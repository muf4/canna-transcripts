[00:00.000 --> 00:03.040]  with this phytocannabinoid diet.
[00:03.040 --> 00:07.480]  So this, I'm not expecting you to be able to understand
[00:07.480 --> 00:09.960]  a lot of the details that are on this slide,
[00:09.960 --> 00:11.480]  because I know there's a lot of it.
[00:11.480 --> 00:16.480]  In fact, I teach my students and our staff
[00:17.080 --> 00:20.960]  at Precision Light Molecules a lot of these portions
[00:20.960 --> 00:23.280]  of this phytocannabinoid diet.
[00:23.280 --> 00:26.960]  And what you see there is basically everything
[00:26.960 --> 00:29.960]  that's going on in the plant.
[00:29.960 --> 00:32.840]  And in the center, you have the CBGA,
[00:32.840 --> 00:35.760]  which is basically the starting molecule
[00:35.760 --> 00:37.760]  of all the cannabinoids in the plant.
[00:37.760 --> 00:42.640]  And what happens is as the plant grows and ages,
[00:42.640 --> 00:46.120]  there's a lot of environmental factors and conditions
[00:46.120 --> 00:48.600]  that basically influence what's happening
[00:48.600 --> 00:52.080]  with the whole profile of cannabinoids in the plant.
[00:52.080 --> 00:57.080]  So sunlight, temperature, the air, oxidation,
[00:57.800 --> 00:59.960]  there's enzymes all over the place.
[00:59.960 --> 01:03.320]  So this entire phytocannabinoid diet
[01:03.320 --> 01:07.320]  could take years to explain in detail.
[01:07.320 --> 01:10.040]  And it's a fascinating, fascinating science.
[01:10.040 --> 01:14.040]  And we have it hanging all over our company.
[01:14.040 --> 01:16.200]  We have two sites in Denver,
[01:16.200 --> 01:19.040]  and we always have to refer back to it
[01:19.040 --> 01:22.040]  to figure out which cannabinoid are we looking at,
[01:22.040 --> 01:24.280]  and how is the plant making it,
[01:24.320 --> 01:26.520]  because it's really, really complex.
[01:32.700 --> 01:34.940]  Let me not forget to teach you a little German.
[01:34.940 --> 01:39.940]  So the pharmacy, pharmacy factory,
[01:41.340 --> 01:44.980]  the hemp plant and the cannabis plant,
[01:44.980 --> 01:46.580]  marijuana as well as hemp,
[01:46.580 --> 01:50.300]  both of them are basically pharma factories.
[01:50.300 --> 01:54.540]  So they have all of these amazing cannabinoids in there,
[01:54.540 --> 01:58.180]  but that's just a tiny little bit of the compounds
[01:58.180 --> 01:59.780]  that you can find in there.
[01:59.780 --> 02:02.460]  For example, another major constituent
[02:02.460 --> 02:05.020]  in the plant is terpenes.
[02:05.020 --> 02:08.660]  Terpenes are the wonderful smelling molecules
[02:08.660 --> 02:12.860]  that give you a sense of aroma.
[02:12.860 --> 02:17.180]  For example, what's in there is a lot of pine extracts
[02:17.180 --> 02:20.580]  that, you know, if you smell a pine tree,
[02:20.580 --> 02:23.900]  the terpene that's in the pine tree is the same terpene
[02:24.260 --> 02:26.900]  that you can also find in cannabis.
[02:26.900 --> 02:30.820]  Also another terpene that I love is linden mol
[02:30.820 --> 02:35.220]  or citra that you can find in citrus fruit.
[02:35.220 --> 02:38.180]  So terpenes have actually been shown to have
[02:38.180 --> 02:41.420]  very important bioactivity as well,
[02:41.420 --> 02:44.060]  and they can actually work hand in hand
[02:44.060 --> 02:48.500]  in this perfect marriage with the cannabinoids
[02:48.500 --> 02:51.020]  in an effect that's called the Amont-Relig effect,
[02:51.020 --> 02:53.420]  in which the two can work synergistically
[02:53.940 --> 02:57.740]  to actually give a bit of greater bioactivity.
[02:57.740 --> 02:59.660]  And there have been studies published,
[02:59.660 --> 03:01.140]  and more will be coming out,
[03:01.140 --> 03:03.820]  on how terpenes are really beneficial
[03:03.820 --> 03:08.100]  for anti-inflammatory applications and pain.
[03:09.580 --> 03:11.900]  Now, the other things that are in there is
[03:13.140 --> 03:16.740]  we are also dealing with a lot of cannaflavins
[03:16.740 --> 03:19.780]  as well as fats, lipids, amino acids.
[03:19.780 --> 03:21.300]  I mean, the list goes on and on,
[03:21.340 --> 03:25.780]  and we're having thousands of amazing compounds in cannabis.
[03:29.420 --> 03:33.740]  So let's discuss major and minor cannabinoids,
[03:33.740 --> 03:37.500]  because before I came here today,
[03:37.500 --> 03:42.140]  I actually conducted a poll of the participants
[03:42.140 --> 03:45.500]  at this expo, and the majority of the people
[03:45.500 --> 03:46.580]  kind of heard about this,
[03:46.580 --> 03:48.780]  well, what is a minor cannabinoid?
[03:48.820 --> 03:50.220]  But then there are some people
[03:50.220 --> 03:52.460]  who did not know what that means.
[03:52.460 --> 03:54.820]  So let's talk about what is major,
[03:54.820 --> 03:56.700]  what's a minor cannabinoid.
[03:56.700 --> 04:00.820]  So in marijuana, for example, THCA,
[04:00.820 --> 04:04.220]  or after decarboxylation, THC,
[04:04.220 --> 04:07.500]  is basically present in its majority.
[04:07.500 --> 04:12.500]  So the highest concentrated cannabinoid is THCA,
[04:13.300 --> 04:16.900]  or then after decarboxylation, THC.
[04:16.900 --> 04:19.100]  Now, when the farm bill was signed,
[04:19.100 --> 04:22.740]  and things became legal, the THC folks,
[04:22.740 --> 04:24.780]  they were so smart, and they were able to,
[04:24.780 --> 04:28.820]  with breeding and genetics, to bring the THC down
[04:28.820 --> 04:33.260]  and outregulate the gene that produces CBD.
[04:33.260 --> 04:35.220]  So back then, in the marijuana plant,
[04:35.220 --> 04:37.340]  CBD was a minor, and then it evolved
[04:37.340 --> 04:40.820]  into the major cannabinoid now in hemp.
[04:40.820 --> 04:44.620]  And the same thing actually applies to CPG.
[04:44.620 --> 04:48.180]  Two years ago, CPG had a premium price,
[04:48.180 --> 04:51.020]  and it was considered one of the minor cannabinoids,
[04:51.020 --> 04:54.340]  meaning it's present only in very small concentrations
[04:54.340 --> 04:58.620]  in cannabis, and again, it's become really, really smart
[04:58.620 --> 05:02.260]  in breeding and selectively isolating the gene
[05:02.260 --> 05:05.300]  that's responsible to make CPG a majority.
[05:05.300 --> 05:09.260]  So now, you can buy CPG in the amounts,
[05:09.260 --> 05:12.860]  almost similar prices to CBD, a little more expensive.
[05:12.860 --> 05:16.140]  So when we're talking about minor cannabinoids now,
[05:16.140 --> 05:18.500]  that really means that these are the cannabinoids
[05:18.500 --> 05:22.580]  that are present in pretty low concentrations in the plant.
[05:22.580 --> 05:27.060]  But, make no mistake, these minor cannabinoids,
[05:27.060 --> 05:30.260]  next year's might be the next big hit on the market
[05:30.260 --> 05:32.380]  and become the major cannabinoids,
[05:32.380 --> 05:34.860]  because in reality, when you investigate
[05:34.860 --> 05:37.620]  these minor cannabinoids, there's really nothing
[05:37.620 --> 05:41.340]  that's so minor about them, because we shouldn't really
[05:41.460 --> 05:43.860]  be looking at them and care about what they do.
[05:45.580 --> 05:48.260]  So, why should we care exactly?
[05:48.260 --> 05:52.980]  Well, we shouldn't care because we have this very important
[05:52.980 --> 05:56.580]  system called the endocannabinoid system.
[05:56.580 --> 06:00.660]  And the endocannabinoid system is a system
[06:00.660 --> 06:03.620]  that has been not very well studied yet,
[06:03.620 --> 06:06.820]  and it's pretty new, it was discovered about 20 years ago,
[06:06.820 --> 06:11.820]  and it really has revolutionized the field of medicine
[06:12.660 --> 06:14.780]  for those of you who are studying it.
[06:14.780 --> 06:17.260]  Unfortunately, in medical school,
[06:17.260 --> 06:19.780]  only 10% of our nation in medical school
[06:19.780 --> 06:22.940]  really teaches about this system that's so important.
[06:22.940 --> 06:25.460]  It's located in the mid-central nervous system,
[06:25.460 --> 06:28.140]  and it has these two major receptors in there
[06:28.140 --> 06:30.860]  that are called CB1 and CB2.
[06:30.860 --> 06:33.820]  And the cannabinoids, the major as well as the minor
[06:33.860 --> 06:38.860]  cannabinoids directly act on these CB1 and CB2 receptors.
[06:40.180 --> 06:43.460]  Now, there's tons of other receptors in our bodies,
[06:43.460 --> 06:45.540]  but these are the ones that the cannabinoids
[06:45.540 --> 06:48.820]  actually target, because these are also the receptors
[06:48.820 --> 06:53.460]  that our internal cannabinoids, we have actually
[06:53.460 --> 06:56.020]  naturally occurring cannabinoids in our body
[06:56.020 --> 06:57.860]  that we call endocannabinoids,
[06:57.860 --> 07:00.820]  and these bind to those receptors,
[07:00.820 --> 07:03.220]  and that's how we even discover that system.
[07:04.820 --> 07:11.860]  All right, so the question is, that I get a lot,
[07:14.140 --> 07:18.580]  well, what do these minor cannabinoids actually do?
[07:18.580 --> 07:22.660]  And to answer that question is not just a very simple,
[07:22.660 --> 07:24.340]  well, they do this and they do that,
[07:24.340 --> 07:27.220]  but here's the issue with that.
[07:27.220 --> 07:31.900]  Now, we have learned a lot about CBD, right?
[07:31.900 --> 07:34.420]  We have learned a lot about THC,
[07:34.420 --> 07:37.300]  because we actually have clinical data,
[07:37.300 --> 07:40.140]  clinical trials, research.
[07:40.140 --> 07:45.140]  We have FDA-approved drugs that use THC or CBD,
[07:46.860 --> 07:49.020]  or a combination thereof.
[07:49.020 --> 07:54.020]  But what's still pretty rare is to have clinical trials
[07:54.180 --> 07:58.140]  that are placebo-controlled, double-blind,
[07:58.140 --> 08:01.260]  and for the minor cannabinoids.
[08:01.300 --> 08:06.060]  So what we have to do right now is almost lean
[08:06.060 --> 08:10.780]  on anecdotal evidence of what these minor cannabinoids do.
[08:10.780 --> 08:13.380]  And there's nothing wrong with anecdotal evidence,
[08:13.380 --> 08:17.140]  because let's not forget, the way how we figured out
[08:17.140 --> 08:20.700]  that CBD works with seizures is because of anecdotal
[08:20.700 --> 08:23.580]  evidence, when it was used for childhood,
[08:23.580 --> 08:27.100]  and then on childhood.
[08:27.100 --> 08:30.500]  Now, let's, for example, CBN.
[08:30.540 --> 08:33.340]  CBN is one of the biggest sellers right now
[08:33.340 --> 08:37.940]  in the hemp market, on the consumer-facing product market.
[08:37.940 --> 08:42.940]  And anecdotally, people say CBN is great for rest,
[08:43.060 --> 08:48.020]  for sleep, for insomnia, anxiety, things like that.
[08:48.020 --> 08:51.180]  But we don't have a full-blown human study,
[08:51.180 --> 08:52.620]  a clinical trial.
[08:52.620 --> 08:56.140]  What we do have is a clinical trial taken in CBN
[08:56.140 --> 08:59.060]  on a very rare skin condition.
[08:59.060 --> 09:04.060]  So the studies are really just slowly emerging now.
[09:04.260 --> 09:07.260]  And if you think about it, you have to ask yourself,
[09:07.260 --> 09:08.420]  well, why is that?
[09:08.420 --> 09:12.860]  Well, number one, we are just now really discovering
[09:12.860 --> 09:15.900]  these minor cannabinoids and learning about them.
[09:15.900 --> 09:19.460]  Number two, the access to these compounds
[09:19.460 --> 09:22.260]  is still pretty difficult, especially before the whole
[09:22.260 --> 09:25.940]  farm bill, when universities really had a tough time
[09:25.980 --> 09:29.820]  getting funding for these types of research projects,
[09:29.820 --> 09:32.740]  or there was a lot of stigma that was attached
[09:32.740 --> 09:36.340]  for academicians to engage in this field.
[09:36.340 --> 09:40.900]  And so that's the reason why research is still
[09:40.900 --> 09:43.460]  at this infancy right now.
[09:43.460 --> 09:47.380]  But the good news is that the federal funding agencies,
[09:47.380 --> 09:49.300]  like the National Institutes of Health
[09:49.300 --> 09:51.580]  and the National Science Foundation,
[09:51.580 --> 09:54.020]  they're actually paying attention,
[09:54.020 --> 09:56.220]  and they're recognizing something,
[09:56.220 --> 09:58.580]  that there's a lot of potential in this field.
[09:58.580 --> 10:01.460]  And they're putting up major funding opportunities,
[10:01.460 --> 10:06.460]  a lot of money to fund projects that are so relevant
[10:06.900 --> 10:10.820]  that will bring us data so we can learn
[10:10.820 --> 10:15.020]  about these cannabinoids that are giving us
[10:15.020 --> 10:16.980]  a lot of analytical evidence.
[10:17.900 --> 10:21.300]  So the NIH is funding right now that has not even
[10:21.300 --> 10:22.900]  expiration dates listed.
[10:22.900 --> 10:25.460]  So you can just apply.
[10:25.460 --> 10:28.180]  And in trying to research plant molecules,
[10:28.180 --> 10:31.940]  we're collaborating with the University of South Carolina,
[10:31.940 --> 10:33.980]  the medical school, and the project in which
[10:33.980 --> 10:36.140]  they're using myocannabinoids,
[10:36.140 --> 10:40.340]  and doing cell signaling studies in collaboration.
[10:40.340 --> 10:43.340]  So things like that are now starting to come up,
[10:43.340 --> 10:45.100]  and I'm super excited about them,
[10:45.100 --> 10:48.580]  because that's what we need to validate our data.
[10:51.530 --> 10:53.890]  I apologize for being over here,
[10:54.570 --> 10:55.570]  because I don't know what's like.
[10:55.570 --> 10:57.250]  We're on, it's like,
[10:58.530 --> 11:00.650]  I can't really see what's like.
[11:09.330 --> 11:11.210]  Talking about isolates now.
[11:11.210 --> 11:16.210]  So isolates are compounds that are very pure.
[11:16.250 --> 11:21.250]  I consider an isolate a compound that is 99% purity
[11:21.290 --> 11:22.370]  or higher.
[11:22.370 --> 11:27.370]  So let's talk about why we want to give isolates
[11:28.370 --> 11:33.370]  sort of a really, really great reputation.
[11:34.130 --> 11:37.010]  Because a lot of the myocannabinoids that we make
[11:37.010 --> 11:41.850]  at precision plant molecules are highly pure
[11:41.850 --> 11:46.050]  and rare cannabinoids in a newly isolate format.
[11:46.050 --> 11:50.290]  Now, number one, isolates are pure.
[11:51.370 --> 11:55.010]  They are inexpensive.
[11:55.050 --> 11:59.610]  They are free of any kind of like pesticides,
[11:59.610 --> 12:01.850]  fungicides, herbicides.
[12:01.850 --> 12:05.650]  And what's really great is a lot of these
[12:05.650 --> 12:06.970]  are nice and simple.
[12:06.970 --> 12:11.570]  So like, really, they're being collected,
[12:11.570 --> 12:13.970]  and they share the same everything.
[12:13.970 --> 12:17.050]  They're all the same, same ingredients.
[12:17.050 --> 12:19.930]  And they're all formulated the same way,
[12:19.930 --> 12:21.490]  and to do a microdosing.
[12:21.490 --> 12:24.330]  And the great thing about isolates as well,
[12:24.850 --> 12:27.250]  I don't want to sound too pro-isolate here
[12:27.250 --> 12:29.370]  because I also like the full-length extracts
[12:29.370 --> 12:30.770]  because of the entourage effect.
[12:30.770 --> 12:35.770]  But isolates can be put into various types
[12:36.490 --> 12:38.130]  of delivery mechanisms.
[12:38.130 --> 12:39.810]  So you can put them in gummies.
[12:39.810 --> 12:41.210]  You can put them in gel caps.
[12:41.210 --> 12:43.090]  You can put them in tinctures.
[12:43.090 --> 12:47.370]  You can put them in topicals, transdermal patches.
[12:47.370 --> 12:51.610]  But what I consider to be most relevant
[12:51.650 --> 12:54.370]  when it comes to the overall global space
[12:54.370 --> 12:59.370]  is that isolates are supposed to be 100% THC-free.
[13:01.650 --> 13:03.970]  And that is an important implication
[13:03.970 --> 13:06.370]  because a lot of countries around the world
[13:06.370 --> 13:10.410]  just don't allow any THC due to legalities.
[13:10.410 --> 13:14.690]  So isolates are good to make THC-free products
[13:14.690 --> 13:18.130]  as well as you can add them into any kind of
[13:18.170 --> 13:21.330]  like full-spectrum extract to enhance
[13:21.330 --> 13:23.330]  or to reinforce the profile,
[13:23.330 --> 13:26.970]  and to also do custom types of formulations.
[13:30.570 --> 13:31.650]  So Ursprung.
[13:33.330 --> 13:36.850]  Ursprung is another German word meaning origin.
[13:36.850 --> 13:41.850]  Where do we get these minor terminamins from?
[13:42.170 --> 13:44.810]  To my knowledge, there's three ways.
[13:44.810 --> 13:48.170]  Number one is directly from the plant,
[13:48.170 --> 13:50.010]  which basically means,
[13:50.010 --> 13:52.890]  I would almost say it's closest to nature
[13:52.890 --> 13:56.050]  because we're extracting minor cannabinoids
[13:56.050 --> 13:58.290]  directly out of the plant.
[13:58.290 --> 14:01.970]  Now, the challenge there is that
[14:01.970 --> 14:04.130]  since the minor cannabinoids are present
[14:04.130 --> 14:06.250]  in such small concentration,
[14:06.250 --> 14:09.810]  it takes a lot of extract and a lot of isolation
[14:09.810 --> 14:12.890]  to get a reasonable amount of these.
[14:12.930 --> 14:15.090]  The other way to get to minors
[14:15.090 --> 14:18.570]  is by a process called conversions.
[14:18.570 --> 14:22.210]  So the conversions can occur either directly
[14:22.210 --> 14:26.970]  from the plant to my molecule as a starting material,
[14:26.970 --> 14:31.970]  or they can be made with individual starting materials
[14:32.090 --> 14:34.330]  like terpenes that can react together
[14:34.330 --> 14:36.650]  to make minor cannabinoids.
[14:36.650 --> 14:40.410]  And then finally, there's also bioengineered fermentation
[14:40.570 --> 14:44.410]  that you can use in order to express these minor cannabinoids
[14:44.410 --> 14:46.850]  in either yeast or bacteria.
[14:46.850 --> 14:50.330]  So the perfect analogy that I like to use
[14:50.330 --> 14:51.770]  in order to understand this,
[14:51.770 --> 14:54.850]  because plant-derived cannabinoids,
[14:54.850 --> 14:55.970]  that's easy to understand.
[14:55.970 --> 14:58.690]  You squeeze the plant and you get the new cannabinoid.
[14:58.690 --> 15:03.090]  But conversions, I like to use the word,
[15:03.090 --> 15:05.010]  for example, vitamin C.
[15:05.010 --> 15:07.890]  All of us know that we don't squeeze vitamin C
[15:07.930 --> 15:10.690]  out of oranges and lemons anymore, right?
[15:10.690 --> 15:12.570]  We know that vitamin C is produced
[15:12.570 --> 15:14.290]  in the pharma-type environment
[15:15.170 --> 15:19.090]  in a converging, in a synthetic pathway.
[15:19.090 --> 15:23.210]  And so that's how you can also get cannabinoids.
[15:23.210 --> 15:25.370]  In this case, minor cannabinoids.
[15:25.370 --> 15:29.610]  And then with bioengineered fermentation techniques,
[15:29.610 --> 15:32.690]  I like to use the example of insulin.
[15:32.690 --> 15:34.610]  So it used to be that you had to take
[15:34.610 --> 15:36.730]  a whole bunch of pancreases
[15:36.730 --> 15:38.970]  and squeeze out the pancreatic material
[15:38.970 --> 15:40.850]  to get all this insulin.
[15:40.850 --> 15:45.850]  But now, we can just enhance the gene in yeast or bacteria
[15:46.890 --> 15:48.890]  and that expresses insulin.
[15:48.890 --> 15:52.410]  And now, you know, millions of people around the world
[15:52.410 --> 15:55.210]  are being helped with diabetes.
[15:55.210 --> 15:58.930]  So that's how I like to think about these different ways
[15:58.930 --> 16:00.930]  of sourcing cannabinoids.
[16:04.010 --> 16:06.210]  All right, now we're getting to a topic
[16:06.690 --> 16:10.810]  that I actually see Matt from Delta-8 Science here.
[16:10.810 --> 16:11.650]  Hello.
[16:12.570 --> 16:14.610]  Now we're getting into the big boom
[16:14.610 --> 16:18.810]  that happened last year and even a bigger boom this year,
[16:18.810 --> 16:21.730]  which is Delta-8 THC.
[16:21.730 --> 16:26.730]  So Delta-8 THC is making a gigantic impact
[16:27.170 --> 16:29.010]  right now on the market.
[16:30.050 --> 16:31.530]  Right around the corner back there,
[16:31.530 --> 16:34.690]  I saw somebody showing their amazing Delta-8 shadow,
[16:34.690 --> 16:35.890]  for example.
[16:36.450 --> 16:41.130]  Now, why is that molecule grabbing our attention?
[16:41.130 --> 16:44.850]  Why is that molecule dominating
[16:44.850 --> 16:47.210]  everything we're talking about right now?
[16:47.210 --> 16:51.810]  Why is it in this central stage of attention?
[16:51.810 --> 16:56.370]  Well, number one, it's pretty inexpensive.
[16:56.370 --> 17:01.050]  Number two, and this comes always back to
[17:01.050 --> 17:03.370]  what do you actually feel
[17:03.370 --> 17:06.330]  when you take something into your body, right?
[17:07.450 --> 17:11.050]  CBD, we know, can help you a lot with pain, with pain.
[17:11.050 --> 17:15.730]  At least some people report, I can feel CBD,
[17:15.730 --> 17:18.370]  but some people report, I cannot feel CBD.
[17:18.370 --> 17:20.570]  It doesn't really do anything for me.
[17:20.570 --> 17:24.210]  But most people should know that THC, Delta-9,
[17:24.210 --> 17:25.930]  does something to them, right?
[17:25.930 --> 17:28.290]  It definitely makes people high.
[17:28.290 --> 17:30.210]  We know that as a fact.
[17:30.210 --> 17:34.530]  Delta-8 has a small structural change,
[17:34.530 --> 17:37.730]  and it's also a molecule that can make you high.
[17:37.730 --> 17:40.650]  And so the reason why people are so interested in it,
[17:40.650 --> 17:41.810]  in purchasing it,
[17:41.810 --> 17:44.610]  because it actually allows you to feel something.
[17:44.610 --> 17:47.370]  And in this case, it allows you to feel barraged,
[17:47.370 --> 17:50.570]  which is the German word I want to teach you today.
[17:50.570 --> 17:53.170]  And barraged means it makes you high.
[17:53.170 --> 17:56.090]  And it might not make you as high as Delta-9,
[17:56.090 --> 17:59.570]  but it definitely has a psychotropic effect.
[18:01.210 --> 18:02.050]  Oh.
[18:07.130 --> 18:09.850]  Oh yeah, okay, so like I said, it's inexpensive,
[18:09.850 --> 18:14.850]  and it can also be easily converted from hemp-derived CBD
[18:15.610 --> 18:18.050]  or marijuana-derived THC.
[18:18.050 --> 18:23.050]  So it's a very simple process to convert into Delta-8.
[18:23.610 --> 18:26.130]  So this is a great opportunity right now
[18:26.130 --> 18:31.130]  for people who are risking enough
[18:31.970 --> 18:36.970]  to slide through the uncertain legal landscape.
[18:38.090 --> 18:39.690]  It's an opportunity for people
[18:39.690 --> 18:43.450]  to bring a product to the market that is amazing.
[18:44.330 --> 18:47.570]  But also, we have to pay attention to the fact
[18:47.570 --> 18:52.570]  that right now, we're in this cloud of unknown regulations.
[18:53.530 --> 18:58.530]  So anybody who is now making great Delta-8 THC,
[18:58.530 --> 19:00.210]  it's not just bad, right?
[19:01.330 --> 19:02.170]  Or TPM.
[19:03.850 --> 19:08.290]  At one point, some of the three-letter regulating agencies
[19:08.290 --> 19:10.490]  might put the kaboom on it.
[19:13.490 --> 19:16.210]  So let me talk a little bit about the science,
[19:16.210 --> 19:18.090]  and I'm not making it too complex,
[19:18.090 --> 19:23.090]  but Delta-8 THC is just a wealth of a treasure trove
[19:23.290 --> 19:28.290]  that still needs to be opened and discovered.
[19:31.210 --> 19:34.450]  And the reason why is Delta-8,
[19:34.450 --> 19:37.290]  when it enters the market,
[19:37.290 --> 19:39.490]  it can actually enter the market
[19:39.490 --> 19:43.290]  not at a very high 99-cent purity level
[19:43.290 --> 19:46.930]  that I was talking about with regards to isolate earlier.
[19:46.930 --> 19:49.450]  So oftentimes, what you see on the market right now
[19:49.490 --> 19:54.330]  is about a 90 to 95% Delta-8,
[19:54.330 --> 19:58.770]  and then there's a bunch of other little things in there,
[19:58.770 --> 20:02.090]  and these other little things are the isomers.
[20:02.090 --> 20:05.850]  And these isomers are complex,
[20:05.850 --> 20:10.650]  and it opens up a whole new area of research and testing
[20:10.650 --> 20:15.650]  and questions like, do we know what these isomers do?
[20:15.650 --> 20:19.250]  Do we know what Delta-7, Delta-8, Delta-10 exact is?
[20:20.050 --> 20:22.530]  There's two types of Delta-10s there.
[20:22.530 --> 20:23.570]  Do we know what they do?
[20:23.570 --> 20:24.810]  Well, we don't.
[20:24.810 --> 20:27.330]  Do they work really great together,
[20:27.330 --> 20:29.650]  or do they not work great together?
[20:29.650 --> 20:30.690]  Are they good?
[20:30.690 --> 20:33.370]  Could they be bioactive or not?
[20:33.370 --> 20:36.250]  These are just things that we need to really be
[20:36.250 --> 20:38.010]  paying attention to right now.
[20:45.240 --> 20:50.240]  All right, and this slide brings me to a very important,
[20:50.240 --> 20:51.080]  thank you.
[20:51.080 --> 20:54.480]  This slide brings me to a very important message
[20:54.480 --> 20:59.320]  for all of you who are in the cannabis space,
[20:59.320 --> 21:01.640]  making major or minor campaigns.
[21:01.640 --> 21:05.160]  Make sure that you have a testing partner,
[21:05.160 --> 21:09.120]  a testing lab that you can very well converse with,
[21:09.120 --> 21:12.720]  work together, scientific exchanges.
[21:12.720 --> 21:14.720]  Just make sure that the testing partner
[21:14.720 --> 21:17.480]  is able to do a lot of the things
[21:17.480 --> 21:19.120]  that you're asking them to do.
[21:19.120 --> 21:23.080]  So for example, everybody knows right now,
[21:23.080 --> 21:24.560]  we send something to this lab,
[21:24.560 --> 21:26.880]  it's a different result than when we send it to this lab.
[21:26.880 --> 21:30.120]  So there's right now some challenges we have to overcome,
[21:30.120 --> 21:32.200]  such as inconsistencies.
[21:32.200 --> 21:34.120]  We don't have all of the standards yet
[21:34.120 --> 21:35.840]  for all of these different isomers.
[21:35.840 --> 21:37.640]  And sometimes some of these isomers
[21:37.640 --> 21:40.280]  can actually mispick and for Delta-9,
[21:40.280 --> 21:42.640]  and then everybody is up in arms saying,
[21:42.640 --> 21:44.880]  oh, I wouldn't want to have all of this
[21:44.880 --> 21:47.320]  non-compliant product, Delta-9.
[21:47.360 --> 21:50.160]  Well, it might not be Delta-9,
[21:50.160 --> 21:52.080]  it might just be a doppelganger, right?
[21:52.080 --> 21:54.440]  One of those other cannabinoids.
[21:58.560 --> 22:00.680]  This brings me to my,
[22:02.520 --> 22:05.160]  not the last German word that I'm gonna teach you today,
[22:05.160 --> 22:06.560]  but the last before the last.
[22:06.560 --> 22:09.040]  So the Zukunft means the future,
[22:09.040 --> 22:13.520]  but there's actually a better word of the future.
[22:13.560 --> 22:18.240]  And that is a word that my colleague actually,
[22:18.240 --> 22:20.480]  co-founder of Precision and Molecules,
[22:20.480 --> 22:22.800]  just reminded me of yesterday.
[22:22.800 --> 22:27.000]  And this word is called the fingerschmiedzinkerfinger.
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.800]  And it's a long word,
[22:29.800 --> 22:33.240]  but it has a meaning that I can't really capture
[22:33.240 --> 22:34.680]  in the English language.
[22:34.680 --> 22:38.560]  But what it means is finger means fingers,
[22:38.560 --> 22:41.120]  and you can feel it in your fingers.
[22:41.240 --> 22:46.240]  In wartime, the generals, when they were in combat,
[22:46.240 --> 22:49.760]  there were generals that were put out there
[22:49.760 --> 22:52.440]  to feel when there was a combat coming,
[22:52.440 --> 22:56.000]  or to feel when it was just perfect to do the attack.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.560]  And this is my fingerschmiedzinkerfinger
[22:58.560 --> 23:00.080]  for the future.
[23:00.080 --> 23:03.320]  Number one, in the next couple of years,
[23:03.320 --> 23:05.320]  we will still be confused.
[23:05.320 --> 23:07.840]  We will still not know if Delta-8
[23:07.840 --> 23:10.040]  or some of the other compounds
[23:10.040 --> 23:12.200]  that are emerging in the market,
[23:12.200 --> 23:14.360]  are they legal, are they illegal?
[23:14.360 --> 23:16.640]  Well, it really depends on who you talk to.
[23:16.640 --> 23:18.960]  These lawyers interpret the law this way.
[23:18.960 --> 23:21.280]  These lawyers interpret the law this way.
[23:21.280 --> 23:23.280]  It's just gonna be still a very much
[23:23.280 --> 23:26.040]  of a confusing legal landscape.
[23:26.040 --> 23:27.520]  The other thing that I predict
[23:27.520 --> 23:29.480]  when fingerschmiedzinkerfinger is,
[23:30.480 --> 23:34.040]  we are now on the perfect path
[23:34.040 --> 23:39.040]  for increasing research and clinical trials.
[23:39.920 --> 23:43.840]  And just this week, I hope some of you saw
[23:43.840 --> 23:45.280]  these amazing headlines,
[23:45.280 --> 23:48.120]  Frontpage News with valid care.
[23:48.120 --> 23:51.200]  They just published their studies.
[23:51.200 --> 23:54.200]  12 companies participated in this trial,
[23:54.200 --> 23:55.760]  this research study,
[23:55.760 --> 23:59.520]  that basically the data was submitted to the FDA,
[23:59.520 --> 24:00.880]  and it came back really great,
[24:00.880 --> 24:02.760]  and showed that none of these products
[24:02.800 --> 24:04.960]  that are in the market have any kind of
[24:04.960 --> 24:09.520]  liver toxicity, and now it's happening with testosterone.
[24:09.520 --> 24:12.040]  And there's other contract research labs out there
[24:12.040 --> 24:13.840]  that are not doing very similar things,
[24:13.840 --> 24:15.480]  like Sanjay Labs.
[24:15.480 --> 24:18.360]  And so I think that this is exciting times
[24:18.360 --> 24:20.240]  that we're actually getting data,
[24:20.240 --> 24:25.240]  and this will help us make formulations
[24:25.360 --> 24:28.160]  that are actually specific to an individual person,
[24:28.160 --> 24:30.160]  because we're not all the same, right?
[24:30.160 --> 24:32.000]  I'm a female, you're a male.
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.360]  I'm old, you're young.
[24:33.360 --> 24:34.880]  I live there, you live there.
[24:34.880 --> 24:37.800]  So we all have very individual needs,
[24:37.800 --> 24:41.080]  and these are the times where we can cater
[24:41.080 --> 24:43.920]  to this personalized and bespoke
[24:43.920 --> 24:46.480]  cannabinoid-based healthy wellness.
[24:51.290 --> 24:54.290]  So up here you see my contact information.
[24:55.290 --> 24:58.850]  Andrea Holmes, Precision Plant Molecules.
[24:59.690 --> 25:03.410]  Typically when you just go on Google,
[25:04.290 --> 25:06.770]  you can check in on Andrea Holmes,
[25:06.770 --> 25:07.850]  Precision Plant Molecules,
[25:07.850 --> 25:10.290]  you will get immediately my contact information.
[25:11.330 --> 25:12.170]  Thank you.
[25:18.730 --> 25:21.330]  Live with you guys at the NOCO Hemp Expo.
[25:21.330 --> 25:23.810]  That was just Dr. Andrea Holmes.
[25:23.810 --> 25:25.650]  We're gonna have a live interview with her
[25:25.650 --> 25:27.650]  in just a few minutes, so you guys stay with us.
[25:27.650 --> 25:29.370]  We're gonna be live all day,
[25:29.370 --> 25:32.170]  just talking and speaking with some of the brightest minds
[25:32.170 --> 25:33.970]  here at NOCO Hemp Expo.
[25:33.970 --> 25:37.130]  This is the largest hemp expo here in the nation.
[25:38.690 --> 25:40.170]  Sorry about that.
[25:41.730 --> 26:19.500]  Hey, this is Precision Plant Molecules.
[26:19.500 --> 26:21.220]  There we go, how's that?
[26:21.220 --> 26:22.180]  Unmuted.
[26:23.580 --> 26:28.580]  So anyway, that was Brian and Dager,
[26:29.340 --> 26:31.580]  Dager, I can never pronounce his name right,
[26:31.580 --> 26:36.260]  but anyway, they're at the NOCO Hemp Expo.
[26:37.580 --> 26:40.780]  They are learning on the fly the ins and outs
[26:40.900 --> 26:44.780]  of streaming audio and video,
[26:44.780 --> 26:46.180]  but we got the video down,
[26:46.180 --> 26:48.300]  at least you could see the woman speaking.
[26:49.380 --> 26:52.180]  Trying to teach them how to do the audio stuff
[26:52.180 --> 26:54.100]  from a distance on the fly.
[26:54.980 --> 26:59.540]  They have an iPhone, so I said try to get a line out
[26:59.540 --> 27:03.780]  from the soundboard into the, but then the iPhone,
[27:03.780 --> 27:08.780]  you know, you need the stereo to lightning bolt adapter,
[27:09.780 --> 27:11.900]  and then I don't know if the iPhone,
[27:11.900 --> 27:15.300]  well actually it should have an audio in capability
[27:15.300 --> 27:17.100]  because the microphone's doing that.
[27:19.260 --> 27:24.260]  But so they're, I think, gonna bring that woman down
[27:24.540 --> 27:29.540]  to the booth, which is there.
[27:30.220 --> 27:32.660]  You may recognize that dab table,
[27:33.580 --> 27:36.660]  that dab bar from such past conversations
[27:36.660 --> 27:38.540]  as every Thursday at 11.
[27:43.020 --> 27:46.540]  Yes, yes, Brian and, whoops,
[27:46.540 --> 27:48.700]  and the guy who talks all the time, yes.
[27:50.740 --> 27:53.260]  Sorry, let me kill that, but I gotta go pick up
[27:55.060 --> 27:57.500]  or check in on my two-year-old
[27:57.500 --> 28:01.100]  who's at the neighbor's house.
[28:02.340 --> 28:03.500]  Give me one second.
[28:04.500 --> 28:07.500]  So hopefully these guys'll come down.
[28:09.100 --> 28:16.200]  So I am going to, you can all bear with us.
[28:19.640 --> 28:24.640]  I'm gonna make them big and enable their audio,
[28:24.920 --> 28:29.920]  and there may be a big gap of silence,
[28:29.920 --> 28:31.600]  but for all the new people coming in,
[28:31.640 --> 28:32.800]  for all the new people coming in,
[28:32.800 --> 28:39.330]  maybe some of you can tell them what's going on
[28:40.330 --> 28:41.650]  just to chill out for a minute
[28:41.650 --> 28:46.650]  as our not-so-tight live production plays out.
[28:52.050 --> 28:55.810]  Yeah, and I have, actually, the cherry pie I brought outside.
[28:57.130 --> 29:02.130]  I'm acclimating it to the direct sunlight from Mr. Toad.
[29:04.130 --> 29:09.130]  All right, so again, Brian is gonna bring that woman
[29:10.850 --> 29:15.850]  who was just speaking down to that table,
[29:18.690 --> 29:23.690]  and I told him to try to kill the PA microphone,
[29:24.250 --> 29:26.570]  or the PA speaker, I should say,
[29:31.120 --> 29:33.320]  but generally you'll be able to hear them much better.
[29:33.360 --> 29:36.400]  They got their USB mic.
[29:39.520 --> 29:43.440]  We can go to a two-shot, but all right, I gotta run out.
[29:43.440 --> 29:48.440]  I'll be back in 10, and I'm just gonna put them live
[29:48.440 --> 29:51.200]  and let them know to start talking,
[29:51.200 --> 29:54.960]  but for all the new people coming in,
[29:54.960 --> 29:56.360]  being like, what the fuck is this?
[29:56.360 --> 29:59.660]  If you guys can just let them know, just be patient,
[29:59.660 --> 30:00.840]  and I'll be back in 10.
[30:16.810 --> 30:18.810]  I'm gonna go to the bar.
[30:18.810 --> 30:20.810]  Imagine that that was a six-mile road.
[30:20.810 --> 30:22.810]  You think that's what it would have been.
[30:22.810 --> 30:27.810]  You would see a stick come from 200 million in 2017
[30:27.810 --> 30:32.810]  to 428,600, and 2,820 white stick curve,
[30:34.210 --> 30:39.210]  or a solid rock, or a new mechanical
[30:39.850 --> 30:42.010]  in the night-view or the open space.
[30:42.010 --> 30:43.210]  It would be really well.
[30:43.210 --> 30:45.370]  It is one mechanical,
[30:45.890 --> 30:47.930]  and we track it in the night-view or open space,
[30:47.930 --> 30:50.570]  and it's doing well, and it's growing.
[30:50.570 --> 30:54.010]  So what you see here, and that's the origin of this chart,
[30:54.010 --> 30:56.730]  is not the opening of 2020,
[30:56.730 --> 30:59.770]  but the solid scale from 2019.
[30:59.770 --> 31:01.610]  Let's break that down.
[31:01.610 --> 31:05.850]  Now, we're seeing that as a fad gradient.
[31:06.890 --> 31:09.850]  It didn't continue on that trajectory.
[31:09.850 --> 31:12.970]  It became more and more complex,
[31:12.970 --> 31:15.610]  and we, it's flattened out.
[31:15.610 --> 31:19.090]  So let's take a look at the year of 2018,
[31:21.290 --> 31:26.410]  and that's a mechanical in the night-view
[31:26.410 --> 31:27.930]  or the open space.
[31:28.970 --> 31:31.450]  Whereas it's only in one category,
[31:31.450 --> 31:34.490]  more than two-thirds of the in-night-view supplements,
[31:34.490 --> 31:39.290]  20% almost, or you're selling it in tons,
[31:39.370 --> 31:42.810]  and that's all inflated,
[31:42.810 --> 31:44.010]  and we all hear about it,
[31:44.010 --> 31:47.610]  but it's all inflated by the mass market's conservative.
[31:47.610 --> 31:49.610]  So we get the tendency to think
[31:49.610 --> 31:52.090]  that it's just a lot of understanding.
[31:52.090 --> 31:54.490]  The pharmacy is the best for that,
[31:54.490 --> 31:56.650]  or the pharmacy has that kind of win-long,
[31:56.650 --> 31:57.770]  a little momentary,
[31:57.770 --> 32:00.090]  not having the competencies that are likely for their
[32:00.090 --> 32:01.210]  other ones.
[32:01.210 --> 32:03.530]  That's a solid category,
[32:03.530 --> 32:04.490]  and it's growing.
[32:04.490 --> 32:08.330]  It's three and 12% of the beverages
[32:08.490 --> 32:11.210]  that are being sliced and traded,
[32:11.210 --> 32:13.930]  just a negative 13% of the products
[32:13.930 --> 32:15.370]  that are being traded
[32:15.370 --> 32:17.130]  to the high-end distributors
[32:17.130 --> 32:19.050]  such as Nutel and so on.
[32:19.050 --> 32:20.730]  We have a lot of high-end.
[32:20.730 --> 32:22.250]  We have a lot of low-end distributors
[32:22.250 --> 32:25.290]  that do our survey information here.
[32:25.290 --> 32:27.850]  74% of the U.S. consumers
[32:27.850 --> 32:29.290]  have been distributed in the survey
[32:29.290 --> 32:30.090]  in the last year,
[32:30.090 --> 32:32.970]  74% of the consumers are familiar with CVD,
[32:32.970 --> 32:36.170]  37% of those who have been familiar
[32:36.250 --> 32:38.410]  with CVD charts have purchased CVD,
[32:38.410 --> 32:40.410]  and 21% of those who survey
[32:40.410 --> 32:42.410]  are familiar with CVD.
[32:42.410 --> 32:44.410]  Yes, that's a lot of people.
[32:44.410 --> 32:48.330]  So that's a lot of various numbers.
[32:48.330 --> 32:50.730]  We see those same numbers here.
[32:50.730 --> 32:53.130]  74% of the firms that have purchased one
[32:53.130 --> 32:56.010]  give you a tendency to 16%
[32:56.010 --> 32:58.970]  of those firms that have purchased
[32:58.970 --> 33:02.090]  in the 12 months prior to the survey.
[33:02.090 --> 33:03.530]  What's important about this chart,
[33:03.530 --> 33:04.330]  not for me,
[33:04.490 --> 33:06.250]  is that all of these numbers are true.
[33:06.250 --> 33:07.850]  Every single one of these numbers
[33:07.850 --> 33:10.090]  applies to a marginal wage survey
[33:10.090 --> 33:11.370]  or a premium average survey
[33:11.370 --> 33:13.290]  or a premium pointage survey.
[33:13.290 --> 33:15.850]  Things are going in the right direction.
[33:15.850 --> 33:17.130]  This is nice for you to look at.
[33:17.130 --> 33:18.090]  Nice to be interested.
[33:18.090 --> 33:18.890]  These are not signals.
[33:18.890 --> 33:20.410]  There are always survey respondents,
[33:20.410 --> 33:22.170]  but things are looking good
[33:22.170 --> 33:24.170]  for the industry.
[33:26.650 --> 33:30.410]  So, again, we didn't hit 100% growth rate
[33:30.410 --> 33:32.010]  by extra percent growth.
[33:32.090 --> 33:33.690]  What we're interested in is
[33:33.690 --> 33:34.730]  the people who are buying.
[33:34.730 --> 33:36.970]  So fewer people who are buying
[33:36.970 --> 33:39.930]  the frequency of the frequency
[33:39.930 --> 33:42.890]  of the data now and the usage frequency
[33:42.890 --> 33:45.290]  of the purchase rates and the usage frequency.
[33:45.290 --> 33:47.290]  Less people are paying
[33:47.290 --> 33:49.290]  and more people are purchasing.
[33:49.290 --> 33:50.890]  So we have a system of
[33:50.890 --> 33:52.250]  people who are buying
[33:52.250 --> 33:53.370]  and people who are trading
[33:53.370 --> 33:54.410]  and people who are selling
[33:54.410 --> 33:55.690]  and people who are trading now.
[33:55.690 --> 33:58.090]  We have a point of 119 survey.
[33:58.090 --> 34:00.090]  So we move up there.
[34:00.410 --> 34:02.410]  We did cover all the information,
[34:02.410 --> 34:04.410]  but still, you know,
[34:04.410 --> 34:06.330]  we're not able to go to the premium
[34:06.330 --> 34:08.330]  to the market.
[34:08.330 --> 34:11.930]  So, the problem is not really
[34:11.930 --> 34:13.130]  the reason that we're doing
[34:13.130 --> 34:14.170]  the survey.
[34:14.170 --> 34:16.170]  We had an 80% of consumers
[34:16.170 --> 34:18.970]  who paid more because
[34:18.970 --> 34:20.570]  they were taking care of COVID.
[34:20.570 --> 34:22.090]  70% of consumers were less
[34:22.090 --> 34:23.290]  because of COVID.
[34:23.290 --> 34:24.410]  So they can't speak to each other.
[34:24.410 --> 34:27.130]  Now, most consumers say that
[34:27.130 --> 34:29.610]  COVID had no impact on all consumers
[34:29.610 --> 34:30.970]  who were purchasing.
[34:30.970 --> 34:32.970]  It's mostly about financial concern
[34:32.970 --> 34:34.970]  according to our survey.
[34:34.970 --> 34:36.970]  We have a point of 105
[34:36.970 --> 34:38.970]  that increases the importance
[34:38.970 --> 34:40.970]  of their purchases because of financial concern.
[34:40.970 --> 34:42.970]  The hype made me wear a cop.
[34:42.970 --> 34:44.970]  And I have to wear a mask.
[34:44.970 --> 34:46.970]  Are we sitting here?
[34:46.970 --> 34:48.970]  We're supposed to be in 119.
[34:48.970 --> 34:50.970]  We're educating 25 kids.
[34:50.970 --> 34:52.970]  Our business partner is coming out.
[34:52.970 --> 34:54.970]  We're supposed to be in 119.
[34:54.970 --> 34:56.970]  Can we take masks out?
[34:56.970 --> 34:58.970]  Absolutely. That's why we're here.
[34:58.970 --> 35:00.970]  We can take masks off if you want.
[35:00.970 --> 35:05.650]  We might be live right now.
[35:05.650 --> 35:07.650]  Oh yeah? That's not good.
[35:07.650 --> 35:09.650]  Hey, what's up everybody?
[35:09.650 --> 35:11.650]  I had no idea that we're live.
[35:11.650 --> 35:13.650]  I was waiting on the gear.
[35:13.650 --> 35:15.650]  This is a huge expo.
[35:15.650 --> 35:17.650]  Obviously, it's the largest expo in the country.
[35:17.650 --> 35:19.650]  So we're trying to navigate
[35:19.650 --> 35:21.650]  and go around.
[35:21.650 --> 35:23.650]  I'm not sure if you can see me.
[35:23.650 --> 35:25.650]  I'm not sure if you can see me.
[35:25.650 --> 35:27.650]  I'm not sure if you can see me.
[35:27.650 --> 35:29.650]  I'm not sure if you can see me.
[35:29.650 --> 35:31.650]  So we're trying to navigate and go around.
[35:31.650 --> 35:33.650]  I'm not sure if you saw Dr. Andrea Holmes
[35:33.650 --> 35:35.650]  live talking
[35:35.650 --> 35:37.650]  about how important the
[35:37.650 --> 35:39.650]  Manners Collaboratives are to women.
[35:39.650 --> 35:41.650]  So let me get this setup.
[35:41.650 --> 35:43.650]  Hello everyone.
[35:43.650 --> 35:45.650]  Since we're live
[35:45.650 --> 35:47.650]  I'm just going to say hi.
[35:47.650 --> 35:49.650]  I'm Andrea Holmes, chief growth
[35:49.650 --> 35:51.650]  officer of Precision Plant Molecules.
[35:51.650 --> 35:53.650]  I'm also co-founder
[35:53.650 --> 35:55.650]  of Precision Plant Molecules.
[35:55.650 --> 35:57.650]  I'm also a university professor
[35:57.650 --> 36:02.650]  Nebraska and there I'm a chemistry professor as well as the director of cannabis studies.
[36:02.650 --> 36:08.450]  Hi guys, I'm Alex Rados. I work in sales for Precision Pimolecules and sell the things
[36:08.450 --> 36:12.650]  that she gets to produce for me. Try to keep her busy.
[36:12.650 --> 36:16.650]  So let's kind of go more into what you just were talking about. I think a lot of our viewers,
[36:16.650 --> 36:20.650]  you know, a lot of these guys are newer to cultivating cannabis. A little bit of our
[36:20.650 --> 36:24.650]  background is we go out of our way to educate every Thursday on how to grow cannabis using
[36:24.650 --> 36:28.650]  the microbial world. So we're really big on making sure that cannabis is medicine,
[36:28.650 --> 36:33.650]  hemp is medicine. And again, genetics play a huge proponent of that. So one of the main
[36:33.650 --> 36:38.650]  things that we feel like that we want to learn more, especially these viewers as well, is
[36:38.650 --> 36:45.650]  what is it that these minor cannabinoids add to the entourage effect? So CBN is the umbrella
[36:45.650 --> 36:49.650]  of all the different minor cannabinoids. Let's kind of walk through that and educate the
[36:49.650 --> 36:50.650]  viewers.
[36:51.650 --> 36:57.650]  Sure. So actually the mother of all cannabinoids is CBGA. So that's where it all starts in
[36:57.650 --> 37:08.650]  the plant. And CBGA then is converting into a big, big, big variety of cannabinoids, including
[37:08.650 --> 37:14.650]  the major cannabinoids, which is THC and CBD. But the minor ones are really starting to
[37:15.650 --> 37:21.650]  make a big splash in the market. And you asked me about why do we care with regard to the
[37:21.650 --> 37:25.650]  entourage effect? Well, just like the major cannabinoids, the minor cannabinoids are also
[37:25.650 --> 37:31.650]  acting on the endocannabinoid system. And the receptors in the endocannabinoid system,
[37:31.650 --> 37:38.650]  they're very smart and they're actually binding with these cannabinoids. And so the entourage
[37:38.650 --> 37:43.650]  effect, I like to explain it very simple to people where one plus one equals 10. So
[37:43.650 --> 37:49.650]  basically the effect, the outcome is greater than the individual summation of the individual
[37:49.650 --> 37:51.650]  parts.
[37:53.650 --> 37:57.650]  You were going to go into more of like, you know, if we're looking for a quality product,
[37:57.650 --> 38:01.650]  what makes a quality product? You know, we hear that everybody uses the word full spectrum.
[38:01.650 --> 38:03.650]  Can I go into that?
[38:04.650 --> 38:07.650]  For me, a quality product is something you can replicate every time. And there's some
[38:07.650 --> 38:12.650]  things that, you know, you may have a full spectrum, you just don't want to say where
[38:12.650 --> 38:16.650]  it's different every single time. I have a 62 and an 8. Whereas when you are dealing
[38:16.650 --> 38:21.650]  with ISA, it's more of a repeatable, consistent product. And that's kind of what we focus
[38:21.650 --> 38:26.650]  in is something that can be replicated on a basis every week and depending on a lot
[38:26.650 --> 38:27.650]  of things.
[38:28.650 --> 38:35.650]  Can I add to that? From a scientific perspective, a quality product is something that you actually
[38:35.650 --> 38:41.650]  know what's in it. You know, so that you can actually know, okay, this is the percentage
[38:41.650 --> 38:45.650]  of this type of cannabinoid that's in the product or these are the terpenes and it's
[38:45.650 --> 38:52.650]  free of contaminants. So testing, that is important to determine whether a product is
[38:52.650 --> 38:58.650]  of high quality or not. Now whether you make the distinction of is a broad spectrum or
[38:58.650 --> 39:03.650]  an isolated in a formulation better or more quality, that is really a bigger question
[39:03.650 --> 39:08.650]  that takes a long time to answer because there's the full spectrum fans and then there's
[39:08.650 --> 39:12.650]  the isolated fans. And both of them have advantages and disadvantages.
[39:12.650 --> 39:17.650]  I definitely would say that the crown endeavor is full spectrum. I really enjoy the ultra
[39:17.650 --> 39:22.650]  high spectrum. Again, most of these beers are cultivated at home, cultivated on the
[39:22.650 --> 39:27.650]  IC. So once we start to understand that there are different cannabinoids, the THC isn't
[39:27.650 --> 39:32.650]  the be-all end-all. For our beers, a lot of times we try to equate that to like ever clear
[39:32.650 --> 39:36.650]  alcohol just because that's the highest alcohol content. That doesn't necessarily mean it's
[39:36.650 --> 39:42.650]  what it tastes like. And there's certain reasons why people choose to consume ever clear.
[39:42.650 --> 39:47.650]  But at the same time, that's not really making you feel great. If you're trying to enjoy
[39:47.650 --> 39:50.650]  a high end bourbon or something like that, you wouldn't drink an ever clear on their
[39:50.650 --> 39:54.650]  locks because it's borderline moonshine. And I feel like that's the same way with a lot
[39:54.650 --> 39:57.650]  of these people, especially tourists that are coming into town for the HempEx World
[39:57.650 --> 40:02.650]  this weekend, is they think THC is the be-all end-all. That was something else that we were
[40:02.650 --> 40:06.650]  talking about. Delta A is something else that I feel like a lot of people need to learn
[40:06.650 --> 40:10.650]  about. THC A is something else that I feel like a lot of people need to understand. Because
[40:10.650 --> 40:13.650]  when you give that to children, that's not getting them high enough. And a lot of people
[40:13.650 --> 40:18.650]  don't understand the difference between THC and THC A. Could you go through that a little
[40:18.650 --> 40:25.650]  bit more? Sure. So in the plant, the compound that we find is THC A or CBD A or in fact,
[40:25.650 --> 40:31.650]  all of the cannabinoids have that particular group on them that's called the acid. That's
[40:31.650 --> 40:38.650]  why we call them acids, right? Acids and nutrients. And yes, these acids actually don't have
[40:38.650 --> 40:45.650]  any psychotropic effects on the body, but they actually do have a lot of properties
[40:45.650 --> 40:50.650]  that are still very important. So a lot of the acids, for example, are being requested
[40:50.650 --> 40:59.650]  right now. They are penetrating the market for patients that feel nauseous, for example,
[40:59.650 --> 41:05.650]  during chemotherapy. I've seen people talk about that a lot. So the acids are not to
[41:05.650 --> 41:10.650]  be underestimated. And it's not just like, let's smoke it and decarboxylate so we can
[41:10.650 --> 41:17.650]  get the high. Let's pay attention to the acids. Let's pay attention to THC, THC A. And then
[41:17.650 --> 41:24.650]  the other big confusion, like I was just talking about is Delta A. Well, Delta A and Delta
[41:24.650 --> 41:32.650]  9, they're very close when you look at the chemical structure. But if you look a little
[41:32.650 --> 41:38.650]  bit closer and you actually look at the science of these two compounds, they're kind of structurally
[41:38.650 --> 41:44.650]  different, even though they look the same. But if you look at the molecule from a three-dimensional
[41:44.650 --> 41:48.650]  standpoint, they're quite different and they can do different things. But they also, because
[41:48.650 --> 41:53.650]  some of the similarities can do the same thing. So what's really cool about Delta 9 is it
[41:53.650 --> 42:01.650]  helps people feel relaxed. They get high. You know, it's a cannabinoid that people enjoy.
[42:01.650 --> 42:07.650]  Delta A is very similar in that respect. It has psychotropic properties, so it can
[42:07.650 --> 42:14.650]  make people very relaxed and they get high. Not quite as much as with Delta 9 maybe because
[42:14.650 --> 42:20.650]  the binding might not be the same as with Delta 9 to those receptors in the endocannabinoid
[42:20.650 --> 42:29.650]  system. But then the other confusing cannabinoid that's now making a big splash and sounds
[42:29.650 --> 42:37.650]  very similar to THC is THCV. THCV is now Delta 9 and Delta A THCV. So whenever I'm
[42:37.650 --> 42:43.650]  talking about THCV, people don't quite grasp the fact that I'm not talking about THC.
[42:43.650 --> 42:49.650]  And those are two super interesting molecules as well. They're looking very similar to THC,
[42:49.650 --> 42:53.650]  but there are structural differences on the molecule.
[42:54.650 --> 43:00.650]  That's why we appreciate you taking the time to educate me here at NoCoHempExpo 2021.
[43:00.650 --> 43:04.650]  Because again, I think the minor cannabinoids is what's really going to allow people like
[43:04.650 --> 43:08.650]  my mother over here in Georgia. You know, she's starting to come around on cannabis
[43:08.650 --> 43:11.650]  because she's getting a little bit older and she's seeing that there are certain ways that
[43:11.650 --> 43:16.650]  she can consume cannabis without having to smoke. There's a lot of benefits actually
[43:16.650 --> 43:21.650]  to using those minor cannabinoids, especially with the second brain, as we like to call
[43:21.650 --> 43:26.650]  it. So you guys are focusing on improving your stomach, which seems to improve overall
[43:26.650 --> 43:31.650]  health. And a lot of that comes from the cannabinoids that you were speaking about today.
[43:31.650 --> 43:38.650]  Sure. Yeah. And we're moving into a direction of the great, super cool new delivery methods.
[43:38.650 --> 43:44.650]  You don't really have to smoke it anymore. I mean, you could. It's great bioavailability
[43:45.650 --> 43:51.650]  if you smoke it, but then you have a couple other problems with smoking. Inhaling has
[43:51.650 --> 43:57.650]  had some negative effects on people. You can eat it now. You can do transdermal patches.
[43:57.650 --> 44:03.650]  You can do sublingual tablets, gel caps. I mean, it's an arsenal of products that are
[44:03.650 --> 44:07.650]  filling our shelves right now in the dispensaries and in other stores.
[44:07.650 --> 44:11.650]  I think that's one of the main things that we love to see here in Denver, Colorado, is
[44:11.650 --> 44:16.650]  that stigma of just smoking cannabis. Now people that are 9 to 5 can kind of enjoy that,
[44:16.650 --> 44:20.650]  but at the same time, they'll have to smell that cannabis. Especially with cannabinoids
[44:20.650 --> 44:26.650]  when you can dose a lot easier with 5 mg or 10 mg. So we appreciate you guys' time. How
[44:26.650 --> 44:28.650]  can we find out more about you guys here in Denver, Colorado?
[44:28.650 --> 44:34.650]  Yeah, you can look us up on our website, precisionplantmolecules.com, or on Instagram. It's precisionplantmolecules
[44:34.650 --> 44:38.650]  with an underscore in between the two words there, or the three words. Yeah, otherwise
[44:38.650 --> 44:42.650]  you can feel free to reach out to our sales department, sales at Precision Head Molecules,
[44:42.650 --> 44:46.650]  and talk to me, get some samples, all that kind of good stuff, and we can get going.
[44:46.650 --> 44:52.650]  All right, we appreciate you guys' time. Thank you for taking the time to speak. I
[44:52.650 --> 44:56.650]  also do a little bit of public speaking, but I know that there's a lot of back work that
[44:56.650 --> 44:59.650]  goes into putting these presentations. Thank you for your time.
[44:59.650 --> 45:01.650]  Oh, it was my pleasure.
[45:01.650 --> 45:03.650]  Later, y'all.
[45:04.650 --> 45:08.650]  All right, guys, I'm going to get a few more people up there. It might take a few minutes.
[45:08.650 --> 45:12.650]  We can talk in the air and in the intersititial. I'm just going to have some of this stuff
[45:12.650 --> 45:16.650]  so that you guys know. It's been tough. It's hard to get the internet up and running right
[45:16.650 --> 45:20.650]  now here, borrowing. So hopefully, you can keep up with us.
[45:20.650 --> 45:22.650]  Yeah, we can go up to Dr. Anne Little.
[45:22.650 --> 45:27.650]  I can actually see some of the chats that are on the side.
[45:27.650 --> 45:30.650]  Yeah, I've got some questions for you. This is what we do every Thursday.
[45:30.650 --> 45:39.650]  That is so neat. I love it that people give direct feedback. That's great.
[45:39.650 --> 45:42.650]  Acapulco Gold. Yes, Antonio, very cool.
[45:42.650 --> 45:45.650]  All right.
[46:00.650 --> 48:45.480]  Okay, I'm back. What did I miss?
[48:45.480 --> 48:49.480]  All right, let me check in with those guys. I'm assuming, or can someone tell me how it
[48:49.480 --> 48:52.480]  ended? Were they like, we'll be back with more people?
[48:52.480 --> 48:57.480]  Or...
[48:57.480 --> 49:00.480]  Chad!
[49:00.480 --> 49:08.480]  Who did who? Can you hear me?
[49:08.480 --> 49:11.480]  Picking up sticks, picking up sticks. I can hear you.
[49:11.480 --> 49:14.480]  God damn it, I can't hear you.
[49:14.480 --> 49:17.480]  Was it good?
[49:17.480 --> 49:21.480]  God, this fucking thing.
[49:21.480 --> 49:23.480]  Was it good?
[49:23.480 --> 49:26.480]  All right.
[49:26.480 --> 49:29.480]  You hear this amazing radio voice?
[49:29.480 --> 49:31.480]  It's beautiful, isn't it?
[49:31.480 --> 49:34.480]  I do indeed.
[49:34.480 --> 49:37.480]  She ended with Acapulco Gold.
[49:37.480 --> 49:48.480]  The whole interview, but yeah. All right, so we could probably kill the live stream for now, right?
[49:48.480 --> 49:51.480]  DeJear, can you hear me?
[49:51.480 --> 49:59.260]  This is Clem Fandango.
[49:59.260 --> 50:04.660]  Is my voice booming, Alan?
[50:04.660 --> 50:12.600]  All right, let me text.
[50:12.600 --> 50:22.600]  Should we kill live stream for now?
[50:22.600 --> 50:24.600]  Okay.
[50:24.600 --> 50:32.600]  Hello, this is Brown Control to Major Tom.
[50:32.600 --> 50:36.600]  Can you hear me, Major Tom?
[50:36.600 --> 50:38.600]  Sit down, stand up.
[50:38.600 --> 50:42.600]  So, if you can't hear them, they can hear us.
[50:42.600 --> 50:46.600]  Okay.
[50:46.600 --> 50:51.600]  So what's up, guys? Again, we're here live at the NoCo Hemp Expo for 2021.
[50:51.600 --> 50:53.600]  This is the largest hemp expo in the nation.
[50:53.600 --> 50:56.600]  So there's a ridiculous amount of people upstairs.
[50:57.600 --> 51:02.600]  That's why it took me like almost 15 minutes to go find this damn guy, because there's so much stuff being spread out.
[51:02.600 --> 51:08.600]  Again, Ryan here, he makes a lot of hats that I feel like at least in Denver, Colorado, has gone viral.
[51:08.600 --> 51:09.600]  People love them.
[51:09.600 --> 51:12.600]  Make American Hemp Again is his brand, his slogan.
[51:12.600 --> 51:18.600]  We're going to let Ryan kind of talk about, you know, when he's making these hats, he's also donating to different charities.
[51:18.600 --> 51:23.600]  I feel like that's why a lot of people resonate with his company, is because not only is he making a little money for himself,
[51:24.600 --> 51:27.600]  but he's going out of his way to help other individuals.
[51:27.600 --> 51:31.600]  I believe you say you put like 10% of your profits into that, right?
[51:31.600 --> 51:33.600]  Yeah, we do 10% of our gross.
[51:33.600 --> 51:35.600]  We go back. We're doing it to different causes.
[51:35.600 --> 51:40.600]  Right now we're doing it to just feeding America after 2020, given all the hardship a lot of people faced.
[51:40.600 --> 51:45.600]  But the way we kind of started, the first hat, which, of course, I didn't bring, grabbing everything, was for breast cancer.
[51:45.600 --> 51:49.600]  My mom was going through breast cancer when I came up with the phrase.
[51:49.600 --> 51:53.600]  Not being a politician over here, I just decided to do something and give back.
[51:53.600 --> 51:56.600]  So we started donating back to the National Breast Cancer Foundation.
[51:56.600 --> 51:58.600]  And that was three years ago.
[51:58.600 --> 52:06.600]  Came to the first NoCo Hemp Expo with just 12 black and pink hats and sold them out that weekend and then got asked for, you know, the next ones.
[52:06.600 --> 52:10.600]  This is for addiction. Right here, addiction awareness, we have with the ribbon on the side.
[52:10.600 --> 52:14.600]  I really like this one, too, but I want to point out like the coloring and everything on this.
[52:14.600 --> 52:16.600]  Nice gray, light blue.
[52:16.600 --> 52:26.600]  Again, you know, it's got the mark on there that you guys are, you know, when you're purchasing the hat, that it's going somewhere and not just, you know, got purposes behind it right there.
[52:26.600 --> 52:29.600]  Then we got epilepsy right here.
[52:29.600 --> 52:33.600]  This is for the epilepsy. This is for the Epilepsy Foundation of America.
[52:33.600 --> 52:40.600]  As we all know, all these brands and all these lines go back to different causes that CBD or cannabis is relative to.
[52:40.600 --> 52:44.600]  This is the sick essential extracts collab right here.
[52:44.600 --> 52:45.600]  One of a kind right there.
[52:45.600 --> 52:46.600]  Shout out to Nikiti.
[52:46.600 --> 52:47.600]  That's it.
[52:47.600 --> 52:52.600]  This one is for, donates back to all the victims of the war on drugs.
[52:52.600 --> 52:56.600]  Really, this goes back to the Drug Policy Alliance right here.
[52:56.600 --> 53:00.600]  They started the MORE Act, which is starting to help cannabis reform, which is huge.
[53:00.600 --> 53:10.600]  And then the future, what we're going to do, this is our new American made 55% hemp, bridging all gaps, B&G, Red Bottom, Grimm, Hemp Hats right here.
[53:11.600 --> 53:21.600]  And what we want to transfer into is doing collab works with other companies to promote their brand on an American made hemp hat with our brand here.
[53:21.600 --> 53:22.600]  That's the future.
[53:22.600 --> 53:24.600]  And that's what we're going to look at doing to next year.
[53:24.600 --> 53:25.600]  Let's kind of go into that a little bit.
[53:25.600 --> 53:30.600]  You know, you go out of your way to make sure that these are hand, not machine made, but made in America.
[53:30.600 --> 53:34.600]  I was going to say handmade, but you're, you're basically, you know, by the machine itself.
[53:34.600 --> 53:36.600]  I know that you're, you know, monitoring.
[53:36.600 --> 53:37.600]  So in a way, almost handmade.
[53:37.600 --> 53:39.600]  Here, as best as you can here in America.
[53:39.600 --> 53:47.600]  And I also feel like the quality of these, man, I mean, I've had this hat for like six months now and I really do feel like it's, it just holds its shape.
[53:47.600 --> 53:48.600]  I love the flat brims.
[53:48.600 --> 53:50.600]  I love that it's a limited edition.
[53:50.600 --> 53:53.600]  You know, he partnered with this one with Grassroots.
[53:53.600 --> 53:54.600]  So shout out to those guys as well.
[53:54.600 --> 53:56.600]  They always make a quality hat.
[53:56.600 --> 53:59.600]  And it's something that I love to rock, whether he was here or not.
[53:59.600 --> 54:00.600]  I just wear this hat a lot.
[54:00.600 --> 54:03.600]  You guys see me on Thursday rocking this hat as well.
[54:03.600 --> 54:07.600]  Here in Denver, Colorado, you know, him and also our boy up there.
[54:07.600 --> 54:09.600]  He only has one man in his boots.
[54:09.600 --> 54:12.600]  So I got to kind of, but shout out to a Genome Alchemy as well.
[54:12.600 --> 54:14.600]  These guys are right next to each other.
[54:14.600 --> 54:22.600]  And I feel like, you know, you guys have gone out of your way to go from a small business now to a thriving little empire here that you're really starting to build.
[54:22.600 --> 54:25.600]  And it's great to see, you know, you doing your thing.
[54:25.600 --> 54:28.600]  And of course, Greg doing his thing upstairs as well.
[54:28.600 --> 54:29.600]  Thank you.
[54:29.600 --> 54:30.600]  We're trying to and working on it.
[54:30.600 --> 54:32.600]  And back to the collabs.
[54:32.600 --> 54:35.600]  I did one with Genome, put his logo on the front of the collabs.
[54:35.600 --> 54:44.600]  And really where it started is I wanted to do something with the Make American Happy again that wasn't just political, you know what I mean, and to go down that path.
[54:44.600 --> 54:46.600]  So that's why I wanted to donate back.
[54:46.600 --> 54:51.600]  And it kind of sparked something different, you know, from a passion project going into seeing it and where it's grown to.
[54:51.600 --> 54:56.600]  And I really like seeing it go to the American-made hat manufacturing.
[54:57.600 --> 55:02.600]  Because if you're thinking about it, Make American Happy again should be on a hemp hat, which some of these are.
[55:02.600 --> 55:04.600]  But it should be on American-made hemp hat.
[55:04.600 --> 55:12.600]  And after everything that's going on last year, I like knowing and I think people like knowing that, you know, this gives somebody a job.
[55:12.600 --> 55:14.600]  This promotes American-made hemp right here.
[55:14.600 --> 55:15.600]  It sends a message.
[55:16.600 --> 55:26.600]  We also donate back to Feeding America, which for every $1, that feeds 10 meals to people in need throughout the country, which all the different causes are great.
[55:26.600 --> 55:32.600]  After 2020, I think that's the most noble thing I think we've done as a company is help put food in other people's bellies.
[55:41.120 --> 55:42.120]  American Hemp Again.
[55:42.120 --> 55:44.120]  Say it again. We were muted there.
[55:44.120 --> 55:47.120]  Yeah, so my name is Ryan Criscolo.
[55:47.120 --> 55:49.120]  We're out of Longmont, Colorado.
[55:49.120 --> 55:51.120]  Just moved there, started in Fort Collins.
[55:51.120 --> 55:57.120]  Our Instagram is Make American Hemp Again with an N and has underscores in between.
[55:57.120 --> 56:00.120]  And then we also have Bridging All Gaps.
[56:00.120 --> 56:02.120]  Get the bag, baby.
[56:02.120 --> 56:03.120]  In my bag.
[56:03.120 --> 56:04.120]  This is what we're talking about.
[56:04.120 --> 56:05.120]  Bag boys over here.
[56:05.120 --> 56:07.120]  So follow us, Bridging All Gaps, too.
[56:07.120 --> 56:10.120]  And Make American Hemp Again, give us a shout out.
[56:10.120 --> 56:11.120]  Give us a tag.
[56:11.120 --> 56:15.120]  Our website is www.bridgingallgaps.com.
[56:15.120 --> 56:17.120]  We have CBD products.
[56:17.120 --> 56:18.120]  We have hemp hats.
[56:18.120 --> 56:19.120]  We have masks, too.
[56:19.120 --> 56:22.120]  A lot of things we're working on trying to build this empire.
[56:22.120 --> 56:25.120]  And I really just want to take a minute to say thank you to Brian and his team.
[56:25.120 --> 56:29.120]  Brian reached out months ago, and we just kind of just started vibing.
[56:29.120 --> 56:34.120]  Really, as you see people through this industry, it's kind of funny who sticks along and who doesn't.
[56:34.120 --> 56:37.120]  But I really appreciate kind of what they bring to the industry.
[56:37.120 --> 56:43.120]  Everybody's out here promoting themselves, and you need people to help promote your business and your brand.
[56:43.120 --> 56:47.120]  Because one thing I noticed is whoever creates the brand usually isn't great at promoting the brand.
[56:47.120 --> 56:49.120]  So you kind of need somebody to put it out there.
[56:49.120 --> 56:55.120]  So I do appreciate that, and everybody tuning in, come follow us, Make American Hemp Again,
[56:55.120 --> 56:57.120]  and let's keep making American hemp again.
[56:57.120 --> 57:00.120]  They want to know real quickly about what the pricing on those hats are.
[57:00.120 --> 57:05.120]  So $40 for the hemp hats over here and the American-made ones, too.
[57:05.120 --> 57:09.120]  And then we have $25 for the regular classic non-hemp hats.
[57:09.120 --> 57:14.120]  And then any of the collab hats right here, $30.
[57:14.120 --> 57:17.120]  Only a few of those left and only a few collab hats.
[57:17.120 --> 57:19.120]  Yeah, and these are limited edition, especially that one.
[57:19.120 --> 57:23.120]  That's why I jumped on so I could make sure that I got mine as well.
[57:23.120 --> 57:24.120]  Very. These two selling out.
[57:24.120 --> 57:28.120]  We only have about a half a dozen of these left and these.
[57:28.120 --> 57:31.120]  Again, Ryan's well-known here in Denver, Colorado.
[57:31.120 --> 57:36.120]  So for you guys that fly out here or check out his website, again, these are quality hats.
[57:36.120 --> 57:37.120]  I have nothing to do with Ryan.
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.120]  I just love his products and stuff like that, and that's the reason why I brought him here.
[57:41.120 --> 57:43.120]  Nothing to gain other than just promoting a friend.
[57:43.120 --> 57:44.120]  Appreciate you.
[57:44.120 --> 57:45.120]  Absolutely, brother.
[57:45.120 --> 57:47.120]  Check us out. Thank you for your time, everybody.
[57:47.120 --> 57:50.120]  Come through booth 203 if you're at NOCO Hemp Expo.
[57:50.120 --> 57:51.120]  Come check us out.
[57:51.120 --> 57:53.120]  I'm going to go grab some more people.
[57:53.120 --> 57:55.120]  We're going to continue going with this.
[57:55.120 --> 57:56.120]  Just give me a few minutes.
[57:56.120 --> 57:57.120]  Got it.
[57:57.120 --> 57:58.120]  Appreciate you, guys.
[57:58.120 --> 58:03.950]  All right.
[58:06.950 --> 58:12.950]  This is our completely unprepared live stream from the NOCO Hemp Expo.
[58:12.950 --> 58:15.950]  We're doing the best we can.
[58:15.950 --> 58:19.950]  Antonio, he's just grabbing people from their booths.
[58:19.950 --> 58:24.950]  I guess this guy was right next to Gene Ohm Alchemy's booth.
[58:24.950 --> 58:30.950]  But anyway, let me play some music while we're waiting.
[58:30.950 --> 58:41.140]  So everyone, give me a second to swap out the audio source.
[58:41.140 --> 58:43.140]  All right, so you are out.
[58:43.140 --> 58:45.140]  Let's turn you way down.
[58:45.140 --> 59:00.250]  And this one is in.
[59:00.250 --> 59:05.250]  About 10 seconds away.
[59:05.250 --> 59:07.250]  Maybe 20.
[59:07.250 --> 59:32.820]  So I'll take this.
[59:32.820 --> 59:40.450]  Hold on.
[59:40.450 --> 59:49.230]  Can you all hear the music?
[59:49.230 --> 59:53.230]  This is probably going to kill our stream.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.220]  All right, so you can hear it.
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:40.510]  Let me actually do something that probably won't get us in trouble.
[01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:42.510]  Hold on.
[01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:46.510]  Let me switch the music.
[01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:50.510]  All right, YouTube algorithms.
[01:00:50.510 --> 01:01:31.300]  Look at that exciting expo hall.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:35.770]  Check, check, check.
[01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:38.770]  We are picking up sticks now.
[01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:40.770]  Hear that?
[01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:42.770]  I can hear you picking up sticks.
[01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:44.770]  Peter.
[01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:50.770]  Do that, boy.
[01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:52.770]  Okay.
[01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:56.770]  I'm going to mute you because we're listening to music right now.
[01:01:57.770 --> 01:02:01.770]  I'm going to put on some of that Dom Dala.
[01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:10.240]  Are we in the loading area?
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:12.240]  Are you turning it up?
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:16.240]  I just turned the music up.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.240]  I'm going to mute you.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:23.690]  I'm going to mute you.
[01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:25.690]  I'm going to mute you.
[01:02:25.690 --> 01:02:27.690]  I'm going to mute you.
[01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:29.690]  I'm going to mute you.
[01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:31.690]  I'm going to mute you.
[01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:39.430]  I'm going to turn the music up.
[01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:42.430]  It's a beautiful exhibit hall.
[01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:55.430]  Can you hear me?
[01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:57.430]  Picking up sticks.
[01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:59.430]  Picking up sticks.
[01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:02.430]  Nice.
[01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:07.820]  Now you sound lower.
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:09.820]  How about now?
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:11.820]  Now you're nice and booming.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:13.820]  I had to mess with the gain.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.820]  Now I can hear your fresh beats.
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.820]  Hold on.
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.820]  I'll turn it up, Aaron.
[01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:30.820]  Okay.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:38.820]  Put your headphones on, sir.
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:40.820]  What's up future cannabis project?
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:48.820]  I got one of the highlighted booths here at no co-hef expo for 2021.
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:52.700]  except the interior parts are made of hemp.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:55.220]  They kind of like refurbished a Mazda Miata,
[01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:56.300]  if I'm saying that correctly.
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.420]  Yeah, it's re-bodied.
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:58.260]  Re-bodied.
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.340]  You can take your mask off down there.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:00.260]  Oh, okay, thanks, man.
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.100]  We trust each other.
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:02.540]  All right.
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.140]  Yeah, so we wanted to kind of understand more.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.820]  I mean, you know, upstairs,
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.220]  hopefully we can show that as well.
[01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:09.220]  I did a short little interview with you
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:10.500]  earlier this morning,
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.060]  but we wanted to talk to the viewers
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.740]  so that you guys can kind of,
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.340]  so they can kind of find out what more you've been up to.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:17.180]  Okay.
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.740]  And that is a beautiful little Mazda Miata,
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.620]  the best looking Mazda Miata, to be honest,
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:22.460]  that I've seen.
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:25.060]  Actually, Mazda wrote up an article about it
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:26.900]  a couple of years ago when we did the prototype.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.420]  So this is just a newer, updated version.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:30.260]  Right on.
[01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:31.580]  Even Mazda was impressed.
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:32.420]  Yeah.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.500]  But it's just a body, Ryan,
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.700]  that's actually been redone on this car.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.540]  Right.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:39.380]  And also the-
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.220]  That's what I was trying to say.
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.740]  I kind of fumbled my words there.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:43.900]  Everything that's not mechanical is made of hemp.
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:44.820]  Well, just the body.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:45.660]  Just the body.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:46.980]  So there's plenty of other things,
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.380]  you know, the tires and the-
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:49.860]  Sure.
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:50.700]  Windshield and this sort of thing.
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.140]  But that's a common thing.
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:54.820]  People go like, oh, the entire car's made of hemp,
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:56.140]  and that's not really possible.
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:59.900]  But the story behind the car, right,
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:04.900]  is like every other guy, every other young guy,
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:06.940]  you know, you want to design your own car
[01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.180]  at a certain point in your life.
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:09.980]  So about seven years ago,
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:13.020]  I set out and I tried to design my own car.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.620]  And I carved the body.
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:17.260]  I made what's called a body buck, right?
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:18.780]  Once you got a body buck done,
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.100]  you make it out of whatever materials you need.
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:22.580]  You shave it down, you make it look perfect.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:23.940]  It looks like a real car.
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.460]  And you make molds out of that.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:28.340]  At that point, I read this book, right?
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:29.980]  That's Jack Herrera's book,
[01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.940]  Vamper Wears No Clothes.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:33.980]  Jack Herrera rhymes with terror.
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:34.820]  Jack Herrera.
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.860]  Jack Herrera rhymes with terror, right?
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.140]  And that's the prototype, right?
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:41.460]  That's the car that I built.
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:44.420]  So when I was making molds to make that car,
[01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:47.860]  I had to decide what material I was going to use.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.900]  And I read this book, and in chapter,
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.460]  I think it's chapter nine,
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:53.860]  there's a whole story about how Henry Ford.
[01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:55.660]  I remember that.
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.420]  He was 66 years old.
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.620]  He decided all his cars in the future
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.780]  were going to be made out of plant material.
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:03.740]  Sounds good.
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:05.060]  Pretty wild, right?
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.500]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:09.220]  Henry Ford was not only one of the greatest entrepreneurs
[01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:12.420]  and greatest inventors,
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:15.700]  but he was also one of the greatest polluters in the world.
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:19.820]  So he got to be good friends with a guy named John Burroughs
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:23.820]  who was one of the best known authors in the early 1900s.
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:28.060]  And he wrote about nature and this sort of thing, et cetera.
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.420]  And so John Burroughs got kind of ticked off
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.700]  at Henry Ford one day and sent him a message
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.620]  and saying, you're destroying the planet.
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:39.420]  And so Henry Ford said to his guys,
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:42.420]  ship Burroughs a brand new Model T
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:44.100]  and tell him he needs to get back out
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.580]  in nature a little bit.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.020]  And so it turns out he and Thomas Edison
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:50.380]  and Burroughs and Harvey Firestone
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.700]  started to travel all around the country.
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:54.780]  They called themselves the Vagabonds
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:59.460]  and to experience nature
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:03.940]  and drive around in Ford automobiles, obviously.
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:06.060]  And so they went around.
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:07.100]  One of the main things they did
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:09.700]  is they looked at how to make things
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.940]  without destroying the planet.
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:15.860]  So they would take a look at all these old mills
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:20.860]  and water mills where they would grind up grain
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.060]  and they were water powered.
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:25.860]  It was hydro powered manufacturing
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.940]  and they would make different products at these mills.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:33.740]  And Ford created like 25 of these different small factories
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:35.220]  that were all hydro powered.
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:38.300]  And he started to make things like plastic steering wheels
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:41.260]  from soybeans and paint from soybeans, et cetera.
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.500]  So he was the first guy to envision the idea
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:48.260]  of going carbon negative in the 1914s.
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:50.100]  So as he got a little older
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.900]  and he had all the money in the world,
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:55.180]  he realized that his giant manufacturing facilities
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:59.300]  like in Detroit with these huge, huge smokestacks, et cetera
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:00.940]  were really terrible for the planet.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:02.740]  So that's when he decided that all cars
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.700]  would have to be made out of plant material
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:06.020]  as much as possible.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:08.300]  So his prototype was actually made out
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.940]  of 50% plant material.
[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:12.980]  And that was the inspiration that I had
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:15.740]  was Henry Ford back in 1941.
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:18.700]  So this car that you see here at the show today
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:22.220]  actually uses about 100 times more,
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:25.460]  I'm sorry, 10 times more hemp than Henry Ford used.
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.260]  His car was about 7%.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:29.140]  Everybody calls it the hemp car.
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:31.420]  My car is much more of a hemp car than that.
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.500]  And he used it, what he did is he took
[01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.380]  just randomly oriented hemp fiber
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:40.060]  and sisal and wheat straw, et cetera,
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:44.620]  and held it all together with a thought
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:48.700]  to have been a soybean resin to hold it all together.
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:51.300]  Very similar to what we look at
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:54.100]  as fiberglass or carbon fiber today.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.020]  But now things have changed
[01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:59.020]  and now the strongest types of fabrics
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.300]  that can be used to make cars are woven.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.100]  So this is a woven material,
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:06.420]  much like the cloth that we're wearing right now.
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:09.220]  That's what goes into the current hemp car today.
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:10.780]  So a lot more hemp.
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:14.340]  That body's about 70%.
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:16.660]  Now can you, like the look of carbon fiber,
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:19.260]  I know I like that, I have that on one of my cars
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:20.700]  actually kind of that look.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:21.980]  Is there a way that you can make
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:24.200]  the hemp fiber just as strong?
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:28.500]  Well, strong is kind of a weird word.
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.780]  And people have misquoted me all the time
[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:35.000]  saying that hemp is 10 times stronger than steel.
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.900]  In engineering terms, and I'm not an engineer,
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:42.580]  none of them talk in terms of strength.
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:44.980]  They talk about tensile strength or compressive strength,
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.220]  et cetera, and modulus and all that stuff.
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:51.340]  But the bottom line to answer your question,
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:56.980]  most, I would say at least half of all applications
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:00.900]  for steel, fiberglass, carbon fiber, and aluminum,
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:03.140]  about half the applications, a rough guess,
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.100]  and that's what I'm talking about today
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.780]  when I'm speaking at four o'clock.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.900]  About half of those applications for those materials
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.100]  can be replaced by hemp.
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.820]  Some instances, you're gonna have to use more hemp
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.380]  in order to get the job done.
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.820]  Like carbon fiber, to replace carbon fiber,
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:21.820]  you might have to use one more layer
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:23.680]  in order to get the job done.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.860]  With fiberglass, you might even be able to get away
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:27.920]  with one less.
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:33.580]  With aluminum, you're gonna be able to,
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:38.380]  well, just as an example, the trunk on that car upstairs,
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:46.060]  when it still had a Mazda Miata trunk lid on it,
[01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:49.540]  that trunk lid weighs 15.7 pounds.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:53.780]  The new trunk lid on it, made out of hemp, weighs 8.4 pounds
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:56.660]  so it's a 46% reduction in weight.
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:00.720]  But here's the key, Brian, here's the key.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:05.720]  Right now, about almost eight gigatons of CO2
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:12.280]  is dumped into the atmosphere every year
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:16.860]  by just simply making steel, aluminum, carbon fiber,
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:21.020]  and fiberglass because so much fossil fuel is required
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.660]  to make those materials.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:27.740]  They are some of the worst materials for the planet.
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:30.300]  Absolutely, right up there with cement, right?
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:33.300]  Which is almost, it's pretty much similar amount.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:37.260]  And we all know in the future, in the coming decades,
[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:40.340]  hopefully for you, guys your age,
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:42.980]  you're gonna be concerned about this 30 years from now
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:43.820]  when you're my age.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:44.660]  I'm older than you think.
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:46.260]  Oh, well, you look good.
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.960]  But, not that, your kids, et cetera.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:51.780]  We have to get rid of fossil fuels.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.180]  We have to do it now.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.220]  Now, now, now, now.
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:57.300]  Nobody I've ever presented to
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:59.980]  that comes from the fossil fuel industry
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:01.300]  sends me Christmas cards.
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.140]  I bet.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.380]  You know what I mean?
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.140]  We have to get rid of this stuff
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:07.700]  and we have to get rid of it now.
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.420]  And it's an inevitable situation.
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:13.780]  We will not be making things very often
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.260]  from steel, fiberglass, carbon fiber, and fiber,
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:18.580]  and aluminum in the future.
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:20.780]  It will be on an exceptional basis.
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.660]  You know, when it needs to withstand
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.300]  very high temperatures, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.860]  Natural fibers like hemp won't stand up to that.
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.620]  But for the most applications,
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.700]  I mean, everything around this table,
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:34.820]  this wall right here.
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:35.980]  This could be made out of hemp tree.
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:38.340]  All the stuff, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:40.660]  And what it's doing when you do that,
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:45.660]  instead of materials that dumps CO2 into the atmosphere,
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:50.760]  instead it's going to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere.
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.360]  So what I call this is CARS,
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.640]  which has nothing to do with cars.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:59.520]  It's carbon avoidance and reduction.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.040]  So no one really, not too many people
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.760]  are talking about carbon avoidance,
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.320]  like especially the companies,
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.040]  or the petroleum companies that are supporting
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.840]  a lot of the solutions that are out there right now
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.820]  that you hear about being talked by the IPCC, et cetera.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:20.780]  You have a lot of solutions being proposed
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:24.060]  that basically say we can continue to make stuff
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.060]  out of all these terrible materials.
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:29.860]  We continue to use fossil fuels, right?
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:33.400]  But then we'll figure out other ways to pull CO2 out.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.540]  Carbon avoidance basically says,
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.780]  stop making stuff out of steel, aluminum,
[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:40.980]  carbon fiber, and fiberglass and cement.
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:43.380]  This stuff is, you have to stop using it.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:45.420]  You need something different, right?
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.740]  That's carbon avoidance.
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:50.940]  Carbon reduction is when you actually take CO2
[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.020]  out of the atmosphere.
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:54.300]  So when it comes to hemp,
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.740]  if we actually embrace this concept
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:01.740]  that Henry Ford was really going towards back in 1941.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:06.320]  He never said this, so I'm going to paraphrase him,
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.620]  make everything possible from hemp.
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:11.540]  Because if you do, then you're avoiding dumping CO2
[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:12.980]  into the atmosphere, right?
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:16.280]  By not using steel, by not using aluminum, fiberglass.
[01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:22.220]  And instead, you're going to also reduce the amount
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:24.420]  of CO2 out of the atmosphere by making stuff
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:27.300]  out of things like hemp and other plants.
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.820]  You can use other plants too.
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:32.660]  We don't have to be totally focused on nothing but hemp.
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:37.180]  We all love hemp, but the bottom line is the reason
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.860]  why people are so excited about hemp
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:44.860]  is because it is almost unquestionably
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:49.660]  one of the fastest way to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:51.860]  And you know how fast hemp grows.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:52.700]  Absolutely.
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:54.860]  Right, four times faster than trees.
[01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:59.860]  So, if you talk to some of these people out there
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:03.660]  that are really big on trying to figure out
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:08.660]  how we can reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere,
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:11.500]  there's a great book called Drawdown,
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:14.340]  and it has about 100 different solutions,
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:18.100]  recommendations about how to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:21.300]  or avoid putting CO2 into the atmosphere.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:25.140]  And the number one thing right now,
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:28.860]  according to that book, is to plant trees, right?
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:31.380]  Reforest what's been deforested.
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:35.060]  And if we did that, according to that book,
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:41.060]  we could basically draw down about 5 billion tons,
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:46.860]  five gigatons of CO2 per year out of the atmosphere
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:51.860]  or avoid, by contrast, if we could stop,
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:58.420]  if we could replace 50% of, say,
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:01.180]  all these materials that I'm talking about,
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:03.260]  including cement, right?
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:04.980]  All these structural materials.
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:08.580]  We could actually be at about seven billion tons.
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:11.100]  So, maybe 7.5.
[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.220]  So, 50%, hemp has the opportunity
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:18.780]  to not only be the number one way to save the planet,
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:23.340]  but do so on the order of about 50% more
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:27.020]  than what's currently accepted as the number one way.
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:27.860]  So-
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.340]  I mean, I can only imagine if basically
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:32.780]  what you've been doing started to be implemented in cars,
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:35.820]  the lightness that would be achieved.
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:39.020]  I would imagine NASCAR's gotta be, at some point,
[01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:42.020]  knocking on your door to try to get the cars to be louder.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:44.540]  We need to wrap this up pretty soon?
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.380]  No, no, he just wants us to talk a little bit louder.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:48.420]  We're here, you know, being at the Expo,
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:49.660]  there's a lot of stuff going on.
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:51.660]  Well, I think what you're gonna see
[01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:56.900]  is we're probably gonna see more and more
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:01.540]  of the automotive industry really take this seriously.
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:05.500]  There are some challenges to using hemp
[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.140]  in the automotive industry.
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:09.820]  Like Ford Motor as an example,
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:12.220]  they do something called a soak test.
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:14.500]  They will take any kind of material
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:17.260]  they have to put it into a car.
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:20.140]  Car companies, they take their stuff serious.
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:23.420]  They don't wanna have stuff coming back at them.
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:27.300]  So, they'll take a body cam and stick it
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:30.580]  into a vat of water for X amount of days
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:32.620]  and see if it affects it.
[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:40.100]  Hemp, being plant material, sucks in water.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.780]  So, if you don't seal that really, really well,
[01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.620]  it can swell up, et cetera.
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:50.620]  It's called being hydrophilic, means it attracts water.
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:54.700]  Carbon fiber, steel, and fiberglass,
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.660]  those are all hydrophobic.
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:58.420]  They don't attract water.
[01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:02.580]  So, in Ford's mind, and Chevy, and everybody else,
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:04.740]  they don't wanna have any problems with,
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:06.780]  if it's too humid or this sort of thing.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:09.500]  I personally haven't found that kind of an issue
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.100]  in making these cars.
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:12.700]  You coat them really, really well,
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.260]  and you're in good shape.
[01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:15.740]  You're gonna have just as many problems
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.300]  with rust from steel, in my opinion.
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.340]  If you don't coat steel, what happens?
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:24.460]  Especially, you're down in Florida, right?
[01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:25.300]  Yeah.
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.860]  Yeah, so I mean, I feel like that's where
[01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:29.260]  a lot of the rust and stuff, those cars come from.
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:31.180]  Yeah, so I mean, there are trade-offs
[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:33.980]  for any kind of material, et cetera.
[01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:38.420]  But I think that those kind of issues are easily addressed.
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:43.420]  And so, quite frankly, I don't imagine in 20 years
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:46.780]  that there will still be steel body cars.
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:50.900]  It's just, it's irresponsible, quite frankly.
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:54.020]  And you know, a lot of corporations now
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:58.340]  are really starting to take a look at embodied carbon
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:00.780]  as an important aspect,
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:05.780]  because that makes their stewardship of the planet.
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:07.740]  It's very important.
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:11.380]  According to Accenture, which is a consulting company,
[01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:12.780]  used to be Arthur Anderson,
[01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:18.820]  they say that 82% of consumers would prefer to buy
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.860]  a product that's good for the planet
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:23.300]  if it's roughly the same price.
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:26.460]  So consumers want to see that sort of thing.
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:29.620]  When you see hemp-bodied cars, then you will.
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:30.740]  Yeah, sure.
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:33.340]  That's gonna make, that's gonna differentiate.
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:37.140]  Right now, if it's an electric car,
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:38.980]  you're gonna get the press.
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:41.260]  Ask Elon Musk, he'll tell you that.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:43.620]  And now, Ford's doing it,
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:45.460]  all the rest of the companies are all doing it,
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:47.260]  they're all gonna go electric.
[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:48.580]  Sooner or later, somebody's gonna say,
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:51.580]  hey, Bruce, we wanna build our bodies out of hemp.
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:53.500]  Right now, it costs a whole lot more,
[01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.420]  it's ridiculous, the market's gonna do
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:57.140]  very limited production.
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:02.140]  But as soon as this gets adopted by a major company,
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:07.140]  the technology, and already Nissan's working on a way
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:12.060]  to make car body panels out of carbon fiber,
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:16.340]  and they've cut the cycle time down by 80%.
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:17.180]  And that used to be the big thing.
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.500]  That cost for that carbon fiber's gotta be wrong.
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.260]  Yeah, the carbon fiber is extremely expensive.
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:27.500]  It's like five times what this hemp material,
[01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.740]  or what fiberglass.
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:32.420]  This hemp material's around the same price as fiberglass.
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:37.140]  Well, carbon fiber is ridiculously expensive.
[01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:40.740]  And so, if you had to use maybe 25% more hemp
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:43.500]  in order to get the job done in carbon fiber,
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:47.180]  but it costs 1 5th to the hemp,
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.180]  it's pretty much a no-brainer from an economic standpoint.
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.860]  But from an embodied carbon standpoint,
[01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:56.700]  in terms of a stewardship for the earth standpoint,
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.900]  in terms of having a good reputation
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:01.300]  as a corporation that cares about the planet,
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:02.780]  you definitely wanna be making everything
[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:03.620]  that possible with hemp.
[01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:04.900]  Hemp is the future.
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:05.740]  Absolutely.
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:10.740]  And this was all predicted in 1985, Jack.
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:13.180]  1985, Jack Carroll.
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:14.100]  Show that up for later.
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:15.140]  Yeah.
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:18.060]  There's something in here,
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:20.460]  this is at the end of chapter two.
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:23.820]  And the reason why I bring this along
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.300]  is not because I'm a believer,
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:29.020]  but I just happened to be approached by Jack's son
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:31.020]  about a little over a year ago.
[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:33.180]  I think I just saw him upstairs.
[01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:34.020]  Yeah, he's here.
[01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:36.420]  Little over a year ago.
[01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:40.700]  And he said, Bruce, he used to be in the computer industry,
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.820]  maybe he could help us republish his book.
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:46.620]  It's been out of publication since Jack died in 2010,
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:49.140]  or a little after that.
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:54.140]  But in 1992, this part was added to the book.
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:57.580]  The book was originally published in 1985
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:59.300]  when he was saying to hemp,
[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:00.580]  he was saying, I'm not telling you
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:01.900]  that hemp can save the planet,
[01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:03.580]  but it's the only thing that can.
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:07.540]  Jack was pretty rambunctious about his statements.
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:09.780]  People probably thought he was nuts.
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:10.940]  But he was right.
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:13.540]  It may not be the only thing that can,
[01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.420]  but it's probably the most important thing
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:18.780]  that we can do right now is to embrace hemp
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:19.900]  to save the planet.
[01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:22.500]  This article here at the end of chapter two
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:27.380]  is about he and his assistant,
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:30.780]  they approached the guy at the USDA
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:34.020]  whose responsibility was addressing this thing
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:37.660]  called global warming, 1992.
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:39.700]  This was added in past,
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.980]  beyond the first edition of the book.
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:45.220]  And he came to them and said,
[01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:46.780]  if there was a material,
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:48.980]  if there were a material that you could use
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:51.660]  to help things out,
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:55.060]  maybe you should consider it.
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:56.500]  What do you guys wanna do?
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:59.580]  He says, well, we know that we have to stop
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:00.780]  burning fossil fuels,
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.940]  and it would be nice if we didn't have to cut down
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:04.540]  all these trees, all of a sudden.
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.620]  He said, well, what if you try hemp?
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:13.060]  And so Jack told this guy at the USDA
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.900]  what numbers he had pulled together,
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:19.740]  and the guy at the USDA says,
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:21.460]  well, gosh, I would have never thought about it.
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:23.540]  This is really, really incredible.
[01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.340]  Thank you for bringing this forward.
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:26.540]  And then he paused and says,
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:28.220]  oh, but there's just one problem.
[01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:30.780]  And Jack's sitting there going like,
[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:32.460]  yay, I just saved the world.
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:34.900]  I've got the US government on my side now.
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:37.540]  And the guy says, turns to him and says,
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:41.860]  well, you know hemp is cannabis, don't you?
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:45.020]  He says, of course, I've been writing about this stuff
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.260]  since 1985.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.180]  Of course I know hemp is cannabis.
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:51.460]  Well, you know cannabis is illegal, right?
[01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:53.220]  He says, yeah, I know.
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:55.020]  He says, well, then we can't use it.
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:56.860]  He says, even if you wanna save the planet?
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:59.140]  He says, even if you wanna save the planet.
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:01.460]  This is the discussion that Jack Herro had
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:04.380]  with the US government in 1992.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:07.660]  So Jack knew all the stuff that I'm talking about today
[01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:10.540]  all the way back then, all the way as early as 1985
[01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.700]  when he first published his book.
[01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:14.260]  He's definitely a pioneer.
[01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:16.060]  A lot of us call that an OG.
[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:18.820]  Somebody that's definitely like a mentor.
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:21.100]  He is the OG.
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:25.620]  One of the OGs of the OG in the cannabis hemp space.
[01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:29.620]  He was more into hemp than he was into marijuana.
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:33.060]  But this book talks about the whole history.
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:38.060]  And so, it was my inspiration.
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:39.700]  I hope it inspires other people.
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:41.140]  I hope they pick up a copy of the book.
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:43.860]  There's an ebook version of this book as well.
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:46.980]  And Dan and I worked on that.
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:50.700]  And we've got like hundreds of additional stories
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:55.700]  about hemp, what's happened since Jack passed away in 2010.
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:25:00.700]  And so we decided we wanted to keep the book
[01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:02.340]  completely original.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:05.860]  So when you get, this is just for the ebook version.
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:08.420]  If you buy the ebook, which is only 10 bucks,
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:10.060]  you get black and white,
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:13.900]  you've got all of his original words and references,
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.860]  complete references, hyperlinks,
[01:25:15.860 --> 01:25:18.300]  to the materials that we can still discover.
[01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:20.780]  Which is amazing that he chronicled what he did
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:22.780]  because a lot of it's still in the book.
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:24.620]  It's amazing that he chronicled what he did
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:27.660]  because a lot of it's still not, no longer available.
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:29.540]  But then we added hundreds of other links
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:32.500]  to other stories and videos, et cetera.
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:35.700]  So you can be reading the ebook and say,
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:38.900]  I wanna see a video of what that's talking about.
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:41.060]  Where can our viewers get the ebook?
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:42.180]  On Amazon.
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.140]  Okay.
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:46.620]  Also, if you just wanna make a quick click,
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:52.140]  go to jackhererfoundation.org
[01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:53.820]  and you'll see a big thing about the book.
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:56.060]  Just click on that and it'll bring you to it.
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:01.940]  There are all sorts of old copies
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:04.580]  of the book that you can buy online.
[01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:07.380]  But this is the most cost-effective way to do it.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:09.660]  And it's the latest edition.
[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:11.100]  The greenest way to do it as well, right?
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:12.140]  The greenest way to do it,
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:13.780]  if you wanted to get the ebook.
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:17.300]  You can get the 14th edition, that's what this is here.
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:22.420]  And this now includes all his original research.
[01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:25.020]  Wow.
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:25.860]  Once again.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.180]  Yeah, you can show that to everybody.
[01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:29.540]  Yeah, all these individual articles.
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:31.540]  There's one with Henry Ford right there.
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.500]  Fiddling around with his hemp car.
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.940]  But it's, I mean, it's amazing.
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:39.220]  There's so many people, Brian,
[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:41.900]  that are going into the cannabis industry right now
[01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:43.380]  that don't know the history.
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:44.220]  Not at all, yeah.
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:45.460]  A lot of people don't.
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:46.300]  You know?
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:48.620]  Some of them don't even seem to care.
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.060]  Yeah, and you know, it's...
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:55.340]  I'm not gonna disagree.
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:57.260]  But, you know, it's really important
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:26:58.940]  to take a look at the background
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:00.740]  behind all this stuff and why it is.
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:04.620]  There's a whole chapter in this book
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:09.300]  about the origins of religion
[01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:11.340]  and how cannabis was involved
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:13.780]  with a lot of the origins of religion.
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:16.500]  That's gonna blow away your family priest.
[01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:20.580]  Some of the stuff that they talk about,
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:22.740]  cannabis and it was...
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:23.820]  Have you ever heard of cannabis?
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:25.500]  Yeah, I studied theology for a little while.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.780]  Yeah, you knew some of that.
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:31.580]  All the old priests and rabbis and this sort of stuff
[01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.780]  with the incense and stuff like that.
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:35.780]  Or even the Native Americans with the peace pipe.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:36.980]  They were happy guys.
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:37.820]  Yeah.
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:38.660]  They were happy guys.
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:39.580]  Laid back, like we are.
[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:41.180]  Chapter seven.
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:42.900]  Chapter seven in this book
[01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:46.180]  is all about medicinal uses for cannabis.
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:49.860]  And as you know, so much has gone on
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:53.540]  in the last 10 years with medical cannabis, right?
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:54.620]  Absolutely.
[01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:58.380]  So we added literally, oh,
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:00.380]  at least 100 new
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:06.100]  actual testimonies from people
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:10.460]  whose they owe their lives to medical cannabis.
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:11.660]  So that's really cool.
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:14.820]  Chapter seven is now twice as big in Hebrew
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:15.740]  than the original.
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:18.620]  When Jack did his research,
[01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:20.340]  it blew people's mind.
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:21.540]  Epilepsy?
[01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:22.380]  Yeah.
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:24.220]  You can use CBD and that'll handle epilepsy.
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:27.220]  My son for a while was suffering from febrile seizures,
[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:29.620]  grandma febrile seizures, where you have a seizure.
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:30.460]  Big difference, right?
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:32.180]  And CBD, yeah.
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.340]  Especially when you can just rub it
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:34.780]  on the bottom of their foot.
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:36.700]  I feel like a lot of people don't know,
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:40.420]  still to this day don't know that CBD can stop seizures
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:43.780]  almost instantly when it's added as a topical.
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.780]  Transdermal topical.
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:47.620]  Yeah.
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.220]  So what's the future for you, Bruce?
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:50.220]  I know you're down in Florida.
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:52.460]  I know that, to be honest with you,
[01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:53.900]  in my world back in the day,
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:56.380]  a lot of the awesome genetics that we were getting
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:57.940]  were coming from Florida.
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:28:58.780]  But-
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:28:59.620]  Oh, really?
[01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:00.460]  Yeah.
[01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:01.300]  I mean, there's even this stuff called Krippi.
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:02.620]  I don't know if you're familiar with that.
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:03.460]  No.
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:05.580]  Yeah, but that's tried and true from Florida.
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:09.180]  And a lot of the underground, old OG type individuals,
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:10.460]  we love to grow that stuff.
[01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:13.660]  You guys had something that was extremely unique.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:17.020]  But I know that down in Florida, basically federally,
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:19.180]  you guys aren't really able to do too much.
[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:22.780]  So where do you think the focus is for Florida?
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:26.400]  Well, I'll tell you about Florida first,
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.340]  and then tell you what we're doing.
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:29.180]  Okay.
[01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:30.020]  Max?
[01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:30.840]  Yeah.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.020]  Florida is coming along.
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:35.540]  Florida is not one of the most progressive states.
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:37.500]  But we're seeing some of these other states
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:39.820]  that you never thought, oh my God.
[01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:40.780]  Oklahoma.
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:42.260]  Oklahoma, you know.
[01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:44.060]  It's just amazing.
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:45.940]  One of the Dakotas, one of those big-
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:47.100]  South Dakota, right?
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:47.940]  Yeah, South Dakota.
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.820]  South Dakota just went, it's amazing.
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:52.660]  But-
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:54.020]  If you didn't want to.
[01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:59.020]  In Florida, we have a commissioner of agriculture,
[01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:02.220]  Nikki Pree, that's her name.
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:06.980]  And then a czar of cannabis, Holly Bell.
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:09.460]  And they are very pro-cannabis.
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:13.100]  And they are pushing things along as well as they can.
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.060]  And they're doing a heck of a good job.
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:20.860]  And hemp for fiber is gonna be huge.
[01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:23.140]  It's just starting out right now.
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:25.340]  So that's my main focus.
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:29.380]  I don't really concern myself with THC or CBD, et cetera.
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:33.260]  My focus is 100% on this.
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:38.700]  This is how do we get rid of steel, aluminum, fiberglass,
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:40.340]  and carbon fiber?
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:43.500]  Even if you have to use three times more hemp
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:46.860]  to replace a steel beam, that's okay.
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:49.140]  Because you're taking CO2 out of the atmosphere
[01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:50.820]  and you're not dumping it in.
[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:55.580]  So my focus is how can we grow the very finest,
[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:59.980]  highest tensile strength hemp fiber
[01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:04.300]  and turn it into durable and recyclable goods?
[01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:07.260]  Because if it's durable or recyclable,
[01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:09.940]  it does not go back into the atmosphere.
[01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:14.580]  And as many of your viewers may not be aware,
[01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:16.940]  a lot of people run around and say,
[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:20.340]  hemp is biodegradable, which is good
[01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:23.620]  if you throw all your stuff into the garbage.
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:28.620]  But if you start thinking like we have to think,
[01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:31.820]  you don't wanna throw anything into the garbage.
[01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:36.580]  Because if it decomposes, where does that CO2 go to?
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:38.220]  It goes back in the atmosphere.
[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:41.220]  If you burn it, it goes back in the atmosphere faster.
[01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:43.340]  It's called oxidation.
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:45.420]  It's decomposing those materials
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:48.380]  and when they decompose, the carbon bonds
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:53.300]  to the oxygen molecule or atoms and it goes back again.
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:58.020]  So my focus here in, or now, Florida,
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:00.380]  now that we just finished this first production,
[01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:02.060]  first limited production car,
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:05.980]  is 100% focused on something we call carbon negative fiber.
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:08.180]  That's the new name for the company.
[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:12.940]  And we're developing what we hope to be materials
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:15.940]  that any company can use.
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:19.060]  Any company that used to use fiberglass,
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:23.020]  carbon fiber, steel or aluminum.
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:27.260]  So one of the big ones is gonna be the marine industry.
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:29.620]  Boats, right?
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:32.500]  It's almost a one-to-one replacement
[01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:35.500]  in terms of volume and weight.
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:38.460]  They're very similar in a lot of those respects.
[01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:42.220]  So instead of using fiberglass,
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:46.380]  which I believe dumps, it's either eight tons or 12 tons,
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:49.860]  I don't have my notes, of CO2 in the atmosphere
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:51.100]  for every ton you use.
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.540]  Instead of that, you can be taking two tons
[01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:55.580]  out of the atmosphere.
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:58.780]  So you're avoiding eight to 10, eight to 12,
[01:32:58.780 --> 01:33:02.580]  and you're also taking another two out.
[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:05.900]  So you have a net difference of somewhere between 10,
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:09.060]  10 to 14 tons of CO2, right?
[01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:09.900]  So-
[01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:10.740]  So it'd be a better boat, right?
[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:13.100]  Yeah, so I've got one major brand
[01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:16.060]  that has already decided they're gonna use my materials.
[01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:18.540]  Just looking at the old bi-directional stuff
[01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:19.380]  that we were making,
[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:21.060]  now we're going with the unidirectional,
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:24.140]  which will help drop the weight even better.
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:24.980]  And they've already decided
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:27.340]  they're gonna use this material, I can't even name the name.
[01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:30.220]  But they've also decided that they're gonna go
[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:32.660]  with the one on electric boats too.
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:36.060]  So they're ditching the petroleum fuel,
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:37.340]  they're going electric,
[01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:39.500]  and they're gonna get rid of their fiberglass
[01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:41.540]  and they're gonna use hemp instead.
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:43.940]  It's the wave of the future.
[01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:44.780]  It is.
[01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:46.020]  I feel like you're one of the pioneers, buddy.
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:48.020]  I mean, I've been walking around up there
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:49.620]  and everybody's talking about your booth,
[01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:50.940]  talking about your car.
[01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:54.380]  I feel like it just has this real beauty to it.
[01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:57.180]  Well, the hemp community is so,
[01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:00.780]  there are so many great things that are going on.
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:04.500]  I met earlier today with Clem Kyle,
[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:07.420]  who's the CEO of Hemp Plastics.
[01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:09.900]  And I'm hoping to meet up with Greg Wilson.
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:11.220]  If you get a chance to interview him,
[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:13.260]  that'd probably be good, both those guys.
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:18.260]  But we all have complementary products
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:21.500]  that we're, materials that we're developing, right?
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.100]  And we don't step on each other's toes.
[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.860]  So we're, Glenn and I are talking about
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:30.860]  how we pull together a hemp CO2 consortium, right?
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:36.380]  And if you start adding up all the different things
[01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:39.980]  that we can do and make out of hemp,
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:42.580]  there is no question in my mind
[01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:46.820]  that there is no other technology that even comes close
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:49.740]  for helping to mitigate the climate crisis.
[01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:53.700]  Elon Musk, like a couple of months ago,
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:56.620]  or six weeks ago, I'm not sure,
[01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:57.660]  came out with this challenge.
[01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:58.500]  I saw that.
[01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.260]  He's gonna give $100 million to whoever comes up
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:03.800]  with the greatest carbon reduction technology.
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:06.680]  Excellent, great job.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:09.700]  We were joking in the cannabis community.
[01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:10.980]  All right, we all figured it out.
[01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:12.420]  It's called trees.
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:13.820]  And I know, I've seen those.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:15.420]  I've seen those posts.
[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:19.380]  And I was gonna be a smart ass and respond and say,
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.620]  you guys haven't read the book, have you?
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:22.980]  It's called Bulletin.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:24.860]  It's called Bulletin 404.
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:29.860]  It came out in 1914 from the USDA
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:33.340]  that hemp grows four times faster than trees.
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:35.980]  So why would you ever plant a tree?
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:40.180]  So, you know, a lot of the folks
[01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:43.980]  that are all about reforestation say,
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:46.180]  the fastest way is to plant trees.
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:48.180]  Hello, Elon, send me my $100 million.
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:52.940]  But as hempsters know, seriously,
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:56.100]  if you plant a tree, it's gonna sit there
[01:35:56.100 --> 01:36:00.220]  in a forest for 20 years, slowly absorbing CO2.
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:04.460]  Or you can cultivate hemp, and in some places like Florida,
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:06.460]  get up to four crops per year,
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:09.500]  and it's gonna be sucking CO2 out of the atmosphere
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:10.860]  four times faster.
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:13.180]  As well as improving the soil system as well.
[01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:15.700]  Yes, exactly, yeah.
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:18.420]  So we have a lot of places that have been deforested,
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:23.420]  et cetera, and pretty quickly,
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:26.140]  a lot of places, say these rainforests,
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:28.620]  the soils degrade very rapidly,
[01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:32.620]  and hemp could potentially regenerate some of those soils.
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:35.780]  Or it could be planted in a lot of the places
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:38.500]  where mining, strip mining is gonna happen,
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.900]  happen for mining, et cetera.
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:45.860]  Here's another thing that just blows my mind.
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:50.860]  I recently saw a documentary about how bad livestock,
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:58.180]  raising livestock is for the planet.
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:01.500]  I mean, I can't remember the name of it was.
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.780]  Just trying to feed all the animals.
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:06.220]  It's mainly cattle.
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:10.860]  Just the amount of water that they consume,
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.660]  and the amount of pasture, et cetera.
[01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:18.540]  But it's one of the primary reasons
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:20.660]  for deforestation right now.
[01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:25.380]  So imagine this, if all of a sudden
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:30.380]  we could make hempcrete homes 22 stories tall
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:35.980]  with compressed wood from Greg Wilson and hempwood, right?
[01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:39.980]  Imagine if we could replace 50% of all steel,
[01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:41.660]  aluminum fiber, glass and carbon fiber
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:44.500]  for using carbon negative fiber instead of hemp.
[01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:48.140]  And then we're starting,
[01:37:49.060 --> 01:37:52.300]  and now the hempcrete that we would be putting
[01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:54.700]  into these tall structures,
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:57.740]  because now hemp can hold them up instead of steel,
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:37:59.540]  instead of wood, right?
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:02.300]  So we're using a whole lot more hempcrete.
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:03.780]  I mean, we're going in the right direction.
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:08.780]  And now as well, if we're growing hemp for that fiber,
[01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:13.180]  that's used, and also for the seed, right?
[01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:15.660]  Which could be made into hamburgers, right?
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:17.140]  And feed poor people.
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:19.500]  I mean, that's the reason for a lot of deforestation
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:22.220]  is subsistence of subsistence living.
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:25.820]  People cut down trees in Brazil
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:27.620]  just to be able to raise a couple of pigs,
[01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:29.900]  maybe a lot of people have them, right?
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:31.580]  But if they can get their protein
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:33.020]  from a better source of protein,
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:34.540]  which we all know is hemp seed.
[01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:35.380]  A hundred percent.
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:36.460]  Exactly.
[01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:37.420]  It's a beautiful thing.
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:40.460]  So now we're talking about making,
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:45.500]  from going from where reforestation could potentially
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.700]  affect about five gigatons per year
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.340]  if it was done really seriously.
[01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:52.700]  We're talking now to get into the neighborhood of twice that
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:56.620]  simply by growing hemp to address,
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:58.520]  you know, replacing a lot of concrete.
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:03.340]  Again, I'm sure you've explained to some of your guests,
[01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:06.300]  to your guests or to your audience,
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:07.900]  you've had people talking about hemp green.
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:09.980]  It's not the same as concrete.
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:11.420]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:13.180]  We plan to talk about that more.
[01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:15.260]  All of our viewers, so you know, Bruce,
[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:16.380]  we're living soil.
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:18.140]  We believe that we're, you know,
[01:39:18.140 --> 01:39:21.260]  we're going out of our way to use the microbial life
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:24.380]  to produce cannabis and hemp instead of synthetic.
[01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:27.180]  So we're really big on everything that you're about.
[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:31.980]  Our viewers are just hardened and passionate about.
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:32.820]  It's the plant.
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:34.860]  I mean, Future Cannabis Project,
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:36.460]  that's hosted by Peter here.
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:38.540]  He's the owner of Future Cannabis Project.
[01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:40.140]  He goes out of his way.
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:41.660]  You should see this guy as an animal
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:43.420]  with the amount of free education
[01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:46.180]  that he's putting out there for the viewership.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:48.500]  And again, it's all coming back to more of a
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:50.340]  beyond organic living soil,
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:53.100]  like for lack of a better term,
[01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:54.940]  we call that Korean natural farming,
[01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:56.940]  even though it was created in Japan.
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:58.300]  So a lot of us are trying to change that
[01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:01.140]  into like modern natural farming or natural farming,
[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:02.700]  but that's getting back to the basics,
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:05.460]  using plants to create cannabis,
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:08.660]  using aloe vera to clone instead of using synthetic.
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:12.660]  So all of our viewers are really big into saving the planet.
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:16.700]  The earth is just as important as for us
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:18.700]  as it should be for our future children.
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:20.420]  Yeah.
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:21.860]  Hemp is the answer.
[01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:22.700]  Yes sir.
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:24.540]  Can you guys hear me by the way?
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:25.420]  We can.
[01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:26.260]  Now we can.
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:27.100]  Oh my God.
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:27.940]  All right.
[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:29.660]  So just some curiosity questions.
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:34.660]  A lot of the hemp seed breeding and production
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:39.540]  is geared towards extraction of high CBD.
[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:43.180]  So can you talk about what you'd like to see in the market
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:47.140]  for people breeding towards your needs of like fiber
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:49.580]  and tensile strength and things like that
[01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:50.740]  and where we are today
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:53.500]  and who's doing some interesting breeding
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:57.420]  or who needs to step up for other hemp uses
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:00.100]  besides extraction?
[01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:01.140]  Is that Peter?
[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:01.980]  That is Peter.
[01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:04.420]  The secret voice that's coming through these headphones?
[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:05.260]  Yeah.
[01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:06.620]  Peter, you wanna put your face up?
[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:08.180]  Hey Peter.
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:09.020]  That's him.
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:10.500]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:11.340]  Sure.
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:12.900]  I'll comment on that.
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:16.260]  Here at the show, we're hoping to run into more people
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:18.180]  that are focused on fiber.
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:19.020]  Absolutely.
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:24.820]  Last time I was at this show was two years ago
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:29.220]  and it was just CBD, CBD.
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:30.420]  Kind of like-
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:32.140]  That was the hot word that year.
[01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:32.980]  Who are you?
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:34.740]  You made a car out of hemp fiber?
[01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:41.100]  But right now I think that the fiber thing,
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:43.980]  the message really starting to really stick strong.
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:50.140]  So we are looking, I am looking for the best cultivars
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:56.100]  for fiber, which will give us the highest strength fiber.
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:41:59.820]  Are there any brands that you feel like-
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:04.140]  I can't say that I recommend anything right now.
[01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:09.140]  In building the prototype
[01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:11.020]  and then the first limited production car,
[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:12.940]  we use commercial off the shelf stuff.
[01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:19.340]  And so some of it was from Enviro Textiles,
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:23.420]  Barbara and Summer in Colorado.
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:25.260]  Some of it was from Lawrence Serbin
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:29.580]  in Southern California, Hemp Traders.
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:31.740]  And some of it was from China.
[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:34.900]  So all good suppliers.
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:37.820]  But as we go forward, we know just from studies
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:40.100]  that have been done by scientists
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:45.100]  that the smaller diameter of the hemp fiber,
[01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:49.500]  the stronger it is.
[01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:52.780]  So I've had probably a hundred different people contact me
[01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:57.460]  saying, move your car manufacturing facility to our state
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:42:58.300]  because we're gonna grow hemp
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:00.860]  and we want to make the hemp fiber.
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:03.020]  And I said, well, what are you guys doing now?
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:03.860]  They say CBD.
[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:05.860]  I say, it's not good.
[01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:09.300]  If you want to get really, really high quality fiber
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:11.780]  for this type of application
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:14.940]  to replace structural materials,
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:17.460]  you want to grow specifically for fiber
[01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:21.340]  and you really want to use the male part of the plant.
[01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:23.500]  So here, everybody else is running around.
[01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:24.340]  Yeah, we love the females.
[01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:25.900]  All we want is females.
[01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:28.340]  I'm going like, what the hell do you do with females?
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:29.180]  So-
[01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:31.700]  The male fiber from the plant
[01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:34.620]  is significantly stronger than the female.
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:38.500]  The male fiber at just at the point of pollination
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:41.980]  is its optimum strength.
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:44.780]  So what we're gonna discover is probably
[01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:48.340]  some optimal cultivars over this next coming year.
[01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:52.820]  We are currently looking for capital
[01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:54.500]  to raise a little bit of capital
[01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:57.420]  to do an R&D facility in Fort Lauderdale.
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:03.060]  And we'll be experimenting with those different things.
[01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:05.740]  So we'll know more next year.
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:07.020]  Let's do this again next year.
[01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:09.380]  Absolutely, we plan to do this every year
[01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:12.700]  as long as Mr. Polis lets us have events like this.
[01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:13.780]  Yeah, this is great.
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:14.700]  Yeah, awesome.
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:16.460]  Well, we appreciate your time.
[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:17.300]  I know you're up there.
[01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:18.580]  He's got one of the most popular booths up there.
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:20.620]  So for him to spend this much time with us,
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:22.220]  we really appreciate it.
[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:23.380]  If you guys are coming down,
[01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:25.660]  I know a lot of you are coming tomorrow.
[01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:26.500]  Check him out.
[01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:28.020]  I think it's 200A is your booth.
[01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:29.180]  Is that correct?
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:30.340]  Check him out, 200A.
[01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:32.580]  He's got a beautiful, beautiful booth
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:34.620]  with an unbelievable car.
[01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:36.780]  We'll talk to you guys here again shortly.
[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:38.140]  Thanks, Brian.
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:39.220]  Thanks again, Peter.
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:43.000]  Thank you.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.080]  Sorry, I forgot you guys can hear me now.
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.480]  Before, you guys couldn't hear me.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:49.840]  But I know that was awesome.
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:53.880]  So I can get a interview with Hempwood as well.
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.400]  So we'll try to make that happen.
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:58.920]  Yeah, I emailed Greg Wilson's company
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:01.160]  just to say we're in the basement level
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:03.000]  doing interviews if he wants to come down.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.760]  But yeah, if you guys see him, grab him.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.000]  Okay, I think I know where he's at.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:08.840]  I can go grab him.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:11.760]  And Glenn Kyle from Hemp Plastics would be good.
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:13.040]  Glenn Kyle, all right.
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:16.600]  Also one of the principals for the original principal
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:20.440]  is Paul Bennett as well.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.400]  You guys know Paul.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:23.520]  I've heard that name, I don't know him.
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:25.600]  He's one of the original OGs.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:26.880]  Australian guy.
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.280]  First guy to make a Frisbee out of hemp
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:34.680]  and the first one to make a snack out of hemp seeds.
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:36.040]  I've never met him.
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:38.160]  How do you spell Glenn's last name?
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:41.680]  I believe it's K-Y-L-L.
[01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:44.000]  I got it.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:48.680]  K-A-Y-L-L, yeah.
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:51.280]  Okay, and there's another guy you guys need to interview too
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:52.120]  who's gonna be here.
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:54.440]  I just found out he's gonna be.
[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:59.440]  I lent him my first hemp car a couple years ago at EarthX.
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:04.680]  And as you know, EarthX is the biggest earth show
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:06.360]  on the planet.
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:09.440]  It's like the NOCO of everything.
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:10.600]  Yeah.
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:13.480]  And his name is Trammell Pro.
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:15.720]  Super guy.
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:19.720]  You will love him.
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:21.640]  He's a total character.
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:24.280]  And every year he throws a couple million dollars
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:29.280]  into EarthX as his way to make a pet project.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:32.280]  Well, the guy's a super guy.
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:34.520]  When I first met him,
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:39.800]  I brought the car out to Dallas
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:44.800]  and the guys who sponsored bringing the car out,
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:47.000]  they said, we're gonna go over and meet Trammell
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:48.640]  on his compound.
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.760]  Trammell's got a little money.
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:53.880]  Yeah, yeah, anytime you use the word compound,
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:55.040]  it kind of gets handed to you.
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:58.920]  And so we ended up, he said,
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.840]  let me just use your car for a week.
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:03.200]  So I left him the car.
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:04.640]  Trammell's car was, you know.
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:05.480]  Yeah, hey.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:07.360]  Joe Biden wants to borrow my car for a week.
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:09.040]  Yeah, Joe, no problem.
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:14.960]  So I walk in to Trammell's dining room, right?
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:18.840]  And there's the head of the,
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.440]  chief scientist for the International Panel
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:23.040]  on Climate Crisis.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.960]  And Buzz Aldrin, wow.
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:32.080]  And, you know, two heavy hitter guys.
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:34.720]  And they're almost going fist to cuffs
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:36.960]  because Buzz Aldrin's saying there's no such thing
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:38.080]  as climate change.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.840]  And the head of IPC, he doesn't exactly agree with them.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:43.440]  And here's Trammell, like holding these guys apart,
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:44.960]  arguing.
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:45.960]  And it was just at the end,
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.040]  just before they broke up and started the interviews.
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:51.680]  So that was my first experience with Trammell.
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:52.880]  He's a really cool guy.
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:54.120]  Yeah.
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:56.640]  What a room to be a fly on the wall there, Buzz.
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:59.240]  Yeah, give me your car, and if I run into Trammell,
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:01.040]  I'll ask him if he'll give you a call.
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:01.880]  Okay.
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:02.720]  What a character.
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:03.560]  Yeah.
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:04.400]  What a super guy.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.600]  And he's doing a whole lot to save the planet.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:09.000]  And he got involved with hemp.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  That was first year.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.920]  He had a small hemp pavilion,
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:16.920]  which our prototype was key to.
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:19.320]  And then after that, I got in touch with Morris.
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:23.320]  I said, Morris, you gotta get connected
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:25.440]  with this Trammell pro guy.
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:26.680]  The way your face is lighting up,
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:29.040]  I would definitely love to interview him.
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:30.160]  Yeah, you gotta do it.
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:32.040]  And again, Bruce, you're speaking today.
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:34.800]  That's one of the reasons why we wanted to have you on here.
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:35.680]  Today and tomorrow.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:38.000]  All right, so we're gonna record the one today
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.640]  and tomorrow, I would imagine.
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:42.080]  So what room is that in for the people that,
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:44.600]  I know some of those people will be coming down later today.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.400]  The business.
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:47.760]  You're in the big boy room.
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:48.600]  Is that it?
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:49.440]  With the LED lights and stuff.
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.880]  That's this afternoon at four.
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:52.160]  The business symposium.
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:54.320]  There's a big boy speaker stage,
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:55.760]  and then the little kid stage.
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:57.800]  I think that's what it's called.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:59.840]  Yeah, Bruce is on the big boy stage.
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:01.880]  And then tomorrow is the material stage.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:03.960]  So today at 4.05.
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.560]  4.05 to 4.20.
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.440]  And that's, I assume,
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:13.200]  that that's one of the more stringently kept schedules
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:14.200]  of the day.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.040]  I would imagine.
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:18.240]  Because at 4.20, I think, you know,
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:19.080]  the crowds might-
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:20.200]  We all know what happens then.
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:21.680]  Yeah, who knows?
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:22.640]  We'll see.
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:24.160]  Well, thank you for your time, Bruce.
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:25.000]  Thanks, guys.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.160]  Peter, do you wanna keep this going?
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:29.360]  You want me to run up there and grab some more people?
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:32.840]  I'll just throw some music on while you go.
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:34.040]  That was fun.
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:34.880]  Thank you, Bruce.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:36.040]  Really appreciate it, brother.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:41.040]  I think if everybody can cut us some slack in our-
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:42.680]  Yeah, please cut us some slack.
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:46.000]  We're at a, this is like where all the stock show stuff is.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.840]  So it's extremely spread out.
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.320]  This is where they, you know,
[01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:51.400]  they move cattle through the hallways
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:52.240]  and that kind of thing.
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:54.560]  So let me run upstairs and grab that.
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.600]  Daguerre will sing for you guys here.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:58.280]  Nice.
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:00.840]  I do have a beautiful voice.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:06.160]  So I'm gonna throw some music on for a little bit.
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:11.400]  We'll see where this show goes.
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:12.360]  So hold on.
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:16.080]  You guys let me know when the music, oh, wait.
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:22.560]  Hold on.
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:26.840]  Strong style, I got you, boy.
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:28.400]  Strong style, organic.
[01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:43.060]  Oh, yeah.
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:45.260]  Oh, yeah.
[01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:09.420]  My man.
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:17.420]  We're now on with one, two,
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:19.420]  better pull your screws.
[01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:22.580]  Four, five, let's keep your alarm.
[01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:25.580]  Seven, eight, creation is great.
[01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:27.340]  So don't be too late.
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:32.540]  It's sweet harmonious.
[01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:35.220]  Let's drop the grips.
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:39.420]  Now listen to the music.
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:49.480]  It's sweet harmonious.
[01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:56.220]  I'm not a preacher man.
[01:51:59.860 --> 01:52:02.620]  Remember I'm not a preacher man.
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:04.140]  I'm a teacher man.
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:09.060]  I'm only singing you my songs.
[01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:12.060]  Oh yes, oh yes.
[01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:16.100]  Don't let your glory go to waste.
[01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:18.180]  Oh no, so.
[01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:20.020]  Oh, yeah.
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:23.020]  Be blessed.
[01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:26.860]  Morning times, evening times.
[01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:28.780]  Every minute of the day.
[01:52:30.980 --> 01:52:32.140]  Every time is.
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:35.380]  Let the jam be blessed.
[01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:38.660]  Oh no, no, no.
[01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:42.220]  Don't say there'll be big shots.
[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:44.060]  Better watch that.
[01:52:44.060 --> 01:52:45.660]  Come over right now.
[01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:48.540]  Let the jam be blessed.
[01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:52.580]  Watch that on your mind.
[01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:55.100]  See you carrying a heavy load.
[01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:57.260]  Yeah.
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:01.740]  All right, so I just grabbed Greg Wilson.
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:03.940]  He should be coming over here in a second.
[01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:07.780]  He's the guy that Bruce was just talking about.
[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:08.620]  Nice.
[01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:13.540]  Peter, I wish you could see how fucking big this is, dude.
[01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:14.380]  Oh, I know.
[01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:15.220]  You can't?
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:16.620]  We're hanging out with.
[01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:17.940]  Switch cameras.
[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:21.180]  Give us the cattle loading.
[01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:30.220]  They got us down in the basement, boys.
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:33.020]  Yeah, it's like the dude in the office space
[01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:35.260]  who keeps getting put down into the basement.
[01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:37.460]  So I gotta be, they said it's right over here.
[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:38.300]  Okay.
[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:40.220]  Here's the headphones.
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:44.340]  All right, so for the viewers out there,
[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:46.780]  this is Greg that Bruce was just talking about.
[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:49.780]  You, he was basically singing your praises, buddy.
[01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:51.620]  So if you kind of want to tell the audience
[01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:52.780]  more about your company,
[01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:55.340]  I know that you got a bunch of cool little demonstrations
[01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:57.620]  upstairs with your hemp wood and that kind of stuff.
[01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:59.300]  So you can just tell the viewers
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:00.900]  kind of what you guys are about.
[01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:01.740]  Sweet.
[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:02.860]  Well, hey, thanks for having us.
[01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:05.140]  So our company is Hempwood.
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:07.500]  The actual company name is Fibonacci.
[01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:09.860]  So we're named after the Fibonacci sequence.
[01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:11.140]  And that's because we use that
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:12.700]  in our manufacturing algorithm
[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:14.420]  for a bunch of different products I've worked on
[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:15.580]  for the last 20 years.
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:18.260]  It's actually my compression ratio
[01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:20.220]  for my bamboo products,
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:21.980]  for my hemp products, for the different things.
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:24.140]  So it's all based on an algorithm
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:25.820]  and that's the algorithm of nature.
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:28.500]  That's how we turn fast growing plant fibers
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:30.780]  into replacements for tropical hardwoods
[01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:34.380]  or your kind of higher end old growth forests.
[01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:37.020]  So we do lumber, we do flooring,
[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:39.260]  we do furniture and cabinetry,
[01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:41.140]  stair treads, a lot of things like that.
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:43.980]  It's all interior non-structural.
[01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:45.900]  We can make structural products,
[01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:47.700]  but I've never been able to make money out of that.
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:51.100]  So I'm kind of choosing the low hanging fruit of flooring.
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:52.500]  I already have flooring customers
[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:54.660]  from other businesses and things like that.
[01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:55.820]  It's beautiful by the way.
[01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:56.660]  Oh yeah.
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:57.500]  It's good looking stuff up there.
[01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:59.980]  Oh, it's what everybody wants to put in their own home.
[01:54:59.980 --> 01:55:01.180]  It's not the cheapest thing.
[01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:02.340]  People are gonna put vinyl,
[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:03.220]  they're gonna put stuff
[01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:06.140]  that's actually not healthy for you in rentals.
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:07.900]  But when you think about what you wanna have
[01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:08.740]  in your own home,
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:10.500]  because with the windows closed
[01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:11.820]  and the doors shut,
[01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:15.340]  the VOC emissions that come from people using dirty glues
[01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:16.660]  or using plastics,
[01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:18.940]  that's a lot of what's causing cancer in the world.
[01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:21.860]  And people don't really wanna talk about it,
[01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:22.860]  but at the end of the day,
[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:23.980]  that's what it is,
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:26.900]  is people are using unclean things
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:27.900]  and they're breathing it in
[01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:29.140]  and then they're getting cancer.
[01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:30.420]  So what we're trying to do
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:33.540]  is we're using fast growing hemp stalks.
[01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:35.140]  After they take off the top of the plant
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:37.260]  and they use that for the flower and the seed,
[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:39.500]  then we use the bottom just like wheat straw.
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.500]  It's basically the wheat straw model.
[01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:42.660]  We buy bales of hemp.
[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:45.020]  It all comes from within 100 miles of our plant.
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:47.420]  We pay everybody at the plant living wages.
[01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:50.060]  So when $15 an hour was announced
[01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:51.340]  as being a thing in New York City,
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:53.260]  I was like, yeah, it's our starting rate.
[01:55:53.260 --> 01:55:54.500]  In Murray, Kentucky,
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.100]  you can buy a single family home.
[01:55:57.260 --> 01:55:58.100]  We're also-
[01:55:58.100 --> 01:55:58.940]  Kudos to you guys.
[01:55:58.940 --> 01:55:59.780]  I grew up in Georgia,
[01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:01.180]  so I know a little bit.
[01:56:01.180 --> 01:56:02.580]  My father was from Kentucky.
[01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:05.140]  It's a little bit cheaper to live down there.
[01:56:05.140 --> 01:56:06.100]  So 15 an hour,
[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:08.900]  that's quite a nice little starting wage.
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:10.700]  For sure, you can buy a single family home
[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:13.820]  on a half acre in town for 80 to $100,000.
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:16.540]  So you can buy your own home making our starting wage.
[01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:20.420]  So we're also doing a lot with the adhesives.
[01:56:20.420 --> 01:56:22.620]  So we have no added formaldehyde
[01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:24.180]  in our product whatsoever.
[01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:28.420]  That is becoming the norm in American manufacturing.
[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:30.860]  But all of your imported wood products,
[01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:33.780]  if they're laminated products like plywood or OSB,
[01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:35.540]  they typically have formaldehyde
[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:37.340]  and nobody wants to talk about it.
[01:56:37.340 --> 01:56:41.100]  But you can't set up new facilities in the United States
[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:43.060]  using formaldehyde-based glues
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:45.180]  because of what it does to your employees.
[01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:48.780]  But people kind of hide the fact that phenolic,
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:51.740]  if you get a phenolic resin piece of plywood,
[01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:53.460]  that's phenol formaldehyde.
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:56.220]  That's the way a church ended up saying phenolic.
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:58.220]  But that's what's causing all these problems.
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:00.180]  We use a soy-based adhesive.
[01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:02.780]  So in using a soy-based adhesive in our product,
[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:04.780]  we're, from what I'm being told,
[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:07.180]  and I don't want to, I guess, make it public,
[01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:10.220]  but we're a net carbon negative
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:12.220]  building material manufacturer.
[01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:14.980]  And I'm being told that there's not too many,
[01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:17.300]  if any others, in the States.
[01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:18.940]  That's why, again, Bruce,
[01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:21.820]  that's why I feel like why he was singing praises so much.
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:25.260]  Your company is forward thinking in a lot of ways.
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:28.380]  We try building materials.
[01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:29.420]  Yeah.
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:30.260]  Yeah.
[01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:32.860]  So we use about a thousand acres of that each year.
[01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:35.900]  No one really knows the exact amount of carbon
[01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:38.100]  that gets pulled out in the air per acre.
[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:40.860]  But the reality is I'm hearing five, I'm hearing 10,
[01:57:40.860 --> 01:57:42.380]  I'm hearing 15.
[01:57:42.380 --> 01:57:44.980]  Even if it's five, we're still net carbon negative.
[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:46.780]  Because we take our waste,
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:48.940]  and that's what we use as our energy in the plant.
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:51.740]  So we have 100% hydroelectric.
[01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:53.260]  Where we are, I mean, we're in Tennessee,
[01:57:53.260 --> 01:57:54.580]  where the valley is.
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:57.180]  And so it's all dam water that creates the electric.
[01:57:57.180 --> 01:57:58.260]  So you don't have any coal,
[01:57:58.260 --> 01:58:00.500]  you don't have any of that stuff for our electricity.
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.500]  And then we've replaced our natural gas
[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:05.860]  with our bio-burner that takes our waste from the plant,
[01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:08.460]  and it burns it, transfers the energy via glycol
[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:09.700]  around the facility.
[01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:12.260]  So all of our ovens, dryers, kilns,
[01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:13.860]  and heating up the facility,
[01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:15.460]  which used to be natural gas,
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:17.580]  is now powered by our waste.
[01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:18.900]  Oh, yeah.
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:20.740]  And we burn it to a certain degree,
[01:58:20.740 --> 01:58:22.340]  so we actually get biochar.
[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:24.780]  So instead of that carbon going back out into the air,
[01:58:24.780 --> 01:58:26.220]  we get the biochar that we put back
[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:28.060]  into our hemispheres next year.
[01:58:28.060 --> 01:58:29.620]  Yeah, a lot of our viewers,
[01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:30.740]  I know that you might not know this,
[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:32.740]  but we're all living soil growers.
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:33.580]  Okay.
[01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:34.420]  Biochar is definitely something
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:35.620]  that we add to our system.
[01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:39.180]  The beauty of it is that it's really a small little thing
[01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:40.020]  that you need to add,
[01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:42.060]  and at least for our growing,
[01:58:42.060 --> 01:58:43.860]  our lifetime, it's gonna last forever.
[01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:45.540]  So biochar is definitely something
[01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:47.980]  that I feel like our industry needs to use,
[01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:50.220]  and if it's a byproduct from what you guys are doing,
[01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:53.100]  then hey, that's even a better closed-loop system.
[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:54.020]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:55.380]  I live on an organic farm.
[01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:56.860]  It's just a little hobby farm.
[01:58:57.820 --> 01:59:00.380]  The part that I'm actually in control of and doing
[01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:01.860]  is about 37 acres,
[01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:04.580]  and we've got apples, we've got pears,
[01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:07.780]  we've got berries, we've got a vineyard doing grapes.
[01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:10.820]  We grow mushrooms there, and we have chickens and cows.
[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:14.620]  And then the other side of the farm is actually,
[01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:17.060]  there's about eight dozen head of cattle on it,
[01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:18.980]  but it's all organic, so they're all grass-fed,
[01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:20.900]  and it's not that rough.
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:24.020]  Right directly surrounding us is all row crop,
[01:59:24.020 --> 01:59:27.300]  and you can see whenever the sprayers are out there,
[01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:30.540]  and I love ag, I love the outdoors.
[01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:33.100]  Our company comes from the farm
[01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:34.540]  and the manufacturing side.
[01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:36.580]  We're not hemp people,
[01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:39.140]  although it seems to be the right place, right time,
[01:59:39.140 --> 01:59:42.580]  where hemp is actually, in my opinion, if we do it right,
[01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:45.100]  can become a single-digit percentage
[01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:47.700]  of American agriculture, what's planted everywhere.
[01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:49.860]  Is it 1%? Is it 5%?
[01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:51.580]  That's what the question is.
[01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:54.740]  And if we do it right, we can get it to that 5%.
[01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:58.940]  In our industry, being lumber, hardwoods, and flooring,
[01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:01.860]  it has the possibility to be a single-digit percentage
[02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:05.820]  of the hardwood flooring industry in the United States,
[02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:07.580]  as well as a single-digit percentage
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:11.140]  of the hard lumber industry.
[02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:15.980]  And is that 1% or 5% just depends on how much work we do.
[02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:17.900]  So are you pioneers in this?
[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:19.940]  Do you feel like there's, do you have competition yet,
[02:00:19.940 --> 02:00:21.460]  or are you guys kind of out there?
[02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:22.460]  We don't have any competition.
[02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:23.620]  That's what I thought, yeah.
[02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:26.220]  We have patents and trademarks.
[02:00:26.220 --> 02:00:27.860]  We have a trademark on the word hempwood
[02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:30.420]  for flooring, building materials, and lumber,
[02:00:30.420 --> 02:00:32.780]  and the logo in the United States, Canada,
[02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:34.540]  the EU, and Australia.
[02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:37.260]  And then patents in the same places
[02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:40.660]  on how to make the lumber, how to make the flooring,
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:42.220]  as well as how to make panels.
[02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:45.220]  So I did my homework.
[02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:46.060]  Yeah, brother.
[02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:48.140]  It was invented actually in 2010.
[02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:49.460]  It wasn't legal at the time.
[02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:51.180]  I did it in the nanotech labs
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:53.060]  when I was doing the bamboo stuff,
[02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:54.700]  and we called it Weedwood.
[02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:58.620]  And it was just kind of a joke until the farm bill in 2014,
[02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:00.820]  and I started a company called Timber Technologies
[02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:02.940]  where we were recycling woods from plywood mills
[02:01:02.940 --> 02:01:06.700]  in Poland and in Tasmania and in Ukraine.
[02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:09.580]  And one of the customers from the bamboo company called,
[02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:12.660]  actually one of the biggest flooring companies in the US,
[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:15.180]  called and said, hey, we want you to come in
[02:01:15.180 --> 02:01:17.940]  and do a project for the due diligence
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:20.900]  of whether hemp would make good flooring.
[02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:24.100]  And the answer was yes, it would,
[02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:26.460]  but it wasn't federally legal.
[02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:28.220]  So there are legal teams that know
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:30.140]  that they weren't allowed to touch it.
[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:32.300]  And so that's where I kind of put on my entrepreneur hat
[02:01:32.300 --> 02:01:35.380]  and said, better go figure out how to put a patent on it.
[02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:37.660]  And that's where the idea of hemp would come from.
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:39.740]  Knew it would work in 2010,
[02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:43.020]  then the market started asking for it in 2015.
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:45.700]  And then because they said they couldn't do it,
[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:47.700]  I still had the rights to figure out how to do it
[02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:49.980]  and filed some patents in 2016,
[02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:53.020]  sold my house and built a factory.
[02:01:53.020 --> 02:01:54.220]  Congratulations.
[02:01:54.220 --> 02:01:56.220]  You seem quite the entrepreneur.
[02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:57.180]  This is my eighth company.
[02:01:57.180 --> 02:01:58.060]  Yeah.
[02:01:58.700 --> 02:01:59.540]  That's what I do.
[02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:00.380]  I invent something.
[02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:02.340]  I try to set it up, get it to a point.
[02:02:02.340 --> 02:02:03.820]  And then when it becomes corporatized
[02:02:03.820 --> 02:02:08.060]  or too much red tape, I get out of there.
[02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:09.820]  I usually don't sell it off.
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:12.300]  I keep it so I can fund my next thing.
[02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:14.140]  You'll sell a little bit at a time
[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:16.580]  whenever you got to buy a new press machine.
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:18.980]  And then whenever things are going bad,
[02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:21.900]  you sell off your inventory or sell off your equity
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:22.740]  to fund the next one.
[02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:25.140]  It just kind of goes and goes and goes.
[02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:27.020]  I did that with bamboo.
[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:30.340]  I actually invented the system
[02:02:30.340 --> 02:02:32.620]  that's used in breathalyzers in police departments.
[02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:33.460]  Wow.
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:35.700]  So not the actual breathalyzer system,
[02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:38.980]  but the means of blowing hot air across the fuel cell sensor.
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:41.300]  So you would dry out the residual alcohol value
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:42.460]  from the previous user,
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:45.420]  and you'd get a true zero as your base rating.
[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:47.740]  Then you can test how much people
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:48.780]  have actually had to drink
[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:52.260]  rather than using a software that creates a false zero
[02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:53.940]  that they try to base it off.
[02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:55.420]  That's because a couple of my buddies died
[02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:57.180]  drinking and driving.
[02:02:57.180 --> 02:02:59.420]  One of them was actually a pitcher for the Angels.
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:00.660]  He threw a shutout,
[02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:03.060]  and someone watching the game for him
[02:03:03.060 --> 02:03:04.620]  killed him after the game.
[02:03:04.620 --> 02:03:05.980]  Nick Adenhart, he grew up,
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:08.220]  he was a year younger than my little brother,
[02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:10.500]  so we used to run around playing tag growing up
[02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:12.260]  back in Maryland as a kid.
[02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:15.660]  And when he died in a drinking and driving accident,
[02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:18.140]  someone actually watched him pitch that game.
[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:19.540]  We came up with, I was like,
[02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:21.780]  I gotta do something about it.
[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:23.860]  So all of this stuff is just,
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:27.580]  essentially it has a positive means to it.
[02:03:27.580 --> 02:03:28.540]  A lot of ways to make money,
[02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:29.980]  you might as well do something
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:31.860]  that's good for everybody, I'll do it.
[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:33.060]  We obviously have quite the mind
[02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:34.900]  to be able to see certain situations
[02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:36.660]  and be like, you know what, I can fill that void.
[02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:38.500]  I can find that niche.
[02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:39.340]  Yes and no.
[02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:41.300]  I've had three companies that have failed.
[02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:44.940]  It sucks really bad moving back into your brother's couch.
[02:03:44.940 --> 02:03:47.100]  So it's not all sunshine and rain.
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:48.660]  That's the life of an entrepreneur, baby.
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:50.420]  You have to do that. Exactly.
[02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:53.620]  I've been rich and completely broke
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:55.660]  every decade since I started this thing.
[02:03:57.100 --> 02:03:59.460]  Well, I know you're another one of the speakers
[02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:00.780]  here at NOCO Hemp Expo.
[02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:02.700]  I know that you actually have to go run and do that,
[02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:04.260]  so I don't wanna keep you too long.
[02:04:04.260 --> 02:04:05.460]  We appreciate your time
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:07.380]  and for the viewers and that kind of stuff.
[02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:08.940]  Again, these are the bright minds,
[02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:11.140]  some of the pioneers, if you will,
[02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:13.740]  in the hemp industry that are nationwide.
[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:15.540]  And the reason why they come to Denver, Colorado
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:18.420]  is because this is the largest hemp expo in the country.
[02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:20.100]  This is something that I feel like,
[02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:22.740]  people come from around the country to attend.
[02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:24.420]  And I think in just a few years,
[02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:26.460]  I would imagine more and more people from around the world
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:28.740]  are gonna start to come to Denver, Colorado
[02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:31.660]  to hang out at the NOCO Hemp Expo.
[02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:33.220]  Yeah, well, thanks for having us.
[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:35.820]  And what it needs is it takes a village
[02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:37.380]  to get these things off the ground.
[02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:39.980]  So people that are promoting it and showing it,
[02:04:39.980 --> 02:04:42.300]  and it also needs customers that say,
[02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:44.140]  I want something made in America.
[02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:46.140]  I want something sustainably built
[02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:49.300]  that doesn't have any formaldehyde or any dirty stuff in it.
[02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:50.700]  Put that in your home.
[02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:52.580]  Go to hempwood.com and get ahold of us.
[02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:55.180]  You can buy flooring, you can buy furniture,
[02:04:55.180 --> 02:04:57.420]  you can buy lumber, all these different things.
[02:04:57.420 --> 02:05:00.420]  It needs people to start accepting it.
[02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:02.460]  We're the early manufacturer.
[02:05:02.460 --> 02:05:03.940]  We're kind of the pioneer in making it.
[02:05:03.940 --> 02:05:06.780]  We need the early adapters to buy it.
[02:05:06.780 --> 02:05:08.180]  So go with your dollars.
[02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:10.220]  If you're gonna go out of your way,
[02:05:10.220 --> 02:05:11.780]  choose a hemp product for sure.
[02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:14.020]  Yeah, build out that cannabis shop.
[02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:15.700]  Build out that hemp shop.
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:18.660]  We have a question from the Peanut Gallery.
[02:05:18.660 --> 02:05:19.940]  Go ahead, Peter.
[02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:24.820]  So just generally how kind of biomaterials work in heat?
[02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:30.300]  Can you tell me what you mean by heat?
[02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:34.380]  Like underfloor heating or like sticking it in an oven?
[02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:36.660]  Well, maybe not an oven, but yeah.
[02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:38.820]  Magma seeds, clarify the question.
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:45.500]  Yeah, we'll wait for that question to be clarified.
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:46.340]  But you can see it on the screen, right?
[02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:47.660]  I wonder if it means like a different spans.
[02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:49.060]  Yeah, we can see that.
[02:05:49.060 --> 02:05:50.780]  So as far as heat goes,
[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:53.860]  we use a bio-based binder that is a thermo set.
[02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:56.580]  And so you don't wanna take it over top of that temperature
[02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:57.700]  that we're setting it at.
[02:05:57.700 --> 02:05:59.340]  It's got a two stage system.
[02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:00.780]  First stage is 100 degrees.
[02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:03.180]  The second stage is 265.
[02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:06.420]  So if you don't go over that 100 degrees
[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:08.980]  inside of the product when you're using it, you're good.
[02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:10.940]  If you're gonna try to cook it or bake it or whatever,
[02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:12.900]  it's gonna dry it out just like a piece of wood
[02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:14.580]  when you stick it into an oven.
[02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:16.020]  When you dry out that piece of wood,
[02:06:16.020 --> 02:06:17.700]  you're gonna have what's called checking,
[02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:20.900]  which is little splits or cracks happening.
[02:06:20.900 --> 02:06:22.820]  And so if you're gonna heat it up,
[02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:24.300]  I would say heat it up
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:26.900]  and then put your flooring coating on top of it.
[02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:29.620]  And that way you're covering up all of that dry out
[02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:32.340]  before you put a coating that breaks or splits on it.
[02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:34.380]  We do the same with our flooring
[02:06:34.380 --> 02:06:36.420]  when we sell it into a real dry area,
[02:06:36.420 --> 02:06:38.860]  like the mountains in Colorado.
[02:06:38.860 --> 02:06:41.260]  It's the same with engineered wood floor.
[02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:43.380]  You install a unfinished floor
[02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:46.460]  and that unfinished floor allows it to acclimate
[02:06:46.460 --> 02:06:47.700]  to its new climate.
[02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:49.820]  If it's gonna dry out, it's gonna dry out.
[02:06:49.820 --> 02:06:52.500]  And then you finish it or put a coating on
[02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:55.300]  when it's already kind of got used to its new home
[02:06:55.300 --> 02:06:56.820]  and it doesn't have any problems.
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:59.540]  But if you try to do it with a pre-finished,
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:00.940]  then it could show these little cracks
[02:07:00.940 --> 02:07:02.900]  or fractures on the surface.
[02:07:02.900 --> 02:07:04.060]  Right on.
[02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:04.900]  Tropical climate.
[02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:06.900]  Yeah, the clarification, tropical climate.
[02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:10.380]  So I assume that means kind of heat and humidity.
[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:13.940]  So we have a engineered platform for our flooring,
[02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:16.940]  which works well in a high humid area.
[02:07:16.940 --> 02:07:17.980]  So that works fine.
[02:07:19.420 --> 02:07:22.340]  But the solid product would not be what you wanna do.
[02:07:22.340 --> 02:07:25.900]  So coming from the flooring industry and bamboo industry,
[02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:28.860]  I had to deal with the claims for three years
[02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:31.300]  of the world's largest bamboo company,
[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:32.620]  bamboo flooring company.
[02:07:32.620 --> 02:07:35.140]  So I learned all these things of what not to do.
[02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:37.460]  Like in being in hempwood,
[02:07:37.460 --> 02:07:40.780]  my main job is not to drive growth and revenue.
[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:42.980]  It's to make sure the first man out of the foxhole
[02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:44.620]  doesn't get a bullet in his head.
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:47.260]  So making sure the landmine doesn't go off
[02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:50.100]  with my foot on it right now in its infancy
[02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:53.620]  is more important than trying to go out
[02:07:53.620 --> 02:07:55.540]  and get big contracts everywhere.
[02:07:55.540 --> 02:07:56.780]  It needs the craftsman.
[02:07:56.780 --> 02:08:00.220]  It needs someone who wants to put it into that area
[02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:03.260]  that's more interested in hemp
[02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:05.100]  and more interested in the environment.
[02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:07.100]  So they're willing to work with it
[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:08.820]  because they're excited about being the first one
[02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:10.060]  in their place to do it.
[02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:13.420]  So if somebody's looking to put it into a place
[02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:16.460]  that has high humidity,
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:19.220]  yeah, I would say first buy a small amount,
[02:08:19.220 --> 02:08:21.420]  set it in your home, see what happens
[02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:24.220]  before you go and buy $10,000 worth of hempwood
[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:26.220]  or $5,000 worth of hempwood
[02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:27.940]  and you haven't quite figured it out
[02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:30.420]  or mastered the craft or what it's gonna do.
[02:08:30.420 --> 02:08:31.980]  Because you can always figure out
[02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:36.060]  how to make a living thing work in your home
[02:08:36.060 --> 02:08:37.340]  or in your area,
[02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:40.460]  but it's gonna take a little bit of research.
[02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:43.220]  The one guy's asking about how does it turn on a lathe?
[02:08:44.140 --> 02:08:44.980]  It works very well.
[02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:49.020]  If you go to our YouTube page,
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:50.660]  you can see the videos that we put up
[02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:52.580]  when the guys figured out how to turn it.
[02:08:52.580 --> 02:08:53.940]  What's your YouTube?
[02:08:53.940 --> 02:08:57.140]  Fibonacci, F-I-B-O-N-A-C-C-I.
[02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:02.340]  And so if you go in there, it's important,
[02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:06.220]  don't drill down and expect for making pens.
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:07.460]  Because it's so dense,
[02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:09.580]  it's not gonna kick out that drill dust
[02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:11.180]  or the sawdust that comes out of it.
[02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:13.300]  So you actually put it on your lathe
[02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:17.300]  with a bracket around it and it's spinning the wood
[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:18.700]  and then the drill goes into it.
[02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:19.540]  Oh.
[02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:20.380]  Yeah.
[02:09:20.380 --> 02:09:22.340]  And so it actually is able to extract that dust
[02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:24.060]  so it's not creating too high of a density
[02:09:24.060 --> 02:09:25.860]  to cause it to break or split.
[02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:29.780]  And then the second part is it works better with sanding
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:30.980]  than it does with blades.
[02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:33.700]  So the guys get out their tools and their carbide tips.
[02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:35.300]  The sharper the better,
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:37.460]  but if you really wanted to work on something really small,
[02:09:37.460 --> 02:09:38.300]  like a pen blank,
[02:09:38.300 --> 02:09:40.140]  or you're making like a 16th of an inch thick
[02:09:40.140 --> 02:09:41.380]  piece of hemp wood,
[02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:43.580]  you could stabilize it with cactus juice
[02:09:43.580 --> 02:09:45.300]  and you'd use a sander.
[02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:47.600]  Because when you hit it with a blade,
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:50.540]  our wood has basically a rope.
[02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:51.980]  And having rope in it,
[02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:53.060]  then all of a sudden,
[02:09:53.060 --> 02:09:54.860]  once you hit a piece of rope with a blade,
[02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:56.300]  if that blade's not sharp,
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:57.700]  it's gonna have little pieces of fray
[02:09:57.700 --> 02:09:59.380]  like you saw in the hemp wood up there.
[02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:00.900]  That's the hemp fibers in it.
[02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:04.100]  If it's too dull and tries to pull that out,
[02:10:04.100 --> 02:10:07.460]  then it can cause chipping of the herd to pop out.
[02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:09.700]  So sanding, I guess is the answer.
[02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:11.020]  I got a question for you.
[02:10:11.020 --> 02:10:12.100]  So the stuff you make,
[02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:14.660]  is that gonna be directed toward the cabinet industry?
[02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:19.220]  You're like 100% cabinet that have that kind of purpose?
[02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:21.060]  I have two cabinets in my home.
[02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:22.700]  Can you summarize the question?
[02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:23.940]  Yeah.
[02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:26.140]  So Daguerre was basically asking,
[02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:28.220]  is this gonna be something in the cabinet industry,
[02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:30.260]  something that can kind of take over the cabinet?
[02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:32.100]  That's what I used to do for a living.
[02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:34.060]  And I remember how toxic it was
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:37.220]  for building cabinets, stock cabinets,
[02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:38.500]  building homes.
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:40.380]  All that dust from the formaldehyde
[02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:41.940]  and melamine and all that junk.
[02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:43.060]  From all the silicone.
[02:10:43.060 --> 02:10:44.060]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:47.580]  So absolutely, we make cabinets.
[02:10:47.580 --> 02:10:50.500]  Point blank, we have cabinet kits of standard size
[02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:53.340]  that we flat pack and you can assemble on site.
[02:10:53.340 --> 02:10:56.760]  We also sell to all different types of cabinet companies
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:58.460]  that are making doors and they're making-
[02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:00.540]  Those would all either too,
[02:11:00.540 --> 02:11:03.140]  if you had a cabinet that seemed to go directly
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:06.260]  with mold piece, you're gonna be involved?
[02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:08.020]  People put a lot of different,
[02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:11.020]  they pour epoxies and stuff like that
[02:11:11.020 --> 02:11:12.260]  and they're doing countertops.
[02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:13.620]  So I've seen people starting to do
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:16.460]  like river tables out of hempwood.
[02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:17.540]  Pretty neat.
[02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:19.180]  So there's all these different things
[02:11:19.180 --> 02:11:21.380]  that that's why it still needs to be
[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:23.300]  that kind of small niche market,
[02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:26.060]  getting into all these little nooks and crannies
[02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:29.700]  of the industry where someone wants to make it work.
[02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:32.940]  When people ask me, is hempwood gonna work for my project?
[02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:35.780]  I always say, if you think you can or you think you can't,
[02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:38.060]  you're probably right with using hempwood in it
[02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:40.020]  because it's gonna mess up the first time
[02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:41.300]  and you're gonna sand it down.
[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:43.540]  The second time, it's gonna look decent.
[02:11:43.540 --> 02:11:46.380]  So then you rebuild it on the third time
[02:11:46.380 --> 02:11:47.820]  and it's commercially viable.
[02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:50.260]  It just takes that learning curve
[02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:51.940]  and that's why we don't wanna be in Home Depot
[02:11:51.940 --> 02:11:53.500]  and Lowe's and all that stuff
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:56.460]  because the DIY market is not ready.
[02:11:56.460 --> 02:11:59.820]  There's still, we need to still figure out how to use it.
[02:12:04.260 --> 02:12:05.100]  I do have to get going.
[02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:07.300]  I'm going up on the main stage.
[02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:08.140]  So shout out to Grant.
[02:12:08.140 --> 02:12:09.260]  Thank you everybody.
[02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:10.100]  Thanks again.
[02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:11.940]  We even got the hempwood face mask.
[02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:16.060]  Let me go grab a few more other people out there guys.
[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:17.060]  I'll be right back.
[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:19.900]  We'll get back to the music.
[02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:22.300]  All right.
[02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:27.420]  Soothing sounds of the exhibit hall PA system.
[02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:33.140]  Give me a minute.
[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:33.980]  Hold on.
[02:12:51.670 --> 02:12:53.430]  Think before you leap.
[02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:56.990]  Look, observe, feel.
[02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:02.790]  One, two, three, four.
[02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:03.790]  Three, four.
[02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:19.620]  Stop before you go.
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:24.740]  Right now, you get hurt and that's for sure.
[02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:27.180]  Look before you leap.
[02:13:27.180 --> 02:13:31.460]  I say, to prevent is better than having to cure.
[02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:33.380]  Open your eyes and see.
[02:13:34.620 --> 02:13:37.820]  Observe and you will understand.
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:39.500]  So easy will you go.
[02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:43.620]  Can't you see what's going on?
[02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:50.100]  Way over there.
[02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:52.300]  I like to shake my tushy.
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:55.180]  To the reggae beats.
[02:13:56.820 --> 02:13:58.820]  I like to shake my tushy.
[02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:01.500]  To the reggae beats.
[02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:04.660]  So don't fall in the bottomless pit.
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:07.140]  I'm referring to mankind, yeah.
[02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:09.620]  Stop before you go.
[02:14:09.620 --> 02:14:13.700]  Right now, you get hurt and that's for sure.
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:16.140]  Look before you leap.
[02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:20.420]  I say, to prevent is better than having to cure.
[02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:23.420]  The mail just showed up.
[02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:28.420]  Let's see if some fundraiser seed packs arrived.
[02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:30.420]  Hold on.
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:50.340]  By doing so, you can go.
[02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:52.940]  They'll give you a six for a nine.
[02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:56.060]  Watch your step as the mankind does.
[02:14:56.060 --> 02:14:58.500]  Stop before you go.
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:02.700]  Right now, you get hurt and that's for sure.
[02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:05.140]  Look before you leap.
[02:15:05.140 --> 02:15:12.400]  I say, to prevent is better than having to cure.
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:15.600]  Observe and you will understand.
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:17.280]  So easy will you go.
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:21.280]  Can't you see what's going on?
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:23.800]  Stop before you go.
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:28.720]  Right now, you get hurt and that's for sure.
[02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:31.200]  Look before you leap.
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:35.200]  I say, to prevent is better than having to cure.
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:37.120]  Open your eyes and see.
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:41.600]  Observe and you will understand.
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.280]  So easy will you go.
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:48.160]  Can't you see what's going on?
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:49.760]  Stop before you go.
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:54.680]  Right now, you get hurt and that's for sure.
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:56.440]  Look before you leap.
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:15:57.800]  Thank you.
[02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:11.420]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:16.420 --> 02:16:18.620]  You know, we are having fun.
[02:16:18.620 --> 02:16:19.780]  How about you?
[02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:21.940]  Yes.
[02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:25.740]  This one entitled Marvin Art.
[02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:30.460]  One, two, and three, and four.
[02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:31.700]  Let's do it.
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:48.760]  ♪ Not to be children till then
[02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:52.320]  ♪ Marvel not, there will be freedom
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:56.280]  ♪ Marvel not, cause our loved ones will be free
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:58.960]  ♪ But you and the hypocrites have done
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:01.840]  ♪ Traps and snares they have set before us
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:06.240]  ♪ That when we fall, we may never rise
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:13.240]  The farm fungi as well as your own company sir?
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:22.280]  Yeah, my business is Mushroom Cult and we teach mushroom cultivation classes at a pretty
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:23.900]  technical level.
[02:17:23.900 --> 02:17:31.440]  So our class is, we go through the whole process, like maybe starting with spores for a fresh
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:38.920]  mushroom and moving on to an auger plate which is kind of like jello in a small container
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:45.680]  and then moving on to grain spawn which is really, this is hydrated wheat and the mycelium
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:47.800]  is growing on the grain spawn here.
[02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:53.260]  And then finally we move the grain spawn into a bulk substrate bag, this is reishi and it's
[02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:56.500]  growing on sawdust with a little bit of supplement.
[02:17:56.500 --> 02:18:03.680]  So in the class we go through that whole procedure, there's an online class on April 10th, 25
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:07.900]  bucks, really accessible, really interactive, it's live, you're not just paying for a recorded
[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:08.900]  video.
[02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:14.180]  And then we also have an in-person class in Denver on April 17th and 18th which is really
[02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:19.840]  hands on, it's two days and each student will make all their materials, they will go through
[02:18:19.840 --> 02:18:24.900]  each process and we go through all kinds of different rabbit trails of how to use spores
[02:18:24.900 --> 02:18:29.420]  for breeding, how to just get the process done, we go through a few shortcuts on how
[02:18:29.420 --> 02:18:32.980]  to shortcut this complicated process.
[02:18:32.980 --> 02:18:38.180]  My idea behind it is basically we want to teach the most difficult way to grow mushrooms
[02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:42.500]  so that you feel comfortable with that and then you can apply those skills to the more
[02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:47.380]  simpler methods, there's really easy ways to grow mushrooms.
[02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:54.100]  And we also teach those shortcuts so that you're familiar with it and aware of them.
[02:18:54.300 --> 02:18:58.700]  The other one that I would recommend everyone try is PF Tech or brown rice flower technique,
[02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:04.660]  you can grow a lot of different kinds of mushrooms on it and it's as easy as it gets.
[02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:07.900]  So can you kind of show, explain to the viewers what we're looking at right here?
[02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:14.500]  Yeah, so this is a mushroom grow bag, it has an air filtration patch on the top here, so
[02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:18.540]  that allows oxygen and carbon dioxide to be exchanged without allowing contaminants like
[02:19:18.540 --> 02:19:21.900]  mold or yeast or bacteria in there.
[02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:28.020]  Further down in the bag, you can see there's mushroom fruiting body, these are the spore
[02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:33.100]  holding, it's the reproductive structure, so they'll produce spores.
[02:19:33.100 --> 02:19:40.740]  It's growing on a sawdust recipe that all the white is the mycelium, that's the actual
[02:19:40.740 --> 02:19:41.740]  organism.
[02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:47.020]  So when you find a mushroom out in the woods and you pick that mushroom, you're only picking
[02:19:47.020 --> 02:19:50.940]  the fruiting structure like an apple, if you pick an apple off a tree, you're not collecting
[02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:52.100]  the whole tree.
[02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:58.020]  So the whole organism is this block in the bag in the bottom and the fruiting structure
[02:19:58.020 --> 02:19:59.900]  is what's coming out the top.
[02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:04.580]  Reishi is really interesting because it'll grow antlers when it's in high carbon dioxide
[02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:10.100]  environments and it will kind of make a conch like a wood ear when it's in lower carbon
[02:20:10.100 --> 02:20:15.660]  dioxide, so you can kind of manipulate it like a bonsai and create an artistic structure.
[02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:21.020]  I remember in the OG way of growing back when we had just HPS lights, you would set
[02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:25.260]  one of these because of the heat, you would set one of these on top of the heat and then
[02:20:25.260 --> 02:20:31.820]  CO2 was heavier than oxygen so that it would actually fall down and give CO2 to your plants.
[02:20:31.820 --> 02:20:36.580]  This was a really easy stealth way for a lot of the OG cannabis farmers back in the day
[02:20:36.580 --> 02:20:41.500]  to be able to add CO2 without having to worry about having CO2 delivered to their house
[02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:44.940]  or going to some kind of grow especially like this is more maybe even like 10 years
[02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:48.820]  ago where we could just have these little bags, set them on top of the HPS lights.
[02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:54.100]  It seemed like the heat would activate everything within it and then start to fruit.
[02:20:54.100 --> 02:21:02.220]  Yeah, so the mushroom organism, it is closer to being an animal than it is to a plant.
[02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:08.300]  It takes in oxygen and puts out carbon dioxide whereas obviously the plants do the opposite.
[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:11.580]  They take in carbon dioxide, make sugars and they put out oxygen.
[02:21:11.580 --> 02:21:16.300]  So it is kind of the other half of that cycle.
[02:21:16.300 --> 02:21:18.220]  So you can use them in combination.
[02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:22.540]  It loves oxygen and it puts out the carbon dioxide just like what you are looking for.
[02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:26.700]  Yeah, it is an easy and stealth way especially if you are a tent farmer back in the day,
[02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:32.980]  a very cheap way to add CO2 again without having to spend the extra money on tanks,
[02:21:32.980 --> 02:21:35.020]  getting those tanks refilled.
[02:21:35.020 --> 02:21:37.660]  You guys also at your booth, you know you guys are talking about the health benefits
[02:21:38.020 --> 02:21:39.020]  of mushrooms.
[02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:43.340]  I know with Paul Stamets, he has kind of come out and talked about the health benefits of
[02:21:43.340 --> 02:21:47.940]  lion's mane is kind of like the buzzword at least here around here in Denver.
[02:21:47.940 --> 02:21:53.660]  Yeah, so for the classes that I offer, I partner up with my friend Gary from Fresh From the
[02:21:53.660 --> 02:21:54.660]  Farm Fungi.
[02:21:54.660 --> 02:21:58.900]  He is a commercial grower here in Denver and he produces really great lion's mane, which
[02:21:58.900 --> 02:21:59.900]  is what you are referring to.
[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:02.220]  It is kind of like a fluffy pom pom.
[02:22:02.220 --> 02:22:04.220]  It is like a cotton ball.
[02:22:04.220 --> 02:22:13.020]  There has been studies that the lion's mane in animal bodies has a neuro growth factor
[02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:14.900]  stimulating property.
[02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:20.940]  So it could be something that would be beneficial to be eating for long term brain health.
[02:22:20.940 --> 02:22:23.020]  It is not something that is going to get you high.
[02:22:23.020 --> 02:22:27.340]  You are not going to notice that you ate a lion's mane like you would notice you had
[02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:30.860]  a cup of coffee or you smoked a bowl.
[02:22:30.940 --> 02:22:38.500]  But over the long term, evidence suggests that it can really help your neurology.
[02:22:38.500 --> 02:22:43.500]  Also we are talking about cordyceps a little bit, which is a really fascinating mushroom.
[02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:53.780]  It was really brought to the western culture from past Olympics, I think in the 90s.
[02:22:53.780 --> 02:22:59.340]  They were noticing that some of the Chinese teams in endurance events were outperforming
[02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:00.460]  some of the other countries.
[02:23:00.460 --> 02:23:04.660]  They found out that they were using cordyceps.
[02:23:04.660 --> 02:23:09.420]  I have heard that there are studies that it can actually increase the red blood cell content
[02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:10.420]  count.
[02:23:10.420 --> 02:23:17.620]  It has a noticeable stimulant effect, but it is not caffeine.
[02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:19.860]  It has a different feel.
[02:23:19.860 --> 02:23:23.140]  The idea is you drink a coffee and you are ready to go.
[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:24.340]  Cordyceps has a similar impact.
[02:23:24.340 --> 02:23:25.340]  There are lots of studies.
[02:23:25.340 --> 02:23:30.340]  There is a study about its impact with COVID, which seems to be beneficial.
[02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:38.340]  There are studies on manipulating your circadian rhythm by maybe going to a new time zone.
[02:23:38.340 --> 02:23:42.380]  You take cordyceps in the morning and it can help you get back on track.
[02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:45.620]  There are really interesting qualities about it.
[02:23:45.620 --> 02:23:48.140]  The research keeps coming out.
[02:23:48.140 --> 02:23:53.180]  What are some of the best takeaways that you have when you are dealing with mushrooms?
[02:23:53.180 --> 02:23:58.100]  I know it is a fairly easy process to grow as long as there is no contamination.
[02:23:58.100 --> 02:24:01.700]  What are some of the things that you feel like our viewers should take away from mushroom
[02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:02.700]  cultivation?
[02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:03.700]  Mushroom cultivation.
[02:24:03.700 --> 02:24:10.620]  I want you guys to think about how mushrooms are the recyclers of the world.
[02:24:10.620 --> 02:24:13.860]  They take away a product and they transform it.
[02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:16.580]  They use that as a food source.
[02:24:16.580 --> 02:24:19.340]  They are also the great networkers.
[02:24:19.340 --> 02:24:22.740]  A lot of mushroom species and fungi species, which you might be familiar with, aspergillus
[02:24:23.300 --> 02:24:25.340]  is probably in your potting soil.
[02:24:25.340 --> 02:24:28.500]  It's really beneficial for root health.
[02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:33.780]  Mushrooms and other fungi can connect plants with resources, water, minerals.
[02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:36.300]  I want to point out that they are recyclers.
[02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:38.020]  They'll take a waste product.
[02:24:38.020 --> 02:24:42.260]  If you think about your growth, what kind of waste products do you have?
[02:24:42.260 --> 02:24:47.260]  Maybe the stems, the roots, maybe the leaves.
[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:50.780]  I'm not sure what all you're using and how you're using it.
[02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:52.560]  Think about your waste product.
[02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:56.920]  If you're just throwing away your stems, think about the content of those.
[02:24:56.920 --> 02:25:00.960]  Those are cellulose and lignin, largely.
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:05.520]  What this mushroom is eating, it's eating wood, which is lignin and cellulose.
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:07.640]  It's essentially the same thing.
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:11.760]  A lot of mushrooms also grow on straw, which is largely cellulose.
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:16.200]  The waste product that you guys are producing isn't a waste product.
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:20.320]  That can be used to cultivate mushrooms, which maybe to produce CO2.
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:24.680]  You can make a closed-loop system by incorporating mushrooms.
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:29.600]  As far as the cultivation, it can be really complicated, but it doesn't have to be.
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:31.160]  It can be really simple.
[02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:36.200]  One method that's worth checking into is PF Tech or brown rice flour technique.
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:42.720]  It's really just an injection and waiting and putting it in a humid chamber.
[02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:44.880]  That's really fascinating.
[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:49.680]  It's really worth exploring how to cultivate mushrooms.
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:52.200]  You can do that on our YouTube channel.
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:54.600]  We have a few videos about that.
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:58.280]  My buddy Gary from Fresh From the Farm Fungi is really active on that.
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:02.720]  He's putting out a lot of content about mushrooms and how to grow mushrooms.
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:05.520]  It's worth exploring that.
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:07.520]  Get your hands dirty.
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:09.320]  Try growing mushrooms.
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:12.760]  Pick your mushroom of choice.
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:14.880]  What is your mushroom of choice?
[02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:17.760]  I am currently growing reishi.
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:20.160]  My strategy is I'm really a hobbyist.
[02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:21.160]  I'm teaching classes.
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:24.320]  I put a lot of energy into teaching classes.
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:31.040]  As far as my personal growing, I really take a species and I try to take it from spores
[02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:35.080]  or tissue culture all the way to the fruiting.
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:38.200]  I might do that a few times, explore that.
[02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:39.440]  Then I'll move on to another species.
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:43.200]  I've cranked through close to 20 different species.
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:46.400]  I really like reishi for the artistic quality.
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:48.400]  It grows these amazing antlers.
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:51.920]  I think it's beautiful.
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:53.760]  Oysters are really easy to grow.
[02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:57.640]  I recently messed with a bioluminescent mushroom.
[02:26:57.640 --> 02:26:59.440]  It's the genus Ompelotus.
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:01.200]  You might know it in your area.
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:02.520]  It's a jack-o-lantern mushroom.
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:03.960]  They're often a little bit orange.
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:08.360]  They look like an oyster mushroom, but at night they will glow in the dark.
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:09.360]  It's really faint.
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:11.480]  I don't want to give you the wrong idea.
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:16.640]  You're not going to make a lantern with these glow-in-the-dark mushrooms.
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:22.160]  If you get yourself in a really dark place with no light, you might see a faint green
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:25.560]  glow, which is really amazing.
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:29.240]  It happens with jellyfish and fireflies.
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:34.560]  There's bioluminescent creatures out there that we're familiar with, but a mushroom that
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:37.080]  glows in the dark, I think that's really fascinating.
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:40.560]  It's also poisonous, so I'm not doing it to eat it.
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:48.160]  I think every mushroom has value, whether it's a poisonous mushroom or a medicinal mushroom.
[02:27:48.160 --> 02:27:49.160]  They all have value.
[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:53.560]  Some of them are producing chemicals that are great for industrial purposes.
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:55.000]  There are some that make dyes.
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.800]  There are some that make tough materials.
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:04.560]  There's companies that are using reishi to make leather for the fashion industry.
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:07.840]  They're using it to make building materials.
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:09.840]  There's industrial applications.
[02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:12.160]  There's art applications.
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:16.440]  There's medicinal and food qualities to all these mushrooms.
[02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:22.000]  For example, a poisonous mushroom, it's producing more than just poison.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.600]  Sometimes poison is in the dose.
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:28.760]  There's medicines that if you have enough, it's poisonous.
[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:34.200]  We really need to get out there and identify what mushrooms are in our area.
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:42.520]  It's estimated that maybe 10% of all fungi have been even identified towards science.
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:43.520]  We're in the dark.
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:44.760]  We don't even know what's out there.
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:49.640]  Then further, if you identify the mushroom, we don't know what chemical compounds it's
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:50.640]  making.
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:54.000]  We don't know what relationships with animals and plants it's creating.
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.080]  We don't know the relationship with the other microbes.
[02:28:57.080 --> 02:28:59.840]  We really don't know.
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:04.800]  A lot of our medicines are coming from plants and fungi.
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:13.600]  If we, as a society, expand our neighborhoods further and further and further into nature,
[02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:18.920]  we're plowing under those ecosystems that these mushrooms are growing.
[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:21.380]  We don't even know what we're killing.
[02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:24.400]  We could be finding incredible cancer cures.
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:31.120]  We could be finding incredible materials, incredible chemicals, incredible paints and
[02:29:31.120 --> 02:29:32.120]  dyes.
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:37.280]  The potential is really incredible.
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:41.680]  We don't want to just overlook the small mushroom that's growing under the bushes or that's
[02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:42.960]  coming out the side of the tree.
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:44.960]  Really, we want to identify it.
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:48.120]  We want to collect maybe a score print.
[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:55.360]  We want to collect actual growing tissue and get that into those extraction labs, get
[02:29:55.360 --> 02:30:00.880]  that into those testing labs to find out what do we actually have here.
[02:30:00.880 --> 02:30:03.800]  One of the cool things that I learned about mushrooms, I think it was on Joe Rogan, is
[02:30:03.800 --> 02:30:06.720]  that there's actually little spores in space.
[02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:08.800]  Oh yeah, that's funny.
[02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:13.240]  The spore is a genetic vehicle, kind of like a seed.
[02:30:13.240 --> 02:30:17.400]  It's a little different from a seed, but it's also microscopic.
[02:30:17.400 --> 02:30:18.760]  We're talking about dust level.
[02:30:18.760 --> 02:30:23.960]  You can see thousands, millions of spores, but you probably won't see a single spore
[02:30:23.960 --> 02:30:24.960]  with your eye.
[02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:26.640]  You'd need a microscope for that.
[02:30:26.640 --> 02:30:29.400]  They're really durable.
[02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:31.680]  The brown color on this is the chestnut spore.
[02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:37.160]  The brown color on here is something that can protect it from radiation.
[02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:40.680]  It's kind of like melanin in our skin.
[02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:42.800]  It protects from radiation.
[02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:48.040]  There's some of those chemicals built into the spores that can protect it from radiation.
[02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:49.880]  Even in outer space, it can survive.
[02:30:49.880 --> 02:30:56.680]  I can't personally confirm that, but it's estimated that fungi around the globe are
[02:30:56.680 --> 02:31:00.240]  producing 50 million tons of spores every year.
[02:31:00.240 --> 02:31:04.440]  The air around you is full of spores.
[02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:06.120]  You just might not be aware of that.
[02:31:06.120 --> 02:31:07.120]  Right on, brother.
[02:31:07.120 --> 02:31:11.000]  I know your booth up there, you guys are the only two-man band, it seems like, so I don't
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:12.640]  want to take up too much of your time.
[02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:17.520]  How can they find out more about you and your partner upstairs?
[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:19.960]  My website is mushroomcult.net.
[02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:28.240]  From there, you can find links to YouTube, I have a small Etsy store, and the classes.
[02:31:28.240 --> 02:31:31.640]  Fresh from the farm fungi, he's been a huge help on the class.
[02:31:31.640 --> 02:31:33.120]  You can check out his website.
[02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:39.120]  He has cultures of maybe 20 different mushrooms that you can get in a syringe and just inject
[02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:41.160]  right into hydrated grain.
[02:31:42.040 --> 02:31:44.240]  You can grow your own mushrooms.
[02:31:44.240 --> 02:31:45.840]  He also has a really great YouTube channel.
[02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:47.560]  He does Fungi Friday.
[02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:52.680]  Every week, he interviews someone or talks about a topic that he's working on.
[02:31:52.680 --> 02:31:53.680]  Those would be the best places.
[02:31:53.680 --> 02:31:54.680]  Also, TikTok.
[02:31:54.680 --> 02:31:55.680]  Look up both of us on TikTok.
[02:31:55.680 --> 02:31:56.680]  Pretty happy to go to.
[02:31:56.680 --> 02:31:57.680]  Right on.
[02:31:57.680 --> 02:31:58.680]  Thanks a lot.
[02:31:58.680 --> 02:31:59.680]  Yeah, absolutely, brother.
[02:31:59.680 --> 02:32:00.680]  Appreciate your time.
[02:32:00.680 --> 02:32:01.680]  For you guys viewers, I'm going to go grab somebody else.
[02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:06.680]  Again, this is what we're going to be doing all day today, so stay tuned.
[02:32:37.400 --> 02:33:23.420]  Oops, I'm back.
[02:33:23.420 --> 02:33:33.420]  Okay. Back to the music.
[02:33:33.420 --> 02:33:38.420]  Give me a minute.
[02:33:53.420 --> 02:34:03.420]  I'm going to take a break.
[02:34:03.420 --> 02:34:20.820]  Here we go.
[02:34:20.820 --> 02:34:27.870]  Many brothers are gone
[02:34:27.870 --> 02:34:35.280]  Many sisters are gone
[02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:39.280]  The wrong way
[02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:42.280]  All done praying continually
[02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:45.280]  But they realize they are going
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:46.280]  The wrong way
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:49.280]  And take heed
[02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:50.280]  Marvel now, take heed
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:52.280]  Children's Tuesday
[02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:53.280]  Marvel now, there will be
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:55.280]  freedom, freedom
[02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:58.280]  Marvel now, all our loved ones
[02:34:58.280 --> 02:34:59.280]  Will be free
[02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:01.280]  But here are the hypocrites
[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:02.280]  again
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:03.280]  From Simpsons
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:09.900]  And the Lord said before us that when we fall, we may never rise.
[02:35:09.900 --> 02:35:13.940]  But the one Messiah will set us free.
[02:35:13.940 --> 02:35:19.880]  Now, now, iniquity from the city of the people's minds
[02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:21.980]  are filled with envy.
[02:35:21.980 --> 02:35:25.220]  They're robbing people to achieve an ideal,
[02:35:25.220 --> 02:35:30.220]  forget the love of humanity.
[02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:37.200]  But marvel not, I say, each and every.
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:40.160]  Marvel not, I say.
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:44.050]  Oh, oh, oh.
[02:35:44.050 --> 02:35:47.030]  Marvel not, I say.
[02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:50.030]  So it was in the beginning.
[02:35:50.030 --> 02:35:53.510]  Marvel not, I say.
[02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:54.990]  Solidity and the hate.
[02:35:54.990 --> 02:35:56.990]  No, no, no.
[02:35:56.990 --> 02:35:59.470]  Marvel not, I say.
[02:35:59.470 --> 02:36:01.470]  Oh, no, no.
[02:36:02.290 --> 02:36:06.270]  Marvel not, I say.
[02:36:06.270 --> 02:36:07.750]  Oh, oh, oh.
[02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:09.730]  Oh, no.
[02:36:09.730 --> 02:36:11.710]  Marvel not, I say.
[02:36:11.710 --> 02:36:13.190]  No, no, no.
[02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:14.670]  Marvel not.
[02:36:14.670 --> 02:36:17.150]  No, no.
[02:36:17.150 --> 02:38:08.830]  Marvel not, I say.
[02:38:08.830 --> 02:38:10.030]  Now, here's your headphones.
[02:38:10.030 --> 02:38:10.530]  All right.
[02:38:10.530 --> 02:38:16.100]  You can pause.
[02:38:16.100 --> 02:38:18.420]  You might have to wait a second for Peter to come back.
[02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:19.420]  Marvel not.
[02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:20.900]  And me and Peter can get back.
[02:38:20.900 --> 02:38:23.300]  Yeah.
[02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:25.180]  So we have a special treat for you guys,
[02:38:25.180 --> 02:38:26.860]  the Living Soil community.
[02:38:26.860 --> 02:38:29.220]  This is Jack Herr.
[02:38:29.220 --> 02:38:30.100]  How do you say that?
[02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:31.020]  Herr like terror.
[02:38:31.020 --> 02:38:32.100]  Herr like terror.
[02:38:32.100 --> 02:38:34.820]  I always kind of mispronounce my brother.
[02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:38.060]  But this is the OG, if you will, son.
[02:38:38.060 --> 02:38:41.420]  A lot of people out here really admire your father,
[02:38:41.420 --> 02:38:42.300]  especially the book.
[02:38:42.300 --> 02:38:45.460]  We just had Bruce, who can't hear anything.
[02:38:45.460 --> 02:38:46.940]  No.
[02:38:46.940 --> 02:38:48.460]  What do we got coming?
[02:38:48.460 --> 02:38:50.060]  Well, no, he's the only one talking.
[02:38:50.060 --> 02:38:50.540]  Right.
[02:38:50.540 --> 02:38:51.460]  You can't hear me talking?
[02:38:51.460 --> 02:38:52.180]  No, really.
[02:38:52.180 --> 02:38:53.180]  Oh, OK.
[02:38:53.220 --> 02:38:54.820]  Well, we might not need those, I guess.
[02:38:54.820 --> 02:38:58.700]  I can hear you, but it's just a low.
[02:38:58.700 --> 02:39:01.300]  Peter, can you talk and see if we can hear?
[02:39:01.300 --> 02:39:01.820]  You speak so.
[02:39:01.820 --> 02:39:03.780]  Picking up sticks.
[02:39:03.780 --> 02:39:05.300]  Picking up sticks.
[02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:06.700]  I can hear that now.
[02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:11.180]  You met my friend Matt the other day at the El Rancho.
[02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:12.420]  A pedigree.
[02:39:12.420 --> 02:39:14.540]  Oh, I know Matt.
[02:39:14.540 --> 02:39:15.780]  That's my boy.
[02:39:15.780 --> 02:39:17.620]  Matt's a good man.
[02:39:17.620 --> 02:39:18.340]  Small world.
[02:39:18.340 --> 02:39:20.420]  So our viewers, like I was saying, man,
[02:39:20.420 --> 02:39:23.380]  we're really big cannabis enthusiasts.
[02:39:23.380 --> 02:39:26.180]  We love to grow cannabis using microbial world instead
[02:39:26.180 --> 02:39:28.260]  of synthetics.
[02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:31.660]  Your father was a big proponent of just hemp in general.
[02:39:31.660 --> 02:39:32.580]  So all things cannabis.
[02:39:32.580 --> 02:39:33.460]  All things cannabis.
[02:39:33.460 --> 02:39:37.260]  But Bruce was telling us that he felt like your father was
[02:39:37.260 --> 02:39:39.380]  more geared toward hemp, because he felt like that would be
[02:39:39.380 --> 02:39:41.620]  legalized first.
[02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:48.900]  Well, my father was more geared toward understanding cannabis
[02:39:48.900 --> 02:39:50.700]  to its full utility.
[02:39:50.700 --> 02:39:57.060]  And being that hemp was so immediately useful for all
[02:39:57.060 --> 02:40:01.660]  things that we touch and interact with today,
[02:40:01.660 --> 02:40:05.900]  that that seemed to be the avenue that
[02:40:05.900 --> 02:40:07.940]  should have hit first.
[02:40:07.940 --> 02:40:11.260]  So back in the late 80s, the early 90s,
[02:40:11.260 --> 02:40:14.100]  after he wrote the book, The Emperor Wears No Clothes,
[02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:17.740]  he really started bringing people into the understanding
[02:40:17.780 --> 02:40:22.220]  that we need to start with what we have access to.
[02:40:22.220 --> 02:40:27.060]  And that was hemp-based products primarily out of China
[02:40:27.060 --> 02:40:30.460]  through cordage, the stuff for the shirts
[02:40:30.460 --> 02:40:33.220]  that my father used to wear, or T-shirts, or shoes,
[02:40:33.220 --> 02:40:34.980]  or whatever it was.
[02:40:34.980 --> 02:40:38.820]  And because there wasn't this stigma
[02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:41.060]  with wearing a piece of clothing,
[02:40:41.060 --> 02:40:44.900]  other than somebody saying, oh, can you smoke that?
[02:40:44.900 --> 02:40:46.500]  It's completely silly.
[02:40:47.500 --> 02:40:51.260]  But that's really where the psyche of people's
[02:40:51.260 --> 02:40:53.420]  understanding was, that even if you told them
[02:40:53.420 --> 02:40:55.660]  that this was made from cannabis,
[02:40:55.660 --> 02:40:58.620]  their first reaction is, can you smoke it?
[02:40:58.620 --> 02:41:00.820]  And some of it was just out of ignorance.
[02:41:00.820 --> 02:41:04.380]  And the other was just trying to poke fun at, oh, you're
[02:41:04.380 --> 02:41:07.340]  just wearing cannabis because you're pointing to this,
[02:41:07.340 --> 02:41:09.100]  but you really want this.
[02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:14.420]  And so my father's real, I would say,
[02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:19.260]  mission was to just educate people to not be so,
[02:41:22.340 --> 02:41:23.780]  how can I say this politely?
[02:41:25.780 --> 02:41:27.020]  Willfully ignorant.
[02:41:28.260 --> 02:41:30.460]  Because when the information is out there
[02:41:30.460 --> 02:41:33.980]  and you choose not to address it, not to listen to it,
[02:41:33.980 --> 02:41:38.980]  not to take it in, and just continue building the walls
[02:41:39.060 --> 02:41:41.180]  in which separates the understanding
[02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:44.700]  of what cannabis has been throughout history,
[02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:47.500]  not just American history, but global history,
[02:41:47.500 --> 02:41:52.020]  that it really took a lot of extra energy
[02:41:52.020 --> 02:41:55.220]  to start tearing down those walls.
[02:41:55.220 --> 02:41:59.500]  And a lot of that is what you see happening here at the show
[02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:03.300]  with people taking hemp and creating building products,
[02:42:03.300 --> 02:42:05.700]  creating flooring, creating new plastics,
[02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:07.580]  creating new technologies.
[02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:12.300]  And so he really pushed that idea that all of the things
[02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:15.060]  that we come in contact with every day, our phones,
[02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:19.340]  our computers that are surrounded or covered in plastic,
[02:42:19.340 --> 02:42:21.780]  the parts of our cars, things like that,
[02:42:21.780 --> 02:42:23.740]  all of these could be made safer,
[02:42:23.740 --> 02:42:27.180]  non-toxic, renewable with hemp.
[02:42:27.180 --> 02:42:29.660]  And he went back into history to say,
[02:42:29.660 --> 02:42:34.660]  look, Henry Ford was building bio cars,
[02:42:35.500 --> 02:42:37.740]  running on bio fuel.
[02:42:37.740 --> 02:42:40.740]  And he really wanted to get a connection with people
[02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:42.580]  with things that they can relate to.
[02:42:43.540 --> 02:42:47.420]  Some of it is today, or for the last 20 years,
[02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:51.180]  Mercedes and BMW have been manufacturing interiors
[02:42:51.180 --> 02:42:53.060]  of their vehicles using cannabis,
[02:42:53.060 --> 02:42:54.420]  but they don't talk about it.
[02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:55.940]  My father did.
[02:42:55.940 --> 02:42:58.220]  So when you're talking to somebody
[02:42:58.220 --> 02:42:59.860]  who's at the top of their lungs
[02:42:59.860 --> 02:43:03.260]  or with all of their moral fiber,
[02:43:03.260 --> 02:43:06.700]  pushing back against that which you believe is true
[02:43:06.700 --> 02:43:09.820]  and correct with hemp or cannabis,
[02:43:09.820 --> 02:43:11.540]  and they're pushing back and they're saying,
[02:43:11.540 --> 02:43:14.620]  this is bad, there's no real use for this
[02:43:14.620 --> 02:43:17.080]  other than you just want to smoke this drug.
[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:20.260]  And then they're like, well, you drive this Mercedes E3,
[02:43:20.260 --> 02:43:24.900]  whatever, or E500 or this BMW,
[02:43:24.900 --> 02:43:27.660]  and did you know that the interiors of those cars
[02:43:27.660 --> 02:43:29.180]  are made with the same plant?
[02:43:29.180 --> 02:43:32.180]  And the car is made better and safer and non-toxic
[02:43:32.700 --> 02:43:35.660]  and more renewable because of cannabis.
[02:43:35.660 --> 02:43:38.740]  And yet you're pushing back with every moral fiber
[02:43:38.740 --> 02:43:41.620]  of your being against something that's making you safer
[02:43:41.620 --> 02:43:43.780]  in the car which you're driving.
[02:43:43.780 --> 02:43:47.560]  And being able to have that connection
[02:43:47.560 --> 02:43:49.460]  where all of a sudden the light bulb turns on
[02:43:49.460 --> 02:43:51.860]  and I go, the door panel's in my car.
[02:43:52.780 --> 02:43:55.060]  You know, it's something that they can relate to
[02:43:55.060 --> 02:43:56.740]  that's not fearful.
[02:43:56.740 --> 02:43:59.300]  I've been driving that car for five years.
[02:43:59.300 --> 02:44:00.500]  I didn't know.
[02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:03.460]  It's because cannabis and its understanding
[02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:05.300]  has been removed from our history.
[02:44:05.300 --> 02:44:08.460]  So when you look at this book, it helps.
[02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:09.300]  Let's show that again.
[02:44:09.300 --> 02:44:11.900]  I'm sure people are popping in and off all day.
[02:44:11.900 --> 02:44:13.500]  This is the same book that Bruce
[02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:15.260]  was just talking about, obviously.
[02:44:15.260 --> 02:44:17.140]  We just have his son here.
[02:44:17.140 --> 02:44:18.420]  Well, not Bruce's son.
[02:44:18.420 --> 02:44:19.820]  No, no, no, Jack's son, yes.
[02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:22.540]  Sorry if I misled there.
[02:44:22.540 --> 02:44:24.220]  Bruce was just talking about your father,
[02:44:24.220 --> 02:44:25.860]  singing his praises.
[02:44:25.860 --> 02:44:27.960]  It was great that I was able to kind of catch you.
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:29.940]  What are some of the things that you love
[02:44:30.340 --> 02:44:32.460]  for the viewers to know about your father?
[02:44:32.460 --> 02:44:36.140]  Well, one, that my father was not a plant.
[02:44:37.780 --> 02:44:39.740]  There is a...
[02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:43.140]  A cultivar named after him.
[02:44:43.140 --> 02:44:45.820]  There is a cultivar named after my father.
[02:44:45.820 --> 02:44:48.540]  It is what we use in the Jack Herough
[02:44:48.540 --> 02:44:50.460]  branded cannabis products.
[02:44:50.460 --> 02:44:54.100]  But more than that, because my father's life
[02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:57.740]  represents more than just what people today understand
[02:44:57.740 --> 02:45:01.180]  on many levels, is that my father was involved
[02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:04.540]  in every cannabis legalization measure,
[02:45:04.540 --> 02:45:09.540]  or he was the proponent of different propositions
[02:45:10.380 --> 02:45:12.060]  since 1976.
[02:45:12.060 --> 02:45:15.840]  He was a supporter of the 1972 Prop 19 in California,
[02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:19.220]  which at that time during the Nixon administration
[02:45:19.220 --> 02:45:23.740]  got 39% of the vote, not quite enough to get it passed,
[02:45:23.740 --> 02:45:28.140]  but it was the first time that a cannabis proposition
[02:45:28.140 --> 02:45:31.380]  had been on any ballot in the United States
[02:45:31.380 --> 02:45:34.140]  since Prohibition.
[02:45:34.140 --> 02:45:36.740]  And it became his mission,
[02:45:36.740 --> 02:45:40.180]  not only to end the war on cannabis,
[02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:44.740]  but to continue to educate folks that this is a plant
[02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:48.300]  that is not harmful to mankind, that this is beneficial to.
[02:45:48.300 --> 02:45:52.340]  So from 1976 as a young boy to 1980,
[02:45:52.380 --> 02:45:55.060]  when I was first able to start registering voters
[02:45:55.060 --> 02:45:56.820]  and going out and collecting signatures
[02:45:56.820 --> 02:45:58.960]  to try to change these laws,
[02:45:58.960 --> 02:46:02.340]  my father was the proponent of these initiatives.
[02:46:02.340 --> 02:46:05.380]  Literally from that point through the end of his life
[02:46:05.380 --> 02:46:10.380]  in 2010, he was behind either as a proponent
[02:46:11.380 --> 02:46:13.540]  or a supporter of every initiative,
[02:46:13.540 --> 02:46:15.820]  not just in the state of California,
[02:46:15.820 --> 02:46:20.020]  but here in Denver or in Washington State
[02:46:20.020 --> 02:46:22.860]  or in Oregon or in Alaska,
[02:46:22.860 --> 02:46:27.100]  at many of these states that passed some level
[02:46:27.100 --> 02:46:29.420]  of cannabis access or laws,
[02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:33.420]  or tried to pass new legislation for laws
[02:46:33.420 --> 02:46:36.580]  that would allow people to have access to this,
[02:46:36.580 --> 02:46:40.100]  that he was there and that it was his voice
[02:46:40.100 --> 02:46:41.780]  and particularly this book,
[02:46:43.340 --> 02:46:46.460]  it really for the first time gave people
[02:46:47.620 --> 02:46:49.800]  an understanding of everything that they believe,
[02:46:50.580 --> 02:46:52.200]  but they didn't know how to prove it.
[02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:54.120]  They didn't know how to define it in a way
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:56.520]  that's like, this is ironclad,
[02:46:56.520 --> 02:46:58.200]  this has all of the documentation,
[02:46:58.200 --> 02:47:00.840]  this has all of the studies that have not been
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:08.600]  altered or misrepresented.
[02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:11.960]  I love how tactful you're being right now.
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:16.480]  And what it did is it allowed people for the first time
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:20.080]  to realize that this book was their advocate.
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:24.280]  This was in a sense, their Bible on cannabis
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:25.560]  and its history.
[02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:28.680]  And this gave them the ability to stand up
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:30.320]  and know that the things that they were saying
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:33.120]  about hemp or cannabis was true, correct,
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:35.880]  and provable and documented in a way
[02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:39.840]  that had never been in our history,
[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:43.040]  because we've grown up with 10 decades,
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:46.520]  literally of misinformation, disinformation,
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:51.520]  absolute lies that really separated our understanding.
[02:47:53.160 --> 02:47:56.000]  And that separation went all the way into
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.560]  what we were taught or weren't taught in schools,
[02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:02.000]  what are shown and described in museums.
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:06.160]  And so like when you go to the Smithsonian Institute,
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:10.000]  it's supposed to be the bastion of American history.
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:11.880]  And you go in there and you see,
[02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:16.600]  let's say Benjamin Franklin's printing press,
[02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:20.600]  which printed a hemp paper or Betsy Ross's flag
[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:24.600]  or anything colonial, military clothing,
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:30.340]  or even just regular peasant clothing.
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:35.240]  These were made from hemp.
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:37.080]  But when you go into the Smithsonian,
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:39.200]  if it's something that's made from wool,
[02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:42.800]  it says this is made from the wool of X,
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:46.500]  and this is made from cotton, and this is made from silk.
[02:48:46.500 --> 02:48:48.920]  Anything that was related to cannabis,
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:52.060]  so if this was a military uniform
[02:48:52.060 --> 02:48:55.600]  that was made from cannabis, it would say other material.
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:48:58.880]  So even with that, and even knowing that you can prove
[02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:02.320]  that this garment was made from cannabis.
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:04.720]  They don't wanna talk.
[02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:07.600]  They don't even acknowledge it.
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:10.600]  When they talk about the US Constitution,
[02:49:10.600 --> 02:49:14.040]  which was a ship that's called Old Ironsides,
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:16.880]  if you're talking about the history
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:21.880]  of the United States sailing fleets,
[02:49:21.900 --> 02:49:26.900]  this is a ship that required nearly 100 tons of hemp
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:30.600]  in order to keep this thing up and running,
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:34.080]  from its ropes and riggings to its logs,
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:41.240]  it's canvas sails, or canvas is a Dutch pronunciation
[02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:44.480]  of a Greek word of cannabis.
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:48.000]  So if it says this is a canvas sail
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.320]  or a canvas covered wagon that came west,
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:52.840]  these were all cannabis covered wagons.
[02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:55.480]  These were all cannabis sails.
[02:49:55.480 --> 02:50:00.480]  When you talk about the history of what this plant is,
[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:05.640]  this book gave people that encouragement,
[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:12.120]  that belief in it, that gave them the ability
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:13.560]  to stand up in their communities,
[02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:16.760]  demand access to this plant that has never killed.
[02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:20.600]  Nobody's ever died from smoking cannabis.
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:24.680]  Nobody's ever died from smoking hemp.
[02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:27.000]  These were things that were grown on our farms.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:28.200]  These were things that were grown
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:33.200]  in every single colonial development here.
[02:50:34.040 --> 02:50:38.400]  All colonies grew hemp.
[02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:39.920]  You could pay your taxes with it.
[02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:44.840]  You can virtually do anything with it throughout our history.
[02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:46.600]  It's only been in the last 100 years
[02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:47.960]  that it's been demonized to the point
[02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:50.040]  where it's actually been removed from our history,
[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:51.360]  except for the fear part.
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:57.120]  And so my father really is the inspiration
[02:50:57.120 --> 02:50:58.520]  behind the folks that you see here
[02:50:58.520 --> 02:51:00.360]  that are coming up with new plastics,
[02:51:00.360 --> 02:51:02.280]  new technologies and clothing,
[02:51:02.280 --> 02:51:04.640]  new flooring, new building materials.
[02:51:04.640 --> 02:51:07.960]  These are things that change how we live.
[02:51:07.960 --> 02:51:11.760]  It changes the environments in which we live
[02:51:11.760 --> 02:51:16.200]  to a less toxic or non-toxic, renewable way of living,
[02:51:16.200 --> 02:51:18.400]  which is completely opposite to everything
[02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:20.400]  that's happened in the last 100 years,
[02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:25.400]  where we literally relied on plastics made from petroleum,
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:30.000]  medicines made from those same petroleum products.
[02:51:30.040 --> 02:51:33.760]  So when you talk about natural healing,
[02:51:33.760 --> 02:51:37.880]  cannabis has been a part of every aromatic medicine,
[02:51:37.880 --> 02:51:40.960]  whether it was India or Thailand or China,
[02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:47.840]  concoctions made with hemp or cannabis
[02:51:47.920 --> 02:51:52.920]  has been a part of all healing of mankind and animals
[02:51:53.080 --> 02:51:55.160]  for tens of thousands of years.
[02:51:55.160 --> 02:51:58.040]  And this book helps to tell that story.
[02:51:58.040 --> 02:52:03.040]  And so this is what my father should be recognized for.
[02:52:03.200 --> 02:52:04.800]  So when I come here and I see
[02:52:04.800 --> 02:52:06.880]  all of these amazing things happening,
[02:52:06.880 --> 02:52:08.600]  I feel my father's energy,
[02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:11.480]  including the hemp hat that you're wearing
[02:52:11.480 --> 02:52:13.120]  or the hemp hat that I'm wearing.
[02:52:13.960 --> 02:52:18.360]  These technologies, these things have been around forever
[02:52:18.360 --> 02:52:20.360]  and now we're just re-embracing them
[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:23.840]  and we're engaging them in a way that creates new jobs,
[02:52:23.840 --> 02:52:27.440]  new commerce, new opportunities, new taxation.
[02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:32.080]  And give us a way to build our communities,
[02:52:32.080 --> 02:52:33.600]  to build our relationships,
[02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:37.880]  to improve our states or our cities or this country.
[02:52:39.360 --> 02:52:44.200]  And it gives us an opportunity to change,
[02:52:44.200 --> 02:52:46.640]  not just how we're gonna survive in the future,
[02:52:46.640 --> 02:52:48.280]  but how we're gonna thrive in it.
[02:52:48.280 --> 02:52:50.920]  And by embracing this plant to its full utility
[02:52:51.720 --> 02:52:56.160]  is probably my father's most important legacy.
[02:52:58.320 --> 02:53:01.080]  And it's not so much the products,
[02:53:01.080 --> 02:53:02.960]  it's the people that have embraced the plant
[02:53:02.960 --> 02:53:04.000]  to create those products.
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:09.000]  So my father's real legacy is not me, it's not my family.
[02:53:09.480 --> 02:53:11.160]  My father's real legacy is the people
[02:53:11.160 --> 02:53:16.160]  that embraced this plant and their innovations
[02:53:16.240 --> 02:53:19.320]  that they're creating using the opportunity
[02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:21.560]  to explore what this plant can do.
[02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:23.560]  Absolutely, I mean, Bruce said he read that book
[02:53:23.560 --> 02:53:26.280]  and then started to look for different materials.
[02:53:26.320 --> 02:53:29.560]  I'm sure there's thousands, tens of thousands of people
[02:53:29.560 --> 02:53:31.880]  that probably have that same reaction.
[02:53:31.880 --> 02:53:34.040]  Removing your father from the situation,
[02:53:34.040 --> 02:53:35.880]  let's talk about Dan for a second.
[02:53:35.880 --> 02:53:37.800]  What is Dan working on?
[02:53:37.800 --> 02:53:42.320]  Well, honestly, it's not significantly different
[02:53:42.320 --> 02:53:43.360]  than how I grew up.
[02:53:45.440 --> 02:53:50.440]  My father's educating of me is no different
[02:53:50.880 --> 02:53:53.320]  than how it's influenced the people that are here.
[02:53:53.360 --> 02:53:56.760]  I remember reading this book when I first read it,
[02:53:56.760 --> 02:53:59.200]  because it was my father who wrote it.
[02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:01.080]  It's like, ah, how important,
[02:54:01.080 --> 02:54:02.680]  I've seen that man in his underwear.
[02:54:02.680 --> 02:54:04.920]  You see him in his, yeah, yeah.
[02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:08.920]  I've seen my dad as, you know, he's a family member.
[02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:10.880]  You know, it's like, yo, it's like,
[02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:13.200]  ah, old uncle Fred wrote a book.
[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:16.400]  You know, but no, so there was a little resistance
[02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:18.160]  to really take this to heart.
[02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:21.840]  You know, but I was in my teens.
[02:54:21.840 --> 02:54:22.840]  Early 20s.
[02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:25.520]  And I was just like, yeah, dad, whatever.
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:27.520]  Hemp's gonna save the world.
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:29.760]  You're a fucking crazy person.
[02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:31.440]  You know?
[02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:34.160]  And the truth is, my dad was crazy.
[02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:39.160]  He was, he was absolutely 100% committed
[02:54:39.480 --> 02:54:42.440]  to the understanding that hemp was gonna save the world.
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:45.040]  And I was absolutely 100% committed to,
[02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:47.280]  dad, you're out of your fricking mind.
[02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:51.520]  And he was, but he wasn't wrong.
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:53.600]  You know, here we are 40 years later.
[02:54:54.800 --> 02:54:56.920]  And all of the things that my father was telling me
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:54:58.760]  back in the 70s and the 80s.
[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:01.080]  It's coming to fruition.
[02:55:01.080 --> 02:55:03.280]  Are not only coming to fruition,
[02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:08.080]  but the world isn't fighting to put people in jail as much
[02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:09.360]  because of cannabis and hemp.
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:12.280]  They're fighting to figure out how they're gonna use this
[02:55:12.280 --> 02:55:14.200]  to make their communities better.
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:16.680]  From a state or a country standpoint,
[02:55:16.680 --> 02:55:18.240]  they're like, how can we raise money?
[02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:20.480]  How can we tax the shit out of this?
[02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:22.840]  And, but from the other side,
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:25.160]  the people like you, myself, and the people that are here,
[02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:27.160]  they're like, I'm gonna take this plant
[02:55:27.160 --> 02:55:29.400]  and I'm gonna change the world.
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:31.440]  And that is important.
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:33.280]  And the fact that we still have to go through
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:37.040]  this political BS and play this cat and mouse game.
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:38.160]  Oh, it's CBD.
[02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:39.040]  Oh, it's hemp.
[02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:40.360]  It's not dangerous.
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:43.520]  Oh, THC, that needs to be controlled
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:46.360]  because it's this dangerous thing that has,
[02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:49.080]  you know, creative thought and helps you
[02:55:49.080 --> 02:55:53.080]  to understand poetry or music or the meaning of life.
[02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:54.440]  That could be very dangerous.
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:56.560]  That's very subversive, you know?
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:00.440]  And so, you know, there's this whole separation
[02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:03.680]  of acceptance of hemp with the demonization of cannabis
[02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:07.000]  that's still happening even between the political,
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:10.000]  you know, communities, those who are embracing hemp,
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:13.400]  but still arms distance from cannabis.
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:15.760]  And it's still because the narrative
[02:56:15.760 --> 02:56:18.680]  that has been spoken for so long has been so powerful
[02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:23.360]  and so ingrained that so many people are resistant
[02:56:23.360 --> 02:56:27.520]  to think that how, if they were an educated person,
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:29.480]  how could they have been so misled
[02:56:29.480 --> 02:56:33.640]  as to believe all of this falsehood, you know?
[02:56:33.640 --> 02:56:37.160]  And the admitting that you've learned something improperly
[02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:40.400]  or that what you've learned is absolute based on lies
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:43.920]  and fear and not fact, it's, you know,
[02:56:43.920 --> 02:56:47.320]  their belief is completely based in fiction.
[02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:51.960]  But that reality is so strong that they're just like,
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:54.880]  nope, I couldn't be that ignorant.
[02:56:54.880 --> 02:56:57.440]  I'm gonna stick with what I've grown up with.
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:56:59.680]  And that's the problem that we have to get through now
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:02.480]  is that we have to realize that the things
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:05.040]  that we've learned weren't exactly the truth.
[02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:07.760]  They were just what we were supposed to, you know,
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:12.200]  to believe because the narrative to the opposite
[02:57:12.200 --> 02:57:16.440]  is so different than our reality.
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:20.240]  You know, if you look at everything that was happening
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:23.000]  in the 1920s and 1930s with the progression
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:26.160]  of consumer packaged goods, with paper products,
[02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:29.040]  with chemical-based, you know, clothing,
[02:57:29.040 --> 02:57:31.760]  all of these things were all created
[02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:35.680]  from a much, much cheaper commodity called oil.
[02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:38.200]  And many of these businesses, you know,
[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:41.560]  when you talk about Dow and DuPont and Hearst,
[02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:43.760]  all of these things, there's a relationship there.
[02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:45.520]  Now, is there a direct relationship?
[02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:46.840]  Yeah, there is.
[02:57:46.840 --> 02:57:48.560]  You know, was it a direct conspiracy?
[02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:51.120]  Did they think that, hey, if we eliminate cannabis
[02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:54.120]  from the world, we're all gonna, you know,
[02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:56.600]  in their minds, they're like protecting the industries
[02:57:56.600 --> 02:57:57.440]  that they were building
[02:57:57.440 --> 02:57:59.360]  because they're protecting their profits.
[02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:02.160]  I don't think that, you know, 90 years ago
[02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:04.600]  when they were trying to outlaw cannabis and hemp
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:06.600]  that they were really looking at, you know,
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:09.320]  if we just eliminate this one plant,
[02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:10.440]  everything's gonna be okay.
[02:58:10.440 --> 02:58:12.360]  We're gonna make millions or billions of dollars
[02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:15.120]  over the next 50 years or 100 years.
[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:17.840]  But we're gonna destroy the planet at the same time.
[02:58:17.840 --> 02:58:20.200]  I don't think they really looked at destroying the planet
[02:58:20.200 --> 02:58:24.320]  or how we interacted with where and how we live.
[02:58:24.320 --> 02:58:26.920]  I think they were just really more concerned
[02:58:26.920 --> 02:58:31.920]  about losing control of their businesses or their profits
[02:58:32.280 --> 02:58:34.800]  and being representative to their shareholders
[02:58:34.800 --> 02:58:36.880]  or just their bank account in general.
[02:58:37.880 --> 02:58:41.760]  But the reality is now that we understand what cannabis was
[02:58:41.760 --> 02:58:43.640]  and what it could be,
[02:58:43.760 --> 02:58:46.720]  that we realize that when you take something
[02:58:46.720 --> 02:58:50.280]  out of an ecosystem that is so fundamentally important,
[02:58:51.240 --> 02:58:54.720]  that the dominoes that fall after, you know,
[02:58:54.720 --> 02:58:58.360]  clean water, clean oceans, clean soil,
[02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:01.720]  the products that we wear on our skin, you know,
[02:59:01.720 --> 02:59:03.560]  did we think that the clothes that we wear,
[02:59:03.560 --> 02:59:06.600]  that the chemicals that were in the cottons
[02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:09.080]  or what seep into our skin and poison us
[02:59:09.080 --> 02:59:11.880]  and create, you know, potential health issues?
[02:59:11.880 --> 02:59:14.440]  No, we're just like, yeah, we got cheap clothes.
[02:59:14.440 --> 02:59:18.160]  You know, so taking something like hemp
[02:59:18.160 --> 02:59:21.720]  out of that ecosystem and out of the use
[02:59:21.720 --> 02:59:25.640]  changed literally how we've lived for the last 100 years.
[02:59:25.640 --> 02:59:29.080]  Now we're finding out that we need to re-embrace this
[02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:32.240]  so we can figure out how we live for the next thousand.
[02:59:33.400 --> 02:59:35.400]  You know, and these are the things
[02:59:35.400 --> 02:59:37.640]  that my father should be known for.
[02:59:37.640 --> 02:59:39.960]  You know, the fact that you can celebrate
[02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:44.240]  by smoking a joint of Jack Herb is a great thing.
[02:59:45.120 --> 02:59:47.000]  It's not the most important thing.
[02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:50.480]  The most important thing is realizing the truth
[02:59:50.480 --> 02:59:52.960]  that we all have to be a part of expressing,
[02:59:54.160 --> 02:59:57.320]  the truth that we need to still expose
[02:59:57.320 --> 03:00:00.760]  and the embracing of what can happen
[03:00:00.760 --> 03:00:04.200]  when you take this plant and use it to its full utility.
[03:00:04.200 --> 03:00:09.200]  And everything else is just a bonus.
[03:00:10.840 --> 03:00:15.240]  And looking at the importance
[03:00:15.240 --> 03:00:18.720]  of how we function as a society, how we treat each other,
[03:00:19.720 --> 03:00:23.920]  how we process real information instead of disinformation
[03:00:23.920 --> 03:00:25.640]  is really, really important.
[03:00:25.640 --> 03:00:28.800]  So when you think of the cannabis industry
[03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:31.480]  or you think of like the cannabis brand
[03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:36.480]  and you're like, oh, this was a singer or an artist
[03:00:37.200 --> 03:00:41.880]  or a celebrity that is doing this brand
[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:44.160]  because they've been involved in cannabis their whole life.
[03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:45.800]  They've smoked it, they've enjoyed it.
[03:00:45.800 --> 03:00:48.520]  They've, you know, some have even gone to jail for it.
[03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:53.000]  And that's great that these companies exist.
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:56.840]  When it comes to the Jack Herb brand,
[03:00:57.880 --> 03:01:00.480]  and you start talking about the cannabis side of it,
[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:04.400]  that that brand is really the why of cannabis,
[03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:07.800]  not really the how I can get high of cannabis,
[03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:10.080]  but really why we're here.
[03:01:10.080 --> 03:01:12.560]  You know, why is it recognized?
[03:01:12.560 --> 03:01:14.880]  Because my father's name, because of this book
[03:01:14.880 --> 03:01:18.080]  and his dedication to the freedom of cannabis
[03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:22.640]  and the ending of prohibition was so profound
[03:01:22.640 --> 03:01:25.600]  that this flower would be named after him
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:31.640]  and really represent the real history and legacy
[03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:35.400]  of what we now know as consumer cannabis.
[03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:39.280]  That's a, you know, for me, that's a great thing.
[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:43.480]  For our family, it's, you know, obviously it affects us all,
[03:01:43.480 --> 03:01:48.200]  but the things that really are most important
[03:01:48.200 --> 03:01:52.400]  is changing the idea of what cannabis is and how we use it.
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:56.280]  And that's really the strongest thing I can say about,
[03:01:56.280 --> 03:02:00.840]  you know, who and why you should look at who my father was
[03:02:01.040 --> 03:02:02.480]  and what he did.
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:04.760]  And then, you know, for the viewers out there,
[03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:06.200]  I would imagine most people know, I mean,
[03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:08.000]  this is the OG of OG.
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.080]  So I would imagine there's probably going to be
[03:02:10.080 --> 03:02:11.400]  a couple of questions for you, sir,
[03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:14.040]  if we could throw a couple of questions to you.
[03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:18.400]  Are you doing work currently with Jack?
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:23.520]  We are expanding the Jack Herb Cannabis
[03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:24.720]  across the United States
[03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:27.160]  through very strategic relationships.
[03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:32.360]  And I'm really proud to represent my family
[03:02:34.160 --> 03:02:38.160]  and what this brand really stands for.
[03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:43.160]  And for us, you know, we look from the cannabis side,
[03:02:44.680 --> 03:02:48.240]  you know, we look at Jack Herb, the brand,
[03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:51.000]  as this should be every person's cannabis.
[03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.240]  This shouldn't be the most expensive product
[03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:54.840]  that's in a dispensary.
[03:02:54.880 --> 03:02:56.400]  Not that we don't have products
[03:02:56.400 --> 03:02:57.920]  that are made in a different way,
[03:02:57.920 --> 03:02:59.520]  that is at a higher level,
[03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:04.160]  but that if somebody really wants good Jack,
[03:03:04.160 --> 03:03:05.720]  that they come to this brand,
[03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:08.320]  which is the original Jack Herb.
[03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:13.000]  And they know that this is, one, represents this family.
[03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:16.560]  It represents the ideas of my father.
[03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:19.960]  And it represents community, not commodity.
[03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:22.480]  And by making it affordable and accessible
[03:03:22.520 --> 03:03:24.720]  for everybody who wants to enjoy a cannabis
[03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:27.720]  that has been looked to and has been a part of,
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:31.600]  really the beginnings of both medicinal
[03:03:31.600 --> 03:03:33.760]  and recreational cannabis,
[03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:37.240]  that this is something that you can look to,
[03:03:37.240 --> 03:03:39.240]  you know, like many of the major brands
[03:03:39.240 --> 03:03:43.760]  that we, you know, go to in our daily lives.
[03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:47.280]  And we really hope that we're setting the standard
[03:03:47.280 --> 03:03:49.520]  for what it is that people consume
[03:03:49.520 --> 03:03:51.320]  that has my father's name on it.
[03:03:51.360 --> 03:03:53.480]  And if it's connected to this family,
[03:03:53.480 --> 03:03:55.400]  and not just somebody who's putting my dad's name
[03:03:55.400 --> 03:03:58.040]  on a product, it's like, yeah, this is Jack Herb.
[03:03:58.040 --> 03:03:58.880]  And there's a lot of that.
[03:03:58.880 --> 03:04:00.200]  Yeah, and there's a lot of that.
[03:04:00.200 --> 03:04:04.240]  And you know, that's all gonna be dealt with in time.
[03:04:04.240 --> 03:04:06.800]  But the reality is, is if you're buying a product
[03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:08.520]  that says the original Jack Herb,
[03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:09.760]  because there's only one,
[03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:16.160]  that it represents the ideas and the philosophy
[03:04:16.280 --> 03:04:19.040]  of how I was brought up and what I was taught
[03:04:19.040 --> 03:04:24.040]  and what this brand represents is this amazing community.
[03:04:25.400 --> 03:04:27.600]  Do you have any idea where,
[03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:29.840]  I take it your father had the best Jack Herb?
[03:04:31.280 --> 03:04:35.120]  Well, like any genetic, there are many,
[03:04:35.120 --> 03:04:37.280]  there are many phenotypes of Jack.
[03:04:39.560 --> 03:04:42.520]  For commercial production.
[03:04:42.520 --> 03:04:44.840]  He said, real Jack is unmistakable.
[03:04:44.840 --> 03:04:47.080]  I think you could co-sign that.
[03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:49.760]  Real Jack is unmistakable.
[03:04:49.760 --> 03:04:52.120]  And I'm hoping that you find that with our product
[03:04:52.120 --> 03:04:53.920]  branded the original Jack Herb.
[03:04:54.960 --> 03:04:57.920]  Outside of that, we do not release our genetics.
[03:04:57.920 --> 03:04:59.680]  We do not share our genetics.
[03:05:01.200 --> 03:05:05.800]  We protect them intensely.
[03:05:07.680 --> 03:05:11.640]  But we are looking to expand our phenotype offerings,
[03:05:12.680 --> 03:05:15.760]  at the consumer level over the next year or two years
[03:05:15.800 --> 03:05:19.000]  with things that we've been working on
[03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:22.160]  for almost a decade.
[03:05:22.160 --> 03:05:27.160]  And we're really gonna be excited
[03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:29.160]  when we're finally able to release that
[03:05:29.160 --> 03:05:31.800]  to the public for consumption.
[03:05:31.800 --> 03:05:36.800]  And that's what I can really say about that at this time.
[03:05:39.440 --> 03:05:40.360]  All right, one more.
[03:05:40.360 --> 03:05:43.160]  Is he developing an industrial hemp seed line?
[03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:45.680]  Already been done.
[03:05:46.720 --> 03:05:47.560]  Already been done.
[03:05:47.560 --> 03:05:48.480]  Already been done.
[03:05:51.320 --> 03:05:55.200]  It is not a fiber line at this point.
[03:05:55.200 --> 03:05:57.960]  It has a very, as you would know,
[03:05:57.960 --> 03:06:00.480]  a very unique Jack terpene profile.
[03:06:00.480 --> 03:06:03.920]  It is more on the consumable hemp,
[03:06:06.360 --> 03:06:10.800]  either unsmokable or consumables through CBD products
[03:06:10.840 --> 03:06:15.400]  that we'll also be releasing over the next 12 to 24 months.
[03:06:15.400 --> 03:06:19.360]  And it's taken a long time to really develop that genetic.
[03:06:21.360 --> 03:06:23.520]  Everything good requires time.
[03:06:23.520 --> 03:06:24.360]  Yep.
[03:06:25.600 --> 03:06:29.520]  Time, in some places it moves very, very fast.
[03:06:29.520 --> 03:06:34.520]  Like they say that life is a marathon, not a sprint.
[03:06:35.040 --> 03:06:39.840]  But in cannabis, that same thing happens
[03:06:39.880 --> 03:06:44.520]  except we're doing the marathon at a sprint pace.
[03:06:45.960 --> 03:06:47.680]  Because things are moving very, very fast.
[03:06:47.680 --> 03:06:51.520]  And we look at today as, if you're in cannabis,
[03:06:51.520 --> 03:06:53.440]  you're living in dog years
[03:06:53.440 --> 03:06:56.440]  because every year seems like seven.
[03:06:56.440 --> 03:07:00.000]  So today I'm 408 years old.
[03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:05.000]  And that's...
[03:07:05.360 --> 03:07:08.360]  So are you involved with the Jack Herricot?
[03:07:10.360 --> 03:07:13.360]  Well, I actually own the Jack Herricot.
[03:07:13.360 --> 03:07:14.200]  Yeah.
[03:07:14.200 --> 03:07:18.360]  But currently it is...
[03:07:20.360 --> 03:07:21.400]  It's been hiatus.
[03:07:21.400 --> 03:07:22.240]  Yeah.
[03:07:24.240 --> 03:07:25.640]  We'll leave that alone for right now.
[03:07:25.640 --> 03:07:26.480]  All right.
[03:07:28.200 --> 03:07:30.800]  Well, I know we don't wanna take up too much of your time.
[03:07:30.800 --> 03:07:33.200]  You have a big, beautiful booth upstairs.
[03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:36.320]  We appreciate you coming down and talking with us today.
[03:07:36.320 --> 03:07:38.000]  Anything else that you want the viewers to know
[03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.160]  about you or your brand or anything?
[03:07:40.160 --> 03:07:44.000]  Well, know that the brand represents the community.
[03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:47.120]  That it represents the very best in the ideas
[03:07:48.200 --> 03:07:51.400]  and intentions of my father,
[03:07:51.400 --> 03:07:54.000]  both in what the brand represents
[03:07:55.480 --> 03:08:00.480]  and its access to consumers.
[03:08:01.480 --> 03:08:05.480]  For me, I run the Jack Herricot Foundation.
[03:08:05.480 --> 03:08:08.280]  We try to come out to events like this.
[03:08:08.280 --> 03:08:13.280]  I'm lucky enough to be invited to speak
[03:08:14.560 --> 03:08:16.840]  to different people around the globe
[03:08:16.840 --> 03:08:21.480]  from Nepal to South America to Morocco
[03:08:21.480 --> 03:08:23.920]  and through Europe.
[03:08:23.920 --> 03:08:26.560]  And I've been able to spread the gospel
[03:08:26.560 --> 03:08:28.160]  of cannabis in a sense.
[03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:32.440]  And in some ways it helps a great deal
[03:08:32.440 --> 03:08:37.360]  because by sharing our history here in the United States
[03:08:37.360 --> 03:08:41.440]  and going back on how cannabis came to the United States,
[03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:44.960]  we're able to really show many countries
[03:08:44.960 --> 03:08:49.240]  that cannabis was part of their heritage too.
[03:08:49.240 --> 03:08:53.280]  This re-embracing and re-understanding of it is important.
[03:08:53.280 --> 03:08:56.280]  And the foundation helps to do that.
[03:08:56.280 --> 03:08:58.520]  So as we're raising money for the foundation
[03:08:58.520 --> 03:09:01.880]  through our golf tournaments or through events like this,
[03:09:01.880 --> 03:09:06.880]  we use that money in order to continue educating folks
[03:09:07.120 --> 03:09:09.600]  and do the best that we can.
[03:09:10.600 --> 03:09:13.280]  Cannabis is still a tough subject
[03:09:13.280 --> 03:09:15.640]  for a lot of people to deal with,
[03:09:15.640 --> 03:09:19.120]  but the truth of cannabis is very easy to process
[03:09:20.360 --> 03:09:22.840]  once you open up your mind just a little bit,
[03:09:22.840 --> 03:09:26.040]  just enough to put a question mark in your head
[03:09:26.800 --> 03:09:28.760]  because then once you start questioning things,
[03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:32.240]  you start generally finding out that maybe what you knew
[03:09:33.160 --> 03:09:35.240]  wasn't really what you should have known.
[03:09:35.240 --> 03:09:38.040]  And that this information that has been literally
[03:09:39.360 --> 03:09:44.000]  right under our noses for at least 35 years,
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:47.320]  and had we had the right textbooks as kids
[03:09:47.320 --> 03:09:50.160]  going through school and high school and college,
[03:09:50.160 --> 03:09:52.640]  that we wouldn't be so far behind the curve right now
[03:09:52.640 --> 03:09:54.840]  with our understanding of what it could be.
[03:09:55.680 --> 03:10:00.040]  And that's one of the things that I'm lucky enough
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:04.120]  to be able to continue to try to help move forward.
[03:10:06.280 --> 03:10:07.600]  Can we get a photo real quick?
[03:10:07.600 --> 03:10:10.280]  This was really enjoyable for me, man.
[03:10:10.280 --> 03:10:12.280]  Appreciate you taking your time to come down and talk to us.
[03:10:12.280 --> 03:10:13.120]  It was a great pleasure.
[03:10:13.120 --> 03:10:14.440]  Thank you for inviting me over.
[03:10:14.440 --> 03:10:15.680]  You got a photo real quick?
[03:10:15.680 --> 03:10:17.880]  I've been trying to get to meet you for a while.
[03:10:17.880 --> 03:10:19.240]  I think a lot of people...
[03:10:21.160 --> 03:10:23.120]  Well, it's really overrated.
[03:10:25.200 --> 03:10:26.040]  Thank you, Dan.
[03:10:26.040 --> 03:10:26.880]  We appreciate it.
[03:10:26.880 --> 03:10:27.720]  Thanks for having me.
[03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:32.080]  I got a random question for you.
[03:10:32.080 --> 03:10:32.920]  Sure.
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:36.960]  2010,
[03:10:38.200 --> 03:10:41.760]  at the Chance the Rage show in Las Vegas,
[03:10:41.760 --> 03:10:45.840]  Zong Class made 100 limited edition
[03:10:47.160 --> 03:10:49.480]  Jack Carrey Zong Bongs.
[03:10:49.480 --> 03:10:52.320]  And they made one special for your father.
[03:10:52.320 --> 03:10:53.200]  Do you remember that?
[03:10:53.240 --> 03:10:55.160]  Well, my father had...
[03:10:56.560 --> 03:11:01.280]  He was in the hospital in a coma from September of 09.
[03:11:01.280 --> 03:11:03.280]  So they may have made something
[03:11:03.280 --> 03:11:06.000]  and possibly given it to my father's widow.
[03:11:07.080 --> 03:11:10.840]  But it wasn't necessarily, obviously not given to him.
[03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:16.960]  Because we put my father to rest April 15th.
[03:11:17.960 --> 03:11:18.800]  Yeah.
[03:11:19.680 --> 03:11:20.520]  Yeah.
[03:11:20.520 --> 03:11:22.120]  So I just had one of those out of the way.
[03:11:22.240 --> 03:11:23.680]  You ever doubt that or not?
[03:11:23.680 --> 03:11:24.520]  No.
[03:11:26.160 --> 03:11:29.840]  There's a lot of folks that have done things
[03:11:29.840 --> 03:11:31.400]  out of the goodness of their heart
[03:11:31.400 --> 03:11:36.400]  because they felt really connected to my father in ways.
[03:11:38.760 --> 03:11:41.840]  People did make some limited edition products
[03:11:41.840 --> 03:11:46.200]  and then because of my father's influence in their lives.
[03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:49.640]  So I really don't know much about that particular type.
[03:11:50.480 --> 03:11:52.320]  Yeah, it was wonderful.
[03:11:54.960 --> 03:11:56.760]  And as far as the cup goes...
[03:13:22.560 --> 03:13:27.360]  ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

[03:16:52.010 --> 03:16:55.010]  We got Colorado Breeders Depot, he's just,
[03:16:55.010 --> 03:16:58.010]  everybody wants to obviously meet Dan today.
[03:16:58.010 --> 03:17:01.010]  He's over there talking to them.
[03:17:01.010 --> 03:17:03.010]  But look at this CBD boys.
[03:17:04.010 --> 03:17:05.010]  Purple.
[03:17:10.010 --> 03:17:13.010]  Hey Dan, it was really nice to meet you brother.
[03:17:13.010 --> 03:17:16.010]  Hey, are you running all the IG stuff?
[03:17:16.010 --> 03:17:18.010]  Are you behind all the IG stuff?
[03:17:20.010 --> 03:17:23.010]  All right, give him your IG and then I'll reach out to you.
[03:17:23.010 --> 03:17:25.010]  Or it's on there?
[03:17:27.010 --> 03:17:29.010]  Oh wait, there you go.
[03:17:29.010 --> 03:17:30.010]  All right.
[03:17:31.010 --> 03:17:32.010]  Let's do this.
[03:17:35.010 --> 03:17:37.010]  What's up Future Cannabis Project?
[03:17:37.010 --> 03:17:40.010]  Again, we are live all day with you guys.
[03:17:40.010 --> 03:17:42.010]  Just grabbed one of the head growers.
[03:17:42.010 --> 03:17:43.010]  I think you are the head grower actually.
[03:17:43.010 --> 03:17:45.010]  I don't want to misstep there, misspeak.
[03:17:45.010 --> 03:17:46.010]  I appreciate that.
[03:17:46.010 --> 03:17:49.010]  For Colorado, I know that's an earned position for sure.
[03:17:50.010 --> 03:17:51.010]  So let's talk about it.
[03:17:51.010 --> 03:17:54.010]  You know, there's a lot of CBD type hemp companies up there,
[03:17:54.010 --> 03:17:56.010]  but your company is standing out, sir.
[03:17:56.010 --> 03:17:58.010]  And I think part of it is because of the genetics
[03:17:58.010 --> 03:17:59.010]  that you're showing off today.
[03:18:00.010 --> 03:18:01.010]  I appreciate that.
[03:18:01.010 --> 03:18:03.010]  You know, we have a super passionate team.
[03:18:04.010 --> 03:18:07.010]  We like to bring out cannabis quality in hemp, right?
[03:18:07.010 --> 03:18:09.010]  I think that was missing for a long time.
[03:18:09.010 --> 03:18:12.010]  So being a breeder and a geneticist,
[03:18:12.010 --> 03:18:15.010]  we were able to breed specifically for certain programs,
[03:18:15.010 --> 03:18:18.010]  whether it be oil production or whatever is hot that year.
[03:18:18.010 --> 03:18:20.010]  Smogable flower came on strong.
[03:18:21.010 --> 03:18:23.010]  We started understanding, right?
[03:18:23.010 --> 03:18:26.010]  Back in the day when I was using cannabis medicinally,
[03:18:26.010 --> 03:18:28.010]  it was five, seven, 8%, right?
[03:18:28.010 --> 03:18:31.010]  It was a nice smoke, help with the pain, feel good, functioned.
[03:18:32.010 --> 03:18:34.010]  I love what we've done with THC marijuana now,
[03:18:34.010 --> 03:18:38.010]  but it's too strong for some people to be able to use it medicinally
[03:18:38.010 --> 03:18:39.010]  all day long, right?
[03:18:40.010 --> 03:18:42.010]  So a lot of people are turning to CBD and hemp.
[03:18:42.010 --> 03:18:45.010]  But what I found was the flavor profiles weren't there.
[03:18:45.010 --> 03:18:47.010]  The smells, the flavors, right?
[03:18:48.010 --> 03:18:51.010]  Us cannabis smokers, we love flavor profiles, right?
[03:18:52.010 --> 03:18:53.010]  Well said.
[03:18:53.010 --> 03:18:56.010]  I mean, so we just focused our breeding program
[03:18:56.010 --> 03:18:58.010]  into trying to make stuff taste and smell better,
[03:18:58.010 --> 03:19:02.010]  an enjoyable smoke and bringing indoor quality into the mix, right?
[03:19:02.010 --> 03:19:06.010]  Living soils, all organic nutrients, brewing teas.
[03:19:07.010 --> 03:19:09.010]  I feel like a lot of people aren't taking that step
[03:19:09.010 --> 03:19:12.010]  unless they're doing it for cannabis that's worth a lot more money.
[03:19:12.010 --> 03:19:15.010]  So we just decided to come into the market with quality.
[03:19:18.010 --> 03:19:19.010]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:19:20.010 --> 03:19:21.010]  My name is John Kalasinis.
[03:19:21.010 --> 03:19:24.010]  I'm one of the owners and partners here at Colorado Breeders Depot.
[03:19:25.010 --> 03:19:26.010]  This is one of our creations.
[03:19:27.010 --> 03:19:28.010]  That's our purple oracle.
[03:19:28.010 --> 03:19:30.010]  And what that is, is a purple Mendocino
[03:19:30.010 --> 03:19:35.010]  crossed with a purple abacus, F4 phenol.
[03:19:35.010 --> 03:19:38.010]  I don't even feel like that camera is really doing it justice.
[03:19:38.010 --> 03:19:39.010]  Yeah.
[03:19:41.010 --> 03:19:43.010]  And you know, there's not too many people down here
[03:19:43.010 --> 03:19:45.010]  with us in the dungeon today.
[03:19:45.010 --> 03:19:47.010]  So I can say this with full confidence.
[03:19:47.010 --> 03:19:50.010]  Most of the hemp that I see upstairs right now,
[03:19:50.010 --> 03:19:52.010]  everyone is brown as can be.
[03:19:53.010 --> 03:19:54.010]  Brown, brown, frown.
[03:19:55.010 --> 03:19:57.010]  So there's a lot of genetics out there.
[03:19:58.010 --> 03:19:59.010]  Genetics, that's something else.
[03:19:59.010 --> 03:20:01.010]  Maybe I should tell you, John, you know, our viewers here,
[03:20:01.010 --> 03:20:03.010]  we're really big on living soil.
[03:20:03.010 --> 03:20:05.010]  It's something that we actually talk about each and every Thursday.
[03:20:06.010 --> 03:20:07.010]  Amazing.
[03:20:07.010 --> 03:20:09.010]  And that's, you know, probably need to have you on the show.
[03:20:09.010 --> 03:20:10.010]  I would love to talk about that.
[03:20:10.010 --> 03:20:11.010]  It's a passion of mine.
[03:20:11.010 --> 03:20:12.010]  Right.
[03:20:12.010 --> 03:20:15.010]  And so what we talk about is how do we achieve the full genetic profile
[03:20:15.010 --> 03:20:16.010]  of what we're growing?
[03:20:16.010 --> 03:20:18.010]  And we feel like using living soils,
[03:20:18.010 --> 03:20:22.010]  using the microbial world, maybe you're familiar with the soil food web,
[03:20:22.010 --> 03:20:24.010]  Dr. Lainey, that kind of stuff.
[03:20:24.010 --> 03:20:27.010]  So how, you know, for our viewers out there,
[03:20:27.010 --> 03:20:29.010]  obviously you're using high quality genetics.
[03:20:29.010 --> 03:20:34.010]  And then how are you cultivating this to be able to achieve this color?
[03:20:35.010 --> 03:20:37.010]  It just really almost like bag of pill, if you will,
[03:20:37.010 --> 03:20:41.010]  from the cannabis side of things, because this really stands up, stands out.
[03:20:41.010 --> 03:20:44.010]  I assure you guys from everything else that's upstairs right now.
[03:20:44.010 --> 03:20:45.010]  Thank you.
[03:20:45.010 --> 03:20:46.010]  I really appreciate that.
[03:20:46.010 --> 03:20:50.010]  So one of the things we did is being in the cannabis space for a long time
[03:20:50.010 --> 03:20:51.010]  and then switching to CBD.
[03:20:52.010 --> 03:20:55.010]  One of the things we had to work with in the THC world was plant counts,
[03:20:55.010 --> 03:20:56.010]  a little restriction there.
[03:20:56.010 --> 03:20:57.010]  Right.
[03:20:57.010 --> 03:21:00.010]  So what I recognized is no plant count in my CBD world.
[03:21:00.010 --> 03:21:03.010]  So what I did is I went back to see greens,
[03:21:03.010 --> 03:21:07.010]  kind of like I started in this game, all single cola, top cola, premium nug.
[03:21:07.010 --> 03:21:09.010]  No middle of the plant, no bottom of the plant, right?
[03:21:09.010 --> 03:21:13.010]  Everything premium, getting the proper light exposure,
[03:21:13.010 --> 03:21:16.010]  the proper lumens across the board. Right.
[03:21:16.010 --> 03:21:22.010]  So just going for long-term quality and staying away from synthetic nutrients.
[03:21:22.010 --> 03:21:23.010]  Right. Amen.
[03:21:24.010 --> 03:21:27.010]  It comes back to indoor quality controlled rooms. Right.
[03:21:29.010 --> 03:21:32.010]  You know, staying preventative on things so you don't have problems,
[03:21:32.010 --> 03:21:34.010]  staying super organic in your methods.
[03:21:35.010 --> 03:21:37.010]  That's kind of just the way we started it. And we said, Hey,
[03:21:37.010 --> 03:21:41.010]  if we're going to run a smokable program for CBD, we'll take profit,
[03:21:41.010 --> 03:21:43.010]  profitability and set it aside for right now.
[03:21:44.010 --> 03:21:46.010]  And let's show people what it's supposed to be.
[03:21:46.010 --> 03:21:51.010]  And we believe that people will pay for the good, good grown medicine.
[03:21:51.010 --> 03:21:53.010]  Right. And if it's a little bit more expensive,
[03:21:53.010 --> 03:21:56.010]  but you're consuming it into your system, then it should matter.
[03:21:58.010 --> 03:22:00.010]  Seeing all this outdoor stuff getting smoked. You know,
[03:22:00.010 --> 03:22:04.010]  I have mixed feelings about that. Right.
[03:22:04.010 --> 03:22:07.010]  I am an outdoor farmer too, and we do grow for extraction,
[03:22:07.010 --> 03:22:10.010]  but I see a lot out there and I wouldn't consume that stuff personally.
[03:22:11.010 --> 03:22:15.010]  So we really focus on focus on just small batch stuff, greenhouse, indoor,
[03:22:16.010 --> 03:22:18.010]  and just keeping really strict programs, everything done by hand,
[03:22:18.010 --> 03:22:21.010]  nothing mechanized, right. All the way down to the trim job. Right.
[03:22:22.010 --> 03:22:25.010]  I want, I want my guys to touch the bud, feel the bud, hand water,
[03:22:26.010 --> 03:22:29.010]  walk through your room every day. Right. Look for issues.
[03:22:29.010 --> 03:22:33.010]  Make sure we're dialed in on temperatures, humidity, all that good stuff.
[03:22:33.010 --> 03:22:37.010]  No, no fluctuations up and down. Right. Consistently consistency.
[03:22:37.010 --> 03:22:39.010]  That's what, that's what plants want. That's what people want.
[03:22:39.010 --> 03:22:42.010]  We function better when we're consistent. So do our plants. Right.
[03:22:43.010 --> 03:22:46.010]  So just giving them a program and letting them tell you what they love.
[03:22:47.010 --> 03:22:49.010]  And then kind of just dialing in strain by strain.
[03:22:49.010 --> 03:22:52.010]  It's just been our, it's been our vision and the way we kind of grow anything.
[03:22:53.010 --> 03:22:56.010]  And are there any genetics you would love to co-sign for our viewers out there?
[03:22:57.010 --> 03:22:59.010]  You know, especially when you're newer to growing,
[03:22:59.010 --> 03:23:02.010]  you don't know certain genetics. I know I fell prey to this. You know,
[03:23:02.010 --> 03:23:04.010]  I spent two, maybe 300 bucks on a pack,
[03:23:05.010 --> 03:23:07.010]  took all the time to grow it out and now it hermit on me.
[03:23:07.010 --> 03:23:08.010]  That kind of bullshit. Right.
[03:23:08.010 --> 03:23:11.010]  So there's certain genetics that you rock with that are tried and true that you
[03:23:11.010 --> 03:23:14.010]  want to give to the viewers. I love that question.
[03:23:14.010 --> 03:23:18.010]  So the reason why we're growing smokable flower is we were always a genetics
[03:23:18.010 --> 03:23:21.010]  company first. Right. So this is proof of concept.
[03:23:22.010 --> 03:23:26.010]  So I would say nine out of 12 genetics that we're in-house bred and we run
[03:23:26.010 --> 03:23:28.010]  right now are available to the public.
[03:23:28.010 --> 03:23:32.010]  What I can tell you is we don't release anything to the public unless it's an F5
[03:23:32.010 --> 03:23:36.010]  or higher. So what I'm doing is phenol hunting, right?
[03:23:36.010 --> 03:23:39.010]  I'm doing my F1 cross at that point, the gene pool didn't open, right?
[03:23:39.010 --> 03:23:41.010]  Gene pool's opening at F2.
[03:23:42.010 --> 03:23:45.010]  That's when we're starting to see mother and father kind of become one.
[03:23:46.010 --> 03:23:49.010]  F3 is when we start stabilizing things, right?
[03:23:49.010 --> 03:23:52.010]  Picking out bad hermaphroditic phenotypes,
[03:23:53.010 --> 03:23:55.010]  bad yielding phenotypes, whatever we want.
[03:23:55.010 --> 03:23:58.010]  And then what we do from that F3 point is we go to an S cross,
[03:23:59.010 --> 03:24:02.010]  which means I take one specific phenotype that is the most stable,
[03:24:02.010 --> 03:24:05.010]  gives us the color we want, the ratios we want.
[03:24:05.010 --> 03:24:07.010]  And then I start S crossing that for stability.
[03:24:08.010 --> 03:24:12.010]  So any genetics that we release online will be at least fifth generation.
[03:24:13.010 --> 03:24:16.010]  You'll notice pretty much dominant one phenotype in the whole entire batch,
[03:24:16.010 --> 03:24:20.010]  unless I chose to leave two dominant phenotypes in there for specific reasons.
[03:24:20.010 --> 03:24:21.010]  We can talk about that.
[03:24:23.010 --> 03:24:26.010]  And yeah, we just, again, we'll grow it.
[03:24:26.010 --> 03:24:28.010]  We make sure we run it. We make sure it's ready.
[03:24:29.010 --> 03:24:32.010]  We won't release any genetics to the public unless it's stable, stable, stable.
[03:24:33.010 --> 03:24:36.010]  Sunset Sherbert is really one of our bangers,
[03:24:36.010 --> 03:24:40.010]  especially for the new coming grower. It's one phenovariation.
[03:24:41.010 --> 03:24:43.010]  She's really fast finishing at about day 50,
[03:24:43.010 --> 03:24:48.010]  puts on a ton of trichomes hitting almost 20% on day 50 CBD.
[03:24:49.010 --> 03:24:50.010]  And it's an easy grow, right?
[03:24:50.010 --> 03:24:53.010]  If you're that novice grower and your room's a little unstable,
[03:24:53.010 --> 03:24:55.010]  she will not hurt me. She will take abuse.
[03:24:55.010 --> 03:24:59.010]  Powdery mildew resistant, mold resistant, really, really impressive. Right?
[03:24:59.010 --> 03:25:02.010]  So I'd say the Sunset Sherbert, I believe she's at F7 now.
[03:25:02.010 --> 03:25:05.010]  We took her all the way to seven. She's just ready to go.
[03:25:05.010 --> 03:25:09.010]  I would tell even people for outdoor smogable farms with crazy weather,
[03:25:09.010 --> 03:25:11.010]  put her out there and she'll perform. Right?
[03:25:11.010 --> 03:25:15.010]  So she's an exciting one. Purple Urkel, she's only at F3 right now.
[03:25:16.010 --> 03:25:19.010]  We won't release her probably till Christmas time when she's a little more
[03:25:19.010 --> 03:25:22.010]  stable. So I can assure you that any genetics we release online,
[03:25:22.010 --> 03:25:23.010]  she's a little more stable.
[03:25:23.010 --> 03:25:27.010]  So I can assure you that any genetics we sell to the public will be an easy
[03:25:27.010 --> 03:25:28.010]  grow, a stable grow.
[03:25:29.010 --> 03:25:33.010]  And it'll give you the terpene profiles and CBD production you want out of a
[03:25:33.010 --> 03:25:35.010]  plant. You know what I mean? Plus we're,
[03:25:35.010 --> 03:25:37.010]  our customer service is one of the things I'm most proud of.
[03:25:38.010 --> 03:25:41.010]  Like when you call our company, man, it's everything for us.
[03:25:41.010 --> 03:25:44.010]  We looked at the one thing lacking in this industry and it's customer service.
[03:25:44.010 --> 03:25:47.010]  Everyone's there to make a sale, but when things go wrong,
[03:25:47.010 --> 03:25:50.010]  all of a sudden it's hard to get back. Right? We just don't do that.
[03:25:50.010 --> 03:25:53.010]  You get me on the phone, right? When you call, you call our company,
[03:25:53.010 --> 03:25:54.010]  you talk to the master grower.
[03:25:54.010 --> 03:25:57.010]  I can assure you there is nobody that understands these strains better than me.
[03:25:58.010 --> 03:26:00.010]  And if you fail, we fail. Right?
[03:26:01.010 --> 03:26:02.010]  Hey Brian, let's take a look at the screen.
[03:26:04.010 --> 03:26:07.010]  Oh, what's your company IG? I believe it would just be Colorado breeders.
[03:26:07.010 --> 03:26:10.010]  It's Colorado underscore breeders, underscore Depot.
[03:26:12.010 --> 03:26:14.010]  Thank you so much. Check us out on our Instagram.
[03:26:14.010 --> 03:26:16.010]  You can see a lot of our indoor stuff that we're doing.
[03:26:16.010 --> 03:26:17.010]  You'll see some of our greenhouses on there.
[03:26:18.010 --> 03:26:21.010]  We try to stay pretty educative on the, on the Instagram forefront too.
[03:26:22.010 --> 03:26:23.010]  We definitely do answer.
[03:26:23.010 --> 03:26:27.010]  If you have questions about our growing methods or what we're doing, write us.
[03:26:27.010 --> 03:26:28.010]  We'll get right back to you. Right?
[03:26:29.010 --> 03:26:33.010]  We're always there to talk to our, our growers, our clients, our, our,
[03:26:33.010 --> 03:26:35.010]  our users and smokers. Right?
[03:26:36.010 --> 03:26:38.010]  It's just a big family and we want you to succeed.
[03:26:39.010 --> 03:26:40.010]  And we want to kind of go through this together.
[03:26:41.010 --> 03:26:44.010]  And I just want to see better CBD smokable butt out there.
[03:26:44.010 --> 03:26:45.010]  I think it has a place to stay.
[03:26:45.010 --> 03:26:48.010]  Absolutely. My girl is like, she's in the medical field.
[03:26:48.010 --> 03:26:50.010]  She's not able to smoke THC, but she loves smoking.
[03:26:51.010 --> 03:26:54.010]  Yeah. You know, it just kind of gives you that still like you're relaxed,
[03:26:54.010 --> 03:26:58.010]  but you're not almost got a ritual feeling. Yes. Yes. Yes. Right.
[03:26:58.010 --> 03:27:00.010]  Like again, like back in the day, I remember smoking cannabis.
[03:27:01.010 --> 03:27:05.010]  It was a different experience and it is now. So I like both, right.
[03:27:05.010 --> 03:27:07.010]  There's there's sometimes you want stronger medicine.
[03:27:07.010 --> 03:27:08.010]  Sometimes you want it a little more East.
[03:27:09.010 --> 03:27:12.010]  So I think CBD makes a good play for either mixing things 50 50,
[03:27:12.010 --> 03:27:15.010]  or smoking your CBD during the day and enjoying your THC a little more at
[03:27:15.010 --> 03:27:16.010]  night when you're not functioning as much.
[03:27:17.010 --> 03:27:19.010]  So we're really excited to just keep developing strains.
[03:27:20.010 --> 03:27:23.010]  Keep building our name and reputation and client base and following.
[03:27:24.010 --> 03:27:27.010]  And any customers out there again, please reach out anytime.
[03:27:27.010 --> 03:27:28.010]  We always love to talk to you guys.
[03:27:29.010 --> 03:27:32.010]  We're nothing without the people that follow us and support us.
[03:27:33.010 --> 03:27:35.010]  So literally we're here for you, right?
[03:27:36.010 --> 03:27:38.010]  You'd be surprised if you just reach out to us and we're here for you.
[03:27:38.010 --> 03:27:39.010]  How in depth we get with our clients.
[03:27:40.010 --> 03:27:42.010]  We really get in there because at the end of the day,
[03:27:43.010 --> 03:27:45.010]  you're representing our genetics and your success is our success.
[03:27:46.010 --> 03:27:47.010]  Plus we want good medicine.
[03:27:48.010 --> 03:27:50.010]  We want it at a good price and we need that quality there.
[03:27:51.010 --> 03:27:52.010]  You know, I feel like you have a team.
[03:27:53.010 --> 03:27:55.010]  We used to have a team back in the day that had this model as a group.
[03:27:56.010 --> 03:27:59.010]  And we would always say to each other, the only business is repeat business.
[03:28:00.010 --> 03:28:02.010]  And I feel like you're one of the first people that feel like it's,
[03:28:03.010 --> 03:28:05.010]  you know, for the most part, getting the most out of it.
[03:28:05.010 --> 03:28:06.010]  And for you to say customer service, man,
[03:28:07.010 --> 03:28:08.010]  I hope that a lot of you guys check him out.
[03:28:09.010 --> 03:28:11.010]  You have how many facilities here in Denver?
[03:28:12.010 --> 03:28:15.010]  So right now we have a 124,000 indoor square foot facility
[03:28:16.010 --> 03:28:19.010]  and we're running about 60,000 square foot of greenhouse spread out around Colorado.
[03:28:20.010 --> 03:28:21.010]  And then we do do things out of state.
[03:28:22.010 --> 03:28:23.010]  We're operating in 12 different states right now.
[03:28:24.010 --> 03:28:27.010]  Wow. So we're always interested in partnerships with good people that want to grow.
[03:28:28.010 --> 03:28:30.010]  You know, talking about getting the best out of the state.
[03:28:31.010 --> 03:28:33.010]  We're always interested in partnerships with good people that want to grow.
[03:28:33.010 --> 03:28:35.010]  You know, talking about getting the right genetics in,
[03:28:36.010 --> 03:28:38.010]  putting the right programs in, being a support system for each other
[03:28:39.010 --> 03:28:40.010]  and getting good price product out to the market.
[03:28:41.010 --> 03:28:42.010]  Right. That's kind of everything.
[03:28:43.010 --> 03:28:44.010]  So we're always up for joint ventures.
[03:28:45.010 --> 03:28:47.010]  We're always up to help whether we're, you know, if you're just a client or a partner,
[03:28:48.010 --> 03:28:49.010]  it doesn't matter for us. You're a partner.
[03:28:50.010 --> 03:28:51.010]  Always. Right.
[03:28:52.010 --> 03:28:54.010]  We're all speaking for each other and we're in this together. Right.
[03:28:55.010 --> 03:28:59.010]  We're in ground zero. So what we do here 20 years from now is going to really matter.
[03:28:59.010 --> 03:29:03.010]  Right. So I think I think I'm really proud of where this industry has gone.
[03:29:04.010 --> 03:29:08.010]  We have some really great growers on the floor focusing on CBD,
[03:29:09.010 --> 03:29:10.010]  not just from our team, other teams out there, too. Right.
[03:29:11.010 --> 03:29:13.010]  And we support all other good businesses, too. Right.
[03:29:14.010 --> 03:29:16.010]  There's just love. That's what this is about.
[03:29:17.010 --> 03:29:20.010]  Good medicine, good price, good love and families.
[03:29:21.010 --> 03:29:24.010]  Right. Sticking together and making this thing right for the people,
[03:29:25.010 --> 03:29:26.010]  our children and our children's children.
[03:29:26.010 --> 03:29:27.010]  They're going to enjoy this stuff. They're going to benefit.
[03:29:28.010 --> 03:29:31.010]  So one of the last things, brother, we're really known on Thursdays.
[03:29:32.010 --> 03:29:35.010]  We we have a guest each week and those guests come on and give kind of like gold nuggets.
[03:29:36.010 --> 03:29:39.010]  Is there one or two gold nuggets that you could feel from the cultivation side
[03:29:40.010 --> 03:29:43.010]  that you feel like you could give to the viewers producing some of the best CBD,
[03:29:44.010 --> 03:29:46.010]  brother, that I've seen here at the show?
[03:29:47.010 --> 03:29:50.010]  Man, I mean, you know, there's a thousand ways to skin a cat. Right.
[03:29:51.010 --> 03:29:53.010]  There's a lot of different ways to run a program.
[03:29:53.010 --> 03:29:57.010]  But, you know, controlled environments, I just can't explain.
[03:29:58.010 --> 03:30:00.010]  Like everyone's in a rush to fill their growing room with plants.
[03:30:01.010 --> 03:30:04.010]  How controlled your environment is. Don't don't forget CO2.
[03:30:05.010 --> 03:30:06.010]  Right. Water and light.
[03:30:07.010 --> 03:30:11.010]  People are moving so fast, focus on nutrients and focused on microbials
[03:30:12.010 --> 03:30:14.010]  and building their, you know, building everything right.
[03:30:15.010 --> 03:30:18.010]  But at the end of the day, we're forgetting little things like, hey,
[03:30:19.010 --> 03:30:22.010]  are my lumens right in my room or, you know, am I, am I, am I,
[03:30:23.010 --> 03:30:25.010]  am I trying to know, am I using good water? Right.
[03:30:26.010 --> 03:30:29.010]  The little things in most rows that I go into that need help.
[03:30:30.010 --> 03:30:32.010]  I assure you, it's not the nutrients they're using.
[03:30:33.010 --> 03:30:36.010]  In most cases, it's the lack of the little details.
[03:30:37.010 --> 03:30:40.010]  If you want to grow fire, it's the little things. It's not the big.
[03:30:41.010 --> 03:30:43.010]  It's the little things that matter.
[03:30:44.010 --> 03:30:46.010]  Little things you'd never expect. That'd be my biggest advice.
[03:30:47.010 --> 03:30:49.010]  And then we can get really deep into a 20 hour conversation.
[03:30:49.010 --> 03:30:54.010]  Right. But a tight program. Notice the little things. Pay attention.
[03:30:55.010 --> 03:30:58.010]  Look around. Right. Be aware of your facility.
[03:30:59.010 --> 03:31:01.010]  It's it's easy if you make it easy.
[03:31:02.010 --> 03:31:03.010]  Well said.
[03:31:04.010 --> 03:31:05.010]  I believe it. Right. I believe it.
[03:31:06.010 --> 03:31:10.010]  Most of the problems I find in grow rooms are so minute that people can't
[03:31:11.010 --> 03:31:12.010]  even believe there was that one little thing. Right.
[03:31:13.010 --> 03:31:14.010]  They're looking at the bigger things.
[03:31:15.010 --> 03:31:17.010]  Oh, you don't have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce
[03:31:17.010 --> 03:31:21.010]  good cannabis. Have a tight program. Stick to it. Listen to your plants.
[03:31:22.010 --> 03:31:24.010]  They're talking to you every day. Those leaves are telling you what's up.
[03:31:25.010 --> 03:31:29.010]  Listen. Right. Just like raising children. Listen. Be involved. Pay attention.
[03:31:30.010 --> 03:31:33.010]  Absentee parenting doesn't work. Absentee growing doesn't work.
[03:31:34.010 --> 03:31:36.010]  Be in your room, man. I never tell anything.
[03:31:37.010 --> 03:31:40.010]  Well, you know, a lot of those guys always talk about automation, automation.
[03:31:41.010 --> 03:31:42.010]  I hate that. Oh, God.
[03:31:43.010 --> 03:31:44.010]  You're going to have a heart attack right now just thinking about it.
[03:31:44.010 --> 03:31:46.010]  I mean, you know, nine out of ten times you go, well,
[03:31:47.010 --> 03:31:49.010]  how many plants are you cultivating? You look at you. Right. Right.
[03:31:50.010 --> 03:31:53.010]  Right. Right. Right. Now that makes automation is the best way to go.
[03:31:54.010 --> 03:31:56.010]  Plug and play. You want to see you got run out of a room real quick.
[03:31:57.010 --> 03:31:59.010]  Say plug and play to me. Fix it and leave it or whatever.
[03:32:00.010 --> 03:32:02.010]  No, be involved. Be involved in your children's life.
[03:32:03.010 --> 03:32:04.010]  Be involved in your plants life.
[03:32:05.010 --> 03:32:07.010]  So Andy has a question for you.
[03:32:10.010 --> 03:32:12.010]  OK, so this cross right here, it's a great question.
[03:32:12.010 --> 03:32:15.010]  Excuse me. This is a purple Mendocino phenol hunted,
[03:32:16.010 --> 03:32:18.010]  crossed with a purple abacus phenol hunted.
[03:32:19.010 --> 03:32:20.010]  We've been working on it for three years.
[03:32:21.010 --> 03:32:27.010]  Yeah, it was in Gen three is when it really stabilized and exploded.
[03:32:28.010 --> 03:32:30.010]  Believe it or not, in Gen two, we almost dropped the strain
[03:32:31.010 --> 03:32:33.010]  because of the extreme amalgamation.
[03:32:34.010 --> 03:32:37.010]  It just went crazy on us as soon as the gene pool opened for whatever reason.
[03:32:38.010 --> 03:32:40.010]  And then we went one more round on an F2.
[03:32:40.010 --> 03:32:43.010]  And then we went one more round on an F cross and things just stapled out.
[03:32:44.010 --> 03:32:50.010]  The purple got right. Our CBDs went over 20 percent from like 12 on the Gen two run.
[03:32:51.010 --> 03:32:53.010]  Yeah, it just took sometimes that'll happen. You know what I mean?
[03:32:54.010 --> 03:32:58.010]  So we actually we almost gave up on the purple oracle, but we brought her back.
[03:32:59.010 --> 03:33:01.010]  And she turns out to be one of our pride and joys. For sure.
[03:33:02.010 --> 03:33:06.010]  That's a great question. And we always tell everyone our phenotypes and breeds.
[03:33:06.010 --> 03:33:15.010]  Do F1 hybrids, F1s or work lines.
[03:33:16.010 --> 03:33:20.010]  They do. OK, so we are so we're doing F1 hybrids.
[03:33:21.010 --> 03:33:27.010]  So our F crosses, we're generally doing F1 F crosses.
[03:33:28.010 --> 03:33:32.010]  And we'll probably go F crossing until Generation three, usually or four.
[03:33:32.010 --> 03:33:37.010]  And then we go on to S cross for stabilization, stabilization and seed production.
[03:33:38.010 --> 03:33:42.010]  We played with some R crosses, too, but it really depends on the genetics and what it's kind of showing us
[03:33:43.010 --> 03:33:44.010]  and how we'll kind of cross from there.
[03:33:45.010 --> 03:33:49.010]  But we do like to take two different parents from totally different lineages.
[03:33:50.010 --> 03:33:53.010]  So true hybrids and kind of see what happens. You know what I mean?
[03:33:54.010 --> 03:33:58.010]  Now we will take two phenotypes of cherry and stabilize that way, too.
[03:33:59.010 --> 03:34:04.010]  Like our cherry wine is an F9 now. We didn't do hybrid crossing on that.
[03:34:05.010 --> 03:34:06.010]  We stayed in the lineage the whole way through.
[03:34:07.010 --> 03:34:14.010]  But if you want that, like we feel that if you want that, like out of control, totally different than what we've seen,
[03:34:15.010 --> 03:34:17.010]  do some hybrid crossing. It is a little trickier.
[03:34:18.010 --> 03:34:21.010]  They don't all take well, but we do like to kind of play with it.
[03:34:22.010 --> 03:34:24.010]  We're always thinking outside the box. We don't always play it safe.
[03:34:25.010 --> 03:34:26.010]  You know what I mean?
[03:34:27.010 --> 03:34:29.010]  And that's the reason why you're going to have genetics that are standing out.
[03:34:30.010 --> 03:34:31.010]  Yeah, that's what we're shooting for.
[03:34:32.010 --> 03:34:36.010]  So I'd say half our genetics are internal crosses. The other half, our genetics are hybrid.
[03:34:37.010 --> 03:34:42.010]  The ones that we're shooting for home runs or long end zone passes, that's our hybrid F1 crosses.
[03:34:43.010 --> 03:34:47.010]  So if you guys have any other questions, otherwise, I'm going to let John go back up there.
[03:34:48.010 --> 03:34:49.010]  They have a fantastic booth.
[03:34:50.010 --> 03:34:53.010]  You guys got a whole crew up there almost mobbing deep here at the NOCO event.
[03:34:54.010 --> 03:34:56.010]  So shout out to your entire team up there.
[03:34:57.010 --> 03:35:01.010]  Thank you so much. We really appreciate you guys for getting the word out and getting the industry informed.
[03:35:02.010 --> 03:35:09.010]  It's so important. Without guys like you spreading the word and telling the truth about everything that's happened in this industry and keeping it real,
[03:35:10.010 --> 03:35:12.010]  this industry would be a bunch of smoke and mirrors, which is what we don't want.
[03:35:13.010 --> 03:35:19.010]  So putting people in the light and interviewing and educating our consumers is the best thing that could happen in this game.
[03:35:20.010 --> 03:35:22.010]  And it wouldn't happen without guys like you. So we appreciate you very much.
[03:35:22.010 --> 03:35:25.010]  Now that we've met, bro, I have no doubt that we're going to be in touch.
[03:35:26.010 --> 03:35:27.010]  We'd love to have you on the show.
[03:35:28.010 --> 03:35:33.010]  Anytime. I would love to just sit down and talk to our viewers out there and keep educating. That would be my pleasure.
[03:35:34.010 --> 03:35:35.010]  Any other questions?
[03:35:36.010 --> 03:35:42.010]  Just for me, what are some of the breeding projects you're working on right now and what are your goals with those projects?
[03:35:43.010 --> 03:35:50.010]  When your internal team talks, what do you guys dork out on in terms of what you're working on?
[03:35:50.010 --> 03:35:55.010]  Great questions also. And those conversations are fun, fun, fun, man. We're always thinking outside the box.
[03:35:56.010 --> 03:36:02.010]  I mean, obviously we're still going down that rabbit hole of 0% THC, really high quality CBD.
[03:36:03.010 --> 03:36:06.010]  Some of the people upstairs, the reason for that shit.
[03:36:07.010 --> 03:36:08.010]  Yeah, exactly. Right.
[03:36:09.010 --> 03:36:10.010]  I walked by one. I was like, man.
[03:36:11.010 --> 03:36:14.010]  Even like 0.2% EU compliant. We're really working on that.
[03:36:15.010 --> 03:36:18.010]  I keep telling people all the time, you don't want to eat an unripe tomato.
[03:36:18.010 --> 03:36:24.010]  You don't want to smoke an unripe fruit or flower. It's just, you know what I mean? It's just not going to be there.
[03:36:25.010 --> 03:36:27.010]  So we're really putting a lot of work into that.
[03:36:28.010 --> 03:36:35.010]  We're putting a lot of work into producing really high quality, really cheap, feminized seed for our outdoor oil production farmers.
[03:36:36.010 --> 03:36:40.010]  What I want to try to do is create a program where we can farm for a thousand dollars or less.
[03:36:40.010 --> 03:36:48.010]  Genetics, farming, harvesting, out the door, pull a couple thousand pounds and make some really good oil production.
[03:36:49.010 --> 03:36:52.010]  So it's on guys like us to make really good seed, really cheap.
[03:36:53.010 --> 03:36:58.010]  So that's the main focus of ours. We are playing with some CBN stuff. That's really exciting.
[03:36:59.010 --> 03:37:02.010]  We have a couple of CBN genetics that we'll be releasing probably around Christmas time.
[03:37:03.010 --> 03:37:06.010]  And stabilizing CBG. CBG was an interesting thing last year.
[03:37:06.010 --> 03:37:12.010]  So we're working on probably 12 different CBG strains with really good terpene profiles.
[03:37:13.010 --> 03:37:15.010]  And we will have the first purple CBG coming out really, really soon.
[03:37:16.010 --> 03:37:18.010]  It's an insane flower to smoke.
[03:37:19.010 --> 03:37:24.010]  So those are a few that we have in the bank. But right now we're doing about 37 different crossbreeding programs.
[03:37:25.010 --> 03:37:26.010]  Still keep pushing and pushing.
[03:37:27.010 --> 03:37:32.010]  But if we have any requests on what people want to see, we'd love that too. We're all ears.
[03:37:33.010 --> 03:37:36.010]  I'm looking for concentrate like that. Have you ever seen stuff like that?
[03:37:37.010 --> 03:37:39.010]  Sure. Does your team make stuff like that?
[03:37:40.010 --> 03:37:42.010]  Is this CBD? Yeah. It smells like honey.
[03:37:43.010 --> 03:37:44.010]  It's the terp for it.
[03:37:45.010 --> 03:37:46.010]  It smells so good.
[03:37:47.010 --> 03:37:48.010]  Is your team on that?
[03:37:49.010 --> 03:37:53.010]  So we can do a lot of extracts. The problem is keeping it THC compliant.
[03:37:54.010 --> 03:37:58.010]  So then what we're doing is we're not really kind of extracting the way we should.
[03:37:58.010 --> 03:38:02.010]  We're going backwards. We're going to like an isolate or a distillate and then crashing back.
[03:38:03.010 --> 03:38:06.010]  I'm not really into that. I don't even like solvents.
[03:38:07.010 --> 03:38:08.010]  You don't even like bologna to steak?
[03:38:09.010 --> 03:38:11.010]  You know what I mean? I would love to make steak out of bologna. That would be awesome actually.
[03:38:12.010 --> 03:38:18.010]  So yeah, we can probably do it. But we're focused more just on the flowers right now and natural extracts.
[03:38:19.010 --> 03:38:23.010]  But you know, that smells. I would love to try that.
[03:38:24.010 --> 03:38:25.010]  I have a utility that smells fire.
[03:38:25.010 --> 03:38:27.010]  So right now that's not really our specialty.
[03:38:28.010 --> 03:38:33.010]  Our extraction is more just oil extraction for both crude or burnt distillate or bulk isolate.
[03:38:34.010 --> 03:38:35.010]  We do a lot of bubble hash stuff.
[03:38:36.010 --> 03:38:38.010]  But again, compliancy is where we run into trouble there without crashing back.
[03:38:39.010 --> 03:38:41.010]  So we try to keep things just natural.
[03:38:42.010 --> 03:38:43.010]  Right.
[03:38:44.010 --> 03:38:51.480]  Yes. Yes. So we do phytosanitary. We ship seeds all over the country.
[03:38:52.480 --> 03:38:53.480]  We do have a warehouse in Switzerland.
[03:38:53.480 --> 03:38:55.480]  So we can service the EU too.
[03:38:56.480 --> 03:39:00.480]  If you just call in at our company, we can walk you through the process. It's pretty quick.
[03:39:01.480 --> 03:39:03.480]  We handle customs. We handle phytosanitary.
[03:39:04.480 --> 03:39:07.480]  We can get it shipped pretty much to any country depending on your import.
[03:39:08.480 --> 03:39:14.480]  We'll work with you on every order though to help you with your import paperwork and our export paperwork working together.
[03:39:15.480 --> 03:39:16.480]  But we do ship all over the globe.
[03:39:17.480 --> 03:39:19.480]  You're a hit and jet bro to be honest.
[03:39:20.480 --> 03:39:21.480]  I don't know how we don't know each other.
[03:39:21.480 --> 03:39:27.480]  I don't know. I don't get out of the warehouse much. I'll tell you that. That's the problem. I stay in there.
[03:39:28.480 --> 03:39:31.480]  I kind of had a pivot I guess in some of the things. We're doing a lot more media than we were.
[03:39:32.480 --> 03:39:33.480]  I've been farming for a long time myself.
[03:39:34.480 --> 03:39:38.480]  Now that I was out in Oklahoma for a little bit, I wasn't able to move out there.
[03:39:39.480 --> 03:39:40.480]  I got a stepson and that kind of thing.
[03:39:41.480 --> 03:39:46.480]  So the ways that things have kind of taken forth, I'm glad that we can promote a guy like you.
[03:39:47.480 --> 03:39:48.480]  I appreciate it very much, man.
[03:39:48.480 --> 03:39:52.480]  Any exposure or anything to promote our company, it's a big deal for us.
[03:39:53.480 --> 03:39:55.480]  We love our customers and we love the people we work with.
[03:39:56.480 --> 03:39:59.480]  We're always here, man. It's a big family. It's a big team.
[03:40:00.480 --> 03:40:01.480]  We're going to win together or fail together. Period.
[03:40:02.480 --> 03:40:06.480]  I can definitely say that it's a big family because they got a big team upstairs.
[03:40:07.480 --> 03:40:12.480]  A lot of passion going on, man. A lot of passion. We believe. We believe, man. This is it.
[03:40:13.480 --> 03:40:17.480]  All right. Well, thank you, John. I'm going to go back upstairs and grab another fantastic individual.
[03:40:18.480 --> 03:40:19.480]  So you guys hang tight.
[03:40:20.480 --> 03:40:22.480]  Guys, thank you so much. I appreciate everybody. Everybody stay blessed.
[03:40:23.480 --> 03:40:24.480]  Awesome. Thank you so much.
[03:40:25.480 --> 03:40:26.480]  You're a natural at that.
[03:40:27.480 --> 03:40:28.480]  You're good.
[03:41:05.300 --> 03:41:06.300]  Is this your phone over here?
[03:41:07.300 --> 03:41:08.300]  Hey!
[03:42:18.110 --> 03:42:19.110]  Na na na.
[03:43:01.000 --> 03:43:02.000]  Na na na.
[03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:09.720]  Merci beaucoup. Merci beaucoup.
[03:43:10.720 --> 03:43:11.720]  Thank you. Thank you very much.
[03:43:11.720 --> 03:43:12.720]  Merci beaucoup. Thank you very much.
[03:43:17.720 --> 03:43:18.720]  Merci.
[03:43:19.720 --> 03:43:20.720]  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
[03:43:23.720 --> 03:43:25.720]  This one, fantastic. Follow the rainbow.
[03:43:27.720 --> 03:43:29.720]  One, two, three and four.
[03:43:30.720 --> 03:43:32.720]  I'm following the rain, the rain.
[03:43:37.620 --> 03:43:50.980]  There's a path that goes way to elsewhere.
[03:43:51.980 --> 03:44:12.720]  Narrow is the way to nowhere.
[03:44:13.720 --> 03:44:22.350]  If I share the road, it may be rugged and stiff.
[03:44:23.350 --> 03:44:25.350]  But I'm looking at people.
[03:44:26.350 --> 03:44:29.350]  What is the chance? Can I be put on?
[03:44:30.350 --> 03:44:39.640]  What is the hurry? Can I be put on?
[03:44:39.640 --> 03:44:41.640]  What is the chance? Can I be put on?
[03:44:42.640 --> 03:44:44.640]  What is the hurry? Can I be put on?
[03:44:45.640 --> 03:44:47.640]  What is the mark? Can I be put on?
[03:44:48.640 --> 03:44:49.640]  I just want you to know.
[03:44:50.640 --> 03:44:52.640]  What is the right? Can I be put on?
[03:44:53.640 --> 03:44:56.640]  I'm following the rain, the rain.
[03:44:57.640 --> 03:45:00.640]  There's a path that goes way to elsewhere.
[03:45:41.500 --> 03:45:46.480]  Narrow is the way to nowhere.
[03:45:47.480 --> 03:45:50.480]  If I share the road, it may be rugged and stiff.
[03:45:51.480 --> 03:45:57.120]  Narrow is the way to nowhere.
[03:45:58.120 --> 03:46:08.720]  If I share the road, it may be rugged and stiff.
[03:46:09.720 --> 03:46:11.720]  But I'm looking at people.
[03:46:12.720 --> 03:46:14.720]  What is the chance? Can I be put on?
[03:46:15.720 --> 03:46:18.720]  What is the hurry? Can I be put on?
[03:46:19.720 --> 03:46:21.720]  What is the mark? Can I be put on?
[03:46:22.720 --> 03:46:24.720]  I just want you to know.
[03:46:25.720 --> 03:46:27.720]  What is the right? Can I be put on?
[03:46:28.720 --> 03:46:31.720]  I'm following the rain, the rain.
[03:46:32.720 --> 03:46:46.430]  All right, Peter.
[03:46:47.430 --> 03:46:50.430]  Everyone's requesting that you guys dance before we get started.
[03:46:51.430 --> 03:46:52.430]  All right.
[03:46:53.430 --> 03:46:54.430]  All of it, and you guys can mess up.
[03:46:54.430 --> 03:46:55.430]  Okay.
[03:46:55.430 --> 03:46:56.430]  You're welcome.
[03:46:58.430 --> 03:47:00.430]  He's literally like, going around something.
[03:47:00.430 --> 03:47:01.430]  Yeah, we're safe.
[03:47:02.430 --> 03:47:03.430]  Don't want to infect everyone.
[03:47:04.430 --> 03:47:05.430]  We're vaccinated, so it doesn't matter.
[03:47:06.430 --> 03:47:07.430]  I have immunity.
[03:47:07.430 --> 03:47:08.430]  That's it.
[03:47:09.430 --> 03:47:12.430]  All right. So you know, our viewers are Living Soil enthusiasts.
[03:47:12.430 --> 03:47:17.230]  You guys are upstairs in a beautiful booth talking about living soils.
[03:47:17.230 --> 03:47:20.550]  You guys obviously are selling a living soil.
[03:47:20.550 --> 03:47:26.230]  Let's kind of talk about your company and what's making you different from a soil producer.
[03:47:26.230 --> 03:47:27.230]  Yeah, thanks.
[03:47:27.230 --> 03:47:36.270]  So basically, really, we start with our compost and that compost is different from a lot of
[03:47:36.270 --> 03:47:39.630]  other compost because we don't windrow turn it.
[03:47:39.630 --> 03:47:45.910]  We use loader when we do turn it and whenever we can, we use blowers to aerate it.
[03:47:45.910 --> 03:47:53.310]  And so that ends with a lot more of a fungal organism profile, not just a bacterial profile.
[03:47:53.310 --> 03:47:59.990]  So I would say that's the base of what sets us apart is our fungally balanced compost.
[03:47:59.990 --> 03:48:03.590]  And then we got really into this guy, William Albrecht, who's a soil scientist from the
[03:48:03.590 --> 03:48:05.790]  30s and 40s.
[03:48:05.790 --> 03:48:10.770]  And he has a set of ratios that he came up with doing soil science.
[03:48:10.770 --> 03:48:14.710]  And it was really fascinating for me when I found him because I had my ideas about soil
[03:48:14.710 --> 03:48:16.350]  science.
[03:48:16.350 --> 03:48:20.810]  But then here was somebody that had already done all the science that I wanted to do.
[03:48:20.810 --> 03:48:26.830]  So I read his books and learned a lot and really only had to make a couple of minor
[03:48:26.830 --> 03:48:29.830]  changes to my recipe to fall into line with him.
[03:48:30.270 --> 03:48:36.070]  But it was kind of the last element that unlocked for me the full growth potential of the plant.
[03:48:36.070 --> 03:48:37.070]  And I didn't know that.
[03:48:37.070 --> 03:48:39.990]  So the soil recipe is actually your recipe.
[03:48:39.990 --> 03:48:40.990]  It is.
[03:48:40.990 --> 03:48:44.550]  Yeah, I developed it really over about 30 years.
[03:48:44.550 --> 03:48:47.510]  And you know, I'm not a huge forums guy or whatever.
[03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:48.950]  I just do my own thing.
[03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:51.790]  But we're the first super soil in Colorado.
[03:48:51.790 --> 03:48:55.830]  It was around the time that Subcool and Coots and people were doing their thing.
[03:48:56.830 --> 03:49:00.430]  The viewers are asking if you guys can talk about your business.
[03:49:00.430 --> 03:49:01.430]  Sure.
[03:49:01.430 --> 03:49:02.430]  Yeah, I'm Bart Eller.
[03:49:02.430 --> 03:49:03.710]  We're Paonia Soil Co.
[03:49:03.710 --> 03:49:04.710]  I'm Joe Hennitz.
[03:49:04.710 --> 03:49:05.710]  Yep.
[03:49:05.710 --> 03:49:08.790]  Joe's our line manager at the company.
[03:49:08.790 --> 03:49:10.830]  He's a really great grower, friend.
[03:49:10.830 --> 03:49:15.550]  I was telling him backstage that he looked the part.
[03:49:15.550 --> 03:49:16.550]  That's it.
[03:49:16.550 --> 03:49:17.550]  He's got the look.
[03:49:17.550 --> 03:49:20.390]  And you guys are here in Denver as well?
[03:49:20.390 --> 03:49:22.590]  Yeah, we have resellers in Denver.
[03:49:22.590 --> 03:49:24.590]  Denver's been a tough market for us.
[03:49:25.350 --> 03:49:27.350]  We're huge on the West.
[03:49:27.350 --> 03:49:29.190]  We're huge in the South.
[03:49:29.190 --> 03:49:34.350]  But the East side of the state is really into salts.
[03:49:34.350 --> 03:49:35.830]  We sell in inert media.
[03:49:35.830 --> 03:49:39.190]  We're happy to sell people inert media, but that's not really our thing.
[03:49:39.190 --> 03:49:46.350]  Our thing is living organics and the soil food web and growing in that fashion.
[03:49:46.350 --> 03:49:48.030]  We think it's more cost effective.
[03:49:48.030 --> 03:49:49.550]  We think it's easier.
[03:49:49.550 --> 03:49:52.470]  It's obviously more healthy for the plant.
[03:49:52.790 --> 03:49:56.590]  Integrated pest management is huge too.
[03:49:56.590 --> 03:50:01.990]  You can't really do integrated pest management without a healthy soil plant base, as you
[03:50:01.990 --> 03:50:02.990]  know.
[03:50:02.990 --> 03:50:07.550]  So I would say that's probably the biggest thing that we contribute.
[03:50:07.550 --> 03:50:12.750]  I would say the best thing for having healthy soil and healthy plants is that that integrated
[03:50:12.750 --> 03:50:16.230]  pest management is going to come down because of the overall health of the plants.
[03:50:16.230 --> 03:50:18.230]  Obviously, the plant can't run away.
[03:50:18.230 --> 03:50:19.710]  So how does it improve itself?
[03:50:19.950 --> 03:50:23.950]  That's one of the reasons why we're big on adding kites to the plant.
[03:50:23.950 --> 03:50:24.950]  It's a great new tag.
[03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:26.950]  It's going to continue to grow and be healthy.
[03:50:26.950 --> 03:50:28.950]  Do you want to add something?
[03:50:28.950 --> 03:50:36.790]  Yeah, I was going to say one of the cool things about the soil, introducing better soil health,
[03:50:36.790 --> 03:50:42.350]  is that you're just absolutely spending less time dealing with pests.
[03:50:42.350 --> 03:50:44.310]  Their immune system is built up.
[03:50:44.310 --> 03:50:48.670]  They're able to withstand more pest pressure.
[03:50:48.670 --> 03:50:53.150]  And doing that in combination with beneficial insects, all of a sudden your guys are working
[03:50:53.150 --> 03:50:55.750]  less, you're working less.
[03:50:55.750 --> 03:51:00.550]  You're not having to spray your plants with stuff that you don't want to spray them with.
[03:51:00.550 --> 03:51:01.550]  It's all good.
[03:51:01.550 --> 03:51:02.550]  We're really big on being proactive.
[03:51:02.550 --> 03:51:03.550]  So are there certain predatory mice that you guys use?
[03:51:03.550 --> 03:51:04.550]  Yeah.
[03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:05.550]  Like the Swarovski and the Californicus.
[03:51:05.550 --> 03:51:11.830]  Californicus is my favorite.
[03:51:11.830 --> 03:51:12.830]  That's the first thing.
[03:51:12.830 --> 03:51:17.590]  If I go into an indoor greenhouse, first thing I do is put in Californicus.
[03:51:17.790 --> 03:51:23.270]  I feel like Californicus got a bad rap because everybody's trying to put it in after they
[03:51:23.270 --> 03:51:25.430]  have an infestation.
[03:51:25.430 --> 03:51:27.670]  And it's just not going to work right that way.
[03:51:27.670 --> 03:51:28.670]  You have to be proactive.
[03:51:28.670 --> 03:51:34.550]  And I would say that's the biggest difference between organics and salt growing styles,
[03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:37.510]  is that in salts you're kind of being reactive.
[03:51:37.510 --> 03:51:39.870]  In organics you have to be proactive.
[03:51:39.870 --> 03:51:43.830]  You have to think ahead, plan ahead, come into it ahead.
[03:51:43.830 --> 03:51:49.390]  And I guess I would say in hemp world, the biggest factor for that that I notice is like
[03:51:49.390 --> 03:51:51.430]  plastic mulch.
[03:51:51.430 --> 03:51:53.190]  I really don't like that stuff.
[03:51:53.190 --> 03:51:57.550]  But if you're coming into it, this is your first season and you've got to grow now, that's
[03:51:57.550 --> 03:52:00.390]  the only way you're going to be able to suppress those weeds.
[03:52:00.390 --> 03:52:04.070]  If you're thinking a season ahead, you can start growing out a crop like a white Dutch
[03:52:04.070 --> 03:52:06.730]  clover as a cover crop.
[03:52:06.730 --> 03:52:13.430]  And now instead of killing your soil microbes with your plastic film, you're helping culture
[03:52:13.430 --> 03:52:19.150]  your microbes and you're pumping nitrogen in from the rhizobia with the symbiotic relationship
[03:52:19.150 --> 03:52:20.550]  with the clover.
[03:52:20.550 --> 03:52:26.150]  So like the person doing the clover has a huge advantage over the person with the plastic.
[03:52:26.150 --> 03:52:27.830]  And we see it around us all the time.
[03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:31.590]  You'll see hemp farmers with these plastic fields and their plants are a quarter the
[03:52:31.590 --> 03:52:36.230]  size of the guys growing organically and with the clover cover crop.
[03:52:36.230 --> 03:52:39.350]  It's a clover mat in replacement of plastic.
[03:52:39.350 --> 03:52:40.350]  Yep.
[03:52:40.350 --> 03:52:41.350]  And it'll choke it out.
[03:52:41.350 --> 03:52:45.430]  And it's just, you have to think that season ahead.
[03:52:45.430 --> 03:52:50.510]  You have to start in the fall of the season before and you have to farm a crop of clover
[03:52:50.510 --> 03:52:55.310]  into someone who's turning bird like, oh, I'm not going to waste my time on this.
[03:52:55.310 --> 03:52:58.470]  But it pays these huge dividends down the line.
[03:52:58.470 --> 03:53:04.830]  So really in any growing and even indoors, I grow clover on all my pots.
[03:53:04.830 --> 03:53:09.510]  And I see a massive reduction in the nitrogen that I need to do that.
[03:53:09.510 --> 03:53:10.950]  It helps you get water into the plant.
[03:53:11.550 --> 03:53:14.670]  If you have plants growing there that have roots, getting water into the pots is much
[03:53:14.670 --> 03:53:15.670]  easier.
[03:53:15.670 --> 03:53:16.670]  Things like that.
[03:53:16.670 --> 03:53:17.670]  I mean, it's amazing.
[03:53:17.670 --> 03:53:18.670]  Especially for consulting, you can come in.
[03:53:18.670 --> 03:53:26.670]  Especially for consulting, you know, we come in and it's kind of like the canary in the
[03:53:26.670 --> 03:53:27.670]  coal mine.
[03:53:27.670 --> 03:53:28.670]  There's a really bad rusted infestation.
[03:53:28.670 --> 03:53:29.670]  Usually that's going to take hold of the clover crop first.
[03:53:29.670 --> 03:53:38.470]  So those are a lot of things that we use, not only to protect the soil, but also again
[03:53:38.470 --> 03:53:45.030]  to allow us to have our team work through the canopy itself and try to find little
[03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:48.270]  nuances like you guys have mentioned about integrating this.
[03:53:48.270 --> 03:53:52.350]  We feel like when you are focused on feeding the soil, not the plant, that's going to allow
[03:53:52.350 --> 03:53:57.550]  your entire team to move their focus down to up where that's really where the money
[03:53:57.550 --> 03:53:58.550]  is.
[03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:59.550]  Yes, thank you.
[03:53:59.550 --> 03:54:00.550]  For sure.
[03:54:00.550 --> 03:54:01.550]  Exactly.
[03:54:01.550 --> 03:54:02.790]  Your team can, you're adjusting where your guys are working.
[03:54:02.790 --> 03:54:04.430]  All of a sudden the hours are reduced.
[03:54:04.430 --> 03:54:09.270]  You can go and take care of what you need to take care of instead of just being behind,
[03:54:09.270 --> 03:54:11.190]  fighting, fighting, fighting.
[03:54:11.190 --> 03:54:13.310]  It's still magic to me to this day.
[03:54:13.310 --> 03:54:18.750]  Just how you can have all these little microbes working like your worker bots doing this work
[03:54:18.750 --> 03:54:21.550]  for you and how amazing that is.
[03:54:21.550 --> 03:54:27.190]  It blows my mind and I love looking through the scope and seeing them doing their job
[03:54:27.190 --> 03:54:33.150]  and to be a steward or be able to use them in a way to do something for me just feels
[03:54:33.190 --> 03:54:34.190]  a little bit like magic.
[03:54:34.190 --> 03:54:40.510]  It's a world upon world upon world when you start to actually look through that microscope.
[03:54:40.510 --> 03:54:43.310]  It really is amazing what's going on.
[03:54:43.310 --> 03:54:48.910]  Now you start to see that just like a tablespoon of soil, there's more microbes in that than
[03:54:48.910 --> 03:54:50.670]  there are people on this plant.
[03:54:50.670 --> 03:54:51.670]  Isn't it crazy?
[03:54:51.670 --> 03:54:56.030]  It's just mind-boggling once you start to understand the real science of stuff.
[03:54:56.030 --> 03:54:58.030]  That's something else that we do each and every Thursday.
[03:54:58.030 --> 03:55:03.470]  We're trying to remove the bro science that a lot of us have dealt with from Overgrow,
[03:55:03.470 --> 03:55:05.310]  IGMAG, even those were great.
[03:55:05.310 --> 03:55:06.550]  It's hard to get away from sometimes.
[03:55:06.550 --> 03:55:08.590]  There was no checks and balances.
[03:55:08.590 --> 03:55:13.390]  There wasn't live feed like we have today where if we said something that was incorrect,
[03:55:13.390 --> 03:55:15.390]  the viewers would be all over the place.
[03:55:15.390 --> 03:55:16.390]  Calling you out.
[03:55:16.390 --> 03:55:17.390]  That's what we like about it.
[03:55:17.390 --> 03:55:18.390]  That's good.
[03:55:18.390 --> 03:55:19.390]  Let us have it.
[03:55:19.390 --> 03:55:20.390]  We've said several times with ICMAG, with Overgrow and that kind of stuff back in the
[03:55:20.390 --> 03:55:21.390]  day, we're not going to do that.
[03:55:21.390 --> 03:55:22.390]  We're going to do it.
[03:55:22.390 --> 03:55:23.390]  We're going to do it.
[03:55:23.390 --> 03:55:24.390]  We're going to do it.
[03:55:24.390 --> 03:55:25.390]  We're going to do it.
[03:55:25.390 --> 03:55:26.390]  We're going to do it.
[03:55:26.390 --> 03:55:27.390]  We're going to do it.
[03:56:27.790 --> 03:56:29.510]  There were finally that you would post a question, and then sometimes you did it on a Thursday,
[03:56:29.510 --> 03:56:32.510]  you wouldn't get a response until Monday.
[03:56:32.510 --> 03:56:39.050]  There are a lot of things that we feel like a lot of these growers, maybe growers that
[03:56:39.050 --> 03:56:43.510]  are newer to living soil, they have a huge advantage to a lot of us that started out
[03:56:43.510 --> 03:56:46.810]  just reading books, and in fact you're going to be able to ask questions in real time,
[03:56:46.810 --> 03:56:47.810]  get those answers back.
[03:56:47.810 --> 03:56:48.810]  Know which books to read.
[03:56:48.810 --> 03:56:51.810]  Know which books are, in my opinion, kind of a waste time at this point.
[03:56:51.810 --> 03:56:56.870]  For a lot of us out there, there's no reason for us to know about CDs because there's MT
[03:56:56.870 --> 03:57:03.630]  really, there's another phenomena where there's now all this nitrogen in the soil.
[03:57:03.630 --> 03:57:08.190]  With the salt, you have to put double the amount that you need for it to uptake.
[03:57:08.190 --> 03:57:12.650]  So you always have half again as much nitrogen just sitting idle in your soil.
[03:57:12.650 --> 03:57:14.190]  And then the soil microbes are going to win.
[03:57:14.190 --> 03:57:16.350]  They're going to process that nitrogen.
[03:57:16.350 --> 03:57:18.310]  And what do they need to process nitrogen?
[03:57:18.310 --> 03:57:20.010]  It's going to be carbon.
[03:57:20.010 --> 03:57:25.150]  So then you just end up burning all the carbon out of your soil the whole rest of the year.
[03:57:25.150 --> 03:57:29.070]  And so that's why time and time again, I see hundreds and hundreds of soils tests.
[03:57:29.070 --> 03:57:33.990]  And anywhere they've been feeding nitrate salts, they have almost no organic matter.
[03:57:33.990 --> 03:57:38.210]  And that organic matter is the complete water holding capability of your soil.
[03:57:38.210 --> 03:57:43.550]  So you take one of these farms where it was 1% organic matter, and you take it to two,
[03:57:43.550 --> 03:57:48.630]  if you double your organic matter, you get a 300% increase in the water holding capability
[03:57:48.630 --> 03:57:49.630]  of the soil.
[03:57:49.990 --> 03:57:57.190]  And you see that all over the country in every kind of standard agriculture.
[03:57:57.190 --> 03:58:01.390]  They could do so much more using organics.
[03:58:01.390 --> 03:58:05.790]  And they could be more profitable and grow a healthier plant.
[03:58:05.790 --> 03:58:08.550]  But it really does take getting the word out.
[03:58:08.550 --> 03:58:09.710]  If you don't know, you don't know.
[03:58:09.710 --> 03:58:16.190]  We just kind of assume that because that's what our parents did, that we're farmers,
[03:58:16.190 --> 03:58:17.790]  that that's what we need to do.
[03:58:17.830 --> 03:58:22.510]  But their grandparents were growing organic and had amazing yields and didn't have this
[03:58:22.510 --> 03:58:24.190]  depleted soil situation.
[03:58:24.190 --> 03:58:25.190]  Right on.
[03:58:25.190 --> 03:58:26.870]  Are you self-taught farmers?
[03:58:26.870 --> 03:58:27.870]  Yes.
[03:58:27.870 --> 03:58:28.870]  Yeah.
[03:58:28.870 --> 03:58:31.150]  That's really what our show is trying to cater to.
[03:58:31.150 --> 03:58:36.670]  Maybe somebody that doesn't have the means, maybe has children and isn't able to go to
[03:58:36.670 --> 03:58:37.670]  school.
[03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:42.710]  We're trying as best as we can to be able to bring the best and brightest minds up cannabis
[03:58:42.710 --> 03:58:44.750]  to our show each and every Thursday.
[03:58:44.750 --> 03:58:48.670]  So we'd love to maybe extend that to you guys in town where we can kind of talk more
[03:58:48.670 --> 03:58:49.670]  about self-education.
[03:58:49.670 --> 03:58:50.670]  Right on.
[03:58:50.670 --> 03:58:52.950]  That's really something big.
[03:58:52.950 --> 03:58:54.270]  It's something you just keep working on.
[03:58:54.270 --> 03:58:55.590]  I mean, we get better and better.
[03:58:55.590 --> 03:58:58.150]  All of us are getting better all the time.
[03:58:58.150 --> 03:59:01.070]  And don't be afraid of it.
[03:59:01.070 --> 03:59:05.550]  It's fun.
[03:59:05.550 --> 03:59:06.550]  You can make your own medicine.
[03:59:06.550 --> 03:59:07.550]  How cool is that?
[03:59:07.550 --> 03:59:13.830]  I feel like experience is something that a lot of people are lacking because when someone
[03:59:13.910 --> 03:59:17.910]  tells you something but you don't have the experience to know that that's bullshit, that's
[03:59:17.910 --> 03:59:19.750]  gross science, and then you go out and do that.
[03:59:19.750 --> 03:59:21.230]  I have a short story about that.
[03:59:21.230 --> 03:59:25.910]  When I'm from Oberlin, I was trying to learn more about how to improve turkeys about 10
[03:59:25.910 --> 03:59:26.910]  years ago.
[03:59:26.910 --> 03:59:30.510]  And somebody that was a troll basically got on there and told me that I needed to add
[03:59:30.510 --> 03:59:32.510]  a bunch of humidity laters on.
[03:59:32.510 --> 03:59:36.510]  So I'd run down the way back to the yard and buy the two most expensive humidifiers.
[03:59:36.510 --> 03:59:40.510]  I put one on one side of the tent, one on the other, and I gave myself a...
[03:59:40.510 --> 03:59:41.510]  Betrayed us straight up.
[03:59:41.510 --> 03:59:42.510]  Yeah.
[03:59:43.190 --> 03:59:45.190]  I was going to say betrayed us, but yeah, exactly.
[03:59:45.190 --> 03:59:46.190]  So again, I can feel it.
[03:59:46.190 --> 03:59:51.190]  That's why I'm so big on education because I maybe lost probably four months, five months
[03:59:51.190 --> 03:59:52.190]  of that.
[03:59:52.190 --> 03:59:55.190]  And I wasn't good at growing and I definitely didn't have the pocket money.
[03:59:55.190 --> 03:59:57.190]  There was money in my pocket.
[03:59:57.190 --> 04:00:01.190]  So the Excel bill still came, all the other fixed costs that come.
[04:00:01.190 --> 04:00:05.190]  And I didn't have the income at that time from what I was trying to do.
[04:00:05.190 --> 04:00:10.190]  So that's one of the main things that I want to express to the community as I get older
[04:00:10.870 --> 04:00:12.870]  is to kind of give back and show experience.
[04:00:12.870 --> 04:00:14.870]  Is there anything that you can kind of give me?
[04:00:14.870 --> 04:00:16.870]  We kind of look through these gold nuggets each and every Thursday.
[04:00:16.870 --> 04:00:20.870]  Is there something that you feel like maybe just you've discovered?
[04:00:20.870 --> 04:00:23.870]  Like something that I'm loving right now or like some kind of...
[04:00:23.870 --> 04:00:25.870]  What's a gold nugget in the way that you grow?
[04:00:25.870 --> 04:00:33.870]  Well, the biggest thing that Bart's taught me is a plant's immune system coupled with
[04:00:33.870 --> 04:00:34.870]  beneficial insects.
[04:00:34.870 --> 04:00:37.870]  All of a sudden you're not spraying.
[04:00:37.870 --> 04:00:39.870]  I'm just done with spraying.
[04:00:40.550 --> 04:00:41.550]  These plants are immune.
[04:00:41.550 --> 04:00:43.550]  They're dealing with the bugs.
[04:00:43.550 --> 04:00:46.550]  The bugs are eating them, the californicus and stuff like that.
[04:00:46.550 --> 04:00:48.550]  And like he said, you have to be proactive.
[04:00:48.550 --> 04:00:50.550]  You have to start that from the beginning.
[04:00:50.550 --> 04:00:53.550]  But now all of a sudden my hours are reduced in the greenhouse.
[04:00:53.550 --> 04:00:57.550]  I spend way, way less time in there and the plants are looking great.
[04:00:57.550 --> 04:01:00.550]  And so that to me has changed my life growing for sure.
[04:01:00.550 --> 04:01:02.550]  That gives you time to defend.
[04:01:02.550 --> 04:01:03.550]  That's what I'm saying.
[04:01:03.550 --> 04:01:04.550]  And I'm not worrying about it.
[04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:05.550]  I'm not fighting.
[04:01:05.550 --> 04:01:07.550]  I'm not fighting getting water into them every day.
[04:01:07.550 --> 04:01:08.550]  They're in a bigger pot now.
[04:01:09.230 --> 04:01:11.230]  I sit for four days instead of having to water every single day.
[04:01:11.230 --> 04:01:13.230]  Gives him time to play house music.
[04:01:13.230 --> 04:01:14.230]  Yeah.
[04:01:14.230 --> 04:01:15.230]  Oh, right on.
[04:01:15.230 --> 04:01:16.230]  Stackhouse and soil, man.
[04:01:16.230 --> 04:01:17.230]  That's what we do.
[04:01:17.230 --> 04:01:18.230]  Right on.
[04:01:18.230 --> 04:01:19.230]  I hear people blowing those things up.
[04:01:19.230 --> 04:01:20.230]  B&T.
[04:01:20.230 --> 04:01:21.230]  Right on.
[04:01:21.230 --> 04:01:22.230]  Bart, same question for you, bud.
[04:01:22.230 --> 04:01:23.230]  A little gold nugget that you feel like over the years you've been cultivating and examining
[04:01:23.230 --> 04:01:24.230]  and you're still doing it.
[04:01:24.230 --> 04:01:25.230]  What's the biggest thing that you've learned from the experience?
[04:01:25.230 --> 04:01:26.230]  I think the biggest thing is that you're not afraid of the bugs.
[04:01:26.230 --> 04:01:27.230]  You're not afraid of the bugs.
[04:01:27.230 --> 04:01:28.230]  You're not afraid of the bugs.
[04:01:28.230 --> 04:01:29.230]  You're not afraid of the bugs.
[04:01:29.230 --> 04:01:30.230]  You're not afraid of the bugs.
[04:01:30.230 --> 04:01:31.230]  You're not afraid of the bugs.
[04:01:31.230 --> 04:01:32.230]  You're not afraid of the bugs.
[04:01:33.010 --> 04:01:48.030]  Yeah, so that was just something that we just took an avocado, cut it in eggs like a baked
[04:01:48.030 --> 04:01:49.030]  potato.
[04:01:49.030 --> 04:01:53.650]  Pop that avocado open, and then we stick that fleshy part into the soil system.
[04:01:53.650 --> 04:01:57.910]  Those composting worms are going to be attracted to the avocado.
[04:01:57.910 --> 04:02:00.970]  Composting worms are herpaphrodites, so as soon as they touch each other, they want to
[04:02:00.970 --> 04:02:01.970]  reproduce.
[04:02:01.970 --> 04:02:04.010]  the ways that we've given back to the people
[04:02:04.010 --> 04:02:06.090]  where they create compost and worms
[04:02:06.090 --> 04:02:07.690]  for literal pennies on the dollar
[04:02:07.690 --> 04:02:10.170]  compared to shipping them, how long it takes to do it.
[04:02:10.170 --> 04:02:11.290]  Yeah, awesome.
[04:02:11.290 --> 04:02:12.690]  That's great.
[04:02:12.690 --> 04:02:16.410]  I would say something really that we've been talking
[04:02:16.410 --> 04:02:18.610]  to a lot of people about today,
[04:02:18.610 --> 04:02:21.970]  it's not directly soil specific,
[04:02:21.970 --> 04:02:26.890]  but I'm really a proponent of using aerated,
[04:02:26.890 --> 04:02:30.890]  like either soil blocks or something like that for starts.
[04:02:30.890 --> 04:02:34.770]  I love transplanting not in hard side containers
[04:02:34.770 --> 04:02:36.530]  because of the root circling.
[04:02:36.530 --> 04:02:38.930]  I really love air pruned starts.
[04:02:38.930 --> 04:02:40.890]  And I feel like that gives me a good week
[04:02:40.890 --> 04:02:43.090]  and jump every time I transplant
[04:02:43.090 --> 04:02:44.850]  because the plant's just ready to go again.
[04:02:44.850 --> 04:02:49.850]  I'll transplant like soil blocks from one to another
[04:02:51.410 --> 04:02:55.010]  and see growth that afternoon instead of that kind of four,
[04:02:55.010 --> 04:02:57.770]  three to four to five day lag
[04:02:57.770 --> 04:02:59.930]  while a plant recovers from the shock
[04:02:59.970 --> 04:03:02.170]  of having its roots messed with.
[04:03:02.170 --> 04:03:03.530]  And I see people a lot of times
[04:03:03.530 --> 04:03:05.210]  just doing the craziest stuff with the roots,
[04:03:05.210 --> 04:03:08.010]  cutting the roots up and doing this and doing that.
[04:03:08.010 --> 04:03:10.530]  And I'm a huge proponent of leaving the roots
[04:03:10.530 --> 04:03:13.370]  as where they are and using your soil
[04:03:13.370 --> 04:03:17.410]  and either your pots or your blocks or something like that
[04:03:17.410 --> 04:03:20.290]  to make it easy and keep that plant healthy
[04:03:20.290 --> 04:03:22.050]  through the transplant.
[04:03:22.050 --> 04:03:25.370]  It buys you more time to do the transplant too.
[04:03:25.370 --> 04:03:27.090]  Like let's say you're behind,
[04:03:27.090 --> 04:03:29.130]  you can't get to it that day or whatever,
[04:03:29.170 --> 04:03:31.810]  your roots aren't just binding and binding and binding.
[04:03:31.810 --> 04:03:33.210]  If they're air pruned, all of a sudden,
[04:03:33.210 --> 04:03:35.690]  they're much more healthy for longer
[04:03:35.690 --> 04:03:37.170]  in that same size container.
[04:03:37.170 --> 04:03:38.210]  So that's what comes to mind
[04:03:38.210 --> 04:03:40.050]  after talking to several people today,
[04:03:40.050 --> 04:03:42.970]  but yeah, there are many great tips.
[04:03:42.970 --> 04:03:44.690]  And I've seen great stuff on your show,
[04:03:44.690 --> 04:03:45.770]  of course, in the past
[04:03:45.770 --> 04:03:47.790]  and really appreciate everything you do
[04:03:47.790 --> 04:03:49.490]  for the living soil community.
[04:03:49.490 --> 04:03:50.330]  Swear.
[04:03:50.330 --> 04:03:51.330]  So yeah, we're all out here
[04:03:51.330 --> 04:03:54.210]  just trying to help people's lives be better and easier
[04:03:54.210 --> 04:03:58.130]  and to grow their food and the medicine that they have
[04:03:58.130 --> 04:04:00.010]  a need and can.
[04:04:00.010 --> 04:04:01.370]  So.
[04:04:01.370 --> 04:04:03.530]  So if guys wanna learn more about you,
[04:04:03.530 --> 04:04:04.770]  where can we find you at?

[04:04:31.250 --> 04:04:32.650]  since you want another golden nugget
[04:04:32.650 --> 04:04:34.890]  is that a well-made compost
[04:04:34.890 --> 04:04:36.890]  can be an amazing flowering nutrient.
[04:04:37.730 --> 04:04:42.150]  You know, it provides PK plus cow mag,
[04:04:42.150 --> 04:04:43.730]  plus some trace minerals,
[04:04:43.730 --> 04:04:46.290]  plus that boost of microbiology.
[04:04:46.290 --> 04:04:47.730]  So we love compost teas,
[04:04:47.730 --> 04:04:51.570]  but we'll also use like our dynamic dressing compost
[04:04:51.570 --> 04:04:54.730]  as a straight flower nutrient and it works amazing.
[04:04:55.090 --> 04:04:58.450]  And so, yeah, if you have a good compost,
[04:04:58.450 --> 04:05:01.450]  even your own, it can be an amazing flower nutrient.
[04:05:01.450 --> 04:05:03.650]  A lot of people don't know that.
[04:05:03.650 --> 04:05:04.850]  Well, I appreciate your time guys.
[04:05:04.850 --> 04:05:06.490]  I know that it's take two of you away

[04:05:19.130 --> 04:05:20.250]  and talking further.

[04:05:40.360 --> 04:05:50.670]  just a multitasking.

[04:06:04.350 --> 04:06:07.910]  didn't wanna go in the bathtub with the babysitter.
[04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:11.910]  And so I had to run up there and I gave her a bath bomb.
[04:06:11.910 --> 04:06:14.430]  Suddenly then she wanted to go in the bathtub.
[04:06:23.440 --> 04:06:25.360]  All right, well, hold on.
[04:06:25.360 --> 04:06:26.200]  Well, I'll tell you what,

[04:09:46.050 --> 04:09:47.970]  Merci, merci beaucoup.
[04:09:54.210 --> 04:09:59.210]  This one was written about a famous politician in Jamaica.
[04:09:59.370 --> 04:10:02.610]  Several youths families lost their lives.
[04:10:03.450 --> 04:10:05.410]  Yeah, and so my only way,
[04:10:05.410 --> 04:10:08.890]  my way to deal with it was to write about it.

[04:16:25.520 --> 04:16:26.360]  What up, Peter?
[04:16:26.360 --> 04:16:28.840]  Can you hit those high notes?
[04:16:28.840 --> 04:16:30.080]  No, I got bass.
[04:16:32.360 --> 04:16:33.280]  Bass voice.

[04:16:40.760 --> 04:16:41.600]  Go ahead.
[04:16:42.520 --> 04:16:44.040]  See, I got a question.
[04:16:44.080 --> 04:16:45.840]  I got this product, right?
[04:16:45.840 --> 04:16:48.680]  Oh, that does look like shit, huh?
[04:16:49.880 --> 04:16:53.240]  He's just noticing I've been making videos.
[04:16:53.240 --> 04:16:57.520]  Now, I think it's 100% the exhibit hall.
[04:16:57.520 --> 04:17:00.320]  Oh yeah, we're in a block of concrete
[04:17:00.320 --> 04:17:02.120]  in the dungeon in the basement.
[04:17:02.120 --> 04:17:06.040]  Like, they gave us the worst spot to do this.
[04:17:06.040 --> 04:17:07.760]  All right, so what's the question?
[04:17:07.760 --> 04:17:10.360]  So, I have this crystalline, right?
[04:17:10.360 --> 04:17:11.200]  CBD.
[04:17:12.160 --> 04:17:14.560]  One company I've ever seen can make it,
[04:17:14.560 --> 04:17:16.120]  or has this stuff, right?
[04:17:16.120 --> 04:17:18.520]  Nobody else has this quality.
[04:17:19.640 --> 04:17:21.800]  I wanna know in the ether,
[04:17:23.200 --> 04:17:25.200]  can anybody else make this?
[04:17:25.200 --> 04:17:27.160]  Okay, well, first of all, what company is that?
[04:17:27.160 --> 04:17:29.360]  Let me look them up.
[04:17:29.360 --> 04:17:30.480]  Well, I'd rather not.
[04:17:30.480 --> 04:17:31.920]  I'd rather keep that little,
[04:17:31.920 --> 04:17:34.320]  that's my little honey.
[04:17:34.320 --> 04:17:35.720]  All right, so you wanna know

[04:17:41.920 --> 04:17:43.400]  Like, isolate?
[04:17:43.400 --> 04:17:44.440]  No, crystalline.
[04:17:44.440 --> 04:17:45.640]  Isolate's like powder.
[04:17:45.640 --> 04:17:49.080]  This stuff is like straight crystal.
[04:17:49.080 --> 04:17:51.320]  But is it pure CBD, I guess is the question.
[04:17:51.320 --> 04:17:52.160]  Yes.
[04:17:52.160 --> 04:17:53.000]  Okay.
[04:17:53.000 --> 04:17:53.840]  Yeah.
[04:17:53.840 --> 04:17:55.360]  But it's, whatever the formulation is,
[04:17:55.360 --> 04:17:57.800]  it seems like nobody else can match it.
[04:17:57.800 --> 04:18:00.160]  But it's the only stuff that I've found
[04:18:00.160 --> 04:18:03.400]  that works efficiently across the board
[04:18:04.360 --> 04:18:06.920]  with everyone's conditions.
[04:18:06.920 --> 04:18:09.920]  Sorry, I'm monitoring the chat, too.
[04:18:11.320 --> 04:18:12.400]  Classy, Rob.
[04:18:14.040 --> 04:18:19.200]  All right, so, of the people paying attention right now,
[04:18:19.200 --> 04:18:20.960]  if someone has a CBD,
[04:18:25.160 --> 04:18:26.680]  well, that, yeah, that's what,
[04:18:26.680 --> 04:18:28.160]  so for you, what are you using it for?
[04:18:28.160 --> 04:18:29.440]  Are you, like, when you're super high
[04:18:29.440 --> 04:18:31.840]  and you wanna kinda downshift, or?
[04:18:31.840 --> 04:18:35.840]  Yeah, well, I have anxiety, I get panic attacks,
[04:18:36.760 --> 04:18:39.320]  super aggro, I got anger problems.
[04:18:39.320 --> 04:18:40.160]  Really?
[04:18:40.240 --> 04:18:42.800]  Oh, yeah, that's why I smoke so much.
[04:18:42.800 --> 04:18:45.920]  Eh, I got fucking problems, bro.
[04:18:45.920 --> 04:18:49.480]  But I, it helps, right, swelling.
[04:18:49.480 --> 04:18:52.120]  I cut my arm in half, Damien, I got hit by a car.
[04:18:52.120 --> 04:18:53.720]  Ever showed you guys that?
[04:18:53.720 --> 04:18:54.560]  No.
[04:18:54.560 --> 04:18:55.640]  Check this out.
[04:18:55.640 --> 04:18:57.720]  But show us on the 8-bit,
[04:18:59.480 --> 04:19:00.840]  I can't see any of it.
[04:19:00.840 --> 04:19:01.960]  Peeled it.
[04:19:01.960 --> 04:19:03.800]  I'll get you, but anyways, yeah, I use it for-
[04:19:03.800 --> 04:19:05.800]  When you're back in the garage studio,
[04:19:05.800 --> 04:19:08.440]  you can give us the elbow shot again.
[04:19:08.440 --> 04:19:09.280]  All right, well, hey, we got-
[04:19:09.320 --> 04:19:10.760]  We're back in HD.
[04:19:10.760 --> 04:19:12.560]  Yeah, yeah, we got people, I'll check out.
[04:19:12.560 --> 04:19:13.400]  All right.
[04:19:13.400 --> 04:19:14.240]  All right.
[04:19:14.240 --> 04:19:15.080]  Thanks.
[04:19:15.080 --> 04:19:15.920]  All right.
[04:19:15.920 --> 04:19:16.760]  Thank you.
[04:19:16.760 --> 04:19:17.600]  Merci.
[04:19:22.770 --> 04:19:26.450]  This one's about my first girlfriend, you know?
[04:19:26.450 --> 04:19:27.290]  Well, it's too late now,
[04:19:27.290 --> 04:19:29.970]  we got Moon Mother Hemp Company in the house.
[04:19:29.970 --> 04:19:31.490]  Woo!
[04:19:31.490 --> 04:19:33.450]  She's a little nervous, but that's all right.
[04:19:33.450 --> 04:19:36.890]  The crowd's going nuts, the crowd of one.
[04:19:36.890 --> 04:19:38.730]  It's just you and me and Brian.
[04:19:38.730 --> 04:19:41.810]  One, two, three.
[04:19:41.850 --> 04:19:45.210]  All right, so we got Moon Mother Hemp, in my opinion,
[04:19:45.210 --> 04:19:46.370]  definitely my wife's opinion.
[04:19:46.370 --> 04:19:49.130]  This is one of the high quality companies
[04:19:49.130 --> 04:19:50.850]  here in Denver, Colorado.
[04:19:50.850 --> 04:19:52.490]  One of the reasons for that is that
[04:19:52.490 --> 04:19:54.770]  most of this is done in-house.
[04:19:54.770 --> 04:19:57.770]  Your husband is the farmer, you're helping him farm?
[04:19:57.770 --> 04:20:00.010]  Yeah, I want to be on the farm more than I am,
[04:20:00.010 --> 04:20:03.370]  but we're planting all the seeds ourselves,
[04:20:03.370 --> 04:20:06.410]  we're harvesting all the plants, hand harvesting.
[04:20:06.410 --> 04:20:07.970]  We take really good care of the plants,
[04:20:07.970 --> 04:20:10.290]  and that makes a big difference.
[04:20:10.290 --> 04:20:12.170]  We take good care of the soil, too.
[04:20:12.170 --> 04:20:13.930]  So there's a reason why your products
[04:20:13.930 --> 04:20:15.530]  are starting to stand out among
[04:20:16.530 --> 04:20:18.370]  so many other products out there.
[04:20:18.370 --> 04:20:21.130]  And I feel like it's, not only with the branding,
[04:20:21.130 --> 04:20:23.930]  I feel like you guys are very sleek and unique.
[04:20:23.930 --> 04:20:26.010]  Branding is, in my opinion,
[04:20:26.890 --> 04:20:29.210]  probably 40% of it sometimes,
[04:20:29.210 --> 04:20:32.810]  is having somebody pick your product over the shelf itself.
[04:20:32.810 --> 04:20:36.450]  So let's kind of go deeper into the products that you make.
[04:20:36.450 --> 04:20:37.290]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:20:37.330 --> 04:20:41.050]  So it all starts with high-quality certified organic hemp,
[04:20:41.050 --> 04:20:43.890]  certified organic raw materials, raw ingredients,
[04:20:43.890 --> 04:20:46.970]  and they're all carefully selected for wellness,
[04:20:46.970 --> 04:20:48.890]  for mind and body and spirit.
[04:20:49.770 --> 04:20:52.210]  Our supply chain is ethical.
[04:20:52.210 --> 04:20:54.490]  We really pride ourselves on an ethical supply chain,
[04:20:54.490 --> 04:20:58.250]  not only in ingredients, but also with our packaging.
[04:20:58.250 --> 04:21:01.290]  It's all 100% post-consumer recycled packaging,
[04:21:01.290 --> 04:21:03.130]  papers, hemp paper.
[04:21:03.130 --> 04:21:07.090]  We use really ethical packaging as well,
[04:21:07.890 --> 04:21:09.650]  including water-based tapes.
[04:21:09.650 --> 04:21:10.690]  Everything's really,
[04:21:14.410 --> 04:21:16.490]  like really well thought out, essentially.
[04:21:16.490 --> 04:21:17.330]  100%.
[04:21:17.330 --> 04:21:19.850]  And you guys, you're using genetics
[04:21:19.850 --> 04:21:21.370]  that you and your husband are picking out,
[04:21:21.370 --> 04:21:23.090]  and I feel like that's why your products
[04:21:23.090 --> 04:21:24.450]  are being so effective.
[04:21:25.330 --> 04:21:30.330]  Obviously, my fiancee has a variety of companies
[04:21:30.370 --> 04:21:31.850]  that she could get free products from,
[04:21:31.850 --> 04:21:34.370]  and I feel like she goes out of her way.
[04:21:34.370 --> 04:21:36.130]  There's really two companies that she enjoys,
[04:21:36.170 --> 04:21:37.010]  Dreamin Farms,
[04:21:37.010 --> 04:21:38.690]  which they've actually been on the show as well,
[04:21:38.690 --> 04:21:40.690]  and then Moon Mother Hemp, which is your company as well.
[04:21:40.690 --> 04:21:42.290]  I love that she loves our products.
[04:21:42.290 --> 04:21:43.690]  Tasa, you know I love you.
[04:21:43.690 --> 04:21:44.570]  You're so amazing.
[04:21:45.890 --> 04:21:48.170]  And I think that part of it is,
[04:21:48.170 --> 04:21:49.530]  it's not just the genetics,
[04:21:49.530 --> 04:21:51.890]  it's not high-quality hemp and genetics
[04:21:51.890 --> 04:21:53.890]  that are the biggest part of it,
[04:21:53.890 --> 04:21:56.170]  but it's all about intentional,
[04:21:57.370 --> 04:21:58.970]  it's all about the intentional formula.
[04:21:58.970 --> 04:22:00.570]  So if you look at the formulas,
[04:22:00.570 --> 04:22:02.450]  if you look at the products, the ingredients,
[04:22:02.450 --> 04:22:06.050]  all of it starts with an extremely intentional formula
[04:22:06.970 --> 04:22:08.770]  and it's all about the ingredients and herbs.
[04:22:08.770 --> 04:22:10.930]  So as a certified clinical herbalist,
[04:22:10.930 --> 04:22:12.170]  I'm always thinking,
[04:22:12.170 --> 04:22:14.690]  what are the constituents in the plants?
[04:22:14.690 --> 04:22:15.730]  What are some of the terpenes
[04:22:15.730 --> 04:22:17.290]  that the other ingredients have?
[04:22:17.290 --> 04:22:19.730]  How are these all gonna work synergistically together
[04:22:19.730 --> 04:22:23.410]  to create the most effective herbal formulation?
[04:22:23.410 --> 04:22:26.090]  And we're not even using excessive amounts of CBD
[04:22:26.090 --> 04:22:28.890]  to overcompensate for a low-grade formulation.
[04:22:28.890 --> 04:22:31.770]  We use medium amounts of CBD
[04:22:31.770 --> 04:22:33.530]  and a really high-grade formulation
[04:22:33.570 --> 04:22:35.050]  without CBD.
[04:22:35.050 --> 04:22:36.690]  What are some of the products that you wanna highlight?
[04:22:36.690 --> 04:22:39.650]  I know you brought some of them with you.
[04:22:39.650 --> 04:22:42.010]  So you have the massage oil here.
[04:22:42.010 --> 04:22:44.130]  So the massage oil is actually quickly becoming
[04:22:44.130 --> 04:22:46.490]  a really amazing bestseller.
[04:22:46.490 --> 04:22:50.010]  It was kind of an afterthought for a long time,
[04:22:50.010 --> 04:22:51.650]  but massage therapists are really starting
[04:22:51.650 --> 04:22:53.130]  to bring this into their practice.
[04:22:53.130 --> 04:22:57.370]  And so it's taking off along the massage therapy community
[04:22:57.370 --> 04:22:59.490]  and in the spa industry as well.
[04:22:59.490 --> 04:23:01.290]  One of our best sellers is on muscle balm
[04:23:01.330 --> 04:23:04.650]  and this is an extremely effective product
[04:23:04.650 --> 04:23:06.010]  for muscle and joint pain.
[04:23:06.010 --> 04:23:08.410]  I brought our new eye serum, which I really love.
[04:23:08.410 --> 04:23:11.690]  Just quickly, I feel like we need to integrate Daguerre
[04:23:11.690 --> 04:23:16.370]  into this conversation as our QVC model
[04:23:16.370 --> 04:23:18.970]  who rubs the stuff on himself
[04:23:18.970 --> 04:23:20.650]  while you guys are talking about it.
[04:23:20.650 --> 04:23:21.810]  This is our friend over here.
[04:23:21.810 --> 04:23:22.930]  So if he could take his shirt-
[04:23:22.930 --> 04:23:24.530]  I think Laney would be really,
[04:23:24.530 --> 04:23:25.370]  we have my friend Laney over here.
[04:23:25.370 --> 04:23:26.490]  If he could take his shirt off
[04:23:26.490 --> 04:23:31.090]  and maybe Brian could put the massage oil on Daguerre
[04:23:31.930 --> 04:23:34.890]  We have a female standing by as well that could do this.
[04:23:36.410 --> 04:23:38.450]  Do you want to showcase some of the products?
[04:23:39.810 --> 04:23:42.730]  Laney's going to be an amazing addition to this talk.
[04:23:42.730 --> 04:23:43.970]  Is Laney shy too?
[04:23:43.970 --> 04:23:45.170]  She's off camera right now.
[04:23:45.170 --> 04:23:47.530]  She's feeling a little shy, but she can carry some.
[04:23:47.530 --> 04:23:48.370]  Oh, there she is.
[04:23:50.850 --> 04:23:52.770]  Yeah, you can even, if you want to walk around
[04:23:52.770 --> 04:23:53.970]  and that's the camera.
[04:23:53.970 --> 04:23:55.010]  Oh, the camera's there.
[04:23:55.010 --> 04:23:55.850]  Okay, so I'll-
[04:23:55.850 --> 04:23:59.490]  We're currently an eight bit early Nintendo
[04:23:59.490 --> 04:24:00.650]  Here we go.
[04:24:01.050 --> 04:24:01.890]  Broadcast quality.
[04:24:05.530 --> 04:24:06.890]  It doesn't look good.
[04:24:06.890 --> 04:24:07.810]  It's fine.
[04:24:07.810 --> 04:24:08.650]  Carry on.
[04:24:08.650 --> 04:24:09.490]  Don't even worry about it.
[04:24:09.490 --> 04:24:10.810]  Who is talking to us?
[04:24:10.810 --> 04:24:12.650]  So that is God.
[04:24:12.650 --> 04:24:14.250]  So God, oh no, it's Peter.
[04:24:15.210 --> 04:24:18.330]  So Peter is the creator of the Future Cannabis Project.
[04:24:18.330 --> 04:24:20.370]  This is the show that I'm sure you're familiar
[04:24:20.370 --> 04:24:22.810]  from TASO every Thursday.
[04:24:22.810 --> 04:24:23.850]  You're on it right now.
[04:24:23.850 --> 04:24:25.090]  Hey, what's happening?
[04:24:26.170 --> 04:24:27.690]  Yeah, so we have the eye roller.
[04:24:27.690 --> 04:24:30.170]  We have our glow skin serum.
[04:24:30.690 --> 04:24:32.930]  Our CBD skincare line is also really taking off.
[04:24:32.930 --> 04:24:35.410]  It's all a hundred percent organic,
[04:24:35.410 --> 04:24:38.450]  super high quality oils, ingredients, raw materials.
[04:24:39.610 --> 04:24:43.130]  And our first CBD skincare product
[04:24:43.130 --> 04:24:44.410]  was our glow skin serum.
[04:24:44.410 --> 04:24:46.810]  And so this is one of our oldest products
[04:24:46.810 --> 04:24:48.370]  that we've ever created.
[04:24:48.370 --> 04:24:51.130]  And one of our best sellers as well.
[04:24:51.130 --> 04:24:53.370]  I know TASO is a big one on this.
[04:24:53.370 --> 04:24:54.210]  She loves that.
[04:24:54.210 --> 04:24:55.050]  The skin serum.
[04:24:55.050 --> 04:24:57.090]  I see this in the bathroom every morning.
[04:24:57.330 --> 04:24:58.170]  Yeah.
[04:24:59.410 --> 04:25:00.250]  I mean, it's good.
[04:25:00.250 --> 04:25:01.090]  I use it.
[04:25:01.090 --> 04:25:01.930]  My skin is pretty good.
[04:25:03.730 --> 04:25:07.890]  I only use Moon Mother Hemp Company products for my face.
[04:25:07.890 --> 04:25:09.850]  Well, yeah, I mean, especially when it's your company,
[04:25:09.850 --> 04:25:12.490]  it's kind of like when we joke that you grow commercially,
[04:25:12.490 --> 04:25:15.010]  but you'd never smoke what you grow commercially.
[04:25:15.010 --> 04:25:16.450]  Well, that's crazy.
[04:25:16.450 --> 04:25:17.410]  That's crazy.
[04:25:17.410 --> 04:25:18.490]  That's kind of how a lot of people,
[04:25:18.490 --> 04:25:19.650]  especially here in Denver,
[04:25:19.650 --> 04:25:22.610]  they grow salts, but they really believe in living soil.
[04:25:22.610 --> 04:25:23.890]  I mean, I hear you.
[04:25:23.890 --> 04:25:24.970]  That's the thing.
[04:25:24.970 --> 04:25:27.690]  That's crazy that you would stand,
[04:25:27.690 --> 04:25:29.930]  work somewhere that you wouldn't really stand behind.
[04:25:29.930 --> 04:25:30.850]  That's crazy to me.
[04:25:30.850 --> 04:25:33.650]  So that's the thing about the products and the formulations.
[04:25:33.650 --> 04:25:35.810]  So all of the products that we created
[04:25:35.810 --> 04:25:38.890]  were formulated originally for a person
[04:25:38.890 --> 04:25:41.250]  who needed that formula.
[04:25:41.250 --> 04:25:42.570]  Someone we needed,
[04:25:43.930 --> 04:25:46.610]  their peel-off skin balm.
[04:25:46.610 --> 04:25:48.850]  That particular product was created
[04:25:48.850 --> 04:25:51.690]  for diaper rash for my own babies.
[04:25:51.690 --> 04:25:53.330]  The muscle balm was specifically created
[04:25:53.330 --> 04:25:54.810]  for a friend's mother who needed
[04:25:54.810 --> 04:25:58.010]  some anti-inflammatory muscle and joint pain relief.
[04:25:58.010 --> 04:26:00.730]  I mean, all of these products were created for,
[04:26:00.730 --> 04:26:01.890]  I mean, the skincare products,
[04:26:01.890 --> 04:26:03.450]  I created them for myself,
[04:26:03.450 --> 04:26:04.690]  shared them with my community,
[04:26:04.690 --> 04:26:05.570]  and when they took off,
[04:26:05.570 --> 04:26:08.290]  I shared them with my larger community.
[04:26:08.290 --> 04:26:10.250]  And that's definitely something I feel like
[04:26:10.250 --> 04:26:12.530]  the community loves you.
[04:26:12.530 --> 04:26:13.370]  I love the community.
[04:26:13.370 --> 04:26:14.810]  The Denver, especially Denver here.
[04:26:14.810 --> 04:26:17.170]  So we wanted to highlight some of these,
[04:26:18.090 --> 04:26:20.090]  is it okay if I call you a mom and pop operation?
[04:26:20.090 --> 04:26:21.250]  Yeah, we definitely are.
[04:26:21.250 --> 04:26:23.770]  Some people look at that as like a derogatory term,
[04:26:23.770 --> 04:26:25.810]  but I can't have a shopping network.
[04:26:26.730 --> 04:26:29.810]  But I do feel like there is a difference
[04:26:29.810 --> 04:26:30.810]  in the quality of stuff.
[04:26:30.810 --> 04:26:32.810]  There's some people up there that are bragging
[04:26:32.810 --> 04:26:34.770]  about how their stuff comes from China.
[04:26:36.090 --> 04:26:37.970]  There's just a lot of,
[04:26:37.970 --> 04:26:39.890]  there was a couple of people out there that just,
[04:26:39.890 --> 04:26:41.490]  we had one gentleman on here that came down
[04:26:41.490 --> 04:26:42.810]  from Colorado Breeders Depot.
[04:26:42.810 --> 04:26:45.210]  I didn't know that they grew with a living soil.
[04:26:45.210 --> 04:26:47.010]  He had purple, oracle, CBD,
[04:26:47.050 --> 04:26:52.010]  that basically looked like the bag of peel of cannabis.
[04:26:52.010 --> 04:26:53.610]  I mean, it was just unbelievably dumb.
[04:26:53.610 --> 04:26:54.450]  Yep.
[04:26:54.450 --> 04:26:56.850]  So I took a couple of years off from THC,
[04:26:56.850 --> 04:26:59.210]  and when I reintroduced THC into my life,
[04:26:59.210 --> 04:27:04.050]  I started mixing THC cannabis from our greenhouse
[04:27:04.050 --> 04:27:05.810]  into our CBD hemp flower.
[04:27:05.810 --> 04:27:07.490]  And our CBD hemp flower is off the chain.
[04:27:07.490 --> 04:27:08.930]  It's really, really good.
[04:27:08.930 --> 04:27:12.970]  So I was just rolling joints with a little sprinkle of THC
[04:27:12.970 --> 04:27:14.690]  to kind of get my tolerance back up.
[04:27:15.210 --> 04:27:16.850]  I love hemp flower.
[04:27:16.850 --> 04:27:18.810]  A bunch of my community really loves it
[04:27:18.810 --> 04:27:21.930]  and really uses it for particular times of the day.
[04:27:21.930 --> 04:27:24.210]  Like maybe you wanna have a relaxation,
[04:27:24.210 --> 04:27:25.370]  a puff, some turkeys,
[04:27:25.370 --> 04:27:28.770]  but you don't wanna really get wet.
[04:27:28.770 --> 04:27:30.970]  Yeah, we were also talking about how some people,
[04:27:30.970 --> 04:27:32.290]  maybe they've gone into a career,
[04:27:32.290 --> 04:27:34.610]  but they still like the ritual of smoking,
[04:27:34.610 --> 04:27:35.690]  especially at night.
[04:27:35.690 --> 04:27:38.570]  So that's a way that you're able to still enjoy CBD flower,
[04:27:38.570 --> 04:27:42.210]  consume that without failing a drug test.
[04:27:42.210 --> 04:27:43.410]  And that's the thing.
[04:27:43.410 --> 04:27:46.770]  When I started packing a bowl of CBD flower,
[04:27:46.770 --> 04:27:48.290]  I was like, oh, the ritual,
[04:27:48.290 --> 04:27:50.330]  the fucking ritual of like packing the bowl
[04:27:50.330 --> 04:27:51.730]  and smoking the bowl.
[04:27:51.730 --> 04:27:53.770]  And I was just like, yes.
[04:27:53.770 --> 04:27:55.570]  It had been years because I had my baby
[04:27:55.570 --> 04:27:57.650]  so I took a break from THC.
[04:27:57.650 --> 04:28:00.250]  Just personally, I was trying to like die in the back.
[04:28:00.250 --> 04:28:02.570]  And then just reintroducing that back in my life,
[04:28:02.570 --> 04:28:05.890]  I was like, oh yes, like the cannabinoids, the terpenes,
[04:28:05.890 --> 04:28:09.690]  and the ritual was so spot on.
[04:28:09.690 --> 04:28:12.850]  Just packing a bowl and smoking that in my bed before bed.
[04:28:13.290 --> 04:28:14.530]  Yes, this is-
[04:28:14.530 --> 04:28:15.770]  Especially we're both parents.
[04:28:15.770 --> 04:28:17.890]  I feel like at the end of the day,
[04:28:17.890 --> 04:28:18.970]  we need something like that
[04:28:18.970 --> 04:28:21.170]  so that we can move on into the next day,
[04:28:22.890 --> 04:28:23.730]  fully recharged.
[04:28:23.730 --> 04:28:24.570]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:28:24.570 --> 04:28:26.530]  And we need something right now.
[04:28:26.530 --> 04:28:29.010]  I don't know how many people are homeschooling their kids
[04:28:29.010 --> 04:28:30.010]  or homeschooling ours.
[04:28:30.010 --> 04:28:30.850]  It's insane.
[04:28:30.850 --> 04:28:34.650]  So reintroducing flower back into my life was crucial,
[04:28:34.650 --> 04:28:36.530]  crucial for survival of this time.
[04:28:36.530 --> 04:28:37.850]  For sure.
[04:28:37.850 --> 04:28:39.530]  So how do we find out more about you?
[04:28:39.530 --> 04:28:40.690]  How does the community,
[04:28:40.730 --> 04:28:42.850]  if they wanna try your products, reach out to you,
[04:28:42.850 --> 04:28:44.410]  what's the best ways to do that?
[04:28:44.410 --> 04:28:48.250]  Best way to do that is moonmotherhemp.com
[04:28:48.250 --> 04:28:50.610]  or find us on IG at moonmotherhempco.
[04:28:50.610 --> 04:28:51.930]  I see it says it there.

[04:28:59.130 --> 04:29:01.210]  No one said that today.
[04:29:01.210 --> 04:29:06.090]  Our entire team is just 100% community-minded,
[04:29:06.090 --> 04:29:08.210]  loves the community, loves to connect with people,
[04:29:08.210 --> 04:29:09.510]  loves to educate people.

[04:29:10.990 --> 04:29:13.350]  Our customer service team is amazing.

[04:29:15.430 --> 04:29:18.990]  Everyone, all the salespeople just on point.
[04:29:18.990 --> 04:29:21.110]  And you guys are active in the community
[04:29:21.110 --> 04:29:22.030]  as far as I can tell you,
[04:29:22.030 --> 04:29:24.590]  you're at as many expos as that you can be at.
[04:29:24.590 --> 04:29:26.670]  So you're a participant in that.
[04:29:26.670 --> 04:29:29.070]  So we appreciate that and having this event.
[04:29:29.070 --> 04:29:30.390]  Thank you for inviting me to speak.
[04:29:30.390 --> 04:29:32.230]  I didn't want to, but it's good.
[04:29:32.230 --> 04:29:33.830]  Yeah, wrestled her down here.
[04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:35.470]  And she's all the way on the top floor, by the way.
[04:29:35.470 --> 04:29:36.750]  I'm on the top, there's a top floor.
[04:29:36.750 --> 04:29:38.710]  If you only knew how far away that is.
[04:29:38.710 --> 04:29:40.350]  There's a top floor.
[04:29:40.350 --> 04:29:41.190]  If you're here.
[04:29:41.190 --> 04:29:42.870]  We weren't so bad, were we?
[04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:45.150]  No, you guys are amazing.
[04:29:45.150 --> 04:29:46.750]  But if you don't know that there's a top floor
[04:29:46.750 --> 04:29:48.670]  and you're here, please go to the top floor.
[04:29:48.670 --> 04:29:49.990]  Yeah, there's nobody up there.
[04:29:49.990 --> 04:29:51.910]  And she just told me that they didn't get like a discount.
[04:29:51.910 --> 04:29:55.390]  Can we get a cutaway to what the raging scene
[04:29:55.390 --> 04:29:56.590]  on the bottom floor?
[04:29:57.630 --> 04:29:58.470]  It's pretty bad there.
[04:29:58.470 --> 04:30:01.110]  Oh, you guys want to see how active it is?
[04:30:01.110 --> 04:30:02.150]  Mr. Daguerre.
[04:30:04.070 --> 04:30:06.870]  We got a huge live in-studio audience.
[04:30:07.230 --> 04:30:10.830]  Yeah, it's been, we're at like four and a half hours.
[04:30:10.830 --> 04:30:11.670]  Yeah.
[04:30:12.670 --> 04:30:13.750]  Look at that.
[04:30:13.750 --> 04:30:15.070]  There's the dungeon.
[04:30:15.070 --> 04:30:16.670]  It's like somebody's live stream.
[04:30:18.110 --> 04:30:20.830]  But if you go to the second floor, it's extremely active.
[04:30:20.830 --> 04:30:21.670]  Yeah.
[04:30:21.670 --> 04:30:22.510]  Which is crazy.
[04:30:22.510 --> 04:30:24.030]  Second floor is popping.
[04:30:24.030 --> 04:30:25.630]  Third floor is a little sleepy.
[04:30:25.630 --> 04:30:27.110]  Fluorescent lights.
[04:30:27.110 --> 04:30:28.790]  I'm so jealous.
[04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:30.070]  Down in the dungeon.
[04:30:31.110 --> 04:30:34.190]  My wifi, way over there.
[04:30:35.190 --> 04:30:37.510]  And Tasa is going to be here tomorrow, right?
[04:30:37.510 --> 04:30:38.350]  Oh yeah.
[04:30:38.350 --> 04:30:40.310]  Yeah, she's going to be here.
[04:30:40.310 --> 04:30:41.710]  I think Katie's going to be here too.
[04:30:41.710 --> 04:30:42.590]  Excellent.
[04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:44.310]  So we all have to come on down here
[04:30:44.310 --> 04:30:45.550]  and have a little powwow.
[04:30:47.710 --> 04:30:50.950]  So Peter, do you feel like people have gotten
[04:30:50.950 --> 04:30:54.750]  their fill of this or should I go grab someone else?
[04:30:57.150 --> 04:30:58.790]  Let the people speak.
[04:30:58.790 --> 04:30:59.750]  You know who we should find?
[04:30:59.750 --> 04:31:01.590]  Go find Dawn from Authentic Ham.
[04:31:01.590 --> 04:31:02.430]  She's a good friend of mine.
[04:31:02.470 --> 04:31:03.470]  Actually, sorry.
[04:31:03.470 --> 04:31:08.470]  I was on the phone with Rob from Seattle Chronic
[04:31:09.750 --> 04:31:14.750]  and he said his friends, Hoku Seed, were there.
[04:31:17.070 --> 04:31:18.310]  I just saw those dudes.
[04:31:18.310 --> 04:31:19.710]  I think they're on the third floor.
[04:31:19.710 --> 04:31:22.190]  Yeah, I just pinged them to see if they want to do something.
[04:31:22.190 --> 04:31:25.150]  But I mean, obviously that could be tomorrow too.
[04:31:25.150 --> 04:31:25.990]  Yeah, there's tomorrow.
[04:31:25.990 --> 04:31:28.110]  By the way, does this go until Sunday?
[04:31:28.110 --> 04:31:29.270]  No, it's just tomorrow.
[04:31:29.270 --> 04:31:30.990]  But that's what I want to ask you, Peter.
[04:31:31.030 --> 04:31:34.990]  So they have this mega room for speakers
[04:31:34.990 --> 04:31:36.790]  and today it's been all business stuff
[04:31:36.790 --> 04:31:38.630]  that I don't think our viewers would like.
[04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:42.190]  But tomorrow is all farmer, regenerative stuff.
[04:31:42.190 --> 04:31:45.190]  So we might do a lot of that recording of those speakers
[04:31:45.190 --> 04:31:49.350]  because the stage and everything is first class.
[04:31:49.350 --> 04:31:54.150]  So between now and tomorrow, the one thing to do,
[04:31:55.430 --> 04:32:00.030]  I don't know if you guys have a, what still exists,
[04:32:00.030 --> 04:32:03.510]  like a Circuit City or?
[04:32:03.510 --> 04:32:04.790]  Oh, we got Radio Shack.
[04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:05.950]  You have a Radio Shack?
[04:32:05.950 --> 04:32:08.150]  So if you can find a long-
[04:32:08.150 --> 04:32:08.990]  Pretty sure.
[04:32:09.910 --> 04:32:10.750]  These are the IT guys.
[04:32:10.750 --> 04:32:12.790]  No, I think Radio Shack is done.
[04:32:14.150 --> 04:32:16.190]  I think Best Buy is gonna be your best bet.
[04:32:16.190 --> 04:32:18.550]  So you know how you have your little shotgun mic
[04:32:18.550 --> 04:32:20.750]  that you're plugging into your lightning input
[04:32:20.750 --> 04:32:23.910]  on your iPhone?
[04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:25.710]  Yeah.
[04:32:25.710 --> 04:32:30.590]  So get like, and then you have an adapter.
[04:32:30.590 --> 04:32:34.470]  So I assume your adapter is like a mini jack
[04:32:34.470 --> 04:32:39.470]  into a mini male into a mini stereo female
[04:32:40.990 --> 04:32:43.110]  and then it's a lightning adapter.
[04:32:43.110 --> 04:32:48.110]  So if you can get a long XLR cable
[04:32:48.270 --> 04:32:51.750]  or quarter inch cable to come out of the soundboard
[04:32:51.750 --> 04:32:54.430]  and then convert it down to the mini.
[04:32:54.430 --> 04:32:55.430]  Wow, okay.
[04:32:56.190 --> 04:32:58.870]  By the way, is our audio guy paying attention?
[04:32:58.870 --> 04:32:59.710]  I'm not kidding.
[04:32:59.710 --> 04:33:01.510]  Take that to Tessa.
[04:33:01.510 --> 04:33:02.670]  Take the boxes to her.
[04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:06.270]  Anybody paying attention to me?
[04:33:06.270 --> 04:33:08.030]  No, we don't know what you're talking about.
[04:33:08.030 --> 04:33:10.470]  Anyway, we'll deal with this off.
[04:33:10.470 --> 04:33:12.350]  That guy is the guy I wanna talk to.
[04:33:12.350 --> 04:33:13.190]  There we go.
[04:33:13.190 --> 04:33:15.110]  Oh, I thought that's who you were talking to.
[04:33:15.110 --> 04:33:16.310]  Oh, yeah.
[04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:18.630]  That's who I was hoping was paying attention.
[04:33:18.630 --> 04:33:20.110]  Yeah, he's paying attention.
[04:33:20.110 --> 04:33:24.150]  So basically, instead of his little shotgun,
[04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:27.350]  which has a mini out,
[04:33:28.710 --> 04:33:33.070]  that goes into the mini to lightning adapter,
[04:33:33.070 --> 04:33:36.910]  just get a long ass XLR cable
[04:33:36.910 --> 04:33:41.630]  and then do an XLR to mini adapter
[04:33:41.630 --> 04:33:46.630]  and then the mini to lightning bolt adapter,
[04:33:49.870 --> 04:33:51.630]  if that makes any sense.
[04:33:51.630 --> 04:33:52.950]  I'll try.
[04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:54.550]  We'll talk about this off camera,
[04:33:54.550 --> 04:33:55.950]  but basically, we'll get the sound.
[04:33:55.950 --> 04:33:58.390]  My point is we'll get the soundboard audio
[04:34:00.630 --> 04:34:01.710]  and it'll be amazing.
[04:34:04.830 --> 04:34:06.830]  So anyway, with that, we can call it.
[04:34:09.030 --> 04:34:11.630]  Four and a half hours in, we can call it a day.
[04:34:13.270 --> 04:34:15.790]  Do you wanna do that last guy or what?
[04:34:15.790 --> 04:34:17.270]  What's that?
[04:34:17.270 --> 04:34:19.830]  You wanna see if those people you pinged come down?
[04:34:20.710 --> 04:34:25.550]  If Brian, I mean, if he wants to,
[04:34:25.550 --> 04:34:27.470]  if he can squeeze out one more,
[04:34:27.470 --> 04:34:30.830]  if not, we can always wrap it up.
[04:34:30.830 --> 04:34:32.710]  Magma wants more guests.
[04:34:35.150 --> 04:34:37.510]  And we do not wanna make Magma angry.
[04:34:40.910 --> 04:34:42.390]  I bet we could pull one more.
[04:34:44.550 --> 04:34:46.750]  You can wander the-
[04:34:46.750 --> 04:34:47.870]  Lemon Hoco.
[04:34:47.870 --> 04:34:48.710]  Who's Lemon Hoco?
[04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:53.350]  Is Lemon Hoco there right now in Colorado?
[04:34:55.190 --> 04:34:56.030]  Mel?
[04:35:01.750 --> 04:35:03.430]  If Mel's there.
[04:35:03.430 --> 04:35:05.870]  All right, let's get some music going.
[04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:15.830]  Yeah, I'll reach out.
[04:35:15.830 --> 04:35:17.830]  I thought Brian said he just saw those guys.
[04:35:17.830 --> 04:35:18.910]  Lemon Hoco?
[04:35:20.190 --> 04:35:21.030]  Maybe, I don't know.
[04:35:21.030 --> 04:35:21.870]  All right, hold on.
[04:35:21.870 --> 04:35:24.830]  Let me cue up the music.
[04:35:25.710 --> 04:35:26.550]  All right.
[04:35:28.470 --> 04:35:29.350]  Nice to meet you.
[04:35:40.820 --> 04:35:41.780]  What do the people want?
[04:35:41.780 --> 04:35:43.780]  Do they want me to go get the NoCoo guy?
[04:35:44.940 --> 04:35:45.780]  Huh?
[04:35:49.260 --> 04:35:50.740]  How much energy do you have left?
[04:35:50.740 --> 04:35:52.580]  Are you dying right now?
[04:35:52.620 --> 04:35:54.300]  No, man, this is for the people.
[04:35:54.300 --> 04:35:57.140]  I want live events to come back.
[04:35:57.140 --> 04:35:57.980]  That's really the main thing.
[04:35:57.980 --> 04:36:00.900]  Oh yeah, it's not Lemon Hoco, it's Hoku Seed Co.
[04:36:00.900 --> 04:36:02.780]  We're not talking about Lemon Hoco.
[04:36:07.940 --> 04:36:09.980]  But yeah, if you can find some of those,
[04:36:09.980 --> 04:36:12.060]  I mean, some of the breeders.
[04:36:12.060 --> 04:36:13.940]  For me, it's interesting just to hear
[04:36:15.060 --> 04:36:17.820]  people who are breeding towards CBD,
[04:36:17.820 --> 04:36:21.500]  like what's going on in that world?
[04:36:21.500 --> 04:36:23.300]  Kind of what are your challenges?
[04:36:23.300 --> 04:36:24.660]  What's the fun part?
[04:36:25.580 --> 04:36:26.860]  What's the market?
[04:36:26.860 --> 04:36:28.780]  I'll be honest with you, there's a lot of people up there,
[04:36:28.780 --> 04:36:30.580]  but I'm not gonna bring them down here on the show
[04:36:30.580 --> 04:36:33.900]  because the quality of the product
[04:36:33.900 --> 04:36:35.900]  that they're selling is bullshit up there.
[04:36:35.900 --> 04:36:36.740]  Right.
[04:36:36.740 --> 04:36:38.020]  It is just horrible.
[04:36:38.020 --> 04:36:39.260]  See, I'm telling you,
[04:36:39.260 --> 04:36:41.540]  I haven't found companies that make that stuff.
[04:36:41.540 --> 04:36:43.860]  Yeah, if we could find that crystalline.
[04:36:43.860 --> 04:36:45.100]  That John dude is probably the guy
[04:36:45.100 --> 04:36:46.220]  to talk to about that.
[04:36:46.220 --> 04:36:49.980]  Well, someone mentioned Brown Guy 420.
[04:36:49.980 --> 04:36:51.180]  Is he here?
[04:36:51.180 --> 04:36:52.020]  No, no, no, no,
[04:36:52.060 --> 04:36:53.980]  this is someone who-
[04:36:53.980 --> 04:36:55.340]  I've already reached out to him.
[04:36:55.340 --> 04:36:56.820]  We're gonna have him on the show for sure.
[04:36:56.820 --> 04:36:59.220]  He's somebody that I learned from.
[04:36:59.220 --> 04:37:01.780]  Well, I think for the CBD,
[04:37:01.780 --> 04:37:04.740]  the crystalline stuff you're talking about.
[04:37:04.740 --> 04:37:07.500]  Yeah, because I would love to see someone
[04:37:07.500 --> 04:37:10.380]  show me something better than that that works.
[04:37:10.380 --> 04:37:12.700]  It's H-O-K-U, right?
[04:37:12.700 --> 04:37:15.540]  Now, H-O, hold on.
[04:37:15.540 --> 04:37:19.780]  Yeah, H-O-K-U, seed co, Hoku seed co.
[04:37:19.780 --> 04:37:21.980]  All right, those dudes are also on the third floor,
[04:37:22.940 --> 04:37:23.780]  so that's gonna take me a minute.
[04:37:23.780 --> 04:37:25.740]  And you have to go around carousel style.
[04:37:25.740 --> 04:37:27.060]  They don't let you like-
[04:37:27.060 --> 04:37:29.780]  Yeah, now you feel my pain when I have to do it
[04:37:29.780 --> 04:37:31.100]  with my two rolls.
[04:37:31.100 --> 04:37:32.740]  I do it a bit every year.
[04:37:32.740 --> 04:37:33.580]  When you go into Ikea,
[04:37:33.580 --> 04:37:34.420]  you know they're like,
[04:37:34.420 --> 04:37:35.780]  no, no, you can't take the easy way.
[04:37:35.780 --> 04:37:36.900]  You can't go backwards?
[04:37:36.900 --> 04:37:37.740]  I hate that.
[04:37:37.740 --> 04:37:39.500]  I feel like I'm in a maze.
[04:37:43.180 --> 04:37:44.700]  Oh, I should have done the elevator thing, man.
[04:37:44.700 --> 04:37:45.820]  Oh, my knees.
[04:37:45.820 --> 04:37:47.020]  You know how you do this?
[04:37:49.140 --> 04:37:50.420]  That looks weird, doesn't it?
[04:37:50.420 --> 04:37:53.620]  So next time we need the talent wrangler.
[04:37:53.620 --> 04:37:55.380]  We got the technical producer,
[04:37:55.380 --> 04:37:56.740]  we got the on-air talent,
[04:37:56.740 --> 04:37:59.260]  we need the talent wrangler.
[04:37:59.260 --> 04:38:03.100]  Yeah, they're really stingy with the passes.
[04:38:03.100 --> 04:38:04.580]  You should have seen behind the scenes
[04:38:04.580 --> 04:38:06.940]  all the shit I had to do to get to Garrett.
[04:38:06.940 --> 04:38:09.740]  He was already on their system or whatever.
[04:38:09.740 --> 04:38:12.900]  So hopefully tomorrow my girl will be here
[04:38:12.900 --> 04:38:15.340]  to help behind the scenes.
[04:38:15.340 --> 04:38:18.060]  And by the way, what the two of you are doing right now
[04:38:18.060 --> 04:38:19.900]  is usually what I have to do by myself
[04:38:20.300 --> 04:38:21.820]  when I do this shit at conferences.
[04:38:21.820 --> 04:38:23.340]  I can't do this.
[04:38:23.340 --> 04:38:25.140]  I keep telling him when this all started,
[04:38:25.140 --> 04:38:26.900]  he's like, oh yeah, we'll just do the thing.
[04:38:26.900 --> 04:38:28.300]  It'll be fun, it's easy.
[04:38:28.300 --> 04:38:30.100]  It's like, fuck no, it's not.
[04:38:30.100 --> 04:38:32.500]  He's like, production, well, maybe not easy,
[04:38:32.500 --> 04:38:35.100]  but I was like, dude, production sucks the worst.
[04:38:35.100 --> 04:38:37.380]  Like middle of the show, shit will just stop.
[04:38:38.380 --> 04:38:40.180]  And you're super high too.
[04:38:40.180 --> 04:38:43.980]  So it's like, I gotta like work the cameras,
[04:38:43.980 --> 04:38:47.180]  chase people down, do the interviews.
[04:38:48.100 --> 04:38:49.420]  Get more high.
[04:38:49.940 --> 04:38:52.820]  Yeah, smoke everyone's weed.
[04:38:52.820 --> 04:38:54.060]  Don't offend anyone.
[04:38:55.940 --> 04:38:57.980]  We wouldn't offend people today, theater.
[04:39:01.900 --> 04:39:06.340]  Well, it'll be fun when we can have like an event
[04:39:06.340 --> 04:39:07.900]  where we can go live and broadcast
[04:39:07.900 --> 04:39:09.100]  while I'm getting everyone high
[04:39:09.100 --> 04:39:13.060]  so you can really see like what I can do.
[04:39:14.140 --> 04:39:16.180]  I know, we're imminent.
[04:39:16.300 --> 04:39:20.740]  We're on the one yard line of being there.
[04:39:20.740 --> 04:39:22.100]  We are.
[04:39:22.100 --> 04:39:24.660]  They said, I just went and looked at a location
[04:39:25.820 --> 04:39:26.940]  two days ago.
[04:39:26.940 --> 04:39:28.620]  I'm trying to have a 420 event.
[04:39:30.020 --> 04:39:32.300]  So this one's for you.
[04:39:33.820 --> 04:39:35.260]  This is the most I've ever heard you.
[04:39:35.260 --> 04:39:37.180]  Well, yeah, bro.
[04:39:38.660 --> 04:39:40.380]  I don't do living so that's the thing.
[04:39:40.380 --> 04:39:42.860]  Like I ain't got nothing to say, I'm there for support.
[04:39:42.860 --> 04:39:44.860]  When we talk about getting high and like hustling,
[04:39:45.020 --> 04:39:46.220]  I'm all about that.
[04:39:46.220 --> 04:39:48.580]  Yeah, well, let's have some of those conversations.
[04:39:48.580 --> 04:39:51.940]  Like Brian, Brian would be here with just a computer
[04:39:51.940 --> 04:39:53.220]  if it wasn't for me.
[04:39:53.220 --> 04:39:54.740]  He's sitting here in the dark.
[04:39:57.740 --> 04:39:58.980]  That and I'm really high.
[04:40:01.820 --> 04:40:04.740]  He didn't earn the nickname standing coma for nothing.
[04:40:04.740 --> 04:40:05.580]  Oh shit.
[04:40:08.900 --> 04:40:10.740]  Well, yeah, no, events.
[04:40:10.740 --> 04:40:15.140]  So they wanted, I got a good price point,
[04:40:15.140 --> 04:40:18.420]  but it's like, so 420 is on a Tuesday, right?
[04:40:18.420 --> 04:40:19.260]  So.
[04:40:19.260 --> 04:40:21.420]  Oh shit, yeah, no, that's only, fuck,
[04:40:21.420 --> 04:40:22.540]  yeah, three weeks away.
[04:40:22.540 --> 04:40:24.020]  Right, so you know what I wanna do?
[04:40:24.020 --> 04:40:24.860]  I didn't think about that.
[04:40:24.860 --> 04:40:26.140]  You know what I've been trying to do?
[04:40:26.140 --> 04:40:27.180]  Y'all will love this.
[04:40:27.180 --> 04:40:32.180]  I wanna smoke 420 grams from midnight to midnight on 420.
[04:40:35.260 --> 04:40:36.780]  With a group.
[04:40:36.780 --> 04:40:38.900]  Sorry, over 24 hours.
[04:40:38.900 --> 04:40:40.060]  Yes.
[04:40:40.940 --> 04:40:41.780]  Yes.
[04:40:44.300 --> 04:40:49.300]  So wubs and dubs, dabs, music, music, dabs,
[04:40:50.500 --> 04:40:51.580]  for 24 hours.
[04:40:52.660 --> 04:40:55.380]  Well, lock in, have you found like a warehouse space
[04:40:55.380 --> 04:40:56.420]  or anything?
[04:40:56.420 --> 04:40:58.500]  I found this event space, but they want,
[04:41:00.060 --> 04:41:02.460]  they're not too happy with the canvas industry
[04:41:02.460 --> 04:41:03.900]  and how we get down that event.
[04:41:03.900 --> 04:41:05.980]  So they're kind of weary because they get fined
[04:41:05.980 --> 04:41:08.420]  by the fire departments every time they have one.
[04:41:09.420 --> 04:41:13.300]  So there's, we're looking for a, yeah, strong style,
[04:41:13.300 --> 04:41:14.380]  420 grams.
[04:41:16.060 --> 04:41:16.900]  Damn right.
[04:41:17.980 --> 04:41:20.460]  But yeah, it's hard to find a spot here to do it.
[04:41:22.220 --> 04:41:24.020]  Or else I would do it every weekend.
[04:41:27.120 --> 04:41:28.120]  Yeah, no, we're.
[04:41:30.240 --> 04:41:33.800]  But they said I could do 250 people.
[04:41:36.800 --> 04:41:39.240]  And this is in Denver or where?
[04:41:39.280 --> 04:41:40.640]  Yeah, Lakewood.
[04:41:40.640 --> 04:41:44.320]  It's a place called the Baldoria on the water.
[04:41:44.320 --> 04:41:46.520]  It's like a wedding thing.
[04:41:49.320 --> 04:41:50.160]  Nice.
[04:41:53.280 --> 04:41:56.160]  Yeah, I have a space in Santa Monica
[04:41:56.160 --> 04:41:58.960]  that I was gonna pull the trigger on right before
[04:42:00.120 --> 04:42:02.160]  the shit hit the fan last March.
[04:42:03.200 --> 04:42:04.920]  And I'm kind of itching to,
[04:42:07.480 --> 04:42:08.920]  it'd be like a speakeasy.
[04:42:10.160 --> 04:42:12.240]  Well, shit, I mean, two years ago,
[04:42:12.240 --> 04:42:14.680]  me and Brian did that thing where we just put a tent up
[04:42:14.680 --> 04:42:15.880]  on the side of the road.
[04:42:17.040 --> 04:42:19.080]  Like literally a tent.
[04:42:19.080 --> 04:42:20.640]  Cause that's what we had to do.
[04:42:23.160 --> 04:42:25.480]  Cause you guys aren't in Denver, right?
[04:42:26.880 --> 04:42:29.960]  Well, this is Denver proper where we're at right now.
[04:42:29.960 --> 04:42:30.800]  But he.
[04:42:30.800 --> 04:42:33.840]  No, no, no, but where, like, where do you live in Denver?
[04:42:33.840 --> 04:42:34.960]  Are you outside Denver?
[04:42:34.960 --> 04:42:36.680]  No, I'm in Denver proper.
[04:42:36.680 --> 04:42:37.800]  He's like Aurora.
[04:42:37.800 --> 04:42:41.080]  So he's like almost to like way over there.
[04:42:41.080 --> 04:42:42.440]  And then I'm way over here.
[04:42:44.240 --> 04:42:46.920]  But yeah, we're in the Denver proper technically.
[04:42:50.440 --> 04:42:52.240]  Mapping it, Aurora.
[04:42:52.240 --> 04:42:54.280]  So when you guys do the Thursday things,
[04:42:54.280 --> 04:42:55.360]  how far do you have to drive?
[04:42:55.360 --> 04:42:57.000]  I know, it's like a suburb.
[04:42:58.280 --> 04:43:02.000]  Yeah, to go over there, it's like 60 miles round trip.
[04:43:03.880 --> 04:43:05.920]  70 miles, some shit like that.
[04:43:06.920 --> 04:43:09.720]  It's like going to the Kansas or something
[04:43:09.720 --> 04:43:11.040]  to go to Brian's house.
[04:43:11.040 --> 04:43:13.800]  So are you more on the Lakewood side of Denver?
[04:43:13.800 --> 04:43:15.320]  I'm more on the mountain side, yeah.
[04:43:15.320 --> 04:43:19.680]  I work, so I work right like damn near in the foothills
[04:43:20.760 --> 04:43:22.840]  in Arvada, Wheat Ridge area.
[04:43:24.400 --> 04:43:25.320]  My real job.
[04:43:31.380 --> 04:43:36.380]  Yeah, we need to, especially I vaccine number,
[04:43:36.740 --> 04:43:40.660]  or shot number two in two weeks or two and a half weeks.
[04:43:43.260 --> 04:43:45.540]  By the way, everyone, this is our test case.
[04:43:45.540 --> 04:43:47.780]  Brian's either gonna be,
[04:43:47.780 --> 04:43:51.340]  we're gonna be reading super spreader stories
[04:43:51.340 --> 04:43:54.580]  from Denver, Colorado or not.
[04:43:55.660 --> 04:43:57.060]  Yeah, so that's shot two.
[04:43:57.060 --> 04:44:01.100]  Yeah, I guess National Denver Complex is in Commerce City.
[04:44:01.980 --> 04:44:03.900]  You're probably right, yeah.
[04:44:03.940 --> 04:44:08.260]  Also, Commerce City, I've been looking here for warehouses.
[04:44:08.260 --> 04:44:09.940]  There's lots of potential in this area
[04:44:09.940 --> 04:44:13.500]  to get a little weird, that's for sure.
[04:44:23.890 --> 04:44:24.730]  I love that.
[04:44:24.730 --> 04:44:26.290]  So every time Brian grabs someone,
[04:44:26.290 --> 04:44:29.170]  he has to run up like three flights of stairs?
[04:44:29.170 --> 04:44:31.530]  Yeah, that boy's doing work today.
[04:44:33.450 --> 04:44:35.210]  I've been there many times.
[04:44:35.210 --> 04:44:36.250]  Yeah, Little Lake.
[04:44:47.100 --> 04:44:48.220]  Yeah, there's nobody down here.
[04:44:48.220 --> 04:44:51.540]  This is, they could have put us somewhere else.
[04:44:55.180 --> 04:44:58.060]  Raul, I'm trying to interpret in plain English
[04:44:58.060 --> 04:45:00.940]  your are you serious vaccines are a business
[04:45:00.940 --> 04:45:02.380]  and best in your needs.
[04:45:02.380 --> 04:45:03.220]  Well, all right.
[04:45:04.140 --> 04:45:08.300]  Yeah, my wife demanded that I get the vaccine.
[04:45:09.780 --> 04:45:11.900]  So Raul, if you wanna fight with my wife,
[04:45:13.940 --> 04:45:16.740]  or deal with her on a daily basis
[04:45:16.740 --> 04:45:20.260]  after rejecting her demand that I get the vaccine.
[04:45:21.660 --> 04:45:23.380]  Happy wife is a happy life.
[04:45:23.380 --> 04:45:27.740]  You can stand in during all the yelling and lecturing.
[04:45:40.040 --> 04:45:42.840]  That's probably why it's all pixelated to the concrete.
[04:45:42.840 --> 04:45:45.200]  I was thinking also, I mean,
[04:45:47.720 --> 04:45:52.720]  if we had like something to dampen the noise
[04:45:52.880 --> 04:45:54.280]  on that back wall,
[04:45:57.480 --> 04:45:59.440]  cause like when the PA systems booming,
[04:45:59.440 --> 04:46:01.160]  you basically got that concrete wall
[04:46:01.160 --> 04:46:03.320]  right behind the microphone.
[04:46:06.760 --> 04:46:07.600]  Yeah, it's just-
[04:46:07.600 --> 04:46:11.070]  Patrick, the truth in that statement's irrelevant
[04:46:11.070 --> 04:46:12.790]  when you're dealing with a vaccine.
[04:46:12.830 --> 04:46:14.630]  It's irrelevant when you're dealing with a wife
[04:46:14.630 --> 04:46:19.630]  who has an unlimited ability to lecture
[04:46:19.670 --> 04:46:22.550]  for long periods of time and nag.
[04:46:24.910 --> 04:46:25.750]  Do what I want.
[04:46:28.710 --> 04:46:30.150]  That's a tough one.
[04:46:30.150 --> 04:46:31.550]  You pick your battles.
[04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:38.030]  Yeah, it's weird.
[04:46:38.030 --> 04:46:39.510]  I wonder, there's been rumors
[04:46:39.510 --> 04:46:42.510]  of they won't let people do events here
[04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:46.230]  unless you are vaccinated or have like proof of vaccine
[04:46:46.230 --> 04:46:47.910]  or something that's been rumored.
[04:46:49.350 --> 04:46:53.390]  Like impending regulation?
[04:46:55.550 --> 04:46:58.590]  Like that may happen.
[04:46:58.590 --> 04:47:01.510]  Some people have had events and they're,
[04:47:01.510 --> 04:47:03.670]  you know, they got to bring a vaccine thing,
[04:47:03.670 --> 04:47:04.790]  but I'll check it out.
[04:47:09.070 --> 04:47:09.910]  Come on, bro.
[04:47:10.870 --> 04:47:12.830]  Got your boy Floyd.
[04:47:12.830 --> 04:47:13.670]  Pretty boy Floyd.
[04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:15.430]  Have you messed up on here or what?
[04:47:15.430 --> 04:47:17.430]  No, you don't have to be messed up.
[04:47:17.430 --> 04:47:20.990]  This way you can hear Peter ask a question or something.
[04:47:20.990 --> 04:47:23.190]  That is obviously Peter there on the side.
[04:47:23.190 --> 04:47:24.510]  That is the chat.
[04:47:24.510 --> 04:47:26.430]  And that is where they were asking for you, sir.
[04:47:26.430 --> 04:47:29.310]  So excited to have somebody that could go grab.
[04:47:29.310 --> 04:47:31.190]  This dude again is on the third floor.
[04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:34.510]  If you people only know how fucking far that is.
[04:47:34.510 --> 04:47:36.510]  Are you Hoku Seeds?
[04:47:36.510 --> 04:47:37.470]  Yeah, that's me.
[04:47:37.470 --> 04:47:41.190]  Yeah, me and one other guy, my father-in-law, Gary.
[04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:42.030]  He's up holding down the booth.
[04:47:42.030 --> 04:47:43.110]  Which I just met.
[04:47:43.110 --> 04:47:46.470]  So I was on the phone with Seattle Chronic
[04:47:46.470 --> 04:47:49.070]  who told me to hit you up because you were there.
[04:47:49.070 --> 04:47:51.390]  Yeah, yeah, it's a bummer he couldn't make it,
[04:47:51.390 --> 04:47:52.630]  but I know he wanted to be here.
[04:47:52.630 --> 04:47:56.270]  But we got some of his packs
[04:47:56.270 --> 04:47:58.230]  that we got up at our booth on the third floor.
[04:47:58.230 --> 04:48:01.590]  So if anybody wants some Seattle Chronic, come hit us up.
[04:48:01.590 --> 04:48:03.550]  We got some other stuff.
[04:48:03.550 --> 04:48:06.390]  It's a low lab valley crossed with some modern hybrids.
[04:48:06.390 --> 04:48:08.670]  We got some land races.
[04:48:08.670 --> 04:48:12.310]  Of course, all of our mixed ratio CBD, CBG,
[04:48:12.310 --> 04:48:13.910]  some auto flowers.
[04:48:13.910 --> 04:48:15.470]  But yeah, I'm open.
[04:48:15.470 --> 04:48:16.870]  What's going on guys?
[04:48:16.870 --> 04:48:17.710]  Rob?
[04:48:18.710 --> 04:48:20.510]  Let's talk about some of your genetics.
[04:48:20.510 --> 04:48:23.510]  I mean, obviously, certain people are giving you a shout out
[04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:24.350]  that's a cosign.
[04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:27.510]  In our community, that's better than really anything
[04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:29.230]  in marketing is when you can get a cosign
[04:48:29.230 --> 04:48:30.110]  from someone like that.
[04:48:30.110 --> 04:48:31.790]  So let's talk about more like
[04:48:31.790 --> 04:48:33.950]  when you're thinking about breeding,
[04:48:33.950 --> 04:48:35.230]  when you're running through your lines,
[04:48:35.350 --> 04:48:37.030]  what are some of the stuff that you feel like
[04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:38.790]  you could give the viewers that you've noticed
[04:48:38.790 --> 04:48:41.150]  throughout the years of your experience?
[04:48:41.150 --> 04:48:43.790]  So my, kind of where I'm coming from is,
[04:48:43.790 --> 04:48:45.150]  I mean, I've always had an interest
[04:48:45.150 --> 04:48:46.630]  in some of the minor cannabinoids,
[04:48:46.630 --> 04:48:48.750]  which we're starting to see,
[04:48:48.750 --> 04:48:52.830]  be focused on a little more with the legalization of hemp.
[04:48:52.830 --> 04:48:55.550]  You kind of have the freedom to grow large numbers
[04:48:55.550 --> 04:48:59.670]  and kind of without the fear of law enforcement
[04:48:59.670 --> 04:49:00.510]  coming down on you.
[04:49:00.510 --> 04:49:02.790]  But, and literally with hemp,
[04:49:02.790 --> 04:49:07.790]  the only cannabinoid that we can't grow is THC,
[04:49:08.070 --> 04:49:08.910]  is Delta-9.
[04:49:08.910 --> 04:49:12.470]  So basically everything else is on the table.
[04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:15.390]  And so that's kind of where we've been focused,
[04:49:15.390 --> 04:49:17.670]  kind of our interest, CBD,
[04:49:17.670 --> 04:49:21.110]  it started with a mixed ratio, CBD, THC,
[04:49:22.230 --> 04:49:24.670]  mostly just for the medical benefit.
[04:49:24.670 --> 04:49:28.070]  We were seeing a lot of people that really didn't,
[04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:30.350]  were kind of put off of THC
[04:49:30.350 --> 04:49:32.630]  because they didn't really want the high per se,
[04:49:33.470 --> 04:49:36.390]  but they really needed some good plant-based medicine.
[04:49:36.390 --> 04:49:38.510]  We started giving them a little bit of mixed ratio,
[04:49:38.510 --> 04:49:40.470]  CBD, THC, and people could tolerate it.
[04:49:40.470 --> 04:49:43.550]  And that's kind of where my interest lied.
[04:49:43.550 --> 04:49:46.310]  And so I started kind of diving down
[04:49:46.310 --> 04:49:47.990]  the CBD rabbit hole, breeding,
[04:49:49.110 --> 04:49:50.950]  new CBD into THC,
[04:49:50.950 --> 04:49:52.750]  and then with the legalization of hemp,
[04:49:52.750 --> 04:49:54.270]  kind of focusing on that.
[04:49:54.270 --> 04:49:58.070]  And now, CBG, THC-B, CBD-B,
[04:49:59.190 --> 04:50:02.070]  in my perspective and kind of where I align,
[04:50:02.510 --> 04:50:05.030]  even with the RAB from Seattle Chronic
[04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:08.590]  is the medical aspect of getting kind of
[04:50:08.590 --> 04:50:10.870]  the entourage effect of these different cannabinoids
[04:50:10.870 --> 04:50:12.470]  and seeing what they can do for folks.
[04:50:12.470 --> 04:50:13.350]  And I'll tell you what, man,
[04:50:13.350 --> 04:50:16.110]  CBG for any kind of gut issue, Crohn's,
[04:50:16.110 --> 04:50:17.430]  it's a game changer.
[04:50:17.430 --> 04:50:19.990]  So if any of you guys out there have any gut issues,
[04:50:19.990 --> 04:50:22.310]  man, CBG, it doesn't get you high,
[04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:26.510]  but yeah, it'll definitely solve some of your
[04:50:26.510 --> 04:50:27.670]  medical issues.
[04:50:27.670 --> 04:50:28.510]  I will say this too,
[04:50:28.510 --> 04:50:31.910]  if you do intermittent fasting to what's known as autophagy,
[04:50:32.910 --> 04:50:34.470]  and then you use CBG with autophagy
[04:50:34.470 --> 04:50:36.070]  and you're disciplined enough to do that,
[04:50:36.070 --> 04:50:39.190]  I promise you, your life is going to change.
[04:50:40.710 --> 04:50:42.030]  And you don't need Crohn's or all this stuff
[04:50:42.030 --> 04:50:44.270]  just to feel healthy in general.
[04:50:44.270 --> 04:50:47.230]  There's something to just the whole process
[04:50:47.230 --> 04:50:48.550]  of understanding that,
[04:50:48.550 --> 04:50:50.510]  almost kind of what I feel like you're alluding to here
[04:50:50.510 --> 04:50:52.790]  is that this is kind of like the second brain.
[04:50:52.790 --> 04:50:54.630]  And as long as you are able to feed that
[04:50:54.630 --> 04:50:56.310]  with the right nutrients as well,
[04:50:57.750 --> 04:51:01.710]  these things seem to have that symbiotic relationship
[04:51:02.470 --> 04:51:04.230]  that once used to be there when you were a child.
[04:51:04.230 --> 04:51:05.550]  Oh yeah, no, absolutely.
[04:51:05.550 --> 04:51:06.830]  And I mean, our bodies,
[04:51:06.830 --> 04:51:09.110]  we all have a endocannabinoid system, right?
[04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:10.230]  Every mammal on the planet.
[04:51:10.230 --> 04:51:12.390]  So I mean, if you've been cultivating cannabis
[04:51:12.390 --> 04:51:13.910]  for forever, right?
[04:51:13.910 --> 04:51:17.110]  I mean, they're finding it thousands and tens of thousands
[04:51:17.110 --> 04:51:21.030]  of years in burial places.
[04:51:21.030 --> 04:51:23.230]  So it's like, we know,
[04:51:23.230 --> 04:51:25.710]  I don't know if we need the plant more than it needs us,
[04:51:25.710 --> 04:51:27.510]  but I mean, obviously we do have relationship
[04:51:27.510 --> 04:51:29.510]  and I mean, it's a powerful plant.
[04:51:29.550 --> 04:51:33.790]  So, and I mean, you're seeing just these crude extracts
[04:51:33.790 --> 04:51:36.110]  crush pharmaceuticals on a lot of levels,
[04:51:36.110 --> 04:51:37.950]  so I mean, that should speak volumes.
[04:51:38.990 --> 04:51:40.550]  And we really, it's all anecdotal.
[04:51:40.550 --> 04:51:41.870]  Like we don't really know,
[04:51:41.870 --> 04:51:43.990]  there's not a lot of research into what these do.
[04:51:43.990 --> 04:51:47.030]  So it's kind of our job before big pharma gets in there
[04:51:47.030 --> 04:51:48.710]  and playing around and kind of seeing,
[04:51:48.710 --> 04:51:50.710]  okay, well, what does that, how does that help you?
[04:51:50.710 --> 04:51:51.550]  You know what I mean?
[04:51:51.550 --> 04:51:54.150]  We all know what cannabis and kind of,
[04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:55.390]  Delta 9 does for us.
[04:51:55.390 --> 04:51:57.430]  I mean, and we love it, right?
[04:51:57.430 --> 04:52:00.190]  But mixing in some of these other miners and stuff
[04:52:00.190 --> 04:52:02.030]  and seeing what that can do.
[04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:04.550]  And even not even for the medical aspect,
[04:52:04.550 --> 04:52:06.430]  I mean, people that haven't really tried
[04:52:06.430 --> 04:52:08.830]  some of these one-to-ones like CBD and THC,
[04:52:08.830 --> 04:52:11.870]  I mean, the headspace that you get is pretty enjoyable.
[04:52:11.870 --> 04:52:16.470]  You know, I mean, it's, I personally enjoy one-to-ones
[04:52:16.470 --> 04:52:18.830]  more often than just pure THC.
[04:52:18.830 --> 04:52:22.710]  So, and that's to each their own kind of like,
[04:52:22.710 --> 04:52:24.550]  you enjoy what you enjoy.
[04:52:24.550 --> 04:52:27.410]  But I think a lot of people have this kind of,
[04:52:27.410 --> 04:52:29.790]  maybe connotation that they're missing out,
[04:52:29.790 --> 04:52:31.630]  or kind of taken away from their high,
[04:52:31.630 --> 04:52:33.310]  but it's like, if you really pay attention
[04:52:33.310 --> 04:52:35.150]  to subtle differences, which,
[04:52:35.150 --> 04:52:39.350]  the terpenes and the different kind of sativa, indica,
[04:52:39.350 --> 04:52:42.270]  I mean, everything kind of plays a role,
[04:52:42.270 --> 04:52:43.830]  and if you like a certain terpene profile,
[04:52:43.830 --> 04:52:46.750]  because the way it makes you feel,
[04:52:46.750 --> 04:52:48.870]  imagine like a one-to-one-to-one or something,
[04:52:48.870 --> 04:52:49.710]  you know what I mean?
[04:52:49.710 --> 04:52:51.750]  And it's all, it's really because not a lot of people
[04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:52.630]  have had access to it.
[04:52:52.630 --> 04:52:55.030]  And that's kind of what my main objective is,
[04:52:55.030 --> 04:52:57.310]  is to like, you know, free the seed almost,
[04:52:57.310 --> 04:53:00.030]  like give people access to affordable, you know,
[04:53:00.030 --> 04:53:03.670]  kind of like seed that they can go in and run with
[04:53:03.670 --> 04:53:05.230]  and try the, you know, THC-B.
[04:53:05.230 --> 04:53:06.990]  I saw somebody had a question about the,
[04:53:06.990 --> 04:53:09.090]  like the one-to-one cut that we've got,
[04:53:09.090 --> 04:53:10.690]  and we're working with.
[04:53:10.690 --> 04:53:15.150]  We also have, I just got ahold of some land-raised seeds
[04:53:15.150 --> 04:53:17.870]  that are supposed to have testing,
[04:53:17.870 --> 04:53:21.310]  the test results that I saw from them was a 5% CBD
[04:53:21.310 --> 04:53:26.070]  and a 7% THC-B that finished with compliant Delta 9 levels.
[04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:27.950]  So it could be grown as hemp.
[04:53:27.950 --> 04:53:30.550]  It finishes under 10 weeks, so no more, you know,
[04:53:30.550 --> 04:53:32.950]  land-raised, you know, flowering times.
[04:53:32.950 --> 04:53:35.790]  Yeah, dude, and it's, and I mean, you know,
[04:53:35.790 --> 04:53:37.470]  it's finished under 10 weeks.
[04:53:37.470 --> 04:53:39.150]  I think it's, some of them are auto flowers.
[04:53:39.150 --> 04:53:42.990]  So, I mean, as a breeder, it's like a goldmine for,
[04:53:42.990 --> 04:53:45.470]  you know, potential, you know, if you've got autos,
[04:53:45.470 --> 04:53:48.630]  you've got THC-B, CBD, and then, you know,
[04:53:48.630 --> 04:53:50.310]  compliant, you know, Delta 9.
[04:53:50.310 --> 04:53:52.910]  I mean, because you can always add Delta 9 back in there,
[04:53:52.910 --> 04:53:55.990]  you know, so it's, dude, the future is bright.
[04:53:55.990 --> 04:53:58.430]  Like anybody that's interested in breeding
[04:53:58.430 --> 04:54:00.910]  and hemp in particular, I mean,
[04:54:00.910 --> 04:54:01.750]  and what's happening, man,
[04:54:01.750 --> 04:54:03.390]  is these industries are converging.
[04:54:03.390 --> 04:54:06.310]  It's not gonna be hemp and cannabis, you know,
[04:54:06.310 --> 04:54:08.710]  it's one plant, and that's what people forget, you know?
[04:54:08.710 --> 04:54:10.630]  So like these arbitrary definition of,
[04:54:10.630 --> 04:54:12.190]  oh, what's hemp and what's cannabis?
[04:54:12.190 --> 04:54:13.390]  It's like, that's all man-made.
[04:54:13.390 --> 04:54:15.990]  So this plant, and the cool thing too,
[04:54:15.990 --> 04:54:17.210]  is like with those one-to-ones,
[04:54:17.210 --> 04:54:19.110]  it's like, that's what mother nature offers us.
[04:54:19.110 --> 04:54:20.390]  Like if you go back into some of these
[04:54:20.390 --> 04:54:22.330]  Indian land-raised populations,
[04:54:22.330 --> 04:54:24.710]  they are, you know, there's mixed, you know,
[04:54:24.710 --> 04:54:27.470]  high CBD, high THC, mixed one-to-ones,
[04:54:27.470 --> 04:54:29.150]  and like a lot of the hash that like,
[04:54:29.150 --> 04:54:30.310]  you know, the old heads talk about,
[04:54:30.310 --> 04:54:31.590]  well, the weed's too strong to dance.
[04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:33.050]  It's maybe, you know, maybe,
[04:54:33.050 --> 04:54:35.470]  it is because we kind of bred out the CBD, you know?
[04:54:35.470 --> 04:54:38.670]  They were probably smoking mixed chemotype hash
[04:54:38.670 --> 04:54:39.790]  and bud back in the day,
[04:54:39.790 --> 04:54:41.310]  and they just didn't even realize it, you know?
[04:54:41.310 --> 04:54:44.430]  So it's like, if mother nature wants it that way,
[04:54:44.430 --> 04:54:46.110]  I mean, I don't know, you know?
[04:54:46.110 --> 04:54:47.230]  I mean, there's something to be said.
[04:54:47.230 --> 04:54:52.190]  So, yeah, I mean, I just love the gamut of it.
[04:54:52.190 --> 04:54:53.150]  I love breeding for it.
[04:54:53.150 --> 04:54:55.470]  I love being able to offer people these seeds, you know?
[04:54:55.470 --> 04:54:57.110]  And I have an obsession.
[04:54:57.110 --> 04:54:59.270]  I mean, you guys are here doing this.
[04:54:59.270 --> 04:55:01.030]  I'm sure you're obsessed with the plant, you know?
[04:55:01.030 --> 04:55:02.990]  I mean, just in different ways, right?
[04:55:02.990 --> 04:55:04.070]  Yeah, I'm sure everybody here
[04:55:04.070 --> 04:55:06.150]  can talk about how it's changed their life.
[04:55:06.150 --> 04:55:08.350]  Oh, dude, we can all go, right?
[04:55:08.350 --> 04:55:10.350]  And look, it's brought us all together, you know?
[04:55:10.350 --> 04:55:12.910]  So I mean, you can go anywhere in the world,
[04:55:12.910 --> 04:55:14.150]  not even speak the same language
[04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:15.350]  but if you share a joint with somebody,
[04:55:16.110 --> 04:55:17.310]  you got a bond with them, you know?
[04:55:17.310 --> 04:55:21.070]  So, yeah, I don't know.
[04:55:21.070 --> 04:55:22.630]  I mean, we're here to stay, you know?
[04:55:22.630 --> 04:55:24.230]  I mean, I'm not here trying to, you know,
[04:55:24.230 --> 04:55:26.390]  I mean, obviously it'd be good to make some money, you know,
[04:55:26.390 --> 04:55:28.390]  and do this for a living and that's kind of the goal
[04:55:28.390 --> 04:55:31.750]  but I love the plant, you know?
[04:55:31.750 --> 04:55:33.390]  And yeah, I'll be here, you know,
[04:55:33.390 --> 04:55:34.990]  kind of trying to push the envelope.
[04:55:34.990 --> 04:55:36.790]  I know Rob, Seattle Chronic,
[04:55:36.790 --> 04:55:39.390]  I mean, we're on the same level, you know?
[04:55:39.390 --> 04:55:40.630]  I think we've got, you know,
[04:55:40.630 --> 04:55:43.230]  we're gonna have some one-to-ones coming out soon
[04:55:43.270 --> 04:55:45.630]  with some of his breeder's cuts.
[04:55:47.350 --> 04:55:51.150]  He was, you know, kind enough to let out, so yeah.
[04:55:51.150 --> 04:55:52.550]  No, it's cool, man.
[04:55:52.550 --> 04:55:55.350]  So I don't know if anybody's got any questions or what.
[04:55:56.550 --> 04:55:58.270]  You know, a variety of the people, yeah,
[04:55:58.270 --> 04:56:00.670]  they kind of want to know again, like more,
[04:56:00.670 --> 04:56:02.990]  like when you're going through your line
[04:56:02.990 --> 04:56:03.990]  and you're looking at the males,
[04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:05.390]  I feel like that's the biggest question
[04:56:05.390 --> 04:56:06.870]  I get in the DM a lot is,
[04:56:06.870 --> 04:56:10.110]  if the community knows I'm gonna talk to a breeder,
[04:56:10.110 --> 04:56:11.870]  they want to know more about, well, autos.
[04:56:11.870 --> 04:56:13.670]  We were talking to a gentleman yesterday actually
[04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:16.750]  about that, that opened my eyes to some of that as well.
[04:56:16.750 --> 04:56:20.190]  And then of course, just genetics in general,
[04:56:20.190 --> 04:56:21.950]  I mean, the way that you're viewing things
[04:56:21.950 --> 04:56:23.910]  as you're breeding.
[04:56:23.910 --> 04:56:26.830]  So yeah, I mean, and hemp breeding is a little different
[04:56:26.830 --> 04:56:30.070]  because the majority of them tend to want feminized seeds,
[04:56:30.070 --> 04:56:32.990]  you know, so generally you're selecting a pollen donor
[04:56:32.990 --> 04:56:34.430]  versus like a true male.
[04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:37.830]  But I mean, we can talk about that.
[04:56:37.830 --> 04:56:41.590]  I mean, you know, it kind of depends on what, you know,
[04:56:42.270 --> 04:56:43.110]  what you're looking for.
[04:56:43.110 --> 04:56:45.590]  I mean, hemp and then, you know,
[04:56:45.590 --> 04:56:46.950]  it goes down another rabbit hole, right?
[04:56:46.950 --> 04:56:49.430]  Because like we've even shifted our gears
[04:56:49.430 --> 04:56:51.430]  and what our breeding goals were for
[04:56:51.430 --> 04:56:52.990]  just within the last two years.
[04:56:52.990 --> 04:56:54.150]  Like, so when we got into it,
[04:56:54.150 --> 04:56:57.030]  we were breeding more for field production,
[04:56:57.910 --> 04:56:58.990]  you know, which is outdoor.
[04:56:58.990 --> 04:57:01.190]  So you want, you know, early flowering plants
[04:57:01.190 --> 04:57:03.910]  that are, you know, especially for the Pacific Northwest,
[04:57:03.910 --> 04:57:05.710]  you want, you know, mold resistance.
[04:57:06.870 --> 04:57:08.710]  But all that's changing right now,
[04:57:08.750 --> 04:57:11.830]  because like what I see in the hemp industry
[04:57:11.830 --> 04:57:14.190]  is a lot of the, you know,
[04:57:14.190 --> 04:57:17.150]  the biomass prices are bottoming out, oil prices.
[04:57:17.150 --> 04:57:18.270]  You can't give that shit away.
[04:57:18.270 --> 04:57:21.550]  So it's like, what's really coming down, you know,
[04:57:21.550 --> 04:57:22.950]  the smokeable flower, right?
[04:57:22.950 --> 04:57:24.990]  So premium flower, like people want,
[04:57:24.990 --> 04:57:25.990]  you don't want to smoke hemp,
[04:57:25.990 --> 04:57:27.950]  you want it to taste, you know,
[04:57:27.950 --> 04:57:31.670]  and smell and like cannabis, you know,
[04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:34.790]  with, you know, apart from the chemical constituents.
[04:57:34.790 --> 04:57:37.990]  So I don't think it's any,
[04:57:38.030 --> 04:57:39.310]  like, so at that aspect,
[04:57:39.310 --> 04:57:41.310]  that's going to be similar to what a breeder
[04:57:41.310 --> 04:57:43.030]  in the cannabis side is looking for, you know?
[04:57:43.030 --> 04:57:46.790]  So, I mean, you know, stability, terpene profile, structure,
[04:57:46.790 --> 04:57:48.390]  because you're going to be reversing that pollen donor.
[04:57:48.390 --> 04:57:49.870]  You want to do some stress tests,
[04:57:49.870 --> 04:57:53.430]  make sure it doesn't have any, you know, intersex traits,
[04:57:53.430 --> 04:57:55.230]  you know, because obviously if you reverse that
[04:57:55.230 --> 04:57:57.790]  and you're not really sure, you know, I mean,
[04:57:57.790 --> 04:57:58.830]  you could pass along, you know,
[04:57:58.830 --> 04:58:00.790]  because it could hurt me while, you know,
[04:58:00.790 --> 04:58:02.990]  you've created to produce pollen.
[04:58:02.990 --> 04:58:04.150]  For males,
[04:58:04.390 --> 04:58:05.230]  um,
[04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:07.310]  shut up Floyd.
[04:58:07.310 --> 04:58:09.430]  What's up Rob?
[04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:10.270]  Yeah.
[04:58:10.270 --> 04:58:11.110]  Uh,
[04:58:11.110 --> 04:58:12.950]  You know, Mr. Toe, we've had him on the show.
[04:58:12.950 --> 04:58:15.070]  I feel like he's an OG that definitely deserves a shout out.
[04:58:15.070 --> 04:58:19.150]  Oh, Mr. Toe, Slovak, Slovenian CBG, auto.
[04:58:19.150 --> 04:58:20.070]  Hell yeah.
[04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:21.030]  Yup.
[04:58:21.030 --> 04:58:24.750]  I'm telling you guys the, the land races for hemp breeders,
[04:58:24.750 --> 04:58:26.070]  that's where it's all at.
[04:58:26.070 --> 04:58:28.310]  I mean, that's like the well-kept secret, man.
[04:58:28.310 --> 04:58:29.870]  I mean, you, you could grow out some,
[04:58:29.870 --> 04:58:33.550]  some freaking land races and find a compliant, you know,
[04:58:33.910 --> 04:58:34.750]  find compliant hemp.
[04:58:34.750 --> 04:58:37.990]  I mean, that's so, um, but yeah, for the males.
[04:58:37.990 --> 04:58:39.230]  And I mean, that's, that's one thing too.
[04:58:39.230 --> 04:58:41.670]  So I never realized to like to reverse a feminine,
[04:58:41.670 --> 04:58:44.510]  like a feminized female, you know, I want both chromosomes.
[04:58:44.510 --> 04:58:47.270]  So I always like I'll make my selections
[04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:48.550]  for my regular population.
[04:58:48.550 --> 04:58:51.670]  And so like people are always surprised that I offer like
[04:58:51.670 --> 04:58:54.590]  regular CBD seeds, but it's like, for one, you know,
[04:58:54.590 --> 04:58:56.270]  I mean, that's the starting material.
[04:58:56.270 --> 04:58:58.590]  And I know there's other breeders that they don't care.
[04:58:58.590 --> 04:58:59.550]  And it's like all fat,
[04:58:59.550 --> 04:59:02.230]  like there's not a male in their facility.
[04:59:02.230 --> 04:59:04.510]  But with the males, you know, I mean, for, yeah, it's,
[04:59:04.510 --> 04:59:08.310]  it's your breeding, you know, it's the building materials,
[04:59:08.310 --> 04:59:09.950]  but also, I mean, like you said, you can,
[04:59:09.950 --> 04:59:11.630]  now you can take those males.
[04:59:11.630 --> 04:59:15.910]  And I mean, I can work those high CBD males into,
[04:59:15.910 --> 04:59:17.270]  you know, THC lines.
[04:59:17.270 --> 04:59:20.310]  I mean, I can kind of go a bunch of different routes,
[04:59:20.310 --> 04:59:23.710]  but yeah, I mean, males, I mean, for hemp,
[04:59:23.710 --> 04:59:25.590]  the number one is obviously, you know,
[04:59:25.590 --> 04:59:26.750]  like your chemo type.
[04:59:26.750 --> 04:59:30.110]  If it's, if it's over, you know, if it's going to test hot,
[04:59:30.110 --> 04:59:31.110]  a lot of people just,
[04:59:31.110 --> 04:59:32.550]  it's not even going to be an option for them.
[04:59:32.550 --> 04:59:34.990]  They don't want to have to think about testing early
[04:59:34.990 --> 04:59:37.830]  or stressing it out and going hot.
[04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:40.390]  So that would be probably your number one is doing like a
[04:59:40.390 --> 04:59:41.590]  leaf test or, you know,
[04:59:41.590 --> 04:59:44.150]  flowering it out and making sure your male is going to be
[04:59:44.150 --> 04:59:44.990]  compliant.
[04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:47.510]  And again, you know,
[04:59:47.510 --> 04:59:49.670]  it goes back to the only way to know for sure, you know,
[04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:52.830]  the male is to grow the progeny out and test the progeny.
[04:59:53.870 --> 04:59:56.190]  But, and then it's just your basic morphology, you know,
[04:59:56.190 --> 04:59:58.230]  the male, does it have the structure, you know,
[04:59:58.470 --> 05:00:00.910]  does it have the terpene profile that you like?
[05:00:01.950 --> 05:00:03.150]  What, you know, does it stack?
[05:00:03.150 --> 05:00:04.590]  I mean, does it produce a lot of pollen?
[05:00:04.590 --> 05:00:07.390]  You know, I mean, you know, a lot of guys, you know,
[05:00:07.390 --> 05:00:09.550]  a lot of people won't use the males that show first.
[05:00:09.550 --> 05:00:11.870]  And I, I tend to not, I mean, if they're showing, you know,
[05:00:11.870 --> 05:00:14.270]  right away in veg, I just toss them, you know?
[05:00:14.270 --> 05:00:17.830]  So I, I don't know if, you know,
[05:00:17.830 --> 05:00:18.990]  that's the right thing to do or not.
[05:00:18.990 --> 05:00:21.510]  Maybe I'm missing out on something, but, but yeah, I just,
[05:00:21.510 --> 05:00:23.150]  I just like the ones that tend to show, you know,
[05:00:23.150 --> 05:00:27.710]  tend to take a little longer and females do for that matter.
[05:00:28.230 --> 05:00:32.070]  But, but yeah, I mean, I, you know, like I said,
[05:00:32.070 --> 05:00:34.030]  hemp, it's always, it comes down to chemotype.
[05:00:34.030 --> 05:00:35.270]  You know, you're always have to be testing
[05:00:35.270 --> 05:00:38.150]  for your Delta nine levels, even if you're like right now,
[05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:41.310]  you know, our, one of our big projects is working
[05:00:41.310 --> 05:00:43.870]  biscotti over to a CV line, you know?
[05:00:43.870 --> 05:00:45.390]  So we did the one, one cross,
[05:00:45.390 --> 05:00:46.990]  and now we're going to have to grow those out
[05:00:46.990 --> 05:00:49.390]  and make selections and then either, you know,
[05:00:49.390 --> 05:00:51.230]  decide if, do we want to S1 that,
[05:00:51.230 --> 05:00:54.550]  self it and pollinate itself, or do we want to, you know,
[05:00:54.550 --> 05:00:57.190]  use two different females and cross those
[05:00:57.710 --> 05:00:59.950]  and then dive into those and look for the type threes,
[05:00:59.950 --> 05:01:01.790]  you know, so a couple of generations.
[05:01:01.790 --> 05:01:04.550]  And then also, you know, if we want that flavor,
[05:01:04.550 --> 05:01:07.550]  so say I want a biscotti, you know, flavored hemp variety,
[05:01:07.550 --> 05:01:09.590]  then that's what I'm going to be breeding for, you know?
[05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:12.630]  I mean, even if I have to take a roundabout way, you know,
[05:01:12.630 --> 05:01:16.190]  maybe my, you know, the ones that are the highest in CBD
[05:01:16.190 --> 05:01:18.230]  don't have that profile, you know, but you can get there.
[05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:19.390]  It might just take a little longer.
[05:01:19.390 --> 05:01:24.110]  So, I mean, it's all, it, everybody's going to,
[05:01:24.110 --> 05:01:25.390]  everybody's going to have different goals
[05:01:25.390 --> 05:01:26.950]  and that's kind of what's going to set
[05:01:26.950 --> 05:01:29.030]  your breeding standards, you know?
[05:01:29.030 --> 05:01:32.350]  And you're kind of like with the cannabis side of things,
[05:01:32.350 --> 05:01:35.190]  I think you're isolated by the box that you're in, right?
[05:01:35.190 --> 05:01:38.110]  So it's like, you know, I mean, you know,
[05:01:38.110 --> 05:01:39.470]  whether you're breeding for a customer
[05:01:39.470 --> 05:01:41.230]  or you're breeding for yourself, you know, I mean,
[05:01:41.230 --> 05:01:43.470]  like the majority of people have a certain idea
[05:01:43.470 --> 05:01:45.390]  of what they want or what sells, you know,
[05:01:45.390 --> 05:01:48.070]  like as far as like flower structure profile,
[05:01:48.070 --> 05:01:49.830]  if they had, you know, color to it, right?
[05:01:49.830 --> 05:01:51.430]  Everything wants, everyone wants a little bit of color
[05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:53.950]  nowadays, so, whereas hemp, you know,
[05:01:53.950 --> 05:01:55.990]  you kind of have these boundaries, right?
[05:01:55.990 --> 05:01:59.390]  I mean, no Delta nine, but everything else, you know,
[05:01:59.390 --> 05:02:01.430]  so you have all the other colors, et cetera,
[05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:03.510]  you know, that one, whereas the, you know,
[05:02:03.510 --> 05:02:05.750]  and kind of with the THC side, it's like, you know,
[05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:07.590]  if you don't have THC, nobody's going to want it.
[05:02:07.590 --> 05:02:10.590]  So I don't know, but I think the future
[05:02:10.590 --> 05:02:13.350]  is the combination of them all, you know?
[05:02:13.350 --> 05:02:14.870]  I mean, that's inevitable, right?
[05:02:14.870 --> 05:02:17.270]  So it's like, you know, I mean, we grew out some plants
[05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:20.110]  and we were finding like two to one CBG THC.
[05:02:20.110 --> 05:02:23.910]  So, you know, you have the 10% CBG plant with 5% THC.
[05:02:24.750 --> 05:02:25.870]  I mean, those are enjoyable smokes, you know?
[05:02:25.870 --> 05:02:29.190]  And I mean, there's somebody out there, you know,
[05:02:29.190 --> 05:02:31.590]  that I think for everything, right?
[05:02:31.590 --> 05:02:33.870]  There's, so I don't know, not now,
[05:02:33.870 --> 05:02:35.230]  now not only will you have, you know,
[05:02:35.230 --> 05:02:37.310]  flavors to choose from and potency,
[05:02:37.310 --> 05:02:41.030]  but now you'll have an entourage of different cannabinoids
[05:02:41.030 --> 05:02:42.230]  to kind of, you know.
[05:02:42.230 --> 05:02:43.670]  And that's what I feel like the,
[05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:45.990]  I don't want to piss people off.
[05:02:45.990 --> 05:02:47.830]  I feel like the true grower, the true breeder,
[05:02:47.830 --> 05:02:49.390]  that's kind of what we want, right?
[05:02:49.390 --> 05:02:52.270]  We want that full, I think paint brush, full.
[05:02:52.270 --> 05:02:53.150]  Yeah, the full palette.
[05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:56.710]  I think there's a place for everybody, right?
[05:02:56.710 --> 05:02:59.950]  I mean, if you just, you know, I mean,
[05:02:59.950 --> 05:03:01.270]  every breeder has their style
[05:03:01.270 --> 05:03:02.550]  and kind of what they're interested in.
[05:03:02.550 --> 05:03:04.750]  But I mean, yeah, I mean, at the end of the day,
[05:03:04.750 --> 05:03:07.510]  I mean, it's like we have, I don't know, man,
[05:03:07.510 --> 05:03:08.990]  I feel like this cannabis plant,
[05:03:08.990 --> 05:03:11.150]  it feels like it's like alien technology.
[05:03:11.150 --> 05:03:13.070]  If you really want to get into it, right?
[05:03:13.070 --> 05:03:16.670]  I mean, it's like, how does one plant do everything, right?
[05:03:16.670 --> 05:03:18.950]  It's not only medicine, but, you know, I mean,
[05:03:18.950 --> 05:03:20.990]  you could literally build everything out of it.
[05:03:20.990 --> 05:03:22.150]  You know, I mean, it's just.
[05:03:22.150 --> 05:03:23.670]  You're talking to a guy, Dave Bruce,
[05:03:23.670 --> 05:03:26.910]  that was retrofitting a Mazda Miata with hemp.
[05:03:26.910 --> 05:03:28.030]  Yeah, dude, and I'm, you know,
[05:03:28.030 --> 05:03:29.470]  I have a background in construction.
[05:03:29.470 --> 05:03:32.150]  I have a master's in environmental studies,
[05:03:32.150 --> 05:03:33.790]  so I studied green building.
[05:03:33.790 --> 05:03:36.510]  And I mean, yeah, that is everything.
[05:03:36.510 --> 05:03:38.670]  Awesome, but I mean, like hemp insulation,
[05:03:38.670 --> 05:03:40.190]  hemp hardwood floor.
[05:03:40.190 --> 05:03:41.390]  I mean, you're talking about hemp, you know,
[05:03:41.390 --> 05:03:43.430]  hemp tree, hemp press boards.
[05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:45.430]  You could actually build things out of hemp,
[05:03:45.430 --> 05:03:46.430]  you know, hemp wood.
[05:03:47.910 --> 05:03:50.470]  You know, I think the building sector,
[05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:52.270]  and then obviously the food industries,
[05:03:52.270 --> 05:03:54.710]  you're gonna see, you know, apart from the, you know,
[05:03:54.710 --> 05:03:57.230]  kind of the resin and the, you know,
[05:03:57.230 --> 05:03:59.110]  the smoke of a flower market of hemp.
[05:03:59.110 --> 05:04:00.990]  Cause I feel like eventually,
[05:04:00.990 --> 05:04:02.430]  this is where I don't know if we're getting off track
[05:04:02.430 --> 05:04:04.030]  or not, but that's gonna be a small market.
[05:04:04.030 --> 05:04:06.670]  You know, I think the future is gonna be, you know,
[05:04:06.670 --> 05:04:09.390]  hemp plastics, you know, hemp building materials.
[05:04:09.390 --> 05:04:11.830]  I mean, hemp is one of the most nutritious
[05:04:11.830 --> 05:04:13.030]  food sources, right?
[05:04:15.350 --> 05:04:16.190]  It's tiny, right?
[05:04:16.190 --> 05:04:17.590]  It's a small market.
[05:04:17.590 --> 05:04:18.430]  Yep.
[05:04:18.430 --> 05:04:19.270]  Everything out of the floor.
[05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:20.750]  And out of all that.
[05:04:20.750 --> 05:04:21.870]  It's like this expo is proof of that.
[05:04:21.870 --> 05:04:22.710]  Yeah.
[05:04:22.710 --> 05:04:24.830]  Oh dude, I've been talking to people that like,
[05:04:24.830 --> 05:04:26.710]  well, I think this is the seventh one,
[05:04:26.710 --> 05:04:28.630]  that they came when it was the first one
[05:04:28.630 --> 05:04:29.630]  and it was all farmers.
[05:04:29.630 --> 05:04:30.870]  It was all like grassroots.
[05:04:30.870 --> 05:04:31.710]  And she's like.
[05:04:31.710 --> 05:04:32.550]  It was like at a coffee shop.
[05:04:32.550 --> 05:04:34.110]  Yeah, it was at like some little place.
[05:04:34.110 --> 05:04:36.350]  And she's like, man, and look at how far we've come.
[05:04:36.350 --> 05:04:37.190]  And she's like, and you know,
[05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:39.310]  what's missing is all the farmers and you know,
[05:04:39.310 --> 05:04:41.150]  all the seed, all the breeders, you know,
[05:04:41.150 --> 05:04:44.070]  cause it used to be kind of a little more grassroots.
[05:04:44.070 --> 05:04:46.190]  And now, now it's getting commercialized too.
[05:04:46.190 --> 05:04:48.710]  But you know, you look at cannabis culture
[05:04:49.150 --> 05:04:50.630]  and I feel like even, you know,
[05:04:50.630 --> 05:04:53.430]  a part of the, like that transfers over,
[05:04:53.430 --> 05:04:56.670]  like the people that enjoy like premium smokable hemp flour,
[05:04:56.670 --> 05:04:58.670]  the same people that enjoy cannabis, you know,
[05:04:58.670 --> 05:04:59.870]  it's the same flavors.
[05:04:59.870 --> 05:05:01.670]  It's, well, I mean, we're getting there, you know,
[05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:03.550]  I mean, there's still a lot of work to be done
[05:05:03.550 --> 05:05:05.350]  as far as the flavors on the hemp side.
[05:05:05.350 --> 05:05:09.430]  But, but yeah, I mean, it's, the future is bright.
[05:05:09.430 --> 05:05:12.910]  I mean, there's what, 108 different known cannabinoids.
[05:05:12.910 --> 05:05:15.390]  And I mean, it's like, we have a whole, you know,
[05:05:15.390 --> 05:05:16.750]  pharmacy to crack open.
[05:05:16.790 --> 05:05:18.830]  It's like, you know, so.
[05:05:18.830 --> 05:05:19.710]  Wizard's book.
[05:05:19.710 --> 05:05:20.830]  Yeah, wizard's book, man.
[05:05:20.830 --> 05:05:23.310]  And I mean, not only that, but I said graphene,
[05:05:23.310 --> 05:05:26.470]  like they're talking about graphene replacing silica
[05:05:26.470 --> 05:05:28.790]  in electronics in the future.
[05:05:28.790 --> 05:05:30.910]  And the best graphene comes from hemp.
[05:05:30.910 --> 05:05:33.790]  So I mean, it's about time.
[05:05:33.790 --> 05:05:35.230]  There's one thing that can, you know,
[05:05:35.230 --> 05:05:37.670]  dig us out of this hole we've dug, it's hemp.
[05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:38.510]  It's this plant.
[05:05:38.510 --> 05:05:41.110]  So I mean, I'm excited, man.
[05:05:41.110 --> 05:05:42.190]  And both sides, like I said,
[05:05:42.190 --> 05:05:43.990]  cannabis, there's no, it's all the cannabis.
[05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.910]  It's all cannabis.
[05:05:44.910 --> 05:05:45.830]  It's all one plant.
[05:05:47.150 --> 05:05:49.630]  Now, the beauty of today is that every single person
[05:05:49.630 --> 05:05:51.470]  that we've talked to has been passionate
[05:05:51.470 --> 05:05:53.190]  about whatever they do.
[05:05:53.190 --> 05:05:54.750]  That's something that I feel like we hope
[05:05:54.750 --> 05:05:57.070]  that you guys see as well as hemp is something
[05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:58.790]  that is definitely here to stay.
[05:05:59.910 --> 05:06:01.830]  We're probably gonna have some rapid fire questions
[05:06:01.830 --> 05:06:03.070]  here for you, Floyd.
[05:06:04.070 --> 05:06:04.910]  Yeah, THC.
[05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:06.470]  You see that from Grayson, yeah?
[05:06:06.470 --> 05:06:08.470]  Yeah, yeah, THC, B-Col-3.
[05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:10.110]  Yeah, so I've got, Suncross,
[05:06:10.110 --> 05:06:13.430]  and I've got a THC-B by CBD that's going out.
[05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:15.070]  Those will be done shortly.
[05:06:15.110 --> 05:06:16.990]  But I think the ones,
[05:06:16.990 --> 05:06:20.390]  and then I have some CBDV stuff coming down.
[05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:22.150]  But the ones I'm most excited about
[05:06:22.150 --> 05:06:24.790]  are those land-raised seeds we just popped.
[05:06:24.790 --> 05:06:27.470]  So I should know, I'm gonna have some early leaf testing
[05:06:27.470 --> 05:06:29.070]  done in maybe a couple of weeks.
[05:06:30.470 --> 05:06:31.790]  So yeah, if you check the Instagram,
[05:06:31.790 --> 05:06:33.190]  I'll probably post those up.
[05:06:34.990 --> 05:06:37.630]  There's another question I thought Peter flashed up.
[05:06:40.590 --> 05:06:41.750]  Let me go back to it.
[05:06:41.790 --> 05:06:44.910]  It was your Barren's G.
[05:06:46.150 --> 05:06:49.470]  Oh, yeah, yeah, the Mad Villain, yep.
[05:06:50.390 --> 05:06:53.750]  Male-female selections for your Barren's G.
[05:06:53.750 --> 05:06:58.750]  So that's actually a Femt-Cross.
[05:06:58.830 --> 05:07:02.350]  So that was, the pollen donor was our Mad Dog CBD.
[05:07:02.350 --> 05:07:04.390]  And that basically came to us
[05:07:04.390 --> 05:07:08.110]  as like a CBD bag variety from Switzerland.
[05:07:08.110 --> 05:07:10.310]  So we grew those out and made selections.
[05:07:10.310 --> 05:07:14.150]  We also have the R1s of those available,
[05:07:14.150 --> 05:07:18.110]  and that's a pure type four CBG hemotype.
[05:07:18.110 --> 05:07:23.110]  And the mother that we pollinated
[05:07:24.750 --> 05:07:28.070]  was the one-to-one THCB cut.
[05:07:29.030 --> 05:07:32.670]  So that's like an African land-raised long flowering plant.
[05:07:32.670 --> 05:07:34.990]  So yeah, I mean, they tend,
[05:07:34.990 --> 05:07:36.910]  it still has that sativa structure
[05:07:36.910 --> 05:07:38.910]  because the pollen donor that we used,
[05:07:38.910 --> 05:07:40.550]  it was more of a sativa hybrid,
[05:07:42.070 --> 05:07:44.630]  but we're hoping that it just lower the flowering times
[05:07:44.630 --> 05:07:45.990]  because the pollen donor
[05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:48.670]  was around eight, nine week finishers.
[05:07:54.550 --> 05:07:57.430]  So we may have a surprise guest,
[05:07:57.430 --> 05:08:02.430]  but I think he's driving and has to pull over to jump on.
[05:08:03.030 --> 05:08:03.870]  Cool.
[05:08:03.870 --> 05:08:04.830]  So I was stalling for time,
[05:08:04.830 --> 05:08:08.110]  but who's the baby that you just carried over?
[05:08:09.390 --> 05:08:10.550]  Oh, this thing.
[05:08:10.550 --> 05:08:11.990]  Okay, so yin-yang.
[05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:14.310]  I've got yin-yang seeds.
[05:08:14.310 --> 05:08:17.790]  So we also, so we have a seed bank online,
[05:08:17.790 --> 05:08:19.470]  at hokuseedco.com.
[05:08:19.470 --> 05:08:20.470]  And we're just, you know,
[05:08:20.470 --> 05:08:22.070]  it's kind of like a small collective of breeders
[05:08:22.070 --> 05:08:23.750]  that are just interested in all the different
[05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:26.590]  kind of cannabinoids, mixed ratios.
[05:08:27.670 --> 05:08:31.790]  This is a type three, I forget which one he brought.
[05:08:31.790 --> 05:08:33.510]  It might be an abacus cross,
[05:08:33.510 --> 05:08:37.310]  but what caught my attention was he does a lot of type twos.
[05:08:37.310 --> 05:08:38.710]  So he's crossing, you know,
[05:08:38.710 --> 05:08:43.470]  he's taking some of the best kind of hemp varieties
[05:08:43.470 --> 05:08:45.950]  out there and hitting them to some of his, you know,
[05:08:45.950 --> 05:08:48.750]  keeper moms and come up with some really cool stuff.
[05:08:49.910 --> 05:08:52.150]  So that's, yeah, so that's what we got there.
[05:08:57.120 --> 05:08:58.600]  What's some of the stuff that you noticed
[05:08:58.600 --> 05:09:00.880]  that people are coming through asking you
[05:09:00.880 --> 05:09:03.240]  before they're buying your seeds?
[05:09:03.240 --> 05:09:04.800]  Today, I mean, honestly, man,
[05:09:04.800 --> 05:09:07.800]  we've got, we've sold more hoodies than we have seed.
[05:09:07.800 --> 05:09:10.400]  I don't think nobody knew we were up on the third floor.
[05:09:12.440 --> 05:09:13.280]  And I've sold more-
[05:09:13.280 --> 05:09:14.720]  At least you're not in the basement.
[05:09:14.720 --> 05:09:15.560]  It could be worse.
[05:09:15.560 --> 05:09:16.400]  Yeah.
[05:09:17.560 --> 05:09:19.480]  Yeah, that's where they put us, down here.
[05:09:19.480 --> 05:09:21.440]  I know, dude, come up, we've got plenty of space.
[05:09:21.440 --> 05:09:24.760]  You guys should move up, move up right where we're at.
[05:09:24.760 --> 05:09:26.320]  They might let us move on the third floor.
[05:09:26.320 --> 05:09:28.080]  Dude, yeah, you guys should come up, man.
[05:09:28.080 --> 05:09:29.960]  I mean, yeah, it might be a little noisy,
[05:09:29.960 --> 05:09:30.800]  but I don't know.
[05:09:30.800 --> 05:09:31.640]  That's a lot warmer.
[05:09:31.640 --> 05:09:32.720]  Oh, it's definitely warmer.
[05:09:32.720 --> 05:09:33.640]  Yeah.
[05:09:33.640 --> 05:09:34.480]  Yeah.
[05:09:36.480 --> 05:09:37.680]  What was the question?
[05:09:37.680 --> 05:09:39.040]  What are people asking for?
[05:09:39.240 --> 05:09:43.240]  I've gotten more people interested in the mixed ratios
[05:09:43.240 --> 05:09:47.600]  and the THC stuff than just the hemp stuff alone.
[05:09:47.600 --> 05:09:51.040]  And I don't know, I mean,
[05:09:51.040 --> 05:09:53.320]  we haven't gotten a lot of hemp farmers up there, maybe,
[05:09:53.320 --> 05:09:54.840]  that are interested, or people,
[05:09:54.840 --> 05:09:56.240]  I've got a couple of people that bought some
[05:09:56.240 --> 05:09:58.720]  just for their home grows, like their hobby grows,
[05:09:58.720 --> 05:09:59.760]  which is kind of cool too,
[05:09:59.760 --> 05:10:01.640]  because that's what I'm all about.
[05:10:01.640 --> 05:10:04.520]  I mean, everybody should have a cannabis plant
[05:10:04.520 --> 05:10:05.640]  in their home garden.
[05:10:05.640 --> 05:10:08.320]  So even if it's just ornamental,
[05:10:09.320 --> 05:10:12.120]  I gave my wife's grandfather an auto flower last year,
[05:10:12.120 --> 05:10:13.600]  and he just planted it in his backyard,
[05:10:13.600 --> 05:10:15.560]  and it was like, stunk up his yard.
[05:10:15.560 --> 05:10:17.600]  The neighbors would come over,
[05:10:17.600 --> 05:10:18.640]  and he'd show it off to them.
[05:10:18.640 --> 05:10:23.640]  So yeah, hopefully that's the future.
[05:10:28.280 --> 05:10:30.360]  Yeah, is he coming on, or should?
[05:10:30.360 --> 05:10:32.440]  Sorry, I was laughing at,
[05:10:35.480 --> 05:10:37.440]  I'm trying to think of how to even say this.
[05:10:37.440 --> 05:10:41.000]  So this morning we were broadcasting Christian,
[05:10:43.240 --> 05:10:47.400]  this guy who's in jail in El Dorado County's court hearing
[05:10:47.400 --> 05:10:50.760]  from like the El Dorado Superior Court,
[05:10:50.760 --> 05:10:55.760]  and oh my God, look who's there.
[05:10:58.400 --> 05:10:59.240]  Boom.
[05:11:00.080 --> 05:11:01.800]  Hopefully I didn't put you on the spot, man.
[05:11:01.800 --> 05:11:02.640]  What up?
[05:11:02.640 --> 05:11:04.320]  You're not one of the Ding brothers.
[05:11:04.320 --> 05:11:06.920]  It wasn't, not much was going on there anyway.
[05:11:08.240 --> 05:11:09.400]  Right on.
[05:11:09.400 --> 05:11:10.680]  So it's good coverage.
[05:11:10.680 --> 05:11:11.600]  Yeah.
[05:11:11.600 --> 05:11:12.720]  Man, I had to run home.
[05:11:12.720 --> 05:11:15.200]  I've had a crazy day, so I'll just put it at that,
[05:11:15.200 --> 05:11:17.000]  but I've been running around like a madman.
[05:11:17.000 --> 05:11:19.080]  So I just managed to get back home.
[05:11:19.080 --> 05:11:20.960]  I got like five minutes I can chat with you guys,
[05:11:20.960 --> 05:11:22.400]  and then I'm back on the road.
[05:11:23.480 --> 05:11:25.120]  Well, just quickly, Rob,
[05:11:25.120 --> 05:11:29.400]  what, talk about these guys as breeders
[05:11:29.400 --> 05:11:31.360]  and what you respect about them,
[05:11:31.360 --> 05:11:34.800]  and kind of from the outside looking in,
[05:11:34.800 --> 05:11:37.080]  what kind of how you evaluate them.
[05:11:37.720 --> 05:11:42.200]  So Floyd and me kind of linked up a while ago,
[05:11:42.200 --> 05:11:45.360]  and we had a formal introduction
[05:11:45.360 --> 05:11:48.800]  to where he wanted to purchase some seed stock,
[05:11:48.800 --> 05:11:51.520]  and we hit it off like immediately.
[05:11:51.520 --> 05:11:53.760]  He just had the same ideals.
[05:11:54.760 --> 05:11:55.640]  I mean, it was like,
[05:11:55.640 --> 05:11:57.080]  we were supposed to meet for like 10 minutes,
[05:11:57.080 --> 05:11:59.440]  and I think both of our wives like texted
[05:11:59.440 --> 05:12:01.000]  to make sure we were alive still,
[05:12:01.000 --> 05:12:02.200]  because it was our first meeting.
[05:12:02.200 --> 05:12:04.760]  And so they're like, did the guy kill you or something?
[05:12:04.800 --> 05:12:08.800]  And then, yeah, we just became like instant friends,
[05:12:08.800 --> 05:12:09.640]  pretty much.
[05:12:09.640 --> 05:12:11.000]  It's like that scene in Step Brothers
[05:12:11.000 --> 05:12:12.520]  where you become best friends
[05:12:12.520 --> 05:12:15.320]  and just high five each other and kind of go from there.
[05:12:16.320 --> 05:12:17.160]  Went to his bar.
[05:12:18.440 --> 05:12:20.280]  Got a check out at his farm.
[05:12:22.000 --> 05:12:23.360]  His farm was real dope,
[05:12:23.360 --> 05:12:26.360]  and just his ideals and kind of how we went through
[05:12:26.360 --> 05:12:29.160]  his process was very, very similar
[05:12:29.160 --> 05:12:30.960]  to kind of how I do things,
[05:12:30.960 --> 05:12:33.640]  and different, but the same.
[05:12:33.640 --> 05:12:35.440]  And that's what I really look for,
[05:12:35.440 --> 05:12:37.960]  just people who can kind of uplift each other
[05:12:37.960 --> 05:12:40.520]  and have the same ideals on moving
[05:12:40.520 --> 05:12:44.200]  the whole cannabinoid structure on,
[05:12:44.200 --> 05:12:48.240]  and just working plants, having large counts.
[05:12:48.240 --> 05:12:51.120]  He's into agricultural stuff as well, building.
[05:12:51.120 --> 05:12:52.560]  And I mean, just overall,
[05:12:52.560 --> 05:12:54.440]  I respect Floyd as a family man as well.
[05:12:54.440 --> 05:12:58.280]  He's just always there for his family,
[05:12:58.280 --> 05:13:00.200]  always on the farm giving 100%.
[05:13:00.200 --> 05:13:01.440]  I mean, it's just,
[05:13:01.440 --> 05:13:03.840]  everybody should look up to somebody like him
[05:13:03.840 --> 05:13:06.160]  because he is an example of what we want
[05:13:06.160 --> 05:13:07.960]  as people in the cannabis community.
[05:13:08.960 --> 05:13:10.240]  Man, appreciate it, man.
[05:13:11.560 --> 05:13:12.680]  Yeah, no, dude, we do.
[05:13:12.680 --> 05:13:16.760]  We're on the same level on many different things.
[05:13:16.760 --> 05:13:18.360]  But yeah, I mean, the love for the plant
[05:13:18.360 --> 05:13:19.360]  and love for our family.
[05:13:19.360 --> 05:13:21.880]  I mean, for me, it's all about,
[05:13:23.240 --> 05:13:24.840]  honestly, this is the longest time
[05:13:24.840 --> 05:13:27.160]  I'll be away from my plants in like five, six years,
[05:13:27.160 --> 05:13:28.000]  two nights.
[05:13:28.000 --> 05:13:29.960]  It's like, I live on my farm,
[05:13:29.960 --> 05:13:31.120]  and that's where my family is.
[05:13:31.880 --> 05:13:33.720]  And so, yeah, it's all about,
[05:13:33.720 --> 05:13:35.520]  that's kind of what I've built my life around
[05:13:35.520 --> 05:13:37.840]  is this plant and my family.
[05:13:37.840 --> 05:13:40.400]  And then Rob gets to come in,
[05:13:40.400 --> 05:13:42.680]  and he makes himself right at home and his boy.
[05:13:42.680 --> 05:13:44.360]  And yeah, we just kick it, man.
[05:13:44.360 --> 05:13:45.800]  Worse on my side.
[05:13:45.800 --> 05:13:47.600]  Yeah, hey, well, we, you know,
[05:13:47.600 --> 05:13:49.920]  the farmer said we can just let the kids run wild, kinda.
[05:13:49.920 --> 05:13:52.760]  I mean, it's like, don't get-
[05:13:52.760 --> 05:13:54.640]  That's the American dream, man, in my opinion.
[05:13:54.640 --> 05:13:55.840]  Yeah, yeah, right.
[05:13:55.840 --> 05:13:58.800]  You never let your kids run without worry?
[05:13:58.800 --> 05:14:00.400]  You know, it's fenced in around,
[05:14:00.720 --> 05:14:02.440]  and I mean, we know all our neighbors.
[05:14:02.440 --> 05:14:05.280]  I mean, you do worry a little bit,
[05:14:05.280 --> 05:14:06.760]  you know, especially about the smart ones.
[05:14:06.760 --> 05:14:09.160]  Rob's boy, he knows how to take shit apart.
[05:14:09.160 --> 05:14:11.240]  I mean, you gotta, he'll find some tools
[05:14:11.240 --> 05:14:12.760]  and dismantle your house, man.
[05:14:14.080 --> 05:14:16.520]  Yeah, I told him never give him a screwdriver ever
[05:14:16.520 --> 05:14:19.400]  because literally he'll take apart like ballast
[05:14:19.400 --> 05:14:20.640]  and like all kinds of stuff.
[05:14:20.640 --> 05:14:24.160]  So he'll come back, his whole hoop house will be like,
[05:14:24.160 --> 05:14:25.760]  I mean, he'll reprogram everything
[05:14:25.760 --> 05:14:28.160]  in like a two minute span or something.
[05:14:28.160 --> 05:14:30.080]  So we have to keep eyes on him around those.
[05:14:30.880 --> 05:14:33.800]  But how old is he other than that?
[05:14:33.800 --> 05:14:34.640]  Eight.
[05:14:34.640 --> 05:14:36.560]  Eight, how old are you, children?
[05:14:36.560 --> 05:14:39.200]  I have two, four, and six, stacked.
[05:14:39.200 --> 05:14:40.280]  Yep, I'm done.
[05:14:41.240 --> 05:14:42.080]  Yep, yep.
[05:14:44.600 --> 05:14:46.680]  Yeah, no, we got all that out of the way.
[05:14:46.680 --> 05:14:48.320]  So yeah, no, they're all,
[05:14:48.320 --> 05:14:50.400]  and they've grown up around the plant too,
[05:14:50.400 --> 05:14:52.880]  and that's part of the thing that I enjoy too,
[05:14:52.880 --> 05:14:55.080]  is I mean, whether they enjoy it or not,
[05:14:55.080 --> 05:14:57.160]  you know, they're gonna learn how to grow,
[05:14:57.160 --> 05:14:58.160]  grow what, you know?
[05:14:59.160 --> 05:15:01.120]  Just grow, grow something, you know?
[05:15:01.120 --> 05:15:02.920]  If they can grow cannabis, they can grow, you know,
[05:15:02.920 --> 05:15:05.160]  food to eat, you know, plants they enjoy.
[05:15:05.160 --> 05:15:08.000]  So it's a good skill to learn how to do.
[05:15:08.000 --> 05:15:10.760]  100%, that was really the skill set to have.
[05:15:10.760 --> 05:15:13.640]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, you can feed yourself, you know,
[05:15:13.640 --> 05:15:14.640]  grow your own medicine.
[05:15:14.640 --> 05:15:16.440]  I mean, it's, yeah, it's one of those things that,
[05:15:16.440 --> 05:15:18.400]  you know, people, people kind of forgot.
[05:15:18.400 --> 05:15:19.640]  I mean, I think, I think all,
[05:15:19.640 --> 05:15:21.320]  I bet if you go ask all your grandparents,
[05:15:21.320 --> 05:15:23.120]  they all had home gardens, you know?
[05:15:24.600 --> 05:15:25.960]  I remember that, like my grandfather,
[05:15:25.960 --> 05:15:28.040]  I remember him just being a strong individual.
[05:15:28.960 --> 05:15:29.800]  He was always drinking without working out.
[05:15:29.800 --> 05:15:31.200]  Dude, and that's part of it too, you know?
[05:15:31.200 --> 05:15:33.160]  You do a hard labor job,
[05:15:33.160 --> 05:15:34.960]  you feel good at the end of the day, you know?
[05:15:34.960 --> 05:15:36.280]  Whether you had a good or bad day,
[05:15:36.280 --> 05:15:38.240]  your body's tired, your mind's tired.
[05:15:39.160 --> 05:15:40.240]  Yeah, absolutely.
[05:15:40.240 --> 05:15:41.240]  Absolutely.
[05:15:41.240 --> 05:15:42.560]  Yeah.
[05:15:42.560 --> 05:15:44.280]  All right, fellas, well, I gotta hop off here, man.
[05:15:44.280 --> 05:15:46.480]  I gotta get back to it, but it's nice seeing you, man.
[05:15:46.480 --> 05:15:47.840]  Kill it at NOCO, please.
[05:15:47.840 --> 05:15:49.320]  Yeah, let's do it.
[05:15:49.320 --> 05:15:50.600]  Everybody, we're on the third floor.
[05:15:50.600 --> 05:15:51.480]  Tell all your friends.
[05:15:51.480 --> 05:15:52.320]  Absolutely.
[05:15:52.320 --> 05:15:53.160]  Thanks for joining us.
[05:15:53.160 --> 05:15:56.200]  And check them out on IG, Hoku Seed Co.
[05:15:56.240 --> 05:15:58.160]  We definitely have some fire coming for you guys.
[05:15:58.160 --> 05:16:00.080]  We've been collaborating on a lot of stuff,
[05:16:00.080 --> 05:16:02.160]  so be on the lookout for that.
[05:16:03.320 --> 05:16:04.240]  Appreciate your time.
[05:16:04.240 --> 05:16:05.720]  Take it easy.
[05:16:05.720 --> 05:16:07.320]  Have a good day, man, take care.
[05:16:10.280 --> 05:16:12.360]  That was our surprise guest.
[05:16:12.360 --> 05:16:14.080]  All right, well, thank you.
[05:16:14.080 --> 05:16:16.000]  Yeah, we appreciate your time.
[05:16:16.000 --> 05:16:17.240]  Yeah, dude, this was awesome, man.
[05:16:17.240 --> 05:16:18.720]  I'm glad, it was nice to meet you guys.
[05:16:18.720 --> 05:16:20.200]  And yeah, maybe we can do it again.
[05:16:20.200 --> 05:16:21.680]  Are you guys local to Denver?
[05:16:21.680 --> 05:16:22.520]  Yeah, absolutely.
[05:16:22.520 --> 05:16:24.880]  I swear I popped in, I think Rob sent me a link
[05:16:24.880 --> 05:16:27.480]  to you guys' show and I popped in.
[05:16:27.480 --> 05:16:28.520]  So this is Peter's show.
[05:16:28.520 --> 05:16:32.280]  We just, yeah, we have like our own little thing.
[05:16:32.280 --> 05:16:34.840]  Okay, man, okay, because you guys look familiar,
[05:16:34.840 --> 05:16:35.680]  so maybe it was that.
[05:16:35.680 --> 05:16:37.480]  I used to get people high all the time.
[05:16:37.480 --> 05:16:38.320]  Okay, so.
[05:16:38.320 --> 05:16:40.520]  Usually these have the fabrics and stuff.
[05:16:40.520 --> 05:16:41.360]  Okay.
[05:16:41.360 --> 05:16:42.200]  You might've been to one of his events.
[05:16:42.200 --> 05:16:43.880]  You were perky in my knee.
[05:16:43.880 --> 05:16:44.960]  Yeah, that's what it is.
[05:16:44.960 --> 05:16:45.800]  Yeah, you guys have recognized me.
[05:16:45.800 --> 05:16:50.800]  Yeah, are you guys allowed to smoke hemp in the basement?
[05:16:51.840 --> 05:16:52.680]  Dude, I don't know, I brought a-
[05:16:52.680 --> 05:16:54.680]  No smoking anything.
[05:16:54.680 --> 05:16:56.720]  Man, you guys could probably get away with it down here.
[05:16:56.720 --> 05:16:58.840]  I bought a bunch of RSO and I've been handing that out.
[05:16:58.840 --> 05:17:01.520]  So everybody, yeah, we're still-
[05:17:01.520 --> 05:17:03.560]  We got a little sneaky sneak down here,
[05:17:04.440 --> 05:17:06.280]  but we didn't have CBD.
[05:17:06.280 --> 05:17:07.360]  Oh yeah.
[05:17:07.360 --> 05:17:08.200]  Yeah, I should probably-
[05:17:08.200 --> 05:17:09.480]  I think midday tomorrow,
[05:17:09.480 --> 05:17:11.680]  you guys should just pull the dab rigs out
[05:17:11.680 --> 05:17:14.360]  until you get thrown out and we'll call it a day.
[05:17:14.360 --> 05:17:16.320]  Yeah, I don't think, dude,
[05:17:16.320 --> 05:17:18.680]  I don't think anybody would say anything to you down here.
[05:17:18.680 --> 05:17:19.680]  Probably not.
[05:17:19.680 --> 05:17:21.000]  I don't even think they know we're down here.
[05:17:21.000 --> 05:17:22.480]  CBD, that's dabable.
[05:17:22.480 --> 05:17:23.320]  Yeah.
[05:17:23.320 --> 05:17:24.240]  CBD's dabable.
[05:17:24.240 --> 05:17:25.160]  I mean, I have no,
[05:17:25.160 --> 05:17:26.960]  it's CBD if you want to put it as your bars,
[05:17:26.960 --> 05:17:28.800]  but you can put it up here to smoke it.
[05:17:28.800 --> 05:17:29.640]  Yeah.
[05:17:29.640 --> 05:17:31.440]  They can't get mad at that.
[05:17:31.440 --> 05:17:32.520]  It's CBD, man.
[05:17:32.520 --> 05:17:34.120]  People are vaping CBD.
[05:17:34.120 --> 05:17:35.800]  People are vaping.
[05:17:35.800 --> 05:17:36.840]  We're in the dungeon.
[05:17:39.320 --> 05:17:42.760]  You're the only people in a 10,000 square foot space.
[05:17:42.760 --> 05:17:44.960]  No, there's another media company over here
[05:17:44.960 --> 05:17:47.160]  doing some podcasting, but-
[05:17:47.160 --> 05:17:48.720]  Invite them over.
[05:17:48.720 --> 05:17:50.960]  I think they're in the middle of their podcast now.
[05:17:50.960 --> 05:17:52.000]  Very serious.
[05:17:52.160 --> 05:17:54.160]  The business of marijuana.
[05:17:57.160 --> 05:17:58.800]  They ain't got no dab bar, though.
[05:18:00.320 --> 05:18:01.160]  Yeah, dude, they should have let you guys-
[05:18:01.160 --> 05:18:03.000]  It's on this black table.
[05:18:03.000 --> 05:18:04.720]  They should have let you guys have a dab bar now,
[05:18:04.720 --> 05:18:06.880]  you know, like a hemp dab bar?
[05:18:06.880 --> 05:18:09.440]  I don't think they knew really what we-
[05:18:09.440 --> 05:18:11.640]  Aloha to the Hawaiian crew.
[05:18:13.040 --> 05:18:15.200]  Are you guys, you'll be down here tomorrow?
[05:18:15.200 --> 05:18:16.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[05:18:16.040 --> 05:18:17.960]  Come on down, or if they'll let us come up there,
[05:18:17.960 --> 05:18:19.360]  we'd love to be up there, because-
[05:18:19.360 --> 05:18:20.200]  Dude, you should be up there.
[05:18:20.200 --> 05:18:22.120]  Third level is cooler than this one.
[05:18:22.120 --> 05:18:23.960]  Yeah, not many.
[05:18:23.960 --> 05:18:26.560]  Have you guys been live all day, or what?
[05:18:26.560 --> 05:18:28.200]  Yeah, five hours.
[05:18:28.200 --> 05:18:31.480]  We've been going for five hours and 18 minutes.
[05:18:31.480 --> 05:18:33.840]  So have you ever seen anything like this?
[05:18:33.840 --> 05:18:35.520]  Not that CBD.
[05:18:38.960 --> 05:18:40.680]  There's one company I wanted to ask up there.
[05:18:40.680 --> 05:18:42.640]  They say they can make anything.
[05:18:42.640 --> 05:18:44.680]  But they're like a third party.
[05:18:44.680 --> 05:18:46.000]  Prove it.
[05:18:46.000 --> 05:18:47.400]  All right, well, while you guys are dabbing,
[05:18:47.400 --> 05:18:49.200]  I'm gonna go ahead and get some more.
[05:18:49.240 --> 05:18:50.560]  All right, well, while you guys are dabbing,
[05:18:50.560 --> 05:18:52.880]  I'll get some music going, hold on.
[05:18:52.880 --> 05:18:53.720]  All right.
[05:18:53.720 --> 05:18:54.920]  Hey, when you act like it's-
[05:18:54.920 --> 05:18:56.600]  And they made that stuff?
[05:18:56.600 --> 05:18:59.800]  No, no, I just was wondering if they could make it.
[05:18:59.800 --> 05:19:01.440]  No, I know a company that makes it,
[05:19:01.440 --> 05:19:04.280]  but I can't find anybody else that can make it.
[05:19:04.280 --> 05:19:05.200]  It's CBD.
[05:19:05.200 --> 05:19:06.040]  Yep.
[05:19:06.960 --> 05:19:08.400]  Like you were saying, I haven't had a major-
[05:19:08.400 --> 05:19:09.400]  Is it Asheville Extract?
[05:19:09.400 --> 05:19:11.080]  Where'd you get that from?
[05:19:11.080 --> 05:19:13.640]  Got a little company that makes it.
[05:19:13.640 --> 05:19:14.600]  The only person that I would know
[05:19:14.600 --> 05:19:15.840]  that might be able to make something like that
[05:19:15.840 --> 05:19:17.640]  is maybe Asheville Extracts.
[05:19:17.640 --> 05:19:18.960]  They do a lot of hydrocarbon.
[05:19:19.720 --> 05:19:22.320]  I'm not super familiar with them, but they're, yeah.
[05:19:22.320 --> 05:19:26.120]  Yeah, it's, I found one company that made it.
[05:19:26.120 --> 05:19:28.800]  But it's the purest, pure crystalline I've found.
[05:19:30.080 --> 05:19:34.520]  That makes everyone's joints unswell.
[05:19:34.520 --> 05:19:35.360]  Yeah.
[05:19:36.920 --> 05:19:39.880]  No, and it's got a good smell to it.
[05:19:39.880 --> 05:19:40.720]  What?
[05:19:40.720 --> 05:19:41.560]  I don't think so.
[05:19:41.560 --> 05:19:42.400]  Not a...
[05:19:43.640 --> 05:19:44.480]  Wait, what?
[05:19:46.680 --> 05:19:47.520]  Yo, I haven't eaten,
[05:19:47.520 --> 05:19:49.440]  I haven't even had something to drink.
[05:19:49.440 --> 05:19:50.520]  Dude, you guys are crazy, man.
[05:19:50.520 --> 05:19:53.160]  I had to have my father-in-law sneak me out a sandwich
[05:19:53.160 --> 05:19:54.000]  because they want, you know,
[05:19:54.000 --> 05:19:55.400]  they basically want you to-
[05:19:55.400 --> 05:19:56.240]  Buy everything?
[05:19:56.240 --> 05:19:57.080]  In the restaurant.
[05:19:57.080 --> 05:19:58.360]  No, you can't take food out of the restaurant.
[05:19:58.360 --> 05:19:59.960]  Oh, they gave everyone lunches.
[05:20:01.000 --> 05:20:01.840]  Yeah.
[05:20:01.840 --> 05:20:02.680]  Did they?
[05:20:02.680 --> 05:20:03.720]  No, they gave you guys lunches.
[05:20:05.000 --> 05:20:07.320]  I didn't eat it, but that's all good.
[05:20:07.320 --> 05:20:08.760]  Hey, you want to try this?
[05:20:08.760 --> 05:20:09.720]  Yeah, I'll try it.
[05:20:11.560 --> 05:20:12.400]  That's hot.
[05:20:13.400 --> 05:20:16.000]  I feel like we should just put it like it's...
[05:20:16.000 --> 05:20:16.840]  That's not good.
[05:20:17.920 --> 05:20:19.000]  Yeah.
[05:20:19.000 --> 05:20:20.080]  Still alive, by the way.
[05:20:20.080 --> 05:20:20.920]  Oh, right on.
[05:20:20.920 --> 05:20:21.760]  Yeah.
[05:20:23.640 --> 05:20:24.800]  We're hitting some CBD, you guys.
[05:20:24.800 --> 05:20:25.800]  Oh, right on.
[05:20:25.800 --> 05:20:27.400]  Yeah, you guys want brown or...
[05:20:28.400 --> 05:20:29.440]  Green, please.
[05:20:29.440 --> 05:20:30.520]  I'm a hot guy.
[05:20:30.520 --> 05:20:34.040]  Yeah, we figured you'd probably want that one.
[05:20:34.040 --> 05:20:35.440]  Word, word.
[05:20:35.440 --> 05:20:36.920]  We got a card for you guys, here.
[05:20:36.920 --> 05:20:38.560]  Is your homie with us?
[05:20:38.560 --> 05:20:39.720]  Yeah, yeah, he was.
[05:20:39.720 --> 05:20:40.560]  Yeah.
[05:20:41.960 --> 05:20:43.040]  Getting the free swag.
[05:20:43.040 --> 05:20:44.320]  Okay.
[05:20:44.320 --> 05:20:45.160]  I got a card.
[05:20:45.160 --> 05:20:46.000]  We're gonna throw it out.
[05:20:46.000 --> 05:20:47.320]  Come talk to us, yeah.
[05:20:48.120 --> 05:20:49.280]  Are you guys going to that peer party after?
[05:20:49.280 --> 05:20:50.320]  Today?
[05:20:50.320 --> 05:20:51.160]  I don't know.
[05:20:51.160 --> 05:20:52.280]  Peer pressure.
[05:20:52.280 --> 05:20:53.120]  Okay.
[05:20:53.120 --> 05:20:55.000]  They're having like an after party thing.
[05:20:58.840 --> 05:21:00.000]  Right on, guys, thank you so much.
[05:21:00.000 --> 05:21:01.200]  Yeah, absolutely.
[05:21:01.200 --> 05:21:03.360]  Should we bring Dad by or what?
[05:21:03.360 --> 05:21:04.720]  I don't know, I was trying to find them too.
[05:21:04.720 --> 05:21:06.760]  We need to go find peer pressure.
[05:21:06.760 --> 05:21:08.440]  Are they on your floor?
[05:21:08.440 --> 05:21:10.080]  Do you guys know those dudes?
[05:21:10.080 --> 05:21:11.480]  I'm not sure, man.
[05:21:11.480 --> 05:21:12.440]  Where are you from?
[05:21:12.440 --> 05:21:13.280]  Washington State.
[05:21:13.280 --> 05:21:14.480]  By the way, can you guys hear the music?
[05:21:14.480 --> 05:21:16.040]  Seattle Pride, yeah.
[05:21:16.080 --> 05:21:17.480]  It's very nice, Peter.
[05:21:17.480 --> 05:21:18.920]  All right, appreciate it.
[05:21:18.920 --> 05:21:21.000]  Yeah, go back to your booth, bro, make some money.
[05:21:21.000 --> 05:21:21.840]  Yeah.
[05:21:21.840 --> 05:21:22.680]  All right, sir.
[05:21:22.680 --> 05:21:23.520]  Thanks for the...
[05:21:25.920 --> 05:21:27.640]  We'll look for you tomorrow, huh?
[05:21:29.040 --> 05:21:30.920]  I didn't want to act like it's,
[05:21:30.920 --> 05:21:32.560]  like we're doing something wrong.
[05:21:37.460 --> 05:21:39.980]  What you're doing is so right.
[05:21:39.980 --> 05:21:41.140]  It feels so right.
[05:21:53.510 --> 05:21:54.350]  Wasting it.
[05:21:56.030 --> 05:21:57.510]  Well, where's the cap, homie?
[05:22:04.100 --> 05:22:05.180]  Sound like that, Peter.
[05:22:05.180 --> 05:22:06.740]  What's that, jazz?
[05:22:08.420 --> 05:22:12.380]  This is a cover 50.
[05:22:13.740 --> 05:22:14.580]  Let me go see if I can get another one.
[05:22:14.580 --> 05:22:16.780]  He's doing this, a jazz cover.
[05:22:17.660 --> 05:22:19.260]  Hey, let me show this to you.
[05:22:20.100 --> 05:22:21.020]  Not my bad.
[05:22:28.360 --> 05:22:29.280]  Yeah, I like that.
[05:22:37.250 --> 05:22:40.050]  Hopefully this will not get the YouTube copyright ding.
[05:22:41.930 --> 05:22:43.610]  Totally suspect.
[05:22:43.610 --> 05:22:45.570]  Dude, that fool is nothing but suspect.
[05:22:50.540 --> 05:22:53.660]  It's a jazzy reggae tune.
[05:22:56.260 --> 05:22:57.460]  Do you ever listen to...
[05:23:02.140 --> 05:23:04.500]  Natalie Rize?
[05:23:04.500 --> 05:23:05.660]  You ever listen to her?
[05:23:05.660 --> 05:23:06.980]  Natalie Rize, huh?
[05:23:06.980 --> 05:23:08.180]  Mm-hmm.
[05:23:08.180 --> 05:23:09.460]  You should Google her real quick.
[05:23:09.460 --> 05:23:10.940]  She's a badass.
[05:23:15.070 --> 05:23:20.070]  I reached out to this guy, Quentin Furon,
[05:23:20.550 --> 05:23:24.230]  to see if he would want to come on
[05:23:24.230 --> 05:23:26.030]  and play some music one night.
[05:23:28.870 --> 05:23:31.630]  And then one of my friends,
[05:23:31.630 --> 05:23:33.950]  he's the chairman of Gibson Guitars,
[05:23:33.950 --> 05:23:38.950]  so I want to convince him to sponsor
[05:23:40.070 --> 05:23:45.070]  a Gibson FCP weekly music show.
[05:23:46.870 --> 05:23:48.990]  You should tell him to sponsor a guitar.
[05:23:51.790 --> 05:23:53.310]  Do Acid on Jazz?
[05:23:53.310 --> 05:23:55.110]  Yeah, go Goings.
[05:23:55.110 --> 05:23:56.990]  I'm down with that.
[05:23:56.990 --> 05:23:59.030]  Acid Jazz, like Mark Farina?
[05:23:59.030 --> 05:24:00.630]  You ever listen to Mark Farina?
[05:24:02.390 --> 05:24:03.230]  I know the name.
[05:24:04.350 --> 05:24:05.270]  You want to talk about...
[05:24:05.270 --> 05:24:08.430]  Oh, no, he does Mushroom Jazz, my bad, not Acid.
[05:24:08.430 --> 05:24:09.590]  He does Mushroom Jazz.
[05:24:10.550 --> 05:24:12.070]  Oh yeah, no, he's old school.
[05:24:13.590 --> 05:24:15.270]  He's been around forever, right?
[05:24:15.270 --> 05:24:16.110]  Oh yeah.
[05:24:17.390 --> 05:24:19.150]  He's back in your day.
[05:24:19.150 --> 05:24:20.070]  He still kicks it.
[05:24:20.070 --> 05:24:22.190]  I'm sure I've played some of his stuff.
[05:24:27.200 --> 05:24:30.200]  Now in Rhode Island, I have a lot of stuff on vinyl
[05:24:30.920 --> 05:24:33.920]  that I just feel like it doesn't get picked up by...
[05:24:36.520 --> 05:24:37.360]  What's it called?
[05:24:37.360 --> 05:24:38.200]  YouTube?
[05:24:38.200 --> 05:24:41.200]  Well, yeah, YouTube, but also like Shazam
[05:24:41.200 --> 05:24:43.200]  or something like that wouldn't recognize it.
[05:24:43.200 --> 05:24:46.600]  That's kind of the stuff I want to sneak good music
[05:24:46.600 --> 05:24:48.600]  onto here without getting dinged for it.
[05:24:53.600 --> 05:24:55.800]  Yeah, Mark Farina is the shit.
[05:24:55.800 --> 05:24:56.920]  He is the shit.
[05:24:56.920 --> 05:24:59.720]  If you have a guitar, you're a fucking genius.
[05:24:59.880 --> 05:25:02.160]  If you haven't listened to him, boy,
[05:25:02.160 --> 05:25:06.120]  eat some, do a little drop, drop, little drip, drip,
[05:25:06.120 --> 05:25:09.360]  whatever you need, send you to a whole nother level.
[05:25:09.360 --> 05:25:10.800]  You hear the bass line?
[05:25:10.800 --> 05:25:11.640]  Oh yeah.
[05:25:18.000 --> 05:25:19.640]  It's gonna be funny to watch you do a set
[05:25:19.640 --> 05:25:22.680]  when we can get together, put you on the tables.
[05:25:25.880 --> 05:25:27.880]  Okay, let me cue up the next...
[05:25:27.880 --> 05:25:30.080]  I gotta run to the other computer, hold on.
[05:26:02.750 --> 05:26:04.710]  So Peter probably walked away when we went up here,
[05:26:04.710 --> 05:26:06.790]  but there's people in the chat.
[05:26:06.790 --> 05:26:08.030]  There's Peter.
[05:26:08.070 --> 05:26:11.070]  Oh my God, but wait, there's more.
[05:26:12.190 --> 05:26:14.710]  So yeah, again, I just wanted to give another shout out
[05:26:14.710 --> 05:26:17.550]  to Colorado brands that really stick out.
[05:26:17.550 --> 05:26:19.350]  Your brand, Sir David, has stuck out.
[05:26:19.350 --> 05:26:23.150]  I believe I've seen you at expos every time I've been at one.
[05:26:23.150 --> 05:26:25.550]  So we would love to talk to you about, you know,
[05:26:25.550 --> 05:26:27.390]  some of the things that you guys are doing behind the scenes,
[05:26:27.390 --> 05:26:29.150]  the fact that you're in here in Boulder,
[05:26:29.150 --> 05:26:32.190]  and that you have a well-known brand here in Denver.
[05:26:32.190 --> 05:26:36.910]  Yep, so basically, Trill Pills is a CBD pill,
[05:26:36.950 --> 05:26:40.150]  and then we just came up with a CBG pill,
[05:26:40.150 --> 05:26:42.910]  and then we also do a topical.
[05:26:42.910 --> 05:26:46.270]  But I started this in the dispensary
[05:26:46.270 --> 05:26:48.790]  before the hemp bill was passed,
[05:26:48.790 --> 05:26:52.470]  and it was kind of a gray area.
[05:26:52.470 --> 05:26:56.110]  And then in 2016, we brought it out to the public.
[05:26:57.670 --> 05:27:00.830]  So difference about our product,
[05:27:00.830 --> 05:27:03.430]  it's a lipid-based extraction method,
[05:27:03.430 --> 05:27:05.070]  meaning it's a water-based.
[05:27:05.070 --> 05:27:07.230]  It's just like making chicken soup.
[05:27:07.230 --> 05:27:09.110]  We boil the hemp down,
[05:27:09.110 --> 05:27:12.110]  separate all water and fat-soluble,
[05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:14.870]  and by doing that, we add fat in the form
[05:27:14.870 --> 05:27:19.550]  of either coconut oil or MCT oil for our tinctures.
[05:27:19.550 --> 05:27:22.750]  And what happens is all cannabinoids are fat-soluble.
[05:27:22.750 --> 05:27:24.630]  They attach to the fat.
[05:27:24.630 --> 05:27:25.790]  We put it in the fridge.
[05:27:25.790 --> 05:27:27.630]  It coagulates, rises to the top.
[05:27:27.630 --> 05:27:29.230]  We scoop that off.
[05:27:29.230 --> 05:27:32.710]  Everything the plant can upload that would be negative,
[05:27:32.710 --> 05:27:34.950]  pesticides, heavy metals,
[05:27:35.830 --> 05:27:38.030]  all of that is gonna come through its root system,
[05:27:38.030 --> 05:27:39.870]  making them water-soluble.
[05:27:39.870 --> 05:27:42.510]  So by separating water and fat-soluble,
[05:27:42.510 --> 05:27:45.510]  we're able to clean the cannabinoids,
[05:27:45.510 --> 05:27:48.830]  giving us the cleanest product on the market today.
[05:27:48.830 --> 05:27:51.150]  And let's talk about some of those products.
[05:27:51.150 --> 05:27:53.430]  Obviously, you brought three to kind of highlight.
[05:27:53.430 --> 05:27:54.670]  Let's kind of go through those.
[05:27:54.670 --> 05:27:55.510]  Sure.
[05:27:55.510 --> 05:27:59.750]  So the first one we'll start with is just CBD.
[05:27:59.750 --> 05:28:02.710]  So basically, we put it in a capsule form.
[05:28:02.750 --> 05:28:05.790]  And it's a very simple way to get the right dose
[05:28:05.790 --> 05:28:07.510]  that you're getting.
[05:28:07.510 --> 05:28:08.950]  Tinctures are great,
[05:28:08.950 --> 05:28:12.510]  but you're not truly uploading all of it sublingually
[05:28:12.510 --> 05:28:15.190]  when you put a whole dropper under your tongue
[05:28:15.190 --> 05:28:18.070]  because you don't have enough saliva production
[05:28:18.070 --> 05:28:20.550]  to upload all that sublingually.
[05:28:20.550 --> 05:28:23.190]  So you upload some of it sublingually.
[05:28:23.190 --> 05:28:26.070]  The rest is gonna go through your digestive system.
[05:28:26.070 --> 05:28:31.070]  And that skews what you're trying to do a lot of times
[05:28:31.110 --> 05:28:33.150]  when you're trying to get the right dose.
[05:28:33.150 --> 05:28:35.510]  So we put everything in a pill form so you know,
[05:28:35.510 --> 05:28:39.550]  hey, a 10 milligram pill wasn't enough.
[05:28:39.550 --> 05:28:42.070]  The 25 milligram pill wasn't enough.
[05:28:42.070 --> 05:28:44.510]  The 50's perfect or vice versa.
[05:28:44.510 --> 05:28:49.070]  50's too much, the 25's maybe a little too much in the 10's.
[05:28:49.070 --> 05:28:52.590]  We're using a lot of the 10 milligrams for pets.
[05:28:52.590 --> 05:28:55.870]  A lot of companies are out there pushing pet CBD
[05:28:55.870 --> 05:29:00.510]  and charging a premium for it
[05:29:00.790 --> 05:29:02.510]  Yeah, we see a lot of that.
[05:29:02.510 --> 05:29:07.430]  All mammals, any mammal that you have can use CBD.
[05:29:07.430 --> 05:29:08.590]  Absolutely.
[05:29:08.590 --> 05:29:11.310]  And then the one that we just came out with,
[05:29:11.310 --> 05:29:14.190]  well, we came out with it right before the pandemic hit,
[05:29:14.190 --> 05:29:16.210]  is our CBG product.
[05:29:16.210 --> 05:29:19.750]  And with that, we're getting some great response
[05:29:19.750 --> 05:29:20.990]  here at the show.
[05:29:20.990 --> 05:29:24.910]  Problem is a lot of people don't understand what CBG is
[05:29:24.910 --> 05:29:25.830]  and how it works.
[05:29:25.830 --> 05:29:28.790]  And the way I explain that is it's kind of like
[05:29:30.710 --> 05:29:35.070]  CBD but it gives it a little more energy than CBD.
[05:29:35.070 --> 05:29:37.950]  CBD will kind of make you a little more lethargic.
[05:29:37.950 --> 05:29:40.230]  This will keep your energy up.
[05:29:40.230 --> 05:29:43.790]  And it's also good for any stomach issues,
[05:29:43.790 --> 05:29:46.290]  you know, colon cancers, things like that.
[05:29:46.290 --> 05:29:48.430]  And also eye pressure.
[05:29:48.430 --> 05:29:50.790]  So glaucoma, macular degenerate,
[05:29:50.790 --> 05:29:53.510]  things like that that we found our customers
[05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:55.710]  are getting great results with.
[05:29:55.710 --> 05:29:58.030]  Now I remember just, this might have been even
[05:29:58.030 --> 05:29:59.150]  four or five years ago,
[05:29:59.150 --> 05:30:00.590]  there was a gentleman that I was talking to
[05:30:00.590 --> 05:30:01.910]  that was giving a talk.
[05:30:01.910 --> 05:30:03.750]  And he was kind of joking that like,
[05:30:03.750 --> 05:30:05.150]  the real pharmaceutical companies,
[05:30:05.150 --> 05:30:07.350]  they're not afraid of the fact that a bunch of us
[05:30:07.350 --> 05:30:09.790]  are sitting around getting stung.
[05:30:09.790 --> 05:30:12.990]  It's more the CBG that they were afraid of
[05:30:12.990 --> 05:30:14.310]  the community finding out
[05:30:14.310 --> 05:30:18.510]  because that is a real medicinal aspect to a human being.
[05:30:18.510 --> 05:30:19.350]  Right.
[05:30:19.350 --> 05:30:21.350]  So when you think about it,
[05:30:21.350 --> 05:30:24.310]  you know, your endocannabinoid system
[05:30:24.310 --> 05:30:26.330]  controls five major functions.
[05:30:26.330 --> 05:30:30.090]  Eat, sleep, relax, forget, and protect.
[05:30:30.090 --> 05:30:33.090]  So it has a wide variety of things
[05:30:33.090 --> 05:30:35.410]  that it can be useful for.
[05:30:35.410 --> 05:30:36.370]  Absolutely.
[05:30:36.370 --> 05:30:38.490]  I think I saw some people asking about your company, sir.
[05:30:38.490 --> 05:30:40.630]  So this is Trill Pills.
[05:30:40.630 --> 05:30:41.890]  You're based out of Boulder.
[05:30:41.890 --> 05:30:43.090]  Kind of want to go over that again.
[05:30:43.090 --> 05:30:44.330]  There's a lot of people that come on.
[05:30:44.330 --> 05:30:45.170]  Okay.
[05:30:45.170 --> 05:30:46.450]  Boulder, Colorado.
[05:30:46.450 --> 05:30:47.970]  Most of our stuff is online.
[05:30:47.970 --> 05:30:50.930]  You can find us at trillpills.com.
[05:30:51.850 --> 05:30:53.610]  We sell to some stores,
[05:30:53.610 --> 05:30:57.530]  but mostly we go direct to the customers.
[05:30:57.530 --> 05:31:01.250]  And by doing that, we're able to keep our prices lower
[05:31:01.250 --> 05:31:04.050]  by not having storefronts and things like that.
[05:31:04.050 --> 05:31:06.410]  And, you know, we do shipping and things.
[05:31:07.530 --> 05:31:09.930]  I see there's a question from James down there.
[05:31:09.930 --> 05:31:11.290]  If you could answer this, sir.
[05:31:11.290 --> 05:31:13.330]  What is the highest percentage
[05:31:13.330 --> 05:31:16.010]  that cultivators get on CBG nowadays?
[05:31:16.010 --> 05:31:17.210]  Do you happen to know that?
[05:31:17.210 --> 05:31:19.130]  You know, I don't handle
[05:31:19.130 --> 05:31:21.830]  the actual cultivation aspect of it.
[05:31:21.830 --> 05:31:25.830]  So I wouldn't know, to be honest with you.
[05:31:28.230 --> 05:31:29.590]  All right, well, do you guys have
[05:31:29.590 --> 05:31:31.710]  any other questions for him?
[05:31:31.710 --> 05:31:35.510]  You know, our show is mostly geared to growers.
[05:31:35.510 --> 05:31:37.390]  What extraction method do you use?
[05:31:37.390 --> 05:31:40.790]  So, like I said, it's a lipid-based extraction method.
[05:31:40.790 --> 05:31:45.790]  So no solvents, no chemicals, water-based.
[05:31:47.590 --> 05:31:49.590]  It's a lot like making chicken soup.
[05:31:49.590 --> 05:31:54.590]  So you boil it down and we separate water and fat soluble.
[05:31:54.950 --> 05:31:57.270]  And then we add fat to the mixture.
[05:31:57.270 --> 05:31:59.590]  The cannabinoids attach to that.
[05:31:59.590 --> 05:32:01.550]  And then we put it in the fridge.
[05:32:01.550 --> 05:32:03.390]  Coagulates, rises to the top.
[05:32:03.390 --> 05:32:05.750]  We scoop that off, test it,
[05:32:05.750 --> 05:32:07.910]  and then we run it into products.
[05:32:07.910 --> 05:32:10.270]  And each of our products then is tested twice
[05:32:10.270 --> 05:32:12.070]  to make sure that when I tell you
[05:32:12.070 --> 05:32:13.990]  you're getting a 25 milligram,
[05:32:13.990 --> 05:32:16.110]  you're getting a 25 milligram.
[05:32:16.110 --> 05:32:19.310]  Yeah, which we all know, even just a few years ago,
[05:32:20.070 --> 05:32:22.550]  and I think I'd like you said,
[05:32:22.550 --> 05:32:24.070]  we saw each other at other shows.
[05:32:24.070 --> 05:32:29.070]  We won best capsule two years in a row at another expo.
[05:32:29.150 --> 05:32:32.150]  And during that time, people kept coming up to us saying,
[05:32:32.150 --> 05:32:34.470]  you know, what did your stuff test out at?
[05:32:34.470 --> 05:32:36.150]  Because, you know, ours didn't test out
[05:32:36.150 --> 05:32:37.630]  where they said it was going to.
[05:32:37.630 --> 05:32:39.030]  And the other thing you gotta worry about
[05:32:39.030 --> 05:32:40.830]  when you're testing your products,
[05:32:40.830 --> 05:32:43.230]  especially is with capsules,
[05:32:43.230 --> 05:32:47.830]  is sometimes if you're not asking,
[05:32:48.550 --> 05:32:50.950]  they'll put the capsule in part of the weight.
[05:32:50.950 --> 05:32:54.030]  So that's what skews your readings off.
[05:32:54.030 --> 05:32:54.870]  I didn't know that.
[05:32:54.870 --> 05:32:56.430]  That's another one.
[05:32:56.430 --> 05:32:58.870]  .08 kind of thing, every day.
[05:32:58.870 --> 05:32:59.710]  Is this a G?
[05:32:59.710 --> 05:33:00.550]  Yeah, man, .08.
[05:33:06.340 --> 05:33:08.780]  Do you want to take a, we can take a CBD,
[05:33:08.780 --> 05:33:10.780]  crystalline dab, do you dab it also?
[05:33:10.780 --> 05:33:11.620]  Why wouldn't I?
[05:33:11.620 --> 05:33:12.660]  All right.
[05:33:12.660 --> 05:33:13.940]  There's a rig down there.
[05:33:13.940 --> 05:33:15.700]  You want to set that up, so.
[05:33:15.700 --> 05:33:16.540]  Oh my.
[05:33:17.540 --> 05:33:21.580]  We'll get the music going again.
[05:33:21.580 --> 05:33:22.700]  That's a little tool.
[05:33:22.700 --> 05:33:25.180]  I was gonna say, that's pretty cool.
[05:33:25.180 --> 05:33:27.460]  We'll get to Garrett come over.
[05:33:27.460 --> 05:33:30.100]  This is the Garrett, and this is all his set up here.
[05:33:32.140 --> 05:33:33.380]  Hey, do we have any water, bro?
[05:33:33.380 --> 05:33:36.180]  I ain't drinking any water.
[05:33:36.180 --> 05:33:38.420]  You gotta scoop with these masks on.
[05:33:38.420 --> 05:33:39.260]  Yeah, man.
[05:33:39.260 --> 05:33:42.380]  By the way, did you guys eat anything today?
[05:33:42.380 --> 05:33:43.860]  No, not yet.
[05:33:43.860 --> 05:33:45.220]  I did.
[05:33:45.660 --> 05:33:49.140]  I had a couple leftover chicken wings from last night.
[05:33:49.140 --> 05:33:49.980]  It's all good, though.
[05:33:49.980 --> 05:33:52.820]  I really have embraced the intermittent fasting lately.
[05:33:52.820 --> 05:33:54.740]  I'm in full autophagy right now.
[05:33:56.540 --> 05:33:58.820]  Yeah, what is autophagy?
[05:33:58.820 --> 05:34:00.420]  Autophagy is something that I feel like
[05:34:00.420 --> 05:34:03.500]  was just discovered, don't quote me on this,
[05:34:03.500 --> 05:34:04.700]  because I'm learning it as I go,
[05:34:04.700 --> 05:34:09.100]  but maybe like pretty recently, maybe 20, 30 years ago.
[05:34:09.100 --> 05:34:13.100]  And it's basically that the body will start to eat itself
[05:34:13.100 --> 05:34:14.740]  when no food is provided.
[05:34:15.340 --> 05:34:18.940]  The best way, an analogy that I've ever seen it explained,
[05:34:18.940 --> 05:34:21.860]  is imagine being able to take old wood,
[05:34:21.860 --> 05:34:24.900]  old nails, screws, all that kind of stuff,
[05:34:24.900 --> 05:34:26.500]  be able to recycle that,
[05:34:26.500 --> 05:34:30.180]  and out of that comes brand new cabinet shelves,
[05:34:30.180 --> 05:34:31.180]  that kind of thing.
[05:34:31.180 --> 05:34:34.140]  And so basically what the body is doing at that point,
[05:34:34.140 --> 05:34:36.540]  this is usually around the 16 to 18 hour mark,
[05:34:36.540 --> 05:34:38.220]  depending on your body,
[05:34:38.220 --> 05:34:41.820]  will begin to break what's known as folded proteins.
[05:34:41.820 --> 05:34:43.380]  So folded proteins, I guess,
[05:34:43.380 --> 05:34:46.420]  are one of the main reasons why a lot of us out there
[05:34:46.420 --> 05:34:48.900]  have a bunch of issues in life,
[05:34:48.900 --> 05:34:51.940]  especially some of that comes from the gallbladder.
[05:34:51.940 --> 05:34:53.420]  I mean, I could talk about a lot of this stuff,
[05:34:53.420 --> 05:34:57.860]  but autophagy, the main point of it is that it recycles
[05:34:57.860 --> 05:35:02.540]  old folded proteins into brand new material
[05:35:02.540 --> 05:35:03.700]  for the body to use.
[05:35:05.460 --> 05:35:06.700]  Does that make sense?
[05:35:06.700 --> 05:35:09.180]  So is autophagy in the body a good thing?
[05:35:09.180 --> 05:35:11.180]  Like when you starve yourself a little bit,
[05:35:12.180 --> 05:35:14.420]  the body reacts to it?
[05:35:14.420 --> 05:35:15.340]  I wanna make it clear
[05:35:15.340 --> 05:35:16.940]  that if you're doing intermittent fasting,
[05:35:16.940 --> 05:35:19.460]  you're not starving yourself, your body's still eating.
[05:35:19.460 --> 05:35:23.060]  It's just the fact that it's eating your own fat.
[05:35:23.060 --> 05:35:25.420]  So you don't, like right now I don't feel hungry.
[05:35:25.420 --> 05:35:27.700]  I haven't eaten since 8 p.m. last night,
[05:35:28.620 --> 05:35:30.900]  but my body's running on ketones.
[05:35:30.900 --> 05:35:33.540]  So yes, would it be nice to go get something to eat?
[05:35:33.540 --> 05:35:36.580]  100%, but I'm not feening for it or anything.
[05:35:36.580 --> 05:35:38.780]  Like I used to, I used to crave,
[05:35:39.620 --> 05:35:41.300]  like with sugars and that kind of stuff.
[05:35:41.300 --> 05:35:43.620]  So that's why I do wanna get to the audience.
[05:35:43.620 --> 05:35:46.020]  Like if you guys are able to get to the point
[05:35:46.020 --> 05:35:47.140]  where you're intermittent fasting,
[05:35:47.140 --> 05:35:49.340]  and of course you start at intermittent fasting,
[05:35:49.340 --> 05:35:51.180]  maybe just start out at 12 hours.
[05:35:51.180 --> 05:35:52.780]  Get to the point after a few weeks
[05:35:52.780 --> 05:35:55.980]  to where you can get to the autophagy level,
[05:35:55.980 --> 05:35:58.100]  and then start to take products like this.
[05:35:58.100 --> 05:36:01.020]  Enjoy CBG, crystalline, CBG, crystalline,
[05:36:01.020 --> 05:36:03.820]  take Trill pills, and that will continue
[05:36:03.820 --> 05:36:05.060]  to improve the process.
[05:36:05.060 --> 05:36:07.740]  And I promise you guys that your gut health
[05:36:07.780 --> 05:36:11.500]  is going to improve dramatically, drastically.
[05:36:11.500 --> 05:36:15.420]  I can't give that to the community enough.
[05:36:15.420 --> 05:36:18.020]  If you have issues, the main thing in life
[05:36:18.020 --> 05:36:20.540]  is to stop eating, stop snacking,
[05:36:20.540 --> 05:36:22.540]  and you will see the benefits.
[05:36:22.540 --> 05:36:24.540]  So let's, where's that dab?
[05:36:24.540 --> 05:36:25.420]  You just did it.
[05:36:25.420 --> 05:36:30.420]  I'll tell you, I had a customer whose dog had cancer,
[05:36:32.940 --> 05:36:36.900]  and they did a water fast for 14 days,
[05:36:36.900 --> 05:36:40.660]  and they did four times a day
[05:36:40.660 --> 05:36:43.900]  the 10 milligram CBD pills that we have,
[05:36:43.900 --> 05:36:48.900]  and the cancer that the dog had, the mass fell off.
[05:36:49.100 --> 05:36:50.300]  It detached from the body.
[05:36:50.300 --> 05:36:52.300]  When you come back to the booth,
[05:36:52.300 --> 05:36:54.580]  I'll show you the pictures.
[05:36:54.580 --> 05:36:56.980]  So it's exactly what you're talking about,
[05:36:56.980 --> 05:36:59.380]  you know, not eating and fasting,
[05:36:59.380 --> 05:37:00.860]  but that's a little different.
[05:37:00.860 --> 05:37:02.260]  I'm doing the same thing you're doing.
[05:37:02.260 --> 05:37:06.380]  I haven't eaten all day, and I still have energy,
[05:37:06.660 --> 05:37:09.540]  but obviously I'll eat something a little bit later.
[05:37:09.540 --> 05:37:13.140]  Right, and then again, there's two basic fuel sources.
[05:37:13.140 --> 05:37:16.380]  So growing up in Georgia, everyone taught me
[05:37:16.380 --> 05:37:19.740]  to basically run on carbohydrates, sugars,
[05:37:19.740 --> 05:37:21.620]  but there is a different fuel source,
[05:37:21.620 --> 05:37:23.780]  and that is what's known as ketones.
[05:37:23.780 --> 05:37:25.500]  And if your body gets to the point
[05:37:25.500 --> 05:37:27.060]  where it's running on ketones,
[05:37:27.060 --> 05:37:30.860]  that's why you and I can have a coherent conversation.
[05:37:30.860 --> 05:37:33.780]  I may be speaking for myself, stone talking to you,
[05:37:33.820 --> 05:37:36.860]  but being able to still carry out a conversation,
[05:37:36.860 --> 05:37:39.460]  feel good, I don't feel lethargic,
[05:37:39.460 --> 05:37:42.700]  like if we were completely running on carbohydrates,
[05:37:42.700 --> 05:37:44.540]  I would probably have a headache by now.
[05:37:44.540 --> 05:37:45.820]  No peaks and valleys.
[05:37:45.820 --> 05:37:47.620]  Yeah, absolutely.
[05:37:47.620 --> 05:37:50.260]  So check that out if you guys can make that happen.
[05:37:50.260 --> 05:37:53.260]  And again, this is all like baby steps.
[05:37:53.260 --> 05:37:56.260]  I didn't fast for 18 hours to start.
[05:37:56.260 --> 05:37:59.100]  I think I started eight hours, and that was enough for me,
[05:37:59.100 --> 05:38:00.980]  and then I worked it up to 12.
[05:38:01.020 --> 05:38:04.900]  But the magic I promise you is in the 16 to 18 hour mark.
[05:38:04.900 --> 05:38:07.580]  And every hour past that, like if you can go,
[05:38:07.580 --> 05:38:09.500]  let's say you just did 18 hours,
[05:38:09.500 --> 05:38:10.340]  and then the next day you're like,
[05:38:10.340 --> 05:38:12.180]  ah, I could probably go 19.
[05:38:12.180 --> 05:38:13.820]  There are extreme benefits
[05:38:13.820 --> 05:38:16.020]  if you're able to do that extra hour.
[05:38:16.020 --> 05:38:20.060]  An hour in your body's timeframe is a lot at that point.
[05:38:20.060 --> 05:38:23.340]  So every hour that you go above that 18 hour mark
[05:38:23.340 --> 05:38:25.460]  is extremely beneficial,
[05:38:25.460 --> 05:38:27.420]  and you're gonna sleep better as well.
[05:38:27.420 --> 05:38:29.380]  I know this might be sounding like almost too good
[05:38:29.380 --> 05:38:31.580]  to be true, so please fact check me on that.
[05:38:31.580 --> 05:38:34.700]  Check people out that have really studied autophagy
[05:38:34.700 --> 05:38:36.860]  that are using intermittent fasting.
[05:38:36.860 --> 05:38:39.380]  This is, again, everything that we talk about
[05:38:39.380 --> 05:38:41.060]  with living soil on Thursdays,
[05:38:41.060 --> 05:38:45.340]  none of that stuff is my research, our research at all.
[05:38:45.340 --> 05:38:46.460]  Again, this is another thing
[05:38:46.460 --> 05:38:47.740]  that I wanna give to the community
[05:38:47.740 --> 05:38:49.780]  is the fact that autophagy works,
[05:38:49.780 --> 05:38:51.780]  and there's nothing, no magic thing
[05:38:51.780 --> 05:38:53.300]  you need to go out and purchase.
[05:38:53.300 --> 05:38:56.180]  You literally just have to stop feeding your face
[05:38:56.180 --> 05:38:58.300]  and start to get a little bit disciplined.
[05:38:58.300 --> 05:39:00.520]  And once you're disciplined, I assure you,
[05:39:00.520 --> 05:39:02.500]  a lot of that stuff, a lot of those issues
[05:39:02.500 --> 05:39:04.620]  that you're dealing with on a day-to-day basis
[05:39:04.620 --> 05:39:07.980]  is going to minimize or just be reduced.
[05:39:07.980 --> 05:39:10.580]  That yeast that you guys have that's a beast at night
[05:39:10.580 --> 05:39:12.780]  that makes you wanna eat candy all the time,
[05:39:12.780 --> 05:39:15.580]  that is going to be diminished as well.
[05:39:15.580 --> 05:39:17.020]  The cravings go away too.
[05:39:17.020 --> 05:39:18.340]  Cravings, yeah.
[05:39:18.340 --> 05:39:20.820]  It's a wonderful thing to go by the aisle,
[05:39:20.820 --> 05:39:23.000]  and one of my sons wants candy,
[05:39:23.000 --> 05:39:25.700]  and I don't wanna grab the peanut butter M&Ms,
[05:39:25.700 --> 05:39:28.180]  because that used to be my fucking kryptonite.
[05:39:29.020 --> 05:39:30.420]  If I was shopping stone,
[05:39:30.420 --> 05:39:33.180]  those were definitely in the back in the shopping cart.
[05:39:34.060 --> 05:39:35.740]  So you guys said, this is a busy man here.
[05:39:35.740 --> 05:39:36.940]  I don't wanna take up too much time,
[05:39:36.940 --> 05:39:40.500]  but yes, using these kinds of products,
[05:39:40.500 --> 05:39:43.820]  taking the time, drinking water, mountain water,
[05:39:43.820 --> 05:39:44.660]  going out of your way.
[05:39:44.660 --> 05:39:48.540]  I like El Dorado water here in Colorado.
[05:39:48.540 --> 05:39:50.420]  Just those little things, those little,
[05:39:50.420 --> 05:39:51.700]  we've been basically talking about,
[05:39:51.700 --> 05:39:53.100]  all those little things add up,
[05:39:53.100 --> 05:39:55.300]  and when it comes to health, again,
[05:39:55.300 --> 05:39:59.180]  just stop eating, and things are going to change.
[05:39:59.180 --> 05:40:00.020]  Stop snacking.
[05:40:00.020 --> 05:40:00.900]  Same thing with the CBD, right?
[05:40:00.900 --> 05:40:03.580]  You just can't take CBD and it cures everything.
[05:40:03.580 --> 05:40:05.460]  You have to do exactly what you're talking about.
[05:40:05.460 --> 05:40:08.380]  You gotta eat clean, you gotta do your exercises
[05:40:08.380 --> 05:40:10.580]  and stretches and things like that.
[05:40:10.580 --> 05:40:11.420]  Absolutely.
[05:40:11.420 --> 05:40:12.580]  And go outside.
[05:40:12.580 --> 05:40:15.620]  Vitamin D is extremely important for gut health.
[05:40:15.620 --> 05:40:16.900]  So a lot of you, they're talking about
[05:40:16.900 --> 05:40:18.780]  you have depression and all this kind of,
[05:40:18.780 --> 05:40:20.980]  go outside, I assure you.
[05:40:20.980 --> 05:40:22.140]  Things will change for you.
[05:40:22.140 --> 05:40:23.220]  Stop being fat.
[05:40:23.220 --> 05:40:24.660]  Did I miss the dab?
[05:40:26.300 --> 05:40:29.140]  It was like a magical dab for me too.
[05:40:29.140 --> 05:40:30.060]  Oh, I did one.
[05:40:31.660 --> 05:40:32.500]  I got so beat up.
[05:40:32.500 --> 05:40:34.140]  I'm that good at my job, Peter.
[05:40:37.220 --> 05:40:40.260]  All right, well, we thank you for joining us
[05:40:40.260 --> 05:40:41.620]  and stopping by.
[05:40:42.580 --> 05:40:43.420]  Yeah, thank you, sir.
[05:40:43.420 --> 05:40:44.580]  I appreciate the time.
[05:40:44.580 --> 05:40:45.420]  Yeah, absolutely.
[05:40:45.420 --> 05:40:47.140]  We'll run by your booth tomorrow as well.
[05:40:47.140 --> 05:40:48.780]  Thanks, yeah, come check that out.
[05:40:48.780 --> 05:40:50.620]  I think when you see the pictures
[05:40:50.620 --> 05:40:52.780]  of what we just were talking about,
[05:40:53.300 --> 05:40:55.180]  it really cements it into you.
[05:40:55.180 --> 05:40:56.020]  Oh, yeah.
[05:40:56.020 --> 05:40:56.860]  All right, peace.
[05:40:56.860 --> 05:40:59.100]  Nice to meet you, sir.
[05:40:59.100 --> 05:41:01.340]  All right, Peter, so most of those people
[05:41:01.340 --> 05:41:02.740]  have packed up up there.
[05:41:02.740 --> 05:41:04.340]  Yeah, we're good.
[05:41:04.340 --> 05:41:07.860]  I think five hours and 40 minutes in, we're-
[05:41:07.860 --> 05:41:08.820]  Stay long.
[05:41:08.820 --> 05:41:09.660]  Yeah, buddy.
[05:41:09.660 --> 05:41:10.500]  Thank you, sir.
[05:41:10.500 --> 05:41:11.700]  We can call it a night.
[05:41:11.700 --> 05:41:13.060]  You're a warrior, man.
[05:41:13.060 --> 05:41:13.900]  Absolutely.
[05:41:14.980 --> 05:41:16.860]  So welcome to my world.
[05:41:16.860 --> 05:41:20.900]  This is your taste of conference production.
[05:41:21.900 --> 05:41:25.900]  Yeah, and I will tell you that I feel that,
[05:41:25.900 --> 05:41:29.500]  you know, they're kind of the bottom of the barrel
[05:41:29.500 --> 05:41:30.620]  because you didn't sponsor.
[05:41:30.620 --> 05:41:31.460]  They don't give a fuck.
[05:41:31.460 --> 05:41:32.660]  They don't answer the question.
[05:41:32.660 --> 05:41:35.180]  But for the most part, though,
[05:41:35.180 --> 05:41:36.020]  everyone on the second floor-
[05:41:36.020 --> 05:41:36.860]  I was gonna ask that.
[05:41:36.860 --> 05:41:37.700]  I was gonna be like,
[05:41:37.700 --> 05:41:39.500]  so do you wanna sponsor this show?
[05:41:41.500 --> 05:41:42.900]  We're working on that, Peter.
[05:41:42.900 --> 05:41:44.460]  Believe me.
[05:41:44.460 --> 05:41:45.540]  There's just a lot of people.
[05:41:45.540 --> 05:41:48.140]  And we were talking to some of my marketing friends
[05:41:48.140 --> 05:41:49.220]  in California.
[05:41:49.420 --> 05:41:51.420]  That's why we've been putting up the views and all that
[05:41:51.420 --> 05:41:54.060]  is because they say that the one million view mark
[05:41:54.060 --> 05:41:56.860]  is where if we sold t-shirts-
[05:41:56.860 --> 05:41:58.740]  He's like, nah, I did that.
[05:42:00.060 --> 05:42:02.740]  To me, it's just throw it in front of a bunch of people
[05:42:02.740 --> 05:42:04.860]  and someone says yes.
[05:42:04.860 --> 05:42:08.100]  No, I'm just saying what she said about any marketing.
[05:42:08.100 --> 05:42:10.300]  So that's why I was saying our goal
[05:42:10.300 --> 05:42:12.220]  is to just continue what we're doing.
[05:42:12.220 --> 05:42:14.420]  And I think things will work out.
[05:42:16.460 --> 05:42:18.100]  I'm trying to build a Super Bowl team
[05:42:18.100 --> 05:42:19.940]  and not everyone can be on the team.
[05:42:23.430 --> 05:42:24.270]  Facts.
[05:42:26.230 --> 05:42:28.390]  All right, can you guys hear the music?
[05:42:28.390 --> 05:42:29.870]  Yep.
[05:42:29.870 --> 05:42:32.310]  Hey, is that a lion head bunny on your computer?
[05:42:35.710 --> 05:42:38.230]  Well, that'd be a question for Gemma.
[05:42:39.670 --> 05:42:41.310]  That is her Easter bunny.
[05:42:46.510 --> 05:42:49.350]  Gemma was prolific with the drawing this past week.
[05:42:49.470 --> 05:42:55.380]  So we got Easter bunnies and all sorts of stuff.
[05:42:58.380 --> 05:43:01.300]  Yes, we've really been talking for five hours.
[05:43:01.300 --> 05:43:02.140]  Almost six.
[05:43:03.140 --> 05:43:07.140]  John, the founder of Front Range
[05:43:09.900 --> 05:43:11.940]  is down to do something tomorrow.
[05:43:13.140 --> 05:43:14.860]  Okay, let me ask you this real quick
[05:43:14.860 --> 05:43:16.100]  and I'll ask the viewers.
[05:43:16.100 --> 05:43:18.860]  Do you guys want us to continue with doing the interviews
[05:43:18.900 --> 05:43:21.460]  or there is some interesting speakers tomorrow
[05:43:21.460 --> 05:43:23.660]  in that fancy room I was telling you about?
[05:43:25.660 --> 05:43:27.460]  I mean, maybe we could do like a session,
[05:43:27.460 --> 05:43:30.420]  but I would say if we could get,
[05:43:30.420 --> 05:43:32.900]  instead of the little shotgun,
[05:43:32.900 --> 05:43:37.700]  an audio cable to that same adapter and test it.
[05:43:37.700 --> 05:43:40.660]  And if it gives us a clean audio signal,
[05:43:41.700 --> 05:43:42.540]  we could do a set.
[05:43:42.540 --> 05:43:43.580]  I mean, but this stuff's fun.
[05:43:43.580 --> 05:43:45.940]  I mean, I feel like I'll play music
[05:43:45.980 --> 05:43:47.980]  in between interviews.
[05:43:49.060 --> 05:43:50.500]  All right, maybe we'll just keep it like this
[05:43:50.500 --> 05:43:52.940]  because there are a lot more people to interview,
[05:43:52.940 --> 05:43:55.460]  especially now that I know there's a third floor.
[05:43:57.180 --> 05:43:59.220]  You're just discovering that.
[05:43:59.220 --> 05:44:00.060]  No one knew.
[05:44:00.060 --> 05:44:00.900]  That's why everyone's,
[05:44:00.900 --> 05:44:03.540]  if you go up right now, people are pissed.
[05:44:03.540 --> 05:44:05.420]  Nobody told anyone.
[05:44:05.420 --> 05:44:07.300]  The people on the third floor are pissed
[05:44:07.300 --> 05:44:09.060]  because they paid attention.
[05:44:09.060 --> 05:44:10.980]  Everybody's been on the second floor.
[05:44:11.940 --> 05:44:12.820]  I had to move twice.
[05:44:12.820 --> 05:44:14.060]  Nobody's even down here.
[05:44:16.460 --> 05:44:20.420]  You guys got a very spacious room to yourselves.
[05:44:21.940 --> 05:44:24.380]  Well, maybe we can take up one of those people
[05:44:24.380 --> 05:44:26.700]  that want us to put up there by the roof.
[05:44:26.700 --> 05:44:27.820]  That'd be kind of cool.
[05:44:27.820 --> 05:44:30.260]  You can move the dad door up to the third floor.
[05:44:30.260 --> 05:44:32.220]  Well, if there's no ethernet,
[05:44:32.220 --> 05:44:34.980]  then our video is gonna look like poo-poo sauce.
[05:44:35.900 --> 05:44:37.380]  If it's just on wifi here.
[05:44:37.380 --> 05:44:39.220]  Well, which it did all day.
[05:44:39.220 --> 05:44:43.020]  Actually, now you guys, we went from 8-bit to HD.
[05:44:43.020 --> 05:44:45.100]  Well, that's because everybody left already.
[05:44:45.140 --> 05:44:46.580]  I know, but look at that.
[05:44:46.580 --> 05:44:48.940]  That is clean.
[05:44:48.940 --> 05:44:49.860]  Look at that wall.
[05:44:51.060 --> 05:44:51.940]  Beautiful place.
[05:44:51.940 --> 05:44:55.140]  Next time we need future cannabis project right here, Peter.
[05:44:55.140 --> 05:44:57.740]  I kind of like the brick wall.
[05:44:57.740 --> 05:44:58.580]  Yeah.
[05:44:58.580 --> 05:45:00.540]  The concrete brick wall.
[05:45:00.540 --> 05:45:01.420]  It's a good look.
[05:45:03.460 --> 05:45:05.460]  We're no frills.
[05:45:07.980 --> 05:45:11.820]  People are digging the dab bar.
[05:45:11.820 --> 05:45:13.620]  I'm glad you guys can see it.
[05:45:13.620 --> 05:45:15.540]  We're trying to make it where you guys,
[05:45:15.540 --> 05:45:19.260]  we have all the sponsors down here too on these little TVs,
[05:45:19.260 --> 05:45:21.140]  but for what?
[05:45:21.140 --> 05:45:22.260]  Production sake.
[05:45:22.260 --> 05:45:23.940]  It looks better when it's closer.
[05:45:25.060 --> 05:45:27.260]  We got a lot of, actually, you could probably lower it
[05:45:27.260 --> 05:45:31.420]  because we got a lot of concrete headspace above you guys.
[05:45:32.300 --> 05:45:33.620]  We're on that table, though.
[05:45:33.620 --> 05:45:34.700]  I don't know what we can do.
[05:45:34.700 --> 05:45:35.540]  Maybe.
[05:45:35.540 --> 05:45:36.380]  Let's see, let's see.
[05:45:42.390 --> 05:45:43.510]  Up a tiny bit.
[05:45:46.110 --> 05:45:51.830]  Set up a little bit.
[05:45:53.790 --> 05:45:56.700]  Yep.
[05:45:56.700 --> 05:45:57.700]  Right there, he said.
[05:45:58.940 --> 05:46:00.660]  All right, that's how you want it for tomorrow?
[05:46:00.660 --> 05:46:02.060]  Well, basically with that-
[05:46:02.060 --> 05:46:04.060]  And I'm saying, how does it feel to want?
[05:46:05.620 --> 05:46:10.060]  I would move the TV with a camera.
[05:46:10.060 --> 05:46:11.060]  Well, he can't hear.
[05:46:11.060 --> 05:46:15.420]  I'd move the whole TV with a camera back like two feet
[05:46:15.420 --> 05:46:20.420]  and you'll get you guys with the screens below
[05:46:21.260 --> 05:46:22.460]  in frame.
[05:46:25.380 --> 05:46:26.340]  Like you're close.
[05:46:26.340 --> 05:46:30.020]  Like I can see the top half of those screens.
[05:46:30.940 --> 05:46:32.780]  Because I have the camera on top of the TV,
[05:46:32.780 --> 05:46:34.300]  not on a tripod.
[05:46:34.300 --> 05:46:35.380]  No, no, no, I get that.
[05:46:35.380 --> 05:46:37.860]  So can you move that whole setup back to me?
[05:46:37.860 --> 05:46:39.660]  He's saying just move the table back.
[05:46:39.660 --> 05:46:42.300]  Oh yeah, we're going to look smaller then.
[05:46:42.300 --> 05:46:44.340]  That's it, no, no, well, but you'll-
[05:46:45.740 --> 05:46:47.180]  You'll just try it.
[05:46:47.180 --> 05:46:48.020]  You're going to try it?
[05:46:48.020 --> 05:46:49.180]  All right, let's try it real quick
[05:46:49.180 --> 05:46:50.020]  so it's all set up for tomorrow.
[05:46:50.620 --> 05:46:51.460]  Stay here.
[05:46:52.420 --> 05:46:53.260]  Watch how small you get.
[05:46:53.260 --> 05:46:55.820]  We have a hundred friends to tell us how it looks.
[05:46:58.780 --> 05:47:00.340]  We appreciate you guys.
[05:47:00.340 --> 05:47:01.700]  We're doing this for you guys
[05:47:01.700 --> 05:47:06.700]  so you guys can see that at least live events are back.
[05:47:07.180 --> 05:47:08.620]  No budget production.
[05:47:10.060 --> 05:47:11.860]  I don't know about no budget.
[05:47:11.860 --> 05:47:14.500]  All right, so now, all right, that's good, that's good.
[05:47:14.500 --> 05:47:19.500]  So now tilt down till you're about six inches above his head.
[05:47:19.620 --> 05:47:22.220]  Tilt down till you're six inches above my head.
[05:47:25.640 --> 05:47:28.480]  And obviously if you get like minute bowl as a guest,
[05:47:28.480 --> 05:47:32.500]  then that's too-
[05:47:32.500 --> 05:47:33.500]  Tiny bit up.
[05:47:37.590 --> 05:47:38.430]  Yeah.
[05:47:40.470 --> 05:47:41.470]  Okay.
[05:47:41.470 --> 05:47:43.030]  All right, we're getting there.
[05:47:44.870 --> 05:47:46.110]  Is that good?
[05:47:46.110 --> 05:47:47.870]  That's close, we're getting close.
[05:47:49.470 --> 05:47:51.430]  What do we need, back it up a little bit more?
[05:47:51.430 --> 05:47:52.710]  We can tweak it tomorrow,
[05:47:52.750 --> 05:47:55.430]  but I mean, now we have both the view and frame
[05:47:55.430 --> 05:47:58.430]  and although that's Boku,
[05:48:02.320 --> 05:48:06.320]  super food, super living, botanical.
[05:48:08.480 --> 05:48:10.440]  That Boku place on the third floor.
[05:48:13.440 --> 05:48:14.280]  That's homie.
[05:48:16.400 --> 05:48:19.880]  So is this just cycling through like the brands
[05:48:19.880 --> 05:48:21.480]  that are at the event?
[05:48:21.480 --> 05:48:23.400]  Yep, the sponsors.
[05:48:24.320 --> 05:48:26.360]  Yeah, anyone from Patagonia there?
[05:48:27.600 --> 05:48:28.720]  Yeah, but I couldn't find them.
[05:48:28.720 --> 05:48:30.520]  I couldn't find Pure Pressure.
[05:48:30.520 --> 05:48:32.600]  I don't know where some of those bigger brands are.
[05:48:32.600 --> 05:48:34.280]  Yeah, Pure, we could talk Hash
[05:48:34.280 --> 05:48:36.800]  and then with Patagonia, just kind of general
[05:48:36.800 --> 05:48:39.400]  like what they're doing with-
[05:48:41.960 --> 05:48:44.600]  Yeah, although, I mean, we interviewed a lot of people
[05:48:44.600 --> 05:48:47.560]  so I'll have time to find more of those people tonight.
[05:48:47.560 --> 05:48:49.280]  We're gonna go to after party too
[05:48:49.280 --> 05:48:52.560]  so we might be able to find where their booths are.
[05:48:52.600 --> 05:48:55.280]  All right, well, why don't we call it
[05:48:55.280 --> 05:48:56.800]  and you guys can relax?
[05:48:58.080 --> 05:49:00.120]  Definitely getting stoned tonight, boys.
[05:49:01.240 --> 05:49:02.080]  Absolutely.
[05:49:02.960 --> 05:49:05.360]  Well, Peter, appreciate everything you do, man.
[05:49:05.360 --> 05:49:07.640]  You know, we couldn't do this without you, buddy.
[05:49:08.600 --> 05:49:10.480]  And everyone watching will be back.
[05:49:13.150 --> 05:49:16.110]  Shout out to Mr. Daguerre Fortier again,
[05:49:16.110 --> 05:49:20.550]  Melo Vora, the best dab bars in the country, in the world.
[05:49:21.550 --> 05:49:24.630]  So yeah, James, this may be,
[05:49:27.390 --> 05:49:32.310]  I believe we passed the Clackamas Coot
[05:49:33.830 --> 05:49:34.990]  five hour and change.
[05:49:34.990 --> 05:49:37.550]  Wow, cause I got to talk forever.
[05:49:39.190 --> 05:49:40.630]  Shout out to Clackamas Coot.
[05:49:42.430 --> 05:49:44.030]  All right, well, let's call it.
[05:49:47.550 --> 05:49:48.950]  We will see you guys tomorrow.
[05:49:48.990 --> 05:49:51.190]  Let's talk in the early morning.
[05:49:52.190 --> 05:49:55.230]  So like for example, Jonathan Boyd from
[05:49:57.870 --> 05:50:00.270]  Front Range, like I sent a group email
[05:50:00.270 --> 05:50:01.590]  with both of you guys and him.
[05:50:01.590 --> 05:50:03.950]  He's down to come after his session tomorrow.
[05:50:05.590 --> 05:50:08.430]  But I like the idea of like, you know,
[05:50:08.430 --> 05:50:12.030]  talking with labs about kind of what's going on
[05:50:12.030 --> 05:50:13.070]  in that world.
[05:50:13.070 --> 05:50:14.990]  Yeah, we'll just do, we'll do all the talking
[05:50:14.990 --> 05:50:17.350]  cause we're gonna have a good time.
[05:50:17.390 --> 05:50:18.950]  We'll do all the talking cause
[05:50:20.990 --> 05:50:23.350]  there's a lot of big, big media in there.
[05:50:23.350 --> 05:50:25.910]  I don't even know how close we could get.
[05:50:25.910 --> 05:50:28.070]  I feel like this would probably be beneficial,
[05:50:28.070 --> 05:50:29.870]  more beneficial to the viewers.
[05:50:32.190 --> 05:50:35.230]  Yeah, we'll just go all, we'll be all over the place.
[05:50:35.230 --> 05:50:39.310]  We'll do some medical, some lab stuff,
[05:50:39.310 --> 05:50:43.030]  some hemp, some breeding, some cultivating things.
[05:50:43.030 --> 05:50:45.430]  And if you guys know of people that you would like me
[05:50:45.470 --> 05:50:48.270]  to go get, DM me or Peter.
[05:50:48.270 --> 05:50:51.630]  Yeah, at the event, all I gotta do is run up there
[05:50:51.630 --> 05:50:53.870]  and ask them and every single person that I've asked
[05:50:53.870 --> 05:50:57.510]  has said yes, so everyone's very receptive.
[05:50:57.510 --> 05:50:58.950]  We're batting a thousand with you.
[05:50:58.950 --> 05:51:00.870]  Batting a thousand, absolutely.
[05:51:00.870 --> 05:51:02.030]  I like it.
[05:51:02.030 --> 05:51:02.990]  All right.
[05:51:02.990 --> 05:51:03.830]  All right guys.
[05:51:03.830 --> 05:51:06.030]  Well, five hours and 50 minutes in,
[05:51:06.030 --> 05:51:08.470]  these guys, we're gonna unleash them.
[05:51:08.470 --> 05:51:09.310]  Animals, dude.
[05:51:10.750 --> 05:51:12.470]  It's doing the work.
[05:51:12.470 --> 05:51:13.750]  Couldn't do it without you, man.
[05:51:13.790 --> 05:51:15.550]  Couldn't do it without you, Peter.
[05:51:15.550 --> 05:51:17.670]  All right, well, see you guys.
[05:51:17.670 --> 05:51:22.670]  That's funny.
[05:51:22.670 --> 05:51:24.110]  Which one are you looking at?
[05:51:24.110 --> 05:51:26.070]  Oh, nothing, nothing.
[05:51:26.070 --> 05:51:28.150]  Just laughing at myself.
[05:51:28.150 --> 05:51:30.030]  Picking up sticks.
[05:51:30.030 --> 05:51:31.270]  Damn right, brother.
[05:51:31.270 --> 05:51:32.790]  Picking up sticks.
[05:51:32.790 --> 05:51:34.710]  You have to pronunciate.
[05:51:36.950 --> 05:51:37.790]  All right.
[05:51:37.790 --> 05:51:38.630]  All right.
[05:51:38.630 --> 05:51:40.750]  Have a good one, everyone.
[05:51:40.750 --> 05:51:43.190]  This is hopefully the last you'll see of me today.
[05:51:43.750 --> 05:51:47.350]  This is a long day ahead of me.
