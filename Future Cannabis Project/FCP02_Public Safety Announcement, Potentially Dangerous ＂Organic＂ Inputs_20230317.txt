How's it going Future Cannabis Project community? Lobster Fam Farms here today
with Josh from BioAg. We're gonna take a small pause and have a serious
conversation about some potentially dangerous organic inputs that we all may
be using or may have been using for a very long time and some of them may have
more danger associated with them than others, but I think awareness is
key. I know a lot of us, me included, think of our garden as like a little sacred
space, a little like you know mental commune if it's not a physical you know
hippie commune and we want to be safe in there you know if it's that type of
place information is power. So I'll leave it to Josh here. A couple things that I
was specifically curious on myself was boron and neem but I think Josh has a
couple things to go over so I'll leave it to you. Okay well most organic products that
are used in organic gardening can be broken down to four basic groups. Okay
you've got dead ground-up plants you know all your different meals you know
you've got dead ground-up animals and animal parts you know your bone meals
your blood meals your fish meals then you've got ground-up rocks ground-up
rock dust in all its many forms whether that's a mined linodite or whether
that's a azomite or a lime or any of those and then you've got animal waste
byproducts you know guanos, manures and all its forms and none of those things
are particularly good for you in their raw form and all pose their own
interesting problems so you got to be careful when you're handling any of them
you know you got to use common sense you got to wear gloves you got to wear some
sort of glasses and you got to wear some sort of a mask to make sure you're not
breathing that stuff in which is the most important thing particularly when
you're working with any sort of meals or guanos or manures you know compost is
just a another form that's a you know fermented you know any one of those or
all of those things in one big pile you know so they can make you just as sick
you know the ones that I personally come across that have been you want to be
particularly careful with are any boron supplements boron is a mineral that is
pretty much transdermal it can go through your skin very easy you know no
matter what form it's in whether that's an amino acid or you know a solubor or
any of these different boron supplements so you got to make sure that you wear
gloves and you use that stuff according to the directions and respect your
ingredients you don't know what you're working with before you work with it you
know do a little research that is worth its weight in gold you know knowing what
you're working with and you know and prepare your environment don't go off
and do anything haphazardly you know preparation is a very much an important
thing when you're doing anything with gardening when you're whether you're
working with organic or chemical fertilizer you know have everything set
up and ready to go don't don't do it willy-nilly you know but you know
certainly you know everyone knows you know common sense you don't want to be
eating or drinking you know or smoking while you're doing any of these things
but the specific products the you know either than boron that are I've had
problems with or like me personally I was working at a garden once and we were
top dressing with insect frass and I was not wearing a mask properly you know all
the way over my face and I got a bacterial lung infection from breathing
that stuff in and I got sicker than I've ever gotten you know and it's not fun
and you don't want to go through something like that and you certainly
don't want it to be your own fault when you do it so the other issue when you're
dealing with many of these products is they're often finely ground very dry
powders and those a lot of the time are inherently dangerous for fire so you got
to make sure that you keep your area clean after and before you're working
with any of this stuff you know whether you're working with perlite whether
you're working with a fine dolomite fine oyster shell you know any of these
new awesome micronized or nanostructure or a very fine ground-up powders that
are used for either top dressing or used to make compost ease those you got to be
very very careful with those are you know you can breathe them in easier and
you know if you leave them around you let powder build up that stuff can be
flammable you don't want that you know and it's best to keep everything clean
you don't want that stuff sticking around you know a clean garden is a
healthy garden but there are other things like neem is another one that
you got to be you know careful with you want to make sure that you're wearing
gloves yeah any any sort of meal that you work with whether it's plant-based
or not yeah sure alfalfa meals alfalfa meal and kelp meals kelp meal but those
are kind of the exceptions to the rule not the rule the rule is most about
combustibility of those which I just learned Josh like you know like yeah
well look at the you know go on YouTube and look at any sort of look up grain
silo fires you know all that that is is a fine organic powder you know that is
in the air floating around and catches a flame and boom you know it's one of the
biggest scariest things they deal with in those places when they're making
these powders yeah that's very interesting to me and the other thing
you want to make sure that you do when you're getting any of these things
particularly if you're growing cannabis is make sure that you know where it
comes from that you know it's a source you know you know there there's a lot of
different generic kelp meals and alfalfa meals and things like that and you don't
want to get something that's already been exposed to some sort of pesticide
or herbicide and then introduce that in your organic you know that's one of the
reasons I'm not a big fan of municipal compost or any compost that uses a yard
clippings you just don't know what's in there any other inputs you can think off
top of your head pretty much another ones I really like how you broke it down
into those four different sections I feel like that's very helpful yeah the
rock dusts you know there's a lot of different ground-up rock dusts that are
very high in different type not necessarily specific types they won't
have like more than let's say you know five parts per million of arsenic or any
of these other lead or any of these but when you take lead arsenic and you know
five six other of these micronutrient heavy metals aluminum copper you know
and then you've got them all in one powder and you're working with that
powder you better make sure that you you know be careful with it you know use it
according to its directions make sure that you have it in a sealed container a
lot of these things just come you know because they come from feed stores
especially in larger size bags which is the cheapest form to buy them in you
want to put that in a five gallon bucket with a nice sealed lid you don't want to
leave that stuff in a bag for it to float around your room you know that's
respecting your ingredients it's also making sure it's gonna keep much much
longer you know but you those are things you want to think ahead about
especially if you've got kids or if you've got pets you know particularly
pets pets are gonna be attracted to any one of these things you know dogs are
going to roll in it cats are gonna want to eat the fish meal you know you know
so you you want to make sure that you're careful with that my puppy tries to eat
most of the down-to-earth products I saw her nosing around one and then I knew
yeah whenever I like give her a chance she tries to go right in there so I just
bring them right out of her reach oh yeah my my mother's dog lives to
roll in my old used soil you know so I gotta keep that in containers away from
him now I can appreciate that personally and that's actually was gonna be my next
thing to bring up as someone that really loves to garden barefoot and barehanded
like you know I'm my best when my hands are in the soil I heard you bring up
some things earlier about splinters or just you know different organic
particulates getting in your under your skin essentially you know one of the
things that I noticed a reoccurring theme when I was working at the store
you know I worked there for 16 plus years is that about every couple you
know three four years a guy would come in and you know he'd be working with I
know any sort of good organic soil he'd get a couple splinters in his hand you
know he did come in with a band-aid and then come in with his finger wrapped you
know and then he'd come back a couple weeks after that with a story of all the
crazy antibiotics he had to get to cure the infection he had in his finger from
all the splinters you know because they were in that organic soil with all the
guanos and manures and you know and all that stuff's great you know when it
comes to feed your plant but you know you you don't want that to get in your
body in any fashion especially if you have you know a you know a cut or
something like that you know and a splinters a perfect way for that
bacteria to get into you and leave a nasty infection you know what you do not
want you know wearing you know wearing it's fun to play with soil you know but
you also gotta you know know what you're working with when you're doing it you
know it's a very big difference working with you know a soil that's heavy in
bark dust and has a lot of stuff in there that you know can stab you you
need to wear some some gloves to you know be safe especially if this is
something that you're doing on a more than regular basis you know another
thing that I wanted to address too was compost tees you know and making sure
that you clean your compost tea area your compost tea brewer you know and
sanitize you know there you know I know people again this was a reoccurring
theme at the store when particularly when organic stuff started to get big is
people making themselves sick you know with compost tea you know exposing
themselves to E.coli and other nasty diseases or nasty bacteria you know and
any compost tea that's older than 36 hours has a potential to have those
pathogens in it you know so be very very careful if you've got if you're brewing
teas for more than 24 hours you know know what's in there and make sure that
you're cleaning it up very very well make sure that you're wearing gloves
make sure that you're wearing goggles you don't want that stuff getting in
your eye you know make sure you're wearing a mask so you don't breathe it
in especially if it's being bubbled and aerated or especially if you're going to
foliar spray you know you know foliar spraying with organic matter I don't
care what it is you know you need to wear gloves you need to wear a mask if
you're spraying anything the Cal Meano was thick in the air in the garden this
morning when I was spraying it I almost could like feel it getting me and I was
just like hey you're almost done you know but it's remember it's going in
there once might be harmless you know it might not affect you at all but you're
gonna be doing this for a while you enjoy doing it you're gonna be doing it
on a regular basis don't hurt yourself
how about the guanos as well Josh is that something you wanted to touch on
any insight particularly you know you know another one that I've seen a lot of
people get very very sick of making and working with guano teas you know be
careful with what you're working with whether it comes from a bottle or
whether it's pre-made or whether you make it at home out of powders this
makes no difference it's all guano and you all you got to be careful with it it
could be as something as benign as worm castings sounds pretty harmless right
you know that a lot of the times you don't know what they made those worm
castings with they could have been made with horse manure they could have been
made with cow manure it could be a piece of that you know even though it's
still recycled through the worm and those are still very beneficial for your
plant that's not necessarily beneficial for you I think that's the great
overlying point right there Josh like worm castings it just sounds fuzzy and
warm and safe like like organic gardening did to me when I first was
introduced to it you know and it's dangerous stuff like mother nature's you
know the epitome of violence man will never be close to as dangerous or
violent as mother nature so I love how you put that that's like the overlying
thought I think here you know it's like worm castings like no one would
associate that with the skull and crossbones and maybe we shouldn't
necessarily day to day but potentially could hurt someone well and it's not
gonna hurt you you know you you know you know by tomorrow we're working with worm
castings you know or spraying with neem oil but if you do that on a regular
basis for 10 years you know what's gonna be the result of that you know
that's what you have been for four years I was soaked in that junk misty off
yeah you know we all did that at a point in time and you know get smarter with
age but you know definitely being proactive about you know your setup how
everything is making sure everything's in nice sealed containers you know
making sure that all your tools that you work with are clean making sure that
you use gloves on a regular basis and then you change them on a regular basis
one tip that I got from Tyler from grassroots the last bit I was setting up
was to wash off the lava rocks before I put them in and I could not believe the
amount of dust that was in the bucket after rinsing them it was hard like
where was all that dust gonna go either in the garden bed in the air and be like
there was so much of it so that was a great tip there too is simply just if
you have items like that that are inputs like even a lava rock I just give it a
little rinse here's one for the guys that aren't doing organics remember you
know I used to be a hydroponic guy and one of the things we worked with a lot
of hydroponic was your baked clay pellets hydroton or yeah yeah and man
that stuff comes with a crap load of dust on it and that's a clay dust that
is not good to breathe in you don't want to breathe that in you know just like if
you're mixing soil and you're working with something as benign as perlite
perlite's got a lot of you do not want to breathe that in that is one of the
last things you want to breathe in and after you've worked with it for a while
mixing soil you you all everyone knows that feeling when you've got it all over
your hands you know and you know it's kind of irritating but it's not you can
kind of taste it when you're when you're working that's not good you know that's
not good at all you know again if you're doing it you know twice a year probably
not gonna have a problem you're doing that three times a week because it's
your gig and what you do that is a goddamn problem you need to mind that
stuff you know pay attention to you know what you're doing and how often you're
doing it you know that's that's very very important you can make yourself
very very sick you know just by doing something which seems like it's harmless
but for a very very long time I feel I'm one of the biggest like abusers of lack
of knowledge and application because I've always romanticized gardening so
much since I was young and it brought me so much good in life it's hard to see
the other side of the coin where like maybe dipping my hands in reservoirs all
these all these times might not have been the smartest maybe like I should
have had some irrigation or were some gloves even though I was always like you
know I'd be the first to argue against it like you know I'm with the plants
like you know what they get I get whatever you know logic crazy dude logic
but yeah I feel like it's hard to see the danger when you romanticize this
life like a lot of us do like gardening such a great place and it's like it's
hard to look at it as pungi pits you know you catch a bamboo stake in the
neck you look at it different exactly you know I you know if you got a big cut
on your hand and you accidentally reaching that reservoir and there's
guano in there you're gonna know it the next day I guarantee it exactly prime
example you know one of the people that I learned so much about insecticides
fungicides and working with organic and inorganic materials was my friend Rick
Williams and he opened the store that I worked at for so long and he
unfortunately died very young of cancer you know yet he was a lifelong smoker
you know but at the same time you know you can't not point out the fact that
you know you know we we sprayed a lot of insecticides we mixed a lot of soils you
know we worked with a lot of hydroton you know we worked with a lot of stuff
and you know I don't know how much of that was damaging on top of us smoking
like chimneys at the time you know non-stop you know but you know I haven't
smoked a cigarette in many many years mostly because of that but you know it's
learning learning from the past and learning from your mistakes so you don't
repeat them and you know you don't you don't want to make yourself sick and
you sure as hell don't want to give yourself you know a major sickness
because you you know especially doing something that you love yeah maybe not
the worst way to go out but going out early is never ideal you know so it's
like I would be the first hardhead to argue about doing what you love why not
live to do it another 15 years longer if you love it that much you know exactly
exactly a lot of it boils down to just you know not letting this be routine and
you know making sure that you you know use common sense you know everyone knows
that when you're working with certain stuff if it smells bad you should be
wearing a mask you know if if it's in a garden you should probably be wearing
gloves you know if you're working with any sort of solution that you don't want
to drink chances are you want to be wearing glasses or something so you
don't get it in your eyes you know because you can hurt yourself you know
it could be as you know you know hydroponic guys are the worst when it
comes to pH up and down especially with how strong and potent the some of that
stuff you can buy at the store is these days holy crap you know I makes what we
work with look very very benign and harmless but but that doesn't mean what
we work with is benign and harmless you need to know what you're working with
and when you're working with it you know complacency will hurt you I think this is
a great insight and even just a different way to think you know and I'm
talking to myself as much as everyone else like I say you know it's like it's
never too late to recognize these things even if there's already a reversible
damage done you could always it always be better you know is be more informed
this is one of those universals that goes for all gardeners it doesn't matter
what you're growing you can hurt yourself growing pineapples just like you
can hurt yourself growing pop that makes no difference you know so
everybody's got to be careful with this stuff and there's plenty of people that
haven't been in the past where you can learn from their mistakes yeah that's
amazing Josh I truly appreciate it hope the community got some value from it
maybe it'll spark up some more conversations and maybe that could be
part of like you know regenerative 4.0 is using like you know stuff that
doesn't hurt you too much or something who knows where it could go or just good
it you can use there's lots of awesome stuff to use out there it's just using
it responsibly you know and making sure that you're not gonna hurt yourself or
anyone else in the process you know you're producing a product that other
people are gonna consume if you're not if you're not consuming it all yourself
there's responsibility you take there especially if it's your garden and it's
your significant other children or pets who have to suffer through it it's like
you know we're all hardheads you know a lot of cannabis gardeners you know oh
yeah remember everyone else it's not just the plants and you know it's like
you know it's a whole it's a whole ecosystem when you're spraying stuff in
the house or using inputs in the house dusty stuff yes wanna be safe out there
oh here's something Peter said I cut you off earlier sorry about that you were
making a point about it alfalfa being the exception to the rule yeah you know
a certain alfalfa meal is one of those things where you know that's one of the
very rare things I'll take a big old handful without wearing gloves and I'll
sprinkle some on my plants on a regular basis but that's kind of it even then
you know you want to be alfalfa meal is one of the ones that can be most exposed
to pesticides and herbicides so you want to know where you're getting it
from you know so getting it from a reputable source like down to earth or a
company that you know you can trust that works a lot with armory listed products
that are you know of high quality for edible products is important and that's
one that you said was potentially combustible as well the alfalfa so even
though it's like the only one safe to touch it might boom we're smoking a
cigarette you know and you certainly don't want to you know you know if
there's some that's in the air and it's floating around and you can see it you
know you're in a room full of lights most of the time when you're working
with this stuff you know or it's outside and it's real bright you you don't want
to risk a combustion it's an unlikely hood but it's still something that you
want to be careful about it's again it's is it something that's gonna happen
often no but it's something you need to be careful about you know even bakeries
and bakers got to be careful working with flour you know at a certain point
if it get if you got too much in the air and it's too you know it will combust I
just had another one on my mind I'm spacing now oh yeah STS what do you
think about seed soaks that's pretty generally harmless no because we would
drink that when you said like you wouldn't drink it like I would drink
some barley sprout tea you know again you know there's a there's exceptions to
the rule I was like is there anything I would just not glove it or not care I
was like I would drink some barley seeds but like that's that's pretty mellow
stuff baby food essentially essentially yeah you know and you know other
products you know that are relatively hard or a lot of like a lot of the pure
soy protein hydro slate you know that's pretty harmless as long as it's just
amino acids but again you want to be careful with it you still don't want to
get that stuff in a cup you know you still don't want to be breathing that
stuff in you know and a lot of the time they've got other micronutrients in with
it you know like we spoke a little bit earlier about boron supplements you know
the company I work for sells one called boramino which is a boron that's
complexed in an amino acid and you want to be you know just because it's an
amino acid doesn't you know and it is one of the least harmful and least hard
to overuse boron supplements on the market doesn't mean you you don't need
to be very very careful when you're using it you know make sure you wear
gloves make sure you wear a mask you know make sure that when you mix it into
water that you wear gloves before you touch that water. Here's one that Dirty
brought up and I think this is even something nowadays to be cautious I
can't remember if it was the EPA or what organization but someone said very
recently that all of the world's rainwater is non-potable because it's
you know that contaminated so I don't know too many facts about that but I
would speculate that maybe even rainwater is like dangerous now. It
depends it really very much depends on how it's collected where it's collected
from and this was the worldwide rainwater but as a general rule across
the the globe that would not surprise me you know not every place can yeah you
know I if there's a if you got if you're pumping oil anywhere near a place if you
got large you know petroleum by-product processing plants you know you're gonna
have a you know issues you can have a lot of issues you know when it comes to
that unfortunately. Pacific Northwest seems like a pretty solid buffer that
most of the earth doesn't have. Well here in the Pacific Northwest we're lacking the biggest thing that causes
pollution people. We've got less people that live in Oregon than live in the
Seattle area you know so because of that we've got less industry and because
we have less industry we have cleaner rainwater in places you know that's not
universal across the state you know but you know and with the weather patterns
patterns being unpredictable these days it's hard to say you know but it is
something that if you do use rainwater for anything you better be monitoring it
on a very regular basis you know what's in it you know EC you know and make sure
that you know with any rainwater collection it's all about cleaning your
equipment and keeping it clean you know clean those filters clean that barrel
you know wash out those reservoirs on a regular basis you know you especially if
you're if it's you're planning on keeping this water for any sort of
consumption basis. So here's a good question and this is one that we thought
was gonna be red flagged we did yes research and Josh found out that it was
a specific product I don't think we'll throw shade on any you know brands yeah
it's a specific formulation it's not the protein in general it seems that it's
safe to use which is good because I think it helps grow dank. Yeah here's the
the story there I was selling a product that had the harpene protein in at the
store and very much enjoyed it and very much enjoyed the way it worked I had a
very good success with it and selling it even though it wasn't the easiest
product to use. Then they started telling me the people that I was buying it from
that there was some sort of issue with it affecting people particularly
pregnant women or something along those lines and I've always assumed that that
was the the same case for long along this time but after doing some research
and looking it up according to the EPA I believe is who I looked it up they
said that they said that they've done studies with animals and that they
didn't find any significant amount of toxicity with residue from the harpene
protein so it's seems to be relatively harmless you know at least that's what
the internet says today you know but you know but always do your research but but
that's one that you know I was a very pleasantly surprised to hear is is safer
than it was because I always enjoyed using that product I am a very very big
fan of anything that triggers plants a natural immune system over using
something you know it's being proactive to a problem as opposed to being
reactive you know I'd rather make a stronger plant than spray when I got a
bum you know I'd rather have a plant that you can just deal with it and grow
through that problem before it becomes an infestation. A little harpene, a little
silica, a little calcium, you got little tanks. Yep. Well that's awesome do you
know if that product a specific one is still on market Josh or is it pretty
much safe to assume that anything that's on the market now is user friendly? I would assume
that anything on the market now would be relatively safe but make sure that you
read the labels and make sure that you do a little research on what it's for is
it for edible crops is it for ornamentals you know there's a very very
big difference between products that are meant for one as opposed to the other
you know and that's just a nasty insecticide for ornamentals only. Exactly you know and
you know a lot of systemic stuff that we want nothing to do with you know is just
meant for ornamental crops and that's you know nothing that we want any part
of. Now real quick we're getting close to 30 I don't know if this is in your
wheelhouse of expertise but what about all the modern stuff with like the
ferments and you know leaf molds and I know that's kind of a whole different
thing and that's super safe too but I'm sure there's dangers we're dealing with
like molds and funguses and geese and molds and I don't know. It's like anything when it
comes to when you're fermenting anything whether it's compost or whether it's
some of these Korean natural farming techniques where they're taking you know
different berries and stinging nettle and you're you're fermenting it and
you're getting a specific byproduct from that fermentation you know and I know a
lot of guys that do this and to great success I am a very big fan it's
something that I am new to but I am very very familiar with and I've seen
some amazing results using just for ferments as a source of NPK with
biostimulants in a living soil amazing results amazing but you know you got to
have a strong resistance to smells and and you got to be careful you know you
are rotting stuff you know you got to make sure that you know you keep your
you know you wear gloves you know just because it's organic does not mean it's
harmless. Battlesnake venom is organic. Exactly plutonium or uranium is organic.
That pretty much yeah that goes right there you know it's like yeah extreme
danger caution contains danger but it's all a balance you know mother nature
isn't just dangerous and violent she also gives us all this groovy stuff to
play with. That's another thing to talk on too you know everyone knows you know
if you're fermenting something at home you know obviously you want to be
careful with that you know but you know the big thing is is when you go to the
store and you buy it from a bottle that it can be just as dangerous that can be
you know if you're buying some of these uh you know we call them in the industry
bugs in a jug where it's got like 15 different bacillus in there and
mycorrhizae and all this stuff be careful with that you know don't go and
getting that on your hands don't go and you'll make sure that you're you know
washing your hands if you're working with this stuff I don't care if it's
mycorrhizae I don't care you know if it's a beneficial bacteria you know if
it's a powder you know it nitrogen fixing but it doesn't matter be careful
with that stuff don't get it on your skin if you do wash it off certainly
don't breathe it and certainly don't get it in your eyes or your mouth.
And that's definitely true because I have a couple bottles right now that are
like clearly so molded out around the rim and in the mix now where it's like I
have to throw it out or just wait till spring and just dump it in the yard but
you know organic bottles get dangerous too I open I was just like oh no easy.
There was one on here from Sapo too he was talking about the chitinase do you
have any insight on that into the chitin or chitinase as far as danger I'm a firm
believer in it as effective plant like you know foliar and seed in a root
trench but I don't know if there's any danger associated with it. I'm I haven't
heard I'm not a familiar with any danger associated with it but again I haven't
looked into it. Did you say you were friends with the people at title grow
is that you or no? Title grow? Maybe it was Nick at rooted leaves someone were
like oh yeah I know her she's cool but it'd be cool to get them on sometime as
well and talk about the chitinase. I don't think so. Anything else you could
think Josh or should we wrap this up? I think we covered it pretty much man I
you know respect your ingredients and make sure you do a little research you
know it can tell you stuff that you thought might have been harmful is not
you know or it can help you avoid a long-term damaging yourself or other
people. It's one thing to do something hurt yourself it's another thing to do
something and harm other people and if you're producing anything and giving it
to other people you take that responsibility and that's a big
responsibility. I've almost been looking at life a little strangely recently as
well where each day we're not quite the people we were earlier because things
change facts change the world is never static and Josh Peter and myself we all
just learned something new today and it's like tomorrow when I wake up it'll
be a new reset on what is the is. So I think like Josh is saying just do your
research be aware and like things change also you know it's like even just today
like learning is good and you know we can apply it. Stay on top of your game.
That's yeah straight G. All right guys we're gonna start up another one in a
couple minutes I'm gonna let the dog out real quick cuz she's screaming at me
I'll let Josh probably catch up on some emails and then we're gonna pop right
back in on here on the O2 and we're gonna do a second edition of the ideal
applications. I feel like we got a little carried away on the first episode as far
as foliar sprays and the full power which was good I think it was one of my
favorite episodes ever but maybe we could try to go a little bit on the root
trenches this time order of application and we'll see where the conversation
goes you never know but we'll be back in a couple minutes everyone hope
everyone enjoyed this I hope everyone stays safe and dangerous at the same
time remember mother nature she's dangerous so should us gardeners be but
safe in the same breath
