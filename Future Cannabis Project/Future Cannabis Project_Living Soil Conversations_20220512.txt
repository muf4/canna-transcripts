[00:01.530 --> 00:10.470]  we're live. We are. Boom Ken's
[00:10.470 --> 00:11.670]  on it- appreciate- Ken obviously
[00:11.670 --> 00:13.670]  it Peter behind the scenes-
[00:13.670 --> 00:15.810]  good morning to you living
[00:15.810 --> 00:16.810]  soil nerds- we've reached
[00:16.810 --> 00:18.850]  across- you know we're
[00:18.850 --> 00:19.850]  international obviously today-
[00:19.850 --> 00:21.850]  talking to an individual from
[00:21.850 --> 00:22.850]  the United Kingdom. You know
[00:22.850 --> 00:24.850]  there's a lot of- pros and cons
[00:24.850 --> 00:25.850]  with farming cannabis wherever
[00:25.850 --> 00:27.850]  you are- and one of those cons
[00:27.850 --> 00:29.850]  is- you know. There's certain
[00:29.850 --> 00:31.850]  things that you know- you know
[00:31.850 --> 00:32.850]  he's not gonna be showing his
[00:32.850 --> 00:33.850]  face today but he is gonna be
[00:33.850 --> 00:35.850]  dropping a lot of gold bars-
[00:35.850 --> 00:36.850]  it's somebody I'm excited to
[00:36.850 --> 00:38.850]  speak to just to kind of get a-
[00:38.850 --> 00:40.850]  an in depth. View on what's
[00:40.850 --> 00:41.850]  going on on the other side of
[00:41.850 --> 00:43.850]  the pond as they always say
[00:43.850 --> 00:44.850]  like. What what are your
[00:44.850 --> 00:46.850]  thoughts and philosophies and
[00:46.850 --> 00:47.850]  stuff when it comes to living
[00:47.850 --> 00:49.870]  soil what defines living soil
[00:49.870 --> 00:51.870]  so. I want to let my call
[00:51.870 --> 00:53.870]  cohost- Layton. Kind of chop it
[00:53.870 --> 00:54.870]  up with you and then I know
[00:54.870 --> 00:55.870]  that the community is going to
[00:55.870 --> 00:57.870]  love to. To pick your brain and
[00:57.890 --> 00:59.890]  to pick your mind. And so I
[00:59.890 --> 01:00.890]  want to let you know that we
[01:00.890 --> 01:01.890]  have a lot of people from the
[01:01.890 --> 01:03.890]  living soil side of things- that
[01:03.890 --> 01:05.890]  we might not necessarily heard
[01:05.890 --> 01:06.890]  of because I feel like from the
[01:06.890 --> 01:07.890]  living side of things of the
[01:07.890 --> 01:08.890]  United States. Are we've gone
[01:08.890 --> 01:10.890]  out our way to try to pick. The
[01:10.890 --> 01:16.080]  best and brightest minds. And
[01:16.080 --> 01:17.080]  today we're bringing you one
[01:17.080 --> 01:19.080]  from the United Kingdom. Well
[01:19.080 --> 01:22.080]  good. What's what time is it
[01:22.080 --> 01:26.100]  over there. It is six o'clock.
[01:26.100 --> 01:28.100]  Okay so it's not too out of
[01:28.140 --> 01:29.140]  the way. So how long have you
[01:29.140 --> 01:32.140]  been growing cannabis my friend.
[01:32.140 --> 01:33.140]  Well probably for around twenty
[01:33.140 --> 01:35.140]  years now. All right so let's
[01:35.140 --> 01:36.140]  start with your journey. Why
[01:36.140 --> 01:38.140]  don't you just- let us know how
[01:38.140 --> 01:40.140]  you got into it and- your
[01:40.140 --> 01:42.140]  growing technique and- once of
[01:42.140 --> 01:45.160]  all. So the reason the primary
[01:45.160 --> 01:46.160]  reason why I grow cannabis is I
[01:46.160 --> 01:48.160]  have Tourette's I have ADHD
[01:48.160 --> 01:50.160]  interests and I've smoked now
[01:50.160 --> 01:51.160]  before this video if I hadn't
[01:51.160 --> 01:52.160]  done I probably wouldn't be able
[01:52.160 --> 01:53.160]  to string a word together
[01:53.160 --> 01:56.160]  because- it gets really bad-
[01:56.220 --> 01:58.220]  like noises and sniffing and not
[01:58.220 --> 02:00.220]  being able to get my words out
[02:00.220 --> 02:02.220]  and- I don't really swear so
[02:02.220 --> 02:04.240]  much but- yes I have Tourette's
[02:04.240 --> 02:06.240]  so everyone's probably familiar
[02:06.240 --> 02:08.240]  with what Tourette's is. And the
[02:08.240 --> 02:10.240]  reason why I started growing was
[02:10.240 --> 02:12.240]  because it's the only thing that
[02:12.240 --> 02:15.240]  alleviates- my condition so that
[02:15.240 --> 02:17.240]  was my primary reason for
[02:17.240 --> 02:18.240]  starting to grow starting to
[02:18.240 --> 02:23.240]  grow cannabis. Did you find this
[02:23.240 --> 02:25.240]  out on your own or like. When I
[02:25.340 --> 02:27.340]  was younger I was diagnosed with
[02:27.340 --> 02:30.340]  ADHD. My family thought that-
[02:30.340 --> 02:32.340]  like Ritalin Adderall dexedrine
[02:32.340 --> 02:35.340]  like those are the answers. So
[02:35.340 --> 02:36.340]  what's your family kind of
[02:36.340 --> 02:37.340]  pushing pharmaceuticals on you
[02:37.340 --> 02:38.340]  as well and you went down this
[02:38.340 --> 02:40.340]  own path on your own or- yeah
[02:40.340 --> 02:42.340]  like when I was young I was
[02:42.340 --> 02:44.340]  given Ritalin for a few weeks
[02:44.340 --> 02:46.360]  but it you know put me into a
[02:46.360 --> 02:47.360]  state that my parents weren't
[02:47.360 --> 02:49.360]  happy seeing me in what it done
[02:49.360 --> 02:51.360]  to me so it only lasted for a
[02:51.360 --> 02:52.360]  few weeks or so and then my mom
[02:52.360 --> 02:54.360]  said. You know he's not taking
[02:54.480 --> 02:56.480]  it because the side effects are
[02:56.480 --> 02:58.480]  you know- really depilitating
[02:58.480 --> 03:00.480]  and it was painful to her for
[03:00.480 --> 03:01.480]  her to watch what he was doing
[03:01.480 --> 03:04.480]  to me. And then I sort of just
[03:04.480 --> 03:07.480]  had to suffer. The Tourette's
[03:07.480 --> 03:09.480]  and the ADHD up until my
[03:09.480 --> 03:11.480]  earlier adolescence and then
[03:11.480 --> 03:13.480]  along came marijuana and most
[03:13.480 --> 03:14.480]  people around you know forty
[03:14.480 --> 03:16.480]  fifteen sixteen they'll smoke a
[03:16.480 --> 03:18.480]  cigarette or some weed. And
[03:18.480 --> 03:20.480]  then I smoked some weed and then
[03:20.480 --> 03:22.480]  my Tourette's stopped and I was
[03:22.480 --> 03:23.480]  like oh my god I'm not doing
[03:23.600 --> 03:25.600]  Tourette's anymore. My parents
[03:25.600 --> 03:27.600]  split up when I was younger so I
[03:27.600 --> 03:29.600]  only lived with one of them and
[03:29.600 --> 03:31.600]  they were like overjoyed really
[03:31.600 --> 03:33.600]  because the stigma behind
[03:33.600 --> 03:35.600]  marijuana as it being a gateway
[03:35.600 --> 03:38.600]  drug that leads into X, Y and Z
[03:38.600 --> 03:41.600]  was the mindset of the majority
[03:41.600 --> 03:44.600]  of people in like the early
[03:44.600 --> 03:47.600]  nineties. So when I smoked it
[03:47.600 --> 03:49.600]  and you know my Tourette's had
[03:49.600 --> 03:51.600]  stopped and my behavior was much
[03:51.720 --> 03:53.720]  better and I was much more calm
[03:53.720 --> 03:55.720]  and that it was a saving grace
[03:55.720 --> 03:57.720]  so my parents were like straight
[03:57.720 --> 03:59.720]  away they were like well if this
[03:59.720 --> 04:00.720]  stuff is helping you man we've
[04:00.720 --> 04:02.720]  you know cried our eyes out you
[04:02.720 --> 04:04.720]  know watching you being
[04:04.720 --> 04:05.720]  in complete and utter distress
[04:05.720 --> 04:07.720]  for all these years and now
[04:07.720 --> 04:10.720]  you're not so yeah it was a
[04:10.720 --> 04:13.720]  saving grace. You know it's
[04:13.720 --> 04:15.720]  funny I noticed that a lot of
[04:15.720 --> 04:18.720]  Europeans like to roll their
[04:18.720 --> 04:20.720]  cannabis along with the
[04:20.840 --> 04:23.840]  cannabis and hash too. Do you
[04:23.840 --> 04:26.840]  find that that is a some kind of
[04:26.840 --> 04:28.840]  different effect than just
[04:28.840 --> 04:31.840]  regular joints?
[04:31.840 --> 04:33.840]  Well I primarily just smoke
[04:33.840 --> 04:36.840]  quite high CBD concentrate
[04:36.840 --> 04:39.840]  cannabis and low THC because I
[04:39.840 --> 04:40.840]  found that that's been the best
[04:40.840 --> 04:42.840]  for me because I'm not really
[04:42.840 --> 04:44.840]  one to take drugs and escape for
[04:44.840 --> 04:45.840]  the reason of escaping life.
[04:45.840 --> 04:46.840]  People will drink alcohol or
[04:46.840 --> 04:49.840]  smoke cigarettes or cannabis
[04:49.960 --> 04:50.960]  because they don't have a
[04:50.960 --> 04:51.960]  legitimate medicinal reason
[04:51.960 --> 04:53.960]  behind it. It's just a form of
[04:53.960 --> 04:55.960]  escapism you know and everyone
[04:55.960 --> 04:56.960]  can do that with perfect
[04:56.960 --> 04:58.960]  utility you know I'm not here to
[04:58.960 --> 05:00.960]  judge people but then there are
[05:00.960 --> 05:04.960]  people that need cannabis for
[05:04.960 --> 05:06.960]  medicinal purposes so my reason
[05:06.960 --> 05:08.960]  isn't really to get high and get
[05:08.960 --> 05:11.960]  wasted and you know escape my
[05:11.960 --> 05:14.960]  reality as it is. My primary
[05:14.960 --> 05:15.960]  reason was just so I could live
[05:16.080 --> 05:19.080]  a normal life and have the
[05:19.080 --> 05:21.080]  effects of the Tourette's
[05:21.080 --> 05:24.080]  subdued because you know if one
[05:24.080 --> 05:26.080]  time maybe I do a video where I
[05:26.080 --> 05:27.080]  don't smoke anything and I think
[05:27.080 --> 05:29.080]  a lot of people probably cry
[05:29.080 --> 05:30.080]  because it's such a horrible
[05:30.080 --> 05:32.080]  thing. It's so severe sometimes
[05:32.080 --> 05:33.080]  especially if I'm under stress
[05:33.080 --> 05:36.080]  like if I don't eat or got like
[05:36.080 --> 05:37.080]  worries or anxieties about
[05:37.080 --> 05:39.080]  things it just exasperates it
[05:39.080 --> 05:40.080]  out of control and I'll
[05:40.080 --> 05:42.080]  convulsions and flicking and
[05:42.080 --> 05:44.080]  moving and throwing things on my
[05:44.200 --> 05:47.200]  head and can't you know wouldn't
[05:47.200 --> 05:48.200]  be able to drive a car or just
[05:48.200 --> 05:49.200]  do anything normally function
[05:49.200 --> 05:52.200]  normally because they're
[05:52.200 --> 05:55.200]  uncontrollable so yeah my reason
[05:55.200 --> 05:56.200]  was just to smoke it for that
[05:56.200 --> 05:58.200]  and I wanted to like take myself
[05:58.200 --> 06:00.200]  away from the high getting high
[06:00.200 --> 06:02.200]  all the time because the
[06:02.200 --> 06:05.200]  psychoactive part of you know
[06:05.200 --> 06:07.200]  not being able to feel
[06:07.200 --> 06:09.200]  completely normal that's not
[06:09.200 --> 06:10.200]  what I wanted I just wanted my
[06:10.200 --> 06:12.200]  Tourette's to stop you know so I
[06:12.320 --> 06:14.320]  was trying different strains
[06:14.320 --> 06:17.320]  that were not really getting me
[06:17.320 --> 06:20.320]  that high but we're just taking
[06:20.320 --> 06:21.320]  away the Tourette's so that's
[06:21.320 --> 06:23.320]  what I usually grow and smoke
[06:23.320 --> 06:24.320]  now.
[06:26.320 --> 06:27.320]  When did you first get
[06:27.320 --> 06:29.320]  introduced to CBD? From my
[06:29.320 --> 06:31.320]  understanding it really wasn't
[06:31.320 --> 06:34.320]  pushed in the cultivar production
[06:34.320 --> 06:37.320]  till I think it was like
[06:37.320 --> 06:38.320]  2000s right?
[06:38.440 --> 06:41.440]  Yeah so like that's you know
[06:41.440 --> 06:44.440]  almost 22 years ago so the stage
[06:44.440 --> 06:47.440]  where I was was smoking they were
[06:47.440 --> 06:49.440]  up and coming but not there was
[06:49.440 --> 06:50.440]  no that we didn't have the
[06:50.440 --> 06:51.440]  internet for a start so the
[06:51.440 --> 06:54.440]  research into what was beneficial
[06:54.440 --> 06:55.440]  and what wasn't wasn't really
[06:55.440 --> 06:58.440]  there and it was mainly just a lot
[06:58.440 --> 07:00.440]  of old Dutch strains there was
[07:00.440 --> 07:02.440]  only regular seeds there wasn't
[07:02.440 --> 07:03.440]  even really feminized seeds when
[07:03.440 --> 07:05.440]  I first started so I'd have to
[07:05.440 --> 07:07.440]  sex the plants and I'd have to
[07:07.560 --> 07:09.560]  sex the plant and it was just
[07:09.560 --> 07:12.560]  trial and error really to just
[07:12.560 --> 07:14.560]  experiment with different plants
[07:14.560 --> 07:16.560]  I used to smoke one which was the
[07:16.560 --> 07:18.560]  hash plant and it only had about
[07:18.560 --> 07:22.560]  10% THC and around 6 or 7% CBD
[07:24.560 --> 07:25.560]  so that was one I used to grow
[07:25.560 --> 07:26.560]  for a long time and then as time
[07:26.560 --> 07:28.560]  went on and there was more
[07:28.560 --> 07:30.560]  knowledge and research and
[07:30.560 --> 07:32.560]  specific breeders were breeding
[07:32.560 --> 07:35.560]  CBD rich strains only it just
[07:35.680 --> 07:38.680]  gives me a wider variety of stuff
[07:38.680 --> 07:39.680]  to smoke I'm growing first
[07:39.680 --> 07:40.680]  generation extra cheese at the
[07:40.680 --> 07:42.680]  moment and the THC on it
[07:42.680 --> 07:44.680]  surprisingly isn't that high it's
[07:44.680 --> 07:46.680]  usually in the realms of like 15
[07:46.680 --> 07:48.680]  to 20% and I'm not sure even what
[07:48.680 --> 07:52.680]  the CBD content is with it it's
[07:52.680 --> 07:54.680]  not that high but even though it's
[07:54.680 --> 07:55.680]  not CBD rich strain this
[07:55.680 --> 07:57.680]  particular strain it works really
[07:57.680 --> 07:59.680]  well for me and it doesn't really
[07:59.680 --> 08:01.680]  like get me that that high like
[08:01.680 --> 08:04.680]  it's not sativa racian and it's
[08:04.800 --> 08:06.800]  not couch lock indigo it's just
[08:06.800 --> 08:08.800]  like a mix which works well for
[08:08.800 --> 08:10.800]  me so that's just one that I like
[08:10.800 --> 08:13.800]  to grow because it does the job
[08:14.800 --> 08:16.800]  I have some questions obviously
[08:16.800 --> 08:17.800]  for you Dr. Organics and I kind
[08:17.800 --> 08:19.800]  of wanted to get into more of like
[08:19.800 --> 08:21.800]  the genetics so what would you say
[08:21.800 --> 08:23.800]  like the knowledge level is
[08:23.800 --> 08:26.800]  where at is genetics understood
[08:26.800 --> 08:28.800]  that you know you're especially
[08:28.800 --> 08:29.800]  from a living soil side of things
[08:29.800 --> 08:32.800]  are you you guys as a whole
[08:32.920 --> 08:34.920]  understanding that that's that's
[08:34.920 --> 08:36.920]  how at least in the States we're
[08:36.920 --> 08:38.920]  able to achieve kind of full
[08:38.920 --> 08:40.920]  genetic profile of the cannabis
[08:40.920 --> 08:42.920]  plants or is that more like in a
[08:42.920 --> 08:44.920]  smaller circle that you run
[08:44.920 --> 08:46.920]  well I'd say that are the UK
[08:46.920 --> 08:48.920]  understanding some of the greatest
[08:48.920 --> 08:50.920]  strains that you know if you have
[08:50.920 --> 08:52.920]  a I don't know what if you're
[08:52.920 --> 08:53.920]  familiar with some strains that
[08:53.920 --> 08:55.920]  are present but first generation
[08:55.920 --> 08:57.920]  exodus cheese was a phenotype from
[08:57.920 --> 08:58.920]  skunk number one that was
[08:58.920 --> 09:00.920]  perpetuated by the exodus true
[09:01.040 --> 09:03.040]  Exodus crew which were
[09:04.040 --> 09:06.040]  hydroponic flood and drain NFT
[09:07.040 --> 09:09.040]  producers and they got hold of
[09:09.040 --> 09:11.040]  this phenotype and they've used
[09:11.040 --> 09:13.040]  different techniques to preserve
[09:13.040 --> 09:15.040]  the genetics of it over the years
[09:15.040 --> 09:17.040]  without it breaking down and
[09:17.040 --> 09:19.040]  having to throw it away and be
[09:19.040 --> 09:21.040]  lost so I think like the
[09:21.040 --> 09:23.040]  understanding of the genetic
[09:23.040 --> 09:25.040]  components maybe the guys in the
[09:25.040 --> 09:26.040]  States think because it's legal
[09:26.040 --> 09:30.040]  in the States and it's more
[09:30.160 --> 09:32.160]  spoken about and accepted and
[09:32.160 --> 09:34.160]  they don't have to worry about
[09:34.160 --> 09:36.160]  the legality so much I know that
[09:36.160 --> 09:38.160]  on a federal level is illegal but
[09:38.160 --> 09:39.160]  in state level is not but you
[09:39.160 --> 09:40.160]  know people can sort of do what
[09:40.160 --> 09:42.160]  they want to do but some of the
[09:42.160 --> 09:44.160]  greatest strains and greatest
[09:44.160 --> 09:45.160]  breeders being so close to
[09:45.160 --> 09:47.160]  Holland as well has come out of
[09:47.160 --> 09:49.160]  the UK whether it's been like the
[09:49.160 --> 09:51.160]  the El Chapo or the first
[09:51.160 --> 09:53.160]  generation exodus cheese or some
[09:53.160 --> 09:55.160]  of the lemon amnesias the bubble
[09:55.160 --> 09:58.160]  gum there were a lot of phenotypes
[09:58.280 --> 10:03.280]  that were germinated from like
[10:03.280 --> 10:06.280]  Dutch breeders and then were
[10:06.280 --> 10:09.280]  very present on the UK scene you
[10:09.280 --> 10:13.280]  know so the UK cultivation scene
[10:13.280 --> 10:15.280]  is absolutely massive like we
[10:15.280 --> 10:17.280]  consume more cocaine and more
[10:17.280 --> 10:18.280]  cannabis than the rest of Europe
[10:18.280 --> 10:20.280]  put together and we grow more
[10:20.280 --> 10:22.280]  cannabis than the rest of Europe
[10:22.280 --> 10:24.280]  and even our we've even got legal
[10:24.280 --> 10:27.280]  facilities in the United Kingdom
[10:27.400 --> 10:29.400]  which actually supplies about 40%
[10:29.400 --> 10:31.400]  of the medicinal marijuana that's
[10:31.400 --> 10:33.400]  consumed without Europe Holland
[10:33.400 --> 10:35.400]  and Canada so like England's been
[10:35.400 --> 10:37.400]  doing it for a long time it's a
[10:37.400 --> 10:39.400]  little bit hypocritical that they
[10:39.400 --> 10:42.400]  demonize people for it not so much
[10:42.400 --> 10:44.400]  now because it's more accepted and
[10:44.400 --> 10:47.400]  the the mayor of London is allowed
[10:47.400 --> 10:49.400]  it to be smoked recreationally in
[10:49.400 --> 10:51.400]  certain parts of London but like
[10:51.400 --> 10:54.400]  the the level of growing in the
[10:54.400 --> 10:56.400]  United Kingdom is probably second
[10:56.520 --> 10:57.520]  to none like we don't have the
[10:57.520 --> 10:58.520]  weather so the majority of it's
[10:58.520 --> 11:00.520]  been done inside but we've been
[11:00.520 --> 11:02.520]  doing this for a long long time
[11:02.520 --> 11:05.520]  like and people are very I
[11:05.520 --> 11:07.520]  wouldn't say hobbyist growers are
[11:07.520 --> 11:10.520]  really too aware of of genetics so
[11:10.520 --> 11:13.520]  much and the breeding programs are
[11:13.520 --> 11:15.520]  a little bit cloak and dagger but
[11:15.520 --> 11:16.520]  like we've got some really good
[11:16.520 --> 11:18.520]  breeders in the UK that create
[11:18.520 --> 11:20.520]  some you know phenomenal strains
[11:20.520 --> 11:24.520]  absolutely I mean one of them
[11:24.640 --> 11:26.640]  even one ourself we've got our own
[11:26.640 --> 11:29.640]  one that is called lemon meringue
[11:29.640 --> 11:32.640]  pies across of a lemon ammy super
[11:32.640 --> 11:37.640]  silver lemon skunk lemon cake and
[11:37.640 --> 11:40.640]  yeah it's a one that we bred
[11:40.640 --> 11:41.640]  ourselves it took a few years and
[11:41.640 --> 11:44.640]  it's a highly yield high yield in
[11:44.640 --> 11:47.640]  highly potent you know dripping in
[11:47.640 --> 11:49.640]  resin a highly productive plant
[11:49.640 --> 11:52.640]  that's the only one that we've done
[11:52.760 --> 11:54.760]  because the breeding program takes
[11:54.760 --> 11:55.760]  a long time to do something instead
[11:55.760 --> 11:57.760]  of just you know reversing things you
[11:57.760 --> 11:59.760]  get a good feeder and in reverse as
[11:59.760 --> 12:01.760]  most people do and then get a load of
[12:01.760 --> 12:04.760]  regular seeds and or fit feminized
[12:04.760 --> 12:06.760]  seeds and try and you know make some
[12:06.760 --> 12:07.760]  money out of it we've done a proper
[12:07.760 --> 12:09.760]  breeding program with this particular
[12:09.760 --> 12:15.100]  one yeah I was the UK cheese was one
[12:15.100 --> 12:17.100]  of the like standouts I feel like
[12:17.100 --> 12:19.100]  here in Denver Colorado and that was
[12:19.100 --> 12:22.100]  definitely from that side of things
[12:22.220 --> 12:24.220]  when we were learning how to grow and
[12:24.220 --> 12:26.220]  learning from more of like the European
[12:26.220 --> 12:28.220]  side it seemed like that was all
[12:28.220 --> 12:32.220]  hyponics is it continuing to stay that
[12:32.220 --> 12:34.220]  way that's why I reached out to you
[12:34.220 --> 12:36.220]  sirs because it seems like you're
[12:36.220 --> 12:37.220]  you're on the forefront of something
[12:37.220 --> 12:40.220]  that I don't maybe because it is the
[12:40.220 --> 12:42.220]  laws that you don't see that as much on
[12:42.220 --> 12:43.220]  Instagram but you're one of the few
[12:43.220 --> 12:45.220]  people I've seen in the United Kingdom
[12:45.220 --> 12:47.220]  growing living soil with even I mean I
[12:47.220 --> 12:49.220]  can see it right there with the praying
[12:49.220 --> 12:50.220]  leaves and seems like you really
[12:50.340 --> 12:52.340]  understand the system itself it's a
[12:52.340 --> 12:56.340]  shame really because the reason why the
[12:56.340 --> 13:00.340]  basically in the United Kingdom you can
[13:00.340 --> 13:02.340]  sell anything cannabis affiliate so you
[13:02.340 --> 13:04.340]  can sell LED light in high-pressure
[13:04.340 --> 13:09.340]  sodium CFLs extraction global air
[13:09.340 --> 13:11.340]  supplies like the industry is big it's
[13:11.340 --> 13:13.340]  worth millions and millions of pounds
[13:13.340 --> 13:16.340]  soil nutrients Dutch pro whoever it may
[13:16.340 --> 13:18.340]  be there's hydroponics in the UK
[13:18.460 --> 13:21.460]  there's hydroponic shops all around the
[13:21.460 --> 13:24.460]  UK from like Scotland to Cornwall you
[13:24.460 --> 13:28.460]  can go in there and buy seeds there's
[13:28.460 --> 13:30.460]  just legalities behind the seeds where
[13:30.460 --> 13:32.460]  on the packets of seeds it will say
[13:34.460 --> 13:36.460]  these are not to be germinated for
[13:36.460 --> 13:38.460]  souvenir purposes only so the
[13:38.460 --> 13:39.460]  government are fully aware of what's
[13:39.460 --> 13:41.460]  going on but instead of losing millions
[13:41.460 --> 13:43.460]  of pounds worth of tax money from
[13:43.460 --> 13:45.460]  growers buying stuff and having it
[13:45.460 --> 13:47.460]  shipped in they've just constructed
[13:47.580 --> 13:49.580]  a framework to cover themselves and say
[13:49.580 --> 13:51.580]  you know you can sell seeds you can
[13:51.580 --> 13:53.580]  sell the light and you can do
[13:53.580 --> 13:55.580]  everything who's to say that you're not
[13:55.580 --> 13:57.580]  going to grow tomatoes in a tent under
[13:57.580 --> 13:59.580]  a high-pressure sodium like there's
[13:59.580 --> 14:01.580]  nothing illegal about growing any other
[14:01.580 --> 14:03.580]  plants bar
[14:03.580 --> 14:05.580]  cannabis it's either or even hemp funny
[14:05.580 --> 14:07.580]  enough you still need to license from
[14:07.580 --> 14:09.580]  the Home Office for that so you know
[14:09.580 --> 14:11.580]  there's hundreds of thousands of
[14:11.580 --> 14:13.580]  hobbyists like you you know everyone's
[14:13.580 --> 14:15.580]  smoking weed you go down the road
[14:15.700 --> 14:17.700]  everyone's smoking it everyone's growing
[14:17.700 --> 14:19.700]  it like it's a massive massive thing
[14:19.700 --> 14:21.700]  in the UK and the
[14:21.700 --> 14:23.700]  reason why it's
[14:23.700 --> 14:25.700]  been
[14:25.700 --> 14:27.700]  primarily
[14:27.700 --> 14:29.700]  nutrient companies that have taken a
[14:29.700 --> 14:31.700]  stronghold is because there's vast
[14:31.700 --> 14:33.700]  amounts of money to be made from
[14:33.700 --> 14:35.700]  selling bottled nutrients that
[14:35.700 --> 14:37.700]  are 99% soluble
[14:37.700 --> 14:39.700]  NPK
[14:39.700 --> 14:41.700]  1% soluble NPK
[14:41.700 --> 14:43.700]  sorry 99% water the most
[14:43.820 --> 14:45.820]  expensive thing
[14:45.820 --> 14:47.820]  is the bottle and the label
[14:47.820 --> 14:49.820]  the soluble nitrogen potassium
[14:49.820 --> 14:51.820]  and phosphorus trace elements and vitamins
[14:51.820 --> 14:53.820]  that they put inside cost absolute peanuts
[14:53.820 --> 14:55.820]  so it's an extremely
[14:55.820 --> 14:57.820]  profitable
[14:57.820 --> 14:59.820]  industry to be in and it's
[14:59.820 --> 15:01.820]  very deceptive and what one of my
[15:01.820 --> 15:03.820]  reasons why I do this
[15:03.820 --> 15:05.820]  organic living soil is obviously I want
[15:05.820 --> 15:07.820]  people to grow
[15:07.820 --> 15:09.820]  organic
[15:09.820 --> 15:11.820]  good quality marijuana
[15:11.940 --> 15:13.940]  but also people
[15:13.940 --> 15:15.940]  are of the understanding that in order
[15:15.940 --> 15:17.940]  to grow a good plant that they
[15:17.940 --> 15:19.940]  need to use
[15:19.940 --> 15:21.940]  all these different bottles and whether it's
[15:21.940 --> 15:23.940]  calcium, magnesium, grow A, grow B
[15:23.940 --> 15:25.940]  super sticky silica
[15:25.940 --> 15:27.940]  and having to add a milliliter
[15:27.940 --> 15:29.940]  per liter of water at all
[15:29.940 --> 15:31.940]  different stages of the plant's growth to
[15:31.940 --> 15:33.940]  prevent deficiencies and you know
[15:33.940 --> 15:35.940]  these nutrient companies have
[15:35.940 --> 15:37.940]  perpetuated the lie that living soil
[15:37.940 --> 15:39.940]  is inferior there's a lesser
[15:40.060 --> 15:42.060]  yield
[15:42.060 --> 15:44.060]  when the matter of the fact is
[15:44.060 --> 15:46.060]  it's actually a superior yield a better
[15:46.060 --> 15:48.060]  growth rate an overall
[15:48.060 --> 15:50.060]  final better product better flavour
[15:50.060 --> 15:52.060]  better terpene production
[15:52.060 --> 15:54.060]  when it's done right and
[15:54.060 --> 15:56.060]  it's eco-friendly, reusable
[15:58.060 --> 16:00.060]  there's no waste it's
[16:00.060 --> 16:02.060]  extremely efficient but there's no money
[16:02.060 --> 16:04.060]  in it for companies to sell
[16:04.060 --> 16:06.060]  a bag of soil that somebody
[16:06.060 --> 16:08.060]  only buys once and then
[16:08.180 --> 16:10.180]  uses a handful of dry amendment
[16:10.180 --> 16:12.180]  to re-amend the soil and then they can carry
[16:12.180 --> 16:14.180]  on growing on their next harvest
[16:14.180 --> 16:16.180]  there's vast amounts of money
[16:16.180 --> 16:18.180]  to be made from selling people
[16:18.180 --> 16:20.180]  this is the typical
[16:20.180 --> 16:22.180]  set out in the United
[16:22.180 --> 16:24.180]  Kingdom you've got a hobbyist they've got like a
[16:24.180 --> 16:26.180]  1.2 by 1.2 meter grow tent
[16:26.180 --> 16:28.180]  for example
[16:28.180 --> 16:30.180]  and they'll say to use
[16:30.180 --> 16:32.180]  9-15
[16:32.180 --> 16:34.180]  liter pots and use the
[16:34.180 --> 16:36.180]  full range of whatever nutrient you choose
[16:36.300 --> 16:38.300]  Dutch Probe or Psychonutrients
[16:38.300 --> 16:40.300]  or even Organic Biobase
[16:40.300 --> 16:42.300]  for instance and they've extrapolated
[16:42.300 --> 16:44.300]  all the different
[16:44.300 --> 16:46.300]  beneficials, nitrogen, potassium,
[16:46.300 --> 16:48.300]  phosphorus that the plant needs
[16:48.300 --> 16:50.300]  to make you buy a bottle of
[16:50.300 --> 16:52.300]  Grow, a bottle of Bloom, a bottle
[16:52.300 --> 16:54.300]  of Topmax, a bottle of Fishmix
[16:54.300 --> 16:56.300]  a bottle of Algamic, a bottle of Calcium
[16:56.300 --> 16:58.300]  a bottle of Calcium
[16:58.300 --> 17:00.300]  Magnesium, pH Down
[17:00.300 --> 17:02.300]  all these different bottles
[17:02.300 --> 17:04.300]  microbes and it's just
[17:04.420 --> 17:06.420]  a complete farce, it's a complete con
[17:06.420 --> 17:08.420]  and the only reason why they've gotten away
[17:08.420 --> 17:10.420]  with it is because growing
[17:10.420 --> 17:12.420]  cannabis in the UK is illegal
[17:12.420 --> 17:14.420]  you don't go into any of the nurseries or any
[17:14.420 --> 17:16.420]  of the garden shops and you have to buy a hundred
[17:16.420 --> 17:18.420]  different bottles to grow a tomato
[17:18.420 --> 17:20.420]  or tomato as you guys say
[17:20.420 --> 17:22.420]  or your cabbages or whatever else
[17:22.420 --> 17:24.420]  it's only in the cannabis cultivation
[17:24.420 --> 17:26.420]  industry that people think
[17:26.420 --> 17:28.420]  that they need all these different nutrients
[17:28.420 --> 17:30.420]  and all these different
[17:30.420 --> 17:32.420]  vitamins and amino acids
[17:32.540 --> 17:34.540]  to achieve
[17:34.540 --> 17:36.540]  a good yield and get
[17:36.540 --> 17:38.540]  a good plant
[17:38.540 --> 17:40.540]  and very little
[17:40.540 --> 17:42.540]  time has been
[17:42.540 --> 17:44.540]  talked about perfecting your
[17:44.540 --> 17:46.540]  environment, your air flow, maintaining
[17:46.540 --> 17:48.540]  humidity, temperature
[17:48.540 --> 17:50.540]  getting good genetics
[17:50.540 --> 17:52.540]  you know, you can't grow
[17:52.540 --> 17:54.540]  shit genetics and make them good no matter
[17:54.540 --> 17:56.540]  what you grow them in and then having
[17:56.540 --> 17:58.540]  a good organic living soil
[17:58.540 --> 18:00.540]  that delivers
[18:00.660 --> 18:02.660]  a consistent level
[18:02.660 --> 18:04.660]  of nutrients to the plant
[18:04.660 --> 18:06.660]  throughout its entire life
[18:06.660 --> 18:08.660]  letting it fade
[18:08.660 --> 18:10.660]  and the plant
[18:10.660 --> 18:12.660]  utilizing the nutrients and vitamins
[18:12.660 --> 18:14.660]  that are stored in the upper canopy
[18:14.660 --> 18:16.660]  I explain to people
[18:16.660 --> 18:18.660]  in a lot of videos that these fertiliser
[18:18.660 --> 18:20.660]  companies are asking people to use massive
[18:20.660 --> 18:22.660]  amounts of
[18:22.660 --> 18:24.660]  massive amounts of PK in the last weeks
[18:24.660 --> 18:26.660]  of flowering when the plant
[18:26.660 --> 18:28.660]  doesn't actually use the
[18:28.780 --> 18:30.780]  system to utilize any of the
[18:30.780 --> 18:32.780]  potassium or phosphorus because it's
[18:32.780 --> 18:34.780]  trying to conserve its energy
[18:34.780 --> 18:36.780]  and direct it into flower production
[18:36.780 --> 18:38.780]  and the natural way for the plant
[18:38.780 --> 18:40.780]  to do such a thing
[18:40.780 --> 18:42.780]  and increase its chances of
[18:42.780 --> 18:44.780]  being pollinated is to store the nutrients
[18:44.780 --> 18:46.780]  in the upper canopy and one of the
[18:46.780 --> 18:48.780]  reasons why you guys are probably aware
[18:48.780 --> 18:50.780]  but very few people in the UK
[18:50.780 --> 18:52.780]  are aware that the autumnal colours
[18:52.780 --> 18:54.780]  that present themselves in the later
[18:54.780 --> 18:56.780]  stages of flowering is the cannibalistic
[18:56.900 --> 18:58.900]  mechanisms
[18:58.900 --> 19:00.900]  behind the plant
[19:00.900 --> 19:02.900]  eating everything that it's saved
[19:02.900 --> 19:04.900]  to swell the flowers as big as
[19:04.900 --> 19:06.900]  it possibly can and its actual
[19:06.900 --> 19:08.900]  energy expenditure that's used within
[19:08.900 --> 19:10.900]  the root system slows down
[19:10.900 --> 19:12.900]  so these
[19:12.900 --> 19:14.900]  nutrient companies are telling you to pump
[19:14.900 --> 19:16.900]  massive amounts of PK which is their
[19:16.900 --> 19:18.900]  most expensive product into the soil
[19:18.900 --> 19:20.900]  medium in the later stages of flowering
[19:20.900 --> 19:22.900]  when the root system isn't even
[19:22.900 --> 19:24.900]  absorbing. They do add some
[19:25.020 --> 19:27.020]  chemicals to try and force the plant
[19:27.020 --> 19:29.020]  to feed unnaturally when
[19:29.020 --> 19:31.020]  it's trying to cut off
[19:31.020 --> 19:33.020]  energy expenditures for the root system
[19:33.020 --> 19:35.020]  and then lo and behold at the end
[19:35.020 --> 19:37.020]  of your crop you're
[19:37.020 --> 19:39.020]  throwing that soil away, going to your
[19:39.020 --> 19:41.020]  hydroponic store and buying more soil
[19:41.020 --> 19:43.020]  and you're repeating the process over and over again
[19:43.020 --> 19:45.020]  so all of the videos that I do
[19:45.020 --> 19:47.020]  is to re-educate
[19:47.020 --> 19:49.020]  people and to explain to people
[19:49.020 --> 19:51.020]  that it's not necessary
[19:51.020 --> 19:53.020]  to do these things, you've been taken
[19:53.140 --> 19:55.140]  advantage of by the nutrient
[19:55.140 --> 19:57.140]  companies for many
[19:57.140 --> 19:59.140]  years and they have preyed
[19:59.140 --> 20:01.140]  on the naivety and the lack of understanding
[20:01.140 --> 20:03.140]  and the lack of education
[20:03.140 --> 20:05.140]  that the vast majority of people
[20:05.140 --> 20:07.140]  that grow cannabis for recreational
[20:07.140 --> 20:09.140]  purposes or commercial
[20:09.140 --> 20:11.140]  purposes are completely unaware of because
[20:11.140 --> 20:13.140]  they don't have any form of education
[20:13.140 --> 20:15.140]  in how the mechanisms
[20:15.140 --> 20:17.140]  behind a plant
[20:17.140 --> 20:19.140]  or the cannabis plant in particular
[20:19.140 --> 20:21.140]  actually
[20:21.260 --> 20:23.260]  grows.
[20:23.260 --> 20:25.260]  This is something that
[20:25.260 --> 20:27.260]  we're trying to break through
[20:27.260 --> 20:29.260]  in the United
[20:29.260 --> 20:31.260]  Kingdom and I've said this many times
[20:31.260 --> 20:33.260]  that the nutrient companies' days
[20:33.260 --> 20:35.260]  are numbered, they've taken advantage
[20:35.260 --> 20:37.260]  of people for so long
[20:37.260 --> 20:39.260]  and me
[20:39.260 --> 20:41.260]  in particular being someone who
[20:41.260 --> 20:43.260]  actually uses cannabis for
[20:43.260 --> 20:45.260]  a medicinal purpose, if I wasn't
[20:45.260 --> 20:47.260]  as
[20:47.260 --> 20:49.260]  learned as I am in
[20:49.380 --> 20:51.380]  the whole cannabis cultivation
[20:51.380 --> 20:53.380]  practice, then I would be
[20:53.380 --> 20:55.380]  another individual that would be falling victim
[20:55.380 --> 20:57.380]  to the clever marketing
[20:57.380 --> 20:59.380]  tactics from these
[20:59.380 --> 21:01.380]  nutrient companies. It's completely unacceptable,
[21:01.380 --> 21:03.380]  it's destructive to the planet
[21:03.380 --> 21:05.380]  and it's not beneficial
[21:05.380 --> 21:07.380]  to the end user, the only person
[21:07.380 --> 21:09.380]  it's beneficial to are the nutrient
[21:09.380 --> 21:11.380]  companies. This is the reason why they
[21:11.380 --> 21:13.380]  come up with all these
[21:13.380 --> 21:15.380]  clever market employees to try
[21:15.380 --> 21:17.380]  and increase
[21:17.500 --> 21:19.500]  their profits every year.
[21:19.500 --> 21:21.500]  Our ethos is I'm not really too concerned
[21:21.500 --> 21:23.500]  about making money, everybody wants to make money
[21:23.500 --> 21:25.500]  but I'm only going to do it in an
[21:25.500 --> 21:27.500]  honourable, true and just way.
[21:27.500 --> 21:29.500]  We sell a really good organic living
[21:29.500 --> 21:31.500]  soil, you can use a bloom
[21:31.500 --> 21:33.500]  amendment for extra
[21:33.500 --> 21:35.500]  terpene production
[21:35.500 --> 21:37.500]  and slightly increase
[21:37.500 --> 21:39.500]  your yield which would be comparable
[21:39.500 --> 21:41.500]  to the amount of money that the bloom amendment costs
[21:41.500 --> 21:43.500]  and then to reuse your soil
[21:43.500 --> 21:45.500]  and recharge the soil
[21:45.620 --> 21:47.620]  and use it again
[21:47.620 --> 21:49.620]  and get people out of this habit of
[21:49.620 --> 21:51.620]  throwing the soil away
[21:51.620 --> 21:53.620]  having to buy more nutrients
[21:53.620 --> 21:55.620]  and bring it in and out of the house
[21:55.620 --> 21:57.620]  in the hours of darkness so the neighbours don't see
[21:57.620 --> 21:59.620]  what you're doing type of thing.
[21:59.620 --> 22:01.620]  So that's probably
[22:01.620 --> 22:03.620]  a bit of the story
[22:03.620 --> 22:05.620]  about why Dr Organics
[22:05.620 --> 22:07.620]  came to fruition.
[22:07.620 --> 22:09.620]  So do you guys have
[22:09.620 --> 22:11.620]  a forum or
[22:11.620 --> 22:13.620]  conferences or
[22:13.740 --> 22:15.740]  educational
[22:15.740 --> 22:17.740]  places that people can learn
[22:17.740 --> 22:19.740]  more about living soil or
[22:19.740 --> 22:21.740]  is that just not done?
[22:21.740 --> 22:23.740]  It's just basically the live
[22:23.740 --> 22:25.740]  videos that I do
[22:25.740 --> 22:27.740]  myself and then
[22:27.740 --> 22:29.740]  a lot of people will
[22:29.740 --> 22:31.740]  look to people
[22:31.740 --> 22:33.740]  like Matt Mr Canucks
[22:33.740 --> 22:35.740]  and Mr Grow It
[22:35.740 --> 22:37.740]  other podcasters on YouTube
[22:37.740 --> 22:39.740]  in the United States where they
[22:39.740 --> 22:41.740]  have the freedom to speak
[22:41.860 --> 22:43.860]  and talk and grow and show
[22:43.860 --> 22:45.860]  their face and their plants
[22:45.860 --> 22:47.860]  without
[22:47.860 --> 22:49.860]  exposing
[22:49.860 --> 22:51.860]  themselves and having
[22:51.860 --> 22:53.860]  their doors put through for instance because
[22:53.860 --> 22:55.860]  it's legal, what they're doing is completely legal
[22:55.860 --> 22:57.860]  so they can be very open and very
[22:57.860 --> 22:59.860]  in depth and they can
[22:59.860 --> 23:01.860]  show people as well because seeing is believing
[23:01.860 --> 23:03.860]  like they can show step by step
[23:03.860 --> 23:05.860]  the step by step
[23:05.860 --> 23:07.860]  process
[23:07.860 --> 23:09.860]  of the living soil and explain
[23:09.980 --> 23:11.980]  things to people in a deep
[23:11.980 --> 23:13.980]  way, deep and meaningful way
[23:13.980 --> 23:15.980]  before there was no social media
[23:15.980 --> 23:17.980]  it was very
[23:17.980 --> 23:19.980]  difficult to have this level
[23:19.980 --> 23:21.980]  of communication with people
[23:21.980 --> 23:23.980]  in the wide range of things
[23:23.980 --> 23:25.980]  but now there is Instagram
[23:25.980 --> 23:27.980]  and it's only because I've got a bit of a
[23:27.980 --> 23:29.980]  fuck you attitude of like listen
[23:29.980 --> 23:31.980]  I've got Tourette's, I've smoked fucking
[23:31.980 --> 23:33.980]  cannabis
[23:33.980 --> 23:35.980]  I have a legitimate reason to do so
[23:35.980 --> 23:37.980]  if something, if my
[23:38.100 --> 23:40.100]  body is fucking put through, you take my plants away
[23:40.100 --> 23:42.100]  I'm only going to put them up the next day
[23:42.100 --> 23:44.100]  I've got a legitimate reason and I've been
[23:44.100 --> 23:46.100]  diagnosed from a child with these
[23:46.100 --> 23:48.100]  neurological disorders
[23:48.100 --> 23:50.100]  my circumstances
[23:50.100 --> 23:52.100]  and the level of the amount of plants
[23:52.100 --> 23:54.100]  that I grow is for my own personal use
[23:54.100 --> 23:56.100]  so
[23:56.100 --> 23:58.100]  as far as growing something
[23:58.100 --> 24:00.100]  in the guidelines of the British law
[24:00.100 --> 24:02.100]  if it's under a certain amount of plants
[24:02.100 --> 24:04.100]  and you're not doing it for
[24:04.100 --> 24:06.100]  mandatory gains, you're doing it
[24:06.220 --> 24:08.220]  for your own personal use
[24:08.220 --> 24:10.220]  you could be suffering from Parkinson's
[24:10.220 --> 24:12.220]  or Tourette's or whatever it is
[24:12.220 --> 24:14.220]  then there isn't really any
[24:14.220 --> 24:16.220]  detrimental
[24:16.220 --> 24:18.220]  consequences to your actions
[24:18.220 --> 24:20.220]  and so there shouldn't be either
[24:20.220 --> 24:22.220]  if you are growing vast amounts of it
[24:22.220 --> 24:24.220]  for mandatory gain
[24:24.220 --> 24:26.220]  and it's classed as criminal
[24:26.220 --> 24:28.220]  and the government aren't getting their taxes from it
[24:28.220 --> 24:30.220]  then it's a completely different story
[24:30.220 --> 24:32.220]  but if you're a fucking
[24:32.220 --> 24:34.220]  you're an individual that's got
[24:34.340 --> 24:36.340]  a neurological disorder and this is the only form
[24:36.340 --> 24:38.340]  of medicine that can help you
[24:38.340 --> 24:40.340]  then the government are fully aware
[24:40.340 --> 24:42.340]  in terms of mitigation
[24:42.340 --> 24:44.340]  of what's the reason
[24:44.340 --> 24:46.340]  why you're doing this
[24:46.340 --> 24:48.340]  for a while, this is the reason why
[24:48.340 --> 24:50.340]  and they're pretty understanded in that sense
[24:50.340 --> 24:52.340]  it's not like you get sent to jail
[24:52.340 --> 24:54.340]  or anything, you may get a fine
[24:54.340 --> 24:56.340]  so that's just the risk I've had to take
[24:56.340 --> 24:58.340]  and
[24:58.340 --> 25:00.340]  they're not really too concerned
[25:00.340 --> 25:02.340]  to be honest about people
[25:02.460 --> 25:04.460]  smoking a bit of weed
[25:04.460 --> 25:06.460]  like I said in certain parts of London
[25:06.460 --> 25:08.460]  you know
[25:08.460 --> 25:10.460]  the
[25:10.460 --> 25:12.460]  mayor of London
[25:12.460 --> 25:14.460]  has legalised
[25:14.460 --> 25:16.460]  certain areas
[25:16.460 --> 25:18.460]  that you're allowed to smoke
[25:18.460 --> 25:20.460]  so slowly but surely
[25:20.460 --> 25:22.460]  you know things are much different
[25:22.460 --> 25:24.460]  to what they were 10 years ago
[25:24.460 --> 25:26.460]  5 years ago and 20 years ago
[25:26.460 --> 25:28.460]  so that's how things are in the UK
[25:28.460 --> 25:30.460]  I know you guys probably aren't really up to date
[25:30.580 --> 25:32.580]  with how things are in this country
[25:32.580 --> 25:34.580]  no and that's why we're
[25:34.580 --> 25:36.580]  kind of drifting around
[25:36.580 --> 25:38.580]  living soils but we'll get there eventually
[25:38.580 --> 25:40.580]  so the mayor has actually
[25:40.580 --> 25:42.580]  declared green
[25:42.580 --> 25:44.580]  where you can
[25:44.580 --> 25:46.580]  consume cannabis
[25:46.580 --> 25:48.580]  there's certain areas that you can
[25:48.580 --> 25:50.580]  smoke it and if you go into London
[25:50.580 --> 25:52.580]  there's bars and
[25:52.580 --> 25:54.580]  cafes where they're
[25:54.580 --> 25:56.580]  freely selling CBD
[25:56.580 --> 25:58.580]  flour and selling non-CBD flour
[25:58.700 --> 26:00.700]  THC rich cannabis
[26:00.700 --> 26:02.700]  now this is the thing with the CBD
[26:02.700 --> 26:04.700]  and the cannabis
[26:04.700 --> 26:06.700]  the legalities in the UK
[26:06.700 --> 26:08.700]  that even hemp which is non-psychoactive
[26:08.700 --> 26:10.700]  and contains
[26:10.700 --> 26:12.700]  0.2% THC
[26:12.700 --> 26:14.700]  even growing
[26:14.700 --> 26:16.700]  a hemp plant you need a licence
[26:16.700 --> 26:18.700]  from the Home Office
[26:18.700 --> 26:20.700]  so if you wanted to grow hemp
[26:20.700 --> 26:22.700]  for instance to
[26:22.700 --> 26:24.700]  use the fibres to make rope
[26:24.700 --> 26:26.700]  and you can do that with perfect utility
[26:26.820 --> 26:28.820]  you need to have a licence from the Home Office
[26:28.820 --> 26:30.820]  and explain to them the reasons why you're growing it
[26:30.820 --> 26:32.820]  most people grow hemp commercially
[26:32.820 --> 26:34.820]  in the UK
[26:34.820 --> 26:36.820]  and they use it for all its
[26:36.820 --> 26:38.820]  properties, hemp oil and whatever else
[26:38.820 --> 26:40.820]  CBD is legal
[26:40.820 --> 26:42.820]  you can go into health stores and you can buy CBD
[26:42.820 --> 26:44.820]  so there's a little bit
[26:44.820 --> 26:46.820]  of bureaucracy
[26:46.820 --> 26:48.820]  and hypocritical
[26:48.820 --> 26:50.820]  laws that have been put in place
[26:50.820 --> 26:52.820]  it's a
[26:52.820 --> 26:54.820]  fucking plant at the end of the day
[26:54.940 --> 26:56.940]  imagine
[26:56.940 --> 26:58.940]  grass
[26:58.940 --> 27:00.940]  your average house grass
[27:00.940 --> 27:02.940]  imagine you could smoke that
[27:02.940 --> 27:04.940]  and it got you high
[27:04.940 --> 27:06.940]  ban grass and get rid of all the grass
[27:06.940 --> 27:08.940]  it just so happens that
[27:08.940 --> 27:10.940]  it's a plant that is quite easily
[27:10.940 --> 27:12.940]  identifiable and they can demonise
[27:12.940 --> 27:14.940]  people for it
[27:14.940 --> 27:16.940]  human civilisations
[27:16.940 --> 27:18.940]  across the world and cultures
[27:18.940 --> 27:20.940]  they change and we develop
[27:20.940 --> 27:22.940]  the only reason why it's not legal in the UK
[27:23.060 --> 27:25.060]  they haven't found a way where they can
[27:25.060 --> 27:27.060]  tax it and make money from it
[27:27.060 --> 27:29.060]  if they could then it would have been
[27:29.060 --> 27:31.060]  legal a long time ago
[27:31.060 --> 27:33.060]  because it would bring tremendous amounts
[27:33.060 --> 27:35.060]  of tax revenue
[27:35.060 --> 27:37.060]  to the government
[27:37.060 --> 27:39.060]  but as it is at the moment
[27:39.060 --> 27:41.060]  they have to keep things the way it is
[27:41.060 --> 27:43.060]  and they're slowly but surely looking
[27:43.060 --> 27:45.060]  at decriminalising
[27:45.060 --> 27:47.060]  it
[27:47.060 --> 27:49.060]  even in the UK
[27:49.060 --> 27:51.060]  you can get a
[27:51.180 --> 27:53.180]  prescription for medicinal marijuana
[27:53.180 --> 27:55.180]  so if you are a sufferer
[27:55.180 --> 27:57.180]  like Tourette's or you've got
[27:57.180 --> 27:59.180]  some other form of disorder
[27:59.180 --> 28:01.180]  you can go to the private doctor
[28:01.180 --> 28:03.180]  you can get a prescription
[28:03.180 --> 28:05.180]  but it has to be done through the private
[28:05.180 --> 28:07.180]  route
[28:07.180 --> 28:09.180]  we've got national health in the UK
[28:09.180 --> 28:11.180]  so we just get
[28:11.180 --> 28:13.180]  healthcare for free
[28:13.180 --> 28:15.180]  we pay taxes and out of our taxes
[28:15.180 --> 28:17.180]  our healthcare is put into that
[28:17.180 --> 28:19.180]  so if you want to go to hospital
[28:19.300 --> 28:21.300]  it's free
[28:21.300 --> 28:23.300]  you don't pay for anything
[28:23.300 --> 28:25.300]  you want to go to the doctor
[28:25.300 --> 28:27.300]  your kidneys removed
[28:27.300 --> 28:29.300]  it's free
[28:29.300 --> 28:31.300]  you don't need health insurance
[28:31.300 --> 28:33.300]  in the UK
[28:33.300 --> 28:35.300]  but if you want a prescription
[28:35.300 --> 28:37.300]  for cannabis
[28:37.300 --> 28:39.300]  then you have to go to a private
[28:39.300 --> 28:41.300]  practitioner
[28:41.300 --> 28:43.300]  and it costs £500-£700
[28:43.300 --> 28:45.300]  and then the actual marijuana
[28:45.300 --> 28:47.300]  itself
[28:47.420 --> 28:49.420]  the medical doctor
[28:49.420 --> 28:51.420]  in the UK will give you a prescription
[28:51.420 --> 28:53.420]  for cannabis
[28:53.420 --> 28:55.420]  but it's around £300-£400 an ounce
[28:55.420 --> 28:57.420]  and the street price of an ounce
[28:57.420 --> 28:59.420]  of weed in the UK
[28:59.420 --> 29:01.420]  is around £160
[29:01.420 --> 29:03.420]  maybe that's $200
[29:03.420 --> 29:05.420]  so
[29:05.420 --> 29:07.420]  they've made it that difficult
[29:07.420 --> 29:09.420]  that in order to get a prescription
[29:09.420 --> 29:11.420]  it just doesn't make sense to do so
[29:11.420 --> 29:13.420]  because
[29:13.420 --> 29:15.420]  the medicinal cannabis
[29:15.540 --> 29:17.540]  that's being made is so expensive
[29:17.540 --> 29:19.540]  that
[29:19.540 --> 29:21.540]  people can't afford it
[29:21.540 --> 29:23.540]  so they just go and buy it off the street
[29:23.540 --> 29:25.540]  you know
[29:25.540 --> 29:27.540]  wow that sounds so crazy
[29:27.540 --> 29:29.540]  so you can get a medical card
[29:29.540 --> 29:31.540]  but it's basically just abuse
[29:31.540 --> 29:33.540]  you can get a medical card
[29:33.540 --> 29:35.540]  so
[29:35.540 --> 29:37.540]  you get a medical card
[29:37.540 --> 29:39.540]  and a prescription
[29:39.540 --> 29:41.540]  so if you got caught walking down the street
[29:41.540 --> 29:43.540]  smoking it for instance
[29:43.660 --> 29:45.660]  the police can't do nothing about it
[29:45.660 --> 29:47.660]  you show your card
[29:47.660 --> 29:49.660]  sometimes they even try and take it off people
[29:49.660 --> 29:51.660]  but you can't be convicted
[29:51.660 --> 29:53.660]  you're not breaking the law
[29:53.660 --> 29:55.660]  you're legally entitled to do that
[29:55.660 --> 29:57.660]  and you can smoke it at will
[29:57.660 --> 29:59.660]  in whichever way you want it to be administrated
[29:59.660 --> 30:01.660]  vape it, smoke it, eat it, whatever
[30:01.660 --> 30:03.660]  it's your medicine to take
[30:03.660 --> 30:05.660]  whenever you want to take it
[30:05.660 --> 30:07.660]  but
[30:07.660 --> 30:09.660]  it's not really
[30:09.660 --> 30:11.660]  the norm
[30:11.780 --> 30:13.780]  and
[30:13.780 --> 30:15.780]  those that do have it
[30:15.780 --> 30:17.780]  will probably just smoke it
[30:17.780 --> 30:19.780]  in the confines of their own home
[30:19.780 --> 30:21.780]  or whatever else
[30:21.780 --> 30:23.780]  so the recognition is there
[30:23.780 --> 30:25.780]  that it has medicinal properties
[30:25.780 --> 30:27.780]  but it's just so bureaucratical
[30:27.780 --> 30:29.780]  and so much hypocrisy
[30:29.780 --> 30:31.780]  and so many people are suffering
[30:31.780 --> 30:33.780]  because of it
[30:33.780 --> 30:35.780]  it's quite sad to be quite honest
[30:35.780 --> 30:37.780]  and the government
[30:37.780 --> 30:39.780]  governments like people to take responsibility
[30:39.900 --> 30:41.900]  for their own
[30:41.900 --> 30:43.900]  it's all about money
[30:43.900 --> 30:45.900]  it's all about taxes
[30:45.900 --> 30:47.900]  and it's not about what's right, honourable, true and just
[30:47.900 --> 30:49.900]  and what's
[30:49.900 --> 30:51.900]  somebody like me
[30:51.900 --> 30:53.900]  who cannot live a normal life
[30:53.900 --> 30:55.900]  it's impossible for me
[30:55.900 --> 30:57.900]  I spent quite a lot of years in prison
[30:57.900 --> 30:59.900]  in my younger days as well
[30:59.900 --> 31:01.900]  it was a real struggle for me
[31:01.900 --> 31:03.900]  because I couldn't get hold of any cannabis
[31:03.900 --> 31:05.900]  regularly
[31:05.900 --> 31:07.900]  so I had to go through all different means
[31:08.900 --> 31:10.900]  just so I could function and just have a normal life
[31:10.900 --> 31:12.900]  just so I could go to sleep at night
[31:12.900 --> 31:14.900]  just so I could not be convulsed
[31:14.900 --> 31:16.900]  in and just live normally
[31:16.900 --> 31:18.900]  it's the most horrible debilitating thing
[31:18.900 --> 31:20.900]  I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy
[31:20.900 --> 31:22.900]  it's horrible
[31:22.900 --> 31:24.900]  it's so horrible that my Tourette's are so bad sometimes
[31:24.900 --> 31:26.900]  if I was given a choice to have
[31:26.900 --> 31:28.900]  both of my arms removed
[31:28.900 --> 31:30.900]  and have the Tourette's taken away
[31:30.900 --> 31:32.900]  then it would be a hard decision for me
[31:32.900 --> 31:34.900]  to make
[31:34.900 --> 31:36.900]  shall I just have my arms taken off
[31:37.900 --> 31:39.900]  and this neurological disease is gone
[31:39.900 --> 31:41.900]  I wouldn't go to that extreme
[31:41.900 --> 31:43.900]  personally myself
[31:43.900 --> 31:45.900]  but there's probably lots of people that have got it really severe
[31:45.900 --> 31:47.900]  that would, it's that debilitating
[31:47.900 --> 31:49.900]  and it's that horrible
[31:49.900 --> 31:51.900]  I wouldn't be able to do this interview if I hadn't smoked it
[31:51.900 --> 31:53.900]  I wouldn't be able to talk
[31:53.900 --> 31:55.900]  I wouldn't be able to do nothing at all
[31:55.900 --> 31:57.900]  I'd just be fucked
[31:57.900 --> 31:59.900]  I wouldn't be able to work
[31:59.900 --> 32:01.900]  I couldn't have a normal job
[32:01.900 --> 32:03.900]  I couldn't function as a normal human being
[32:03.900 --> 32:05.900]  I really don't know a tremendous amount
[32:05.900 --> 32:07.900]  of information about Tourette's
[32:07.900 --> 32:09.900]  but does it get worse
[32:09.900 --> 32:11.900]  or is it just not sick
[32:11.900 --> 32:13.900]  yeah it's like
[32:13.900 --> 32:15.900]  if I don't have the cannabis
[32:15.900 --> 32:17.900]  I'll be sniffing and blinking
[32:17.900 --> 32:19.900]  and going
[32:19.900 --> 32:21.900]  making noises
[32:21.900 --> 32:23.900]  and
[32:23.900 --> 32:25.900]  and shutting my eyes
[32:25.900 --> 32:27.900]  and banging my head
[32:27.900 --> 32:29.900]  and my arms will be moving
[32:29.900 --> 32:31.900]  like someone having a seizure sort of thing
[32:31.900 --> 32:33.900]  constantly all the time
[32:33.900 --> 32:35.900]  I have to smoke some of it
[32:35.900 --> 32:37.900]  and then it goes away
[32:37.900 --> 32:39.900]  and it will last for a few hours and I smoke a bit more
[32:39.900 --> 32:41.900]  that's what I have to do to have a normal life
[32:41.900 --> 32:43.900]  sometimes it will be alright
[32:43.900 --> 32:45.900]  it's waxes and wanes
[32:45.900 --> 32:47.900]  if I don't
[32:47.900 --> 32:49.900]  if I haven't got much stress in my life
[32:49.900 --> 32:51.900]  or whatever then I'm alright
[32:51.900 --> 32:53.900]  I go to the gym as well
[32:53.900 --> 32:55.900]  the gym really helps me
[32:55.900 --> 32:57.900]  dopamine release
[32:57.900 --> 32:59.900]  and it has a calming effect
[32:59.900 --> 33:01.900]  so it subdues the Tourette's
[33:01.900 --> 33:03.900]  and it's a good way
[33:03.900 --> 33:05.900]  so I've learnt to eat a healthy lifestyle
[33:05.900 --> 33:07.900]  not have a lot of stress
[33:07.900 --> 33:09.900]  have good sleep
[33:09.900 --> 33:11.900]  not eat sugars and stuff like that
[33:11.900 --> 33:13.900]  I train in the gym
[33:13.900 --> 33:15.900]  3-4 days a week
[33:15.900 --> 33:17.900]  don't over train, don't over stimulate the nervous system
[33:17.900 --> 33:19.900]  but just enough to
[33:19.900 --> 33:21.900]  subdue everything
[33:21.900 --> 33:23.900]  and then I just take as much cannabis as I need
[33:23.900 --> 33:25.900]  I don't even want to smoke
[33:25.900 --> 33:27.900]  I'm a health freak, I don't want to smoke
[33:27.900 --> 33:29.900]  I vape it, I don't want to get high
[33:29.900 --> 33:31.900]  I don't care about getting high
[33:31.900 --> 33:33.900]  I've got nothing to escape from
[33:33.900 --> 33:35.900]  I'm happy with my life the way it is
[33:35.900 --> 33:37.900]  I don't drink alcohol
[33:37.900 --> 33:39.900]  but it's the only thing that
[33:39.900 --> 33:41.900]  makes me feel ok
[33:41.900 --> 33:43.900]  and without it
[33:43.900 --> 33:45.900]  I don't have a very good life
[33:47.900 --> 33:49.900]  When it comes to that Dr. Organic
[33:49.900 --> 33:51.900]  some of the things you had mentioned
[33:51.900 --> 33:53.900]  when you had Tourette's
[33:53.900 --> 33:55.900]  my son when he was younger was suffering
[33:55.900 --> 33:57.900]  a lot from seizures
[33:57.900 --> 33:59.900]  and he found the CBD was helping
[33:59.900 --> 34:01.900]  and from what I understood it's because of the endocannabinoid system
[34:01.900 --> 34:03.900]  do you feel like that's also
[34:03.900 --> 34:05.900]  you're flushing that
[34:05.900 --> 34:07.900]  continuously
[34:07.900 --> 34:09.900]  and that's why you're able to live a normal life
[34:09.900 --> 34:11.900]  is because you realize that
[34:11.900 --> 34:13.900]  your body needs that
[34:13.900 --> 34:15.900]  to function
[34:15.900 --> 34:17.900]  Yeah, that's right
[34:17.900 --> 34:19.900]  everybody's different, everyone's biological makeup's different
[34:19.900 --> 34:21.900]  so for me it's just been like
[34:21.900 --> 34:23.900]  I don't need so much of this
[34:23.900 --> 34:25.900]  I try and do everything I can
[34:25.900 --> 34:27.900]  to reduce
[34:27.900 --> 34:29.900]  the amount of
[34:29.900 --> 34:31.900]  cannabis I need to function
[34:31.900 --> 34:33.900]  daily
[34:33.900 --> 34:35.900]  so if it's just a little bit more exercise
[34:35.900 --> 34:37.900]  or laying
[34:37.900 --> 34:39.900]  sometimes my Tourette's are so bad
[34:39.900 --> 34:41.900]  that I wake up
[34:41.900 --> 34:43.900]  I get lots of muscle pains and aches and stiffness
[34:43.900 --> 34:45.900]  because of the convulsions and jolting
[34:45.900 --> 34:47.900]  and headaches
[34:47.900 --> 34:49.900]  and my eyes hurt
[34:49.900 --> 34:51.900]  and my neck hurts because I'm doing
[34:51.900 --> 34:53.900]  jerking movements and that all the time
[34:53.900 --> 34:55.900]  and I've had
[34:55.900 --> 34:57.900]  people call me freak and spit
[34:57.900 --> 34:59.900]  at me in the street and try and
[34:59.900 --> 35:01.900]  throw me off of buses and be in restaurants
[35:01.900 --> 35:03.900]  and they're asking me to leave
[35:03.900 --> 35:05.900]  and family members have said
[35:05.900 --> 35:07.900]  he's got Tourette's, he can't help doing what he's doing
[35:07.900 --> 35:09.900]  and we don't care, just get out of our restaurant
[35:09.900 --> 35:11.900]  there's other customers, I've ended up going mad
[35:11.900 --> 35:13.900]  and fucking flipping the tables up and
[35:13.900 --> 35:15.900]  becoming aggressive and violent
[35:15.900 --> 35:17.900]  in certain situations
[35:17.900 --> 35:19.900]  because I'm so frustrated and angry
[35:19.900 --> 35:21.900]  that I've been demonized and victimized
[35:21.900 --> 35:23.900]  my whole entire life
[35:23.900 --> 35:25.900]  because of a disease
[35:25.900 --> 35:27.900]  a neurological disease or whatever
[35:27.900 --> 35:29.900]  you want to call it that I've got
[35:29.900 --> 35:31.900]  my life's been a battle from a young age
[35:31.900 --> 35:33.900]  at school, not being able to
[35:33.900 --> 35:35.900]  function in school
[35:35.900 --> 35:37.900]  normally and then it's a vicious circle
[35:37.900 --> 35:39.900]  I'd get really tired because I wouldn't get
[35:39.900 --> 35:41.900]  any meaningful rest and then the more
[35:41.900 --> 35:43.900]  tired I'd become, the worse my
[35:43.900 --> 35:45.900]  Tourette's would become and then the worse my Tourette's
[35:45.900 --> 35:47.900]  would become, the more irritable I'd get
[35:47.900 --> 35:49.900]  and frustrated and angry until
[35:49.900 --> 35:51.900]  I'd be so exhausted that
[35:51.900 --> 35:53.900]  I'd just shut down and have
[35:53.900 --> 35:55.900]  some sleep and
[35:55.900 --> 35:57.900]  so the cannabis and the
[35:57.900 --> 35:59.900]  exercise for me was my saviour
[36:01.900 --> 36:03.900]  the exercise as well, I've
[36:03.900 --> 36:05.900]  got it dialled in where I just eat healthy
[36:05.900 --> 36:07.900]  and that I don't take
[36:07.900 --> 36:09.900]  any caffeine or anything that stimulates
[36:09.900 --> 36:11.900]  my nervous system because it can just make
[36:11.900 --> 36:13.900]  it worse and stress
[36:13.900 --> 36:15.900]  more than anything if I'm
[36:15.900 --> 36:17.900]  stressed or whatever then
[36:17.900 --> 36:19.900]  it makes it
[36:19.900 --> 36:21.900]  bad as well. Yeah, people
[36:21.900 --> 36:23.900]  don't really give enough respect to
[36:23.900 --> 36:25.900]  stress when it comes to your body
[36:25.900 --> 36:27.900]  because you know, it
[36:27.900 --> 36:29.900]  really ages you, it
[36:29.900 --> 36:31.900]  throws everything out of whack
[36:31.900 --> 36:33.900]  so yeah
[36:33.900 --> 36:35.900]  and you know that's the
[36:35.900 --> 36:37.900]  beauty of this plant, it definitely helps
[36:37.900 --> 36:39.900]  to relieve stress
[36:39.900 --> 36:41.900]  especially if you're smoking a
[36:41.900 --> 36:43.900]  high CBD strength and
[36:43.900 --> 36:45.900]  I'm with you Doc, I mean I
[36:45.900 --> 36:47.900]  really enjoy
[36:47.900 --> 36:49.900]  smoking cannabis at night but during the
[36:49.900 --> 36:51.900]  day when I'm working
[36:51.900 --> 36:53.900]  I don't want to be altered, I want to be
[36:53.900 --> 36:55.900]  you know, depressed
[36:55.900 --> 36:57.900]  and I find even like the
[36:57.900 --> 36:59.900]  CBD strength that I smoke
[36:59.900 --> 37:01.900]  can have a
[37:01.900 --> 37:03.900]  adverse effect
[37:03.900 --> 37:05.900]  on the
[37:05.900 --> 37:07.900]  varietal or the cultivar
[37:07.900 --> 37:09.900]  so I tend to not even
[37:09.900 --> 37:11.900]  you know, try not to even smoke anything during
[37:11.900 --> 37:13.900]  the day unless like I said
[37:13.900 --> 37:15.900]  if I'm super stressed
[37:15.900 --> 37:17.900]  and I can't function any other way then it
[37:17.900 --> 37:19.900]  helps definitely.
[37:19.900 --> 37:21.900]  Let's dive into
[37:21.900 --> 37:23.900]  living soils, when did you first discover
[37:23.900 --> 37:25.900]  living soils and
[37:25.900 --> 37:27.900]  how are you achieving the biological
[37:27.900 --> 37:29.900]  levels?
[37:29.900 --> 37:31.900]  So, I've
[37:31.900 --> 37:33.900]  through over the
[37:33.900 --> 37:35.900]  years I've tried you know, deep water culture
[37:35.900 --> 37:37.900]  flood and drain systems, soil
[37:37.900 --> 37:39.900]  using organics
[37:39.900 --> 37:41.900]  I used to use
[37:41.900 --> 37:43.900]  well say I used to use, I tried
[37:43.900 --> 37:45.900]  because I like to experiment and try different things
[37:45.900 --> 37:47.900]  I used to use 434
[37:47.900 --> 37:49.900]  I think it's Dr Hornby by Green Planet
[37:49.900 --> 37:51.900]  it's just like an all in one that you can use from
[37:51.900 --> 37:53.900]  start to finish, like 100% organic
[37:53.900 --> 37:55.900]  so because I'm
[37:55.900 --> 37:57.900]  consuming the product at the end
[37:57.900 --> 37:59.900]  for me it has to
[37:59.900 --> 38:01.900]  be 100% organic and I won't buy anything
[38:01.900 --> 38:03.900]  off the streets because I don't know what
[38:03.900 --> 38:05.900]  it's got in it or how it's been grown, if it's had
[38:05.900 --> 38:07.900]  PGRs or carcinogenics
[38:07.900 --> 38:09.900]  put in it or whatever else, so I'll only smoke stuff
[38:09.900 --> 38:11.900]  that I grow myself
[38:11.900 --> 38:13.900]  because it was something that I needed
[38:15.900 --> 38:17.900]  it's been an obsession with mine
[38:17.900 --> 38:19.900]  and it just brings me a lot of peace and tranquility
[38:19.900 --> 38:21.900]  and joy, you know I just sit in there and play the music
[38:21.900 --> 38:23.900]  sometimes and just look at the plants and
[38:23.900 --> 38:25.900]  see how they're doing
[38:25.900 --> 38:27.900]  it's very therapeutic you know
[38:27.900 --> 38:29.900]  it helps me in a lot of ways
[38:29.900 --> 38:31.900]  and with the living soil
[38:31.900 --> 38:33.900]  I've been using my
[38:33.900 --> 38:35.900]  own living soil
[38:35.900 --> 38:37.900]  different ratios of amendments
[38:37.900 --> 38:39.900]  whether it's blood mill, fish mill, bone mill
[38:39.900 --> 38:41.900]  insect press, alfalfa mill
[38:43.900 --> 38:45.900]  different ratios
[38:45.900 --> 38:47.900]  rock dust and fine
[38:47.900 --> 38:49.900]  tuning, little bit more of this, little bit less
[38:49.900 --> 38:51.900]  of that, so it's like 20 years worth of research
[38:51.900 --> 38:53.900]  and development and this works better
[38:53.900 --> 38:55.900]  and I've got a higher nitrogen content
[38:55.900 --> 38:57.900]  and this is lasting
[38:57.900 --> 38:59.900]  longer and allowing the plant to survive
[38:59.900 --> 39:01.900]  and flourish
[39:01.900 --> 39:03.900]  at a greater rate than it was
[39:03.900 --> 39:05.900]  with using
[39:05.900 --> 39:07.900]  less of it, so it's just been
[39:07.900 --> 39:09.900]  fine tuning things over all those years
[39:09.900 --> 39:11.900]  to get to the
[39:11.900 --> 39:13.900]  dry amendment
[39:13.900 --> 39:15.900]  the combination dry amendment that I do
[39:15.900 --> 39:17.900]  so in our dry amendment
[39:17.900 --> 39:19.900]  we've got krill mill
[39:19.900 --> 39:21.900]  fish mill, neem mill, kelp mill
[39:21.900 --> 39:23.900]  alfalfa mill, garden lime
[39:23.900 --> 39:25.900]  bone mill, back salt
[39:25.900 --> 39:27.900]  humic fulvoric acid, insect press
[39:27.900 --> 39:29.900]  mycorrhizal fungi
[39:29.900 --> 39:31.900]  and malted barley powder
[39:31.900 --> 39:33.900]  so each and every single one of those
[39:33.900 --> 39:35.900]  has its own purposes
[39:35.900 --> 39:37.900]  malted barley powder
[39:37.900 --> 39:39.900]  helps in finishing the plants
[39:39.900 --> 39:41.900]  quicker, the mycorrhizal fungi
[39:41.900 --> 39:43.900]  for the
[39:43.900 --> 39:45.900]  root
[39:45.900 --> 39:47.900]  anchoring and growth
[39:47.900 --> 39:49.900]  alfalfa mill has a naturally occurring
[39:49.900 --> 39:51.900]  plant growth regulator
[39:51.900 --> 39:53.900]  the ancient Egyptians have been using it for thousands
[39:53.900 --> 39:55.900]  of years to increase crop productivity
[39:55.900 --> 39:57.900]  the krill mill
[39:57.900 --> 39:59.900]  the fish mill, higher nitrogen
[39:59.900 --> 40:01.900]  neem mill, the insect press
[40:01.900 --> 40:03.900]  to deter pests
[40:03.900 --> 40:05.900]  because of the
[40:07.900 --> 40:09.900]  scent that it gives off
[40:09.900 --> 40:11.900]  of the dead carcasses
[40:11.900 --> 40:13.900]  of insects
[40:13.900 --> 40:15.900]  it deters pests from
[40:15.900 --> 40:17.900]  taking up home in the soil
[40:17.900 --> 40:19.900]  so all of the different
[40:19.900 --> 40:21.900]  benefits
[40:21.900 --> 40:23.900]  that all these different things have
[40:23.900 --> 40:25.900]  they all have their purpose
[40:25.900 --> 40:27.900]  and then over the years I've just added a bit
[40:27.900 --> 40:29.900]  more of this and tried a different ratio
[40:29.900 --> 40:31.900]  the soil itself
[40:31.900 --> 40:33.900]  we use a lot of
[40:33.900 --> 40:35.900]  coco coir, around 50%
[40:35.900 --> 40:37.900]  coco coir and then we've got our own
[40:37.900 --> 40:39.900]  compost that we make
[40:39.900 --> 40:41.900]  but so many people
[40:41.900 --> 40:43.900]  are buying our soil now, we've had to outsource
[40:43.900 --> 40:45.900]  the compost to a local
[40:45.900 --> 40:47.900]  farm that
[40:47.900 --> 40:49.900]  produces their own compost as well
[40:51.900 --> 40:53.900]  I'm not really somebody
[40:53.900 --> 40:55.900]  to...am I still there?
[40:55.900 --> 40:57.900]  Yeah, loud and
[40:57.900 --> 40:59.900]  clear
[41:27.900 --> 41:29.900]  this isn't the natural environment of the cannabis plant
[41:29.900 --> 41:31.900]  and I know it's
[41:31.900 --> 41:33.900]  done for the reasoning to try and
[41:33.900 --> 41:35.900]  increase microbial activity
[41:35.900 --> 41:37.900]  but the level of microbial activity that's
[41:37.900 --> 41:39.900]  needed to break down the amendments
[41:39.900 --> 41:41.900]  and supply
[41:41.900 --> 41:43.900]  the food with
[41:43.900 --> 41:45.900]  enough of this essential
[41:45.900 --> 41:47.900]  NPK that it needs to flourish
[41:47.900 --> 41:49.900]  it waxes
[41:49.900 --> 41:51.900]  and wanes
[41:51.900 --> 41:53.900]  and the waning of allowing
[41:53.900 --> 41:55.900]  the soil to dry out doesn't
[41:55.900 --> 41:57.900]  diminish or utterly
[41:57.900 --> 41:59.900]  deplete microbial life and it definitely doesn't
[41:59.900 --> 42:01.900]  diminish it or deplete it
[42:01.900 --> 42:03.900]  to an extent where there
[42:03.900 --> 42:05.900]  is a lesser amount of food
[42:05.900 --> 42:07.900]  that becomes available
[42:07.900 --> 42:09.900]  so by putting a mulch on the top
[42:09.900 --> 42:11.900]  and keeping the soil
[42:11.900 --> 42:13.900]  moist a lot more than
[42:13.900 --> 42:15.900]  what it's designed
[42:15.900 --> 42:17.900]  to thrive in
[42:17.900 --> 42:19.900]  you're limiting
[42:19.900 --> 42:21.900]  root growth
[42:21.900 --> 42:23.900]  you're limiting aeration
[42:23.900 --> 42:25.900]  you're promoting root rot
[42:25.900 --> 42:27.900]  where if you allow
[42:27.900 --> 42:29.900]  drier periods as is
[42:29.900 --> 42:31.900]  what the cannabis plant is
[42:31.900 --> 42:33.900]  used to and loves
[42:33.900 --> 42:35.900]  it increases root health
[42:35.900 --> 42:37.900]  and root health
[42:37.900 --> 42:39.900]  and root growth
[42:39.900 --> 42:41.900]  in my opinion
[42:41.900 --> 42:43.900]  and anecdotal evidence from
[42:43.900 --> 42:45.900]  all the years that I've been doing it
[42:45.900 --> 42:47.900]  probably Organic Living Soil
[42:47.900 --> 42:49.900]  the best part of 15 years that I've been
[42:49.900 --> 42:51.900]  growing with it so I'm not new
[42:51.900 --> 42:53.900]  but in my
[42:53.900 --> 42:55.900]  personal opinion allowing the soil to dry
[42:55.900 --> 42:57.900]  out but never come completely bone dry
[42:57.900 --> 42:59.900]  is more
[42:59.900 --> 43:01.900]  beneficial to the root system
[43:01.900 --> 43:03.900]  and the plant and its overall health
[43:03.900 --> 43:05.900]  than trying to maintain
[43:05.900 --> 43:07.900]  a level of moisture in the soil
[43:07.900 --> 43:09.900]  purely and simply for
[43:09.900 --> 43:11.900]  the purposes of increasing microbial
[43:11.900 --> 43:13.900]  activity because allowing
[43:13.900 --> 43:15.900]  the soil to dry out but not become
[43:15.900 --> 43:17.900]  completely dry doesn't diminish
[43:17.900 --> 43:19.900]  the microbial activity to a level
[43:19.900 --> 43:21.900]  where the plant doesn't have
[43:21.900 --> 43:23.900]  adequate amount of
[43:23.900 --> 43:25.900]  food. It's always at the
[43:25.900 --> 43:27.900]  peak of
[43:27.900 --> 43:29.900]  food availability
[43:29.900 --> 43:31.900]  irrespective of whether the
[43:31.900 --> 43:33.900]  microbial life
[43:33.900 --> 43:35.900]  has slightly dropped for 3
[43:35.900 --> 43:37.900]  or 4 days because you've allowed it to
[43:37.900 --> 43:39.900]  dry out instead of just trying
[43:39.900 --> 43:41.900]  to keep it moist all the time
[43:41.900 --> 43:43.900]  with the cover crop and
[43:43.900 --> 43:45.900]  other stuff that poop you. So I never use a cover crop
[43:45.900 --> 43:47.900]  I have tried it
[43:47.900 --> 43:49.900]  and I've always had better results
[43:49.900 --> 43:51.900]  not using it and those are the
[43:51.900 --> 43:53.900]  reasoning behind. I always try
[43:53.900 --> 43:55.900]  and look at the cannabis plant of
[43:55.900 --> 43:57.900]  what is it used to and what is
[43:57.900 --> 43:59.900]  it genetically
[43:59.900 --> 44:01.900]  engineered
[44:01.900 --> 44:03.900]  to grow
[44:03.900 --> 44:05.900]  and thrive in its
[44:05.900 --> 44:07.900]  natural environment and its natural environment
[44:07.900 --> 44:09.900]  isn't to be grown in a country
[44:09.900 --> 44:11.900]  where there's mulches and cover crops
[44:11.900 --> 44:13.900]  and a consistent
[44:13.900 --> 44:15.900]  level of high moisture in the soil
[44:15.900 --> 44:17.900]  that's just not what the cannabis plant
[44:17.900 --> 44:19.900]  is used to
[44:19.900 --> 44:21.900]  or genetically designed
[44:21.900 --> 44:23.900]  to do so. It's going against
[44:23.900 --> 44:25.900]  what its make up
[44:25.900 --> 44:27.900]  and genetic structure
[44:27.900 --> 44:29.900]  has enabled it to survive
[44:29.900 --> 44:31.900]  as long as it has done
[44:31.900 --> 44:33.900]  so maybe that's my
[44:33.900 --> 44:35.900]  reason behind doing it and
[44:35.900 --> 44:37.900]  through all the different trials
[44:37.900 --> 44:39.900]  and experiments that I've done
[44:39.900 --> 44:41.900]  I've always
[44:41.900 --> 44:43.900]  had much greater results and I can
[44:43.900 --> 44:45.900]  only account those results to
[44:45.900 --> 44:47.900]  the
[44:47.900 --> 44:49.900]  root structure and the
[44:49.900 --> 44:51.900]  overall root health of the
[44:51.900 --> 44:53.900]  plant by allowing
[44:53.900 --> 44:55.900]  that wet dry cycle but as I said
[44:55.900 --> 44:57.900]  never to fully let the soil become
[44:57.900 --> 44:59.900]  completely dry. I know other people may
[44:59.900 --> 45:01.900]  argue with me and maybe they've got some other
[45:01.900 --> 45:03.900]  valid points to it but me personally
[45:03.900 --> 45:05.900]  I've tried both
[45:05.900 --> 45:07.900]  on many many different occasions
[45:07.900 --> 45:09.900]  and allowing that wet dry cycle
[45:09.900 --> 45:11.900]  for the reasons
[45:11.900 --> 45:13.900]  stated has always been far more
[45:13.900 --> 45:15.900]  beneficial than trying to
[45:15.900 --> 45:17.900]  maintain a level of microbial activity
[45:17.900 --> 45:19.900]  which is far above
[45:19.900 --> 45:21.900]  and beyond what is needed to
[45:21.900 --> 45:23.900]  break down the amendments anyway. You only need
[45:23.900 --> 45:25.900]  a certain amount of microbial activity
[45:25.900 --> 45:27.900]  for the amendments or
[45:27.900 --> 45:29.900]  whatever organic matter in your soil is being
[45:29.900 --> 45:31.900]  broken down to become available to the
[45:31.900 --> 45:33.900]  plant. So by doubling, tripling,
[45:33.900 --> 45:35.900]  quadrupling your microbial
[45:35.900 --> 45:37.900]  life it doesn't in turn allow
[45:37.900 --> 45:39.900]  the plant to feed at any
[45:39.900 --> 45:41.900]  greater rate as with an organic living
[45:41.900 --> 45:43.900]  soil the plant is only going to take up
[45:43.900 --> 45:45.900]  whatever it requires
[45:45.900 --> 45:47.900]  at a specific time
[45:47.900 --> 45:57.900]  in relation to its genetics anyhow. So you can put all the microbes under the sun into the soil. It's not going to increase your yield.
[45:57.900 --> 45:59.900]  I'm trying to explain this to people that the
[45:59.900 --> 46:01.900]  yield is determined primarily with
[46:01.900 --> 46:03.900]  the genetics of the plant.
[46:03.900 --> 46:05.900]  It's going to have, you know, I'll
[46:05.900 --> 46:07.900]  compare it to, you've got Danny DeVito and you've got
[46:07.900 --> 46:09.900]  Arnold Schwarzenegger. Danny DeVito
[46:09.900 --> 46:11.900]  genetically can only get to a certain
[46:11.900 --> 46:13.900]  size. Arnold Schwarzenegger genetically
[46:13.900 --> 46:15.900]  can get much bigger. So if you've got an
[46:15.900 --> 46:17.900]  Arnold Schwarzenegger genes of a plant
[46:17.900 --> 46:19.900]  it's going to always be head and shoulders above
[46:19.900 --> 46:21.900]  a plant that doesn't have those
[46:21.900 --> 46:23.900]  same type of genetic predispositions.
[46:23.900 --> 46:25.900]  Then how
[46:25.900 --> 46:27.900]  you've filled your canopy, a lot
[46:27.900 --> 46:29.900]  of people, they don't utilise the canopy space
[46:29.900 --> 46:31.900]  enough. A lot
[46:31.900 --> 46:35.900]  of people are defoliating the plant too much.
[46:35.900 --> 46:37.900]  It's another thing to come
[46:37.900 --> 46:39.900]  onto. I don't
[46:39.900 --> 46:41.900]  really defoliate the plant
[46:41.900 --> 46:43.900]  overly. I only defoliate the
[46:43.900 --> 46:45.900]  plant enough to
[46:45.900 --> 46:47.900]  enable adequate air flow
[46:47.900 --> 46:49.900]  because
[46:49.900 --> 46:51.900]  the canopy of the
[46:51.900 --> 46:53.900]  plant is what drives photosynthesis
[46:53.900 --> 46:55.900]  and photosynthesis is the
[46:55.900 --> 46:57.900]  energy required to promote
[46:57.900 --> 46:59.900]  flower production. So if you strip away
[46:59.900 --> 47:01.900]  all the solar panels on the plant, it
[47:01.900 --> 47:03.900]  may look good and they may all be praying very
[47:03.900 --> 47:05.900]  happily but in
[47:05.900 --> 47:07.900]  terms of the science
[47:07.900 --> 47:09.900]  behind the productivity of
[47:09.900 --> 47:11.900]  a plant and how much energy it
[47:11.900 --> 47:13.900]  can translate through photosynthesis
[47:13.900 --> 47:15.900]  into
[47:15.900 --> 47:17.900]  flower production
[47:17.900 --> 47:19.900]  by stripping
[47:19.900 --> 47:21.900]  away all the leaves, which a lot of people
[47:21.900 --> 47:23.900]  do, it's only to
[47:23.900 --> 47:25.900]  a discredit of
[47:25.900 --> 47:27.900]  the plant. This is through
[47:27.900 --> 47:29.900]  20 years of doing this. I've tried it
[47:29.900 --> 47:31.900]  with, I've tried it without on multiple occasions
[47:31.900 --> 47:33.900]  with multiple different strains time and time again.
[47:33.900 --> 47:35.900]  There's a happy balance, a happy medium.
[47:35.900 --> 47:37.900]  If you strip away too many leaves,
[47:37.900 --> 47:39.900]  it's detrimental to the plant. If
[47:39.900 --> 47:41.900]  you've got too much foliage in there and you don't have
[47:41.900 --> 47:43.900]  adequate air flow and things are being
[47:43.900 --> 47:45.900]  covered, then that can
[47:45.900 --> 47:47.900]  also be detrimental. So it's a balance
[47:47.900 --> 47:49.900]  like not saying not to defoliate
[47:49.900 --> 47:51.900]  but I do it very minimally. I just do
[47:51.900 --> 47:53.900]  the minimal amount needed to achieve
[47:53.900 --> 47:55.900]  adequate air flow. And then
[47:55.900 --> 47:57.900]  obviously your light
[47:57.900 --> 47:59.900]  and your overall
[47:59.900 --> 48:01.900]  PPFD and PAR
[48:01.900 --> 48:03.900]  that the canopy is using. So
[48:03.900 --> 48:05.900]  in order to get these great yields
[48:05.900 --> 48:07.900]  you need to utilize the space correctly.
[48:07.900 --> 48:09.900]  Good genetics would also be
[48:09.900 --> 48:11.900]  a preferable thing to have to
[48:11.900 --> 48:13.900]  maximize
[48:13.900 --> 48:15.900]  the genes of the
[48:15.900 --> 48:17.900]  plant. And then your
[48:17.900 --> 48:19.900]  light coverage. And a lot of people are just
[48:19.900 --> 48:21.900]  of the proclivity that
[48:21.900 --> 48:23.900]  it's nutrients, nutrients, nutrients.
[48:23.900 --> 48:25.900]  I use this booster, I use this, I use
[48:25.900 --> 48:27.900]  that. This is what's going to do it. This is
[48:27.900 --> 48:29.900]  what's going to do it. This is what's going to give me the yield.
[48:29.900 --> 48:31.900]  Now that's not what gives you the yield at all.
[48:31.900 --> 48:33.900]  These things that I've just spoken about
[48:33.900 --> 48:35.900]  is what gives you the yield
[48:35.900 --> 48:37.900]  because that's what everyone's looking for to try
[48:37.900 --> 48:39.900]  and get as much medicine as they possibly can
[48:39.900 --> 48:41.900]  every time they grow it.
[48:41.900 --> 48:43.900]  So all of my videos
[48:43.900 --> 48:45.900]  that I do, all of
[48:45.900 --> 48:47.900]  these different
[48:47.900 --> 48:49.900]  aspects of
[48:49.900 --> 48:51.900]  growing is what I talk about.
[48:51.900 --> 48:53.900]  That's
[48:53.900 --> 48:55.900]  what we were kind of hoping for.
[48:55.900 --> 48:57.900]  Layton and I were hoping, you know, you have
[48:57.900 --> 48:59.900]  a different viewpoint on a
[48:59.900 --> 49:01.900]  few things that other people
[49:01.900 --> 49:03.900]  obviously have been on the show kind of arguing
[49:03.900 --> 49:05.900]  for on a different side.
[49:05.900 --> 49:07.900]  That's obviously the goal of this show
[49:07.900 --> 49:09.900]  is to bring both sides
[49:09.900 --> 49:11.900]  to that and obviously show two bright
[49:11.900 --> 49:13.900]  minded individuals that have one path
[49:13.900 --> 49:15.900]  and the other one has
[49:15.900 --> 49:17.900]  their own path as well.
[49:17.900 --> 49:19.900]  When you say that you've been,
[49:19.900 --> 49:21.900]  so you've understood how to cultivate
[49:21.900 --> 49:23.900]  cannabis using a living soil
[49:23.900 --> 49:25.900]  for 15 years.
[49:25.900 --> 49:27.900]  Did I hear that correctly?
[49:27.900 --> 49:29.900]  Yeah, man.
[49:29.900 --> 49:31.900]  My granddad was
[49:31.900 --> 49:33.900]  an avid allotment
[49:33.900 --> 49:35.900]  and he's
[49:35.900 --> 49:37.900]  passed away so many years but
[49:37.900 --> 49:39.900]  he was aware of my story
[49:39.900 --> 49:41.900]  and journey about cannabis and I used to
[49:41.900 --> 49:43.900]  grow it myself and even in his garden
[49:43.900 --> 49:45.900]  in his
[49:45.900 --> 49:47.900]  greenhouse when I was
[49:47.900 --> 49:49.900]  very young, he'd be
[49:49.900 --> 49:51.900]  helping me grow cannabis
[49:51.900 --> 49:53.900]  and my granddad was a lovely person
[49:53.900 --> 49:55.900]  and he'd be like, ask my son
[49:55.900 --> 49:57.900]  no matter what helps you
[49:57.900 --> 49:59.900]  I'll
[49:59.900 --> 50:01.900]  support you with it. So he used to
[50:01.900 --> 50:03.900]  help me grow cannabis plants
[50:03.900 --> 50:05.900]  in the greenhouse and
[50:05.900 --> 50:07.900]  it was only blood meal, fish meal
[50:07.900 --> 50:09.900]  and bone meal that allotment has had
[50:09.900 --> 50:11.900]  and my granddad used to produce
[50:11.900 --> 50:13.900]  award winning vegetables with rosettes
[50:13.900 --> 50:15.900]  and cucumbers that were
[50:15.900 --> 50:17.900]  10 foot long and that's a bit of an
[50:17.900 --> 50:19.900]  exaggeration but all these monstrous
[50:19.900 --> 50:21.900]  vegetables and
[50:21.900 --> 50:23.900]  this was from a young age where
[50:23.900 --> 50:25.900]  the cannabis
[50:25.900 --> 50:27.900]  hydro shops weren't really that
[50:27.900 --> 50:29.900]  big of a thing, they were more head shops
[50:29.900 --> 50:31.900]  in those
[50:31.900 --> 50:33.900]  days and it was just limited high pressure
[50:33.900 --> 50:35.900]  sodium bulbs
[50:35.900 --> 50:37.900]  and regular seed
[50:37.900 --> 50:39.900]  sort of thing. So I started off growing
[50:39.900 --> 50:41.900]  cannabis at a young age for my
[50:41.900 --> 50:43.900]  own and smoking it when
[50:43.900 --> 50:45.900]  I was 14, 15, 16 because I first
[50:45.900 --> 50:47.900]  started smoking it at a youth centre when I was
[50:47.900 --> 50:49.900]  14 and that's when
[50:49.900 --> 50:51.900]  I had the moment of oh I don't have any tourettes
[50:51.900 --> 50:53.900]  anymore and I carried on smoking it ever since
[50:53.900 --> 50:55.900]  So my granddad
[50:55.900 --> 50:57.900]  being an avid allotmenter
[50:57.900 --> 50:59.900]  would
[50:59.900 --> 51:01.900]  grow
[51:01.900 --> 51:03.900]  the cannabis with me and we'd go to the library
[51:03.900 --> 51:05.900]  and we'd have a look at the cannabis
[51:05.900 --> 51:07.900]  plant, what it requires and
[51:07.900 --> 51:09.900]  whether it likes a clay
[51:09.900 --> 51:11.900]  soil or a waterlogged soil or an
[51:11.900 --> 51:13.900]  aerated soil and we'd be using
[51:13.900 --> 51:15.900]  our own
[51:15.900 --> 51:17.900]  compost
[51:17.900 --> 51:19.900]  and shingle as
[51:19.900 --> 51:21.900]  drainage because we didn't really have perlite
[51:21.900 --> 51:23.900]  or
[51:25.900 --> 51:27.900]  volcanic
[51:27.900 --> 51:29.900]  stone, pumice and stuff like that
[51:29.900 --> 51:31.900]  So that's how I started growing the cannabis
[51:31.900 --> 51:33.900]  just using water
[51:33.900 --> 51:35.900]  out of the tap and this is another
[51:35.900 --> 51:37.900]  avenue
[51:37.900 --> 51:39.900]  with the whole
[51:39.900 --> 51:41.900]  dechlorinating water and pH and stuff
[51:41.900 --> 51:43.900]  For the 20 years that I've been
[51:43.900 --> 51:45.900]  growing, dechlorinating the water
[51:45.900 --> 51:47.900]  in the UK, the UK we've got good water
[51:47.900 --> 51:49.900]  the water manual for
[51:49.900 --> 51:51.900]  the
[51:51.900 --> 51:53.900]  cleanliness of the water is some of the
[51:53.900 --> 51:55.900]  safest in the world, that's why we can
[51:55.900 --> 51:57.900]  just drink it as is and chlorine itself
[51:57.900 --> 51:59.900]  people believe chlorine to be an enemy
[51:59.900 --> 52:01.900]  like oh no chlorine, you know you can't have any
[52:01.900 --> 52:03.900]  chlorine, well the amount of chlorine
[52:03.900 --> 52:05.900]  present in tap water is
[52:05.900 --> 52:07.900]  infinitesimally small, it's so minute as a matter
[52:07.900 --> 52:09.900]  of fact that it has absolutely
[52:09.900 --> 52:11.900]  zero bearing on microbial activity
[52:11.900 --> 52:13.900]  you know in some scientific
[52:13.900 --> 52:15.900]  papers they say that it has a
[52:15.900 --> 52:17.900]  slight diminishing
[52:17.900 --> 52:19.900]  property
[52:19.900 --> 52:21.900]  for a very small period but
[52:21.900 --> 52:23.900]  microbes
[52:23.900 --> 52:25.900]  multiply at such an
[52:25.900 --> 52:27.900]  exponential rate that the rate of
[52:27.900 --> 52:29.900]  multiplication is far greater than
[52:29.900 --> 52:31.900]  the rate of diminishing so
[52:31.900 --> 52:33.900]  using chlorine in the water can't actually
[52:33.900 --> 52:35.900]  deplete microbial life
[52:35.900 --> 52:37.900]  in any way shape or form that would ever
[52:37.900 --> 52:39.900]  be detrimental to the plant and like
[52:39.900 --> 52:41.900]  you see in front of me in all the videos that I do
[52:41.900 --> 52:43.900]  I just have a 5x5
[52:43.900 --> 52:45.900]  you know and I grow
[52:45.900 --> 52:47.900]  2.2 pounds, I can grow 4 pounds in a
[52:47.900 --> 52:49.900]  5x5 and I've done it on many videos
[52:49.900 --> 52:51.900]  and I've got all the dry weights and that to prove
[52:51.900 --> 52:53.900]  to people, 2,000 grams
[52:53.900 --> 52:55.900]  in a 5x5 with our own strains
[52:55.900 --> 52:57.900]  nothing but tap water and living soil
[52:57.900 --> 52:59.900]  from beginning to end and I've said to
[52:59.900 --> 53:01.900]  many people not to be egotistical like
[53:01.900 --> 53:03.900]  you can use whatever nutrients you want
[53:03.900 --> 53:05.900]  and use whatever strain you want, if you think
[53:05.900 --> 53:07.900]  that you can grow more then please put it up and show
[53:07.900 --> 53:09.900]  everybody because I haven't, you know there's millions
[53:09.900 --> 53:11.900]  of people on Facebook and
[53:11.900 --> 53:13.900]  no discredit to anyone else
[53:13.900 --> 53:15.900]  that's on YouTube with many followers but they're not
[53:15.900 --> 53:17.900]  doing it either and you know I'm sure there
[53:17.900 --> 53:19.900]  are people out there that can grow huge
[53:19.900 --> 53:21.900]  plants and the genetics is one of the
[53:21.900 --> 53:23.900]  main reasons why I'm able to achieve
[53:23.900 --> 53:25.900]  those results only with that particular
[53:25.900 --> 53:27.900]  strain mind you
[53:27.900 --> 53:29.900]  but the
[53:29.900 --> 53:31.900]  the
[53:31.900 --> 53:33.900]  chlorine so anything
[53:33.900 --> 53:35.900]  in excess is detrimental to the plant
[53:35.900 --> 53:37.900]  if you give it too much nitrogen you get nitrogen
[53:37.900 --> 53:39.900]  toxicity, if you give it too much
[53:39.900 --> 53:41.900]  potassium, whatever a plant
[53:41.900 --> 53:43.900]  requires, too much of
[53:43.900 --> 53:45.900]  it is toxic but
[53:45.900 --> 53:47.900]  do people not aware that
[53:47.900 --> 53:49.900]  contained within dry amendments
[53:49.900 --> 53:51.900]  whether it's blood meal or fish meal or
[53:51.900 --> 53:53.900]  bone meal, the chlorine is present in that
[53:53.900 --> 53:55.900]  so I say to people hang on a minute so you want
[53:55.900 --> 53:57.900]  to take the chlorine out of the water
[53:57.900 --> 53:59.900]  but the very dry amendments that you're
[53:59.900 --> 54:01.900]  using once they're broken down actually
[54:01.900 --> 54:03.900]  contain chlorine so
[54:03.900 --> 54:05.900]  the fish meal and fish carcasses
[54:05.900 --> 54:07.900]  is very high in chlorine
[54:07.900 --> 54:09.900]  so you think that you're going
[54:09.900 --> 54:11.900]  to take it out of the water but then you're going to put it back in the
[54:11.900 --> 54:13.900]  dry amendments and chlorine itself
[54:13.900 --> 54:15.900]  in small amounts is actually extremely
[54:15.900 --> 54:17.900]  beneficial to the plant
[54:17.900 --> 54:19.900]  it contributes to the opening and closing
[54:19.900 --> 54:21.900]  of the stumbleness of
[54:21.900 --> 54:23.900]  the leaves which is the
[54:23.900 --> 54:25.900]  inhalation and exhalation of
[54:25.900 --> 54:27.900]  oxygen and
[54:27.900 --> 54:29.900]  carbon dioxide so
[54:29.900 --> 54:31.900]  chlorine itself in a
[54:31.900 --> 54:33.900]  small amount is
[54:33.900 --> 54:35.900]  actually extremely beneficial to the plant
[54:35.900 --> 54:37.900]  chlorine that's present in any tap water
[54:37.900 --> 54:39.900]  in any western civilization
[54:39.900 --> 54:41.900]  where you're able to drink the water without
[54:41.900 --> 54:43.900]  the chlorine making you ill or the water making
[54:43.900 --> 54:45.900]  you ill is perfectly
[54:45.900 --> 54:47.900]  okay to use
[54:47.900 --> 54:49.900]  and anybody that's selling a product like
[54:49.900 --> 54:51.900]  a dechlorination product or something
[54:51.900 --> 54:53.900]  that goes against that is
[54:53.900 --> 54:55.900]  purely and simply selling another product to
[54:55.900 --> 54:57.900]  extrapolate money from
[54:57.900 --> 54:59.900]  people like
[54:59.900 --> 55:01.900]  that
[55:29.900 --> 55:55.900]  and
[55:55.900 --> 55:57.900]  the
[55:57.900 --> 56:17.640]  if
[56:17.640 --> 56:21.560]  they ask me questions how to dial in their environment.
[56:21.560 --> 56:25.960]  Some of them haven't had a humidifier, I said it's important that you have a humidifier.
[56:25.960 --> 56:29.040]  You need to keep 60, 70% humidity throughout the vegetative state,
[56:29.040 --> 56:30.820]  otherwise your plant's gonna be suffering.
[56:30.820 --> 56:33.060]  Get a humidifier, control your temperature.
[56:34.680 --> 56:38.800]  As long as you've got that dialed in, the living soil's gonna work great for you.
[56:38.800 --> 56:41.800]  People do it, it's their second time, third time growing.
[56:41.800 --> 56:45.080]  They buy a bag of cocoa, they use the dry amendment with it, and
[56:45.080 --> 56:49.520]  they've got plants that are absolutely a pleasure to see.
[56:49.520 --> 56:54.680]  And I let everybody else do the talking for me.
[56:54.680 --> 56:57.520]  This isn't, I'm not saying things that are not backed up.
[56:57.520 --> 57:01.600]  I've got 14,500 followers and hundreds and
[57:01.600 --> 57:04.120]  hundreds of people that use the Dr. Organic Living Soil.
[57:04.120 --> 57:06.280]  And they'll all tell you the exact same thing.
[57:06.280 --> 57:09.280]  They have the best plant, the best growth,
[57:09.280 --> 57:14.720]  the best yields that they've ever had using it.
[57:15.720 --> 57:17.120]  And there's many other products out there, and
[57:17.120 --> 57:22.920]  they just don't get the same results, even if they do have the environment dialed in.
[57:22.920 --> 57:27.240]  So let me ask you this, I mean, there are so many things we've been touching on here.
[57:28.520 --> 57:32.920]  When you pour a glass of water, do you smell the chlorine?
[57:35.480 --> 57:40.480]  My water here, where I live, I don't smell the chlorine.
[57:40.480 --> 57:45.560]  I have been to other places in the UK where you can smell it a bit, but
[57:45.560 --> 57:50.160]  even at that level, I don't know in the United States what the level is.
[57:50.160 --> 57:52.120]  And I can only speak for the United Kingdom.
[57:52.120 --> 57:55.560]  So if you're in another country, I don't know what other people's water system is.
[57:55.560 --> 57:59.480]  But in the United Kingdom, from Scotland to Cornwall, that's the length and
[57:59.480 --> 58:01.240]  breadth of this country.
[58:01.240 --> 58:03.800]  Regardless of where you are, the pH level,
[58:03.800 --> 58:09.520]  the chlorine levels are all highly, highly regulated, okay?
[58:09.560 --> 58:11.600]  They're tested every single day.
[58:11.600 --> 58:15.960]  This is water that people are ingesting, and anything over, say,
[58:15.960 --> 58:20.400]  five parts per million is gonna give people an upset, and
[58:20.400 --> 58:22.960]  it's gonna have an impact on the human body.
[58:22.960 --> 58:27.400]  Before that water enters the water system in the United Kingdom,
[58:27.400 --> 58:32.240]  it is checked rigorously on a daily basis multiple times before it enters
[58:32.240 --> 58:33.840]  the pipes of people's homes.
[58:33.840 --> 58:39.280]  So no matter where you are in the UK, you're perfectly fine to use tap water.
[58:40.080 --> 58:42.280]  I know the United States does have good drinking water as well.
[58:43.440 --> 58:48.440]  It's pretty safe, and most people can just drink water out of their tap.
[58:48.440 --> 58:52.440]  I, on my actual drinking water, I put a filter on it.
[58:52.440 --> 58:56.360]  But the filter isn't to remove just the chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and
[58:56.360 --> 59:00.360]  other contaminants and
[59:00.360 --> 59:04.200]  bits that may be present in the pipes.
[59:04.200 --> 59:07.400]  And I don't really wanna be putting them in my body.
[59:07.400 --> 59:10.520]  But the plant and my body are two different things.
[59:10.520 --> 59:13.360]  And as much as I wanna give the plant the best I possibly can,
[59:13.360 --> 59:16.440]  I just wanna say to people that it's not necessary and
[59:16.440 --> 59:20.760]  it's not gonna make any difference to the overall health of the plant
[59:20.760 --> 59:24.160]  by just using the chlorine, using the tap water.
[59:24.160 --> 59:27.240]  Because the whole idea of to remove the chlorine,
[59:27.240 --> 59:32.880]  these agents that other companies sell, like dechlorinating agent,
[59:32.880 --> 59:36.000]  they don't say, you need to remove herbicides, pesticides, and
[59:36.040 --> 59:38.400]  all the other nasties that may be present in the water.
[59:38.400 --> 59:41.280]  They just focus primarily on just the chlorine,
[59:41.280 --> 59:43.840]  as the chlorine is the enemy that's gonna kill your plant.
[59:43.840 --> 59:46.280]  It doesn't kill your plant, and it never will kill your plant.
[59:46.280 --> 59:47.960]  UK tap water won't.
[59:47.960 --> 59:51.120]  I'm not sure about America, but I'm pretty certain and
[59:51.120 --> 59:56.920]  I'm pretty sure that the level of chlorine in American water,
[59:56.920 --> 01:00:00.800]  and through my research that I've done as well, it's got a good rating and
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:07.680]  it's classified as one of the safest waters in the Western world.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:12.240]  And you also talk about if you can smell it, chlorine, the smell of chlorine,
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:16.240]  it's extremely distinguishable to the human nose and
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.560]  we can smell it quite instantly.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.160]  You ever go and have a look at a swimming pool?
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.920]  A swimming pool has got a lot of chlorine and you can taste it, smell it.
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.640]  Yeah, very high levels of chlorine.
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:30.120]  Go and have a look at the grass around an outdoor swimming pool where people get
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.800]  out and the water has gone on the grass.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.440]  The grass that has been watered with swimming pool water will be twice the size
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.200]  of the edge of the swimming pool where it hasn't been watered.
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:45.360]  Like the chlorine in the water does not affect the plant.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:48.880]  It isn't at a higher level to actually have any detrimental impact.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.720]  If it was two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten times,
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.840]  I don't know what the actual thresholds would be.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.640]  Then it would have an impact on the plant.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:03.440]  The scientific data is there for people to look at and anecdotal evidence is here.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.520]  You know, 20 years I've been using UK water.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.640]  I've never dechlorinated it in my life and I've never had an issue, a problem,
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:17.000]  or a deficiency or a non-good growth pattern in 15 years.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.960]  So the UK water is most definitely safe to use.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:26.160]  The US, you're going to know better because you're out there drinking it and
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.040]  you know.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.240]  Yeah, you got that right.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:36.160]  And some areas are really nasty and other areas aren't so bad.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.320]  And it really depends on where you are in the supply chain.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.040]  So you're at the end of the pipe, you're going to tend to have a higher
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.160]  concentration than you are at the beginning, vice versa, depending, again,
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.720]  on the system.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:55.760]  Here, we do not test as stringently, I believe, as you probably do.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:02.000]  And to be quite honest, you know, when I did a recent study of COVID to just see
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:09.120]  what the water systems of America really look like, and I think it was like 85%
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:15.080]  of all water districts regularly fail their testing.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.080]  Microbial, chlorine, chloramine levels, and that's something we really didn't
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:24.280]  hit on, whether UK uses chloramine or just chlorine.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.960]  Because there is a difference between the two compounds.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.320]  But yeah, so we...
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:34.240]  Well, it's chloride and chlorine, but they're all...
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:39.520]  Like chlorine itself is only present naturally in like the deep centers,
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.520]  crust of the earth.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.520]  Apart from that, like it's not naturally present anywhere else.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.960]  But chlorine itself is present, but it's a gas, it's not a liquid.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:53.640]  So it has to be transformed into a liquid solution so it can be added to water.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:03:00.080]  And then one of the ions of it would be chloride.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.600]  And chloride is completely safe, like human beings need chloride as well.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.080]  But they're all derivatives of chlorine.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.920]  Like it can attach to near enough every other single element and become something else.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:20.080]  But chlorine in its pure form, which they do put into the tap water, you know,
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:23.800]  you wouldn't want to be fucking drinking that in its pure raw form.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:28.160]  But in the small amounts that's in there, like it's safe.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:28.720]  We've been...
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.080]  People live longer than they've ever lived in the whole of human history.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.200]  And they're all drinking, you know, we call it council estate tap water.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.960]  And you also have to look at the, you know, okay,
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:43.800]  dechlorinating your water before you feed your cannabis plants.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.360]  How many people dechlorinate their water before they water their plants outside
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.480]  in the back garden?
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.320]  No one does.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.000]  Are your plants in your back garden dead?
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:52.680]  No, they're not.
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:53.480]  Are they really thriving?
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.160]  Your roses, your begonias, your fuchsias, all of the plants,
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.640]  all outside in the garden, you use your garden hose.
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:00.880]  Oh, man, it's really hot there.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.920]  I need to water the plants.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.520]  You're not dechlorinating the water.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.720]  You're just using it straight out of the main tap in your water.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.560]  And then plants are flourishing.
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.200]  There's no deficiencies.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.440]  They're all growing vigorously overnight.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.560]  But how come all the plants in everybody's backyards, back gardens is completely fine?
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:20.760]  But the cannabis plant, a weed, a really hardy plant that's, you know,
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.080]  can stand the test of time.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.400]  What this particular plant out of all the other plants,
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.960]  you need to dechlorinate this one.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.000]  It's just marketing.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.840]  Kevin, listen, I'm not saying not to dechlorinate your water by using a filter.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.320]  I think that's a very wise thing to do.
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.280]  Put a filter on your main water supply.
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.200]  It costs 30 quid in the UK, $50 or whatever.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.720]  You change it once every six months, yeah?
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.280]  That's a good idea to do.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.240]  It takes away all the impurities and anything nasty.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.160]  Chlorine makes it smell and taste better.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.240]  I haven't got a problem with that.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:54.880]  But what I have a problem with is dechlorinating agents that other companies
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:59.560]  start selling, which if you want to buy a dechlorinating agent to dechlorinate your
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:04.280]  tap water before you give it to your cannabis plant, it was invented for fish
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.840]  tanks, the dechlorinating agent for fish tanks.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.520]  There's another form of dechlorination which is using vitamin C.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.640]  Vitamin C is, you know, you can buy a ton of it for a fiver and that would make up a
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:20.560]  trillion litres of dechlorination solution.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:26.440]  But companies are selling these products that, for one, are unnecessary,
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.960]  especially in the United Kingdom.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:31.280]  And secondly, they're selling it at such an astronomical price.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:37.760]  It's like 40, 50 pounds for a tiny little, you know, 250 millivites.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:43.680]  And then they want you to use one mil for every, you know, litre of water that you use.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.680]  Like, it's unnecessary.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.200]  You've just formulated that to make money from people.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.640]  Like, if you wanted to be honest and true with people, which I try and do, well,
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:56.320]  which I do all the time as a matter of fact, is to say, look, just buy a 30-pound
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.520]  filter and just put it on your filter line.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.880]  It takes five minutes to put it on there.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:03.960]  Like, you don't want to be adding chemicals to mask the effects of other chemicals.
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.640]  Like, if you want to remove the chemical, remove it.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:11.560]  Don't add an agent that masks the effects of it because it's still present.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.400]  It's still in the water.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:17.000]  Like, do you think that you drink a glass of water that's been dechlorinated with a
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  dechlorinating agent?
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.880]  So we put our tap under the water, we pull the lever down, we fill it up with water,
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:34.120]  and then we put one drop of dechlorination solution into that tap water before we drink it.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.040]  All those nasty compounds that are present are still there.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.600]  Well, you've just neutralized the effects of the chlorine, but you're still ingesting it.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.640]  It's still going through your system.
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:42.520]  You haven't taken it out of the water.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.480]  And it's the same with the plants.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:48.920]  Like, if you want to give it fresh water and you think the water isn't really that good,
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.520]  then just put a filter on.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:54.920]  But there's no money in selling filters to people because it costs 30 pound and they last a year.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:07:00.440]  But selling a solution to somebody in a bottle that costs 40 pounds and it cost you one pence to make it,
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:11.080]  and then all of the naive living soil growers or people that are leaning towards the living soil,
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.280]  you know, to use it, it's just a money-making scam.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.680]  And that's just what I don't like.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.160]  I don't like people being taken advantage of.
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:26.600]  And like I said before, in the cannabis industry, as it's dark and shady and murky and unregulated
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:32.840]  and illegal of all sense, these nutrient companies are just coming up with all these different products
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.640]  to try and increase their top line.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:35.880]  Oh, what can we bring out this year?
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:40.440]  Let's bring out some other bogus bullshit fucking nutrient that people will just lap up and buy.
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:45.280]  And then we're going to make another million pounds a year off the backs of these people's naivety.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:47.040]  Like, it's not increasing your yield.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.360]  It's not doing anything for you.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:50.040]  All it's doing is making these people...
[01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:55.040]  You have to understand and remember that any nutrient company that brings out any nutrient,
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.080]  they have not done it for the benefit of the end user.
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:01.760]  They haven't done it because it's going to be beneficial to you.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.920]  They've done it because it's going to be beneficial to them.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:04.920]  It's not necessary.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:05.840]  It's not needed.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:13.920]  It doesn't transgress the mandatory value of that product being used in per meter square of cannabis cultivation
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:19.280]  isn't going to increase the yield more than what that product costs you.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:23.120]  It's going to do absolutely nothing that you can visibly see, you know.
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:26.600]  But most people that grow, they grow different strains all the time.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:33.440]  So you can never get a true comparison to see, oh, did this product really increase my yield?
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.080]  And they know this.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.120]  Like, people grow one strain, they grow another strain.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.000]  They do it from seed.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.200]  Everything yields differently.
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.600]  You know, they know that people are not...
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:47.200]  You know, they could have low stress trained it differently and it may not have had as many tops as your last one.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.080]  And it may...
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.440]  It will, you know, average between 40 and 50 grams.
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.560]  The nutrient companies know this.
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.080]  They've got...
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:59.000]  They spend millions of pounds on marketing and, you know, human psychology and how to sell things.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.160]  Like, the whole...
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:06.080]  What nutrient companies do in the cannabis community is to sell products to make money.
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:11.920]  If you go into garden centers, if you go into nurseries, if you go into, you know, flower...
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:16.360]  We just say garden centers and nurseries because they're the main two that are going to be selling plants.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:23.720]  They're not selling dechlorination and pH down and pH up and super sticky and all of these things to make your cucumbers.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:31.400]  Why do you think that the producers of all of our crops, you know, the food that we consume,
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:36.000]  whether it's in the United States or America or any of the other countries, why are they not using Dutch Pro?
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.960]  Why are they not using all these nutrients?
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:46.320]  You know, why don't they use the same nutrients that are supposed to achieve these exponential yields and growth?
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:50.680]  Why do the allotmentists not use it for their champion, you know, vegetables?
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:54.120]  And like, why is it only the cannabis community?
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:10:04.760]  Because the cannabis community has been lied to and manipulated by clever marketing from nutrient companies for the past 20 years.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:13.160]  But just take yourself out and just look at other industries that grow fruits, vegetables and flowers or whatever else it may be.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.880]  No other industry does this.
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.120]  It wouldn't be tolerated in any industry.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:25.640]  You couldn't go into a garden center and start selling these products to people at astronomical prices for people that are growing fruits and vegetables or whatever,
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:27.160]  because it's unethical. It's not right.
[01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.280]  It's you know, that's why it doesn't happen.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:40.960]  It only happens in the cannabis in a cannabis world because people have been suckered in and the nutrient companies are making massive amounts of money.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:46.440]  You know, if you're spot on about that and it's it's the dilution that kills you.
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:55.440]  I mean, you know, we laugh about it as the cannabis tax because people think cannabis growers make so much money.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.640]  And in the past they did make a lot of money.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:02.600]  Yeah. So they were penalized for that by the nutrient companies.
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:11.960]  All that nutrient is is the same NPK that the farmer uses just that time or a hundred times the price and lose ten times.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:20.880]  So it's yeah, you're absolutely right about kind of shaking people up about the fact that you're getting raped.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:31.720]  I mean, you can go to the garden center and buy a bag of NPK and that'll last you 10, 15 grows if you want to grow something.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:43.280]  But for whatever reason, you know, people just don't get that you can find the same thing in all industries for a tenth or a hundredth of the price.
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:52.800]  And so these conversations not to insert, interrupt you, these conversations before social media, YouTube and Instagram.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:59.080]  They've never collectively people have never had these conversations and they haven't had platforms and videos that they can go back to,
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:13.400]  like the one that we're doing now where people can listen to the discussion and have information and insights brought to light that they otherwise didn't know beforehand.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:18.680]  Before the work, the worlds of technology, all of this information wasn't really spoken about.
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:35.400]  And everyone was just so lost in the whole, you know, shading us of growing a bit of marijuana that the actual real true science behind growing the cannabis plant has been completely lost.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.920]  And the and the nutrient companies are capitalized from it.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:41.640]  And I've said, look, we live we're living in the age of twenty, twenty two now.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:47.480]  Hundreds of years ago, we used to burn people at the state because we thought they were witches because of the lack of education.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.440]  But everybody has a mobile device in their hand for at least 10 hours a day.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.320]  And we've got so much information readily available.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.920]  We don't have to go to library. We don't have to pick up the encyclopedia.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.720]  We can just type in Google. What is the capital of this?
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.120]  What is the purpose of this is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:12.400]  And all this information, this huge tsunami of information that's flooding our brains on a daily basis.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:17.120]  It was never available. The human mind never had so much information at one time.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:26.080]  And all of not just nutrient companies, but many other companies that have also extorted the end user for their own gain.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.080]  The world, the world, as we know it, is changing and is coming to an end.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:42.320]  And there will be a dawn of. A new a new, you know, whether it's so sorry, a new dawn of
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:51.760]  mankind and the age of information that is going to relinquish people from the grip and the hold.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:59.840]  That has they've had over them from so many different industries because they're able to free themselves with this wealth of knowledge,
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:07.040]  if that makes any sense, like it's the it's it's a very technology is a very wonderful, wonderful thing.
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:15.120]  And it brings so many people together. But at the same time, it's educated people to such a degree that people are going to won't be taken advantage of for much longer.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.240]  I agree with you 100 percent on that.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:26.960]  The Internet has provided the ability for people that are not so well educated to become educated.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.600]  And I think that's why Brian and I do this.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:42.960]  From hitting the bro science that flows out of a lot of these podcasts or forums that used to be
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:51.120]  mainstream for getting this kind of information. So, yeah, and I agree with you in the essence that
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:59.760]  there will be a more of an awakening as people are becoming more aware of the fact that
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:06.080]  the Federal Reserve is even part of our government. It's a group of very wealthy people that control money
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:14.880]  around the globe and shit like that. You know, we we have a term over here called woke. Right.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:22.640]  And originally the term was used. It meant that this person has now become aware that there is a
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:30.880]  lot of money around. Recently, it has been reprocessed or repurposed, spoiled white,
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:40.560]  spoiled white titled people. And, you know, again, this is the media twisting our own words
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:48.000]  and taking advantage of it and making fun of people so they don't want to be woke. And it's
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:55.920]  because, you know, anybody with a little bit of intelligence can really deep dive into information
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:04.400]  that that will open their eyes. I've been basically hoodwinked for the whole life into
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:10.160]  believing certain things are legitimate and real. I mean, I remember having a conversation with my
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:14.720]  father about Wall Street. I said, Dad, Wall Street's a den of fucking thieves. There's no
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:20.000]  value in these companies anymore. Originally, when it was set up, you bought a stock,
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:28.000]  support a company to help them grow and bring more products that you like to market. That has
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:35.120]  been so from the truth at this point in time, it's not even funny. It's a gamble. It's not. It
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:40.880]  has nothing to do with the value of the company. And if you invest in it, that investment is not
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:47.520]  directly going toward fueling R&D or bringing better products that last longer to market.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:53.760]  It's about fueling cheaper ways to make the product so that they can sell you more after
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:17:01.120]  the first one fucking breaks. So, yeah, there's there is a lot of shit that's just not fucking
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:08.560]  right about what humans have done to other humans, all in the name of making more fucking money.
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:13.600]  And, you know, you got to wonder at some point, even even these billionaires got to wake up and go,
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:20.880]  I just killed myself my whole life to achieve this love benchmark of being a billionaire.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.720]  I can never spend that money in my life. What the fuck did I do?
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:30.720]  And so let me build you some libraries, monuments in my name so you never forget.
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.640]  You still didn't win the fucking game, dude, you're dead.
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:42.160]  But anyway, that's so far off topic. Let's let's reel it back in and talk some more about
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:49.360]  living soils. I wanted to I wanted to kind of I wanted to dive deeper into Dr. Organics when he's
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:56.560]  talking about living soil. So there's people use that term here in America. It usually is kind of
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:01.200]  defined in different ways because you had mentioned that you'd never seen any benefits from using
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:07.920]  microbes and that things are building up. And I was wondering, you know, how deep is your microbial
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:13.120]  populations? Are you using composting worms and rove beetles and decomposers? I just wanted to
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.360]  kind of break that down more and unpack more of what you're doing to build your soil system.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:22.720]  Yeah, so the soil, the soil that we sell, like fifty five liter bags of
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:30.800]  organic living soil that has gone through the process of full decomposition.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:41.360]  All of the dry amendments that have been added have been broken down over three or four weeks
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:48.720]  and then it's turned worm castings and other accelerators that are used in the process. We have
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:54.640]  you know, vats that hold around 10,000 liters of soil. So there's an extreme amount of heat that
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:59.760]  is produced and that activates everything. And then after the cooling process is taken,
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:05.760]  it's then bagged and the bags. We try and have a level of stock, always like a month supply of
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:11.040]  stock in advance. So the bags usually sit for at least another four weeks after that complete
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:17.280]  process before they go out to the end users. So when the end users buy the soil and they empty it
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:28.800]  into the pot, then the whole process has already taken place before it's bagged and gone to
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:39.760]  the customers. And then I always say like you can just add the dry amendment to recharge the soil
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:46.640]  and grow in it again straight away. Preferably, you know, it'd be an idea to use around 10, 15%
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:53.520]  water. So if you're using like a 30 liter pot, add three, three and a half liters of water
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:58.640]  to get a good level of moisture throughout the soil and then cover it for seven to 10 days
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:03.040]  before you use it. And it gives chance for everything to start breaking down
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:07.360]  before you put your plant in there. Most people, you know, they have a smaller tent where they're
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:13.040]  vegging and they can do that process. Or ideally, if you've got a compost bin, you can recharge,
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:18.160]  reamend the soil. If you've got any other compost or worm castings or something, you know, that you
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.960]  want to add and mix through it, put it into your compost bin with all the roots. The dying and
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:32.000]  decaying roots are also promote experimental amounts of microbial life and then alternate
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.680]  between two batches of soil. So the norm is to buy soil, use it and then throw it away and
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:42.800]  people will throw it in their garden or they'll throw it in the woods or throw it wherever they can.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:47.440]  They go to the hydroponic store and then they'll buy another bag of soil and a load of nutrients
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:52.240]  and their, you know, the cycle will continue again. And when that's done, they'll throw that away.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:59.040]  So you only need to buy the soil once or buy two batches of soil, have a composter and just
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:04.080]  alternate between the two batches of soil. And most grows, you know, people were doing two to
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:09.280]  four weeks veg and eight to nine weeks flowering. So even if you say the latter of the two, you know,
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:15.680]  at least 10 weeks worth of growing. So if you've got a compost bin and you've just brought 500
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:20.800]  litres of Dr. Organic's Living Soil to grow in whatever space you've got, once that's done,
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:27.200]  you harvest the plant, just rip the main root knuckle out, reamend the soil
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:33.040]  and then add it to your compost bin and give it a watering and then let it do its thing for three
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:38.320]  months, get another batch of Dr. Organic's and grow in that. And then by the time that the next
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:43.600]  harvest is ready, the old soil that you've used in your compost bin has been composting down.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:49.680]  If you want to throw any organic waste in there and you know that you've got enough time for it
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:56.320]  to break down completely, then do so or have a separate bin with, you know, organic waste
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:01.520]  breaking down in that with the use as an accelerator that can be mixed through and
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:07.840]  added through another stage. But the main thing that I just say to people is ideally just have
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:12.320]  two batches of soil in a compost bin and then all you're ever doing is just buying the dry amendment
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:17.920]  to recharge the soil and it's going to go through the process for three months of breaking down
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:22.880]  and, you know, all the root matter will be broken down, that will be turned back into
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:28.080]  a soil and compost and after that three months it will come out of the compost bin
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:35.600]  and looking brand new again and full of microbial life ready to grow your plant on your next run. So
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:42.480]  it's very, very cheap for people to grow that way. And this is another reason why in the UK,
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:48.320]  in the UK as well, I'm not sure in the US, but you know, I know a lot of people in a lot of
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:52.880]  places in the US, you have the manufacturer and the manufacturer will send to sell to the
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:57.920]  to the end user. But in the United Kingdom you have a manufacturer, the manufacturer sells to
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:03.200]  a wholesaler and then the wholesaler will sell to or sometimes even a distributor and the
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.880]  distributor to the wholesaler, then the wholesaler will send it to the shop, sell it to the shop,
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:11.440]  i.e. the hydroponic shop. Then the hydroponic shop, you know, everyone has to pay VAT and put their
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:17.520]  markup along the way and by the time it gets to the end user, the actual true cost of the product
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:22.240]  is a pound. By the time it gets to the end user is 50 pound. So the end user is always the one who
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:28.400]  suffers because of the way that thing business has been formulated in the United Kingdom. So it's
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:32.720]  never to benefit the end user, it's just to make, you know, businesses and make people rich. Well,
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:38.160]  we just produce our product and we just sell it to the end user. Like we don't give it out to
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:43.920]  hydroponic stores, we don't wholesale it to anyone, like everything we do is handmade,
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.960]  handcrafted, there's no machinery involved, like our blood, sweat and tears and back breaking,
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:56.960]  raking and shoveling and mixing and barrowing work goes into this. Like we haven't got it on
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:01.440]  an industrial level where we're, like we produce like a lot of soil, like we probably sell maybe,
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.720]  well I don't even want to say how much we sell because other people will listen to it,
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:07.920]  competitors maybe, they'll be like, oh my god, he's selling that much. But we sell a lot of soil
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:16.240]  anyway and we don't want to change the way that we're making the soil because then we have to
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:23.600]  start bringing machinery in and it just takes away from what it is. And like doing everything
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:30.480]  handmade, it's just so, even the way that like it's mixed, like we're mixing it and when you're
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.920]  raking it and you're mixing everything by hand instead of using machinery, it just adds a
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.360]  different dimension and it just feels different and it just looks different. And we do them in
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:42.880]  small batches so everything's really consistent. When you start upscaling and do things in large
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:47.440]  batches, like the mixing process, it might not get evenly distributed and people start cutting
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:53.280]  corners and then it starts to become about money and for us it's just like, I love to make it and
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:59.360]  that's just my passion and each and every single bag is like hand bagged and hand sealed and hand
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:06.160]  packed and everything is done by hand. So there's, we don't have any machines apart from like mixing
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:11.040]  machines to mix up our dry amendments because it can get a little bit dusty but apart from that we
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:18.160]  do, we do everything by hand you know. So you don't recommend using compost extracts to
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.560]  increase the microbial's ability to break down those dry amendments?
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:29.120]  I wouldn't say not recommend to use it but I've just found, I try, what I've tried to do is I've
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:37.520]  tried to be as basic as I possibly can and offer something that works exceptionally well and
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:43.280]  you know, if I was to add some sort of compost accelerator or something to this soil,
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:48.400]  in relation to is it going to make the plant grow any quicker, better or yield anymore, no it's not.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:56.320]  Like the level, the amount of time that we go through to actually let everything break down
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:05.520]  and become available within the soil, because what would happen sorry, is that if we've done
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:09.200]  that then it means that we have to start selling more products to people. Oh yeah, you know you
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:14.480]  can buy this compost accelerator etc. Like we don't want to be selling other products to people
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:19.040]  and if we don't, if we say to people that they're needed then you know people think, oh I need to
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:23.520]  do that to make it better and I'm trying to say to people that, like if you have your own sort of
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:28.080]  compost accelerator in your garden and you've got something sitting over in a bucket for a long time
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:34.080]  that's you know, been breaking down and you want to add that and run it through in your compost bin
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:38.880]  when you've recharged with the dry amendment on your next run, then certainly go ahead and do that.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:43.120]  But I don't want to advocate people going out and buying other unnecessary products that
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:50.560]  you know, massively marked up prices, which in terms of you spend 20-30 pounds on a product and
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:56.160]  you add it to the soil, is that 20-30 pounds going to transgress into a better plant or a more
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:02.400]  productive plant? The answer is no it's not. That 20-30 pounds is going to do nothing in terms of
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:09.520]  mandatory value of increasing crop production or you know, you leave all the dry amendment
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:14.880]  in the soil and all the decaying, dying roots for three months and you maintain a decent level of
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:21.200]  moisture throughout those three months. That's more than ample enough time for everything to
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:29.280]  become you know, bioavailable and be broken down to a very, very high degree and for the plant to flourish.
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:34.960]  And I just think like sometimes it's just unnecessary to keep adding things like, like where
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:39.120]  do you stop? Like you just want to keep adding more and more and more, make something better and better
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:46.320]  like it's, it's, it's, it's as good as it can be and just like adding something else to it. I'm not
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:50.480]  saying that it's, if you can add it for free yeah and it's got something you've got in your garden
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:57.200]  then go ahead and put it in there. But it's not gonna, it's not gonna achieve the process any
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:02.320]  quicker and it's definitely not going to give you like a better result or something in the long term.
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:09.920]  Now when we're talking about the, the microbial world, from what I'm listening from you though,
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:16.080]  your view is a little bit different. So you don't have composting worms and more of like
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:23.680]  the decomposers within that system, correct? Yeah. So when you say that there is no benefit to the
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:28.080]  microbial world, like when things build up, I just want our viewers to understand that
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.280]  you know, your, your viewpoint on a living, when you were saying living soil is maybe a little bit
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:38.960]  different than the way we define it. Because when we are using decomposers, I can say from my
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:46.080]  personal experience, there's a dramatic increase as the soil system begins to come alive and thriving.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:53.200]  What I want to say is what level of microbial activity do you think needs to be achieved before
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:59.760]  any more microbial activity on top of that already existing level is not going to benefit
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:05.200]  the plant whatsoever? Because we have to remember is if you've got, say the threshold for optimum
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:10.240]  level of microbial activity is a hundred trillion microbes, for instance, okay. And that level of
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:16.080]  microbial activity is breaking down the amendments and all the organic matter and in turn feeding the
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:23.040]  plant to its optimal level of its genetic expression. So genetically it wants to absorb
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:28.240]  X amount of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and other trace elements, vitamins, nutrients that are
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:33.120]  bioavailable in the soil at that time. If you therefore add another a hundred trillion microbes
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:38.880]  to that soil, that a hundred trillion microbes that you've added, it can't make the plant grow
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:47.680]  any quicker or absorb any nutrients at a faster rate than what that plant genetically deems it
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:52.560]  needs to uptake already, because then you'd be overfeeding the plant. And with organic living
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:57.360]  soil, you can't overfeed the plant. You're not using synthetic fertilizers that are being
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.880]  administered directly to the root system. The living soil is an abundance of food that's being
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:11.680]  laid out within the root system. And when the plant needs a particular NPK or whatever it may be,
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:15.680]  as long as it's there for the plant, as long as it's there for the root system to absorb
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:23.840]  on demand of the plant, then adding more microbial life isn't going to benefit the plant. Because
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:28.400]  if that was the case, and every time you added more microbial life, the plant got bigger and
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:34.240]  bigger and bigger and could grow more and more vigorously, then there would never be a level
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:39.520]  which you couldn't go beyond. You have to reach a point where the optimum level of microbial life
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:44.560]  has been achieved. Anything that you put on top of that, all of those trillions of microbes-
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:49.840]  I think that's where we might, I think that's where we have, so from what I understand in other
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:54.000]  individuals, more like the commercial level, when you're farming cannabis as quick as you are,
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:31:00.320]  in a regen mindset, you're never going to be able to achieve that. You're never going to be able to
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:05.040]  get the optimal microbial life because everything is completely changing every time. You're disturbing
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:11.040]  things too often. And when you're using decomposers, I think that's also maybe that secret
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:16.240]  ignition switch that allows that diversity to really come through and shine for you. So
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:21.760]  I would say to you, just if you're really into experimenting, play around with that. If you have
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:27.040]  an awesome base soil, like you're explaining to the audience, adding composting worms, adding
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:31.600]  springtails, adding isopods, adding a variety of different things that are going to break down
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:36.880]  organic matter a little bit quicker, will definitely improve that soil system over time.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:43.040]  No, I wouldn't disagree with you and say it's not because you're replicating nature to the best of
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.600]  its capability. And you can't turn around and say that adding worms and doing these things aren't
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:52.080]  going to be beneficial. But in the scientific basis of things, of what I try and be clear to
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:58.480]  people is, is that if the level of microbial activity has been enriched, like the question
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:04.000]  I put to you is, okay, let's say that we take a soil sample and the soil sample contains a trillion
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:10.080]  microbes, okay? And the optimum level, the absolute peak threshold of microbial activity present
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:15.760]  within the soil that has reached the threshold of breakdown is a million, let's just say for
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:20.960]  argument's sake, a million microbes, okay? So we've taken a soil sample and that soil has a
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:26.800]  million microbes per inch of soil, or whatever you want to do, just hypothetically speaking.
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:31.600]  And a scientist says, you're right, the optimum level of microbial activity has been achieved.
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:37.520]  You can add as much more microbial activity as you want. It makes absolutely no bearing in the
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:44.560]  overall growth or production of that plant because it physically cannot absorb any more nutrients.
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:50.400]  The microbial life is there to break down the amendments and within those amendments,
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:56.080]  NPK becomes available to the plant. So as long as that optimum level of NPK becomes available to the
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:05.120]  plant, you've already reached the main threshold of what is needed to achieve the yield.
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:10.400]  It's all very nice and lovely to add more things and be involved in nature and put worms in
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:19.600]  and do all these sorts of things. And it's more of a connection with the soil and earth and
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:25.520]  replicating things as well as we can and bringing nature into the garden. But the scientific data
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:30.400]  and any scientist's work, they sort of tell you that once the threshold of microbial activity
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:38.320]  has been reached, any extra microbial activity that you add to it offers no benefit to the plant
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:46.480]  whatsoever. There is a threshold that is achieved and unless you get your soil tested,
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:52.800]  you know, not to be argumentative but to say, oh we're disrupting the soil and we're not leaving
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:57.680]  it long enough time, like none of us are continuously taking samples of our soil. I doubt
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:02.800]  that anyone has actually ever taken a sample of their living soil and send it off to a laboratory
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:09.120]  to be tested and said, you know, is my optimal level of microbial activity within this soil
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:17.520]  present? You know, is it at a level, an optimal level? And you'd be surprised of like
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:24.000]  the level of microbes, like you know the exponential rate of 10 to the power of microbial
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:35.120]  reproductivity, that the microbial population will reach a level where it physically can't
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:42.480]  gain, it can't go above already what it's reached, it's reached its threshold. So a lot of people are
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:47.360]  adding stuff in and this is the thing is you can always add too much. You can always, always,
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:52.240]  always, always put too much. You can put too much nutrition, you can put too much in a plant.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:58.880]  And what I also try and do is that when you're adding massive amounts of nutrition to a plant
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:05.760]  and a soil, you know, say for instance you're using a 30 litre pot, you don't want high levels
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.400]  of nutrients to be available at the end of flowering. You want the soil to become somewhat
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:18.960]  depleted and encourage its natural process of absorption and cut off from the root system
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:24.480]  and energy expenditure going into the upper canopy and the autumnal colours and the
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:31.280]  cannibalistic nature of the plant to then start eating itself in order to produce
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.840]  the flowers. And then it's different, like I say, regenerating the soil, that after that process
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:43.920]  has taken place, that soil is going to be somewhat less, well a lot less fertile than what it would
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:48.640]  have been when you started off. And that's why I say like the best option is to go between a
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:54.400]  composter and add that soil into a composter with the dry amendments and other organic matter, worm
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:59.920]  castings etc. And the threshold of microbial activity would be achieved within three or four
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:04.960]  weeks. Like nature is not stupid and don't think that it takes three months or four months and you
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:13.120]  have to keep adding and keep giving more stuff. Like nature is an extraordinary thing and it is
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:20.240]  extremely efficient at reaching the level that it needs to reach in very very quick time.
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:28.000]  So not to disagree, as I said like adding all these things, yeah it's good to become
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:35.920]  try and become part of nature and part of the soil. But if you want to talk about productivity
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:40.400]  of a plant and when can I use the soil again to achieve the same amount of yield that I could
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:46.880]  the first time. I know a lot of people are of the understanding that I need to, you know the
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:55.760]  second time round or the third or the fourth time round. I can get some Dr Organics Living Soil that
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:04.000]  has gone through like a six month process of decomposition and amendment breakdown and heat
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.280]  depletion and bagging etc. You know six months from beginning to end and I could get another
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:15.680]  bag of Dr Organics Living Soil and reamend it with the amendments and worm castings and put it
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:22.400]  in a composter for four weeks and I can guarantee you that there would be absolutely zero difference
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:27.120]  in growth rate and productivity of the plant. And like I have done that on countless countless
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:35.280]  countless times to see like how long without testing the soil, how long is actually needed
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:41.120]  for the breakdown of all these organic components until this plant can thrive and
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.440]  not be out competed by some soil that's been left any longer. Like you understand what I'm saying
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:55.520]  like is it six months is it three months there is a time that will be reached where the optimal level
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:02.320]  of nutrition beneficial bacterias and microbial population has been achieved. And if you look
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:07.920]  into the scientific data of things the growth of microbial activity that level was achieved
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:15.680]  very very very very very very quickly. So people would be surprised to learn that it's not as long
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:23.360]  as you think is needed for the living soil. And I know say like the definition of living soil like
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:28.400]  the definition of one person's living soil to another living soil is if you don't have worms
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:32.160]  and you don't have this and that then it's not a living soil. Well there's lots of soil that's
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:40.320]  present amongst the planet where these worms and that aren't present they don't exist and there's
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:48.320]  other creatures that are more prevalent within the soil than others. So all living soils from
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:56.800]  all different regions is all is all different and in its own right it's all called it would
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:02.640]  all be called living soil. The fact of the very name living soil is the soil is living. So if you
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:08.400]  have a soil that is living and it's full of microbial activity then the soil is living
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:12.320]  regardless of whether it's got worms or anything else in the very definition of living is something
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:17.360]  that is alive and if your soil is alive and it contains an abundant population of microbial life
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:22.480]  like by the very definition of that then that is a living soil like in my own opinion.
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:29.200]  Yeah I would define it as though it's a living soil is always improving. That's why I think
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:34.880]  I'm gonna let Layton kind of talk on that because he's definitely more qualified to talk about some
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:38.560]  of that stuff because some of the things that's what I like about the show some of the things
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:41.920]  you've mentioned you know I have a different viewpoint.
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:49.840]  I think that's the whole purpose of this show is to you know showcase other people's successes
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.280]  and you know I get what you're saying dude like you know there is a certain point where
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:07.920]  you can't put any more in it right. It's achieved its maximum potential but that being said we
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:18.480]  know for sure that especially the bacteria move in and out of the system. They change during
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:24.080]  seasons, they change during wet periods and dry periods and personally I love what you talked
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:29.760]  about earlier about letting the soil actually dry back a little bit. There's a gentleman Alex who
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:35.920]  will be coming up at some point on the show to talk about his work in crop science and
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:42.800]  water only. So he will go through wet periods kind of like the nature you know you get a rain
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:48.000]  shower you get a tunnel water then another shower for a period of time or maybe you go through a
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.880]  spring or a fall where it's very wet for a month or two and then it dries out for the summer.
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:41:00.880]  There's a lot of information that indicates that this type of watering is very beneficial
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:07.120]  this type of watering is very beneficial but what happens during this is you're shifting your
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:14.000]  microbial community. So the fungus we know stays pretty much the same throughout the course of the
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.800]  year and during these different periods or seasonal changes but the bacterial community
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:26.400]  changes radically and so you know in that regard even though you're in a controlled environment
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:32.800]  where you basically don't have these seasonal issues or perhaps you do have some watering
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:40.240]  variations then you may be losing some degree of diversity. So when I asked you that question
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:50.240]  about encouraging people to use compost extracts it was really just to encourage that soil system
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:58.160]  to remain at peak performance throughout the course of the growth. And so what we've found is
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:04.880]  you know over the years out here in the you know in the hippie grows in NorCal before camp was that
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:11.920]  those using those dry amendments and then adding a microbial contingency or contingency to just
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:20.880]  encourage those breakdowns was very beneficial and it didn't it didn't mobilize the nutrients
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:27.440]  so when I say mobilize I mean make it water soluble so the water washes through the soil.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:34.240]  The microbes actually consume those and then you know obviously create biofilm and so that
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:40.800]  those nutrients were stored in the soil aggregates which again are really really
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:46.720]  important on so many levels whether it's redox whether it's... Sorry to interrupt you I just
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:53.280]  got asked does your soil that you use do you guys use peat out there and coco coir and a different
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:43:00.240]  mixture? We call those soilless mediums so there's soil and then there's soilless mediums.
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:07.600]  If it is truly soil then it has to have sand silt in place. Yeah yeah. In my mind you know
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:16.160]  other people may argue about that but bottom line is I put forward suggestions in the canvas
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:22.000]  community a number of years ago to use a horizontal soil system in other words mimic nature.
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:32.720]  So nature makes these layers due to what's called transportation so I think it's like 80 or 90
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:41.280]  percent of all soils on this planet happen through transportation so wind erosion water
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:48.560]  those types of activities so you know in a horizontal soil system you have a layer of
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:54.160]  sand and rocks at the bottom which acts as a aquifer then you have a transitional layer that
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:44:00.320]  has sand silt and organic matter which acts as heart and lungs and then the top layer the over
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:09.200]  is a soil as medium so that you have fast rooting fast what I want to call advanced
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:18.320]  air exchange and ability to accept or drain moisture water or nutrients or something to
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:24.480]  hold the nutrients in place. So that's kind of just a quick brush down on the way we view
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:32.560]  soil versus soil. So I hope I answered your question. Yeah yeah definitely because this
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:40.800]  the actual soil that we produce our own living soil it is made up of around 50 percent cocoa
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:47.360]  core 35 percent compost and five percent worm castings perlite for aeration we want to use
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:54.880]  a different substitute to that later on but it's just like financial constraints of being
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:45:01.920]  able to get something cost effective that we can still produce the soil and so when you talk about
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:08.640]  like a compost accelerator our compost there's imagine you've got 50 you've got 100 liters so
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:16.480]  you've got 50 liters of cocoa core you've got 35 liters of our own compost that we make from
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:28.400]  browns and greens and forest material that's been decomposing in vats for around 12 months we've got
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:34.160]  10 10 000 liter vats and they're always being topped up so by the time it actually comes out
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:40.560]  at the bottom it's around you know 9 to 12 months old and that's enabling us to supply the level of
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:45.120]  soil that is on demand at the moment with the vats that we have we're going to put some more in as the
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:50.240]  demand goes up and then once all those dry amendments the compost the worm castings of
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:56.800]  perlite and the cocoa core has all been mixed together then that is left again for another
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:03.040]  month and turned to distribute the heat before it is then bagged and then it is bagged so the whole
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:10.080]  process like the compost is like 12 months in the making then the whole breakdown process is like
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:14.800]  another month and then they're left in a bag for another month before the end user uses them in our
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:25.200]  stockpile so like it's gone through a long process before the soil that we sell is distributed that
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:32.720]  that goes out to the end user so like I know some people like use a compost accelerator but
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:43.920]  we've got 35 liters per 100 liters of our own microbial rich stinking compost that is added
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:52.560]  to the soil medium which is full of beneficial bacteria and trillions upon trillions of
[01:46:56.730 --> 01:47:03.610]  sorry just one second of my trillions and trillions of microbes and then it's going for a process of
[01:47:03.610 --> 01:47:08.170]  where it's being you know broken down and then the dry amendments are being added to it so then all
[01:47:08.170 --> 01:47:14.490]  the worm the worm castings and the insect frass and the alfalfa meal and the bone meal and all of
[01:47:14.490 --> 01:47:18.810]  that goes through another month's worth of breakdown within that compost and coca gore and
[01:47:18.810 --> 01:47:23.770]  then it's sat again when it's bagged in its individual 55 liter bags and it's sat again for
[01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:34.330]  another minimum of four weeks in a in a warm room which we have that's kept at around 20 20 degrees
[01:47:34.330 --> 01:47:40.170]  so it's always nice and warm with a with a correct moisture level throughout the bags and then
[01:47:40.170 --> 01:47:45.290]  they're sealed in the bags from from that point and then they go for another month of of breaking
[01:47:45.290 --> 01:47:50.890]  down so when people get the soil the first soil that they have like it's gone through
[01:47:51.610 --> 01:47:58.490]  an extraordinary process to um from from the beginning to the end you know
[01:48:00.810 --> 01:48:07.530]  yeah so we would definitely call you a soilless medium and what we what you describe as the
[01:48:07.610 --> 01:48:13.850]  process where the nutrients or the raw amendments break down we would call that a cooking off so
[01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:20.250]  that those basically you're you're again you're using thermophilic bacteria to break those
[01:48:20.250 --> 01:48:27.690]  amendments down and store them in their body and in biofilm to later be available for the
[01:48:27.690 --> 01:48:35.850]  protozoa to consume or graze on when this is running so yeah so in the chat a couple people
[01:48:35.850 --> 01:48:42.410]  have asked have you ever microscoped your your end product or had it sent off to a soil food
[01:48:42.410 --> 01:48:48.650]  lab to to determine what microbial level um you have actually achieved if i'm completely honest
[01:48:48.650 --> 01:48:55.130]  i've put it under a microscope but i've never actually um i've never sent it off because well
[01:48:55.130 --> 01:49:01.210]  i should have it sent off because out of pure curiosity just to know what is present and you
[01:49:01.210 --> 01:49:07.290]  know why it works so well and achieves such great results whatever it is is present in it at
[01:49:07.290 --> 01:49:12.970]  its particular time of completion um put it under the microscope and you know i'm not a scientist
[01:49:12.970 --> 01:49:18.090]  and i can't identify what things are but there's an absolute abundance of of life within there
[01:49:18.730 --> 01:49:25.290]  um but no i haven't i haven't sent anything off um but it would definitely be something that i
[01:49:25.370 --> 01:49:30.890]  will be doing in the near future yeah it's just always nice to have some kind of baseline and
[01:49:31.450 --> 01:49:39.290]  and not that not that the testing is actually an end-all be-all because you know i'll talk
[01:49:39.290 --> 01:49:44.570]  about this and i have spoken about it many times is that when you're doing a micro
[01:49:47.210 --> 01:49:53.370]  where you're actually scoping it um the human influence can have dramatic effect in other words
[01:49:53.370 --> 01:49:56.730]  if you're in a good mood you're going to see all good things if you're in a bad mood you're going
[01:49:56.730 --> 01:50:02.810]  to see negative things and that that has been documented and so this is again why we need a
[01:50:02.810 --> 01:50:11.770]  you know ai or a program that will identify the the organisms in a more suitable uh manner the
[01:50:11.770 --> 01:50:22.570]  human humans make mistakes all the time so so that being said the uh the end result of uh microbial
[01:50:22.570 --> 01:50:31.610]  testing um is to achieve what's called a pounds of nitrogen cycles per 90 days
[01:50:32.490 --> 01:50:40.490]  and so that scale is basically zero to 300. yeah over 300 we don't know in other words that's
[01:50:41.210 --> 01:50:47.370]  there's more there's obviously more that can happen but we don't have the ability to test
[01:50:47.370 --> 01:50:52.250]  beyond that level so it there's a lot of again there's a lot of restraints or
[01:50:54.250 --> 01:51:03.530]  inability to really process what is happening and again this is a snapshot in time a pinprick
[01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:10.170]  of what the fuck is really going on in that system and it doesn't include the biogeochemical reactions
[01:51:10.170 --> 01:51:17.290]  that are happening seconds before and after you took that snapshot time so it's it's not a great
[01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:24.890]  tool but it is a tool you know so it gives you something to to try to understand and i heard you
[01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:31.930]  mentioned um forest stuff so you're adding his forest stuff to us in the fungal communities
[01:51:33.850 --> 01:51:40.410]  say that again sorry um so i heard you mentioned that you like to use forest stuff in your in your
[01:51:40.410 --> 01:51:46.010]  soil production so yeah that's to bring in the microbial communities the the sap robes
[01:51:46.890 --> 01:51:54.650]  yeah that's right so we've got a boundary of forest on some of the farmland and we you know
[01:51:54.650 --> 01:52:00.250]  the the forest is say it's a forest it's not it's a woodland area so it's not a massive forest but
[01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:05.130]  you know forest and a woodland the definition of the two it's the material that's contained
[01:52:06.170 --> 01:52:10.970]  on the forest floor we incorporate a proportion of that from the land into
[01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:18.410]  um into the soil for all the benefits that it gives and i say to people as well like i've said
[01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:24.810]  on other um videos if people want to add microbes there's companies that sell like microbes in a
[01:52:24.810 --> 01:52:30.410]  bottle and you know you'll know as well as i do that if you try and contain a microbe in a bottle
[01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:38.650]  that isn't in a soil or a natural environment that they will be there will be no microbes in
[01:52:38.650 --> 01:52:43.370]  there or at the best they'll be dead within you know 24 hours of the bottle being opened if there
[01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:48.490]  was any alive in there in the first place so it's just another market employee if people want to add
[01:52:48.490 --> 01:52:54.570]  some form of microbes to their soil so they've got their plants up and running um everything's
[01:52:54.570 --> 01:53:00.490]  growing nicely and they want to add some sort of microbial life into the soil they're not for
[01:53:00.490 --> 01:53:04.970]  people to go around digging up woodland areas or whatever but i have you know gone through the
[01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:10.970]  woods with a shovel and a bag and just taken a bag of soil underneath you know a rotted um
[01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:18.410]  a fallen tree you know lifted it up and it's been wet and stony and uh you can just tell that
[01:53:18.410 --> 01:53:24.970]  there's some really good good soil with lots of microbial life and beneficial bacterias existing
[01:53:24.970 --> 01:53:30.810]  in the soil i've just taken a bag of it and brought it back to the grow and um top dress
[01:53:30.810 --> 01:53:36.570]  some into the soil and ward it in and i you know it's free and there's definitely going to be
[01:53:36.570 --> 01:53:42.170]  trillions and trillions of microbes within it so you're most definitely going to be putting some
[01:53:42.170 --> 01:53:47.930]  into the soil but i've got a real problem with like companies selling products with absolutely
[01:53:47.930 --> 01:53:58.170]  zero scientific data that can even um uh prove that there's any microbes existing within dry
[01:53:58.170 --> 01:54:02.250]  form inside that bottle that's been sitting on the shelf or in the distribution center for the
[01:54:02.250 --> 01:54:07.130]  last six or seven months comes in comes in a dry form that you're supposed to add to a water
[01:54:07.130 --> 01:54:15.450]  solution to rehydrate and then water it into the soil um that's something that you know annoys me a
[01:54:15.450 --> 01:54:19.290]  little bit because it's just another clever marketing tactic and it's complete and utter
[01:54:19.290 --> 01:54:27.050]  bullshit bs and you know companies are selling these products to people and they you know believe
[01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:30.810]  that they're actually putting this stuff into the soil if you truly want to you know put some
[01:54:30.810 --> 01:54:35.530]  microbes into soil then do what i stated beforehand and if you don't go into a woods
[01:54:36.730 --> 01:54:43.050]  then even in your garden if you can make a place um you know either your compost bin or you can
[01:54:43.850 --> 01:54:51.290]  make an area that's got lots of decomposing and rotting vegetation and um uh tree bark or
[01:54:51.290 --> 01:54:54.810]  something like that and it's been left there for a while and you can even you know cover it with a
[01:54:54.810 --> 01:55:01.050]  bit of tarpaulin or something to um aid the breakdown of everything then take a few handfuls
[01:55:01.050 --> 01:55:05.290]  from a pile that you can create yourself and you're getting something meaningful and true
[01:55:05.290 --> 01:55:13.290]  to put into your soil um like the products um anger me a little bit because it's just it's not
[01:55:13.290 --> 01:55:18.250]  right you know and it's not true hey we're on your side with that man yeah we definitely all free
[01:55:18.890 --> 01:55:20.890]  yeah we do not promote bugs in the truck
[01:55:24.090 --> 01:55:29.690]  your own compost because you're getting everything you want there we've devoted
[01:55:29.690 --> 01:55:36.250]  several shows now late into uh teaching individuals how to make imos indigenous microorganisms which
[01:55:36.250 --> 01:55:40.490]  is kind of a kind of what you talked about i mean obviously it's a little bit different
[01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:45.290]  but i mean the concept is there like you're going out and getting that diversity the one thing i
[01:55:45.290 --> 01:55:50.970]  didn't i want to understand a little more on your thinking sir uh when you're saying that the like
[01:55:50.970 --> 01:55:56.170]  the peak progression is achieved quickly is that is that what you're saying like when you when you
[01:55:56.730 --> 01:56:02.730]  put your imos into that soil system that the diversity is achieved rather quickly
[01:56:05.770 --> 01:56:14.410]  yeah through like the the um so i just had to switch the line through the the data that i've
[01:56:14.410 --> 01:56:20.570]  looked at over the over the years the amount of time it actually takes for a high level of
[01:56:21.450 --> 01:56:29.290]  um diverse microbial life to become present in such a way that it can act on
[01:56:30.250 --> 01:56:36.810]  plants that are situated in it it isn't um that much of a length of time like
[01:56:38.890 --> 01:56:42.570]  especially if you're already using a composting seller or something that already contains that
[01:56:42.570 --> 01:56:47.530]  but in the breakdown can you define that real quick are you saying like years months what
[01:56:49.210 --> 01:56:57.210]  um from what i've seen um if you if you build a soil that contains all of these things you know
[01:56:58.810 --> 01:57:04.410]  your your compost and your dry amendments just you know for argument's sake the basics that people
[01:57:04.410 --> 01:57:12.730]  would use and you've kept it in a warm place covered um a decent nice warm temperature
[01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:21.930]  the level of microbial life that will arise from that is will usually be a
[01:57:22.810 --> 01:57:34.190]  significantly high amount within a four to five week period um okay so when you're saying you have
[01:57:34.190 --> 01:57:40.110]  data from that is there is there someone that you know is a pioneer with that research somewhere
[01:57:40.110 --> 01:57:44.830]  we can go and see that because yeah i've got some i've got some links i've always copy and paste the
[01:57:44.830 --> 01:57:51.310]  links of the the um the research and it's been from like independent scientific sources that's
[01:57:51.310 --> 01:57:59.310]  been conducted in controlled um environments um under the microscope and then they've been checking
[01:57:59.870 --> 01:58:06.590]  uh week one week two week three week four week five and with the actual um organic compounds
[01:58:06.590 --> 01:58:11.470]  in their raw form and the level of time for it to be broken down what temperature
[01:58:12.030 --> 01:58:18.910]  um was maintained the moisture content of the medium um etc etc so all of the
[01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:24.990]  principles were outlined and then it showed you you know week one two three four and five and
[01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:35.710]  after week five through many different um experiments um at five weeks of extremely high
[01:58:35.710 --> 01:58:41.550]  diverse level of microbial activity was achieved achieved around the five week part uh five week
[01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:46.430]  period so you know leave it longer five weeks six weeks seven weeks but like i said again you're
[01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:53.950]  going to reach a point where the optimal amount of microbial life has been achieved and um you know
[01:58:53.950 --> 01:58:58.990]  you can't just keep adding microbial life there comes a point where it's reached its maximum point
[01:58:58.990 --> 01:59:03.390]  where you know if it if it could reach exponentially there'd be nothing left apart
[01:59:03.390 --> 01:59:08.270]  from microbial life it would just be 100 microbe so it reaches a saturation point
[01:59:08.270 --> 01:59:14.910]  if you want to call it that and the saturation point gets the optimal saturation point through
[01:59:14.910 --> 01:59:18.830]  the studies that i've looked at within about five weeks in that controlled environment
[01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:25.150]  providing you know you haven't kept them in a in a cold place and the water the moisture
[01:59:25.150 --> 01:59:30.430]  content within the soil has been kept at the specifics that were used on the experiment
[01:59:31.230 --> 01:59:38.430]  with the different organic um substances the level of microbial activity rose
[01:59:39.070 --> 01:59:45.470]  um within a five week period to an extremely high level which would be considered like the
[01:59:45.470 --> 01:59:54.650]  the upper threshold of what would be the the saturation point i mean i i guess we gotta break
[01:59:54.650 --> 01:59:59.690]  that down anymore so i i agree with some of what you're saying but then at the same time i do believe
[01:59:59.690 --> 02:00:05.530]  you can achieve you know unbelievable growth if especially if you're building things like you had
[02:00:05.530 --> 02:00:10.970]  mentioned you got stuff going uh pre-emptive we always call that making chess moves with your grow
[02:00:11.450 --> 02:00:17.770]  uh but the the full potential the full diversity uh of of what you're trying to achieve
[02:00:18.730 --> 02:00:23.450]  and this could be my you know i'm always open to learning is has always been that it's going to
[02:00:23.450 --> 02:00:29.450]  take a probably a long time i even have friends in the commercial aspect growing cannabis with
[02:00:29.450 --> 02:00:34.410]  their living soil uh that are backing that up with their own sending their own testing saying
[02:00:34.410 --> 02:00:39.530]  that it's extremely hard uh to keep up with building diversity because things are churning
[02:00:39.690 --> 02:00:47.930]  so much i think uh if i can break in for a second i think um dr organics you're basically growing in
[02:00:47.930 --> 02:00:54.970]  pots um and what brian is talking about is more in soil beds yeah a much larger system very true
[02:00:54.970 --> 02:01:00.730]  i think we we need to focus on on the pot sides that you're growing in yeah one of the reasons
[02:01:00.730 --> 02:01:05.210]  you're doing it the way you're doing it well that's another reason something else that i will
[02:01:05.210 --> 02:01:14.810]  say about growing in beds and growing in pots okay now in this in this 1.5 by 1.5 meter tent
[02:01:14.810 --> 02:01:20.810]  it's a five by five i've got 930 liter pots so we've got three six nine um what's the mass on
[02:01:20.810 --> 02:01:27.770]  that because my mass is terrible nine times 30 is 270 is it 270 liters so there's 270 liters of soil
[02:01:28.330 --> 02:01:37.130]  within this tent and by using 200 liters of soil i've got nine plants and the canopy has been full
[02:01:37.130 --> 02:01:42.570]  to a degree where it'd be extremely difficult for me to sort of add any more tops and if i did have
[02:01:42.570 --> 02:01:47.850]  any more tops it would become from the existing the existing plants and it would only diminish
[02:01:47.850 --> 02:01:54.730]  the size of the buds on the others because it's very difficult to achieve you know every single
[02:01:54.730 --> 02:02:00.490]  top as consistent as one another because the plant is only capable through its genetics of
[02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:08.730]  of achieving a particular yield so you can either have a lower number of arms with bigger buds or
[02:02:08.730 --> 02:02:14.170]  you can have many more arms with more bud sites but the buds won't be as big as if you just had
[02:02:14.170 --> 02:02:21.690]  four or five it's common knowledge that everybody knows that so there's 270 liters of soil here and
[02:02:21.690 --> 02:02:27.130]  i've pulled and i've um filled this this tent and on some of my previous videos i'll do the lemon
[02:02:27.130 --> 02:02:33.770]  meringue pie which is like an extremely high yielding elite genetic freak of nature in terms
[02:02:33.770 --> 02:02:43.530]  of yield and if i do the same layout um the yield that i can yield from this is about 1900 grams
[02:02:43.530 --> 02:02:49.290]  um so it's like four pounds in a in a five by five and i was pulling about 2000 true watts from the
[02:02:50.170 --> 02:02:56.730]  led lighting so there's enough light in there and i had a scrogna up and you know the the buds were
[02:02:56.730 --> 02:03:00.330]  you know as long as your arm if you look back on some of my posts you can see it and you can see
[02:03:00.330 --> 02:03:06.410]  the the live dry weights that i do on there now if i was to use double the volume of soil
[02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:12.010]  it would not add double the the amount of yield it wouldn't add any more yield because the yield
[02:03:12.810 --> 02:03:21.450]  is down to genetic expression of the plant light par ppfd coverage uniformity across the available
[02:03:21.450 --> 02:03:29.770]  canopy and the environment if all of those factors are achieved and then ample nutrition
[02:03:30.730 --> 02:03:37.450]  is also achieved um either through an organic living soil or if you're using synthetic fertilizers
[02:03:38.410 --> 02:03:45.850]  you reach a point again the point of saturation the highest level of yield comparable to the amount
[02:03:45.850 --> 02:03:51.370]  of light that is in the tent and it reaches a point where you can put the you could put the
[02:03:51.370 --> 02:03:58.570]  entirety of the sun in this tent the the plants as you know they can only see you know without
[02:03:58.570 --> 02:04:04.890]  added supplementary co2 in a sealed room 900 to 1100 ppfd so once that uniformity of light
[02:04:04.890 --> 02:04:10.970]  is reached among the canopy no more further light will achieve greater levels of photosynthesis and
[02:04:10.970 --> 02:04:15.930]  end and yield so there's a there's a point that you reach where the maximum amount of
[02:04:15.930 --> 02:04:22.410]  yield that can be achieved can be achieved and that can be achieved with this level of soil
[02:04:23.210 --> 02:04:29.850]  and with the beds this is the thing with the beds the beds take a lot longer to dry out
[02:04:30.490 --> 02:04:36.650]  so this whole like wet and dry cycle that i like to use within the pots is much easier to achieve
[02:04:36.650 --> 02:04:41.130]  because you've got singular pots with the with the one root system from the one plant in there
[02:04:42.410 --> 02:04:51.930]  um they dry out um much quicker than if you're using a bed a bed in my belief is an unnecessary
[02:04:52.570 --> 02:05:01.930]  to achieve um your maximum amount of yield so you know 270 liters if i was to use 500 liters of soil
[02:05:02.890 --> 02:05:08.170]  in the exact same environment using the exact same genetics covering the exact same level
[02:05:08.170 --> 02:05:13.290]  of canopy cover with the exact same ppfd exact same strain exact same everything
[02:05:14.330 --> 02:05:19.210]  500 liters this these grown in big in 50 liter pots instead of 30 liter pots
[02:05:19.770 --> 02:05:27.850]  there's going to be absolutely zero increase in my yield so there is very little benefit into using
[02:05:27.850 --> 02:05:32.970]  excessive amounts of soil and i'll say excessive because it's an unnecessary amount of soil that
[02:05:32.970 --> 02:05:38.090]  people have been that people are being asked to use think that they need to use such a large amount
[02:05:38.090 --> 02:05:48.890]  of soil um to to achieve great results and company other companies that are makers or you
[02:05:48.890 --> 02:05:55.770]  know distributors of living soils are pushing this for one reason and one reason only and is that the
[02:05:55.770 --> 02:06:01.610]  more soil they sell the more money that they make and you know for all the time that i've been doing
[02:06:02.090 --> 02:06:08.250]  if it was more beneficial for me and i was getting a larger crop and a better quality crop
[02:06:08.250 --> 02:06:12.250]  from using pots that were double triple the size or putting the bed in here that was
[02:06:12.890 --> 02:06:17.610]  that could hold six or seven hundred liters of soil not only is it very difficult for me to
[02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:23.370]  reach 1.5 meters across because i wouldn't be able to physically get in the bed to do any
[02:06:23.370 --> 02:06:27.930]  manipulation low stress training lollipopping etc i'd only be able to walk around the perimeter of
[02:06:27.930 --> 02:06:35.210]  the tent if i had one single bed in here which seems to be um the norm with a lot of living soil
[02:06:35.210 --> 02:06:40.410]  to be using these huge beds when you're using pots you can simply take the pot out and then
[02:06:40.410 --> 02:06:44.890]  you can actually get in and you can attend to all the plants and you can you know lollipop the plants
[02:06:44.890 --> 02:06:49.530]  low stress the stress train the plants and do all the things you need to do it's very very difficult
[02:06:50.570 --> 02:06:57.370]  to add that level of care if you had a bed and they are selling beds that are meant for a 1.5
[02:06:57.370 --> 02:07:04.890]  by 1.55 by 510 which contains nearly two and a half times the amount of soil now
[02:07:05.770 --> 02:07:11.690]  like i can only see a company wanting to sell nearly two and a half times the amount of soil
[02:07:11.690 --> 02:07:15.690]  that is actually needed for one reason one reason alone is because the more soil you sell
[02:07:16.250 --> 02:07:23.290]  the more dry memory you sell to then reamend the soil afterwards um and for me it's just unnecessary
[02:07:23.290 --> 02:07:29.850]  like you should only use what is needed to achieve what can be achieved and you know where
[02:07:29.850 --> 02:07:34.810]  does it where does it stop and the scientific data amongst it as well like the majority of
[02:07:34.810 --> 02:07:41.610]  it's only going to be anecdotal that people say oh yeah but i use a really big bed i use a really
[02:07:41.610 --> 02:07:47.050]  big bed in there well you do a video of your really big bed with 600 liters of soil in a
[02:07:47.050 --> 02:07:52.810]  five by five and use one of these lights and we both do the same strain if we could yeah so
[02:07:53.770 --> 02:07:58.010]  even as much as we can in the same environment and then we'll see what the difference
[02:07:58.010 --> 02:08:07.610]  in overall crop production is because the crop production is down to all of the other factors
[02:08:08.490 --> 02:08:18.810]  that i um stipulated beforehand the ppfd um your environment your genetics how you filled your how
[02:08:18.810 --> 02:08:25.930]  you filled your tent you've utilized the canopy space correctly etc and then having ample nutrition
[02:08:25.930 --> 02:08:31.850]  to support the plant at its optimal growth rate from beginning to end and the 30 liter pot even
[02:08:31.850 --> 02:08:39.850]  if it has to be top dressed and um had some more food added to it if it become depleted uh um
[02:08:39.850 --> 02:08:46.650]  earlier than you wanted i just can't see the point in using these massive great big beds like
[02:08:46.650 --> 02:08:52.490]  we're just deviating away again from like the cannabis plant what the cannabis plant is um
[02:08:53.450 --> 02:09:05.210]  genetically designed to grow and thrive um and we're sort of thinking that bigger is always
[02:09:05.210 --> 02:09:08.890]  better if i get a really big bed in there and i put loads and loads of soil in there and i put
[02:09:08.890 --> 02:09:13.690]  loads and loads of microbial activity and i've got loads and loads of stuff in there then that's
[02:09:13.690 --> 02:09:19.690]  really going to give me the yield but the the short answer to it is that that's not what dictates
[02:09:19.690 --> 02:09:24.650]  crop production yield like if that was the case then every single organic um
[02:09:26.410 --> 02:09:32.250]  medicinal cannabis cultivation premises across all the states of america that that grow that
[02:09:32.250 --> 02:09:35.850]  way would all be using these massive beds but they don't those that grow organic don't grow
[02:09:35.850 --> 02:09:40.970]  that way because it's a massive amount of work it's a massive amount of waste because it's
[02:09:40.970 --> 02:09:49.610]  you know you're trying to replicate this huge soil bed that would be more present in nature
[02:09:49.610 --> 02:09:55.930]  because we've got you know an x an exponential depth and width of soil if we go into a garden
[02:09:55.930 --> 02:10:02.650]  or allotment or something like that but you know for for the purpose of cannabis cultivation and
[02:10:02.650 --> 02:10:08.890]  you know growing a plant from beginning to end using the minimal amount of soil and food
[02:10:08.890 --> 02:10:14.730]  necessary to achieve the optimal maximum amount of growth and yield is what it should be about
[02:10:14.730 --> 02:10:25.450]  and i just feel that the reasons behind you know these big these big beds are due to living soil
[02:10:25.450 --> 02:10:31.770]  companies and i know there's a few in the united states or whatever using a clever marketing tactic
[02:10:31.770 --> 02:10:36.650]  that oh if we get if we've got a thousand we've got a million customers and now we perpetuate
[02:10:36.650 --> 02:10:40.650]  the idea that using these big soil beds is going to achieve much greater and it's going to have
[02:10:40.650 --> 02:10:46.970]  much more benefits than using a smaller amount of soil then we're going to be selling double the
[02:10:46.970 --> 02:10:51.050]  amount of soil and double the amount of dry amendment to then reamend the soil afterwards
[02:10:51.050 --> 02:10:56.250]  and compost accelerators and whatever else it may be and that is the truth behind it because
[02:10:57.530 --> 02:11:01.130]  as i said i'm not new to this and i haven't just been doing this recently i've been doing this for
[02:11:01.210 --> 02:11:04.250]  the best part of my life and i have tried bigger pots and bigger beds and
[02:11:08.090 --> 02:11:15.290]  in relation to the crop productivity if you've got a light that is capable of producing x amount
[02:11:15.290 --> 02:11:21.850]  of power and ppfd and you've got a strain that is capable of producing x amount of grams per
[02:11:21.850 --> 02:11:28.570]  meter square when nutrition is optimized and you're optimizing your environment
[02:11:29.530 --> 02:11:38.330]  then adding this huge soil bed it just offers absolutely no benefit at all in my eyes and
[02:11:38.330 --> 02:11:43.450]  that maybe i'm wrong and maybe other people have got a different take on that but i just like
[02:11:43.450 --> 02:11:48.170]  people to try and approach things logically and sometimes if it goes against what they believe
[02:11:48.170 --> 02:11:52.410]  is right or what they've done in the past and even if somebody says something that
[02:11:52.410 --> 02:11:58.170]  goes against my ideas because i try and look at things very very carefully and very very precisely
[02:11:58.250 --> 02:12:04.570]  before i make a decision or make a statement and i try both ways on numerous times i don't just do
[02:12:04.570 --> 02:12:11.530]  it once i do it twice and you know i can have my own experience and use the same strains in
[02:12:12.330 --> 02:12:17.690]  using larger volumes of soil and see if the overall quality is better and the yield is better
[02:12:17.690 --> 02:12:22.010]  and each and every single time i've done it as long as the other factors have been optimized as
[02:12:22.010 --> 02:12:29.130]  i've said before then the level of soil present as long as you use a fairly decent size pot around
[02:12:29.130 --> 02:12:35.130]  30 liters 270 300 liters per 1.5 meter square anything that goes above that is just a waste of
[02:12:35.130 --> 02:12:40.090]  soil and it's just adding to the destruction of the planet because the whole process of the labor
[02:12:40.090 --> 02:12:47.050]  and the co2 and the carbon emissions and everything that it takes to create the soil and feed the soil
[02:12:47.130 --> 02:12:53.290]  the amendments and the distribution of the amendments and you know you're buying x amount
[02:12:53.290 --> 02:12:59.610]  of kilos that has to be the sent in a ups van instead of one kilo it's five kilos because
[02:12:59.610 --> 02:13:03.770]  you're using five times the amount of soil all of these things and everybody's doing that you're all
[02:13:03.770 --> 02:13:11.130]  contributing all of us are all contributing to a higher level of um of waste like my philosophy is
[02:13:11.130 --> 02:13:20.090]  to use the minimal effective dosage and not try and use excessive amounts thinking that bigger is
[02:13:20.090 --> 02:13:24.330]  always better we're just of this mindset all the time that if i'd use bigger if i use really big
[02:13:24.330 --> 02:13:28.730]  bed like it's going to be bigger so that was my thought so i don't know what your thoughts are on
[02:13:28.730 --> 02:13:38.490]  that well i hear you i mean there is a point of you can't get any more diminishing returns whatever
[02:13:38.490 --> 02:13:43.690]  you want to call it a bell curve so it makes sense and especially in an environment where
[02:13:43.690 --> 02:13:48.810]  you're in a tent you're trapped you don't have 12 foot high ceilings yeah but if you did have
[02:13:48.810 --> 02:13:55.210]  12 foot high ceilings and you did have the capacity to raise the lights then a deeper
[02:13:55.210 --> 02:14:01.690]  wider pot would eventually yield more but again it's it's it's limitations that that you're talking
[02:14:02.490 --> 02:14:09.610]  that this is only applicable for um indoor cultivation okay so in the states or countries
[02:14:09.610 --> 02:14:14.090]  with a higher climate and outdoor cultivation if you were to till and prepare a vast
[02:14:15.130 --> 02:14:21.210]  amount of soil and you was growing in an open space and you had you know the elements and the
[02:14:21.210 --> 02:14:26.250]  sun and the rain and everything to contend with and you weren't limited by a particular amount
[02:14:26.250 --> 02:14:33.050]  of space then i totally agree that um planting directly into the ground and preparing the ground
[02:14:33.050 --> 02:14:37.690]  with or preparing directly in the ground or preparing a certain circumference of ground
[02:14:37.690 --> 02:14:44.650]  to plant each plant in or preparing the entirety of the ground and keeping that huge biodiverse
[02:14:45.530 --> 02:14:53.850]  living soil um would is a much more beneficial thing to do but when it comes to growing inside
[02:14:53.850 --> 02:14:59.130]  the majority of cultivation in the uk if not you know 95 percent of it or more because the
[02:14:59.130 --> 02:15:05.130]  weather isn't great like you guys have got out in sunny colorado it is all done inside and all of
[02:15:05.130 --> 02:15:12.170]  the organic living soils within the united kingdom are all perpetuating that you need to be using
[02:15:12.170 --> 02:15:17.850]  double the amount of soil that is necessary to achieve the yield so we're not like everybody
[02:15:17.850 --> 02:15:23.370]  else we're trying to say to people look you don't need to you be using all this soil like you can
[02:15:23.450 --> 02:15:30.570]  just use you can use two you can use 270 liters of soil so we sell 55 liter bags for instance yeah
[02:15:30.570 --> 02:15:37.530]  and so i'll just put things in comparison so it's 51 52 50 that's five bags of soil 40 40 pound a
[02:15:37.530 --> 02:15:43.850]  bag for 8126 it's 200 pound so you can do a grow from beginning to end with around
[02:15:45.690 --> 02:15:51.610]  three to five weeks of vegetation from seed or three two to four weeks if you're doing it from
[02:15:51.610 --> 02:15:59.530]  established clone and eight weeks to 10 weeks of um flowering in a 30 liter pot and all you have to
[02:15:59.530 --> 02:16:07.450]  do is add tap water for 200 quid now if you was to use any other form of um nutrients well for a
[02:16:07.450 --> 02:16:14.650]  start you'd have the same amount of soil if not more at 15 pounds a bag so you're almost um spent
[02:16:14.650 --> 02:16:19.850]  60 you spent 60 percent of the total 200 pound budget that you would on dr organics plus you've
[02:16:19.850 --> 02:16:25.210]  got to buy another 250 pounds worth of nutrients and go through the backbreaking task of doing it
[02:16:25.210 --> 02:16:30.570]  now there's like what companies do is they try and achieve a minimum spend
[02:16:31.770 --> 02:16:36.090]  um per customer per grow for it to be commercially viable for them so
[02:16:37.130 --> 02:16:44.250]  companies will bring out x amount of range of nutrients and on average using their specific
[02:16:44.250 --> 02:16:54.170]  dilution rate and um soil ratio you're going to be spending about 250 300 pounds per grow in a
[02:16:54.170 --> 02:16:59.210]  five by five and then you're going to throw that soil away and you're going to do it again
[02:16:59.210 --> 02:17:05.210]  but with the doctor organics you spend 200 pounds the first time on the soil the second time you're
[02:17:05.210 --> 02:17:09.690]  just going to use the dry amendment for instance to reinvigorate your soil you're going to add some
[02:17:09.770 --> 02:17:15.210]  of your worm castings your own home compost etc you know bioactivators etc using your compost bin
[02:17:15.210 --> 02:17:21.930]  outside and let mother nature do its work so the second time the the amendment is one liter of
[02:17:21.930 --> 02:17:28.890]  of the amendment per 50 liters so that's five call it six liters of dry amendment at 15 pound a liter
[02:17:28.890 --> 02:17:36.570]  so it's 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 75 pounds so you buy 200 pounds the first time then every grow after
[02:17:36.650 --> 02:17:40.890]  it costs you 75 pounds it's absolute peanuts and you don't have to throw the soil away and buy it
[02:17:40.890 --> 02:17:44.330]  and bring it in put it in your car carry out the stairs empty all out blah blah blah blah blah
[02:17:45.370 --> 02:17:53.610]  so that's 75 pounds per per three month turnaround the average grow is is 12 weeks people usually do
[02:17:53.610 --> 02:17:57.450]  three or four weeks veg and eight weeks flour so it's every every 12 weeks there's a turnaround
[02:17:58.010 --> 02:18:04.890]  the companies can't make money if their customers only spend 75 pounds per grow after the first
[02:18:04.890 --> 02:18:10.090]  initial 200 pounds not only can the companies not make money but the hydroponic shops that sell all
[02:18:10.090 --> 02:18:16.090]  of these nutrients imagine that they were just selling the uh dr organics dry amendment or guy
[02:18:16.090 --> 02:18:20.970]  green or whoever else's live builder soil you know they've got something similar for instance yeah
[02:18:22.250 --> 02:18:27.610]  and you've got your customer that comes into your hydroponic shop and i've run one for 16 years yeah
[02:18:28.170 --> 02:18:35.130]  you know been and seen uh most things in the hydroponics industry and your customer comes in
[02:18:35.130 --> 02:18:39.930]  every three months and says oh hi there mate yeah can i get um 75 quids for that dry amendment
[02:18:39.930 --> 02:18:44.330]  please yeah here you go mate from that 75 quid we brought in from the wholesaler
[02:18:45.690 --> 02:18:51.370]  and um we've had to pay 30 quid for it and then we've got to pay vat and then we've got to pay
[02:18:51.370 --> 02:18:56.330]  the overheads and the shop and the rent and the and the cost and the utilities and and everything
[02:18:56.650 --> 02:19:02.090]  so the profit that we make off that 75 quids but 25 30 quid after vat so if that customer comes and
[02:19:02.090 --> 02:19:08.410]  sees us four times a year we make three six nine we make 120 pounds per customer where if we send
[02:19:08.410 --> 02:19:14.090]  if we sell them nutrients and they're spending 300 pounds they're spending 1200 pounds which is 10
[02:19:14.090 --> 02:19:20.250]  times the amount which means that our profit would be 10 times what it is selling dry amendments so
[02:19:21.210 --> 02:19:24.650]  the nutrient companies are very very very very worried
[02:19:27.050 --> 02:19:33.210]  about the whole organic living soil movement and i'm just trying to outline into layman's
[02:19:33.210 --> 02:19:41.210]  terms so people can understand like the business model behind it that organic living soil and dry
[02:19:41.210 --> 02:19:49.370]  amendments and renewable um eco-friendly etc the lines of what everybody should be going down to
[02:19:49.370 --> 02:19:56.010]  save the planet and save uh save money and everything else is going to put so many people
[02:19:56.010 --> 02:20:00.650]  out of business it beggars belief especially in the united kingdom where the business has
[02:20:00.650 --> 02:20:08.890]  been set up like and the same is is for europe as well um america is a is such a large scale
[02:20:08.890 --> 02:20:14.570]  and there's so many facilities that run hydroponic systems there's always going to be a demand for
[02:20:14.570 --> 02:20:18.250]  nutrients so it doesn't really affect them so much but for the majority of people in the united
[02:20:18.250 --> 02:20:22.410]  kingdom that are just hobbyists and want to grow a bit of weed for themselves for whatever reason
[02:20:23.210 --> 02:20:30.090]  it's gonna you know really um destroy the bottom line of the nutrient company so it's the enemy of
[02:20:30.090 --> 02:20:34.250]  the nutrient companies and this is why they've been telling fables that oh yeah but you don't
[02:20:34.250 --> 02:20:40.890]  get a very good yield and you know the yield's not very good if you use a living soil you have to
[02:20:40.890 --> 02:20:45.850]  you know use 10 times the amount of stuff and you have to use all these things because it's the
[02:20:45.850 --> 02:20:49.930]  it's their enemy they know full well especially like people like me that are doing podcasts and
[02:20:49.930 --> 02:20:53.210]  instagram with thousands of people watching me on a daily basis going
[02:20:53.210 --> 02:20:56.810]  fucking hell this dude man he's using nothing but fucking british tap water and he's fucking
[02:20:56.810 --> 02:21:01.210]  pulling these years i look at his fucking plants like well he's using his water and then he got
[02:21:01.210 --> 02:21:04.650]  all these other people using the products as well all saying the same thing like fuck me look at my
[02:21:04.650 --> 02:21:10.090]  plant man like doing side by sides with canner and dutch pro and all the other nutrient companies out
[02:21:10.090 --> 02:21:14.970]  there you know i haven't asked them to do it they've just done it because they wanted to see
[02:21:14.970 --> 02:21:20.570]  the difference for themselves you know what is the true comparison and representation and they're
[02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:29.210]  just absolutely blown away because it's actually produces a far better rate of growth and overall
[02:21:29.210 --> 02:21:33.690]  product than all of the nutrients that they've been using so these nutrient companies really
[02:21:33.690 --> 02:21:39.050]  are not going to be happy with the whole living soil movement like and as time goes on months and
[02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:43.610]  years down the line and more and more people become educated and more and more people use it
[02:21:44.570 --> 02:21:49.930]  you know within the united kingdom the hydroponic shops are on the way out and we hardly turn over
[02:21:49.930 --> 02:21:55.930]  any money and make anything as it is at the moment um in the united kingdom the vast majority of
[02:21:55.930 --> 02:22:02.250]  commercial growers that sell you know in the uk what happens is you'll have lots of people
[02:22:02.250 --> 02:22:09.370]  you know growing in warehouses before it was mainly uk guys that done it um on on hydro systems and
[02:22:09.370 --> 02:22:14.570]  now it's the albanians so the albanians have come to the uk and they've sort of taken over the um
[02:22:16.330 --> 02:22:24.570]  the cannabis trade cannabis in 2012 13 14 it used to be 7 000 pounds uk pounds so i don't know what
[02:22:24.570 --> 02:22:31.130]  that's eight thousand dollars or whatever a kilo so 2.2 pounds to a kilo that was the price so it
[02:22:31.130 --> 02:22:35.370]  was very beneficial for people to grow cannabis because they could make a lot of money out of it
[02:22:35.370 --> 02:22:39.690]  the albanians come in and they drove the price down and the price of a kilo now is around 3 000
[02:22:39.690 --> 02:22:44.490]  pounds so less less than half the price of what it used to be so when you factor in all the other
[02:22:44.490 --> 02:22:51.450]  costs into it there's um there's no money to be made now all of these guys are always going to
[02:22:51.450 --> 02:22:55.450]  use nutrients because they don't really know anything else and they're doing it on large
[02:22:56.570 --> 02:23:01.290]  a lot of it hydroponically so they're always going to be using the nutrients but the vast
[02:23:01.290 --> 02:23:07.770]  majority of customers in the uk that come to the hydroponic shops are hobbyists um and they've got
[02:23:07.770 --> 02:23:16.890]  you know a 1.2 by 2.4 or or 1.2 by 1.2 or a 5 by 5 um like this 10 and they all before they were all
[02:23:16.890 --> 02:23:22.570]  spending you know 1200 pounds on average per year they were using high pressure sodium so they'd have
[02:23:22.570 --> 02:23:27.450]  to replace the ballast and they'd have to replace the bulb on every grow so that was four bulbs that
[02:23:27.450 --> 02:23:31.930]  they'd sell and a couple of ballasts but now you've got an led light that's got a five-year
[02:23:31.930 --> 02:23:36.250]  warranty on it so they buy an led light they don't come back to the shop for five years like why would
[02:23:36.250 --> 02:23:42.410]  you the optimal amount of ppfd has been reached i've got 900 and 1500 in the center and 900 on
[02:23:42.410 --> 02:23:47.130]  the corner you could you know in 10 years time you could bring a light out i've already achieved
[02:23:47.130 --> 02:23:53.690]  the optimal amount of ppfd needed to achieve the maximum yield so that light's going to last me for
[02:23:53.690 --> 02:24:01.450]  five years and once more people start using organic living soil the nutrient companies
[02:24:02.810 --> 02:24:07.050]  haven't got anyone to sell it to because nobody wants to buy it and they've already started
[02:24:07.050 --> 02:24:13.130]  actually selling it directly to the public online at wholesale prices so if you go onto amazon or
[02:24:13.130 --> 02:24:18.650]  you go onto ebay all of these um nutrient companies can and dutch pro you might be
[02:24:18.650 --> 02:24:23.850]  familiar with some of those they're all selling directly online well they're not supposed to do
[02:24:23.850 --> 02:24:28.250]  that because the hydroponics industry which i've been a part of with a shot for many many years
[02:24:28.970 --> 02:24:37.690]  has pushed their products and push their agenda and push their feed charts to people unwittingly
[02:24:39.130 --> 02:24:43.770]  most people have done because it's just been you know paying the bills with whatever nutrient we
[02:24:43.770 --> 02:24:47.690]  can make the most money off is the new best nutrients in sliced bread when they're all
[02:24:47.690 --> 02:25:04.770]  the
[02:25:04.770 --> 02:25:19.330]  that
[02:25:19.330 --> 02:25:48.550]  then
[02:25:48.550 --> 02:26:07.470]  the
[02:26:07.470 --> 02:26:33.230]  and
[02:26:33.530 --> 02:26:36.270]  will fill the treasury beyond belief.
[02:26:36.270 --> 02:26:37.510]  Like forget about the money
[02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:39.170]  that they make from cigarettes and alcohol,
[02:26:39.170 --> 02:26:43.170]  the money that they make from weed will be astronomical
[02:26:43.170 --> 02:26:44.790]  and I'm sure you're aware that that's the case
[02:26:44.790 --> 02:26:45.950]  in a lot of states in America.
[02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:47.730]  That was one of the main driving forces
[02:26:47.730 --> 02:26:49.470]  behind the legalization.
[02:26:49.470 --> 02:26:51.470]  On the federal level is still illegal
[02:26:52.470 --> 02:26:55.230]  but on the state level, it's legal
[02:26:55.230 --> 02:26:58.710]  and the taxes that they make from it are huge.
[02:26:58.710 --> 02:27:00.430]  So that's just a little bit of an insight really
[02:27:00.430 --> 02:27:27.030]  the
[02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:29.750]  companies in the UK that actually do that.
[02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:34.750]  There's myself and two or three others, you know?
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:41.960]  Yeah, that was a wonderful insight into the industry.
[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:46.960]  And, you know, what do you think the percentage
[02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:50.080]  of people that are actually shifting
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:53.040]  to living soils is at this point?
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:56.780]  Well, it's rising exponentially, most definitely.
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:01.920]  There's been very few people on Instagram like myself
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:04.440]  that's been a real advocate of living soil.
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:08.000]  Somebody in the UK, other companies,
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:12.120]  they put, you know, they're selling their product
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:13.600]  towards the cannabis community.
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:15.240]  They're not selling it towards allotment.
[02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:16.400]  Allotment don't spend money.
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:18.120]  They're old guys that have been growing
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:20.040]  with blood, fish and bone for years.
[02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:24.140]  Like they don't need to buy tailored dry amendments
[02:28:24.140 --> 02:28:25.440]  and live in soils.
[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:27.240]  But, you know, saying that I've actually got quite
[02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:29.440]  a few customers that are champion allotment growers
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:32.400]  and they buy the living soil because it's the only way
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:34.640]  that they can win a rosette.
[02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:37.520]  We've got one guy who's just run one first place
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:39.280]  and he's gonna be taking a picture
[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:44.240]  of his winning vegetables and all the Dr. Organic's products
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:46.920]  with his rosette and we're gonna put it onto our website
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:48.060]  and on our social media.
[02:28:48.060 --> 02:28:51.320]  So that'll be one person that's grown
[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:53.560]  award-winning vegetables using the soil.
[02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:55.720]  Fucking hell, this exodus cheese absolutely stinks, man.
[02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:58.080]  I need to get my head out of here for a sec.
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:28:58.920]  I'll debrief.
[02:28:58.920 --> 02:28:59.760]  Yes.
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:04.560]  And, oh, I fucking totally lost track now.
[02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:05.640]  What was I saying?
[02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:07.920]  Yeah, so that's basically what we're coming up against
[02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:10.520]  but the more and more people that use it
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:14.840]  and see the results.
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:18.080]  If you ever see any of my live videos at all,
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:20.280]  I know the times difference is different,
[02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:23.080]  but I have like 30, 40, 50 people join the video
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:24.840]  and sometimes people will join in
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:25.920]  and they'll show their plants
[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:27.560]  or using Dr. Organic's Living Soil
[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:31.000]  and if people just can't believe the results
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  because they've just been conformed to the idea
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.680]  that they need to use nutrients and nutrients are superior.
[02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:38.400]  So when they see something that is so much better,
[02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:43.400]  like I'll do the zoom-ins and I'll always say to people,
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:45.960]  you can see like the,
[02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:50.320]  sorry, my thing's turned upside down.
[02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:55.280]  Yeah, the health and vitality of the plant
[02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:56.880]  and there's never any deficiencies.
[02:29:56.880 --> 02:29:58.280]  And these have been in here,
[02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:00.840]  I veged them for two weeks from clone.
[02:30:00.840 --> 02:30:02.400]  They were an established clone
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:05.280]  and they're three weeks and two days into flower.
[02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:06.720]  So it's been five weeks in total
[02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:08.920]  and it's had nothing but tap water from beginning to end.
[02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:11.640]  And people in the UK are just not used
[02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:12.680]  to seeing things like this
[02:30:12.680 --> 02:30:15.000]  because they've never seen anything like that before.
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:16.560]  They've only ever known,
[02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:19.680]  oh, it smells so nice.
[02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:24.000]  They've only ever known nutrients.
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.280]  Like very, very few people in the UK
[02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:28.160]  are even aware of Living Soil.
[02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:33.160]  So it's breaking in at the very early stages at the moment.
[02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:42.440]  But our sales have just risen exponentially every month,
[02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:43.720]  every month that goes on.
[02:30:43.720 --> 02:30:45.600]  You know, like most businesses,
[02:30:45.600 --> 02:30:47.520]  they're a bit flat really for the first couple of years
[02:30:47.520 --> 02:30:48.640]  until you actually see anything.
[02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:51.760]  But it's like one month we sell this much
[02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:53.440]  and the next month we're selling double the amount.
[02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:54.880]  And then the following month we're selling
[02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:56.800]  double the amount of what we sold the month before.
[02:30:56.800 --> 02:30:58.360]  And it's been going up and up and up like that.
[02:30:58.360 --> 02:31:00.400]  And just absolute rave reviews
[02:31:00.400 --> 02:31:03.320]  and people are just so overjoyed and so happy.
[02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:06.800]  And they just really evangelicalize
[02:31:06.800 --> 02:31:10.040]  the Living Soil movement without asking to
[02:31:10.040 --> 02:31:11.600]  because they're generally so happy
[02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:13.880]  with the results that they've got.
[02:31:13.880 --> 02:31:15.520]  And they're like, fuck these nutrients, man.
[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:17.160]  I've been spending all my money
[02:31:17.160 --> 02:31:18.200]  and I'm always getting deficiencies
[02:31:18.200 --> 02:31:20.520]  and I don't know to give it cow mag or this or that
[02:31:20.520 --> 02:31:22.440]  or too much or too little.
[02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:24.960]  And for I give this Living Soil a go
[02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:26.440]  and I brought a bag of your stuff, man.
[02:31:26.440 --> 02:31:28.360]  And I've never grown a plant like it in all my life.
[02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:29.640]  Like, and that's it.
[02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:32.040]  Anyone who uses it, they never go back to
[02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:35.960]  bottled nutrients in the United Kingdom.
[02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:38.520]  And that's the frightening thing for the nutrient company
[02:31:38.520 --> 02:31:40.840]  that it's gonna put them out of business.
[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:42.720]  Like in the next two years,
[02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:45.960]  they'll only be selling to people
[02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:47.360]  that are doing big commercial grows
[02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:49.200]  with synthetic fertilizers
[02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:51.280]  and that won't be enough to sustain them.
[02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:53.120]  The market in England is small.
[02:31:53.120 --> 02:31:55.800]  They've got Europe and the States and Canada
[02:31:55.800 --> 02:32:00.200]  and I'm sure that they do very well selling stuff there.
[02:32:00.200 --> 02:32:02.640]  But in the United Kingdom,
[02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:05.360]  remember this podcast, this conversation,
[02:32:05.360 --> 02:32:06.640]  two years from now,
[02:32:06.640 --> 02:32:09.960]  the nutrient companies are done and finished.
[02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:12.520]  There will be no such thing as people will be laughing.
[02:32:13.320 --> 02:32:14.160]  The way that people laugh in the States
[02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:15.640]  and go, oh, you guys in the UK, man,
[02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:17.720]  why are you not using Living Soil,
[02:32:17.720 --> 02:32:18.800]  using all these nutrients?
[02:32:18.800 --> 02:32:22.120]  Like you type of, you guys are more knowledgeable
[02:32:22.120 --> 02:32:27.120]  and collectively have a great deal of expertise amongst you.
[02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:30.840]  You know the truth.
[02:32:30.840 --> 02:32:32.440]  Very few people in the UK do,
[02:32:32.440 --> 02:32:37.440]  but more and more people are starting to see now.
[02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:40.200]  And it's just had a complete snowball effect, really.
[02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:43.760]  Yeah, we've had similar results out here.
[02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:46.120]  I mean, I think that anybody that pushes
[02:32:46.120 --> 02:32:49.240]  into a Living Soil definitely seals,
[02:32:49.240 --> 02:32:53.280]  sees a much higher quality in the end product
[02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:54.600]  than they do with the salts.
[02:32:54.600 --> 02:32:57.760]  And let's face it, it's a 10th of the price.
[02:32:57.760 --> 02:33:01.200]  So it's kind of like a no brainer,
[02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:02.720]  but if you don't know about it
[02:33:02.720 --> 02:33:05.000]  or you're scared to try it,
[02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.760]  then that's the biggest deterrent.
[02:33:07.760 --> 02:33:11.200]  But guys like you putting information out there
[02:33:11.200 --> 02:33:16.200]  and showing the process as well as how well it actually works
[02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:18.120]  and how affordable it is,
[02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:20.840]  is gonna definitely help the industry
[02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:23.720]  as a whole moving forward.
[02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:25.800]  And I live in Southern California.
[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:28.800]  And when I first really started looking around
[02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:32.840]  to understand how the people grew here,
[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:35.520]  I was blown away at how many companies
[02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:36.520]  are just pure salt.
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:38.200]  Yeah.
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:41.720]  As you go up North, North of San Francisco,
[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:43.520]  even South of San Francisco,
[02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:48.280]  it's all Living Soils and soil fertility and microbes.
[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:51.960]  So it's interesting that you can get such a cultural divide
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:54.800]  in such a short area.
[02:33:54.800 --> 02:33:58.080]  There was one quick thing I just wanted to say
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:01.320]  just because the guy in the top corner
[02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:03.440]  with a baseball cap on, Brian, is it Brian?
[02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:04.280]  Rubber ducky.
[02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:08.360]  He's saying about the genetics.
[02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:10.640]  And America's got some amazing genetics.
[02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:12.520]  And this is something I have to tell you as well,
[02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:13.600]  because you might not be aware of this.
[02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:17.080]  So before the whole, the Calipax,
[02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:18.400]  they call it in the United Kingdom,
[02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:20.400]  before the gelatos and the biscottis
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:22.440]  and all these different varieties of cannabis
[02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:24.720]  that were not available before,
[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:27.280]  this was probably three or four years ago.
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:28.920]  So it's been a relatively new thing
[02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:31.120]  within the United Kingdom.
[02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:33.120]  The average price of an ounce of weed
[02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:35.240]  is 200 UK pounds.
[02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:41.160]  When the American flavors, as they call it,
[02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:43.240]  first came to the United Kingdom,
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:46.920]  they were selling for 800 to 1,000 pounds per ounce,
[02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:47.880]  yeah, UK pounds.
[02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:52.080]  So a kilo was around $40,000 for one kilo.
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:54.080]  So you can imagine how much money
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:55.600]  people made in the United Kingdom
[02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:57.120]  in the first year or so
[02:34:57.120 --> 02:35:00.000]  when Californian strains first came,
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.200]  because it was something new that they'd never had before.
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:03.360]  And there's a lot of PGR,
[02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:08.360]  the dense buds that are grown in the dispensaries.
[02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:13.800]  And I'm not a fan of anything that's not organic,
[02:35:13.800 --> 02:35:15.960]  and I don't like to consume carcinogenics,
[02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:17.920]  but it looks fucking great,
[02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:19.360]  and it was getting people high as fuck,
[02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:21.040]  and it was just something that they weren't used to before.
[02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:22.880]  And then as it become more and more available,
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:24.560]  the price went down, down, down, down, down,
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:25.480]  now it's pretty similar.
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:26.960]  But there's another strain,
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:29.120]  and I don't know if you've got it in the UK,
[02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:30.440]  but it's called Stardog,
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:34.040]  and it's a cross between chemdog and something else,
[02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:38.680]  I don't know, but it's a highly potent, stinks,
[02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:40.680]  like it's an unbelievable strain,
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:42.520]  and that's like the go-to strain for everybody.
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:43.720]  So they grow cookie dog,
[02:35:43.720 --> 02:35:48.040]  which is Girl Scout cookies crossed Stardog.
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:52.360]  But before that was the cheese, was the Exodus cheese.
[02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:56.280]  So people only smoked lemon amnesia, amnesia haze,
[02:35:56.280 --> 02:35:57.880]  Exodus cheese or train wreck.
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:35:59.120]  They were like the main staples.
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:00.240]  And we had a lot of Dutch stuff,
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:04.360]  which was like bubble gum, white rhino, white widow,
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:07.120]  tutti frutti, old man's beard, old man's fur,
[02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:09.920]  a lot of the Dutch staples that were sent over,
[02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:12.120]  vacuum packed stuff from Holland
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:17.000]  that was sent over in the mid 2000s.
[02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:20.800]  So the Exodus cheese was,
[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:23.640]  there was one particular phenotype of the Exodus cheese
[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:27.440]  that originated in the early 90s,
[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:28.360]  but there was only one.
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:32.560]  It was a phenotype from a skunk number one plant.
[02:36:32.560 --> 02:36:34.800]  There was a debate, there was a couple of,
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:36.200]  there was another one, psychosis,
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:37.640]  which was another phenotype of it,
[02:36:37.640 --> 02:36:39.360]  but you had the one Exodus cheese
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:42.560]  that was perpetuated by the Exodus crew.
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:45.560]  And then lots and lots and lots of other people
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:49.760]  have grown other cheese varieties,
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:51.040]  and they say it's the Exodus cheese,
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:52.280]  but it's not the Exodus cheese.
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:53.960]  Big Buddha is a seed company.
[02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:58.320]  He, with greenhouse seeds,
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:00.400]  he made a deal with greenhouse seeds
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:02.080]  to send him over a phenotype,
[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:05.280]  and then they were gonna sell the seeds for the same amount.
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:07.200]  Greenhouse seeds still do the Exodus cheese.
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:09.360]  Their Exodus cheese is not the Exodus cheese.
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:12.280]  It's not even 5% of what the Exodus cheese is,
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:14.520]  the smell, the taste, the flavor, or nothing.
[02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:18.320]  To even call it Exodus cheese is an absolute sacrilege.
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:20.160]  The Big Buddha one, he's got his own cheese.
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:21.800]  It's nothing like the Exodus cheese.
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:23.600]  It's a very, very good cheese.
[02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:27.720]  You get some good phenotypes in his feminized seeds,
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:30.000]  same with greenhouse seeds, but it's not the Exodus cheese.
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:31.840]  But this is an Exodus cheese
[02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:35.520]  that we've kept for about 10 years.
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:37.880]  And one of the ways to preserve the genetics,
[02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:40.000]  instead of taking a cut of a cut of a car,
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.560]  is the original one, the original mother plant
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:45.000]  that we had of the Exodus cheese.
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:50.240]  We'll take cuttings from it and then clone those cuttings.
[02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:54.600]  But there's a method if you, from the very original plant,
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:57.840]  to trick the plant into the root regeneration
[02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:00.760]  and preserve its genetic integrity.
[02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:03.160]  You can sort of wrap a plastic bag,
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:06.200]  you might be familiar with it, around the stem of the plant.
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:09.000]  And you can moisten it and then put an elastic band
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:12.120]  around either side with some mycorrhizal fungi
[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:15.560]  or some Clonex or something along the stem
[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:18.520]  to spur on quicker root development.
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:21.080]  And then once the roots are established
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:22.600]  and they appear in the bag,
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:25.120]  you can cut the plant from the underside
[02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:28.040]  and then you will have a plant with a root system
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:31.840]  that is taken directly from the original plant.
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:34.600]  So before we do it about every nine months or so,
[02:38:34.600 --> 02:38:36.760]  before the stem becomes woody, et cetera,
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:39.040]  and there's any like genetic breakdown with the plant,
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:41.240]  instead of just taking a cut of a cut of a cut,
[02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:42.400]  getting rid of that mother plant,
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:44.080]  using one of those cuts as a mother plant
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:45.200]  and then so forth and so on.
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:48.080]  That's a lot of the way that how people do it.
[02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:50.240]  But by doing it that way, it tricks the plant
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:53.800]  into preserving its genetic integrity
[02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:57.200]  and formulating a root system from the basal
[02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:01.920]  of one of its appendages, one of the branches.
[02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:04.120]  So you can preserve the genetic makeup in the plant
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:05.520]  for a long, long time.
[02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:10.520]  And this Exodus cheese is the original Exodus cheese.
[02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:14.640]  And when I mean that this is three weeks into flower
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:18.080]  and it fucking stinks in comparison to a warehouse
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:20.640]  being full of the most dankest fucking weed
[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:22.600]  you've ever smelt in your life in full flower.
[02:39:22.600 --> 02:39:24.600]  That's how it smells now in week three.
[02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:26.920]  The pungency is overpowering, overwhelming.
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:31.920]  The flavor, the aroma, it's just a legendary plant.
[02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:37.480]  And I have tried so many other different variations
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:39.360]  throughout the years and all of the,
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:44.360]  some lovely like biscottis and sunset sherbets
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:47.440]  and cookies and all these other different things.
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:49.560]  Some beautiful, lovely flavorsome plants.
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:52.280]  And my personal opinion is there is nothing
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:56.160]  that I've ever smoked from the day I started smoking
[02:39:56.160 --> 02:39:58.720]  to this present day now doing this interview
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:02.560]  that can come close to the true Exodus cheese,
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:04.240]  which is this one here.
[02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:07.880]  And I'll always have a little bit of it around
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:11.520]  and I'll grow a different CBD variety or whatever.
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:12.960]  I'll grow for my own personal use
[02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:14.720]  and I don't smoke a vast amount.
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:18.560]  So this here, I'll probably, this is a new light,
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:19.960]  a new LED light.
[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:23.440]  I was using cobs before, but say I'll get like a pound
[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:27.400]  or a bit more out of this tent with nine plants,
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:29.440]  four ounces, four and a bit ounces per plant.
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:32.280]  So it's a decent yielding strain,
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:34.360]  but it's not the lemon meringue pie,
[02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:35.760]  which is actually next door.
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.160]  And it will last me for a long time, you know?
[02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:42.720]  So, and I'll make, I don't really eat,
[02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:44.720]  make edibles so much, but I'll make a bit of butter
[02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:45.560]  and stuff like that.
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:47.680]  So I can just have a tiny little bit and some extracts
[02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:51.120]  and some friend of mine does some oils
[02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:53.320]  and stuff and that for me as well.
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:56.320]  All of the leaves in that, we, the sugar leaves,
[02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:59.880]  I'll give over for him to make gummies and that.
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:02.320]  And he gives them out to people that have got arthritis
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:03.680]  and so forth.
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:08.680]  So we try and give back and whatever leaves
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:12.160]  that aren't used as sugar leaves,
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:13.560]  I put them into the compost pile.
[02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:16.640]  So whatever comes off the plant, all of the,
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:17.720]  I keep everything here.
[02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:21.080]  This is from what I defoliated.
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:24.240]  So I've got to throw that all into the compost bin as well.
[02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:26.240]  I only took them off a couple of days ago.
[02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:28.320]  So all that goes back into my compost pile.
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:31.440]  So nothing ever goes to waste and I'll put whatever
[02:41:31.440 --> 02:41:33.840]  I take off the plant back into the next plant
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:36.760]  and it uptakes it on the next cycle.
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:39.640]  But yeah, just had to say this cheese,
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:43.360]  if there was some way that I could fucking let you guys
[02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:45.400]  have a fucking clone of it, man.
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:47.960]  If you get the real one and this is the real one,
[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:49.920]  it's like something you've never fucking had before
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:50.760]  in your life.
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:54.400]  It is an absolute spectacular, spectacular plan.
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:56.520]  And I can't, and that's me saying a lot,
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:41:58.920]  like a lot of years I've been growing.
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:00.800]  And if there was anything that came close to it,
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:03.240]  like, oh yeah, but I grew this one plant and it was,
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:04.080]  you know, good.
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:05.400]  There's nothing, it doesn't come close to it.
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:07.560]  It's like, just ask me what's the best one you've ever
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:10.360]  smoked, exodus cheese, like best flavor, best smell.
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:12.040]  You know, not saying it's the highest,
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:14.680]  it does get you pretty high, but it's just the smell
[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:18.560]  and the flavor of it is just, it's just unique, man.
[02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:22.920]  It's the Arnold Schwarzenegger of the cannabis world
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:23.760]  in my opinion.
[02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:25.840]  So I don't know if you guys have got a favorite strain
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:27.960]  or something really spectacular.
[02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:32.480]  And it might not even be one of the known strains.
[02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:35.320]  And I don't know what cheese that you guys have smoked.
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:37.400]  It's very unlikely being in the States
[02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:39.640]  that you would have smoked the real exodus cheese.
[02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:44.160]  In fact, it would probably be completely impossible
[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:47.960]  because unless you had somebody send you a clone over
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:50.800]  that had the real one, which is very, very few people
[02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:52.400]  actually have the real exodus now,
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:53.960]  cause it's been going around for, you know,
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:42:55.320]  almost 20 years or so,
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:01.320]  to smoke a cheese derivative or some form of cheese
[02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:03.000]  that these other seed companies have done.
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:06.760]  Yeah, but to actually smoke the one exodus cheese
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:10.560]  is a completely different ballgame.
[02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:15.160]  You know, the way you're talking about it reminds me
[02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:18.640]  of the UK cheese that was passed around.
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:22.640]  Yeah, the UK cheese is like the name for the exodus cheese.
[02:43:22.640 --> 02:43:25.720]  So it was called cheese, UK cheese or exodus cheese.
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:29.440]  And exodus cheese was the, it was called exodus cheese
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:32.680]  because the team of people that first got the cut
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:35.440]  and started growing vast amounts of it
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:36.840]  were called the exodus crew.
[02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:41.840]  And they were out of Luton in near Hertfordshire in the UK.
[02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:46.600]  And that it was named the exodus cheese or AKA UK cheese.
[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:47.680]  But there was only one,
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:49.160]  there was only one that was the real one.
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:50.720]  And there was lots of other, you know,
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:54.320]  people had taken cuts and crossed it
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:56.280]  and reversed it on itself.
[02:43:56.280 --> 02:43:59.840]  And, you know, it's never the true cheese.
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:01.680]  It has genetic expressions,
[02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:03.960]  but not in the same proportions
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:08.800]  as what the original cut only UK cheese
[02:44:08.800 --> 02:44:10.280]  or exodus cheese ever had.
[02:44:10.280 --> 02:44:12.760]  So yeah, this is the one.
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:16.880]  And I wish, hopefully technology will allow a smell soon
[02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:18.920]  because you'd be blown away.
[02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:21.120]  To smell what you could smell now
[02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:23.800]  in this early stage of flower is just incomprehensible.
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:28.160]  Like it's so overwhelming that if I put my head
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:33.160]  into the tent, it's like I've jumped in a swimming pool
[02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:36.440]  of freshly cut cannabis.
[02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:40.200]  Like that's how intense and powerful the smell is
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:41.560]  that comes from this plant.
[02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:45.080]  It's really saying else, man.
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:46.480]  That's me enough talking about the cheese.
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:48.120]  I just had to pick up the cheese.
[02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:50.840]  Well, it's funny.
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:53.120]  Years back, I was down in Arizona
[02:44:53.120 --> 02:44:54.640]  visiting my daughter at college.
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:59.480]  And I went to a local guy who had, you know,
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:00.960]  his Swiss grain market.
[02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:02.640]  And he said, what do you want?
[02:45:02.640 --> 02:45:04.720]  I have cheese and I forget the other version.
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:06.640]  I said, well, let me try that cheese stuff.
[02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:08.040]  I never had that.
[02:45:08.040 --> 02:45:08.880]  Well, I smoked out.
[02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:10.520]  I was stoned the next day.
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:11.360]  I was fucking.
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:15.840]  So is that what you're talking about?
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:18.200]  It has that really powerful effect.
[02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:24.120]  It has a powerful effect, but more so with the cheese,
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:26.080]  the terpene profile.
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:28.040]  It's like when you smell it,
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:32.280]  it has a smell of like cherry and earthiness,
[02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:35.880]  sweet, musky, dank, skunky.
[02:45:35.880 --> 02:45:38.840]  And it has so many tones and so many different smells
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:40.880]  that when you rub the plant and smell it,
[02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:42.480]  or you just sit here and smell it,
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:44.240]  it's just everything's bouncing around.
[02:45:44.240 --> 02:45:47.440]  It's like someone's playing a musical instrument,
[02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:49.200]  different tones, and you can smell this
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:51.520]  and you can smell that and you can smell something else.
[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:55.640]  It's not distinct lemon terpene or something like that.
[02:45:55.640 --> 02:45:57.560]  It's such a unique flavor.
[02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:00.960]  And the taste from it is just like,
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:02.480]  it's just a wonderful, wonderful smell,
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:04.240]  wonderful taste and a wonderful high.
[02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:06.760]  And yeah, it will absolutely rock your world.
[02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:12.920]  The average THC content of it is about 20%, 15 to 20%.
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:16.560]  But the psychoactive component behind it
[02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:21.560]  and the other cannabinoids that are present within it,
[02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:27.320]  it's not just THC that gives you euphoric feelings.
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:32.400]  I can't agree with you more on that.
[02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:34.680]  I've smoked some strains
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:36.480]  that aren't even that high in THC.
[02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:39.040]  And they've actually fucked me up, right?
[02:46:39.040 --> 02:46:41.480]  And they fuck you up, man, big time.
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:46.440]  And I think that that's another piece of the education pie
[02:46:47.320 --> 02:46:50.280]  that needs to be taught to new consumers
[02:46:50.280 --> 02:46:54.560]  is that no, don't just look at the fucking THC level.
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:57.440]  And that's the big sellers out here in the dispensaries
[02:46:57.440 --> 02:47:01.440]  is high THC sells first and people don't understand
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:05.240]  that you get a much more complete and balanced euphoric
[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:08.840]  effect when you have the other minor cannabinoids
[02:47:08.840 --> 02:47:10.440]  in present.
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:11.960]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:14.920]  Anyway, so we should probably, I saw Ken,
[02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:17.480]  you're doing an awesome job behind the scenes there, buddy,
[02:47:17.480 --> 02:47:21.160]  brought up if there are any questions out there.
[02:47:21.160 --> 02:47:23.480]  I'd also love to see the audience,
[02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:24.760]  where you guys are from.
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:28.040]  I know I've seen a lot of our regulars here,
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:32.040]  but it might be nice for this doc to see
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:34.280]  where else you guys are tuning in from.
[02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:36.080]  So bring your questions forward
[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:39.320]  and also give yourself a shout out of where you are from.
[02:47:42.600 --> 02:47:44.600]  Do you see that question from D-Rick?
[02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:48.600]  What is the soil volume per plant you like?
[02:47:50.720 --> 02:47:51.560]  Is that for me?
[02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:56.560]  So me, my preferred method of growing is 30 liter pots.
[02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:01.840]  And I do that for two reasons.
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:06.840]  Is it, it allows a nice amount of nutrition
[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:10.920]  to sustain a plant throughout its entire life.
[02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:12.640]  On average, eight, nine weeks flower
[02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:14.640]  and four weeks vegetation
[02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:17.360]  without having to add anything else to it.
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:21.680]  And then it allows me to fill my space quickly.
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:27.000]  If I do a smaller number of pots, but larger pots,
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:30.760]  it would either mean multiple plants in each pot
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:33.600]  or vegging for an exceptionally long time
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:36.640]  until they were ready to flip to fill this area.
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:40.160]  So if you've got more plants, like nine in this,
[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:43.240]  if I just do a shot of the bottom, you can see.
[02:48:43.240 --> 02:48:48.240]  So I've got three rows of three, so nine 30 liter pots.
[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:53.560]  And I just lollipop the stuff up there,
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:55.760]  but that's how I've got it.
[02:48:55.760 --> 02:48:57.320]  And that's my preferred method.
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:00.960]  Just to not have to wait so long for a harvest
[02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:02.160]  because I need the medicine.
[02:49:02.160 --> 02:49:05.040]  And if I've done like really big plants,
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:07.000]  I need to do a really big veg on it.
[02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:12.520]  And I might have to veg for eight, nine weeks.
[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:14.800]  And then if I have to flower for eight, nine weeks as well,
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:16.520]  then it's 18, 20 weeks or whatever.
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:18.840]  And I need a harvest.
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:22.240]  I need to make sure I've got enough weed
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:24.760]  because I won't buy anything from the street.
[02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:25.600]  I won't smoke it,
[02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:28.040]  but I'd only smoke something I've grown myself
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:30.360]  because I know it's pure and I know it's organic
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:32.920]  and I know what it is and I know the strain
[02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:36.280]  and I know it hasn't had any chemicals or anything for it.
[02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:38.400]  It's been dried properly and cured properly
[02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:41.720]  and it hasn't had anything sprayed on it or no PGRs.
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:45.840]  So I have to make sure that I've got enough for myself.
[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:48.760]  So when I do it like this,
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:53.760]  it just allows me to do a couple of weeks veg from a clone
[02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:57.120]  and then eight weeks flowering this Exodus Cheeses.
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:49:58.760]  I ended up fucking up
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:03.360]  and putting a lemon meringue pie in the cup by mistake.
[02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:06.520]  But this is the strain that we've,
[02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:08.160]  this is the original one
[02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:10.560]  and this absolutely fucking stinks as well, man.
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:11.480]  It's fucking insane.
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:15.280]  And if you have a look on my story, on my posts,
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:17.400]  I grew, what did I do?
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:20.840]  I done four plants in 110 liter pots.
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:24.560]  That was the four pound from this space
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:26.640]  using 2000 watts of light.
[02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:27.720]  It went through the Scrognett.
[02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:29.960]  It's on a few of my,
[02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:32.680]  I'll send you guys on the Instagram the link
[02:50:33.040 --> 02:50:33.880]  so you can have a look at the plant.
[02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:35.520]  It's gargantuan, it's incredible.
[02:50:36.680 --> 02:50:41.320]  But I accidentally put one of those in with the cheese
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:42.800]  and it's more sativa dominant
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:44.360]  and it stretches up a lot more.
[02:50:44.360 --> 02:50:46.520]  So that's why it's just overcast
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:49.560]  these Exodus Cheese here a little bit.
[02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:50.840]  And I've got my other phone as well.
[02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:53.080]  It's a shame because this is my crappy phone.
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:55.080]  I should have done my other phone.
[02:50:55.080 --> 02:50:56.680]  It's got a wicked 4K camera on it.
[02:50:56.680 --> 02:50:57.920]  You could have seen things much better.
[02:50:57.920 --> 02:51:00.200]  It's not a very good camera, this one,
[02:51:00.200 --> 02:51:01.880]  but nevermind, next time.
[02:51:01.880 --> 02:51:03.680]  Don't worry, it looks good from here.
[02:51:03.680 --> 02:51:08.680]  So someone had a question about the mycorrhizae
[02:51:09.440 --> 02:51:11.480]  that you put in your product.
[02:51:11.480 --> 02:51:12.320]  Yeah.
[02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:18.160]  Yeah, so the mycorrhizae that's added to the product,
[02:51:20.280 --> 02:51:22.680]  it's added to the soil
[02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:24.440]  and we also have it in the dry amendment.
[02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:28.960]  So you can buy, we do a mycorrhizae separately
[02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:34.000]  to use for transplantation primarily.
[02:51:34.200 --> 02:51:36.800]  And I know there's a lot of debates about the mycorrhizae,
[02:51:36.800 --> 02:51:40.240]  but applying it directly to the root,
[02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:41.520]  contact with the root,
[02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:46.520]  ensures like the best chances of canalization
[02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:48.960]  to the root system.
[02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:52.880]  So we have it there to use on transplant.
[02:51:52.880 --> 02:51:55.760]  I wouldn't ever recommend to use mycorrhizae,
[02:51:55.760 --> 02:51:59.240]  any form of mycorrhizae to take cuttings with,
[02:51:59.240 --> 02:52:01.920]  because it always seems to go a bit moldy.
[02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:04.920]  A root in hormone that's in a gel form,
[02:52:04.920 --> 02:52:06.360]  like a Clonex or something,
[02:52:06.360 --> 02:52:10.280]  you know, I've tried it with loads of different mycorrhizae
[02:52:10.280 --> 02:52:14.040]  and it's just, the mycorrhizae is there to adhere
[02:52:14.040 --> 02:52:19.040]  to existing root systems and canalize the root system
[02:52:19.680 --> 02:52:24.680]  where to take a cutting, a root in hormone is needed to,
[02:52:24.720 --> 02:52:26.480]  well, it's not needed, you can do it without,
[02:52:26.480 --> 02:52:30.440]  but if you wanna try and speed up the process of cutting,
[02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:35.440]  using a gel-like hormone is much more beneficial.
[02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:38.080]  It can actually be a bit of,
[02:52:39.760 --> 02:52:42.800]  can go the opposite way if you try and use the mycorrhizae,
[02:52:42.800 --> 02:52:45.200]  it can just cause mold and rot and stuff
[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:47.920]  because it doesn't have a root system to attach to
[02:52:47.920 --> 02:52:48.760]  and to colonize.
[02:52:48.760 --> 02:52:52.320]  And in regards to actually promoting root growth
[02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:53.880]  from a cut,
[02:52:55.040 --> 02:52:58.600]  with my experience, it doesn't work well at all.
[02:52:59.520 --> 02:53:03.840]  So yeah, the mycorrhizae is just,
[02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:05.440]  is incorporated into the soil.
[02:53:05.440 --> 02:53:08.080]  So that whole process of when we had the dry amendments
[02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:09.600]  and the compost and everything else,
[02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:12.920]  the mycorrhizae is incorporated into it as well
[02:53:12.920 --> 02:53:17.920]  to start producing mycorrhizal colonies throughout the soil.
[02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:20.800]  So it's there and it's present.
[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:25.400]  And being beneficial.
[02:53:25.400 --> 02:53:28.680]  And then we incorporate into the dry amendment as well.
[02:53:28.680 --> 02:53:31.880]  So it's just something added extra in there
[02:53:31.880 --> 02:53:33.720]  that can be beneficial to the plant
[02:53:33.720 --> 02:53:38.240]  and just kickstart all those processes
[02:53:38.240 --> 02:53:41.840]  or to top it up if you're doing longer vegging plants
[02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:42.680]  or something.
[02:53:42.680 --> 02:53:47.400]  So that's the mycorrhizae that we use.
[02:53:47.400 --> 02:53:48.880]  So someone's asking you,
[02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:51.120]  how many plants do you have in that for life?
[02:53:52.440 --> 02:53:55.880]  So I've got nine, nine 30 liter pots.
[02:53:55.880 --> 02:53:57.720]  And it's a five by five, five foot five,
[02:53:57.720 --> 02:54:00.160]  five foot nine, nine, nine plants,
[02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:01.640]  nine 30 liter pots in there.
[02:54:04.320 --> 02:54:05.880]  Do you use CO2?
[02:54:07.680 --> 02:54:09.160]  I don't use any CO2.
[02:54:09.160 --> 02:54:10.800]  And this is another misconception.
[02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:14.400]  People think that adding CO2 to, you know,
[02:54:14.400 --> 02:54:17.320]  these bags that you can hang up,
[02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:22.360]  you'd be better off putting a hamster in your tent.
[02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:23.960]  You know, it would breathe out more CO2
[02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:24.800]  than one of those bags.
[02:54:24.800 --> 02:54:26.120]  It's just another market employee.
[02:54:26.120 --> 02:54:31.120]  CO2 only works in a closed sealed room.
[02:54:31.280 --> 02:54:33.880]  So if you've got an extraction like most hobbyists have
[02:54:33.880 --> 02:54:35.400]  with an intake and an outtake,
[02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:39.440]  exchanging carbon dioxide and oxygen,
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:45.560]  the CO2 isn't in a high enough volume in the room
[02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:48.640]  to actually be beneficial.
[02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:50.440]  And there's lots of other factors
[02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:54.560]  that need to be addressed as well for CO2 to be optimized.
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:57.160]  And it's a difficult thing to do,
[02:54:57.160 --> 02:54:59.080]  closed circuit rooms, closed sealed rooms.
[02:54:59.080 --> 02:55:00.360]  And that's why a lot of, you know,
[02:55:00.360 --> 02:55:03.840]  major places that grow vast amounts of cannabis
[02:55:03.840 --> 02:55:06.680]  don't use it because the returns
[02:55:06.680 --> 02:55:09.000]  that you'll get back from it when it's done properly
[02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.120]  on a large amount, then there'll be, you know,
[02:55:11.120 --> 02:55:13.520]  some returns that you can see.
[02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:17.840]  But to try and use it in a tent, like as a hobbyist,
[02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:21.880]  the CO2 is not gonna make any difference at all
[02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:23.360]  unless it's a closed circuit room.
[02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:25.720]  And the tents are not sealed, you know.
[02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:27.200]  We've got the doors open, we've got the flaps,
[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:29.240]  we've got the extraction going on and off.
[02:55:29.240 --> 02:55:33.080]  If you wanna turn your extraction off and, you know,
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:37.640]  get a CO2 fire extinguisher and absolutely
[02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:39.320]  fill the room with CO2 and enclose it
[02:55:39.320 --> 02:55:40.800]  and let it saturate, you know,
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:42.960]  an hour before the lights come on or something,
[02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:44.480]  then maybe it would have some benefit.
[02:55:44.480 --> 02:55:49.040]  But, you know, in terms of what yield
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:53.560]  it's gonna give you back,
[02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:55.640]  I just don't see any point in doing it.
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:55:57.800]  And that would only be, you'd only do it
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:55:59.480]  if it was in a closed room.
[02:55:59.480 --> 02:56:01.600]  Like if you try and add CO2 in these products,
[02:56:01.600 --> 02:56:05.280]  these bags that people hang up, and they expel CO2,
[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:08.600]  the level of CO2 that's present through the exchange
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:12.000]  of your intake and your outtake
[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:15.600]  is a great enough level.
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:19.120]  And it's also like the CO2 that these bags produce,
[02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:21.800]  yeah, they do produce CO2,
[02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:24.960]  but they're not producing enough CO2
[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:28.080]  to actually absorb and be, like,
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:32.440]  transfer into anything meaningful.
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:34.920]  You know, and like the research and the data
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:37.120]  and that for people, this is the wonderful thing
[02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:40.560]  with Google, is you can just type into Google,
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:44.600]  like CO2, cannabis room, you know,
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:47.200]  sealed rooms only, benefits, et cetera.
[02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:48.080]  How does it work?
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:50.200]  What does the temperature need to be?
[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:52.680]  When in the plant's life do I add the CO2?
[02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:55.400]  The lights on or the lights off, in veg or in flour,
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:57.920]  all of these different components that people
[02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:00.200]  that only use CO2 in closed rooms
[02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:01.800]  would have done in-depth research to
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:03.560]  and use a closed circuit room.
[02:57:03.560 --> 02:57:06.440]  Hanging a bag up, one of these breathing CO2 things,
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:08.160]  they cost a fiver, like they do nothing.
[02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:09.640]  Like you spend five pound,
[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:11.200]  is it gonna do anything to your room?
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:13.320]  No, it's not gonna do anything at all, whatsoever.
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:15.360]  So, like, and that's not my opinion.
[02:57:15.360 --> 02:57:18.280]  That's like, that's facts, like they don't do anything.
[02:57:19.360 --> 02:57:23.120]  A sealed closed circuit room with supplementary CO2
[02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:28.120]  being used correctly with the right amount of light.
[02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:31.840]  Because this is the whole thing with the PPFD
[02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:36.640]  is around nine to 1100 PPFD across the canopy
[02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:39.480]  is the maximum amount of photosynthesis
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:43.680]  that can occur without CO2.
[02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:46.440]  A lot of these lights, they call them a CO2 plus light
[02:57:46.440 --> 02:57:49.240]  because supplementary CO2 needs to be added
[02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:53.000]  to achieve these greater volumes of yield.
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.240]  But that can only be done in a closed circuit room.
[02:57:55.240 --> 02:57:59.520]  Like you can't replicate or allow the plant
[02:57:59.520 --> 02:58:02.960]  to absorb that CO2 unless you've got a closed circuit room.
[02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:04.600]  So I don't know what you guys think about that
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:07.880]  or if you've got anything different about it, but.
[02:58:07.880 --> 02:58:10.000]  Yeah, those bags are a complete waste of money.
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:13.360]  And back in the day, people would smoke blunts in their room
[02:58:13.360 --> 02:58:18.000]  and see a better reading on the stuff there.
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:22.320]  So I think now maybe a little bit cleaner,
[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:24.720]  you'd probably be able to get away with smoking a joint
[02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:27.240]  and then you don't have any of that tobacco aspect.
[02:58:27.240 --> 02:58:31.920]  But the mushroom bags were a gimmick for a long time.
[02:58:31.920 --> 02:58:32.760]  That's it, the mushroom bags.
[02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:34.880]  We spent a lot of money on those.
[02:58:34.880 --> 02:58:37.480]  And Smokey Tokey, he said earlier,
[02:58:37.480 --> 02:58:42.480]  he uses cocoa, 50%, 35% compost and then his amendments.
[02:58:43.960 --> 02:58:46.520]  So hopefully that answers that.
[02:58:46.520 --> 02:58:48.800]  We've got about two minutes left.
[02:58:48.800 --> 02:58:51.920]  So if there's any final questions out there,
[02:58:51.920 --> 02:58:53.640]  please throw them us out.
[02:58:55.640 --> 02:58:58.560]  Otherwise, I just really wanted to thank you, Doc,
[02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:01.960]  for coming on today and sharing with the crew here
[02:59:02.480 --> 02:59:06.080]  a little bit more about how UK is doing
[02:59:06.080 --> 02:59:11.080]  with both cannabis, legalization, medical use, growing.
[02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:16.600]  I mean, it's really nice to see or hear
[02:59:16.600 --> 02:59:20.640]  how another environment is compared to ours.
[02:59:20.640 --> 02:59:23.240]  I think we've got a lot of the same parallel issues
[02:59:24.440 --> 02:59:28.120]  and who knows where the fuck shit's going, right?
[02:59:28.120 --> 02:59:30.400]  I just wanna say before you think it out,
[02:59:30.400 --> 02:59:31.680]  I appreciate you invite me on.
[02:59:32.400 --> 02:59:34.360]  It was really nice to speak to like-minded people
[02:59:34.360 --> 02:59:36.240]  and non-like-minded people,
[02:59:36.240 --> 02:59:38.960]  irrespective of what your interests are.
[02:59:38.960 --> 02:59:42.280]  It's nice to speak to people who have the same interests.
[02:59:42.280 --> 02:59:45.920]  I've learned something from you guys around certain things.
[02:59:45.920 --> 02:59:48.600]  I don't, only a fool thinks that he knows everything
[02:59:48.600 --> 02:59:50.240]  and I don't think I know everything.
[02:59:50.240 --> 02:59:53.600]  So I think I know a lot, but I'm always learning.
[02:59:53.600 --> 02:59:56.360]  And that's the reason why I like to have conversations.
[02:59:57.480 --> 03:00:00.400]  Leighton and the other chap, Brian, up there as well.
[03:00:00.400 --> 03:00:01.720]  Leighton being the older gentleman,
[03:00:01.720 --> 03:00:03.280]  he's been around a little bit longer than me.
[03:00:03.280 --> 03:00:05.960]  So he'll probably know a few things that I don't.
[03:00:05.960 --> 03:00:08.600]  And I'm always, I always like to learn different things
[03:00:08.600 --> 03:00:10.160]  to just try and make a better product,
[03:00:10.160 --> 03:00:12.240]  have a better growing experience.
[03:00:12.240 --> 03:00:17.120]  And it's nice to find out something new
[03:00:17.120 --> 03:00:19.720]  that you didn't know beforehand from somebody.
[03:00:19.720 --> 03:00:21.680]  So that, I really appreciate that.
[03:00:21.680 --> 03:00:23.920]  And it's been a nice experience.
[03:00:23.920 --> 03:00:28.920]  And I hope that I wasn't too, I'm a little bit,
[03:00:28.920 --> 03:00:31.040]  I'm a little bit of a territy ADHD.
[03:00:31.040 --> 03:00:33.640]  You're all good, brother.
[03:00:33.640 --> 03:00:34.880]  You are all good.
[03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:36.560]  And I noticed in the chat,
[03:00:36.560 --> 03:00:39.160]  there was quite a few people from the UK.
[03:00:39.160 --> 03:00:41.760]  I must have seen at least 10 or 15 people.
[03:00:41.760 --> 03:00:43.200]  So that's great.
[03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:45.720]  Hopefully they'll find this podcast
[03:00:45.720 --> 03:00:47.000]  and some of the other ones that are put out
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:48.960]  on the future canvas project.
[03:00:48.960 --> 03:00:52.120]  Cause hopefully they're good resources for you.
[03:00:52.120 --> 03:00:53.680]  Yeah, thanks, Susan.
[03:00:53.680 --> 03:00:55.280]  We do another one.
[03:00:55.280 --> 03:00:56.880]  If you invite me again to another one,
[03:00:56.880 --> 03:00:58.200]  you want to have a chat or say,
[03:00:58.520 --> 03:01:01.480]  you're more than welcome to discuss something else.
[03:01:03.200 --> 03:01:05.600]  I want to also add my thank you.
[03:01:05.600 --> 03:01:07.960]  I'm up in Canada myself.
[03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:10.880]  And I can relate to a lot of the things
[03:01:10.880 --> 03:01:13.200]  that you have going on there.
[03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:16.360]  It was wonderful to have you on, great information.
[03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:17.360]  Oh, thanks dude.
[03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:21.400]  I've only just seen your face now, Ken.
[03:01:21.400 --> 03:01:25.840]  Like I'd seen Leighton and rubber ducky,
[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:28.040]  but Ken, I think he did appear one time,
[03:01:28.880 --> 03:01:29.720]  but it's a full screen now.
[03:01:29.720 --> 03:01:30.720]  And it's like, yeah, Ken,
[03:01:30.720 --> 03:01:32.440]  nice to meet you as well, man.
[03:01:32.440 --> 03:01:33.280]  Oh, thank you.
[03:01:33.280 --> 03:01:35.760]  I try to hide in the background and it's not my show.
[03:01:35.760 --> 03:01:37.480]  I'm just doing production back end.
[03:01:37.480 --> 03:01:40.520]  So give him Peter a break.
[03:01:42.040 --> 03:01:44.280]  He is Oz, he's the guy behind the curtain.
[03:01:47.920 --> 03:01:49.320]  Awesome, man.
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:52.600]  All right, well, I think we're at a good point
[03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:53.440]  to wrap it up.
[03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:55.280]  Peter, did you have any housekeeping
[03:01:55.280 --> 03:01:57.040]  that you wanted to come on and talk about?
[03:01:57.080 --> 03:02:01.680]  Before we go dark, if he's even there.
[03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:05.440]  I know he's actually, he's gone already,
[03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:08.480]  but we've got a bunch of shows coming up.
[03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:12.040]  You got Chris Guerrero's always on.
[03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:14.320]  We've got London coming on out of Canada.
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:16.120]  You got my show on Monday.
[03:02:16.120 --> 03:02:18.520]  And of course next week with Marco and Brian
[03:02:18.520 --> 03:02:20.600]  and you and Brian as well, Leighton.
[03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:23.920]  So there's so much content coming out guys.
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:27.520]  Just make sure you've got your post notifications on
[03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:30.680]  so that you find out when the shows are coming out.
[03:02:30.680 --> 03:02:33.920]  Sign up for both FCP and FCP2.
[03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:36.680]  There's a lot of content going on over there, guys.
[03:02:36.680 --> 03:02:39.480]  Never hesitate to learn and grow
[03:02:39.480 --> 03:02:41.960]  and listen to as many voices as you can.
[03:02:43.440 --> 03:02:45.320]  Wise words, my friend, wise words.
[03:02:45.320 --> 03:02:49.040]  Well, Brian, did you have anything that you needed to add
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:51.440]  for house cleaning on your end?
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:53.680]  I just wanted to thank Dr. Organics again.
[03:02:55.240 --> 03:02:57.600]  Hopefully, sir, it sounds like you're gonna be the catalyst
[03:02:57.600 --> 03:02:59.600]  for a variety of things.
[03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:02.440]  Everybody that's a part of the Future Cannabis Project,
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:05.520]  our end goal is that it's cheaper, pennies on the dollar.
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:07.040]  We use all of that same verbiage
[03:03:07.040 --> 03:03:10.640]  because we want the community to be as educated as possible
[03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:12.840]  so that they can then choose their own path.
[03:03:12.840 --> 03:03:15.600]  And that's really the goal of a Future Cannabis Project
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:18.160]  is for that individual to pick their own path
[03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:20.080]  because there was an entire,
[03:03:20.080 --> 03:03:22.240]  almost felt like an entire decade
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:23.880]  where we were told how to grow.
[03:03:23.880 --> 03:03:25.360]  This is done week by week.
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:27.320]  These are the amendments that you need.
[03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:29.120]  And then everybody was so secretive
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:30.760]  because once you've kind of figured out
[03:03:30.760 --> 03:03:32.600]  those amendments for your environment,
[03:03:32.600 --> 03:03:34.080]  you don't wanna share that with anybody
[03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:35.600]  outside of your inner circle.
[03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:37.200]  So just appreciate you sharing
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:39.720]  and showing behind the curtains.
[03:03:39.720 --> 03:03:41.600]  We appreciate it and we look forward
[03:03:41.600 --> 03:03:44.840]  to obviously having you on the show again, brother.
[03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:46.400]  Thank you, man.
[03:03:46.400 --> 03:03:47.800]  All right, on that note,
[03:03:47.800 --> 03:03:50.160]  Ken, are you ready for the countdown?
[03:03:50.160 --> 03:03:52.880]  I surely am, my fingers poised.
[03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:54.880]  Three, two, one.
