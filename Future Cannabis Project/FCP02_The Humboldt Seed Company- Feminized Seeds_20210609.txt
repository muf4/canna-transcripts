You mentioned just feminizing in general
You know just to go back to like our roots. I mean we didn't really breed
we didn't make feminized seeds for a long long time and
to be honest like we kind of I
don't think anybody dragged us into it kicking and screaming but
That is a good metaphor for like, you know, I was
didn't trust it, you know for quite some time and
We played around with it there were certain
Things in the past that really bothered me like there was only certain genetics that that would do the sex reversal
that's required to do feminizing and
That was a red flag right out the gate because it's like if you're only
using things that
readily
Essentially hermaphrodite then of course you're gonna pass that hermaphroditic trait
on
So it wasn't until we kind of like we're able to master
the full-blown
sex reversal that's required to make feminized seeds and
just
Get that to the point in which we could do it. Like we've yet to come across a genetic that we can't
Fully reverse from a female to a male. And so now we've figured it out. We've got our
Our formula so to speak of how to turn a beautiful
female plant that we've
you know vetted and R&D'd and
seen the flower and even smoked the flower and know that it's like fire and
now we can basically just turn that into a male and
It
It was a realization that like wow, you know, this really gives us as breeders a
lot more
kind of
control and power over what we're putting into the progeny of this breeding project because
now we can go and and pick pheno hunt and pick what we call a receiver and
That's what we've always done for 20 plus years. We've like found
You know, it was like a long time ago
I can't even remember when that we started taking cuts off our
best looking plants and keeping them and then watching them bud out and
Being like, all right, and then, you know having the cuts and veg and alive and well like pheno hunting
That's what you do basically and then, you know
Smoking it testing it when the labs came in and picking that one and being like, all right pull cut number
You know 10 C or whatever the hell we coded it. So now we can do that and
Back in the day, we would just go and find a male that like looked good and smelled good
And it was like, you know
I would rub stems and you know how I remember that a lot of it
I'd come back and my nose would be like red with the because you know how cannabis has those little hairs like the
Microscopic but the little if hair sissle it hairs
Yeah, and so like I'd be smelling to find that right turpin, but that's the only way to know if
the male has the
inherited the traits that you need to continue that the breed the trait, you know
And so you'd be smelling those stems a lot unless you want to let all your males just grow out
But obviously that's like a major risk. You gotta kind of figure it out before there
well, and even then like you're looking at male flower and it's like you can smell it a little bit more than but
it's still not like being able to like choose a
Beautiful female and use that to make pollen, you know, it's just such a more powerful way to breed and
It really was the hemp seed
industry that
kind of gave us data to back up like
Because you know fem seeds have had for a long time kind of this
Stereotype that they her more and and I'm not like here to make an argument really one way or another but
It's been a mixed reputation
it has a mixed reputation and I honestly think it was like largely because initially they were being made from a
specific genetic that would
Do that readily it would reverse sex readily and it was like that just didn't seem right and so
Once that wasn't a requirement to like use your like half of your whole genetic was made out of this thing
that would reverse sex readily then, you know that made a lot more sense to us as breeders and
but then industrial hemp was like
Immediately just like we can't do this with clones because
we're trying to grow acres and acres and
so companies like Oregon CBD, for example, just started doing real
trial and analysis of
You know rates of hermaphrodism and stuff like that and
It was like well, you know we grew out
50,000 and we had to cut down five
And it was like that's not that bad, you know
So it became really clear that there wasn't
You know, and if you do regular seeds you might have to cut down
15 I mean aside from the normal males, but it's like that the rate of
Issues was the same essentially whether it was a male or a female
so it wasn't the
Feminizing that was actually causing the issue
It was just the fact that you know
You're never gonna grow a field of 50,000 regular seeds if you have to sex them
Yeah, well, and I mean there's problems even when it comes to sexing even the best do it
I think was it mean gene that started the joke of the reggae males
You know, it happens to the best of them with regular seed you really it's all about vigilance
Constantly gotta be walking through your field and you got to check your plants it can happen to you with clones
It can happen to you with fems and it can happen to you at the regs
It's like we all went to reggae on the river, which was always like the second week of August or no
It's the first first weekend of August and you'd come back and there'd be that reggae on the river male that you missed
You know like while you were gone setting up your camp and raging all weekend doing the party
The balls dropped that's so to speak it was busy destroying your crop while you were having fun
I did I did it once and I remember that day and I'll always remember that day. It was August 13th
Yeah, and you came back that was the day that I was like, oh wow, I fucked up. Yeah
One got away. Yep. Yeah, it's happened to the best of us
You know, there's lots and lots of learning curves and that's why you know
I mean, obviously he has so much more experience than me and you both do as well
but even for me
I feel really fortunate to have been a part of this and to have kind of like worked out some of those kinks that every
single grower experiences along the road because you can read all the books ever but that doesn't mean that you're gonna
Walk by that potential male plant and notice it right off the bat
You can't you know
You can't read your way into training your eyes to catch something like that and there's a lot of instances
You gotta just really know what you're looking for
