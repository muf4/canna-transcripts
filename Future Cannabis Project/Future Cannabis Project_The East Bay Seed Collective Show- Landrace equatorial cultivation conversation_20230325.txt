[00:01.150 --> 00:08.150]  Okay, hello everybody and welcome to the East Bay Seed Collective show. We're doing something
[00:08.150 --> 00:15.430]  a little differently. We have our guest, we're pre-recording our show and our guest is Steve
[00:15.430 --> 00:23.190]  from Potent Ponics and he is joining us from Thailand. Thank you very much for accommodating
[00:23.190 --> 00:24.190]  me in your schedule.
[00:24.190 --> 00:30.470]  Yeah, thanks for doing the recorded show. I know it was a bit of a, a bit of a thing
[00:30.470 --> 00:34.590]  to try and coordinate, but I apologize for not being able to do it on your normal time,
[00:34.590 --> 00:35.910]  but thanks for having me on.
[00:35.910 --> 00:43.990]  No, man, it's all good. I mean, two in the morning is, is, is asking quite a bit. So
[00:43.990 --> 00:49.190]  my first icebreaker question, do you want to do a softball or do you want to jump in?
[00:49.190 --> 00:51.630]  Whatever you want to do, it's all good.
[00:51.630 --> 00:58.230]  All right, let's start with the, I like this to jump in with the kind of a deep question.
[00:58.230 --> 01:04.550]  I assume that you've been in the cannabis industry for a while. And what I'm really
[01:04.550 --> 01:10.230]  curious is how do you balance work with anything outside of cannabis?
[01:10.230 --> 01:18.190]  I mean, mostly, most of my, my universe revolves around cannabis really. Like I don't, once
[01:18.190 --> 01:23.670]  in a while I'll take a short vacation or a weekend away, but it's like, I don't know.
[01:23.670 --> 01:27.150]  I spend a little bit of time maybe playing a little video games here and there. I enjoy
[01:27.150 --> 01:33.110]  hiking and foraging, like mushroom hunting and stuff like that. And out here in Thailand,
[01:33.110 --> 01:38.430]  looking for snakes. I love photographing snakes and stuff like that. So, and fishing, but
[01:38.430 --> 01:42.990]  other than that, most of the time it's just focused on my work. Like I enjoy what I'm
[01:42.990 --> 01:47.550]  doing. I'm working on a book on cannabis and a bunch of other stuff. So it's kind of like,
[01:47.550 --> 01:52.390]  I really get a break or I'm listening to like stuff to make, to get better at my job. I
[01:52.390 --> 01:56.510]  listen to other people that I enjoy listening to in terms of learning from and trying to
[01:56.510 --> 02:01.070]  always take in new ideas. So I don't know. I don't really give myself a break, but I
[02:01.070 --> 02:04.990]  don't really not like what, you know, when you like what you do all day, you don't really
[02:04.990 --> 02:06.950]  mind.
[02:06.950 --> 02:14.610]  Now like for me, I started as an indoor guy and probably had, you know, had plants going
[02:14.610 --> 02:22.230]  for maybe almost 10 years before like my lights were ever, you know, fully shut off. Then
[02:23.070 --> 02:26.070]  I moved to like kind of more of an outdoor person, which was nice because, you know,
[02:26.070 --> 02:31.190]  during the different outdoor seasons, you kind of are doing different things. Thailand
[02:31.190 --> 02:34.310]  is equatorial, correct? Or is that, is it sub equatorial?
[02:34.310 --> 02:40.030]  No, we're full blown equatorial. Yeah.
[02:40.030 --> 02:45.190]  So that would mean basically you're growing year round. Is that correct? Is there any
[02:45.190 --> 02:47.630]  like downtime?
[02:47.630 --> 02:51.670]  So we do have a dry season and a wet season, and you do have to kind of account for that
[02:51.710 --> 02:57.470]  when you're growing. So the dry season here tends to be a little bit cooler. It starts
[02:57.470 --> 03:02.190]  around September, October, and then goes until around this time, like it's just starting
[03:02.190 --> 03:06.630]  to break into the wet season right around now. So, you know, by April it really starts
[03:06.630 --> 03:13.310]  to swing into the other road. And by May it's raining every day again. And then you have
[03:13.310 --> 03:17.070]  the rainy season, which is the other half of the year. And, you know, it's much more
[03:17.070 --> 03:22.470]  humid and you kind of have to have strains that are much more considerate of those types
[03:22.470 --> 03:26.430]  of things and much more, you know, humid and mold tolerant during that time. And then much
[03:26.430 --> 03:31.610]  more, you know, dry tolerant during the other time. So you just kind of have to have two
[03:31.610 --> 03:36.470]  different sets of plants really for the different times of year.
[03:36.470 --> 03:42.950]  That sounds kind of fun. Is that also why I was looking on your feed that you guys were
[03:42.950 --> 03:46.430]  in greenhouses? Is that also the reason why it's for the wet season?
[03:46.790 --> 03:51.070]  Yeah, just, you know, keep the rain off the plants and allow us to keep going. And then
[03:51.070 --> 03:55.390]  also to pump a bunch of air through there, right? Even if it's kind of more humid, if
[03:55.390 --> 03:58.910]  I can keep that air moving, you know, through those plants, you know, we can totally deal
[03:58.910 --> 04:04.310]  with that even if it's, you know, 70% humidity, you know, as long as that leaf surface is
[04:04.310 --> 04:07.310]  dry, you know, we can kind of get away with that.
[04:08.310 --> 04:18.470]  Interesting. Let's go into the places that you've grown. Let's start with that. So you
[04:18.470 --> 04:23.070]  were saying just briefly, where have you grown cannabis?
[04:23.070 --> 04:29.510]  Sure. So I grew up in the Philadelphia area and kind of cut my teeth out there and then
[04:29.510 --> 04:36.470]  ended up out in Colorado and California. Also spent some time growing down in Jamaica, both
[04:36.550 --> 04:42.310]  on the west end of the island and up in the Montego Bay area. And that was a lot of fun.
[04:42.550 --> 04:47.110]  I learned a lot from that and a lot of different experiences growing up in the hills there.
[04:47.110 --> 04:51.510]  Spent two weeks just on the south side of the island, just learning all I could from
[04:51.510 --> 04:57.310]  the guys up there. That was a blast when I was starting off. And then I've also grown
[04:57.310 --> 05:03.270]  out in Africa as well. I spent some time in Zimbabwe on an old tobacco plantation where
[05:03.310 --> 05:07.670]  they had kind of taken over and were turning that into a cannabis facility. That was up
[05:07.670 --> 05:11.590]  until COVID. If it wasn't for COVID, that would have taken off and the stuff in South
[05:11.590 --> 05:16.790]  Africa would have gone much better. But with COVID happening and all that stuff, it kind
[05:16.790 --> 05:21.110]  of threw a wrench in all that, you know, and I caught one of the last flights out of the
[05:21.110 --> 05:27.470]  country to get out of there. So that was a little bit scary, but made it back in time.
[05:27.470 --> 05:32.470]  And then now here in Thailand, which is a whole different experience. It's a little
[05:32.470 --> 05:37.670]  bit more brutal on the heat side here than anywhere else I've been in terms of combo
[05:37.670 --> 05:44.510]  of heat and humidity, but still doable. Just a little bit rougher than just about anywhere
[05:44.510 --> 05:47.390]  else that I've grown for sure.
[05:47.390 --> 05:55.710]  So I live in the Bay Area in California and from what I've gathered, it seems like growing
[05:55.710 --> 06:01.790]  in the tropics is more difficult than growing in California.
[06:01.790 --> 06:08.590]  Significantly more difficult. Yeah. You have six to eight times the amount of different
[06:08.590 --> 06:14.950]  species of insects. You have molds that appear much faster. You kind of have to always be
[06:14.950 --> 06:19.670]  putting on different probiotics. So every other day we spray the plants with something.
[06:19.670 --> 06:24.710]  So one day it might be Uribaciana, the next day it might be Metarizum, the next day it
[06:24.710 --> 06:30.990]  might be a combo product. We have another one that has six different types of beneficial
[06:30.990 --> 06:36.310]  fungi that will kill different insects. And then we sometimes will use spinosad, at least
[06:36.310 --> 06:44.310]  on the moms, or we'll use some other natural based pest control for the veg stuff. And
[06:44.310 --> 06:50.910]  then in flower, obviously we're just going to stick to just some microbial mold controls,
[06:50.910 --> 06:55.470]  but we have different species than the stuff that you guys use over there in the States
[06:55.470 --> 07:00.390]  when it comes to those, but they're very similar in terms of application. And obviously at
[07:00.390 --> 07:04.150]  the end of flower, you're not going to use anything, but that tends to work really well.
[07:04.150 --> 07:09.150]  I mean, we're not having many issues. We're also adding in things like Lactobacillus and
[07:09.150 --> 07:14.190]  some of the other beneficial stuff from Cree Natural Farming, as well as IPMO, which is
[07:14.190 --> 07:19.990]  like a modified version of IMO that works as a pesticide for killing insects really
[07:20.070 --> 07:24.710]  well, where we take a third of the rice and replace it with insect frass. And we have
[07:24.710 --> 07:28.710]  a whole video series on the YouTube channel on that as well. If you're looking for a new
[07:28.710 --> 07:33.430]  addition to your pesticide stuff, that's something that you can create yourself, you know, something
[07:33.430 --> 07:37.430]  you can harvest yourself, it's something you're reliant on a store or anything like that for.
[07:37.430 --> 07:42.630]  So we really had a good luck with all that stuff. We really haven't had too many issues,
[07:42.630 --> 07:47.070]  maybe a little bit of issues here and there with thrips after wind storms. They're kind
[07:47.070 --> 07:50.590]  of getting kicked up into the wind. And it seems like after that, we have to spray for
[07:50.590 --> 07:55.310]  them for a week or two to get them back under control. But other than that, we really haven't
[07:55.310 --> 07:59.870]  had anything too crazy. You know, a little bit of whack-a-mole here and there with one
[07:59.870 --> 08:05.150]  or two things on the outdoor plants, but nothing, nothing too wild, at least so far.
[08:05.150 --> 08:14.150]  Awesome. Where did you discover adding insect frass to your Lactobacillus?
[08:14.390 --> 08:17.910]  We don't actually add it to Lactobacillus, we add it to the IMO collections.
[08:20.950 --> 08:27.830]  So when I was working in Zimbabwe, when the COVID hit or started to take off, they sealed the
[08:27.830 --> 08:32.870]  borders and we kind of got cut off from imports, right? Like whatever was in the country is
[08:32.870 --> 08:39.190]  whatever was left and that didn't last all that long. So we kind of had to come up with a solution.
[08:39.190 --> 08:43.830]  So I hit up Chris Trump and he was like, Hey, I had really good luck with this with weevils
[08:44.070 --> 08:47.350]  why don't you try it? And it worked really well against the grasshoppers we were dealing with in
[08:47.350 --> 08:53.270]  Zimbabwe and it totally, you know, annihilated them out of the field that we were working on
[08:53.270 --> 08:58.630]  that we did the first trial with. So we came back after COVID and used that again a couple
[08:58.630 --> 09:05.430]  of times in Oklahoma, again for treating the grasshoppers and what's it called? The,
[09:05.510 --> 09:13.510]  another beetle, blister beetles. And what was the other one? Leafhoppers. It worked really well on
[09:13.510 --> 09:18.550]  all three of those in Oklahoma. So those are some other things that we've had really good luck with
[09:18.550 --> 09:23.430]  as well as Japanese beetles, but that really seems to work incredibly well. And again, we have a
[09:23.430 --> 09:28.230]  whole 20 minute video series where it kind of goes step by step through that whole process.
[09:29.190 --> 09:31.510]  That's awesome. I definitely need to check that out.
[09:31.510 --> 09:38.870]  So it sounds like there's a fair amount of chewing insects in Thailand. Is that right? Or I mean,
[09:38.870 --> 09:43.670]  just in general, in the tropics, there's a bunch of moving, chewing animals that are kind of, you
[09:43.670 --> 09:50.470]  can't really kill them and you can't really spray poison on the plant that they're going to eat
[09:50.470 --> 09:57.430]  because that's poisonous. And I guess you would use like a greenhouse or something like that.
[09:57.990 --> 10:02.470]  Absolutely. Yeah. It's only really the thrips that can blow through the screen that we're really
[10:02.470 --> 10:08.710]  having any kind of occasional issue with as far as entry. And even then it's a really minor issue.
[10:08.710 --> 10:13.590]  You know, they're, oh no, they discolored the lowest leaf on the plant. Like, not like, oh no,
[10:13.590 --> 10:18.870]  they're mulling it down. And so it's really hard to get into the plant. And so it's really hard to
[10:18.870 --> 10:23.190]  get into the plant. And so it's really hard to get into the plant. And so it's really hard to get
[10:23.990 --> 10:28.150]  leaves on the plant. Like, not like, oh no, they're, they're mulling the crop, you know,
[10:29.990 --> 10:33.990]  the biggest issue is that they're the, it's the end of the dry season. It's only rained here once
[10:33.990 --> 10:40.870]  since October. So we have the only green plants left anywhere around. So they're just looking for
[10:40.870 --> 10:48.230]  water really. Right, right. I had a friend and he would call them good luck thrips, because,
[10:49.590 --> 10:52.230]  you know, because he didn't have rude aphids and he didn't have broad mites,
[10:52.230 --> 10:54.150]  He didn't have spider mites.
[10:54.150 --> 10:56.510]  He's like, I just have a few good luck thrips.
[10:56.510 --> 10:58.310]  We're okay, it's not too bad.
[10:58.310 --> 11:05.190]  So I always called them the good luck thrips.
[11:05.190 --> 11:08.190]  What things did you learn in Jamaica?
[11:08.190 --> 11:11.710]  In Jamaica, they do a lot of actually one of the interesting things.
[11:11.710 --> 11:16.590]  So they'll take a bunch of fruit skins and then mix that with milk.
[11:16.590 --> 11:21.870]  And then they'll ferment that for 21 days and make like a finisher to as like a terpene
[11:21.870 --> 11:22.870]  booster.
[11:22.870 --> 11:25.070]  And that seemed to work pretty well.
[11:25.070 --> 11:29.550]  And they use that like week two, week to week four in flower to kind of get the plants to
[11:29.550 --> 11:32.110]  really burst out.
[11:32.110 --> 11:34.470]  And that was kind of an interesting thing.
[11:34.470 --> 11:36.590]  It seemed to also kind of increase the bug resistance.
[11:36.590 --> 11:42.270]  I don't know how that worked, but they certainly when they sprayed it on the plants and veg
[11:42.270 --> 11:46.430]  even seemed to make a bit of a difference in terms of what was getting eaten.
[11:46.430 --> 11:47.430]  That was really interesting.
[11:47.430 --> 11:52.510]  One of the other interesting things, when they do large scale seed plantings, we'll
[11:52.510 --> 11:59.150]  take all these seeds and plant like three or four of them in each hole all across the
[11:59.150 --> 12:00.630]  hillside.
[12:00.630 --> 12:05.790]  And then on week three and week four after germination, once they pop up, all the tall
[12:05.790 --> 12:09.030]  ones are the boys and the shorter ones are the girls.
[12:09.030 --> 12:12.950]  And all the tall ones, they'll just pull all of those out.
[12:12.950 --> 12:19.190]  And then they get rid of like 99.9% of the males by doing that, which blew my mind because
[12:19.190 --> 12:21.150]  I never knew that was even possible.
[12:21.150 --> 12:23.270]  But it only works in their 12-12 conditions.
[12:23.270 --> 12:26.830]  It won't work if you're running 16 or whatever.
[12:26.830 --> 12:31.190]  You're certainly going to notice a difference with your males, but not that kind of instant
[12:31.190 --> 12:35.910]  yes or no kind of answer, which really blew me away.
[12:35.910 --> 12:39.710]  No one had ever taught me that in the West at least.
[12:39.710 --> 12:40.710]  Interesting.
[12:40.750 --> 12:45.110]  That's kind of how I do my selecting now.
[12:45.110 --> 12:52.190]  I know I'm also selecting out a few of the outlying females that are really tall, but
[12:52.190 --> 13:04.950]  that is I'll plant a bunch and usually going into veg or maybe like three weeks into veg,
[13:04.950 --> 13:09.710]  the top 25% I end up just kind of culling and just kind of constantly culling the top
[13:09.710 --> 13:10.710]  25.
[13:10.710 --> 13:14.830]  And I usually have about 75% females.
[13:14.830 --> 13:22.470]  And then also a lot of the males that come in later, I like using for breeding anyways,
[13:22.470 --> 13:27.470]  because they are a little bit stockier for me.
[13:27.470 --> 13:31.390]  So yeah, I do also use that technique.
[13:31.390 --> 13:37.070]  In Jamaica, what is up with the strain selection out there?
[13:37.070 --> 13:40.870]  Because I know that there's pressures from outside sources.
[13:40.870 --> 13:46.910]  There's also land race or heirloom Jamaican strains and combinations of the two.
[13:46.910 --> 13:50.830]  There's no land race left on that island.
[13:50.830 --> 13:53.110]  There wasn't any in 2016 when I was there.
[13:53.110 --> 13:54.110]  It was all gone.
[13:54.110 --> 13:57.430]  It was all basically hybrid of Dutch and-
[13:57.430 --> 14:01.070]  Yeah, all of it was hybridized.
[14:01.070 --> 14:02.070]  All of it was westernized.
[14:02.070 --> 14:05.150]  And you can go, I have videos up from it too on YouTube.
[14:05.150 --> 14:08.030]  All of it was westernized, hybridized completely.
[14:08.030 --> 14:09.030]  Interesting.
[14:09.030 --> 14:12.270]  I haven't seen anything.
[14:12.270 --> 14:16.950]  Maybe, maybe, maybe a little bit up in the Blue Mountains.
[14:16.950 --> 14:21.270]  If there's anything left, it's on the eastern side of the island where it hasn't been quite
[14:21.270 --> 14:22.270]  so polluted.
[14:22.270 --> 14:26.790]  But on the western side of the island, it's so many tourists have brought seeds in there
[14:26.790 --> 14:32.550]  and they themselves have brought in a lot of weed seeds to boost yields that it's just
[14:32.550 --> 14:33.550]  all ruined.
[14:34.230 --> 14:37.670]  There is no land race Jamaican anything left in my opinion.
[14:37.670 --> 14:38.670]  Interesting.
[14:38.670 --> 14:44.630]  So like if a tour- so me as a tourist, I've been to Jamaica.
[14:44.630 --> 14:52.030]  Gosh, the last time was like 12, maybe 12, 13 years ago.
[14:52.030 --> 14:54.950]  Do you think the scene was different then than it is now?
[14:54.950 --> 14:58.270]  No, it's been ruined for a while.
[14:58.270 --> 15:00.030]  So what was I smoking back then?
[15:00.110 --> 15:05.550]  I mean, it definitely was quite a bit different than what I smoke here.
[15:05.550 --> 15:10.070]  I mean, I'm sure it still has some notes of some other stuff, but I'm just talking about
[15:10.070 --> 15:11.070]  like pure stuff.
[15:11.070 --> 15:17.750]  But compared to like what I've seen in Thailand and Africa, it's not even close.
[15:17.750 --> 15:21.670]  Like it was very clearly had some outside genetics to it.
[15:21.670 --> 15:22.670]  I see.
[15:22.670 --> 15:28.710]  Junkiness and size and how quickly it finishes under the tropical- because none of the tropical
[15:28.750 --> 15:31.270]  stuff that's from there finishes in eight weeks.
[15:31.270 --> 15:32.270]  You know what I mean?
[15:32.270 --> 15:33.270]  Yeah.
[15:33.270 --> 15:34.270]  Like-
[15:34.270 --> 15:40.110]  So there's stuff in Jamaica that's finishing like eight to 10 weeks now?
[15:40.110 --> 15:45.150]  Dude, when I was there in 2016, they had a strain called 48 and that would finish in
[15:45.150 --> 15:46.950]  like 50 days.
[15:46.950 --> 15:47.950]  Wow.
[15:47.950 --> 15:55.110]  They were from seed to harvest, they were doing like 75, 80 days of really fast turnovers.
[15:55.110 --> 16:00.190]  So the genetics are basically now hybrid small around the world, but because of the
[16:00.190 --> 16:07.750]  environmental influence, I mean, do they have like a more modern look to them or does it
[16:07.750 --> 16:11.150]  still seem like tropical bud?
[16:11.150 --> 16:15.550]  I mean, they just look like a hybrid.
[16:15.550 --> 16:20.910]  So they still have some of that fluffiness and some of that original sativa structure
[16:20.910 --> 16:27.750]  with smaller buds that are kind of more spaced out on the plant, but they're much more dense
[16:27.750 --> 16:33.470]  and tend to have more mold problems and stuff like that than they kind of should really
[16:33.470 --> 16:34.470]  for that kind of area.
[16:34.470 --> 16:39.310]  You also don't have that uniform, like for instance, in Thailand here, the valley I'm
[16:39.310 --> 16:44.790]  in, in Phet Shibun Valley, all the stuff that I can get from the locals is like very lemony
[16:44.790 --> 16:45.790]  dominant.
[16:45.790 --> 16:50.630]  But if I go up to like Karat or a little bit farther up north, it switches to more
[16:50.630 --> 16:55.510]  and more mango dominant because that's what's more resistant to the mold or the insects
[16:55.510 --> 16:56.510]  or whatever in that area.
[16:56.510 --> 17:01.270]  And then if we go all the way up to like Chiang Rai, Chiang Rai, you start to get some stuff
[17:01.270 --> 17:04.150]  has like some sandalwood notes and some other stuff like that.
[17:04.150 --> 17:09.590]  So because that's working up there, but you don't have that kind of like zonal thing where
[17:09.590 --> 17:14.750]  I can smoke it and immediately kind of have an idea of what area it came from in Jamaica
[17:14.750 --> 17:20.590]  because it's all the guys for a long time have just been focused on export because they
[17:20.590 --> 17:25.550]  already have plenty of stuff coming in from South America that they're also repackaging
[17:25.550 --> 17:28.550]  aside from weed.
[17:28.550 --> 17:31.350]  I've seen it down there.
[17:31.350 --> 17:33.790]  So they're just focused on money, right?
[17:33.790 --> 17:37.990]  Like they're just trying to get paid and bulk out.
[17:37.990 --> 17:42.070]  And so they had no reason to save any of that stuff.
[17:42.270 --> 17:47.310]  And even some like, maybe you'll find a small Rasta village or something that like has some
[17:47.310 --> 17:48.310]  old land race left.
[17:48.310 --> 17:52.590]  Like maybe you'll get lucky on that, but that's going to be the only way you're going to find
[17:52.590 --> 17:53.910]  anything left down there.
[17:53.910 --> 17:57.630]  And even that I would still be surprised if they didn't have some pollen that blew in
[17:57.630 --> 18:01.590]  because people are pollinating like crazy down there.
[18:01.590 --> 18:03.710]  And that wind, I mean, it'll blow in the wind there.
[18:03.710 --> 18:06.230]  You get five, 10 mile an hour winds all day long there.
[18:06.230 --> 18:09.830]  So you never quite know where your seeds came from.
[18:10.230 --> 18:12.750]  Interesting, interesting.
[18:14.030 --> 18:15.670]  What did you like smoking in Jamaica?
[18:15.870 --> 18:18.870]  Like, was there anything that that stood out to you that you thought was pretty nice?
[18:21.390 --> 18:25.910]  There was some definitely some interesting cultivars when it came to like fuchsia purple
[18:25.910 --> 18:31.270]  hairs and like purple structures of the plant and purple flowers that I hadn't seen
[18:31.270 --> 18:33.750]  anywhere else and still haven't seen anywhere else.
[18:34.990 --> 18:37.590]  But that was really maybe the only thing that really stood out.
[18:37.630 --> 18:41.030]  Flavor wise, it was all pretty middle of the road.
[18:42.430 --> 18:48.750]  And do you think that's from the like the genetics or like the cultivation environment
[18:48.750 --> 18:52.990]  and like lack of infrastructure type of thing that's going on?
[18:53.870 --> 18:57.830]  I think it's just because they're just it's kind of like a bunch of rocks.
[18:57.830 --> 19:02.990]  Like if you go back and even check out the video I did, there's not a single pound of
[19:02.990 --> 19:05.510]  anything in that field, like four acre field, right?
[19:05.510 --> 19:07.270]  Every plant is like a different pheno.
[19:07.990 --> 19:12.150]  So as a breeder, it's like heaven, right?
[19:13.030 --> 19:17.550]  But if as someone trying to resell flower, it's like a schizophrenic mess.
[19:18.150 --> 19:22.470]  Right. So I have like the two ways to look at that.
[19:22.550 --> 19:25.030]  So there's no consistency in anything.
[19:25.030 --> 19:28.750]  So it's hard for anybody to kind of breed anything out.
[19:28.750 --> 19:34.110]  It's all like a bunch of like mud muddled down brown colored, not brown strains.
[19:34.110 --> 19:37.830]  But like if you take all the different colors, right, and you mix them, you get brown.
[19:38.190 --> 19:42.470]  So you don't you don't have any real uniqueness to it.
[19:42.470 --> 19:44.110]  It's all been mashed together.
[19:44.110 --> 19:46.190]  And they're just looking for size of bud really.
[19:47.030 --> 19:49.470]  I see. Interesting.
[19:50.310 --> 19:51.750]  At least what I saw.
[19:52.350 --> 19:53.350]  Yeah.
[19:57.110 --> 19:58.270]  Interesting.
[19:58.470 --> 20:00.110]  Have you been to Bob Marley's house before?
[20:00.110 --> 20:00.990]  And what is that?
[20:00.990 --> 20:03.190]  Nine mile, eight mile, nine mile?
[20:03.190 --> 20:04.190]  Yeah. Yeah.
[20:04.710 --> 20:07.990]  The house, his house, his mausoleum and the other museum there in
[20:08.910 --> 20:10.550]  and Kingston as well.
[20:11.430 --> 20:15.310]  Nice. Yeah, I've been there a few times and
[20:18.470 --> 20:21.670]  they were like, if you want, you can smoke in his mausoleum.
[20:21.830 --> 20:25.470]  And I remember I did that a few times.
[20:26.630 --> 20:29.350]  Gosh, almost 20 years ago.
[20:29.510 --> 20:32.110]  But that was that was really special.
[20:33.910 --> 20:36.430]  How about Africa?
[20:36.470 --> 20:39.630]  What is was it like during in Zimbabwe?
[20:41.030 --> 20:45.670]  Zimbabwe was cool because I had a license and I could have weed on me and like.
[20:46.590 --> 20:51.710]  Most of the rest of the country that was was facing like eight to 12 years if they had it on them, so
[20:51.990 --> 20:54.550]  I could go through a checkpoint with like a grip of weed.
[20:54.910 --> 20:57.750]  And as long as I was the one who had it, there was no problems.
[20:57.750 --> 21:01.270]  It was really fun to go through a checkpoint and be like, here's my passport.
[21:01.750 --> 21:03.030]  Here's my weed permit.
[21:03.430 --> 21:04.830]  Here's my pound of weed.
[21:05.190 --> 21:09.390]  Get fucked like that was really cool.
[21:09.470 --> 21:14.710]  But also so in Zimbabwe, when I was there, first off, the government owns like a small
[21:14.710 --> 21:19.710]  portion of your your company or they have like a stockholding or, you know, they whatever
[21:19.710 --> 21:22.070]  they own, a part of the company just for any company there.
[21:22.430 --> 21:27.310]  And then we had to be within 10 kilometers or 20 kilometers of a military or police
[21:27.310 --> 21:32.950]  facility. So we were within 10 kilometers of an Air Force base.
[21:33.310 --> 21:38.070]  So and we had two of their soldiers that were stationed at our farm at all times.
[21:38.910 --> 21:42.710]  So we have like, you know, the best security ever.
[21:42.710 --> 21:47.190]  Like if someone seriously tried to rob the farm, we could call in tanks and an airstrike.
[21:47.230 --> 21:49.590]  Like it was pretty great.
[21:50.630 --> 21:56.390]  It became a bit of a problem, though, because like so we had like a warthog that was kind
[21:56.390 --> 21:57.470]  of getting into the field.
[21:57.470 --> 22:00.390]  And I was like, yo, like, can you go shoot that thing?
[22:00.390 --> 22:02.870]  Like, I'll cook it up for dinner and I'll cook you guys dinner.
[22:02.870 --> 22:06.830]  Like, just, you know, go shoot him and I'll cook this thing up.
[22:07.350 --> 22:12.990]  And the guy goes over and then like throws a hand grenade in the hole and blows the shit
[22:12.990 --> 22:16.830]  out of this thing. And it's like, dude, I can't cook that now.
[22:16.830 --> 22:19.230]  It's like full of shrapnel and dirt.
[22:19.270 --> 22:23.790]  Like I asked you to shoot it, not blow it up.
[22:23.950 --> 22:25.030]  Anyways, that was fun.
[22:26.270 --> 22:29.870]  But in terms of like growing, it was really, really great.
[22:29.870 --> 22:33.150]  We had almost all women in terms of workers.
[22:33.830 --> 22:37.230]  The women there, they actually the people that work the fields and know what's up with
[22:37.230 --> 22:41.830]  their agriculture, the dudes, you know, work in the markets or work in the shops or work
[22:41.830 --> 22:45.070]  in town or work in mining or have some other some other job.
[22:45.710 --> 22:49.630]  But the women are the ones that know, hey, this is the insects you need to worry about.
[22:49.630 --> 22:51.310]  This is the type of soil that you need.
[22:51.590 --> 22:54.150]  This is the good fertilizer for this or that or the other.
[22:54.790 --> 22:59.790]  Also started to do a lot of work with like working with termite mounds and some of the
[22:59.790 --> 23:03.710]  creative natural farming stuff around that and hadn't had access to large amounts of
[23:03.710 --> 23:05.710]  that before. That was interesting.
[23:05.710 --> 23:11.950]  And then also teaching them all about K&F and and how to like they're used to burning
[23:11.950 --> 23:14.710]  out all the grass and everything before planting.
[23:14.710 --> 23:16.950]  And we got them to like not do that.
[23:16.990 --> 23:21.710]  And we're like, look, you have those fungi underground that's holding water up by the
[23:21.710 --> 23:22.990]  surface. Wow.
[23:23.030 --> 23:24.350]  You don't want to burn that out.
[23:24.350 --> 23:27.630]  You want to keep that fungi there holding the water up by the surface.
[23:27.950 --> 23:29.710]  So let's just plant the cannabis.
[23:29.710 --> 23:32.910]  You know, we'll cut a little line in between, but we're going to leave the grass in
[23:32.910 --> 23:35.670]  between and we'll just cut it down lower later on.
[23:35.670 --> 23:40.150]  Or bring the animals through and cut it down once we harvest and then replace the crop
[23:40.390 --> 23:41.510]  to cut the grass back.
[23:41.510 --> 23:44.030]  And once we started doing that, man, we didn't have to.
[23:44.510 --> 23:48.030]  There was a noticeable difference in the amount of water between that and then the
[23:48.030 --> 23:49.670]  control field where we burned.
[23:50.790 --> 23:52.790]  And it was quite a bit of a difference.
[23:52.790 --> 23:55.150]  And then also just the plants did better.
[23:55.150 --> 23:56.190]  They had less problems.
[23:56.190 --> 23:58.270]  Plus, the bugs kind of had something else to eat.
[23:58.670 --> 24:00.590]  They weren't just solely focused on the cannabis.
[24:00.590 --> 24:02.590]  So the big takeaway.
[24:02.590 --> 24:06.110]  And then there's also just perfecting that IPMO, which really saved our ass with the
[24:06.110 --> 24:08.990]  grasshoppers was the other big takeaway out there.
[24:09.990 --> 24:14.630]  The other thing that came out of that was the idea for the Open Nutrient Project.
[24:14.630 --> 24:19.870]  Seeing nothing but Syngenta on all the fertilizer stores made me want to kind of do
[24:19.870 --> 24:23.950]  something about that. So I started working on trying to put all of those nutrient data
[24:23.950 --> 24:25.870]  for different crops and stuff into one place.
[24:26.190 --> 24:30.190]  It's a little more organized, easy access to which anyone can check out at
[24:30.190 --> 24:31.670]  OpenNutrientProject.com.
[24:31.670 --> 24:36.670]  And we have a really cool new version of that we're working on right now that'll be
[24:37.270 --> 24:40.990]  much easier to use and a little bit more in-depth and interactive.
[24:41.510 --> 24:43.310]  It's just going to take a little bit more time to finish.
[24:44.190 --> 24:49.590]  And so Open Nutrient Project is a website that you guys are putting together.
[24:49.590 --> 24:54.950]  That's a collection of information regarding how to create your own nutrients and feed
[24:54.950 --> 24:56.870]  them to specific plants.
[24:57.790 --> 25:00.750]  Yeah, so we actually have it's already live.
[25:00.750 --> 25:05.070]  So the first version of it, it's still adding a few new bells and whistles to it.
[25:05.110 --> 25:09.350]  But you can go on an OpenNutrientProject.com, select what nutrients it is that you need.
[25:10.030 --> 25:14.030]  And it's all sorted by Latin name, by average nutrient parts for millions.
[25:14.030 --> 25:20.390]  If you were to find what's high in potassium or what's high in this, that or the
[25:20.390 --> 25:21.790]  other in your...
[25:31.110 --> 25:33.750]  Sorry, it's a huge gecko just walked by.
[25:34.350 --> 25:35.590]  We have geckos in the house.
[25:37.270 --> 25:38.390]  Totally distracted me.
[25:40.510 --> 25:46.590]  So you can basically find, OK, well, this plant in my yard has high in potassium, this
[25:46.590 --> 25:49.230]  one's high in phosphorus, this one's high in whatever, whatever.
[25:49.550 --> 25:56.350]  And then from there, you can utilize that to balance out your compost or your ferments
[25:56.350 --> 26:01.150]  or your compost teas or whatever it is that you're wanting to create.
[26:01.150 --> 26:02.550]  So it's agnostic, right?
[26:02.590 --> 26:08.590]  I don't care if you're into KNF or JADAM or Soil Food Web or hydroponics.
[26:08.590 --> 26:11.310]  Like this gives you options to create whatever it is.
[26:11.950 --> 26:16.270]  I'm trying to give people the toolbox and they can decide how to utilize that within
[26:16.270 --> 26:20.390]  their, you know, to solve the problems that they need rather than trying to tell them
[26:20.390 --> 26:21.150]  how to fix it.
[26:22.390 --> 26:23.190]  That's awesome.
[26:23.190 --> 26:31.310]  I mean, for me, I felt like cannabis has been a gateway into gardening, other things,
[26:31.310 --> 26:35.270]  learning about my own fertilizers, learning, you know, learning about my inputs,
[26:36.950 --> 26:39.030]  learning how to make my own inputs.
[26:39.550 --> 26:44.510]  You know, like I don't make all of my inputs, but I like to make some of them.
[26:44.510 --> 26:50.030]  And I strongly feel that it's nice to know how to make something so that then you can
[26:50.030 --> 26:52.750]  make the choice on if you want to make it or if you want to buy it.
[26:53.070 --> 26:58.950]  And you kind of have an idea of what it truly takes to create that specific input.
[26:59.390 --> 27:06.070]  Kind of like a small little anecdote, like we purchased our house and, you know, I'm
[27:06.070 --> 27:10.910]  not the most handy person, but it's nice for me to kind of learn how to fix things in my
[27:10.910 --> 27:15.750]  house so that I know, OK, like, you know, sanding the wall, I can do that.
[27:16.030 --> 27:20.630]  Some other things are a bit past my pay grade, but it's good to like learn about it and
[27:20.630 --> 27:22.390]  know, you know what I mean?
[27:22.390 --> 27:23.910]  What goes into these things?
[27:23.910 --> 27:28.230]  Yeah, that's super interesting, I guess.
[27:28.230 --> 27:34.150]  Also, like what I've recently learned, I mean, it was just a quick YouTube video, was you
[27:34.150 --> 27:41.790]  can make your own bone meal by just cooking up bones and then smashing them up.
[27:41.790 --> 27:43.310]  And there you go. You have bone meal.
[27:44.990 --> 27:47.510]  I didn't realize it could be that simple.
[27:47.550 --> 27:55.550]  So, yeah, and for me, my I guess my passion is regarding earthworm castings.
[27:55.550 --> 27:58.150]  I really love compost and earthworm castings.
[27:58.150 --> 28:07.270]  And to me, that really seems like the magic ingredient that I find makes my stuff pop
[28:07.270 --> 28:12.790]  and really pulls out the terpenes, in which I feel like that's like the thing that I
[28:12.790 --> 28:17.710]  makes the difference between like good cannabis and great cannabis are, you know, the
[28:17.710 --> 28:23.550]  people who can pull out those those subtle flavors.
[28:26.030 --> 28:30.150]  So, yeah, I mean, I'm sure all your stuff has flavors because I know that, you know,
[28:30.150 --> 28:34.870]  stuff that's grown, you know, with K&F and GDOM, all that that type of cannabis, from
[28:34.870 --> 28:37.470]  my opinion, has the most terpenes.
[28:37.470 --> 28:43.070]  Absolutely, yeah. And we actually feed either IPMO or IMO, liquid IMO, one or the other,
[28:43.070 --> 28:44.150]  every other watering.
[28:44.150 --> 28:49.070]  So we do, you know, a light feeding, then the fungi and then regular water.
[28:49.110 --> 28:52.950]  Just do one, two, three on rotation for all of our watering.
[28:52.950 --> 28:57.150]  And it constantly gives those plants, you know, a new injection of different nutrients
[28:57.150 --> 28:58.150]  and different nutrients.
[28:58.150 --> 28:59.150]  And so we do that.
[28:59.150 --> 29:01.150]  And then we also do a lot of waterings.
[29:01.150 --> 29:02.150]  So we do a lot of waterings.
[29:03.150 --> 29:07.230]  For all of our watering and constantly gives those plants, you know, a new injection of
[29:07.230 --> 29:12.350]  different microbials that help keep those plants and systems stimulated, which increases
[29:12.350 --> 29:16.510]  your secondary metabolite production and then increases the terpenes.
[29:17.470 --> 29:18.550]  For sure.
[29:18.950 --> 29:20.630]  Also, I've noticed that.
[29:22.790 --> 29:23.950]  So, yeah, let's jump in.
[29:24.510 --> 29:29.790]  You were saying that in Africa they use Syngenta, which is synthetic, right?
[29:29.790 --> 29:35.350]  I mean, I don't know the name of it, but it sounds like some gnarly major agribusiness,
[29:35.990 --> 29:36.870]  which is that's correct.
[29:37.910 --> 29:41.470]  Yeah, they're basically up there with Monsanto or Scotts.
[29:42.350 --> 29:45.390]  They're kind of the other one that's slowly taking over the world.
[29:45.870 --> 29:49.950]  They're bigger than those two, than the other two.
[29:51.590 --> 29:58.870]  So, I mean, before Syngenta came into Zimbabwe, I'm sure they had their own native
[29:59.430 --> 30:01.550]  agricultural techniques that they are using.
[30:02.470 --> 30:04.310]  Well, before the British.
[30:04.310 --> 30:06.030]  Yeah. Before the British.
[30:06.030 --> 30:14.110]  So that so is so is a lot of those kind of traditions gone since it's been like, do they
[30:14.110 --> 30:18.350]  have do they still use those traditions or is it salt?
[30:19.110 --> 30:25.390]  Yes and no. So they do have some traditions and some methods, but a lot of it, a lot of
[30:26.390 --> 30:33.550]  that knowledge and the more knowledgeable people there were kind of not valued as much
[30:33.550 --> 30:38.150]  during the British and maybe is the polite way to put it.
[30:39.070 --> 30:45.670]  So they're not around really anymore to teach other people the way that maybe some of the
[30:45.670 --> 30:52.870]  other people also like a lot of the country there isn't like, yeah, they did agriculture,
[30:52.870 --> 30:58.270]  but they weren't. Not in the same kind of way that the West does with the larger scale
[30:58.270 --> 31:03.630]  stuff or even even Southeast Asia with the larger scale farming was much more small scale
[31:03.630 --> 31:08.430]  like, OK, growing enough for my household or my household, the next door's household,
[31:08.430 --> 31:15.310]  like much, much more hyper small scale in Africa than it is anywhere else that I've
[31:15.310 --> 31:20.550]  seen. So is it kind of like subsistence farming in a way like.
[31:21.070 --> 31:22.550]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:22.590 --> 31:23.590]  Just enough for them.
[31:23.630 --> 31:29.590]  Yeah. But you do have the one exception to that is the San people there, which are amazing
[31:29.590 --> 31:37.630]  at the Khoisan. If anyone ever gets a chance to learn about them, they're the original
[31:37.630 --> 31:43.670]  natives of that part of the world and they go back 60, 70 thousand years and they can
[31:44.230 --> 31:48.870]  go anywhere and just pick up anything and know exactly what's useful and what is it
[31:48.910 --> 31:50.870]  and all that stuff and learn a lot.
[31:50.910 --> 31:56.750]  We had one guy there that was one of his parents was that and he taught me a whole hell
[31:56.750 --> 32:00.790]  of a lot in terms of like, OK, this one's good for this and this one's good for this
[32:00.790 --> 32:03.790]  and blah, blah, blah with the different stuff that we had on the property.
[32:05.350 --> 32:06.470]  That's interesting.
[32:08.230 --> 32:13.670]  Would you say that like native indigenous cultures have.
[32:14.670 --> 32:19.670]  Similar types of agricultural techniques, just using different products, or does it
[32:19.670 --> 32:27.350]  seem like they have different techniques with the different geographic locations?
[32:29.110 --> 32:33.750]  I mean, in some ways it's similar to all of them kind of have a different way of adding
[32:33.750 --> 32:39.550]  fungi or microbial biodiversity, like some kind of equivalent to like leaf mold or IMO
[32:39.950 --> 32:40.830]  or some kind of.
[32:42.510 --> 32:48.670]  Or composted kind of inoculant, some some one of those three is definitely present in
[32:48.670 --> 32:50.430]  most of the stuff that I've been around.
[32:51.190 --> 32:56.430]  The other thing is, is that like lactobacillus ferments, like some kind of milk based
[32:56.430 --> 33:03.230]  fermentation seems to be pretty widely used, even from Jamaica to K&F to Southeast Asia
[33:03.230 --> 33:04.510]  here in Thailand.
[33:04.870 --> 33:09.030]  You know, they all have some kind of version of either rice wash, lactobacillus or milk
[33:09.030 --> 33:14.390]  based lactobacillus that they're utilizing either as a mold control or as a fertilizer
[33:14.390 --> 33:18.550]  or both. So that's something that seems to be pretty universal as well.
[33:19.070 --> 33:23.510]  And when it comes to kind of, you know, looking at it from a more macroscopic view.
[33:24.670 --> 33:25.670]  Interesting.
[33:26.310 --> 33:28.750]  What were the strains like in Zimbabwe?
[33:30.390 --> 33:32.310]  Zimbabwe had some pretty interesting stuff.
[33:32.350 --> 33:40.590]  We had everything from like really horrible, like very clearly like bushweed, like
[33:40.590 --> 33:46.630]  something that was like some ancient sativa that like didn't have a single crystal on
[33:46.630 --> 33:52.670]  it. That was more like a hemp or something like a fiber hemp or something all the way up
[33:52.670 --> 33:56.110]  to some really nice cerebral sativa.
[33:56.110 --> 34:01.590]  When I was up in Yanga, up on the eastern side of the island, if any or the country, if
[34:01.590 --> 34:08.030]  anyone ever goes out to Zimbabwe, take some time and go to some of the Rastafarian
[34:08.030 --> 34:11.390]  cafes and Harare and then you can meet some cool people.
[34:11.390 --> 34:15.510]  But if you go out and younger, there's a bunch of Rastas and stuff that live up in the
[34:15.510 --> 34:20.190]  border between Zimbabwe and Mozambique.
[34:20.550 --> 34:28.910]  And a lot of those guys grow some fire, including this really high alpha pinene, like
[34:29.230 --> 34:35.590]  just super, super ultra sativa, like cerebral high that I haven't felt in a long time.
[34:36.350 --> 34:39.950]  But what was interesting, too, there is like they brag about like whether or not there's
[34:39.950 --> 34:44.830]  snakes in their garden, because when they have really dank, resi weed, the snakes will
[34:44.830 --> 34:48.230]  come and like rub themselves on it to like get rid of the parasites on them.
[34:48.230 --> 34:53.550]  And like to that to them is like a blessing from the snakes or whatever.
[34:53.550 --> 34:58.030]  But it's like a way for them to like, you know, like brag that their weeds like ultra
[34:58.030 --> 35:02.990]  dank, which I thought was like half insane because of how many venomous snakes are
[35:02.990 --> 35:07.350]  there. And then also just like a really funny, interesting, local way of bragging about how
[35:07.350 --> 35:08.390]  good your weed is.
[35:08.870 --> 35:12.310]  Yeah. These are poisonous snakes, right?
[35:12.990 --> 35:18.070]  Well, they have green mambas and black mambas there and spitting cobras and like they have
[35:18.110 --> 35:19.510]  the full gamut of stuff there.
[35:19.510 --> 35:25.070]  So boom slangs and twig snakes and I could go on.
[35:25.790 --> 35:29.830]  I mean, I've grown in in what is that?
[35:30.230 --> 35:31.910]  Brand scum and like Mendo.
[35:32.350 --> 35:34.790]  And we had like rattlesnakes in the property.
[35:34.790 --> 35:37.590]  And that was not something we would brag about.
[35:37.590 --> 35:41.270]  I mean, we would try to kill those guys because, you know, they'd like be sunning, you
[35:41.270 --> 35:42.830]  know, like right next to a patch.
[35:42.830 --> 35:45.870]  You don't want to like, you know, spook one.
[35:48.190 --> 35:57.590]  So, OK, so in Zimbabwe, so I guess in Africa as well as in Asia, that's more of like
[35:58.070 --> 36:02.030]  Jamaica as well. That's more of a flower culture, right?
[36:02.030 --> 36:06.550]  I mean, that's not that's less so of a hash culture and more of like in the Middle East
[36:06.550 --> 36:09.710]  and India are hash cultures.
[36:10.110 --> 36:16.830]  So do you find that there is I mean, I'm sure there would be a difference in morphology
[36:16.830 --> 36:18.750]  and like the qualities of these different plants.
[36:18.750 --> 36:24.230]  But do you have you observed that like these plants that have been bred for a while for
[36:24.230 --> 36:26.510]  flower smoking as opposed to for hash?
[36:26.510 --> 36:29.790]  And is that correct that those are for flower smoking and not for hash?
[36:30.350 --> 36:35.230]  Yes and no. So in Jamaica, they definitely have hash culture, like what they call a gum.
[36:36.190 --> 36:41.430]  And they totally have it's very similar to like Nepal or stuff like that.
[36:41.670 --> 36:47.350]  The longer sativas they're making up for that longer flowering time by getting some some
[36:47.350 --> 36:49.750]  hash cultures off of it beforehand.
[36:49.750 --> 36:53.030]  So they get two or three harvests off that plant and then still sell the flower.
[36:54.190 --> 36:56.750]  You know, I've seen that happen quite a bit in Jamaica.
[36:57.510 --> 36:59.750]  So that was totally right out there.
[36:59.750 --> 37:05.710]  The rest of it now in Zimbabwe, you know, they didn't have any of that because weeds,
[37:06.030 --> 37:08.390]  you know, illegal for most of the population there.
[37:08.390 --> 37:16.030]  So you might I had some hash because we made it, but I didn't have anyone offer me hash
[37:16.030 --> 37:17.510]  the whole time I was in Zimbabwe.
[37:18.670 --> 37:22.950]  I could have bought it actually from this one guy, but, you know, that was a separate
[37:22.950 --> 37:30.430]  situation. But in Thailand, you know, hash isn't currently legal here right now in
[37:30.430 --> 37:35.950]  Thailand. So except for if you're getting it through a university or a hospital, you can
[37:35.950 --> 37:41.950]  get it. So but other than that, you know, you can't just produce it and sell it.
[37:42.110 --> 37:45.350]  The way we can flower, for instance, under our licensing right now.
[37:45.350 --> 37:48.990]  So but that's going to hopefully change here in the next few months.
[37:50.270 --> 37:51.990]  We'll kind of see what the government does.
[37:51.990 --> 37:56.950]  They have an election here in May, and that's going to really decide what the future of
[37:57.150 --> 37:59.070]  cannabis legalization here in Thailand.
[37:59.910 --> 38:01.470]  So let's let's let's talk about that.
[38:01.470 --> 38:03.630]  How is legalization in Thailand going?
[38:04.630 --> 38:07.510]  I mean, it's it's interesting.
[38:07.510 --> 38:14.390]  So we don't currently have any taxes, which is, I think, the only legal market right now
[38:14.390 --> 38:17.390]  that isn't taxed, which is quite interesting.
[38:17.390 --> 38:21.430]  And I think they didn't I think I don't think they thought that part through.
[38:21.430 --> 38:25.350]  I think that, you know, they should at least be getting five or 10 percent, at least a
[38:25.350 --> 38:27.430]  little bit back so that that keeps them happy.
[38:27.430 --> 38:29.830]  Right. Because you got to keep them happy and making money.
[38:29.830 --> 38:31.990]  Otherwise they get pretty cranky.
[38:32.830 --> 38:39.750]  So we only have to report what our total plant count is and how many pounds or kilos we
[38:39.750 --> 38:41.710]  have on hand for sale.
[38:42.070 --> 38:43.830]  We don't have to really report much else.
[38:46.510 --> 38:49.870]  We kind of have free reign to do pretty much anything we want to.
[38:51.030 --> 38:54.590]  Obviously, you need to register stuff if you're going to import it, although it's not
[38:54.590 --> 38:59.070]  hard to find and pretty much any seeds that you want within the country at this point.
[38:59.590 --> 39:03.030]  Other than that, I mean, there's a flood.
[39:03.030 --> 39:07.630]  It's kind of like Oklahoma in a way or way where you kind of have a flood of people that
[39:07.630 --> 39:09.990]  are like, hey, I can get a license for cheap, let's do it.
[39:10.470 --> 39:12.110]  And then everyone's growing.
[39:12.110 --> 39:16.350]  But like only a tiny percentage are actually growing quality that you'd actually want to
[39:16.350 --> 39:22.990]  smoke and everyone else is kind of just growing, get their hands on as far as seeds go.
[39:23.030 --> 39:27.790]  So it's kind of this weird clusterfuck of, you know.
[39:28.830 --> 39:35.350]  A bunch of really low quality crap and then really my tiny minority that's growing stuff
[39:35.350 --> 39:41.070]  that would be on par with Western standards, and it's going to be interesting to kind of
[39:41.070 --> 39:44.910]  see what happens. I think a lot of people are going to jump in or about to jump back
[39:44.910 --> 39:45.550]  out of the boat.
[39:46.270 --> 39:49.630]  Is there any indoor cultivation going on in Thailand?
[39:50.310 --> 39:54.310]  Definitely in Bangkok, but the power prices here are pretty expensive.
[39:54.310 --> 40:00.670]  I mean, it's not very economical to do it when I can grow in a greenhouse for a hell
[40:00.670 --> 40:03.070]  of a lot less and grow something that's just as frosty.
[40:03.070 --> 40:08.230]  So it's kind of hard to justify the prices.
[40:09.830 --> 40:11.830]  And that is one other thing that's kind of crazy.
[40:11.830 --> 40:18.030]  I mean, we're still getting like anywhere from 16 to to thirty four dollars a gram,
[40:18.030 --> 40:19.950]  depending on what city you're in.
[40:21.270 --> 40:23.750]  And there's no ounce break or anything like that.
[40:23.750 --> 40:25.110]  That's that's what it is.
[40:25.110 --> 40:29.230]  So you're seeing pretty outrageous prices here still.
[40:29.350 --> 40:31.790]  Now, again, I can still get a cheap bag of weed.
[40:31.790 --> 40:36.910]  Like I can go down to my local one here, not too far from my house, from the locals and
[40:36.910 --> 40:40.830]  get stuff for 200 baht, which would be.
[40:42.150 --> 40:45.590]  I don't know, seven bucks a gram, eight bucks a gram, something like that.
[40:45.590 --> 40:48.270]  I don't know what the current exchange rate is, so they're on those ends.
[40:48.590 --> 40:51.830]  So but that's that's, you know, the village prices.
[40:51.830 --> 40:56.350]  But you go into any of the tourist areas or into the cities, you're looking instantly
[40:56.350 --> 40:58.550]  at like, you know, 15 plus.
[41:00.110 --> 41:04.310]  OK, I mean, but that still seems like right around.
[41:04.310 --> 41:08.710]  I mean, it's kind of around where things are here in California.
[41:11.510 --> 41:14.110]  But I guess there's no price, there's no break.
[41:14.390 --> 41:17.070]  And there's no like track and trace or anything like that.
[41:17.070 --> 41:19.230]  You just like report however many plants you have.
[41:19.630 --> 41:24.510]  And like as far as who you can sell cannabis to, it's just like people can just sell
[41:24.510 --> 41:26.430]  cannabis. Basically, it's not illegal to sell.
[41:26.430 --> 41:28.350]  Is that how it is? Or are there like dispensers?
[41:29.110 --> 41:31.870]  You have to yeah, you have to be licensed to sell weed.
[41:32.590 --> 41:34.670]  You know, anyone can have 14 plants.
[41:35.550 --> 41:39.310]  If you have more than that, you have to have a license and then you have to apply.
[41:39.350 --> 41:42.030]  You have a cultivation license, then you have a retail license.
[41:42.030 --> 41:45.070]  Your retail license is what you need in order to sell.
[41:45.070 --> 41:52.830]  And you can't sell to pregnant people or to anyone under the age of 20.
[41:54.830 --> 41:57.550]  And is that the drinking age also in Thailand is 20?
[41:58.350 --> 41:58.870]  Yep.
[42:00.510 --> 42:02.710]  What are the genetics like?
[42:02.710 --> 42:04.510]  I'm really curious.
[42:04.510 --> 42:06.830]  Like what's the like not.
[42:07.390 --> 42:09.470]  Yeah. What are the things that you're excited about?
[42:09.470 --> 42:15.870]  Sure. So of this, as far as Thai stuff goes, I found some really interesting chocolate
[42:15.870 --> 42:19.550]  stuff and coffee stuff, although not a lot of that.
[42:19.550 --> 42:23.790]  We're not any really good luck with any of the chocolate stuff so far, but we have a
[42:23.790 --> 42:27.150]  new round of chocolate stuff we're going to be putting into flower here this next run
[42:27.950 --> 42:28.910]  starting next week.
[42:28.910 --> 42:31.390]  So hopefully we'll find some stuff.
[42:31.390 --> 42:35.550]  Now, all the chocolate stuff from the first round either ended up being Herme or ended
[42:35.630 --> 42:39.630]  up being not very chocolatey on the flower.
[42:39.630 --> 42:42.030]  Like the veg stuff smells like chocolate and then flower.
[42:42.030 --> 42:45.870]  It smells like something completely different, which I thought was pretty interesting.
[42:45.870 --> 42:48.270]  So we'll see if it smokes all right and tastes good.
[42:48.270 --> 42:54.350]  But I'm still not thinking it's going to be very good because traditionally the chocolates
[42:54.350 --> 43:01.550]  tasting turps tend to smell like a like DMT kind of smell like a plastic bag or like an
[43:01.550 --> 43:02.590]  electrical flask.
[43:02.670 --> 43:11.310]  Vert plastic bag or like an electrical fire, like a power strip that got too hot, you know,
[43:11.870 --> 43:13.550]  like that kind of weird smell to it.
[43:13.550 --> 43:19.150]  That's on the tongue seems to have that chocolate taste to it, at least to me.
[43:20.190 --> 43:27.150]  But the most unique one by far, a buddy of mine found, we call it temple Thai, but he
[43:27.150 --> 43:31.550]  found my buddy, Canada Seeds went up to a lot, which is like a temple here.
[43:32.190 --> 43:39.070]  And found these monks that had these huge, like 20 foot tall plus cannabis plants that
[43:39.070 --> 43:42.190]  just had like, all those, the size of like your bicep or your leg.
[43:42.910 --> 43:49.550]  And he managed to trade some feminized seeds for them and get a whole bunch of seeds from
[43:49.550 --> 43:55.390]  those monks and the vigor and the size of they're like the Redwood trees of a weed.
[43:55.390 --> 44:02.830]  Like they're at after six weeks of from germination that are pushing nine, 10 feet tall.
[44:03.790 --> 44:09.230]  And like stocks on them that are like, you know, three inches around, like I've never
[44:09.230 --> 44:11.390]  seen a cannabis plant grow like this.
[44:11.390 --> 44:12.110]  It's insane.
[44:13.230 --> 44:17.310]  So I'm really looking forward to playing more with those genetics and finding out and it
[44:17.310 --> 44:21.870]  smelled really, really awesome peach turps, peach and sand, a little bit of sandalwood
[44:21.870 --> 44:22.190]  to them.
[44:22.910 --> 44:25.070]  So I think they're like a Himalayan strain.
[44:25.070 --> 44:28.670]  I think that's part of the reason why they have that bigger is that they're used to
[44:28.670 --> 44:29.950]  having that shorter summer.
[44:29.950 --> 44:36.030]  So again, purely speculative on that, but I've never seen anything that quite grows
[44:36.030 --> 44:36.990]  like those things do.
[44:36.990 --> 44:41.070]  So we've been, you know, hunting that him and I both have been, you know, hunting those
[44:41.070 --> 44:45.950]  pretty hard to try and, you know, find some good breeding stock with, cause that's going
[44:45.950 --> 44:47.550]  to be one of our first breeding projects.
[44:47.550 --> 44:52.430]  We have a seven breeding rooms here at the facility where we can breed every, you know,
[44:52.430 --> 44:56.590]  whatever we decide to breed out that's going to make sense for production.
[44:56.590 --> 45:01.630]  So, and we're going to stabilize and preserve a lot of the old tie stuff that is worth keeping.
[45:02.430 --> 45:06.750]  And then also, you know, throw away the stuff that isn't, but we're trying to keep, you
[45:06.750 --> 45:11.950]  know, two or three of each of the different tie stuff that we can do to back cross for
[45:11.950 --> 45:16.350]  preservation, because with all these people bringing in all these genetics, if we don't
[45:16.350 --> 45:18.030]  do that, it's going to be lost forever.
[45:18.030 --> 45:24.590]  And I've already watched that happen in Jamaica and, you know, we can at least preserve that
[45:24.590 --> 45:25.790]  stuff if we're quick about it.
[45:26.670 --> 45:27.390]  For sure.
[45:27.390 --> 45:30.990]  I saw you also have like a clone room.
[45:30.990 --> 45:34.670]  Is it difficult to keep clones in that kind of environment?
[45:35.630 --> 45:36.270]  Absolutely.
[45:36.270 --> 45:36.510]  Yeah.
[45:36.510 --> 45:37.950]  We definitely had a learning curve.
[45:38.270 --> 45:48.110]  So, one thing is here, the humidity fluctuates pretty extremely, at least in the dry season.
[45:48.110 --> 45:55.630]  So, we have to put humidification in the rooms and in the beginning for the first week or
[45:55.630 --> 45:59.310]  first three to five days, we put domes on them and we pull them off.
[45:59.310 --> 46:00.830]  And that seems to help a lot with that.
[46:00.830 --> 46:06.590]  And then the other big learning curve here was, and I'm used to just throwing them in
[46:06.590 --> 46:11.470]  domes and letting them rip in the States, you know, week and a half later, they're good
[46:11.470 --> 46:11.870]  to go.
[46:11.870 --> 46:13.950]  But here we couldn't do that.
[46:13.950 --> 46:16.590]  Where the other big thing was transplanting.
[46:16.590 --> 46:24.110]  So, instead of transplanting them directly from like rockwool or starch plug directly
[46:24.110 --> 46:27.390]  into the soil, we're transplanting them into a smaller root pouch.
[46:28.270 --> 46:33.230]  That's like, I don't know, the size of like a Dixie cup or whatever.
[46:33.230 --> 46:38.750]  And then letting them significantly gain a larger amount of root mass for an extra week
[46:38.750 --> 46:39.790]  before we put them out.
[46:40.510 --> 46:43.470]  And because without that root mass, they don't have a big enough root system.
[46:43.470 --> 46:48.430]  And when they go out into the sun, even with a 50% shade cloth, they're just getting cooked.
[46:48.430 --> 46:54.910]  Like the first route we put out there, I think we salvaged about 70% of them, but 30% of
[46:54.910 --> 46:55.950]  them was fried.
[46:56.910 --> 46:59.950]  And then we're like, okay, we gotta do something a little different.
[46:59.950 --> 47:04.590]  So, we ended up giving that extra time, but giving them an extra five to seven days.
[47:04.590 --> 47:08.750]  One, the bigger difference, they hit the ground running when you put them in the greenhouse
[47:08.750 --> 47:10.990]  and just roar most of the time.
[47:10.990 --> 47:14.830]  And then the other thing that helps a lot with is that they just have a big enough root
[47:14.830 --> 47:16.270]  system to kind of to take that.
[47:16.270 --> 47:19.870]  Now, it's been 107 degrees here the last week or so.
[47:19.870 --> 47:21.150]  So, it's been a bit brutal.
[47:22.110 --> 47:24.270]  Even giving them some bigger root mass.
[47:24.270 --> 47:28.910]  I mean, the plants all shut down by 10 o'clock and then, you know, they all are drooping
[47:28.910 --> 47:32.430]  a little bit by 10 o'clock, because even with the shade cloth, it's just so freaking
[47:32.430 --> 47:32.750]  hot.
[47:32.750 --> 47:38.510]  Even with the fans and everything, it's just hot.
[47:38.510 --> 47:41.070]  You know, so they shut down for that midday sun, you know.
[47:41.070 --> 47:42.590]  Interesting.
[47:43.710 --> 47:45.790]  That's something else I've seen with a lot of land race.
[47:45.790 --> 47:50.990]  You know, the bigger sativas, they'll shut down from like 10, 11 o'clock in the day until
[47:50.990 --> 47:54.110]  about two or three, and then they'll start to turn back on.
[47:54.110 --> 47:55.390]  I've noticed that quite a bit.
[47:56.910 --> 47:58.110]  That's super interesting.
[47:59.470 --> 48:04.830]  Do you notice any growth differences with your seeds versus clones?
[48:07.150 --> 48:09.870]  Not really.
[48:11.390 --> 48:13.870]  I don't, you know, I want to kind of stabilize everything.
[48:13.870 --> 48:17.230]  Also, with seeds, you know, you never know if you're going to end up with viruses like
[48:17.230 --> 48:20.030]  mosaic virus or something else that you're looking for.
[48:20.030 --> 48:25.230]  So, you know, that's one thing that we've kind of purged out now that we've had most
[48:25.230 --> 48:25.790]  of our stuff.
[48:25.790 --> 48:28.670]  Not all, but the majority of our stuff has been here for a couple months.
[48:29.630 --> 48:33.470]  A lot of it's already been flowered out or is in some stage of flower right now.
[48:34.430 --> 48:38.430]  You know, we can kind of see what's going on with all the different cultivars.
[48:39.150 --> 48:39.710]  That's good.
[48:40.510 --> 48:42.510]  Do you guys have to worry about hoplite virus?
[48:42.510 --> 48:45.150]  Has that made its way to Tire Land that much?
[48:45.870 --> 48:47.630]  I mean, we're definitely concerned about it.
[48:47.630 --> 48:51.950]  We actually use bleach in all of our containers for all of our workers.
[48:52.750 --> 48:59.070]  If you guys check out any of the videos that we've done, we have the bleach in the water
[48:59.070 --> 49:00.670]  with all of the scissors and all that.
[49:00.670 --> 49:03.550]  And then, you know, they have three sets of scissors for each one.
[49:03.550 --> 49:06.510]  They, you know, one, two, three, one, two, three with the scissors.
[49:06.510 --> 49:09.950]  And, you know, by the time that you've gone back to that same pair of scissors, you've
[49:09.950 --> 49:13.390]  been working on two other plants, you know, that whole time.
[49:13.390 --> 49:18.750]  So it gives, you know, five or 10 minutes in between each one, depending on what you're
[49:18.750 --> 49:19.070]  doing.
[49:19.390 --> 49:22.910]  We're doing clones now in, you know, 3009 or so.
[49:23.790 --> 49:27.790]  And it's too hot to do them during the day because, you know, the plants are just, again,
[49:27.790 --> 49:30.110]  all will, you know, turned off in the middle of the day.
[49:30.110 --> 49:30.910]  You can't do that.
[49:30.910 --> 49:36.590]  So we generally start cloning around six o'clock at night and then kind of go into the evening
[49:36.590 --> 49:36.910]  that way.
[49:38.430 --> 49:40.590]  Man, that sounds like a tough night.
[49:44.190 --> 49:45.230]  It's not too bad.
[49:45.230 --> 49:49.950]  I mean, I'd rather do that than the heat, but I mean, you literally can't do it during
[49:49.950 --> 49:50.750]  the sun here.
[49:50.750 --> 49:53.870]  The clones, half the trail will be dead by the time you try to do it.
[49:53.870 --> 49:55.070]  It just doesn't work.
[49:55.070 --> 49:55.570]  Right.
[49:56.990 --> 50:01.310]  And do you guys end up doing a fair amount of work during the evening time?
[50:01.310 --> 50:05.470]  Like basically in the morning, in the evening, because it gets so hot during the daytime?
[50:06.670 --> 50:11.470]  Yeah, what we do is we work in the morning and then we'll work until about lunchtime.
[50:11.470 --> 50:16.270]  And then after lunch, I generally have them working in the indoor space, the nurseries,
[50:16.270 --> 50:21.950]  or we have some indoor breeding rooms or, you know, making soil in the shade.
[50:21.950 --> 50:27.310]  Or we can generally find something that's not in the direct sun most of the time for
[50:27.310 --> 50:30.190]  the afternoons, at least when it's this hot, you know.
[50:31.230 --> 50:33.470]  But also they're way more used to it than I am.
[50:33.470 --> 50:36.110]  Like I'm used to the heat, but this is next level.
[50:37.710 --> 50:39.390]  Yeah, for sure.
[50:39.390 --> 50:44.590]  I mean, God, I can remember like working under plants, you know, like in the shade.
[50:44.590 --> 50:48.430]  But yeah, at a certain time, it's like if the plants aren't growing, I felt like if
[50:48.430 --> 50:51.470]  the plants aren't able to grow, then you probably shouldn't be outside.
[50:54.430 --> 50:55.950]  But man, that's intense.
[50:56.510 --> 51:03.710]  Are there, I mean, so as a land race enthusiast, like my mind goes to like, oh, you know, what
[51:03.710 --> 51:08.190]  genetics from where can we, you know, can go to Thailand and they'll be even better?
[51:08.510 --> 51:15.630]  Is there any of that stuff from like any kind of hazes that are, you know, like Neville's
[51:15.630 --> 51:19.950]  haze type stuff or cough type stuff that's in Thailand crushing?
[51:19.950 --> 51:23.150]  Or like what's the take on that one?
[51:23.950 --> 51:26.190]  I have some Neville haze crosses actually.
[51:26.190 --> 51:30.670]  I have an A5 and I have, I forget what the other one is.
[51:30.670 --> 51:37.070]  But the northern Thai stuff, I would say if you're strictly bumbling around for seeds,
[51:38.430 --> 51:41.870]  the stuff from up north and Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, probably gonna have better luck
[51:42.510 --> 51:45.150]  finding some interesting stuff up there than anywhere else.
[51:45.150 --> 51:50.830]  Everywhere else is gonna be, you'll find some good stuff, but it's gonna be very like samey.
[51:50.830 --> 51:55.070]  Whereas up there, you're gonna find a little bit more diversity, I guess, at least from
[51:55.070 --> 51:55.710]  what I've seen.
[51:56.590 --> 51:57.150]  For sure.
[51:57.150 --> 52:09.310]  And like, are people growing like stuff from the United States there?
[52:09.310 --> 52:16.030]  Like, you know, like, no, it's pretty much Thai outcrosses mostly.
[52:16.750 --> 52:22.350]  Yeah, because especially if you go up like northwest from Chiang Mai, like trying to
[52:22.350 --> 52:26.750]  get up to where you have the hill tribes and stuff, those guys are like, not sharing with
[52:26.750 --> 52:30.030]  nobody, like except for a couple people here and there.
[52:30.030 --> 52:36.510]  So they're very much like autonomous almost, except for the current political situation
[52:36.510 --> 52:37.470]  in the country next door.
[52:37.470 --> 52:42.350]  So, you know, that's where you're gonna find stuff that hasn't been contaminated.
[52:42.350 --> 52:47.950]  That's got some uniqueness to it, I guess is kind of why I was recommending it is that
[52:47.950 --> 52:51.550]  stuff is not been contaminated anywhere near as much.
[52:51.550 --> 52:55.710]  You know, anywhere near Bangkok, Pattaya, Phuket, yeah, forget it.
[52:55.710 --> 52:58.590]  All that stuff is people from everywhere.
[52:58.590 --> 53:02.590]  But the farther you get from civilization is where you're gonna find the more interesting
[53:02.590 --> 53:02.830]  stuff.
[53:05.070 --> 53:07.790]  Would you say I grew some Burmese a few years ago?
[53:07.790 --> 53:08.670]  Was that last year?
[53:09.230 --> 53:13.870]  And I mean, obviously, in my environment, it didn't show nearly, you know, its potential.
[53:13.870 --> 53:18.190]  But is there things similar to like a Burmese that are grown out there?
[53:19.150 --> 53:21.390]  Which is similar to a Thai?
[53:22.350 --> 53:24.190]  I haven't had any Burmese stuff.
[53:24.190 --> 53:27.550]  We have some Lao stuff and Vietnamese and Cambodian stuff.
[53:28.270 --> 53:39.550]  But there isn't a lot of easy trade between Burma or what is now Myanmar.
[53:41.550 --> 53:45.470]  Because of the war right now, there's a, for those of you that don't know, there's a pretty
[53:46.430 --> 53:49.230]  pretty gnarly civil war going on right next door to Thailand.
[53:49.870 --> 53:55.550]  Thailand is a safe place, but they don't really allow much of anything to come across the border.
[53:55.550 --> 54:01.550]  And then you also have a lot of both sides of the war, the government and the rebels
[54:02.110 --> 54:10.190]  are funding, you know, meth production, basically to sell to fund to buy more guns.
[54:10.190 --> 54:14.990]  So they're very much looking for anything coming across that border right now.
[54:15.870 --> 54:21.790]  Because of that, and it's a very big like, no, like meth is a very big no-no here in Thailand.
[54:21.790 --> 54:24.030]  And it causes a lot of problems.
[54:24.590 --> 54:27.870]  And, you know, I don't like meth heads either.
[54:27.870 --> 54:29.070]  So I don't have a problem with that.
[54:29.070 --> 54:36.190]  But, you know, it's something that, you know, compared to Cambodia or Laos, where I can just
[54:36.190 --> 54:39.790]  throw them in the back of a pickup truck and drive across the border, and it's not a problem.
[54:40.750 --> 54:44.030]  You know, whereas Myanmar, you know, you're going to get, you know, they're going to search
[54:44.030 --> 54:47.870]  every inch of the vehicle and there's just, you don't have the same kind of trade coming
[54:47.870 --> 54:50.990]  across that border that you do on the other side of the country.
[54:50.990 --> 54:52.350]  Interesting.
[54:53.150 --> 54:53.870]  Because of that.
[54:55.790 --> 54:56.830]  That's very interesting.
[55:00.110 --> 55:02.190]  What is Thai cannabis culture like?
[55:04.590 --> 55:08.990]  Okay, so like people, so you're much more like a village style.
[55:08.990 --> 55:12.830]  So like, anytime we hang out with the local Thai homies, we have some friends of ours
[55:12.830 --> 55:17.790]  that have a crouton and cannabis farm right around the corner from us, like 10, 15 minutes
[55:17.790 --> 55:18.670]  away.
[55:18.670 --> 55:22.190]  And we hang out with those guys in the village, the people in the village there.
[55:22.190 --> 55:25.070]  And then sometimes we'll hang out with the villagers here in the town where I live.
[55:25.870 --> 55:30.510]  And it's mostly like hanging out, sit around a table, smoke weed, you know, drink, drink
[55:30.510 --> 55:32.750]  a couple beers or whatever, play some music.
[55:33.310 --> 55:35.710]  Maybe, you know, it's very similar to the States.
[55:35.710 --> 55:41.070]  Like it isn't that much different in terms of like events.
[55:41.070 --> 55:42.190]  You have a lot of lounges.
[55:43.790 --> 55:45.310]  They're kind of quasi legal.
[55:45.310 --> 55:48.990]  They didn't want them legal, but then they kind of were kind of semi legal again.
[55:50.110 --> 55:52.190]  A lot of bars are really cool with it.
[55:52.190 --> 55:56.830]  As long as you aren't smoking inside the building, you can kind of sit on the porch and smoke
[55:56.830 --> 55:57.150]  weed.
[55:57.150 --> 56:00.270]  So that's like most of the time people don't harass you.
[56:00.270 --> 56:03.950]  Like I was at a big festival, like a big temple show.
[56:03.950 --> 56:08.510]  They have like a big stage show with like 150 people in costumes.
[56:08.510 --> 56:09.790]  It looks like carnival.
[56:09.790 --> 56:10.910]  It's pretty wild.
[56:11.310 --> 56:16.110]  I went and smoked a bowl and like this head police captain or cop dude comes over and
[56:16.110 --> 56:17.390]  just asked to smoke weed with me.
[56:17.390 --> 56:21.310]  So I just smoked a bowl with him and we watched this thing together and he walked away and
[56:21.310 --> 56:25.070]  I thought for sure I was about to get a ticket and he was like, I just want to smoke some
[56:25.070 --> 56:25.390]  weed.
[56:26.670 --> 56:33.710]  So you don't say no to them, you know, but that's been really the only kind of thing
[56:34.270 --> 56:34.990]  that we've had here.
[56:35.950 --> 56:39.870]  I haven't really had too much negatives or anything like that when it comes to that.
[56:41.790 --> 56:43.070]  I don't know.
[56:43.070 --> 56:49.310]  We had lots of little events, you know, lots of like two to 400 person cannabis events
[56:49.310 --> 56:54.190]  with little booths and stuff with local businesses, almost like little farmer's market style.
[56:54.190 --> 56:56.270]  Maybe that's kind of a better way to put it.
[56:56.270 --> 57:00.510]  So that's a really kind of cool thing because of all the food markets and stuff.
[57:00.510 --> 57:01.950]  They kind of just applied it to weed.
[57:02.750 --> 57:07.630]  You also see cannabis like whenever you see like a plant market where you have like lots
[57:07.630 --> 57:11.630]  of different fruit trees and stuff, you'll see someone has a bunch of weed plants and
[57:11.630 --> 57:18.670]  they'll say like Kongalong or KD or any of the other more famous Thai strains that people
[57:18.670 --> 57:20.030]  are trying to find right now here.
[57:20.750 --> 57:21.950]  Usually it's not what it is.
[57:21.950 --> 57:23.630]  It's just whatever the local shit is.
[57:23.630 --> 57:26.670]  But once in a while you get lucky and it's something decent.
[57:28.830 --> 57:31.150]  And then in the cities, it's pretty wild.
[57:31.870 --> 57:40.110]  You go out in Bangkok or Pattaya or Phuket or any of the other bigger cities and you'll
[57:40.110 --> 57:43.870]  see people that just have like a table set up with like a bunch of jars and it's just
[57:43.870 --> 57:48.110]  the shit they grew and they have a license to sell but it's not their shop location isn't
[57:48.110 --> 57:50.910]  there because they have a license and they can kind of get away with it.
[57:51.870 --> 57:55.390]  And that's kind of interesting too where you kind of have that again, that kind of
[57:55.390 --> 57:59.710]  farmer's market kind of style to it where they're just setting up a table and selling
[57:59.710 --> 58:01.390]  their stuff and that's perfectly cool.
[58:01.390 --> 58:04.590]  Like if only it were that easy in the States, you know.
[58:04.590 --> 58:05.950]  I love that.
[58:05.950 --> 58:08.670]  It's like street food and so I just wanted to go in.
[58:08.670 --> 58:10.030]  How is the food there?
[58:10.030 --> 58:11.070]  I love Thai food.
[58:12.590 --> 58:15.070]  Yeah, the food here is the best part of Thailand.
[58:15.790 --> 58:17.070]  It's not even just Thai food.
[58:17.070 --> 58:20.750]  Like they have so many different kinds of food and there's always something that's
[58:20.750 --> 58:23.630]  in season now that wasn't last week.
[58:23.630 --> 58:24.350]  It's really cool.
[58:25.310 --> 58:30.830]  Like I have an amazing market that's like a mile from my house that's twice a week
[58:30.830 --> 58:35.150]  and then there's the night market that's at 1am which is the next town over and like
[58:35.150 --> 58:36.350]  there's always someplace cool.
[58:36.350 --> 58:42.830]  You can also like we kind of have a way better version of like Uber Eats because like they'll
[58:42.830 --> 58:47.710]  go to any of the street vendors or whatever else around too so you can get them to stop
[58:47.710 --> 58:51.950]  at like eight different places and get the craziest lunches order at like three o'clock
[58:51.950 --> 58:55.950]  in the morning and have them deliver it for like two dollars.
[58:55.950 --> 58:57.150]  It's fucking amazing.
[58:57.790 --> 59:00.110]  Like that's awesome.
[59:00.110 --> 59:03.870]  Now the food there is mad spicy, right?
[59:05.230 --> 59:08.270]  Or it depends all over it all over.
[59:08.270 --> 59:13.870]  Not everything is spicy but lots of fish, lots of pork, lots of chicken, very little
[59:13.870 --> 59:15.550]  beef, like very little beef.
[59:15.550 --> 59:16.910]  It's hard to find good beef.
[59:17.870 --> 59:28.110]  But so many different types of fruit and just none of the food is fatty or like yeah, but
[59:28.110 --> 59:29.390]  lots of sugar and everything.
[59:29.390 --> 59:35.790]  So like the mayonnaise has sugar and like everything has just more sugar than it needs
[59:35.790 --> 59:36.270]  to have.
[59:37.070 --> 59:40.510]  Even their own version of Coca-Cola is like entirely too sweet.
[59:41.390 --> 59:42.190]  Interesting.
[59:42.190 --> 59:45.870]  What is your favorite food to eat there?
[59:48.030 --> 59:50.510]  As far as fruit, it's going to be the same as Jamaica.
[59:50.510 --> 59:55.390]  In Jamaica, it's sweet stuff but here in Thailand, they call it Noina.
[59:56.190 --> 01:00:02.350]  But as far as Thai food, they make these really amazing garlic.
[01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:09.870]  It's like garlic oil fried pork ribs that are it just tastes so good.
[01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:14.990]  It's like basil and garlic and oil and pork ribs.
[01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:16.590]  It's so good.
[01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:23.870]  I'm trying to think of what else I've had that was like incredible, really amazing sushi
[01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:28.350]  places here too that are like all you can eat for like 9, 10 bucks.
[01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:30.270]  You know, that never gets old.
[01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:32.270]  Oh, that sounds nice.
[01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:34.350]  And the fish is fresh, right?
[01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:35.150]  I mean.
[01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:37.070]  Oh yeah, everything here is super fresh.
[01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:39.390]  That's awesome.
[01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:45.950]  And I mean, I'm assuming what papaya salad is dank out there.
[01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:49.230]  Oh yeah, we have two papaya trees in my yard.
[01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.950]  Awesome.
[01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:53.470]  That's awesome.
[01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:57.390]  So let's go into.
[01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:01.550]  So I want to talk, I guess a little bit more about the genetics in Thailand.
[01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:08.510]  So it sounds like what you're saying is that most of the genetics are you were saying semi-Thai.
[01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:10.670]  Like it's just it's not nothing special.
[01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:13.150]  There are a few things that are nice.
[01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:18.110]  Most of the stuff that imported is not so nice.
[01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:23.070]  No, I mean, the imported stuff has been all right.
[01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:28.670]  Like we have some really, really nice stuff that's definitely, you know, more Western than
[01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:35.870]  Thai that we're working with a lot of Larry Chimes crosses, so crosses some puck and some
[01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:37.230]  red that these puck.
[01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:42.510]  Other some really fire stuff that we're working on out here.
[01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:43.710]  That's much more heat tolerant.
[01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:46.270]  Again, trying to keep in mind sativas, narrow leaves.
[01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:50.190]  You know, you can't come in here and be growing Afghan and Paki stuff.
[01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.550]  Maybe some of the Marie stuff that's more narrow leaf, like
[01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:57.790]  that kind of stuff, but none of that wider leaf.
[01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:02.670]  And, you know, none of that Kush stuff is really going to do well here.
[01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:03.870]  It's just going to fry.
[01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:07.710]  Like those leaf structures cannot handle the sun here.
[01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:12.670]  They just, you know, but at the same time, things like a freak show actually do really
[01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:14.030]  well because of that.
[01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:17.790]  You can put them out in full sun here and they don't care because there's not enough
[01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:20.350]  leaf structure to get enough heat for them to care about it.
[01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:22.430]  Interesting.
[01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:24.990]  I did not think of that.
[01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:32.350]  And do would you do those types of genetics during the drier season?
[01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:37.390]  The more Western hybrids or just the stuff that's imported, not tie?
[01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:41.710]  Is that more during the dry season and then more tie stuff during the wet season or not
[01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:42.270]  necessarily?
[01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:48.910]  Well, I mean, in theory, yeah, but there's also a lot of Western stuff that really is
[01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:51.470]  pretty humid, humidity tolerant.
[01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:56.670]  But in general, yeah, you'd want to stick to more local local cross stuff to deal with
[01:02:56.670 --> 01:03:00.350]  the humidity and the bugs that come along with the wet season, because you have much
[01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:04.270]  fewer bugs during the dry season as well because you don't have all this extra food
[01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:06.270]  sources for them to feed on, to breed on.
[01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:08.830]  Interesting.
[01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:16.270]  Do you I mean, I assume you probably get some OG and some gas stuff.
[01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:18.430]  I mean, are you able to get any of that?
[01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:19.150]  Do you miss it?
[01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:20.430]  Oh, yeah.
[01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:22.430]  Well, I definitely have quite a bit.
[01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:29.230]  I actually have some cherry OG freak show crosses, which is really, really, really
[01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.790]  nice.
[01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:32.990]  Actually, I miss this one.
[01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.550]  Thanks.
[01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:37.710]  And what else do we have?
[01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:39.390]  A couple OGs, but not many.
[01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:44.430]  Again, really just kind of purged everything that's wide leaf out of there.
[01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:46.110]  And that really kind of did it itself.
[01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:52.750]  The only two that we had that were really widely for black garlic and the blueberry
[01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:58.910]  and the although we did find the blueberry OG seems to do OK, but the blueberry itself
[01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:06.510]  and the black garlic and what was the other one, the big sweet and the white widow Jada,
[01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:09.470]  all of those were much more wider leaf cultivars.
[01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:16.670]  All of those had a heat stressing that was causing them to flower early for outside of
[01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:18.270]  the normal vegetable cycle.
[01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:21.950]  They were starting to flower just from the heat or root bound or whatever.
[01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:23.310]  They just did not like it.
[01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:26.430]  So they're one and done.
[01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:28.590]  Kick all those moms in the flower farm out.
[01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.710]  OK, cool.
[01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:33.950]  That'll be pre-roll flower or local discount weed flower or whatever.
[01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:34.750]  Nothing wrong with it.
[01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:37.150]  It's just OK, it flowered.
[01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:38.830]  It had a schedule that we wanted to put it on.
[01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:40.510]  So we're not going to clone that and use it.
[01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:41.970]  Right.
[01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:43.630]  Right.
[01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:48.350]  And I mean, I would assume are you seeing that your clones are flowering a little bit
[01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:55.310]  earlier than your seeds or are they still able to hold their veg as long as you'd like?
[01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:59.630]  I'm not going to bench them as long as I want to just keep the lights on.
[01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:00.130]  OK.
[01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:01.550]  Yeah, we're running.
[01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:04.190]  We have lights in all our greenhouses that we can run.
[01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:08.990]  Now, our current light cycle is we run them in an hour at nine o'clock or 45 minutes,
[01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:12.670]  rather, at nine o'clock, 45 minutes at midnight and 45 minutes at 3 a.m.
[01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:16.670]  And that just breaks the night time up for them to have it.
[01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:22.430]  And then we only really have to run about an hour and a half total, you know, whatever,
[01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:24.030]  three, 45, 45, 45.
[01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:27.470]  This way, we don't have to run that as much power.
[01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:29.870]  We kind of cut down on our rent costs as well.
[01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:30.910]  For sure.
[01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:33.870]  I've also heard that there can be like rolling blackouts.
[01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:41.390]  So it would seem like it would make sense to run it when there's less load on the grid.
[01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:44.590]  Yeah, we don't really have any power problems here.
[01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:49.070]  If we get like a cycle, we can have power problems.
[01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.070]  But we haven't had any.
[01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:55.790]  It'll go out maybe for an hour or two if they're like maintenance or something.
[01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:59.070]  But we haven't had it go out more than about an hour and a half,
[01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:00.910]  except for when they were doing installation.
[01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:02.590]  That's good.
[01:06:02.590 --> 01:06:06.990]  I mean, would your I mean, it seems like your plants would if you don't have fans,
[01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:08.670]  do you have to have fans running in your greenhouse?
[01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:15.710]  I mean, we have fans running in all the greenhouses 24 hours a day, but
[01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:19.790]  it would survive.
[01:06:19.790 --> 01:06:23.070]  It'd get a little bit warmer in there, but there's screen greenhouses, right?
[01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:24.990]  So that the walls can breathe.
[01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:29.950]  So, you know, it might be a little bit warmer in there, but it's not going to be that much warmer.
[01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:30.190]  Okay.
[01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.910]  Awesome.
[01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:36.530]  What?
[01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:41.790]  So you guys produce flour that's for the local market.
[01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:42.910]  I mean, is that correct?
[01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:45.870]  Is there going to start being exporting in Thailand?
[01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:53.070]  So we have an import export license as well, but we have not utilized that at this point.
[01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:53.630]  Right now.
[01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:58.350]  I don't even know if you could, you might be able to try and do it,
[01:06:58.350 --> 01:07:02.110]  but I don't know if the rest of the infrastructure is in on the government side to like,
[01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:04.590]  functionally make that happen.
[01:07:05.790 --> 01:07:09.470]  I was the first person to legally import seeds into Zimbabwe, which is really cool.
[01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:11.870]  I have a whole funny story about that.
[01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:16.030]  So we had our, we imported the seeds and we had all the paperwork and everything
[01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:18.110]  and the stamp from the government and all.
[01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:22.510]  So we got to pick them up at the airport and I'm like, yeah, here, I'm here to pick up my box.
[01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:23.870]  And they're like, well, what's in the box?
[01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:25.390]  And I was like, it's a bunch of cannabis seeds.
[01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:28.110]  And they're like, that's cool.
[01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:29.070]  You're under arrest.
[01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:30.910]  And I'm like, no, no, no.
[01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:31.950]  Here's my paperwork.
[01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:36.110]  Let's not jump to conclusions here, boys.
[01:07:36.830 --> 01:07:41.790]  So, so I show them all my paperwork and they're like, okay, this is cool.
[01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:45.150]  We're going to go get the supervisor or whatever.
[01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:48.190]  So he comes down and he checks it out and he's like, all right.
[01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:50.910]  And he makes a phone call or whatever.
[01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:51.950]  And he's like, okay, cool.
[01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:52.910]  He's good.
[01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:56.990]  So then they, they open the box up because they like, think I'm fucking with it or whatever.
[01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.670]  So then they're, and it smells right.
[01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:04.030]  Cause this stuff is like, it had just been signed off on the COAs and all the phytosanitary
[01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:05.790]  is all the other happy horseshit we had to have.
[01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:10.830]  And there's like, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands of seeds,
[01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:13.790]  but it has like that hint of like weed res, you know, not strong,
[01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:15.310]  but like enough to tell us weed.
[01:08:15.310 --> 01:08:16.030]  Right.
[01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:19.790]  So they, they're like, oh, let's, let's test the dog.
[01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:25.150]  So they put the box out with a bunch of other boxes and they bring the dogs out and they're
[01:08:25.150 --> 01:08:28.670]  like, how I'm going through and the dogs don't hit on the box.
[01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:32.750]  And they suddenly went from kind of being happy, cheery, like let's fuck with the hippie
[01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:36.590]  to like, we got ripped off with these dogs who were really pissed off.
[01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:39.310]  And it was like, can I get these seeds now and go?
[01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:42.830]  Like, I don't want to get, I don't want you guys to be mad at me.
[01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:44.750]  I didn't, I didn't sell you the dogs.
[01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:46.110]  Can I just get my seeds and go?
[01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:49.870]  Like, and it does immediately try to like get them and get the hell out of there.
[01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:55.790]  So that was a really interesting afternoon, but that was a lot of fun.
[01:08:56.670 --> 01:09:01.870]  I mean, I gotta say it definitely takes a large set of balls to do cannabis business
[01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:14.110]  in other countries that you seem like you have a very unique temperament to be able to
[01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:23.630]  pull off, interact, you know, the cannabis politics and the politics of, you know, being
[01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:26.430]  a foreigner, you know, being in a different country.
[01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:27.630]  I mean, that sounds like a lot.
[01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:32.270]  I mean, I guess I never thought of it in that prospect, but like, I don't know, to me, it's
[01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:33.230]  an adventure, right?
[01:09:33.230 --> 01:09:38.670]  Like I have this incredible life where I've worked hard to learn all this different stuff
[01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:42.510]  about cannabis and, you know, grow on all these different cool places.
[01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:47.150]  I've had a chance to see the world and travel the world, you know, growing cannabis.
[01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:51.070]  If you told me when I was 16 years old, that I was going to grow up and travel the world
[01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:54.030]  growing weeds, I would have been like, you're crazy.
[01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:57.070]  Like whatever drugs you're on, like I need some of those.
[01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:59.150]  I would never have believed it.
[01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:03.070]  And it's kind of like, kind of like forced the reality that I wanted to live in.
[01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:10.270]  And I don't know, it just, if you, if you work hard and you just spend a lot of time
[01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:13.870]  reading, like that's the biggest thing, like spend an hour or two every night reading,
[01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:18.910]  learning new stuff, like always learning my papers, talking to people like Matt Powers,
[01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:23.310]  Chris Trump, other people I really look up to and bounce an idea off of.
[01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:27.070]  Like people like that and, you know, kind of build your circle of people that you can
[01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:29.790]  trade ideas of and build upon them.
[01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:37.470]  We have a great resource on my discord and actually, actually Trevor, he's got a great
[01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:43.150]  one as well, open libraries, people that want to check out for, you know, different files
[01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:46.030]  and different to educate themselves in different books and stuff like that.
[01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:51.470]  So just spend a little bit of time every day, just improving your mind and your education
[01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:52.190]  on this stuff.
[01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:56.590]  And even if it's 30 minutes or 15 minutes, you'll eventually be able to like kind of
[01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:59.390]  chip away and get to where you want to be.
[01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:03.070]  That and just luck and being at the right time.
[01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:08.030]  You know, I got into it in the cannabis trade back in the States, in Philadelphia when it
[01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:12.910]  was black market days, when you can get good prices and then jumped out to Colorado and
[01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:17.710]  when I could do it and do it legally and then ran with it from there because it was, you
[01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:22.350]  know, lucky enough to be an early, early on person in the commercial side and get some
[01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:27.470]  experience dealing with the regulatory side and license applications and, you know, dealing
[01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:31.150]  with the Canadian government and writing an application and getting granted a license
[01:11:31.150 --> 01:11:33.390]  for an extraction facility in Canada was insane.
[01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:40.750]  You know, a 45 page application was 1800 pages front and back when we finished the application.
[01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:46.110]  You know, that, that going through that whole process, writing out full SOPs for an entire
[01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:50.750]  cultivation and extraction facility and all that really, that was another big thing is
[01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:54.190]  writing out your whole processes, you know, make sure if you do that, it'll help you a
[01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:58.590]  lot and then figure out what you're doing that maybe you can learn more about to improve
[01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:59.710]  upon and stuff like that as well.
[01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.390]  I don't know.
[01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:02.830]  I'm just kind of rambling a little bit, but.
[01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:09.150]  No, I mean, it's all the stuff you're touching on is, is completely pertinent.
[01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:14.030]  You know, I lived in Washington for a little bit and looked into, you know, me and my wife
[01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:18.030]  looked into what it would take to, you know, get a license in Washington state.
[01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:21.710]  And I was, I was honestly overwhelmed.
[01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:24.990]  You know, I looked at, at all the different forms and all the different things that needed
[01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:25.550]  to happen.
[01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:27.950]  And I was like, shit, I was like, this is the job in itself.
[01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:32.430]  Just learning how to fill out these farms, you know, like I'm the simple farmer who likes
[01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:37.390]  to breed, you know, like let alone business, let alone all this stuff.
[01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:44.670]  It's like, you know, hyper recorded and, you know, all of your standard operating procedures
[01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:48.190]  and all of those things, you know, respect, man.
[01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:54.110]  I mean, it's, it, it takes a lot to do those things and still have love for the plant,
[01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:57.310]  you know, and still, I mean, it takes a lot for sure.
[01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:00.830]  What was your stint in Canada?
[01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:04.750]  Like, I did some work with a couple of different companies.
[01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:11.870]  I did work with Green Relief Incorporated, which I had some issues with one of their
[01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:16.830]  exec anyways, I should probably not legally comment on that, but I had some issues with
[01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:18.510]  some of their executives, we'll leave it at that.
[01:13:19.630 --> 01:13:25.230]  And, and that didn't turn out so well, but that's, that's, you know, how a lot of that
[01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:26.270]  stuff ended up going.
[01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:30.350]  We had a big issue with the company I was working with in Medicine Hat, where we had
[01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:34.670]  one of our executives siphoning money out of the company and that caused a bunch of
[01:13:34.670 --> 01:13:37.870]  drama with, with investors and some other stuff as well.
[01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:43.230]  So, you know, that, that seemed embezzling people trying to embezzle money seems to be
[01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:47.150]  a common problem in the cannabis industry, unfortunately, especially in Canada.
[01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:57.710]  Just, yeah, so I guess that was the quick and dirty and also a couple other people that
[01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:58.990]  micro lessons as well.
[01:13:58.990 --> 01:14:01.550]  I've worked with in Quebec and Nova Scotia.
[01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:03.150]  Interesting.
[01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:07.710]  I, I lived in British Columbia from 16 to 19.
[01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:09.410]  Okay.
[01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:12.990]  And I'm an ice hockey player, so I moved there to play hockey.
[01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:16.750]  And I actually, when I moved there, I thought, okay, I'm going to quit smoking weed.
[01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:17.790]  I'm moving to Canada.
[01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.810]  Yeah.
[01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:23.870]  You know, I was like, sorry, go.
[01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:25.950]  Not in BC.
[01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:26.190]  Yeah.
[01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:29.950]  I mean, I, you know, I moved into like the, they call it the lower mainland.
[01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:37.150]  So basically like, you know, right in the suburbs of Vancouver and it was very similar
[01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:38.990]  to where I live in the Bay Area.
[01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:40.030]  Very, very similar.
[01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:41.390]  It's like a Canadian version.
[01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:46.110]  And then I discovered the weed there and I discovered that the weed there was actually
[01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:48.750]  a lot cheaper than it is in California.
[01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:56.590]  And yeah, you know, I started smoking hash oil in Canada.
[01:14:56.590 --> 01:15:03.630]  I made some hash oil in Canada and I guess, geez, this was in like 98.
[01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:12.190]  And that wasn't that common in California, at least in my crew, like making hash oil.
[01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:14.670]  But in British Columbia, it wasn't that big of a deal.
[01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:20.190]  And, you know, we would do hot knives and honey spoons and all that kind of stuff.
[01:15:20.190 --> 01:15:26.430]  And it was, I mean, I'm sure there was many people that did this, but I would love to
[01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:30.750]  give myself credit as one of the people that brought hot knives to California because when
[01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:36.510]  I was 16 and 17 years old, I, you know, make visits to the Bay Area during Christmas and
[01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:40.190]  the summer, and I would bring all my tech to the boys in Cali.
[01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:42.510]  And, you know, I'd bring like hot knives.
[01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:43.710]  They'd never seen that.
[01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:49.390]  And honey spoons and all kinds of, you know, Canadian lingo and, you know, Canadian ways
[01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:51.470]  of smoking joints and stuff like that.
[01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:57.710]  And yeah, it was a good time to live in Canada during that time.
[01:15:57.710 --> 01:16:05.070]  It's a lot more innocent, less of a police state, you know, like if you got rolled on
[01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:09.310]  by the cops for smoking weed, they wouldn't really like rough you up or anything.
[01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:13.070]  They just kind of would give you a hard time and tell you to kind of, you know, go on your
[01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.570]  way.
[01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:22.270]  So that was, so I'm always interested to hear people's takes on the Canadian cannabis
[01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:27.950]  scene, because I was kind of in that before it, I guess, before it became legal, you know,
[01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.790]  and all that kind of whatnot.
[01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:32.270]  Well, the black market scene is great.
[01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:36.750]  I mean, I was, I should probably get a little bit careful about what I say, but I mean,
[01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:40.350]  I used to go up there all the time to Montreal when I lived in Philadelphia when I was younger.
[01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:44.590]  You know, we used to do the, we run every other weekend there for a little while.
[01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:45.090]  So.
[01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:46.590]  Heck yeah.
[01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:54.750]  No, I mean, I, I mean, I grew up part of my, you know, important parts of my life were
[01:16:54.750 --> 01:17:00.110]  in Canada and, you know, I, it really holds a special place in my heart.
[01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:07.790]  I, I love, you know, Canadians are my, are my peeps and, you know, it's, it's, it's a
[01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.550]  really nice, it's, it's a nice place.
[01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:10.510]  I like the vibes.
[01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:16.110]  There's tons of outdoor activities and what are you showing me there?
[01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:17.070]  Oh, is that a bong?
[01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:19.710]  Is that a proper Thai bongs?
[01:17:19.710 --> 01:17:23.950]  This is, is a clay and a bamboo.
[01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:30.030]  This is like, let's talk about like, I feel like if you're like in the hood in Thailand
[01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:34.110]  or like just hanging out with the local villagers, like this is a good chance.
[01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:35.230]  They're going to break this out.
[01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:37.390]  That's sick.
[01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:41.310]  So like people do smoke out of like sweet bamboo bongs out there.
[01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:44.830]  Like, Oh yeah, I actually have a video of how this one was made.
[01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:50.510]  I had one made for a friend of mine when he came out, his brother also smokes weeds and
[01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:54.510]  and we sent him home with one to take to him as a gift.
[01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:57.070]  So, but, but yeah.
[01:17:58.590 --> 01:17:59.390]  Nice.
[01:17:59.390 --> 01:18:02.830]  And you said that there's like little smoke shops that you can smoke in that are like
[01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:03.630]  quasi legal.
[01:18:03.630 --> 01:18:04.350]  What are those like?
[01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:05.150]  Yeah.
[01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:07.070]  So like, it kind of depends, right?
[01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:12.270]  So like in Bangkok and, and the big cities, the tourist areas, they're going to enforce
[01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:19.390]  the rules a little more, except for like, like Kho San street and Bangkok, you can kind
[01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:22.190]  of like, they'll sell whippets and they'll kind of like balloons.
[01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:28.750]  You can buy nitrous by the balloon full and order it with your beer and a joint like that.
[01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:29.790]  They don't care.
[01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:30.350]  They don't care.
[01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:36.190]  But if you're not in those little like party zones, you know, it's not really tolerated
[01:18:36.190 --> 01:18:38.510]  so much there, but out like where I live.
[01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:43.070]  And then like, cause I live in Petra boon and Petra boon is like not tourist at all.
[01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:49.150]  So out here, like the places I've like lounge areas and stuff like that, some places in
[01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:52.510]  Bangkok do too, but you don't have the shop in the lounge.
[01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:56.590]  It'll be like a different floor or a different room or like separated, you know?
[01:18:56.830 --> 01:19:00.030]  So that's kind of cool, but it's nice to be able to, a lot of times with the bars and
[01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:02.830]  stuff too, to just be able to like order a joint.
[01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:06.030]  If you forget your weeds or you burn through all your weed, you can just order a little
[01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:11.230]  weed and, and, you know, sit there and have your dinner or whatever else you're having
[01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:13.710]  at the restaurant, depending on where you're at.
[01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:20.430]  But that's not usually as, as above board as some of the other places, but I don't know.
[01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.990]  It's nice.
[01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:24.350]  Again, we're going to a big event this weekend.
[01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:27.070]  We're going to a big event this weekend, tomorrow night.
[01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:33.070]  And it's supposed to be a big, one of the first big events out here at Petra boon as
[01:19:33.070 --> 01:19:34.350]  far as cannabis stuff goes.
[01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:36.190]  So that'll be a lot of fun tomorrow.
[01:19:36.190 --> 01:19:42.670]  Then 420, we have a big cannabis event we're going to be doing, working with down in Bangkok.
[01:19:42.670 --> 01:19:46.670]  So kind of be our first time presenting or doing anything down there.
[01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:54.190]  I'll be giving a talk on cultivating out here and then also just hanging out and smoking
[01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:55.630]  and hanging out with people that are attending.
[01:19:55.630 --> 01:19:57.630]  So that's awesome.
[01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:01.230]  So your name is potent Ponics.
[01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:06.590]  Are you a, do you, do you grow aquaponically?
[01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:12.750]  Is that, do you use fish, extra excrements for fish water for your plants?
[01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:13.870]  Yep.
[01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:17.310]  In fact, all of our flowering buildings here are all aquaponics.
[01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:22.750]  We have a, a 2 million gallon pond that's next to our, our greenhouses.
[01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:28.510]  We have a secondary additional one that's almost as large that will be filled up here
[01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:28.830]  soon.
[01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:33.150]  That'll be backup water basically for the rest of the farm long-term.
[01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:34.910]  But we have a ton of different fish in there.
[01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:42.110]  There's snakeheads, tilapia, clown knife fish, catfish, bunch of feeder fish.
[01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:43.630]  You know, there's betas in there.
[01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:44.750]  There's guppies in there.
[01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:47.630]  There's all kinds of stuff living in there.
[01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:50.670]  And that water gets pumped up into pre-mixed tanks.
[01:20:50.670 --> 01:20:55.470]  And then we amend that based off of what we need the water to have and adjust the pH
[01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:55.790]  down.
[01:20:55.790 --> 01:21:00.110]  If the pH is like seven, seven, two until the rainy season comes back.
[01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:01.870]  So we have to lower the pH as well.
[01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:06.270]  So we can kind of adjust the nutrients of the, what goes directly to the plants and
[01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:11.070]  then the runoff, because we're only using organic inputs for the most part, or in very
[01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:12.510]  low levels than the ones that aren't.
[01:21:13.630 --> 01:21:16.750]  That just runs, the runoff goes down through plumbing back into the pond.
[01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:19.550]  So we're just reusing that water as much as we're able to.
[01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:20.670]  That's cool.
[01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:22.590]  I was assuming that it was going to be a drained waste.
[01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:23.790]  So it's not drained waste.
[01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:27.710]  It goes back to the pond and then we, you know, we reuse it.
[01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:29.630]  That's awesome.
[01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:37.710]  Um, what I, my guessing is that you would need to add a few supplements for flowering.
[01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:38.350]  Is that correct?
[01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:39.230]  Or not necessary?
[01:21:40.190 --> 01:21:45.070]  Yeah, we definitely boost the potassium in particular, um, uh, is the biggest thing.
[01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:49.310]  And then we'll also hit them with like, uh, uh, when they first get transplanted and
[01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:54.110]  then they switch over, we'll hit them with a little malaria, manganese, just to make
[01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:58.270]  sure they have their targets for that, uh, for purple and for THC levels.
[01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:03.310]  Um, but, uh, also helps a little bit with stress, you know, uh, silica as well.
[01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:07.150]  We're seeing a little bit of heat stress, which we hit them with a little extra, um,
[01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:09.390]  aloe vera, uh, helps a lot with that.
[01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:13.150]  That's so exciting.
[01:22:13.150 --> 01:22:18.670]  Um, how did the, I mean, how did those plants taste?
[01:22:18.670 --> 01:22:20.270]  Like I would assume they'd be dang.
[01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:22.510]  Yeah, we have a really good one.
[01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:25.390]  They're actually just finishing up the first cure of the first ones right now.
[01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:28.430]  I haven't actually smoked except for some CBD runs.
[01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:33.150]  We had somebody give us some CBD starts and I was like, I don't want these anywhere near
[01:22:33.150 --> 01:22:33.630]  the gross.
[01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:37.470]  We have a tiny little, it's like a shed size greenhouse.
[01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:38.110]  That's a screen.
[01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:40.270]  It's just like the other screen house plastic on top.
[01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:45.390]  But, uh, if somebody just gives us some random clones, they just go in there because I don't
[01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:46.910]  want to bring bugs into the garden.
[01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:51.550]  So, um, we flowered those out and that one came out like a, like a peach chocolate, peanut
[01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:54.670]  butter cup CBD strain, which was really interesting.
[01:22:54.670 --> 01:23:00.430]  So we have some seeds of that, but, uh, everything else that I've done so far has been, uh,
[01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:05.310]  this is hanging up and we'd be able to smoke it here for four 20.
[01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:07.070]  We'll have a whole bunch of different cultivars.
[01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:12.990]  We'll have about, uh, 80 different cultivars that we'll be able to start smoking here by
[01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.630]  four 20.
[01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:15.230]  That's exciting.
[01:23:15.230 --> 01:23:20.670]  What is the, like, what is the terpene difference with, uh, aquaponics versus let's say like
[01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:22.590]  a living soil type of system?
[01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:25.710]  Or do you, we can get much higher total terpenes.
[01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:25.870]  Yeah.
[01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:29.470]  Because we have the aquatic microbes and the terrestrial microbes.
[01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:32.750]  So you get an additional activation of the plants immune system.
[01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:37.950]  Um, you know, we're, we're hitting, you know, four to 6% on a lot of the different strains
[01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:39.390]  that are able to do produce those.
[01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:44.190]  So that sounds super cool, man.
[01:23:44.190 --> 01:23:49.630]  Um, and is this the first time that you've grown aquaponically or have you, have you
[01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:52.030]  done aquaponics to scale in other environments?
[01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:58.110]  Yeah, no, I mean, that's, uh, I've spent my life kind of the last 10 years perfecting
[01:23:58.110 --> 01:24:02.510]  commercial scale, aquaponics, cannabis, and, uh, I have a whole online school, APMJ
[01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:03.310]  class.com.
[01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:08.030]  We teach, um, uh, it's like a full week long aquaponics, cannabis class.
[01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:12.910]  We actually have a new farm tours and a bunch of new content.
[01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:13.550]  We add to that.
[01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:18.030]  So I'm a regularly a couple of times a year to kind of keep the information fresh.
[01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:21.630]  It's a one-time buy, but we add new content to it a few times a year.
[01:24:21.630 --> 01:24:25.310]  So, you know, you kind of buy into that library that that's constantly growing.
[01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:28.990]  That's super exciting.
[01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:35.470]  I definitely, definitely want to follow up on that and, you know, see about, about taking
[01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:36.270]  that class.
[01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:43.790]  Um, cause I re I recall like digging into aquaponics maybe like 20 years ago and just
[01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:47.230]  like seeing some really cool, gosh, it was a Jeff.
[01:24:47.230 --> 01:24:48.910]  It was this guy in Australia.
[01:24:48.910 --> 01:24:53.550]  I don't recall what his name was, but he has this epic aquaponic garden.
[01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:54.910]  He grows in like gravel.
[01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:59.310]  He has like papaya trees and all kinds of really interesting stuff.
[01:24:59.310 --> 01:25:02.430]  And of course, you know, as a stoner, you're like, Oh, like, could we grow weed this way?
[01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:05.230]  And, you know, it just kind of was like left at that.
[01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:09.790]  And then Murray, sorry, Murray home.
[01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:10.350]  Yes.
[01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:10.590]  Yeah.
[01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:11.550]  That's him.
[01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:15.710]  And, um, like randomly, this is awesome that you're on.
[01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:22.830]  Cause randomly, I know I've, I've definitely heard your, heard you on various podcasts
[01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:24.110]  and I was like growing with the fishes.
[01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:27.390]  I'm like, I'm like, I've heard of that, you know?
[01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:34.350]  So I've definitely, um, you know, I've definitely heard some of your shows before and yeah,
[01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:41.870]  I mean, I think it's a, I mean, it's just a really exciting way to cultivate and, you
[01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:43.550]  know, it's just, Oh man, that was cool.
[01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:46.590]  When you hit that bong, if he disappeared in the smoke.
[01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:52.750]  Um, yeah, I mean, it's just like, like to me, like, that's like what cannabis is like
[01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:58.350]  the gateway is into like KNF and aquaponics and all these different ways of growing and
[01:25:58.350 --> 01:26:03.710]  all these, like, you know, different ways of learning about the, you know, the biosphere
[01:26:03.710 --> 01:26:10.990]  and nature and all, you know, all, all that to me is like, is the medicine is, you know,
[01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:16.670]  like why I'm so drawn to this is because the other people that are also drawn to it are
[01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:22.270]  so interesting, you know, and have so much, like have so much to teach that it's like,
[01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:27.870]  Oh yeah, like I can look into aquaponic cannabis gardening and all of the different
[01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:29.630]  ins and outs of that.
[01:26:29.630 --> 01:26:34.670]  I mean, like for me, honestly, what I would really love to do is to have, have an aquaponics,
[01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:42.430]  have like a fish tank at the top of my property and to be able to water the fish solids to
[01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:45.150]  my garden and then refill my tank.
[01:26:45.150 --> 01:26:48.350]  And that's kind of like the way that I think it would be really cool to do it.
[01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:56.030]  And also it seems like that would add, you know, the amount of nutrient density that
[01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:58.430]  that would add to your garden would be second to none.
[01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:02.990]  And it seems like that would kind of be similar to adding like grazing animals to your land.
[01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.870]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:08.590]  But instead of it being like an actual, instead of it being a moving, a four legged animal,
[01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:10.830]  it would just be fish and like their excrements.
[01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:16.030]  Is that, is that kind of what the fish adds to your, to the, your soil?
[01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:17.790]  Absolutely.
[01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:17.950]  Yeah.
[01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:19.870]  So it's basically like fish manure.
[01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:24.590]  So the difference is, is that it tends to be higher in nitrates and lower in ammonia,
[01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:32.750]  which the plants have to convert in order to, from nitrates back to ammonia, they tend
[01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:33.630]  to grow faster.
[01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:38.110]  You just have to make sure you back off the feeding rate of the fish when you're late
[01:27:38.110 --> 01:27:39.070]  in the flower.
[01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:43.070]  You don't want to get those plants too much nitrogen because they'll get larfy and they
[01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:45.630]  won't get that, that nugs that you're looking for.
[01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:51.550]  So, or switch over to like an omnivorous or a herbivorous fish that's going to have
[01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:52.670]  much less nitrogen.
[01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:58.510]  In general rule of thumb is the more protein percentage in the fish food, the more nitrogen
[01:27:58.510 --> 01:27:59.470]  output you're going to get.
[01:28:00.190 --> 01:28:04.990]  So keep that in mind with the fish species that you're, you're keeping if you're trying
[01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:06.990]  to dial it in on it, especially on bigger scales.
[01:28:08.110 --> 01:28:09.870]  Do you guys eat the fish?
[01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.550]  Oh yeah.
[01:28:12.190 --> 01:28:16.990]  And I actually have a post of the picture on Instagram of a huge clown knife that we
[01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:18.030]  caught the other day in there.
[01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:19.390]  And yeah, we cooked that up.
[01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:23.550]  So do you like, how big is your pond?
[01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:39.000]  Um, about a football field long, maybe not quite like two to 300 feet long and then 40
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.720]  feet wide, 50 feet wide maybe.
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:45.640]  And then 25, 30 feet deep.
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:47.400]  So it's like a lake.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:49.240]  Yeah, it's huge.
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.120]  Yeah.
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.800]  And so do you fish in the lake?
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:54.840]  Yeah.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.160]  That's so awesome.
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:07.360]  Because when, when the flooding comes, like all the water comes and we have a little spillway,
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:07.600]  right?
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:14.240]  So when the rice fields flood, it'll like spill over to top the ponds off and then that
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.800]  spills over so that it doesn't get too full.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:22.400]  But when the, because they have different levees and stuff that they do to flood the
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:26.720]  different zones, to flood the fields when the, when the rice, you know, for the rice
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:27.440]  and all.
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:32.720]  And yeah, it's pretty wild because then you get all these different random fish that come
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.160]  washing in from the river.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.560]  You know, that's how we ended up with so many different species in there.
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.160]  You know, we didn't add them.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:42.720]  They just, when the raining season comes, once those weirs open, they flood into top
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.360]  off the ponds and you get whatever comes in, you know.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.600]  That's really, that's cool.
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.160]  And there's also huge rice culture there.
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.680]  Yeah, we're surrounded by rice fields all around us.
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:00.720]  In fact, the greenhouses are, where the greenhouses are was a rice field last wet season.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.160]  Man.
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:04.800]  Okay.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:12.400]  And I mean, it's, is there Thai culture with washing rice and like IMOs and all that stuff
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:12.720]  as well?
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:18.560]  So rice wash they'll use, so they'll do rice wash and they'll ferment it in the sun for
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.400]  two weeks or yeah, two months.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.360]  And then they use that as like a fungal spray.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:30.080]  It's like, I don't know the science behind it or if it's that much different than anything
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:30.720]  else.
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:35.280]  I haven't, I haven't had a chance to microscope it yet, but we're going to try making some.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:40.480]  I just found out about this, my last trip up to Calco and then I mentioned to the people
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:43.280]  here and they're like, oh yeah, it's this one over here.
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:47.920]  And they have, because if you go to any Thai farm, they'll have any, most Thai people that
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:54.480]  grow, they'll have their juicy, which is like, it's really similar to like PSB and KNF, which
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.360]  is like MSG, fish sauce and egg, you know, and they mix it together.
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.680]  Sometimes a little sugar and then they'll mix that together and then put that in the
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:10.000]  sun and that makes like a phosphorus solubilizing, microbial inoculant.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.880]  And then they also do this rice wash and then they'll do sometimes other ones.
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:21.200]  I'm still not fully sure on some of the others, but they also do a fish ferment, which I also
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:22.480]  have a video on my YouTube.
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:31.760]  So we'll buy like 20 or 40 kilos of fish, like small little, like Tetra size fish that
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.760]  the guys get from the river or whatever.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:34.080]  I don't know.
[01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:40.080]  We buy them at the market and then we take those, we put them in big trash cans and then
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:46.720]  we put the IPMO and then we also put, the government gives out these little packets
[01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:52.480]  of like fermentation microbes and different garden microbes for people to have so that
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:54.480]  they're not using chemicals and stuff.
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:59.520]  So we take a little inoculant from the fermentation one that they have for breaking down plant
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:04.080]  waste and we mix it all together with a little bit of water.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:07.760]  And then the other thing that we do with the stuff, and this really seems to help with
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:08.880]  the vigor in the plants.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:17.360]  If you're going to do the FAA this way, make sure you get a bunch of snails as well.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:24.640]  We'll buy like five or 10 kilos of snail shells that's leftover, but they sell at the market.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:27.520]  They pull the snails out for cooking and they have all these shells.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:32.640]  We'll take that and ferment it in because once that starts to break down after about
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:39.760]  14 days, it's so acidic that it just melts those shells and turns it into super bioavailable
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:40.320]  calcium.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:44.560]  So when we mix that all together and feed it to the plants, they have less nitrogen
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:47.520]  and calcium and the plants really just kind of take off.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.320]  That's super interesting.
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:59.360]  So the government, you said that the government supplies people with organic IMOs?
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:00.800]  Yeah.
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:06.240]  So anybody in Thailand that's trying to grow vegetables, every household can get so many
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:14.160]  packets a month at local agricultural extension or whatever the Thai equivalent is.
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:19.920]  And then I don't have any packets here at the house, but I do at the farm, but they're
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:23.760]  like little packets of microbes that you can get from the government.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:30.160]  And we just get the ones for the fish ferment just because it doesn't take much, right?
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:34.560]  We can make five or eight trash cans from one little tiny packet just because you're
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:37.200]  sprinkling the microbes into inoculated, right?
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:38.080]  You don't need much of it.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.280]  You just need to get them started.
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:41.520]  That's awesome.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:48.320]  So basically the government is really encouraging people to grow organically?
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:51.120]  I mean, can you elaborate on that a little bit?
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:52.240]  Yeah.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.800]  They have little packets for bio controls.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:58.560]  It's like a Bavaria bossiana and Metarizum and something else mix.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.520]  And it's like a little garden kit.
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:05.920]  They have this is for this, and this is for that, and this is for this, and this is for
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:12.480]  like your compost and whatever, whatever that the government gives out here, which is a
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.200]  pretty cool program.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.080]  What is the implication behind that?
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:20.800]  They're trying to feed everybody and get them to adopt better practices.
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:26.400]  So they give it out for free to kind of be like, here, learn how to do it.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.440]  We'll provide it for you.
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:29.040]  Which I think is great.
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.400]  That is great.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:36.000]  I mean, I've never heard of a country doing that.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.720]  Maybe there's some South American countries that are doing that, but are you?
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:45.200]  In Zimbabwe, they had a supplement in Jamaica too.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.360]  They had stuff that was subsidized, right?
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:52.240]  So like they're cheap, like they still cost money, but the government pays for like a
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:56.400]  large percentage of the seed from the government seed shop.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:01.680]  And then in Zimbabwe, they had like, you could get, so if you had a farm above a certain
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:08.240]  size, you could get like so much of certain seeds for every acre or whatever.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:14.000]  And then if you bought so much, you get more for free or whatever.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:14.960]  Does that make sense?
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:15.200]  Yeah.
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.560]  So like you buy enough for your first acre and they'll give you the one for the second
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.280]  acre kind of thing.
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:26.320]  I mean, that sounds, it's kind of sad because to me, man, I'm getting a little
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:26.720]  echo.
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:30.880]  I'm sorry, let me see if I can fix it on my end.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.520]  If it's bad, I can switch to headphones.
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:35.920]  I think it's okay.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.040]  Oh, that's way better.
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:37.360]  Thank you.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.480]  It's sad that to me, this sounds like such a novel idea.
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:45.760]  It makes complete sense.
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:53.280]  I guess just living in the United States for most of my, I mean, being from here, that
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.120]  sounds like such a crazy idea, but I mean, it's not really.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.160]  They're just encouraging their people to grow organically.
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:05.840]  And that's, man, that made me feel kind of sad, though.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:16.080]  In the United States, that's so far off of the conversation of subsidizing organic agriculture.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.520]  That's awesome that you're a part of that.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.040]  That's really awesome.
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:27.600]  And that's awesome that you're sharing that with people that we could think that that
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:28.480]  is a possibility.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:32.960]  Yeah, that's really awesome.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:34.480]  I mean, it makes complete sense.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:37.360]  It does make complete sense.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.680]  Especially if we're trying to change practices to like, away from toxic chemicals and stuff.
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:48.320]  That's how you're going to do it and actually get people to adopt it.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:48.960]  You know what I mean?
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:49.920]  Yeah.
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:52.160]  Yeah.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:59.040]  Are there, I mean, I assume there is also a lot of agribusiness pressure in Thailand
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:36:59.440]  as well.
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:01.040]  Is that?
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:08.400]  Yeah, I mean, you have a lot of different types of agriculture here, but depending on
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:12.800]  where you are, I mean, if you're out more east of here, they have a lot of elephant
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:13.280]  problems.
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:18.880]  Elephants eating people's crops, which is something you don't have to deal with in the
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:19.280]  States.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:22.960]  Yeah, man.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.400]  Yeah, man.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.040]  Um, man, so interesting.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:40.390]  Um, is there anything that you would like to touch on that I haven't, I haven't gotten
[01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:41.030]  into?
[01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:44.230]  I think we're kind of rounding the end.
[01:37:44.230 --> 01:37:46.550]  I might have like one or two more questions, but.
[01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:51.830]  I would just say like anyone that's thinking about just jumping off and trying to run to
[01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:57.990]  the tropics to grow, um, read up on how to grow vegetables and other crops here before
[01:37:57.990 --> 01:38:01.910]  you just run and do that, because you will get your ass handed to you if you just show
[01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:04.390]  up and think that you can grow like you can Cali style.
[01:38:05.110 --> 01:38:07.430]  Um, you know, the bugs are different.
[01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:09.030]  The humidity is different.
[01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:14.630]  The design of greenhouses is different to deal with those type of the heat in particular,
[01:38:14.630 --> 01:38:17.270]  having a double split top and things like I call it.
[01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.510]  I'm sorry.
[01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:21.750]  I didn't mean to bump the mic double split top at the top of the greenhouse to double
[01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:22.230]  split top.
[01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:22.710]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:38:22.710 --> 01:38:26.710]  I didn't mean to jump that heat out from both sides, things like that.
[01:38:26.710 --> 01:38:31.590]  Like learn about these different types of methods that you have to know about for these
[01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:36.710]  tropical places before you, you jump in with both feet into a place like this so that you
[01:38:36.710 --> 01:38:37.670]  will be successful.
[01:38:37.670 --> 01:38:39.190]  And then also like.
[01:38:40.150 --> 01:38:44.870]  One thing that we always do too is take a, you know, 150, 200% of the clones that you
[01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:45.590]  need.
[01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:48.790]  If you run into a bump or two, okay, it's fine.
[01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:49.030]  Right?
[01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.910]  Greenhouses.
[01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:53.430]  And we have some stuff that we can sell and then we have backups for everything, you know,
[01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:55.350]  so make sure you always kind of have.
[01:38:56.150 --> 01:39:00.230]  Buffer room so that you can have some stuff go wrong and immediately replace it with fresh
[01:39:00.230 --> 01:39:01.510]  plants and stay on schedule.
[01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:07.030]  If you do run into a tiny problem or some kind of, you know, electrical failure and
[01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:11.270]  all your fans fail and the greenhouse cooks off or stuff happens once in a while, right?
[01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:13.270]  Like circuit breakers blow.
[01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:16.790]  I've seen like ants get a new electrical box and fry it like.
[01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:19.750]  All kinds of weird stuff happens, you know?
[01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:21.270]  So.
[01:39:24.650 --> 01:39:26.650]  How, how many years have you been growing in the tropics for?
[01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:29.770]  Off and on.
[01:39:30.810 --> 01:39:33.850]  Oh, a total probably five years in total.
[01:39:33.850 --> 01:39:36.250]  If I added up all the different years in different places.
[01:39:36.250 --> 01:39:40.570]  But like, let's say off and on when have you like when you started growing in the tropics
[01:39:40.570 --> 01:39:41.370]  to now?
[01:39:41.370 --> 01:39:45.450]  Oh, I, the first time I grew was in 2016 in Jamaica.
[01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:46.410]  Okay.
[01:39:46.410 --> 01:39:48.170]  And then compared to now, like I.
[01:39:49.690 --> 01:39:53.770]  I am so much wiser about bio controls and then also like.
[01:39:55.690 --> 01:40:00.090]  I think the other thing too is I don't panic anymore when I run into problems like when
[01:40:00.090 --> 01:40:03.770]  you're young, a little bit younger and stuff like that, you're like, oh, shit, what do
[01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:04.330]  I do?
[01:40:04.330 --> 01:40:04.890]  How do I get?
[01:40:06.090 --> 01:40:08.250]  You know, you don't know the answers to all this stuff.
[01:40:08.250 --> 01:40:12.570]  And then now, like, I'm not saying I know all the answers by any means, but I know,
[01:40:12.570 --> 01:40:14.330]  OK, a fun little thing.
[01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:17.690]  OK, I know a couple of different things I can throw at it and it's something's going
[01:40:17.690 --> 01:40:21.530]  to stick it, you know, and then I can once I know kind of what what it's weak to, then
[01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:25.130]  I can I can hit it hard with a couple of different versions of that or whatever.
[01:40:25.130 --> 01:40:26.250]  Same thing with bugs, right?
[01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:28.890]  Like, OK, it's got six legs.
[01:40:28.890 --> 01:40:29.290]  Cool.
[01:40:29.290 --> 01:40:36.250]  Bavaria, Baltiana, Metirizum, IPMO, that combo is going to kill 98% of them, right?
[01:40:36.250 --> 01:40:38.170]  Or it's got, you know, it's a mite.
[01:40:38.170 --> 01:40:38.730]  OK, cool.
[01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:47.130]  So we're going to hit it with white oil and wood vinegar and maybe, you know, a neem oil
[01:40:47.130 --> 01:40:52.410]  if it's in veg to knock them down, you know, so it just depends on what it is that we're
[01:40:52.410 --> 01:40:56.890]  dealing with, what stage of growth, but, you know, kind of have an adaptation of stuff.
[01:40:56.890 --> 01:41:02.090]  And then, too, that's one of the other things is finding different sourcing, different things
[01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:06.170]  and different bio controls and different oils like we don't have soft oil X here, which
[01:41:06.170 --> 01:41:08.490]  is something that everyone kind of swears by in the States.
[01:41:08.490 --> 01:41:13.370]  We have to go with agricultural white oil, which is very similar in application here.
[01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:17.290]  But, you know, if you don't know that and you're not used to dealing with like sourcing
[01:41:17.290 --> 01:41:21.610]  things based off of active ingredients and things like that, it can be really hard to
[01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:28.090]  jump from market to market and find those same products without having because, you
[01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:35.530]  know, and I've seen grows out here where they've imported, you know, was it lost coast of plant
[01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:41.530]  spider mites and then they got like a bunch of West Coast nutrients and mammoth pea and
[01:41:41.530 --> 01:41:46.250]  all that stuff. And listen, I love a call on the mammoth pea and everything, but like
[01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:50.330]  you're importing that from the United States to here, like the amount of money that you're
[01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:56.010]  spending just to import stuff is like, holy crap. So like you got to keep your costs down
[01:41:56.010 --> 01:42:02.970]  and do and make sure that you're, you know, keep it. That's probably been the biggest
[01:42:02.970 --> 01:42:06.490]  thing that surprises me is seeing how many people are still relying on Western
[01:42:08.490 --> 01:42:15.370]  like brands for your inputs. Like, come on, make your own nutrients and source the same
[01:42:15.370 --> 01:42:20.010]  active ingredients with your pest controls. Not only that, but we have better pest controls than
[01:42:20.010 --> 01:42:25.370]  you guys do. We have combination stuff. It's combo, but very bossy on a metirizum. I have
[01:42:25.370 --> 01:42:32.250]  one that's a six in one that has like militaris and I say, if you have a seracia and like,
[01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:40.250]  it's basically like a nuclear bomb for anything with six legs, it's freaking great that we have,
[01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:45.690]  that we use in our rotation now. You know, so, you know, we have a lot of different,
[01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:48.970]  one thing that's interesting too, is the wood vinegar. You know, we, I don't think I've ever
[01:42:48.970 --> 01:42:53.690]  seen that in United States and that really does add like a bit of a vigor to the plants. I
[01:42:53.690 --> 01:42:58.090]  definitely noticed the plants are a little, you know, they're always praying the day after we
[01:42:58.090 --> 01:43:03.610]  spray it in the evening, the next day. So I've never heard of wood vinegar.
[01:43:04.490 --> 01:43:09.290]  So it's like a vinegar that, that they run through with, I don't know if it's sugarcane smoke
[01:43:09.930 --> 01:43:15.930]  or it's some kind of, or if it's rice hull smoke, it's one or the other, but they like boil it and
[01:43:15.930 --> 01:43:22.250]  like a bong kind of where they run the smoke through the oil and it like smells like a barbecue
[01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:27.690]  when you spray it in there, but it kills a lot of the bugs and especially mites. It's really good
[01:43:27.690 --> 01:43:35.770]  against the mites out here as a preventative and the vinegar is kind of acidic. So it kills the
[01:43:35.770 --> 01:43:41.370]  powdery mildew or any molds or anything on the leaf surface. And it, if you know, you don't
[01:43:41.370 --> 01:43:46.570]  want to want to spray it, you know, in the flower, but in veg in particular, it works extremely well,
[01:43:46.570 --> 01:43:50.970]  or even an early flower, you can use it to, you know, if you're having a bit of an emergency,
[01:43:50.970 --> 01:43:56.010]  it's certainly something that, you know, seems to work extremely well here and
[01:43:57.450 --> 01:44:00.010]  not have any kind of negative side effects that we've noticed.
[01:44:01.130 --> 01:44:10.490]  That's awesome. Wood vinegar. Well, shoot, I think I'd like to wrap her up around here.
[01:44:12.730 --> 01:44:19.450]  I would love for you to email me some of the resources that you were mentioning during the
[01:44:19.450 --> 01:44:24.970]  podcast, just so I can, you know, like, you know, put up as much stuff to like, you know,
[01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:32.650]  rep, you know, your podcast and the class that you're teaching, you know, and anything else like
[01:44:32.650 --> 01:44:44.410]  that. When I air this live, I'm going to probably run through your Instagram. So like while you're
[01:44:44.410 --> 01:44:48.730]  talking, you can also show pictures of some of your stuff, which I think will be super cool.
[01:44:51.850 --> 01:45:04.570]  Gosh. I think that's pretty much it. Dude, thank you. Thank you very much for coming on.
[01:45:05.770 --> 01:45:09.610]  I mean, we've never really like met or talked before this. So it's really awesome that you're,
[01:45:09.610 --> 01:45:14.250]  you know, extremely friendly and open to share with the community what you've been up to. And
[01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:23.690]  you already are sharing your own stuff. And, you know, oh, yeah. So yeah. Okay. No, I did say that.
[01:45:25.450 --> 01:45:30.250]  When we were talking about Jamaica too, I have videos of like the whole field of stuff and
[01:45:30.250 --> 01:45:34.650]  flour and then the veg stuff with the field that were short. You can put that up too,
[01:45:34.650 --> 01:45:37.130]  if you want to talk while we're talking about that, if that helps you.
[01:45:38.010 --> 01:45:38.650]  I would love to.
[01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:44.490]  I have something visual to follow along with. Both of those videos are like the first couple
[01:45:44.490 --> 01:45:48.890]  on my main page when you go to my YouTube. So if that helps you have something visual
[01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:53.850]  on the screen while you're doing it, since that's recorded, feel free to.
[01:45:53.850 --> 01:45:57.290]  So you have the YouTube, which is growing with the fish?
[01:45:58.330 --> 01:45:59.130]  Potent Ponyx.
[01:45:59.370 --> 01:46:08.650]  Potent Ponyx. And what is your website?
[01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:13.690]  My website is potentponyx.com.
[01:46:16.650 --> 01:46:19.690]  And the Open Nutrient Project is opennutrientproject.com.
[01:46:20.650 --> 01:46:29.160]  And my podcast is on all podcast apps, Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, Google,
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:32.280]  every platform really.
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:36.360]  And you said that you, what was the apmj.com?
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:42.520]  apmjclass.com. That's my, I have a whole school on Teachable.
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:50.200]  If you're ever going to do your own educational stuff, Teachable is by far the best platform.
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:55.240]  It's not the cheapest. It's like, I don't know.
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:02.840]  If you get it in Christmas time or like when it's on sale, it's like a thousand bucks.
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:06.440]  But otherwise it's like 1200 bucks a year for the tier that we have.
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.400]  But like once you have that, they don't take any cut off of it the rest of the time.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:15.640]  So I can sell as much as I want and they get $0 of that.
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:18.520]  And they have really good, like within 12 hours,
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:20.600]  they've always been really on point with tech support.
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:25.560]  And we've had them for four and a half, five years that we've hosted our classes.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:27.640]  I have three classes on there.
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:31.560]  I have a pest control class and the aquaponic cannabis class.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:35.880]  And I have a couple of others that I'm, I have them almost completed
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:37.400]  or I have the stuff filmed and stuff.
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:40.760]  I just have to finish editing and cutting it down and formatting it.
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:45.000]  But if you're ever looking to do something like that,
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.280]  it's definitely the best platform.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:47.560]  They also have a cheap one too.
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:49.160]  It's like 300 bucks a year.
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:52.120]  And then they take like 8% of whatever your sales are,
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:54.040]  which is not really that bad of a deal either.
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:57.720]  That's really neat.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:02.680]  I've been working with junior colleges teaching cannabis courses.
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:12.600]  So it's cool in that there's less of the backend stuff that I have to organize myself.
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:18.840]  But I'm just, I'm really happy to see more people getting into teaching
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:21.720]  and the information in this industry.
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:25.320]  Because for a long time, it was kind of like a hidden information
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:28.040]  that only certain people got to know.
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:31.160]  And it's great that everybody should have that information.
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:33.800]  And I also think it's important that people who learn it
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:38.120]  should be able to get paid, compensated for the work that they put in
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.280]  because then it gives them time to make it even better.
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:44.360]  Yeah, I haven't figured out that part of it yet.
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:48.920]  But at least the school part of it does definitely puts a little money in my pocket.
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.840]  But the podcast certainly doesn't.
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:55.800]  I also put on the virtual Aquaponic Cannabis Conference every year.
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:00.760]  If you haven't checked that out, we have three years of conferences on that.
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:06.600]  Each year, we had at least 24 hours of content each year.
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.840]  So be sure to check that out.
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:13.240]  Really unique talks, really interesting talks,
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:17.560]  incredible talk on Hoplite and Byroid from Kevin McKernan this last year.
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:19.480]  And some other great stuff.
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:20.680]  So definitely check that out.
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:23.240]  For sure, man.
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:25.320]  Thank you so much, Steve, for coming on.
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:28.040]  I really appreciate it.
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:32.760]  If you are ever in the California Bay Area, hit me up.
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.440]  Let's smoke some bowls.
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:37.160]  Have you interviewed Wayne Justman?
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:38.300]  No.
[01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:39.820]  You should.
[01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:43.820]  If you need his contact info, just send me a text.
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:44.300]  Let me know.
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:45.180]  I can send it to you.
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:50.060]  He was the first person to get a medical cannabis card.
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:54.620]  And he was good friends with Dennis Perone.
[01:49:54.620 --> 01:49:55.100]  Oh, yeah.
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:56.460]  And the whole Perone clan.
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:59.180]  I actually knew Dennis Perone the last two years of his life.
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:02.860]  And spent quite a bit of time at the castle there for a little bit.
[01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:03.900]  And I was living in the Bay.
[01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:06.380]  Awesome.
[01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:06.880]  Yeah.
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:11.660]  I'm from the Bay Area, so I'm partial.
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:18.060]  But I really love the way that 215 was set up.
[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:21.500]  What Dennis Perone and all those people were about.
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:23.980]  How they started as medicine.
[01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:27.340]  And the whole collective aspect.
[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:32.220]  I mean, that really got people like me into this industry.
[01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:35.260]  And now it's more corporate.
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:39.260]  But the people, there still is that vibe behind it.
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:45.580]  And I guess to the listeners, the name of the show is the East Bay Seed Collective Show.
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:48.380]  Because we are a seed collective out of the East Bay.
[01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:52.940]  And the purpose of our collective is to share genetics.
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:55.420]  To pheno hunt together.
[01:50:55.420 --> 01:51:00.220]  And to generally just work together as a collective to push forward this plant.
[01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:02.460]  To push forward this plant.
[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:07.900]  And this podcast is an extension of that.
[01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:13.740]  And I always encourage other people to work together with their community.
[01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:18.220]  To produce, to make the world a better place.
[01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:21.660]  I mean, whether it's cannabis or social justice.
[01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:25.100]  Or food, education, whatever.
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:29.740]  It's about us being here together to make the world we live in a better place.
[01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:33.100]  Yeah.
[01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:35.100]  So yeah, man. Thank you.
[01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:37.100]  I will stop this podcast.
[01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:39.100]  I will stop it right now. End recording.
