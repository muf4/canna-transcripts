[00:00.000 --> 00:03.540]  Well, we're here today with Dave and Laura Lee of Sunrise Mountain Farms,
[00:03.540 --> 00:06.940]  and we're going to learn a little bit about their farm and their flowers that they have.
[00:06.940 --> 00:09.540]  So, hey guys, how's it going?
[00:09.540 --> 00:09.940]  It's going well.
[00:09.940 --> 00:11.740]  Good. Good to see you guys.
[00:11.740 --> 00:15.260]  Tell us a little bit about how you got started in cannabis.
[00:15.260 --> 00:17.060]  Like what's the background?
[00:17.060 --> 00:24.180]  For me, I've always had a love of cannabis ever since I was a teenager.
[00:24.300 --> 00:27.580]  Just moving out to Humboldt County,
[00:27.580 --> 00:33.340]  I actually came here because it was just a really beautiful place that talked to me and called me in.
[00:33.340 --> 00:41.020]  Then being here, I got my eyes opened up to the cultivation side of things,
[00:41.020 --> 00:46.220]  and I just felt like it was something I just started to play with because I just love cannabis.
[00:46.220 --> 00:51.220]  Then next thing I knew, I just really connected with it and found myself immersed in it.
[00:51.220 --> 00:53.460]  Yeah. How long has that been for you?
[00:53.460 --> 00:55.900]  It's been 21 years now.
[00:55.940 --> 00:57.940]  Wow. That's a stretch.
[00:57.940 --> 00:58.740]  Yeah.
[00:58.740 --> 00:59.740]  That's amazing.
[00:59.740 --> 01:03.420]  So, as far as what you do for farming,
[01:03.420 --> 01:07.460]  I mean, is it more for the- some people do it for the plant,
[01:07.460 --> 01:09.180]  some people do it for the people.
[01:09.180 --> 01:11.940]  It's like where do you stand with-
[01:11.940 --> 01:14.980]  I mean, I kind of like play well in both of that.
[01:14.980 --> 01:17.740]  It's like the connection to the plant,
[01:17.740 --> 01:21.340]  but it's the medicine that it's creating that's going to the people.
[01:21.340 --> 01:24.140]  Amazing. Yeah, for sure. It's cool.
[01:24.140 --> 01:28.420]  Yeah. I got into cannabis also about 20 years ago.
[01:28.420 --> 01:31.780]  Well, actually longer, about 22 years ago.
[01:31.780 --> 01:35.340]  When I started, it was in Southern Humboldt,
[01:35.340 --> 01:40.660]  and I got to learn from people who had been doing it for like 20 years before me.
[01:40.660 --> 01:44.380]  So, I feel like it was kind of a privilege to learn from people who had been growing
[01:44.380 --> 01:47.820]  organically in harmony with nature,
[01:47.820 --> 01:52.780]  but still like they were gorilla growing actually.
[01:53.740 --> 01:59.780]  But in like a really kind of sustainable way where it wasn't like trashing nature.
[01:59.780 --> 02:04.900]  And then I also got to work with people who were working,
[02:04.900 --> 02:07.020]  breeding a lot of different strains.
[02:07.020 --> 02:09.820]  And so that was really exciting for me
[02:09.820 --> 02:12.540]  because I was finding medical benefit from it,
[02:12.540 --> 02:14.220]  and that was really exciting.
[02:14.220 --> 02:20.660]  So, for me, I've always wanted to bring organic medicine to people.
[02:20.660 --> 02:24.740]  Yeah, it sounds like you guys have been doing it for quite some time now.
[02:24.740 --> 02:27.460]  You want to talk a little about Sunrise Mountain Farms?
[02:27.460 --> 02:30.740]  Like what makes your farm, you know, your farm?
[02:30.740 --> 02:35.900]  Yeah. I purchased the property about 18 years ago
[02:35.900 --> 02:38.860]  and have been cultivating there for 18 years.
[02:38.860 --> 02:43.260]  It's super very small scale, of course, for medical cannabis.
[02:43.260 --> 02:49.660]  And yeah, and so we've had a long time to work in that location
[02:49.660 --> 02:52.420]  and really get to know our terroir
[02:52.420 --> 02:55.180]  and really get to know like what works and what doesn't work
[02:55.180 --> 02:59.700]  and the influences of the climate and the soil
[02:59.700 --> 03:02.220]  and even different locations on our property.
[03:02.220 --> 03:03.940]  Yeah, I was curious about that because you guys,
[03:03.940 --> 03:05.660]  I watch you guys on Instagram a lot.
[03:05.660 --> 03:08.500]  I haven't been to your farm yet, even though I would like to visit,
[03:08.500 --> 03:11.180]  but I see you guys are up at higher elevations.
[03:11.180 --> 03:12.940]  What is it? 20 something?
[03:12.940 --> 03:15.780]  Yeah, it's about 2200 feet.
[03:15.780 --> 03:18.300]  The property ranges between 22 and 26.
[03:18.300 --> 03:22.180]  The farm itself is probably right in the middle of that.
[03:22.180 --> 03:25.500]  And so, yeah, and, you know, it's been, you know,
[03:25.500 --> 03:28.860]  we talked about like 18 years and so the property has been
[03:28.860 --> 03:35.300]  like a slow evolution of what our vision has been, you know.
[03:35.300 --> 03:37.700]  And so it's not like this.
[03:37.700 --> 03:42.740]  We came in and like a lot of people just bulldoze and put a garden in.
[03:42.740 --> 03:45.020]  It's like we really connected with the land.
[03:45.020 --> 03:46.620]  We're like homesteading style.
[03:46.660 --> 03:52.540]  So we always grew with fruit trees and plants and, you know,
[03:52.540 --> 03:56.220]  companion planting and permaculture has always been a part
[03:56.220 --> 03:58.620]  of our gardening practices.
[03:58.620 --> 04:04.140]  And we used to work with making teas and just experiment a lot
[04:04.140 --> 04:07.420]  because back like 15, 20 years ago, you know,
[04:07.420 --> 04:11.340]  there wasn't really very much knowledge about growing cannabis.
[04:11.340 --> 04:14.340]  Like, you know, now you can like just look up anything.
[04:14.340 --> 04:20.100]  But we were just really like, really fun and exciting to like experiment with it.
[04:20.100 --> 04:23.300]  It was also scary at times when there's like helicopters flying,
[04:23.300 --> 04:25.700]  you know, we're like in danger.
[04:25.700 --> 04:32.500]  But yeah, so it was just really cool to be part of that kind of time.
[04:32.500 --> 04:32.940]  Yeah.
[04:32.940 --> 04:33.620]  It's amazing.
[04:33.620 --> 04:37.460]  Did you have anything unique, you know, that you do like something that,
[04:37.460 --> 04:43.020]  you know, you do in your farm, like mulching, compost teas, you know,
[04:43.020 --> 04:44.300]  recycling anything?
[04:44.300 --> 04:50.420]  The past five years, I've been getting into the KNF and JADAM methodology.
[04:50.420 --> 04:55.140]  So really just breaking away from buying any nutrients and just really looking
[04:55.140 --> 04:59.060]  to the land and also sourcing stuff that are more like, you know,
[04:59.060 --> 05:00.740]  organic fruits and vegetables.
[05:00.740 --> 05:05.580]  And then finding every year is always so much more learning that goes in with that.
[05:05.580 --> 05:14.540]  And so being able to take old products and turn it into fertilizer, you know,
[05:14.540 --> 05:20.980]  forest microbes and the IMOs and just the ferments and just bringing that into the
[05:20.980 --> 05:25.140]  fold and not having to rely on store-bought products.
[05:25.140 --> 05:29.820]  And our results every year have been getting better.
[05:29.820 --> 05:31.020]  It's been pretty amazing.
[05:31.020 --> 05:34.500]  So it's like seems like the more we're breaking away from that and just getting
[05:34.540 --> 05:36.460]  into this idea.
[05:36.460 --> 05:39.900]  And to go back also with what Lorelei was saying when we got started,
[05:39.900 --> 05:45.020]  like we had our gardens mixed in with our fruit trees and our vegetables.
[05:45.020 --> 05:48.860]  And because of regulation, we had to switch a lot of things around.
[05:48.860 --> 05:52.460]  So we had to move our garden spots.
[05:52.460 --> 05:57.460]  And so our garden itself, like, you know, it's like part of it is older,
[05:57.460 --> 06:02.260]  but really a lot of it is newer because we had to move things around and,
[06:02.300 --> 06:06.900]  you know, just consolidated parts because we had these little micro climates.
[06:06.900 --> 06:07.380]  Yeah.
[06:07.380 --> 06:08.980]  The apple tree, then the bed.
[06:08.980 --> 06:09.500]  Yeah.
[06:09.500 --> 06:13.860]  All these interlaced operating systems and permaculture.
[06:13.860 --> 06:15.140]  And now it has to be like...
[06:15.140 --> 06:18.380]  Now it's like this area that's, here's the cannabis, you know?
[06:18.380 --> 06:19.300]  And so...
[06:19.300 --> 06:24.620]  And so now we're working on like that kind of newer garden to add more plants and
[06:24.620 --> 06:26.220]  fruit trees to that area.
[06:26.220 --> 06:30.900]  And when we did move our gardens, we actually took some of that old soil,
[06:30.900 --> 06:35.140]  a lot of that old soil, and we moved it to the new site because we've been soil
[06:35.140 --> 06:39.260]  building for 15 years, you know, more than, yeah, for the years.
[06:39.260 --> 06:39.700]  Yeah.
[06:39.700 --> 06:42.020]  So, yeah, we've been soil building.
[06:42.020 --> 06:45.020]  So we wanted to bring that, you know, to the new garden site.
[06:45.020 --> 06:47.460]  And so we're working on developing that more there.
[06:47.460 --> 06:48.340]  It's amazing.
[06:48.340 --> 06:54.020]  And then also like how to capture water just by how you're designing your plot,
[06:54.020 --> 06:54.340]  you know?
[06:54.340 --> 06:57.700]  So we have a slope, so we worked with swales, you know?
[06:57.700 --> 07:01.740]  So on the slopes, we have our swales to capture all that rainwater and hold that
[07:01.740 --> 07:03.380]  snow when it does come down.
[07:03.380 --> 07:08.140]  And right below that, we did mounds because it flattens out a little bit to kind of help
[07:08.140 --> 07:09.580]  capture any kind of runoff.
[07:09.580 --> 07:13.780]  And then we just store that water as it's raining and coming down when it's present
[07:13.780 --> 07:15.700]  so it's there for the plants later on.
[07:15.700 --> 07:16.380]  Like better...
[07:16.380 --> 07:20.140]  Are you talking about storing in an above ground or just in the actual soil?
[07:20.140 --> 07:21.180]  In the actual soil.
[07:21.180 --> 07:22.060]  So it just stays...
[07:22.060 --> 07:27.220]  So if the beds are nearby, the moisture level general in the ground is higher.
[07:27.220 --> 07:31.100]  It's like a permaculture technique where it's like swales will kind of collect the
[07:31.100 --> 07:32.140]  water, you know?
[07:32.140 --> 07:33.260]  So, yeah.
[07:33.260 --> 07:33.780]  Yeah.
[07:33.780 --> 07:38.460]  So it's been really like awesome to be able to implement all these different ideas into
[07:38.460 --> 07:43.940]  what Sunrise Mountain is now and what we're shaping it and forming it to be, you know?
[07:43.940 --> 07:49.420]  Because now in our new area that we are farming, we are going to incorporate the companion
[07:49.420 --> 07:55.020]  planting and the fruit trees again and start bringing in these elements that kind of make
[07:55.020 --> 07:55.900]  it more of a whole...
[07:55.900 --> 07:56.940]  Amazing, yeah.
[07:56.940 --> 07:57.940]  ... holistic kind of thing.
[07:57.940 --> 07:59.500]  Do you think you guys are going to do like...
[07:59.500 --> 08:03.020]  Because I don't know, in my mind, it's like if you have to have the cannabis plot in one
[08:03.020 --> 08:08.100]  area, then like the borders on the outside of that would be where you have the permaculture
[08:08.100 --> 08:10.140]  systems like running down.
[08:10.140 --> 08:11.540]  Yeah, it works best that way.
[08:11.540 --> 08:16.420]  I mean, we do also, we kind of experiment every year with like growing plants, companion
[08:16.420 --> 08:20.660]  planting like within the cannabis beds too, but then sometimes that can block airflow
[08:20.660 --> 08:21.260]  and things.
[08:21.260 --> 08:24.460]  So it has to be the right kind of plants like chamomile.
[08:24.460 --> 08:25.740]  Yeah, I love chamomile.
[08:25.740 --> 08:26.260]  Yeah.
[08:26.260 --> 08:28.020]  I planted carrots one year, two years ago.
[08:28.020 --> 08:29.020]  Oh, really?
[08:29.020 --> 08:31.460]  I planted a huge row of carrots down in the cauliflower bed.
[08:31.460 --> 08:32.460]  Nice.
[08:32.460 --> 08:34.460]  And it was wild how many ladybugs came in.
[08:34.460 --> 08:35.460]  Oh, really?
[08:35.460 --> 08:36.740]  It was really, it was, I'll show you some photos.
[08:36.740 --> 08:37.740]  It was wild.
[08:37.740 --> 08:38.740]  Oh, yeah.
[08:38.740 --> 08:39.740]  That's good.
[08:39.740 --> 08:40.740]  That's good to know.
[08:40.740 --> 08:41.780]  Yeah, carrots, I mean, the only thing, a caveat I would say is that there's increased water
[08:41.780 --> 08:48.140]  usage and increased fertilization requirements to maintain both plants.
[08:48.140 --> 08:50.220]  What I tried this year was the potatoes.
[08:50.220 --> 08:54.940]  And I actually, I will follow Nick on Green Source Gardens, you know?
[08:54.940 --> 08:55.940]  He kind of turned me on.
[08:56.620 --> 09:00.740]  I listened to this podcast with him and Shango Loves, actually, and it was really good.
[09:00.740 --> 09:03.340]  And I just was like, oh, potatoes, man, I'm going to try that.
[09:03.340 --> 09:07.300]  And actually, it was awesome because it created an awesome living mulch.
[09:07.300 --> 09:11.220]  And then you're eating potatoes throughout the year and it didn't interfere with the
[09:11.220 --> 09:12.220]  plants at all.
[09:12.220 --> 09:15.660]  And actually, it was kind of nice because what I found with that living mulch, because
[09:15.660 --> 09:19.900]  it was a little higher, it made my plants not so much just go outward to fill their
[09:19.900 --> 09:22.020]  space, they came up a little bit.
[09:22.100 --> 09:25.900]  And also, when the potatoes started to die back and it came time for pruning time, it
[09:25.900 --> 09:29.500]  really, like, the plant structure was better.
[09:29.500 --> 09:32.100]  It was helped shape by that higher living canopy.
[09:32.100 --> 09:33.700]  Can you do me a favor?
[09:33.700 --> 09:35.340]  Because I'm a stickler for detail sometimes.
[09:35.340 --> 09:39.340]  Can you give me an idea of the base planting?
[09:39.340 --> 09:42.620]  So the potatoes were planted around the base of the plants?
[09:42.620 --> 09:43.900]  I can give you exactly.
[09:43.900 --> 09:46.580]  It's a 40-foot row that's four feet wide.
[09:46.580 --> 09:48.660]  And I have the plants running right down the center.
[09:48.660 --> 09:50.660]  And I had the potatoes right along the edges.
[09:50.660 --> 09:51.660]  Oh, perfect.
[09:52.300 --> 09:53.300]  That's very clear.
[09:53.300 --> 09:54.300]  Oh, cool.
[09:54.300 --> 09:55.300]  I might try that.
[09:55.300 --> 09:58.860]  I just planted a row of garlic, so maybe on the other side I'll try potatoes this year.
[09:58.860 --> 10:02.620]  And another plus to that, too, is also if you have rodent problems, like ground rodent,
[10:02.620 --> 10:06.020]  moles and voles and things, they don't really particularly like the potatoes because they
[10:06.020 --> 10:07.020]  get in the way.
[10:07.020 --> 10:08.020]  Oh, interesting.
[10:08.020 --> 10:11.780]  So all of a sudden, you're creating another barrier that, you know, a lot of the stuff
[10:11.780 --> 10:15.780]  we've done in developing is also wiring our beds to keep the ground rodents out.
[10:15.780 --> 10:17.740]  But there's always ways they find their way in.
[10:17.820 --> 10:20.820]  So that's a unique to you guys' situation because I don't have...
[10:20.820 --> 10:23.100]  We're not very far apart.
[10:23.100 --> 10:28.500]  Maybe as a crow flies five or ten miles, but I'm only at 200 feet into the valley.
[10:28.500 --> 10:29.500]  And I don't have any...
[10:29.500 --> 10:30.900]  We don't have any problems with rodents.
[10:30.900 --> 10:31.900]  Oh, really?
[10:31.900 --> 10:34.940]  There'll be like one errant one that comes through once in a while.
[10:34.940 --> 10:35.940]  Gotcha.
[10:35.940 --> 10:36.940]  So you guys have to deal with that.
[10:36.940 --> 10:37.940]  Yes.
[10:37.940 --> 10:38.940]  For sure.
[10:38.940 --> 10:39.940]  Ah, see, the complexities of farming.
[10:39.940 --> 10:40.940]  They're real.
[10:40.940 --> 10:42.940]  Every site has its own complexities.
[10:42.940 --> 10:43.940]  It's so true.
[10:43.940 --> 10:44.940]  That's so cool.
[10:44.940 --> 10:45.940]  Well, yeah, I'm going to try the potatoes.
[10:46.140 --> 10:50.580]  I remember I got tuned in with the potatoes from Alpenglow.
[10:50.580 --> 10:54.820]  Craig was telling me about it because I was researching symphilins and dealing with symphilins.
[10:54.820 --> 10:59.740]  And maybe the potatoes were actually like a good addition to a garden to kind of mitigate
[10:59.740 --> 11:00.740]  maybe their problem.
[11:00.740 --> 11:01.740]  It gives them a food to go to.
[11:01.740 --> 11:02.740]  Right.
[11:02.740 --> 11:03.740]  As opposed to the root systems.
[11:03.740 --> 11:04.740]  Yeah.
[11:04.740 --> 11:06.740]  But then there's the argument of like why you're attracting them in too.
[11:06.740 --> 11:07.740]  Right.
[11:07.740 --> 11:08.740]  And you're breeding.
[11:08.740 --> 11:09.740]  I know it's all very valid.
[11:09.740 --> 11:11.620]  I don't think the science is settled on that.
[11:11.620 --> 11:14.740]  But it's an interesting time to research it.
[11:15.540 --> 11:16.540]  Well, cool.
[11:16.540 --> 11:18.100]  That's really interesting about your farm.
[11:18.100 --> 11:19.100]  I appreciate it.
[11:19.100 --> 11:22.140]  I think now we should look and check out your really cool flowers.
[11:22.140 --> 11:23.140]  Awesome.
[11:23.140 --> 11:24.140]  Yeah.
[11:24.140 --> 11:25.140]  See what you guys got here.
[11:25.140 --> 11:26.580]  What are we looking at here?
[11:26.580 --> 11:28.820]  So that is our hot berry.
[11:28.820 --> 11:31.540]  So that there is a new strain.
[11:31.540 --> 11:35.140]  We phenohunted that and we actually bred that on the property.
[11:35.140 --> 11:36.420]  Oh, sweet.
[11:36.420 --> 11:43.980]  It's our creme de luna, which is a cultivar that we've been growing now for 12 years.
[11:44.220 --> 11:47.420]  And it's also crossed with this triple berry goo.
[11:47.420 --> 11:48.420]  Oh yeah.
[11:48.420 --> 11:49.420]  I can.
[11:49.420 --> 11:50.420]  Yep.
[11:50.420 --> 11:57.420]  Afgoo crossed with blueberry, razzleberry and I'm kind of like.
[11:57.420 --> 11:58.900]  Oh man, it's berry.
[11:58.900 --> 11:59.900]  It's so berry.
[11:59.900 --> 12:00.900]  And I don't know.
[12:00.900 --> 12:01.900]  It's berry with a sour.
[12:01.900 --> 12:06.140]  It has a sour thing and it almost has a hint of cheese or something.
[12:06.140 --> 12:08.060]  Yeah, it's like a creamy.
[12:08.060 --> 12:09.060]  It's probably the creme de luna.
[12:09.060 --> 12:12.060]  I mean, everyone's got different factory, you know, you pick up different scents.
[12:12.060 --> 12:13.060]  Yeah.
[12:13.140 --> 12:14.140]  Wow.
[12:14.140 --> 12:15.140]  Yeah, it's really complex.
[12:15.140 --> 12:16.140]  It's a complex profile.
[12:16.140 --> 12:21.620]  And I mean, again, like is it I hate to use the word since we're trying to get away from
[12:21.620 --> 12:22.620]  indica and sativa.
[12:22.620 --> 12:25.140]  But this is really like a kind of a balanced hybrid.
[12:25.140 --> 12:30.020]  So our creme de luna, which we've been growing for 12 years, like you said, it's super indica,
[12:30.020 --> 12:36.860]  really good for sleep, muscle spasms and relaxing and really good for like bringing your focus
[12:36.860 --> 12:38.700]  in the creme de luna.
[12:38.700 --> 12:43.500]  Yeah, really like bring your focus into one focus or quieting your mind at the end of
[12:43.500 --> 12:44.500]  the day.
[12:44.500 --> 12:46.500]  It's really high in muricine.
[12:46.500 --> 12:51.940]  And so we cross that with more of a daytime strain, which is the berries, the triple berry.
[12:51.940 --> 12:53.460]  And so that brings it.
[12:53.460 --> 12:55.380]  There's pinene in it.
[12:55.380 --> 13:00.180]  So yeah, so it's actually muricine, pinene, really berry flavors.
[13:00.180 --> 13:04.620]  And there's a lot of there's some sesquiterpenes in there.
[13:04.620 --> 13:07.900]  There's like a lot of kind of microterpenes in there.
[13:08.100 --> 13:09.820]  So it's super frosty.
[13:09.820 --> 13:10.820]  Was this super frosty?
[13:10.820 --> 13:11.820]  Yeah, interesting flavor.
[13:11.820 --> 13:12.820]  Was this outdoor?
[13:12.820 --> 13:13.820]  This is outdoor.
[13:13.820 --> 13:14.820]  Really?
[13:14.820 --> 13:15.820]  Yeah.
[13:15.820 --> 13:16.820]  Wow.
[13:16.820 --> 13:17.820]  This is really high quality outdoor.
[13:17.820 --> 13:18.820]  Thank you.
[13:18.820 --> 13:19.820]  Yeah.
[13:19.820 --> 13:20.820]  Yeah, we were really stoked on its structure.
[13:20.820 --> 13:23.060]  I mean, the plant itself is just, it's just a beauty.
[13:23.060 --> 13:24.900]  She really just wants to be admired.
[13:24.900 --> 13:32.300]  Big fat trichomes on these beautiful formation buds and long colas, you know.
[13:32.300 --> 13:36.060]  And I think the, I know people are so into THC.
[13:36.060 --> 13:38.100]  I think the THC on that was 32%.
[13:38.100 --> 13:40.980]  Oh, hey, that doesn't hurt.
[13:40.980 --> 13:41.980]  And then total cannabinoids.
[13:41.980 --> 13:42.980]  I mean, total cannabinoids were 37 or something like that.
[13:42.980 --> 13:43.980]  Yeah, something like that.
[13:43.980 --> 13:44.980]  I think so.
[13:44.980 --> 13:45.980]  Yeah.
[13:45.980 --> 13:46.980]  Pretty strong stuff.
[13:46.980 --> 13:47.980]  DZ3.
[13:47.980 --> 13:48.980]  DZ3.
[13:48.980 --> 13:58.980]  Now DZ3 is a dozisose bred by Greenfire Dynetics.
[13:58.980 --> 14:03.940]  We are coining it the DZ3 to help.
[14:03.940 --> 14:06.420]  We have two different phenos that we grow on the farm.
[14:06.420 --> 14:11.740]  And so we want to have a different name to kind of like just help the customers understand
[14:11.740 --> 14:14.240]  that there are two different cultivars.
[14:14.240 --> 14:18.940]  And they're different from each other because one leans towards Skittles, one leans more
[14:18.940 --> 14:19.940]  towards Do-Si-Do.
[14:19.940 --> 14:20.940]  So the Do-Si-Do crosses Skittles.
[14:20.940 --> 14:21.940]  Yeah.
[14:21.940 --> 14:22.940]  Yeah.
[14:22.940 --> 14:23.940]  And you can complete, I smell the Skittles.
[14:23.940 --> 14:24.940]  Yeah.
[14:24.940 --> 14:27.300]  It's got that real candy and with the gas.
[14:27.300 --> 14:30.100]  With that gas mix, it's a candy gas.
[14:30.100 --> 14:31.100]  Candy gas.
[14:31.100 --> 14:32.100]  Candy gas.
[14:32.260 --> 14:34.260]  And the Custies or the Custies will pass.
[14:34.260 --> 14:36.460]  DZ3 leans towards the Skittles for sure.
[14:36.460 --> 14:37.460]  Yeah.
[14:37.460 --> 14:38.460]  This is nice.
[14:38.460 --> 14:39.460]  It's really nice.
[14:39.460 --> 14:40.460]  And it's chunky too.
[14:40.460 --> 14:42.940]  Chunky and the flavor like that nose comes through in the flavor.
[14:42.940 --> 14:43.940]  So good.
[14:43.940 --> 14:47.420]  We actually work with Papa Select with that to make live rosin.
[14:47.420 --> 14:48.420]  Oh nice.
[14:48.420 --> 14:51.860]  And we got 10th and Emerald Cup with that.
[14:51.860 --> 14:52.860]  Excellent.
[14:52.860 --> 14:53.860]  Congrats.
[14:53.860 --> 14:54.860]  So it gets up there.
[14:54.860 --> 14:55.860]  It gets a little, yeah.
[14:55.860 --> 14:56.860]  So it's recognized DZ3.
[14:56.860 --> 15:01.100]  DZ3 is also kind of a more of a hybrid.
[15:01.100 --> 15:05.060]  We like to smoke it during the day or early evening.
[15:05.060 --> 15:08.140]  But yeah, it's super flavorful.
[15:08.140 --> 15:12.100]  It has like a little hint of lemongrass, kind of tropical fruit.
[15:12.100 --> 15:13.980]  It's pretty euphoric.
[15:13.980 --> 15:14.980]  I kind of, I kind of.
[15:14.980 --> 15:15.980]  Yeah.
[15:15.980 --> 15:16.980]  A little bit psychedelic.
[15:16.980 --> 15:17.980]  Yeah.
[15:17.980 --> 15:18.980]  I was going to say, it's kind of trippy psychedelic.
[15:18.980 --> 15:19.980]  Sounds fun.
[15:19.980 --> 15:20.980]  It is.
[15:20.980 --> 15:23.980]  I might have to take a bite of this with me.
[15:23.980 --> 15:24.980]  Yeah, you should.
[15:24.980 --> 15:25.980]  Sweet.
[15:25.980 --> 15:26.980]  Amazing.
[15:26.980 --> 15:27.980]  Okay.
[15:27.980 --> 15:28.980]  All right.
[15:28.980 --> 15:29.980]  Moving along.
[15:29.980 --> 15:30.980]  This is exciting.
[15:31.860 --> 15:32.860]  Strawberry, CBD.
[15:32.860 --> 15:33.860]  All right.
[15:33.860 --> 15:40.100]  So our Strawberry G is a CBD variety.
[15:40.100 --> 15:43.220]  It's like, it changes every year.
[15:43.220 --> 15:44.940]  We've been growing it for about five years now.
[15:44.940 --> 15:50.300]  We pheno hunted it about five years ago, along with a lot of other CBD strains.
[15:50.300 --> 15:54.900]  And we really like this one for the plant structure, the way it grows, and then also
[15:54.900 --> 15:57.180]  the effects.
[15:57.180 --> 15:59.180]  It's usually a two to one.
[15:59.380 --> 16:04.500]  Sometimes it's closer to a one to one, depending on the year and the environmental factors,
[16:04.500 --> 16:06.020]  because it changes slightly.
[16:06.020 --> 16:07.020]  Sure.
[16:07.020 --> 16:10.500]  So you guys are, what makes, I mean, I was going to wait, but I might as well interject
[16:10.500 --> 16:11.500]  now.
[16:11.500 --> 16:17.900]  And what makes your farm unique is you guys, you're, I shouldn't say pheno, cultivar hunting.
[16:17.900 --> 16:19.460]  Cultivar hunting and breeding.
[16:19.460 --> 16:22.340]  You're breeding, as opposed to just like getting what's on the market.
[16:22.340 --> 16:24.100]  You're doing more of your own breeding programs.
[16:24.100 --> 16:26.020]  We love growing our own strains.
[16:26.020 --> 16:28.420]  That's like part of what makes it so fun.
[16:28.660 --> 16:29.660]  Right?
[16:29.660 --> 16:30.660]  I agree.
[16:30.660 --> 16:34.580]  Let's take this amazing strain and that strain and let's make like, you know, I think of
[16:34.580 --> 16:39.100]  like the medicine that that can create for people, like bringing these terpenes together
[16:39.100 --> 16:42.620]  with those or the, you know, these different cannabinoids.
[16:42.620 --> 16:44.460]  You know, it's like we, you know, yeah.
[16:44.460 --> 16:49.100]  And then also, you know, pheno hunting, the amazing work of other breeders too, you know,
[16:49.100 --> 16:54.940]  and so we were able to find these unique cultivars within these amazing genetics, you know, and
[16:54.940 --> 16:55.940]  pick the best one.
[16:55.940 --> 16:58.060]  Actually, I'll give you guys some seeds.
[16:58.220 --> 17:00.380]  I've got some pretty interesting genetics that I was breeding.
[17:00.380 --> 17:01.900]  I should give you guys some afterwards.
[17:01.900 --> 17:03.220]  I would love to try it.
[17:03.220 --> 17:04.220]  Yeah.
[17:04.220 --> 17:07.020]  So the strawberry G's is, we pheno hunted that.
[17:07.020 --> 17:10.900]  It's MTG seeds, strawberry godfather.
[17:10.900 --> 17:15.780]  And so we pheno hunted that and we luckily enough tested and kept that one and found
[17:15.780 --> 17:19.660]  out that it was a CBD and we're like, you know, let's keep this one.
[17:19.660 --> 17:25.940]  And then from that, we're just love smoking it and it's very relaxing and we tend to also
[17:25.940 --> 17:27.460]  make other products out of it.
[17:27.860 --> 17:28.860]  So we do have a tincture.
[17:28.860 --> 17:33.140]  Yeah, we have a tincture there and then we also have a pre-roll that's infused with the
[17:33.140 --> 17:35.380]  keef of the strawberry G as well.
[17:35.380 --> 17:38.380]  So it gives you a little bit more, a little more of a punch.
[17:38.380 --> 17:42.940]  Yeah, I think, I don't know, as I get older, I almost lean more towards the CBD balanced
[17:42.940 --> 17:43.940]  ratios.
[17:43.940 --> 17:51.740]  Balanced ratios, like actually CBD and THC work synergistically together and it just
[17:51.740 --> 17:56.340]  kind of amplifies the medicine, but it also, they balance each other.
[17:56.740 --> 18:01.060]  You might not get as high, but your body's going to feel better.
[18:01.060 --> 18:02.380]  Yeah, exactly.
[18:02.380 --> 18:07.020]  It's really kind of more medicinal because I think like, you know, breeders in the Emerald
[18:07.020 --> 18:10.900]  Triangle here for decades have been growing.
[18:10.900 --> 18:15.460]  You know, we weren't testing things or whatever, so we've been growing for like this euphoric
[18:15.460 --> 18:16.460]  feeling, right?
[18:16.460 --> 18:21.480]  Well, CBD doesn't give you that euphoric feeling, so there's so many strains that are super
[18:21.480 --> 18:24.100]  high THC and people are really into that.
[18:24.620 --> 18:32.020]  The CBD is really great for anxiety or you're just kind of calming their nervous system.
[18:32.020 --> 18:35.820]  I feel like I have a lot of sports injuries, like achy bones.
[18:35.820 --> 18:36.820]  Pain, achiness.
[18:36.820 --> 18:41.460]  It remediates, that's funny, relieves the achiness.
[18:41.460 --> 18:43.700]  Yeah, for me, that's what CBD does.
[18:43.700 --> 18:44.820]  Yeah, it does.
[18:44.820 --> 18:47.180]  It's great for that too, for chronic pain.
[18:47.180 --> 18:52.820]  We've had a lot of people give us feedback about our tincture and smoking the flower.
[18:52.860 --> 18:54.580]  It really works for them.
[18:54.580 --> 18:59.820]  And then also we got feedback from retailers, dispensaries, that that strain was really
[18:59.820 --> 19:02.420]  helping their patients who were having seizures.
[19:02.420 --> 19:03.420]  Oh, wow, yeah.
[19:03.420 --> 19:04.420]  Amazing.
[19:04.420 --> 19:07.180]  Yeah, so it's really good for some people perhaps.
[19:07.180 --> 19:08.180]  That's special, that's great.
[19:08.180 --> 19:10.060]  Don't want to make any medical claims there or anything.
[19:10.060 --> 19:14.900]  It's something that we, it's a cultivar that we grow because we know it's true medicine.
[19:14.900 --> 19:19.660]  You know, and so it's hard to not, it's not like the favorite in the market, but to be
[19:19.660 --> 19:23.180]  honest with you, there's a niche of the market that really looks for that, you know?
[19:23.180 --> 19:30.300]  So it is a medicine and it tends to lean toward those folks who aren't looking for that punch
[19:30.300 --> 19:31.300]  in the face.
[19:31.300 --> 19:35.660]  Maybe it's like, I mean, you correct me if I'm out of place here, but the Boomer market?
[19:35.660 --> 19:37.780]  Oh no, dude, I was told, you're right there with that.
[19:37.780 --> 19:42.420]  My parents come visit me, I give them strawberry gin, they're like, this is the best.
[19:42.420 --> 19:46.740]  I give them something else, they're like, whoa, man, I'm holding on here.
[19:46.740 --> 19:47.740]  Yeah, that's great.
[19:47.820 --> 19:51.980]  And if they can be that pre-roll box, I'd love to open it because it's pretty cool.
[19:51.980 --> 19:57.540]  So we also have the strawberry G in this pre-roll and then it opens up.
[19:57.540 --> 19:59.820]  Oh, it's all sealed up right now.
[19:59.820 --> 20:01.820]  I got a knife if you want this, I can crack it.
[20:01.820 --> 20:02.820]  Okay, there we go.
[20:02.820 --> 20:03.820]  You got it?
[20:03.820 --> 20:04.820]  Boom.
[20:04.820 --> 20:06.820]  So I worked really hard on the packaging.
[20:06.820 --> 20:11.980]  I create all the packaging too and I was working with a box maker.
[20:11.980 --> 20:14.780]  We figured out how to make a triangular box and so.
[20:14.780 --> 20:15.780]  Oh, it's a little tray.
[20:15.780 --> 20:16.780]  Yeah, it's like a little tray.
[20:16.820 --> 20:17.820]  Oh, that's so cool.
[20:17.820 --> 20:20.820]  And that's a picture of the strawberry G plant inside.
[20:20.820 --> 20:21.820]  Oh, that's amazing.
[20:21.820 --> 20:22.820]  So yeah.
[20:22.820 --> 20:23.820]  Terroir matters.
[20:23.820 --> 20:24.820]  Yeah.
[20:24.820 --> 20:25.820]  And then it talks about our terroir.
[20:25.820 --> 20:26.820]  That's really cool.
[20:26.820 --> 20:28.980]  And we try to stay away from plastic.
[20:28.980 --> 20:32.700]  We totally stay away from plastic and mylar because we're really environmentally conscious.
[20:32.700 --> 20:36.060]  And that's a big enough vial to actually reuse for multiple other things.
[20:36.060 --> 20:39.620]  Yeah, we really encourage people to reuse these glass tubes.
[20:39.620 --> 20:41.300]  Yeah, that's lovely.
[20:41.300 --> 20:42.300]  Amazing.
[20:42.300 --> 20:43.300]  Yeah.
[20:43.300 --> 20:45.180]  Well, thanks for sharing all that stuff, guys.
[20:45.180 --> 20:50.100]  I think probably the final question would be, you know, in light of everything that's
[20:50.100 --> 20:53.460]  happened in the industry, like what's one thing you would like to see change?
[20:53.460 --> 20:58.500]  Like if you had to pick just one thing you could change either with education or regulation,
[20:58.500 --> 21:00.380]  what do you think would make the most impact?
[21:00.380 --> 21:05.380]  I think one thing that would really make a huge impact is if we were allowed to sell
[21:05.380 --> 21:08.140]  directly to our consumer base.
[21:08.140 --> 21:13.660]  So farmer market style or just supporting the small farmers in a way that connects us
[21:13.780 --> 21:19.580]  to our consumer base so that the consumer base can really understand what we're doing,
[21:19.580 --> 21:23.300]  what we're creating, where we came from, and what the medicine that we're producing to
[21:23.300 --> 21:26.540]  give to them or bring to them is really all about.
[21:26.540 --> 21:27.540]  I agree.
[21:27.540 --> 21:28.540]  I couldn't agree more.
[21:28.540 --> 21:36.140]  I feel that, you know, avenues to sales for us, you know, more retail.
[21:36.140 --> 21:40.700]  Not having to go through distributors that all have their own brands that they want to
[21:40.700 --> 21:42.860]  always push their own brands first.
[21:42.860 --> 21:44.940]  And then we're kind of like, oh yeah, yeah, let's hide.
[21:44.940 --> 21:49.580]  So if there were distributors that didn't have their own brands and that would work,
[21:49.580 --> 21:52.300]  you know, that model in California I think would work better.
[21:52.300 --> 21:57.180]  But, you know, most people are, you know, pushing their own brand and business as they
[21:57.180 --> 21:58.180]  should.
[21:58.180 --> 21:59.180]  Yeah.
[21:59.180 --> 22:00.180]  Yeah.
[22:00.180 --> 22:01.180]  They're direct to consumer.
[22:01.180 --> 22:02.180]  Yeah.
[22:02.180 --> 22:04.020]  So we do make our own sales.
[22:04.020 --> 22:08.020]  You know, I connect with buyers, myself calling them.
[22:08.020 --> 22:09.020]  Yeah.
[22:09.020 --> 22:15.420]  And actually a lot of the work that I do now is like bookkeeping and really the administrative
[22:15.420 --> 22:19.580]  kind of stuff and sales and marketing and packaging and all this stuff.
[22:19.580 --> 22:25.380]  And so I've kind of transitioned from farming for years to kind of doing the administrative
[22:25.380 --> 22:26.380]  stuff.
[22:26.380 --> 22:28.100]  And Dave is really on the farm more.
[22:28.100 --> 22:30.060]  But yeah.
[22:30.060 --> 22:31.060]  That's amazing.
[22:31.060 --> 22:32.060]  I appreciate that.
[22:32.060 --> 22:33.980]  And I can't wait to try some of your products.
[22:33.980 --> 22:35.540]  I'm very excited actually.
[22:35.540 --> 22:36.540]  So thanks a lot.
[22:36.540 --> 22:37.540]  Yeah.
[22:37.540 --> 22:38.540]  Thank you, Russell.
[22:38.540 --> 22:39.540]  Yeah.
[22:39.540 --> 22:39.560]  Have a good one.
