[00:13.180 --> 00:18.380]  Welcome everybody back to another episode of the Friendly Cannabis Show.
[00:18.380 --> 00:24.300]  We've got a real treat and a sneak peek today. We have author Jeff Lohenfels with
[00:24.300 --> 00:27.540]  us. How are you doing today sir? I'm doing great. Couldn't be doing better.
[00:27.540 --> 00:32.340]  Awesome. That's good to hear. I love the positivity. It's the Friendly
[00:32.340 --> 00:37.140]  Cannabis Show after all. So yes, I like the spirit. Off to a good start.
[00:37.140 --> 00:42.180]  But thank you for making the time to join us today. You know I kind of was
[00:42.180 --> 00:46.980]  mentioning earlier that the entire community thanks you for your
[00:46.980 --> 00:51.780]  contributions, for your work, and the way that you deliver it too. There's a lot of
[00:51.780 --> 00:56.380]  information out there but I personally resonate with the delivery that you have
[00:56.380 --> 01:01.300]  and I think a lot of other people do. And we're getting ready to release a new
[01:01.300 --> 01:09.060]  book. So that's exciting. What made you feel that it was necessary to
[01:09.300 --> 01:14.700]  add to this collection? Yeah, you know, let's go back to the first book and I'll
[01:14.700 --> 01:18.980]  sort of make the parallel between the two if I can. I'm growing my beard back
[01:18.980 --> 01:25.140]  so I'm scratching myself like crazy. You know the first book talks about the soil,
[01:25.140 --> 01:31.460]  introduced the soil food web actually. I mean I'd been reading a lot and talking
[01:31.460 --> 01:36.540]  a lot with Dr. Elaine Ingham and you know it was pretty evident to me that
[01:36.540 --> 01:40.300]  the soil food web was the gospel and yet I couldn't find anything on it. And
[01:40.300 --> 01:45.860]  so I chatted with her and I and you know we decided we set up a list serve. Back
[01:45.860 --> 01:50.220]  then that was what they called these things. And I wrote the book and
[01:50.220 --> 01:57.820]  and it really introduced the concept that we have things going on in the soil
[01:57.820 --> 02:02.940]  that a lot of eating and pooping, let's put it that way, that result in
[02:02.940 --> 02:08.460]  nutrients in the soil. So these nutrients are deposited into the soil by
[02:08.460 --> 02:14.860]  the soil food web activity and then they move into the plant which was described
[02:14.860 --> 02:20.460]  in both teaming with fungi and with teaming with nutrients. They move into
[02:20.460 --> 02:26.020]  the plant two different ways. The first way in 2006 when the book came out was
[02:26.020 --> 02:32.100]  simply based diffusion. I mean the water, maybe interception, but somehow
[02:32.100 --> 02:36.380]  those minerals got close to the root and then they moved into the root cells.
[02:36.380 --> 02:41.300]  Then it came along teaming with fungi because we really discovered that there
[02:41.300 --> 02:46.860]  was quite a bit of nutrient delivery being made by fungi who would take the
[02:46.860 --> 02:53.660]  nutrients from the soil that were released by first of all this activity
[02:53.660 --> 02:58.420]  by the soil food web but also by fungal activity itself because they produce
[02:58.580 --> 03:03.300]  acids and break things down and they move them directly into the plant where
[03:03.300 --> 03:08.020]  once again they moved into the plant cells. Well that's how we thought the
[03:08.020 --> 03:15.340]  soil food web basically operated. We're now becoming quite aware that
[03:15.340 --> 03:23.620]  bacteria also move into the plant and feed the plant internally. And this
[03:23.620 --> 03:27.940]  really shouldn't come as a surprise to us because we know that there's nitrogen
[03:27.980 --> 03:33.820]  fixation going on as a result of bacteria in legumes, some of the cover
[03:33.820 --> 03:39.620]  crops that people who grow cannabis use. And that's just simply bacteria that
[03:39.620 --> 03:45.940]  move into the plant. The plant causes a root hair to hook around the bacteria
[03:45.940 --> 03:51.740]  and they form this bacterioid. They change their form and they produce
[03:52.540 --> 03:59.100]  from inside the plant. Very exciting and an important thing. But not a lot of
[03:59.100 --> 04:05.260]  nitrogen goes into the plant that way and not all plants can form that
[04:05.260 --> 04:14.140]  relationship with the rhizobia bacteria. So along comes a woman whose name I
[04:14.140 --> 04:18.060]  can never pronounce but it's in the book so when people get it they can
[04:18.180 --> 04:25.260]  read it from Australia who was studying plant roots in 2010 thereabouts and
[04:25.260 --> 04:34.620]  discovered what she thought was the roots literally opening up and
[04:34.620 --> 04:41.260]  surrounding the cells as happens in the rhizobia situation and eating the
[04:41.260 --> 04:46.900]  bacteria bringing it inside the cell where they then multiplied these
[04:46.980 --> 04:52.500]  bacteria inside the cell and she called it rhizo for the rhizosphere root.
[04:53.540 --> 04:59.140]  Phagy, rhizophagy. Sometimes I laugh and I say rhizophagy just because it's
[04:59.140 --> 05:06.100]  easier for me to say but it's rhizophagy and it means root eating. Now when you
[05:06.100 --> 05:14.540]  go back to the invention of fertilizers, artificial fertilizers, it was at a
[05:14.540 --> 05:20.140]  period of time when people including the founding farmers of the United States,
[05:20.140 --> 05:23.420]  you know George Washington and Adams and Jefferson and those guys, everybody
[05:23.420 --> 05:29.740]  thought that plant roots literally ate soil and so we rototilled because you
[05:29.740 --> 05:36.140]  pulverize it up and the plant was able to eat it easier. Now we discover as a
[05:36.140 --> 05:41.260]  result of this wonderful discovery made in Australia and then picked up by a
[05:41.260 --> 05:46.940]  gentleman named Dr. Professor, or I should say Professor James White at
[05:46.940 --> 05:53.100]  Rutgers University and he has studied this extensively with his students and
[05:53.100 --> 05:58.620]  now we know that there's something called the rhizophagy cycle which
[05:58.620 --> 06:07.820]  literally is a situation whereby bacteria in the same pool that are in the
[06:07.820 --> 06:12.540]  2006 version of the soil food web, in other words they're attracted to the
[06:12.540 --> 06:19.460]  plant by plant exudates in the 2006 version where we have this diffusion
[06:19.460 --> 06:25.620]  model, they're eaten by nematodes, protozoa who poop out the excess. That's
[06:25.620 --> 06:28.980]  where the nutrients come from. They're in the right form and they move into the
[06:28.980 --> 06:36.380]  plant. Some of those bacteria are tricked by the plant to back up
[06:36.380 --> 06:43.300]  against the root itself down in the meristem where the root cells are
[06:43.300 --> 06:49.220]  just beginning to form. And they're attracted by that exudate, they back up
[06:49.220 --> 06:56.540]  against the wall, the wall weakens a little bit and the bacteria move into
[06:56.540 --> 07:02.860]  the root cells in a zone called a periplasmic space. I'm gonna throw a lot
[07:02.860 --> 07:08.340]  of words out here but basically this is just a little area between the
[07:08.340 --> 07:16.940]  cell wall and the cytoplasm that's held together by a membrane. So you've got
[07:16.940 --> 07:23.140]  the, you've got, you know, I think the easiest thing to think about is when you
[07:23.140 --> 07:29.580]  buy tofu it comes in one of those squares or rectangles. It's full of water
[07:29.740 --> 07:34.660]  and then you've got the tofu. Well that water space around the tofu is a
[07:34.660 --> 07:41.140]  periplasmic space and these bacteria move in through the cell wall into that
[07:41.140 --> 07:47.700]  periplasmic space. Now that tofu is surrounded by a membrane and in that
[07:47.700 --> 07:53.820]  membrane are very specialized proteins that go up. Wait a minute, there's a
[07:53.820 --> 08:01.500]  bacteria coming in here and they spray the bacteria with a oxidized, a very
[08:01.500 --> 08:09.740]  heavy oxygenated set of molecules called ROS. And they spray the bacteria with the
[08:09.740 --> 08:19.980]  ROS and doing so it strips the cell walls off the bacteria and the nutrients
[08:19.980 --> 08:24.300]  that are in those cell walls which contain a lot of metals, some sugars, a
[08:24.300 --> 08:30.300]  little bit of proteins, they go into the plant and the plant uses it. Now the
[08:30.300 --> 08:35.220]  bacteria are producing ethylene because that's one of the things that bacteria
[08:35.220 --> 08:41.140]  do and inside plant cells when you produce ethylene it causes the cells to
[08:41.140 --> 08:49.500]  elongate and stretch. That ethylene is made from one of the exudates that the
[08:49.500 --> 08:54.500]  plant has put out there to feed this particular kind of bacteria. And so it
[08:54.500 --> 09:00.100]  puts out this ethylene and it's got its cell wall being stripped off and it goes
[09:00.100 --> 09:07.300]  wait a minute, this is not tenable. I'm gonna die or I'll get destroyed if I
[09:07.300 --> 09:15.740]  don't fight back against this ROS. And so it produces a nitric oxide, nitric
[09:15.740 --> 09:21.500]  oxide, that combines with some of the stuff that's in there and the
[09:21.500 --> 09:27.620]  ethylene and it turns to nitrate. And the plant uses that nitrate, it
[09:27.620 --> 09:32.780]  absorbs the nitrate. Gives the bacteria a little, the wallness now, a little bit of
[09:32.780 --> 09:38.900]  carbohydrates but it takes that nitrate. So the plant attacks the bacteria, the
[09:38.900 --> 09:46.020]  bacteria in order to protect itself weakens the ROS like an antioxidant and
[09:46.020 --> 09:53.700]  as a result produces nitrogen, fixes nitrogen inside that cell that goes to
[09:53.700 --> 10:01.380]  the plant. And up to 30 or 40 percent of the nitrogen a plant uses can come from
[10:01.380 --> 10:08.460]  this process. Whoa that's pretty amazing. Now it gets even more incredible. So the
[10:08.460 --> 10:15.860]  plant has all this bacteria inside and the bacteria begin to circulate around
[10:15.860 --> 10:20.980]  that periplasmic space. And as they circulate they don't have their walls on
[10:20.980 --> 10:25.900]  anymore. Remember bacteria, maybe don't remember, but bacteria they
[10:25.900 --> 10:31.700]  double, you know, every 20 minutes. Well now they don't have a wall on so maybe
[10:31.700 --> 10:36.380]  it's 15 minutes because it's easier. And they increase their numbers as
[10:36.500 --> 10:41.220]  they're being circulated around by the plant in this periplasmic space. And then
[10:41.220 --> 10:47.180]  you end up getting these things called quads. Four little bacteria stuck together
[10:47.180 --> 10:51.620]  like a beach ball and you get lots of them inside that periplasmic space and
[10:51.620 --> 10:57.180]  they're all producing ethylene causing the root to stretch out a little bit. That
[10:57.180 --> 11:05.540]  root cell stretches out. And the area against the cell wall isn't smooth and
[11:05.540 --> 11:09.620]  slippery. It's got little bumps in it. And so these bacteria as they're
[11:09.620 --> 11:14.660]  circulating around they begin to accumulate in little spots around that
[11:14.660 --> 11:21.140]  cell. And as they accumulate they're still producing ethylene. That ethylene
[11:21.140 --> 11:30.900]  causes a tube to form on the outside of that root cell. And that tube we know is
[11:30.900 --> 11:38.220]  a root hair. So these bacteria are what cause root hairs to form. If you take
[11:38.220 --> 11:45.140]  these bacteria away you don't get root hairs. And we know that this is what
[11:45.140 --> 11:50.820]  happens in particular with cannabis because it's been observed specifically
[11:50.820 --> 11:55.620]  in cannabis. But I can tell you all plants that produce root hairs do so
[11:55.660 --> 12:00.580]  because of the razor fasci cycle. It's the bacteria. And they go into that
[12:00.580 --> 12:04.220]  little tube. They get you know they get freed up from their little stuck spot
[12:04.220 --> 12:08.580]  and they go into that little tube and continue to produce bacteria. And they
[12:08.740 --> 12:17.060]  elongate that hair by the ethylene. And they're blown out of their tip maybe two
[12:17.300 --> 12:23.420]  two or three different times as that bacteria as that hair grows. And they go
[12:23.420 --> 12:32.700]  back out into the soil where they regrow their cell walls and then repeat the trip
[12:32.980 --> 12:40.380]  again. Oh my God. What an amazing thing. It's just incredible. And we didn't know
[12:40.380 --> 12:44.500]  it was happening because we didn't have the microscopy to be able to see it. And
[12:44.500 --> 12:48.660]  we didn't have the test to be able to determine what was happening inside the
[12:48.660 --> 12:52.860]  cell. Otherwise I'm sure Dr. Elaine would have seen it. But it's just one of those
[12:52.860 --> 12:59.420]  things. And so now we have an expanded soil food web where we get food as a
[12:59.420 --> 13:07.020]  result of diffusion mycorrhizal fungi rhizobacteria and now we get nitrogen
[13:07.020 --> 13:13.780]  fixing and the cell wall nutrients as a result of the rhizophagy cycle. Oh my
[13:13.820 --> 13:19.100]  God. Now if that wasn't enough for a cannabis grower because there are ways
[13:19.100 --> 13:27.500]  that you can help this along. It turns out that the trichomes which we all know
[13:27.540 --> 13:34.460]  look very much like root hairs. How did those get there and what do they really
[13:34.460 --> 13:38.580]  do. You know when you read books including including I think the one I wrote on
[13:38.580 --> 13:44.980]  auto flowering cannabis. We we would say we think we think that these trichomes are
[13:44.980 --> 13:51.700]  there to protect the plant from UV rays and and you know that and maybe prevent
[13:51.740 --> 14:01.620]  insects from getting in. But it turns out that they contain bacteria. These same
[14:01.620 --> 14:10.300]  kind of bacteria and these bacteria are causing are reacting with the cell wall
[14:10.540 --> 14:16.060]  inside the trichome. So they're in that stalk that holds the trichome up and they
[14:16.060 --> 14:23.460]  react they react to the cell walls on the outside of that stalk and they fix
[14:23.580 --> 14:30.860]  nitrogen inside that trichome and feed it to the plant. And if you feed the plant
[14:30.900 --> 14:36.820]  artificial nitrogen there aren't as many bacteria and that doesn't happen. Now
[14:37.100 --> 14:43.580]  you know that'd be amazing enough as it is. But we know that these bacteria talk
[14:43.580 --> 14:54.060]  to each other in cannabinoid language. They produce metabolic substances which we
[14:54.060 --> 15:03.820]  know as flavonoids cannabinoids. Holy crow. You mean this may be where. Oh wait a
[15:03.820 --> 15:09.300]  minute. This is where the goodness of the cannabis comes from from these bacteria
[15:09.300 --> 15:14.900]  talking to each other. It looks that way folks. And the research is going on as we
[15:14.900 --> 15:20.980]  speak but it looks that way. And it's simply amazing. Now the trichomes don't
[15:20.980 --> 15:26.860]  form the same way but the activity inside them is definitely nitrogen fixing. And
[15:26.860 --> 15:32.380]  once again this isn't just a tomato plant we're talking about. You've observed it.
[15:32.980 --> 15:40.460]  It's been observed in cannabis sativa. So it's been observed. This is now confirmed.
[15:40.460 --> 15:48.380]  People know what's going on. Holy crow. So this whole new area is described in the
[15:48.380 --> 15:52.660]  book. I have to admit in terms of the trichomes it was more speculation than it
[15:52.660 --> 16:00.900]  was confirmation. And that is really sort of an amazing part of the story. But it
[16:00.900 --> 16:10.820]  gets even better. And that's because some bacteria get inside the the plant and move
[16:11.140 --> 16:17.060]  into other areas of the plant. And they do all sorts of terrific things because they
[16:17.060 --> 16:23.180]  produce all sorts of vital hormones like gibberellic acid and auxins and stuff like
[16:23.180 --> 16:28.500]  that. And so so you want these guys in there. They they they they are good. And
[16:28.540 --> 16:35.460]  all of these bacteria including the rhizophagy bacteria by entering the plant the plant
[16:35.460 --> 16:41.780]  sprays the bacteria to try to kill them off strips the wall off blah blah blah. But the
[16:41.940 --> 16:47.500]  but the plant also sprays itself and it's got to be able to protect itself. And so it
[16:47.500 --> 16:55.620]  increases its own strength and its own ability to handle stresses. Wow. So the
[16:55.660 --> 17:02.740]  implications of all of these things in terms of the cannabis grower are are phenomenal.
[17:02.740 --> 17:05.580]  And obviously we're going to we're going to need to be talking about.
[17:07.260 --> 17:13.660]  100 percent. I think I collectively heard everybody's head pop out. You're talking our
[17:13.660 --> 17:17.780]  language. We love our trichomes. We love the flavonoids. We love the terpenes. That's
[17:17.820 --> 17:21.820]  again that's where the magic happens. A lot of us say we're not you know everything else is
[17:21.820 --> 17:28.060]  biomass. We're growing this for these heads. Right. Well yeah this is really quite
[17:28.060 --> 17:35.180]  something. You know I mean and it's it can only get it can only get more helpful as we go
[17:35.180 --> 17:41.140]  along. I mean you know this whole thing has sort of a built in problem which maybe we
[17:41.140 --> 17:47.620]  ought to discuss before we go any further. And that is bacteria. You know you and I
[17:47.620 --> 17:57.380]  probably know almost nothing about bacteria. And yet we could probably identify five or six
[17:57.380 --> 18:04.340]  dinosaurs. I know that my grandchildren know every dinosaur. You know five and six seven
[18:04.340 --> 18:09.900]  eight years old. They know every dinosaur. They study them from the minute they're born with a
[18:09.900 --> 18:16.700]  dinosaur plush toy. You know and then dinosaur games and then dinosaur books. And then they go
[18:16.700 --> 18:23.460]  to school and they learn about dinosaurs who have been extinct. And other than providing us oil
[18:23.460 --> 18:29.980]  and gas which turns out not to be so good for us. What good are they. And yet bacteria which
[18:30.340 --> 18:36.940]  comprise our bodies and feed our plants and do all these terrific things not to mention can kill us.
[18:37.140 --> 18:42.500]  We know nothing about. So so we've got to be thinking about bacteria before we go any further.
[18:42.980 --> 18:49.460]  They are incredibly small and anybody who's listening to this show should immediately Google
[18:49.460 --> 18:56.580]  bacteria head of a needle or head of a pin and take a look and see those pictures that are out there
[18:56.580 --> 19:03.180]  images. And you can see that when you say bacteria you shouldn't be thinking of a couple of cars in
[19:03.180 --> 19:10.260]  the in the in the driveway. You should be thinking of the parking lot at the Atlantic Heartfield
[19:10.380 --> 19:17.620]  Airport. There's zillions of them. They double in their quantity. They breed like crazy. So they
[19:17.620 --> 19:27.060]  multiply every 20 minutes and and they're everywhere. But they're small and we can't see them. And so
[19:27.060 --> 19:35.020]  they're hard if not impossible to identify. Now the good news is we're getting to the point where we are
[19:35.020 --> 19:42.380]  going to be able to as growers identify the bacteria and the fungus that's in our soil. And we're
[19:42.380 --> 19:47.180]  going to be able to do it probably with our cell phones. When you think about it I mean the
[19:47.180 --> 19:53.420]  databases are already there. It's just a question of figuring out how to use the camera so that we can do
[19:53.420 --> 20:02.220]  this stuff. We can already take a sample of our spit for example and send it in and find out our DNA our
[20:02.220 --> 20:10.940]  health what we're allergic to. So and we can send in soil and you can get a very expensive test which
[20:10.940 --> 20:17.420]  will tell you what life you have in your soil including the bacteria. But it's coming closer and
[20:17.420 --> 20:26.700]  closer and closer to being able to do it yourself on an inexpensive basis. So so it's coming. And
[20:26.940 --> 20:34.380]  in terms of bacteria we got to keep that in mind. We need to start learning their names. Very hard to
[20:34.380 --> 20:41.740]  do. We need to we need to start learning a lot more about bacteria and we need to be teaching our
[20:41.740 --> 20:50.540]  children to learn bacteria stuff because it really is everything including nutrition the cannabinoids
[20:51.020 --> 20:57.340]  all the stuff that that count for us even global warming and stuff so so heavily impacted by by
[20:57.340 --> 21:03.180]  bacteria that it's really important to know. All right so having mentioned that what good does any
[21:03.180 --> 21:11.580]  of this stuff do a grower? Right I mean isn't that what we're here for? Yeah so it turns out that there
[21:11.580 --> 21:18.620]  are some mixes which people are experimenting with to try to make sure that they have the right
[21:18.620 --> 21:25.020]  bacteria in the soil for the plant to choose. And I say the plant to choose because it appears
[21:25.580 --> 21:34.860]  it appears that each different strain of cannabis has its own favorite strains of bacteria.
[21:36.540 --> 21:42.700]  Yeah go figure. So when we talk about you know terroir people are always trying to get terroir
[21:42.700 --> 21:47.100]  you know the emerald triangle wanted to say okay you grow cannabis here and it's going to taste
[21:47.100 --> 21:53.820]  like this because we've got this in our soil you know. It's really the bacteria that are giving the
[21:53.820 --> 22:00.620]  plant its taste its style etc etc. And so if you have different bacteria you have different
[22:01.660 --> 22:10.460]  impacts in the plant and and in fact it it turns out that that plants can carry bacteria for
[22:10.460 --> 22:18.620]  generations and generation generations. We know that corn seeds for example 400 year old corn seeds
[22:18.620 --> 22:25.340]  have the same bacteria as you know their progeny today have which is simply incredible to me.
[22:26.300 --> 22:32.700]  And so so you know again we're going to be getting into a situation where at some point in time
[22:32.700 --> 22:39.260]  you want to grow Durban poison here's the Durban poison mix of bacteria so that you can you can get
[22:39.260 --> 22:46.460]  your Durban poison four ways off but but but it is coming. So where do these bacteria come from when
[22:46.460 --> 22:55.500]  you're growing a cannabis plant? Okay it turns out that a lot of these bacteria get inside the plant
[22:56.060 --> 23:06.140]  move up the plant into the flower and when they're in the flower they get caught as the flower forms
[23:06.140 --> 23:12.460]  that seed so you get the bacteria the flower forms this you know process and it forms that
[23:12.460 --> 23:20.860]  seed coat around the embryo that the flower is and that seed coat contains inside it
[23:22.140 --> 23:30.220]  and the embryo itself bacteria and those are the bacteria that that plant needs. Wow! So
[23:31.180 --> 23:39.740]  when you plant that seed the bacteria leap off the growing embryo the you know the cotyledons
[23:39.740 --> 23:45.340]  etc etc and go into the soil. Well this has got to have a lot of implications for the grower
[23:45.340 --> 23:53.420]  so let's start with sterilizing seeds. No not a good idea let's let's move on to
[23:54.140 --> 24:03.020]  growing your seeds or starting your seeds in a damp paper towel it works but then you take the
[24:03.020 --> 24:09.740]  seeds and you plant them in the paper towel which has got bacteria in it you throw away no no no no
[24:09.740 --> 24:17.660]  no plant the whole thing. Pretty interesting. How about using your soil? Now I've always been a big
[24:17.660 --> 24:23.340]  proponent of reusing your soil because your plant is producing the exudates that it needs to produce
[24:23.900 --> 24:29.660]  to attract the right kinds of bacteria and fungi etc and so why would you throw that out? That's
[24:29.660 --> 24:34.540]  got you know the second time around it could be richer than the first time around particularly
[24:34.540 --> 24:39.900]  if you're using cover crops or you know you're adding compost etc so that you can continue to
[24:39.900 --> 24:45.580]  have the right nutrition. So that's pretty important. Then I begin to think about what
[24:45.580 --> 24:52.540]  about clones? Not as good. Where's the bacteria? Well there's some in the plant but you're keeping
[24:52.700 --> 24:58.940]  year after you know some people keep their clones a long time. Does it have the bacteria you really
[24:58.940 --> 25:06.380]  want? Is this why we start to have problems with clone plants that we don't get with seed plants?
[25:07.740 --> 25:15.900]  Could be. So that's another thing and again as I say there are a series of
[25:16.780 --> 25:21.820]  bacteria that you can get commercially. Most of them are what are known as bacillus
[25:22.700 --> 25:33.420]  azosipurium. I can never pronounce the damn thing. Is one of them and you can start to find these
[25:33.420 --> 25:40.860]  mixes at nurseries and good growth stores and start to experiment with them. So there's a lot
[25:40.860 --> 25:50.380]  of kind of neat things to start to fool around with and to try out. Obviously things go from
[25:50.380 --> 25:57.740]  there. For example I don't like to transplant. Why would you transplant? You know if you do
[25:57.740 --> 26:06.540]  transplant get all of the soil and make sure you get all of the bacteria. It just all becomes pretty
[26:06.540 --> 26:12.540]  logical as we go along and it's just it's fascinating. But what's even more fascinating
[26:12.540 --> 26:18.700]  is be able to look at that plant and know that all of this stuff is going on in the soil. It is
[26:19.260 --> 26:25.340]  so esoteric and exciting and when you take a look at the book there are pictures of a lot of the
[26:25.340 --> 26:35.100]  stuff. There are pictures of the bacterium inside the root cell. Wow you know. When I was a kid
[26:35.660 --> 26:40.940]  we studied bacteria in high school for about 20 seconds. They were these little black dots you
[26:40.940 --> 26:45.980]  couldn't see any. You know that's why we do amoebas and parameciums in high school because
[26:45.980 --> 26:51.180]  they're much bigger and you can see them and you can see the parts of them but you can't with a
[26:51.180 --> 26:56.620]  bacteria unless you have a really high powered microscope. So all right so as you can tell you
[26:56.620 --> 27:01.260]  can hardly shut me up and I'm going to just stop for a second let you ask me some questions if you
[27:01.260 --> 27:06.540]  have any. I definitely do. I absolutely love it and I think I've added probably about a hundred
[27:06.540 --> 27:11.580]  more. I mean I'm still stuck on the trichome and the bacteria and the fixating nitrogen and
[27:11.580 --> 27:18.860]  it affecting everything. Yeah yeah yeah bacteria and the terroir. Okay so we already know myself
[27:18.860 --> 27:23.260]  included everybody's going to want to run out and read this book. Now you do have the three other
[27:23.260 --> 27:32.140]  books. 2006 Teeming with Microbes, 2013 Teeming with Nutrients, 2017 Teeming with Fungi. What order
[27:32.140 --> 27:37.740]  should people read these in to get the best experience? Well I think you should start
[27:37.740 --> 27:45.420]  with Teeming with Microbes and then I would read the Rhizophagia next then Teeming with Fungi
[27:45.420 --> 27:52.060]  or Teeming with Fungi and then Rhizophagia and then Nutrients last. I mean and they all do
[27:52.060 --> 27:56.140]  fit together. I have to say I'm sort of amazed at myself. First of all I'm amazed at myself that I
[27:56.140 --> 28:03.740]  even wrote a book. I mean you're talking you're talking to a guy that you know write a book oh my
[28:03.740 --> 28:14.140]  god. And then not not yeah it's amazing to me but they do fit together. The the concept of
[28:14.140 --> 28:21.820]  the soil food web laid out by Dr. Elaine is so elegant and beautiful. I mean in her you know her
[28:21.900 --> 28:29.180]  usage of it and her explanations of the candies and cookie cakes and cookies as exudates and it's
[28:29.180 --> 28:34.780]  just spectacular. I mean and she's she's still obviously the you know the guru of the gurus
[28:34.780 --> 28:40.540]  uh in terms of this stuff but I think Dr. James White's contribution here is is simply incredible.
[28:40.540 --> 28:48.060]  And I wrote the book both of them because both of those individuals indicated you know this is
[28:48.060 --> 28:54.620]  what's going on. Why aren't people accepting this? I can't I can't tell you why uh but it is
[28:54.620 --> 29:02.220]  important and everybody needs to know about this stuff not just growers. It is the reason why
[29:02.220 --> 29:10.220]  organics make sense when you start using nitrogen. These bacteria we now know absolutely do not
[29:10.220 --> 29:16.220]  operate the same way. Obviously the fungi don't either. Plants are not stupid. If you're giving
[29:16.220 --> 29:22.940]  them artificial food they don't need to waste their energy producing exudates and and doing all
[29:22.940 --> 29:29.580]  the things that it has to do. And so you end up first of all with a plant that doesn't have that
[29:29.580 --> 29:36.220]  ROS situation so it doesn't get the stress development. Can't handle some of the problems
[29:36.220 --> 29:41.980]  as easily as as the stressed out plant might might be able to or can definitely do. Yeah the whole
[29:41.980 --> 29:50.540]  thing is just wow uh and it's all so logical. It fits together so beautifully uh and it's such an
[29:50.540 --> 29:59.260]  important science. Why do we not learn this in elementary school? I don't know. Right well you
[29:59.260 --> 30:03.900]  know if they came up with shorter names it would be a lot easier. Most of us are familiar with
[30:03.900 --> 30:09.100]  bacillus though. Bacillus at least we we got that one down. Yeah no you're right. I mean and and
[30:09.100 --> 30:13.500]  throughout the book I keep telling people look it don't get hung up on the names just
[30:13.500 --> 30:18.540]  blossom by. Don't even try to pronounce them. By the end of the book there are several that you
[30:18.540 --> 30:26.700]  recognize. Right. And and at some point in time it's going to be the manufacturers of these goodies
[30:26.700 --> 30:32.700]  that we want to use on our plants who who tell us what's in the ingredients. So when you go out and
[30:32.700 --> 30:40.220]  buy a mycorrhizal fungi mix now you can see what it is. I mean they list those names and you don't
[30:40.220 --> 30:47.020]  have to know those names to recognize them. Yes. You know we all know uh enterocetes is the one
[30:47.020 --> 30:51.740]  you want to have for cannabis and so you you just see that you don't have to know how to pronounce
[30:51.740 --> 30:58.140]  it and it's the same thing with these bacteria as well. It's too bad that we're you know we're all
[30:58.140 --> 31:05.500]  so stupid that we that we can't really do it but I can't. I mean I gotta tell you and and
[31:05.500 --> 31:11.500]  incidentally just as an aside these other books have been I don't know whether team with fungi
[31:11.500 --> 31:17.980]  has but teaming with nutrients and teaming with bacteria have been put into the audio uh version.
[31:18.860 --> 31:25.740]  And I don't think fungi and bacteria have because I'm not sure that the guy can pronounce all the
[31:25.740 --> 31:33.340]  words. That would be hard. I've got my set here. Ah there you go. Yes got my set here and again
[31:33.340 --> 31:38.620]  everybody too real quick I just want to let you know um links to these books are down in the show
[31:38.620 --> 31:43.820]  notes as well to Amazon. Little insider tip if you don't have any of them look for the bundle. So
[31:43.820 --> 31:48.860]  there'll probably be a four bundle soon. I hope so. I you know I asked if they were going to do
[31:48.860 --> 31:55.100]  that and the publisher has no control over over it but uh you know it would make a great deal of
[31:55.100 --> 31:58.860]  sense. In fact I think there ought to be a little a little box because I don't plan on writing
[31:58.860 --> 32:03.820]  another one but of course that's what I said after I knew that's yeah. I can't I mean I can't think
[32:03.820 --> 32:10.140]  of anything else that could possibly happen inside the soil food web. Well hey well that's the thing
[32:10.140 --> 32:15.660]  though I mean you know bacteria microorganisms all of these things you know the the old saying
[32:15.660 --> 32:22.060]  the the spoonful of soil has you know billions of things that we don't even know yet. Right. So
[32:22.700 --> 32:30.860]  I'm sure there's I'm sure there's room for it. I mean rhizophage cycle for example 2010 is is when
[32:30.860 --> 32:35.260]  it really kind of came to light and then you know Rutgers kind of took off James White took off and
[32:35.260 --> 32:41.420]  ran with it. Um let's let's kind of break that down. I like I want to um break a few of these
[32:41.420 --> 32:46.780]  things down. I'm glad that you broke uh the terminology down. Terminology is one thing that
[32:46.780 --> 32:53.100]  I'm I'm big on um especially you know coming from like the homegrown perspective. A lot of us will
[32:53.100 --> 32:59.100]  kind of be able to tell you in a sentence what we're talking about whereas some of this terminology
[32:59.100 --> 33:07.900]  sums it up in a word. Right. So um you know you said rhizo root phagy eating um and and the the
[33:07.900 --> 33:18.140]  endophyte endophytic endo inside fight plant. So which an endo endosymbiosis because what you're
[33:18.140 --> 33:24.940]  getting is a symbiotic relationship between the plant and a bacterium or a plant and a fungi uh
[33:24.940 --> 33:34.380]  inside the plant. So it's endosymbiosis uh and it produces nitrogen sometimes. Wow. Yes and
[33:34.380 --> 33:41.740]  that brings me to a point here because there there's I don't know if it's a debate or not
[33:41.740 --> 33:45.980]  but you know there there's different styles of growing and some synthetic growers and some
[33:45.980 --> 33:52.540]  organic growers and one of the common things that comes up is well the root only sees it in one form
[33:52.540 --> 33:59.500]  anyways. And while that may be true it's missing the broader picture like you were illustrating
[33:59.500 --> 34:06.380]  that it's really the bacteria that is doing a lot of this fixation a lot of the beneficial things
[34:06.380 --> 34:11.100]  for the plant. And if you're going synthetically well then there that bacteria is just not
[34:11.660 --> 34:18.220]  in the picture and you'll have a lower result typically even if it's the same amount of
[34:18.220 --> 34:25.100]  input right? I think so yeah. Okay. Uh and you know and it's sort of counterintuitive if you're if you
[34:25.100 --> 34:31.420]  if you're using the artificial you don't get as many root hairs so you're not getting as much
[34:31.420 --> 34:36.700]  nutrients. You know and again I'm I'm having trouble on this whole root hair thing I mean
[34:36.700 --> 34:40.860]  Dr. James and I have talked about it a little bit I mean you know we were always taught that root
[34:40.860 --> 34:49.740]  hairs are there to absorb nutrients. Right. Yeah I mean that they do do that but these things are
[34:49.740 --> 34:54.940]  blowing up all the time. I mean literally I've got a picture in the book it's got it's got a root
[34:54.940 --> 35:03.420]  hair and and they dye the bacteria blue the ethylene turns blue and so there are these blue explosions
[35:03.420 --> 35:09.100]  down the length of the root hair. Well how is it absorbing it must happen and I don't know this
[35:09.100 --> 35:13.180]  answer I'm gonna have to get this answer we'll have to come back on the show again. It must be
[35:13.180 --> 35:20.300]  that after the bacteria are expelled the root hair continues to live a little longer and that's
[35:20.300 --> 35:27.580]  when it absorbs nutrients. It's a good question because because when you when you look and I and
[35:27.580 --> 35:37.340]  I've seen actually seen a a couple of videos you literally get a tidal wave miniature that occurs
[35:37.340 --> 35:45.580]  inside the the root that goes out into the root tube that root hair I mean it's a wave and it's
[35:45.580 --> 35:51.820]  shockwaves yeah so it's a literal water wave or whatever the whatever the liquid contains inside
[35:51.820 --> 35:58.380]  the periplasmic liquid wave and it pushes the thing right out and it causes the pressure
[35:58.380 --> 36:05.500]  that causes the tip of the of the root hair to blow out. So yeah it's just it's crazy it's crazy
[36:05.580 --> 36:13.660]  but we digress. Okay so yes back to the rhizophasdy cycle yeah photosynthesis it's producing our
[36:13.660 --> 36:18.780]  exudates which kind of get emitted to the roots that's kind of the start of this. One question
[36:18.780 --> 36:24.780]  is with the timing of the release of the exudates a lot of times we hear it is mainly in the dark
[36:24.780 --> 36:32.140]  cycle but is it also happening during the light cycle is it photo dependent? See that's a good
[36:32.140 --> 36:39.340]  question. I don't know you know I know where it's happening it's happening down at the root
[36:39.340 --> 36:45.420]  tip right at the slough area zone there and then up a little teeny bit and we've got some
[36:45.420 --> 36:51.740]  terrific pictures again there's some in the in the in the book it does require photosynthesis
[36:53.580 --> 37:00.380]  but but you know that's a very good question. Okay because we've seen you know and I obviously
[37:00.380 --> 37:06.620]  don't have the answer which is yeah yeah but we see brix levels kind of dropping right in the
[37:06.620 --> 37:11.180]  evening or towards lights out and that's you know we kind of think sometimes of the sugars as exudates
[37:12.380 --> 37:17.420]  so I didn't know if there was a connection there. Well there is there's definitely a connection at
[37:17.420 --> 37:26.300]  nighttime I mean you that you get sugars produced but okay yeah it's a good question I'm gonna
[37:26.780 --> 37:32.380]  check. Okay and because this will help gardeners too you know debating whether they do a 24-hour
[37:32.380 --> 37:38.220]  light cycle or you know break it up into a 18-6 light cycle and that was sometimes one of the
[37:38.220 --> 37:44.700]  reasonings for it but you know so the bacterias they're kind of they're attracted to this and
[37:44.700 --> 37:51.100]  they enter into the roots. Right. Why do some enter the roots and some just hang out in the
[37:51.100 --> 37:56.860]  rhizosphere? Good question and which one came first? I mean I mean where the what was it was
[37:56.860 --> 38:02.140]  the exudate designed to attract them to go into the root and it just happens to be that there's
[38:02.140 --> 38:08.460]  a swimming pool out there that some of them decide to stay in and they get eaten or was it the
[38:08.460 --> 38:12.140]  swimming pool where they were getting eaten and then all of a sudden a couple of them went gee
[38:12.140 --> 38:19.900]  what's that nice smell it's butyric acid that the that the plant produces. Now butyric acid is is
[38:19.900 --> 38:28.380]  the smell of rancid butter and if you've got enough of it it's the smell of vomit. I know yeah
[38:28.380 --> 38:34.140]  and and so I know this because my father was in the butter business and I had to I had to go do
[38:34.140 --> 38:39.900]  it because it was a family business for six months and whoo I can smell rancid butter when when it's
[38:39.900 --> 38:45.580]  not very rancid. The the butyric acid causes
[38:47.980 --> 38:55.980]  bacteria to move in and out of bacteria slimes and so you you get you get these bacteria that
[38:55.980 --> 39:04.300]  produce a bacterial slime right on the root right at that root tip and they are they are
[39:05.100 --> 39:15.820]  they are tempted to move out of the slime into the root by butyric acid concentrations yeah.
[39:18.060 --> 39:24.460]  And you know you said when it goes into the root uh the kind of the cell walls are getting oxidized
[39:24.460 --> 39:30.300]  there uh so it's basically you know I'm picturing in my head a can't uh you know an M&M and and the
[39:30.300 --> 39:35.020]  shells melted off but you still have the chocolate. Right. What is keeping it intact
[39:35.020 --> 39:40.620]  to to finally get ejected like a pod from you know the the Death Star? Yeah it's funny they
[39:40.620 --> 39:46.460]  they form something that's known in science as an L form you know I looked like crazy what is
[39:46.460 --> 39:53.900]  L what's that L stand for? It turns out uh it was it was developed or discovered uh and described
[39:53.900 --> 40:02.380]  at a school in London so they took the L from London. Oh geez okay. You know they they they
[40:02.380 --> 40:11.500]  form this little teeny uh these quads and you and sometimes there's six six plex whatever six is is
[40:12.700 --> 40:18.940]  and and there's got to be something holding them together and and I just wonder whether it's
[40:19.740 --> 40:27.100]  you know some of their pyle or or or what uh it doesn't appear uh although they look like
[40:27.660 --> 40:31.100]  beach balls with different color you know different little things on the inside
[40:32.060 --> 40:37.420]  they got there's got to be something holding it's a little membrane but not the cell wall itself
[40:37.420 --> 40:43.660]  um so there must be a little little thin membrane holding it together uh and and as they roll around
[40:43.660 --> 40:49.660]  the irritation causes them to multiply along with time itself they're getting a little bit
[40:49.660 --> 40:56.140]  of carbohydrate from the plant so the plant is really in control it's not the bacteria that's
[40:56.140 --> 41:01.340]  in control it's the plant the plant does the circulating the plant does the tempting uh to
[41:01.340 --> 41:07.180]  bring it into the plant uh the plant does the spraying to remove the cell wall the bacteria
[41:07.180 --> 41:14.060]  does produce the ethylene and and escapes I guess uh as a result of its own ethylene but um
[41:14.940 --> 41:21.820]  it's an interesting relationship and and again once again proves that plants aren't these dumb
[41:21.820 --> 41:27.660]  sedentary uh organisms you know they're they're beyond intelligent and capable
[41:28.860 --> 41:36.540]  they've got us working for them I know that much they certainly do now when when it so it it does
[41:36.540 --> 41:43.740]  finally get ejected out kind of the root tip as it grows and enters the soil regrows the cell wall
[41:43.740 --> 41:50.300]  is this infinite or do they degrade or lose power over time like once you know a real rich
[41:50.860 --> 41:56.700]  yeah material load there yeah first of all I don't it doesn't it doesn't seem logical to me that
[41:56.700 --> 42:02.300]  all of them would get would get put back in again so some of them must remain in the soil
[42:03.260 --> 42:09.180]  but it does appear to be infinite it continues on and on and on and that's why they're being
[42:09.180 --> 42:14.620]  ejected back out into new soil you know they're not coming out just they're not just sloughing
[42:14.620 --> 42:20.380]  out of the side of the cell they they've got a root here okay he checks them out so
[42:20.380 --> 42:26.220]  so let's think Ukraine you know uh these are those these are those missile launchers uh
[42:26.220 --> 42:30.060]  it's putting those missiles out of the air and it's getting those it's getting that Russian
[42:30.060 --> 42:36.860]  soil out there and you know it's blowing up out there anyway uh I'm getting a little crazy on that
[42:36.860 --> 42:44.380]  one but uh yeah because the pictures are amazing too when you see it it's just because because you
[42:44.380 --> 42:49.980]  said it has to grow before it ejects it so as the new tip grows it's obviously hitting new soil
[42:49.980 --> 42:55.500]  right and it's kind of to replenish everything there right so if you imagine that it's coming
[42:55.500 --> 43:01.580]  out here you know and it's if it just stayed right there that would be just right there but it's it's
[43:01.580 --> 43:09.420]  there right down here and coming out in a new soil it's yeah yeah that's that's pretty cool
[43:09.420 --> 43:16.620]  definitely pretty cool yeah and you said you know the plant kind of attracts uh you know these things
[43:16.620 --> 43:22.700]  like the plants and control the destiny um I've also heard you say why you know quality of light
[43:22.700 --> 43:29.820]  is important to microbes like 50% of the photosynthesis was used for exudate creation
[43:29.820 --> 43:36.060]  yeah 40 50 sometimes some people say 60 is used to produce those exudates I mean there's you know
[43:36.060 --> 43:41.100]  you think about what they are they're sugars and amino acids and carbon you know they're
[43:41.100 --> 43:46.700]  they're complex uh and again you know going back to teaming with nutrients which which not only
[43:46.700 --> 43:51.420]  describes what how the stuff gets in but talks a little bit about what happens inside this
[43:51.420 --> 43:58.940]  holy crow I mean everything that's inside that plant cell is produced by that oh man yeah it's
[43:58.940 --> 44:05.340]  pretty incredible so what happens is when those cell walls are stripped off and and uh you know
[44:05.340 --> 44:13.660]  the the the goodies that are in that cell wall move through the periplasmic space through the
[44:13.660 --> 44:23.020]  membrane into the cytoplasm where they're then used to make new things enzymes mostly uh but but
[44:23.020 --> 44:31.340]  cell parts wow it's just neat uh and so I I suppose if the plant says god I need a couple of more uh
[44:32.140 --> 44:38.860]  you know endoplasmic I need I need more more endoplasmic reticulum wall it changes this
[44:38.860 --> 44:46.220]  exudate and exudate and brings in what it needs it's just it's in control it's mind-boggling yeah
[44:46.860 --> 44:51.900]  it is and and and when we're referring to to quality of light too is that more or less spectrum
[44:51.900 --> 44:58.380]  or is it intensity or maybe just really both I think it's both I think it's both now you know
[44:59.740 --> 45:04.940]  there have been a lot of changes in in in lights as as we've gone along I mean when I was a kid
[45:04.940 --> 45:09.100]  you could tell who was growing plants and who wasn't not necessarily that it was weed you know
[45:09.100 --> 45:14.620]  by those purple window you know there'd be this purple shine coming from these windows you knew
[45:14.620 --> 45:21.260]  it was a plant light uh and now we've got all sorts of different kinds and and man oh man uh you know
[45:21.260 --> 45:26.300]  folks that are listening to this show know so much more about it than I do I love plasma light because
[45:26.300 --> 45:32.220]  it's about as close as you can get uh they're not easy to find and they're expensive uh but boy they
[45:32.220 --> 45:40.220]  grow some terrific weed um you know but they've been a lot of advances uh some of which is due to
[45:40.220 --> 45:44.860]  NASA uh which is trying to figure out how they're going to grow plants in space and and a lot of it
[45:44.860 --> 45:49.020]  having to do with people that are are growing weed and a lot of it having to do with people
[45:49.020 --> 45:54.620]  that have decided that that vertical indoor growing is is a way to go and and so we're getting
[45:54.620 --> 46:00.860]  terrific terrific advances so I say yeah both you want intensity and spectrum you get your spectrum
[46:00.860 --> 46:06.140]  you want to get as close to the sun as possible now it may be uh that as people experiment it
[46:06.140 --> 46:11.580]  turns out that there's a better spectrum than the sun spectrum I haven't seen one but I haven't I
[46:11.580 --> 46:17.020]  haven't experimented with it either I all I know is that when I've got great plasma light I get
[46:17.020 --> 46:23.100]  great indoor weed and outdoor weed always comes out great if it's good sunny yes yes and I believe
[46:23.100 --> 46:27.180]  that those are the lights that come with the bottle of suntan lotion as well yeah complimentary
[46:27.180 --> 46:33.980]  complimentary which we don't get a lot in Alaska I gotta tell you oh my gosh no a lot of rain but
[46:33.980 --> 46:41.020]  yeah yeah I'm on the Washington coast so I feel you that's why we do auto flowers you know I mean
[46:41.020 --> 46:46.460]  because because they work so well and so quickly and another great advance in science I have to say
[46:47.500 --> 46:54.060]  we love auto flowers yeah no no one thing because again a lot of us are doing this uh
[46:54.140 --> 47:00.780]  indoors at home it's a personal medicinal garden uh we may be grown in five gallon pots I want to
[47:00.780 --> 47:07.420]  ask about you know mycorrhizae uh adding that to the roots um let's say you know I I transplant
[47:07.420 --> 47:13.580]  from my my one gallon I'll sprinkle on my mycorrhizae I'll put it in the five gallon
[47:13.580 --> 47:22.140]  is that really going to colonize and form a like tangible difference within the next 70 days
[47:22.140 --> 47:29.420]  you know it depends on well next 70 days sort of probably towards the end of that yes so what I do
[47:29.420 --> 47:38.140]  is I roll my seeds I roll my seeds in in in whatever whatever uh mycorrhizal fungi I need
[47:38.140 --> 47:43.340]  and I was same thing I would do with the rhizobia I roll my seeds in it uh and so you get both the
[47:43.340 --> 47:49.260]  bacteria from inside the seed as well as quick instant uh now I also put it out into the soil
[47:49.260 --> 47:55.420]  as well so that as roots grow into it you know they'll they'll form that relationship um obviously
[47:55.420 --> 48:02.380]  it works much better when you're talking about longer period of time uh but I think people are
[48:02.380 --> 48:07.260]  becoming cognizant and adding adding different things it used to be when you bought mycorrhizal
[48:07.260 --> 48:13.820]  fungi you bought mycorrhizal fungi now when you buy mycorrhizal fungi uh you know you you end up
[48:13.820 --> 48:21.980]  with uh different additions uh and we all have you know our own favorite uh depending on
[48:23.660 --> 48:29.980]  what's added for the mycorrhizal fungi to eat as it's getting to where it gets to be uh and some
[48:29.980 --> 48:38.140]  of that stuff also helps obviously the bacteria that are growing there as well yeah okay and um
[48:38.700 --> 48:43.900]  you know earlier we're talking a little bit about the plant membranes and I heard
[48:43.900 --> 48:49.100]  a previous interview with you where you say people need to know about membranes but they
[48:49.100 --> 48:55.180]  don't right what what is it that we're missing about membranes well membranes are what hold
[48:55.180 --> 49:00.060]  goods inside you know so that membrane around the bacteria once it doesn't have its wall is what
[49:00.060 --> 49:06.780]  doesn't have its wall is what what holds the goods inside uh the membrane is the guard and
[49:06.780 --> 49:14.220]  and uh it determines what enters into the cell and what doesn't enter into the cell um so these
[49:14.220 --> 49:19.980]  bacteria they don't get inside the cell they get inside the cell wall yeah but they don't get inside
[49:19.980 --> 49:27.820]  that cytoplasm area where all the organelles are contained and that where all of the manufacturing
[49:27.820 --> 49:35.580]  and biosynthesis occurs because they can't get through that membrane the membrane has in it
[49:36.700 --> 49:43.260]  little tunnels some of them are chemical tunnels some of them are physical tunnels uh some of them
[49:43.260 --> 49:49.180]  operate as a result of being able to pump out hydrogen ions which attach to what what you you
[49:49.180 --> 49:57.500]  want to move inside the plant uh and those tunnels are specific for what the plant needs and so if
[49:57.500 --> 50:05.900]  you're a phosphate ion you only go into one kind of tunnel and that's all that tunnel takes in uh
[50:05.900 --> 50:15.020]  these tunnels are all made by the plant cell itself which is mind-boggling to me uh so so you
[50:15.020 --> 50:23.820]  might have a you you definitely have a one for boron well so little boron is you i mean how many
[50:23.820 --> 50:29.020]  molecules are born but you gotta make that tunnel one way or the other and it's got to be in that
[50:29.020 --> 50:37.020]  membrane for that boron to get in there we don't spend enough time appreciating how incredible that
[50:37.020 --> 50:45.340]  is uh i mean there are 10 000 different kinds of enzymes at least inside a plant cell uh and
[50:45.340 --> 50:54.940]  probably a thousand to ten thousand uh uh uh examples of each one of them so wow uh there's
[50:54.940 --> 51:00.700]  so much activity going on you know we just kind of assume okay well you know stick the seed in and
[51:00.700 --> 51:07.500]  it grows and yeah wow so there's a lot of wonderment here that's the fun and fascinating
[51:07.500 --> 51:12.540]  thing about a lot of these discoveries and you said this was kind of partially brought on obviously
[51:12.540 --> 51:19.900]  curiosity and hypothesis but also by an advancement in microscope technology and and hopefully we'll
[51:19.900 --> 51:26.060]  continue to see more of those right oh no question about it i mean now we can see individual atoms
[51:26.060 --> 51:31.900]  holy crow so it's just figuring you know somebody had to sit there and think yeah they're well uh
[51:31.900 --> 51:43.100]  dr james uh has found uh literally bacteria inside the nucleus i don't know how they got in there
[51:43.100 --> 51:47.500]  you know uh but they're inside the nucleus bacteria is small enough they could probably move
[51:47.500 --> 52:00.620]  uh and so so they're probably feeding nitrogen fixing the the uh dna and the uh rna that goes out
[52:00.620 --> 52:08.620]  you know or the messenger rna that goes out the the little pores and the yeah crazy absolutely crazy
[52:10.460 --> 52:15.660]  100 so i got i have to correct myself so so bacteria can move in into a lot of these
[52:15.660 --> 52:19.340]  membranes but that's not what happens with the big ones that we've got circulating around let
[52:19.340 --> 52:25.340]  me tell you that uh it's there it's the stuff that they produce then moves through the periplasmic
[52:25.340 --> 52:35.720]  space through the plant membrane in into the cytoplasm so and um we're talking about and i
[52:35.720 --> 52:43.320]  actually did see one of the slides of the bacteria in the root tip of the seedling um some people
[52:44.200 --> 52:48.840]  you know will sterilize seeds there's a and i'm not sure if you're familiar with it the hop latent
[52:48.840 --> 52:56.120]  byroid um it's something that people are looking at or blaming for some stunting some dudding as
[52:56.120 --> 53:03.240]  time goes on um we know that mechanical transmission fluids tissues that type of stuff
[53:04.200 --> 53:09.480]  we were really trying to discover if that's coming through in seeds and so a lot of people will clean
[53:09.480 --> 53:15.560]  their seeds for that and you said no because there goes the bacteria along with it but knowing that
[53:15.560 --> 53:23.240]  the bacteria is inside of the embryo is it possible for maybe that byroid to actually travel in the
[53:23.240 --> 53:30.440]  same fashion do they work interchangeably i'm ignorant i mean i i'm probably probably so i'm
[53:30.440 --> 53:35.240]  not certain uh because i'm not really a bacteriologist i'm an attorney that just happens
[53:35.240 --> 53:42.200]  to read a lot uh and uh but but you know so there are situations there's situations when you need to
[53:42.200 --> 53:47.400]  rototill even though rototilling is bad and so if you've got a problem and you think it's seed
[53:47.400 --> 53:55.000]  caused sterilize it but then think about what's happening with the seeds that that plant is going
[53:55.000 --> 54:01.080]  to produce and i spent a little bit of time in the book talking about you know okay so we get
[54:01.080 --> 54:05.400]  the cannabis seeds you got a male plant you know you get a beautiful male plant next to your female
[54:05.400 --> 54:11.560]  plant and you get some beautiful seeds you're breeding etc etc when when do you get those seeds
[54:12.280 --> 54:17.400]  do you take them right off the plant as soon as they form do you wait till they really mature
[54:17.400 --> 54:24.200]  and fall to the ground and maybe pick up some more bacteria uh okay you know i mean i think you kind
[54:24.200 --> 54:28.920]  of kind of wait till they mature and emulate nature as much as you possibly can but yeah so
[54:28.920 --> 54:33.720]  it's there's some pretty interesting things to be thinking about and and the people that are
[54:33.720 --> 54:39.400]  listening here i don't have the answers because i'm i'm just you know i'm a 73 year old guy who
[54:39.400 --> 54:44.280]  likes to smoke weed and i grow plants because it's fun and i think about these things an awful
[54:44.280 --> 54:50.760]  lot and i experiment a little bit but you guys are the experts and so we need experimentation so we
[54:50.760 --> 54:57.480]  can figure this stuff out yes experimentation and again i love the collaborative effort
[54:57.480 --> 55:03.240]  and that collaborative effort again is aided by terminology so i am glad that you are coming here
[55:03.240 --> 55:08.040]  to again help us with some of that and help us understand some of these concepts i know
[55:08.040 --> 55:12.920]  again my mind is still stuck on the tricone like yeah yeah well well yeah but you know i mean
[55:12.920 --> 55:19.560]  collaborative that's why it's teaming teaming you know we i like that me we're it's collaborative
[55:19.560 --> 55:26.280]  with the with the microbes as well as uh uh you know so uh yeah so these are my little teaming
[55:26.280 --> 55:31.720]  hat i actually actually started to sell people are actually i saw somebody walking around with
[55:31.800 --> 55:40.520]  one the other day i went wow amazing so uh yeah collaborative is really important and it doesn't
[55:40.520 --> 55:46.120]  it doesn't take a genius it takes somebody that just knows how to observe and if there's one
[55:46.120 --> 55:53.720]  thing cannabis growers know it's how to observe what's going on yes yeah that's definitely something
[55:53.720 --> 55:59.800]  we have to do and you know as as as we're talking here i'm observing the time and you know i i asked
[55:59.800 --> 56:04.920]  for an hour we're getting close to that and i want to be respectful of your time um i still do
[56:04.920 --> 56:09.960]  have a couple more questions and sure you know everybody in chat if you can yeah hang hang out
[56:09.960 --> 56:15.720]  with us for another couple minutes sure since we are getting kind of close to the end though i want
[56:15.720 --> 56:23.160]  to ask you and this is this is like a pick your favorite like kid question um but what discovery
[56:23.160 --> 56:31.560]  excites you the most in this new book well you know this trichome stuff really excites the hell
[56:31.560 --> 56:41.080]  out of me but just the the the way the the way the rise of the way the plant controls these bacteria
[56:41.080 --> 56:49.160]  and brings them in it's just to me just neat and so i i bet i've got one spot in the book where
[56:49.160 --> 56:56.120]  because i'm never sure you know the way i write my books just so that people know i assume that
[56:56.120 --> 57:00.360]  people are like me and they don't know anything about the subject and so they don't they don't
[57:00.360 --> 57:05.800]  remember their science classes and so i spend a little bit of time laying out the science and
[57:05.800 --> 57:11.400]  it's pretty damn boring uh i try to make it a little light i try to make it as easy as possible
[57:11.400 --> 57:16.520]  but in order to understand what's going on in the second half of the book you gotta you gotta wade
[57:16.520 --> 57:26.760]  through this this stuff and and uh the way it all fits together just blows my mind it's just elegant
[57:27.480 --> 57:35.320]  elegant chemistry and biology and it's just i forgot what the question was but uh uh you know
[57:35.320 --> 57:41.400]  the favorite part is just how how how it just all comes together and so i spend time in the book
[57:41.400 --> 57:48.200]  pretending that i'm a bacterium you know and what so what what's happening where wait a minute i
[57:48.200 --> 57:55.240]  smell popcorn i smell i smell butter you know i mean and then i go and then oh wait a second uh
[57:55.240 --> 58:00.760]  you know i'm being thrown out of my root here like i've been wow what a ride you know it's just
[58:02.280 --> 58:07.320]  yeah sounds like a wild ride and same with a plant too i mean so i spend a little bit of
[58:07.320 --> 58:14.520]  time pretending i'm a plant cell what's going on you know i'm hungry it's interesting i think
[58:15.560 --> 58:20.920]  i i do as well um unfortunately all i was taught is i'm a little teapot so i've got that
[58:23.960 --> 58:30.840]  what um so is this something that we're going to be able to commercially find um like i want to add
[58:30.840 --> 58:35.400]  you know the right bacteria that's going to enter my roots it's going to am i going to be able to
[58:35.400 --> 58:42.040]  buy a bottle of this or how okay yes and and the reason is because one of you who's listening is
[58:42.040 --> 58:48.360]  going to come up with it uh you know yes you definitely are you already can buy mixes uh
[58:48.360 --> 58:56.040]  there was a wonderful study done on this as a as a perillium as a sperillium uh which is a bacillus
[58:56.040 --> 59:02.440]  uh it's from it's from brazil this particular strain but there's many different strains and
[59:02.520 --> 59:10.920]  and now that people can do research on cannabis growing which we really still can't fully do in
[59:10.920 --> 59:17.960]  the united states but they certainly can in israel and other places and soon i hope uh you know chuck
[59:17.960 --> 59:23.480]  schumer and the and the folks are gonna finally make it so that we don't have any problems doing
[59:23.480 --> 59:29.640]  this kind of research and there will be commercial mixes there's already a series of commercial mixes
[59:29.640 --> 59:35.240]  for uh mycorrhizal fungi whoever you know when i wrote the book i didn't know that was going to
[59:35.240 --> 59:40.600]  happen i knew it was going to happen but it wasn't existent then uh and the same thing's going to
[59:40.600 --> 59:48.040]  happen here same thing for sure and maybe even might even be spray uh for the for the trichome
[59:48.040 --> 59:56.840]  formation uh and and for you know and then and then drench for the uh for the roots yeah i i
[59:56.840 --> 01:00:03.000]  really can't wait to dig into the this trichome kind of discovery and again studied on cannabis
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.480]  that's a a rarity when it comes to these types of developments so right uh i know i'll have a hundred
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:14.680]  more questions after i read that okay let me let me see if i can even find uh let me see i might
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:24.380]  even have the citation of the paper here i don't know if i do uh it's funny somebody somebody's
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:30.380]  putting up chad wants to sell bacteria well that's actually kind of my i got a question for you after
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:36.620]  you find that one that kind of relates to that but uh okay so all i all i've got for citation right
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:47.420]  here is biology 2022 2022 uh comma 11 000 comma 876 and if you type that into one of those
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:56.780]  science uh search deals you might be able to find the damn thing but uh yeah i know what i'm doing
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:03.820]  later um but yeah it brings me brings me back to the that question though okay so we will eventually
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:15.980]  have a mix um microorganisms being patented uh oh my god we're we're seeing this already yes
[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:22.060]  yeah absolutely i mean a friend of mine has a uh microbe he's looking looking for an investor if
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:28.780]  anybody's interested he's got a microbe that the united states government patented that produces
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:36.540]  a gas that causes plants to go wild when i mean wild i mean grow better fruit more blah blah blah
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:43.020]  uh and and it's patented and and uh he did the research in his lab and was able to get the
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:47.340]  exclusive rights to this thing so yeah we're gonna we're gonna find things like this and you
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:53.820]  experimentally you put this into a little a little can you make a hole in it you put it underneath
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:02:00.620]  the plant and oh my god uh so so yeah there are patented stuff it's hard to believe
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:06.060]  uh and i'm not sure i like the idea uh but people will be coming up with mixes that are patented
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:12.300]  and whatnot and you can already buy this stuff the the drawback of course is how do you store things
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:18.540]  how do you put them into a form where you can ship and and they have a shelf life uh that's
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:25.580]  why bacillus is so good because bacillus forms uh you know they go into a state where they're
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:32.380]  just in suspended animation they're dormant uh and so you can ship them you can heat them you
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:37.100]  know and then boom when you want to get them going you get them going uh and so yeah we're
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:42.140]  definitely going to see them okay and and i'd love to see that mixed in with some soil blends too
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:48.460]  uh and kind of you know if you've been listening the whole time uh the the reading between the
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:53.660]  lines the longer you keep your soil the more of these occur the better soil you're going to have
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:58.700]  that's right as long as long as you make sure that you've got good nutrients still being uh you know
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.580]  you've got to have organic matter for the nutrients to be made and it takes time and so you may have
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:11.260]  to you may have to take your soil put a cover crop on it for example uh or not and and and and leave
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:16.940]  it for a couple of cycles while you grow in a different pot you know so that so that you get
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:24.300]  the nutrients back in again uh that are taken away because we violate as growers the law of return
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:30.300]  what falls from a plant is supposed to fall from a plant it goes back in and replaces the nutrients
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:35.420]  that that we take the stuff away so uh that's that's another thing you might want to think
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:42.860]  about if you're just into flowers leave the rest of the plant uh i always leave the root in the
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:50.540]  soil i never pull it out uh there's an ability for the new plant roots to travel down the same
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:59.020]  zone uh the same hole that the tunnel the old roots made uh and so you know that's got good
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:04.060]  stuff right there uh and so yeah there are all sorts of stuff you can do with that soil
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:10.940]  awesome awesome and that kind of actually segues into i got a couple questions here uh just from
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:18.300]  chad if anybody has a quick one type it in i will try to see it um let me flip my screen here and i
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:25.260]  get it up all fancy like okay take that off i'm sorry doing a doing a little technical stuff behind
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:31.420]  the scenes too okay so chad can you ask about his favorite cover crop that's low and soft
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:33.180]  low and soft
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:37.500]  chickweed chickweed
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:47.500]  i use chickweed on my tomatoes um i i've i've used it on on my auto flowering cannabis uh
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:53.180]  and it works great as long as you pay attention and pull it down because it has a tendency to grow
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:59.740]  in uh but yeah it actually fixes nitrogen uh obviously white clover does as well
[01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:04.620]  there's a little yellow clover little red clover that i that i find that grows in my
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:10.940]  my plants down in portland uh and i use i use some of those seeds uh whenever i pull those clumps up
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:15.980]  they got little clumps of soil right there you know i know they're producing all sorts of great
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:25.020]  rhizobia uh so uh and purslane uh is that anything that you've used yourself or i i haven't used it
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:32.620]  myself uh uh i know it works i've used broad bean for bigger plants uh that works well
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:40.700]  okay and let's see here another question and and to be completely fair um i don't even know if this
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:45.660]  is an area that you are familiar with and you know sometimes people in chat you're like gosh
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:52.620]  jeff is so smart he's gonna know everything yeah but how come i'm not really familiar with
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:06:00.140]  but how come i'm not rich yeah i'll ask the question for you though because i'm even a
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:06.060]  little confused about it myself but let's see here can you ask about capturing cannibal dial
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:13.180]  cannibal die like acid in an fpj so a ferment uh it's found in cannabis leaves and it's a
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:22.300]  precursor to delta 9 thc i believe um so have you actually worked on isolating no okay no okay uh
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:30.540]  you know other than inhaling and having my body uh no i haven't um and i don't i have no idea how
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:37.420]  you would even apply that yeah i'm you know again i i'd like to get the questions up there not and
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:42.700]  that's why sometimes i give the preface i'm not sure if this is it doesn't make sense to me maybe
[01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:48.700]  it will to you um okay well it's not that it doesn't make sense it's just that i'm not familiar
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:55.980]  yeah well correct yes yes i know to someone it might uh so thank you dennis for that sorry for
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:02.780]  just stumbling along with that one um okay another question here do you know of a bacteria please
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:08.460]  that could possibly assist in the elemental release of boron from a rock with high levels
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:17.580]  such as shale i'm not sure it would be a bacteria or fungi uh i mean to me when i think when i think
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:23.900]  about breaking down rocks i think fungi i don't think i don't think bacteria um yeah
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:30.460]  so so i would get some i would get some soil from wherever that rock is found
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.940]  uh and use that soil because it probably got the right fungi already in it
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:41.180]  yeah okay cool glissa hollick is still listening that was the first first question he says great
[01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:48.620]  thanks so i appreciate that and it's fun you know i'm not sure if you have chat uh up or available
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:56.380]  yeah yeah yeah it's hard on a phone fun conversation though uh and everybody definitely
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:03.260]  there's a chat button right there and here's a here's a soil spirits the the previous question
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:12.460]  about the fungi thank you jeff perfect so that worked um so we've got that in there and let's
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:19.020]  see here have you have or could you cover reproducing bacillus subtilis or various
[01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:27.020]  bacillus strains i'm interested in making my own yeah you probably can sure okay yeah will there
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:32.780]  be a way that we can reproduce these at home then like say you know we get our little colonization
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:39.980]  we get the the spoonful and then we put it can we actually farm it ourselves to well you can
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:45.980]  certainly grow it in a petri dish right okay you know that's how people normally do it um but but
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:53.340]  not not not knowing the process right off hand google it i'm certain you can do it and i'm
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:59.100]  certain that if you've got good soil uh that's got it in it already uh you keep it alive by
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:04.540]  continuing to grow stuff in it but google google it you know i always tell people i write i write a
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:11.420]  garden column uh and i i'm america's longest running garden columnist and i get more questions
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:16.700]  from people and what do i do when i get a question the first thing i do is i look it up in google
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:26.940]  google is google is the grower's best friend knowing how to do research though is uh it's
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:33.420]  almost kind of a gift like i uh went back to school later in life after doing what i had done
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:37.820]  for a long time i did a sustainable agriculture program but the one thing it really taught me
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:43.980]  above everything was actually how to research that was something i was missing in my life and that's
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:49.980]  so important well that's right i mean and so what you'll find if you look up uh how to how to how to
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:57.020]  grow bacteria you know they're going to talk about the sterile environment or they may talk
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:04.780]  about a particular plant that keeps that particular bacteria fed uh you know it's but it's out there
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:11.020]  i'm certain and i think you can find it pretty easy yeah it's fun stuff cool i want to uh
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:20.220]  you know maybe ask one more one more one more one more um we're talking about how the bacteria
[01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:27.260]  has an effect on the trichomes uh terpenes flavonoids we've been able to isolate cannabinoids
[01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:31.180]  we've been able to isolate different terpenes uh you don't even need to get cannabis derived
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:39.100]  terpenes to do this have we studied the direct effect with the bacteria and an isolate to
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:44.700]  just see what happens there or is that even something that would be of interest
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:52.780]  well you know it's all of interest uh i i haven't studied it uh but i suspect those those uh uh
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:11:01.020]  those are made by bacteria i would suspect um even though they're not plant in in nature
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:07.660]  they're not made in the plant um interesting question okay well thank you thank you um
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:13.500]  yeah because i know uh like dr ethan russo is another person that i like to follow his work
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:19.580]  on terpenes um so uh maybe i will look into that one i'll do a little bit of research on that
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:25.740]  yeah you know and i i wish i had a better citation for this stupid not stupid article it's like a
[01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:31.580]  fabulous article and i just can't find the darn thing i had it here and uh i might i might have
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:36.140]  to send it to you and then you can post it maybe or something to that sure yeah uh because i think
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:43.340]  people want to read about it i mean i you know i always tell people i don't i i'm not responsible
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:50.300]  for this stuff i don't i don't do the research uh that that comes up with these things dr elaine
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:56.780]  ingham does it dr james white does it their students do it i'm just a reporter and and so
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:03.340]  so uh you know it's it's really interesting to be able to find these papers that some of these folks
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:10.300]  participate in and and uh and learn from them because they really are the experts yes and i
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:14.780]  always want to make that i always want to make that clear i you know dr james white's the expert
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:22.140]  in rhizophagia not me uh i just happen to read his stuff an awful lot uh and and uh you know
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:26.460]  try to make it a little bit more accessible than it might be although it's pretty damn accessible
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:32.220]  yeah well and again too as i mentioned kind of top of the show is i appreciate and resonate with
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:37.900]  your delivery so i think that's a lot of people do as well uh it's you know the accessibility the
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:43.420]  ability to see it in practical application uh so important for retention i think and you know
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:49.900]  where that comes from that comes from the fact that i'm an attorney so i have to write for stupid
[01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:57.420]  judges and you gotta make it as simple as possible so that they get it yeah that's how it works
[01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:03.260]  yeah and and uh i guess not so much of a question just an observation you were talking about the
[01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:09.420]  importance of bacteria in you know the new seedlings uh to people out there talking about
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:16.780]  seed sprout tea i'm going to kind of draw that connection there of why that's beneficial in many
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:22.620]  instances is we're getting that bacteria again sometimes you do things you don't know why it works
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:28.300]  you just kind of know that it does exactly exactly and sometimes you can't really prove
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:35.180]  prove it in a explainable fashion but you can see it uh which is really quite something
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:42.060]  really quite something uh well uh you know you you've got a a great show here that's for sure
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:46.780]  uh and i'm happy to come back after the book comes out maybe people read it and
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:52.300]  have some questions and you know we can we can tie it all together in a in a different fashion
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:58.060]  it is worth i think people getting again not because i wrote it uh like all like like the
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:05.820]  2016 with micro books you know book it was you know it was dr elaine and other people not me
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:11.820]  uh but but we got to know this stuff this is this is how plants operate uh and they don't
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:18.700]  operate based on chemicals uh that's why that's why you know we need to know this stuff so that we can
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:26.780]  uh correct the problems that we have created by this awful awful fertilizer uh paradigm you know
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:33.420]  that we've got it's just terrible uh and knowing rhizophagia and the soil food web and and whatnot
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:40.540]  is is really key to all of that stuff perfect again i want to let everybody know in the show
