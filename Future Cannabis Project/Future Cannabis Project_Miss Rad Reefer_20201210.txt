[00:00.000 --> 00:04.840]  We are going live as people frantically search for lighters.
[00:04.840 --> 00:06.520]  So welcome everyone.
[00:06.520 --> 00:09.040]  Thursday morning in Los Angeles.
[00:09.040 --> 00:11.560]  It's 10.02am.
[00:11.560 --> 00:14.400]  Sorry for the two minute delay.
[00:14.400 --> 00:22.520]  We're joined today by Miss Rad Reifer and we have a, here's our Motley crew in the Brady
[00:22.520 --> 00:24.000]  Bunch windowing.
[00:24.000 --> 00:27.120]  Happy Thursday, everybody.
[00:27.120 --> 00:28.120]  Morning, sunshines.
[00:28.120 --> 00:31.360]  Morning to you, Layton, as well, buddy.
[00:31.360 --> 00:32.360]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:32.360 --> 00:33.360]  Morning, Brock.
[00:33.360 --> 00:34.360]  Glad to see you again, brother.
[00:34.360 --> 00:40.480]  Yeah, we had a week off, Michelle, and then we came back and did a fundraiser for Duke.
[00:40.480 --> 00:44.480]  So we're back at it with these longer interviews.
[00:44.480 --> 00:45.480]  Fuck yeah.
[00:45.480 --> 00:46.720]  Hell yeah.
[00:46.720 --> 00:48.840]  So how did the fundraiser go last week?
[00:48.840 --> 00:51.120]  It went really well.
[00:51.120 --> 00:54.840]  On the back end, we realized that we need to make sure everybody puts the correct address
[00:54.840 --> 00:55.840]  and stuff in.
[00:56.560 --> 00:58.800]  But we double checked everything, triple checked everything.
[00:58.800 --> 01:02.760]  But yeah, everything now went smoothly.
[01:02.760 --> 01:03.760]  Good.
[01:03.760 --> 01:05.520]  Super good to hear.
[01:05.520 --> 01:09.840]  So I wanted to, again, hats off to you, Peter, for, if you're doing that on a weekly basis,
[01:09.840 --> 01:12.440]  so that is pretty epic.
[01:12.440 --> 01:14.840]  John, thanks to all of you.
[01:14.840 --> 01:15.840]  Welcome to my world.
[01:15.840 --> 01:22.000]  Yeah, shout out to, especially to Nerds Genetics and Land O'Stink.
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.760]  They really came through in a big way and brought some really unique genetics that nobody
[01:27.760 --> 01:30.600]  else, as far as I know, nobody else has.
[01:30.600 --> 01:32.960]  So really appreciate that, guys.
[01:32.960 --> 01:34.040]  Yeah.
[01:34.040 --> 01:37.480]  So excuse me, what was the fundraiser for?
[01:37.480 --> 01:40.600]  I saw it, refresh my memory.
[01:40.600 --> 01:46.680]  Duke, our buddy Duke Diamond got hemmed up in Missouri on some, it was on some state
[01:46.680 --> 01:51.160]  charges and then those, you know, he beat those state charges.
[01:51.320 --> 01:54.760]  He was about to walk and the feds picked him up.
[01:54.760 --> 02:01.040]  So he got a fed charge and now he's, but he's almost to the end of this little marathon.
[02:01.040 --> 02:05.600]  So that's why we wanted to, you know, bring light to it and let people know that, you
[02:05.600 --> 02:06.600]  know, he's doing well.
[02:06.600 --> 02:10.840]  Some of those rumors aren't true and he's going to be out very soon.
[02:10.840 --> 02:12.160]  Good, good, good.
[02:12.160 --> 02:13.640]  Sending good vibes, right?
[02:13.640 --> 02:14.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:14.640 --> 02:18.320]  I feel like that's one of the things that I've been telling people all week on my Instagram
[02:18.480 --> 02:21.680]  about your, you know, your personality and everything is just so laid back.
[02:21.680 --> 02:24.960]  I feel like that is why you're probably so popular on Instagram.
[02:24.960 --> 02:26.400]  It seems kind of infectious.
[02:26.400 --> 02:29.360]  People, I don't see people really talking shit on your page.
[02:29.360 --> 02:34.680]  I don't see the drama that is usually kind of comes with Instagram and that kind of stuff.
[02:34.680 --> 02:38.640]  So I wanted to give, you know, hats off to you that I feel like, you know, your energy
[02:38.640 --> 02:42.640]  on a daily basis, you know, you're constantly putting out content and all that kind of stuff.
[02:42.640 --> 02:47.680]  And it's, as far as I can tell, I don't really see anybody's hating on it or hating on you.
[02:47.680 --> 02:55.000]  So hats off to you for creating a tribe that everybody is just seems like smokes weed and
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.400]  enjoys hanging out with you on Instagram.
[02:57.400 --> 03:04.080]  I mean, I'm super fortunate to have had the opportunity to cultivate the tribe that I've
[03:04.080 --> 03:10.840]  created over the years and, you know, but mind you, you know, there's some fucking haters
[03:10.840 --> 03:13.480]  out there, but that's okay.
[03:13.480 --> 03:16.080]  That kind of comes with the territory, right?
[03:16.080 --> 03:17.080]  Yeah.
[03:17.080 --> 03:21.360]  I mean, but for the most, that's what I mean, though, for the most part, your stuff is all
[03:21.360 --> 03:25.360]  love, a lot of positive vibes, just having fun in the garden.
[03:25.360 --> 03:28.400]  And that's what a lot of people, I think, especially that aren't able to cultivate,
[03:28.400 --> 03:30.240]  that's what they really want to see.
[03:30.240 --> 03:34.240]  All that behind the scenes stuff that goes on between everybody in the industry.
[03:34.240 --> 03:37.240]  I feel like at the end of the day, nobody really wants to hear about that.
[03:37.240 --> 03:43.360]  It's just show us what you're doing in the garden and do it with a smile on your face.
[03:43.360 --> 03:44.360]  Right.
[03:44.640 --> 03:49.920]  I feel like big time, a lot of people who are fortunate enough to be able to cultivate
[03:49.920 --> 03:57.640]  and even cultivate on any kind of scale, essentially kind of have a responsibility
[03:57.640 --> 04:05.800]  almost to maybe show the way or show that others can do it as well.
[04:05.800 --> 04:10.680]  Or if I can fucking do it, you sure as fuck can do it type of mentality.
[04:11.000 --> 04:19.320]  At the end of the day, it's like there's just so many different ways to cultivate the plant.
[04:19.320 --> 04:28.000]  And a lot of ways are pretty bro sciencey, but it's cool to see over the last few years,
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.800]  the last decade or so, especially with new states coming online to all of the different
[04:33.800 --> 04:38.400]  methodologies everybody's kind of taking in respects to cultivating this plant.
[04:38.440 --> 04:43.160]  There's so many ways to beat a horse with a stick.
[04:43.160 --> 04:49.480]  You're getting high today, Michelle, I promise you that.
[04:49.480 --> 04:56.320]  I love that post you made about quit whining, quit bitching, quit crying, quit complaining.
[04:56.320 --> 04:57.320]  Just fucking do it.
[04:57.320 --> 04:58.840]  Just do it.
[04:58.840 --> 05:00.840]  Get over it and get it done.
[05:00.840 --> 05:01.960]  I know.
[05:02.000 --> 05:10.640]  It's so funny too, because sometimes motivation is something I feel like so many people think
[05:10.640 --> 05:15.160]  that it's a question I get a lot, like, how are you so motivated?
[05:15.160 --> 05:17.200]  How do you keep on keeping on?
[05:17.200 --> 05:20.200]  And I mean, really, it comes down to your mindset.
[05:20.200 --> 05:25.840]  It's all a mindset game, because I can't fucking tell you how many times I would wake up in
[05:25.840 --> 05:30.920]  the morning and I really have to remind myself about all the things that I'm grateful for
[05:30.920 --> 05:38.440]  and fortunate for, because who wants to spend the next nine hours plucking fucking leaves?
[05:38.440 --> 05:39.440]  We love it, right?
[05:39.440 --> 05:43.080]  We love it when it's our garden.
[05:43.080 --> 05:46.120]  Yeah, otherwise, hell no.
[05:46.120 --> 05:47.920]  Big time.
[05:47.920 --> 05:51.640]  There's a lot of times when it's like...
[05:51.640 --> 05:59.280]  So in the last year or so, I've been really kind of diving deep into self, learning myself
[05:59.360 --> 06:05.560]  a little better, and I feel like I've almost come to a little bit of an epiphany as far
[06:05.560 --> 06:10.400]  as the quote unquote ego and then yourself.
[06:10.400 --> 06:16.400]  And it's like the ego's wanting to tell you, oh, I don't really feel like doing the things,
[06:16.400 --> 06:18.680]  but nobody gives a fuck, right?
[06:18.680 --> 06:20.600]  No one cares about your feelings.
[06:20.600 --> 06:26.960]  So we have to take that into consideration and not to really identify with that part
[06:27.040 --> 06:34.040]  of your mind that just wants to chill and smoke and Santa Cruz cannabis company's in the house.
[06:34.040 --> 06:43.080]  So, but yeah, so for me, my biggest game changer as far as the motivation aspect is kind of
[06:43.080 --> 06:49.960]  just acknowledging that not every day will I wake up wanting to feel like I want to do
[06:49.960 --> 06:50.960]  the things.
[06:51.720 --> 06:58.760]  Because of that, it's helped me immensely in just going and getting the shit done, right?
[06:58.760 --> 06:59.760]  Just get it the fuck done.
[06:59.760 --> 07:02.280]  Can we dive deeper into that, Michelle?
[07:02.280 --> 07:06.160]  I know a lot of people that talk about, oh, I love growing cannabis because I wake up
[07:06.160 --> 07:08.000]  at 10, 11 o'clock.
[07:08.000 --> 07:09.800]  For a lot of us, that's the exact opposite.
[07:09.800 --> 07:13.400]  We're waking up at five, four o'clock in the morning to do that.
[07:13.400 --> 07:16.240]  So let's go into more of like a little bit of your routine.
[07:16.240 --> 07:19.160]  I know there's a lot of newer farmers that are watching today.
[07:19.200 --> 07:22.240]  Kind of going on your work ethic and why you are so successful.
[07:23.240 --> 07:27.800]  Well, I mean, what doesn't get planned won't get measured.
[07:28.240 --> 07:35.680]  So especially if you're trying to be, I find trying to be successful in the perpetual game
[07:36.040 --> 07:39.480]  where as soon as you're harvesting, you've already got plants ready to put in.
[07:39.480 --> 07:46.400]  You really have to have a good idea on what needs to be done before it needs to be done.
[07:46.440 --> 07:55.720]  So versus like the 10 or 11 o'clock grower who grows from his couch or her couch, we
[07:55.880 --> 08:04.760]  were able to be more successful if we actually utilize the hours given to us in the day
[08:04.760 --> 08:06.720]  because everybody's got the same amount of hours.
[08:06.720 --> 08:07.480]  You know what I'm saying?
[08:07.680 --> 08:14.240]  And being busy does not reflect on actual productivity.
[08:14.240 --> 08:22.200]  So mindfulness about what needs to be done, like the night before my next, like last
[08:22.200 --> 08:27.520]  night, like a week ago, I knew I needed to get all of these things done so I could have
[08:27.520 --> 08:30.240]  like Thursday morning to kick it and wake and bake with you guys.
[08:30.240 --> 08:35.880]  Right. So I think my biggest tip would be to make sure you kind of have like a really
[08:35.880 --> 08:43.880]  good schedule set aside, especially, especially because they're plants and plants
[08:43.880 --> 08:48.080]  don't stop growing. They give fuck all about what you have going on in your life.
[08:48.320 --> 08:49.760]  They're just going to keep growing.
[08:49.760 --> 08:58.520]  And it's super the faster that you realize that like a crop out the gate that does
[08:58.520 --> 09:00.320]  really well and does well the whole time.
[09:00.320 --> 09:06.280]  You know, we consider like an A plus crop and anytime something happens, depending on
[09:06.280 --> 09:11.880]  whether or not they can bounce back, your A plus crop goes to a B minus crop to a C
[09:12.320 --> 09:16.800]  minus crop. And, you know, sometimes we change the environmentals and parameters and get
[09:16.800 --> 09:18.200]  it back up into a better.
[09:19.120 --> 09:25.720]  But, you know, you're never going to recover from some stuff that that happened if you
[09:25.720 --> 09:27.640]  weren't like diligent to begin with.
[09:28.800 --> 09:37.080]  If if you weren't really aware of what, you know, I think I just got a stoner moment and
[09:37.080 --> 09:38.360]  started losing my train of thought.
[09:38.360 --> 09:45.200]  But yeah, you just really want to make sure that you're diligent the whole time because
[09:45.200 --> 09:51.240]  you have nine weeks from like flower day one to make sure we're hitting all of our
[09:51.240 --> 09:52.280]  marks. Right.
[09:53.120 --> 09:58.520]  Some of these things would be like making sure your lower canopy is taken care of
[09:58.520 --> 10:02.320]  before the stretch, because I generally.
[10:03.320 --> 10:09.040]  Something that I like to talk about with my fellow growers, I do a little bit of
[10:09.040 --> 10:16.360]  mentoring here on the side, but I kind of treat cannabis as a flowering trimester, like,
[10:16.360 --> 10:18.000]  oh, here's more school stuff, right.
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.480]  But a trimester or pregnancy, we the first three weeks we're stretching the second three
[10:24.480 --> 10:27.400]  weeks we're stacking our flower sites.
[10:27.400 --> 10:31.320]  And then that last three weeks, you're not going to gain any more.
[10:31.320 --> 10:37.040]  You're just going to stack and bulk which flower node sites you've built in the middle
[10:37.040 --> 10:38.720]  of your trimester.
[10:38.720 --> 10:46.000]  So if you're not deleting in a timely fashion, if you're not lollipopping or stripping the
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.400]  lowers before you hit the second trimester, like you're literally wasting energy.
[10:52.240 --> 10:58.560]  My biggest example is like the little lower popcorn shit down below, like if it's not
[10:58.560 --> 11:04.520]  taken care of before flower or if you're not cutting clones off of it, then it doesn't
[11:04.520 --> 11:09.080]  belong because all they're going to do is like stretch like maybe four inches.
[11:09.080 --> 11:11.720]  Right. And then you strip it off anyway.
[11:11.720 --> 11:16.800]  So why did we spend all that energy letting it grow to four inches just to kill it off
[11:16.800 --> 11:19.520]  at like day 21? So I like to get rid of it early.
[11:20.040 --> 11:24.960]  I like to be, I like to be intent.
[11:24.960 --> 11:32.920]  I like to have intent with where I allow plants to develop their flower sites, their buds.
[11:32.920 --> 11:40.800]  So as far as like motivation and the five and six AM grower, the five and six AM grower
[11:40.800 --> 11:48.360]  knows that as soon as those tarps come off, you have an X amount of time to do your foliar
[11:48.360 --> 11:50.800]  spray before their day gets too hot.
[11:51.560 --> 11:57.560]  You want to make sure that you have water in your plants like versus like a 12 o'clock
[11:57.560 --> 12:02.440]  in the afternoon water session when they've been wanting water for hours.
[12:02.440 --> 12:08.360]  You know, so that's not to say, though, that the 10, 11 o'clock growers weren't up until
[12:08.360 --> 12:09.400]  6 a.m.
[12:09.400 --> 12:13.920]  You know, so like I said, there's like so many different ways to handle it all.
[12:13.920 --> 12:19.080]  Right. I feel like I talked way too much just now.
[12:20.880 --> 12:22.240]  No, this is what this is for.
[12:23.200 --> 12:27.920]  Like I was telling you right before we came on live, you're everywhere on Instagram, but
[12:27.920 --> 12:30.600]  yet outside of there, you're an extremely private person.
[12:30.600 --> 12:36.800]  So it's exciting to find out more about what makes you kind of successful.
[12:36.800 --> 12:41.520]  And I know it's like with the strawberry banana and that kind of stuff.
[12:41.800 --> 12:43.240]  Was that some of the stuff you were growing?
[12:43.360 --> 12:46.040]  I saw you put up a greenhouse grow on you.
[12:46.080 --> 12:48.240]  You have one video on your YouTube channel.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.440]  So could you talk about some of the genetics that you feel were successful, some of the
[12:54.440 --> 12:57.760]  things that you felt like maybe really aren't worth the time?
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.520]  I know that's really appreciative of our audience.
[13:01.640 --> 13:03.520]  Growing genetics that are kind of worthless.
[13:04.120 --> 13:05.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[13:06.680 --> 13:10.760]  I think my first thoughts on worthless genetics is anything that isn't stable.
[13:11.640 --> 13:19.000]  There aren't very many things that because weed is always like super favorable, no
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.760]  matter if it, you know, even if you didn't yield a whole lot, you may never grow it
[13:23.760 --> 13:26.520]  again, but you're still going to enjoy what you harvested.
[13:26.520 --> 13:29.320]  But stability, like don't.
[13:30.800 --> 13:36.560]  Biggest no, no, we don't pop seeds that are bag seed, even if you want the genetics,
[13:36.760 --> 13:44.400]  because there's like a huge likelihood of, you know, those seeds not being stable and
[13:44.400 --> 13:49.120]  you'll end up with more bag seeds than the one that you got out of the eight that you
[13:49.120 --> 13:50.400]  found in a dispensary.
[13:50.400 --> 13:51.160]  Right. So.
[13:55.880 --> 13:58.240]  I want to say, yo, what do you got?
[13:58.280 --> 14:00.520]  Well, me ask you a question.
[14:00.520 --> 14:04.480]  What are your top three strains in Colorado out there, though?
[14:04.480 --> 14:07.640]  Like, are y'all still growing blue dream?
[14:09.800 --> 14:14.280]  Well, I mean, in fairness, probably where the, you know, the super touristy places are,
[14:14.280 --> 14:17.160]  it seems like the Golden Goat, Blue Dreams and stuff is still up there.
[14:17.160 --> 14:21.880]  But down here in Denver and the surrounding cities, I think you would kind of get laughed
[14:21.880 --> 14:23.200]  at if you're still rocking that.
[14:26.360 --> 14:30.520]  But no, there's not a lot of, you know, I hope we don't offend a lot of people, but
[14:30.560 --> 14:35.680]  there's not a lot of good genetics that we found outside of like the kind of underground.
[14:35.760 --> 14:41.840]  It's still, you know, a handshake market for the super good genetics unless you're willing
[14:41.840 --> 14:44.320]  to go to the expos and, you know, hunt yourself.
[14:44.440 --> 14:50.600]  Right. But a lot of dispensary genetics, in my opinion, are pretty watered down from what
[14:50.600 --> 14:51.600]  they're claiming they are.
[14:52.760 --> 15:00.360]  And are you guys so you guys can't really some of the dispensaries, they're not able
[15:00.360 --> 15:05.520]  to get seeds from traditional market breeders.
[15:05.840 --> 15:10.840]  Right. You guys already have to have them from a licensed nursery to be able to produce
[15:10.840 --> 15:13.120]  them out there in the license spots.
[15:13.680 --> 15:18.200]  As far as I understand the way it still works, it has to be within that metric system.
[15:18.280 --> 15:22.200]  So as long as those seeds are in that metric system, then you can work with that.
[15:22.200 --> 15:28.880]  But let's face it, all the genetics that are fun to play with, or at least the ones I like.
[15:29.280 --> 15:31.520]  I feel like a lot of people like that's not in there.
[15:33.080 --> 15:45.280]  Yeah, I mean, well, so that's why I also feel like it's super important the platforms that
[15:45.280 --> 15:50.880]  we have now to kind of play with other people, play with other people outside of our
[15:50.880 --> 15:57.640]  industry, because some of that like Instagram recently, they kind of lifted their shadow
[15:57.640 --> 16:02.920]  ban that they had on cannabis and all cannabis accounts for like maybe the last two
[16:02.920 --> 16:08.720]  years. And during that time, there were a lot of pop ups that that were like, oh, come to
[16:08.720 --> 16:09.960]  our platform.
[16:10.040 --> 16:12.520]  We're weed friendly, etc.
[16:12.520 --> 16:17.720]  But it's like you don't really want to preach to the choir, you know, like you're trying
[16:17.720 --> 16:22.280]  to get a new audience and in front of people who aren't familiar.
[16:22.960 --> 16:26.840]  So recently, Instagram, they let us play in the sandbox again.
[16:26.840 --> 16:35.600]  So it's like super important, I think, because that's where everybody gets their seeds from.
[16:35.600 --> 16:43.240]  Like, well, it's super important to network and let everybody who doesn't know that you
[16:43.240 --> 16:46.920]  can because so many people I get a lot of, for example, I get a lot of DMs that are like,
[16:46.920 --> 16:48.280]  hey, where can I get seeds?
[16:48.600 --> 16:54.440]  And, you know, pre like 10 years ago, your your seed options were like in the back of a
[16:54.440 --> 17:01.040]  High Times magazine, like cover with some fucking seed bank in Europe that you're hoping
[17:01.040 --> 17:02.080]  that customs does.
[17:02.080 --> 17:06.280]  And it's like, no, you have like so many good breeders here.
[17:06.280 --> 17:11.240]  And the only way that these people are allowed to, you know, branch out and etc.
[17:11.240 --> 17:16.880]  is is if these social media channels let them or put put them in front of audiences that
[17:17.440 --> 17:23.040]  not not too long ago, 18 months ago, like everybody was steady growing and the community
[17:23.040 --> 17:24.320]  was, you know.
[17:24.800 --> 17:33.760]  So I think it's really important that we help get the word out because a lot of states are
[17:33.760 --> 17:34.920]  coming online right now.
[17:35.240 --> 17:40.800]  So that's so many other fucking people trying to get their foot in or their hands on to
[17:40.800 --> 17:42.080]  growing the strains.
[17:42.080 --> 17:49.760]  And I think if we left it to magazine, not that there aren't good seed companies, not to
[17:49.760 --> 17:57.400]  offend anybody who's like posting in magazines, but that audience just isn't like the
[17:57.400 --> 18:01.040]  kind of audience that's like right now on YouTube with everybody here.
[18:01.040 --> 18:06.480]  You know what I'm saying? So it's almost like another responsibility of ours to guide the
[18:06.560 --> 18:13.040]  next generation of growers where to source instead of letting them get some waste of time
[18:13.040 --> 18:18.080]  genetics, some fucking cheese F1s from the UK or whatever.
[18:19.840 --> 18:27.160]  So, yeah, that's to kind of like loop that whole tangent back around some genetics that you
[18:27.160 --> 18:28.200]  want to pay attention to.
[18:28.200 --> 18:33.800]  Some of the breeders, Cole Classics is a really he's mildly underground.
[18:33.800 --> 18:42.000]  He's the guy who was responsible for the Tony Clifton, the Cement Shoes, OGKB.
[18:42.040 --> 18:43.520]  Oh, yeah. You guys are Colorado.
[18:43.520 --> 18:48.840]  So the last High Times Cup we had out there, 2015, 2016.
[18:51.520 --> 18:54.520]  I was there. I was at your guys's last High Times Cup.
[18:54.520 --> 18:56.840]  Did you guys did any of you guys go to that one?
[18:57.840 --> 18:58.520]  No, I didn't.
[18:58.520 --> 19:02.600]  The last time High Times was a world or a US Cup in Denver.
[19:02.880 --> 19:04.000]  Oh, yeah, I did go to that one.
[19:04.560 --> 19:04.920]  Yeah.
[19:07.080 --> 19:10.120]  The other one was somebody shot at somebody and then everybody freaked out.
[19:11.520 --> 19:13.400]  I don't think so.
[19:14.560 --> 19:17.680]  That happened in Denver and then they didn't want any more weed.
[19:17.680 --> 19:19.280]  No, that was at the park.
[19:19.800 --> 19:20.240]  Yeah.
[19:22.120 --> 19:26.160]  So what are some of those genetics that you feel like, if you don't mind, like some of the
[19:26.160 --> 19:27.320]  ones tried and true?
[19:27.480 --> 19:37.320]  So so some of the ones that OK, really, Canerado, Canerado, his genetics, he's
[19:37.320 --> 19:41.000]  Colorado based, so you're pretty familiar with him, I'm sure.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.400]  But anything of his is phenomenal.
[19:44.200 --> 19:51.000]  Right now, a round ago, I was running the fat cell, which is GMO and legends OG cross.
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.560]  But that's a really good one.
[19:52.560 --> 19:55.120]  I was also running the Margie, the frozen margarita line.
[19:55.120 --> 20:04.880]  So I think 2017, he released his testers and it's really cool to see like 2017 testers
[20:04.880 --> 20:13.200]  hit the 2020 like market where I buy like a tray of clones and it's like a keeper Fino
[20:13.200 --> 20:16.400]  of some tests from a couple of seasons back, you know, so.
[20:16.400 --> 20:23.760]  Really, Canerado's got some phenomenal genetics, seed junkie, super good, a compound
[20:23.760 --> 20:27.280]  compound's another really fucking good seed company.
[20:27.280 --> 20:34.640]  Let me think for a minute because there's so many, you know what I'm saying?
[20:34.640 --> 20:41.680]  So I think honestly, one of the things that I'm really excited about is the seed junkie
[20:41.760 --> 20:44.320]  because there's so many, you know what I'm saying?
[20:44.320 --> 20:48.080]  So I think honestly, one of the ways that I kind of.
[20:50.560 --> 20:58.240]  So I didn't even escalate intentionally like Instagram and the following and everything
[20:58.240 --> 21:05.520]  that kind of just happened over the last few years as far as Instagram had anything to
[21:05.520 --> 21:06.000]  do with.
[21:06.320 --> 21:14.080]  I mean, it really led to a lot of cool opportunities and it opened some Instagram, just being able
[21:14.080 --> 21:20.240]  to share my journey on the IG and everybody being like super supportive of what I was
[21:20.240 --> 21:23.120]  trying to do or the things that I was trying to show.
[21:23.120 --> 21:29.600]  Because, you know, if nobody shows up to the things that you put out, then you're not as
[21:29.600 --> 21:30.640]  encouraged to.
[21:30.640 --> 21:35.040]  So, so super important to keep supporting, you know, your small producers.
[21:35.680 --> 21:37.600]  But anyway, it wasn't intentional.
[21:37.600 --> 21:41.280]  It literally was like, and you know, too, because you're in LA.
[21:41.280 --> 21:48.960]  So Los Angeles about five years ago was like the huge scene for the secret underground
[21:48.960 --> 21:49.520]  seshes.
[21:50.160 --> 21:54.080]  The secret sesh, actually the legit Tim's secret sesh.
[21:54.080 --> 21:55.200]  It used to be before.
[21:55.200 --> 21:55.520]  I remember that.
[21:56.160 --> 21:56.660]  Right?
[21:57.520 --> 21:58.720]  I think he even like was able to-
[21:58.720 --> 22:00.240]  Came to Colorado for a little while.
[22:00.240 --> 22:02.000]  Yes, to a few other states.
[22:02.000 --> 22:02.640]  Yeah, he came on.
[22:03.600 --> 22:09.600]  And it was a huge like company got together and oh my gosh, you're right.
[22:09.600 --> 22:13.360]  There was a secret sesh that weekend of that High Times Cup.
[22:13.360 --> 22:16.480]  It was like in a warehouse-y downtown.
[22:16.480 --> 22:18.320]  Like I remember just brick walls.
[22:19.360 --> 22:21.920]  Now it's in Adelanto every time, right?
[22:21.920 --> 22:23.760]  I mean, obviously not right now, but-
[22:23.760 --> 22:24.880]  Well, you know, I-
[22:24.880 --> 22:27.920]  The baseball stadium or whatever.
[22:28.560 --> 22:29.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[22:29.680 --> 22:31.920]  Is it in Adelanto or is it Victorville?
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.480]  One of those, one of those desert cities.
[22:34.480 --> 22:40.640]  But yeah, because as soon as 2018 hit, we weren't allowed to have seshes.
[22:40.640 --> 22:44.720]  We weren't allowed to share any of our stuff with each other.
[22:44.720 --> 22:50.000]  You couldn't even like share a joint together apparently like against the law type.
[22:50.000 --> 22:58.720]  But anyway, so like before it escalated to what it did, he was throwing big mansion parties.
[22:58.720 --> 23:05.200]  It was like big mansions that got rented out in like the Hollywood Hills and Beverly Hills.
[23:05.200 --> 23:16.800]  And basically the whole sesh scene was something that like not everybody got to see ever or
[23:16.800 --> 23:18.160]  experience in general.
[23:18.160 --> 23:24.560]  Like I know that people started having seshes throughout the following years.
[23:24.560 --> 23:29.520]  Miami, I've seen some of fucking Florida seshes and that shit's pretty crazy.
[23:29.520 --> 23:38.720]  But as it like dwindled down for us legally here, you really got to see kind of-
[23:39.520 --> 23:43.520]  Because we've been smoking and growing weed in California since like the early 90s.
[23:43.520 --> 23:46.160]  Legally, we've been allowed to do that with our medical program.
[23:46.160 --> 23:48.480]  So we've just been doing the things for so long.
[23:48.480 --> 23:54.320]  So for me, it was like I went to these sessions and I documented everything.
[23:54.320 --> 23:59.520]  Like all the dabs we all used to take or all the vendors who would come and all the love
[23:59.520 --> 24:03.280]  that was shown because Adam and Tim, they did a lot of giveaways.
[24:03.280 --> 24:12.640]  And Weavers, he, Jaime would roll these big, intricate, massive, sexy like masterpieces.
[24:12.640 --> 24:18.000]  And so it was just really cool to see considering you didn't see it back then.
[24:18.080 --> 24:26.320]  So I'm just trying to bring things to the front where people, behind the scenes stuff.
[24:26.320 --> 24:30.800]  And that's kind of something that I would suggest for anybody who's like trying to build
[24:30.800 --> 24:34.560]  their following or build their social media reach.
[24:34.560 --> 24:42.480]  It's really about like showing your true, authentic self and generally everything that
[24:42.480 --> 24:52.240]  you're experiencing versus like super edited or like try-hards.
[24:52.240 --> 24:54.640]  Nobody really likes a try-hard, right?
[24:54.640 --> 24:59.280]  Like so yeah, I just tried to share everything that I could.
[24:59.280 --> 25:06.800]  And me being like a chick who grew weed, that wasn't, we didn't show our faces, right?
[25:06.800 --> 25:13.440]  I mean, how long was it before you guys posted your faces or came and started broadcasting
[25:13.440 --> 25:14.720]  on the YouTubes, right?
[25:15.280 --> 25:15.840]  How long ago?
[25:15.840 --> 25:18.800]  Just the last probably three years, three, four years.
[25:18.800 --> 25:19.360]  Just this year.
[25:19.360 --> 25:21.040]  So what was the mentality before that?
[25:22.640 --> 25:23.840]  Yeah, just behind the scenes.
[25:23.840 --> 25:25.360]  No case, no case, right?
[25:25.360 --> 25:25.840]  Yeah.
[25:25.840 --> 25:30.080]  Yeah, we had these little cannabis apps here in Denver where you didn't have to show your face.
[25:31.040 --> 25:33.280]  Mass Roots and this thing called Beauty.
[25:34.240 --> 25:38.880]  Yeah, so that's how everybody I felt like could start off, try to communicate with one another,
[25:38.880 --> 25:41.120]  but no one ever showed their face or anything.
[25:41.920 --> 25:45.680]  And it was almost silly, I felt like at first for people when they were on Instagram, it's like,
[25:47.200 --> 25:51.840]  now it's the platform it seems like for cannabis, unfortunately.
[25:51.840 --> 25:54.480]  That's the only place where everybody seems to be.
[25:55.040 --> 25:55.600]  Right.
[25:55.600 --> 26:02.880]  And it's like, I think I still to this day have my very first photo.
[26:02.880 --> 26:09.360]  Yeah, even in public, I'm at a gas station, yo, and people are like, Rad Reefer, right?
[26:09.360 --> 26:10.080]  It's like, so.
[26:12.880 --> 26:17.920]  Back then though, I still have this photo of my very first, I got some like dogs that
[26:17.920 --> 26:19.680]  are demanding my attention.
[26:19.680 --> 26:21.840]  That's why I keep snapping if you're wondering.
[26:22.240 --> 26:27.280]  So my very first photo that I actually showed my face and it wasn't even like,
[26:27.280 --> 26:33.120]  I mean, you always saw maybe like a weed nug and like some hair, right?
[26:33.120 --> 26:37.680]  There was like hair involved, but then one day it was like a leaf that was like this
[26:37.680 --> 26:39.280]  and you could kind of see me.
[26:39.280 --> 26:41.920]  And so it was finally, I was just like, fuck it, right?
[26:42.720 --> 26:47.920]  So I feel like for me, it was huge because I didn't,
[26:48.000 --> 26:48.880]  I didn't grow.
[26:48.880 --> 26:52.880]  I didn't even start smoking until I was like in my 20s.
[26:52.880 --> 26:55.280]  It was like a very adult decision for me.
[26:55.280 --> 27:00.880]  You know, it wasn't like I was growing since I was 12, like some of y'all out there.
[27:00.880 --> 27:06.800]  So how early did y'all start?
[27:06.800 --> 27:11.760]  How young, how young did you, were you when you started smoking the ganja?
[27:13.120 --> 27:14.320]  I started in 2000.
[27:14.640 --> 27:15.840]  Smoking the ganja.
[27:17.040 --> 27:24.800]  I started in 2008, actually growing it for like a focused career, not just bullshitting.
[27:24.800 --> 27:27.440]  Oh, I like that.
[27:28.800 --> 27:30.400]  But yeah, many, many mistakes.
[27:31.120 --> 27:35.440]  But that's why I think, you know, this is why everybody on the platform today is so
[27:35.440 --> 27:36.400]  big on education.
[27:36.400 --> 27:40.800]  And that's something I wanted to get out there too is some people might not know how giving
[27:40.800 --> 27:44.480]  you are to the community and talking about your style and the way that you farm and all that.
[27:46.720 --> 27:47.220]  Yeah.
[27:47.920 --> 27:49.360]  Can you kind of go into that a little bit?
[27:50.160 --> 27:52.960]  Like your style of farming, because it is a little bit different than
[27:54.080 --> 27:57.520]  some of the other guests that we've had, but we're encouraging that.
[27:58.960 --> 27:59.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[27:59.760 --> 28:06.320]  It goes right back to like, there's so many ways to 1994, 13.
[28:06.320 --> 28:07.760]  I'm just looking at the chat here.
[28:07.760 --> 28:08.560]  That's so weird.
[28:09.040 --> 28:10.480]  That's what makes this kind of fun for us.
[28:10.480 --> 28:14.720]  I guess this is my first like, this is a really cool like platform.
[28:15.360 --> 28:16.480]  Thank you guys again.
[28:16.480 --> 28:18.480]  Actually, Leighton, you'll like this one.
[28:18.480 --> 28:23.360]  I can't remember if I've told this before, but you know, in like fourth grade when the
[28:23.360 --> 28:29.920]  police officer comes to your school to show you like drugs and their program.
[28:29.920 --> 28:31.840]  So yeah, whatever it was called.
[28:31.840 --> 28:36.640]  But so in Dover, so first of all, John Walsh grew weed at his house.
[28:36.640 --> 28:38.080]  Leighton knows John Walsh.
[28:39.520 --> 28:47.600]  But so it was either fourth, you know, third, fourth grade and the cop came and he was showing
[28:47.600 --> 28:49.360]  everyone stuff and he had seeds.
[28:49.360 --> 28:52.080]  He's like, this is marijuana seeds.
[28:52.080 --> 28:57.520]  And when he was like, like talking to other kids, I went to his little like display thing
[28:58.080 --> 29:00.320]  and I took the seeds and I brought them home.
[29:00.960 --> 29:06.320]  And then that summer, my brother and I, we had all these bridal pads behind our house.
[29:06.320 --> 29:09.040]  So it was totally, you know, no humans or anything.
[29:09.680 --> 29:14.480]  And we planted them in the woods, you know, half a mile behind our house.
[29:14.480 --> 29:19.200]  And we had a three wheeler so we could, you know, ride the ATC back there, water the plants.
[29:21.920 --> 29:23.600]  That's guerrilla gardening.
[29:23.600 --> 29:24.160]  Carry on.
[29:25.520 --> 29:26.880]  How well did they grow?
[29:26.880 --> 29:27.680]  They grew okay.
[29:29.600 --> 29:32.640]  I mean, it was like, you know, in like lots of tree canopy.
[29:32.640 --> 29:35.760]  And I mean, I was eight, nine.
[29:35.760 --> 29:38.880]  My brother was 12, 13.
[29:40.240 --> 29:41.920]  But I mean, I'm the youngest of four.
[29:41.920 --> 29:48.480]  So like, okay, I always found their weed when I was, you know, in fifth grade, sixth grade.
[29:48.480 --> 29:49.840]  And I, you know, try it.
[29:49.840 --> 29:51.280]  And that was all the brick weed.
[29:52.480 --> 29:55.600]  But anyway, was that in LA area?
[29:55.600 --> 29:56.100]  Was that?
[29:56.880 --> 29:58.960]  That was in the outside Boston.
[29:59.520 --> 30:03.040]  Oh, in the town next to where Leighton grew up.
[30:04.400 --> 30:04.960]  I grew up.
[30:06.080 --> 30:06.960]  That's so great.
[30:07.680 --> 30:12.320]  So yeah, my first experience was, we were riding, it was seventh grade.
[30:12.320 --> 30:15.440]  We'd smoked this green hash that like, didn't even get you.
[30:16.400 --> 30:17.280]  It was just nasty.
[30:18.320 --> 30:20.240]  And we were riding our bikes home.
[30:21.040 --> 30:25.120]  And we saw a canvas plant off the side of the road in the field.
[30:25.120 --> 30:26.640]  And so we're like, oh my God.
[30:27.040 --> 30:27.540]  Yeah.
[30:28.240 --> 30:31.760]  So we go into this patch and there's a whole bunch of these plants growing.
[30:31.760 --> 30:35.200]  Now, we really didn't know the difference between males and females.
[30:36.080 --> 30:38.000]  But we could identify the leaf shape.
[30:38.640 --> 30:44.720]  And so we decided that we were going to go home and get trash bags and come back and bag it all up.
[30:44.720 --> 30:48.480]  So we get on our bikes, ride home, get trash bags, ride back.
[30:49.840 --> 30:56.160]  We stuffed our trash bags, tissue bags, each with the fucking cannabis or the hemp.
[30:56.240 --> 30:57.520]  I think it's really what it was.
[30:58.480 --> 30:59.920]  And we rode our bikes home.
[30:59.920 --> 31:04.720]  And on the way home, we drove past a police officer.
[31:04.720 --> 31:06.240]  We had pulled over another car.
[31:07.120 --> 31:11.120]  And so we're both having heart attacks because there's weed sticking out of the top.
[31:12.160 --> 31:13.680]  We're riding as fast as we can.
[31:13.680 --> 31:18.640]  And lo and behold, the fucking bag gets stuck in my tire and shrinks.
[31:18.640 --> 31:22.400]  Now, there's fucking cannabis flying all over the road, right in front of the fucking cop.
[31:22.880 --> 31:23.200]  Right.
[31:23.200 --> 31:27.440]  And now it's sucked into my fucking tire and I had to pull over.
[31:27.440 --> 31:28.560]  I can't ride anymore.
[31:28.560 --> 31:29.440]  Right in front of the guy.
[31:29.440 --> 31:34.240]  So I'm ripping the shit out, stuffing it kind of in the bag and just kind of like freaking
[31:34.240 --> 31:35.600]  and just fucking I'm out of here.
[31:35.600 --> 31:36.160]  Rode away.
[31:37.360 --> 31:40.240]  That cop used to come to my house and rake the leaves.
[31:40.240 --> 31:43.040]  And the next time he came to rake leaves, he looked at me and went,
[31:43.040 --> 31:43.540]  No!
[31:43.700 --> 31:44.200]  No!
[31:48.020 --> 31:54.100]  That was my earliest experience on not growing it, but harvesting someone else's wild hemp.
[31:54.100 --> 31:55.460]  Oh my gosh.
[31:55.460 --> 31:58.180]  It was a cannabis of some kind, I mean, but it didn't really get your stone.
[32:02.260 --> 32:04.580]  That's so fucking great, yo.
[32:04.580 --> 32:06.420]  Yeah, that was pretty crazy back then.
[32:06.420 --> 32:07.940]  I mean, this was in the 70s.
[32:07.940 --> 32:14.020]  So really, they were not happy about this plant invading our town.
[32:14.020 --> 32:15.140]  That's for sure.
[32:15.140 --> 32:17.140]  And that was like near Boston also?
[32:17.700 --> 32:20.500]  Yeah, it was the town over from Peter.
[32:20.500 --> 32:23.460]  So it's like probably 25 miles out of Boston.
[32:23.460 --> 32:29.060]  Very blue blood, very cultured, Christian environment.
[32:32.020 --> 32:33.460]  Were you guys able to get good weed back then?
[32:33.460 --> 32:35.780]  A lot of people going to church on Sundays.
[32:36.100 --> 32:36.900]  Oh yeah.
[32:36.900 --> 32:37.860]  On Christmas Day.
[32:40.020 --> 32:44.980]  So, you know, I wanted to bounce back on something you said earlier about managing energy.
[32:44.980 --> 32:51.060]  You know, like not allowing that lower branch to start pushing buds because it's a waste of energy.
[32:51.060 --> 32:53.700]  It's not going to where it needs to.
[32:53.700 --> 32:58.020]  And I think I'd love you to touch a little bit more for some of the younger growers out there
[32:58.020 --> 33:01.780]  and explaining why energy management in the plant is so important.
[33:02.580 --> 33:03.460]  Oh, yes.
[33:03.700 --> 33:04.740]  Good question.
[33:04.740 --> 33:12.100]  Or, you know, because it really took me along a lot of popcorn ass mother plants
[33:12.100 --> 33:15.380]  to realize that it just doesn't need to be there.
[33:15.380 --> 33:22.180]  But essentially, when you think about feeding and watering of cannabis plant,
[33:22.180 --> 33:26.660]  you're adding water to the medium where your roots are.
[33:26.740 --> 33:27.780]  Your roots are.
[33:27.780 --> 33:36.900]  And the way that the water gets to all the goodness is through transpiration.
[33:36.900 --> 33:43.700]  Basically, like the leaves of the plants, they have the little holes called stomata underneath them.
[33:44.580 --> 33:53.220]  The plant literally sweats out about like 98% of the water that we feed them.
[33:53.220 --> 33:56.260]  So in a way to control.
[33:56.260 --> 33:57.860]  Ooh, I got some cottonmouth.
[33:57.860 --> 33:58.340]  One sec.
[33:59.300 --> 34:00.420]  Some grapes.
[34:03.620 --> 34:09.620]  So essentially, like a way to steer your crops well.
[34:11.140 --> 34:17.540]  Something a lot of you in the last five years will have talked about is at some point while
[34:17.540 --> 34:21.860]  you're growing will be the VPD, really just the vapor pressure of the space.
[34:23.700 --> 34:31.880]  And that's going to control or help aid essentially how quickly the water is being
[34:31.880 --> 34:34.920]  pumped out of your leaves and into the environment.
[34:34.920 --> 34:42.600]  So what happens is, I mean, the best grow parameters we all know and everybody gets
[34:42.600 --> 34:45.720]  a little bit, you know, scared about higher humidity and mold.
[34:46.280 --> 34:51.880]  But I mean, as long as your mold is not a big deal, it's not systemic and it's present
[34:51.880 --> 34:52.920]  fucking everywhere.
[34:52.920 --> 34:57.320]  So as long as you're on top of it or you're really conscientious of the things that you
[34:57.320 --> 35:01.320]  allow in your grow room, like shop vacs are not allowed to go from space to space, you
[35:01.320 --> 35:03.160]  know, just little things like that.
[35:03.160 --> 35:11.160]  But allowing your humidity to be within a favorable range for a plant because it's a
[35:11.160 --> 35:11.800]  plant.
[35:11.800 --> 35:15.800]  So veg and really quick growth.
[35:15.800 --> 35:19.720]  You know, we like it in the 70, 75% higher when you're cloning.
[35:20.360 --> 35:29.080]  And flower, the more further into flower we get, we taper the humidity down because, you
[35:29.080 --> 35:33.000]  know, the buds are thick and the room is humid and we don't want to encourage things like
[35:34.120 --> 35:36.520]  PM or bud rot, et cetera.
[35:36.520 --> 35:47.480]  And so what's happening is, when you have your humidity proper, I have like, I've got
[35:47.480 --> 35:48.680]  two going on here.
[35:48.680 --> 35:57.800]  When you have your humidity proper, according to the grow periods, the cycle of the crop
[35:57.800 --> 36:05.720]  that you're in, veg, late flower, early flower, when we water and the nutrients get transported
[36:05.720 --> 36:13.480]  up based on how humid or not humid the environment is, the minerals, every little branch on the
[36:13.480 --> 36:19.000]  way up, I really wish I had like an ability to draw on the screen right now.
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.680]  But so we've got like our canopy, we've got our light.
[36:23.640 --> 36:32.200]  And so water gets fed and any branch on the way up to the canopy and the Goldilocks zone
[36:32.200 --> 36:37.880]  that we create because there's air circulation, there's the proper light spectrum, there's
[36:37.880 --> 36:41.640]  the proper PPFD rating as far as light intensity.
[36:41.640 --> 36:45.240]  That's like your Goldilocks zone if you think about the universe, right?
[36:45.240 --> 36:51.720]  Earth is perfect for us and we're always trying to cultivate the best environment for the
[36:52.360 --> 36:56.360]  most productive part of the plant, which is the colas, the tops.
[36:57.000 --> 37:05.480]  So if this is all my canopy and this is my light, anything with, you know, you think
[37:05.480 --> 37:12.520]  like an HPS light, a lot of us are still growing under HPS lights, four feet away from
[37:12.520 --> 37:18.280]  an HPS light is too far away to be in flower.
[37:18.280 --> 37:21.480]  You want to be like three feet, etc.
[37:21.480 --> 37:22.360]  Oh, Nica.
[37:22.920 --> 37:32.280]  So really, if your light source is only allowing for penetration three feet down, considering
[37:32.280 --> 37:36.520]  we've got leaves that are like grabbing all the lights and etc.
[37:36.520 --> 37:44.440]  So down here where the little tiny popcorn, larve producing like armpits, like I take
[37:44.440 --> 37:49.560]  armpit nodes, like if you've got a main branch and a branch, anything that's right here goes
[37:49.560 --> 37:58.040]  like essentially I carve out a whole fucking bubble, not even like a flat line because
[37:58.040 --> 38:04.280]  sometimes these branches that were trained to grow wider will produce as long as they
[38:04.280 --> 38:05.720]  reach that Goldilocks zone.
[38:05.720 --> 38:11.320]  But when you water and everything heads to that Goldilocks zone, anything along the way
[38:11.320 --> 38:12.280]  is a sucker.
[38:12.280 --> 38:18.840]  It's like they're going to take nutrients and minerals along the way.
[38:18.840 --> 38:22.520]  So energy, it's all about like energy.
[38:22.520 --> 38:23.640]  Everything is energy.
[38:23.960 --> 38:27.160]  We're moving all of our essential energies up.
[38:27.880 --> 38:33.800]  And if there are, and when you, yo, when you de-leaf or you shave legs, you need to make
[38:33.800 --> 38:39.560]  sure you're getting the little teeny growth node, not just the leaf.
[38:40.440 --> 38:45.400]  Even if you take the leaf and the petiole, there's still a teeny tiny growth node down
[38:45.400 --> 38:50.440]  there that needs to go too, because that thing will shoot up like a little inch in about
[38:50.440 --> 38:51.560]  seven days.
[38:51.560 --> 38:56.600]  And it's like, because if you aren't taking care of it in a timely fashion, you suddenly
[38:56.600 --> 39:03.240]  have this teeny bush down below like one inch little sucker mother, and it doesn't need
[39:03.240 --> 39:03.720]  to go.
[39:03.720 --> 39:09.720]  All that bush that's been cultivated, allowed to grow because you didn't get to it in a
[39:09.720 --> 39:17.240]  timely fashion because plants just keep growing, has taken that much energy from, it's robbed
[39:17.240 --> 39:21.080]  it from the upper canopies nutrients.
[39:21.080 --> 39:31.400]  So if I have 1000 ppms, by the time it travels up to the top, I may only have like 700 ppms
[39:31.400 --> 39:36.840]  flowing up because I've fed these little, like tomatoes, you prune the little suckers
[39:36.840 --> 39:38.440]  on tomato plants, right?
[39:38.440 --> 39:45.160]  Because you're directing energy towards the branches that you've fucking trained for the
[39:45.160 --> 39:46.920]  last six weeks of veg.
[39:46.920 --> 39:54.680]  So you really got to be intent with when you do it and how quickly it gets done.
[39:54.680 --> 39:59.720]  Like you don't want to top one half of your canopy and then top the other half of your
[39:59.720 --> 40:01.000]  canopy in like five days.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.800]  Like everything that happens in the room needs to happen at the same time.
[40:04.680 --> 40:06.840]  So it's all about consistency.
[40:07.720 --> 40:09.880]  I feel like I'm really long winded, yo.
[40:11.720 --> 40:12.840]  That's the style of...
[40:14.120 --> 40:16.040]  It's okay, none of us want to be talking.
[40:17.800 --> 40:21.080]  I loved your explanation of the Goldilocks.
[40:21.640 --> 40:26.280]  That's a great way of describing it because it is, it's the sweet spot.
[40:26.280 --> 40:27.880]  It's where all the magic happens.
[40:27.880 --> 40:33.800]  And if you're allowing shit to get sucked out on the way up, what are you doing?
[40:34.680 --> 40:36.200]  You're losing potential.
[40:36.200 --> 40:37.640]  So it's a great way of explaining it.
[40:37.640 --> 40:38.360]  Thank you.
[40:38.360 --> 40:38.920]  Yeah, yeah.
[40:38.920 --> 40:42.840]  We don't want to grow any weed on fucking Mercury or Venus.
[40:42.840 --> 40:44.120]  It's not favorable.
[40:44.120 --> 40:46.440]  But like Earth, hey, you know.
[40:48.280 --> 40:50.200]  So how aggressive are you defanning?
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.680]  So I like my big leaves.
[40:56.360 --> 40:57.320]  I really like them.
[40:57.320 --> 40:58.680]  It's your energy, right?
[40:58.680 --> 41:01.960]  Yeah, it's a store, it's a factory.
[41:01.960 --> 41:04.120]  They're the leaves that do the most...
[41:06.120 --> 41:06.440]  Thanks.
[41:06.440 --> 41:11.960]  That makes me feel like I am not so silly for talking so much.
[41:11.960 --> 41:18.600]  There's just so many ways to describe it that I try to fit in ways that many people can understand.
[41:22.520 --> 41:24.440]  I'm sorry, what was the question?
[41:29.540 --> 41:30.580]  What did I ask her now?
[41:31.220 --> 41:32.820]  You asked about the fan leaves.
[41:32.820 --> 41:33.300]  The fan leaves.
[41:33.300 --> 41:37.780]  How aggressive are you taking the fan leaves, which are big solar panels?
[41:37.780 --> 41:38.740]  Yes, yes, yes.
[41:38.740 --> 41:39.380]  Our energy.
[41:40.340 --> 41:42.420]  What's going on there when we remove that?
[41:42.420 --> 41:49.220]  And granted, I feel like in my opinion, sometimes bud will always trump fan leaf.
[41:49.220 --> 41:53.060]  But at the same time, I would rather sometimes fold that down than just rip it off.
[41:54.340 --> 41:59.780]  Or if you're going to rip it off, I wouldn't rip a few off daily.
[41:59.780 --> 42:08.900]  I would decide I'm going to de-leaf like 20% on day 21 and day 43 or whatever,
[42:08.900 --> 42:13.940]  depending on if it's an eight week or a 12 week strain too.
[42:13.940 --> 42:16.740]  Because yes, how aggressive I'd...
[42:16.740 --> 42:17.860]  So I like...
[42:18.740 --> 42:22.500]  I like that we can rely on everybody watching to remember what we were talking about.
[42:23.780 --> 42:25.220]  It's so many tangents too.
[42:25.220 --> 42:29.860]  I feel like I might have some bits of ADD that went undiagnosed.
[42:29.860 --> 42:30.740]  But anyway, so...
[42:32.900 --> 42:35.860]  And see, y'all in Colorado, especially,
[42:35.860 --> 42:41.940]  you guys are like pro fans of the schwozzie tech where you strip all your leaves off.
[42:41.940 --> 42:44.900]  And I was actually in a show last week,
[42:44.900 --> 42:49.540]  super fucking great show at Grandmaster level with this Canadian dude.
[42:49.540 --> 42:51.540]  Grandmaster level is his IG also.
[42:51.540 --> 42:53.780]  But he was showing me his grow.
[42:53.780 --> 42:55.140]  We were doing like screen sharing.
[42:55.700 --> 42:59.300]  And he was showing me like maybe week three.
[42:59.780 --> 43:05.220]  And there was that major de-leaf where all of the leaves go.
[43:05.220 --> 43:10.020]  And I, to be honest, I immediately get cringy, you know,
[43:10.020 --> 43:12.020]  but it's not like it doesn't produce.
[43:12.020 --> 43:15.940]  Like I watch it produce time and time again with other people's environments,
[43:15.940 --> 43:17.940]  but it's just not for me.
[43:19.300 --> 43:26.100]  So because I really like to say that I identify with myself as being like a greenhouse grower.
[43:26.580 --> 43:32.420]  Even though y'all see the indoor rooms right now,
[43:34.420 --> 43:37.700]  which is super cool because those just came online earlier this year.
[43:37.700 --> 43:44.020]  So I'm like at my fifth round of rockwool, but I'm changing.
[43:44.020 --> 43:48.580]  But anyway, so in a greenhouse, you really keep a lot of your leaves because
[43:48.820 --> 43:55.940]  the sun, I mean, any indoor grow environment is always going to be after what the sun can produce.
[43:55.940 --> 44:01.540]  And within the lighting industry, it's always super interesting to see everybody
[44:03.380 --> 44:08.580]  kind of like the next big thing is how many U-moles like this LED.
[44:09.220 --> 44:13.300]  Because I mean, in California, too, we're about to have a mandate, I think, in four years
[44:13.300 --> 44:17.140]  where all indoor rooms are going to be green.
[44:17.700 --> 44:24.980]  All indoor or all grow facilities, they need to be on LED and there's not going to be any rebates.
[44:26.180 --> 44:31.540]  I think here in the last two or three years, if you bought LEDs, California would rebate you back.
[44:32.340 --> 44:35.780]  I mean, whatever it was, if we need to know, I can find out.
[44:35.780 --> 44:41.540]  But I feel like now they were going to be mandated.
[44:41.540 --> 44:46.260]  So it's interesting to watch all these light companies just try to compete with each other.
[44:46.260 --> 44:52.980]  But the end goal is always like how close we can
[44:54.740 --> 44:58.580]  get to reproducing what the sun is putting off in the spring
[44:58.580 --> 45:01.940]  and what the sun is putting off in the fall, right?
[45:01.940 --> 45:02.980]  Like red and blue lights.
[45:05.140 --> 45:11.460]  So because I am a, I just like, I like greenhouse.
[45:11.460 --> 45:17.220]  I think the future, I think the best grow environment ever will be like hybrid greenhouse
[45:17.220 --> 45:24.660]  style, like a sun supplemented indoor, you know, like where all the environmentals are
[45:24.660 --> 45:27.780]  controlled, but we have the sun and lights if we need them type thing.
[45:27.780 --> 45:31.780]  But there you leave your leaves.
[45:31.780 --> 45:33.380]  We need our leaves.
[45:33.380 --> 45:35.700]  Like I, it's kind of like crop steering.
[45:35.700 --> 45:40.420]  Like, you know, it also, I was talking with Gene Finder OG a couple of seasons ago.
[45:40.420 --> 45:46.900]  We were talking about like the, it's called the LAI, the leaf area index.
[45:47.540 --> 45:53.380]  And, you know, it depends on the season that you're running in also.
[45:53.380 --> 46:00.020]  So it's like if it's less intensive light, because in the winter, you guys know, you
[46:00.020 --> 46:05.780]  guys don't have as long of a growing season and it's not just the temperatures.
[46:05.780 --> 46:08.900]  It's literally the UV index of the season.
[46:08.900 --> 46:16.740]  Like here in Southern California, where we cultivate in the summer, in the deserts, I
[46:16.740 --> 46:19.140]  have like a UV index of 12, yo.
[46:19.700 --> 46:27.060]  And after it filters through like the poly or in my greenhouse, right?
[46:27.940 --> 46:29.940]  Fuck, yes, agreed.
[46:29.940 --> 46:40.100]  But as soon as it filters through the, we run Solex Pro, it is still a really intense
[46:40.100 --> 46:43.620]  like UV spectrum that's coming through because it's intense to begin with.
[46:43.620 --> 46:48.100]  So, so with you guys in the mid middle of the country and in the mountains there in
[46:48.100 --> 46:53.460]  Colorado, like your UV index doesn't stay high for long at all.
[46:53.460 --> 47:04.100]  So essentially the LAI is going to describe like if you are in the winter with a low UV,
[47:04.100 --> 47:06.740]  low light intensity, you're not supplementing lights.
[47:08.100 --> 47:15.700]  You probably want to strip more leaves than you would if it was a super high intense light
[47:15.700 --> 47:19.540]  because light's capable of penetrating through the canopy better.
[47:19.540 --> 47:26.020]  And something that Gene Finder, Shor was talking about was, shout out to him by the
[47:26.020 --> 47:31.700]  way, was if you're in a position where you're stripping most of your leaves down, you really
[47:31.700 --> 47:38.260]  want to compensate for it by having like a higher EC feed, higher PPMs was what we found
[47:39.780 --> 47:41.300]  in the winter when we ran in the green.
[47:41.300 --> 47:43.300]  Cause I'll run all winter long.
[47:43.300 --> 47:45.220]  I've ran in the snow, you know what I'm saying?
[47:45.220 --> 47:50.500]  But you just have to be conscientious of what the plant is capable of doing.
[47:50.500 --> 47:55.140]  Cause you also have like things to deal with like colder root zones and et cetera.
[47:55.140 --> 48:04.980]  But I keep my leaves too indoor except for my two defoliation dances I have mid cycles
[48:07.540 --> 48:14.660]  because I have found that when you fuck up or do something like it escalates so quickly
[48:14.660 --> 48:15.540]  and rock wall.
[48:15.540 --> 48:18.100]  So my leaves literally saved me.
[48:19.620 --> 48:22.420]  The plants are still fucking smashing.
[48:22.420 --> 48:29.140]  Nothing happened, but we got some ugly leaves, but they were able to utilize whatever was
[48:29.140 --> 48:35.860]  stored in those dang leaves because if I had no leaves, then I'd have been like slayed,
[48:35.860 --> 48:36.900]  totally slayed.
[48:36.900 --> 48:39.220]  So yeah, I'm just a fan of leaves.
[48:39.220 --> 48:44.900]  So it's like in the summertime or in a high light grow environment, leave a little bit
[48:44.900 --> 48:53.220]  more leaf because the leaves are also what essentially the plants will use as far as
[48:53.220 --> 48:59.140]  their own mechanisms to raise the humidity around the plant itself.
[48:59.140 --> 49:06.740]  So it's like, if you're in an environment where, so I'm in a really dry environment,
[49:06.740 --> 49:08.500]  I'm not like coastal.
[49:09.060 --> 49:18.580]  And I don't have high humidity, but if you're in a really humid environment, you're going to
[49:18.580 --> 49:27.060]  tend to run a drier grow space because of pathogens and the likelihood of some of these
[49:28.260 --> 49:35.940]  spaces that are growing out there are way higher of getting chances of things like
[49:35.940 --> 49:37.140]  powdery mildew spores.
[49:38.260 --> 49:42.660]  Not only do we run positive pressure rooms to make sure nothing is sucking in every time
[49:42.660 --> 49:51.220]  you open a door, but if the room is more dry, the plant works harder to push out
[49:53.540 --> 49:58.660]  the vapors through transpiration to raise the humidity around themselves.
[49:58.660 --> 50:05.460]  So that's another reason why the whole making sure your humidity is within range because
[50:05.460 --> 50:07.780]  otherwise you're making the plant work harder too.
[50:08.740 --> 50:14.260]  It's like, oh, I'm too dry and pushes more humidity out when it could be like focusing
[50:14.260 --> 50:15.300]  on the other things.
[50:15.300 --> 50:15.540]  Right.
[50:19.220 --> 50:21.220]  So, yeah, I leave my leaves.
[50:21.220 --> 50:21.620]  Sorry.
[50:24.780 --> 50:30.020]  What do you think of like another thing that I personally like when I'm pheno hunting is
[50:30.020 --> 50:34.980]  when you have the more of the fan leaf on there, you're going to be able to tell certain
[50:35.060 --> 50:40.100]  genetics by the rails that might grow on that family as well that I feel like you might
[50:40.100 --> 50:43.460]  miss out on if you're if you're hunting at scale.
[50:44.740 --> 50:53.540]  Yeah, the leaf, the serrated edges on leaves are definitely like a huge visual expression
[50:53.540 --> 51:01.460]  that you'll see among different seeds, whether or not that's indicative of whatever it is
[51:01.460 --> 51:06.580]  you may be hunting for out of the because I mean, you guys will.
[51:06.580 --> 51:13.220]  Yo, so how do you how do you how do you think your weed is out in Colorado?
[51:13.220 --> 51:15.940]  Because I hear you guys have a hard time keeping it.
[51:17.620 --> 51:19.380]  Hey, are you?
[51:21.460 --> 51:23.060]  I don't know why you got to stab us in the heart.
[51:23.620 --> 51:25.460]  They're known for their concentrate.
[51:25.460 --> 51:26.020]  I know.
[51:26.580 --> 51:27.380]  It's the polite way to say it.
[51:27.620 --> 51:28.340]  Gosh, I know.
[51:28.340 --> 51:35.620]  And like some of the best extract dudes that I know are from from that market, but I'm still
[51:35.620 --> 51:36.180]  like I'm.
[51:38.420 --> 51:38.920]  One of them.
[51:40.820 --> 51:41.540]  Hey, guys.
[51:43.540 --> 51:51.700]  So yeah, I mean, is it do you think it's because you guys are already so dry that you.
[51:53.780 --> 51:56.100]  Or you just don't know how to grow good weed?
[51:56.180 --> 51:59.060]  I mean, there's things such as humidifiers, right?
[51:59.060 --> 52:00.660]  There's those contraptions.
[52:03.620 --> 52:08.500]  I feel like we lose really the quality at the end, you know, when we start hanging things
[52:08.500 --> 52:12.180]  up and it's just nobody really has some state of the art room.
[52:12.740 --> 52:17.140]  Why do you think that is like, is it so I've tried it.
[52:17.140 --> 52:18.180]  I've chatted with a few.
[52:18.420 --> 52:28.180]  Some licensed producers out in Colorado, and I think y'all are big fans of trim machines
[52:28.180 --> 52:28.660]  as well.
[52:31.620 --> 52:33.860]  Boy, she's airing the dirty laundry today, boy.
[52:36.020 --> 52:36.980]  But yes, that is true.
[52:37.540 --> 52:41.220]  And that's why education, I feel like, is key, because a lot of these people that come
[52:41.220 --> 52:44.180]  to Colorado, they don't necessarily understand all that.
[52:44.580 --> 52:45.860]  We want to make sure you're good.
[52:46.660 --> 52:48.500]  You know, I'm just curious.
[52:48.500 --> 52:49.780]  It's like because the color.
[52:49.780 --> 52:50.900]  You're not hurting our feelings.
[52:50.900 --> 52:54.180]  The Colorado any expo I've ever been to.
[52:54.180 --> 52:58.340]  That's one of the first questions people ask us is how do you how do you combat that?
[52:58.900 --> 53:03.460]  You know, and again, it comes down, in my opinion, to genetics and, you know, the room
[53:03.460 --> 53:05.220]  set up the environment that you can create.
[53:05.860 --> 53:10.740]  Like you said, there are fancy humidity, humidifiers that you can purchase and stuff like
[53:10.740 --> 53:13.700]  that, but not every brand feels that way.
[53:14.580 --> 53:21.700]  And that's why, at least in my opinion, quality is got to be the ultimate concern for a brand,
[53:21.700 --> 53:25.140]  because the only business is repeat business, especially here in Denver.
[53:29.120 --> 53:33.520]  You know, I'm really surprised that that isn't more of an issue out there is that they create
[53:33.520 --> 53:36.960]  like a humidor where they store cigars.
[53:36.960 --> 53:41.840]  There's no reason why they can't do a humidor for for cannabis in the initial drying phase
[53:41.840 --> 53:46.320]  so that it doesn't dry too quick, because that is that's how you lose your turf's really
[53:46.960 --> 53:48.720]  absolutely low humidity.
[53:48.720 --> 53:55.920]  So I'm really surprised that that isn't really a forefront in the minds of cannabis producers
[53:55.920 --> 53:56.960]  in Colorado.
[53:57.600 --> 53:59.360]  You know, it's interesting.
[54:00.800 --> 54:04.240]  Yeah, because the guys we used to connect with in Savannah and stuff back in the day,
[54:04.880 --> 54:08.480]  that was how they would really sell their weed is they'd be able to take it and then
[54:08.480 --> 54:10.240]  throw it a little bit on the wall.
[54:10.240 --> 54:14.240]  And if it stuck to the wall, that was that was all the branding and marketing you need
[54:14.240 --> 54:14.720]  right there.
[54:15.600 --> 54:18.800]  To be truthful, I've never seen that here in Colorado.
[54:18.800 --> 54:24.880]  You know, I've never seen it where it's been able to be that East Coast quality or West
[54:24.880 --> 54:27.840]  Coast quality with the humidity.
[54:31.270 --> 54:34.870]  Well, I think she's muted your audio, your audio.
[54:36.950 --> 54:37.450]  Hi.
[54:38.550 --> 54:39.110]  She's back.
[54:39.830 --> 54:40.870]  You haven't.
[54:40.870 --> 54:45.830]  So I feel like you've sort of pushed Colorado off the ledge.
[54:45.830 --> 54:50.710]  You could give it one last shove with some what what else is Colorado known for?
[54:52.870 --> 54:58.950]  Well, I mean, because you've hit two terrible, terrible weed and trim machines.
[54:58.950 --> 55:01.190]  What's the third one you want to throw in there?
[55:01.190 --> 55:02.870]  No, there's definitely good weed.
[55:02.870 --> 55:03.990]  I want to put that out there.
[55:03.990 --> 55:06.710]  There's big brands that are doing it right.
[55:06.710 --> 55:11.990]  But when you're talking about the majority of what's going on here, she is on.
[55:12.870 --> 55:18.550]  I feel like there's definitely the cottage growers or the smaller canopies that aren't
[55:19.110 --> 55:20.550]  just trying to make sure.
[55:20.550 --> 55:24.710]  I mean, there's a difference in a in a it's OK.
[55:24.710 --> 55:32.710]  So a lot of the things that I have noticed, I've worked with a few larger companies in
[55:32.710 --> 55:33.430]  my day.
[55:33.430 --> 55:34.150]  Right.
[55:34.150 --> 55:43.510]  And something that I noticed, too, is like the actual method of harvesting, like when
[55:43.510 --> 55:47.430]  it comes to, you know, your flower period is the trimester.
[55:47.430 --> 55:52.630]  But that does not include the hang dry harvest trim dance that you have to do.
[55:52.630 --> 55:52.950]  Right.
[55:53.510 --> 55:54.230]  Yeah.
[55:54.230 --> 55:55.350]  No, Mids.
[55:58.070 --> 56:03.430]  But really quick to reflect back on Colorado, like fire.
[56:03.430 --> 56:04.790]  Fire concentrate.
[56:04.790 --> 56:11.110]  And you absolutely cannot have fire concentrate without good starting material.
[56:11.110 --> 56:11.430]  Right.
[56:11.990 --> 56:17.110]  So it's not that you are or that there aren't any good growers in Colorado.
[56:17.110 --> 56:26.710]  It's just that something is happening on shelves and here in California to really everywhere,
[56:26.710 --> 56:32.710]  because there's a specific standard that you have to uphold yourself as far as like preserving
[56:32.710 --> 56:44.230]  cannabis, because when it's tested, the terpene tests back at day three of fucking drying
[56:44.230 --> 56:49.430]  is not going to be the same as like three months in a little eighth package.
[56:49.430 --> 56:50.470]  You know what I'm saying?
[56:50.470 --> 56:59.990]  So something's happening in the meth in the delivery of grow to consumer, like because
[57:00.390 --> 57:06.310]  here in California, it's like there's big distribution centers who literally have products
[57:06.310 --> 57:16.390]  sitting on their warehouse shelves waiting for dispensaries to intake, you know, more
[57:16.390 --> 57:16.870]  products.
[57:16.870 --> 57:21.270]  So and like like we say, like we doesn't it doesn't stop growing.
[57:21.910 --> 57:22.870]  So, yeah, exactly.
[57:22.870 --> 57:23.510]  It's old.
[57:23.750 --> 57:28.550]  So but I mean, you know, like no, no joke.
[57:28.550 --> 57:35.670]  There's so many Colorado has produced some of the craziest fucking concentrates.
[57:35.670 --> 57:42.710]  And you guys were like some of the first ones, TNT extracts and his diamonds, like phenomenal,
[57:42.710 --> 57:45.990]  like, you know, all greens, Denver.
[57:45.990 --> 57:49.990]  They've got a lot of different cool, like extracts.
[57:50.310 --> 57:55.510]  So not to say that, you know, not not because you guys are Colorado.
[57:55.510 --> 57:57.350]  No, I have a Colorado audience.
[57:57.350 --> 58:04.790]  I can't like I'm just saying, like, it's really crazy if you if you zoom out on like not even
[58:04.790 --> 58:12.230]  the United States, right, like the world platform, because we got like Costa Rica and we've got
[58:12.230 --> 58:13.510]  like fucking what?
[58:13.510 --> 58:13.990]  Who was it?
[58:13.990 --> 58:19.910]  Uruguay or something that came online like Israel is like has been banging away.
[58:20.390 --> 58:21.670]  You massive canopies.
[58:21.670 --> 58:23.030]  There's like so many.
[58:24.630 --> 58:29.910]  Operations worldwide that are happening that we aren't even because we're all in our own
[58:29.910 --> 58:30.550]  little bubble.
[58:30.550 --> 58:37.110]  Cannabis industry has this tendency to keep us like looking at what this next guy is doing
[58:37.110 --> 58:39.750]  versus like what the next fucking country is doing.
[58:39.750 --> 58:40.470]  Right.
[58:40.470 --> 58:44.310]  And so it's like everybody's.
[58:44.870 --> 58:47.190]  So I was when I was doing this, I was asking.
[58:47.190 --> 58:54.710]  So have you never got you haven't experienced yet when you take a bud and you like crack
[58:54.710 --> 59:01.190]  it open and you see all the spider webs like of all the terpenes like just string across
[59:01.190 --> 59:05.030]  like fucking you haven't done that yet.
[59:05.030 --> 59:05.590]  Oh, my gosh.
[59:05.590 --> 59:06.470]  You have to come over.
[59:06.470 --> 59:08.710]  Just come to California when I harvest.
[59:11.430 --> 59:13.190]  Yeah, I believe that's the stickiness.
[59:13.190 --> 59:14.870]  I mean, Layton could attest to that probably.
[59:15.670 --> 59:17.510]  That wall stick, right?
[59:17.510 --> 59:18.070]  Right.
[59:18.070 --> 59:22.950]  And and for at least for me growing up in Georgia, a lot of the fire genetics were coming
[59:22.950 --> 59:23.670]  from Florida.
[59:24.310 --> 59:25.270]  Oh, yeah.
[59:26.390 --> 59:29.670]  Do you remember any of that stuff ever get West?
[59:30.710 --> 59:31.830]  What was it called?
[59:31.830 --> 59:32.630]  Crippy with a K.
[59:33.430 --> 59:33.990]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:34.550 --> 59:39.190]  It's so funny that we're talking about Florida because my partner is he's a Florida boy and
[59:39.190 --> 59:46.310]  there's so many people from Florida in the game because it's like it's like Florida should
[59:46.310 --> 59:49.190]  have been like a rainforest down there.
[59:49.190 --> 59:49.590]  Yeah.
[59:49.590 --> 59:50.150]  Oh, yeah.
[59:50.150 --> 59:55.430]  I mean, every day, you know, be but speaking of like Florida strains.
[59:55.430 --> 01:00:02.150]  Oh, you guys would probably know Twisty Seeds because he's he was, you know, like, I met
[01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:03.030]  him in Oklahoma.
[01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:05.030]  Yeah, he's in Oklahoma now.
[01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.350]  So he he's Florida.
[01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:17.590]  He's a Florida boy and he's got this Vulcan fire, fire as strain called Palm Beach Sour.
[01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:23.670]  And it is basically like the purple sour diesel, I guess.
[01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:24.150]  Right.
[01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:27.430]  Purple sour diesel, the Cubans down in Florida.
[01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:32.630]  And you had to like be you had to know like you had to be within to be able to even touch
[01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.830]  or get.
[01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:38.870]  I mean, I've been to Florida and when we were down there, it was like, yo, I need to see this
[01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:46.790]  purple sour diesel that y'all, you know, and so I'm I was totally blessed by Twisty recently.
[01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:50.950]  I've got a couple of he knows of that purple sour diesel.
[01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:56.230]  So we're about to fill some rooms and like, yeah, Florida's got some good weed.
[01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:57.670]  And, yo, Josh D.O.G.
[01:00:57.670 --> 01:01:00.710]  Like the the real OG story.
[01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:01.670]  He's Florida.
[01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:03.430]  That's a Florida OG.
[01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:06.790]  You know, so Florida like Florida.
[01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:11.750]  Like there's a million old heads down there, too, that would never be on the radio.
[01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:13.990]  Yo, Fox Tracks.
[01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:18.630]  He's he's Florida based also.
[01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:19.270]  Shout out to him.
[01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.910]  He's phenomenal.
[01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:25.110]  He's a he is the man to get CBD seeds from to as well.
[01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:27.830]  So, yeah, Georgia, though.
[01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:29.990]  So how long?
[01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.110]  We just get genetics.
[01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:36.390]  We're not we were always just a hub of like trying to get it at a price and sell that
[01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:37.430]  another price.
[01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:40.630]  You know, unfortunately, sometimes it would come as brick weed.
[01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:42.790]  And then other times, like I was saying, it would stick to the wall.
[01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:47.670]  So the customers sometimes would be like, dude, like you need to work on your networking
[01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:50.550]  is quality.
[01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:53.270]  Consistency was tough by the time I got to Georgia.
[01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:55.430]  Interesting.
[01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:59.110]  And it's so crazy, like the links that but we'll not talk about that.
[01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:04.470]  Yeah, that's I would imagine most people know this story.
[01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:09.430]  There's a lot of cowboys and cowgirls that have to get that to move around the country
[01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.910]  like that.
[01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:14.790]  So so by the time it gets where I don't know how is it?
[01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:18.550]  I would I would imagine upper East Coast.
[01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.270]  There's still such a high demand for that.
[01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:25.910]  You guys, especially like probably New York and some of the bigger you guys probably never
[01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:27.110]  had a problem with quality.
[01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:28.230]  Yeah, there's like.
[01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:29.030]  Yeah, we did.
[01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:33.190]  I mean, we had getting it or growing it.
[01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:38.070]  Well, back in the day, we had these droughts that lasted.
[01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:43.750]  I mean, we'd get we'd get the Cali bud in the in the late fall, early winter, and then
[01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:46.790]  we'd burn through that by, you know, January, February.
[01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:50.310]  And then there was nothing until the brick we came in in late spring.
[01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:54.070]  So, you know, I tell the kids this shit and they're like, what do you mean you ran out
[01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:54.310]  of weed?
[01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:55.590]  Yeah, every year we.
[01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:03.270]  Yeah, yeah, it was hardcore, man.
[01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:04.070]  It was hardcore.
[01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:06.870]  But nowadays, I mean, like Maine's killing it.
[01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:11.030]  I think Maine's biggest crop right now is is cannabis.
[01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:13.190]  Yeah, they finally.
[01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:16.470]  They did away with the plant count.
[01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:17.190]  They did away with that.
[01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.750]  They did.
[01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:19.350]  They had a plant limit.
[01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:21.190]  And I think this season they did away with it.
[01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:22.390]  So they're finally doing it.
[01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:30.950]  Yeah, she's a female grower up in Maine who who like had to veg like four months before
[01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:34.950]  she to fill the canopy space because they had a plant limit.
[01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:36.950]  And it was like, oh, my God.
[01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:42.390]  So really crazy to see how things get done, right?
[01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:44.470]  Yeah, very similar.
[01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.950]  I don't think.
[01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:47.750]  There's no there's no guidelines.
[01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:52.230]  So every state decided to just do whatever they thought was right, which was kind of
[01:03:52.790 --> 01:03:53.830]  stupid in hindsight.
[01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:56.630]  But I think things are shaken out now.
[01:03:56.630 --> 01:04:01.910]  You know, the new states that are coming online are more realistic regulations, which is good.
[01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:04.070]  And yeah, so Maine's killing it.
[01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:06.230]  Maine's absolutely blowing it out of the water at this point.
[01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:08.790]  Oklahoma, D.C.
[01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:22.150]  Yeah, there's a lot of bad weed right now.
[01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:28.150]  But shout out to the, you know, the bigger farmers out there in Oklahoma, because it's
[01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:34.470]  really allowing them to, you know, their star to shine because the quality speaks for itself.
[01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:37.590]  I mean, there's still brown weed out there in Oklahoma.
[01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:45.430]  I think I think Oklahoma did the right thing, too, with the regulations.
[01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:47.350]  They were they were very open.
[01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:52.070]  They didn't make it, you know, just ridiculously expensive to enter into the market.
[01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:57.030]  They didn't penalize you once you did enter the market, which allowed for for, you know,
[01:04:57.030 --> 01:05:01.190]  some freedom, some room so that even the little guys could get it, which I think is should
[01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:05.750]  be the way that every state approaches it, not just letting one, you know, billionaire
[01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:07.590]  come in and own all the licenses.
[01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:08.390]  Right.
[01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:09.590]  That's just my two cents.
[01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:11.270]  Yeah.
[01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:16.950]  Colorado, you guys didn't have very many license holders amongst many licenses that you had
[01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:17.830]  early on, right?
[01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:21.990]  No, it was as far as I know, is really corporate.
[01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:25.270]  I've never actually been able to be a part of that other than just an employee.
[01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:26.790]  But right.
[01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:31.350]  As far as I understand, it's pretty brutal to have that fancy red badge.
[01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:37.350]  And then when Sweet Leaf that kind of I don't know if you're familiar with all that.
[01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:44.230]  There's kind of a debacle here where a well-known dispensary Sweet Leaf had like 23 stores,
[01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:45.350]  I think, or something like that.
[01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:49.830]  And then it all got shut down one day by the feds because of something that they called
[01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:50.310]  looping.
[01:05:50.310 --> 01:05:54.310]  So I feel like they tighten that even more when all that stuff happened.
[01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:55.510]  Or that's what it's like.
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:01.100]  I don't know if you're familiar that.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.060]  What was that?
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:02.380]  Right.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.340]  Looping out there.
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:07.660]  So back in the day, looping, you would just sit outside, like, especially some of the
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.780]  real entrepreneurs, to be honest with you.
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:13.340]  And you could, you know, wait by your phone.
[01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:18.940]  Somebody call you, then walk into the dispensary, purchase product, walk outside, sell it to
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:22.460]  somebody that didn't have the ability to go into that dispensary.
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:23.900]  And then people run it.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.940]  That was called looping.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:32.300]  And that dispensary and I hope I don't like it seemed like they were encouraging that,
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:34.060]  which obviously is a no.
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:35.020]  It was sales, right?
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.140]  They benefited.
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:41.420]  If you have that many stores, obviously it's generating a huge.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.220]  So when that was shut down, like, I think a lot of things changed.
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:48.060]  The whole wholesale market seemed to change because that one dispensary seemed to be buying
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:49.020]  up everything in town.
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.380]  And again, I'm on the outside looking in.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:52.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:56.620]  No, no, I mean, they're better than me, but a lot of like.
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:09.500]  I think pre-coronavirus, like, I know you guys really took the mask on mandate real,
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.980]  real like, well, some states are still pretty.
[01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:17.740]  I don't, you know, but before coronavirus, I was in Oklahoma City.
[01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:24.540]  We were going online with project and then it hit.
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:29.260]  So all of your consulting becomes like virtual, right?
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:37.180]  But we're, land was purchased and will probably be operational up in spring by then.
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:44.700]  And I feel like I'm definitely grateful to be a part of the project, but it's also one
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:51.660]  of those things where it's like California has been doing it for a long time.
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:58.540]  And if this was, if Oklahoma is essentially California 10 years ago, right, it really
[01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:08.540]  is an opportunity to make sure that we're not fumbling out the gate because you've already
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:12.140]  gone through and learned what you don't want to do.
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:19.500]  And there's so many states right now that have already done the dance of like getting
[01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:26.860]  and distributing licenses and et cetera, that there's a lot of like examples to follow and
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:29.660]  paths to follow and things totally not to do.
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:31.040]  Right.
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:38.140]  But I think Oklahoma's got a lot of opportunity, you know, to anybody that's out there right
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:44.780]  now, like you guys are kind of setting the stage as far as like being like one of the
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:53.580]  last wild, wild west opportunities to get it right because they're really not as restrictive
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:09:02.700]  in the sense of some places like, yo, California, there were maybe like, maybe like my, so California
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:07.580]  recreational prop 64 in like 2018.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:17.500]  And you, you really, they never, they gave you hope.
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:25.980]  They gave you like some bones, right, to like draw you and give you like hope that it would
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:30.700]  be like, but no, dude, it's so overtaxed.
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:35.340]  And the loopholes and how many times it gets taxed along the way.
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:43.020]  And that's like put back on the consumer and a lot of it costs so much fucking money to
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:43.820]  get in the game.
[01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:54.940]  And I mean, one, one project, 2000, I think late 2018 was like in San Luis Obispo County
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:57.580]  and they were super thrilled to have us.
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:03.900]  But you also have to understand that you're going to be in a marriage type of situation
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:09.180]  with these people that you're involved with and investing in and they're investing in
[01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:16.700]  you and, you know, so you really got to make sure that you're going to mentally be able
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:24.380]  to deal with everybody forever because it's a long game, you know?
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:27.900]  And so there were a lot of things that just didn't work out.
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:34.380]  And that's like story time and time and time again with like so many people who have tried
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:41.260]  and tried it because all the counties had their own, their own like rules and regulations
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:44.620]  and where you could put up and where you couldn't.
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:48.220]  And so you, you really had to like learn one county after another county.
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:51.500]  And that's kind of the same way with state after state, but the new states don't even
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:54.540]  know really what they're doing yet, right?
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:59.500]  So it's just, it's always mindset.
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:03.180]  You just got to be aware of that and have the emotional intelligence because nobody
[01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:08.300]  likes to be blown up on and then be like, oh, my bad, you know, like, so.
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:13.980]  That's interesting to hear you coming out to Oklahoma City.
[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.300]  You're going to crush out there.
[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.420]  I take it you're taking the whole miseradery for branding and the whole thing.
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.860]  Um, it's, yeah.
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:23.660]  Another project.
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:28.620]  Well, I mean, it's definitely like something we're considering.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.380]  I'd love to.
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:41.260]  I'm also 1000% on board with just being there to help smash it, you know, because these
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:45.900]  guys have worked really, really hard to get as far along in the project that they are
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:51.740]  and they're two fabulous brothers and they're already, uh, um, an extract company.
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:54.060]  So it's pretty vertically integrated.
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:12:00.060]  And again, talking about California or Colorado and your guys' extract game is on point.
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:09.740]  It's like, if Oklahoma is producing kind of mids, uh, we want to like know mids life and
[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:18.060]  get, um, our extract groups, uh, proper starting material to really see what they can do because
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:25.180]  there's no, unless you're CRCing, unless you're, you know, cleaning up, uh,
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:31.820]  preserving the starting material properly, it's going to totally reflect in the end material.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:32.700]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:39.260]  And if these 10 year ago growers, not, not to say everybody's like that in Oklahoma,
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:43.260]  there's some fucking awesome groups that are already out there.
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:50.860]  Um, yo, uh, the homie Jarrell, uh, Hollywood Undead, his grow company is Dove and Grenade.
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:53.260]  I think they're slaying it right now.
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:55.660]  Um, uh, he's a grower.
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:59.020]  He's like, uh, I think he might be the vocalist.
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.900]  He's probably going to kill me if he isn't, but, or one of them.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:04.380]  And, um, and it was really cool.
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:07.580]  We kind of both started growing, uh, alongside.
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:12.940]  We used to text each other and stuff about, and so now he's slaying it, uh, over in Oklahoma.
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:16.780]  So it's not to say that there aren't, you know, not to say that there aren't good ones,
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:19.660]  but, but we really got to, you know, we're educating.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:28.140]  It's our mission as like people who, who are trying to teach how to grow or trying to produce.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:31.180]  There's a difference in a company who's just trying to produce.
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:37.500]  Like the number at the end of the day is what matters versus a company or a group or a grower
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:44.460]  or a cultivator who's trying to properly produce and really like see what strains can hit and
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:46.060]  really see how they can perform.
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:49.820]  Because if you test your crop, for example, you test your strain and there's.
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:52.380]  CBG level still present.
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:57.500]  That really tells you that you can push it a little bit farther to convert that CBG into
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.940]  THCA, you know?
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:05.820]  So there's little things that kind of give you an idea of how well, and, and, you know,
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:11.100]  there's a huge difference in how you treat an eight week strain versus a 12 week strain,
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:11.580]  right?
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.020]  There's a big difference in that.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:13.520]  So.
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:16.060]  Yeah.
[01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:21.580]  Are you, are you growing perpetually growing that different, those different varieties like that?
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:23.680]  Yeah.
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:26.300]  Perpetual is kind of the only way to do it.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:33.820]  I actually, I'm fortunate enough to work with this awesome clone group out of Los Angeles
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.140]  called Mama Funk Clones.
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:40.700]  Like woman runs, there's some amazing dudes on the team.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:41.420]  Hey guys.
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:43.580]  But you know, she, she slays it.
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:50.140]  And we recently like teamed up because I am an admirer of the cultivars that she's got on her
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:50.700]  menu.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:15:01.020]  And I'm able to know without a doubt, there's no like bad sprays, no PM, no bugs.
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:01.980]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:08.460]  Like starting genetics out the gate is really important or just health crop, crop health.
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:11.420]  You want healthy babies before you do anything.
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:17.340]  So yeah, I've been fortunate enough to work with her recently.
[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:20.380]  So what was the question?
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:27.340]  You're just talking about your, you know, getting your genetics and that kind of stuff from your.
[01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:27.580]  Yeah.
[01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:28.620]  Perpetual.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:29.120]  Yes.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.000]  Actually growing it.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:31.680]  Yeah.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:40.160]  So you know, I'm fortunate to have a cool network of growers that yeah, she does.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:48.800]  I'm fortunate to work with a cool, like bunch of, of growers who all like have the similar
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.400]  passion to pop seeds.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.920]  And, you know, I think I've been a, a strain tester.
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:58.400]  I've been working with closely with a bunch of breeders for maybe the last 10 years.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:08.080]  So being able to run some testers and, you know, know if it's worth your time because a lot,
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:17.680]  you, you're not gonna, they're considering LEDs are and stacked vertical growing like on those.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:19.440]  What is it?
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:25.680]  Pip, pip horticulture, those tables that fucking turn with a crank that are stacked anyway.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.400]  So these stacked LEDs, have you guys seen those?
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.960]  That pip company, pip, P I P P.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.760]  No, I've definitely seen vertical stacking and stuff.
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:39.360]  And maybe late, we could even talk about that.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:43.040]  Have you ever seen a grow that really is successful at that?
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.720]  Cause it seems like there's always pockets.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:49.040]  The more, the higher everything goes less attention to detail.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:49.540]  It seems.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.040]  Yeah.
[01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.520]  You, that's always been a big problem for sure.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.240]  You know, the higher it is, the harder it is to work.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.400]  It's a different atmosphere up there.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.680]  So there's a lot of challenges with that.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:09.840]  I personally don't know is if, unless you literally bubble it up there so that it's,
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:14.400]  it's own little controlled environment, you're ever going to get a really successful grow that way.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:20.800]  I've seen these guys talking about five and six levels of growing, but they are going to,
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:26.000]  they're going to basically tent out each shelf and you'll have man lifts to get up there to work on.
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:31.440]  That's a lot of expense, but you know, Hey, if you're going big and you have the,
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:34.960]  you know, the runway behind you to afford that kind of start, then cool.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.400]  But it'd be interesting to see, you know, in the next couple of years,
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:42.880]  as they get through phase two, how well that that system actually performs.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:47.520]  But no, traditionally, as soon as you go up one layer, you have all another set of challenges.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:52.000]  And just my experience from, from seeing all those,
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:56.080]  it seems like the vigor is less and less every floor that you go up.
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.120]  The overall health of the plant itself.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:05.120]  Well, we know how important that health is, right? I mean, that's, that's, what's going to
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:10.880]  produce those you know, secondary compounds that we're all looking for. And so if it doesn't have
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:15.760]  that vigor, how are you going to hit plant potential? So that's, again, one of the
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:21.440]  challenges of trying to do, you know, tiered growing systems. Yeah. We'll see, we'll see how
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:26.720]  it goes. I mean, there's, we're going to see a lot of them coming online in 2021, or at least
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:32.640]  starting to show produced flower or products. And that'll be the best, you know, the best
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:35.680]  judge of character right there is actually see, you know, the proof in the pudding.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:45.120]  Yeah, there's a, there's a good handful of really good producers that I've seen that
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:52.160]  I just jumping on the PIP IG, they really showcase a lot of the growers that are
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:59.200]  utilizing their system. But I mean, the general rule of thumb is maybe what they've seen across
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:06.000]  the board, the idea would essentially be that you're gonna double your production because
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:13.120]  you've doubled your canopy, but the second tier isn't going to be 100%, right? We, we,
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:19.520]  you were just discussing the different pockets as you go up higher. But they say that
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:29.600]  from what they've seen, it's maybe like a 10 to 12% less production than what the bottom lower tier
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:40.640]  is producing every time you go up around. But I mean, really, I think it's just the difficulty of
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:47.520]  I'm not only you know, not only hands on and being able to like train and, and see and make
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:55.040]  sure everything is in that Goldilocks zone of each space is a little more difficult. The higher up
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:05.200]  you go, I agree there. But it's also like being able to create an even consistent environment
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:12.160]  across the canopy too, right? Like, especially if some of those vertical racks, they all push
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:17.600]  together at the end, like, you know, with the rolling benches, how you can pull your aisles
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:24.880]  apart. When nobody's working in there, though, all of those get closed together. So you've got
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:29.440]  like a canopy right in the middle of that. And you know, there's air circulation and
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:35.920]  do you guys run like the hurricane fans like the fans on the walls that blow back and forth in your
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.320]  grow spaces? Is that something that you guys are still using?
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.840]  Oh, yeah, they last forever. As long as you clean those things after every grow.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:51.200]  The Air Kings are those seem to run the best for me.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.160]  Are you?
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.480]  Our dab intermission.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:02.400]  I think this is such a by the way, this is such a cool fucking little thing. You're
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:06.640]  all like situated in that's a cool dab bar. Really cool.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:10.960]  We all we all need one in our in our garage.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.520]  Well, that can be done, sir.
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:16.240]  Right now.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.760]  Oh, I think I can dab. I might have dab stuff.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:27.280]  So what do you think about like as as we're growing higher about this is more maybe a
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:33.440]  metaphysical style question, but the plant isn't as grounded. So yes, when we're growing indoors,
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.680]  that's not as good. So then when we start to take it higher up, that's obviously not as good. And
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.680]  so we're not as good. So we're not as good. So we're not as good. So we're not as good.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:46.640]  So when we're growing indoors, that's not as good. So then when we start to take it higher
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:50.480]  up, that's obviously not as good. And so that's where all the disease comes from.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:56.650]  The less vigor and yield and all that. Is there any truth to that, Layton?
[01:21:59.050 --> 01:22:04.170]  You know, actually, interestingly enough, some people have actually worked on grounding
[01:22:04.170 --> 01:22:10.010]  their plants on tables and racks and have found a difference. I think it was done because
[01:22:10.010 --> 01:22:15.050]  in case you have a electrical discharge, you have to have a grounding similar to the way when you
[01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:22.490]  have a house, they always pound a copper rod down outside the house by the electrical panel
[01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:29.610]  just to prevent any surges. So the people that I talked to that actually did this had a issue that
[01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:36.170]  the building inspector required that they ground the benches, the rolling benches. And then the
[01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:44.410]  ones that they were grounded actually showed a more vigor or a more substantial growth than the
[01:22:44.410 --> 01:22:49.930]  other ones. So there's got to be something to it. I mean, plants were intended to be grown in the
[01:22:49.930 --> 01:22:56.810]  soil, in the ground, not up on a pot and a rolling bench. But, you know, we humans, we do what we do,
[01:22:56.810 --> 01:23:02.170]  right? But no, there's definitely something to it. I can't, I can't, you know, quantify it. I can
[01:23:02.170 --> 01:23:08.410]  just simply say that, yeah, there was a plant reaction that was different. So that, I hope that
[01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:16.810]  answers that question. Yeah. Yeah. I think experience kind of talks more to those kinds
[01:23:16.810 --> 01:23:21.770]  of things where you're not really sure, but you know, you do notice, you do notice overall just
[01:23:21.770 --> 01:23:26.170]  the, the praying leaves at the bottom where you're running everything, but at the top, you know,
[01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:29.450]  seems like they're barely even putting on any growth.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.520]  Well, to be honest, Brian, it's all about plant reaction, right? I mean, that's, that's the only
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:47.200]  way that we can tell that what we're doing is either appropriate or inappropriate until the end.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.680]  And then at the end, you can test it and say, hey, you know, whatever I did during the process,
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:57.600]  you know, was showed a yield, showed a, you know, increase of cannabinoids or
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:02.720]  increase in weight. But in the process, in the middle of it, you don't really have anything that
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:10.080]  you can do, um, short of chemistry testing as sap tissue, leaf tissue. But a lot of people don't
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:14.320]  have time and energy to put into that. So it's really just about looking at the plant and looking
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:18.320]  for plant reaction. And yeah, if the leaves are drooping, you got an issue, if, uh, if they're
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:23.760]  praying and tracking the sun or the light source, then you know, you're on the right path. Um, but
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:28.160]  short of those short of those midterm tests that most people don't do, you don't know where the
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:33.680]  hell you are until the end, you know, until, until you actually fire that shit up, the worker does
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:42.400]  it not right. Yeah. Yeah. So where are you, miss Ron? What part of the state you said you're in?
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:50.720]  So Cal you out West or out East? I'm near Palm Springs. Oh, wow. It gets hot down there.
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:25:02.640]  It's a little hot. You know, we, uh, we can't, we can't grow or do what we do near the water. So,
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:09.920]  uh, you know, before all of this, I was out in like Venice or I had a place out in Redondo
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.560]  beach, but yeah, here I am the desert. Yay.
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:20.400]  What is your, what are the temperature swings like at night?
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:30.880]  So, um, the winter is not bad. I think everybody is like, uh, they come down here, be like all the
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:36.640]  snowbirds will come here. Winter's like, you know, 70, 60, sometimes we get into the fifties, but,
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:45.120]  um, in the summer I've seen is like my first summer out here. So I've seen like 115, 120.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:55.760]  Everything's dry and just so deserty, but you know, um, I don't have PM in my space,
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:02.080]  so I can't really complain. Right, right. There are benefits to both. Um, what is,
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:05.120]  what is the humidity? Like, I got to assume it's pretty dry there as well.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:10.560]  Yeah. I feel like here I can probably tell you right now, I want to say it might be within the
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:18.720]  15%. Sometimes we, I think right now we even have like a high fire risk. So because the humidity is
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:28.160]  so low and we have like a Santa Ana wind event. Hey, one second. I have a puppy who wanted to
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:37.200]  chew on a notepad. Yeah, we just went through those Santa Anas up here for a couple of days
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:44.080]  and it was, it was really hot. I mean, it was, it stayed, you know, 75 degrees at night. So, uh,
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:48.880]  that really does change the thing. And it's, it's interesting. They have a saying out here that the
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:56.000]  Santa Ana is because they come across the desert, um, have a very high ionic state to the, to the
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.800]  air and, and it can kind of like shift your mood either positively or negatively. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:10.640]  Speaking of feeling it extra feeling it, yo, the, there was a solar event. Did you see,
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:17.120]  um, the fricking sun shot off like massive coronal mass ejections. And some of you guys in the North
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:22.640]  I'll get to see the Northern lights. Has any, have you seen them yet? Do you, do you see what I just
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.400]  put up there who just, uh, jumped in the chat? Negative four.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:37.760]  Maybe. Oh, I probably am not even looking at the chat. Oh my gosh. So many people.
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:42.960]  All right. No, no, no. J J. Just look at the screen. Yeah. I was like in private chat.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:50.240]  Grandmaster level. You were just talking about them. So, so cool. Hey guys.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:56.000]  So, Hey Peter, are we going to have our musical interlude this today or you can talk to, uh,
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:04.160]  yeah, well actually I only thought about it like 10 minutes ago. Um, I could ask him. I also have a,
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:12.560]  uh, a, uh, dub producer, uh, who I just asked him, but I doubt that would happen today. But, uh,
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:18.240]  actually so, so next Tuesday, uh, for the, the fire relief fundraiser, we're going to kick it
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:26.800]  off with this band called Boe, um, from Brooklyn. They're going to play out of New York. It's like
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:34.480]  two, you know, a guitarist, a lead singer, a drummer, and a bass player. Uh, so we're going
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:40.720]  to kick it off with some music and, uh, we have some other music things coming, but, uh,
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:47.600]  Benny and the Jets, uh, will be on today, but I will text him and see if he's actually,
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:54.960]  he's awake right now. So let me see, uh, you want to jump on. Sounds exciting.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:03.840]  So anyway, stay tuned. We may have some music. We may not. Yeah. That was really fun when you
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:11.920]  did that though. That was cool. Yeah. Can you, yeah, no, I like, uh, I, I'd love to do it all
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:18.480]  the time. Uh, so that's, that's the goal. Again, we were talking before, like if you don't set
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:25.680]  goals, you never reach them. So, um, but, uh, can you talk about your, your grow setup? Kind of
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:31.600]  like what grow media you're using and are you, you said you like greenhouse, but are you, are you
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:37.440]  you, you said you like greenhouse, but like in your own personal thing, is it indoor? Is it
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:48.960]  outdoor? Is it greenhouse? Is it, um, so I like soil, uh, all of my greenhouse has done in soil,
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:30:00.880]  um, with the new setup, indoor setup. Um, I have been using rock wool. Uh, I think this might be
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:07.280]  my fourth round. Um, you know, the numbers were there, the, the quality is good. I'm, you know,
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:13.920]  I'm smoking it now. Like, and you, you, you get to be picky with what you smoke. Right. So, um,
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:24.480]  I just, uh, I I'm actually, I've been talking with FloraFlex, um, when I run soil, I tried
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:30.720]  Athena, Athena Ag was really great. It was a really good nutrient run. Um, I'm actually going
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:41.040]  to, uh, run FloraFlex again, though, they've got a new, um, full tilt program, uh, which
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:48.480]  did really, really well for me the last time I ran it. And so, um, they, I am not satisfied.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:53.520]  I feel like quality wise, I've produced better quality in soil. So I'm not so
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:02.960]  savvy on what rock wool has done. And I don't really know that I like how not environmentally
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:08.880]  friendly it is, right. It doesn't ever go away or you got to go to extra lengths to recycle it.
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:15.040]  So anyway, um, I'm trying cocoa. I I've done cocoa a couple of times. I've done it on large
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:22.160]  scale. Uh, FloraFlex came out with like a new micro dripper system. So, um, um, I'm excited,
[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:31.120]  but, uh, as far as like what grow medium or how I grow or my grow methodologies, I, I like to
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:42.400]  grow soil and amend it and make sure that it's got a good, uh, beneficial microbial population.
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:50.960]  Um, it just really produces a lot of good, uh, terpenes. Um, you can always yield in all
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:56.960]  environments, but you know, sun grown, you, you get like some UV spectrums that you don't get
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:04.240]  indoor and that really lends a hand and add into the quality of your end product. So I'm just
[01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:10.320]  trying to be kind of well-rounded, you know, I want to be able to, because I, I, while I work
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:19.760]  or mentor with some, some smaller, like grow teams and such, um, I, I don't expect that their
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:27.120]  environment is going to be what works in mine. So it it's been like, you know, uh, always learning,
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:33.440]  right. You never stop learning, um, process of making sure that I can produce or get a couple
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:39.280]  rounds and, you know, I've done like giant pots. I've done small seed green style. This was like
[01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:46.480]  my all spring and summer long up until I think until early January, I'm still going to be in
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:54.240]  rock wool and I'm actually transplanting in cocoa tomorrow. So, um, so yeah, I'm just, uh, all of
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:33:00.320]  the above, right. You got to kind of be well-rounded in your craft. So, uh, but a hundred percent, um,
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:08.640]  sun and soil winners. Well said. And that's a, you know, that's kind of the problem here in Denver
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:13.360]  as well, is there's a lot of people out there that go to work growing in a, you know, a certain
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:19.840]  system, certain ideology, and then come home and, you know, believe that the microbial world is
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:24.320]  where it's at. Um, but it's, you know, they can't get that across to the, to the bosses or the suits
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:30.640]  as we, I don't know how you guys call them, but they call it the chads or the suits. Yeah. A lot
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:36.080]  of those guys don't give a shit. Someone called me a Chad, uh, the other day on Instagram posts.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:47.200]  And I, I was like, little do they know. So, uh, people are the highest insult someone can call
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:55.680]  someone in the world. Yeah. Hey, let's talk a little bit more about your hybrid greenhouse,
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:00.480]  because you know, that's, that's always been a big thought in my mind is to have the best of
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:06.080]  both worlds. You can control humidity, you can control temperature, you can control sunlight,
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:11.520]  and you can supplement sunlight and you can plant in soil. So it's like, in my mind, probably the,
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:16.720]  one of the best ways to grow, especially in the future where we have extreme weather, let's face
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:21.360]  it, we get no fucking rain and then we get 10 inches of rain in one day, you know, and how do
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:26.400]  you deal with that outside? Right. So, but with a greenhouse, you can control all that shit.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:37.440]  So let's hit on that one. So, um, yeah, I feel like when, in terms of cultivating,
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:52.560]  um, any, any where or how you grow, you're always gonna have the potential to produce
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:35:00.960]  an A+++, a lot of it is genetics. Also second to that is going to be like your environmentals,
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:06.800]  like your humidity, how much light, how often or how much water. Um, with cocoa, I'm really
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:16.080]  going to try to push my steer, uh, crop steering abilities, um, because it's so with rockwool,
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:22.400]  if a cube dries out, part of the rockwool cube suddenly becomes
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:28.800]  enabled to inhabit roots anymore. It becomes hydrophobic. So, um, I didn't like that.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:40.240]  Cocoa, we're able to create a, an environment, um, in the soil with microbiology as well.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:48.720]  But the thing is, is it's got a different dry down than soil. Right. So, uh,
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:57.200]  so that's a side subject, but anyway, so no matter what, you'll, you'll always have the potential
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:04.960]  to produce good crops, but in a greenhouse, there's nothing
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:15.440]  at all that can touch what the sun can do. Yes, we can produce really good cro- I'm producing
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:22.080]  really good crops and yield under double-endeds right now in an indoor environment. And I'm still
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:33.040]  saying that if you had said double-endeds or said LEDs, cause some of these LEDs right now on the
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:42.080]  market are fire, especially grandmaster level. He's working with, um, Samsung. Samsung's making
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:49.840]  sure that that, that lighting company anyway, so it's about, it's about environmentals, um,
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:56.080]  and what you're providing the plant. So if you took those lights and put them in a greenhouse,
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:08.740]  then say like a whole 63 days, right. Um, not every, like you, like you said, not every,
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:17.780]  not every day is going to be sunny, a hundred percent, like 10 UV coming through, like not
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:23.540]  humid. You know what I'm saying? Some places are phenomenal. Some places have microclimates like
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:31.140]  San Diego mountains is a great agricultural microclimate and like San Luis Obispo up into
[01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:37.460]  Monterey County, phenomenal agro, but there's still days when clouds exist because it's nature,
[01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:44.740]  right? So the ability to turn those lights on and be able to like, because those lights produce heat,
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:50.420]  you know, you're, you're able to exhaust out what you need to exhaust and you can turn water walls
[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:57.860]  on and off to add humidity because humidity is super important. And, and I mean like, uh, so,
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:02.500]  so you think about as far as watering the, the tip of my joint keeps wanting to come out. I just got
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:09.700]  to roll another one. So, um, so then you think of in terms of like watering, right? Water is super
[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:16.900]  important when we're growing plants. Uh, if you have an 80 foot long greenhouse, which is a pretty
[01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:23.700]  80 foot, a hundred foot, 120 is even like gnarlier. Um, you really got to take into consideration that
[01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:32.020]  the, uh, plants in the middle of that hoop. Also if the greenhouses are facing the right
[01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:37.860]  direction in terms of the sun rising and falling, right? Because if you have it facing north and
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:42.980]  south, then the sun's going to just be beating on the greenhouse the whole time versus, um,
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:50.900]  the other way around. So, so really it's, it's in terms of how long your space is, the plants in the
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:57.300]  middle of the greenhouse are going to get much warmer than at the end, closer to the water wall
[01:38:57.300 --> 01:39:07.140]  and at the end, closer to the exhaust fan because of the length that the air you're trying to cycle
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:11.460]  through the greenhouse has to travel. Unless you've got like the ridge vent fans, but not all
[01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:17.780]  of us have that kind of bread to drop ridge vent fans. So props to those guys who get to play in
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:24.660]  those. Right. But, um, it's about air circulation. So if you can essentially not run your water lines
[01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:32.500]  all the way down, because not every plant down the length of the greenhouse is going to uptake water
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:40.020]  the same versus like running it side to side because plants closer to the exhaust fans
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:43.860]  and the water walls are going to drink differently because they're in a more
[01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:50.820]  favorable environment than the hot stark of the middle of a greenhouse. So, so it's always about
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:55.940]  controlling your environment. You just really put these plants really love consistency.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:40:01.780]  They can take in a lot of fucking light, really. They're high level light plants. So, um,
[01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:10.420]  if you can provide that and hit like the marks properly, you're going to produce, but
[01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:17.540]  greenhouse because of all of the spectrum that the sun provides and greenhouse because of the UV
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:24.580]  rays and greenhouse because plants grown in a greenhouse are just so much better.
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:31.140]  So, you know, there's my take on greenhouse.
[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:35.060]  As long as you can control the environment. Right.
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.820]  And when you're talking greenhouse, everything that you're doing is like light debt.
[01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:47.300]  Yeah. Yeah. Because otherwise if you're going to grow it full term and you're going to grow
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:55.940]  monster fucking plants, I don't, I feel like, um, that's not the beat for a space that's
[01:40:56.660 --> 01:41:05.220]  able to be burned and turned every four to five times a year, six, if you're really fucking good,
[01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:13.540]  you know? So, so, uh, yeah, don't, don't go full term. If you can get that shit, definitely not.
[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:19.860]  Cause I mean, it's about utilizing the space that you have properly. I wouldn't grow monster
[01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:27.940]  plants in an indoor space either, because you can literally, it's about filling the square footprint.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:32.500]  You know what I'm saying? Like if you only have fucking a four by eight table, you better make
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:39.940]  sure that your four by eight tables filled every like square foot, every six inches or so. So that
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:48.260]  way you're really utilizing the space that the, uh, light you're running is, um, providing
[01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:56.020]  efficient usable light. Right. It's about whatever space you're in from 10 to 3,500 square foot
[01:41:56.020 --> 01:42:00.420]  greenhouse. Now like the 10,000 square foot greenhouses. I don't really know that jam.
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:04.820]  That's a lot. That's too not hands-on for me. You know, that's big.
[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:07.540]  What's the biggest girls you guys have been in?
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:15.540]  10, 10 K. That was the one we were managing for sure. Could you see end to end?
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:21.140]  Well, they're broken. The rooms are broken up. It's not just, Oh,
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:27.940]  see there's greenhouses that are wide open out here that are like whole half acre fucking spaces
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:28.500]  pumping them out.
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:34.660]  But just again, your temperature and everything in California is just, I mean,
[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:40.420]  almost built for that. We're in Colorado. We gotta, uh, we know our limitations.
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:48.500]  Being conscientious of the environment. Yeah. Yeah. Super cool. So many ways to do it. Right.
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:50.580]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:55.140]  Tyler, I see you.
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:04.340]  Family tree seeds. I'm, uh, so instead of, since we have,
[01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:13.140]  Oh, wait, I think I forgot to ask Benny. That was my bad. I know I did ask him 14 minutes ago. He
[01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:19.140]  hasn't responded, but, uh, instead of music, I think we can do a, uh, a giveaway of something.
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:26.420]  So sir Lancelot is, uh, digging through his, uh, stash of things we could give away and hopefully
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:32.580]  he'll be on any minute. So sir, Lance a lot. That's his name. Uh, that's what I call him.
[01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:41.780]  His real name, his birth name is Lance. That's a good, uh, username. Yes. But, uh, no, Lance is
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:50.820]  not in the, uh, he's not lurking in the chat, but, um, what, what I want to do is, is between the
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:58.580]  five of us, uh, think of a good trivia question that we could ask. Cause that's my limiting
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:02.740]  factors. Every time it pops into my head that we could do a giveaway, I'm like,
[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:07.300]  we need a good trivia question to go with that. And I always go back to,
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:17.380]  I was thinking of a, uh, of a Boston sports, uh, old school trivia question, but then it's probably
[01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:23.460]  only Boston people who would maybe know the answer, but, uh, anyway, think about that.
[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:27.540]  Everyone marinate on that for a minute and, uh, carry on with the conversation.
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:35.060]  I have some like dope, really super soft hemp shirts too. We can throw in whatever said giveaway.
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:40.180]  Ooh, or we could do a separate giveaway. We could do, actually I'm wearing a hemp, uh,
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:44.180]  it's an Alpine hemp, uh, shirt.
[01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:47.460]  I'm going to have to send you mine and I'll bet you mine's softer.
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:57.300]  You've talked shit about Colorado and now you're talking shit about other hemp, uh,
[01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:59.940]  t-shirt companies. I'm just saying.
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:08.660]  Yeah. Trent, Trent, Trent is a, does not want sports trivia, but it's a,
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:11.700]  I like my old school sports trivia.
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:16.900]  Everybody's saying, Hey, let's bounce on the core. Hey,
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:20.020]  Miss Rad, what kind of core are you using? Whose, whose core products are you using?
[01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:28.740]  In terms of cocoa? Yeah. Um, so FloraFlex came out with a new
[01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:39.780]  new blend that isn't super fine, like cocoa medium. It's not like chunky, but it's just not
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:47.700]  fine. So it doesn't hold so much water, like over waterish ability, you know, field capacity.
[01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:57.140]  So, um, that is the, I've ran in, um, charcoal before. Um, that was pretty cool. Uh, and
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:06.180]  Pro-Mix is kind of peak cocoa-y, no, right. But it's not, it's, I feel like I would consider
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:13.380]  Pro-Mix more of a, of an inert, like hydro medium over a soil medium, right?
[01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:19.700]  Yes. As far as I know, just cocoa and they claim there's a bunch of microbes and stuff in there.
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:24.420]  Super compressed and makes you feel like a champion if you can lift it.
[01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:32.180]  Just kidding. Well, we got, you know what, if you're interested, we should get you out some,
[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:36.980]  uh, pit moss with core. That combination is amazing. I played with it this spring.
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:44.660]  Yeah. I dumped a whole bunch of pit moss in the rate, in the four by four bed I'm setting up
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:50.420]  right now. And then afterwards you started talking about it with the core. So then I told them, I was
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:57.540]  like, Leighton's all big on the core, like mixture. Um, would you, do you, do you, Leighton,
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:01.780]  do you like the core mixture versus just the straight pit moss and why?
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:09.300]  Um, I like the core because the core that they're using is not from the far East.
[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:15.620]  It's actually produced right in Mexico. I've met the gentleman that makes it. Um, and he does not
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:22.740]  over compress it. So when he puts it in his bagging or bailing system, he only uses about
[01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:30.740]  two pounds of pressure per square foot. Um, so it's, it limits to, like she said about the PM,
[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:34.980]  it's so heavier, the pro mix is so heavy. You got to lift it. You got to Hercules it right?
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:40.580]  Well, that's because they've pressed it so hard. But what happens is when you press cocoa fibers,
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:46.420]  you crush them and you talk about those fines, the fines are a nightmare to work with. So what
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:51.540]  he does is he actually presses only to two pounds per square foot. So the bags aren't as heavy,
[01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:59.860]  but he doesn't fuck up the fiber. And what that cocoa fiber has is, is a high level of potassium.
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:05.460]  And it's, it's not fast release potassium. It's, it's only going to release. If you have the right
[01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:12.420]  microbial communities to do the work for you, um, it breaks down very slow. So you get a, a
[01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:19.940]  longer transition into aggregation. Um, whereas like the just straight, um, pit moss tends to
[01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:25.300]  lump and clump and break down a faster than the core does. So the core really
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:29.380]  kind of stabilizes everything until you can get those aggregates to form.
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:38.180]  Um, and it's just, I think overall, you know, aeration, potassium, uh, other micro nutrients,
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:43.780]  a slow breakdown, water storage capacity, you know, it's just a win-win, you know, and that,
[01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:49.300]  that was based on both my understanding and playing with soils for years, but actually
[01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:54.100]  testing it here, uh, in California, I did two different runs with it, um, starting in about
[01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:59.940]  April of this year. So that's why I ended up loving the core, core version. I think they
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:04.420]  call it cocoa complete if the listeners want to see it and just go to pit moss.
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:15.380]  Let, let me just quickly do our, our, our giveaway segment of the conversation. The
[01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:21.220]  new segment in the, in the conversation is the product give me a giveaway and standing by was
[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:29.620]  product is Sir Lancelot. What is happening? Also live from Southern California.
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:36.340]  Very much. How are you? Good, good, great conversation guys. I would love to have you
[01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:42.420]  all on the show. This is awesome. But yeah, we do have a quick interruption for a giveaway and a
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:48.580]  stoked to actually have this week's giveaway. The, a Cali bomb from peacemaker. Uh, this thing,
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:52.820]  I can prove close in the dark. I don't think it's dark enough right now and in my office to share
[01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:58.180]  that. Uh, but the Cali is a nice unit on the go. If you want to keep your glass safe at home. And I
[01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:03.060]  know anyone that has a war like me, that's the first thing you think of is not breaking some of
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:08.660]  your best products. So the Cali is kind of nice in the fact that beyond being glow in the dark,
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:16.500]  um, you have a obviously quick snapper access in there and have a little cap, which happens to be
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:21.940]  the same size as a beverage bottle. So it's something that has dual purpose. Uh, nice thing
[01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:26.340]  about these as far as cleaning as well. Since most of us that use glass get frustrated in that
[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:31.220]  department, you can literally throw this in the freezer when it gets too gunked up, take it out,
[01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:36.660]  break it up. And sure enough, all that gun comes out. So a very nice for on the go. Again, I use
[01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:41.700]  it for going camping, going boarding anywhere where I don't want to have to worry about losing
[01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:48.100]  my glass. So I think we do have a pop quiz question, correct? Peter, uh, for, okay. So,
[01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:54.500]  so yeah. And, and other people can Google this and it is going to be a sports question. And then
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:51:01.220]  when we do, when we do your hemp shirt, we can do a non-sports question. So in the eighties,
[01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:09.620]  what is, and just the first person to type this into the chat. So in the eighties, a, uh, and I
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:18.980]  grew up playing hockey. So a Boston Bruins player was paralyzed. What was his name or what is his
[01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:26.420]  name? Let's see this question. Oh, it's a good one. Layton. Do you remember this? What don't
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:30.660]  answer it by the way. I was going to say Peter, where's the music? You got to go ding, ding.
[01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:38.340]  I know it is not Wayne Gretzky. He did not play for the Bruins and it's not Larry Bird.
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:43.780]  Good God. There are a bunch of Boston people watching too.
[01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:50.180]  A lot of them. No, I don't remember. All you got to do is when not Travis Roy,
[01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:57.860]  he did not play for the Bruins. He played for BU. Oh my God. We have a winner. Johnny HB.
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:51:59.860]  Johnny HB.
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:15.140]  Okay. So Johnny, I will, uh, let me put my email in and you can email me and we'll,
[01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:19.860]  Lance, we'll get that shipped out shortly. And if we can thank you. So do you want to
[01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:28.820]  give something away? Yeah, I've got a couple of hemp shirts, um, up for grabs, up for grabs.
[01:52:28.820 --> 01:52:35.220]  Definitely. Okay. So let's, um, does anybody have a good trivia question ready to go?
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:44.500]  And it can be a super easy one. How about something that people who follow you on IG would know?
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:53:01.460]  Oh, okay. Um, right. Are we ready? Yeah. What hashtag am I known for most? What hashtag
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:09.860]  am I most known for? And then can you see the comments? Yeah. Yeah.
[01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:19.700]  Okay. This is where we need our, um, jeopardy music. We can hum it along too.
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:27.220]  Okay. And let, let me put my email in the, uh, chat.
[01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:33.620]  While they're figuring that out, Johnny HB, your $45 retail value bong. As soon as I get that
[01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:37.620]  address, it'll get out in the mail. And being that you're only a few hours away from me,
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:41.700]  I am venturing to guess that we can get this to you by the weekend. Definitely to you before
[01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:48.420]  Christmas. That's for sure. So did he, did he say where he is? Well, Johnny, I'm going to assume he
[01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:55.220]  had, he had a screenshot of the Huntington beach pier and he had HB in his name. So that's a little
[01:53:55.220 --> 01:54:01.700]  trivia that I'm guessing on that. He is based out of surf city, USA, Huntington beach, California
[01:54:01.780 --> 01:54:08.420]  in O V. You would make a good detective. I was a criminal justice major in college and many people
[01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:13.700]  in this industry still tease me about that. But you know, you know what the other guys are thinking
[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:24.980]  is my response to that. Okay. So has anybody gotten the hashtag yet? Yes. I see a one, two,
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:36.500]  three. Right now three people who have it. So I'm down to like, send that out to y'all three.
[01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:41.460]  And what was the hashtag? Hashtag is colors of cannabis.
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:46.900]  Wow. That's a good one. Mine's cannabis community everywhere. I'm always hashtagging cannabis
[01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:55.700]  but I like that. All right. That's cool. All right. So for those three people, you can
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:55:08.180]  also email me and I'll pass it along. Yeah. Let me make sure. Let me scroll. But so quick question
[01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:16.260]  too. When we're done with this, I had a question about growth on cocoa. How do you like the growth
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:24.900]  that we see on cocoa on the charcoal? Yeah. Should we get back to our regularly scheduled
[01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:31.220]  programming and talk to cocoa, which is where we left off? Sure. Lance, super fucking awesome of
[01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:36.100]  you to like give that away though. That thing looks so dope. Oh my God. These are, I'm telling
[01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:40.180]  you people tease on silicone. I mean, it's not just something to cook your or bake your banana
[01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:44.660]  nut bread in. I know people rip on it. You know, I've got some nice glass sitting around, but my
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:48.580]  gosh, this stuff is awesome for on the road. I'm telling you guys, no matter if you're up at Pismo
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:54.580]  beach on the sand or up at a big bear, I mean, it is, you can't beat it. Same with their little,
[01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:58.180]  they have a little pipe. So we give it away too, as we count down the days to Christmas here and
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:56:02.100]  people will have more details there, but we definitely have plenty more to give away. Thank
[01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:06.580]  you guys for letting me crash in on the show and have this little giveaway break. It's both on
[01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:10.500]  those hem shirts too. Thanks for giving those away. That was pretty fun. Thank you. Thank you.
[01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:18.100]  All right, Lance. I'll check in with you after the show and we have the Lance Lambert show coming
[01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:21.540]  soon, right? That is correct. Yeah. A little international flavor.
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:30.580]  Literally as soon as Lance schedules it. So no pressure. We're all waiting on you just to pick
[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:36.180]  somebody you want to talk shop with. Yeah. To get a little bit of preview. We have people in the
[01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:42.340]  pipeline from Australia, Thailand, all across Europe and South America that are queued up to
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:47.220]  get on the show. So we'll have something good for you guys again, just in time before the Christmas
[01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:51.220]  holiday, I promise. So more to come on that, but thank you again for having you guys. Great
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:56.180]  conversations as always. We will be catching up with you very soon. All right. See you Lance.
[01:56:56.180 --> 01:56:59.460]  Thanks Lance. How cool.
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:06.020]  Look at that. We may not have music today, but we have giveaways. And I always forget about
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:12.900]  giveaways. So I could give a lot of stuff away. I have like all these grassroots things I'm looking
[01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:19.860]  at. Anyway, we'll do those next time. All right. So you guys were talking Coco.
[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:23.860]  Yes, Leighton. I would love to know.
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:26.980]  There we go. What was the question? Because you scratched out.
[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:34.260]  So I was wondering how do you like the performance of Coco versus like say growing in soil,
[01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:38.980]  maybe like a two, three, four, five gallon pot of soil versus Coco.
[01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:45.140]  To be honest with you, anytime I start playing with those soilless mediums,
[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:51.860]  I always go to a horizontal soil system. So I mix a four part,
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:58.580]  sand, silk, clay, and organic matter that I put underneath the soilless medium. Coco
[01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:04.340]  core would be considered a soilless medium just to regulate the moisture. The problem with any of
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:09.860]  those soilless mediums are is they tend to go hydrophobic on the outside and anaerobic on the
[01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:17.540]  inside. And that's just because of the nature of the beast. The soilless mediums do not
[01:58:18.020 --> 01:58:26.180]  tend to hold the moisture or regulate it as much as a natural soil would. So I'm a hybrid guy. So
[01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:31.780]  I would all be about putting that layer in underneath to manage the moisture level of the
[01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:38.980]  soilless medium. And I'd also encourage a really good living green mulch so that we prevent that
[01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:44.100]  trans-evaporation from happening on that soil surface.
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:45.140]  I hope that answers.
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:55.460]  It definitely confirms the need for good air exchange and a good micro
[01:58:56.260 --> 01:59:04.500]  biological population to help deliver the transport systems along to the root system.
[01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:07.620]  So yeah, it'll be my pleasure.
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:08.100]  Where's the root?
[01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:08.420]  I'm sorry?
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:08.820]  I'm sorry.
[01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:09.300]  No, no, no.
[01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:24.340]  Oh, I was just saying it'll be my first real larger scale go at cocoa. So I'm excited.
[01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:27.460]  What is the reason why you're-
[01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:28.100]  Are you doing that right there in the desert?
[01:59:31.220 --> 01:59:31.860]  Sorry, what?
[01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:34.820]  Sorry, Leighton.
[01:59:34.820 --> 01:59:39.460]  Leighton, do you see that question?
[01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:45.140]  Yes, I see that question. That would be considered a soilless medium right there.
[01:59:45.860 --> 01:59:54.580]  It's half cocoa, half compost, half aeration. So again, it's a great system. It works best with
[01:59:54.580 --> 02:00:02.660]  just nutrients, bottled nutrients of some form. Because what happens is that medium allows for
[02:00:02.660 --> 02:00:11.300]  that nutrient to be held in situ, in location for the plant roots. But if you're all about using
[02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:17.300]  the microbes to feed the plant, as well as nutrients, whether they're organic or inorganic,
[02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:23.060]  then it's less so. It doesn't have as much value because there's nowhere for the saprophytics
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:28.980]  to mine. There's nothing for the mycorrhizae to lock on. Again, if this is pots and you're
[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:34.980]  one and done, then don't waste your time with all of this thought. But if this is a bed that
[02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:39.780]  you're building that you're never going to change, then you're kind of crazy just to go with a
[02:00:39.780 --> 02:00:46.580]  soilless medium. Unfortunately, what happens is that soil, as it breaks down, the fines move
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:52.260]  through the profile down to the bottom of the pot and you end up with this muck on the very bottom,
[02:00:52.260 --> 02:00:57.300]  which is anaerobic. So when the roots get all the way down there and hit that, then they have
[02:00:57.300 --> 02:01:02.980]  issues. You could have alcohol production, you can have the root tips melting, you can have
[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:10.180]  disease starting to attack your roots. And again, these are all taking away from your plant potential.
[02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:16.580]  You want your plants to be living in the best possible environment with no known source of
[02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:23.460]  anaerobic pockets. It's inevitable to happen in soil systems, but you don't have this whole layer
[02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:29.620]  of it, which is what happens with the soils medium grown repeatedly in over the years.
[02:01:30.180 --> 02:01:37.300]  And also you have to top dress because that soils medium is going to lose depth. Now, eventually
[02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:42.900]  you're going to have roots that are holding that soil system, that soilless system together,
[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:48.660]  which will help, you know, again with trans evaporation, gas exchange and all that.
[02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:52.660]  But again, it's not going to last forever. It's sooner or later you're going to have to replace
[02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:57.780]  it. Whereas if you get into the horizontal soil systems, they're going to last forever. I mean,
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:03.700]  a thousand years, 10,000 years, who knows before you'll ever have to change it. That's way more
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:10.260]  than we can worry about. Well, blue and Maine is getting to the question that I've been kind
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:17.780]  of thinking about a lot, which is, you know, what is the replacement for that aeration or water
[02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:26.660]  retention? You know, pit moss is an example. I know Delano, you know, is talking about palm
[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:32.100]  fronds, which are super sustainable because they grow everywhere in Florida through the
[02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:40.820]  Sunbelt all the way to California. So what are your thoughts on things that could replace peat?
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:51.940]  All right. Things to replace peat, cocoa, paper mulches, palm lawns. There's forest products,
[02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:59.700]  which are basically barks that are chipped up. All of those things are readily available out
[02:02:59.700 --> 02:03:05.220]  there in the market. You just got to do your research. But I really personally like pit moss
[02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:12.980]  for a number of reasons. They are using a waste stream that the wood pulp and chip industry,
[02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:19.380]  they're actually taking down trees to produce their products where, you know, and again,
[02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:23.300]  I'm not a big fan of like taking away from something. I think we've done too much of that
[02:03:23.300 --> 02:03:31.220]  in the past. So harvesting trees to make soil is kind of like harvesting fish to make fish food.
[02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:36.500]  So you can grow fish. You're kind of like defeating the purpose here. So again, that's why
[02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:41.700]  I'm a big fan of pit moss, because they're taking waste stream that would ordinarily get thrown
[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:48.020]  into a landfill, causing all kinds of other issues. And they're grinding that up as a substitute for
[02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:55.380]  peat moss. And if any of you heard me, I am a big hater on peat moss because it's so detrimental to
[02:03:55.380 --> 02:04:00.100]  the environment. It took thousands of years for those bogs to form. It's going to take thousands
[02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:05.940]  of years for them to form again, if ever, because, you know, again, we have so much influence on the
[02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:11.380]  surface of the earth now that the chances of those things being allowed to happen without any
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:18.260]  human impact is null. I mean, we've already dammed up all the streams and rivers and things that
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:24.180]  would cause a peat bog to happen. So again, I'm sorry. Don't mean to rant on that one.
[02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:27.540]  We like rants.
[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:28.580]  Yeah, yeah. It needs to be.
[02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:34.660]  It needs to be brought to it. Same with a lot of the guanos and stuff. A lot of the meals, they
[02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:40.500]  are not super environmental friendly towards harvesting or how they get them, obtain them,
[02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:40.820]  you know?
[02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:42.180]  Yeah.
[02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:51.620]  So Leighton Florinogs asked, have you done a full cycle? Like I wanted to bring pit moss on
[02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:58.020]  at some point. And I told, what's her name?
[02:04:58.020 --> 02:04:58.900]  Ashley.
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:06.100]  Ashley, that I wanted to at least like start growing in it and then bring their leads,
[02:05:06.100 --> 02:05:10.020]  their mad scientist on or whoever the kind of person.
[02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:10.660]  Oh, Charles.
[02:05:10.660 --> 02:05:10.980]  Yeah.
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:11.380]  Charles.
[02:05:11.380 --> 02:05:16.420]  Which I think would be cool. But so can you talk about your experience with it?
[02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:23.140]  Absolutely. I have not done a full run. I mean, I grew, I've been growing plants in it since
[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:30.980]  this spring. But I know that they have had a couple, I know one for sure that pit moss has,
[02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:36.740]  and it's on their website, who a cannabis cultivator who did at least one full run.
[02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:40.500]  And I'm pretty sure they're on their second run or maybe the third run by now
[02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:46.980]  using that material and just that material. Now, I have no idea whether that was a synthetically
[02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:54.180]  driven nutrient system or a more super soil type system with biology. So that's something you'll
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:59.700]  have to look up. But the study, I'm pretty positive has been posted up on their website.
[02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:05.860]  And there was definitely added benefit to using that material. When I originally started working
[02:06:05.860 --> 02:06:12.340]  with, with Mott Hadley back in, I don't know, 14, 15, the formulation was to,
[02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:16.980]  the biology just set up shop on the paper and didn't want anything to do, did not want to
[02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:24.500]  associate with the plant. And I know Dr. Charles Bethke, otherwise lovingly referred to as dog,
[02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:31.060]  went through three years of reformulation to get to the where they are or where they were this
[02:06:31.060 --> 02:06:37.060]  spring when Ashley reached out to me. And again, I tried it. I was thrilled with it. I did three,
[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:43.060]  I did three to two different complete runs. One was just a grass seed and water only. The other
[02:06:43.060 --> 02:06:52.980]  was grass seed biology. And the best one was the core. It really provided an instant home for the
[02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:58.980]  microbial community to establish itself. And the plant reaction was undeniable. It really outperformed
[02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:06.980]  all the other ones. Got it. All right. Well, that's a future conversation that
[02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:14.020]  I'm psyched to have because I'll actually be growing it. So there we go. Well, Hey, maybe we
[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:19.540]  can have them come on in early January. I know we're going to, I think we have our next week's
[02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:28.260]  guest all set up, Brian. Not confirmed, but I hope so. I confirmed it before you. So next weekend,
[02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:35.220]  we're going to have a Wendy Kornberg, Kornberg, son of this one. And then we're going to take a
[02:07:35.220 --> 02:07:41.300]  break for Christmas. Then we're going to have a new year's Eve party on the Thursday, the 31st.
[02:07:41.860 --> 02:07:48.420]  So we'll have Ashley and maybe Doc and Brian come on as guests early in January. I'll reach out to
[02:07:48.420 --> 02:08:01.560]  them today. Cool. You guys want to answer some rapid fire questions and then call it a day so I
[02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:08.360]  can go. Yeah, definitely. Definitely open it up. All right. Let me, so ask your questions.
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:11.560]  And then there were some from like when we first started. So let me just,
[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:19.000]  so Ms. Rad, are you clone only or do you do pop beans too?
[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:22.920]  Popping beans is the way.
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:29.960]  Is there a reason why you're not growing in soil?
[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:34.120]  I grow in soil in the greenhouse. Oh, wait, who did you say that to?
[02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:37.320]  To you. Oh yeah. I'm still in soil.
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:39.320]  But I'm saying with the...
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:58.680]  So right now I am trying to work on how quickly I can dry down a crop cycle throughout the day.
[02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:08.840]  And I feel like in soil, I won't be able to do that as efficiently as in a more
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:17.000]  air friendly, like, you know, you don't want anaerobic, you want aerobic, right? So I just
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:25.160]  already know that I can produce in soil and I'm already doing it in a nice little space,
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:30.840]  patio style. And hey! Standing coma just...
[02:09:40.270 --> 02:09:51.070]  All right. As you were saying. Yeah. I feel like I am just aware of how much more efficient
[02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:59.710]  some of the other mediums might be in said space. So I'm seeing how I fare in cocoa. And
[02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:05.550]  I don't know. I just don't want to transplant soil into my greenhouse, or I'm sorry, into my
[02:10:05.550 --> 02:10:12.990]  indoor because I have these tables that flood and it goes into a drain and I don't want to deal with
[02:10:12.990 --> 02:10:17.790]  like floating perlite, you know what I'm saying? So I just don't want to deal with it yet until I
[02:10:18.670 --> 02:10:26.350]  like absolutely am like, all right, we almost did. But, you know, I was chatting with the owner
[02:10:27.070 --> 02:10:34.830]  of Floraflex and a couple of really key producers and they have absolutely given me faith that I'll
[02:10:34.830 --> 02:10:41.550]  be able to produce as well. So here I go. But I mean, I can always go back to soil. Yeah.
[02:10:41.790 --> 02:10:48.590]  Hey, I had a question for you. So you're talking about dry down. Like I'm working with a number of
[02:10:48.590 --> 02:10:58.350]  guys right now who are talking about epigenetic steering through the use of drying down. Is that
[02:10:58.350 --> 02:11:01.630]  what you were referring to? Are you playing in that world too?
[02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:10.590]  I mean, in that in context of what I just touched on, it's like if, for example, we had
[02:11:11.470 --> 02:11:17.470]  the dry down as far as like after you water a medium and it hits field capacity, you're not
[02:11:17.470 --> 02:11:24.590]  going to have as much oxygen in the root zone. So you want it to dry down, not too much, right?
[02:11:25.150 --> 02:11:30.350]  Just enough of a dry down and then you are rehydrating the medium and hey,
[02:11:31.470 --> 02:11:37.710]  and you're rehydrating the medium and going at it again. Because essentially it's kind of like if
[02:11:37.710 --> 02:11:47.150]  you say, say I'm the soil pot, I'm the three gallon soil pot that has a good, nice root system
[02:11:47.950 --> 02:12:00.030]  and you're the like six inch cube or the two gallon cocoa cube. You know what I'm saying?
[02:12:00.030 --> 02:12:06.830]  Just the, what you imagine when you think of hydro medium. What happens is, is if I get watered
[02:12:07.710 --> 02:12:16.110]  like my half a gallon or something and you get watered your like 600 mils or whatever it is,
[02:12:17.070 --> 02:12:25.390]  by nature your design is to need to get water again, like pretty quickly. Like, you know,
[02:12:25.390 --> 02:12:30.590]  maybe you're watering two times a day, three times a day, depends on how big the plant is or how
[02:12:30.590 --> 02:12:37.150]  small your feedings are. But what's happening is, is when I get my half a gallon, cause you know,
[02:12:37.150 --> 02:12:42.510]  you, you try to water with runoff and soil, like a lot of people push or promote like 10 to 20%,
[02:12:43.470 --> 02:12:46.590]  make sure you're running off. So that way you don't get a buildup. Right.
[02:12:48.510 --> 02:12:54.110]  The thing is, is it's going to take, depending on the temperature of the space, right. It's
[02:12:54.110 --> 02:13:00.510]  going to take about a day or two before I'm ready for water again. So if three hours,
[02:13:00.510 --> 02:13:06.590]  six hours after our feeding that we both had at the same time, if I get hungry for magnesium,
[02:13:06.670 --> 02:13:13.070]  I'm waiting 48 hours, unless you're foliar spraying, I'm waiting 48 hours until you give
[02:13:13.070 --> 02:13:23.150]  me magnesium. Whereas you being cocoa or rockwool, you're only magnesium hungry for like six hours.
[02:13:23.150 --> 02:13:28.990]  So, you know, things just happen faster. You're delivering what the plant wants quicker.
[02:13:29.710 --> 02:13:37.470]  And, that's why, wait, there was a reason why we were talking about this. What's the,
[02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:42.750]  how does that loop back around? So it loops back around by steering.
[02:13:42.750 --> 02:13:50.670]  So, plan distresses, micro stresses, or even greater stresses where you like,
[02:13:50.670 --> 02:13:56.590]  I think what you said was, you know, you water till you hit capacity plus 10 to 20%. So that,
[02:13:56.670 --> 02:14:01.870]  you know, you've hit a soil saturation and then you're letting it swing the other way to,
[02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:07.710]  to a complete aeration. And that's something that I think most people don't really talk about is
[02:14:07.710 --> 02:14:15.230]  that the physical properties of soil is only 50% of sand, silk, clay, and organic matter.
[02:14:15.230 --> 02:14:22.590]  The other 50% is oxygen and water. So if you have soil physics, 50% physical soil
[02:14:22.590 --> 02:14:28.910]  and the other 50% water, well, you're anaerobic. And of course the opposite, if you're 50% air,
[02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:33.870]  you're anaerobic or you're almost arid because there's no moisture left in it.
[02:14:33.870 --> 02:14:37.870]  So that was the interesting thing with these, with these couple of engineers I'm playing with
[02:14:38.590 --> 02:14:46.270]  on how they are using water only as a method to steering. And this goes on to,
[02:14:47.150 --> 02:14:52.990]  it can be done with nutrients as well. But I'm really loving this guy's approach because he's
[02:14:52.990 --> 02:14:58.670]  focused on water. And then once you've got your water to a point where you, you're steering the
[02:14:58.670 --> 02:15:05.070]  plant, so you're, you're not having these huge over waterlogged, dry down, over waterlogged,
[02:15:05.070 --> 02:15:11.230]  dry down, you're having a leveler way to steer it. And then you add the nutrients and after.
[02:15:11.230 --> 02:15:15.710]  So that's why I was asking, because it's just, it seems to be a really hot topic right now.
[02:15:16.750 --> 02:15:22.990]  It's cool that you say genetics wise, like they're, they're, as far as, I mean, in what
[02:15:22.990 --> 02:15:29.710]  aspect genetics wise are we talking about with steering and like how well something.
[02:15:32.510 --> 02:15:38.430]  So we all know that we all know there's potential in the plant, right? We've picked this cultivar
[02:15:39.230 --> 02:15:45.870]  because we either like what it does or we like the way or whatever it produces on a certain level
[02:15:46.350 --> 02:15:52.430]  that other plants don't. So how do you get that to express? Like, how do you, this, this particular
[02:15:52.430 --> 02:15:59.950]  plant has this amazing lemon bomb expression, right? How do you encourage that lemonade to
[02:15:59.950 --> 02:16:05.150]  really come out at its fullest potential? And that's done through steering, whether it's a
[02:16:05.150 --> 02:16:10.910]  stress steering, a water steering or a nutrient steering. And, you know, in past it was all about,
[02:16:10.910 --> 02:16:17.390]  we'll stress the plant to get the most THC. Well, as we're learning, as we're getting more and more
[02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:21.870]  familiar with this plant and more and more colleges are testing it and more and more
[02:16:21.870 --> 02:16:27.070]  information is coming out, but that's not necessarily the best way to do it. I mean,
[02:16:27.070 --> 02:16:34.350]  I've smoked some 17% that just took my head off. And then I've smoked some 32% THC that I was
[02:16:34.350 --> 02:16:41.230]  kind of like, eh, you know, that's, that's okay. So I think that whole like entourage effect of,
[02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:47.310]  of cannabis, cannabinoids, cannabinoids, and terpenes and terpenoids is the key to the future
[02:16:47.310 --> 02:16:53.710]  of, of where this plant gets taken. And the only way to do that is, is to really, again,
[02:16:53.710 --> 02:16:59.550]  stress appropriately, but not don't just stress to get THC stress, to get all of the expressions
[02:16:59.550 --> 02:17:04.830]  that you're looking for. So anyway, that's, that's some side shit I'm doing. And, and when you,
[02:17:04.830 --> 02:17:08.510]  when you said that, it was like, well, she's, she's on this fucking horse too.
[02:17:10.430 --> 02:17:16.590]  Yeah. I think another way that, you know, when you're cracking seeds too, you, you really got
[02:17:16.590 --> 02:17:24.670]  a kind of do some different environmental stress triggers to really get them to express the, the
[02:17:25.630 --> 02:17:32.670]  big and little details that are different among the different genotypes. And one of the things
[02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:40.430]  that, that I like to do is like a 1311 light cycle, right? Like have a shorter or taper down
[02:17:41.470 --> 02:17:48.270]  to where I'm finishing in longer light hours, or I'm sorry, longer dark hours. And then, you know,
[02:17:48.270 --> 02:17:56.670]  like interesting about water though, right? Like I really like to, to know that it's cool to know
[02:17:56.670 --> 02:18:02.990]  after all the testing that's going on with the, the day and age that we're in, you know, and you
[02:18:02.990 --> 02:18:08.270]  would think two light cycles as well, like finishing in blues or finishing running blues the
[02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:14.510]  whole time, or so, or the different UV that's available to, to the plant that you're giving.
[02:18:14.510 --> 02:18:21.950]  Cause yo, like I keep chameleons and I'm literally buying like T5 bulbs that are UV bulbs. So,
[02:18:21.950 --> 02:18:29.150]  so I can get like 6 and 12% UVB bulbs to just throw up in a little T5 over a canopy and,
[02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:36.430]  and UV produces more resin, right? So it's yeah, there's, I think there's a lot of different,
[02:18:36.430 --> 02:18:43.630]  I think it would be really cool to like compose a list of the different ways that people are using
[02:18:43.710 --> 02:18:49.790]  to, to really, like you said, push the phenotypic expressions among, among strains. Cause you really
[02:18:49.790 --> 02:18:55.950]  got to push them to know what they end up doing. You know, you can't just run it once or twice and
[02:18:57.150 --> 02:19:02.190]  call it a day. You have to work with it a long time to really see, you know,
[02:19:02.190 --> 02:19:06.590]  and pay close attention to what different things you're doing to, to get it to do,
[02:19:06.590 --> 02:19:12.990]  do the different things. Well, you know, if you're interested, I have so many tools right now in my
[02:19:12.990 --> 02:19:22.190]  toolbox from the, the watering system should be available in March or April. It was alpha tested.
[02:19:22.190 --> 02:19:30.430]  Now it's begun beta testing. I'm working with a group that has released a four part endo,
[02:19:30.430 --> 02:19:38.990]  endophytic bacteria cocktail. So what that does is that pushes lateral root growth. So every root,
[02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:44.670]  you have a root drop and then it pushes lateral, every infection site pushes laterals and then
[02:19:44.670 --> 02:19:50.830]  laterals again, then laterals again on laterals again. So this particular, yeah, this particular
[02:19:50.830 --> 02:19:58.270]  bacteria shows amazing potential. Well, I just installed it in 1500 strawberries here in Oxnard,
[02:19:58.270 --> 02:20:03.790]  but I still have a vial of about a thousand left. So if you want to play in the sandbox, let me know.
[02:20:03.870 --> 02:20:09.150]  And I'd be more than happy to, you know, come down, install them. So you know how to do it and
[02:20:09.150 --> 02:20:15.390]  you can install the rest. I can bring my microscope down, take a look at what your biological levels
[02:20:15.390 --> 02:20:20.750]  are and then suggest whether it's an AMO, which is an aquatic microorganism, because I think you
[02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:26.350]  are hydro. So that would probably be where I'd steer you. These are, so these are aquatic
[02:20:26.350 --> 02:20:31.470]  microorganisms. There's nobody on the market that has these right now. So they're basically,
[02:20:31.470 --> 02:20:36.670]  they're in vivo. So that means they're grown in nature. So they're, you know what mammoth pee is,
[02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:42.190]  right? Yes. Mammoth pee. Yeah. Okay. So they're grown in vitro. They're grown in a lab.
[02:20:43.150 --> 02:20:48.670]  So these are grown in nature and they're phosphate, folic, solubilizing bacteria, nitrogen fixers,
[02:20:49.470 --> 02:20:56.270]  aquatic yeast, diatoms. I mean, it's all this amazing stuff specifically for, you know,
[02:20:56.350 --> 02:21:01.390]  aqueous environments. It can work, it does work well in soil as well, but I tend to think that
[02:21:01.390 --> 02:21:10.190]  it would be a better fit for, for your flood. Do you feel, so something I've always kind of
[02:21:10.190 --> 02:21:17.150]  been curious about with adding living, like microbials to like irrigation systems, like,
[02:21:17.150 --> 02:21:22.510]  do you think like pushing things through the pumps, am I like decimating populations? Like
[02:21:22.510 --> 02:21:26.830]  when I brew teas and stuff, you know what I'm saying? Like something about.
[02:21:28.350 --> 02:21:36.030]  Any pump that's centrifugal is going to cause what's called cavitation. So cavitation is when
[02:21:36.030 --> 02:21:43.710]  you create these pockets of high pressure and low pressure, high oxygen, low oxygen. And yeah,
[02:21:43.710 --> 02:21:49.150]  decimates the microbial communities, but it's still, you're still, you're not going to destroy
[02:21:49.470 --> 02:21:55.230]  the bacteria. You're going to destroy the, you know, aquatic yeasts, the nematodes, the bigger,
[02:21:55.230 --> 02:22:02.590]  more advanced organisms like flagellates. So it's not going to kill everything, but it is going to
[02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:09.390]  knock back your, your communities. But in your situation where you are, all you got to do is put
[02:22:09.390 --> 02:22:15.310]  your microbials into a mix and pour it onto your medium and not in your reservoir. And then you
[02:22:15.310 --> 02:22:18.990]  throw the AMOs in your reservoir and then now you've got the best of both worlds.
[02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:26.030]  Yeah. It was just a quick question. Cause I mean, like, like with nematodes, right. They're kind of
[02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:31.630]  like too large that they get thrashed about if you're delivering through an irrigation system
[02:22:31.630 --> 02:22:37.630]  with a pump. Yeah. Absolutely. Think of them as like water balloons. You know, you touch them with
[02:22:37.630 --> 02:22:46.190]  a pin, they just go. They're so cute though. Oh, they are. They are. They're good. They're
[02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:52.030]  great little workers, man. When you have them in play. We typically say, if you see a nematode
[02:22:52.670 --> 02:22:56.990]  in a microscope slide, then you're pretty much done. You know, you're, you know, you're in a
[02:22:56.990 --> 02:23:04.030]  great place because the nematode really represents the T-Rex. So the alpha, alpha of all the animals.
[02:23:04.030 --> 02:23:09.230]  So the only reason he's going to be there is that if you have all of the other successionary
[02:23:09.230 --> 02:23:15.550]  animals and species that allows that super predator to be present. So yeah, nematodes are the bomb.
[02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:22.350]  They're the apex predator of the microbial world. Yes, they are.
[02:23:23.070 --> 02:23:38.910]  I also learned, like if you add nematodes, say, if you add them to
[02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:49.070]  your reservoir and you're stirring, mixing, mixing, right? The weight of these
[02:23:49.790 --> 02:23:56.510]  said nematodes always go to the bottom. They're heavier. So it's like, you kind of got to be
[02:23:56.510 --> 02:24:04.590]  conscientious when you're delivering them because if you say, my dog is yelling at me. If you say,
[02:24:07.310 --> 02:24:12.990]  water with like, you know, a two horsepower nutrient pump with a hose or whatever,
[02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:19.630]  it's that sucks water up from the bottom. The first like 10 pots that you water are going to
[02:24:19.630 --> 02:24:24.670]  get the most concentrated, even if you're mixing. Or even if you have like the funnel bottom,
[02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:32.590]  you know, vortex style reservoirs, they always sink to the bottom. So when you're doing it,
[02:24:32.590 --> 02:24:37.870]  make sure like the second time you deliver to do it on a different set of plants first,
[02:24:37.870 --> 02:24:41.630]  because everybody has the habit of watering the first set of plants every time, like start from
[02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:47.790]  the upper left corner, you know? So just because the nature of it is some fun fact I recently
[02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:52.830]  learned for like nematode distribution. I'll be right back though, because she's very like,
[02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:53.950]  I need water. So.
[02:24:56.350 --> 02:25:01.390]  No, she's spot on about that. Nematode distribution. I usually suggest people
[02:25:02.510 --> 02:25:07.950]  put them in a cone bottom brewer. It could be a 15 gallon brewer. It doesn't have to be anything
[02:25:07.950 --> 02:25:13.870]  huge, but that cone bottom will evenly suspend them in the water column and continually suspend
[02:25:13.870 --> 02:25:19.390]  them there. And then when I say it's just take a cup, like just bring a cup, scoop it right off
[02:25:19.390 --> 02:25:23.470]  the top because you know, everything's being stirred up and then apply it. And that way you
[02:25:23.470 --> 02:25:28.350]  will equally distribute them. The other way, it's like she said, you know, if you water from left
[02:25:28.350 --> 02:25:35.150]  to right the first time, then water right to left the second time and then repeat front to back
[02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:38.350]  because otherwise you're never going to get them equally distributed.
[02:25:39.070 --> 02:25:44.510]  Because she's right. They sink. Definitely. Were there any questions on any of that stuff?
[02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:51.230]  Yeah. So I was going to say while she's gone, let's throw a latent question. So Sun On Demand,
[02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:59.550]  which if anybody has ever gone to like a trade show and seen a cat and his name's
[02:26:00.190 --> 02:26:07.470]  Sun, short for a much longer name, but do you have any experience with the Sun On Demand lights?
[02:26:08.670 --> 02:26:12.190]  Those are the high UV ones. Those are the high UV.
[02:26:14.350 --> 02:26:19.470]  I'm trying to even think of how to describe them. Maybe someone in the chat can. Anyway,
[02:26:19.470 --> 02:26:23.070]  if you're not familiar with them, we can probably move on because we got a bunch of other questions.
[02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:30.190]  But well, you know, there is something I want to touch on because Miss Radner brought it up and
[02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:34.990]  it was about, you know, and I wanted to ask her, have you ever played with napping your plants?
[02:26:35.550 --> 02:26:43.070]  So giving your plant a mid afternoon nap. Oh, so reduce lights. Oh, it's another trick that I've
[02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:48.110]  been hearing a lot about. It's like giving your plants a chance to just take a break.
[02:26:48.110 --> 02:26:53.790]  And once you let them have that little 20 minute nap, then you bring the lights back up to full
[02:26:53.790 --> 02:26:59.230]  speed and you'll see plant reaction again. So instead of just getting slowly tighter and tighter,
[02:26:59.230 --> 02:27:04.510]  you give them that little rest and then the vigor snaps back after that, that rest when you bring
[02:27:04.510 --> 02:27:11.310]  the lights fully up again. Another form of stressing that is steering. So there's a lot
[02:27:11.310 --> 02:27:17.390]  of these that we could go down a lot of rounds. But yeah, go ahead, Peter. Now that you describe
[02:27:17.390 --> 02:27:23.390]  it, I mean, you know, you think about like, say you're running greenhouse and you're in the
[02:27:23.390 --> 02:27:29.230]  middle of summer, like something some of the big producers do is like put that 20 percent shade
[02:27:29.230 --> 02:27:39.390]  cloth over like midday because the light is just too intense, too much. Right. As far as like how
[02:27:41.230 --> 02:27:46.990]  much we drop in the lights back percentage wise to induce that nap? Because I mean, plants have a
[02:27:48.270 --> 02:27:53.790]  they have like a limited or they, you know, they reach a limit where they don't
[02:27:53.790 --> 02:27:59.070]  take any more light in that. They just look like they're going to sleep. The name of it is.
[02:28:00.510 --> 02:28:06.190]  Yeah, I think that the the studies and the people that I've been communicating with that
[02:28:06.190 --> 02:28:12.030]  are have played with this basically found that the sweet spot was around 80 percent light reduction.
[02:28:12.350 --> 02:28:14.110]  Like midday?
[02:28:14.110 --> 02:28:22.350]  Yeah, well, not like like figure, you know, you're 12 and 12 and in that. Right. So, you know, like
[02:28:22.350 --> 02:28:29.550]  maybe seven hours in six, seven, eight hours in, you give them a 20 minute nap and then you snap
[02:28:29.550 --> 02:28:37.790]  the lights all the way back up to to 100 percent. Interesting. And they've seen it's interesting
[02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:44.270]  plant reaction to the point where they haven't done a complete side by side again. It's like
[02:28:44.270 --> 02:28:50.110]  finding the right place where you have the same genetics in the same controlled environments,
[02:28:50.910 --> 02:28:53.950]  you know, side by side where you can start really testing.
[02:28:53.950 --> 02:28:58.270]  The shit has been a real challenge. Like I know people that have these girls that are playing
[02:28:58.270 --> 02:29:04.350]  with this, but you can't test side by side unless you have two rooms that you're doing exactly that
[02:29:04.430 --> 02:29:08.910]  are exactly the same control that one you can do one thing and the other you can do it different.
[02:29:09.790 --> 02:29:17.310]  Yeah, like your future troll master has the ability to light, you know, a lot of control.
[02:29:17.310 --> 02:29:25.070]  So it's like I have two rows in my indoor, I in my rooms, I can have one light line be like 75
[02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:29.710]  percent and the other one be like 115. And then essentially you would kind of only want to test
[02:29:29.710 --> 02:29:36.030]  the outer side ones because of the light overlapping. Right. But that would be a way
[02:29:36.030 --> 02:29:43.310]  to compare it. Like I think I can. Would that be something you do the entire flower cycle or maybe
[02:29:43.310 --> 02:29:50.110]  just like high flower production week four, five and six, six, seven, eight? Well, you know, that's
[02:29:50.110 --> 02:29:55.950]  the million dollar question because they they focused on this resting just in vegetation.
[02:29:56.750 --> 02:30:02.750]  So I don't know what would happen if you did it the whole cycle through. But my gut feeling is that
[02:30:02.750 --> 02:30:09.150]  if you're you're probably in the same situation of flower as you are veg, you're going to get to
[02:30:09.150 --> 02:30:13.630]  the point where the plant's tired and it's basically going to say, I don't want any food.
[02:30:13.630 --> 02:30:18.190]  I don't want any water. I don't want any light. Just leave me the **** alone. You know, and that's
[02:30:18.190 --> 02:30:23.950]  again, as cannabis cultivators, we're always trying to push the envelope to get either the
[02:30:23.950 --> 02:30:30.510]  yield or the secondary metabolites that we're looking for. So I you know, my my instinct says
[02:30:30.510 --> 02:30:38.430]  that I would do it from start to end compared to a plant that was run traditionally the normal way
[02:30:38.990 --> 02:30:43.310]  and then see what the results are. I mean, measure the cannabinoids, measure the turpenoids and see
[02:30:43.310 --> 02:30:52.190]  the terpenes to to see where you are. And if if in fact you once again found that sweet spot to
[02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:58.430]  really get that plant to express its fullest potential by, you know, giving it giving it a
[02:30:58.430 --> 02:31:03.630]  couple of these little gentle stresses, but nothing crazy and giving them a chance to take a nap in
[02:31:03.630 --> 02:31:08.030]  the afternoon. I mean, come on. How cool would that be? Right. Hey, Bob, I got to go take my
[02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:14.830]  half an hour nap, right? Yeah, they I mean, they definitely like tell you when they're tired,
[02:31:14.830 --> 02:31:21.950]  you know, so it makes sense, like with the daily light and integral. So it's like I almost feel
[02:31:21.950 --> 02:31:34.750]  like it. So maybe it's like maybe it's like if your room is getting super like warm and dry by
[02:31:34.750 --> 02:31:43.710]  those hours where. That would induce stress with lights being on full power
[02:31:44.350 --> 02:31:53.630]  to kind of give it a break, you know, though I think if we're speaking specifically kind of
[02:31:54.270 --> 02:31:59.230]  I mean, it depends on if what you're farming for to like if you're farming for the different
[02:31:59.230 --> 02:32:06.350]  cannabinoid and products because you're doing concentrate with it versus,
[02:32:06.910 --> 02:32:15.870]  uh, you know, just trying to grow really good weed. I think I think I would maybe taper lights
[02:32:15.870 --> 02:32:22.190]  down towards the end of the light cycle versus like midday, maybe. But it you know, it's it'd
[02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:30.230]  be interesting to watch what happens, right? In my mind, it's always about experimenting. I mean,
[02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:35.110]  how else do you learn? So, you know, I'm one of those geeks that is like I'm never satisfied.
[02:32:35.110 --> 02:32:39.590]  There's always another experiment to do. You know, it's just each one is a lesson.
[02:32:39.590 --> 02:32:43.110]  And there's no such thing as failures. They're just lessons. They just told you
[02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:49.910]  this was a good idea or that was a bad idea. Right. But how else do you learn without trying?
[02:32:51.270 --> 02:32:54.550]  There are some people on the chat who think it's a very bad idea,
[02:32:54.550 --> 02:32:59.030]  but especially with a really weak or unknown genetic, I would think.
[02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:04.390]  Say that again. With like really unknown genetics or weak genetics, I don't know,
[02:33:04.390 --> 02:33:09.910]  but you have to really know your room and really know your you know what you're playing with.
[02:33:12.710 --> 02:33:15.990]  To implement that, I would I would feel like on a commercial scale.
[02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:20.310]  Oh, well, yeah, this this is an experiment. This is experimental.
[02:33:20.310 --> 02:33:24.790]  Yeah, it's really just to see just to prove the concept of how well.
[02:33:25.590 --> 02:33:31.830]  Yeah, he is not. He is not saying. Yeah, no. And I mean, all you're doing is like
[02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:37.510]  letting up the light intensity. So it's not like the plant isn't still processing and doing its
[02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:42.310]  things with the light that's available. You're just giving it a break. Like you would also
[02:33:42.310 --> 02:33:48.950]  do something like lower the CO2 or something, because with less light intensity also comes
[02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:53.910]  like with a little bit of a drop in temperature, which is, you know, all these things affect
[02:33:53.910 --> 02:33:59.190]  plant processes. So it's totally worth like if you're familiar with the strain, you know, yeah.
[02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:06.310]  See what it's like, you're right. Think of it as you're out on the beach,
[02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:12.310]  you know, in that blazing hot sun and a nice cloud comes over, you go, ah, right.
[02:34:12.310 --> 02:34:18.390]  You kind of relax a little because, yeah, it makes so, you know, again, the work that I've
[02:34:18.390 --> 02:34:23.910]  seen so far indicates that it has some real potential. And again, it's not like you're shutting it down.
[02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:29.430]  And again, yeah, well, just to clarify in the chat, you're not saying turn the lights off for
[02:34:29.430 --> 02:34:35.030]  X period of time. You're saying just reduce the intensity, like as if a cloud came over your head
[02:34:35.030 --> 02:34:40.870]  for a certain period of time. Like I'm dropping a thousand or eleven hundred watt light intensity to like
[02:34:40.950 --> 02:34:47.030]  700 watts just so that way it can like, you know, I agree.
[02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:50.070]  Puts it in a meditation.
[02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:57.190]  Yeah. I mean, it's all energy, right? We're trying to get to it's a marathon, so we're not trying to
[02:34:57.190 --> 02:35:00.870]  hammer it home the whole way. You see my colors.
[02:35:00.870 --> 02:35:11.750]  Yeah. And then there's this other gear that's pretty cool where it supplements like the morning light.
[02:35:12.710 --> 02:35:19.590]  So when the lights first come on, they're low, they're more red, and then they slowly warm up
[02:35:19.590 --> 02:35:26.390]  over an hour or two into the yellows and then the high UV. And then later in the day, it starts to
[02:35:26.390 --> 02:35:34.150]  cycle down more toward the reds. And again, it's slowly letting them down. So it's like
[02:35:34.150 --> 02:35:39.670]  mimicking the sun coming up, getting overhead and then dropping back down. And again, with all of
[02:35:39.670 --> 02:35:47.190]  this computer controllers, all this stuff is possible. But someone has to be creative and
[02:35:47.190 --> 02:35:54.150]  have a space again that they're willing to sacrifice, perhaps production for a little
[02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:59.270]  understanding on what the potential of this type of tech can actually provide.
[02:35:59.910 --> 02:36:05.110]  You know, that's where it's like I said, it's hard to find someone to commit, you know, a whole room
[02:36:05.670 --> 02:36:09.590]  to an experiment because you're like, yeah, you know, that's a lot of money. That's, you know,
[02:36:09.590 --> 02:36:15.350]  that's my bread and butter. This is where and again, you know, you say, oh, well, let's do it
[02:36:15.350 --> 02:36:22.150]  in tents. Well, tents are just too small scale. That's like, you know, that's the DIY thing. And
[02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:28.310]  you're really not going to get a true answer that way. But you could like there's a lot of
[02:36:28.310 --> 02:36:33.430]  cool shit out there that's available. Yeah, you could pull a tarp over a greenhouse halfway midday
[02:36:33.430 --> 02:36:40.070]  to give it some shade or the shade closet. They make a 10%, 5%, 20% shade cloth just to I mean,
[02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:46.950]  yo, you have to really be in a really warm, really humid, really fucking to understand how like just
[02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:55.830]  it's so heavy, right? A tent doesn't really give you the same feel as a 500 plant greenhouse or,
[02:36:55.830 --> 02:37:02.710]  you know. So yeah, you pull up midday, definitely. I think as far as like tests, I like to
[02:37:04.310 --> 02:37:11.590]  keep my blue lights in until like, you know, week two, week three of flower and then slowly
[02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:17.590]  transition into red because in nature, in the spring, when all the growth happens, it's all
[02:37:17.590 --> 02:37:22.310]  high blues, right? And then we transition into reds in the falls. And that's kind of when
[02:37:23.270 --> 02:37:32.390]  the plant naturally ripens. So I try to mimic that. It's another fun thing to control environment
[02:37:32.390 --> 02:37:38.630]  wise to and then like the 1113 lighting, you know, you're changing the spectrum and giving it
[02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:43.590]  a little bit. But it also depends on what you're processing for too or, you know, producing for
[02:37:43.590 --> 02:37:52.390]  because if you're growing for live resin, like live resin doesn't give plants really a chance to,
[02:37:53.270 --> 02:37:57.270]  everybody pulls that shit way too early, right? So that you don't even get a chance to really
[02:37:57.270 --> 02:38:02.950]  develop all the different cannabinoids and phytochemicals because you're
[02:38:03.750 --> 02:38:10.230]  cutting it at like week seven before it really develops and ripens. It's like a fruit. It's a
[02:38:10.230 --> 02:38:18.950]  fruit. Like you would never bite into a fucking peach or a plum early or an avocado early, right?
[02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:26.870]  There's a sweet spot. So you gotta be patient. So live resin has done some numbers to what people
[02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:35.270]  think good oil is, right? It's fire for if you preserve the terpenes, but you don't have to cut
[02:38:35.270 --> 02:38:40.550]  early for terpene preservation, you know, just handle it properly, right? You guys do a lot of
[02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:49.350]  live resin. Yeah. In Colorado. Smoking on right now, live resin. Just kidding. Rasen I bet,
[02:38:49.350 --> 02:38:55.430]  hopefully. Live resin, Labradorji. What flavors, what cannabinoids right now?
[02:38:58.540 --> 02:39:04.300]  We just have some Legenoji. Ooh, is it gassy gassy or is it like sweet gassy?
[02:39:05.180 --> 02:39:13.580]  It's like sweet gassy. It's like cushy gassy. It shimmers. It better.
[02:39:14.300 --> 02:39:23.500]  Yes. Yeah. You can see the color too. Nice. Hey, where's the hand model? We could get that up to
[02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:32.380]  the screen. He's our hand model. He multitasks. Yeah, for sure.
[02:39:33.980 --> 02:39:39.580]  When he's not a standing coma on camera, he's the hand model off camera.
[02:39:40.540 --> 02:39:51.900]  Albedo. Moonlights. Moonlight. So do you guys want to, because I got a P and go to the post
[02:39:51.900 --> 02:40:00.700]  office. So you guys want to wrap it up here? And I reached out to a couple of musicians. Let me,
[02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:05.740]  yeah, none of them. If one of them was like, I can go live right now. I'd be like, and we have
[02:40:06.540 --> 02:40:15.420]  our musical guest. That'd have been so BA. Badass. But yeah, no, I have some, some heavy
[02:40:16.540 --> 02:40:26.620]  dub in the pipeline, which is my jam from old school Jamaican to more modern stuff. But
[02:40:27.580 --> 02:40:35.660]  just so just quickly, a couple of things. One, for the people in the chat who keep asking about
[02:40:35.660 --> 02:40:45.420]  the James loud stuff, I've been diligently packing up seeds. I'm still waiting on some more.
[02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:51.420]  Those will go out shortly, but I'm super organized. I got all sorts of
[02:40:51.900 --> 02:41:01.180]  packaging going on. And this is like, I got to put stickers on all the Mylar. So there's the
[02:41:01.180 --> 02:41:11.340]  ganja farmer. And I'm waiting on the canogenic stuff. But and then so one of the things that
[02:41:11.340 --> 02:41:15.740]  bummed me out and late, I'm going to mute your mic because I can hear the there's a glitchiness, but
[02:41:16.060 --> 02:41:27.340]  I just got you. So after Sunday, where there was much drama on a specific on the third show of the
[02:41:27.340 --> 02:41:35.820]  day. Some people question or Yeah, actually, a couple people reached out to me and we're like,
[02:41:35.820 --> 02:41:43.420]  is that what you're all about? Like, and I'm just like, no, look at my entire body of work.
[02:41:44.140 --> 02:41:52.460]  And generally 99.999% of the conversations are like this one, where it's just people talking
[02:41:52.460 --> 02:41:58.460]  shop. And I think that's what everyone appreciates is just like, I can hang out in the chat with old
[02:41:58.460 --> 02:42:05.500]  friends, I can listen to interesting conversation, I may not always agree with it. But just like when
[02:42:05.500 --> 02:42:11.420]  we're all together, you wouldn't tell someone they're a fucking idiot to their face, like you
[02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:22.700]  would anonymously. Goodness. But anyway, so one, anybody, if they want to know whether I aspire to
[02:42:22.700 --> 02:42:29.740]  be the Jerry Springer of cannabis, I do not. I aspire to have intelligent I like for me, I'm just
[02:42:29.740 --> 02:42:35.980]  like, I like conversations where I'm learning stuff. And I find like, it's like, if I find it
[02:42:35.980 --> 02:42:44.220]  interesting, probably some other people will too. And I don't care if if you know, like you, you,
[02:42:44.860 --> 02:42:51.260]  Miss Rad Reefer have a big Instagram fan base, but like, I could care less if you had two followers,
[02:42:51.260 --> 02:42:56.940]  I'd still want you to come on and we do like we have, you know, all the time I'm trying to bring
[02:42:56.940 --> 02:43:03.020]  on people who are unknown who I'm like, this person's really intelligent. I think they deserve,
[02:43:03.820 --> 02:43:10.140]  you know, to, they deserve a spotlight and other people should hear what they have to say. And,
[02:43:11.260 --> 02:43:17.660]  you know, you never know how a conversation is going to turn out. But Sunday, the show got trolled.
[02:43:20.060 --> 02:43:27.980]  A someone told all their fans to come in the chat and troll the show because the guest was someone
[02:43:27.980 --> 02:43:34.300]  they had a beef with, which me, as you know, I kind of felt like, you know, the blood's in the
[02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:39.980]  crypts. And I was big worm who just wanted to give the kids their ice cream. And I'm like,
[02:43:40.540 --> 02:43:44.540]  just anybody want ice cream? It's a sunny hot day out. And I'm like, in the middle, you know,
[02:43:44.540 --> 02:43:52.700]  suddenly, there's the crossfire. And I hope people will forgive me and not, you know, I'll hold
[02:43:52.700 --> 02:43:58.380]  myself accountable for that. But now I think we're back on track with the type of programming I
[02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:07.340]  enjoy. And I hope people Yeah, I don't know. I just it's been a tough like Sunday was a fun day
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:13.020]  until it wasn't a fun day. And all I wanted to do at the end was just watch the Patriots game and
[02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:23.420]  chill out on my couch. And I've been hearing it since then. And it sucked. And in the meantime,
[02:44:23.420 --> 02:44:29.260]  like, while I have that going on, I'm trying to pack up, you know, hundreds and hundreds,
[02:44:30.060 --> 02:44:36.940]  hundreds of packs of beans, which my I need like my six year old's tiny fingers to.
[02:44:37.740 --> 02:44:44.220]  So anyway, that's that's my I save this till the end. But that's my little
[02:44:46.220 --> 02:44:51.180]  I don't know. It's not a soapbox. It's not I don't know what it is. It's just
[02:44:51.740 --> 02:44:57.020]  shit that's been hanging over my head. And anyway, there's
[02:44:57.020 --> 02:45:00.460]  sometimes it's out of your control, though. And you sir are a gentleman and a scholar.
[02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:09.420]  Thank you. So with that, I'm just trying to think so today's Thursday. I know.
[02:45:11.660 --> 02:45:17.100]  Good God, my mind's mush right now. But I know Sunday we have we have the James Loud show
[02:45:17.100 --> 02:45:23.740]  next Thursday. We're back with who were we back with? Wendy Kornberg. Wendy, right. And actually,
[02:45:23.740 --> 02:45:29.020]  that'll be interesting. Because Greg McAllister, if you're still listening, I did get my brown rice
[02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:35.820]  vinegar and I was going to make my WCA with all the eggshells I've been saving. So maybe we can
[02:45:35.820 --> 02:45:43.340]  do it live with Wendy. Yeah, lots to learn on that episode as well. But then Scott said he
[02:45:43.340 --> 02:45:47.820]  doesn't like eggshells because you never know if they have calcium in them. So I'm just like.
[02:45:51.660 --> 02:45:57.100]  But anyway, I'm going to try to make it and that would be a good one to do it on. So I guess with
[02:45:57.100 --> 02:46:05.580]  that, thank you so much for jumping on with us. We hope you come back. And I think everybody loved
[02:46:07.180 --> 02:46:13.340]  your insights, your calm demeanor, your. Can we take a picture?
[02:46:15.500 --> 02:46:24.620]  Sure. All right. So I'll count. I'll count. Here we go. Ready, guys? One, two, and three.
[02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:27.580]  Yay. Awesome.
[02:46:29.900 --> 02:46:34.860]  Michelle, we really appreciate this. This is a ton of your time and we know your time is valuable.
[02:46:34.860 --> 02:46:39.260]  So thank you so much for that. I had so much fun and I'm super honored. And shout out to
[02:46:39.260 --> 02:46:46.060]  Dank Dutchess Sheila, right? From Miss Fabulous for putting me in connect with you. So yeah,
[02:46:46.060 --> 02:46:51.500]  this is great. I'm super humbled. I learned a lot. So it's always good, right?
[02:46:52.460 --> 02:46:55.260]  Mm-hmm. Thank you so much for coming on. Really appreciate it.
[02:46:56.140 --> 02:46:59.340]  Sending good vibes on the years, guys, on the rest of the year. Good holiday.
[02:47:01.260 --> 02:47:02.380]  Happy holidays, everybody.
[02:47:04.060 --> 02:47:11.020]  See you, everyone. Oh, and also just randomly, I posted it earlier, but if people can follow
[02:47:11.100 --> 02:47:15.500]  FCP2, which is currently called a super long...
[02:47:19.260 --> 02:47:24.220]  The whole point of getting to 100 followers is so I can change the name to FCP2,
[02:47:24.220 --> 02:47:31.740]  so it's not some gobbledygook long string of numbers and characters. And then we'll go live
[02:47:31.740 --> 02:47:39.980]  with FCP2. And I've been quietly waiting to do that so we can have more programming. And actually,
[02:47:39.980 --> 02:47:47.740]  this gets back to what I was saying before. The stuff I've always... I like to learn and I think
[02:47:47.740 --> 02:47:54.380]  everybody else does. And I think we've created a... It's like we're all in lockdown, wherever you
[02:47:54.380 --> 02:48:00.460]  stand on whether we should be or not. Most of us are at home for extended periods of time. And I
[02:48:00.460 --> 02:48:06.780]  think creating an environment where people can come together and catch up with old friends in
[02:48:06.780 --> 02:48:13.820]  the chat and roll a joint and listen to good conversation and challenge their brains and be
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:19.740]  entertained. And, you know, that's... Wow. Yeah. I think it's like totally the way that
[02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:28.860]  the attention and focus of people are right now is like these get togethers and these like
[02:48:28.860 --> 02:48:35.100]  meeting of the minds. And, you know, because we don't have events anymore, not only because of
[02:48:35.100 --> 02:48:42.300]  the coronavirus and the pandemic, but also because we all look forward to getting together
[02:48:43.020 --> 02:48:48.700]  and seeing all the events. But now it's like, so this is really cool to have been a part of because
[02:48:48.700 --> 02:48:56.220]  I think, you know, our learning powwow will be there forever on the YouTube, on the channels. And,
[02:48:57.020 --> 02:49:02.700]  you know, it'll be cool to reflect on too. Right. So thank you so much for this. This is way rad.
[02:49:03.580 --> 02:49:08.460]  And from Hawaii, you get two thumbs up from Greg.
[02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:12.220]  Yay! Appreciate that, Greg. Fuck yeah.
[02:49:12.940 --> 02:49:18.620]  All right. And with that, I will kill the live stream so I can immediately run to the bathroom
[02:49:18.620 --> 02:49:21.100]  and then to the post office. Bye, guys.
[02:49:21.100 --> 02:49:23.420]  Thank you, everyone. See you guys.
[02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:25.820]  Thanks, everybody. Peace out.
