[00:11.520 --> 00:18.000]  This is my partner Eric and Eric was someone that I had on an interview for
[00:18.000 --> 00:23.100]  the first Breeder Series because I respect him as an individual and I
[00:23.100 --> 00:28.920]  respect his work. But what Eric did was Eric transferred over to Topicals
[00:28.920 --> 00:34.680]  because his ability to get a license was hampered because nursery licenses to
[00:34.680 --> 00:38.680]  function as a breeder require a nursery license to sell and that means you have
[00:38.680 --> 00:42.820]  to have commercial real estate and so commercial real estate is expensive and
[00:42.820 --> 00:47.380]  so for the majority of people that I know they don't have the ability to
[00:47.380 --> 00:52.180]  really have all the tools and so Eric shifts over to Topicals but lo and
[00:52.180 --> 00:57.880]  behold one of his flagship creations wins the Emerald Cup and I said oh my
[00:57.880 --> 01:04.020]  gosh I said you're still a breeder in who you are and you're still alive in
[01:04.020 --> 01:07.600]  cannabis because you just made an adjustment to where you were going to go
[01:07.600 --> 01:11.880]  forward with what you did but I said but I would love to have you come up and
[01:11.880 --> 01:18.200]  you know be introduced because you're somebody who created a variety that won
[01:18.200 --> 01:23.440]  a major competition and allowed the people who grew it to have sellability
[01:23.440 --> 01:28.200]  because these these wins give you publicity and then it creates a demand
[01:28.200 --> 01:33.240]  and I just said man even though you're not breeding in the normal sense anymore
[01:33.360 --> 01:39.480]  your creations are resonating and he also had done work prior that he didn't
[01:39.480 --> 01:44.240]  get credit for that I had done huge movements of the material and he gets a
[01:44.240 --> 01:48.680]  hold of me one day and he said hey on the galaxy my material in your material
[01:48.680 --> 01:51.680]  are the same material and I don't understand how that can be and I said
[01:51.680 --> 01:56.200]  oh it's easy somebody fucked you and I got a hold of it and you never got
[01:56.200 --> 01:59.640]  credit so what we're gonna do is we're gonna give you credit for the material
[01:59.680 --> 02:08.970]  you did because otherwise what happens is you get diminished so so so
[02:08.970 --> 02:13.010]  definitely not a one-hit wonder someone who's been in business a long time who's
[02:13.010 --> 02:17.210]  done a lot of good breeding work who's developed a lot of varieties the we
[02:17.210 --> 02:20.090]  called the green ribbon but it was the hottest variety in the Sacramento
[02:20.090 --> 02:24.690]  cannabis market so before they wiped out the Sacramento cannabis market it was
[02:24.690 --> 02:29.450]  booming the variety that he created was one of the hottest varieties one of the
[02:29.450 --> 02:34.250]  hardest clones to get your hands on because it was hoarded and when I
[02:34.250 --> 02:38.530]  realized that he had done this I said my gosh I said you need to be able to bring
[02:38.530 --> 02:42.370]  this out and so my whole thing with a lot of the interviews is I just give you
[02:42.370 --> 02:46.370]  a chance to talk and then I'll ask some questions and then we open it up to the
[02:46.370 --> 02:50.290]  audience quick because you're gonna want to ask people these questions of like
[02:50.290 --> 02:54.650]  what direction are you moving what what motivated you to do this what was the
[02:54.650 --> 02:59.050]  source material you used where do you see the industry moving because these
[02:59.050 --> 03:02.250]  are the information that you need because you're not gonna get this from
[03:02.250 --> 03:07.610]  anybody nobody in the mainstream everybody makes you sign NDs even talk
[03:07.610 --> 03:12.070]  to him now and so the thing is all the information that's being generated is
[03:12.070 --> 03:15.730]  being preserved and held for a very specific group of people just like
[03:15.730 --> 03:21.410]  economics economics was a study paid for and funded by the wealthy to understand
[03:21.410 --> 03:25.630]  how do they remain wealthy and why do you not get economics education in
[03:25.630 --> 03:29.470]  school because they don't want you to be wealthy and so to me this is the same
[03:29.470 --> 03:33.230]  information as you get an opportunity to talk to some sharp people and I'm gonna
[03:33.230 --> 03:36.630]  get off the mic and give it there
[03:40.190 --> 03:46.310]  everybody hear me hello my name is Eric minor I own HBK I'm second generation
[03:46.310 --> 03:54.990]  farmer yeah so yeah I'm second generation my father grew when I was
[03:54.990 --> 03:59.750]  really little and then I kind of picked it up in high school I'm so Cal so I
[03:59.750 --> 04:03.150]  don't really have a lot of ties to Humboldt area except for the last few
[04:03.150 --> 04:08.470]  years as I've been progressing to get up into this area I had a lot of success
[04:08.470 --> 04:13.990]  with my topicals I started making topicals in the mid 90s my daughter was
[04:13.990 --> 04:18.310]  born with a rare skin condition so I was one of the few that were actually making
[04:18.310 --> 04:24.030]  topicals for people before there was excess material to just say hey what the
[04:24.030 --> 04:27.270]  hell are we gonna do with all this material let's dump it into a topical
[04:27.270 --> 04:32.830]  brand and try to move it so there were a need for what I was doing at that time
[04:32.830 --> 04:37.630]  and when I first started breeding in the early 90s there were no seed banks
[04:37.630 --> 04:43.590]  available to just go you know order seeds if you needed seeds you had to
[04:43.590 --> 04:47.990]  source it from somebody else and then create your own seeds you just didn't go
[04:47.990 --> 04:53.510]  buy big lots of seeds to then you know I want this strain I'm gonna go source it
[04:53.510 --> 04:59.550]  out so for me breeding was a necessity in the beginning and that kind of just
[04:59.550 --> 05:05.030]  led into me getting the strains out there but realistically like the reason
[05:05.030 --> 05:10.150]  I got kind of screwed on some of my strains was being an older breeder we
[05:10.150 --> 05:13.990]  didn't tell people what we were doing we stayed very quiet we only dealt with
[05:13.990 --> 05:19.550]  certain people and only ones that were trusted so in even into the mid-2000
[05:19.550 --> 05:23.750]  range I was still being very quiet about what I was doing and a lot of
[05:23.750 --> 05:28.550]  strains got out because I wanted those strains to get out to the farmers that
[05:28.550 --> 05:34.790]  needed them but as some people do they didn't you know be forthcoming with that
[05:34.790 --> 05:40.190]  and made an advantage for themselves which ultimately brought me here because
[05:40.190 --> 05:46.630]  as we all know things come full circle you know and so this year my chili
[05:46.630 --> 05:56.140]  verde hit big at the Emerald Cup which thank you and so yeah that was a strain
[05:56.140 --> 05:59.900]  that actually came full circle when I released that in 2014 at the Emerald Cup
[05:59.900 --> 06:04.660]  I kind of took a beating on that strain at the time those strains the lavender
[06:04.660 --> 06:08.540]  was played out pretty heavily nobody was really interested in working with it
[06:08.540 --> 06:13.820]  then because they had driven it into the ground and the key lime pie was taking
[06:13.820 --> 06:18.860]  kind of not that great of reception because it was the cut of cookies that
[06:18.860 --> 06:22.820]  nobody really wanted to mess with and after I had done the work with it I was
[06:22.820 --> 06:26.020]  like wow this is something that really needs to get out to the public and I
[06:26.020 --> 06:30.260]  tried to kick and stomp and tell people and nobody really listened and then when
[06:30.260 --> 06:35.460]  I met Kevin for the seed series a few years back I brought a cut up and I was
[06:35.460 --> 06:40.260]  like hey you know this this is something you guys really need to check out and it
[06:40.260 --> 06:45.320]  took another two years and realistically as a breeder it's not just you breeding
[06:45.320 --> 06:49.520]  something amazing and saying hey this is what I've got it takes a community of
[06:49.520 --> 06:55.640]  people to get that out there to the public it wasn't it took several people
[06:55.640 --> 07:00.640]  with big social media accounts and and being able to get that strain out to
[07:00.640 --> 07:05.320]  customers who then told everybody hey you know this is this is amazing and
[07:05.320 --> 07:09.800]  then it created a buzz about that strain and that's something you kind of want to
[07:09.800 --> 07:13.960]  work with when you're working with your strains is make sure you have something
[07:13.960 --> 07:18.160]  that you can get out to the public and that public's then going to tell
[07:18.160 --> 07:22.760]  everybody hey you know this was amazing we want to work with this and that will
[07:22.760 --> 07:31.120]  then come back to you and and hopefully make your product more accessible and
[07:31.120 --> 07:35.960]  want people want that will want it the other thing is as a breeder you have to
[07:35.960 --> 07:40.120]  find your niche what are you doing are you creating a commercial brand that
[07:40.120 --> 07:43.760]  other farmers will then make a lot of money off of are you doing extract work
[07:43.800 --> 07:50.200]  are you doing heirloom preservation and a lot of that is acclimation to what
[07:50.200 --> 07:53.480]  you're doing so some people aren't don't have the ability to do heirloom
[07:53.480 --> 07:57.040]  preservation because some of those strains just don't work in your area and
[07:57.040 --> 08:01.960]  then with that so you kind of have to find your niche who are you working with
[08:01.960 --> 08:06.560]  who are you selling to if you're doing extraction work you know you're you got
[08:06.560 --> 08:10.240]  to find the ones that the extractors are wanting and it's really listically a
[08:10.320 --> 08:14.280]  two-year process being able to get those strains out there because the first year
[08:14.280 --> 08:17.640]  you're creating those strains then you're doing R&D research with those
[08:17.640 --> 08:22.120]  strains make sure they're even going to be acceptable and work with the people
[08:22.120 --> 08:26.320]  that are using them so you have strains that you create you think oh wow this is
[08:26.320 --> 08:29.080]  something that's got to be out there to the market but then you get it into
[08:29.080 --> 08:33.280]  commercial production and it doesn't transfer over well into the market
[08:33.280 --> 08:37.960]  because it's either fluffy and the public is like odd you know that's not
[08:37.960 --> 08:42.920]  what I wanted or the terpene profile isn't currently what's up to par with
[08:42.920 --> 08:48.080]  what everybody's looking for at that time so realistically two years prior
[08:48.080 --> 08:52.600]  you need to be thinking about well what what am I going to create that people
[08:52.600 --> 08:57.480]  are going to want two years from now because as a breeder you're not just
[08:57.480 --> 09:01.200]  going to make something right off the bat dump it on the market and everybody's
[09:01.200 --> 09:06.720]  going to get it not very many people have that accessibility to the general
[09:06.720 --> 09:12.200]  population to blow their strains up unless you have a multi-million dollar
[09:12.200 --> 09:19.880]  account with advertisers and social media so as a small based farm you
[09:19.880 --> 09:23.320]  really have to talk to your customers talk to the people that you're working
[09:23.320 --> 09:28.040]  with say hey what are you hearing from your people what do they want is it
[09:28.040 --> 09:33.800]  fruits is it is it oh geez is it gases is it autos and then from there start to
[09:33.800 --> 09:39.600]  create your plan of what you want to create and get out to the market what
[09:39.600 --> 09:42.160]  was this what you start with in the 90s what was your what was your beginning
[09:42.160 --> 09:47.640]  source material for your topicals that that was from Jamie I start working with
[09:47.640 --> 09:55.200]  Jamie at resin seats through advice through Ringo he we talked about CBD
[09:55.200 --> 10:02.000]  production and figuring out whether those would be more applicable to
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.000]  topical creams and once I started experimenting with that a little bit we
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.400]  started realizing that CBD was really what was where the topical applications
[10:15.400 --> 10:19.520]  were I've been making THC only creams for a while but I wasn't really
[10:19.520 --> 10:23.600]  getting getting the results that I really wanted and then once we started
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.360]  doing work with Ringo strains and then with Jamie from resin we really started
[10:28.360 --> 10:34.160]  to see a big boost in that but now the CBD market is really started to change
[10:34.160 --> 10:38.880]  if you are thinking about getting in the CBD game you have to really think about
[10:38.880 --> 10:44.800]  the new hemp production and how big that is and what they up will entail and if
[10:44.800 --> 10:49.400]  you are a small farm you might want to seriously think about one-to-ones that
[10:49.400 --> 10:55.600]  are even based because that is that that will get you a little bit farther in the
[10:55.600 --> 10:58.440]  game because you're not competing against multi-million dollar hemp
[10:58.440 --> 11:02.920]  productions well the thing that with with the with the new hemp laws FDA
[11:02.920 --> 11:08.400]  takes on him and under the under the farms and with hemp production you can
[11:08.400 --> 11:12.600]  make it into a product called we call it no back oh so it's not tobacco but you
[11:12.600 --> 11:16.600]  smoke it like it's tobacco and you can use it as topicals but under the in
[11:16.600 --> 11:21.340]  California the BCC regs is any cannabis that you use as consumption so if
[11:21.340 --> 11:25.520]  individuals that produce tincture based medicine it has to come through BCC
[11:25.600 --> 11:29.280]  regulations under that umbrella and that's something that's massive because
[11:29.280 --> 11:33.120]  most of the people who got into hemp really sold most of their product as an
[11:33.120 --> 11:36.880]  edible tincture if you went to any one of these stores it was 90% of the
[11:36.880 --> 11:41.080]  products sold were edible tinctures so everyone said oh man I'm gonna get into
[11:41.080 --> 11:46.320]  hemp I'm just gonna kill it and the FDA said sorry we want to do multiple
[11:46.320 --> 11:50.640]  licensing agreements so to speak where you get regulated as a hemp producer you
[11:50.640 --> 11:56.040]  can produce this but on this level you have to produce it under the BCC and so
[11:56.040 --> 12:00.400]  for Eric as a topical maker he can now source hemp material but if he was
[12:00.400 --> 12:04.880]  someone who was a tincture maker he's not allowed to use hemp as a derivative
[12:04.880 --> 12:08.840]  to make into that so if you're into any of these with holistic medicine you have
[12:08.840 --> 12:12.620]  to understand like where to source it and like he said with the 2014 when he
[12:12.620 --> 12:16.680]  released the chili Verde the gas was on fire like it's still on fire in the in
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.400]  the hot markets but everybody wanted fuel yeah it's the market changes so
[12:22.400 --> 12:26.280]  fast one day they want one thing one day the next day they want something else so
[12:26.280 --> 12:30.520]  diversify on what you're breeding try to get a little bit of array on where you're
[12:30.520 --> 12:37.080]  at the OG's the cheeses the gases the fruits they come and go and if you hold
[12:37.080 --> 12:40.480]  on to those stocks if you're ready and you're watching the market you'll be
[12:40.480 --> 12:45.120]  able to drop those and a lot of the older stuff comes around you know if you
[12:45.120 --> 12:49.640]  are primarily looking for the hottest thing in the market and you're like oh I
[12:49.640 --> 12:53.920]  got to have the skittle gelato right now you may be left behind because next year
[12:53.920 --> 12:58.880]  that it's not going to be the hottest thing and realistically in breeding
[12:58.880 --> 13:04.240]  programs get a good testing laboratory figure out where your numbers are every
[13:04.240 --> 13:09.560]  single breeding project that I do gets tested all those all those genetics I
[13:09.560 --> 13:13.360]  have to know whether I'm getting good terpene profiles what the terpene
[13:13.440 --> 13:17.600]  profiles are what the numbers on the percentages are and then from there that
[13:17.600 --> 13:21.440]  gives me a base on what I'm going to do with those plants as far as are they
[13:21.440 --> 13:26.320]  getting good nutrient uptake as the root structure good are the branches good and
[13:26.320 --> 13:31.920]  then from there I can start to go into how does it how does it harvest out how
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.520]  does it transfer over into the market and then from there how does the extract
[13:36.520 --> 13:41.280]  company come back to me and there's a lot of array of what you are looking for
[13:41.320 --> 13:45.040]  when you start to breed it's not just crossing the hottest thing with the
[13:45.040 --> 13:48.240]  hottest thing and then dropping those seeds in the market those are the guys
[13:48.240 --> 13:52.480]  that get in trouble because they're creating something that is based off
[13:52.480 --> 13:56.240]  something else and they're not doing the research and the time to develop the
[13:56.240 --> 14:01.640]  plant as a whole completely across the board I've made genetics before that I
[14:01.640 --> 14:05.160]  was like oh my god this is amazing I can't wait to get this out to the market
[14:05.160 --> 14:09.200]  but then when we would get it into certain areas they would burn up because
[14:09.200 --> 14:12.440]  the temperatures they couldn't handle hot temperatures or they can't handle
[14:12.440 --> 14:17.200]  cold temperatures or you harvest them and all the way through the growth the
[14:17.200 --> 14:22.460]  plant is just stinking amazingly you harvest it you cure it you get it in a
[14:22.460 --> 14:26.640]  bag and a jar and all of a sudden it's like oh there's nothing there those
[14:26.640 --> 14:33.120]  strains those are the ones you have to eliminate as you're going through the I
[14:33.280 --> 14:39.800]  got some bunch of friends from Europe and they're large industrial seed makers
[14:39.800 --> 14:43.400]  in Europe and we were having a conversation about the success of the
[14:43.400 --> 14:48.680]  variety ak-47 and we were talking about how when Simon did the breeding on it
[14:48.680 --> 14:52.400]  because he did huge populations of 10,000 to pull his pull his parental
[14:52.400 --> 14:56.120]  stock out of what it did and he had sourced all the material that he put
[14:56.120 --> 15:01.080]  together and he only did five strains total out of his catalog what it did was
[15:01.080 --> 15:06.600]  it let him take ak-47 and go into the genomic material and swing the direction
[15:06.600 --> 15:11.400]  that so if the market wanted it to be more this he could go into it and pull
[15:11.400 --> 15:15.640]  it and compete as a what we would call sativa one year he can compete as an
[15:15.640 --> 15:20.640]  indica another year he could compete as a mixed the year after all using the
[15:20.640 --> 15:25.800]  same genomic material because he had enough paint in that container to paint
[15:25.800 --> 15:29.960]  whatever picture he wanted from the tools that he had but ultimately it let
[15:29.960 --> 15:34.880]  him still keep pushing ak-47 every single time and I think that's what I
[15:34.880 --> 15:38.520]  ever saying is that you got to have a bigger picture and every one of the
[15:38.520 --> 15:41.040]  breeders you talk about they're gonna say the same similarity you have to have
[15:41.040 --> 15:45.280]  a bigger long-term picture of what it is you're trying to do because when you
[15:45.280 --> 15:49.280]  chase trends typically you catch the tail end of it it's kind of like stock
[15:49.280 --> 15:52.560]  where most people when they get into the stock they get in when they see it hot
[15:52.560 --> 15:56.320]  but by the time they get in it they're at the crest and then they make a buy
[15:56.320 --> 16:02.120]  and from that moment forward it's diminishing returns no water for you
[16:02.120 --> 16:10.160]  you got to stay dry and uncomfortable as possible on the stage is the key so you
[16:10.160 --> 16:14.720]  know Kevin Kevin is used to it he can talk forever on a mic this is like the
[16:14.720 --> 16:18.160]  third time I've ever actually been on the mic so it's kind of difficult for me
[16:18.160 --> 16:29.160]  but but we we brought you in to the last event and we bring you to this
[16:29.160 --> 16:33.320]  event because it's not on the mic that that it's where you do your work you
[16:33.320 --> 16:39.040]  know like for you you're you're a humble quiet guy and it was just the fact that
[16:39.040 --> 16:43.360]  you know you have a true love of what you do and some of the work you've done
[16:43.360 --> 16:47.840]  has been incredible and the HPK topicals have always been well received and your
[16:47.840 --> 16:52.240]  varieties are well received and as you're sitting here now you know what
[16:52.240 --> 16:55.680]  what what direction are you looking to go with what you're doing are you trying
[16:55.680 --> 17:00.720]  to find it you know hemp producers to work with to get cannabis to source like
[17:00.720 --> 17:05.960]  what do you do now as a topical manufacturer in 2019 now as a topical
[17:05.960 --> 17:11.840]  producer solely I have decided to kind of wait out to FDA figure out what they
[17:11.840 --> 17:16.080]  want to do with it we have some money set aside for FDA approval and licensing
[17:16.080 --> 17:21.360]  and then once they figure out what they want to do with hemp hopefully I'll be
[17:21.360 --> 17:25.640]  able to get some funding or financers to back me up on either creating my own
[17:25.640 --> 17:30.480]  production or finding somebody that we can partner up with to then pull that
[17:30.480 --> 17:35.720]  material in with the change in the hemp laws in California in July it kind of
[17:35.720 --> 17:41.640]  really set a lot of people back and it really hindered the consumer to find
[17:41.640 --> 17:45.000]  these products and now everybody's scrambling running around trying to
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.400]  figure it out and so a lot of us just have to be patient and I'm just being
[17:49.400 --> 17:54.680]  patient and waiting it out I've been developing my brand line I've been
[17:54.680 --> 17:59.840]  developing our testing to make sure that we're producing clean meds we just went
[17:59.840 --> 18:05.760]  through pesticide and microbial testing as well as potency and so that's always
[18:05.760 --> 18:10.040]  something I've been focused on is making sure I produce good clean meds but as
[18:10.040 --> 18:14.840]  far as a hemp market goes it's getting ready to blow up and I'm glad I'm
[18:14.840 --> 18:18.240]  kind of in a position to be able to take advantage of that but at the same
[18:18.240 --> 18:24.840]  time I'm not sure where I'm gonna be at at this moment it's kind of scary and so
[18:24.840 --> 18:28.960]  I see a lot of people out there struggling and worried and I'm with you
[18:28.960 --> 18:34.840]  I'm there you know so but yeah I'm really thankful that I did create a
[18:34.840 --> 18:41.920]  topical company in 2010 that I can now rely on and hopefully if we can be very
[18:41.920 --> 18:48.280]  successful that will then hopefully transfer over into me getting another
[18:48.280 --> 18:53.960]  farm license and creating my genetic brand again right now that's just kind
[18:53.960 --> 18:58.640]  of on the sideburn and yeah that's where it's at.
[18:58.640 --> 19:04.240]  It's awesome to see that you made the transition and I couldn't have been
[19:04.240 --> 19:08.040]  any happier when I saw you I saw you flower flash across the screen and I was
[19:08.040 --> 19:14.320]  like vindication. Yeah yeah nobody was that caught me off guard too and I was
[19:14.320 --> 19:19.600]  like yeah it was really nice to see that you know I spent so many years as a as a
[19:19.600 --> 19:25.200]  gorilla grower and in the black market in the early days that it's still really
[19:25.200 --> 19:29.760]  hard for some of us to come out and talk and tell people what we are doing and
[19:29.760 --> 19:34.920]  how we are doing it because it's still really scary for us the first time I
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.840]  talked with Kevin I broke down at the end you know it was really emotionally
[19:39.840 --> 19:46.440]  tough for me but as the industry is changing there are a lot of people like
[19:46.440 --> 19:53.960]  myself who are now finding out that even though we spent 25 years doing this the
[19:53.960 --> 19:59.600]  industry at some point they respect that but if you don't have an education
[19:59.600 --> 20:03.160]  behind you and a firm understanding of what you're doing and how you're doing
[20:03.200 --> 20:08.400]  it to to give that back to the public you will be left behind fast I've been
[20:08.400 --> 20:12.520]  told by several people lately that I'm over qualified and under qualified at
[20:12.520 --> 20:16.400]  the same time I dropped out of high school to grow cannabis in the early 90s
[20:16.400 --> 20:21.640]  and I spent 20 years in the bushes learning how to grow cannabis very well
[20:21.640 --> 20:27.040]  but recently I've had problems with the new industry that came in they wanted
[20:27.040 --> 20:32.520]  they want paperwork behind they want to know what kind of you know agricultural
[20:32.560 --> 20:36.240]  degrees I have what kind of plant science do you have what kind of college
[20:36.240 --> 20:42.520]  background do you have and that has been tough for me because I don't have that
[20:42.520 --> 20:48.120]  but I know how to grow amazing cannabis I know what the plant is like and and so
[20:48.120 --> 20:52.640]  courses like this the more you can get out there get that put onto your resume
[20:52.640 --> 20:57.960]  learn things that will help you down the road and I think the natural Korean
[20:57.960 --> 21:02.960]  organic farming will start to take over bigger in the commercial industry because
[21:02.960 --> 21:08.320]  a lot of these people are realizing that they don't want pharmaceutical products
[21:08.320 --> 21:13.200]  and when you're using nutrient salt based products those transfer over into
[21:13.200 --> 21:16.600]  the product that you're smoking and a lot of the consumers are now figuring
[21:16.600 --> 21:22.480]  that out so you see a decline in the hydro based markets and you can really
[21:22.480 --> 21:27.280]  start to learn how to get your natural Korean IMOs down you get your organics
[21:27.280 --> 21:32.080]  down you get your Google culture down that is only going to help later on
[21:32.080 --> 21:35.920]  down the road with your overall brand
[21:42.380 --> 21:45.980]  during questions
[21:45.980 --> 22:05.420]  is there a market for flowers or is it totally dominated by extracts pictures
[22:05.420 --> 22:15.900]  let's create the market no in an answer no but that's because what happened
[22:15.900 --> 22:22.140]  with cannabis was a travesty occurred and the laboratory was created and no
[22:22.140 --> 22:27.380]  one really understood how to use the lab and so what they find is a 20 must be
[22:27.380 --> 22:33.140]  better than a 10 and 5 terp is better than 3 terp and so all of a sudden this
[22:33.140 --> 22:39.940]  perception of numerics became value and the customer started to believe that if
[22:39.940 --> 22:46.180]  I spend 40 bucks for a bag and it's a 28 it's going to give me more usage than
[22:46.180 --> 22:51.740]  a $40 bag that's 22 and so it's a perception of efficiency and dosage
[22:51.740 --> 22:56.260]  usage so titration how much I consume based off what the numerics are and the
[22:56.260 --> 23:00.340]  problem is is that nobody really was able to get the education out quick
[23:00.340 --> 23:07.940]  enough because it was a new industry and so this incredible dumbing down occurred
[23:08.100 --> 23:12.140]  to where people don't really understand that what they want to do is consume a
[23:12.140 --> 23:17.740]  product that gives them satisfaction and efficacy and that's not necessarily
[23:17.740 --> 23:23.020]  numerically connected and so over the course of time you'll see those products
[23:23.020 --> 23:27.860]  rise up and move forward but right now you're having to fight an uphill battle
[23:27.860 --> 23:31.820]  to advertise it and I think that what's going to save us is that the people that
[23:31.820 --> 23:35.540]  are coming into cannabis who aren't caught up in numbers and aren't caught
[23:35.540 --> 23:41.180]  up in the past of cannabis they're going to want good cannabis and so I use
[23:41.180 --> 23:45.620]  people who are very light smokers that are extremely heavily affected by THC
[23:45.620 --> 23:51.380]  Dom stuff and I try to find interesting ratios interesting turf profiles and
[23:51.380 --> 23:57.300]  that they're happy with because we can't be used as the test case because we're
[23:57.300 --> 24:03.820]  basically immune to normal smoke so we're bad as a tester for that yeah we
[24:03.820 --> 24:08.820]  are bad yardstick so you know I think that that's the case and but for like
[24:08.820 --> 24:13.620]  what he does with it with the topical blends and stuff that's a different usage
[24:13.620 --> 24:19.660]  just like with the extracts or the tinctures because that is about ratios
[24:19.660 --> 24:24.140]  cannabinoids turf profiles in a form where the people that are buying it
[24:24.140 --> 24:27.580]  aren't looking at the numbers some of the most successful stuff we sold almost
[24:27.580 --> 24:31.580]  had zero numbers. Well and right now there's a big shift in what's in the
[24:31.580 --> 24:34.740]  market that's about to happen because you have the Central Valley getting
[24:34.740 --> 24:39.820]  ready to come on with major hemp production and when you are a farmer if
[24:39.820 --> 24:45.380]  you cannot farm 20 acres or more of hemp you will not stay in the game when you
[24:45.380 --> 24:51.180]  are making concentrates or isolates or distillates from those you need to be
[24:51.180 --> 24:56.460]  big in the game at this point now when it comes to the cannabis industry you
[24:56.460 --> 25:00.620]  still have a lot of leeway as a smaller farmer you can still work with that but
[25:00.660 --> 25:05.020]  as the Central Valley comes online you better be ready to compete with those
[25:05.020 --> 25:08.820]  guys because they're going to be dumping massive amounts and the general consumer
[25:08.820 --> 25:14.660]  population south of Sacramento realistically they don't really the big
[25:14.660 --> 25:19.340]  cartridge market is big with CBD but the general consumer is not really looking
[25:19.340 --> 25:23.860]  for flour that tests less than 20% because they're not really smoking it
[25:23.860 --> 25:27.860]  everybody that's looking for it is concentrating it down and then selling
[25:27.860 --> 25:31.100]  it to the people that are making products like myself and like myself
[25:31.100 --> 25:35.100]  it's easier and cheaper to buy isolate than it is to try to buy a pound of
[25:35.100 --> 25:39.340]  flour and then concentrate it down and to make it into my products that way so
[25:39.340 --> 25:44.700]  I told somebody recently that was asking on the hey what's up gargle now page
[25:44.700 --> 25:48.860]  about growing hemp this year or CBD and I said you know you might want to
[25:48.860 --> 25:52.700]  seriously think about staying with craft cannabis because once the Central Valley
[25:52.860 --> 25:57.620]  and the hemp initiative comes online you're gonna be going up against
[25:57.620 --> 26:01.420]  multi-million dollar contracts and I don't know if you're seeing that now but
[26:01.420 --> 26:06.060]  down in the Central Valley where I'm at they are hot about going big well I mean
[26:06.060 --> 26:11.140]  I'm I'm doing consultant work in like relationship work and in Colorado you're
[26:11.140 --> 26:17.860]  talking thousand acres thousand acre farm is a norm and that's frightening you
[26:17.860 --> 26:22.460]  know that's a tough one to compete against my buddy knows a guy that is the
[26:22.460 --> 26:28.420]  largest hops producer in Washington his only client is an heiser bush so he
[26:28.420 --> 26:35.100]  sells to one person only and he has a robotic automated hops farm and he has a
[26:35.100 --> 26:39.980]  30 million dollar extraction unit that does the extract and he can do 20,000
[26:39.980 --> 26:46.020]  pounds an hour of extract and he showed me a jar of hops diamonds and and hops
[26:46.020 --> 26:49.580]  turps and I said what the hell is that he goes tops bro and I said what are you
[26:49.620 --> 26:52.700]  guys doing it with that he goes that's how we sell it to Budweiser they don't
[26:52.700 --> 26:55.220]  they don't buy it they buy it as an extract and they add it to their beer
[26:55.220 --> 27:01.900]  mix and it blew my mind to see a 30 million dollar extraction device
[27:01.900 --> 27:09.140]  robotic sorters robotic sifting the hemp industry is gonna basically be corn and
[27:09.140 --> 27:14.100]  the part of it that won't be will be in the edible form because the FDA won't
[27:14.100 --> 27:17.820]  let you consume that they'll let you put it on your body and they'll let you smoke
[27:17.900 --> 27:22.180]  it but they won't let you consume it and so it's the for you as an individual
[27:22.180 --> 27:24.340]  where if you wanted this we've talked about genetics early if you want to
[27:24.340 --> 27:28.220]  stratify what you're doing then you produce things that are going to catch
[27:28.220 --> 27:33.460]  the ethereal market mental market lift and then you catch the stuff of people
[27:33.460 --> 27:37.380]  who want to have health and wellness and that means that part of your product
[27:37.380 --> 27:43.020]  diversity could be CBD material but CBD and ratios that work with turp profiles
[27:43.020 --> 27:47.380]  that work that lets you do some form of efficient cold extraction so that you're
[27:47.380 --> 27:52.340]  able to actually get product out that goes under your label that lets people
[27:52.340 --> 27:57.500]  who use your label now see that you're valid there and move forward when I was
[27:57.500 --> 28:01.140]  involved in all the initial release of CBD in the United States so I'm one of
[28:01.140 --> 28:04.140]  the first people to touch CBD and I definitely released more CBD than
[28:04.140 --> 28:06.540]  anybody probably than the Stanley brothers and they're working off the
[28:06.540 --> 28:12.940]  stuff they bootlegged from us so the point of this is that I saw the
[28:12.940 --> 28:17.180]  evolution of this and people asked me why did you give up so much material for
[28:17.300 --> 28:23.660]  free and I said because when you have a necessity you have a validity and if we
[28:23.660 --> 28:28.980]  can get people to use CBD medicine and get it fairly priced in my case free
[28:28.980 --> 28:33.060]  what happens is they see all of us as cannabis producers differently they
[28:33.060 --> 28:36.780]  realize that we're not social pariah that we were painted to be and if
[28:36.780 --> 28:41.380]  mainstream people can use a product and use a topical from Eric and say man that
[28:41.380 --> 28:47.020]  made a radical difference in the quality of my health he's valid when their son
[28:47.140 --> 28:51.260]  comes in and said they sell weed too I don't know let's look it up and all of a
[28:51.260 --> 28:54.780]  sudden they become your brand ambassador because what you've done is you've taken
[28:54.780 --> 28:59.740]  away somebody's arthritis my mother who was a staunch anti-cannabis individual
[28:59.740 --> 29:05.740]  where this shit was demonic when she got cancer I was able to help her with CBD
[29:05.740 --> 29:09.580]  medicine and my mother is now this cannabis advocate that's almost
[29:09.580 --> 29:12.620]  hysterical because she's in every single thing I'm doing everybody she's talking
[29:12.620 --> 29:17.000]  to and they're like boy your mother's so pro cannabis and I said because it did
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.200]  something for her that changed her opinion and because of it she realized
[29:21.200 --> 29:25.400]  that she had chosen wrongly in a judgment so she reversed her decision
[29:25.400 --> 29:29.760]  and now she tries to utilize that education and knowledge to help people
[29:29.760 --> 29:33.680]  and that's really where you take a look at some of the CBD pieces because the
[29:33.680 --> 29:38.120]  tremendous amount of people that need that are far more than need to consume
[29:38.120 --> 29:43.320]  it and smoke and when you touch that population and you do it elegantly and
[29:43.320 --> 29:47.800]  graciously it changes how not only do they view you but they view all of us
[29:47.800 --> 29:50.920]  that way and what I wanted to do is I wanted to be able to continue in
[29:50.920 --> 29:53.920]  cannabis my whole career and the only way I was gonna be able to do that is if
[29:53.920 --> 29:56.800]  I could get the mainstream not to see me as somebody that they wanted to put in
[29:56.800 --> 30:01.440]  prison perpetually and the only way that can happen is if you have a value and so
[30:01.440 --> 30:04.960]  you have these abilities but you have to be very intelligent about how much of
[30:04.960 --> 30:10.760]  your product are you selling in that form so some small portion of CBD two to
[30:10.760 --> 30:14.920]  ones one to ones high terp levels so that there's aromatic because on cold
[30:14.920 --> 30:18.440]  extractions it's this whole synthesis that actually gives you the efficacy
[30:18.440 --> 30:23.160]  that you're seeking and you make so that it works for you you can put it under
[30:23.160 --> 30:27.520]  your label it augments what you do as a flower producer so you get to do your
[30:27.520 --> 30:32.080]  flower you get to catch a medical market and you stay out of commercial hemp
[30:32.080 --> 30:37.640]  unless you are a real farmer where you're talking silos and you're talking
[30:37.640 --> 30:42.120]  John Deere equipment because you're gonna compete with some Giants is there
[30:42.120 --> 30:54.240]  any anybody with questions that pertain to breeding I know you're at yeah we do
[30:54.240 --> 30:59.480]  actually it depends I'll let you take that you see more of that than I do
[30:59.480 --> 31:04.440]  well totally I see it but but see what when when you're doing what he's doing
[31:04.440 --> 31:10.200]  what he said what he says I see a quality and as someone who's got career
[31:10.200 --> 31:15.920]  time where I've spent 20 25 years doing it I know that this is a quality product
[31:15.920 --> 31:20.800]  and I know that if it was presented in the right form it would sell and then
[31:20.800 --> 31:25.120]  what you have to do then is be able to figure out where it belongs and seasonal
[31:25.120 --> 31:31.360]  shifts are based off of media hype based off a good advertising based off of
[31:31.360 --> 31:34.760]  things that are usually bigger than you and what you want to do is you want to
[31:34.760 --> 31:39.120]  create a portfolio of things that allow you to fill those holes as they open and
[31:39.120 --> 31:42.800]  when they close you just retract and put something else in and so good breeders
[31:42.800 --> 31:46.280]  are gonna work up variety of lines but not so many that they don't have
[31:46.280 --> 31:49.600]  control of what they're doing and what it does it allows you to deal with the
[31:49.600 --> 31:52.880]  realities of human nature where they don't always want the same thing every
[31:52.880 --> 31:57.480]  day but they don't want too many different things and where you live is a
[31:57.840 --> 32:02.280]  huge situation for that where if you're in Southern California it's exclusiveness
[32:02.280 --> 32:06.840]  so it's things that nobody has so as soon as it gets out it's no longer
[32:06.840 --> 32:11.240]  trendy and if I take a picture of myself smoking it I'm not that sexy but if no
[32:11.240 --> 32:15.760]  one else has it I'm incredible and so the ability to understand the mentality
[32:15.760 --> 32:19.600]  of how things move and work is huge but that's why I like what Eric does is
[32:19.600 --> 32:24.720]  because the stuff that he worked with that I used he had done years prior and
[32:24.880 --> 32:30.720]  it hadn't lost its appeal and so the quality of the work still resonated
[32:30.720 --> 32:35.320]  because his desire to create a quality product was there and his knowledge of
[32:35.320 --> 32:39.560]  what the market wanted was there and now the question is how do we move it into
[32:39.560 --> 32:44.560]  the right locations and that's where you have to have this this organic group so
[32:44.560 --> 32:48.400]  that you as a cultivator can say hey wait a second my shit's not trendy right
[32:48.400 --> 32:51.720]  now and you find out somebody that I got the trendy stuff I'll hook you up and
[32:51.720 --> 32:56.880]  then you're able to catch the hole fill the need get the check continue forward
[32:56.880 --> 33:00.720]  and then next year your stuff is sexy again right and that's kind of as a
[33:00.720 --> 33:04.680]  breeder you have to make a decision on what you're doing for me I have specific
[33:04.680 --> 33:10.320]  lines that I work and I stay within I am NOT a trend I'm not I'm not following
[33:10.320 --> 33:15.080]  the hottest trend I have specific lines that I work that I like that work for me
[33:15.080 --> 33:19.760]  and that's where I stay at and I have a lot of people that look at my menu and
[33:19.760 --> 33:23.760]  they say hey there's no skittles on here there's no gelato there's you know
[33:23.760 --> 33:27.480]  they're where's all these strains and I said well that's not what I work with I
[33:27.480 --> 33:32.800]  work specifically in certain things and you have to make a decision as a breeder
[33:32.800 --> 33:37.120]  and what you're going to breed are you going to be trying to just follow
[33:37.120 --> 33:42.160]  everybody else are you working your specific lines and how those lines work
[33:42.160 --> 33:52.560]  for you so I've been working with the same genetics since the early 2000s
[34:00.160 --> 34:05.640]  that you have to make a decision whether so what he's asking is he's asking he's
[34:05.640 --> 34:10.240]  holding some clonal stock that's local that he's had forever but they're clonal
[34:10.240 --> 34:15.240]  stock and now he wants to create seed from those clonal stock so what you have
[34:15.240 --> 34:18.880]  to do is you have to make a decision do you want to you can make you can make
[34:18.880 --> 34:23.920]  them and I see from those by spraying them and making seed stock from those or
[34:23.920 --> 34:29.200]  you can cross pollinate those with a male that you brought in or you can do a
[34:29.200 --> 34:34.840]  sub cross try to pheno hunt back out those lines and then use those genetics
[34:34.840 --> 34:40.600]  to make your own stock with that's kind of the only problem with that is that
[34:40.600 --> 34:46.400]  the genetic package that you're holding sometimes is unique so how many times
[34:46.400 --> 34:53.320]  do your parents have to recreate a child to get you a lot and so if it's cannabis
[34:53.320 --> 34:56.960]  varieties that have specific properties and we have a variety that seemed to
[34:56.960 --> 34:59.880]  work for specificity and so I tell people that's the one thing I'm never
[34:59.880 --> 35:03.400]  going to get rid of because it has a power that I haven't seen in any other
[35:03.480 --> 35:07.520]  varietal because across the board it works for a thing and I tried to
[35:07.520 --> 35:12.520]  substitute everything to find out something that was similar and it didn't
[35:12.520 --> 35:15.200]  matter and I don't think we're intelligent enough at this point to
[35:15.200 --> 35:18.960]  understand these little intricate details because the synergy of the
[35:18.960 --> 35:24.640]  turps cannabinoids oils relationship between bacteria all those things create
[35:24.640 --> 35:30.400]  too much information to be able to just say it's that so what I know is you take
[35:30.520 --> 35:36.040]  that and self it hold the material keep the clone if it is priceless keep the
[35:36.040 --> 35:39.960]  clone you can people have huge collections but I'm like what are you
[35:39.960 --> 35:44.800]  collecting for some things just are generic but some things like if you have
[35:44.800 --> 35:48.000]  something that you collected that you said man this is my core thing I love it
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.920]  I just wish I could hold it and not have to play with it you might just find that
[35:51.920 --> 35:56.160]  the real truth of it is is that hold it in some seed form where you have some of
[35:56.160 --> 36:00.160]  the genetic material and hold the clone don't get rid of the clone because this
[36:00.160 --> 36:04.160]  clones that I've had that I cannot replace I don't give a shit how many
[36:04.160 --> 36:07.080]  seeds I go through I can't find him there's guy in the back that's been
[36:07.080 --> 36:21.320]  grabbing it from it long-term question was about long-term seed storage that
[36:21.320 --> 36:26.600]  that's kind of that's opening a can of worms for me sort of because I'll take
[36:26.600 --> 36:32.400]  some abuse on this but for me I don't like to freeze long-term freeze my
[36:32.400 --> 36:36.320]  seeds because I've had bad problems with that later on down the road because as a
[36:36.320 --> 36:41.440]  as a general consumer I can only buy the freezer that's on the market and the
[36:41.440 --> 36:45.480]  power goes out or that breaks down I'm struggling to try to get those seeds
[36:45.480 --> 36:54.000]  refrozen again so for me what I like to do is I'll store them in in sealed jars
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.720]  in dark area and just below room temperature and I've never had problems
[36:59.720 --> 37:05.080]  with my seed stock lasting you know for I've had seed stock for 10-15 years it
[37:05.080 --> 37:11.240]  still popped within 24 hours what happens is a lot of people will miss
[37:11.240 --> 37:15.480]  store their seeds by freezing them and when you're opening and closing the door
[37:15.480 --> 37:19.680]  constantly or pulling those that whole entire seat batch out you go through all
[37:19.680 --> 37:23.960]  your seeds they defrost and you put them back in the freezer sometimes that has
[37:23.960 --> 37:28.120]  a longevity issue and you will degrade your seeds but I have other breeder
[37:28.120 --> 37:33.840]  friends that swear by only keeping them fully frozen all the time it's it's a
[37:33.840 --> 37:39.680]  personal issue with you but heat will screw up your seeds you get up above 80
[37:39.680 --> 37:44.480]  90 degrees and it's prolonged your seeds are not gonna last long that's just
[37:44.480 --> 37:49.400]  from personal experience living in SoCal well the moisture fluctuations screw you
[37:49.400 --> 37:53.920]  to where you you you you get the seed to get moisture in it and it activates
[37:53.920 --> 37:57.920]  the enzymes and then you reach ill it and dry it and it deactivates it except
[37:57.920 --> 38:01.240]  if you utilize some of it and if you repeat that process a couple times
[38:01.240 --> 38:05.420]  there's not much left in the seed and so we can go into the lab and we can go in
[38:05.420 --> 38:09.840]  vitro and get into the seed but the problem is that it's just like with
[38:09.840 --> 38:14.080]  tissue culture there the number of mediums that you have to use to find the
[38:14.080 --> 38:19.200]  right base formulation usually is around 10 so if you're trying to do a TC
[38:19.200 --> 38:22.880]  op you've got at least 10 base formulations you use you find the one
[38:22.880 --> 38:27.240]  that's closest from there you start to refine and that's why it takes so long
[38:27.240 --> 38:30.160]  to do tissue culture with cannabis is because you don't have a recipe book you
[38:30.160 --> 38:33.920]  can pop up like for orchid so I can pop up a book and I can pull out a recipe
[38:33.920 --> 38:37.320]  and say this has been formulated by these scientists from Duke and they say
[38:37.320 --> 38:41.120]  use this well cannabis you don't have that and anybody who does is holding
[38:41.120 --> 38:44.680]  that shit in their pocket because it's a lot of work so I'm trying to crack
[38:44.680 --> 38:49.960]  seeds from the 70s that I know haven't been held right but I know that there's
[38:49.960 --> 38:55.680]  still enough material to salvage and it's just a process for the labs to be
[38:55.680 --> 38:59.900]  able to create the auger solution and the hormonal concentrations to allow it
[38:59.900 --> 39:04.240]  to open up and start to move so they can get cellular activity so they can
[39:04.240 --> 39:09.360]  harvest some form of cell that they can then micro propagate that and go forward
[39:09.360 --> 39:14.920]  but you know for the average person you know to scrub a plant at lowest cost at
[39:14.920 --> 39:19.840]  six grand for a meristem scrub average is ten so if every plant you touch is
[39:19.840 --> 39:25.160]  ten grand I mean let's eat it's kind of costly and so like for me holding seeds
[39:25.160 --> 39:28.680]  it with the difference I think too is that when you're someone who makes seeds
[39:28.680 --> 39:33.600]  you're taking them to fruition and you are running the mothers till the seeds
[39:33.600 --> 39:38.480]  are completely fully stacked with carbohydrates so you have a true time
[39:38.560 --> 39:43.400]  capsule then he takes this seed that was fully developed and then he holds it at
[39:43.400 --> 39:48.120]  a humidity level and a temperature range that buffers it when you go buy a pack
[39:48.120 --> 39:52.720]  of seeds if it's a trendy seed half of them are white because the money's there
[39:52.720 --> 39:55.400]  so yeah they might crack but they're not gonna hold because they weren't
[39:55.400 --> 39:58.760]  developed enough so they don't have a large enough sugar storage within them
[39:58.760 --> 40:03.120]  to be able to give you what you need and so for guys like Eric that are seed
[40:03.120 --> 40:07.580]  makers they have a far better ability to preserve seed than the average person
[40:07.580 --> 40:10.620]  because the average person doesn't realize that that plant has to basically
[40:10.620 --> 40:16.180]  look like shit when you harvest those seeds the you are taking it way past the
[40:16.180 --> 40:21.420]  visual beauty because you're harvesting seed now once you do that I would
[40:21.420 --> 40:25.780]  recommend you run a desiccant pack and you put them in a seal a meal and that
[40:25.780 --> 40:28.980]  way you can seal them up so that you're not having any infiltration and it keeps
[40:28.980 --> 40:33.160]  them nice and flat and what it does it lets you stack them up in a bin and if
[40:33.160 --> 40:37.220]  you can put them in a cellar or a basement or a cold storage it's how it's
[40:37.220 --> 40:40.740]  done historically so I don't like these I don't like the freezers either because
[40:40.740 --> 40:46.820]  I've always had power problems and so unless you have a full-time power supply
[40:46.820 --> 40:52.300]  there's an issue and people talk about oh it's possible but I watched the
[40:52.300 --> 40:57.380]  scientists running out of a seed bank in Antarctica with paper boxes with the
[40:57.380 --> 41:00.940]  most valuable genomic material on earth running for their fucking lives and I
[41:00.940 --> 41:03.940]  said well they spent a hundred million dollars to build that and they're
[41:03.940 --> 41:08.140]  putting things in paper bags running for their lives the odds of me getting
[41:08.140 --> 41:13.780]  around that probably pretty slim so I kind of looking at the way he does where
[41:13.780 --> 41:20.620]  I try to hold material but I hold it in sealed seal meals so that I can flatten
[41:20.620 --> 41:24.300]  them out so that I can hold more material other than big containers of
[41:24.300 --> 41:30.100]  jars and if I could do it correctly when I do the sealing on it I seal up a
[41:30.100 --> 41:33.900]  second pack that's small so if I want to pull something out and play with it I
[41:33.900 --> 41:37.580]  can I don't have to open up the whole package otherwise what I'm doing is I'm
[41:37.580 --> 41:41.780]  cracking the whole pack and now you have to go through the process again every
[41:41.780 --> 41:45.580]  time we open it up we expose it to oxygen we expose it to change in
[41:45.580 --> 41:50.160]  humidity and if we humidify this we activate the enzymes we start the
[41:50.160 --> 41:54.780]  biological process and then we have to shorten it it doesn't work.
[41:54.780 --> 41:58.740]  One of the things I like to do too is I'll do an initial 24-hour freeze right
[41:58.740 --> 42:03.140]  after harvest and we shuck and clean the seeds they will get frozen for 24 hours
[42:03.140 --> 42:07.340]  and for me it's kind of it's kind of like winter set in it's told that seed
[42:07.340 --> 42:12.500]  that yeah it tells that seed that winter's come it's ready and then as you
[42:12.500 --> 42:16.860]  pull it out of that 24-hour freeze then it goes into our humidity packs where
[42:16.860 --> 42:20.660]  we're putting them away at just below room temperature so that seed has been
[42:20.660 --> 42:25.340]  gone through its full cycle so it's you you've bred it it's gone through the
[42:25.340 --> 42:29.220]  full cycle you've harvested it winter has been it's you know it's gone through
[42:29.220 --> 42:34.380]  its winter cycle and now it's ready to be propagated once you're ready for that
[42:34.380 --> 42:38.940]  so initial 24-hour freeze for me has always kind of been initial but I always
[42:38.940 --> 42:42.660]  like to make sure they're clean before we freeze them because I don't like to
[42:42.660 --> 42:45.940]  have plant material in there because the plant material I've noticed will pull in
[42:45.940 --> 42:49.860]  moisture. And I learned you know years ago from people that were running
[42:49.860 --> 42:53.700]  mountain varieties that they vernalize before they cracked so they would take
[42:53.700 --> 42:58.580]  the seed they would do a cold treatment and then soak it cold and then it's
[42:58.580 --> 43:01.980]  stimulated growth because that was the natural genomic pattern of the varietals
[43:01.980 --> 43:05.940]  but stuff that was equatorial was opposite was higher higher warmth
[43:05.940 --> 43:10.260]  levels so depending on you know where your original stock comes from you have
[43:10.260 --> 43:16.460]  different strategies but the main thing is to make sure that you're doing enough
[43:16.460 --> 43:21.340]  preservation and you have enough seed that you're able to actually go back in
[43:21.340 --> 43:25.180]  and mine and people that are doing really work a good work on this what
[43:25.180 --> 43:29.060]  they're doing is they're refreshing this population every five years you
[43:29.060 --> 43:32.380]  just can't put stuff away for the rest of your life you have to basically go
[43:32.380 --> 43:36.540]  back in and then do an open pollination with your stock where you're taking a
[43:36.540 --> 43:39.540]  variety of males and a variety of females so that you're picking up as
[43:39.540 --> 43:44.260]  much genetic material as possible and then when you go back into it you can
[43:44.260 --> 43:49.300]  steer the direction you want based off the needs that you have then.
[43:49.620 --> 43:54.820]  I was just wondering what characteristics you really look for when choosing your males?
[43:54.820 --> 44:00.340]  In a very small outdoor situation where you don't have a lot of separate space, where do you put them?
[44:00.340 --> 44:02.340]  Do you leave them white neptune?
[44:02.340 --> 44:04.340]  How do you handle them?
[44:04.340 --> 44:11.420]  You know that's kind of personal preference also when selecting males I'm kind of looking for
[44:11.420 --> 44:16.500]  certain traits that I want to add into my females so either structure or I'm
[44:16.500 --> 44:23.340]  looking for colors or I'm looking for terpene profiles or I'm looking for
[44:23.340 --> 44:29.860]  diversity as far as nutrient uptake or a stability as far as heat, stress, mold
[44:29.860 --> 44:34.220]  things like that and that comes with a little bit of trial and error so a lot
[44:34.220 --> 44:37.900]  of breeders will do open pollination so they have a little bit of diversity so
[44:37.900 --> 44:44.660]  that they're not choosing just one male to make their population with.
[44:44.700 --> 44:49.180]  Pre-testing them, that's why I have a lab, I'll go through and pre-test my males.
[44:49.180 --> 44:52.860]  You'll actually have a THC content in your males and you can kind of tell through
[44:52.860 --> 45:00.380]  diversity of how far you think that male will pull your THC content to a plant
[45:00.380 --> 45:04.340]  because I've tested males and they show very little.
[45:04.340 --> 45:09.740]  Anywhere after six to eight weeks but normally I'll wait until they start to drop pollen.
[45:09.740 --> 45:14.140]  I'll cut some of those pollen sacks with some of the leaf stem material and
[45:14.140 --> 45:18.060]  then I'll send that in and ask for a potency test and that kind of gives me a
[45:18.060 --> 45:23.020]  low ratio of what I'm doing and I like to use my test to figure out where my
[45:23.020 --> 45:28.900]  ratio is on what I'm doing but realistically you'll know when you find
[45:28.900 --> 45:32.060]  your males and you're going through them there will be certain males that are not
[45:32.060 --> 45:35.420]  doing as well or they don't have as good a structure or they just don't have that
[45:35.420 --> 45:40.020]  smell that you're looking for and you can kind of eliminate them out.
[45:40.060 --> 45:45.460]  When you're getting into big pheno hunts then kind of some things change on that but
[45:45.460 --> 45:51.620]  holding a males on a small property with a small section can be tough.
[45:51.620 --> 45:56.060]  You almost want a separate greenhouse that you can seal off or an indoor where you can
[45:56.060 --> 46:01.060]  keep them separated or work with a friend who has a six plant license and
[46:01.060 --> 46:05.100]  you can throw some males at their place and it's not going to populate anybody
[46:05.100 --> 46:07.420]  in their surrounding area.
[46:07.460 --> 46:10.780]  Yeah that's why breeding is so tough because you have to almost dedicate
[46:10.780 --> 46:14.460]  yourself to breeding or not breeding.
[46:14.460 --> 46:18.860]  People that try to side breed end up with a lot of material that ends up with seed later on
[46:18.860 --> 46:23.980]  and then your customers are like hey I got some seeds what's up?
[46:23.980 --> 46:25.980]  You know?
[46:28.980 --> 46:34.140]  As a quick one like what I would people were having problems because their
[46:34.140 --> 46:38.020]  varietals didn't have enough numerics and so I said look let me sift you out
[46:38.020 --> 46:41.540]  some males to make this happen because it's easy because I'm gonna sift
[46:41.540 --> 46:48.100]  for a specific trait and so I can do a say I crack 200 seeds within a week or
[46:48.100 --> 46:52.300]  two of growth and I have my first true leaf after the coidal Eden I can take a
[46:52.300 --> 46:57.660]  stamp and sex them and call out all my females right because I'm only looking
[46:57.660 --> 47:01.380]  for males then I can let these males grow up till they're about eight to ten
[47:01.380 --> 47:04.420]  inches and I can take the top four inches off and send it into a lab for
[47:04.420 --> 47:08.340]  predicated analysis. Their predicated analysis is going to tell me right at
[47:08.340 --> 47:15.340]  that moment what are my THC, CBD, CBG levels and in ratios. I always look for
[47:15.340 --> 47:18.460]  high CBG levels because that's the base cannabinoid all cannabinoids are
[47:18.460 --> 47:22.420]  converted from so if I'm looking at numbers and I have a huge CBG reserve I
[47:22.420 --> 47:26.900]  know there's a lot more left in the tank and then I can look at these ratios and
[47:26.900 --> 47:31.220]  I can say okay we're in a ratio that we like and we have disproportionate totals
[47:31.220 --> 47:36.420]  we start to use that population of males to go into other plants that I
[47:36.420 --> 47:41.420]  want to increase and then I measure the progeny the children did I increase what
[47:41.420 --> 47:45.820]  I wanted to increase and then we're able to find out which male through the stamp
[47:45.820 --> 47:51.300]  then I can take that population do it again and I can start narrowing down the
[47:51.300 --> 47:56.340]  amount of plants it takes me to get into a specific characteristic and I was
[47:56.340 --> 48:01.420]  going after numbers heavily for people that I they needed to sell pot and if
[48:01.420 --> 48:04.140]  you're in the dispensary business and you don't have numbers that are real
[48:04.140 --> 48:08.140]  you're screwed and so what I did is I use the same tools we used to go from
[48:08.140 --> 48:15.580]  5% CBD to 20% CBD in a year to basically do with THC plants so it let me get a
[48:15.580 --> 48:19.140]  hold of material that I knew could throw heavy numbers on something and then I
[48:19.140 --> 48:23.180]  gave those males to people who wanted to get into breeding because they had an
[48:23.180 --> 48:26.380]  incredible collection but they were working with varietals that were 14 to
[48:26.380 --> 48:31.220]  17 and I needed to get them up to 27 so we found can we find males that
[48:31.220 --> 48:36.620]  consistently added one thing which was numerics and then from the numeric
[48:36.620 --> 48:41.140]  population you pull out the quality so ultimately it's always this sifting
[48:41.140 --> 48:44.980]  process that you're going through but lab analytics are helping credibly and
[48:44.980 --> 48:48.940]  now with marker assisted breeding and the ability to look at the plant to say
[48:48.940 --> 48:52.660]  you know how homozygous or heterozygous is it meaning how much of the trade is
[48:52.660 --> 48:56.820]  going to be carried and moved it helps you because if there's too much
[48:56.820 --> 49:00.580]  diversity then you're having to do too big a population hunt and for regular
[49:00.580 --> 49:06.780]  people that's a lot of work. It's expensive too so every time you guys all
[49:06.780 --> 49:11.420]  know what testing costs so every time you throw in a lab test you know 100 200
[49:11.420 --> 49:17.700]  300 bucks and so as a breeder for me it gets very expensive and in some points
[49:17.700 --> 49:22.220]  so yeah so when somebody says hey I'm asking this much for a pack of seeds
[49:22.220 --> 49:27.100]  that's kind of why. You keep asking this question.
[49:30.540 --> 49:38.300]  I'm looking for if I'm doing what I was doing at that time all
[49:38.300 --> 49:44.420]  like just like with CBD all we cared about was increasing CBD levels because
[49:44.420 --> 49:49.380]  the numbers were too low so once I get a population of plants that produce a
[49:49.500 --> 49:54.380]  higher overall level of CBD now I can go through those populations and do my
[49:54.380 --> 49:58.660]  resistance testing I can do my production testing but I can get every
[49:58.660 --> 50:04.300]  other quality I want and if it's 3% CBD I failed and so with marketable cannabis
[50:04.300 --> 50:09.500]  in today's industry I needed up in these higher numbers 28 to 30. Well I went into
[50:09.500 --> 50:14.300]  some of these chem lines and I started spending some time using predicated lab
[50:14.300 --> 50:18.020]  analysis which just lets me all it all it means is that I'm doing testing in
[50:18.020 --> 50:24.820]  juvenile stages and with CBD plants it's not as cement meaning that with THC
[50:24.820 --> 50:29.900]  the numbers stay pretty consistent but with CBD sometimes you end up having as
[50:29.900 --> 50:36.580]  the plant matures ratios shift a little bit not as not as accurate but with
[50:36.580 --> 50:42.100]  predicated THC analysis I see a higher level of accuracy with CBD we saw less
[50:42.100 --> 50:48.740]  but the bottom line is if I'm looking for one trait that's not hard look for
[50:48.740 --> 50:54.220]  20 traits that's hard that's real breeding but so what I was doing was
[50:54.220 --> 50:58.540]  increasing the sellability of cultivars that was sexy but not sexy enough now
[50:58.540 --> 51:03.180]  and I just use lab analysis and because I was fortunate that I was involved with
[51:03.180 --> 51:08.180]  so many labs and I was able to drive business to the labs once you make money
[51:08.300 --> 51:12.300]  for people people give you a little better break on the deal and so it
[51:12.300 --> 51:15.860]  allowed me to have an incredible price differential on what I was doing so I
[51:15.860 --> 51:20.540]  could play Frankenstein all the time and ask these questions but no one else I
[51:20.540 --> 51:25.380]  knew had the funds and I had the funds only because I was driving so much
[51:25.380 --> 51:30.180]  business to the lab that they just said we'll play with you but for most people
[51:30.180 --> 51:34.180]  they don't that's why for these you know younger breeders that were coming up I
[51:34.340 --> 51:38.260]  would give the material that I said hey look we know that this plant throws this
[51:38.260 --> 51:42.700]  turf profile it throws this morphological shape and it throws this
[51:42.700 --> 51:48.820]  chemotype on the majority of plants it touches and yes there's outliers but
[51:48.820 --> 51:52.580]  overall you'll get a population that's easier to sift because you'll have more
[51:52.580 --> 51:55.340]  of what you like and in the more of what you like you'll find the one that's
[51:55.340 --> 52:00.620]  exactly what you like it's the sifting process that's the it's the demon that's
[52:00.620 --> 52:04.780]  the one where you have to hold all the plants in redundant copy and then you
[52:04.780 --> 52:10.620]  have to be able to actually sit down and standardize your testing and be honest
[52:10.620 --> 52:14.260]  about it because the one thing I've noticed about breeding is that if the
[52:14.260 --> 52:18.860]  progeny isn't better than the parental stock you didn't do anything but because
[52:18.860 --> 52:22.020]  you made it it's your baby and the reality is is that you got a
[52:22.020 --> 52:28.340]  three-headed kid and you know and and as a breeder like he referred to earlier
[52:28.340 --> 52:33.220]  you have to be a you almost have to be a robot at this time state because you're
[52:33.220 --> 52:37.660]  creating things that you hold very dear to you because you've worked on them and
[52:37.660 --> 52:42.140]  now you're going to release them to people who are then going to do bad
[52:42.140 --> 52:46.220]  things to them and so that's tough you know so that's something you have to get
[52:46.220 --> 52:49.700]  over is you got to be able to release your stuff and be able to stand behind
[52:49.700 --> 52:54.100]  it and hope that they do well with it and that's kind of these two guys have
[52:54.100 --> 52:57.220]  been fighting over questions so what I'm gonna do is take him first and then
[52:57.220 --> 53:04.060]  Alan second okay this question is for Kevin and Anna. What is the biggest
[53:04.060 --> 53:09.180]  reoccurring mistake that your competitors make that limit their
[53:09.180 --> 53:17.020]  performance? I think that when it comes to doing genomics work it's an
[53:17.020 --> 53:22.260]  assumption that A and B combined will give you this and the reality is that
[53:22.460 --> 53:30.100]  often it doesn't it just doesn't match up and it's it's what I did is I took a
[53:30.100 --> 53:33.100]  look at all these other forms of breeding so I look at people who breed
[53:33.100 --> 53:38.460]  cattle people who breed dogs people who breed fish and I realized that there's
[53:38.460 --> 53:43.980]  an intangible genomically that is just is and what you have to work with is as
[53:43.980 --> 53:50.140]  much skill as possible and then some good fortune and good fortune is a big
[53:50.140 --> 53:55.420]  one because people always underestimate just the truth of that and and that's
[53:55.420 --> 53:59.740]  the that's what makes human beings so incredible because you can crush down a
[53:59.740 --> 54:03.340]  population all you want but out of the ghetto comes somebody who can split an
[54:03.340 --> 54:08.740]  atom because ultimately in that genetic code pops out something unbelievable
[54:08.740 --> 54:13.580]  from parents who were normal you can get exceptional somewhere in the line prior
[54:13.580 --> 54:17.260]  they had to be exceptional but it doesn't have to come out I use myself as
[54:17.260 --> 54:23.220]  an example of I'm a good breeder male because I don't really screw up the good
[54:23.220 --> 54:27.780]  woman that I chose to have kids with so the kids that come out are more like
[54:27.780 --> 54:32.580]  their mom than me all they have for me is they're more stubborn so that's what
[54:32.580 --> 54:36.100]  we notice is that my kids are stubborn and driven but other than that they're
[54:36.100 --> 54:39.960]  more like their mothers in appearance and in personality and so I'm a good
[54:39.960 --> 54:43.780]  breeder male because when you put me on top of it all I'm adding is some very
[54:43.780 --> 54:59.100]  specific traits you know what I want to say real fast too before we get the
[54:59.100 --> 55:03.860]  question but if you notice we've been having a sign language presentation you
[55:03.860 --> 55:07.100]  know what happened was a friend of mine can't eat a mushroom man he's hiding
[55:07.100 --> 55:10.340]  somewhere he hits me up and he says Kev I have some friends that are farmers in
[55:10.340 --> 55:14.860]  Oregon that are hearing impaired and he said you know this is something that
[55:14.860 --> 55:19.940]  needs to be brought into a conversation because did you know that this many
[55:19.940 --> 55:24.140]  people in the country or globally are hearing impaired and I didn't and I
[55:24.140 --> 55:30.260]  realized how ignorant I was to that situation and so he was like we need to
[55:30.260 --> 55:33.900]  do some work so that we can get cultivation information into the hands
[55:33.900 --> 55:38.020]  of the people that are hearing impaired because they have to build the
[55:38.020 --> 55:43.260]  vocabulary to explain what you're doing and I said hey we're doing this
[55:43.260 --> 55:47.380]  incredible regen event filled with really killer people breaking out
[55:47.380 --> 55:52.020]  incredible information maybe we can work it out and Josh was gracious enough to
[55:52.020 --> 55:56.180]  say hey I would love to have that and so what we have is we have people that are
[55:56.180 --> 56:01.820]  signing so that we can record it so that we can share it because fundamentally
[56:01.820 --> 56:07.700]  it's it's it's the world we're in really a cannabis is inclusive and so I just
[56:07.700 --> 56:21.440]  wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to come
[56:21.440 --> 56:26.240]  When you're ready just two or three minutes to explain the language barrier law
[56:26.240 --> 56:28.240]  Oh yeah, yeah, completely, completely
[56:28.240 --> 56:30.240]  I still understand it, I make it like
[56:30.240 --> 56:32.240]  Me too, me too
[56:32.240 --> 56:34.240]  So it's really, it really was wide opening to hear like
[56:34.240 --> 56:36.240]  There's these four interpreters in court to get this
[56:36.240 --> 56:38.240]  I would like them to explain it
[56:38.240 --> 56:44.040]  Yeah, no doubt, I just wanted to bring some attention because it's like what's going on and what it is is that you have this massive global population
[56:44.040 --> 56:53.880]  of people who cultivate cannabis, cannabis to me was always the most inclusive world and to be able to be tying more people into what we do is beautiful
[56:53.880 --> 56:58.400]  and the individuals were lovely individuals and they're cannabis farmers
[56:58.400 --> 57:03.040]  too so it allows them to be able to have an ability to understand the material
[57:03.040 --> 57:08.440]  and find a way to translate words that aren't translated yet and so that's
[57:08.440 --> 57:12.280]  what's going on and I'm just really happy to be part of it
[57:12.280 --> 57:14.280]  Thank you
[57:14.280 --> 57:16.280]  So, you have some questions
[57:16.280 --> 57:18.280]  Yeah, him
[57:18.280 --> 57:24.280]  Biggest reoccurring mistake your competitors make that limit their performance
[57:24.280 --> 57:26.280]  Oh, you know, that's kind of like
[57:26.280 --> 57:28.280]  Give us some juicy stuff
[57:28.280 --> 57:30.280]  You know, I think
[57:30.280 --> 57:38.280]  Personally, okay the question is what are my competitors, what's their biggest mistake that they're making right now
[57:38.280 --> 57:47.280]  and that's kind of a two part, that's two parts, for me personally I've made this mistake over the last two years and I'm just now getting a hold of it
[57:47.280 --> 57:53.280]  is not being aggressive in your marketing and your social media and getting your name out there
[57:53.280 --> 57:59.280]  I'm old school so it's been real tough for me to get out there and want to feel comfortable talking to people
[57:59.280 --> 58:06.280]  and I wasn't aggressive enough to get a website and get out there and really do a lot of events like this
[58:06.280 --> 58:12.280]  That's a big problem now because if you're not getting out there and they're not seeing you and they don't know who you are
[58:12.280 --> 58:20.280]  you are not going to make it because this is a new age of society where they want you to be
[58:20.280 --> 58:28.280]  It's a Kardashian thing, you know, you got to be able to show your friends, look I got this and I got it from him and that brings it in
[58:28.280 --> 58:36.280]  The other part is hyping up something too much and releasing it too soon without knowing what you've got
[58:36.280 --> 58:42.280]  and then it screws you later on down the road because all of a sudden you've got a hundred farmers that are pissed off
[58:42.280 --> 58:48.280]  because they spent six months of their time and all of a sudden they can't do anything with it because it didn't work out
[58:48.280 --> 58:56.280]  That and the same thing with the social media, you've got to be careful, don't over hype something and make sure that what you release is good
[58:56.280 --> 59:06.280]  Like I said, it's a two year program for me because once I make something, it's a whole year of doing depths, indoor, outdoor, full sun, shade
[59:06.280 --> 59:12.280]  How did it go across the board? Did the consumer like it? Did your vendors buy it?
[59:12.280 --> 59:18.280]  There's a lot to it and that's where people make the mistake of over hyping something that's not ready for the market
[59:18.280 --> 59:27.280]  With commoditized crops, crops that move globally, so that's corn, wheat, those take ten years
[59:27.280 --> 59:32.280]  It's three years of doing the breeding and then seven years of sifting the lines
[59:32.280 --> 59:37.280]  and so literally it's a ten year process to release something that's a commoditized component
[59:37.280 --> 59:43.280]  and with cannabis, ten years is a lifetime and so the thing is you want to get it to the market right now
[59:43.280 --> 59:49.280]  When people buy seed stock from any other industry, they're buying a very different type of seed
[59:49.280 --> 59:55.280]  and so they have expectations of reliability, repeatability and I think like what he was saying
[59:55.280 --> 59:59.280]  But see, he's honest, so he says listen, if he sent something out that was untested, he'd just say look, I haven't tested it
[59:59.280 --> 01:00:04.280]  I put together some interesting stuff, if you want to buy it, this is the cost and then you can run through and do your test
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:09.280]  but I wouldn't commit my whole crop to it and then they can find out if it works
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:14.280]  and you know, it's important but when we really take a look at what scientific breeding is
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:21.280]  and how we got to where we are with these major crops and stability, the amount of work required to get there is so huge
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:27.280]  that it lets you realize most of the stuff we're doing is just basically throwing darts with our eyes closed
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.280]  This gentleman right here before we forget him
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.280]  No, no, I'm sorry
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:36.280]  We all strive and want to create and do our own things and do new things
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.280]  and we all have a straight home that we're in love with and we want to plant it
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:45.280]  My issue is, yeah that's a great plan, but is corn a survival?
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.280]  What's your opinion on planting high-strain and throwing that out in these first couple of years
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:56.280]  to like retain traction with the market, have sales and continue to move on to the next thing?
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:02.280]  Do you recommend pushing hard on these hopeful amazing strains that we have at home
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:09.280]  or is it smart to just kind of understand and play with that hype market for survivability?
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.280]  See now I have something that's second-by cannabis, where if I bought it once I'd buy it twice
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.280]  and I can start to say, whoa, this has a quality that resonates
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:40.280]  and if I was to smoke it in 10 years, it'd still be good grass
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.280]  That's what you want to work with in your directions
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:47.280]  and sometimes I don't think that the farmer is really qualified
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:52.280]  and they hate to say this, but you've got to have somebody who can move pounds
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:58.280]  Somebody who knows how to traffic and they're going to be honestly telling you this isn't the right choice
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:04.280]  and what they tell you is the one you have over here that you're not looking at, that's the right choice
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:11.280]  and so if your abilities are broad where you have many skills, then you don't need to have the help
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:16.280]  but if they're not, then don't be so arrogant that you don't ask for some help
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:21.280]  and what it does, it lets you determine what is the trend and why
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.280]  It was like when I did the perp, when I went down and sat in the car and the bag got thrown in the window
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:31.280]  and I took a look at it under the street light and realized that the color was clearly defined under HDI
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:38.280]  in a quick turn and that the blunt didn't change flavor, I knew now why it had value
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:45.280]  and so I realized it was going to stay in vogue until that social change changed
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:51.280]  but then they took that and they modified it and the perp is the cherry pie, the cherry pie is the cookie
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:59.280]  it didn't go out of vogue, you just move the current to where it goes by adding little things that keep you trendy
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.280]  but if perp was a bunk, then it wouldn't still be current
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:08.280]  and that's what you have to take a look at and don't chase trends unless you're involved in Hollywood
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:14.280]  meaning that you have people that are setting the trends and they're able to let you see we got traction
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:20.280]  and then you smoke it and you go that's real, now you can run it because you need at least two years
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.280]  when I release varieties in clonal form, I want to see at least a two year lifespan
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.280]  where you can run it this year and get paid, next year you get paid
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:31.280]  and on the third year you can get paid but it's not red hot
[01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:34.280]  because everyone's going to pour into the market and fill it
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:40.280]  so two years, three years a dream, OG is like a legend where if you had the same cup for the last 15 years
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:44.280]  you would have got paid but now it has to be spiced up
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:52.280]  so like gelato for instance, I got a higher price point for that across the board all year long this year
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:04:00.280]  my biggest question is that one is going to last in the industry, I personally think yes
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:08.280]  I agree, it's just that what's going to happen is it's going to change into which gelato, which subtlety
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.280]  it's kind of like looking at wedding cake and birthday cake
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.280]  so wedding cake yields better and it gives you better color
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.280]  but if you consume it next to birthday cake it's not as satisfactory
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:23.280]  and so the thing is you have to be able to say okay why do they like it
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.280]  I got the gelato 41 right, so the 41 has this incredible cherry pie on top of that
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:31.280]  that flavor profile that lasts in the joint, it's gorgeous
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:36.280]  but the thing is if you go only that route what we noticed is fuserian prone
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:41.280]  and so all of a sudden now your whole library is prone to pathogenic pressure
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:46.280]  so maybe 15% of your line becomes gelato or gelato hybrids
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:51.280]  and you've used them for years and had success and people know when they come to you that they can get those things
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.280]  but you start weighing everything heavy that one way
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.280]  oh you got a problem if it goes south
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.280]  welcome
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:06.280]  when you pollinate is it more open pollination or do you get a brush
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.280]  that depends on the project that I'm working on
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:13.280]  depends on whether we're doing open pollination or I'm doing something specific
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:19.280]  that's generalized and if I'm doing open pollination I'm usually using at least 3 males
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.280]  depending on how many females I'm using
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:26.280]  well he's saying open pollination meaning when you're laying pollen onto the plant
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.280]  are you allowing the male and the female to naturally pollinate themselves or are you directing the pollen
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.280]  ok I think I misunderstood
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:37.280]  for me I like to collect the pollen and then I use it as needed with a brush
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:42.280]  or I'm taking it out there and I'll have a paper bag, put my butt in it, make sure you shake it
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:49.280]  now I also do direct open pollination in the greenhouses where the males are in there with the females
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:55.280]  the fans are blowing and they'll be in there for a couple days to make sure I'm getting a full complete thing
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:06:01.280]  but if I'm doing specific breeding in the garden and I don't want to contaminate everything
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.280]  yeah take it in a jar, take a brush brush, go out there
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:08.280]  you can actually now get sleeves that you can put around your plant
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:12.280]  that's a mesh, you can inject your pollen right into the little thing
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:16.280]  it drops it right in there, you seal it off and it's not going to affect the rest of your plants
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.280]  so yeah it depends on what program you're doing
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.280]  what do you do with the flower?
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:31.280]  I'll be using the mid branches, normally the whole plant because I'm breeding for everything
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:37.280]  two years ago when I was with the Mendo hideout we were just doing branch specifics on lower branches
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:41.280]  because we were trying to maintain the rest of the flower for production
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:44.280]  how deep into the cycle do you go?
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:49.280]  this is going to depend on your varietals because all of them have a different flowering period
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:54.280]  so if they produce an abundance of pollen receptor sites early that's when you need to hit them
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:59.280]  but if you don't see that happening, so say between 21 to 25 is like a little sweet spot
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.280]  but if you're going to go into something that might finish at 90 days
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:06.280]  then lo and behold there's no sites at 28 days
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.280]  it's still in a transitional vegetative stage
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.280]  so you have to basically choose your pollination times for the varietals that you're using
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.280]  and that's trial and error and that's your R&D
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:19.280]  and then what you do is you record it and so that you know
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:26.280]  hey when I pollinated at this time this way I only received this much seed mass per square foot
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:32.280]  and it gives you a really clear idea of what's the efficiency of your pollination
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.280]  and that matters and people like only want a couple
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.280]  but the thing about it is if you copy how they do it commercially
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:41.280]  then it'll let you use someone else's brain
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.280]  it's better not to learn through mistake
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.280]  it's better to let someone else fuck up and you learn through their mistake
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.280]  it's painful
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:53.280]  and just admit it though, don't be afraid to admit it
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.280]  don't steal the credit
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:59.280]  that's my whole thing with breeders is that they always get screwed
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.280]  because most of them are so passionate about the work
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:07.280]  that they don't chase the protection
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:11.280]  the best example I have of brand protection is Michael Buffa
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.280]  and Michael Buffa come up with one phrase
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.280]  let's get ready to rumble
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.280]  do you know how much that phrase is worth?
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.280]  half a billion dollars
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.280]  and you know why it's worth half a billion?
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:25.280]  because he sends a team of lawyers to beat you to death
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.280]  if he finds out you're using it
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.280]  and what it does it lets him proprietary own that phrase
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:33.280]  breeders rely on people like us
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:36.280]  farmers, growers, nursery operators, store operators
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:41.280]  to be conscientious of the fact that they put all the work in
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:45.280]  and so instead of me taking his work and then relabeling it myself
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:48.280]  I make sure I give credit to him
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.280]  and push it
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:53.280]  and then what it does it lets him do the work he's supposed to
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:56.280]  so I'm riding on his coattails but I'm not stealing his coat
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.280]  thank you
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.280]  I try man, I try
[01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:08.490]  this one guy's been trying to get a question forever
[01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:10.490]  okay, one more question
[01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:15.490]  can you talk about really special techniques for extremely stubborn seeds?
[01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:17.490]  cracking or pollinating?
[01:09:17.490 --> 01:09:19.490]  cracking
[01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:21.490]  so at a general level
[01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.490]  because I'm just a regular farmer
[01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:25.490]  I like coconut water or hydrogen peroxide
[01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:27.490]  and I'll soak them
[01:09:27.490 --> 01:09:31.490]  Kevin has a whole way more intense
[01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:34.490]  laboratory procedure he can explain to you
[01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:37.490]  but for me I'll either soak them in coconut water
[01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:39.490]  and then they go in the ground
[01:09:39.490 --> 01:09:41.490]  I use regular real coconut water
[01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:44.490]  because that coconut is that life juice that's in that coconut
[01:09:44.490 --> 01:09:47.490]  is seed, that's to get that seed going
[01:09:47.490 --> 01:09:48.490]  it works amazing
[01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:50.490]  I'll soak them in coconut water
[01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:52.490]  then they'll go into either paper towels and wait
[01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:54.490]  so I can check my germination rates
[01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.490]  or they'll go straight into the soil blocks
[01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:59.490]  there's hydrogen peroxide
[01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:02.490]  you can use the regular store bought hydrogen peroxide
[01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:06.490]  but it's not quite as great as the concentrated
[01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:08.490]  quick little roll around in them
[01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:10.490]  and then back in
[01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:13.490]  and then they'll go into purified water packs
[01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:16.490]  with paper towels or into our soil blocks
[01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:20.490]  but Kevin has a whole intense way of being able to do it
[01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:22.490]  a lot of it is
[01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:26.490]  does the seed have the ability to break through the husk?
[01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:29.490]  and so you can mechanically crack it
[01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:32.490]  and you can also sometimes scarify it
[01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:33.490]  to make it so that it can be
[01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:35.490]  the liquid can imbibe easier
[01:10:35.490 --> 01:10:37.490]  because sometimes you get a skin on the seed
[01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:38.490]  that's very resistant
[01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:41.490]  and so what I do is I make these containers
[01:10:41.490 --> 01:10:43.490]  where I glue sandpaper inside the container
[01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:46.490]  and then I can just shake the seed and scarify it
[01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:48.490]  and then once I've scarified it
[01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:51.490]  now I have the ability to get liquid to penetrate easier
[01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:53.490]  and then I'd want to
[01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:55.490]  it depends on just how old this is
[01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:57.490]  but if I can use an H2O2 solution
[01:10:57.490 --> 01:10:59.490]  what it does it allows me to be able to get
[01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:01.490]  a form of oxygen driven into it
[01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:03.490]  so that I start to have this
[01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:05.490]  metabolic process move forward
[01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:08.490]  and I can also use stuff like
[01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:10.490]  agrokashi in a liquid form
[01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:12.490]  because what I'm doing is I'm getting
[01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:13.490]  what I call bioprotectants
[01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:16.490]  I use that on TC plants too
[01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:18.490]  where if I can give the plant
[01:11:18.490 --> 01:11:20.490]  a bioprotective form
[01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:22.490]  it allows this to imbibe
[01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:24.490]  and it allows it to instantly have
[01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:28.490]  the bioprotectants needed to survive as a child
[01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:31.490]  because a lot of the stock that's tough to crack
[01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:35.490]  is typically a little weaker in general
[01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:37.490]  and so I want to give it everything possible
[01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:39.490]  so I don't need to go through 300 seeds
[01:11:39.490 --> 01:11:40.490]  to get 50 out
[01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:43.490]  and what you're going to find is some plants just do that
[01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:45.490]  those aren't the ones you work with in that form
[01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:47.490]  it's like the clone ability
[01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:49.490]  when I'm looking for cultivars
[01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:51.490]  that I want to work on a nursery level
[01:11:51.490 --> 01:11:53.490]  if it doesn't clone I can't use it
[01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:56.490]  so I've had plants that you couldn't strike roots for 30 days
[01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:59.490]  that makes it impossible to put into a clonal operation
[01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:01.490]  and that's what made me understand
[01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:03.490]  how many killer varieties we've lost
[01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:05.490]  because they're so hard to propagate
[01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:07.490]  it's just a reality
[01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:11.490]  and so I think that was the last question
[01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:13.490]  right?
[01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:15.490]  Thank you
[01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:19.490]  and thank you Eric from HBK man
[01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:21.490]  always a privilege
[01:12:21.490 --> 01:12:23.490]  Thank you
