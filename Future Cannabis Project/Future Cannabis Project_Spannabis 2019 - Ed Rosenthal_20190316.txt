[00:00.000 --> 00:06.560]  Hey guys, Lance Lambert here coming to you from Barcelona, Spain for Spanivis 2019.
[00:06.560 --> 00:11.000]  All of a sudden it's getting really smoky around here and it could be because I think
[00:11.000 --> 00:18.440]  it's literally almost 420, but also because we've got the one, the only, the man, the
[00:18.440 --> 00:21.960]  myth, the legend, we've got Ed Rosenthal here with us.
[00:21.960 --> 00:23.960]  How are you doing, Ed?
[00:23.960 --> 00:25.360]  I'm doing fine.
[00:25.360 --> 00:26.360]  Nice.
[00:26.360 --> 00:30.560]  I mean, a good friend and a fellow in the industry.
[00:30.560 --> 00:33.680]  I want to get Ed on camera and just get his take on Spain.
[00:33.680 --> 00:36.640]  So tell me, this isn't your first rodeo.
[00:36.640 --> 00:37.640]  You've been here before.
[00:37.640 --> 00:38.640]  Yes.
[00:38.640 --> 00:39.640]  Yeah.
[00:39.640 --> 00:40.640]  What have you seen?
[00:40.640 --> 00:41.640]  I think we've talked.
[00:41.640 --> 00:42.640]  You like Barcelona.
[00:42.640 --> 00:44.240]  I think it's a nice city and all.
[00:44.240 --> 00:47.720]  How much have you seen this place change in the last several years?
[00:47.720 --> 00:53.560]  Well, it's grown tremendously and it's much more sophisticated than it was just a few
[00:53.560 --> 00:54.560]  years ago.
[00:54.560 --> 00:55.560]  Yeah.
[00:55.760 --> 01:07.360]  And it's very similar to being to some American shows that are grower oriented.
[01:07.360 --> 01:08.360]  And what do you think?
[01:08.360 --> 01:14.240]  I mean, this is, you mentioned like US shows, even Canadian shows, but US shows more so
[01:14.240 --> 01:19.080]  where it's either business to business or consumer, but here, especially in Europe,
[01:19.080 --> 01:21.360]  it seems they overlap the two, right?
[01:21.360 --> 01:25.360]  I mean, it's just a common thing that you see.
[01:26.160 --> 01:32.160]  Well, I think that the American industry is more segmented right now.
[01:32.160 --> 01:33.160]  Yeah.
[01:33.160 --> 01:48.160]  And, uh, but I think that there is, that in America right now, the grower has been left
[01:48.160 --> 01:51.160]  behind sort of at the shows.
[01:51.160 --> 01:54.160]  And I think that that will change.
[01:54.160 --> 01:55.160]  Yeah.
[01:55.960 --> 01:57.960]  And I think that there is a growing demand for cannabis.
[01:57.960 --> 01:58.960]  Very true.
[01:58.960 --> 01:59.960]  Very true.
[01:59.960 --> 02:00.960]  So what is your take?
[02:00.960 --> 02:03.960]  You know how things are here more than anyone.
[02:03.960 --> 02:10.960]  Social clubs versus coffee shops in the Netherlands versus us only having dispensaries in the
[02:10.960 --> 02:12.960]  US and Canada.
[02:12.960 --> 02:14.960]  What's your take on the social club?
[02:14.960 --> 02:18.960]  Do you think that's a good model for mainstream per se?
[02:19.760 --> 02:25.760]  I think that coffee, that social clubs or coffee shops are both good models.
[02:25.760 --> 02:28.760]  And we have that in California.
[02:28.760 --> 02:29.760]  Yeah.
[02:29.760 --> 02:32.760]  We have lounges where people can use it.
[02:32.760 --> 02:33.760]  Nice.
[02:33.760 --> 02:34.760]  Yeah.
[02:34.760 --> 02:35.760]  So that's happening.
[02:35.760 --> 02:36.760]  Yeah, right.
[02:36.760 --> 02:40.760]  Because I mean, that's the thing I think about, and it's domestic and international, how many
[02:40.760 --> 02:47.760]  pubs and clubs that you pass where alcohol is obviously the open option for consumption.
[02:48.560 --> 02:52.560]  But for those that rather consume cannabis, not alcohol, it's just tough, right?
[02:52.560 --> 02:57.560]  I mean, it's just so many places where there isn't a communal opportunity or social opportunity.
[02:57.560 --> 03:08.560]  It's really difficult to have a pub type scene, or it has been, before the cannabis clubs
[03:08.560 --> 03:09.560]  started opening.
[03:09.560 --> 03:10.560]  Yeah.
[03:11.360 --> 03:20.360]  And I think that that's really a healthy phenomenon.
[03:20.360 --> 03:27.360]  And the reason why I use the term healthy is because I don't think that drinking a lot
[03:27.360 --> 03:34.360]  or social drinking, which often leads to overindulgence, is really good for people.
[03:34.360 --> 03:35.360]  Yeah.
[03:35.360 --> 03:38.360]  I'm not saying it should be outlawed or corrupt or anything.
[03:39.160 --> 03:41.160]  But people should at least be given a choice.
[03:41.160 --> 03:43.160]  And that's what's happening.
[03:43.160 --> 03:45.160]  Yeah, I agree with that too.
[03:45.160 --> 03:46.160]  So what else?
[03:46.160 --> 03:51.160]  What do you think is the future of cannabis on a global scale?
[03:51.160 --> 03:55.160]  I think a good question to ask being that we're in kind of the epicenter of Europe right now, right?
[03:55.160 --> 04:00.160]  Well, I think that it's happening all over.
[04:00.960 --> 04:10.960]  And both in South America, Central America, Canada, and then over here in Europe.
[04:10.960 --> 04:14.960]  And, you know, each country has its own laws.
[04:14.960 --> 04:15.960]  Yeah.
[04:15.960 --> 04:23.960]  And then also in Malaysia, they just came out and said they were going to execute a
[04:24.760 --> 04:31.760]  person who was giving kids THC and CBD for epilepsy.
[04:31.760 --> 04:35.760]  And there was such protest that they're changing the laws there.
[04:35.760 --> 04:36.760]  Wow.
[04:36.760 --> 04:39.760]  And that's something you'd not expect in Malaysia because they're up there with Singapore on
[04:39.760 --> 04:41.760]  capital punishment and crime.
[04:41.760 --> 04:42.760]  Right.
[04:42.760 --> 04:47.760]  But they decided, wait, maybe he doesn't have victims.
[04:47.760 --> 04:49.760]  Well, that's a good segue.
[04:50.560 --> 04:54.560]  You know, something that happened is, I'd say a gift over the holidays we weren't expecting,
[04:54.560 --> 04:59.560]  but for Thailand and South Korea to announce that they're going to move forward to medical.
[04:59.560 --> 05:02.560]  I mean, is that something that you imagined in your lifetime?
[05:02.560 --> 05:06.560]  I don't even know if I imagined Asia coming around to cannabis, even though that's a better
[05:06.560 --> 05:09.560]  part of where this all began, I guess you can say.
[05:09.560 --> 05:11.560]  But what's your take on that?
[05:11.560 --> 05:16.560]  Well, certainly the ruling classes didn't appreciate it.
[05:17.360 --> 05:23.360]  But I think that this medical thing has gotten its grips on people because marijuana is a
[05:23.360 --> 05:25.360]  medicine and it can help people.
[05:25.360 --> 05:28.360]  And who would want to keep people from their medicine?
[05:28.360 --> 05:29.360]  Yeah.
[05:29.360 --> 05:30.360]  Makes sense.
[05:30.360 --> 05:31.360]  Perfect.
[05:31.360 --> 05:36.360]  Well, I, as always, appreciated Ed as a friend and a colleague in the industry.
[05:36.360 --> 05:39.360]  You know, you really are, in my eyes, you are a true legend.
[05:39.360 --> 05:41.360]  You bring so much.
[05:41.360 --> 05:42.360]  You have so much history.
[05:43.160 --> 05:47.160]  And it's so utterly important for that to be continued and carried through into the future.
[05:47.160 --> 05:48.160]  So I thank you for your time.
[05:48.160 --> 05:49.160]  Definitely appreciate it.
[05:49.160 --> 05:51.160]  Enjoy your stay at Spanavis.
[05:52.160 --> 05:53.160]  My pleasure.
