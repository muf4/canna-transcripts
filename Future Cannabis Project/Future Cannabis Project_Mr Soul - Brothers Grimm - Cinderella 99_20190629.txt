[00:04.670 --> 00:10.630]  I'm Mr. Soule, creator of Cinderella 99 and the founder of Brothers Grim Seeds.
[00:10.630 --> 00:15.670]  Rick, we were talking about basically the Rosetta Stone and how you at first
[00:15.670 --> 00:19.510]  achieved getting it and kind of would you like to talk more about that story?
[00:19.510 --> 00:24.530]  Yeah I think it's a good one because when people see that it's popular now
[00:24.530 --> 00:31.750]  it's been in the news and highly rated like that you want to know well more
[00:31.750 --> 00:36.270]  about it right and another interesting wrinkle to the whole story was back
[00:36.270 --> 00:41.390]  when Brothers Grim first started in the late 90s around 2000 I think it was I
[00:41.390 --> 00:45.610]  released a Rosetta Stone but it was a different formula but I love the name so
[00:45.610 --> 00:50.470]  much and I found the new combination that I put together this time to be
[00:50.470 --> 00:54.550]  something that I thought would eclipse the old version and people would just
[00:54.550 --> 00:57.870]  forget about that one and say or maybe never have heard of it you know because
[00:57.870 --> 00:59.230]  it's been such a long time.
[00:59.230 --> 01:01.470]  Well the old version did make it into the Big Book of Buds
[01:01.470 --> 01:05.070]  and for a lot of connoisseurs in the early ages that was our biblical
[01:05.070 --> 01:09.790]  standpoint for genetics I mean it's it definitely turned some heads.
[01:09.790 --> 01:13.790]  Well that was one of the sisters that came from the bud of Jack Harer from
[01:13.790 --> 01:19.550]  Amsterdam where Princess and Genius came from and there was a third female that I
[01:19.550 --> 01:26.710]  called Cafe Girl and she had a ginger ale flavor and so that Rosetta Stone
[01:26.710 --> 01:31.990]  original combination had that type of a profile and people liked it apparently
[01:31.990 --> 01:37.150]  more than I ever realized and so when I created the new version of Rosetta Stone
[01:37.150 --> 01:45.270]  I liked this I reputedly have the Jack Harer's original cut that was
[01:45.270 --> 01:50.670]  presented to him of the Jack Harer strain from Scentsy Seed Bank and Ben
[01:50.670 --> 01:56.270]  Dronkers supposedly gave this cut to to Jack Harer himself and so I love that
[01:56.270 --> 02:01.790]  female and crossed it to my best Cinderella 99 reversed and so we have a
[02:01.790 --> 02:07.310]  feminized Rosetta Stone now. We also do it in the regular but that's
[02:07.310 --> 02:13.190]  how that came about and it's a amazing improvement upon the parents you know I
[02:13.190 --> 02:18.430]  really like to think that whenever I put a seed line out if something that isn't
[02:18.430 --> 02:22.750]  just the same as one of the parents it has to be an improvement has to have
[02:22.910 --> 02:28.790]  some reason for being and so in the case of Rosetta Stone I have if you could
[02:28.790 --> 02:36.110]  kind of put it in a nutshell to say it's Jack Harer flavor and high but in a much
[02:36.110 --> 02:42.350]  bigger yielding faster flowering more stable if you will in other words more
[02:42.350 --> 02:46.230]  uniform plants come out of every pack of seeds than you would ever expect from a
[02:46.230 --> 02:51.830]  real the old-school Jack Harer. So that's what I've been doing lately
[02:51.830 --> 02:58.070]  and well I did recently grow the Cindy 99 and I was very impressed. People are
[02:58.070 --> 03:01.710]  still coming back to me all the time of course and I never will tire of hearing
[03:01.710 --> 03:05.430]  the stories old and new of people who say you know I'd always heard about
[03:05.430 --> 03:11.190]  Cinderella 99 now it's available again is a you know is it the same and how did
[03:11.190 --> 03:14.590]  you do it and you know I have to answer all those kinds of questions and explain
[03:14.590 --> 03:19.510]  to people and you and I have talked about how by still having the original
[03:19.510 --> 03:23.870]  clone of princess that that's the mother that creates the seeds and we
[03:23.870 --> 03:27.870]  were talking earlier about when you create a seed line that really works you
[03:27.870 --> 03:32.790]  should maintain that same mother and father and use them over and over as like
[03:32.790 --> 03:37.910]  a formula to create that seed or a recipe that a chef would use or
[03:37.910 --> 03:40.590]  something and some people get a little confused with breeding and they think
[03:40.590 --> 03:44.150]  that well those seeds were great you know and I want more of them and maybe I
[03:44.150 --> 03:48.150]  should cross a brother or sister from those seeds but that's not the same
[03:48.150 --> 03:52.110]  thing as going back and breeding those seeds from the original parents so what
[03:52.110 --> 03:59.270]  I did to recreate Cinderella 99 is having that original female not having
[03:59.270 --> 04:03.950]  the original male but having the seed pack that the original male came from
[04:03.950 --> 04:08.670]  and then regrowing them and finding a new male that would be a brother of the
[04:08.670 --> 04:13.190]  original one it's not a very big difference and in the end I feel that
[04:13.190 --> 04:16.750]  the Cinderella 99 today just stands up every bit as good as the old one did
[04:16.750 --> 04:22.510]  because they're virtually identical you know so I love to get that feedback from
[04:22.510 --> 04:26.990]  people that they will say wow I didn't think that after all this time it would
[04:26.990 --> 04:30.790]  be possible to recreate a seed line and you know done right yeah it's very
[04:30.790 --> 04:34.510]  possible so we've seen that around the industry too especially with a lot of
[04:34.510 --> 04:39.950]  reputable breeders with their older genetics not producing the same
[04:39.950 --> 04:45.510]  quality for different phenos they're actually coming out to 30 40 all kinds
[04:45.510 --> 04:49.190]  of different numbers that have just destabilized not necessarily their brand
[04:49.190 --> 04:53.310]  but definitely that genome the uniformity of the plants you're getting
[04:53.310 --> 04:58.670]  out of a pack of seeds is influenced a lot by the variability on both parents
[04:58.670 --> 05:04.550]  sides you know and then it just makes more of a lottery ticket you know out of
[05:04.550 --> 05:08.590]  each seed that you're getting because all those genetic possibilities coming
[05:08.750 --> 05:16.310]  together creates variability but by having parents that are the same as well
[05:16.310 --> 05:20.870]  as not having a lot of variability in their own gene backgrounds you know
[05:20.870 --> 05:25.470]  you're going to really ensure that you're gonna get the same thing every
[05:25.470 --> 05:29.750]  time reliably right which might not be that important to some people because
[05:29.750 --> 05:32.710]  there are a lot of people who believe like I like to buy you know a bunch of
[05:32.710 --> 05:37.790]  seeds and have a pheno hunt and look for something special out of that group well
[05:37.790 --> 05:41.710]  nothing wrong with that if that's your goal but many people are really serious
[05:41.710 --> 05:45.110]  minded professionals coming into this and saying well I want to grow a crop
[05:45.110 --> 05:48.590]  and I don't want to have to try and you know do a lot of guesswork or testing
[05:48.590 --> 05:53.510]  before I find the plant that I'm going to reproduce and clone and make for
[05:53.510 --> 05:58.750]  production so they would like to be able to say isn't there a reputable place
[05:58.750 --> 06:03.230]  where I could buy packs of seeds where they're going to perform as advertised
[06:03.230 --> 06:07.390]  on the description on the pack you know and I can count on you know nearly all
[06:07.390 --> 06:11.590]  the females being the exact same thing and that's what I try to do you know
[06:11.590 --> 06:15.110]  that's what I have on the market and that's why my menu consists of maybe
[06:15.110 --> 06:20.750]  what eight strains is 12 if you count the feminized versions of the regulars
[06:20.750 --> 06:25.670]  or something like that because I feel keeping control over a smaller menu of
[06:25.670 --> 06:31.510]  strains is a lot smarter than trying to keep up with fads and whatever's popular
[06:31.510 --> 06:37.750]  now and chasing that sort of thing I have heard of a they call it the hedgehog
[06:37.750 --> 06:43.430]  effect right or the hedgehog principle that a hedgehog has only like one defense
[06:43.430 --> 06:47.310]  but it's a perfect defense and so when you have that one thing that you do
[06:47.310 --> 06:52.070]  really well concentrate on that specialize in that so well I like the
[06:52.070 --> 06:56.030]  way that you do that because ultimately with that kind of destabilization we see
[06:56.030 --> 06:59.670]  a lot of limited hitting the market and really that's almost a lazy man's breed
[06:59.830 --> 07:04.910]  in a sense you'll get great things out of it and it's not always that way but
[07:04.910 --> 07:09.150]  if that's your business then ultimately if you're a one-and-done there's no real
[07:09.150 --> 07:13.510]  art to that the real artistry in breederships comes to the long-term
[07:13.510 --> 07:17.790]  stabilization and the recreation of your genetic to make it a timeless genetic
[07:17.790 --> 07:21.790]  and that's what we see with you that I've really enjoyed when we've cracked
[07:21.790 --> 07:28.270]  the Cindy 99's I saw three different phenos out of 20 seeds and that's what
[07:28.270 --> 07:35.030]  you expect out of a regular seed pack back in 1995 1998 I mean these are
[07:35.030 --> 07:38.510]  things we don't see in today's market and the other thing that's important
[07:38.510 --> 07:43.870]  about when you do have slight variations in the Cinderella 99's that it's really
[07:43.870 --> 07:48.630]  not anything that's a major trait it's usually like oh some color like this one
[07:48.630 --> 07:52.670]  got a little more purple and this one didn't you know big deal can you tell
[07:52.670 --> 07:56.870]  the difference when you smoke it no you know so I'm pragmatic I guess and I
[07:56.870 --> 08:01.830]  would say like that the things that are most important the potency the resin
[08:01.830 --> 08:06.950]  production you know the flavor the yield all those things should be a really
[08:06.950 --> 08:10.510]  tight grouping right but then if there's like okay this one had a little more
[08:10.510 --> 08:16.270]  color of this or color who cares I had a guy write me this is a funny story I had
[08:16.270 --> 08:20.670]  an email from a guy who said I really question whether these Cinderella 99
[08:20.670 --> 08:26.710]  seeds that I got from this distributor are real because he's still in veg mind
[08:26.710 --> 08:29.430]  you you know he hasn't even flowered the plants and already he's convinced
[08:29.430 --> 08:35.190]  this can't be real Cinderella 99 why because the leaf serrations on the edges
[08:35.190 --> 08:39.230]  of the leaves didn't look the way he remembered them from the last time which
[08:39.230 --> 08:43.470]  was like over 10 years ago or something like you know a your memory is probably
[08:43.470 --> 08:48.790]  faulty and even if you had a photograph of it nobody breeds for leaf serration
[08:48.790 --> 08:53.030]  uniformity I mean that might vary all over the place it might hold genetic
[08:53.190 --> 08:56.630]  traits but it's not necessarily your goal in breeding for that trait it
[08:56.630 --> 09:01.430]  doesn't prove you know that it's one thing or another right when the breeder
[09:01.430 --> 09:08.870]  has concentrated on creating finished flowers and of a certain quality this is
[09:08.870 --> 09:14.670]  Canna con so the that was actually pretty cool to have him pop in like that
[09:14.670 --> 09:21.630]  and drop a little reality on a reality TV effect on the whole interview but
[09:21.630 --> 09:27.190]  yeah what was I saying you're that just maybe we were we were basically talking
[09:27.190 --> 09:30.950]  about the phenotype ping and how important it is that there's not much
[09:30.950 --> 09:35.490]  variance because when I did say that I had the three different phenos I had 18
[09:35.490 --> 09:40.230]  females now mind you when what slight differences were those three phenos it's
[09:40.230 --> 09:44.670]  like one was a little more chunky and one was a little more triangular with
[09:44.670 --> 09:48.070]  the bud formation and to be honest they could have sat in the same bag they had
[09:48.070 --> 09:52.510]  a very similar odor and they were very very subtle and I mean like single
[09:52.510 --> 09:55.950]  percentage changes on the readout this is what I'm trying to say that was what
[09:55.950 --> 09:59.470]  my point was earlier when I lost track of what I was talking about but the
[09:59.470 --> 10:04.310]  really important characteristics stay true throughout all the females you get
[10:04.310 --> 10:08.870]  from a pack of seeds and that's that's what I take pride in and I try to do in
[10:08.870 --> 10:11.870]  all of my strains is give people something that where you buy the pack of
[10:11.870 --> 10:17.070]  seeds it's a uniform result that it's as advertised on the description on the
[10:17.070 --> 10:22.990]  pack you know and there's and there's a there's a place for that
[10:25.790 --> 10:31.110]  what it is is really translating the old ways to the new days and that's really a
[10:31.110 --> 10:34.830]  big important thing that we don't have going forward we've got a lot of people
[10:34.830 --> 10:38.990]  getting into this game without we'll call it an under education of what
[10:38.990 --> 10:42.870]  they're truly dealing with they don't even have an association to plants as
[10:42.870 --> 10:47.830]  people some of these these folks and that is really the biggest kind of
[10:47.830 --> 10:52.550]  connection to genetics that I found when I can sit here and say these two parents
[10:52.550 --> 10:56.870]  have kids well yes these kids all look alike but if the mother goes and has a
[10:56.870 --> 11:00.270]  child with somebody else that kid may look completely different and that goes
[11:00.270 --> 11:04.070]  back to what Rick was saying about making sure that the crossbreeding goes
[11:04.070 --> 11:08.070]  back to the original parents because with that the consistency of the genetic
[11:08.390 --> 11:13.270]  can stay more true over time and to be totally direct it's one of the only real
[11:13.270 --> 11:19.150]  safe lines in this industry that is of a more naturalized methodology to get that
[11:19.150 --> 11:23.430]  consistency and to be totally direct the more natural we can remain in this the
[11:23.430 --> 11:27.710]  more healthy it remains as well so I have a great respect for the way that
[11:27.710 --> 11:31.030]  Rick does his genetics and it's one of the reasons I'm a longtime runner up I
[11:31.030 --> 11:38.630]  appreciate that
[11:38.630 --> 11:44.110]  I'm really looking for terpenes and so a lot of my terpene inductions have been
[11:44.110 --> 11:47.350]  kind of moving into the higher THC strains one of the things that you'll
[11:47.350 --> 11:51.550]  see in a lot of the 30% plus strains is yes they're 30 plus they'll knock you on
[11:51.550 --> 11:56.630]  the floor whatever but they're going to have a very waxy overtone in most of
[11:56.630 --> 12:00.990]  these strains and it's very rare to get one over 30 with strong terps and so
[12:00.990 --> 12:04.750]  that's kind of something that we've been working on breeding in and it's been a
[12:04.750 --> 12:09.070]  project of mine and to be honest I'm not sure the limitations yet so it's
[12:09.070 --> 12:14.190]  it's been an exciting adventure that's a you know very ambitious and bold thing
[12:14.190 --> 12:20.270]  to be diving into so kudos to you to even trying that and I think that just
[12:20.270 --> 12:25.070]  touching back on I don't want to make this all about you know mr. soul and his
[12:25.070 --> 12:30.070]  strains are you know the best thing or anything like that because in fact what's
[12:30.070 --> 12:35.550]  happening currently with this wave of lots of variety and different hybrids
[12:35.550 --> 12:40.870]  and so on is that it exposes all the possibilities there are in cannabis and
[12:40.870 --> 12:45.430]  maybe the person who created the strain if he's humble and honest with himself
[12:45.430 --> 12:49.990]  says you know hey I'm a great breeder but I lucked into something you know I
[12:49.990 --> 12:53.430]  lucked into something at the beginning but I almost feel like I need to learn
[12:53.430 --> 12:57.990]  more and work harder over the next few years and so on but the benefit to the
[12:57.990 --> 13:01.830]  public that's out there that's now coming into this and saying well hey I
[13:01.830 --> 13:07.750]  have a choice I can go with like the gentleman said earlier agricultural
[13:07.750 --> 13:12.910]  standardized kind of mentality for buying seeds where you get what is
[13:12.910 --> 13:17.270]  advertised and expect to get you know uniformity and the seeds that you grow
[13:17.270 --> 13:23.150]  and so on and then there's this other opportunity or a possibility that's out
[13:23.150 --> 13:27.470]  there for people to say hey I could also go for the grab bag you know like hey who
[13:27.550 --> 13:32.470]  knows what I'm gonna get and it might be wonderful and I see a lot of strange
[13:32.470 --> 13:37.270]  stuff come up and very little really makes me say sit back and take notice
[13:37.270 --> 13:41.150]  and say all right that's something I'd really want to know more about but
[13:41.150 --> 13:45.470]  people know in the past year or so I've gotten interested in the Mac from
[13:45.470 --> 13:50.750]  Capulator and I really think that that's in all of my 30 some years or whatever
[13:50.750 --> 13:56.270]  in this business it stands out in a way that I sit up and take notice and
[13:56.270 --> 14:05.720]  there's not many that do that so it really oh yeah I can yeah why good
[14:05.720 --> 14:10.600]  question that's the great follow-up the the terpenes the aromas from it are
[14:10.600 --> 14:18.920]  really unique and different and very to me desirable there are strains like
[14:18.920 --> 14:22.920]  Gorilla Glue that you know you'll never forget Gorilla Glue after you smell it
[14:22.920 --> 14:29.480]  once and it's a really amazing heavy hitting I call it a heavy strain it
[14:29.480 --> 14:34.400]  makes me sleepy it knocks me out it's like a couch lock kind of smoke so Josie
[14:34.400 --> 14:39.120]  Wales and the the group from Gigi they call themselves Gigi strains now right
[14:39.120 --> 14:44.960]  that's a heavy strain but the aroma to me is so gassy and heavy that I wouldn't
[14:44.960 --> 14:49.520]  want to have that all the time you know and and that's the thing with the terpene
[14:49.520 --> 14:52.880]  strains is there a double-edged sword because they will mark you for life but
[14:52.880 --> 14:57.240]  you can't sell them every day or can ingest them every day I find it a little
[14:57.240 --> 15:02.040]  yeah almost heavy-handed a little over overpowering but that Mac maybe I'm a
[15:02.040 --> 15:07.480]  sucker for like subtleties and lots of the notes in my nose like wow what is
[15:07.480 --> 15:11.200]  that I can't quite put my finger on it and that's how this Mac strain strikes
[15:11.200 --> 15:16.720]  me in terms of my nose it's all about like wow what is that I'd feel like I
[15:16.760 --> 15:20.800]  sense something familiar but I can't quite put my finger on it I've called it
[15:20.800 --> 15:24.760]  like play-doh like when you were a kid you open up a new jar of play-doh it's
[15:24.760 --> 15:30.000]  got that strange salty kind of bicarbonate smell yeah but also with like
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.640]  a floral fruity thing going through it and I mean it's just so sweet I'm not
[15:35.640 --> 15:39.080]  gonna lie there was a time when I grew up where I ate play-doh so I could there
[15:39.080 --> 15:42.640]  are happy tones to it and I didn't mean to make it sound bad by saying that
[15:42.640 --> 15:48.120]  because no I think play-doh is a great as I recall it was a lovely aroma so
[15:48.120 --> 15:53.280]  anyway so your question was what about the Mac attracts you so much the aroma
[15:53.280 --> 15:58.600]  is just to die and then the the plant itself when it's growing it grows rock
[15:58.600 --> 16:03.920]  hard nugs that are both like sparkly with resin as well as like purple
[16:03.920 --> 16:10.740]  splashes come out and it flowers a little long it's probably 65 to 70 day
[16:10.740 --> 16:15.580]  you know but that's not exceptionally long either for what you get but the
[16:15.580 --> 16:21.260]  yield is so amazing in the sense that the buds are so dense that when you
[16:21.260 --> 16:27.060]  harvest the cola that is of a certain length and diameter and you compare that
[16:27.060 --> 16:31.180]  to the say another cola of a different strain of the same length and diameter
[16:31.180 --> 16:36.380]  the density on the Mac is so much greater it'll weigh for example I
[16:36.380 --> 16:41.380]  usually dry cure and trim my weed and put it in mason jars as many people do
[16:41.380 --> 16:46.020]  and then you'll weigh the mason jar when it's completely full and a typical jar
[16:46.020 --> 16:52.220]  is like 60 grams when it's full the Mac I've had it hit like 90 grams when a
[16:52.220 --> 16:57.940]  jar is full you know it's that yeah half again no 50% greater because to go from
[16:57.940 --> 17:03.860]  60 to 90 you have to take 50% of 60 and add to it right so it's a 50% increase
[17:03.860 --> 17:10.100]  in density over a typical strain so that pays you back big time on your
[17:10.100 --> 17:14.500]  investment of having grown it and that when it hits the shelf and it's weighed
[17:14.500 --> 17:20.380]  and sold you've got gold there right and add that to the fact that it looks super
[17:20.380 --> 17:25.580]  desirable and smells super desirable and the high is sublime and lovely it's not
[17:25.580 --> 17:31.180]  a sleepy high it's not like an energetic I just drank two shots of espresso I
[17:31.340 --> 17:36.620]  have the Durban tie and that's what I use for Durban tie c99 and that one if
[17:36.620 --> 17:41.660]  you smoke the pure Durban tie it's like you just shot of espresso and you're
[17:41.660 --> 17:45.180]  running around waxing the ceilings and yeah that's where the raciness comes
[17:45.180 --> 17:50.460]  from see you know I always I say my Cindy 99 is really nice and heady but
[17:50.460 --> 17:54.980]  it's also like a really wonky cup of coffee and you know it's one of my
[17:54.980 --> 17:58.780]  favorite daytime smokes as a result Cinderella 99 was always known for that
[17:58.780 --> 18:02.340]  you know in those days you didn't find too many strains where it gave you that
[18:02.340 --> 18:07.820]  up high and the energy boost but that definitely is well back then they were
[18:07.820 --> 18:11.420]  also associated with being lower THC volumes when they gave you that feeling
[18:11.420 --> 18:15.140]  which today's market actually and with the help of your breeding techniques
[18:15.140 --> 18:20.980]  have kind of astoundably changed that resin production the expectation for
[18:20.980 --> 18:25.940]  resin production is so much of a higher bar now you know it's been raised a lot
[18:25.940 --> 18:32.140]  from the days like the 90s or whatever but Cinderella it's funny I've seen some
[18:32.140 --> 18:36.460]  really great posts where people go there's nothing outdated about this I
[18:36.460 --> 18:40.780]  thought that was one of the cutest things they could say but I should get
[18:40.780 --> 18:44.540]  back to the booth because there's people sure sure they're coming to buy seeds
[18:44.540 --> 18:47.700]  and I'd like to be there for that
[18:55.940 --> 18:58.000]  you
