something I was yeah I just use them have you ever heard of terrabossa no it's a this
guy he started his own company one of my partners just worked with them for a while but it's
just like a fermented different mixture of herbs and there's like some ginger in there
some garlic and how do you like like t-e-r-r-a and then b-o-s-a terra bosa yeah uh i'm just
looking it up it's magic you just put now i want to check it out that's why i'm trying
to find is he on instagram or uh because i just did like a google search i don't know
you know my partner's friends with him and he gets the bottle from him and it's a concentrate
and i know we saved the bottle because i was like i gotta i want to know who this guy is
kind of thing okay so it's fermented and it's a bunch of uh what'd you say is in there i
on the back of the bottle i remember it says uh it's like rosemary thyme oregano ginger
garlic uh i think some turmeric but i know it's all fermented in molasses kind of like
a like an ohn right yeah i do ffj we uh go to the grocery store uh organic market here
and all this stuff they throw away we get it because we have a my partner has like a
real license and microgreens look at that sorry so someone was asking where's the drying
so i had to throw up my uh seven year old is my uh artist in residence and uh it's nice
that was obviously a flower and uh a fashionable woman a fashionista potentially jemma uh i'm
not sure who that is though um okay so so and and so you mix that with like what's the
kind of dilution you were doing on it do what what was the so you just did a foliar spray
on the farm with that so did you i assume you diluted it yeah you go like i did one
and a half ounce uh per gallon of it and reason being if you go you can go up to
about two and a half three ounces on it per gallon before you start risking burning um
but uh it's uh it's really great for powdery mildew as well it's probably the number one thing
i've seen that's not popular uh for powdery mildew and you know growing anything in the
winter time i don't care where you're at uh west coast east coast midwest wherever you run into
powdery mildew issues in the winter time and if growers say oh no no they're lying uh you got i
mean no matter what you do you gotta spray your mother plants especially if you're doing seed
rows in the winter like a lot of us guys do instead of flower um i got geothermal heated
greenhouses here i'm very lucky so like you're sending the air below the surface through tubes
and then back out the other side or what's now we actually have i think it's about 450
foot geothermal well and the geothermal water system runs through all out about uh three acres
the greenhouses here and it um hey floyd uh floyd you're muted so you got to pick a microphone
yeah so it's really awesome it's super sustainable uh compared to guys you know
blasting any kind of natural gas or propane um it's extremely expensive to blast all that and
ours is more sustainable now that's awesome that i mean not many people have that going on but uh
and how many what's your square footage that you're of cultivation but is it you have in or
greenhouse stuff going on but i assume you're also doing outdoor yeah we do outdoor in the spring in
the summer and fall obviously and then just we do do some um depths in the spring in our greenhouses
we have about 9 000 square feet that's capable of that and that's satisfying
all right so all right floyd uh you know click on hold on i'm trying to get floyd in here uh
yeah so if you go into if you go into cam mic or your settings and then pick a speaker source
and you may have to kill the uh
it looks like you're wearing uh some bluetooth headphones maybe take them out and see if and
put them in the case and see if that works yeah yeah let me hear we can hear you floyd say something
no no no take them out take them take yeah yeah you just put them back in
yes we can hear you now now i can't hear you guys
okay so floyd do you have normal uh
like tethered things you can plug in
or like something like or wait hold on look at me i'm on my phone and these guys
and these guys are having trouble on the computers what's funny is that float we've
been here before uh like uh oh i don't think you can hear us okay put put your things back in
put them back in and he asked me to be on it today hold on a couple other guys everyone can
watch the fun we have uh put your ear buds back on
do you see look my god
yes there we go
okay so now you can hear me right give me a thumbs up if you can hear we cannot hear you
so here's here's our power here's our advanced move keep the earbuds in but go to
this place so for the microphone pick your computer speakers not your earbuds but for
the speakers which is how you're hearing us keep it on the earbuds you can you can pick your
microphone and your speaker source so if you go into settings cam mic and then audio is a setting
in the audio you have uh mic and then you also have uh speakers which is how you're hearing us
up there's thomas let's see if thomas thomas we're doing great we're uh helping floyd with his
technical issues um floyd stick your finger in your nostril if you can hear me
yes okay he can hear me so that means that your speakers are uh are your earbuds now for your mic
do you see how you have all these different options default
uh do whatever it is that's not the earbuds that's like your computer speakers
i just sprayed over there that's why it's lights are off
and there we are alternatively if you just want to jump back on and try like on your phone or
something and see if that works or leave the room and come back in maybe just try to leave the room
and come back in oh i actually you're also actually unmute yourself let's see if we can hear
you you gotta un you see the unmute
this is bad
okay now yes yes we're in yes you can hear me we can hear you okay hell yeah all right
but so everybody do not floyd's breed floyd's strength is in breeding amazing uh i'm not tech
savvy yes technology is not his strength he has his strength elsewhere instagram is hard for me
okay guys yes floyd just spends his days toiling on a farm yes uh not on technological devices good
do i even need these in my ears well are you here though oh yeah i mean it for style you could
keep them in the ears but otherwise you probably don't need if i take them out can you still hear
me yes yeah okay screw it i don't need these things then all right all right i hope the uh
the internet audience is going wild right now uh oh yin yang i sent you all right let me let me
send it to him again uh he's he's in the chat uh all right okay so while i do him why don't you set
the table of what we're talking about and uh i'll shut up cool so yeah i mean we're we're just here
to kind of you know discuss uh minors and mixed ratio cannabis um uh so i figured you know first
off we probably just go around and introduce all of us um so i'm a floyd at hoku seed company
we're here in the pacific northwest washington state on the west side of the cascades um pretty
rainy but uh but yeah we've got a hemp uh small little hemp farm here that we grow indoor or
greenhouse flower and uh do some uh breeding focused on um a lot of the miners and legal
cannabinoids we also have you know interested in in regular cannabis as well but uh but yeah
um so that's that's a little bit about me um and then we got thomas from uh high alpine
you want to say something by yourself thomas
i've always wanted to be a seed breeder i guess sorry sorry i'm just trying to get better
a seed breeder so uh you know i like made a business plan you know one to uh
to i guess make a thc uh seed company and then i just fell upon hemp and you know i love cbd
my whole family uses it uh for medicinal purposes so uh as soon as i started growing some of these
plants like t1 the wife and the cherry i was like oh my god these are better than some of the thc i
ran from that year so uh right then you know i crossed them with cobbler and made my first uh
my first cross and yeah it's been a whirlwind ever since and thank god with this covered but
i don't know wear a mask all day you know what i'm saying but yeah so anyway just trying to
provide the best genetics to the the hemp community you know uh something that they
all can grow something that's open source and something that's not oregon cbd so
just trying to bring out the fire this year really
and we got us we got clay hemp mcclay over there down in oregon
hey what's happening can you hear me yeah i can hear you now all right cool yeah
i know you were in first so you might have had you know you might have said a little bit about
yourself but uh but yeah you want to break it down where you're where you got in oregon
we're in clama falls and uh there's not a lot going on down
yeah like us and a few other guys who jumped in the game went a little strong and a little too
strong and so they're not really in the game anymore so there's not many of us left down here
but uh i do focus on you know all kinds of uh mixed ratios uh right now we're doing mixed ratios
mixed ratios uh right now we're doing mixed ratio stuff with the varin the varinetic acid
and uh cbdv to cbd one to ones and um you know trying to find some other thcv dominant hemp
with uh hopefully some cbg one to one someday something crazy like that but we uh we do have
um my main focus was finding that cbdv many years ago on a lucky find which uh some of the big wigs
call a needle in the haystack and i got really lucky on it i was looking for cbg and out of
some santeca 70 i don't know if y'all know what that stuff is but it's it's is that monascious
is that a monascious variety or is that yeah um so it was out crossed with like some cherry wine
but i'm not exactly sure what that all entailed with that i just got the seeds from this fella
and i was like i won't give him a try and go through them and i literally had a couple hundred
on popped a bunch of them had monoscetial tendencies uh which is you know in layman's
terms from aphroditic in layman's terms they got you know balls and hairs which is common
like grain varieties right they actually they breed that into the grain varieties so that they
can produce more grain and kind of have that pollen drop on the same plant i think is common
if i yeah i'm not even as far i know the grain varieties that they do grow over there in europe
are from um i know they believe that's the easiest way for seed production and get good
yields for sure but uh you know i have other opinions on that development to jump in jump into
on this right now about seed production out outdoors but um i do have some schemes on that
which a couple of you guys do know break some world records that shit i don't know if i can
sorry we we've had a few uh cusses uh over the years yeah so i'll keep that down but uh
anyway yeah back to mixed ratio stuff the cbdv i got lucky with it i i chose one plant
not kidding out of several hundred um that didn't have monoscetial tendencies
one was the biggest thing two i always go by stem rub like a lot of us do um there's a big
reflection of the terpene profile in the flower and had this really loud stem rub and then i was
like whoa cool it had beautiful structure and i was like see this is my plant so i sent the
leaf sin for ratio testing to the lab and came back something crazy it was a 26.6 to 1 cbdv to thc
22 to 1 cbd to thc and so it made it a 1.2 to 1 cbdv to cbd and i was like whoa man this is crazy
and one of my other breeder buddies hit me up on it nick strohberg from open source genetics and
um he uh was like what do you got there and so it's kind of been like my focus back and forth
and around and around done some out crosses with it done some inline breeding with it
and floyd's got some of it a couple other people got some of the out crosses and um really the goal
is just to like have some you know cool one-to-one cbdv to cbd um plants out there for people and
that's all that's like floyd and i i know thomas's too goal is just to have some really
cool plants that we put a lot of work into get them out to customers because we're at the end
of the day we're growers i'm a farmer you know i have been and i want to grow cool stuff you know
and so why wouldn't everybody else and i mean i know that should be what everybody thinks but it's
not in the industries um so yeah like i mean floyd put it one way the other day about our
passive finding mixed ratios and breeding them it's a little slower process than the big guys
but yeah i you know no i mean i kind of look cool yeah i kind of look at us i mean we're
you know a lot of us are self-taught you know we don't have come from like uh you know breeding
backgrounds i mean i have a few like textbooks and i can make it through like the first four
chapters before it gets too too technical and before you know like we're conventional breeders
right i mean we're right we have access to testing which is a huge part in the hemp industry is we're
actually doing the chemotype testing um which you don't see a lot of you know on the cannabis side
i mean they're you know it's which they're just mainly producing thc dominant cannabis but um
but yeah i mean we're i i kind of look at us as like we're self-taught we're craft growers i mean
we kind of got into this you know with a passion for the plant and uh even yin yang if we can get
him on here eventually too like you know he's uh it says it in his name you know he's focused on
one-to-ones but we're we don't really you know i kind of look at us as like kind of the misfits or
the outcasts like we're not really walking one lane you know we're kind of blending the hemp
industry the cannabis side of things and really just looking at the whole plant because it is
just one plant and that's what we kind of have to remember and it's we're you know we're lucky to be
alive at a time where we're able to kind of crack this plant open with uh you know with testing and
really do the chemotype hunting and so like we may not have like you know the equipment to do
pre-screening and in the pcr equipment so generally what we do is you know we'll pop seed and then
we're doing you know we're we're doing like the selections like clay was saying like we're you
know we're we're growing up going off structure and and profile and yields and then and then you
know you dive into the chemotype testing too and so i mean our path might be a little longer in the
long run but i mean i think in in the long run the you know what we're producing is going to be
completely different than somebody else that has a different style of breeding that that's maybe just
you know growing thousands of plants pre-screening for chemotype and then going that way you know
we're kind of it's just a little different style i mean and we are conventional breeders like you
know so using some of the tools that we have access to but uh you know we're not rich either
so it's like you know our our main and i've kind of come to terms with that too is like
what's kept me alive is is moving into the greenhouse flower production you know and i'm sure
i'm sure clay can say the same thing about uh bills it's the flower that pays the bills you
know and the seed and the breeding is kind of the passion stuff so what's up yin yang
lauren hey can you guys hear me yep welcome welcome to the show yeah thank you
so yeah we were just going around telling a little bit about about ourselves uh i know
you're out there in colorado with thomas if you want to just kind of break down uh
you know what you're what you're doing over there and kind of your focus
yeah hey everybody hey hey clay nice to meet you nice to meet you what's up buddy
so thanks peter for doing this first of all yeah thanks for pushing it thanks for everybody yeah
so yeah i'm out of colorado i'm out of lions i got a little retail shop here cbd um focused on cbd
initially about seven years ago but crossing cbd into thc is where it kind of started and
then focused on cbd breeding only for a couple of years and started to work some of the stuff in that
i had that was thc only breeding some cbd into it and just really like the results
so just kept running with it and excited to do some collaborations with you guys and
learn more about the uh the recessive part of cbd dominance or cbd inheritance to just continue to
keep stacking i want to get into the if i can the low 30s combined cannabinoids
so yeah that's my thing yin yang seeds and just quickly i i muted everyone else
so when you want to talk just unmute yourselves okay
all right but that's pretty much me anybody has any questions let me know
so yeah yeah dude it's exciting i mean this has been a long time coming it's it's it's pretty
cool i mean we've all kind of uh you know been involved with each other a little bit i think uh
you know me and thomas go back we can clay kind of go back uh it started you know my i think my
entry into the minor world was uh picking up some uh early kind of fiber cbd dominant genetics
from europe which uh then thomas was kind enough to kind of you know find me and pull me in and
sell some of my seeds my seeds on his site and that kind of you know kind of catapulted and kind
of uh the hoku seed you know company and then uh clay you know i mean he reached out to me early
on i think i shared a cut of that bernabéu which is you know it's it's fivery now and in hindsight
it's kind of funny you know that we even were playing around with it but you know it got us
to this point um and so you know i kind of reached and all these guys like uh even you know
i've grown a lot everybody you know here yin yang clay thomas i've grown all their gear out you know
i mean we sell i sell yin yang seeds and clay seeds on our website um and all the seeds that
i sell you know we we grow you know we kind of grow and test out ourselves and it's like uh
and so we're all you know i mean in some ways we're just kind of a collective of breeders too
working with each other testing each other's gear sharing clones sharing seeds um and i think it's
a mutual love for the plant that kind of brought us together um and a love for miners and kind of
just the uniqueness of what this plant can do and uh and it's not just we're not just chasing miners
for the fun of it you know i mean it all it comes back to the power of the plant and in what it can
do medicinally and so um without you know taking too much of the time i just see you know i think
a lot of the bigger companies and breeding facilities you know have access to these but
they'll never you know i mean even you know you saw not throw them under the bus but oregon cbd
throwing out triploid cbdb seeds you know and it's just it's a cool tech and all but you know
you can't really breed with that stuff either and not that you you'd want to because they have you
know transfer agreements but i think a lot of our goal too is is to get some of these minor you know
rich genetics and mixed ratios into the hands of other people um that can take them further you
know and it's not just you know we're not trying to kind of you know hoard hoard these genetics in
fact i mean i think a lot of us are just trying to get them out into the world too you know and
and be able to produce them for ourselves you know so we can enjoy them but i mean we're realizing i
mean you know we all just saw that uh that study from osu right the cbda and cbga and it's like
we've known forever that this plant is powerful medicine and that's just it's just one more proof
um and so you know what else do these cannabinoids do and i think you know we're all i mean even
thomas like a cut that i worked with recently was his dream tonic you know and that that
consistently puts out three percent cbc and it's like i may not know exactly what it does medicinally
but i sure want to find out so it's you know um and i don't know if anybody you know you guys can
talk on you know some of your interests i mean my you know my focus for the next year um is really
the cbg and thcv side of the cannabinoids um especially uh i've got you know and then i've
also got uh some interest in the cbdv which um clay was kind enough to share some two-to-one
pollen with me that i actually just crossed to a you know a strain that or a cultivar that he made
which was uh his cbdv strain the i think the 22 to 1 out crossed with cbg variety so you know a
lot of it is mashing up these these uh these minor rich you know cultivars and just and then
pheno hunting them and seeing what we can pull out um the next one of our next kind of big interests
i was just talking to clay with this about this was the is cbgv um so i think this is the year
the barons i think you know you're gonna see a lot of cbdv rich genetics out there thcv is is
is creeping up behind um and i think cbgv is right behind it so yeah can you define a baron
uh i can somebody help me with that i mean as far as so the vanaric acid is um
it's it's travels on i mean on the pathway that we know of
and they all kind of have more of a stimulation effect um yeah uh really i guess cbdv i've
seen in some studies i've read that it can almost even mimic nicotine when you inhale it the flower
so which oh you know i'm gonna pop in here real quick trying to get off cigarettes more so than
just smoking a cbd um you know kind of deal and thcv i know for women are using it and vaping
it for weight loss because it's such an appetite suppressant so let me pop in here so like i i
just want to remind everybody too like you know we're we're kind of like and i mean i don't mean
to you know kind of downplay it but we're all like self-taught pollen chuckers like we're not
you know we don't have a background in chemistry or plant you know biology um like i approach this
you know as a breeder with an interest in the medicinal aspect of the plant so i think what
what clay is reaching for is like what we're after is the effects if that means thcv can give me a
stimulant like effect from the plant in a natural form then i'm all for it you know and it's like
if cbg can help with my gut issues i don't really need to know the you know all the nomenclature and
all the scientific you know jargon behind what cbd is i just need to know how it makes me feel
you know and that that's kind of the beautiful thing with this plant is like i i don't consider
myself a breeder like i consider myself you know a lover of the plant and a pollen checker like
i make selections you know i don't you know and i mean i do test for chemotypes and but at the end
of the day like it's you know we're we're breeding for effect we're breeding to find these compounds
and uh and share them with the community because you know i mean i think i think we have enough
pharmaceuticals at this point like the beautiful the beautiful thing with this plan is is if we
can isolate some of these newer compounds that have different effects than just thc cbd uh and cpg
you know which are kind of commonplace now um then maybe we can you know create new medicines
with the plant new extracts that do different things you know if it can help you quit smoking
yeah that's awesome you know if it can help you lose some weight you know and that's i think that's
where we're coming at the barren side of things um is is from that aspect you know so like when
you say you know what is a barren like i don't know you know i mean it's it's a cannabinoid in
the plant you know and we and we just happen to be alive in the you know in the day and age where
we have access to those genetics and can actually you know determine if it has high amounts of
of cbgb in it or thcb so um yeah i mean it's you know and a lot of this is anecdotal like
you know people people are trying these new cannabinoids and and we don't really know what
they do and in fact like a lot of them in isolate form aren't very pleasant to take and so then it
comes back to the entourage effect and i mean we can go down all kinds of rabbit holes because i
mean i know a lot of you guys know that there's isomers that are created from cbd and uh in cbg
and essentially it's you know like it's just become a precursor at this point i mean you can
find del you know you can find delta 9 delta 9 hemp derived thcb delta you know so it's like
but those are isomers those are you know made in a lab converted and i think our
our goal is to create those in the plant and that's you know so you know um so yeah if somebody
can speak to that but i just want to clarify that i mean i yeah um so i don't know i used to do a
lot of chemotype testing specifically and that's how i would breed is really the chemotype testing
what we're talking about but uh i don't know um you know i dream to be a plant breeder you know
what i mean so i did i did go to school for to cal poly san luis obispo for plant breeding
i'm just a carpenter yeah but uh you know what i mean no we can all do just the same thing and
that's why i like to talk to everyone is because everyone's keyed into the akashica record you
know differently so you know people don't know anything or people don't know a lot you know it's
still like uh floyd teaches me so much every day about like electricity and uh you name it building
walls or anything like that i could just call floyd i'll be like oh man my my heat pump's not
working what's wrong with this and he's like oh you fucked it up man but uh you know like um
i don't know where i was going with that but i'm super excited about your cbdv cut
clay i got some cbdv i got the sedative and i made some s1s of that so i really would like
to take that cbdv and hit it to the sedative and make some early season which is an autumn
yeah the sedatives and auto flower yeah so the sedatives then we can have early season varieties
and then new auto flowers uh cbdvs as well but uh i did hit it to the uh t1 to uh the dream tonic
also the pink panther so we should be able to pull out some auto flowers from pink panther and
shaolin glow and also i have alpenglow sedative cbdv um just throwing that out there so i'll
probably put those up uh if anyone wants to play with them on the website some here sometime i just
have to shuck i have like i have like weeks worth of shucking to do and stripping of seeds so i don't
know and then we're trying to go to the cannabis cup kallen barry and i from uh up north genetics
we're both entering the cannabis cup with the pink panther so hopefully we can win that but uh
yeah if anyone wants a super high terpene variety you know these uh alpenglow crosses they just make
ridiculous high terpene super high medicinal varieties but um i don't know where i was going
with that but i just wanted to jump in there and say something but anyway yeah i mean it's well
and so like as a hemp breeder that's essential right like because we're we're kind of limited by
um you know thc content so it's essential i mean basically we're all chemotype breeders you know
because i mean you know we're rather than just you know smashing two plants together we really
have to be aware of of you know of what cannabinoids and and in what ratios that those
plants produce especially at full maturity um even though i think we all have interest in mixed ratios
um and some even like yin yang that's his main focus right is is is those those kind of cbd thc
mixed ratio strains which i think are making a comeback you know i don't know if they're making
a comeback but they're you know more and more people are kind of discovering them and i think
it's it's uh there's a huge lack in the marketplace like when you hop on a thc seed bank
um it's all thc genetics you know there there's not not really a lot of of mixed ratio or minor
rich genetics out there in fact if you want to go find miners i'd go to a landrace seed bank
yeah that's what uh that's what those european seed banks are good for
is you know they just uh i don't know they do so much crazy breeding over there you know not a lot
of people are breeding different cannabinoids besides thc here so that's what those european
seed banks are really good for and that's what floyd taught me a lot is uh go to a can of pot and
just you know all the best breeders are on can of pot you know what i mean so you know that's where
originally the you know the alpenglow came from you know it was a pink crush purple dial uh
xenobia black rose just chose the best females of those and kept uh pushing them together but uh
you know that's sedativa you know so it seems like all the new shit over the years just on uh
you know it's like searching through seed banks you know and that's what i feel like the craziest
people do but also you know that's where you can be most successful is you know finding these new
varieties that no one's actually pulled out and using them uh commercially you know what i mean
so i don't know that sedativa is a little weird it a lot of it's like a little larvae it's like
indica kind of structure but there is a sativa the one i used as a pollen donor was actually a
sativa leaner and i do have s1 select is only partially reversed uh luckily it did just because
my uh my employee made the silver solution i used it he messed it up but anyway uh so it it you know
it doesn't have the greatest buzz structure in the world it's beautiful but it smells really nice
is the good thing but it's no alpha though you know what i mean so i think um still think we got
a lot of work to do i don't know how that i don't know how organ cbd cbdb is a lot of people say it's
beautiful but i'm sure it's no uh regular cbd cut if you know yeah i just i just planted a tray of it
i forget what it's i think it's the pine walker so we'll see how it is yes i was gifted some seeds
from our buddy over in europe so we'll see uh oh yeah what it's all about i mean i don't and that's
again you know like i don't a lot of the stuff that i grow you know it's obviously there's you
can't breed with but you know if you don't if you don't see what's out there it's kind of hard to
compare and you know what i mean it's i don't know i think even you know clay and yin yang i mean we
all you know i mean we're constantly popping seed you know even if it's if it's not doesn't go
anywhere and especially with these these minor rich genetics i mean a lot of them are being pulled out
of like clay said santika some of them are found in land races so you know they need a lot of work
and it's just you know like i said we're at that you know a time in history where we can actually
do the testing and really start doing the work and making them you know kind of uh into a
commercial viable cultivar so i think that's kind of you know i mean a lot of this stuff is in its
infancy so but like you said you were talking about bernard bale and you say you laugh at it
now but i think it's still a great variety and i'm going to hop back into it the bbx just because
so i was talking to some guys from europe and apparently the matterhorn is the santika 70 cross
to the white um who knows it's supposedly but this is this is uh some brand new news so it
seems like everything has a little bit of the white in it so that's what's really nice about
the burna bale is you know it's an unknown common goal across and apparently was found in a police
raid in 2001 and given to a university in italy and then that's where it it started from so i think
the burner bay was a like an original starting place and we have to jump back there into those
bbx that you got or anything else you know i mean yeah some you know original cbg that's not
you know essentially the white you know but you know i have kind of a distaste for um that company
oh yeah yeah hey maybe uh so let's just go around maybe and like yin yang what what uh
what uh do you have planned for the the upcoming year i know you're doing some thc fems and got
some uh mixed more mixed ratios coming down i i know i'm gonna grow some of your seeds out this
year yeah i'm focused on helping a buddy with production strains i'm looking at a couple like
a blue dream that i crossed abacus into that brought a lot more vigor a little bit of cbd
and uh it was a fem reversal of abacus that was pretty difficult to do which gave me confidence
that it's pretty intersects uh stable abacus as a strain so i've worked with that a lot and
i want to continue with that but there are a couple of lines that i did
ping pong and back between the two i haven't done a lot of testing on
uh the results yet as far as the ratios and that's what i'd love to talk about next with
you guys it's just the inheritance of thc and cbd i know it stacks on a different allele and
the genetic code so it's not always a straightforward sort of math issue it's more of an inheritance
issue but um yeah as far as stabilizing some of those ratios it's like you were saying about some
of the minors i think all of our goal is to actually stabilize stuff in seed form
and empower people to grow their own medicine that's my personal goal because i remember back
when i grew out some of the cbd crosses that i that i made are the thc crosses rather with cbd in
them i had that kind of experience where i didn't have paranoia like i do with a lot of modern
polyhybrids that are thc only i don't like the paranoia i don't like the anxiety i don't like
the rush um you know i i like to be a little calm and stress-free when i smoke weed so i was looking
for that again and i had that old school kind of hash experience that had some cbd in the mix
just because genetically it was still in some of the land races that started a lot of the
a lot of the uh you know the origins of us using this plant recreationally there were always some
cbd in the mix and when i bred that back into the thc genetics it just to me that was what i was
looking for that was my sweet spot and then next i found a strain that had like a real creamy it
was actually harry potter kush a couple years ago super low producer really um you know a hype
cookie strain but it had a lot of the effects that i actually like the cream the little bit of
limiting a little bit of uplifting but also calming it calm my anxiety i bred some cbd into
it the bread apicus into it so i found like what i call my strain that i liked the effects of based
on not just the chemotype and the chemovars the chemicals in it but the terpenes so that's my next
goal is to just mash up some of these polyhybrids with some cbd genetics to give people a little bit
less of a rocket rocket ship experience a little bit more of like you know a tasty calming kind of
medicinal effect that you want to come back to and that's my goal is to just mash up some of
these hype strains that have crazy flavors crazy turps but then bring them back into some cbd world
genetics to just kind of cool them down just kind of rain them rain them in a little oh yeah
no i've been i've been loving uh the cbdbt or sorry cbdthc you know one to one i've just been
mixing the blue panther with everything because uh i don't know i want the high a little bit more
it's uh yeah i don't know it's definitely good for a daytime you know it's definitely good for
yeah when you need that focus and you're trying to get get shit done versus like
nighttime where you're just chilling out you know so how about you oh i'm sorry i was trying to hit
that abacus flow i i tried to germinate some seeds but i got too busy i got
overwhelmed with orders and wasn't able to plant them right away so i'm going to try them again but
yeah so i'm going to hit that to legendary og here so we should have uh abacus flow legendary
and then i got floyd's uh what is that scooter it's a biscotti cross yeah that's ava
eraser yeah that's right yeah clay's got yeah clay's got some of those two going
what do you got going this year clay i know you you showed me your room the other day dude and
it's like it just i was just drooling over some of the stuff you had popped oh man uh
no this year it's uh like you said it's kind of like the year of the barons but
um i do have some of your uh cbg crosses that you did with some thc like with the jokers
i found this really good smelling one actually and uh you know the magic's always in the f2s
when you do that which kind of or you're making an s1 which is an s2 i mean an f2 out of an f1 you
know basically so uh i am making uh my bubba's vendetta the cbdv the cbd i'm making s2s um
i'm not gonna have a lot but i probably am gonna release them just because it's like
you know who knows what's gonna happen next year i need medicine out to some people you know
banks really i mean it's it'll be really stable and at best too there's a lot of work in it there's
a lot of finances in it as well as far as just testing and um growth space and time
i am going to cross the bubba's vendetta with your cbg
circles f2s i got them going try to look for some cbgv the magic's on that uh f2s of that as well
i don't expect to find any cbgv in the f1 at all um yeah i'm just looking for a minor
dominance and something that i like like uh
with uh turps and uh things like that and if it's just got a little bit of v in it take that to the
f2 and you'll magically pop up 10 15 percent of that seed is going to be cbgv dominant you know
and um that's cool so there's a lot of cool things like uh one-to-ones as far as thc and cbd
i do have a few fun ones up my sleeve um those i'm kind of far behind on all those compared to
thomas even and you floyd and you uh on yin yang i mean definitely behind but you're my you're my
weapon
i really think that bubba's been dead is kind of my thing and i don't want to say it like this but
a lot of like the cbdv you will see out in the industry in these next like years is going to
be all from my original cut that i found um yeah which is cool which is cool right i'm not this is
it swiss is going to be releasing about 300 000 seeds nick the valerie and um
nick and i are probably going to release an early flowering he's been working on
up here cbdv auto beacon yeah but the problem is that is we're gonna i'm gonna just do that
through him so he's probably gonna do mta on that but uh on my bubba's v there's always me
i'm not gonna do no mta you know i'm just gonna i'm gonna charge for him though if you know what
i'm saying but it'll get him out there uh yeah so um i got those that's about i mean i have way
other projects i have a quad cannabinoid that i am going through the f1 of now i showed floyd that
the other day it's i made some s1s of the doug's variant thcv one to one thcv to thc cultivar that
floyd and i and a few of us all got and um we've all done a bunch of fun stuff with that west coast
here a couple years ago yeah yeah it's a it's it's just such a lanky punk long flowering it
it doesn't yeah it's only good for extraction and even herbs are all right on it then
yeah yeah it's very strong in lemonade for sure yeah um but i found i did s1s of it floyd had
on his site but they're not far between yeah i went through some of them found a really awesome
one that actually had really good bud structure smashed it with the bubba's v because when you
do that you cross the one to one to one to one which is super minor stuff if you want to talk
about all that we're talking about in that f1 you will find a quad cap which is cool and in f2
you're gonna find whatever you want to take a direction you'll start stabilizing it
and it's all kinds of stuff so i'm really excited about those i'm gonna send them in a flower in
about two weeks um and uh hopefully i have good luck because it'd be great to have a true
stabilized quad cab they actually had some turps um and rsos strain man i was up you can have uh
cbdb is it nice the auto have you seen it the cbdb auto yeah have you seen he's done a lot of work
on it oh really i haven't talked to him lately really honestly he is
oh yeah no i was just wondering how it how it looked
he
can can you hear thomas guys hear me i think i'm breaking up
yeah you're a little chattery okay you got it
yeah you're good nope there you go how is uh how is beacons uh cbdb auto have you have you seen it
have you grown it out or have you have you got a chance to see any pictures
he sent me pictures and i know he's done a lot of work on it and he finally sent me some pollen
from like he like reversed like a thousand this favorite one from a bunch of selection before that
so yeah no the cbdb is
what were you saying clay you're breaking up uh his the cbdb auto i know he says this
is
hey peter if he pops off the camera and just yeah clay maybe just kill the if you stop the camera
and just do audio only okay yeah just stop cam yep there you go can you hear us
oh is that right yep is it can you hear me better oh yeah yeah yes all right well let's just do this
so um yeah the uh cbdb auto i know he's got a lot of work in that a lot uh i met up with nick
um about two and a dude might be three uh now with it and he traded me a bunch of his um
cush crosses kind of hush hush with them due to the nature of them and uh floyd actually is
rocking out i went through a bunch of this selection is probably some of the like like
with thomas's stuff and all it's probably up it's up there as far as
hey we traded and uh he's an auto master he loves thc world auto he's kind of really
known in that world in california he has been for less like 10 years in the medical world with
being the auto and they're awesome and i ran some of the cbd autos and they're awesome but the
cbd v just quickly uh clay we're having you're breaking up do you want to leave the room and
come back in that may uh make the wi-fi magically work better if you just leave and then just click
the link again and come back in okay okay and then uh floyd do you want to translate uh all
the missing words in his uh thing like who was he talking about in california yeah so so so it's
kind of interesting so a lot of the cbd v genetics that are coming out that are open source um came
from that one unicorn that clay found a couple years ago like i think he was talking about the
beginning it was a 22 to 1 he uh he gave that to nick at beacon hemp who then ran with it and over
the last few years has really worked it into a beautiful auto flower line uh he also gave it to
matthias the swiss cannabinoid i think in europe and who's created a i think uh you know some pretty
awesome work it's like an indica leaning um chunky like i don't i forget what the ratio is i think
it's at least one to one i've seen some photos of it which are uh probably two guys you definitely
want to get on here um maybe with a little more experience than we have especially with testing
and a chemotype breeding because you know they're they're a little bit i think they have more
funding behind them and probably you know a little more resources you know but as far as us guys here
in the united states uh apart from nick i mean um you know we're we're still pushing forward but uh
but yeah so that i think that's what he was talking about as far as is that auto um and then you know
that one-to-one thcv is where a lot of the thc v genetics um that you're seeing pop up all stem from
so it's just pretty interesting to you know you look back and everything kind of has like an
origin story with a lot of them leading back to the same points and i think it goes to say like
you know in five ten years a lot of the cbd genetics particularly the open source ones are
going to stem from that initial find that clay found so um you know and and that just goes to
show the power of sharing genetics and not hoarding them you know it's because there's other guys out
there that have more resources that can they can take them farther than we can but um you know and
that's kind of my goal like i smash things together all the time we've got you know i got a lot of cbg
work a lot of thcv out crosses to cbd to you know land races to cbg um and then you know it goes back
to where he was talking about inheritance where a lot of these miners when you out when you cross
them in that f1 generation you're really not going to see much so like when i take a cbg and smash it
to a like one of my thc clone moms those those f1s are just going to be thc dominant with a little bit
of mixed ratio thc cbd and it's those mixed ratios that have the marker for you know um for cbg and so
you know you can take those and take them to the f2 and then you're going to start seeing cbg pop
back up so all these miners tend to be recessive in that first generation um you know so you either
got to back cross to mom or inbreed them to the next generation to really find the magic and so
like i would like you know where clay's saying you know he's he's asking for a you know he's going to
be asking for a premium price on his stable genetics whereas like i on the other hand i'll
release those f1s in hopes that somebody will okay well you know one step is already taken care of
i'm going to go and take those to f2 i think clay's doing a lot of that work um you know and i try to
be transparent with that it's like you know if you see a somebody says oh i got a cbg thc one-to-one
well in fact it's not really going to be a one-to-one you know it you know you can find
and actually the one-to-one mixed ratios are pretty rare those kind of can be the unicorns
but you can find them so um and so yeah that in that you know so we all we all kind of do things
a little differently um you know i'm i i'll do a single cross and push it out and then you know
kind of give people the the ability to run with it um so just quickly uh there are a bunch of
questions i just don't want them to get too far back do you guys see that one
for all the people who still have uh who don't need reading glasses
so yeah i mean i'll like it you know i'll do probably between 10 and 30 plants because i'm
limited by greenhouse space you know i know a lot of these guys will do more um and then i pay
40 bucks for potency test if i'm doing like 20 or more it's cheaper so i don't know if anybody else
can speak on that i think we're all muted you guys got to mute yourselves i got a lab in colorado's
35 a test uh they're really good they do four tests for every one test so they do two tests
at 100x two tests at 1x and they average them all together and they also have uh uh they do an eight
hour extraction time so the extraction time a lot of these labs you know i'll you know no offense to
any of these labs would say altitude consulting i was consistently you know where i would get 21 30
to 1 you know i mean usually 25 30 to 1 all the time i was getting like 10 15 to 1s you know like
higher thc than i've ever seen before and then i switched labs and i realized it was the lab so
really uh you want to make sure your lab has a really good uh i guess you know standard or you
know operating procedure for for uh testing so what they do is an eight hour extraction time
and that really you know it's a co2 extraction so it really extends the peaks in the valleys and you
see a lot more of these minor cannabinoids so i i really recommend checking them out um
if anyone wants their information just hit me up on instagram or just look at my coas and my coas
they're always on there but it's spectrum cbd botanicals but uh interestingly enough i was i was
just thinking about this and i wanted to ask clay testing for cbdb you know i when i was looking
through the syrians i was testing for thcv and what i realized the thcv it is uh it's a mature
cannabinoid so the thc actually goes from thc to thcv and there's a different wavelength that they
look for so really it's hard to do chemotype testing when you're you know you're in a
vegetative state which i usually do you know what i mean so i don't know if that works for cbdb as
well have you ever tested your baba's vendetta in the vegetative state and can you see that cbdb
or is it the same thing like thcv is there a wavelength uh you know like they have to look for
because is it mature cannabinoid like thcv or does it come straight out
can you hear me yeah yeah no i found it initially in the leaf ratio test
and then also how i went through my s1s i popped like a couple hundred of them
and i only have enough money because how floyd says it's 40 a test i i tested my top 15
and only two of them out of 15 came back cbdb one to one ish ratios yes and you find it in the leaf
yes so was that very dominant in the chemical leaf ratio test was that
across
selection was you can find it in leaf ratio test as well yeah but it'll be only about 10
yeah so that's what makes you baba's vendetta right your baba's vendettas
uh so baba's vendetta f1 i went through we were like swissy went through those
and he found what he calls the r5 which is his favorite through terps and structure
which was a two to one cbd to cbdb i took that because he sent it to me
from switzerland because i gave him my s1s my cbdb and i went through i made s1s of that
and how that s1s from that f1 are really f2s and so that's why only about 15 to 20 percent
of those s1s are cbdb dominant oh yeah so the next generation now since i found the varin
it will be stable in the s2 slash f3 oh cool so that's why when i'm selling these
people can take it right away find their favorite and make varin yeah so that's my deal
you know and it generally is the third generation right to stabilize i mean it takes about three
generations if if you know so when you're chemotype yep so to stabilize it so same way
with a one-to-one you know if you find like how you said floyd and you find a little bit of it in
f1 take it to that f2 and you find that dominant when you take it to that f3 bam it's locked you
gotta you gotta find the marker and sometimes it is you know sometimes sometimes like uh you know
like in our we did a the oz kush um it's a cbd by cbg cross and a lot of those you know have minor
you know two percent cbg you know so you can kind of pick whichever one you want and take those to
the next generation and now you've separated them you know now you'll find your cbds and your cbgs
and then you can basically die you know create two divergent lines out of that yep yeah um
yeah yeah the baron is that's my question for you clay that would be my question for you claire for
any of you guys as far as inheritance and it sounds like the veterans would be a double recessive like
the cbg allele which is basically a broken thc allele it sounds like it's a double recessive
which is similar to auto flower yeah it's yeah it all it yeah yeah where it needs to double stack
that double recessive trait for it to show up yep yeah so if anybody's familiar with auto
flower breeding you know those f1s are all early season right and then you know you can take those
to the f2 and you'll get you know autos and and early season and then you can kind of separate
them so yeah that's how people create new auto flower lines yeah from what i've seen they have
to get to about f5 for it to be 100 of the population yeah to be a lot of platinum well
i'm i'm pretty sure about this but i mean i think you know i think i can out cross and then back
cross and just use those auto flowers hit auto flower to auto flower and that should just be
auto flower genetics you know what i mean if you know if i got them on 18 to 24 hours of light
uh you know and i'm looking through so basically what i did is i hit the shaolin which is uh the
tangy standoff four across with alpenglow and then i back crossed it to the alpenglow
and then i'm going to use those as the pollen donors so hopefully this works out i have backup
pollen if it doesn't but i got 238 plants ready to go but so i'm planning on all those auto flowers
being two auto flowers and getting 75 percent back out so i don't know i think with the it's
good what you're saying is the uh double receptive allows us to see that true auto flower you know
i guess double wheel or whatever you know but right i don't know where i was going with that
but anyway yeah thanks for telling me about that clay i'm going to try it i think i'm going to try
to hit those alpenglows or maybe just uh i have the alpenglow sedativa if you want to play with
some of those i got some of those as well but try to f2 those i guess probably next right after this
this uh pollination and then see if we can't pull out some cbdbs from those
but because uh it's nice and all that cbdb but it's uh you know it's not alpenglow you know i mean
huh i'll send you some pollen when i make the s2s you know do some do some crashing that's what we
do floyd's gonna get some you know oh yeah man yeah you gotta get some too i'd love to i'll send
you back anything i make there you go that's how we work you hear that people that's what it is
yep so you see uh you guys see that question i mean as far as i know none of us have found cbgv
yet but uh we're on a mission i just did a so i have my that one-to-one the barons cut
i smashed it to a cbg auto and then just back crossed it to the cbg auto
so i mean as far as anything promising that's where i'm going to start looking
bubba's vendetta with your circles floyd and because the circles you you did really good job
on the f2s selecting your structure you know and i think that's one of the biggest things people
don't realize is that's like 98 percent of the words yep it's everything
yeah
you know and was like all right cool you know i'm not gonna do any more talking on it but that's
what i yeah so i think that's the biggest thing people don't realize is that you know
we're on a mission and we're gonna get some stuff done and we're gonna get some stuff done and we're
you know i'm not gonna do any more talking on it but that's what
yeah swiss is uh looks awesome i'm excited for that one yeah you know when people walk by
like something that my buddies are growing in mind for the second year or third year
they're like oh crap i want some of that you know and that's the feeling you want as a breeder and
i know it's the same way for all of ours works you know when you have that and people who give
you good feedback so um yeah i don't know where i was going with that one but the bubba's vendetta
with circles i'm excited for because they've both been selected through and through not just on
chemotype but on structure structure structure you know and then that's why i'm excited for
finding cbgv in that for sure you know because if it's got those structures and some turps like that
bam some of those circles even have a little little purple in them too
yeah and the bubs v is you go purple you know and yeah which is a bonus right which is what
yeah be cool you know and that's what we do this for and hopefully be able to pay the bills along
the way you know heck yeah man that's the goal is to do this for the rest of our lives right
right i mean i'm really hoping this fiber thing takes off of my area too not just can have annoyed
breeding you know um so but it's just such a you know you got such hype on it also you know so
whatever and ever but anyway yeah someone was asking about uh leaf testing they were asking
you clay but i've done a lot of leaf testing it's just a regular cannabinoid test so what you can
do is just you know generally leaf testing say dream tonic for example when i leave tested that
i just i leave tested all it was like i don't know 45 50 plants or something it was ridiculously
expensive but uh i went through all the leaf tests and i found you know ones with the highest thc
the lowest cbd so what you do is just come off like just like you would do a blood sample and
then you know you send it in for cannabinoid testing and you can really kind of see the
the chemotype and also the propensity to make thc so like that dream tonic it was like 0.04
0.08 uh thc at you know and then one was point it was 1.18 or 1.81 and the other one was like 2.05
percent cbd so really nice ratios 30 to 1 but what i've seen is the ratio is only increased in flour
especially if you grow them right so you know if i get a 30 to 1 in flour i know that thing is going
to or in a vegetative state i know it's going to be 30 to 1 and above in flour and then what i found
is the lower the thc it's really fun it's really strange because i i see more cbc come out when
that thc is super low or non-detectable it seems like there's other cannabinoids there that are
that are taking the energy of the uh of the thc so you know like that dream tonic the one that floyd
it was at 19 percent total cannabinoids when i tested it at 0.31 percent thc and that was like
it was game tonic sir yeah if you want compliance fire him yeah and outdoor is way different than
indoor you know so everyone grows indoor and then expects these numbers from outdoor and you know
it's it's really about um stress you know so you want to keep your stress super low even water
every single day and you know my buddy he grew he taught me that and he grew t1 in the beginning and
he got that thing at 14 at 0.3 and then that's t1 you know it's generally like 28 to 30 to 1 cut
so uh if you just water every single day you keep your stress level super low and then that'll keep
your thc super low as well hey clay do you still have that uh the quattro the cut then didn't you
have one that had a little little bit of cbdb and thcv or was that matias that had that had that
man that thing was so trashed you got put in the trash
oh it wasn't even worth wasn't even worth working huh
no i mean just man i don't know how to describe it you think that doug's bearing is bad yeah you
this thing it was it was bad i mean i took it to flower too for 12 weeks and it yeah man it's bad
yeah and that's it two minutes that's part of it right it's even if you have the compound sometimes
it's just not even worth the trouble yep like we said he didn't choose that that plant on structure
he chose it strictly on chemotype and that's what happens you know and so it's so like yeah
so like for me a lot of times like when i was hunting your cbdb i you know like i didn't even
really like i didn't end up testing any of the finished flower i just selected like the cbg by
cbdb cut that i kept was solely off of structure and terpene and so you know but now i have your
two-to-one cbdb pollen that i smashed it with and now i'm going to start chemotype testing you know
now i'm going to start you know um i'm going to dive through those and so i i you know i could
have spent a lot of money in the you know that first you know that first pheno hunt but you know
there's a lot of stuff that i just even if it had it i wouldn't care you know so i'm gonna i'm gonna
you know select off structure terpene profile i know it's in there somewhere and then if i take
that pollen that i know from clay that has the cbdb then you know i smash that all that so that's
that's my cbdb project and and the funny thing is is it's really it's really clay's because you know
that initial cross came from him and then i'm using his pollen so i mean a lot of the credit
goes to him as far as is the breeding material but i'm going to be doing the selection and it's you
know and that's part of it and that just goes to like you know we share these genetics knowing that
you know we don't have time to do everything we want to do and that uh you know people are going
to take different selections and different routes and in the end you know if we can share that back
with them it's that much better um so yeah i mean it's like i said it it takes an army you know and
and so it's that's and i just want to say this you know if you guys are in the comments and if
you guys share this if you're interested in minors and mixed ratios like reach out to us if you've
got something cool you know join the club you know like uh you know and i mean i have a lot of
seed too that i'm willing to trade in a so i mean there's certain things that you know we kind of
keep tight and then there's other things that you know so um yeah i mean it's it's not exclusive
like it's it's we want everybody to join join in you know so on that note i'd love to do a little
open source one-to-one uh breeding project with you guys and that's part of why i picked the name
yin yang it's just what goes around comes around and also just you know share share where you got
your genetics from share it back give them back the kudos and a thank you and let them run with
what you did with it that's my goal and there's a couple of groups that i donate to um one is
seedsforvets.org it's a really great organization just helping veterans out and i mostly donated
cbd seeds but my next goal is to stabilize a one-to-one to be able to have in seed form that
people can just get through ptsd and you know have medicinal outlets that can be open sourced
to where you know these genetics can get out there that's my goal i think that's all the goal you
know that you know it's all about open source genetics or you know i feel like it is you know
we're not going to get anywhere for just uh you know hoarding genetics for ourselves or we will
but you know i feel like you know generally you're made a fool of when you do it you know what i mean
like look at all these genetics like the white yeah the white gets out you know the cbdv i'm sure
it's going to get out you know people are going to start doing uh i'm sure seedless as well just
like organ cbd so i don't know like you know when you when you put these uh requirements on people
either you're going to sue them like monsanto or it's just going to be a laughing stock essentially
so i don't know like we're just placeholders in the industry you know and you know we're just
trying to do the best we can for the people that are around us you know what i mean so i don't know
this you know i don't know who these people are fooling with you know they're you know they're
mtas and you know whatever you know agreements and lawsuits and whatnot you know eventually this
stuff's going to get out unless you're monsanto and you have millions of dollars just to sue
everyone um you know it's it's all our property i guess from now and you know whether you like it
or not and i don't really like it you know not i don't like i said there's certain people i don't
like in the industry you know just because the way they treat others but uh yeah you know i think
we're all about open source genetics and that's why we're here you know is to provide genetics for
the people and also to help people so if you guys have you know any questions you ever want to
breathe you know you can reach out to us i'm sure all of us would talk to you and uh be your friend
essentially absolutely well that's my viewpoint is a lot of these genetics were here before i got
here and they're probably going to be here when i leave so they're not mine yeah i mean we're just
we're just stewards right of the plant i mean we're just yeah we're just taking care of it or
yeah or she's taking care of the same time i do want someone like clay to be able to benefit from
the work that he's put into it and not have somebody rip off his genetics so it's a fine
line but there's there's room for both there's room for people to get credit and to get sustenance
through what they've done the work that they put in and there's room for us to open source some
so yeah i agree with you floyd as far as if anybody does have things that they've worked on
that they'd like to include in an open source personal my personal goal will be a one-to-one
type open source to where you know to bring seeds or some of these people that are really open
sourcing and giving seeds away for free just to get people to grow this plant in your backyard
that can be medicinal in whatever degree you want thc dominant cbd dominant cbg whichever
the seed form to have a plant that you can grow yourself that's to me my goal and then
just to add on that i got a lot of really nice cuts i've been on it so i'll send you some cuts
if you want i just call it yeah i'll make a trip down there when you're gonna do your next seed
project i can just put them in overnight ups or something yeah right you make a trip down there
this post is ridiculous it looks like i don't know like it's like kind of like floyd's biscotti a
little bit not quite the turf but that same like you know girl scout cookie like purple nice push
look you know what i mean so nice nice and that's my goal with some of like the blue dreams that i
have that i already hit with abacus so then let's talk about a yielder it's a producer it's got all
the great turps that i personally like i know everyone hates on blue dream generally it's so
overbeaten but the real old dream is just it's it's a game changer as far as yield and that's
my other goal is to have production strains that can then be cannabinoid producers for people
to you know pop in their backyard and have have it be worthwhile like clay was saying that it's
it was selected for structure to yield for terpenes and for cannabinoids to check all
the boxes and bug resistance you know to not just be a polyhybrid that won't survive i want stuff
that can i can throw in the yard and it'll survive that's my personal goal too yeah that's uh
yeah and that's you know even bringing back a lot of these land races and crossing into you know
some of our hybrids or modern hybrids i mean right um yeah i mean we've lost a lot you know
and that's what i mean like you know if somebody was looking for minors like i would just i would
you know go straight to the land races like back in the land races yeah we we worked a bunch of
syrians you know last summer and out crossed them to a bunch of cbd and thc strains i think
clay's grown some of those out right now across into our one-to-one thcb um and yeah i mean it's
you know just the terpene profiles the bigger i mean you can you barely need to fertilize them
they just crush you know i mean they might need some work on some structure um you know bulking
them up but uh other than that man they're yeah they're yeah you'd be surprised what you can find
in some of these uh land races and heirlooms that um some of these seed banks um like irising
from the land race exchange ac is the real seed company um all these guys like yeah they're doing
they're doing awesome work just preserving and getting some of those genetics out there
so and you'd be surprised almost all of them are mixed chemotype so i mean you can find hemp
compliant varieties and land races if you want to so uh yep but yeah i love your blue dreams
that i haven't got a chance to grow it but you brought that little squat you know a little
plant to the noco expo lawrence and that thing was that thing was awesome the stem rub on it
was funky i mean i'm excited those are one of the ones i'm most excited to grow out it was a beast
it's a producer because abacus brought up the the vigor and the yield and uh it was a pretty nice
vigor and yield on its own the original cut yeah yeah i'm gonna be working that again i hit that
this year with uh been working a little bit with cult classics seeds um i like him as just as
his integrity as a breeder um and he kind of open sources in a way his own genetics meaning he's he
doesn't get butthurt if you breed with this stuff but i got a sour orange pucker from him that i
bred into that blue dreams that i'm thinking to release through daga and through you hoku
yeah there's there's a lot to be said for a production that can be a mixed ratio that's my
personal goal that it can be a production worthy strain that can be mixed cannabinoids
and blue dream is one of my favorites the other that i have is a flubber that i hit with scotts
og that just brought in a lot of that really nice triangle cush terpene profile it's almost like a
cognac it's got a couple of phenotypes but flubber just gave it that really nice backbone as a
yielder it's a monster yielder so i'm gonna be working with that to breed some mixed ratios into
it yeah that's my other focus is production strains they're just going to be monster yielders
oh yeah now i got it uh that cali crush that's just a beast man i'll send it to you but you'll
love it yeah awesome for sure yeah i have some flow back i call it it's flow that i hit with
abacus twice um really nice structure on the flow i'm a fan of flow as well you know it's one of
your one of your personal faves thomas but i get you some of those too i call it flow back to be a
little more capable of bringing it into a cbd dominant genetic yeah i'd run with it run with it
yeah let me know i'm just trying to get ready for the next seed run okay i've just uh i'm flowering
out right now 118 room and it's like three weeks into flower so i should pull down nine or ten
weeks probably and then i'll do another seed run after that sort of seven weeks okay i'll probably
hit it to the legendary that purple legendary og or legendary is a cbd dominant it's not legend
it smells like lemon poppy seed and hash i guess like nice okay what are the mushroom muffins
and hash i don't know who knows what it is because if you look up legendary og it's it
doesn't have any of those terpenes whatsoever it's supposed to be a lot more gassy you know
and this is like indica hash you know like almost like probably like the cbd cake or something
i don't know the phenotypes are all over the place the first seed that i got were really
lofty some roaming somewhere like green and dense and then the second seed that i got were a lot
better uh i found some like super huge green dense colas and then like like purple pine cone
shape colas that's what i'm going to run with but uh the original one had cbc in it so i've
not been able to test this one yet just because it was full of seed so i'll i'm going to run it
for flower and test it right now yeah you can have that one as well whatever you want to cross with
just make them backwards
throwing a little hype strain into some of these cbd cultivars just kind of throw it back into that
world i like doing that too right and that's uh that that's why i want to use the legendary you
know it's uh yeah i would say that ruby kush is almost better i'm not too sure but uh the
legendary is the hype you know i don't know it's all about you know you gotta give people what they
want but i'm sure it's a really good smoke that's what everyone says and that's what uh you know
the believers on the legendary cake and he's the one who really pushed me to grow the belief or the
legendary first but he loves that smoke so i guess i'll trust him and go with it you know what i mean
but how do you guys do you guys use testers at all like people to help you grow out stuff to
just see what you got or do you pretty much do it all yourself i try to ask the testers but
i don't know like people test it but you know they'll test it for their own you know benefit
it's hard to be like okay please send me a bud you know you have to stay on top of them or you
won't get you know i need like right or four six and eight and no one will ever do that you got me
hey man i need your testers i'm about to do a breeding project like wait are you testing are
you breathing it doesn't matter if you're breathing but like don't tell me you're testing
when you're breathing i don't know you know i mean right right i don't know what about you guys
i mean i mean the only yeah the only real way you're gonna know is you know test it yourself
i mean if it's your own gear if like you really you're really interested you really care if you're
if you're curious of what you know what you just made i mean you gotta grow it out yourself even
you know even other people's gear you know that's why i grow everybody's seeds that i sell you know
it's like i just got down with the run of all of uh clay's you know hemp varieties the duramax
cherry the gas station gouda they all crushed i had selections of them you know top of the
you know thomas's i ran all your pink panther chow and glow um so i mean i guess we kind of
test each other's gear in that way but but yeah like if i want to really know how something's
gonna perform i'm gonna i'm gonna test it myself i do i do send out seed packs though and like
every once in a while somebody will send me some pictures back and kind of review but
um generally those are like the one-to-ones people you know people want the you know the spicy stuff
so how about you clay i know dude clay's probably the biggest one clay probably plants more seeds
than all of us i saw his winter seed seed crop that uh what'd you sow those yeah i don't know
i don't really um yeah i grow a lot of like if you say it's the test because we're buddies
you know what i'm saying and that's because you know you legitimately get something back
uh i i'll do that as far as testers go but like how thomas is saying a lot of people are like oh
just give me that and i just want to rip it off the free seeds or run with it yeah whatever you
know but yeah and so um it's kind of like and like how floyd said if i want to know
my own stuff's good before i'm gonna give it out to somebody so they'd be like that stuff's crap
you know oh well whoops you know that's not cool so uh i wouldn't i hate when i get gear
it's like that but unless i'm expecting it you know and if i'm expecting it that's okay
i'll pop more so uh yeah you know um no no testers unless it's mainly myself or my close friends
that i know are gonna do something you know so yeah you were doing that field though clay right
of the was that that grain variety that went down to was it nine degrees at some point you're
doing some biochar am i remembering that right um the overwintering grain project yeah yep
that's freaking awesome man just FYI that's crazy yeah yeah i'll keep everybody posted on it i mean
the point of that is is that there's no water here there's no water anywhere and if you can get
a crop because hay and alfalfa because the hay alfalfa and potatoes are the three biggest
crops grown in my county and there's a lot of the farm here um thousands and thousands tens and
hundred hunt lots and it's a big predominant area for all that and we're getting it all it's been
nasty these last couple years and this next year i have a feeling it's going to get worse
and so the whole point of the overwintering fiber project is to be able to put something down
never water it ever and get a a crop from it um right not i don't know for grain production if
it's going to be worth anything at all because you know seed is water um really i'm only concerned
about the fiber because i can grow the seed in a different manner um basically doing like big
fem runs uh with my um land race hence my great grandfather grew back in world war one it's
been feral on my family farm do that feminize it which i have that project going now which is
has nothing to do with mixed ratios there's cool mixed ratios in it like floyd says if you want to
look at some crazy miners and crazy stuff yeah there's stuff in it but it's not chosen for any
of those factors it's chosen for grain and fiber factors so but yeah i mean i really hope it works
out if it does that'd be great for the world now if we just figure out something to do with it
you know it's like a dry farming yeah it's i have a really simple approach that i want to do with it
basically just taking bales you just bail it all up and then you put it in a big industrial chopper
and make stuff you know simple as that it's like i don't see all this decortication all this other
crap these guys post and all this stuff i'm like we're you're just back to like how the cbd industry
started you know and it's it's the cbd industry truthfully and honestly is still a mess right now
and that's why guys putting out niche medicines like you guys with your team shoes thomas
especially and all these other and you too floyd and things these these they're gonna be you know
what does matter in the future and i know you got your cbd shop on it so it's that's just i mean
yeah like thomas said monsanto is gonna try to take everything over with this stuff especially
how we have these things coming out the last couple of days with cbga and cbda it it's only
gonna make monsanto go harder but well that's us guys kind of project just in evidence products
you know it's still important so yeah well that's kind of where i'm coming from too it's like you
know biomass cbd at this point is just a precursor you know like you're seeing you know like it's
delta a delta 10 uh thco delta 9 all hemp derived you know delta 8 thcv delta 9 thcv
none of those are natural compounds as i mean you can find them in the plant but it's like
i'm about trying to get back to the basics and like you know at the genetic level and i've talked
to some of these extractors it's way easier to extract like you know a pure thcv strain rather
than you know converted in the lab a lot of times you don't know what byproducts are being created
that can't even be tested for yet with those products you know so it literally we we still
are in the wild west days of the hemp industry there's a lot of uh you know snake oil salesmen
out there and stuff and it's just um you know we've kind of seen the crash as far as like the
outdoor farming and i think you know some of you know like we're you know we're some of the last
guys standing i feel like the guys that have found a niche as far as like craft hemp you know
taking things indoors growing high quality hemp flower focusing on the legal cannabinoids that
are mixed ratios because let's be honest even like cbg and cbd are more powerful together than they
are on their own you know and cbd is it you know cbg is it's kind of become a mainstay but as far
as like the you know the genetics that are available it's really bottlenecked you know
i'd say 90 of them are just white knockoffs you know there's only a few you know different ones
out there um you know we've got like the you know the original bernabeu crosses we did we do have
our lacrima circles which are you know iterations of the white though we think you know we've taken
them in i think uh and kind of improved upon at least the original seeds we had then we have the
mad dog which is similar to you know the matterhorn um as far as like different terpene profiles and
still kind of fire you know it's kind of that hybrid you know so we have like the fibrous sativa
the hybrid and then you have that indica but they all need work like we're literally just at the
ground floor like we're a couple years into this and you know um the sky's the limit you know we
have you know as far as terpene profiles even in the hemp industry like we're getting there to where
you know we're finally getting new flavors but what's it taking us five six years um you know
and it's it's going to be people that are actually getting down and you know and it's going to be i
think a lot of times it's guys like us you know that just either breeding in greenhouses breeding
in our our garages um taking them in in different directions um you know i never thought i'd be part
of this kind of minor cannabinoid mixed ratio kind of you know revolution like i that i never
i just had an interest in it and i just died you know kind of head first i was like you know when
i heard about cbg a few years ago i was like well how do i get it you know so i just went down on a
rabbit hole into the internet and it was before the white was even released i found uh sensi break
in italy had those bernabéu seeds and i literally had to use google translate to translate their
website from italian and english um and then you know communicate different time zones and you know
it was like i literally paid i think like 25 bucks per seed you know for those seeds it was just
crazy you know but it was the only cbg genetics that i could find and that's what catapulted me
and it's brought me to this point but the only reason we're here is because we have a passion
for this plant you know like we don't the amount of money that we've wasted and the seeds that
we've grown out that we've just thrown in the garbage um you know and we've you know we've
managed to stay alive you know and so i think one thing that i can be said that can be said for
everybody here today is that we all have integrity and what we do we all try to be honest and
forthcoming with our lineages and we all try to give credit where credit's due um which you don't
really see a lot you know on the cannabis side of things you know i mean that's one thing that
i'm grateful about being part of the hemp community it is a lot of family farmers and it's a lot of
craft farmers and it's people that um are kind of approaching it from a more medicinal aspect you
know like i like to get stoned as as much as the next guy but it's like i also see the benefit in
this plant i love turning people onto the plant that you know have never tried cannabis um you
know like my father-in-law you know hadn't smoked weed tried cannabis his entire life and just
recently you know he's he's been turned on and and it you know it's a benefit you know it's just like
you know every everybody that i i've shared this plant with it's changed their lives you know i've
seen people with uh crone's disease you know for 16 years um come out of remission just from a cbg
tincture so it's like these are just some of the you know um rso like i've seen so many people
beat cancer with rso treatment um which i'm a huge proponent of and and it's like that's one
of my goals is to literally you know like i think we brought up is create a plant that's you know
maybe a one-to-one-to-one or something that you could literally just hand somebody hey grow this
grow this pack out process it you know using ethanol into some rso you know there's simple
recipes online ethanol safe you know we've been drinking it for ages and it's like you know like
you can make really high potency medicine in your home grown in your garden for next to nothing
you know and it's like and it can change your life and it's so like that's that's what keeps me going
you know and i mean i've lost a lot of money and like i'm thankful now to be in the position where
you know we're finally starting to pay bills and and i owe a lot to you know the the community and
and my supporters um so it's just you know i'm grateful to be here i'm grateful to have connections
with all four of you guys um because i i can say that i wouldn't even be here without you guys you
know as far as sharing genetics um you know thomas gave me a head you know a hand up early on and
even clay you know i mean just sharing genetics and kind of you know back and forth and like
my new fem cbd line that is coming out here in a couple months is using uh clay's remedy kush diesel
as a reversal you know and it's like uh like i said i didn't create that i just phenol hunted it and
found something that was mind-blowing and i was like you know what i want to hit everything with
it so it's just uh yeah no it's this is a good community to be a part of and and uh you know i
hope i hope this cannabinoid or this this uh this uh whatever we're doing here breeders forum
has uh been informative for a lot of you guys so um yeah that's the end of my rant but
yeah and i just wanted to say stay away from those other cannabinoids hhc thco hhc is made
with heavy metals they uh i'm not too sure how they do it's like a distillation process with
heavy metals and uh it's actually hexahydric cannabinoid so it's just like thc but it is uh
it's a saturated fat just like uh you know saturated fats you get in junk food so you
can imagine smoking a saturated fat probably super bad for your lungs especially laced with
heavy metals and the only one that's good is i guess hhc made from titanium and you have no clue
what they're made from because all these heavy metals lab labs like botanic or they're not even
testing for them because they don't have a protocol to test for these crazy heavy metals so
i would just stick to the regular cannabinoids at this point and if you want to get super high uh
mix some cbd and thc together but i know there's a lot of prohibition states but
yeah that's the problem prohibition i guess and just try to work through it but uh
like i said uh all these all these other cannabinoids it's kind of like a freak show
out there and that's what i realized is going to these shows is these shows aren't cbd shows
anymore they're freak shows you know there's hhc thco there's like all these you know strange
things going on and you know it's not like it used to be you know and i'm not sure if it's
you know it's not like it used to be you know and i think uh we're all natural here you know
it's like more traditional breeding and uh traditional growing so i don't know just uh
i wanted to put that out there but yeah that's a good point yeah trust the plant i don't trust a
lot of labs especially people that are just trying to make money on quote getting you high the legal
hives like you're kind of cheating the plant in my opinion and well and it's unfortunate because
a lot of people need this plant you know i mean they use it for medicine and so it's like
yeah i mean you know delta-8 and stuff i mean i've never tried it personally but i mean i
you know people are getting relief from it right so i mean it's it's a it's a tough one
is there anything you guys have as goals that i can help with as far as any mix ratio
thc stuff cbd stuff um yeah i'll just keep bringing your genetics in and just
them with uh you know cbd pollen donors and so we can make new terpene so i think that's what we
need is also new terpenes you know it's a lot of that's what i do now but we don't have anything
else you know even the cush it's nice but it's not there's no biscotti or anything you know all
right yeah that's my goal let one hit yeah we'll do some trading for sure go ahead clay sorry so
yeah i'd love to trade with you man i was just saying we'll do some trading for sure you know
get some stuff going trading between us sam i got a package i need to send thomas so
oh yeah but i'll send you one next week guys yeah dude all right clay man i want to say
keeping on to peter yeah right and uh thanks to everybody else and uh it was really fun
learned a lot good chatting with everybody okay yep hemp farmer clay genetics coming down coming
soon right yeah oh yeah i've been posting this gps farms but it's
yeah it's just so much easier for everybody to follow him farmer clay and it's every
everybody that's that's what we that's what we know you as man
right on yeah that's me everybody
you
keep going keep it on brother all right nice to meet you
you too thomas you too yeah you as well brother good to see you we'll talk soon
so uh just quickly london where are you uh lurking in the background so i got a run uh
if you guys want to wrap you can wrap if you want to keep going you can keep going you got
you're in the you're in the delicate tender hands of london right now okay
i'm good i gotta go i gotta get ready for the cannabis cup here with us
but yeah it's nice to talk to you but we we can always do it again i i love this i love i mean
uh like floyd i just as you know as you guys were talking i was thinking like
you know breeders all send me stuff for freebies to like give out to people when i send out packs
and like you you sent me that big ass you know like uh vial of like a couple thousand of of uh
this you know the mad dog cbg i'm looking at the can of fire cbd you sent me the sarian one and
it's awesome like i love you know and i hope if if people are watching if you want that stuff like i
i try to look what people are ordering if they're ordering stuff that's kind of in like the one-to-one
direction i'll be like try this stuff out um but uh no i i love kind of the open source
you know and the sharing and the trading and the just kind of what you guys are all about and it's
uh so yeah we'll we'll do some more conversations uh but that was fun to listen to as i was working
in the background you got to get these guys on dogga man they're all the media that you see
i'll get them i'll be doing releases so i got some new seeds for you coming down that's awesome
yeah and i'll and then you know but what we just talked about like send stuff that you want me to
get out there like i i have uh i don't know if he's listening right now but someone who has you
know certain ailments and was like this really helped me and he sent me just a bunch of stuff
and i'm starting to stick them and just get them out to people and vegetable seeds and you know i
didn't even order this but like oh my god i'm growing like healthy vegetables like i'm growing
low thc cool shit hey thomas got spilanthes seeds for you don't you have some spilanthes dude yeah
i'll send some but uh i spilanthes i haven't been sick in 13 years uh well except for food poisoning
but this uh herb it's called the toothache plant when you take it you know it numbs your mouth but
it's amazing so i got my whole family on it but i'll send you some seeds and i eat the flowers i
swear it's like helping my memory as well it's crazy that's awesome and uh i uh yeah i was i
was actually looking up like buck because we're talking about buckthorn yesterday and then uh
yeah i go down these rabbit holes like there's so many different you know we don't always have to
talk weed it's like oh yeah there's so many other interesting plants that like i'm exploring other
people are exploring it's uh it's fun they're fun rabbit holes to go down oh yeah aloe aloe
vera man that's one of my favorites and you can get all kinds of different seeds yeah well nice
to talk to you guys i'm out as well but with that we will call it floyd uh i i was do you remember
our last conversation i was uh i was like do i put in the effort to find my where's waldo uh
remember i put the where's waldo right over your uh on the on the kitchen uh cabinet above your
shoulder i'm sure people noticed it yeah oh yeah i've been is there ways that we can tap in and
comment too like yeah yeah no so what you can do is just open another tab and go to youtube
and then pause the video but keep the chat going because then you you don't hear like the double
echo uh that's what i do like i have the chat just like you can actually pop the chat out of
the window um okay see because i i would love to be able to answer some of those questions too
while everybody's talking i mean this is a good like this is the first time i've ever done anything
like this so um i think it went pretty secondly second second time yeah yeah excuse me second time
