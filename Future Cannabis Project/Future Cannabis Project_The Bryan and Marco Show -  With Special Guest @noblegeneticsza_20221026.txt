[00:01.080 --> 00:07.200]  What is up? Happy Wednesday to you, Living Soil nerds. We are coming live with Bob from
[00:07.200 --> 00:13.100]  South Africa. So we had just a couple of IT problems as usual. Setting up live stuff sometimes
[00:13.100 --> 00:18.240]  takes 15, 20 minutes. So shout out to Ken for always being there, setting up the things
[00:18.240 --> 00:21.760]  behind the scenes so that when we do have trouble, we're only like five, 10 minutes
[00:21.760 --> 00:24.560]  late for the show. So appreciate you, Ken.
[00:25.560 --> 00:30.960]  Bob, when I reach out to you, buddy, it's pretty cool, man, that Marco, myself, and
[00:30.960 --> 00:36.000]  I feel like Leighton, the guys that I do the show with and Ken, there's people that are
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.520]  willing to watch our shows now internationally. And when you first start doing this, you're
[00:42.520 --> 00:46.200]  kind of amazed that, I don't know, or at least I was kind of amazed that this little community
[00:46.200 --> 00:51.480]  started to exist and such bright-minded individuals. When I first was starting with Leighton and
[00:51.480 --> 00:55.800]  now we got Marco, who's not only bringing bright-minded concepts, but also has a little
[00:55.800 --> 01:01.400]  bit more of like how I grew up, just a little more of a grind to them. And so we're continuing
[01:01.400 --> 01:07.160]  to take that. And now, Marco, we know we're international today. And I'm excited to be
[01:07.160 --> 01:12.720]  able to talk to Bob because in real time, we want to help you understand branding. We
[01:12.720 --> 01:16.920]  want to kind of build things up. So I know that you have like some questions for us,
[01:16.920 --> 01:20.360]  Bob. I know the audience is going to be big into this because they have a lot of questions
[01:20.400 --> 01:25.880]  about what really goes on in South Africa. I learned when I was reaching out to you,
[01:25.880 --> 01:31.040]  trying to get your photo and communicating with you, that you have only certain times
[01:31.040 --> 01:36.880]  that electricity is on point where you don't really have to worry about that. Obviously,
[01:36.880 --> 01:41.360]  in America, we don't really worry about that kind of stuff. So again, America is such a
[01:41.360 --> 01:46.800]  beautiful country. She has a little bit of a tarnished tour sometimes. But I also don't
[01:46.800 --> 01:50.400]  have to think about those things in my daily life. So I kind of wanted to start with that,
[01:50.400 --> 01:56.560]  man, that our life is great, man. And to be able to talk to you in South Africa live,
[01:56.560 --> 02:00.800]  this is just something cool for me, man. I never really thought that we would be international
[02:00.800 --> 02:07.560]  anything. So yeah, I wanted to kick it off to Marco. Just kind of like just at all today,
[02:07.560 --> 02:13.560]  man, that we're able to do this in real time. We're a worldwide event, I guess, today.
[02:14.080 --> 02:20.680]  Yeah, man, that is cool. What's up, Bob? Good to meet you today. Nice to see you from South
[02:20.680 --> 02:24.680]  Africa. I think you've said what it's about 10.08 now? PM?
[02:24.680 --> 02:27.680]  Yeah, just past 10 now.
[02:27.680 --> 02:32.080]  Yeah, man, that's my bedtime. So appreciate you staying up with us. We're going to have
[02:32.080 --> 02:36.840]  a little ride here. And the cool thing is, you know, like Brian said, you know, when
[02:36.840 --> 02:41.080]  you have challenges, man, like in different areas, different countries, different regions,
[02:41.080 --> 02:45.480]  wherever you are, it's going to be cool to kind of talk about how natural farming ties
[02:45.480 --> 02:49.080]  into that too. Because, you know, I see that you're a natural farmer. I see that you're
[02:49.080 --> 02:54.000]  making a lot of inputs. And I see that you're growing a lot of microbes, you know. So I
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.360]  just like to get all into it, kind of learn a little bit about, you know, all the stuff
[02:58.360 --> 03:02.560]  you've been doing and, you know, what's your kind of, you know, the community like? How
[03:02.560 --> 03:07.480]  are the folks down there? Do you have a little group? And then, you know, kind of take it
[03:07.480 --> 03:13.360]  from there. Hopefully I didn't break up on you. It was kind of a long introduction, but
[03:13.360 --> 03:24.280]  tell us a little bit about yourself, Bob, and we'll get on into it, man. There we go.
[03:24.280 --> 03:25.280]  Can you hear us, Bob?
[03:25.280 --> 03:33.480]  Yeah, he's just getting his stuff together.
[03:33.480 --> 03:36.600]  Yeah. And this is kind of the issues that we were having before, you know, the video
[03:36.600 --> 03:40.600]  is working, but the audio wasn't working. Can you hear us, Bob?
[03:46.840 --> 03:47.440]  He can't.
[03:47.440 --> 03:48.880]  It looks like he can't hear you.
[03:48.880 --> 03:52.480]  Yeah, we cannot hear you. So, yeah, man.
[03:52.480 --> 03:54.440]  How about leave and come back?
[03:54.440 --> 03:55.040]  Yep.
[03:55.040 --> 03:56.040]  There we go.
[03:57.600 --> 04:01.240]  So as you guys can see, that's, you know, behind the scenes, that's the kind of stuff
[04:01.240 --> 04:04.800]  that we're dealing with before we go live. That's why if you do see us late, that's what
[04:04.800 --> 04:09.600]  we're dealing with. But we're trying, you know, as best we can to bring you guys just
[04:09.600 --> 04:15.400]  a variety of different people. And sometimes, obviously, you know, IT problems exist with
[04:15.440 --> 04:16.440]  that.
[04:20.070 --> 04:26.710]  It's, you know, the fact that he that we, you know, the ability that the Internet and
[04:26.710 --> 04:31.870]  the electricity works within this time frame is pretty unique as well, Marco.
[04:32.390 --> 04:36.350]  He was telling me, like, if the show was any earlier, like if, you know, it was it was
[04:36.350 --> 04:39.430]  tomorrow or something like that, he wouldn't be 100 percent sure that he would have the
[04:39.910 --> 04:41.790]  electricity to even do the show.
[04:42.230 --> 04:47.510]  So like from your daily routine, you know, I mean, that's it was kind of wild to me,
[04:47.510 --> 04:50.390]  man, you know, to really think things through like, oh, I got to do these things.
[04:50.390 --> 04:54.670]  Why electricity is on, you know, probably hot showers, like all the little things we
[04:54.670 --> 04:59.830]  take advantage or take for for the fact that like we have them, it's an advantage in
[04:59.830 --> 05:03.630]  life. Other people all over the world don't even have hot showers.
[05:03.870 --> 05:06.110]  So it just had me on my mind thinking a lot today.
[05:06.470 --> 05:08.790]  Just how grateful, you know.
[05:10.070 --> 05:14.750]  Even farming cannabis and all the stuff that came with it, we never had to worry about
[05:14.750 --> 05:20.870]  some of those in my view, maybe even trivial things that we kind of take for granted
[05:21.670 --> 05:26.670]  is a daily on the mind, on the conscious brain, not even in the subconscious.
[05:26.950 --> 05:32.070]  I got to get this stuff done before the power goes off or I need to get this stuff on in a
[05:32.070 --> 05:34.950]  few hours. My life doesn't work like that.
[05:34.950 --> 05:36.630]  Now, you know, your life doesn't work like that.
[05:36.630 --> 05:38.670]  So it's just kind of eye opening, man.
[05:39.110 --> 05:40.270]  Yeah, definitely.
[05:40.270 --> 05:42.430]  Definitely. Looks like we got Bob back.
[05:42.630 --> 05:44.150]  At least I can see you now.
[05:44.430 --> 05:46.870]  Can you hear me?
[05:46.870 --> 05:48.830]  Fine. I've moved to another phone.
[05:48.830 --> 05:49.670]  I'm over in the market.
[05:49.670 --> 05:50.550]  That's a bit of luck.
[05:51.510 --> 05:52.510]  We can't hear you.
[05:52.790 --> 05:55.150]  Maybe turn the volume down a little bit.
[05:55.150 --> 05:56.190]  We're hearing it back.
[05:57.310 --> 06:01.510]  Yeah, you've got something turned on in the background that we're getting an echo from.
[06:05.650 --> 06:08.170]  Yeah, but man, you got to think, man, it's a long way.
[06:08.970 --> 06:15.970]  Do you have another device turned on to the stream, Bob, in the background because we're
[06:15.970 --> 06:18.330]  getting it an echo through something else?
[06:20.930 --> 06:22.930]  Yeah, I've turned off the other device.
[06:22.930 --> 06:27.950]  Let me see if I put headphones into this phone.
[06:27.950 --> 06:28.950]  If it works.
[06:32.950 --> 06:33.950]  Can you hear us?
[06:33.950 --> 06:34.950]  Is that a bit better?
[06:34.950 --> 06:37.410]  That is.
[06:37.410 --> 06:38.410]  Yeah, that's a bit better.
[06:38.410 --> 06:39.410]  Yeah.
[06:39.690 --> 06:40.690]  Is that a bit better?
[06:40.690 --> 06:41.690]  Yeah.
[06:41.690 --> 06:42.690]  That is.
[06:42.690 --> 06:44.690]  If you can hear us, can you hear what we're saying?
[06:45.690 --> 06:46.690]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[06:47.690 --> 06:48.690]  Okay, good.
[06:48.690 --> 06:49.690]  Perfect.
[06:50.690 --> 06:51.690]  All right.
[06:51.690 --> 06:54.690]  So, you know, we're kind of kicking this off while you're having problems there, Bob.
[06:54.690 --> 06:57.690]  And I just wanted to kind of highlight that.
[06:57.690 --> 07:01.690]  Slow, but I think that's just the internet catching up a little bit.
[07:02.690 --> 07:04.690]  I thought you guys can hear me fine.
[07:04.970 --> 07:09.970]  Yeah, I've had to deal with this before, so we'll kind of get used to the lag here.
[07:09.970 --> 07:14.970]  So I'll ask a question, I'll kind of wait and then hopefully, you know, that'll all
[07:14.970 --> 07:16.970]  come through and then you can hear that.
[07:16.970 --> 07:20.970]  With the problems that we're having, I wanted to kind of kick it off that you have to plan
[07:20.970 --> 07:23.970]  your day by not having electricity 24-7.
[07:23.970 --> 07:26.970]  So do you mind telling us what life is like that as a farmer?
[07:29.370 --> 07:30.370]  Tricky, man.
[07:30.650 --> 07:36.650]  Everything from genetics to growing to couriering parcels, you have to plan it out according
[07:36.650 --> 07:37.650]  to the schedules.
[07:40.650 --> 07:47.440]  We can't hear you, Bob.
[07:49.440 --> 07:51.440]  Now we can't hear you.
[07:52.440 --> 07:58.340]  And there he goes again.
[07:58.340 --> 08:03.340]  Well, maybe when he comes back on, if he has the headset plugged into the device, maybe
[08:03.340 --> 08:05.340]  we'll get a better stream.
[08:05.340 --> 08:07.340]  We'll just have to see what happens, guys.
[08:07.620 --> 08:11.620]  Well, he's more patient than me because I'd be snapping right now.
[08:13.620 --> 08:16.620]  No, but man, like you said, you know, challenges, man.
[08:16.620 --> 08:17.620]  Think about it.
[08:17.620 --> 08:21.620]  Even if you're just running a piece of equipment on electricity.
[08:21.620 --> 08:22.620]  Here we go.
[08:23.620 --> 08:25.620]  I've killed the camera.
[08:25.620 --> 08:28.620]  I just want to see if this will work a bit better.
[08:29.620 --> 08:30.620]  Actually, yes, we can hear you.
[08:30.620 --> 08:33.620]  At least on mine, I can hear you a lot better that way.
[08:34.620 --> 08:36.620]  Oh, yeah, he sounded good there.
[08:37.620 --> 08:38.620]  All right.
[08:38.620 --> 08:39.620]  Yeah, let's run it that way.
[08:39.620 --> 08:41.620]  Can you hear us now, Bob?
[08:43.620 --> 08:45.620]  Well, he didn't come back yet.
[08:45.620 --> 08:47.620]  He's his little bubble isn't back.
[08:49.620 --> 08:50.620]  We'll let him get it.
[08:50.620 --> 08:51.620]  Get it.
[08:51.620 --> 08:52.620]  Get through.
[08:52.620 --> 08:54.620]  You have a rolling blackout that people don't know what that is.
[08:54.620 --> 08:58.620]  You know, they they they cut your they don't have enough electricity.
[08:58.620 --> 09:03.620]  So they kind of cut your electricity off at certain times so that you don't have it for
[09:03.620 --> 09:04.620]  a while.
[09:04.620 --> 09:05.620]  Then your neighbor will get it for a while.
[09:05.900 --> 09:07.900]  And, you know, you hear us, Bob.
[09:07.900 --> 09:09.900]  Yeah, I can hear you guys fine.
[09:09.900 --> 09:11.900]  Can you guys hear me fine without the video?
[09:12.900 --> 09:13.900]  Yes.
[09:13.900 --> 09:14.900]  Yeah, perfect.
[09:15.900 --> 09:17.900]  So, yeah, man, the load shedding can be fun.
[09:18.900 --> 09:21.900]  I guess our government supplied power.
[09:21.900 --> 09:25.900]  They didn't plan or they've not done enough maintenance on the power plants.
[09:26.900 --> 09:28.900]  So they load shed different sections.
[09:29.900 --> 09:33.900]  And depending on the stage, it can cut anywhere from once to three times a day
[09:33.900 --> 09:34.900]  for two to three hours.
[09:35.900 --> 09:38.900]  So you have to really plan everything.
[09:39.900 --> 09:40.900]  Yeah.
[09:40.900 --> 09:44.900]  So when you're like growing veg and growing out and you want the longer days
[09:44.900 --> 09:47.900]  and then, you know, you're flowering out things and you have those flickers and
[09:47.900 --> 09:48.900]  all that kind of stuff.
[09:48.900 --> 09:53.900]  Is that is that a constant worry as a as a farmer in South Africa?
[09:54.900 --> 09:57.900]  Definitely, you know, your genetics play a large role.
[09:58.900 --> 10:02.900]  People have different methods of solving the problem.
[10:03.180 --> 10:05.180]  Everyone's got their own little load shedding techniques.
[10:06.180 --> 10:08.180]  And I guess it's a problem not many other growers have to deal with
[10:08.180 --> 10:09.180]  internationally.
[10:09.180 --> 10:13.180]  But with everything from inverters with just low powered LEDs to keep the
[10:14.180 --> 10:15.180]  plants awake in veg.
[10:16.180 --> 10:20.180]  I like these small LED panels that come with a solar panel on it.
[10:21.180 --> 10:24.180]  So whenever the power cuts during veg, I'll go and hang that in the tent
[10:25.180 --> 10:26.180]  if need be.
[10:27.180 --> 10:30.180]  It's quite stressful during flowering times and people often ask what I do
[10:30.460 --> 10:31.460]  to help it.
[10:31.460 --> 10:34.460]  And, you know, I just hope and pray and you hope the genetics don't hurt me
[10:34.460 --> 10:35.460]  on you.
[10:38.460 --> 10:44.460]  And so are you able to have like gorilla grows outdoors or is it too wild
[10:44.460 --> 10:45.460]  to do that?
[10:45.460 --> 10:46.460]  You need to have things indoors.
[10:48.460 --> 10:53.460]  You can grow outdoors and with the legality at the moment, it's quite a
[10:53.460 --> 10:55.460]  gray area because they have not defined anything.
[10:55.740 --> 11:00.740]  So with certain loopholes and if you want to stretch definitions, it's
[11:00.740 --> 11:01.740]  legal to grow here.
[11:02.740 --> 11:05.740]  So for private and personal consumption, you're allowed to do anything
[11:06.740 --> 11:07.740]  within your private space.
[11:08.740 --> 11:11.740]  So as long as you can justify the number of plants or the space you're
[11:12.740 --> 11:14.740]  growing in for personal use, it's technically legal.
[11:16.740 --> 11:20.740]  A lot of people have gone through the loophole of private social clubs.
[11:21.020 --> 11:25.020]  So if you're not able to grow, you sign over your growing permission,
[11:26.020 --> 11:27.020]  so to say, to someone else.
[11:28.020 --> 11:30.020]  But that was recently deemed illegal.
[11:31.020 --> 11:34.020]  So there was a protest and we're busy dealing with all of that.
[11:35.020 --> 11:38.020]  But there are a lot of people that grow some really great outdoor.
[11:39.020 --> 11:40.020]  We've got an amazing sun and climate.
[11:41.020 --> 11:44.020]  Depending on the area, you can sometimes have issues with neighbors.
[11:45.020 --> 11:48.020]  Where I'm at, it's pretty much free rain.
[11:48.300 --> 11:51.300]  I can plant as much as I like, but I don't have enough soil to do that
[11:52.300 --> 11:53.300]  decently.
[11:53.300 --> 11:54.300]  The soil locally isn't the best.
[11:55.300 --> 11:56.300]  And what is the soil like there?
[11:57.300 --> 12:01.760]  What is the native soil kind of comprised of there?
[12:02.760 --> 12:05.760]  I wouldn't be able to define it too much, but it's rock hard.
[12:06.760 --> 12:07.760]  Rocky.
[12:08.760 --> 12:09.760]  It's dirt, sand, clay vibes.
[12:10.760 --> 12:12.760]  OK, you definitely don't want to be digging.
[12:13.760 --> 12:16.760]  And we've got all sorts of different types of soil.
[12:17.040 --> 12:20.040]  And we've got all sorts of climates over the country.
[12:21.040 --> 12:25.040]  Just where I'm at, it's sort of northern, northern in the country.
[12:26.040 --> 12:30.040]  Midlands, northern area, just above Joburg, Pretoria.
[12:31.040 --> 12:33.040]  So there we quite dry out here.
[12:34.040 --> 12:35.040]  So the land's not so conducive.
[12:36.040 --> 12:39.040]  You've got to prep it a little bit if you want to grow some good ganja.
[12:40.040 --> 12:43.040]  So probably some parts are similar to some parts of California, then maybe.
[12:43.320 --> 12:46.320]  If people said that or if they compared it to any other regions.
[12:47.320 --> 12:48.320]  Just curious.
[12:49.320 --> 12:53.320]  I've not personally had too much experience with other growers that have been to other regions.
[12:54.320 --> 12:55.320]  So I'm not too sure.
[12:56.320 --> 12:59.320]  We do have areas down at the coast that are extremely tropical.
[13:00.320 --> 13:05.320]  So great for veg, but you really have to hone your skills in when you're flowering with all the PM.
[13:06.320 --> 13:08.320]  I know of many people that have lost all crops.
[13:09.320 --> 13:11.320]  So where I'm at, it's quite a lot drier.
[13:11.600 --> 13:15.600]  But down at the coast, we've got quite a few climates across the land.
[13:16.600 --> 13:20.600]  So you just got to pick which you'd rather tackle and what you want to hunt for.
[13:21.600 --> 13:22.600]  Mm hmm. Definitely.
[13:24.600 --> 13:29.600]  So when you're getting into this kind of stuff, are you are you trying genetics with your peer group?
[13:30.600 --> 13:33.600]  Are you ordering things online and they're coming to you in T-shirts and hats and stuff?
[13:34.600 --> 13:37.600]  How are you getting these genetics to start things off?
[13:37.880 --> 13:45.880]  Back when I first started growing quite not too long ago, I'm still quite a newbie, but probably about 2017.
[13:46.880 --> 13:48.880]  It wasn't so legal.
[13:49.880 --> 13:51.880]  So the only seed bank was one called Green Smoke Room Seeds.
[13:52.880 --> 13:54.880]  But as far as I was aware, they were drop shipping seeds.
[13:55.880 --> 13:58.880]  So you'd order from them and they'd order from somewhere internationally.
[13:59.880 --> 14:02.880]  So I ordered from a website called Amsterdam Marijuana Seeds.
[14:03.160 --> 14:06.160]  And I've got a few different seeds just to grow out.
[14:07.160 --> 14:09.160]  And back then I wasn't too interested in the breeding.
[14:10.160 --> 14:12.160]  I always said I'll learn to grow really well.
[14:13.160 --> 14:14.160]  Other people can do well at the breeding.
[14:15.160 --> 14:20.160]  But that bug bit really hard when I got a good male, probably end of 2019.
[14:21.160 --> 14:23.160]  And I decided to really go down the genetic rabbit hole.
[14:24.160 --> 14:26.160]  You know, I always thought I'll buy bulk cheap seeds.
[14:27.160 --> 14:29.160]  I'll get some good flower out and it'll do the job.
[14:30.160 --> 14:32.160]  But when I went down the rabbit hole, I started to see a lot of bugs.
[14:33.160 --> 14:37.160]  And I started learning, you know, there's value to true genetics and well bred genetics.
[14:38.160 --> 14:39.160]  So I've done everything.
[14:40.160 --> 14:42.160]  I've bought some stuff recently from a breeder in America.
[14:43.160 --> 14:47.160]  It was Runtz Cross East Coast Grateful Breath and GMO Cross Synchronicity.
[14:48.160 --> 14:50.160]  So that's some stuff from across the ocean.
[14:51.160 --> 14:55.160]  Most of our genetics locally, I would say, originate in Cali.
[14:56.160 --> 15:01.160]  Like the influence you guys have had is quite ridiculous, I think, internationally.
[15:01.440 --> 15:03.440]  But there are some really good local growers.
[15:04.440 --> 15:10.440]  Some of the stuff I really have used as a foundation point in my breeding is from a breeder named Jay.
[15:11.440 --> 15:12.440]  He started a brand called Amma Deadly.
[15:13.440 --> 15:18.440]  And they've done a lot of great work in the country for many years.
[15:19.440 --> 15:21.440]  And then I guess we've always got that Durban Poison.
[15:22.440 --> 15:28.440]  I've got a F-16 Durban Poison that's from another OG.
[15:29.440 --> 15:30.440]  Sorry.
[15:31.440 --> 15:32.440]  Let me stop you. Sorry, Bob.
[15:33.440 --> 15:35.440]  Can you spell the name of Amma Deadly?
[15:38.440 --> 15:42.440]  The local grower, the breeder, if he's got a website, what's his name?
[15:43.440 --> 15:44.440]  I didn't catch it.
[15:52.670 --> 15:53.670]  You there, Bob?
[15:57.450 --> 15:58.450]  Ken, did he fall off?
[15:59.450 --> 16:00.450]  He might have fell off.
[16:01.450 --> 16:03.450]  He's still in the bottom here.
[16:04.450 --> 16:05.450]  So I'm not sure what happened to him.
[16:06.450 --> 16:07.450]  He should be hearing us.
[16:08.450 --> 16:09.450]  We didn't hear you.
[16:09.730 --> 16:11.730]  I'm just trying to note that breeder, that local breeder.
[16:12.730 --> 16:13.730]  I like to take note of stuff like that, man.
[16:14.730 --> 16:16.730]  If somebody reach out to make contact.
[16:17.730 --> 16:18.730]  He did jump off again.
[16:19.730 --> 16:20.730]  So we'll have to wait for him to come back on.
[16:21.730 --> 16:22.730]  Might have said some shit triggered over there.
[16:23.730 --> 16:27.730]  No, he did say that he's like, man, this might be something.
[16:28.730 --> 16:29.730]  I was like, you know what?
[16:30.730 --> 16:31.730]  Our audience is pretty patient.
[16:32.730 --> 16:34.730]  The fact that we can get this in real time from somebody that's learning.
[16:35.730 --> 16:37.730]  And Marco is like a fan of the show.
[16:38.010 --> 16:40.010]  So that's why I wanted to reach out to him.
[16:41.010 --> 16:43.010]  Because there's so much to learn from each other.
[16:44.010 --> 16:45.010]  He needs kind of our experience.
[16:46.010 --> 16:49.010]  And then we kind of get to learn his world and his worldview.
[16:50.010 --> 16:51.010]  That's what I like to learn from.
[16:52.010 --> 16:54.010]  And hopefully I can expand our worldview.
[16:55.010 --> 16:56.010]  Talking about my personal, you know.
[16:57.010 --> 16:58.010]  Can you hear us, Bob?
[16:59.010 --> 17:00.010]  No doubt, man.
[17:01.010 --> 17:02.010]  Are you there, Bob?
[17:03.010 --> 17:04.010]  Okay, we can hear you as well.
[17:05.010 --> 17:06.010]  I can hear you guys.
[17:06.290 --> 17:07.290]  All right, Bob.
[17:08.290 --> 17:09.290]  I cut you off, man.
[17:10.290 --> 17:11.290]  Exactly.
[17:12.290 --> 17:13.290]  And I was actually cutting you off too.
[17:14.290 --> 17:17.290]  But I wanted to stop you because you said something about a breeder.
[17:18.290 --> 17:19.290]  And that was a local guy.
[17:20.290 --> 17:21.290]  Started with an A.
[17:22.290 --> 17:23.290]  And I just wanted to write it down and take a note of that.
[17:24.290 --> 17:27.720]  Yeah, I'm a daddy.
[17:29.720 --> 17:34.420]  It's I'm a daddy.
[17:37.420 --> 17:41.460]  Yeah, your sound is cutting in and out, Bob.
[17:42.460 --> 17:43.460]  That was amadade.
[17:44.460 --> 17:45.460]  I think so.
[17:47.460 --> 17:48.460]  You could also.
[17:49.460 --> 17:50.460]  You could type that privately to us.
[17:51.460 --> 17:54.460]  And then I guess we can say it that way.
[17:55.460 --> 17:56.460]  That'd be easier.
[17:57.460 --> 17:58.460]  Just on the chat right here.
[17:59.460 --> 18:02.460]  Yeah, Bob, if you can see the chat on the right hand side, you'll see private chat.
[18:03.460 --> 18:09.460]  You can type the name in there and then I can bring it up onto the stream and put it up for the people.
[18:10.460 --> 18:13.460]  Especially since that person, you know, he did mention he's doing big ones.
[18:14.460 --> 18:15.460]  Big things for the country.
[18:16.460 --> 18:17.460]  You know, I like those things or, you know, I hear those things and they make.
[18:18.460 --> 18:19.460]  OK, that sounds like a good guy.
[18:20.460 --> 18:22.460]  Others may want to be connected to him even where he lives.
[18:23.460 --> 18:26.460]  So definitely worth noting that for locals.
[18:32.720 --> 18:33.720]  Are you are you hearing us currently, Bob?
[18:39.720 --> 18:40.720]  Mother Comfrey said I'm a deadly.
[18:41.720 --> 18:43.720]  I can hear you guys and I'm busy typing.
[18:44.720 --> 18:45.720]  The phone's just glitching a little bit.
[18:46.720 --> 18:47.720]  OK, yeah, no.
[18:48.000 --> 18:49.000]  OK, actually, I think we've got it.
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  It's somebody else's old board.
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  Put it up and make sure it's the right.
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.000]  Yeah.
[18:59.000 --> 19:00.000]  Yeah.
[19:01.000 --> 19:02.000]  That is pretty cool that somebody else even knows about all that stuff.
[19:03.000 --> 19:04.000]  So, yeah, that's what this show is really about today, man.
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.000]  Trying to learn about others culture and also helping an individual that wants to be an entrepreneur.
[19:11.000 --> 19:16.000]  I know Mark and I have been talking about that lately and it's ringing true for a lot of individuals.
[19:16.280 --> 19:26.280]  Other people are like we had mentioned before, like shout out to Ryan, you know, somebody that literally quit his job and is now pursuing something that he loves because of this show.
[19:27.280 --> 19:37.280]  So, yeah, you know, we're talking here, you know, I think the easiest spot would be to just kind of let you talk for a while, Bob, and then we'll kind of get these questions in as as we can.
[19:38.280 --> 19:39.280]  Good point.
[19:44.810 --> 19:45.810]  Did you hear that?
[19:46.810 --> 19:47.810]  Do you hear that part?
[19:48.810 --> 19:49.810]  He might have a lag.
[19:52.660 --> 19:53.660]  Yeah, I heard.
[19:56.660 --> 19:57.660]  I heard you guys.
[19:58.660 --> 19:59.660]  It's just.
[20:10.140 --> 20:11.140]  Damn, this is frustrating.
[20:12.140 --> 20:13.140]  I didn't think it would be like this bad.
[20:14.140 --> 20:15.140]  Yeah, I know.
[20:15.140 --> 20:16.140]  A couple of times.
[20:17.140 --> 20:18.140]  Yeah.
[20:18.140 --> 20:19.140]  Shout out to the people that did know that I'm a deadly.
[20:20.140 --> 20:21.140]  That's a that's a sweet name.
[20:22.140 --> 20:23.140]  And then link to Bushman and stuff like that.
[20:24.140 --> 20:25.140]  Nice.
[20:26.140 --> 20:27.140]  Mother country shouted it out.
[20:27.420 --> 20:28.420]  Yeah, man, that just challenges.
[20:29.420 --> 20:30.420]  No doubt.
[20:31.420 --> 20:32.420]  I can understand it.
[20:33.420 --> 20:34.420]  Don't even stress.
[20:35.420 --> 20:36.420]  It's all good.
[20:37.420 --> 20:38.420]  Figure it out.
[20:39.420 --> 20:40.420]  Yeah, there's no use stressing about it.
[20:41.420 --> 20:42.420]  It is what it is.
[20:43.420 --> 20:44.420]  And hopefully we can get a good signal and get at least the voice back in.
[20:45.420 --> 20:46.420]  Mm hmm.
[20:47.420 --> 20:48.420]  Yeah, man.
[20:49.420 --> 20:55.420]  Can you imagine, though, Brian, you're trying to, you know, flower, you're trying to be, you know, tight on your grow and you got to deal with the things that you're doing.
[20:55.700 --> 20:58.700]  You're trying to be tight on your grow and you got to deal with two, three hour rolling blackout.
[20:59.700 --> 21:01.700]  I wonder if it's random, you know, randomly, too.
[21:02.700 --> 21:05.700]  That's what he had going back beforehand before the show.
[21:06.700 --> 21:07.700]  That's kind of what he was getting at.
[21:08.700 --> 21:13.700]  And like we had mentioned before, like the bubble guts, it's the unknown that really bothers you when you're in this game.
[21:14.700 --> 21:19.700]  It's it's somebody that you've you've, quote unquote, trust that you're doing business with.
[21:20.700 --> 21:21.700]  But at the same time, you don't really trust each other.
[21:22.700 --> 21:24.700]  And so you never really know what's going to happen on that.
[21:25.700 --> 21:26.700]  So that's all of that other stuff.
[21:27.700 --> 21:31.700]  Once you've actually got the flower, it's ready to go is all that uncertainty.
[21:32.700 --> 21:40.700]  And then it's usually you're pretty certain within your own house and your own grow and all your skill set of, you know, you know where you're at and hopefully where you're heading.
[21:41.700 --> 21:42.700]  Are you back, Bob?
[21:45.700 --> 21:46.700]  I am back.
[21:47.700 --> 21:48.700]  Let's just hope this audio stays true.
[21:49.700 --> 21:51.700]  Otherwise, I'm going to go over to my mobile data.
[21:51.980 --> 21:56.980]  OK, well, just start talking and the guys will try to get questions in as we go here.
[21:57.980 --> 22:00.980]  But you just you just start talking, brother.
[22:02.980 --> 22:03.980]  Sweet, man.
[22:04.980 --> 22:06.980]  So so yeah, that great I was talking about is I'm a deadly.
[22:07.980 --> 22:08.980]  It's Bushman Jay.
[22:09.980 --> 22:14.980]  He's he's been one of the OGs in the country for as long as I've been in the game.
[22:15.260 --> 22:16.260]  And then that.
[22:17.260 --> 22:20.260]  So he really, I would say, is the best of the best.
[22:22.260 --> 22:37.350]  When I come start to do in the genetics thing, I was actually like tripping on mushrooms and I messaged him and I was just explaining how beautiful his pictures was.
[22:38.350 --> 22:42.350]  Look, you know, he's got the most up reading program as I go forward.
[22:42.630 --> 22:44.630]  I landed up getting three different lines from him.
[22:45.630 --> 22:47.630]  The one was an alley Afi cross lemon cheesecake.
[22:48.630 --> 22:51.630]  The alley Afi was a S1 that he got from Canaventure back in the day.
[22:52.630 --> 22:57.630]  And then the lemon cheesecake was a super lemon haze crossed with a suicide cheese IBL.
[22:58.630 --> 23:02.630]  So I've done F2s of those and I hit them to a few.
[23:03.630 --> 23:04.630]  And then I hit them to a few.
[23:05.630 --> 23:06.630]  And then I hit them to a few.
[23:07.630 --> 23:08.630]  And then I hit them to a few.
[23:08.910 --> 23:15.910]  So I've done F2s of those and I hit them to a few of my favorite ladies that I had collected over the time.
[23:16.910 --> 23:26.910]  And what the idea is now is to line breed those various polyhybrid crosses and over the next few years, hopefully create some solid IBLs.
[23:27.910 --> 23:35.910]  Because I looked into how most plants were bred and like, I mean, we've not learned much in breeding since the 60s.
[23:36.190 --> 23:44.190]  So I just wanted to follow some normal agriculture and do some true line breeding and then create some vigorous F1s down the line.
[23:45.190 --> 23:47.190]  Because I don't feel that's done enough.
[23:48.190 --> 23:52.190]  There's been too much polyhybrid breeding and it has its place in the clone market.
[23:53.190 --> 23:58.190]  I feel the line breeding and creating truly stable crosses.
[23:59.190 --> 24:04.190]  I don't think has been done too much in the industry due to various reasons.
[24:04.470 --> 24:09.470]  But with legality coming over, I think it's time to do some decent breeding.
[24:11.470 --> 24:12.470]  Definitely smart.
[24:13.470 --> 24:14.470]  Good approach.
[24:15.470 --> 24:18.470]  Too many just take that one clone and run with it.
[24:21.470 --> 24:22.470]  Yeah, man.
[24:23.470 --> 24:24.470]  And it's easy to have a library of females.
[24:25.470 --> 24:29.470]  And every time you get a new pack to take a male and hit it to all those females.
[24:29.750 --> 24:34.750]  Whether you know it's fire or not, it's not truly breeding.
[24:35.750 --> 24:36.750]  It's more just seed production.
[24:38.750 --> 24:41.750]  And that has its place and it's a beautiful thing, you know.
[24:42.750 --> 24:45.750]  But I was thinking more bigger picture, longer term.
[24:46.750 --> 24:53.750]  But then I came into an issue where while I'm working on these various lines, you know, it's a 5-10 year game.
[24:54.750 --> 24:57.750]  People were enjoying the test packs I had sent out.
[24:58.030 --> 25:00.030]  And were asking to purchase them.
[25:01.030 --> 25:04.030]  So I had that urging on me while I'm just struggling to pay bills.
[25:05.030 --> 25:09.030]  But while also sitting there thinking these aren't market ready, you know.
[25:10.030 --> 25:16.030]  When I pop my own seeds, I find instabilities that I would really hate to happen in a large scale group grow.
[25:17.030 --> 25:22.030]  Too many people find hermaphrodites or intersexual plants to be the norm.
[25:23.030 --> 25:26.030]  And I feel like it's almost becoming accepted in our breeding.
[25:26.310 --> 25:29.310]  So I wanted to sort of work against that.
[25:30.310 --> 25:31.310]  I want to create some solid stable lines.
[25:32.310 --> 25:33.310]  You know the power cut one.
[25:34.310 --> 25:37.310]  So twice while you're flowering.
[25:38.310 --> 25:40.310]  You won't land up with a seeded crop.
[25:41.310 --> 25:42.310]  But then I created the membership.
[25:43.310 --> 25:45.310]  That people while I'm working towards something.
[25:46.310 --> 25:47.310]  Sort of like a Patreon.
[25:48.310 --> 25:53.310]  People can support me and then get the packs while I'm working towards market ready packs.
[25:53.590 --> 25:56.590]  And then that sort of it got some good attention.
[25:57.590 --> 25:59.590]  But learnt about the FT technology.
[26:00.590 --> 26:02.590]  And how I could include that technology with my membership.
[26:03.590 --> 26:08.590]  So I can give the people that share with the brand and invest in the brand.
[26:09.590 --> 26:12.590]  I can give them shares of the company.
[26:13.590 --> 26:17.590]  As well as access to the genetics while I work towards market stable stuff.
[26:17.870 --> 26:18.870]  Can you guys still hear me?
[26:19.870 --> 26:20.870]  I'm just rambling.
[26:21.870 --> 26:22.870]  Absolutely.
[26:22.870 --> 26:26.870]  And you're talking bars in a way that a lot of us only learn through experience.
[26:27.870 --> 26:29.870]  And the fact that most of the stuff is polyhybrid.
[26:30.870 --> 26:32.870]  A lot of that stuff is super watered down.
[26:33.870 --> 26:36.870]  And the reality is that only a certain percentage of the breeders.
[26:37.870 --> 26:38.870]  At least here in America.
[26:39.870 --> 26:40.870]  Especially some of the smaller breeders.
[26:41.870 --> 26:42.870]  They're not really interested in the technology.
[26:43.870 --> 26:44.870]  They're not really interested in the technology.
[26:45.150 --> 26:46.150]  At least here in America.
[26:47.150 --> 26:48.150]  Especially some of the certain states that you had mentioned.
[26:49.150 --> 26:52.150]  Don't do the correct line breeding and stuff.
[26:53.150 --> 26:54.150]  It's all just pumped out continuously.
[26:55.150 --> 26:57.150]  So for the fact that for you to kind of know that.
[26:58.150 --> 27:02.150]  I hope that the beginner audience that watches this show weekly with us.
[27:03.150 --> 27:05.150]  Again, you're putting in the time every week.
[27:06.150 --> 27:09.150]  You're lifting, putting in, getting your gains three hours a week.
[27:10.150 --> 27:13.150]  And you're learning from almost everybody that's been on the show.
[27:13.430 --> 27:15.430]  Is that genetics truly do matter.
[27:16.430 --> 27:17.430]  And when we first got into this.
[27:18.430 --> 27:19.430]  To be able to get super lemon haze.
[27:20.430 --> 27:21.430]  That made me smirk just a second ago.
[27:22.430 --> 27:23.430]  Because it was such a process.
[27:24.430 --> 27:25.430]  You had to order that overseas.
[27:26.430 --> 27:27.430]  And then maybe it didn't get there at first.
[27:28.430 --> 27:29.430]  So then you had to email them back.
[27:30.430 --> 27:31.430]  And they made a second attempt.
[27:32.430 --> 27:33.430]  And it got to you.
[27:34.430 --> 27:35.430]  So he's got all of these old school problems.
[27:36.430 --> 27:37.430]  And issues that I felt like beginner farmers.
[27:38.430 --> 27:39.430]  OG type farmers have.
[27:40.430 --> 27:41.430]  But he's dealing with them currently.
[27:41.710 --> 27:42.710]  In modern day situations.
[27:43.710 --> 27:44.710]  And hats off to you Bob.
[27:45.710 --> 27:48.710]  Because it's frustrating to grow that way.
[27:49.710 --> 27:52.710]  Especially when so many variables are out of your control.
[27:53.710 --> 27:54.710]  Like the electricity when you're flowering.
[27:55.710 --> 27:59.940]  Yeah man, it's crazy.
[28:00.940 --> 28:02.940]  You actually made me think I went on a different train of thought.
[28:03.940 --> 28:05.940]  I wanted to mention the other two lines that I got from Bushman J.
[28:06.940 --> 28:08.940]  The wine was probably one of my favorite plants.
[28:09.940 --> 28:10.940]  It's so loud when it flowers man.
[28:11.940 --> 28:12.940]  It's black dust.
[28:13.940 --> 28:16.940]  And the dog from Humboldt crossed with Afghan roadkill heirloom.
[28:17.940 --> 28:19.940]  And that one I didn't get any mails.
[28:20.940 --> 28:22.940]  So I wasn't able to create some F2s to line breed.
[28:23.940 --> 28:24.940]  But it's stupid loud.
[28:25.940 --> 28:29.940]  And another one I've got that I've actually got a couple F3s going at the moment.
[28:30.940 --> 28:31.940]  I'm going to be making F4s.
[28:32.940 --> 28:35.940]  Is a Skittles backcross 3 from Dying Breed Seeds.
[28:36.940 --> 28:40.940]  That Bushman crossed with Bushfire OG.
[28:41.220 --> 28:43.220]  Which was this.
[28:44.220 --> 28:55.430]  Uh oh, looks like you cut out Bob.
[28:56.430 --> 29:02.790]  Alright, well audience, just I guess you understand.
[29:03.790 --> 29:05.790]  Please be patient with us as this kind of probably will happen a few times.
[29:06.790 --> 29:09.790]  But this is quite an insight to be able to learn today man.
[29:10.790 --> 29:14.790]  And the genetics, like when you were ordering them from, I think it was Altitude was the big one.
[29:15.790 --> 29:16.790]  At least for our little peer group.
[29:17.790 --> 29:18.790]  Attitude.
[29:19.790 --> 29:20.790]  Attitude Seed Bank. That's what it was.
[29:21.070 --> 29:25.070]  And you know that was the one that would, we always joke that after we grew it out.
[29:26.070 --> 29:27.070]  It was like the t-shirt was worth more than the genetics.
[29:28.070 --> 29:29.070]  Thank you.
[29:30.070 --> 29:31.070]  It was goofy times back then.
[29:32.070 --> 29:34.070]  And so then we would be growing other genetics that we got from a homie.
[29:35.070 --> 29:38.070]  I remember driving up to Independence Pass man to get the purple cush.
[29:39.070 --> 29:43.070]  That was the first time I was ever, you know, anybody had ever in our group had seen, you know, real purple genetics.
[29:44.070 --> 29:46.070]  That weren't like Kool-Aid flavor.
[29:47.070 --> 29:48.070]  That was special when you saw that first purple.
[29:49.070 --> 29:50.070]  You know what I mean?
[29:51.070 --> 29:52.070]  And you're like, wow, this shit is true.
[29:53.070 --> 29:55.070]  And then I think it was like bog seeds, bushy old guy.
[29:56.070 --> 29:59.070]  That was the first time I've ever saw cannabis that had like a blue tint to it.
[30:00.070 --> 30:01.070]  He had this stuff called blue moon rocks.
[30:02.070 --> 30:05.070]  So when I was growing that and actually started understanding more of the microbial world,
[30:06.070 --> 30:08.070]  that's when those colors started to come out, at least for my skill set.
[30:09.070 --> 30:15.070]  I know others can achieve certain things, but I was growing super boof Marco when I was growing with like advanced nudes and
[30:15.350 --> 30:24.350]  aqua flakes, all that kind of like really heavy, you know, they give you a fancy book and you're trying to follow it week by week.
[30:25.350 --> 30:27.350]  And I just never, I don't know, man, I didn't.
[30:28.350 --> 30:29.350]  That wasn't the skill set.
[30:30.350 --> 30:37.350]  And that's again why I'm, you know, you and I are such proponents for this is because you don't necessarily have to be that great at farming,
[30:38.350 --> 30:39.350]  especially when you first get into this.
[30:40.350 --> 30:43.350]  Yes, as things are going by, your skill set needs to improve dramatically, obviously.
[30:43.630 --> 30:50.630]  But to first get into it, it's not as daunting as it would be like truly understanding pH levels, parts per million,
[30:51.630 --> 30:55.630]  trying to figure out plants, you know, if you've never even really, you don't even really know what botany means.
[30:56.630 --> 30:57.630]  It's going to be pretty hard to grow in that manner.
[30:58.630 --> 31:02.630]  But when you're relying on the microbial world, it's just different, man.
[31:03.630 --> 31:08.630]  And I think if you start from day one that way, you're going to be able to see all of these genetics for who they truly are.
[31:08.910 --> 31:16.910]  You're going to be able to pick out some of the prettiest girls in the bunch, run those lines down, continue to work that, maybe find out more about her.
[31:17.910 --> 31:22.910]  You know, we used to always joke about that, like, you know, you need to go on a date a couple of times before you really start to talk to a few ladies.
[31:23.910 --> 31:24.910]  So that's that same stuff.
[31:25.910 --> 31:28.910]  I feel like, you know, putting in the work on this is pheno hunting is endless dating.
[31:29.910 --> 31:32.910]  And you got to continue to up that because you want to find those that stick out.
[31:33.190 --> 31:40.190]  And if you could find a lemon haze that really kept that that lemon citrus flavor back in the day, that was up there with blue dreams, man.
[31:41.190 --> 31:47.190]  So if you have blue dreams and you had super lemon haze and you had golden goat, boy, people were driving past dispensaries to fuck with you.
[31:48.190 --> 31:55.190]  And that's really the goal, I think, that Bob's probably getting into now is I got to understand these genetics better than my peer group so that people want to come.
[31:56.190 --> 32:02.190]  And, you know, however that thing works, you know, it's always goofy with the I sign up and I give you my plants, you know.
[32:03.190 --> 32:09.190]  And then Simon or whatever, it's like this weird gray legal, but not legal.
[32:10.190 --> 32:16.190]  Like anybody that's growing knows that I think just staying in the gray world is probably best, or at least in America is probably best.
[32:17.190 --> 32:19.190]  Yeah, because then you don't have to deal with all that stuff.
[32:20.190 --> 32:21.190]  And you don't put your name on a list either.
[32:22.190 --> 32:25.190]  Now, when you got your red card here in Colorado, you weren't allowed.
[32:26.190 --> 32:28.190]  Once you got that, you weren't allowed to have a concealed carry permit anymore.
[32:28.190 --> 32:32.910]  more. Yeah, so you were giving up some certain rights that I feel like a lot of people, at
[32:32.910 --> 32:38.750]  least here in Colorado, maybe some other states that that's important to them. And I don't know,
[32:38.750 --> 32:43.470]  there's something to being able to carry a gun without everybody knowing about it. And just
[32:43.470 --> 32:49.150]  because you smoke weed, you have to give that up and do it legally. Yeah, I've never do it legal,
[32:49.150 --> 32:55.150]  but I like what he's doing, man. And you drop bars right there, bro. Definitely. Like, I think
[32:55.150 --> 32:59.790]  that's so important. But look, what look what he's doing. He's starting out and he knows it's a
[32:59.790 --> 33:04.990]  lifestyle. He's running this line. I know, man, this is my life. I'm doing this for the next five,
[33:04.990 --> 33:09.870]  10 years, right. But as long the way I want to speed up that process. I'm sharing with genetics
[33:09.870 --> 33:14.590]  along the way. And you also said, you know, he's got to get to know his genetics. You got to date
[33:14.590 --> 33:19.390]  that girl. You know, you don't want to just go on one day to start talking about getting married.
[33:19.390 --> 33:23.470]  You know, that's a sucker move. You know what I mean? And it's the same with a plant. Like,
[33:23.470 --> 33:28.110]  even when I get cuts from these big dogs and stuff out there that are, you know, got all the
[33:28.110 --> 33:34.830]  hot cuts, I run them two, three, four times before I say, yeah, that's I like that bitch or like that
[33:34.830 --> 33:39.710]  girl. You know what I mean? And so that's just kind of how how I do it, man. And for him to be
[33:39.710 --> 33:47.230]  taking this stuff from seed now with the goal and he's into natural, there is Bob.
[33:48.190 --> 33:51.950]  Sorry, guys, I was just listening to you guys talk. Okay. So,
[33:55.310 --> 33:59.230]  well, just know if we're talking about stuff that we're filling time. So if you're back,
[33:59.230 --> 34:05.310]  then just please interrupt. Yeah, man, the living soil really allows the genetics to shine.
[34:06.910 --> 34:11.630]  And I find it's tricky. I often start out with the intention with unpacking,
[34:11.630 --> 34:18.190]  starting with a five pack or 50 or 100 seeds. I'm really looking for the full expression of
[34:18.190 --> 34:24.350]  the plant, whether that's good or bad. So I often get hermaphrodites or intersexual plants,
[34:24.350 --> 34:30.990]  whether that's because of the stresses, heat stresses or light schedules, interruptions and
[34:30.990 --> 34:37.710]  all of that sort of thing. But I find the living soil also allows for the bad genetics to express
[34:37.710 --> 34:43.390]  themselves so they can be removed from the gene pool. They too accepted with most genetics and
[34:43.390 --> 34:48.190]  people just want to blame the grow or blame the environment. But everything comes down to the
[34:48.190 --> 34:55.390]  genetics. And I find that's that's the final key. Once you've got everything else down,
[34:55.950 --> 35:04.760]  the only thing that you can level the genetics and. When done this.
[35:05.480 --> 35:11.550]  I got to give you bars on that because you said something that was real deep.
[35:11.550 --> 35:17.150]  We want to give the genetics credit on the positive side or look at the thing brought
[35:17.150 --> 35:21.710]  out, look at look what all that the genetics, the natural farming did. Right. We're talking
[35:21.710 --> 35:26.830]  about the soil and the living soil. And what you said is that living soil also brings out
[35:26.830 --> 35:32.270]  those bad genetics because it's letting the plant fully express itself. So he's also taking
[35:33.230 --> 35:38.350]  the positive that we get from natural farming and using that benefit to weed out. Dope, Bob.
[35:38.350 --> 35:41.950]  I like that, man. You can talk more on that if you want to, brother. I like that.
[35:43.550 --> 35:53.950]  Yeah. Also, yeah, it's I've got some friends in Spain and I often have
[35:54.670 --> 35:59.150]  run in a lot of. We're having trouble hearing you.
[36:03.280 --> 36:05.040]  Once developed, that's a breed.
[36:07.440 --> 36:14.320]  This feel. Bob, you're cutting in and out, brother. Did you try resetting your modem at all?
[36:14.880 --> 36:21.200]  Because if you can reset your modem, that may make a difference. That's straight from Peter. So
[36:21.280 --> 36:24.240]  other than that, you're cutting in and out really bad.
[36:26.160 --> 36:33.600]  OK, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over to my mobile data and it's that.
[36:36.400 --> 36:41.680]  OK, go ahead, guys. He's just jumping off. He'll jump back on.
[36:43.860 --> 36:48.260]  Well, I don't I don't want to assume things, but from what I what I've always heard, too,
[36:48.260 --> 36:53.060]  like South Africa is a pretty wild place, man. People kind of always said that there's so many
[36:54.020 --> 36:56.820]  parts of it that are obviously beautiful, just like anywhere.
[36:57.380 --> 37:00.420]  But there are certain places that are kind of like Chicago where
[37:01.300 --> 37:06.660]  where life life is cheap, man, you know. And so I was hoping that we could kind of talk about
[37:06.660 --> 37:12.020]  those questions, too, because I would imagine that if certain people found out that they
[37:12.020 --> 37:17.460]  you were growing cannabis, I mean, that's another worry that would probably be put on your plate.
[37:17.460 --> 37:21.860]  And that's what I was kind of getting beforehand. Marco, it's it's the unknown, man, or maybe
[37:21.860 --> 37:26.100]  even the fear of the unknown or the uncertainty. So when you meet up in that hotel room and you're
[37:26.100 --> 37:31.940]  just questioning everything about like there's a lot that always goes through your head and people
[37:31.940 --> 37:35.460]  are lying to you if they don't think about that stuff. Maybe they're foolish if they're not
[37:35.460 --> 37:40.580]  thinking about that. But both sides are constantly wondering, like, is today the day that you're
[37:40.580 --> 37:45.060]  going to fuck me over? And when you know that finally everything's in your driving home,
[37:45.060 --> 37:50.100]  you're like, oh, I'm silly. That would never happen. But sometimes it eventually did happen
[37:51.060 --> 37:57.300]  to you. I had a friend in Savannah, his own damn uncle robbed him straight up. No, no mask,
[37:57.300 --> 38:02.980]  nothing. Just took his shit, his own uncle. So, you know, South Africa, from what I understand,
[38:02.980 --> 38:08.340]  is kind of ruthless like that, too. Like, well, back up. Bob's back. What's up, guys? I'm on the
[38:08.340 --> 38:13.620]  mobile data. Let's see if this is a bit of a better connection. Mike sounds kind of already
[38:13.620 --> 38:19.300]  sounds better already. Yeah. OK, sweet. Let's just hope the data lasts. I'll keep the camera
[38:19.300 --> 38:25.780]  killed, though, so we can get through the show. Sure. Hey, and we appreciate all the frustration
[38:25.780 --> 38:31.620]  part of this. It's going to be a man. I've got a lot more respect for the people that have been on
[38:31.620 --> 38:41.140]  the show previously. Yeah. Dealing with it live is kind of tough. Right before you fell off,
[38:41.140 --> 38:45.460]  I was I want to ask that kind of almost like a touchy question, because I've always
[38:45.940 --> 38:51.860]  kind of understood that there's parts of South Africa that can be pretty wild. Obviously,
[38:51.860 --> 38:56.900]  there's beautiful spots, but there's other spots that are just, you know, from day to day,
[38:56.900 --> 39:01.220]  it is kind of like if you're familiar with like the way Chicago is growing up, like when you walk
[39:01.220 --> 39:05.700]  out, there's even parts where I grew up in Atlanta like that. When you when you leave your house,
[39:05.700 --> 39:10.340]  you don't know what kind of fuckery could be could be about. So you always have to kind of like walk
[39:10.340 --> 39:13.540]  with your guard up and you're always I mean, there's just certain things that you have to do
[39:13.540 --> 39:18.740]  in those kind of places. Is that true in your area? And do you have to kind of you know,
[39:18.740 --> 39:22.660]  when you leave your house, is it more like, you know, you just got to make sure you're not looking
[39:22.660 --> 39:35.390]  at the ground and can be a potential easy target. Yeah, man, it can be tricky. Some areas are
[39:35.390 --> 39:41.310]  definitely more dangerous than others. I find I always like to look at the positive side of things.
[39:41.310 --> 39:46.510]  But you know, you walk around in the wrong area with the wrong thing showing someone's going to
[39:46.510 --> 40:04.870]  take it you know. I was mugged at gunpoint. Damn. He said it. Yeah. It's like when you when
[40:04.870 --> 40:10.070]  you're reading something where it's redacted. All the juicy stuff is like can't I know over there
[40:10.070 --> 40:15.270]  we my wife's friend was they went we didn't go they invited us to South Africa doing my research.
[40:15.990 --> 40:22.470]  You guys came up to me. There you go. Sorry, guys, man, that cut out quickly.
[40:24.070 --> 40:29.910]  Well, we heard the main part. Yeah. If you want to just kind of start from that from that part over.
[40:30.710 --> 40:39.670]  So yes, I was I was mugged at gunpoint in 2019 2018. So you know, you walk around in the wrong
[40:39.670 --> 40:45.030]  area, things do end badly. But I guess that's true for any country. You know,
[40:45.030 --> 40:51.510]  there are more hungry people, I guess. So my area, I'm in the middle of nowhere.
[40:51.510 --> 40:58.310]  So I could walk a bit and I don't see too many people. But being in the city, certain areas,
[40:59.510 --> 41:02.390]  I wouldn't walk around at night with a beautiful lady, you know.
[41:02.870 --> 41:10.540]  Wow. So so there's potential harm to to your companion as well as to you
[41:11.900 --> 41:18.300]  in certain areas like that. Yeah, I guess that's my biggest fear. Even living out here on the farm,
[41:18.300 --> 41:24.780]  there's guys that break in, they cut our fences, my our neighbors, they steal their livestock
[41:24.780 --> 41:31.180]  every now and then. So that for me, living by myself, I don't mind. But having a partner in
[41:31.500 --> 41:35.660]  the house, I think that's the biggest fear, man, because you can defend yourself.
[41:37.100 --> 41:41.340]  But when you when you've got a woman in your life, and and people break in,
[41:41.340 --> 41:47.820]  they don't often have the best intentions. So that that's one of those things you have to just
[41:47.820 --> 41:54.140]  accept. I guess I've also had another experience with that sort of shit. When I started my first
[41:54.140 --> 42:02.300]  apartment, guys broke my fence and broke into the house and stabbed me. I got stabbed in the back.
[42:02.860 --> 42:08.860]  So yeah, I guess that's not the best representation. But I still love the country,
[42:08.860 --> 42:13.740]  you know, it's just we've got to just deal with with a little bit more than I think others have
[42:13.740 --> 42:19.660]  to. Well, I know Mark and I just enjoy having candid conversations. And, you know, we've both
[42:19.660 --> 42:24.460]  shared stuff in our past that we regret and things that have happened. And so, you know,
[42:24.460 --> 42:29.420]  just to be put in those situations and you're coming out, you know, still living and breathing,
[42:29.420 --> 42:36.700]  buddy. So that's you got to get you a stick, man. You say that, Marco. It's funny as hell.
[42:36.700 --> 42:42.540]  I've got a thing I call the green stick. It's pretty much like a knopkiri. So it's a stick
[42:42.540 --> 42:47.900]  with a nice little beefy piece at the end. And I covered it in green duct tape. And that stick
[42:47.900 --> 42:53.900]  saved my life that night they broke into my house. I may have got stabbed in the back,
[42:53.900 --> 42:58.060]  but they left with broken ribs and they didn't have one cent of anything of mine.
[42:59.180 --> 43:05.420]  OK, well, good brother salute to that. Be safe, man. And I'm sure the law allowed it. You would
[43:05.420 --> 43:11.820]  have a bigger stick, you know, a bigger stick. And, you know, I'm not a fan of firearms,
[43:11.820 --> 43:17.420]  but living out on the farms, they definitely can come in handy, you know? Yeah, definitely.
[43:17.900 --> 43:22.860]  Stay safe. Well, let's get back to the positive. It's rough over there, people. Yeah,
[43:23.820 --> 43:30.300]  I think they're also like our people, our poor people have big screen TVs and air conditioning
[43:31.020 --> 43:36.060]  cars and rims and shit like everybody. Those are ours, Marco. You know what I'm saying?
[43:36.700 --> 43:41.100]  But over there, they might not have my fucking shoes. I'm going to take your shit.
[43:42.060 --> 43:44.460]  Yeah, man, I'll take your shoes off your feet, bro.
[43:44.780 --> 43:49.260]  Thank you. So let's keep that real. We can't get too comfortable over here.
[43:50.540 --> 43:56.940]  Definitely, man. I've just come quickly inside to fetch my notes. I'm sitting outside in the
[43:56.940 --> 44:02.860]  greenhouse. I've got some really good phone signal and got some LEDs so I can see everything nicely.
[44:04.540 --> 44:10.220]  Awesome. Well, I know part of this show was that you need help kind of like putting out
[44:10.220 --> 44:14.540]  your marketing and branding. So if we have an excellent connection, then I would love to give
[44:14.540 --> 44:21.020]  back to you for you taking your last 45 minutes here and kind of explaining South Africa in a
[44:21.020 --> 44:27.500]  very candid way. And we appreciate that. I mean, I think sometimes it's nice to know that, you know,
[44:29.340 --> 44:33.980]  there's a lot of shit that goes on in the world. And so if we can kind of remember our place in it
[44:33.980 --> 44:40.140]  and focus on the like Marco's, like the positive, the gratitude, that's what I want to see a lot of
[44:40.620 --> 44:46.140]  You must always be grateful, you know, even despite all these upsets, I absolutely love my
[44:46.140 --> 44:51.740]  country and all the people in it, even those people that mugged me and stabbed me. So we had
[44:51.740 --> 44:57.740]  realization to come to, but without them, I wouldn't be sitting exactly where I am right now.
[44:57.740 --> 45:03.420]  So I'm grateful to all the people on my path, whether they were good or bad within the
[45:03.420 --> 45:09.660]  circumstance, you know, and we've always got to look for the positive. I find life, life has a
[45:09.660 --> 45:18.060]  way of finding balance, but yeah, let's get back into the advice. So I've always struggled with the
[45:18.060 --> 45:24.860]  reach. So I guess the show would help a lot with that as is, you know, the marketing and reaching
[45:24.860 --> 45:30.940]  a wider audience has always been an issue of mine. And while putting together a lot of these
[45:30.940 --> 45:36.300]  questions, the bigger picture is worth it. You know, the, the, the ideas I have collecting my
[45:36.300 --> 45:41.740]  colors to paint the picture in the future. It, it, it seems worth it. So all these questions
[45:41.740 --> 45:48.620]  essentially come down to how to buy some time, because that's when the bigger picture makes sense.
[45:49.180 --> 45:55.100]  All that you need is a little bit of time and space. And I find that can, it's simple, but I
[45:55.100 --> 46:01.660]  find even that can be tricky at times. So I wanted to ask simple things. You guys have both worked in
[46:02.220 --> 46:09.100]  industries and you, you hustlers of your own, right? So I wanted to know craft versus commercial,
[46:09.100 --> 46:15.180]  how do you guys sort of set yourself apart? How, and does the consumer really care at the end of
[46:15.180 --> 46:20.140]  the day? What, what goes in on the backend? How do you, do you feel about that?
[46:22.540 --> 46:25.260]  You want me to go first on that? Yeah, go ahead, Brian.
[46:26.060 --> 46:32.780]  So it's very rare that you could say craft and commercial within the same sentence, same brand.
[46:33.580 --> 46:38.060]  It's almost like you have, you come to a fork in the road and you either pick commercial,
[46:38.060 --> 46:41.500]  meaning that you're focused on like three, four pounds of light. You're just trying to
[46:41.500 --> 46:47.100]  pump the shit out. You could care less about quality, care less if people really almost even
[46:47.100 --> 46:51.260]  really admire your brand. You're just going after like just straight monetary gains.
[46:51.580 --> 46:55.260]  Sorry, what was that? You're just going straight for sales. You know,
[46:55.260 --> 47:01.580]  you don't really care about the client satisfaction. Right. And so when you hear people
[47:01.580 --> 47:05.820]  complain about pricing or, you know, they put all this, you know, some of these companies even put
[47:05.820 --> 47:10.060]  millions of dollars into this stuff and then they can't sell the product. It's because a lot of
[47:10.060 --> 47:14.620]  people have that mindset where it's, Hey, we're just going to pump out so much cannabis that
[47:14.620 --> 47:18.460]  we're going to drop the price ourselves. We're going to, we're going to rule the market. Our
[47:18.700 --> 47:25.820]  focus is to be, you know, the common man, weed dealer. And some people like that. But the educated
[47:25.820 --> 47:32.460]  consumer is starting to see that it's worth it to them to get like the higher quality stuff,
[47:32.460 --> 47:37.420]  the higher quality flower. Individuals I personally know that are now getting into smoking more
[47:37.420 --> 47:43.100]  flower. They can tell the difference without me, you know, kind of setting up almost like a Pepsi
[47:43.260 --> 47:47.900]  challenge type thing with where people that might not necessarily smoke cannabis all the time are
[47:47.900 --> 47:52.380]  now even, you know, if you kind of show them a little bit, like, did you notice that's, that's
[47:52.380 --> 47:58.460]  harsher on the throat? So you're not going to, you're not going to really see craft cannabis,
[47:58.460 --> 48:04.060]  in my opinion, anymore in the commercial space, unless it's like a smaller mom and pop shop.
[48:04.060 --> 48:10.460]  So I feel like to distinguish yourself thinking long-term, it's okay to be a small business.
[48:10.460 --> 48:15.660]  Thinking long-term, it's okay to be a small time farm. That should be the badge of honor.
[48:15.660 --> 48:20.620]  So many people like apologize for it, but that's the badge of honor in my opinion,
[48:20.620 --> 48:26.060]  is that you're a small craft individual. And it seems like more understanding the road that you're
[48:26.060 --> 48:31.980]  down living soil, building your own microbial world. Ken's showing your Instagram here right now,
[48:32.700 --> 48:37.980]  live with us, that your, your road is definitely going to be towards the craft where you want to
[48:37.980 --> 48:43.180]  create high end. And so not only do you have to have the flour to back that up, but now you need
[48:43.180 --> 48:49.580]  to, in a way, sometimes pivot with a couple hours a day and focus on building your brand and building
[48:49.580 --> 48:55.660]  your brand is in my opinion, an umbrella term for all of the little things that you have to do,
[48:55.660 --> 49:02.060]  having a website, being on Instagram, you know, finding ways to get outlets and this kind of thing
[49:02.060 --> 49:07.340]  with YouTube. And hopefully from here, buddy, more people want to, you know, interview you and stuff.
[49:07.340 --> 49:11.900]  And sometimes that happens. So there's just a lot of ways where once opportunity knocks,
[49:11.900 --> 49:16.620]  you just take advantage of it. And so that was one of the things that I feel like a lot of brands
[49:16.620 --> 49:21.420]  missed at the beginning is they were just, Hey, I'm a grower. I'm just so focused on growing.
[49:22.220 --> 49:27.020]  And the, and the individuals that focused on growing as well as branding, maybe they're not
[49:27.020 --> 49:33.660]  even the best flower company out, but the consumers see it that way. And once the consumer sees it
[49:33.660 --> 49:37.980]  like that, you're off to the races. Now, if people are willing to wear your hats and your t-shirts,
[49:37.980 --> 49:43.340]  you know, that that's not only are you building a brand, but now it's like, it's, it's becoming
[49:43.340 --> 49:47.580]  like a culture to some individuals. And the easiest example of that is the cookies.
[49:48.460 --> 49:54.700]  That's, that's the idea with the whole NFT collection. I made, so each one's a unique
[49:54.700 --> 50:00.780]  design, a variation on the logo. And the owners actually own the actual design. So there's going
[50:00.780 --> 50:05.100]  to be merchandise. They're going to be having caps and hoodies and all that sort of thing with
[50:05.100 --> 50:10.700]  their own design. And some have even bought more than one so they can flip it later on when the
[50:10.700 --> 50:17.020]  brand's obviously doing more successful. And, and stupid things. I've actually got the website
[50:17.020 --> 50:23.740]  written down here. I know you feel it's extremely important, but what I found is I didn't, I had a
[50:23.740 --> 50:30.140]  website up for quite a while and it wasn't really closing any sales for me. I find that having
[50:30.940 --> 50:37.500]  people having access to me via WhatsApp or social media, I could close the deals that otherwise
[50:37.500 --> 50:43.580]  could be closed on the website. And I had a really bad month recently. So unfortunately I had to shut
[50:43.580 --> 50:50.220]  the website down because I just didn't see the returns of it. But I guess longer term building
[50:50.220 --> 50:56.380]  the brand, you need to have that street address for people to visit. I think you got to grow into
[50:56.380 --> 51:00.620]  everything you do, brother, especially when you're already a grower, right? That's, you already know
[51:00.620 --> 51:06.060]  the concept. Think about it. You're already set in for that five to 10 year just running your line.
[51:06.940 --> 51:13.500]  So I think you need to have that same idea with growing a business. The sales are going to drive
[51:13.500 --> 51:18.060]  you to that website at one point. I know what Brian's going to say, and I know the value of
[51:18.060 --> 51:25.260]  the website, but also until you get to a certain volume, a website doesn't make financial sense.
[51:25.260 --> 51:31.100]  So I think you go as hard as you can, push all your avenues, all your social medias, everything
[51:31.100 --> 51:36.540]  you can do. And when you say, man, I need more places to sell, then that's when you kind of say,
[51:36.540 --> 51:41.660]  all right, sales are driving me into a website. You know what I mean? As far as going back a
[51:41.660 --> 51:49.340]  little bit on the craft and commercial deal, I feel like craft is definitely becoming a lost art.
[51:49.420 --> 51:56.860]  I feel like a big part of craft versus commercial is going to be the trim. The amount of time you
[51:56.860 --> 52:02.860]  can spend on that trim, to me, that's where the money is. What trim do you want? You want a $2
[52:02.860 --> 52:06.380]  trim or you want that $10 trim? You know what I mean? That's where-
[52:06.380 --> 52:10.700]  Is it thrown in a bucket or is someone carefully getting each one of those leaves off?
[52:10.700 --> 52:17.740]  Correct. Because I'm to the point, I don't want to, I don't touch a flower. I only touch
[52:17.740 --> 52:24.940]  flowers if I'm curious on smell. I don't try to break a single trichome head off any flower
[52:25.740 --> 52:31.100]  on any time on a plant. And that's just how I am. You know what I mean? Until it's time to
[52:31.100 --> 52:35.500]  crumble it or it's time to do, wash it or whatever we're going to do.
[52:35.500 --> 52:39.740]  Yeah. You don't steal those triches off early, man. It's beautiful to you.
[52:39.740 --> 52:44.540]  But that's just personal preference. To me, that's where the average person, sadly,
[52:45.100 --> 52:50.460]  doesn't really pick up on those differences. You know what I'm saying? It's the kind of
[52:50.460 --> 52:59.100]  sewer level, like all of us and the family here, we want to really push that and get that ultimate
[52:59.100 --> 53:04.300]  quality. I know I like it and that's probably why I'm just a stickler for cultivating my own.
[53:06.940 --> 53:11.900]  Yeah, man. That higher end flower, some of the flower, man, the first time it gets touched is
[53:11.900 --> 53:17.980]  when the consumer crushes it up in their grinder. And like you said, it's got all the trichomes that
[53:17.980 --> 53:23.660]  grew on it. But then, like you said, the end consumer, I'm not sure if they care too much
[53:24.460 --> 53:31.420]  at the moment, at least. So I've just got to get in touch with more connoisseurs, I guess.
[53:33.820 --> 53:39.020]  And more education, brother, on how to be a connoisseur and what to look for in cannabis,
[53:39.020 --> 53:45.100]  what to look for in the trim, break a flower, is there a hole in there? Some people don't even
[53:45.100 --> 53:49.580]  know I had to break somebody's stuff open and say, look at that, man. Like, oh, I didn't even see
[53:49.580 --> 53:56.860]  that. I've been thinking about that a lot. The marketing versus education, because I hate to
[53:56.860 --> 54:02.380]  insult the market. Education is marketing. Think of it that way. Because the market's fairly ignorant,
[54:03.180 --> 54:09.100]  not to insult it, but they're ignorant towards a lot of the things. So I've tried to more
[54:09.100 --> 54:13.740]  focus on the educational side of things, also show people what goes into growing some really
[54:13.740 --> 54:20.060]  dank flower. And I've found that it's helped somewhat, because if people can see what goes
[54:20.060 --> 54:25.660]  into it, they realize that it's not the same as that other bud they're getting from a bulk supplier
[54:25.740 --> 54:26.300]  or something.
[54:29.180 --> 54:34.540]  Absolutely. I want to help you by breaking this down a little bit deeper. Some marketing people
[54:34.540 --> 54:40.620]  say, let's unpack this. OK, so let's unpack the website part, right? So you're talking about,
[54:40.620 --> 54:47.580]  I need marketing. So we need a spot where we can educate the consumer on why your stuff is different.
[54:47.580 --> 54:52.540]  And that's where the website comes in. So we need to break down. When you say nobody's coming or
[54:52.780 --> 54:58.780]  it's not effective, I'd love to know what you had on the website. What was the focus of that? How
[54:58.780 --> 55:05.020]  many pages were on there? Do you remember that kind of stuff? Yeah, it was a fairly basic website.
[55:05.020 --> 55:11.900]  I learned to make websites a while ago. I used to work in drone development. So I got a lot of
[55:11.900 --> 55:18.860]  skills from that industry. So I did a basic website just with the introduction. It had a
[55:18.860 --> 55:24.380]  gallery link that showed the Instagram page. And I was starting a bit of a blog,
[55:25.100 --> 55:29.580]  but I didn't find I had the time to allocate to do the blog correctly.
[55:31.260 --> 55:36.860]  And then obviously, I wanted to have a shop for the various NFTs that are still left because
[55:36.860 --> 55:43.580]  it's a limited collection. But I've still got some left that are available. And then I send packs to
[55:43.580 --> 55:47.580]  each of the people. So I thought it would be nice to have that accessible on the website.
[55:48.300 --> 55:52.860]  But then it didn't get much attention. So sort of fall by the wayside.
[55:55.180 --> 56:01.020]  Well, I feel like a website is just like a plant. So if you put it to the wayside,
[56:01.020 --> 56:05.660]  to the side, it's not going to be anything. And when you first are building your website,
[56:05.660 --> 56:13.020]  you have to remember that all the algorithms are judging you, your brand, by how you start to put
[56:13.020 --> 56:17.980]  that up. So you don't necessarily have to build your mansion in one day. But the algorithms,
[56:17.980 --> 56:22.060]  the Google bots, all that stuff, I'm probably not even using the right terms, but I hope you guys
[56:22.060 --> 56:27.340]  get what I'm saying. The way that they send out stuff to find out how... They notice you're
[56:27.340 --> 56:31.980]  changing the site. Yes, they are spiders. That's what they are like spider bots. So they send those
[56:31.980 --> 56:36.540]  things out every now and then, right? And it comes back. And as long as Google sees that you're
[56:36.540 --> 56:41.500]  improving things, it's almost like they're like, okay, but if the bounce rate is super high and
[56:42.140 --> 56:47.020]  you haven't touched the website in six months, it's just going to tank everything. So you have
[56:47.020 --> 56:51.740]  to nurture that the same way you do with your plants. And you have to realize that you have
[56:51.740 --> 56:56.780]  to have a website that distinguishes itself from others. Otherwise, people are going to go to
[56:57.580 --> 57:04.460]  somebody else that is explaining things a little bit better than you are, or has been around a lot
[57:04.460 --> 57:09.420]  longer. So that's where the audience is going to trust that. The way that you distinguish yourself
[57:09.420 --> 57:14.700]  is through education. So on my website, on a variety of other ones, on Marco's,
[57:15.420 --> 57:19.900]  more from him doing the show and all that kind of stuff, we're educating so that people go to
[57:19.900 --> 57:25.500]  the website and then there's even more education on there. And I have certain things on there we
[57:25.500 --> 57:31.820]  can talk about here in a minute on the website that give people kind of that... There's a face
[57:31.820 --> 57:36.380]  to the business. So there's like an about us page. We'll get into that more, but I wanted to dive
[57:36.380 --> 57:40.700]  deeper into what kind of content did you have on there? Because if you're just talking about,
[57:40.700 --> 57:46.220]  this is me, this is what I do, as most people do when they first put up a web, that's not what
[57:46.220 --> 57:51.260]  people are interested in. And that's the brass tacks of it is if they're on their website,
[57:51.260 --> 57:59.260]  they're there for themselves. So if I'm going to close a sale, I have to discover whatever that
[57:59.260 --> 58:04.860]  need is. And so on the back end of stuff, you kind of look at who's coming to what pages on
[58:04.860 --> 58:10.220]  your website and whatever that top page is for that month or two months. You continue to clean
[58:10.220 --> 58:15.180]  that one up. Maybe you add a few links to that. Maybe add a little YouTube thing. You really
[58:15.180 --> 58:22.300]  focus on the pages that are driving the actual traffic. And if you're with a decent web provider,
[58:22.300 --> 58:27.500]  they're going to provide all of that for you. And so the focus has got to be, I'm putting up a few
[58:27.500 --> 58:33.020]  things on the wall. I'm letting the audience see if any of that sticks. And if any of that sticks,
[58:33.020 --> 58:39.020]  it's almost like, fuck the rest of the content. Focus on that one piece of content that's driving
[58:39.020 --> 58:44.060]  the traffic. And then others will start to branch out. If you see that nobody's liking one of the
[58:44.060 --> 58:51.180]  other articles that you put out, just get rid of it. Just delete it. So you have to fine tune that
[58:51.180 --> 58:56.300]  stuff. That has to be at least a weekly thing on your mind that, all right, I got to at least add
[58:56.300 --> 59:01.500]  some things to my website. If you're e-commerce, if you're just a basic, static type website,
[59:01.500 --> 59:05.740]  you need to have some kind of blog or something where people are wanting to check out what you're
[59:05.740 --> 59:10.060]  talking about. And if you don't think that the time and effort is worth it, I don't think,
[59:10.940 --> 59:15.900]  in my opinion, I don't think you're thinking long-term like, this is to everybody. Because I
[59:15.900 --> 59:20.620]  hear that time and time again, where they put up a website and they just put it up there. And then
[59:20.620 --> 59:29.020]  it's up there for months and months and they haven't touched it. That's a red flag to Google.
[59:29.020 --> 59:34.620]  So we got to refocus on, if I'm a farmer, I'm a grower, I'm watering my plants and I'm watering
[59:34.620 --> 59:39.100]  my website just as much, or I'm trying to water my website just as much.
[59:41.970 --> 59:47.250]  Yeah. That's bars right there. That makes sense. And it is like a baby. You can grow it fast or
[59:47.250 --> 59:53.250]  grow it slow. You know what I mean? Grow that website with your business, but use it as a tool.
[59:53.250 --> 59:59.650]  All those things make a lot of sense, man. So now, does that change how you were using it?
[01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:01.810]  Yeah, I definitely wasn't.
[01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:20.440]  Well, shit. Are you there, Bob? While we're waiting for him, Marco, why don't another
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.640]  question I have for you, buddy, is you're obviously starting to become one of the kings
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:29.320]  of Instagram. So in our own little niche, so do you mind sharing with people like you have
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:35.000]  unbelievable content? And so, when some people are talking about, oh, Instagram's rigged,
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.320]  I put out content, nobody liked. There are certain people out there that can just continue to get
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:43.720]  that and you're one of them. And I think it's maybe they just don't put out quality content,
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.040]  so not everybody's rocking with it like they used to.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:54.200]  Well, Instagram's funny, man, because really, I feel like I'm almost at a thousand posts, right?
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:01:00.120]  So I'm at like 900 or something posts. And I think at a thousand, I'm going to stop using that page
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:06.040]  and just leave it up there as an archive and check it now and then. I feel like I've seen so much
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:12.280]  growth that has happened around me and some of the folks haven't even had the content. So I feel
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:21.560]  like it's algorithms. Shadow bands are a real thing. I try to do a giveaway and I got so many
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:25.480]  followers that are cannabis folks, which is wonderful. But then now all of a sudden my page
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:31.880]  gets hit with hundreds of cannabis likes. And I think that triggers the algorithm. And I've had
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:36.680]  to take giveaways down because of that. And it's like, we've said it time and time again, Brian,
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:45.560]  like Instagram kind of, it's to me, it's like almost a start. It's fading. It picked up steam
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:51.560]  in our community. And sure, a lot of people are using it as an effective tool, but it's hard to
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:56.520]  archive the info. Meaning like if you go to somebody's page, it's hard to go back and kind of
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:03.080]  find it again sometimes as far as like that. And then I just feel like with them taking half of our
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:10.280]  legends, our real legends shit down at any given moment. You know what I'm saying? It's kind of-
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.800]  It's like building a map on a beach.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:19.080]  Yeah. And Brian, you've said that, it's like almost like building that home on the sand. So
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:23.240]  yeah, glad to hear you back in there, Brian. Well, not only on sand, but it's somebody else's
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.960]  sand. That's kind of more analogy I'm using, right? So you build this mansion, it's not on
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:33.400]  your land. And then the landowner comes and goes, that's my land, that's my mansion. Fuck off.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:39.640]  Yeah, definitely. And yeah, Brian, hearing you talk, my website was definitely the plant in the
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:45.320]  back of the grow, you know, forget to water it every now and then. So there definitely needs
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:51.560]  to be more focus on that. But I'm only one man with only so many hours in the day.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:58.520]  But that is the beauty of the website is that is your mansion on your land. So whether you're able
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:04.280]  to build it right away, like I'm saying, at least- And the spotter bots look at that way too. As
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.280]  long as you're improving on it, you're going to start to hit those. And if you can eventually,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.040]  for your niche, get into the top, you know, on the top first page, and especially in the top
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:19.800]  five of the first page, you're going to start to see a huge amount of traffic. And that,
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.120]  there is no shortcut for that. And so that's why I think getting started,
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:29.160]  you know, especially once you're focused, like, all right, I got a logo, you know, I have a URL
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:35.080]  idea of what I want, buy that domain, and then get that up. And then for most of us out there,
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:41.800]  buy a high quality template that you can kind of cater to your liking. If you're trying to build
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.920]  everything from scratch, because you're trying to save 250 bucks, it's not worth the headache.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:53.160]  Again, just save up some money. 250 bucks, that's how much I spent on my template for my website.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:58.600]  And it opened up a huge door because I didn't have to build all that other stuff. I mean,
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:04.440]  it's not like it's out of the box. You just, you know, there's still work to make it all shiny and
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:10.280]  look pretty and stuff. But the basic function of it is worth that 250 bucks. And if you're going
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.440]  with an eCommerce site, I've said this time and time again, in my opinion, I think there's
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:19.720]  something with Google and Shopify. Because I've been on WordPress, I've been on Wix,
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.760]  there's just something there. So if you are trying to sell things, not just educate, you know,
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:29.240]  there's two different worlds in that there's the you know, your educating world. Sounds like that's
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:35.080]  what the website that you had. And again, content is king with that. And then on the eCommerce side
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:41.800]  of things, it's really more customer satisfaction, how quickly you know, are you getting the sales
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.880]  out, that kind of stuff. And then obviously, you need to build on your inventory. And all of those
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:51.240]  things, in my opinion, are going to take at least a year or two. So there's no, there's no secret
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:57.320]  to having a website pop off unless you're really lucky. Most individuals have to have it out there
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:03.800]  for a year or two before things really start to, you know, come to fruition for them within like,
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:08.520]  or what they what's called as organic search, meaning you didn't pay for those people. It's
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:14.360]  just Google rewards you because you have a quality website. And that can be achieved. I spend $0
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:21.240]  on on search, all of my search comes from organic. And you can rubber ducky isopods, there's a
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:26.520]  variety of different platforms where you can fact check me on that stuff. And for the last three
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:30.440]  months, just so I can, you know, bring receipts to this so that other people will put time and
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:37.080]  effort into their websites. I'm now hitting 40,000 visitors a month. So this is a numbers game when
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:41.720]  you're talking about anything that we're doing, and especially on the on the World Wide Web.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:48.200]  It's a very small net, but in my niche, it's huge. So that allows me as the months go by and
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:53.080]  continue to add things and that kind of stuff. Google rewards that. And that's what everybody
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:57.800]  that wants to be a cannabis farmer is trying to build their brand, they have to realize that
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:02.120]  the end game is that people are wearing your hoodies. And the only way that you're going to
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:07.960]  get to that point is people have to know about you. And your flower has to back that up as well.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.880]  There's a lot of people obviously out there with the marketing and the branding without the flower.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.760]  There's also just as many people that have amazing flower that could care less about marketing and
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:22.680]  branding. And they feel a certain way about it. But they also don't have the monetary means and
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:28.200]  gains they should for the talent that they have. So Marco and I and other individuals, excuse me,
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:33.960]  on this platform, I feel like are trying to, as best we can blend those for our community so that
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:38.360]  you guys can find success from both worlds. Because otherwise, you're going to find everybody
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:43.000]  that's badass growing and everybody that's badass marketing and stuff. And if you can kind of find
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.840]  your own niche between those two worlds, you can carve out a little enough money for your family
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:55.960]  to do pretty well for yourself. Yeah, man, it is with the commercial and bigger business coming
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:02.200]  into the space, there's not going to be much left of the pie for the smaller farmers. So it's going
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:07.320]  to be the ones that can really get in the business sense of things. You know, the profit margins
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:14.280]  aren't what they always have been. We are a couple of years behind you guys, I guess. But the prices
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:21.320]  and all of that is tanking quite badly. And so it's not as easy to make a living anymore in the
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:25.080]  industry. So it's those that understand the business and the branding that are going to get
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:31.560]  ahead at the end of the day. It's just tough to do that with so many people in the industry.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:36.520]  Setting yourself apart can be tricky, but I guess you've just got to survive the long haul.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:44.360]  I've been doing this now probably three, four years, self-employed and surviving, but not always
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:49.560]  doing as well as I feel I should be doing with the work that I see coming from myself.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:55.080]  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense, man. Yeah, definitely dropping some bars, Brian. I remember,
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:00.920]  man, shoot, it was probably a year or two ago, whenever it was, you sent me a text. We were
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:06.360]  texting. You were like, man, I got like, my traffic was like 4,000 last month. You know what
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:12.120]  I mean? Here you say 40, that's dope, man. That's 10 times the growth in a year or less than two
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:17.560]  years, really. So that means a lot, man. You can never touch that on Instagram. Like, that's real
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:23.000]  people. And that's where I think I'm going to go with mine is actually, that's how to get on with
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.440]  me is on my website is to take the time. I bought a little starter kit. I'm not going to lie. You
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:34.600]  can get in the website game. I bought my domain though, which is Mike Rose by Marco. So I own
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:41.960]  that piece, but just the template of the website is just part of the square deal, probably 400 or
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:48.760]  500 bucks. And then you just fill in and go from there. But now I'm going to go and get serious,
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:54.040]  have a website built, man, and go ahead and make that like a living, growing thing, like you said.
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:59.720]  And I think the amount of traffic that I can bring in that way will be a better goal than
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:05.240]  the followers I get on Instagram and well worth the investment much more so.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:14.440]  Yeah. And I saw Dan was throwing up like long-term keywords and stuff and those are important. But
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:20.600]  before you really focus on that kind of stuff, you need to yourself probably the best money I
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:25.080]  personally have spent, especially having a Georgia education is that I pay for a subscription on
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:32.600]  Grammarly. So I just get stoned and I sit down and I write and believe me, that shit is red and green
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:40.440]  and purple, brother. And then once those thoughts have gone through, I go back and I correct all
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:45.800]  that shit till Grammarly tells me I got a 99 with a little check mark. And all of that can be done
[01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:52.920]  for like 30 bucks a month. So you're able to write your own high quality content for fairly cheap,
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:56.600]  where you don't have to outsource that. And Marco, if you're paying for somebody to build
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:04.440]  your website, I would also have them if you want to teach you how to add the products.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.920]  Because anytime you have to add a product, otherwise you're going to have to hire somebody
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.240]  to do that for you. And I am constantly adding products and moving stuff. So if I had to pay for
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:18.520]  that, exactly. Georgia education plus Grammarly, now it looks like I'm a professional. I'm using
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:25.000]  commas and semi-colons and shit, dude. I don't even know how to, before Grammarly. So there are
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.120]  a lot of tools out there now that can allow you to write your own content. And then that way you
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:35.320]  really can try to communicate with your audience. And I do feel like that's a skill set. You might
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:39.960]  not get it right away, but you continue to write. It's going to come and you're going to be better
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:44.680]  than others because most people don't put any time into that. And I hope that you see, Bob,
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:49.640]  if you were my competition, you weren't putting time into that. If we're using kind of an analogy
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:55.160]  here. So I'm every single day, I'm getting a little bit ahead of you on the websites,
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:02.280]  ethernet world or ether world where, so the more individuals that come to my website every day
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:07.080]  that don't go to yours, I just gained that much more of like a marathon edge on you.
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:12.360]  And since this is a marathon of life, this is the way I think a lot of individuals need to think is
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:27.210]  the website is where you can build real wealth for yourself in time. So Marco, definitely.
[01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:33.690]  Are you there, Bob? I think we might've lost him again. Okay.
[01:11:36.010 --> 01:11:39.290]  You're on mute, Bob. Okay. Try that, Bob.
[01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:43.930]  No, we've lost your audio signal, Bob.
[01:11:44.570 --> 01:11:48.730]  Well, hey, man, websites are important. Definitely want to grow with that website.
[01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:53.690]  And, uh, but, you know, if even, um, two years ago, Marco, I would have, I think I would have
[01:11:53.690 --> 01:11:58.170]  been saying the opposite, dude. I think I've been saying you really need to focus on your Instagram.
[01:11:58.170 --> 01:12:02.970]  You really need to focus on your Instagram. That's what brings the traffic. And then from my own
[01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:09.210]  backend, you know, Google analytics and stuff, the sales aren't coming from Instagram, dude.
[01:12:09.370 --> 01:12:13.850]  And there's a big difference on that because most people that started business, they have to use
[01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:19.050]  what's known as paid search and that can be extremely pricey. It could be like 10 cents a
[01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:28.570]  click. I mean, excellent. I do, uh, do you have any, um, like Instagram content questions for Marco?
[01:12:30.490 --> 01:12:34.970]  Bob, you've got two signals coming in. You want to go first or you want to go second?
[01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:43.940]  Bob, you've got two signals coming in. You might want to, oh, there were now the one now. Good.
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:51.280]  Try that. Sweet. Can you hear me? All right. Yes, sir.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:58.320]  I know a lot of people want to ask Marco's Instagram questions. Oh, there we go.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:06.000]  Sweet. Yeah. I wanted to ask, um, the balance of showing work being done versus just allowing the
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:13.680]  product to speak for itself. Um, so how much of the internal behind the scenes work should you
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:20.880]  share? Do you share, um, versus just, you know, showing the end genetic slash flower extract,
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.760]  um, is there value to sharing the work that went into it on your social media?
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:31.760]  Yeah, I think so. I think that's a, I think social media is a great place to build. If you're going
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:38.080]  to grow, then go ahead and focus on growing that social media because then that kind of can give
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:43.200]  you your legs and kind of bring you, it brings people with you when you do go to the website or
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:48.400]  when you add the website simultaneously where you got them on Instagram and then you also got them,
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:52.960]  um, hitting the site. But I think that's key, man, because like they always say, you know,
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:58.720]  content creator, but I, I'm not creating content. It's when I take the time to say, all right,
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.960]  let me get out my phone and film this, you know, before I'm doing it. Usually, man, I miss,
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:07.200]  I don't show a lot of my stuff because I'm like, I'm just going to do it. You know what I mean?
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:13.600]  I invested in a GoPro now so I can kind of be hands off and do a little bit more setup and just
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.160]  kind of let things go. Um, and then come back later and edit. And that's kind of where I'm
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:23.760]  going now is, um, a little bit more into YouTube, grow the Instagram or whatever you're on, man,
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.840]  but use that as a tool to kind of bring people with you to, you know, kind of your crew or your
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:33.120]  people or your, or your same type of folks. And I think you can do it valuably there, but I'd
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:38.880]  definitely like to show what I'm doing. Um, cause I'm not, I want, that's the education. Like you'd
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:43.600]  be surprised, man. You'd think, and I know you're mostly talking about your line, but show what you
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.400]  do, man. Show, show what plants you don't like, what you reject, why you rejected it, you know?
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:51.920]  And then they'll say, well, damn, I like, I like his line of thinking. So that's, you know,
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:57.440]  could be definitely added bonus to your content. That's a great point, Marco. And I think
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:04.240]  Smiley is one of the main people that I still to this day see, um, you know, highlighting the
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:09.760]  mess ups of the grow or issues with the grow. Um, so that might be something that you could bring to
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:15.120]  your little niche in South Africa is like, Hey, look, all of us have these bullshit little corners
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.800]  or pockets that are fucked up, man. So I'm showing these to you guys. And I think that, you know,
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:24.560]  it resonates with people when they talk about, you know, I've had struggle with whatever it may,
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.480]  it allows you to relate to them. Uh, cause it's like, Oh man, I've had that issue. Or,
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.080]  you know, when you mentioned powdery mildew, almost everybody has dealt with that before.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:35.600]  So they kind of just get it like, yeah, man, if you've dealt with that, you've dealt with
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.000]  some bullshit. And so there's this, um, camaraderie that's kind of built sometimes
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:53.890]  by sharing your mistakes. We lose him, Ken. Well, he's still there. I think he's just a
[01:15:53.890 --> 01:16:02.450]  real bad leg on a lot of it. Okay. Yeah. I like that. Chad Westport shout out Chad funnel people
[01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:08.130]  to your website. Definitely. Great way to do it. That's just bringing a little bit more of,
[01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:12.210]  like you said, funnel in men. It takes many streams to make a big river, you know,
[01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:16.930]  bring a little stream in here and there and grow this stream more. Right now. I have time to grow
[01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:21.410]  this one more times. A lot of it guys. I know everybody says, well, you got time, we've got 24
[01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:26.370]  hours, but a lot of things take you. You're one person, you know what I mean? And that's why I
[01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:30.850]  like Brian and I talk, you know, having a significant others crucial, because that's a two
[01:16:30.850 --> 01:16:36.930]  of you. Now it's another person you trust as much as yourself with your money and with everything
[01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:42.210]  else. Um, and that's crucial, man. That's different than a business partner, a business partner is
[01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:48.850]  another man can always do something shady, can always think something and turn his back, turn
[01:16:49.090 --> 01:16:53.090]  on you or anything, you know, and a woman can do that too. But when you build that, you know,
[01:16:53.730 --> 01:16:58.370]  good solid bond with someone you live in with them every day, you kind of get to know that,
[01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:03.330]  Hey, I trust this person, you know, with everything. So whatever you can do to expand your
[01:17:03.330 --> 01:17:10.130]  one self key, you back Bob. Yeah, I'm back. Sorry. I could hear you guys. I wasn't aware
[01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:19.090]  that you couldn't hear me. Um, so can you hear me now clearly? Yeah. Sweet. Another thing I wanted
[01:17:19.090 --> 01:17:28.210]  to ask you guys, um, about scaling up versus keeping small and keeping limited, um, both with
[01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:34.690]  flower and extracts as well as genetics. Do you feel there's benefit in being sort of limited and
[01:17:34.690 --> 01:17:41.250]  exclusive or just bulking up and making it available to, to the masses?
[01:17:43.650 --> 01:17:50.050]  And can you still keep that, that higher end craft level while scaling up? Cause that's something
[01:17:50.050 --> 01:17:54.930]  I've been struggling with a bit. I'm trying to grow a bit more plants, but I'm not able to give
[01:17:54.930 --> 01:18:00.530]  each one as much attention as I usually would be. All right, boom. There there's your answer.
[01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:04.930]  Like the way I look at things, I was just telling my wife this the other day, I was like,
[01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:10.770]  I forget what it was right now, but it was something about the quality of like food or
[01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:18.130]  something. And, and I said, well, if you can't do it, that quality, then you're selling too much.
[01:18:18.690 --> 01:18:23.810]  Like then you're, then you can't sell that many pancakes or whatever it is. If you can't do this,
[01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:30.770]  this many of things, well, um, then that's, that tells you you're doing too many. And so that's
[01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:36.770]  when people put profit before, you know, quality. And you know, to me that quality is where you're
[01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:42.210]  going to have the longevity. I'd rather much have be selling my teapots, right? We've said that on
[01:18:42.210 --> 01:18:48.770]  another show and have a long line outside the house, right. For my teapots, then I would rather
[01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:54.450]  have 10,000 teapots and I can't get, you know, I'm just sitting on them. Right. So I feel like
[01:18:54.450 --> 01:19:00.450]  that quality is what's going to drive the, your, um, demand. And so you always want that demand
[01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:06.370]  to be more. So that's why you got to have better quality. To add on that. I think you have an
[01:19:06.370 --> 01:19:12.050]  advantage, Bob, because you're now breeding. So some people might, uh, you know, there's two ways
[01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:15.570]  that individuals could find out about you, one through your flower and then one through your
[01:19:15.570 --> 01:19:21.890]  genetics. I think that is a huge advantage. If there's like cannabis meetups, uh, bigger
[01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:32.190]  conventions, does, does that stuff exist out there? Oh yeah. He's gone. I didn't even notice
[01:19:32.190 --> 01:19:39.630]  him drop off. I would imagine there's not too many, like he's back. Hold on. Are you there, Bob?
[01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:48.270]  Yeah, man. I'm so sorry about this guys. It's not your fault, Bob. Believe me, it's not your fault.
[01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:54.430]  It's just the way it is. So are there, are there like cannabis meetups and that kind of thing? I
[01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:58.910]  know you said you're like in the middle of nowhere, but you know, if you chose to drive, I mean, I've,
[01:19:58.910 --> 01:20:03.070]  I've driven a couple hours for an event and stuff like that. Even with the expos now, you know,
[01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:08.430]  sometimes I got to drive multiple days to get there. Is there, is there ways for you to get your
[01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:16.030]  brand out there in like a major city or that kind of stuff? Starling. There are some events that go
[01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:23.870]  on. We've got that cannabis expo that happens in some of the towns here. I've gone to some of them
[01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:30.030]  just as a visitor. I've never had a booth at one of the stores. That's definitely above my price
[01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:37.230]  range. Let's talk on that for a second. Everybody says that, right? And I don't think, I don't think
[01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:41.950]  you're going to, especially how, when you're just doing your own genetics, that a booth is going to
[01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:47.070]  actually be beneficial because you're stuck at that booth. So you're limited to who comes up to
[01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:52.430]  you where when you're, when you got a backpack on and it's just you, I'm saying you don't even have
[01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:55.950]  the friends with you. Cause sometimes they can talk to people. Like if you're really focused on
[01:20:55.950 --> 01:21:01.470]  trying to get your brand out there, put a backpack on with genetics, go by yourself, and then just
[01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:06.670]  try to talk to as many people as you can at those things. Having a booth is a hindrance in my
[01:21:06.670 --> 01:21:11.070]  opinion, when you're first getting started, because it limits you to who comes up to you.
[01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:15.710]  When you're the backpack guy, you get to, you get to go to all the different booths. And I think
[01:21:15.710 --> 01:21:22.910]  it's way of a better ROI for two days of your time. Networking, networking, networking.
[01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:29.950]  Oh yeah, I get that. So that's definitely the thing. I've also teamed up with some of the
[01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:34.350]  local shops. You know, your cannabis grow shops when they've had launches and that,
[01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:39.230]  and I've done seed giveaways. I've given away a couple of hundred beans
[01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:47.230]  with positive feedback as far as anyone's let me know. So there's those sorts of things I've
[01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:52.670]  done to get the brand out there. I've also done quite a few giveaways, but I don't find the
[01:21:52.670 --> 01:21:58.430]  giveaways always give as much return on investment. Like you say, it's just followers on Instagram.
[01:21:58.430 --> 01:22:00.030]  It doesn't convert to sales.
[01:22:04.190 --> 01:22:04.990]  Good point.
[01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:10.990]  But yeah, so, so those sorts of events, they do happen and I do try and get to them,
[01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:12.430]  slap a sticker if I can.
[01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:18.750]  Yeah. Do you have, yeah, stickers are great too. Slaps, people love that. It's a great way for
[01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:24.750]  people to remember you, you know, again, goes with a great product that has to lead the way.
[01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:29.390]  And then all those other things come behind it. But yeah, definitely get out there, man. Like you
[01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:35.230]  said, I think you mentioned social clubs. I remember traveling to Spain and it was like,
[01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:40.350]  you know, you have to do your research before you go there because there's like social clubs,
[01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:44.750]  you have to join for a period of time when you're there and that's how you can, you know,
[01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:48.990]  get what you need. Are you into things like that? Are there meetups and whatnot?
[01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:59.270]  Yeah, it was wild, man. I was on a wild goose chase. Every little city we went to,
[01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:03.670]  we had to find a spot. One spot, I could smell it. I could smell it, kept smelling it,
[01:23:03.670 --> 01:23:07.990]  walking through these streets. But finally a dude came out this weird looking door
[01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:12.950]  and I just kind of just watched him. I was like, yeah, he's a hack. So I was like, boom,
[01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:17.110]  went in there and it's wild, man. The things people go through to kind of get around the
[01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:23.110]  laws or kind of work with the laws, man. But it worked, man. He joined up for a small
[01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:29.510]  fee. Can't mention, when you go in there, you pay up front, then they let you in the back.
[01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:34.070]  When you're in the back, you can't mention certain words. You just have to say,
[01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:40.070]  I'd like to try. I'd like to try an eighth of the blue dream. Or I'd like to try. You can't,
[01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:44.470]  you know, certain words they say will throw you right out if you say bye or, you know,
[01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:49.270]  anything like along those lines and then they let you try it and then, you know, when you leave.
[01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:50.230]  It's wild, man.
[01:23:52.630 --> 01:23:57.910]  There's this place in Aurora here in Colorado called the Big Tomato. And when it was first
[01:23:57.910 --> 01:24:02.230]  established, if you said anything other than that, you know, you were growing tomatoes,
[01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:06.630]  they would kick you out. Right. That's how I thought that was funny. Because you'd be there
[01:24:06.630 --> 01:24:11.990]  like, I'm having problems with my, oh, shit, you know, I mean, they weren't like super strict on
[01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:16.310]  it. But yeah, nobody was in there saying cannabis, this cannabis that it was like,
[01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:20.310]  almost like the water pipe bong days. You know, it's like everybody would turn their head if you
[01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:26.150]  were in there saying, hey man, common code, shut the fuck up. My local guys got that sign on his
[01:24:26.150 --> 01:24:31.190]  shop here in town, right on the door. Don't mention these words in here because you know,
[01:24:31.190 --> 01:24:38.150]  you got people that are brand new. It's the same story. There you go. Coming in hot. It's the same
[01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:44.870]  story. The side in the social club. You can't, you can't mention that you're buying or selling
[01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:53.070]  anything that's illegal, you know. See, to me, I don't know, like, what's your thought on that?
[01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:55.790]  Can you guys hear me all right? Yeah, we're listening.
[01:24:58.110 --> 01:25:02.030]  When it comes to the clubs, Bob, I want to kind of get Marco's opinion on this because you're
[01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:05.710]  asking like, you know, especially speaking long term, do you think you should kind of go that
[01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:09.790]  route where now you got to deal with all those things? Or if you're still in the gray area,
[01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:14.830]  no matter what's going on, just be in the regular gray market, do your thing for a while because,
[01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:21.230]  you know, when Colorado popped off, it seemed like the guys that did it right. There's one guy
[01:25:21.230 --> 01:25:27.310]  with a huge skunk emblem, if you know who that is. You know, he already had a little bit of money in
[01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:32.510]  his pocket, so he's able to run with it. And I think those individuals were able to find more
[01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:37.870]  success that way than getting constantly hammered, especially if you don't have a huge bankroll,
[01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:43.790]  going the more like, I don't know, what is that? That's not even the gray market, is it? I mean,
[01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:47.790]  if it's legal, but at the same time, it's not federally legal. Where when we say the gray market-
[01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:53.230]  You don't want to be on paper. You don't want to be on paper. That's what it boils down to. You
[01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:57.710]  know, when you join that club or whatever now, you're technically on paper because they probably
[01:25:57.710 --> 01:26:01.550]  have something they have to turn into the government to keep stuff on record. I mean,
[01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:06.670]  that's kind of what it boils down to. If you want to go that route, be in the system,
[01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:11.710]  be subject to the bullshit of the system. You know, when I traveled, I'd much rather have
[01:26:11.710 --> 01:26:16.910]  known a guy, like say Brian's cousin lived there or something. Hey, it's great. Go there,
[01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:19.630]  you know, but you got to join. You got to do what you got to do sometimes.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:28.440]  Yes, he's got some IMO going. You still there, Bob?
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:35.080]  No, he dropped off again. We'll wait for him. Well, he's just lagging on. I'm probably lagging
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:42.840]  him out. That shit looks like jelly. Some extracts. Yeah, this is his extracts page.
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:47.400]  The last I.G. was his normal I.G. This is his extract I.G. guys.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:56.840]  I'm back again. Can you guys hear me? We can. Okay. So, yeah, man, I heard you guys talking
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:00.760]  about the social clubs. It's the same this side where you've got to be careful about what you're
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:07.160]  saying and all that. Some people have suggested to get my flower and extracts into a wider market
[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:15.560]  to sign up for the clubs. But like you say, having your name on a list coming from the industry I've
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:21.160]  been in and the life I've led, I don't exactly want to put my name on any list just to be able
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:29.320]  to sell a plant that I believe should be free. It would allow a reach that I don't have just
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:36.280]  naturally. But I find I want to. I mean, this for the long haul, you know, like let the work speak
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:42.120]  for itself over time. I know I can survive the hustle. I've got the grind. I've survived worse.
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:47.960]  So it's just a matter of time, essentially. But I definitely don't see myself ever
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:52.600]  joining into a club or signing up for anything. I enjoy the gray area.
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:01.720]  Yeah, we spoke on that a couple of times. I think there's just more in a weird way
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:08.040]  predictability with that. Like both sides need each other. Both sides have the common enemy.
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:12.600]  So for the most part, as long as everything's all right, you don't want to fuck up or sever
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:17.320]  that connection because you're both feeding each other. Where in the in the suit world,
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:21.320]  it seems like the goal is just get as much information and then fuck everybody over.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.720]  Yeah. Are your things available? Are any of your products available
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:33.640]  genetics wise? Or are you just kind of very local and tight with it now? I missed that earlier.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:42.840]  The genetics is sort of at a point where it's a limited membership. So anyone that owns one of
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:50.680]  the NFTs, they have a membership token and access to anything I have at the moment. And I've got a
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:57.640]  pricing schedule that I've put together with F1s through to currently I've got F4s,
[01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:04.200]  where it goes from about a dollar a seed, probably up to about four or five dollars a seed.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:10.680]  And that's just it's because I find they're still unstable. So I don't want to put them to the
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:16.680]  public market. But if people are willing to purchase one of the membership NFTs to support
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:27.000]  the brand, those are going for between 100 and 160 dollars at the moment. They have free access
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  to the beans and are happy to send people as many as they want. But they must just understand that
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:40.120]  it's a journey still being done. You know, it's not at the final destination yet. I'm working
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:47.320]  them towards I want to get to about F7 on the various lines. Currently, the one I've got at F4
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:54.600]  is a Black Cherry Punch Cross GMO Mac, which has some really loud, tasty turps on it. So I want to
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:30:01.400]  stabilize that. I've got that Skittles Bushfire I'm also stabilizing. And I want to get to IBLs.
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:06.520]  And then once I get to IBLs and true F1s, I'll probably put those onto the market,
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:14.200]  but linked to limited NFTs. You know, I love the the the blockchain technology and what the NFTs
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:19.240]  allow. So people can publicly show they bought that genetic, they've got that pack and that's
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:28.280]  in their wallet as an NFT. But currently they're only available to two members. Thanks. I thought
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:34.200]  it was a cool way for me to to get the stuff out there while still being able to work on my own
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:42.120]  stuff. And some of the NFTs. So what it basically is, there's different tiers. And on the one tier,
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:48.520]  the people pay 400 bucks, our currency, probably about 20 dollars. Your guys currency, they pay me
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:53.640]  monthly. And then I send them a 12 pack of whatever seeds are produced over the time.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:31:03.000]  So I sent off some packs today. The guys got four 12 packs, just some F2s and then some F4s.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.880]  And so I'm sending those out to the guys. And then there are some special class NFTs that came
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:14.120]  with free membership. So those guys obviously paid a little bit more, but they're getting free seeds
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:20.520]  for as long as I'm alive. But and it was it was quite shocking when I released the collection in
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:25.960]  February and I honestly thought I'd be pushing to try and get sales and it would be the cheaper ones
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:31.160]  that got out first. But I've got some people that really believed in the picture and they bought
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:36.680]  some of those more expensive ones. And they were actually the first to go because I guess people
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:43.240]  saw the long term return on investment. And that's why I'm extremely grateful because I've got those
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:47.960]  sorts of people that believe in what I'm trying to do. Just need to be able to reach a few more
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:53.720]  and have a few more people just see the long term goals of this plan.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:58.760]  So what does a pack look? What are you looking like now? Are you still getting
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:03.640]  herms in a 12 pack or are you fairly stable at least? You just don't have the
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:10.120]  you still have a little bit of diversity that you don't want to see. Is that what it is or where are
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:18.760]  you? It all depends on how the genetics started out. So, for instance, that's Skittles Bushfire
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:27.960]  line. It's fairly solid on the F2s. I popped about 50 of them and only one of them popped some
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:33.320]  Nanas on the one Nug. Whereas I've got some other lines. I mean, the one I sent off today,
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:39.160]  I was reluctant to send it off because I just popped probably about 10 of the F1s.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:47.960]  And it was a Sorrows Ruin Crossed Sure Breath. And I made the seeds with them just to get an F2,
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:55.720]  to get some more seeds to go through decently. But they hermied so badly that I put a warning
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:33:00.920]  on the seed pack and I'm like very sexually unstable. You can pop it if you want to,
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:06.600]  but it's not really where I would say it's solid. But a lot of the stuff, I mean,
[01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:15.560]  on that Black Herry Punch Crossed GMO Mac, I popped about 60 of them. And I did get three or
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:23.160]  four hermies. So, I've still got a long way to go, I feel, before I can say it's bulletproof.
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:28.200]  I want the stuff to be foolproof, man. You should be able to pop a bunch of beans,
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:33.320]  get fairly uniform structure and no matter what happens, you get some Nugs out of that.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:41.640]  But at the moment, I wouldn't say they're stable. But definitely some fire. I've had some great
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:46.920]  feedback from various people that I've grown some really good stuff. One of the more popular ones
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:53.720]  seems to be one I've called Killer Cake Haze. It's a plant called New York Green Cake, which
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:34:00.600]  was New York City Diesel crossed with OG Kush crossed with Blueberry. And that was one of my
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:07.000]  phenotypes. It was stupid frosty, really loud profile. And then I hit that with the Ale Afi
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:14.200]  Lemon Cheesecake male. And I've taken those to F2. But that just produces spears of flower, man.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:21.400]  It stretches hard. I had to kick some out the indoor grow because they just stretched way too
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:27.080]  hard. But really top to bottom, beautiful Nugs. And that's one I'm really keen on working as well.
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:36.200]  How much value do you put on or what's your thoughts on new genetics and someone new gets
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:42.840]  their hands on them and you get a Herm? Some say, you know, you got to run it again. And when you
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:47.880]  run it again, you don't get it. I'm just asking. I hear a lot of talk about that. And a lot of
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:54.920]  times, there is that, you know, so there is that, you know, people say when you run it from seed,
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:35:04.200]  sometimes the plant hasn't fully balanced all its hormones. There's some thoughts that if you run it
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:10.760]  from the clone, then it's a sexually more mature plant. So all the hormones are balanced out and
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:17.560]  it might not Herm me on you. So I guess there is that aspect. But I feel if you get a plant,
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:22.920]  a decent size, you know, I sometimes do smaller runs. But if the plant's going to Herm me,
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:27.560]  it's going to Herm me. And I'm focusing on seed runs. I can't always tell people, you know,
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:34.040]  pop a 10 pack, find a good clone and then run that clone. Some people are interested in running
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:42.520]  fields of seeds. So I want my stuff to be solid from seed, you know, it's nice to have access to
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:48.440]  clones and to be able to run clones when you need to do flower production. But I feel there's value
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:56.760]  to be able to plant a field of seeds and have fairly uniform crops and not have to tell people
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:07.210]  to run it again. But I have definitely heard that as well. Now, I heard you mention Humboldt
[01:36:07.210 --> 01:36:14.570]  seeds. Are there other American brands that have found their ways into your stable genetics out
[01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:23.370]  there in South Africa? That's for sure, man. Most of the stuff being run, I guess, is American stuff
[01:36:23.850 --> 01:36:28.730]  across the board, you know, from in-house genetics, TurpFiend,
[01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:34.170]  who else? There's a bunch of the smaller guys that come through.
[01:36:34.170 --> 01:36:37.050]  TurpFiend is in South Africa. Wow.
[01:36:37.050 --> 01:36:43.770]  Yeah, man. There's a few people running TurpFiend stuff. You'd be surprised, man. Most
[01:36:44.490 --> 01:36:50.890]  American stuff is available locally. There's a few seed banks locally that really do some
[01:36:50.890 --> 01:36:58.250]  solid work. Everything from Pacific Northwest roots to mass medical strains. I ran his prairie
[01:36:58.250 --> 01:37:06.890]  glue recently, and I hit it with some Afghan IBL pollen as well as a reverse. I've done some
[01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:13.770]  fembreeding. I had an original glue crossed with a juggernaut cross slurry cane. And the juggernauts
[01:37:13.770 --> 01:37:20.410]  from Swamp Boy seeds, the slurry canes from in-house, and then a lot of the crosses I get
[01:37:20.410 --> 01:37:28.090]  from a breeder in Canada called Irish Dabs. He works with a lot of good American genetics,
[01:37:28.090 --> 01:37:32.650]  so I get from him, and then I can sort of work the lines and see what potential they have.
[01:37:34.890 --> 01:37:37.370]  Swamp Boy seeds. That's another one, man. That's crazy.
[01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:45.530]  Yeah. Obviously, you're dialed in, my friend. It's just kind of weird to us that we used to
[01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:52.010]  get seeds from overseas. Now things are changing, and now it's the American market that's now
[01:37:52.010 --> 01:37:57.210]  flooding the world with high-end genetics. Yeah. We're the best, yo. Fuck that. We're the best.
[01:37:57.770 --> 01:38:02.810]  Anywhere I travel, I try to travel with my own shit.
[01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:07.290]  I heard a Canadian mentioned in there, too, Marco.
[01:38:08.010 --> 01:38:08.890]  Nah, we're the best.
[01:38:11.210 --> 01:38:18.330]  Man, you guys influence the whole world industry, man, whether it's the flower brands that are
[01:38:18.330 --> 01:38:24.010]  popular versus genetics. Something gets popular that side, and then you see it come through like
[01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:30.250]  a wave over here in our country. But I do want to see the stuff from the local. I want to know
[01:38:30.250 --> 01:38:35.850]  what's that local hit, because I'm not vain enough to think that there's the best cannabis
[01:38:35.850 --> 01:38:40.330]  in the world. Who knows what's out there? I'm open-minded in those aspects.
[01:38:40.330 --> 01:38:47.210]  Unfortunately, there's some local stuff. Like I said earlier, I've got a Durban poison
[01:38:47.210 --> 01:38:54.410]  that a local OG bred, and it's at F16 at the moment. I'm still waiting to pop that pack.
[01:38:54.410 --> 01:39:00.730]  That's a real special pack. I want to do some real nice work with that. But that's about
[01:39:00.730 --> 01:39:07.850]  all that I've got that's truly local. Everything else, whether it's a local breed or not,
[01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:13.370]  they're working with something that's most likely from the States or probably Spain or Amsterdam.
[01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:22.090]  Is Amsterdam still doing things? Because at one time, they were the go-to, like we said earlier.
[01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:27.050]  Yeah, I'm not too sure. I think most of the seed production, that's how it moved over to Spain,
[01:39:27.050 --> 01:39:28.250]  maybe a bit in Italy.
[01:39:32.490 --> 01:39:37.610]  So, personally, are you paying attention to trends here in America and realizing,
[01:39:37.610 --> 01:39:42.250]  hey, how long does that take? A couple of months? Is that like a year that everybody's
[01:39:43.210 --> 01:39:46.250]  wanting the stuff that America had the previous year kind of thing?
[01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:54.250]  I don't follow trends too carefully in that sense. But I do notice when something gets popular that
[01:39:54.250 --> 01:40:00.810]  side, people start asking for it this side. I'm breeding with the Runtz at the moment.
[01:40:00.810 --> 01:40:06.570]  Just because it has such a hype name to it, there must be something else to it. So,
[01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:11.450]  I'm flowering those out at the moment for the first time. It's a Runtz Cross East Cross
[01:40:11.530 --> 01:40:16.890]  Grateful Bear from Jeff Salsa. He was involved in Gage Green Group,
[01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:18.730]  but now he's doing Keys to the Kingdom.
[01:40:22.410 --> 01:40:27.590]  That's crazy. You know who Gage Green Group is to me. That's awesome, man.
[01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:34.070]  You've obviously done your homework, man. And I think that's especially for people that are
[01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:38.870]  getting in newer to this. And a lot of people are trying to set themselves up for 2023 to
[01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:44.950]  grow without as many hiccups as they normally would have had. Again, investing in quality
[01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:49.430]  genetics, if you have the money, is worth it. And if you're just kind of growing out stuff that you
[01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:58.310]  got a clone from, we all start somewhere. The main part is that you're growing, I guess, is what I
[01:40:58.310 --> 01:41:04.710]  was trying to get at. But focusing forward, do you think that it's going to continue to be the
[01:41:04.710 --> 01:41:06.230]  American genetics? We've gone on.
[01:41:07.190 --> 01:41:15.190]  I do want to bring this back up because he actually, this is something that I found on his
[01:41:15.190 --> 01:41:22.630]  Instagram. And there happens to be a rubber ducky isopod called out on this post that he put out,
[01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:31.110]  which is a hell of a good backlink for some guy's website that he's building and keeps wanting to
[01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:36.470]  grow. This is how we grow those websites, guys. Get your backlinks in order.
[01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:43.910]  Well, let's be clear real quick, though. So when that is on Instagram, that's, I guess,
[01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:52.870]  an Instagram backlink. What we want is somebody to write www.rubberduckyeisopods.com on their
[01:41:53.430 --> 01:42:02.950]  website and link it. That's a backlink. So when you see things like in the people always talk
[01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:10.710]  about in the descriptions and it's a link to their website, that is a backlink. This is more of like
[01:42:12.150 --> 01:42:17.910]  an in-house link. Just as good, just as effective. But as you guys can see, I try to respond to
[01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:24.710]  those things. Not always seen because the algorithm is stupid for anybody that is involved
[01:42:24.710 --> 01:42:32.550]  in cannabis. The shadow banning and all that stuff, that is definitely real. I've gone myself
[01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:36.390]  with my old account where it seemed like, yeah, you're getting like three, four hundred likes
[01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:41.030]  within an hour or two. To now, all of a sudden, it seems like everything's slowed down. Again,
[01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:45.510]  I mean, content is part of that. But, you know, if you're rocking a wave and you are providing a
[01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:50.230]  certain amount of content, you would imagine that it would kind of stay the same. Sorry, guys,
[01:42:50.230 --> 01:42:55.910]  I'm back. All right. Excellent. But Instagram slows that down. So again, that's why you don't
[01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:59.430]  want to put all your time and effort into that, because when you are popping off and you're doing
[01:42:59.430 --> 01:43:04.710]  great things, your creativity is going to be hindered anyway. So again, you got to have that
[01:43:04.710 --> 01:43:10.550]  build that mansion, have that long term view of, you know, I want to beach. I want to have a
[01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:15.430]  mansion by the beach. And I might not be able to build that until a few years from now, but I'm
[01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:20.950]  going to go over and visit every now and then, maybe fix up a few things on my land so that
[01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:28.630]  the Internet world sees that I do care about my my URL. It means something to me. And at the
[01:43:28.630 --> 01:43:33.830]  beginning, that part matters. And then, of course, content is king. I mean, that's calcium is king
[01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:37.270]  and plants content is king when you're trying to bring people to your to your website.
[01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:43.590]  So sounds like NFTs, a lot of the I see someone in chat said someone bought one of Gage Green,
[01:43:44.630 --> 01:43:49.830]  one of their NFTs. Sounds like NFTs for seeds are kind of the new wave here.
[01:43:51.190 --> 01:43:56.950]  Yeah, Gage Green, the first people that sort of did it back back in the day, and it was actually
[01:43:56.950 --> 01:44:03.750]  a South African that bought one of the seed packs. It was a ridiculous pricing, though. They sold
[01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:10.630]  an NFT with the one of one pack and sold for a couple hundred thousand Rand. I'm not sure how
[01:44:10.630 --> 01:44:16.310]  many dollars that was, but it was ridiculously overpriced. But they set a standard, you know.
[01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:22.870]  Do you mind explaining what NFTs are for myself included on it?
[01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:23.830]  Yeah, me too.
[01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:31.750]  Okay, that's good. So you understand cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin and all of that sort of thing. It's
[01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:38.630]  essentially just what blockchain technology is, is a ledger. So what we've always used in society
[01:44:38.630 --> 01:44:43.670]  as our record keepers, our bankers and all of that. So they just balance the ledger books
[01:44:43.670 --> 01:44:50.950]  of society. What blockchain does is it allows that. So with Bitcoin and Ethereum and all of that,
[01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:58.390]  it just kept track of who owned which Ethereum and which Bitcoin. In recent years, they discovered
[01:44:59.190 --> 01:45:06.150]  that all that was was an empty box that you could put anything in on it. So you can't do it with
[01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:11.590]  Bitcoin, but with Ethereum, you could create a custom token. And in that token, you could put
[01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:19.750]  any form of digital code, be it a picture, be it music. There's some people in America that have
[01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:29.590]  sold house leases via NFTs. So all it is, is just a placeholder for something. So what I've done is
[01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:36.230]  created a membership token that's different variations of my brand, but give access within
[01:45:36.230 --> 01:45:42.710]  my brand. And start of the year, there was quite a boom in NFTs, but it was like the wild, wild west
[01:45:43.110 --> 01:45:50.710]  where there was a lot of like get rich quick mentality, where people wanted to buy something
[01:45:50.710 --> 01:45:56.550]  and then win a lot of money because they had seen the stuff sort of skyrocket. And there are people
[01:45:56.550 --> 01:46:02.710]  that became overnight millionaires. But where I find the technology is going to be best used is
[01:46:02.710 --> 01:46:11.670]  for existing brands to establish a sort of community and a home base. Everyone from artists
[01:46:11.670 --> 01:46:17.830]  to cannabis industry people. So instead of going to a record label, you do an NFT collection. And
[01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:24.870]  then what happens is it gives you that financial capital to follow through with what you want to
[01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:30.550]  do, as well as instead of signing it over to a company or suits, you're getting it, giving it
[01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:37.030]  back to the end consumer. So with my collection, the guys that buy them, they supporting my dream,
[01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:42.950]  but they also own a piece of my brand so they can buy and trade that. There's a marketplace
[01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:49.110]  called the Soul C marketplace because mine on the Solana network. And I've got one for the
[01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:55.190]  genetics as well as the extracts. And they verified on that marketplace. So people can buy and trade
[01:46:55.190 --> 01:47:04.630]  it like stocks. But it also gives benefits within the brand. So is DNA testing going to be starting
[01:47:04.630 --> 01:47:09.590]  to go along with this NFT, I guess, to kind of lock in the authenticity of it?
[01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:18.390]  I don't think I'll ever go that sort of route. I'm more intuitive.
[01:47:20.150 --> 01:47:24.870]  So I don't think I'll ever map the genome and all that sort of thing.
[01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:32.310]  As far as the NFT, though, I'm saying linking it to the NFT, maybe gaze green with that one. So for
[01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:38.390]  whatever it is, twelve thousand dollars, you ask for a pack of seeds. Would that be like,
[01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:44.390]  I need something to map. Tell me this is the only one of one. Does the NFT guarantee that?
[01:47:45.670 --> 01:47:51.510]  The NFT guarantees that. So essentially, if you are because with your NFTs, you've got a wallet.
[01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:57.270]  So I guess with that one, whoever owns that NFT is the authority that says, look,
[01:47:57.270 --> 01:48:04.470]  this cuts the real cut, because as you can see, I've got the NFT to back it up. As far as being
[01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:12.230]  able to actually truly link that cut to that NFT, that would be interesting how people do that.
[01:48:12.230 --> 01:48:18.630]  I've just sort of where my eye at the moment. I just know who owns which NFT. So they get access
[01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:25.110]  to my genetics as well as my inputs. And you're an honest guy. That's the key right now. You're
[01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:31.030]  an honest, you know, you're always going to people be dishonest people and you'll see where that
[01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:36.950]  comes from. Yeah, that's for sure. Hey, Bob, what happens if I lose my NFT?
[01:48:38.230 --> 01:48:43.270]  That's something I've been quite stressed out about, because not everyone understands that
[01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:48.150]  when you create a wallet, you've got like pass phrases and you've got to really keep that shit
[01:48:48.150 --> 01:48:53.990]  safe. You know, there's not a bank you can go to and say, yes, my thumbprint, I lost my bank card.
[01:48:53.990 --> 01:49:01.830]  If you lose that bank card, that's gone forever. Yes. So that's something I've thought about. I'm
[01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:08.230]  like, you know, this whole thing, it's a tradable asset. And that's what I've used it for within my
[01:49:08.230 --> 01:49:13.990]  business. But let's say, for instance, one of the guys that bought one of them loses access to his
[01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:19.510]  wallet. And I make a web three thing on my website when I have that up and running again, where they
[01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:25.350]  log in with their NFT wallet and it can see that they've got the noble genetics membership token.
[01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:30.950]  So it then gives them access to the shop and the store and all that shit. Now, what happens if that
[01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:37.910]  dude loses his wallet or his access to his wallet or for whatever reason, he doesn't have access to
[01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:45.670]  that NFT? I guess because it's a smaller business, I could from like man to man or man to woman,
[01:49:45.670 --> 01:49:50.790]  I could believe that they own that NFT. And up until someone else comes and says they sold it to
[01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:56.950]  them and they own it and can prove it. I would take it at that person's word that they the current
[01:49:56.950 --> 01:50:04.710]  owner of it. But if they actually lost access to it and that sort of real world utility of them
[01:50:04.710 --> 01:50:10.070]  logging into my website and using it, I don't know what would happen in that sense, you know,
[01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:14.870]  because it's gone. I can't even recover that policy. You better write that policy on your
[01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:21.270]  NFTs like I am not responsible if you lose your wallet. That's for sure, man. I made everyone I
[01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:25.190]  made it very clear to everyone because there are some guys that had bought the membership
[01:50:25.190 --> 01:50:29.670]  before I did the NFTs. So I gave them free NFTs and I just made it clear to them, look,
[01:50:30.230 --> 01:50:33.750]  make sure these are safe. Keep it written down somewhere.
[01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:38.150]  Because it's just a series of like 30 keys or numbers and letters.
[01:50:38.150 --> 01:50:44.710]  Yeah, it's 12 or 24 words. And that's pretty much. Yeah, that's your key to your bank account.
[01:50:45.670 --> 01:50:51.030]  And you can type that in on any device around the world. And if there's as long as there's
[01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:57.030]  network connection, your cryptocurrency and tokens would be on that device.
[01:50:57.910 --> 01:50:59.910]  So people see it as your name.
[01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:09.030]  Yeah. So people you get most the wallets or you can see the address as well as what's in it.
[01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:13.430]  Um, but people don't see the owner's name or anything like that.
[01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:17.830]  You'd have to know the person's address to actually go look it up.
[01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:25.750]  Because I created the collection. If you go into the marketplace, you can see that my name's there
[01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:32.150]  and you can see which NFTs are owned. That's on the Solana network and then also on the Ethereum
[01:51:32.150 --> 01:51:38.070]  network. I bought some back in there. I lost a good amount of money investing in some projects
[01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:42.870]  and I kicked myself because I invested in some random people over the Internet rather than myself.
[01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:50.070]  And I lost everything because they just man, they made their money and they decided that the plan
[01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:56.070]  they had was too big to succeed. So they washed their hands. They deleted the discord and they
[01:51:56.070 --> 01:52:02.470]  bolted with a couple of hundred thousand. And I kick myself to this day because I should have
[01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:10.950]  just invested that in myself rather than believing in other people. But that's, I guess
[01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:15.830]  that's the lesson in life. Rather focus on yourself, invest in yourself. And like you said the
[01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:22.230]  other day, pay yourself first. Yeah. Yeah. You're on it, man. Definitely. And man, I watched
[01:52:22.230 --> 01:52:26.870]  something the other day just to understand Bitcoin more and that blockchain. You know what I mean?
[01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:31.670]  And there was a huge heist on Bitcoin, you know, heist like that, you know, millions of,
[01:52:31.670 --> 01:52:39.830]  turned out to be like $4.1 billion. And it was this Mount Gox thing. Yeah. Which one did you say?
[01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:46.470]  It was like Mount Gox, G-O-X, M-T-O-X. No, it was this lady and this guy, this couple did it
[01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:53.670]  some years ago. Oh, Bitconnect. Yeah. That chick that had the YouTube channel was all, yeah, them.
[01:52:54.390 --> 01:53:00.870]  So the government was able to track that shit because of the blockchain is a record, like no
[01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:07.030]  matter if you steal the shit or not. So it was basically like them having a vault of gold that
[01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:10.470]  everyone knew was sitting right there. They couldn't take it in the government, you know,
[01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:16.150]  no one could take it. So they can watch it. Yeah. They watch it all. So man, read up on it,
[01:53:16.150 --> 01:53:20.870]  on Bitcoin. It's an interesting kind of the way the blockchain is and the way you explained it
[01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:28.310]  was really good. It kind of made me think about that. Yeah. I've been into Bitcoin since back in
[01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:34.470]  like back in probably 2012, 2013, where the only place you saw it was on the dark web and you could
[01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:40.230]  hire hackers and hit men for the shit. And people don't know back then your Bitcoin was like linked
[01:53:40.230 --> 01:53:46.390]  to a kilo of Coke, man. Like as that price went up or down on the black market, the price of Bitcoin
[01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:52.470]  went up or down. Because what could you get for Bitcoin? It was guns and drugs, you know.
[01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:58.950]  It's been interesting watching it get into the whole society and watch the sheeple of the world
[01:53:59.670 --> 01:54:03.670]  act like they're getting ripped off when they just wanted to get rich quick scheme.
[01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:07.830]  That's all they want. And then knowing the government can just go in there and
[01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:13.750]  track it kind of takes away from the to me. Yeah, it's scary, man. There's some that are
[01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:18.950]  more private. There's one called Monero that their sole purpose was a private blockchain.
[01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:24.550]  So secure and everything, but you can't go into it and look at someone else's wallet.
[01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:31.350]  And so for the more gray area people, they were trying to target that sort of thing. But the
[01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:37.510]  technology is inevitable, man. I think it's the next Internet. It's everything Internet couldn't
[01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:45.510]  be. So what do you think about Hex or Ethereum? I got some friends that were talking to me about
[01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:53.910]  investing in that. I think Ethereum is a real solid one. It's been the main back runner to Bitcoin
[01:54:54.630 --> 01:55:00.150]  and it allowed for a lot of other things. So Ethereum is what allowed for NFTs to happen
[01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:06.070]  because it allowed people to create their own custom tokens using the blockchain. So you didn't
[01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:12.230]  have to use the Ethereum token. You could create your own ones. And people have sort of ran with
[01:55:12.230 --> 01:55:18.550]  that. But man, the space is so wild. There's so many coins being released and different technologies
[01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:23.350]  being released. It's hard to try and predict which is going to be the front runner.
[01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:31.990]  I like one called Solana. It also allows for NFTs. It allows for crypto and it's got a
[01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:39.030]  transaction speed that's way faster than any of the other networks. There's some concern that
[01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:45.910]  they've sacrificed security for speed. But they've got faster speeds than some of these card
[01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:51.110]  processors, the international card processors. So they're trying to be the front runner of the real
[01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:57.350]  world usability of it. You can't always wait 10 minutes, 20 minutes when you're buying your coffee
[01:55:57.350 --> 01:56:03.510]  if you're using crypto. Whereas some of these ones, they're trying to be that. So it's sort of the
[01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:09.270]  best of both worlds. So speed is one of the factors if you're doing your research to figure
[01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:17.590]  out who's the front runner. Transaction speed. Back in the day, Bitcoin used to be real quick,
[01:56:17.590 --> 01:56:24.550]  man. You could send shit anywhere around the world and it was so fast. And then I was mining it back
[01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:33.590]  in 2017. There was a nice spike in the value. 2017 was one of the biggest jumps and I was mining
[01:56:33.590 --> 01:56:40.470]  it back then. But it almost became unusable. Too many people flooded the network. So you went from
[01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:45.830]  a transaction speed of a couple seconds and it only costing you a couple dollars to send
[01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:52.710]  the money to it costing you tens to hundreds of dollars to send it. And it's still taking half an
[01:56:52.710 --> 01:56:58.550]  hour, an hour, sometimes longer. And that's just because the technology didn't have that ability
[01:56:58.550 --> 01:57:04.070]  to scale up. So a lot of these other coins that have come after them, I think they call them
[01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:10.710]  second generation or third generation coins. They've addressed that issue where you can scale
[01:57:10.710 --> 01:57:16.790]  up without losing that usability and speed of an efficient network.
[01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:18.630]  Interesting.
[01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:29.670]  Do you think that since the government seized the John Robert, what was his name? The Silk Road guy,
[01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:32.230]  he went by like John Robert Pirate or something like that.
[01:57:34.390 --> 01:57:35.670]  Yeah. Silk Road. Yeah.
[01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:38.950]  Not sure of his name, but I'm aware of the Silk Road.
[01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:44.470]  Yeah. He had like John Roberts or something. That's not right. But it was something close to
[01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:50.550]  that where he then, the reason why he got caught is he used his real name and some kind of email
[01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:59.990]  thing. And I was wondering if the government doesn't see Bitcoin as a currency, then why
[01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:07.590]  would they seize it? And supposedly they seized all of that gentleman's Bitcoin, which outside of
[01:58:07.670 --> 01:58:15.350]  the Winkledorf twins, he was up there as one of the major holders of Bitcoin in the early days.
[01:58:16.630 --> 01:58:17.830]  Because it's currency.
[01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:25.670]  Yeah, man. If you can get something for it, it holds value. A lot of people say that it doesn't
[01:58:25.670 --> 01:58:32.710]  have any intrinsic value. I don't think any of our currency we use these days has intrinsic value,
[01:58:32.710 --> 01:58:38.790]  man. We went off the gold standard a while ago. So as long as you can get something for the coins,
[01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:44.070]  it's got value in it, man. And I think governments always, they don't mind a little bit of shady
[01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:47.430]  currency they can use for their under the table dealings.
[01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:53.350]  That's where I was going with that. So do you think that they're now able to move that stuff
[01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:58.550]  around? And it obviously holds certain value some days and stuff. It's pretty volatile,
[01:58:58.550 --> 01:59:04.550]  it seems like. But they're able to release those coins into the market without anybody
[01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:08.630]  realizing that those are John Roberts coins? No.
[01:59:08.630 --> 01:59:15.670]  You can always see where it was. So that's one of the best things about using the technology
[01:59:15.670 --> 01:59:23.510]  for these NFTs is there's that traceability and accountability. You can't fake the system.
[01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:28.630]  So once you've got those coins, you get launders and stuff like that. The same with normal cash.
[01:59:30.390 --> 01:59:34.870]  So I guess they could run it through enough accounts that it's not worth someone going
[01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:41.830]  to trace all these different accounts. You send something through enough accounts,
[01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:48.230]  it's hard to trace it. I do some offshore websites like that. So you just send the crypto
[01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:53.350]  to a couple of different addresses and it makes it just difficult if someone did want to follow
[01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:58.630]  the trail. I'm sure it happens with normal currency. You send it through a bunch of shell
[01:59:58.630 --> 02:00:04.150]  companies. It's the same idea, I guess. You got to have resources like a government
[02:00:04.150 --> 02:00:08.950]  though, Brian, to be able to do all that tracing. For the amount of money that we have on this call,
[02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:14.550]  the government's not going to do that work to go do the steps it takes. Because when they were
[02:00:14.630 --> 02:00:20.310]  showing it on how they caught these folks, they had shell company sold to this, sold to that.
[02:00:20.310 --> 02:00:25.510]  It's so many layers and they cracked each layer by just the number in the blockchain. They found
[02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:29.750]  out, oh, who owns that number? It's this fake name. They went and they found that fake name
[02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:34.870]  somewhere else. Then they found the fake name tied to an email, then the email tied back to
[02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:40.310]  a real person. So there is so many steps that it takes. There's always going to be that breadcrumb
[02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:46.710]  somewhere along the way. It seems like it's an email. That's what slips up all these.
[02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:51.510]  You got to be a genius to run Silk Road and then to trip up over an email
[02:00:52.150 --> 02:00:55.430]  where you used his real name. That was the thing, he used his real name.
[02:00:57.030 --> 02:01:01.110]  Yeah, man, it'll be that one time you needed to log in and you didn't want to do it properly
[02:01:01.110 --> 02:01:06.230]  because you were in a rush or something and you chose not to use the correct security stuff.
[02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:08.150]  And that's all they're going to get you.
[02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:16.310]  Only takes one little mistake, but they don't have to be right about once. You got to fuck
[02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:23.270]  up one good time. So I think you're teaching us some marketing stuff with this NFTs. Do you think
[02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:26.790]  there's value in that? If you're selling your seeds, obviously you're doing that.
[02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:35.670]  As long as they don't lose it, they obviously have it forever. As long as it's in the app,
[02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:38.790]  if they lose their password, it's fucked.
[02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:47.670]  You've got an offline key for your NFT wallets. So you can sign in on an app and then you can
[02:01:47.670 --> 02:01:54.310]  view your NFTs or log into a website with it. But as long as you've got those 12 words,
[02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:59.750]  it's called the private key or private passphrase. As long as you've got those 12 words somewhere
[02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:07.270]  and the blockchain technology doesn't fail, which I doubt it would, you can type those in anywhere
[02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:13.110]  and you've got access to those NFTs. And some of the guys that have bought those higher end ones,
[02:02:13.110 --> 02:02:17.670]  they've also bought one of the cheaper ones. So they want to obviously flip that later down the
[02:02:17.670 --> 02:02:24.070]  line. So if they wanted to flip that, they would need access to it. But if they just plan to hold
[02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:29.350]  it for the rest of their life and just get the benefits of getting my seeds, either if they've
[02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:34.870]  got the right membership for free or with the monthly memberships, then I guess they wouldn't
[02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:40.790]  need to have access to the NFT. But if they plan to sell it or flip it one day, that would come in
[02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:45.590]  handy. But yeah, I feel like it's great. So the wallet becomes currency in a way.
[02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:52.710]  Yeah, your access to your wallet is important. And if they ever needed to prove it. So for
[02:02:52.710 --> 02:02:59.110]  instance, I'm planning to have some events down the line. They would get free access to those
[02:02:59.110 --> 02:03:04.630]  events because they own the NFTs of the brand. So they would need to then show the NFT on entrance.
[02:03:05.190 --> 02:03:11.430]  So they would need to have access to that. But I think it's a great tool for any brand to utilize,
[02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:18.230]  you know, to give back a little bit to people that support your brand. Whether it's ticket stubs,
[02:03:18.230 --> 02:03:23.270]  instead of having ticket stubs at an event, you've got NFTs to say, look, I went to this event
[02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:28.790]  and you've got an NFT for that event. On a smaller scale, you know, for like some something
[02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:35.510]  like our types of business, you do a limited one where if they buy this, then maybe they'll get
[02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:42.470]  a free pack of the first thing at a conference. Or they get discount on any sales if they own
[02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:48.870]  one of your brands, NFTs. And I think in the next five to 10 years, most businesses or brands are
[02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:54.310]  going to have something to do with the blockchain or NFT technology. Man, I can even see down the
[02:03:54.310 --> 02:04:00.870]  line people having their metric certificates and varsity degrees and shit as NFTs just because of
[02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:07.510]  the traceability and accountability of it. You know, it's so secure. You can really check where
[02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:11.910]  those assets have been. And the art industry is just blown up with the shit, you know.
[02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:17.030]  Yeah, I forgot who it was recently. Somebody lost a lot of money.
[02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:22.550]  So like I think one of the somebody famous, I forget the chat probably heard it, but
[02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:28.070]  somebody lost like a couple million buying some art on NFT and then the value drops.
[02:04:29.190 --> 02:04:36.630]  Yeah, Logan Paul. Logan Paul. Yeah, he bought some. He posted one the other day and he said
[02:04:36.630 --> 02:04:40.710]  it's worth $10 and he got it, I think, for a couple of hundred thousand dollars.
[02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:48.710]  So the whole that side of the industry is really tanking and it's causing a lot of people to be
[02:04:48.710 --> 02:04:54.390]  like, you see, it's not worth anything. But it's because when the market was booming, I mean, when
[02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:59.590]  I invested in some of the projects I invested in start of this year, most have tanked. There's one
[02:04:59.590 --> 02:05:05.750]  that they plan to release a metaverse and they seem to still be going at it and they're holding
[02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:11.030]  strong despite the market tanking. But there were so many collections that had no substance.
[02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:17.030]  So when I looked into them, you know, they've got a collection of 10,000 bloody pieces and the whole
[02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:22.790]  business project or brand project is about selling the whole collection and then doing giveaways and
[02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:28.310]  then selling another collection and doing giveaways. It wasn't a sustainable business approach. You
[02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:33.190]  know, everyone was trying to get rich quick. And so all those sorts of projects are tanking.
[02:05:33.590 --> 02:05:38.790]  There's some of the bigger ones like the board apes that are still doing really well and selling
[02:05:38.790 --> 02:05:44.790]  for a good amount. I'm not sure if you guys have heard of Gary Vee, but he's been someone that's
[02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:50.710]  really been quite inspiring with business and marketing and all that shit. He did a collection
[02:05:50.710 --> 02:05:56.390]  of cartoons that he had hand drawn called Vee Friends. And they've just closed the deal with
[02:05:56.390 --> 02:06:03.110]  Toys R Us and Macy's and his like NFTs are going into soft toys and plush toys going into the
[02:06:03.190 --> 02:06:10.710]  stores. So, you know, it's going to pop off. It's just a matter of time. But a lot of people
[02:06:10.710 --> 02:06:17.830]  did lose a shitload of money. I won't lie. One thing I like about Gary Vee is he showed how you
[02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:23.430]  could flip things even at yard sales and stuff. So if you have no money in your pocket, you should
[02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:29.670]  check out his videos on that. I thought that was pretty awe inspiring to go to someplace,
[02:06:29.670 --> 02:06:32.550]  buy something for 50 cents, sell it on eBay for 50 bucks.
[02:06:33.110 --> 02:06:37.350]  I like selling up where they start with a dollar and kind of just end up with like a
[02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:41.910]  two thousand dollar item or something at the end of the day. Just trading up.
[02:06:42.550 --> 02:06:46.790]  And he has this dude following him around. So, you know, you literally just have a couple
[02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:51.190]  hundred bucks in your pocket. I would watch that. I think that might be the quickest way for you to
[02:06:51.190 --> 02:06:56.710]  get a couple thousand in your pocket. Yeah, man. He's very inspirational. That's for sure, man.
[02:06:57.670 --> 02:07:02.710]  He's everything from what we're discussing now, the marketing and branding. He really
[02:07:02.710 --> 02:07:08.550]  fucking knocked that out the park. But also that just that hustle and the grind. He teaches,
[02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:13.830]  you know, it's about the long game. He didn't mind spending 20, 30 years working for his dad
[02:07:13.830 --> 02:07:19.830]  till he was able to set him up properly before he focused on his own brand. You've got to be able to
[02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:24.790]  go through that grind to be a true entrepreneur. You know, you've got to be a cold blooded
[02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:32.310]  entrepreneur. But yeah, he did that whole flipping trading cards and mugs and shit like
[02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:35.510]  that's true hustler shit, man. You can buy for cheap, sell for lots.
[02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:43.430]  Sure. That's all I do. I just when I'm looking around for stuff, you know, but I just have a
[02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:48.950]  bigger mindset because I have equipment to be able to handle it like, you know, tanks and stuff like
[02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:53.670]  that that might be trash to somebody. You can handle it. So now it becomes worth money. So,
[02:07:53.670 --> 02:07:58.950]  yeah, definitely. Just hustling. I like that, man. There's no reason for anybody to be walking
[02:07:58.950 --> 02:08:04.310]  around broke, man. Like, you know, I mean, I think you got to really be determined,
[02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:07.830]  but it takes time and effort to do it. You know what I mean?
[02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:14.950]  But it happens sometimes. I mean, I'm quite small scale. So I've got a very small client base.
[02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:22.870]  And I've always almost taken pride in that because I can personally help each person. I do
[02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:29.110]  everything from the harvest to the trim to sending it out. But recently I had a really rough month,
[02:08:29.110 --> 02:08:34.470]  man, where I couldn't pay rent or buy food. And thanks to family and friends, they really helped
[02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:41.830]  me get through the month. But when you're quite small scale, sometimes you just have to be broke,
[02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:45.750]  even if you're busy hustling. And it's that grind, that determination.
[02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:53.030]  I was even saying to someone earlier, it was almost like a test.
[02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:57.270]  You had to have been broke before you get money, for sure. And you had to know those
[02:08:57.270 --> 02:09:02.310]  struggles of shit getting cut off and stuff like that. I feel you on that. Maybe, you know,
[02:09:03.110 --> 02:09:08.950]  it's all about time, you know, diversifying those streams too. It's tough if that one stream dries
[02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:13.990]  up, you got a little bit on the side to kind of keep you going. That's always helpful, man. That's
[02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:19.990]  where Brian took a piece of the soil food where I kind of made his business. You don't have to
[02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:25.830]  have the whole bite, not the whole cannabis, just take a part of it. You can diversify and maybe add
[02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:33.030]  to it with your inputs and stuff like that too. Yeah. I think, Bob, right now, if money troubles
[02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:39.030]  are your issue, you got to build what they call the runway so that your plane can continue to land
[02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:45.270]  if it needs to, but you have enough money so that you can continue to move out. And there's something
[02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:50.790]  about it, like kind of muddies the mind. I think you're not going to be as creative and stuff if
[02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:55.030]  you're on that level. And I've definitely been through that, man. I've shared that stuff. Even
[02:09:55.030 --> 02:10:00.790]  when I was growing up, I even had Marco's homie create something that I have a hoodie that I'm
[02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:06.150]  going to be coming out where all the proceeds will go to my wife's charity. But I want to put out
[02:10:06.150 --> 02:10:10.790]  there that it came from sugar water and mayonnaise sandwiches sometimes, not all the time,
[02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:17.110]  but sometimes eating that stuff, it kind of allows you to remember or that nostalgia of, man,
[02:10:18.150 --> 02:10:27.270]  it used to be a lot worse. Yeah, man. And money is kind of like that necessary evil. But when you
[02:10:27.270 --> 02:10:32.950]  have enough of it, in a weird way, it allows you to help others. You're able to, like your family,
[02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:39.670]  like just kind of like, man, what's the way I want to, I'm having trouble with my words because I
[02:10:39.670 --> 02:10:44.470]  want it to be a little more than just like, you got to save up a little bit of money. I mean,
[02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:52.070]  it gives you the freedom that you need to be an entrepreneur. Like if you don't have that runway,
[02:10:52.070 --> 02:10:56.390]  man, you're so focused on all this other stuff that you're going to end up having this like
[02:10:56.390 --> 02:11:01.030]  catch 22 type thing where you end up burning your wheels for months because you don't have enough
[02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:05.910]  income, but you don't have enough time in the day to really think things through and be creative
[02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:12.150]  and network and all of that stuff. So a broke entrepreneur, those can't be in the same sentence.
[02:11:12.150 --> 02:11:18.710]  And I know that a lot of people feel that way. But even Gary V, I think that even why part of that
[02:11:18.710 --> 02:11:22.870]  whole little process he was showing is that you got to get a little money in your pocket because
[02:11:23.830 --> 02:11:31.190]  that is the necessary evil. And there's, what's the Dave Ramsey. So if you listen to that gentleman,
[02:11:31.190 --> 02:11:36.230]  he talks about having like three months of rent, like minimum or mortgage or wherever you're at
[02:11:36.230 --> 02:11:39.670]  in life. And I think there's a lot of things that we've missed.
[02:11:39.670 --> 02:11:44.630]  Yeah, I love that when you said you paid your rent. I love it when you said you paid your rent up front, man. That was so inspirational.
[02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:50.630]  Well, I shared that because, and my wife got a little mad at me for that, to be honest.
[02:11:51.590 --> 02:11:56.870]  I shared that because I want you guys to see that there's receipts to it. And then when you do have
[02:11:56.870 --> 02:12:01.990]  income, how do you spend that? If I was in my early twenties, I wouldn't have done that.
[02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:05.910]  You know what I mean? And so that's what I want to share with the younger audience is like, you got
[02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:11.270]  to get your shit all lined up. If you're riding around, you got your fancy jewels and all that
[02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:15.110]  stuff, which is important when you're young, especially if you're in the gray market, I feel
[02:12:15.110 --> 02:12:20.150]  like people judge you on that. They want their weed dealer to look successful. But when you start to
[02:12:20.150 --> 02:12:25.110]  get older, nobody really gives a fuck about that anymore. And as you get older, I think if you are
[02:12:25.110 --> 02:12:29.750]  in a nicer neighborhood, everybody has that shit. So nobody gives a fuck either way. So you got to
[02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:35.190]  really kind of focus on the runway of life and the stresses of life. And so many people are trying to
[02:12:35.190 --> 02:12:40.710]  keep up with the Joneses. I met a guy this past weekend where he was talking to me about,
[02:12:40.710 --> 02:12:46.470]  he has his high-end car, but he makes 15 bucks an hour. I was like, dude, you got to get rid of
[02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:51.430]  the fucking car. And you can see on his face that he wasn't, like, that's a hard pill to swallow.
[02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:52.790]  You got to make more income.
[02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:57.590]  Yeah. You got to scale down, drive the beater dog. And then you can get back to where it's,
[02:12:57.590 --> 02:13:02.790]  otherwise you're going to spin your wheels. Cause he's at the same shows I'm at, but he doesn't
[02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:08.790]  have the same time I got. And that's the real difference that I see live in action is that my
[02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:14.950]  wife and I devote 24 seven to our business now. And we are a lightning speed compared to other
[02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:20.470]  people. And if you don't have that, you're going to be behind. And so putting all your time and
[02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:25.190]  effort has to come with the fact that you also have a little bit of money tucked away. So you
[02:13:25.190 --> 02:13:31.510]  don't have those stresses because I had a lot of money stresses in my life, dude, growing up and
[02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:37.110]  then making the wrong decisions. Again, putting your faith in others, not believing in yourself.
[02:13:37.110 --> 02:13:41.670]  And that's the one thing I want to give to you, buddy, is that you're now refocused on yourself.
[02:13:41.670 --> 02:13:46.230]  And that's why I wanted to highlight you today is because I commend that, man, you got all these
[02:13:46.230 --> 02:13:50.870]  other variables that could fuck your shit up, but you're still at the end of the day, you're true to
[02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:55.110]  who you are. I heard you say several times that like, I don't want to put genetics out. Cause I
[02:13:55.110 --> 02:13:59.590]  don't want the market to be like, yo, this is bullshit. I've probably heard maybe one out of
[02:13:59.590 --> 02:14:04.470]  10, maybe two out of 10 breeders ever even say that. So there's something to you, man, about
[02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:09.590]  being authentic. I think that's also something that comes across in whatever we always joke
[02:14:09.590 --> 02:14:13.830]  about teapots. If you're just authentic in the way you're selling your teapots, people are going
[02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:20.470]  to want to rock with you. So the product that we sell as a community, whatever you choose,
[02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:25.510]  I don't think that necessarily matters as much. It's just finding something that you believe in,
[02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:30.150]  that you're passionate about. And as long as you are where you get up every morning and say,
[02:14:30.150 --> 02:14:35.910]  I can do this because you got to do something, right? You have to make something or sell something,
[02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:40.390]  you got to get up and do something with your life. And that's hard.
[02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:44.870]  You got to provide to society, man. You've got to give something back.
[02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:50.150]  And I loved what you said about the runway, brother. I've often thought like,
[02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:55.990]  when I hit a wobble back in 2018, I had a mental breakdown. I left the career I was in.
[02:14:57.190 --> 02:15:01.590]  I often used to tell myself, I need to get myself back on track, man. I need to get myself back on
[02:15:01.590 --> 02:15:06.310]  track. And a friend of mine messaged me and he said, stop saying this shit, man, because you're
[02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:13.670]  not a train. You're meant to fly. But planes themselves need a bit of runway. So you need that
[02:15:13.670 --> 02:15:19.990]  time and space to be allowed to take off. So one of the questions I actually had was, how do you
[02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:25.830]  balance the long-term goals with the current survival? Because I find sometimes that current
[02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:33.590]  survival almost hinders that bigger picture. And you've got to sometimes do that little hustle and
[02:15:33.590 --> 02:15:39.430]  that grind in the short term. Maybe drop the prices of the extracts. That's something I've
[02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:45.030]  been having to do recently. Even though I know it's high-end shit, money in the bank's better
[02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:54.090]  than product in the cupboard. Man, I don't know if I agree with that, to be honest with you, bud.
[02:15:54.090 --> 02:15:56.650]  Don't you? I wanted to hear your thoughts on that.
[02:15:56.650 --> 02:16:01.530]  I don't want too much inventory now. You don't want all your money sitting on the shelf.
[02:16:01.530 --> 02:16:07.370]  What he said there is definitely true. If you've got a product, you've got teapots,
[02:16:07.370 --> 02:16:10.490]  what good are teapots sitting in your cupboard if they're not selling?
[02:16:11.370 --> 02:16:19.450]  But what if your teapots are gold-plated and people just not seeing the gold?
[02:16:20.410 --> 02:16:28.010]  Well, you made too many teapots. You can't make more teapots than you can sell, bro.
[02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:32.250]  If that's the case, you've got to diversify and get another stream of income. It can't just be
[02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:39.130]  teapots. That's the only thing I work on. I'll second that part. There are certain brands out
[02:16:39.130 --> 02:16:46.650]  there, you usually see it more in the designer world. They don't go on sale. If I was deep into
[02:16:46.650 --> 02:16:52.890]  this cannabis spot still, that would be more of my focus as a brand if I was thinking long term.
[02:16:53.690 --> 02:17:00.810]  But that's not necessarily viable for most. So I think that when you're talking small time,
[02:17:00.810 --> 02:17:08.010]  farm, craft, you've got to focus on all of your strengths and continue to build those things up.
[02:17:08.010 --> 02:17:16.570]  I think jumping on the bandwagon of trying to grow too quickly is the downfall of a lot
[02:17:16.570 --> 02:17:23.290]  of entrepreneurs, even stable entrepreneurs. I've seen a few documentaries as well. I like to watch,
[02:17:23.290 --> 02:17:26.970]  obviously, I probably talk about that too much. But I think documentaries are fantastic because
[02:17:26.970 --> 02:17:32.730]  you learn about it 30 minutes an hour. Well, anyway, a lot of individuals, they'll be successful
[02:17:32.730 --> 02:17:36.810]  with one restaurant and then they'll open up another restaurant and it's just too much.
[02:17:36.810 --> 02:17:41.130]  And then both restaurants fail. And I've seen that in cannabis too, where people are like,
[02:17:41.130 --> 02:17:45.370]  okay, I got to be vertically integrated. So I got my grow up. Now I got my dispensary up. And
[02:17:45.370 --> 02:17:49.770]  they've never even been in the cannabis space before. So they're relying on all of these people.
[02:17:49.770 --> 02:17:56.330]  And let's be honest with everybody, the turnover in cannabis in industry is traumatic. I mean,
[02:17:56.890 --> 02:18:00.810]  you dangle the shiniest little thing and people run to the next. I mean, there's,
[02:18:01.450 --> 02:18:06.650]  especially in like the trimmers and that kind of stuff. So there's just a lot of overhead that I
[02:18:06.650 --> 02:18:11.290]  don't think the suits think about that the hoodies have experienced where it's going to be pretty
[02:18:11.290 --> 02:18:15.930]  hard to keep people here working for us when we treat them like shit and we pay them hardly
[02:18:15.930 --> 02:18:22.170]  anything. And the ones that read the books, they don't feel that way. So when you're a small time
[02:18:22.170 --> 02:18:26.730]  like you are, Bob, you don't have to worry about all that shit, man. You're just focused on quality.
[02:18:26.730 --> 02:18:30.810]  And I think because you understand NFTs and all of this kind of stuff that I don't, I mean,
[02:18:31.530 --> 02:18:36.330]  I enjoyed listening to you explain that because I had part of my wheels spinning and stuff.
[02:18:36.890 --> 02:18:43.050]  But the focus that you're on quality, dropping down your concentrates, pricing, I would only
[02:18:43.050 --> 02:18:48.410]  maybe do that a couple times. Like my company, I was talking to my wife, we only do that on Black
[02:18:48.410 --> 02:18:53.690]  Friday, Cyber Monday. That's it. You know, you got to come to the expo's if you want to get a
[02:18:53.690 --> 02:18:58.650]  lower price. And I think that allows people to see that you have a quality brand and you're not
[02:18:58.650 --> 02:19:02.810]  going to, you're not going to, you know, bend down to the market saying like, all right, I'm just
[02:19:02.810 --> 02:19:06.970]  going to the race to the bottom. And I think a lot of other cannabis brands, if they would
[02:19:06.970 --> 02:19:11.050]  actually listen to some of that advice back in the day, they would be ahead of the game instead
[02:19:11.050 --> 02:19:14.410]  of being like, all right, we've got to get four pounds light. They're saying three pounds light.
[02:19:14.410 --> 02:19:17.930]  We've got to get four pounds of light. Well, they didn't understand what that meant.
[02:19:20.490 --> 02:19:24.410]  Yeah, I definitely don't. I definitely don't like dropping the value of my brand
[02:19:25.210 --> 02:19:31.370]  because I feel I've spent the last three, four years establishing myself as that sort of higher
[02:19:31.450 --> 02:19:38.250]  end of the spectrum, you know, always going for the highest quality regardless of
[02:19:38.810 --> 02:19:48.650]  outside circumstance. But when sales and clients have been as low and slow as they have been,
[02:19:49.610 --> 02:19:55.450]  I find I need to get more reach. And whenever people get my extract of flower into their hands,
[02:19:55.450 --> 02:20:00.090]  they really love it. I've always had great feedback. And it's silly. Some of the people
[02:20:00.090 --> 02:20:06.330]  that have had the extracts have actually told me to raise the pricing. And I always laugh at that,
[02:20:06.330 --> 02:20:12.170]  man, because it's what it's worth. And I guess when you tell people what it's worth, that's what
[02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:18.490]  it is, you know. But there's so many that that's above their price range. I mean, we're going
[02:20:18.490 --> 02:20:23.450]  through a bit of a financial thing at the moment. I'm pretty sure there's a global recession
[02:20:23.450 --> 02:20:30.010]  happening. So there's not many people that are able to hit that higher end of the spectrum. You
[02:20:30.010 --> 02:20:35.210]  know, I enjoy nice things in life, but I don't think if I was a consumer, I would be able to
[02:20:35.210 --> 02:20:42.170]  afford my concentrates. And it's not that they're overpriced. It's just they're out of budget,
[02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:47.370]  you know. You might be too Louis Vuitton for your neighborhood, you know what I mean?
[02:20:47.370 --> 02:20:49.050]  And so when you're like that.
[02:20:49.050 --> 02:20:49.610]  I've got a national.
[02:20:49.610 --> 02:20:51.610]  Go into the city with you, Louis Vuitton.
[02:20:51.610 --> 02:20:57.770]  Yeah, but let me finish my point. But when you're like that, you either have to don't make as much
[02:20:57.770 --> 02:21:02.570]  product or, yeah, now that you've said it, I'm going to steal yours, Brian, or take it to where
[02:21:02.570 --> 02:21:07.050]  they want that Louis, you know what I mean? You got to go either one. My question to you,
[02:21:07.050 --> 02:21:13.610]  and this is just something to reflect on possibly, you're a young man. You said you were in the drone
[02:21:13.610 --> 02:21:19.130]  industry, not getting into that. But I always say you've got to have that main income, even if
[02:21:19.130 --> 02:21:24.810]  you're a hustler. All the best hustlers had that gig, had that job, had that income, whatever you
[02:21:24.810 --> 02:21:30.570]  call it from that, you know, parallel to hustling until they got to the point where they didn't no
[02:21:30.570 --> 02:21:36.650]  longer needed that. So to me, like, are you at the point where you're maxed out at your time?
[02:21:36.650 --> 02:21:41.930]  Or could you pick on, pick up and kind of get some more streams and diversify,
[02:21:41.930 --> 02:21:47.450]  do something totally opposite of this, you know, to bring in some extra money as well? Because
[02:21:47.450 --> 02:21:52.650]  I'll tell you what, man, a lot of people don't understand a lot of the Bitcoin and things like
[02:21:52.650 --> 02:21:59.130]  that, but they want to, you know, so just throwing that out. Thanks, man. Yeah, I left the drone
[02:21:59.130 --> 02:22:05.450]  industry. I was building some high end security drones, sometimes worth up to half a million.
[02:22:05.850 --> 02:22:13.210]  So it became quite stressful and I had a mental breakdown. So I burnt those bridges quite well.
[02:22:14.250 --> 02:22:21.290]  But I have like always thought about a secondary income to supplement things. But time is pretty,
[02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:27.610]  pretty much spent at the end of the day when I'm doing all my things. So I'm just sort of
[02:22:27.610 --> 02:22:34.250]  hoping my baby takes off. But, you know, I've looked into doing the whole blockchain and NFT
[02:22:34.250 --> 02:22:38.490]  consulting because like you say, there are a lot of people interested in that sort of thing.
[02:22:39.770 --> 02:22:44.570]  But I feel that space is still quite early. There's not enough people really willing to
[02:22:44.570 --> 02:22:50.970]  take the dive and do it. So there's not too much to be made, I don't feel in that sense.
[02:22:52.730 --> 02:22:56.250]  Yeah, you're like, you're like not early, but you're at the point where like you're a little
[02:22:56.250 --> 02:23:00.970]  bit ahead of all of us, even with the NFTs, like you're cutting edge right now. So that's,
[02:23:00.970 --> 02:23:05.450]  that's wonderful. And being that way, that is going to make you have a little bit of growing
[02:23:05.450 --> 02:23:10.010]  pains because you're going to always kind of be a little bit ahead of that, the buyers market.
[02:23:10.010 --> 02:23:13.450]  Yeah, just just behind the crest of the wave, you know?
[02:23:13.450 --> 02:23:17.130]  Yeah, yeah. That's what I keep trying to mimic with my hands. Yeah, you're gonna be like right
[02:23:17.130 --> 02:23:22.490]  on the bow, you know what I mean? And that's wonderful. And like you said, you got to sustain
[02:23:22.490 --> 02:23:26.090]  it, you know what I mean? And be able to make it to the to ride that wave. So.
[02:23:27.050 --> 02:23:33.770]  That's where I've felt I've got to just sort of survive this initial uncomfortable phase.
[02:23:34.730 --> 02:23:41.130]  And I feel I've got the grit to do it. The work, it's coming along, you know, I might struggle.
[02:23:41.850 --> 02:23:48.090]  But in the last few months, despite the struggle, I've gone up a generation in a couple different
[02:23:48.090 --> 02:23:53.610]  lines. So as long as I can continue to do that, I've got written down here and my thing, the
[02:23:53.610 --> 02:23:58.490]  bigger picture, I know it's worth it, you know? So it's just a matter of how to buy enough time.
[02:23:59.290 --> 02:24:03.370]  All right. So then also, do you have that? Where do you see yourself, man? All right.
[02:24:03.370 --> 02:24:09.130]  The lines are stable. 10 years from now. What do you where do you see yourself? How do you see
[02:24:09.130 --> 02:24:15.770]  yourself moving in that situation? Man, that's quite something. I don't often think about that,
[02:24:15.770 --> 02:24:20.730]  but I don't know. I can see myself. You got to give a 10 year, five year, 10 year.
[02:24:21.050 --> 02:24:27.450]  Five year, 10 year. Yep. And then you're inside of each year. You can you can go a quarter ahead.
[02:24:27.450 --> 02:24:31.370]  What am I going to do next quarter? What am I going to next quarter? Stay a little bit ahead.
[02:24:31.370 --> 02:24:36.090]  That's just going to always keep you thinking ahead and on the focused on where you want to be,
[02:24:36.090 --> 02:24:44.010]  bro. Oh, I definitely need to put some more thought towards that. I see myself as a farmer,
[02:24:44.570 --> 02:24:48.890]  just out there with my plants, you know, my plants and my microbes.
[02:24:49.770 --> 02:24:56.550]  All right. That's what's up to put some more thought into us and try to smoke that dab tonight
[02:24:56.550 --> 02:25:00.630]  and just really go deep there. And where do you see yourself? You know, because that's a lot of
[02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:05.430]  yourself, man. Like I remember being young and I used to I was like, damn, man, you know, I'm ready
[02:25:05.430 --> 02:25:10.710]  for a woman. You know, you thought you're ready for that woman now and you get well, you get women,
[02:25:11.350 --> 02:25:16.630]  whoever brings you women in your life and then that's not the woman for you. So you got to be
[02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:20.710]  a little more specific. And that's why you got to kind of think, you know, kind of even write it out,
[02:25:20.710 --> 02:25:29.030]  man. Put it on paper. Yeah. Yeah, man, I moved to town with a woman recently. Well, for the last
[02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:34.070]  couple of years. And that's why I had to sort of downscale while I was living in town. That
[02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:38.950]  unfortunately ended quite badly at the start of the year. So I moved back to the farm. And that's
[02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:43.670]  why I think I've had this uncomfortable sort of phase because I've moved to a bigger property
[02:25:44.230 --> 02:25:52.470]  while the growth still had to sort of scale up from having been shut down. So it's a balancing
[02:25:52.470 --> 02:25:56.550]  act. But like you say, you've got to know what you want to be ready for it. And you always say
[02:25:56.550 --> 02:26:01.990]  you've got to be ready to jump when that opportunity knocks. I enjoy that you guys say, you know.
[02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:06.790]  When we're talking about scaling up and building a runway for yourself,
[02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:13.030]  it seems like people are receptive to some kind of monthly subscription from a small business part.
[02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:18.870]  That is sometimes the bloodline for certain businesses to build up that subscription base.
[02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:23.430]  Is that something that you think you could do fairly quickly, maybe going into the city once
[02:26:23.430 --> 02:26:28.950]  a week, once a month, whatever it is, and starting to focus on that so that you have that, you know,
[02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:32.630]  it's kind of like a job, if you will. Now, you know that there's a guaranteed income coming in
[02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:39.190]  so that you don't feel as stressed. That was the idea initially when I set up the genetics
[02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:44.550]  membership, when I realized that, you know, I'm quite addicted to making seeds, but it's not
[02:26:44.550 --> 02:26:50.950]  paying the bills. So I wanted to get that sort of residual income where I knew I had this sort of
[02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:58.790]  buffer zone every month. And I set my eyes on 10 people because I figured if I can get 10 people
[02:26:58.790 --> 02:27:05.750]  to give me like $20 a month, that's a nice buffer zone. And then they get free seeds every now and
[02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:13.590]  then, you know. But then what happened is I got a good sort of reception to the thing, but not as
[02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:21.510]  wide of an audience as I needed. And then what's happened in recent months, I only had a couple
[02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:26.950]  members, but they then hit their own financial troubles, you know. And when someone's messaging
[02:27:26.950 --> 02:27:32.310]  you saying they're having struggles, they can't pay school fees and shit, I can't expect them to
[02:27:32.310 --> 02:27:38.790]  just send me money so I can work on my seeds. But that subscription model is definitely one of my
[02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:46.070]  main sort of incomes, I think, till I get to the true F1s and the IBLs down the line, was that
[02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:52.310]  subscription model just to get that buffer zone. But building that up has been the trick. I haven't
[02:27:52.310 --> 02:27:59.350]  been able to sort of bridge that gap with people where they feel it's worth it almost. I feel
[02:27:59.350 --> 02:28:05.750]  financially it pays itself off, you know. The guys that have bought the memberships, they've got back
[02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:14.390]  their value tenfold. Be it in seeds, stickers, natural farming inputs. I send them my IMOs when
[02:28:14.390 --> 02:28:21.750]  I make them. So that subscription model is something I've been trying to do, but I've just not been able
[02:28:21.750 --> 02:28:28.310]  to hit enough people for it to be a sustainable sort of residual income. Have you thought about
[02:28:28.310 --> 02:28:32.950]  maybe creating a tiered subscription model where you can cater to the high-end people that would
[02:28:32.950 --> 02:28:41.030]  be willing to maybe get some of your concentrates shipped to you? So I do have that. So I actually
[02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:48.070]  do have that both with the genetics as well as the extracts. The genetics, there's different tiers on
[02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:54.390]  the membership and then based on the tier, they pay a certain amount and that then gives like,
[02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:59.670]  it determines what they have access to and how many seeds they get in their packs when I send
[02:28:59.670 --> 02:29:06.390]  packs out. The extracts, I've also created the membership tokens to that. And some of the more
[02:29:06.390 --> 02:29:13.430]  higher end ones receive free grams of the next like 10 or 20 batches of concentrates. The lower
[02:29:13.430 --> 02:29:19.910]  end ones would obviously just then provide the access to the concentrates. And once I've sold
[02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:25.110]  enough of those, it'll become sort of like an exclusive club. But at the moment it's open just
[02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:30.470]  because I haven't sold enough of those. But there is, I've sort of set that plan out. We have got
[02:29:30.470 --> 02:29:35.830]  various tiers to make it available for the different classes, both on the genetics and the
[02:29:35.830 --> 02:29:46.570]  extract side of things. Might have lost in there. That was pretty good. Could run on that one though.
[02:29:46.570 --> 02:29:51.930]  Yeah, it was a good little run. He's still there, but I think we've lost him. Yeah.
[02:29:51.930 --> 02:29:57.210]  He's loaded. Yeah, man. It's just a matter of buying time. Like I keep coming back.
[02:30:00.330 --> 02:30:05.690]  We should say they're tapping your phone when your phone did make that noise like that back in the
[02:30:05.690 --> 02:30:18.340]  day. I hope he'll come back on here. I think he's pretty close to kind of finding his own way, but
[02:30:19.140 --> 02:30:21.780]  you know, if you don't have the money for rent and stuff,
[02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:28.420]  well, you got to, you know, all your attention has got to be obviously changed and then you don't
[02:30:28.420 --> 02:30:34.740]  have enough time in the day, the week, the month to devote to your entrepreneurship. And so now
[02:30:34.740 --> 02:30:39.620]  you're a month behind now, two months behind. And I don't think enough people hold themselves
[02:30:39.620 --> 02:30:44.180]  accountable to that, Marco. Myself included when I first started. That's why I started really
[02:30:44.180 --> 02:30:48.420]  mentally doing the everyday counts kind of thing. Cause it is pretty easy when you're
[02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:54.740]  everyday man. Don't look past it because even like you got a vacation coming up or something,
[02:30:54.740 --> 02:30:58.740]  you don't, don't look past these days that lead up to it. Cause what will happen is you'll,
[02:30:58.740 --> 02:31:03.940]  you'll lose big chunks of your time, you know, things like that. That's living in every day,
[02:31:03.940 --> 02:31:10.900]  you know, which is pretty dope. So, man, he had a good run. We're getting close on you back, Bob,
[02:31:10.900 --> 02:31:17.460]  probably have some questions at the end, maybe. No, he's he's not. And actually we don't have
[02:31:17.460 --> 02:31:21.300]  really anything for questions. So he's at work two in the morning, one in the morning.
[02:31:23.220 --> 02:31:28.100]  Yeah. We appreciate that, man. But he was excited to ask you questions, Marco. And
[02:31:29.460 --> 02:31:34.500]  I think that was, maybe we should give it to the audience. I would like to do this again,
[02:31:34.500 --> 02:31:39.460]  especially for individuals that maybe are facing a lot of variables, maybe not just even just in
[02:31:39.460 --> 02:31:44.580]  America, but if you guys want to ask us real time stuff about your business, how to build that up,
[02:31:44.580 --> 02:31:49.220]  that interests you guys into like this kind of series, I want to, we want to bring cannabis and
[02:31:49.220 --> 02:31:54.820]  stuff, but I don't, I don't want our shows to be like one trick ponies either, where we're just
[02:31:56.180 --> 02:32:00.980]  videos, people, I don't want you guys to get tired of that stuff. And the only way to find
[02:32:00.980 --> 02:32:06.020]  success is to obviously have a variety of different skills. And part of that is marketing and branding.
[02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:11.140]  Thanks, man. Appreciate that. This was, I think this whole show is great. And I think we should
[02:32:11.140 --> 02:32:16.820]  do that, man. Spotlight businesses, man. I love it. It gives me chills because like this, he's
[02:32:16.820 --> 02:32:22.580]  very, Bob's very trash into it. You know, he's really kicking it off and I really like to see
[02:32:22.580 --> 02:32:27.380]  his growth, you know, in six months and a year and down the road. But if you guys know anybody
[02:32:27.380 --> 02:32:35.060]  or yourselves, and I think our guest coming on here soon, she is a good business as well.
[02:32:36.740 --> 02:32:41.220]  And yeah, man, it's all like, I feel like cannabis is already built in. All right. This is, this is
[02:32:41.220 --> 02:32:46.340]  what cannabis is, what we do like now we're, let's get deeper. Let's break it down into life. Like,
[02:32:46.340 --> 02:32:49.940]  you know, cannabis is already there and we're going to be talking about that.
[02:32:50.900 --> 02:32:56.740]  But to even bring in businesses and intermingle, man, that's, that's pretty cool, man. Try to help
[02:32:56.740 --> 02:33:01.460]  them get promoted. Well, you know how people always say like all boats rise, you know,
[02:33:01.460 --> 02:33:05.300]  there's certain groups where it's like, I want the receipts for that. You know,
[02:33:07.300 --> 02:33:12.820]  welcome back. Yeah. Sorry, man. Our power just cut. So I think our cell phone tower
[02:33:13.780 --> 02:33:19.780]  isn't giving as good of a signal. But I've managed to come back on. Let's see if that lasts.
[02:33:21.220 --> 02:33:25.380]  All right. We're going to probably get, we don't want to, we don't want to lose you without saying,
[02:33:25.380 --> 02:33:29.300]  you know, the final thoughts. So we should probably start getting towards that direction.
[02:33:30.180 --> 02:33:37.140]  Oh, sweet. So what, real quick, what are your easiest ways you think in your, you know,
[02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:41.300]  you own, you know, your own business better than anybody else that you could get a quicker runway
[02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:44.980]  where you don't have to feel like you have that huge boulder on your chest?
[02:33:47.220 --> 02:33:53.700]  Honestly, I think the best would be to get a couple more like regular clients for the
[02:33:54.660 --> 02:34:01.620]  concentrates and flour. Recently I have had some people purchase some of the greenhouse flour and
[02:34:01.620 --> 02:34:09.700]  they've really enjoyed it. So I'm hoping that that something comes of that. But yeah, probably maybe
[02:34:09.700 --> 02:34:17.060]  some more members for the genetics that could help. But that's not something that doesn't solve
[02:34:17.060 --> 02:34:22.580]  the whole problem, but it, they're both like extra members on the genetics end, as well as
[02:34:23.140 --> 02:34:28.820]  more everyday smokers. You know, if I had like five to 10 people really enjoying my concentrates
[02:34:28.820 --> 02:34:34.340]  and stuff, that solves all the problems. So it's just a matter of getting those people, I guess,
[02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:39.060]  getting it in, getting it in front of those people and in their lungs and allowing them to appreciate
[02:34:39.060 --> 02:34:44.660]  it. Definitely. What are y'all's numbers like over there? Like what's an ounce,
[02:34:45.380 --> 02:34:51.220]  go down. So flour will go for over there. Well, we don't work in ounces and all that. So let me ask.
[02:34:51.220 --> 02:34:59.860]  Yeah, we don't work in kilos. A kilo. So like I don't have that much, but a kilo would probably
[02:34:59.860 --> 02:35:09.780]  go for about, depending on the quality, anywhere from 20 to 60, 70,000 Rand. My sort of stuff
[02:35:10.340 --> 02:35:16.340]  for like a 10 gram bag, I usually sell it for 600 bucks. So that would be,
[02:35:17.460 --> 02:35:23.940]  what would that work out to be? Probably about $30, $30, $40 for 10 grams.
[02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:31.540]  That's a good deal though. Yeah, that's good. That's good work for them. Yeah. Especially at that
[02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:39.060]  low level of purchase. Maybe bump that up. Yeah, man. I think you're selling yourself maybe a little
[02:35:39.060 --> 02:35:42.820]  short here, especially if you have a customer telling you that they'd be willing to pay more.
[02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:47.300]  Maybe you just need to find those customers that are willing to pay extra. Like there are people
[02:35:47.300 --> 02:35:53.300]  out there that like quality and they have the means to pay for quality. You just got to find
[02:35:53.300 --> 02:36:05.530]  those individuals. You have the ability to go into the city. Go ahead, Bob. I think we lost his voice
[02:36:05.530 --> 02:36:11.690]  again. You got to find the people to sort from high to low dollar amount. You got one. As soon
[02:36:11.690 --> 02:36:15.850]  as they go to a site, they want to see the most expensive shit. Find the people. That's your
[02:36:15.850 --> 02:36:21.370]  people. People do it with the ISO file. They go right to the, they want to see the top dollar
[02:36:21.370 --> 02:36:27.610]  stuff. But you know, it's just how life is. Some people are like that. Pardon? There we go.
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:37.900]  Are you back, Bob? No, we lost your audio again, Bob.
[02:36:38.940 --> 02:36:43.420]  That might be hard if the electricity's out. Yeah, man. The fact that we even got him for
[02:36:43.420 --> 02:36:47.260]  two and a half hours is pretty dope, dude. Yeah, really? That was great, man.
[02:36:49.100 --> 02:36:52.940]  Yeah. So I guess hopefully he'll come back here in a second. But if you guys like this kind of
[02:36:52.940 --> 02:36:58.060]  series, I think this might be something where we can help the community spotlight on the community.
[02:36:58.860 --> 02:37:03.020]  Again, it needs to come from somebody that's genuine. You know, like when we've helped
[02:37:03.020 --> 02:37:07.420]  individuals, people have reached out to me just wanting like a free money grab that, to be honest,
[02:37:07.420 --> 02:37:13.260]  that shit pisses me off. Like, you know, we're not here just to help everybody that down on
[02:37:13.260 --> 02:37:17.900]  their luck. Like, you know, the point is, is that you find a way for yourself. I think that's the
[02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:24.140]  biggest gift anybody could ever give you is the ability to make your own money, your own way.
[02:37:24.140 --> 02:37:29.740]  Find your own way. Working for somebody else, obviously learning this later in life is complete
[02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:35.740]  bullshit, man. If you have that entrepreneur type mindset, and if you don't, then, you know,
[02:37:35.740 --> 02:37:40.620]  maybe not entrepreneurship is for you, but if you can handle a little bit of risk, calculated risk,
[02:37:41.340 --> 02:37:45.260]  this might be something for you. And this series might be something where we can really highlight
[02:37:45.260 --> 02:37:50.860]  that and talk deeper on this stuff, because a lot of us didn't graduate from college. We didn't take
[02:37:50.860 --> 02:37:55.660]  business classes. You know, we're learning this shit on the fly. Yeah. Sometimes you got to eat
[02:37:55.660 --> 02:38:00.940]  soup. Sometimes you just eat bread. You know what I mean? It's like, you know, it's not like I didn't
[02:38:00.940 --> 02:38:05.340]  pay rent. That rent's paid. Fuck everything else, because I'm going to have that roof over my head.
[02:38:05.740 --> 02:38:10.460]  Sometimes I had to eat soup. You know what I mean? So that's kind of the mindset. Like,
[02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:15.020]  you know, I love that. And it is good that you shared that with folks, Brian, because that just
[02:38:15.020 --> 02:38:19.340]  tells the importance. And you know the importance of having that roof over your head, man. That is
[02:38:19.340 --> 02:38:25.820]  your home. If nothing else, my family and myself, we're going to come up under this roof and we're
[02:38:25.820 --> 02:38:30.140]  going to be safe. You know what I mean? So that's very important, man. So taking care of priorities
[02:38:30.140 --> 02:38:35.580]  is number one. Where you sacrifice to me, like, and I'm sure Bob has done all these things,
[02:38:35.580 --> 02:38:39.660]  is you just kind of tighten your belt, man. You kind of, you can't go out. You can't go have that
[02:38:39.660 --> 02:38:44.220]  drink. You can't do kind of the extra stuff. You know what I mean? I can't go, guys. You know what
[02:38:44.220 --> 02:38:50.060]  I mean? Can't go. You know, so sometimes you just have to sit back, sit that one out. And I know a
[02:38:50.060 --> 02:38:55.020]  lot of our younger folks and, you know, FOMO, I don't want to miss out on nothing. You know what
[02:38:55.020 --> 02:39:01.180]  I mean? So don't be afraid to miss out, man. You know, be, you be a leader. No, I'm the leader of
[02:39:01.180 --> 02:39:06.540]  me. I'm not going, you know, don't worry about what everybody else is doing. So just those things,
[02:39:06.540 --> 02:39:13.020]  man, tightening up, man. I hope that he does get a little bit more action out of doing this show,
[02:39:13.020 --> 02:39:18.060]  man. And I think that obviously, or other opportunities, respect. Yeah, much respect to
[02:39:18.060 --> 02:39:23.660]  him. I've seen his page. I see what he's doing. Even doing the natural farming. And if Bob,
[02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:29.180]  if you listen to this back, I would also say, do some free classes in the area, man.
[02:39:29.180 --> 02:39:33.260]  Figure out what those kind of catchwords are and what people are looking for. Do your natural
[02:39:33.260 --> 02:39:37.980]  farming classes. You'll be surprised. People will take interest. And then that's when maybe you can
[02:39:37.980 --> 02:39:43.740]  bridge the gap between you and reaching more people. Then now, obviously, they're coming
[02:39:43.740 --> 02:39:47.500]  to natural farming. They're into what we're doing. And they may like your products as well.
[02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:57.120]  Who knows? Man, a secret I sometimes use if I'm, if someone's coming to me and I'm wondering,
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:01.520]  like, you know, do they want the bougie things or not? I sometimes look at their shoes if I'm,
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:06.560]  if I'm being candid. Because if they got dirty shoes on, I'm not going to pitch them the high
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:11.200]  end stuff because they're just going to get mad at me to be honest. You know, I think that's almost
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:16.960]  like, yeah, it's almost, it almost works like 10 out of 10 times, man. You know, if you got to kind
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:23.280]  of maybe know that person or, you know, just kind of read your audience, read the room. You know,
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:27.200]  not everybody is there to get the expensive stuff. Some people are there just to get,
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:34.160]  you know, a $10 item or a $15 item. But my, you know, that's how my family eats. So I'm excited
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:40.000]  to sell a $10 item, a $15 item. And I don't see that even in the reptile game where people are
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:45.200]  appreciative as much of that, or where they're on their phone sitting down, and then they have a
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:52.160]  certain viewpoint of the expo. So the hustle has to be there 24 seven, but it definitely, you almost
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:57.840]  have to be on if you will, when you're networking, like you have to kind of have this like extra
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:03.600]  energy to you where, especially when you're behind a booth, because otherwise people are just going
[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:09.440]  to walk right, right by you. And there's other isobaric in the game. You know, I got, I got to
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:13.600]  interrupt you. I got to jump in. That's y'all's life, right? That, y'all life is that game.
[02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:19.520]  Right. This is working. We're, we're living this. It ain't like I'm just working 24 seven.
[02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:25.840]  Thank you, Bob. You came back. We're just talking about living, living that life, man. And, and,
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:31.040]  you know, being not necessarily, this is a grind. It is a grind, but it becomes your life. You know
[02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:35.840]  what I mean? When you start really doing somebody's business. It's not a grind forever where the, the
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:40.400]  other path in life seems like it is a grind forever, unless you're able to get like upper,
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:45.680]  upper management type stuff, you know, but then you don't have the freedom either. Cause usually
[02:41:45.680 --> 02:41:51.040]  when you're making upper management money, you got to work 70, 80 hours a week.
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:57.680]  Yeah, man. Gary V said something beautiful once on one of his talks. And he said, you know,
[02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:02.480]  on the micro level, you've got to do a lot of shit. You maybe don't want to, so that on the
[02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:07.600]  macro, you can do whatever the hell you want to. And I feel that's what I'm currently going through,
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:13.200]  you know, doing the smaller things, the, the, the grind and the grit just to, just to be able to set
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:19.040]  up that bigger picture that'll allow me, it's like setting up a good living soil bed. You know,
[02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:24.640]  it might not be as easy initially, but once it's set up, it's the baby sort of runs itself.
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:31.360]  Well, I don't know if I would, I would view it as the baby runs herself. Cause you've got to be
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:37.840]  nurturing that every single day for years and years and years. And then I think that's where
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:41.920]  things really pop off and think people think like just a few months is something
[02:42:42.640 --> 02:42:47.200]  when they first become an entrepreneur, where the reality is it's the few years. And that's
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:53.040]  why Marco was saying five-year plan, 10 year plan. Absolutely. I think you might even, you know,
[02:42:53.040 --> 02:42:57.600]  if I'm being, this is candid advice to you, Bob, I think you might need to also just really narrow
[02:42:57.680 --> 02:43:04.240]  in your vision, your focus, write that shit down. There's some magic to that. I hope that you,
[02:43:04.240 --> 02:43:08.000]  I know that some people feel a certain way about that stuff, but just seeing it written down,
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:13.040]  maybe even just writing it down and just put it on your mirror, you know, just no,
[02:43:13.040 --> 02:43:18.480]  even noble genetics, just so you see that shit every day. I am noble genetics. I wake up every
[02:43:18.480 --> 02:43:22.480]  day. I'm brushing my teeth, you know, doing your, whatever you're doing in the mirror and you're
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:29.360]  seeing that shit. And there's something to that man where on a daily, on a daily. So just be a
[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:34.320]  little more dialed in and how you're going to get to where you need to be. So, you know, if you,
[02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:38.720]  if you need a little more income, how am I going to get that? It sounds to me like you need to go
[02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:44.800]  to a larger audience because you have high end stuff that people aren't willing to pay for.
[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:49.200]  So you've got to go to where the high end people are. And I personally used to do that where I
[02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:53.040]  would smoke weed outside of high end restaurants and people would come over and ask me for that.
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:58.080]  So that might be like another little trick. You know, you, you have your marketing weed that you
[02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:03.200]  set aside after each growth and our peer group would do it that way. We would smoke people out
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:07.840]  constantly going to red rocks. I mean, just, it doesn't necessarily even have to be a cannabis
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:12.400]  expo when you're kind of in that gray world. It's more just like getting out there. And then you
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:16.240]  find those solid individuals that you want to work with. You weed out some of the other ones,
[02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:20.160]  because remember that all money isn't good money. There's always bad apples.
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:26.000]  I think that's the, the, one of the best quotes I've ever heard. And I don't remember who said
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:30.800]  it, but you don't chase it. Might've even been master Pete, but you don't chase after money.
[02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:36.480]  If there's so much nonsense to it, it's not worth it. You focus on these quality people that aren't
[02:44:36.480 --> 02:44:40.640]  hounding you for price or, or, you know, telling you to meet you at a certain time. And they show
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:46.000]  up an hour later, like, fuck those people, build that network. And then that's where it's going to
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:54.800]  come in for yourself. And I think I've been focusing on some collaborations. I'm working
[02:44:54.800 --> 02:44:59.600]  with someone that's offered me greenhouse space. So I'm going to use that to sort of show off the
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:06.480]  genetics a little bit, as well as give myself enough material to possibly wash. Cause I really
[02:45:06.480 --> 02:45:13.840]  enjoy making hashish, but the, the, the current, the yields of hashish versus a good BHO don't
[02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:20.960]  sort of speak for themselves. But with these collaborations, I'm able to hopefully expand
[02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:25.200]  that horizon a bit, you know, have a little bit more flowers so that I can do things like give
[02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:32.080]  some out for marketing. Cause at my scale, I find I often do things a little bit too small scale.
[02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:38.240]  And I'm needing to, to ramp that up a little bit to reach that wider audience, I think.
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:44.320]  I really, I really don't want to lose my level of craft while ramping that up. So I'm being real
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:49.840]  careful about doing that and being careful of who I collab with. Because yeah, like you said,
[02:45:49.840 --> 02:45:51.440]  not all money is good money.
[02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:56.320]  There you go. And my dad was saying that when I was a kid, so it was probably masterpiece daddy.
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:03.440]  But I just like listening to old cats like that, that maybe come from the streets a little bit.
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:08.480]  But I just like listening to old cats like that, that maybe come from the streets a little bit and
[02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:14.160]  then found mega success. You'd be surprised that masterpiece still making a lot of money.
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:19.280]  Cause he's an entrepreneur. He has so many businesses. You wouldn't even know he's got
[02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:22.480]  20, 10, 20 business, whatever it is. Lots of them.
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:28.400]  Yeah. And that is kind of the fun part is like, once you build one up,
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:31.440]  you know, if you choose to, you can sell it. You know, there's a lot of,
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:35.840]  a lot of opportunity there as well. But I think if you, if it's truly your passion,
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:39.920]  that should be something that's lifelong. You'd want to pass on to your children,
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:44.800]  the genetics that you're building up, Bob, I would think, you know, if you chose to go that route or
[02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:49.120]  people in your family and your life that are just, it's kind of a legacy that you can
[02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:52.480]  have where people are growing your genetics for decades after you're gone.
[02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:55.520]  Yeah. Let's hope so, man. Let's hope so.
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:47:00.640]  Yeah. Well, did you have any more questions for us? I wanted to kind of give you that opportunity
[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:06.720]  because again, we want to maybe have these as more of like a, and I'm glad that you were the first
[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:12.720]  one. So hats off to you for coming on. It was just, it just worked out pretty well, man. Even
[02:47:12.720 --> 02:47:17.600]  with the it issues, this is something special, not only for me, but I think hopefully in time
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:21.920]  for, for the audience and Marco, if you like going this way, buddy, then
[02:47:22.160 --> 02:47:28.800]  I can talk about natural farming, but like, man, I've had many businesses, a couple businesses now,
[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:32.960]  you know, I can talk business all day if that's what y'all want to do, but I'm, you know, yeah,
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:38.480]  I love it, man. I'd love to kind of tie what we do, our people in with business. And now that's
[02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:42.640]  just giving, letting me give a little bit more of myself also, which I think is dope.
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:47.680]  Yeah, man. I really appreciate you guys for the platform. I'm glad you're here.
[02:47:48.480 --> 02:47:52.960]  I have a lot of respect for the other people on the show, man. You talk about stresses with
[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:57.200]  driving around with illegal dank in the car. This shit's on another level, man.
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:04.960]  And that's why I appreciate you today. Yeah, man. I don't. Yeah, man. You're still a bit of
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:08.400]  a soldier on that cowboy. You know, you got that aspect to you.
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:14.240]  I had everything prepped nice and nice, like with my, with my, with my, with my,
[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:20.400]  I had everything prepped nice and not like with my rolling paper there, my NFT pictures there. I
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:25.200]  had some seeds to show you guys. And then the internet just bombs out and I'm walking around
[02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:31.760]  the garden. So, you know, we just roll with it. I, we, if you find a way where we can do that,
[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:35.040]  I'd love to have you back, man. You know, these are, these are ways to build up,
[02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:41.680]  you know, your brand there as well. So maybe find a way to do that. Or if you're ever in this,
[02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:46.560]  in a bigger city or something where you can make that happen. Yeah. I think that's definitely
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:52.640]  possible, man. You guys are really, really such amazing people for having me on and like,
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:56.960]  would really love to come back again. We'll just have to make sure I've got a better internet
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:05.840]  connection. Plans can always be made, you know, I'd love to see your seeds to my friend. We really
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:10.160]  missed him. We got to see your IG, but yeah, it's nothing like seeing the real thing.
[02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:14.560]  That's for sure. Thanks for showing that brother. I really appreciate it.
[02:49:15.680 --> 02:49:16.320]  Oh, you're welcome.
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:19.520]  Well, did you have any other questions?
[02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:27.440]  I don't think so. I think we covered everything fairly well, man. I appreciate all your guys'
[02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:33.600]  input. I'm definitely going to be looking into making the website a bit. I'm going to be doing
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:39.040]  more educational videos on the YouTube channel as well. I'm just sharing some natural farming
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:44.720]  stuff and my way of doing it. Cause it's not always like the most conventional, but it works.
[02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:51.760]  Yeah, man. And thank you for sharing also about the NFTs. I wrote down Saldana.
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:55.760]  Saldana. Saldana. S-O-L-A-N-A.
[02:49:57.920 --> 02:50:02.080]  Yeah. And so I'm definitely going to look at them and start doing a little research on that end too,
[02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:07.680]  man. Because I like, you know, when I was 20 something, you know, I did a lot of things that
[02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:12.400]  were going on back then. Think about it, freaking invest in Amazon or something back then, you know,
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:16.960]  when I was just grinding. So now's the time when you hear a young and doing these things like you
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:24.000]  are, man, I say that with much respect and admiration for your youth. But when I hear
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:27.680]  the young folks telling me those things, that's telling me that's the direction it's going. You
[02:50:27.680 --> 02:50:31.600]  know what I mean? So thank you for driving that knowledge on.
[02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:36.560]  Thanks very much, man. I wasn't around for it, but they're saying that this is going to be similar
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:44.000]  to the dot-com boom back in the nineties, you know? So it's definitely a space to watch,
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:48.160]  but it's a space to be careful in at the moment. Cause at the moment it's the wild, wild west, man.
[02:50:50.720 --> 02:50:54.000]  So was the dark calm back in the day too.
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:54.640]  That's true.
[02:50:55.360 --> 02:50:59.760]  A lot of people lost a lot of money with that as well. But then the Jeff Bezos of the world
[02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:01.920]  were born in the same time, you know?
[02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:10.000]  I love that picture. I don't like Jeff Bezos as a person, but I do love his picture at the
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:13.520]  beginning where he spray, have you seen that photo Marco, where he spray painted
[02:51:13.520 --> 02:51:20.880]  Amazon with like the stencil thing? Maybe Ken can find that. It's probably all over the internet.
[02:51:20.880 --> 02:51:22.320]  We all start somewhere, you know?
[02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:26.880]  Kind of already like so many businesses out of the garage. So hats off to Bob.
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:32.720]  Just proud to be able to highlight a small business owner. You know, obviously in another
[02:51:32.720 --> 02:51:38.640]  country, this is amazing to be able to talk to you live. Yeah, man. Pretty sweet.
[02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:43.680]  Thank you guys for all the shows you've done so far, man. I've been a watcher
[02:51:43.680 --> 02:51:49.440]  since the show started pretty much. When COVID hit future cannabis project was a savior.
[02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:55.360]  Just started binge watching that shit. A lot of information has been learned. And like you say,
[02:51:55.360 --> 02:51:59.600]  putting in the hours, it's like lifting weights. You know, I sit and I watch anything I can find
[02:51:59.600 --> 02:52:04.720]  on breeding and all the natural farming stuff. You pick up tidbits along the way that really
[02:52:04.720 --> 02:52:13.790]  benefit the long game. Yeah. Shout out Silly Lily always dropping the gems on us. Appreciate you.
[02:52:13.790 --> 02:52:19.950]  Now, congrats on 30 years married. I saw your post over there. That's respectable. Love it.
[02:52:19.950 --> 02:52:26.990]  We just had our anniversary last week. 11 on the marriage, 18 together. What can I say?
[02:52:28.110 --> 02:52:29.310]  Congratulations, brother.
[02:52:29.310 --> 02:52:31.550]  Seven to make sure everything was going to be right.
[02:52:32.830 --> 02:52:36.830]  I was going to razz you for that. Damn, you made her wait a long time.
[02:52:37.630 --> 02:52:40.030]  I had it going on, man. It was worth the wait.
[02:52:42.030 --> 02:52:46.990]  I'm sure she was worth the wait too, brother. And she's probably there. She's going to smack
[02:52:47.070 --> 02:52:51.310]  you in the back of the head. Exactly. She knows what she knows.
[02:52:52.990 --> 02:52:56.910]  Well, that's the thing about your wife, man. She's cool. She's one of those that can take
[02:52:56.910 --> 02:53:00.750]  a joke or realize that you're kidding around. Exactly.
[02:53:00.750 --> 02:53:06.510]  And see why he married her. Exactly. Good woman. Just like you, man. I like that our wives get
[02:53:06.510 --> 02:53:12.910]  along. That's dope. A lot of times women can't even have a conversation. I didn't like her.
[02:53:13.150 --> 02:53:17.230]  You know what I mean? So that's pretty cool. Thank you. Appreciate you.
[02:53:19.310 --> 02:53:24.030]  Okay. So you guys want to shut her down or you want to keep going?
[02:53:26.030 --> 02:53:31.310]  Yeah, we can shut her down. This has been a great episode. And again, we appreciate all
[02:53:31.310 --> 02:53:36.270]  of your feedback. So we'll think about more of these kinds of shows where we're obviously going
[02:53:36.830 --> 02:53:43.390]  have a highlight on cannabis. But if the community itself isn't eating together and we don't have
[02:53:43.390 --> 02:53:47.470]  people that are finding their own businesses and stuff, then I don't feel like we're finding
[02:53:47.470 --> 02:53:51.630]  success. I want this community to be where it's like, damn, man, this little future cannabis
[02:53:51.630 --> 02:53:56.110]  project thing. There's a lot of people popping off with these little businesses seem to be all
[02:53:56.110 --> 02:54:00.830]  doing well within that instead of when, you know, in the cannabis space a few years ago,
[02:54:00.830 --> 02:54:05.390]  I felt like when people started to pop off, it was just on them now. It's like, fuck everybody
[02:54:05.390 --> 02:54:10.350]  else. I got my own thing. I would love to see the opposite of that. I feel like that is long-term
[02:54:10.350 --> 02:54:14.670]  success. And hopefully we will continue to head in that direction as a community.
[02:54:15.550 --> 02:54:16.670]  Yeah. Well said, man.
[02:54:18.430 --> 02:54:22.430]  If we're going to cut the video off, let me see if I can get the video going.
[02:54:23.390 --> 02:54:25.950]  You got to get that. We got to get one for, there you go.
[02:54:25.950 --> 02:54:30.270]  Oh, hold on. Let me get that up in the top corner so I can upsize it here. There we go.
[02:54:31.150 --> 02:54:34.670]  This is just the front facing camera. I'm not sure how to turn around.
[02:54:34.670 --> 02:54:35.390]  They look happy.
[02:54:35.390 --> 02:54:42.110]  These are the ladies I've got in the greenhouse at the moment. This is the Mac 69 crossed with
[02:54:42.110 --> 02:54:50.270]  a sure breath from that Canadian breeder, Irish Dabs. They're doing right. These got blown over
[02:54:50.270 --> 02:54:56.990]  in the wind. The whole tunnel was over the fence, which was a fun time. And then I've got my little
[02:54:56.990 --> 02:54:59.710]  that's just been chilling here while we do the show.
[02:55:00.590 --> 02:55:03.470]  Nice. They look good, man.
[02:55:04.750 --> 02:55:06.030]  Oh yeah. Good job, man.
[02:55:07.470 --> 02:55:10.670]  Small time, doing it right. Healthy plants.
[02:55:11.310 --> 02:55:11.790]  Quality.
[02:55:12.910 --> 02:55:13.790]  Natural farming.
[02:55:15.150 --> 02:55:16.190]  Yes, sir. 100%.
[02:55:16.190 --> 02:55:17.070]  At it's best.
[02:55:19.470 --> 02:55:21.950]  All right, bro. He's okay. He's back. He's still in.
[02:55:22.750 --> 02:55:28.110]  All right, guys. I'm going to end her here. So everybody, much love and we will see you tomorrow
[02:55:28.670 --> 02:55:31.710]  on the Living Soils Conversations with Brian Layton.
[02:55:32.910 --> 02:55:33.230]  Yes, we will.
