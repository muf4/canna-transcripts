[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  thing off. Back on because so we are live now. We've been making fun of Layton's bandana.
[00:06.240 --> 00:13.680]  I asked him if he just came off the Hulk Hogan WWF tag team. And then where'd you ask him if
[00:13.680 --> 00:17.280]  he just came from? I was gonna be in the laundry after this.
[00:21.280 --> 00:26.320]  All right. It's another Thursday morning, everyone. Welcome. Thanks for joining us.
[00:26.320 --> 00:32.320]  Mr. Brian in Denver, take it away. Yeah, absolutely. Good morning,
[00:32.320 --> 00:38.640]  Living Soil Nerds. It's another epic show. We are honored actually to have this guest on board.
[00:38.640 --> 00:42.640]  There's a lot of people out there that reached out to me personally. They're super excited to hear
[00:42.640 --> 00:48.880]  from Ian. You know, for a lot of us out there, this guy really needs no introduction. I would
[00:48.880 --> 00:53.120]  even put you up there as a legend, sir, for what you've been able to put out there into the
[00:53.680 --> 00:58.320]  quality products that you've done. And you've been doing it for an extremely long time. I know
[00:58.320 --> 01:03.440]  I personally started a little on my YouTube journey from the Mendo dope, the tales of the
[01:03.440 --> 01:07.920]  doper learning all about that and learning more from brown guy 420, which we actually had on the
[01:07.920 --> 01:12.400]  show just a couple weeks ago. And that's why you know, Ian, I'm excited to have you on the show as
[01:12.400 --> 01:17.280]  well as because you're one of those OGs for me, man. You're somebody that I was learning a lot
[01:17.280 --> 01:23.360]  from. You even had a picture, I think it was in 2016, that everybody stole from you on mass
[01:23.360 --> 01:30.400]  routes and was pretending to put up there. I sent it to Peter. It was cool to see, man. I mean,
[01:30.400 --> 01:36.320]  I know that kind of I was wondering the context of that image. I was like, OK, yeah, I'll get
[01:36.320 --> 01:41.920]  that up. So, you know, with that with that photo, at least on mass routes and some of these other
[01:41.920 --> 01:47.840]  cannabis social media apps where a lot of people couldn't really call out certain people's work,
[01:47.840 --> 01:52.720]  you know, that thing went viral on there. And that's what made me start to look at you as like,
[01:52.720 --> 01:57.360]  wow, this guy is on a whole nother level. And you're definitely doing it before anybody out
[01:57.360 --> 02:02.640]  there was really educating. So, again, I just want to kind of give a background to the viewers that
[02:02.640 --> 02:08.000]  don't know who you are. But I would say a lot of the OGs that are even in this, especially five
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.960]  years or less, kind of thing that I'm starting to really understand this. All of us appreciate
[02:12.960 --> 02:18.560]  your work, sir. So thank you for that. And just kind of let you discuss who you are. I know a lot
[02:18.560 --> 02:23.760]  of people want to discuss genetics. We're going to talk about botanicals and stuff like that.
[02:23.760 --> 02:30.160]  The so nuts thing is obviously huge. But yeah, go back with more of just like who you are, man.
[02:30.160 --> 02:36.240]  For a lot of people that don't know, this is Ian's first podcast. So we're excited to pick his brain
[02:36.240 --> 02:40.800]  for our viewers. This is an extremely unique opportunity for you guys to get your questions in
[02:40.800 --> 02:47.200]  and pick a brain that all of us here, you know, look at you as a mentor, man, as an OG, if you
[02:47.200 --> 02:53.920]  will. So thank you. Thank you. Yeah, man, I appreciate being here. You know, it's really
[02:53.920 --> 02:58.640]  great to finally be out and talk. Again, thanks for having me. A little background, you know,
[02:59.680 --> 03:04.880]  when I started playing around, I was doing no-till gardening, what I call it, before it was
[03:04.880 --> 03:08.720]  had a name, no-till gardening, you know, and I just wanted to grow really good weed at the time.
[03:08.720 --> 03:13.760]  You know, I was pretty young. I was always in tune with I grew up gardening with my mom,
[03:13.760 --> 03:21.360]  you know, since I was a baby and just always wanted to bring that to the medicine I grew,
[03:21.360 --> 03:26.800]  you know. And at the time, you look outside, cannabis has always been like a special plant,
[03:26.800 --> 03:31.360]  you know, so you got the special stores, you know, we're going back to the late 90s, early 2000s,
[03:31.360 --> 03:35.840]  you know, so it's like, okay, if I want to go grow really good cannabis, we got to go and,
[03:35.840 --> 03:39.600]  you know, take that route, go to the hydro store, you know, and no disrespect to all the people
[03:39.600 --> 03:44.240]  doing it right, selling great products, you know, but at the time, you walk in and they push all
[03:44.240 --> 03:49.440]  this, this, that and the other thing, you know, and it honestly, it really screwed me up, you know,
[03:49.440 --> 03:55.360]  taking me away from my roots and what I felt was the right way to grow it. So scoured on the
[03:55.360 --> 04:00.160]  internet, you know, started finding the forums, Overgrow was still active at that time, you know,
[04:00.160 --> 04:07.760]  huge, and you find this community, this just massive, massive community of growers from all
[04:07.760 --> 04:13.920]  over the world, just trying to find out as much as they can and figure out the best way to grow
[04:13.920 --> 04:19.920]  the best medicine. And I plugged into that, like, to an obsessive level, you know, really,
[04:21.040 --> 04:28.320]  and dedicated myself to researching for, I mean, nightly till early morning for a year,
[04:28.320 --> 04:33.680]  reading anything and everything I could. And at that time, my biggest influence was Bog,
[04:33.680 --> 04:42.000]  rest in peace, you know, drew all his genetics, started out with his, his soil mixes, you know,
[04:43.120 --> 04:49.840]  and it grew from there, I had, I had a strong desire to, to figure out what the best way was,
[04:49.840 --> 04:53.360]  you know, and feel free to jump in, I'll just keep rambling, feel free to jump in with questions at
[04:53.360 --> 05:00.320]  any time. And, you know, through the forums connected with people looking at, you know,
[05:00.320 --> 05:07.920]  doing recycled living soil, you know, hooked up with Jim Coot. And he became a big influence in
[05:07.920 --> 05:12.240]  my life, you know, became a really close friend for a long time, gifted me a lot of genetics,
[05:12.240 --> 05:17.360]  and we'll get into that later, I'm sure. And, I mean, assuming if we want to talk about,
[05:17.360 --> 05:19.520]  I wore my shirt today, the No-Till Gardening shirt, check it out.
[05:20.240 --> 05:26.160]  Yeah, man, you've been doing this for such a long time that for the viewers that don't know about
[05:26.160 --> 05:31.120]  you, this is extremely important. And I hope they take root of this is how things progress. You
[05:31.120 --> 05:36.560]  know, I have learned from you, sir, on a whole different level, taking that and then continue
[05:36.560 --> 05:40.960]  to research. And then obviously, every Thursday, Leighton, myself, Peter and Daguerre here are
[05:40.960 --> 05:46.080]  trying to put out free education so that we can minimize really that learning curve of things.
[05:46.160 --> 05:49.760]  But you're the one that kind of helped start that. And then that's what I mean,
[05:49.760 --> 05:53.360]  that that second wave is now coming. And that's, you know, yeah, it's really neat.
[05:54.480 --> 05:58.800]  Yeah, it's really neat to see. And that's all I really did was make a shit ton of mistakes along
[05:58.800 --> 06:06.560]  the way, you know, and I did it all. And that really helped to hone in on what worked and what
[06:06.560 --> 06:13.040]  didn't work. You know, it was really interesting progression to take it from wanting to add every
[06:13.040 --> 06:18.080]  single ingredient possible, you know, the super soil approach with 10, 15, 20 amendments,
[06:19.600 --> 06:25.440]  dumping, dumping your soil out after each cycle. But then you get it's such a clusterfuck, you
[06:25.440 --> 06:29.440]  don't, you don't realize what's working or what's not, you have a bad cycle. It's like, well, what
[06:29.440 --> 06:34.720]  did it I don't know, I use too many different things, you know, or what worked really well,
[06:34.720 --> 06:38.800]  everything, you know, went together. Well, it's like, well, what made that I don't know,
[06:38.800 --> 06:45.280]  I use too many different things. So from there, I really wanted to, to simplify and have a base,
[06:47.360 --> 06:52.560]  have a have a base for that, and do one input at a time and really see what's working and what's not.
[06:53.680 --> 06:59.680]  And it's, it's really about, you know, I had I was introduced to Masanobu Fukuoka,
[06:59.680 --> 07:03.680]  the one straw revolution, you know, and his philosophy of working with nature,
[07:04.320 --> 07:10.800]  and, and the symbiosis that happens, growing a lot of plants together, not disturbing the soil,
[07:10.800 --> 07:16.000]  that concept really sat well with me, and I wanted to start playing around with that.
[07:16.880 --> 07:21.200]  And so you see those connections that happen in the soil between the soil and the plant
[07:21.200 --> 07:28.400]  inputs you're using. And it started to make a lot of sense to just back away from, from dumping so
[07:28.400 --> 07:35.120]  much stuff in there and, and really see what's working, what's not. And what I started to see
[07:35.120 --> 07:39.840]  was that it wasn't about the different amendments you're using. It's about the interaction between
[07:39.840 --> 07:45.760]  the organic matter in the soil, the minerals, the plant, and then proper environment watering,
[07:45.760 --> 07:52.640]  you can't do shit with unless that's in place, you know. So the more the more that made sense,
[07:52.960 --> 07:58.800]  the more I wanted to go deeper in that, you know, and that's started messing around with
[07:58.800 --> 08:06.720]  the cover crops, companion, companion plants came much later. But yeah, man, it was, it's been quite
[08:06.720 --> 08:12.960]  a journey, the last 15, and really the last 10 to 12 years honing in on what I consider, you know,
[08:12.960 --> 08:18.400]  the Mountain Organics no-till gardening approach, all the products I sell are stuff I use, you know,
[08:18.400 --> 08:22.960]  on a daily basis. That's, that's was a big, big thing for me and my business model was
[08:22.960 --> 08:31.520]  to offer what I use what I can get behind, you know. And yeah, you know, experimenting so much
[08:31.520 --> 08:39.760]  with so many different pot sizes. All that with, with, with no-till wrapping that in there.
[08:40.000 --> 08:47.120]  And yeah, you guys got any questions? Eric had a lot to turn aside.
[08:47.120 --> 08:47.680]  Yeah, no problem.
[08:49.280 --> 08:53.120]  Sometimes, especially during the pregame, a little bit before the show.
[08:55.120 --> 08:57.760]  Do you ever play with teas? You playing with?
[08:57.760 --> 09:02.240]  I did a lot. I did a lot, you know, and that was another thing that came together for me
[09:02.240 --> 09:08.560]  personally, when we build these epic soils that are like super loaded, you know, I stopped seeing
[09:08.800 --> 09:14.640]  I stopped seeing results with teas and it didn't make a lot of sense to me to,
[09:15.840 --> 09:20.000]  we're talking about soil microbes, not water microbes per se, you know, I know I'm gonna get a
[09:20.000 --> 09:26.720]  lot of shit for that after this. But what I, the more, the better based soil you build,
[09:26.720 --> 09:31.680]  the more you see that you don't need to add much and you let it work together. It's an ecosystem.
[09:32.240 --> 09:36.400]  Okay. And the relationship between the soil and the plants you grow in it,
[09:36.400 --> 09:42.960]  create the proper atmosphere in and of itself. So you want the soil life to grow with your soil.
[09:44.400 --> 09:49.920]  So I'd rather top dress a handful of compost on top of the soil rather than go through the
[09:49.920 --> 09:55.200]  bubbling thing, you know, where I do see a great benefit for teas is in field use,
[09:55.840 --> 10:01.360]  where the native soils don't have a lot of life or organic matter. That can go a long way when
[10:01.360 --> 10:04.960]  you're building soil and it's going to take a little longer, you're not going to dump,
[10:04.960 --> 10:09.120]  you know, tons of compost. If you're talking about acreage, you know, you're going to be doing a
[10:09.120 --> 10:14.000]  little bit, you're going to mulch, you're going to cover crop, and then you can spray your teas to
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.440]  enhance and quicken that process that's happening there by adding that life. And that's where I see
[10:19.440 --> 10:26.080]  great benefit from teas, you know, not necessarily in these top-notch Lamborghini style soils,
[10:26.880 --> 10:34.000]  we're building or buying that are, you know, pretty, you know, pumped up to begin with,
[10:34.240 --> 10:39.520]  I just don't see that need with it. Yeah, it's basically what you're doing is an inoculation
[10:39.520 --> 10:44.880]  approach. So basically, you've got all the minerals in play, now you just got to add that,
[10:44.880 --> 10:51.600]  you know, primary organisms, let it grow. Yeah, exactly. You know, and it's a lot of it, it's,
[10:51.600 --> 10:55.360]  it's what is the gardener like, you know, if you enjoy that, that's great, whether you just want
[10:55.360 --> 11:00.320]  to top dress, the life is there in the vermicompost, your compost, you're using the mulch,
[11:00.320 --> 11:04.720]  all that. So whatever way you want to get it in there, you know, given a little boost here and
[11:04.720 --> 11:09.280]  there, it's great. I haven't personally made a compost tea in, you know, maybe seven years,
[11:09.280 --> 11:15.440]  something like that, you know, and where I was at my garden and long term no till where the soil is
[11:15.440 --> 11:19.840]  continually improving over time, you're doing cover crops and mulch, there just wasn't any
[11:19.840 --> 11:25.760]  difference. And I wanted to create an approach that was as simple as possible, so that it wasn't
[11:25.840 --> 11:32.880]  intimidating for anyone that was new, new to it, or, you know, maybe you don't have a spot in your
[11:32.880 --> 11:40.400]  home to, to make teas. So that's, that's what the big part of it was, let's try to make this as
[11:40.400 --> 11:48.800]  simple as possible, you know, and then work it from that angle. I love the approach. Yeah, thank
[11:48.800 --> 11:57.840]  you. All you're doing is potentially bio-stimulating. So by adding tea to it, you're just feeding the
[11:57.840 --> 12:02.160]  microbes, but do you really need to do it? And that's the point, you don't, you know, it's,
[12:02.160 --> 12:06.080]  it's really not going to see much benefit once that soil system is up and running.
[12:06.080 --> 12:12.320]  So I love it. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the other thing with soil microbes. I've been
[12:12.320 --> 12:15.520]  studying that a bit more the last few years. The business has gotten a little
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.920]  heavy the last couple of years also. So not as much as I'd like in the last year, but soil
[12:21.920 --> 12:28.000]  microbiology is fascinating. And a lot of, a lot of the microbes that are talked about are sold
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.560]  in blends. These things, we got to remember, they're ubiquitous to soils throughout the world.
[12:32.560 --> 12:38.480]  If you're using any compost, use even the peat, even your basic peat has mycorrhizae in it. So all of
[12:38.480 --> 12:44.000]  that grows and meshes together. That's not to say there isn't the research and clear benefit to
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.720]  adding inoculants. There clearly is. You know, it's kind of like throwing mud at the wall. The
[12:48.720 --> 12:52.560]  more you throw, the more that can stick, you know, but as far as what's necessary, what's going to
[12:52.560 --> 12:57.600]  get the job done, you know, it's nice to know that you can grow some amazing food and medicine
[12:58.880 --> 13:04.720]  without having to fuss much, you know. When you were figuring all this out, man,
[13:04.720 --> 13:09.760]  you know, you had mentioned bog seeds, you know, rest in peace, bog, a bushy old grower,
[13:10.720 --> 13:14.080]  especially from the overgrown forums and stuff, you know, a guy who's always given out
[13:15.600 --> 13:20.640]  information. For me, I was, you know, truth be told, I felt like I was always growing mids,
[13:20.640 --> 13:26.480]  always barely making it, barely having people interested in my cannabis until I started
[13:26.480 --> 13:30.800]  from learning from you, sir, as well from growing the blue moon rocks, which came from
[13:31.360 --> 13:36.720]  a bushy old guy. And I was, I was able to find a real phenol that we lovingly joked a long time
[13:36.720 --> 13:41.680]  ago, always paid the mortgage for us. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. It was tried and true. I know that
[13:41.680 --> 13:46.400]  he didn't come out with a bunch of new genetics all the time. He's really kind of rocked his
[13:46.400 --> 13:51.040]  original beer. Was that something that you started off from the gate that you knew that
[13:51.040 --> 13:56.240]  bog was tried and true type genetics, or did you have to kind of go through the circus of figuring
[13:56.240 --> 14:03.280]  out especially at more of the commercial level, who is tried and true? Yeah. You know, I,
[14:03.680 --> 14:07.760]  I attached real well to his link real well with his approach and wanted to grow his seeds, you
[14:07.760 --> 14:12.960]  know, his whole, his whole philosophy was like, right on, man, this is cool. So I ended up growing
[14:12.960 --> 14:18.320]  just about everything he put out there. And loved all of it. The sour bubble was a cut. I grew a lot
[14:18.320 --> 14:25.600]  and went to the local shops and stuff. So yeah, but I mean, really, like since then, and, and,
[14:25.600 --> 14:29.760]  you know, with with him helping with his, you know, I read his book, that kind of thing. And then
[14:29.840 --> 14:36.720]  the living soil forums with Jim, Kooten, and all that gang back in the day, you know, everyone was
[14:36.720 --> 14:41.120]  sharing a lot of knowledge. And when I started piecing things together, and what worked for me,
[14:41.120 --> 14:46.560]  I just wanted to keep doing that, you know, posting pictures, sharing what figuring stuff
[14:46.560 --> 14:49.840]  out, you know, I'm trying this and that, and this seemed to work better, you know,
[14:49.840 --> 14:57.440]  and it just grew from there. And seeing the people's interest. And the direction I was going
[14:58.400 --> 15:03.360]  was like, okay, this is really cool, you know, people reaching out, you know, thanking me,
[15:03.360 --> 15:07.040]  you know, so I just wanted to return the favor, essentially what it comes down to,
[15:07.760 --> 15:12.320]  you know, and I hold that, you know, to heart to this day, you know, I made I made this,
[15:13.040 --> 15:20.000]  this hobby, this passion, my life's work, you know. So it is a business and I want to, you know,
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.440]  need to pay the bills. We all know that. But just to hold that true and be true to that.
[15:26.080 --> 15:29.600]  Always, always a focus on education moving forward. You know, that's huge.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.840]  Yeah, definitely a pioneer in that kind of educating on why your plants were looking
[15:35.840 --> 15:38.080]  so healthy before a lot of people would share that.
[15:38.640 --> 15:42.880]  So what, if you don't mind me asking, you said things really clicked when when you started
[15:42.880 --> 15:47.520]  reading my stuff. Can you hone in on anything specific that really changed things for you
[15:47.520 --> 15:48.080]  that I brought?
[15:49.040 --> 15:53.760]  More than I was coming from genetics. A lot of people were talking about your Acapulco gold.
[15:54.320 --> 15:54.820]  Yeah.
[15:55.360 --> 15:58.880]  You know, those kind of things. But at the same time, it seemed like you really understood
[15:58.880 --> 16:02.880]  foiler feeding when, you know, on the forums, there was still a lot of people that were
[16:02.880 --> 16:07.760]  discussing whether that was a good or bad thing. I'd love to talk to you today, sir, about me.
[16:07.760 --> 16:11.360]  There's so many people out there that don't want to spray that anymore as a foiler.
[16:11.920 --> 16:16.880]  So it's just, you know, I'm excited to pick your brain as much as everybody else, because
[16:17.520 --> 16:21.760]  I feel like you were able to show what's going on, not necessarily even through words and written
[16:21.760 --> 16:26.480]  text, but just through pictures. And for me, that's really what, you know, if you're showing
[16:26.480 --> 16:30.080]  off your growth, you're showing off. That was another thing that I was talking to Brown guy
[16:30.080 --> 16:33.920]  about. He was showing off his mistakes, the corners in his room that were just complete
[16:33.920 --> 16:34.960]  dog shit kind of thing.
[16:35.600 --> 16:36.080]  Yeah.
[16:36.080 --> 16:40.400]  You know, when you were panning your room and stuff, man, you're from whenever I discovered
[16:40.400 --> 16:42.560]  you, your stuff has been dialed in ever since.
[16:43.360 --> 16:47.040]  Yeah, yeah. I appreciate that. You know, and for a long time, I never fully foiler sprayed,
[16:47.040 --> 16:52.320]  you know, just, you know, beginners luck or whatever. It just never seemed necessary.
[16:52.320 --> 16:59.200]  And I also didn't understand it early on. But it was with messing around with neem oil
[16:59.200 --> 17:04.800]  initially, really. I had a room eight years ago, longer, that was completely demolished
[17:04.800 --> 17:09.760]  with powdery mildew. 30 day harvest is trash the whole thing, you know, and that was a
[17:09.760 --> 17:16.400]  big eye opener, you know. So I looked deeper into that. And we were experimenting with a
[17:16.400 --> 17:20.800]  lot of stuff at that time, ending up with this with the SSTs, sprouted seed purees,
[17:20.800 --> 17:26.640]  but with the neem oil and when, you know, leaves are covered with mouth, the stomata,
[17:26.640 --> 17:32.000]  they breathe out of it, they feed out of it. You know, cleaning the leaves, the leaves
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.120]  are living, there's beneficial bacterias living in and on the leaves throughout the entire
[17:37.120 --> 17:44.880]  plant. And they do consume through the plant and they have, you know, like a gate, you
[17:44.880 --> 17:48.960]  know, mouth parts on the stomata that will either disallow or allow things in it, you
[17:48.960 --> 17:53.680]  know, so they recognize what's available to them and uptake them. Also researching in
[17:53.680 --> 18:00.960]  fruit crops, how important it is for macronutrients, micronutrients, excuse me, and fruit crops
[18:00.960 --> 18:07.200]  and how important that is for the health, you know. And also, you know, that really
[18:07.200 --> 18:13.600]  ties in with my approach to getting your soil up to par to begin with, so you don't need
[18:13.600 --> 18:19.760]  many inputs, so then you're not doing top dresses, you're not doing heavy, like liquid
[18:19.760 --> 18:25.600]  feeds in your soil. So, let's just do a light supplement on through the leaves, you know,
[18:25.600 --> 18:31.360]  and that covers IPM and that's where all my products came in is because no matter how
[18:31.360 --> 18:35.360]  perfect the world it is, you know, you're going to be susceptible to pest attack at
[18:35.360 --> 18:41.600]  some point in your, in your grows. So, to have a regular, you know, let's say weekly
[18:41.600 --> 18:47.920]  maintenance feed that covers all your bases from growth stimulation to, to pest management
[18:47.920 --> 18:53.840]  and then a light supplemental feed kind of fills in the blanks that the soil might not
[18:53.840 --> 19:00.000]  be picking up at, you know. It pairs really, really well with growing in a humus and mineral
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.400]  rich soil, you know. And then taking it back to the neem thing, I know you brought that
[19:04.400 --> 19:09.680]  up. From what I understand, the whole neem scare thing started with some research put
[19:09.680 --> 19:15.760]  out on synthetic asadirach products, not cold pressed organic neem oil. So, it's a
[19:15.760 --> 19:23.040]  really concentrated form. So, I don't think it's necessarily fair to, to take that research
[19:23.040 --> 19:29.200]  on something that's concentrated and putting it to a cold pressed seed oil. These compounds
[19:29.200 --> 19:34.720]  degrade pretty quickly. There's not left residue on the leaves. But, you know, it comes down
[19:34.720 --> 19:38.560]  to a personal, you know, preference, what you feel comfortable with. It's an option.
[19:38.560 --> 19:44.800]  It's great. I love neem in every aspect from body care to medicine and to plant care in the
[19:44.800 --> 19:51.360]  soil, neem cake, you know, to, to foliar sprays. One thing that's not often talked about with
[19:51.360 --> 19:58.000]  neem is how nutrient rich it is. And it's the sulfuric compounds that aid in pest prevention,
[19:58.000 --> 20:09.520]  but also to aid in the enhancement of flavor and, you know, color and flavor, terpene profiles of
[20:09.520 --> 20:17.040]  foods and herbs. It's, it's a sulfur pathway that can enhance that. And neem has a lot of sulfur.
[20:17.040 --> 20:23.600]  So, if you use that, you're enhancing the flavors, the cannabinoids, terpene content of,
[20:23.600 --> 20:26.080]  of your, whatever you're growing, whether it's oregano or cannabis,
[20:26.640 --> 20:31.360]  you know, it's a, it's a great thing. I think everyone should, you know, try it if they haven't,
[20:31.360 --> 20:33.920]  you know. And—
[20:33.920 --> 20:38.400]  The quality is what matters there, correct Ian? I mean, there's so many different,
[20:38.960 --> 20:40.160]  you know, products out there.
[20:40.160 --> 20:45.920]  Yes, exactly. And you, you really just want a cold press organic neem oil. You know, don't go for
[20:45.920 --> 20:52.960]  the bottles that have all sorts of different, you know, process to get there. There's a percent,
[20:52.960 --> 21:00.080]  70% neem oil kind of thing. And, or, or as that are acting percent where you may notice that
[21:00.080 --> 21:09.920]  they're adding extra to it. The, the test results show that, you know, the organic neem farms put
[21:09.920 --> 21:15.760]  out a lot more compounds, active compounds in, in, in both the neem cake, the neem oil,
[21:16.720 --> 21:23.440]  then, then, then otherwise. So definitely just shoot for, you know, we carry the Ahimsa brand
[21:23.440 --> 21:28.080]  neem. Usha is a great person. You know, she's person involved with importing everything from
[21:28.080 --> 21:33.680]  organic farms in India. You know, real happy to support her. And my latest product,
[21:34.560 --> 21:39.440]  Leaf Tonic Plus Neem. So that's the other thing with neem is that you have to emulsify it, you
[21:39.440 --> 21:44.560]  know, and the first time I used neem oil, I didn't, you know, I didn't really register that it's
[21:44.640 --> 21:49.360]  floating on the top. You just keep shaking it and spray it. So I think that's still probably an issue
[21:51.120 --> 21:55.680]  that not properly emulsifying it or not knowing that you need to, you need to make it water
[21:55.680 --> 22:01.120]  soluble, you know, just like salad dressing, the oil is going to sit on the water. So there's been
[22:01.120 --> 22:06.480]  a number of options. Some work better. Some don't work so well to emulsify the neem oil, making it
[22:06.480 --> 22:13.600]  water soluble. The one we always use, always use back in the day was Protect, you know, Agsil 16H.
[22:14.720 --> 22:20.800]  But I didn't like using that because it is a synthetically produced salt, you know, they mix
[22:20.800 --> 22:25.280]  sand with what is I think potassium hydroxide. That's how you get the potassium silicate.
[22:26.800 --> 22:33.840]  Through that way, Dr. Bronner soap, you know, that kind of thing. But we discovered the soap nuts,
[22:33.840 --> 22:39.600]  and they are extremely high in saponins, you know, so we would soak, you know, a couple of the of
[22:39.600 --> 22:44.000]  the seeds, and it's actually the husk, it's not the actual seed, it's the seed husk, that's loaded
[22:44.000 --> 22:49.360]  with saponins, and you make a little concentrate, mix it with your neem oil, and it emulsifies
[22:49.360 --> 22:56.080]  beautifully. When I started making the tonics that I offer, the I have some right here,
[22:56.640 --> 23:02.240]  I'm probably not going to focus real well, but the leaf tonic plus neem, I played around with a lot
[23:02.240 --> 23:09.440]  of different ratios and was able to put all of my botanical extracts I've made, along with just
[23:09.440 --> 23:15.600]  enough soap nut extract and neem oil in one bottle. So you just give it a shake, you don't
[23:15.600 --> 23:20.640]  have to use anything else to emulsify it separately, pour it in the water, and you can see as you pour
[23:20.640 --> 23:25.680]  it in, it turns milky, and it's emulsifying immediately. And what's really cool about it,
[23:25.680 --> 23:30.000]  the medium, the glycerin medium we use for extraction, it actually pulls out active
[23:30.000 --> 23:37.360]  compounds from the neem oil itself, like kind of like pre pre charging it, so to speak, it's,
[23:37.920 --> 23:44.080]  it's incorporated into the water soluble aspect of the product itself. So what I feel is that
[23:44.080 --> 23:51.520]  we're able to use a fraction of the amount of neem oil and have equal or better results in the end,
[23:51.520 --> 23:57.040]  you know, and I'm all about minimum, you know, minimalistic inputs and being able to maximize
[23:57.040 --> 24:01.440]  people's dollar on the products they are purchasing for their growth. So I'm really,
[24:01.440 --> 24:07.840]  really proud of this latest line of tonics I created and put out in November, and especially
[24:07.840 --> 24:14.160]  the ones with the neem oil. And also adding essential oils to it, which really beef up the
[24:14.160 --> 24:19.840]  pest fighting capabilities. And I've documented knocking out pretty much every pest with it,
[24:19.840 --> 24:25.360]  you know, from your mites to your thrips to fungus gnats, you know, what have you, aphids,
[24:26.000 --> 24:33.520]  all that. Yeah. What is the dilution that you recommend? Oh, great question. 10 milliliters
[24:33.520 --> 24:39.040]  per gallon is all you need. You don't really want to go too much higher than that, because we do put
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.760]  a real amount of essential oils in it. So with unlike my other ones that are very gentle with
[24:45.760 --> 24:50.880]  no oils, you can even go up to like 30 or 40 milliliters if you really want to feed the plants
[24:51.200 --> 24:57.040]  or whatever your approach is. But this one's potent, you know, you can even do five to 10
[24:57.040 --> 25:02.080]  milliliters. I wouldn't really go much beyond that. You know, sometimes we end up with some
[25:02.080 --> 25:07.120]  real heavy infestations and you want to knock them out, you know, start with 10. Maybe you want to
[25:07.120 --> 25:12.640]  bump it up to 15, but you'll start burning plants beyond that, because it is a really potent blend
[25:12.640 --> 25:19.200]  and you don't need much. When do you stop spraying that foiler? My goal, the oils you don't want to
[25:19.200 --> 25:25.360]  spray after flower, you know, so a week or two in. The other blend I have, the leaf tonic,
[25:26.480 --> 25:33.040]  that's something that's safe to use well into flower. It doesn't include neem at all. Just for
[25:33.040 --> 25:37.360]  the, you know, for anyone that is concerned with neem, I wanted to make sure to have one that does
[25:37.360 --> 25:44.880]  has no neem at all. So my goal and what I like to encourage people is to grow the healthiest plants
[25:44.880 --> 25:51.520]  you can before you flip. You know, that's where the magic happens. You're creating,
[25:52.800 --> 25:57.520]  you're increasing their own metabolism, their own immune system, and that's really what it's about,
[25:57.520 --> 26:03.920]  you know, get the plant to be healthy on its own. So that once you flip the lights, they have all
[26:03.920 --> 26:09.120]  the food they need in the soil, you've taken care of pests, you've increased their immune system,
[26:09.120 --> 26:13.760]  and you can just let it ride through harvest, just water only. Just water only. That's what
[26:13.760 --> 26:19.200]  I've done for years. You know, that's a nugget, dude. That's a fucking nugget. There you go.
[26:19.200 --> 26:21.120]  He's coming. We got our notebooks. We're ready.
[26:25.520 --> 26:31.040]  Just quickly, wherever we go, I think in the very short term, people are psyched to do a deep dive
[26:31.040 --> 26:37.200]  into both neem and soap nuts. So we can veer off on other topics, but I think people would
[26:37.200 --> 26:42.160]  appreciate lingering on those two. Like, for example, soap nut as a surfactant, right,
[26:42.160 --> 26:46.640]  like a replacement for yucca and other surfactants. Do you use it for that?
[26:46.640 --> 26:51.280]  Yeah, yeah. And that's why I have it in every single one of my new leaf tonic lines.
[26:52.320 --> 26:56.240]  Soap nut's amazing. And when I was experimenting with them all, we made a yucca extract,
[26:56.880 --> 27:03.680]  and it would not emulsify. Soap nut does, amazingly. It is the absolute best emulsifier
[27:03.680 --> 27:07.040]  I've ever used, period. You know, and I just say that for a fact, not because I want to sell
[27:07.040 --> 27:10.880]  products. And I wouldn't have put it out if it wasn't as good as it was. It blew me away.
[27:12.640 --> 27:18.880]  And yeah, it's saponins. Okay, so every plant creates saponins. A lot of these things we
[27:18.880 --> 27:23.280]  talk about, every plant creates them. Even, you know, we use aloe for salicylic acid.
[27:24.000 --> 27:30.400]  That's a plant hormone ubiquitous to all plants, you know. Some plants create a lot more than
[27:30.400 --> 27:36.960]  others. And soap nuts, they happen to create a shit ton. And it's commonly found in seeds.
[27:37.520 --> 27:43.920]  One example I like to use is quinoa. You buy it, it says rinse before using, and it'll bubble up.
[27:43.920 --> 27:49.200]  That's the saponins being shed off of the surface of the seed. And plants do that to protect
[27:49.200 --> 27:56.880]  themselves from pest attacks. Okay. So that's really what the tonics are about, is taking what
[27:56.880 --> 28:03.040]  plants create themselves to protect themselves, and concentrating it, preserving it, and allowing
[28:03.040 --> 28:09.600]  us to use it for any plant. So that's what saponins do in nature. And for whatever reason,
[28:09.600 --> 28:18.240]  sapindus mucurosae, the soap nut tree, creates a shit ton of it. And it's a husk of its seed
[28:18.240 --> 28:24.240]  to protect it. And it has a ton of different active saponins. You get into the chemistry,
[28:24.240 --> 28:27.840]  some of that goes above my head. I do the best I can in my research and understanding it.
[28:28.800 --> 28:36.240]  But besides acting as a surfactant and an emulsifier, saponins stimulate the plant's
[28:36.240 --> 28:43.680]  systemic acquired resistance by way of, the way they describe it, is tricking the plant into
[28:43.680 --> 28:48.240]  thinking it's being attacked. Okay. And this is where we talk about the plant's immune system.
[28:48.240 --> 28:54.000]  That triggers its immune system to create its own compounds that will deter pests from attacking it,
[28:54.000 --> 29:02.640]  basically making its flesh, its leaves, not tasty. And that's something that plays a huge
[29:02.640 --> 29:10.720]  role in creating the plant's natural immune system. So those are those little things we can do.
[29:11.520 --> 29:19.200]  We talk about with the whole no-till concept, the soil is the base. You can't do anything if the
[29:19.200 --> 29:24.880]  soil's not dialed in and they don't have the organic matter, life and minerals going in there.
[29:24.880 --> 29:29.200]  And then these little things we do to kind of, what I would describe as peak health,
[29:29.760 --> 29:34.800]  genetic potential. That's what I've always wanted to strive to see in my plants is,
[29:34.800 --> 29:40.880]  where can we push it? How can we use nature to grow plants even better than you can see in nature,
[29:40.880 --> 29:45.200]  so to speak? You know what I mean? Because we're creating a synthetic indoor environment.
[29:45.200 --> 29:50.800]  But let's take what nature's taught us, put it all together and see where we can push plants
[29:50.800 --> 29:57.360]  even beyond. It's really neat to see. It's all about-
[29:57.360 --> 29:58.960]  You've been showing that for years, Ian.
[29:59.600 --> 30:00.160]  Yeah. Thank you.
[30:01.760 --> 30:06.720]  All about getting that plant potential. So where do you get your soap nuts, my friend?
[30:07.920 --> 30:11.920]  Soap nuts, they're imported from India. They're organic soap nuts from farms in India.
[30:12.400 --> 30:20.400]  You know, it's a huge, huge growing market also just for dish soap, laundry soap.
[30:22.080 --> 30:30.240]  So we import them in ever-growing quantities. And because of that, because of how much we are
[30:30.240 --> 30:36.320]  using and how much we're going to be using, we're looking to partner with small farms and to create
[30:36.320 --> 30:41.920]  our own farm so we can start growing these inputs. And that's going to tie into the no-till
[30:41.920 --> 30:48.720]  gardening approach, having a farm lined with neem trees and soap nut, the citrus that we use,
[30:48.720 --> 30:56.640]  the citrus peels, and growing all of our inputs in a way that's improving the soil
[30:57.360 --> 31:00.160]  and improving the quality of the inputs we do use.
[31:00.640 --> 31:08.800]  So I understand that they grow very much in a humid, hot climate, the both neem and soap nuts.
[31:08.800 --> 31:12.880]  So how are you going to deal with that part? You're going to grow outdoors?
[31:13.680 --> 31:20.480]  We're going to get the farm where we need to be to do that. The location, I'm hoping to start
[31:20.480 --> 31:25.680]  documenting that process this summer, actually. So not going to talk about any specific location
[31:25.920 --> 31:34.240]  because that's not set in place, but we are gearing up to get on MOB, no-till gardening
[31:34.240 --> 31:39.520]  type of headquarters, into a farm and location that would allow us to grow these plants that
[31:39.520 --> 31:46.240]  need that humid, warm, tropical climate. We have a lot planned, and I'm really excited to start
[31:46.240 --> 31:50.080]  sharing that closer towards this summer when things start getting in line.
[31:50.640 --> 31:52.640]  Nice. Can't wait to hear that one.
[31:52.640 --> 31:57.920]  Definitely, man. Yeah, it's going to be awesome. And also, all based on being an education center.
[31:59.280 --> 32:04.640]  That's what it's always been, education process. As we learn to steward the soil better,
[32:04.640 --> 32:08.720]  to grow better food, to grow better medicine, we think that should be something everyone should
[32:08.720 --> 32:13.600]  have access to, from someone growing a plant in their balcony, backyard, small farm, large scale.
[32:15.760 --> 32:19.920]  That's the goal. That's what's really important for me, is to get our food and medicine growing
[32:20.800 --> 32:25.680]  in line with what the planet needs. Yeah, if you're going to actually create an
[32:25.680 --> 32:32.640]  environment like that, you should hold a Brianna. Michael had this guy that had crazy banana plants
[32:32.640 --> 32:37.040]  and shit. If you've got the environment, you should get some of those too. They were crazy.
[32:37.760 --> 32:42.240]  Oh yeah, definitely. Absolutely. Yeah, it's really interesting because what I've
[32:42.480 --> 32:50.080]  ... Talk about the phrase agroforestry and creating multiple canopies on a farm.
[32:50.080 --> 32:56.000]  And that's what I've done indoors on a small scale for years. That's what no-till gardening became,
[32:56.000 --> 33:01.840]  is having your cover crops, low-growing companion plants. And then cannabis is like your trees.
[33:02.560 --> 33:06.240]  That's your canopy. That's your shade. And figuring out what works together,
[33:06.240 --> 33:13.120]  how to maximize what you're growing to harvest more. The symbiosis of growing multiple plants
[33:13.120 --> 33:21.680]  together is huge. There's long been a ... Stemming from monocropping, stemming from these ideas that
[33:21.680 --> 33:28.880]  don't the roots compete. When really, when you pair the right things together, they all ... One
[33:28.880 --> 33:36.160]  plus one equals 10. So I'm really excited to take what we've done indoors and in containers and beds
[33:36.960 --> 33:42.160]  large scale and be able to document and show that way.
[33:43.520 --> 33:50.080]  That brings up a really good question. So when the canopy gets really big, it shades out
[33:50.080 --> 33:55.280]  the ground. So what kind of cover crops have you find that are very low light tolerant?
[33:57.120 --> 34:01.840]  There's two approaches to that. Some things you want to die back, right? Because you want that
[34:01.840 --> 34:10.240]  cycle to continue. So the clovers we're planting, things like that, as they grow along with your
[34:10.240 --> 34:15.440]  seedling or your clone you plant, and then the cannabis grows taller, just like a tree in a lawn,
[34:15.440 --> 34:23.360]  shades it and it suppresses it, makes it die. And then that's your mulch. And then your soil life is
[34:23.360 --> 34:27.920]  consuming that and it's returning it back. The minerals you may have put in the soil,
[34:27.920 --> 34:36.800]  they've consumed that and now it's returning as organic matter. And that's going to be more
[34:36.800 --> 34:42.320]  plant available. That's how it improves over time. Yep. Feeding plants.
[34:46.080 --> 34:52.000]  Do you still currently feed or at least growing a cover crop, you're still using a heavy clover mix?
[34:52.400 --> 34:59.280]  Yeah. In established beds, it's like a once a year thing. It's not necessary all the time.
[35:00.640 --> 35:05.920]  Once per cycle, if you build a new soil, I'd say once per cycle, coinciding with planting
[35:05.920 --> 35:11.840]  a few times and then back off to once a year kind of thing. Really, you don't need to go real heavy
[35:11.840 --> 35:20.000]  with it. Nature is fruitful. There's plenty available and we need to let the plants
[35:20.480 --> 35:26.880]  get it that way. And other stuff, buckwheat. Buckwheat's really great. I love buckwheat.
[35:26.880 --> 35:31.680]  It's fast growing, vigorous, creates a lot of biomass right away. Quick chop and drop,
[35:31.680 --> 35:40.000]  that kind of thing. And yeah, so lots of different options for indoors. Clovers are really nice.
[35:41.840 --> 35:46.320]  The dicondra people are playing around with a lot. That's really neat. That's more of a
[35:46.400 --> 35:50.560]  permanent living mulch, which is really cool, keeping that green bed on your soil.
[35:52.320 --> 36:00.800]  Alfalfas are neat. They'll regrow from root. So when I include a full mix on soil with alfalfa
[36:00.800 --> 36:03.920]  and it dies back, I like to keep little pockets that it'll start growing back.
[36:03.920 --> 36:08.400]  Then the corn, a little pocket of alfalfa, it'll grow for years. And it's doing its thing there,
[36:08.400 --> 36:11.120]  creating lots of biomass, chopping, dropping it.
[36:11.440 --> 36:17.680]  Ian, if we can, for the viewers, can you explain why Peter was getting to this as well?
[36:18.240 --> 36:24.240]  So many people are confused with neem. So many people are confused on why Coop will talk about
[36:24.240 --> 36:29.680]  that for six hours straight. A huge proponent he is, and that kind of thing. And there's a lot of
[36:29.680 --> 36:34.160]  other bright minds out there that are on the other side of that coin. So it'd be great to hear from
[36:34.160 --> 36:38.640]  you, sir, from your perspective, what you're doing. And I'm sure there's a lot of people
[36:38.720 --> 36:43.280]  It'd be great to hear from you, sir, from your own mouth, why you're using neem,
[36:43.280 --> 36:47.680]  why you're using neem oil, and then maybe some of the reasons why some of the misconceptions
[36:47.680 --> 36:52.320]  are out there, or maybe there is some validity to some of that, but you just talk about using
[36:52.320 --> 36:55.440]  a higher quality product or something like that. If you could just explain all that,
[36:55.440 --> 37:02.480]  sir, we'd appreciate it. Yeah. Neem's an ancient medicine. A lot of what we end up using is stems
[37:02.480 --> 37:10.480]  from Ayurveda. And that's a really, really neat fact. But with the neem, it's the plant creates
[37:10.480 --> 37:15.440]  these compounds, it creates relationships with beneficial microbes in the soil and on the plant
[37:15.440 --> 37:21.520]  itself. So that's what I take from it. The plant is creating compounds to deter pests and to
[37:22.320 --> 37:34.560]  encourage beneficials. So I think it's a beautiful thing. I'm not going to talk hours on it,
[37:36.080 --> 37:46.800]  but it's really effective. The plants benefit tremendously from it. So I think it's great to
[37:46.800 --> 37:54.320]  use. I've always loved using it. The fact that there's these certain products we can use for
[37:54.320 --> 38:01.200]  ourselves and in the plants, that's really important to me. When you use neem and toothpaste,
[38:01.200 --> 38:05.440]  shampoos, that kind of thing, when you can put it on your own body, I'm definitely comfortable
[38:05.440 --> 38:11.760]  putting it on plants. I mean, is there anything specific you wanted to hone in on about that?
[38:11.760 --> 38:17.200]  Dr. Pompa. I'll just chime in real quick. The one thing that I did when I did some research on it,
[38:17.760 --> 38:23.600]  it is a biocide. So it kills fungus, it kills bacteria. So I think that's the fear of it. I
[38:23.600 --> 38:29.520]  think that's why it's such a big divide between the two camps, the people who don't love it.
[38:29.520 --> 38:31.040]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Right, exactly.
[38:31.040 --> 38:33.040]  Dr. Tom Bilella Yeah. Health-wise,
[38:33.040 --> 38:38.480]  if you can brush your teeth with it, it's killing something. It's killing probably the bad bacteria.
[38:39.120 --> 38:39.760]  But you know,
[38:39.760 --> 38:43.840]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Let's letting your healthy biome continue,
[38:43.840 --> 38:51.840]  you know. And in the vermicompost industry, it's well-documented adding neem to your vermicomposting
[38:51.840 --> 38:56.640]  system increases the health and population of the worms, you know, and their diet is based on
[38:56.640 --> 39:03.680]  microbes, you know. So there is an incredible stimulation and healthy microbiology in your
[39:03.680 --> 39:09.040]  soil when you use neem. I mean, it is what it is, you know. There shouldn't be a fear about that.
[39:09.600 --> 39:16.480]  You know, it's heavily used in the carrot farming, you know, because it increases the flavor and
[39:16.480 --> 39:20.960]  color of your carrots and it deters the pest that would attack the root. You know, it's a very well
[39:20.960 --> 39:27.840]  established input in common organic agriculture outside of cannabis, you know. So–
[39:28.240 --> 39:31.280]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani And it lessens more with that kind of stuff.
[39:31.280 --> 39:36.480]  If you're talking neem, uh, Leighton's famous for, you know, not being a moron and putting
[39:36.480 --> 39:39.280]  too much on there where it's going to break down too quickly.
[39:39.280 --> 39:41.200]  Dr. Tom Bilella Exactly, exactly. You know,
[39:41.200 --> 39:44.880]  if someone was building a soil mix, we're talking about, you know, amendment per cubic foot,
[39:44.880 --> 39:50.480]  a quarter to half cup is plenty. And you know, just a sprinkling on your soil once a year,
[39:50.480 --> 39:52.000]  something like that, you know.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.320]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Neem cake, right? That's neem cake.
[39:54.320 --> 39:55.840]  Dr. Tom Bilella Neem cake. Yeah. Yeah. With the neem cake.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.640]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, exactly.
[39:58.640 --> 40:01.520]  Dr. Tom Bilella Well, again, people are so confused with that.
[40:01.520 --> 40:05.680]  A lot of people are confused with, you know, there's information out there that are saying,
[40:05.680 --> 40:10.560]  like, if you are boiler feeding with the neem oil, that is going to affect the overall quality
[40:10.560 --> 40:12.400]  production of the plant itself. So–
[40:12.400 --> 40:13.040]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Which–
[40:13.040 --> 40:14.720]  Dr. Tom Bilella You mind talking on that a little bit?
[40:14.720 --> 40:17.920]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani I mean, with a decade of use on neem,
[40:17.920 --> 40:22.160]  I've never– certainly never seen that. I've only seen an improvement, you know. So sometimes we get,
[40:22.160 --> 40:27.520]  like we have this conversation, it's just– it's a little baffling why it's an issue to begin with,
[40:27.520 --> 40:35.360]  you know. And so maybe, you know, it's such a great natural input to use. Why– why would some
[40:36.160 --> 40:42.240]  companies back research to– to bash it, you know, and bring a cold press oil into it? You know,
[40:42.240 --> 40:46.880]  it's documented that it's safe for bees when you, you know, you spray the cold press neem oil. It's
[40:46.960 --> 40:53.120]  not harming the bees, you know, the pollinators. But use a concentrated synthetic as Adiractin,
[40:53.120 --> 40:57.040]  yeah, you're gonna– you're gonna run into problems. So I do not recommend using those.
[40:59.360 --> 41:00.800]  You know, it's pretty simple.
[41:00.800 --> 41:02.480]  Dr. Tom Bilella Use nature.
[41:02.480 --> 41:05.840]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. You know,
[41:06.640 --> 41:12.400]  other options I use in my blend that we're actually reformulating some, the curangio oil,
[41:12.400 --> 41:17.200]  sister tree, you know, curangio oil is really great. And then jojoba oil, that's something I'll
[41:17.200 --> 41:22.640]  be introducing in one of my products. It's actually a liquid plant wax. It's really neat.
[41:22.640 --> 41:27.520]  And it's fungal– has fungicide properties in its own right. And that's a really neat one
[41:28.080 --> 41:34.160]  that I'm looking forward to– to incorporating into our products a little bit. You know, so yeah.
[41:34.160 --> 41:37.520]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani You had just mentioned the curangio meal.
[41:37.520 --> 41:40.720]  Shout out to Jeremy Silva of Builders Oil. It seemed like–
[41:40.720 --> 41:41.040]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani For sure.
[41:41.360 --> 41:46.640]  His videos and you, sir, were the first ones at least that I saw that were talking about that.
[41:46.640 --> 41:51.120]  You might be going deeper into what that is and why it's different than some of the
[41:51.840 --> 41:55.760]  nutrient benefits that's going to help build upon your soil system.
[41:55.760 --> 41:58.320]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, definitely. It works– it works with
[41:58.320 --> 42:03.840]  me. You know, it's– it's– it's another tree that makes a great oil. It's like a cousin tree
[42:03.840 --> 42:07.680]  to it and has different compounds, you know, and the research shows when
[42:07.840 --> 42:17.520]  I'm using them together that it– it has a exponential type of effect, you know. So curangio
[42:17.520 --> 42:24.240]  oils, curangio cake, those are really great, great inputs, you know. And it goes back to the seed,
[42:24.800 --> 42:29.040]  how important the seed is to the plant and that it puts these compounds in the seed to protect
[42:29.040 --> 42:33.680]  it from attack. You know, give it the nutrients, the high mineral content that a seed needs
[42:34.240 --> 42:40.800]  to– to start its life and then those compounds to– to deer pests from consuming them, you know.
[42:42.000 --> 42:47.040]  So curangio oil is another great one that I've used quite a lot over the years. There's been
[42:47.040 --> 42:51.360]  times when I'll go a whole year just curangio oil with my foliars back in the day and then just
[42:51.360 --> 42:55.840]  neem and I never noticed any difference at all. I– I would recommend or use them interchangeably
[42:56.560 --> 43:03.040]  with just as much confidence. And one– one point to make for people that live in cold climates,
[43:03.600 --> 43:08.960]  neem will solidify below room temperature, curangio doesn't, you know. So if– if that's an issue,
[43:08.960 --> 43:12.480]  then switch to curangio in the winter or whatever– what have you, knowing you're gonna have the same
[43:12.480 --> 43:19.840]  success. That's another bar there for– for people that have experienced that before. Yeah, definitely.
[43:22.320 --> 43:28.240]  Well said. Beautiful. So you– you feel like just, you know, again, not putting– not being a moron,
[43:28.240 --> 43:32.720]  but continuing to add those little amendments to curangio cake, meals, that kind of stuff,
[43:33.440 --> 43:37.840]  within your– you know, being smart about it. You shouldn't have any issues whatsoever.
[43:38.400 --> 43:44.480]  I've never personally experienced any issues at all, personally, with neem or curangio. In my
[43:44.480 --> 43:50.400]  gardens going on over a decade and in the gardens I've worked with and set up, you know, there's
[43:50.400 --> 43:58.800]  been obviously really big, you know, push against it. And it's– it's not something I can ever speak
[43:58.800 --> 44:07.200]  to personally seeing in– in any way, shape, or form. Not remotely, you know. So I– it's– it's
[44:07.200 --> 44:11.200]  one of those things, you know, I don't know where it comes from. I really, you know, I don't know.
[44:11.760 --> 44:17.040]  Overusing? Yeah, for sure, you know. Someone's gonna use two, three, four cups. Maybe they
[44:17.040 --> 44:22.240]  mismeasured and had a– had a big fuck up, then yeah, you know, too much of anything's not a good
[44:22.240 --> 44:27.680]  thing, you know. Well said. Right. Yeah. Well, you're here to hear first on future cannabis
[44:27.680 --> 44:32.000]  project, you know. It's nice to hear from, you know, guys like you that have, you know, not only
[44:32.560 --> 44:35.840]  doing the research and that kind of thing, but you're also in the garden doing it,
[44:35.840 --> 44:39.840]  having the experience to say like, you already hear the things I'm doing. And that's another
[44:39.840 --> 44:43.840]  thing that I've always admired about you, man, is you're always showing off your work. So for sure.
[44:43.840 --> 44:47.680]  Yeah. Things are working. Yeah, thank you so much. And that's played a big role, you know,
[44:47.680 --> 44:52.240]  figuring out, seeing firsthand what's working and what's not working, and then working backwards
[44:52.240 --> 44:57.280]  from there. Okay, let's dive into these textbooks. Let's figure out exactly what's going on,
[44:57.520 --> 45:03.280]  why is this working? Why is it not? Sometimes you see, you get some confirmation like, oh,
[45:03.280 --> 45:08.160]  okay, so that's what it is, you know. And other times you're still left, you know,
[45:08.160 --> 45:12.000]  a little confused. And there's a saying out there, I don't remember it exactly, but,
[45:13.040 --> 45:17.840]  you know, it's something about observation versus science and definitely, you know,
[45:18.400 --> 45:25.840]  real life observations, you know, come first. But just diving into the science of,
[45:25.920 --> 45:31.760]  you know, what I'd call no-till gardening, learning about the connections that the soil
[45:31.760 --> 45:37.520]  microbes from bacteria to fungi are making with the minerals, with the plant itself,
[45:37.520 --> 45:43.040]  you know, with the worms, with the larger life in the soil, it's super fascinating and super
[45:43.040 --> 45:49.520]  gratifying to have a little bit of understanding of the science that's happening, you know. And
[45:49.520 --> 45:54.000]  that's something I want to do more of going forward is get into a little more lab testing
[45:54.000 --> 45:59.840]  with the soils and how that relates to what's putting it out in the plant, you know. Let's
[45:59.840 --> 46:04.720]  test the soils with certain inputs, with certain cover crops before and after, and let's test the
[46:04.720 --> 46:09.680]  plants that it's putting out so we can start to quantify where are we seeing the benefits,
[46:09.680 --> 46:15.600]  you know, what is increasing yield, nutrition, terpene production, all of that, you know.
[46:16.240 --> 46:23.040]  So, we can combine first-hand experience with the science, you know, and I think that's where
[46:23.040 --> 46:27.200]  the magic's going to happen in figuring out the best way to move forward, you know, with this big
[46:27.200 --> 46:32.240]  push that we'd all love to see in regenerative and sustainable agriculture, you know, maximizing
[46:32.240 --> 46:39.920]  our outputs. Dr. Justin Marchegiani, brother. Amen. You know, it's like I've been screaming in
[46:39.920 --> 46:45.600]  desert for too many years saying test before, test after, see what your plant is pulling.
[46:46.240 --> 46:51.040]  Yeah. Monitor the results, keep notes, and then you'll just get better and better and better.
[46:51.760 --> 46:57.280]  Yeah. So, kudos to you. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, we want to get into that a lot more moving forward
[46:57.280 --> 47:01.360]  and you know, it's costly. You know, you can't just do one test and say, okay, this is what it
[47:01.360 --> 47:06.080]  says and we're gonna call it a day, close the book, you know. It's over and over and over again
[47:06.080 --> 47:11.120]  to see what was a unique situation and what's happening all the time. Well, the good news is
[47:11.120 --> 47:18.640]  Logan Labs are pretty cheap. I think the advanced is only 60 bucks. It's saturated paste as well as
[47:18.640 --> 47:23.600]  soil chemistry. Yeah. You don't really need to do texture because you're a low tension soil but
[47:23.600 --> 47:28.400]  for sure that'll still give you some incredible information uh about what's going on and then
[47:28.400 --> 47:34.880]  then of course leaf tissue tells you what it's what it's actually taken up from the ground and
[47:34.880 --> 47:40.560]  so combination of those things and again, you know, if you if you know that the leaf is or the
[47:40.560 --> 47:46.160]  plant is taking these things up then a common sense is just immense slightly. Yeah, absolutely.
[47:46.160 --> 47:52.160]  I'll be having some projects going forward on any farms we move into to document the soil. My
[47:52.160 --> 47:58.000]  friend, Dr. Anya Paltseva at the University of Louisiana, she's at Soil Expert on Instagram.
[47:58.560 --> 48:04.000]  I'll be working with her. Her specialty is heavy metals, you know, so I want to, you know, get into
[48:05.040 --> 48:11.600]  using cover crops to and increased organic matter and seeing how that's affected. I know that's a
[48:11.600 --> 48:19.600]  huge huge sometimes roadblock in in hemp or large cannabis fields, you know, where heavy
[48:19.600 --> 48:26.640]  metal testing is very important and we want to know how to curb the uptake in the soil and how
[48:26.640 --> 48:33.520]  cover crops I think can can help tremendously with that and organic matter tying up these compounds
[48:33.520 --> 48:37.520]  in the soil permanently or degrading them so that our plants aren't uptaking them.
[48:37.520 --> 48:43.600]  Yep, and that's fungi too. Fungi do a great job of that. Yeah, definitely pulling the nutrients
[48:43.600 --> 48:48.880]  out and it's always you can always sacrifice a hemp crop. Exactly, yeah, that's what's really
[48:48.880 --> 48:54.720]  interesting about it, isn't it? It in itself could be used for phytoremediation. Seriously,
[48:54.720 --> 49:01.200]  and then yeah, that's a quick down and dirty way to get your soil prepped for the for the real crop.
[49:02.320 --> 49:06.640]  Absolutely. Now did I hear you say that you've gone through kind of the ladder of,
[49:06.640 --> 49:11.120]  you know, going through super soil going through like a true living organics or you just straight
[49:11.120 --> 49:16.320]  knew that no-till was where it was at? The whole nine yards, man, from I'll tell you the first
[49:16.320 --> 49:22.240]  plant I grew was in a bag of soil I bought at Home Depot and some funky blue powder from Miracle Grow.
[49:22.240 --> 49:26.320]  I didn't know what I was doing, you know, 17 years old or whatever living in an apartment
[49:27.280 --> 49:34.240]  and the process of growing that plant in a foil-lined entertainment center with some shitty
[49:35.040 --> 49:44.560]  CFLs, that was the best three blunts we've ever had, you know, and it was shitty wheat,
[49:44.560 --> 49:49.440]  you know, but the process of having done it yourself and knowing we saved ourself 80 bucks
[49:49.440 --> 49:55.680]  that week, it really like put that fire underneath me and started, you know, I'm like, okay, this was
[49:55.680 --> 50:01.520]  amazing and I knew this was shit, you know, let's see where we can take this, you know, and I, you
[50:01.520 --> 50:07.520]  know, I knew I wanted to grow organic, I knew this is something I wanted to do, you know, eventually,
[50:07.520 --> 50:13.360]  you know, like as a living whatever and so, let's, okay, let's grow organic, okay, so what do we do?
[50:13.360 --> 50:18.320]  Let's buy some organic potting soil, let's buy some organic fertilizers, you know, everything
[50:18.320 --> 50:22.320]  out there, the earth juice, the, you know, all that stuff, I can't think of all the names now,
[50:22.320 --> 50:29.680]  it's been so long, BioCanna, that was another one I used for a long time, you know, and you look at
[50:29.680 --> 50:35.120]  the inputs, so you got these, you know, these liquid cocktails, you got, you know, there's kelp,
[50:35.120 --> 50:40.160]  there's guano, there's castings, you know, bone meal, blood meal, all these different things and
[50:40.160 --> 50:45.760]  it's like, okay, these are all amendments you can put in the soil, here's a liquid concentrate of it,
[50:45.760 --> 50:50.320]  you know, and then starting to learn a little more about the science of what's going on in the soil,
[50:50.320 --> 50:55.680]  it's like, okay, maybe if you get this stuff into the soil, then you're going to have a better time
[50:56.320 --> 51:02.000]  and that's what we're seeing for sure, you know, and then you also see, okay, microbes are breaking
[51:02.000 --> 51:09.840]  these down to their base elements, why do I need to put 10 different amendments that are
[51:09.840 --> 51:16.960]  all providing essentially the same thing, you know, so let's cut out all these different amendments
[51:16.960 --> 51:22.400]  and hone in on a few, you know, and then it's like, okay, it's not necessarily the plant amendments
[51:22.400 --> 51:30.320]  you're using, it's the minerals and what is it in nature? It's the combination of organic matter
[51:31.200 --> 51:36.800]  and rocks, minerals that are providing the nutrition, so maybe we don't even need so many
[51:36.800 --> 51:44.000]  of these plant-based or animal sea-based amendments, maybe we just need to find that ratio
[51:44.640 --> 51:51.760]  of minerals from rocks and organic matter to make plants healthy and that's where my, you know,
[51:52.480 --> 51:59.680]  rock dust, you know, I've pushed that for a long time now, you know, and that's a big part of
[51:59.680 --> 52:06.880]  how our soils became, you know, the planet is a rock, right, you know, and through weathering and
[52:06.880 --> 52:13.760]  microbial activity, the dissolution of those rocks enter the minerals into the soils, you know, and
[52:13.760 --> 52:18.880]  that's, and plants uptake it, the combination of minerals, microbes, organic matter and water,
[52:19.440 --> 52:24.560]  you know, that's where the magic happens, you know, then you want to get philosophical about it,
[52:24.560 --> 52:32.160]  you know, it's where did these rocks come from, you know, it's really fascinating to see the
[52:32.160 --> 52:37.680]  connections you can make between growing plants, growing ourselves, what our bodies are made of,
[52:37.680 --> 52:46.880]  how we use water, how plants use water, the minerals that have been broken down from the rocks
[52:46.880 --> 52:52.240]  and all this time, billions of years, that's how nature works on earth and that's what keeps
[52:53.120 --> 52:58.160]  plants healthy and that's what keeps our bodies healthy, you know, so I really love growing,
[52:58.160 --> 53:04.160]  simplifying the soils to basically organic matter and minerals, you know, often get asked,
[53:04.960 --> 53:11.120]  at what point is it too much, you know, well, as far as rock dust, native soils are up to 40%
[53:11.120 --> 53:15.120]  or more minerals, that's rock dust, it's not going to burn your plants, it's like having a really big
[53:15.120 --> 53:21.680]  pantry, you know, for them to pull from, so it's something you can't really overdo,
[53:23.120 --> 53:27.120]  they'll saved in the soil in the psych nutrient cycle until the plants need it,
[53:28.400 --> 53:33.680]  I've played around so much with using a lot up front to none and adding some as you go,
[53:34.240 --> 53:38.320]  you know, and more and more, I like the idea of starting out with a pretty light mix
[53:39.040 --> 53:45.520]  and adding a little bit at a time, you know, and that definitely mimics, you know, the cycles in
[53:45.520 --> 53:53.520]  forests of, you know, fall, you know, leaves decay, you got winter, it all goes back into the soil,
[53:53.520 --> 54:00.160]  yada, yada, yada, continue a little bit at a time kind of thing, so it's been really neat,
[54:00.160 --> 54:04.960]  a lot of fun playing around with the soil mixes and rock dust and biochar, we haven't even talked
[54:04.960 --> 54:10.480]  about biochar, that stuff's amazing and how that can play a role in nutrient retention,
[54:10.480 --> 54:17.040]  water retention, increasing microbial activity, it's really neat, so that's, as far as building
[54:17.040 --> 54:26.560]  a soil, that's where I've kind of came to have the simplest approach was with just a peat or a peat
[54:26.560 --> 54:33.760]  and cocoa 50-50 mix with a really good worm casting, compost, humus source, some rock dust
[54:33.760 --> 54:40.160]  and biochar, you know, and depending on how heavy of a watering can you have, add some humus or not,
[54:40.160 --> 54:45.360]  you know. And for the newer viewers that aren't familiar, if you can go to his website,
[54:45.360 --> 54:50.480]  you are gracious enough to share a lot of those recipes on your website. Yeah, thank you,
[54:50.480 --> 54:56.640]  mountainorganics.net, I have some no-till gardening and soil articles up there, the information is
[54:56.640 --> 55:01.120]  there, it's a little, you know, mix and match, I did it kind of like a journal kind of thing,
[55:01.120 --> 55:07.360]  so it's dated. We are going to be opening a new website soon, no-tillgardening.com,
[55:07.360 --> 55:12.560]  so I'm hoping, really hoping to have the time to update and expand on those articles,
[55:14.080 --> 55:18.160]  so definitely stay tuned for that, get the information now and know that we'll be updating
[55:18.160 --> 55:25.040]  and expanding on that information. Throw me some questions, you know, whether it's on Instagram
[55:25.040 --> 55:32.240]  or email mountain at mountainorganics.net, I'd love to hear, you know, what information is there
[55:32.240 --> 55:35.600]  that I'm missing that I'm not providing, you know, that'll really help fill in the blanks to give a
[55:35.600 --> 55:42.800]  more complete, you know, insight into what we do. That's a gift to the community for sure.
[55:43.520 --> 55:48.800]  Yeah, thank you. A direct question. I know you mentioned worms, we're, or at least myself,
[55:48.800 --> 55:52.720]  I'm a huge proponent on worms, I feel like that's where I was getting my success, is just continuing
[55:52.720 --> 55:57.680]  to build up the biofilm within that soil system. Are there certain composting worms that you would
[55:57.680 --> 56:02.880]  recommend, you know, do you use a symbiotic relationship where you're going out of your way
[56:02.880 --> 56:07.200]  to get white spring-tail mites and that kind of stuff to continue to break down organic matter
[56:07.200 --> 56:13.200]  with that, or are you simply just using composting worms? Yeah, worms are amazing in soils, and that's
[56:14.240 --> 56:18.240]  really funny because when I'm talking about soil mixes, that's, ends up needing, it's something to
[56:18.240 --> 56:22.160]  overlook, but definitely needs to be in there as far as adding a handful of worms in. If you're
[56:22.160 --> 56:26.800]  going to be growing no-till in beds or containers, and I've played around with doing, using both
[56:26.800 --> 56:33.440]  composting worms, which would be your red worms, and your European night crawlers. I used to add
[56:33.440 --> 56:38.880]  both and kind of see what, what's, how their interaction is, but more and more over the past
[56:38.880 --> 56:44.960]  several years, all I use are Uros. They burrow more, they have a more complete interaction
[56:45.680 --> 56:50.480]  with, with the body of soil and the plants in them and the life in them as far as being ecosystem
[56:50.480 --> 56:56.560]  engineers, and the larger aggregate they make compared to composting worms, and then save the
[56:56.560 --> 57:03.680]  red worms for your actual vermicomposting systems because they, they're a little more active in
[57:03.680 --> 57:11.680]  decomposing, you know, your compost or whatever you're adding to it, repopulate quicker and, and
[57:11.680 --> 57:17.120]  tend to be more surface dwellers, but it's really nice having the burrowing worms. I'm sure African
[57:17.120 --> 57:22.400]  night crawlers, if you're in a bit warmer scenario, would be great for that also. Having those larger
[57:22.400 --> 57:29.200]  tunnels to aerate, larger aggregate. Worms are amazing. They, they literally make, make the soil
[57:29.200 --> 57:35.440]  a better environment for, for the plants to grow in. You know, they're, like you said, they're biofilm,
[57:35.440 --> 57:38.800]  they're the mucus they leave behind and they're casting down in the tunnels. It's loaded with
[57:38.800 --> 57:43.680]  calcium carbonate, you know, so they're constantly making that available for your plants. They're
[57:43.680 --> 57:49.760]  increasing the diversity of, of, of your microbiology in your soil. I wouldn't garden without them.
[57:50.800 --> 57:55.280]  Yeah, you bring up another really good point is that if you're top dressing with your
[57:55.280 --> 57:58.640]  rock dust, they're going to help work that down into the soil for you.
[57:58.640 --> 57:59.520]  Exactly. Yeah.
[58:03.360 --> 58:04.800]  Let me get my glasses, right?
[58:05.840 --> 58:09.920]  That's what I've diligently been working on for the past, like, 20 minutes.
[58:10.160 --> 58:16.720]  It's like, I was like waiting for the moment. So we'll, uh, now we know why you've been so quiet.
[58:23.840 --> 58:27.520]  Yeah, man, worms, more worms, you know, get them in there.
[58:27.520 --> 58:32.080]  Yeah. I think especially starting out and getting involved with, you know,
[58:32.080 --> 58:36.160]  maybe you're making a few mistakes. It seems like if your worm populations are there,
[58:36.160 --> 58:39.520]  not too many, obviously, or almost like a Goldilocks approach with that,
[58:39.520 --> 58:46.000]  they'll self-regulate themselves. Um, just move forward with your farming. And if you do make
[58:46.000 --> 58:49.920]  certain mistakes, they're going to kind of help balance that pH balance that with those kinds of
[58:49.920 --> 58:55.200]  things. Obviously, like you were saying, they're, they're munching on the microbes. Um, so, you
[58:55.200 --> 58:59.200]  know, the more that everything builds up week by week, month by month, the easier that farming is
[58:59.200 --> 59:01.760]  going to become, uh, for you, numerous farmers out there.
[59:02.560 --> 59:08.720]  Yep. Absolutely. And that, um, that maturing of your soil is also, uh, it's holding more moisture.
[59:08.720 --> 59:12.240]  So you'll notice your watering needs go down, which is really important these days, you know,
[59:12.240 --> 59:16.480]  especially larger scale, you go, whether indoors or outdoors, increase that organic matter,
[59:16.480 --> 59:21.440]  increase that, uh, life in your soil and, uh, you'll be using it'll hold more water.
[59:23.680 --> 59:27.120]  You know, we've been talking to a lot of the other commercial farmers and the other thing
[59:27.120 --> 59:31.120]  that they really liked about that is it allows their team to now scope for things to kind of
[59:31.120 --> 59:35.520]  keep their head up from the soil system once everything's out. And now more management
[59:35.520 --> 59:40.320]  to try to scope and prevent and that kind of stuff, which you're paying a labor force. You
[59:40.320 --> 59:46.320]  really want them, um, looking down and up. And a lot of times when there's a lot of deficiencies,
[59:46.320 --> 59:50.640]  there's just issues. It seems like your team's just not there yet. Um, and that's why I've
[59:50.640 --> 59:55.760]  always really liked living soils because it seems like the team starts to buy into the system. As
[59:55.760 --> 59:59.360]  things starts to improve, they start to see for themselves. Maybe they haven't grown in this manner
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.760]  brand new to the whole system, but once it starts to hit those spraying leaves,
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:08.960]  once they have that overall just healthy vibe to the room, there really is a difference to this.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.080]  Yeah, absolutely. You know, um, and I always never, never want to discourage someone if they're
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:18.400]  having, you know, a little bit of bad luck on their first cycle or two, you give it some time,
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:23.600]  start understanding what's going on, you know, um, and, and, and once your soil starts to come
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:29.120]  together, um, then, then you'll see it becomes more and more hands off as time goes by and you
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:33.120]  can concentrate on other stuff, you know, let the soil take over, turn it back to nature.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:39.280]  You had mentioned bog before as one, you know, obviously that's somebody that you were growing
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:43.120]  and you admired. Uh, obviously I'm echoing that. Are there other breeders that when you
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:48.160]  first started out, you felt like, uh, we're at that same level? Um, you know, I've,
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:55.360]  no, and that's no disrespect. I've really kept to myself. I don't really know any other breeders in
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:01.680]  the game. I don't call myself a breeder. That's not what I set out to do. Um, and, uh, from,
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:09.040]  from that, I really just dove into, into the soil of it all, you know? Um, and Jim, Jim Koo,
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:15.200]  he became a great friend. Um, you know, and, and we, we discussed soils and genetics a lot. You
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.040]  know, my, my knowledge on genetics is not that extensive, you know, so you're not going to be
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:24.080]  asking me about, um, you know, other strains in the market. I've, I've been blessed with the
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:31.120]  gifts that I've, I've received over the years. Um, and, uh, that's, they've, you know, been
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:38.080]  pretty unique, pretty, really special. Um, and, uh, there came a point when I wanted to be able to
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:43.040]  offer those to the greater community, to the world. And that's when, when the breeding project
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:47.680]  started, it wasn't about becoming a breeder, doing this or that. It was about making something
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.080]  available that I saw wasn't out there. And I thought it was really damn special, you know,
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:59.040]  and old stuff, taking it back before all the hybrids, you know, um, re-infusing, um, the,
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:05.600]  the lineages today with, with, um, perhaps some, some characteristics that may have been bred out
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:12.080]  over time, you know? Um, there's definitely a big interest in, in, um, the land-raised genetics and,
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.440]  and express older expressions. And, uh, so I was really stoked, um, to be able to be in the
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.640]  position to work with those plants and, and start making things available, you know, and really
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.280]  happy that people liked growing them and still want to. Well, let's, uh, you know, let's dive
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:31.360]  deeper into that. I'm sure a lot of people, this is the part that they probably have been waiting
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:36.320]  for is let's dive deeper into the genetics. Um, and let's start off with one that I feel like,
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.560]  at least on Instagram and stuff that you are famous for is the Acapulco gold. That's certain.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:45.760]  Yeah. Let's talk, let's talk about that and deep dive into why that cut is so special.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.800]  I'm trying to come on, but she won't.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:56.400]  Hey, I was proud that she came on, uh, and she obviously, and she's a huge fan of you brother.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:01.840]  So, um, yeah, let's discuss why, why this cut is so important for everybody that's been able to
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.640]  be blessed with it. Yeah. You know, and I didn't, um, I didn't know how special it was when it came
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.760]  my way. It was really random. Um, and kind of an afterthought, um, I had started working with
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.160]  a local dispensary. Um, they liked what the product I had and that they were going to be
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:21.920]  able to have provide an organic, um, flower to their customers. Um, and so like here, you want
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.680]  to grow some of our stuff. We'd love to see this or that, you know, whatever cush this cush that
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:30.320]  cush. And then, uh, you know, the guy said, Hey, how, you know, want to try some Acapulco gold?
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:35.520]  No one, no one can seem to grow it well, you know? Um, oh, there you go. Yeah. Beautiful. Um,
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:42.240]  so, you know, I, it was clearly a different, different plant, really thin leaves, smaller
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:48.480]  structure, um, as a clone, um, it had not been grown organically for many years. Um, so I grew
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:53.280]  it, you know, there's no mention of it. It was just, it was growing it and, uh, flowers came
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:04:00.160]  out amazing. I loved it. Um, really, really strong, uh, flavors, um, sticky candy coated nugs, um,
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.920]  open structure, but very high quality. Um, I brought it back to him and, uh, you know,
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.760]  older guy, you know, twice my age. Um, and he stood back and he's like, Whoa,
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:15.120]  that's the Acapulco gold, you know? And he had to laugh to himself because he was like, you know,
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:19.680]  we were about to toss this and figure, uh, the guy was blowing smoke up our ass when he gave it to
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.080]  us, you know? And that's when he told me the story, um, going back to the eighties, that was
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:30.160]  a cut he had always wanted, um, uh, from an affiliate of his, uh, in South San Diego. Um,
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:36.160]  love that picture right there. Um, and, uh, they, they wouldn't let the cut out, um, you know,
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.720]  the small group of growers and that's all they grew in South, South San Diego, as it was described
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:49.120]  to me. Um, and from, uh, seventies into the eighties, um, the part I don't know is at which
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:54.480]  point they switched from growing from seed, uh, every year to selecting clones, you know,
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:05:00.240]  cause obviously things, things changed and things had to move indoors. Um, and he, he,
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.560]  he never gave him the cut going into the nineties and, and, uh, towards the early two thousands,
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:12.480]  I believe. Um, and, uh, so it was, he got a call, he tells me, um, and, uh, his friends,
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.880]  you know, basically on his deathbed as he put it, you know, and that's his dying gift. He,
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:23.200]  he passed it on, you know, um, so he was blessed to have it. Um, you know, so the cut does go back
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:29.280]  around 40 years. Um, and at that time in the, in the nineties, it was all hydro, you know,
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:33.920]  and this is a long flowering plant. It doesn't like, um, the heavy salts. Um,
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:39.200]  so no one could grow it well, you know, so it never, it's never put into production. Um,
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:45.200]  and they just held onto it. Um, and then it just landed, landed in my hands and I had it for
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:52.080]  several years, not really thinking about it too much, you know, and the more, uh, it was long,
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:56.720]  it was the, obviously the longest flowering cut I had, uh, when I was growing production, you know,
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:03.840]  so it was never in large amounts. Um, but I, I started to recognize people's reactions, um,
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:09.600]  when they tried it, um, and how rich the smoke is, how potent it is. Um, it's one of those,
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:16.640]  it's one of those unique flowers where the, the smoke tastes exactly like the plant when it's
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:21.760]  growing and the room will have that same smell for hours later. Um, and that's the musk aspect,
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:26.400]  um, to the terpene profile really ties things together and, and holds onto it and enhances it.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:31.920]  Um, so over the years I started, you know, started realizing, okay, this is something
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:41.280]  pretty special, you know, um, and, um, I wanted to, you know, put it into seed form. Um, and when
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:50.080]  I started, um, did my first breeding project and released in 2016, um, the first cross with it was
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:56.800]  what I called Maya. Um, and the, the thing about this Acapulco gold, it's about the cut, it's about
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.600]  what the cut has to offer. It's not about the name or about the strain. Um, so I didn't want
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:08.640]  to take other Acapulco gold genetics that are available now, um, and, and cross that
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:16.480]  lineage with it. I wanted to hold as much of just that cuts, um, you know, chemotype genotype as
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.960]  possible. Um, so I decided to work with something I was very familiar with, which is the Thai
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:28.720]  Afghans, um, and, uh, what I'd, what I call Lotus. Um, so that way with something I'm very familiar
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:35.520]  with, I can pull out the expressions and select specifically for the Acapulco gold and, and
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:40.320]  weed the Thai Afghan out. And it's, it's beautiful because those genetics are from that same era as
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:47.840]  well. I wanted to keep, keep true to that. Um, and, uh, so yeah, the Maya put out some amazing
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:55.440]  plants. The Acapulco gold is incredibly strong and dominant, um, in its crosses. Um, so after a few
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:03.280]  years of growing Maya, um, and, and seeing its, its, uh, expressions, um, wanted to select a male
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:09.600]  from that line as close to the Acapulco gold as possible and, um, took a year selecting that male
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:15.040]  and felt very, very fortunate that I don't think I could have picked a better pairing, um, because,
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:23.600]  um, so far 100% of the offspring in our BC1, the first back cross, um, strongly resemble the
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:32.320]  mother cut, um, as from being identical to 80 to 90% similar. Um, the, the flavor profile is really
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:41.120]  strong on the lemon, lime, pine, turpentine, and musk. Um, it, it tests high 20s THC with, um, upwards of
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:49.280]  6%, 5 to 6% terpenes. So it's a very flavorful, very potent, very dynamic, um, effect. And, um,
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:55.280]  I think this back cross, um, that's been available now since February, um, right now it's at low
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:01.120]  grown seeds. Um, you can hit them up for it. It'll be elsewhere soon as well, I'm sure. Um, I think
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:05.360]  it's something everyone should experience and that breeders should, um, you know, take a look at
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.640]  because it can add some really special, um, qualities to, to hybrids, especially when you,
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.360]  you want to cross old with the new, get that hybrid vigor back, you know, some pretty
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:23.280]  bitchin' things can happen. And then let's, uh, let's continue on, um, you know, Dan,
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.000]  I think it was the one and Lotus and that kind of stuff that a lot of people know you for as well.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:34.880]  Actually, before we jump onto that, people were asking kind of basics, like how tall does it grow,
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:41.360]  flowering time, stuff like that. Yeah. With the Acapulco, um, you're going to average, um,
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:48.000]  14 to 16 weeks as far as flowering time. Um, there'll be some, a little bit of, you know,
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  spilling on either side. Um, like, like these typical long flowering sativas close to land
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.680]  race, you're going to tend to get two flowerings out of it. Um, the initial burst and then around
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:04.880]  seven, eight weeks, you'll notice, uh, what people might associate most with Fox tailing.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:10.160]  Um, it'll do a second flowering with really beefs it up and, and you want to let it give it the time
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:16.720]  to let that part mature. You know, um, it tends to be a beast, a ton of lateral branching. Um,
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:21.360]  it'll grow more like a vine. You're going to want a lot of support. Um, nothing that's not
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:26.480]  manageable though. The more tops you have, uh, the shorter, the shorter in height it'll be. Um,
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:31.600]  so just consider what your, your height is. You might want to flower at a foot tall if you're in
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.320]  a tent kind of thing. Um, if you've got plenty of, plenty of space, uh, you know, two to three feet
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:42.320]  tall. Um, but again, um, clean up the insides. There's a ton of lateral branching. You're going
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:46.800]  to get a lot, a lot of bud sites and you're going to want to not let the plant take over
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:54.480]  in that regards. Um, she'll own you. She will own you. Um, she's, she's an amazing plant to grow.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:58.960]  Just be ready for it. Well, yeah. So that kind of leads into the next question,
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:04.160]  which is like anything finicky or tips and tricks, uh, for growing her specifically.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:10.400]  She doesn't like to be cold, um, warmer. Definitely. You might even let it get
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:16.240]  creep into the eighties, um, upper seventies at least. Um, she doesn't like to be cold. Um,
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:22.000]  not really anything else, you know, with, with the method of growing the soil and the inputs I use,
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.160]  I noticed pretty much every plant thrives in that regard. I, I couldn't tell you that,
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.160]  you know, this plant's a heavy feeder or that plant's a light feeder. You know, I just don't
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:36.480]  see that. Um, they all do very well. Um, you know, with the same approach in that regards,
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:43.120]  just a minute ago, Ian, the soil food web has taken over at that point.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:50.480]  So that you also now are managing and again, improving your team, teaching them about,
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:55.280]  uh, IPM, that kind of stuff. We had Mariah on last week, a shout out to her. You know,
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.480]  I feel like as more and more people are coming on and finding out about the show on Thursdays,
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.240]  uh, and finding out more about Peter's channel, uh, just learning from, you know,
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.360]  James loud on Sunday too. Like those guys were doing this when I was a young man and, uh, you
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:13.920]  were doing that as well. So it's, it's really fun to be able to sit here and pick your brain and
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:18.000]  see on a, on another level that it seems like the most part, everybody goes through their little
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.040]  trial there. Uh, yeah, definitely issues. Uh, but again, if we can minimize that,
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.360]  and you're definitely one of those, uh, that's, it's always given back, dude. So that's one of
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:31.040]  the reasons why I reached out to them. I appreciate you making your debut. Uh,
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.520]  yeah, it's an honor. Thank you. And then, you know, this live thing,
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:39.120]  are people submitting questions as we go along? You know, if there's things we don't get to feel
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.880]  free to shoot me an email with, with, uh, important questions that we may not get to.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:45.680]  I'm happy to do a post and address those. You see that one?
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:51.680]  Right on the screen. They were outcrossed at the tie Afghan. Did you outcross to anything else to
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:59.280]  cage? What, what's homogenous in the cultivar? Um, no, I didn't outcross to anything else. Um,
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:04.160]  you know, we did that initial cross. Um, I wanted to see how the Acapulco expressed in it, how the
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:11.760]  tie Afghan influenced it. Um, and then from there, use that to select for the Acapulco gold dominance,
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.920]  um, and put that back into the back cross. Um, and for a first back cross, I mean,
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.960]  she's strong in her lineage. You know, I couldn't be more happy with how she came out.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.240]  Are there more questions for the Acapulco gold?
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:32.080]  Uh, well, we'll wait for him to come in, but, uh,
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:39.680]  so how about, can we talk about the one that was, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Um, the last one there.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:43.680]  Uh, you were saying Acapulco gold was a drying technique?
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:50.720]  Or Acapulco, or sorry, the gold, gold, gold, the gold color. Yeah. You know, whatever the name is,
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:55.840]  it is, you know, whether gold meant top shelf or whether gold was that they dried gold. Um,
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:00.160]  you know, it's, that's a historical point. I don't, I don't really think that's, uh,
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.960]  you know, whatever.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:09.360]  It's a great plant. It's a great plant. Um, you know, this cut and, uh, how's the yield say in a
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:13.680]  100 or two gallon pot outdoor. If you can go full season and you got the, got the weather,
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:19.200]  it's going to be fucking huge. You know, you can grow 20 foot plants of this. Um, and, and, and,
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.360]  uh, yeah, a shit ton. Yeah, definitely. I mean, if you dry, if you dry in the sun,
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:30.080]  you're going to get gold buds. So yeah, no matter what it is. Um,
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:35.840]  yeah. Yeah. Can we talk about the one? Yeah, absolutely. Um, so, so those came from Jim,
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:42.640]  you know, everyone knows Coo, you know, CC Lumper dogs, um, you know, and, um, uh, I hooked up with
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:47.440]  him on the forums back in the day. You know, he was a great mentor. He's, he introduced me to NIM,
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.120]  um, to the, to the base soil mix. I always used, um, um, to a lot of this, you know,
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:59.600]  he opened a lot of doors in my mind, gave me the tools to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to,
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:06.320]  um, to, to vent, then, uh, go out and research on my own. Um, and was blessed with, with his
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:14.240]  gifts over the years, which included, um, you know, that cutting, um, the seeds, the, uh, the,
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:20.720]  the, the, what I call Gonzo, which is the one, and then Neville's, uh, Hay's Northern lights five.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:26.000]  Um, but the one, um, as his story goes, um, that that's a really neat. So he, he, you know,
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.140]  He worked for B OEL brotherhood of eternal love back in the day
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:33.160]  Bustin open the bales of the tie stick, you know
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.180]  Coming in and he'd save the seeds of the special ones, you know
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:41.100]  As he told me when when they'd get a shipment of tie
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.940]  All the bales would be the same but there would be one
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:50.820]  where the sticks the tie sticks were not wrapped were not wrapped with the
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.600]  silk threading but they were
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:16:00.120]  Gently folded in rice papers, you know, and that was what was called the dealer stash tie stick and never it never really hit the streets
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:00.820]  much
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:02.820]  So he saved seeds from that
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:08.420]  Saved seeds from the Afghan since you couldn't import cush not cush. I'm sorry hash
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.080]  hash imports weren't happening so they got acquired seeds from the Afghan and
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.640]  They were growing the tie in the hills in Santa Ana
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.960]  into the early 80s
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.920]  But because of urbanization and everything that was going on outdoor growing
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.180]  Wasn't gonna happen, you know much longer
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:32.760]  So they wanted to create a plant, you know, they they heard other people, you know
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.660]  Creating a better structured plant that can be grown indoors
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:44.520]  And the idea then was to take the high that everyone loved from the sativas and infuse it onto the Afghan structure
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:49.580]  With lower, you know shorter squat plants and and better flowering times
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:54.880]  So that's where his selection of the one came in in
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:59.580]  1983 the seed sprouted and the selection was made in January 1984
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.560]  and it's a
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:04.560]  night, it's an f1 land race
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.000]  1976 Highland tie 1971 Kandahar Afghan
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.160]  and
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.920]  You know, I was very thankful to be gifted the gift of that and different seeds over the years
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:21.560]  And with his blessings, you know started to to work with them, you know several years ago
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.080]  from the
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.880]  the
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:29.700]  What I call gonzo those were the to HNL 5
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:37.640]  They crossed that the original the one cut with Neville's 1988 Hayes Northern Lights 5
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.080]  And with the seeds I was gifted I
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:49.600]  Selected three pretty different plants and they were all really unique what I called the original gonzo blue gonzo and purple gonzo
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.720]  Between those the cut of the one
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.960]  the Acapulco gold and the J one I
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.200]  acquired
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.520]  Over the years as well from dirty herbs and old friend Jake
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:08.360]  That that was my lineup when I was growing, you know vending flower, you know and
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:15.240]  It's just you know, I said hey, you know, I can only grow so many flowers for for patients
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:20.840]  What if we can make see really get it out there because everyone loves them. It's a it's a unique different
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:24.280]  You know and product
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.360]  And I love the hell out of them. They're really potent
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:30.920]  It reduced my my mother collection from over 30 plants for those six
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:32.920]  Six or seven, you know
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:38.840]  So every everything I've worked with has been gifts over the years. I didn't ask for anything. I didn't buy any of them
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:44.920]  You know, so I definitely felt it was a good thing to be able to put them into seed form and get them out there
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.440]  You know
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:58.600]  I believe you crossed the one with the velvet rush. Yeah with the velvet with the velvet rush so
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:01.560]  Cross happened with Shawn dog in Hawaii
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:06.520]  He had the cut of the one and was sent the velvet rush seeds and that pollination
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:12.200]  Happened under the Sun in Hawaii and those seeds were sent back and I selected
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.080]  Males and females from those to create lotus. Okay, so a big part of this wasn't just to
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:24.520]  You know to to make crosses and put them out there. I wanted to do the best I could
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:32.120]  To unlock the genetics that were either locked away in the cuts themselves or within the seeds and really open it up
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:33.480]  Okay
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:40.200]  So in when you when you grow lotus, there's going to be a ton of variability because I intentionally opened pollinated
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:44.600]  for female and for male plants that each ranged from
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:49.880]  Purely afghan dominant to tie dominant and let them have at it. So
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:53.640]  16 ways and all the different phenotypes phenotypes you can get out of that
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:58.520]  There is an absolute ton of old-school variety in lotus
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:05.240]  And you can pull just about damn near anything out of it would be an incredible breeding tool to find something unique for yourself
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:09.960]  You know ranging from an eight-week afghan to a 12 14 week tie and everything in between
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.400]  flavors from from berries and grapes
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.840]  You know to what I would call the purple tie which is just
[01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:21.640]  A really really beautiful coming together of like floral
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.840]  aromas and spices lavender rose
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.800]  cardamom
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.840]  You know just there's a ton of potential in lotus
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:33.880]  So I'm really excited to see what the future holds
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:35.640]  for
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.240]  lotus
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.440]  and
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.120]  Cardamom
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:41.800]  um, you know just
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:47.640]  There's a ton of potential in lotus and i'm always excited to see people grow that one and I wanted that as the base
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.200]  for for my projects, um
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:57.000]  So I took that and pollinated all my cuts with those same four males, you know again because I wanted to unlock
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:00.840]  The potential in all of these so it wasn't about creating strains
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.720]  Um, it was about creating a vast
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:10.520]  Um, you know unlocking the potential of these old genetics, uh and moving forward
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:15.880]  We're picking out different expressions that we like or we think people would like
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.760]  um, you know and moving forward honing in on specific genotypes, so
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:26.520]  Um, the base has always been opening everything up having a lot of things, uh to pick from
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.740]  Um different genotypes that for people to experience
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:34.920]  And then hone in on on specific ones to get specific expressions into seed form
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.760]  Wow, that's cool, dude, that's badass
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:45.640]  Yeah, thanks, man. That's it's that's what I love. You know, that's like like I said, it's not about creating strains
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.640]  I really I I hated giving them names
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.520]  If you know anyone that bought for my first one, I wasn't going to call them anything
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.880]  It was just crosses but it's it's the way it is. You got to give them a name
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:59.080]  So I wouldn't really call any of them strains they're just crosses, you know, they're just crosses to
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.720]  to be able to put get you know
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:06.680]  Give a lot more people, um the opportunity to grow these and to breed with them themselves
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.400]  That's that's one thing. I love to see and want to see more of
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:13.800]  Um as people find something special their own and and and putting it into their own work
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:18.040]  well, these crosses are uh world renowned in the uh,
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:24.200]  The industry and I would say that that mob purple lotus that was something that I was just learning more about for me
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:27.720]  I'd discuss on the lineage of that. It seems like it's a pretty deep
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.600]  that one's really neat and um
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:34.760]  A lot of people would be surprised at how low thc the mother cut tested
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.920]  And yet it had a no ceiling effect
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:43.640]  We're talking 14 to 17 percent thc on average and yet from the mother's the purple gonzo. That's what i'm talking about. Sorry
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:49.480]  Um, so the purple gonzo is the one crossed to 1988 nevels hayes northern lights five
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.120]  um, and uh
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:58.360]  It it turns purple and it has those purple kind of flavors. Um, you know real rich, uh floral great berry
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:04.840]  um kind of flavors and uh, very euphoric no ceiling, uh, not a lot of couch lock type of
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:12.200]  type of effect, you know, and it was the one I would always describe as as being the strongest because it had no ceiling, you know
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:13.800]  um
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:18.840]  And then interestingly enough it tests lower. Um, so anyways, we took that to cross it to lotus
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.080]  So that's why you know, just trying to keep it simple
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:26.680]  Purple lotus is purple gonzo with lotus blue lotus with blue gonzo with lotus, you know
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.440]  And that one pumps out, um
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.240]  some incredibly resinous plants
[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:39.080]  And again that they range from the quick flowering eight week up to the 12 week
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.440]  Um, so in the quicker flowering one you add a much more
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:45.080]  pain-relieving narcotic type of effect
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:48.360]  Really really resinous bright vibrant rich
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.200]  Reds and purples, um in the flowers and then to that long flowering, you know purple tie
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.040]  uh genotype
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:01.320]  Um some great potential in that I want to dedicate some time to to make an f2s of that
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.800]  Um, there's so much so much there's a lifetime's of work
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:05.400]  um
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:09.800]  Just in in in these crosses, you know, which is why i've never made a push or
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:16.520]  You know interest in and bringing other stuff out there, you know, um, there's so much so much to pull out of it already
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:18.120]  um
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:20.440]  And yeah that purple lotus got a lot of potential
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:24.200]  Um, I also yeah
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.360]  Yeah, definitely. So, um because it takes, you know, it takes us so long to get
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.400]  To make them work through them
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.320]  I went
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:40.200]  Ahead and my stash of seeds earlier this year and just you know set aside exactly what I needed to work with and said
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:46.440]  Okay, it's gonna be a couple years. I know people like these let's do a quick little promotion. Um, so the purple lotus velvet sunrise and uh,
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:51.880]  Dark shine what I call. Um brought out in limited release for our 420. Um
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:57.480]  Sale a bit ago. Most of them sold out. Um, there's a few packs left so you might see them pop up here and there
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:02.120]  And uh another one that I noticed was the blues og can you kind of go into that one as well
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:09.640]  Yeah, that one was fun. So right around the time I was doing the first breeding my friend ryan and uh, np cali
[01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.640]  Um gifted me some cuts and some seeds. Um
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.600]  so, um the blues og
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:23.960]  Was from his sister strain to also marmalade. Um, and those were from seeds he gifted that were
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:28.920]  You know the quick flowering orange cookies cut with face-off og back cross, um
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.560]  threw them in there and
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.960]  pretty randomly happened to get
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:37.080]  Two females in particular one was
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:42.520]  A pure og expression. The other one was pure orange cookies. I'm like, this is kind of cool
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.880]  You know, so that was actually my first time playing around with uh,
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:52.200]  Taken, you know the new school and crossing with the old school. Um, so that was a fun experience
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:57.240]  And crossing with the old school, um, and that's when I saw that you can really get that really neat hybrid vigor
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:59.640]  um
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:04.840]  Pump some some of that, uh dynamic old school effects back into these plants increase the yield
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.000]  um
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  So the blues og. Um
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:12.280]  People that were able to get a few pack pulled like maybe 50
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.840]  50 packs of that out recently. Um, there wasn't much in the original release either
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.320]  um, but some really beefed up
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:20.760]  um
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.160]  Og plants, you know is what you'll find mostly
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.600]  with some some thai influence here and there um
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:32.840]  Translates to some really fruity cushy og skittles flavored kind of plants. Um,
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:36.680]  But a lot of just that pure classic og gas
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:40.680]  Um that people love, you know, um with with uh,
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:47.800]  Maybe some enhanced potency more dynamic effect and and where it really shines with some increased yield you get some spears on there, you know
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:52.680]  Um, that one sounded really interesting especially with the the face-off lineage in there
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.280]  Is there anybody that's been taking that and then creating a solventless?
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:58.280]  Concentrate
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:04.040]  Um, I wish I knew you know, um, I don't not sure i've seen any with that particular cross
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:08.280]  Yeah, hit us up please because that is one that I would love to see the finished product for sure man
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:13.560]  Hey and all of you anything you guys want to grow or use in any sort of documentation whatever just hit me up
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.360]  I'm i'm, you know, totally open to providing seeds
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.080]  Yeah, we appreciate that absolutely
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:25.800]  All right, uh, so here's the other thing that I always love learning on is what are the stuff that you're currently working on that?
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.800]  Nobody knows about yet
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.720]  Um, we're talking about genetics still yes, sir
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:38.520]  Um, yeah, like what what are you drawn to? What do you like to play with? What's what's your intent as a breeder?
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:44.760]  Well, I touched on that a little bit earlier. Um, like I said, there's already a lifetimes of work. Um
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:51.480]  And and in in the cuts and strains that I work with and the seeds i've made, um, so
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.680]  Right now if you follow, um
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:01.720]  My buddy johnny's at j bone mob that's at j underscore bone underscore mob
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:06.760]  Um, you'll be able to see the documentation of what we just you know called the eros project
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:13.160]  Um, so from the cut of the one we backcrossed it right with the same lotus that we've been talking about
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:17.240]  Um and had the first to bc1 the one bc1
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.080]  um
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:24.840]  And there was a lot in that there's a lot of really neat stuff in that and that was really important for me to dive
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:25.800]  into
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.020]  Because again that specifically goes to that cut from 1983
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:33.720]  You know, um, and I wanted to see what can be pulled out of there
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:37.960]  Um, and there's a lot of really neat different genotypes. So it's like, okay, let's
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:44.760]  Continue to break that out. So let's let's see all the variety that's coming out of these and um,
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:49.400]  and then select some really cool ones to hone in on and um,
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:58.920]  And start being able to offer, um stuff that is more more consistent with those genotypes. Um, so eros is
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:05.820]  Was veered towards the the tie hybrid side of the one bc1
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:13.100]  Um, so, uh, it's got it's got great structure. We wanted to avoid the wild tie plants in this cross
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:15.420]  we wanted to provide something that was uh
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:19.280]  You know more manageable, um had the hybrid structure
[01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:23.980]  And so we're growing that out right now selecting males and females
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:27.980]  And a big part of what I do is really I let the plants speak to me there
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:34.780]  You know, like I said, because we're we're unlocking old old lineages that even I may have not have seen. Um, you know
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:40.620]  Uh, so I want to let the plants really guide um in the selection and let them take
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:43.260]  Take the lead on that. Um
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:45.980]  So we're working on on that. There's more
[01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:49.980]  uh more different genotypes we want to pull out of um,
[01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:56.540]  You know the the the the one umbrella of of lineages. Um
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:58.060]  Um
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:04.700]  There's a recently we made citron which is the j1 that's a jack herrer and skunk cross from
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:10.460]  2005 and beyond I don't know exactly when um, that's a really incredible plant
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:14.300]  We want to do a back cross on that eventually so the citron. Um
[01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:19.420]  Is going to be the means to find the male to then back cross to the original cut
[01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:22.140]  So down the road, you'll see a j1 back cross. Um
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:26.460]  A lot of the acapulco going forward in the years, you know, um
[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:31.100]  The last several years have focused on the thai afghan and using that as a base
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:35.260]  With the acapulco gold back cross we're gonna you're gonna start seeing
[01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:38.460]  More of that as the base lineage
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:40.460]  um
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:44.460]  The purple lotus you talked on that. Um, we want to put more of that out. Um
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:47.900]  There's uh
[01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:53.740]  There's there's really a lot and it's gonna be years before we get to all of it, you know, but uh, i'd willing you know
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.980]  we can uh
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:57.820]  be able to get into
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:02.860]  position situations where we can quicken the pace on the breeding, you know, um
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:06.860]  And be able to do a lot more projects at once, you know collaborate with others
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:12.140]  Um, there's some really neat stuff that that people have approached me with um that i'll be sharing soon
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.700]  Um, that's gonna be pretty rad I think
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:18.140]  So how many are you talking on these
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:23.020]  What's that how big of a sift are you actually talking? I mean you're doing acres of this shit
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:28.540]  No, no. No, that's the thing. It's all small selection. I don't have the benefit of of doing that, you know
[01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:31.740]  Because that's a lot of variation
[01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:36.300]  There is a lot of variation. Yeah, there's like I said a lifetime's of work, you know
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:39.580]  So we take our time and and work with within the means that we can
[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:42.140]  I'm a genius man
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:50.940]  Normally normally layton talks enough where I could be doing this all day, but it's uh, he's so quiet today that I gotta
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:57.740]  My chops, right? No, i'm just i'm diving i'm listening to this. Uh, you know, he's doing some amazing
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:01.340]  You guys are interested. Everybody doing a good job here
[01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:03.980]  Absolutely, man
[01:32:03.980 --> 01:32:05.980]  Yeah, you're working with the real genetics, too
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:11.020]  I feel like a lot of us especially me when I first started, you know, I was driving over here driving to uh,
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:15.500]  The divide here in colorado to pick up certain genetics that I thought were tried and true
[01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:21.420]  You know driving them home flowering them out, you know, that's obviously months of time putting all that stuff together
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:26.460]  Find out that it's not the real cut or it's not what you thought would be and that kind of stuff. Sure
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:28.860]  It sounds like you've been able to
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:30.060]  Yes hone your skills
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:36.780]  But also have that soil system so dialed in that now when you are phenol hunting you're seeing those full genetic profiles and that's what
[01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:41.100]  Layton and myself are really big on trying to teach the newer farmers out there
[01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:43.520]  This is how you can kind of get a leg up on the competition
[01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:46.220]  that's with your
[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:50.540]  You bring up a a huge point because if you're not growing to a plant's potential
[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:56.380]  Then you're not being able to select properly, you know, um, you could toss something out because it doesn't branch out or whatever
[01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:59.580]  But it might it may be the environment or the soil or the condition. Um
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:03.100]  So yes, thank you. And I feel very grateful to be able to um
[01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:07.820]  At this point with with how old my soil is and and how dialed in it is
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:13.500]  um to be able to to look at how plants growing and know if it's to its potential or not, um,
[01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:17.180]  You know and when it comes to selections, you know people ask me like what do you look for?
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:19.180]  What should I look for? How do you know if it's a good plant?
[01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:23.900]  You know, don't stress yourself out find the plants that you like. What kind of plants do you like to grow?
[01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:28.860]  You know, do you want a branchy plant and select plants that are branchy certain flavors that you want, you know
[01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:36.300]  And and just start doing it, you know putting things together and seeing how they mesh, you know and seeing what comes out, you know, um
[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:41.820]  So there's different, uh different intents with different crosses, you know, the acapulco maya
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:49.340]  Maya, the the the thai and afghan added a great stronger structure to it. So you're not gonna have as wild of plants. Um
[01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:54.380]  And whereas the acapulco I I wanted to stay true to its vining nature
[01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:56.860]  So you're gonna get some wild ass plants in there, you know
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:02.220]  Um, not not the best structure for commercial growing, you know, so to speak. Um
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:09.340]  And long flowering but but that's what the plant is and that's what its history is and that's what I wanted to to offer
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:13.020]  You know, um, it doesn't always have to be the same thing, you know
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:22.860]  Nice that's that's that's what i'm talking about right there. Yeah brian. Thanks for uh, you know reminding the listeners
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:28.140]  It's all about starting with soil, you know, if you're starting with something that's shitty and you're feeding it new
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:31.660]  You're never gonna see what could come up with that plan. Yep
[01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:36.300]  Yep, and it blows my it blows my mind like that the thai afghan combo
[01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:41.020]  I mean the amount of lateral branching and tertiary branching you get from it is nuts
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:44.860]  It's nuts. You really got to clean these up when you get when you grow like, okay
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:48.460]  Let's psyche and arrows are both tobc1s, uh, tobc2
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:51.420]  Uh, especially those ones, um
[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:57.900]  The the how close the node spacing is and how vigorous it wants to branch out without topping it
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.020]  You'll get a plant with 50 tops, you know, and they almost all look even
[01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:05.980]  Um, and and you got to stay on top of it clean up inside. You don't need all that bushy undergrowth
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:10.380]  It puts out a lot a lot of biomass, you know, and it's really neat to see
[01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:17.900]  You know, uh, really really enhances the yield potential, you know, you get these really high quality good structured plants
[01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:22.700]  They finish in eight to ten weeks. They're potent. They have a unique terpene profile
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:30.140]  um easy to grow easy to bush out and um, you know, i'd love to see see, you know more of these cuts get passed around and
[01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:35.020]  And i've always stuck to myself, you know, i'm trying to myself to get get a hold of cuts and get them out there
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:37.100]  So don't be shy hitting me up for cuts. I don't care
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.100]  Wow
[01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:47.420]  Yeah, for sure always, you know everything was a gift to me I you know, it's it's
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:51.500]  That's what it is, you know, i've never i've never charged someone for a cut. I don't give anyone
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:56.540]  Ultimatums or you know requirements. It's a gift. Don't even ask me what to do it. You know, it's yours
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:36:00.140]  It's yours now you buy a seed you get your gift of the seed
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:02.620]  Um, you get passed on a cut
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:07.020]  Do what your heart says, you know more the merrier pass it around
[01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:09.820]  man, I wish everybody felt that way because
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:14.000]  98 percent of the trauma behind the breeders
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:16.140]  Yeah
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:18.140]  Yeah, exactly, you know, uh
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:21.260]  I'm working on my shit. Hey
[01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:26.140]  Probably going too deep on that aren't we late?
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:34.940]  No, it's good brother it's good it's you know, it's it's about it's about being whole being real, you know for sure
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:40.460]  Doesn't get more real than the holster
[01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:44.300]  Let me go get my shade so I can look like him, you know
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:48.940]  Yeah
[01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:54.700]  Well, what are some of the things in that you feel like going through the process like, you know with a super soil mix
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:58.700]  There was a lot of human error at least in my peer group when we were working with that
[01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:05.340]  Mix the nutrients correctly and then we would try you know, try your best and they we were using a kiddie pool in the basement
[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:10.460]  So I guess you can only mix so much but now that we're you know, everything is evolving
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:13.180]  We're getting more to now just letting mother nature take hold
[01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:16.060]  Are there some other gold nuggets that you can give our audience?
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:22.780]  That you feel like it's just kind of tried and true on something that is just as basic as you know, adding composting worms
[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:25.740]  That really makes a difference over the long long
[01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:28.700]  Yeah, yeah for sure. Um
[01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:34.380]  Most importantly make sure you start with quality humus, you know, that's like the most important building block of your soil
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:40.460]  Um, don't cut your corners there, you know ask questions, you know, wherever you're buying it from talk to them
[01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:43.340]  See what if they know about it? What are the inputs? What is it made with?
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:50.700]  You know is is the vermin is the worm castings you're buying made from like a you know cardboard, uh, you know paper recycling facility
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:53.500]  You know, how is it being made? What are their inputs?
[01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:57.740]  Um start out with the quality ones of that and then uh real importantly
[01:37:57.980 --> 01:38:03.500]  Don't fuck around too much with too many different things because then you're not going to know what's going wrong or what's going right
[01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:08.460]  Introduce things one at a time so you can gauge let things run a cycle
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:10.860]  You know give it give it the time
[01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:13.260]  Um really see what's going on. Um
[01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:17.980]  and that for me was helped the most in in um,
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:25.740]  And in being able to figure out what's working what's not and being successful with it, um less inputs more
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:28.460]  quality inputs
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:34.060]  You know, um, that's I you know kind of what it comes down to really
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:47.120]  Do you need worm castings if your bed already have worms not necessarily at all at that point
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:50.000]  It matters with the quality of your organic matter
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:53.760]  Is is the soil, uh kind of empty, you know
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:59.120]  Are the worms feeding have any nutrition to feed on if it already has worms and your plants want to feed?
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:02.720]  Then look at look at mulching, you know, look at cover crops
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:07.440]  Look at some top dressing the amendments because the worms are what's going to turn it into into food
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:13.440]  So maybe it just needs some rock dust top dress, um, maybe it needs more organic matter and you want to put down some mulch
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:14.560]  of straw
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:16.800]  Um some alfalfa whatever the case is
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:22.240]  but it's about the the nutrient retention at that point so you want to make sure the
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:25.920]  The worms have the food to turn it into plant soluble form
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:32.640]  Yeah, and you know what you brought up earlier too is if you're using compost worms, you're reducing your organic matter
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:37.360]  So you've got to add more back in whether you're growing it or top dressing it exactly
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:44.640]  Hopefully that is your question agrees. So yeah, and it's a Goldilocks approach again with all everything that you're doing on that
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:48.640]  So many people get excited like oh look at this now. I need to add this product other
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:52.640]  In deep in the research and find out about a variety of different things
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.120]  Uh, we always try to you know
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:00.640]  Let the let the newer farmers know that you just need a successful flip or a few successful flips
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:07.280]  then let's start, you know, really playing with with the formula if you will, but you know, like you're putting up, uh,
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:12.000]  The recipes and stuff on your website that kind of thing. That's those are tried and true things
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:16.640]  That's a gift. I feel like from from you to the community because a lot of time. Thank you. Yeah
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:19.840]  You know, nobody was sharing their recipes even right
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.680]  So, yeah, yeah, that's that was interesting to
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.800]  To step into the not sharing thing
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:33.280]  Yeah, I think for the majority sake the living soil crowd is is all about it for the most definitely
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.680]  Yeah, we all got to build each other up, you know
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:38.640]  That's what I mean, we're all
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:44.160]  For the most part gardening with mother nature, so it's not like there's some big secret that we got going on
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:47.440]  Exactly. That's what it's about for me, you know
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:55.920]  So just just quickly I wouldn't be me if I didn't bring on surprise guests and if our surprise guests can hear me right now
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:04.480]  If you're on a mac, uh use chrome instead of safari for some reason safari doesn't play nice web-based audio video apps
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:06.960]  And then uh
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:13.440]  Once you're on pick a camera source and an audio source, but uh, we got a little surprise for you in
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.280]  awesome
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:16.240]  so
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:17.280]  but uh
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:20.480]  Carry on with the with the questions and comments
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:27.040]  Um, you know I was gonna uh ask you ian have you ever played with um pit moss
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.240]  Pit moss is a
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.240]  Uh, no explain that to me
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:39.920]  All right pit moss what they're doing is they're they're making a peat alternative cool because you know peat bogs are are really special
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:41.600]  They're they're not
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:42.320]  well
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.240]  Understood as far as the environmental impact of removing and draining them
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:52.720]  And I think they're only three percent of the earth's surfaces are covered with mines. So akeland shut their minds down
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:58.000]  Uh canada's going, you know balls to the walls, but they're doing the coal tar sands, too. They right right
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:04.560]  Responsibility but so anyway, I met this this cat um who started that company back
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:06.860]  shit
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:07.900]  2010
[01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:09.280]  11
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:12.080]  Um, and he hadn't perfected the formula yet
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.960]  but since then they have
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:20.800]  um, and it's an amazing product and I have tried to get the word out that people should start looking at
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:24.880]  Alternatives to peat because as soon as you stop buying it
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:28.880]  Mm-hmm, you'll slow down the mining but you're not for sure
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:35.360]  My yeah, keep mining it until they just have so much sitting around that nobody wants it anymore, right? Right?
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:41.200]  You know, that's that's incredible. I do recognize the name now. I'd love to you know, shoot me a link or or whatever
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.200]  I'd love to look into it
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:50.720]  Absolutely, and you all saw the headline. I just threw up. Uh, my friend mick, uh sent that to me earlier today
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:53.280]  uh, which is that
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:43:00.160]  Starting in 2024 the uk is going to ban the sale of peat. Uh in product to gardeners
[01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:03.120]  Yes, mixing it in the soil and stuff like that
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:09.120]  Need for that for sure time to look for alternatives. I know on that side of the pond
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:10.560]  It's definitely been a much you know
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:15.920]  They have a much smaller access to a much greater issue and and the depletion of it's happened a lot quicker, you know
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.600]  Um
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:24.000]  Yeah, so let's look at more alternatives got to have those options and there's a great company called agro coco
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.800]  Uh, that's right here in la
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.100]  They're bringing up
[01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:31.200]  sustainably harvested coconut shells
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:39.520]  Uh, they don't press it over 2.2 pounds per square foot which helps tremendously in maintaining the shape of it
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.840]  And it's a lot of storage capacity
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:44.800]  It's not grown in brackish water so you don't have salt
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:51.200]  And of course, they're handling it properly. So they're not driving equipment and grease and you know fuel all over the flat
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.720]  Excellent. Very cool. Thank you for doing that work and bringing that up right now. Very well. Please it's
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:01.300]  I'm all about yeah, awesome doing the right thing. Absolutely
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:07.680]  Cool, um, so brian, was there any other question? Oh, he's got his face in the box
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:15.680]  What are you guys stabbing on in uh denver today some super fire creme brulee
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:23.120]  And from what I understand isn't that kevin's wonderland isn't that the originator on that one? Yep. Yeah
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:26.640]  So, uh
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:29.360]  When you're talking about genetics and that kind of stuff this stuff is
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:32.400]  A plus, you know
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:41.040]  Yeah, obviously genetics play a huge role in that end and that's you know, I guess if people would understand more what it took to create a quality product
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:43.040]  I think they would pay a little bit more
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.600]  uh, have you ever gotten food poisoning like I have from a
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:50.560]  Budget sushi place. Oh, you just don't ever go there anymore for sure
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:54.080]  I think if people understood more what like
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:57.840]  the quality of the food that they're eating and the amount of food that they're eating
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:07.200]  For sure, I think if people understood more what like this lit was um, yeah smoking that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yep
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:13.680]  Um, ian, I had a question for you do you grow veggies in with your canvas plants?
[01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:18.000]  Absolutely. Yeah, that's been a huge part. Thank you for bringing that up actually. Um,
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:19.280]  when uh
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.480]  when I started growing in the larger beds the 45s and 100s
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:27.680]  I wanted to experiment with the companion planting and just grow another shit in there because there's room for it, you know
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:31.680]  Um, so i've grown tomatoes that come out delicious
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:38.720]  They grow incredibly well in the same environment that canvas does with the same inputs and they become perennial in the grow room, you know
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:42.640]  Um, you could even trim them back to the stock and they just put up new shoots, you know
[01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:48.080]  You can keep them in there kind of permanently, you know, um cilantro's excellent to grow in there
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:52.000]  Parsley different herbs oregano does particularly well
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.560]  Peppers grow a lot of peppers in there
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:57.120]  Uh nasturtiums, I love to grow
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:01.920]  Um calendula marigolds. Those are all the you know getting into the companion plants. Um
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:08.320]  Beets, I you know, I let a beet grow too long on the surface and buried it and it was a little underwhelming harvesting it
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.320]  But it was a gorgeous plant. Uh
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:16.000]  Carrots are great to put on the perimeter radishes grow quick and easy. Um, you know
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:20.880]  Uh peas are fun. They grow really well around the perimeter of your beds
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:26.560]  Put some bamboo stakes or trellising what have you and uh, while the plants are young you can let those peas shoot up
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.560]  You know get a little bit of a harvest in a little snack in the garden, whatever, you know
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:34.080]  Even on a larger scale you can have enough to feed the family a little bit here and there
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:35.520]  um
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.760]  You know, and then when when the cannabis starts growing
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:43.760]  Growing taller just chop the peas down, uh mulch with it, you know, and it's a legume
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:48.240]  Of course, they're gonna get a little bit of nitrogen fixation going on with that, you know, so definitely
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:55.600]  You know get away from the monocropping grow more shit with it, you know, just grow more it all does well
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:01.680]  It's all fun. You learn so much more by growing more plants together. You see what what goes well?
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:07.120]  What doesn't go well, you know, and the more we can grow in smaller spaces the better off we're gonna be
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  You know
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:16.000]  Ever played with potatoes potatoes. Yes, actually, um, but and uh,
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:21.520]  Uh that it grows really well with it too, you know, and the potatoes are the little potatoes
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.520]  I've harvested out of the beds are really delicious
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:27.760]  Yeah, absolutely
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:31.040]  I'm a big fan of those root crops. Yeah. Yeah
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:34.560]  You got a question
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:41.520]  No, sorry. Yeah, I got a uh radical cannabis. Hey, what methods of masonobu fukuoka's do you use with cannabis growing?
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:44.580]  So that was a big part in looking at the philosophy
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:48.560]  Of of how he grows and trying to understand
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:54.480]  You know working closer with nature working with the processes of nature and then translating that to an indoor
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:56.000]  uh
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.340]  You know built soil, um environment
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:03.760]  The first thing I did was starting to mulch with straw, you know, literally. Um,
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.600]  and uh
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:11.520]  I've got away from adding straw to it because you just let the cover crops grow and die back. Um, but it's largely
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.720]  the philosophy behind what he does
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:22.480]  um and and and leading to the research i've done with the interaction with with humus and minerals in the plant
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:26.480]  Um and and looking at it in a way that okay
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:33.840]  Where am I screwing with the process that I don't have to you know his concepts of do nothing gardening?
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:38.240]  You know and that that that philosophy is not about literally doing nothing
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:40.880]  It's about seeing what nature does better on its own
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:47.760]  And and observing that and recognizing it and allowing that process to happen and stepping away from it, you know
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:50.480]  So when you go into no-till beds
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:54.240]  Um, you know, you're throwing all these ingredients together
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:59.840]  It it's not always necessarily going to be super conducive to explosive growth
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:05.200]  But with the right humus and the right minerals you do obviously get that really good growth from the get-go
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:11.280]  But all that stuff you're putting together all that life it needs to mesh and create its own ecosystem of its own
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:13.840]  Um, so that's what it's about
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.440]  um, and then
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:20.560]  You know the cover crops that was a huge influence from him in implementing cover crops indoors
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:23.120]  Which seemed kind of silly and people still laugh at you know
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:30.240]  Um, but that's what creates the mulch, you know, if there was if there was one bit of magic that's actually happening
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:35.600]  Um in these beds, it's that layer between the top of your soil and the bottom of your mulch
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.320]  Where everything's being consumed?
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:44.400]  And it's returning the death of previous life back into your soil in a better way, um
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:50.160]  you know, so so that's what it comes down to is that philosophy and looking at it and um,
[01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:55.120]  Simplifying simplifying the process as much as you can, you know
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  That's what I took from fukuoka
[01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:00.000]  Yeah
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:05.760]  I mean that is so true. It's that that finite layer between the two of them. It's just exactly
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:09.760]  Yeah, yeah, it's so neat to nerd out and watch
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.680]  What's that do you own a microscope
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:21.040]  No, but someone should tell me which one to buy because like I was talking about doing a much heavier testing
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:23.200]  Um, you know experiments in the future
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:27.440]  The microscope is one thing I want to add to that to be able to check shit out and see what's
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:30.880]  Uh, see what's going on there get a swift
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:35.760]  Okay, we're oscillating head so it's really comfortable to use and adjust
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:41.040]  Uh, and did you get it hit me up and i'll walk you through setting it up and how to how to use it
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:43.840]  Awesome. I love that man. Appreciate the suggestion
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:51.600]  Yeah, you're a huge guy dude for the community. So someone needs to get back. Wow, brother. Nice man. Thanks
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:58.560]  Oh, I saw a question pop up that says what do I like to smoke on right? Um, i'm a nighttime smoker, you know, um, so
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.800]  um
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:07.040]  I like to smoke on everything that I work with is what it comes down to, you know, I like all the different
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:13.040]  Uh, you know aspects that it brings all the different flavors so it's not necessarily a favorite
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:18.000]  It's it's what do I feel like tonight with that said the acapulco gold is
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:22.880]  Seriously unique and adds such rich flavor a really potent high
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:29.600]  You know cerebral euphoric borderline psychedelic kind of stuff, but it settles into a real pain relieving
[01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:34.400]  De-stressing, you know to help you get that good night's sleep. That's you know what I take it for
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:42.080]  Um, so all of them, you know, it's all the I love all the different flavors that that that uh cannabis can bring. Um,
[01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:44.960]  But that acapulco is special
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.120]  Are you dabbing that acapulco?
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.720]  No, that shit's gonna be gnarly we should we gotta get we gotta get that to you somehow. Um,
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:56.800]  When my um my friend
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:03.680]  You guys had brianna on last week, um and my friend, you know, michael hindon rest in peace, um amazing soul, um,
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:06.640]  he was really big into um,
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:13.440]  You know the concentrates and the acapulco gold was one that uh, he particularly enjoyed. Um,
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:16.320]  and so he was you know, whenever he'd come and
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:18.480]  um
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:23.920]  Stop by he'd bring a sample of that and the the hash rosen. Um,
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:28.960]  From that was it's seriously potent like like turpentine is the word he used. Um,
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:33.120]  Really really high terpene. Um, you could probably you know
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:36.560]  Burn through plastic with it. It's so strong
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:40.960]  You know, um
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:47.600]  Yeah, they shared uh, just how really important michael hindon was and obviously speaking with brie and
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:51.920]  Uh, what was the other gentleman's name excuse me cory mori
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:59.120]  Sorry about that. Cory. Um, yeah, I feel like we were able to kind of understand really behind the scenes of
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:01.680]  The work that he was work, you know
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  about the pump out and the fact that
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:08.720]  Brianna and cory are going to continue and you know live out his legacy through that work
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:13.760]  It's something that we want to be a huge proponent on on the show and we hope that more and more people are going out
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:15.840]  Of their way to support them
[01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:17.120]  Yeah
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:20.160]  Yeah, absolutely. She has all of my support through this, you know
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:26.240]  it was such a shock to hear hear what happened, um, and it made me really, you know, look back and uh,
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:32.560]  Very few people have been in my gardens at that time, you know and shared space with me here
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:40.160]  And he became a really close friend and uh, we didn't see each other as often. Um, but just his his energy
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:41.840]  um
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:44.800]  his his motivation where he wanted to go the
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:50.580]  The level that he wanted to research at was refreshing and we always had amazing conversations
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:53.120]  You know, and he was really into the genetics
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:57.840]  So, of course, you know when I got someone here that's that's into the plants i'm growing and into the method
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:00.240]  I mean we could talk for hours, you know
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.320]  and uh
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:06.100]  It was a lot of fun to talk to for sure very much. Yeah, absolutely
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:12.560]  Just love diving down the rabbit holes. Oh, yeah, and he always had a new rabbit hole every time we'd visit
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:20.080]  Oh, yeah, he was one of the few people that could could actually exhaust me. Oh for sure
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:23.840]  Yep, yep
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:25.840]  Yeah, I miss him dearly and peter. Why don't you?
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:28.800]  Why don't you throw up modern epigenetics?
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:34.720]  Uh logo so that the crowd out there can see it if you can find it while i'm looking for that
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:40.960]  Uh, our special guest has finally mastered, uh connecting so without further ado
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.560]  the general
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:46.640]  What's up? Oh shit
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:57.120]  Jim hey, can you hear me? I hear you buddy. Okay. I've got uh trying to
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:00.960]  Hook up a road microphone with their bizarre
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:09.120]  Fosse uh software i'll leave it at that. It's been a long time. Can you get my teeth?
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.560]  Um, I can I I wanted to say something
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:16.160]  Relative to uh
[01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:20.320]  The canadian deal because I know that one really really well
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:24.960]  there's an organization that's made up of uh
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:30.320]  Industry and government in canada
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:40.380]  It's called the royal canadian. Excuse me. It's called the canadian sphagnum peat moss association
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:49.720]  It's a part of government partly the industry there's only about eight or nine companies that are allowed to harvest
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:55.800]  The biggest one is uh, sun grow sun grow does more than all the others combined
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:00.600]  They harvest approximately 52 or 53 percent of the entire
[01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:03.460]  Allotment that's allowed
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:06.280]  and uh
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:09.640]  It's it's a harvest only happens once a year
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:15.720]  I'm not saying it's not a lot. That's not my point. My point is that once that harvest is over
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:21.320]  There's nothing more until the following year and that happens in when it's uh
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:29.640]  After the first freeze because you know those bales that we buy the 3.8 bales at home depot or
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:33.160]  You know wherever um
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:35.880]  Those are cut frozen
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:38.940]  And then they're wrapped so they're minimally processed
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:42.860]  And that's sphagnum
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:48.760]  Go back to your youth when you had tops and shake remember that
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:51.800]  So sphagnum is your tops
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:54.360]  And peat moss is your shake
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:58.940]  The shake is heated up to remove the water, but also to sterilize
[01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:01.720]  because the
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:03.720]  uh
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:09.160]  Nursery industry wants sterile. They're not doing moving and grooving soil
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:13.720]  They're going to hit it with their favorites ammonium nitrate and uh
[01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:16.740]  phosphoric acid
[01:57:17.160 --> 01:57:19.720]  The world's biggest harvester is uh
[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:22.440]  Belarus
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:26.920]  if you go down to florida like I did three years ago to look at inspect the uh,
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:29.560]  not inspect but uh
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:31.640]  Take a look at the caranja
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:33.960]  industry down there
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:39.400]  And I visited several nursery commercial nurseries and they were all using this horrible horrible
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:42.440]  uh peat moss out of belarus
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:49.560]  I'll leave it at that. Um, but I think there's a misconception that
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:58.040]  The companies that premier horticulture is the other big one you would know it as pro mix you probably see that in your
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:00.600]  nursery supply houses
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:03.000]  Uh sunshine mix that's a sun grow
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:06.860]  Uh black gold that's a sun grow horticulture
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:11.660]  And uh, yeah, I mean they just they divide it up
[01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:14.300]  uh
[01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:16.300]  as per the their allocation
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:24.220]  So if you go and look at at the uh, canadian spagnum peat moss association, you can see exactly who's doing what
[01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:26.300]  And how much they're doing?
[01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:28.700]  I hope that kind of uh, what's the word?
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:31.740]  Explains things. How's that?
[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:35.980]  Well, thank you for that my friend. Thank you. That's you know, it's important to hear
[01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:40.300]  about where these are coming from and the differences because yeah, I
[01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:45.180]  I did notice that spagnum would tend to be a little bit more held together
[01:58:45.740 --> 01:58:48.060]  Than just the regular bags of peat moss
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:53.260]  I didn't realize they harvested only in winter. I thought they were drained those things and harvest all year round
[01:58:53.340 --> 01:58:54.140]  No
[01:58:54.140 --> 01:59:00.480]  As a matter of fact if you were to go to that website canadian spagnum peat moss association
[01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:03.660]  and it's it's uh
[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:06.780]  Look they have an agenda like any other group
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:10.780]  Okay, but there is another side to the story. That's all i'm saying
[01:59:11.580 --> 01:59:14.380]  And about how how the allocation runs
[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:17.420]  And what percentage of the total?
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:20.780]  and when we get into the
[01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:23.420]  british isles
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:28.140]  That one is so riddled with politics because in ireland today
[01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:31.740]  Many many homes
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:38.540]  Cook and eat using peat moss as they have for centuries as a matter of fact if you're a scotch drinker
[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:41.180]  you would hear terms like
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:45.340]  Smoky, right a smoky flavor that comes from burning peat
[01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:47.900]  to cook the
[01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:50.780]  I'm, not a distiller, but whatever stage that is, right?
[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:55.200]  Right, and so you'll hear terms like it's got a real peaty
[01:59:56.940 --> 02:00:01.020]  Flavor profile this scotch over that scotch. Does that make sense?
[02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:08.620]  So those where those terms come from many factories built especially, uh warehouses built before
[02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:19.020]  You know like 1920s 1930s those are still heated with peat moss and so you have the politics of the yeah brits
[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:22.700]  and the irish and I won't even get into that as
[02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:26.620]  Yeah, I can't even figure out oregon and idaho. So, uh
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:28.380]  Yeah
[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:30.300]  It's really important to
[02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:36.560]  Recognize the the extensive use of peat outside of gardening when it comes to england and ireland and and the limitations
[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:40.300]  On peat harvesting in canada. They're only using a small area
[02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:43.660]  And all the points that you noted
[02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:47.020]  now there is one thing that was mentioned and I uh
[02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:49.740]  peat something
[02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:51.260]  pit moss
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:55.500]  Pit moss, is that the stuff that's made over in eastern washington from calvin?
[02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:56.700]  Or
[02:00:56.700 --> 02:01:02.540]  No, pit moss is basically, uh shredded papers cardboards. It's all okay
[02:01:03.420 --> 02:01:07.260]  That's there's a product. I want to warn you there is a product
[02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:13.600]  The guy's been banging around for about 15 years trying to make this work. He hasn't been successful
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:16.780]  uh
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:18.780]  I had some tested
[02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:22.540]  I guess it was four years ago. I've never seen
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:25.480]  Potassium levels at the same
[02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:32.860]  Which you already know when you use cow manure you already have a potential potassium issue of being elevated
[02:01:34.380 --> 02:01:36.060]  Levels that are not
[02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:43.500]  Conducive to a living soil. So if you see somebody trying to sell you something, well, no we've converted this cow manure
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:46.780]  Just get it tested
[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:49.340]  And I suggest that you'll find it
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:54.220]  And maybe you want to use rockwool and go back to hydroponics before you use that
[02:01:57.260 --> 02:01:59.740]  I'm half kidding, but I mean it's really it's really rough
[02:02:01.260 --> 02:02:03.260]  Um
[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:09.900]  Have you ever been playing or have you been playing with uh cocoa for no and uh
[02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:12.300]  You know
[02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:15.900]  There's a couple reasons not the least of which is the slave labor used
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:23.420]  In some of the production regions around the world the level of quality is all over the place depending on origin
[02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:26.700]  Uh, is it coming from mexico? Is it coming from?
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:31.100]  The caribbean are we southeast asia? We china?
[02:02:32.860 --> 02:02:34.460]  Um
[02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:39.420]  All those issues all those issues and a lot of the crap. Excuse me. A lot of the material
[02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:42.300]  Is used by the reptile crowd
[02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:45.740]  Well, that's fine, but that doesn't make it a good
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:49.640]  Skeleton for a soil
[02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:51.820]  um
[02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:53.820]  If I were going to move away
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:58.220]  One thing I learned from some of the people in great britain, uh, uk, excuse me
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:06.700]  Where it is a contentious issue is that they replace a lot of the organic people replace, um,
[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:09.660]  the peat with uh
[02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:17.180]  What we would call here compost thermophilic compost now that what you have to do there is you gotta up your
[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:21.660]  Uh, what do you call it? Uh aeration? Yep component
[02:03:22.860 --> 02:03:24.860]  but uh
[02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:27.520]  That if I were going to move away from sphagnum
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:33.820]  That would be the direction I would go and I would and I would choose what materials I wanted to go into
[02:03:35.100 --> 02:03:37.100]  that compost
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:43.180]  Like a leaf mold with something with structure that allows for air and water pathways into the soil
[02:03:43.580 --> 02:03:46.620]  That's my that's my biggest complaint about core
[02:03:47.420 --> 02:03:49.420]  Is it doesn't have that structure?
[02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:52.540]  And so you're limiting
[02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:54.860]  the aerobic
[02:03:54.860 --> 02:04:01.500]  Component of that soil. Does that make sense? Yeah, I got dude. I gotta get you a sample of this stuff out of mexico. It's super clean
[02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:09.660]  Uh, the structure is insane he can grind it coarse cross-cut he's played played around with this stuff for years
[02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:13.580]  Sure his latest mix or his final mix
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:21.020]  Uh, the course or medium course is amazing to work with and again, he doesn't press it over 2.2 pounds
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:23.500]  So the water storage capacity is there
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:27.500]  It's got plenty of potassium. So i'll get you some ships off
[02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:29.340]  Okay
[02:04:29.340 --> 02:04:31.340]  Yeah
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:33.340]  I haven't been growing now for
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:38.620]  I don't know four years I guess and um
[02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:42.060]  I'm uh
[02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:49.580]  Taking a position as production manager for a commercial farm here, which in oregon is 40 000 square feet. So basically an acre
[02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:51.660]  um
[02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:54.140]  On oregon licenses, you're not limited by
[02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:56.060]  plants
[02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:57.580]  plant now
[02:04:57.580 --> 02:04:59.740]  Nor does it have to be what's that word?
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:02.540]  If you have you have 40 000
[02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:06.220]  Square feet so you have 5 000 over here
[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:09.100]  The other 5 000 doesn't have to be
[02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:12.140]  next to that
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:16.540]  Anyway, you can have it a quarter mile away if you wanted
[02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:19.820]  You're limited to this square footage
[02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:23.740]  Contiguous or adjacent contiguous. Thank you. Thank you
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:28.540]  You need to go back to school take english as a basic second language
[02:05:29.820 --> 02:05:31.920]  Yeah, that's what I was looking for is contiguous
[02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:35.340]  So we can uh
[02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:40.140]  And unfortunately, you know you have to grow like the
[02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:48.380]  Donor told me hey, listen, man. This isn't woodstock. I have to grow with the dispensary's wine. I get it. I get it, you know
[02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:52.620]  Uh have fun and i'll just get i'll do your soil
[02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:57.100]  The big issue this year is because last year at the harvest in november
[02:05:58.060 --> 02:06:04.780]  We everybody the world is on shutdown so not everything not the same volume got through
[02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:09.420]  In normal years and right now go out and try to find
[02:06:10.380 --> 02:06:12.380]  a truckload of sphagnum
[02:06:12.700 --> 02:06:14.140]  best wishes
[02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:16.140]  Yep. Um
[02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:20.860]  Yeah, I I work with the largest organic supplier in
[02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:24.080]  The pacific northwest been around since 1938
[02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:26.160]  1938
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:27.520]  and
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:32.320]  I went over there a couple weeks ago trying to get two truckloads. They started laughing
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:37.400]  Yeah, right
[02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:39.960]  Try a home depot
[02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:43.400]  You know half a truckload out of home depot
[02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:47.880]  Don't laugh. I also got some out of ace heart where you know, I shipped a store
[02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:50.760]  You want to go where you know?
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:53.800]  Yeah, you know it's a little
[02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:56.680]  Southern oregon, so uh
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:02.920]  Yeah, it's really challenging and uh, there's a lot of growers in oregon and northern california this year
[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:07.960]  that are going to be knocking on your door if you got an alternative because
[02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:10.920]  This sphagnum thing is all is
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:18.760]  Even peapods because you know, they have contracts with the mackers. Excuse me the companies they pack for you know
[02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:21.000]  Nobody packs their own soil. That's a myth
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:24.920]  Uh, it's all outside even the largest
[02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:27.640]  seller of uh
[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:29.640]  Is none other than miracle grow?
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:32.440]  I think about it
[02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:39.640]  So I don't even know let's say it's 2 000 stores 2 000 home depots, I think that's probably
[02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:44.920]  Pretty accurate. Okay, we're close close enough
[02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:49.240]  So think of all the bags of sterile that are sitting in each home depot
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:54.200]  And then think about the number that are sitting in their distribution centers
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:57.480]  And then think about how much is on the road moving
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:08:00.700]  to those distribution centers from the packers
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:05.640]  It's a lot I wouldn't call it soil but it's a lot of dirt
[02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:14.520]  In those bags and uh, I was over at the home depot. We've got about I guess six here in portland
[02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:18.280]  and man, it was like bare bones just
[02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:24.040]  Like you can shoot a cannon through that part of the garden center and not hit anything
[02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:27.160]  so
[02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:28.840]  Yeah, everything
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:30.840]  Covid screwed up everything for sure. I mean
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:32.760]  Oh, absolutely
[02:08:32.760 --> 02:08:38.680]  The uh, the core that I've I have a project right now that i'm doing where I brought a truckload of pit moss in and a
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:40.520]  truckload of flora
[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:45.480]  The core still hasn't gotten here yet. It's been a month and people just there's no drivers
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:47.960]  You know nobody wants it
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:51.400]  So even if you got it across let's say you you popped it over
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:54.920]  from uh on the west coast most of
[02:08:55.560 --> 02:09:02.860]  Your materials coming out of alberta if you look at a map, that's another thing of going to this canadian spaghetti peat moss association
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:05.800]  Is it shows you who?
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:09.160]  Which companies are allowed to harvest and then what?
[02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:15.800]  Provinces and if you look at a map of the united states, you can go. Oh, yeah alberta. You don't ship it from
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:21.000]  Uh, nova scotia to the west coast, right there's no money
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:28.520]  Um, even rail, you know canadians are gonna you should have planned better, you know, uh
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:31.800]  That's kind of how it works
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:35.880]  Yeah, it's trucking is an issue. That's for sure more so now than ever
[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:38.120]  Yes
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:41.640]  But I know I know pit moss is able to move material quickly
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:43.320]  Sure
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:46.920]  They're they're I ordered that a week later. I got it. Um
[02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:49.640]  And they're gearing up to ups upscale
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:56.040]  So that they're manufactured and more of it and hopefully at some point we get an la moss out here
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:00.040]  But as far as
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:02.440]  Frank and the core, you know, like I said, I ordered it
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:07.640]  Probably well, maybe not a month maybe three weeks ago and it still hasn't landed at the at the soil blender yet
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:13.400]  So i'm trying to not trying to be negative but if you get it before
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:17.960]  July
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:23.080]  Then you got a patron saint sitting on your uh shoulder
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:33.320]  Well, the good news is this isn't for a cannabis farm, but um, so i'm i'm good I just meant in general I mean
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:36.200]  i'm talking about uh
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:40.560]  In oregon
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:43.520]  The big packer is sundrome
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.120]  Right just about 20 miles south of portland
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:51.840]  And if you were to go there and do their 25 cent tour
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:54.720]  You'd stand there and go
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:58.960]  You packed that oh, yeah, they don't pack their own
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:03.360]  You pack that too because you're up on the catwalk, right? Yep
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:08.480]  And you see these bags just coming out and they're staged all over the yard
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:12.240]  There's a truckload going to hell. Yeah, you get the idea
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:19.760]  And uh, it's kind of like so when you listen to bs, uh from these clowns. Oh, yes, we uh, we have uh,
[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:21.860]  pinpoint
[02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:23.860]  Proportioning you do
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:26.000]  What does that mean?
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.360]  You know i've been around soil for the better part of 20 years
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:32.880]  I never heard that term till you just popped it off on a
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:35.840]  weed board somewhere, you know
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:38.400]  pinpoint proportioning
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:41.860]  You know how long it takes to do an entire truckload
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:47.920]  These measures are augers big augers and they have comb bottom tanks hanging over the
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:57.360]  Chamber right and so the operator keys in the production number and so much of this drops in
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:03.840]  Some are going to have vermiculite, you know, you get the idea of whatever the recipe is eight minutes
[02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:07.120]  You're doing an entire truckload. That's the mixing time eight minutes
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:09.680]  And then it leaves that
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000]  And goes to another machine
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:15.520]  That costs about a quarter million and it bags it
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:20.720]  And now the bags come down and this is the first time humans ever touched this
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:26.960]  You stack the bags on the pallet and then shrink wrap them wrap them and then take them out to the yard
[02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:29.280]  And drop them in position for loading
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:36.800]  And you're going to tell me oh no we've got this down to where we have equal distribution of the line
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:40.080]  Let's see a truckload. That's a
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:42.880]  22 pallets
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:46.480]  54 pallets of
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:49.840]  54 bags of pallets. So let me do my reference here
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:53.040]  So you can do 1100 bags and nail it down
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:57.840]  You know where that limestone is yeah, that must be really good
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:01.280]  You guys must be really good
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:04.400]  What was it 10 point accuracy
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:07.600]  Yeah, no 10 point 10 point
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:18.320]  Cool what does that mean exactly what are they saying that that is that they can what they're saying is that if okay
[02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:23.600]  Let's say you're gonna mix a truckload. So that's 22 boards at 54
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:27.520]  There are two there are two yards each each pallet
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:31.360]  So 22 would be 44 cubic yards
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:36.160]  And let's say you're gonna make i'm i'm guessing here. Let's say you're gonna mix in
[02:13:37.020 --> 02:13:39.020]  300 pounds of uh
[02:13:40.860 --> 02:13:47.920]  Limestone or the stoner's favorite dolomite because you know for those magnesium hungry plants, which I've never figured
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:50.880]  out what that means
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:54.480]  Um, you're gonna get that 800 pounds
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:57.040]  And think about a truckload you got a 40
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:13:59.600]  42 44 footer
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:04.800]  And you're gonna get 800 pounds equally distributed from front to back and top to bottom. Sure
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:07.760]  Sure, you're
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:13.280]  So what you been up to coot you've been hanging or you're
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:19.520]  Just trying to get this uh had to go down there and talk to my crew that was fun
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:24.240]  I'm, sorry young enough to my grandkids. I hadn't um
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:31.920]  So like are we gonna do uh, you know now first we're gonna speak english. Okay first just for starters
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:41.200]  If that's a problem maybe you know go to the adult learning center and sign up for an esl class
[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:49.760]  And uh, we can move on from there but I got the uh, I had them build uh
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:54.160]  What they use in commercial nurseries for uh
[02:14:55.740 --> 02:14:57.520]  Propagation
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:03.040]  You think about this, you know organs sell seven and a half million christmas trees a year and they're all grown from cuts
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:07.040]  I promise you they're not doing them in easy cloners. That's a promise
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:12.640]  Because you're selling seven and a half million that means you got to do eight million right for losses and
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:15.760]  You know, oops
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:17.840]  So eight million cuts every year
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:24.560]  What you get the idea and that's just not even talking like nursery stock
[02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:30.640]  Monrovia nursery their facility out here does 10 000 cuts a week
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:35.520]  Because they ship them to other part of their uh operations. They have uh
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:42.560]  Eight thousand or nine thousand acres and something like ten states dylan wanted to say hi guys
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:49.200]  He's been walking around with a plant he planted outside, this is my son dylan. He's nine years old. He's been helping in the garden
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:52.240]  Nice. Yeah. Anyway
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:56.080]  They've been creeping around watching
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:02.580]  So the other way that i've been able to reduce uh, pete moskies
[02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:06.180]  Is that uh, and I have the
[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:09.360]  legitimate not logan labs
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:15.560]  legitimate agricultural lab analysis, you know where you're measuring cation exchange
[02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:18.840]  You're measuring anion exchange capacity
[02:16:19.780 --> 02:16:21.860]  You're measuring, you know, blah blah blah
[02:16:22.740 --> 02:16:23.620]  and
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:26.500]  Five-year-old soil is the so-called coot's mix
[02:16:27.940 --> 02:16:31.860]  Is still off the charts because it improves it's a living soil
[02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:36.440]  So yeah, you need to do some amending but not much not this insanity
[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:39.620]  um
[02:16:41.060 --> 02:16:46.200]  My opinion is that too much of the cannabis tree is is focused on a chemistry
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:50.600]  And exercising chemistry and not botany or biology
[02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:54.260]  I agree with you 100 my friend
[02:16:55.220 --> 02:16:57.380]  Yeah, we got both of them. How you doing buddies?
[02:16:58.100 --> 02:17:04.820]  Say hi, come here. I don't know if you can hear them. I got my microphones in this is julian here. He's my youngest
[02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:09.140]  They're both avid gardeners helping me being rascals keeping me on my toes
[02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:15.060]  The show's going long. So they definitely been creeping around wanting to say hi. All right, see what's going on
[02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:21.940]  All right guys
[02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:25.700]  Just quickly what's each of their favorite vegetables to eat?
[02:17:26.660 --> 02:17:32.660]  Uh kale julian, he eats the leaves right off of the plant outside and uh, dylan loves his peas
[02:17:32.980 --> 02:17:36.340]  He he's always going in the garden. We were talking about growing peas. I grow them for him
[02:17:38.420 --> 02:17:39.780]  Nice
[02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:42.980]  So yeah coots. I totally agree. I mean the way I look at soils
[02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:47.220]  It's three pieces one is the physical sandstone clay and organic matter
[02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:52.580]  Second is the nutrient or chemistry and lastly is the biology and if you're not looking
[02:17:53.540 --> 02:17:57.140]  Under those three specific parameters you're missing a third of it
[02:17:57.780 --> 02:18:00.420]  So i'm glad you said something like that. I mean it's you know
[02:18:01.460 --> 02:18:04.340]  People need to start looking at things differently is is my point
[02:18:05.780 --> 02:18:08.180]  Well what I can say is this
[02:18:09.620 --> 02:18:12.020]  For the last 20 or more years
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:15.920]  Cannabis production
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:23.440]  Has been focused on the western on the west coast because that's the only place that was legal or kind of legal or you know
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:26.320]  and then some
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:29.680]  So in oregon, you have families out there. I've been growing weed since
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:32.640]  You know the end of world war two
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:38.720]  Uh families, you don't just go grab 10 acres in southern oregon go. I'm going to grow weed
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:41.840]  well, you might want to talk to your neighbors that
[02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:44.720]  Your grandfather was growing it, you know
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:51.440]  So as more and more states become legal, can you imagine
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:54.640]  moving to alabama
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:57.620]  to grow weed or mississippi
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.640]  I mean have you ever been to tulsa in july?
[02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:07.680]  And now you got jersey with santino and uh
[02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:10.800]  my cousin anthony
[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:12.320]  I mean
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:13.760]  geez
[02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:16.000]  So but what it is going to do I think
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:21.060]  Is de-emphasize the west coast production
[02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:24.080]  Because who cares?
[02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:26.160]  They're not trying to grow
[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:28.400]  You know dankity bank
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:31.200]  You're just growing shit. That's going to go into a uh
[02:19:32.380 --> 02:19:34.160]  dispensary
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:38.960]  You know, there's a place at the end of my street, you know pre-rolls two dollars for a gram
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:43.040]  So, let's see. It's like nine hundred dollars a pound growth
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:45.360]  that's like
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:47.360]  45 years ago
[02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:54.080]  I mean 45 years ago tie sticks were 3200. That was the price of a brand new honda civic
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:59.360]  So you see what i'm saying just the price is just going to keep because
[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:07.280]  What's required of cannabis today is really you don't have to have anything that good
[02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:12.720]  If you go to these dispensaries around fortnight, I mean it's abominable it's just
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:16.320]  I don't know. I wouldn't smoke it
[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:21.040]  I hear you my friend the shit burns the back of your throat
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:24.720]  And this whole thing about hash doesn't hash
[02:20:25.760 --> 02:20:28.080]  You know, it's you may call whatever you want
[02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:31.120]  but you know hash is
[02:20:31.500 --> 02:20:34.580]  Thousands of years old right? But now it's been reinvented
[02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:41.600]  No, we can isolate the turps. Can you name five terpenes for me? Oh, no. Okay
[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:45.780]  So, you know just five out of the 360
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:52.640]  You know cannabis plant and probably more but you know, you get the idea. Yeah, we're still fine and shit for sure
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:55.920]  Well, you know a plant can take and okay. Let's say
[02:20:56.880 --> 02:20:58.880]  I'm, just grabbing some water guys. Excuse me
[02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:04.480]  Let's say a plant has created uh pining for example
[02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:08.240]  And along comes a
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:11.760]  An invasion of a pathogenic fungi, right?
[02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:21.680]  That plant can take that pining which is a pesticide or
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:24.800]  Yeah pesticide
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:26.800]  And convert it to a whole different
[02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:32.160]  Terpene or terpenoid that's a fungicide in a matter of 15 minutes
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:35.360]  And if you were to take a list of all the major
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:37.920]  ones that the uh
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000]  cannabis crowd likes to talk about
[02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:42.160]  they're all
[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:44.160]  carbon hydrogen and oxygen
[02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:48.160]  period
[02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:54.160]  Hydrogen carbon and oxygen period look one up right now if you can look up piney
[02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:56.480]  Look up little
[02:21:56.480 --> 02:21:57.920]  look up uh
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:21:59.120]  camphor
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:01.680]  Which is actually a ketone, but anyway, you get the idea
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:04.560]  And so I can okay in a tree
[02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:07.200]  some not all conifers
[02:22:08.080 --> 02:22:14.960]  Produce both pinings alpha and beta if a boring insect like a beetle
[02:22:16.860 --> 02:22:18.880]  Violates the the uh
[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:21.680]  bark structure
[02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:26.900]  That tree will take alpha and beta pinings combine them and guess what you get turpentine
[02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:30.240]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:31.280]  so
[02:22:31.280 --> 02:22:33.280]  the idea that we can
[02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:37.060]  Manipulate terpene and terpenoid production
[02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:41.760]  By some magical juice, whatever the latest one is, uh
[02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:44.560]  Is is pretty funny stuff
[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:47.840]  I mean it's
[02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:49.840]  It would be funny if it wasn't so serious
[02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:54.400]  And in the in the uh the chase to try to get
[02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:57.600]  You know a specific terpene
[02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:02.880]  I'm, not sure you can do it. So I mean, I don't believe it but that's neither here nor there
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:05.440]  Some people are spending a lot of money
[02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:08.560]  You know from uh buying into that
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:11.520]  uh myth
[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:19.040]  That if you just get this jug at eight hundred dollars a gallon and dump it on here, you'll have uh terpene heaven or something
[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:26.400]  What's that old expression right you can't make a suck purse out of a sow's ear
[02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:29.760]  You know shitty genetics is going to create shitty pies
[02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:32.640]  It's just the way it is
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:35.520]  I'm into that my friends
[02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:40.560]  So true so let's talk vermicomposting because that's what i'm setting up
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:43.520]  um
[02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:46.240]  The
[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:49.520]  Way that I learned and the gentlemen that I buy from
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:55.120]  And recommend highly it takes them two two years to two and a half years to take
[02:23:56.240 --> 02:23:58.660]  Organic matter and turn it into vermicompost
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:02.400]  First you go through the thermophilic cycle
[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:10.480]  Then nine months to a year, uh mesophilic where you're rebuilding the nutrient profile and the uh
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:16.480]  The biology micro colonies in there
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:18.640]  now
[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:20.640]  Now you have something worthy
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:23.220]  Of putting into a vermiculture
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:28.160]  Process but these things take time
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:31.520]  and um
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:34.880]  You know, you'll get a bag of willie the worm
[02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:39.600]  And you kind of get what you paid for, you know
[02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:43.860]  Good good thermophilic, excuse me good vermiculture
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:48.560]  Processed material costs some money
[02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:56.640]  Around this part of the world because of all the organic unrelated to cannabis i'm talking about or we have the highest
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:24:59.120]  per capita
[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:01.120]  acreage of organic production
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:03.520]  of any state
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:08.960]  So there's a lot of demand for these better quality materials, right that you might not have in say
[02:25:10.140 --> 02:25:12.560]  Oklahoma or texas or something like that
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.120]  But the average price here is four to five hundred dollars a yard
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:19.920]  So that's 27 bags
[02:25:25.090 --> 02:25:27.090]  27 27 bags
[02:25:28.050 --> 02:25:31.410]  What prices do you guys see for good, uh, uh
[02:25:32.370 --> 02:25:35.670]  Worm castings, they're not worm casting but vermicompost
[02:25:38.050 --> 02:25:40.690]  We're all about uh making our own teaching
[02:25:43.170 --> 02:25:50.370]  Yeah, it takes like two years to turn pure castings and there's a whole bunch of evidence that that wouldn't even be a goal a worthy
[02:25:50.370 --> 02:25:51.810]  goal
[02:25:51.810 --> 02:25:57.330]  To have pure casting that's why if you start with compost good quality compost that you could take
[02:25:58.130 --> 02:26:01.410]  And grow plants with right and then run it through
[02:26:02.370 --> 02:26:06.130]  The vermiculture processes think of it as value added
[02:26:06.930 --> 02:26:13.590]  Yeah, so that way you don't have to do that. You don't want to do you wanted about 66 to 70 percent castings
[02:26:14.690 --> 02:26:16.690]  because
[02:26:17.570 --> 02:26:21.510]  The longer that you leave it intact in a vermiculture environment
[02:26:23.090 --> 02:26:26.290]  There's less food because bacteria isn't gonna
[02:26:27.490 --> 02:26:33.090]  Because that's the only worms can eat is is is worms can eat is bacteria poop
[02:26:34.370 --> 02:26:39.090]  You know, it's not like well, they're serving peach melma at the other end of the bin. Oh, okay
[02:26:39.330 --> 02:26:44.370]  So we'll go down there. It doesn't work that way or people tell me well, you know, my worms really like melons
[02:26:44.690 --> 02:26:46.870]  Let's see melon is about 99.4
[02:26:48.050 --> 02:26:49.490]  water
[02:26:49.490 --> 02:26:51.490]  So once you remove the water
[02:26:52.690 --> 02:26:56.770]  And as magical as worms are they can't turn water into castings, okay
[02:26:58.290 --> 02:26:59.490]  So
[02:26:59.490 --> 02:27:01.490]  Here's a better example
[02:27:01.810 --> 02:27:07.650]  This one actually had a friend of mine. He worked with me in the pro. I was in the produce business for decades
[02:27:09.170 --> 02:27:11.890]  So he went and bought a box which uh
[02:27:13.170 --> 02:27:15.170]  of organic apples
[02:27:16.050 --> 02:27:21.810]  Forty dollars i'm only gonna make these really good castings. I said forty dollars, huh for 40 pounds
[02:27:22.610 --> 02:27:25.330]  Sounds pretty good. Oh, let's check this
[02:27:27.490 --> 02:27:29.650]  So apples including the skin
[02:27:30.450 --> 02:27:32.450]  uh runs about
[02:27:32.590 --> 02:27:34.590]  90 percent water
[02:27:35.170 --> 02:27:37.590]  So, let's see 90 times 40
[02:27:38.850 --> 02:27:40.850]  So 36 pounds cupcake
[02:27:41.730 --> 02:27:43.730]  Is water so you paid?
[02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:45.730]  40 dollars
[02:27:45.730 --> 02:27:49.330]  for four pounds of material that the worms can actually
[02:27:51.570 --> 02:27:53.490]  Turn it into castings
[02:27:53.490 --> 02:27:55.330]  They better really be good
[02:27:55.410 --> 02:27:58.610]  Because you got an expensive road ahead of you
[02:28:01.810 --> 02:28:03.810]  Better hope you hit the lottery
[02:28:05.170 --> 02:28:07.170]  You're not gonna make any money on those castings
[02:28:07.570 --> 02:28:08.690]  No
[02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:15.410]  So you got to start you can't you have to you have to start like, you know, everybody's done this you got to start with good
[02:28:15.970 --> 02:28:17.650]  carbon nitrogen
[02:28:17.650 --> 02:28:19.650]  Strong in my opinion
[02:28:20.050 --> 02:28:22.770]  Is the least offensive that you don't have to be concerned about?
[02:28:23.730 --> 02:28:26.710]  Um the vermicides that are fed the livestock
[02:28:28.530 --> 02:28:33.090]  You know, uh, they kill all worms or at least suppress them
[02:28:34.530 --> 02:28:38.290]  So with straw we grow a lot of grain here so I can get straw
[02:28:39.090 --> 02:28:43.330]  Well used to anywhere. Uh, pretty pretty straightforward to get straw
[02:28:44.450 --> 02:28:49.410]  And then there you go, but it takes time, you know, and every you know people in this thing want it
[02:28:50.290 --> 02:28:55.650]  I want to do the finish mix, but can't we do it in like two weeks? No, but you know, have fun trying
[02:28:56.770 --> 02:28:58.530]  so
[02:28:58.530 --> 02:29:00.530]  Yeah, everybody wants everything now
[02:29:02.130 --> 02:29:04.130]  You know, yep, so
[02:29:05.170 --> 02:29:07.170]  How did you guys meet each other
[02:29:07.570 --> 02:29:08.850]  Yeah
[02:29:08.850 --> 02:29:10.850]  How did you guys meet?
[02:29:11.170 --> 02:29:13.170]  The old forums icy mag
[02:29:13.650 --> 02:29:17.090]  So you guys were just talking on uh, icy mag and overgrow or
[02:29:18.130 --> 02:29:21.010]  Yep. No, it was a icy mag. Uh was
[02:29:21.650 --> 02:29:24.530]  The first one that was a front for uh,
[02:29:25.250 --> 02:29:29.250]  Gypsy, I don't want to see the birth certificate on this one for gypsy nirvana
[02:29:30.130 --> 02:29:31.650]  and uh
[02:29:31.650 --> 02:29:35.250]  He had two seed operations this seed bay
[02:29:36.210 --> 02:29:38.210]  and uh the seed boutique
[02:29:39.250 --> 02:29:41.250]  so, uh
[02:29:41.810 --> 02:29:45.890]  At one time just the organic soil section had like 24
[02:29:46.530 --> 02:29:49.250]  Posts a day just in the organic soil section
[02:29:50.210 --> 02:29:53.890]  And so a lot of people, uh, that's where jeremy silva
[02:29:55.010 --> 02:29:58.050]  From build a soil he posted under
[02:29:59.170 --> 02:30:01.970]  Mile high guy or something like that. Yeah, that's right
[02:30:02.690 --> 02:30:07.250]  And uh to see who else came out of that. I mean just a lot of people, you know
[02:30:08.450 --> 02:30:09.650]  and
[02:30:10.130 --> 02:30:17.810]  And uh, yeah jeremy was smart he wrote he uh took note of what I wrote and that started a business
[02:30:19.250 --> 02:30:20.530]  so
[02:30:20.530 --> 02:30:22.530]  So that's where he got his recipe from you
[02:30:23.170 --> 02:30:24.210]  Yeah
[02:30:24.210 --> 02:30:25.570]  Nice
[02:30:25.570 --> 02:30:27.570]  There's a little nugget
[02:30:28.690 --> 02:30:30.690]  He has his own he calls it the coops mate
[02:30:31.730 --> 02:30:33.730]  So does it?
[02:30:33.730 --> 02:30:35.730]  I taught paddy on a mixed soil
[02:30:36.370 --> 02:30:40.290]  And his father was the one that did almost all the pictures in that
[02:30:42.290 --> 02:30:45.410]  Book, uh teaming with microbes with long fills
[02:30:46.450 --> 02:30:47.250]  so
[02:30:47.250 --> 02:30:50.050]  Uh, I had to teach his son how to mix soil
[02:30:52.530 --> 02:30:56.290]  And then I tested it to the first few batches of kiss organic soil
[02:30:59.730 --> 02:31:01.010]  And um
[02:31:01.010 --> 02:31:03.810]  I just had what I said. He said what do you think I said?
[02:31:03.890 --> 02:31:06.450]  My review is i'm not going to be changing anytime soon
[02:31:07.490 --> 02:31:09.490]  so, uh
[02:31:09.970 --> 02:31:11.570]  I believe
[02:31:11.570 --> 02:31:14.130]  From experience that I don't think you can make a good soil
[02:31:14.930 --> 02:31:16.930]  You put in a plastic bag
[02:31:17.490 --> 02:31:20.930]  And run it around the country on the back of a flatbed
[02:31:21.730 --> 02:31:25.070]  in weather
[02:31:25.550 --> 02:31:28.030]  There you go, I mean think about it would you take
[02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:35.160]  Let's say you had 20 pounds of really prime bud
[02:31:36.680 --> 02:31:41.800]  Would you put in a plastic bag and run it from the west coast at uh, new jersey
[02:31:44.040 --> 02:31:46.040]  Wouldn't be the same would
[02:31:47.640 --> 02:31:52.520]  Yeah with soil what it comes down to is the interaction with plants and how you treat it going forward so
[02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:56.920]  Even if it's not the best soil to begin with you put it into a system and treat it
[02:31:56.920 --> 02:32:02.280]  Well, and you can build any soil quality, you know cover crops amendments environment and all that
[02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:04.920]  So I think that's what people should take away
[02:32:06.680 --> 02:32:08.680]  From the approach moving forward with it
[02:32:09.160 --> 02:32:11.160]  Well, we'll have to agree to disagree
[02:32:14.280 --> 02:32:18.520]  You know, I've had every premium soil sent to me over the years
[02:32:19.720 --> 02:32:24.120]  You know, I went through what I got into. I mean I got into it before
[02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:27.240]  probably some of you guys were born but
[02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:29.720]  you know the second time was uh
[02:32:30.280 --> 02:32:31.140]  like
[02:32:31.140 --> 02:32:33.080]  2008 2009
[02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:38.040]  And that time if you were a complete idiot if you weren't using fox farm ocean forest
[02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:40.200]  Okay
[02:32:40.200 --> 02:32:42.200]  And then their goofy happy frog
[02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:46.520]  and then even sillier one which was nothing more than perlite and
[02:32:48.280 --> 02:32:52.440]  Peat moss dust called light warrior and they mixed it all together. It was called
[02:32:53.960 --> 02:32:55.960]  Remember that stupid thing. Oh
[02:32:56.440 --> 02:32:58.200]  moonlight mix
[02:32:58.200 --> 02:33:01.720]  And I asked the guy online that I see man he was pregnant
[02:33:02.600 --> 02:33:07.400]  Did you guys go and get drunk on a friday night and come back at three in the morning put this together?
[02:33:07.960 --> 02:33:09.320]  Seriously
[02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:11.160]  Is that what this is?
[02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:14.040]  Okay, and some things you can't fix you can't fix
[02:33:15.160 --> 02:33:19.160]  Commercial soils if that were the case then I should be able to go over to walmart
[02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:20.760]  or
[02:33:20.760 --> 02:33:22.760]  Costco and get bags of miracle grow
[02:33:24.040 --> 02:33:27.000]  And do a hocus pocus over it, right?
[02:33:27.960 --> 02:33:30.440]  Yeah, no, no one's suggesting to use miracle
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:35.720]  I'll tell you something. I'll tell you something i've done this
[02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:42.760]  I've taken bags of miracle grow and here's how they do the thing on their on their package
[02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:46.280]  Organic and natural. Oh, okay
[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:51.740]  The word natural term has no meaning has no definition
[02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:58.540]  Either regulatory or statutory it doesn't in your food. So it certainly doesn't have any
[02:34:00.060 --> 02:34:02.940]  Thing going on in your uh soil, right?
[02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:08.060]  But that and that statement's accurate. There probably is some shit in there. That's organic
[02:34:09.420 --> 02:34:11.500]  But natural has any meaning so, okay
[02:34:12.060 --> 02:34:15.980]  This stuff looks really good, but I can take that soil mix like uh, say
[02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:18.780]  Even just 15 percent
[02:34:19.740 --> 02:34:21.760]  Legitimate uh vermicompost
[02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:26.860]  Get some rock dust in there and now i'm not talking about glacial sand
[02:34:27.580 --> 02:34:29.580]  from the guy green
[02:34:29.580 --> 02:34:33.500]  I'm talking about the salt the real deal brand the real deal, you know
[02:34:36.060 --> 02:34:39.440]  And uh some help and I can I can outperform
[02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:43.420]  Any
[02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:45.100]  any
[02:34:45.100 --> 02:34:51.020]  Potting soil sold in a grow store any because you gotta remember
[02:34:52.860 --> 02:34:58.300]  I'm within five miles of the biggest mixing plant. Guess where they get their stuff mixed
[02:34:58.620 --> 02:35:02.560]  They buy from the same place. I do I see them in there and concentrates
[02:35:05.020 --> 02:35:08.060]  You're using that your soil, yeah, I know we've got this other
[02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:10.700]  You know, you always got the
[02:35:10.780 --> 02:35:16.300]  You know shuck and drive I don't need to get that ten dollar stuff I can get by with the four dollar stuff, okay
[02:35:18.300 --> 02:35:22.060]  Yeah, that's why I think it's really important we're here showing people the difference, you know, uh
[02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:28.620]  Seeing a miracle grow they're putting organic and natural because they know the people want it, you know, and let's do it the right way
[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:35.100]  You know, so let's put let's put the information out there and teach people, you know, whether it's building or building their own soil
[02:35:35.900 --> 02:35:40.140]  Improving their native soil or hooking up with companies that are trying to do it do it, right?
[02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:43.580]  You know people want it. Let's be here to show it to them
[02:35:44.540 --> 02:35:46.540]  What I would say is this that?
[02:35:50.800 --> 02:35:55.760]  No matter how good a job we do and most of us don't but
[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:02.880]  When we make a potting soil preparation, it's a stab
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:09.280]  You just don't have what you have in the real world
[02:36:10.080 --> 02:36:12.080]  Where you have birds landing pooping
[02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:15.440]  and bring in microbes, you know, you have
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:18.640]  The whole thing, you know the whole ball of wax
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:21.860]  And unfortunately in cannabis from my experience
[02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:25.840]  So I have this list, you know, I got it from joe the
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:28.640]  the soil guy
[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:35.040]  I need this this this and this you know, and now I think it's gonna pop. Well, maybe maybe not
[02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:37.680]  but at the core
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:39.920]  Unless you get your
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:48.000]  Compost or vermicompost, however, you know, whatever you're able to do start with quality
[02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:52.480]  That's it. The rest of it's bullshit. The rest of it's bullshit about
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:54.800]  you know, uh
[02:36:54.800 --> 02:36:56.800]  Do I use?
[02:36:56.880 --> 02:36:58.960]  Yeah, never mind. Yeah, I just
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:05.120]  Yeah, that's one thing I observe over the years in the no-till beds is the worms do their work and you're basically left with pure
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:09.040]  Castings, you know, and that was really eye-opening seeing that kind of thing for the first time
[02:37:09.840 --> 02:37:11.600]  you know and
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:13.440]  Open a bag of worm
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:17.360]  Castings or vermicompost and there's seeds sprouting right out of it. You can grow in that pier
[02:37:18.240 --> 02:37:20.240]  You know
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:26.320]  Guys's opinion to fix that if someone is realizing. Oh, wow, for whatever reason maybe I have compaction. Oh, wow
[02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:28.880]  This has turned into castings
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:32.320]  What's the best way to improve that if you do have a larger?
[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:34.400]  potting
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:36.400]  medium or a
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:41.840]  If it comes to it, you can't if it comes to it, you can do you can cultivate, you know, turn under turn under the soil
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:45.520]  That's not the end of the world if you have to do that, of course, you know, and then cover crops
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:50.480]  Let the roots take care of it molt. That's where the life comes back in you get the worm activity back up
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:53.200]  You get the microbial activity back up and all those roots
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:59.360]  That's what nature does and that's what brings it all up on its own, you know, so whenever I start seeing that
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:01.440]  you know
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:06.720]  Get that mulch layer back up and and cover crops, you know, it's it's the back area to gets it back
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:11.360]  Can't be overstated
[02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:14.100]  Yeah, I would put it right up there with vermicompost
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:18.080]  Yeah, the next one is uh
[02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:23.200]  And albrecht was talking about this 90 years ago
[02:38:24.700 --> 02:38:29.700]  Mineralization, uh, there's a website called remillerize the earth. It's a not-for-profit
[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:32.480]  5013 whatever
[02:38:33.700 --> 02:38:36.180]  And they work with countries around the world
[02:38:37.700 --> 02:38:43.140]  Because this is the real issue it isn't about growing weed the real issue is that we have to have more food and better food
[02:38:43.940 --> 02:38:46.820]  Because our medicine is keeping people alive longer
[02:38:47.860 --> 02:38:49.860]  So that's a two-edged sword
[02:38:50.100 --> 02:38:52.100]  and
[02:38:52.500 --> 02:38:54.820]  Increasing the nutrient density in food
[02:38:55.700 --> 02:39:02.820]  Is of utmost priority and one of the ways that we can do that is with legitimate rock dust
[02:39:03.620 --> 02:39:06.760]  Okay, and rock dust doesn't mean aluminum silica
[02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:09.380]  Compounds like zeolite bentonite
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:12.080]  Azomite those are ceramics
[02:39:13.380 --> 02:39:17.780]  Azomite I don't remember the record. Uh, that's a brand name from some
[02:39:18.900 --> 02:39:20.900]  family deal in utah
[02:39:20.900 --> 02:39:22.340]  Uh
[02:39:22.340 --> 02:39:26.200]  But it actually was first discovered in france like in 1200s
[02:39:26.980 --> 02:39:31.780]  And they use it to make bread ovens still do the beehive ovens in france
[02:39:32.660 --> 02:39:33.700]  well
[02:39:33.700 --> 02:39:37.620]  It may make a great bread oven, but how does that translate into your soil?
[02:39:38.180 --> 02:39:42.660]  Yeah, it's a it's an alumino silicate clay that people really need to know and it's extremely
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:49.140]  Imbalanced you got 80 of it composing of of unavailable silica and aluminum
[02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:54.100]  12 percent and the silicate so that doesn't leave much variety of
[02:39:54.740 --> 02:39:55.940]  plants name
[02:39:55.940 --> 02:39:57.940]  If you talk to dr. Foss
[02:39:58.500 --> 02:40:00.740]  from bioag and chelation
[02:40:01.460 --> 02:40:03.460]  He will explain that
[02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:09.140]  When you're successful with your soil and you're going to have high chelation levels, right?
[02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:11.860]  one of the
[02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:13.220]  Because
[02:40:13.220 --> 02:40:18.820]  not concerned with considerations is that if you pump your soil because it sounded really groovy with zeolite that
[02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:22.500]  The other is that it dives where the difference between them either look them up. I mean
[02:40:26.660 --> 02:40:33.540]  That aluminum breaks free so now you have free floating aluminum in your soil, how could that possibly be good?
[02:40:35.140 --> 02:40:37.940]  You want to avoid that not go down and buy it
[02:40:38.660 --> 02:40:44.180]  Here we just bring it home and you know, and if you're gonna use that crap go buy it from a ceramic supply
[02:40:45.220 --> 02:40:47.220]  a bag of zeolite
[02:40:47.460 --> 02:40:49.860]  Or kitty litter they harvest it right here
[02:40:50.660 --> 02:40:53.700]  Don't laugh. It has nothing to do with christmas. It's a desert
[02:40:53.940 --> 02:41:00.660]  there's a development back in the 50s called christmas valley that never got off the ground because it's looks like
[02:41:01.780 --> 02:41:03.940]  I don't know arizona on a bad day
[02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:09.780]  And they harvest it right off the floor and bag it uh kitty litter that brand
[02:41:10.660 --> 02:41:14.020]  It's one of the bentonite. It's one of the ites. I don't remember which one
[02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:19.780]  Yeah, so I mean don't even buy it from a grocer if you're going to use that crap. Hey go buy it from a
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:21.780]  ceramic
[02:41:21.780 --> 02:41:23.780]  house, you know for potters and
[02:41:24.500 --> 02:41:26.500]  clay clay people
[02:41:27.220 --> 02:41:29.220]  I wouldn't use it
[02:41:29.540 --> 02:41:31.540]  No need to
[02:41:32.100 --> 02:41:39.620]  Yeah, we got volcanoes here I got all the salt I mean the whole state is built on the salt volcanic ash
[02:41:41.380 --> 02:41:46.100]  Yeah, okay, that's what makes for example, we grow some of the finest hops in the world
[02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:49.060]  They're shipped all over the world
[02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:52.900]  There must be a reason why because of the volcanic level
[02:41:53.860 --> 02:41:55.540]  in our soils
[02:41:55.540 --> 02:41:57.540]  And on the other side of the mountains we grow
[02:41:58.420 --> 02:42:03.060]  We grow several world's finest alfalfa why it's all about
[02:42:04.900 --> 02:42:06.740]  The basalt
[02:42:06.740 --> 02:42:08.500]  levels
[02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:12.500]  And I mean we ship it to the queen and bingham literally that's not exactly
[02:42:13.460 --> 02:42:18.260]  They buy it for the royals. That's how good it is wealthy families in china by
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:21.120]  northwest alfalfa
[02:42:21.380 --> 02:42:23.380]  With all the land in china
[02:42:23.380 --> 02:42:25.380]  Is
[02:42:25.380 --> 02:42:27.700]  Available they have not have to but
[02:42:28.900 --> 02:42:30.180]  they buy
[02:42:30.180 --> 02:42:31.380]  the wealthy
[02:42:31.380 --> 02:42:33.060]  upper class
[02:42:33.060 --> 02:42:38.180]  Buys for their uh livestock and horses and what have you by uh, northwest alfalfa
[02:42:39.860 --> 02:42:44.260]  Yep, and then speaking of that and that's the idea of remineralizing the earth
[02:42:44.340 --> 02:42:51.380]  It's the volcanoes over millennia that have made fertile valleys, you know, and we've washed that away with conventional farming
[02:42:51.780 --> 02:42:54.820]  you know whether it's from from runoff from the mountains or or
[02:42:55.380 --> 02:42:56.420]  You know
[02:42:56.420 --> 02:43:02.660]  Explosions and the ash settling down and then how fertile plants grow after that that's been noticed throughout millennia throughout cultures
[02:43:03.060 --> 02:43:05.220]  Is how fertile those valleys are near volcanoes?
[02:43:05.700 --> 02:43:12.820]  So remineralizing the earth is take bringing that minerals back to the agricultural lands and and that's a huge missing link
[02:43:13.140 --> 02:43:15.140]  And in the topsoil we've lost
[02:43:15.540 --> 02:43:19.140]  Organic seminar a few months ago. I made I mentioned it
[02:43:19.140 --> 02:43:21.140]  that uh the entire
[02:43:22.580 --> 02:43:24.580]  Ocean is
[02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:27.940]  For this discussion a layer of assault
[02:43:29.380 --> 02:43:32.580]  Is this guy in the crowd goes? Well, that's what they want you to believe
[02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:35.940]  I said and who would they be?
[02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:38.820]  Well, the jews man, they run everything
[02:43:39.540 --> 02:43:43.380]  Oh, and you're in cannabis. Oh good. This ought to work out. Well
[02:43:44.340 --> 02:43:46.340]  um
[02:43:46.500 --> 02:43:50.900]  In fact there are parts my home is built on a basalt ledge
[02:43:51.860 --> 02:43:58.980]  It wasn't until this is the oldest neighborhood west of the uh, mississippi river the end of the oregon trail that whole
[02:43:59.700 --> 02:44:01.300]  scenario
[02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:02.340]  and
[02:44:02.340 --> 02:44:04.340]  so
[02:44:04.340 --> 02:44:07.240]  Most of the homes in my neighborhood were built before electricity
[02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:14.580]  That's why the wiring is really interesting because there was an add-on like 60 years after
[02:44:15.380 --> 02:44:19.380]  The city was established like the 1920s early 20s, whatever
[02:44:20.740 --> 02:44:25.930]  and um
[02:44:26.410 --> 02:44:28.090]  We have
[02:44:28.090 --> 02:44:29.610]  It wasn't until
[02:44:29.610 --> 02:44:33.850]  The 90s where they had the technology to drill through this basalt
[02:44:34.010 --> 02:44:39.690]  It had the technology but it had to be affordable to put in steel pilings so they could build this home
[02:44:40.170 --> 02:44:42.170]  Because there's no soil
[02:44:42.250 --> 02:44:46.090]  And uh being a good contractor, you know, I brought in really good topsoil
[02:44:46.570 --> 02:44:48.570]  Uh
[02:44:48.730 --> 02:44:53.450]  So I removed that and put in beds raised beds for growing, you know food
[02:44:54.490 --> 02:44:56.490]  hers and stuff so yeah
[02:44:57.530 --> 02:45:01.610]  Hey guys, we're pushing three hours here. Uh, I have other appointments today. I hate to
[02:45:02.250 --> 02:45:05.770]  Yeah, i'm with you dude. I got like my phone's blowing up
[02:45:05.930 --> 02:45:10.250]  I was supposed to be back at the job site in 15 minutes and it's half an hour away. So
[02:45:11.450 --> 02:45:13.450]  But cooch we gotta have you come back on bro
[02:45:14.010 --> 02:45:16.650]  Just chop one all up just just you
[02:45:18.570 --> 02:45:20.570]  That would be fun, yeah, that'd be fun
[02:45:21.050 --> 02:45:27.050]  Yeah, was that was that a nice surprise? It was thank you. Great to see you again, man. It's been too long
[02:45:27.930 --> 02:45:30.920]  Good
[02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:32.920]  jeremy, uh
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:35.080]  I just one last thing
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:37.080]  I gotta talk about barley
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:41.720]  Okay, so jeremy and I worked on a project and uh
[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:47.360]  A product that he developed
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:54.480]  Well, we developed it together. So instead of just being straight barley we included uh, malted, uh hemp seed
[02:45:55.520 --> 02:45:56.800]  and uh
[02:45:56.800 --> 02:45:58.640]  Else how you put it there?
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:03.120]  Anyway, so I came up with the name in the artwork on the package, but it's called gnarly barley
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:08.660]  And what it does it elevates, uh adds about 350 enzymes
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:11.360]  but also 150, uh
[02:46:11.760 --> 02:46:13.760]  fungal colonies
[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:20.480]  But it adds the kind of enzymes that one specifically they're important to agriculture like
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:23.780]  Barley is the only grain that produces
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:27.380]  alpha amylase and beta amylase
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:29.900]  uh
[02:46:29.900 --> 02:46:32.420]  protease protein urease urea
[02:46:33.740 --> 02:46:40.080]  Phosphatase which stoner doesn't get hung up on phosphorus, right? I mean, well, it's just part of the life's, you know culture
[02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:42.960]  But the big one is titanase
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:45.360]  titanase destroys, uh
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:48.080]  insect eggshells
[02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:51.920]  So if they can't hatch they can't cause problems
[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:55.600]  And all that for 80 cents a pound
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:46:59.920]  Buy it from the home brew store
[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:07.600]  It doesn't matter what grain you use you want to use wheat use malted all malt means is that it was sprouted and then that
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:14.160]  Sprouting process was arrested by temperatures between 115 and 118. That's all it means
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:22.160]  When you say malted it just means sprouted and you and in health food stores now malted, excuse me sprouted
[02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:27.120]  Bread is like right up here, right as far as uh, nutrition
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:33.600]  Well, if it's good for the body, I promise you 99 times out of 100. It's good for your soil
[02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:36.800]  and uh
[02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:40.160]  Yeah, you can use legumes i've even done papaya seeds
[02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:43.280]  You know dry them out and then sprout them
[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:47.120]  I've done every you know, bob's redmill. You might have heard of that company
[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:52.480]  Well, they have a retail store here where everything's in bulk. So I go in there and get like a half a cup
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:56.240]  And one bag of this and I go up to the counter, you know, I have
[02:47:57.040 --> 02:48:00.720]  25 30 different stuff and they just look at me like what are you doing?
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:04.880]  but anyway, so I just I tested everything and uh
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:10.480]  Yeah, I get into malted grains and really good for your worm bins it'll really accelerate uh
[02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:16.240]  deconstruction of the om so it means the bacteria can do their job which means
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:24.160]  Worms have more food like any organism you give an organism more food. They increase their populations, right?
[02:48:25.120 --> 02:48:32.320]  So for a commercial worm people growing for fishing it's good for that. It's good for your soil. Yeah, it's good for you
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:35.120]  You don't put it in a smoothie it might not
[02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:37.920]  be as good as you know, honey or something, but
[02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:44.960]  Anyway, you get the idea. So, uh, and I you know, go buy your grains from a homebrew store. You don't have to pay
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:49.520]  the uh, jeremy and jim, uh tax, you know and uh
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:56.880]  A cool package, but yeah, just start using and check it out malted barley what it does for the human body
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.160]  and then most of that stuff you can uh
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:04.800]  Not copy but you know take that science and apply it to living soil
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:14.160]  If and because just one last thing if you go and look at the diet or excuse me the molecular formula and the molecular
[02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:16.080]  structure
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:20.880]  Of chlorophyll chlorophyll too. That's when it dominates this planet's uh
[02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:24.320]  botany world
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:27.040]  There's one magnesium
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:34.720]  Magnesium, uh, adam one one four nitrogen and like 50 carbon
[02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:37.820]  75 oxygen
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:47.440]  And then probably equal number so i've always been puzzled. What what is a magnesium hungry plant since uh chlorophyll only uses one
[02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:49.600]  ion
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:51.680]  Now if you go and you look at human blood
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:56.080]  The big difference is that instead of magnesium we have iron
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:04.020]  And we have four nitrogen and about the same number of carbon hydrogen and oxygen but what's even more remarkable
[02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:10.340]  Is how it's science fiction close how close they are and exactly?
[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:14.080]  This oxygen ion here over on this branch
[02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:16.320]  See what I mean?
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:20.800]  There's websites that have the drawings for you. You'll be blown away
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:23.280]  I mean
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:25.280]  It's fascinating
[02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:31.060]  The similarities within nature and us and how we fit into it all and how we feed our plants and how we feed ourselves
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:36.400]  You know, that's really that's that's something that people really should connect and what connected for me in gardening
[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:42.800]  Is that how how all related it is and and how we treat the planet how we garden and how that affects our health?
[02:50:43.420 --> 02:50:44.880]  fascinating
[02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:47.280]  one last thing I would offer is this that uh,
[02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:50.240]  this method of agriculture that we've
[02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:52.000]  Uh
[02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.240]  Taken at the end of world war ii
[02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:56.960]  so we're less than
[02:50:57.120 --> 02:50:59.120]  About three quarters of a century more or less
[02:51:00.640 --> 02:51:03.540]  And yet and so we're in a disaster
[02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:10.800]  Uh, we lost the entire deal in florida there is no more orange juice industry
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.560]  There's parts of the united states in the big production
[02:51:14.800 --> 02:51:20.400]  Uh districts or regions like grain in the midwest where there's no top soil left
[02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:25.600]  And then you go and you look at asia and they have rice fields that go back 6 000 years
[02:51:27.200 --> 02:51:29.360]  Somebody's got this wrong. Okay
[02:51:30.640 --> 02:51:35.040]  Somebody's got this really really wrong and I don't think it's asia
[02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:37.760]  No, it's about money
[02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:41.760]  So let's help show the difference
[02:51:44.720 --> 02:51:46.960]  Really appreciated your time brother. Yeah
[02:51:48.720 --> 02:51:50.080]  Thank you for having me
[02:51:50.080 --> 02:51:55.680]  Yeah, we really really appreciate it man. I you know, i'd love to in time have you come back on the show man and
[02:51:56.240 --> 02:51:59.360]  Discuss a lot of things for yeah, we'd love to you know
[02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:03.780]  Um hit my website for products that you guys anyone might be interested in mountainorganics.net
[02:52:04.880 --> 02:52:07.120]  All the instagrams if you're here listening, you already know
[02:52:08.480 --> 02:52:13.040]  Thank you. Ian so much and thank you coots for showing up today. Really appreciate it my friend
[02:52:13.680 --> 02:52:15.680]  You're welcome so much appreciate it
[02:52:16.400 --> 02:52:18.240]  Thanks guys
[02:52:18.240 --> 02:52:20.580]  And uh, just some quick housekeeping
[02:52:22.080 --> 02:52:25.520]  Our motley crew's making a road trip next week, right?
[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:28.320]  That's right. So, uh
[02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:36.480]  So basically tomorrow i'm gonna go to weed con which is uh here in la and then next week the equally clever name canna con
[02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:39.200]  is in oklahoma city and
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.480]  these two cats are carrying the uh
[02:52:43.600 --> 02:52:46.320]  that big burly table, uh
[02:52:47.920 --> 02:52:56.320]  That big cumbersome dab bar to uh, okc where we'll be setting up and broadcasting live
[02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:00.880]  For two straight days
[02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:07.920]  And we'll have a whole bunch of people jumping on we got lance lambert there michael from uh, royal gold
[02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:10.240]  we got brandon rust will be uh,
[02:53:10.960 --> 02:53:16.720]  I believe there and so a whole uh crew of people to help brian and daguerre, uh
[02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:19.360]  Create some good conversations
[02:53:19.360 --> 02:53:22.000]  And i'm gonna give a quick shout out to james from red dirt race
[02:53:22.320 --> 02:53:26.720]  He's been our host while we're out there. So we really appreciate that a lot to learn and he's uh
[02:53:27.120 --> 02:53:31.920]  He himself has changed his garden and he wants to move to a living soil system because of the show
[02:53:32.320 --> 02:53:34.320]  So shout out to everybody that's you know
[02:53:34.560 --> 02:53:40.720]  As we progress learning from coots learning from ian learning from our show and then hopefully in time you guys are going out and
[02:53:40.960 --> 02:53:44.400]  Teaching as well. That's really what this show is about on thursdays
[02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:46.480]  We all do this out of the kindness of our heart
[02:53:46.800 --> 02:53:50.640]  And this is something that I feel like it's starting to really resonate with our community
[02:53:50.640 --> 02:53:56.080]  So we appreciate each and every one of you. Thank you for hitting that like button and everything else that involves youtube
[02:53:56.560 --> 02:54:00.420]  We just appreciate you guys spreading the love and letting people know that we are here educating
[02:54:00.980 --> 02:54:06.500]  Uh without all fluff without all the bullshit in between for sure appreciate it all so much
[02:54:07.540 --> 02:54:11.300]  Just do uh, do me a favor peter when you guys go on these shows
[02:54:12.260 --> 02:54:14.260]  Tell them that you got a real
[02:54:14.500 --> 02:54:15.700]  uh
[02:54:15.700 --> 02:54:20.660]  Hardcore smartass that just laughs his ass off every time these events have the word con
[02:54:21.300 --> 02:54:22.660]  at the end
[02:54:22.660 --> 02:54:24.100]  kind of con
[02:54:24.100 --> 02:54:25.460]  uh
[02:54:25.460 --> 02:54:30.900]  You know, uh, I I find it not only ironic but certainly uh fascinating it
[02:54:32.100 --> 02:54:34.100]  Yeah, uh
[02:54:34.740 --> 02:54:36.340]  We
[02:54:36.340 --> 02:54:42.260]  I don't I don't disagree at all. You're preaching to the choir. Uh, I I want I want to start getting uh
[02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:48.580]  the fcp events back up and running and uh, they're going to be smaller more intimate less about uh,
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:53.060]  extracting every dollar from exhibitors and attendees and uh,
[02:54:53.860 --> 02:54:58.820]  You know just kind of creating opportunities for these types of conversations, uh
[02:54:59.860 --> 02:55:06.740]  We're we're gonna have the fcp invitational which will be uh, smoke weed and play golf. Uh, that's uh
[02:55:08.260 --> 02:55:09.380]  What's that
[02:55:09.380 --> 02:55:15.780]  Frisbee golf or real golf real golf as good or bad as you are. It doesn't really matter. No, I know I
[02:55:16.580 --> 02:55:18.580]  as a young man
[02:55:18.820 --> 02:55:22.900]  Frisbee golf took off and uh, there was in fact in huntington beach where I lived
[02:55:24.260 --> 02:55:26.260]  They had two frisbee golf courses
[02:55:27.300 --> 02:55:32.980]  So I thought that was pretty neat and you know, just like golf you didn't have just one frisbee. You had to have a
[02:55:33.780 --> 02:55:36.980]  uh a quiver, you know different sizes and weights and
[02:55:37.700 --> 02:55:42.100]  It was as nutty as any other hobby, you know, like whatever well, they're they're not
[02:55:42.980 --> 02:55:48.500]  They're not mutually exclusive. We could do both. So yeah, that's uh, but but i'm thinking i'm just sitting here
[02:55:48.500 --> 02:55:53.220]  Going like with all these events popping back up. It reminds me that I want to take one step back and
[02:55:53.940 --> 02:55:57.060]  you know events take a little more time to plan than uh,
[02:55:58.020 --> 02:56:03.300]  just like conversations like this, but uh, they're definitely fun and I miss them and
[02:56:04.580 --> 02:56:06.660]  it'd be cool to hang out with people again and
[02:56:07.460 --> 02:56:14.020]  With two daughters and another on the way. I'm i'm i'm tethered mostly to the socal area. So i'm kind of like
[02:56:14.740 --> 02:56:16.740]  Need to do shit around here
[02:56:18.740 --> 02:56:23.220]  Well, what do you have in southern california what's that demographic 25 30 million people
[02:56:24.180 --> 02:56:31.620]  Uh, yeah, no, it's it's I I have no complaints about having events here. Oh, no, I just was saying there was a gentleman
[02:56:33.380 --> 02:56:34.260]  Uh
[02:56:34.260 --> 02:56:35.940]  And he's a word loosely
[02:56:35.940 --> 02:56:39.940]  Uh was telling me that he was such a big grower and you know in southern california
[02:56:39.940 --> 02:56:44.260]  I said, how could you not be there's enough people you can grow anything and sell it
[02:56:44.580 --> 02:56:47.220]  So telling me how much you sold doesn't mean shit
[02:56:48.020 --> 02:56:51.300]  Right, uh and don't get me into these cups
[02:56:52.260 --> 02:56:54.260]  so, uh
[02:56:56.180 --> 02:56:58.180]  Sticky cup sticky
[02:56:59.140 --> 02:57:05.300]  Yeah, the the one I was bouncing around right before uh, covid hit was a uh,
[02:57:06.500 --> 02:57:08.500]  my friend, uh, chris
[02:57:09.140 --> 02:57:10.900]  belongs to a
