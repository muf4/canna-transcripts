hi guys how's it going we're here for ask the cannabis nerd and we're starting a
little bit early but no big deal so we'll get the roll going
yeah a really good show just ended the Brian and Marco Wednesday show if you
guys didn't catch it let's back up on future cannabis project so go give that
a watch lots of good topics good to see Brian back in a healthy studio seat so
cheers to him glad he's on the mend I had to do go run around and do some
grocery shop do some shopping today so I wasn't able to drop in the on the
price on the show but like yeah you look really south last week is he doing
better yeah I mean it appears he looked better I don't know any details or
anything but he showed up he wasn't in the hospital so that I mean I guess I'll
take that as a positive I missed the first few minutes so I don't know if he
kind of gave everyone an update or what went on and I'm really wishing that I
hadn't started this room it's all good man now you're in the corner you have to
be in the driver's seat today I will know not to do that again yeah I've done
like it happens all the time yeah no big deal dr. enemies how are you doing
now what are you up to what are you up to this beautiful day was great show
last night it's always great to have you around I feel a little like I'm much
better than I was but say two weeks ago I still I feel like a little out of
sorts because I didn't use my brain or think about cannabis really for like two
weeks and like on the way from the hops like on the way home from the hospital I
had literally no idea where I was well I felt like you know like when you arrive
in it like a different country and you're in a taxi like from the airport
to somewhere where you don't know where you're going I felt like that it was
just really weird I'm now starting to like get back into the swing of things
get back into work starting to think about cannabis again but like last night
on my show I was like holy shit I haven't talked about cannabis or thought
about cannabis for such a long time like I feel like I have no idea what I'm
talking about it was like like what three weeks I was out so yeah I'm
excited to get back into it oh shit man like what I know yeah I'm super pumped
to have you back I mean you had a rough little period there I'm glad like you
sound super healthy and get back to it but you're also like you moved recently
so dropping in a different part of the world like that and like and then going
through an experience like that and then on the way home like I could totally see
that like oh it's so weird I feel like so out of place that almost serendipitous
feeling that you get oh my god it was so weird yeah I've lived in Colorado since
1987 and just moved here in New Jersey in April and when Brett picked me up
from the hospital like we it was dark and we drove on the interstate home and
I don't know for those of you who have been to the East Coast at least in like
New England area there's just trees that line the whole interstate and so
like there's no like landmarks or buildings you cannot tell where you are
and I was just like looking out the window going I have no idea where we're
going it was just really really really strange and Jersey Jersey is not New
England just I want to make being being being from Maine Jersey is not New
England and and I'm and I'm sorry that you had to move to New Jersey I really
actually in the part of New Jersey that I'm in and I see like literally that's
how much I don't know about where I freaking live right now actually the part
of New Jersey I was warned before I came in people are like like New Jersey it
doesn't not have a very good name in the United States or anywhere really in the
world but honestly where I live in New Jersey it's beautiful on one side of my
house I have the ocean on the other side of my house I have the forest I have
seen more wildlife here than I ever saw in Colorado like in my six months here
the diversity of this plant fungus animal species is incredible must be in
Dome City I am in covered covered by the dome yeah that's covered by a huge dome
apparently I'm in some kind of weather bubble where we don't get like it's
snowed but today it rains and so it's washed out it's I was not expecting this
and I don't think this is the part of New Jersey that people talk about no
it's not I think I think a lot of people shit on New Jersey pretty regularly so I
think it's like the worldwide shitting post it's like because everybody in New
York shits on New Jersey and everybody in apparently New England shits on New
Jersey but anyways well people from New Jersey don't people from New Jersey I
hope somebody likes New Jersey otherwise I don't know why the fuck but
anyways we'll get the show rolling welcome in Johnny and Matt and Hanson
welcome to cannabis after ask the cannabis nerd horticulture show where we
talk about everything we can when it comes to cannabis and production
cannabis but also like post-production a little bit cooking and you can ask
anything you want whether or not we're gonna have an answer that's you know
normal we don't always have a guarantee for that but we will have an answer of
some sort or at least be able to point you in the right direction so we have a
lot of amazing people on this stage dr. I was your Bob and and everyone else
Anthony Matt Johnny and so if you have any questions don't be afraid to raise
your hand and come on up Robert I see you there come on up you'll be our first
guest of the day if you have a question or a comment or a statement like this if
you have a question or a comment or something to get us started I'd be
happy to get it rolling let's just have a quick hello hello my name is London I
am helping produce here a future cannabis project a couple shows I have a
class on Garden Academy and we do a little thing so my name is London nice
to meet you all I'm here to help and be part of the community well we just go
around introduce self cheddar Bob you start because you're at the top left and
then we'll skip me go to Anna Johnny Matt Anthony Evan and and then Robert
we'll end on you and you can ask your question for the day if you don't mind
just wait for everybody say hello all right hello I'm cheddar Bob I'm a
homegrower for 20 years and yeah I am NOT a scientist but I have made lots of
mistakes and learned from them so I guess I'm here just to kind of make
people at ease and let you know that you don't have to be a scientist or or such
to be able to grow this plant so that's me I said that and then I was like shit
she's next no honestly I I know a lot of I've read a lot of stuff I have a lot
of access to a lot of literature and research I know what the research says I
know what I have a lot of access to a lot of people who grow the plant hands
on the plant and I can honestly say that you can read every book you can read
every paper but when it comes to growing the plant all that pretty much goes out
the window I have the utmost respect for growers breeders people who are in
this industry like I said I am a scientist I would like to bring science
to the industry and to some of the things that some of the growers and
legacy breeders and things like that have said and do why they say and why
they do the things they do because that's not there yet I do have a PhD in
genetics my PhD focused on cannabis of course and I just learned something new
every day I love this industry I love the plant most interesting plant I think
on the planet and I'm super excited to be here hey everybody I'm Johnny I'm a
commercial cultivator and cannabis enthusiast also have a home grow I
definitely agree with dr. Anubis I think that cannabis is the most interesting
plant that we have available to us as humans and that's saying a lot because
there's a lot of interesting plants out there and it's an honor to be up here
with everybody there's a lot of great minds up here a lot of experience and
yeah happy to be here with all you hmm hey I'm Matt I guess I could say
commercial grow I've kind of worked everywhere retail commercial home grow
medical for some time I've been around cannabis since I was young and lots of
plants yeah I just like growing things and I like when plants do things it's
kind of cool like two people like even food you know it's cool what food does
to us yeah I'm kind of like a citizen scientist I guess there you go and I
know dr. Anubis doesn't like that term but yeah Anthony's yours
you button you button I think I think Anthony's on mute we're coming back to
you am I not hearing am I the only one not here oh it's all right Anthony we'll
get back to you hello Evian how are you welcome welcome welcome it's great to
see you and how was your I well we have been spoken yet how was your Christmas
season and want to introduce yourself and then we'll get started with questions
there's go mo on the chat in faith in future cannabis projects like I hear
dead people apparently heading okay Ashley will probably drop it a little
bit later but I get we all Anthony dropped out there oh hey guys sorry about
that I guess actually just got booted off of what was going on I kept getting
the servers are struggling message and full bars and Wi-Fi so I don't know what
happened there but hi nice to be here nice to hear all your voices and yeah I
had a great holiday season I just got to take a much-needed vacation and I am a
permaculture certified I guess yeah same thing I've been working in the regulated
market and Oregon for the past six years but have been touching plants for 18
years and I have a pretty big fascination with scale and I love data
driven science and you know I just lifelong learner and I'm a teacher at
Oakster dam and I taught gardening to children in the past and taught
permaculture to people so I just really I love all plants not just cannabis and
I'm just yeah I'm a huge fan and I just want to say on the topic of citizen
science is the fun topic so I'd love to hear I believe it was Matt or Johnny was
bringing that up and if dr. and it's doesn't like that that's actually what
they told me when I was teaching in the public school system I had to I had to
use that term when I was teaching gardening to children that's what they
wanted us to use and so a lot of the projects and things were based on like
encouraging the students to be citizen scientists so I believe that could be
something we discuss at some point but I personally like that because that's what
it was way to like get people to participate I think was how I felt about
it so I'm a big fan of science and like also this more spiritual side so it all
ties together I guess nice to see you guys
I am back man I was having issues with my microphone for some reason I couldn't
come off of mute so I just switch sources here I said well did you want to
have it say a quick hello and introduce yourself to everybody sure man my name
is Anthony I'm the owner of Boneyard seeds NorCal I've been growing cannabis
for 40 years I probably had some kind of experience with it either failing at it
or trying not to so that's kind of why I'm here I love the humble failures I
think it's like I think the people that are that know the most failed the most
as well they've experienced failure the both times and I think that's a really
important part of I also think it's all about the journey it's never really
sometimes about this I mean when you get a good crop it's definitely about the
destination but like I love the process the process is where I enjoy so we do
have a couple people up on stage to join us would you like to start us off with
our first question or comment there Robert sure all right my name is Robert
from New York and I've been growing in a trap house for 45 years and then decided
to come out the upstate New York and do a hemp project and I grew some plants
the last few years a couple of thousand and now I'm out of that I don't want to
grow anymore but I do have a question about soil that I'd like to direct to
Johnny yeah go for it yeah I want to start testing my soil and I have a lot
of like yards like five yards of roots organic that I paid a lot of money for
and I want to change it over so at first first thing I want to do is start
testing all the soil that I have because I want I'm gonna do probably 12 plants
legally and I want it to be real big so they got to be really successful and
what I'm you know I'm what my question is is how should I do you know how should
I turn this soil almost into money turning to KNF actually I don't know if
it's the right question to ask up here but I'll direct it to Johnny well I mean
the soil you're gonna be getting like the potting soil that you're gonna be
buying bulk amounts of it's gonna have some nutrition in it some castings maybe
some guano or chicken manure but it's not gonna really those nutrients are
gonna stick around for too long you're gonna have a couple weeks where you're
not gonna have to worry about adding anything then after that you're gonna be
you know looking at having to add something for for fertility as far as
testing the soil if it's fresh soil I don't really I mean it is I guess
but at the same time it's gonna be it's old it's old it's old I'm not gonna
waste it it has a lot of P light in it I'm sure you know it was organic look
like right yes yes yes I use it for years usually add worm castings but you
know now that I'm into this other way of thinking to the the KNF you know I
am I'm not gonna go out I'm not buying nutrients ever again in my life I am
gonna do everything that I'm gonna do right here on this farm I have a hundred
acres with swamp and everything beautiful to pick out all my microbes
from and develop it the thing is what should I be looking I'm what I'm gonna
do is send out some samples as well to say to you I'm gonna send out some
samples I have a lot of clay and rock of course that's what's up here in upstate
New York and then you know I have a lot of roots organic that I'm gonna probably
you know I have to do some IMOs on it and you know turn it can I can I do that
can I change that soil yes yes and no you know potting soil it's it's
technically it's not even soil it's a soil as medium that you're getting but
made out of peat perlite and some compost or castings usually with you
know slight so for your with KNF it really you benefit from having a natural
soil system so planting in the native soil that you're working with that way
you have the different horizons you can do a little bit you have a little bit
more nutrient cycling capabilities and it just it has a different texture that
allows itself to it lends itself to those practices not saying you can't use
KNF practices and natural farming practices and potting soil it just
becomes more of a challenge than if you're working in that native soil
structure as far as testing I would recommend you know I use Logan lab
sometimes and there's a few other ones but try to find something that's that's
local near you and then once you get the test Cornell Cornell perfect and then
yeah you can probably get a recommendation from an agronomist from
Cornell or one of their extension agencies and they'll be able to point
you in the right direction of what you're gonna need to have that soil be
balanced for your purposes. Thanks because all I have is because I planted I have a
greenhouse so I did like 150 200 plants in five six seven gallon pots so I have
all the soil I mean it's thousands of dollars worth of soil and the soil that's
out in the land is you're gonna do just vegetables outside and fix that but
it's clay and rock up here. So I was just going to ask someone quite
clarifying questions. Robert could we just have a couple so just let me get
this clear so you have some you have a really cool property of state New York
you have a bunch of soil from roots organic that have been sitting for a
while in the bag and then are you looking to use that roots organic soil
directly in the greenhouse or are you looking to remediate the soil that you
have outside or kind of like build the soil that you have like that I guess
that's my question is like are you looking to test the old roots organic
bag soil or are you looking to test your you know just your soil on your property?
That was yes and I'm gonna test the soil in the property but I know what it's
like it's you know it's not great it's just really clay it's hard it's rocky
you can't believe it. You probably don't want to add organic matter once you have.
I want to create that organic matter that's the whole thing with KNF you can.
Well you can build compost also so if you're going if you don't want to import
sometimes you know like I'm obviously like a big fan of closed-loop systems if
you're going to you know if you want to build the soil sometimes initially it's
good you may need to bring in outside things with organic matter if you can
partner with somebody that you know locally who has like clean compost
source or animal manure that is clean and tests well also.
Robert, Robert, Robert, brother, brother, brother, brother, you're coming up here to ask a question the
moderators are answering it let them finish what they're saying and then come
in your microphone is just like it's instant sound bash to both the
future both the other person when you come in and someone else is talking it
like you can't hear anything on both the YouTube side and that so just please
allow them to finish talking close their mic off before you respond back just
because it's killing my ears here brother. Thanks London, it's strange
with the way feedback works on Clubhouse sometimes so what I would do normally
like if I'm consulting on a project the very first thing I do is like there's
that observation piece where you're looking and if you know you have clay
soil and you have a lot of rock and that you have to build it I still do soil
tests because then I want to see if there's some sort of remineralization
process and I think it's awesome that you want to use KNF sometimes I do find
that you also need to utilize other techniques especially if there needs to
be some sort of remineralization and that will come through in your soil
tests and I do find that you have to a lot of the time it really like what
Johnny was saying to work with an agronomist is really a great tool also
because you can really get down to the nitty-gritty and see like okay yes this
is what I want to do because the indigenous microorganisms are fantastic
and obviously you want you that's what your goal you want to do that beautiful
that's like so cool I really honor that and if you have on your land if you
have animals that you're working with I used to have goats and rabbits and I
absolutely felt like when I was utilizing the that in my gardens it was
just like the most night and day difference it's really incredible but
you can build soil it does take time and you can remediate heavy clay soils
it's just really that organic matter and other things and there's a ton of
fantastic techniques in order to do that I know I know more traditionally like
biodynamics and organics and other different styles I'm familiar with you
know how you kind of work with indigenous microorganisms but as far as
building soil I'm not really certain the exact method they use within KNF to
build soil if it's the same kind of practices but I would say for those are
really important steps and then I would be curious to like if your goal is to
you have all of this roots organic soil also I mean it is great because you
already have this that is essentially if you're just gonna kind of consider it
it's organic matter essentially like what Johnny was saying it might not
actually be soil per se but it's you know you got a lot of organic matter in
there even if you have a lot of perlite and other things it's just gonna help to
kind of build what you're working on but yeah I would really that would be if it
was me and I would be working with the property those would be the tactics that
I would take and I would definitely be looking to bring in like large quantities
of compost or animal manure or something along those lines and Robert if I could
add to that really quick as far as adding organic matter the fastest
approach that you could take would be importing some but you could also start
planting maize and chopping and dropping that and you can get multiple you know
successions of that throughout a season and build topsoil via growing corn
chopping it once it's a couple feet tall and then letting it grow and growing
more and repeating that process as well as starting to inoculate with JADAM
microbial solution so I don't know if you're familiar with that but that is a
very very powerful tool for breaking up clay soils and improving soil texture it
has some some diluted seawater in it so it's excellent for flocculation and it
really can can make dramatic differences in the matter of a few months so that's
something that I would highly recommend that you start implementing as soon as
you're able to. I want to add one more thing also just really quick Robert this
is a good this is a really good question also I will say because this is a super
common issue that happens across the board and when you do land assessments
this is very much one of the things people suffer from I just worked on a
property this year that had the very similar issue and that was the first
thing we're like okay can we afford to import large amounts of organic matter
because along with remineralization and there's some other balancing techniques
but something that I've had really good success with in the past especially with
breaking up that really heavy clay soil is utilizing there's different types of
cover crops essentially and different things that you can also do to like do a
kind of chop and drop over and over again but I have had good luck with doing
daikon radishes they really add a lot into the soil you just have to be
careful that you actually till them back in before they recede or otherwise you
can just be creating kind of like a daikon radish issue on your property but
you just have to get things before unless you want them to recede which and
the comfrey is another good one that just really builds a lot of kind of like
instant chop and drop mulch. Yeah you bring up that radish method that's
something that my partner Nick Rysden uses at his farm in Michigan what he's
done to revitalize the soil there is create hugelkultur beds all around the
place and then plant radishes on top of those beds and then just allows nature
to return all that back into the soil over each season before he plants his
cannabis garden in there and that cats growing some of the best cannabis out
there so what I was gonna ask is if you had a large enough space in your
greenhouse or if that's where you were actually growing it or you're just going
straight out into the native areas build hugelkultur bed and grow your cannabis
in a spot that's south-facing that gets the best light out there and then use
the rest of your time after during this season to start to revitalize other
sections with the same technique it will build up a living soul quite quickly and
you can add all your native foliage and back into that system the worm castings
and the manures that you said you had access to and just let nature do its
thing and within a year you'll be able to grow on there and you'll see the
difference very easily. And leaf mold that's something I did on a much smaller scale but
I have a similar situation on our property very shallow clay hard soil and
so I had to build hugelkultur and that worked extremely well you could just
tell the roots got a lot of penetration into the hugelkultur and adding leaf
mold onto that is super easy and just letting that break down. Yep when in
doubt build up if you can't go in and out. Also just be careful when you're using leaf mold that you
don't layer it too thickly because it's one of those things that needs to be used.
I think there's such a great knowledge here within this panel
because those are all such great things and hugelkultur I think you know
it's definitely like an old-school practice but it's also very
revolutionary because if you have a hundred acres like that you always are
going to be ending up with brush and you don't always want to be burning it and
so building hugelkultur kind of berms and beds is just such an
amazing amazing way to use that. I mean we've done projects with like
massive hugelkultur with like heavy machinery and different things so it
kind of just depends on what you're doing if you want smaller scale or
bigger scale but there's a ton of opportunity there if that's a great
suggestion Anthony. I just want to first apologize to London I'm sorry I get
excited sometimes when they jump on but thank you you guys really helped me out
a lot and I'm starting to understand what I have to do to this farm and I'm
only gonna do greenhouse is gonna be just for my cannabis plants and then
outside will be vegetables and I am growing I have a cop a cover cop growing
of Bernice what is it clover and daikon radishes but I didn't chop them in yet I
guess might be too late I have to do it by the end of the year but thank you
very much. Robert I'm not sure if you're a big reader or or not like like book
wise some people are some people aren't I'm not sure if you're like a like a big
like book reader or not but there's one book that I could recommend that might
help you on your journey it's by it's by David Montgomery the hidden half of
nature and it he's a geomorphologist if I'm right and him and his wife moved to
Seattle and bought like a piece of land that was all kind of solid packed rock
and he kind of tells his story how they turned it from rock into a luscious like
garden and it's a pretty unique kind of a journey and I think kind of maybe like similar
to where you might be at a piece of land with no like organic matter it's all
tight packed and you know you're trying to make something out of it well there
is a doctor there sorry Ashley popped up on the top here is a little bit of a
master gardening society of Oakland country you could call culture gardening
a good bit of info there for you as well Robert to dig into and and they I
appreciate it it's just sometimes these things get a little bit finicky I
appreciate your your patience and taking the time and then joining us on stage to
ask the question because we appreciate and if there's anybody else there that
has questions or wants to come up there next we do have a list there with a few
that came in in chat but if you're in the room and want to ask it first you
have a follow-up question or a comment that you would like to finish off there
with Robert we talking to me yeah yeah do we answer everything to your little
yeah yeah I'm glad because you know when you grow indoors you think you're a
grower you think you know about growing because I grew good plants but you know
I didn't know anything I followed a formula and I got good at it but thank
you there's also you can look into Paul Stamets method of inoculating wood chips
in an anaerobic state and then leaving them out in the open once they've
inoculated that stuff cannot jumpstart your soil very easily if you have access
to a bunch of wood chips it's something that you can do on a large scale very
easy I do thank you and I have goat manure and everything I've even got some
15 year old horse manure nice do watch out with horse manure because my
understanding is if if there is a spray that they will put on plants that will
kill weeds and one of the issues with those particularly like leaf weeds and
and the horse will eat that hay and then poop and then they'll have this this
specific I think it's a herbicide and it's actually really bad for cannabis so
you got to make sure you know what's being fed to the plants at the time too
is really important I do see you put your hand up there where'd you go brother
welcome to club also Eric rest of it I see Eric Brown Center and say Connor if
you guys want to come up and join the panel you're welcome to just go ahead
and raise your hand I do have a question here from in chat one of the big
questions that I think was asked here and I think it's an interesting one to
jump into is fungus gnats now fungus gnats are an interesting little pest in
the fact that they're so common and depending on the system that you that
you're using they could be a good or a bad they could be a sign of a good bit
of fungus and growth but they could also be a bad thing on your growth setup so
I'll throw this one over to actually cheddar Bob because I bet you've run
into this in your growing before do you have a general outlook on fungus gnats
what's your thought there um so as far as I'm concerned and you know I have
always thought you know fungus gnats come with a with an organic living soil
setup I've always been used to them and they're more for me as a small home
grower they're more of a just a nuisance rather than an actual pest you know I'll
always have a couple flying around but never never an infestation and I I
attribute that to my watering practices you know I don't let things get overly
wet so I don't I don't have that moisture growth of the larvae and stuff
but yeah I mean everything in balance right I mean the the fungus gnats are
food for the other living things in your in your soil beds so the the circle of
life continues as long as you can keep things in balance I think you're gonna
be okay and honestly I never thought that they would affect the roots and
such and the first time I ever saw that they would was actually with I think it
was Capulet or posted something where his roots were like destroyed by fungus
gnats and it's the first time I'd ever seen it in 20 years so you know you
should be aware but if you have a few of them I don't I personally don't think
it's a an issue it's you know when they get out of balance that's when bad
things happen and it's probably more than just fungus gnats going on at that
point so yeah I'm gonna second that cheddar Bob the watering practices it's
so big if you're just letting that top layer and those top couple inches of
soil dry out a little bit before waterings you're gonna avoid them
largely and then if they're still around it they're not going to be much
more than a nuisance putting up some yellow sticky traps to get the the
adults that are flying around and maybe using a beneficial predatory nematodes
is a great solution that all don't keep them in check and you're correct cheddar
Bob it was Capulet er and that was the first time I've ever seen that as well
it's pretty wild the watering is huge but like I I don't think it's like I
think it is if it the system doesn't have an earth consent rate like I'm like
cute I'm promise if you like talking me a lot I'm always like promise fun stuff
if you don't have pumice because perlite and and like any other one right now but
essentially both of them don't have anything to them and nitrogen-fixing
bacteria quickly start to break them down that's why they start to turn green
and get me like algae and fungus gnats need that little like bacteria that
grows for the optimal life so it's like a superfood to them and when I look at
living soil systems I commonly see fungus gnats with people who maybe
didn't source or couldn't source
like pumice that's like a really common like trend that I'm noticing between the
gardens or rice halls or yeah well I didn't really want to bring it up
because there's a whole group of people that swear by rice holes but I yeah
that's a huge one or or get this hey hey hey is like fucking fuck yeah like so
many fungus that's in it but the thing is is is it depends on how you look at
things right there's a little bit of an aspect on life and and I think in
general that you that you can take and there there are our two main kind of
schools of thought in my mind when it comes to this type of a subject a the
hypo clean fucking might as well grow in hydroponic salt concept or the other
end where this I mean definitely they cause damage but the thing is the fact
is that they eat fungus and bacteria so having fungus next is a sign that you
have high amounts of fungus and bacteria so it's not necessarily a bad thing by
adding ensuring you have something like hypoalysis my my list or rover beetles
are fucking awesome are two amazing additions that you can add into your
soil welcome up there Eric that you can add into your system that actually do
fairly well so I've been I and Robert I guess I could have mentioned this a
little bit earlier I popped you down there but I I started with my concept of
horticulture that I'm playing with right now is to start with a completely inert
medium and end with living soil or as much life in the soil as possible so I'm
actually on my third run and I'm down to like 10% of the original nutrient
content that was necessary so it's kind of like this this move forward the great
thing about rover beetles is is there they'll move they'll move from one spot
to another so even though I'm in three gallon pots and not in a large bed I see
these rover beetles the second I introduce new pots into that environment
move over to that space and start to propagate and move in there so this is
not a good thing these these fungus gnats are just providing food for my
hypo and my my rover beetles and in general they're showing signs of
bacteria there now there is an extreme degree and they can get fucking
irritating and a bit nasty in a lot of situations an extremely high amount of
them is a sign that something's definitely off do you have Evian do you
have any solutions if you have an overly high amount because usually there's a
sign of something that was going wrong but what would you do in this situation
or where would you check first to see where there might be this imbalance
that's taking place so I have I like to call them my nemeth they're one of my
nemesis pests, them and thrips, I mean there's a whole bunch of them but like I have an
interesting relationship with fungus gnats where I I they can't they can't
exist in any in any equation in when you get into like you know when you're
at a commercial scale I definitely see them as an issue I do a few different
things first of all checking your population is super important so I use
yellow sticky traps to monitor populations and change them regularly
and date them so you're seeing how you know how extensive the problem is
becoming and then also if you take just a small scoop of whatever whether you're
using cocoa or living soil or whatever you're using take a small scoop of that
and just inspecting it with your you know you take a little scoop and you put
it in your hand you can kind of see how much larva is existing and if you're
seeing really high populations of larva then you're having a serious problem
because they do eat the roots of the plants and they do spread disease that
way as well so that's where another reason why you know fungus gnats can be
concerning is because you can start to see when you start seeing damage on on
your roots then you know you that you're in a bad situation and especially when
you start seeing large quantity of flyers I believe that one female can lay
300 at a time like that's pretty much I think that's the the amount so the
flyers are really really important to keep down as well and you can use
different sprays it depends on if you're in a home garden or in a regulated space
I do have a hard time I don't always like to recommend specific products I
think I've pretty much used everything at this point and you're only allowed to
use certain things within the regulated market so I have used natural and other
forms of BT I definitely try to spray down the flyers and I've used multiple
different things like stuff oil X just to kill the flyers but using some sort
of root drench with some sort of as a direction product or depending on what
you're allowed to use within the framework but some sort of drench is
kind of imperative can you can you use a Bavaria Batsy Anna at skip for for
commercial yes and we do and we've used the very best I have had mixed success
I've also had different success using products with rosemary acid from rosemary
is another another thing and there's varying products on the market that
acid you know I personally just feel like it's like you're saying London it's
an imbalance to me anytime I see even a small amount in the population so it's
also something to be very cautious of when you're working with a soil supplier
and you're bringing in soil there's a lot of brands on the market right now
that are you don't want to be importing and most of the fungus nuts I've ever
dealt with came in with a shipment of soil and so it's very very important
that you know your supplier you talk to them on a regular basis and obviously it
can happen I mean I've seen it happen with more intense pests also but it's
very good to have a good relationship with where you're getting soil from and
making sure that you're bringing in clean soil into your facility or your
home or wherever so those are some of the things that have worked for me I
mean it's kind of like a I'd say it's one of those things when you have a pest
that has a more complex life cycle which fungus nuts kind of qualifies as that
because there's a larva in the soil and then you have the adult flyers then
you're gonna need to use a multi-pronged approach and so those are some other
things to keep in mind and yeah I don't know there's a lot there my brain is
kind of like you could kind of go on about it for a long time but I'm sure
other people have perceptions of what's worked. I'd love to take this opportunity to say
hello to Eric and hello to Ashley on stage who's come up but I'm gonna throw
this one over to Eric because I think it's an interesting point especially
with greenhouse which is with his greenhouse experience what kind of is is
the threshold because of course you know IPM is very important and we're putting
out in the Elastic Tab to kind of see that what is kind of the threshold of
this breaking point when we know it's actually become a problem because one or
two a few here and there is it really an issue like how many per square is
there like a number per square inch that the industry is using as a standard or
is it like is it are we still figuring that out a little bit what's your kind
of opinion on that Eric? I mean the tracking system is a little bit
different from farm to farm or company to company depending on who you listen
to and what Evian was saying is is good about dating the sticky cards and so
what we do is we date the sticky cards put them out and then either within a
couple days within one week you pick an interval and you count how many are on
there and gives you an idea of how high the pressure is but for me I mean when I
start to see a couple here and a couple there I already know I got to do
something about it because when you're doing things at scale a lot of this
shit can go out of hand quick and you know when you look at most farms or you
look at fungus gnats in general I mean they lay their eggs in moist soil
decomposing leaves and things like that and so when you have a lot of these
farms that have a lot of decomposing materials around there's soil bins
there's old soil soil being dumped out I mean and there's just habitat really
everywhere you look for a fungus gnat in particular to lay their eggs and do
their things so I mean it's it's it's a pretty common pest to have around but
what I also notice is that when we're you know heavily feeding in the nitrogen
side of things and starting to go into anaerobic conditions is when the fungus
gnats definitely show up and I deal with them a lot in the cocoa I mean the farms
and most of the farms in the greenhouse side of things that I deal with aren't
using soil so it's all soil this Cocos and rock walls and and things like that
and the fungus gnats can can take over no matter what medium it is really at
the end of the day and so really I'm a big fan of constantly analyzing
everything and so kind of I guess going back to when I first joined the
conversation was hearing about the soil thing is that you know I use a few
different labs as far as soil analysis goes as far as you know doing a mineral
and NPK analysis and also using a different lab for microbiology analysis
and then we're also testing our recipes every two weeks sending those into a lab
to really try to dial in you know you know basically the recipe the recipe and
what we're delivering to the plants and being able to qualify if not every week
every two weeks that everything that we're doing is exactly what it's
supposed to be the irrigation side of things really gets tricky too because
everybody's heavy-handed on the watering and so over watering alone is a great
place for fungus gnats because they love soil you know moist soil that's where
they lay their eggs and so at the end of the day it's really easy to attract
fungus gnats with the fact that a lot of people over water we tend to see some of
these recipes across the get kind of crazy and definitely go anaerobic and so
it makes for a good host and like Evian was saying and some other people you
know the naturals the sticky cards are great the soft oils and things like that
Steiner steiner EMA nematodes help in a lot of those cases but I like to really
be preventative or ahead of it instead of you know being in the battle side of
things and so as long as I'm drilling down on a lot of those analytics that I
already talked about quite often we don't really run into the fungus gnats
very much one of the big worries I'd say with like fungus gnats that like I
always like fear of especially in living soil and like cocoa you can get away
with it and some other like soilless mediums you can get away with it but if
you're like Eric is saying in a place like a greenhouse setting that has a
compost or even has like a neighboring like farm like next to you or anything
and you have a living soil system fungus gnats are great at transporting
fusarium and getting fusarium out of your soil is really hard and that's like
my biggest worry when I see fungus gnats it's like they're they've been studied
multiple times as great transporters and it's just like that's my biggest like
worry it's just like a fusarium no no no no no doubt so so since you're there
actually like I've always kind of had this as a puzzling thought like what do
you have to what do you run into for pest issues in aeroponics with that type
of thing because that I mean if there was a pest that I think could find this
bath to take hold it would probably be we fungus gnats in aeroponics but I'm
like I would be torn to see like an environment that would be completely
ideal for a pest to get into like do you run into fungus gnats as a problem in
aquaponics or like I mean you probably have brain fly here and there but is
there is there a major pest issue or is there so many protocols in place that
you don't really get to that no I mean the thing about it is you know working
in a large-scale production to you know you're gonna have some of your employees
who are home growers and you can't stop them from doing it but it's smart for
you to kind of develop a program that helps them have good practices in their
home grow to avoid them bringing anything into yours but even with all of
our protocols we've ran into a fungus gnats here and there now because we're
fully aeroponic we find them usually around kind of like the rims of the
table where water and nutrients get trapped and you can actually see I have
a full-time IPM specialist and she she's fantastic and she'll go through and kind
of upload videos and everything we haven't had significant pressure
luckily from any anything that we've encountered because I follow that same
motto of you have to be preventative while you can you can be preventative
with everything I mean we we utilize beneficials throughout our entire grow
and had you know all these different companies come in and per the experts
from these beneficial companies you know they've come in and we've shown
them what we're seeing and they're like oh this is nothing you know a couple of
fungus gnats here and there while never comfortable according to these guys what
was a very common thing and so being aeroponic we are lucky because we don't
bring any outside medium and which I know is likely the biggest vector like
the other panelists were saying so if you can be preventative about it you can
you can avoid a lot of heartache down the line but we have used the Delos show
so the rover beetles they're badass you can just see him crawling around and
hunting so cool but there's a lot that you can do the thing about growing in my
opinion is you have to be preventative if you find an issue be curative but
then after that point just make sure you've got your eyes on that learn from
that learn what you did to correct that and you know move forward the best
practices that you possibly can because you can save a hell of a lot of issues
just by making sure you have somebody or some time carved out to be dedicated to
that because it's it's important we take all this time to grow this beautiful
plant and to kind of lose sight of the things that you know microbes and pests
they're not usually on people's minds because they're small or you know those
aren't the things that you think you're going to have so take time talk to
companies that you can call and get advice from I can't stress that enough
don't just go to the store and buy something off the shelf call companies
like bio works and bio safe has a great cannabis program I mean you could they
can hand you what they what they recommend as a cannabis IPM program so I
think that's available to anybody who's curious very great program but yeah you
just have to make sure that you're you're looking at those things that you
didn't think that you should now I don't think you have to be crazy about it but
just make sure you carve out some time each week and stick to that schedule
dedicate 20 minutes to looking at a couple plants here and there when you're
developing a scouting regimen and the sticky traps and you guys all of your
suggestions have been awesome because that's kind of what we have built into
our program but write notes put out sticky traps if you're seeing certain
and go count each one of your cards you don't have to go inspect every plant but
if you go through tackle a couple of them write down what you're finding and
then sweep back you know do your treatment and then sweep back the next
couple days and see your observations so just be diligent about what like what
you're doing make sure you take really good notes you guys will hear me say
that all the time but you learn so much about what works and what doesn't and to
somebody else's comment earlier I've learned more about fucking stuff up and
screwing stuff up then I have just if I were to walk in and it all worked so
well mistakes suck you learn a lot from them so yeah and on that mistake part
like you know sometimes no matter what you do shit is gonna go wrong so like
first and foremost don't beat yourself up I know at scale it's a lot different
it could cost you your job and stuff but I'm not really talking about scale I'm
talking about personal growers and stuff on a smaller scale like that's the
number one thing don't beat yourself up if something goes wrong just keep moving
forward and that's my TED talk I think you touched on it on a big thing is
that mistakes have even a I think at large scale things go wrong and things
happen and it's about how we step up recover and move forward through them
deal with the challenges that we have stepping in the things that we do and
move forward and do and I think the note-taking thing is like so critical I
can't tell you how many times because I'm a terrible like I'm fucking
horrendous but I do video documents so like what I do is like for me for
note-taking I'm just so bad at it that I'm like you know what if I do a video
and drop it once a week I have to shoot it so what I do is I'll shoot a video
and talk while I'm doing it so if I need to come back and do notes just because
I'm not very right everybody's got their way find one that works for you
that that works really well but I can't like I was saying I can't tell you how
many times I've written in a situation where it's like I did some it's like
this didn't turn out quite right I'm like oh yeah I forgot to put this at
this point in time why didn't I put in the the compost ball that I was
planning to do under the root I missed that on this one this one's clearly
showing a deficiency so it's like it's really nice to be able to look back on
those notes so I can actually like look back and check on that stuff but yeah I
can't stress on the importance enough Derek hmm sorry I was just gonna say
real quick London that's a that's a great way to do it too I'm a very visual
person if I could take as many videos as I wanted I wouldn't know where to store
it all but that's a great tool for anybody to use because you can see where
that plan is at that stage too versus just kind of reading it on a piece of
paper so that's a great great tip on them well and then you can share it like
I I think everybody's at least a bit and seen one post on Instagram at least one
thing on Facebook where somebody's shown a picture of their bud and usually been
in a newer guy or even more experienced people and they didn't realize that you
know this one yellow leaf looks like it's probably got bud rot and they go to
pull that yellow leaf out and guess what there's fucking bud rot there so like
putting this stuff up and sharing and even if there are some problems I mean
it's great identity I think one of the worst things we do is a fucking community
is we're all see self-righteous pride fucking people that want to show like
only the best of what we fucking do and I think it's actually a little bit
counterproductive because then we don't teach about the stuff that we that goes
wrong because we all want to be these perfect people and like gardening isn't
perfect life is a perfect things aren't perfect these imbalances are exactly
that there are balances there are ways and checks of balances ways to get
around it so it's a little bit of food for thought there I mean is that the top
of the hour so I will do a quick reset while I've got well I've got a sound
board to bounce off of this future cannabis project ask a cannabis nerd
we're a weekly panel where you can come in and ask questions grow with us we
have a few people that came in on their first day ever they're starting to set
up their first grow and we're growing along with them so so come in come in
regularly and if you have any questions I love growing with all of you guys so I
love being part of that so let's keep it going and do that so come up over
here on clubhouse if you're in future cannabis product you want to write a
message go ahead there if you want to shoot an email to us in the background
because you don't want to like you know out yourself or have it a fuck up go
ahead and do that but we won't harm you because I think it's better for the
community in general as we move forward now Derek I see you on stage there
brother and wow you got quite quite the quite the profile there I've seen you
been here for a while so you probably don't run into many issues or have any
columns did you have run into anything this year that we could talk about on
the panel here or maybe you do have a specific question you'd like to ask go
ahead there you can PTR while we're waiting
okie-dokie well anyways Derek you we appreciate you and if you get available
there we're gonna move on Al welcome to the stage Al Jones do you have a
question for our panel of experts today I do good evening everybody the last guy
that spoke I thought that was an awesome perspective and very effective I would
imagine as far as taking those notes all the way through your you know through
your cycle so yeah that's that was a jewel question I have and there's just
kind of off the bat scrubbers like filters as far as the smell I'm in a
place whereby you know I don't want to be offensive and of course you know a
basic fundamentally a scrubber filter you know it's supposed to do the job
certain strains that I run I run into the filter right the filter the
filtration working but it almost seems like there's a radius outside of that
filter you know that it's able to stay around but you know it's you know it's
just really loud have you has anybody found any other techniques ozone
generators or any other techniques that might work more efficiently as far as
like masking smell so three my question just before you go to it I just want to
clarify so are you looking for an alternative because of the noise issue
coupled by the fact that it's not working 100% or it's not working 100%
you're looking for an alternative and ozone generator will clean up the smell
really well just keep that door closed and don't be in there while it's running
that's that's the only other method that I've used personally so we're just
scrubbing the air you know basic basically yeah the thing about well
first of all good congratulations now because a lot of people wish they had
your problem of an overly stinky crop that is the idea that's what we're all
looking for that's what we all rot right so congratulations on finding a
great pheno it's clearly you pulled that off now the one of the the tooth that
your standard in my opinion your standard go-to for air filtration is in
general a carbon filter these are what's been running and been doing well so if
you have a carbon filter usually the big equator of the problem with the carbon
filters is the fan that's being used in conjunction with the carbon filter now
there is an option like usually even like a stealth fan you can get more
expensive fans that run a bit cheaper but when you start pulling a bunch of
air through a carbon filter you need something of that larger power now what
people don't usually see in their typical hydroponic sections in some of
their stores that is probably available is actually a muffler extender so you
have you could put a carbon filter on one end and kind of a muffler on the
other end to quiet the noise a little bit can help there but I think the the
the I think Cheddar's on the way right Johnny or does anybody else have an
alternative methodology for this I got you how you can make your own so we try
to keep our air quality I mean ideal as anybody would but do it inexpensively
inexpensively I don't know if I'm saying that right but you take a box
then you get filters so we use like Merv 13 which is a pretty robust filter so
you could probably maybe go a step down but you get your typical 20 by 20 by 1
filter you put four filters around that box fan and you could put a fifth one on
the back but to avoid that filtration system like creating a vacuum in itself
you have to create a baffle around the the circle of the box fan I can post the
link because I just learned about these and they're fascinating to me but you
can kind of put that in the room I mean see if that helps with the smell without
having to do anything are you so you're talking about while the crop is growing
correct you need something to filter the air is this post harvest you know it's
well well while you're running harvest and it's like yeah I have one of those
those mufflers that you talk about and you know a high CFM running fan and you
know it's a vortex and it's kicking but it just seems like for some reason it's
just there's a there's a radius if I could explain like an invisible radius
and it just seems to get outside of that you know it doesn't go past it but it's
outside of you know where it needs to be and I don't know it just seems like
you know some strains do that you know more you know like you know they're there
a lot more noticeable than others gotcha so that might not apply to you that
would be more for like air purification but to actually neutralize an odor
that's an that's an interesting I wish I knew kind of what you were what your
radius was involving because I'd love to be able to learn what that was being
caused by but hopefully anybody needs to make an air purifier and what you're
growing yeah right so it's the Northern California Hell's Angel cut OG and that
shit crazy so I'll personally I I have no use for a carbon filter I don't have
to really be discreet about smell right however I know that negative pressure is
really essential to have your carbon filter act are functioning at 100%
efficiency so I'm not sure if if you have do you just have an exhaust or do
you also have an intake what's your kind of exhaust and intake situation looking
like right so you know the rooms mapped out and everything you know you know
basic fundamentally put together so there's exhaust you know a nice size
exhaust and you know death or excuse me the intake you know there's a nice size
intake and you know a larger exhaust to complement it and it's pulling you know
with a negative air pressure and I don't know I just trying to get you know as
long as we're asking questions trying to get you know just little tidbits on
how to mask the smell a little bit better because you know it's not that
it's not working but I'm just I guess maybe a little bit a little bit more
conscious about it and I know that you know I can smell it outside of there so
that would be a good direction I think they're there now like I like I mentioned
you have a problem that people a lot of people want to have but yeah I was trying
to think if there's like another plant that you can put out that that kind of
will help deter that a little bit further I mean it really if there's a
radius of air around it where there's there's a smell or aroma it might be
yeah it might be there might be a leak somewhere where air like I think that's
what Johnny was getting on somewhere airs getting through either the muffler
or like or the carbon filter or in the air exchange and it's just a tiny little
bit just enough to create that that radius that you're talking about not
enough to be heavy but enough to create a large enough a little bit of an aroma
in this space so what might not be a bad idea for now until next week when you
can come back and let us know when is is I would double check your seals like I
check the seals of the room and around your carbon filters and stuff like that
maybe just throw another layer of tape of ducting tape on there just to make
sure there isn't a little gap where it's pushing air through a little confined
space that's not going through carbon filter or something like that might aid
the situation a little bit because that would be my theory if it's not working
properly maybe there's something wrong with it do any of the other panelists
have another idea and or do you have any follow-up questions or have we answered
it go ahead John L when's the last time you changed the carbon filter it's like
yearly okay it's just it's been an ongoing problem for years and it's like
mind-fucking me yeah only thing I can think of is the seals and I didn't know
if it was a me problem or if this is a problem that a lot of people have and
you know sealing your room are there certain certain ways that people go
about doing that that work better than others who sealed a few rooms in their
life I've been a setup a setup a space or take up a whole space room type of
guy but I had a my understanding is like that to apply that black white plastic
and then just just ducting and then just duct tape it's kind of the ways to make
sure that it was so that's what I've always seen done in my experience a when
setting up a smaller space inside of a space but be when you're kind of putting
your protective layer on your wall because you really like I don't think
it's super great to have a open-bare wall and you have a follow-up question
for us out no thank you guys awesome brother hope to see you again next week
keep on growing with us we appreciate it Jeff it's good to see you brother
haven't seen you for a bit haven't heard your voice for a while how you
doing and what do you have for us today do you have a question comment
statement something you'd like to discuss the challenge you had last year
what is it go ahead so I just want to say thank you guys for having me on here
and there were some great ones and Ashley yes I wish I could actually
comprise all my notes together because I always scribble down crap and then I
don't know where I put it but always don't change but here's something I've
noticed so in the old days and I'm going back a quarter century we used to
trade plants so we have a really good genetic and we don't want to lose that
genetic but of course we're already growing that genetic so we would talk to
one of our friendly growing partners and say yo man you got you ever tried this
put this on your farm see what it does and now there's like less I'm just
seeing is it because I've went down in people there is less people to trade
your plants with does anybody else agree or disagree with that I've heard
this issue happening a lot and I think there's been kind of this mentality or I
think it's two things I think you have a ton of people coming in to the market
that are just not familiar with the previous culture but also just don't
know and don't really want to share and then they find these things that are
special to them and then they get this kind of I call it Scrooge's somewhere
they just want to hide it away and keep it for themselves when really these
things are better as you've experienced and I've experienced before in our life
this is a better out in the community a you can get the back you don't have to
worry about losing them but yeah are you seeing this mostly in your area I've
heard of it a little bit internationally but like I've not really heard of it heard
of it so much in California my understand is people are still pretty
pretty passing them around but there is also that caution of a lot of rot and
other issues coming up like not rotten others but viral issues late in the hot
thyroid you know like stuff like that being a caution so is that maybe causing
an issue in that area because that's something that's coming up like what's
your opinions on that maybe Eric you're in the area too what's your what's your
Oh sharing plants I mean homegrowers I mean as far as I know and at least my
network people are still sharing plants and and you know certain cuts I mean
sure people prize certain things and they don't want to share as much but
that's always been kind of the nature of the beast trying to find your own winner
but when things get popular everybody wants a cut and so hopefully a buddy has
one they'll give it to you type of thing but when it comes to the license side of
things the you know the legal side is a little bit more difficult and
challenging and so some farms find their genetics by going to nurseries and you
know we just had the harvest ball in Santa Rosa which was put on by the
people from the Emerald Cup and you know there was a lot of genetics there to be
had and people could you know buy those you know personal you know clones and
things like that and so you know I think the big point of it all is to those the
contamination factor it used to be oh we'd get clones from friends and they'd
have bugs or we'd get clones from somebody and they'd have you know some
kind of pest or something and maybe PM but now like you mentioned London the
hop latent viroid is really a serious issue and I don't know that a lot of
homegrowers you know have had to deal with it quite as much or maybe if they
have I don't know if they've experienced kind of the shit show that we have on
the license side but when you start having nurseries pumping out thousands
thousands of plants with this hop and the catastrophes that go on from farm
to farm because of this and there's no restitution you know nobody's giving you
your money back and if they give you clones it's like you gotta hope that
those ones are gonna be clean too so you know I just think that the whole sharing
thing in light of even you know where things are with everybody's health and
the risks that are out there now everybody's starting to kind of lock
down for a lack of better words so you got to be at the right place at the
right time I think yeah Eric I'm the hop latent thing that could be you know
devastating to to a new grower or even an experienced grower if they're not
familiar and they're they don't realize they have it in their their space
especially if they're counting on that space to generate you know whatever it
is medicine for themselves smoke for themselves money it can really be
devastating and cut into all the those the quality the quantity and just and
really you know in all people's confidence when they're growing if
they're growing and they're like I don't know what I'm doing wrong but I keep
having issues with my plants that could be enough for someone just to throw in
the towel because they're just discouraged so I hop late in getting
into my space personally it's it's one of my greatest fears if I have a bunch
of genetics that I really enjoy and want to keep around and I'm taking cuts of
other things that I get from other people it can really wreak havoc in a
commercial setting and on a home grower setting so I totally second that yeah I
agree with you on the experience part of it a lot of the home growers that I've
listened to and talked with over the course of clubhouse seem to you know I
pop a couple seeds I'll get a couple clones if they don't work out I'll do it
again kind of thing and like you were saying though the experience is really
important to all this and it definitely gets fucked up and it even happens at
scale like I mean when you go to a room with Arizona with you know 3,500 plants
or whatever and things are starting to do it out I mean the experience is it
cascades oh yeah for sure I worked in a nursery and combating hoplite and was
just a non-stop battle testing it's you know it evades testing a lot of times
it'll be in one branch and not another branch so you'll you'll send in a test
and it'll be clean you think you're you're you know ready to go and then
you send in another branch and it comes up as is positive for having it and it
spreads like wildfire in those in a commercial nursery setting in particular
it's so so challenging and tricky to combat and and it's something that I'm
genuinely concerned about even even getting into potentially wild cannabis
populations in one way or another that could be just so so bad for for you know
the whole community in the the genetic diversity and in like vigor of the plant
overall it could it could fuck things up so I'm hoping to see a lot more
research in the coming years as it's becoming more and more of an issue and
more and more research is being done with cannabis and I'm hoping we could
come up with a good way to combat it other than a tissue culture yeah I agree
and I mean I'm not a hundred percent sold on tissue culture working for
hoplite and byroid I mean at least at the Marist them and no I've gotten it
from the tissue culture nurseries I mean that's the problem is that I've had
I have PTSD from hoplite and byroid as a consultant because the four farms that I
was dealing with and consulting for bought plants they didn't have their own
nursery stock so you know I spent a lot of time dealing with a lot of different
nurseries and and it was it I can't believe farms have to deal with that you
know like I mean I just yeah it's it's astonishing to me and and a lot of the
stuff didn't show up till it was a teen so the babies or clones might test
negative the moms in some cases will test negative and then the teens
subsequently when they go to a farm and I feel like that's where some of the
stressors are the moms are kept at one farm the clones are taken everything is
kind of consistent to a point and then when a farm gets it to another place and
it's ready to flower it goes through a different set of stressors of some kind
because of these different greenhouses and environments even if it's in the
same town and the teens when they're ready to flower man they just that's
when they shit out the hardest for me there's also this this defensive fear
that it creates within all of us to like be worried about passing on something
I'm sure there's a couple of people in this room that are probably gonna think
twice now thinking about passing a clone from one friend to another like if you
don't know you don't know and I did I know Conrad listening needs packing
probably will come up but I'd love I'd love his opinion on tissue culture and
and passing poply thyroid if he can't just be brought it up I did give him a
wave there because I I don't know I like have you seen have you seen it happen
it's through tissue culture there Eric or is it just something you're concerned
about because I know it's through it happened through seed is I think I'm not
100% sure no we had a tissue culture we bought a lot of tissue culture plants
from a reputable tissue culture company and they were all the little mini you
know micro little tiny clones that took forever to grow and then when they did
they ended up that the tissue culture company called us and said that they
served us up the hop we didn't actually detect it yet they had called
proactively to let us know that they had fucked up on their end and I'd love to
hear Connors we talked about this before with Connor and some things and I think
what it was talked about is the long the length of time it'll take to clean it up
like I I'm pretty sure you know yeah there's Connor I'm pretty sure tissue
culture will clean it up eventually but you know when is the question I think
yeah hey what's up guys thank you for bringing me up here yeah I mean Marisim
culture it can take months generally for the material to start you know to
get to the point where you can start multiplying it and usually it's
Marisim culture coupled with thermotherapy and maybe some other
things but yeah it really comes down to the ability of your techs and who's
working in the hood because not everybody you know has the same
procedures and SOPs and so it's it's kind of tough not all labs are built the
same so is it a higher probability that it's like is it it was a lack of
procedure being followed that created a cross-contamination or there wasn't a
proper scrubbing to be done like came to tissue culture clean this yeah I mean I
know of many people that have successfully remediated material like
they know for a fact that going into it it was contaminated and then you know
about months later year later they were able to clean it up sorry I'm really
busy right now I appreciate you stepping up here I won't I won't bother you any
more we'll have to have a have an in-depth conversation of this we do have
a few new people on the stage that I would like the opportunity on Jeff
before we end on your comment or statement you have anything else to
follow up with with that did we did we appease appease you with our with our
remarks and statement and move movement towards this hotly by right
conversation thanks for the great question no I was tripping because I
actually bought I was at the cup I was 845 whatever and I bought some from pin
pinners some clones and you know grapes and cream in LA Cush cave and blah blah
blah anyway they look like shit and I'm looking at my beautiful plants in mind
I'm like god man I remember we used to trade a lot more and now you're out
spending money on these genetics that aren't even like they look like they
have a bunch of root or else on them three leaves on there and a couple five
leaves but it's like they're just ugly and I just remember the days of love and
no I have a badass genetic look at the fucking plant leaf on that it's bigger
than your hand these leaves are like the size of my fingers I mean they're needy
little tiny things the whole thing so just Jeff it on that I agree with the
quality of the finest clones man I'm not super stoked on the the one that I
picked up from them it was a really just probably the ugliest clone I've ever
seen in my life super slow I've been slowly bouncing it back but I totally
second that man there they weren't the best to say the least
I'll leave the stage hey you guys happy new year and may you all grow beautiful
plants this year happy new year Jeff thanks for copping on stage and joining
us for a minute Victoria welcome to this stage do you have a question comment or
something for our panel of cannabis nerds today
the whole time I have no idea what you guys are talking about prior so I
apologize for that if I repeat any questions but we're new growers and we're
just I'm just curious as to what gives the buds like girth like you're talking
about sizability and yield like the size of the plant is that that type of
thing I guess the size of the nugs like once it starts flowering because I feel
like we're growing we're growing aeroponics in an aeroponic manner we did
not switch to a deep culture after the roots got to a certain length so we kept
it as an aeroponic row we're basically harvesting now but they're pretty they're
very little like all pretty much little nugs and very airy like they're not full
ooh this is a good one because there's a lot of factors that go into this is my
first question before we get into like asking our panel panel probably is oh
she's gone I was gonna go to Ashley she was she's our air spot aeroponics expert
as well but there's lots of experiences from to help you out my question would
be like what type of lighting do you have usually area buds you is a lack of
lighting in these situations in a home we're oh that's or an early harvests are
usually the two ways that I've leaned but I would ask first I'd ask what type
of what type of lighting that you're doing also what type of plant training
that might have been done for the plant during the period of time and also the
source of your plan like what's the what's what's the genetic background
like what was his cultural heritage like is it did you grow from seed did you
grow from clone did you get something from someone else or what it might be so
if you could answer those I could probably dig in okay so we did grow from
seed we bought them from a website we're in New York so we finally did the bullet
and bought some feminized seeds after we turned legal our lighting situation
is probably not the best I really wouldn't be able to totally answer what
type of light we're using I know we start on an 18-6 schedule and then once
we start seeing flowers we change to a 1212 and I think you have access their
question but I don't remember yeah so do you know what that like the like what
what was the name of the the seed pack and the breeder that you butter them in
the name of it so we bought from homegrown cannabis which I believe is in
Connecticut if I'm not mistaken and we bought if we bought a few different
types so they usually give you like a couple seeds like whatever seeds you buy
they usually give you their theirs their genetic strain which is their I
think it's called delight which is an auto flower and then we also bought a
badass Rolex and bluejack city so the delights flowered and were done and
harvested they were a little girthier than the one we just harvested in our
currently trimming which is the bluejack and badass Rolex it is a true
it's not an auto flower so that one is still it's like just starting to flower
now and then what lastly what day of flower did you harvest your plants at so
that's probably one area where we faulted I mean we both work full-time
jobs so we pretty much set it up to run as much as possible on its own we
barely we basically go in to add nutrients into the water tank other than
that everything is automated we don't have to really do anything but I want to
say we tried for the most part to stick to the like 10 week 12 week photo
flowering period that's a good amount of time does does anybody want to jump in
on this one to get it get the conversation rolling because I think we
got plenty to work with sure go ahead go ahead Eric can I ask another question or
another kind of qualifying question I guess the course the the light so you
were saying that when you're growing the plants and 18 hour cycle of light
and then you start to see flowers you change them to 12 and I'm just wondering
if if that's when you see the auto flower start the flower because if you
have regular plants that aren't auto flowers you wouldn't see flowers until
you change the light to the 1212 and then they wouldn't start making the
flowers so in some cases when we have plants that do a pre pre flower and
veg and then flower again or any of those kind of things they'll be airy but
that's one one way to get a puffy not very tight you know airy bud so to speak
is having pre flower and re veg flower it's hard to see sometimes when you have
a clone and they start to pre flower it might be just a little you know three or
four more white hairs than what you would normally see and then it can go
back into veg and you don't really notice and then when you go into
flowering it just kind of the plant gets a little tripped out by some of those
things and so just from listening to what you were saying my advice would be
without asking a bunch of more questions just make sure your lighting situation
is dialed in regardless of what the auto flowers are doing because they're gonna
do their thing they don't need 1212 they could be on 20 hours of light and
they're still gonna flower so pay attention more closely to the the non
auto flowering plants and work with those and let the auto flowers do their
thing so that's basically what we did we did let the auto flowers I want to say
the auto flowers totally flowered on the 18-6 cycle I don't think they made it to
the 12-12 cycle but once we saw potential signs of flowering in the in
the indica strain we did switch the lights to 12-12 I want to say that
plants been on on a 12-12 cycle now for probably close to a month again one
thing we're not great with is writing dates down and keeping a journal with
notes and everything so the next round that we grow we're gonna try and really
commit to keeping that journal a little better but we definitely did we have
pictures of of the progress and we tried to take like the flowering dates from
the pictures and then we harvested off of the picture dates so the auto flowers
definitely totally grew veg and flowered off an 18-6 cycle the lights weren't
really switched over until we saw the potential for the pre flowers on the
indica strain and I the second auto flower only lasted in the tent on the 12-12
cycle for maybe like two weeks
interesting yeah whoa okay yeah you know I mean sometimes when you let plants go
too long when they're overripe they can also open up again you know overripe pot
you know will will tend to start to in you know open itself up again rather
than stay tight so I mean it also could be a recipe thing you know too much
nitrogen you know some of those things but you know if you're a home grower and
you're just getting into this this is some of the things that we all go
through and so lucky for you there's Clubhouse and you know there's always
been books and things around and stuff like that but you know I'd maybe let
some of the other panelists chime in but to me I would just definitely drill
down on the lighting and make sure that you know which ones are autos and which
ones aren't because I'm still thrown off a little bit by the indica plants
showing flowers and then that's what triggers you to put them to 12-12
because they shouldn't pre flower until you change it to 12-12 and then you
should start to see some flowers so that that's where that's why you know I was
just mentioning sometimes the pre flower plants and and re veg will be
kind of airy sometimes all right that's yeah that's definitely good to know it's
definitely a possibility that that is what's happening so as far as lights go
is there any kind of like specific brand or like hue of lighting that is better
over another all right so I think this is like a for the ladies that I just
want to touch back before we could jump on a lighting there to just bring up
one more point that I think we should touch on just before we do is is when
you're rolling when you're also when you're growing from seed even if the
depending on how the breeder is I'm not aware of them I don't know if anybody
else's but the the consistency of the plant can be highly variable so a lot of
the people on this panel or in general that are trying to get the most
consistency you get like you know that really consistent hard dense now on a
very regular basis are usually growing clone clone propagated mother plant
asexually propagated mother plants they're a lot more consistent and by
able to be done so that way you kind of know what you're gonna get out of it and
you know what systems you're gonna go in now when you pop a seed there's quite a
bit of variability in there and and that you know you could be getting plants in
that with that variability of the loose buds that could be a kind of a factor of
what you're getting you could just not be having the right seed to come out
doesn't mean that the cannabis is bad we all have these we all have these very
in-depth perspectives of like what we see like bag appeal and what's a great
strain and like how much THC content is there is like important and all these
little facts and you know really none of them like when it comes down to it so
THC really isn't all that important you know 50% THC plants can can produce nice
and some of the some of the the plants with the highest THC and that get you
the most hooked up they don't even look like something you'd want to find in a
bag like it's just not very common there's a lot of work that's been done
and a lot of these are outliers or individuals that are special or unique
in their case and that's why you see that so it's actually kind of to get
your first row done and like is this your first full round first or second
full round so we started trying to grow old seeds first before New York turned
legal cuz my I had a bunch of seeds from an ex but not we couldn't get them to do
it like they wouldn't even pop so once we finally turned legal we were we were
confident or felt a little bit more you know stable I guess with buying online
and having them delivered so that was this is probably our third our third
round of growing actually I take that back the old seeds did pop but most of
them turned into hermaphrodites and so we ended up just tossing them after a
certain point so this is our third round but our first time getting to
flowers and the other thing I was gonna say was we did as I said grow from seed
so the variable like you're talking about I'm we're definitely seeing the
one one of our plants that we just harvested I was showing pictures to
somebody and they were like oh that's a hermaphrodite you should probably get
that out of there before it starts making seeds in your other plants and
then somebody else was like no it's not a hermaphrodite it's probably actually
what somebody hasn't seen in a really long time they told me it was a true
hundred percent sativa so it really has like nothing on it so that one was
interesting and then again to the variable in terms of seeds one of our
indica strains actually is what I call a triplet you can go inside Dom I'll be
in a minute it literally looked like the ugliest thing when it popped out of the
seed and started growing out of the out of the pot and I was certain on getting
rid of it and just dealing with the stronger ones and you know the ones that
looked more appropriate and it took forever for it to get some height and
growth but once it finally did it turned out that it was three stems coming out
of one seed and two of them look like a Siamese twin with a third like triplet
if you will that's possibly that it was an actually a poly embryonic triplet
plant I've had triplets and twins pop out of my plants and quite often it's
gonna look like one of part of its growing extremely slower than the rest
because of how they were produced in the seed one usually comes in as a runt
compared to the other ones and it's growing they could actually be different
sexes also from that happening yes they look like they're growing differently
within the stems so I can totally appreciate that statement and then
there's also a possibility that what's there if it is the stem extremely thick
in sections and wide instead of round because if that's what's happening it's
a fasciated plant and that can grow out of it it could stay it could be viral
there's multiple different no so it's it's growing the stem itself is is
circular all around all three of them but what I noticed was the fan leaves
like on one of them it's growing on like an 80 degree 180 degree angle so the
families are coming out in like a straight line and then in the other two
stalks the fan leaves are coming out in like a perpendicular type manner
interesting interesting institute so it's a very like unique plan we actually
had a great conversation last night with dr. Anna about about mutations and how
these things aren't necessarily bad and how that they're actually a large part
of the culture in itself so I mean like it's very nice so I would say round
about the what you'd want to do is check out check out a your genetics know that
you're not that it's brothers and sisters you're gonna get some variety
there that's just gonna happen mutations aren't necessarily bad things
sometimes good to keep around the cool ones like most of the weirdos in this
room no offense team as well as just making sure that your plant is healthy
fed and everything like that your lighting is contingent to so do you have
like a big old bulb or you have like a board with a bunch of lights on it that
are maybe like purple or white so we have one that I don't think we're using
that has purple or red and blue light and then we have bulb lights over each
individual plan as well okay well I would have a little bit of a dig into
what type of lighting system use because if you're growing indoor that could be a
large contingent on the essentially the amount of energy that the plant has to
produce density or more plant leaf or matter now I don't want to take too too
long I would like to get because we actually usually cut this about an hour
and a half we're gonna go to two hours day because we don't have another show
starting right after this one but do we've given you a lot to work with at
this point in time do you think we've helped you out there is there something
else that we could help you with before we move on to thank you awesome well
invite you to come back and come back next week we're here every single
Wednesday so come back next week and we can get go through your go you could
show us some pictures even on your thing and I think you nailed it there
one thing that I did like I mentioned earlier with taking notes is I actually
like take videos instead of notes so I talk about the plants a little bit and I
do this to kind of because I'm that guy I'm terrible at taking notes so your
photo taking is highly valuable so like take your photo it's got data on your
photo that you like say what day it takes so take a photo when it's in the
flower maybe give yourself a thumbs up in the photo so when you're scanning
through it's easy to find so there's your hand in it and it's easy to do what
I'll sometimes do is if I'm gonna go through and photograph some plants and
document it is I'll take a picture of a sheet of paper with the date and what
I'm taking a photo of and because that'll be there I'll be able to very
easily kind of move in between it'll be like hey I'll be scrolling through it's
like hey there it is bring it up okay that's the date that I'm looking for
what happened or so on and so forth can be super super super helpful I hope that
that helps to go in there because not all of us are note takers but some of
this stuff is super helpful Evian did you want to jump in there I just want to
say that I am a note taker but I'm also like I think that the video logs are
really fantastic and I was just going back over my video logs from this past
year yeah I think your matrix you're in the digital so Derek I see you back
coming in and out are you available did you have a question or a comment for
experts there but I am thank you for the space I have a comment in a question
I've been in the room from the beginning so I wanted to just comment
and say I am from New England but I love New Jersey I think it's definitely a
great place that gets a bad rep but my question I have a dispensary and I'm
more of a flower guy I have a new supplier that just came out that's
organic that's doing solvent list stuff that's fantastic and they sold me
something that they claim is a full melt bubble hash and my understanding of
a full melt product is when you are consuming it if it burns it's not full
melt and if it melts it's full melt and I had a bud tender who took the product
it was the consistency of it was a little closer to Keefe and she put it in
a peak and it burned but the the supplier is telling me that if the
consistency is more like Keefe sometimes all you'll need to do is just roll it
between your fingers and put it in parchment paper and then when you do
that to the product that it will melt and do you do you guys confirm with that
do you have any knowledge or what would you consider would you think that this
is a full melt or or slightly below full melt that all comes down to quality of
the product passed to you but if they passed you a Keefe and it does not melt
with a lighter above it without actually touching it you don't have full melt it
should not have to be processed into another form for it to then melt so if
it did not melt as Keefe that means it's a still has a ton of contaminants in it
there's a lot of stalag cares there's going to be stems from the trichomes in
there there's probably still some pistols and staph or actually stigmas in
there so that's what's keeping that from melting so what they want you to do is
activate those oils by rubbing it together and forming it into a hash that
some will melt but you're still going to end up with a ton of contaminants at the
end that will not melt so which is still hash yes still hash but not not all hash
will melt and it doesn't have to melt to be a quality hash either I guess I
didn't mean to say like that I guess I meant to like define it separately like
it's not full melt that's hash you know like kind of what you were saying like I
was trying to like yeah never mind don't mind me don't mind me no no get into it
because I think there's a definition here that that that that's hard to play
because I know there's lots of people that get confused about the whole
rosin raw hash rosin hash hash rosin thing I mean there's like if you go
check out Jindal Hendrix she's very good at processing plant matter into top
grade hash and you can go to her page and see some of her static tech cleaned
trichome heads that some people would consider to just be Keith because of the
way it looks and appearance but as soon as any form of heat gets to that that
stuff will melt and just disappear completely because it's been reduced
down to nothing but the the bulbous head of the trichome which is holding
everything that we're after so you can make it 100% it just has to be processed
into that just because it's in that form does not mean it is a full melt and
Joda she'll be on his show tomorrow night oh yeah man she gin and you guys
should listen up anyone interested in any type of hash I think she's in Maine
isn't she Tony yeah gin man she's she knows yeah I think she's done this one
cups yeah she knows what she's doing 100% yeah I think she's down in Southern
Maine there Maine baby Maine yeah and I think to put it into context for some of
the listeners or you know when it comes to the to the full melt nowadays it's
changed it's evolved right hash has been evolving all this time and to the point
where a lot of stuff we see is being the new you know hype or full melt or
whatever is is basically the fresh frozen version of hash where they're
actually freezing in the plant material and then making the hash and the heads
just like mr. Toad was saying the heads are what's considered the full melt and
that goes to hash where the stocks are what's pressed into rosin and so you
know a lot of us might even look at it you know what's in the bag or in a jar
of the stocks before it's going to be pressed and actually look at it as
incredible looking hash but it's nothing compared to the heads themselves and so
I mean if it doesn't drip like water it's not full no so is that the standard
of the test would you like put it on a needle and just put a lighter underneath
it and if it drips it it melts then that's full melt or just dab it in the
puff coat like you already did I mean if it leaves a residue and kind of cakes up
then yeah you got a problem but if it melts and turns into a little puddle
like it would have any other good dab you know an oil dab it leaves oil at the
bottom that you got to use a q-tip to clean out I mean that would be
considered the full melt but you know if it leaves char then then we're talking
about a lower grade material one thing you could do with that Keith product is
go through a pressing with it and press it with a with a hydraulic press and do
what everybody's doing with buds but just deal with the teeth they will
remove all the contaminants out of there basically by running that through a
couple bags of 25 micron just run them on the press and everything that comes
out of there will be 100% full melt you're just gonna end up losing a
percentage of the weight that's the contaminant so I when I press a key say
I have 10 grams out of that 10 grams I'll probably get eight to eight and a
half grams out of it and that leaves me with a gram and a half of product that
basically was contaminant but or could be the stocks and the systolic hairs
from the plant that could also be used in some kind of a fecal product if you
want to make it concentrate in that form that can be used for lotions or topicals
or rubs or to be pasted people for using as a oral medicine and Sarah I see you
up on say sorry as you've been popping out did you have a question for us today
I think we got you Derek did we get you you did thank you guys you're amazing I
love you nerds awesome hope to see you again but
Sarah do you have a question for us today for the SDS person we'll leave you
as our last one for the evening before we close I did when you came up I did
have to pop the mic on mute because you were given a little bit of background
noise there so you might have to unmute yourself you might not be aware of that
so it's a button on the bottom right but we'll give you a second and I'm not
getting anything I don't know about you guys but I'm not hearing anything Sarah
if you do figure that out go ahead and say hello I want to take a moment
congratulate Connor on graduate waiting I'm here he's getting that a lot lately
but that I'm fucking that's so fucking awesome and and coming back to
California come back like I live there fuck Vancouver go to California so I
mean everybody's excited it will be there dr. Anubis I also want to take a
moment say I'm glad you're feeling better and welcome back to the cannabis
space I had oh there's Sarah are you available there you go can you hear me
yes we can did you have a question or a comment for our panel of experts hi I'm
sorry I was outside and my service kind of goes out at that point so I don't
know if my question is relevant to this group but I because you guys have been
so amazing and overwhelming with all the information I just didn't even know where
to begin but I am a student with the medical cannabis science and therapeutics
program at University of Maryland I graduated in May and I have a son who
has intractable epilepsy so that was my inspiration to start the program and my
question is about chemo bars and I wondered how all of you wonderful people
find chemo bars with specific terpene profiles I'm looking for something that
is high in linalool or carry off lean those are the kinds of things that I'm
looking for but I just don't know of any seed banks that have very legitimate
information on what those seeds carry as far as genetics so there's something
really cool that you have and welcome it to the panel there sir I'm gonna just
meet you when you're not talking just because it does provide a little bit of
background noise I hate doing it because I feel like it's almost like like
putting putting your hand on somebody's they don't talk but it I apologize
thank you very much for understanding so we actually have so mr. toad who is
who is here and I there are a few people in this group that would be happy to
answer that question and are ready to jump I'm sure at it but mr. toad here is
is is a purveyor in my mind in the industry and someone who's spent a lot
of time in in the space trying to you know breed plants for things of this
exact nature and and also is someone who we look at in the community is as a
representation of like actually doing the work but also being very honest and
upfront about it and everything like that so mr. toad go ahead if you want to
get this thing that started going well the first thing I was gonna say is to be
looking at the seed banks that are offering it even if you're talking about
like my own and or if you're just talking about the places that are
sourcing it kind of like dog it does most of those won't be putting up any
type of testing reports because it's a phenotypical expression that's coming
out of the plant most of the stuff that's being passed out there isn't
going to be a hundred percent true breeding for say the land a little that
you're after you so what the things that I do when I'm looking for something to
breed for specific terpene profiles or novel cannabinoids is I start to search
through the actual testing companies in the labs that are doing the testing
because they will actually put up lists of the test reports of the plants that
are out there and it's better for me to find cultivars that already have this
than to try to dig through seed lines to try to find one that may be better at
that point I only dig into those seed lines to find my breeding stuff I'll try
to pick up specific cultivars that are already producing these chemo status
that I'm after by researching through the labs when you find a cultivar that
you'd like you try to find a repeated lab results so that you know that that
cultivars actually producing what you're after I did that tracking down the AC DC
when I was using it for breeding that way I could pull the cut that I wanted
send it back in for testing and then run it through my breeding projects to make
sure I was getting the repeatable results that I wanted because just
because one cultivar may say that it's high in lanolin does not mean it will
breed for that trait it may not be a dominant trait in that plant that's why
I try to find specific cuts and then run those for the medicine that I'm after
because breeding for it takes much much too much time especially when you're
trying to help sick people I understand the epilepsy that you're talking about
my uncle had epilepsy since he was 19 I have a friend that his family calls me
their adopted brother and he's the oldest person in the world that they
know of that has Dervais syndrome and he uses cannabis specifically to stop the
seizures he used to have 300 seizures sometimes a day and they went down to
where he only had three seizures in a month from switching over to using AC DC
as the source of the oil that he has for treating the Dervais syndrome that's
really great I love that question I'm Eric I don't know if you had something
can you guys hear me better now totally okay cool I have just a couple weird
spots on my where I'm at that don't really work so well but I will say
little is just so for people to clarify for people in the audience the little
is the same like kind of dominant terpene that comes across in lavender
also so it's a really healing magical you know I personally love little
dominant cultivars and just it's one of those things that when it comes out as
an expression I find it to be really healing and really enjoy the effect of
things that I've grown that tend to be more little dominant I know that I've
grown scooby snacks and Josie Lotto I think Gushers there's a few other like
blue dream I believe it has like I don't know if it's a little dominant but it
has Jack Frost is something else I've grown that I really enjoyed growing that
had high levels of little and so there are specific in addition to seed banks
for me I really feel like if you can actually access like you know plantlets
or clones from some sort of nursery that's you're gonna get more consistent
medicine with something like Anthony was saying that already you know is known to
have a higher relative amount of one of these terpenes if that's what you're
looking for and there are definitely people out there now that are starting
to really advertise these terpene profiles in their catalogs and so if
you're looking for something specific and it's getting you know breeders best
I know at this point is getting very specific where you're looking even for
something you know that has higher levels of CBC or you're looking for THC
THC V or anything along those lines including different varying terpenes so
I will say there are some people out there that are seeking out these more
medicinal compounds in the plants and making those cultivars and chemovars
more available for people so I would say there's definitely people doing the good
work to share those things and I would look to some of those sources for that
and I think that is a really cool that you're doing that program and
congratulations on getting close to completion.
There's a seed line called lavender from Soma it's high in the land of oil it's another line that
what you can you can find quite a few of the genotypes that are in there that
will produce the land of oil.
And it's it's a feminized too which is kind of nice very very stable there's from I've ran a bunch of seed of it and
there's only from from my experience two two phenotypes they're very floral
lavender, linalool, dominant cultivar it's the more like like medicinal side
once you start sorting through them you'll start to see that there's two
different forms of linalool there's an S and I can't remember the other one but
and they react kind of like differently one's a little bit more sedating and
then one is like one hydrogen molecule off of myrcene which is kind of like a
headier kind of vibe that's kind of anecdotal here but um what's kind of
neat about lavender strain it's a mix of all the skunks too for anybody that
loves skunks the other pheno is like straight skunk like when you smoke it
you kind of feel like your blood rushing type old-school skunk it's kind of a
neat strain but one thing too I was chasing linalool for a while and that's
why I went after lavender and I learned I learned that lavender in its dominance
I I thought I wanted and I'm just like giving you my like anecdotal
kind of experience I noticed that you had said carophylline as well and that's
why I say this is as I realized that I liked linalool as kind of like a
back-end like terpene because in its dominance it didn't necessarily do as
much and that's just like me like personally I found that a lot of the
strains were like it was a kicker it seemed to be a little bit more like
efficient without it you notice that it's not there but when it's like in its
dominance it's not that it's not that medicinal and I don't mean in that way
it's very case-specific my whole point is I wouldn't worry so much on focusing
on that because a lot of the strains especially nowadays like the cookie like
cultivars and stuff they always have this like carophylline limonene linalool
mix which is honestly like it makes so much sense when you look at why they're
there like you can like medicinally but they're they're really common and
they're kind of like really kind of easy to sort through to find one it has that
like carophylline linalool mix and the limonene mixed in just kind of magnifies
everything if that makes sense so I guess I wouldn't worry about that
linalool dominance too much because it's it's now pretty common in a lot of
these these mainstream kind of cookie like cultivars yeah I forgot to add that
too oh sorry Eric I just really say I forgot to add that I really feel the
same way like carry off it seems like a lot of the most popular genetics right
now especially a lot of the there's just so much carry off lean dominance
happening right now and I'm happy to see that I think carry off lean also just
for the audience is the same as black pepper and it really is these different
kind of mixtures so sometimes you'll see it you know where it's slightly more
dominant in one thing but I do notice the very popular right now with buyers
and other things as well as this carry off lean dominant with a little bit of
humulin or limonene and it's just kind of slight variations and all of these
different cultivars and humans so fast yeah and I got it here from Eric I got
it here if you go for it I was just gonna say you can also look at like SC
labs does all the work for testing on a lot of competitions and primarily the
Emerald Cup and so if you look at you know past data that they've collected
especially last year they did everything by dominant terpene profile and so the
whole cup was beta carry off lean for the most part there was probably one
that was dominant in one entry if I can barely remember or two that were
dominated by little so I mean it's really that that one I mean it's worse
than awesome mean to try to put you know like awesome mean was 1% probably
and so when a little definitely a lost her as far as the dominant terpene goes
but the carry off lean for sure was the easiest to find but you know there's
phytology that has the phyto facts which has been adopted by SC labs as well and
another dispensary in Sonoma uses the phyto facts for their education purposes
and you know the breeder Mark Lewis that's really heavy into breeding for
terpenes and things like that that have collected and posted a lot of data that's
out there to look at I was gonna mention that also that catalog their seed
catalog is really beautifully it's probably one of the most cutting-edge
seed and genetics catalogs that you're gonna look at for mainly for cuts I
believe but it's it really breaks it down I don't know why I'm spacing on the
name of that catalog maybe Eric you remember but it's it's really beautiful
really beautiful and I think that those are really great medicines also and I
will say that awesome mean to for me on a personal level is one of my absolute
favorites and I definitely always try to grow things that have that dominance
because it's just something it's it's really good when people when you find
your medicine or what works for you it really is good to try to seek out
different cultivars because generally you're gonna like same the same things
or you're gonna have the similar effect from multiple different genetics and so
really honing in on a few that have that similar profile is really a great tactic
for medicating and then also just for you know knowing what you like and then
knowing which things have it is really I think that's half the battle honestly we
we threw a lot at you Sarah I hope we answered your question with an honorable
in an honorable way is is there is there a follow-up or or do we do like
anything else again I did throw you on mute there so I apologize we'll give you
a minute I'm gonna say hi to CB there did you have one quick question or
comment before we close up the room today CB it's great to see oh yeah thank
you so much for you know just giving me just a quick second I want to come in
congratulate Connor tell him to get back here to the West Coast Best Coast
and I just want to tell everybody I enjoyed this conversation Connor and I
have had a lot of rooms where we talked about beta-cariophiline
karyophylline carophiline however you want to say it it is my favorite terp it
is dominant in my favorite cultivars and I love talking about it and mixed with
paired with linalool is a great combo so I loved hearing that and hope you guys
have a great evening I'm on the bike I really love you guys you guys have been
very kind very supportive and I look up to a lot of you guys I really look
forward to hanging out with everybody when I'm back home much love I want to
do Connor I want to do a series on like how to do I want to do a dank hour on
like how to set up a home tissue culture like miniseries thing I think you'd be
really fun cool we actually had requests for that the other night well
yeah that would definitely be cool no I'm a huge supporter of hobbyist and
and I'm certain that anybody with enough determination and patience can can do it
definitely yeah we'll chat dicey Sarah do you open up there were you able to
say a closing thing beforehand I hope we gave you the answer you're all right
well we appreciate you anyways thank you sir we're gonna make CB for all the
time I thank you Connor for coming oh there we go there you I am so sorry I've
been trying to unmute myself and I was hitting the wrong button I'm so sorry
you've all been really great and thank you very much it's very insightful and
I've been looking on my laptop as you've all been speaking about these various
websites that I'm now putting in my bookmark and I just want to thank you
it's it's definitely a learning experience I have zero in experience in
cultivation our school program is not permitted to teach anything regarding
cultivation due to regulations with the program and so as much as I like to
think I have learned a great global amount of knowledge regarding cannabis
and regards to science and therapeutics the cultivation aspect is very new and
admittedly I feel like I want to be quick as I can in finding the right
chemo bar for my son it's been very difficult and I grew do-si-do and it
worked out very very well and it has been pretty effective I'm really excited
about it I also grew a blueberry CBD which has been really great but I think
I might like to investigate further based on your suggestions so I'm looking
forward to doing that in Virginia I'd also try skim in the mountains and I
have skittles seeds the well if you can track the clone that would be the best
bed for you it's slightly different than what's offered in seed form that's why I
the actual cutting has what you're looking for the seeds you're gonna have
to search through and actually test them for what you're looking for unless you
recognize it which you probably will since that's what you're actually
looking for and then the Roberts Creek Congo is a plant that would work for a
combination of a lot of those turkeys on lower levels but could be used in a
concentrate form that would probably help quite well thank you I will look
into that for sure I want to throw down to just white widow also came when you
were speaking previously that was something that popped into my head and
that for me has historically been just really good especially for pain I don't
know why that one just didn't work so well and I think it may be it's like
very awfully dominance but if you can get a hold of that that can be really
really healing a healing cultivar I'm kidding thank you I think it's a code
really touched in and Eric really touched on some really awesome points
and one thing that I will say that I'll kind of lose this closing note for
everybody as well in this statement that we've actually touched on a couple times
throughout night we were talking a little bit earlier she's actually stepped
away now but she was talking about planting from seed and how there's
variability between seeds and how there is like not 100% consistency it's
it's brothers and sisters and there's not a perfect thing like Mike I wouldn't
expect my two kids to be the same I wouldn't expect two seeds or I'm exactly
the same there are some consistencies that are there but the most consistencies
that are regularly found are in the phone market now we know that there's a
little bit of challenge in that past because we talked about my right into
some of those issues but if you find a good reliable source and of clones and
also of something like mr. toad mentioned like the the cultivars from
harvest cup you can get in clonal format that have been tested so it's not just a
seed where you have to worry a little bit about like you're gonna have to hunt
through it or have that problem you can get that cultivar and then you can ask
even the person that that that put that product and submitted or put out to
harvest or read their bio or the information about their farm and maybe
find a little bit about their methodology about it because the
methodology and where you're growing and the methods that you're growing can
greatly affect the outcome of the plant as well so that that can help at least
really narrow down that space and it sounds like you're on the journey of
exploring planting cannabis which is awesome and a lot of fun and a lot of
cool stuff because it just keeps going going and going going and now I'm just
crossing like random peas at my house for some reason I don't know why but I
feel like it's necessary and you know what I found out the other day comfrey
Evian we have it fucking everywhere here and I didn't realize it was borage like
it's fucking borax just so fucking calm my wife my isn't it I mean it's a
different it is a different plant so borage is different and also you'll
notice the flowers on board you're gonna flowers on board you're actually I love
borage borage is one of my absolute favorite things to grow bees absolutely
adore it and the flowers are so incredibly delicious and you can put
them they're edible and you can put them in little ice cubes and like they're
just really beautiful you're from Oregon yeah how do you know that you're from
Oregon because you know the difference between comfrey and borage also
propagated differently like you're gonna propagate borage from seed generally
comfrey is like you you're gonna do like root cuttings and and slips and there
are different types of comfrey I've totally screwed that up yeah I know we
have borage we have borage and I looked up because I was trying to figure out
what fucking comfrey looked like and I like looked it up the other day and I
saw that they were cut like they were related in some way so I jumped to the
being the same fucking plan and and thank God I didn't do anything other
than state make this one old statement in front of you know well they're both
magical plants and I I think that one thing about borage is it will definitely
self seed and kind of take over your garden it's also I believe another
common name for it is bee balm one thing that's important to remember about if
you actually are working with comfrey and you get your hands on it in a little
different way comfrey is an incredible plant especially for homesteading
permaculture like polyculture realities it has it stacks a little bit more
functions I think than borage you can use it as food for forage for like your
farm animals about my I used to grow it to feed to my rabbits it's an incredible
chop and drop mulch and so that's going to be the subtle difference usually
borage is also more of an annual and comfrey is a perennial and when you
start doing chop and drop though with forage I'm sorry with comfrey you see
how you got me with comfrey it can start spreading and so you need to be careful
that you when you do put comfrey in your beds or allow it into your garden space
you need to be a little bit cautious because it will literally take over in a
very different way underground then forage will just self seed repeatedly so
incredible plants tons of uses tons of medicinal uses on both of those also
beautiful beautiful magical plants and they are same plant family so not
totally fucked yeah yeah they both of them are great for making fermented
plant extracts that are high in potassium and comfrey aeration yeah they
like just the the amount of great things like she was saying medicinal to like
the crazy medicinal things I think that does like healing powers it's kind of
incredible like it's actually a mind-blowing like you you know cut
yourself and then just use like a leaf of like comfrey and like a poultice like
mash it up real quick and put it on there it heals so fast it's it's it's
nuts actually kind of like scary mind-blowing
forage is a nice garnish on soups as well the flowers just fucking cocktails
fucking bore yeah Tony I was gonna totally end up eating no I'm just
kidding I was I was growing borage but I just I while we're at it I know we were
talking about there's a part of the plant that's often disregarded and then
I'm starting to play with a little bit more if we don't I'm not rushing
anywhere and I think conversations go pretty well is anybody else using the
root of the cannabis plant I've read a little bit about cleaning it and doing
that I I've started my wife is like really getting into witchy stuff and
like doing essential oils and stuff like that I'm like well I got all this
fucking biomass that I'm not using for flower do you guys have any
recommendations maybe on fucking cleaning the root cuz fuck that's I can
tell you what I do I soak it I soak the root and then get it out and then you
get a little toothbrush baby and you just start brush brush brushing away and
then you soak it again and then brush again and then I dry it and then I
grind it and I put it in my cold brew tincture that's awesome so I would want
to say just a couple things about the root and the reason that the root is so
this is one of the things for me that makes it so it's a it's just such a
powerful it's fritillin and epifritillin are the things in the root
that you're looking for they're water-soluble they've been used
historically for like healing gout and other things there's an amazing white
paper that Ethan Russo and I'm gonna forget her name off the top of my head
but the Canadian woman I'll try and remember everybody forgets the fucking
Canadian don't they she's really amazing there's a white paper on it and then I
believe that maybe three years ago or something I believe shango did a shaping
fire episode around the roots and back then you couldn't even find a lab to
test for these compounds but they're really incredible they are water
soluble so when you're if you don't want to soak too long in your cleaning
process with the roots because you might start losing some of the medicinal
compounds they are harder to clean the other thing that's incredibly important
is the roots are one of the main places in the plant that you're going to
hyper accumulate heavy metals and so making sure that you're testing you know
those things and making sure that you're not creating medicine that has high
levels of heavy metals and those are just some cautionary pieces of
information but for me as a background as an herbalist I think it's very very
one of the most important overlook things and people say like full-spectrum
medicine I think for a long time I realized we've kind of been missing the
point with cannabis because I feel like the plant has all of these incredible
compounds in all the different places and in traditional herbal medicine when
you say whole plant medicine you're literally talking about using the whole
plant you're using the roots you're using the aerial parts using all these
different things and I think that we've kind of missed them I think we've missed
that and some part of me really loves the consuming all of the parts of the
plant at once and I think that that's where the roots are really really really
powerful and magical and cool that it's water-soluble too so definitely love
that you brought that up London because I think it's a very overlooked part of
the plant well it's so much fucking work I mean no shit
Natasha rise I can tell you my grandmother used to use the roots for
treating gout she would wash the roots with us like a salad spinner she would
just constantly she'd boil them and then soak them in cold water and wash them
repeatedly so they were the state that she liked the mat and then that would be
pulverized into a powder and added to olive oil and she would wrap that around
her knees and around her feet different joints for different types of swelling
usually for gout mostly get a pressure washer yeah that that paper will segment
out of the book was with dr. McGee's and Russo was with Natasha rise I think her
name was Evian and you do you know like do you know if I guess you know if
there's like a shelf life like there is with say like the transition between THC
and THC at all with them I believe that if my memory serves me correctly they're
sterile and so it's they're not it's a different thing and I don't know about
shelf life and stability I know that with THC a it's like that's part of the
issue is stabilizing it I don't think steriles are the same compound you know
like as far as shelf life goes but as with everything you know I've been
really trying to just shift my perspective on cannabis that we work
with you know especially in the regulated market or in larger scale of
what we do is like we work with a we manufacture a product that is not shelf
stable and overall in general and so I like to keep that kind of mentality but
I do love the idea that you can it's a part of the plant just like with the we
used to use the salad spinner and the wheat grass juicer for for the leaves
also and I just think that's such a great resource for for making other
various medicines from the plant I feel like I feel incredible when using those
using those things so yeah I'd be curious to look up how the shelf
stability of of those different compounds I know there's a bunch of
other things in the roots too I think those are just the two kind of main
things that were used for like gout and arthritis and inflammation etc.
I have a lot of roster friends that used to make wine out of the roots they used to make a
medicinal wine that was a low alcohol content but they used to drink that stuff all the time.
Cheddar Bob, Mr. Toad this is gonna be our first culinary episode on
future cannabis project we're gonna make cannabis root wine.
Oh we can do like a parsnip, parsnip cannabis root vichyssoise, baked potato vichyssoise.
I've fresh juiced raw plant and root yeah done it doesn't taste too great but I'm sure it's healthy.
I would but back to the roots thing I would think that a pressure washer you know set on a low
setting with a wide spray would probably do a really good job of getting roots off you know
if it was something you know that you can use for yeah you can use it for other things too.
It's easy to clean it's just like a carrot I mean you're not using the very finest of the roots
you're gonna be using the largest thickest roots out of there they're gonna clean off pretty easy.
A carrot or a radish.
A pressure washer is so much more fun.
I think it's the it's the it's the depending on the medium like I'm in cocoa and perlite and vermiculite so like those root hairs get fucking in there man and it's just like they get tangled and they get very hard to get out so it's just like the brush
works relatively well I take away a lot of other stuff but I'm also running into things like I have
like 50 different plants that are very very small and growing and actually in in the top of the root
system with it so I got like take off all the cover crop and then clean the root so it's just like it
just yeah it's a lot of fucking horse shit but Matt you look like you want to say something.
Oh yeah I'm just gonna say I mean I get what Cheddar Bob is kind of saying like it is a
it does make sense I mean I throw my hands in because I run living soil beds and I kind of like
scoop up what I kind of think I can of like the most the mass and then I'll just kind of flip it
upside down and like break off as much dirt as I can and then I'll just hose or you know use a hose or
you know like a strong like kitchen sink like sprayer and go to town on them but I can see what
Cheddar Bob is saying though where like it might I mean it might work but there I think there might
be a possibility of you like searing them or like cutting them if you're using a pressure washer
because they're still kind of you know like a malleable if you will or like not mushy but
they're not you know I don't know but if somebody would make something like this I think it would
sell I think people would buy it especially for root crops in general. Just grow them hydroponically
and you don't have to worry about any of that mess. Oh there you go yeah that's exactly it and I wonder
well I wonder even like because I wish Ashley was here because there's an interesting point is that
the aeroponics they have like a very powerful root system but it's not as huge as they regularly get
they're a lot thicker and a lot more stouty so I wonder what like kind of that would that would
come out as and be easier to harvest now there's a lot of issue with commercial like I think
there's a whole fucked up problem here because we we a we don't utilize all the parts of the
plant because our system's all fucked up is not set up in quite the right way to be able to utilize
all the things also we're making it legal in this painfully slow way like we should be able we should
be using the stems for fiber we should be using the roots we should be using every part of the
plant in every way shape or form but we should also be doing this in every part of our other
cultures I think there's a point here that we always touch on that's kind of a background
background note of everything when we talk about regenerative when we talk about Korean natural
farming when we talk about all the things that make the best outcome for horticulture for growing
for creating the best plant whether it be lettuce tomatoes cilantro freaking like it's just flowers
for ornamentally when it comes to the to the best stuff for a what we're going to take into our body
but also what we're going to surround ourselves with it's about that that higher volume of
diversity and I was having conversation with Nick the other night from rooted leaf organics and
there's this mono thought that we do and what we we end up taking these things and like when
when it seeds when a plant seeds out just as a point of example when a plant seeds out and it
gathers up all these things these little bundles there's there's a lot of plants that have a lot
of methods of dispersing their seeds over long distances but a lot of plants don't have a lot
of seed dispersal it's actually they'll drop a few thousand into a small space and then you have a
diverse assortment of plants that are also dropping seeds into a small space so how often or how often
do you see ever in the world naturally or even in general in a lot of farm settings that a single
seed planted in a four by four bed it's just it it's what we've done over time to these plants
and done that and I wonder what we're losing in the scent like when you drop a bunch of seed a
mixed amount of seeds down like I have a cover crop that has like 50 or 60 different things in it
not everything survives a lot dies a lot doesn't succeed usually sometimes clover takes over as
the balance but usually there's a fair bit of diversity that does take hold and I think it's
that this diversity in key like the breakdown of these plants there was a question about what part
of the roots of a plant breakdown and what nutrient they have everything that a plant needs to grow
roots is in the root when it decomposes into soil after it's broken down so these all of these
components these acids that we know like that like um uh there's the lab it's got a name like lavender
an acid that the plant uses as signaling for when it's being attacked and and these acids can
actually like even though there's a single version form of it that you could probably buy in the
bottle actually come in a highly diverse portfolio like depending on where that acid got broken down
from it will be slightly different it will be affected from this other plant like juniper grown
with this or that is going to eventually be made up of these things so when we take these singular
items and cut them down into their you know I think it's 17 um what we consider these 17 critical
things which I critical things for plant growth which I believe didn't even originally include
silica um which still isn't really actually 100 necessarily although there's there's so much around
that you don't have to worry about it um it's it's it creates this monoway this this unhealthiness
this lack of backup responses to health to our plant health to our health to what we're
interacting with in the space and I think it creates a lot of other issues in itself
and I don't know if that got a little weird and philosophical there um but I I'm thinking it might
not be a terrible point to close that at two hours and a half unless somebody has anything else they
want to bring up or a comment that they want to say in response cool I think that worked out very
well well I'm going to say thank you Sarah for that amazing and and last question thanks for
CB for coming up thank you Connor and congratulations Eric it's always wonderful
Mr Toad, Evian thank you, Matt, Johnny, unfortunately Dr Anubis had to go and Cheddar Bob it's always

the lead person on the top left today so do we have permission to finish this afternoon?
I will grant you permission this one time to leave my presence London yes
Jendo tomorrow night Joda yeah Joda Herb that is actually and and who was it again that's coming in?
Jendo she's a hasher she's the hash maker yep from Maine do you know her?
area no no she lives in Maine but I don't know her we're pretty and I'm you know if I don't know her
you know it's pretty good chance she's not from Maine but you know did you did you have something
there though? Well I was just telling her she's jendohendrix420 on Instagram she's the US hash
queen and is filled with everything well the law have of Cheddar Bob has spoken so we shall shut
down the room make sure to follow the club follow the moderators and the speakers or Sarah because
she's clearly on the path that I want to be part of come back next week come back every week come
back and visit and join us at future cannabis project check out on on the thing in the what's
that and the and the insta poops and stuff like that we appreciate you all I'll leave the the
clubhouse room open for just a moment so you guys can make sure to follow everybody even if you're
in if you're in the audience and you sat here for two and a half hours you should probably follow
that other person that sat in this for two and a half hours because guess what y'all hung out
together on this little journey so I think y'all should be friends too so I'm gonna leave it open
for a second widen the belter no I'm gonna leave it open for
a second
and the law of Cheddar Bob has spoken yes Cheddar
you give Cheddar Bob and am I can you hear me you can hear me I'm not muted congratulations
thank you guys thanks everybody thank you to the cool awesome group I got no power and I'm
gonna shut this off the room there I hope you're all doing very very well we have some fun things
coming up uh the lemon tree that is invented the tops oh my god Eric I am so sorry but it's been
two and a half hours unfortunately the top of the leaves tops are flipping the leaves upside down
they're tall cultivars in the tent your your plant my guess Eric and I'm just gonna do this real quick
without ad for it you get too much into it is your plants too hot and too close to the light
it's turning its leaves away to avoid the heat and not die it's trying to stop respiration of
the plant um so I would try and like the decrease I much love we respect everybody Don uh PJ call
everybody that was there everybody that was in the room make sure to check out the car the the
the thing you know at uh yeah go too much uh you know at the you know the YouTube they have the
bio the description so there's some stuff in there to check out you should check out the
length of the people that are coming to this conversation and help move forward the group
every time um and bring everything forward that is also another potential problem there's never
like one answer Eric it's like there's so many potential avenues I hope you come back next week
and join us um for another conversation because what we're going to do is we're going to do it
every single week with all these fantastic people we're going to come back um and do that again so
every single Wednesday at five o'clock uh sorry four o'clock till about 5 30 maybe a little bit

it regularly don't forget to miss out on Jodah Herb not miss out on Jodah Herb tomorrow let me
know what's going on in the community let me know in the comments what you want to see us cover and
what you want to see on future cannabis project I have like a little thing that I'm working on
