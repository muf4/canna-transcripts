[00:01.600 --> 00:06.640]  All right, we're live. Hello everyone, welcome to the East Bay Seed Collective
[00:06.640 --> 00:19.480]  show. Yeah, Saturday morning, still waking up. Everybody's, see people on the chat
[00:19.480 --> 00:24.760]  but nobody on the watching yet. Okay, here we go.
[00:24.760 --> 00:35.400]  Yeah, welcome and we have some pretty cool stuff for today. One, my homie Isaac
[00:35.400 --> 00:39.640]  is coming on. We're gonna talk about the beginning of legalization in Washington.
[00:39.640 --> 00:47.360]  We talked about that before but we'll go into a bit more of that. Talk about some
[00:47.360 --> 00:54.520]  pretty cool gardens in Washington. Yeah, there's a lot of really interesting
[00:54.520 --> 00:58.360]  stuff going on in Washington, especially when it first got going. I thought there
[00:58.360 --> 01:02.920]  were some pretty cool gardens. I got a chance to travel the state of Washington
[01:02.920 --> 01:07.000]  with Isaac and check out some interesting gardens. There's one in
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.400]  particular that we saw which was an outdoor garden right outside of Spokane
[01:11.400 --> 01:19.960]  which was really stunning. The gardener was also an African-American
[01:19.960 --> 01:26.760]  which I was really digging. I mean he knew what he was doing. It was very
[01:26.760 --> 01:30.640]  apparent he had been growing in California for quite some time and when
[01:30.640 --> 01:37.680]  he moved to Washington, he just picked up where he left off. I'm pretty sure
[01:37.680 --> 01:44.720]  whatever he's doing these days, he's probably killing it as well. Yeah, I mean
[01:44.720 --> 01:47.640]  you know some people that you know once they have that skill it doesn't really
[01:47.640 --> 01:53.600]  matter where they go to. They're able to just succeed and excel.
[01:53.600 --> 01:58.240]  So yeah, you know we'll wait for my homie Isaac to come on. I know he works at
[01:58.240 --> 02:04.000]  night so he'll probably be coming on later. Also gonna do another cooking
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  section so that's pretty cool. Today we're gonna be making a mango lassi
[02:09.040 --> 02:18.040]  which is a traditional Indian drink and I think it's called a bang lassi is the
[02:18.040 --> 02:24.480]  one that's infused with cannabis. So we will be making a bang lassi today. I want
[02:24.480 --> 02:31.120]  to be honest, I'm not going to make an infused one this morning. It will wreck
[02:31.120 --> 02:36.760]  me if I make an infused one so I'm gonna you know go over all of the steps.
[02:36.760 --> 02:40.840]  I'll show you guys how to do it but you know instead of putting in the infused
[02:40.840 --> 02:45.520]  milk this morning, I'm gonna bitch out and just not have an infused drink this
[02:45.520 --> 02:50.320]  morning. I have harvesting to do today. I just have too much stuff to be high
[02:50.320 --> 02:57.600]  starting at 9 in the morning. But yeah that's that's what we're gonna do. I also
[02:57.600 --> 03:02.000]  have a really cool list of things to prepare for harvesting. We'll be talking
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.240]  about some harvesting stuff today. A lot of the stuff I'm assuming that most
[03:07.240 --> 03:15.040]  people already know but you know maybe you don't know some of the stuff. Maybe
[03:15.040 --> 03:19.640]  you know as we're talking about it you can share something with me that I don't
[03:19.640 --> 03:25.080]  know. But that's something that I'm you know definitely learning is that you
[03:25.080 --> 03:28.880]  know it's okay to talk about stuff that people already know. Like it doesn't have
[03:28.880 --> 03:33.400]  to be teaching them brand new things. You know we can just talk about stuff
[03:33.400 --> 03:36.520]  that people already know and you can kind of you know hone your skills even
[03:36.520 --> 03:41.760]  more, refine your skills. So that's kind of what we're gonna, that's kind of what
[03:41.760 --> 03:48.520]  we're doing today. I'll try to stop saying um so much and just get going. So
[03:48.520 --> 03:52.560]  I mean the first thing is you know we're harvesting now. Like we're really you
[03:52.560 --> 03:56.680]  know my show is a little bit more focused on outdoor people you know just
[03:56.680 --> 04:02.160]  because I'm an outdoor guy. We're harvesting right now. It's been you know for me a
[04:02.160 --> 04:10.160]  really good season. I really like to you know give credit to the weather and to
[04:10.160 --> 04:13.720]  you know into earth because I mean that's that's what makes it a good
[04:13.720 --> 04:19.080]  season is you know is the weather being consistent. Not being too hot, not being
[04:19.080 --> 04:25.440]  too cold. The bugs not you know coming on too crazy. But you know of course you
[04:25.440 --> 04:29.560]  know there are bugs. I did have issues and you know I would really say that for
[04:29.560 --> 04:34.040]  everybody like it's really important that every year you take note of where
[04:34.040 --> 04:37.680]  you you know where your shortcomings were the year before. And you'll probably
[04:37.680 --> 04:43.800]  hear me talk about the same things over and over again which is really for high
[04:43.800 --> 04:47.960]  grade outdoor cannabis you need to be able to finish the crop. And what does
[04:47.960 --> 04:52.640]  that mean by finish the crop? So right about this time of year when your plants
[04:52.640 --> 04:56.760]  are maybe almost finished, they're close to being finished, that's when the issues
[04:56.760 --> 05:02.080]  really start to compound. So whether that issue is powdered mildew or spider
[05:02.080 --> 05:08.440]  mites or you know just general unhealthy plants, pot size is not correct, plant not
[05:08.440 --> 05:13.440]  in the right location. At this time of the year all of those things are really
[05:13.440 --> 05:18.320]  going to be exploited and you know those plants are really going to you know
[05:18.320 --> 05:25.160]  they're stressed out and you know whatever your weakness is
[05:25.160 --> 05:29.400]  whatever you didn't focus on is going to be shown right now. So for example in my
[05:29.400 --> 05:33.520]  garden I have a few plants that have spider mites. So that just reaffirms I
[05:33.520 --> 05:37.040]  need to spray more. I also have a few plants that have a little bit of
[05:37.040 --> 05:39.880]  powdered mildew also coming in and that's the same thing it's really about
[05:39.880 --> 05:43.720]  spraying more. It's about you know pruning more, having your plants in the
[05:43.720 --> 05:49.320]  correct position. So I'll go into the correct positions. You want to make sure
[05:49.320 --> 05:53.720]  that your plants have enough air, you want to make sure that your plants have
[05:53.720 --> 05:58.200]  enough sunlight. And let's say if your plants don't have the optimal amount of
[05:58.200 --> 06:03.360]  sunlight or optimal amount of air circulation, you probably need to remove
[06:03.360 --> 06:08.480]  a lot of plant material. So remove some of the lower branches, remove the low
[06:08.640 --> 06:14.000]  larvae stuff, remove fan leaves. That will all really help with the air circulation
[06:14.000 --> 06:17.080]  so you can fight against the powder mildew. Also if your leaves are too
[06:17.080 --> 06:20.840]  bunched together when you spray it's really difficult to get full coverage
[06:20.840 --> 06:30.000]  for your plant. That being said, for me I don't like to remove a lot of lower
[06:30.000 --> 06:35.040]  stuff from my lower plant, from my outdoor plants. And in particular when
[06:35.040 --> 06:42.520]  they're more sativa, I really like to hold to keep as much material as
[06:42.520 --> 06:48.080]  possible. Well yeah I'll prune and let's say and you know in a veg. Once we go
[06:48.080 --> 06:54.240]  into flower I really like to keep a lot of that larvae, a lot of that bushy
[06:54.240 --> 07:00.680]  material. And the reason why is so that you can do multiple stages of harvesting.
[07:00.680 --> 07:05.960]  When you can do multiple stages of harvesting you're able to yield a lot
[07:05.960 --> 07:16.000]  lot more. You're also able to have let's say 70-80% of your plant for flowers and
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.720]  you can have like 20% to make some kind of extract or some kind of edible or try
[07:21.720 --> 07:26.720]  something new. You know make some kind of new extract or you know try something
[07:26.720 --> 07:29.720]  new with to make some kind of new products. I mean that's how the industry
[07:29.760 --> 07:37.680]  you know expands and changes. So yeah for me I don't like pulling too much of
[07:37.680 --> 07:42.640]  the lower stuff. I will pull some that's like close to the stem but in general
[07:42.640 --> 07:47.360]  you know for outdoor sativa plants I'll really leave that lower stuff. Another
[07:47.360 --> 07:54.640]  reason is it's called a harvest window. The harvest window for sativas is
[07:54.640 --> 07:58.320]  quite different than the harvest window for indica. So the harvest window for
[07:58.360 --> 08:05.280]  indica is my opinion is usually about two weeks. So like the tops start looking
[08:05.280 --> 08:13.560]  ready, it goes into peak harvest time, and then usually you have another week
[08:13.560 --> 08:18.320]  after that where it's like you know extra ripe. And then after that you know
[08:18.320 --> 08:23.320]  let's say two week window the plants really start to kind of degrade. They
[08:23.320 --> 08:27.200]  start to die. They start to go really downhill. And you'll notice that if you
[08:27.200 --> 08:33.520]  have a bunch of you know littles or larf it doesn't really fill out. Even if
[08:33.520 --> 08:40.920]  you harvest the tops and let some Sun go to those larfy littles, often they're
[08:40.920 --> 08:48.440]  already fairly developed but very tiny. And if you see bud sites that are very
[08:48.440 --> 08:52.520]  that are developed but tiny and so what we say that how do we know it's
[08:52.520 --> 08:58.360]  developed? Well it's developed because the trichomes are you know are ambering,
[08:58.360 --> 09:04.080]  the hairs are turning brown, but the bud sites are still small. That's not a good
[09:04.080 --> 09:08.120]  candidate for leaving the larfy stuff on the plant. I think we might have even
[09:08.120 --> 09:12.440]  talked about this last time. But if you have a sativa plant you'll notice that
[09:12.440 --> 09:18.120]  the larfy stuff will be immature. It will still have white hairs, the trichomes
[09:18.280 --> 09:25.120]  will not be amber. Those are really good candidates to let it keep ripening. So
[09:25.120 --> 09:31.200]  what we'll do is you know once your tops are nice and you know ready however ripe
[09:31.200 --> 09:35.020]  you would like them to be, you can harvest them and then you leave the
[09:35.020 --> 09:41.600]  lower stuff on the plant. And that stuff will then continue to harvest or
[09:41.600 --> 09:47.520]  continue to to ripen. What's pretty cool about that is you know let's say it
[09:47.600 --> 09:53.560]  rains. I love the rain when we have you know I take my top layers off and you
[09:53.560 --> 09:57.440]  know when you have rain because it actually cleans your buds. The buds are
[09:57.440 --> 10:04.920]  so tiny that you don't really get bud rot. So it cleans the buds, your plants
[10:04.920 --> 10:10.920]  get watered, and they really get a chance to ripen even more. And then you get a
[10:10.960 --> 10:18.800]  chance to really see the full spectrum of what that plant has to offer. Also you
[10:18.800 --> 10:23.480]  know often with that lower stuff it's even stronger because it you know those
[10:23.480 --> 10:28.000]  trichomes have you know like I said longer time to mature. It's great
[10:28.000 --> 10:35.200]  material to make hash out of and you know you just have more bud to work with.
[10:35.200 --> 10:41.400]  Also it really works nice as far as your timing because a lot of people
[10:41.400 --> 10:45.920]  don't have you know enough space to dry their outdoor which is a whole nother
[10:45.920 --> 10:53.360]  issue I'll get into. But you know you can harvest your tops, dry them, and then you
[10:53.360 --> 10:57.240]  can just basically let the lower stuff on your plant just go for another let's
[10:57.240 --> 11:04.520]  say month, three weeks, and you'll really be surprised and happy with what comes
[11:04.560 --> 11:10.960]  out of that. It also gives you a chance to kind of rest, focus on your tops, and
[11:10.960 --> 11:18.600]  you know move forward from there. So yeah that's kind of my... so for me
[11:18.600 --> 11:25.480]  you know when I'm growing indicas outside I'll prune them up fairly
[11:25.480 --> 11:29.360]  hard. I'll prune them up similar to maybe how I would prune like an out prune an
[11:29.480 --> 11:34.640]  indoor plant. You know prune up all the lowers, make sure that they have you know
[11:34.640 --> 11:40.360]  clean legs whatnot, and also you know pull off the you know fan leaves as well
[11:40.360 --> 11:44.160]  because you want that that air circulation. And you know it's another
[11:44.160 --> 11:47.440]  thing like I guess the same you know similar thing like removing the fan
[11:47.440 --> 11:56.360]  leaves for outdoor. If it's an indica plant I still will remove those fan
[11:56.400 --> 12:00.760]  leaves, and if it's a sativa I won't. And really the way that I
[12:01.520 --> 12:05.200]  make that decision whether those leaves will be removed or not is how wide
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.280]  they are. If the fan leaves are fairly wide then I'll remove them because
[12:11.560 --> 12:16.720]  it's blocking a lot of airflow, it's blocking light to the lower buds,
[12:17.440 --> 12:22.360]  and when you pull off those fan leaves you end up getting a lot
[12:22.360 --> 12:28.760]  more medium sized buds and less of like a really huge bud on the top and
[12:28.760 --> 12:33.040]  then it kind of tapers smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller down the
[12:33.040 --> 12:36.840]  stem, which is not really what you want. And the reason why you don't want
[12:36.840 --> 12:45.560]  that is one, those top buds get really prone to bud rot. And for me,
[12:46.040 --> 12:49.800]  and this happened from experience, the worst thing is when you have your
[12:49.800 --> 12:56.160]  head nug, you saving this head nug, and this person said what about
[12:56.160 --> 13:00.400]  hybrids, I'll get to that in a second. You're saving this head nug in your
[13:00.400 --> 13:04.440]  jar, you're so excited to smoke it and then one day you pop it open, you
[13:04.440 --> 13:08.160]  look in the middle and it's rotten. That to me is just such a
[13:08.160 --> 13:15.360]  disappointing feeling. And so yeah, I mean, that's why you pull those fan
[13:15.360 --> 13:20.160]  leaves, you pull the fan leaves, it makes it all even, one even size from
[13:20.160 --> 13:27.400]  the top to the bottom. Somebody said, what about hybrids? It depends on
[13:27.400 --> 13:33.320]  where the hybrid, where that pheno sits, right? I mean, if it's a hybrid
[13:33.320 --> 13:39.480]  that has thick old fan leaves, has really bushy, tight inner node spacing,
[13:39.480 --> 13:44.880]  then I'll thin it out. If you're also in an environment, let's say that's
[13:45.200 --> 13:51.400]  not an ideal amount of sun, not ideal amount of airflow, then I'll thin it
[13:51.400 --> 13:54.960]  out. Let's say you have a plant that you know is already prone to powder
[13:54.960 --> 13:59.760]  mildew, you've been battling powder mildew in the past, thin the plant out,
[13:59.760 --> 14:05.560]  pull off those fan leaves, prune off those lower buds. If you're in the
[14:05.560 --> 14:11.400]  opposite situation, maybe you don't have to thin out those fan leaves. But in
[14:11.480 --> 14:17.440]  general, if it's a plant that has big fan leaves, if the nodes stack really
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.040]  close to the stem, you want those, you want to have more space.
[14:22.440 --> 14:25.640]  If you're at the opposite situation, if you have a plant that has a
[14:25.640 --> 14:31.560]  nice stretch on it, fan leaves are fairly thin, then you don't need to
[14:31.560 --> 14:35.360]  prune off as much of that lower stem. So I'll give you an example.
[14:35.360 --> 14:37.360]  So for example, I'm growing some sour diesel.
[14:38.360 --> 14:46.160]  Sour diesel has fairly thin fan leaves. The buds can definitely stack,
[14:46.160 --> 14:52.880]  but still it's not too bushy. I'm not gonna prune that one up terribly
[14:52.880 --> 15:03.480]  hard. Let's say it's some kind of cookies varieties or... I don't know,
[15:03.520 --> 15:07.720]  I was growing some soap, which is like a sherb hybrid or something,
[15:09.360 --> 15:12.720]  something like that. I'll definitely prune up some of those lower buds,
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.360]  or I grew some bubblegum. Definitely, you'd want to prune up some of
[15:17.360 --> 15:23.000]  that lower stuff. Also, every single time that you grow... I'm saying the
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.520]  same thing. You take notes, you really wanna take notes to each year
[15:26.520 --> 15:33.120]  what your drawbacks are, because that last week, that last two weeks
[15:33.160 --> 15:35.560]  is really what brings the weed from
[15:39.400 --> 15:43.480]  one level to the next. So very often people who... So I have
[15:43.480 --> 15:49.840]  some homies who are beginning gardeners. This is their second, third year
[15:49.840 --> 15:52.960]  growing cannabis, and they harvest everything early. That's the
[15:54.400 --> 15:57.680]  very common rookie mistake, people harvest their stuff early.
[15:58.280 --> 16:05.000]  And... But they left some of the lowers and some of the mids,
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.160]  so he's able to
[16:07.800 --> 16:11.280]  let the mids go. And then once the mids and the lowers go,
[16:11.600 --> 16:15.120]  that stuff will be a little bit more high grade. Now,
[16:15.720 --> 16:19.440]  for somebody like me, who's been doing this almost 20 years or something,
[16:20.240 --> 16:24.440]  I'm able to see, okay, if I can let this plant go another week,
[16:24.760 --> 16:27.640]  it's gonna be that much better, it's gonna be that much stronger,
[16:28.160 --> 16:32.840]  and it's gonna be denser, and that's really going to be the difference
[16:32.840 --> 16:36.880]  and have that plant stand out. But for that plant to be able
[16:36.880 --> 16:39.840]  to be healthy enough to live that extra week,
[16:40.880 --> 16:44.760]  you have to have addressed those issues a month ago.
[16:45.480 --> 16:48.400]  And those issues are powder mildew and spider mites.
[16:49.240 --> 16:53.560]  So basically, I have to go back in time, time travel
[16:54.120 --> 16:57.080]  a month from now, and instead of being lazy,
[16:58.480 --> 17:03.720]  I needed to spray more on my plants. And that's really what it
[17:03.720 --> 17:08.960]  comes down to, is having those plants in optimal health so that
[17:09.600 --> 17:13.560]  when they're coming down the finish line, it's the last week or two,
[17:14.680 --> 17:18.680]  the plant is healthy and can show its full potential.
[17:19.480 --> 17:22.280]  And when you are able to let it go that final time,
[17:22.280 --> 17:26.760]  you will be very pleased and impressed with
[17:29.040 --> 17:33.760]  what those trichomes are able to do with what is inside of that
[17:33.760 --> 17:39.920]  head, how that material is able to mature to this specific level.
[17:39.920 --> 17:44.680]  Because that is really the crux of outdoor, is that people say it's
[17:44.680 --> 17:47.960]  not as potent as indoor. And the reason, in my opinion,
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.040]  it's not as potent is because people don't let it go that full
[17:53.040 --> 17:57.520]  term and all the way to the end where it's completely finished.
[17:57.960 --> 18:02.720]  Once it's completely finished, in my opinion, then as far as potency,
[18:02.720 --> 18:07.800]  it's very comparable to certain outdoor, excuse me, certain indoor.
[18:10.200 --> 18:14.440]  And that's just super important, important concepts
[18:14.760 --> 18:19.040]  to... For everybody. In all reality,
[18:21.520 --> 18:26.800]  I mean, this is to me as well as to you. Shout out to the homie Dalton.
[18:27.800 --> 18:30.400]  One of my homies gave me some Dr. Zyme. He was like,
[18:30.400 --> 18:33.560]  I'm seeing some powder mildew on your stuff. I'd love to give you this Dr.
[18:33.560 --> 18:36.160]  Zyme, see if it's gonna help fight the powder mildew.
[18:37.600 --> 18:40.800]  So sprayed some Dr. Zymes this morning.
[18:40.960 --> 18:45.560]  I'll go into a few products that I think work really well for
[18:45.560 --> 18:48.560]  fighting powder mildew, some things that work really well for right at the
[18:48.560 --> 18:52.720]  end of flower. So of course, Dr. Zymes is one.
[18:54.360 --> 18:57.920]  I'm a little skeptical just because
[19:00.320 --> 19:02.320]  I find things that work for me and I stick with them.
[19:02.320 --> 19:04.920]  So I'm not gonna say it's not a good product. I know that people
[19:04.920 --> 19:07.840]  use it, but I just don't like moving on to other products.
[19:07.840 --> 19:10.760]  Moving on to other products, but this is what I'm trying right now.
[19:12.120 --> 19:18.480]  Pure Crop One. This is very common in rec, rec cannabis. It works for
[19:18.480 --> 19:20.240]  powder mildew, it works for spider mites.
[19:21.760 --> 19:24.040]  Great product. You can also use this towards the end.
[19:25.720 --> 19:31.280]  Plant Therapy. It's a cheaper version of Green Cleaner, which is...
[19:31.280 --> 19:35.960]  Here, let me close this. Cheaper version of Green Cleaner.
[19:36.760 --> 19:40.640]  Sorry, I have that bad glare. I apologize.
[19:41.840 --> 19:46.120]  Yeah, cheaper version of Green Cleaner. Great product. You can spray this
[19:46.120 --> 19:50.480]  the whole time. And again, this works for powder mildew and for spider
[19:50.480 --> 19:53.960]  mites and for broad mites. These products
[19:56.400 --> 19:59.840]  are very important that you spray them and that you use them properly
[20:01.000 --> 20:04.160]  so that you have... So that you don't have powder mildew and so
[20:04.160 --> 20:05.920]  that the plants can't finish.
[20:09.880 --> 20:15.400]  Yeah, I think that might be it regarding those things.
[20:16.160 --> 20:18.920]  Yeah, Purple Thumb says, I love Plant Therapy.
[20:20.680 --> 20:24.920]  These products are really good. They work really well.
[20:25.480 --> 20:29.640]  The last thing I would say as far as in this aspect is
[20:29.680 --> 20:35.040]  invest in a good sprayer. Invest in an atomizer, invest in
[20:35.840 --> 20:39.720]  whatever sprayer is appropriate for your environment and your size of your
[20:39.720 --> 20:45.320]  room, but really invest in a good sprayer. It's so important. And you
[20:45.320 --> 20:47.760]  wanna invest... And I think we talked about this last time.
[20:47.760 --> 20:51.200]  You wanna invest in a sprayer that has the right size reservoir
[20:51.880 --> 20:55.520]  or tank for the size of your space. So for example,
[20:55.520 --> 20:58.640]  if you have a four by four tent, you don't wanna fill up
[20:58.640 --> 21:01.760]  a gallon of concentrate every time you spray,
[21:02.440 --> 21:04.680]  because you're going to be wasting your spray,
[21:05.480 --> 21:08.360]  because you're not gonna use a gallon through a four by four tent.
[21:08.840 --> 21:11.760]  In a four by four tent, you might use a quarter a gallon,
[21:11.760 --> 21:17.420]  maybe a half gallon tops. But when you're getting into bigger spaces,
[21:17.420 --> 21:20.200]  yes, you need a gallon. You might need a backpack sprayer or whatever.
[21:20.480 --> 21:25.360]  But having a proper sprayer is important because that's what
[21:25.680 --> 21:31.760]  applies your pesticide or fungicide to your plant and gets it into every
[21:31.760 --> 21:37.480]  single crevice of your plant. That is super, super, super crucial.
[21:38.040 --> 21:41.440]  Also, and again, I'm saying this... I'm repeating the same things.
[21:42.040 --> 21:45.760]  You can use your sprayer to spray off your plants with water.
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.600]  You can also use your sprayer to spray off your plants with air.
[21:50.600 --> 21:55.320]  And those are great ways of attacking bugs on your plant
[21:56.960 --> 22:01.480]  when you're close to harvest and you're not available, you're not comfortable
[22:01.480 --> 22:04.000]  spraying anything onto the plants. You can use water,
[22:04.720 --> 22:07.960]  you can use air, knock the plants, knock the bugs off of the
[22:07.960 --> 22:11.040]  plant, make it just not the right environment for them.
[22:12.680 --> 22:16.320]  Interesting, actually really interesting, disgusting
[22:17.320 --> 22:21.160]  story. I was using my... I had a room... Oh my God.
[22:23.280 --> 22:28.560]  I had this room and it was really spider mite infested.
[22:29.440 --> 22:32.960]  Plants were a couple of days, maybe a week away from being finished
[22:33.520 --> 22:38.840]  and the spider mites started trapezing. If you guys know what trapezing is,
[22:38.840 --> 22:43.840]  when they literally start making webs from bud to bud and running across,
[22:43.880 --> 22:48.520]  it looks like a trapeze across the different buds. And we were blowing
[22:48.520 --> 22:52.600]  off the spider mites, so we were just using the atomizer just to
[22:52.680 --> 22:57.400]  physically blow them off of the plants. And they eventually started making
[22:57.400 --> 23:03.040]  this waxy protective layer to protect from the wind.
[23:03.880 --> 23:08.160]  It was... Oh, it was disgusting.
[23:08.360 --> 23:14.840]  It gives me the creepy crawlies. But yeah, in general,
[23:17.120 --> 23:22.200]  yeah, you have to spray those. Somebody's saying the bud worms suck.
[23:23.960 --> 23:26.280]  So yeah, there's two ways of addressing the bud worms.
[23:27.720 --> 23:30.800]  Basically, you're gonna spray with either spinosin or
[23:31.520 --> 23:35.600]  BT bacillus thuringiensis. And you can spray with both of those.
[23:35.720 --> 23:41.480]  Those will... Once the caterpillars eat those bacterias, they die.
[23:42.800 --> 23:45.200]  Now, initially... And again, this is things that we've talked about before,
[23:45.200 --> 23:47.600]  but I mean, a lot of these things need to be talked about
[23:47.600 --> 23:52.680]  multiple times. Usually, you would just need to spray a few times in
[23:52.680 --> 23:55.520]  August when your plants go into transition, you can spray.
[23:57.400 --> 24:01.040]  And then that's pretty much it as the trichomes came onto the plants,
[24:01.360 --> 24:04.960]  but the worms weren't really able to get in there because those trichomes
[24:05.280 --> 24:09.040]  protected them. So whichever worms were inside were in, but whatever ones
[24:09.040 --> 24:12.440]  were on the outside weren't really able to get in. But what we've been
[24:12.440 --> 24:15.440]  noticing in the past few years, and in particularly this year,
[24:15.440 --> 24:19.280]  is that they were able to get in and they have been eating
[24:19.320 --> 24:24.160]  through the trichomes. And they've been continuously coming onto the plants
[24:24.160 --> 24:28.560]  and there have been... The cabbage moth continuously laying eggs
[24:29.560 --> 24:32.600]  throughout the whole time, so still laying eggs. And
[24:33.600 --> 24:38.840]  in that situation, you literally have to continuously spray with those products.
[24:41.360 --> 24:45.400]  So yes, no... Spinosin is not good for bees, so then it would
[24:45.400 --> 24:51.840]  basically just be Bt, Bacterialis thuringiensis. And
[24:54.920 --> 24:57.840]  I guess the other options is you can also use predator...
[24:58.960 --> 25:02.400]  What are they? Caterpillar parasites you can also use.
[25:02.920 --> 25:05.680]  And you can also use netting. And
[25:06.760 --> 25:09.840]  those, I guess, are the three options. So the one option would be
[25:10.320 --> 25:14.560]  bacterial, which would be Bt. The other one would be
[25:16.040 --> 25:20.960]  another bug, which would be predatory... What are they? Predatory wasps,
[25:20.960 --> 25:26.040]  I think they use. And then the last one would be a physical
[25:26.040 --> 25:30.960]  barrier, which would be some kind of netting. And those are the three
[25:30.960 --> 25:37.840]  options. But now you have to... Whatever option you use, you'd have to
[25:37.840 --> 25:42.080]  use it very close to the whole time. If you only spray the
[25:42.080 --> 25:45.240]  beginning and then let your plants ride, you're going to get a lot
[25:45.240 --> 25:49.760]  of caterpillar damage. Also to keep in mind, certain plants
[25:50.800 --> 25:54.360]  fight off caterpillar damage much, much better than others.
[25:55.840 --> 25:59.480]  And it kind of goes back into the same Indica sativa
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.800]  dynamic. Your Indicas do not fight off that damage as well.
[26:04.800 --> 26:06.680]  The reason why is because if you have,
[26:07.640 --> 26:12.080]  let's say, some bud rot, for one, the caterpillar is really protected and
[26:12.080 --> 26:15.400]  it kind of sits around the stem and it'll munch on the stem,
[26:16.960 --> 26:20.040]  start shitting, keep going around in circles around your bud.
[26:21.240 --> 26:25.560]  And it's really protected. It's hard to see, unless there's the damage,
[26:25.560 --> 26:29.840]  you can't see that caterpillar. If you spray that bud, it's not really
[26:29.880 --> 26:34.200]  gonna get inside of the bud. Even, let's say, if you have some
[26:34.560 --> 26:39.040]  predatory wasps or some kind of caterpillar predators,
[26:39.760 --> 26:43.520]  they can't physically get into that bud. On the other hand,
[26:43.520 --> 26:47.960]  if you have some sort of sativa varieties, the buds are a lot
[26:47.960 --> 26:51.760]  more open, there's less protection for those caterpillars.
[26:52.600 --> 26:57.160]  Also, if you have one bud site, the caterpillar munches on and it
[26:57.200 --> 27:02.640]  dies, it doesn't really spread. What happens is that one
[27:03.560 --> 27:08.160]  site ends up drying out and dying, and you can identify it.
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.760]  On an Indica, often it doesn't actually dry out. It starts to die,
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.800]  but it's still moist because it's sandwiched between
[27:17.680 --> 27:20.800]  other buds on both sides of it that are alive. And so what
[27:20.800 --> 27:24.640]  happens is that rot ends up really spreading to the whole thing,
[27:24.640 --> 27:25.800]  instead of just being
[27:27.360 --> 27:33.440]  located in one little spot. Also, what I've noticed is that...
[27:33.440 --> 27:36.360]  So my art, I'm sure a lot of other of you guys also
[27:36.360 --> 27:38.840]  have that, is we have a lot of wasps now.
[27:39.480 --> 27:43.440]  And what I've noticed is that my wasps have really been just
[27:44.720 --> 27:49.800]  patrolling my plants. They've been patrolling hardcore, and
[27:50.440 --> 27:54.000]  when they patrol my sativa plants, they're really able to get in there.
[27:54.280 --> 27:57.480]  My theory is that... Hey, good morning Indiva.
[27:59.480 --> 28:03.960]  My theory is that the wasps are eating a lot of the caterpillars,
[28:04.760 --> 28:11.320]  and I like that. I was actually harvesting some plants yesterday at a
[28:11.320 --> 28:15.680]  different location, and the wasps were getting pissed, because I was messing
[28:15.680 --> 28:16.720]  with their food source.
[28:18.840 --> 28:23.680]  That was kind of weird, and I've had that experience before of harvesting
[28:23.680 --> 28:29.600]  and being chased by wasps. It's not an enjoyable, very zen harvesting experience,
[28:30.480 --> 28:34.880]  but at the same time, I do think that that's a reason why I'm
[28:34.880 --> 28:37.800]  not getting as much caterpillar damage as a lot of people that I'm
[28:37.800 --> 28:39.840]  hearing, is because I think those wasps are killing them.
[28:40.560 --> 28:47.720]  So once again, for caterpillar damage, the sativa really wins, and the
[28:47.760 --> 28:49.240]  same thing for
[28:52.120 --> 28:57.960]  the sativa type structured plants. Same thing for pruning. Those sativa
[28:58.520 --> 29:00.760]  structured plants, they really win.
[29:04.840 --> 29:08.320]  Gosh, what was I? I just... Ah, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:08.320 --> 29:08.760]  Okay.
[29:10.080 --> 29:13.760]  So yeah, we went into bugs. So now we're gonna go into some
[29:13.760 --> 29:16.320]  outdoor harvesting, and
[29:18.720 --> 29:21.200]  I guess a lot of today is this kind of like this,
[29:21.840 --> 29:25.760]  how can we attract predatory wasp and flies?
[29:29.600 --> 29:33.440]  I mean, I would just say having native plants on your land.
[29:33.440 --> 29:37.840]  I mean, for me, I feel like the reason they're attracted is because
[29:38.240 --> 29:42.640]  where I live, it's so dry that they're attracted to my plants because
[29:42.640 --> 29:44.720]  they're healthy, because there's water around.
[29:44.720 --> 29:47.760]  I think that's really all that it comes down to is just having an
[29:47.760 --> 29:54.880]  oasis for having native plants, having water in your area, having
[29:55.280 --> 29:58.800]  healthy plants that are around, and you'll get predators, you'll get
[29:58.800 --> 29:59.360]  whatever...
[30:01.840 --> 30:06.480]  Yeah, you'll get life coming to your area, because where I live in
[30:06.480 --> 30:10.480]  California, it's mad dry, so there's just not a lot of
[30:10.640 --> 30:15.600]  dryness. So in my yard, it's moist, it's fertile, things go over there,
[30:15.600 --> 30:16.720]  so that really helps.
[30:17.920 --> 30:21.840]  So we're gonna go into harvesting of buds, and
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.720]  this is just kind of one of my biggest pet peeves that just irks me so
[30:28.720 --> 30:36.240]  much, is when you harvest your indicas, very, very often, you know,
[30:36.320 --> 30:40.560]  outdoors have these killer plants, they cut them down, everything is
[30:40.560 --> 30:48.720]  looking nice, they hang it, and then they look, and a week later,
[30:50.160 --> 30:51.680]  at least half the bud is rotten.
[30:52.880 --> 30:55.600]  You know, the big cola, and you look, and it's just like,
[30:56.160 --> 30:58.240]  boom, in the middle, it's just rot.
[30:59.920 --> 31:03.600]  And that is just one of the biggest pet peeves that I have.
[31:03.680 --> 31:04.240]  It's just rot.
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.880]  And that just crushes my heart.
[31:10.800 --> 31:14.640]  It's just unnecessary, and then people blame the breeder, people blame the
[31:14.640 --> 31:18.880]  genetics, you know, there's blame all around.
[31:18.880 --> 31:19.440]  And,
[31:21.920 --> 31:26.480]  I mean, in reality, it's your own fault, like, really what you need to do,
[31:26.480 --> 31:30.560]  and so I'll go into this. When you harvest indica plants outdoors, you
[31:30.560 --> 31:32.560]  have to cut them up into a bunch of little pieces.
[31:33.120 --> 31:38.960]  That's just, that's how it goes. It's very important if you want to save that
[31:38.960 --> 31:46.080]  bud, you have to just chop it up into a many pieces. Yeah, blame fixes, yeah,
[31:46.080 --> 31:48.960]  I mean, blame fixes nothing, you just have to move on. And obviously, the
[31:48.960 --> 31:51.520]  reason why I'm telling you this is because I've had this experience
[31:52.080 --> 31:57.280]  multiple times. It's just often people have this experience and then never
[31:57.280 --> 32:05.360]  able to make the, make an action move to address it. So the action move is
[32:05.360 --> 32:10.080]  to cut those buds up into a million little pieces. And sometimes it seems
[32:10.080 --> 32:14.800]  counterintuitive because you are cutting it up, like it doesn't, the bud won't
[32:14.800 --> 32:20.080]  look as nice. So you literally, you take your fat cola that's just like, boom,
[32:20.640 --> 32:24.400]  and you just start chopping it into pieces and chop it, chop it, chop it,
[32:24.400 --> 32:28.400]  chop it, chop it. And you can't hang those buds. You have to like put it on
[32:28.400 --> 32:33.120]  like a paper plate or something so that hopefully there's airflow from under it.
[32:33.120 --> 32:37.280]  But you chop that bud up into like as many little pieces as you can. And
[32:37.280 --> 32:42.080]  that's how you help it dry properly so it doesn't get rot. As you're chopping
[32:42.080 --> 32:45.600]  it, you might notice there'll probably be a little piece of bud rot in the
[32:45.600 --> 32:52.240]  middle of that bud. Remove that. And that, that little bud rot piece could
[32:52.240 --> 32:59.360]  have spread to the whole thing. So, so yeah, you take those, you know, those
[32:59.360 --> 33:02.960]  indica pieces and you just cut it up into as many pieces as you can. You put
[33:02.960 --> 33:08.000]  it on a plate, flip it on to like a saucer upside down or whatever, just so
[33:08.000 --> 33:11.840]  you get that airflow. And so those pieces can dry as quickly as possible.
[33:13.440 --> 33:20.400]  That's how you harvest indica plants, outdoor indica plants. That's just how,
[33:20.400 --> 33:26.640]  how you need to do it to keep those buds from rotting. And shoot, I mean,
[33:26.640 --> 33:31.760]  let's say you last year had a lot of rot. Then you can do that with your
[33:31.760 --> 33:35.040]  hybrids too. I mean, you can do that with your sativas. You can really do that
[33:35.040 --> 33:42.880]  with any plant. That will help keep it not moldy. And that will help you be
[33:42.880 --> 33:47.920]  able to, I call it like landing, like if you're fishing, like you have the fish
[33:48.000 --> 33:54.640]  on, but you still need to get it onto the boat. And to get these buds onto the
[33:54.640 --> 33:59.440]  boat, you need to cut them up in little pieces and let them really dry in the,
[33:59.440 --> 34:03.520]  you know, let them dry. What is, what is Indiva saying? Can still hang after
[34:03.520 --> 34:09.040]  a trip. Just, yeah. Just got to do it correctly. Do not handle your, yeah.
[34:09.600 --> 34:14.880]  Yeah. Don't manhandle your ladies. And I mean, this goes into another thing that
[34:14.880 --> 34:19.520]  Indiva is talking about, which is, I mean, it's a really great point, which is
[34:19.520 --> 34:28.000]  essentially the, you know, the, the quality of your bud at this point really
[34:28.000 --> 34:37.840]  depends on how you're handling your material and how gently, how, yeah, how
[34:37.840 --> 34:41.360]  gently you're handling and not getting those trichomes knocked off. Now also
[34:41.360 --> 34:46.320]  keep in mind, like when you're working pounds and pounds and pounds, it's
[34:46.320 --> 34:53.280]  difficult to hold every single branch by the stem and hang it in this perfect
[34:53.280 --> 34:58.320]  little way and not have there be any friction between the buds. And all of
[34:58.320 --> 35:05.440]  those things are difficult when you're harvest to scale. Yeah. If it's one
[35:05.440 --> 35:11.200]  plant or a small, you know, a little tent and you have the whole day to do it,
[35:11.200 --> 35:17.280]  it's different than if you have two hours to cut down three plants that are in 60
[35:17.280 --> 35:23.200]  gallon pots. It's just different, you know, different levels of scale, whether
[35:23.200 --> 35:28.080]  it's quantity or quality, they're all different things. And what I mean, what
[35:28.080 --> 35:31.680]  Indiva is saying is completely correct. I mean, he's a hash maker. So like he's,
[35:31.760 --> 35:39.760]  he'll see those things, how it was handled. Extremely important. Extremely,
[35:39.760 --> 35:43.680]  extremely important. And then we'll, so let's go, go back to that. So we're
[35:43.680 --> 35:48.480]  harvesting now. One of my buddies was kind of, we're talking about harvesting
[35:49.360 --> 35:53.680]  and, you know, like really like harvesting indoors, different from harvesting
[35:53.680 --> 35:59.440]  outdoor. Harvesting, we won't really get into harvesting out indoor, but
[35:59.440 --> 36:04.160]  harvesting outdoor is different. Harvesting outdoor goes into basically two
[36:04.160 --> 36:10.080]  sections. One is harvesting. The second part is trimming for harvesting for
[36:10.080 --> 36:16.480]  outdoor. The most important thing, in my opinion, is for your material to be dry
[36:16.480 --> 36:23.920]  first. Now let's say for indoor, it's more about you're slowly trying it. You're
[36:23.920 --> 36:32.560]  curing it. You have a little bit more control over what you're doing. For outdoor,
[36:33.920 --> 36:39.440]  it's about getting it dry. It might be a little bit too dry at first and that's okay
[36:40.000 --> 36:46.320]  because you have a lot of material and you don't want it to get rotten. So with your outdoor,
[36:47.200 --> 36:54.800]  you want to cut it down and let it dry and just get it to be dry and segregate all of your
[36:56.400 --> 37:01.040]  contaminated material. So any of your bud rot, powder mildew,
[37:04.160 --> 37:10.240]  you know, basically those things. You're just drying the material. Once the material is dry,
[37:10.240 --> 37:14.960]  then you're storing it in totes or in Tupperwares and letting it cure in there.
[37:15.920 --> 37:23.600]  And again, you're just holding it until it gets to homeostasis where it's like,
[37:24.160 --> 37:30.800]  it gets moist, it gets dry, it gets moist, it gets dry back and forth, but you just want it to dry
[37:30.800 --> 37:40.480]  and be okay so that you can then start trimming it later. And also this goes back to volume,
[37:40.880 --> 37:47.360]  because for outdoor, you usually have such a larger amount than for indoor. Now, of course,
[37:47.360 --> 37:53.600]  let's say if you're drying something for the Emerald Cup or for whatever, you're going to
[37:55.280 --> 38:02.480]  use climate controlled material. You're going to dry it the same way that you're going to dry your
[38:02.480 --> 38:08.400]  indoor. But in reality, people who grow outdoor often don't have the same facilities as people
[38:08.400 --> 38:14.080]  who grow indoor. Very often people who grow outdoor don't have space inside of their house
[38:14.080 --> 38:21.760]  with a room with an AC to dry their stuff as optimally as we would like. Most often people
[38:21.760 --> 38:29.520]  have like a garage or some funky space. Also very, very important, keep in mind that when
[38:29.520 --> 38:37.440]  you're drying in a tent, tents don't hold that much cannabis. Right now, I think I have a four
[38:37.440 --> 38:45.280]  by four tent. It might have maybe two plants that were in like 60 gallon pots that were like indica
[38:45.280 --> 38:55.120]  varieties, maybe two plants in there. And the tent is pretty packed. So you need to really think ahead
[38:55.840 --> 39:00.800]  where you're going to dry all this cannabis. It's the biggest rookie mistake for outdoor when people
[39:01.600 --> 39:07.280]  harvest their material and they're like, hey, what's up dog days? And they're like, I don't know
[39:07.280 --> 39:12.080]  where I'm going to dry this material. And I don't want to pick on people if that's their
[39:13.600 --> 39:17.520]  rookie mistake. That's not a problem, but it is a rookie mistake because that is the most,
[39:18.240 --> 39:22.800]  that is a very important aspect is having a location to dry. So let's say you have a location
[39:22.800 --> 39:28.160]  to dry, but it's not ideal. It's not as much space as you would like. Then what you want to do is you
[39:28.160 --> 39:32.320]  want to stagger your harvest. So what that means is let's say you harvest your tops,
[39:32.720 --> 39:36.800]  you wait a couple of days, they're going to shrink down. They're going to dry out a lot. Then you'll
[39:36.800 --> 39:43.040]  have more space in your tent. So what I'll do is I'll fill my tent up. I'll harvest a bunch of
[39:43.040 --> 39:49.760]  tops. The tops were ready. I harvested the pure cush and I harvested the triangle times chem D
[39:50.400 --> 39:56.640]  that Huey Jack selected and gave to me. Those triangle chem D was from humbled CSI. It was a
[39:57.600 --> 40:03.520]  great plant. So I harvested the tops. I think I harvested pretty much most of those two plants
[40:04.400 --> 40:13.040]  over the past week would harvest after four days material would shrink down. It would dry up. It's
[40:13.040 --> 40:18.720]  not fully dry, but it's pretty dry. So then I can then push the hangers down, put more material in
[40:18.800 --> 40:28.800]  there and so on. I have my Indica's. I think I had some Bubba. I was super stacked. Those are the
[40:28.800 --> 40:35.600]  ones that I cut into a bunch of pieces. I did not let them hang and I put them on the floor on a,
[40:36.480 --> 40:45.680]  what is that like some kind of like a rack that has some airflow. Also, if you guys are for drying,
[40:45.680 --> 40:50.320]  I would recommend using tomato cages. You can take the tomato cage, flip it upside down.
[40:50.320 --> 40:56.720]  You can hang your plants on that. So you have more of like a 3d drying space. And then the other
[40:56.720 --> 41:01.200]  thing which works really well is to take your caging. So let's say you're using caging to
[41:01.200 --> 41:06.720]  trellis up your plants. You can literally take that cage after you harvested the whole plant,
[41:06.720 --> 41:11.200]  put that cage inside of your room, inside of your grow tent or whatever. And then that gives you
[41:11.920 --> 41:20.800]  more 3d space to, to dry your outdoor plants. And it's, you know, it's super important to give those
[41:20.800 --> 41:30.880]  plants really as much space as possible to dry. I would even argue if you don't have enough space,
[41:31.600 --> 41:38.000]  there's two options. One don't harvest because if there's not enough space and you harvest it
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.560]  anyways, you're just going to end up ruining the material. So it's better just to let it
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.760]  become overdone and harvest it later. The other option is to freeze it and to make some sort of
[41:49.760 --> 41:56.400]  hash out of it. But those are really the only options. If you don't have the space, don't cut
[41:56.400 --> 42:02.000]  it down because you're, you're just going to be disappointed. It can spread to the other stuff
[42:02.000 --> 42:09.120]  that you're working on. And, you know, those are just not, you know, these are things I'm just
[42:09.120 --> 42:15.360]  telling you from my experience. Like, yeah, you know, it's just, just from experience. So,
[42:16.320 --> 42:21.840]  so I would really, let me, let me, so I'm gonna text my, let me see if my guest is coming on
[42:21.840 --> 42:27.040]  today. I'm going to text him real quick, but I think things that we're talking about today are
[42:27.040 --> 42:32.720]  super pertinent. Let me know in the chat, is this something you guys are into?
[42:39.250 --> 42:44.850]  Um, yeah, I mean, yeah, I think all of our guests will probably come on at maybe 15 at 10 o'clock.
[42:45.410 --> 42:51.730]  What is Nick saying? Because it allows the heads to fall off easier when you wash. Yeah.
[42:53.890 --> 42:57.090]  Um, so I'm just going to go over a list of harvesting materials.
[42:58.050 --> 43:05.890]  And please, like in the chat, if you're, if you're, uh, you know, in the chat, if you have
[43:05.890 --> 43:12.770]  something you want to chime in on, please. I'm just going to go over like the list of materials
[43:12.770 --> 43:21.010]  for, for harvesting. And yeah, we'll go from there. So gloves, you know, make sure you have gloves
[43:21.810 --> 43:25.890]  so that you can be clean so that everything in your house doesn't have trichomes on it.
[43:26.450 --> 43:31.890]  Also, in case you're going to go to the bathroom, you don't want to have, I mean, I'll say you don't
[43:31.890 --> 43:38.930]  want to have feces on your butts. And, you know, if your hands are sticky and you wipe your ass and
[43:40.690 --> 43:48.930]  wash your hands, I mean, it's, you know, sorry, I have to go there, but you know, it is an issue,
[43:48.930 --> 43:54.770]  you know, we don't want E. coli on our butts. So it's, it's, it's nice to wear gloves. It's just,
[43:54.850 --> 43:57.730]  I mean, think of it like cooking, you know, like if you're cooking for other people,
[43:57.730 --> 44:05.170]  you want to make sure your hands are clean as possible. Scissors, loppers, you know,
[44:05.170 --> 44:13.410]  have multiple types of scissors, have, I like chikamasas in particular for outdoor. I really
[44:13.410 --> 44:21.010]  like chikamasas. They actually have ones that are for men, men's hands and ones that are for
[44:21.010 --> 44:26.930]  women's hands. I really like the ones that have kind of like the harder orange and less of like
[44:26.930 --> 44:34.690]  the rounded one. It's kind of like a triangle. I really like those chikamasas. They're great.
[44:34.690 --> 44:39.810]  They're super quick and you know, it's the right tool for the job. And when you're spending,
[44:40.610 --> 44:45.730]  I don't know, 40, however many hours plus, it's important to have the right tools.
[44:45.730 --> 44:49.890]  Want to make sure you have some good loppers too, because those will get your scissors dull. If
[44:49.890 --> 44:58.050]  you're using your trimming scissors to cut thick branches, you want to make sure you have tape
[44:58.690 --> 45:04.610]  and markers so that you can mark all your branches. I'm notorious for not marking all my branches,
[45:04.610 --> 45:10.690]  so I'll own up myself. Make sure that you really mark everything multiple times to,
[45:11.890 --> 45:17.090]  oh, and then Indiva is another question. Yeah. Don't use the same scissors to take clones as you
[45:17.090 --> 45:23.490]  do to trim your buds. I'll be honest, the scissors that I use to take clones are the scissors that I
[45:23.490 --> 45:30.050]  use to cook food. So they aren't really plant scissors. I don't really use plant scissors to
[45:30.050 --> 45:35.170]  take clones. I like to use the scissors that are just in my cooking cabinet, because I know that
[45:35.170 --> 45:43.810]  those don't have the same type of bacterias all around them. Markers, tomato cages, oil.
[45:43.810 --> 45:49.330]  So here's another thing. Back in the day, some of my hippie friends, they would love to take
[45:49.330 --> 45:56.130]  our organic oil, our organic cooking olive oil, and rub it all over their hands to get their
[45:56.130 --> 46:05.490]  hands nice and smooth and get all the THC off of their hands. Just don't use your friend's
[46:05.490 --> 46:10.690]  expensive organic oil or whatever. I mean, use whatever oil you want, but have some oil for
[46:10.690 --> 46:16.370]  people. Some people like to dip their scissors in oil because it keeps them smooth. Some people
[46:16.370 --> 46:23.570]  like to have their scissors sitting in alcohol. My own pet peeve, I hate it when people have my
[46:23.570 --> 46:29.570]  scissors sitting in alcohol and people are trimming for me. I don't know why, but I just do not,
[46:30.770 --> 46:36.370]  I don't like that. I really prefer people just to take a blade and, you know, slice them,
[46:36.370 --> 46:41.170]  dip it once and then wipe it off. But honestly, if you can get your friends to trim for you,
[46:42.130 --> 46:46.450]  then God bless them, because if not, you're going to do that shit by yourself.
[46:47.570 --> 46:53.810]  Next goes into music. When you're trimming, I mean, I guess this is silly, but you know,
[46:53.810 --> 47:00.450]  make sure you have some good music on. And, you know, when back in the medical days, we were
[47:00.930 --> 47:09.010]  doing this a lot, trimming a lot, you know, like moving cannabis, whatever, growing cannabis.
[47:12.370 --> 47:17.570]  I like to use techno music and I like to use stuff with a high BPM because you really want people to
[47:17.570 --> 47:23.410]  keep cutting to the beat. So you don't want things that are too slow. You don't want people to be
[47:23.410 --> 47:30.770]  looking up. You want people just to just be just cutting along and moving at a nice pace. That's
[47:30.770 --> 47:36.610]  super, super important. And then the next thing goes into is trimming content. Besides music,
[47:36.610 --> 47:42.050]  you also want to have like, you know, movies and whatever. And the most, the best thing for people
[47:42.050 --> 47:49.410]  to listen to is comedy and no techno for me, this person said. Yeah, I mean, it's whatever, you know,
[47:49.410 --> 47:54.450]  whatever you like for sure. Because, you know, techno is one of those things in EDM people either
[47:54.450 --> 48:00.210]  like it or they hate it. But, you know, comedy is great because you don't want people to look up.
[48:00.210 --> 48:04.370]  You don't want it to be a movie where people are trimming and they're looking up and looking down.
[48:04.370 --> 48:09.650]  You want it to be something where people are looking at the buds, they can hear it. It's funny.
[48:11.010 --> 48:16.530]  And they keep going. And, you know, it keeps them stimulated because you want people to be
[48:16.530 --> 48:23.090]  stimulated. You don't want people to be going kind of down and getting tired and slow. You want
[48:23.090 --> 48:30.690]  them to be kind of up and keep moving with that motion. So I really like, I really like like Eddie
[48:30.690 --> 48:36.610]  Murphy comedies and like stuff from back in the day. It's super funny and it just keeps you trimming
[48:36.610 --> 48:42.450]  and you don't have to look. Also, maybe if it's a movie you've seen a million times, those kind of
[48:42.450 --> 48:45.810]  things are cool too because you know it in your head. You can't have something that you have to
[48:45.810 --> 48:54.530]  look up. It has to be something that's in your head. So we went into soap already. This is a
[48:54.530 --> 49:04.050]  really cool product. Scissor cleaner. Big up to Medilux on IG who told me about this. It's like
[49:05.890 --> 49:09.970]  acetone or something like that. Like this sponge and you just kind of like put your,
[49:10.530 --> 49:16.610]  you just kind of put your scissors in there and it cleans them off really nice. I actually spilled
[49:16.610 --> 49:21.330]  some of this stuff on my computer when I was showing it to you. But yeah, I think it's like
[49:21.330 --> 49:26.130]  acetone or something like that. And it just cleans the scissors really nice. You can rub them on the
[49:26.130 --> 49:32.450]  edges and it keeps them clean. And I mean, in reality, you need multiple aspects of, you know,
[49:32.450 --> 49:37.090]  keeping all of your stuff clean. Like it's not just one way. You need a bunch of different things to
[49:37.490 --> 49:44.450]  to keep your material clean. It's a big leaf or not. We already went into that. Harvesting Indica's
[49:44.450 --> 49:50.690]  carbon filters. Once again, I mean, I would assume that most people do know what a carbon filter is,
[49:50.690 --> 49:56.690]  but you know, it's important to not assume, to not assume. And so like the carbon filter is this
[49:56.690 --> 50:03.330]  great advice, this great device that people use now so that your areas don't smell like cannabis
[50:04.050 --> 50:14.130]  so hard. And you can buy carbon filters any size from like, I don't know, like about here to five,
[50:14.130 --> 50:19.170]  six feet in size. I don't know. I think the biggest one I've seen was maybe like six,
[50:20.130 --> 50:27.250]  six foot or so, five or six feet. Anybody ever in here seen a bigger carbon filter, bigger than five
[50:27.250 --> 50:33.650]  or six feet? I would love to know if you guys have ever seen one bigger than that, but definitely
[50:33.650 --> 50:42.690]  get a carbon filter. The carbon filter is rated for the cubic feet of the area that it's filtering.
[50:42.690 --> 50:50.530]  And they, you measure that by CFM, cubic feet per minute. And I believe every minute you want to
[50:50.530 --> 50:57.010]  clean the area of that whole space. So for example, if you have a garage, let's say that's
[50:58.050 --> 51:07.970]  3000 cubic feet and your carbon filter is rated for 700 cubic feet, that carbon filter is probably
[51:07.970 --> 51:17.330]  not going to clean the air for that size of a room. So that's why you want to figure out the cubic feet
[51:17.970 --> 51:27.250]  of your space that you are scrubbing the air of and then get a carbon filter that matches that
[51:27.250 --> 51:37.250]  cubic, that CFM. And then with that carbon filter, you also want to get a fan, which is an inline fan
[51:37.970 --> 51:45.490]  that matches the size of that carbon filter. That is extremely, extremely important. Carbon filters
[51:46.050 --> 51:51.970]  can be expensive and the same with fans. Those are two products that I would recommend looking
[51:51.970 --> 52:00.610]  on Craigslist. You can very often find very good fans on Craigslist and carbon filters,
[52:01.170 --> 52:05.890]  it's kind of hit and miss. And the reason for carbon filters is basically it's a huge piece.
[52:05.890 --> 52:13.810]  It's just huge. And people always end up having them stuck at their house. And so there's always
[52:13.890 --> 52:20.530]  people who are very willing to get rid of their carbon filters used. Here's the secret. Carbon
[52:20.530 --> 52:31.250]  filters, you can tell how good they are based on how much they weigh. Carbon filter starts to
[52:31.250 --> 52:40.530]  absorb the carbon. As the carbon absorbs moisture, it gets heavier. As it gets heavier, it works
[52:40.530 --> 52:44.930]  less well. If you're growing in a garage, make sure you don't open...
[52:46.930 --> 52:52.370]  Oh, bring it. Yeah. And if you're using a carbon filter, you might want to scrub the sides of it
[52:53.090 --> 53:01.410]  if you're buying a used one. But I would definitely say you get a new one, need to get new ones,
[53:01.410 --> 53:08.530]  and stop working. Carbon filters, I will say, some people say you need to get a new one.
[53:09.490 --> 53:17.890]  Personally, I've been using fairly old carbon filters when it's just for a scrubber. And what
[53:17.890 --> 53:27.410]  I mean for a scrubber is you're not using it, let's say, in your indoor grow room.
[53:29.090 --> 53:33.810]  If you have an indoor grow room and let's say you have four lights and you have your carbon filter
[53:33.970 --> 53:37.090]  and your outtake and all of that, for that, you need a new carbon filter.
[53:37.730 --> 53:42.930]  But if you're just harvesting outdoor, you're scrubbing the smell of your outdoor, let's say,
[53:42.930 --> 53:56.370]  for like a month, if that, I personally think you can just use a used carbon filter as long as it's
[53:56.370 --> 54:05.410]  not too heavy. There are often people who don't use them that much. There are often people you
[54:05.410 --> 54:11.730]  can see they're pretty clean, they're not all dirty. If it's not too heavy, then you have a
[54:11.730 --> 54:19.250]  good one. And the same with the fans. I actually have a fan that me and my homie purchased 20 years
[54:19.250 --> 54:27.250]  ago. It's an Alisson fan. It still works great. And if you have proper inline fans, they work for
[54:27.250 --> 54:38.290]  a long, long, long time. So your fan, also, you can get that used. I would highly recommend,
[54:39.410 --> 54:46.930]  as far as brands, I would recommend getting an Alisson. I don't even know if they make stuff
[54:46.930 --> 54:55.330]  like that anymore. I mean, we've had that fan for 20 years. Enough said, a fan for 20 years,
[54:56.130 --> 55:00.850]  they're meant to be on. It hasn't been on this whole time for 20 years, but it's definitely
[55:00.850 --> 55:08.370]  been on for years and years at a time. It still works. So definitely, I would look into an Alisson
[55:08.370 --> 55:15.810]  fan. Also, Alisson fans are nice because they're quieter. Let's say you're not worried about quiet,
[55:15.810 --> 55:22.210]  you want something that pushes the most air, I would get a Vortex fan. Vortex fans are noisier,
[55:22.210 --> 55:28.050]  but they still work really well. Also, if you're getting a used fan, one piece of advice I would
[55:28.050 --> 55:32.450]  give you is to make sure that you have somewhere to test it out because all you really need to do
[55:32.450 --> 55:42.450]  is plug it in. You plug in your fan. If you hear rubbing and like, ching, ching, ching, ching, ching,
[55:42.610 --> 55:54.050]  ching, ching, that's not a good fan to use or to purchase. If you plug it in and it's quiet and it
[55:54.050 --> 56:03.810]  just starts up right, then that's cool. It's a good fan. And Diva's talking about using air
[56:03.810 --> 56:11.250]  purifiers for his dry room. I mean, I think that using an air purifier to keep the air in your room
[56:11.570 --> 56:23.970]  is a great idea, but for outdoor on this level, I don't know how well the air purifier
[56:23.970 --> 56:33.570]  cleans the smell out of the air. I just don't know. So yeah, some things I just can't really
[56:33.570 --> 56:38.610]  talk on. I don't know if it will work or not. I do know a carbon filter will work and that will
[56:38.610 --> 56:46.210]  help keep your area from smelling like cannabis. All right. Harvesting, carbon filter, staging,
[56:46.210 --> 56:52.050]  cages. Oh, and tower drying. Yeah. I'm sure a lot of you guys know about this, but those
[56:52.690 --> 56:59.170]  circular towers they sell online or on Amazon, whatever, where it's a bunch of circled towers
[56:59.170 --> 57:05.650]  and it's multiple levels of trays. That's also a really good way to dry material, especially if you
[57:05.650 --> 57:13.010]  have indica material that really needs to be sectioned off into pieces. Those tower trays
[57:13.010 --> 57:21.250]  are great. They also, if let's say you have a four by four tent, you can dry a lot of material
[57:21.250 --> 57:30.370]  on those because you can dry in every single layer of those tents. So they're cool. That being said,
[57:30.370 --> 57:37.730]  they're also kind of a hassle to get the buds out of those trays. You have to kind of grab it and
[57:37.730 --> 57:52.770]  pull it out in a certain way. So they're not my favorite, but they work. So that's another thing.
[57:53.490 --> 57:59.650]  And also, you want to probably an oscillating fan in your tent. You want to look through all
[57:59.650 --> 58:03.730]  of your buds on a daily basis. You want to look for mold. You want to look for,
[58:05.330 --> 58:11.330]  I mean, really you want to look for mold. You want to look for anything that's not ideal.
[58:11.330 --> 58:13.570]  What is Indiva saying? He's not a fan of the tray.
[58:14.450 --> 58:21.010]  Yeah. And I mean, like I'm saying, I'm not a fan of the tray either. It's just often when people
[58:21.010 --> 58:27.410]  are harvesting outdoor, it's a temporary setup. I mean, that's really what it comes down to. It's
[58:27.410 --> 58:31.330]  like when you have an indoor grow, that's a permanent setup. You have all these things
[58:31.970 --> 58:36.850]  set up. They're in their space. That's just where they are. When you harvest your indoor,
[58:36.850 --> 58:41.970]  very often people will dry it in the same place that they were growing it in. So they have that
[58:41.970 --> 58:47.010]  space already designed, already dedicated. But for indoor, it's a different subject because people
[58:47.010 --> 58:53.810]  are growing outdoors. They don't necessarily have a space that's kept year round just to grow their
[58:53.810 --> 58:59.810]  outdoor. They don't have that. It's just something that they make during a certain time of year. So
[58:59.810 --> 59:06.290]  every year they have to make this space for their outdoor. And very often the amount of space that
[59:06.290 --> 59:12.450]  they have is not equal to the amount of outdoor that they have. Often people grow way more outdoor
[59:12.450 --> 59:18.450]  than they have space to dry it. And so that's kind of where it gets into not having these ideal
[59:18.450 --> 59:29.010]  conditions and really kind of having to rig it. So yeah, let's see if my guest comes on. He told
[59:29.010 --> 59:36.210]  me he just woke up. He's making himself some breakfast. Yeah, you're talking about a lot of
[59:36.210 --> 59:43.410]  product. I mean, with outdoor it's kind of like imagine indoor, five harvests per year,
[59:43.410 --> 59:49.170]  you're harvesting at once. So it's just really all at once. And then the other thing I'll get
[59:49.170 --> 59:57.090]  into. So like earlier, I was saying basically when people first start growing, first mistake,
[59:57.090 --> 01:00:03.090]  they start too early. Right? First rookie mistake, people start way too early. They're so juiced.
[01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:12.130]  See people starting like February and with clones and March with clones just way too early. So first
[01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:18.210]  mistake, people start too early. Second mistake, people just give their plants too much love way
[01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:26.850]  too early. It's kind of I mean, to me, it's like running like a marathon. I'm a terrible runner.
[01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:31.250]  I'm a fast runner, not a long runner. But I can just think of it like this. If you're running a
[01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:37.090]  marathon, and you're a terrible runner off the bat, you're like running hella fast. And you're
[01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:42.050]  just like, you know, beating everybody because you're like, this is easy. I'm running so fast.
[01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:46.850]  And you're maybe a quarter into the race, and you're just taking off and you feel good. And
[01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:52.130]  you're like, yeah, and you're running fast. And that's the exact same thing with the outdoor
[01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:56.850]  season. And then you know, halfway through the season, you're like, okay, I'm kind of tired.
[01:00:56.850 --> 01:01:04.450]  I'm kind of tired. Three quarters way through the season. So it's like August, people are tired.
[01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:11.250]  And that is the rookie mistake is that people get burned out. And they're just like, over it.
[01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:16.450]  It's August, their plants are going into flower, they're seeing issues. And they're getting tired
[01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:23.650]  of dealing with their plants every day. Experienced gardeners, this is usually when they take a break.
[01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:28.450]  And for me, sometime in September, I'll usually take a break, we'll go on vacation
[01:01:29.410 --> 01:01:38.050]  for a couple days and just take a rest. Now we're in August, excuse me, October. So let's say we're
[01:01:38.050 --> 01:01:44.930]  we're running a marathon, and now you're at the last quarter of the race. This is when the vets
[01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:51.170]  start taking off. This is when the people who win the races start running faster. And it's the same
[01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:57.570]  thing with harvesting outdoor. It's the exact same thing. When you go into October, this is when
[01:01:57.570 --> 01:02:03.730]  you pull out all the stops. This is not when you pace yourself. This is when you make sure that
[01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:09.490]  every single bud is where it needs to be. You make sure that you cut out the bud rot, the caterpillars,
[01:02:09.490 --> 01:02:17.890]  you make sure because this is the last stretch. This is where it all really counts. And,
[01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:26.770]  you know, it's important that you have the energy to put it out now, because now is the time that
[01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:34.690]  you need to land that big fish. This is the time you need to get those buds secured into your
[01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:40.770]  location and dried. That's really what this time of the year is securing those buds and having the
[01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:50.050]  right mental, emotional, and I don't know, mental, emotional and physical energy there. I've been on
[01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:57.890]  farms where the head person is losing their shade and yelling at everybody and is not in the right
[01:02:57.890 --> 01:03:05.890]  mental state and is using drugs and this and that. And it just is not doesn't make the right
[01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:12.290]  harvesting environment. That's really what you need is you need a harvesting environment. And
[01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:19.010]  the harvesting environment is, you know, it's not just too calm and chill. No, there's a there's
[01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:24.370]  urgency. This is the weed that you're going to be smoking all year. So you have the urgency,
[01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:29.010]  you harvest all of your material and really you're just harvesting it and letting it cure in those
[01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:35.970]  Tupperwares. And then maybe a month from now, so we harvest everything and then we take another
[01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:42.130]  break. And that's really important. So we harvest and then we break and we rest and, you know,
[01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:47.650]  smoke a little bit, whatever, and let your material cure. You get all your totes, you buy a bunch of
[01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:55.250]  totes and have everything curing in totes. You're checking your totes and you're resting so that
[01:03:55.250 --> 01:04:01.650]  then you can go into then trimming your material, which is the last part and processing that
[01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:07.570]  material. And I mean, shoot, like for a lot of people, they're like, yeah, yeah, Jamal, I know
[01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:13.250]  all this. I've been doing this forever. But the reason you know this is probably from all kinds
[01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:21.890]  of crazy experiences that we've all had. And those experiences really hopefully teach us how to make
[01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:26.210]  better decisions in the future. I mean, I used to work at a grow shop and people would come in
[01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:31.650]  every single year with the same mistakes and it'd be the same people, the same mistakes every single
[01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:43.970]  year. So, you know, don't make those same mistakes. You know, move forward. Harvest that material,
[01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:52.210]  land it, dry it. It's important. It's incumbent that you land that material. Also, I think of it
[01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:57.010]  like when you have material that goes to bud rot, powder mildew, and you throw it away, that's a
[01:04:57.010 --> 01:05:03.490]  waste. That's a waste of fertilizer. That's a waste of water. That's a waste of time. I don't
[01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:07.330]  like wasting things. To me, that feels like I just grew some food and threw it in the garbage.
[01:05:08.050 --> 01:05:16.690]  So, you know, really giving it the attention it deserves is important. And let's say at a
[01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:22.130]  certain point you don't have the attention to give a certain plant. You can always cut it.
[01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:29.490]  Sometimes it's better just to get rid of it than to have these things keep moving along and they're
[01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:34.530]  not healthy and it's not happy and it's not successful. Sometimes it's better just to
[01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:37.650]  identify something and being like, I'm not going to work with that plant. I'm cutting it.
[01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:44.130]  And very often that happens. I harvested a plant. It was three weeks into flower. And I looked at
[01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:48.450]  that plant and I was like, this is not what I want. This is not what I'm looking for.
[01:05:50.370 --> 01:05:55.730]  This plant is not getting the attention that it deserves. I'm going to cut this plant. And it felt
[01:05:55.730 --> 01:06:00.130]  kind of weird because I knew I could have let the plant go all the way to flower. Probably would
[01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:04.610]  have been like a quarter pound or something. I don't know, worth smoke. I mean, it would have
[01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:11.250]  been all right. But in my head, I was like, this plant is going to end up getting thrown away next
[01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:16.290]  year. I'm not going to smoke this. I'm going to pay somebody to trim this or trim it myself. I'm
[01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:20.450]  going to do all this energy and nothing's going to happen to this material. And that's an issue.
[01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:27.570]  So let's go into another issue, throwing away cannabis. I mean, I don't know, people I'm
[01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:33.010]  assuming are from all parts of all over the place. So some people may not throw away pounds
[01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:38.530]  of cannabis and some other people might. But or, you know, instead of throwing it away, compost
[01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:43.330]  instead and rubbish. But still, it's like, you know, I'll be honest. This year there were pounds
[01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:52.530]  of cannabis that I put into my green net. And that's something I need to keep stock of. That
[01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:58.370]  was an overproduction. And when you overproduce, that's money going out of your pocket. I paid
[01:06:58.370 --> 01:07:04.610]  somebody to process that material, the fertilizer, the water, the time, the space, all of those
[01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:10.450]  things. And that material is just sitting there. And, you know, now I have new stuff coming in.
[01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:17.730]  Last year's outdoors still have these bags of weed that wasn't trimmed last year, bags of buds that
[01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:23.010]  are just sitting there. That stuff needs to go. But I need more importantly to think,
[01:07:24.530 --> 01:07:29.650]  how do I need to process things differently next year so that I don't have things wasted?
[01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:34.930]  And one of the, I mean, the best tools for that is to have a rosin press and to make extracts.
[01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:41.970]  You know, if you have a rosin press, you can press stuff into rosin. And then, you know,
[01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:46.450]  for example, I have jars of rosin in my fridge right now from last year. I'm okay with that.
[01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:51.250]  Those can sit in there for whatever. I can smoke them. I can make edibles with it, whatever. That's
[01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:58.530]  not wasted. That material is kind of sitting there and it's chilling. And I can use that whenever.
[01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:07.970]  But yeah, you know, maybe some people should grow less plants than they did. Maybe, you know,
[01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:13.810]  I grew too many plants last year. Maybe I grew too many plants this year. I mean, it's a weird
[01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:17.650]  thing. Like in this community, you think, you know, everybody, it's like, you want to grow as
[01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:23.410]  many plants as you can that are going to be good. That's my thinking. I'm never like, oh, that's
[01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:27.570]  going to be too many plants. I'm always like, I want to do as many as I can. You know, of course,
[01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:33.490]  within my limits, but you know, my legal limits. But in general, that's, you know, what does he
[01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:42.850]  say? Oh, freeze dryer. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Freeze dryer, freeze dryer, hash. I mean, that's really
[01:08:43.650 --> 01:08:48.850]  the future. I mean, that's the future of outdoors as well. But you know, it's, if you don't have
[01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:54.930]  those things, or for example, for me, I have a child. She's almost two. So last year, she was
[01:08:54.930 --> 01:09:02.290]  almost one. She was crazy. Kid was almost one. It was very difficult to process material. It was
[01:09:02.290 --> 01:09:12.130]  just, it was a lot of work. So, you know, it's incumbent that you, you know, that you manage your
[01:09:12.130 --> 01:09:20.130]  material properly. You know, it's important. So we're going to move on to our next section,
[01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:29.170]  which is I'm going to make another cool edible for you guys. And hopefully I can manifest Isaac
[01:09:29.170 --> 01:09:39.490]  coming on for the last part of the show. So today I don't have a helper. So it'll be
[01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:48.130]  a little bit different today, but I'm going to do my best. And you know, in the chat, if
[01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:52.210]  you guys think something is awry, please let me know.
[01:09:52.530 --> 01:09:59.090]  But yeah, I figured it'd be nice to continuously make some edibles with you guys. I can show you
[01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:10.930]  guys some cool stuff that I've made throughout the years. So today, all right, let me see how
[01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:21.230]  this will work. All right, so I'm in the chat. All right, so I'm going to need you guys as
[01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:30.670]  info in the chat. If, yeah, I'll need you guys as info in the chat. Let me know if you can't hear
[01:10:30.670 --> 01:10:42.980]  me, if you can't see what's going on. Okay, so today the edible that we're going to make
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:52.980]  is called Banglossie. Banglossie is a traditional Indian, Indian smoothie. And
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:11:02.820]  often it is used making, used with weed milk. Now the way that they make it is they actually
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:09.380]  boil the cannabis with water and then use a mortar and pestle to grind either the flowers or the hash
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:17.940]  with milk. And then they take that milk and then mix it into this smoothie type of concoction
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:22.580]  with the one that I'm going to be making. It will be slightly different.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:31.140]  Just put it out there. I'm not doing any weed milk this morning because I have to harvest today. I
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:36.660]  have too much stuff going on. And my wife said that she would kill me if I got half of weed milk
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:44.100]  at nine in the morning or 10 in the morning. So I'm kind of faking the funk a little bit today.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:50.340]  So I'm kind of faking the funk a little bit today, but that's no problem. But for this one,
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:57.700]  what we're going to use is we have our mango or Mangolossie. We have some yogurt, mango yogurt.
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:05.060]  I'm going to use a little bit of this organic coconut smoothie. And you could definitely
[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:13.780]  use this and infuse this with cannabis. Or you could put, take some milk, which is what we used
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:20.740]  to do. We would take milk, put some trim and we would boil it for 12 hours. That's how we would
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:25.700]  do it. And you would take basically a shot of milk or a half shot of milk. And we would put
[01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:29.620]  that into our material. And the other thing that we also are going to put in is a little bit of
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:41.520]  chai masala. Now also keep in mind that mango, here, let me close this real quick. All right.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:46.240]  So mango is supposed to potentiate the THC and the cannabis. So that should help make it
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:50.480]  a little bit stronger. And also the chai masala, these herbs in here are,
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:59.440]  I don't want to say they make it stronger, but they definitely add something, a little twang
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:08.800]  to it that in my opinion, really helps with a very interesting effect. Tell the wifey probation
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:14.640]  is over. No, no. It's more of just like she wants me to not be asleep for the whole day. Because
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:21.680]  you know, it just works super well. Flip and reverse. I'm not sure what you mean by flip and
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:29.520]  reverse. So yeah, basically I'll make this, I'll make it for you. So I'll show you guys. So we're
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:41.360]  just going to cut up some mango. A little bit of egg still on there. Man, look at this mango. It's
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:55.710]  just dang. Let me wash my hands. So yeah, take this mango, which I mean, look how it's peeling.
[01:13:57.390 --> 01:14:05.950]  Super dank mango. And once again, like with these edibles, like obviously I'm not like some crazy
[01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:12.190]  chef or anything, but I like to cook and I'm a stunner and I like to make edibles, but I don't
[01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:19.550]  have to plan too far in advance because if I make a whole container of cookies, I'm going to eat
[01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:29.950]  them all. And that's just all bad on multiple levels. So I have my mango here, put half the
[01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:40.030]  mango in there. I mean, this is freaking super easy hack. Take my coconut smoothie. I could have
[01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:45.630]  this infused or not. You could take milk, infuse it. You can take this coconut smoothie, infuse it,
[01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:59.170]  put some of this in there. Dang. I'm going to put some yogurt in there. Boom.
[01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:10.380]  Put some, wash my hands. Put some chai masala in there,
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:21.260]  which is actually hella tight. So this is a chai tea mixture and yeah, it really works well in your
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:25.980]  smoothies. And also, you know, like adding herbs, especially a lot of Indian herbs really do help
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:32.940]  to potentiate the cannabis. And you know, it really makes for a very interesting effect and
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:36.940]  high when you have other things in there. Like for example, like when you have like a brownie
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:40.700]  or something that has a lot of sugar in it, you'll notice that there's a certain type of high,
[01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:47.180]  but also when you have other herbs in there, like one of them is masala, it brings a very
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:57.420]  interesting, it brings a nice effect to it. So I'll put one, two, three, some chai masala in there.
[01:15:58.540 --> 01:16:05.980]  So I'll put in a little bit more yogurt and maybe a little milk. And that's pretty much it.
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:23.580]  And I'll make sure that I put in a little bit of milk.
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:31.580]  All right, put a little bit of milk in there. So normally this would be the infused aspect of it,
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:42.480]  maybe a shot, but I'm not doing that today. And once again, you know, like you can look
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:51.280]  it up online and there's lots of different recipes for bang lassi. So it's a bang lassi
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:17:02.960]  and it's a B-H-A-N-G, I believe, bang. And this is yeah, traditional Indian cannabis infused drink.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:08.240]  I believe this drink, people have been drinking things like this for thousands of years. And it's
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:17.920]  really cool because there's even the way that they, there's a story of creation and how the
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:24.960]  world was created. It has to do with the way that they churn the milk and infuse the milk
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:31.920]  with the cannabis. And I like, I think it's pretty cool about this recipe or even traditionally
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:38.880]  making this, you know, the way that they make this is that they boil the cannabis with water
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:45.280]  and then use a mortar and pestle to grind it together with the milk. And I've,
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:52.320]  it's the first time I'd ever heard anything like that. You know, and it kind of like opens up the
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.280]  trichomes as you like grind it together. So I'm going to mute you guys so you don't have to hear
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:24.380]  my crazy blend. All right, we're done. Blend it up. Pour this into my cup and we'll go and
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:40.710]  keep moving on. So far it's delicious. It's so delicious. It's just, I mean, it's literally
[01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:56.700]  mango, coconut milk, a little bit of yogurt, some chai masala in there. That's it. Also,
[01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:02.300]  people say that the mango makes the cannabis work better. It's a really delicious drink.
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:12.780]  And yeah, I mean, you know, you can make a single serving. You could really dictate your potency
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:18.860]  when you're using milk. I would just, you know, really caution you to go on the lighter side
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:23.500]  because it is super potent, super, super potent. But also, I mean, you can't like,
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:26.700]  because there's mango in here, because there's masala in here,
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:30.620]  like you can't really taste if there happened to be cannabis in there, you can't really taste it.
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:41.720]  Yeah, I mean, you can't taste it. It's just a truly delicious, delicious drink.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:46.440]  But yeah, I mean, I'm missing the best part of it, which is the cannabis. But,
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:52.280]  you know, I have way more harvesting to be done today. You know, like my kid is away. So like,
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:56.680]  this is my opportunity to get a lot of work done. So like, you know, in general,
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:02.280]  during harvest time is not when you want to be eating a lot of edibles. You know, this is now
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:08.040]  when I need to be on point, you know, really get get things going. This person is saying,
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:13.240]  wait, what you just blend the defresh herb? Yeah, so when you're when you're making Lassi,
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.760]  the traditional, that's a really good question. So there's two different ways of doing it. So the
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:22.760]  traditional way, you take a mortar and pestle and literally ground your cannabis with milk.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:28.680]  So you're like opening up, you're physically opening up the trichome heads into your milk.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:37.720]  And that is how it's incorporated. The way that I usually would do it was I would boil milk
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:43.800]  with trim in it and then use that like a shot of that milk or let's say a half shot of that
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:51.400]  infused weed milk into my Lassi. And that's I mean, that's kind of how I would do it.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:21:02.680]  But yeah, I mean, I think eating raw, you know, people are like boiling it isn't decarbing it.
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:09.480]  You know, I'm not really I'm not I don't really want to talk on if it I mean, I tried it and it
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:16.680]  works. I don't know if does it work as well as heating up the milk? In my opinion? No, it does
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:23.560]  not work as well. But you know, it's a it's traditional, you know, and it's like we shouldn't
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:27.080]  like I don't want to like shit on other cultures or anything. It's like I just want to learn
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:36.040]  and try different things. And you know, I really also like adding the herbs to it and the mango to
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:48.040]  it. I feel like that really adds a nice, you know, x variable to, you know, to the experience
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:54.360]  to this thing. Because you know, like, a lot of us are consuming cannabis for health reasons. And
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:59.400]  so there's no reason that you can't also have these other things, you know, combined with it.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:22.280]  Delicious. All right. So let me see. So I guess my guests may not be coming on today. So
[01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:35.020]  all right. So yeah, I think the last thing we'll go into today looks like my guests may not be
[01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:41.660]  coming. But you know, it's no problem. We're still moving along nicely. And, you know, still have
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:47.180]  some really cool things we can talk about. Thank you. Cheers to my health and cheers to your guys'
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:53.260]  health and cheers to, you know, starting the weekend, right? Because I mean, you know,
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:57.580]  in our system, you know, people literally work themselves to death. So
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:10.960]  yeah, sure dog. Dog days, I'll send you an invite right now. Hold on a second.
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:34.980]  I'm gonna send Indiva one too. So yeah, I sent, just sent an invite to Indiva and Dog Days. You
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:41.460]  guys, I just sent you guys an invite. You guys are welcome to come right on. Gosh, it was something I
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:47.060]  wanted to address with you guys. Come on, Jamal's brain. Come on, brain, brain, brain.
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:52.820]  Ah, that's what it was. Okay. And this is something in particular I'd love for the people in the chat
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:58.820]  as well. I'm just curious, strains you guys grew this year that you thought did really well.
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:03.060]  You know, I love to just hear things that people would grow again, things that people would not
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:12.340]  grow again, especially for outdoor. Yeah, that's something I'm,
[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:13.220]  what's up, doggy?
[01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:18.140]  What up?
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:27.820]  Yeah, get, you know, get yourself, however ready you need to do. But yeah, I would just say I'm
[01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:33.420]  asking people in the chat, you know, strains that you guys would grow again. That's something I'm
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:37.020]  really interested in. And even more importantly, strains you would not grow again.
[01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:44.300]  Because, yeah, I mean, you know, in particular for outdoor, you know, so I would say strains
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:50.220]  that I would grow again. I did some TK Chem D that crushed it this year. I did some pure Kush
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:56.860]  that did really, really well this year. Things that I would not grow again. That looks interesting.
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:59.580]  This is the narrow end of the spectrum.
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:04.620]  Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I think, you know, I think, you know,
[01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:05.420]  that looks interesting.
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:10.620]  This is the narrow one. I got a couple that are wider, but this is the one I'm really
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:16.140]  liking. It's got a really narrow leaf. It was throwing out some 11s too already.
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:17.420]  What plant is that?
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:19.260]  The Super Skunk F4.
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:23.420]  Oh, interesting. Do you have any plants that you would grow again or not grow again?
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:27.980]  I'm growing everything again. Nothing leaves my garden when it comes here.
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:36.060]  But I don't know. I really like that SR-71 Purple Kush. I'm excited to have more flower of that.
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:38.140]  That really helps me sleep.
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:46.700]  Plants I got going right now though. I'm about to flip this 8x8 into flower.
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:53.080]  This is my new 8x8 tent. I'm fucking loving it.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:54.840]  Nice.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:59.800]  And yeah, I'm going to flip this whole tent soon. I got a room next door that has
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:05.560]  those six top dog strains in flower right now. I just pollinated them yesterday.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:12.200]  I'm about to take the bags off and whatnot. Yeah, this is that Super Skunk. This one's got a
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:17.640]  much, much more narrow leaf than the rest of them. It's really looks like pretty lanky.
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:24.120]  Doesn't quite have like the crazy internodal spacing of like the TK back there, but it's
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:30.040]  got a lot more than the others. Then I got two more. They're in smaller pots.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.760]  But I kept clones off all of them. This one's kind of more wider leaf,
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:44.120]  a little tighter internodal spacing. There's another one. They all are looking good though.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:50.920]  So there's nothing in your garden that you're not as juiced about as other things?
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:58.600]  Um, no, man, I love everything in my garden. I guess like the stuff I'm popping from seed,
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:04.200]  I guess you could say like I'm not running those same cuts again, because I'm making F2s so I can
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:09.400]  hunt through a larger population of seed. But like all the cuts I have, I've kind of been like
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:14.840]  collecting older cuts and stuff and I will never let any of them go unless they get sick. I've had
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:20.600]  to let go of a few because of sickness, but fingers crossed. Nice. So which ones are your
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:26.680]  favorites then? That's a hard question. I'm really excited for this Trinity. Like one of my homies
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:31.000]  sent me the cut. He sent me an ounce of the flower and it was some of the best fucking weed I've ever
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:37.320]  smoked in my life. Truly skunky weed. I loved it. So like that one I'm super excited for.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:43.240]  I'm really excited for the triangle cush and the G sole. I haven't grown them out yet. So this will
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:48.040]  be my first run with them. I don't know man, that's a really hard question. They're all kind
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:53.640]  of my favorite. I'll go to the mom room. That's where my favorites are. So this person Lance said
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:28:02.440]  auto outside BCN critical. I'm curious what the BCN is. And I'm also curious like regarding
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:07.800]  autos. I think this next spring I might grow some autos just so I have some like
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:13.640]  smoke on. I'll send you some autos. My cousin breeds autos. If you'd want to run any of his
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:20.680]  beans, I can send you some and they're really fucking good. Sure. Yeah, I've grown. I've grown
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:26.520]  two of his hybrids and he really works. He works his lines too. Like he made a Spokane Hayes or
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:34.200]  yes, the Spokane Hayes is the auto line that he made and he worked at six generations until he
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:40.920]  got to where he wanted to outcross it. And then he he's made some out crosses with rock bud ink
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:47.640]  lines that he liked. The one I've grown was a great slurry cross and then a big purple rocket
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:54.680]  cross. They're really good dude like super frosty. If you go back into my like first posts on IG
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:59.320]  is where I got pictures of them. They look good man like you couldn't tell that it was auto.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:07.320]  It was really frosty resonance, just beautiful weed. Really good high. Yeah, so like the high
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:13.640]  on that fucking Spokane Hayes or well it's a Spokane slurry was the hybrid I grew. But it was
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:19.480]  really interesting man. It was like almost psychedelic. You would still put your dick in
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:25.880]  the dirt like a good fucking like it would hit you like an OG kind of. Not full on couch lock,
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:32.760]  but it was it was sedating you know. But it also had this like mind racing fucking like just
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:39.480]  trippy psychedelic kind of stone dude. It's really good. He said that comes from the
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:48.040]  Spokane Hayes that he used. That's cool. Sorry, I'm just I'm just spilling my volcano bag.
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:54.600]  And that was that outdoor indoor. I grew that indoor. He runs them outdoor too. And I've seen
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:30:04.120]  him grow some beautiful ones outside. Yeah, I mean I'm kind of. I'm kind of so okay. So for like
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:12.200]  outdoor people usually harvest let's say in October, November and you know all you know weed is
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:21.080]  you know all you know weed is fire until let's say March, February, March,
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:29.400]  April. So like about April, May right. And then it usually to about April or May then your weed
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:34.920]  really starts to go downhill from that point. May, June then your stuff starts to get brown.
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:42.680]  You know what I mean? So like if I could harvest something in June, that would be great. Then you
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:47.080]  could have something to smoke during the whole summer that's not brown old outdoor.
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:54.280]  I kind of did this something similar like the same kind of idea but indoor. Like I just grew
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:58.760]  them in my veg space and I was like you know I'll have these and I'll get a little early harvest
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:03.720]  before my flower runs done. That's exactly what happened too. And the but like the bud was killer
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:08.520]  man. I just ran them in my veg tent. I didn't even get a whole lot of light compared to everything
[01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:15.320]  else. I think that first one the last two weeks of flower is like I did put it in the flower room
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:20.440]  under more intense light and it kind of it kind of stacked up some resin on it. But like I was
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:25.640]  really surprised at the quality of them for like the fact that I just grew them in the veg room.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:32.600]  That's awesome. And also like I'm hearing people say like you know for outdoor people that they
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:40.840]  can put autos basically around the perimeter of their big main plants. And that you know once
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:48.040]  their you know once their main plants really start getting going the autos are done. You know what I
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:53.160]  mean? And it just kind of gives you a little extra something. And I mean I'm thinking I'm
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:32:00.440]  curious anybody if anybody is in the this person Lance is saying VCN is critical is a critical
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:10.520]  billbo. That's critical mass. Interesting. Yeah interesting. But yeah I mean I think that's a
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:15.000]  really cool thing for people to do in the future is to basically put their main plant. Let's say
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:25.880]  you have like a 60 gallon pot. So in May let's say you plant your seedling and then in May you put in
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:33.800]  your your mace your main seedling. But in March you put in your autos so that your autos will be
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:38.680]  is that right? So that your autos will be ready in like what June? Yeah you can do that. It depends
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:46.120]  which ones you get. The that Spokane slurry from seed from the day I planted it was 84 days to the
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:51.320]  day I cut it. So like like three months. And there's some that go quicker than that too. Like
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:58.360]  there's like 60 day autos. I think the next ones I grew went like 65 days from seed. So like two
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:04.840]  to three months and you got fucking bud. I mean I think that's killer. And like what I think would
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:10.760]  be I mean I don't know if this is possible but I think it'd be really cool to like mash an auto
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:18.760]  with like a straight equatorial plant that like needs a long ass time. I mean I'm sure there
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:23.480]  people are trying that. There's some reason. Like take this dog shit cut that I got it goes like 14
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:29.480]  weeks and fucking cross it with an auto. Yeah because they you know really get some cool stuff.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:35.720]  And I've heard like Mendo 2020 they actually had a really cool podcast on breeding. I'd recommend
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:40.840]  check out you guys check out Mendo 2020. They're talking about how they breed autos which seems
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:46.920]  fairly complex. And he was talking about how they have some autos that go maybe like close to closer
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:52.760]  to like 100 days. Yeah you know people want those. Like there's people that are trying to do that
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:58.200]  because if you can get autos that'll go that long you can get massive auto flower plants. Like I
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:03.000]  haven't seen these plants that are their autos and they're pulling a fucking pound off of them indoor
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.440]  because they're going 110 days and they're just getting monstrous. Exactly and I mean for me like
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:14.360]  outdoors if I could get like a five six pound plant finished in June. Yeah like yeah I think
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.960]  you can do that. Like you find the right auto genetics dude. I think you could totally pull
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:22.360]  that off too. Like run a four or five pound auto plant have it harvested early for you.
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:27.560]  Yeah I mean that would that would change the whole game. I mean that's it's kind of like how to get
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:32.520]  out of not having to pull tarps for light depth. Like to me that's kind of you know it's like if
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:37.160]  you can have a plant that just does that for you then I mean you can theoretically harvest the
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:43.480]  whole year. I was skeptical too. Like I was kind of skeptical about how the quality was going to be
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:47.960]  with an auto flower but it like the ones my cousin made man they're really good and I got
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:54.840]  some of the same ones I grew too. So that's good to know because I mean I also like I smoked last
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:35:02.600]  year I grew like a semi-auto maybe was the year before and the response was not positive. People
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:09.560]  did not like how it smoked. Yeah yeah I was I was thoroughly impressed with this. It was fucking
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:17.000]  good. That's that's good to know. What are you rolling up? Primus. I fucking love that Primus.
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.760]  It's what everyone likes. When I went to CannaCon and like when I've met Duke man everyone just
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:33.560]  remembers the Primus. This is the one that turns heads. Interesting. I don't know and Diva if you
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:37.800]  can hear me it says your device is not connected so you need to connect your mic before I can let
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:47.560]  you on. You like the spirit train. What is the Primus again? It's a three-way blend of Arcada
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:58.540]  Cut-A-Train Wreck, Pre-98 Bubba Kush and Cam-91. I smoked the Arcada Cut-A-Train Wreck. I don't
[01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:05.500]  feel comfortable putting that story online regarding the Arcada Train Wreck but I definitely
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:18.780]  hear all that. I met this girl in my what was that class? It was like women it was like sociology of
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:24.140]  women. I met this girl when I was in junior college in my sociology of women class. What
[01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:28.460]  do you take a sociology of women class for Jamal? Are you trying to understand women better?
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:37.340]  Dude there were hella girls in the class. That's why I took it. Get to know them a little better.
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:43.020]  Yeah I see what you're doing. That's smart. And yeah and Diva I'll let you in whenever it says
[01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:49.660]  I can but I'm not I literally cannot it says device is not connected. But yeah so this I
[01:36:49.660 --> 01:37:02.220]  had this class and this girl from the class invited me on a date and I was actually broke that day.
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:16.540]  I was broke that day and we went out to eat and she brought brought out some train wreck
[01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:31.020]  that she said was from Arcada. This was in gosh 2003. Oh hell yeah. So she busted out with this
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:35.500]  weed. She said it was from Arcada. She said it was some train wreck. She was like I don't know
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:39.340]  do you want to smoke? Like she's like I don't really smoke but like if you want to smoke I
[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:47.020]  have this weed from Arcada. It's some train wreck. And I was like yes. And I looked in the bag
[01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:55.500]  and it was like the most fire train wreck I had ever seen. It was just like the buds were
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:38:01.260]  it's like you know I mean people know train wreck it's like the Diva buds but covered like
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:09.420]  covered in trichomes like an indica. Just like frosted out so fire so so so fire. It was just
[01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:17.980]  ridiculous and it must have been like in October like November like the buds were so fresh it was
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:23.180]  just delicious. I rolled it up and it would not smoke you know what I mean like you tried to smoke
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:29.180]  it it just kept going out every single time because it was like the I mean because it was the good
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:37.980]  shit. And then I remember all of a sudden she was like my ex-boyfriend is calling me like you need
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:43.900]  to go something's going on and I remember getting in my car and feeling so paranoid.
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:51.580]  So so paranoid and that's how you know it's the good shit. I was like who the hell is following me
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:59.420]  blah blah blah. It was the it was the good shit I mean it was that was the it was the
[01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:11.420]  arcaded train wreck that stuff is stupid stupid fire and it yeah it was it was ridiculous. It was
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:17.420]  it was some of the best train wreck I've ever had. Yeah hell yeah. Yeah I don't know.
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:21.420]  I don't have a whole lot of experience with train wreck I've only had it once
[01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:27.500]  in my life. It was really good weed though and I got it on like the black market in Utah so I don't
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:32.780]  know like I mean I don't I think it was the real train wreck because that that chick I used to buy
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:39.180]  weed from out there was and she had some good shit but it was different. Yeah I mean the train
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:42.300]  yeah I mean the train wreck is different it's like it's very lemony.
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:46.220]  It's um these are my coyotes.
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:51.580]  All right these are coyotes they're coyote german shepherd hybrids.
[01:39:52.860 --> 01:40:00.300]  They're so sweet I love them. Are they like super pack oriented? Oh yeah oh yeah makes it way easy
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:05.820]  to train them too. I thought it was going to be harder because they're wild but they're uh they're
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:09.820]  both females so they look at me like the alpha male. I think if they were males it would be a
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:13.980]  little bit different but because they're both females they look at me like the pack leader
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:19.100]  and they listen to anything I say. If I yell at any of the other dogs they'll attack them like if I
[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:23.740]  if I yell at a dog or if I yell at something they'll go attack it and back me up it's really cool.
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:26.860]  How many dogs do you have? Five.
[01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:34.220]  I came out here with one dog bro but I have I have a soft spot for animals and I've rescued
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:43.830]  four since I've been here. Well we just lost dog days that was kind of trippy.
[01:40:44.630 --> 01:40:50.870]  Um well yeah I'll just go into train rack for a little bit. Basically train rack has like super
[01:40:50.870 --> 01:41:02.550]  sativa type buds um but the effect is I mean is train racky it's very strong. Um some nice things
[01:41:02.630 --> 01:41:08.390]  about a train rack the whole plant can be put into a bag so like you know it yields really well
[01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:14.870]  because you know like the whole thing looks fire. It's it's got potency the buds are usually pretty
[01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:21.110]  like medium size it would be a great candidate for outdoors. Train rack really would do very very
[01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:31.500]  very well outdoors. Um what else can I say about train rack? Um I mean. Sorry I lost you for a sec.
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:36.300]  Yeah no you did you were out like back in the day and you know in Cali in the medical scene
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:43.500]  train rack was like a huge staple it was really a staple. Um Axe that had a homie that's all he
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:49.820]  would grow he would grow train rack for BPG and all the spots around. Um and I mean honestly if
[01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:54.460]  you if train rack is around it probably is the real train rack it's not really one that's like
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:59.420]  faked that much. Um you can tell like the structure of the plant looks very different.
[01:41:59.500 --> 01:42:05.180]  It has the Arcada train rack thing like um someone S1'd the Arcada train rack and sold
[01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:11.260]  those seed packs as Arcada train racks. So there from what I've heard there is a couple of the S1s
[01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:23.500]  that go around. Sure and I mean it's like I don't I mean man I guess this gets into like a sticky
[01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:31.980]  subject like for me if it had train wreck-y type turps which is that turpilene that's super
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:40.460]  dominant. Yeah the turpineline. Yeah turpineline like if it had that turpineline for me it's like
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:46.460]  it's train rack you know is it an S1 is it not if it has that train wreck-y thing and it's chronic
[01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:52.540]  I'd be like that's that's good enough it's train rack. I want to get that train rack cut and like
[01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:57.260]  make hybrids with it and see how it breeds. Because this Primus like it has the Bubba the
[01:42:57.260 --> 01:43:04.140]  Chem 91 and that train wreck and um it's 50% train wreck though like the uh they made they took the
[01:43:04.140 --> 01:43:09.660]  Chem 91 reversed it onto the Bubba and then they took a selection of that and it got reversed onto
[01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:15.900]  the train wreck. So it's like the train wreck is the mom and like it doesn't remind me of the train
[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:23.100]  wreck I had at all like this is really nasty like cheesy fucking just foul good weed like I don't
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:26.860]  know where that cheesiness comes from I don't know if it's coming from the Chem or the Bubba.
[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:30.140]  Part of me thinks it's got to be coming from the train wreck because I've smoked a lot of like
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:35.740]  Bubba and Chem hybrids and they're they're not really cheesy like this. I mean a lot of the
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:41.660]  a lot of the turpineline stuff will will like amplify turps you know what I mean and make
[01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:51.660]  things like extra gnarly which is cool. So I know like like I don't know if you're familiar with like
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:55.660]  uh like sub-cools.
[01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:57.660]  Sub? Yeah I know what sub-cool is.
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:06.860]  So my smoke excuse me guys my smoke alarm just went off because I was vaping inside I guess.
[01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:08.860]  Your volcano set it off?
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:17.900]  Yeah um but I know like a lot of like um sub-cool used to work his um yeah I was gonna say his his
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:26.940]  um time wreck and the time wreck really helped boost other things and make them fire.
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:36.060]  That's cool you know working with the turpineline can it can help boost but it can also just make a
[01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:42.540]  whole bunch of things that just have a whole shitload of turpineline in it which honestly is
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:50.300]  not my favorite and like you know some people are like oh you know like turpineline is so bad but
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:55.340]  like if you have a whole bunch of different shit hey what's up Nick the turpineline I think is the
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:45:00.940]  last thing I'll end up smoking. What's your what's your feeling on turpineline Nick?
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:09.820]  As in what I don't know I mean like I smoked so much trainwreck back in like
[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:16.220]  fucking 05-06 dude like I got sick of it like I I was glad to see it go but it's like I would
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:20.780]  love to see it come back like I would love to have that cut again and I asked my buddy who I
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:27.820]  used to get it from and he didn't have any seeds of it so yeah I don't know. So basically like having
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:29.340]  a plant of it would mean more.
[01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:41.980]  Have you washed any? Have I? Yeah. Uh no no I have not I have not had the pleasure to wash
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:48.860]  any trainwreck I wasn't washing them I mean yeah that was fucking a long time ago you know shit.
[01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:53.980]  So I have a question for you have you had a pleasure of washing many old school varieties
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:46:01.420]  or is it mainly more more current stuff modern stuff? It's it's uh I'd say probably more current
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:09.500]  stuff I'd like to get into a lot older stuff um I did find I sold my washer actually um
[01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:20.220]  and the person I sold it to he has the the strawberry cough from 2002 and like the coals
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:27.340]  on it are fucking massive dude so and he washes as well of course and he's washing that and it
[01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:32.860]  turned out lovely so he's gonna uh give me a cut of that so I'm gonna run that shit here pretty
[01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:39.260]  soon which is gonna be awesome so. That's cool yeah I mean I have a theory that a lot of the
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:47.660]  older school stuff would not wash as well. I would say it's good. I think this after would.
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:52.460]  It's it's all gonna depend on the plant you know because like there are certain plants that you
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:57.100]  know you can look at it and it's you know you can look at a plant if it's gonna wash well or not I
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:47:02.460]  mean kind of that away but you know like there I mean you can look at a plant and like you know
[01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:08.380]  if it doesn't have like a bunch of trichomes and it's not covered in it and more like eco type
[01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:14.620]  land race then you know no it's not gonna wash well but I mean it doesn't mean what you get out
[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:19.740]  of it's not gonna be great but it's not gonna be a lot of it's it's not gonna be what um worth
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:25.340]  people's time you know you you'd be better off just smoking a lot of it you know exactly I mean
[01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:34.380]  like my point was kind of like like for example the plant the Dutch treat which like um and it
[01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:41.340]  doesn't wash well like you don't get a great return the material is is wet is like oily
[01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:48.380]  yeah well that's the bit too though you know oily plants do not wash well and that's just it you
[01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:53.980]  need a sand gritty type of plant or texture of the trichome anyways is what you're after for
[01:47:53.980 --> 01:48:06.060]  resonant quality and it's also darker resin so it's oily it comes out darker but I mean is it
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:12.220]  of course right I mean it's it's it's good medicine it's I mean just because it doesn't
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:18.780]  wash doesn't mean it doesn't make great fucking hash by any means you know like you can also like
[01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:23.660]  if if you have a plant that doesn't wash too well but you still want to make hash out of it you can
[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:30.940]  do dry sift it and and go about it that way too you know which is still a great option right so
[01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:35.100]  it just depends on you know situation of what you're trying to do with it
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:42.860]  I mean that's it that's an interesting way of thinking of it is basically like if the material
[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:50.620]  is too oily to make dry sift and I mean honestly like you could you could make dry sift and then
[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:58.540]  squish that yeah yeah absolutely why would you ruin perfectly good dry sift well you're not
[01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:04.220]  you're improving it it's all preference man I was joking I personally don't really like to dab
[01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:11.100]  but I mean it's it's not just like dabbing but hash in general you know you could keep it as dry
[01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:15.580]  sift and you're gonna get a different effect out of it than when you press it you know when you
[01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:21.020]  press it you're gonna put other nuances into it with the heat and the pressure that makes other
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:26.860]  compounds versus what it is at its normal state I want to start like aging hash that's I've been
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:31.580]  saving trim and shit I want to do a good bubble hash run I want to make some dry sip too and I
[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:37.420]  want to just like store it have like some dry sip some ice water hash from like my different cultivars
[01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:42.220]  and then store that shit and let it age make some nice temple balls yeah temple balls are the way
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:47.500]  to go if you want if you want to store shit for long periods of time I like this mo cash and
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:52.140]  scissorhack dude I don't know if you ever stored like an aged scissor hash before but I love doing
[01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:58.140]  that too the fucking dogs ate my uh I had a two gram like huge ball of afgoo scissor hash when I
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:02.780]  got done trimming I didn't even get to smoke any of it because the fucking dogs got it I was going
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:06.860]  to store it for like four months before I smoked it it was the best scissor hash I've ever seen in
[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:14.620]  my life dude I was so sad like I almost cried man I was really sad like I didn't smoke any of the
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:19.580]  afgoo scissor hash because it it came off with like no plant material like all the shit I had
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:26.140]  on my hands and my scissors it was just perfectly black gooey as a motherfucker yeah no hairs like
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:31.180]  no pistols no plant material like I didn't have to sit and pick through it like when I trim I'll
[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:36.780]  pick the leaves off my fingers so that my scissor hash is better this shit was excellent and uh yeah
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:41.660]  I left it out when I went to sleep and the dogs got it but it was it was fucking killer even I
[01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:46.140]  did have it out for like a few days they didn't get it the first day and you know usually you'll
[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:51.020]  have some good scissor hash and when it's like gooey it'll be kind of like you know malleable
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:55.740]  but when you let it sit for a few days it'll dry and get hard this shit didn't get hard it just
[01:50:55.740 --> 01:50:59.820]  stayed real malleable and just like you could I could tell it was gonna be good
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:10.140]  yeah great day and age it's different consistencies consistencies of the rest of the you know and
[01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:14.940]  but like when when it you gotta think when the resin's in there like it's when it's in its all
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:19.980]  like it's encapsulated there's no oxygen and stuff getting inside of it that's like when you open up
[01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:24.540]  a temple ball I think of it as like a Reese's pieces you know like a Reese's peanut butter
[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:29.740]  more or less because it's it's darker on the outside that was oxidized and then you open it
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:35.260]  up the inside and it's just like peanut butter you know gooey fucking amazing fucking goodness
[01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:40.300]  on the inside like yeah I love temple balls like that you know break them open after a year or so
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:45.740]  you know they're fucking it's a great way to store it but your hash must be fucking
[01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:52.380]  in order you have to have that the hash has to be dry before you make a temple ball if not it will
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:52:03.340]  mold then you know it's it's done for so yeah come on yeah lay down come on dog's inside um
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:13.660]  yeah I mean so my um one of my mentors would take all of their outdoor
[01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:22.300]  use a keef tumbler tumble it and squish it out into rosin yeah and it looked
[01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:31.660]  very similar to people making bubble hash um making like you know hash rosin I mean it was
[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:40.300]  hash rosin but it looked very similar and I don't know dry sift rosin um and I mean but like to me
[01:52:41.100 --> 01:52:46.540]  it was potent and it was light in color and the text that consistently was slightly different but
[01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:52.700]  it was still you know what I mean good and to me yeah I mean it's it's it's gonna be darker because
[01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:57.820]  it's dry sift of course you know it had the time to cure but it also it's it's gonna have that time
[01:52:57.820 --> 01:53:04.620]  to cure so it's gonna have the nuances from the curing time as well versus a fresh frozen hash or
[01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:11.180]  something that was quick dried and wasn't really cured and it was just thrown in and pressed but
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:16.780]  you know that's the whole thing a beauty of of washing though as well is because you can also
[01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:23.100]  cure it and do other things after you press it as well and a lot of people don't understand as well
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:28.300]  is there's a lot of curing that goes involved with rosin after you press it and it just depends
[01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:33.820]  on what you do with that material on the next state of it some people don't do any you know
[01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:40.220]  some others uh will cold cure they'll do you know warm cure you know just room temperature curing
[01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:45.100]  um for like a week or two you know and just keep it in a mason jar sealed and they don't open it
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:50.700]  until that time comes because during that time the the pressure and everything from everything
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:56.780]  um bubbling off and whatnot it's it's putting pressure in the in the jar anyways and then
[01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:02.140]  that's why it's making it turn to butters and batters and other textures and things like that
[01:54:02.140 --> 01:54:15.020]  and nucleating yeah no for sure for sure i mean i don't know it's it's past my um
[01:54:15.660 --> 01:54:25.340]  i don't know i just focus on on growing it right yeah i mean that's what it is
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:35.500]  but i don't know i think i think being able to use sift being able to use a pollen tumbler
[01:54:35.660 --> 01:54:41.660]  a pollen tumbler to make rosin over bubble bags is
[01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:51.260]  would be extreme time saving energy all those things i'm not saying it would be better
[01:54:51.820 --> 01:54:58.700]  but it would be a lot more convenient way to make hash rosin because i have made bubble hash and i
[01:54:58.780 --> 01:55:06.380]  have made dry sift in the pollen tumbler and the tumbler is so much easier yeah absolutely i mean
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:13.020]  that's just it though i mean like when you're washing you have to have that room set up and
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:19.580]  everything's set up in place too and you know a freeze dryer is a huge thing like because you know
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:24.380]  if you're air drying hash it's you know it doesn't really work out too well i mean you could go buy a
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:28.780]  walk-in cooler but most people aren't gonna be doing all that you know they'll just go buy a
[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:36.140]  freeze dryer yeah i mean i guess freeze dryers are so expensive yes they are you know they're
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:42.380]  like three grand for a small one you know for with the pump and everything so yeah freeze dryers are
[01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:50.620]  not cheap at all so but they're they're well with the they're they are well worth the investment
[01:55:50.620 --> 01:56:02.540]  though you know so it's true it's true i mean how much is a gram of high-grade hash going for
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:08.460]  nowadays fifty dollars still oh but i mean on the black market i'm not sure anymore but like
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:12.620]  i at the dispo dude there's grams that go for like 120 bucks of like the
[01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:18.620]  fucking rosin and then i've seen like really good full melt it's like 80 90 bucks a gram
[01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:27.900]  i've never paid that i mean i've also seen the thing is dog days i've seen rosin here for like
[01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:35.100]  20 25 a gram at the dispo though you know but it is well yeah i've seen they have good shit at the
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:39.660]  dispo for cheap but i'm talking like high end prices they got some expensive shit nowadays
[01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:47.980]  yeah i mean i've seen i haven't seen no 120 but i don't you know um i've smoked some it was pretty
[01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:55.100]  fucking good my my homie that uh used to live in pueblo he would buy that shit from uh 710 labs
[01:56:55.100 --> 01:56:59.900]  he'd get all their like real high-end fucking stuff it was pretty good but like i'm not much
[01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:07.100]  of a dabber so honestly like i would rather buy a nine dollar gram of bho and 101 dollar bag of weed
[01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:14.460]  than 110 dollar gram of fucking rosin yeah i i i agree i i don't fucking i will not buy that
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:21.340]  fucking i won't i do like dab a little bit but like i love rosin but i'm not gonna um yeah i
[01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:29.260]  don't spend that kind of money on it you know you can still find good fire rosin for fucking
[01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:37.900]  cheap it's just you know the right people and you know things like that there's a question
[01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:46.140]  any tips for drying the bubble have drying the bubble without a freeze dryer um so i would say
[01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:52.140]  you know like lately what i've been doing since because i wash without a freeze dryer so i've been
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:58:00.300]  um i will um sieve the hash when it's wet after right after i collect it and i don't like i used
[01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:05.820]  to put it in a freezer for a certain amount of time and then i would sieve it with like a
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:12.380]  plating sieve um or planing it anyways and when you do that like with like with like a cheese
[01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:18.220]  grater type thing and you shred the hash like that it's you break up a lot of trichomes and it
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:23.980]  damages them so i've been um doing it when it's wet still so i collect it out of the bag and then
[01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:30.220]  i just put it through a mesh strainer um onto parchment and i um dry that on and then you can
[01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:38.300]  put that onto like baking sheets and and dry it that way i like using microfiber towels in between
[01:58:38.300 --> 01:58:44.540]  the baking sheets or in between the baking um crates anyways because they're because you use
[01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:52.380]  the the parchment and then you put um the fucking the microfiber towel underneath the parchment and
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:57.260]  then you put that you just set that on the shelf like a metal shelf is great so it has airflow
[01:58:57.260 --> 01:59:05.740]  underneath it as well it's going to be major um i dry in a a fridge a dedicated fridge though so
[01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:11.820]  um if you're air drying you could just make up like a little um put it in a box pretty much
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:17.820]  in a room and just keep it at like um you know as dry as possible for humidity wise
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:24.540]  and you know like below 70 degrees and and call it a day you know so you can you can dry it for
[01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:31.820]  you know like 48 hours it's just going to depend on um the environment on dry time and if you're not
[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:39.820]  sure on on drying like if you're not sure if it's fully dry yet just wait another day um french he's
[01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:44.220]  always he always used to tell me that he's like if you're not smelling the hash and if you're not
[01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:49.740]  smelling the terpenes coming off of it you're not having a problem so if you have to wait another
[01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:57.180]  extra day for it if you're not sure just give it an extra day um i also will switch in between um
[01:59:57.180 --> 02:00:04.540]  i will take the parchment um like 12 to 16 hours after i i put it on there and i'll replace the
[02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:10.380]  parchment and i'll receive it at the same time so you see it twice it makes it a lot more powdery
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:16.300]  so there's more surface area on the hash in order for you to sort for it to dry anyways
[02:00:17.180 --> 02:00:22.240]  hopefully that helps
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:34.880]  or to i'll simplify it get it into as many pieces as possible the more pieces that it's in yeah the
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:41.200]  more surface area it has the you know the less chance it's gonna have to um mold on you you know
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:48.960]  and it's got more surface area to dry so it's absolutely yeah the more pieces it's in and people
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:59.120]  have been debating for decades regarding these various texts and these various texts is what
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:09.920]  differentiates lots of different people in their art of this process and that's from somebody
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:16.480]  looking out looking in because when i see these aspects i'm not like oh this is cool i'm just like
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:24.080]  ugh like i can totally fuck this shit up with like this aspect of it you know what i mean like
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:29.760]  but i see like you i see like you know what i mean all these people who like know about this
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:36.560]  shit and they geek out about these processes so it's not like something to just look over like oh
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:42.560]  how do you dry hash like drying hash is like drying weed like imagine if you can't dry weed and you're
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:48.400]  just like you know i don't really like to focus on drying weed i don't really know much about
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:55.280]  drying weed obviously my weed would be terrible but like right yeah absolutely you know that's
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:02:02.000]  that's just the two so yeah so it's like it's a whole skill of people who just learn how to dry
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:11.120]  their hash properly hence why i like dry sift because it's not even adding that aspect of water
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:17.920]  to the equation there is no drying like the hardest parts of it you don't even have to do
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:26.080]  um but i agree well i mean but you had to do do that in flower though you you're having to do
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:34.960]  um a drying point at some point of it and say if you would just do um like a quick dry
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:41.840]  um for like seven eight seven to nine days um freeze it in the bags you didn't spend any time
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:48.640]  trimming and you know you just cut it up a little bit pretty much and put it in the bags and i like
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:56.480]  when i put it in the freezer um i will leave the bags opened um until they are solid until the buds
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:02.160]  are frozen and then i will steal them because it leaves um it lets moisture go out of the bags so
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:08.080]  you're not having ice crystals and shit like that form on the bag while it's while it's um
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:15.360]  freezing anyways i mean i think when you're talking about the the partial dry i think that's
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:22.320]  the future for everybody who uh doesn't have a freeze dryer quick drying you mean yeah
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:31.120]  i mean the thing is like i know i know people that still do quick dry even with freeze dryers though
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:40.400]  um so you know it's just a quick way to get the plant to to the the next stage with having to wait
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:46.880]  i don't feel like doing anything quick during that process is good i feel like like when it comes to
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:52.560]  the drying and the curing like you just spent months growing out a plant i'm not doing anything
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:04:00.800]  to try to skim a couple of days off the process i agree i agree you know it's it's a different
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:06.720]  process and a way of drying it so like you're not you're not cheating yourself or anything but
[02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:12.720]  you're not gonna like i've been i've said before you're not you're not gonna quick dry when you're
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:18.960]  smoking the flower like by any means it doesn't it's not gonna like have any negative effects
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:25.840]  on the return on your hash or like the quality or anything though like no no it's it's just about
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:31.920]  getting the the resin brittle pretty much in order for it to easily fall off the plant so it
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:39.600]  can be harvested into rosin to the next stage you know so no it doesn't it doesn't do that
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:44.720]  i've been wanting to do something kind of like you can't test that like i want to cure some weed
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:50.160]  like dry it and cure it and have it like like cured good and proper for a good few months like
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:55.440]  i would smoking flower and make some hash out of that and then like make some hash out of some
[02:04:55.440 --> 02:05:00.800]  fresher material and then like cure the hash and so i'll have you know what i mean to like see if
[02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:06.000]  the see if it affects it differently like if it cures if those heads cure on the flower as opposed
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:10.880]  to curing in a ball of hash if it's going to affect the high and how it ends up they're going
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:15.920]  to be two totally different things i mean it's it's going to be a night and day difference you're
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:19.920]  gonna it's going to be like a different plant for you pretty much is is what the different what the
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:25.360]  results are going to be for you um which is amazing because you know you could just do so many little
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:30.800]  things to make get all these different results with the same plant too so you know that's just
[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:45.020]  it with like with hash too so what are you smoking in diva um i had um i had whatever left dog days
[02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:51.340]  had he gave me i think it was um well i did a little bit of everything i gave you mostly um i
[02:05:51.340 --> 02:05:55.900]  think it was the lucky charms and that spirit train that you like well i still have both of
[02:05:55.900 --> 02:06:01.180]  those left and it was the other that other jar so it's like the primus and whatever else the
[02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:08.300]  the after was the little frosty buds yeah i had some of that and then i mixed it with the purple
[02:06:08.300 --> 02:06:15.820]  punch i had i had a little bit of that so so somebody is saying um it seems like it would
[02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:28.140]  have a low shelf life um no because okay so shelf life is all gonna depend on well here and
[02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:32.780]  oxidation pretty much right well here let me let me jump in i mean i would also say like
[02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:40.540]  you know like terpenes are highly volatile absolutely and like so basically like
[02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:46.940]  you know things if you want things to be loud you need to keep them in a certain type of
[02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:54.540]  environment if you keep them in the proper environment they have a pretty nice shelf life
[02:06:54.540 --> 02:07:04.140]  like a freezer like a freezer like a freezer in a vacuum sealed um you know or even in a fridge
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:09.580]  like in the right container yeah i mean a fridge does work but a freezer for longevity wise you
[02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:15.660]  can keep hash like rosin for example you can keep that shit in the freezer for a fucking over a
[02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:23.580]  year and be fine as long as it's you know actually no oxygen or anything getting to it you know as
[02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:28.700]  long as it's in a vacuum sealed bag or container you're fine but i like using bags so like i put
[02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:34.860]  mine i'll put my rosin in parchment and then i put it in a vacuum sealed bag and i vacuum steal it
[02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:39.980]  so then it's small little in the freezer it's easy to store and you don't have to worry about
[02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:48.460]  it you know yeah and then like for example like if you have um let's say like some temple balls or
[02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:55.180]  something like that like you know personally i have mine that like can heat up a little bit and
[02:07:55.180 --> 02:08:00.700]  cool down i don't like keep it in the fridge i'm like allowing it to slowly oxidize and whatever
[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:08.060]  temple balls are kind of a little different story like i leave i will still leave mine out like in
[02:08:08.060 --> 02:08:13.100]  room temperature like in my basement anyways i don't want to say room temperature but in my
[02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:18.780]  basement dark cold place anyways um and i put it like in a mason jar you know keep it sealed
[02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:24.780]  and you know that's how i i keep my temple yeah me too i don't do temple balls for for in the half
[02:08:24.860 --> 02:08:32.140]  for um in the freezer in the fridge wise yeah but that's just me you know so yeah yeah but like
[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:37.420]  rosin wise for sure like i have rosin in my you know i keep rosin in my freezer all the fucking
[02:08:37.420 --> 02:08:42.140]  time yeah and i mean even like and like i don't know if this person was just like trolling or not
[02:08:42.140 --> 02:08:48.300]  but i mean it's honestly a good question um jars are no no no i said no i said i know if this person
[02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:53.420]  was was trolling or not i was just it was a good question no somebody else has a question about
[02:08:53.420 --> 02:08:59.420]  jars and i was just saying like mason jars um i my personal favorites are myron glass jars
[02:08:59.420 --> 02:09:05.020]  temporary they have small like little one ounce ones so you can keep for hash and shits and which
[02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:10.540]  is the ones i like anyways but they have bigger ones too so i have i use both um i have different
[02:09:10.540 --> 02:09:16.860]  sizes of them but i like those for like that type of storage but uh mainly you know for like i'd
[02:09:16.860 --> 02:09:21.500]  rather just use a vacuum sealed bag and some parchment to be honest with you for for i love
[02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:28.860]  weed for weed for rosin wise yeah those ones are uh you're talking about weed and in general i mean
[02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:34.060]  you definitely like it's good to have different size containers like as the amount of material
[02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:38.700]  leaves you know what i mean because you don't want to have like air in the middle but i mean you're
[02:09:38.700 --> 02:09:43.740]  smoking that shit so quick it'll be done right i mean that's just it too like you know you smoke
[02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:48.860]  fucking the hash tastes so good you smoke it too fast you know it's hard to save so there's not a
[02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:55.020]  whole lot of lastage to to go about it but the thing is is water hash does last long you just
[02:09:56.460 --> 02:10:00.940]  you just have to know how to store it properly and it has to have been stored from the start
[02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:05.020]  like that because like if it's already been nucleated the damage has already been done
[02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:09.180]  you know like i mean you could still store it it's going to stay in that state but i mean it's not
[02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:14.140]  going to be at like the best state that it was you know like you could store it at that i mean i can
[02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:23.500]  bring over a jar of like six or seven year old bubble hash that i have right now i mean like if
[02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:29.980]  your stomach really hurts and you smoke it it has this really interesting stomach effect and it tastes
[02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:37.100]  really kind of like incensey um and it does the job if i had nothing to smoke and you smoke it'll
[02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:46.620]  get you high um yeah i mean i don't know i would say hash does preserve really well yes it does
[02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:52.140]  you know and it's all type of hash too you know it's not just i mean temple balls i would say
[02:10:52.140 --> 02:10:57.500]  probably temple balls are probably going to be the your best bet for long-term storage if you
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:11:02.940]  want to just store hash that's out in the open you don't have to put it in a freezer or anything
[02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:09.020]  like that just keep it in a vacuum sealed you know jar or container or bag whatever you got and
[02:11:09.020 --> 02:11:15.100]  in you know leave it there you know like as long as it's not in the open and it's you know getting
[02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:19.260]  sunlight to it just leave it in the back of a cabinet or something you'll be fine you know
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:25.760]  yeah microdosing has been amazing too
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:31.600]  oh yeah i forgot we were talking about that you yeah so i've been doing that since i went home
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:36.960]  and from seeing you like it on the on the drive home i ate like uh i only ate like a f****** gram
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:44.640]  when i left your place and drove home that's too much i usually eat a quarter always so no no i'm
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:49.440]  saying for microdosing wise oh no i wasn't for the drive home i didn't want to microdose i wanted to
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:54.800]  have like a nice little trip but not be too f****** up eating a gram was almost too much to drive home
[02:11:54.800 --> 02:12:00.080]  on it was it was just enough to have a great time but then since then i've been eating just like a
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:06.320]  small cap and like a couple little pieces of stuff every other day and uh i'm really liking
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:12.480]  it's helping me get sleep like i'm i'm getting better sleeping patterns i'm having more dreams
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:16.880]  i'm getting better quality sleep and i have more energy throughout the day yeah that's what i'm
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:22.320]  saying like it gives me f****** energy it helps my mood like it's it's f****** wonderful for chronic
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:28.560]  pain like i f****** like microdosing for my chronic pain yeah my hand is dude my hand is doing way
[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:33.440]  better it healed up almost all the way it's just the bones are broken and s*** but the like the
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:40.080]  flesh wounds are pretty good i pulled my stitches out myself jamal what you got there f****** throwing
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:47.280]  things at everybody today yeah that weed you got some scissor cleaner in your keyboard what else
[02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:54.080]  you got going on this is something that this is some like six or seven year old hash
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:13:02.880]  oh yeah right on nice yeah that looks good
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:09.280]  yeah i mean that's that's straight that's just it though that's that's smoking hash you know like
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:16.080]  you know like smoking hash is gonna last a lot longer than than dabbing hashes you know like
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:22.160]  you know that's just it you know like but there's there's no one to say you know you can't say that
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:28.080]  you couldn't use the the dabbing hash to smoke the hash with it anyways after you know if it gets
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:38.240]  too old to dab more or less then you could just is that like some resin type oil um old old rosin
[02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:44.640]  so like that type of stuff that's what i use for edibles bro yeah like that's what i like i like
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:52.240]  decarbing that i'll put it on like a um a heated um mixing plate with a little ceramic stir in it
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:57.680]  and f****** just let that s*** go and f****** decarb it and then you can f****** infuse it with whatever
[02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:03.200]  you want and like people are saying earlier like oh you know hash is too strong for edibles and
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:09.280]  blah blah blah it's it's about the dosage so you know take a little bit about it and you know you'll
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:18.880]  be fine yeah it's true this is my board dog the thing is is like i like using hash better for for
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:25.280]  edibles because you're not tasting like the deep carb like the the taste you get when when you
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:30.720]  decarb the flour always like i've always had that with edibles i've always you know usually you
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:37.440]  always get some type of you know taste from it and like i just i find it so much easier to make
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:43.840]  hash edibles with it especially with all the extra s*** i have so you know and it's great for
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:50.640]  like the 190 the 160 in your 25 bags you can use for food grade and then you're not throwing nothing
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:56.080]  away and even your 220 if you know like some people they wash their 220 enough it looks nice
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:02.640]  like you know so yeah you can still wash it enough to to make it food grade anyways it just depends
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:07.200]  on quality and the size of the trichomes like some plants you're not going to be able to do that with
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:12.000]  and some you can some can't you know it's just it's all going to depend on the size of those
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:17.760]  those heads so when i get this afgoo back i've got a buddy that i'm getting it back from and
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:22.720]  i can't f****** wait because i think it's going to be a great little hash plant just like from
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:27.520]  my experience of all the key for the scissor hash i got from it like trimming and then the amount of
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:32.240]  like teeth that it dropped while i was trimming through the trim bin i really want to like try
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:40.240]  to make some hash with it yeah afgoo will dump yeah it's just it's also oily though as well yeah
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:47.440]  that's just it though like it it was more of a bho plant uh you know like it makes better bho and co2
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:53.440]  extractions and that's just that certain plants if they're oily that's why they they blast well
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:16:00.000]  you know that's why you know it was still prevalent you know in the game because they could get you
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.120]  know they were still getting a lot more higher numbers out of bho and co2 than you do out of
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:11.600]  washington wise but that's like well-made co2 extracted i was just gonna say why did co2 go
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:18.800]  away i really like yeah i like nabby co2 and i mean i used to get co2 cartridges man when i lived
[02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:24.240]  in utah they were full spectrum oil like they had it was a full cannabinoid profile it wasn't just
[02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:31.040]  isolated distillate and they were they were they would range from about 72 to 82 percent thc
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:35.680]  but they would also give me the cbd level on them i can't i don't know where homie was getting them
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:40.400]  but they were legit he had to have been going to like a legit marketplace to get them but they were
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:47.040]  really nice man they tasted like like uh i had like gorilla glue and fucking uh og you know i
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:51.600]  had a bunch of different strains and those are the only cards i've had in my life where like
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:58.240]  i'm dead ass positive that they actually were what they said like i had a i had some gorilla
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:03.920]  glue five flower and i had gorilla glue five carts and they tasted the fucking same dude like
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:09.360]  they were actually unique to the cultivar they said they were for sure and i mean i had a i had
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:17.120]  a friend who like who really was a skilled grower and when they had their co2 oil extracted they
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:22.240]  people said it was like some of the best they had ever you know had ever made you know and that
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:28.400]  really you know that basically you know that told me okay like the the quality is really coming
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:36.640]  through you know i had some of their pens and their pens were amazing and the thing with co2 was
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:45.120]  um just the setup wise it costs so much more to have a co2 setup and to keep it running
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:52.960]  versus a bho setup is i what i think it went away um you know i mean it's still around they still
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:58.720]  have you know there's still co2 out there and shit but i mean it's it's you know it's getting
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:08.430]  down to you know negligible anyways that's around here anyways so yeah that's that's a bummer i've
[02:18:08.430 --> 02:18:14.910]  had some but you know that's just it though with hash though like you know rosen why is like it's
[02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:21.870]  expensive because you don't get a great return on it like you do you know five seven percent return
[02:18:21.870 --> 02:18:31.230]  versus 15 20 like they used to do for you know bho co2 numbers and shit you know what's that
[02:18:32.670 --> 02:18:47.090]  some bike press tash from last year um try the bottom of it yeah there you go
[02:18:47.650 --> 02:18:54.210]  i mean it's not crazy by no means it's just like what i'm aging or whatever yeah
[02:18:58.930 --> 02:19:05.410]  but yeah so but i still don't understand why the co2 oil is not around you're just saying it's just
[02:19:05.410 --> 02:19:13.330]  cheaper to make distillate i see it sometimes but yeah that that would be my guess that's what like
[02:19:13.650 --> 02:19:17.890]  all the f****** carts started going to distillate and that's
[02:19:17.890 --> 02:19:25.250]  i don't even like this personally it sucks this looks terrible well yes but so like i i don't
[02:19:25.250 --> 02:19:31.010]  f*** with distillate either and there's 90 of cartridges are distillate but they are they do
[02:19:31.010 --> 02:19:37.490]  have rosin carts too now so yeah those look good you know i've had a couple of those they're not
[02:19:37.490 --> 02:19:43.810]  too bad but yeah i i don't do carts usually so i mean i i like doing them once in a while but
[02:19:46.050 --> 02:19:53.090]  there you go i mean these shop like kick a** dude these are 20 f******
[02:19:53.090 --> 02:20:00.690]  shop lights from walmart these are 45 watts each i like them i got uh 30 watts when i clone under
[02:20:00.690 --> 02:20:08.690]  usually is that is that your mother this is all my mom's dude i got f****** 18 of them in here
[02:20:08.690 --> 02:20:15.330]  all in solos this is my sour i got my sour next to the east coast sour diesel and they're starting
[02:20:15.330 --> 02:20:21.090]  to look a lot more similar that east coast sour was a little underfed and whatnot these lights
[02:20:21.090 --> 02:20:27.410]  are powerful dude but have you guys used any of those grove bags i i've been i need to get some
[02:20:28.370 --> 02:20:34.130]  for sure i don't use none of that s*** dude i what i do is i just make sure i dry and cure my
[02:20:34.130 --> 02:20:40.290]  s*** properly and i get it into a jar and i just i f****** smoke it i can store my weed in a big jar
[02:20:40.290 --> 02:20:45.730]  for three four or five months like i'm going on like a couple months right now and my stuff's
[02:20:45.730 --> 02:20:53.170]  still bomb but i do not like the humidifier packs i don't like the technology i don't trust it
[02:20:54.050 --> 02:20:59.410]  understood i'm talking about the grove bags they're yeah no they have that like turplock
[02:20:59.410 --> 02:21:04.530]  technology is what they call it i got i got i got one with a fish s*** sample and i just i
[02:21:04.530 --> 02:21:09.570]  really didn't like it either it seems to be a very similar kind of idea yeah i mean they do
[02:21:09.570 --> 02:21:14.530]  have you know they have the the built-in um hygrometer bags and i'm pretty much the packs
[02:21:14.530 --> 02:21:19.570]  that under built into the the bags anyways they look they have another ones that are called uh
[02:21:19.570 --> 02:21:26.130]  huma locks i think is another company like i i f****** hate bovita but yeah i don't f*** with
[02:21:26.130 --> 02:21:30.770]  bovita don't put me in a room with a bovita spokesman because i'll f****** have it out with
[02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:37.810]  them they that s*** ruined it ruined a f****** jar of trinity bro and if you if your humidipax
[02:21:37.810 --> 02:21:43.010]  can ruin the flavor on a jar of trinity you should not be selling them to people that's
[02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:47.970]  for candidates like trinity is some of the best tasting weed man and you have to you have to be
[02:21:47.970 --> 02:21:54.290]  f****** up to ruin that s*** well that's all salt-based that's all salt-based um hygrometer
[02:21:54.290 --> 02:22:00.610]  bags do that though it's not just bovita bags like i'm a big fan of the integra bags personally but
[02:22:00.610 --> 02:22:05.490]  yeah you were telling me about those i might try them but probably won't i just i'm just i'm just
[02:22:05.490 --> 02:22:10.290]  i'm real anal about how i do things and i just try my best to jar it when it's still good and
[02:22:10.850 --> 02:22:19.090]  and not open it too much and whatnot well i i need to jump in um one i know one of the bovita
[02:22:19.890 --> 02:22:26.290]  salespeople and oh s*** i want to say i want to say she she's awesome
[02:22:27.090 --> 02:22:32.050]  no i was kidding more than anything i don't like them though yeah my god doesn't mean she's i mean
