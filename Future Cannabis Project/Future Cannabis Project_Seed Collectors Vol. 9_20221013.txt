[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We just started
[01:30.580 --> 01:33.080]  See the heat, heat, heat, heat from your body
[01:33.580 --> 01:35.080]  She's a thorn in my side
[01:35.580 --> 01:37.080]  Oh my! Oh my! Oh my!
[01:37.580 --> 01:39.080]  My love is just a newbie
[01:39.580 --> 01:41.080]  Oh my! Oh my! Oh my!
[01:41.580 --> 01:43.080]  My love is just a newbie
[01:43.580 --> 01:45.080]  Oh my! Oh my! Oh my!
[01:45.580 --> 01:47.080]  My love is just a newbie
[01:48.580 --> 01:50.080]  Just a newbie
[01:50.080 --> 01:52.080]  My friend, how are you?
[01:52.080 --> 01:54.080]  God, God, God
[01:54.080 --> 01:56.080]  My friend, how are you?
[01:56.080 --> 01:58.080]  God, God, God
[01:58.080 --> 02:00.080]  My boyfriend, how are you?
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  Oh, everybody, I gotta take off me there. Yay!
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  Oh, you're good. You're good.
[02:34.000 --> 02:36.000]  I was fuckin' with it.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  Getting down, getting jiggy with it.
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.000]  Oh yeah, I did. Hell yeah.
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.000]  That's what happens when an audio engineer gets baked and mishears lyrics.
[02:46.000 --> 02:50.000]  I swear it was saying, daga, daga, daga, Peter, you're a Casanova.
[02:50.000 --> 02:52.000]  And I rolled with it.
[02:52.000 --> 03:00.000]  Hell yeah, dude. It's like Bad Moon, you know, with Cregan's Clearwater Revival.
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Sounds like Japan. There's a bathroom on the right.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  Totally, totally nailed it.
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  There's a whole lot of awesome misheard lyrics out there.
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  I'm sure, I thought I misheard Dick Soup earlier, but that's apparently a real artist.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  Oh dude, that's a real one, man. Dick Soup, Ball City.
[03:20.000 --> 03:26.000]  Dick Trickle, professional NASCAR driver, is probably his brother.
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  Maybe a cousin. I don't know. With names like that, you probably have to be cousins, don't you think?
[03:30.000 --> 03:36.000]  Maybe. The band, there was Banjo and Sullivan was the band for that one.
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  They wrote it back in like the 70s too, so it was cool.
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.000]  Oh man. Well, speaking of music, I totally pulled the move.
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  I pulled the move. All right, check me out, guys.
[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  I fucking wore the t-shirt of the band I was going to see.
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  I actually did this. Yes.
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  Dude, that's awesome, dude. That's awesome.
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  I did the same thing.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  You did? What do you got there?
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  Oh, well, it's...
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  Oh, there we go. Okay. You don't have to stand up.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  I mean, I could if you want, but I'm not wearing any pants.
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  I don't know how your crowd is, you know what I mean?
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  Maybe they want some dick soup.
[04:20.000 --> 04:26.000]  You know what? That's not child appropriate.
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  Oh, yeah. That's true, man.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  You got that little super chat shit where they give you money or whatever.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  You just kick everybody under 18 out.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  You know what I mean? You just got to put that music back on.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  That's the only deal.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  We can start an OnlyFans for you.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  Yeah, well, that's already going down.
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  We're going to play like horno music and pollinate plants and shit.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  Slow motion. It's got to be slow motion.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, for sure.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  And we'll be like, oh, fuck yeah.
[04:59.000 --> 05:02.000]  Fucking pollinate like crazy.
[05:02.000 --> 05:06.000]  Got to be like that guy, dropping fucking loads.
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  Yeah, man. Fucking...
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  I guess this would be the crowd for it too.
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  A bunch of like CEDO files and shit, you know?
[05:14.000 --> 05:18.000]  Yes. Yeah, we get comments like this all the time.
[05:18.000 --> 05:21.000]  I need seeds. Can you help me, please?
[05:21.000 --> 05:23.000]  Hell yeah. Hell yeah.
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  I know Dave, he's got his out.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  I broke out the old...
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  Damn.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  The old satchel there.
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  He's hiding them in a happy birthday balloon.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  Yeah. Yeah, they'll never know.
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  Just fill it with fucking helium and string it up.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  They're probably light enough.
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  I'm sure they would float.
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.000]  Yeah, that, don't worry about it.
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  That's just a weather balloon.
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  What's going on here?
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  Not doing anything wrong.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  Nothing to see here.
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  Please move on.
[05:58.000 --> 06:02.000]  Just a birthday party with a bunch of grown ass men.
[06:02.000 --> 06:03.000]  We like balloons.
[06:03.000 --> 06:06.000]  I've got nothing for you, officer, except for some dick soup.
[06:06.000 --> 06:08.000]  What's up?
[06:08.000 --> 06:10.000]  Fuck out of here.
[06:10.000 --> 06:12.000]  Oh shit, man.
[06:12.000 --> 06:13.000]  I love it.
[06:13.000 --> 06:15.000]  No helicopter action, please.
[06:15.000 --> 06:16.000]  Okay. Yes, David.
[06:16.000 --> 06:17.000]  No helicopter action.
[06:17.000 --> 06:19.000]  And I know the helicopter you're talking about.
[06:19.000 --> 06:21.000]  So we'll stay away from that tonight.
[06:21.000 --> 06:23.000]  But I did have to...
[06:23.000 --> 06:24.000]  Yeah.
[06:24.000 --> 06:27.000]  I did have to stand up and represent though.
[06:27.000 --> 06:30.000]  On the front of your shirt is what's on the back of my...
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  Nice.
[06:32.000 --> 06:33.000]  Yeah, man.
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  Nice, because every time I saw you, I would always be like,
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  so when's the merch coming out?
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  When's the t-shirts coming out?
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  But you've got them out now, right?
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  Made it happen, man.
[06:44.000 --> 06:45.000]  Made it fucking happen.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  Shirts and hoodies, man.
[06:47.000 --> 06:49.000]  Next, I got to do beanies, man.
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  I got to get the beanies and the hats ready.
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  And like a thicker hoodie too, you know, for the winter winter.
[06:55.000 --> 06:56.000]  Yeah.
[06:56.000 --> 06:57.000]  You're an East Coast winner.
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.000]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  You need like the pull over fucking the solid thick hoodie for that shit, man.
[07:03.000 --> 07:04.000]  Yeah.
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.000]  Well, I, you know, that last episode, I'm actually kind of faux pawing too.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  I wore the shirt two episodes in a row.
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  But again, I wanted to wear the t-shirt of the band I was going to see tonight.
[07:15.000 --> 07:16.000]  But Dave didn't have it.
[07:16.000 --> 07:23.000]  So I was going to help you out here, Dave, and anybody who's watching too.
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  RVA threads.
[07:25.000 --> 07:26.000]  This is where, let me scroll.
[07:26.000 --> 07:27.000]  Let me scroll.
[07:27.000 --> 07:28.000]  This is what you got here.
[07:28.000 --> 07:33.000]  You got your t-shirts, your hoodie zip.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  I love that it's a zip up too.
[07:35.000 --> 07:36.000]  That's important.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  And then the shirt that I'm sporting right here.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  And that was just the RVA threads website.
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  If anybody wants to check that out, definitely go hit that up.
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.000]  And I just put that up there because I'm pretty damn stoked with this.
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  I've already gotten compliments on it.
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.000]  And I'm like, I know you don't know, but you just liked it anyway.
[07:55.000 --> 07:56.000]  So that's cool.
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.000]  Exactly.
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  And I used to tell my friends, be like, yeah, they'll get you laid or whatever.
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  And it actually happened in a few cases.
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.000]  And then my other friends are married, and they're like, but I already get laid.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  I'm like, but did you stop getting laid?
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.000]  No.
[08:10.000 --> 08:11.000]  No, you didn't.
[08:11.000 --> 08:12.000]  No.
[08:12.000 --> 08:18.000]  So is that a money back guarantee thing in the fine print there?
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  On the laid action?
[08:21.000 --> 08:22.000]  Yeah.
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  No, I can't work miracles in all cases.
[08:25.000 --> 08:26.000]  You know what I mean?
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  60% of the time it works every time.
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  That's right, man.
[08:30.000 --> 08:31.000]  That's right.
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  Yeah, you know the deal.
[08:33.000 --> 08:34.000]  Oh, shit.
[08:34.000 --> 08:40.000]  Well, Dave, I see you've already got a couple of those logos lurking down there too.
[08:40.000 --> 08:47.000]  And I want to know or let everybody in chat know too, if you guys have some of your favorite Dominion Seed Company seeds,
[08:47.000 --> 08:52.000]  and you got some questions, definitely let us know, and I'll be keeping track of that.
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.000]  Maybe we get some inside knowledge or information from you, Duke.
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[08:59.000 --> 09:00.000]  That would be awesome.
[09:00.000 --> 09:06.000]  You know, honestly, and Dave can probably show it off here, but a lot of times on the back of your packs,
[09:06.000 --> 09:12.000]  you give some pretty good details and some pretty good information about the strains, kind of what to expect,
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  kind of how to treat them, if they're going to be picky bitch or not.
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  That I absolutely love.
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.000]  One, it's a big help to growers.
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  But, you know, it also shows, I mean, right there, the top thing, morphology.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  It also shows that you've grown these out.
[09:29.000 --> 09:35.000]  So can you maybe speak to the importance of doing that kind of stuff with seeds as a breeder?
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  Yeah, it's pretty important for like a variety of reasons.
[09:42.000 --> 09:54.000]  One, you don't want to put something out there that's going to be shit, you know, because that's just not cool.
[09:54.000 --> 10:04.000]  And two, not everything always works out, you know, so you could have a real hermaphroditic mess going on.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  Totally uncool as well.
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.000]  Also, it's good to be able to pass on that information to who's growing it,
[10:13.000 --> 10:19.000]  because whether they've been growing a hundred years or this is their very first grow,
[10:19.000 --> 10:28.000]  any added data to help them get to know that plant before they get to grow it is going to be a big help.
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  And it might dictate whether or not they're going to buy it or not.
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  They might be so limited on vertical space, you know, and these things are like real stretchers.
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.000]  So they might say, well, maybe that's not right for me.
[10:42.000 --> 10:51.000]  Or they might say, yeah, I'll get the females here and then I'll take cuttings and force flower cuttings or something,
[10:51.000 --> 10:53.000]  you know, to make it work in their space.
[10:53.000 --> 11:01.000]  But to go in totally blind like that, you know, it could potentially ruin some good times, you know.
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.000]  And I'm trying to make good times, not fuck them up, you know.
[11:07.000 --> 11:12.000]  No, dude, totally a good point, because I do that as well.
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  I try to keep everything like around 60 days.
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  That's just my rotation. And, you know, if something's a 12 week or it may be amazing,
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  but it just doesn't necessarily have a place in my garden.
[11:26.000 --> 11:33.000]  So knowing those things, especially, you know, on a smaller level like myself, that helps because you're trying to just constantly flip.
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.000]  And if the rotation gets fucked up, then all of a sudden you got plants that are in lights and, you know.
[11:39.000 --> 11:41.000]  Yeah, it's no good, man.
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  And like I was always like trying to get the right thing to the right people for what they need.
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  And like I'll totally talk somebody out of getting something.
[11:49.000 --> 11:55.000]  They might be ready to buy it, but I know that's not going to necessarily fit in their schedule or something.
[11:55.000 --> 11:58.000]  And I'll totally talk them out of buying it.
[11:58.000 --> 12:05.000]  You know, I'll refer them elsewhere, you know, if I know something better exists, you know, for what they're trying to achieve.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  It's kind of I appreciate that. It's kind of crazy in a sense.
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.000]  It's like it's that honesty of losing a sale is actually in my mind what makes me go back to a person.
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  Just because they were actually looking out for me.
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  So, you know, I like to support those kind of people.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  So that's cool, man. That's good to see.
[12:26.000 --> 12:33.000]  And I know a lot of people have been able to reach out to you and see you at some of these shows and get the inside scoop.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  So hats off to that.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  Dave, have you ever reached out? Have you ever had questions?
[12:38.000 --> 12:44.000]  What are you growing here? Are any of these actually popped or are these still in the bank?
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  They're all still in the bank currently.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  This would be the first one that's going to be popped.
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.000]  Although I did want to pop this Lone Star White Widow Cindy 99 that I got from you.
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  But I really think that the Dominion should be the first pop.
[12:58.000 --> 13:10.000]  OK, now, one thing that I kind of, you know, just overall consensus is there's a lot of strength in your strains, cultivars.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  We could go either way with this.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  And there's also a lot of gas.
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  Is that where does Dominion skunk kind of fall into that?
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  Maybe I don't know if you could tell us a little backstory about the parents or how it kind of came to be.
[13:25.000 --> 13:30.000]  Yeah, I was I was making it for like further, further projects.
[13:30.000 --> 13:37.000]  And I'd gone to the Emerald Cup and I didn't have a whole lot of the seeds anyway.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  Not the precursors to all that.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  And people were going to shit over it.
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  And I was like, well, you know, only got so much and they're gone.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  And like, I'm sorry.
[13:47.000 --> 13:56.000]  So I'm going through my dominion skunk on doing everything and finding the right boy to further these these projects along.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  And people would not stop bugging me.
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.000]  Like and I was like, well, I don't really necessarily want to put that out there.
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000]  You know, it's for a stop.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  But people wouldn't leave me alone.
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  And I got talked into it by a good 20 people that were just like, you know, the fucker.
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  So it's like, all right, you know, put it put it out there.
[14:17.000 --> 14:31.000]  That one you got you got more of a range from like you're like you're burnt rubber, like a skunk spray to even like a like a sweet sour chem, you know, and like blends of all the above and everything.
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  So super good, real potent, real potent.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  Real good outdoor growing plant to good strong branching and all.
[14:41.000 --> 14:51.000]  That's another thing that I always look for that's important to sometimes those finicky ones, you know, if I have to do a lot of work to keep them strong or, you know, they need a lot of special attention.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  They can never be that plant in the back.
[14:54.000 --> 15:00.000]  So, yeah, big, strong, robust frame definitely goes a long way in my tent as well.
[15:00.000 --> 15:12.000]  Yeah, man. Yeah, I'm a big, you know, if that's something that's achievable, I definitely want it to be able to hold itself up and very minimal, you know, staking supporting or whatnot.
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  You know, I always like to shoot for that if I can.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  Yeah. So so which ones, Dave, have you popped?
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  Have you popped any of the Dominion gear?
[15:22.000 --> 15:30.000]  The only thing of Duke's I've ever had the chance to pop so far yet was the Cindy 99 to Cindy 99 S1s.
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.000]  That was that was really nice.
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.000]  That was just killer pineapple, rotten fruit, rotten tropical fruit.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  Just a really pleasant uplifting high.
[15:40.000 --> 15:41.000]  Definitely a real winner.
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  It was something that made me have to pop on those.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  The Lone Star, White Widow, Cindy 99 Femmes.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  That's the reason I went so hog wild for those.
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  But I am a fan of the gas, the cam, the rank, the nasty.
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.000]  So that's kind of what had my eyes on Duke's gear for the for the longest time.
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  So just using that building block of his, I think, would be a good starting point.
[16:07.000 --> 16:08.000]  Not that these wouldn't be as well.
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  Everything here is going to be a killer.
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  But I think I just think that would be the best.
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.000]  Yeah. Yeah.
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  That one and that burnout, those are nasty.
[16:19.000 --> 16:20.000]  Very, very nasty for sure.
[16:21.000 --> 16:22.000]  You're going to be happy, dude, Dave.
[16:23.000 --> 16:24.000]  That's what I like to hear.
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  And a lot of your gear, is it regular seeds or do you...
[16:31.000 --> 16:32.000]  The majority of it is.
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  Yeah, I've dealt into some Feminaz projects.
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  And, you know, it's like for everything that you see getting released, you know,
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.000]  there's a lot of stuff that doesn't.
[16:44.000 --> 16:47.000]  And reason being is like it didn't cut the mustard.
[16:48.000 --> 16:49.000]  It doesn't didn't work as intended.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  Like it was good, but it wasn't great.
[16:53.000 --> 16:54.000]  You know, right. Yeah.
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  Yeah. So it just goes goes the way side, you know,
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  Feminaz was like that, too.
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  You know, some things work out exceptional, other things, you know, not so much.
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  But those they share in 99s, man.
[17:10.000 --> 17:16.000]  They were like the one, man, it has a C-99 fucking structure of it.
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.000]  Doubles in height, high, high bractol leaf ratio.
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.000]  The leaves will turn almost black looking, you know,
[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  and the resin has like that silver sheen on it, like nice fat fucking colors.
[17:31.000 --> 17:36.000]  And it'll smell like fucking like remember the ice, the high C ecto cooler.
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  Yeah.
[17:38.000 --> 17:39.000]  You know what I'm talking about?
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  Yeah. Smells and tastes like that shit.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  How do you feel on a fucking weird, dude?
[17:46.000 --> 17:47.000]  All weirded out.
[17:48.000 --> 17:49.000]  I still look for that.
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  The ecto cooler from I see, man.
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.000]  They brought it back for a minute, but it was one of those stupid like people
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.000]  hoarded it type shit and sold it for like 200 a case on eBay.
[18:00.000 --> 18:01.000]  Oh, shit.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.000]  Dave's got the weed, man.
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.000]  So he's he's the plug for it.
[18:05.000 --> 18:06.000]  Nice.
[18:07.000 --> 18:08.000]  Get a clone from him.
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.000]  I'll find it for you.
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  So so where did you pick up a lot of these Dave?
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  Were they auctions?
[18:19.000 --> 18:20.000]  Seed banks?
[18:21.000 --> 18:22.000]  Where where did you find a lot of the Dominion gear?
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  Because you've I'm assuming this is more than just kind of one one come up.
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  A lot of them came through auctions all over the place.
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  This one was actually on an auction on Duke's discord, which people here we
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  should at some some point maybe try and post a link or something because that's
[18:41.000 --> 18:42.000]  a killer discord.
[18:43.000 --> 18:44.000]  Probably one of my favorites.
[18:45.000 --> 18:46.000]  Just a great hangout spot.
[18:47.000 --> 18:48.000]  Great place to shoot the shit.
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.000]  Talk about Dominion seeds and get the chance to talk to Duke because he's
[18:53.000 --> 18:54.000]  he does some giveaways on Friday nights.
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.000]  It's good.
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  Nice awesome hot sauce and seeds every Friday night.
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.000]  Sauce and seeds.
[19:02.000 --> 19:03.000]  Fuck yeah.
[19:04.000 --> 19:05.000]  That's a t shirt.
[19:06.000 --> 19:07.000]  Yeah.
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  No, I will find that and I will post that here while in the course of our
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.000]  talking.
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.000]  I guess, you know, we were on the actually I'm stoned and I was so excited by
[19:17.000 --> 19:18.000]  playing that video earlier.
[19:19.000 --> 19:23.000]  I forgot to do the shout out that I was going to do because usually on
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  Wednesdays right here on Teacher Cannabis Project, it's the butterfly sessions.
[19:27.000 --> 19:32.000]  PJ West and London helping but PJ West interviews a lot of the females within
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.000]  the industry who are making moves making things happen.
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  Very smart individuals and they need to be highlighted.
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  So she's on here every Wednesday at seven o'clock Pacific Standard Time doing
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.000]  that.
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.000]  But they graciously said, OK, once a month we'll let you do your seed thing.
[19:52.000 --> 19:53.000]  Come on.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  Now they're going to be doing that.
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.000]  Come on.
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  Now they graciously did that.
[19:59.000 --> 20:04.000]  So I wanted to just mention that in case you showed up expecting that and you're
[20:04.000 --> 20:05.000]  getting this.
[20:06.000 --> 20:07.000]  Thank you.
[20:07.000 --> 20:11.000]  Thank you, ladies, for making the time so we could get in there and do this
[20:12.000 --> 20:16.000]  thing. But yeah, like they definitely need their shout outs and, you know, their
[20:17.000 --> 20:21.000]  highlights and everything, too, because like there's so many of them out there.
[20:21.000 --> 20:26.000]  Yeah. So bad ass at what they do and they just get overlooked all the time and
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  shit man. All like the best growers I ever knew.
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.000]  They were all they were all ladies, you know, and a lot of the hard work.
[20:34.000 --> 20:35.000]  I'm sorry.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  I said that ain't no shit neither.
[20:37.000 --> 20:38.000]  I can.
[20:39.000 --> 20:40.000]  Yeah.
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  It's kind of fucked up how the whole game is real.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  But, you know, a lot of the harder.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  Yeah. A lot of you know, a lot of the hard workers, too.
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  You often don't see from them because they're so fucking busy just grinding like
[20:52.000 --> 20:53.000]  that. That's what they do.
[20:53.000 --> 20:58.000]  So, you know, it is cool to pull some of these people from out out in the light.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  Awesome. Thanks, Dave, for the discord link.
[21:03.000 --> 21:07.000]  I'll drop this in the chat for everybody and then I'll get it in the show
[21:07.000 --> 21:08.000]  description, too.
[21:09.000 --> 21:14.000]  But I also I also since since I started off last last show with the shirt that
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  that was kind of my collector item for the week.
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  I got kind of another collector item here and it's another shirt.
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.000]  So I'm going to start out with this instead of seeds this month.
[21:22.000 --> 21:25.000]  But this came in from Kazoo Kazoo.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  And it's it's one of my friends, Eagle Gardens.
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.000]  He does a show.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  He's got his YouTube channel, Eagle Gardens.
[21:32.000 --> 21:38.000]  But this is a new weed nerd world logo that he had designed and he threw it on
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  a tie dye.
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  And I'm like, dude, I fucking want that shirt.
[21:43.000 --> 21:48.000]  And Kazoo being not only where is it where my wife hadn't stole it yet.
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  I told her I have to have it for a picture.
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  Not only did he send me a T-shirt.
[21:53.000 --> 21:54.000]  Let me go full screen again for this.
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.000]  You guys are just going to be mind blown.
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.000]  Fucking fanny pack.
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  And it's one of those reversible ones, bro.
[22:02.000 --> 22:05.000]  I could do this all day to it.
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  Kazoo knows how to hook a brother up, doesn't he?
[22:10.000 --> 22:11.000]  Yeah. Yeah.
[22:11.000 --> 22:12.000]  Yeah.
[22:12.000 --> 22:18.000]  Fanny packs really come come in handy to men like it can be clutch.
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  Amazingly, I'm going to an Elton John show Sunday and it might actually work.
[22:24.000 --> 22:29.000]  But now my wife practically fucking I'm opening the I'm opening a package.
[22:29.000 --> 22:33.000]  The carrier pigeon brought and I almost got elbowed out of the way when she saw
[22:33.000 --> 22:34.000]  the sequence.
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  So it's spoken for.
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.000]  But I got it.
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  I get to keep the T-shirt and I got something else to show.
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  A little bit later, but I wanted to bring that one in today.
[22:45.000 --> 22:46.000]  That's awesome.
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  Tiny dancer in your fanny pack, man.
[22:50.000 --> 22:51.000]  Not touching that.
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.000]  I think that's for life.
[22:55.000 --> 22:56.000]  Did a great job.
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.000]  He did. I love the design.
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.000]  It's, you know, it's strong.
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  It's bold.
[23:02.000 --> 23:03.000]  It's going to stick out.
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  So I really dig it.
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  And, you know, to quote the man himself, fanny packs for life.
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.000]  Thank you, Kazoo.
[23:10.000 --> 23:11.000]  Much love, brother.
[23:12.000 --> 23:13.000]  Very stoked for that.
[23:14.000 --> 23:15.000]  Yeah.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  So, all right.
[23:18.000 --> 23:19.000]  Let's let's see.
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  I saw that, you know, the big, big bag earlier there.
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  What do you got to what do you want to show us?
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  What's what's something in there that you're like, this was I.
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  This is cool.
[23:31.000 --> 23:32.000]  Well, this would is reach in, man.
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  Yeah.
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.000]  What is up in here?
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  Oh, paper bag.
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  That's what everybody on the news is imagining.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  Cannabis people do to kids when they come to their door.
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  They just open up the big bag of seeds.
[23:46.000 --> 23:47.000]  Here's your candy kids.
[23:48.000 --> 23:49.000]  Right.
[23:49.000 --> 23:50.000]  Yeah, man.
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.000]  Well, I know it's a fucking chumo fucking neighbor and shit trying to roof
[23:54.000 --> 23:55.000]  you may need to be worrying about.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  I'm worried about some potheads and shit.
[23:59.000 --> 24:03.000]  I love how they warn you, warn you like, oh, warning parents about the
[24:03.000 --> 24:04.000]  children receiving edibles.
[24:04.000 --> 24:05.000]  For Halloween candy.
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  It's like, who's going to give away their amazing edibles?
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  Like, nobody likes your kid that much.
[24:09.000 --> 24:10.000]  Come on.
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.000]  Yeah, they're not.
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  They're not that cool, man.
[24:13.000 --> 24:14.000]  No.
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  No.
[24:15.000 --> 24:16.000]  All right.
[24:17.000 --> 24:18.000]  So this.
[24:19.000 --> 24:22.000]  So I'm going to revisit some old stuff.
[24:23.000 --> 24:24.000]  So it's kind of like cool.
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  Like you were you had the weed nerd from Eagle and you were like,
[24:28.000 --> 24:29.000]  I'm going to give away my candy.
[24:29.000 --> 24:30.000]  Yeah.
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.000]  But my buddy Tardis, man, he had the hook on some old sub cool gear.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  So I got.
[24:37.000 --> 24:38.000]  Yeah.
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  So did Badger used to used to make all the seeds and everything, you know,
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  and keep everything pollinated and stocked up.
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.000]  So they had like a like an overflow, I guess, you know,
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.000]  that they had been hanging on to.
[24:50.000 --> 24:51.000]  And so I got a.
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.000]  And I got a.
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.000]  And I got a.
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  Like an overflow, I guess, you know, that they had been hanging on to.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  So he sent me some fucking Chernobyl's.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  Oh, that's that's the ticket right there, man.
[25:06.000 --> 25:07.000]  Wow.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  Pretty. That can be pretty cool.
[25:09.000 --> 25:10.000]  Yeah.
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  Oh.
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.000]  He also sent me this is what I'm stuck on, Jack, the ripper, buddy.
[25:19.000 --> 25:20.000]  Boom.
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.000]  Yeah.
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.000]  Jack the ripper.
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.880]  Now, have you ever run the Jack's Cleaner 2 from TGA?
[25:26.880 --> 25:31.880]  So I'd run the Jack's Cleaner P1 clone for a long time.
[25:32.020 --> 25:34.080]  And then I ran the Jack the Ripper,
[25:34.080 --> 25:36.400]  and then I ran the JC2 as well.
[25:36.400 --> 25:38.320]  And I liked all of them.
[25:38.320 --> 25:40.320]  The original mom is like,
[25:41.240 --> 25:43.560]  God, you're such a bitch, man.
[25:43.560 --> 25:45.960]  Like, I'd only like torture myself
[25:45.960 --> 25:47.840]  like once a year growing it.
[25:47.840 --> 25:48.680]  And it's like,
[25:48.680 --> 25:51.280]  well, there's plants it's like good to humble yourself with,
[25:51.800 --> 25:54.440]  because it's just such a motherfucker, man.
[25:54.440 --> 25:57.600]  But super good weed, super good weed.
[25:57.600 --> 26:01.200]  The Jack the Ripper, like, way easier.
[26:01.200 --> 26:02.940]  And then the JC2,
[26:02.940 --> 26:05.760]  like you were getting some like improved cleaner plants
[26:05.760 --> 26:08.360]  that weren't like herming all over the place.
[26:08.360 --> 26:13.360]  So yeah, I'd highly recommend that JC2 if you got some.
[26:13.760 --> 26:14.600]  Nice.
[26:14.600 --> 26:16.180]  Yeah, that's one that I ran.
[26:17.120 --> 26:19.840]  And I still actually have a little bit of that flower left.
[26:19.840 --> 26:21.920]  It's been almost a year,
[26:21.920 --> 26:23.720]  but I ran it for a long time,
[26:23.720 --> 26:26.840]  made some crosses for myself with it.
[26:26.840 --> 26:31.280]  But I still have, I think maybe five of the seeds,
[26:31.280 --> 26:36.120]  the original seeds there from back when it was still TGA too.
[26:36.120 --> 26:40.560]  Because in 2012, the medical market here in Washington,
[26:41.400 --> 26:45.800]  it was actually Jinx Proof who got TGA stuff
[26:45.800 --> 26:47.280]  into the stores here.
[26:47.320 --> 26:50.040]  And the Jack's Cleaner 2 was my first,
[26:50.040 --> 26:53.320]  I always say it's my first pro clone that I ever got.
[26:53.320 --> 26:56.060]  My first strain, I picked it up from a dispensary,
[26:56.060 --> 26:58.800]  loved it, and then saw the seeds a little bit later.
[26:58.800 --> 27:00.180]  And I'm like, yank.
[27:01.400 --> 27:02.600]  Hell yeah, dude.
[27:02.600 --> 27:04.000]  Yeah, that one, it was good, man.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.120]  It yielded good, real frosty,
[27:06.120 --> 27:10.320]  had the good lime fucking floor cleaner thing kicking.
[27:10.320 --> 27:12.360]  Just as good, real good weed.
[27:12.360 --> 27:14.640]  That was one, and actually this is all
[27:14.640 --> 27:16.800]  that's left in this jar.
[27:17.400 --> 27:20.200]  I need to refill my JC2 jar.
[27:21.080 --> 27:23.080]  Oh shit, you're still growing, that's awesome.
[27:23.080 --> 27:25.800]  But this one, that was one that would eat
[27:25.800 --> 27:28.280]  the rubber seal in your jar.
[27:28.280 --> 27:31.120]  Like it was so astringent, just the lemon.
[27:31.120 --> 27:33.200]  Yeah, lemonade and all that.
[27:33.200 --> 27:34.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[27:34.040 --> 27:34.880]  Yeah.
[27:34.880 --> 27:35.720]  Yeah.
[27:35.720 --> 27:38.200]  It ain't no shit neither, man.
[27:38.200 --> 27:43.200]  Like it's really, really, really good.
[27:43.400 --> 27:45.680]  That's something that I like
[27:45.680 --> 27:49.760]  for the morning time, like just the lemon.
[27:49.760 --> 27:51.320]  You know, anything usually like really high
[27:51.320 --> 27:54.720]  in limonene is I'm looking at in the morning.
[27:54.720 --> 27:59.520]  Yeah, I used to do train wreck in the morning times, man.
[27:59.520 --> 28:03.200]  That was always a good one for me
[28:03.200 --> 28:04.920]  to get the brain kind of started.
[28:04.920 --> 28:08.520]  It went with the coffee really good too.
[28:09.680 --> 28:10.520]  Yeah.
[28:10.520 --> 28:11.640]  It was always big on that.
[28:12.680 --> 28:13.520]  Yeah.
[28:13.920 --> 28:16.680]  The TGA stuff was really my introduction
[28:16.680 --> 28:19.680]  to the kind of the fruity or the more flavorful side.
[28:19.680 --> 28:24.280]  And like I said, it was, you know, 2011, 2012
[28:24.280 --> 28:28.120]  when those were like flower in the med dispensaries here.
[28:28.120 --> 28:30.160]  And then, you know, people started getting the cuts
[28:30.160 --> 28:33.480]  and the seeds, but that's when everybody was still,
[28:33.480 --> 28:36.320]  you know, OG, Kush, Diesel.
[28:37.520 --> 28:38.360]  I'm always.
[28:38.360 --> 28:39.200]  Yeah, that's the thing, man.
[28:39.200 --> 28:41.040]  You get burned out, you'll get burned out,
[28:41.320 --> 28:44.400]  smoking the same shit around the clock day in and day out.
[28:44.400 --> 28:47.640]  You know, it's good to switch up the gene pool
[28:47.640 --> 28:49.360]  and the profiles, man.
[28:49.360 --> 28:52.080]  And, you know, you'll get all burned out on one
[28:52.080 --> 28:54.320]  and go, like I said, smoke something like that
[28:54.320 --> 28:55.720]  and just rock your world.
[28:55.720 --> 28:58.800]  So it's good to freshen it up for sure.
[28:59.840 --> 29:02.360]  Yeah, that and the Agent Orange were the two
[29:02.360 --> 29:06.320]  that I picked up and grew from TGA.
[29:06.320 --> 29:09.400]  Yeah, that Agent Orange was really good.
[29:09.400 --> 29:13.840]  I got to smoke his first like batch of like running it
[29:13.840 --> 29:15.680]  and shit back in the day.
[29:15.680 --> 29:19.320]  I was out in Oregon helping a buddy set his like house up
[29:19.320 --> 29:23.560]  and shit, went by Sub's place and he gave me like a fat sack
[29:23.560 --> 29:26.520]  of that and some Jack the Ripper and some 3D
[29:26.520 --> 29:28.040]  and all types of shit.
[29:28.040 --> 29:33.040]  And I remember I woke up and was staying on my bro's
[29:33.360 --> 29:36.040]  fucking couch in a fucking get up.
[29:36.040 --> 29:38.120]  And I'm like, yes, I smoked a bowl
[29:38.160 --> 29:39.520]  of that fucking Agent Orange.
[29:39.520 --> 29:41.800]  And like, it was all nice, like, you know,
[29:41.800 --> 29:45.600]  fall time in Oregon, you know, it's all like feeling good.
[29:45.600 --> 29:48.520]  And the sun was like just shining, like just right, man.
[29:48.520 --> 29:50.280]  I was like fucking A dude.
[29:50.280 --> 29:53.640]  And I ended up walking like four miles down the road,
[29:53.640 --> 29:56.320]  fucking and got a chicken biscuit out of Carl's Jr.
[29:56.320 --> 29:57.520]  and walked my ass back.
[29:58.680 --> 29:59.960]  Yeah, it was good, man.
[29:59.960 --> 30:01.640]  A whole packet of honey and shit.
[30:01.640 --> 30:03.400]  Yeah, it was all right, man.
[30:03.400 --> 30:07.120]  Dude, I'm really all about the biscuits, but yeah.
[30:08.080 --> 30:10.040]  A fall day in Oregon could do that to you,
[30:10.040 --> 30:11.760]  especially if you're in Portland, man.
[30:11.760 --> 30:13.360]  It's just keep it weird.
[30:13.360 --> 30:14.200]  That's the theme.
[30:14.200 --> 30:16.680]  That's the theme of Portland is keep it weird.
[30:16.680 --> 30:17.520]  Yeah, man.
[30:17.520 --> 30:22.240]  Yeah, I was off of, was it 82nd and Duke Street?
[30:22.240 --> 30:23.320]  Oh, wow.
[30:23.320 --> 30:24.160]  Yeah, never.
[30:24.160 --> 30:26.840]  Southeast or whatever.
[30:26.840 --> 30:31.000]  Yeah, Southeast Portland is usually where the fun happens.
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.360]  Like I used to live on Southeast Foster Place.
[30:33.360 --> 30:34.760]  I worked at a big five over there.
[30:34.760 --> 30:37.040]  It's right in between all the strip joints.
[30:37.760 --> 30:38.600]  Great place.
[30:38.600 --> 30:39.920]  Oh yeah, fuck yeah, man.
[30:39.920 --> 30:42.080]  That's Southeast Portland for you though.
[30:42.080 --> 30:42.920]  Oh yeah, man.
[30:42.920 --> 30:45.680]  There's always something going on around there.
[30:45.680 --> 30:46.520]  Yeah.
[30:46.520 --> 30:47.360]  Always.
[30:47.360 --> 30:50.920]  And speaking of fun questions,
[30:50.920 --> 30:53.920]  I don't know if you could confirm or deny this, Duke,
[30:53.920 --> 30:58.400]  but rubber ducky isopods, is Duke Diamond stole my bike?
[30:58.400 --> 30:59.240]  My bike.
[31:00.960 --> 31:01.800]  It's my bike.
[31:03.440 --> 31:04.760]  Oh, we love you, Brian.
[31:04.760 --> 31:06.000]  Thanks for hanging out tonight.
[31:06.960 --> 31:09.240]  You know, rubber ducky isopods,
[31:09.240 --> 31:11.440]  Brian and Marco show on Wednesdays
[31:11.440 --> 31:14.360]  and then Brian and Layton on Thursdays.
[31:14.360 --> 31:16.120]  So stoked to see him hanging out here.
[31:16.120 --> 31:17.720]  It's gotta be late, man.
[31:17.720 --> 31:20.040]  Kids must be keeping them up tonight.
[31:20.040 --> 31:21.320]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[31:21.320 --> 31:25.880]  He's probably still working, probably cleaning.
[31:25.880 --> 31:26.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:26.720 --> 31:29.280]  No, I admire dude's hustle.
[31:29.280 --> 31:31.120]  So thanks for the question
[31:31.120 --> 31:34.720]  and I don't think you're getting your bike back though.
[31:34.720 --> 31:35.760]  Maybe, maybe.
[31:36.520 --> 31:38.680]  You'll get it back better than you lost it.
[31:39.920 --> 31:40.760]  That's it.
[31:40.760 --> 31:43.360]  Come on, Debo doesn't give back the bike.
[31:43.360 --> 31:44.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:44.440 --> 31:45.840]  I'm better than Debo, man.
[31:45.840 --> 31:47.000]  Better Debo.
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.360]  Now you ain't got a wonky eye or nothing, man.
[31:51.120 --> 31:51.960]  No.
[31:51.960 --> 31:52.800]  Way better.
[31:52.800 --> 31:53.640]  Way better.
[31:53.640 --> 31:55.080]  Oh, that's funny.
[31:55.080 --> 31:56.560]  Me and my wife, we watched Friday
[31:56.560 --> 31:59.040]  and then Friday too again recently.
[31:59.040 --> 32:00.800]  Just like, why not?
[32:01.800 --> 32:03.800]  I could just put it on anytime.
[32:03.840 --> 32:04.680]  Oh yeah.
[32:04.680 --> 32:06.600]  Did we post Duke's Discord to T-Arc?
[32:06.600 --> 32:07.840]  No, we didn't.
[32:09.920 --> 32:10.760]  Whoops.
[32:10.760 --> 32:13.840]  Through the magic of television, we just did.
[32:13.840 --> 32:16.240]  So there's the Discord and keep reminding me guys
[32:16.240 --> 32:18.200]  cause I'll keep posting that throughout the night.
[32:18.200 --> 32:20.000]  You definitely want to hop on there.
[32:20.880 --> 32:23.080]  Dave, thanks for bringing that up.
[32:23.080 --> 32:24.280]  See, Peter's in here.
[32:24.280 --> 32:25.320]  He's got a big worm.
[32:25.320 --> 32:26.720]  What's up, big worm?
[32:27.760 --> 32:29.880]  I could play big worm if I got this,
[32:29.880 --> 32:31.280]  you know, if I got a little bit of a perm.
[32:31.640 --> 32:34.040]  Duke, you're working on some hair yourself, brother.
[32:34.040 --> 32:34.880]  Yeah, man.
[32:34.880 --> 32:36.640]  Just fucking getting it grown back out,
[32:36.640 --> 32:39.200]  but I don't give it a whole lot of love.
[32:39.200 --> 32:43.440]  Like, you know, you have very exceptional hair, Chad.
[32:43.440 --> 32:45.160]  Like, you really do.
[32:45.160 --> 32:46.640]  It's like, wow, man.
[32:49.400 --> 32:53.440]  Yeah, I need to get some tips from you and shit, man.
[32:53.440 --> 32:55.360]  That's my only fans.
[32:55.360 --> 32:57.040]  You're going to have your pollination.
[32:57.040 --> 32:58.360]  Mine is just fucking-
[32:58.360 --> 32:59.920]  Be like combing your hair?
[32:59.920 --> 33:01.400]  Yeah.
[33:01.400 --> 33:02.720]  400 strokes.
[33:02.720 --> 33:03.560]  ASMR.
[33:06.480 --> 33:09.080]  I sent Dave, and I know this is so off subject
[33:09.080 --> 33:10.400]  for anybody watching.
[33:10.400 --> 33:11.240]  I'm sorry.
[33:11.240 --> 33:13.480]  We're going to get back to seeds in a second.
[33:13.480 --> 33:16.120]  But you know how YouTube gives you these suggested things?
[33:16.120 --> 33:18.280]  And I sent this to Dave so he can verify.
[33:18.280 --> 33:23.280]  But one of the suggested videos was seed sorting ASMR.
[33:25.000 --> 33:26.440]  Yes.
[33:26.440 --> 33:28.720]  And it was all about a girl just counting seeds
[33:28.720 --> 33:29.960]  and putting them in this little...
[33:29.960 --> 33:32.360]  I fucking watched it for like 20 minutes.
[33:32.360 --> 33:33.200]  But-
[33:33.200 --> 33:34.040]  See, they got you, dude.
[33:34.040 --> 33:34.880]  So I was about to...
[33:40.350 --> 33:43.750]  We're going to dedicate the next portion of this show
[33:43.750 --> 33:46.350]  to ASMR Duke.
[33:46.350 --> 33:47.190]  Please.
[33:48.190 --> 33:50.030]  All right, Duke.
[33:50.030 --> 33:51.830]  Now, I'm not going to whisper to you guys.
[33:51.830 --> 33:53.230]  That's just a little creepy, man.
[33:53.230 --> 33:54.070]  I don't need to whisper.
[33:54.070 --> 33:54.910]  Yeah, yeah.
[33:56.550 --> 33:57.830]  So, I got both those seeds.
[33:57.830 --> 34:00.230]  Dave, what have you picked up in the mail lately?
[34:01.670 --> 34:02.830]  Good segue.
[34:04.230 --> 34:05.070]  Let's see.
[34:05.070 --> 34:09.070]  Sadly, nothing of Duke's lately, but I recently got...
[34:12.070 --> 34:13.310]  We're going to have to ask him
[34:13.310 --> 34:15.750]  if he's got new stuff coming out later.
[34:15.750 --> 34:17.190]  Oh yeah.
[34:17.190 --> 34:18.470]  Yeah, April.
[34:18.470 --> 34:19.310]  Ooh, nice.
[34:19.310 --> 34:21.270]  That's a mean gene.
[34:21.270 --> 34:23.750]  Root beer freeze.
[34:23.750 --> 34:26.630]  Root beer times root beer times root beer times Jaro
[34:26.630 --> 34:29.390]  times root beer times root beer times root beer times Jaro.
[34:29.390 --> 34:30.790]  That's a tongue twister.
[34:30.790 --> 34:32.790]  That's a lot of root beer.
[34:32.790 --> 34:34.110]  That is.
[34:34.110 --> 34:35.590]  That is a hot one.
[34:36.350 --> 34:39.350]  Now, that was one of the recent drops I saw.
[34:39.350 --> 34:43.310]  I remember actually seeing something on Instagram for that.
[34:43.310 --> 34:44.150]  Oh yeah.
[34:44.150 --> 34:45.630]  Yeah, it was just recently.
[34:45.630 --> 34:50.070]  I don't know if Dag is going to get them, but they might.
[34:50.070 --> 34:50.910]  I don't know.
[34:50.910 --> 34:52.270]  I can't confirm or deny that.
[34:52.270 --> 34:53.990]  I have no knowledge of that,
[34:53.990 --> 34:58.150]  but I do know that it could be potentially really good.
[34:58.150 --> 34:59.270]  So, we'll see.
[34:59.270 --> 35:00.110]  Nice.
[35:00.110 --> 35:01.150]  And I know in the past,
[35:01.150 --> 35:05.070]  Dag has definitely carried the freeborn selection,
[35:05.070 --> 35:06.510]  Mean Genes gear.
[35:08.430 --> 35:12.150]  It was not in that video that was awesomely crafted,
[35:12.150 --> 35:16.190]  but Peter will know if we're going to have some back soon.
[35:16.190 --> 35:18.710]  So, that looks like a good one.
[35:18.710 --> 35:19.550]  It's a good one.
[35:19.550 --> 35:22.110]  You guys, they did have this on the Dagger website
[35:22.110 --> 35:25.190]  for a brief minute before it sold out pretty damn quick.
[35:25.190 --> 35:26.030]  What do we got?
[35:26.030 --> 35:27.910]  Lime sour, sour diesel skunk.
[35:27.910 --> 35:29.790]  Oh yes.
[35:29.790 --> 35:31.430]  That's a new one.
[35:31.430 --> 35:33.470]  Skunk Tech's been putting out some new stuff
[35:33.470 --> 35:35.510]  and they've been collaborating a lot.
[35:35.510 --> 35:37.350]  Do you know anything more about that?
[35:39.430 --> 35:42.310]  I do actually have a cut going right now,
[35:42.310 --> 35:43.870]  skunk tech sour diesel.
[35:44.830 --> 35:46.950]  We'll see what the lime does to it,
[35:46.950 --> 35:51.310]  but I'll let you know how that skunk tech sour diesel is
[35:51.310 --> 35:52.630]  in a few weeks.
[35:53.990 --> 35:56.190]  Let's see, I'll flip her in maybe two weeks.
[35:57.350 --> 36:00.190]  And then I'll let you know.
[36:00.190 --> 36:01.510]  When the wait begin.
[36:01.510 --> 36:02.350]  Yeah.
[36:03.190 --> 36:05.350]  When I'm around Valentine.
[36:05.350 --> 36:07.390]  She's a finicky.
[36:07.390 --> 36:08.710]  She's a finicky bitch though.
[36:08.710 --> 36:10.390]  I'll say that much about her.
[36:10.390 --> 36:12.390]  She's an older sour cut.
[36:12.390 --> 36:15.750]  So, you got to treat her perfect.
[36:17.270 --> 36:20.430]  Nutrition, does it like low light levels?
[36:20.430 --> 36:22.350]  Yes, yes.
[36:22.350 --> 36:24.750]  Definitely not very intense light for her.
[36:26.750 --> 36:28.150]  And that's something that you could sometimes
[36:28.150 --> 36:30.750]  get away with in veg and then discover in flour.
[36:30.750 --> 36:32.190]  You're just blasting her hard
[36:33.030 --> 36:34.750]  and that's usually when you see a nanner pop out.
[36:35.990 --> 36:38.590]  That and they want to fluff out on you too.
[36:39.990 --> 36:43.070]  That canopy temp gets a little bit too warm.
[36:43.070 --> 36:45.790]  It'll fluff out on you like a motherfucker.
[36:45.790 --> 36:49.150]  And if you're not front loading on your calcium
[36:49.150 --> 36:50.950]  and everything ahead of time,
[36:52.390 --> 36:54.550]  you run into that hiccup mid-flour.
[36:54.550 --> 36:56.110]  That'll fuck you up.
[36:56.110 --> 36:59.550]  You got to keep mindful on your root zone temperatures
[36:59.550 --> 37:00.390]  with it too.
[37:00.510 --> 37:02.670]  And this is like you want a perfect, perfect,
[37:02.670 --> 37:03.910]  perfect run of sour.
[37:05.790 --> 37:08.830]  Yeah, there's a lot of little tricks with it
[37:08.830 --> 37:12.630]  if you want to get it off and be able to take it 11,
[37:12.630 --> 37:13.990]  maybe 12 weeks.
[37:14.830 --> 37:16.710]  Take it to the next level.
[37:16.710 --> 37:19.390]  Yeah, but you're in it for the long haul.
[37:19.390 --> 37:22.910]  So, you really got to think your shit through.
[37:24.230 --> 37:27.270]  The time where people are stopping feeding,
[37:27.310 --> 37:29.430]  you're still having some considerations
[37:29.430 --> 37:32.310]  on keeping it happy.
[37:32.310 --> 37:36.430]  So, yeah, it's quite the process.
[37:37.350 --> 37:41.390]  Wow, and I've never grown sour myself.
[37:41.390 --> 37:45.470]  I've had some in the lineage,
[37:45.470 --> 37:49.590]  but I've never grown just a real sour diesel myself.
[37:49.590 --> 37:52.350]  I have heard that though about some of these
[37:52.350 --> 37:53.790]  kind of like classic strains
[37:54.230 --> 37:57.750]  and Gorilla Glue 4 isn't a classic strain,
[37:57.750 --> 38:00.110]  but it's a very popular strain as well.
[38:00.110 --> 38:01.510]  I've heard some of these things
[38:01.510 --> 38:03.590]  can just be really finicky, man.
[38:03.590 --> 38:05.830]  Is that why like monocropping just helps?
[38:05.830 --> 38:09.110]  Because if you're trying to do too much with these plants,
[38:09.110 --> 38:12.350]  it's just a beast.
[38:12.350 --> 38:13.630]  It can run you ragged.
[38:15.790 --> 38:18.190]  Are there any other popular ones that everybody's like,
[38:18.190 --> 38:19.710]  oh yeah, this is the best,
[38:19.710 --> 38:23.550]  that in reality we're actually kind of a bitch to grow
[38:24.310 --> 38:25.870]  or make you almost not wanna grow it?
[38:25.870 --> 38:27.510]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[38:27.510 --> 38:30.550]  Fucking, so that's the thing is like we bring up sour
[38:30.550 --> 38:34.030]  and my buddy fucking Amish is like just shitting text.
[38:34.030 --> 38:35.990]  Like I'm just watching them one after the other
[38:35.990 --> 38:37.350]  coming through about sour.
[38:37.350 --> 38:41.070]  Like just stop Amish, stop.
[38:42.190 --> 38:44.350]  Calm down, drink a fucking beer, dude.
[38:44.350 --> 38:45.950]  You'll be all right, it's cool.
[38:46.830 --> 38:47.670]  I know, I know.
[38:48.590 --> 38:49.550]  It's all good, bro.
[38:51.110 --> 38:52.670]  As well, as well.
[38:54.550 --> 38:55.390]  I don't know.
[38:55.390 --> 38:59.990]  So let me see here.
[39:02.230 --> 39:04.150]  Being amused by chat names real quick
[39:04.150 --> 39:05.630]  now that my attention has gone to chat.
[39:05.630 --> 39:08.470]  I'm just gonna post the discord in there again though.
[39:08.470 --> 39:11.470]  So everybody want to hang out,
[39:11.470 --> 39:13.670]  the Duke's discord, definitely go and do that.
[39:13.670 --> 39:15.790]  Cause you said a lot of good conversations, Dave,
[39:15.790 --> 39:17.670]  a lot of like minds.
[39:17.670 --> 39:19.150]  It's a great place to hang out.
[39:19.150 --> 39:21.070]  It definitely is.
[39:21.070 --> 39:22.710]  If you're into this show,
[39:22.710 --> 39:24.110]  if you're into watching this show,
[39:24.110 --> 39:27.390]  you will be a fan of that discord, hands down.
[39:27.390 --> 39:29.270]  It's a great place.
[39:29.270 --> 39:30.550]  Cause I don't know how to gauge it.
[39:30.550 --> 39:32.870]  It's like so many Virginia people in there.
[39:32.870 --> 39:35.230]  And like, you know, like some people are like,
[39:35.230 --> 39:36.470]  oh, it's so rowdy.
[39:37.270 --> 39:40.110]  You know, I was like, oh no, it seems normal to me,
[39:40.110 --> 39:42.550]  but I guess it's a little fucked up,
[39:42.550 --> 39:44.950]  but I kind of like it that way.
[39:44.950 --> 39:47.110]  It definitely helps the closer you live
[39:47.110 --> 39:48.390]  to the Chesapeake Bay.
[39:48.390 --> 39:50.230]  Like the closer you are to there,
[39:50.430 --> 39:52.750]  the more in you'll feel,
[39:52.750 --> 39:55.110]  but it's still a great place no matter where you're from.
[39:55.110 --> 39:56.390]  Sweet. Awesome.
[39:56.390 --> 39:57.230]  Good to know.
[39:57.230 --> 39:58.390]  Good to know.
[39:58.390 --> 39:59.470]  I don't know how to gauge it.
[39:59.470 --> 40:01.390]  Sometimes I'm scared to even invite people.
[40:01.390 --> 40:02.830]  I'm just like, I don't know.
[40:04.190 --> 40:05.030]  Yeah.
[40:05.030 --> 40:07.870]  Enter at your own risk.
[40:11.190 --> 40:12.510]  What is that old shit?
[40:12.510 --> 40:15.750]  All who enter ye abandon all hope or something.
[40:15.750 --> 40:16.590]  All right.
[40:16.710 --> 40:17.550]  All right.
[40:17.550 --> 40:20.350]  Oh, I see a couple of people just joined.
[40:20.350 --> 40:21.550]  Rob Champ just joined.
[40:21.550 --> 40:23.390]  Memes are going off.
[40:24.430 --> 40:25.910]  You like the memes over there?
[40:27.070 --> 40:30.790]  Oh yeah, the meme channel's off the chain over there, dude.
[40:30.790 --> 40:33.870]  It's so fucked up, man, but yeah, yeah.
[40:33.870 --> 40:34.830]  Enjoy that.
[40:35.790 --> 40:36.950]  I'll have to check it out.
[40:36.950 --> 40:37.950]  So, all right.
[40:37.950 --> 40:40.950]  Let's dig back into the pile
[40:40.950 --> 40:43.310]  or the bag of tricks you got there, Duke.
[40:43.630 --> 40:47.670]  What can we pull out next year to talk about?
[40:47.670 --> 40:50.350]  I got, I'm just reaching at random.
[40:50.350 --> 40:53.470]  So, I pulled out the Granny Skunk.
[40:53.470 --> 40:57.470]  So, definitely gonna be dipping back
[40:57.470 --> 41:00.190]  into a good amount of these.
[41:00.190 --> 41:03.350]  So, really good one, man.
[41:03.350 --> 41:05.430]  Virginia Beach, Afghani,
[41:05.430 --> 41:08.910]  across to the Skelly Hash Plant Skunk Hybrid.
[41:08.910 --> 41:10.870]  Really, really nice shit, man.
[41:11.870 --> 41:13.390]  What drew you to her?
[41:13.390 --> 41:16.590]  What made you say this one's a winner?
[41:18.470 --> 41:22.310]  So, winner to me, I like, you know,
[41:22.310 --> 41:25.630]  potency has gotta be there
[41:25.630 --> 41:29.390]  and like long lasting, strong,
[41:29.390 --> 41:31.070]  whether it's like got you crawling
[41:31.070 --> 41:34.150]  all over the fucking ceiling, you know, zipping around
[41:34.150 --> 41:36.270]  or got you laid out on the floor.
[41:36.270 --> 41:38.870]  Like I like good, strong, potent weed
[41:38.910 --> 41:41.190]  and I like good stinky weed too.
[41:42.350 --> 41:43.990]  Beyond that, like, you know,
[41:43.990 --> 41:46.030]  some things yield a little more than others
[41:46.030 --> 41:48.310]  and that's just how it is.
[41:48.310 --> 41:52.470]  But yeah, that and in her, like,
[41:53.470 --> 41:57.350]  was getting like these really, really big fat pinecone buds
[41:57.350 --> 42:01.270]  and getting that really, really strong pine incense
[42:01.270 --> 42:02.910]  type of funk out of it.
[42:02.910 --> 42:06.310]  Both like, it's like that nag champ,
[42:06.310 --> 42:08.470]  opium type of deal going on.
[42:09.070 --> 42:10.870]  Like those are like my favorite ones
[42:11.790 --> 42:15.670]  and it like make you like feel like really uncomfortable
[42:15.670 --> 42:17.510]  at first, you know, but then it just melts
[42:17.510 --> 42:21.190]  into like paralysis and I like weed like that, you know.
[42:22.030 --> 42:23.710]  But that, you know, that kind of sounds like,
[42:23.710 --> 42:27.390]  it reminds me of some descriptions I get of like pith,
[42:27.390 --> 42:30.070]  which is almost kind of an elusive thing
[42:30.070 --> 42:31.430]  on the West Coast at least,
[42:31.430 --> 42:34.150]  but that kind of the incense, nag champa,
[42:34.150 --> 42:37.630]  strong, strong effects.
[42:37.990 --> 42:41.470]  Is there maybe anything related somewhere in the heritage
[42:41.470 --> 42:45.190]  or has anybody really decided what pith actually is?
[42:45.190 --> 42:47.110]  I guess we'll start with that.
[42:47.110 --> 42:49.710]  Yeah, I think it's, I think a lot of that shit
[42:49.710 --> 42:53.110]  was NL5 haze, you know, so.
[42:53.110 --> 42:54.950]  Yeah, yeah.
[42:54.950 --> 42:58.150]  Yeah, yeah, I think like sometimes, you know,
[42:58.150 --> 43:02.830]  we'll get like common like terpene profiles
[43:02.830 --> 43:05.750]  and things that are like not even like related
[43:05.750 --> 43:07.150]  like whatsoever, you know.
[43:07.670 --> 43:09.270]  They're so far removed from each other,
[43:09.270 --> 43:11.830]  but yet you can still get that,
[43:11.830 --> 43:14.590]  kind of that same smell from it, you know what I mean?
[43:16.030 --> 43:19.670]  The way they work in combination sometimes is amazing too.
[43:19.670 --> 43:22.070]  I was looking, I was writing a review
[43:22.070 --> 43:24.910]  for a new strain the other day
[43:24.910 --> 43:27.550]  and I looked at the terpene data to, you know,
[43:27.550 --> 43:30.350]  kind of use it to write and I'm like,
[43:31.430 --> 43:33.950]  I've had this, I have it.
[43:33.950 --> 43:35.390]  It makes no sense,
[43:35.390 --> 43:37.750]  but I guess it's just really the combination
[43:37.750 --> 43:39.150]  of the terpenes.
[43:39.150 --> 43:40.870]  And again, I mean, I'm looking at lab data,
[43:40.870 --> 43:42.070]  so it's like, who am I?
[43:42.070 --> 43:46.070]  But yeah, it's sometimes it gets-
[43:46.070 --> 43:47.910]  Yeah, I don't even know.
[43:47.910 --> 43:51.590]  Fucking Amish, stop texting me, don't at me, bro.
[43:51.590 --> 43:55.110]  Doing a fucking show, you fucking prick.
[43:55.110 --> 43:57.550]  I'm not gonna say anything either.
[43:57.550 --> 43:58.950]  I don't even know where you're seeing this.
[43:58.950 --> 44:02.510]  Like I'm looking at our chat for some guy named Amish
[44:02.510 --> 44:04.190]  and I'm like, I don't even see it.
[44:04.230 --> 44:06.830]  No, I got like my own little private asshole chat
[44:06.830 --> 44:08.790]  called text messaging to my phone
[44:08.790 --> 44:10.430]  because like I'm on my phone right now
[44:10.430 --> 44:12.910]  and fucking dies, man.
[44:12.910 --> 44:14.710]  You gave out the number.
[44:14.710 --> 44:16.190]  I don't know what to say there.
[44:16.190 --> 44:19.150]  Hey man, you know, that's how it is with the friends, man.
[44:19.150 --> 44:22.470]  They just like to fuck with me when I do this shit.
[44:22.470 --> 44:26.270]  I've gotten a few dick suit fucking times and everything.
[44:26.270 --> 44:27.550]  Yeah, it's cool.
[44:27.550 --> 44:29.030]  What's up, dudes?
[44:29.030 --> 44:33.710]  I need new friends in my life.
[44:33.750 --> 44:35.470]  Oh yeah, give me your number, dude.
[44:35.470 --> 44:36.310]  Hell no.
[44:38.030 --> 44:42.230]  Never, never exchange numbers.
[44:43.350 --> 44:44.710]  Yeah, never, dude.
[44:44.710 --> 44:46.510]  Yeah, you never wanna do that, man.
[44:47.590 --> 44:48.430]  Yeah.
[44:48.430 --> 44:50.350]  I'm coming to your town, man,
[44:50.350 --> 44:51.550]  with a whole box of beans.
[44:51.550 --> 44:52.390]  You want them?
[44:52.390 --> 44:53.870]  Just let me know where to meet you.
[44:53.870 --> 44:55.390]  Send me a text.
[44:55.390 --> 44:56.710]  Yeah, yeah.
[44:56.710 --> 44:59.710]  Safe way, safe way.
[44:59.710 --> 45:01.710]  How do you know about the safe way, bro?
[45:04.070 --> 45:06.150]  Is that universal?
[45:06.150 --> 45:07.070]  Yeah, man.
[45:07.070 --> 45:09.230]  So like out here, it's at the safe way.
[45:09.230 --> 45:10.790]  Like back in the day,
[45:10.790 --> 45:14.630]  there was a Merchant's Walk shopping center in Richmond.
[45:14.630 --> 45:16.510]  It was like a good meetup spot.
[45:16.510 --> 45:19.550]  The Roses in Ashland by the food line.
[45:19.550 --> 45:23.310]  And then there was another Roses off of Warwick Boulevard
[45:23.310 --> 45:25.550]  in fucking Newport News.
[45:25.550 --> 45:28.310]  Those are like a few of the meetup spots
[45:28.310 --> 45:32.110]  to get your shit and keep it moving.
[45:32.150 --> 45:34.030]  Yeah, we had, so safe way.
[45:34.030 --> 45:36.550]  Safe way was a grocery store chain
[45:36.550 --> 45:37.790]  out here on the West Coast.
[45:37.790 --> 45:38.790]  And it's, you know,
[45:39.710 --> 45:42.630]  allegedly sometimes it's almost safer
[45:42.630 --> 45:45.030]  to be fucking obvious in the middle of the day
[45:45.030 --> 45:47.830]  than it is to try to be fucking secretive about shit.
[45:47.830 --> 45:50.230]  So safe way.
[45:50.230 --> 45:51.630]  I'll see you at safe way.
[45:53.350 --> 45:54.950]  You just gotta hit them with it.
[45:54.950 --> 45:56.830]  Like, you know, you just gotta own it
[45:56.830 --> 45:58.710]  and look like you're supposed to be doing it.
[45:58.710 --> 46:00.150]  You know, it's like,
[46:00.190 --> 46:02.110]  no, no, no, I'm supposed to be here.
[46:02.110 --> 46:03.230]  I'm supposed to be here.
[46:03.230 --> 46:04.870]  Like get the fuck on.
[46:04.870 --> 46:06.470]  I'm with the bands.
[46:06.470 --> 46:08.670]  Yeah, man, just let me do my drug deal.
[46:08.670 --> 46:10.990]  You know, just get the fuck on somewhere, man.
[46:10.990 --> 46:11.990]  It's gotta be quick.
[46:12.910 --> 46:15.510]  An attitude can get you places in life for sure.
[46:16.350 --> 46:18.750]  Yeah, mainly prison.
[46:23.670 --> 46:25.230]  Not a good spot.
[46:25.230 --> 46:28.070]  Yeah, well, you know, it's all depends.
[46:28.070 --> 46:32.150]  So yeah, I had so many fakes names skateboarding too.
[46:32.150 --> 46:34.630]  Cause you'd be amazed at how many times
[46:34.630 --> 46:36.670]  adults would be like, I'm gonna call the cops.
[46:36.670 --> 46:37.510]  What's your name?
[46:38.430 --> 46:39.710]  Really?
[46:39.710 --> 46:40.550]  Tom Fullery.
[46:40.550 --> 46:42.190]  Tom fucking Fullery.
[46:42.190 --> 46:43.390]  Exactly, really?
[46:43.390 --> 46:44.230]  Dick Carter.
[46:44.230 --> 46:45.070]  Really?
[46:45.070 --> 46:46.470]  Yeah.
[46:46.470 --> 46:47.310]  Mike Hunt.
[46:49.030 --> 46:50.590]  I was Steve Pool a lot.
[46:50.590 --> 46:52.070]  That was the local weatherman
[46:52.070 --> 46:53.870]  and none of them fucking ever caught it.
[46:53.870 --> 46:56.110]  They're like, all right, Steve, you stay here.
[46:57.110 --> 46:57.950]  We'll do.
[46:57.950 --> 46:58.790]  Okay.
[46:58.790 --> 46:59.630]  Yeah.
[46:59.630 --> 47:00.470]  Yeah.
[47:00.470 --> 47:01.310]  Okay.
[47:01.310 --> 47:04.430]  Got a forecast coming for about four inches right here.
[47:04.430 --> 47:06.110]  Yeah, there you go.
[47:06.110 --> 47:06.950]  Now.
[47:09.950 --> 47:11.390]  Oh shit.
[47:11.390 --> 47:12.710]  Oh shit.
[47:12.710 --> 47:13.550]  Well.
[47:13.550 --> 47:14.990]  Go ahead and whip the old.
[47:14.990 --> 47:15.830]  Now.
[47:15.830 --> 47:16.670]  Right?
[47:16.670 --> 47:19.190]  Oh man, we were jackass before jackass
[47:19.190 --> 47:20.950]  was actually a show.
[47:20.950 --> 47:21.790]  Pretty much.
[47:23.510 --> 47:24.590]  But.
[47:25.270 --> 47:26.790]  Johnny Knoxville earlier,
[47:26.790 --> 47:29.950]  fucking is talking about motherfucking
[47:31.270 --> 47:34.510]  a walleye fishing tournament or whatever.
[47:35.550 --> 47:37.670]  And these guys got in trouble.
[47:37.670 --> 47:39.430]  Like it's like a big tournament.
[47:39.430 --> 47:41.470]  And like, they were like suspected
[47:41.470 --> 47:43.590]  of like cheating at these tournaments.
[47:43.590 --> 47:47.030]  And yeah, they won like five or six in a row
[47:47.030 --> 47:48.590]  and they're doing a way in.
[47:48.590 --> 47:50.110]  And like the shit's like adding up
[47:50.110 --> 47:51.470]  like way more than they should.
[47:51.470 --> 47:53.030]  And they like cut open the fish
[47:53.070 --> 47:56.550]  and fucking like a half pound fucking lead weight.
[47:56.550 --> 47:59.150]  They were like shoving lead weights sinkers,
[47:59.150 --> 48:01.590]  you know, down these fishes throat,
[48:01.590 --> 48:03.230]  you know, before they fucking, you know,
[48:03.230 --> 48:04.910]  took them to the way in and everything.
[48:04.910 --> 48:08.110]  And they got caught and fucking all these fishermen
[48:08.110 --> 48:09.870]  were like getting ready to like beat their ass
[48:09.870 --> 48:11.190]  and everything.
[48:11.190 --> 48:13.190]  People were heated man.
[48:13.190 --> 48:16.350]  And I understand why, but people were really,
[48:16.350 --> 48:17.910]  I'm surprised they didn't get punched.
[48:17.910 --> 48:20.070]  I mean, that's kind of a crowd that just like fuck around
[48:20.070 --> 48:21.270]  and find out, you know.
[48:21.270 --> 48:22.470]  Yeah man.
[48:23.430 --> 48:27.470]  They were even stuffing fish fillets inside of the fish.
[48:27.470 --> 48:29.030]  I saw that.
[48:29.030 --> 48:31.150]  Like that's unreal.
[48:31.150 --> 48:33.670]  I mean, back in the camping days,
[48:33.670 --> 48:36.670]  we might maybe step on it to get it a little extra inch
[48:36.670 --> 48:39.590]  of length for the three, no, for the size contest.
[48:39.590 --> 48:42.590]  But you know, we're never stuffing weights down there.
[48:42.590 --> 48:45.630]  Well, I think they had upwards of like 500 grand
[48:45.630 --> 48:47.590]  in prize money that they had won already
[48:47.590 --> 48:49.070]  within this past year.
[48:49.070 --> 48:50.830]  So it's a lot of money on the lines.
[48:50.830 --> 48:52.110]  That's why people are pissed.
[48:52.750 --> 48:54.670]  You're winning a local fishing contest.
[48:54.670 --> 48:55.510]  Who cares?
[48:55.510 --> 48:56.510]  You know, whatever.
[48:56.510 --> 49:00.150]  But you know, this is professional fishing tournaments.
[49:00.150 --> 49:03.150]  And like I said, unbelievable.
[49:03.150 --> 49:07.270]  Surprised none of them got punched.
[49:07.270 --> 49:08.590]  But.
[49:08.590 --> 49:11.150]  Yeah, one of my buddies, he's on the Bassmaster tour.
[49:11.150 --> 49:14.110]  Like he's been on that for shit like 10 years.
[49:14.110 --> 49:15.510]  You know, I'm like, yeah,
[49:15.510 --> 49:17.790]  it's a lot of fucking money in that shit.
[49:17.790 --> 49:20.230]  I was like, man, wrong trade.
[49:21.230 --> 49:22.630]  There is, but okay.
[49:22.630 --> 49:25.030]  The Bassmaster's tour, like I get it.
[49:25.030 --> 49:25.870]  It's cool.
[49:25.870 --> 49:26.710]  I get fishing.
[49:26.710 --> 49:28.550]  I get competitive fishing.
[49:28.550 --> 49:31.030]  Everybody in chat, everybody on the panel.
[49:31.030 --> 49:32.590]  Let's settle this.
[49:32.590 --> 49:35.470]  Is fishing a sport?
[49:35.470 --> 49:36.990]  I'm gonna go with no.
[49:36.990 --> 49:38.710]  Because you sit on a fucking boat.
[49:39.590 --> 49:40.710]  Is fishing a sport?
[49:41.870 --> 49:45.310]  I could argue that certain fish are sport.
[49:45.310 --> 49:49.510]  Like, hey, spend four hours reeling in a marlin.
[49:49.910 --> 49:51.230]  That's okay.
[49:51.230 --> 49:53.990]  Bass, perch, trout.
[49:53.990 --> 49:57.470]  Doesn't it come down to like the competition aspect of it?
[49:57.470 --> 49:58.950]  You know what I mean?
[49:58.950 --> 50:01.790]  It's like technically like a professional
[50:01.790 --> 50:04.790]  is someone who gets paid to do something, right?
[50:04.790 --> 50:07.190]  So, you know.
[50:09.830 --> 50:11.790]  Yeah, so I would have to say yeah,
[50:11.790 --> 50:14.150]  because then it's like, you know,
[50:15.150 --> 50:18.310]  you know, there's a competition aspect to it, you know?
[50:19.550 --> 50:21.350]  It's a skill, not a sport, hobby.
[50:21.350 --> 50:22.190]  Okay, so.
[50:22.190 --> 50:26.790]  But if you see booth, there you go, right?
[50:26.790 --> 50:28.230]  Like it is a hobby, right?
[50:28.230 --> 50:33.230]  But if you do it competitively for like a prize, you know,
[50:34.430 --> 50:37.830]  then doesn't it become like a sport?
[50:37.830 --> 50:40.350]  It's like, how is our definition of sport?
[50:40.350 --> 50:41.750]  You know what I mean?
[50:41.750 --> 50:43.590]  Do you sweat?
[50:43.590 --> 50:46.110]  Okay, I guess, I guess, I guess.
[50:46.110 --> 50:46.950]  All right.
[50:46.990 --> 50:49.990]  I guess if it is bowling is too.
[50:49.990 --> 50:52.510]  And yes, curling absolutely is a sport.
[50:52.510 --> 50:54.310]  Those people sweep hard.
[50:54.310 --> 50:55.150]  Yes, they do.
[50:55.150 --> 50:56.390]  Yes, they do.
[50:56.390 --> 50:58.910]  Would NASCAR be a sport then by your logic?
[50:58.910 --> 51:00.950]  No, they just go left.
[51:01.950 --> 51:05.430]  Go real fast, I'm gonna turn to the left.
[51:07.670 --> 51:09.790]  So I actually changed the bubbles there
[51:09.790 --> 51:12.270]  to bring up real questions about seeds.
[51:12.270 --> 51:15.070]  I had to get that tangent in while I could.
[51:15.590 --> 51:17.950]  What about skateboarding, right?
[51:17.950 --> 51:20.550]  Skateboarding is definitely a sport, man.
[51:20.550 --> 51:24.990]  Physical skills, mental skills, blood, sweat, tears.
[51:24.990 --> 51:26.550]  For sure, for sure.
[51:26.550 --> 51:28.110]  I played pro paintball.
[51:28.110 --> 51:29.230]  That was a sport.
[51:29.230 --> 51:31.350]  That hurts, dude.
[51:31.350 --> 51:33.270]  Yeah, feels good.
[51:33.270 --> 51:35.270]  People take that pretty serious.
[51:35.270 --> 51:36.990]  Oh yeah, for sure.
[51:36.990 --> 51:40.350]  The guy asked about the Savage headband, what that's like.
[51:40.390 --> 51:44.990]  Fucking real fucking limey tennis ball,
[51:44.990 --> 51:46.990]  kind of a sour funk.
[51:46.990 --> 51:48.950]  Yields crazy good.
[51:48.950 --> 51:51.150]  The stretch is like hella productive.
[51:51.150 --> 51:53.670]  So like, you know, you do get the stretch,
[51:53.670 --> 51:55.390]  but it stacks up along the way.
[51:55.390 --> 51:56.670]  So you don't have a whole bunch
[51:56.670 --> 51:59.950]  of like unproductive middle spacing, you know.
[51:59.950 --> 52:03.350]  And yeah, it punch you right in the fucking brain too.
[52:03.350 --> 52:07.430]  Like it'll definitely stupefy you.
[52:07.430 --> 52:10.070]  Stupefy you, nice, Savage headband.
[52:10.790 --> 52:13.790]  And what was the cross there?
[52:13.790 --> 52:16.510]  It's a figure four to the headband.
[52:16.510 --> 52:20.950]  So the figure four is the TK to the ass man,
[52:20.950 --> 52:25.470]  which was the Airborne G13 Skelly skunk hybrid.
[52:25.470 --> 52:26.390]  Nice.
[52:26.390 --> 52:29.070]  Added a lot of strong branching and everything
[52:29.070 --> 52:32.710]  to everything that it hit too.
[52:33.910 --> 52:37.430]  Nice, and someone, Roman Numerals,
[52:37.430 --> 52:39.830]  was asking too about the headband
[52:39.830 --> 52:42.230]  that you used in the skunk band versions.
[52:42.230 --> 52:45.710]  If you had any info with that one.
[52:45.710 --> 52:49.230]  Yes, that's like been like this weird like topic lately.
[52:49.230 --> 52:52.870]  And it's like all the headbands that like started coming
[52:52.870 --> 52:55.350]  like out in like, I don't know,
[52:55.350 --> 52:58.310]  I guess like the last five to 10 years, you know,
[52:58.310 --> 53:00.630]  people like which one's what and this and that.
[53:00.630 --> 53:03.390]  So the only thing I can say is it's the old one
[53:03.390 --> 53:06.510]  that came out of fucking New York way, way back in the day
[53:06.510 --> 53:08.870]  before there was area code headbands
[53:08.870 --> 53:11.430]  and named headbands and this and that.
[53:11.430 --> 53:15.670]  So when people ask that, I don't know what the answer
[53:15.670 --> 53:19.190]  because like I haven't grown any other plants,
[53:19.190 --> 53:20.390]  you know, called headband
[53:20.390 --> 53:22.790]  or really had any experience with the other ones.
[53:22.790 --> 53:27.790]  So yeah, just old plain old East Coast headband.
[53:28.150 --> 53:30.270]  Yeah, no, that's a great answer too.
[53:30.270 --> 53:32.710]  Because I mean, it's not really possible
[53:32.710 --> 53:35.030]  to run or see everything.
[53:35.030 --> 53:36.870]  And something that, you know,
[53:36.870 --> 53:41.870]  I'm doing just a little video on my channel
[53:42.230 --> 53:45.910]  is just about, you know, provenance,
[53:45.910 --> 53:47.670]  like following the seeds.
[53:47.670 --> 53:50.270]  There's so many companies out there,
[53:50.270 --> 53:55.030]  just mass seed producers that will put the headband's name
[53:55.030 --> 53:56.830]  on some white label seeds.
[53:56.830 --> 54:00.870]  And then the person who gets that no fault of their own
[54:00.870 --> 54:03.270]  generally thinks they have headband.
[54:03.350 --> 54:05.190]  And then they take a cut and they pass it.
[54:05.190 --> 54:08.310]  It's like back in the day, like if you tell me like,
[54:08.310 --> 54:10.590]  hey, I'm growing sour, I'm like, all right, cool.
[54:10.590 --> 54:12.670]  I don't ask you like which cut.
[54:12.670 --> 54:14.150]  Like motherfucker, there was one,
[54:14.150 --> 54:17.230]  there was a sour diesel, not multiples of,
[54:17.230 --> 54:20.230]  but like now, goddamn, like I don't even know
[54:20.230 --> 54:21.950]  how many of them there are.
[54:21.950 --> 54:23.750]  And most of them don't taste sour.
[54:23.750 --> 54:24.750]  You know what I mean?
[54:24.750 --> 54:27.670]  And that was like the big distinguishing thing with it.
[54:27.670 --> 54:30.030]  Like, you know, there's a smell and there's a look,
[54:30.030 --> 54:31.430]  but that shit won't sour.
[54:31.470 --> 54:34.270]  Like, ain't fucking sour, you know?
[54:34.270 --> 54:35.710]  So I don't know.
[54:35.710 --> 54:38.230]  So it's kind of a fucked up game out there right now,
[54:38.230 --> 54:39.390]  for real.
[54:39.390 --> 54:42.430]  Like it kind of sucked to be getting into it right now,
[54:42.430 --> 54:45.070]  trying to figure heads from tails, you know?
[54:45.070 --> 54:47.230]  I'm sure Jack off and shit, fucking around,
[54:47.230 --> 54:50.030]  taking names and this and that, trying to make a dollar.
[54:50.910 --> 54:52.390]  Well, yeah, names, I mean,
[54:52.390 --> 54:54.950]  names are almost to the wayside anymore,
[54:54.950 --> 54:57.910]  unless you're talking with like a breeder like yourself
[54:57.910 --> 54:59.750]  or, you know, like breeder like me, Gene,
[54:59.750 --> 55:03.070]  someone who is intimately familiar with the line,
[55:03.070 --> 55:04.470]  they've worked the line,
[55:04.470 --> 55:07.710]  that you've not just splashed A and B together
[55:07.710 --> 55:08.750]  because they were hot
[55:08.750 --> 55:10.790]  and they came in the mail two months ago.
[55:11.870 --> 55:12.710]  That's-
[55:12.710 --> 55:13.830]  I'm gonna go call it Abba.
[55:14.830 --> 55:19.590]  Abba, Larry, Barry.
[55:20.350 --> 55:22.430]  Oh God, I forget the names of all of them.
[55:24.230 --> 55:27.390]  But yeah, no, and that's why I'm, you know,
[55:27.390 --> 55:28.990]  like I'm not convinced.
[55:29.110 --> 55:32.590]  I've had plenty of things that were called Acapulco Gold,
[55:32.590 --> 55:34.950]  but in my genuine heart,
[55:34.950 --> 55:37.510]  I'm not convinced I've really had Acapulco Gold before,
[55:37.510 --> 55:40.750]  because I don't have that frame of reference either.
[55:40.750 --> 55:41.950]  And a lot of people,
[55:41.950 --> 55:45.150]  oh, I got the, you know, I've got XYZ.
[55:45.150 --> 55:49.630]  So yeah, man, don't get disappointed
[55:49.630 --> 55:51.790]  because what the name says,
[55:51.790 --> 55:53.750]  or the pack's name isn't what it is.
[55:53.750 --> 55:56.030]  You still might find a treasure, but yeah,
[55:56.070 --> 55:59.750]  unless you're dealing direct with some of these breeders.
[55:59.750 --> 56:03.310]  Yeah, and you got like a lot of like real like shit bag
[56:03.310 --> 56:06.790]  people on the internet that'll try to like,
[56:06.790 --> 56:10.030]  they'll throw shade out there on legit shit,
[56:10.030 --> 56:13.550]  trying to pass off their Fugazi shit, right?
[56:13.550 --> 56:14.390]  Right.
[56:14.390 --> 56:15.510]  And it's one of those things,
[56:15.510 --> 56:18.110]  like I said it the other day and some dude was like,
[56:18.110 --> 56:19.790]  yeah, some famous Nazi said that.
[56:19.790 --> 56:20.790]  I was like, whoa.
[56:20.790 --> 56:23.390]  But it's something to the effect of like, you know,
[56:23.390 --> 56:26.350]  if somebody says a lie enough fucking times,
[56:26.350 --> 56:29.430]  it like starts to become true and accepted.
[56:29.430 --> 56:32.470]  And you know, there's quite a few of those out there
[56:32.470 --> 56:35.310]  and you gotta really be wary of those people
[56:35.310 --> 56:39.910]  because they're looking at your wallet pretty hard,
[56:39.910 --> 56:42.310]  you know, and it just,
[56:42.310 --> 56:45.230]  you got a lot of fucking weirdos out there in general,
[56:45.230 --> 56:49.350]  but especially like the weed game, seed game and whatnot.
[56:50.190 --> 56:51.030]  It's a lot of-
[56:51.030 --> 56:55.790]  Anywhere there's the thought of a quick buck, you're right.
[56:55.790 --> 57:00.270]  Is there, I mean, is there anything that we could do
[57:00.270 --> 57:05.270]  to maybe like identify or see these people for who they are
[57:05.390 --> 57:08.150]  or questions we can ask to maybe expose them?
[57:08.150 --> 57:11.950]  Like what is a question that somebody who bred a line
[57:11.950 --> 57:14.470]  would like, should be able to answer?
[57:14.470 --> 57:17.590]  Yeah, like, I mean, shit, if you just ask them like,
[57:17.590 --> 57:20.790]  for like your simple fly-by-night seed company,
[57:20.790 --> 57:22.870]  yeah, you could ask them about like the traits
[57:22.870 --> 57:26.190]  that they were looking for in the parents, you know,
[57:26.190 --> 57:28.310]  and how that they've been, you know,
[57:28.310 --> 57:29.910]  seen in the progeny and shit.
[57:29.910 --> 57:33.550]  Did they do like a recurrent selection process or,
[57:33.550 --> 57:36.830]  you know, ask them about the actual process of it.
[57:36.830 --> 57:38.630]  You can look at their timelines, you know,
[57:38.630 --> 57:42.350]  it's like, if you got a clone, you know, three months ago
[57:42.350 --> 57:44.510]  and you already got like a seed line out, you know,
[57:44.510 --> 57:48.230]  a month after that, like, that shit don't add up.
[57:48.230 --> 57:52.150]  With some of like the more in-depth fucking pieces of shit,
[57:52.150 --> 57:54.230]  like they've been doing it for so many years,
[57:54.230 --> 57:57.230]  but like people call them out, this and that,
[57:57.230 --> 58:00.110]  but between stoners and like, you know,
[58:00.110 --> 58:01.850]  the current situation of the world,
[58:01.850 --> 58:04.710]  people's got like real, real short-term memories.
[58:04.710 --> 58:07.550]  So it gets forgotten, a new group of idiots, you know,
[58:07.550 --> 58:10.110]  falls for it and it's just how it is.
[58:10.110 --> 58:13.310]  But I got a good solution to that though.
[58:13.310 --> 58:15.590]  It's like, I'm gonna get off fucking probation.
[58:15.590 --> 58:16.670]  I'm gonna see them at shows.
[58:16.670 --> 58:19.150]  I'm just gonna start stomping their fucking ass,
[58:19.150 --> 58:21.590]  treat it like a prison yard, you know, just run them off.
[58:21.590 --> 58:22.630]  You ain't welcome here.
[58:22.630 --> 58:24.510]  Get the fuck out of here.
[58:24.510 --> 58:26.350]  Yeah, yeah.
[58:26.350 --> 58:29.150]  You know, so you're welcome, everybody.
[58:29.150 --> 58:29.990]  You're welcome.
[58:31.030 --> 58:31.870]  Thank you.
[58:32.830 --> 58:35.030]  He's got to serve a dick soup for them all.
[58:35.030 --> 58:37.350]  Yeah, yeah.
[58:37.350 --> 58:39.350]  I mean, there's something to be said
[58:39.350 --> 58:43.950]  for the way business is conducted in the new market.
[58:43.950 --> 58:47.550]  Things are a little, everybody's got lawyers now,
[58:48.710 --> 58:52.430]  which is some bullshit, but yeah.
[58:52.430 --> 58:53.710]  So, okay, so that's good, man.
[58:53.710 --> 58:55.030]  People should be able to answer
[58:55.030 --> 58:56.710]  some of these just basic questions.
[58:56.710 --> 58:58.670]  And like you said, timeline is an important one.
[58:58.670 --> 59:00.230]  That's something that I see a lot.
[59:00.230 --> 59:03.070]  People will trip themselves up with Instagram of like,
[59:03.070 --> 59:06.550]  yo, got this cut, yo, pop these seeds.
[59:06.550 --> 59:08.110]  And you're right, three months later,
[59:08.110 --> 59:10.830]  all of a sudden they're ABC Seed Company.
[59:10.830 --> 59:15.310]  Yeah, Abba Seeds, it's all been tested for quality.
[59:17.190 --> 59:19.030]  It's real shitty, man.
[59:19.030 --> 59:22.990]  But like, you know, there's so many reputable ones out there
[59:22.990 --> 59:26.550]  and you got like such a diversity
[59:26.550 --> 59:29.710]  amongst like these very reputable people.
[59:29.710 --> 59:32.710]  Like everybody, shit, it's like, you know,
[59:32.710 --> 59:34.670]  it's got their own signature on it, you know?
[59:34.670 --> 59:36.910]  It's so, so unique.
[59:36.910 --> 59:37.950]  So like you said, you know,
[59:37.950 --> 59:40.510]  you got some of me and Gene's work,
[59:40.510 --> 59:42.830]  phenomenal fucking work, right?
[59:42.830 --> 59:45.830]  Barry's like very different from anything I'm gonna do.
[59:47.190 --> 59:50.190]  So you got some Swamp Boys, you know what I mean?
[59:50.190 --> 59:53.510]  Fucking totally, totally different, super awesome.
[59:53.510 --> 59:57.110]  So you got some Top Dog, dude, the list goes on and on.
[59:57.110 --> 01:00:00.470]  And like, you can really have some very solid things,
[01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:03.150]  but it kind of fucks it up for the new guy
[01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:05.630]  because you might have somebody who really is like
[01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:08.150]  putting in the work and the time and everything
[01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:10.830]  and they get overlooked because they're doing it,
[01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:13.270]  but the last hundred shit heels before them was,
[01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:15.990]  you know, fucking up, lying and, you know,
[01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:19.950]  doing some bullshit, so, and it's tough.
[01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:21.950]  And the people who put in the time
[01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:26.430]  to do proper breeding work risk missing that wave
[01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:28.990]  of the market for whatever particular trait
[01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:31.910]  that they're looking for, which is unfortunately
[01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:33.550]  why some people skip those,
[01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:37.750]  that important process of stabilizing a strain.
[01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:40.550]  Yeah, breeding for passion or breeding for profit.
[01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:42.910]  If you're breeding for the profit, like, yeah,
[01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:45.270]  like you gotta stay on top of that.
[01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:47.030]  But if it's more of a passion thing,
[01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:49.830]  then your timeline isn't gonna matter so much.
[01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:52.550]  It's gonna be the quality and the work that's, you know,
[01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:56.470]  put out and, you know, you might not be the most wealthy guy
[01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:58.110]  because of that, but you know what?
[01:00:58.110 --> 01:00:59.910]  You're wealthy in spirit, you know,
[01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:01.510]  chock full, that type of shit.
[01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:04.110]  So that's cool with me.
[01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:06.070]  Yeah, and knowledge and you've helped people too.
[01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:08.470]  And, you know, I think that was kind of one of the,
[01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:11.430]  you know, again, early on I got influenced by TGA.
[01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:13.790]  Just, I was like blown away by like, wow,
[01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:15.510]  weed has these kinds of flavors,
[01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:18.030]  but also just the medicinal aspect of,
[01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.590]  they were trying to really narrow in
[01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:23.630]  on specific medical conditions.
[01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:24.910]  And that was the goal.
[01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:26.830]  And it was just a happy circumstance
[01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:29.870]  that other people enjoyed the same strains.
[01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:33.190]  And that's kind of what I wanna do for myself too.
[01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.950]  I use cannabis medicinally and I am looking,
[01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:40.230]  always looking for the right one for my body.
[01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:44.030]  And once I find it, and if I can make it just that way,
[01:01:44.030 --> 01:01:46.790]  always, and other people happen to enjoy it, then cool.
[01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:48.990]  But that's a long ways off.
[01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:50.470]  That's a long ways off.
[01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:51.750]  And that's the thing, man, you'll find,
[01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:55.510]  especially like, you know, if you use something medicinally,
[01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:57.390]  like when you get relief from something,
[01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:01.870]  other people will feel that even more so.
[01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:02.710]  You know what I mean?
[01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:07.710]  So like, you're basically,
[01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:10.670]  I don't know, like you're really hitting
[01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:13.950]  those fine tuned things that are part of
[01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:17.630]  a much more complex effect, you know?
[01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:22.190]  So yeah, so if you dig it, there's a chance,
[01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:24.630]  a lot of other people are gonna dig it too, for sure.
[01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:25.750]  Yep, yep.
[01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:27.670]  And I'm glad, you know, both Dave
[01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:29.230]  and you kind of touched on it too.
[01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:32.710]  There's enough solid people out there that, you know,
[01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:36.750]  if I'm looking for a particular type of, you know, profile,
[01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:39.790]  I kind of know, oh, you know, this person really nails it.
[01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:43.950]  And you mentioned Swamp Boys, you know,
[01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:47.030]  maybe who are some of those people for you?
[01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:49.870]  Or maybe like, if you want, what are you looking for
[01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:51.870]  and why do you go to these people?
[01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:54.510]  And I know it's hard to think of everybody on the spot.
[01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:56.230]  So you'll probably forget somebody,
[01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:59.390]  but anything come to mind for you there?
[01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:00.550]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:05.950]  So yeah, like I would definitely grow out Minjin's stuff.
[01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:08.110]  I would grow out AK Beanbrain's stuff.
[01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:09.990]  I would grow out Swamp Boys stuff.
[01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:13.350]  I would grow out, let's see here.
[01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:17.270]  See his texts with these fucking guys.
[01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:21.110]  Fuck you Bumbles, I'll fucking behave myself.
[01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:21.950]  Anyways.
[01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:24.190]  You need a second phone, man.
[01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:25.710]  Yeah, I know, right?
[01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:28.670]  Like I'm just gonna start giving the burner number out.
[01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:29.510]  For real.
[01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:31.630]  I'll talk about what I want to.
[01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:34.070]  Okay, and I'm, and there's fucking people.
[01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:38.030]  Anyways, Top Dog, you know, I'd grow some of his stuff.
[01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:42.070]  I saw like when y'all were putting up your advertising
[01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:45.910]  for the Seed Bank there, I got me some nerds right here.
[01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:46.750]  Nice.
[01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:47.710]  That's another one.
[01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:49.590]  Definitely got the Day Tripper.
[01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:55.430]  So like there's a lot of like really good stuff out there.
[01:03:55.470 --> 01:04:00.470]  It's just, you know, it gets overlooked, you know.
[01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:04.070]  So, but yeah, like I said,
[01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:07.670]  all very reputable people and everything.
[01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:13.790]  Very good quality stuff that have come out of it.
[01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:18.630]  And yeah, I can't say enough about,
[01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:23.630]  you know, some of the people I just mentioned.
[01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:26.390]  Like, let's see here.
[01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:30.590]  Yeah, it's like that silver bag's definitely full
[01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:33.290]  of a lot of cool things here.
[01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:37.710]  Jeez Louise, I got so much shit in here.
[01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:39.510]  This is like why I need like one of those
[01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:42.030]  like big, big gnarly facilities, man.
[01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:44.070]  So I can just like pop everything at once
[01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:47.310]  and get rocking and rolling, you know.
[01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:49.790]  I hope you find something you've totally forgot about
[01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:51.510]  that's like, holy shit, I need to pop this now.
[01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:54.110]  Like that's what I'm kind of hoping happens tonight.
[01:04:54.110 --> 01:04:57.590]  Yeah, so like just out of the AK Bean Reins,
[01:04:57.590 --> 01:05:01.790]  we got TK by NL5 Hayes.
[01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:02.630]  Nice.
[01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:04.670]  We got NL5 by Big Skunk.
[01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:07.190]  Let's see here.
[01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:09.710]  And like all this, I'll be getting to this winter.
[01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:12.390]  Got Williams Wonder.
[01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:13.510]  Nice.
[01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.270]  And like I said, this is like all stuff
[01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.870]  other people can get too.
[01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:21.310]  Yeah, those are on the dagga.garden website actually.
[01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:23.070]  Oh yeah, perfect, man.
[01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:24.670]  NL2 by five.
[01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:28.390]  Let's see here.
[01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:29.950]  He hooked it up, man.
[01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:32.630]  Okay, and I just got back from the halfway house.
[01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:34.070]  I got some NL1.
[01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:38.910]  Oh yeah, it's gonna be a cool winter.
[01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:40.610]  Got the Durven F4.
[01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:45.190]  We got, let's see here.
[01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:48.110]  Bush Bros Freezeland.
[01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:50.790]  Don't know what it is, but he sent it.
[01:05:50.790 --> 01:05:52.390]  So I know it's gonna be good.
[01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:57.270]  NL5 Hayes F4, definitely all about that.
[01:05:58.710 --> 01:06:01.030]  Got a pack of the, look at that.
[01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:04.150]  Look at that, Dave, we're twins, bud.
[01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.990]  Yeah.
[01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:05.830]  Yeah.
[01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:08.390]  It was hiding in there.
[01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:10.510]  We got some Beatrix Choice.
[01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:12.350]  That's gonna be super good.
[01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:16.350]  Hopefully I get one of the good bubble gum ones out of that.
[01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:20.230]  Let's see here, M48 African Hayes.
[01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:21.950]  That'll be cool.
[01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:23.470]  Bean Granger, the man.
[01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:25.190]  Oh yeah.
[01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:26.030]  NL hybrid.
[01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:29.030]  Yeah, fuck, man.
[01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:30.790]  Things like Santa's bag.
[01:06:30.790 --> 01:06:34.430]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and this is just from him, you know.
[01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:37.510]  Yeah, NL5s, yeah.
[01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:41.310]  Yeah, man, so all that stuff, it's all on deck.
[01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:42.910]  He was a good dude.
[01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:47.910]  It was a five and a half hour show we did together here
[01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:50.910]  on FCP, that was a fun conversation.
[01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:54.030]  He's just a fascinating person in general,
[01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:55.950]  but he breeds like chickens.
[01:06:55.950 --> 01:07:00.150]  Like right now he's got a Shetland chickling, I believe,
[01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:04.790]  but it's basically almost extinct and he's bringing it back
[01:07:04.790 --> 01:07:06.790]  and he's making eggs and he's getting them out.
[01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:09.670]  So like breeding has been a passion
[01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:12.110]  for this man for a long time.
[01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:13.670]  Yeah, yeah, it really is.
[01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:16.190]  That might grow in really good weed.
[01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:20.830]  And yeah, just really, really cool fucking guy too, man.
[01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:23.830]  Just real solid, solid, nice fellow.
[01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:26.790]  And yeah, so like that would be something
[01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:29.670]  I would really recommend for somebody that's like,
[01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:32.470]  yeah, if you're looking for something different
[01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:35.430]  and something of that old school, you know,
[01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:38.350]  that would definitely be a guy, you know.
[01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:40.270]  Definitely wanna get some of that.
[01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:41.550]  Nice, hitting that up.
[01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:44.350]  We got a peace of mind farming, what's up?
[01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:48.470]  Asking any screaming eagle in the bag.
[01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:50.390]  Yeah, there's some in here.
[01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:52.030]  There is some in here.
[01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:53.790]  There's a-
[01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:56.190]  The screaming eagle is your work, correct?
[01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:57.670]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:57.670 --> 01:07:59.010]  That's all me, buddy.
[01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:00.790]  Yes, sir.
[01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:04.950]  Have you ever had the instance like we almost had here
[01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:07.710]  where Dave or like somebody else has something,
[01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:09.350]  and you're like, you know, I made that.
[01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:11.150]  I don't have it, wish I did.
[01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:15.350]  I've seen that.
[01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:17.110]  Somebody's had like one of my CDs before.
[01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:18.550]  I'm like, oh dude, I haven't heard that.
[01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:20.990]  You know, I haven't listened to that CD for years.
[01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:22.110]  They're like, yeah, I got it.
[01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:23.550]  I'm like, yeah.
[01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:24.750]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:26.870]  Yeah, no, I've always been good.
[01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:31.430]  Like I've kept things like backed up, you know.
[01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:33.670]  I had like a few friends, anything I ever made,
[01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:36.550]  I'd send them, you know, 100 seeds to each one of them
[01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:39.110]  and they won't grow them, but they'll hold onto them
[01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:41.590]  for me, you know, just in case.
[01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:44.730]  So always got shit backed up around the board.
[01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:46.470]  Nice.
[01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:48.150]  Very important.
[01:08:48.150 --> 01:08:49.590]  Now I got a question for you.
[01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:52.310]  You did a collab with AK Beanbrains,
[01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:54.030]  the Thunderhole, right?
[01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:55.550]  Oh yeah, yep.
[01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:57.670]  Are you gonna do any more collabs with him
[01:08:57.670 --> 01:09:00.110]  or with anyone else or anything like that in the works?
[01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:02.750]  Or are you still working on your own projects?
[01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:04.650]  Tell us more about Thunderhole too.
[01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:10.170]  So Thunderhole was during the Figure Four project.
[01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:14.370]  I was making the Figure Four, so taking the ass man
[01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:19.370]  and Beanbrains had sent me his, the MTF clone.
[01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:23.810]  And I just thought it would be like super cool.
[01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:26.450]  I would just, you know, make some seeds with it
[01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:28.330]  and then hook him back up.
[01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:30.850]  You know, it wasn't like meant to like be a release
[01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:31.690]  or anything like that.
[01:09:31.690 --> 01:09:34.330]  It was just, this would be really nice
[01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:35.970]  and just shoot him back to them.
[01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:40.610]  So that way, you know, he would be able to do his thing
[01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:42.930]  if he wanted, you know.
[01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:45.330]  And it turned around, he was really digging it.
[01:09:46.330 --> 01:09:47.170]  Nice.
[01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:49.930]  And then Dave was saying, any future collabs
[01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:52.850]  or is that one gonna keep kind of moving forward?
[01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:55.150]  It sounds like on his end at this point.
[01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:58.190]  Yeah, like stuff with like me and him,
[01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:01.990]  been talking, doing like,
[01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:08.550]  I guess it's like, so Lemon Hoka,
[01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:12.590]  he's another dude I'd like to be doing some work with.
[01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:15.790]  And there's a long list, yeah.
[01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:16.630]  Nice.
[01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:21.150]  It's just like right now, it's like doing my own projects,
[01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:24.830]  but also all the other shit going on too.
[01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:26.710]  It's like kind of at the same time.
[01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:28.110]  Cause some of it's like,
[01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:30.230]  hey, I need to like donate pollen for this.
[01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:32.550]  So I'll have to collect it and then I'll shoot it to them
[01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:35.430]  and then they can do it at their own pace.
[01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:38.510]  Or they've sent a clone and I'm just waiting for it
[01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:41.350]  and you know, do it the other way.
[01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:42.190]  So.
[01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:45.790]  That's fun too, especially with, you know,
[01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:47.950]  people who have been working with certain plants
[01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:50.990]  for a while, you kind of get the benefit
[01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:52.790]  of all of their work.
[01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:55.590]  They get the benefit of your work and you're coming together
[01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:58.870]  cause you have a good relationship for everybody's benefit.
[01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:01.110]  But I always say that about, you know, like grow knowledge.
[01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:03.750]  It's the more we share, the better we get
[01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:07.270]  because there's only so many runs you get per year.
[01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:08.110]  Yeah.
[01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:09.910]  But when you collab like that.
[01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:12.230]  Yeah. Then you make friend of ours.
[01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:15.590]  Those are the best type of cult of ours, a friend of ours.
[01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:16.430]  Yes.
[01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:21.550]  Is that you wrestling in the background, Dave?
[01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:23.230]  What are you looking for?
[01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:25.830]  Well, he mentioned one of my other favorite people.
[01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:27.150]  I love Lemon Hogan.
[01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:28.750]  He's just a great dude.
[01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:29.950]  Yeah, he really is.
[01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:31.750]  He's from Washington.
[01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:33.270]  So I always, you know, I always root
[01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:34.910]  for the Washington people.
[01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:38.030]  I've had the chance to kind of talk with him.
[01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:39.710]  Great conversation.
[01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:44.230]  And funny enough, like we were probably only two,
[01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:47.310]  one or two degrees separated back in the day
[01:11:47.310 --> 01:11:48.830]  with the stories he's telling
[01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:50.230]  and the things that I remember.
[01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:53.270]  I'm like, dude, we were like one
[01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:55.430]  or two steps separated this whole time
[01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:59.190]  and it took us 20 something years to figure it out.
[01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:01.670]  Oh yeah.
[01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:05.190]  Yeah. He's been around, man.
[01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:08.430]  He was a busy dude, you know?
[01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:09.430]  Like, yeah.
[01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:11.630]  Yeah. He was one of them guys who was getting
[01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:14.790]  in way back in the day and, you know
[01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:17.750]  still getting it into this current day.
[01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:20.070]  Yeah. Dave just isn't stopping, man.
[01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:21.590]  Are you throwing out repeats there
[01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:24.870]  or is there really this wide of a selection?
[01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:26.150]  There's a pretty wide selection.
[01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:27.750]  There were a couple of repeats.
[01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:32.150]  He's been very generous to me.
[01:12:32.150 --> 01:12:33.350]  I'll say that much.
[01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.670]  He's hooked me up a few times.
[01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:38.150]  Awesome. Yeah.
[01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:40.470]  That looks like the entire, you know
[01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:42.150]  collect them all collection.
[01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:46.870]  I know he was working the double D for a while.
[01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:50.310]  Cause I was like, you know, I love, I love my chems.
[01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:52.030]  He was working with the chem double D.
[01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:53.590]  I believe it was.
[01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:54.950]  They were just in testing.
[01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:56.510]  They were in testing at that point though.
[01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:59.270]  Can't really see it, but there's the triple D.
[01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:00.350]  Triple D.
[01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:02.910]  Then they call that one Dolly Parton or something.
[01:13:04.190 --> 01:13:05.270]  I believe so.
[01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:06.510]  I believe so.
[01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:08.430]  Cause he's put it in a few things now.
[01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:13.070]  Is it, is that one add size
[01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:16.510]  or do you know anything about the kind of the morphology
[01:13:17.150 --> 01:13:18.390]  or how that one grows Dave?
[01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:22.310]  I would love to pop it and let you know myself
[01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:26.510]  but I can't sit here and lie and pretend like I have.
[01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:28.550]  Oh, it's okay Dave.
[01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:29.870]  We know you.
[01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:34.150]  It'd be another good dude to have on here.
[01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:36.910]  Cause I know, you know, doing his thing as long as he has
[01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:41.390]  you know, he's got a wide assortment of goods.
[01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:43.390]  Right? Yeah.
[01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:44.750]  No, good idea.
[01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:45.670]  Good idea.
[01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:46.790]  I'm going to write that down.
[01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:49.590]  I'm going to be like, I was so genius.
[01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:51.870]  I thought of asking them in Hoco the other day.
[01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:52.870]  No.
[01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:54.030]  Yeah.
[01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:57.110]  Just tell them Tommy threw him under the bus.
[01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.950]  All right.
[01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:00.110]  Right sir.
[01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:01.590]  You have some explaining to do.
[01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:05.470]  Exactly.
[01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:07.350]  Exactly man.
[01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:08.190]  Yeah.
[01:14:08.190 --> 01:14:09.030]  Yeah.
[01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:11.350]  It's like a side, there's so much,
[01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:13.190]  there's so much variety out there
[01:14:13.230 --> 01:14:16.230]  of like good things that, you know,
[01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:19.670]  it just, yeah.
[01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:21.230]  Yeah.
[01:14:21.230 --> 01:14:22.510]  I got some new ones here.
[01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:24.990]  You were talking a lot, a lot of the NLs
[01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:27.190]  from AK Bean Brains there.
[01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:28.870]  I've got, I got a new tester here.
[01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:31.070]  It's the Pure Michigan Lights.
[01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:34.190]  I don't know Dave, it's your general area of the country.
[01:14:34.190 --> 01:14:36.390]  I'm not sure if you've seen this one yet
[01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:38.310]  but this just came to me.
[01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:39.590]  Definitely heard of Pure Michigan.
[01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:41.030]  Definitely heard of Pure Michigan.
[01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:43.790]  I would imagine that's Pure Michigan and Northern Lights.
[01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:45.870]  That's what I would assume.
[01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:46.950]  That's what I would assume then.
[01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:47.790]  So, okay.
[01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:49.190]  So Pure Michigan is one that I'm looking
[01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:51.670]  to find a little more information on.
[01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:54.350]  I'll have to get out there on the interwebs
[01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:56.910]  but you know, Northern Lights,
[01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:59.430]  lights crosses are always nice.
[01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:00.470]  Oh yeah.
[01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:01.870]  Never knew what you get
[01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:04.310]  but usually what you get is pretty consistent.
[01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:07.390]  So I'm gonna have to learn a little bit more
[01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:08.790]  about that Pure Michigan.
[01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:11.350]  That was, this was one recently.
[01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:15.190]  I only got a few mail calls since the last show
[01:15:15.190 --> 01:15:17.190]  but this was one that came in since the last show.
[01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:19.190]  And I'm stoked on that.
[01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:20.030]  Oh yeah.
[01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:21.030]  Oh yeah.
[01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:23.030]  Another one that pulled out,
[01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:27.070]  it's off as a F3 Cali Mist.
[01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:30.430]  Oh, the elusive one.
[01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:31.390]  Yeah.
[01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:33.150]  So thank you, Grady.
[01:15:33.150 --> 01:15:35.190]  They're going down in the,
[01:15:35.190 --> 01:15:37.230]  going down this winter time, man.
[01:15:37.230 --> 01:15:38.590]  So. Very nice.
[01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:41.350]  That'd be another really cool one there.
[01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:43.550]  So many, man.
[01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:44.390]  So many.
[01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:47.550]  I've always liked this person's name.
[01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:48.710]  It's Huge Assel.
[01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:50.590]  Cause he's a huge hassle.
[01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:51.430]  Not really.
[01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:52.270]  That's just his name.
[01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:56.070]  But Pure Michigan equals Oreos times Mendo Breath.
[01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.910]  That would be interesting.
[01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:58.830]  I know I like Mendo Breath.
[01:15:58.830 --> 01:16:01.670]  Never tried Oreos myself.
[01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:04.670]  I know that's a pretty popular one at the moment
[01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:06.430]  but I do know Mendo Breath
[01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:07.710]  and I like enjoy Mendo Breath.
[01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:11.590]  So thank you very much.
[01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:12.830]  There you go.
[01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:15.990]  See, crowd, crowdsourcing the information.
[01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:17.150]  Love it.
[01:16:17.150 --> 01:16:18.190]  Exactly, man.
[01:16:18.190 --> 01:16:19.430]  Saved you the time.
[01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:23.950]  Pure Michigan F2 from Third Coast.
[01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:24.790]  Okay.
[01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:28.710]  This is probably one of the best answers I'll get.
[01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:33.350]  Kazoo, thank you very much, buddy.
[01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:36.510]  Pure Michigan F2 from Third Coast.
[01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:38.550]  So that showed up in the meantime.
[01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:42.590]  Dave, what's your mailbox look like, man, lately?
[01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:44.430]  Well, one of the most recent acquisitions
[01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:45.590]  is actually this right here.
[01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:47.470]  The Dead Band.
[01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:49.270]  Dead Band.
[01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:51.150]  I am a lucky fucker.
[01:16:51.150 --> 01:16:53.310]  I just heard a lucky fucker.
[01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:55.790]  Tell us, why is he a lucky fucker?
[01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:58.110]  No, there wasn't that many of them to begin with
[01:16:58.110 --> 01:17:00.550]  but I just held onto a few
[01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:04.230]  and I was gonna put one up for the Discord auction
[01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:06.670]  just to keep everybody kinda entertained.
[01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:10.950]  I needed to get rid of a couple of rescue dogs
[01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:12.750]  or coyote hybrids
[01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:14.950]  and the dude really wanted some Dead Bands.
[01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:16.150]  I was like, fuck, man.
[01:17:16.150 --> 01:17:18.310]  So they were already bidding on them.
[01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:23.030]  So I gave a pack of Dead Band and two coyote dogs to a guy
[01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:25.550]  and then Dave got the other one,
[01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:26.790]  bidded on it and got it.
[01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:31.270]  Super, super good.
[01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:34.670]  Wasn't it Dog's Days who got those pups?
[01:17:34.670 --> 01:17:35.870]  Yeah, sure did.
[01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:37.190]  Yeah, he's in chat too.
[01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:38.190]  It's perfect.
[01:17:38.190 --> 01:17:39.910]  Oh, yeah, he got that.
[01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:42.550]  Yeah, worked out well for him, man.
[01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:45.150]  Yeah, yeah, it was fucking cool.
[01:17:45.150 --> 01:17:48.670]  So there's a spot out in Maryland
[01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:51.550]  outside of Baltimore called Evermore
[01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:53.470]  and my buddy, he works there
[01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:54.990]  and I gave him those seeds
[01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:57.830]  before I even released any of the facts
[01:17:57.830 --> 01:18:00.870]  and they grow it there at their big grow-in dispensary
[01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:03.990]  and it's one of the most popular things they got.
[01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:05.470]  Yield's fucking huge too.
[01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:10.470]  So invite me to y'all's yacht party when you get it.
[01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:11.670]  Yacht party.
[01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:15.830]  Oh, yeah, Bites and Hoes, man.
[01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:19.150]  Oh, man, I love it.
[01:18:20.150 --> 01:18:22.510]  Forgot who I was talking about.
[01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:23.550]  Off subject.
[01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:27.350]  Off subject.
[01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:29.430]  Oh, right, I know.
[01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:33.750]  The more I smoke, the less I care.
[01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.310]  Oh, yeah, exactly.
[01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:38.790]  Not paying attention.
[01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:39.910]  What are we doing here?
[01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:41.470]  No, I'm just joking.
[01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:42.590]  I don't know, man.
[01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:47.350]  And Sean McAllister, no, you are not bidding on these.
[01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:52.590]  173, no.
[01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:53.670]  Start typing it.
[01:18:53.670 --> 01:18:56.870]  Well, we have had some auctions here lately on SCP
[01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:59.990]  and I believe we've got another one coming up,
[01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:02.710]  which Johnny plays 350.
[01:19:02.710 --> 01:19:06.150]  No, guys, no, no, no.
[01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:09.990]  He gets the joke, he's in on it.
[01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:15.230]  Seed Collectors episodes, episode nine.
[01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:19.430]  This has been a fun show and I'm glad that we have you
[01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:23.750]  on Duke because it's fun to get the breeder perspective,
[01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:26.710]  actually talk to the person who made a lot of these things
[01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:28.950]  on the show, because we have a lot of people in chat
[01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:30.750]  that have run your stuff.
[01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:34.190]  Obviously Dave's a collector as well.
[01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:38.070]  And I'm a fashionista, so.
[01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:39.710]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:42.550]  Kind of goes back to the sports thing again, you know?
[01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:45.630]  It's like some people might call us hoarders,
[01:19:45.630 --> 01:19:48.230]  but we're like, no, we're collectors.
[01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:50.590]  You know?
[01:19:51.670 --> 01:19:54.350]  Well, the good thing too is, you know,
[01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:56.590]  other things we discuss on the show is, you know,
[01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:58.310]  sometimes we show off the packs,
[01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:59.950]  but you'll also notice some of them are open.
[01:19:59.950 --> 01:20:01.830]  So we do plant these.
[01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:06.830]  I've actually got my upcoming pack of the next stuff to pop.
[01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:11.110]  I'm leaving the country again in November.
[01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:13.590]  So based off of the last time I did,
[01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:18.430]  I'm not planting anything I want to have alive before I go.
[01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:19.470]  I was gonna plant these,
[01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:21.110]  but then timing just didn't work out.
[01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:24.110]  So we're gonna do the Hong Kong Phuoi
[01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:26.030]  because this has the dog shit in it.
[01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:27.590]  The dog shit is something I remember
[01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:29.510]  from the Pacific Northwest in the 90s
[01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:32.870]  that I thought was an absolute joke of a name
[01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:35.350]  until like 20 years later when other people were like,
[01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:36.390]  yeah, the dog shit.
[01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:40.870]  So it's part of this in here.
[01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:43.070]  That I wanna hunt through.
[01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:45.390]  I'm looking for the foulness.
[01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:48.910]  And I kind of showed these a little bit real quickly
[01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:51.870]  on the last show from Katsu Seeds.
[01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:53.550]  We've got Shromba,
[01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:58.550]  which is a combination of not fucking focusing.
[01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:01.310]  And there we go.
[01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:02.150]  Oh, nice.
[01:21:02.150 --> 01:21:03.230]  Shrom.
[01:21:03.230 --> 01:21:04.070]  And P98.
[01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:06.910]  And Shrom is something that we used to get years ago
[01:21:06.910 --> 01:21:08.790]  here in the rec market.
[01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:10.510]  Loved it.
[01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:11.830]  Haven't seen it for years.
[01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:14.070]  And then the P98 Bubba is something
[01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:16.590]  that really helps my stomach.
[01:21:16.590 --> 01:21:18.990]  And again, shout out to James,
[01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:22.510]  who was on episode seven of Seed Collectors.
[01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.110]  Just through talking to him,
[01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:27.550]  he heard that the P98 Bubba and like the Burmese
[01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:29.950]  helps with my stomach.
[01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:31.950]  So he sent me out a couple of packs
[01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:34.750]  with the P98 Bubba in it.
[01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:37.150]  So this is another one he sent me.
[01:21:37.150 --> 01:21:39.030]  Key Lime Kush.
[01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:41.070]  Gonna pop some of these.
[01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:45.790]  Yeah, I'm really curious what the flavor will be.
[01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:47.790]  But yeah, Shrom, do you know more?
[01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:49.030]  Do you know more about Shrom
[01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:51.350]  other than just me and my wife really liked it?
[01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:54.110]  We used to kick it with the dude on the forums
[01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.950]  back in the day.
[01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:56.790]  And he hooked up the clone of it.
[01:21:56.790 --> 01:22:01.070]  It used to be Shroomy 420 on the forums and shit.
[01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:03.950]  Yeah, it's that weed would like get you all types
[01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:06.110]  of like jacked up and shit like that.
[01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:10.910]  And it smelled like a lime type of a 7up type.
[01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:13.470]  Yeah, it was really, really good weed, man.
[01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:15.790]  Yeah, it's been years.
[01:22:15.790 --> 01:22:18.070]  And we liked that one.
[01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:21.070]  So that's awesome.
[01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:24.190]  And excited too for the Key Lime Kush with the P98.
[01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:25.570]  I'm curious what that's gonna taste.
[01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:28.270]  If it's gonna be more of a like Bubba taste
[01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:31.410]  or like a sweet thing or have some of that lime.
[01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:35.990]  And then because I was like,
[01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:40.990]  well, I'm doing an auto pots system.
[01:22:41.010 --> 01:22:44.230]  So if I put them in there, I'm just gonna run Femmes,
[01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:47.670]  some Cali connection, some Chemdog 4.
[01:22:49.390 --> 01:22:54.350]  I'm gonna give that a shot and just see what I get.
[01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:55.930]  If it's what I'm looking for in the cam.
[01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:58.070]  I've got a whole bunch of cam that I'm searching through
[01:22:58.070 --> 01:23:00.570]  for the cam that I remember.
[01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:02.830]  I've got a jar of the pre 91 cam here
[01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:04.710]  that this is what I'm looking for.
[01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:10.830]  And then cheese.
[01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:13.430]  I've got other cheeses that I'm running through too.
[01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:15.510]  I gave up looking for skunk.
[01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:17.910]  If he texts me your phone number,
[01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:20.670]  I can hook you up with a couple of things.
[01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:22.870]  Dude, I already learned this phone number trick.
[01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:24.190]  Dude, you're a smart guy.
[01:23:24.190 --> 01:23:25.990]  I see what you're doing right now.
[01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:29.670]  Message me on the discord or something like that.
[01:23:29.670 --> 01:23:32.990]  Nah, I'll send you something then.
[01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:34.870]  No, I like to live dangerously, man.
[01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:36.190]  I'll give you my number.
[01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:37.470]  All right, sweet man.
[01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:39.310]  That's what I like to hear.
[01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:41.630]  Fortune favors the brave man.
[01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:44.670]  Yeah, like some hey do and some skunk man
[01:23:44.670 --> 01:23:47.310]  might help you out on that.
[01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:48.830]  That'd be awesome, man.
[01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:50.150]  Fucking wow.
[01:23:51.670 --> 01:23:53.570]  I'm speechless, Dave, save me.
[01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:56.750]  Well, here's some AK bean brains.
[01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:58.270]  We were talking about him.
[01:23:58.270 --> 01:24:00.670]  Oh yeah, fuck yeah.
[01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:02.070]  Which one is that there?
[01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:03.710]  William's wonder?
[01:24:03.710 --> 01:24:05.590]  Willie's wonder.
[01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:07.390]  Fuck yeah, dude.
[01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:08.230]  That's awesome.
[01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:09.310]  Willie's wonder.
[01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:10.270]  Yeah.
[01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:12.550]  I'm so excited for this winner.
[01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:13.390]  Oh yeah.
[01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:16.830]  And his story too was there was an older gentleman
[01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:18.470]  down in Willems, Oregon
[01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:20.710]  who is really kind of responsible for that.
[01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:23.430]  And that's cool because it's, you know,
[01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:24.750]  Oregon's right below me.
[01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:27.150]  And I take Pacific Northwest pride
[01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:28.270]  in a lot of these things.
[01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:30.910]  So it's cool to hear the backstory of that.
[01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:35.070]  And too, it's always Willems, Williams, Willems.
[01:24:36.230 --> 01:24:37.710]  Willamette.
[01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:39.230]  Yeah, Willamette Valley there.
[01:24:39.230 --> 01:24:40.350]  Right by Tillamook.
[01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:42.990]  You go get your cheese and you get some weed.
[01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:44.230]  Yep, exactly.
[01:24:44.230 --> 01:24:45.550]  Yeah, when I was out there.
[01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:47.070]  Yep, exactly, dude.
[01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:50.350]  Beatrix Joyce, man.
[01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:52.950]  Yeah, I was calling it Williamette
[01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:54.670]  when I moved out there and they're like,
[01:24:54.670 --> 01:24:55.870]  no, it's Willamette.
[01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:58.910]  So like I used to catch it in Pennsylvania
[01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:59.950]  saying Lancaster.
[01:24:59.950 --> 01:25:02.230]  Like, no, it's Lancaster.
[01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:05.590]  I was like, no, it's clearly spelled Lancaster,
[01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:06.950]  but whatever, man.
[01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:08.670]  Winning round, I'll say it.
[01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:12.030]  I mean, if we're gonna talk East Coast spelling
[01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:14.350]  and pronunciation, let's go with Greenwich.
[01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:15.950]  Greenwich or Greenwich?
[01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:17.630]  Come on, people.
[01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:18.830]  That's what I'm saying, man.
[01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:20.670]  It's definitely some Greenwich, bro.
[01:25:20.670 --> 01:25:24.710]  Yeah, we can tell who's from around here or not.
[01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:28.390]  We have a lot of like Skykomish and Snoqualmie
[01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:31.030]  and a lot of like words that don't naturally
[01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:32.270]  roll off your tongue.
[01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:35.990]  If you're not from here.
[01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:38.030]  Yeah, dude.
[01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:40.310]  Back in Richmond, they have the Powhite Parkway
[01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:41.270]  and shit too.
[01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:43.310]  And then they started pronouncing it Powhite
[01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:44.950]  all of a sudden on the radio one day.
[01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:46.430]  I was like, what?
[01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:47.790]  They got all PC about it.
[01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:50.750]  I was like, no, it's definitely the Powhite Parkway, dude.
[01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:52.630]  It's spelled like it and everything.
[01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:55.190]  Oh man, it's like this girl from junior high,
[01:25:55.190 --> 01:25:57.190]  from the summer of junior high to high school,
[01:25:57.190 --> 01:26:00.030]  her name went from Genevieve to John B. Ev.
[01:26:01.150 --> 01:26:03.270]  And that only lasted like a few weeks.
[01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:04.110]  So.
[01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:06.910]  It's like, no.
[01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:09.910]  John Claude Van, damn your name's confusing.
[01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:13.830]  Oh, you Jennifer.
[01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:15.710]  Oh man.
[01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:19.510]  He was a brilliant actor.
[01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:22.430]  Him and Steven Seagal, I swear, they need to be,
[01:26:22.430 --> 01:26:24.390]  they need to be respected.
[01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:25.750]  Yeah.
[01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:27.830]  What was Gypsy Nirvana?
[01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:29.510]  What movie was it that he was in?
[01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:31.070]  Was it Best of the Best?
[01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:33.550]  Oh God.
[01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:35.550]  And they made like four of those.
[01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:36.390]  Yeah.
[01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:38.270]  How do you make, it was like David Dukakis,
[01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:41.350]  I think was like the main guy in the Best of the Best ones.
[01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:42.190]  But.
[01:26:42.190 --> 01:26:43.030]  Yeah.
[01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:44.990]  Did like the Breeder Gypsy Nirvana?
[01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.830]  Yeah.
[01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:46.870]  Was in a movie?
[01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:47.710]  Yeah, no shit.
[01:26:47.710 --> 01:26:49.350]  One of the Best of the Best movies.
[01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:50.710]  I forgot which one.
[01:26:50.710 --> 01:26:52.310]  Yeah, no shit, dude.
[01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:54.230]  That's fucking crazy.
[01:26:54.230 --> 01:26:55.630]  It might've been the worst.
[01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:59.030]  Well, that's what I always wonder is like, dude,
[01:26:59.030 --> 01:27:01.070]  how can you have a Best of the Best four?
[01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:03.390]  And I think they actually went to maybe like five or six,
[01:27:04.230 --> 01:27:05.510]  but like, shouldn't have you wrap this up
[01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:09.150]  in the first movie, like Best of the Best?
[01:27:09.150 --> 01:27:11.790]  But how do you keep selling that shit?
[01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:13.990]  Yeah, I guess every year they got to figure out
[01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:17.310]  who's the best that year or something.
[01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:18.150]  I don't know.
[01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:20.950]  It's been a long time since I watched them.
[01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:23.190]  It's the Kumite from Bloodsport.
[01:27:23.190 --> 01:27:26.830]  Yeah, Bloodsport, Kickboxer and shit.
[01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:29.790]  Fighting with the fucking, the glass on the fucking head.
[01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:30.630]  Yes.
[01:27:31.630 --> 01:27:33.110]  Hot Shots Part 2.
[01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:34.670]  Do you remember that movie?
[01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:36.110]  Where they're like doing the scene
[01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:38.550]  where he's dipping them in like gummy bears?
[01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:39.390]  Oh yeah.
[01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:43.510]  It's like he's at a fucking ice cream joint or something.
[01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:47.110]  Say, fucking Hot Shots.
[01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:51.990]  Long live Charlie Sheen, fucking Tiger's Blood.
[01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.990]  Yeah.
[01:27:52.990 --> 01:27:55.550]  You know, he was doing cameos for a while
[01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:57.430]  and then like he put on there, he's like,
[01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:59.950]  no more winning, no more Tiger's Blood.
[01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:02.390]  Come up with something new and then like he canceled it
[01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:04.590]  so he doesn't do it anymore.
[01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:05.550]  Right.
[01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:06.830]  He's like, God damn it.
[01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:09.750]  Yeah, that was, you know, it's like,
[01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:13.470]  I really hate to see people in that like mental state,
[01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:15.910]  but that was one of the funnest fucking mental breakdowns
[01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:16.870]  I have ever witnessed.
[01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:19.230]  It's like a toss up between him and Britney Spears.
[01:28:19.230 --> 01:28:20.790]  Like those were both pretty fucking,
[01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:22.430]  those were pretty good mental breakdowns.
[01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:24.030]  Yeah, those were pretty gnarly, man.
[01:28:24.030 --> 01:28:25.710]  I'm gonna give it to Charlie though,
[01:28:25.710 --> 01:28:29.590]  cause like, dude, all the porn stars and the hookers
[01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:32.430]  and all the drugs and like, he was going for it, you know?
[01:28:32.430 --> 01:28:34.950]  He was really, really going for it.
[01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:37.990]  And like for that, like kudos, you know?
[01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:39.710]  That was a stretched bender.
[01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:41.550]  Like that was professional grade.
[01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:42.790]  That was professional grade.
[01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:45.470]  Like that's what you aspire to if that's your thing.
[01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:48.550]  Yeah, most people would have died like in week or shit,
[01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:50.710]  day one, let alone week one.
[01:28:50.710 --> 01:28:52.390]  Yeah, he stretched it out.
[01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:54.350]  I'm banging eight gram rocks, that's how I roll.
[01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:57.470]  That's, you know, that's what I do.
[01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:58.430]  Yeah.
[01:28:59.590 --> 01:29:02.950]  I forgot some of the shit that he fucking said.
[01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:05.910]  Why did he have a shrimp fork in her purse anyways?
[01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:07.390]  It's like what?
[01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:09.990]  But I got Adonis DNA, Sacrebleu.
[01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:14.270]  You got booger DNA, poo poo blood.
[01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:18.470]  He was such a, he was quick on his feet, man.
[01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:19.990]  That was a fun one.
[01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:23.910]  Hate to root for it, but hey, sometimes schadenfreude,
[01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:25.150]  schadenfreude, whatever.
[01:29:26.110 --> 01:29:27.870]  Yeah, it's something German.
[01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:29.070]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:34.750]  Let me put these seeds back in.
[01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:36.830]  Dave, do you have anything that you know
[01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:38.110]  that you're gonna pop next
[01:29:38.110 --> 01:29:40.750]  or that you think you're gonna pop next?
[01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:42.950]  Well, are you still working through clones?
[01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:44.030]  I'm still working through clones,
[01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:46.430]  but I know what I'm popping next.
[01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:48.630]  Let me grab now.
[01:29:48.630 --> 01:29:50.110]  Which you got.
[01:29:50.110 --> 01:29:53.590]  And I guess we could go the same thing to you, Duke,
[01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:57.550]  if you know anything that you're gonna be throwing in next.
[01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:59.590]  Yeah, technically the next things
[01:29:59.590 --> 01:30:02.550]  that I'm gonna germinate will be,
[01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:03.990]  they're gonna be like testers,
[01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:06.910]  like test seeds from stuff that was just making.
[01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:11.070]  So, but aside from that, like things that I'm further
[01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:16.070]  growing is those Cali Mist F3s, the Slice, the NO5 Haze,
[01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:20.470]  the Williams Wonder, the Beatrix Choice.
[01:30:21.230 --> 01:30:22.070]  Yeah.
[01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:26.950]  And there's gonna be like a couple of mine
[01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:30.550]  that I'm revisiting for my own selfish reasons.
[01:30:32.150 --> 01:30:33.190]  That's fair enough.
[01:30:33.190 --> 01:30:37.150]  And yeah, I actually need to open my flower tent right now.
[01:30:37.150 --> 01:30:38.430]  I'm looking at the time, but yeah,
[01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:43.430]  I've got 10 of my Nakatomi Plaza right now
[01:30:45.230 --> 01:30:46.390]  going in the other tent.
[01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:49.110]  There's just, you know, again, things I made,
[01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:52.470]  they've been getting tested by people all summer,
[01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:54.790]  which is nice because a lot of people ran them outside
[01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:59.390]  and I don't run outside, but just the final 10 testers.
[01:30:59.390 --> 01:31:01.510]  And then I'll be like, okay, we're cool.
[01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:05.510]  Cause I don't wanna be that guy, man.
[01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:06.830]  I really don't.
[01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:08.510]  I wanna be doing this for a long time.
[01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:11.310]  So just be cool.
[01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:12.150]  Yeah, man.
[01:31:12.150 --> 01:31:12.990]  That's the thing.
[01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:15.310]  You only got one name, man.
[01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:16.150]  Yeah.
[01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:18.710]  Keep it nice, you know.
[01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:22.390]  But I did make some cool stickers.
[01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:23.310]  Oh yeah.
[01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:25.470]  Oh, not me.
[01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:26.310]  Let's see there.
[01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:27.550]  Blow myself up there.
[01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:29.750]  But yeah, the Nakatomi Plaza.
[01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:31.550]  See if it focuses.
[01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:32.390]  There we go.
[01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:33.950]  You gotta be like really careful, man,
[01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:38.510]  because like Hollywood and like other, you know,
[01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:40.190]  shit like they're hip to us,
[01:31:40.190 --> 01:31:42.910]  us stoners like playing off of their shit
[01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:44.070]  and like suing us now.
[01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:46.590]  So yeah, be real careful.
[01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:48.430]  This is true.
[01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:50.550]  Definitely don't go with the Star Wars name.
[01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:54.310]  And I am, you know, I am so like,
[01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:56.590]  I'm so underground that the worms are like,
[01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:58.190]  this dude is underground.
[01:31:58.190 --> 01:32:02.510]  But yeah, at some point, I mean,
[01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:06.030]  Burner's level is a particularly good one.
[01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:10.830]  You're gonna get sued for using Girl Scout cookies, bro.
[01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:14.990]  But I, you know, kind of to your point too,
[01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:17.830]  or maybe just a hidden message in there is,
[01:32:18.710 --> 01:32:22.590]  if you build a brand or if you build a reputation
[01:32:22.590 --> 01:32:25.950]  on something like that, that you've ripped off
[01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:30.270]  at the height of your, you know, career or whatever,
[01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:31.630]  when it really matters the most,
[01:32:31.630 --> 01:32:33.630]  you're gonna have it all taken away from you.
[01:32:33.630 --> 01:32:37.190]  So don't start down that road
[01:32:37.190 --> 01:32:40.070]  if you're gonna build something big off of it.
[01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:41.830]  So thank you for mentioning that.
[01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:44.070]  Yeah, it's like the Gorilla Glue thing, you know,
[01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:46.390]  it started off as like a clan, you know,
[01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:49.870]  amongst some friends and then it starts spreading out there
[01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:52.030]  and getting big and then, you know,
[01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:54.630]  a brand came up around it before you know it,
[01:32:54.630 --> 01:32:57.150]  like, you know, the glue people are on them,
[01:32:57.150 --> 01:32:59.230]  like stink on shit, man.
[01:32:59.230 --> 01:33:01.830]  Fucking Hitman Dougie was fucking getting sued
[01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:04.110]  over the fucking little Starbucks fucking little
[01:33:04.110 --> 01:33:05.710]  dab rigs and shit.
[01:33:05.710 --> 01:33:06.790]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:10.990]  Yeah, I understand it because if you went to, you know,
[01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:13.390]  Google and typed in Gorilla Glue,
[01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:17.110]  looking for this product that's been around for 20, 30 years
[01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:18.390]  you're getting weed.
[01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:22.790]  So that's the point of intellectual property
[01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:24.150]  and all that theft stuff.
[01:33:24.150 --> 01:33:26.350]  So yeah, be careful, man.
[01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:29.430]  HR department is not pleased, you know,
[01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:33.470]  fucking like, oh fuck, getting the cease and desist shit,
[01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:35.550]  you know, but I guess the thing, man,
[01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:38.230]  you just gotta put a Z on everything,
[01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:39.230]  you'll be cool, man.
[01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:42.430]  Just slightly misspell it, you know,
[01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:47.430]  like it's Nakatami, yeah, Nakatami, exactly.
[01:33:47.630 --> 01:33:49.790]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:51.110]  That's it, man.
[01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.950]  Nakatami.
[01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:54.390]  Oh shit, all right.
[01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:56.870]  I'm gonna open a tent real quick, Dave.
[01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:57.710]  No worries.
[01:33:57.710 --> 01:33:59.910]  I'll let you two entertain.
[01:33:59.910 --> 01:34:02.550]  Well, you had asked me what I was planning on popping next,
[01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:03.390]  so.
[01:34:03.390 --> 01:34:04.230]  Yeah.
[01:34:05.190 --> 01:34:06.230]  I'll blow you up, dude.
[01:34:06.230 --> 01:34:07.070]  Yeah, I'll blow you up.
[01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:09.310]  Yeah, I'll blow you up, dude.
[01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:10.150]  Yeah.
[01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:14.350]  Bull Vintage Afghani from Bob Hemphill's
[01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:16.030]  Little Seed Increase.
[01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:20.070]  Ooh, nice.
[01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:22.030]  It's a good sound, I love that.
[01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:25.950]  And you got the Jaro F5s from Mean Gene.
[01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:29.350]  That should be some good winners.
[01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:30.630]  Although Dog Days is telling me,
[01:34:30.630 --> 01:34:33.710]  I'm making a mistake that this is what I should pop next,
[01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:35.550]  the Granny Skunk.
[01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:37.190]  Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:34:37.190 --> 01:34:38.150]  That's a good one.
[01:34:39.630 --> 01:34:42.630]  So, I mean, there's always options,
[01:34:42.630 --> 01:34:44.990]  but these are what I have my heart set on the most,
[01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:46.150]  because I've currently,
[01:34:46.150 --> 01:34:48.190]  I've made my own little selections
[01:34:48.190 --> 01:34:53.150]  using the Katsu Bubba Jaro and some other things.
[01:34:53.150 --> 01:34:55.430]  I think that would be a great combination
[01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:57.510]  with this Vintage Afghani.
[01:34:57.510 --> 01:35:00.230]  And then working the actual Jaro into the line too.
[01:35:01.110 --> 01:35:02.070]  Yeah.
[01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.910]  That would be cool.
[01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:07.470]  How many of the Afghanis are you gonna pop and work through?
[01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:09.750]  Are you gonna do all but two?
[01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:11.910]  Or are you gonna slowly work through that?
[01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:14.470]  I would like to actually work them
[01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:17.510]  and reproduce more seeds.
[01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:19.510]  So I would like to pop them all
[01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:21.630]  and then open pollinate them.
[01:35:21.630 --> 01:35:22.470]  Awesome.
[01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:25.190]  And with a pack like that,
[01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:26.710]  I think you were talking last time too,
[01:35:26.710 --> 01:35:30.430]  that that one's got a good vintage on it.
[01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:31.430]  It's got some years.
[01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:33.750]  So that would be nice to, yeah,
[01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:36.830]  do a seed increase, open pollinate.
[01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:38.030]  Definitely.
[01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.870]  Definitely.
[01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:43.230]  And then you can really find some stuff
[01:35:43.230 --> 01:35:44.790]  in them F2s as well.
[01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.830]  Yeah.
[01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:52.870]  Now, have you seen, either of you guys,
[01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:56.750]  seen a lot of pink pistils on maybe some indoor plants?
[01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:58.790]  So I kind of was on the impression
[01:35:58.830 --> 01:36:02.070]  it might come from like an Afghani lineage,
[01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:07.030]  but I know like Mr. Toad's work, the Boneyard Seeds,
[01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:08.830]  he has a space cheese.
[01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:12.350]  And a lot of his crosses with that space cheese in it,
[01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:14.710]  people are like, oh, I'm getting some pink pistils.
[01:36:14.710 --> 01:36:16.390]  And that seems to be the common factor.
[01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:20.270]  So this was the first time I've actually had it myself.
[01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:22.030]  I always thought it was like an outdoor thing.
[01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:25.870]  It needs extra like UV from the sun, but this was indoors.
[01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:27.750]  So I don't know.
[01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:29.150]  Have you guys ever run into that
[01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:31.790]  with any strains that you've grown?
[01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:33.630]  Yes.
[01:36:33.630 --> 01:36:34.470]  Not me.
[01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:35.830]  Not that kind of shit.
[01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:36.750]  Okay.
[01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:39.910]  So I pop up quite a bit with some of that stuff.
[01:36:41.630 --> 01:36:42.750]  Yep.
[01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:43.950]  That was just as interesting.
[01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:48.070]  I know there's like the Friesland from,
[01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:52.110]  I think it was Sensi Seeds or Friesian.
[01:36:52.110 --> 01:36:55.030]  Friesian, the Friesian duck, I think was Toad's,
[01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:56.850]  but those were pink pistol ones,
[01:36:56.850 --> 01:36:58.850]  but they were outdoor strains.
[01:36:58.850 --> 01:36:59.970]  So I'm just like, yeah, okay.
[01:36:59.970 --> 01:37:01.970]  That's where the magic is.
[01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:02.930]  Yeah.
[01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:03.770]  But yeah.
[01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:04.610]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:06.130]  You definitely seen it outdoor for sure.
[01:37:06.130 --> 01:37:06.970]  Yeah.
[01:37:06.970 --> 01:37:09.530]  Yeah, you see, it's definitely more common for sure.
[01:37:10.730 --> 01:37:11.570]  Yeah.
[01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:16.570]  But that was one of the strains I lost
[01:37:16.770 --> 01:37:18.050]  when I went to Amsterdam
[01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:20.290]  and had somebody watch in the garden.
[01:37:20.290 --> 01:37:22.490]  So unfortunately there's-
[01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:25.610]  Is that where you're going back to, bud?
[01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:26.450]  You're going back to-
[01:37:27.370 --> 01:37:28.970]  I'm gonna go to Mexico.
[01:37:30.490 --> 01:37:31.890]  First time to Mexico,
[01:37:31.890 --> 01:37:36.610]  but I'm gonna go down to Yucatan Peninsula and hang out.
[01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:39.050]  So that'll be fun.
[01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:40.810]  I got some people down there, man.
[01:37:40.810 --> 01:37:44.290]  Fucking, you have to hang out with them.
[01:37:44.290 --> 01:37:45.130]  Yeah.
[01:37:45.130 --> 01:37:46.030]  Well, I'm already giving you my number.
[01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:48.410]  So, you know, we're gonna have to, you know,
[01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:51.810]  in between dick pics might actually have to send me some.
[01:37:51.810 --> 01:37:52.650]  Yeah.
[01:37:52.650 --> 01:37:55.010]  I totally got you, dude.
[01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:56.250]  I totally got you, man.
[01:37:57.250 --> 01:37:58.090]  Easy.
[01:37:58.090 --> 01:37:58.910]  That's fucking rad.
[01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:59.750]  Easy breezy.
[01:37:59.750 --> 01:38:00.590]  Yeah.
[01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:01.490]  Well, that'll be fun.
[01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:02.330]  I'm looking forward to it.
[01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:05.450]  You know, I was never a big drinker.
[01:38:05.450 --> 01:38:06.770]  I'm allergic to alcohol.
[01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:09.450]  Figured this one out at a young age, but so like-
[01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:11.270]  Do you break out in handcuffs?
[01:38:12.130 --> 01:38:17.130]  Do you wanna lose guys, Chad?
[01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:21.610]  Actually, I have.
[01:38:21.610 --> 01:38:24.210]  Black out and start fucking shit up.
[01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:27.090]  No, I'm a cheap date.
[01:38:27.090 --> 01:38:28.530]  We'll put it that way.
[01:38:28.530 --> 01:38:29.370]  Fucking even better, man.
[01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:30.330]  I'm a cheap date.
[01:38:30.330 --> 01:38:32.050]  I can't handle my shit.
[01:38:32.050 --> 01:38:34.490]  So I don't drink.
[01:38:34.490 --> 01:38:37.890]  So when, you know, 19, like senior trip, I never,
[01:38:37.890 --> 01:38:40.370]  I'd fucking, I wasn't really normal senior.
[01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:41.190]  I was living on my own.
[01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:44.410]  But anyways, a lot of kids go to Mexico to drink
[01:38:44.410 --> 01:38:45.250]  when they're young.
[01:38:45.250 --> 01:38:46.890]  And that was just never my thing.
[01:38:46.890 --> 01:38:49.090]  So I've never been to Mexico.
[01:38:49.090 --> 01:38:50.690]  By the time I was 21,
[01:38:50.690 --> 01:38:53.170]  I had already decided to quit drinking.
[01:38:53.170 --> 01:38:54.010]  Like, yeah.
[01:38:54.850 --> 01:38:58.050]  And then drank a little bit after,
[01:38:58.050 --> 01:39:00.370]  like when I was on probation the first time.
[01:39:00.370 --> 01:39:04.690]  And I'm right back at it till January.
[01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:06.530]  Yep.
[01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:07.530]  It's a good choice you got there.
[01:39:07.530 --> 01:39:08.850]  Dale's is good shit.
[01:39:08.850 --> 01:39:09.670]  Yeah, man.
[01:39:09.670 --> 01:39:11.550]  Pork chop in every fucking can.
[01:39:12.490 --> 01:39:13.330]  Geez.
[01:39:13.330 --> 01:39:18.330]  Is that, where does that rank on the, like the Schmidt scale?
[01:39:18.490 --> 01:39:21.810]  Is that above or below Schmidt's?
[01:39:21.810 --> 01:39:22.650]  Well above.
[01:39:22.650 --> 01:39:24.450]  I don't know what Schmidt's is.
[01:39:24.450 --> 01:39:27.530]  Schmidt's is one of those beers that,
[01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:29.650]  you know what hunting season it is?
[01:39:29.650 --> 01:39:31.970]  Because that animal is on the can.
[01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:32.810]  Yes.
[01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:34.850]  So.
[01:39:34.850 --> 01:39:37.810]  Schmidt's, Schaefer, Rheingold,
[01:39:37.810 --> 01:39:41.770]  all these old school, old timer beers that are just gross.
[01:39:41.770 --> 01:39:42.610]  Yes.
[01:39:42.610 --> 01:39:44.130]  Fuck yeah, dude.
[01:39:44.130 --> 01:39:47.130]  Yeah, as low as I'll go anymore nowadays,
[01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:50.730]  it'd be like, I don't know, man.
[01:39:50.730 --> 01:39:53.090]  Like a rolling rock or something like that.
[01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:54.730]  The angling, you know.
[01:39:54.730 --> 01:39:58.130]  They used to be like Mickey's Big Mouth, Steel Reserve.
[01:39:58.130 --> 01:39:58.970]  Yeah.
[01:39:58.970 --> 01:39:59.810]  Fucking hammered.
[01:39:59.810 --> 01:40:01.010]  Steel Reserve.
[01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:02.850]  Oh, dude.
[01:40:02.850 --> 01:40:04.850]  High gravity lager.
[01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:07.090]  That's lager, baby.
[01:40:07.090 --> 01:40:09.330]  Yeah, straight up, man.
[01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:10.170]  Yeah.
[01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:11.570]  It's 8%.
[01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:13.890]  8.8, dude.
[01:40:13.890 --> 01:40:15.810]  Yeah, you just hold your nose the whole time drinking it,
[01:40:15.810 --> 01:40:18.210]  but it's 8.1%.
[01:40:18.250 --> 01:40:21.370]  Dude, you would chug down a fence post to that shit, man.
[01:40:21.370 --> 01:40:23.730]  Your fucking face would go numb for a second.
[01:40:23.730 --> 01:40:25.330]  You're like, yeah.
[01:40:25.330 --> 01:40:26.570]  You know?
[01:40:26.570 --> 01:40:27.930]  Fuck, man.
[01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:30.330]  Oh man, I'm seeing some awesome old beer names.
[01:40:30.330 --> 01:40:34.570]  Slits, Stag, some awesome names in chat.
[01:40:35.610 --> 01:40:39.250]  Yeah, I was a big fan of the Killian's Irish Red too.
[01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:41.570]  Always liked that one.
[01:40:42.890 --> 01:40:45.290]  I remember hearing that.
[01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:46.850]  The Red Stripe was all right.
[01:40:47.010 --> 01:40:48.170]  It's different up here,
[01:40:48.170 --> 01:40:50.610]  because I used to take a cigarette lighter
[01:40:50.610 --> 01:40:54.250]  and pop the top, and that fucker would launch off.
[01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:56.130]  They don't do it here in Colorado.
[01:40:56.130 --> 01:40:58.130]  I guess it's the altitude or something.
[01:40:58.130 --> 01:41:00.130]  I don't know.
[01:41:00.130 --> 01:41:02.570]  I was looking forward to popping that motherfucker,
[01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:05.130]  but it didn't pop off like talking about.
[01:41:05.130 --> 01:41:07.490]  It's a boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:08.370]  Yeah, it literally did.
[01:41:08.370 --> 01:41:09.370]  It flipped off.
[01:41:09.370 --> 01:41:11.610]  I'm like, oh man, is this shit stale?
[01:41:11.610 --> 01:41:12.810]  I even had to smell it.
[01:41:12.810 --> 01:41:14.650]  There's really something wrong with this.
[01:41:14.650 --> 01:41:16.410]  But beer was good.
[01:41:16.930 --> 01:41:17.770]  It was okay.
[01:41:17.770 --> 01:41:20.370]  Colorado, you can't pop off your beer tops
[01:41:20.370 --> 01:41:22.770]  and you can't keep your weed wet.
[01:41:22.770 --> 01:41:24.290]  Problems.
[01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:25.970]  Yeah, man. Altitude.
[01:41:25.970 --> 01:41:28.130]  Yeah, I'd be like that, man.
[01:41:28.130 --> 01:41:30.650]  Just gotta work around the system,
[01:41:30.650 --> 01:41:32.410]  find those little life hacks, you know.
[01:41:32.410 --> 01:41:35.570]  But the Dale's Pale Ale, it does all right.
[01:41:37.650 --> 01:41:39.810]  It can still be shot good.
[01:41:39.810 --> 01:41:41.450]  Oh yeah, yeah, for sure.
[01:41:41.450 --> 01:41:42.530]  For sure, man.
[01:41:42.530 --> 01:41:45.290]  Yeah, just fucking go for it.
[01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:47.290]  I haven't done that in so long, man.
[01:41:48.330 --> 01:41:49.810]  Yeah, I would be afraid.
[01:41:50.810 --> 01:41:52.210]  I wouldn't ask you to do it.
[01:41:53.330 --> 01:41:57.010]  Yeah, I would only do that in person at a show or something.
[01:41:57.010 --> 01:41:58.690]  You know what I mean?
[01:41:58.690 --> 01:42:00.650]  You bring a sixer or something good
[01:42:00.650 --> 01:42:04.210]  and we'll sit down and drink that fucking thing, you know?
[01:42:04.210 --> 01:42:06.530]  It's like really hard skate tricks.
[01:42:06.530 --> 01:42:09.250]  I'll only do them now if there's a camera.
[01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:11.210]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:42:11.210 --> 01:42:13.770]  It's gotta be worth the pain later.
[01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:17.610]  Is there a camera or money at the bottom of the stairs?
[01:42:17.610 --> 01:42:19.970]  Let me know, I'm your man.
[01:42:19.970 --> 01:42:21.330]  Fuck yeah, man.
[01:42:21.330 --> 01:42:24.410]  Fuck yeah, do you still wear Vans?
[01:42:24.410 --> 01:42:29.410]  Yeah, still wear Vans, rock Vans, love Vans.
[01:42:29.410 --> 01:42:30.250]  Yeah.
[01:42:30.250 --> 01:42:31.650]  Got my Vans.
[01:42:31.650 --> 01:42:35.530]  You have to put those, the Ultra range, those shoes.
[01:42:36.410 --> 01:42:37.250]  No.
[01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:39.450]  The Ultra, Ultra comfy cush,
[01:42:39.450 --> 01:42:42.010]  like they're like so squishy and shit.
[01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:44.850]  Oh, that's what they always say.
[01:42:44.850 --> 01:42:48.770]  Nah, like I've had the same pair for like some years now.
[01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:49.730]  Right?
[01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:54.130]  They're like the grow room, grower preferred fucking shoes.
[01:42:54.130 --> 01:42:55.450]  Dude, I wear them everywhere,
[01:42:55.450 --> 01:42:57.930]  but dude, they're just so good, man.
[01:42:57.930 --> 01:43:01.490]  And like you get a lot of traction to the floor too,
[01:43:01.490 --> 01:43:02.850]  like in case you spill something,
[01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:04.730]  they're not all slick and everything,
[01:43:04.730 --> 01:43:06.210]  but they don't weigh nothing, man.
[01:43:06.210 --> 01:43:09.170]  Like they're light as a feather, they breathe super good.
[01:43:09.170 --> 01:43:10.530]  And like, they just,
[01:43:10.570 --> 01:43:13.810]  like you feel like you're walking on springs on this, man.
[01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:15.130]  Yeah, they're super, super good.
[01:43:15.130 --> 01:43:16.890]  Sounds like they tie themselves too,
[01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:18.930]  and like maybe like put money in your wallet.
[01:43:18.930 --> 01:43:19.810]  Damn, man.
[01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:20.930]  They do, they do.
[01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:22.010]  They definitely do.
[01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:23.690]  Cause like I tie them up once,
[01:43:23.690 --> 01:43:26.290]  skater lace style, and I just slip them on my feet.
[01:43:26.290 --> 01:43:27.530]  Yes.
[01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:29.330]  You tie them once, you cut the end,
[01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:31.250]  you burn it and call it good.
[01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:32.090]  Yeah, man.
[01:43:32.090 --> 01:43:34.930]  And like I get point A to point B and I'm making cheddar.
[01:43:34.930 --> 01:43:38.690]  So yeah, it checks all the boxes, man.
[01:43:38.730 --> 01:43:39.570]  Oh yeah, man.
[01:43:39.570 --> 01:43:41.770]  You do need a good concrete shoe though,
[01:43:41.770 --> 01:43:44.770]  for like working in those environments, man.
[01:43:44.770 --> 01:43:46.370]  Doc Martens helped me a lot,
[01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:48.690]  cause they have that, you know, really cush and sole,
[01:43:48.690 --> 01:43:52.490]  but I'll have to step up my bands game.
[01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:54.090]  I've just been getting the high tops.
[01:43:54.090 --> 01:43:54.930]  So.
[01:43:54.930 --> 01:43:56.770]  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with those,
[01:43:56.770 --> 01:43:57.610]  you know what I mean?
[01:43:57.610 --> 01:44:02.050]  But yeah, ultra range, ultra comfy cush and sole.
[01:44:02.050 --> 01:44:05.690]  Like dude, they're all right, man.
[01:44:05.690 --> 01:44:07.090]  They're real good.
[01:44:07.090 --> 01:44:08.530]  I highly recommend it.
[01:44:09.450 --> 01:44:11.090]  I have to give them a shot myself.
[01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:11.930]  Yeah, dude.
[01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:13.690]  Yeah, I was like really into,
[01:44:14.930 --> 01:44:19.250]  into like the right shoes for doing what I do and whatnot.
[01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:21.450]  I was real particular on the boots for, you know,
[01:44:21.450 --> 01:44:22.650]  doing industrial work.
[01:44:22.650 --> 01:44:27.010]  So like shout out to Oregon again, fucking Danner, dude.
[01:44:27.010 --> 01:44:29.810]  Danner boots, like those things are serious, man.
[01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:31.450]  Like those are good.
[01:44:31.450 --> 01:44:32.730]  Really comfortable.
[01:44:32.730 --> 01:44:35.130]  They're better than Red Wings, man.
[01:44:35.130 --> 01:44:35.970]  So.
[01:44:35.970 --> 01:44:36.810]  Okay, wow.
[01:44:37.290 --> 01:44:38.850]  That's saying something.
[01:44:38.850 --> 01:44:40.490]  Yeah, yeah, it really, really is.
[01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:43.850]  Red Wings pretty, pretty baller, but those Danners, man,
[01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:47.250]  they were, yeah, they were real nice, man.
[01:44:47.250 --> 01:44:48.370]  Definitely.
[01:44:48.370 --> 01:44:52.050]  I have to say my condolences to Texas Weedhopper in chat.
[01:44:52.050 --> 01:44:55.410]  Apparently his old lady just ordered him some more Crocs.
[01:44:57.250 --> 01:44:58.090]  Ordered him rocks?
[01:44:58.090 --> 01:44:59.170]  Oh no.
[01:44:59.170 --> 01:45:00.090]  Crocs.
[01:45:00.090 --> 01:45:00.930]  Crocs.
[01:45:00.930 --> 01:45:01.770]  Oh, Crocs.
[01:45:01.770 --> 01:45:02.610]  Crocs sandals.
[01:45:03.890 --> 01:45:05.850]  You know, they're outlawed.
[01:45:05.850 --> 01:45:08.290]  They're outlawed in a Slow Jama stand.
[01:45:11.700 --> 01:45:13.180]  They really are.
[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:15.340]  There's the place called Slow Jama stand
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:17.740]  on the Southern California border.
[01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:18.580]  Oh, wow.
[01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:19.420]  In the desert.
[01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:21.460]  Yeah, and they're outlawed there.
[01:45:21.460 --> 01:45:22.380]  No Crocs.
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:24.420]  Man, that's harsh.
[01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:27.220]  I thought you were like talking about some like place
[01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:29.620]  in like the Middle East that only plays
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:31.060]  like 80s love ballads.
[01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:36.020]  So I don't remember Slow Jama stand's like anthem,
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:39.620]  like it's something, it might be Bon Jovi.
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:42.860]  It's gotta be a power ballad from the 80s.
[01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:47.340]  Yeah, like maybe somebody in the chat can look it up.
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:48.620]  But like, it ain't no shit, man.
[01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:49.460]  It's real.
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:50.820]  It's Slow Jama stand.
[01:45:55.060 --> 01:45:56.820]  They got a dictator and everything.
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:02.380]  Makes me think they're just South of San Diego.
[01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:05.860]  It's like, okay guys, too many bros, too many Crocs.
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:07.660]  Can't have you down here.
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:08.660]  Sorry.
[01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:10.360]  No more old dick soup.
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:14.660]  Oh shit.
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:17.620]  Well, shifting a little bit.
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:20.220]  I don't know if you guys have ever grown anything
[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:23.020]  like hemp wise or CBD related,
[01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:26.100]  but one of the other things that I had come in
[01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:28.060]  since the last show,
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:30.620]  shout out to Hillbilly Herb Grower,
[01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:33.740]  but he hooked up some cherry wine CBD for me.
[01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:37.140]  I wanted to have some CBD to play around with.
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:40.900]  Cherry wine is a pretty known strain.
[01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:44.640]  And 50 to one, man, that's a pretty good ratio.
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.260]  Now the downside is being here in Washington.
[01:46:48.260 --> 01:46:52.300]  And unless you have a license,
[01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:55.460]  labs won't test anything for you, which sucks.
[01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:57.860]  Cause I have some Harlequin crosses that I've worked with
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:00.140]  that I'd love to really try to find some CBD
[01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:01.300]  and isolate CBD.
[01:47:01.300 --> 01:47:04.280]  I know the ratio that my body likes,
[01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:08.980]  but this will hopefully help me get there as well.
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:11.660]  So I'm excited about that, but I don't know.
[01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:13.260]  Have you guys grown hemp?
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:17.260]  Yeah, man, make sure to hit them with the humic acid
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:21.780]  and shit like if you're doing CBD and CBG.
[01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:24.420]  My bro, he turned me on to this cool study
[01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:25.960]  from Israel and stuff.
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:28.580]  And it was showing when you supplement that,
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:31.700]  it's gonna spike up CBG like substantially.
[01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:34.220]  And then the CBD would go up as well.
[01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:35.060]  So.
[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:38.820]  And I saw Dr. Robert Baus, he's from the,
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:43.660]  oh gosh, BioAg.
[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:46.260]  I'm like, we carry the stuff on dog.
[01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:49.620]  But he's, I mean, old guy, well-researched,
[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:50.620]  does a lot of these studies,
[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:53.820]  but he had found too that like higher levels of humic,
[01:47:53.820 --> 01:47:57.180]  late and flower depress the THC levels.
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:58.100]  THC, correct.
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:02.900]  THC goes down, CBD, CBG goes up.
[01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:04.260]  Yeah, that's awesome.
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:05.100]  That's good to know.
[01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:05.920]  Thank you for that.
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:07.180]  Cause I had forgot about that
[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:08.900]  in relation to something like this.
[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:12.060]  So I've written that down now.
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:14.580]  Get those little edges.
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:16.860]  It's all about the little things
[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:18.260]  adding up toward the end.
[01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:21.340]  Go from good to great.
[01:48:21.340 --> 01:48:25.020]  Yeah, just like the little stressors
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:26.180]  that people will put on.
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:30.100]  It's like, you joke, you spend so much time
[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:33.100]  trying to learn how to do everything perfectly.
[01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:35.500]  And in the end you realize that
[01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:38.540]  it's those imperfections, controlled,
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:40.580]  but imperfections that kind of make
[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:42.900]  a little bit of magic for you.
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:45.460]  Yeah, like after like senescence and all that,
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:46.620]  and like the end of the cycle,
[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:48.540]  and this plant's just kind of looking
[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:50.580]  a little haggard, like hammered dog shit.
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:52.860]  Like, dude, those are the best.
[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:56.100]  Cannabinoids are way up, terpenes are way up and stuff.
[01:48:57.020 --> 01:48:59.220]  Versus like a plant that's all picture perfect
[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:01.780]  and still green and everything.
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:04.660]  So yeah, there's definitely something to it.
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:06.860]  That was what that whole study was about.
[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:10.020]  Cause yeah, like before you say that
[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:11.060]  and like the new kids be like,
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:13.700]  yeah, it's brosa, it's like shut the fuck up.
[01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:15.100]  Like it's fucking proof.
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:17.220]  Like yeah, I feel like you do one thing,
[01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:20.140]  and you got one plant finishing out like that,
[01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:20.980]  it's the same thing.
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:25.180]  And then the other ones finish right in my opinion.
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:26.500]  And one's better than the other.
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:29.940]  Like, yeah, there's some science to that.
[01:49:29.940 --> 01:49:32.860]  But anyway, this Israeli government
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:38.780]  put on a very controlled experiment,
[01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:40.420]  went through all that.
[01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:44.180]  So that was good to like finally see it like on paper,
[01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:48.060]  scientists with lab coats and black leather gloves
[01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:49.020]  and all that shit.
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:51.340]  They did it.
[01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:54.820]  Way better than the blue latex gloves.
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:58.300]  The black gloves, that's a good guy.
[01:49:59.420 --> 01:50:04.420]  But Israel is, they are probably the leaders
[01:50:04.540 --> 01:50:09.140]  as far as human studies as well.
[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:12.660]  Clinical trials with cannabis like Israel,
[01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:14.660]  Spain has a lot of good studies.
[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:17.780]  The US we're ass backwards, we're getting better.
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:22.180]  But Israel is a great place to look for like real science,
[01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:23.500]  which we totally discount
[01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:26.260]  because it wasn't made in America or by Americans.
[01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:28.420]  So what the fuck does it know?
[01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:33.140]  They don't even use inches, man.
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:35.020]  They're on this metric shit.
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:37.060]  Get with it.
[01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:39.780]  Millipeders centipeders.
[01:50:42.780 --> 01:50:44.820]  Hey man, we do know eighths and grams.
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:46.300]  So give us that much.
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:48.380]  Oh yeah, yeah, we're good on that.
[01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:50.420]  Yeah, like when I was doing industrial work,
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:53.780]  a lot of the stuff is,
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:57.060]  it's coming from Germany, Italy and all over the place.
[01:50:57.060 --> 01:51:00.140]  So I learned metric system like early on
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:04.420]  and I tell you man, like it's a good system.
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:06.820]  It's easier to like calculate in your head too.
[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:10.700]  You're so un-American dude.
[01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:11.540]  I know dude.
[01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:13.500]  I'm just joking, I'm just joking.
[01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:16.500]  I don't, I can't even say on air
[01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:19.260]  what my brother told me at one point.
[01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:22.420]  But I was like, yeah, I don't watch football or whatever.
[01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:24.020]  He's like, you don't watch football.
[01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:25.500]  You don't do this, don't do that.
[01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:27.060]  You're un-American.
[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:29.540]  Tell me a commie and the other choice things.
[01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:31.060]  I was like, whatever dude.
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:34.420]  Yeah, I'm in one of those places, which is funny.
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:38.260]  Cause I'm in a state that is notoriously blue
[01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:40.660]  and I live in a heavily red area and it's funny.
[01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:41.860]  I don't fish.
[01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:43.540]  I'm in a big fishing town
[01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:45.700]  and that's pretty much the only thing to do here
[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:47.500]  as far as like employment.
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:49.700]  So that's what a lot of people do here.
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:53.500]  And my, one of my neighbors, he's a crusty old boat captain.
[01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:56.500]  I love the guy cause he's a crusty old fucker.
[01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:59.740]  We get along well, but yeah, any chance he gets
[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:01.820]  he gives me shit for being like a land lover
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:02.900]  who doesn't eat seafood.
[01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:05.100]  He's like, why'd you even fucking move here?
[01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:09.740]  Why don't you go grow your dope, you fucking hippie.
[01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:11.780]  Pretty much, pretty much.
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:12.620]  He's awesome though.
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:13.460]  He's a rad dude.
[01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:14.500]  I'm always lawn.
[01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:16.300]  I'm always lawn out of the kindness of my heart.
[01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:21.020]  He's a good old dude, but yeah, proper, proper
[01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:22.780]  fucking boat captain, dude.
[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:24.540]  That's awesome.
[01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:26.540]  You got all those guys, man.
[01:52:26.540 --> 01:52:27.380]  Yeah.
[01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:30.860]  I'm like, I'll just hang out with you.
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:34.220]  One, one tote goes all day for that guy.
[01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:35.060]  Oh, nice.
[01:52:35.060 --> 01:52:36.860]  Well, at least he's blazing.
[01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:38.140]  You know what I mean?
[01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:38.980]  Yeah.
[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:39.820]  Yeah.
[01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:43.100]  One's better than none.
[01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:44.300]  Exactly.
[01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:45.820]  And I wish it only took one.
[01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:47.860]  I know.
[01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:51.060]  What are you smoking on this evening, Dave?
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:55.540]  Tonight, I was smoking on some Bubba Kush diamonds.
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:56.980]  Delicious.
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:58.620]  Okay.
[01:52:58.620 --> 01:52:59.860]  Fancy.
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:03.020]  Does it light off like incense and stuff?
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:05.300]  Like how the bud does when you smoke it?
[01:53:07.540 --> 01:53:10.500]  No, it doesn't light off like incense,
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:13.460]  but it has a very nice earthy,
[01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:15.980]  almost a little bit of a coffee flavor to it,
[01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:17.380]  but it's just delicious.
[01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:18.700]  Delicious.
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:20.180]  Well, we used to smoke it bad.
[01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:22.460]  And like, I don't know, is this something like
[01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:26.340]  when you lit up a joint or you're smoking a bowl, man?
[01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:30.180]  Like it just like, it had like an incense property, man.
[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:31.900]  Like, and that shit would linger around.
[01:53:31.900 --> 01:53:33.620]  Like you could leave, go to the store,
[01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:35.580]  come back hour later.
[01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:38.660]  That just that incense, he smells just like lingering
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:41.220]  around in the air from it and shit.
[01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:42.060]  I'm not kidding.
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:43.980]  Ugh, that shit was great.
[01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:48.100]  Joints tend to linger.
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:50.260]  So what, let's see if I still have this question
[01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:51.460]  start up here.
[01:53:51.460 --> 01:53:52.300]  Oh yeah, I do.
[01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:53.700]  Okay, it was from Jesse.
[01:53:55.260 --> 01:53:58.220]  Let me change the thing here, make it all cool and bubbles.
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:03.460]  Dopest dope you've ever smoked.
[01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:06.220]  Is there one experience that comes to mind?
[01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:07.260]  I know this is a hard question
[01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:09.780]  because there's different moments in life,
[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:13.620]  but is there one that just kind of smacked you in the face
[01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:15.340]  and maybe led to a good story?
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:21.740]  Hmm, well, I know like the first time I smoked white Rhino,
[01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:24.140]  that shit fucking rocked me, man.
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:26.260]  Like I couldn't even feel my neck
[01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:29.140]  and I had a job working for a bookie, you know?
[01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:31.100]  Like I was still a kid and shit.
[01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:34.460]  And yeah, I was supposed to be lighting up
[01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:35.940]  like these things in main shine
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:38.580]  in this dude's back of this dude's car.
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:41.580]  And like, I couldn't fucking hold my head up straight, man.
[01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:43.460]  And like, I was all fucked up.
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:47.700]  The car though, it was like the guy was a,
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:48.980]  he was a fucking cop.
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:51.420]  He was like a dirty corrupt cop, you know?
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:52.260]  Okay.
[01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:55.260]  So I was so worried that like he was gonna know,
[01:54:55.260 --> 01:54:56.460]  you know what I mean?
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:57.300]  He's gonna know.
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:59.300]  Later, like who the fuck, you know,
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:01.180]  like he's buying fucking main shine
[01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:04.140]  and placing bets with a bookie, like fuck him, you know?
[01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:04.980]  Right.
[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:06.140]  So yeah.
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:12.740]  So the first time I smoked Kim dog with fucking Kim dog,
[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:14.660]  like with Greg, you know?
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:15.700]  Wow.
[01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:19.540]  Yeah, that was fucking, took the bar up, you know?
[01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:20.380]  Yeah.
[01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:21.900]  Really fucking good.
[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:23.420]  Yeah, that was a good one.
[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:26.580]  And that's something that I find really cool
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:29.540]  that he has actually been brought into
[01:55:29.540 --> 01:55:33.020]  kind of the legal market on his own terms.
[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:36.700]  Like he didn't wanna get involved unless, you know,
[01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:38.100]  he could kind of do it his way.
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:40.540]  And someone made it happen.
[01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:43.460]  And if you like, this is almost worth like flying
[01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:45.020]  to the East coast for, but it's like,
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:50.020]  if you want Kim grown by Kim dog, it's real, it's possible.
[01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:53.060]  So that's amazing.
[01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:56.660]  That I imagine would raise the fucking bar.
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:57.500]  Yeah.
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:00.380]  Yeah, it's fucking, that was definitely,
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:02.700]  definitely a good one right there.
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:04.060]  Yeah.
[01:56:04.060 --> 01:56:04.900]  Yeah.
[01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:05.740]  Damn.
[01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:08.340]  That was one of them that, you know,
[01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:12.260]  the moments where I've had,
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:13.780]  when you said you can barely keep your head up,
[01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:15.180]  I'm like, oh, I've had those moments,
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:17.740]  but they were, you know, in the nineties,
[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:18.580]  when I was younger,
[01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:20.900]  when most of the weed really didn't have names.
[01:56:20.900 --> 01:56:24.100]  I'm like, I wish I could, but you know,
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:26.300]  and even then too, it's like, if it did have a name,
[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:30.020]  it was either AK 47 or ATF, which, you know,
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:33.020]  who knows what you can believe there.
[01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:35.180]  Shit, man.
[01:56:35.180 --> 01:56:36.420]  Yeah.
[01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:41.020]  So those memorable ones are always, always good.
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:43.100]  I smoked some NL5 As,
[01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:46.140]  when I, like before I had to drive
[01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:48.060]  like a considerable amount of weight
[01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:50.060]  from point A to point B,
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:52.220]  and point B was a little ways off.
[01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:53.460]  And I remember like,
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:56.500]  it's probably like the most scared I'd ever fucking been
[01:56:56.500 --> 01:56:58.980]  driving, you know, A to B.
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:00.340]  Oh man, dude.
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:03.860]  Yeah, that was rough.
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:04.700]  All right.
[01:57:04.700 --> 01:57:06.340]  Well, you made it.
[01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:07.180]  That's the good thing.
[01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:08.020]  Oh yeah.
[01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:09.660]  Yeah, touchdown, buddy.
[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:11.380]  Like a trooper.
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:12.740]  Oh shit.
[01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:14.820]  Well, we got one more question.
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:19.820]  I'm not sure, the Jalalabad strain,
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:22.740]  is that something that rings a bell for you?
[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:23.580]  Yeah.
[01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:25.860]  Oh, you're working the Jalalabad star?
[01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:29.020]  Nah, just straight Jalalabad.
[01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:29.860]  Oh, nice.
[01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:33.420]  Yeah.
[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:37.500]  So what is fancy about this
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:39.580]  other than it would be a triple word score
[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:41.300]  if we were playing Scrabble?
[01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:50.580]  Particular drug traits, man, and particular smells.
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:55.620]  But as with any type of land racy thing,
[01:57:55.620 --> 01:57:57.780]  or even like from hash farmers, you know,
[01:57:57.820 --> 01:58:00.700]  it's gonna be all over the place.
[01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:04.460]  So it definitely requires some work, you know,
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:10.300]  probably a couple years, three, four years maybe,
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:14.940]  you know, to get it kind of isolated more where you want it.
[01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:18.540]  So just something on the back burner
[01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:20.700]  to play around with, you know.
[01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:22.140]  That's good.
[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:24.740]  Yeah, exactly, it is fun.
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:26.780]  That's what it'll be.
[01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:29.500]  Nice, stinky lawn.
[01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:33.340]  It's, you know, when you appreciate the plant
[01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:35.100]  and you can take the time to do this,
[01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:38.380]  it really is fun to see what direction you can shift things
[01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:40.340]  and the influence you can have,
[01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:42.140]  and then, you know, kind of sculpting things.
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:44.980]  And that's, you know, probably why a lot of breeders
[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:49.180]  do other things, animals, dogs, they're both same thing.
[01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:52.980]  Animals are plants, flowers is what I was meaning to say,
[01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:54.020]  vegetables.
[01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:55.340]  Yeah.
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:56.180]  Yeah.
[01:58:56.180 --> 01:58:57.020]  Yeah.
[01:58:57.020 --> 01:59:00.700]  And so some things take longer than others.
[01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:02.900]  So I'm looking for that faster one.
[01:59:02.900 --> 01:59:04.980]  I'm gonna start getting into peppers next year.
[01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:06.820]  I'll start playing around with those.
[01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:08.580]  Yeah, that'd be cool, man.
[01:59:08.580 --> 01:59:10.100]  Yeah, growing all types of stuff.
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:11.860]  It's a lot of fun, man.
[01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:12.740]  It really is.
[01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:14.740]  Yep.
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:19.020]  Dave, are you still with us?
[01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:20.900]  I am always with you.
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:21.860]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:59:21.860 --> 01:59:24.020]  You're the wind beneath my wings, I forgot.
[01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:30.220]  What else do you have there in the bag for this evening?
[01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:34.780]  Did you have anything that was maybe CBD related?
[01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:38.300]  Kind of like the Himalayan herb here, my cherry wine.
[01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:41.220]  Sadly, that's not one of my personal focuses.
[01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:43.620]  Well, you suck, end of show.
[01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:44.860]  No.
[01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:46.420]  I'm sorry.
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:47.420]  No, no, it's all good.
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:50.580]  I know that there's plenty of use for it out there,
[01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:52.620]  plenty of people who are working with it.
[01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:55.140]  I don't have any awesome stories
[01:59:55.140 --> 01:59:57.980]  like smoking chem with chem, unfortunately.
[01:59:57.980 --> 01:59:59.620]  That's pretty fucking badass, man.
[01:59:59.620 --> 02:00:00.860]  Like, not gonna lie.
[02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:03.780]  But you were talking about peppers.
[02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:06.180]  We got some pepper seeds here.
[02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:07.700]  Oh, that's nice.
[02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:08.700]  Oh yeah.
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:10.020]  Where'd those come from?
[02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:10.860]  Baker's Pepper.
[02:00:10.860 --> 02:00:12.660]  Baker's Pepper's out of Florida.
[02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:14.620]  Oh, nice.
[02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:16.540]  Ooh, wow, okay.
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:21.280]  Oh, I don't know that one.
[02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:22.440]  Ghost Pepper.
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:23.480]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:25.840]  Yellow Ghost Pepper, Red Ghost Pepper.
[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:27.680]  Wow.
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:28.840]  Another Seven Pot.
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:33.140]  I'm looking for the Trinidad Scorpion.
[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:34.880]  Oh, you'll see.
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:35.720]  A couple other.
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:41.560]  Now, are these, if you were to, ah, there we go.
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:44.720]  If you were to plant these, realistically,
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:48.880]  you're able to increase your seeds with the next year?
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:50.200]  Is that something that you would do?
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:53.120]  Or, one in a bunch?
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:54.680]  I definitely could.
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:59.240]  They're so inexpensive to buy, for the most part.
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:01.800]  I don't mind picking up more seeds.
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:03.720]  Letting somebody else's really like,
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:05.320]  that's their main focus in life.
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:07.000]  I'll give you seven bucks, whatever.
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.160]  Five bucks.
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:09.000]  Oh yeah.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.200]  It's all good.
[02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:13.640]  Am I jumping into the wrong plant again?
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:14.480]  No.
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:15.320]  Just kidding.
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:17.480]  Oh yeah, man.
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:18.320]  Chocolate Pepper.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:19.160]  You gotta grow ginseng, man.
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:20.120]  Ginseng, five.
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:22.640]  I don't have any right now, but Chocolate Peppers.
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:25.360]  I fucking love that smoky flavor
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.280]  that Chocolate Peppers give off.
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:28.320]  I've never had that.
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:29.640]  I'll have to look for that.
[02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:32.000]  Now, is there anything, is the name misleading?
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.900]  Is there anything chocolatey about it?
[02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:36.920]  I did not get any chocolate flavor.
[02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:38.360]  Definitely a little bit of smoky flavor.
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:39.200]  It's just the look of it.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:41.000]  They have a very brown color to them.
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:45.180]  I'll look that one up.
[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:49.740]  I'm an extreme novice when it comes to peppers,
[02:01:49.740 --> 02:01:53.580]  other than this guy came into our retail shop
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:55.020]  and he had been growing peppers
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:58.140]  and he had made some just like hot sauces with them.
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:03.140]  And they were diluted, but it was like the one, three,
[02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:06.020]  and four as far as the hottest peppers out there
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:08.340]  on the Scoville units is what he was using.
[02:02:09.180 --> 02:02:11.460]  That was a fucking rush, man.
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:14.500]  I love, just a little corner, man.
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.260]  Each time, just a little bit more.
[02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:18.260]  You're just like, whoa.
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:19.380]  All right, I'm alive.
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:22.980]  I fucking loved it, dude.
[02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:26.060]  So yeah, I wanna grow some of my own and do that.
[02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:29.400]  We found if you pair it with cream cheese,
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:31.740]  it makes it a little bit more tolerable.
[02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:32.700]  Oh yeah.
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:35.980]  My boy, he makes the hot honey, dude.
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:37.420]  Like you were talking about biscuits
[02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:39.380]  and all that earlier, dude.
[02:02:39.380 --> 02:02:40.500]  Oh my God.
[02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:41.980]  He's like Reaper peppers.
[02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:44.380]  Like he only makes like crazy hot shit.
[02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:47.140]  Like, you know, like if you request it or whatever,
[02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:50.060]  but like, it's perfect, man.
[02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:51.740]  It's really good.
[02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:54.660]  And gotta get you some of that, dude.
[02:02:54.660 --> 02:02:55.500]  Yeah.
[02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:56.340]  Hot honey.
[02:02:57.780 --> 02:02:59.340]  Hot honey.
[02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:03.900]  We had one guy that, I don't know, he's just sick,
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:05.980]  but people, the regulars would come in.
[02:03:05.980 --> 02:03:07.500]  He's like, oh, you guys gotta try this.
[02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:11.080]  And he would just load the chip and give it to people.
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:13.740]  And I'm like, dude, you're gonna kill somebody
[02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:14.780]  with the amount.
[02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:18.140]  And for the most part, like everybody panicked,
[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:20.020]  but some people held it together.
[02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:22.300]  They tried to play it cool, but we're like,
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:24.140]  dude, we know you're fucking drinking
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:26.060]  as soon as you get out that door.
[02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:29.140]  Like we can see the sweat on your face.
[02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:31.860]  Sometimes you gotta entertain yourself
[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:33.340]  when you work in a dispensary.
[02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:34.180]  It's not all.
[02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:38.420]  You're in there for 10, 12 hours a day.
[02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:40.460]  You gotta find ways to entertain yourself.
[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:42.100]  Oh, Ganae, right, man.
[02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:44.620]  We did the gallon of milk challenge at a shop
[02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:46.060]  back in the day with the guy,
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:48.100]  like knowing what would happen to him.
[02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:52.140]  Man, he puked all over the back parking lot
[02:03:52.140 --> 02:03:54.180]  and nobody cleaned it up.
[02:03:54.180 --> 02:03:55.900]  And it was like summertime and like,
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:03:59.020]  the next day the smell started coming in.
[02:03:59.020 --> 02:04:00.660]  And I was like, oh my God, dude.
[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:03.100]  Worst idea ever.
[02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:09.080]  The worst idea ever is pissing out a campfire.
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:09.920]  Yeah, it's not.
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:11.220]  That smells horrible.
[02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:15.060]  Dude, it sounds fun and games until you're downwind.
[02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:15.900]  Don't do it.
[02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:17.620]  It's one of the worst smells ever.
[02:04:17.620 --> 02:04:18.780]  Don't do it.
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:21.120]  Having a piss bait or whatever.
[02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:25.180]  And I highly recommend thoroughly washing your hands
[02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:26.860]  if you're making hot sauce.
[02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:29.260]  And then going, if you're gonna go to the bathroom,
[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:32.020]  cause oh my God, I made that mistake one time.
[02:04:32.020 --> 02:04:34.660]  And my dick was on fire.
[02:04:34.660 --> 02:04:35.500]  I'm not gonna lie.
[02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:39.500]  It was a really steaming bowl of dick soup.
[02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:40.380]  Yeah, dude.
[02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:42.140]  Fucking straight chorizo.
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:47.980]  Yeah, that shit hurts, man.
[02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:50.340]  Yeah, you eat it too hot, man.
[02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:52.900]  You fucking get sting ring and fuck around
[02:04:52.900 --> 02:04:53.980]  and don't wash your hands.
[02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:56.100]  You get some old sting pain.
[02:04:56.100 --> 02:04:56.940]  Shit.
[02:04:58.060 --> 02:04:58.900]  I know.
[02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:00.780]  No good.
[02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:02.260]  No.
[02:05:02.260 --> 02:05:04.580]  Did you stick your anus in like a cup of milk
[02:05:04.580 --> 02:05:05.600]  or something or?
[02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:09.200]  No, I just, I ran it under some water
[02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:10.740]  and it really didn't do anything.
[02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:12.520]  It just, I had to let it dissipate.
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:14.960]  It was about 10 minutes of agony.
[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:18.320]  I just wonder if like you stuck your anus in milk
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:21.080]  or put Ford anus on your milk, I guess would work too.
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:23.360]  And it was delayed too.
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:25.200]  It probably wasn't immediate.
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:26.080]  It wasn't immediate.
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:26.920]  It was delayed.
[02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:30.040]  Like I zip up and I'm like, oh, what is burning?
[02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:31.440]  Like what the fuck's going on?
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:33.160]  Oh shit, I didn't really wash my hands.
[02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:35.280]  And then it just kept intensifying.
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:38.200]  It's just like, oh my God.
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:40.980]  Yeah, that's bad, dude.
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:45.360]  I had a buddy get some fucking all advanced nutrients
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:49.120]  pH down on his fucking fingers and use the bathroom.
[02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:52.320]  And it like lit his dick up so bad, like burn it,
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:54.160]  you know, like chemical burn.
[02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:56.040]  And then his old lady almost left him
[02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:59.440]  because she thought that he like caught herpes
[02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:01.360]  from fucking whores or something.
[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:03.520]  You're fucking great, man.
[02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:06.680]  You're fucking great, man.
[02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:09.760]  He's like, no, it's acid.
[02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:10.720]  It's just your dick.
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:12.880]  What's your dick doing around acid?
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:14.920]  Yeah, you're messing around them whores.
[02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:19.000]  Man, that's not what I want to explain.
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.240]  Yeah, no fucking doubt, man.
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:25.000]  Yeah, so be careful with the peppers
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:26.720]  and the pH down, you know.
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:30.200]  Wash your hands.
[02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:32.000]  Yeah, man, definitely.
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:34.840]  Wash the dick beaters off after you work
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:36.800]  and before you go to the bathroom.
[02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:40.920]  It saves you your marriage.
[02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:46.240]  The more you know.
[02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:49.480]  Which yes, thank you.
[02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:52.080]  Wish we had that shooting star icon.
[02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:53.920]  We used to have that in here.
[02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:54.760]  Yeah.
[02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:55.800]  I changed the banners.
[02:06:55.800 --> 02:06:57.880]  You're gonna fuck around and get sued, man.
[02:06:57.880 --> 02:06:59.920]  You're gonna have Bruce Willis after you.
[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:02.960]  You're gonna have fucking NBC after you.
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:05.400]  Hans Gruber is coming after you.
[02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:07.480]  Hans Gruber, yeah.
[02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:11.280]  Well, I know what happens to him.
[02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:12.200]  Hell yeah.
[02:07:12.200 --> 02:07:13.040]  He's screwed.
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:15.120]  He goes right up somewhere.
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:18.960]  Yeah, and that's actually the Nakatomi Plaza.
[02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:21.840]  I am, it'll be ready in December.
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:24.040]  So it's dropping for Christmas.
[02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:24.880]  And that was great.
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:26.960]  Oh, perfect, perfect.
[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:27.800]  Yes.
[02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:29.200]  That is perfect.
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:31.000]  Die Hard, right?
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.200]  It's a Christmas movie, right?
[02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:33.800]  Yep, it is.
[02:07:33.800 --> 02:07:35.280]  It is, 100%.
[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:37.600]  Yeah, Die Hard and Bad Santa, dude.
[02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:43.400]  I watch the Die Hards and Home Alone every year.
[02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:45.040]  Like those, Bad Santa's good.
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:45.880]  That's in there.
[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:48.040]  Elf is in there, but it's not Christmas
[02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:51.880]  unless I get my Die Hards in and my Home Alones.
[02:07:51.880 --> 02:07:53.600]  Yeah, gotta have it, man.
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:55.160]  That's just how I roll.
[02:07:55.160 --> 02:07:57.000]  Fuck yeah, dude.
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.640]  I like how you move, Chad.
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.000]  I like how you move.
[02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:03.000]  Living dangerously.
[02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.120]  Yeah, dude.
[02:08:04.120 --> 02:08:06.000]  So what else you got in the bag?
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.080]  Anything else in the bag?
[02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:10.120]  I know we're a little over a couple hours already here.
[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:11.720]  What's in the box?
[02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:13.600]  What's in the box?
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:15.120]  What's in the box?
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:17.200]  12 Monkeys is a great movie.
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:18.240]  Yeah, it is.
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:20.680]  That is an exceptional movie
[02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:23.240]  with Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt.
[02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:26.280]  That movie, along with California,
[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:28.320]  made me think that Brad Pitt was okay.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.600]  I'm like, all right, you're not just a pretty boy.
[02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:32.280]  You can actually make some decent movies.
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:35.040]  And then Fight Club too, but 12 Monkeys.
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:36.840]  12 Monkeys hit it out of the park.
[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:38.760]  Yeah, yeah, that was a good one.
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:41.040]  I saw that in a theater the same year
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:43.880]  as Pulp Fiction coming out and stuff.
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:48.160]  Yeah, he had that little part in True Romance too.
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:49.800]  Smoking up a little honey berries.
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:52.040]  Like, don't you fucking condescend me, man.
[02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:53.160]  I'll fucking kill you.
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:56.400]  I always thought that was funny.
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:57.840]  To Tony Soprano.
[02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:01.640]  Yeah, Tony Soprano, man, people.
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:02.560]  Fucking great.
[02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:05.320]  That was a good movie.
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:06.480]  It was, man.
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:08.960]  Let's see here.
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:11.640]  Sliced seeds that are gonna be going down.
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:13.120]  You can tell they're really important
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:16.280]  because of the type of baggie that they're in.
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:17.880]  Normally the shittier the bag,
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:21.960]  the better the beans and my little deal there.
[02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:27.560]  Got a few Kim D to the local H to run through.
[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:29.840]  This would be cool.
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:31.680]  Nice.
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:34.040]  Yeah, got some Screaming Eagle
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:38.200]  to the Airborne times Grail Haze.
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:41.160]  That ought to be pretty fun too.
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:44.320]  And then some local H, Cindy 99,
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:46.720]  where I reverse Cindy on that.
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:49.560]  And then I made the Grim Dog
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:51.720]  and then I made the Grim Dog D.
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:53.800]  So I got a few Grim Dog Ds
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:57.040]  because I was kind of digging that.
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:01.080]  It was like this weird, nasty fucking pineapple Fina
[02:10:01.080 --> 02:10:03.040]  that I had that yielded like crazy
[02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:05.480]  that don't fucking hash, man.
[02:10:05.480 --> 02:10:08.760]  So there's some other ones I'll be looking
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:10.880]  to play around with.
[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:15.560]  Got some Blue Moon Sean F2s to pop as well.
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:17.560]  So it's gonna be a cool winter, man.
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:18.920]  It's gonna be real cool.
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:19.760]  Yeah.
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:20.600]  It is.
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:22.600]  It's gonna be cool, cool shit.
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:25.160]  And I'd love to see what comes out of it.
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:27.120]  What comes from those projects?
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:28.600]  Oh yeah, yeah, man.
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:32.800]  A lot of it, it won't even be really a breeding project.
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:35.800]  A lot of it's just doing how you do, man.
[02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:38.560]  You just finding a keep or just keep around and smoke.
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:42.160]  Because at the end of the day,
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:43.840]  I'm a fucking pothead, man.
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:45.960]  I like to grow weed and smoke weed.
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:49.760]  Sometimes I got no intent of breeding anything further.
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:51.840]  I'm good.
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.680]  Just looking to find a good clone,
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:57.120]  keeping around and rinse, wash, repeat.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:57.960]  Yeah.
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:10:59.320]  Head stash, man.
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:00.560]  You gotta have the good head stash.
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:03.240]  That's a problem I face here too.
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:05.600]  It's like I just recently kind of cleared the tent.
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:08.160]  I've kept only a couple of things.
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:09.480]  I had things that were good,
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:12.280]  but I'm looking for great
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:14.400]  and I'm starting to hunt again.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:15.360]  I kept a couple of things
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:17.560]  that are just freaking phenomenal for me.
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:22.000]  But I've only got limited space, unfortunately.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:24.880]  Gotta make those tough decisions.
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:26.000]  You really do, man.
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.440]  And you really gotta get very nitpicky with it.
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:32.000]  And when it goes like year to year,
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:35.080]  you always got that one.
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:37.440]  It's always on the cut on that chopping block.
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:40.080]  And if you gotta ask yourself, man,
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:42.280]  you should have chopped it like yesterday.
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:43.920]  That's yeah.
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:45.320]  Really good advice, man.
[02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:47.320]  Really good advice for getting through shit there.
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:49.880]  Because I would take three runs
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:51.400]  before I would make a decision.
[02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:53.680]  Three runs is six months,
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:54.840]  if you're doing perpetual.
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:58.760]  So six months to decide if I'm gonna keep or not.
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:11:59.600]  Yeah.
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:02.160]  It's just like, you know where your bar is, right?
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:05.280]  And if it doesn't meet or exceed,
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:06.680]  then it needs to go.
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:08.840]  No matter how pretty it is,
[02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:11.960]  if it ain't scratching that itch.
[02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:14.160]  And you know the jar test will never lie.
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:18.280]  You got jars and ones are staying full
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:19.720]  and other ones are emptying out,
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:22.680]  then there's your answer, man.
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:23.520]  Yeah.
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:24.360]  Definitely.
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:26.240]  Yeah.
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:27.600]  Just gotta go.
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:29.440]  And you don't have to always,
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:32.120]  you got friends and they dig it.
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:34.200]  They give the claim to them.
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:36.160]  And maybe if you wanna revisit it one day,
[02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:37.360]  it'll be around still.
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:39.240]  So it's that.
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:41.520]  Yeah.
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:43.520]  And that's definitely the benefit of getting it around.
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:46.040]  Giving it around and sharing.
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:46.880]  Yeah.
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:47.720]  Sharing is caring.
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:52.760]  It also might save your ass in a pinch too.
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:53.760]  You know what I mean?
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:56.120]  You might, ass might burn down
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:59.240]  or you might get locked up or who knows.
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:00.080]  Yeah.
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:00.920]  You know?
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:02.480]  And then you still got your shit,
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:03.880]  you know, with good friends.
[02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:06.680]  Yeah.
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:09.840]  And then that's, you know, it's important
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:12.120]  because we all talk about,
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:14.920]  well, some people talk about the frequency
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:17.680]  or the rate of which we kind of lose strains now
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:20.680]  because people are looking on to the next thing.
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:23.680]  It's like, they have a really awesome base ingredient
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:26.040]  and then everybody works it with something else.
[02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:27.800]  And then they forget the base ingredient
[02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:29.360]  and nobody kept really a backup.
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:31.960]  And you're just like, oh, we lost that one.
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:34.160]  Son of a bitch.
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:35.000]  Yeah.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.320]  Yeah.
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:37.360]  Yeah.
[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:38.840]  It's like that, man.
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:42.600]  Such is life, you know?
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:43.440]  Yeah.
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:47.040]  We put out some good information
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:50.240]  and when you're a good dude and you put things out,
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:54.120]  you know, things come back to you at the right times.
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:54.960]  Yeah.
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.280]  That's what we all hope for.
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:57.440]  Yeah, man.
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:13:58.280]  That's the deal.
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:00.520]  You know, what they say, if you really love something,
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:03.600]  you turn it loose so it'll come back to you,
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:04.880]  some shit like that.
[02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:07.960]  Or if we were in Wayne's world,
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:10.880]  if you're gonna spew, spew into the, no.
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:11.720]  Yeah.
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:12.560]  Yeah.
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:13.400]  Yeah.
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:14.240]  Yeah.
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:15.760]  I thought I'd have to toss that one in there.
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:16.600]  Well.
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:19.000]  My buddy, Nick, he fucking,
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.760]  he was like, kept running into fucking Bob Weir
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:24.360]  all over the fucking place.
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:25.720]  Oh, wow.
[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:26.840]  Yeah.
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:29.000]  And Phil Lesh, too.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.680]  And like, he was like, trying to get Phil Lesh
[02:14:31.680 --> 02:14:36.200]  to sign a fucking barf bag for him, like, off of a plane.
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:38.640]  Because they got some other guy,
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:41.080]  I forgot who it was, to sign one
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:43.440]  and say something about doing his mom.
[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:46.880]  So he was like, asking Phil Lesh in front of his wife
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:51.440]  or something to sign this fucking barf bag,
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:53.160]  saying something about doing your mom.
[02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:56.640]  And he was like, so off, thought about it and shit.
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:57.920]  Pretty funny.
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:14:59.400]  That's a weird one.
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:02.000]  That's a weird one.
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.280]  Yeah, pretty cool.
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:05.880]  It's pretty cool.
[02:15:05.880 --> 02:15:06.920]  Yeah, dude.
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:10.120]  I can't even.
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:11.280]  Yeah.
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:13.240]  Things that get signed.
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:15.320]  Yeah, yeah, man.
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:20.320]  Yeah, it's pretty interesting what we collect and shit.
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:23.400]  Yeah, your mom was here, Aldridge.
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:24.800]  Your mom was here.
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:26.720]  It reminds me, you were on,
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:29.800]  I think you were on the Caribou Heart Show recently.
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:32.080]  Yeah, yeah, those things are cool.
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:33.720]  Those guys like to have a good time.
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:36.720]  And they've got, I don't think Prophet was on the episode,
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:37.960]  but they've got,
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:39.680]  I don't think Prophet was on the episode,
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:42.840]  but one of the guys who's typically on the show
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:44.080]  is Prophet.
[02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:46.200]  And they all kind of have this running joke
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:49.800]  of like writing Prophet's mom was here
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:51.520]  on like Porta Potties everywhere.
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:53.760]  And usually like every couple of weeks,
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:57.640]  they'll put up some pictures of Prophet's mom was here.
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:15:59.280]  I was like, oh, that's cold, man.
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:02.240]  Cause it's like a two year joke at this point.
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:05.280]  Yeah, you gotta like make sure it ends up
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:08.480]  in lots of like public bathrooms all over the country.
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:10.440]  So it's like no matter where the sea goes
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:12.120]  to take a leak, you know?
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:12.960]  Yeah.
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:13.800]  Man.
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:16.960]  My mom got around, shit.
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:20.560]  I know, I may have created a few.
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:21.720]  I like stickering.
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:23.560]  Stickering's my thing though.
[02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:24.400]  Yeah.
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:26.560]  Stickers, stickers, you can just be like,
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:28.560]  oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:30.080]  And then kind of peel it off.
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:31.560]  It's a little bit easier if you get caught,
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:32.920]  which you really never do.
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:35.600]  But it's good to have plan B.
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:38.440]  You just gotta hit them with the holy shit.
[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:39.280]  What's up?
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:41.800]  And then just take off running, you know?
[02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:44.760]  20 years ago, man, when I was skateboarding all the time,
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:46.080]  yeah, I could run from a cop.
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:49.240]  Nowadays I would get half a block and be like,
[02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:51.040]  all right, you got me.
[02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:54.040]  You gotta think smarter, right?
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:55.840]  You got any donuts left?
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:17:00.280]  You gotta rely on your head, not so much your legs.
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:02.240]  So all you gotta do is be able to make it
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:03.440]  around a corner.
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:06.280]  First car you see, you need to dip up under it
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:08.200]  and Kate Fear that motherfucker.
[02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:09.600]  They'll run right fucking by you.
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:12.280]  Be like, that motherfucker's fast.
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:13.360]  That's how you do it.
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:16.440]  All right, I'm gonna throw it.
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:20.360]  Kate Fear was the one with the Wahlberg in it, right?
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:21.720]  No, that's Fear.
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:23.800]  Kate Fear's Robert is De Niro.
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:24.640]  De Niro.
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:25.480]  Oh, yeah.
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:27.960]  No, De Niro was the dad.
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:29.160]  No fucking.
[02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:30.080]  Nick Nolte.
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:31.360]  Nick Nolte, yeah.
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:35.920]  He was, what he kept calling him, not attorney,
[02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:38.520]  fucking counselor.
[02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:39.360]  Counselor.
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:42.600]  He was like stalking him because he caught time
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:44.280]  on account of his ass and shit.
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:46.440]  He's stalking him and his family,
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:49.080]  trying to ruin his life or whatever.
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:52.600]  He was like smoking the cigar in the movie theater,
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:54.920]  laughing all obnoxious and shit.
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:56.080]  Yep.
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:58.480]  I need to go back and watch this.
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:01.040]  Fear is Marky Mark punching himself in the chest
[02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:05.280]  to make it look like the dad has beaten him.
[02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:06.680]  Right, okay.
[02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:09.520]  I thought I had a cool connection there,
[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:11.160]  but nope, wrong movie.
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:13.800]  Sorry, false start.
[02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:15.560]  Penalized me five yards.
[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:17.360]  Penalized me five beans.
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:22.640]  I actually, I have all my other seeds here,
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:25.640]  but I'm like the few things that I did get
[02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:27.600]  over this last time,
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:28.880]  I've already shown.
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:31.760]  It's all good, man.
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:32.600]  I know.
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:33.440]  Maybe more.
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:37.680]  I don't, I'm into popping right now.
[02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:39.760]  I need to go through things.
[02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:42.160]  I'm starting to get a good collection.
[02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:43.640]  Yeah, that's the thing, man.
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:48.640]  Get the popping and just do as much as you can.
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:49.880]  Yeah.
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:51.960]  And if you ain't got enough space,
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:54.000]  talk some friends in the local area
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.400]  into letting you put a tent over there.
[02:18:58.200 --> 02:18:59.360]  Like this bloom, I'm small, man.
[02:18:59.360 --> 02:19:01.240]  Like you don't have, like pheno hunting,
[02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:03.120]  you know, you don't have to veg out
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:04.480]  like some big beast, you know.
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:06.560]  You see it big enough to get a clone off of it
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:08.040]  and find the winner.
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:10.720]  And, you know, after a year, you know,
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:13.280]  you have a good little winner circle going.
[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:14.120]  Right.
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:17.840]  And that's, these, you know, the 10,
[02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:19.880]  the Nakatomi Plaza I just popped,
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:22.040]  I was thinking of doing something like that
[02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:25.280]  is just probably flowering in one gallons.
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:28.400]  Because, you know, it's just kind of a formality
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:30.320]  at this point, but I just still want to do it.
[02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:32.200]  And I'm documenting it for everybody too.
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:34.120]  So everybody can go and reference
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:36.160]  and see, you know, exactly what came out of it
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:38.200]  and how everything goes.
[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:39.680]  So that'll be nice.
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:42.160]  You know, I'm working on my little back description
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:43.480]  like you got going on.
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:44.320]  Nice, man.
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:45.160]  Nice.
[02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:48.000]  Yeah, people, people thank you for it for sure.
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:51.960]  Yeah, it'll definitely be well received, man.
[02:19:51.960 --> 02:19:53.560]  Because like when I'm growing my pack
[02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:56.520]  of Nakatomi, Nakatami.
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:57.360]  Nakatami.
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:19:59.400]  Nakatami Plazas.
[02:20:01.800 --> 02:20:04.920]  I'll be stoked, be like, okay, all right.
[02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:07.640]  It's got a stretch double and fucking, all right.
[02:20:07.640 --> 02:20:10.560]  Need to keep it kind of heavy or something.
[02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:12.320]  I'll be stoked on it.
[02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:13.160]  Yep, yep.
[02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:16.880]  No, I definitely, I'm getting those notes and yeah.
[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:17.720]  No, thank you.
[02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:19.600]  Thank you for setting an example again too.
[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:22.720]  Cause that's not, that's something that we see a lot of,
[02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:25.080]  unfortunately, but, and then, you know,
[02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:27.160]  just kind of what we're referencing and talking about
[02:20:27.160 --> 02:20:28.920]  Dave's showing here on the back of the pack.
[02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:31.800]  But, you know, this is, this is information
[02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:33.360]  about what to expect.
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:35.680]  And it does help people make decisions of,
[02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:37.400]  am I going to run these together?
[02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:39.520]  Do I have time to get this done?
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:40.640]  Yeah, man.
[02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:44.080]  Cause like primarily like I'm a fucking grower
[02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:47.480]  and I like to smoke weed and I like to grow weed.
[02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:50.560]  So like, it's always kind of figured like,
[02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:52.680]  oh, this is what I want to know.
[02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:56.680]  Like I wish I would have that at a time.
[02:20:56.680 --> 02:21:00.960]  So just kind of figured other people would dig that.
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:03.640]  Can you explain what a robo-trisk,
[02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:06.600]  robo-trip-esque type high is?
[02:21:06.600 --> 02:21:08.040]  Robo-tripping, son.
[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:08.880]  Yeah, dude.
[02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:10.680]  Like you never, you never.
[02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:11.680]  Tussin.
[02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:12.560]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:13.840]  The tussin, bro.
[02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:14.680]  Tussin.
[02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:16.480]  Yeah.
[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:19.520]  You got all the wah-wah in the head.
[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:23.080]  Tussin and no-dos was like the eighth grade good time.
[02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:23.920]  Yeah.
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:26.360]  That and maybe a gas, or a can of gas.
[02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:29.640]  You see, Chad, you know how to party, man.
[02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:32.480]  Yes.
[02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:34.800]  You're going to crush it down in Mexico, bro.
[02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:37.200]  I get down, dude.
[02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:40.080]  Oh shit.
[02:21:40.080 --> 02:21:41.920]  Yeah, I already know.
[02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:43.640]  Hell yeah, man.
[02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:47.400]  Yeah, yeah, I got some weird descriptions on shit,
[02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:49.280]  but see like the people that get it,
[02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:51.080]  they're like, they really get it, you know?
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:52.920]  And the ones that don't, it's like,
[02:21:52.920 --> 02:21:54.720]  well, you know, it's probably a good thing.
[02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:57.880]  You don't know what robo-tripping is, but that's cool.
[02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:01.640]  It's the verbal way of saying
[02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:04.080]  you must be this high to ride this ride.
[02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:05.160]  Yeah.
[02:22:05.160 --> 02:22:06.640]  Something like that, yeah.
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:10.280]  It'll get you in the zone for sure.
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:13.760]  Let's see.
[02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:15.800]  Well, I don't know.
[02:22:16.640 --> 02:22:17.840]  I'm kind of tapped out.
[02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:19.040]  I don't know about you guys.
[02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:22.120]  You guys are ahead of me on time too.
[02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:26.520]  Yup, drinking beers and fucking doing it.
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:28.400]  Living.
[02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:31.080]  I'm in the L-I-V-I-N, dog, living.
[02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:36.390]  All right, all right, all right.
[02:22:36.390 --> 02:22:38.830]  Got any more seeds, Chad?
[02:22:38.830 --> 02:22:41.070]  Not sure if you did, man.
[02:22:41.070 --> 02:22:41.910]  All right.
[02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:43.710]  All right.
[02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:49.070]  No, I'm not gonna say it.
[02:22:49.070 --> 02:22:50.350]  Oh yeah.
[02:22:50.350 --> 02:22:52.350]  Yeah, fuck yeah.
[02:22:52.350 --> 02:22:54.190]  You already had me thinking about the dude
[02:22:54.190 --> 02:22:57.550]  you were talking about, Marky Mark himself in the chest.
[02:22:57.550 --> 02:22:59.750]  That's like a Wolf of Wall Street with him.
[02:23:00.670 --> 02:23:04.550]  Oh, you know, doing the little money song and shit.
[02:23:05.670 --> 02:23:07.750]  You know what I'm talking about, Dave?
[02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:08.590]  Yup.
[02:23:08.590 --> 02:23:11.270]  I can't believe Tommy Chong was cellmates with that guy.
[02:23:12.030 --> 02:23:17.030]  And inspired him to write the book, or hence the movie.
[02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:19.310]  That's kind of fucking crazy.
[02:23:19.310 --> 02:23:21.590]  I didn't know that, that's awesome.
[02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:24.270]  Yeah, when Tommy Chong was locked up for his bongs
[02:23:24.270 --> 02:23:26.270]  and all that shit way back.
[02:23:26.270 --> 02:23:28.550]  Yeah, and they sent Jordan Belfort
[02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:31.550]  in the little minimum security camp.
[02:23:31.550 --> 02:23:35.830]  And they were little cubicle mates, I guess.
[02:23:35.830 --> 02:23:37.630]  Cubicle mates.
[02:23:37.630 --> 02:23:39.590]  Yeah, they put them in dorms, man.
[02:23:39.630 --> 02:23:41.070]  They don't put them in cells.
[02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:43.830]  They're like, they're so low security,
[02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:46.630]  there's not even a fence around it, you know?
[02:23:46.630 --> 02:23:47.470]  Wow.
[02:23:48.590 --> 02:23:50.950]  Basically, it's what we call a vacation.
[02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:54.750]  But yeah, the food's better.
[02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:56.670]  Yeah, a bunch of dick soup.
[02:24:00.310 --> 02:24:03.070]  That has made so many beautiful references tonight.
[02:24:03.070 --> 02:24:04.430]  I love it.
[02:24:04.430 --> 02:24:07.430]  Yeah, like, I said, take it home with you, man.
[02:24:07.430 --> 02:24:09.030]  Like, you're good now.
[02:24:09.070 --> 02:24:10.590]  You know this song?
[02:24:10.590 --> 02:24:14.110]  You can jam it, you know, to brighten up your day.
[02:24:14.110 --> 02:24:15.830]  You can carry a song in your heart
[02:24:16.750 --> 02:24:18.470]  as you go through the day working.
[02:24:18.470 --> 02:24:22.150]  Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
[02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:26.550]  And it pairs really well with Pussopher's Country Boner.
[02:24:30.190 --> 02:24:33.590]  I don't know if you've ever heard Country Boner before, but.
[02:24:33.590 --> 02:24:36.110]  Oh, dude, it's like a great dude.
[02:24:36.110 --> 02:24:37.550]  You'll love it.
[02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:39.630]  You'll be thanking me for months to come, dude.
[02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:42.110]  You'll be like, man, dude, you changed my life.
[02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:45.270]  Yeah, it's how I roll, dude.
[02:24:46.670 --> 02:24:49.670]  I was on one path, now I'm on a whole new trajectory.
[02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:51.270]  Yeah, that's the whole thing, man.
[02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:53.110]  Fucking, you jam that shit
[02:24:53.110 --> 02:24:55.950]  instead of setting your alarm clock at like 6 a.m.,
[02:24:55.950 --> 02:24:59.150]  set it for like 6.04, you know what I mean?
[02:24:59.150 --> 02:25:02.470]  Get out of the wave, you know what I mean?
[02:25:02.470 --> 02:25:04.670]  Just sidestep that shit a little bit.
[02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:06.230]  You'll be doing your own thing.
[02:25:07.230 --> 02:25:10.430]  The amount of things that are out there and that are real.
[02:25:10.430 --> 02:25:12.510]  Like, I imagine if I Google that,
[02:25:12.510 --> 02:25:14.910]  I am gonna come across something real.
[02:25:14.910 --> 02:25:17.310]  And I came across something the other day.
[02:25:17.310 --> 02:25:20.470]  It was a movie poster for a horror movie
[02:25:20.470 --> 02:25:22.670]  called The VelociPastor.
[02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:23.950]  Yes.
[02:25:23.950 --> 02:25:28.950]  Because he is a pastor who also turns into a dinosaur
[02:25:29.430 --> 02:25:33.190]  and kills people and has to save someone from ninjas.
[02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:35.750]  And I forgot what else.
[02:25:36.270 --> 02:25:39.390]  I skimmed through it, but I Googled it.
[02:25:39.390 --> 02:25:41.710]  It's on YouTube, it's a real fucking movie.
[02:25:41.710 --> 02:25:42.550]  The VelociPastor.
[02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:43.750]  It's a real movie.
[02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:46.190]  Look up something called Llamageddon.
[02:25:46.190 --> 02:25:47.470]  That's another good one.
[02:25:47.470 --> 02:25:48.470]  Oh no.
[02:25:48.470 --> 02:25:50.830]  Are any llamas hurt in the making of this film?
[02:25:51.870 --> 02:25:53.110]  Tons.
[02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.950]  Dude.
[02:25:53.950 --> 02:25:54.790]  Tons.
[02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:56.270]  Just people.
[02:25:56.270 --> 02:25:57.230]  Tons.
[02:25:57.230 --> 02:25:58.470]  We just shaved them up.
[02:25:58.470 --> 02:26:01.830]  They were alpacas, you know, made them look like llamas.
[02:26:01.870 --> 02:26:06.270]  So, you know, we bypass that whole fiasco.
[02:26:07.390 --> 02:26:08.990]  My buddy turned me on to one,
[02:26:08.990 --> 02:26:11.230]  a real fucked up B rated movie.
[02:26:11.230 --> 02:26:12.230]  It's called Rubber.
[02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:14.510]  Yes.
[02:26:14.510 --> 02:26:17.390]  About the time he kills people.
[02:26:17.390 --> 02:26:18.350]  Yeah.
[02:26:18.350 --> 02:26:19.750]  Yeah, check it out.
[02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:21.670]  Yeah, it's a fucking tire.
[02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:25.350]  Like it has its own, like, you know, it's alive.
[02:26:25.350 --> 02:26:27.350]  It has mind control powers.
[02:26:27.350 --> 02:26:30.350]  Yeah, it blows people's heads off, you know.
[02:26:30.350 --> 02:26:32.630]  Kind of like how Scanners was.
[02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:33.470]  Okay.
[02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:36.950]  I see somebody in the chat,
[02:26:36.950 --> 02:26:38.910]  Rusty Nails posted Sharknado.
[02:26:38.910 --> 02:26:41.470]  Yeah, Sharknado is the one that started them all.
[02:26:42.590 --> 02:26:45.310]  I think I have like one through three on DVD even.
[02:26:46.190 --> 02:26:47.430]  Sharknado.
[02:26:47.430 --> 02:26:48.550]  We had a plan.
[02:26:48.550 --> 02:26:51.350]  We were gonna start doing like a mystery science theater
[02:26:51.350 --> 02:26:54.790]  thing on the discord with like movies like this.
[02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:56.430]  But then it came back like, yeah,
[02:26:56.430 --> 02:26:58.110]  we might get sued or some shit.
[02:26:58.150 --> 02:27:01.270]  So all it takes is that one person to be like,
[02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:04.710]  well, actually the FGT is a good organization
[02:27:04.710 --> 02:27:05.990]  that keeps things honest.
[02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:09.470]  You motherfucking Friginians have gone too far.
[02:27:09.470 --> 02:27:13.070]  Yeah, I was like, yeah, you're right, man, you're right.
[02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:17.350]  I need to go fucking back to the joint for, you know,
[02:27:17.350 --> 02:27:22.030]  playing pirated versions of Rubber or whatever.
[02:27:23.430 --> 02:27:26.430]  What are you here for, pirate and Rubber?
[02:27:26.430 --> 02:27:28.550]  Nobody mess with this guy.
[02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:30.110]  Yeah, yeah, buddy.
[02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:37.590]  The Sharknado is like, I'm waiting for,
[02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:38.950]  I still say this too, is, you know,
[02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:40.750]  cause there's all the grows in Oklahoma
[02:27:40.750 --> 02:27:42.590]  and there's a lot of tornadoes out there.
[02:27:42.590 --> 02:27:44.110]  I'm still waiting for the newscast
[02:27:44.110 --> 02:27:45.710]  talking about the Weednado.
[02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:47.750]  Cause you know, it's gonna happen at some point.
[02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:50.590]  It's gonna rip up a facility and plants are gonna be flying
[02:27:50.590 --> 02:27:52.950]  everywhere and I feel bad for the facility,
[02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:54.990]  but I wanna see that news report.
[02:27:55.030 --> 02:27:57.710]  You know, they're gonna be like, Weednado.
[02:27:57.710 --> 02:28:00.590]  Hey, at minimum, dude, you just made a straight name.
[02:28:03.470 --> 02:28:05.350]  You know what I mean?
[02:28:05.350 --> 02:28:08.390]  Oh shit, I need to check the dot com,
[02:28:08.390 --> 02:28:10.150]  see if it's available still.
[02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:13.110]  Oh yeah, yeah, it's all available, man.
[02:28:13.110 --> 02:28:16.390]  You just gotta say it more times than the next guy
[02:28:16.390 --> 02:28:17.390]  and then it's yours.
[02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:22.270]  Yeah, right, actually one of the,
[02:28:24.270 --> 02:28:28.230]  one of the parents in Nakatomi Plaza is kind of like that.
[02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:33.230]  There's two different strains with the same name,
[02:28:34.110 --> 02:28:36.230]  completely different parents.
[02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:40.990]  I'm just like, get it together industry.
[02:28:40.990 --> 02:28:45.390]  That's why we need to make up names and shit like that.
[02:28:45.390 --> 02:28:46.230]  I don't know.
[02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:50.270]  So Duke, when are you releasing Dick Soup
[02:28:50.270 --> 02:28:52.910]  and what do you think would be a good parents
[02:28:52.910 --> 02:28:53.990]  for that cross?
[02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.830]  Yes.
[02:28:56.310 --> 02:28:59.430]  Let's see, Dick Soup, that would probably have to,
[02:28:59.430 --> 02:29:03.630]  so I told the dudes about the secondhand Samet shit
[02:29:03.630 --> 02:29:06.150]  and then JJ was like, Yeah, I had to use that
[02:29:06.150 --> 02:29:07.550]  before somebody else did.
[02:29:07.550 --> 02:29:09.070]  So I was like, Yeah, right on.
[02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:13.950]  So they'd probably have to have whatever he put that on.
[02:29:15.270 --> 02:29:16.630]  I don't know, man.
[02:29:16.670 --> 02:29:19.470]  That would have to be the mail, I would think.
[02:29:19.470 --> 02:29:21.470]  Yeah, it's to be continued.
[02:29:23.830 --> 02:29:24.870]  I don't know, man.
[02:29:27.870 --> 02:29:28.710]  It's a good one.
[02:29:28.710 --> 02:29:30.270]  Lots of choices.
[02:29:30.270 --> 02:29:32.030]  So many choices, man.
[02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:38.030]  But yeah, like I said, dude, Country Banner, Dick Soup,
[02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:39.670]  you're gonna have a good evening.
[02:29:41.710 --> 02:29:43.710]  Depends on who you are.
[02:29:43.710 --> 02:29:44.950]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:29:45.790 --> 02:29:48.990]  Oh, dude, they're both, you're gonna laugh, man.
[02:29:48.990 --> 02:29:51.710]  They're both hilarious, hilarious songs.
[02:29:51.710 --> 02:29:54.830]  Oh, we do see a request though
[02:29:54.830 --> 02:29:57.990]  for a little Thunderhole in the Dick Soup.
[02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.830]  You know what?
[02:29:58.830 --> 02:29:59.910]  Good call.
[02:29:59.910 --> 02:30:04.270]  Secondhand sandwich in the fucking Thunderhole.
[02:30:04.270 --> 02:30:05.150]  There we go.
[02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:07.310]  All right, Eric.
[02:30:07.310 --> 02:30:08.390]  Been said.
[02:30:09.430 --> 02:30:10.670]  It's been said.
[02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:11.710]  It was written.
[02:30:11.710 --> 02:30:13.550]  It's a fact.
[02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:14.870]  It's gonna happen now.
[02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:21.470]  Oh, Lord.
[02:30:21.470 --> 02:30:22.870]  Testers beware.
[02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:25.510]  Exactly.
[02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:27.630]  It better not grow golf ball nugs though, dude.
[02:30:27.630 --> 02:30:31.870]  You gotta get the baby arm on that.
[02:30:31.870 --> 02:30:33.590]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[02:30:33.590 --> 02:30:36.030]  Like if we can get one that the nodes don't alternate,
[02:30:36.030 --> 02:30:37.790]  you know, where you got like a nice cola
[02:30:37.790 --> 02:30:41.590]  and a nice set underneath, that'd be all right.
[02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:42.430]  Yeah.
[02:30:43.790 --> 02:30:45.350]  It's a rocket ship.
[02:30:45.350 --> 02:30:46.750]  That's another good movie.
[02:30:46.750 --> 02:30:48.630]  Fucking Death of Smoochie.
[02:30:48.630 --> 02:30:49.950]  Death of Smoochie.
[02:30:49.950 --> 02:30:51.230]  Death of Smoochie.
[02:30:51.230 --> 02:30:52.070]  Classical.
[02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:53.750]  It's not a rocket ship, it's a cock.
[02:30:55.390 --> 02:30:56.870]  Rainbow fucking rainbow.
[02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:58.710]  Oh, I wonder who this is.
[02:30:58.710 --> 02:31:01.790]  That's not a Hot Shots Part Two moment again.
[02:31:01.790 --> 02:31:03.870]  What movie is that?
[02:31:03.870 --> 02:31:04.990]  Naked Gun.
[02:31:04.990 --> 02:31:06.070]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:08.110]  Naked Gun, yes.
[02:31:08.110 --> 02:31:10.350]  Yeah, Leslie Nelson.
[02:31:10.350 --> 02:31:11.790]  Those are good movies too.
[02:31:12.790 --> 02:31:14.030]  Oh, yeah.
[02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:16.390]  Stoner, Stoner Entertainment, man.
[02:31:16.390 --> 02:31:17.350]  Oh, yeah.
[02:31:17.350 --> 02:31:18.430]  Somebody asked me, he was like,
[02:31:18.430 --> 02:31:21.110]  how do you know so much music, movies and shit?
[02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:23.430]  I was like, I couldn't have any friends.
[02:31:23.430 --> 02:31:25.790]  I was stuck in fucking grow houses and shit.
[02:31:25.790 --> 02:31:27.670]  And like, I can't go out after that.
[02:31:27.670 --> 02:31:30.990]  I'd get fucking arrested smelling how I'm smelling like.
[02:31:30.990 --> 02:31:34.150]  I had to stay to myself, so, yeah.
[02:31:34.150 --> 02:31:36.750]  Movie time, blockbuster, whatever.
[02:31:36.750 --> 02:31:38.070]  And, you know.
[02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:38.910]  Yeah.
[02:31:39.870 --> 02:31:41.750]  That was about as good as it got.
[02:31:41.750 --> 02:31:43.590]  Oh, shit.
[02:31:43.590 --> 02:31:46.230]  The days of dial up where it would take you 30 minutes
[02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:48.430]  to get a five minute song.
[02:31:48.430 --> 02:31:50.870]  Definitely not watching movies off of that.
[02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:52.710]  Definitely not, man.
[02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:54.270]  Definitely not.
[02:31:54.270 --> 02:31:56.670]  Like when the DVD came out and shit.
[02:31:56.670 --> 02:32:01.190]  Like, I had one of those fucking 12 disc DVD changers
[02:32:01.190 --> 02:32:02.030]  and stuff.
[02:32:02.030 --> 02:32:04.750]  Dude, it was awesome.
[02:32:04.750 --> 02:32:06.230]  Oh, yeah, it was good.
[02:32:06.470 --> 02:32:09.990]  Oh, they'd fucking big ass huge speakers
[02:32:09.990 --> 02:32:13.510]  that are now replaced by something like that big, you know.
[02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:15.910]  Shit.
[02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:18.150]  The bums. Technology.
[02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:21.670]  Yeah, just trying to tell the Unabomber about that shit, man.
[02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:23.230]  It's like, you know.
[02:32:24.150 --> 02:32:25.790]  That's- Technology has really
[02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:27.870]  kind of gotten awesome in certain ways.
[02:32:29.070 --> 02:32:32.550]  Yeah, but talking to Ted Kaczynski
[02:32:32.590 --> 02:32:36.990]  about fucking technology is probably a sore spot
[02:32:36.990 --> 02:32:38.270]  with the guy.
[02:32:38.270 --> 02:32:39.430]  Yeah, a little bit.
[02:32:39.430 --> 02:32:42.950]  He's got a little bit of a manifesto against these things.
[02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:44.350]  He wrote two books.
[02:32:44.350 --> 02:32:46.350]  Like he had written another one
[02:32:46.350 --> 02:32:49.230]  and he was working on writing the third one.
[02:32:49.230 --> 02:32:50.830]  I read his manifesto, man.
[02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:51.790]  Like- Yeah, yeah.
[02:32:51.790 --> 02:32:53.070]  It's pretty, pretty spot on.
[02:32:53.070 --> 02:32:54.470]  Interesting guy.
[02:32:54.470 --> 02:32:55.590]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:56.430]  For sure.
[02:32:56.430 --> 02:32:59.670]  He's a big environmentalist, you know.
[02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:01.470]  That was something like people didn't get.
[02:33:02.350 --> 02:33:07.350]  He was like really big about animals and animal rights
[02:33:07.430 --> 02:33:10.190]  and deforestation and all that shit, you know.
[02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:11.750]  I was kind of like his motive.
[02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:17.510]  Yeah, there was a lot of like logical stuff
[02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:22.150]  in his arguments that it kind of reminded me of,
[02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:25.190]  you know, everybody, you know, you hear of that like person.
[02:33:25.190 --> 02:33:27.230]  It's like, they're right on the border.
[02:33:27.230 --> 02:33:29.750]  It's like, are they a genius or are they crazy?
[02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:31.350]  Are they a genius or are they crazy?
[02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:33.110]  Because oftentimes those two things
[02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:34.990]  are very fricking close together.
[02:33:34.990 --> 02:33:35.950]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:33:35.950 --> 02:33:40.350]  He was hanging on by that, this thread, you know.
[02:33:40.350 --> 02:33:42.790]  And then that thread popped.
[02:33:42.790 --> 02:33:43.630]  Right.
[02:33:43.630 --> 02:33:45.150]  And then that's, you know, he cut loose
[02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:48.670]  and you know, he started fucking sending bombs
[02:33:48.670 --> 02:33:50.590]  out in the mail, you know.
[02:33:50.590 --> 02:33:51.430]  Yeah.
[02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:56.670]  But you know, to think like, had he written that,
[02:33:56.670 --> 02:34:00.590]  not bombed anything, nobody would really know what it was.
[02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:04.750]  But he could have waited, what, like 30 years
[02:34:04.750 --> 02:34:07.230]  or something, you know, and then like be pushing it hard.
[02:34:07.230 --> 02:34:09.430]  But then again, it'd be fucked up
[02:34:09.430 --> 02:34:12.590]  because he'd be using technology to push it.
[02:34:12.590 --> 02:34:15.070]  It's kind of like a weird double-edged sword
[02:34:15.070 --> 02:34:16.790]  with the whole thing, if you think about it.
[02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:21.790]  But he ended up, he finally lost his shit, like totally.
[02:34:22.190 --> 02:34:24.190]  And was like injuring himself.
[02:34:24.190 --> 02:34:26.790]  He like broke a leg, broke an arm.
[02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:30.350]  That's those are serious things to do too.
[02:34:31.110 --> 02:34:32.710]  That's not fucking cutting yourself.
[02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:33.630]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:34:33.630 --> 02:34:34.670]  That hurts.
[02:34:34.670 --> 02:34:38.190]  Yeah, they finally, they turned him loose out of Florence
[02:34:38.190 --> 02:34:40.790]  and they shipped him to Butner on the East Coast
[02:34:40.790 --> 02:34:42.230]  in North Carolina.
[02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:44.510]  It's a medical facility, so.
[02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:45.350]  Okay.
[02:34:45.350 --> 02:34:47.150]  Yeah, pretty wild, man.
[02:34:48.470 --> 02:34:52.230]  Yeah, man, that's an interesting person
[02:34:52.230 --> 02:34:54.710]  to have been in their orbit.
[02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:57.430]  Yeah, could you imagine like living in a bathroom
[02:34:57.430 --> 02:35:00.350]  for like, let's see here, what is the sentence?
[02:35:00.350 --> 02:35:02.670]  In like 96, 97.
[02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:04.190]  Wow.
[02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:05.630]  30 years basically.
[02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:08.030]  Yeah, 30 years living in your bathroom.
[02:35:09.950 --> 02:35:11.630]  Like fuck, man.
[02:35:11.630 --> 02:35:14.630]  I think I would have lost my shit before then.
[02:35:14.630 --> 02:35:19.630]  Yeah, yeah, that's a whole fucking big conversation
[02:35:20.270 --> 02:35:21.510]  that could be had.
[02:35:21.510 --> 02:35:23.270]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:35:23.270 --> 02:35:25.390]  I am so fucking lukewarm.
[02:35:25.390 --> 02:35:26.550]  Yeah.
[02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:30.150]  So when is your collaboration with Burner coming out?
[02:35:30.150 --> 02:35:31.310]  Never.
[02:35:31.310 --> 02:35:32.150]  No.
[02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:33.070]  Never, ever, ever.
[02:35:33.070 --> 02:35:35.670]  Never, ever, ever, ever, ever.
[02:35:35.670 --> 02:35:36.510]  Nah, bro.
[02:35:36.510 --> 02:35:37.350]  Ever.
[02:35:37.350 --> 02:35:39.590]  I ain't about that life, dude.
[02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:40.630]  Okay.
[02:35:40.630 --> 02:35:42.710]  Duke's cookies.
[02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:46.630]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's across the fucking dick soup
[02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:47.910]  and big bud.
[02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:49.790]  Call it Dukeys.
[02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:50.630]  There you go.
[02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:51.910]  There you go.
[02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:53.110]  Dukeys.
[02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:54.830]  Yeah, man.
[02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:59.270]  Yeah, yeah, fucking do my own thing, man.
[02:35:59.270 --> 02:36:01.830]  Fucking, he's got his own ways, you know.
[02:36:01.830 --> 02:36:03.630]  He can do his thing.
[02:36:03.630 --> 02:36:04.470]  Yeah.
[02:36:04.470 --> 02:36:05.310]  I'm gonna do me.
[02:36:05.310 --> 02:36:06.150]  Yeah.
[02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:06.990]  Yeah, there's room.
[02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:09.150]  There's room for everybody, but yeah.
[02:36:12.310 --> 02:36:13.310]  Dog Days Garden.
[02:36:13.310 --> 02:36:15.350]  He's a big fan of yours.
[02:36:15.350 --> 02:36:17.190]  He's picked up a lot of your gear too,
[02:36:17.190 --> 02:36:20.070]  but hashtag no cookies in my garden.
[02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:23.510]  Yeah, that still remains true, man.
[02:36:23.510 --> 02:36:24.350]  Yeah, me too.
[02:36:24.350 --> 02:36:25.190]  That still remains true.
[02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:26.270]  I try to keep it out.
[02:36:27.190 --> 02:36:28.030]  Dave.
[02:36:28.030 --> 02:36:30.590]  Yeah, this is not really my jam, you know.
[02:36:30.590 --> 02:36:31.470]  It's pretty weird.
[02:36:31.470 --> 02:36:32.870]  Smells real good.
[02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:34.070]  Tastes good too.
[02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:37.390]  Just doesn't have that oomph, you know.
[02:36:37.390 --> 02:36:40.870]  I've had like a couple of hybrids of it though
[02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:43.990]  that were like, I considered like real good.
[02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:49.790]  IC Collective, they had the ChemScout.
[02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:52.230]  That was actually pretty good,
[02:36:52.230 --> 02:36:54.830]  but you know, it's chem, you know, it was in it.
[02:36:54.830 --> 02:36:58.990]  That's, that brought the potency.
[02:36:58.990 --> 02:36:59.990]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:36:59.990 --> 02:37:02.230]  That wasn't too bad, you know.
[02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:04.110]  It's like I said, it's been a couple of them,
[02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:09.110]  but yeah, more often times than not, it was like, you know.
[02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:15.630]  Yeah, it's been a pretty bland profile for me.
[02:37:15.630 --> 02:37:18.910]  So I've not been a big fan of it personally,
[02:37:18.910 --> 02:37:21.470]  but I understand, you know, looks great,
[02:37:21.470 --> 02:37:23.830]  washes great, smells great, stuff like that.
[02:37:23.830 --> 02:37:26.870]  But yeah, everybody's got their own cup of tea.
[02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:28.110]  Yeah, make you some money.
[02:37:28.110 --> 02:37:29.590]  And you know, there are people out there
[02:37:29.590 --> 02:37:31.510]  that don't like to get real high, you know.
[02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:34.430]  So that's cool too.
[02:37:35.870 --> 02:37:37.310]  We call them soccer moms.
[02:37:37.310 --> 02:37:38.350]  No, I'm just joking.
[02:37:38.350 --> 02:37:43.350]  I'm a person who, I like my 18, 20% sometimes too.
[02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:45.430]  A question here, Purple Thumb says,
[02:37:45.470 --> 02:37:49.590]  what else does Duke have in the bag that's not his?
[02:37:49.590 --> 02:37:54.590]  Yeah, see he was on to, or maybe not he, maybe she,
[02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:56.230]  I don't know.
[02:37:56.230 --> 02:37:57.430]  It's a he.
[02:37:57.430 --> 02:37:58.270]  Purple Thumb.
[02:37:58.270 --> 02:37:59.670]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:37:59.670 --> 02:38:00.990]  This is true.
[02:38:00.990 --> 02:38:02.870]  We've had conversations before.
[02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:06.030]  I appreciate your sensitivity to the situation.
[02:38:06.030 --> 02:38:07.070]  I try, I try.
[02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:10.990]  Like despite being like how I am, I still, I do,
[02:38:10.990 --> 02:38:15.230]  I do try to, you know, not offend people too much.
[02:38:16.190 --> 02:38:18.230]  So yeah, I was trying to like, you know,
[02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:20.190]  go through like more things that I have
[02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:25.190]  that are not my stuff that like I was into growing,
[02:38:25.590 --> 02:38:28.870]  you know, because I kind of figured that would be,
[02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:30.110]  it'd be like more cool.
[02:38:30.110 --> 02:38:31.510]  Because like, yeah, of course, you know,
[02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:33.830]  I grew up on my own shit, but you know,
[02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:36.990]  I figured people might dig to see like what else,
[02:38:36.990 --> 02:38:40.190]  you know, I like to get into.
[02:38:40.190 --> 02:38:43.430]  There's a couple Swamp Boy, Swamp Boy facts up in there.
[02:38:44.270 --> 02:38:47.910]  There's a couple of things from Top Dog, JJ in there.
[02:38:49.270 --> 02:38:51.790]  And there's a couple of things from Bob Hemphill
[02:38:51.790 --> 02:38:53.470]  that are in there too.
[02:38:53.470 --> 02:38:55.630]  Crickets and cicadas.
[02:38:55.630 --> 02:38:57.550]  That's right, that's right.
[02:38:57.550 --> 02:38:58.390]  Yes.
[02:39:00.110 --> 02:39:01.030]  Good stuff there.
[02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:04.510]  Oh, Dave, Dave flips over the card.
[02:39:04.510 --> 02:39:08.950]  He'd be another really good dude to have on here.
[02:39:08.950 --> 02:39:09.910]  Oh, that would be fun.
[02:39:09.910 --> 02:39:10.750]  Yeah.
[02:39:10.750 --> 02:39:11.830]  That would be awesome.
[02:39:11.870 --> 02:39:14.270]  He does a lot of preservation stuff.
[02:39:14.270 --> 02:39:15.110]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:15.110 --> 02:39:17.790]  And he's got like all types of like,
[02:39:17.790 --> 02:39:19.750]  you know, off the wall type shit too.
[02:39:23.110 --> 02:39:23.950]  Yeah.
[02:39:23.950 --> 02:39:26.670]  And people, you know, people like he's saying here is,
[02:39:26.670 --> 02:39:28.630]  you know, people like to see what we have stashed away
[02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:30.110]  and we kind of touched on it earlier.
[02:39:30.110 --> 02:39:32.750]  It's like, you know, what is your favorite grower growing?
[02:39:32.750 --> 02:39:34.310]  Or like, who is your favorite breeder
[02:39:34.310 --> 02:39:36.230]  excited to pick up beans from?
[02:39:38.070 --> 02:39:39.910]  So those are the fun things.
[02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:41.990]  Cause that, you know, that leads us onto the next one.
[02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:43.510]  That's how we can keep exploring
[02:39:43.510 --> 02:39:46.070]  and expanding kind of our circle.
[02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:47.910]  Cause again, it's, you're right.
[02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:50.470]  There are, there's so many choices out there that
[02:39:52.230 --> 02:39:54.070]  to get, to really get dialed in
[02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:56.310]  and good seeds do make a difference.
[02:39:56.310 --> 02:39:58.630]  Like most of us start out growing bag seeds
[02:39:58.630 --> 02:40:00.390]  and we get some good stuff.
[02:40:00.390 --> 02:40:02.950]  But then once you really kind of step it up to, you know,
[02:40:02.950 --> 02:40:07.230]  again, I always say that JC2 is like my first pro clone
[02:40:07.230 --> 02:40:09.510]  that made me really realize the difference
[02:40:09.510 --> 02:40:11.950]  between something that's been worked
[02:40:12.790 --> 02:40:14.990]  and even at that point had been selected.
[02:40:14.990 --> 02:40:18.590]  Cause this, this dispensary, they did the selecting for me.
[02:40:18.590 --> 02:40:20.830]  They went through, you know, they did the fetal hunt
[02:40:20.830 --> 02:40:23.230]  and they just had this prize clone that they would put out.
[02:40:23.230 --> 02:40:27.350]  So those efforts, man, they make a big difference.
[02:40:27.350 --> 02:40:29.070]  Yeah. And it's all about the hunt too.
[02:40:29.070 --> 02:40:31.630]  You know, like this is no telling what,
[02:40:31.630 --> 02:40:34.030]  what you might find, you know?
[02:40:34.030 --> 02:40:36.350]  And I've always been a real lucky fucker too.
[02:40:36.350 --> 02:40:38.230]  Like somebody, you know,
[02:40:38.230 --> 02:40:41.230]  like you'll give me some Nakatami plazas
[02:40:41.550 --> 02:40:45.950]  and I'll pop three of them and find like the best shit
[02:40:45.950 --> 02:40:47.550]  that you'll find and everything.
[02:40:47.550 --> 02:40:50.270]  It just, it's always like that for some reason.
[02:40:50.270 --> 02:40:52.630]  So yeah, man.
[02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:57.630]  And it's like, I can only do so much work on my own
[02:40:58.670 --> 02:41:00.750]  and there's so much other cool shit out there
[02:41:00.750 --> 02:41:02.030]  that other people are doing.
[02:41:02.030 --> 02:41:05.270]  And it's like, that's not even like my realm,
[02:41:05.270 --> 02:41:07.670]  but I'm really, really into the weed.
[02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:09.950]  Like I said, like I grow other people's shit
[02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:12.190]  and like I have no intent on breeding with it
[02:41:12.190 --> 02:41:13.030]  or anything like that.
[02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:15.550]  It's just, end of the day, I'm a grower too.
[02:41:15.550 --> 02:41:19.670]  And I like to smoke weed and you know, I like that shit.
[02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:20.710]  So, and it's cool.
[02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:23.430]  Cause then I didn't have to do all the work on it for years,
[02:41:23.430 --> 02:41:26.670]  you know, and I just get to pop this seed and enjoy it,
[02:41:26.670 --> 02:41:28.230]  you know, so it's pretty rad.
[02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:31.550]  That's true.
[02:41:31.550 --> 02:41:35.430]  You know, you don't have to put fricking pollen
[02:41:35.430 --> 02:41:37.190]  on everything that you grow.
[02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:40.790]  Like that's actually should not be what you do.
[02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:43.710]  Save that, reserve that for the special ones you love
[02:41:43.710 --> 02:41:48.270]  and understand, but you know, there is a tendency to,
[02:41:48.270 --> 02:41:49.510]  oh, I've got this now.
[02:41:49.510 --> 02:41:51.350]  Oh, I gotta put pollen on it.
[02:41:51.350 --> 02:41:52.190]  So.
[02:41:52.190 --> 02:41:53.030]  Gotta make a habit, bro.
[02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:54.470]  Gotta make a habit.
[02:41:54.470 --> 02:41:55.950]  Yeah, well.
[02:41:55.950 --> 02:41:56.790]  Say, babu.
[02:42:00.230 --> 02:42:01.790]  Remember that song, dude?
[02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:02.870]  No.
[02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:04.070]  You don't remember that, man?
[02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:05.510]  That was a good jam, dude.
[02:42:07.310 --> 02:42:08.830]  Man, you ain't got a wild man.
[02:42:08.830 --> 02:42:11.270]  I know you know you gotta be a champ.
[02:42:11.270 --> 02:42:12.110]  He's got me.
[02:42:12.990 --> 02:42:14.910]  He's like, bro, come on, you know that shit.
[02:42:14.910 --> 02:42:15.750]  You know that shit.
[02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:17.750]  See that girl.
[02:42:17.750 --> 02:42:19.350]  Watch that scene.
[02:42:19.350 --> 02:42:21.710]  Digging the Herman Queen.
[02:42:25.310 --> 02:42:26.510]  Oh yeah.
[02:42:26.510 --> 02:42:27.790]  Joe Dirtay.
[02:42:27.790 --> 02:42:30.150]  That's all I can think of, Joe Dirtay.
[02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:32.670]  Little chatty church it up, son.
[02:42:32.670 --> 02:42:33.710]  She mean dirt.
[02:42:34.590 --> 02:42:35.430]  Sean B.F.
[02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:40.150]  Yeah, we calling you Jenny.
[02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:42.990]  Eric.
[02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:44.830]  Oh, man.
[02:42:48.110 --> 02:42:48.950]  Sorry.
[02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:51.190]  I'm getting horsey.
[02:42:51.190 --> 02:42:52.670]  Oh, you're cool, man.
[02:42:52.670 --> 02:42:53.750]  Dancing queen.
[02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:55.750]  Yeah.
[02:42:55.750 --> 02:42:58.310]  So what else have we not hit?
[02:42:59.670 --> 02:43:00.750]  Seeds.
[02:43:00.750 --> 02:43:01.590]  Seeds.
[02:43:02.470 --> 02:43:04.150]  Is this a seed show?
[02:43:07.910 --> 02:43:09.150]  Yeah, could be.
[02:43:10.630 --> 02:43:11.470]  Oh God.
[02:43:15.470 --> 02:43:16.550]  Are you in?
[02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:17.390]  You're in?
[02:43:22.350 --> 02:43:23.950]  Yeah, seeds.
[02:43:25.230 --> 02:43:26.390]  Yeah.
[02:43:26.390 --> 02:43:27.470]  All right.
[02:43:27.510 --> 02:43:32.510]  Well, I should probably, probably wrap it up then.
[02:43:32.670 --> 02:43:34.310]  I mean, I'll grab another beer.
[02:43:34.310 --> 02:43:36.510]  Like, I don't give a fuck.
[02:43:36.510 --> 02:43:37.950]  I can keep grabbing my shoes.
[02:43:38.830 --> 02:43:39.870]  I don't give a shit.
[02:43:41.470 --> 02:43:43.270]  Dave, what you got?
[02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:47.550]  Oh, I was in the middle of hitting a phone.
[02:43:47.550 --> 02:43:49.470]  Oh, I just ruined that there.
[02:43:49.470 --> 02:43:51.110]  All right, I'm gonna dig back into,
[02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:51.950]  I'm gonna dig back into you.
[02:43:51.950 --> 02:43:53.030]  Was there any seeds in it?
[02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:54.990]  Was there any seeds in it?
[02:43:54.990 --> 02:43:56.590]  Did you get that funny smell?
[02:43:56.590 --> 02:43:58.990]  Did you get the pop, the little firecracker?
[02:43:58.990 --> 02:44:00.550]  Let's talk about those seeds.
[02:44:00.550 --> 02:44:03.030]  The ones you didn't realize were there.
[02:44:03.030 --> 02:44:04.830]  That's the fucking worst.
[02:44:04.830 --> 02:44:06.310]  Secret seeds.
[02:44:06.310 --> 02:44:08.670]  The worst flavor, could be,
[02:44:08.670 --> 02:44:09.590]  cause you know what?
[02:44:09.590 --> 02:44:11.190]  That's the fucking winner too.
[02:44:11.190 --> 02:44:13.470]  That's gonna be the best weed that's ever been grown
[02:44:13.470 --> 02:44:14.750]  and you just smoked it.
[02:44:14.750 --> 02:44:19.470]  Yeah, you literally just fucking smoked the newcomer dog.
[02:44:19.470 --> 02:44:20.310]  Yep.
[02:44:20.310 --> 02:44:21.270]  Just fucking smoked.
[02:44:21.270 --> 02:44:22.430]  Secret seeds.
[02:44:22.430 --> 02:44:23.270]  The,
[02:44:30.030 --> 02:44:30.950]  Chemdog that I hear.
[02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:33.830]  So I have one from Skunk VA, the Lucky Dog Seed Co.
[02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:35.750]  It's actually called Twin Peaks.
[02:44:36.910 --> 02:44:40.070]  Chemdog 91 BX2 x Chem Sister.
[02:44:42.190 --> 02:44:44.670]  That one's pretty good.
[02:44:44.670 --> 02:44:46.710]  I only popped a couple.
[02:44:46.710 --> 02:44:49.190]  Discontinuing it on this next run.
[02:44:49.190 --> 02:44:50.430]  I'll probably go back to it
[02:44:50.430 --> 02:44:52.990]  cause I liked it, it had potential.
[02:44:52.990 --> 02:44:57.070]  But I would love if it had just a little bit more gas on it.
[02:44:59.030 --> 02:45:00.510]  And it might be in there.
[02:45:00.510 --> 02:45:02.510]  Where's your thoughts on this?
[02:45:02.510 --> 02:45:05.590]  So this comes up a lot.
[02:45:05.590 --> 02:45:07.150]  So we're talking about seeds.
[02:45:08.030 --> 02:45:09.630]  Seeds.
[02:45:09.630 --> 02:45:12.950]  S-E-E-D-S-Z.
[02:45:12.950 --> 02:45:14.070]  Seeds.
[02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.910]  Seeds.
[02:45:15.870 --> 02:45:16.710]  So,
[02:45:20.310 --> 02:45:22.150]  popping seeds, right?
[02:45:22.150 --> 02:45:25.470]  When you get a pack, do you pop the whole pack?
[02:45:26.710 --> 02:45:28.430]  You know what I mean?
[02:45:28.430 --> 02:45:30.470]  I always keep at least two.
[02:45:30.470 --> 02:45:31.470]  Okay.
[02:45:31.470 --> 02:45:34.030]  So this is something like I used to fuck up on
[02:45:34.030 --> 02:45:35.510]  back in the day.
[02:45:35.510 --> 02:45:38.310]  I'd pop, I'd get like some new shit, right?
[02:45:38.310 --> 02:45:40.870]  I'd pop like three or four of this, three or four of that.
[02:45:40.870 --> 02:45:42.790]  And then in about a time, males,
[02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:46.870]  sometimes you're like, oh fuck, four seeds, four males.
[02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:49.150]  And then two of this, one of this,
[02:45:49.150 --> 02:45:51.830]  you don't really get to like,
[02:45:52.990 --> 02:45:54.310]  really get in there.
[02:45:54.310 --> 02:45:55.310]  You know what I mean?
[02:45:55.310 --> 02:45:57.270]  And you might be deterred.
[02:45:57.270 --> 02:45:59.670]  You might have that one female and it just wasn't it,
[02:45:59.670 --> 02:46:03.110]  and then it's like it deters you from the rest.
[02:46:03.110 --> 02:46:07.710]  So that, and we had friends,
[02:46:07.710 --> 02:46:10.030]  everybody's kinda like popping and growing the same shit
[02:46:10.030 --> 02:46:12.030]  and they got this awesome one.
[02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:14.310]  Or they find like one that's kinda like,
[02:46:14.310 --> 02:46:17.430]  kinda swaggy, but I found like the best shit ever.
[02:46:17.430 --> 02:46:20.590]  So we decided then and there, it's like, yeah,
[02:46:20.590 --> 02:46:23.310]  one pack minimum, the whole fucking thing.
[02:46:23.310 --> 02:46:24.550]  You know what I mean?
[02:46:24.550 --> 02:46:27.230]  And if it's something that you feel like,
[02:46:27.230 --> 02:46:30.510]  you know, you might need more later, buy two packs.
[02:46:30.510 --> 02:46:31.350]  You know?
[02:46:31.350 --> 02:46:32.630]  And then some shit that we knew
[02:46:32.630 --> 02:46:34.390]  was kinda getting good results,
[02:46:34.390 --> 02:46:37.670]  we'd buy four, five packs, pop them all.
[02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:39.950]  You know, that's how you really got that.
[02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.870]  You know.
[02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:44.150]  Are you cloning them individually
[02:46:44.150 --> 02:46:45.670]  before you put them in the flower?
[02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:50.310]  So you're keeping backups of everything before you go in?
[02:46:50.310 --> 02:46:51.550]  True grit, bro.
[02:46:51.550 --> 02:46:52.670]  That's where, like I said,
[02:46:52.670 --> 02:46:54.110]  you're sleeping in your living room,
[02:46:54.110 --> 02:46:55.710]  wherever the front door is.
[02:46:55.710 --> 02:46:57.670]  The rest of the house is a grow.
[02:46:57.670 --> 02:46:58.590]  Yes.
[02:46:58.590 --> 02:47:00.430]  You have the one dedicated toilet.
[02:47:00.430 --> 02:47:02.790]  They might have some clones on the top of the bowl.
[02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:03.830]  The reservoir.
[02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:05.430]  Plants in the shower.
[02:47:05.430 --> 02:47:06.870]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:06.870 --> 02:47:07.790]  Exactly.
[02:47:07.790 --> 02:47:10.830]  Use the little bar to hang a T5 from.
[02:47:10.870 --> 02:47:12.070]  Oh man.
[02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:14.150]  Yeah, true grit, bud.
[02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:15.990]  That's how you get the good shit.
[02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:17.550]  Mm-hmm.
[02:47:17.550 --> 02:47:18.390]  Yeah.
[02:47:18.390 --> 02:47:19.550]  Sacrifice, man.
[02:47:19.550 --> 02:47:20.390]  Yeah.
[02:47:20.390 --> 02:47:22.870]  And if it's illegal, even better.
[02:47:22.870 --> 02:47:25.190]  You know, like the little seeds, they know it.
[02:47:25.190 --> 02:47:26.430]  Living on the edge.
[02:47:26.430 --> 02:47:28.390]  Living adventurously.
[02:47:28.390 --> 02:47:30.190]  So they get off on that shit too.
[02:47:30.190 --> 02:47:31.470]  So, right.
[02:47:31.470 --> 02:47:34.150]  Oh, they love their press conferences.
[02:47:34.150 --> 02:47:36.350]  With their little shit laid out on the table
[02:47:36.350 --> 02:47:38.750]  and everybody behind it standing like this.
[02:47:38.750 --> 02:47:39.590]  Oh yeah.
[02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:41.670]  Oh yeah, they love that shit, dude.
[02:47:41.670 --> 02:47:42.990]  They live for it.
[02:47:42.990 --> 02:47:44.710]  Good photo op.
[02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:45.550]  Uh-huh.
[02:47:46.470 --> 02:47:48.070]  Oh yeah, do it up, man.
[02:47:49.070 --> 02:47:50.870]  I love it when those,
[02:47:50.870 --> 02:47:53.150]  cause those are popular and they get posted on Facebook
[02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:54.590]  or you know, whatever these days
[02:47:54.590 --> 02:47:57.510]  under, you know, San Antonio Police Department.
[02:47:57.510 --> 02:48:00.110]  And they're always, dude, they always get fucking memed.
[02:48:00.110 --> 02:48:01.990]  They always get ripped so hard.
[02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:02.830]  It's hilarious.
[02:48:02.830 --> 02:48:05.110]  It's like, I saw one the other day
[02:48:05.110 --> 02:48:06.110]  and it was just like, you know,
[02:48:06.110 --> 02:48:08.470]  they had like the stack of money.
[02:48:08.510 --> 02:48:10.110]  You know how they usually like lay the money out
[02:48:10.110 --> 02:48:11.430]  in front of everything else.
[02:48:11.430 --> 02:48:14.550]  It was like single layered like money.
[02:48:14.550 --> 02:48:15.990]  It's like not even stacks, dude.
[02:48:15.990 --> 02:48:17.390]  It's like, you put a little stack in the middle
[02:48:17.390 --> 02:48:19.630]  and then you just like single layered everything out.
[02:48:19.630 --> 02:48:20.750]  Cause it was like, what'd you get?
[02:48:20.750 --> 02:48:22.310]  Like their allowance?
[02:48:22.310 --> 02:48:23.150]  The fuck?
[02:48:23.150 --> 02:48:24.630]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:48:24.630 --> 02:48:26.630]  It's singles underneath each one.
[02:48:26.630 --> 02:48:27.910]  It's fucking Jackass.
[02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:29.150]  They got me back in the day.
[02:48:29.150 --> 02:48:30.510]  We're talking about a million dollars
[02:48:30.510 --> 02:48:32.430]  buried in the backyard.
[02:48:32.430 --> 02:48:34.150]  And I'm fucking, yeah.
[02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:38.230]  And them assholes out there fucking pick axes and shovels.
[02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:39.830]  And they were like,
[02:48:39.830 --> 02:48:42.830]  digging in the backyard on the spot that I pointed them to.
[02:48:42.830 --> 02:48:45.470]  So I could like keep smoking cigarettes
[02:48:45.470 --> 02:48:46.710]  and watching the sun come up.
[02:48:46.710 --> 02:48:49.590]  Cause I knew it'd be a while before I seen that sun again.
[02:48:49.590 --> 02:48:50.430]  So yeah.
[02:48:51.830 --> 02:48:54.270]  Yeah, had them fucking all huffing and puffing
[02:48:54.270 --> 02:48:56.950]  a bunch of fat motherfuckers and shit.
[02:48:56.950 --> 02:48:58.950]  Ruined their fucking morning.
[02:48:58.950 --> 02:49:01.150]  And then they were like all pissed off
[02:49:01.150 --> 02:49:02.110]  cause it wasn't there.
[02:49:02.110 --> 02:49:04.630]  So I did the all, you know,
[02:49:04.630 --> 02:49:07.990]  I started pacing and shit, lining myself up with a tree.
[02:49:08.750 --> 02:49:09.590]  They walked into the next spot.
[02:49:09.590 --> 02:49:10.430]  They started digging.
[02:49:10.430 --> 02:49:11.430]  They hit the ping ping.
[02:49:11.430 --> 02:49:13.030]  And they're like, oh yeah, we got it.
[02:49:13.030 --> 02:49:14.270]  And they're all fucking happy.
[02:49:14.270 --> 02:49:15.110]  They crack at it.
[02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:16.510]  And it was my septic tank.
[02:49:16.510 --> 02:49:17.350]  Nice.
[02:49:17.350 --> 02:49:19.030]  Motherfuckers are puking and shit.
[02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:20.790]  They take at you pieces of shit.
[02:49:20.790 --> 02:49:21.630]  Fuck you.
[02:49:22.590 --> 02:49:25.070]  I got beat up a little bit for that one.
[02:49:25.070 --> 02:49:27.350]  But sometimes I want to have extra tight.
[02:49:28.350 --> 02:49:29.750]  But I finished my last cigarette.
[02:49:29.750 --> 02:49:31.350]  I didn't give a fuck at that point.
[02:49:31.350 --> 02:49:33.230]  They take me to jail, you know.
[02:49:33.230 --> 02:49:34.350]  Fuck you.
[02:49:34.350 --> 02:49:35.910]  Smiling through the blood.
[02:49:36.430 --> 02:49:37.870]  Uh huh.
[02:49:37.870 --> 02:49:39.190]  You just spit it in their face.
[02:49:39.190 --> 02:49:41.750]  Cause you know, they can't do nothing about it
[02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:43.310]  except whip your ass some more.
[02:49:43.310 --> 02:49:44.550]  You know what I mean?
[02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:45.710]  Right.
[02:49:45.710 --> 02:49:47.830]  And they're like always like real hesitant too.
[02:49:47.830 --> 02:49:50.950]  So they're kind of like half hitting you and shit.
[02:49:50.950 --> 02:49:52.630]  You know, type of shit anyway.
[02:49:52.630 --> 02:49:54.470]  Cause they're fucking pussies.
[02:49:54.470 --> 02:49:56.510]  Can't leave a mark, man.
[02:49:56.510 --> 02:49:58.150]  Oh, they definitely leave some marks.
[02:49:58.150 --> 02:50:00.150]  But you spit blood back in their face.
[02:50:00.150 --> 02:50:02.270]  You know, they can't really say it, like report it.
[02:50:02.270 --> 02:50:05.030]  They're like, all right, why has he got blood he's spitting?
[02:50:06.030 --> 02:50:07.470]  Right. Yeah.
[02:50:07.470 --> 02:50:10.150]  It's like the bootlegger earlier.
[02:50:10.150 --> 02:50:12.430]  It's like, what are you going to do, report me?
[02:50:13.950 --> 02:50:14.790]  Like really?
[02:50:14.790 --> 02:50:15.750]  Exactly.
[02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:17.430]  What are you going to do?
[02:50:17.430 --> 02:50:21.630]  So like what the pop in the whole pack's going back to it.
[02:50:21.630 --> 02:50:24.590]  Like, you know, it's going to be the quality
[02:50:24.590 --> 02:50:26.910]  ultimately at the end anyway.
[02:50:26.910 --> 02:50:28.430]  Bloom them small.
[02:50:28.430 --> 02:50:29.510]  You know what I mean?
[02:50:30.870 --> 02:50:32.510]  Or like, you know, grow them out.
[02:50:32.510 --> 02:50:34.430]  Like it takes longer to do it this way.
[02:50:34.430 --> 02:50:38.510]  But grow them out, take the clones, bloom one, keep one.
[02:50:38.870 --> 02:50:39.390]  You know what I mean?
[02:50:39.390 --> 02:50:44.630]  Kill off the plant that you, you know, pop from seed and bloom those out.
[02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:46.750]  And then, you know, bloom them real small.
[02:50:47.070 --> 02:50:49.830]  You're going to get an idea on the terapine profile.
[02:50:49.830 --> 02:50:50.950]  You're going to be able to smoke it.
[02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:54.350]  You're going to be able to like, yeah, number 14 or, you know,
[02:50:54.350 --> 02:50:55.550]  however many you're popping.
[02:50:55.550 --> 02:50:58.110]  That was one or maybe there's like two or three.
[02:50:58.550 --> 02:51:00.950]  And then you grow them all to scale.
[02:51:01.510 --> 02:51:03.390]  And then you can really like get nitpicky.
[02:51:03.390 --> 02:51:06.750]  You'd be like, well, this one, you know, the branching on it's a lot better.
[02:51:06.750 --> 02:51:07.510]  It yields more.
[02:51:07.510 --> 02:51:11.390]  Plus it's super loud and potent versus this other one, you know.
[02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.910]  Yeah.
[02:51:13.030 --> 02:51:14.270]  And then you can really refine it.
[02:51:14.670 --> 02:51:17.510]  Cause, cause that's something that you will miss out on.
[02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:20.030]  If you are doing them like super short is you'll kind of, you'll
[02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:21.350]  lose out in the morphology.
[02:51:21.350 --> 02:51:25.630]  You'll get a general sense of, you know, nodal spacing and stretch.
[02:51:25.870 --> 02:51:31.230]  But I mean, really commercial scale, you're not getting that, but that
[02:51:31.230 --> 02:51:35.230]  kind of almost makes sense if the terpene profile is really unaffected,
[02:51:35.230 --> 02:51:41.550]  whether it's big or little, then that's just, that's smart because it's, it's
[02:51:41.550 --> 02:51:45.310]  kind of cutting one step out or speeding one of those steps up.
[02:51:45.350 --> 02:51:46.110]  Exactly.
[02:51:46.110 --> 02:51:49.230]  And just to remember this, like people have been growing OG
[02:51:49.230 --> 02:51:50.950]  Kush since the fucking nineties.
[02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:51.830]  Yeah.
[02:51:51.830 --> 02:51:52.670]  Still around.
[02:51:53.030 --> 02:51:57.110]  That's one of the most shitty fucking structured plants that there is, you
[02:51:57.110 --> 02:52:03.470]  know, flimsy branching, it's crazy, nodal spacing and all that, but the buds so bomb,
[02:52:03.790 --> 02:52:08.950]  you know, so, you know, so at least, you know, you get right to the point on like,
[02:52:09.470 --> 02:52:11.150]  does it pass the smoke test?
[02:52:11.150 --> 02:52:15.510]  And if it does, then you go into the structure and, you know, then you decide
[02:52:15.510 --> 02:52:17.550]  like, Hey, can I live with this or not?
[02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:18.310]  You know?
[02:52:18.350 --> 02:52:21.910]  And if it's that bomb, you'll, you'll find like, yeah, you can live with it.
[02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:23.310]  Right.
[02:52:23.310 --> 02:52:23.750]  Right.
[02:52:23.830 --> 02:52:25.030]  You'll, you'll work around it.
[02:52:25.350 --> 02:52:25.830]  Oh yeah.
[02:52:26.390 --> 02:52:26.710]  Yeah.
[02:52:27.550 --> 02:52:27.750]  Yeah.
[02:52:28.550 --> 02:52:29.390]  That's, that's good.
[02:52:29.430 --> 02:52:29.990]  That's good.
[02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:31.830]  And has practical application too.
[02:52:31.830 --> 02:52:36.670]  Cause the, the, you know, the Nakatomi plazas, the Nakatami plazas here,
[02:52:37.390 --> 02:52:40.030]  Nakatami plazas, copyright.
[02:52:40.470 --> 02:52:41.150]  Uh,
[02:52:41.430 --> 02:52:41.990]  trademark.
[02:52:42.270 --> 02:52:42.750]  Freaking bad.
[02:52:42.750 --> 02:52:43.230]  Yeah.
[02:52:43.670 --> 02:52:44.470]  Hashtag.
[02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:49.470]  Um, I was going to just kind of one and done them, but I'm actually thinking I'm
[02:52:49.470 --> 02:52:55.350]  like, well, maybe, you know, if there is something spectacular in it, I'll keep it.
[02:52:55.350 --> 02:52:58.910]  Cause I still have the ability to back cross or out cross.
[02:52:59.430 --> 02:52:59.790]  Uh,
[02:52:59.830 --> 02:53:00.470]  that's the thing.
[02:53:00.470 --> 02:53:05.190]  Like, obviously like it was important enough to you to make in general.
[02:53:05.190 --> 02:53:05.590]  Right.
[02:53:05.670 --> 02:53:06.110]  Yeah.
[02:53:06.590 --> 02:53:13.150]  And if it needed or exceeded, then yeah, keep it, keep it moving and keep improving,
[02:53:13.310 --> 02:53:18.030]  you know, and then every Christmas, you know, we got something to look forward to.
[02:53:18.790 --> 02:53:19.110]  Yeah.
[02:53:19.470 --> 02:53:20.470]  That would be rad.
[02:53:21.150 --> 02:53:22.910]  Nakatami harder.
[02:53:25.510 --> 02:53:28.310]  Oh, live, live free or die hard.
[02:53:28.310 --> 02:53:29.910]  Nakatami plazas.
[02:53:31.190 --> 02:53:31.990]  Exactly.
[02:53:32.390 --> 02:53:36.590]  I've got, I've got the next at least five, six years lined up with that now.
[02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:38.110]  Yeah.
[02:53:38.590 --> 02:53:39.990]  And it is still a Christmas movie.
[02:53:40.310 --> 02:53:41.030]  I'm just saying.
[02:53:41.310 --> 02:53:42.190]  It really is.
[02:53:42.230 --> 02:53:42.950]  It really is.
[02:53:43.630 --> 02:53:44.390]  I know it is.
[02:53:44.390 --> 02:53:45.070]  It is here.
[02:53:45.390 --> 02:53:49.630]  You know, I just got through, uh, watching a creep show again.
[02:53:49.630 --> 02:53:50.750]  You know, I watch that every.
[02:53:50.750 --> 02:53:51.750]  I watch that every time.
[02:53:51.750 --> 02:53:52.790]  I watch that every time.
[02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:53.510]  Creep show.
[02:53:53.670 --> 02:53:53.990]  Yeah.
[02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:55.190]  One and two, man.
[02:53:55.350 --> 02:53:55.750]  Got it.
[02:53:55.750 --> 02:53:56.750]  Got to have it, man.
[02:53:57.230 --> 02:53:58.150]  Those are good.
[02:53:58.230 --> 02:53:59.750]  Oh, Ted dancing.
[02:53:59.750 --> 02:54:03.910]  I remember, uh, the one where they like did Mariam in a beach and shit.
[02:54:03.950 --> 02:54:04.550]  Yeah.
[02:54:05.670 --> 02:54:07.790]  And I have the cockroaches and shit, man.
[02:54:08.470 --> 02:54:11.910]  I had a, a crypt keeper, bong graphics bongs.
[02:54:11.910 --> 02:54:13.150]  I don't know if you ever graphics.
[02:54:13.150 --> 02:54:14.390]  Oh, yeah, dude.
[02:54:14.390 --> 02:54:15.630]  I think so.
[02:54:16.190 --> 02:54:16.550]  Dude.
[02:54:16.550 --> 02:54:19.350]  And so I had like two warehouses at one time.
[02:54:19.350 --> 02:54:20.430]  I don't know if you remember.
[02:54:20.430 --> 02:54:20.910]  I don't know.
[02:54:20.910 --> 02:54:23.910]  I had like two warehouses at one point allegedly.
[02:54:24.270 --> 02:54:28.310]  And I used to keep graphics bongs all over the place, you know, cause
[02:54:28.310 --> 02:54:29.790]  like they're not going to break.
[02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:31.990]  No, I'm over one of bong.
[02:54:31.990 --> 02:54:36.430]  It's like, here's a dirty graphics bong, like throwback, you know, let's do this.
[02:54:37.310 --> 02:54:37.550]  Yeah.
[02:54:37.630 --> 02:54:38.110]  That's awesome.
[02:54:38.190 --> 02:54:40.030]  I had, I had a crypt keeper though.
[02:54:40.030 --> 02:54:41.590]  The crypt keeper was the base.
[02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:42.390]  That was a prize.
[02:54:43.510 --> 02:54:46.310]  That got confiscated by a friend's parent though.
[02:54:48.750 --> 02:54:49.550]  Yeah.
[02:54:49.550 --> 02:54:51.230]  That went into a trash can.
[02:54:51.230 --> 02:54:54.790]  I was like, Oh, I've never lost a bong myself.
[02:54:54.790 --> 02:54:57.790]  It was, it was always through other people's like parents.
[02:54:58.310 --> 02:54:59.870]  That got my bongs taken away.
[02:54:59.870 --> 02:55:02.910]  You gotta go back to those parents and be like, Hey, did that really go in the trash?
[02:55:02.910 --> 02:55:06.470]  Or did you go back out later, pull it out and it's like really in your
[02:55:06.470 --> 02:55:08.350]  basement and you used it for a while.
[02:55:08.950 --> 02:55:09.310]  Right.
[02:55:09.310 --> 02:55:10.350]  Did I get that back?
[02:55:12.110 --> 02:55:15.270]  Oh, that bong went into Lindsey's trash.
[02:55:15.270 --> 02:55:15.710]  Yep.
[02:55:17.990 --> 02:55:18.870]  Damn it, Lindsey.
[02:55:19.310 --> 02:55:19.830]  I know.
[02:55:19.830 --> 02:55:20.830]  Damn it, Lindsey.
[02:55:21.870 --> 02:55:23.670]  We had some good times up at her house though.
[02:55:24.470 --> 02:55:25.310]  Yeah, man.
[02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:28.790]  Oh yeah.
[02:55:29.630 --> 02:55:30.510]  Good times.
[02:55:32.470 --> 02:55:33.590]  Server and dig soup.
[02:55:34.670 --> 02:55:34.990]  Yeah.
[02:55:34.990 --> 02:55:40.350]  I mean, like, you know, I think, I think it's gotta happen now.
[02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:40.910]  Yeah.
[02:55:41.150 --> 02:55:44.230]  It's too much, uh, too much foreplay at this point.
[02:55:44.310 --> 02:55:46.670]  You know, it's gotta, gotta go hard.
[02:55:47.590 --> 02:55:48.110]  Hard.
[02:55:48.950 --> 02:55:51.190]  It has another fucked up ass song.
[02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:52.470]  Fucking Ram ranch.
[02:55:53.150 --> 02:55:55.070]  Somebody sent me that one one time.
[02:55:55.230 --> 02:55:56.950]  I was like, dude, that's fucked up.
[02:55:57.510 --> 02:55:58.510]  Yeah, that's fucked up.
[02:55:58.590 --> 02:55:58.910]  Mike.
[02:55:59.070 --> 02:56:03.870]  So I'm assuming none of these are really on the billboard top 100 charts.
[02:56:04.670 --> 02:56:04.910]  Yeah.
[02:56:04.910 --> 02:56:10.030]  Dick's dick suit might've been back in the day, back in its heyday in the
[02:56:10.030 --> 02:56:15.430]  seventies, uh, country boner might've gotten up there a little bit cause it
[02:56:15.470 --> 02:56:20.550]  was supposed to be, you know, that's a, what's the say some fucking tool.
[02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:21.750]  There's other, yeah.
[02:56:23.190 --> 02:56:23.430]  Yeah.
[02:56:24.750 --> 02:56:25.110]  Yeah.
[02:56:25.430 --> 02:56:25.750]  Yeah.
[02:56:26.270 --> 02:56:31.310]  So imagine Maynard dressed up in country Western outfit, fucking singing like
[02:56:31.310 --> 02:56:34.630]  some fucked up fucking country jam called country boner.
[02:56:35.190 --> 02:56:36.070]  I can see it.
[02:56:37.630 --> 02:56:38.030]  Yeah.
[02:56:38.030 --> 02:56:41.950]  The conditions on my parole album was pretty good.
[02:56:44.870 --> 02:56:45.230]  Yeah.
[02:56:45.670 --> 02:56:47.830]  That sounds like some Johnny cash shit right there.
[02:56:48.350 --> 02:56:48.750]  Yeah.
[02:56:49.230 --> 02:56:51.350]  Johnny cash has mentioned in country boner.
[02:56:52.030 --> 02:56:55.390]  Actually as Kenny Rogers and the judge.
[02:56:56.870 --> 02:56:57.350]  Yeah.
[02:56:57.950 --> 02:56:58.870]  The gambler.
[02:56:59.590 --> 02:57:04.350]  Oh, you know, Kenny, Kenny Rogers, not to be confused with Kenny
[02:57:04.350 --> 02:57:06.430]  Loggins of caddy shack or top gun.
[02:57:06.910 --> 02:57:07.550]  That's right.
[02:57:07.670 --> 02:57:08.070]  That's right.
[02:57:08.070 --> 02:57:12.110]  Kenny Rogers and he had his own fried chicken joint, you know, he did.
[02:57:12.510 --> 02:57:13.110]  Fried chicken.
[02:57:13.270 --> 02:57:13.590]  Yeah.
[02:57:14.470 --> 02:57:14.870]  He did.
[02:57:15.350 --> 02:57:18.670]  He's been, uh, near Nashville for a while.
[02:57:18.670 --> 02:57:22.310]  So I remember the grand old Opry and, you know, Dolly parton, you mentioned her
[02:57:22.310 --> 02:57:28.190]  earlier, that was, that was on TV every, every once a week, grand old Opry.
[02:57:29.190 --> 02:57:30.070]  You know, it's funny.
[02:57:31.230 --> 02:57:31.990]  Fuck it.
[02:57:32.030 --> 02:57:37.550]  Uh, when they breaking bad was on, you know, and, uh, did you watch that Chad?
[02:57:37.870 --> 02:57:38.590]  Breaking bad?
[02:57:39.030 --> 02:57:40.030]  No, no.
[02:57:40.030 --> 02:57:40.990]  That's worth checking out.
[02:57:40.990 --> 02:57:41.830]  How about you, Dave?
[02:57:41.830 --> 02:57:43.150]  Did you watch any breaking bad?
[02:57:43.790 --> 02:57:44.990]  Love that show.
[02:57:45.310 --> 02:57:45.670]  All right.
[02:57:45.670 --> 02:57:49.950]  So you remember, you remember when, uh, they thought they were dead and Gus comes
[02:57:49.950 --> 02:57:54.590]  down to the secret lab and he cuts his own dude's throat and shit, and they, they
[02:57:54.590 --> 02:57:59.510]  get them to change the clothes, you know, and they gave him a fucking, uh, him and
[02:57:59.510 --> 02:58:03.870]  Jesse both had the matching Kenny Rogers t-shirts, like fresh out of a Walmart.
[02:58:03.910 --> 02:58:08.150]  You know, I thought that shit was so funny, like for so many reasons, like,
[02:58:08.470 --> 02:58:12.550]  yeah, the gambler, but it's like, he also owned his own fried chicken restaurant.
[02:58:13.070 --> 02:58:15.110]  Which I thought was pretty fucking funny.
[02:58:16.990 --> 02:58:17.470]  I did.
[02:58:17.470 --> 02:58:18.110]  I, you know what?
[02:58:18.110 --> 02:58:19.670]  You got me on that correlation, man.
[02:58:19.670 --> 02:58:22.390]  That's, that's a, that's new to me, but I see.
[02:58:22.390 --> 02:58:26.070]  I didn't realize he had the, his own chicken restaurant or chicken chain.
[02:58:26.310 --> 02:58:27.270]  His chicken chain.
[02:58:27.310 --> 02:58:27.630]  Yeah.
[02:58:27.630 --> 02:58:28.950]  His own chicken chain, man.
[02:58:29.030 --> 02:58:29.990]  His own chicken chain.
[02:58:30.550 --> 02:58:30.950]  Yep.
[02:58:31.230 --> 02:58:31.510]  Sure.
[02:58:31.510 --> 02:58:31.910]  It did.
[02:58:32.190 --> 02:58:34.710]  So yeah, he had his own, uh, what was it?
[02:58:34.710 --> 02:58:36.710]  Uh, Oh God.
[02:58:36.710 --> 02:58:38.230]  I can't think of the name of the chicken place.
[02:58:38.470 --> 02:58:39.910]  Los Pollo's something.
[02:58:40.230 --> 02:58:40.510]  Yeah.
[02:58:40.510 --> 02:58:42.270]  It's the Pollo's Hermanos.
[02:58:42.310 --> 02:58:42.550]  Yeah.
[02:58:42.550 --> 02:58:43.390]  Chicken brothers.
[02:58:43.390 --> 02:58:43.830]  Yeah.
[02:58:44.150 --> 02:58:44.430]  Yeah.
[02:58:44.430 --> 02:58:45.030]  It was good.
[02:58:45.270 --> 02:58:46.390]  How about better call Saul?
[02:58:46.390 --> 02:58:47.830]  Did you get in that one?
[02:58:47.990 --> 02:58:49.470]  I watched the first couple seasons.
[02:58:49.470 --> 02:58:53.110]  I haven't, I haven't continued since I just, I never got back into it.
[02:58:53.110 --> 02:58:53.750]  It was good though.
[02:58:53.750 --> 02:58:54.670]  I did like it.
[02:58:54.710 --> 02:58:56.830]  Just keep, keep, keep at it, man.
[02:58:56.910 --> 02:59:01.830]  Cause uh, it really, uh, really speeds up and takes off and they just like
[02:59:01.830 --> 02:59:05.230]  showed the last, the very last episode that they were going to make
[02:59:05.230 --> 02:59:07.950]  this over the summer, so it was good.
[02:59:08.830 --> 02:59:09.510]  It was real good.
[02:59:10.910 --> 02:59:11.150]  Yeah.
[02:59:11.150 --> 02:59:12.110]  I'll definitely catch it.
[02:59:12.150 --> 02:59:13.310]  I'll catch up on the rest of it.
[02:59:14.750 --> 02:59:19.550]  Chad, you need to, you need to break your break bad and start watching these.
[02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:20.350]  Yeah.
[02:59:21.070 --> 02:59:25.350]  I haven't built the last like popular TV show that I watched was probably the
[02:59:25.350 --> 02:59:28.150]  Sopranos, like I didn't do the biker one.
[02:59:28.230 --> 02:59:30.630]  Um, no breaking bad.
[02:59:30.630 --> 02:59:33.230]  None of the zombie one walking dead.
[02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:36.750]  Uh, none of the, uh, game of Thrones.
[02:59:37.670 --> 02:59:41.670]  I watched game of Thrones up to the red wedding, like where everybody got murdered
[02:59:42.470 --> 02:59:48.590]  and I saw some Sopranos, but I never really like got like really into it.
[02:59:49.190 --> 02:59:54.710]  Um, same thing with Oz, you know, I was pretty, pretty gnarly show back in the
[02:59:54.710 --> 02:59:57.590]  nineties, but yeah, yeah.
[02:59:57.630 --> 03:00:02.550]  I saw breaking bad when I was in prison because my buddy cow, like he
[03:00:02.550 --> 03:00:04.070]  was like a big time meth cup.
[03:00:04.670 --> 03:00:06.230]  And he's get in there.
[03:00:06.950 --> 03:00:09.590]  Well, they had cable TV, you know?
[03:00:09.630 --> 03:00:11.470]  So like, you know, you had AMC.
[03:00:11.750 --> 03:00:14.430]  So my buddy cow, like he came over to me.
[03:00:14.430 --> 03:00:18.190]  He was like, Hey man, I know you don't watch TV, right?
[03:00:18.550 --> 03:00:21.390]  If you want to, you want to come to the TV room tonight and watch TV.
[03:00:21.390 --> 03:00:22.590]  I was like, not really.
[03:00:23.070 --> 03:00:27.950]  And he was like, bro, there's going to be a TV show on about a dorky ass
[03:00:27.950 --> 03:00:30.470]  motherfucker cooking meth and I'm going to watch it.
[03:00:30.510 --> 03:00:34.910]  And I was like, yeah, I don't think this is good for your life recovery and shit,
[03:00:34.910 --> 03:00:35.270]  man.
[03:00:35.350 --> 03:00:38.030]  Like you're not supposed to be thinking about this shit anymore.
[03:00:38.030 --> 03:00:39.350]  He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:00:39.350 --> 03:00:41.910]  I'm not going to do it, but come on, let's go watch it.
[03:00:41.950 --> 03:00:42.710]  So I did.
[03:00:43.070 --> 03:00:45.950]  I was like, wow, this is like pretty good, pretty good little show.
[03:00:45.950 --> 03:00:48.270]  So watch a few episodes of it.
[03:00:48.310 --> 03:00:53.310]  I got released and I missed a couple when I was on the halfway house, but when I got
[03:00:53.310 --> 03:00:57.430]  back around the way and was able to like see a TV again, I was like, Oh, that's
[03:00:57.430 --> 03:00:58.030]  pretty cool.
[03:00:58.030 --> 03:00:59.110]  And I kept up with it.
[03:00:59.710 --> 03:01:02.630]  I watch Walking Dead up to a point and I got like.
[03:01:03.630 --> 03:01:10.630]  Fucking stupid, and then I tried to catch up on it to see if it got on state and it
[03:01:10.630 --> 03:01:15.470]  never did, but the one dude I liked on it, you know, he was still alive, so let's
[03:01:15.470 --> 03:01:20.590]  check in time to time just to see if he's alive, you know, and he is so.
[03:01:22.390 --> 03:01:24.990]  Yeah, that's where I'm at.
[03:01:25.990 --> 03:01:26.910]  That's all I got to say.
[03:01:27.390 --> 03:01:29.790]  My last biz watch was Cobra Kai, though.
[03:01:30.070 --> 03:01:32.390]  I'm a sucker for the karate kid, man.
[03:01:33.590 --> 03:01:38.110]  You know, my buddy Bumbles, man, he was texting me earlier.
[03:01:38.550 --> 03:01:40.510]  Yeah, he's he's really into that shit, too.
[03:01:41.150 --> 03:01:42.590]  It's surprisingly good.
[03:01:42.830 --> 03:01:46.950]  The new Game of Thrones that just came out or is out now.
[03:01:46.990 --> 03:01:50.230]  That's actually really good to House of the House of the Dragon or whatever.
[03:01:50.550 --> 03:01:54.350]  Yeah, fucking it's it's better than the original Game of Thrones.
[03:01:54.630 --> 03:01:57.870]  And the dragon lady was fucking hot, man.
[03:01:57.990 --> 03:01:59.910]  Oh, yes.
[03:01:59.950 --> 03:02:00.750]  Yes, she was.
[03:02:03.190 --> 03:02:03.870]  I'm sorry, guys.
[03:02:03.950 --> 03:02:04.390]  It is.
[03:02:05.590 --> 03:02:07.750]  You ain't got to apologize for coughing, man.
[03:02:08.150 --> 03:02:09.350]  Got to cough to get off.
[03:02:09.350 --> 03:02:09.950]  You know what I mean?
[03:02:09.990 --> 03:02:10.590]  Yes.
[03:02:10.670 --> 03:02:11.150]  Oh, yeah.
[03:02:11.630 --> 03:02:11.990]  Yeah.
[03:02:13.030 --> 03:02:13.510]  Yeah.
[03:02:14.630 --> 03:02:16.750]  I can't wait to come January.
[03:02:17.350 --> 03:02:18.870]  May fall on panic attack.
[03:02:18.870 --> 03:02:22.950]  Man, I decided to, man, I'm just going to go all in for it.
[03:02:22.950 --> 03:02:24.870]  I might have some silver haze, so I can none.
[03:02:25.550 --> 03:02:26.950]  I'm just going to go all in for it.
[03:02:26.950 --> 03:02:31.510]  I'm going to mix up that some Gany together and just fucking go for it
[03:02:31.510 --> 03:02:35.110]  and peek out the windows and be paranoid and all fucked up.
[03:02:35.470 --> 03:02:36.590]  Just get it out the way.
[03:02:38.110 --> 03:02:41.230]  You can't you can't sheets to fit your windows.
[03:02:42.190 --> 03:02:43.110]  Fuck, yeah, dude.
[03:02:43.590 --> 03:02:44.710]  What do you think those are?
[03:02:45.670 --> 03:02:45.950]  Yeah.
[03:02:48.750 --> 03:02:49.590]  Shit.
[03:02:50.590 --> 03:02:54.830]  Now I bought some blackout curtains and fucking they were in like a black
[03:02:54.830 --> 03:02:59.750]  like packaging, so I assume they'd be black and then open them up
[03:02:59.750 --> 03:03:00.950]  and they were like silver.
[03:03:00.950 --> 03:03:02.870]  And I was like, huh.
[03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:03.310]  All right.
[03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:05.510]  So fuck it.
[03:03:06.750 --> 03:03:07.270]  Words.
[03:03:07.830 --> 03:03:09.030]  Yeah, it's hard.
[03:03:09.150 --> 03:03:12.990]  It's hard to find an actual true blackout fucking curtain, though.
[03:03:12.990 --> 03:03:13.990]  I've tried many.
[03:03:14.710 --> 03:03:14.950]  Yeah.
[03:03:15.430 --> 03:03:18.430]  Yeah, man, because that sunshine definitely wakes me up.
[03:03:19.270 --> 03:03:20.550]  You got to meet yourself.
[03:03:20.550 --> 03:03:21.590]  Brad cough.
[03:03:22.030 --> 03:03:22.510]  It's good.
[03:03:23.830 --> 03:03:24.510]  You get them in.
[03:03:24.830 --> 03:03:25.710]  You get them into the.
[03:03:26.910 --> 03:03:27.990]  Call me out for it.
[03:03:27.990 --> 03:03:28.710]  That was great.
[03:03:31.510 --> 03:03:32.630]  So I can get it in.
[03:03:33.630 --> 03:03:35.350]  Trying to be all professional.
[03:03:35.470 --> 03:03:38.430]  No, this is a professional show.
[03:03:38.910 --> 03:03:40.430]  No, no, man.
[03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:43.790]  Like, I mean, I know you got a lot of followers and all that, but
[03:03:44.310 --> 03:03:50.070]  I think at the end of the day, man, they're just a bunch of staters, too.
[03:03:50.310 --> 03:03:51.030]  You know what I mean?
[03:03:51.750 --> 03:03:53.750]  There might be a spot.
[03:03:53.830 --> 03:03:57.710]  There might be a couple of soccer moms, Tina, but they're probably into that.
[03:03:57.750 --> 03:04:00.230]  They're probably like, look at that fucking guy's hair.
[03:04:00.430 --> 03:04:03.390]  Like I need to find out what what he's got going on.
[03:04:03.790 --> 03:04:05.230]  What's what's the secret?
[03:04:05.230 --> 03:04:07.430]  We. Yeah, I want to know the secret.
[03:04:07.510 --> 03:04:10.870]  You know, we we did hemp shampoo.
[03:04:10.910 --> 03:04:12.390]  H.P.Z.
[03:04:12.910 --> 03:04:19.230]  And see if you add a Z on anything that is I'm saying you're in there.
[03:04:19.510 --> 03:04:19.990]  Yeah.
[03:04:20.470 --> 03:04:23.070]  Hemp's that's that's the shampoo and conditioner.
[03:04:23.870 --> 03:04:24.590]  I see.
[03:04:24.590 --> 03:04:27.150]  I could have thought you were more of a mane and tail guy.
[03:04:30.310 --> 03:04:30.870]  I know.
[03:04:32.230 --> 03:04:38.350]  Herbal essence shampoo conditioner mix the coconut tropical smelling shit.

[03:04:47.750 --> 03:04:48.350]  Yes.

[03:04:54.510 --> 03:04:55.590]  Straight up, man.
[03:04:55.590 --> 03:04:58.910]  They were getting off up in the shower and they're like, what's going on?
[03:04:58.950 --> 03:05:00.990]  You know, it's like, oh, just watching my hair.

[03:12:22.950 --> 03:12:27.950]  So like he had this like fit upper half and he had like a fat guy lower half for a while
[03:12:28.230 --> 03:12:33.470]  He's like short and shit too. So he's all weird looking and then he finally got the rest of it done

[03:18:24.430 --> 03:18:29.830]  This is a good 20 years ago Wow a class DJ a class. That's what it was
[03:18:30.350 --> 03:18:35.910]  I gotta Google this now see if I can find that set. Holy shit DJ. That's awesome
[03:18:36.550 --> 03:18:41.350]  It's like one of the few countries that like will allow me through its borders to visit
[03:18:44.190 --> 03:18:50.870]  Ireland it's a good place to visit. Yeah, definitely. I definitely want to check it out for sure. I
[03:18:52.070 --> 03:18:54.350]  Would yeah, I would love to go my sister's
[03:18:54.990 --> 03:18:59.350]  Husband was from there. So they've been a few times and they've got family but
[03:19:00.550 --> 03:19:02.550]  Never been myself
[03:19:03.190 --> 03:19:07.030]  Yeah, I've only only been to Amsterdam
[03:19:08.910 --> 03:19:15.310]  That's that's my travels but I keep going back there so I'm like they got weed what what what else do you need
[03:19:15.310 --> 03:19:20.350]  They got old stuff. They got museums. They got good food cool people. Yeah, please
[03:19:20.390 --> 03:19:24.510]  They got that too, they're trying to push it out they're trying to get rid of that but
[03:19:25.150 --> 03:19:31.990]  That's they were also they just also this last week voted on whether they would allow still allow tourists into the coffee shops
[03:19:31.990 --> 03:19:33.990]  Which they will but
[03:19:34.630 --> 03:19:37.950]  Amsterdam is is going backwards
[03:19:37.950 --> 03:19:42.630]  I mean they had the chance to be like the world capital of cannabis and they were for a while
[03:19:42.630 --> 03:19:47.550]  But then America started legalizing and we just have better weed
[03:19:47.550 --> 03:19:51.950]  Because they never bothered to legalize it there it's still illegal until it gets into the coffee shop
[03:19:51.950 --> 03:19:53.950]  So the coffee shops are cool to sell it
[03:19:53.950 --> 03:19:59.390]  But you still have to be super clandestine with growing and if you've been over there
[03:19:59.390 --> 03:20:06.710]  You know that every place is like little it's damn the electrical system is not you're not throwing up fucking
[03:20:07.590 --> 03:20:09.590]  20,000 waters, you know, yeah
[03:20:09.590 --> 03:20:14.990]  So talking to Adam done about you know, cuz you know, I was talking to him
[03:20:14.990 --> 03:20:19.790]  You know cuz like you left from here you went over there you're doing your thing and it was like
[03:20:20.350 --> 03:20:26.950]  Dude, everything's so tiny and the amperage that's run the places is so tiny
[03:20:27.510 --> 03:20:30.430]  So I was like, it's really it's challenging, you know
[03:20:31.350 --> 03:20:37.670]  My favorite one and I just learned this there's um, so Mila Jansen. She's that Mila's a hash queen
[03:20:38.550 --> 03:20:40.550]  She resides in Amsterdam
[03:20:40.670 --> 03:20:46.910]  And she was a pretty big grower back in the day and she's the one that invented the bubble bag
[03:20:47.590 --> 03:20:53.830]  Did the pollinators? Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep the pollinator and and I had the chance to talk with her recently
[03:20:54.230 --> 03:21:00.270]  And she was telling me about one grow cuz I made a joke of how the roofs are always you know, and in the in the
[03:21:00.270 --> 03:21:03.870]  Europe it's always the guy who gets busted because the snow melted off the roof
[03:21:05.350 --> 03:21:09.310]  And she went into the woods and she was like, oh, I'm gonna go in the woods
[03:21:09.470 --> 03:21:15.710]  and she went into this story about a bridge that was in Amsterdam like in the city proper and
[03:21:16.350 --> 03:21:21.470]  Apparently like during the war, you know, it was like a safe place to go. It had electricity
[03:21:21.470 --> 03:21:22.790]  I had all of this stuff
[03:21:22.790 --> 03:21:29.350]  but it was unused and like her and her crew figured that out and basically broke in and we're just
[03:21:29.670 --> 03:21:35.470]  Majorly large-scale growing in this place. I'm just like awesome. So badass
[03:21:35.470 --> 03:21:37.470]  Dude like yeah
[03:21:38.950 --> 03:21:40.950]  Under a bridge in the middle of the city
[03:21:43.670 --> 03:21:45.670]  That is
[03:21:45.710 --> 03:21:51.470]  Yeah long I mean, you know a long time ago too. She is an amazing person like she
[03:21:52.390 --> 03:21:55.630]  She sent me her book to which I'm starting to kind of read through now
[03:21:57.790 --> 03:22:04.470]  Talk about someone who likes to just live man and not like really just she just went for it man
[03:22:04.470 --> 03:22:07.110]  she just went for it in a lot of situations and it's like
[03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:12.390]  There's so many humans alive that don't have your balls. Let alone, you know a
[03:22:13.030 --> 03:22:14.310]  female
[03:22:14.310 --> 03:22:16.310]  Especially back in those days
[03:22:17.270 --> 03:22:24.070]  And you don't have fucking regrets, you know, like you get out there and you fucking just do it, you know and
[03:22:25.110 --> 03:22:30.550]  You have such such a fulfilling life that way, you know, it's like yeah
[03:22:30.550 --> 03:22:36.870]  Like everybody's got fucking regrets or whatever, but you know, you get out there and do it like you got like way less regrets
[03:22:37.390 --> 03:22:44.350]  Yeah, yeah, you know, I might regret like getting locked up or whatever, but I'd regret not knowing a whole hell of a lot more
[03:22:44.750 --> 03:22:46.750]  win some lose some but
[03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:51.550]  You get out there and you fucking do it make the most of it and like, you know
[03:22:52.590 --> 03:23:00.110]  Worst case scenario you're on the future cannabis project fucking talking about it. Where's case scenario? Thanks, dude
[03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:02.550]  I
[03:23:13.470 --> 03:23:14.430]  It says
[03:23:14.430 --> 03:23:19.710]  But it's on your right though, man. You gotta you gotta live a little to really live

[03:23:37.990 --> 03:23:39.990]  Is like is
[03:23:41.150 --> 03:23:47.710]  So much that I've been able to do in life and like should I donate? Yeah, probably not but I did it anyway
[03:23:48.230 --> 03:23:54.030]  And it's cool because you know, I can talk on it whether it's good or bad or whatever
[03:23:54.030 --> 03:23:56.030]  You know
[03:23:58.030 --> 03:24:00.110]  When you and when you get a little bit older
[03:24:00.110 --> 03:24:00.510]  it's like
[03:24:00.510 --> 03:24:02.590]  you know I'm older now and I you know, I did a
[03:24:02.790 --> 03:24:09.110]  the music thing music career in that industry for many years and it's like dude, I've already lived like
[03:24:10.950 --> 03:24:12.950]  Like I'm

[03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:31.550]  Naked sushi that was always fun. That was a night that we ran here
[03:24:31.550 --> 03:24:36.010]  It was like every Friday's get some girl with a little bit of paint on her nipples
[03:24:36.470 --> 03:24:39.190]  Toss some sushi on her stomach and give her a mermaid tail

[03:24:51.590 --> 03:24:53.590]  Orders him a beer and looks over
[03:24:54.190 --> 03:25:00.870]  He's this fucking guy beside him. He's got this tiny fucking head like size of a softball
[03:25:00.870 --> 03:25:02.870]  He's like, holy shit
[03:25:03.470 --> 03:25:04.830]  Damn, man
[03:25:04.830 --> 03:25:06.830]  That's tiny head

[03:25:10.670 --> 03:25:12.670]  You say well son
[03:25:12.670 --> 03:25:14.830]  It's in the in the big war
[03:25:15.990 --> 03:25:17.990]  WW2
[03:25:17.990 --> 03:25:20.310]  And you know
[03:25:20.310 --> 03:25:23.390]  Fucking torpedo sunk our ship, but I swam to shore
[03:25:24.270 --> 03:25:26.270]  everybody else got eaten by sharks and
[03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:28.950]  going in an ugly ugly scene
[03:25:29.470 --> 03:25:33.470]  But I made it ashore this desert island and I was there
[03:25:34.470 --> 03:25:40.190]  Starving and dehydrated and I thought I was gonna die and a mermaid comes to shore
[03:25:41.390 --> 03:25:44.830]  Beautiful beautiful mermaid and she offers me three wishes
[03:25:45.150 --> 03:25:50.310]  So, of course, you know my first two are food and water, you know starving and dehydrated
[03:25:51.150 --> 03:25:53.150]  for my third wish I
[03:25:53.190 --> 03:25:58.950]  Look at her and she was just so beautiful. So I asked her. Yeah, how about a piece of ass?
[03:26:00.270 --> 03:26:06.510]  She's like well, sir. I'm half fish. You see I don't have the components to make that happen
[03:26:06.510 --> 03:26:08.790]  It's like I fuck it. How about a little head?
[03:26:08.830 --> 03:26:10.870]  It's like I fuck it how about a little head
[03:26:18.420 --> 03:26:20.060]  Nice

[03:26:21.420 --> 03:26:23.500]  Little head so be careful what you wish for
[03:26:24.620 --> 03:26:26.620]  Or you might get a foamy beer
[03:26:27.620 --> 03:26:34.860]  Every one of them. So the red stripe won't fucking pop but the Dale pale ale fucking fucking foam up on you every time
[03:26:35.700 --> 03:26:37.700]  That's a little head
[03:26:42.940 --> 03:26:44.940]  That was real fucking nice

[03:26:58.620 --> 03:27:02.660]  So how many people are left now we've actually gained two
[03:27:05.820 --> 03:27:07.980]  We're climbing back up to our peak
[03:27:07.980 --> 03:27:09.980]  Yeah
[03:27:09.980 --> 03:27:15.620]  That's awesome. What was it like 150 or something at some point? Ah, we were
[03:27:16.740 --> 03:27:18.740]  Yeah, 200
[03:27:18.900 --> 03:27:20.380]  couple hundred people
[03:27:20.380 --> 03:27:26.780]  Yeah, I bet you I bet you a lot of Maurice coast, you know, and yeah, it's like Wednesday
[03:27:26.780 --> 03:27:28.780]  So they probably had to go to bed
[03:27:28.940 --> 03:27:31.380]  They're probably in true. It's true
[03:27:31.860 --> 03:27:33.860]  Yeah, yeah
[03:27:33.980 --> 03:27:40.740]  Like I got no feel for it man like between Brian Marquez show your show like I got a feel for it now
[03:27:41.100 --> 03:27:43.900]  Yeah, some pretty pretty gnarly people
[03:27:46.540 --> 03:27:51.380]  Yeah, you know you do and Brian I bet Brian's asleep by now he was he was in here earlier
[03:27:51.380 --> 03:27:56.740]  He was you were getting accused of stealing his bike. But yeah, it's fine
[03:27:58.100 --> 03:28:00.660]  It's not his bike anymore. So it's right
[03:28:01.540 --> 03:28:04.140]  He'll get another bike. It was a nice
[03:28:05.420 --> 03:28:07.420]  possessions, man
[03:28:20.740 --> 03:28:23.380]  No, I did like the alien works people
[03:28:24.220 --> 03:28:30.460]  Like really the only company so when I started out it was Powell Peralta because that was really the only company they were you know
[03:28:30.460 --> 03:28:33.900]  Making like animal chin and ban this those were the only skate videos
[03:28:36.460 --> 03:28:40.340]  Like the only company I was ever really diehard about was independent trucks
[03:28:40.340 --> 03:28:45.220]  I was getting ready to say independent like that's that's what I was have been hardcore about
[03:28:46.060 --> 03:28:51.660]  Open up my secret wall ball here. Bum bum bum. Yeah, and
[03:28:52.220 --> 03:28:53.380]  and
[03:28:53.380 --> 03:28:55.980]  Then you know a like antihero skateboards
[03:28:56.100 --> 03:29:00.180]  I think those guys cuz those are just like the beer drinking fucking dirt bag
[03:29:00.180 --> 03:29:04.580]  Like we'll sleep at the bottom of the pool at the skate park because we have nowhere else to go sleep
[03:29:04.580 --> 03:29:08.420]  I love those guys. They were all fucking awesome. I was in Northern, California
[03:29:10.020 --> 03:29:12.740]  Managing Santa Rosa actually managing a skate shop
[03:29:13.900 --> 03:29:19.060]  When I was doing my audio engineering shit. Yeah, that's a sick bag, dude
[03:29:20.740 --> 03:29:25.060]  The kind the kind and indie collab that's fucking sick
[03:29:26.820 --> 03:29:28.820]  For so I used to do
[03:29:29.500 --> 03:29:33.120]  Instrumentation in this bag, so I'd have to climb up, you know
[03:29:33.120 --> 03:29:36.580]  Two three hundred feet up in the air and like work on some crazy shit
[03:29:36.660 --> 03:29:41.780]  So I used to put all my shit in this bag even like all them all them years later
[03:29:42.460 --> 03:29:44.060]  fucking
[03:29:44.060 --> 03:29:46.060]  Yeah
[03:29:46.340 --> 03:29:48.260]  Well
[03:29:48.260 --> 03:29:51.260]  Make good stuff man. I mean good stuff
[03:29:52.180 --> 03:29:55.980]  Terrible they made it through all that shit. It's still still good to go
[03:29:57.580 --> 03:29:59.580]  Hell yeah, so
[03:30:00.580 --> 03:30:03.940]  That that's the one company that I was have been diehard to
[03:30:05.900 --> 03:30:10.500]  Everything else though I kind of just whatever I was sponsored for a while with skateboarding
[03:30:10.500 --> 03:30:12.620]  so I would get just kind of flow stuff and
[03:30:13.180 --> 03:30:16.620]  All right it usually if I pick up a board now, I just pick up a blank
[03:30:16.860 --> 03:30:21.540]  It's really more about like the size and the concave for me than a you know graphic
[03:30:21.980 --> 03:30:28.300]  Yeah, but my buddies back in Virginia wanted me to get the live guy printed up on some blanks
[03:30:28.340 --> 03:30:32.980]  You know, you put whatever trucks you want on it and shit. That's cool. Yeah
[03:30:33.500 --> 03:30:37.100]  Just so the fuck of it, right? There's there's a guy
[03:30:38.060 --> 03:30:44.020]  Lobster, he's he's up in Maine and he does stuff. He was actually in the show or in the chat earlier
[03:30:44.460 --> 03:30:47.740]  But he does shows on the future cannabis project as well
[03:30:47.900 --> 03:30:53.980]  he owns a company called rotten skateboards and he puts out some decks and stuff that
[03:30:54.500 --> 03:31:00.180]  Shit, you guys should collab on something collab on it like a deck seed release. That would be kind of fucking ill actually
[03:31:00.580 --> 03:31:05.580]  Yeah, for real cuz like a lot of my a lot of my people back back home and they're like
[03:31:05.740 --> 03:31:11.340]  They're really into their skating and shit like out of Richmond and Virginia Beach and shit like that. So
[03:31:11.820 --> 03:31:13.820]  Yeah, that's surfing
[03:31:14.060 --> 03:31:21.180]  Yeah, which is weird because I've always pictured surfing as a West Coast thing. But yeah, there really is surfing out like
[03:31:21.980 --> 03:31:23.980]  Carolina and stuff
[03:31:26.420 --> 03:31:33.780]  Yeah, my buddy booth he was talking earlier whatever you brought one of those little messages up he's he's a surfer
[03:31:34.300 --> 03:31:42.300]  Nice. Yeah straight up apocalypse now fucking Charlie don't surf one goes left one goes, right?
[03:31:44.020 --> 03:31:46.380]  He's fucking far out dude
[03:31:51.030 --> 03:31:56.390]  Both the grid. Yeah. Yeah, that's the dude he likes to surf
[03:31:58.390 --> 03:32:01.190]  Booth secret. Oh, there is booth the grit
[03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:04.750]  Yeah

[03:43:04.810 --> 03:43:08.970]  Did like I'll sleep next to her I'll smell her breath but no
[03:43:09.970 --> 03:43:11.970]  So look I
[03:43:12.690 --> 03:43:16.370]  Was going to the canicum stopped by Adam Dunn's thing
[03:43:17.130 --> 03:43:24.450]  And I went on there for like three minutes and as I left the D Davis like hey, man, here is peanut butter
[03:43:24.450 --> 03:43:26.690]  I was like peanut butter and I got at it
[03:43:26.690 --> 03:43:31.130]  It was locked off camera and he's like yeah for the dogs and I turned around look I was like
[03:43:32.130 --> 03:43:34.130]  for the dogs
[03:43:38.970 --> 03:43:46.450]  I had a boy back home, Virginia named his three dogs after peanut butter fucking skip eat it Peter Pan and Jim
[03:43:49.690 --> 03:43:52.090]  There is a difference man Jif rules, okay
[03:43:52.650 --> 03:43:58.770]  Jeff is pretty fucking banging man, but you know Peter Pan's got the better honey, honey peanut butter
[03:43:59.170 --> 03:44:06.090]  Yeah, but here's the thing like what one of the best things about a new jar of peanut butter cuz I get the creamy
[03:44:06.090 --> 03:44:08.130]  So everything is nice and smooth now
[03:44:08.130 --> 03:44:13.250]  It's a bonus if you get that little metal part or you know that lid part without any peanut butter on it
[03:44:13.250 --> 03:44:18.010]  That means you have a pure jar, but my big thing with the new jar of Jif
[03:44:18.650 --> 03:44:22.450]  Is waiting to crack that like that seal? Yeah
[03:44:23.770 --> 03:44:25.570]  with the Jif
[03:44:25.570 --> 03:44:33.090]  With the Jif there's no better smell and you know, you can mix your key right into the peanut butter. It's like a solvent
[03:44:33.890 --> 03:44:37.730]  Yeah, yeah, yeah you can you can you can eat that
[03:44:39.170 --> 03:44:44.930]  Man, I feel really like left out of this because I was so poor we didn't get fancy Jif
[03:44:48.450 --> 03:44:53.410]  The fancy that's that's how long this stuff's been sitting in there
[03:44:54.570 --> 03:44:59.810]  Hmm every now and then every now and then I'll dig into it age to perfection
[03:45:01.010 --> 03:45:04.280]  Yeah
[03:45:04.680 --> 03:45:06.680]  Doesn't smell too good
[03:45:09.160 --> 03:45:14.920]  Then I got I make I like making my little mini my little personal size temple balls
[03:45:19.960 --> 03:45:23.840]  You know, I like the I like the the pressed hash, you know
[03:45:23.840 --> 03:45:29.480]  Which is something that was really common in Amsterdam and you know Europe and stuff. I much prefer that to

[03:45:36.840 --> 03:45:40.120]  Like I like I like dry sieving
[03:45:40.120 --> 03:45:45.040]  Yeah, it was a good screen set and then yeah pressing it with a little bit of light heat
[03:45:45.240 --> 03:45:49.400]  And then just like pulling it off like some taffy, you know
[03:45:49.400 --> 03:45:55.160]  Yeah, put it on top of a bowl or maybe on top of a screen and just going at you
[03:45:55.480 --> 03:46:02.760]  Yeah, I really I really dig that too man like that Joe all a bad thing we were talking about that's what it's all about
[03:46:03.360 --> 03:46:08.860]  It's just all about doing exactly exactly that I got a Lebanese thing going on too
[03:46:08.860 --> 03:46:12.480]  And that's exactly this war and when they're both right on both sides

[03:46:36.800 --> 03:46:39.900]  Is that kind of mainly what you do is just a little ball popper

[03:46:46.720 --> 03:46:51.320]  Get you an old-school metal bowl, right and don't buy any screens
[03:46:51.960 --> 03:46:56.520]  Go to like your local like gas station or something and unscrew the fucking faucet
[03:47:04.480 --> 03:47:06.480]  Ingredient is the crime
[03:47:07.240 --> 03:47:09.820]  You put that in your in your new bowl and yeah
[03:47:10.820 --> 03:47:16.400]  Rest them on that and then did you ever like when you're like taking the screens out of the sinks at the hardware store or
[03:47:16.400 --> 03:47:19.500]  Wherever you're doing it and it had the little rubber ring around it
[03:47:19.500 --> 03:47:22.540]  So you try to like peel the rubber off before you?
[03:47:23.540 --> 03:47:28.380]  But don't forget you have to burn the screen and let the smoke go off and then it's safe
[03:47:30.660 --> 03:47:36.640]  Yeah, you need like all weatherman tool or some needle nose or something all of it and burn that fucker dough it's getting red
[03:47:36.860 --> 03:47:38.860]  Yeah, let it cool down

[03:47:43.860 --> 03:47:49.700]  So that that's the key, you know, you do it like that and you'll you'll be a pretty happy guy, man

[03:51:40.940 --> 03:51:42.940]  Holla
[03:51:47.580 --> 03:51:49.580]  Interesting that Apple fritter is
[03:51:50.140 --> 03:51:55.860]  Something I've been seeing put into a lot of things, but I haven't really seen the flower hit commercially
[03:51:55.860 --> 03:52:01.100]  I've had it commercially but commercial weed sucks. It's never a good representation of what a
[03:52:01.660 --> 03:52:03.660]  body
[03:52:03.980 --> 03:52:08.140]  He grows like so like he's got friends that
[03:52:09.420 --> 03:52:10.660]  it
[03:52:10.660 --> 03:52:12.660]  is so
[03:52:12.660 --> 03:52:17.180]  They're in like, you know trying different clones out and shit newest of the new yada yada
[03:52:17.180 --> 03:52:21.120]  But he uh, he got I think he called it
[03:52:22.700 --> 03:52:25.300]  Lumpy's fucking critter cut or some shit
[03:52:25.740 --> 03:52:30.140]  Right out like it's got it's got good structure good yield
[03:52:30.380 --> 03:52:33.740]  It's got like pretty nice little little nose on it and everything
[03:52:34.260 --> 03:52:36.260]  I haven't been able to smoke it
[03:52:37.980 --> 03:52:42.300]  Everything else kind of tells me like hey, it's probably probably pretty good
[03:52:43.820 --> 03:52:49.980]  Yep, and one of those bitches I didn't pop the whole pack. We're having we're having a request to Dave
[03:52:50.580 --> 03:52:54.620]  We need to get back into character. So please if you could
[03:52:55.540 --> 03:52:57.540]  while announcing your seeds
[03:52:57.660 --> 03:52:58.940]  remain
[03:52:58.940 --> 03:53:00.940]  super Dave
[03:53:03.020 --> 03:53:08.580]  Well now yes, I'm close and personal deep like if you really want me to
[03:53:10.060 --> 03:53:14.340]  Especially if I get a little rasp going in the voice a little smokers
[03:53:15.020 --> 03:53:20.100]  Speech if you will and you got an S on the end. Oh, yes
[03:53:21.100 --> 03:53:25.580]  You got a face for radio I
[03:53:29.620 --> 03:53:36.300]  Mean a voice a voice Wow. Well, there's a reason I'm not on camera guys
[03:53:50.100 --> 03:53:52.100]  There's a reason I'm not on camera fellas
[03:54:02.620 --> 03:54:07.700]  Dave do you know what sour katsu used? I don't myself
[03:54:09.900 --> 03:54:13.300]  It's it's a res dog that he got from Stoney
[03:54:14.220 --> 03:54:16.220]  the earlier one was a
[03:54:16.260 --> 03:54:18.780]  East Coast sour which is also res but
[03:54:19.500 --> 03:54:24.580]  Okay, okay then we got a question for Duke
[03:54:26.900 --> 03:54:28.340]  Have you ever
[03:54:28.340 --> 03:54:36.100]  Have you ever tried using like rootstock very popular. Actually, that's how apples and other fruits are grown
[03:54:36.740 --> 03:54:40.060]  You just graft onto it. Have you tried grafting any cannabis?
[03:54:41.140 --> 03:54:46.200]  I didn't have success with it. But man this lady on a forum back in like
[03:54:47.160 --> 03:54:54.440]  2005 or where it was like kind of a competition like make like a franken plant. Mine didn't do good
[03:54:56.040 --> 03:54:58.680]  But hers did you know, but
[03:54:59.360 --> 03:55:02.560]  You know, it's kind of kind of a weird weird thing
[03:55:03.120 --> 03:55:04.560]  like the
[03:55:04.560 --> 03:55:08.320]  so like what was being grafted together like the bud that
[03:55:08.760 --> 03:55:14.120]  Should have been like one tight versus another type. It didn't quite come out, right?
[03:55:15.120 --> 03:55:18.600]  Okay, I've always I've been interested in it because
[03:55:19.240 --> 03:55:23.720]  Again common practice in orchards something I've done a million times
[03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:30.600]  Not really with cannabis again. You kind of have to hit that little layer to graft it, right?
[03:55:31.120 --> 03:55:32.480]  but I
[03:55:32.480 --> 03:55:38.240]  Don't know what the advantages would be. It'd be fun to play around with though. I tell you
[03:55:38.920 --> 03:55:43.600]  Fun to play around with you. So back in the day, you remember John Bobbitt?
[03:55:44.160 --> 03:55:46.160]  No, God. Yeah
[03:55:47.120 --> 03:55:49.120]  Used to be yeah
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:55.680]  The lady hacked his wiener off and they reattached it and then a porn star
[03:55:56.960 --> 03:56:01.680]  You know, he made he made the one, you know, okay. I wasn't a big fan. Yes
[03:56:05.160 --> 03:56:07.160]  Okay, he's made more than I have
[03:56:07.160 --> 03:56:12.440]  But uh, yeah my buddy pickle he was really into his porn but
[03:56:16.720 --> 03:56:18.720]  Frank and wiener
[03:56:20.720 --> 03:56:22.720]  You're serious
[03:56:26.160 --> 03:56:30.280]  Yeah, my buddy pickles a chronic masturbator like he's got like a condition
[03:56:30.280 --> 03:56:34.600]  So he's got like a porn collection like fill up like a spare bedroom
[03:56:34.600 --> 03:56:40.280]  Does he not know about like the internet and hard drives no, no, this is all before the internet
[03:56:40.280 --> 03:56:47.720]  Yeah, okay. Yeah, like how Dave's sleep collection is there he's got fucking DHS and DVDs like that
[03:56:48.280 --> 03:56:54.440]  Got everything in there. Oh, yeah. All right. We got one another question here
[03:56:55.680 --> 03:56:57.680]  and
[03:56:57.920 --> 03:57:00.120]  It's because it has please at the end
[03:57:00.120 --> 03:57:04.520]  Duke about the Afghani he used to make the Screaming Eagle, please
[03:57:05.160 --> 03:57:07.160]  Thanks
[03:57:07.160 --> 03:57:12.280]  Yeah, and you know the thing about dog days like he's got my phone number. He could oh
[03:57:13.160 --> 03:57:17.560]  But he's staying up late. He's you know, then the content and shit
[03:57:18.600 --> 03:57:22.560]  So that I am a very piney rubbery
[03:57:23.800 --> 03:57:25.800]  short stature
[03:57:25.800 --> 03:57:28.040]  Danny very piney rubbery
[03:57:29.080 --> 03:57:31.080]  short stature
[03:57:31.920 --> 03:57:35.520]  Like it stretches but not like, you know anything crazy
[03:57:36.440 --> 03:57:38.280]  Little less than double in size
[03:57:38.280 --> 03:57:44.200]  So it stacks up all the way and had like a nice put your dick in the dirt type high to it
[03:57:45.360 --> 03:57:49.080]  That that's what I that's what I decided to use today
[03:57:49.920 --> 03:57:54.520]  you had like really good thick stems, which it was kind of weird because
[03:57:55.800 --> 03:58:00.280]  I hit that to the 88 and then drew those out and they stayed like, you know
[03:58:00.400 --> 03:58:07.280]  Like expected really thick stems like strong branching, you know good fat yields and everything
[03:58:07.280 --> 03:58:13.120]  I was like, alright cool grow out the females and everything, you know start taking notes
[03:58:13.120 --> 03:58:16.680]  So like how everything's being passed along the gene pairs and shit
[03:58:17.080 --> 03:58:23.480]  So I like I select this fucking male out I hit the airborne g13, which is kind of the same
[03:58:23.480 --> 03:58:28.640]  You know, it's kind of like stocky little cush my aunt and all I hit it and then I get these plants
[03:58:28.640 --> 03:58:35.920]  They're like tripling and fucking flower and shit. I was like, what the fuck this shit may happen, but it kind of worked out
[03:58:36.920 --> 03:58:44.760]  I was expecting a little something a little bit tighter. But yeah, they fucking I guess this maybe all the hybrid bigger
[03:58:49.120 --> 03:58:51.120]  When you
[03:58:51.440 --> 03:58:56.640]  When you yeah, I mean when you're mixing two things that are really diverse you're supposed to get that
[03:58:57.120 --> 03:59:00.280]  Yeah, and definitely did that's for sure
[03:59:01.240 --> 03:59:04.280]  And you saw that primarily in the stretch
[03:59:05.280 --> 03:59:07.040]  Yeah
[03:59:07.040 --> 03:59:12.160]  Like you're talking about shit that went like from double to triple Wow
[03:59:13.920 --> 03:59:21.000]  That breaks my heart sometimes I had to get rid of one recently awesome profile, but it just stretched so
[03:59:21.640 --> 03:59:26.840]  like so unbelievably hard that is I wish I could put like a picture of
[03:59:27.720 --> 03:59:30.440]  something like in here, you know, but
[03:59:32.800 --> 03:59:37.400]  So like back in the day right I got the sour diesel clone
[03:59:39.040 --> 03:59:45.680]  Grease some out and had like no idea like exactly how much it's stretching everything
[03:59:46.400 --> 03:59:48.520]  And it's like oh fuck, you know
[03:59:48.520 --> 03:59:52.560]  So we ended up doing these fucking ebb and flow trace, right?
[03:59:52.560 --> 03:59:58.100]  And just packing them full and like force firing coins like giving them like seven days of edge
[03:59:59.080 --> 04:00:05.040]  packing all these fucking like four inch squares and like side-by-side through a fucking four by four and
[04:00:05.240 --> 04:00:09.440]  Just blooming them off and see like it's stretched like a motherfucker, too
[04:00:09.440 --> 04:00:15.040]  But it's stacked up like crazy and like, you know when they came out with that three a light book
[04:00:15.040 --> 04:00:17.040]  We're like, yeah
[04:00:21.560 --> 04:00:24.240]  The fucking organic shit, but
[04:00:24.920 --> 04:00:25.680]  Yeah, man
[04:00:25.680 --> 04:00:28.240]  Like it comes in handy like, you know
[04:00:28.240 --> 04:00:32.560]  If you know that ahead of time like we were talking about the information on the seed pack
[04:00:32.840 --> 04:00:37.440]  If you knew that ahead of time and you knew you were gonna be like a little vertically challenged
[04:00:37.720 --> 04:00:41.160]  You'd go out that mom and like take those cuttings or whatever
[04:00:41.600 --> 04:00:46.760]  So it kind of like saves you time like you don't have to bet you're cutting it as much
[04:00:47.120 --> 04:00:47.760]  You know
[04:00:47.760 --> 04:00:50.960]  You give it like a couple weeks or whatever and go ahead and flip them off
[04:00:50.960 --> 04:00:55.600]  And like they fill in that space like real good and like you can get more turns
[04:00:56.040 --> 04:01:01.080]  Turns per year, you know that way if you take take advantage of it and shit
[04:01:04.160 --> 04:01:06.160]  Make it rain make it
[04:01:06.160 --> 04:01:08.160]  Rain

[04:03:06.880 --> 04:03:08.880]  your fruit ferments
[04:03:09.040 --> 04:03:15.840]  Now you use fruit ferments on your plants. What what or you're using them? How how is that?
[04:03:16.760 --> 04:03:21.400]  Helping you or why how did you get to fruit ferments on your plants?
[04:03:22.520 --> 04:03:24.520]  well, so
[04:03:25.760 --> 04:03:27.760]  Two part question I guess
[04:03:28.880 --> 04:03:34.320]  Maybe three maybe four. Well, I'm not phrasing it as eloquently as
[04:03:35.480 --> 04:03:41.280]  Janice has here. Janice. I see Duke using fruit ferments and I'm wondering what that's for
[04:03:41.280 --> 04:03:43.280]  See, I should have just put the question
[04:03:43.800 --> 04:03:45.800]  Try and do
[04:03:46.440 --> 04:03:53.120]  That's one rad lady right there, I'm uh, I'm just gonna tell you like that's a really cool lady right there
[04:03:53.280 --> 04:03:57.400]  And you know, it's even cooler she's on the East Coast so Wow
[04:03:58.040 --> 04:04:00.040]  Like two in the morning there right now
[04:04:00.440 --> 04:04:02.440]  It sure is
[04:04:03.240 --> 04:04:08.520]  That's super fucking cool trooper award. Yeah, so
[04:04:12.320 --> 04:04:14.320]  You forgot the question didn't you?
[04:04:15.280 --> 04:04:21.440]  Okay, I'm good. I'm good. I was just thinking I was like my beer feels a little bit on the empty side
[04:04:21.480 --> 04:04:29.000]  So I'll have to go for number whatever it is. So, um the way that I came to it
[04:04:29.920 --> 04:04:31.920]  was thinking about
[04:04:32.360 --> 04:04:37.880]  natural natural sugars and shit like that and then I thought about like well if
[04:04:38.920 --> 04:04:43.840]  Terpenes, right if they're if you know, it's not just in weed, you know
[04:04:43.840 --> 04:04:47.120]  They're in flowers and fruits and vegetables and all that
[04:04:47.240 --> 04:04:54.840]  I thought to myself like if you were to take that right and find like, you know terpenes that are common in
[04:04:54.960 --> 04:04:56.960]  Yeah, marijuana
[04:04:57.720 --> 04:04:59.720]  Marijuana marijuana
[04:05:05.240 --> 04:05:06.760]  But uh
[04:05:06.760 --> 04:05:13.440]  Yeah, so if you were to have those right if you were to break them down and microbes eat it eat things up and they
[04:05:13.440 --> 04:05:15.440]  Poop them out and they make them plain available
[04:05:16.040 --> 04:05:19.200]  Wouldn't that like maybe in turn like, you know
[04:05:19.480 --> 04:05:26.240]  kind of like be feeding raw terpenes up because it all started with like using like fruit that wanna and
[04:05:27.040 --> 04:05:28.240]  thinking like
[04:05:28.240 --> 04:05:34.160]  Why does this not wanna make my weed stink so much like it's not just like an NPK thing
[04:05:34.160 --> 04:05:41.520]  Like there's more to this. It's like well, there's little bastards are eating fruit and they're digesting it and their little bat
[04:05:42.080 --> 04:05:45.800]  Stomachs and then they're you know, they're little enzymes and they're pooping it out
[04:05:46.640 --> 04:05:48.920]  Maybe that's why like the weeds thinking more
[04:05:49.280 --> 04:05:55.660]  So maybe the fruit if we break it down with like, you know some enzymes and some you know
[04:05:56.280 --> 04:05:58.280]  some microbes here
[04:05:58.280 --> 04:06:05.080]  Yeah, maybe I can feed that to my plants and maybe it'll make them stink even more and then I got to like reading like
[04:06:06.080 --> 04:06:08.280]  BioAg fucking white papers about
[04:06:08.760 --> 04:06:15.360]  terpene chains and everything and the importance of sulfur and how the sulfur molecule completes a terpene chain
[04:06:16.280 --> 04:06:18.280]  yada yada yada yada, so
[04:06:19.240 --> 04:06:21.240]  any who's I
[04:06:21.760 --> 04:06:23.760]  I did it. I
[04:06:24.320 --> 04:06:31.360]  Basically was like figure like it's like making brandy, but instead of yeast, you know, we're gonna have microbes in
[04:06:32.360 --> 04:06:34.400]  Let them break that shit down, you know
[04:06:34.400 --> 04:06:40.000]  it's like County Jail toilet wand and then strain that shit all out all the solids and
[04:06:40.280 --> 04:06:43.120]  Then start feeding it to the plants and I did
[04:06:43.720 --> 04:06:47.320]  Like there's like a little NPK value to it as well
[04:06:47.320 --> 04:06:51.200]  But we definitely stink way way fucking more
[04:06:51.560 --> 04:06:57.240]  So using that in combination with like Epsom salt, you know magnesium sulfate
[04:06:57.520 --> 04:07:02.920]  Some facilitating the phosphorus uptake and all that good shit, but that's all for you know
[04:07:03.760 --> 04:07:07.040]  Front-loading that shit up. So the sulfur molecules are present
[04:07:07.040 --> 04:07:11.120]  It's a complete terpene chains and all the natural sugars and carbohydrates
[04:07:11.640 --> 04:07:16.120]  Dude, the weed just grew better and then it's stank even more. So that's
[04:07:17.120 --> 04:07:20.600]  That's where I come off kind of came to fucking around with that
[04:07:21.240 --> 04:07:23.240]  Did it help with like all?
[04:07:23.720 --> 04:07:27.280]  Kinds of smells like would it make gas more stank and would it make like a
[04:07:27.720 --> 04:07:31.160]  Orange more stank as well, or was it just a steak?
[04:07:31.560 --> 04:07:37.960]  So let's say like we got like Cali. Oh, right, you know, so I got was growing that back then
[04:07:37.960 --> 04:07:39.800]  So it's like crazy orange, right?
[04:07:39.800 --> 04:07:45.480]  and then say like we're growing like some chem dog and we're on some skunk and some
[04:07:45.680 --> 04:07:50.280]  Some Cindy name and salt pineapple and like blueberry. That's blueberry
[04:07:50.840 --> 04:07:58.360]  So if I take orange juice right now were to break blend up a bunch of oranges the rinds and the whole shit oranges and
[04:07:59.200 --> 04:08:05.560]  Just do that and I feed that shit to all the plants. It's not gonna make the blueberry
[04:08:06.280 --> 04:08:13.040]  Smell like orange. So I'm a Ken dog smell like orange, but that Cali Oh would like really really pop
[04:08:13.520 --> 04:08:21.000]  So since I grew like such a diverse garden back then I was basically looking for like every fruit and herb
[04:08:21.280 --> 04:08:26.800]  And shit underneath the Sun and I would break it all down together and just make this cocktail
[04:08:27.360 --> 04:08:33.080]  that I could just put in the water and like, you know kind of feed to everybody and I kind of figured like
[04:08:33.280 --> 04:08:40.000]  It would just be optimal for everything all around, you know, I figure like I could like Taylor make it
[04:08:40.600 --> 04:08:41.800]  to a
[04:08:41.800 --> 04:08:48.600]  Like a very specific cultivar if I wanted to but dude, I always grow so much fucking different shit
[04:08:48.600 --> 04:08:54.080]  That's right. I just mix it all up. So, you know you look at like I
[04:08:55.280 --> 04:09:01.160]  Tell you what man fucking Pacific Northwest love bro gooseberries, you know
[04:09:02.120 --> 04:09:03.440]  Yes
[04:09:03.440 --> 04:09:05.440]  What's for the gooseberry?
[04:09:06.560 --> 04:09:09.080]  If it's not the top one, it's one of them
[04:09:09.440 --> 04:09:12.960]  Hmm it's like more terpenes and like anything right?
[04:09:13.440 --> 04:09:17.320]  But like the most amount of different terpenes
[04:09:17.320 --> 04:09:23.020]  I should say and it also produces like two that are very unique just to the gooseberry, right?
[04:09:24.320 --> 04:09:27.940]  But like mercy and right that's like a really good one, you know
[04:09:27.940 --> 04:09:32.920]  So we're gonna use some mangoes right break that shit down for the mercy and content
[04:09:33.520 --> 04:09:39.800]  Pining right alpha beta pining, you know, I got fucking pinion pines right in my fucking back
[04:09:40.520 --> 04:09:45.600]  Backyard now, so I can take mince up pine needles and shit sage rosemary
[04:09:46.320 --> 04:09:47.360]  oregano
[04:09:47.360 --> 04:09:49.360]  oranges apples pears
[04:09:49.560 --> 04:09:55.800]  Cranberries like all that shit. Yeah, and I make a make like a proper fucking slop
[04:09:56.400 --> 04:09:58.400]  brew it all up and
[04:09:58.960 --> 04:10:02.920]  Strain it out and then I feed that shit like 10 mils a gallon and
[04:10:03.440 --> 04:10:07.600]  our plants like they really love it like nutritionally wise to but
[04:10:08.560 --> 04:10:12.320]  Terrapin wise dude, I'll send you a Christmas sampler fucking Chad
[04:10:12.320 --> 04:10:17.440]  I'll I'll send you some weed and like you can smell it like
[04:10:18.960 --> 04:10:24.560]  You know, I don't even toot my own horn, but I tell you man like I grow I grow some pretty pretty good
[04:10:25.520 --> 04:10:31.560]  And people always tell me it's like it's really a lot stinkier than the next guy so
[04:10:32.560 --> 04:10:38.560]  Well, I like that because I do grow a lot of those aromatic things outside like, you know, I've got lavender
[04:10:38.560 --> 04:10:40.560]  I've got sage. I've got
[04:10:41.080 --> 04:10:43.080]  rosemary
[04:10:44.320 --> 04:10:49.320]  Lemon balm I've got a few of those fragrant things that have those common terpenes
[04:10:49.640 --> 04:10:51.640]  And all I'm hearing is when a little
[04:10:52.640 --> 04:10:59.400]  pining lemonade and all that need like that's what you want and like he can break all that down and
[04:10:59.800 --> 04:11:01.600]  make quite the
[04:11:01.600 --> 04:11:03.600]  Quite the little cocktail my friend
[04:11:03.720 --> 04:11:10.400]  Yeah, I'll have to ask my wife to if we've got gooseberries in the immediate area because she knows I think we actually do
[04:11:10.400 --> 04:11:12.760]  Across the street, but she will know for sure
[04:11:13.400 --> 04:11:18.360]  Wow, that's interesting. I like I like oh my god, I like that
[04:11:18.920 --> 04:11:22.200]  I also like what Dave is. Whoa. We'll bring it back
[04:11:23.480 --> 04:11:26.520]  Don't worry. I'm bringing it back. Yeah
[04:11:29.640 --> 04:11:32.680]  And blackbird preservations I
[04:11:34.840 --> 04:11:39.720]  Always I almost always called Jimmy toucans I almost always say Joey toucans
[04:11:39.720 --> 04:11:43.000]  I almost always say Joey toucans, but it's Jimmy
[04:11:45.280 --> 04:11:47.280]  Like a mafia thing
[04:11:47.440 --> 04:11:50.800]  You know, right. Just want to go with the Joey
[04:11:51.400 --> 04:11:56.840]  Joey Joey toucans. No, Jimmy toucans blackberry preservation. And again, these are all
[04:11:57.440 --> 04:12:02.920]  Well, not all of these specific strains, but a lot of his work is available on the dog a duck garden site as well
[04:12:03.480 --> 04:12:08.600]  And you know, that's another one like you remember you were like, oh, yeah, you'll probably forget about one
[04:12:08.960 --> 04:12:11.920]  Yeah, that's one. Yeah, that's one of the guys
[04:12:12.280 --> 04:12:17.520]  It up fucking Jimmy. I got some fucking Victor fucking Barnes from the guy
[04:12:18.040 --> 04:12:19.160]  like
[04:12:19.160 --> 04:12:21.160]  You know
[04:12:21.600 --> 04:12:23.600]  He recently did a
[04:12:23.840 --> 04:12:26.500]  Puna lights Thank You rusty nail. He's talking about that one
[04:12:26.500 --> 04:12:31.720]  But I was interested in that because I've been kind of hunting Puna butter for a while
[04:12:31.720 --> 04:12:36.760]  I found one version from a company out of Hawaii, but it wasn't like the same thing that I was
[04:12:37.760 --> 04:12:43.080]  After but there's a in Washington amazingly enough there's a commercial
[04:12:44.800 --> 04:12:50.440]  Company that grows this thing called Hawaiian golden pineapple and it's a poota butter times golden pineapple
[04:12:51.000 --> 04:12:54.520]  It's just fucking amazing and it has a consistent
[04:12:55.880 --> 04:12:58.760]  unique profile every time I
[04:12:59.320 --> 04:13:02.600]  mean the unique as it's the same every time but
[04:13:03.440 --> 04:13:08.960]  It's so consistent it's amazing for commercial weed and I've had me golden pineapple
[04:13:08.960 --> 04:13:13.440]  I know where that's coming from and I know what that's bringing. So my only conclusion is it's this poona butter
[04:13:13.520 --> 04:13:20.200]  That's adding the magic to it. So I've been trying them like I got to get some tuna but the tuna no, no butter
[04:13:22.840 --> 04:13:24.840]  Yeah
[04:13:25.120 --> 04:13:26.560]  But yeah his
[04:13:26.560 --> 04:13:29.600]  Puna Puna lights and thanks for helping me there rusty nails
[04:13:29.600 --> 04:13:36.560]  It's the the Puna butter times the nl5 and I know what nl5 is gonna bring to the table
[04:13:36.560 --> 04:13:38.560]  So it'll be easy to see
[04:13:39.000 --> 04:13:41.720]  An expression if it is from that Puna side
[04:13:43.400 --> 04:13:45.400]  Oh, yeah, yeah
[04:13:50.800 --> 04:13:54.200]  So high yeah, buddy legendary
[04:13:54.200 --> 04:13:57.400]  Yeah, there you go man
[04:14:00.200 --> 04:14:03.520]  What's up, babe, we're gonna have an illegal warehouse or what?
[04:14:08.080 --> 04:14:14.440]  Oh my god, we just got to get it off one fucking time dude just one fucking time find the keepers
[04:14:16.280 --> 04:14:18.280]  The keepers man
[04:14:19.320 --> 04:14:21.320]  You a Bodhi fan
[04:14:21.320 --> 04:14:24.480]  You a Bodhi fan not really man
[04:14:27.360 --> 04:14:33.460]  You know, yeah, no worries, yeah, you know I just
[04:14:35.840 --> 04:14:42.440]  All good we could leave it at that. Yeah. Yeah. So that local sports team is kicking ass this year
[04:14:43.160 --> 04:14:45.160]  No, I'm just joking actually
[04:14:46.160 --> 04:14:52.640]  The Mariners they they blew it they lost Seattle will always lose fuck Seattle teams
[04:14:53.680 --> 04:14:58.560]  Except the hockey team. I'm down with them, even though they suck, but they're still cool. I
[04:15:01.240 --> 04:15:04.280]  Read it for my old Chicago teams the Cubs
[04:15:05.080 --> 04:15:12.240]  And the Detroit Lions long enough because though that my first baseball game was in Chicago. My first football game was in Detroit
[04:15:12.760 --> 04:15:14.240]  So
[04:15:14.240 --> 04:15:19.680]  So you are you from that you from that region man? I can you moved out west?
[04:15:20.080 --> 04:15:25.600]  Yeah, yeah, I lived in Michigan when I was much younger, you know pre prior to being an adult
[04:15:25.760 --> 04:15:30.640]  So as a kid, I lived out there and like that 70s show type era
[04:15:32.800 --> 04:15:34.800]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[04:15:35.240 --> 04:15:40.040]  It's funny cuz my wife is actually from that town. She's from Wausau, Wisconsin
[04:15:42.240 --> 04:15:44.840]  So we love that show here and we've got that show
[04:15:48.640 --> 04:15:50.640]  Fucking red
[04:15:51.120 --> 04:15:52.640]  D that's my dad right there
[04:15:52.640 --> 04:15:58.000]  Like I didn't watch the show when it was out and when it was popular mainly cuz I just didn't watch TV
[04:15:58.000 --> 04:16:00.480]  I was always out doing something but you know
[04:16:00.760 --> 04:16:06.620]  Having it on DVD where you can just watch them all like we've probably watched through the series at least a good ten times now
[04:16:06.620 --> 04:16:09.360]  It's just good to have on in the background and shit
[04:16:12.240 --> 04:16:14.240]  Mila Kunis
[04:16:14.800 --> 04:16:16.800]  She's
[04:16:18.840 --> 04:16:21.160]  If you're watching like you missed out
[04:16:29.760 --> 04:16:34.960]  And you done miss you miss you miss the shit not really you didn't miss the boat my
[04:16:35.960 --> 04:16:37.960]  You fucked up
[04:16:38.480 --> 04:16:40.480]  But
[04:16:41.920 --> 04:16:47.080]  There's there's still time right she can ditch Ashton Kutcher and
[04:16:47.680 --> 04:16:52.840]  And come back. Yeah. Yeah, I mean who would it why not? I
[04:16:53.680 --> 04:16:55.680]  mean, you know
[04:17:00.080 --> 04:17:06.280]  I could probably get like two cartons of cigarettes or him but you know
[04:17:08.560 --> 04:17:10.560]  He might be a cool dude
[04:17:11.320 --> 04:17:13.200]  He owns my space
[04:17:13.200 --> 04:17:16.720]  He bought my house. You know what he did. I'll yeah
[04:17:17.040 --> 04:17:21.040]  He bought my space for a while and was trying to bring it back. But that did not work
[04:17:21.520 --> 04:17:24.560]  What is the double line? Is that free born?
[04:17:25.440 --> 04:17:27.440]  Yes, it is. Oh
[04:17:28.360 --> 04:17:32.280]  Special packaging. Yeah, that's a good call right there
[04:17:33.120 --> 04:17:35.120]  That's a good call
[04:17:35.240 --> 04:17:40.040]  You see like jeans line mark it's like really fucking good like
[04:17:40.760 --> 04:17:42.080]  his
[04:17:42.080 --> 04:17:47.840]  So, you know you were talking about growing hemp and shit like that and we kind of segue nah
[04:17:48.120 --> 04:17:50.920]  So I moved to Colorado
[04:17:52.200 --> 04:17:56.640]  Working for a guy to grow ten acres of outdoor hemp
[04:17:58.560 --> 04:18:01.040]  So my co-workers
[04:18:01.840 --> 04:18:03.840]  right is
[04:18:03.920 --> 04:18:05.920]  Bob hemp L
[04:18:06.840 --> 04:18:08.440]  Hannibal
[04:18:08.440 --> 04:18:10.880]  Peebud Mike and some other
[04:18:11.880 --> 04:18:18.560]  They should be notable people, but they're not like on the internet and shit. So, um, and we're all working together
[04:18:22.360 --> 04:18:24.360]  Fucking killing it
[04:18:25.360 --> 04:18:27.360]  Oh
[04:18:29.560 --> 04:18:34.520]  Carry on no, no, no seeds are more important. This is seed show buddy
[04:18:37.200 --> 04:18:38.920]  This is my
[04:18:38.920 --> 04:18:43.560]  Mean gene work. I was excited to get started on but I
[04:18:44.120 --> 04:18:48.540]  kind of want to wait until I have a couple more awesome things in the
[04:18:49.800 --> 04:18:52.480]  Tent before I pop these and see what happens
[04:18:53.160 --> 04:18:58.160]  Yeah, I think like the moral of the show is like we need like
[04:18:59.200 --> 04:19:04.240]  we need to like, you know have more like traditional market warehouses and
[04:19:04.540 --> 04:19:12.120]  Like really just go hard and do like big Fino hunts and then like, you know chill before we get arrested
[04:19:19.880 --> 04:19:21.880]  Yes
[04:19:22.480 --> 04:19:25.720]  This one this one to God all of these are like at the top of the
[04:19:26.920 --> 04:19:28.920]  top of the list for me
[04:19:29.240 --> 04:19:31.040]  It's the runts
[04:19:31.040 --> 04:19:33.040]  times the gelato
[04:19:33.520 --> 04:19:34.880]  33
[04:19:34.880 --> 04:19:36.880]  times the cherry limeade
[04:19:37.480 --> 04:19:44.640]  You know, it's crazy. I was locked up in Florence with the rumps guys cousin that got him into growing weed
[04:19:45.400 --> 04:19:47.400]  Shut out the fucking P rot
[04:19:48.120 --> 04:19:49.680]  Yeah
[04:19:49.680 --> 04:19:51.480]  fucking
[04:19:51.480 --> 04:19:55.720]  But yeah, fucking the small fucking world man, and
[04:19:56.680 --> 04:19:59.840]  We had cell phones up in there and shit, you know
[04:19:59.840 --> 04:20:04.440]  If you were like connected up and shit and get it get a crack and you know
[04:20:04.440 --> 04:20:11.640]  You can't be you know, you have cell phone and shit. So I actually talked to those cats in prison
[04:20:12.440 --> 04:20:15.360]  Like through P rock suck at cell phone and shit
[04:20:17.320 --> 04:20:21.280]  Yeah, that must have been nice to have that conversation though
[04:20:22.320 --> 04:20:29.040]  It's kind of funny, you know, because like me and P rock like so P rock is like
[04:20:29.280 --> 04:20:34.960]  He's out of like watts and shit, you know, he was a tongo crip and everything else, too
[04:20:36.440 --> 04:20:43.320]  It's kind of weird but yeah, so like we were like fucking kicking it talking about growing weed all types of shit and
[04:20:44.200 --> 04:20:49.960]  It's like yeah, you kind of know like a lot about growing weed, you know, you're in here for fucking guns and shit
[04:20:49.960 --> 04:20:55.720]  I was like, yeah, I did time for growing weed too, but you know just happens to be like this guy around
[04:20:57.160 --> 04:20:59.880]  He's like cool and I was like
[04:21:00.960 --> 04:21:02.960]  You know
[04:21:02.960 --> 04:21:08.040]  To knowing one another like over the time and I was like, yeah, I kind of like, you know
[04:21:08.040 --> 04:21:12.920]  I ran like a seed company. I was like a breeder and shit made some some things, you know
[04:21:12.920 --> 04:21:18.720]  And he was like what really I was like, yeah, my name was you know, and he looks it up
[04:21:18.720 --> 04:21:23.720]  He's like, oh shit, man. I heard you I heard you through another friend
[04:21:24.600 --> 04:21:26.680]  Was like, yeah, it's fucking rad, dude
[04:21:26.680 --> 04:21:32.400]  So he's like so my people are these people and I was like I get the fuck out of here
[04:21:32.400 --> 04:21:35.400]  And we were getting all fucking drunk one fucking night
[04:21:35.400 --> 04:21:41.560]  I got a bunch of fucking liquor smuggled in and everything. So we're fucking getting all fucking lit and
[04:21:41.760 --> 04:21:42.680]  And
[04:21:42.680 --> 04:21:48.540]  He breaks out the phone like causes cousins up and like we ended up like kicking it for about 15 minutes
[04:21:48.640 --> 04:21:54.440]  Talking about breeding weed and shit. I never touched back in with them. But yeah
[04:21:55.880 --> 04:21:58.160]  Maybe that's the next collab man. I
[04:21:58.920 --> 04:22:05.600]  Already know what they're working on. It's like jet fuel AG fucking hybrid or something with the fucking roots
[04:22:06.640 --> 04:22:10.680]  Boy, so what are you trying to do? You trying to introduce gas with the fruit?
[04:22:11.560 --> 04:22:15.360]  Nah, I probably won't do it. I probably won't do it just because
[04:22:16.000 --> 04:22:18.120]  It's just I don't know man. It's just
[04:22:18.760 --> 04:22:24.760]  It ain't my wave, you know what I mean? It's not my jam. So yeah, like this is more of your alley
[04:22:24.760 --> 04:22:28.440]  Yeah, you got to be passionate about what you're gonna do if you're gonna commit that much time
[04:22:28.440 --> 04:22:32.720]  Oh, yeah time to it like I'm really I'm really about
[04:22:34.080 --> 04:22:36.080]  different, you know, but
[04:22:36.680 --> 04:22:41.000]  Like guys like that like I'm I'm really cool with like
[04:22:41.880 --> 04:22:44.720]  Guys that were like on some criminal shit. I
[04:22:45.320 --> 04:22:46.980]  Like that, you know what I mean?
[04:22:46.980 --> 04:22:52.080]  I like people that like broke the law and everything else that would push that bowl. So I
[04:22:52.560 --> 04:22:56.960]  Would totally be like hey man, like, you know, here's some pollen do your thing
[04:22:56.960 --> 04:22:59.680]  But like I don't really need to be like a part of it
[04:22:59.680 --> 04:23:05.240]  It's like, you know, this this might help your shit out. But like go do you you know, right?
[04:23:05.840 --> 04:23:10.820]  Yeah, I don't really need to be all all up in that all up in that shit, you know
[04:23:11.480 --> 04:23:13.240]  It's only so much time in the day
[04:23:13.240 --> 04:23:19.600]  So much so many projects you can be involved in and I imagine you have you have opportunities to to work with
[04:23:19.920 --> 04:23:24.800]  You know more people than there are time in the day as well. So we got to be selective at the same time
[04:23:25.280 --> 04:23:30.960]  Yeah, and and my thing was more like if somebody wanted to work doing something
[04:23:31.040 --> 04:23:38.280]  I was more into like the person themselves and like their passion for doing it. Like I'm more likely to say
[04:23:39.000 --> 04:23:40.200]  You know
[04:23:40.200 --> 04:23:47.840]  Somebody that's like just getting started learning the ropes like work along with somebody like that and help teach them and do something with them
[04:23:47.840 --> 04:23:49.440]  and show them the way
[04:23:49.440 --> 04:23:51.040]  versus say like
[04:23:51.040 --> 04:23:53.040]  some big
[04:23:53.600 --> 04:23:57.680]  You know commercial company that I would tell to suck my fucking dick
[04:23:58.440 --> 04:24:03.440]  You know people come up man helping people come up and maybe you know provide a better life for themselves
[04:24:03.880 --> 04:24:05.880]  Or you know people around?
[04:24:06.080 --> 04:24:13.120]  Versus somebody who's already got a yacht, right? Yeah. Yeah, you know what I mean? Like, oh no, dude
[04:24:15.600 --> 04:24:22.620]  So like another guy that I was locked up with in the same spot fucking spooks if you're out there man fucking
[04:24:23.320 --> 04:24:25.320]  outside brah, but like
[04:24:25.800 --> 04:24:29.640]  So one of those fucking big-name people it comes up a lot
[04:24:29.640 --> 04:24:35.200]  Him and his boys used to hold this dude up at gunpoint all the time and robbing for his fucking weed
[04:24:36.120 --> 04:24:37.480]  right
[04:24:37.480 --> 04:24:42.160]  Simply like on the regular fucking basis to the point where they were like, yeah
[04:24:42.360 --> 04:24:46.720]  When you are this like, you know save us the time like you're gonna bring us to leave
[04:24:47.400 --> 04:24:53.500]  Right and we can avoid this whole thing and that gave us like basically paying to like, you know
[04:24:53.500 --> 04:24:55.740]  Be growing in this part of the city and shit
[04:24:56.300 --> 04:24:58.300]  so it's just
[04:24:58.540 --> 04:25:03.460]  just kind of kind of fucking funny how it all works out, but
[04:25:04.180 --> 04:25:11.300]  But yeah, man, I said I'm more likely to work with somebody like that or you know, like old-time friends and shit like that
[04:25:12.860 --> 04:25:14.860]  You know
[04:25:15.500 --> 04:25:21.820]  And you know make something fucking like real different something with their what is that you snorting Keith over there

[04:25:59.780 --> 04:26:05.300]  Actually, I should probably call it here in five six minutes or so, but
[04:26:06.780 --> 04:26:10.580]  There you go, I mean Dave's still over there making it rain
[04:26:11.620 --> 04:26:13.620]  Like seriously Dave. It's hard

[04:32:03.580 --> 04:32:06.020]  I'm not touching that one either but uh
[04:32:07.460 --> 04:32:12.780]  Mind lasers. Yeah, we'll do it like the movie Robert. I'm like the tire
[04:32:14.220 --> 04:32:16.220]  Scanners
[04:32:19.420 --> 04:32:21.580]  Making me want to go watch rubber. It's been a while
[04:32:25.540 --> 04:32:31.860]  Well, we were talking so it all started like we're talking about like fucked up old movies back in the day and we go on
[04:32:31.860 --> 04:32:36.060]  the topic of gumbo and we were talking about gumbo and we're like
[04:32:36.060 --> 04:32:42.660]  yeah, it's like get into like, you know, really be rated shitty movies and a boy brought up rubber and
[04:32:43.180 --> 04:32:45.180]  I was like, yeah that wins
[04:32:50.420 --> 04:32:52.420]  Now do you have a
[04:32:52.900 --> 04:32:57.420]  Were you working on a soil project? I was and I am
[04:32:57.980 --> 04:33:00.300]  What's dude? I wish I could put a picture
[04:33:00.940 --> 04:33:08.140]  Yeah, it's it's spot-on. It's like growing like I used to grow like when I mix it, you know myself
[04:33:09.380 --> 04:33:12.340]  super high rates of fucking growth every day and
[04:33:13.100 --> 04:33:18.180]  Sending pictures back and little bits of data and people are like, holy shit
[04:33:19.980 --> 04:33:23.100]  Yep, is it like a water only soil or
[04:33:24.260 --> 04:33:30.660]  Probably could could get it off like that. But I do I do inputs but very
[04:33:32.420 --> 04:33:34.580]  Very minimal, you know, but
[04:33:35.740 --> 04:33:37.740]  Yeah, man, just
[04:33:37.780 --> 04:33:42.300]  Optimize things because like there's certain things I don't include in the soil base
[04:33:42.900 --> 04:33:50.420]  That I like to keep in my control that I write and put it like very specific times, you know, so
[04:33:51.180 --> 04:33:55.020]  yeah, yeah, it's like kicking fucking ass man and
[04:33:56.220 --> 04:34:00.060]  Probably around New Year's, you know, I just got a good in that thumbs up but
[04:34:01.020 --> 04:34:05.060]  So far so good. It just all comes down to that finish bud
[04:34:05.940 --> 04:34:11.860]  Smoking it and being like yes, this is yep. We're in there man. So
[04:34:12.740 --> 04:34:14.740]  it's the very
[04:34:15.020 --> 04:34:17.020]  diverse room and
[04:34:18.180 --> 04:34:23.420]  I'm also trying different lighting on this is my first LED grow ever and
[04:34:24.580 --> 04:34:28.160]  Cool. Yeah, man, so kind of doing a twofer
[04:34:28.820 --> 04:34:30.820]  Yeah, I'd be interesting to see
[04:34:31.260 --> 04:34:34.140]  What you notice, you know, yeah
[04:34:34.660 --> 04:34:36.660]  so far
[04:34:37.140 --> 04:34:44.540]  I'm really digging these fucking LEDs man. Like cuz all the heat that I'm not not generating man
[04:34:46.740 --> 04:34:51.260]  It's really cool not having all you know have you know blowing fucking
[04:34:51.900 --> 04:34:58.620]  AC in there, you know, right so it's been kind of cool tuning those rooms up according to that and
[04:35:00.580 --> 04:35:02.780]  I'm really liking what I'm seeing man
[04:35:04.900 --> 04:35:12.140]  It seems like I'm getting some like tighter nodal growth like in veg and everything but I'm getting very very
[04:35:12.460 --> 04:35:14.380]  very fast
[04:35:14.380 --> 04:35:17.660]  rates of growth, you know daily it's
[04:35:18.300 --> 04:35:25.260]  It's pretty cool, man. I'm real I'm real stoked on excited to see what the what the mud turns out like in it
[04:35:25.500 --> 04:35:30.340]  No, yeah, I definitely love the LEDs myself switching over to them
[04:35:30.340 --> 04:35:34.940]  I did notice that in winter that lack of heat was something I had to account for
[04:35:35.460 --> 04:35:36.460]  Yeah
[04:35:36.460 --> 04:35:38.460]  Yeah, we're already thinking about that
[04:35:39.460 --> 04:35:45.540]  My buddies like shit shack of a fucking house like we're hooking up a fucking furnace in it
[04:35:45.540 --> 04:35:49.300]  So we can produce some heat this there you go. Yeah
[04:35:49.940 --> 04:35:52.700]  Yeah, he bought he bought a fucking funeral home
[04:35:53.260 --> 04:35:57.260]  Which is kind of weird, you know, you would think they'd have a nice fireplace
[04:35:57.780 --> 04:36:04.620]  No, I don't like it was it was all meant for keeping bodies all fucking gold not stinking, you know
[04:36:04.820 --> 04:36:12.760]  So it's good for growing in the summer, but you know, yeah, it's weird man. I had all types like coffins and shit
[04:36:14.540 --> 04:36:16.100]  When I
[04:36:16.100 --> 04:36:22.900]  Living in Seattle. I lived in the Capitol Hill neighborhood and I was there long enough to see the funeral home
[04:36:23.340 --> 04:36:25.940]  Go out of business and get converted into a nightclub
[04:36:26.820 --> 04:36:28.820]  Like that was
[04:36:29.460 --> 04:36:34.660]  Interesting remembering saying, you know all the you know, the services and stuff there and then you know
[04:36:34.660 --> 04:36:39.780]  Hey now on Saturday night Friday Saturday nights. It's fucking glamour outside like
[04:36:40.500 --> 04:36:42.500]  You guys only knew
[04:36:43.780 --> 04:36:51.660]  There were corpses in there fucking so like the bros fucking kitchen used to be the the embalming room
[04:36:51.980 --> 04:36:53.980]  Yeah
[04:36:55.060 --> 04:36:58.760]  But it has these nice stainless steel counters everywhere, yeah

[04:37:03.740 --> 04:37:06.940]  and he sleeps and like one of the
[04:37:07.300 --> 04:37:13.440]  Rooms were like I guess people used to gather and cry together and shit and then
[04:37:14.140 --> 04:37:16.140]  Yeah
[04:37:22.260 --> 04:37:24.260]  I don't even watch family guy, but
[04:37:25.620 --> 04:37:31.740]  That I'm just picturing all that just the you know, I'm gonna go full hippie on you all the energy in the bias
[04:37:35.140 --> 04:37:41.420]  So my the room these let me is like this bloomer room used to be a fucking viewing room
[04:37:41.620 --> 04:37:47.500]  like so used to be a dead body in there surrounded by families of people crying over it and shit and
[04:37:48.060 --> 04:37:51.960]  Yeah, I thought about that too I was like man like
[04:37:52.660 --> 04:37:59.420]  You know my growing like some ghost weed and shit like that, but man these ghosts are awesome
[04:37:59.460 --> 04:38:05.340]  You know, like I have a weed so I can earn quick shit. So, you know, maybe they're like, yeah
[04:38:05.340 --> 04:38:10.080]  Maybe in death or whatever. We can produce a whole lot of life and some good times
[04:38:10.620 --> 04:38:15.700]  You know cast Casper OG coming out. Yeah. Yeah, man
