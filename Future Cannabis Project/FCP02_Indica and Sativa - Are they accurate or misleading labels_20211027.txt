future cannabis project o2 back in your lives once again this Chad Westport guys
how you doing thank you for joining us in chat and on the replay it's been a
busy day over here we've got a fun one and I see you guys already piling into
chat so that's awesome we've got some fun topics to discuss and we got some
great people with us here I know you guys know these people but I'm gonna go
around the horn still I'm gonna start off with my tie-dye t-shirt brother up
there to my right Spartan grown Spartan grown you know I see you in a lot of
places please tell everybody where they can find you I don't want to miss one
I'm gonna miss him for sure so I'm just gonna say the normal ones so Spartan
grown you can find me on Instagram first and foremost if you need to get a
hold of me you can find me on Instagram Spartan grown all one word no spaces or
I also have an email Spartan grown at gmail.com I'm a organic grower here in
Michigan at home but at work I grow at a commercial facility we grow
synthetically so I kind of see both ends of the spectrum synthetic and organic
and I can kind of help people either way I wouldn't say I'm an expert in either
one of those but I'm pretty good on both as far as where you can find me you can
find me all over YouTube I do a lot of these shows you can find me on you see
the cheap homegrown channel on YouTube I'm also a regular panelist with what
would Matthew here on cheap home grow it's called growing with my fellow
growers also on that is on Sunday nights at 7 p.m. Eastern time we have
Eastern time because that's where I live Eastern Time Times and then at 9 p.m.
Eastern Time I'm on the Michigan Bros grow show and those guys are like my
real-life friends like it's that's called the Michigan Bros grow show
because most of them I think all of all the panel members live in Michigan so
we're relatively close to each other we actually do events things like that and
it's all about the Michigan cannabis community and then the last show that I
do every week is the Grandmaster level show which is on new nights Saturday
nights at 9 p.m. Eastern Time so those are the regular shows and then I'm all
over other shows when I get a chance to pop in now you're muted Chad that's
awesome I'm I'm like trying to there we go trying to get all the cool little do
day name tag things going to know thank you for letting everybody know I know I
catch you in a few of those spots on a weekly basis so always enjoy that and
below you to the right I got my friends from the same state we're representing
out here on the west coast so we're gonna be using Pacific Standard Time
when we talk Cascadian grown and please say hello to everybody and let them know
where they could find you thanks for having me man the easiest place to find
me lately I've been kind of busy is Cascadian grown on Instagram but I make
various appearances on other shows too some some of them with Spartan every
once in a while Fumidor and the Flavors Operation Grow Show I've been on the
future cannabis project before I think both one and two now both channels
I'm probably forgetting some I've been on embracing organics there's the the UK
guys the 420 grow room I probably butchered it but yeah if you see me
looking this way tonight it's cuz I've got I got my new computer set up I got
two monitors and I'm looking at Chad over here so if you catch the side of my
face that's that's why I'm not tuned out but I'm reading chat and trying to
keep up with those guys too so nice yeah thank you for kind of keeping an eye on
that too I'm gonna try to keep an eye on that as well and and stay engaged with
everybody but chat tonight is definitely a night to get some questions in again
we've got some brilliant minds up here so we'll definitely get to some
questions and we'll want some questions and I know a person who gets a lot of
questions mr. Matthew Gates nothing I'll please say hello to everybody and you
know kind of tell us where we can find you both online and in the written form
sure so there's a bunch of places to talk about but the three primary places
you can find me I make a ton of content a lot of it gets posted onto my
Instagram which is at sink angel or at sink angel I see I'm reversed here you
can also find me on my YouTube channel which has got the same name as my
YouTube account in the comments and then all you check out the free content that
I make about mostly IPM topics so integrate pest management but also
various things related to plant health and that sort of a thing and I'm also a
writer a contributing writer for skunk magazine and I also have published some
work some chapters in various agricultural texts and things like that
which if people have questions they can contact me about and yeah I am very
excited to talk about this because I could tell that the reactions from
various people online have been complex
complex is a good way to put it you know when I when I put up the the post I was
surprised to see a lot of the response that I did so it was pretty awesome just
for the dialogue to already start you know and it started off pretty well I
actually have a comment that I wanted to read well before before we get there for
those of you who don't know what we're talking about tonight we're discussing a
paper that came out Matthew you found that one posted it up to your Instagram
page I follow you I saw that I'm like oh this is great but it was a paper and
I've got it there's a link in the description as well got mine right here
but it's a cannabis labeling is associated with genetic variation in
terpene synthase genes that doesn't say a whole lot but basically what we're
getting at here is indica and sativa are they even meaningful terms are they
outdated are they inaccurate are they spot-on what do we need to do there and
so that was kind of the topic here and you know the chat and on my Instagram
page you know there was a really good comment here that I wanted to kind of
just start off with because it might encapsulate a lot of the conversation it
was from 312 drew but he says what observation I've had about these
discussions is that people sometimes conflate chemotype and user experience
these studies examine chemotype but exactly how that translates into user
experience is a different field of study with a number of subjective layers so
science isn't trying to invalidate cultural or personal perceptions based on
experience it's giving us the tools to shift our perspective as to why and how
those experiences happen the way that they do so not a question but maybe
something to address to get people more on the same page and that to me kind of
is so true we were all talking earlier that there's a lot of different contexts
that you could use indica and sativa you know I've heard I've heard from read you
know consumers I've heard from breeders I've heard from people that work in
genetics you know Spartan when you're tossing around indica or sativa or at
least what what is one of the more common ways that you hear it or some
ways that you know of it being used so for me and I think this is kind of I'll
say Spartans answer this is Spartans answer to the indica sativa debate and
it's like stop trying to it seems like sometimes science is more into
proving everybody wrong than proving anybody right and instead of having that
kind of an attitude about it I just say flip it you know we have an established
idea of when it's either it's it's not a noun indica is an adjective it describes
something so use it as such you could use indica or sativa to describe either
the effect or plant morphology there's tags and connotations with those words
that describe it when I say indica or if I say sativa people who know those
words already have already preconceived notions of what those words mean but
they're all tied to either plant morphology or they're tied to an effect
so I don't say throw the baby out with the bathwater I say you know we can
leverage that information that's already known and use it as an adjective to
still describe it and not try to tag it to the scientific term sativa which
everything sativa I mean if you want to be scientific about it everything sativa
there there isn't an indica but you know that's my worldview on it and I think
it's the easiest solution to the indica sativa debate I think we really lose
something if we were to throw out indica sativa when their groundwork is already
there their groundwork is already set and says okay and what I mean if you
want me to go into detail plant morphology you know typically an indica
plant morphological accepted indica would be a broad leaf varietal it tends
to stay more squat and wide whereas the sativa tends to be a narrow leaf varietal
it's a long flowering strain rather than a short like the indica and it tends to
be taller and not so squat so I mean I why would we want to have a conversation
where we're talking for example about plant morphology and have to say I'm
talking about a plant that's taller than it has been blade leaves you know when we
could just say sativa and everybody in the in the room knows what the hell
we're talking about I'm a big fan of that fair fair enough definitely and I
know Cascadian grown you have done a lot of work and research on kind of like
genetic side and history of strains and I'm going back to like a lot of land
race type stuff how do you see the terms kind of indica and sativa generally being
used or at least most prevalent in your in your sphere those those two aspects
that Spartan pointed out are definitely the most popular I might actually be
outclassed here with with Matthew being here on the the history of cannabis and
its distribution and how that relates to morphology but generally speaking when
people are saying sativa or indica they're talking about morphology or
effect the classification of distribution of the plant has has come a
little bit farther than sativa and indica but even within those separate I
would call them subspecies and that's a totally whether they're subspecies or
it's a totally different like conversation but even within say if you
were to say it was cannabis sativa subspecies Afghanica which is like the
Hindu Kush region even within that population you're still gonna see what
we would call sativa and indica type plants there are narrow leaf taller
plants that grow in that region that have a little bit longer flowering time
nothing like a 18 20 24 week like you'd find in a tropical region but they'll be
12 weeks or 13 weeks as opposed to 8 weeks or 9 weeks so you'll still see the
variation even within the subsets of of the populations that are distributed so
it's still somewhat applicable but it's more pinpoint than it used to be when I
generally use the terms I'm talking effect but I understand when people are
talking morphology as well because that's it's kind of the the use of the
word that most of us grew up with these days if you talk to somebody who got
into cannabis pre introduction of what we would call indica's so if they were
growing and smoking in the 70s they're more likely I found to use those terms
in a plant morphology aspect whereas somebody introduced to cannabis in the
80s 90s and so on is more inclined to use it in a a effect sort of aspect and
like the marketing aspect yeah I've heard a lot of older heads say that
especially the ones that that despise indica's because they ruined the gene
pool or they watered down the high because that there's a difference
between being high and being stoned as well high is generally associated with
something uplifting energizing there's it's so funny there's layers to this
conversation but it's generally more sativa type you would say I'm high where
I'm stoned is like couch lock I don't want to get off the couch and I'm
hungry let's watch a movie not go take a hike like and that's more indica based
more broadleaf more narcotic as if it's more of a downer as opposed to an upper
like it's so you'll see that the old heads will have an issue with the
downers because they want to get high they don't want to get stoned they even
that terminology is different so it's totally fascinating to talk about it is
it's interesting that you bring it up but you know it's at least been in my
experiment experience it's predominantly the older folks that are just like man
those sativa highs that racing cerebral you know that's what they're looking for
and kind of to the effect of timeline in the 90s and when it was more used as like
a marketing term or description as you say yeah that that's it typically tends
to lean a little bit more indica I know at the shop I worked at that was the by
far the most popular counter was where's your indica's but we'll get into that
debate you know in a while is to whether that's that's good or bad but you know
someone who has put a lot of energy into this as well you know Matthew you have
been looking at this from kind of a terpene perspective as well with the
indica and sativa so how have you seen it used or how do you predominantly use
it in your life in your world and is there any you know IPM difference like
boy I'd rather grow sativas because they're IPM awesome versus indica's or
how does that play out for you I'll be honest I don't so like in a dispensary
setting and also in a non dispensary setting I don't put a whole lot of
credence and this is just because I'm really agnostic about the terminology
kind of like what Cascadian said earlier and also yourself it does seem like it's
so and also people in chat for that matter are pointing this out it's very
variable so I try not to I mean I've had effects that don't match up personally
with what I would expect and I guess part of that comes down to and I think I
even mentioned this point in your comments and in the post you made about
this upcoming conversation we're having is that you know there are people who
are going to have different physiologies and their reactions to it just like they
do for other you know medicinal products or various other things in life
foods and that kind of a thing so because of that I kind of just kind of
trust my own reactions and I might not even have the same reactions and in some
of the papers that I've prepared here I put in the in the chat but um you know
there seems to be a distinction between at least from some some people's
research they seem to make the clarifying point that cannabis grown
before a certain time period perhaps had a much more stable and perhaps is the
reason why people have this like cerebral or maybe like a solemn it like
quality to it like and then after a certain period of time you know just
about everything we have our hybridization of different strains
rather than hybridization of perhaps more unique geographical or region based
which also tended to have I guess a bit of a secondary metabolite cannabinoid
terpene profile as well I didn't experience that personally so I don't
really know but like I think of examples of people that I've met in the world
where like you know some people most people you know they drink coffee and
that has a stimulating effect on them however some people they drink coffee
and it has a depressing effect on them and that's a genetic that's got a gene
based factor there and so not even then like like a substance like coffee is
like known the world over you know as a sort of facilitator of like
communication and and and stimulation and that sort of a thing but it's not in
every context and I guess I feel like that's the ultimate reality to consider
and I have some some references for us to talk about during the discussion
that's a great point and I absolutely do know people that the labels and their
reaction are opposite and it's funny because the labels may be accurate for
me and 95% of the people but for this one guy I tell you everything acts
backwards and I got to be careful when I give them new strains to try I gotta
keep that in mind but and that kind of you know I'm seeing a lot of awesomeness
in chat mr. toad who's a frickin dude knows his stuff okay and he's put a lot
of time into the research so he's in there contributing you know I see a lot
of other awesome comments broadly versus narrowleaf just the kind of things that
you know we kind of here and one of the things that the study you know went to
say and it kind of may encapsulate what we're saying here is the point in this
study is like the vernacular labels sativa and indica not to be confused
with the taxonomic names see sativa sativa L and see sativa indica L are
routinely assigned to cannabis cultivars by breeders retailers and users to
describe the cultivars morphology aromas and psychoactive effects which is kind of
what we've been saying here however the study says it's unclear whether these
labels capture meaningful information about cannabis genetic and chemical
variation so therein lies kind of the delineation between the purposes at
least for for our sakes as we use it to describe like Spartan was saying
morphology you know if he has this you know great plant and he has seeds and he
sends it him off my way I'm gonna ask him you know what what does it grow like
because I have a short ceiling I like short squatty plants so in that context
it definitely helps the aromas I don't know I guess I guess we could go around
the horn here when you think like if indica and sativa had a scent I would
probably seem indica seem a little bit more earthy where sativas are a little
bit more sweet does that seem to kind of hold true for any of you guys and your
experience I would have said we're sour on that I'm saying like when I think of
sativas and maybe this isn't even a traditional sativa but diva would be I
would say I would attribute sour to sativas if I had to me too that's
typically how I like sour diesel is that not a sativa yeah so like that's the
when I think of sativas I think of that is the one that comes to my mind
just stereotypically spice like haze like hazy and that's like the first
thing that pops in my mind it's like that you don't get that very often
anymore the real beta-cariopheline heavy that's what I'm thinking of when I think
of sativas when I'm thinking of indica's I'm thinking of short squat so yeah
there's earthies in there but then there's also a lot of the fruits so a
lot of like your blueberry and you know I think it's just for me indica's is
where I would chase the fruit after I'd chase the fruit and then like if I was
tracing citrus and sour and and spicy I call it that's usually the sativa side
especially lemon a lot of a lot of the cities are lemon to me me too but then
you jump over to like a lot of some of the OG's and aren't those a little bit
more indica see we're already running into a problem with that well well we
got gas gas goes with to the city was too and that's I'd say oh geez got a
lot of gas too I don't know I would I would put gas more on the indica side
personally I would say knockdown strain more gassy strains like knock me down
how about me okay I got to explain myself here okay so there's levels of
gas right you got gas and diesel yeah gas and diesel is it too too different
to me to me where's that asphalt next to the rubber tire next to the rubber tire
that makes sense I've ran some some pure land race from
Afghanistan that smelled like a oil field on fire or rubber tires or diesel
fuel or all those kinds of aromas I've seen come out of like Mazari or I just
blanked there's another region right around Mazar that I had some seeds from
and it was like an oil field on fire it was it was nasty but in the greatest way
when I think of yeah sounds like a city was I'm I'm my mind goes to lemon pine
pine saw which I can't stand pine so I usually don't smoke lemon because they
tend to always come together but I like sativa so I have to really search for
the ones that aren't lemon pine I enjoy the pine I love the pine I'm happy and
I do see you know people in chat to alluding a lot to terpenes and smells
and that really is what this paper dove into it dove into is is there a
connection between strains that are labeled indica and sativa and their
terpene profiles so kind of as we're sitting here talking we're already
coming into you know friendly disagreements I'm like gas is a little
more indica to me Spartans over there with the sativa side and got sour diesel
down in the corner but no that's that's kind of what this paper was looking at
Matt and then can you you know speak to maybe a little bit of their their
methods or what they were comparing or contrasting there with the terpenes and
the labels indica sativa absolutely so well I just want to just reiterate the
title is called cannabis labeling is associated with genetic variation and
terpene synthase genes so the genes responsible for the synthesis of those
terpenes so the title was not like we were saying in the the pre-presentation
sativa and indica doesn't exist right that wasn't the title because that's not
what they did the very beginning here which I guess is kind of like a
versace abstract says that it do we already read this part analysis of over
a hundred cannabis samples quantified for terpene and cannabinoid content and
genotyped for over a hundred thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms which
are called snips indicated that sativa and indica labeled samples were
genetically indistinct on a genome wide scale that means that so they looked at
the genome of all of these samples and they found that they weren't really that
distinct at all they found that cannabis labeling was associated with variation
in a very small number however of terpenes whose concentrations are
controlled by genetic variation at tandem arrays terpene synthase genes so
there was still a little bit of a relationship for a couple of terpenes
which is which is interesting to me but yeah that's what they did it looked at
labels that other people gave it so that's not really a proxy for is this
concept valid or not and I just wanna you know put that out there in the
beginning and a couple things real quick for you know listeners at home or
the ones that might be going back and downloading the link of the paper in the
overview of the of the study that you just read there were a couple of things
that I had to have been like hey I can pronounce it but what's it being just
single nucleotide polymorphisms basically that is and and again because
this is very important to the study they looked at over a hundred thousand
of these things to get to part of their answer but basically what the the single
nucleotide polymorphism is but it's a variation at a single position in the
DNA sequence among individuals or the plants here in this matter so it's an
identifying marker that we're able to see and if snips occur within the gene
then the gene is described as having more than one allele and when you start
talking about genomics and cannabis and expressions you're gonna hear the word
allele because alleles turn on and turn off certain expressions so that's kind
of important to know and it just says again to reiterate due to the high
abundance of these in the genome snips already serve as a predominant marker
type so it's something that we can help identify characteristics that's what the
single nucleotide polymorphism is they did a hundred thousand of them and kind
of Matthew you already kind of actually covered this one just but genome wide
scale it's not a ruler it's basically it's an approach that involves scanning
markers like we just said across complete sets of DNA or genomes and many
cultivars and that's where you find genetic variations associated with
particular traits so again we're looking for something different in there and
just sorry to you know bore some of you people if you know these terms already
but one more is terpene synthase gene because we'll hear about that a lot TPS
is for short terpene synthases are just key enzymes responsible for the
biosynthesis of terpenes so they help make terpenes so just kind of to kind of
bring those back and I you know didn't want to sorry to cut you off there
Matthew no not at all wanted you said it better than I would have I think it's
really important to to break that down yeah thank you and and you were you used
to you did mention that there were a few correlations um they were not
predominant they were they were kind of weak but like sativa content was
correlated with concentrations of bergamot teen which is a I'll put that
up on the screen but this is a terpene that I'm not very familiar with and also
farnesine that one I've seen around both of which in part tea like or fruity
aromas which kind of we everybody was Spartan thinks those might fall under
the sativa I'm just picking on you Spartan I'm playing around and then in
the indica it looks like there was a constant or a relationship with myrcene
it was twenty one point two percent of those labeled indica or whatever matched
into it so again it's not like an overwhelming of like well yeah seventy
percent of the indica strains have myrcene so I thought that was
interesting and you brought that up so there there is a terpene type connection
but maybe can you elaborate a little more about how terpenes were used in the
study or importance there if that's even a question well like you know I actually
highlighted the same area that you're you're talking about here and yeah I'll
just cards on the table I'm gonna have to take their word for it if the bergamot
teen is like the bergamot like in Earl Grey tea or something like that then I
guess I would call that like herbal or tea like I feel like tea like is kind of
a cop-out turn a little bit because that's yeah the citrus has a very
citrus like aroma thanks a lot that doesn't tell me I don't know and also
what the oil filter does yeah well and also not all tea and on that point if
you know I drink tea and you know the bergamot is not that's a different thing
entirely it's not this external to the tea leaves right so even there that's
kind of like a I don't know it's kind of a weird correlation to make when we're
talking about aromas and terpenes and and and they're they're like direct
relationship with the plant itself I just think that's kind of a funny point
to make there but yeah actually going forward a little bit lower in the paper
they say that Hillig found that these three sesquiterpenes which are I think
that's pronounced we all are Guile gamma you does mall and beta you does mall
we're so stay with plants from Afghanistan which is considered
according to this person the region of origin for indica cultivars now I
believe that's also used and I have here the McPartland paper a classification of
endangered high THC cannabis domesticates from our and their wild
relatives in that paper which I can screen share some part some point later
on they talk about they make a big distinction between like cannabis from
like like maybe the 1970s and 80s and before that and then kind of like you
know modernity or localized maturity like kind of right now and I think
that's where that's coming from but I don't actually know off the top of my
head Matthew I have a question real quick on this original paper when they
were talking of comparing the labeled indica and sativa and trying to find any
similarities I'm gonna be honest and I didn't read the first part of this on
their method did they source this from dispensaries where did they get this and
you know who did the labeling that's yes being on the inside and seeing how
the labeling works that's my concern where where do the pitchforks go that's
a good question and you know I didn't highlight that part I don't remember it
off the top of my head but I can go into methods right here samples were
collected from Bedrock and international coffee shops so they just pick them up
there you go which which I suppose is actually great right it's kind of like
it's what at least the Dutch would interact with right and and I think that
you know it's a sort of a I mean that's functionally how a lot of people
interact with cannabis labeling right is from a dispensary that kind of a thing
and I guess samples had labels for hemp but they were excluded so I guess that
was also another cultivar that was that was possible yeah well I was just
concerned because I know at least here in the United States that the
regulations that we have to operate under and the systems we have to use
namely metric for one actually almost forces you to rename things and so I
mean at that point a label means nothing as far as like that's why I mean as far
as even yeah if you change this cultivar name then there's no way you could ever
check any heritage for the plant to see or check whether or not it is truly what
we would consider an indica or in any way so when you're starting out with
your samples unknown it's difficult to find any kind of correlation because you
you just calling it whatever and then when you get when you just call it
whatever and then you look up that string to see if this considered indica
or sativa I mean is it what it is that's part of what I found interesting about
the paper if you look at the extended data figure two I'm not sure what page
it doesn't have page numbers but when you look at the the names of the plants
that they have colored lines for they're all what I would call them rather modern
varieties there's not a land race on the page there's not a plant out of a
particular origin out of any of them I mean the closest they get to is a haze
and a cush and we all know that a haze is not necessarily a haze and a cush is
not necessarily a cush just because you put it on the label so I did kind of
threw a little bit of invalid and invalid ness invalid invalidity into the
paper for me there because what are they really comparing other than labeling and
the flowers and the jars because there's nothing actually from any point of
origin so it just makes it tougher
that's the point right that's that they aren't they aren't making any kind of
yeah they're literally not making a wider point they're just saying hey we
genetically sequence all these plants some are called able some are called
indica some are called sativa but really they're not distinct right and I think
yeah I think that's what the the ultimate search is for is if you had a
hundred cultivars like they did here but it was you know whether they had names
or whether they were blind taste tested to be able to put it into some sort of
testing system to come out with discernible groups of like this is you
know whether it's effect whether it's a name yeah like that who knows what's
gonna make it a smoke and then said okay that had a at least use the effect
and say okay we smoked all these samples and we agreed you know eight to ten of us
agreed this one was indica and eight of ten of us agreed this one was sativa and
then ran the DNA sequencing and tried to find a correlation I would feel much
better about it because you you can't you know again it's you can't take the
human factor out of it which the testing does and it's accurate in its
own sense but it you eliminating that human factor yeah like you said that
that's very important to the puzzle I think well like and some other people in
the comments had made some points about like narrow leaf dominant versus like
broadleaf dominant and like other sort of phenotypic traits I actually couldn't
I couldn't find the reference in time I had forgotten about it until right
before this video but like that's a pretty that's a pretty common one as
well to like to sort of marry indica and sativa to different phenotype traits but
like obviously if you cross that and you cross that again and you continue to
cross those like there so like cannabinoids and terpenes the genes that
produce those things they aren't like linked in any way to length of the inner
nodes or like you know the leaf morphology they're not linked at all so
there's no reason to expect those consistencies and I know that's really
popular but it certainly makes sense right if you believe that you can breed
two breeds of dogs together and get something that looks very different that
is you know then it's the same process the same concept right being cannabis
doesn't change that about how genes work well I kind of wanted to ask you know
Cascadian groan you know to where we're kind of in this conversation we're still
sticking we're talking a lot about effect or the perception value to these
names and going back genealogically very probably very few true indica's and
sativa's out there so how do are like hybrids or polyhybrids do you see
falling into this conversation or does it just ruin the conversation does it
mean that it needs to be wider or we just need better classifications again
for a variety of ways because nobody says their plant grows like a hybrid so
it's not really a morphology thing so I've got three or four points I've been
holding on to but to answer your question it's it's it's fascinating in a
historical aspect because a lot of the modern cultivars are depending upon like
we have this plethora of you can walk into a dispensary and there's a plethora
of names on labels and some of them are more related to each other than others
but all of this variety comes from a small handful of pieces of work that was
done in the late 80s early 90s and then they were picked apart they were like
you had this small cluster of different pieces of work meaning different
breeding projects haze northern lights etc etc and from that they've they've
picked it apart it's like it's like picking a textile apart you started with
one textile but then you start to pick the threads out and you end up with all
these different variations because you've picked this color thread out from
this color thread and you've like Matt was saying a minute ago you've you've
taken things that we would nest we would sort of correlate one way and put
it on a morphology that we would typically correlate the other way because
they're not they're not linked so it gets kind of messy but where we're at
today comes from such a small group of work originally that it's kind of it's
it's kind of difficult to use that sort of a labeling system in its shortened
form like you you kind of have to add more description to what you're talking
about because we've made it such a mess essentially we've or added such an
artisan touch to it that that we've been able to take this sort of terpene set
and put it on this sort of morphology where that wasn't necessarily the case
originally but we've worked with the plant so much in these commercial
settings meaning commercial meaning like Dutch and American work not land race or
heritage or heirloom work that we've we've kind of mixed and matched it to
fit what we were looking for which wasn't necessarily what you would have
found back then so it it gets more difficult for us now than it used to be
because we've finessed it so well I don't know if that really answers your
question but that's where my brain went with it no it does I really like that
answer because like everything cannabis related the technology advancement you
know the cultivar advancement and options have just exploded it's you know
it's almost when things are like a slow trickle slow trickle slow trickle and
then it halves and then it halfs well by the fourth time it halves you're going
from like four billion to eight billion so yeah things have happened pretty
rapidly I'm glad that you brought that up I like that and I don't want to cut
you off you said you had you've been saving three or four things I'm gonna
let you keep going man so we were originally it was 10 20 minutes ago now
we're talking in the paper in the beginning of the paper I think it was
Matthew was saying that they they they looked at all these snips and that the
samples were genetically indistinct on a genome wide scale and I often hear this
this argument that we have cannabis sativa cannabis indica cannabis but that
line right there says that they're all the same species put pair that along
this is a genus though cannabis is a genus but sativa is the species there
they're all cannabis sativa there's not a cannabis indica there's not a cannabis
there's there that genome
magnify the magnifying glass that they put on the genome they're paired with
the fact that all these different species can cross pollinate with each
other and produce viable offspring hints at the fact they didn't say it but it
hints at the fact that it's a single species and I've often heard people
debate that the the indica sativa ruderalis means that they're different
species and they're they're not so I wanted to point that out that this this
paper is backing that up even though that wasn't the point and they didn't
state it it is written right there in the intro another point I wanted to
bring up from an herbalist perspective when it comes to effect as far as the
effect that cannabis is having on the individual there's depending on what
what type of medicine you look into but specifically in Ayurvedic medicine
which is the original like traditional Chinese medicine came out of Ayurvedic
medicine Ayurvedic medicine being the modality commonly practiced in India and
it obviously spread out from there but in that sort of a health mindset
structure there's thought to be different phases in life as far as your
what's the word I'm looking for physiology is concerned and and how
things interact with you which is like part of the reason why milk is good for
a child but not necessarily like cows milk is good for a child but not
necessarily good for an adult and and every interrelated thing which to get to
cannabis is why for some phase of somebody's life they'll find a
particular type of cannabis with a particular flavor to be really good
medicine for them but then something will happen and all of a sudden that
medicine will not work or will cause anxiety or will didn't used to put them
to sleep but now it puts them to sleep some of that from an herbalist
perspective has to do with you shifting into a different phase in your life and
your physiology is changing and therefore the reaction with the medicine
is changing which is in my mind part of why it's so hard for us to label but
that's why we can all smoke the same thing and somebody will get up and go
for a run another guy will take a nap and the third guys in the kitchen like
part of it has to do with the phase of life that you're in and how that phase
of life is interacting with your physiology is it your stressors and your
diet and it it gets muddled because we're talking about herbal medicine
essentially here and you have to understand more about your constitution
is is what I'm hinting at here you have to know your constitution a little bit
deeper than just this is the kind of weed I like you have to understand the
phase of life that you're in and what's good for you in that phase of life and
that it might not be good for you in your next phase of life I just wanted to
point that out I wanted to point out the the species thing I jive so much on the
herbalist talk I lost my last point so we'll see if it comes back to me but if
that I think is really behind a lot of why we'll have different effects from
the same plant is we're in different phases of life we're under different
stresses were embracing different aspects of this journey and that's part
of why everybody's different that's part of why the impact is different and that's
why it makes this so damn difficult
I want to support that sort of point that perspective somewhat you know like
kind of like what I was saying about the coffee or like even with IPM you know
like you know plants you know let's take cannabis or another plant for that
matter it's immune response is going to be very different from seedling right
you know as it matures and up and up into maturity and bolting and in
citizens I'm sorry about the mic you know and it's the same for people as
well the way that we develop and you know genes get turned on and turned off
and certain certain cells you know kind of forget what they're trying according
to forget the name of the gentleman but there's a neuroscientist I wish I would
remember his name but he was basically making the point that like part of the
aging process even is kind of your cells sort of forgetting for lack of a better
turn a phrase what to do like how they're supposed to work essentially
and that's our degradation so I definitely agree with the idea that
like you know your phenotypic expression is always changing too and your
environment the environment right you know your genotype environment that
comes together very simply and that's your phenotype and so even with plants
that's good even with cannabis sativa right that's gonna be different if you
grow it differently different individuals are going to be different
from each other and of course what where they are in their age is even going to
change quite a bit so I definitely agree with that yeah and I want to add just
another layer to that too is a lot of this that we've been talking about is
thought to have all been regulated in our endocannabinoid system that's kind
of keeps the homeostasis for the body and we all know that endocannabinoid
system is where these cannabinoids work so through cannabis that that can kind
of play a role in those functionings too but I mean cascading and grown dude a
hundred percent I can't I can't I can't like kill Taco Bell like I used to man
like my body my body's in a different life stage right now you know even I was
a I was a reading up on the Yamnaya people sort of a Indo-European or
perhaps proto-Indo-European group and since you mentioned ayurvedic medicine
you know and the drinking of milk it's interesting to consider that some of the
ways we've been able to tell those lineages and the sort of shared
genetic ancestry with those groups for Indo-European groups of which there are
many is actually genes related to being able to drink milk and being able to
metabolize it as adults which I think is kind of fascinating since you had brought
it up so like you know cannabis changed on a genetic level as it moved and was
domestic not only when it was just moving expanding in range but also you
know sensibly through domestication as well and so were the people who were
growing it for that matter as they developed as they developed new
traditions and rituals and you know food resources and admixtures with other
humans but that's kind of a different talk but it was a really interesting
point and I'm glad that you brought it up I think that's you know again we're
kind of talking about people having to shift the way that they look at it or
the way they use the words because we've at least you know correct me if I'm
wrong but we've definitely agreed that yes they have purpose and yes they are
meaningful but they just have to be in the right context well you know Spartan
was saying morphology wise completely handy totally works for me right and in
really I think that goes back to and you know I know I know mr. toads in
there but you know India going back to where indica came from or where it got
the name they were short squatty plants in that region so that does tie back to
something concrete the you know lineage the breeder side of it yeah if you if
you don't know what the parents were how can you label something it's we
would always joke leafly is like ten guys who smoke a bowl and then be like
yeah I'd vacuum dude or I want to take a nap bro so and then that's how it gets
marked you know that's it sometimes if you read their website you might find
the same conclusion too but that's that but and I bring up leafly to actually
pay them a compliment though because probably I mean we've had a legal system
in Washington here for over 10 years now 10 years pretty much 10 years something
like that so we're used to leafly do you guys all remember the tiles that all the
strains would come on and it was all color-coded it'd either be like purple
for an indica red for sativa or a green for a hybrid they've moved away from
that model and it was probably really hard for them to do because most people
I'm no different we hate change so when it looks different we instantly are like
I like the old way better but they've actually they've actually like made the
difference and they've made the change and I think that's kind of pushing the
conversation further have you guys seen any other examples of trying to change
the conversation like that or at just reframing it what do you mean well just
moving away from the indica and sativa label whether that be through instead of
focusing on that particular name to associate with a strain we're gonna go
with a terpene profile but we're also gonna list the effects and those effects
may be what you would consider indica so like from breeders perspectives you
know breeders is one groups that could go away from it people making flour or
selling flour they could kind of move away from it and and that's kind of why
I asked earlier about high like where do the hybrids and the polyhybrids play into
this equation because I'm not even sure what really the right term would be
other than in the context of retail it's just easy to say indica or sativa
because people know I see I mean I guess chemovirus would be one example of that
okay I suppose yeah totally chemo bar is a new way to address it so for you why
why would you use chemo bar instead of like indica or what what is the
difference to you why would you use it alternatively well I think that a lot of
the debate if you can call it a debate is mired in you know like like you've
already said a couple of different things people are talking about it's a
different degree is some people are really keen on geographic origin which
in a lot of plants does relate to like different you know of course like
physiological adaptations and that sort of a thing for those who are familiar
with what's called a ring species or the ring species concept you get this
situation where if you have like a mountain you know let's say and like you
have an organism like a plant that lives on the mountain or that a population
exists on the mountain maybe the same species exists on the foot of the
mountain too or in the middle of the mountain or at the top but like maybe
the top in the middle can reproduce with each other and the bottom in the middle
can reproduce with each other but enough exclusion has happened you know
hypothetically that the top and the bottom can no longer the reproductively
isolated so that kind of stuff happens but bringing it back to chemo bar you
know like that's supposed to that's trying to sort of talk about something
that's more functional and is less this less interested in sort of a historical
or lineage approach to describing the plants that you're dealing with which I
which I feel like has a lot of great you know usage if you're trying to have like
from a medicinal perspective you know a certain kind of effect you know the
pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of those compounds in
your body you know if you can expect to have X Y & Z and that's what you want
you know it's what you need then it really doesn't matter whether it's a
sativa or an indica from the consumer level I suppose but you know for other
people that might be more important you know or less important rather.
Honestly it's gonna be driven by marketing it's already a business yeah
whether you like it or not so marketing is gonna drive the industry when it
comes to that so if if it gets to the point to where indica or in sativa
doesn't really mean much to the consumer it's gonna go away because the
consumers not gonna be asking that information and every square inch on
packaging is fucking prime real estate so they're not gonna fucking put the
shit on there if it's you know frowned upon so unfortunately it's kind of
controlled by the masses you know what I mean and I don't know I don't really I
don't frequent a lot of dispensaries honestly but I don't hear of a lot of
sativa indica even on the packaging anymore it's still like divided that way
in the case or whatever you're looking at maybe but I don't I don't know
off the top of my head a lot of packaging that really even is using it
to be honest and that's that's how it is kind of out in Washington is yeah it's
the majority of them aren't specific and again I joked about you know dudes at
Leafly smoking it to determine which one it is because we would you know we'd get
packages from different companies they wouldn't say on there and sometimes
they're like you know Bob's blue balls or whatever the frickin strange was so
we'd look it up and you know we'd have to take their word for it so yeah if you
labeled it an indica but Leafly says it's a sativa oh my gosh that's a 10
hour conversation yeah but hey it brings people together so I'm not mad about it
you know that's the best thing about this plan I think we can all agree that
you know besides you know I'm always gonna be the medicine medicine guy I'm
gonna bring that up the medicinal aspect of it besides that though it
fucking knocks down barriers and it just brings people together and that's why
it's so popular even when you outlaw it it won't fucking go away
counterpoint people get tribal about everything and sativa indica definitions
are one such thing yeah this is true in the nobody here is like nobody here is
like you're mad bro no you know nobody here is mad but hopefully not I've been
I don't think so everybody's hiding it well I'm high so I'm happy we liked it
before it even had names but yeah I'm sorry to cut you off there Matthew no no
I just wanted to say in that McPartland paper I've gone down quite a bit and I
have this highlighted part that's very relevant to I think what Spartan grown
was saying which is that you know that he was saying this specifically or you
Chad they say the erroneous equivalences of the vernacular sativa with cannabis
sativa and a vernacular indica with cannabis indica have appeared in taxonomic
studies and legal documents even the pages of nature have been problematically
adorned with sativa and indica accompanied by a version of this figure
here which I think a lot of people have seen of like the stout plant being one
thing and the tall plant being another thing from Gould in 2015 it's going to
say that those unfamiliar with the complexities and subtleties of
biological classification can be misled but in principle the issue is simple the
term sativa and indica have been employed ambiguously and contradict
orally and and I think that any definition that has degraded to this
point sort of lacks use and meaning right you know that's just kind of the
case and in the abstract here they even say that like in the path you know after
50 years of intragressive hybridization you know there's just it's just
obliterated this paper is called a classification of endangered high THC
cannabis and their wild relatives and or the domesticates and their and our wild
relatives and you know they make this point later on the paper where they say
that class reclassifying these terms these names is almost like an exercise
in you know renaming dinosaurs and and I think that's really poignant but also
important to point out that like call it whatever you want like I think that
there is some validity to kind of focusing all things being equal on what
are the effects that you're going to get and it's even like psychological effects
to count to consider to not only like your own physiology the physiology of
the plant and what it produces and how those affect yourself but also what kind
of mood are you in what's the experience going to be like I mean the
same sort of conversations about experience occur for people who are into
like wine and tea for example and like this will have notes of XYZ and this
will have you know a taste of ABC but you might lack the literal genes to
taste those things that's you know like I remember in high school we all like
got a little there's like a test to see if you had a receptor for and I can't
remember exactly what this but I think it was like the taste for like coriander
right or like celery seed or something we're like for some people it tastes
like soap right or kind of I think this is also true for like parsley and for
others it tastes like either nothing or it tastes but not like fine and that's
genetic right that's literally genetic and there's more of those interactions
and I think people give credit to so in some ways it's even removed from a talk
about lineage to a talk about how your own body is going to interact with the
substance itself and so if you know that a substance because of his chemotype has
or a plant rather it's gonna be it's gonna have these terpenes in it and
that's what you want then that's what you'll get and I guess in some ways
that's a way better and more precise way of going about things then sort of this
this sort of muddied sativa indica dichotomy I know you know I was just
gonna say I think it was cilantro coriander is the seed of the cilantro so
there you go there you go very embarrassing for a plant guy to say that
I was just gonna let it slide no I think it's interesting because I honestly I
think the big hang-up with these two words these days is is the community
culture we we've been assaulted at every angle lately and I think part of
the sticking point to this is we're just trying to retain some semblance of our
own culture instead of feeling like we're continually attacked from all
sides and we're losing everything we've fought for I think there's a certain
aspect to that I don't I don't know that people are often thinking that but I
think that's in the underlying current of what's going on here is that we're
trying to just as a community hold on to something that because this this plant
is near and dear to a lot of people's hearts that are in the heart of this
community and I think it's it's almost like hand in hand with some of what
we've self-identified with through the struggle that we've been through with
this plant and I think that's part of the reason we're we're you know beating
these two words to death is is to hold on to something that was what we've
grown to love through time it's it's kind of fascinating to me the the
cultural aspect in the the modern sense of the word not the traditional culture
but this modern culture we've fostered in the first world or in America or
Europe or I think we're just trying to hold on to part of that and I think
that's the hesitancy with letting letting go of some of these tidbits
these two in this case these two words is that we don't want to lose that part
you know we don't want to lose out we don't want to give it up we don't want
to lose ourselves in essence. I could tell you just personally for me is like
I don't have a replacement for those words give me a replacement I'm glad
they replace them but like I gave you example earlier when I'm talking about
morphology or even high you know I like Matthew it was a Matthew that you said
high difference between no I think it was cascading I was talking about the
difference between being high or being stone I love that it's fucking perfect
but yeah give me it give me another option and I would gladly take it but
another yeah I'll give you a perfect example I am a huge proponent of
anyhow I'm just hearing myself there I'm sounds better okay I make I'm a big
fan of I always say I make RSO and I say that because RSO is what's popular and
what everybody knows instantly what I'm talking about when I say RSO but truly
what I make is what it's full spectrum cannabis oil so FSC oh I make that full
spectrum oil is what I call it but I can't I mean if I say FSO or full
spectrum oil I just get you know blank looks yeah so it's like to me it's gonna
be a lot of that too it's like just to save me time I want to say one word not
50 to explain myself it's got has that you know you have to have the
explanation every time you say that word and when you're the guy that makes that
you're gonna have that conversation a lot very true repeated day in and day
out in dispensaries that's you know indica into couch yeah you know well I
mean that's what the customers are becoming and there be the ones that was
saying you know they'll be saying it the first one to say it you know what do you
have it's an indica and then you have to have the conversation are you talking
about the effect you know what what are you looking for you know is there flavor
you like and and just steer him away from it and that's not too terrible but
when that's how they have their understanding already that's you have to
talk their language yeah yeah no a lot of times we would get people come in is
just like I need something for pain give me something for pain give me your
best thing for pain to your to your point there's all kinds of different
pains there's muscular pain there's bone pain there's you know yeah yeah so that's
good and to kind of touch on what cascadia was saying there is almost like
a rebranding of the culture and we want to hold on to certain things and I
didn't really think about it in that context until you were mentioning it
because some of these things like we've needed updates for but there is a huge
rebranding of the culture I mean ten years ago we would be using the word
weed who nobody uses we all say cannabis now you know ten years ago none of us
were saying cultivar you know we're still staying strained now a lot of us
have moved to cultivar because cultivar is what it is so things like that we
kind of need but it is it's it's a departure from the history of what
cannabis has been for a lot of people so that's that's interesting that you
brought that up and and to answer you Spartan I don't have suggestions or
alternatives for those words I think they work in in that context you know in
the showroom context or in the grower context I think they still work fine
they work great in the scientific context the taxonomic context we you
know Matthew touched on chemo bar I see that a lot but then there's also you
know type 1 type 2 type 3 that's how a lot of it's being looked at but that in
itself isn't even complete or descriptive that just says it's a high
THC it's a mixed ratio or it's a high CBD low THC that's all type 1 2 & 3 does
so yeah the we we might need replacements but we're still calling
Brax calyxes so we all know yeah I mean when we say that yeah I mean I guess at
the end of the day we're talking about heuristics and the difference between
prescriptive ism and descriptive ism in language and I tend to not you know I'm
not totally one or the other I'm not always you know on the one hand I like
to have words mean what they mean and have that be kind of regimented for
clarity's sake I think there's a lot of great importance to that but at the same
time you know the ultimate point of communication is to you know transmit a
concept to some somebody else so ultimately a lot of times that take a
backseat if you're really trying to get if your true point of communication is
to transmit that that idea that concept you know all context being equal then
that's really the more important thing to target on and you know stickler for
you know syntax or grammar that I can't be for myself even you know I see a lot
of people in the chat making points that like you know like you know marijuana
used to be the word that we use or we like you said we'd used to be the word
or whatever slang term and now we say cannabis now we say cultivar but like
you know it doesn't make those terminologies necessarily like like
incorrect total in totality like words and meanings change over time and I
guess like I just feel like that's uh that's true for so many things it kind
of goes without saying a little bit yeah I don't want to ramble I did want to
point out that we were talking about chemo bars and and the types I just
blanked on the word that goes before that but type 1 type 2 type 3 that all
kind of like plays to the the effect side of how we use cannabis and or
indica and sativa but then we've also seen people try to institute like broad
leaf and narrow leaf drug type for the morphology side of how we use indica and
sativa and I don't feel like any of that's really stuck from the cultures
from the community cultural aspect I don't I think they've all been
lackluster like like you were saying Chad I don't think we have you know
Spartan was saying too we don't have the replacement word yet as a community in a
culture they've tried to push it on us but we've all said it's kind of hollow
and I don't know I don't know if that's because it really doesn't fit or if
that's because we didn't come up with it and we can't like own it you know it's
not from us I don't know I honestly I don't know who is us really right right
here I hear I mean like I've definitely encountered the perspective that anyone
who hasn't been hasn't wasn't born you know before a certain date or didn't
exist in the industry when it was illegal or whatever or wasn't like
putting their neck out that they are not part of the community I don't know this
is a controversial perspective perhaps but like that you like cannabis or that
you like to grow it or consume it or associate with it that is a single point
on your on your personality tree and it does not mean that you're gonna do well
with other people or that you are necessarily like you know gonna be
friends with somebody it does not mean a lot of things I don't want to say that
there is no community because there is a communal aspect to it and to a certain
degree if you if everyone says that there is an act like there is and that
kind of you know that kind of matters more right but I just feel like you
shouldn't just presume that because somebody's interested in what you're
interested that you're that you're part of it a sort of a deeper network
necessarily you could be but certainly that hasn't been my experience it's it's
almost speaks to the community of scale as well like I think you know we all
have a great community here you know we know each other from various places we
see each other in various chats but we're not spending two hundred fifty
thousand dollars on marketing ads this next quarter whereas you know it's like
who's really controlling the narrative because throughout history in a lot of
things it's been the small you know minority that's really writing the
narrative that we're gonna have to follow and that is something that we
eventually run the risk of in cannabis I know that you know it's a joke you know
it's my dream I think it's probably a lot of people's dreams here to have
their own small craft cannabis business one day and to actually start a cannabis
business these days there's no way none of the common it's not for the common
person and the common person was the person who was doing this in the past so
you know that that input or that you know that that that block of voting
rights is reneged because they don't have a big voice in the conversation
when it comes to that type of stuff I mean now that you bring it up Matt I was
trying to think when did that when did that idea of of your in your in sort of
community kind of start and I I think we're even holding on to that in the
same way that we're holding on to sativa and indica that we don't want to let
them go as kind of an ownership kind of thing and I think the basis of that
community type aspect goes back to before everybody was before it was
mainstream even even being talked about in a mainstream fashion there was half a
dozen maybe forums that you know before Instagram before social media really
blew up there was you know I don't want to leave one out so I'm not gonna name
any of them but there was a small select group of forums that basically had the
same core of people on all of the forums and they all kind of knew each other and
I wasn't even one of those people but I think that's where the the origin of the
community started was that all those people had all kind of vetted each other
and you made me think about it so I just wanted to bring it up it's I hadn't
thought about it like that before and it's fascinating but I think that's
where the the us kind of started and then it's just grown from there and then
social media Instagram blew up and now like prior to even Instagram the the end
consumer wasn't actually necessarily part of that community it was all grown
for us by us for us to share seeds with us kind of mentality and it it's
interesting I just wanted to bring it up you made me think about it and I think
that's where that comes from and so maybe we're even holding on to that
concept in the same sense that we're holding on to sativa and indica because
it's not by us whether it's the king of ours or the broadleaf narrowleaf like I
was saying I'm just trying to put puzzle pieces together here I hadn't thought
about that before I like that I feel like I'm getting echo all right well
like you're mentioning forum so you're talking about a like a post internet
time period or a post like yeah I mean like yeah people were talking in forums
like you're saying but you know humanity has been growing cannabis for at least
10,000 years or so and probably a lot longer and depending on your definition
of like cultivation that could be quite a bit research about the Amazon
rainforest I love to mention all the time seems to indicate that it could
very well have been quite facilitated by by people believe it or not so it's not
like an altogether totally natural totally like untouched by human
development certainly for still existed and predated people but just kind of
interesting to consider because certainly people who were growing it
during prohibitionary times various points you know various decades I mean I
know that you know this but like some of those people would kill each other and
still do you know maybe like a couple of hours from like the location where I
live and I just feel as though like again like I don't want to if people I
have met many people professionally and personally and I have grown to make many
friends in this in this industry if we want to call it this this community right
but I do think that you touch on a good point that like there's no like I hope
it's not controversial to say this but like people are not always gonna like
each other just because they both like you know like masonry or opera or like
like to play certain video games I mean certainly I have seen the the
tribalistic fervor of people who are upset that like one character in a
video game isn't in another one or could beat up this one or my dad can beat up
your dad like it's just it's egregious and kind of like you know we're in leap
in all at the same time it's crazy but I guess my point is that there are groups
of people who grow cannabis for reasons that are not super altruistic and you
know might even be actively hostile to other people and of course that's like a
small segment I think in the greater population but I guess it's an example
against the idea that people are necessarily going to be friends just
based over a shared interest in a particular thing yeah and I don't know
if like this is sort of a political question but like I don't know if you
would call that a community I've certainly read some convincing opinions
about what it even means to be in a society or a community or a or a
political group for that matter and you know not to like not to like open a can
of worms but you know people have been like ostracized for way less than that
and I don't know I just think it's interesting especially as an American
you know we have a very interesting opinion about nationality and and shared
community strength and individuality versus collectivism right so I think
it's interesting yeah there's you know and it's you'll find probably the best
community in areas that aren't making much revenue you know a lot of the
things that I've done in life have turned out to be great you know
skateboarding I skateboarded when it was a crime and you know now my buddy's
coming home with a $40,000 check because he won some contests Saturday in Vegas
it's an Olympic sport now you know music I was a DJ I was a rave promoter I
play it all over the place I mean look at Electric Daisy Carnival you know
these days Burning Man that those types of things so the community has become
diluted in each of those scenes you know bringing me back to you know to one of
my favorite well a political quote but you know it's like absolute power
corrupts absolutely and the more money you get in the industry just this
industry is no different there's gonna be some assholes and I hate the term but
there's gonna be some chads fuck I hate that term but I think all right you know
how does that make you feel did it used to be like Todd and Tiffany in my days
so we could go back to that for all I care but yeah I feel like there's never
a Matthew which I'm I am incredibly grateful for like oh you're such a
Matthew don't use that don't do that now they've said that it's gonna happen
anytime I see a bug don't be a Matthew don't be a Matthew get off my plans no
I just just to the point there there always will be the community again I
think we've all kind of settled into a good one but we are a bubble of the
bigger carbonated beverage so yeah we just gotta expand expand and develop
everybody in our carbonation yes yes I mean lead by example that's something
I'm always big on and you know all of you guys spend countless hours giving
out free information more than just free information that you've recited it's
information that you've lived and dedicated time of your life to and I'm
sure to the sacrifice of other things so that's that's a great way to lead by
example it's you you're trying to lift everybody up I know that's far far from
the beginning of our topic but I did want to say that because it's important
and that I think is how we will ultimately expand the bubble and when we
do maybe somebody will have a replacement for indica and sativa but I
think we all agree that it's serving its purpose still that's for sure well I
like the example I gave though I think it is just out of just naturally it's
adjusting you know you don't see it on the packaging as much it's falling off
you're not seeing it as much I don't think it's as popular as what people are
making it out to be and I don't know I don't have anything else to add other
than you know what I said before about I think it's still useful in certain cases
but it's being used less and less even just in my circle I understand I live in
a bubble too but I really don't see a lot of it you know I don't interact with
a lot of dispensary yeah I just don't don't do that so much so I usually see
on the cultivation side so I haven't really been paying too much attention to
that but that's interesting you know I I feel like there are sort of traditional
terminologies and things like even in like pop psychology right like you know
like alpha right like based on the for those who don't know totally erroneous
belief that there's like alphas and and and beta males and omegas and things
like this where that's not actually the structure of a wolfpack but because one
person reported it once in it confirmed a bunch of people's biases about how
hierarchical structures work you know now you have people saying like I'm an
alpha or I'm a type-a personality but like people don't use professionals in
the industries from which those terms come from don't use those really anymore
so but it's still conveyed but like I'll even you still use the word alpha or
I'll even still use the word type-a or type-b even though it's not a term that's
really accepted anymore and it's because it still kind of has a feeling
right it still has a meaning in that way even if it's not totally exactly
correct and I think that still has value as like a sort of a shorthand and I
think that can have value in certain contexts and so it stays around in the
in the vernacular right so I think that in that same way if we you know I guess
you could go one of two ways either Sativ and Indica gets totally abolished
or essentially it just falls out of favor or it maybe gets reinvigorated
with like specific meanings that you know change or something like that
perhaps even you know if we're able to find wild populations that are more
representative of some of these older older groups that seem to be more
consistent or perhaps through breeding this is possible I don't know maybe
that'll be maybe that'll be a way that Indica and Sativa becomes a little bit
more structured potentially I don't know what the future holds and they say
that everything old is new again so who knows really certainly I don't but I
think the the proof there I mean you would have to find a genetic difference
for that to be like the case right for yeah I kind of yeah so they would still
have to find whether they they they find a they find a fucking you know I
call heirloom varieties but landrace variety they find a landrace variety and
we'll say there's a genetic allele we'll say that they they can identify in what
they considered whatever Indica and then they find another one and it's you know
they identify a genetic allele then we could say okay there's an Indica Sativa
we can accept it but if it what if it couldn't find a genetic link then I
guess we would still be in the same boat wouldn't we or would we just say at that
point that's the proof and we can end it I guess science I guess like the the
desire to like quantify everything or most things sort of makes that
inevitable and necessary like I could imagine a scenario where maybe through
the marker assisted breeding and and I'm forgetting the term but like just like
through through standardization of those lines perhaps you know essentially if
people if people slightly change the terms to mean like kind of like what we
said earlier like Sativa has the traditional look and it has the
traditional you know aroma or whatever but if enough people sort of
collectively have that opinion and somebody decides well I know what I'll
do I will I will standardize two lines that you know a short squat one that has
these terpenes and these cannabinoid this cannabinoid ratio and I'll do the
same with this lineage and I'll decide to call them Indica Sativa you know or
I'll just call that you know that and I'll just make that the name maybe it's
a marketing ploy you know I could see that being something that reinvigorates
the conversation and in that way you know the sort of traditional phenotype
and actual you know the gene based traits you know kind of become one again
I can see that happening perhaps and maybe that's already happened I don't
know but I do agree with you that like it wouldn't it still wouldn't be the
same thing right it still wouldn't be the same exact thing but that's true for
so many things and in a century you know or two centuries or five centuries
maybe this is all gonna be ancient history I suppose I guess definitionally
it would be right it's gonna be no matter what no matter what yeah that's
already happened that's already decided right that's awesome yeah it's kind of
Spartan like you're saying there we don't really have a definitive go-to
markers in the genome that we could say oh indica oh sativa but it is kind of
just the way that it is it's what we've been using and accepted it and until
there's something else that can replace it we're kind of sticking with it just
down by association I guess in that sense yeah which still has that I think
that's still valid though like you know on the one hand I I'm very agnostic to
the terminology as they're used now and I don't think it's super useful but I
mean I mean in like a technical way right in a functional way which is a way
that I often do think and talk and and collaborate but I think it could be even
fun to sort of like standardize a group that way or I think that it's not like
altogether a bad move to like kind of like what Spartan was saying like if
you're having a sativa if you say that sativa means these physical
characteristics and you're able to map it out right they can still be a great
way to like say a lot of things very very simply and very quickly even if
that doesn't match up with like I was saying earlier sort of geography or like
true origin or like true like genetic heritage and yeah we do see that with a
lot of plants and a lot of words so I would not be surprised if things go that
way and I just think we were kind of talking about this before the show I was
just talking about cannabis in general in the industry and one of the reasons
I love it so much is that really we are in my eyes are on the cutting edge of
things right now we are pushing the science in areas that there's really no
investment in because when it comes to when it comes to just you know home
growing at a smaller scale or even in a larger scale this is a higher value crop
and so there's money available to invest in you know higher ticket items
if that's you know gonna make it better for the either the outcome of the crop
or the farmer itself and so I really feel like that our industry right now
cannabis farming cannabis or all of Canada I don't want to say farming
cannabis but all of the cannabis really pushes science right now we're really
pushing science and you're seeing a lot more in the fungi side of things you're
seeing a lot more in soil science especially organic soil science kind of
things more interest than there ever was before and it's big I a hundred percent
think that it's from you know I guess I'm biased but it's from the push of you
know the green rush you know it's the cannabis because you know who's coming
to these conferences these cannabis conferences all these cannabis farmers
are sitting in these conferences with you know Dr. Erlene Ingham may be talking
or you know all these professors that are usually sitting there talking to
students or peers in their field are now talking to cannabis farmers and usually
you just don't farmers don't have access to that kind of knowledge they just
don't they don't have the time or the or the money or you know a list of other
things you know to do before getting some knowledge so we're gonna run into
situations like this where yeah we're gonna have to change the way we say
things as the science catches up but that's the exciting part we shouldn't
like push away from it we should I think really embrace it as the science comes
and actually proves you know either us right or wrong we should just embrace
that and keep you know forging ahead for everyone because it spills over to
everything man you'll see you know I smile when I go into a supermarket and
see little mushroom kits to grow your home gourmet mushrooms I don't care that
their home gourmet mushrooms and they're not magic mushrooms you know what I mean
I think that's great because mushrooms are great protein source and you're not
killing anything to eat it I think it's it's wonderful and so I think it just
spills over into life in general and makes you know once you learn about
living soil and things like that and learn that you can feed yourself with
you know pretty pretty much little effort on your own part once you get
your soil built up there's a lot of effort to get to that point but it's
like the best way I can describe it it's like finding the key to a chain that you
had around you that you didn't even know was there until it broke loose and it's
like wow I am so free right now I don't want to bogart the conversation but I
just wanted to put a little point there I really like what you said Spartan
because you know I'm an advocate of the regenerative agriculture movement
personally and sustainable you know when I introduce people to the concept of IPM
I say that I practice holistic IPM and I really mean it it's not just a marketing
gimmick right like ideally you're doing things that are sustainable when you're
growing and ideally you know you're looking at the interactions that we are
and like various microbiologists and ecologists and entomologists and botanists
and mycologists and evo-devo people and all these sorts of groups of folks you
know are using like you know scientific methodologies to find out some really
intricate and amazing interactions that are super relevant to sort of what I
think a lot of people might popularly associate with sort of a traditionalist
maybe even sort of in some cases a bit of a Luddite perspective on on new
technologies and information and I don't I don't see why I like this isn't shared
by everyone you know certainly in the regenerative agriculture space but I do
feel like sometimes I do receive a bit of a pushback in in sort of the sense of
like why are you trying to quantify everything why can't why can't microbes
just be microbes and why can't I just like you know harvest the IMO or
whatever why do I have to consider all these variables but because it's there
they're there whether you decide to acknowledge them or not and that's just
the truth of it and it doesn't have to be an enemy you know antagonistic
interaction you know what I mean I don't know what you guys think about that but
I'm curious your thoughts it doesn't always have to be something that
everybody participates in either I mean we know that this plant is a weed and it
will pretty much grow itself with you know just a little bit of love but
there's also people who want to drive the racecars you know and this gets more
into like the commercial setting and if you know if I was able to maintain my
VPD a little bit more exact I might wind up with let's just say five more grams
per plant well okay to me in the end of the day that doesn't really mean a whole
lot so maybe I'm not so interested in VPD or I might say you know hogwash
never used it don't need it but to the commercial scale where you may have a
thousand plants that extra five grams per plant that's five thousand extra
grams which is a big deal but the principle that applies there it's the
same one that applies in my tent so to your point some people you know might be
like why do you need to know this or who really cares or I grow you know good
enough weed it's like that's cool and that's fine and nobody's knocking on
your door telling you to change but there are other little things that you
can tweak that done on a large enough scale and Spartan grown you could
probably speak to this it makes a big difference because you've you know you
work at scale again if you if you were able to get you know five extra grams
off every single plant in in the facility there that would probably be a
big difference for you guys yeah we are bonus by our yield so for sure you know
I mean I think that's awesome by the way I don't want to toot my company's
own horn but what a great idea by the boss to bonus every employee for the
bet you know the better result of course the measuring yeah now everything is so
huge basically yeah it's a hundred percent what it is and it's like instant
profit sharing and you know I think it's just so great because I care and it's
great to work amongst people who care as much as I care you know what I mean
but yeah for sure so everybody's gonna want to make sure that yeah if there's
something we can do to increase the output of course we would want to do
that why wouldn't we we just we always are because we're smaller the only way
we can compete is with quality so you know we don't want it even if it's a
even if it's an increase in you know five grams or whatever if it decreased
our quality we wouldn't make that sacrifice so that's kind of our metric
so as long as quality's high yeah let's keep doing what we're doing and try to
increase yield but as soon as that quality starts to suffer then we got to
do something else because we want to keep the quality yeah quality over
quantity that is the probably the defining factor of success for craft
because you're not competing at scale you can't compete on quantity with that
price wise just not possible yeah yeah 100% I'm curious Cascadian you know that
wasn't it wasn't totally rhetorical question but no pressure but what do you
what do you think about that on the like I guess if you want to call it like
science but like techno like like there seems to be like a primitivist motion
one way or you know and and a perspective that is totally mutually
exclusive with like you know like a genetic like like what I'm kind of
saying about like but like the genes of the cannabis and that sort of thing and
I don't think that you have the perspective that they're intractable
but like do you do you come across that a lot you know personally do you feel
like there's people like the regenerative agriculture space or
associated sort of perspectives about sustainability that sort of contradict
or hostile towards like technological innovation or quantification of certain
things that traditionally haven't been yeah definitely there's I think there's
people that I and I've definitely seen this that there's there's people that
think that as long as the process works that they don't need to understand why
that's not that bugs me that's not how my I need to know why part of me is is
knowing why makes me remember how it works and it's it's integral to me but
there's definitely people that just would rather have the process know it
works and then leave the rest of it alone leave the details to somebody else
I don't know if that's because it's not maybe it's not their passion maybe it's
not their their goal isn't to understand the why it's just to get to the end of
the process and maybe that the end process is more important to them I
haven't tried to pick apart the nuances of that but I've definitely seen people
that that prefer to just give me the SLP tell me that it works and let me go do
it and I don't need to know the nitty gritty details and the whys and the
hows I just need to know that it's gonna work and I've definitely seen that
particularly in the the region ag space they just they tell me it works show me
how it works let me work it and you can keep the rest of it but for me I
personally need all the details and I thrive on the details and the what's in
the house and the wise and I find it fascinating and if I find it fascinating
I become more passionate about it but I not everybody's wired like me and like
you I suppose so it's interesting that there are to me that there are people
out there that just want to know that it works they want to know how it works and
they want to do it and they don't care about the rest of it because I can't
think like that I can't turn the why and the how off I'm always worried that I'm
doing it better or something to that matter
there's a NASCAR driver and I don't watch a lot of NASCAR but you know he
said something to the effect of you gotta have mechanical sensitivity like
knowing how a car even if it's not like in great detail but knowing how your car
works allows you to be a better driver and I feel like knowing how your plant
works or how the microbiome works or all these various complexities about the
world or about the soil microbiota or whatever work which is why I love
ecology and I apply those principles to IPM because they are in a lot of ways
very related but it doesn't mean that you have to and certainly people have been
growing cannabis for like I said over 10,000 years so necessary
probably isn't the right word to use but certainly can be useful at least
having a little bit of that in the back pocket and I'm excited about seeing a
lot more of that in the cannabis space I'll be the first to acknowledge that
like I went to college but I never graduated from college and I never
really had a huge like I want to say books book background as far as a degree
goes but just my passion for cannabis and organic growing and all that I
learned so much just because I was interested in it and it's amazing just
like what you're saying here Matthew is how it can transfer across your
knowledge like for example I was reading an article today and they were talking
about Alzheimer's which is one of my greatest fears in life is I do not want
to get Alzheimer's because I saw what it does to people I've had a grandmother
with it so and they were talking about with Alzheimer's you get plaque
formation on your brain and it blocks the proteins and that's what starts the
prop the issue and because of shout out to Brandon rust who's also on the show
that we do together the growing with it for the growers how his work with you
know amino acids using amino acids to feed the plant in place of nitrogen
because it's the building block of nitrogen is the amino acids so these
scientists in this case to bypass instead of to try to remove the plaque
or whatever or attack the plaque like a lot of these medications are they're
trying to bypass it leave it there and bypass it by still feeding proteins
through you know acids instead and they've they've got a complex of amino
acids now it was something seven are seven or something that they patent of
course but they say that in mice at least it completely it didn't like cure
Alzheimer's but it stopped the it stopped it stopped it from the
degeneration so but I my my uneducated mind still understood the whole entire
article and was like of course that's gonna work it makes complete sense
because the amino acids is what it needs to make the protein so I just thought
that was cool you know cool it kind of goes with what you're just saying it's
awesome how those things connect and you know I hear a lot about or a lot of the
connections between personal health with the gut biome and the soil biome as well
you know just kombucha is the perfect example everybody loves kombucha oh yeah
absolutely right I'm you know I'm amazed at the sort of the maybe amazing the
right word because like you say Spartan it kind of makes sense the first time I
was introduced to something called the the hollow genome theory the high I
always forget is the hollow biome or the hollow genome I think it's the latter
theory of evolution I was like oh yeah duh that totally makes sense the idea
that like you know you've got the microbes in and around you and then that
that branches out to associating with more and more things so you've got the
gene you got those genes in some in a cell those cells are in tissue the
hierarchy of life right those tissues make up an organ those organs make up a
body those bodies make up a population okay and then many multiple populations
make a community and then multiple communities make up a biome and you know
it just expands out right and duh like that of course makes sense to me and so
not to be reductionist but that's why I like I find that anyone who follows my
post to know that I've been on a sort of a warpath about talking about genes and
you know their resistance to pathogens and how the immune system functions and
how like you know sometimes people make I think oversimplified claims about how
certain things work when in reality it's like what we said about the you know the
genes and how that physiological context changes how you're gonna how the
smokes gonna go it changes what foods you're gonna be into and also for that
matter there's other little edge cases right like you might have all of the all
of the genes you need to enjoy that barbecue sandwich but if you scald your
tongue you're not going to be tasting them right so like even even with that
all said like there's still things that can happen to complicate things you know
you just got to find out what works to to like put the shoe on the other foot
here I have purposefully exploited people's passion and cannabis to start
teaching them gardening or like like cultivation of food or the gut
microbiome or you know personal health or herbalism or I've totally played on
on people's I went on a rant on potent panic show which is another show you
you'll find me on once in a while a couple weeks ago maybe a month ago and
about how cannabis is like the gateway to to a healthier lifestyle and it's a
gateway to to being able to understand how how you really fit into the ecology
around you and how you're really not as excluded as you might think you are and
how these other soil health and the weather outside and what else you put in
your body and on your body and the clothes you wear and how you think and
how this all really like plays together and cannabis is just the gateway into
getting people to to live a healthier life and a more meaningful life it's not
just about health but it's also about purpose and I have open I'll say right
here I've openly exploited people's passion and cannabis to start teaching
them these other aspects to try to make them a more holistic person it's not for
me but to try to make them understand their place in in life in a more
holistic sense and I have I have no shame in doing that and trying to help
people through understanding that using their passion with cannabis to do it
it's been a lot of fun so you're a manipulator in a good way
actually yeah that's all communication kind of when you really get back to it
genetic communication sonic verbal communication you know that I'm having
right now with all of you I'm putting I've had people I'm actually I'm excited
when people comment on my post I mentioned some philosopher like Daniel
Dennett or somebody talks about like cognition and all of this cool stuff
people be like oh he's a bore you should read these people like wow I can't believe
people actually have an opinion on that but you know this kind of stuff is crazy
to me and it's the idea that like I'm putting a concept in your guys's head
and also the heads of everyone who's watching currently whether they agree
with me or not like that seed already got in there you know that little spore
that little thought spore you know got in there and at the end of the day all
communication is like that it's like kind of like we say about technology you
can use it for good or you can use it for bad but it's not inherently one or
the other you know it's how you use it and and I'm really happy and I have to
agree with you I myself do the same thing that you do I exploit people's
passions in you know for example cannabis growing and talk about well
what about homesteading well what about you know think of yourself as the immune
system what are you gonna do if there's a pathogen what about personal fitness
what about situational awareness you know things like that so I definitely
empathize with that chronicle chronicle cultivation in chat says learning about
growing weed resulted in the best tomatoes I've ever tasted there you go
so true though I smoke weed and then ate a tomato that he grew himself and I bet
you it was mind-blowingly good smoked out of the tomato and then he ate the
tomato man fry greed now okay I'm getting dumb carry on carry on I have
done that with an apple I have smoked out of an apple and then ate the apple
oh yeah guilty yeah so I mean yeah I mean I think we had a really great
conversation I can shut down the conversation by any means hopefully by
saying that but um yeah I've been enjoying the chat do we have any like
questions from chat I'm curious personally I have not been following
that much yeah no hopefully it's been more kind of running commentary we'll
give them a you know a couple minutes here to get some questions in I know
we'd love to answer them but to your point yeah this has been this has been
like a perfect arcing conversation we set out to you know maybe handle one
thing and then cover a bunch of other things but I think honestly the way that
it went was perfect and I love that on multiple occasions from multiple people
I've heard the words I've never thought about it like that but that's a
beautiful thing and I I know I said it a couple of times here and that's you know
that's all we ask and you know all the input from chat they've been right along
with us so it's been a great conversation guys I really do appreciate
your time and bringing your knowledge and experience here today to to share
with all of us so let's see I have a question for greens goddess if you if
you if you allow where did the origination of the word Sativa and
Indica come from and actually I I have an answer to that I have no way to
confirm whether it is the answer to it but in that McPartland paper actually
highlighted a little little part here I can go find it well you guys talk while
I find it yeah yeah while you dig when I was in school for my whole herbalism
trip I was told a story about the origins of Sativa it didn't include
Indica but Sativa or Sativum or any variation thereof that's used as a
species name for quite a few plants I was told a story about I would have to
look up the specifics so I'll just be kind of general here but I was told this
the story of a monastery and it was a comparison between Sativa and vulgaris
and the monastery had a garden had an herb garden this was in the era of when
well one of the many times that herbalists have been persecuted and and
they were trying to stomp out the knowledge and and Sativa was applied to
the the plants that were grown in the monastery garden they were they were
actually cultivated which it means cultivated Sativa in the garden
purposefully for medicine or I mean even the even the herbs that we put on our
food are are medicinal in nature but those ones were were designated with a
Sativa type marker and the ones that grew outside of the monastery that
didn't necessarily need cultivation were given a vulgaris designation so they
they were uncultivated they were they were wild they were native where the
cultivated ones Sativa were in the monastery and that always stuck with me
because I found it fascinating that what would it have been like to have been the
monk in the monastery cultivating the herbs knowing that there's people
outside of the monastery dying for their herbal medicine and here you are just
cooking up a name for these plants in secret while you're also cooking up a
name for the ones growing outside of the monastery that have to do with the
vulgaris or vulgar designation which turned into a lot of the species names
in the genuses so what about the open pollination between the two what was that
called well they were different plants they were they were completely different
yeah okay we got the I see an IPM question here we got sent it all in the
house so we get that in spinosad for spider mites yeah I just replied to that
I would say be careful because spinosad or the spinosins that make up the
product they can be systemic in some plant tissues and we really don't know
or at least I don't at the top of my head whether that's going to be the case
for cannabis you might not want that you don't want that reaction is this here in
tomatoes for example this is the case I want to jump in and just say in Michigan
it's on the ban list okay as far as commercial goes so I would just if it's
banned commercially don't use it and I will add that it's organic organic and
banned I'm just gonna say those two words can go in the same sentence that's
actually a really good point too just like organic and I don't know name of
poison a lot of people take that for granted though so I always like tossing
that one out there and and here's the question that we've talked two hours
without really even mentioning its name that might make the heads explode but
we're we're ruderalis in the indica sativa side of things are we just like
okay we don't even see you ruderalis you're not in the conversation yeah yeah
that's a good I think that certain botanists that are not me because I'm not
a botanist have just have said that that it's not really you know they've either
subsumed that into another group entirely you know like this McCartney
Partlin paper describes like I think it was six different groups I don't think
any of them were ruderalis but I don't know what you guys think about that I
actually don't remember the entirety of that saga I'm gonna filter it through
the my own Spartan lens and just go right back to my original answer and say
ruderalis doesn't matter if it's ruderalis to me I'm using the indica
sativa as only an adjective only and I use it only as an adjective to describe
either an effect or to describe plant morphology so I would just say I would
use it the same whether it's ruderalis or anything else here's here's an
interesting topic from Gorski again I think the ultimate answer is gonna boil
down to the endocannabinoid systems of people are different so you might not
ever get a true uniform curve but there is power in numbers so if 10,000 people
do something like this and then 9200 have the same effect then that could
help you steer direction maybe do you guys have any thoughts on this basically
kind of real-time effect feedback that maybe people can look into did you kind
of get the question yeah I think sorry I think the only way you can make that
work would be if you could control the supply and keep it the same that's a
huge point biggest problem right now in our industry that's not something
consistency right yeah no like my blue dream will be different from your blue
dream will be different from his blue dream even though we're all qualified to
grow blue dream good point okay yeah I mean it's still possible you don't throw
it I mean it would have to be localized so it'd have to either be by dispensary
or by cultivator and then they could tie their cultivate so say a cultivator
decided which I don't know what that does but I'm sure there may be one a
cultivator decided to always grow one single string and always have it
available then they could they could make sure that you know a dispensary
would always have a consistent supply of that flower and then customers could
give feedback and they can build the database absolutely but until you have
somebody that would I mean I don't know what I would report would require it
require like contracts and like guarantee I'll pay you this prop so we
would make this investment I don't know of anybody doing that but maybe if
there's a hype strain or something a lot of yeah a lot a lot of moving parts I
get it I mean there's companies like again all well there weed maps I'll use
their website there's a lot of websites that do you try to track these things
and they keep the metrics on it and it's all big data for them but yeah something
that has a true bite to it is different like you were saying so so many
variables question Oh keep going Cassian Oh to the root of Rallis question I
don't know how it fits into indica and sativa but I know root or Alice has a
textbook definition so I went and pulled out this botanical Latin from William
Stern just to figure out what the actual botanical definition is and it says
root of Rallis growing amongst rubbish and and I think it's interchangeable
this one actually says root of Rallis but root of Rallis would be the same thing
root of Radham would be the same thing rubble rubbish dump ie waste ground
which you know I've heard a lot of people refer to cannabis the root of
Rallis cannabis as ditch weed so not that that's any sort of answered in
indica sativa but I thought I'd pull out the book and get the answer while we're
here yeah that's actually I think an ecological term originally like a like
a root or all you know like a like in a succession area perspective when you
have like a landslide or something or if you have something that can grow and
sort of like like you're saying like rubble like conditions yeah the
McPartland paper does go over this that I had mentioned earlier they say that
the wild type variety has nomenclatural issues regarding cannabis sativa
varieties spontanea and cannabis root or Alice this has valve love and Genchis
Genchis ski assigned these separate taxes to the same population of wild
type plants growing near Saratov Russia root or Alice has become a mainstay of
today's vernacular taxonomy and then they say see this supplementary material
which I don't have for a discussion of these nomenclatural issues and an
elaboration of quote-unquote wild type nominalism which I think is kind of
interesting basically like I'm not you know it's kind of like is that really is
really even really a thing you know stop trying to make it a thing but maybe
maybe it is maybe it isn't I guess it indicates Tiv is in question and we call
it auto flower anyways right who says ruder yeah right the consumer is way
cuter way cuter the story as I remember it being told as far as the ditch weed
conversation goes with ruder Alice is that they tend to come from harsher
environments and from what I remember reading they come from areas with high
winds and propensity for plants that are growing upright to end up being
blown over which is why they're short and stout so growing in some sort of a
lowland where the wind blows right over the top of them a ditch would actually
allow the plant to stand in a more upright fashion so it's not necessarily
a derogatory term it's more of a descriptor of where that plant was found
and I think it goes back to Babel of Matthew was just reading I think Babel
of is one of the ones that was describing where the plant was found in
that it was found in these like hollows where the winds that blow over those
regions weren't necessarily as severe and it allowed that plant to maintain a
small population in that sort of hollowed out space apparently this is in
1922 for Babel off for anyone who is or or no jet or Janet Chesky with 1924 so
like in the 1920s this was this conversation was happening and I guess
yeah that's all I'll say about that I don't want to muddle it even further
actually fun fact you know there's a lot of you know I was speaking on that point
you know cannabis a lot of cannabis populations are of course associated
with like the the Middle East area but also Eastern Asia right in the Eurasian
sort of the Middle Eurasian steps and that kind of a thing we're super
important and and I feel like it would be I mean who am I to say this it would
be kind of nice if I think if people of certain cultures who are in fact
incredibly instrumental for sort of the you know domestication of this plant in
various places you know I think it'd be really cool if if those groups were able
to access it if they want to I think in some of those places it's a very much
possible or at least there's a there's extreme selection pressure against it
let's put it that way which I think is sort of unfortunate hopefully that
changes in the future well this has been awesome guys just kind of want to give
give everybody you know one one last chance you know please if you have more
to add to this don't let me stay in your way but I'd also like you know to
get the East Coasters over over to bed and I'm sure you got a big day tomorrow
as well so I do appreciate your time but one more time you know please go ahead
and add anything else you like but let's let everybody know where they can find
you again because I know all you guys got some great information and
specialties in your own right that we haven't even really touched here tonight
so somebody wants to get a hold of you let's go go around the horn here again
we'll go we'll go alphabetically just like the fire go alphabetically how
about you Cascadian girl yeah if I've said anything that anybody has a bone to
pick with tonight I'll make that nice and big in the corner for you there yeah
that's where you can come slide in my DMS and give me a piece of your mind
I'll definitely give you an answer but chat has been a pleasure I don't know
Peters lurking somewhere but I'm sure he'll see this at some point dude thanks
for having me on again it's always a pleasure and especially when we've got
such a controversial slash in-depth topic that can go 17,000 ways those it's
been a lot of fun it's really nice to have an organic conversation with you
guys not have a bulleted script you know so it's been a pleasure guys I
really enjoy talking with each and every one of you and it's been a great time if
you're looking for me Cascadian groans where you you'll find me but I do pop up
in other places so love me or hate me I'm still around that's awesome man and
next time maybe we'll get some chair throwing in involved we'll get some sort
of Jerry moment going for you we were all pretty nice to each other weren't we
huh I'd like to think so yeah how about you Spartan well I wasn't prepared I
thought we're doing alphabetically screwed me up well because I've been
going by Zenthanol on the flyer so please okay mute yourself got it all
right we're jumping to you Matthew Gates he this man insists on proper SOPs I
think that's valid so yeah I really enjoyed this conversation I thought that
you know I thought the paper that we discussed in the beginning being a great
jumping-off point to talk about everything from you know philosophy of
the mind to cultivation perspectives and organics and I think that's pretty cool
so if you're interested in my perspective about IPM and plant health
you can find me in three main locations one my Instagram which is at sink angel
you can also find me on my youtube channel is ethanol or my website is
ethanol calm I also have a patreon that you can support if you want access in my
discord where me and many other people discuss IPM related topics you can also
find me finally on oh I guess also on Twitter for that matter which is also at
sink angel for those who use that place I genuinely use it for following a bunch
of scientists so I recommend other people use it for good and not for
staying up at 2 a.m. looking at dank memes you know as you doom scroll through
your life I definitely have no experience of that but yeah so I really
appreciate it and I'll toss it over to Spartan grown oh thank you very much

that's cool one of these days I'll fill it out pretty soon pretty soon I promise
stay busy yeah stay busy with this channel this is a lot of time coming in
to it and to kind of on that tip house clean tomorrow morning future cannabis
project 10 a.m. on the west coast we got Brian and Layton living soil
conversations that's something that a lot of us love to tune into going into
the evening back here on FCPO2 we got Hota Herb grow and tell at 6 p.m. I'm not
quite sure what the topic is this week but he's covered some really cool stuff
he's gone into you know he touched cow mag but carbon silica different things
for the grow and Friday night we're gonna get even more geeky on the
genomics tip I'm excited for this I've got Trevor sun-grown mids coming to talk
great resource and I said hey man can you can you help break this down and you
know simplify it as much as possible the topic of genomics but yeah he's
putting together kind of a cool little presentation and that's gonna be a fun
conversation because it's gonna affect all of our futures when it comes to
genetics so we need to know about that and then last but not least I'm excited
for this this is this is my Halloween plans Spartan groans wearing their t-shirt
but Halloween day we're having a special album release party for
