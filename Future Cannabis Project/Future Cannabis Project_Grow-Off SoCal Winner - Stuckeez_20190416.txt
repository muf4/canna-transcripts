[00:00.000 --> 00:10.600]  We were with Wonderland Nursery on this and Kevin Jogary, he is somebody who has made this competition happen in Northern California and Southern California for the better part of the year.
[00:10.600 --> 00:16.840]  And he said he had something special and what he said is that there wasn't a lot of fuel on the market.
[00:16.840 --> 00:25.080]  Something that was real gassy, something that could dump in a commercial setting, something that you guys could all put your hats on.
[00:25.680 --> 00:32.160]  I talked to a few people, they were like, yeah, it didn't really stretch. This could work well in a home-grown environment. This could do well anywhere.
[00:33.480 --> 00:39.000]  I know that some of you know this already, but it was Dog Walker OG.
[00:41.640 --> 00:47.120]  This is one of the premier Finos at Dog Walker. I don't think that you can do anything better out there.
[00:47.240 --> 00:51.280]  Turf Masters, these are the people that could coax some flavor.
[00:51.280 --> 00:59.520]  And honestly, we did about half of the teams, which is what a county called the gassiest of the stream.
[00:59.520 --> 01:02.400]  But we really needed to smell that left.
[01:02.400 --> 01:05.040]  Keith Jordan and Scott, these are the number one!
[01:08.640 --> 01:12.840]  If we're growing for carts, if we're growing for hash, that's what matters.
[01:12.880 --> 01:18.040]  When you grow strong plants, they tend to be very turpy, very potent.
[01:18.040 --> 01:24.920]  This is the first time that we have ever had somebody squeak both potency and terpenes.
[01:24.920 --> 01:27.120]  But we did the damn thing.
[01:29.680 --> 01:33.240]  Please give it up for Keith Jordan, everybody.
[01:37.440 --> 01:41.040]  This is the first overall championship belt we've ever given.
[01:42.840 --> 01:44.840]  Dog Walker OG
[01:50.440 --> 01:55.840]  This contest meant more to me than the commercial or medicinal facilities,
[01:55.840 --> 01:58.840]  because it all comes down to the homegrower.
[01:58.840 --> 02:02.720]  They're able to produce medicine for themselves.
[02:02.720 --> 02:05.840]  And always having that peace of mind.
[02:05.840 --> 02:10.520]  Quality is different once you have it at the source, in a sense.
[02:10.520 --> 02:13.520]  He's the source. He's creating medicine for himself.
[02:13.520 --> 02:17.920]  And to be able to have that peace of mind and know everything that goes into it,
[02:17.920 --> 02:22.320]  it's a whole different experience that people don't know that go to the dispensaries.
[02:22.320 --> 02:25.520]  Even the people that are getting medicinal quality products,
[02:25.520 --> 02:30.520]  it's sent for testing, it goes through a packaging process, it's handled multiple times.
[02:30.520 --> 02:34.920]  You don't have that same, that visual luster.
[02:34.920 --> 02:36.920]  I don't know if you'd agree with me with that.
[02:36.920 --> 02:37.920]  Definitely.
[02:38.920 --> 02:45.920]  It's just something about it being straight, one set of hands, and that's it.
[02:45.920 --> 02:49.920]  How many people show you their jar of weed and it's better than what you have?
[02:49.920 --> 02:55.920]  You have something that's never been crushed in a bag, never been mishandled.
[02:55.920 --> 02:57.920]  It's different.
[02:57.920 --> 03:02.920]  I love it and I hate it because now I look at so much weed and I'm such a critic.
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.920]  It's like, this is why I grow though.
[03:06.920 --> 03:10.920]  I have to be what I want to see.
[03:10.920 --> 03:13.920]  You'd be a millionaire if you could just tell somebody how to grow their weed
[03:13.920 --> 03:15.920]  because you're like, this is just not up to par.
[03:15.920 --> 03:19.920]  I think it's just a lot of love that goes into it. It's different.
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.920]  It's not my job. It's just a thing I love to do.
[03:23.920 --> 03:25.920]  That's what brought me to it.
[03:25.920 --> 03:27.920]  Have you ever grown commercially?
[03:27.920 --> 03:29.920]  No, I started growing less than two years ago.
[03:30.920 --> 03:37.920]  I got a couple of lights and I actually bought some cuts from the store while I popped seeds.
[03:37.920 --> 03:39.920]  My first cut run...
[03:39.920 --> 03:41.920]  Allegedly.
[03:41.920 --> 03:43.920]  Yeah, allegedly.
[03:43.920 --> 03:45.920]  It's all hypothetical.
[03:48.920 --> 03:50.920]  I'm 25 years in.
[03:50.920 --> 03:54.920]  Yeah, no, I'm less than two years in.
[03:54.920 --> 03:56.920]  It's just been a home grow.
[03:56.920 --> 03:58.920]  I understand commercial in my head.
[03:58.920 --> 04:00.920]  You're from Florida, right?
[04:00.920 --> 04:01.920]  Yeah, I'm from Florida.
[04:01.920 --> 04:03.920]  So how long ago did you come out here?
[04:03.920 --> 04:05.920]  California, by the way.
[04:05.920 --> 04:09.920]  420, it'll be about two years.
[04:09.920 --> 04:13.920]  We had to smoke all my weed that I had left for 420.
[04:13.920 --> 04:17.920]  And then we packed our shit in a car and we left.
[04:17.920 --> 04:20.920]  And that was it. I just committed.
[04:20.920 --> 04:21.920]  And that's the only way.
[04:21.920 --> 04:25.920]  I quit my day job and I was just committed.
[04:25.920 --> 04:27.920]  That's so rad.
[04:27.920 --> 04:29.920]  That's paying off.
[04:29.920 --> 04:33.920]  But I do a lot of research and I do a lot of thinking on top of that research.
[04:33.920 --> 04:35.920]  Because you can just read all you want.
[04:35.920 --> 04:36.920]  You can be told all you want.
[04:36.920 --> 04:38.920]  But what actually makes sense in your head?
[04:38.920 --> 04:41.920]  What makes sense for your conditions?
[04:41.920 --> 04:44.920]  I think that's what everybody gets wrong, in my opinion.
[04:44.920 --> 04:47.920]  They try to copy somebody else's stuff.
[04:47.920 --> 04:49.920]  You gotta do you.
[04:49.920 --> 04:51.920]  I was talking about this with families.
[04:51.920 --> 04:53.920]  It's the age of technology.
[04:53.920 --> 04:55.920]  It's not having things at your grasp.
[04:55.920 --> 04:57.920]  It didn't exist in a Webster's Dictionary to me.
[04:57.920 --> 04:59.920]  I had to use my imagination.
[04:59.920 --> 05:02.920]  And the thing is, you run out of creativity.
[05:02.920 --> 05:08.920]  But at the same time, it's always good to learn by changing what you're doing.
[05:08.920 --> 05:10.920]  To experience new things.
[05:10.920 --> 05:13.920]  Meaning you may perfect something you thought you had perfected.
[05:13.920 --> 05:19.920]  I've already learned quickly that I'm always going to keep learning.
[05:19.920 --> 05:21.920]  This is a changing thing.
[05:21.920 --> 05:25.920]  It's not even something you can get perfected, in my opinion.
[05:25.920 --> 05:28.920]  Because of all the new technology, all the new sciences coming out.
[05:28.920 --> 05:30.920]  Everything we're learning.
[05:30.920 --> 05:33.920]  For me, I've always been a rockwell grower.
[05:33.920 --> 05:38.920]  As far as your grow methods, and the mediums, and the type of lighting you're using.
[05:38.920 --> 05:39.920]  Even the nutrients.
[05:39.920 --> 05:45.920]  What goes into the thinking of picking out each one of those individual items?
[05:45.920 --> 05:50.920]  Because that's really one of the things that growers use as their advantage.
[05:50.920 --> 05:52.920]  It's just like a chef.
[05:52.920 --> 05:57.920]  You can get any brand of pepper, any brand of pan, any brand of olive oil.
[05:57.920 --> 05:59.920]  It doesn't matter what it is.
[05:59.920 --> 06:04.920]  What went into you choosing the different types of media, different things that you used this time?
[06:04.920 --> 06:06.920]  That's a good question.
[06:06.920 --> 06:10.920]  Because it wasn't just, what is everybody else running?
[06:10.920 --> 06:14.920]  I watched quite a few people grow.
[06:14.920 --> 06:16.920]  A lot of my friends grow some really good weed.
[06:16.920 --> 06:20.920]  So I had, luckily, a lot of things to take from theirs.
[06:20.920 --> 06:23.920]  And some things not to take from theirs.
[06:23.920 --> 06:27.920]  But a lot of people were killing it with the mills.
[06:27.920 --> 06:29.920]  So I decided that I was going to run that.
[06:29.920 --> 06:34.920]  And organics, it's intimidating, I'm not going to lie.
[06:34.920 --> 06:37.920]  They do a lot of work with live soil.
[06:37.920 --> 06:39.920]  And keeping things just beautiful.
[06:39.920 --> 06:44.920]  And I didn't go that route for preference of with cocoa.
[06:44.920 --> 06:47.920]  It's easier.
[06:47.920 --> 06:50.920]  And it helps with...
[06:50.920 --> 06:53.920]  I call it a hydroponics on training wheels.
[06:53.920 --> 06:54.920]  Exactly.
[06:54.920 --> 06:56.920]  You know?
[06:56.920 --> 06:58.920]  Realistically, because you have...
[06:58.920 --> 07:00.920]  It's hard to overfeed, it's hard to overwater.
[07:00.920 --> 07:02.920]  The water retentions are very similar.
[07:02.920 --> 07:03.920]  I use fabric pots.
[07:03.920 --> 07:05.920]  But you just don't have the nutrients.
[07:05.920 --> 07:08.920]  So you have full control of whatever you're putting into there.
[07:08.920 --> 07:10.920]  That's the training wheels.
[07:10.920 --> 07:12.920]  No, and that's true.
[07:12.920 --> 07:13.920]  It works really well.
[07:13.920 --> 07:18.920]  So it's like, well, if it's working, you know?
[07:18.920 --> 07:19.920]  Why not perfect that?
[07:19.920 --> 07:20.920]  It's a lot more work.
[07:20.920 --> 07:22.920]  You got to huck those bags of soil.
[07:22.920 --> 07:25.920]  You know, for a lot of home growers,
[07:25.920 --> 07:29.920]  they're putting them in black contractor bags and hefty bags.
[07:29.920 --> 07:31.920]  Trying to smuggle them into their apartment or house.
[07:31.920 --> 07:33.920]  Whatever it is.
[07:33.920 --> 07:35.920]  Oh, I remember those days.
[07:35.920 --> 07:37.920]  I had a golf bag.
[07:37.920 --> 07:41.920]  I had a golf bag and a camping tent bag.
[07:41.920 --> 07:44.920]  That I could put two bottles of 20-pound tanks of CO2
[07:44.920 --> 07:46.920]  and just bring them in there.
[07:46.920 --> 07:49.920]  I was golfing and I had a bag with whatever in it.
[07:51.920 --> 07:53.920]  I can't tell you.
[07:53.920 --> 07:55.920]  I'm not going to tell you.
[07:55.920 --> 07:58.920]  No, everything's allegedly.
[07:58.920 --> 08:01.920]  This is all for entertainment use only.
[08:01.920 --> 08:09.920]  It's really cool just the fact of I was able to get cuts from a store.
[08:09.920 --> 08:11.920]  Neighborhood Nursery gave me the cuts.
[08:11.920 --> 08:13.920]  They worked out really well.
[08:13.920 --> 08:16.920]  It was some mango train wreck.
[08:16.920 --> 08:18.920]  All my buddies were giving me shit for it.
[08:18.920 --> 08:20.920]  They're like, oh, you're going to grow some train wreck, huh?
[08:20.920 --> 08:22.920]  I'm like, yeah, I'm going to grow some train wreck.
[08:22.920 --> 08:23.920]  You know, that's what I got.
[08:23.920 --> 08:24.920]  I'm going to crush it.
[08:24.920 --> 08:26.920]  You said something to me earlier about Miami mango.
[08:26.920 --> 08:28.920]  There's a strain.
[08:28.920 --> 08:32.920]  Somebody's like, oh, if you're from back in Florida, there's this strain.
[08:32.920 --> 08:33.920]  What was that strain?
[08:33.920 --> 08:36.920]  It was a mango that we used to have.
[08:37.920 --> 08:40.920]  There used to be so much of it that everyone would hit you up and be like,
[08:40.920 --> 08:41.920]  hey, do you have weed?
[08:41.920 --> 08:43.920]  No, I got some mango.
[08:43.920 --> 08:45.920]  I'll call you back.
[08:45.920 --> 08:48.920]  I'm the one that's sitting there like, all right, I'll take all the mango.
[08:48.920 --> 08:50.920]  It was the terpiest weed I've ever seen.
[08:50.920 --> 08:52.920]  It was just incredible.
[08:52.920 --> 08:54.920]  Now I can't get that mango cut.
[08:54.920 --> 08:56.920]  Miami mango.
[08:56.920 --> 08:57.920]  Let me get that cut, man.
[08:57.920 --> 08:58.920]  Give him the cut.
[08:58.920 --> 08:59.920]  Give him the cut.
[08:59.920 --> 09:04.920]  I mean, one thing that comes to mind with Florida is OG Kush.
[09:04.920 --> 09:06.920]  I think it's Josh D's story.
[09:06.920 --> 09:09.920]  That originated in Florida.
[09:09.920 --> 09:12.920]  What is your experience with OG Kush?
[09:12.920 --> 09:14.920]  I mean, we had OG Kush Fino tonight.
[09:14.920 --> 09:16.920]  We had a lot of it.
[09:16.920 --> 09:19.920]  Everyone hates my palate, I'll tell you that.
[09:19.920 --> 09:23.920]  Nobody's – I mean, not everybody, but the majority of people are like –
[09:23.920 --> 09:25.920]  I hand them a jar.
[09:25.920 --> 09:27.920]  I'm like, this is my favorite weed ever.
[09:27.920 --> 09:29.920]  And they're like, this is – what?
[09:29.920 --> 09:31.920]  Like, this is your favorite weed ever?
[09:31.920 --> 09:32.920]  Where's the gas?
[09:32.920 --> 09:33.920]  And I'm like, no, it's straight lemon.
[09:33.920 --> 09:36.920]  It's like when you tell somebody you like Blue Dream, they're just like, what?
[09:36.920 --> 09:37.920]  You know?
[09:37.920 --> 09:40.920]  Like, hypothetically, Blue Dream might not be that bad.
[09:40.920 --> 09:42.920]  If you grow it right, I'm all about taste.
[09:42.920 --> 09:43.920]  I always joke.
[09:43.920 --> 09:45.920]  I'm like, I'm going to smoke enough to get high.
[09:45.920 --> 09:49.920]  OGs are nice, and they get me, you know, dumb high.
[09:49.920 --> 09:54.920]  But it's the flavor I smoke for because I'm going to get high regardless off of everything.
[09:54.920 --> 09:59.920]  And, you know, I just – I really love sativas, but not the full on –
[09:59.920 --> 10:01.920]  Did you treat this plant differently this time?
[10:01.920 --> 10:04.920]  I didn't treat it differently at all except for a veg.
[10:04.920 --> 10:11.920]  I was actually redoing my room, and I got kind of lazy with it, kind of put the time off.
[10:11.920 --> 10:20.920]  And then we just came down to it like, all right, this has to go into flower to get 60 days and some dry time and some cure time.
[10:20.920 --> 10:21.920]  And it has to go in today.
[10:21.920 --> 10:22.920]  So it went in –
[10:22.920 --> 10:23.920]  60 days?
[10:23.920 --> 10:24.920]  You ran it?
[10:24.920 --> 10:26.920]  I actually pulled it 57.
[10:27.920 --> 10:32.920]  Yeah, I started to – for whatever reason, I started to see it pull a couple little nanners out.
[10:32.920 --> 10:34.920]  And I was like, I could pluck them.
[10:34.920 --> 10:37.920]  I could see what they do, but I'm not even going to risk it, you know.
[10:37.920 --> 10:41.920]  So I pulled it and it worked out.
[10:41.920 --> 10:46.920]  So that's what had me sketching the whole time is, you know, did I pull too early?
[10:46.920 --> 10:50.920]  Because everyone else is like, oh, we're taking this really far.
[10:50.920 --> 10:53.920]  And I'm like, I don't have time for that, you know.
[10:53.920 --> 10:56.920]  People talk about looking at the trichromes with a microscope and stuff.
[10:56.920 --> 11:00.920]  And for me on a commercial level, we don't really do that.
[11:00.920 --> 11:05.920]  We look at a monthly calendar, and if it's a day we need to pull, we pull.
[11:05.920 --> 11:06.920]  Yeah.
[11:06.920 --> 11:13.920]  I also look at people like Moxie who make a lot of concentrates, and, you know, they get bashed for pulling early.
[11:13.920 --> 11:16.920]  But we pull early, and it's always –
[11:16.920 --> 11:17.920]  For concentrates, it's different though.
[11:17.920 --> 11:20.920]  Well, I like concentrates, so that's, you know, where most of mine goes.
[11:21.920 --> 11:25.920]  So, you know, that's what I prefer to smoke.
[11:25.920 --> 11:27.920]  What kind of lighting do you use?
[11:27.920 --> 11:30.920]  I use Phantom DE's HPS.
[11:30.920 --> 11:33.920]  That grow-off plant was grown under 500 watts.
[11:33.920 --> 11:34.920]  Yeah.
[11:34.920 --> 11:36.920]  Took up the whole 4x4 space.
[11:36.920 --> 11:43.920]  It was, you know, because of the issue in the beginning, they gave everybody a little bit more time, so I use that for veg.
[11:43.920 --> 11:45.920]  What did you get for yield?
[11:45.920 --> 11:47.920]  About a pound and a half.
[11:47.920 --> 11:48.920]  For a 4x4?
[11:48.920 --> 11:50.920]  For a 4x4, under 500 watts.
[11:50.920 --> 11:52.920]  What kind of pot did you use?
[11:52.920 --> 11:54.920]  10-gallon Smart Pot.
[11:54.920 --> 11:55.920]  Nice.
[11:55.920 --> 11:56.920]  With canna coco.
[11:56.920 --> 12:03.920]  And as far as the feeding, as far as the amount of water saturation per day, liters, gallons, how much did you feed the plant per day?
[12:03.920 --> 12:10.920]  So I always just, you know, feed for about 30 seconds and then let it sit, go to another plant, come back.
[12:10.920 --> 12:11.920]  Is this drip irrigation or hand feed?
[12:11.920 --> 12:12.920]  No, this is hand feed.
[12:12.920 --> 12:14.920]  Yeah, I'm on a wand.
[12:15.920 --> 12:18.920]  For me back in the day, I would be like, everyone's second counts different.
[12:18.920 --> 12:21.920]  I'd be like, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 1,000.
[12:21.920 --> 12:26.920]  I feel like mine starts slow and starts, you know, getting faster towards the end.
[12:26.920 --> 12:28.920]  Did you ever sit there with a pitcher and measure the millage?
[12:28.920 --> 12:29.920]  No.
[12:29.920 --> 12:36.920]  You know, I tried, but I've got ADD, so like even if I'm counting there, I'm just going to be like, okay, well, what is this thinking about?
[12:36.920 --> 12:38.920]  For me, when I'm hand feeding, I would always jiggle the pot.
[12:38.920 --> 12:42.920]  You jiggle it with one hand, you know, the retention level, you're just like, oh, this needs 8 seconds.
[12:43.920 --> 12:48.920]  So I'll hit it for like 30 seconds and move on to another pot, and I usually do like two rounds.
[12:48.920 --> 12:58.920]  And the next time I give it water until I start to see just a drop, start dripping out for runoff and let whatever runs off of there.
[12:58.920 --> 13:00.920]  One feeding per day, though?
[13:00.920 --> 13:04.920]  Yeah, one feeding per – it starts out usually every two, three days.
[13:04.920 --> 13:05.920]  Spot feeding.
[13:05.920 --> 13:10.920]  Yeah, towards the end, it's, you know, I'm hitting it every day, every day.
[13:10.920 --> 13:12.920]  Do you flush once a week?
[13:12.920 --> 13:20.920]  Yeah, I flush – well, I do, you know, two feed days, and then the third time is just water and cow mag.
[13:20.920 --> 13:26.920]  And when you're spot feeding, so it would be like a Monday feed, Wednesday feed, maybe like a Friday flush.
[13:26.920 --> 13:31.920]  And then so every – so I just take care of my flushes that way.
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.920]  I never have like a set, you know, flush every two weeks or whatever, but I will hit it a little harder if I'm –
[13:36.920 --> 13:38.920]  Do you have any secrets on your flush?
[13:38.920 --> 13:39.920]  What?
[13:39.920 --> 13:40.920]  What do you flush with?
[13:40.920 --> 13:41.920]  Nothing.
[13:41.920 --> 13:42.920]  These are secrets.
[13:42.920 --> 13:43.920]  Just water.
[13:43.920 --> 13:44.920]  Just water.
[13:44.920 --> 13:45.920]  Yeah.
[13:45.920 --> 13:46.920]  All right.
[13:46.920 --> 13:47.920]  So I'm just, you know, I'm just –
[13:47.920 --> 13:50.920]  What do you think of people using flushing agents and different things?
[13:50.920 --> 13:55.920]  I've, you know, I've heard different things, and I've tried, you know, something that one person said was good,
[13:55.920 --> 13:58.920]  and then the other person says, well, that's how you, you know, kill your plant.
[13:58.920 --> 14:05.920]  And I'm like, well, you know, kind of is the goal here, but not really, but, you know, it's –
[14:05.920 --> 14:11.920]  When you look at the amount of runoff, you're like this in your head looking – for me it's about reading plants.
[14:11.920 --> 14:13.920]  And if you're hand-feeding, sometimes for me –
[14:13.920 --> 14:17.920]  If they start telling me they're, you know, getting too much water, I start backing off, you know,
[14:17.920 --> 14:21.920]  won't run them until runoff, and then I'll switch up my flush schedule.
[14:21.920 --> 14:29.920]  But for the most part, I notice that most plants will stay on the same regimen if you have a good regimen, you know.
[14:29.920 --> 14:34.920]  Like it's – some plants are finicky, but I also stay away from those plants.
[14:34.920 --> 14:40.920]  I like heaters that are easier to grow and, you know, like to work with you a little bit better.
[14:40.920 --> 14:41.920]  So –
[14:41.920 --> 14:47.920]  So when you fed it this time, how many different varieties of plants were you sharing the same reservoir feed with?
[14:47.920 --> 14:49.920]  Three different.
[14:49.920 --> 14:52.920]  Okay. Are they all Indica, hybrid, sativa?
[14:52.920 --> 15:01.920]  One of them is a sativa-leaning, the other one's a jet fuel cross with Fabuloso, and the other one was the grow-off, so –
[15:01.920 --> 15:10.920]  You know, with the grow-off being an OG, for me, I've always laughed at the OG strain because I feel like so many people put names on it.
[15:10.920 --> 15:18.920]  And it doesn't matter. It could be my better-than-your-OG, this one, dog walker OG, whatever it may be, it's an OG.
[15:18.920 --> 15:24.920]  But in our minds, we look for a gassy, diesely, kind of piney strain when it comes to an OG.
[15:24.920 --> 15:26.920]  I mean, have you grown OGs before?
[15:26.920 --> 15:28.920]  I tend to stay away from them.
[15:28.920 --> 15:36.920]  To be honest, everyone gives me shit for growing the more fruity flavors, the more sativa flavors, but, you know, that's what I like.
[15:36.920 --> 15:40.920]  I'm not going to grow because of what you like. I'm smoking this stuff.
[15:40.920 --> 15:44.920]  So if you want to smoke my bag, then you're going to smoke what I grew.
[15:44.920 --> 15:52.920]  And that's – what's nice is that, you know, I became friends with a seed bank who loves edibles.
[15:52.920 --> 15:54.920]  Which seed bank?
[15:54.920 --> 15:58.920]  Oregon Elite. Great guy. Great company.
[15:58.920 --> 16:02.920]  And he's made it very easy for me to get my hands on seeds.
[16:02.920 --> 16:06.920]  And I just haven't stopped popping them.
[16:06.920 --> 16:10.920]  You know, there's people who give me shit for it. Other people are like, you know, pop my seeds for me.
[16:10.920 --> 16:20.920]  It's hard because out of 10, 12, whatever many seeds you have, you have to track the data for each one of those seeds and see how each phenotype –
[16:20.920 --> 16:24.920]  I always tell people it's like, you know, seeds are like parents.
[16:24.920 --> 16:30.920]  You may have the same mom, the same father, and I've always referred to it as the Michael Phelps theory in my head.
[16:30.920 --> 16:35.920]  Michael Phelps is shit, you know. He smoked weed, won the most gold medals, you know.
[16:35.920 --> 16:43.920]  So when I look at plants, whether it's taking the most amount of clones for a strain or even popping seeds, who's our Michael Phelps of the family?
[16:43.920 --> 16:49.920]  And the thing is, is so many different attributes go into finding the different phenos of a strain.
[16:49.920 --> 16:55.920]  And, you know, picking those out really comes down to not personal opinion at a commercial level.
[16:55.920 --> 16:59.920]  It's public opinion. So you're looking what the market wants.
[16:59.920 --> 17:05.920]  And, you know, when it comes down to whether it's selecting different phenos or clones, what's your process?
[17:05.920 --> 17:16.920]  Like for me, you know, if I had to plant 10 plants, I was taking 50 cuts and I was throwing away quite a bit of cuts just to find the ones that were accelerating the most at the beginning, especially.
[17:17.920 --> 17:25.920]  I mean, if I can, I do that. But, you know, sometimes space is limited on moms and, you know, it's just you take the cuts, you can run.
[17:25.920 --> 17:32.920]  And as long as you, you know, give them the right love, most of them, you know, turn out well.
[17:32.920 --> 17:37.920]  But I don't go for what the market wants. Everybody, you know, picks out what the next best thing is.
[17:37.920 --> 17:41.920]  And sometimes what I like is the next best thing. But that's pure.
[17:42.920 --> 17:46.920]  You don't have the millions of dollars in marketing. I feel like some shit gets so hyped up.
[17:46.920 --> 17:54.920]  I don't know about you, but I feel like it really gets hyped up and you actually see and you're like, dude, I can show you 10 other streams that look way better.
[17:54.920 --> 18:01.920]  It doesn't matter. You know, like I can hype up something all day. You know, I've always been a salesman, but it's like it doesn't matter.
[18:01.920 --> 18:05.920]  As long as it's fired, the market's going to like it anyway. So grow what you like.
[18:05.920 --> 18:10.920]  And there are going to be people that, you know, grow or that like what you grow.
[18:11.920 --> 18:18.920]  I don't go after the Gorilla Glue craze, the wedding cake craze. It's not like my mint lemonade is.
[18:18.920 --> 18:24.920]  What's your ultimate dream in this? Do you want to grow for a living? Do you want to own your own type of facility to grow?
[18:24.920 --> 18:27.920]  See, for me, it's always been a dream to me to do what you love.
[18:27.920 --> 18:39.920]  And, you know, I see all in the reason I bring up marketing is, is there's so many strains are so hyped up that I feel like people don't get a true sense of what is actually good.
[18:39.920 --> 18:44.920]  Cannabis. And the thing is, is if we don't have the type of money, we don't have the type of followers.
[18:44.920 --> 18:51.920]  It's not put out there and people get hyped up. And I think we all get caught up sometimes, no matter what it is in life.
[18:51.920 --> 18:54.920]  And what do you think some of the hyped up strains are?
[18:54.920 --> 18:56.920]  Purple Punch.
[18:56.920 --> 19:01.920]  Oh, dude, you know, Purple Punch. It has a visual and smell appeal. That's amazing.
[19:01.920 --> 19:03.920]  So I think it's almost like the blue.
[19:03.920 --> 19:10.920]  I can't say Gorilla Gloom is hype. I mean, that will knock me on my ass. Purple Punch. Not so much for me.
[19:10.920 --> 19:16.920]  You know, maybe it's and I always say maybe I haven't had the right one.
[19:16.920 --> 19:21.920]  You know, it's crazy. You know, it's actually Indica Dominant. It's Grand Andy Purple and Larry OG.
[19:21.920 --> 19:25.920]  So you think if you cross those two, you know, it actually have a punch. It doesn't.
[19:25.920 --> 19:30.920]  You know, it's crazy, too. But you'll find the people that do love it.
[19:30.920 --> 19:33.920]  And that's what, you know, the market is. The market is the market.
[19:33.920 --> 19:36.920]  And as long as you grow it well, somebody is going to like it.
[19:36.920 --> 19:42.920]  And, you know, people say Blue Dream is a hype strain and they don't want it or whatever.
[19:42.920 --> 19:46.920]  If I grow some Blue Dream, you're going to want it. You know, like there's it's going to turn out good.
[19:46.920 --> 19:49.920]  It's going to be amazing. It's like very white.
[19:49.920 --> 19:54.920]  And if I don't tell you it's Blue Dream, you're not even going to you know, some people might.
[19:54.920 --> 19:56.920]  But all the people that, oh, I don't like Blue Dream.
[19:56.920 --> 20:00.920]  Half the people you put Blue Dream in their face are going to be like, oh, what is this?
[20:00.920 --> 20:03.920]  Exactly. It has a bag appeal and it has a smell.
[20:03.920 --> 20:06.920]  And I think that's what sells a lot of times.
[20:06.920 --> 20:12.920]  And really, at the end of the day, everybody has a different body and everybody's going to accept things differently.
[20:12.920 --> 20:15.920]  It's just like alcohol or anything else you put in your body.
[20:15.920 --> 20:18.920]  You're going to react differently. Some people can have spicy food.
[20:18.920 --> 20:23.920]  Some people can. Some people, you know, have alcohol and they act, you know, normal.
[20:24.920 --> 20:29.920]  And some people fall asleep. Some people act like an asshole and they act violent and crazy and they black out.
[20:29.920 --> 20:33.920]  So the thing is, is finding out what works for you.
[20:33.920 --> 20:41.920]  And, you know, I think that so many people discount different strains because something's hyped up to where they need to open their mind.
[20:41.920 --> 20:45.920]  It's like really it's all about full spectrum. Full spectrum is everything.
[20:46.920 --> 20:51.920]  I it's just I don't go for what people hype up.
[20:51.920 --> 20:53.920]  And I think a lot of people hate me for that or not.
[20:53.920 --> 20:55.920]  What's your favorite strain?
[20:55.920 --> 20:59.920]  My mint lemonade, Lemon G and Cinnamon cookies by Sin City.
[20:59.920 --> 21:04.920]  And that's basically what I'm referring to when people tell me it's booze.
[21:04.920 --> 21:06.920]  What is it like? Tell us.
[21:06.920 --> 21:13.920]  Oh, man, it it's nothing but that old school lemon, just strong lemon punch in the mouth.
[21:13.920 --> 21:15.920]  Trainwreck kind of.
[21:15.920 --> 21:17.920]  When you say lemon, I think trainwreck. I don't know.
[21:17.920 --> 21:22.920]  I think Lemon G, you know, like that's what I'm comparing it to is the Lemon G.
[21:22.920 --> 21:26.920]  We had a lot of Lemon G in Florida as concentrates when concentrates at the market.
[21:26.920 --> 21:32.920]  Somebody flooded down there with Lemon G, Terpy batter is what I started on.
[21:32.920 --> 21:39.920]  And, you know, I found a shop that had a glass nail on a dry J hook and I went to town.
[21:39.920 --> 21:41.920]  Everyone's like, what are you smoking?
[21:41.920 --> 21:43.920]  You know, at these parties, I'm sitting there with a blowtorch.
[21:43.920 --> 21:50.920]  They're like, I think he's gone on, you know, but it was, you know, I love that Lemon G.
[21:50.920 --> 21:52.920]  And that's what really got me on it.
[21:52.920 --> 21:58.920]  And then when I went to Colorado, they had this, you know, 92 Lemon OG that I was like, I hit a dab of it.
[21:58.920 --> 22:00.920]  And I said, this is it.
[22:00.920 --> 22:02.920]  I like how they say 92. Yeah, whatever.
[22:02.920 --> 22:07.920]  To lineage, I don't think OG existed to most people by 92 by the story of it.
[22:07.920 --> 22:09.920]  So it's just funny to hear that.
[22:09.920 --> 22:13.920]  Very true. I just, you know, that's that's what I found.
[22:13.920 --> 22:19.920]  And I was like, holy crap, this is the, you know, smell again and the taste that I found.
[22:19.920 --> 22:24.920]  And so I just started popping lemon seeds and lemon tree, all these other ones.
[22:24.920 --> 22:28.920]  I didn't find what I was looking for.
[22:28.920 --> 22:33.920]  This cinnamon cookies and lemon G cross is the closest I've found.
[22:34.920 --> 22:40.920]  And I found it. I've actually for a while, I was the only one that I could find that had pop some.
[22:40.920 --> 22:48.920]  And then now I'm seeing a couple, you know, or grew it enough to post it or some of the OGs that just don't post, you know.
[22:48.920 --> 22:51.920]  Who knows? They could be crushing it in a closet somewhere.
[22:51.920 --> 22:57.920]  But that's nobody really agrees with me that mint lemonade is their favorite.
[22:57.920 --> 23:00.920]  You know, I got a few buddies that do, but most people call me crazy.
[23:00.920 --> 23:05.920]  And they're like, where's, you know, the triple X, OG, where's the fire OG?
[23:05.920 --> 23:08.920]  We want we want all those. And I'm like, it's not my style.
[23:08.920 --> 23:11.920]  They're the same friends. You could probably give them 10 different OGs.
[23:11.920 --> 23:13.920]  They couldn't name each one of them.
[23:13.920 --> 23:19.920]  Yeah. You know, I've got some I've got some OG connoisseurs that just don't like what I grow.
[23:19.920 --> 23:22.920]  And I respect it. It is what it is. I grow what I like.
[23:22.920 --> 23:27.920]  They grow what they like when we smoke. If if it's not what we want to smoke, we'll roll up our own.
[23:27.920 --> 23:33.920]  You know, who cares? I'm not I'm not in any competition with anybody.
[23:33.920 --> 23:39.920]  I just want to do what I love, like you said. And that's I quit my day job to come out here and, you know,
[23:39.920 --> 23:42.920]  chase my edible dream, chase my, you know, growing dream.
[23:42.920 --> 23:47.920]  And you're going to have to pick a dream and win an award for an edible.
[23:47.920 --> 23:50.920]  You know, so what's your focus in edibles?
[23:50.920 --> 23:54.920]  Like what kind of edibles and what's your vision for it?
[23:54.920 --> 24:03.920]  I have all sorts of ideas. You know, I'm always constantly trying to find something that's with the edibles.
[24:03.920 --> 24:09.920]  I do chase the market that that is something I don't want the cookies, the brownies, the gummy bears.
[24:09.920 --> 24:13.920]  I don't think the market does either, but they don't have much of a choice.
[24:13.920 --> 24:16.920]  You know, they want those, but they want something else.
[24:16.920 --> 24:21.920]  And the problem is with the baked goods is the shelf life.
[24:21.920 --> 24:33.920]  And so I've started making chewing gum that we're trying to get into the 10 milligram bracket of recreational because it will hit you better.
[24:33.920 --> 24:36.920]  You're absorbing it instead of digesting it.
[24:36.920 --> 24:42.920]  And so you're getting a little more bang for your buck on the 10 milligram limit that recreational sets.
[24:42.920 --> 24:46.920]  And I also have. How long do you have to chew gum to get the 10 milligrams?
[24:46.920 --> 24:50.920]  I'm curious. You know that I'm not sure.
[24:50.920 --> 24:55.920]  Do you have to swallow it? You know, do you get higher if you swallow it?
[24:55.920 --> 25:01.920]  That's a test we need to take. But I like it because it's it's easy to microdose.
[25:01.920 --> 25:05.920]  You know, chewing gum only last 10, 15 minutes tops.
[25:05.920 --> 25:08.920]  Most of the zebra. 30 seconds.
[25:08.920 --> 25:18.920]  Whatever it is. Yeah. But no, I I just I run chewing gum and I've got some other ideas for the rec market because of that 10 milligram limit.
[25:18.920 --> 25:23.920]  The ropes, my sweet and sour ropes, I just don't see being bite size.
[25:23.920 --> 25:29.920]  I have them bite size and we will go after the market with bite size.
[25:29.920 --> 25:33.920]  But you may have people like me think I'm saving calories of bite size.
[25:33.920 --> 25:40.920]  Very true. And you can't you know, I'm trying to get skinny, but I want to get too skinny because you can't trust the skinny candy, man.
[25:40.920 --> 25:44.920]  That's that's what I've always heard. Shout out Claude, the candy man.
[25:44.920 --> 25:49.920]  You know, it's just it is what it is with that market.
[25:49.920 --> 26:01.920]  I'm chasing what other people aren't tackling. And shelf life is what I'm going for as well, because people, you know, they have to refrigerate these cookies that still have this.
[26:01.920 --> 26:09.920]  It's not like you can make this stuff on demand. You know, the thing is, is if it was a perfect world, it'd be like a farmer's market to me.
[26:10.920 --> 26:16.920]  You know, especially for home growers like you did tonight. It's like, you know, there should be a home growers association.
[26:16.920 --> 26:33.920]  It's like people that are not gardening to a commercial level should be able to grow within their means or actual state legal means and be able to trade or barter or sell their goods within a community without having the same stipulations as a commercial cultivation.
[26:33.920 --> 26:41.920]  Because let's face it, it's not like you're doing it to survive. A lot of people that are doing things for cultivating at home is for themselves.
[26:41.920 --> 26:47.920]  I smoke a lot and I'm not trying to buy all the booze from the store. You know, that's that's the problem.
[26:47.920 --> 26:52.920]  I do still I I grow at home. I grow my own stuff and then I still want to smoke other people's stuff.
[26:52.920 --> 26:56.920]  I'm not you know, I'm not the best grower out there until the night. But.
[26:57.920 --> 27:04.920]  But let's just put it out there. I had a premonition that I was going to win when I did way before and I did.
[27:04.920 --> 27:08.920]  I told you tonight before you won. I think you're going to win. Did I not?
[27:08.920 --> 27:15.920]  I've been telling everybody that I was going to win from the start because you got to you know, it's all about mental.
[27:15.920 --> 27:22.920]  You know, for me, it's mental strength. You know, it's not being cocky. It's having confidence in yourself.
[27:23.920 --> 27:27.920]  Yeah. And if you don't have confidence in yourself, then what's the point?
[27:27.920 --> 27:32.920]  I chased the dream because I was confident, you know, and I I waited as well.
[27:32.920 --> 27:39.920]  I should have been out here years before I did. I waited because I was listening to other people tell me that it's not going to work.
[27:39.920 --> 27:45.920]  You know, it's too hard for you. Why? Like, why didn't I ask myself why before that?
[27:45.920 --> 27:51.920]  I was like, you know, you're probably right. Like kicking myself for that, you know, but.
[27:51.920 --> 27:56.920]  I finally had the self-confidence to come out here, do the damn thing.
[27:56.920 --> 28:01.920]  And how'd you hear about the girl? Miss Rad Reifer, a friend of mine.
[28:01.920 --> 28:06.920]  She she entered and I said, well, you know, I kind of want to enter, too.
[28:06.920 --> 28:12.920]  You know, and I saw the party last time. I was like, oh, even if I don't win, it'll be a cool time.
[28:12.920 --> 28:16.920]  You know, Blake is actually from my hometown.
[28:16.920 --> 28:23.920]  So it was cool to party with him as well across the whole country, you know, have him DJ for us and Maddy Ghost.
[28:23.920 --> 28:31.920]  And it was just a cool event to come to with my friends over here because, you know, I only have a select few of them.
[28:31.920 --> 28:36.920]  And do they help you in the garden? No. You know, I do everything myself.
[28:36.920 --> 28:42.920]  I do have, you know, my buddy who comes over and helps me tremendously.
[28:43.920 --> 28:48.920]  But, you know, it's it's for the most part hands on.
[28:48.920 --> 28:52.920]  That's all me. And I'm in there all the time. Music, no music, music.
[28:52.920 --> 28:58.920]  Oh, yeah. Oh, all over the board, too. I mean, you can't let them get too too bored.
[28:58.920 --> 29:02.920]  I always play music when I'm not in there. Yeah, no, I do, too.
[29:02.920 --> 29:06.920]  I've got a speaker in there and they why wouldn't they love it? I love music.
[29:06.920 --> 29:12.920]  Did the winner get music? I actually put the speaker in the tray with the grow off plant.
[29:12.920 --> 29:18.920]  If that says anything. So for the first two weeks, I left it on Michael Jackson, Pandora.
[29:18.920 --> 29:21.920]  Oh, it was pissing. That was simulated a star response.
[29:21.920 --> 29:26.920]  You know, you know how to get a man up and then I threw it all over the place.
[29:26.920 --> 29:31.920]  You know, I had some reggae in there, some rap, some, you know, rock.
[29:31.920 --> 29:35.920]  It's just whatever I felt like listening to. They were going to listen to.
[29:35.920 --> 29:39.920]  And I'd walk out of the room and leave playing. And, you know, that was it.
[29:39.920 --> 29:47.920]  But I have you don't hand me the aux cord because you're probably just not going to be stoked.
[29:47.920 --> 29:53.920]  I will hit every genre that you didn't even know was possible.
[29:53.920 --> 29:58.920]  So keeps life interesting. And I truly believe that the plants like it.
[29:58.920 --> 30:09.920]  Oh, did you got to look at vibrational patterns and tectonic plates and frequency and what it does to sand alone when they play it at high volumes?
[30:09.920 --> 30:13.920]  It's it's it's really interesting. I've never even heard of that.
[30:13.920 --> 30:20.920]  So look it up. It'll get real high or medicated and working on it.
[30:20.920 --> 30:24.920]  That blunt you gave me is a kick in.
[30:24.920 --> 30:31.920]  That was purple punch, by the way.
[30:31.920 --> 30:34.920]  Oh, you got high off purple punch.
[30:34.920 --> 30:38.920]  You know, I did a bit of trolling a little bit because I can't help myself.
[30:38.920 --> 30:41.920]  Always a class clown. And everyone's like, what is the strain?
[30:41.920 --> 30:46.920]  And I kept telling everybody glue dream and people were believing me.
[30:46.920 --> 30:50.920]  I was like, I got to stop the growth going to get mad at me.
[30:50.920 --> 30:54.920]  You know, everyone's like, it's glue dream. Like what?
[30:54.920 --> 30:57.920]  Yeah, man, that's what I heard.
[30:57.920 --> 31:02.920]  Oh, it was reversed to the the strange. You don't think it you high purple punch.
[31:02.920 --> 31:07.920]  It got him. I grew it. I'm high for one winner to another.
