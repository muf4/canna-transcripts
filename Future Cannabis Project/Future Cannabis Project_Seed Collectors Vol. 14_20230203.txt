[00:00.000 --> 00:15.100]  Cheers, everybody.
[00:15.100 --> 00:18.220]  Episode 14 of the Seed Collectors.
[00:18.220 --> 00:19.220]  Hair is looking fabulous.
[00:19.220 --> 00:21.460]  That's why we're a few minutes late.
[00:21.460 --> 00:25.980]  Things you got to do, but hey, it was worth the wait.
[00:25.980 --> 00:27.300]  I don't know where to go after that.
[00:27.300 --> 00:28.300]  All right, guys.
[00:28.300 --> 00:29.300]  Thanks, everybody, for coming.
[00:29.300 --> 00:30.300]  Peace out.
[00:30.300 --> 00:31.300]  Seed Collectors, volume 14.
[00:31.300 --> 00:32.300]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:32.300 --> 00:35.780]  We've got some cool people with us tonight.
[00:35.780 --> 00:40.820]  A couple people you recognize, and we might have a couple people still popping in.
[00:40.820 --> 00:45.220]  We were trying to get through some technical stuff, but really, I was combing my hair,
[00:45.220 --> 00:46.220]  too.
[00:46.220 --> 00:48.580]  But let's go around the horn real quick and introduce ourselves.
[00:48.580 --> 00:50.900]  We'll start with kind of the familiar faces.
[00:50.900 --> 00:53.820]  Guys, I'm stoked to be talking with again.
[00:53.820 --> 00:55.220]  We'll start with you, Chef Alex.
[00:55.220 --> 00:56.220]  How you doing?
[00:56.220 --> 00:57.220]  Good.
[00:57.220 --> 00:59.100]  How are you guys doing tonight?
[00:59.100 --> 01:00.660]  Thanks for having me back on.
[01:00.660 --> 01:06.020]  Thanks for inviting these two gentlemen and the other guests along.
[01:06.020 --> 01:10.620]  I'm a passionate organic cultivator that's been on FCP, thankfully, a couple of times
[01:10.620 --> 01:16.260]  now to talk about our passion in organic practices.
[01:16.260 --> 01:21.460]  Now we are back to talk about our seed collections and plan for the growing season and the different
[01:21.460 --> 01:23.860]  genetics that we're going to dig into.
[01:23.860 --> 01:25.540]  So excited to be here.
[01:25.540 --> 01:26.540]  Yeah.
[01:26.540 --> 01:29.380]  Going to have some good times.
[01:29.460 --> 01:32.980]  And John, another repeat guest here.
[01:32.980 --> 01:34.500]  Thank you for joining us tonight.
[01:34.500 --> 01:35.620]  How you been?
[01:35.620 --> 01:41.260]  I've been fabulous, and I'm really over the moon for you guys having us back again.
[01:41.260 --> 01:46.820]  And really, kudos to you and Peter and everybody that works behind the scenes for this program,
[01:46.820 --> 01:53.860]  for this platform to really promote our favorite master plant, our passion for this favorite
[01:53.860 --> 01:56.780]  master plant.
[01:56.780 --> 02:00.540]  And I'm so happy to be able to...
[02:00.540 --> 02:06.700]  Shep and I have been kind of on this going everywhere, doing things, and meeting all
[02:06.700 --> 02:08.780]  these wonderful people.
[02:08.780 --> 02:13.900]  And I'm so stoked to be able to introduce other people that we've met on our journey
[02:13.900 --> 02:18.700]  who really feel that are putting in the work, are living it.
[02:18.700 --> 02:19.940]  They're living it.
[02:19.940 --> 02:25.720]  And this is what Shep and I will be manifesting, but wanted to touch on people that are actually
[02:25.720 --> 02:28.600]  doing it in the space and killing it too.
[02:28.600 --> 02:32.200]  And I appreciate you bringing more people to the conversation.
[02:32.200 --> 02:34.000]  I've thoroughly enjoyed it.
[02:34.000 --> 02:35.000]  And I think...
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.520]  Well, I want to say message and style, they can almost be interchanged here because your
[02:40.520 --> 02:42.640]  style is your message.
[02:42.640 --> 02:47.240]  And that resonates with a lot of the people here at Future Cannabis Project.
[02:47.240 --> 02:49.840]  So always a pleasure, man.
[02:49.840 --> 02:51.360]  And we've got a new face.
[02:51.360 --> 02:52.580]  New face to me.
[02:52.580 --> 02:53.580]  Very stoked.
[02:53.820 --> 02:58.060]  Well, we talked for a little bit a minute ago, but Sticky Richie, how are you doing
[02:58.060 --> 02:59.060]  today?
[02:59.060 --> 03:00.060]  Please introduce yourself.
[03:00.060 --> 03:03.660]  Hey, thanks for having me, Chad.
[03:03.660 --> 03:05.860]  Super, super excited to be here.
[03:05.860 --> 03:06.860]  My name is Rich.
[03:06.860 --> 03:11.340]  I go by Sticky Richie on Instagram.
[03:11.340 --> 03:13.260]  Lifetime home grower.
[03:13.260 --> 03:17.700]  I've been growing for, yeah, 30 years plus.
[03:17.700 --> 03:22.620]  I really absolutely love everything about the cannabis plant.
[03:22.660 --> 03:29.740]  And now currently living out the homestead life with the family and all the animals and
[03:29.740 --> 03:35.020]  trying to live the regenerative kind of lifestyle.
[03:35.020 --> 03:42.220]  I am a founding member of the Farm Bug Co-op, a craft cannabis cooperative in Massachusetts
[03:42.220 --> 03:45.260]  trying to get its licensing.
[03:45.260 --> 03:52.060]  But that's a whole other episode we could talk about for a long time about small businesses
[03:52.060 --> 03:55.660]  trying to get licensed in Massachusetts.
[03:55.660 --> 04:04.460]  But yeah, I'm super excited to be here tonight and talk about genetics and seeds and all
[04:04.460 --> 04:05.900]  those types of things.
[04:05.900 --> 04:06.900]  Nice.
[04:06.900 --> 04:07.900]  Well, thanks for joining us.
[04:07.900 --> 04:11.260]  And it looks like Mr. Cannabis Fine hops in.
[04:11.260 --> 04:12.620]  Thank you, man, for making it.
[04:12.620 --> 04:13.620]  And thanks for the extra effort.
[04:13.620 --> 04:17.380]  It looks like you've got the awesome car lighting right now.
[04:17.380 --> 04:19.380]  It's very movie cinematic.
[04:19.700 --> 04:23.700]  Yeah, actually, you sound pretty good.
[04:23.700 --> 04:27.700]  Hopefully, are we all right for you?
[04:27.700 --> 04:31.700]  Yeah, I can see three of you guys now.
[04:31.700 --> 04:35.700]  Thanks for the help, Coach.
[04:35.700 --> 04:43.460]  And yeah, in true permaculture fashion, I had to drive to service to make this happen.
[04:43.460 --> 04:47.060]  And I live on the mountain.
[04:47.140 --> 04:49.140]  There's no Wi-Fi.
[04:49.140 --> 04:51.140]  There's no service.
[04:51.140 --> 04:53.140]  So I'm here.
[04:53.140 --> 04:59.860]  And there's a hot springs down the road from my farm about 15 minutes away.
[04:59.860 --> 05:04.340]  And I am sitting outside while my cousin goes in and soaks.
[05:04.340 --> 05:06.980]  And I'm so behind on technology.
[05:06.980 --> 05:08.980]  He had to help me log in.
[05:08.980 --> 05:11.380]  Dude, that's cool.
[05:11.380 --> 05:12.380]  You know what?
[05:12.380 --> 05:13.380]  Classic farmer, though.
[05:13.380 --> 05:15.380]  You found a way to make it happen, right?
[05:15.700 --> 05:19.700]  Glad you were able to make it happen, man.
[05:19.700 --> 05:21.700]  He helped so much.
[05:21.700 --> 05:25.700]  So yeah, really thankful for Chef Alex, man.
[05:25.700 --> 05:31.700]  He's been walking me through my technology stumbles this whole time.
[05:31.700 --> 05:33.700]  He's definitely the MVP.
[05:33.700 --> 05:37.700]  Well, yeah, so I realize your time is probably a little bit limited there.
[05:37.700 --> 05:41.700]  You don't want your guy to turn into a prune.
[05:42.020 --> 05:48.020]  So definitely feel free to jump in on any point of the conversations here.
[05:48.020 --> 05:50.020]  We usually see collections.
[05:50.020 --> 05:52.020]  We just kind of go around.
[05:52.020 --> 05:54.020]  We pull out some new packs.
[05:54.020 --> 05:56.020]  We kind of tell some stories about them.
[05:56.020 --> 06:00.020]  But we always start every episode with a new T-shirt.
[06:00.020 --> 06:04.020]  Because our co-host Dave is not here tonight again.
[06:04.020 --> 06:08.020]  Unfortunately, Dave has been tied up the last few episodes.
[06:08.020 --> 06:10.020]  But his heart is here.
[06:10.340 --> 06:12.340]  He's going to be here for a couple minutes this evening.
[06:12.340 --> 06:16.340]  But he's like the master collector here.
[06:16.340 --> 06:18.340]  He's always got the packs.
[06:18.340 --> 06:20.340]  So I usually have to come with something different.
[06:20.340 --> 06:22.340]  I always come with T-shirts.
[06:22.340 --> 06:24.340]  And it's been 14 episodes.
[06:24.340 --> 06:28.340]  And I've run out of T-shirts from new places.
[06:28.340 --> 06:30.340]  So I finally did it.
[06:30.340 --> 06:32.340]  I finally had to do it.
[06:32.340 --> 06:34.340]  I'm wearing my own shirt today, guys.
[06:34.340 --> 06:36.340]  But we got the Twin Peaks cannabis shirt this week.
[06:36.340 --> 06:38.340]  This episode.
[06:38.660 --> 06:40.660]  That's my shirt.
[06:40.660 --> 06:42.660]  But we definitely do.
[06:42.660 --> 06:44.660]  I'm going to put myself big in.
[06:44.660 --> 06:46.660]  We definitely do have some seeds to go through.
[06:46.660 --> 06:48.660]  But we also have some seeds to give away.
[06:48.660 --> 06:50.660]  We've got Mirror Seeds.
[06:50.660 --> 06:52.660]  They sent us out a bunch of packs.
[06:52.660 --> 06:54.660]  So we're going to give away some packs at some point.
[06:54.660 --> 06:56.660]  Probably a little bit later this evening.
[06:56.660 --> 06:58.660]  So stay tuned and tell a friend.
[06:58.660 --> 07:00.660]  Or maybe don't tell a friend.
[07:00.660 --> 07:02.660]  And you'll have better chances.
[07:02.660 --> 07:04.660]  Who knows?
[07:04.660 --> 07:06.660]  Come on.
[07:06.980 --> 07:08.980]  With packs.
[07:08.980 --> 07:10.980]  Let's go with something new.
[07:10.980 --> 07:12.980]  And again, chat.
[07:12.980 --> 07:14.980]  I'll be looking to you guys.
[07:14.980 --> 07:16.980]  If you want to take it any direction, let us know.
[07:16.980 --> 07:18.980]  Tell us what we should pull out.
[07:18.980 --> 07:20.980]  It's a family show, guys.
[07:20.980 --> 07:22.980]  Maybe Joshua can tell them about this 13 Ghost of his.
[07:22.980 --> 07:24.980]  This beautiful fire rosin.
[07:24.980 --> 07:26.980]  That we first met him at the Hashishin Workshop with Kimberly.
[07:26.980 --> 07:28.980]  And we were talking about it.
[07:28.980 --> 07:30.980]  And we were talking about it.
[07:30.980 --> 07:32.980]  And we were talking about it.
[07:32.980 --> 07:34.980]  And we were talking about it.
[07:35.060 --> 07:37.060]  And we were talking about it.
[07:37.060 --> 07:39.060]  And we were talking about it.
[07:39.060 --> 07:41.060]  So we met up with Kimberly,
[07:41.060 --> 07:43.060]  Madame Cannoli and Cherryblossom Belle.
[07:43.060 --> 07:45.060]  Oh, wow.
[07:45.060 --> 07:47.060]  And that meeting was the rest is history.
[07:47.060 --> 07:49.060]  Yeah, let's hear about that.
[07:49.060 --> 07:51.060]  So this was one of the
[07:51.060 --> 07:53.060]  Madame Cannoli Workshops?
[07:53.060 --> 07:55.060]  Or was this with Frenchie?
[07:55.060 --> 07:57.060]  Was this at one of the movie premieres?
[07:57.060 --> 07:59.060]  This was in Long Island.
[07:59.060 --> 08:01.060]  Go on.
[08:01.060 --> 08:03.060]  No, I want to let you talk.
[08:03.060 --> 08:09.060]  I wanted to bring you guys to showcase all these wonderful vibrant people out there in this space that are really like doing it and
[08:09.060 --> 08:12.460]  With heart and with with the planet and patient in mind
[08:14.020 --> 08:17.180]  Yeah, okay, so I'm happy to be here
[08:17.180 --> 08:23.900]  Thank you, everybody that has put my name out there to bring me on the show and to the host really grateful
[08:23.900 --> 08:25.900]  so what a pleasure I
[08:26.620 --> 08:30.140]  Didn't understand the context of the conversation
[08:30.140 --> 08:38.020]  but I've been I've been in farming my whole life with both sides of my family and I've been in cannabis farming for
[08:40.060 --> 08:42.060]  15 years and
[08:42.500 --> 08:44.500]  like at scale and
[08:46.700 --> 08:50.140]  I've been collecting seeds for a long time and tonight
[08:50.140 --> 08:54.500]  I even picked up my seed vault and was like, I'm gonna go photograph it upstairs
[08:54.500 --> 08:56.860]  And I was like, why am I gonna do that?
[08:57.860 --> 09:03.020]  Pack of seeds from a friend of mine that I have access to the kind of the back doors or speed jump
[09:03.740 --> 09:05.020]  so
[09:05.020 --> 09:13.140]  Into that conversation. Why kind of brought that up was that was just a conversation today. I went to go purchase like a
[09:13.660 --> 09:17.940]  lot of seeds like maybe a few hundred seeds from a seed junkie contact and
[09:18.740 --> 09:23.300]  The person was really sick and I was like, oh man, I'm really sorry. I gave him half the money
[09:23.300 --> 09:25.100]  I was like, can we please do this another time?
[09:25.100 --> 09:30.180]  So I can go through the seeds with you when you're feeling better and I can actually count them with you and talk about the
[09:30.180 --> 09:32.420]  genetics more but my
[09:33.580 --> 09:40.740]  Those 13 ghosts are from years ago. I hang out with like the cherry blossom and
[09:41.740 --> 09:44.220]  Frenchie speaking to that community Leo
[09:46.020 --> 09:50.140]  Stone shout out to Leo and a fishing Otto and
[09:50.420 --> 09:58.300]  He's a great contributor in my opinion to the genetic bank of Mendocino and now to Los Angeles and
[09:59.020 --> 10:06.100]  I had been working with him on and off and those seeds in particular came from
[10:06.620 --> 10:13.260]  and a really late night run down to humble and arcade and when he was living down there and I picked them up at a
[10:14.100 --> 10:17.460]  God, we're probably hanging out at like 11 o'clock at night smoking
[10:18.220 --> 10:20.220]  Barely made it in and
[10:20.620 --> 10:22.620]  the 13 ghost is
[10:23.180 --> 10:27.540]  Something that they've been working for a long time. They like the ghost OG line and
[10:29.500 --> 10:36.660]  It just like it's the ghost OG on the creme brulee from archive and that's a one of my favorites and
[10:39.100 --> 10:46.340]  It's something that I'd grown years past it had like beautiful cookie spears and gas beers and it's a
[10:47.780 --> 10:49.780]  cookies on an OG and
[10:49.940 --> 10:52.040]  It's then on the Louis the eighth
[10:52.900 --> 10:59.460]  OG which I don't have very much experience with and so that that was the 13 ghosts the plant
[10:59.540 --> 11:01.540]  I've grown maybe like
[11:01.700 --> 11:09.420]  30 females at this point and I still hold the one cut that I grow. It's like a very cream gas strong
[11:10.340 --> 11:13.620]  phenotype the highs like very electric and it's
[11:14.620 --> 11:20.900]  It's in the mid 20s like 23 to 25 percent and it makes about 3%
[11:21.500 --> 11:26.460]  rosin, so I really have always really enjoyed the cultivar and
[11:27.100 --> 11:34.100]  that's the 13 ghosts and just like a quick story of how I got to those genetics and
[11:34.500 --> 11:37.240]  I always like to grow out phenos
[11:37.240 --> 11:44.280]  I've got a seed vault of like thousands of seeds from some of the top breeders in the industry that I've been collecting over the
[11:44.280 --> 11:46.280]  last decade
[11:47.960 --> 11:53.440]  That's awesome man, thank you for sharing that story I appreciate it and that's definitely what we're here to do
[11:54.480 --> 11:56.120]  you know a
[11:56.120 --> 11:58.760]  Lot of people are interested in that history
[11:58.760 --> 12:05.020]  So that's something that we tried to do through the show now you mentioned seed junkies and that you you collected a lot of the
[12:05.140 --> 12:09.600]  Seedjunkie stuff. What is it maybe about them that kind of drew you in?
[12:13.340 --> 12:15.340]  Straw Nana papaya
[12:23.380 --> 12:25.380]  Someone's got through there's faster
[12:25.900 --> 12:32.500]  Yeah, it's delicious. It's mouth. It's lip-smacking. Thank you so much for the stewardship of your land Joshua
[12:32.860 --> 12:34.860]  But phenomenal
[12:34.980 --> 12:37.940]  Appreciate the support you guys makes me
[12:45.100 --> 12:47.100]  What was the question again
[12:47.420 --> 12:52.020]  It's just you know, you mentioned seed junkies and you were gonna pick up, you know go through
[12:52.660 --> 12:59.940]  Selections. What what is it that you kind of like about them or the particular, you know strains that you were going for?
[13:00.580 --> 13:06.300]  Well, if I want to be sneaky about it man, and if I just wanted to like just have an easy career
[13:06.300 --> 13:08.900]  I would just grow wedding cake. Okay
[13:09.380 --> 13:13.900]  the special rare kind of wedding cake that does very well
[13:14.660 --> 13:22.140]  produces hash and grown correctly and my area has always sold really really really well and still does to this day and
[13:22.340 --> 13:27.220]  all forms rosin hashish and in flower or
[13:27.660 --> 13:32.700]  So I just was always a fan because I saw wedding cake is like a benchmark of the decade
[13:32.700 --> 13:36.220]  I don't think there's been a lot of weed that is bread
[13:36.940 --> 13:44.020]  Then said it's stronger. I think that the terpenes have improved with the introduction of skittles and
[13:44.660 --> 13:51.540]  Yeah with the introduction of skittles, but the wedding cake itself. I've just always seen as like one of the true
[13:54.860 --> 13:56.620]  Legacy
[13:56.620 --> 14:00.740]  cuts out of the emerald triangle out of the emerald cup and
[14:01.300 --> 14:07.140]  so I still grow that cut of the wedding cake from seed junkie in it, I
[14:08.140 --> 14:14.580]  Don't think I have anything yet. That's better. I do think that they have stuff out there that has come close
[14:15.700 --> 14:18.660]  So I'm always surfing the front of their catalog
[14:19.380 --> 14:23.100]  catching new cultivars in hope of like
[14:23.820 --> 14:28.220]  Finding something like that wedding cake cut that's just somewhat unique as well
[14:28.540 --> 14:33.860]  The reason why like growing wedding cake at scale with that cut can be challenging
[14:34.500 --> 14:41.360]  It's an old cut. It really needs to be revitalized. It doesn't cut. Well, it just kind of has issues
[14:41.980 --> 14:44.020]  It's always been that way for us
[14:44.020 --> 14:49.700]  but this is a cut out of the rosin community out of the original third gen community and
[14:50.300 --> 14:51.900]  that was a
[14:51.900 --> 14:57.620]  Wedding cake cut from that origin that it's a hat. It's a rosin cut and I really really like it
[14:57.620 --> 15:02.660]  so now I've pulled a few cut sense like a a
[15:04.980 --> 15:06.140]  Secret mince
[15:06.140 --> 15:10.000]  That's a really beautiful cultivar from seed junkie
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.300]  And I've just now started purchasing back into their catalog
[15:14.620 --> 15:20.180]  so I like their varieties because they're strong because of their strength and
[15:21.140 --> 15:23.140]  Because they make good Rosson a
[15:25.100 --> 15:29.260]  Lot of people that is their primary and goal these days
[15:29.660 --> 15:35.220]  Well, yeah potency and rosin. So rosin you kind of tend to get that. I mean
[15:35.900 --> 15:40.940]  Regardless of starting material, but this is the cherry mints you gave me when I first met you
[15:40.940 --> 15:42.940]  I smoked all the
[15:42.940 --> 15:48.100]  Remember you gave me this look at how I look or look at how it still looks dude
[15:49.100 --> 15:51.100]  How old is that
[15:55.900 --> 16:03.060]  Yeah, I mean that was made over a year ago and it's rosin
[16:09.060 --> 16:11.060]  From the season before last
[16:12.060 --> 16:18.020]  Yeah, that's right, I think that that's truly the beauty of living soil is it's
[16:18.620 --> 16:21.860]  everything in the product stays more vital and
[16:22.420 --> 16:24.420]  lives like
[16:24.420 --> 16:27.360]  Longer the flower it cures and ages
[16:27.820 --> 16:29.100]  to
[16:29.100 --> 16:34.900]  Perfection like months later than other varieties. So it gets like more time to build that complexity
[16:34.900 --> 16:39.940]  I work in a basement and in a cellar. So I'm very focused on the cure and
[16:41.060 --> 16:45.700]  It's the same in the hash and the rosin you see its longevity
[16:46.020 --> 16:52.300]  and I know that now after years of watching this to be the the living soil and
[16:54.620 --> 16:56.620]  This farm is a
[16:56.660 --> 16:59.340]  It's a 20 year cannabis farm
[17:00.140 --> 17:03.880]  Maybe 17 year cannabis farm and I've had it
[17:03.880 --> 17:09.900]  It's a organic cannabis farm for 17 years and then I've been operating it no till for the last seven years
[17:10.420 --> 17:12.420]  And with
[17:12.500 --> 17:19.940]  Not closed loop all the time last year. I was closed loop the whole time. I'd say it's 30 years. I'm fully closed loop and
[17:21.540 --> 17:23.540]  Utilizing KNF permaculture
[17:24.220 --> 17:25.700]  and also
[17:25.700 --> 17:29.500]  biodynamic practices along with like the Northern California
[17:29.500 --> 17:33.060]  Well the California organic movement practices and Hawaii
[17:33.900 --> 17:40.980]  Organic movement practices of the seven you and Richie need to hang out because you guys are like, that's why it's like
[17:41.540 --> 17:43.820]  Amazing. I just want to say like I love you guys
[17:50.940 --> 17:55.340]  Getting into FCP, but he wishes he could be in here and he said he'd try as well
[17:55.340 --> 17:57.580]  But he also, you know, he definitely
[17:58.380 --> 18:00.380]  Says much. Love y'all
[18:00.900 --> 18:03.700]  Right on that's Cape Neddick sun-grown
[18:05.220 --> 18:07.220]  Sun-grown on the East Coast that would be
[18:08.500 --> 18:10.140]  station as well
[18:10.140 --> 18:13.100]  but yeah, I want to stay on the wedding cake real quick because
[18:13.660 --> 18:15.220]  You know wedding cake
[18:15.220 --> 18:21.180]  There's a lot of new markets and for a lot of people wedding cake is brand new like this is the hot stuff
[18:21.180 --> 18:25.100]  That's just here. You mentioned this came out of the triangle now
[18:25.100 --> 18:31.300]  It's amazing how things tend to be around sometimes for it's almost like music stars, man
[18:31.300 --> 18:36.420]  You're around for like 10 years and all of a sudden you get a hit and people are like you're the hottest new artist
[18:37.020 --> 18:42.500]  When did this wedding cake like come around to you or how long or how long do you remember it?
[18:42.500 --> 18:47.020]  And then since I've never I've never had the you know, the wedding cake cut special cut
[18:47.500 --> 18:51.420]  Can you maybe tell us what it is that just like stands out about that?
[18:52.220 --> 18:58.740]  Yeah to some of the other ones yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so I think it's like seven years about
[18:59.260 --> 19:01.460]  I'm trying to recall I've been
[19:04.020 --> 19:07.220]  I've been around the cut for probably five
[19:08.260 --> 19:10.260]  years or so
[19:10.500 --> 19:14.700]  Growing up in a community at Southern Oregon in the Northern Triangle
[19:15.380 --> 19:17.740]  As kids we grew up smoking all the weed
[19:17.740 --> 19:21.420]  We always had options to try different stuff
[19:21.420 --> 19:25.780]  then we went to the farmers and trim for the farmers as teenagers and
[19:26.740 --> 19:32.220]  so like certain people that I grew up with developed palates and
[19:34.020 --> 19:39.560]  You knew that they knew the flavor you knew that they knew the strength of something so like when the wedding cake
[19:40.560 --> 19:47.560]  Don't drain your battery to we can go like National Geographic like I did a crime mode
[19:52.560 --> 20:00.040]  So when the wedding cake first like showed up all those years ago that one of those people that had that
[20:00.720 --> 20:03.880]  That had that really kind of that fine palette
[20:03.880 --> 20:06.480]  And you heard the whispers and I knew it was true
[20:07.680 --> 20:13.320]  And what made these variety these cultivars so special when they were first introduced is like
[20:14.640 --> 20:17.880]  It reintroduced like a new genetic
[20:19.520 --> 20:21.520]  Profile that
[20:21.880 --> 20:27.040]  Was so strong and so unique in terpenes and in characteristics that
[20:27.200 --> 20:33.080]  Those are the really memorable qualities that became those benchmark those those
[20:34.280 --> 20:40.400]  Lemon kush those blue dream varieties like they had beautiful resin beautiful terpenes beautiful
[20:40.400 --> 20:44.300]  Hi, they all have strong cannabinoids the Jaeger
[20:44.840 --> 20:46.840]  I have to say the Jaeger
[20:47.640 --> 20:51.600]  I'm not gonna say it again. I'm not gonna say it again. I'm not gonna say it again
[20:51.600 --> 20:53.600]  I
[20:53.600 --> 20:59.000]  Have to say the Jaeger that's for my area and so the wedding cake was very special in that way
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.640]  but she was very finicky like 10 week variety and
[21:02.640 --> 21:07.440]  The clones were hard to take like she's always been a little more difficult
[21:07.760 --> 21:09.760]  But now getting back to the genetics
[21:09.760 --> 21:15.960]  So when you have the original batch of seed and you have these varieties that like the very first skittles
[21:15.960 --> 21:20.480]  First off we couldn't get to skittles for the for the when it was first introduced to the at the cup
[21:20.480 --> 21:24.880]  They were guarding the genetics. They had bred it in but it wasn't easy to crack
[21:24.880 --> 21:29.480]  Yeah, like it is a lot easier to get today. But with the wedding cake and
[21:30.280 --> 21:32.280]  You get the first batch of those seeds
[21:32.400 --> 21:39.440]  So now that's the genetics that won that cup and what will happen then is maybe that breeder made
[21:39.440 --> 21:42.560]  I can't say but like a thousand seeds
[21:42.560 --> 21:49.840]  No matter what they sell out and now they're breeding the lineage again to keep that variety on the market
[21:49.840 --> 21:52.720]  so that wedding cake now in order for it to
[21:53.240 --> 22:01.040]  Continually stay as a viable seed on the open market because like we're not dealing with organized genetics where you know
[22:01.040 --> 22:05.440]  We're following stuff out ten years twenty years and then introducing it to market
[22:05.440 --> 22:09.640]  Like the vegetable farmers have to do it. So it's a little bit more complicated
[22:09.640 --> 22:16.680]  Introducing it to market like the vegetable farmers have to do to introduce an heirloom to a vegetable catalog, right?
[22:16.680 --> 22:19.480]  We're just taking this like who knows f1 whatever
[22:20.160 --> 22:24.860]  Random that comes and then that becomes that genetic benchmark for that wedding cake
[22:25.060 --> 22:31.600]  So now to keep it they keep breeding it and the longer it's continually bred
[22:31.920 --> 22:37.920]  It will start losing its quality and so you'll get some seed companies that will buy those original batches
[22:37.920 --> 22:41.120]  Then they'll do their own breeding and you can purchase into those as well
[22:41.760 --> 22:45.320]  however that original that origin point where that
[22:45.960 --> 22:47.960]  cultivar what became
[22:48.480 --> 22:51.400]  No, no to rot became like notice
[22:52.040 --> 22:56.000]  it's a rid that genetic origin is really important and
[22:56.920 --> 22:58.760]  that cut that I
[22:58.760 --> 23:01.040]  Like to farm and I love to smoke
[23:01.680 --> 23:04.440]  Like really a lot. It's probably my favorite
[23:05.040 --> 23:07.000]  That
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.280]  cultivar
[23:08.280 --> 23:13.040]  that's what I consider to be like the true pedigree cut and
[23:14.120 --> 23:20.280]  That's what out here out west in that in the Emerald Triangle at that genetic level
[23:20.680 --> 23:26.840]  That's what we're really obsessed with and that's what the breeders like. No 100%
[23:27.560 --> 23:34.300]  Did were those ever available as like regular seeds or was it a femme
[23:34.940 --> 23:38.380]  Only or was it just kind of clone only and then it got turned
[23:38.380 --> 23:38.900]  No
[23:38.900 --> 23:45.900]  I think that there was it was clone only at first and then the seeds became available as far as I recall
[23:46.300 --> 23:49.260]  But I don't I don't remember exactly
[23:52.780 --> 23:54.940]  Yeah, you said triangle the triangle up
[23:55.100 --> 24:00.860]  Triangle mints, I believe is the pack that it came out of it's the triangle cush to animal mints
[24:01.900 --> 24:03.900]  Yeah, that's what they say. Okay
[24:05.340 --> 24:07.340]  Like cookies on cookies to the team
[24:07.980 --> 24:13.580]  It's funny because that's why I grin when you said that I was like, oh man TK is like
[24:13.900 --> 24:20.220]  That's one of my favorite ogs because of exactly how you're describing that and it was like music to my ears
[24:21.020 --> 24:23.020]  But yeah, I think it was like a triangle
[24:23.100 --> 24:28.460]  About maybe four years five years ago. I saw it for the first time and
[24:29.340 --> 24:33.420]  I got it and ran it out and I was floored by the
[24:34.860 --> 24:38.860]  Resin quality. It was incredible right off the bat. It stood out or
[24:39.820 --> 24:42.140]  Just coated it was beautiful. I remember
[24:43.820 --> 24:46.380]  Going to the store and I was like, oh, I want to buy this
[24:47.340 --> 24:49.340]  And
[24:49.340 --> 24:51.340]  I handed some to
[24:51.900 --> 24:58.460]  Another mask guy at the time hotel herb and I remember he was just pumped about it. It was great
[24:58.460 --> 25:00.860]  Um, it was the first time I met him
[25:00.860 --> 25:06.220]  So that was about through the my the cut I had of the wedding cake at the time and I remember
[25:06.780 --> 25:08.780]  I was like, oh, I want to buy this
[25:09.420 --> 25:11.420]  And I was like, oh, I want to buy this
[25:11.420 --> 25:14.380]  So
[25:41.900 --> 25:47.740]  It is tricky and I ended up losing the cut, um trying to juggle too many things and um
[25:48.060 --> 25:50.060]  I don't have that anymore
[25:50.380 --> 25:54.300]  but uh in a seat order that I recently made to um
[25:54.940 --> 26:01.980]  Csi humble he was happy or cool enough to send in a bunch of free stuff and a couple of them were uh,
[26:02.620 --> 26:03.980]  nice
[26:03.980 --> 26:09.580]  Wedding cake times apple fritter. Oh snaps and uh, one of my favorite
[26:10.220 --> 26:12.860]  Um turf profiles is sherbert
[26:13.900 --> 26:15.900]  Sure times wedding cake
[26:16.380 --> 26:17.740]  so
[26:17.740 --> 26:21.420]  I already popped the wedding cake times apple fritters because I heard
[26:22.460 --> 26:24.460]  uh the apple fritter
[26:24.540 --> 26:30.620]  I'm, just really interested in that apple fritter and all it has to offer. I haven't had a chance to get into it yet
[26:30.700 --> 26:32.940]  But anyways the wedding cake. Yeah, um
[26:33.500 --> 26:34.860]  so
[26:34.860 --> 26:37.260]  We I have those seeds as well from um
[26:38.220 --> 26:45.420]  From uh, c junkie the apple fritter on the wedding cake. Oh nice. Yeah, this is uh,
[26:46.380 --> 26:47.740]  um
[26:47.740 --> 26:49.740]  inspectors version of that
[26:49.900 --> 26:51.500]  cross yeah
[26:51.500 --> 26:52.620]  cool
[26:52.620 --> 26:54.620]  and that's awesome because
[26:54.940 --> 27:01.180]  He gets he gets the cuts and really is able to do those things with a blessing, you know
[27:01.260 --> 27:04.940]  And that's very important because that helps me at least feel better
[27:05.580 --> 27:12.540]  That it is what it is when I get it and he is generous boy and with it's really great. He's quite uh,
[27:13.260 --> 27:15.260]  uh a resource for all of us
[27:16.540 --> 27:18.540]  Yes, I love those
[27:19.180 --> 27:24.060]  Yep, I ended up um, I only bought it. I bought one pack of seeds which was to um,
[27:24.700 --> 27:27.020]  Get down a bubble gum
[27:27.500 --> 27:30.220]  Um rabbit hole I was trying to explore again
[27:30.620 --> 27:34.960]  And he's uh, which was this pack I bought which was the headband
[27:36.220 --> 27:38.220]  bubble gum that looks
[27:39.660 --> 27:45.740]  That's got a lot of potential and he started throwing in a bunch of other stuff, you know, like the hash plant
[27:46.440 --> 27:48.440]  13 times the bubble gum
[27:49.100 --> 27:50.300]  Wow
[27:50.300 --> 27:55.820]  So I have a bunch of bubble gum type stuff to go into now and to start. Oh and one more
[27:55.900 --> 27:57.900]  He gave me some regular seeds
[27:58.460 --> 28:00.460]  Which was uh
[28:01.020 --> 28:03.020]  Right here
[28:03.900 --> 28:05.900]  Which are
[28:06.940 --> 28:11.340]  The emerald triangle, okay pink and perks times bubble gum
[28:12.700 --> 28:18.380]  Just a few regular few regular seeds. I'm not even sure what the pink and perks is to be honest with you, but
[28:18.860 --> 28:23.100]  Yeah, i'm curious myself. I wonder what the pink is. It's are you using mails?
[28:23.100 --> 28:27.340]  Do I use mail yeah, are you saving
[28:29.740 --> 28:35.020]  Just to watch them out for a while, yeah, and most of his stuff is all feminized though, correct? Yeah
[28:35.740 --> 28:40.240]  That's why these were uh interesting to me the regs. Yeah regulars
[28:42.540 --> 28:46.140]  Now without being too much what
[28:46.620 --> 28:51.900]  What what is this bubble gum from th seeds, uh adam done
[28:53.020 --> 28:57.900]  He supposedly was the one who kind of uh brought it to amsterdam
[28:57.980 --> 28:59.980]  I'm, not saying like he's the one that bred it
[28:59.980 --> 29:04.700]  But he supposedly brought it to amsterdam and then for what I understand sold it to a bunch of seed banks
[29:05.260 --> 29:11.580]  But there's the indiana bubble gum and then there's something else and then some other story, right? I mean, I I don't know
[29:11.820 --> 29:17.020]  No, i'm curious the difference maybe these other gentlemen might know it seems like chad has a pretty good, uh,
[29:18.540 --> 29:20.540]  You seem to know about adams
[29:22.540 --> 29:26.540]  I yeah, well like any good strain. I know there's many stories
[29:26.620 --> 29:32.540]  There is the indiana bubble gum, which I hear a lot then I hear some people from ohio who's like all our bubble gum
[29:33.180 --> 29:35.260]  But I don't know if it's because of the bubble gum
[29:36.140 --> 29:41.980]  Which I hear a lot then I hear some people from ohio who's like all our bubble gum, um
[29:42.940 --> 29:47.100]  I imagine florida somewhere in the game, too. No, I don't know that for real, but it's gotta be
[29:47.820 --> 29:51.900]  Different. They wouldn't call it indiana versus just bubble gum then right?
[29:52.620 --> 29:57.180]  Right. Well, I think I you know, I think it's almost like strawberry koth like kyle kushman
[29:57.180 --> 30:00.780]  It's like kyle kushman didn't make that but he's the one who got it out
[30:00.940 --> 30:04.860]  And that's why I know adam dunn's and bubble gum to get together
[30:05.340 --> 30:09.020]  uh, just because there's some some seed banks over in
[30:09.800 --> 30:12.620]  Amsterdam that that's like their staple. That's the
[30:13.420 --> 30:17.900]  It's crazy. The dutch will actually work lines and sit there and stabilize things. So
[30:18.700 --> 30:24.540]  That that's one of them from over there, but I don't know cannabis fine. Have you ever had your experience with a bubble gum?
[30:26.540 --> 30:34.140]  No, I haven't and uh, i'm i'm of a i'm of a strong opinion of the whole amsterdam scene
[30:34.940 --> 30:38.140]  Uh from some books that i've read and a friend of mine
[30:38.780 --> 30:40.460]  um out of the
[30:40.460 --> 30:45.500]  hash smuggling era from the 1960s and 70s and 80s and uh
[30:47.660 --> 30:53.020]  Yeah, yeah, so that that's more I feel like as soon as you guys started talking about I was like, you know
[30:53.020 --> 30:55.020]  I think that's more east coast
[30:55.260 --> 30:59.440]  Um, but again, I have like a strong opinion on the whole amsterdam genetics
[31:00.000 --> 31:04.560]  And I I'd love to hear it if you feel like sharing it
[31:06.400 --> 31:10.160]  Yeah, yeah, so, um first, um
[31:11.520 --> 31:15.680]  Joseph p etri is his name. He's a good writer
[31:16.640 --> 31:18.640]  I know who that is
[31:18.800 --> 31:20.800]  the king of ash
[31:21.200 --> 31:25.060]  Yeah, so I follow his conversation
[31:25.760 --> 31:27.280]  on
[31:27.280 --> 31:29.280]  um
[31:29.500 --> 31:30.960]  Amsterdam
[31:30.960 --> 31:33.440]  Are you familiar with it? Have you read his book?
[31:34.160 --> 31:38.320]  I would if involving that guy i'd just say let's move on to the next topic
[31:39.680 --> 31:45.360]  To be completely honest, uh, okay. What do you have to say about joe pietri?
[31:47.520 --> 31:49.520]  A lot of
[31:50.960 --> 31:56.800]  A lot of his stories are unverifiable and he slings a lot of shit at an accredited stories
[31:57.680 --> 32:00.080]  Somewhere in the middle I imagine lies the truth
[32:01.840 --> 32:03.840]  I I I would
[32:04.240 --> 32:09.200]  find a fair opinion of that from what i've seen through the event scenes and
[32:10.400 --> 32:12.400]  Yeah, it's fair
[32:13.120 --> 32:17.920]  But he's he's also a person who was there more so than a lot of uh,
[32:18.320 --> 32:22.400]  he's he's gonna have a lot more firsthand knowledge than myself on things, but
[32:22.960 --> 32:29.200]  I i've just seen him sling shit about people who are well respected and so I I just don't touch that guy
[32:30.160 --> 32:32.160]  um
[32:32.800 --> 32:37.120]  So, yeah, sorry, sorry to cut you off. Sorry. I asked the question then i'm like nope
[32:37.680 --> 32:44.560]  but uh, no, no, that's why I presented that's why I presented the point of opinion before saying the opinion
[32:45.120 --> 32:47.840]  Yeah, go for it, man. I'm, sorry. I cut you off there. No, no, no
[32:47.920 --> 32:55.460]  I'm saying I sourced where I got it from first just to hear what you guys thought about him as as a contributor
[32:56.720 --> 33:00.400]  As well, that's why that's why I pre-faced, uh starting with that
[33:01.040 --> 33:06.400]  Um, but I do think that the amsterdam genetics are watered down. Um from
[33:07.280 --> 33:08.960]  Why when I heard?
[33:08.960 --> 33:14.100]  Joseph's, uh when I read joseph saying that that the that the genetics have been incepted
[33:14.900 --> 33:23.060]  By the federal government and that they were watering them down with the skunk lineages and the ruderalis lineages to get them to trigger earlier
[33:23.620 --> 33:24.900]  um
[33:24.900 --> 33:31.860]  Growing up here in oregon around the cannabis scenes i've seen i've never ordered seeds from amsterdam, but i've watched
[33:32.980 --> 33:37.300]  I mean a hundred different farms do it at this point, you know, and
[33:38.340 --> 33:43.620]  They I never saw good weed. I never saw strong genetics. I never saw true
[33:44.180 --> 33:47.700]  Like it always lacked luster. It always lacked. Uh
[33:48.820 --> 33:50.820]  resin and terpenes
[33:51.700 --> 33:57.800]  So when I heard joseph speak about the genetics, uh being altered out of amsterdam
[33:57.860 --> 34:04.900]  I was like well in my experience from what i've watched and all the seed packs out of amsterdam being farmed at different people's farms
[34:05.700 --> 34:12.020]  That's been my experience also down in new mexico. The farmers down there were using the amsterdam seed packs like
[34:12.580 --> 34:20.100]  Almost exclusively from what I could see when I uh first started seeing the outdoor scene down there a long time ago
[34:20.740 --> 34:23.860]  And so i've seen a lot of it and I just have never
[34:25.540 --> 34:27.540]  Never seen anything that I liked
[34:28.740 --> 34:31.620]  I'd have to agree a hundred percent with that
[34:31.780 --> 34:37.860]  Like I I do believe that a lot of those genetics are watered down and I think a lot of the companies have
[34:38.260 --> 34:45.460]  Through raids or whatnot lost the original stock lost the original parents and i've tried to recreate a lot of these things
[34:46.180 --> 34:48.100]  um, but yeah
[34:48.100 --> 34:50.500]  and and the white labeling too like I have a
[34:50.900 --> 34:54.820]  I I tend to have a distrust and this is probably where me and joe absolutely agree
[34:54.980 --> 34:59.060]  Is I tend to have a distrust of a lot of the companies out in spain?
[34:59.620 --> 35:02.740]  Uh, some of the ones in the netherlands just for white labeling
[35:03.220 --> 35:09.940]  um, we all know even in america how easy it is just to slap a name on a on a seed pack or a clone and
[35:10.020 --> 35:12.020]  Call it is what it is. So
[35:12.820 --> 35:14.820]  Yeah, man. I I
[35:15.620 --> 35:17.940]  Sorry, I went down that road. But yeah, I absolutely agree
[35:18.660 --> 35:20.660]  They are probably a little watered down
[35:21.700 --> 35:25.940]  Yeah, no, it's all right. It's all right. Yeah, we're that's what we're doing. It's going down roads right now
[35:26.340 --> 35:31.220]  Yep, and I see peter in here. He's all I packed up some indiana bubblegum today
[35:31.380 --> 35:37.060]  So come on peter come on the show, bro. It's your channel. You've got the key
[35:38.100 --> 35:40.100]  um
[35:45.140 --> 35:49.460]  Oh, we couldn't hear you there chef sometimes you're broken up a little yeah
[35:51.780 --> 35:54.580]  It looks good, but we were talking I was saying where
[35:55.300 --> 36:01.450]  You
[36:02.890 --> 36:04.890]  Bakes chefs know about
[36:08.970 --> 36:10.970]  Well
[36:11.050 --> 36:13.610]  I'll say i'll say this fine neighborhood
[36:14.010 --> 36:17.530]  Bubble gum seeds if you want those I told you I have so many seeds here
[36:17.770 --> 36:20.330]  I want to see a bunch of this stuff grown on your farm. So
[36:20.970 --> 36:23.370]  If you are interested in those bubble gum, they're yours
[36:25.050 --> 36:27.050]  Like the cake
[36:27.290 --> 36:29.290]  Okay, this is from uh
[36:29.530 --> 36:31.530]  weeds out in oregon, uh
[36:31.610 --> 36:35.150]  This is what I thought I recognized that uh those genetics
[36:37.130 --> 36:39.450]  Yeah, I got a few I got a few more but uh
[36:40.250 --> 36:43.050]  The ones I pulled out today was the cali burger
[36:44.090 --> 36:46.090]  the coconut milk
[36:46.490 --> 36:48.490]  and the banana bread
[36:48.490 --> 36:51.290]  Um most excited I think out of these three
[36:52.250 --> 36:57.050]  For the banana bread, which is the banana punch crust to the white truffle
[36:58.170 --> 37:00.170]  um
[37:02.890 --> 37:05.610]  Yeah, well I have it and
[37:07.530 --> 37:11.370]  Yeah, no, that's the cereal milk to the jungle cake gmo that's going to be fouled
[37:11.930 --> 37:13.930]  Oh speaking of the cake
[37:14.170 --> 37:16.570]  The jungle cake is in there and that's what?
[37:17.530 --> 37:18.490]  Yeah
[37:18.490 --> 37:20.490]  Yeah
[37:20.490 --> 37:25.610]  I'm gonna get shameless on here because you just mentioned. Oh, I was cutting you off there. Keep going
[37:28.170 --> 37:34.170]  This no, no, no worries the cereal milk has the snowman in there and I think that's the chem dog
[37:38.730 --> 37:42.730]  It's actually headband, but they call it the chem dog sour diesel
[37:44.090 --> 37:47.530]  Uh, that's one of the parentage in the grapestopper as well
[37:48.490 --> 37:54.650]  Um, but yeah, that's one of the things that I want to get into for outdoor this year I got some new gene stuff
[37:55.450 --> 37:57.930]  That i'm going to dig into as well
[37:58.650 --> 37:59.770]  as
[37:59.770 --> 38:01.130]  some stuff from
[38:01.130 --> 38:03.130]  rich on screen right there
[38:03.450 --> 38:05.530]  And some stuff from jason who is up
[38:06.330 --> 38:11.130]  Uh, and if you're watching shout out jason, I got a few of your packs here that i'm really interested about
[38:11.770 --> 38:13.270]  uh, the
[38:14.150 --> 38:19.110]  Lime sky jar obx for the jelly roll that's got a distinct story to it
[38:23.190 --> 38:24.790]  The pina
[38:24.790 --> 38:26.790]  guava jelly for the cherry
[38:27.910 --> 38:34.150]  Cherry west is pretty damn fire by itself. I've had some of that pina. Yeah a lot of people
[38:35.270 --> 38:42.550]  In the early finisher. I've seen a lot of good farmers work with that out here and then um something from k expected that
[38:43.510 --> 38:46.150]  Jason's been working as the lemon party bx
[38:47.110 --> 38:52.090]  Three that I feel so bad for the people that google that trying to find information
[38:54.310 --> 38:56.310]  I'm just
[38:57.830 --> 38:59.830]  I got some good
[39:01.430 --> 39:02.950]  Last year
[39:02.950 --> 39:04.950]  I grew both say again
[39:05.350 --> 39:11.430]  I got some good hash genetics from ziploc seeds last year from a snow venom and a tiger's breath
[39:12.310 --> 39:13.670]  Nice, okay
[39:13.670 --> 39:17.370]  Was it he was a real good guy where I met him this year recently
[39:18.150 --> 39:20.650]  And uh, he was we had a great conversation
[39:21.830 --> 39:26.550]  Um, i'm currently popped a few of his seeds right now, which was a cross of uh,
[39:28.470 --> 39:32.710]  Uh cap junkie and something he's calling um
[39:33.830 --> 39:37.050]  ky jealousy watermelon or most sometimes jealousy
[39:37.590 --> 39:39.590]  I grew that cut
[39:40.070 --> 39:41.350]  Last year
[39:41.350 --> 39:46.710]  Oh awesome. Yeah, he was showing me pictures of it. It looks fantastic. So it's not good terpenes as well
[39:47.190 --> 39:50.390]  I walked up to him at an event last year and I was like, hey
[39:51.030 --> 39:53.750]  You look like this guy I know and he's like
[39:54.310 --> 39:57.270]  That's my twin brother. I'm like, oh my god
[39:58.230 --> 40:01.350]  your brother and I've been working cannabis for years together and
[40:01.830 --> 40:04.710]  We snowboard together him and his there's a lot of people
[40:05.270 --> 40:06.630]  and so
[40:06.630 --> 40:13.190]  We became friends instantly, of course because I was like I just was like look at him so hard i'm like man, I know you somehow
[40:14.550 --> 40:16.710]  i'm always doing weird stuff like that, but
[40:17.750 --> 40:21.910]  Always, all right. It's like how I walk through life is a weird moment to weird moment
[40:21.910 --> 40:28.870]  But then he gifted me that ky jelly cut in some seed packs at the time and that's how I grew that out last year
[40:29.510 --> 40:30.470]  and uh
[40:30.470 --> 40:35.750]  He has a great great terpene, you know for sure. I was stoked to see that he quit falling on it
[40:36.310 --> 40:42.790]  I was excited that I noticed a lot of his offerings were feminized and I was able to get uh,
[40:43.430 --> 40:47.350]  A few packs of his regular seed work. So i'm really excited about that
[40:48.070 --> 40:50.070]  Uh this special
[40:55.670 --> 41:00.650]  It's project four, uh, five one five times lemon cherry do-si-do
[41:02.310 --> 41:04.470]  Times peanut butter breath times wedding cake
[41:06.710 --> 41:09.350]  What was the what was the name of that company one more time it was
[41:10.950 --> 41:17.690]  Ziploc seeds ziploc, baby. Okay. Yeah, they're bringing the fire. How about this one gasoline lollipop?
[41:20.710 --> 41:25.190]  Gasoline lollipop, so tell me tell me about it. I have you grown that one out yet?
[41:25.750 --> 41:29.350]  No, no, this is I just blessed the brother up because I wanted to support him
[41:29.350 --> 41:34.150]  He's like dude, thank you. Now I can get home from the event. I can just play for my plane ride
[41:34.710 --> 41:39.750]  But like I like to support everybody I got boxes of stuff I got dutch's stuff I got
[41:40.470 --> 41:44.550]  You know, I want to I just popped. Um, rick richie. Um,
[41:45.350 --> 41:49.370]  Uh just gave me um, rich just gave me this, uh, pinkleberry
[41:50.470 --> 41:54.070]  F8 that he did wow and I got that I popped that with them
[41:55.510 --> 41:57.910]  The myers creek lemon degreaser project
[41:58.630 --> 42:00.630]  um and a few other things
[42:01.110 --> 42:05.190]  Shout out to to dutch blooms for that regenerative conference
[42:05.270 --> 42:09.110]  Or I would have never met any of these folks and a lot of this stuff, you know
[42:09.110 --> 42:15.670]  I wouldn't have even I was doing my own thing for a long time quietly with a really tight circle
[42:16.310 --> 42:17.670]  and um
[42:17.670 --> 42:24.390]  It wasn't until I I went out into this conference and I met so many real really like-minded folks
[42:24.950 --> 42:25.990]  and um
[42:25.990 --> 42:27.990]  Okay. Yeah. Shout out to dutch man
[42:28.310 --> 42:35.190]  Yeah, right there goes soto, you know like that project that he started is something that i'm trying to like continue on and it was
[42:35.270 --> 42:37.270]  the it was the um
[42:37.270 --> 42:39.830]  root beer times chem dog special reserve
[42:40.470 --> 42:42.070]  um that
[42:42.070 --> 42:46.550]  They made uh, well, let's see it starts back with a project from um
[42:47.350 --> 42:50.070]  The root beer is mean gene. You all know about that, right?
[42:50.630 --> 42:54.790]  And then chem dog special reserve was originally a project. Um
[42:55.750 --> 42:58.230]  You know a collaboration between uh
[42:59.030 --> 43:02.390]  Kyle kuzmin and leo stone once again, um
[43:03.190 --> 43:06.310]  and they created that chem dog special reserve and
[43:07.670 --> 43:10.470]  Somehow kevin jodrey got it and he gave
[43:11.190 --> 43:15.030]  You know, he got the cut from mean gene of the root beer. He put them together
[43:15.750 --> 43:19.670]  He gave those to dutch blooms dutch blooms made f2s out of them
[43:20.070 --> 43:25.510]  And he handed them out to everybody in the community that went to these regen conferences and he said, you know
[43:25.590 --> 43:29.270]  Do community projects with them do stuff with them and we really kind of
[43:29.990 --> 43:32.150]  Respect that, you know, and I so I kind of
[43:32.710 --> 43:37.830]  started to take that and I started to cross them towards a few different things like the
[43:39.510 --> 43:41.510]  Apples and bananas
[43:42.470 --> 43:44.470]  Okay right there
[43:44.470 --> 43:46.470]  So that's you know
[43:46.710 --> 43:48.710]  Yeah
[43:48.710 --> 43:56.890]  We got like 200 cherry reserve seeds from that era. Yeah, the new england snowblower or whatever you had something snowblower
[43:57.830 --> 44:02.870]  Cross it to the gushman. So basically we're just kind of continuing that soto effort
[44:03.590 --> 44:05.110]  um
[44:05.110 --> 44:11.110]  And I want continued hunting to find more and more the the cuts themselves are really cool. They have some
[44:11.990 --> 44:13.990]  Um root beer
[44:14.310 --> 44:18.550]  In them but more leaning towards that chem dog special reserve
[44:19.110 --> 44:23.110]  Which is a cross of chem four times stardog. Um, nice
[44:24.070 --> 44:26.230]  and you know, so those are
[44:32.470 --> 44:35.030]  I'm sorry rich, but uh while you're on it
[44:35.110 --> 44:40.230]  You said uh just recently you had a chance to chop it up with kevin and he gave you the down low on
[44:40.630 --> 44:42.630]  The chem dog special reserve, right?
[44:43.110 --> 44:47.270]  Um, and you said it was around the time I believe leo's. Um
[44:48.310 --> 44:53.110]  Past girlfriend was murdered and maybe since we have a buddy on with us
[44:53.430 --> 44:56.870]  The community might be able to get a little insight to that story. Um
[44:57.830 --> 45:02.630]  I can have you take it away from there, uh rich and then maybe joshua might have a little
[45:03.190 --> 45:04.870]  Info he can
[45:04.870 --> 45:08.150]  Fill in for us. Oh, I mean, I don't know much about that
[45:08.870 --> 45:17.430]  The back story about that incident. That's for sure. I was i'm I um, kevin was really nice enough this industry
[45:18.150 --> 45:21.430]  Let me just go on a little side note here for this business. Where else?
[45:22.870 --> 45:30.410]  Can a guy like reach out to say the one of the executives in coca-cola and ask him a question about home brewing?
[45:30.810 --> 45:35.690]  Soda and have them like literally call you back on your phone and say hey
[45:35.770 --> 45:39.530]  let's talk about this because I don't want to just text it'll take you know, and
[45:40.650 --> 45:43.050]  Stuff like that in this community people like dutch
[45:43.370 --> 45:48.810]  Opening things up people like kevin opening the doors for us to learn more and more and more
[45:49.050 --> 45:53.770]  And that that's what that call was about. It was about me asking about the lineage of the genetics
[45:53.770 --> 45:55.770]  I was trying to work with right so I
[45:56.490 --> 45:58.490]  being from the east coast
[45:58.810 --> 46:00.810]  Tem kemdog only
[46:00.970 --> 46:04.910]  Is og there's no dawg in the writing of kemdog
[46:05.370 --> 46:08.670]  From what I know right because i'm out here in massachusetts
[46:09.450 --> 46:11.290]  so when I heard
[46:11.290 --> 46:12.330]  um
[46:12.330 --> 46:14.330]  When I heard kemdog special reserve
[46:14.330 --> 46:20.250]  I scratched my head a little bit and kevin was really nice enough to tell me the full story about how it was
[46:20.330 --> 46:22.330]  So it was a combination
[46:22.970 --> 46:26.970]  Um project originally between kyle kushman and leo stone
[46:27.610 --> 46:29.690]  with the chem four and the star dog
[46:30.250 --> 46:32.250]  and I guess they picked kind of a
[46:32.570 --> 46:33.610]  real
[46:33.610 --> 46:35.050]  gassy leader
[46:35.050 --> 46:37.450]  um with that chem dog project
[46:38.730 --> 46:41.050]  Um, and you know, I I don't know much
[46:42.010 --> 46:45.290]  More than that as far as what genetics and who started that?
[46:45.530 --> 46:48.570]  Um kemdog special reserve and eventually kem
[46:49.050 --> 46:50.890]  Kevin selected one
[46:50.890 --> 46:56.810]  And he liked it a lot and other people have selected them along the line and other people have used it to work with
[46:57.450 --> 47:04.730]  I believe it's been used in black lime reserve and a bunch of other other work, you know across the board since then
[47:05.210 --> 47:08.490]  But it was new to me on the east coast. So I needed to research a little bit
[47:09.450 --> 47:11.450]  But it's a really unique
[47:12.490 --> 47:14.170]  um
[47:14.250 --> 47:16.890]  I like it. I like it a lot. I like the flavor of it
[47:17.210 --> 47:21.130]  Oh, at least what i'm getting out of it through this uh cross with the root beer
[47:23.610 --> 47:27.850]  What does it smell like to you how would you describe those turps the um those chem
[47:28.570 --> 47:30.570]  those chem dog turps
[47:30.570 --> 47:33.450]  Uh, well, I wouldn't call it. Yeah, it's more
[47:34.010 --> 47:34.970]  uh
[47:34.970 --> 47:41.130]  Star dog like I would say then um and a little bit earthier than a chem dog
[47:41.610 --> 47:43.610]  um straight chem dogs
[47:44.250 --> 47:49.770]  I wouldn't say it's that or the chem four even is more astringent and lemony. I think that um
[47:50.730 --> 47:55.850]  The chem dog special reserve is a little bit different than all of those. That's why I was you know
[47:56.470 --> 48:00.090]  Questioning it I could taste something different than the root beer with flavor
[48:00.090 --> 48:05.630]  Which I already knew but the chem notes that I was tasting weren't exactly what I was expecting
[48:06.330 --> 48:08.730]  when i'm thinking chem dog, so I
[48:09.530 --> 48:10.890]  you know
[48:10.970 --> 48:15.610]  The star dog makes a lot of sense to me because i've had this star dog and I love the um
[48:16.310 --> 48:18.570]  Illuminati cut, um that I had
[48:19.210 --> 48:25.210]  For quite a while. It is one of the best returns i've ever had on a planet even before I you know
[48:25.370 --> 48:27.610]  Um knew the importance of returns
[48:31.910 --> 48:34.170]  No, yeah to be more specific
[48:35.590 --> 48:39.350]  Sorry go on go on. No. No, I was just saying I have three soto
[48:39.830 --> 48:45.110]  Females that i'm one that i'm flowering now i'll get to see I know the chef has got a few
[48:46.230 --> 48:48.230]  now we have rick to uh, um
[48:51.270 --> 48:54.790]  What we should find sorry, but i'm i'm psyched because I think that
[48:55.590 --> 49:01.350]  Dutch when I got those when we got those seeds dutch really was interested in my purple feno of the 818 headband that i've been
[49:01.350 --> 49:03.350]  running for the past eight years because
[49:03.510 --> 49:06.550]  It when it gets older and cures it does have that
[49:07.110 --> 49:12.310]  And this root beer type of thing to it so he's like I want to bring this back and show it to mean gene
[49:12.870 --> 49:13.910]  um
[49:13.910 --> 49:16.310]  and um, but I think it you know
[49:17.590 --> 49:18.870]  yeah, so
[49:18.870 --> 49:23.530]  That my headband is that 818 headband from swerve. So it's got that sfv
[49:24.950 --> 49:27.190]  Uh og idl in there
[49:28.230 --> 49:35.590]  Yeah, I agree. I don't I really like that one. Um, I I describe this whole side of chirps as like perfumes but the uh,
[49:36.790 --> 49:39.750]  Your headband is is really really unique
[49:39.830 --> 49:44.790]  It's like on the lighter side and I think the reserve is on like the heavier funkier side of that
[49:45.430 --> 49:49.910]  And I I really like I really like that headband you have so fire. I love sweat
[49:49.910 --> 49:53.510]  well, that's why the green pheno is like it's almost like sour diesel and then
[49:54.230 --> 49:59.430]  Everything else is purple like there was only one pack that I had but that was the only one that was green
[49:59.990 --> 50:03.590]  And it was actually leo that I met at a con at at the new england
[50:03.750 --> 50:08.790]  Cannabis convention in boston at the heinz convention center. I actually got to lay some buds on him
[50:09.430 --> 50:13.030]  Um, he gave me some seeds back then I still need to get into they're old
[50:13.110 --> 50:16.550]  I remember told you about the vanilla berry pie and the forbidden candy
[50:17.110 --> 50:19.110]  Um, I grew the vanilla
[50:20.870 --> 50:22.870]  Yeah, one of the most beautiful
[50:28.390 --> 50:32.710]  Even james loud said that's like one to grow one of his favorites to grow. I remember him saying
[50:33.590 --> 50:38.170]  These are probably worth like a thousand to two thousand dollars a pack right now. Maybe they're priceless
[50:39.350 --> 50:42.790]  Those are having problems. He has very few of them. So I don't know if I have to
[50:43.410 --> 50:48.310]  Scarify them or if I have to seed crack them or I have to use be careful
[50:49.590 --> 50:52.310]  Treat them with so much. Oh, man, that's amazing
[50:53.270 --> 50:58.710]  Yeah, I have them. Uh kush kirk crossed them onto something. So I have those turps on something this year
[50:59.590 --> 51:06.710]  Nice, I yeah, I love that plant that I brought that out of the cup like seven years ago or something and it was
[51:09.110 --> 51:11.110]  Yeah
[51:15.510 --> 51:19.110]  And then there's I see the aficionado there too upside down but that's cool
[51:19.910 --> 51:25.670]  Those are the fit beginning. Is that what the the one that you're talking about in hand? I bought this from seeds here now from
[51:25.910 --> 51:26.870]  um
[51:26.870 --> 51:28.230]  james bean
[51:28.230 --> 51:30.950]  there at the end and he gave me this because
[51:31.350 --> 51:34.550]  I went to go get money at the bank machine and then he was kind of like I felt like
[51:35.350 --> 51:39.590]  You know here kid like I felt like, you know, the coke and the shirt like it was awesome
[51:40.230 --> 51:43.750]  And then I saw him the next day and I got to lay the buds on him and that's when he was like, dude
[51:44.150 --> 51:47.830]  You what is this? And I and I gave him a bud of my purple and the green
[51:48.390 --> 51:53.910]  And he was like, this is the underdog cut or this is the underdog and oh this purple
[51:53.990 --> 51:56.950]  Yeah, this is what it's normally like he's like this. Have you bred with this?
[51:56.950 --> 51:59.270]  It came from a it came from a feminized pack
[51:59.830 --> 52:00.870]  but he was like
[52:00.870 --> 52:05.270]  oh and then the next day he hit me up and said it was some of the best weed that he smoked on the east coast
[52:05.670 --> 52:08.710]  And and I didn't know if he told me if it was real or whatever
[52:08.790 --> 52:12.870]  I was like just starting to get confident like even though i've been doing it for a while
[52:12.950 --> 52:15.270]  like I was like what you know, and
[52:15.990 --> 52:18.710]  And that's actually inspired me. Um, and I
[52:19.750 --> 52:25.030]  Yeah, I I need to get like one of tony's seed crackers and crack this or do something. I know they're very old now
[52:25.670 --> 52:28.230]  Um, I tried to get into them before and then I was like, oh
[52:28.950 --> 52:30.550]  It's not working
[52:30.550 --> 52:33.110]  I don't know. Maybe we need to touch on tips on that later
[52:33.110 --> 52:38.550]  but like I i'd be happy to ask that question later because I have some too that
[52:39.270 --> 52:42.790]  I've stopped trying until there's something new for me to try
[52:43.830 --> 52:48.950]  I'm, sorry if I went off on a tangent. Um, it's really about these fellas. That was good
[52:52.190 --> 52:53.150]  But
[52:53.150 --> 52:54.510]  I got into that
[52:54.510 --> 53:00.430]  Our og and also one of those 818 heads. We're hoping to find something kind of like that and uh,
[53:00.750 --> 53:02.750]  Hopefully rich you find some
[53:02.910 --> 53:05.950]  perks like that out of that, uh sour og number one
[53:06.750 --> 53:10.350]  I got these myself from uh, mean gene recently for
[53:10.970 --> 53:13.630]  Hollywood pure kush crop to the jarro
[53:14.350 --> 53:16.350]  Oh, yeah the jarro the uh
[53:18.350 --> 53:20.350]  The sour diesel
[53:20.670 --> 53:22.670]  to the coffee og male
[53:23.310 --> 53:25.310]  I think is the hollywood
[53:25.470 --> 53:30.350]  So we do we see jarro and we see sky jarro in a lot of things
[53:30.830 --> 53:32.830]  And that's you know, then peter
[53:33.150 --> 53:36.350]  But also other people I see it being part of the crosses
[53:37.870 --> 53:38.910]  Yeah
[53:38.910 --> 53:44.990]  No, the sky comes through really good. And actually I have some sky cuddler kush rosin that jason blessed me up with. Thank you
[53:45.070 --> 53:48.430]  Jason, this is some sun-grown rosin from last season as well
[53:48.990 --> 53:54.590]  But peter, thank you peter for uh, oh the root beer freeze who got back rich
[54:09.790 --> 54:12.910]  If you say that three times does a root beer appear in your hand
[54:14.510 --> 54:16.510]  There's no place like home
[54:18.430 --> 54:20.430]  This
[54:22.030 --> 54:27.790]  Yeah, and uh, I have the gg4 lime one, uh from brandon rust that uh
[54:27.870 --> 54:33.630]  John and I have been growing for a little while now. That's just like all gas and lime. So like this jarro
[54:36.350 --> 54:40.830]  Hopefully lime and you know some that classy hashy
[54:42.190 --> 54:45.150]  Old school og peter never sends me freebies
[54:45.870 --> 54:49.470]  Jarro though his answer to that is probably order something first
[54:54.990 --> 55:00.270]  I'll even i'll kick some auto flower seeds that i've been working to towards the giveaway. I wouldn't
[55:03.790 --> 55:10.350]  I showed those last I showed those last episode the the sour stomper times. What was it?
[55:11.230 --> 55:17.310]  Chef the uh thor's hammer at four. Yes. There we go. Okay. Thank you. Let's see. Yeah
[55:17.870 --> 55:19.870]  Oh, there we go
[55:20.670 --> 55:22.670]  Okay
[55:25.470 --> 55:27.470]  In the spring for sure
[55:28.990 --> 55:30.990]  Definitely
[55:32.110 --> 55:38.030]  Part of the outdoor spring thing around here for me is getting some autos in um
[55:38.190 --> 55:40.030]  um
[55:40.030 --> 55:43.070]  I just love that process now, especially since um
[55:44.510 --> 55:46.510]  getting some of
[55:46.750 --> 55:48.030]  alex's
[55:48.030 --> 55:50.030]  seeds lot season, um
[55:50.350 --> 55:54.510]  Along with another fellow. Uh, it was the high striker farm out of maine
[55:54.750 --> 56:00.910]  They both gave me some auto seeds and I tried both of them back to back at the same time last spring and it changed
[56:00.990 --> 56:02.990]  My mind I I enjoy
[56:02.990 --> 56:04.990]  I don't mind me an auto put it that way
[56:05.950 --> 56:07.950]  In the right
[56:08.590 --> 56:09.550]  You know
[56:09.550 --> 56:16.110]  Yeah, we joke and we call it weed light like bud light. We're like man if you're not used to smoking weed. Here's some weed light
[56:16.430 --> 56:17.390]  um
[56:17.390 --> 56:20.130]  But i'm i'm consulting for a permaculture
[56:20.830 --> 56:26.510]  Project out east that's um an aravidic farm where we'll be growing all kinds of herbs and plants
[56:27.390 --> 56:29.070]  and um
[56:29.070 --> 56:30.190]  the
[56:30.190 --> 56:32.190]  so i'm looking at
[56:32.410 --> 56:36.110]  Auto flower genetics for the east coast and so i'd love to talk to you more about
[56:36.750 --> 56:42.110]  That well, why don't you just tell people what a aromatic medicine is, you know, or just briefly?
[56:43.710 --> 56:45.710]  In case people yeah, sure
[56:46.590 --> 56:52.430]  Now that I I see how how nerdy this conversation goes. I wanted to go back to the wedding cake real quick. Um,
[56:52.990 --> 56:54.990]  So the origin of that goes
[56:55.150 --> 56:59.790]  Um, yeah, I had a lot of cuts from that era and I didn't realize how spoiled I was
[57:00.350 --> 57:05.790]  Um stinky pete, he's a great extractor seed person. Um been around him for years
[57:06.110 --> 57:10.990]  He's out of the cup era and then it went resin hits. Shout out to zack. He was in a
[57:11.710 --> 57:17.470]  I mean, he was one of the very first rosin people period and he was working with uh, brandon from third gen
[57:18.270 --> 57:20.830]  At the point of origin of rosin being introduced
[57:21.550 --> 57:23.550]  during that era, so
[57:23.630 --> 57:28.610]  Um, I we were growing the banana og the wedding cake the papaya
[57:29.570 --> 57:31.730]  And also the um,
[57:33.090 --> 57:35.090]  The uh
[57:35.490 --> 57:37.250]  Peach ring
[57:37.250 --> 57:43.650]  Those were all coming out of that lineage from that group and I didn't know what I had back then
[57:44.030 --> 57:46.130]  Honestly, all right. We let those guts go
[57:47.570 --> 57:49.570]  It's the baseball card now i'm like
[57:50.690 --> 57:56.530]  Now they're totally now they're like, uh, the breeding backbone for like the new era lineage i'm like
[57:57.330 --> 57:59.330]  Wow, there you go
[57:59.650 --> 58:01.650]  That didn't make fire
[58:03.730 --> 58:07.170]  It's been spoiled living in the triangle, you know
[58:08.050 --> 58:12.850]  Well, yeah, dude, and that's you know what I say, too. I grew up in the pacific northwest
[58:12.930 --> 58:20.290]  So we always had fireweed like i'm old, but I don't know mexican brick beasters is the worst that i've had like
[58:21.090 --> 58:26.370]  There's just always good weed around man a lot of music a lot of musicians weed goes hand in hand
[58:26.850 --> 58:30.050]  But I can't imagine it's anything to that real triangle though
[58:30.610 --> 58:35.090]  It was like is it weed? Yeah, it's weed. I'll take it. We didn't have a choice back in the day, right?
[58:36.130 --> 58:38.130]  We still didn't have a choice
[58:39.010 --> 58:41.010]  Good
[58:41.410 --> 58:45.730]  Sometimes on the east coast even um your first weed can be homegrown
[58:46.050 --> 58:52.530]  Um, you know, there's some back, you know, I was raised in massachusetts, but in you go far west
[58:52.610 --> 58:56.710]  There's lots of small hill towns that are very country very small population
[58:57.330 --> 59:01.250]  with lots of people doing their own homesteading thing and um
[59:02.210 --> 59:04.690]  you know, it might have been a super long time ago, but
[59:05.650 --> 59:08.050]  I was my first inclinations were
[59:09.410 --> 59:15.490]  To know that it was something that you did you could do yourself as part of a garden type of situation
[59:15.570 --> 59:19.170]  So I was very lucky to be able to be introduced to in that fashion
[59:19.890 --> 59:21.890]  um as as
[59:22.530 --> 59:27.330]  Part of something that could be done. Um, you know, uh as a homegrown thing
[59:27.410 --> 59:32.370]  Even though it was something you couldn't ever talk about or you know, it was the whole thing
[59:32.450 --> 59:35.490]  You guys know the whole story. So it was a matter of
[59:37.710 --> 59:39.710]  Self-sufficiency
[59:40.030 --> 59:46.670]  Kind of situation, um, you know independence keeping yourself satisfied with what you knew you loved
[59:47.390 --> 59:50.510]  Yeah, and that's that's how I started making seeds as well
[59:50.590 --> 59:57.310]  It was just a preservation for my own future type of thing, but I didn't I didn't have access to cuts early on
[59:57.870 --> 59:58.910]  um
[59:58.910 --> 01:00:05.710]  once I did get medical in washington and I got a card there then I did actually have some access through that but uh,
[01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:12.510]  Yeah, no missing out on some of those older ones, uh, or the you know the wedding cake and
[01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.310]  some of the other cuts man, it's
[01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:18.190]  Is there a friend
[01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:23.170]  Still around that you could get them from if you like really had to have them again. Are you able to source them? Hopefully?
[01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:27.210]  Personally i've been lucky to
[01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:34.750]  Oh, um, i'm not sure who you're asking but I could find the one that I have because I passed it along to a few
[01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:38.590]  Friends that I know still hold it. Um
[01:00:40.110 --> 01:00:47.310]  Um as far as that kind of situation goes i've been pretty lucky, um shout out, uh elite finos out of
[01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:51.310]  Massachusetts here. He's a kind of tissue culture. Um
[01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:57.150]  Lab, he's set up for himself. Um when I first met him we were you know
[01:00:58.110 --> 01:00:59.390]  uh
[01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:01.390]  genetic nerds trading
[01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:07.070]  Genetics back and forth but through him i've been able to test tons and tons and tons of hype cuts
[01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:11.790]  so that it's been kind of like I mean tons and tons and tons, but lots of
[01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:15.150]  um a lot of all the hype cuts so i'm able to
[01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.750]  Really uh
[01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:25.950]  It's really awesome, it's really great to be able to um taste the things that I might not have chosen
[01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:27.950]  Myself
[01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:36.510]  Because of maybe their cost or prohibiting value or different ways like, you know, my taste might be going a different area
[01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:40.350]  But just to have all these ones that are really famous. Um
[01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:46.750]  Was a really blessing for me, even though I don't necessarily use them all that much. I really love
[01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:50.830]  having them in the system and uh getting to taste them and
[01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:52.590]  You know
[01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:58.370]  So being part of the experience. Yeah all along the way since legalization here in massachusetts
[01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:00.590]  it was a real like pipeline of just
[01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:05.870]  A lot of the hype genetics coming through whereas before like you said kyle
[01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:12.190]  It was a long time of just doing your own thing growing some seeds. There were no cuts. We were just kind of
[01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:15.230]  self-sustaining and watching
[01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:17.230]  You know either your genetic selection
[01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:22.670]  Um improving or falling apart into a big mess of watered down
[01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:27.630]  Genetics that you you know either had potency or didn't you just kind of went from there
[01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:32.670]  Right and and how about you cannabis fine the the cuts are they still?
[01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:36.190]  Somewhat accessible if you wanted to go back and revisit them
[01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:42.990]  Yeah, well, it's a funny conversation because like when I got these cuts years ago, um,
[01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:50.270]  Rosin wasn't uh that big of a deal. The price was way higher and every market was like, uh, what's this?
[01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:52.830]  And this is amazing
[01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:54.750]  and so
[01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.750]  Every market i've met
[01:02:57.070 --> 01:03:00.030]  In my career i've introduced it to um
[01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:04.750]  It was introduced to me at the cup through brandon and third gen
[01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:10.270]  Uh, that was my kind of eye open to it. The cherry chem was the first. Uh
[01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:17.230]  The first rosin I hit I love those genetics from south fork and love that rosin, but so my point is is
[01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:20.350]  We let those cuts go now
[01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:25.170]  Rosin is very popular honey bananas won all these national competitions
[01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:28.930]  Now these cuts are very valuable
[01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:31.870]  So yeah, I could go
[01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:33.950]  track down the breeders
[01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:39.790]  And maybe get to them if I really wanted them. I have to assume their their values like
[01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:42.270]  10 to 100 times more than they were
[01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:44.510]  seven years ago
[01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:46.510]  paying a premium
[01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:51.550]  That's it's a trip. It's a trip the whole culture's grown up a lot
[01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:56.990]  And and when you talk to the breeders the banana, oh, geez the bet is the superior one
[01:03:57.310 --> 01:03:59.970]  Honey banana is just the new era of the genetics
[01:04:01.310 --> 01:04:03.310]  We all like the banana. Oh, gee
[01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:07.790]  Yeah, we think that that's the original banana smacking
[01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:14.670]  Flavor, um, it was the weirdest planter bro. Oh my gosh a lot of these hash plants are so like
[01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:18.990]  Awkward to look at you're like wow, you really went for strange
[01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:22.590]  Are they just a lot of you just have to love them?
[01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:29.150]  Yeah, well end result. I mean the the at the end of the day the customer doesn't see the plant
[01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:32.830]  They don't necessarily care particularly if it's rosin. You don't even know
[01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:36.030]  It never gets
[01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:39.870]  A little yield
[01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:41.550]  But yeah
[01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:43.550]  Exactly. Just keep them clean
[01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:49.630]  They're a little more finicky. You got to watch them more for mold. You have to treat them with more care
[01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:52.990]  Um, but it's worth it when you see that hash come back
[01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:55.790]  um, you know sadly I
[01:04:56.910 --> 01:05:01.950]  Just lost my seven or plus year old eight year old mimosa cut
[01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:07.310]  I pulled that seed from origin from the year. It was dropped at my close friend's
[01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:10.750]  Request and we held that for a long time
[01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:16.030]  It's created some really good lineages into some of stay fly stuff into some local stuff
[01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:22.270]  We really like that. It was a great hash and rosin cut more so some of it. Yeah, I can go back to it
[01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:31.230]  But not all of it, you know, some of the stuff was really specific like we had it ourselves. It was our own precious pheno
[01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:38.590]  But you know, it's a long career and the tissue labs are just showing up and it's it's hard to hold on to these plants
[01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:40.030]  they get
[01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:44.510]  If you don't have it, perfect man, those mothers they keep getting harder and harder and harder
[01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:47.390]  Oh, man
[01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:49.790]  Let's see here I am, um
[01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:53.070]  In the background rebel grown. Let's see here
[01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:56.590]  Supernova, what is in that sticky richie?
[01:05:58.590 --> 01:06:00.590]  I'm grown
[01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:08.110]  A solid outdoor performer. It's a class of his book purple anarchy times stardust. Um
[01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:11.070]  I'm, really excited. I'm gonna pop great
[01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:17.830]  Shout out to rebel dan he's live
[01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:21.030]  with dutch on their
[01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:26.390]  Cannabis network while we're going live guys, so I know it's going to be hard to choose between
[01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:28.550]  Oh, no, everybody's
[01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:30.870]  No, i'm just but I got some good stuff, too
[01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:33.190]  natty bumpo
[01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:35.910]  From got that over to rich as well
[01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:42.890]  I got the double og. They make me hash. I got three things. They make good genetics
[01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:47.350]  Yeah
[01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:50.310]  You know, they grow well outdoors
[01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:56.230]  Uh, they're they're good genetics. I like them a lot. I've grown the sour lines. I've grown their blue dream lines
[01:06:56.230 --> 01:07:02.950]  I've grown their og lines. I've I actually am sitting on like 500 seeds of theirs right now from about
[01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:08.470]  Three or four years ago. I had a bunch of seeds of theirs that didn't pop and I called the owner
[01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:12.470]  Um, he was so respectful. He like he gifted me like
[01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:14.310]  hundreds of seeds
[01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:16.310]  Um really good company
[01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:20.950]  Fire guava that looks good real quick. Um
[01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:28.070]  We've passed an hour into the show. I want to do a giveaway real quick here. We we've been talking
[01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:30.550]  uh cakes
[01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:33.350]  Wedding cakes and again this this giveaway today
[01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:39.910]  Uh, this one is coming from mirror seeds, uh mirror seeds, uh reached out to me
[01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:47.670]  And mirror seeds is actually a group of three different breeders. They are from michigan. Uh, they've got james lee
[01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:54.070]  Uh scott town and chris mason. They've been working together for a few years making different seeds
[01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:58.550]  But they're all doing that under the uh, the mirror seeds and they just reached out said hey
[01:07:58.550 --> 01:08:01.990]  We want to send you some things I said i'm not opposed to that at all
[01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:07.510]  I want to give some away. So we're going to give some away and we'll do two batches here
[01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:12.790]  Uh two batches of two the first one since we've kind of mentioned something similar
[01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:18.710]  Uh, we're gonna go so the first batch will be black sundae, which is an ice cream cake
[01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:24.870]  We we can talk about where that fits into the wedding cake of it all but ice cream cake times black mamba
[01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:31.350]  And then the other one in that because we kind of talked about apples, uh, this one is eden secret
[01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:36.150]  It's an apple punch times black mamba. I see mr. Kazoo kush
[01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:42.070]  In the chat big ups kazoo. He has actually sent me some crosses with the black mamba as well
[01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:47.430]  And he is from michigan. So this is one of those things that may be around that area
[01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.590]  I'm excited to do that
[01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:57.430]  And i'm also excited to use the stream yard giveaway tool which I have just figured out
[01:08:58.610 --> 01:09:01.990]  Congratulations to me. Let me see if I can get it on the screen now
[01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:09.510]  Can you guys excuse me? Just for a moment? I gotta go take my shot. Um, yes, please do john my glucometer is telling me
[01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:13.270]  Yes, please do okay so everybody
[01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:14.710]  Uh in chat
[01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:21.670]  All you have to do is just type wedding cake into chat and we will be giving away this two-pack us only guys
[01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:23.490]  girls, I
[01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:25.030]  apologize
[01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:26.310]  us
[01:09:26.310 --> 01:09:33.910]  Only we call it the mr. Magpie rule if he's listening. That's hilarious. But uh, yeah us only it's uh,
[01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:37.350]  It's just such a bitch to ship anywhere else. So
[01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:40.630]  Type wedding cake into chat. We'll leave this up here
[01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:45.270]  But we'll keep talking for a couple minutes while they get into
[01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:51.830]  The queue there, but does anybody know where ice cream cake fits into the whole
[01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:53.990]  wedding cake fiasco
[01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:56.790]  I feel like a lot of times when you do get that winner like
[01:09:57.030 --> 01:10:01.510]  Trophy wife, then you got divorce wife then you got mafia wife, then you got ex-wife
[01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:05.130]  Where does ice cream cake fit into this whole conversation?
[01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:08.150]  Sure, I can
[01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:10.150]  I can speak on it. Um
[01:10:10.230 --> 01:10:12.310]  At least from my perspective, please
[01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:16.710]  Uh, I okay. So I think at that time
[01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:21.910]  C junkie was having a hard time bringing a new variety to market that was showing off
[01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:29.030]  and I think it was like a gap like I feel like it filled a gap like the cush the the
[01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:32.970]  The the cushman's was still coming to notoriety
[01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:39.510]  Uh, his new work hadn't fully landed and I think the market just wanted something new from
[01:10:40.230 --> 01:10:42.230]  him, I I personally
[01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:45.270]  I had one uncle who would smoke it who thought it was very strong
[01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:50.390]  I'd seen some cuts i'd made rosin from a few different cuts. I've grown like five different cuts of it
[01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:53.350]  It's a gelato variety. I just okay
[01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:56.070]  We don't think it's very strong
[01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:58.710]  And
[01:10:58.710 --> 01:11:01.290]  Um, I just think it was a placeholder
[01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:05.750]  While he was rebuilding his next era of genetic lineage
[01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:08.070]  Okay
[01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:10.150]  Okay, and that makes sense, you know
[01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:15.850]  Still good still wildly popular. But as you said it might not be the cornerstone
[01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:19.430]  No, because like you could grow a lot of it
[01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:24.630]  So the cartels grew a ton of it out here like you could make a ton of clones out of it
[01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:26.710]  Like the wedding cake
[01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:32.630]  It when the wedding cake rose it wasn't easily farmed the big era hadn't come here yet
[01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:35.110]  Where these large international?
[01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:37.830]  Illegal grows were happening
[01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:41.670]  Like the wedding the ice cream cake was like this perfect plant
[01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:46.810]  That worked well and grew great resin at scale with like limited
[01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:49.350]  input
[01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:52.470]  So it was like it worked for the era too
[01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:56.790]  And it was a way different era by the time the ice cream cake showed up
[01:11:57.510 --> 01:12:00.230]  I mean people were growing 100 acres out west
[01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:05.430]  Like three years ago five years ago it got freaking crazy out here
[01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:09.750]  Um, i'm happy it's over, you know, thank goodness for the salmon
[01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:12.230]  but um
[01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:20.470]  The ice cream cake though was like it was very popular. Um in this area during that era
[01:12:22.150 --> 01:12:26.950]  I finally got to try it. This is from the melting of the heads where we're just with the
[01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:29.670]  um
[01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:33.270]  Josh there and this is from this guy turps over yields
[01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:36.470]  And I was like dude that just the nose like
[01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:41.990]  I just finally learned a lot of things that I want to put in my garden just from trying a lot of these different things
[01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:43.670]  um
[01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:45.670]  But yeah, this is ice cream cake here
[01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:52.550]  It is beautiful and it's very loud and I would say it's kind of like really funky too, right
[01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:58.230]  I like the turps of it. I think it does smell like an ice cream cake
[01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:06.110]  I guess yeah, but it has a very nice sharp note to it too like a very
[01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:08.030]  for the record
[01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:11.790]  Um third gen at brandon. He had ice cream bean
[01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:14.690]  That was very good and very interesting
[01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:19.310]  And also leo at aficionado introduced some
[01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:21.630]  ice cream
[01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:24.910]  lineage for a moment during that time queue so
[01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:28.750]  It's that ice cream cake is the one that landed
[01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:35.230]  There I I've have farmed uh, two of the three from all the other breeders as well
[01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:38.430]  Cool
[01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:42.670]  I want to give a shout out here real quick. Uh, mr. Kavar jones
[01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:47.470]  He is the one who actually kind of arranged all this for a mirror seeds
[01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:52.350]  Uh getting some of these to me to give out to you guys and he says hey guys
[01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:57.150]  I've grown that eden secret black mamba cross apple punch. She's a beast
[01:13:57.550 --> 01:14:01.790]  So that's the one of the two that's going in this first batch we got
[01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:04.270]  169
[01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:09.230]  In chat right now. We've got oh add the stream. We've got
[01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:14.670]  688 89 entries i'll give it just another minute here and then
[01:14:15.710 --> 01:14:17.870]  I'll hit draw and we'll see what happens
[01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:22.830]  But uh, yeah, no, sorry to sorry to interrupt you there. I just want to give a shout out there. Mr
[01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:25.950]  Kavar, thank you for hooking this up. Thank you for getting these out
[01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:32.030]  Uh to the community and again anybody, you know, we we like to give out free beans. That's something that
[01:14:32.730 --> 01:14:35.550]  Fcp, you know dagga.garden peter
[01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:42.270]  We always like to do and try to do as much as possible particularly veterans and patients
[01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:45.230]  But like alex saw even with your orders
[01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:51.150]  So if there are people out there with good seeds that have documented grows, this is important guys
[01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:53.550]  Uh document your grows
[01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:55.950]  Get a hold of me. We can work something out
[01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:59.070]  We might be able to do some more giveaways on seed collector shows because again
[01:14:59.070 --> 01:15:02.610]  We just want to hook up the community, but we also want to promote the community
[01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:04.670]  too
[01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:08.750]  like the last episode, you know, we had with james some of the
[01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:13.630]  Best fire might be coming from people that you've never heard of
[01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:17.470]  So we want to keep hooking up the community. So reach out to me
[01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:23.310]  Uh pride of the lion, but yeah auto flowers sour banana sherbert sounds awesome
[01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:29.150]  All right, so let's go
[01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:35.070]  And let's see. I swear i've seen 600 wedding cakes. How are there less than 100 entries?
[01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:40.990]  Oh, I don't know. Johnny blaze. This is the stream yard tool. I'm working on it
[01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:47.090]  Uh, probably because people are entering a few times. All right, so we've got 100 101
[01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:51.710]  Let me go ahead and add this to the screen and i'm, sorry
[01:15:51.710 --> 01:15:57.550]  You're just big and by yourself there alex. I was looking at a different screen. I hate it when I do that to myself
[01:15:57.790 --> 01:16:00.830]  Okay, so let me remove it. Let me add it. There we go
[01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:03.630]  Can I full screen you?
[01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:08.670]  Yes. All right. I'm gonna hop over to the screen. This is for the first drawing again. Remember
[01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:17.070]  Us only this is for two packs for mirror seeds. Let's hit this draw button and see what happens. So
[01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:19.630]  the winner will be
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.560]  Joseph anthony
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:33.280]  Congratulations, uh joseph anthony. Are you still in chat? Hit me up. Let me know
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.920]  And i'll probably just have you
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:41.440]  Instagram me, but let me write this down here before we go any further
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.080]  um
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:48.720]  Sorry to distract guys, we'll do another one here later in the show
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.120]  Uh, but joseph anthony
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.640]  Get a hold of me and i'll write these two packs down. So
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.080]  We've gone on from the cakes. What's what's next? What's
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:08.080]  What's the next soup du jour? What's something old? What's something old we can talk about has anybody run something old recently?
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:18.940]  Or have bought a pack of old stuff recently joseph anthony and chat awesome instagram me brother I have some um
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.740]  I have some really old seeds that I was uh,
[01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:29.580]  Talking about let's see. I'm i'm having issues popping them completely, but i'm getting some of them to pop. Let's see here. Um,
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:31.980]  an old homesteader, uh
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:37.900]  Tucked away in the woods back here. Um didn't talk to too many people found out somehow that I was
[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:43.260]  Into this so he went to his back little thing and whipped out his
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:48.460]  Out of his shed and found a can and he found his old seeds of his last breeding projects
[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:51.340]  They're the best cotton
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.220]  I uh
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:56.860]  Grow silver the super silver hay and I still have some of those seeds
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:00.620]  I'm going to be chasing them back this year and rebreeding them to get more of them
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:09.120]  Um that comes from like an old head around here. Uh, I I had the good fortune to have some really amazing mentors
[01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:16.060]  I'd be like a young 20 year old just loving snowboarding and surfing and chasing the farms and
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:19.900]  Some of these guys would be fully organic and
[01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:23.500]  They'd have these like 20 pound plants
[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:30.780]  Of phenomenal genetics, you know, uh, blue city diesel was one of those genetics that popped off
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:39.340]  No, the jordan of the sea was the original breeder of that
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:44.560]  Uh, and he's the one that bred the god bud and he was winning some cannabis competition
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:50.880]  He's from actually where dragonfly earth medicine is from up on the jordan of the aisle jordan of the aisle
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:56.820]  Joe, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah his dutch treat. His dutch treat was a pacific northwest classic
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.720]  Yeah, he was a huge contributor to that era
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:07.360]  You know, I I and he that was a blueberry from that was the original blueberry line
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.840]  from um
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.200]  from uh
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:15.600]  Oh my gosh, he was the eugene guy I should know I know him from this area. Um
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:21.120]  No, the no the blueberry breeder the original blueberry breeder
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.480]  Yeah, that was what made that
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:28.560]  diesel
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:32.000]  Um, and that that I've grown the original blueberry to seed
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:38.400]  I still have those original seeds my original mentor love growing on that that would be like a 12
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:43.600]  14 pound plant bright white terpenes just amazing resin
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.080]  and um
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:50.000]  so yeah, I but see again, I try to go back and
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:56.560]  Grow that stuff again and I go buy the seeds and they're not the same from the era like 10 years ago
[01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.880]  15 years ago when I started my career
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.840]  Definitely not
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:09.680]  Yeah, but i'm very grateful about still super silver haze and that was kind of a hybrid at that point it wasn't a full haze
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.480]  hybrid
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.800]  Nice
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:18.320]  Well, i'm just saying like he lost that original blueberry I think
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.560]  Yeah, he did
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:24.800]  And the velvet yes, and I actually had a conversation with the with um
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.440]  rich about that
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:30.480]  um, I think he ran that he ran those right like
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:33.840]  I got so much gear here, dude. I just I need to give it away
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.480]  I want to give some stuff away myself
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.680]  I'm excited about these I was um
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.240]  well, maybe uh
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:47.680]  Maybe we could collab with that gear on that on the project down in uh, the aravidic project i'm on
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.440]  How do you this year I got
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.520]  Yeah
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:57.120]  It's not doing any breeder or any patient any good in my box
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:59.200]  What do you have there sticky rich
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:05.760]  What we have here is um professor p creation hasn't released him yet. He's letting me test them
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.960]  It's the uh, super silver haze 98
[01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:12.340]  98 cut times the blue magoo bx2
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:18.960]  I'm super excited about these they they're all looking pretty pretty cool. Um,
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:22.560]  I was also lucky enough to he let me uh run his
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:25.920]  lemon lolly
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:33.040]  Lemon lollipops, uh, but right before he released it as a tester thing. I ran them outdoors. It came out really nice
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:34.720]  um
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:39.920]  So i'm really been uh standing by his work lately as some pretty solid stuff
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  I'd really love to get into more of the super silver. Can you guys hear sticky rich?
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.120]  Yep
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:52.080]  Yep, are you not? Yeah, I can hear rich. I'm really excited to dive more into
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:56.080]  I'm really excited to dive more into uh
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:04.480]  The super silver haze work. He's done the pineapple, uh fields work. He's done and some other work because uh
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.760]  Um, it's been fantastic i've since taken some of his
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.480]  uh, the lemon lollipops
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.960]  Males that I found and I hunted through them
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:22.960]  I found a nice one and I used that to do some crosses that i'm pretty excited about that are currently being tested out. Um,
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:27.840]  One of them being the uh crossed it to the lemon snow cone
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:35.360]  Which is a kind of a collaborative effort between me and another local, uh here part of that super tight circle
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:40.240]  Um lemon snow cone is a cross between lemon tree and uh, super lemon haze
[01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:44.800]  And it really produced some incredible resin outside here in our short season
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:48.960]  Uh as tough as it can be in the northeast and produced well
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:53.280]  I'm trying to add a little bit of that blue magoo to that super
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:57.200]  Lemon haze and the blue magoo is like this really nice subtle
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:03.280]  Blueberry lemon almost a little bit of lavender hint of in there. It's really nice. So
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.920]  Combined both
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.920]  Back in the day too
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.920]  Yeah solid so
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:20.240]  From like 10 plus years ago, it was uh, yeah, we grew a lot of the magoo back in the day
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.080]  Yeah
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.980]  Again, shout out professor p dynasty genetics
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:30.240]  Yeah that that one in blue city diesel I see in the uh, oregon market a lot
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:34.080]  Yeah
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:37.200]  Eugene and the blueberry does well in the rain
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:41.520]  So I imagine that that's good breeding genetics for you up in the northeast as well
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.200]  The resin like it doesn't if you read it, right?
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.720]  It's the resin like has so well
[01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:54.960]  It's so fine that like it keeps the mold out of it. It's like it has a little air and it
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:57.760]  Yeah, it grows well
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:59.520]  outdoors
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:03.780]  Now with two names like that it better have a lemon profile
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.080]  Does it have a lemon profile?
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.360]  Definitely
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:20.080]  Lemon snow cone has this really creamy. Um, creamy lemon not a sweet like a one note lemon. Um,
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.560]  Like kind of the lemon tree seems to be like a really just
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:30.160]  Whereas the lemon snow cone is like a creamy subtle kind of lemon thing
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:38.160]  But the lemon lollipops was a really nice lemon blueberry kind of thing blueberry lemonade kind of flavor so
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.620]  um, you can definitely
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:41.920]  expect
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:42.880]  some
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:49.920]  Leaners towards the blueberry-ish, uh, like a subtle blueberry. It's not like in your face super loud blueberry, but it's that subtle
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.720]  slightly sweet blueberry
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:59.360]  Uh, and you can find but most of them will be in your lemon, uh, various lemon profiles of you know
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.360]  either loud

[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.840]  The east coast snowblower, that's the cross coast snowblower. Oh, okay

[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:01.600]  He used that cut with his white truffle. You guys had mentioned white truffle earlier. So
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.400]  These are for me to butter

[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:30.400]  So we crossed that with his white truffle
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:35.440]  And uh, i'm gonna test some of that and uh, he also sent me uh,
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:39.920]  Odo s1 little five pack of his odo. So
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:42.540]  boom fire
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:46.640]  That's my my chance to show something so far i've got more over here
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:49.200]  But I had to get in on the game just a little bit
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.440]  And what do you got down there a very
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:58.000]  There you go dipping sticks that's coming from him. Yeah, I used
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:03.360]  Cotton I cost it to that pinkleberry just to see what's gonna come out of it
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.600]  Nice, I haven't I haven't run those yet. So I still gotta see what's
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:14.480]  Garlic hot times glazed cherry. That sounds good. Tell me about that
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.960]  Green sauce nice
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.800]  My friend reads with it at stay fly
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:26.880]  I am new to garlic hot guys, please fill me in. What am I missing? How does it grow? What does it smell?
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:31.360]  What does it taste like? I honestly have not had that or heard it
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:34.300]  africa
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:40.640]  Coming in just the hashers, okay, then it make cake. It's good
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.640]  Hash
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:50.720]  Or is this like a healthy strong full season plant a lot of bigger and um, it had uh,
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:57.520]  The smoke was like really on the gelato side, you know, it was like very earthy
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:01.440]  But it was like stony and relaxing but just shout out to stay fly
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:07.440]  uh another person in the permaculture scene that's really representing well and
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:12.880]  You know, and yeah the farmer does a lot of work always so they did a really good job with it
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.940]  But he's they're breeding it into their genetics
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:24.000]  Nice mud swat anything with the word garlic in it is going to be fire. I tend to agree that is uh,
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.360]  A profile that I do not shy away from
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:29.600]  so
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.600]  I uh
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:34.480]  From green source gardens
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:41.360]  Um, so nick at green source gardens was where I originally got those from and I just brought them another
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:49.600]  Another generation further. I opened up the the pack they gave me and I just created more of a population to hunt through
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.520]  and that's
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:54.560]  What john has there? I just um, you know
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:58.000]  Anytime I get a pack anytime I get a pack
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:00.160]  That's
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.560]  Anytime I get a pack of 10 seeds, you know
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:10.080]  I like to just kind of make a little bit more so that we have a few to play with. Um
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.040]  Do you usually hold a couple back?
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.840]  This is something that dave our co-host and myself and a lot of guests do it's like if it's a 10 pack
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.400]  We always hold two back. How about you?
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:24.660]  I'm, I've always been more of a selector than a collector
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.360]  I'm popping them
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.680]  Nothing wrong with that
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:36.240]  Like that, yep and cannabis fine you're primarily outdoor I buy I buy
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:45.200]  Yeah sun-grown greenhouse and outdoor totally exclusive so so you you're not worried about
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:50.780]  About what
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:54.060]  Oh, I say you're not necessarily worried about room in the tent then
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:58.300]  Room in the tent you can pop all 10. You don't have to hold two back
[01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:01.180]  So you don't have to hold two back
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:06.300]  Oh, yeah, I buy I've always bought like a hundred seed at a time generally
[01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:15.100]  And then I but I hold like half back because the seeds become more valuable and I like to hold on to them as currency
[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:19.180]  So I have yeah, I have a I have a
[01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:27.980]  Pretty good chest of seeds. Um, and I can't help myself. I keep buying more like I just like I said, I just bought it
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:31.980]  Let me think
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.860]  Intervention on John guys
[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:02.380]  Yeah, I can help this year let's go
[01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:08.140]  No, I had that
[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:10.780]  He was nice enough to have us to his farm. I was like, you know
[01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:14.540]  I got a lot of stuff here. It just needs to get sorted because like
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:18.380]  It's still you know only viable for a certain amount of time
[01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:22.620]  I mean, of course they find seeds in egyptian tombs and they sprout them but like
[01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:25.580]  I don't you know
[01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:28.460]  What's the use of collecting them if they're not going to be you know?
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:31.100]  found and now we have so many of these, um
[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:36.380]  modern techniques of you know preserving them and I know his friend is doing that I
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:43.020]  Uh, you know, i'm almost thinking about my 818 that i've been running for the last nine years. I need to preserve it somehow
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:45.660]  um, that's a whole nother thing like
[01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:48.620]  I don't necessarily create seed but now I see
[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:51.260]  the real importance in it
[01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:55.980]  But like I was saying it's it's in a box. It's not I know there's some gems to be found
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:32:03.180]  It is a problem, right it's like i'm trying to make up for all those baseball cards on all my coin collection that I sold
[01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:05.180]  When I needed money
[01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.500]  Yeah, yeah
[01:32:08.060 --> 01:32:10.060]  But it's not currently using it
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:15.340]  Let's go poppy lung stockings. Yeah, bro
[01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:21.020]  This is alex hardy's stuff, uh, I have a lot
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:27.820]  A few more of his packs that I want to get into too, but these two, uh are specific ones that i'm pretty excited about
[01:32:28.380 --> 01:32:30.380]  Top one's the pine tar skunk
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:32.700]  To his breath of purple
[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:36.780]  Um, and the bottom one he calls thc the hardcore
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:44.620]  Um, so I think the story with that and if i'm butchering it guys in chat, please save me here
[01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:48.220]  But he like stress test beat the shit out of that one
[01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:52.060]  That was grown out of like rocks on the side of a mountain I think like
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.840]  consecutively season after season
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:57.020]  He selected them like
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:33:00.940]  Out of rocks or very poor growing medium
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:04.060]  um
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:06.860]  And yeah, so he gave me those as like some stuff to
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:10.940]  Check out once many moons ago and i've only gotten into some of them
[01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:15.740]  But I think there's like 30 or 40 other ones in there to look for for some super outdoor
[01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:21.020]  Very much beat up gear so that's going to be exciting stuff, too. That's awesome. And I know
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:24.380]  Dude, I know
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:28.700]  Alex does a lot of dry farming and so yeah, he really does make sure that things
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:33.900]  Work in a lot of different circumstances that pine tar kush though. I know that's pine tar skunk
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:39.580]  Is the last time that I was like uncomfortably high up in canada, man
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.740]  Like I will not forget that shot
[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:46.460]  Sticky rich humble seed. So let's let's just recap too because i'm just gonna shameless plug here
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:51.020]  Pretty much a lot of these people were just talking about humble included
[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:55.100]  Uh, you can find on the daggett.garden website guys, so
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:34:01.820]  Definitely check it out the daggett.garden. But which which one was that sticky richie because i'm a big fan of humble
[01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:04.780]  I don't have any other gear that i'm not a big fan of
[01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:07.420]  But i'm a big fan of humble
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:10.140]  Because i'm a big fan of humble
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:13.100]  Uh, I don't have any other gear myself, but i'm a big fan
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:17.260]  I just saw somebody in the chat post that they bought potty mouth today
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:22.060]  And it was just one of the ones that I had out on the possible. Um
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:26.780]  Pop list because i've heard some good things about it. It's a cross of uh,
[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:35.740]  um humble pound cake and mountain top mint, um, it's supposed to be pretty you know insane on the terpenes and such
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:42.380]  Now what what's what sort of information do they give on the back of their packaging like are they like a duke diamond?
[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:47.580]  Who's just got you know, how many days how many profiles? What are you going to expect again?
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:50.780]  Shout out dominion seed co I was wearing your t-shirt earlier
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:57.660]  But I couldn't wear it on the show again because that's actually the one t-shirt that i've repeated. I wore it the week before
[01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:01.980]  Or the show before duke came on because he had just put him out
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:06.060]  I got him and you know, my thing is the fresh t-shirts every episode
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:09.740]  Uh, but then he came on the next episode and you know what?
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:13.180]  I had to be the guy who wore the shirt of the band he was going to see
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:16.380]  So I wore it but uh, yeah
[01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:20.860]  No, a long way of saying duke has some of the best information on the back of his packaging
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:26.700]  Humboldt seed co they've got great packaging. What does the back look like on there? What does it tell you?
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:31.500]  It's got some great packaging on there for sure. It's very flashy
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:33.420]  um
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:36.940]  It tells you let's see effects hybrid, uh
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.800]  hybrid
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:44.880]  Indica sativa percentages average thc 24 to 30 percent
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:50.380]  Dazzling trichrome brax and then it starts to get into this write-up. That is
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:55.820]  I don't know if I want to go into the whole thing, but it's by the time you're done. You pretty much can't
[01:35:56.540 --> 01:35:58.540]  Help but buy the pack. That's what happened to me
[01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:03.500]  And I heard now that they just came out with scratch and sniff did you hear about that
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:12.940]  The the emerald are gonna have actual um smell of that particular strain on the back
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:22.380]  I haven't witnessed that yet personally, but um as far as humboldt goes i've grown. Um, a handful of their
[01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:24.620]  Uh
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:32.460]  Strains over the years the last one the last couple were uh, blueberry muffin, uh and all gas og
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.140]  um
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:35.500]  and uh
[01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.980]  Now this one will be the next potty mouth
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:39.420]  Let's see
[01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:45.020]  Mainswood's grow drew the jelly rancher out heard a lot of people seen a lot of people grow that one out love it
[01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:48.060]  The blueberry muffin is one that I heard that I wanted to try
[01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:50.140]  uh, because
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:58.300]  I got 45 50 day finish on that one. It's like get out of here. You're you no way shows me the pictures i'm like
[01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:03.020]  Okay, holy sh you know, holy shit, man
[01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:07.180]  Uh, but the flavors on a lot of those with the humboldt man
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:10.460]  That's probably why the scratches sniff is gonna work. They have
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:18.400]  very defined flavor profiles in each of their cultivars, which is awesome because they're able to get that kind of consistency
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:20.800]  but uh
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:26.080]  You know like skunk isn't you know skunk cat piss things that nobody can agree on
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.880]  That's not in their line, but we all know what like cantaloupe smells like blueberries
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:35.520]  So I see the scratch and sniff working with them and that's just a huge
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:38.160]  uh
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:42.640]  Awesome factor selling point warm fuzzy all of the above
[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:48.080]  So that's how about uh you chef or john do you have you guys grown out any of the uh
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:51.600]  Humboldt seed company stuff before or have your eye on any of it?
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:56.080]  I've got to try the blueberry muffin a couple of different
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:00.080]  Ruett but but I haven't grown any you know
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:08.420]  I haven't grown the blueberry muffin yet either but that's talk of the town and the northeast over here
[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:11.220]  That's talk of the town and the northeast over here
[01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:15.860]  It's got a quick finish time and it seems to be what a lot of people in maine are growing to
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:18.260]  outside
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:19.540]  anyway
[01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:23.460]  Outside for me. It was very fast very loud very uniform
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:29.140]  They've done the work if you're looking for you know, a bunch of plants from seed that are going to look exactly the same
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:33.060]  uh, they definitely fit that mold for me it just
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:40.020]  The faster plants it still holds true that the quality quality quality comes with a little more time
[01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:45.700]  I I love the smell and the turps, but the bud and the whole experience and the effects
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:47.860]  uh
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:49.860]  I don't know. It's not as
[01:38:50.180 --> 01:38:56.420]  Connoisseur quality as I love. Um, it's it's a one note kind of thing. It's it's great
[01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:59.860]  Don't get me wrong and I understand why people love it because when you open that jar
[01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:05.780]  It literally smells like blueberry muffins. So it's it's it's really cool and it's experience just that
[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:12.500]  But the fake blueberry muffins not like a home-cooked blueberry muffins, but like the hostess blueberry muffin with the yeah
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:15.060]  gas station muffins, baby
[01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:18.340]  Yeah
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:24.260]  I would that is one that's on my list. So I'm gonna grow that one
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:27.940]  I would that is one that's on my list. So I'm gonna grow that one
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:36.580]  Another another awesome east coasters rolling up in saying what's up? Everybody? Peace to mr. Blue green tank. What's up?
[01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:50.740]  Back to the super silver haze i'm gonna try to pop these two because i'm testing those super silver haze crosses from professor p
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:52.900]  I've just found an old uh
[01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:55.300]  Bodie pack that I had
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:40:00.580]  Or no, maybe I didn't I don't know but it's a super silver haze times our hash plant
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:03.460]  You know the 88g13 hash plants
[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:07.460]  That's the amazing motion
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:12.980]  Yeah, i've run the mimosa cut from him time across with that and it was awesome
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:15.940]  I've run a bunch of things crossed with you know that he's crossed with it
[01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:19.140]  I love the way it you know, um
[01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:22.820]  It allows whatever he crosses it to come out
[01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:28.660]  Yet still kind of he's able to make it in seed form for us, you know, so we can kind of open up
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:30.340]  things that
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:33.540]  flavors new things into these seeds, so I don't know i'm just
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:39.300]  Now that i've been on that super trying to get back into that super silver haze kind of stuff
[01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:44.980]  I just thought i'd pop up a couple of these too. I love to smoke it don't want to grow it again
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:50.180]  I just I was like 45 50 days. Hell. Yeah, you're like 14 weaker
[01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:57.060]  I love smoking my hazes, but I just i'm limited with my space and i'm also indoors
[01:40:57.380 --> 01:41:04.680]  If I was outdoor or if I had like a large greenhouse, I would totally grow some but I have to be selective
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:11.780]  When I hear john digging over there, what do you yeah, this is this is all bodie seeds right here, dude
[01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:13.700]  Break it out
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:15.700]  He's he's his show favorite. What'd you get?
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:20.420]  Kevin, jordy was the one that said grow that hollyweed. So I have another pack of hollyweed here
[01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:26.180]  I have a great pheno that i've been saving now for the past four years or five years, but um
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:33.300]  In here like he was saying that adhe13 hash plan is a stud because like I want to get into this
[01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:38.340]  Well, here's this is the hollyweed. This is the one that kevin jordy said was like to grow back in
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:40.020]  2018
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:44.180]  Okay, so that's about four or four or five years old that you when you pick that one up
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:47.620]  um, I picked this one up in
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:51.040]  2019 I believe okay
[01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:52.820]  Okay. Yeah
[01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:57.300]  I've had it since or it was 2017. Maybe maybe i'm confusing but
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:01.640]  That adhe13 hash plant I have here also crossed to angelica
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:07.240]  Which is uh, and I have the cocoon which is the lumpa headband to the wookie15
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:12.180]  I did I do have a turpinado pheno that I saved and actually, uh,
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:15.800]  Dan rebel grown said that that was the second most interesting
[01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:19.540]  Flavor that I had in the jars at that time hash cuddler
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:22.500]  But this is angelica
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:28.340]  To the um hells og to the adhe13 hash plant. I have like three different
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:30.900]  Packs in here that are all to that
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:32.900]  that beautiful hash plant
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:34.980]  Wow, is that hollyweed?
[01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:37.460]  You know i'm gonna
[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:42.980]  I'm gonna jump down i'm gonna get in on some of this. It's not bode. I don't have any bode gear. Damn me
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:46.280]  Um, but this is county line genetics
[01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:47.700]  uh, mr
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:53.780]  Rusty nails sent me some of because we're on the topic the county line hash plant
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:59.140]  So it's the 86 hash plant silver thiol sulfate reversed a couple seeds in here
[01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:03.140]  i'm stoked about that one since we're on the subjects of hash plant, but
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:05.620]  I'm gonna turn it back to you guys
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:12.740]  That's awesome, uh, oh you got the dickie rich just came sat down with a box
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:18.100]  What did you have there chef alex that was more uh mean gene
[01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:21.700]  Yeah, this is some of this
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:25.220]  That he's got he pulled up these out. These were smaller plants
[01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:29.380]  You showed a while back, but this is the grape lime soda skunk back crossed
[01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:31.940]  Nice yeah
[01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:34.740]  I'm excited for that too
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:39.780]  It's not a problem the only problem is I need a bigger box
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:44.980]  Welcome back
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:51.780]  Or a bigger room, yes, there you go. That's the right attitude that's happening
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:54.340]  Happening
[01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:56.260]  You know, that's right
[01:43:56.260 --> 01:44:02.740]  When ritchie was touching on the uh, the longer flowering varieties and the potency and you know earlier in the beginning
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:06.980]  Uh, we were talking the amsterdam genetics, you know, and those kind of being watered down
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:13.700]  they kind of offered a feminized version a regular version an auto flowering version of pretty much everything and I think that's
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:18.500]  Crisscross applesauce all over the place and that helped it get a bad rep too
[01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:23.080]  But it also in turn made those shorter flowering and less resinous varieties
[01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:30.180]  Gave a lot of that like bad name, but we are moving in a better direction selecting for resin and terpenes and moving those
[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:32.660]  and hybridizing the photo people
[01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.700]  Back the direction it needs to go which is good
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:38.580]  but uh, he came back on right as he was
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:43.220]  Finishing talking about that. So I figured i'd plug those two back together, too
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:47.140]  Don't forget the autos, but no, they're not as good
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:50.500]  As the
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:52.500]  uh
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:54.500]  Catching up man. They're definitely
[01:44:55.060 --> 01:45:02.260]  Dude, they're like the they're like lighting technology and leds, you know hps ruled for a long time and they were better
[01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:04.900]  But leds slowly caught up, man
[01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:07.940]  So we'll see
[01:45:08.980 --> 01:45:10.980]  Yeah, for sure
[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:17.380]  Three or four harvests you just entered you just interviewed wolf seagull. He might not agree with what you just said there chad
[01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:22.180]  Would agree with what I just said there. I don't I don't I don't agree
[01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:25.880]  There we go. Sun grow sun groans
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:28.660]  uh
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:32.260]  That's hard to argue man
[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:40.660]  Give it up. Let's hear it brother. I can't just move move your weather up here to the coast for me, please
[01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:44.100]  Like i'm on the rainy side, but i'll be
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:47.060]  I'll be farming permaculture
[01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:52.420]  Area data plants out east so we can at least hang out on the conversation out there
[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:55.240]  And i'll love to talk to you guys about the genetics
[01:45:56.740 --> 01:46:02.600]  And john, I would love to grow some of those seeds man, maybe we could do a collaboration down there
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:07.940]  That's so awesome
[01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:13.940]  Bad ass, uh, let's see here. What else do I have?
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:15.620]  of
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:19.060]  Oh, you beat me too at sticky richie, which what you got up there?
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:24.180]  Oh, let's put that up on the big board. We got to give a shout out to this brother right here
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:28.260]  High striker farm. He's in uh, southern, maine named ryan
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:32.920]  Farmer ryan. Okay. Does he have a cultivar?
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:36.820]  Of choice or does he have a wide menu that he's worked?
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.440]  No
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:50.080]  Period feminized seeds that he has that are photos off of his, uh, cherry gmo
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:55.760]  I believe that he's released but he also has a full line of autos too that he's done for uh, maine
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:58.640]  And I think it's a blue micro version
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:00.480]  Is that what you have there?
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:04.960]  Did he share a room within college and he picked out a pheno of something you he was telling us?
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:07.440]  Just to give him credit for that I guess
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:12.000]  We'll definitely plug him there for that because that's a well known so uh
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:15.680]  Ryan is known for the great pie cut, uh that is
[01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:20.180]  Known in the hash world. He went to college. He was roommates with canerado
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:24.560]  Um, and he got the seeds from him found the cut and got it back to him
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:31.040]  Um, and that's what finest I think finest cannabis has the great pie cut that's from what he found
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:33.680]  so like full circle this whole
[01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:36.720]  conversation coast to coast east coast west coast
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.360]  Yeah, man
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:41.360]  Tight-knit group this community
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:46.400]  Cherry streusel. He made some beautiful ross in this cherry streusel and I think he's got a
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:50.560]  Streusel line with a lot of stuff. He's crossed to this cherry streusel
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:56.320]  That's what it was the cherry streusel, uh rich go ahead and uh, sorry. I stopped you man
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:02.160]  I got excited when I saw the ponies pack, uh go on and talk go ahead and uh, talk about what you got there
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:04.560]  that gold
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:08.480]  Uh-oh now we can't hear you are you muted?
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:16.480]  Is it uh, let's see. Did I meet no looks like you're unmuted on this end you were frozen a second to go
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:24.400]  Um, I know he is up in the new england area where they're getting a lot of snow and a lot of cold
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:29.600]  Uh, it's windy as crap man. It's cold and windy too, and we don't hear you
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:33.280]  You might leave and come back sticky rich, uh that might you know
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:37.840]  Reset the system. So maybe give that a shot just kind of leave and then come back in
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:40.320]  We'll let you back in um
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:46.000]  So, yeah, sometimes joshua, what are you smoking on what are you smoking on I want to know
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:56.640]  Yeah, yeah, well, um I had to represent myself today, um smoking on some of my genetics, uh,
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:02.640]  13 ghosts was the uh female and the male was from uh
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:05.120]  Oh
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:12.560]  Jungle boys, they had a wedding cake on a skittles and it's a it's a turpey, you know stony
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:15.680]  Joint i've been calling it wild rose
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:22.400]  And I have the stud seeds and female to it. I'll be working it into the line this year
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:29.840]  That's cool, so so if you were going to uh, if I came and visited your farm
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:36.400]  What what are the top three ones that you're gonna recommend to me of that you've grown that you've put together
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:39.120]  Uh, what what would you put forward?
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:49.860]  Okay, well this this one I really like this wild rose it makes rosin it's a good variety
[01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:53.460]  um, another one is uh
[01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:56.660]  The um
[01:49:56.660 --> 01:50:01.620]  Well the 13 ghosts we've already gone over that another one's the doc z by brandon third gen
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:04.180]  um
[01:50:04.180 --> 01:50:06.580]  I always liked it was my favorite high
[01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:14.500]  and I um, but it never had the brightest resin, but it's the resin it's the rosin that i've always liked to smoke and
[01:50:14.660 --> 01:50:17.540]  This year at one second at the organs growers cup
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:19.860]  and uh
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:26.820]  So it's just it is about terrapins. It is about high and an educated group of old school west coast judges
[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:34.260]  Are really able to seek that fine line of that quality and I I did not expect that variety to win
[01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:37.700]  I'm, so used to the buyer's market the visual market
[01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:42.820]  um, we can yeah sometimes get distracted from what that perfect
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:45.380]  Joint actually is. Uh
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:51.780]  I love the doc z from third gen from brandon seeds. Uh another variety. I'll
[01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:59.060]  Uh, love to shout out to stay fly at sherb he has a sherbet and stay fly is a
[01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:04.900]  A friend of mine and a really uh awesome contributor to the cannabis community as well
[01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:09.460]  Totally regenerative permaculture sun-grown cat. Um in this area
[01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:14.340]  So yeah, it's uh, those are the cultivars that i'm most uh
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:17.620]  Excited about and smoking on the most this year
[01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:19.540]  Nice
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:21.540]  Sounds good. Thank you for sharing there
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:24.660]  I show up with a lot of
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:28.020]  Did you say something about the sherb josh?
[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:30.820]  Yeah, the sure bait is sure breath
[01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:33.540]  on the uh skunk bait
[01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:38.340]  And it's uh, it smells like peanuts like salted nuts
[01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:44.900]  It's a really unique like terpene, but the thing is with this living soil i'm always like, oh, it doesn't have that much turf
[01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:49.940]  So it doesn't smell that strong and then I smoke a joint of it and it's like dripping out of the joint
[01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:53.620]  And it's like all of a sudden the earth has got a flavor
[01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:56.340]  sweet
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:03.460]  Welcome back sticky richie. Can we hear you? I hope so everybody hear me now
[01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:11.380]  Yeah, I had to get out of like I was in a temporary hot spot because the internet went down
[01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:14.340]  But now I went back to the internet and the internet works better
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:21.940]  Okay, so you you were about to tell us about the pack from your buddy that you were holding up there we were gonna get
[01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:29.540]  Back. I had this from high striker farm and this was a black and blue cream. It was called. It's an auto flower
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:31.300]  um
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:33.700]  black cream times blue microwares f3
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:36.500]  um, so it's um
[01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:43.560]  I grew it last year as part of uh, like I said right next to chef's autos. Both of them are pretty fantastic
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:48.440]  So, um shout out to him. I'll be definitely uh,
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:54.760]  Him back up for this season this guy right there right there. He's not paying attention that guy
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:00.040]  High striker
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  Yeah, uh speaking of autos, um, I got some from jason
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:17.480]  On his farm. He's uh, not only doing full term, but he's working on some early finishing and auto work
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:24.040]  He's got the uh straw nana auto speaking of straw nana. I just took the it's a beautiful
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:27.560]  Dna
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:31.560]  That was the other
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:37.880]  But that's worked into the auto format and then it also got hit too I believe the early line
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.600]  as well as um
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:47.640]  Something I think mr. Hoda herb gave me a happy accident of with the doctor who
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:52.040]  uh crossed but here's an early line to
[01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.840]  the doctor who lemon g
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:57.160]  another uh project with jason's that
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:53:59.320]  is uh
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:00.760]  very much
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:02.760]  early project
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:07.660]  What was the name of that one that he had that was the freesland mob
[01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:12.220]  To some oh that's what main dodo main dope
[01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:15.100]  perps main main doperps
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:17.820]  But he did um csis
[01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:22.380]  No perps, but he selected for and acclimated it. Um
[01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:27.260]  I think one or two seasons and he called it main doperps, which is awesome
[01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:31.760]  But this is a specific cross that he did off of a sherb selection
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:34.140]  um
[01:54:34.140 --> 01:54:40.780]  Not the sunshet sure but the sherb which as far as I understand is the mother of the skittles
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:43.500]  um, and I think
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:47.100]  Uh that the terps on it are
[01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:53.260]  Like skittles turned down lighter. Um as far as i've heard in cases diet skittles
[01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:57.980]  Sugar-free skittles. Yeah
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:05.020]  Uh, maybe uh cannabis vine has a better description of skittles light, uh than I can give right now
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:12.540]  Yeah, yeah the shirt that came from the same tray
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:20.220]  It's hitting the uh hit with the freesland mop and the nose that I smelled on those flowers was just
[01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:22.460]  Yeah
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:27.820]  He mixed in some royal seven with that as well on different thoughts
[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:33.500]  But yeah, those terps were just loud astringent like
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:36.940]  Yeah made me drool
[01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:41.820]  Dude, I I didn't know about sherb. I guess this is um, joshua's neighbor
[01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:44.540]  uh whale oil
[01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:49.180]  Okay, this is the sherb here and yeah, he's new to the area
[01:55:50.140 --> 01:55:55.260]  Yeah, and so that that was really delicious so I got to finally try the sherb
[01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:59.020]  Yeah the tk2
[01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:03.820]  Yeah, yeah and dude it's funny because we were both talking about the triangle cush and the sherb
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:06.300]  What did my nose pick out our nose nose?
[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:10.460]  Uh, you know, so that that's the that's that's the triangle cush
[01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:13.580]  So I grabbed out of the two out of the things he was offering
[01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:17.660]  Those were the two things that my nose picked out the sherb and um, well
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:20.060]  I would just grab those ones
[01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:27.020]  Visually on instinct on name, but then they're amazing and he's been extracting that sherbert for a while. He's really good at it
[01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:29.340]  He knows how to extract it. Well
[01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:30.860]  it's uh
[01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:34.860]  Yeah, he said that they came from the same tray the sherbert of skittles
[01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:37.900]  Okay, that's what it is
[01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:45.280]  So, sorry, I mean there's always been a shroud around it i've talked to some people pretty close to the conversation
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:51.440]  But it was just like I think that the skittles was so valuable when it first released
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:55.680]  They did everything in their power to protect it to create its lineage
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:02.720]  Yeah, i'm glad you could fill that up because I didn't want to misrepresent anything but thank you because
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:09.920]  Oh, i'm sorry to go out to this but that's what I thought my my forbidden can um
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:13.460]  Forbidden candy from leo from aficionado
[01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:20.500]  It but to like good name royal f9 or f11 that's the the box that I bought
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:25.060]  Poor maria thought I would brought home a ring for her. She's
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:31.460]  I don't want to say that too loud, but like that way that was packaged and I was like look look honey
[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:38.200]  Oh god, I can see that one backfiring. That's a meme waiting to happen somebody opening their seed box
[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:50.580]  But seriously that that that I showed it earlier but that that's what I thought that was forbidden candy was
[01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:56.500]  Leo's, uh version of that to a royal's, uh, kush's nine or eleven or something
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:05.860]  Tantalizing do you know josh that forbidden can the forbidden candy?
[01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:11.780]  No, um
[01:58:12.580 --> 01:58:20.500]  I mean, I know that he bred with the forbidden fruit. I had that on a pineapple lineage, uh a
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:29.300]  Pineapple sorbet that was really good that he had years ago. Um, and
[01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:36.660]  I can also think of a sangria variety that he bred that was very orange
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:39.860]  But I don't think that those are either of those so no well
[01:58:40.820 --> 01:58:42.820]  The this is the forbidden candy
[01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:49.800]  And it says it's grape ape times grapefruit times unknown times rile. What is the genetics?
[01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:55.540]  Grape ape grapefruit times unknown. Isn't that skittles?
[01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:07.260]  Grape ape times grapefruit i'm losing
[01:59:08.540 --> 01:59:13.580]  Wasn't that wasn't that? I've never i've never heard a clear answer on it to be honest
[01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:17.820]  I've heard people other than third gen saying it was theirs
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:23.580]  No, no, no, I know that but I was wondering what this was because I thought that's what this this was skittles
[01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:25.820]  Basically just crossed to this royal nine
[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:28.140]  um
[01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:30.640]  You know rest maybe uh, mandelbrot's f9
[01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:40.460]  Well, that's another thing too though, it's like so anyway, i'm sorry I didn't mean to get sidetracked but I thought oh shit
[01:59:40.460 --> 01:59:42.460]  Maybe he'll know because right
[01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:45.660]  No name for it forbidden candy
[01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:50.620]  It's not forbidden fruit. It's forbidden candy because when he gave me the vanilla berry pie
[01:59:51.020 --> 01:59:53.580]  I thought it said vanilla cherry pie because of the way that
[01:59:54.220 --> 02:00:01.420]  That maker's mark kind of dripping was over the so he's like no. No, it's not very I mean, it's not cherry. It's berry pie
[02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:04.860]  Yeah, and what was great babe great paper?
[02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:11.340]  Purple at the same cross. I think if you look back at it or what was there was something like that in the uh,
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:13.100]  story
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:15.160]  apothecary genetics and
[02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:18.140]  Similar cross or similar parentage
[02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:22.700]  Granddaddy purple was better. They said
[02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:28.460]  It's the magnum opus i'm thinking maybe I don't know. That's what everybody says still
[02:00:30.940 --> 02:00:35.020]  Granddaddy purple like knocked me out. I remember the first time I smoked it
[02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:39.900]  My friends and I were moving some plants up the mountain and one of them just like passed out
[02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:43.760]  We couldn't even get him to wake up and I was like, wow, what an interesting variety
[02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:49.980]  you always notice those heavy varieties those heavy hitters when they first show up because some people just like
[02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:57.900]  They get knocked over, you know, and that variety has always had that legacy. We really like the jaeger in our area, too
[02:00:57.980 --> 02:00:59.580]  It's a pure kush
[02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:00.920]  purple kush
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:06.140]  Hindu kush land race lineage that has a really strong anise smell
[02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:09.260]  it's one of the strongest weeds i've ever smoked and
[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:17.420]  It's like only 17 percent. So there's so much more to the terpenes into the cannabinoids into the way that they all like
[02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:23.500]  Work and go through the system, you know, you just can't always like measure these things. Um
[02:01:24.220 --> 02:01:26.220]  You know scientifically
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:31.500]  Right. Well, I mean to that point too like the the forbidden fruit we were just talking about
[02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:37.520]  Forbidden fruit came into the shop when I was doing retail and their testing was it was like 15.4
[02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:44.020]  Nobody would even look at it knowing that percentage but it was the frostiest
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:50.240]  Freaking flower we had in the display cases and I just told everybody i'm like look
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:53.680]  Don't tell them the thc just take out the bag
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:02:00.560]  Let them look at just let them look at it. Everybody who showed it to boom took it didn't even flip it over
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:02.880]  they just took it so
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:08.160]  You're right they didn't come back and complain either because this was one of those stores where people love to tell you all about their
[02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:09.600]  $10 dabs
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:10.480]  um
[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:15.920]  But yeah, so it hit man it hit it didn't test high but it hit so add that magic sauce to it
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:17.680]  and that's like
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:20.400]  And that's all terpenes, right the forbidden fruit
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:26.720]  Yeah, oh yeah, it was it was like it's like you can smell it
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:33.680]  From across the room like no matter how big the room is right like you can smell the terpenes through the smoke
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:37.360]  If you if you got a bag in your pocket
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:40.640]  If you came through in this smoke
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:49.840]  Yeah, yeah, I always call that party weed, you know, it's not like the heavy weed i'm trying to smoke myself alone
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:54.080]  But it's a type of weed i'm trying to pass around a group of people, you know
[02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:59.200]  Everybody enjoys the smell and you can it lingers in the room. Yeah. Yeah
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:03.360]  Yes. Yeah. No, I could tell that that kool-aid man is one of those as well
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:08.160]  I could tell whenever my wife i'm like you you were just smoking kool-aid man, weren't you? She's like, yeah
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:17.120]  To me that's one of the signs of quality herb, you know, is it leave that nice delicious smell in the air behind it?
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:19.840]  You know, that's one of those characteristics. I love to look for
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:27.120]  Um, not all I mean some of my favorite weed doesn't do it don't get me wrong but like it's so awesome when
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:34.400]  You come back to the room later on or to an area and it's it's just has that really beautiful almost like
[02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:37.440]  Incense or sweet smell in the room, you know
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:40.080]  I love it
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:45.200]  Well, you know, it's funny you said that because that's how I met joshua because he said
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:50.400]  I had I followed your scent of your weed to where where me and alex were
[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:54.780]  Remember josh
[02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:04.320]  Right and every time we hang out now, I always want to smell those uh terpenes as well
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:10.560]  It's piercing to the it's piercing to the nostril and yeah
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:15.840]  That I and I think you're gonna find something similar to that right, you know
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:21.300]  For sure, yeah, i'm really really excited
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:27.140]  It's lip smacking almost it makes me feel like i'm a dog with jowls
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:32.880]  Turner and hooch no, uh real quick
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:39.520]  I want to break in here. Uh, I want to do some more more giveaways. We got another two packs of mirror seeds
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:45.040]  Uh to give away here tonight. Uh, we're at a little over the two hour mark of the show
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:48.160]  Usually we stop but with these guys we go all night

[02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:04.080]  This this I got going when I popped those seeds from from jimmy from myers creek
[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:09.520]  These this is it's not labeled because I got this through uh, joshua's regenerative seed
[02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.120]  um
[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:13.120]  uh, but this is the um
[02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:16.060]  banana dog guava punch
[02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:18.560]  This is supposed to be a washer
[02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:21.040]  um
[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:23.600]  I only started a few of them because you know
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:28.800]  I have limited space because I did eight of jimmy's got eight of those lemon degreaser going
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:32.160]  And then I got this, uh caps trans am
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:34.560]  Shout out to hanging roots
[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:38.480]  He came we saw him at the at the science fair in boston. He was like you got to get those
[02:07:39.120 --> 02:07:40.080]  dutches
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:41.120]  of those
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:43.920]  Yeah, the trans am I got those and then I got um
[02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:49.120]  sticky rich richies, um, uh, pinkleberry f8
[02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:52.160]  But I finally got to get
[02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:54.480]  Some pinkleberry
[02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:56.560]  from kaya
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:08:01.520]  And mr. Richie. Yeah, so I do have the pinkleberry f7. So
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:07.520]  Nice rich is welcome to try and go back into these if he wants. I don't know if he's already done this work
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:11.680]  It sounds like he's already done this work because he's at the one I got is f8 from him
[02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:20.560]  Everybody's taking them in their own in their own direction, you know, like green so I just created it for so long
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:23.600]  Passed it on to kaya and then kaya
[02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:26.960]  um pretty much, um forward it
[02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:33.600]  Forwarded it following his choices, right? I just kind of did the same thing. Um, just
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:41.680]  Different, uh choices, you know what I mean? So I don't know I would um, I think it would be awesome
[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:44.240]  Awesome to try both for sure
[02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:49.600]  Well, I would love to give those almost to you because you've already been through them and you know what you're looking for
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:54.560]  Even though you've taken it in whatever direction you did with the f8s that i'm just popped
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:58.960]  um, but like it was me about supporting all the people that I I like
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:07.120]  I look up to and you know, like now some of this stuff, but now it's about also getting to see them through fruition not just
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:12.720]  Have them because it's not like so i'm so happy. I will definitely share
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:16.480]  some of these with you rich and and definitely with um
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:20.960]  With joshua, I would definitely make it happen because this is medicine and there's these
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:25.600]  These are all every single one of these seeds is a potential for
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:28.960]  Helping somebody, you know, so it's not gonna
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:32.480]  I don't know and it's jason
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:37.200]  It does become like an obsession because it's like oh I gotta have that I gotta have that I gotta have that
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:44.880]  We know nothing about it as as i'm reading in chat, where did it go?
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:48.640]  A couple that grows 420 could never have enough seeds
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:55.280]  That's right. Oh, it's a good thing. It's a couple that grows because there's there is a wonderful
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.480]  There's a wonderful documentary and it's called
[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:01.600]  um
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:03.600]  The
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:05.040]  um
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:07.280]  the truth about seed or the seed the the
[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:09.680]  history of seed
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:17.440]  The history of seed the truth about seed. Oh man, and it's just incredible what we've done to the seed and
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:23.520]  and and how we've weeded down basically the takeaway was we've already basically
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:30.880]  Depleted 90 of our choices for our food 90 the varietals that we could have and it's all because of the
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:38.400]  Yeah, everything everything it's like and then it's just like we're bottlenecked with what we eat too because of that it's just
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:43.440]  It's all related it really is because like these seeds how are we gonna i've
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:46.900]  I've worked around some of the people in that documentary
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:50.900]  My career started in wild crafting
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:54.320]  uh and vegetables and everything and uh
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:11:00.320]  don tipping and williams, uh is a part of that conversation in that documentary seed and
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:03.860]  Uh, you know, that's really my origin to all of this conversation
[02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:08.360]  Is through agriculture, but it's an amazing documentary
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:11.460]  and it is it is
[02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:13.220]  through how uh
[02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:14.320]  how
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:16.320]  monsanto has um
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:18.880]  systematically legally
[02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:26.180]  Disrupted the whole seed chain around the globe and it's it's it's haunting information, but it's important to know it
[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:33.620]  It's pretty downright evil the more that you dig into it because a lot of it's not accident
[02:11:34.740 --> 02:11:39.460]  No, you know, just round up ready round up ready corn easy example
[02:11:41.140 --> 02:11:46.980]  What's the and then they buy all the corn from the indian where they it was like a in the documentary they bought all the corn
[02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:50.580]  Then the the farmer thought oh i'm getting top dollar
[02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:52.660]  I was just gonna go get my seed from my neighbor
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:57.700]  But they bought it all and then they sold them back to gmo stuff that didn't even survive in their climate
[02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:01.700]  They got blight and other stuff and then it just ruined them forever. It was just like
[02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:09.620]  It's crazy, yeah, man, that's like just one of the alarming things that has happened systematically like you said it's not
[02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:11.380]  well
[02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:17.060]  yeah, you know, they want to create the uh, diploids or triploids, uh,
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:21.380]  Unimpregnable cannabis cannabis with no stigmas so they can't
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:26.100]  Reproduce that will happen that will be here. So guys
[02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:29.700]  Keep making seeds. Yeah
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:34.660]  Now what we've been
[02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:36.980]  Call this time the time of kali yuga
[02:12:37.620 --> 02:12:40.420]  And that's 130 000 year time period
[02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:45.460]  And the indian people have like over a million years time on this planet
[02:12:46.100 --> 02:12:49.860]  And the kali yuga time is also ending right now
[02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:53.860]  And so this is that time of great change that we're going through
[02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:56.500]  So, you know, it's a time of mix-up
[02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:00.740]  Things are moving around the world. It's changing as we know it
[02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:03.620]  So
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:06.660]  Kind of similar but completely off topic
[02:13:06.740 --> 02:13:11.940]  I read an article the other day that the core of the earth has stopped spinning and it's going in a different direction now
[02:13:12.180 --> 02:13:14.820]  Which would maybe kind of tie into that but that is so
[02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.620]  Yeah, that that's
[02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:20.100]  It's interesting
[02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:23.700]  The poles are shifting that christians call it the four horses of the apocalypse
[02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:28.260]  There's a lot of different terms and names for it. I've been hanging out with the nasa scientists
[02:13:28.260 --> 02:13:33.700]  That's been showing me that how how true north is moved like 15 degrees over the last
[02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:40.580]  I've physically watched that stuff with my eyes. I didn't know that about the core of the earth. That's that's insane
[02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:47.220]  Yeah, yeah some something like that. You just kind of take for granted as always working like we breathe, you know
[02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:53.720]  We just do it. You never really question it. But uh, I saw that and I was like, oh that's that's interesting
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:56.120]  The
[02:13:56.340 --> 02:14:01.820]  Religion's right about this time this time's prophesized. They know it's happened before it happens
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:06.440]  It happens to humanity. We know that these times exist. It's just been kept
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:12.440]  History, we don't have the knowledge anymore. But when you look truly into it the infrastructure there
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:19.880]  The vedic people talk about it. The old people talk about it the native people on this continent talk about it
[02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:22.980]  2012 is about
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:31.820]  Yeah, I gotta I gotta give a big shout out to another show out there another podcast it's the high on homegrown podcast
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:33.880]  uh
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:41.480]  Based out of the uk with a couple canadians and an american lad on there. But the reason I mention it is uh
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:43.800]  He's been working for
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:51.240]  A long time to get graham hancock who speaks to a lot of these subjects on his weed show and he finally
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:56.140]  Made that a real reality today. So shout out to high on homegrown
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:02.280]  uh for being freaking persistent and getting someone like graham hancock to come on your show because that's
[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:05.960]  That's pretty huge. But graham hancock speaks a lot about these, you know
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:09.400]  past civilizations and you know, uh
[02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:13.560]  Extinction events and stuff of that nature, but
[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:17.720]  Yeah, we we need to we need to save more seed
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:20.520]  And grow different shit
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:23.640]  Quit monograph
[02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:31.000]  Important stuff, you know, yeah, not just cannabis seeds all the vegetables and all of it
[02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:35.900]  Practicing the methods of saving all of your seeds or something. I highly recommend
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:43.080]  There's little tips and tricks to certain ones, you know that not everybody thinks about so just spending time
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:46.680]  Not only just growing your vegetables but thinking about hmm
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:54.280]  How do I save that you know, it's fairly simple most times so you'll find it's really fun to just dive in and practice saving
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:57.080]  Saving all your seeds
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:16:02.200]  Yep. All right. Let me let me before I stone out and forget one more time. Uh, we got

[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:50.280]  He sent me some stuff
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:56.760]  And let's see. This is sultana. Hayes. It is a sv kush times the kandahar red
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:17:59.240]  narif
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:03.160]  uh times original haze purple fino, so
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:07.640]  That's my handwriting. So I have no excuse for not being able to read it, but
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:12.780]  That's that's that'll be my haze contribution to the conversation
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:18.120]  Very cool. Yeah, i've worked with uh maruf red, uh this past season
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:21.080]  Um, it was a irising project
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:23.960]  Tell me about it. I don't know
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:26.920]  It was um
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:33.100]  Brought to me by uh, someone named grandma pain on instagram
[02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:39.020]  And they handed out a whole bunch of them, you know, they they opened irising. Um
[02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:41.180]  found them
[02:18:41.180 --> 02:18:44.300]  out in the kandahar region, um
[02:18:45.020 --> 02:18:47.820]  And there was like two different finos the red and the black
[02:18:48.460 --> 02:18:52.540]  and he had the red and then they um
[02:18:53.500 --> 02:18:59.020]  He kind of open pollinated that and produced a bunch more and handed them out at the regen conference
[02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:01.580]  nice and um
[02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:08.780]  We took those here and spread them out and popped a whole bunch of them and um
[02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:16.720]  Super long long long long long long never even came close to finishing or even throwing any male pollen outdoors
[02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:19.500]  but like we were able to
[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:27.020]  So the pollen the earliest one like a couple of the very earliest ones had some pollen so we were able to use that
[02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:28.540]  um
[02:19:28.540 --> 02:19:31.260]  In a couple things, but I haven't yet. Um
[02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:38.060]  Taken it any further than that. I was going to initially just um, make some selections and just
[02:19:38.860 --> 02:19:43.500]  Continue it down a line now, but I wasn't even able to get quite that far. Um
[02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:46.460]  with the weather here, um
[02:19:47.420 --> 02:19:50.220]  with the specific kandahar reds, um
[02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:53.500]  But I do have 30 more
[02:19:54.700 --> 02:19:58.140]  Yeah, I have a bunch more too a friend of mine gave me all of theirs
[02:19:58.780 --> 02:20:02.380]  Um, so there's plenty of that kind of stock to work with
[02:20:02.940 --> 02:20:03.660]  um
[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:09.660]  Which is cool because they were hardy plants for sure and it just takes some sifting through and finding the right males to work with
[02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:10.780]  I think
[02:20:10.780 --> 02:20:12.380]  um
[02:20:12.380 --> 02:20:17.020]  That's about what I know about the uh, kandahar red currently I know um
[02:20:18.700 --> 02:20:25.340]  Uh the uh family tree is it uh, the creator of pam there he's working with uh,
[02:20:25.420 --> 02:20:27.420]  the the red I believe to
[02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:31.020]  Um, he used a male and a couple crosses
[02:20:32.460 --> 02:20:34.460]  Family tree seeds. Yeah, tyler
[02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:41.100]  Yes, thank you have to find out I heard there's some panama red going around or coming around as well, too
[02:20:41.820 --> 02:20:45.980]  Now that's that's one of those old strains that i'm gonna have to take their word for it
[02:20:46.780 --> 02:20:51.260]  Which is why sourcing is also important with a lot of these things because again
[02:20:52.060 --> 02:20:54.060]  And i've said this before i'm not gonna know
[02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:56.060]  Acapulco gold
[02:20:56.060 --> 02:21:02.540]  I'd love to smoke it and I have smoked some but I again i'm not 100 sure i've ever really smoked it. So
[02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:08.780]  Panama red from a legit source the kandahar red would be uh would be a treat
[02:21:09.580 --> 02:21:11.580]  It sounds like a beast to grow though
[02:21:12.780 --> 02:21:20.220]  I have to uh give my hat off to to rich because he already got into those. Um, the um, um
[02:21:20.780 --> 02:21:26.860]  Gosney that kevin passed out and he already crossed them and made uh, his own, uh,
[02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:29.720]  pollination those were from
[02:21:29.740 --> 02:21:35.180]  Uh same guy from the same project. I think the durand line project kevin's
[02:21:37.820 --> 02:21:40.780]  Now are you just kind of was it not from that or it was
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:45.420]  Are you kind of going for just an open pollination or a seed increase on that?
[02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:51.500]  Because usually i'm gonna grow them out i'm gonna pick my winners i'm gonna decide which one to work with and that takes time
[02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:58.620]  But in the instance where i'm just increasing seeds i'm hitting it the first go before i've even fully flowered it
[02:21:58.700 --> 02:22:02.460]  So what what were you kind of doing there? Which which direction did you go?
[02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:05.160]  generally, um when I
[02:22:05.580 --> 02:22:12.460]  Pop a pack of seeds if it's like a big difference between say a pop a pack of humbled seed companies
[02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:20.300]  Feminized seeds right where I know that they're all going to be pretty uniform somewhat anyways, and uh,
[02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:28.380]  Gosney, uh project right so they have two different outcomes first of all, but when I pop like a gosney
[02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:32.940]  Seeds he gave us all you know, whoever was there like 10 seeds or something
[02:22:33.420 --> 02:22:35.500]  um, so in my mind I need to
[02:22:36.140 --> 02:22:41.420]  See a little bit more so i'm going to open pollinate those 10 seeds with all the males that pop
[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:43.820]  To all the females that are there
[02:22:43.820 --> 02:22:49.180]  and i'm just going to create a bigger lot of seeds to tap into so that we can um,
[02:22:49.580 --> 02:22:53.660]  And then I hand them out to friends just kind of what kevin was intending, you know when he hands them out
[02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:54.700]  he's like
[02:22:54.700 --> 02:23:00.700]  Get these make some more hand them out use a male and um, you know get them into some genetics
[02:23:00.860 --> 02:23:03.260]  And that's what i'm just trying to do just um
[02:23:03.260 --> 02:23:07.420]  Create a bunch more of them so I can hand them out and and that's find any rotting flesh
[02:23:07.420 --> 02:23:10.780]  You remember he said it was from like overripe fruit to rotting flesh
[02:23:11.820 --> 02:23:17.820]  Yeah, I didn't get anything sweet at all. It was all in that like nasty meaty fleshy
[02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:21.820]  Range all the terps that I had off of that chunky
[02:23:22.300 --> 02:23:25.660]  Well, that's you know one thing that I kind of wonder sometimes too, you know
[02:23:25.660 --> 02:23:28.460]  We're talking about wedding cake earlier that it's harder to clone
[02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:31.100]  Sometimes like mac is a notorious slow grower
[02:23:32.140 --> 02:23:36.940]  By kevin like giving out some of these older genetics things that are less bottlenecks, you know
[02:23:37.020 --> 02:23:42.220]  I wonder about that sometimes with the current genetics, you know, like wedding cake is it has it just been bottlenecked?
[02:23:42.220 --> 02:23:48.780]  So you're getting like that recessive depression from just similar traits even though you know it comes from
[02:23:49.820 --> 02:23:53.740]  Animal mints and animal cookies and animal this they're they're different
[02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:57.660]  So I wonder if that is what we are seeing in some of these things and
[02:23:58.060 --> 02:24:00.620]  Something I always try to avoid when i'm putting things together
[02:24:00.620 --> 02:24:04.700]  I try to I try to go opposite ends of the spectrum because I want to reintroduce some vigor
[02:24:05.100 --> 02:24:08.140]  I'm also working for other things but vigor is important to me
[02:24:10.220 --> 02:24:14.220]  Well, they say that you don't even breed anything new if you stay in the same lineage
[02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:19.420]  Right that makes sense. It's called something else. Yeah, I don't know
[02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:24.780]  Right, that makes sense it's called something else I forget the genetic scientific term
[02:24:24.780 --> 02:24:28.700]  But like if you don't breed out of the lineage, you don't create a new variety
[02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:33.420]  So that's fair and that sounds proper but
[02:24:34.060 --> 02:24:36.060]  That's definitely not cannabis
[02:24:36.860 --> 02:24:42.780]  With cannabis has its own. My background is not in cannabis. Yeah me neither. I I do have a
[02:24:43.900 --> 02:24:45.420]  agriculture
[02:24:46.060 --> 02:24:50.140]  Uh degree so yes, that's that's why i'm able to relate as I look at my books
[02:24:50.140 --> 02:24:56.780]  I'm, like that book would actually have the proper name for it. But uh, yeah, this is cannabis like it's not light depth
[02:24:56.940 --> 02:24:59.200]  It's auto periodic interruption
[02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:05.360]  Well, I I yes I love I am a a controlled environment engineer
[02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:08.780]  I grow indoors. So I love that one
[02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:15.020]  Yeah, that that's that's my answer to straight people when they ask me what do you do
[02:25:16.060 --> 02:25:19.920]  Our our first example to growing up is the word cultivar
[02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:22.460]  We're like, yeah
[02:25:22.460 --> 02:25:24.460]  Fine, it means what?
[02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:26.940]  We'll use
[02:25:26.940 --> 02:25:30.620]  You know, but we're just uh, we've adapted our own language and we have
[02:25:31.260 --> 02:25:38.860]  It's just backwoods and back streets and that's why we all loved it, you know, and we're coming into the public now and it's a transition
[02:25:39.660 --> 02:25:45.340]  It is and you know what it works, which is the weird part and the problem with it
[02:25:45.580 --> 02:25:50.220]  and I I had this conversation about indica sativa at the dispensary's the other day, it's like
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:55.820]  Those are completely inaccurate words to use in the context you're using them
[02:25:56.380 --> 02:26:00.300]  But a hundred percent of the people know exactly what you're trying to say. So
[02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:06.540]  While it's totally wrong. We all know the same wrong meaning so it works. Yeah, there are markers
[02:26:07.260 --> 02:26:12.780]  Where yeah, I don't know when and where we're going to correct that but we are saying the word cannabis more often
[02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:14.780]  which I watched a documentary from
[02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:18.540]  Oh gosh, maybe 10 years ago now and every word was like
[02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:21.400]  marijuana
[02:26:21.660 --> 02:26:26.460]  Reaper and I just I kind of cringed at how much they said weed and marijuana and then i'm like
[02:26:27.020 --> 02:26:31.580]  well, we have come a long way because I remember feeling just goofy as hell being like
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:37.520]  Cannabis, but we all stuck to it. Now. That's the most common nomenclature
[02:26:38.300 --> 02:26:40.300]  Unless you're using search results
[02:26:41.500 --> 02:26:43.500]  Hear anything else wise
[02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:51.180]  Yeah, yeah, so well, but nobody knows the bottom of it the real history of the marijuana word like actually it was um,
[02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:54.540]  I got schooled by that from um, dr. Uma
[02:26:55.260 --> 02:27:02.380]  You know, she does a whole presentation about that, you know, very similar on kind of the lines of also jack harer and that you know
[02:27:02.940 --> 02:27:04.940]  emperor of hemp type of
[02:27:05.100 --> 02:27:06.140]  You know
[02:27:06.140 --> 02:27:10.220]  And and she talks about how you know, it was a derogatory term. It was
[02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:16.540]  Yeah, there's so many things that we that are kept from us and that's a whole nother thing of the powers that be they're
[02:27:17.020 --> 02:27:21.900]  Not wanting us to yeah marijuana was to fuel the race war. It was a mexican
[02:27:22.380 --> 02:27:30.460]  Mexican term and the mexican culture like I come from the west coast and my family were cowboys and my grandpa was smoking weed
[02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:38.380]  With the native people so like the natives and the mexicans were always carrying the cannabis out west and that was the original culture
[02:27:39.020 --> 02:27:41.020]  Was a mexican cannabis
[02:27:41.740 --> 02:27:43.980]  culture a slave culture out of the
[02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:47.020]  Caribbean that was carrying the seeds out of africa
[02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:52.960]  And the mexican people and the native people always had a liking to the plant as soon as it showed up in the americas
[02:27:53.580 --> 02:27:56.220]  You know, they're the ones that kept it and carried it
[02:27:57.100 --> 02:27:57.980]  so
[02:27:57.980 --> 02:28:03.580]  you know and yeah, and then it the the term, um in in the uh,
[02:28:04.700 --> 02:28:07.500]  in the indian culture in the um,
[02:28:09.260 --> 02:28:16.300]  There's over like a hundred or maybe even 300 terms for for cannabis
[02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:19.260]  You know they have
[02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:27.100]  They have such a depth so many recipes so many different uses of the plant so many different ways to use the plant
[02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:32.960]  And the the term we're just smoking it, you know, these people have hundreds of recipes
[02:28:33.580 --> 02:28:35.820]  As well as names for it
[02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:43.120]  Um, but the most term that we know from that culture really the original the original
[02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:45.820]  older
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:02.960]  And the word from sanskrit ganja means it means the flower of the plant
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:13.040]  Dude I love your packaging. Do you want to tell me about those the the the the um,
[02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:20.880]  Uh, sorry camels there you got the camels there I see a lot of very cool this this uh,
[02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:24.160]  Also, the font is very
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:27.680]  Uh
[02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:29.680]  I want to say in in you know
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:35.440]  I don't know. There's a it's arabic. Okay. Yeah, my my grandfather's lebanese
[02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:39.600]  Ah, and I was just very proud to
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:43.600]  Represent that part of my heritage and my culture
[02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:49.200]  Um, you know, it's kind of been a race war for arab people in the country for the last
[02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:51.600]  20 years
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:53.600]  And I think it's a part of my heritage
[02:29:53.840 --> 02:29:58.240]  You know, it's kind of been a race war for arab people in the country for the last
[02:29:58.960 --> 02:30:02.240]  20 years and as a cannabis like, uh person
[02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:07.120]  Certain things you kept private in the past, you know, so
[02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:10.480]  um, I was really proud just to
[02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:13.840]  Be able to represent, you know, a lot of my love
[02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:17.200]  For the plant is that cultural space?
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:19.680]  Uh that my family's always carried they were
[02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:21.520]  uh goat
[02:30:21.520 --> 02:30:28.000]  Farmers and uh cannabis people and up in the mountains of lebanon before they immigrated to the united states
[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:30.560]  in the late 1800s
[02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:33.760]  and uh, that was just a way for me to
[02:30:34.480 --> 02:30:37.680]  Be like hey i've been making hash for the last 15 years
[02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:39.280]  and
[02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:41.280]  growing plants and doing genetics
[02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:42.960]  you know like
[02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:46.720]  That silk road has always been walking through us and through our people
[02:30:47.520 --> 02:30:54.800]  Through all of our cultures on the planet and that's that exchange culture where we're able to exchange valuable goods
[02:30:55.360 --> 02:30:57.020]  herbs medicines
[02:30:57.020 --> 02:31:03.620]  Cultural ideas and so that's what the camels represent. Is that silk road? That's all people exchanging
[02:31:04.240 --> 02:31:06.240]  our heritage

[02:33:21.940 --> 02:33:24.500]  seed path, you know, and so, uh
[02:33:25.220 --> 02:33:30.020]  Somebody a friend of mine just brought over some oni seeds. Uh, and it's a

[02:34:40.900 --> 02:34:42.900]  We already have
[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:45.540]  Oh man

[02:34:54.660 --> 02:35:01.480]  Be good stewards of the land. That's the goal be a good imagine when we can get people to say chemovar
[02:35:03.460 --> 02:35:09.780]  That's you know what that's the closest accurate description that we actually could use but a little easier
[02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:20.620]  They're blocking out well cool man, thank you again for your time so much
[02:35:21.020 --> 02:35:24.300]  Um, if you if you hang out if you can hang out, that's cool
[02:35:24.380 --> 02:35:28.640]  If you guys are getting on the road, that's cool, too. I know you had to drive there for uh reception
[02:35:29.180 --> 02:35:32.540]  I've done this before but uh, I appreciate that man
[02:35:33.340 --> 02:35:39.180]  Want to get it over, uh to you john did did you pick out your favorite pack?
[02:35:39.980 --> 02:35:43.020]  Do you have one for us the the end all be all?
[02:35:45.340 --> 02:35:51.200]  I always wanted to grow something from you know, um, rastruth mendelbrot
[02:35:52.140 --> 02:35:54.220]  okay, right and um
[02:35:55.020 --> 02:35:59.420]  so I was you know, I have those seeds from leo that's why I was so coveted but
[02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:02.620]  I don't know what I should do if I should use some like
[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:05.580]  gibberellic acid or
[02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:08.940]  scuff them or crack them or because um
[02:36:10.140 --> 02:36:12.140]  Yeah, they're they're
[02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:15.340]  I you know, I don't know. I know they were growing outdoors. So
[02:36:16.220 --> 02:36:21.180]  Are they not popping you've tried a couple and they just well I did and then I was like I didn't I don't forgot how
[02:36:21.180 --> 02:36:25.660]  Many I got like I probably four and six or something left into each one and I was like, all right
[02:36:25.820 --> 02:36:30.380]  All right, i'm gonna maybe buy that I know tony believe um,
[02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:37.340]  Mr. Toad's got that his little seed cracker there. Yep, but you know, i've not i've inexperienced on what to do
[02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:39.820]  Should I scuff them scarify them, whatever?
[02:36:40.700 --> 02:36:41.740]  crack them
[02:36:41.740 --> 02:36:43.180]  Soak them in something
[02:36:43.180 --> 02:36:44.220]  germaplasm
[02:36:44.220 --> 02:36:49.980]  I'm waiting for that on the ones that I have i'm like it needs to basically be the equivalent of tissue culture
[02:36:50.220 --> 02:36:53.500]  And while they are kind of doing that playing with that now
[02:36:53.740 --> 02:36:58.380]  It's nowhere near the success rate that they'll have in probably three or four years
[02:36:58.940 --> 02:36:59.980]  so
[02:36:59.980 --> 02:37:01.420]  I'll wait
[02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:07.100]  But yeah, i've got I guess i'm I got a lot all this i'm excited for all the stuff that we got with uh, jimmy's
[02:37:07.740 --> 02:37:13.820]  Lemon degreaser and all the other stuff I mentioned earlier, but I also got went back into some pack of the um,
[02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:16.380]  Crocket of uh the golden lemons
[02:37:17.020 --> 02:37:24.700]  So I got five females that i'm gonna be selecting from of this. Uh, which is the um kosher kush times a lemon skunk
[02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:27.580]  Nice, there's a good old kosher kush
[02:37:28.940 --> 02:37:32.460]  That's their jam kosher kush at the melting of the head
[02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:39.580]  At the eugene and a shower sour kosher man. Fuck that stuff is loud as hell
[02:37:40.540 --> 02:37:45.900]  Rivaled your 818 green fino, dude that shit just killed the nose
[02:37:46.620 --> 02:37:50.620]  Oh, we got to try the beckett. Oh gee the beckett the uh, bickett
[02:37:51.180 --> 02:37:58.540]  The big excuse me bickett. That's what i'm saying named after joe keith bickett one of the uh, cornbread mafia. Yep
[02:37:59.340 --> 02:38:01.340]  Yes, they could imbue
[02:38:01.420 --> 02:38:04.380]  Yep. Yep. They could imbue cbd now. That's their jam
[02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:07.420]  Yeah, another cool good. I have two
[02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:18.640]  I have two good varieties that i'm excited for this season. Oh, i'll let you let you say good night my friend
[02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:23.660]  Oh
[02:38:24.940 --> 02:38:26.940]  I can't leave
[02:38:27.260 --> 02:38:29.980]  So I got the uh, the shirt, okay, you got me
[02:38:32.700 --> 02:38:39.020]  You froze and i'm freeze land freeze land mob in the sherb and then the east coast snowblower from our good
[02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:41.180]  Handsome friend rich on the screen there
[02:38:41.980 --> 02:38:43.980]  so i'm
[02:38:44.700 --> 02:38:46.700]  Outside
[02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:52.540]  Where I am we got no snow this year so far, so I don't want to fucking jinx myself, but it's frigid right now
[02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:55.840]  It's like 10 degrees out. He's screwed
[02:38:57.340 --> 02:38:59.340]  If you gotta put it no snow, so
[02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:01.580]  you know
[02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:03.820]  If you're gonna put them outside, when are you gonna pop them?
[02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:06.140]  How long do you keep them inside before you put them out?
[02:39:06.780 --> 02:39:11.900]  Well, I like to get a cut and then flower inside if I have the time so it all depends
[02:39:11.900 --> 02:39:16.220]  But if i'm gonna just pop seeds and put the seeds outside i'll pop them in april
[02:39:17.260 --> 02:39:19.900]  I've learned my lesson about popping them earlier than that
[02:39:20.860 --> 02:39:22.860]  I don't have the space
[02:39:22.940 --> 02:39:27.900]  I had the space and I had a nice farm and a plot of land. I would be popping them now or
[02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:30.460]  earlier
[02:39:30.460 --> 02:39:32.460]  Um
[02:39:32.860 --> 02:39:34.860]  Selecting
[02:39:36.140 --> 02:39:40.060]  Yeah and putting a big plant outside, um because that's where
[02:39:41.500 --> 02:39:43.900]  uh the heart is at but um
[02:39:45.420 --> 02:39:51.820]  So I have a limited height restriction and I can't have taller than seven foot plants this year unfortunately, so
[02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:54.620]  um, I have to stay
[02:39:55.100 --> 02:39:56.780]  short and wide
[02:39:56.780 --> 02:39:57.820]  um
[02:39:57.820 --> 02:40:03.100]  And to do that i'm gonna use my tools. Yeah, exactly. I had a beautiful mac last year
[02:40:03.100 --> 02:40:06.140]  That was like that. It was like a candelabra. John said I think
[02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:12.720]  Yeah, that was the one they got they cut over the fence and took the nice colas
[02:40:15.820 --> 02:40:21.100]  I plant them some ways too. I'll just plant them like laying down on their side
[02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:24.780]  And then i'll just
[02:40:25.260 --> 02:40:29.500]  Pull them down every single time I look at them. I'm pulling down
[02:40:31.100 --> 02:40:36.380]  I just start planting later and later to adjust for the size pretty much because i'm
[02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:43.100]  Dealing with huge plants here is difficult and the seasons and it's just tough to keep them safe. So
[02:40:43.900 --> 02:40:45.020]  um
[02:40:45.020 --> 02:40:51.260]  It's no problem planting all the way to june 1st really even popping seeds and you still get something
[02:40:51.260 --> 02:40:54.460]  They'll be a little they'll be small. They're not going to be big king dogs, right?
[02:40:54.540 --> 02:40:59.660]  But like you'll be able to explore things or sift things or breed with them very easily
[02:41:00.140 --> 02:41:07.900]  Much easier, uh, if you're going for super production, yeah, you can try to start them as early as possible, but it's a serious battle
[02:41:09.740 --> 02:41:15.340]  Yeah, it is a lot of a lot of knowledge to cross yeah right on man for sure
[02:41:15.980 --> 02:41:17.020]  Yeah
[02:41:17.020 --> 02:41:21.420]  So i'm gonna try to get a happy clean those kind of like I can't get in plants
[02:41:21.500 --> 02:41:27.500]  but I you know, but that's so beautiful that the small plants you can work with so many of them and you'd be able to
[02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:28.780]  have more of an
[02:41:28.780 --> 02:41:30.780]  Intimate workability with them, you know
[02:41:30.860 --> 02:41:33.900]  Like be on the same level and kind of just work with them a little bit more
[02:41:34.540 --> 02:41:40.060]  Have more of them in a small space too. I like how you had the maroof red project. We like its own little
[02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:43.100]  Area kind of all nestled together
[02:41:43.980 --> 02:41:50.940]  It's awesome, I imagine that would need its own spot because that's going to do its own damn thing as far as growth
[02:41:51.580 --> 02:41:53.340]  um, yeah
[02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:57.740]  The cool tricks we were able to do not tricks, but just like, um community
[02:41:59.580 --> 02:42:01.580]  Efforts, right like
[02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:07.100]  Massachusetts has certain laws. So we all have to keep within our numbers right as home growers
[02:42:07.500 --> 02:42:10.620]  Med cards have different rules as a regular person
[02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:13.500]  But even between that, you know each household
[02:42:13.660 --> 02:42:19.340]  I have a lot of friends around here in the hill towns that don't necessarily even smoke, but don't mind us
[02:42:20.300 --> 02:42:25.260]  Um managing, uh their legal amount on their property for them in their name, right?
[02:42:25.420 --> 02:42:31.660]  So you just get a bunch of friends and you can actually get through a bunch of material legally. No problems
[02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:38.140]  um, and you know not be looking over your shoulder, but still manage to um, you know, at least
[02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:40.620]  Um look through a bunch of stuff
[02:42:41.020 --> 02:42:45.500]  Or do whichever you'd like to do like you say separate the maroof red project from the guys
[02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:51.420]  Project and get them very far away each time. I'd like to have them in a hoop house
[02:42:51.420 --> 02:42:53.420]  So i'm not really blowing anybody
[02:42:53.660 --> 02:42:55.180]  away, um
[02:42:55.180 --> 02:43:02.700]  If there is a neighbor who's kind, um, yeah, not just throwing pollen everywhere, you know, it's got to be somewhat. Um,
[02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:06.940]  Respectful at least control. Yeah
[02:43:07.340 --> 02:43:09.740]  Yeah, controlled and purposeful about what you do
[02:43:10.460 --> 02:43:11.740]  very important
[02:43:11.740 --> 02:43:13.740]  when you're growing outdoors, uh
[02:43:14.140 --> 02:43:17.980]  Be considerate of the neighbors because man you pollinate somebody else's crop
[02:43:18.460 --> 02:43:24.940]  As good as your intention was to make seeds for other people like dude, you just ruined that person's day. So yeah, that's
[02:43:26.220 --> 02:43:31.420]  Or their year or you're right. Yeah their year you're yeah their business
[02:43:32.220 --> 02:43:33.420]  Yeah
[02:43:33.420 --> 02:43:35.580]  Yeah, so that's that's always a concern
[02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:37.820]  um, but
[02:43:37.820 --> 02:43:43.740]  I'm on the west side of washington on the coast. So I don't grow outdoors not a chance. So
[02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:46.380]  I don't have to worry about that
[02:43:46.620 --> 02:43:51.500]  Uh, but I wish I could again grow one of those big mendo dope plants, man
[02:43:51.580 --> 02:43:57.260]  That's a life goal one of these days. I will i'll have my 20 pounder but uh, not until I move
[02:43:58.140 --> 02:44:04.940]  We're on the 16 pound plant. No chill with permaculture practices. That was the doc c that I have
[02:44:05.900 --> 02:44:07.900]  That's damn and three
[02:44:08.940 --> 02:44:10.940]  And what's the cross on the doc c

[02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:49.500]  Especially the eddie lap story was far out man. I loved it
[02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:54.620]  Thank you. Like it was it was a real treat working on the dope history project
[02:44:55.080 --> 02:45:00.460]  Particularly because like some of the interviews tad already had now obviously the interview with eddie left
[02:45:00.780 --> 02:45:03.980]  He already had but what he turned over to me was just like
[02:45:04.460 --> 02:45:10.620]  Gold a couple hours of audio to work with to sculpt to shape into what that episode is
[02:45:11.100 --> 02:45:18.220]  But dude being able just to listen to him talk for two hours. And as you saw, you know, he he went through a lot
[02:45:18.700 --> 02:45:20.300]  um
[02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:27.180]  Priceless dude priceless. I'm so fortunate to have been involved with that project and had that chance. So
[02:45:27.980 --> 02:45:30.540]  But yeah the og eddie let man that's cool
[02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:39.040]  That's a part of that and that's amazing that it's such a good production plant too like, uh, yeah production and turkeys
[02:45:40.380 --> 02:45:43.820]  For that variety, that's what I got second in the state with too, you know
[02:45:43.820 --> 02:45:48.620]  I mean, it's like of course like these things are there for a reason these road markers in the industry
[02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:54.800]  Shiloh massive and third gen these people are important eddie left or these people are important
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:59.520]  That's why I grow that variety, you know, um, it's it's for
[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:06.800]  It's for the legacy. It's so people we have these road markers these points to come back to
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:13.520]  Yo, joshua i'm proud of you bro. So I don't want you to be humble. Tell them what you just won over there in argonne
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:23.840]  Uh, yeah, well second place close to winning, um, the second place trophy theta oregon for outdoor
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:27.680]  Congratulations
[02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:31.040]  But I thought you won two awards bro, I thought you won two
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:32.800]  I'm, sorry
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:38.800]  Uh, no, uh-uh just that I mean I I've placed maybe seventh or something with another variety too
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:44.720]  But uh, yeah that just that one and it was my first time in the contest
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:51.840]  Well, that's maybe maybe it was prior you won. You've also won for some from for some rosin or hash or something
[02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:56.480]  Or was this not at that contest but i've won a lot of trophies
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:47:01.200]  Contests for years that one that one was a true honor though. There's so many
[02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:05.760]  uh of oregon's best competitor there and it was
[02:47:06.480 --> 02:47:09.520]  Yeah, I was it was an honor, you know, I recognized that that
[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:15.200]  My team worked so hard this year. I literally made every single fertilizer from the land
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:23.600]  Fermented everything from and you know, like I get my seaweed from the ocean like it's it's full warrior medicine big heart
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:26.640]  You know, and it's it feels good to be recognized for the hard work
[02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:35.280]  Congratulations for that and as a washingtonian I will fully readily admit oregon has got way better weed than washington
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:37.440]  So that's just what it is
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:38.880]  It's okay
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:45.760]  I i've learned so much about hash making and genetics from washington from the head from the original seattle fair
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:47.760]  We were the concentrate people
[02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:55.520]  I'm not i'm not as strange to what goes on in the screen who's played what role around the country, you know
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:48:00.480]  In washington, I mean my hash partners are from washington still to this day
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:01.920]  so
[02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:06.000]  No, it's we all have our roles that we play, you know each state
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:12.800]  Yeah, no very very true washington definitely had dominated for a long time over oregon
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:19.460]  We'd always have the conversations because i'd be down there for flower and they'd be like I need to get up there for concentrate
[02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:21.840]  So yeah
[02:48:21.840 --> 02:48:28.960]  Uh, well, let's wrap this up here. Sticky richie. I want to ask you, you know that last question too. We're pulling out our
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:30.080]  Our
[02:48:30.080 --> 02:48:36.080]  number one numero uno pack that we had whether it's uh for preservation or something you're gonna pop next so
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:38.640]  I pose that question to you, sir
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:41.760]  What what's the one that we're gonna close it out with?
[02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:44.320]  For me, it's not necessarily
[02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:51.600]  like the most precious thing I just was uh recently really inspired to pop these because um
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:59.360]  I recently popped open a jar of a cross that a friend and I collaborated on
[02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:02.240]  and um, it's uh
[02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:08.720]  A strain I created called candied limes, which is a cross of rainbow chip times tahiti lime
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:12.800]  Um, and we crossed that to the lemon snow cone
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000]  And um
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:24.000]  They were all a certain way right and one of them came out like an extreme outlier like this
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:31.840]  Straight up orange tic tac thing, which was like totally different than the rest of them and um
[02:49:32.800 --> 02:49:34.400]  so delicious and
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:37.120]  Just yummy that i've been smoking it a bunch. So i'm
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:47.680]  Taking a candid lime and uh, I crossed it to the black cherry punch that I hunted out. Um
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:48.960]  from
[02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:50.960]  in-house genetics a while ago
[02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:54.400]  So I want to see what I can get out of those
[02:49:54.720 --> 02:49:58.980]  So that's the next one i'm popping and to see if I can see something interesting
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:04.240]  Um, so it's black cherry punch times. Candy lime rainbow chip times tahiti lime
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:06.080]  um
[02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:07.680]  and um
[02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:10.880]  I don't know something about just getting inspired by
[02:50:11.440 --> 02:50:15.760]  One of the phenol hunts and seeing something dramatically different than all the rest and you just go for it
[02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:18.880]  You know, that's where I went with this one and that's what i'm gonna do
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:21.680]  Check it out
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:24.500]  Awesome, man, that'll be that'll be exciting
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:32.480]  packed full of flavor I bet too and incidentally before he's gonna be I don't think I can make it bro, but
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:36.240]  You're are you gonna be at the gene traders? They can get your gear out there
[02:50:37.120 --> 02:50:39.120]  No, no
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:42.800]  Sorry my bad

[02:52:16.720 --> 02:52:20.800]  small farm type co-ops and businesses trying to let
[02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:25.280]  us even get a chance to play here in this market between
[02:52:26.080 --> 02:52:29.440]  between the mso's dominating it and um
[02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:33.760]  You know microbial threshold is being so strict. It has to be sterile
[02:52:34.400 --> 02:52:36.400]  Uh, it's a real tough
[02:52:36.460 --> 02:52:42.800]  Radiated. Yeah, it's it's a really incredible situation. So we've been really working hard to change that
[02:52:43.280 --> 02:52:46.800]  So some of these small farmers around here can take part in the industry
[02:52:47.600 --> 02:52:48.720]  um
