[00:00.000 --> 00:04.400]  So you have a farm up in Santa Barbara?
[00:04.400 --> 00:08.640]  Yes, yes. Mr. Nice Guy LLC is our farm in Santa Barbara.
[00:08.640 --> 00:12.000]  Santa Maria line.
[00:12.000 --> 00:15.200]  Are you growing just cannabis or are you growing all sorts of vegetables?
[00:15.200 --> 00:18.800]  Yes, we're a cannabis grower up there. We have seven acres
[00:18.800 --> 00:22.600]  under hoop house.
[00:22.600 --> 00:25.400]  We're doing it in large pots, large plants.
[00:25.400 --> 00:28.600]  100 gallons, 200 gallons? 260.
[00:29.600 --> 00:32.400]  260 gallon smart pots.
[00:32.400 --> 00:37.800]  We use worm casting, biochar, heat moss,
[00:37.800 --> 00:42.800]  obviously some micro-hyzae and stuff mixed into the soil.
[00:42.800 --> 00:48.000]  We found, it's something we've done in the past,
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.800]  but it'll be better soil this year than it was last year
[00:51.800 --> 00:55.600]  because it got hot.
[00:55.800 --> 01:00.200]  So as you probably know, when you first get raw biochar,
[01:00.200 --> 01:03.000]  it has to be primed. It has to be activated.
[01:03.000 --> 01:07.200]  Because there's a thin sheen on the surface of the char that's an organic material
[01:07.200 --> 01:10.800]  that's partially blocking the binding sites for the NPK.
[01:10.800 --> 01:16.000]  So unless it's fully activated, you might expect it to be hot.
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.000]  But if the char is activated, is prepared,
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.200]  that eliminates that problem entirely. So I think you'll probably see this year
[01:25.200 --> 01:31.200]  or maybe even next year, you'll start to see the benefit for sure.
[01:31.200 --> 01:33.000]  That's one of the value propositions of char,
[01:33.000 --> 01:35.800]  is it allows you to be more efficient with your inputs,
[01:35.800 --> 01:39.800]  whether it's water or plant nutrients. We have to be more efficient.
[01:39.800 --> 01:44.000]  I mean, that's kind of one of the bottom lines of a regenerative farming model,
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.400]  is be efficient with your plant nutrients. No runoff.
[01:49.400 --> 01:53.200]  Yeah, we had zero runoff.
[01:53.400 --> 01:58.800]  Advantage of smart pots, you know, and I'm a fan of letting it dry pretty thoroughly.
[01:58.800 --> 02:02.600]  Yes. So I mean, we were only in those size pots.
[02:02.600 --> 02:07.400]  We were only needing to feed once every five to seven days.
[02:07.400 --> 02:10.500]  That's kind of the beautiful thing of this, these cocoa media.
[02:10.500 --> 02:12.200]  So we've basically got two types of media here.
[02:12.200 --> 02:18.400]  We've got a more traditional mix, peat, perlite and koya.
[02:18.400 --> 02:21.700]  And then these are pure cocoa.
[02:21.700 --> 02:24.900]  Obviously, we really should leave the peat in the ground.
[02:24.900 --> 02:27.800]  And this is, again, more of a traditional public aid commission.
[02:27.800 --> 02:31.500]  This is what some people want. But the difference between,
[02:31.500 --> 02:35.500]  we've got these two right here have about a day's worth of nutrient in them.
[02:35.500 --> 02:38.100]  These three have about four to six weeks worth of nutrients.
[02:38.100 --> 02:42.600]  So we're taking advantage of that ability of char to retain, to hold on to nutrients.
[02:42.600 --> 02:47.900]  So it creates this system where the plants release exudates out of their root structures,
[02:47.900 --> 02:51.400]  signaling the microbiology to mobilize the nutrients.
[02:51.400 --> 02:55.100]  So instead of using salt-based nutrients, I'm not saying you do,
[02:55.100 --> 02:59.600]  but salt-based nutrient feeders are essentially forcing the plant to feed.
[02:59.600 --> 03:01.700]  Right. With automatic pressure.
[03:01.700 --> 03:03.900]  This way, since they're a living system,
[03:03.900 --> 03:08.100]  the plants get exactly what they want, when they want it, how they want it.
[03:08.100 --> 03:11.700]  That allows them to more fully express their chemotype,
[03:11.700 --> 03:14.800]  whether it's the terpenoid or cannabinoid signatures.
[03:14.800 --> 03:18.000]  We're seeing consistently boosts of that, again,
[03:18.100 --> 03:24.900]  because these systems are optimized for efficiencies, driven by the plant, not by the farmer.
[03:24.900 --> 03:33.100]  So have you noticed how your salt nutrient mixes react with the biochar?
[03:33.100 --> 03:37.900]  You will have to cut back on your nutrient packages pretty dramatically.
[03:37.900 --> 03:40.900]  And that's part of the savings, part of the efficiencies, right?
[03:40.900 --> 03:47.000]  You know, consistently 40 to 50 percent pullback of the nutrients.
[03:47.100 --> 03:54.000]  We're actually down to about 25 percent of what people would normally expect.
[03:54.000 --> 03:59.800]  You know, I'm a fan of the less is more sometimes, you know.
[03:59.800 --> 04:03.100]  And I found that over years and years of growing, actually indoors.
[04:03.100 --> 04:08.900]  Indoors is my expertise. I did it for a long time.
[04:08.900 --> 04:14.700]  Santa Barbara is our first go in a big, big outdoor situation.
[04:14.900 --> 04:18.600]  You know, it's weird out of San Fernando Valley.
[04:18.600 --> 04:22.600]  And then I was also in Montana for a long time.
[04:26.100 --> 04:30.800]  So on my indoor shows, I became a big fan of cocoa.
[04:30.800 --> 04:38.600]  Specifically because cocoa, and the reason for because is the lack of bugs in it.
[04:38.700 --> 04:46.100]  Because it's sterilized to 800 degrees and it's worth the extra money to have it sterilized.
[04:46.100 --> 04:51.500]  You know, and then, you know, yes, I mean, I've heard it described a million times.
[04:51.500 --> 04:57.500]  You know, cocoa is like, you know, hydroponics on training wheels.
[04:57.500 --> 05:02.200]  But, you know, but I like it because there's a buffer there.
[05:02.200 --> 05:06.900]  There's room for mistake, you know, growing in rockwool for a long time.
[05:06.900 --> 05:13.200]  You fail a pump, you fail a drip system. It's overnight, you have a nightmare problem.
[05:13.200 --> 05:15.900]  Not to mention rockwool is not a sustainable material.
[05:15.900 --> 05:18.700]  It's extraction from the planet. It's just not a good idea.
[05:18.700 --> 05:19.700]  There are better solutions.
[05:19.700 --> 05:24.600]  There are better solutions. And I mean, cocoa for me was the solution.
[05:24.600 --> 05:31.600]  Because it just, it was alive, number one, but at the same time it was sterile.
[05:31.700 --> 05:39.200]  So it really allowed me to monitor my pH balance, my feeding program, you know.
[05:39.200 --> 05:43.000]  Yeah, there's some potassium in there, but that doesn't hurt me.
[05:43.000 --> 05:51.400]  You know, and it allowed me, you're training a crew, right?
[05:51.400 --> 05:56.700]  And I mean, let's face it, we enjoy the cannabis plant.
[05:56.700 --> 05:59.500]  Sometimes things get forgot.
[05:59.500 --> 06:03.600]  It provides a measure of resilience in the practice, in the growing practice,
[06:03.600 --> 06:05.500]  which in general we want climate resilience.
[06:05.500 --> 06:11.100]  We want to have flexibility in the system like a reed blowing in the wind, doesn't break.
[06:11.100 --> 06:14.500]  You just modulate with your environment around you and then you can dial it in.
[06:14.500 --> 06:18.500]  And this obviously provides some water retention capacity.
[06:18.500 --> 06:20.600]  So this is long and short fiber cocoa.
[06:20.600 --> 06:26.400]  What we've done is we've bundled two different strains to create, to maximize air filled porosity.
[06:26.400 --> 06:28.700]  Right. And then added the biochar.
[06:28.700 --> 06:34.700]  And then we add the base. So the base is, as I said, we take the char, we inoculate it with beneficials,
[06:34.700 --> 06:38.700]  we add the organic nutrient packages and we incubate it for a month.
[06:38.700 --> 06:43.900]  And outcomes are base. And the amount of base, so do you find with this,
[06:43.900 --> 06:49.900]  you don't have to use additives of the beneficial bacterias and stuff? It's already there.
[06:49.900 --> 06:52.900]  So you don't need to like top dress with compote teas?
[06:53.100 --> 06:58.900]  You can. All it's going to do is boost the acceleration of biomass, of chlorophyll.
[06:58.900 --> 07:04.900]  So it's not like it's bad, but I don't know if you get anything better out of it, frankly.
[07:06.900 --> 07:09.900]  You know, that's fascinating. That's fascinating.
[07:09.900 --> 07:13.900]  I wouldn't have considered using a biochar, mixing it in.
[07:13.900 --> 07:19.900]  Just because you're so conscious of being sterile and inert when you're doing an indoor thing,
[07:19.900 --> 07:21.900]  because then you're monitoring your food.
[07:21.900 --> 07:27.900]  We create this mix indoors, intentionally, to eliminate pathogens.
[07:31.900 --> 07:36.900]  But couldn't you create something outdoors where the beneficials outcompete the pathogens?
[07:36.900 --> 07:42.900]  You can. I mean, it's a pretty delicate system. I'm not sure I can actually modulate that system.
[07:42.900 --> 07:46.900]  I think in theory, with ecological theory, yes. But we're interested in efficiency here.
[07:46.900 --> 07:50.900]  We're interested in creating mixes that can be scaled, that people can use.
[07:50.900 --> 07:54.900]  These are essentially climate-smart soils. That's the narrative we're trying to describe.
[07:54.900 --> 07:59.900]  We need to adopt climate-smart technologies, whether it's in transportation, like the Prius,
[07:59.900 --> 08:03.900]  regenerative farming, all of us have to activate climate-smart technologies.
[08:03.900 --> 08:07.900]  And this is what this is. This is drawdown. This is based on atmospheric carbon.
[08:07.900 --> 08:12.900]  Yeah, unfortunately, it's pretty hard to transport a pallet of dirt in a Prius.
[08:12.900 --> 08:17.900]  Yeah, that's... Well, so I was on the Prius design team. Literally.
[08:17.900 --> 08:19.900]  I worked for Toyota before I started this company.
[08:19.900 --> 08:20.900]  And I own a Prius.
[08:20.900 --> 08:29.900]  And that took us a long time to dial in. But there will be a... We're working now on a hybrid truck.
[08:29.900 --> 08:33.900]  I'm still involved with Toyota. Like, once a Toyota guy, you never really leave it.
[08:33.900 --> 08:36.900]  I worked for Google for a couple of years. Like, once a Googler, you're always a Googler.
[08:36.900 --> 08:43.900]  Yeah, I mean, the problem with that whole thing is you're going to have to get them to have a range of 700 miles.
[08:44.900 --> 08:48.900]  And until we hit that mark, an electric truck is just...
[08:49.900 --> 08:55.900]  You know, because I'm the kind of guy, you know, I'll have to run to Santa Barbara, to Salinas, and back in a day.
[08:55.900 --> 09:01.900]  And a 200-mile range, 250-mile range will leave me abandoned on the side of the road.
[09:01.900 --> 09:06.900]  So one solution there is the fuel cell. You know, Toyota has a fuel cell car out right now.
[09:06.900 --> 09:10.900]  They're working MRI. The next generation comes out in two years.
[09:10.900 --> 09:13.900]  Instead of having a range of 250 miles, they're going to have a range of 450 miles.
[09:13.900 --> 09:17.900]  That's an electric car. You're just making the electricity real-time.
[09:17.900 --> 09:24.900]  So they're testing a fuel cell semi. Again, giving you range that's competitive with diesel.
[09:24.900 --> 09:28.900]  Because that's all we have to do, is be competitive with the substitution fuel.
[09:28.900 --> 09:29.900]  Right.
[09:29.900 --> 09:30.900]  Right?
[09:30.900 --> 09:31.900]  Absolutely.
[09:31.900 --> 09:32.900]  And then you're off to the races.
[09:32.900 --> 09:35.900]  That's why I'm stuck in a diesel truck right now. I'm a farmer.
[09:36.900 --> 09:42.900]  What are some nutrients that, between the two of you, you think farmers don't pay enough attention to?
[09:42.900 --> 09:46.900]  Like in terms of what their benefit is to the plant, and they kind of neglect?
[09:46.900 --> 09:54.900]  I noticed it's mostly silica is what people leave out of their regimen.
[09:54.900 --> 09:56.900]  You know, it's mostly silica.
[09:56.900 --> 10:04.900]  And everybody's familiar with your NPK and your two-step or three-step, you know, A and B kind of thing.
[10:05.900 --> 10:10.900]  But I find that most of them have no concept of the necessity of silica.
[10:10.900 --> 10:14.900]  Just a little bit. It only takes a little bit.
[10:14.900 --> 10:16.900]  Pro-Tech is an amazing product.
[10:16.900 --> 10:22.900]  You know, I mean, that's the number one thing I see with most growers leaving out.
[10:22.900 --> 10:25.900]  Most of them are familiar with beneficial bacterias.
[10:25.900 --> 10:29.900]  Most of them are familiar with micro-Isa. They're all over it.
[10:29.900 --> 10:33.900]  But they're leaving out the silica.
[10:33.900 --> 10:36.900]  And it's essential.
[10:36.900 --> 10:40.900]  And what is the effect when you're deficient in silica?
[10:40.900 --> 10:45.900]  The silica just keeps your roots cleaner. Everything's picking up faster.
[10:45.900 --> 10:50.900]  I mean, it just helps everything.
[10:50.900 --> 10:55.900]  And you're able, with that little bit of silica, because it's picking up so much better,
[10:55.900 --> 10:59.900]  even with the micros and your beneficial bacterias,
[11:00.900 --> 11:06.900]  that my feeding program is a quarter of what most people would think.
[11:06.900 --> 11:07.900]  It's a what?
[11:07.900 --> 11:08.900]  A quarter.
[11:08.900 --> 11:13.900]  He's saving 75% of his inputs by optimizing the efficiency of his system
[11:13.900 --> 11:18.900]  with smart micro-macronutrient application and living soils.
[11:18.900 --> 11:21.900]  Because I would say that's one of the missing pieces I see,
[11:21.900 --> 11:26.900]  is there are the regenerative farmers and then there are the salt-based farmers
[11:26.900 --> 11:31.900]  force-feeding the plants as opposed to activating microbiology to deliver nutrients on demand.
[11:31.900 --> 11:35.900]  I don't dislike salt-based nutrient programs.
[11:35.900 --> 11:39.900]  It's just 90% of the people that I watch do it over-feed them.
[11:39.900 --> 11:41.900]  They feed them to death.
[11:41.900 --> 11:47.900]  It's like they look great through week 7 or 8 of veg,
[11:47.900 --> 11:51.900]  and then all of a sudden they're burning tips.
[11:51.900 --> 11:54.900]  It just becomes horrible really quickly.
[11:54.900 --> 11:56.900]  And it's feeding them to death.
[11:56.900 --> 11:58.900]  It's loving them to death.
[11:58.900 --> 12:01.900]  It's like, dude, less is more.
[12:01.900 --> 12:05.900]  It's a farmer-controlled system instead of a biology-controlled system.
[12:05.900 --> 12:06.900]  Right?
[12:06.900 --> 12:07.900]  Right.
[12:07.900 --> 12:10.900]  You want to activate the biology.
[12:10.900 --> 12:12.900]  Let's biomimic natural systems.
[12:12.900 --> 12:18.900]  So if you activate the biology, get that plant picking up its nutrients really well,
[12:18.900 --> 12:20.900]  and then use a feed program.
[12:21.900 --> 12:29.900]  So outdoors, we did some serious tests on our soil to see what was in it to begin with
[12:29.900 --> 12:32.900]  and what we can now leave out of our feeding program,
[12:32.900 --> 12:35.900]  what we had to supplement later on.
[12:37.900 --> 12:39.900]  And you're moving into hemp, right?
[12:39.900 --> 12:41.900]  I'm moving into hemp in a week.
[12:41.900 --> 12:43.900]  So you're planting in the ground.
[12:43.900 --> 12:45.900]  So yeah, this year we're going into hemp.
[12:45.900 --> 12:51.900]  There's a lot to learn there because this will be the first year row cropping it directly into the ground.
[12:51.900 --> 12:54.900]  We have our soil tests.
[12:54.900 --> 12:56.900]  We have that.
[12:56.900 --> 13:00.900]  We will be using a salt-based program because it's efficient to feed.
[13:02.900 --> 13:07.900]  But not heavy dosages, not getting carried away.
[13:07.900 --> 13:11.900]  We have seven strains that we're going to be working this year.
[13:12.900 --> 13:13.900]  On the hemp side?
[13:13.900 --> 13:14.900]  On the hemp side.
[13:14.900 --> 13:17.900]  And going in blind.
[13:17.900 --> 13:20.900]  I mean, literally, I have found just like cannabis.
[13:20.900 --> 13:23.900]  I expect it to be just like cannabis.
[13:23.900 --> 13:27.900]  The seed we got isn't necessarily the seed they advertise.
[13:27.900 --> 13:30.900]  What are some of the strains you're exploring and why?
[13:31.900 --> 13:33.900]  So I would have to get my list out.
[13:34.900 --> 13:38.900]  But basically, I got two strains out of the Colorado market.
[13:38.900 --> 13:40.900]  I got a strain out of Kentucky.
[13:40.900 --> 13:42.900]  I got two strains out of Oregon.
[13:42.900 --> 13:44.900]  We got a strain out of Spain.
[13:44.900 --> 13:46.900]  And we got a strain out of Israel.
[13:47.900 --> 13:49.900]  They're all the root aralis.
[13:49.900 --> 13:51.900]  And your farm is where?
[13:51.900 --> 13:53.900]  So it's in Santa Paula.
[13:53.900 --> 13:57.900]  We have 60 acres we're putting into the ground in Santa Paula.
[13:57.900 --> 13:58.900]  Santa Paula.
[13:58.900 --> 13:59.900]  Which is where?
[13:59.900 --> 14:04.900]  Just this side of Fillmore in the Oxnard Valley.
[14:04.900 --> 14:06.900]  Santa Rosa, Santa Paula, Fillmore.
[14:07.900 --> 14:13.900]  And so is the idea that you have no idea what's going to respond to that microclimate?
[14:13.900 --> 14:15.900]  I have no idea what's going to respond.
[14:15.900 --> 14:17.900]  So we're going to try.
[14:17.900 --> 14:20.900]  Or what the final tests are going to be.
[14:20.900 --> 14:25.900]  You know, with hemp we've got to maintain this ridiculous less than 0.3.
[14:25.900 --> 14:27.900]  Right? I mean...
[14:29.900 --> 14:31.900]  This guy knows a thing about hemp.
[14:31.900 --> 14:32.900]  Yeah. Yeah.
[14:32.900 --> 14:33.900]  This year.
[14:34.900 --> 14:37.900]  We're growing 60 acres in Santa Paula this year.
[14:38.900 --> 14:41.900]  You had mentioned biomimicry.
[14:41.900 --> 14:46.900]  So like what are some biomimicry concepts that are applied to making soil?
[14:49.900 --> 14:51.900]  In our case we're biomimicry fire.
[14:53.900 --> 14:55.900]  Fire creates biochar.
[14:55.900 --> 14:58.900]  That's the natural mechanism to regenerate soils.
[14:59.900 --> 15:00.900]  So I have a question.
[15:00.900 --> 15:06.900]  Can you harvest biochar and help out with like charcoal power plants and stuff?
[15:07.900 --> 15:08.900]  Say more about that.
[15:08.900 --> 15:10.900]  How would I harvest?
[15:10.900 --> 15:19.900]  Well, you know, in the burning of charcoal you have all of those carbon emissions that are such a problem.
[15:19.900 --> 15:25.900]  And if we could directly harvest those back out, because they're not bad for growing,
[15:25.900 --> 15:26.900]  You mean in power plants?
[15:26.900 --> 15:28.900]  Like power plants.
[15:29.900 --> 15:37.900]  You know, the things that are coming off the smokestacks, all of that carbon and CO2 that's being pumped through the atmosphere.
[15:38.900 --> 15:43.900]  How do we go about harvesting that back and putting it directly into a soil?
[15:43.900 --> 15:47.900]  There's a whole immersion industry around direct air capture.
[15:49.900 --> 15:51.900]  But you're probably not...
[15:51.900 --> 15:52.900]  Yeah, help yourself.
[15:52.900 --> 16:00.170]  You're probably going to use that carbon not to create charcoal, but to create graphene batteries.
[16:02.170 --> 16:04.170]  Or roads.
[16:07.170 --> 16:09.170]  Or cements.
[16:10.170 --> 16:17.170]  There's a bunch of immersion industries that are going to repurpose atmospheric carbon and do something useful with it.
[16:17.170 --> 16:21.170]  Since you're rebranding a problem molecule, CO2, into a solution molecule.
[16:21.170 --> 16:25.170]  Whether it's for regenerative ag, whether it's for next generation cars.
[16:26.170 --> 16:32.170]  That was just one of the thoughts I had when I was playing with the biochar for the first time this year.
[16:33.170 --> 16:34.170]  Was I wonder.
[16:34.170 --> 16:35.170]  You know?
[16:36.170 --> 16:40.170]  Because, you know, because you know,
[16:40.170 --> 16:43.170]  Obviously fossil fuels are with us for a while longer.
[16:44.170 --> 16:50.170]  But if we can figure out a way to make them not so dirty and reclaim some of that carbon.
[16:50.170 --> 16:52.170]  Yep, absolutely.
[16:52.170 --> 16:54.170]  Put it into the growth cycle.
[16:55.170 --> 16:56.170]  It's a win-win.
[16:57.170 --> 17:01.170]  Unfortunately, what most people are now doing with that captured CO2,
[17:02.170 --> 17:04.170]  is they're using it to make a new fuel.
[17:04.170 --> 17:05.170]  It's a win-win.
[17:06.170 --> 17:10.170]  Unfortunately, what most people are now doing with that captured CO2,
[17:11.170 --> 17:15.170]  is they're injecting it into old oil wells to get more oil out.
[17:19.020 --> 17:21.020]  That's the big market right now for CO2.
[17:22.020 --> 17:24.020]  I can see that.
[17:24.020 --> 17:25.020]  I can see that.
[17:26.020 --> 17:29.020]  It was just one of the thoughts I was having.
[17:29.020 --> 17:35.020]  I was just in a discussion where a guy figured out how to make plastics out of seashells.
[17:37.020 --> 17:39.020]  Which I thought was amazing.
[17:40.020 --> 17:43.020]  You have those stacks and stacks and stacks of oyster shells.
[17:45.020 --> 17:47.020]  Piles and piles and piles of them.
[17:47.020 --> 17:50.020]  Can you imagine making biochar out of hemp residue?
[17:51.020 --> 17:52.020]  Well, why not?
[17:53.020 --> 17:54.020]  Why not?
[17:54.020 --> 17:56.020]  We have piles and piles and piles of stock right now.
[17:56.020 --> 17:58.020]  That we can't do anything with.
[17:59.020 --> 18:01.020]  We don't yet have the hemp market.
[18:02.020 --> 18:08.020]  There's not the processing infrastructure to do anything besides making oil for CBD.
[18:09.020 --> 18:15.020]  Your main output is going to basically be oil, right?
[18:16.020 --> 18:17.020]  Yes, absolutely.
[18:18.020 --> 18:20.020]  Not clothing or plastic.
[18:21.020 --> 18:23.020]  No, we don't have that infrastructure yet.
[18:23.020 --> 18:29.020]  Much as we'd like to bail up the stock and ship it somewhere and make a dollar off of that,
[18:30.020 --> 18:34.020]  we don't really have anywhere here set up.
[18:35.020 --> 18:37.020]  Are you allowed to compost it on site?
[18:38.020 --> 18:39.020]  Yes.
[18:40.020 --> 18:43.020]  Do you have some sort of composting strategy?
[18:44.020 --> 18:51.020]  Our plan, actually, will be pretty much the same thing we did with all of our stocks.
[18:51.020 --> 18:55.020]  The same thing we did with all of our stock this year off the cannabis garden.
[18:56.020 --> 19:00.020]  Just make a big pile, light it on fire, spread those ashes and use it in our soil.
[19:01.020 --> 19:03.020]  I mean, that's what we did.
[19:04.020 --> 19:10.020]  So from a biochar perspective, would there be a way to not light it on fire, but to turn it into biochar?
[19:11.020 --> 19:14.020]  Well, it's not just carbon, though. It's all these micronutrients as well.
[19:15.020 --> 19:19.020]  So the ash of a fire is all the other nutrients besides carbon.
[19:19.020 --> 19:23.020]  It becomes an awesome potash and just makes your soil richer.
[19:24.020 --> 19:28.020]  But I thought the whole concept of biochar is you heat it to just before it does combust.
[19:29.020 --> 19:31.020]  You're not, like biochar is not ash, right?
[19:32.020 --> 19:33.020]  You're almost making it a coal.
[19:34.020 --> 19:35.020]  Here's a diagram.
[19:36.020 --> 19:40.020]  The axis here is temperature. This is low temperature. This is high temperature.
[19:41.020 --> 19:48.020]  The ideal temperature is about 600 degrees C where you create these highly irregular surfaces.
[19:49.020 --> 19:53.020]  Lots of surface area that provide habitat for microbiology.
[19:54.020 --> 19:57.020]  The hotter it gets, you get these ordered sheets, you get graphene.
[19:58.020 --> 20:01.020]  On this end, you have these very irregular, they're called fullerene molecules.
[20:02.020 --> 20:04.020]  And we think that's one of the reasons why biochar is so stable.
[20:05.020 --> 20:10.020]  Because of the irregular orientation of the carbon rings themselves.
[20:11.020 --> 20:15.020]  Because the idea is to store carbon in soils.
[20:15.020 --> 20:18.020]  Like, dry it down and store it.
[20:19.020 --> 20:20.020]  And then do something useful with it.
[20:21.020 --> 20:24.020]  Designing the charcoal so it can be used for ag markets, right?
[20:25.020 --> 20:29.020]  But the first idea was just like this dry down carbon and store it in the ground.
[20:30.020 --> 20:32.020]  Not in an oil well, but on the surface.
[20:33.020 --> 20:37.020]  Well that's super cool that you're doing biochar. Thank you for doing that, man.
[20:38.020 --> 20:39.020]  If there's any way we could help you.
[20:40.020 --> 20:42.020]  Yeah, it was an experiment we did this year.
[20:42.020 --> 20:46.020]  The only thing I really found as a problem this year is our soil was hot.
[20:47.020 --> 20:49.020]  You're like a soil chef.
[20:50.020 --> 20:55.020]  So when you have a recipe, what are you thinking about as you build up a soil?
[20:56.020 --> 20:58.020]  You're like, okay, I need this to give it air.
[20:59.020 --> 21:01.020]  I need this for the microbes. I need this for that.
[21:02.020 --> 21:06.020]  What goes into creating a soil recipe?
[21:06.020 --> 21:09.020]  So it's the architecture of the soil to start with.
[21:10.020 --> 21:13.020]  The physics of the soil. Can it do what it needs to do?
[21:14.020 --> 21:16.020]  Then it's the chemistry, the combined chemistry and biology.
[21:17.020 --> 21:22.020]  Can you optimize both of those for efficient delivery of nutrients to plants?
[21:23.020 --> 21:25.020]  I actually have a question, David.
[21:26.020 --> 21:28.020]  Why did you leave perlite out from this mix?
[21:29.020 --> 21:32.020]  Because we feel like perlite in some ways is taking up space where a root should be.
[21:32.020 --> 21:34.020]  We don't really need perlite.
[21:35.020 --> 21:37.020]  I find it really helps with drainage.
[21:38.020 --> 21:41.020]  Getting that water to penetrate deep into the soil.
[21:42.020 --> 21:46.020]  Because we have the short and long fiber coco that really provides that.
[21:47.020 --> 21:48.020]  The air-filled porosity.
[21:49.020 --> 21:50.020]  You don't find it packs?
[21:51.020 --> 21:53.020]  No, we really don't.
[21:54.020 --> 21:57.020]  In fact, we would prefer people to use these than these.
[21:58.020 --> 22:01.020]  Just because this is a plant that's been around for a long time.
[22:02.020 --> 22:04.020]  Because it's a renewable resource.
[22:05.020 --> 22:07.020]  I understand the perlite thing.
[22:10.020 --> 22:14.020]  If you'd be interested, we'd be happy to support a trial.
[22:15.020 --> 22:17.020]  So we could show you how this actually works.
[22:18.020 --> 22:19.020]  If you'd be interested.
[22:20.020 --> 22:23.020]  Give me your card, we'll talk about it as soon as we get to plant.
[22:24.020 --> 22:26.020]  I actually have...
[22:26.020 --> 22:27.020]  What?
[22:31.020 --> 22:33.020]  240 pots that we haven't...
[22:34.020 --> 22:35.020]  240...
[22:36.020 --> 22:38.020]  260 gallon pots that we haven't filled yet.
[22:39.020 --> 22:41.020]  I haven't purchased dirt for.
[22:46.020 --> 22:48.020]  I have the hoop houses in place.
[22:49.020 --> 22:51.020]  I'm just stalled because I know my permit expires.
[22:52.020 --> 22:55.020]  I don't want to invest in soil if I have no permit.
[22:56.020 --> 22:58.020]  It's a good spot because before you could just do it.
[22:59.020 --> 23:00.020]  Because you're under the radar.
[23:01.020 --> 23:03.020]  Now that you've come out, you're not.
[23:04.020 --> 23:06.020]  It's absolutely killing me. It's making me regret it.
[23:07.020 --> 23:08.020]  I can imagine.
[23:09.020 --> 23:10.020]  You can't turn back the clock?
[23:11.020 --> 23:12.020]  You can't turn back the clock.
[23:15.020 --> 23:17.020]  My wife called me out for going legal.
[23:18.020 --> 23:19.020]  For doing it.
[23:20.020 --> 23:22.020]  She's like, it'll just be a nightmare. And she's right.
[23:23.020 --> 23:24.020]  She's absolutely right.
[23:24.020 --> 23:25.020]  Going legal.
[23:26.020 --> 23:27.020]  I love it. It's an awesome way.
[23:28.020 --> 23:29.020]  Oh yeah.
[23:30.020 --> 23:31.020]  She was just like...
[23:32.020 --> 23:33.020]  She saw the people in charge.
[23:34.020 --> 23:41.020]  She saw that we went through so much effort to get permitting and then I gave up.
[23:42.020 --> 23:43.020]  So you came from the traditional market?
[23:44.020 --> 23:46.020]  I've been doing this since 1986.
[23:47.020 --> 23:52.020]  So talk to me about strains from the past that you can't find anymore.
[23:53.020 --> 23:54.020]  Skunk one.
[23:56.020 --> 23:59.020]  True skunk one. The golf ball indica.
[24:00.020 --> 24:01.020]  Nobody has it anymore.
[24:05.020 --> 24:08.020]  That one. The original Mendo Purple.
[24:11.020 --> 24:12.020]  Golf ball indica.
[24:13.020 --> 24:14.020]  And who bred those?
[24:14.020 --> 24:15.020]  It's gone.
[24:16.020 --> 24:23.020]  You saw it coming out of Mendocino, Ukiah, that area.
[24:25.020 --> 24:26.020]  And it was just phenomenal.
[24:27.020 --> 24:29.020]  Just absolutely phenomenal.
[24:31.020 --> 24:32.020]  And it's gone.
[24:33.020 --> 24:35.020]  It disappeared in the early 90s. Both of those.
[24:36.020 --> 24:37.020]  Both of those did.
[24:38.020 --> 24:42.020]  The camp raids were more effective than people think they were.
[24:42.020 --> 24:49.020]  I mean, yeah, a lot of grows were left intact up there, but a lot of strains were lost. A lot.
[24:51.020 --> 24:53.020]  By just attrition or by...
[24:54.020 --> 24:55.020]  By both.
[24:56.020 --> 24:58.020]  By both. Crossbreeding the seeds.
[24:59.020 --> 25:04.020]  You know, pollination that people didn't really know where that pollen came from.
[25:08.020 --> 25:10.020]  We had some great sticky weeds.
[25:10.020 --> 25:11.020]  In the late 80s, early 90s.
[25:12.020 --> 25:14.020]  And where were you growing in the late 80s, early 90s?
[25:15.020 --> 25:16.020]  San Fernando Valley.
[25:18.020 --> 25:21.020]  So talk about the SFVOG.
[25:22.020 --> 25:28.020]  So I still have that strain. I've had it for 27 years, continuously cloned.
[25:29.020 --> 25:30.020]  But what's the history of it?
[25:31.020 --> 25:37.020]  So it actually came in through Point Lagoo Naval Air Station in a backpack.
[25:37.020 --> 25:40.020]  From those old Navy SEALs that were working in Afghanistan.
[25:41.020 --> 25:42.020]  That's where it came from.
[25:43.020 --> 25:44.020]  That's where it came from.
[25:45.020 --> 25:46.020]  And you got a cut.
[25:47.020 --> 25:48.020]  And I got a cut. I got a bag of seeds.
[25:49.020 --> 25:51.020]  You know, directly out of there.
[25:52.020 --> 25:56.020]  And what made that a standout cultivar?
[25:58.020 --> 26:01.020]  Purely a fact.
[26:02.020 --> 26:06.020]  It is the original, the original, the original.
[26:07.020 --> 26:08.020]  The original PK.
[26:09.020 --> 26:11.020]  So, SFVOG.
[26:12.020 --> 26:14.020]  It's original name was PK.
[26:15.020 --> 26:16.020]  The pure kush.
[26:18.020 --> 26:21.020]  And that is the original SFV.
[26:24.020 --> 26:27.020]  Was just a pain in the ass to grow.
[26:28.020 --> 26:29.020]  It was like an ivy plant.
[26:30.020 --> 26:31.020]  It went everywhere.
[26:32.020 --> 26:39.020]  It was just, compared to like your Northern California indica plants that were nice and uniform and bushy.
[26:40.020 --> 26:42.020]  And you know, grew up like this.
[26:43.020 --> 26:45.020]  This thing, you switched it into flower.
[26:46.020 --> 26:53.020]  It's initial stretch could be as much as 2 or 3 feet in 11, 12, 14 days.
[26:54.020 --> 26:58.020]  Maintaining a light height on those was just like, wow.
[26:59.020 --> 27:00.020]  You know.
[27:01.020 --> 27:02.020]  It was super hard.
[27:03.020 --> 27:09.020]  And your bud structure was nowhere as close together as the indicas out of Northern California.
[27:10.020 --> 27:16.020]  You know, it would be like a bud and then a blank spot for 8 or 9 inches and another bud.
[27:17.020 --> 27:20.020]  And then it was like an ivy plant just going everywhere.
[27:21.020 --> 27:29.020]  So getting that plant to respond properly and get a tight bud structure was just really, really a tough, tough play.
[27:30.020 --> 27:31.020]  You know, it still is.
[27:32.020 --> 27:33.020]  Oh yeah.
[27:34.020 --> 27:35.020]  What is your farm called?
[27:36.020 --> 27:41.020]  So Mr. Nice Guy LLC is our farm in Santa Barbara.
[27:42.020 --> 27:43.020]  It's licensed.
[27:43.020 --> 27:44.020]  From Half Baked?
[27:44.020 --> 27:45.020]  Yep.
[27:46.020 --> 27:48.020]  You need Dave Chappelle as a brand ambassador.
[27:49.020 --> 27:50.020]  Exactly. Exactly.
[27:52.020 --> 27:54.020]  But the soil building.
[27:55.020 --> 27:57.020]  I'm a fan of worms too.
[27:57.020 --> 27:59.020]  Release worms in your soil.
[28:00.020 --> 28:03.020]  But if you're growing in pots?
[28:04.020 --> 28:05.020]  Release worms in your soil.
[28:06.020 --> 28:07.020]  Into the pots.
[28:08.020 --> 28:10.020]  Both red worms and night crawlers.
[28:11.020 --> 28:13.020]  Night crawlers will go deep, red will stay on top.
[28:14.020 --> 28:15.020]  And they just...
[28:16.020 --> 28:22.020]  And in terms of like, are you constantly like, I think of kind of the moisture level in soil.
[28:22.020 --> 28:23.020]  Like you want to keep it in a bin.
[28:24.020 --> 28:26.020]  You don't want it to get super dry and then over water it.
[28:27.020 --> 28:29.020]  Like keep going, blowing past this.
[28:30.020 --> 28:31.020]  Like the bin that the microbes love.
[28:32.020 --> 28:33.020]  They don't want to live in a swamp.
[28:34.020 --> 28:35.020]  That's for sure. That's for sure.
[28:36.020 --> 28:40.020]  You know, so, you know, I don't water to run off.
[28:41.020 --> 28:42.020]  It's too wet.
[28:43.020 --> 28:44.020]  It's too much.
[28:45.020 --> 28:47.020]  But like we watered our pots.
[28:47.020 --> 28:54.020]  Every 10 or 14 days all through the off season just to keep the worms alive.
[28:55.020 --> 29:00.020]  You know, so the worms were doing their thing and breeding and growing and...
[29:01.020 --> 29:03.020]  So you're leaving the soil in those pots.
[29:04.020 --> 29:06.020]  And what are you doing to build the soil back up?
[29:07.020 --> 29:08.020]  Are you doing anything or just...
[29:09.020 --> 29:11.020]  Nope. We turned it and letting the worms go.
[29:12.020 --> 29:13.020]  Letting the worms do their thing.
[29:13.020 --> 29:18.020]  Like I said, this year because of the biochar, I think because of the biochar,
[29:19.020 --> 29:23.020]  the soil was a little bit hot deep in the soil.
[29:24.020 --> 29:25.020]  It's not because of the biochar.
[29:26.020 --> 29:29.020]  I think that, as I said, char needs to be activated.
[29:30.020 --> 29:31.020]  It takes a couple years.
[29:32.020 --> 29:36.020]  So I guarantee you that certainly next year you won't have that problem at all.
[29:37.020 --> 29:38.020]  We don't have any problem whatsoever.
[29:39.020 --> 29:41.020]  So, you know, it may be the worm castings that we've added in there.
[29:41.020 --> 29:42.020]  But the char should take care of that.
[29:43.020 --> 29:45.020]  We were just a little bit hot. We were hot.
[29:46.020 --> 29:47.020]  I understand that. We were hot.
[29:48.020 --> 29:50.020]  This has enough nutrients for six weeks in it. Right here.
[29:51.020 --> 29:54.020]  I mean, this should be hot, but it's not.
[29:55.020 --> 29:58.020]  So that was my one complaint.
[29:59.020 --> 30:02.020]  Well, one of my complaints was our soil was hot.
[30:03.020 --> 30:05.020]  I understand. Well, you don't want a hot soil.
[30:06.020 --> 30:07.020]  No. Definitely don't.
[30:07.020 --> 30:09.020]  That's inefficient.
[30:10.020 --> 30:12.020]  And it creates stress on the plants. It's unnecessary.
[30:13.020 --> 30:17.020]  So I'm looking forward to this year because I know it calmed down.
[30:18.020 --> 30:21.020]  And I know that live release of worms.
[30:22.020 --> 30:26.020]  How big of a granular was the char itself you got?
[30:27.020 --> 30:28.020]  Was it heterogeneous? Was it consistent?
[30:29.020 --> 30:32.020]  It was close. It was close to what we see here.
[30:33.020 --> 30:37.020]  Maybe a little bit thicker. A little bit coarser.
[30:38.020 --> 30:42.020]  You can see it. You can feel it as well.
[30:43.020 --> 30:46.020]  By the time we were mixed in, it was pretty awesome.
[30:47.020 --> 30:51.020]  We were mixing it old school style with a bucket loader.
[30:54.020 --> 30:57.020]  And just turning and turning and turning.
[30:58.020 --> 31:01.020]  I love the fact that you're using worms because you're using them.
[31:02.020 --> 31:03.020]  You're creating worm castings.
[31:04.020 --> 31:06.020]  So it's silly to have to buy them. It's ridiculous.
[31:09.020 --> 31:14.020]  We just bought worms and let them go and fed the hell out of them.
[31:15.020 --> 31:19.020]  And they do nothing but clean your roots and take care of the soil and give you love all in the soil.
[31:20.020 --> 31:24.020]  So it sounds like you've drank the Kool-Aid around biomedically natural soil systems.
[31:25.020 --> 31:26.020]  Yeah. Oh yeah.
[31:27.020 --> 31:29.020]  It totally makes sense. Why waste the money?
[31:29.020 --> 31:30.020]  Why waste the money?
[31:31.020 --> 31:33.020]  Plus you're really championing whole regenerative farming.
[31:34.020 --> 31:38.020]  And then you get all those little tunnels that the water can breeze down in.
[31:42.020 --> 31:43.020]  Win, win, win.
[31:44.020 --> 31:45.020]  Air filled porosity. Right?
[31:48.020 --> 31:50.020]  Well it's super exciting. I enjoyed the conversation.
[31:51.020 --> 31:52.020]  Thank you so much for doing what you're doing.
[31:53.020 --> 31:54.020]  Thank you. Thank you.
[31:54.020 --> 31:58.020]  Thank you. Thank you. And I'll give you a call and we'll figure out how to get some soil up there.
[32:00.020 --> 32:03.020]  We really see this as kind of a transition soil.
[32:04.020 --> 32:05.020]  Like farmers who are doing really…
[32:06.020 --> 32:08.020]  Do you have a situation where we can pick it up by the dump truck load?
[32:10.020 --> 32:13.020]  We don't. It's either in super sacks or in bags.
[32:14.020 --> 32:16.020]  Because it's made indoors, we don't like using dump trucks.
[32:17.020 --> 32:18.020]  I'll be honest with you. For pathogens.
[32:19.020 --> 32:21.020]  We just really want to make sure you get a clean soil.
[32:21.020 --> 32:23.020]  But we have four yard super sacks.
[32:25.020 --> 32:26.020]  And those can be in a dump truck.
[32:30.020 --> 32:33.020]  Yeah. I mean, that's just how we had soil delivered out there.
[32:34.020 --> 32:36.020]  Dump trucks came up. We mixed it.
[32:37.020 --> 32:40.020]  We actually mixed outside. I told you. Old school style. Bucket loaders.
[32:41.020 --> 32:44.020]  And did you see any pathogenic behavior later because of that?
[32:46.020 --> 32:48.020]  See, that's what we're trying to control for.
[32:49.020 --> 32:52.020]  So, it's hard outdoors. It's really hard.
[32:54.020 --> 32:57.020]  You know, I've had… I like indoors.
[32:58.020 --> 33:00.020]  I like the control of indoors. I prefer indoors.
[33:01.020 --> 33:03.020]  Controlled environment agriculture is…
[33:04.020 --> 33:05.020]  I like it.
[33:06.020 --> 33:07.020]  …is a huge, huge opportunity.
[33:08.020 --> 33:10.020]  I've been a fan. I've been at it for a long time.
[33:11.020 --> 33:13.020]  I'm really good at it. I understand the problems there.
[33:14.020 --> 33:16.020]  I'll be honest. This year we struggled.
[33:17.020 --> 33:19.020]  Outdoor, you know, a little bit. A little bit.
[33:20.020 --> 33:21.020]  You can go backwards, can't you?
[33:22.020 --> 33:23.020]  Yeah.
[33:23.020 --> 33:25.020]  I mean, even though you're legal, you can still pivot from…
[33:26.020 --> 33:29.020]  Oh, yeah. We're working on getting indoors permitted.
[33:30.020 --> 33:31.020]  We just haven't been successful yet.
[33:32.020 --> 33:34.020]  You know. And that's where I prefer to be.
[33:35.020 --> 33:39.020]  You know. It's just… I applied. I applied. I applied.
[33:39.020 --> 33:44.020]  So, I actually have a volatiles license out of King City.
[33:45.020 --> 33:47.020]  I have a distributor license out of King City.
[33:48.020 --> 33:51.020]  I have retail non-storefront license statewide out of King City.
[33:52.020 --> 33:53.020]  Where's King City?
[33:54.020 --> 33:56.020]  I got it two and a half hours north of Santa Barbara.
[33:57.020 --> 33:58.020]  Okay. So, it's up in…
[33:59.020 --> 34:00.020]  Yeah. Up there.
[34:01.020 --> 34:02.020]  By Bealbilton and stuff?
[34:03.020 --> 34:04.020]  Yeah. Further north.
[34:05.020 --> 34:08.020]  So, we'll use that as our processing district.
[34:09.020 --> 34:10.020]  Our distribution center.
[34:11.020 --> 34:15.020]  Our first big permitted grow came out of Santa Barbara.
[34:16.020 --> 34:18.020]  We're trying for permits in Santa Paula,
[34:20.020 --> 34:26.020]  San Fernando Valley for indoor operations.
[34:27.020 --> 34:29.020]  Are you part of any growing association?
[34:30.020 --> 34:33.020]  So, you know, I work with Justin a little bit.
[34:35.020 --> 34:36.020]  But, no.
[34:37.020 --> 34:38.020]  State independent.
[34:41.020 --> 34:45.020]  So, like Ryan Martinez who was the head grower for Jungle Boys.
[34:46.020 --> 34:47.020]  He was my best friend since 16.
[34:48.020 --> 34:49.020]  I had to laugh because I hadn't…
[34:50.020 --> 34:52.020]  This particular gentleman. It was funny.
[34:53.020 --> 34:54.020]  Just the way the world works.
[34:55.020 --> 35:00.020]  My wife and I are up at a show in northern California
[35:01.020 --> 35:02.020]  at the High Times event.
[35:03.020 --> 35:04.020]  We hit up the Jungle Boys tent.
[35:04.020 --> 35:08.020]  I don't give out A's very often when we're judging weed, right?
[35:09.020 --> 35:12.020]  So, we walk in and I'm standing there at the counter.
[35:13.020 --> 35:14.020]  I'm like, honey, check it out.
[35:15.020 --> 35:16.020]  That is an A+.
[35:17.020 --> 35:18.020]  And so is that. And so is that.
[35:19.020 --> 35:20.020]  She like looks at me in shock.
[35:21.020 --> 35:22.020]  She's like, what?
[35:23.020 --> 35:24.020]  Like, those three right…
[35:25.020 --> 35:26.020]  I get the hype, babe. Here.
[35:27.020 --> 35:28.020]  Those three right there are A+.
[35:29.020 --> 35:30.020]  That stuff over there is kind of a B.
[35:31.020 --> 35:32.020]  But these three right here, those are A+.
[35:32.020 --> 35:33.020]  Those are solid.
[35:34.020 --> 35:35.020]  Solid genetics right there.
[35:36.020 --> 35:40.020]  So, like, four months later, I'm in another conversation with a friend.
[35:41.020 --> 35:44.020]  And he's like, oh yeah, do you know who the head grower for Jungle Boys is?
[35:45.020 --> 35:46.020]  I'm like, no.
[35:47.020 --> 35:48.020]  I have no idea.
[35:49.020 --> 35:50.020]  He's like, it's Ryan Martinez.
[35:51.020 --> 35:52.020]  I just started laughing.
[35:53.020 --> 35:54.020]  I'm like, had to be one of five people I know.
[35:55.020 --> 35:56.020]  Had to be.
[35:57.020 --> 35:58.020]  That I grew up with.
[35:59.020 --> 36:00.020]  He was a big grower right here in Malibu.
[36:00.020 --> 36:03.020]  And he helped me develop my program back when we were 18 years old.
[36:04.020 --> 36:08.020]  We worked together, you know, like, you know, screwing up plants.
[36:09.020 --> 36:10.020]  Feeding them to death.
[36:11.020 --> 36:12.020]  Live and learn, right?
[36:13.020 --> 36:14.020]  This iteration.
[36:15.020 --> 36:16.020]  It was so funny.
[36:17.020 --> 36:22.020]  I just died of tears when it just was like, oh my God, what a small world.
[36:23.020 --> 36:24.020]  Called him up. I'm like, hey, dude.
[36:25.020 --> 36:27.020]  Like, Adam, what are you doing, man?
[36:28.020 --> 36:29.020]  You had lost touch with him?
[36:30.020 --> 36:32.020]  I had just, yeah, I had been in Montana growing for seven years.
[36:33.020 --> 36:37.020]  And, you know, he came up actually when I set up my program in Montana.
[36:38.020 --> 36:40.020]  You know, because he was my best friend.
[36:41.020 --> 36:45.020]  But we just had gone, gone our ways and doing our thing.
[36:46.020 --> 36:48.020]  And, you know, he got married and had a kid.
[36:49.020 --> 36:50.020]  And he was down here busy as hell.
[36:51.020 --> 36:52.020]  And I was up there just busy as hell.
[36:53.020 --> 36:54.020]  You know.
[36:55.020 --> 36:56.020]  Just living your life, right?
[36:57.020 --> 37:03.020]  And we just, you know, a few highs, but not any real communication, you know.
[37:04.020 --> 37:10.020]  And I just died of tears when I'm like, it had to be one of five people.
[37:11.020 --> 37:17.020]  It was either Ryan Martinez, Marshall Davis, Kelly Bellissimo, you know, who grew that.
[37:18.020 --> 37:19.020]  You know, like.
[37:20.020 --> 37:21.020]  Are Jungle Boys out of LA?
[37:22.020 --> 37:23.020]  Yeah.
[37:24.020 --> 37:25.020]  They're huge. They're huge out of LA.
[37:26.020 --> 37:32.020]  They've wanted me to come on board with them, but their culture isn't exactly my culture.
[37:34.020 --> 37:35.020]  So.
[37:36.020 --> 37:37.020]  They have a certain swagger.
[37:39.020 --> 37:42.020]  You know, where I'm more of a low-key, quiet farmer.
[37:43.020 --> 37:44.020]  Yeah.
[37:45.020 --> 37:46.020]  I don't play with anything white.
[37:47.020 --> 37:48.020]  Yeah.
[37:49.020 --> 37:50.020]  Yeah.
[37:51.020 --> 37:52.020]  I smoke weed.
[37:53.020 --> 37:54.020]  Yeah.
[37:56.020 --> 38:00.020]  What do you think of the emergence of the plant medicines as a viable life strategy?
[38:01.020 --> 38:04.020]  Like psilocybin and like, like, like.
[38:05.020 --> 38:08.020]  I'm excited to see the research, you know.
[38:09.020 --> 38:12.020]  So being in the medical industry for a long time.
[38:13.020 --> 38:17.020]  So I jumped into the medical industry, 2 feet 15 compliant.
[38:18.020 --> 38:22.020]  Right when it happened in California in 97.
[38:22.020 --> 38:24.020]  So DC Collective and.
[38:26.020 --> 38:33.020]  And a couple other collectives in the valley, you know, I worked with starting in 97.
[38:34.020 --> 38:44.020]  Then in 2006 when Montana went legal, that's where my family had moved to when I was 18.
[38:45.020 --> 38:47.020]  I was like, you know what, let's do Montana.
[38:48.020 --> 38:51.020]  So we went up there and for seven years, we were doing it.
[38:52.020 --> 38:55.020]  Seven years, eight years, we really worked hard up there.
[38:56.020 --> 39:08.020]  Montana was a unique opportunity because their, their issuances, medical cards were so restrictive that the people who got cards were truly sick.
[39:09.020 --> 39:19.020]  What you're doing in your agriculture practices, what we're championing is the tip of the regenerative egg spear that will influence the whole industry in the next 10 to 20 years.
[39:19.020 --> 39:27.020]  Yeah, it'll be. It's something that needs to happen because the draining of our water, the salting of our fields.
[39:28.020 --> 39:36.020]  And I mean, I suck because I'm a farmer and I understand salts and and it's easy and it's quick and it's an instant fix.
[39:38.020 --> 39:46.020]  And I get it from both sides, you know, that, yes, using them long term contaminates our soil.
[39:46.020 --> 40:00.020]  But I'm down to a quarter of what a normal farmer would do, you know, and I mean, I'm still I'm using alfalfa pellets and that's another thing I'm using in my soil.
[40:02.020 --> 40:07.020]  So, you know, I'm creating a rich soil of nutrient based solution.
[40:08.020 --> 40:10.020]  You want to see what's in our soil? Can I show you the peck?
[40:16.020 --> 40:17.020]  And.
