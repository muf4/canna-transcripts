[00:17.600 --> 00:23.600]  My name is Mel Frank. I'm author of the Marijuana Grows Guide, Marijuana Grows Insiders Guide.
[00:23.600 --> 00:26.600]  I'm the publisher of Rob Clark's book, Hashish.
[00:26.600 --> 00:29.600]  And I've been growing since 1968.
[00:29.600 --> 00:32.600]  First started in New York City in an apartment.
[00:32.600 --> 00:34.600]  Moved to California in 76.
[00:34.600 --> 00:38.600]  And have grown indoors, outdoors, greenhouses.
[00:38.600 --> 00:41.600]  A couple of times on some real scale.
[00:41.600 --> 00:45.600]  But most of the time pretty small stuff.
[00:45.600 --> 00:50.600]  I still breed, I still consult, I still write, I still photograph.
[00:50.600 --> 00:58.600]  I recently had this last year, I had two photo art shows.
[00:58.600 --> 01:01.600]  One at M&B Gallery here of archival marijuana photographs.
[01:01.600 --> 01:04.600]  And one in New York City at Ben Ruby Gallery.
[01:04.600 --> 01:06.600]  That was last fall.
[01:06.600 --> 01:08.600]  So currently I'm still doing that.
[01:08.600 --> 01:11.600]  Still breeding and do some consulting.
[01:11.600 --> 01:13.600]  My name is Kyle Castanon.
[01:13.600 --> 01:15.600]  The founder and grower of Palomar Craft Cannabis.
[01:15.600 --> 01:19.600]  Been growing in a two-car garage, started growing in a two-car garage back in 2009.
[01:19.600 --> 01:23.600]  And over the years I've scaled it up to a 32,000 square foot mixed light facility.
[01:23.600 --> 01:30.600]  And Mel and I are actually having some pretty good conversations about the industry and how it's been changing over the years.
[01:30.600 --> 01:36.600]  Some of the things that we were really talking about, it was just the skill sets that we've developed over the years as growers.
[01:36.600 --> 01:37.600]  Yes.
[01:37.600 --> 01:49.600]  And the thing we both agree on that's probably the biggest problem in the cultivation aspect of the industry is the lack of true master growers.
[01:49.600 --> 01:55.600]  That we just see too many grows fail because the master grower really isn't a master at growing.
[01:55.600 --> 02:01.600]  And that's something that should be changing because there's so much money involved in it, so much at stake in it.
[02:01.600 --> 02:11.600]  That I think more and more people who are growers will take what they're doing much more seriously in terms of the science, the technology that's available now.
[02:11.600 --> 02:19.600]  Because when you grow indoors or in a greenhouse, you need to control the environment as much as possible.
[02:19.600 --> 02:27.600]  Not only in the cleanliness aspect of it, but also in terms of humidity and of course the CO2, your fertilizers and everything else.
[02:27.600 --> 02:32.600]  It all has to be monitored. It has to be monitored consistently.
[02:32.600 --> 02:43.600]  And the grows that I've seen that are really successful are set up in a way that there are remote monitors in every room that are telling them what their humidity is,
[02:43.600 --> 02:50.600]  what the temperature is, so that it falls within a BDP range that's healthy for the plants.
[02:51.600 --> 03:00.600]  This way here you can avoid getting things like powdery mildew, so you never have to treat the plants with something before or after it happens.
[03:00.600 --> 03:04.600]  The days of Eagle 20 are gone.
[03:04.600 --> 03:14.600]  And so people have to learn how to grow clean crops without resorting to these things that were used in the past.
[03:15.600 --> 03:26.600]  We were just talking about some horror stories of these real estate developers, new interest in the industry coming in, hiring some guy from Colorado who says he's a master grower,
[03:26.600 --> 03:33.600]  dumping millions of dollars into a facility, installing the wrong technology, and just losing everything.
[03:33.600 --> 03:39.600]  And we're seeing that a lot in California over the last couple of years as legalization has happened, these regulations have been implemented.
[03:39.600 --> 03:41.600]  And it's just really heartbreaking.
[03:41.600 --> 03:48.600]  Some of the bad advice and just wrong advice that traditional agriculture people are giving to cannabis growers and saying,
[03:48.600 --> 03:54.600]  we would recommend one set of equipment, but say a guy who grows tomato or corn would say, oh, you don't need that.
[03:54.600 --> 03:56.600]  It's like it's a heat-tolerant plant.
[03:56.600 --> 03:59.600]  Well, how do you know it's a heat-tolerant plant? How many cannabis growers have you had?
[03:59.600 --> 04:08.600]  And so it's just a lot of bad advice, and a lot of people are just not valuing the skill sets that we've developed over the years at great risk,
[04:08.600 --> 04:11.600]  because they just think it's a plant.
[04:11.600 --> 04:18.600]  And it's really heartbreaking to see some of these just very simple mistakes that are costing people millions and millions of dollars.
[04:18.600 --> 04:24.600]  Also, the practices that a lot of growers had just aren't accepted in the industry anymore,
[04:24.600 --> 04:34.600]  simply because your product is going to be tested and has to be completely free of pesticides and fungicides and so forth, whereas before it wasn't.
[04:34.600 --> 04:39.600]  And so people just used whatever they could to finish a crop.
[04:39.600 --> 04:43.600]  And if they're living in a place that had a lot of humidity, a lot of cool temperatures,
[04:43.600 --> 04:49.600]  they were going to end up with powdery mildew or arthritis that they would treat with fungicides, and you just can't do that anymore.
[04:49.600 --> 04:57.600]  Yeah, one of the products you mentioned, Eagle 20, that was a very common fungicide to get rid of powdery mildew or bot or some of these other things,
[04:57.600 --> 04:59.600]  but that shows up on tests now.
[04:59.600 --> 05:04.600]  And even when you extract it, that can actually pass through the extraction process and go into your concentrates.
[05:04.600 --> 05:07.600]  And people are struggling with that as well.
[05:07.600 --> 05:13.600]  Yeah, in fact, people thought that they were clean of that because they would use a clone,
[05:13.600 --> 05:22.600]  a clone that came from a plant that had been treated with Eagle 20, but still it's systemic and it would end up, and it could still be detectable.
[05:22.600 --> 05:33.600]  The other thing I think that has really hurt the cultivators in terms of some of these big indoor and greenhouse grows is when they accept clones.
[05:33.600 --> 05:37.600]  Everybody is so interested in getting new genetics, better genetics, and so forth.
[05:38.600 --> 05:46.600]  They accept clones that they think are clean, and only to find out that they end up with rusted or broad mites, mites that are microscopic,
[05:46.600 --> 05:51.600]  and take a long time to discern that you actually have them until you see your plants failing.
[05:51.600 --> 05:55.600]  So I think that's something I've seen in the industry that's very common.
[05:55.600 --> 06:02.600]  Somebody brings in a clone from a trusted source, and that trusted source shouldn't have been trusted as much.
[06:03.600 --> 06:09.600]  So something else we were talking about, just as industry is changing, you've got indoor cultivation.
[06:09.600 --> 06:12.600]  For the first time, you can put up these high-tech greenhouses.
[06:12.600 --> 06:16.600]  Where do you think the industry is really going as far as the cultivation methods?
[06:16.600 --> 06:23.600]  Well, cultivation, I think for bulk, it'll probably be straight outdoors, although straight outdoors has its problems too.
[06:24.600 --> 06:29.600]  A lot of the areas that have been traditionally farmed, like in Carpentaria and places like this,
[06:29.600 --> 06:33.600]  the soil may have a lot of heavy metals in it.
[06:33.600 --> 06:40.600]  It may have contaminants from past growth from years ago that are still going to be drawn up, and they're going to be detected.
[06:40.600 --> 06:42.600]  I tend to agree.
[06:42.600 --> 06:47.600]  You see a lot of bulk coming out of the NorCal market, the Carpentaria, Santa Barbara.
[06:47.600 --> 06:49.600]  But it's going to be for extraction.
[06:49.600 --> 06:50.600]  Right.
[06:50.600 --> 06:51.600]  It's not going to be flowers.
[06:51.600 --> 06:55.600]  It is extraction, and that has its own sets of challenges too.
[06:55.600 --> 06:58.600]  If you do have heavy metals, that could pass off into concentrates as well.
[06:58.600 --> 07:00.600]  Yeah, it's gotten a lot harder.
[07:00.600 --> 07:07.600]  Something I've just been focusing on is just some of my friends who are trying to get legal and come into the industry.
[07:07.600 --> 07:11.600]  We're trying to help them do all their paperwork and get them licensed and everything.
[07:11.600 --> 07:17.600]  Because what they said, there's about 50,000 growers in the state of California in 2017, and now there's like 5,000.
[07:17.600 --> 07:20.600]  So what happens to the other 45,000?
[07:20.600 --> 07:22.600]  And they're not going to close up shop either.
[07:22.600 --> 07:25.600]  They're just pushing everything out the back door like they always have.
[07:25.600 --> 07:27.600]  But that undermines the whole system.
[07:27.600 --> 07:30.600]  We've got to help to change that.
[07:30.600 --> 07:33.600]  I think it will be interesting how this all flushes out.
[07:33.600 --> 07:46.600]  I think that there will always be a craft industry for flowers, but flowers are probably going to become less and less a part of the industry as more and more goes into the concentrates.
[07:47.600 --> 07:53.600]  I think California will probably be one of the last places where the use of flowers diminishes.
[07:53.600 --> 07:59.600]  Because we just have a long history of it, and that's the way it's been consumed for so many years.
[07:59.600 --> 08:02.600]  I know personally, I still like to smoke a good joint.
[08:02.600 --> 08:04.600]  It's one of the best things to do.
[08:04.600 --> 08:08.600]  That and maybe a rosin hit is nice.
[08:08.600 --> 08:10.600]  You also get the whole plant there.
[08:10.600 --> 08:13.600]  But I was never big on concentrates.
[08:14.600 --> 08:24.600]  I mean, other than the fact that they're really strong, you know, they'd just be missing the whole plant feeling that you get when you have all those different terpenes in with your smoke.
[08:24.600 --> 08:27.600]  See, that was my problem with vape pens and everything like that.
[08:27.600 --> 08:32.600]  There's some really good vape pens out there, and sure, the flavors are great, but it felt like such a one-dimensional high.
[08:32.600 --> 08:37.600]  I mean, you smoke it, you get high, like really high for like 10 minutes, and then it's gone.
[08:38.600 --> 08:44.600]  Where some of the organically grown, the sun-grown stuff that I get to smoke every now and then, it's beautiful.
[08:44.600 --> 08:49.600]  You're high for like two or three hours, but you're not overly like, oh my god, I'm going to die high.
[08:51.600 --> 08:55.600]  I think the extraction still has a ways to go in some cases, but the rosin, oh man.
[08:55.600 --> 08:57.600]  Definitely does, yeah.
[08:57.600 --> 09:04.600]  Well, with the extraction, you're basically putting in your terpenes that are coming from other sources, right?
[09:04.600 --> 09:06.600]  They're coming from lemons, your lemonade.
[09:06.600 --> 09:15.600]  They're just putting it in, so when you're smoking that in a vape pen, you get a strong flavor, but it's really artificial.
[09:15.600 --> 09:20.600]  Because they can't put in the 30 or 50 or how many terpenes there actually are.
[09:20.600 --> 09:25.600]  Many of them are there in minuscule amounts, so they put in the most prominent.
[09:25.600 --> 09:31.600]  There's four or five of those terpenes they might put in to try to match the terpene profile they get back from the lab.
[09:32.600 --> 09:40.600]  It works in terms of you get some flavor, but you still don't get the same effect that you would if you were smoking the flower it came from.
[09:40.600 --> 09:41.600]  Yeah, I agree.
[09:41.600 --> 09:48.600]  Once they extract it into that matrix that the plant has evolved into, it just cheapens the high.
[09:48.600 --> 09:54.600]  We grow one string called Saturn OG, and it's really mild, but it'll last for three or four hours.
[09:55.600 --> 10:01.600]  You try extracting that with a BHO or even rosin, the rosin actually gets the closest thing, I think.
[10:01.600 --> 10:05.600]  They're only using heat and pressure for that as opposed to a solvent.
[10:05.600 --> 10:08.600]  I think it's just beautiful, but you're right.
[10:08.600 --> 10:14.600]  We're seeing over the years, extracts are taking more and more of the shelf space for ease of use.
[10:14.600 --> 10:16.600]  Who doesn't like a vape pen?
[10:16.600 --> 10:18.600]  You can smoke at a bar and things like that.
[10:18.600 --> 10:20.600]  I think they're cool.
[10:20.600 --> 10:27.600]  If you really want to taste the plant and the craft that went into it, the whole flower is the way to go.
[10:27.600 --> 10:31.600]  You think over time, less and less flower will actually be consumed.
[10:31.600 --> 10:34.600]  Yeah, I think it'll always be that craft industry, just like beer.
[10:34.600 --> 10:39.600]  You have Budweiser, then you have all sorts of little craft ones, local ones.
[10:39.600 --> 10:42.600]  It's funny you mentioned how long it lasted.
[10:43.600 --> 10:51.600]  Back in the day, in the 70s, when I was breeding, I produced Afghani-1 and Durban poison for the industry.
[10:51.600 --> 10:53.600]  It was one of my claims to fame.
[10:53.600 --> 10:58.600]  I would give out nimber joints to people to smoke and have them report back to me.
[10:58.600 --> 11:03.600]  One of the things I always told them, always try to do your comparisons at the same time.
[11:03.600 --> 11:07.600]  If you smoke at night, 8 o'clock at night, always do it at that time.
[11:07.600 --> 11:10.600]  Then tell me how long it lasts.
[11:10.600 --> 11:14.600]  How long it lasted, to me, was the best indication of how strong it was.
[11:14.600 --> 11:15.600]  Really.
[11:15.600 --> 11:16.600]  That's funny.
[11:16.600 --> 11:18.600]  I think it's probably stronger than you think.
[11:18.600 --> 11:22.600]  The Saturn OG that I have was an Afghani cross, so thank you.
[11:22.600 --> 11:24.600]  Could have done it without you.
[11:27.600 --> 11:31.600]  Some of the things we were talking about, too, was all these new entrants to the market.
[11:31.600 --> 11:33.600]  One of the first panels was talking about the mergers and acquisitions.
[11:33.600 --> 11:35.600]  There's a lot of money coming in.
[11:35.600 --> 11:38.600]  As someone who pioneered the industry, how does that make you feel?
[11:38.600 --> 11:45.600]  You've got these guys who are two years into the industry, and all of a sudden, these multi-million dollar valuations.
[11:45.600 --> 11:47.600]  I don't know about you, but that kind of pisses me off.
[11:47.600 --> 11:49.600]  It does me, too.
[11:49.600 --> 11:55.600]  I see people come in who have money and are able to make more money because they have money.
[11:55.600 --> 11:57.600]  They don't have the skill set or anything else.
[11:57.600 --> 12:01.600]  Unfortunately, that's the way capitalism works.
[12:01.600 --> 12:03.600]  Like it or love it, I guess.
[12:03.600 --> 12:07.600]  Fortunately, we all can still grow our own marijuana.
[12:08.600 --> 12:11.600]  Seeds and that will always be part of the industry.
[12:11.600 --> 12:17.600]  What hasn't been adopted here is really the auto flowers.
[12:17.600 --> 12:19.600]  Like they are in Europe.
[12:19.600 --> 12:21.600]  It's the biggest seller in Europe are the auto flowers.
[12:21.600 --> 12:23.600]  That and then feminized seeds.
[12:23.600 --> 12:26.600]  But here, not so much.
[12:26.600 --> 12:27.600]  I'll be honest.
[12:27.600 --> 12:30.600]  I've been growing for 10 years, and I've never grown auto flower.
[12:30.600 --> 12:34.600]  It didn't really fit into my production system, I guess.
[12:35.600 --> 12:40.600]  As far as California goes, Southern California cultivation guys, we just don't do them.
[12:40.600 --> 12:42.600]  Why do you think that is?
[12:42.600 --> 12:48.600]  For one thing, we don't worry about the length of the season as much as they do in other parts of the country.
[12:48.600 --> 12:52.600]  I can still grow Colombian in my backyard here in Los Angeles.
[12:52.600 --> 12:53.600]  Really?
[12:53.600 --> 12:55.600]  Most of the country, you can't do that.
[12:55.600 --> 12:59.600]  Only because it's still flowering in November, December.
[13:00.600 --> 13:04.600]  Auto flowers, I don't have much experience with them.
[13:04.600 --> 13:10.600]  I did grow auto flower because I wanted to learn a little bit about its genetics.
[13:10.600 --> 13:18.600]  What I did is I crossed it with a male auto flower with six different varieties that I had.
[13:18.600 --> 13:20.600]  Then I knew how strong they were.
[13:20.600 --> 13:22.600]  I tested.
[13:22.600 --> 13:28.600]  The one that I had tested was a Pakistani that had tested at about 17% THC.
[13:29.600 --> 13:37.600]  When I crossed it with the auto flower and I had it tested, it came out to 8.5% THC, exactly one half of what the original was.
[13:37.600 --> 13:43.600]  That's because the auto flower doesn't contribute anything to it, or at least the auto flower I have.
[13:43.600 --> 13:51.600]  It only had one THC synthase versus the two it had when it was a Pakistani.
[13:51.600 --> 13:54.600]  That's how it came out to half of what it was.
[13:54.600 --> 13:57.600]  It may have been a coincidence, but it seemed to make sense to me.
[13:58.600 --> 14:00.600]  I wonder another reason why we never just got into them too.
[14:00.600 --> 14:03.600]  In Southern California, everything's indoors.
[14:03.600 --> 14:06.600]  The bulk of my career was all indoor cultivation.
[14:06.600 --> 14:13.600]  Only when it was fully legalized under Prop 64, it's like, okay, I'll drop a few million dollars into actually building a real facility with sensors.
[14:13.600 --> 14:19.600]  Prior to that, I had my metric where it's like, okay, I have to spend $3,000 a light.
[14:19.600 --> 14:23.600]  That's for all my ACs, my lights, the rent, until you get to the first harvest.
[14:23.600 --> 14:27.600]  You have to do it as cheaply as possible so you can make all your money back in about six months.
[14:27.600 --> 14:31.600]  Six months is about the average length of time that a police investigation takes before they raid you.
[14:31.600 --> 14:34.600]  That's how I used to set up all my old indoor grows.
[14:34.600 --> 14:38.600]  Now, for the first time ever, we're all licensed and permitted and everything.
[14:38.600 --> 14:42.600]  It's like, okay, wait, we have a return on investment.
[14:42.600 --> 14:44.600]  We can actually forecast.
[14:44.600 --> 14:51.600]  It's like we're going to put these really high-tech sensors and data logging things in front of sensors for the first time ever.
[14:51.600 --> 14:55.600]  We're not worried about getting the door kicked down in six months.
[14:55.600 --> 14:58.600]  That's been really exciting for me personally.
[14:58.600 --> 15:03.600]  I started in my garage and always wondering if I'm going to get my door kicked down, which we have.
[15:03.600 --> 15:05.600]  That was fun.
[15:05.600 --> 15:08.600]  13,000 square foot indoor space.
[15:08.600 --> 15:12.600]  Gone in a span of eight hours, like two years in there.
[15:12.600 --> 15:14.600]  Now, you finally can.
[15:14.600 --> 15:17.600]  I think that's going to be great for our industry too.
[15:17.600 --> 15:22.600]  I think the indoor cultivation definitely has a place in the market for small craft producers.
[15:22.600 --> 15:27.600]  I've seen just amazing flower grown by really, really high skill-set of guys.
[15:27.600 --> 15:32.600]  I think it's going to be important too for just environmental and regulatory purposes.
[15:32.600 --> 15:38.600]  The mixed light greenhouses are going to be a big thing with all the new carbon taxes that they're starting to hit on the indoor guys.
[15:38.600 --> 15:39.600]  I agree.
[15:39.600 --> 15:45.600]  The idea of using all artificial light to grow your plants is just such an expense.
[15:45.600 --> 15:47.600]  It really is.
[15:47.600 --> 15:49.600]  A lot of wattage.
[15:49.600 --> 15:52.600]  The water problem indoors is not really a problem.
[15:52.600 --> 15:55.600]  You should be able to recycle almost all of your water.
[15:55.600 --> 15:56.600]  That's no problem.
[15:56.600 --> 16:01.600]  You just collect it off your HVACs or your dehumidifiers and it has nowhere to go.
[16:01.600 --> 16:03.600]  You're in a sealed system.
[16:03.600 --> 16:08.600]  I think there's a lot of misinformation on the cultivation side, especially with the cities and the state.
[16:08.600 --> 16:10.600]  You remember a few years ago when we were in that drought?
[16:10.600 --> 16:15.600]  Our news articles were saying, it takes six gallons of plant every day for a cannabis.
[16:15.600 --> 16:16.600]  No, it doesn't.
[16:16.600 --> 16:23.600]  That's caused a string of problems with the regulatory agencies in the cities and saying, you have to recollect and reuse all your water.
[16:23.600 --> 16:29.600]  I'm going to save about 5% of my water usage, but I'm going to up my filter usage by about 100 times.
[16:29.600 --> 16:37.600]  I'm going to save a bunch of water, but it would generate a ton of waste with all the filters that we're using to recapture all this water that you're so worried about.
[16:38.600 --> 16:41.600]  Getting them to understand all that has been really a challenge for me.
[16:41.600 --> 16:47.600]  As we've been working through all these regulations that seem to change at a dime, right in the middle of things.
[16:47.600 --> 16:54.600]  Now, does that make you feel like now you're coming from your first book was published in 1974, here we are in 2019.
[16:54.600 --> 16:56.600]  Did you ever think this would actually happen?
[16:56.600 --> 17:02.600]  Actually, in the 70s, I thought it would be legal by 1980.
[17:02.600 --> 17:03.600]  Really?
[17:04.600 --> 17:15.600]  Well, the problem, you see, you had most of the more enlightened municipalities or states were starting to decriminalize it.
[17:15.600 --> 17:17.600]  All right, make the penalties a lot less.
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.600]  You had Carter in the White House who seemed sympathetic.
[17:22.600 --> 17:30.600]  You also had the first U.S. report come out, or recent report, the SAFR commission.
[17:30.600 --> 17:33.600]  They basically recommended that it be decriminalized.
[17:33.600 --> 17:36.600]  They said that decriminalizing it caused more harm than good.
[17:36.600 --> 17:43.600]  Unfortunately, Nixon said, F you, and just threw out that, paid no attention to it, and created the DEA.
[17:43.600 --> 17:45.600]  That's really what happened.
[17:45.600 --> 17:47.600]  That was when the war on drugs really started.
[17:47.600 --> 17:53.600]  By 1980, you had Rockefeller come in with the determinate sentences on drugs, which changed everything.
[17:54.600 --> 18:02.600]  Reagan came in, and then you started to have programs like CAMP.
[18:02.600 --> 18:08.600]  That was a California program of helicopters flying over the countryside to find marijuana.
[18:08.600 --> 18:10.600]  That's when indoor cultivation really started.
[18:10.600 --> 18:14.600]  It really started to push the indoor cultivation, absolutely.
[18:15.600 --> 18:19.600]  Then you also had Operation Green Merchant in the 80s.
[18:19.600 --> 18:25.600]  That started the whole round of them just coming and not arresting you, but just taking all your shit.
[18:25.600 --> 18:27.600]  I mean, really.
[18:27.600 --> 18:28.600]  They've been there.
[18:28.600 --> 18:29.600]  It was some tough times.
[18:29.600 --> 18:30.600]  It was some tough times then.
[18:30.600 --> 18:35.600]  I thought we should mention something about our experiences with lights.
[18:35.600 --> 18:39.600]  These people want to grow their own pot.
[18:40.600 --> 18:44.600]  My experience is you can grow it with pretty much any light.
[18:44.600 --> 18:46.600]  Some lights are better than other lights.
[18:46.600 --> 18:50.600]  The more recent ones, like the ceramics.
[18:50.600 --> 18:56.600]  I've grown with a little 315 ceramic, and it's amazing how much you can get from that one little light.
[18:56.600 --> 18:58.600]  You were saying that you're trying some 600s now?
[18:58.600 --> 18:59.600]  Oh, yeah.
[18:59.600 --> 19:01.600]  Light emitting ceramics is a new thing.
[19:01.600 --> 19:04.600]  Everyone knows about the LEDs, the light emitting diodes.
[19:05.600 --> 19:11.600]  As a guy who loves doing R&D projects and side-by-sides with it, I never really got the LEDs to work, especially in flowering.
[19:11.600 --> 19:14.600]  But the light emitting ceramics, for veg, absolutely.
[19:14.600 --> 19:17.600]  100% embrace that technology.
[19:17.600 --> 19:20.600]  I mean, we were using 600 watts metal highlights.
[19:20.600 --> 19:25.600]  We swiped them out one for one with a 315 watt, those light emitting ceramics, and it was great.
[19:25.600 --> 19:27.600]  It actually worked a bit better.
[19:27.600 --> 19:28.600]  It's a great industry.
[19:28.600 --> 19:37.600]  I'm hoping some of the technology will catch up where indoor cultivation actually could be economically viable for a lot of guys.
[19:37.600 --> 19:40.600]  Because in other states, too, they're only allowing that.
[19:40.600 --> 19:45.600]  I think Massachusetts is like that to an extent, where most of the cultivation is all indoor.
[19:45.600 --> 19:47.600]  It's probably not that good for the environment.
[19:47.600 --> 19:49.600]  We're using about 100 watts a square foot.
[19:51.600 --> 19:54.600]  But I think some of the LED stuff and the LACs could help get there.
[19:54.600 --> 20:03.600]  At the end of the day, I think the big production is going to be into mixed light greenhouses like mine, and people are going to be more and more comfortable investing in that infrastructure.
[20:03.600 --> 20:08.600]  Especially as you scale up, you have to invest more per square foot in that infrastructure to actually keep you climatized.
[20:08.600 --> 20:12.600]  What we talked about earlier, it's just like you have to have a stable climate first.
[20:14.600 --> 20:19.600]  I think the LEDs will be a big part of the industry, even in flowering.
[20:19.600 --> 20:21.600]  You said you actually got them to work, right?
[20:21.600 --> 20:22.600]  I've never been able to do that.
[20:22.600 --> 20:23.600]  I suck at LEDs.
[20:24.600 --> 20:33.600]  Greenhouses with supplemental lighting, I think, are really where it's going to be in terms of the industry.
[20:33.600 --> 20:40.600]  Because if you have a greenhouse and just rely on your natural crop, you're getting one crop, maybe two crops.
[20:40.600 --> 20:49.600]  But you can push it and get maybe three to five crops a year easy in a greenhouse if you have supplemental lighting and darkening.
[20:49.600 --> 20:52.600]  That's basically what you guys do, right?
[20:52.600 --> 20:53.600]  Yeah, pretty much.
[20:54.600 --> 20:58.600]  This goes back to earlier conversation of these master growers.
[20:58.600 --> 21:02.600]  You need to design a cultivation system first, and then you design your facility around that.
[21:02.600 --> 21:05.600]  We grow in organic soil, and we have a four-week veg time.
[21:05.600 --> 21:09.600]  Two weeks in a one gallon, two weeks in a five, eight to nine weeks in flowering, give or take.
[21:09.600 --> 21:17.600]  We have four compartmentalized flowering zones, and we get five harvests a year per zone.
[21:17.600 --> 21:22.600]  For us, we're going to get about 20 harvests this year, about every 18 days or so, just like clockwork.
[21:22.600 --> 21:27.600]  That's hard for a lot of guys, understanding project management and scheduling and things like that.
[21:27.600 --> 21:31.600]  You have to sync that with your drying and your manicuring and all that.
[21:31.600 --> 21:34.600]  It all has to be figured out in terms of that timing.
[21:34.600 --> 21:36.600]  Right, or otherwise you're going to be really unbalanced.
[21:36.600 --> 21:43.600]  I can't tell you a main reason why a lot of these guys are failing right now is, one, because they hire someone from whoever, Colorado,
[21:43.600 --> 21:46.600]  and there's a master grower, and they put together a system they think works.
[21:46.600 --> 21:50.600]  Once they actually start really running the thing, it's like, oh crap, our drying room's not big enough.
[21:50.600 --> 21:54.600]  Well, now we've got to do that. Now we've got to pull permits and do this, fix this, and run electricity.
[21:54.600 --> 21:57.600]  It's like, oh crap, this isn't big enough, or this is too big.
[21:57.600 --> 22:01.600]  Now we have a lot of wasted space where you could have thousands of square feet just line follow.
[22:01.600 --> 22:05.600]  It's like, well, that's not making any money for you, and now you've got to pay the taxes on that,
[22:05.600 --> 22:09.600]  because that's how much square feet is a canopy that you have, and that city is going to want your tax money.
[22:09.600 --> 22:13.600]  I think that's a really big problem is people don't understand that.
[22:13.600 --> 22:19.600]  They just go in, they acquire land, they build a facility, and then they try to shove a cultivation system into that.
[22:19.600 --> 22:25.600]  Now it's really unbalanced, and that just leads to a lot of losses and decreases in efficiencies.
[22:25.600 --> 22:28.600]  I think we've seen it both.
[22:28.600 --> 22:34.600]  I see a lot of problems with guys who don't understand that and don't value those skills.
[22:34.600 --> 22:39.600]  I've had guys tell me who are willing to write me a check, like, well, your skills don't really matter.
[22:39.600 --> 22:42.600]  We'll just get some Dutch guy in there. It's like, no.
[22:42.600 --> 22:43.600]  Absolutely.
[22:43.600 --> 22:50.600]  Yeah, so that's really disheartening, but then always in the end, it's like, those guys are failing right now.
[22:50.600 --> 22:53.600]  You know, mentioning the Dutch just reminded me of something funny.
[22:53.600 --> 22:56.600]  This was just maybe about eight months ago.
[22:56.600 --> 23:06.600]  I got a DM through my Instagram account from a guy in the Netherlands, in Amsterdam, actually.
[23:07.600 --> 23:13.600]  He asked me if I knew anybody, any master grower who were willing to come to Amsterdam and grow for him.
[23:13.600 --> 23:17.600]  He had the facility, and I wrote back saying, what do you mean? You're in Amsterdam.
[23:17.600 --> 23:19.600]  You should have, like, tons of them.
[23:19.600 --> 23:21.600]  He said, no, they all went back to California.
[23:21.600 --> 23:25.600]  Nice weather out here.
[23:25.600 --> 23:29.600]  Is anybody in the audience have any questions or anything?
[23:29.600 --> 23:32.600]  Cultivation questions, licensing questions?
[23:32.600 --> 23:33.600]  Sure.
[23:33.600 --> 23:39.600]  The question was about automation, increasing efficiencies through robotics and reducing your labor costs.
[23:39.600 --> 23:41.600]  Yeah, I think that's really important.
[23:41.600 --> 23:50.600]  I mean, as we get taxed more and heavily more regulated and things like that, we're looking, like, guys like us are looking for any way to reduce those costs when you're at scale.
[23:50.600 --> 23:53.600]  I mean, for us right now, our biggest cost is labor.
[23:53.600 --> 23:59.600]  It accounts about for 55% of the cost to produce one pound or one plant, pound, plant, whatever you want to call it.
[24:00.600 --> 24:06.600]  Especially depending on what state or municipality you're in, there could be a lot of labor shortages and things like that.
[24:06.600 --> 24:09.600]  So, I mean, I'm out in the middle of nowhere right now, and staffing can be a challenge.
[24:09.600 --> 24:12.600]  So it would be great if I could have some more automation.
[24:12.600 --> 24:15.600]  And so we're definitely putting a lot of that stuff in place.
[24:15.600 --> 24:19.600]  We're looking to Big Ag for some of their technology, like moving benches is one.
[24:19.600 --> 24:21.600]  The Dutch are the other guys.
[24:21.600 --> 24:22.600]  Yeah, the sliding benches.
[24:22.600 --> 24:26.600]  We've got rolling benches that go side to side, but now I need a bench that goes front to back.
[24:26.600 --> 24:28.600]  Because my greenhouse is about 100 feet long.
[24:28.600 --> 24:32.600]  That's a heck of a trek when you're, like, trying to move plants up and down it all day.
[24:32.600 --> 24:35.600]  What about trimming? Do you use automatic trimming?
[24:35.600 --> 24:37.600]  Mm-hmm. We do a little light trimming.
[24:37.600 --> 24:40.600]  Well, because that kind of goes back to a balanced system, too.
[24:40.600 --> 24:47.600]  You know, if we have, like, a 20,000 square feet of canopy, you know, we're harvesting about a little over 2,000 plants every 18 days.
[24:47.600 --> 24:52.600]  And with that kind of – and there's still a degree of seasonality in our greenhouses, too.
[24:52.600 --> 24:54.600]  I mean, the sun's really weak right now.
[24:54.600 --> 24:58.600]  So, you know, we need staff up and staff down throughout the season.
[24:58.600 --> 25:03.600]  But if we were to hand trim everything, we would need 70 full-time trimmers.
[25:03.600 --> 25:10.600]  And what happens if I'm two days, you know, ahead of schedule and I've got 70 trimmers, like, hey, I'm, like, sorry, you're going to take the next couple days off.
[25:10.600 --> 25:12.600]  That would piss them off.
[25:12.600 --> 25:19.600]  So we use a light – a little bit of automation when it comes to our trimming to have about a full-time workforce of about 20 full-time guys.
[25:19.600 --> 25:22.600]  But, I mean, they get better at their job.
[25:22.600 --> 25:23.600]  I'm able to cross-train them.
[25:23.600 --> 25:28.600]  So now they also know a little bit about trimming, about processing, the packaging, cultivation.
[25:28.600 --> 25:29.600]  And they like that.
[25:29.600 --> 25:37.600]  And so a lot of my entry-level guys and some of the guys who are kind of new, they get to see every part of the company because we can move them around because we are using some of that automation.
[25:37.600 --> 25:39.600]  So they're more bought in.
[25:39.600 --> 25:44.600]  You know, we get to see who's going to be a good performer instead of just having a headcount of, like, 50, 70 people.
[25:44.600 --> 25:46.600]  And that's all they're doing.
[25:46.600 --> 25:51.600]  And so we are able to reduce our turnover rate because of that as well just by implementing some of those automations.
[25:51.600 --> 25:52.600]  And I think that's important.
[25:52.600 --> 26:01.600]  If you're not – and I think a lot of our peers in the industry are still kind of stuck in that mindset of, well, this is how it's done for 20 years.
[26:01.600 --> 26:02.600]  We have to hand-trim it.
[26:02.600 --> 26:03.600]  We're going to do this.
[26:03.600 --> 26:04.600]  We're going to hand-water it.
[26:04.600 --> 26:07.600]  And it's like, yeah, that works great at a craft level if they want to stay small.
[26:07.600 --> 26:09.600]  It works great when it's illegal also.
[26:09.600 --> 26:11.600]  Yeah, exactly, when you don't have to pay payroll tax.
[26:11.600 --> 26:14.600]  There's a workers' comp and all this other great stuff.
[26:15.600 --> 26:27.600]  But it definitely has to be a part of the new world that we – the new regulated world that we live in because those are just sacrifices you have to make to not get your door kicked down or guys drop in from Black Hawk helicopters on your head.
[26:27.600 --> 26:30.600]  Like these are just things that we're all going to have to accept.
[26:30.600 --> 26:34.600]  And we've embraced a lot of that stuff because we're not trying to get rid of jobs.
[26:34.600 --> 26:36.600]  We're trying to make the jobs we have better.
[26:36.600 --> 26:40.600]  And I want to pay the one guy who's running those systems a lot more money.
[26:40.600 --> 26:47.600]  I want to give him more opportunities because we can expand the company that way instead of having dozens of minimum wage employees.
[26:47.600 --> 26:50.600]  Let's have a bunch of salaried guys who are actually making money, good benefits.
[26:50.600 --> 26:52.600]  And for my company, that's really important.
[26:52.600 --> 26:54.600]  I mean there's only two things in my company.
[26:54.600 --> 26:55.600]  It's people and plants.
[26:55.600 --> 26:56.600]  That's it.
[26:56.600 --> 26:57.600]  You have good people.
[26:57.600 --> 26:58.600]  They grow good plants.
[26:58.600 --> 27:00.600]  The plants produce good weed, sell some good – make good money.
[27:00.600 --> 27:01.600]  It's right back to the people.
[27:01.600 --> 27:02.600]  That's it.
[27:02.600 --> 27:08.600]  So, yeah, we do use a lot of that stuff just to balance the system and make better jobs for everybody.
[27:09.600 --> 27:15.600]  Why are some of the automation technologies that you're most excited to play around with?
[27:15.600 --> 27:17.600]  For example, I've used Blue Mat.
[27:17.600 --> 27:20.600]  What kind of irrigation?
[27:20.600 --> 27:24.600]  We're really excited about, yes, a fertigation system called Rhythm that we're just having installed.
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.600]  And so that can really just dial in some of our systems further.
[27:28.600 --> 27:32.600]  So we can actually see how dry the plant is and what that time –
[27:32.600 --> 27:34.600]  like, okay, here's when I watered first.
[27:34.600 --> 27:35.600]  This is my dryback time.
[27:35.600 --> 27:40.600]  And the system will know exactly, based on the parameters we set in it, when to water it again.
[27:40.600 --> 27:42.600]  And some other data that we collect, okay, what's that runoff look like?
[27:42.600 --> 27:44.600]  What's the tissue analysis of the plant look like?
[27:44.600 --> 27:48.600]  What's the soil holding what's still inside there?
[27:48.600 --> 27:52.600]  And so we can kind of go back and program and dial in these strains even further.
[27:52.600 --> 27:56.600]  So, like, we've developed a regimented system where we know the genetics of the strains.
[27:56.600 --> 28:01.600]  Like my Saturn OG is an Afghani cross, and so I want to borrow that.
[28:02.600 --> 28:06.600]  And we can actually optimize the system faster because we have that good data set of collection.
[28:06.600 --> 28:12.600]  We know it's like, okay, this Afghani likes this kind of fertilizer blend or this little bit of soil difference.
[28:12.600 --> 28:16.600]  And if we find another strain that might have another Afghani cross, it's like, okay, well,
[28:16.600 --> 28:21.600]  we've already got a baseline for that genetic, so we can optimize it faster by doing that.
[28:21.600 --> 28:23.600]  But I'm really excited about that.
[28:23.600 --> 28:27.600]  You know, the environmental control systems like Link4, we're working with them pretty closely.
[28:28.600 --> 28:34.600]  I love it and I hate it when some of these companies say, no one's ever asked us that before.
[28:34.600 --> 28:38.600]  And so that must mean I have a new idea that might be cool.
[28:38.600 --> 28:40.600]  But then it's a pain in the ass to actually implement it.
[28:40.600 --> 28:45.600]  So I'm really excited with kind of the data collection and now we've hooked up a lot of those servers
[28:45.600 --> 28:50.600]  and sensors to a SQL server database, and we can actually pull all the data out of that
[28:50.600 --> 28:52.600]  and mash it up with, like, these data visualization software.
[28:52.600 --> 29:01.600]  Yeah, I think the thrust of it is data, is that collecting more and more data about how much water they're using
[29:01.600 --> 29:09.600]  and so forth and really getting it down to a very fine art is really when you get the most production, right?
[29:09.600 --> 29:11.600]  The cleanest production also.
[29:11.600 --> 29:13.600]  And it's repeatability, too.
[29:13.600 --> 29:14.600]  I think that's...
[29:14.600 --> 29:15.600]  Yeah.
[29:15.600 --> 29:18.600]  The question was, are we using data to, you know,
[29:18.600 --> 29:21.600]  day-driven decisions on what strains to grow during what seasons?
[29:21.600 --> 29:23.600]  And I'm also doing breeding.
[29:23.600 --> 29:29.600]  We're not doing breeding anymore because of an accident I had years ago where I seeded, you know, 20 lights worth of plants.
[29:29.600 --> 29:31.600]  So no breeding on the side.
[29:31.600 --> 29:35.600]  I think there's a lot of amazing breeders in the United States right now and in California.
[29:35.600 --> 29:40.600]  That's something, though, that is a good point in terms of at different times of the year,
[29:40.600 --> 29:45.600]  different cultivars will respond better or worse.
[29:45.600 --> 29:52.600]  You know, like you might be looking at a shorter season one for a winter crop.
[29:52.600 --> 29:59.600]  Yeah, for us, I mean, we really cut back our production of certain sativas because sativas, they tend to be, like, much, much more light.
[29:59.600 --> 30:01.600]  I mean, sativas evolved around the equator.
[30:01.600 --> 30:04.600]  They have a longer flowering period.
[30:04.600 --> 30:10.600]  And also the Southern California market doesn't really like a lot of sativas in the wintertime anyways.
[30:10.600 --> 30:15.600]  I mean, right now, like, if I had, you know, 10 pounds of a sativa, I couldn't sell it to save my life.
[30:15.600 --> 30:19.600]  But as the summer months come in, they become much more popular.
[30:19.600 --> 30:25.600]  And so we're using data to, you know, what's the market demand and also what our environment allows us to grow the most efficiently.
[30:25.600 --> 30:33.600]  Because if you have a sativa that wants a lot of light, and right now our light is so weak, it's about, you know, 70% weaker than it is at the peak of summertime,
[30:33.600 --> 30:34.600]  you just won't get the yield out of that.
[30:34.600 --> 30:39.600]  But you're still using the same amount of, you know, fertilizers, nutrients, soils, labor to actually still produce that.
[30:39.600 --> 30:45.600]  So your cost to produce a gram of a sativa flower in wintertime is much, much higher than a comparable indica.
[30:45.600 --> 30:48.600]  So absolutely, we use that, like, 50%.
[30:48.600 --> 30:49.600]  Yeah.
[30:49.600 --> 30:53.600]  I mean, these sativas, like, the question was how much higher, and it's about 50% higher.
[30:53.600 --> 30:56.600]  These things like a lot of light to get that kind of yield out of them.
[30:56.600 --> 30:58.600]  I mean, Blue Dream, right?
[30:58.600 --> 31:00.600]  Classic sativa.
[31:00.600 --> 31:01.600]  Loves a lot of light.
[31:01.600 --> 31:02.600]  Great yielder.
[31:02.600 --> 31:10.600]  Great yielder, but, like, I've seen guys who just grow beautiful Blue Dream but only under very specific conditions, and one of those is a lot of light.
[31:10.600 --> 31:18.600]  I mean, the pure sativa is, like, here in Los Angeles, they'll still be going in November and December.
[31:18.600 --> 31:19.600]  Right?
[31:19.600 --> 31:22.600]  And typically you'd harvest them, like, what?
[31:22.600 --> 31:24.600]  It's the same when I was in Oakland.
[31:24.600 --> 31:29.600]  I can remember growing Thai and actually haze, the old haze.
[31:29.600 --> 31:33.600]  The old haze would still be going gangbusters in December.
[31:33.600 --> 31:44.600]  Slowly, I shouldn't say gangbusters because it all slows down because the level of light is just diminishing, both in intensity and duration.
[31:44.600 --> 31:50.600]  The question was we've been talking to other cultivators with alternative methods of farming, so dry farming, no-till farming,
[31:50.600 --> 31:53.600]  and those are very classic styles of agriculture.
[31:53.600 --> 31:56.600]  Dry farming is when there's no irrigation.
[31:56.600 --> 31:57.600]  Right?
[31:57.600 --> 32:00.600]  I mean, that's still done a lot in Southern California with certain berries, crops, and things like that.
[32:00.600 --> 32:03.600]  But as far as cannabis, what do you think?
[32:03.600 --> 32:10.600]  Also, the no-till is also something that people have done for, I don't know, centuries maybe.
[32:10.600 --> 32:13.600]  No, I haven't seen these, though.
[32:13.600 --> 32:15.600]  I haven't seen these.
[32:15.600 --> 32:19.600]  Basically, I've seen just standard growing.
[32:19.600 --> 32:20.600]  I've seen it both ways.
[32:20.600 --> 32:22.600]  I've seen it with feminized seeds.
[32:22.600 --> 32:26.600]  I've seen it with just going in there and getting the males out before they flower.
[32:26.600 --> 32:30.600]  Spacing, all different.
[32:30.600 --> 32:34.600]  Depends on what they think, the size of the plant they expect to get out of it.
[32:34.600 --> 32:39.600]  It's going to be all different ways.
[32:39.600 --> 32:48.600]  Again, it will come down to a person's own personal data, their database, whether it's in their mind or it's actually logged right in.
[32:49.600 --> 32:51.600]  Of what works best for them.
[32:51.600 --> 32:57.600]  I've seen people, when it was illegal, grow plants very close together and try to get a lot of plants.
[32:57.600 --> 33:01.600]  And now they want to grow many fewer plants, but much, much larger plants.
[33:01.600 --> 33:05.600]  This will start to flush out as different people.
[33:05.600 --> 33:11.600]  Because whether you're profitable or not is what's going to determine how long you last.
[33:11.600 --> 33:16.600]  Yeah, and for me, I mean, so you talk about dry farming.
[33:16.600 --> 33:18.600]  I haven't seen it done with cannabis.
[33:18.600 --> 33:20.600]  I've seen it done with dozens of other crops.
[33:20.600 --> 33:22.600]  But does it actually add value to the market?
[33:22.600 --> 33:23.600]  Not really.
[33:23.600 --> 33:29.600]  I mean, I think in our dynamic market, the market will make those decisions.
[33:29.600 --> 33:32.600]  I mean, one of the things I've seen is just the hand trimming aspect.
[33:32.600 --> 33:38.600]  While I still think that's the absolute best one, I mean, I've done it probably a dozen times over the last 12 months.
[33:38.600 --> 33:42.600]  Where we had 20 pounds of a strain and half of it was hand trimmed.
[33:42.600 --> 33:44.600]  The other half was a light machine trimmed on it.
[33:44.600 --> 33:47.600]  I couldn't get a dollar more for the hand trimmed stuff.
[33:47.600 --> 33:50.600]  Sure, it looked better, but it only looked marginally better.
[33:50.600 --> 33:53.600]  And while that increased our labor costs substantially to produce those pounds.
[33:53.600 --> 33:57.600]  So the aesthetics did not add value to that?
[33:57.600 --> 34:06.600]  No, the aesthetics did not add a perceived amount of value to actually recoup the cost of actually generating that perceived value, if that makes sense.
[34:06.600 --> 34:11.600]  Because it's just a very dynamic market right now, and there's a seasonality to it.
[34:11.600 --> 34:13.600]  Right now, we're in the middle of February.
[34:13.600 --> 34:14.600]  Things are a bit slow, right?
[34:14.600 --> 34:15.600]  Sales goes.
[34:15.600 --> 34:19.600]  But as soon as people get their tax returns, man, our sales go right back up.
[34:19.600 --> 34:20.600]  Maybe not so much this year.
[34:20.600 --> 34:21.600]  Yeah, maybe.
[34:21.600 --> 34:24.600]  So that's a whole other discussion for that one.
[34:24.600 --> 34:29.600]  But as far as no-till farming, we use a method of that.
[34:29.600 --> 34:34.600]  And no-till farming is meant to increase the microbial density in the soil, right?
[34:34.600 --> 34:36.600]  And that's really important for organic.
[34:36.600 --> 34:37.600]  And the structure of the soil.
[34:37.600 --> 34:38.600]  Right, yeah, exactly.
[34:38.600 --> 34:39.600]  That's soil food web.
[34:40.600 --> 34:48.600]  We use a modified version of that, and I think that's important because I think for our style of cultivation, that really increases the quality of the plant.
[34:48.600 --> 34:56.600]  We use mostly organics, and with organics, it's like painting with a very large palette of colors.
[34:56.600 --> 35:03.600]  The plant can absorb multiple sources of nitrogen from guanos and different meals and things like that.
[35:03.600 --> 35:09.600]  Whereas if you're using nitrates or synthetic fertilizers, the plant's only able to absorb from one source of that product.
[35:09.600 --> 35:11.600]  It can only absorb so much.
[35:11.600 --> 35:19.600]  But if you have 12 different sources of them, whatever input you're having, then it can actually take all that all in, metabolize it, and get a much better yield out of that.
[35:19.600 --> 35:26.600]  So yes, that no-till method does have benefits, but you have to understand how it works and works within your cultivation system.
[35:26.600 --> 35:30.600]  I mean, I've seen a lot of guys, like the raised planter beds.
[35:30.600 --> 35:32.600]  Have you ever seen that work at scale?
[35:32.600 --> 35:33.600]  No.
[35:33.600 --> 35:34.600]  Yeah, me neither, right?
[35:34.600 --> 35:43.600]  Because I mean, just so you know, raised planter beds, they're just tall boxes of soil that's living, and you don't typically replace that soil every harvest.
[35:43.600 --> 35:46.600]  You're always reusing the same soil over and over again.
[35:46.600 --> 36:00.600]  But what I've seen happen at scale, if one thing goes wrong with that soil, like root aphids, you're screwed because you're dependent upon that soil having that certain kind of nutritional microbial mix to give the plant what it needs when it needs it.
[36:00.600 --> 36:05.600]  But then if something goes wrong, if you've got 10,000 square feet of greenhouse, you're going to have a lot of problems with that.
[36:05.600 --> 36:10.600]  So again, it has a place, but you have to know where to put it.
[36:10.600 --> 36:15.600]  Yeah, the whole thing with growing outdoors is like any farming.
[36:15.600 --> 36:21.600]  You're going to have your good days and your bad days, and your good crops and your bad crops.
[36:21.600 --> 36:22.600]  I'd be terrified of growing outdoors.
[36:23.600 --> 36:33.600]  Growing outdoors here, just my experience with growing at my own place is just the budworms are devastating, right?
[36:33.600 --> 36:40.600]  Which means you're going to have to either net the entire crop, or you're going to have to do BT the entire crop.
[36:40.600 --> 36:42.600]  And the BT works wonders.
[36:42.600 --> 36:44.600]  It works great if you're consistent with it.
[36:44.600 --> 36:46.600]  It works perfectly great.
[36:47.600 --> 36:52.600]  But a lot of people just think they're going to put the seeds in the ground, they're going to water them, they're going to pull it out.
[36:52.600 --> 36:53.600]  They're not.
[36:53.600 --> 36:56.600]  They're going to have all those kinds of problems you have when you're a farmer.
[36:56.600 --> 37:03.600]  And the additional problem is that your stuff is going to be really scrutinized in terms of how clean it is.
[37:04.600 --> 37:09.600]  So there's a lot of new entrants coming to the market, like a lot of big money guys, big players.
[37:09.600 --> 37:16.600]  What kind of advice do you have for these guys who are ready to drop millions of dollars in this industry when they've never grown a plant or never sold a bud in their life?
[37:16.600 --> 37:18.600]  Find real master growers first.
[37:18.600 --> 37:19.600]  Agreed.
[37:19.600 --> 37:22.600]  And good design teams to design the facility.
[37:23.600 --> 37:25.600]  But how would you even know one?
[37:25.600 --> 37:29.600]  So this is the kind of question I get all the time, well what makes a good master grower?
[37:30.600 --> 37:33.600]  I think I'm a master grower because I've earned it.
[37:33.600 --> 37:36.600]  I've been doing this for 10 years and I've had a lot of successes.
[37:36.600 --> 37:41.600]  And I've developed a style of cultivation that I think adds a lot of high quality and consistency.
[37:41.600 --> 37:46.600]  But I don't really know what to tell someone and how to identify some of those traits.
[37:46.600 --> 37:51.600]  Let's say we've got a millionaire over here and he's about to build a massive greenhouse.
[37:51.600 --> 37:54.600]  But how is he supposed to hire that master grower?
[37:55.600 --> 38:03.600]  Well if I was that millionaire, I would go to a place that was highly successful and get their master grower to interview master growers.
[38:03.600 --> 38:05.600]  Ah, there you go.
[38:05.600 --> 38:07.600]  Hmm, that could be another consulting interview.
[38:07.600 --> 38:08.600]  Yeah, this should be your job.
[38:08.600 --> 38:10.600]  With all this free time I have, right?
[38:12.600 --> 38:16.600]  Yeah, the hell with this, you know, with this supervisor in the entire greenhouse.
[38:16.600 --> 38:18.600]  I know, I'm in the wrong business, I just consult, right?
[38:19.600 --> 38:25.600]  That's funny, I've got a friend who owns a compliance lab here in LA that we use Canisafe.
[38:25.600 --> 38:29.600]  And we're always going back and forth, it's like I'm in the wrong game, I should be doing lab testing.
[38:29.600 --> 38:32.600]  And then he looks at me, he's like no, I'm in the wrong game, I should be growing weed.
[38:33.600 --> 38:36.600]  Grass is always greener on the other side though, right?
[38:37.600 --> 38:50.190]  What's kind of some of the, like, you're at scale, you're kind of, you're kind of doing your own thing, so like, what are you experimenting with?
[38:50.190 --> 38:51.190]  Myself?
[38:51.190 --> 38:52.190]  Genetic-wise.
[38:52.190 --> 38:54.190]  Yeah, I was going to say, what are you working on?
[38:56.190 --> 39:00.190]  Well, when I have a really good clone, I feminize it.
[39:00.190 --> 39:03.190]  I feminize it because I can't maintain all these clones.
[39:03.190 --> 39:08.190]  But feminizing doesn't mean you're going to get an identical plant at all.
[39:08.190 --> 39:13.190]  It's still a mix of genes, even if it's coming from the same plant.
[39:13.190 --> 39:23.190]  Like, I'll cause, let two or three branches on a plant to transition to male flowering.
[39:23.190 --> 39:30.190]  Collect that pollen, pollinate the branches that are still female, and then grow out some of those clones the next year.
[39:30.190 --> 39:35.190]  And none of them will have the same terpene profile as the original did, right?
[39:35.190 --> 39:42.190]  Which is very disappointing, because I'm usually choosing plants that I want to propagate because they have a really great nose and a nice eye.
[39:42.190 --> 39:48.190]  But I also have been doing stuff with CBD varieties, right?
[39:48.190 --> 39:52.190]  Feminizing those, but also crossing them with good THC varieties.
[39:53.190 --> 40:00.190]  And I have F1s and F2s that this year here will be grown out to see what kind of different ratios we get.
[40:00.190 --> 40:05.190]  And try to figure out how this really works in terms of the CBD and the THC.
[40:05.190 --> 40:09.190]  This is my first time doing this.
[40:09.190 --> 40:11.190]  I was kind of surprised at the results.
[40:11.190 --> 40:17.190]  I had crossed a, I think it was a, what was called tsunami.
[40:17.190 --> 40:19.190]  I suspect it was a diesel.
[40:19.190 --> 40:23.190]  That tested about 10% CBD and no THC.
[40:23.190 --> 40:30.190]  And I crossed that with a jack that outdoors was testing at 20% THC, no CBD.
[40:30.190 --> 40:33.190]  So I thought, what am I going to get out of this?
[40:33.190 --> 40:35.190]  Well, I didn't get anything I expected.
[40:35.190 --> 40:41.190]  What I got was 12% CBD and 6% THC.
[40:41.190 --> 40:46.190]  It was a perfect two to one ratio, but it wasn't anything that I envisioned was going to happen.
[40:46.190 --> 40:49.190]  So that's why this year I've already got the seeds.
[40:49.190 --> 40:51.190]  I'm prepared to do this.
[40:51.190 --> 40:53.190]  So I'll work with another grower.
[40:53.190 --> 40:57.190]  We can grow many, many more than I can do with my little grow.
[40:57.190 --> 41:01.190]  And start to see if we can make some sense of how these ratios will come out.
[41:01.190 --> 41:04.190]  And then we can better plan on how we do this.
[41:04.190 --> 41:15.190]  I don't know if there's going to be a real market for, you know, the CBD crossed with THC.
[41:15.190 --> 41:19.190]  THC, CBD, flowers.
[41:19.190 --> 41:26.190]  Because this may all be done by the extracts where they can get exactly the ratio that you want.
[41:26.190 --> 41:36.190]  How many people, if they're taking a mix of CBD and THC, they're taking it most likely for some medicinal purpose.
[41:36.190 --> 41:40.190]  And if they're doing that, they can always get the exact ratio.
[41:40.190 --> 41:47.190]  But, you know, I want to be able to produce strains that will have those ratios anyway.
[41:47.190 --> 41:48.190]  If people want to smoke them.
[41:48.190 --> 41:55.190]  One of the things that I think will be a marketable flower that has CBD is something that has a good amount of THC.
[41:55.190 --> 42:00.190]  Let's say it has 15% THC and it has 5% CBD.
[42:00.190 --> 42:02.190]  Because I think that's something that people can smoke.
[42:02.190 --> 42:03.190]  They can get high.
[42:03.190 --> 42:04.190]  They're not going to get paranoid.
[42:04.190 --> 42:07.190]  They're not going to get anxious because the CBD is there.
[42:08.190 --> 42:13.190]  It's like coming out of alcohol prohibition, we only really had rocket fuel, right?
[42:13.190 --> 42:18.190]  We had high fruit, but then it was like, hey, fine wine eventually caught on.
[42:18.190 --> 42:20.190]  I think that's what we're getting at.
[42:20.190 --> 42:26.160]  It's like you're going by yourself and having a re-enjoyment.
[42:26.160 --> 42:35.160]  Well, one of the main objections to smoking these high THC things is people, especially novices, because they smoke too much, they do.
[42:35.160 --> 42:37.160]  They get paranoid or they get very anxious on it.
[42:37.160 --> 42:39.160]  And the CBD does kind of rack that.
[42:40.160 --> 42:44.160]  I think there will be a market for higher CBD flower.
[42:44.160 --> 42:47.160]  We grow Harlequin, which is one of the original two to one ratios.
[42:47.160 --> 42:50.160]  I got it from Harborside Health Center back in 2010.
[42:51.160 --> 42:53.160]  But that's a really medicinal strain.
[42:53.160 --> 42:55.160]  That's one of the strains that we don't covet.
[42:55.160 --> 43:00.160]  If anyone wants the cut, we will freely give that out because it has a lot of medical benefits to it.
[43:00.160 --> 43:06.160]  But I can't sell it to save my life because the real medicinal users are switching to extracts.
[43:06.160 --> 43:09.160]  It used to have a good presence on the shelf years ago.
[43:09.160 --> 43:16.160]  Shops like to have a high CBD strain because that was still when we were back all medical collective and whatnot.
[43:16.160 --> 43:20.160]  But nowadays, yeah, all the extracts have gone away.
[43:20.160 --> 43:23.160]  All the CBDs have moved all the extracts.
[43:23.160 --> 43:28.160]  But yeah, I would love a 10, 15% THC and 5 CBD flower.
[43:29.160 --> 43:31.160]  Yeah, so pheno hunting.
[43:31.160 --> 43:33.160]  Pheno hunting.
[43:33.160 --> 43:41.160]  Well, I always, I would look for the structure to make sure that, you know, I like the branching on it.
[43:41.160 --> 43:43.160]  I like the flower formation on it.
[43:43.160 --> 43:45.160]  It's nice tight buds, those sort of things.
[43:45.160 --> 43:50.160]  Whether it was healthy, a vigorous grower, whether it was a healthy plant, whether it was a healthy plant.
[43:50.160 --> 43:52.160]  I would look for the structure.
[43:52.160 --> 43:54.160]  I would look for the structure.
[43:54.160 --> 43:56.160]  It's nice tight buds, those sort of things.
[43:56.160 --> 43:58.160]  Whether it was healthy, a vigorous grower.
[43:58.160 --> 44:05.160]  And then to choose between ones that were fairly similar, I would just be, you know, rubbing the stems, branches,
[44:05.160 --> 44:10.160]  and trying to see what kind of a nose it had, whether it was strong or not strong, and so forth.
[44:10.160 --> 44:14.160]  And then ultimately, it's what they actually turn out to be afterwards.
[44:14.160 --> 44:16.160]  But you have to breed those things to begin with.
[44:16.160 --> 44:21.160]  So you have a number of candidates that you breed, and then you see, you know, what comes out of that.
[44:22.160 --> 44:27.160]  It's a process, and it's, I'd say experience really helps a lot.
[44:27.160 --> 44:31.160]  And sometimes you're surprised at what comes out.
[44:31.160 --> 44:33.160]  I mean, really.
[44:33.160 --> 44:36.160]  I've seen some very strange things happen.
[44:36.160 --> 44:39.160]  I mean, one of the ones was, if any of you have heard of Brack City.
[44:39.160 --> 44:50.160]  Brack City is this, came out of, oh, Virtual Las Vegas is one of the grows there that I consult with.
[44:51.160 --> 44:55.160]  And they crossed a Doctor Who with something else.
[44:55.160 --> 44:57.160]  I think they had some bubble gum that I had given them.
[44:57.160 --> 45:00.160]  Wow, you had a number of things go into this.
[45:00.160 --> 45:07.160]  And what happened is that the Bracks, which I hope you all know are actually where all those resin plants are.
[45:07.160 --> 45:09.160]  That's the female flowers.
[45:09.160 --> 45:11.160]  A lot of people call those calyxes.
[45:11.160 --> 45:12.160]  It's not true at all.
[45:12.160 --> 45:13.160]  They're Bracks.
[45:13.160 --> 45:16.160]  The calyx you can't even see on a female flower.
[45:17.160 --> 45:25.160]  Anyway, it's called Brack City because the Bracks are about three or four times as large as you see on a regular plant.
[45:25.160 --> 45:28.160]  I mean, they're like that size.
[45:28.160 --> 45:31.160]  So that was just something that happened.
[45:31.160 --> 45:33.160]  It turned out to be a wonderful cut.
[45:33.160 --> 45:37.160]  Yeah, for you, it's like you breed a lot of these things.
[45:37.160 --> 45:39.160]  So I'm guessing your pheno hunt's a lot shorter than ours.
[45:39.160 --> 45:45.160]  But for us, it takes about nine months from the day we pop a seed to the day we have a commercial amount of product.
[45:46.160 --> 45:48.160]  For us, that's about 20 pounds.
[45:48.160 --> 45:50.160]  Yeah, it's about a nine-month process.
[45:50.160 --> 45:56.160]  Because we start with 12 packs of seeds and then sex test them through Phyllos labs.
[45:56.160 --> 45:58.160]  And that goes down to six females if we're lucky.
[45:58.160 --> 46:01.160]  And then those six, you've got to keep all the moms on it.
[46:01.160 --> 46:02.160]  So it takes up a lot of bench space.
[46:02.160 --> 46:03.160]  It does.
[46:03.160 --> 46:04.160]  Yeah, it takes a long time.
[46:04.160 --> 46:10.160]  And it costs, like our estimates for us, over that nine-month period and the wasted bench space.
[46:10.160 --> 46:17.160]  Because now under the current regulations, if you want to sell that, each phenotype or each 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
[46:17.160 --> 46:23.160]  that's a different strain with a $750 compliance test that you need to pay if you could even sell it to market.
[46:23.160 --> 46:24.160]  Right.
[46:24.160 --> 46:30.160]  So it's about 100 grand because of lost revenue from that bench space you're taking up.
[46:30.160 --> 46:33.160]  And we only have a 70% success rate, right?
[46:33.160 --> 46:34.160]  Maybe 60.
[46:35.160 --> 46:40.160]  Well, actually, okay, here's something that we phenohunted for nine months, and then it didn't work.
[46:40.160 --> 46:41.160]  Like none of them did.
[46:41.160 --> 46:47.160]  So it's an investment, and it's almost like, I would argue, intellectual property at some point where it's like,
[46:47.160 --> 46:55.160]  we found this one, and we might not have exclusive rights to it, but this is definitely something that our company has.
[46:55.160 --> 46:56.160]  So it's a mission.
[46:56.160 --> 47:02.160]  Well, this brings up something else, and that is the tissue culture and also the testing.
[47:02.160 --> 47:10.160]  The testing is just getting more and more sophisticated where you're actually going to be able to tell what kind of profile it has
[47:10.160 --> 47:16.160]  in terms of tripping and, you know, whether it's going to be pretty strong in cannabinoids also.
[47:16.160 --> 47:24.160]  But the tissue culture will eventually, I'm sure, replace the whole mother cloning thing.
[47:24.160 --> 47:25.160]  Oh, yeah, we're putting tissue culture in the next facility.
[47:25.160 --> 47:26.160]  It turns a space.
[47:26.160 --> 47:30.160]  I mean, it's just ridiculous that it's not, you know, that you wouldn't do it.
[47:30.160 --> 47:37.160]  Yeah, our next facility we're going to be doing tissue culture and turn those straight into moms and take the cuts off those moms
[47:37.160 --> 47:44.160]  because tissue culture is just great to really revigorate the plant and revitalize it because, you know, keeping mother stock is challenging.
[47:44.160 --> 47:45.160]  It's a high skill set.
[47:45.160 --> 47:47.160]  Like I have one employee at my facility.
[47:47.160 --> 47:49.160]  That's his only job, and he's great at it.
[47:49.160 --> 47:55.160]  And if I didn't have him, we'd be taking cuts off of our vegging stock, which are always healthy and robust.
[47:55.160 --> 48:02.160]  But when you have to walk around six thousand square feet of space to get a couple thousand cuts off a plant, that takes several days.
[48:02.160 --> 48:05.160]  So, you know, having a good, healthy mother stock is important.
[48:05.160 --> 48:08.160]  But anything past our scale, I think that'd be really difficult.
[48:08.160 --> 48:11.160]  So we're going to be getting the tissue culture lab all set up and everything.
[48:11.160 --> 48:19.160]  And, you know, I think a lot of the advances that we're going to be using, it's from big ag and so, you know, a lot of data and technology.
[48:19.160 --> 48:23.160]  I don't think we're going to be having drones, you know, manicuring our plants just yet.
[48:23.160 --> 48:25.160]  There's still always going to be that human element.
[48:25.160 --> 48:28.160]  But, yeah, it's going to take a while.
[48:28.160 --> 48:32.160]  I can remember Trichome Technologies, which is out of Oakland.
[48:32.160 --> 48:36.160]  Ken Morrow still writes for Canvas Business Times.
[48:36.160 --> 48:46.160]  I remember when I visited his grow, that was the first time I saw, you know, a motherless grow because he just lollipopped his plants.
[48:46.160 --> 48:47.160]  Right. They would grow.
[48:47.160 --> 48:52.160]  He would lollipop, take those bottom ones, and that's what he, you know, he then rooted those.
[48:52.160 --> 48:54.160]  So it was just a perpetual thing like that.
[48:54.160 --> 49:01.160]  I did that for years, actually, because my problem was I couldn't train someone to maintain the mother stock well.
[49:01.160 --> 49:08.160]  Right. Because if your mother's start degrading, you're going to have like, you know, really weak cuttings, which will lead to weak veg.
[49:08.160 --> 49:12.160]  Weak veg. If your veg isn't set up right, you're going to have a bad flowering time.
[49:12.160 --> 49:21.160]  So we would just keep, you know, focus really heavily on the vegetative cycle, make sure everything was dialed in, take your cuts off that, flip into flower a few days later.
[49:21.160 --> 49:25.160]  And then flower is pretty much on autopilot if you have, you know, really good veg.
[49:25.160 --> 49:29.160]  But at this size, yeah, the mothers play a pretty important role.
[49:29.160 --> 49:31.160]  But even then, it's like, you know, we're in the middle of winter.
[49:31.160 --> 49:33.160]  We're trying to veg those things out. We're in a greenhouse.
[49:33.160 --> 49:36.160]  It takes a lot more light to keep them well.
[49:36.160 --> 49:38.160]  So, yeah, we're definitely moving towards tissue culture.
[49:38.160 --> 49:45.160]  And, yeah, and some of those old big ag practices and things like that, that I think do have a home in cannabis, especially at scale.
[49:45.160 --> 49:50.160]  And, yeah, that's just things that we have to adjust to as we get this so much bigger.
[49:50.160 --> 49:51.160]  Right.
[49:51.160 --> 49:52.160]  So.
[49:52.160 --> 49:53.160]  Onward, upward, right.
[49:53.160 --> 49:54.160]  Yeah.
[49:54.160 --> 49:55.160]  Okay.
[49:55.160 --> 49:56.160]  So I have a question.
[49:56.160 --> 49:59.160]  When you say scale, what do you mean?
[49:59.160 --> 50:01.160]  So the question was, when you say scale, what do you mean?
[50:01.160 --> 50:04.160]  I think that's anything above 10 employees, honestly.
[50:04.160 --> 50:09.160]  You know, I've scaled up other kinds of companies before, you know, manufacturing-based companies.
[50:09.160 --> 50:16.160]  And once you hit that kind of 10 people, that's when your level of communication just gets exponentially more intense.
[50:17.160 --> 50:22.160]  Because now if I'm telling you something, well, now you have to tell someone else to do something as well.
[50:22.160 --> 50:25.160]  And that just level of communication has to just get much, much more robust.
[50:25.160 --> 50:26.160]  Right.
[50:26.160 --> 50:28.160]  And we're at 40 full-time employees right now.
[50:28.160 --> 50:30.160]  So I've gone quite a bit past that.
[50:30.160 --> 50:33.160]  So I found, you know, when it was myself, I was doing things one way.
[50:33.160 --> 50:34.160]  Then I had three employees.
[50:34.160 --> 50:36.160]  Then I had to change up everything I did.
[50:36.160 --> 50:37.160]  And I hit 10.
[50:37.160 --> 50:39.160]  That was a whole other dynamic shift.
[50:39.160 --> 50:40.160]  And then I hit 30 again.
[50:40.160 --> 50:41.160]  I hit 30.
[50:41.160 --> 50:43.160]  That was another big dynamic shift of, like, actually scaling up.
[50:44.160 --> 50:53.560]  So I think anything – I'm looking more at employees because at least for cultivation, ours is like it's very tacit knowledge.
[50:53.560 --> 50:59.560]  It's like the knowledge that we've gained, you know, over the years is very hard to transfer and to translate to other people.
[50:59.560 --> 51:05.560]  Like if I can show you a plant, I think, like, you and I could tell you, like, there's a dozen things wrong with it.
[51:05.560 --> 51:09.560]  But if I try to explain it to someone who doesn't have that knowledge, that's very, very hard.
[51:09.560 --> 51:11.560]  It's like, well, it doesn't look the right kind of green.
[51:11.560 --> 51:12.560]  Right.
[51:12.560 --> 51:13.560]  It's like, well, why?
[51:13.560 --> 51:18.560]  And it's like then you have to go back in your data and understand that and make sure you understand all the moving parts in a facility.
[51:18.560 --> 51:26.560]  So anything past that 10, you have to have a lot of SOPs or a very good system in place to get you past that.
[51:26.560 --> 51:32.560]  Otherwise, you're going to be doing – or the quote, unquote, master grower is going to be doing 90 percent of the work.
[51:32.560 --> 51:37.560]  And while all those other employees are just kind of like little helpers getting him done, who can't be critical thinkers.
[51:38.560 --> 51:43.560]  And especially when you need to have data available and make people make decisions based on that data.
[51:43.560 --> 51:45.560]  That's really hard.
[51:45.560 --> 51:47.560]  And I think, too, it's like scaling.
[51:47.560 --> 51:50.560]  It's like, you know, it's very challenging.
[51:50.560 --> 51:53.560]  And scaling just to scale doesn't make sense either.
[51:53.560 --> 51:56.560]  I mean, how many mega grows are out there right now in California?
[51:56.560 --> 52:00.560]  Like hundreds of thousands of square foot in Carpinteria and Santa Barbara and things like that.
[52:00.560 --> 52:03.560]  And, yeah, sure, they're pumping out like thousands of pounds a week.
[52:03.560 --> 52:07.560]  But it's all garbage and it's all going for extracts and they're barely making any money.
[52:07.560 --> 52:09.560]  So I think from –
[52:09.560 --> 52:15.180]  Where do you go with the flour?
[52:15.180 --> 52:17.180]  We sell to distributors throughout California.
[52:17.180 --> 52:18.180]  Just flour?
[52:18.180 --> 52:19.180]  Just flour, yeah.
[52:19.180 --> 52:20.180]  We don't do extracts or anything yet.
[52:20.180 --> 52:22.180]  Like we will be doing that soon.
[52:22.180 --> 52:27.180]  Same with the ones that I collaborate with and advise.
[52:27.180 --> 52:30.180]  It's all flour because these are really high end.
[52:30.180 --> 52:32.180]  They're very, very well done.
[52:32.180 --> 52:35.180]  Everything that they grow is sold at top dollar.
[52:35.180 --> 52:36.180]  Yeah.
[52:36.180 --> 52:39.180]  What's the question?
[52:39.180 --> 52:48.180]  Yeah, so the question was what factors are involved in deciding what phenotype that we're going to select for the market?
[52:48.180 --> 52:52.180]  For me, yeah, there's a multitude of decisions.
[52:52.180 --> 52:54.180]  One, if the flowering time is right.
[52:54.180 --> 52:58.180]  Like our facility is really designed around an eight-week flowering cycle.
[52:59.180 --> 53:05.180]  And we've selectively feed on it and bred all of our cultivars and strains to fit right into that nicely.
[53:05.180 --> 53:06.180]  So it has to meet that.
[53:06.180 --> 53:07.180]  It has to yield well.
[53:07.180 --> 53:09.180]  It has to have a good aroma.
[53:09.180 --> 53:14.180]  It has to fit within our portfolio and kind of our brand as well.
[53:14.180 --> 53:17.180]  How many do you have on deck?
[53:17.180 --> 53:24.180]  Currently, my company, Palomar, has 20 different strains that we rotate on a biweekly basis.
[53:24.180 --> 53:30.180]  So we'll have, over a course of say two months, we'll have four harvests.
[53:30.180 --> 53:33.180]  And three of those harvests are all different.
[53:33.180 --> 53:35.180]  So we'll have set one, two, three, one.
[53:35.180 --> 53:39.180]  And that really helps with our design scarcity in the market.
[53:39.180 --> 53:42.180]  Like years ago, I was growing nothing but blackberry kush.
[53:42.180 --> 53:43.180]  I was crushing it.
[53:43.180 --> 53:46.180]  And then one day, everybody stopped buying it.
[53:46.180 --> 53:47.180]  I was like, crap.
[53:47.180 --> 53:51.180]  And it took me months to reset and get a new cut in there and things like that.
[53:51.180 --> 53:52.180]  So we rotate ours.
[53:52.180 --> 53:55.180]  And that's where the mother stock comes into play and just being able to pull that.
[53:55.180 --> 53:56.180]  It brings up the market.
[53:56.180 --> 53:57.180]  Yeah.
[53:57.180 --> 53:59.180]  The market is really what determines it.
[53:59.180 --> 54:04.180]  You put your stuff out there and you get back from the dispensers that this stuff disappeared in a week.
[54:04.180 --> 54:08.180]  And you've got this other stuff that's still there five, six weeks later.
[54:08.180 --> 54:10.180]  You kind of know what you should be growing.
[54:10.180 --> 54:12.180]  So that's really what determines it.
[54:12.180 --> 54:14.180]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[54:14.180 --> 54:16.180]  But I mean like the cookie strain.
[54:16.180 --> 54:19.180]  I can't grow cookies to save my life for some reason.
[54:19.180 --> 54:20.180]  The system doesn't work.
[54:20.180 --> 54:21.180]  I'm not good at it.
[54:21.180 --> 54:25.180]  That's because there's so many different cookies in actuality.
[54:25.180 --> 54:27.180]  It's all different cuts.
[54:27.180 --> 54:29.180]  Well, for me, they just never yielded very well.
[54:29.180 --> 54:30.180]  No, they don't.
[54:30.180 --> 54:31.180]  They're small bites.
[54:31.180 --> 54:32.180]  Right.
[54:32.180 --> 54:34.180]  And that's like a really high cost to produce.
[54:34.180 --> 54:36.180]  And I couldn't get more per pound for it.
[54:36.180 --> 54:39.180]  So it's like that just didn't make sense for us economically.
[54:39.180 --> 54:48.180]  Even though it flew off the shelf, I just couldn't get the kind of wholesale price point I needed to make it economically viable for our cultivation system.
[54:48.180 --> 54:50.180]  So there's a lot of factors.
[54:50.180 --> 54:59.180]  But I mean, I'd say that, yeah, what the market will bear, but making sure it fits into your own production cultivation system, making sure all those things fit is really important.
[54:59.180 --> 55:00.180]  Yeah, some of them.
[55:00.180 --> 55:06.180]  I mean, just basically, you know, one cultivar will yield more under the same conditions than another one will.
[55:06.180 --> 55:08.180]  I mean, that plays a big part.
[55:08.180 --> 55:09.180]  All those things play a part.
[55:09.180 --> 55:10.180]  Yeah.
[55:10.180 --> 55:11.180]  And that's important, too.
[55:11.180 --> 55:13.180]  Like you can have like we have some heavy yielding strains.
[55:13.180 --> 55:14.180]  We have some lower yielding ones.
[55:15.180 --> 55:21.180]  But they all have a place in there because the slightly lower yielding one, you know, might help the other ones sell as well.
[55:21.180 --> 55:29.180]  Like they're like support strains almost where it's like you have the really popular, you know, Gorilla Glue or whatnot or Wedding Cake.
[55:29.180 --> 55:36.180]  But you also have some other ones that are really complementary to that because people, let's say in Southern California, they'll buy an eighth of this and their normal one.
[55:36.180 --> 55:38.180]  But they might want to buy a gram of that other one.
[55:38.180 --> 55:41.180]  And so having that variety for a cultivator is really important.
[55:41.180 --> 55:44.180]  It keeps you and the market engaged and your buyers engaged as well.
[55:46.180 --> 55:48.180]  I haven't seen Wedding Cake yet.
[55:48.180 --> 55:49.180]  I mean in person.
[55:49.180 --> 55:51.180]  But it looks really frosty.
[55:51.180 --> 55:52.180]  I got Wedding Crasher.
[55:52.180 --> 55:53.180]  Right.
[55:53.180 --> 55:56.180]  So that's a Wedding Cake cross with a purple punch actually.
[55:56.180 --> 55:57.180]  Okay.
[55:57.180 --> 55:59.180]  Any more questions?
[55:59.180 --> 56:02.180]  So what's one of the strains that you're still chasing from your youth?
[56:02.180 --> 56:07.180]  Well, I'm not chasing it anymore, but I wish I had the original Durban Poison.
[56:07.180 --> 56:10.180]  I mean, that went to Amsterdam and became something entirely different.
[56:11.180 --> 56:13.180]  Not entirely different, but quite different.
[56:13.180 --> 56:19.180]  But the first one that I had, the one that I really liked, actually I just lost it.
[56:19.180 --> 56:21.180]  It never went to Amsterdam.
[56:21.180 --> 56:24.180]  I had two different lines of the Durban.
[56:24.180 --> 56:25.180]  I had an A and a B.
[56:25.180 --> 56:28.180]  And the A happened to be the one that I liked the most.
[56:28.180 --> 56:30.180]  It had a real licorice flavor.
[56:30.180 --> 56:33.180]  It had purple stigmas, which you just don't see.
[56:33.180 --> 56:35.180]  Purple.
[56:35.180 --> 56:37.180]  Some of them were lavender.
[56:38.180 --> 56:41.180]  That I wish I had.
[56:41.180 --> 56:47.180]  What you have now is a much more commercial kind of rendition of what went to Amsterdam.
[56:47.180 --> 56:51.180]  Part of that problem was that I made a mistake.
[56:51.180 --> 56:53.180]  It's really embarrassing.
[56:53.180 --> 56:58.180]  But I gave Skunkme and Sam, Afghani one, and I gave them the Durban, the B line.
[56:58.180 --> 57:01.180]  But the B line had a little bit of hermaphrodism in it.
[57:02.180 --> 57:06.180]  And I didn't realize it when I gave it to him at the time.
[57:06.180 --> 57:15.180]  And I didn't find this out until many years later when he told me he had to work with it, work with it, work with it to get rid of the hermaphrodism.
[57:15.180 --> 57:19.180]  So that was part of what changed that line a lot.
[57:19.180 --> 57:21.180]  But it's a heavier yielder now.
[57:21.180 --> 57:25.180]  It's not as sativa-like as it was when I first got it.
[57:26.180 --> 57:33.180]  But it was the most unusual plant that I would say variety that I grew.
[57:33.180 --> 57:36.180]  I've seen individuals that were pretty spectacular.
[57:36.180 --> 57:39.180]  But as a variety, it was just very different from anything else.
[57:39.180 --> 57:42.180]  The main thing was what a short season it was.
[57:42.180 --> 57:44.180]  I grew that.
[57:44.180 --> 57:47.180]  You were harvesting it here in Oakland in September.
[57:47.180 --> 57:52.180]  And when I brought it to New York, this is about 60 miles from New York City.
[57:53.180 --> 57:55.180]  We were harvesting some of that in August.
[57:55.180 --> 57:58.180]  It was that early.
[57:58.180 --> 58:12.180]  So being from the east originally, my whole thing with breeding when I came out here was to develop cultivars that could mature back east before the terrible weather came in.
[58:12.180 --> 58:20.180]  Because the people I knew who grew back there, they were basically growing leaf or really crappy Mexican that had some flowers.
[58:21.180 --> 58:26.180]  I saw a situation out there where I went back.
[58:26.180 --> 58:34.180]  I already had hybrids, F1s of things like Afghani and Congolese, Afghani and Nigerian, Afghani and Durban and so forth.
[58:34.180 --> 58:44.180]  But I went back and I took those sativa crosses and I back-crossed them again to Afghani to try to make sure that we got the shortness of Afghani in there.
[58:44.180 --> 58:47.180]  And they did fantastic out there.
[58:47.180 --> 58:50.180]  And those people couldn't believe how strong that pot was.
[58:50.180 --> 58:53.180]  They had never experienced anything like it in their lives.
[58:57.180 --> 58:59.180]  That's pretty cool actually.
[58:59.180 --> 59:01.180]  I don't know where that's going, but anyway.
[59:01.180 --> 59:03.180]  I just want you guys to realize that frame of reference too.
[59:03.180 --> 59:08.180]  It's like, okay, you were breeding stuff to grow in New York back when it was still super illegal.
[59:08.180 --> 59:11.180]  One seed would get you thrown in jail for a year.
[59:12.180 --> 59:16.180]  I'll tell you, that year was a very successful year.
[59:16.180 --> 59:21.180]  We grew over 500 pounds of top-notch, I mean really top-notch, it's a myth.
[59:21.180 --> 59:28.180]  And these guys wanted to do it again the next year and they were bringing in money people, right, who were just drug dealers.
[59:28.180 --> 59:30.180]  And I didn't feel good about it.
[59:30.180 --> 59:31.180]  I didn't like the people.
[59:31.180 --> 59:35.180]  I didn't like the fact that they wanted to upscale so much.
[59:35.180 --> 59:38.180]  It all became the money.
[59:38.180 --> 59:43.180]  I was more interested in the actual growing and seeing what happened and all that.
[59:43.180 --> 59:54.180]  So the next year they bought 140 acres further away from where we originally grew and went at it.
[59:54.180 --> 01:00:02.180]  And I was back in California when I got a call in July to come out there and help them, and I didn't really want to do that.
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:08.180]  But I relented because a few of the people, they had sunk everything they had into it.
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.180]  So in fact, they had to rescue them.
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:12.180]  And this was hard to believe.
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:18.180]  They had gone through a whole year of growing this very successful crop and didn't seem to have learned anything.
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:24.180]  Because they went from a place that we were growing in like bottomland, really rich, beautiful soil.
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.180]  I mean, we had to do nothing to the soil, really.
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:31.180]  You could put your hand in it and it just reached this beautiful soil.
[01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:33.180]  So it was really easy to grow there.
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:36.180]  So where did they buy this land?
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:42.180]  They bought it at another 1,500 feet higher where the soil was rocky and sandy.
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:45.180]  And additionally, New York State that year had a drought.
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:48.180]  So yeah, I come and look at the plants.
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:50.180]  They have no nutrients and no water.
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.180]  No wonder they're not growing.
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:57.180]  So anyway, I kind of remedied that and got them growing well.
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:02.180]  Sometime in late August, I had to come back to Oakland.
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:06.180]  So I said, you know, I'll be back and we'll be ready to harvest.
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:09.180]  This crop would have been over a ton.
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.180]  Would have been over a ton.
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:14.180]  But as I was flying back, they got busted.
[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.180]  So they lost everything.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:22.180]  None of them ended up in jail, partly because New York didn't understand growing at that time.
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:28.180]  They didn't understand the year before I was standing in this wonderful field.
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:32.180]  And one of the guys came out and he showed me a local newspaper.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:39.180]  The headline was that they estimated that the New York State marijuana crop that year would be worth a half a million dollars.
[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:43.180]  And I'm thinking, it's worth more right here.
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:45.180]  I mean, that's how little they knew about it.
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:48.180]  So when they got busted the next year, they didn't end up in jail.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.180]  They just lost everything.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.180]  They lost a fortune.
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:54.180]  They were lucky back then, though.
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.180]  They were lucky for that.
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.180]  But, you know, I mean, I never got busted in my life.
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.180]  Never been arrested.
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:05.180]  And a lot of it had to do with luck and a lot of it had to do with the fact that I didn't personally sell marijuana.
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.180]  I didn't sell seeds.
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.180]  I didn't sell anything.
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:11.180]  I made money from my writing and my photography.
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:18.180]  And the other was that I didn't take, except, you know, all these offers that come to Hawaii, come to here.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:21.180]  You know, do the growing for us.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.180]  You'll make a lot of money.
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:26.180]  And that wasn't really my interest so much.
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:36.800]  I really was fascinated with the plant, the botany, and that's the way I went.
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:37.800]  Any other questions?
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.800]  Great.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.800]  Thanks.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.800]  Hope you enjoyed it.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.800]  Thank you.
