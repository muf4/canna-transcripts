[00:00.440 --> 00:04.320]  All right, and we are live.
[00:04.320 --> 00:05.920]  Thank you for waiting, everyone.
[00:05.920 --> 00:08.400]  I'm in Los Angeles.
[00:08.400 --> 00:11.840]  Rotten is in Maine.
[00:11.840 --> 00:15.280]  And Michael and Rick are in Las Vegas at the Grow Off.
[00:15.280 --> 00:18.280]  So take it away, Michael.
[00:18.280 --> 00:19.280]  Okay.
[00:19.280 --> 00:30.090]  Wait, we can't hear him.
[00:30.090 --> 00:31.090]  You got to...
[00:31.090 --> 00:34.090]  Can you hear me?
[00:35.090 --> 00:44.090]  Tell them that the mic in the computer should be switched to his Zoom.
[00:44.090 --> 00:49.090]  Emily, if you can hear me.
[00:49.090 --> 00:54.090]  The mic needs to be switched to a mic.
[00:54.090 --> 01:01.090]  So we're hearing your computer speak or your computer microphone.
[01:01.090 --> 01:08.090]  You need to switch the mic source to your lab mics.
[01:08.090 --> 01:14.360]  Let's just jump right into the technical difficulties.
[01:14.360 --> 01:15.360]  It should be going.
[01:15.360 --> 01:16.360]  We'll start strong.
[01:16.360 --> 01:18.360]  Can you hear me, Peter?
[01:18.360 --> 01:24.360]  Yeah, I can hear you, but it sounds like I'm hearing you from your computer speaker.
[01:24.360 --> 01:29.360]  It shows that I'm on H6.
[01:29.360 --> 01:36.360]  So if you go into settings, audio.
[01:36.360 --> 01:39.360]  Now I hear Rick.
[01:39.360 --> 01:40.360]  Is that better?
[01:40.360 --> 01:43.360]  Yes, I now hear Rick.
[01:43.360 --> 01:46.360]  Okay, how is sound level for Rick?
[01:46.360 --> 01:48.360]  Oh, yeah, we're all good.
[01:48.360 --> 01:49.360]  It's good.
[01:49.360 --> 01:51.360]  I can hear both of you.
[01:51.360 --> 01:53.360]  All right, here we go, then.
[01:53.360 --> 01:55.360]  So it's time to jump right on in.
[01:55.360 --> 01:58.360]  All right, take two.
[01:58.360 --> 02:00.360]  What are you doing?
[02:00.360 --> 02:03.360]  Thank you, Travis.
[02:03.360 --> 02:06.360]  All right, I think we're live.
[02:06.360 --> 02:09.360]  Why don't you grab a microphone.
[02:09.360 --> 02:10.360]  We're just going to do an intro.
[02:10.360 --> 02:13.360]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:13.360 --> 02:16.360]  So the serendipity is real.
[02:16.360 --> 02:18.360]  Come on into the middle here.
[02:18.360 --> 02:21.360]  Slide on over.
[02:21.360 --> 02:25.360]  We should do an interview from the top of the rock wall.
[02:26.360 --> 02:28.360]  That sounds awesome.
[02:28.360 --> 02:30.360]  Is this just for me?
[02:30.360 --> 02:31.360]  That's just for you.
[02:31.360 --> 02:34.360]  We're all wired up so people can come in and out easy.
[02:34.360 --> 02:38.360]  So welcome, everyone, to the Grow Off Mega Awards.
[02:38.360 --> 02:40.360]  We did it!
[02:40.360 --> 02:42.360]  So you have the wonderful Samantha Taylor.
[02:42.360 --> 02:44.360]  Hello, everyone.
[02:44.360 --> 02:46.360]  I cannot believe this has happened.
[02:46.360 --> 02:47.360]  It is just incredible.
[02:47.360 --> 02:49.360]  What an event.
[02:49.360 --> 02:51.360]  The people are flowing in, growers from all over.
[02:52.360 --> 02:56.360]  We actually ended up Ubering over with a six-time belt winner.
[02:56.360 --> 02:59.360]  Chris from Colorado.
[02:59.360 --> 03:01.360]  So fantastic.
[03:01.360 --> 03:03.360]  We just met out in the Uber line.
[03:03.360 --> 03:04.360]  He jumped in.
[03:04.360 --> 03:05.360]  We rode out here together.
[03:05.360 --> 03:07.360]  He saw my royal gold hoodie and was just like, are you guys?
[03:07.360 --> 03:08.360]  And we were like, yeah.
[03:08.360 --> 03:09.360]  That's what this is all about.
[03:09.360 --> 03:10.360]  Instant friends.
[03:10.360 --> 03:16.360]  Literally, I just left talking with our 2021 Michigan genetics partner.
[03:16.360 --> 03:19.360]  The winner from that one went on and won an outdoor club that was
[03:19.360 --> 03:21.360]  totally different from the Grow Off.
[03:21.360 --> 03:23.360]  But now they're chatting with each other.
[03:23.360 --> 03:24.360]  It's like a small world.
[03:24.360 --> 03:28.360]  I love that Chris was like, I had to hit up Sam and ask her, hey,
[03:28.360 --> 03:32.360]  I have room for so many belts.
[03:32.360 --> 03:33.360]  I can't bring all six.
[03:33.360 --> 03:34.360]  Which ones do you want?
[03:34.360 --> 03:37.360]  That's a bad problem to have.
[03:37.360 --> 03:40.360]  I love it.
[03:40.360 --> 03:43.360]  And we have a lot of winners actually here tonight.
[03:43.360 --> 03:46.360]  We made sure that we knew who was flying in.
[03:47.360 --> 03:49.360]  Are we getting the awards to people in their hands?
[03:49.360 --> 03:51.360]  If not, we'll be shipping them out tomorrow.
[03:51.360 --> 03:55.360]  So if you're watching, they'll be in the mail as soon as tomorrow.
[03:55.360 --> 03:58.360]  So give us a little quick rundown on the mega award.
[03:58.360 --> 04:01.360]  So is this every state, all states, but one for this year?
[04:01.360 --> 04:02.360]  Sure.
[04:02.360 --> 04:04.360]  So we did eight states this year.
[04:04.360 --> 04:06.360]  California, you guys have some outdoor growers.
[04:06.360 --> 04:08.360]  So we needed to give them time to finish up.
[04:08.360 --> 04:12.360]  So we're doing seven states tonight from Hawaii to Maine,
[04:13.360 --> 04:14.360]  everywhere in between, except Cali.
[04:14.360 --> 04:16.360]  We'll be announcing that next month.
[04:16.360 --> 04:17.360]  It's okay.
[04:17.360 --> 04:18.360]  We get our own private party.
[04:18.360 --> 04:19.360]  We're not complaining.
[04:19.360 --> 04:20.360]  Yeah.
[04:20.360 --> 04:24.360]  So, I mean, this is the most like diverse and widespread, you know,
[04:24.360 --> 04:26.360]  amount of growers that we've ever seen in a room together.
[04:26.360 --> 04:28.360]  I think, I don't think you'll see this anywhere else.
[04:28.360 --> 04:30.360]  I completely agree.
[04:30.360 --> 04:31.360]  It's fantastic.
[04:31.360 --> 04:34.360]  I think it's a great idea to get everybody together and actually see
[04:34.360 --> 04:35.360]  from one state to the other,
[04:35.360 --> 04:39.360]  like just the camaraderie and the teamwork and everything that goes into
[04:39.360 --> 04:40.360]  it.
[04:40.360 --> 04:43.360]  It's a really unique experience and we thank you for putting it together.
[04:43.360 --> 04:45.360]  Oh, it's total labor of love.
[04:45.360 --> 04:49.360]  This is like the best part and to be able to do it times seven,
[04:49.360 --> 04:53.360]  that you guys are here helping us tell the world what's going on.
[04:53.360 --> 04:54.360]  Like, hell yeah.
[04:54.360 --> 04:57.360]  And the warehouse itself too, you know, I mean, coming into it,
[04:57.360 --> 04:59.360]  we walked in earlier today and it's just a warehouse.
[04:59.360 --> 05:03.360]  And then by the time we were leaving a few hours later, like, wow,
[05:03.360 --> 05:06.360]  this just turned into a really awesome venue.
[05:06.360 --> 05:09.360]  And then when we walked in two hours later, I was like, wow,
[05:09.360 --> 05:10.360]  it's transformed.
[05:10.360 --> 05:11.360]  Yeah.
[05:11.360 --> 05:13.360]  Cause there was a ton of people in there and the lights were dim
[05:13.360 --> 05:15.360]  perfectly and in that ambiance, you know,
[05:15.360 --> 05:19.360]  I forgot I got to do a before and after picture because you're right.
[05:19.360 --> 05:20.360]  This place was bare.
[05:20.360 --> 05:21.360]  And now we've got a rock wall.
[05:21.360 --> 05:25.360]  My ice cream truck just took off and he's got some pony dogs to represent
[05:25.360 --> 05:26.360]  Michigan on top of those.
[05:26.360 --> 05:32.360]  Like, I grew up eating pony dogs with my grandpa,
[05:32.360 --> 05:35.360]  one of the original pony dogs in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
[05:35.360 --> 05:36.360]  So that hits home.
[05:36.360 --> 05:38.360]  So are you telling everyone that genetics now,
[05:38.360 --> 05:41.360]  or do we do announce the genetics at award time?
[05:41.360 --> 05:43.360]  So we're going to do the awards at 9 PM Pacific tonight.
[05:43.360 --> 05:46.360]  And that's when we'll announce what the strength is.
[05:46.360 --> 05:48.360]  Stay tuned.
[05:48.360 --> 05:50.360]  I was hoping to get a little glimpse.
[05:50.360 --> 05:53.360]  Well, Virginia, they know the strength.
[05:53.360 --> 05:55.360]  Cause we use a bug battle winner.
[05:55.360 --> 05:56.360]  Oh, cool.
[05:56.360 --> 05:58.360]  So we do that photo contest in our off season.
[05:58.360 --> 06:00.360]  And so can amigos, you know,
[06:00.360 --> 06:03.360]  if we use a bug battle winner,
[06:03.360 --> 06:04.360]  Okay.
[06:04.360 --> 06:06.360]  So they're already in the know.
[06:06.360 --> 06:07.360]  Cool.
[06:07.360 --> 06:09.360]  Well, we can't wait to see what's next.
[06:09.360 --> 06:10.360]  We're super excited.
[06:10.360 --> 06:11.360]  We're going to go rally.
[06:11.360 --> 06:12.360]  If you win,
[06:12.360 --> 06:14.360]  Bring some other people back to sit and chat with you.
[06:14.360 --> 06:16.360]  You got some folks right here that I'd love you to talk to.
[06:16.360 --> 06:17.360]  Yeah, let's do that.
[06:17.360 --> 06:19.360]  And we're going to give you guys lots of live action.
[06:19.360 --> 06:20.360]  Camera throughout the event.
[06:20.360 --> 06:22.360]  We'll be presenting the awards.
[06:22.360 --> 06:24.360]  You'll be getting glimpses of what's going on from other cameras along the
[06:24.360 --> 06:25.360]  way.
[06:25.360 --> 06:26.360]  So thanks for coming out.
[06:26.360 --> 06:27.360]  We'll see you next time.

[06:35.360 --> 06:36.360]  So thanks for joining us here.
[06:36.360 --> 06:37.360]  Thank you,

[06:46.360 --> 06:47.360]  This is great.
[06:47.360 --> 06:48.360]  Yeah.
[06:48.360 --> 06:50.360]  All right.
[06:50.360 --> 06:52.360]  Well, we'll check out for just a second.
[06:52.360 --> 06:54.360]  We'll bring some more folks back to chat.
[06:54.360 --> 06:55.360]  Yeah.
[06:55.360 --> 06:56.360]  Who'd you have over here?
[06:56.360 --> 06:58.360]  They wanted us to tell with.
[06:58.360 --> 07:03.880]  I see belts I see belts
[07:28.760 --> 07:30.760]  Let's do it come on down
[07:32.560 --> 07:37.040]  The Rick change of plans, let's take the middle and give one mic to the outside
[07:38.080 --> 07:42.340]  Okay on each side. Okay. There's your mic for this. Yes. Yep over here
[07:45.580 --> 07:47.580]  There's a mic for these folks over here
[07:52.240 --> 07:54.640]  There you go, yeah, you can sit where you want and we up
[07:55.640 --> 08:00.320]  All right, so you guys can share mics over here
[08:03.360 --> 08:09.320]  So Rick and I are mic'd up but you guys will have to be talking into the actual physical mic. Yeah
[08:10.800 --> 08:12.800]  Yes
[08:12.800 --> 08:15.080]  There you go. There you go
[08:16.840 --> 08:18.040]  So
[08:18.040 --> 08:22.740]  Why don't you tell us we're just meeting for the first time right now and you guys are from Michigan
[08:22.980 --> 08:25.460]  I'm from Michigan as well. So this is extra special
[08:26.580 --> 08:31.660]  I feel like I did meet you guys not that long ago. I can't remember where
[08:33.980 --> 08:39.280]  We talked I remember hitting it off with you guys not that long ago to it's but
[08:39.980 --> 08:41.980]  Yeah, let's let's hear about you know
[08:42.780 --> 08:49.180]  Where you're from what you got going on and how you got into the grow up right right? You want to go please ladies first?
[08:49.820 --> 08:51.820]  There you go
[08:52.740 --> 08:57.940]  And I am a part of greener things and yeah, that's who I am
[09:01.660 --> 09:06.940]  So you guys do the genetics for the girl we did we did the genetics for not this one
[09:08.180 --> 09:10.180]  2021
[09:14.740 --> 09:16.740]  Okay
[09:16.740 --> 09:19.380]  And you're in Michigan where you out of in Michigan
[09:20.380 --> 09:24.620]  Out of he loves asking this question, she's a Michigan
[09:29.380 --> 09:32.500]  He gets this glow every time and there's a lot of care
[09:34.180 --> 09:36.180]  Something that happens multiple times a day
[09:36.180 --> 09:38.180]  We're in an environment like this
[09:56.500 --> 09:59.580]  We've talked about this a number of times we're in Humboldt and
[09:59.980 --> 10:04.340]  Obviously, there's a concentration of growers there and they're going back to the 70s and even the 60s
[10:04.340 --> 10:05.820]  right
[10:05.820 --> 10:08.660]  Being from New York and traveling the country in the 90s
[10:08.660 --> 10:15.020]  I remember the first few times I was really turned on to some really high quality craft cannabis was out of Michigan
[10:15.020 --> 10:21.660]  I don't Detroit and out of Lansing and and there was a ton of indoor coming out of the basements of some of those
[10:21.660 --> 10:27.580]  Old houses back in the 90s people have been growing in Michigan for a long time even back then
[10:27.940 --> 10:29.940]  We caught it
[10:30.940 --> 10:34.440]  Like we always had great growers in Michigan
[10:34.440 --> 10:40.500]  But once it became legal other people start coming out we start getting recognized as being great growers. We've been great
[10:51.660 --> 10:53.660]  Exactly
[11:11.460 --> 11:13.460]  The terpenes outside
[11:21.660 --> 11:25.980]  We're able to actually come to the forefront like you don't have to be you know, like
[11:39.780 --> 11:45.060]  20 years ago 20 years ago to be on these bright lights in a place like Las Vegas
[11:45.780 --> 11:50.380]  The craziest at the craziest on a microphone and we're talking about what we do
[11:51.660 --> 11:53.660]  Yeah
[11:54.540 --> 11:58.180]  So you guys do breeding and you drop the
[11:58.660 --> 12:03.620]  For the cup. What are you up to now? What's the next thing coming out of your projects in Michigan?
[12:03.620 --> 12:10.100]  You guys dropping fresh flower into dispensaries. You're dropping fresh genetics. What's happening there for you guys right now
[12:10.100 --> 12:12.100]  We just drop it fresh genetic
[12:12.100 --> 12:15.020]  We approve in Michigan, but you know Detroit
[12:15.020 --> 12:22.940]  Going to the recreational battle and everything like that. So that's what we're making. So right now we just got educational education number one
[12:22.940 --> 12:24.940]  Because people need their education
[12:24.940 --> 12:28.940]  We concentrate on breeding and coming out with different stuff
[12:28.940 --> 12:32.940]  To provide a clean quality product
[12:32.940 --> 12:34.940]  Clean, clean product
[12:34.940 --> 12:39.940]  Our main thing is really educating the people on the benefits of marijuana
[12:39.940 --> 12:41.940]  My mama had Crohn's disease
[12:41.980 --> 12:43.980]  And before she passed away a few years ago
[12:43.980 --> 12:47.980]  I got her off all her pain meds and cannabis
[12:47.980 --> 12:50.980]  So really we just been helping people getting off their pain meds
[12:50.980 --> 12:53.980]  Understanding the benefits of cannabis
[12:53.980 --> 12:56.980]  And teaching people how to grow good quality cannabis
[12:56.980 --> 12:58.980]  And what is good cannabis?
[12:58.980 --> 13:00.980]  You know good quality cannabis
[13:00.980 --> 13:02.980]  People got some SH around here
[13:02.980 --> 13:04.980]  Right
[13:04.980 --> 13:06.980]  I'm just saying
[13:06.980 --> 13:08.980]  It's not helpful
[13:08.980 --> 13:10.980]  It's not healthy
[13:11.020 --> 13:15.020]  I don't think people are educated as they should be
[13:15.020 --> 13:17.020]  About that fact
[13:17.020 --> 13:19.020]  Just having good clean cannabis
[13:19.020 --> 13:21.020]  I don't care if you smoking it
[13:21.020 --> 13:23.020]  Or just ingesting it in other ways
[13:23.020 --> 13:25.020]  It should be clean
[13:25.020 --> 13:27.020]  I think it's important to know
[13:27.020 --> 13:29.020]  What is it and what's not
[13:29.020 --> 13:31.020]  That's that discrepancy with the whole movement
[13:31.020 --> 13:33.020]  I love the movement
[13:33.020 --> 13:35.020]  Like you said it's beautiful to be out in front of these lights
[13:35.020 --> 13:37.020]  Talking about it
[13:37.020 --> 13:39.020]  Driving it in the direction where it really deserves to be
[13:39.060 --> 13:41.060]  Which it is medicinal
[13:41.060 --> 13:43.060]  It is important for society
[13:43.060 --> 13:45.060]  And it really shouldn't be about
[13:45.060 --> 13:47.060]  All of the money
[13:47.060 --> 13:49.060]  Obviously making money on something
[13:49.060 --> 13:51.060]  Of course we're all going to do it
[13:51.060 --> 13:53.060]  That's business
[13:53.060 --> 13:55.060]  Driving it and keeping that intent
[13:55.060 --> 13:57.060]  That good intention
[13:57.060 --> 13:59.060]  With that plant involved is critical
[13:59.060 --> 14:01.060]  I think it makes all the difference
[14:01.060 --> 14:03.060]  It makes me feel good about it
[14:03.060 --> 14:05.060]  Yeah
[14:05.060 --> 14:07.060]  And you get the feedback
[14:07.100 --> 14:09.100]  People who are learning clean cannabis
[14:09.100 --> 14:11.100]  After learning it
[14:11.100 --> 14:13.100]  They come back and they're like
[14:13.100 --> 14:15.100]  Wow you changed my world
[14:15.100 --> 14:17.100]  You changed my perspective
[14:17.100 --> 14:19.100]  Just like the mentors to all of us
[14:19.100 --> 14:21.100]  Who changed our perspective
[14:21.100 --> 14:23.100]  And taught us what clean cannabis was
[14:23.100 --> 14:25.100]  You should be testing
[14:25.100 --> 14:27.100]  You should be making sure there's not PGRs
[14:27.100 --> 14:29.100]  And things like that
[14:29.100 --> 14:31.100]  Even 20 years ago
[14:31.100 --> 14:33.100]  I moved from Michigan to Humboldt
[14:33.100 --> 14:35.100]  People were using PGRs
[14:35.140 --> 14:37.140]  It's really nice to see the education level coming up
[14:37.140 --> 14:39.140]  We don't want poison
[14:39.140 --> 14:41.140]  We want to heal
[14:41.140 --> 14:43.140]  Absolutely
[14:43.140 --> 14:45.140]  You have to know that it's taken away from
[14:45.140 --> 14:47.140]  If you have to put all the other stuff on there
[14:47.140 --> 14:49.140]  It's actually taken away from the beneficial properties
[14:49.140 --> 14:51.140]  That it is in cannabis
[14:51.140 --> 14:53.140]  It is a great plant
[14:53.140 --> 14:55.140]  It's been around since we've been around
[14:55.140 --> 14:57.140]  And it's one of those things too
[14:57.140 --> 14:59.140]  Using the cannabis
[14:59.140 --> 15:01.140]  Industry
[15:01.140 --> 15:03.140]  The cultivation industry
[15:03.180 --> 15:05.180]  Our food source
[15:05.180 --> 15:07.180]  Is being grown for us
[15:07.180 --> 15:09.180]  And not just zeroing in on the dollar
[15:09.180 --> 15:11.180]  That's why bad products
[15:11.180 --> 15:13.180]  When the farming practices
[15:13.180 --> 15:15.180]  Aren't correct
[15:15.180 --> 15:17.180]  Then you fall on the easy route
[15:17.180 --> 15:19.180]  Of using gnarly chemicals
[15:19.180 --> 15:21.180]  PGRs
[15:21.180 --> 15:23.180]  Again it's all about keeping that business
[15:23.180 --> 15:25.180]  To the medicinal aspect
[15:25.180 --> 15:27.180]  In check and in balance
[15:27.180 --> 15:29.180]  That makes all the difference
[15:29.180 --> 15:31.180]  That makes all of the difference
[15:31.220 --> 15:33.220]  A lot of elderly people don't understand
[15:33.220 --> 15:35.220]  They think it's a bad drug
[15:35.220 --> 15:37.220]  If you don't educate them
[15:37.220 --> 15:39.220]  And you're dealing with cancer
[15:39.220 --> 15:41.220]  You need to munch it
[15:41.220 --> 15:43.220]  If someone is working out
[15:43.220 --> 15:45.220]  They need pain relief just from working out
[15:45.220 --> 15:47.220]  You got pain cream and different things like that
[15:47.220 --> 15:49.220]  We want to educate it at a broad
[15:49.220 --> 15:51.220]  So everybody can use it
[15:51.220 --> 15:53.220]  Everybody can use it
[15:53.220 --> 15:55.220]  You don't have to have cancer
[15:55.220 --> 15:57.220]  Or dealing with an ailment for real
[15:57.220 --> 15:59.220]  Along the side there was like cancer
[15:59.260 --> 16:01.260]  The people that were prescribed
[16:01.260 --> 16:03.260]  Through the government
[16:03.260 --> 16:05.260]  Which is a real small number of people
[16:05.260 --> 16:07.260]  It was like major diseases
[16:07.260 --> 16:09.260]  You were a stage 4 checking out
[16:09.260 --> 16:11.260]  They were basically like
[16:11.260 --> 16:13.260]  You can use cannabis
[16:13.260 --> 16:15.260]  You're fucked anyway
[16:15.260 --> 16:17.260]  But now it's everything
[16:17.260 --> 16:19.260]  It's arthritis, coma, just ordinary back pain
[16:19.260 --> 16:21.260]  Menstrual cramps
[16:21.260 --> 16:23.260]  Mental health
[16:23.260 --> 16:25.260]  I have a special needs brother
[16:25.260 --> 16:27.260]  And for a while
[16:27.300 --> 16:29.300]  He was in and out of the hospital
[16:29.300 --> 16:31.300]  It was around COVID time
[16:31.300 --> 16:33.300]  It was making me cringe
[16:33.300 --> 16:35.300]  We were limited on who could go in and visit him
[16:35.300 --> 16:37.300]  I was slipping in tension
[16:37.300 --> 16:39.300]  And it was killing him
[16:39.300 --> 16:41.300]  Slipping it to him though
[16:41.300 --> 16:43.300]  I had to eventually tell my mom
[16:43.300 --> 16:45.300]  What I was doing
[16:45.300 --> 16:47.300]  It led to him, long story short
[16:47.300 --> 16:49.300]  He's been taking tension for over a year now
[16:49.300 --> 16:51.300]  A little over a year now
[16:51.300 --> 16:53.300]  He was having grand ball seizures
[16:53.300 --> 16:55.300]  I'm talking about a couple of weeks
[16:55.340 --> 16:57.340]  He hasn't had one since he started taking tension
[16:57.340 --> 16:59.340]  Wow
[16:59.340 --> 17:01.340]  I would love hearing that
[17:01.340 --> 17:03.340]  Exactly, right
[17:03.340 --> 17:05.340]  Literally that's what it is though
[17:05.340 --> 17:07.340]  Before then he was taking all this other medicine
[17:07.340 --> 17:09.340]  And everything
[17:09.340 --> 17:11.340]  He stayed in the hospital having seizures
[17:11.340 --> 17:13.340]  Literally when he started taking
[17:13.340 --> 17:15.340]  Tension he hasn't since
[17:15.340 --> 17:17.340]  That's what we do
[17:17.340 --> 17:19.340]  I know it has healing properties
[17:19.340 --> 17:21.340]  I know, I'm a believer
[17:21.340 --> 17:23.340]  We have these
[17:23.380 --> 17:25.380]  Fiddlers Greens, they're out of Northern California
[17:25.380 --> 17:27.380]  And they've competed
[17:27.380 --> 17:29.380]  In the Grow Up competition
[17:29.380 --> 17:31.380]  I'm not sure if they're going to be here tonight
[17:31.380 --> 17:33.380]  I don't know
[17:33.380 --> 17:35.380]  They have a few tinctures
[17:35.380 --> 17:37.380]  They had a whole program for children
[17:37.380 --> 17:39.380]  I remember these guys and their team
[17:39.380 --> 17:41.380]  They would go around and they had developed
[17:41.380 --> 17:43.380]  This relationship with their parents
[17:43.380 --> 17:45.380]  The parents of these children
[17:45.380 --> 17:47.380]  That had epilepsy and seizure issues
[17:47.380 --> 17:49.380]  And man, the driving force
[17:49.380 --> 17:51.380]  Was so amazing
[17:51.420 --> 17:53.420]  It was amazing to witness
[17:53.420 --> 17:55.420]  They were so excited to make these house visits
[17:55.420 --> 17:57.420]  To these kids
[17:57.420 --> 17:59.420]  Because they're like, this kid hasn't had a seizure
[17:59.420 --> 18:01.420]  In three fucking years
[18:01.420 --> 18:03.420]  That's passionate
[18:03.420 --> 18:05.420]  Who cares how you put the money in the gas tank
[18:05.420 --> 18:07.420]  We're going to figure out how to get there
[18:07.420 --> 18:09.420]  Because that was like driving their soul
[18:09.420 --> 18:11.420]  Their mission, their work
[18:11.420 --> 18:13.420]  Was like, holy shit man, we're seeing this in real time
[18:13.420 --> 18:15.420]  This is happening
[18:15.420 --> 18:17.420]  And it's that connection
[18:17.420 --> 18:19.420]  That gets so many people
[18:19.460 --> 18:21.460]  Into cannabis
[18:21.460 --> 18:23.460]  And drives a passion
[18:23.460 --> 18:25.460]  That is unstoppable
[18:25.460 --> 18:27.460]  We go down a rabbit hole
[18:27.460 --> 18:29.460]  For you it ended up in breeding
[18:29.460 --> 18:31.460]  And now you're working with specific genetics
[18:31.460 --> 18:33.460]  Are you working with genetics specifically for healing
[18:33.460 --> 18:35.460]  Are you working more for terpenes or flavors
[18:35.460 --> 18:37.460]  What's your primary goals in breeding right now
[18:37.460 --> 18:39.460]  Are you looking for
[18:39.460 --> 18:41.460]  That next hot thing
[18:41.460 --> 18:43.460]  Are you focusing on
[18:43.460 --> 18:45.460]  Something more nuanced
[18:45.460 --> 18:47.460]  A little bit of both
[18:47.500 --> 18:49.500]  That's what everybody always wants
[18:49.500 --> 18:51.500]  When it comes to breeding
[18:51.500 --> 18:53.500]  Then you want it toned down
[18:53.500 --> 18:55.500]  To the strands that really help people
[18:55.500 --> 18:57.500]  When it comes to terpene
[18:57.500 --> 18:59.500]  Because we don't understand that different terpenes
[18:59.500 --> 19:01.500]  Different smells help you in a different way
[19:01.500 --> 19:03.500]  So it's actually learning
[19:03.500 --> 19:05.500]  Learning that and understanding that part
[19:05.500 --> 19:07.500]  Is what we focus on too
[19:07.500 --> 19:09.500]  Learning everything about the plant
[19:09.500 --> 19:11.500]  Yeah, the whole picture
[19:11.500 --> 19:13.500]  It all plays a role
[19:13.500 --> 19:15.500]  And that's really interesting that you say that too
[19:15.540 --> 19:17.540]  You're hearing more and more people doing terpene
[19:17.540 --> 19:19.540]  Aromatherapies and things like that
[19:19.540 --> 19:21.540]  Not just consuming
[19:21.540 --> 19:23.540]  Tinctures, smoking
[19:23.540 --> 19:25.540]  Whatever
[19:25.540 --> 19:27.540]  But the aromatherapy and those terpene connections
[19:27.540 --> 19:29.540]  In our brains are so little understood
[19:29.540 --> 19:31.540]  Right, exactly
[19:31.540 --> 19:33.540]  And you need to come out to the forefront
[19:33.540 --> 19:35.540]  So you can understand that too
[19:35.540 --> 19:37.540]  We want to understand the whole thing about the plant
[19:37.540 --> 19:39.540]  Everything
[19:39.540 --> 19:41.540]  We call our campaign
[19:41.540 --> 19:43.540]  All Things Cannabis
[19:43.580 --> 19:45.580]  All Things Cannabis
[19:45.580 --> 19:47.580]  Everything
[19:47.580 --> 19:49.580]  It's so awesome
[19:49.580 --> 19:51.580]  Wow, thanks for coming and joining us
[19:51.580 --> 19:53.580]  What are you most looking forward to
[19:53.580 --> 19:55.580]  At the awards tonight?
[19:55.580 --> 19:57.580]  To have fun
[19:57.580 --> 19:59.580]  To see who won
[19:59.580 --> 20:01.580]  I'm a little mad because we entered the contest
[20:01.580 --> 20:03.580]  And we had some other things
[20:03.580 --> 20:05.580]  In the way that kind of slowed us down
[20:05.580 --> 20:07.580]  So we couldn't get our plant done
[20:07.580 --> 20:09.580]  For testing
[20:09.580 --> 20:11.580]  It is beautiful
[20:11.620 --> 20:13.620]  I just wanted to bring the whole plant
[20:13.620 --> 20:15.620]  To the pot
[20:15.620 --> 20:17.620]  We want to see
[20:17.620 --> 20:19.620]  What the strand was
[20:19.620 --> 20:21.620]  And everything like that
[20:21.620 --> 20:23.620]  And meet like-minded people
[20:23.620 --> 20:25.620]  And learn more and more about the plant
[20:25.620 --> 20:27.620]  I'm glad you're here
[20:27.620 --> 20:29.620]  You're not the only person
[20:29.620 --> 20:31.620]  That happens every year
[20:31.620 --> 20:33.620]  It doesn't finish up
[20:33.620 --> 20:35.620]  Or maybe things happen in life
[20:35.620 --> 20:37.620]  On the farm that take your attention away
[20:37.620 --> 20:39.620]  That's the beauty of having this thing
[20:39.660 --> 20:41.660]  It's always going to be next year
[20:41.660 --> 20:43.660]  You can dive right back in
[20:43.660 --> 20:45.660]  Last year
[20:45.660 --> 20:47.660]  We had just met Sam
[20:47.660 --> 20:49.660]  And we provided P33
[20:49.660 --> 20:51.660]  And we seen you guys on YouTube
[20:51.660 --> 20:53.660]  Do you remember?
[20:53.660 --> 20:55.660]  We watched you
[20:55.660 --> 20:57.660]  At some kind of theater
[20:57.660 --> 20:59.660]  Or fountain
[20:59.660 --> 21:01.660]  That's a historic minor theater
[21:01.660 --> 21:03.660]  Exactly
[21:03.660 --> 21:05.660]  Next year we're going to be there
[21:05.660 --> 21:07.660]  So this year we're here
[21:07.700 --> 21:09.700]  You hear that?
[21:09.700 --> 21:11.700]  At home, next year folks
[21:11.700 --> 21:13.700]  Come join us
[21:13.700 --> 21:15.700]  Wonderful
[21:15.700 --> 21:17.700]  Let's check
[21:17.700 --> 21:19.700]  Some things out
[21:19.700 --> 21:21.700]  We're going to go find some flower to smoke
[21:21.700 --> 21:23.700]  See if anybody has this year's entry
[21:23.700 --> 21:25.700]  For us to get down with
[21:25.700 --> 21:27.700]  Let me know if you find it
[21:27.700 --> 21:29.700]  If you guys want to do a little shoutout

[22:43.820 --> 22:45.820]  We haven't any
[22:47.820 --> 22:49.820]  Yup
[22:49.820 --> 23:57.420]  There
[23:57.420 --> 23:59.420]  Now there's no audio avatar
[23:59.420 --> 24:01.420]  And I can talk
[24:01.420 --> 24:03.420]  Mwahahahaha
[24:03.420 --> 24:05.420]  You are here at the Grow Off
[24:05.460 --> 24:07.460]  Is my audio coming through
[24:07.460 --> 24:09.460]  Alright there Rotten
[24:09.460 --> 24:11.460]  Nope
[24:11.460 --> 24:13.460]  Maybe
[24:13.460 --> 24:15.460]  Maybe it's okay
[24:15.460 --> 24:22.890]  Let's see
[24:22.890 --> 24:24.890]  Oh
[24:24.890 --> 24:26.890]  Sorry about that
[24:26.890 --> 24:28.890]  Hope you guys are doing well
[24:28.890 --> 24:30.890]  I did this last year
[24:30.890 --> 24:32.890]  Do you want to hop on stage Rotten
[24:32.890 --> 24:34.890]  And we can take over for a second
[24:34.890 --> 24:36.890]  3 out of 10
[24:36.890 --> 24:38.890]  Better now
[24:38.930 --> 24:40.930]  Want to smoke a doobie or dab with me
[24:40.930 --> 24:42.930]  While these guys run around and find other people
[24:42.930 --> 24:44.930]  Let's do it
[24:44.930 --> 24:46.930]  Oh
[24:46.930 --> 24:48.930]  Hi Rotten
[24:48.930 --> 24:50.930]  Mwahahahaha
[24:50.930 --> 24:52.930]  We gotta try and get Emily
[24:52.930 --> 24:54.930]  To have a dab on screen
[24:54.930 --> 24:56.930]  I wanted to stay mostly
[24:56.930 --> 24:58.930]  Behind the scenes
[24:58.930 --> 25:00.930]  That's why I know it's a big deal
[25:00.930 --> 25:02.930]  It is it's really good
[25:02.930 --> 25:04.930]  It's cool man they're right off
[25:04.930 --> 25:06.930]  It will be interlude
[25:06.970 --> 25:08.970]  We can't even hear the music
[25:08.970 --> 25:10.970]  Emily do we have music
[25:10.970 --> 25:12.970]  And where's
[25:12.970 --> 25:14.970]  Do you guys have the website for the Grow Off
[25:16.970 --> 25:18.970]  2022
[25:22.970 --> 25:24.970]  Oh
[25:24.970 --> 25:29.330]  I'll get away
[25:29.330 --> 25:31.330]  I try to keep it consistently
[25:31.330 --> 25:33.330]  It doesn't even have to be that close
[25:33.330 --> 25:35.330]  They're pretty dynamic
[25:35.330 --> 25:37.330]  Sometimes you know how people
[25:37.370 --> 25:39.370]  The mic is like all over
[25:41.370 --> 25:43.370]  We got another Michigander in the house
[25:43.370 --> 25:45.370]  Yes sir
[25:45.370 --> 25:47.370]  Tell us a little bit about that
[25:47.370 --> 25:49.370]  Fancy hardware you're wearing
[25:49.370 --> 25:51.370]  The genetics you rocked
[25:51.370 --> 25:53.370]  Where you're from what you do my friend
[25:53.370 --> 25:55.370]  I'm Kenna Boy from the Marquee
[25:55.370 --> 25:57.370]  I'm the 2021
[25:57.370 --> 25:59.370]  Terpene's champion of Michigan
[25:59.370 --> 26:01.370]  Yeah
[26:01.370 --> 26:03.370]  I am the only person to
[26:03.370 --> 26:05.370]  Place in both categories
[26:05.410 --> 26:07.410]  I'm third place in potency
[26:07.410 --> 26:09.410]  Okay
[26:09.410 --> 26:11.410]  It just goes to show that entourage is real
[26:11.410 --> 26:13.410]  When the Terps are top notch
[26:13.410 --> 26:15.410]  Often the cannabinoids are too
[26:15.410 --> 26:17.410]  Yes sir I believe that too
[26:17.410 --> 26:19.410]  So was that the
[26:19.410 --> 26:21.410]  What peaches and cream
[26:21.410 --> 26:23.410]  Yes the peaches and cream
[26:23.410 --> 26:25.410]  Greener things
[26:25.410 --> 26:27.410]  Tell us a little bit about that genetic
[26:27.410 --> 26:29.410]  How it grew for you
[26:29.410 --> 26:31.410]  What you felt about the Terps
[26:31.410 --> 26:33.410]  What profiles you had
[26:33.450 --> 26:35.450]  What was familiar with the genetics
[26:35.450 --> 26:37.450]  To me I got a lot of tangy off of it
[26:37.450 --> 26:39.450]  But it was
[26:39.450 --> 26:41.450]  A slow grower to me
[26:41.450 --> 26:43.450]  It was a short squat plant
[26:43.450 --> 26:45.450]  Okay
[26:45.450 --> 26:47.450]  Some of the best ones are
[26:47.450 --> 26:49.450]  I've noticed some of the best ones
[26:49.450 --> 26:51.450]  Don't grow quick
[26:51.450 --> 26:53.450]  Hard to fish
[26:53.450 --> 26:55.450]  Did it have the real short petioles
[26:55.450 --> 26:57.450]  Real wide
[26:57.450 --> 26:59.450]  Yes
[26:59.450 --> 27:01.450]  But it was really triked out
[27:01.490 --> 27:03.490]  Really frosty plant
[27:03.490 --> 27:05.490]  Fragrant
[27:05.490 --> 27:07.490]  Colorful
[27:07.490 --> 27:09.490]  It was a pretty good plant to grow
[27:09.490 --> 27:11.490]  Is that something you kept in your stable
[27:11.490 --> 27:13.490]  Yes sir
[27:13.490 --> 27:15.490]  When you win an award
[27:15.490 --> 27:17.490]  With something
[27:17.490 --> 27:19.490]  That's sticking around for at least a little bit
[27:19.490 --> 27:21.490]  You think so but some people
[27:21.490 --> 27:23.490]  Just chase the next thing so hard
[27:23.490 --> 27:25.490]  By the time they realize that something was
[27:25.490 --> 27:27.490]  Fantastic it's already gone
[27:27.490 --> 27:29.490]  Well I only grew it that once
[27:29.530 --> 27:31.530]  So I wanted to grow it again
[27:33.530 --> 27:35.530]  To let it fully acclimate
[27:35.530 --> 27:37.530]  To my growth
[27:37.530 --> 27:39.530]  And grow it out a few times
[27:39.530 --> 27:41.530]  See if I can bring more out of it
[27:43.530 --> 27:45.530]  People on the chat are asking
[27:45.530 --> 27:47.530]  What's your name
[27:47.530 --> 27:49.530]  Canna Boy Terp Up
[27:49.530 --> 27:51.530]  Detroit Michigan
[27:51.530 --> 27:53.530]  Alright
[27:53.530 --> 27:55.530]  I'm from Michigan
[27:55.530 --> 27:57.530]  And it's so crazy
[27:57.570 --> 27:59.570]  It's so crazy
[27:59.570 --> 28:01.570]  To see the transformation
[28:01.570 --> 28:03.570]  Of 20 years ago to today
[28:03.570 --> 28:05.570]  I bailed out of Michigan 20 years ago
[28:05.570 --> 28:07.570]  Because it was hot
[28:07.570 --> 28:09.570]  Moved to Humboldt
[28:09.570 --> 28:11.570]  There's a renaissance happening
[28:11.570 --> 28:13.570]  With REC really starting to bloom
[28:13.570 --> 28:15.570]  You're starting to see
[28:15.570 --> 28:17.570]  The real integration happening
[28:17.570 --> 28:19.570]  What's the industry like
[28:19.570 --> 28:21.570]  Are you seeing changes for home growers
[28:21.570 --> 28:23.570]  What's going on in your world
[28:23.570 --> 28:25.570]  Well
[28:25.610 --> 28:27.610]  The biggest changes I see
[28:29.610 --> 28:31.610]  They want to stop the home grows
[28:31.610 --> 28:33.610]  Pretty much
[28:33.610 --> 28:35.610]  Or cap it
[28:37.610 --> 28:39.610]  I think we wrote it into our
[28:39.610 --> 28:41.610]  Constitution I think we should uphold that
[28:43.610 --> 28:45.610]  You gotta fight for it
[28:45.610 --> 28:47.610]  That's the one thing with these states
[28:47.610 --> 28:49.610]  As they go legal
[28:49.610 --> 28:51.610]  There's always gonna be those big money
[28:51.610 --> 28:53.610]  In the back there
[28:53.650 --> 28:55.650]  Trying to take full control over
[28:55.650 --> 28:57.650]  The states that have been able
[28:57.650 --> 28:59.650]  To keep the home grow alive
[28:59.650 --> 29:01.650]  Keep the culture alive
[29:01.650 --> 29:03.650]  That's the big thing they don't understand
[29:03.650 --> 29:05.650]  It's a culture
[29:05.650 --> 29:07.650]  A community
[29:09.650 --> 29:11.650]  It's not just growing pot
[29:11.650 --> 29:13.650]  And making money
[29:13.650 --> 29:15.650]  It's more than that
[29:15.650 --> 29:17.650]  It brings people together
[29:17.650 --> 29:19.650]  All the festivals
[29:19.650 --> 29:21.650]  All the little trinkets
[29:21.690 --> 29:23.690]  You know
[29:23.690 --> 29:25.690]  Like you say
[29:25.690 --> 29:27.690]  20 years ago
[29:27.690 --> 29:29.690]  Everybody wasn't wearing
[29:29.690 --> 29:31.690]  A t-shirt with marijuana leaves
[29:31.690 --> 29:33.690]  You know what I mean
[29:33.690 --> 29:35.690]  Especially 30 years ago
[29:35.690 --> 29:37.690]  Yeah right
[29:37.690 --> 29:39.690]  And that's the truth
[29:39.690 --> 29:41.690]  You're seeing the awareness rise
[29:41.690 --> 29:43.690]  I think a big part of this
[29:43.690 --> 29:45.690]  Time period of education
[29:45.690 --> 29:47.690]  Is telling people to stand up
[29:47.690 --> 29:49.690]  Fight to keep those home grows
[29:49.730 --> 29:51.730]  And keep those medical model pieces
[29:51.730 --> 29:53.730]  In place as REC comes on board
[29:53.730 --> 29:55.730]  Because REC is threatening
[29:55.730 --> 29:57.730]  The culture in a big way
[29:57.730 --> 29:59.730]  By corporatizing cannabis
[29:59.730 --> 30:01.730]  So people out there fighting hard
[30:01.730 --> 30:03.730]  Growing the good genetics
[30:03.730 --> 30:05.730]  Keeping it homey
[30:05.730 --> 30:07.730]  It's what we need
[30:07.730 --> 30:09.730]  Yeah
[30:09.730 --> 30:11.730]  I think there's probably ways
[30:11.730 --> 30:13.730]  That you can regulate the market
[30:13.730 --> 30:15.730]  And still keep
[30:15.730 --> 30:17.730]  The farmer vibe to it
[30:17.770 --> 30:19.770]  You know what I mean
[30:19.770 --> 30:21.770]  I think people should be able to seek out
[30:21.770 --> 30:23.770]  Good growers and gardeners
[30:23.770 --> 30:25.770]  And be able to get
[30:25.770 --> 30:27.770]  Stuff that they produce
[30:27.770 --> 30:29.770]  Makes sense man
[30:29.770 --> 30:31.770]  That farmer's market model
[30:31.770 --> 30:33.770]  We were talking about it on the way over here today
[30:33.770 --> 30:35.770]  I like to see more
[30:35.770 --> 30:37.770]  States adopting the deli model
[30:37.770 --> 30:39.770]  Being able to open the jar and see the flower
[30:39.770 --> 30:41.770]  And pull it out
[30:41.770 --> 30:43.770]  And interact with it before you choose it
[30:43.770 --> 30:45.770]  Instead of this hermetically sealed
[30:45.810 --> 30:47.810]  Mystery weed
[30:47.810 --> 30:49.810]  Yes
[30:49.810 --> 30:51.810]  It kind of destroys that connection
[30:51.810 --> 30:53.810]  With people and place and cultivator
[30:53.810 --> 30:55.810]  Yeah
[30:55.810 --> 30:57.810]  I've noticed
[30:57.810 --> 30:59.810]  That you know
[30:59.810 --> 31:01.810]  It has definitely changed
[31:01.810 --> 31:03.810]  Like when you go to the shows and everything
[31:03.810 --> 31:05.810]  You do need
[31:05.810 --> 31:07.810]  The packaging
[31:07.810 --> 31:09.810]  And the big banners
[31:09.810 --> 31:11.810]  And all of that sort of thing
[31:11.810 --> 31:13.810]  Before you could just take your jars
[31:13.850 --> 31:15.850]  Yeah
[31:15.850 --> 31:17.850]  Being a new industry
[31:17.850 --> 31:19.850]  Is tough
[31:19.850 --> 31:21.850]  There's going to be so many different ways
[31:21.850 --> 31:23.850]  To try to get it to the people
[31:23.850 --> 31:25.850]  Legitimize it
[31:25.850 --> 31:27.850]  Make it profitable
[31:27.850 --> 31:29.850]  With such a baby industry
[31:29.850 --> 31:31.850]  It's been a black market
[31:31.850 --> 31:33.850]  Obviously forever
[31:33.850 --> 31:35.850]  The stigma has been just as rich as anything
[31:35.850 --> 31:37.850]  You know
[31:37.850 --> 31:39.850]  And trying to navigate through
[31:39.850 --> 31:41.850]  That stigma lifting
[31:41.890 --> 31:43.890]  And adapting to a whole new industry
[31:43.890 --> 31:45.890]  And you know
[31:45.890 --> 31:47.890]  Basically welcoming
[31:47.890 --> 31:49.890]  This new culture
[31:49.890 --> 31:51.890]  That's always been in existence in America
[31:51.890 --> 31:53.890]  You know
[31:53.890 --> 31:55.890]  Whether it's child proof or the packaging
[31:55.890 --> 31:57.890]  Or shelf life
[31:57.890 --> 31:59.890]  Or profiteering
[31:59.890 --> 32:01.890]  There's so many factors
[32:01.890 --> 32:03.890]  And you know it's troubling
[32:03.890 --> 32:05.890]  Every state has to do it independently
[32:05.890 --> 32:07.890]  Because obviously there's no unity in that
[32:07.890 --> 32:09.890]  Right
[32:09.930 --> 32:11.930]  And so you have to ideally get to a place
[32:11.930 --> 32:13.930]  Where you're like this is how it makes the most sense
[32:13.930 --> 32:15.930]  Instead of every state
[32:15.930 --> 32:17.930]  Just being like well we're going to do it over here
[32:17.930 --> 32:19.930]  Like this
[32:19.930 --> 32:21.930]  And it's going to take probably 10 or 15 years
[32:21.930 --> 32:23.930]  For us all to work out some of those kinks
[32:23.930 --> 32:25.930]  Right
[32:25.930 --> 32:27.930]  It's definitely going to take time
[32:27.930 --> 32:29.930]  So yeah we appreciate you being a warrior
[32:29.930 --> 32:31.930]  One of the people that are trying to navigate it all with us
[32:31.930 --> 32:33.930]  Thank you
[32:33.930 --> 32:35.930]  Yeah I'm super thankful for opportunities like this
[32:35.930 --> 32:37.930]  To connect with people that
[32:37.970 --> 32:39.970]  I met 20 or 30 years ago
[32:39.970 --> 32:41.970]  And some places
[32:41.970 --> 32:43.970]  Some states today still
[32:43.970 --> 32:45.970]  Where people don't have the opportunity to connect as humans
[32:45.970 --> 32:47.970]  Over this common ground that we all share
[32:47.970 --> 32:49.970]  And so it's really cool
[32:49.970 --> 32:51.970]  To me to find
[32:51.970 --> 32:53.970]  Two Michiganders in Las Vegas
[32:53.970 --> 32:55.970]  Randomly connecting for the first time
[32:55.970 --> 32:57.970]  These are the moments that make the grow off
[32:57.970 --> 32:59.970]  That make cannabis special to me
[32:59.970 --> 33:01.970]  So thanks for taking the time to sit with us
[33:01.970 --> 33:03.970]  And share a little about what you do
[33:03.970 --> 33:05.970]  You're welcome
[33:06.010 --> 33:08.010]  If you have any other social media that you want to give a plug
[33:08.010 --> 33:10.010]  This would be a good time
[33:10.010 --> 33:12.010]  Just follow me on Instagram
[33:12.010 --> 33:14.010]  Cannaboy313
[33:14.010 --> 33:16.010]  Urban Farms
[33:16.010 --> 33:18.010]  That's it
[33:18.010 --> 33:20.010]  Right on, cool man
[33:20.010 --> 33:22.010]  What do you think about standing up and showing off that belt for the camera
[33:22.010 --> 33:24.010]  Let's check that thing out
[33:24.010 --> 33:26.010]  Yeah
[33:26.010 --> 33:28.010]  Yeah
[33:28.010 --> 33:30.010]  Terpenes for the win people
[33:30.010 --> 33:32.010]  It's a pleasure brother
[33:32.010 --> 33:34.010]  Thank you so much
[33:34.050 --> 33:36.050]  Hey
[38:42.870 --> 38:46.210]  So
[38:46.210 --> 38:48.210]  So Rick and I are mic'd but you'll have to
[38:56.920 --> 38:58.920]  Or let's do that
[38:58.920 --> 39:00.920]  Come on in Rick
[39:00.920 --> 39:02.920]  You want me to sit over there or what do you want me to do
[39:02.920 --> 39:04.920]  Come on in on the other side
[39:04.920 --> 39:06.920]  This is good
[39:08.920 --> 39:10.920]  The lights are a little blinding
[39:12.920 --> 39:14.920]  You'll acclimate after a while
[39:14.960 --> 39:16.960]  Yeah
[39:16.960 --> 39:18.960]  Okay perfect
[39:18.960 --> 39:20.960]  Yeah in the beginning it's like that isn't right
[39:20.960 --> 39:22.960]  We tried to turn them down
[39:22.960 --> 39:24.960]  But she was going to bite our heads off
[39:24.960 --> 39:26.960]  So we're going to kick this off
[39:26.960 --> 39:28.960]  As has been
[39:28.960 --> 39:30.960]  Requested by the production team
[39:30.960 --> 39:32.960]  With an introduction
[39:32.960 --> 39:34.960]  Tell us who you are, where you're from
[39:34.960 --> 39:36.960]  And I already know you Sarah
[39:36.960 --> 39:38.960]  But I'm really interested to hear your story as well
[39:38.960 --> 39:40.960]  So
[39:40.960 --> 39:42.960]  Welcome to the Royal Grown Radio
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  Grow Off Mega Awards
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  So I'm quite excited to meet you
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  Well I'm Sarah and I'm with
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  Dirty Business Soil Consulting and Analysis
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  And I've known Royal Gold for
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  I don't even know
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  A decade plus
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  And we are all
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  Business owners
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  We all run businesses in Humboldt County
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  California and I run
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  An agricultural testing lab and consulting firm
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  That is now under the care of Royal Gold
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  And they're doing their
[40:11.040 --> 40:13.040]  Internal quality control testing
[40:13.040 --> 40:15.040]  With this soil testing lab so it's really cool
[40:15.040 --> 40:17.040]  To keep it in the family and keep it in
[40:17.040 --> 40:19.040]  Our community
[40:19.040 --> 40:21.040]  My most recent passion is data analytics
[40:21.040 --> 40:23.040]  And one of the things that I'm doing here today
[40:23.040 --> 40:25.040]  Mainly is to talk about
[40:25.040 --> 40:27.040]  The data analysis
[40:27.040 --> 40:29.040]  That I did on the Grow Off 2021
[40:29.040 --> 40:31.040]  Data so the growers
[40:31.040 --> 40:33.040]  All the competitors put in their
[40:33.040 --> 40:35.040]  Grow data and then they
[40:35.040 --> 40:37.040]  Also get all the lab testing from the terpenes
[40:37.040 --> 40:39.040]  And cannabinoid profiles of all of their
[40:39.080 --> 40:41.080]  Cultivars and so I took all of that
[40:41.080 --> 40:43.080]  Data and I made charts and graphs
[40:43.080 --> 40:45.080]  And made different assessments
[40:45.080 --> 40:47.080]  Of the data to show
[40:47.080 --> 40:49.080]  What it all means and what's going on
[40:49.080 --> 40:51.080]  In each of the states so that's what I'm
[40:51.080 --> 40:53.080]  Into now
[40:53.080 --> 40:55.080]  Amazing
[40:55.080 --> 40:57.080]  My name is Erin Purchase
[40:57.080 --> 40:59.080]  I own a dispensary in
[40:59.080 --> 41:01.080]  Pendleton, Oregon
[41:01.080 --> 41:03.080]  It's actually one of the largest dispensaries
[41:03.080 --> 41:05.080]  In the nation we just don't really
[41:05.080 --> 41:07.080]  We're a very small rural area
[41:07.120 --> 41:09.120]  We carry 140 to 160
[41:09.120 --> 41:11.120]  Strains at any given time
[41:11.120 --> 41:13.120]  Staggering
[41:13.120 --> 41:15.120]  It's huge I strive to carry
[41:15.120 --> 41:17.120]  As many cannabis products
[41:17.120 --> 41:19.120]  And vendors cultivate
[41:19.120 --> 41:21.120]  Relationships meaningful vendor
[41:21.120 --> 41:23.120]  Relationships
[41:23.120 --> 41:25.120]  I've opened my store it's almost 6 years old
[41:25.120 --> 41:27.120]  I have about
[41:27.120 --> 41:29.120]  Over about 25
[41:29.120 --> 41:31.120]  Employees there at the dispensary
[41:31.120 --> 41:33.120]  I have
[41:33.120 --> 41:35.120]  Been in the cannabis industry for about
[41:35.160 --> 41:37.160]  Almost 15 years
[41:37.160 --> 41:39.160]  I started just doing it on the black
[41:39.160 --> 41:41.160]  Market it saved my life
[41:41.160 --> 41:43.160]  Because
[41:43.160 --> 41:45.160]  I just couldn't make it out there in the normal realm
[41:45.160 --> 41:47.160]  Right
[41:47.160 --> 41:49.160]  So that's kind of how I got in my start
[41:49.160 --> 41:51.160]  Well about 10 years ago my daughter
[41:51.160 --> 41:53.160]  Got diagnosed with leukemia
[41:53.160 --> 41:55.160]  And I cured
[41:55.160 --> 41:57.160]  Treated her cancer
[41:57.160 --> 41:59.160]  With cannabis oil
[41:59.160 --> 42:01.160]  I completely replaced her brain radiation
[42:01.160 --> 42:03.160]  With cannabis oil
[42:03.200 --> 42:05.200]  She's now almost 18 years old
[42:05.200 --> 42:07.200]  And she's been in remission
[42:07.200 --> 42:09.200]  For 11 years and she has
[42:09.200 --> 42:11.200]  A lower chance of secondary
[42:11.200 --> 42:13.200]  Cancers than any
[42:13.200 --> 42:15.200]  Child in her protocol
[42:15.200 --> 42:17.200]  Because of cannabis and they
[42:17.200 --> 42:19.200]  Admit that now so
[42:19.200 --> 42:21.200]  I still try to do a lot of activism
[42:21.200 --> 42:23.200]  In regards to pediatric cannabis therapy
[42:23.200 --> 42:25.200]  Because it's very important that we get this
[42:25.200 --> 42:27.200]  Federally legalized so that these
[42:27.200 --> 42:29.200]  Children no longer have to suffer
[42:29.200 --> 42:31.200]  And they can have safe
[42:31.240 --> 42:33.240]  Access to good quality medicine
[42:33.240 --> 42:35.240]  Which in turn
[42:35.240 --> 42:37.240]  Emphasizes the importance that you're
[42:37.240 --> 42:39.240]  Doing because the cannabis has to be grown
[42:39.240 --> 42:41.240]  Properly
[42:41.240 --> 42:43.240]  And as recreational continues
[42:43.240 --> 42:45.240]  To
[42:45.240 --> 42:47.240]  Grow and
[42:47.240 --> 42:49.240]  Spread across the states
[42:49.240 --> 42:51.240]  It's really imperative
[42:51.240 --> 42:53.240]  That people like us go
[42:53.240 --> 42:55.240]  And help
[42:55.240 --> 42:57.240]  That's why you mentioned moving to a new
[42:57.240 --> 42:59.240]  State and I just think it's great that you're going to get
[42:59.280 --> 43:01.280]  To spread your knowledge over there
[43:01.280 --> 43:03.280]  That's what I'm
[43:03.280 --> 43:05.280]  About
[43:05.280 --> 43:07.280]  That's amazing and again
[43:07.280 --> 43:09.280]  It's like each person that we meet
[43:09.280 --> 43:11.280]  That you can just see the passion
[43:11.280 --> 43:13.280]  For cannabis oozing from them has another
[43:13.280 --> 43:15.280]  Connection to
[43:15.280 --> 43:17.280]  A healing story, a story that cannabis
[43:17.280 --> 43:19.280]  Changed their life or somebody
[43:19.280 --> 43:21.280]  They're directly associated with
[43:21.280 --> 43:23.280]  I also know somebody that beat
[43:23.280 --> 43:25.280]  Leukemia and epilepsy
[43:25.280 --> 43:27.280]  With cannabis oil and it's just so
[43:27.320 --> 43:29.320]  Fascinating to me
[43:29.320 --> 43:31.320]  And heartwarming that
[43:31.320 --> 43:33.320]  We have this option now
[43:33.320 --> 43:35.320]  And we need to give it to more people
[43:35.320 --> 43:37.320]  Who don't feel like they have choices
[43:37.320 --> 43:39.320]  Or options or awareness
[43:39.320 --> 43:41.320]  And I think you're 100% right
[43:41.320 --> 43:43.320]  That it's the data and the
[43:43.320 --> 43:45.320]  Information and the science
[43:45.320 --> 43:47.320]  That are going to convince the people
[43:47.320 --> 43:49.320]  We need more science and more of the funding
[43:49.320 --> 43:51.320]  To go to
[43:51.320 --> 43:53.320]  Scientific research to collect this data
[43:53.320 --> 43:55.320]  Because different strains, different ratios
[43:55.360 --> 43:57.360]  Different terpenes are going to affect
[43:57.360 --> 43:59.360]  Medical conditions in different ways
[43:59.360 --> 44:01.360]  We just ignored cannabis
[44:01.360 --> 44:03.360]  With respect to research
[44:03.360 --> 44:05.360]  And data and information and I think that's really
[44:05.360 --> 44:07.360]  Unfair and there's a lot of anecdotal
[44:07.360 --> 44:09.360]  Research that we do on our own
[44:09.360 --> 44:11.360]  Bodies but we're being our own test
[44:11.360 --> 44:13.360]  Subjects and I think that we need
[44:13.360 --> 44:15.360]  To really have a more
[44:15.360 --> 44:17.360]  Yeah a more rigorous
[44:17.360 --> 44:19.360]  Way of collecting this information
[44:19.360 --> 44:21.360]  And bringing it to everybody
[44:21.360 --> 44:23.360]  Instead of having us all be our own guinea pigs
[44:23.400 --> 44:25.400]  That's one of the things is you have to try
[44:25.400 --> 44:27.400]  All these different ways before you
[44:27.400 --> 44:29.400]  Find the one that's yours but if we could use
[44:29.400 --> 44:31.400]  The data to streamline say
[44:31.400 --> 44:33.400]  I'm just going to filter through and say
[44:33.400 --> 44:35.400]  I'm going to try these 5 different ways instead of
[44:35.400 --> 44:37.400]  These 20 different ways because we can make ourselves sick
[44:37.400 --> 44:39.400]  Just trying to take different medicines
[44:39.400 --> 44:41.400]  Like that got me too high and that didn't work
[44:41.400 --> 44:43.400]  And that raised my blood pressure
[44:43.400 --> 44:45.400]  You know like let's dial it in
[44:45.400 --> 44:47.400]  We need to dial it in
[44:47.400 --> 44:49.400]  Also another important thing that you do
[44:49.400 --> 44:51.400]  With testing of the soil and identifying
[44:51.440 --> 44:53.440]  Proper areas to grow allows
[44:53.440 --> 44:55.440]  That strain to have its full potential
[44:55.440 --> 44:57.440]  When it becomes
[44:57.440 --> 44:59.440]  Medicine or even
[44:59.440 --> 45:01.440]  Recreational users
[45:01.440 --> 45:03.440]  They can't properly judge the cannabis
[45:03.440 --> 45:05.440]  Without that proper analytics
[45:05.440 --> 45:07.440]  The data, the proper
[45:07.440 --> 45:09.440]  Grow conditions and all of that
[45:09.440 --> 45:11.440]  Yeah like the regional specificity
[45:11.440 --> 45:13.440]  So one strain grown
[45:13.440 --> 45:15.440]  You know we're at the grow up
[45:15.440 --> 45:17.440]  This is a perfect example you take one cultivar
[45:17.440 --> 45:19.440]  And you spread it across the land
[45:19.480 --> 45:21.480]  And you put it under many different conditions
[45:21.480 --> 45:23.480]  And it expresses itself different
[45:23.480 --> 45:25.480]  Because of the epigenetic factors
[45:25.480 --> 45:27.480]  And what it was exposed to
[45:27.480 --> 45:29.480]  And so just because this one cultivar works
[45:29.480 --> 45:31.480]  For this person
[45:31.480 --> 45:33.480]  If it's grown somewhere else
[45:33.480 --> 45:35.480]  It might not work for that person anymore
[45:35.480 --> 45:37.480]  It might not be the same thing
[45:37.480 --> 45:39.480]  The same thing might not come out
[45:39.480 --> 45:41.480]  So regional specificity
[45:41.480 --> 45:43.480]  And where each of these cultivars grow best
[45:43.480 --> 45:45.480]  And then standardizing that and say
[45:45.480 --> 45:47.480]  This is the climatic conditions this grows in
[45:47.520 --> 45:49.520]  And then we can have a consistency
[45:49.520 --> 45:51.520]  Of that profile we're looking for
[45:51.520 --> 45:53.520]  So does that tie in with such a robust
[45:53.520 --> 45:55.520]  Offering at your dispensary
[45:55.520 --> 45:57.520]  So many genetics
[45:57.520 --> 45:59.520]  Are you seeing like
[45:59.520 --> 46:01.520]  Oh well I've got some OG Kush
[46:01.520 --> 46:03.520]  From you know Portland area
[46:03.520 --> 46:05.520]  But I'm seeing this down from like
[46:05.520 --> 46:07.520]  Willamette Valley
[46:07.520 --> 46:09.520]  Or you know down in the Rogue River
[46:09.520 --> 46:11.520]  This is an OG and it's got different expressions
[46:11.520 --> 46:13.520]  So I'm going to bring that in the future
[46:13.520 --> 46:15.520]  Even though I've got an OG
[46:15.560 --> 46:17.560]  Or do you curate in that way
[46:17.560 --> 46:19.560]  Or do you try to have a wider variety of genetics
[46:19.560 --> 46:21.560]  Or how do you kind of select
[46:21.560 --> 46:23.560]  With such a huge variety
[46:23.560 --> 46:25.560]  How to feature those concepts
[46:25.560 --> 46:27.560]  Each
[46:27.560 --> 46:29.560]  So honestly
[46:29.560 --> 46:31.560]  And the strain
[46:31.560 --> 46:33.560]  It could be different
[46:33.560 --> 46:35.560]  Whoever cultivates the strain
[46:35.560 --> 46:37.560]  So it's absolutely
[46:37.560 --> 46:39.560]  And we have a little
[46:39.560 --> 46:41.560]  On each of our jars we put the state of Oregon
[46:41.560 --> 46:43.560]  And we put a dot where it's grown at
[46:43.600 --> 46:45.600]  So people can see
[46:45.600 --> 46:47.600]  Where the weed is grown at
[46:47.600 --> 46:49.600]  And we do find that customers
[46:49.600 --> 46:51.600]  Come in looking for cannabis grown
[46:51.600 --> 46:53.600]  Especially from southern Oregon
[46:53.600 --> 46:55.600]  They tend to
[46:55.600 --> 46:57.600]  Like that
[46:57.600 --> 46:59.600]  So one thing I'm very
[46:59.600 --> 47:01.600]  Passionate about is compliance
[47:01.600 --> 47:03.600]  Because I feel like we need to be compliant
[47:03.600 --> 47:05.600]  In order to
[47:05.600 --> 47:07.600]  Help grow
[47:07.600 --> 47:09.600]  Both the recreational
[47:09.600 --> 47:11.600]  And the medical industry
[47:11.640 --> 47:13.640]  And what I am finding
[47:13.640 --> 47:15.640]  Is that a lot of growers
[47:15.640 --> 47:17.640]  Are not compliant
[47:17.640 --> 47:19.640]  In the terms of just change the strain names
[47:19.640 --> 47:21.640]  And that's kind of a frustration to me
[47:21.640 --> 47:23.640]  As a dispensary owner
[47:23.640 --> 47:25.640]  And also
[47:25.640 --> 47:27.640]  As somebody who helps medical patients
[47:27.640 --> 47:29.640]  It's crucial that we don't just change the strain names
[47:29.640 --> 47:31.640]  As a consumer
[47:31.640 --> 47:33.640]  And a connoisseur
[47:33.640 --> 47:35.640]  I completely agree
[47:35.640 --> 47:37.640]  I feel like it's pirating other people's work
[47:37.640 --> 47:39.640]  And you know
[47:39.680 --> 47:41.680]  And you might know a little more about this too
[47:41.680 --> 47:43.680]  There's a really cool program called Canopy Right
[47:43.680 --> 47:45.680]  And some really cool individuals working on
[47:45.680 --> 47:47.680]  Ways to identify
[47:47.680 --> 47:49.680]  Isolate
[47:49.680 --> 47:51.680]  And
[47:51.680 --> 47:53.680]  Track genetics
[47:53.680 --> 47:55.680]  And so you can take a genetic
[47:55.680 --> 47:57.680]  Sample, freeze it
[47:57.680 --> 47:59.680]  Send it in to them
[47:59.680 --> 48:01.680]  They catalog it
[48:01.680 --> 48:03.680]  And you have kind of this proprietary
[48:03.680 --> 48:05.680]  Blockchain link
[48:05.680 --> 48:07.680]  And I'm not doing it justice people
[48:07.720 --> 48:09.720]  But check out Canopy Right
[48:09.720 --> 48:11.720]  Because it's really cool
[48:11.720 --> 48:13.720]  And it's actually even easier than that
[48:13.720 --> 48:15.720]  You don't send it in to them
[48:15.720 --> 48:17.720]  They don't host it for you
[48:17.720 --> 48:19.720]  You just put it in your freezer yourself
[48:19.720 --> 48:21.720]  And all that is is proof that you own it
[48:21.720 --> 48:23.720]  And the blockchain is a notary
[48:23.720 --> 48:25.720]  So the blockchain says
[48:25.720 --> 48:27.720]  I declare on this day at this time
[48:27.720 --> 48:29.720]  That I am in possession and ownership
[48:29.720 --> 48:31.720]  Of this cultivar
[48:31.720 --> 48:33.720]  And then you put the proof
[48:33.720 --> 48:35.720]  The genetic proof in your freezer
[48:35.760 --> 48:37.760]  And you say I prove provenance
[48:37.760 --> 48:39.760]  Because at this date at this time
[48:39.760 --> 48:41.760]  The blockchain notarized that it's mine
[48:41.760 --> 48:43.760]  And then you can take that and say
[48:43.760 --> 48:45.760]  Through that ownership
[48:45.760 --> 48:47.760]  You can license out your strain to different people
[48:47.760 --> 48:49.760]  And you can say I only want to license
[48:49.760 --> 48:51.760]  This strain out to locations
[48:51.760 --> 48:53.760]  That are going to grow it like I grow it
[48:53.760 --> 48:55.760]  And that have the same climatic conditions as me
[48:55.760 --> 48:57.760]  So you can set your preferences
[48:57.760 --> 48:59.760]  And say who do I want to grow this
[48:59.760 --> 49:01.760]  And what do I want it grown for
[49:01.760 --> 49:03.760]  And then you can make deals with people
[49:03.800 --> 49:05.800]  Because what they do is they put all this information
[49:05.800 --> 49:07.800]  Onto an app
[49:07.800 --> 49:09.800]  And that app can be filtered
[49:09.800 --> 49:11.800]  So you can say show me all of the buds
[49:11.800 --> 49:13.800]  That are purple and high CBD
[49:13.800 --> 49:15.800]  And are grown in Humboldt County
[49:15.800 --> 49:17.800]  Or grown in Colorado
[49:17.800 --> 49:19.800]  And whatever other
[49:19.800 --> 49:21.800]  I want auto flower, I want feminized
[49:21.800 --> 49:23.800]  So it will filter all of those out for you
[49:23.800 --> 49:25.800]  And say okay you can talk to these five breeders
[49:25.800 --> 49:27.800]  Because they fit those parameters
[49:27.800 --> 49:29.800]  And then you can go find them
[49:29.800 --> 49:31.800]  And find your medicine more easily
[49:31.840 --> 49:33.840]  So it's a sea of people
[49:33.840 --> 49:35.840]  And strains
[49:35.840 --> 49:37.840]  And then the blockchain stamps proof
[49:37.840 --> 49:39.840]  That says this is the strain
[49:39.840 --> 49:41.840]  This is the cultivar
[49:41.840 --> 49:43.840]  And so no one can take that and change the name
[49:43.840 --> 49:45.840]  Lest we run a genetic profile on it
[49:45.840 --> 49:47.840]  And find out it's the same one
[49:47.840 --> 49:49.840]  That is owned by someone
[49:49.840 --> 49:51.840]  Now you're in trouble
[49:51.840 --> 49:53.840]  And we're at a place now where we can actually
[49:53.840 --> 49:55.840]  Have legal ramifications for that
[49:55.840 --> 49:57.840]  That makes a lot of sense as far as keeping that consistency
[49:57.840 --> 49:59.840]  That is needed
[49:59.880 --> 50:01.880]  And if you can have the same cultivar
[50:01.880 --> 50:03.880]  But grown in different areas
[50:03.880 --> 50:05.880]  And offer different medicinal reactions
[50:05.880 --> 50:07.880]  On each individual
[50:07.880 --> 50:09.880]  That seems like a pretty clear
[50:09.880 --> 50:11.880]  And wonderful path forward
[50:11.880 --> 50:13.880]  To try to keep some consistency
[50:13.880 --> 50:15.880]  And I think it will help with industry standards
[50:15.880 --> 50:17.880]  It's another issue that we have
[50:17.880 --> 50:19.880]  Is there's no standardization
[50:19.880 --> 50:21.880]  People just kind of do whatever, slap a name on it
[50:21.880 --> 50:23.880]  As long as it looks good and tastes good
[50:23.880 --> 50:25.880]  Then they can kind of get away with it
[50:25.880 --> 50:27.880]  But when we start actually mapping this out
[50:27.920 --> 50:29.920]  And we start to see that in our products
[50:29.920 --> 50:31.920]  They don't play like that
[50:31.920 --> 50:33.920]  This is a Macintosh apple
[50:33.920 --> 50:35.920]  And anything else is not a Macintosh apple
[50:35.920 --> 50:37.920]  And this was created by this person
[50:37.920 --> 50:39.920]  And that's that
[50:39.920 --> 50:41.920]  You can't be like
[50:41.920 --> 50:43.920]  Oh these Cabernet grapes aren't really selling
[50:43.920 --> 50:45.920]  These are Pinot now
[50:45.920 --> 50:47.920]  You can't get away with that in the grape industry
[50:47.920 --> 50:49.920]  And you shouldn't be able to in the cannabis industry
[50:49.920 --> 50:51.920]  But we're so new and young that it hasn't been developed yet
[50:51.920 --> 50:53.920]  But that's where we need to go
[50:53.920 --> 50:55.920]  So we need to take it
[50:55.960 --> 50:57.960]  And I think that when you're at the dispensary
[50:57.960 --> 50:59.960]  You're very clear about exactly what it is
[50:59.960 --> 51:01.960]  And it's true and correct
[51:01.960 --> 51:03.960]  I'm very excited to see where the science goes
[51:03.960 --> 51:05.960]  And watch your progression
[51:05.960 --> 51:07.960]  Through the years
[51:07.960 --> 51:09.960]  Because it's about to get busy
[51:09.960 --> 51:11.960]  Absolutely
[51:11.960 --> 51:13.960]  And a lot of people are in despair right now
[51:13.960 --> 51:15.960]  Because the industry is crashing
[51:15.960 --> 51:17.960]  The industry is failing
[51:17.960 --> 51:19.960]  But the industry is just changing
[51:19.960 --> 51:21.960]  And it's changing in a way it really needs to
[51:21.960 --> 51:23.960]  And so although it feels challenging
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  On the other side is a way better cannabis industry
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  It's going to be strong
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  And we're going to be able to compete
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  With the rest of the world
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  The rest of the agrodoms
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  Thank you so much for having me on
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  I need to go get a drink
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  Thanks so much for joining us
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  We appreciate you both
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  Thank you so much
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  If we find Jeff
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  From Canopy Right
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  I'd like to sit down and have more of that conversation
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  If he's here let's get Jeff back up
[51:52.040 --> 51:54.040]  Oh yeah
[51:54.040 --> 51:56.040]  SBC Jeff
[51:56.040 --> 51:58.040]  No different Jeff
[51:58.040 --> 52:04.000]  Different Jeff
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  Let's photo
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  Oh yeah

[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.780]  You can turn it off.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:00.780]  I'm not going to do it.
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:03.780]  Rizky told me.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.780]  Peter, you got to go back to the
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.780]  No-Till Hank Hill Pelican case.
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.780]  One guy?
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.780]  So this is like,
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:20.620]  this is the first time I've seen this.
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:23.620]  If you haven't heard of Pied Piper,
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:26.620]  he's from Florida.
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:29.620]  Oh yeah, I know him.
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:32.620]  Hello.
[01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:35.620]  How about you?
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.620]  When do I get to eat, Peter?
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:48.080]  Yeah.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.080]  I hope you have lots of money going on.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.610]  I'm going to have to go to the bank.
[01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:59.610]  I hope you have lots of money going on.
[01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:20.260]  This dude's from Japan.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.260]  He's been living in LA for four years.
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:26.260]  Threw down some heat tonight.
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:29.340]  That's the dude who grew it.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.340]  Otis, what do you think of the black run?
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.200]  You did a great job.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.600]  It's got a lot of flavor.
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:37.640]  The smoke's nice.
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:39.880]  Enjoyable as hell.
[01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:40.580]  You want to take a hit?
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:42.220]  Hell yeah.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:42.720]  Yeah.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.620]  I rolled a nice fatty of it.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:48.420]  Pretty much maxed out, maxed out the one and a quarter element.
[01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:51.060]  So, you know, we're getting some flavors out of it.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:51.780]  That's for sure.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.580]  The papers are too small.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:57.420]  What is this?
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.420]  I'm shaking like a shaking young man.
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:00.420]  Can I hit it again?
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:01.420]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.420]  My God, no one wants it.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.420]  It's yours, right?
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:05.420]  Yeah.
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.420]  Ah, that might be mine.
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:11.420]  I would say this one's mine and that one's yours.
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:14.420]  You guys can watch the video after and figure it out.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:15.420]  Ha ha ha ha.
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:20.420]  We got some chai to keep us warm.
[01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:24.420]  As we're making kebabs.
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:33.900]  I don't have that much.
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.900]  The RS11 is pretty good.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:38.900]  I think everything that he makes is on point.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:39.900]  Let's get you a new one.
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:41.900]  I saw the RS11.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:43.900]  It's like a white one.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:44.900]  Yeah.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:45.900]  It's a lot of flavor.
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:50.900]  I know that guy probably back when the high time shows.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:51.900]  Do you remember?
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:52.900]  Like, it was a lot of years ago?
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:53.900]  Yeah.
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:55.900]  How's it going?
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:56.900]  So what are we cooking up tonight?
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:01.060]  Just a little bit of chicken, a little bit of lamb, some veggies.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:02.060]  You know, the usual.
[01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:06.060]  Nothing too crazy, but you know, for FCP, we got to do it right.
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:10.060]  And you braved the torrential rains last week.
[01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.060]  Oh man, last week was the rain.
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.060]  That was fun.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:16.060]  This is what kept everyone warm last week in the rain.
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.060]  And you guys came up from San Diego?
[01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:25.060]  Yeah.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:29.640]  Yeah, we went to Alabama.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.640]  We like went to the South Side.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.640]  Yeah?
[01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:34.640]  Yeah.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.640]  There's Trinity County.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.640]  Judy.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.640]  Soul Spirit Farm.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640]  We brought her mom.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.640]  Judy.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.640]  Judy's mom.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.640]  We're trying to get to do a dab.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:55.800]  I'm almost done.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.800]  We have not yet committed to do that.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.800]  Can we get that on video?
[01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:16.610]  Judy, what's that one?
[01:08:17.610 --> 01:08:18.610]  What?
[01:08:18.610 --> 01:08:19.610]  The Burmese Mimosa.
[01:08:19.610 --> 01:08:20.610]  Burmese Mimosa.
[01:08:20.610 --> 01:08:21.610]  Our favorite ever weed.
[01:08:26.610 --> 01:08:28.610]  I think these guys are about ready to roll.
[01:08:30.610 --> 01:08:31.610]  Who's ready to roll?
[01:08:32.610 --> 01:08:33.610]  The guys that drove in here.
[01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:34.770]  Why don't they leave it?
[01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:36.770]  You're not going to stick around for the awards?
[01:08:37.770 --> 01:08:38.770]  They're not doing California.
[01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:41.770]  Oh yeah, so you're like, get me the fuck out of here.
[01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:43.770]  I was like you.
[01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:45.770]  Get me out of here.
[01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:49.770]  So you'll need to rock the mic.
[01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:50.770]  Yeah, we have our lapels, but.
[01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:52.770]  Oh, rock a mic?
[01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:53.770]  Rock the mic.
[01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:57.770]  Spreading light like a prism.
[01:08:57.770 --> 01:08:58.770]  Nobody else is coming in, alright.
[01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:00.770]  I thought.
[01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:02.770]  Yeah, I mean maybe Sam will come in.
[01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:05.770]  Or Kev-o.
[01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:07.770]  Kev.
[01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:11.230]  Kev.
[01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:13.230]  He's coming.
[01:09:16.230 --> 01:09:17.230]  Come on in my friend.
[01:09:18.230 --> 01:09:19.230]  Do I need the mic?
[01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:20.230]  I'm so fucking loud anyway.
[01:09:21.230 --> 01:09:22.230]  You'll need the mic.
[01:09:23.230 --> 01:09:24.230]  Last time that I think.
[01:09:25.230 --> 01:09:26.230]  Get the mic for your face.
[01:09:26.230 --> 01:09:27.230]  Yes.
[01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:30.230]  You'll need it at least like, you know, comfortable ready.
[01:09:30.230 --> 01:09:31.230]  You are, you got the power voice.
[01:09:32.230 --> 01:09:33.230]  I'm having a kind of single right now, dude.
[01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:34.390]  My holiday album.
[01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:36.390]  2023.
[01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:37.390]  Here we go.
[01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:38.390]  Right.
[01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:41.390]  You good?
[01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:43.390]  We are live again.
[01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:47.390]  Once again, Grow Off 2022 Mega Awards.
[01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:52.390]  We are joined by some familiar faces and family friends.
[01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:54.390]  We're super excited to have Kevin.
[01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:58.390]  Earth Juice, Green Force Genetics, longtime cultivator, breeder.
[01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:02.390]  You know, deep rooted cannabis personality.
[01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:04.390]  That's nice.
[01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:12.390]  And Craig from Talking Trees, Satori and so many other fantastic businesses.
[01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:15.390]  What's the distribution?
[01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:17.390]  High grade distribution.
[01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:20.390]  I kept wanting to say higher ground and I knew better.
[01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:28.390]  But you know, people that have joined us on Royal Groom Radio, people that have been deep industry influencers and Grow Off participants for years.
[01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:30.390]  Welcome guys.
[01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:32.390]  Appreciate it.
[01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:33.550]  Hello.
[01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:35.550]  Woo.
[01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:39.550]  Craig is fantastic enough to have brought some pre-rolls.
[01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:44.550]  So I'm going to let him tell you what this is because I don't even know, but I know I'm going to enjoy it.
[01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:47.550]  Actually, I don't even know what it is.
[01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:50.550]  The bag says rainbow jelly.
[01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:52.550]  So I'm guessing it has rainbow belts.
[01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:55.550]  It's going to be super heavy in Skittles terms.
[01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:58.550]  I think the jelly might be Jelly Mac.
[01:10:58.710 --> 01:10:59.710]  Okay.
[01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:03.710]  So I get 10 of every pre-roll that's going to come to market.
[01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:06.710]  Like in bulk before it comes out just to pre-test it.
[01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:11.710]  So we're doing some R&D work here on a product that's going to come to market.
[01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:14.710]  What do you think?
[01:11:15.710 --> 01:11:18.710]  I love research and development because this is fantastic.
[01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:24.710]  It does have that Skittle forward, but it's got a little bit like less gassy back.
[01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:25.870]  Maybe a little sweeter.
[01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:29.870]  Like you're saying that jelly is like tongue forward.
[01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:32.870]  I like that.
[01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:34.870]  But it's got turps.
[01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:36.870]  It's got turps.
[01:11:37.870 --> 01:11:38.870]  I was kind of impressed.
[01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:41.870]  It's a pre-roll and it has turps.
[01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:43.870]  Take that to the bank.
[01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:46.870]  Yeah.
[01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:49.870]  So is this coming off of the Humboldt farm?
[01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:51.870]  Right on.
[01:11:52.030 --> 01:12:03.030]  So for those of you who don't know, Talking Trees is a wide variety of full sun, greenhouse, indoor varieties out of Northern California.
[01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:05.030]  Top quality cannabis.
[01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:07.030]  Organically grown.
[01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:09.030]  A ton of earth juice products.
[01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:11.030]  A ton of living soil techniques.
[01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:14.030]  Sugars over salts, baby.
[01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.030]  Royal gold for years.
[01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:18.030]  Yeah.
[01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:20.030]  Craig is pushing a campaign.
[01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:21.190]  He wants to talk about it today.
[01:12:22.190 --> 01:12:23.190]  He handed you that sticker there.
[01:12:24.190 --> 01:12:25.190]  That's the campaign sign for your lawn.
[01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:27.190]  Your front lawn.
[01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:29.190]  Every mini fridge.
[01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:31.190]  Sugars over salts.
[01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:33.190]  Sugars over salts.
[01:12:34.190 --> 01:12:35.190]  So tell us about the campaign then.
[01:12:36.190 --> 01:12:44.190]  I mean, I just believe you get a superior smoking power when you feed it with more sugars than salts.
[01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:50.350]  And so most of the nutrients out there these days are salt-based.
[01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:53.350]  Grown for, made for hydro production.
[01:12:54.350 --> 01:13:05.350]  And I just believe that you're going to always get a better quality smoking, higher terpene, better high out of something that's grown in soil with organic inputs.
[01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:13.350]  Which leads to using more sugars than salts because you're using compost teas and you're adding molasses.
[01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:15.350]  Or sucrose.
[01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:23.350]  Anything that is a terp enhancing product has a sugar derivative, a complex carbohydrate involved in it.
[01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:26.350]  So I'm all about sugars over salts.
[01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:35.350]  It makes total sense because you're feeding the soil, you're feeding the microbes, you're feeding the systems that the plant interacts with to get its food.
[01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:42.350]  As opposed to just, you know, nobody wants to live on like synthetic nutrient goop.
[01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:45.510]  Like you want to experience the flavors.
[01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:49.510]  You want to be able to choose, hey, I feel like I need more vegetables today.
[01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:51.510]  I feel like I need more protein today.
[01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:56.510]  So that's what the living soil concept is, right?
[01:13:57.510 --> 01:14:01.510]  It's giving the plant a wide variety of organic matter to break down.
[01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:07.510]  A wide variety of biology to interact with the plant.
[01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:12.670]  And so it's a healthier, happier plant and can live its true expression, right?
[01:14:13.670 --> 01:14:15.670]  Well, it's planted healthier too.
[01:14:16.670 --> 01:14:23.670]  All this runoff, all this soil work, everything going back in, you're able to get back out and get the fruits of the labor.
[01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:25.670]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:29.670]  Working with Earth Juice, you've seen it for years.
[01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:44.830]  Earth Juice was one of the first products really to start pushing a lot of these concepts in easily available, ready to use bottles and dry products that you could buy, take home and kind of integrate these concepts of living soil.
[01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:46.830]  100%.
[01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:48.830]  A lot of our products are made to integrate with living soil.
[01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:50.830]  Natural, you know what I mean?
[01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:52.830]  Good for the environment, good for us.
[01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:54.830]  You know, we're all inhaling this, we're all smoking this.
[01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:58.990]  The last thing we want to do is create other problems when we're trying to fix one or two.
[01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:06.990]  So I always believe in the healthy side of life, always believe in the natural side of life, always believe solid soil grows a solid plant.
[01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:09.990]  Final product always speaks for itself.
[01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:12.990]  And I think that's one of the coolest things about the grow-off.
[01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:16.990]  And I know you guys have all kind of seen and experienced the grow-off too.
[01:15:17.150 --> 01:15:25.150]  Oftentimes the winners are these sun-grown, organic, like Jay from Fenerio, right?
[01:15:26.150 --> 01:15:27.150]  You guys met at the last grow-off up in...
[01:15:28.150 --> 01:15:29.150]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:32.150]  Yeah, he swept, right? Didn't he take three of the awards?
[01:15:33.150 --> 01:15:34.150]  I think so, yeah.
[01:15:35.150 --> 01:15:46.150]  I mean, I think it's any grower that's grown and does mix the atmosphere grows, indoor, mix like outdoor, the results are obvious.
[01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:55.150]  I mean, outdoor is most superior, unless you have the ultimate control on your mix like, that could be superior.
[01:15:56.150 --> 01:16:05.150]  But unfortunately, you're not going to get the highest turfs, the highest potency out of indoor cannabis compared to sun-grown.
[01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:14.150]  And people that do it on the same property, and I can think of a few farmers that I'm not going to throw their names out that can justify that, is that...
[01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:16.310]  Yeah, the sun is special.
[01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:18.310]  It really is.
[01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:26.310]  It's more special than PG&E, or whatever fucking artificial light controlled atmosphere you're using.
[01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:35.310]  Yeah, and the microclimates create unique profiles as well, where you can replicate indoor the same way anywhere.
[01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:38.310]  It can be very homogenous, right?
[01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:46.470]  You can't get that unique like, what comes off of that, the side of that Willow Creek Hill is unique, even from across the valley.
[01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:48.470]  Yeah.
[01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:56.470]  So, right now I'm bubbling on the topic of, even for indoor, dude, Appalachians matter.
[01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:58.470]  Like, they're different.
[01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:04.470]  Like, indoor in Colorado is different than indoor on the Humboldt Coast.
[01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:06.470]  Like, indoor is not indoor.
[01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:09.630]  Because you're always battling outside factors.
[01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:20.630]  And the amount of energy you have to use for climate control versus AC versus heat versus humidification, it's never...
[01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:24.630]  Like, there's Appalachians too indoor, you know?
[01:17:25.630 --> 01:17:26.630]  And so it's like, no indoor is equal.
[01:17:27.630 --> 01:17:29.630]  Like, no indoor is level playing field.
[01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:32.630]  Indoor is different from where it's grown.
[01:17:33.630 --> 01:17:34.630]  That's true.
[01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:35.790]  It's a good point.
[01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:37.790]  I'm just throwing that out there.
[01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:43.790]  I think that's very important because I never really thought about it like that.
[01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:45.790]  I was just saying the opposite.
[01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:58.790]  But at 5,000 feet elevation or 7,000 feet elevation or sea level, the air is thinner, the components are different, the nitrogen, the carbon, the oxygen, all of that stuff is different.
[01:17:58.950 --> 01:18:05.950]  Which means you're adding so many different elements to try to control that environment to peak performance.
[01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:10.950]  But all those different elements on a scale have a different impact on that harvest.
[01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:14.950]  And in Colorado, right, you're super dry.
[01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:16.950]  You need...
[01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:20.950]  I don't want to get market specific, but like...
[01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:22.950]  Sure.
[01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:27.950]  There's so many differences that indoor isn't just indoor no matter where it's grown.
[01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:36.950]  I really hope... I just ran into some guys from Colorado who actually had the best indoor from Colorado that I've seen in probably 20 years.
[01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:41.950]  And I'm hoping those guys make it back over, but they had like 15 different flavors.
[01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:44.950]  The turps were unique and fantastic for each.
[01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:47.950]  And it's something that I don't really see as much.
[01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:49.950]  Personally, I don't live in Colorado.
[01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:57.950]  I have a limited view, but it's harder to really get proper expression in certain places based on certain environments.
[01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:59.950]  I saw some Michiganders earlier.
[01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:01.950]  Well, yeah, dude.
[01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:10.950]  That's why, unfortunately, you're still going to get superior indoor on the California coast than Colorado.
[01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:12.950]  Because why?
[01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:17.950]  Our temperate temperatures, our temperate humidity.
[01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:25.950]  We don't deal with the fluctuations that somewhere that is 8,000, 5,000 feet above elevation.
[01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:27.110]  Sorry, Colorado.
[01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:31.110]  We just have a better atmosphere to start with.
[01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:37.110]  And then you have to play off the atmospheric conditions.
[01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:44.110]  But we're served a much better atmospheric condition to start from.
[01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:47.110]  And so I think it always is going to come out and be quite a product.
[01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:52.110]  And that goes for Oklahoma where it's hot, swampy, humid.
[01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:53.270]  You know, I mean.
[01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:55.270]  Yeah.
[01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:57.270]  A lot of places just have a shorter growth.
[01:19:58.270 --> 01:20:02.270]  There's a reason why Humboldt and California have always been the mecca for cannabis.
[01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:08.270]  Not only politically, socially, economically, but climate is huge too.
[01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:10.270]  It really is.
[01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:16.270]  Moving forward, it's more huge than all those other milestones that we built this industry on.
[01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:18.270]  Yeah, no doubt.
[01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:24.430]  Well, I think it's represented by the biodiversity that naturally exists in those regions.
[01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:26.430]  Right?
[01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:29.430]  Look, it's a temperate rain forest in Northern California.
[01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:35.430]  Huge species diversification, huge density of biodiversity.
[01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:37.430]  Like in the canopy, right?
[01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:39.430]  You've got 300 foot tall trees.
[01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:43.430]  There's biology 300 feet from the surface of the earth.
[01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:46.430]  And you just don't have that in some of these other places.
[01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:51.590]  And to be fair, you know, we're talking about that specifically.
[01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:56.590]  Like we should lump in Southern Oregon because they do have some of those.
[01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:58.590]  They very much do.
[01:20:59.590 --> 01:21:02.590]  Like they have the same amazing little microclimates.
[01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:04.590]  State of Jefferson.
[01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:06.590]  It really is.
[01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:08.590]  It's special.
[01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:10.590]  Well, Applegate's special.
[01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:13.590]  You know, it's one of those other special places for sure.
[01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:17.750]  I just went up to a harvest party on Saturday at Cave Junction.
[01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:19.750]  And it was great.
[01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:23.750]  It was a great mix of actual people from Southern Oregon and Emerald Triangle.
[01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:25.750]  And even beyond.
[01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:29.750]  There was a couple people from Arizona, a couple people from Calaveras County.
[01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:34.750]  And it was a really awesome little cultural event out in Cave Junction.
[01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:38.750]  Super cannabis, you know, heavy on all levels.
[01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:40.750]  More of almost a farmer's market.
[01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:45.910]  And like show your goods, what you grew this year, what you're going to do,
[01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:49.910]  what you're going to try to do next year, communicate with your neighbors.
[01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:53.910]  Whether you'd be the same person on the road or the person down in Humboldt County.
[01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:55.910]  To be like, oh, we're not that different.
[01:21:56.910 --> 01:22:00.910]  There's always been kind of a love-hate relationship in Southern Oregon and Emerald Triangle, you know.
[01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:07.910]  And it was a really beautifying unity making moment between growers.
[01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:12.070]  The takeaway was like, wow, this is really nice.
[01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:17.070]  Moving into where we're going, where the enemy isn't a grower in Southern Oregon
[01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:19.070]  when you're in Humboldt or vice versa.
[01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:25.070]  Or out in Calaveras County or out even in fucking Colorado, per se.
[01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:31.070]  When you're a craft cannabis grower, your only competition is really big corporate.
[01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:35.070]  Not the other cannabis grower up the road or the next state over.
[01:22:35.230 --> 01:22:37.230]  And it was a really beautiful understanding.
[01:22:38.230 --> 01:22:43.230]  One of the better events I've gone to in a while.
[01:22:44.230 --> 01:22:46.230]  They have a key community in Southern Oregon.
[01:22:47.230 --> 01:22:48.230]  That's one thing we see in the cannabis industry.
[01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:51.230]  It seems like our communities are starting to dwindle a little bit.
[01:22:52.230 --> 01:22:53.230]  But Southern Oregon has kept it strong.
[01:22:54.230 --> 01:22:55.230]  They're a united bunch of growers.
[01:22:56.230 --> 01:22:57.230]  They stand for something. They do good work.
[01:22:58.230 --> 01:23:00.230]  They're good people. And they just keep cracking on as strong as can be.
[01:23:01.230 --> 01:23:02.230]  And you've got to admire that.
[01:23:03.230 --> 01:23:04.230]  You've got to give a hats off.
[01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.230]  Yeah.
[01:23:07.230 --> 01:23:08.230]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:23:09.230 --> 01:23:14.230]  So, what are you guys most excited about for this year's Grow Off Award Ceremony?
[01:23:15.230 --> 01:23:16.230]  For the Mega Awards?
[01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:18.230]  I know it's bittersweet.
[01:23:19.230 --> 01:23:21.230]  California, we're not getting any information here.
[01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:23.230]  But we get to have our own private party.
[01:23:24.230 --> 01:23:25.230]  So we'll see you in a couple of months.
[01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:27.230]  I love that you're here.
[01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:32.230]  It works out. I showed up thinking, oh, we're going to have a drum roll California.
[01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:35.390]  But I guess California, results aren't in.
[01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:37.390]  So there's seven other states.
[01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:39.390]  Pretty impressive.
[01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:41.390]  Yeah.
[01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:43.390]  Or regions.
[01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:45.390]  I think what Sam was saying was because outdoor, you know, California.
[01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:48.390]  It's going to be interesting to hear what's going on in other markets.
[01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:51.390]  And, you know, hear what the winners have to say.
[01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:54.390]  And see the different genetics coming out of different states.
[01:23:55.390 --> 01:24:01.390]  I mean, the Grow Off, I think it's like a fun, it's a really fun competition just because of the variety of cannabis.
[01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:05.390]  Because it's like a level playing field.
[01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:07.390]  Everybody's getting the same thing.
[01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:09.390]  It's based on results.
[01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:12.390]  It's a, it's pretty fun.
[01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:14.390]  Yeah.
[01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:16.390]  Yeah, I'm really interested.
[01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:21.390]  This is the first award ceremony for other states besides California that I've gotten to do.
[01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:27.390]  So I'm really, yeah, just kind of hyped to see what other people have and these other genetics.
[01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:33.550]  As somebody who's into breeding, what have you seen for the genetics that come out of the Grow Off in the past?
[01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:35.550]  Oh, I like the genetics.
[01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:37.550]  It's always been solid.
[01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:39.550]  Everything's been well maintained and planned.
[01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:41.550]  And everyone's growing good stuff.
[01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:46.550]  I like seeing, I like seeing the diversity of the genetics through multiple states, multiple areas, even multiple regions.
[01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:48.550]  You know what I mean?
[01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:51.550]  That's what we were talking about earlier, microclimates and things in that respect.
[01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:55.550]  You know, 10 different growers can make the same plant look 10 different ways.
[01:24:55.710 --> 01:24:56.710]  And that always intrigues me.
[01:24:57.710 --> 01:25:02.710]  I'm always very curious to see the different terpenes, the different look, the different smell, the different everything.
[01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:04.710]  That literally comes off of the same cut.
[01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:06.710]  Right.
[01:25:07.710 --> 01:25:12.710]  You know, so many styles of growing produce so many different things that to me, it's always amazing to see what people do with one thing.
[01:25:13.710 --> 01:25:14.710]  No doubt.
[01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:20.710]  I think that's what this, this event shows more than anything is, you know, the diversity in one cut.
[01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:26.870]  Not one pack of seeds, not 20 different armies, one cut being expressed in 20 different ways.
[01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:28.870]  I think it's pretty amazing.
[01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:35.870]  Man, what surprises me the most, I think, is the structure and appearance differences.
[01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:42.870]  Like there's some variation in terpene profiles and in flavor and potency and all that.
[01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:48.870]  But the structure, it's just so radically different in so many different environments.
[01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:52.030]  And that, I think, comes down to the microclimates, indoor and outdoor.
[01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:56.030]  Right. Light density and fertilization.
[01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:58.030]  Well, they're with us.
[01:25:59.030 --> 01:26:00.030]  Everything shows a different expression.
[01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:05.030]  Their poster that they come out with at the end of every competition.
[01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:14.030]  I mean, it's pretty wildly all over the place when you see a combination of 30, 40 different contestants winning.
[01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:19.190]  I mean, we were just in Hawaii when we were doing their medical competition out there.
[01:26:20.190 --> 01:26:24.190]  And I had the poster on my booth and my table where I would set up.
[01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:26.190]  And that was the question of the day.
[01:26:27.190 --> 01:26:32.190]  Because everybody came up and they just couldn't wrap their heads around the idea that that was the same.
[01:26:33.190 --> 01:26:34.190]  They'd be like, I thought this was the same strain.
[01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:36.190]  I'm like, it is.
[01:26:37.190 --> 01:26:38.190]  And this is what happens.
[01:26:39.190 --> 01:26:42.190]  This is literally what happens when different people in different areas,
[01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:46.350]  with different styles, grow the same amazing plant.
[01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:48.350]  Totally different expression.
[01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:50.350]  We see it all the time.
[01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:54.350]  Yeah.
[01:26:58.350 --> 01:27:01.350]  Well, whatever that was that he lit up, it works.
[01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:03.350]  It works, people.
[01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:05.350]  The rainbow jelly, it got me.
[01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:07.350]  It's definitely getting me.
[01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:09.350]  What was it again?
[01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:10.350]  Rainbow jelly.
[01:27:10.510 --> 01:27:11.510]  Yeah.
[01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:15.510]  So we're coming up on awards pretty quick here.
[01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:19.510]  I think we're about 30 minutes off from the awards ceremony.
[01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:22.510]  We're going to go get some more pre-rolls.
[01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:24.510]  Come on back.
[01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:26.510]  I want to say thanks to Kevin.
[01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:28.510]  Thanks to Craig.
[01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:31.510]  You guys want to drop any of your social media or anywhere where people can find you real quick.
[01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:33.510]  People at home might want to check out what you're doing.
[01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:35.510]  Always check it out.
[01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:38.510]  Kevin at EarthJuice or www.earthjuice.com.
[01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:40.670]  Any questions, anything you guys need, reach out.
[01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:42.670]  Love to help you.
[01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:44.670]  Right on.
[01:27:45.670 --> 01:27:46.670]  Yeah.
[01:27:47.670 --> 01:27:54.670]  Talking trees, loud trees, space jam, Craig Satori, Satori Wellness.
[01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:56.670]  We're shadow banned.
[01:27:57.670 --> 01:27:58.670]  You probably won't find us.
[01:27:59.670 --> 01:28:00.670]  High grade distribution.
[01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:02.670]  Find us if you can.
[01:28:03.670 --> 01:28:04.670]  Right on.
[01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:06.670]  I would like to add really quick.
[01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:17.830]  We're here incorporating cannabis and skateboarding as an old enthusiast of all things skateboarding and punk rock and hardcore music.
[01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:23.830]  This man and his indoor skate park in Arcata has been throwing down some awesome fucking shows lately.
[01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:25.830]  It's been really incredible.
[01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:29.830]  Every time I'm there, you always thank me for coming and I thank you for throwing them.
[01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:38.990]  But I do have to say that over the next several weeks after every one of those shows, so many people in our community come up and they're like, man, that was a really good scene the other night at that show.
[01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.990]  That is such an amazing venue.
[01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:45.990]  That is so cool that these guys are throwing shows like that because it's all ages.
[01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:50.990]  There's kids skating up and down on indoor skate ramps while the band is playing.
[01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.990]  There's a mosh pit.
[01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.990]  It's all community.
[01:28:55.150 --> 01:28:59.150]  It's all things just underground skate culture, cannabis culture.
[01:29:00.150 --> 01:29:01.150]  And it's freaking awesome, man.
[01:29:02.150 --> 01:29:03.150]  I appreciate you for it.
[01:29:04.150 --> 01:29:05.150]  Appreciate everybody that supports it.
[01:29:06.150 --> 01:29:07.150]  Keep it coming.
[01:29:08.150 --> 01:29:09.150]  Keep it coming.
[01:29:10.150 --> 01:29:11.150]  And I'll be there.
[01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:13.150]  We'll take another quick break.
[01:29:14.150 --> 01:29:16.150]  We'll show you around what's happening and we'll see you soon before the awards.
[01:29:45.590 --> 01:30:14.590]  Special Merit goes out to Peter Safari, Brandon Marko, Leighton Morrison, Chad Westworth, Chris Guerrero, Mr. Toe, Mr. Trees, Harty Gear, James Loud, The Crescent Family, Rooted Leaf, Hunter Earls, London and Hale Somerville, John Berfano, Elka, Matthew Gates, Mark Powers, Brian Mason, Brandon Russ, Trevor Whitt, Kevin James,
[01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:33.590]  Joe Dre, Mean G, Clackamas Coop, Duke Diamond, Tommy Chong, Danny Danko, Steve Cantrell, Michael Hendon, Jason Wilson, Mila Jensen, Benjamin Accardio, Mariah LaChapelle.
[01:30:33.590 --> 01:31:02.590]  And a very special thank you for the dedication and for bringing the science into what we believe in goes to Dr. Ethan Russo, Jeff Lowenfelds, Dr. Elaine Engel, Dr. Christine Jones, Dr. James White, Dr. Olivia Hussain, Dr. Mike Amaral-Pless, Professor Matthew DeBacco, Dr. Bruce Bugsby, Dr. Bob Hoss, Dr. Animus, Vincenzo DiMarzo,
[01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:06.590]  and Dr. Harvey Smith.
[01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:39.590]  Look at that baby, yeah! That's awesome. Woo-hoo!
[01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:44.590]  Alright you guys, we appreciate you sitting down with us. Yeah, for sure.
[01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:57.590]  Yeah, thanks for coming out to the 2022 Grow Up Awards, the Mega Awards as Sam likes to call it. We were calling it the 6th Annual, man, and she was like, no, no, no, no, it's just the Mega.
[01:31:58.590 --> 01:32:04.590]  We're not doing anything else, it's Mega. When you combine multiple states into one award show, it's Mega as fuck.
[01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:20.590]  I mean, that's a pretty amazing endeavor, right? Just to be hosting these awards, these competitions from state to state. Obviously the rules are different, the playing field is different, you've got to work with different genetics and different nurseries to make it all happen.
[01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:29.590]  Way to go Sam and Jake, fucking awesome, love these guys. Let's get some intros. Who are you guys and where are you from?
[01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:31.590]  Grow Leagues, Denver, Colorado.
[01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:34.590]  Nice, right on. And your name is Idris, right?
[01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:36.590]  I'm Idris.
[01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:45.590]  Oh yeah, here's your mic here. So yeah, we'll start over again. So yeah, tell me who you guys are, where you're from, and what brings you to the Grow Up.
[01:32:46.590 --> 01:32:49.590]  Grow Leagues, out of Denver, Colorado. I'm Idris.
[01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:51.590]  I'm Blake Floriani.
[01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:53.590]  I'm John Denby.
[01:32:54.590 --> 01:33:11.590]  Nice to meet you guys. Appreciate it. Denver and Colorado, obviously been in the game a while. You know, lots going on in there in the cannabis game. The first ones to go legal, you know, the first ones to have a Grow Up award, Grow Up competition, obviously that's where Jake and Sam are from.
[01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:21.590]  I got to spend a little time out there this summer. I went to their wedding in August out at Red Rocks. Probably the first time in Colorado in like 20 years.
[01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:31.590]  And I didn't catch, you know what, it was embarrassing that I couldn't catch a show because at the moment, and we were there for a wedding, it was a quick in and out weekend for my wife and I.
[01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:41.590]  And, you know, we got out there Friday night, we did the little like the free party, free wedding thing. And then Saturday we went out there and we hiked the trail. We got to hike the trail and check it all out.
[01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:54.590]  The wedding wasn't until later that afternoon. We went up to the amphitheater to see it for the first time. And as we got close, there was tons of people pulling in, and our people, and I'm like, how much, there's a concert tonight?
[01:33:55.590 --> 01:34:03.590]  I mean, we're not going to skip out on our friend's wedding. But I was like, who's playing? And it was like a reggae throwdown. It was like Steel Pulse and the Eye Tiles.
[01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:15.590]  And I was like, oh man, we're like right here. We're like at the entrance. And we couldn't make it. They did it again the following day. And obviously the day after a wedding, that ain't going to happen, you know.
[01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:24.590]  There were a bunch of people that were like, oh, you guys hiked the trail today? We're going to go tomorrow on Sunday after the wedding. And I was like, no, you're not. You ain't making it. And sure enough, nobody did.
[01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:28.590]  So tell us about what you guys do in Colorado.
[01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:37.590]  So we're a commercial grow site. Growing beautiful plants.
[01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:41.590]  Are you focused on a few select strains?
[01:34:45.590 --> 01:35:00.590]  So we're mainly a sativa-based hybrid company. That's kind of what we specialize in. We let the plants go to a little bit more maturity. We're not really doing the OG 50-day flips and all that stuff. That's kind of our niche, I would say.
[01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:14.590]  Definitely common. I see a lot of that stuff where they're just pulling it even when it's not ready. Just because it's business, business, business. Sometimes you forget the actual end result of what you're trying to do.
[01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:16.590]  Tell us when it's ready.
[01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:18.590]  Quality, the lifestyle of the plant.
[01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:22.590]  Share the mic. I know it'll be a pain in the ass to remember.
[01:35:23.590 --> 01:35:28.590]  Focus quality and making sure the plant runs the right term.
[01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:31.590]  Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
[01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:33.590]  You can watch it for a dime.
[01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:50.590]  Totally. A lot of that is just getting to know the cultivars who are growing in the first place. They all have a certain amount of weeks that they take to come to fruition. Then dialing them in your own system and finding out what's working for you when they're really ready. That's a big part of it.
[01:35:50.590 --> 01:36:13.590]  Obviously, having a specialty, specializing in sativa, it's nice because you can actually learn a little bit more about that specific genre of cannabis plants. Obviously, you're dealing with sativa and hybrids in general where they're all over the place for the most part. It takes a lot of time to dial in any strain. You never find multiple.
[01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:18.590]  Is this your first time competing in the Grow Up competition?
[01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:22.590]  This will be our third year in a row competing at the Grow Up.
[01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:24.590]  Obviously, right? You got the Bell.
[01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:26.590]  Got some Bells.
[01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:28.590]  This is just from last year.
[01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:30.590]  This is just from last year. Perfect.
[01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:32.590]  These both are from last year.
[01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:34.590]  I didn't even see that one over there.
[01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:36.590]  I can't forget that one.
[01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:38.590]  That's the big one.
[01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:40.590]  The Terps matter.
[01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:42.590]  Yeah, yeah. For sure they do.
[01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:44.590]  This will be our third year.
[01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:46.590]  That's awesome. Congratulations.
[01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:48.590]  What do you guys think about the award ceremony here?
[01:36:49.590 --> 01:37:07.590]  It's a great setup. The Grow Up Awards are always known to be a big party. We're happy to actually join in on one. The first year that we went, it was kind of a COVID year. It was all online. We had heard about the festivities that go on at these parties. We're just stoked to be here.
[01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:16.590]  That's awesome. I've only been to the award ceremony in California, actually. That's where I live. I kind of host a lot of the ones that we have out there.
[01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:33.590]  This is like a whole different hybrid of the award ceremony community. When you're combining states, and I get to meet you guys, because I don't get to Colorado all that often. I don't get to meet folks like you. I don't know if you want to pass the mic on.
[01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:35.590]  Can you throw out a little introduction here?
[01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:37.590]  How's it going today?
[01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:39.590]  Pretty good, man. So you're Cesar, right?
[01:37:40.590 --> 01:37:41.590]  Yes, I am.
[01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:43.590]  Nice to meet you. Tell us a little bit about what you do and why you're here.
[01:37:44.590 --> 01:37:49.590]  I work with Dark Horse Genetics. I supply the genetics for the Colorado chapter of the Grow Up this year.
[01:37:50.590 --> 01:37:52.590]  Right on, man. Killer. Thanks for being here.
[01:37:53.590 --> 01:37:56.590]  Excited to announce the win. Well, announce the strain.
[01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:58.590]  Yeah.
[01:37:59.590 --> 01:38:09.590]  I know we're just about getting to that time. About to find out some winners. I think there was only the one state, Sam said, where the mystery wasn't a mystery. It was Virginia.
[01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:11.590]  Yeah.
[01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:18.590]  But every other state. That's the biggest, coolest thing about this competition. Besides the fact that it's a level playing field.
[01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:22.590]  It's transparent. It's data-transparent. It's a level playing field.
[01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:42.590]  I love that part of it. I love that it shows the data on the fact that you can have 50 different people, different growers, in different areas of one state, growing the same damn strain and have it come out completely different. Right? I mean, as a geneticist.
[01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:52.590]  It's nice to see the poster of all the different strains. All the same strains grown differently by different people, companies, and stuff like that.
[01:38:53.590 --> 01:39:02.590]  It's nice to see different lights, different soils, different nutrients will get the same strain to come out and do a bunch of different expressions. It's nice to see all the different variations that are coming out.
[01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:11.590]  Yeah. I know, it's pretty fantastic. I've been watching this. We've been sponsoring it here, Royal Gold Soil. I think this is our fifth year as a sponsor.
[01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:20.590]  And it's been, at least in California, I get the opportunity to sponsor. I'll go out to some of the grows and some of the farms midway.
[01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:26.590]  And just kind of like check in and check out the plant and kind of see.
[01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:32.590]  And I've been growing weeds since 1994. I think it was the first time I put a plant in the ground.
[01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:43.590]  And to see this competition, what it's done for my own eyes is to see how amazing this plant is and how the versatility.
[01:39:44.590 --> 01:40:00.590]  And the reason why it's such a powerful medicine for people is that you can grow that same exact strain and have different effects for different qualities of how it affects the people that are consuming it based on how and where it's grown.
[01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:03.590]  I mean, that is a fantastic thing.
[01:40:04.590 --> 01:40:10.590]  Right. And I know I've heard that about grapes. I've even heard that about tomatoes and stuff like that. I've never seen that.
[01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:16.590]  I've grown tomatoes in a number of different places. When it comes down to harvest, I'm like, oh, it's a fucking tomato. It's delicious. It's great.
[01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:24.590]  But cannabis, man, I don't know, man. It just seems so different when it comes to what's happening in this competition.
[01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:27.590]  It's a product of the environment, for sure.
[01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:37.590]  It really is. And the style that it's grown. What you're using it, the nutrients, the soil that it's grown in. What's your climate like? What time of year?
[01:40:38.590 --> 01:40:48.590]  We were just talking to the folks that were just here with us before you guys. The potion that they come out with at the end of every competition where it shows the finished flower and how drastically different.
[01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:51.590]  Crazy, right?
[01:40:52.590 --> 01:41:00.590]  One of my favorite parts about this competition is kind of seeing the end result. All the different flavors of the same strain that were produced.
[01:41:01.590 --> 01:41:07.590]  I was just hearing, I just asked these guys what was their opinion on the overall strength so far.
[01:41:08.590 --> 01:41:14.590]  And they're letting me know what they thought. I like to hear the good and bad and everything. I don't want to hear just, oh, yeah, it's good just because you want to make me feel good about it.
[01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:22.590]  If you didn't like it, why? I'm not going to learn if everybody's being lied to or just not honest with each other.
[01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:31.590]  So that's where I feel like if I know what people didn't like about it, I know what not to supply for future events or what to look for.
[01:41:32.590 --> 01:41:40.590]  Specific growth traits or if it needs to root faster, if it needs to put on more yield or whatever. I do need to get all that feedback whether it's good or bad.
[01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:46.590]  I think we can safely say that you hit a winner for the Colorado.
[01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:51.590]  We'll go with that. That's a commercial keeper for sure.
[01:41:52.590 --> 01:42:01.590]  Yeah, absolutely. What are you working on as far as for the future? Obviously, there's always the chase for the next big thing.
[01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:12.590]  Obviously, when you're talking about medicinals and the power of the goods that it's going to deliver to the people that are consuming it, you find a balance in there.
[01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:15.590]  You kind of search for the two, trying to find your way in the middle.
[01:42:16.590 --> 01:42:22.590]  So I kind of got a couple of different things going on right now. I work with Dark Horse, chief genetics officer of Dark Horse.
[01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:32.590]  So pretty much anything genetics related pretty much comes from me. I help them with new genetics and sourcing to make new projects and new processes in the future.
[01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:38.590]  Besides that, I've made my own process of doing my own thing, trying to make my own name out there.
[01:42:39.590 --> 01:42:47.590]  So everything that I have right now is being tested right now before I release it, being that this is my debut to the world with Feminize Seeds.
[01:42:47.590 --> 01:42:51.590]  So I just want to make sure that I do everything properly, make sure it's tested, have all the documentation.
[01:42:52.590 --> 01:42:57.590]  I don't want to just pile it up and just throw out a hot strain right there and put it out there just because it's hot right now.
[01:42:58.590 --> 01:43:01.590]  It might not be in six months, but I just want to make sure I have all that documentation out there.
[01:43:02.590 --> 01:43:12.590]  So I feel like the market right now, prices aren't as high as people were used to, but specific traits when it comes to like six, seven, eight percent hash numbers is definitely something that a lot of people are still looking for.
[01:43:12.590 --> 01:43:19.590]  People still paying top dollar for those genetics. So I'm more in it for genetics related reasons versus just trying to sell flour.
[01:43:20.590 --> 01:43:23.590]  Because right now it's just like a race to the bottom for everybody. Just trying to sell flour.
[01:43:24.590 --> 01:43:31.590]  I'm just trying to make my own lane and sell genetics and source genetics and find new things and all that stuff genetics related.
[01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:37.590]  We're going to have to talk here soon.
[01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:40.590]  I really appreciate you guys coming and sitting down and chatting.
[01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:47.590]  No doubt. Are you guys going to be checking out the MJ Biz Expo while you're here as well?
[01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:50.590]  We're going to pop in tomorrow, a little bit on Thursday for sure.
[01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:53.590]  Have you been to it before?
[01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:56.590]  We've been here four years before.
[01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:59.590]  2019 maybe?
[01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:02.590]  Yeah, right here.
[01:44:02.590 --> 01:44:05.590]  We were over there setting up our booth earlier and it's two levels.
[01:44:06.590 --> 01:44:07.590]  Oh really?
[01:44:08.590 --> 01:44:10.590]  Yeah, it is. It's upstairs and downstairs.
[01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:12.590]  Where did you guys do that?
[01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:16.590]  We're in the cultivation zone. Actually, we are booth 1435.
[01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:27.590]  It's kind of a nice new setup the way that they're doing it because before I think you had like 1200 vendors all pretty much spread out on one giant floor.
[01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:37.590]  So everybody kind of either bumbles around trying to figure out what the fuck they came for or you came with a direction and you knew who you wanted to see and talk to.
[01:44:38.590 --> 01:44:44.590]  But trying to find everybody it basically took just walking around a maze and getting lost.
[01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:51.590]  So this is kind of nice. They got like, you know, all the processing and stuff all in one section cultivation in one section.
[01:44:52.590 --> 01:44:53.590]  It's kind of nice.
[01:44:53.590 --> 01:45:05.590]  I feel like it'll keep the interest in certain for certain, you know, levels of business a little more, you know, isolated so that you know, everybody could kind of accomplish what they came for.
[01:45:06.590 --> 01:45:14.590]  Sometimes like because I've been a part of a lot of trade shows and stuff like that. There's pros and cons to grouping people in to certain areas.
[01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:22.590]  Like if you want just vape carts or vape stuff or like genetics and cultivation extraction, certain people only go in there for specific things.
[01:45:23.590 --> 01:45:26.590]  So you might not get eyes on your product because people are only looking for specific things.
[01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:40.590]  So that's kind of like why a lot of trades that I've been to, they kind of like mixing everybody together just so you could kind of get like an even spread of checking out the event versus just going specifically for that and not giving other vendors a chance to do that.
[01:45:40.590 --> 01:45:42.590]  That's just my opinion from what I've seen.
[01:45:44.590 --> 01:45:56.590]  I could agree with that, but it does get a little bit overwhelming, you know, as a cultivation company, you know, trying to go in there and look at the cultivation stuff when you're just bombarded with packaging and startup consulting and all that.
[01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:59.590]  So I'm actually really excited that they did kind of bring it up like that.
[01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:03.590]  To your point, like there's definitely something to be said about mixing it together.
[01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:10.590]  As an end user, I want to go and see it the way that how we're talking about it now, how it's all grouped together, because there's very specific things that I'm going for anyway.
[01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:15.590]  So I don't want to go looking for extraction or anything when I have zero to do with extraction.
[01:46:16.590 --> 01:46:19.590]  So I could just go for cultivation if they have genetics, it's cool, but like very specific area.
[01:46:20.590 --> 01:46:24.590]  It just helps save so much time because it was so spread out last year.
[01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:26.590]  All the steps.
[01:46:26.590 --> 01:46:32.590]  It's insane. It's like so much convention center just to see like you can't even find everything. You got to know the exact booth number.
[01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:38.590]  Yeah. And that's obviously, you know, there's the differences in any industry.
[01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:45.590]  I don't give a fuck if you're in the toilet paper industry or whatever it is like there's segments that are just not going to be as available.
[01:46:46.590 --> 01:46:49.590]  You know, there's going to be insurance and packaging and processing and cultivation.
[01:46:50.590 --> 01:46:53.590]  And like, I'm excited to see what it's like tomorrow.
[01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:56.590]  And I think it'll be really cool. I'm happy that you're doing it.
[01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:59.590]  We'll see if it works the way I think it is.
[01:47:00.590 --> 01:47:01.590]  I think it will.
[01:47:02.590 --> 01:47:03.590]  I give you time.
[01:47:04.590 --> 01:47:05.590]  I'm going to give you time.
[01:47:06.590 --> 01:47:07.590]  I'm going to give you time.
[01:47:08.590 --> 01:47:09.590]  I'm going to give you time.
[01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:11.590]  I'm going to give you time.
[01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:13.590]  I'm going to give you time.
[01:47:14.590 --> 01:47:15.590]  I appreciate you guys.
[01:47:16.590 --> 01:47:17.590]  Thank you for having us.
[01:47:18.590 --> 01:47:21.590]  Hell yeah. Enjoy. Enjoy. Good luck.
[01:47:22.590 --> 01:47:26.590]  Yes. Yes. Yeah. Let's take a picture with you guys holding your belt.
[01:47:28.590 --> 01:47:30.590]  Let's do it. I appreciate you.
[01:47:34.590 --> 01:47:35.590]  Let's get in there.
[01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:36.590]  Get in there.
[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:45.180]  Oh, you don't get to get in the picture.
[01:47:57.180 --> 01:48:01.180]  Yeah, man. Hey, thank you. Absolutely, man. Thank you. I appreciate you.
[01:48:02.180 --> 01:48:04.180]  1435. Yes. Yeah, man.
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:05.180]  Yeah, man.
[01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:08.180]  Awesome, man. Thank you.
[01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:12.180]  Thank you. Appreciate you, brother.
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:43.520]  Welcome to my home. This is Green Bros.
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:47.520]  I love it. This is really exciting for us.
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:54.520]  I started in the cannabis business industry growing in my closet with a photo.
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:57.520]  John, I don't know how many years ago. I didn't remember photograph.
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:02.520]  Everybody come on. Photograph. No photograph. Yeah. Come on. See? Yeah.
[02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:04.520]  So that's where the roots are.
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:12.520]  I started this company in 2012 and we started in my garage.
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:14.520]  So that was pretty cool.
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:21.520]  And now here we are in 50,000 square feet, multinational, multi-state, obviously.
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:23.520]  Decent sized little company.
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:25.520]  And then we had this opportunity.
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:33.520]  And I think that this to me is something I never envisioned when I got into the industry.
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:38.520]  Is that we would have an award show for growing cannabis. Right?
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:41.520]  This is how cool is this? Right? Here we are.
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:44.520]  So my job is really simple here.
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:48.520]  I just need to introduce the most important people of the evening.
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:57.520]  I think it's Sam and Jake are coming up to give the awards for this great opportunity.
[02:03:36.470 --> 02:04:00.470]  Oh, wait. Here he is.
[02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:03.470]  Do you have a second microphone? Yes, we do.
[02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:07.470]  Jake, what happened? I thought we were going to wear our wedding outfits.
[02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:13.470]  I thought, wait, the text I got said, wear the weed ostrich.
[02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:18.470]  I mean, this is clearly the weed ostrich.
[02:04:19.470 --> 02:04:21.470]  And it was, yeah, it was supposed to be inflatable too, huh?
[02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:25.470]  Oh, well, I mean, batteries die. It's the cannabis industry.
[02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:28.470]  Something's not going to work for some reason.
[02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:31.470]  I mean, I'd marry you in anything. So I think you look great.
[02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:34.470]  But if you want to take that off, you totally can.
[02:04:35.470 --> 02:04:38.470]  I will show you the text where you said weed ostrich.
[02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:42.470]  Okay. Well, blame it on autocorrect. I text that all the time.
[02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:48.470]  So seriously, that looks kind of bad. You might want to.
[02:04:49.470 --> 02:04:51.470]  With the weed ostrich.
[02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:56.470]  All right. Does everyone, can I just get a, does the crowd think I should take the weed ostrich off?
[02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:59.470]  All right. I love it.
[02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:06.470]  I mean, as I said, we got fucking married this year. We got married in August.
[02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:10.470]  Thank you. I love you so much.
[02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:14.470]  We've been together. We've been together 12 years.
[02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:19.470]  We've been doing the grow off for six, seven years. What is time anymore?
[02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:22.470]  To a weed ostrich? Nothing.
[02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:25.470]  This guy doesn't respect time. Doesn't respect inflatability.
[02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:30.470]  Anyway, this is like literally the dress that I wore for our wedding.
[02:05:31.470 --> 02:05:33.470]  And I was like, fuck it. This is the biggest party we've ever thrown.
[02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:36.470]  I'm wearing my goddamn wedding dress. Let's party.
[02:05:37.470 --> 02:05:39.470]  And it's the biggest party because of all y'all.
[02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:42.470]  I thought that this was going to be a bunch of suits from MJ Biz that were like,
[02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:46.470]  let's come over and grab a bunch of growers. We're going to smuggle it back to her.
[02:05:47.470 --> 02:05:50.470]  You know, multi-state. Nope. It's, it's not.
[02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:53.470]  It's multi-state. Nope. It's y'all. It's you.
[02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:56.470]  Raise your hand if you're a grower in here.
[02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:58.470]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:04.470]  I swear to God, this is the biggest gathering of growers that MJ Biz has ever seen.
[02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:07.470]  And y'all are from so many different States.
[02:06:08.470 --> 02:06:11.470]  Like I have cried more in the last couple of weeks,
[02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:14.470]  just thinking and talking to all of you, planning for this,
[02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:18.470]  watching you talk to people from across the country about the thing you love most.
[02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:20.470]  Like, my God, this has been such a joy.
[02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:25.470]  Thank you all so much for participating. Like, fuck, fuck. Thank you.
[02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:27.470]  I love you guys.
[02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:32.810]  I know she started this, I cried so much and we were like, where's she going with this?
[02:06:35.810 --> 02:06:39.810]  All right. So, uh, we, we do this, you know, for all of you,
[02:06:40.810 --> 02:06:43.810]  but it takes an army to pull this off. First and foremost,
[02:06:44.810 --> 02:06:46.810]  I want to thank our operations manager, Cynthia over here,
[02:06:47.810 --> 02:06:51.810]  who's telling you guys to keep in line, get your samples in,
[02:06:52.810 --> 02:06:56.810]  make sure you get tested so you can win one of these belts. Yeah. Cynthia.
[02:06:57.810 --> 02:06:59.810]  Thank you. You're the best.
[02:07:00.810 --> 02:07:02.810]  And I told her earlier that she's the funniest person I know. I'm sorry.
[02:07:03.810 --> 02:07:06.810]  There's so many people that came up to us and we're like, are you Cynthia?
[02:07:07.810 --> 02:07:11.810]  That was like an outsized impact that she has had. We're really grateful to have.
[02:07:12.810 --> 02:07:15.810]  And not to mention, I mean, we need money to make this happen, right?
[02:07:16.810 --> 02:07:17.810]  We all need money to make this happen.
[02:07:18.810 --> 02:07:19.810]  And that comes from our amazing sponsors.
[02:07:20.810 --> 02:07:23.810]  They help make the products that you all use to grow these plants.
[02:07:24.810 --> 02:07:27.810]  And in California awards, we did this thing where it's like, okay,
[02:07:28.810 --> 02:07:30.810]  we're going to thank a lot of people. So I did a thank you train.
[02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:33.810]  And you all said choo choo. And I came up with this like,
[02:07:34.810 --> 02:07:36.810]  thank you truck where when I say thank you, the thank you trucks here,
[02:07:37.810 --> 02:07:42.810]  you guys go, a woo ga. So can we, it's interactive. Like, come on, participate.
[02:07:43.810 --> 02:07:45.810]  So let's start the thank you truck.
[02:07:46.810 --> 02:07:50.810]  Wait, I saw several people who did not.
[02:07:51.810 --> 02:07:53.810]  And if you don't know what an augu is,
[02:07:54.810 --> 02:07:56.810]  it's just the thing that we've been doing for the last minute.
[02:07:57.810 --> 02:07:58.810]  So can we try that one more time?
[02:07:59.810 --> 02:08:00.810]  The thank you trucks coming down.
[02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:03.810]  Thank you, Jake. You're so good at getting people together.
[02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:07.810]  All right. So first and foremost, we met these amazing folks.
[02:08:08.810 --> 02:08:10.810]  They're kind of brand new on the, on the scene.
[02:08:11.810 --> 02:08:12.810]  They're making amazing lighting tech.
[02:08:13.810 --> 02:08:15.810]  I didn't warn him that he's coming up here.
[02:08:16.810 --> 02:08:18.810]  He keeps, he kept our lights on this year.
[02:08:19.810 --> 02:08:22.810]  And I hope that you all have had a chance to meet G grow lighting
[02:08:23.810 --> 02:08:26.810]  because they're kind of changing the game. I want you to know, Ken,
[02:08:27.810 --> 02:08:28.810]  Ken, would you like to say something?
[02:08:28.810 --> 02:08:31.810]  I want you to know, Ken, Ken, would you mind coming up and saying hello,
[02:08:32.810 --> 02:08:33.810]  making sure folks know you so they can come say hi.
[02:08:34.810 --> 02:08:37.810]  Everybody give it up for Ken, who does not know he's going to be up here.
[02:08:38.810 --> 02:08:40.810]  I'm so sorry. Ken, our presenting sponsor, Ken from G grow.
[02:08:41.810 --> 02:08:45.810]  Thank you. And congratulations to whoever the winner is.
[02:08:46.810 --> 02:08:49.810]  And this is all exciting. It's good to see everybody come in for this.
[02:08:50.810 --> 02:08:52.810]  All right, Ken, many words.
[02:08:53.810 --> 02:08:55.810]  Ken, Ken needs a thank you truck.
[02:08:55.810 --> 02:08:56.810]  Hell yeah.
[02:08:57.810 --> 02:09:00.810]  Okay. So, and also in no particular order,
[02:09:01.810 --> 02:09:02.810]  we have another bunch of amazing other sponsors.
[02:09:03.810 --> 02:09:06.810]  I want to thank Royal gold soil, the best grow medium in the biz.
[02:09:07.810 --> 02:09:10.810]  Boveda, our favorite way to present or preserve terpenes.
[02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:14.810]  Uncle Wiggies, our favorite Colorado homegrown nutrient company.
[02:09:15.810 --> 02:09:18.810]  Left Coast wholesale, our preferred wholesale distributor.
[02:09:19.810 --> 02:09:21.810]  What? I just said left coast.
[02:09:22.810 --> 02:09:23.810]  I said left coast.
[02:09:23.810 --> 02:09:24.810]  I just said left coast.
[02:09:25.810 --> 02:09:26.810]  Sorry. I'm sometimes I'm going to do that.
[02:09:27.810 --> 02:09:28.810]  I get excited to go.
[02:09:29.810 --> 02:09:30.810]  It's just the name of the thing.
[02:09:31.810 --> 02:09:32.810]  He gets excited. We got this labs.
[02:09:33.810 --> 02:09:35.810]  They're our favorite microbial remediation service.
[02:09:36.810 --> 02:09:37.810]  Victory innovation sprayers.
[02:09:38.810 --> 02:09:39.810]  Dino micro hooked it up tonight.
[02:09:40.810 --> 02:09:41.810]  I don't know if you got any other swag with fucking everywhere.
[02:09:42.810 --> 02:09:44.810]  Sierra natural sciences, leaders in IPM.
[02:09:45.810 --> 02:09:47.810]  Geopods, our favorite pots with handles.
[02:09:48.810 --> 02:09:49.810]  We're not using other pots anymore.
[02:09:50.810 --> 02:09:52.810]  And we leave works DNA.
[02:09:53.810 --> 02:09:55.810]  Making sure our genetics are pathogen free.
[02:09:56.810 --> 02:09:58.810]  So if you don't know them, please check them out.
[02:09:59.810 --> 02:10:00.810]  They support us. They support you.
[02:10:01.810 --> 02:10:02.810]  We couldn't do this without them.
[02:10:03.810 --> 02:10:05.810]  They think they got a thank you truck.
[02:10:06.810 --> 02:10:07.810]  What? Oh, yeah.
[02:10:08.810 --> 02:10:09.810]  I did the wrong truck.
[02:10:10.810 --> 02:10:11.810]  Which truck did you do?
[02:10:12.810 --> 02:10:13.810]  I just went whoop whoop.
[02:10:14.810 --> 02:10:15.810]  I'm just spending too much time with my jugular friends.
[02:10:16.810 --> 02:10:17.810]  And for that, I apologize.
[02:10:18.810 --> 02:10:19.810]  Jake, save that for the next award.
[02:10:20.810 --> 02:10:21.810]  It's all family.
[02:10:22.810 --> 02:10:23.810]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:10:24.810 --> 02:10:25.810]  What do we have next, Jake?
[02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:27.810]  I didn't read this since I read it.
[02:10:28.810 --> 02:10:30.810]  Oh, and we have all of our sincere thank you.
[02:10:31.810 --> 02:10:32.810]  No, we already did that.
[02:10:33.810 --> 02:10:35.810]  We're going to enjoy a little presentation.
[02:10:36.810 --> 02:10:37.810]  Yes, you're right.
[02:10:38.810 --> 02:10:39.810]  You read this.
[02:10:40.810 --> 02:10:41.810]  I'm so proud of it.
[02:10:42.810 --> 02:10:43.810]  All right.
[02:10:44.810 --> 02:10:45.810]  So part of being in the grow off, we obviously.
[02:10:46.810 --> 02:10:47.810]  Oh, wait.
[02:10:48.810 --> 02:10:49.810]  I don't think we've acknowledged that we're live streaming.
[02:10:49.810 --> 02:10:50.810]  Are we live streaming?
[02:10:51.810 --> 02:10:52.810]  Is Future Cannabis Project watching this?
[02:10:53.810 --> 02:10:54.810]  Yes.
[02:10:55.810 --> 02:10:56.810]  Can we give a shout out?
[02:10:57.810 --> 02:10:58.810]  Future Cannabis Project is bringing this to the masses.
[02:10:59.810 --> 02:11:00.810]  So if you weren't able to make it tonight, you can watch it on.
[02:11:01.810 --> 02:11:02.810]  Hopefully you're watching it online.
[02:11:03.810 --> 02:11:06.810]  And Royal Grown Radio is here assisting in all of that.
[02:11:07.810 --> 02:11:11.810]  Listen, I would love to give them a shout out, but I'm also sure they're making fun of me in the comments.
[02:11:12.810 --> 02:11:15.810]  I'm wearing an uninflated ostrich.
[02:11:16.810 --> 02:11:17.810]  I love that you're holding it up.
[02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:19.810]  YouTube's going to be devastating.
[02:11:20.810 --> 02:11:21.810]  Okay.
[02:11:22.810 --> 02:11:23.810]  So hi to all of our online people.
[02:11:24.810 --> 02:11:25.810]  Thank you for tuning in.
[02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:29.810]  I hope some of you win, but the others are in the crowd that will win.
[02:11:30.810 --> 02:11:31.810]  And Jake is.
[02:11:32.810 --> 02:11:33.810]  The head of the thing is doing everything.
[02:11:34.810 --> 02:11:35.810]  I know.
[02:11:36.810 --> 02:11:37.810]  That's why I told you to take it off.
[02:11:38.810 --> 02:11:39.810]  So part of the grow off, as you know, everyone starts with the same genetics.
[02:11:40.810 --> 02:11:42.810]  We judge by lab results, but we also ask you how you grew your plant.
[02:11:43.810 --> 02:11:48.810]  And the purpose of that is to help give you actionable information back about the mystery strain.
[02:11:49.810 --> 02:11:58.810]  And this being our biggest year ever in eight states, we wanted to bring in some big guns to help us improve that data reporting, that information that's being given back to you.
[02:11:59.810 --> 02:12:05.810]  And if Sarah is in the crowd, she is a soil scientist, agronomist and data analysis.
[02:12:06.810 --> 02:12:08.810]  She is doing our reporting this year.
[02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:11.810]  She had some info on 2021 that will be up on our YouTube afterwards.
[02:12:12.810 --> 02:12:13.810]  Super fucking fascinating.
[02:12:14.810 --> 02:12:16.810]  I don't know if we can pause for that.
[02:12:17.810 --> 02:12:22.810]  Do you still like to let everybody know what you're up to and how we're going to work this year?
[02:12:23.810 --> 02:12:26.810]  I don't think we can do this screen, but hey, give it up for Sarah.
[02:12:27.810 --> 02:12:28.810]  Guys, let her hear it.
[02:12:29.810 --> 02:12:31.810]  Hey, hey, everybody.
[02:12:32.810 --> 02:12:35.590]  All right.
[02:12:35.590 --> 02:12:36.590]  So I have a video.
[02:12:37.590 --> 02:12:38.590]  It's live streaming and you guys can all see it.
[02:12:39.590 --> 02:12:48.590]  But basically I took the 2021 data from the Grow Off and I made analytics out of it, charts and graphs and things of that nature.
[02:12:49.590 --> 02:12:55.590]  So and I have a little speech to give and I'm going to have my little prompter.
[02:12:56.590 --> 02:13:02.590]  So first of all, I'm just really grateful for Sam and Jake for their commitment to the Grow Off competition all these years.
[02:13:03.590 --> 02:13:20.590]  And all of the contestants that throw their data in the ring that is able to give us really cool information about our industry and all the sponsors that are able to help fund the project and keep this going and contribute to the cannabis science that we're all looking for.
[02:13:21.590 --> 02:13:30.760]  So data can tell us really cool stories about people, places and things all over the world.
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:40.760]  And most of us have apps on our phone and those apps are collecting, aggregating and using these data to create convenient products for us while making profits for the service providers.
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:48.760]  These apps track things like our sleeping patterns, our walking patterns, our caloric intake and even a woman's fertility cycle.
[02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:56.760]  These apps are collecting data from people all over the world, gleaning information about who's doing what, where and when.
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:01.760]  You willingly trade your data for the convenience of using their app and service.
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:04.760]  But I'm not here to talk about those apps.
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:17.760]  I'm here to talk about the importance of cannabis agricultural data and the importance of us collecting it on ourselves through a platform like the Grow Off for the longevity of our businesses, our livelihood and our industry.
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:24.760]  Major breakthroughs in ag tech and every other industry in the world have affected how we relate with data today.
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:37.760]  And after we nearly killed our entire country in the Dust Bowl in the 1900s, causing the Great Depression, we became very aware that understanding our relationship with plants and soil is literally a life or death situation.
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:45.760]  So being able to collect and analyze large amounts of data can significantly decrease the amount of time it takes to solve some of these problems.
[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:54.760]  And when we're talking about something that's a matter of life or death, kind of like we're experiencing in our industry today, time is of the essence.
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:09.760]  So today data has become one of the most valuable assets in the entire world, which is why companies like Google and Monsanto are prioritizing data collection so they can make decisions about their companies.
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:19.760]  Google aggregates data from its users to inform marketing strategies and Monsanto aggregates biological data to become more efficient at growing food.
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:26.760]  As a soil scientist and agronomist, a big one that comes to mind for me is crop standards and farm efficiency.
[02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:38.760]  Through soil plant testing and in conjunction with fertilizer, climate and weather patterns, we figured out the most efficient and effective way to grow corn and soy and wheat to feed our country and the world.
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:48.760]  This efficiency is due to the creation of crop standards and growing regions, which has required data and science to figure out.
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:52.760]  This is something that the cannabis industry has yet to establish.
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:16:00.760]  And that's one of the things that I want to talk about today and that's why we're all here with this competition.
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:15.760]  And I think that we can, well, while I don't agree with much of the practices that Big Ag is doing, I do think that they have done some really clever things by using the data to increase profits and efficiency in farming.
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:18.760]  And that's a page that we can take from their book.
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:28.760]  But we in the cannabis industry can use data to learn more about what makes us valuable and how we can monetize our genetics and intellectual property in this new world.
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:35.760]  How can we make our growing practices more efficient? How can we increase profits and yields while decreasing costs and inputs?
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:43.760]  What's the best geographic location to grow a certain cultivar and better yet, what cultivar will grow in a certain region?
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:46.760]  And these are things that we're trying to find out.
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:48.760]  And data is the answer.
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:55.760]  We have so many questions that we'd like answered and data analytics can expedite this process for us.
[02:16:55.760 --> 02:17:01.760]  All of these data will be collected and monetized at some point and it's just a matter of how we're going to participate in it.
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:05.760]  Will it be done by us or will it be done to us?
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:14.760]  Collecting and aggregating data about ourselves empowers us to get more efficient and become more profitable while remaining independent.
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:23.760]  Unlike the fate of the corn and soybean farmers of the Midwest who receive federal funding in the form of subsidies in exchange for their freedom and autonomy.
[02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:28.760]  We're currently in a very unique position to harness this value for ourselves.
[02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:38.760]  New ways are being developed to collect and protect your intellectual property and we can have the best of all worlds but it does require us to come together to make that happen.
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:48.760]  We need to stay current and we need to stay relevant otherwise big corporations will come in and push us out and I'm afraid of what our industry is going to look like if that happens.
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:18:00.760]  The Grow Off competition platform is a really incredible opportunity to empower us with the ability to collect large amounts of information about ourselves and a plant that we all love to work and grow with.
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:04.760]  I do want to address the data privacy concern.
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:16.760]  We're all very concerned about letting our precious cannabis genetics and cultivation data into the wrong hands and that's a real issue that I myself am concerned about which is why I'm here sharing this message with you all today.
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:32.760]  In the app example I gave before everyone who uses an app agrees to relinquish this valuable information to the company who's providing you with the convenient service of tracking your calories, your steps, your fertility cycle.
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:48.760]  I would like to see all of us use this data collection platform for the convenience of access to market, increased profits and diversification of IP assets because we're much more than just growing flowers for a crashing market.
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:51.760]  I want us to value ourselves and know that we're more than that.
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:19:01.760]  I know what side of the data conversation I want to be on and it's the one where we all come together as a community to collect, protect and own our own data.
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:04.760]  And then use it to elevate our industry together.
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:18.760]  A rising tide lifts all boats as they say and I truly believe that if we can find a way to share information while also protecting and monetizing or protecting ourselves and monetizing our brilliance we can all rise in this tide together.
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:25.760]  And there are many ways that you can all plug in to help support this collective mission and one of them is just to be part of the conversation.
[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:32.760]  Another one is to be part of this grow off collaboration which is a much, much more than just another cannabis competition.
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:40.760]  We are able to use scientific data to learn more about ourselves and the more that we know about ourselves the more empowered we can be.
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:44.760]  So I ask all of you what questions do you have?
[02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:46.760]  What do you want answered?
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:48.760]  What kind of questions do you want data to answer for you?
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:51.760]  What kind of issues and problems do we need to solve?
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:56.760]  We're part of a brain trust that's really good at solving problems and we have a lot of them.
[02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:00.760]  So let's bring them to the table and see what we can do to solve them.
[02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:02.760]  Thank you.
[02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:08.340]  I couldn't have said it better myself.
[02:20:09.340 --> 02:20:10.340]  Thank you so much.
[02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:12.340]  That was amazing.
[02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:14.340]  Sarah, thank you so, so much.
[02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:17.340]  Can I put up the video for you guys now that I'm not on stage?
[02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:19.340]  Absolutely.
[02:20:20.340 --> 02:20:21.340]  I cannot wait for you all to see this.
[02:20:22.340 --> 02:20:23.340]  It's fascinating.
[02:20:23.340 --> 02:20:26.340]  This is the videos for 2021 data.
[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:31.340]  The stuff you're going to put out for 2022, we have so much more diversity across farms.
[02:20:32.340 --> 02:20:33.340]  I am so excited.
[02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:35.340]  Thank you so, so much.
[02:20:36.340 --> 02:20:37.340]  I really appreciate it.
[02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:39.340]  Give it up one more time for Sarah, everybody.
[02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:44.340]  Seriously, Sarah's changing the game in what we're going to be offering all of you.
[02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:48.340]  And the more people that participate the better all that information gets.
[02:20:49.340 --> 02:20:52.340]  And I hope you all can learn from each other because that's what this is literally all about.
[02:20:53.340 --> 02:20:56.340]  We're seeing growers talk to each other from different states tonight.
[02:20:57.340 --> 02:20:58.340]  It's so fucking cool. I love it.
[02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:02.340]  Big shout out to everybody from Maine.
[02:21:03.340 --> 02:21:04.340]  Everybody from Maine is cool as hell.
[02:21:05.340 --> 02:21:07.340]  They're very quiet apparently too.
[02:21:08.340 --> 02:21:12.340]  I mean, speaking of Maine, shall we get to an award?
[02:21:13.340 --> 02:21:14.340]  You guys want to do an award? Let's do an award.
[02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:16.340]  Let's get on some boats.
[02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:18.340]  These boats aren't going to give themselves out.
[02:21:19.340 --> 02:21:20.340]  I think I put a lighthouse on it.
[02:21:21.340 --> 02:21:22.340]  Yeah, we're going to start with Maine.
[02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:29.340]  It's the westernmost state because I want those watching online to be able to go to bed because it's like one in the morning.
[02:21:30.340 --> 02:21:36.340]  Okay, so the breeder could not be here tonight, but they put out something fucking awesome.
[02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:38.340]  I loved all of the pictures.
[02:21:39.340 --> 02:21:41.340]  I haven't tried anything yet because I have to read numbers.
[02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:48.340]  But shout out to our genetics partner from Maine, Bungladesh Farms, John and Jason.
[02:21:49.340 --> 02:21:53.340]  And the strain was, are you ready?
[02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:55.340]  Oh, wait.
[02:21:56.340 --> 02:22:06.340]  Sherbin Run 7, which was Sunset Sherbert times runs, times runs, times strawberries and cream F2.
[02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:08.340]  And I failed to mention this earlier.
[02:22:09.340 --> 02:22:12.340]  We will be posting all of the results on Instagram shortly after.
[02:22:13.340 --> 02:22:14.340]  That's one of the magics that Cynthia pulls off.
[02:22:14.340 --> 02:22:17.340]  So you can check Instagram if you didn't catch all that.
[02:22:18.340 --> 02:22:19.340]  So anyway, let's get to some winners.
[02:22:20.340 --> 02:22:31.340]  So we're going to start with cannabinoids in third place and oh, in third place with 32.4 percent.
[02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:33.340]  Hello.
[02:22:34.340 --> 02:22:37.340]  I mean, Helm solventless.
[02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:43.340]  Oh, Cynthia, I forgot to get the medals are right here.
[02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:48.340]  You know, ready for this?
[02:22:49.340 --> 02:22:50.340]  They're kind of grouped together in.
[02:22:51.340 --> 02:22:52.340]  Oh, shoot.
[02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:54.340]  I'm so sorry.
[02:22:55.340 --> 02:22:56.340]  If you want to come over here, Cynthia will get your award.
[02:22:57.340 --> 02:22:59.340]  But also everybody give it up for Helm solventless.
[02:23:00.340 --> 02:23:01.340]  I'm so sorry.
[02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:03.340]  You guys are the best crowd.
[02:23:04.340 --> 02:23:05.340]  All right.
[02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:07.340]  Keep all this energy for the whole time.
[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:10.340]  And in third place with 32.9 percent.
[02:23:11.340 --> 02:23:13.340]  Full Moose Farm.
[02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:15.340]  Oh, booze.
[02:23:16.340 --> 02:23:19.340]  Booze.
[02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:22.340]  It sounds like you're saying boo, but it's just booze.
[02:23:23.340 --> 02:23:24.340]  Congratulations.
[02:23:25.340 --> 02:23:26.340]  If you wouldn't mind stepping over here.
[02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:28.340]  I failed to organize the medals.
[02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:30.340]  Well, just give them a fedora tap.
[02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:36.340]  And then in first place with 33.3 percent cannabinoids.
[02:23:37.340 --> 02:23:38.340]  Craft Living Organics.
[02:23:39.340 --> 02:23:41.340]  Is traveling organic?
[02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:43.340]  I don't.
[02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:45.340]  I don't believe that.
[02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:51.340]  But I think that was just to give a guy's raise your hand if you're craft living organics from Maine and don't you lie.
[02:23:52.340 --> 02:23:54.340]  We will tolerate none of that this evening.
[02:23:55.340 --> 02:23:56.340]  OK, great.
[02:23:57.340 --> 02:23:59.340]  And don't forget to pick up your bags, too.
[02:24:00.340 --> 02:24:01.340]  But we're going to move on to terpene.
[02:24:02.340 --> 02:24:03.340]  Let's just give it up really quick for Maine.
[02:24:04.340 --> 02:24:05.340]  The state of Maine.
[02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:07.340]  Doing great work.
[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:09.340]  Yeah, we're going to do terps.
[02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:11.340]  Oh, shoot.
[02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:13.340]  All right.
[02:24:13.340 --> 02:24:14.340]  Well, we're going to give it up for Maine terps.
[02:24:15.340 --> 02:24:20.340]  OK, don't go too far, because in third place with 2.41 percent terpenes.
[02:24:21.340 --> 02:24:22.340]  Helm solventless.
[02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:23.340]  Cream rises to the top.
[02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:25.340]  Truly.
[02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:29.340]  In second place with 2.77 terpenes.
[02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:31.340]  Full Moose Farms.
[02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:33.340]  You grow good.
[02:24:34.340 --> 02:24:35.340]  You grow good.
[02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:37.340]  We always say around the house.
[02:24:41.340 --> 02:24:44.340]  And in first place with 2.85 percent.
[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:48.340]  Seaside Medical and Nutrition.
[02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:49.340]  And in second place with 2.75 percent.
[02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:54.340]  Seaside Medical and Genetics who are in the house.
[02:24:55.340 --> 02:24:56.340]  Yes!
[02:24:57.340 --> 02:24:59.340]  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
[02:25:04.340 --> 02:25:05.340]  Would you like to say a few words?
[02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:07.340]  We always let our you.
[02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:09.340]  You may if you don't have to.
[02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:14.340]  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
[02:25:15.340 --> 02:25:16.340]  This is cool.
[02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:20.340]  We met earlier and you were talking to another Bell owner and winner.
[02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:22.340]  And this was very cool.
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:24.340]  I didn't want to tell you, but you did it.
[02:25:25.340 --> 02:25:26.340]  You did it.
[02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:28.340]  Wow.
[02:25:30.610 --> 02:25:31.610]  Wow.
[02:25:32.610 --> 02:25:33.610]  Wow.
[02:25:34.610 --> 02:25:35.610]  I don't have a lot to say.
[02:25:36.610 --> 02:25:39.610]  I have really one person to thank for this.
[02:25:40.610 --> 02:25:41.610]  And it's my brother, John.
[02:25:42.610 --> 02:25:44.610]  He years ago got me into growing.
[02:25:44.610 --> 02:25:48.610]  And for like 20 years, I've been just a hobbyist grower.
[02:25:49.610 --> 02:25:51.610]  And now I'm really getting into the industry.
[02:25:52.610 --> 02:25:55.610]  And man, I tell you, this is the healing of the nations.
[02:25:56.610 --> 02:25:57.610]  This is the answer.
[02:25:58.610 --> 02:25:59.610]  Cannabis is the cure.
[02:26:00.610 --> 02:26:01.610]  All right.
[02:26:02.610 --> 02:26:05.610]  It will be the common denominator and the common good of all.
[02:26:06.610 --> 02:26:08.610]  Eventually, all we have to do is keep believing.
[02:26:09.610 --> 02:26:10.610]  Yes.
[02:26:11.610 --> 02:26:12.610]  You guys are good, brother.
[02:26:12.610 --> 02:26:17.610]  That was the most awkward hug slash handshake I've ever had.
[02:26:18.610 --> 02:26:21.610]  But please keep it going for the state of Maine.
[02:26:23.610 --> 02:26:25.610]  We're going to do is move on.
[02:26:26.610 --> 02:26:28.610]  We have a lot of speakers, but you know what?
[02:26:29.610 --> 02:26:31.610]  We also have a lot of awards to give out.
[02:26:32.610 --> 02:26:38.610]  So I'm sure one of those two things is going to happen next.
[02:26:38.610 --> 02:26:39.610]  Guys, this is a lot.
[02:26:40.610 --> 02:26:43.610]  We went from like three or five states to eight states.
[02:26:44.610 --> 02:26:45.610]  I mean, look at all these flags.
[02:26:46.610 --> 02:26:47.610]  Anyway.
[02:26:48.610 --> 02:26:49.610]  All right.
[02:26:49.610 --> 02:26:52.610]  We're going to move on to Massachusetts and we'll actually have some time.
[02:26:53.610 --> 02:26:54.610]  Oh, wait.
[02:26:55.610 --> 02:26:56.610]  We were there.
[02:26:57.610 --> 02:26:58.610]  You took me to Massachusetts.
[02:26:59.610 --> 02:27:00.610]  It was lovely.
[02:27:01.610 --> 02:27:02.610]  Yeah.
[02:27:02.610 --> 02:27:05.610]  I showed her on the Cape and then we bought some people in Worcester.
[02:27:06.610 --> 02:27:07.610]  It was perfect.
[02:27:08.610 --> 02:27:09.610]  We did.
[02:27:09.610 --> 02:27:12.610]  We gave them like six hundred dollars worth of chicken wings because no one
[02:27:12.610 --> 02:27:13.610]  ate any food at the party.
[02:27:14.610 --> 02:27:15.610]  Yeah.
[02:27:15.610 --> 02:27:16.610]  And then you stabbed that guy.
[02:27:16.610 --> 02:27:17.610]  Oh, wait.
[02:27:17.610 --> 02:27:18.610]  Are we still live streaming?
[02:27:19.610 --> 02:27:20.610]  Yeah, I did not stab anyone.
[02:27:20.610 --> 02:27:21.610]  I did not.
[02:27:23.610 --> 02:27:24.610]  All right.
[02:27:24.610 --> 02:27:28.610]  So Massachusetts, we are blessed to have our genetics partner in the house
[02:27:29.610 --> 02:27:30.610]  tonight.
[02:27:30.610 --> 02:27:36.610]  He flew all the way and took at least one ferry from all the way from
[02:27:36.610 --> 02:27:37.610]  Martha's Vineyard.
[02:27:38.610 --> 02:27:39.610]  Is there he is.
[02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:41.610]  All right.
[02:27:41.610 --> 02:27:44.610]  Allow me to introduce Travis from Fat Cat Select Seeds to tell you what you
[02:27:44.610 --> 02:27:46.610]  grew in Massachusetts.
[02:27:47.610 --> 02:27:48.610]  Give it up.
[02:27:49.610 --> 02:27:55.210]  Give it up for the best.
[02:27:56.210 --> 02:27:57.210]  Hey, everybody.
[02:27:57.210 --> 02:27:58.210]  How you doing?
[02:27:58.210 --> 02:27:59.210]  Like she said, I'm Travis.
[02:28:00.210 --> 02:28:01.210]  This is my brother, Ian.
[02:28:01.210 --> 02:28:03.210]  We're Fat Cat Select Seeds from Massachusetts.
[02:28:04.210 --> 02:28:06.210]  It's been really fun providing the grow off strain.
[02:28:09.210 --> 02:28:10.210]  It was.
[02:28:11.210 --> 02:28:15.210]  Let's just say it wasn't easy to pick the right one, but I think we got
[02:28:15.210 --> 02:28:16.210]  it.
[02:28:16.210 --> 02:28:18.210]  So everyone wants to know what the strain is.
[02:28:19.210 --> 02:28:21.210]  So why don't we go ahead and we'll let everybody know.
[02:28:25.210 --> 02:28:29.210]  Strains called grease fire and everybody gets a T-shirt that's in the
[02:28:29.210 --> 02:28:30.210]  house.
[02:28:30.210 --> 02:28:34.210]  You can pick them up in the back corner on the back.
[02:28:34.210 --> 02:28:37.210]  We got the genetics so you know exactly where it came from.
[02:28:38.210 --> 02:28:40.210]  So pick up your free T-shirt on the way out.
[02:28:41.210 --> 02:28:42.210]  And again, thank you.
[02:28:42.210 --> 02:28:43.210]  It was great to be here.
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:48.760]  Thank you.
[02:28:49.760 --> 02:28:50.760]  Free T-shirt for everybody.
[02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:54.760]  I own three T-shirts and they all smell weird.
[02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:56.760]  OK.
[02:28:56.760 --> 02:28:57.760]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:58.760 --> 02:28:59.760]  Watch my train.
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:04.760]  All right. Please grab a T-shirt.
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:05.760]  This is no one's ever done that.
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:06.760]  That's so cool.
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:09.760]  Like you get a girl T-shirt and I love the Tukla is so cool.
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:11.760]  OK.
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:12.760]  Massachusetts are winners.
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:14.760]  We're also going to start here with cannabinoids.
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:19.760]  So in third place with twenty four point seven seven percent Lava
[02:29:19.760 --> 02:29:20.760]  House Gorilla.
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:22.760]  I believe you're here.
[02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:24.760]  Are you here.
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:25.760]  Let's give it up.
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:29.760]  Is the Lava House Lava House Gorilla down from the Raptors.
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:31.760]  I thought OK.
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:32.760]  Well you're watching.
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:34.760]  They had to go to a cooler party.
[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:35.760]  I get it.
[02:29:35.760 --> 02:29:36.760]  It's OK.
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:37.760]  Not judging.
[02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:38.760]  All right.
[02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:42.760]  In second place with twenty five point four percent.
[02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:44.760]  Bay grown.
[02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:45.760]  I think you're here.
[02:29:45.760 --> 02:29:46.760]  Bay grown.
[02:29:46.760 --> 02:29:47.760]  Raise your hand.
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:48.760]  Are you here.
[02:29:48.760 --> 02:29:49.760]  Hell yeah.
[02:29:49.760 --> 02:29:51.760]  We got a second place cannabinoids.
[02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:53.760]  Sorry about.
[02:29:53.760 --> 02:29:54.760]  Oh and then also a handshake.
[02:29:55.760 --> 02:29:57.760]  Man Cynthia will get your word over here.
[02:29:58.760 --> 02:29:59.760]  All right.
[02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:02.760]  And then in first place with twenty nine point six one percent.
[02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:03.760]  Jimmy up the farm.
[02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:05.760]  Watching from home.
[02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:12.760]  And let's go to terpenes.
[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:14.760]  Oh this was an interesting one.
[02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:15.760]  We have a tie.
[02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:18.760]  And this literally I think it's only ever happened once.
[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:23.760]  But it's not a tie for third place because with one point oh
[02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:25.760]  eight percent we have Ben Jallow.
[02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:28.760]  I don't think he's here.
[02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:29.760]  But congrats from home.
[02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:31.760]  Hi Ben.
[02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:32.760]  Hi Ben.
[02:30:32.760 --> 02:30:34.760]  I hope you're warm.
[02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:36.760]  OK but we do have a tie for second place.
[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:41.760]  So we have one point four percent.
[02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:46.760]  We also have Lava House Gorilla and Grandma Pain.
[02:30:47.760 --> 02:30:48.760]  Is Grandma Pain.
[02:30:51.760 --> 02:30:52.760]  Oh yeah.
[02:30:52.760 --> 02:30:53.760]  But Lava House wasn't here either.
[02:30:54.760 --> 02:30:56.760]  I mean if Grandma Pain didn't make it who would.
[02:30:56.760 --> 02:30:58.760]  I have to assume it's like to help Grandma's pain.
[02:30:59.760 --> 02:31:00.760]  Right.
[02:31:00.760 --> 02:31:02.760]  Listen I'm not here to judge Grandma Pain.
[02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:05.760]  Well congratulations.
[02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:06.760]  Second place.
[02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:08.760]  And then in first place.
[02:31:10.760 --> 02:31:12.760]  With one point eight five percent.
[02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:14.760]  Baygrown.
[02:31:14.760 --> 02:31:15.760]  Come on back down here.
[02:31:15.760 --> 02:31:16.760]  Get your belt.
[02:31:18.760 --> 02:31:19.760]  Oh no.
[02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:22.760]  Find your state.
[02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:24.760]  I think it's over here.
[02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:26.760]  This is potency.
[02:31:26.760 --> 02:31:28.760]  That's your terpene belt.
[02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:31.760]  Hey do you want to say.
[02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:33.760]  Oh yeah.
[02:31:33.760 --> 02:31:35.760]  Baygrown would you like to say a word or.
[02:31:36.760 --> 02:31:37.760]  Yeah.
[02:31:37.760 --> 02:31:38.760]  No.
[02:31:38.760 --> 02:31:39.760]  Nope.
[02:31:39.760 --> 02:31:40.760]  But this is great.
[02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:43.760]  Thank you guys for this competition on.
[02:31:43.760 --> 02:31:44.760]  I had a great time growing it.
[02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:46.760]  I grew it outside.
[02:31:46.760 --> 02:31:50.760]  And the genetics did really really well out in the northeast.
[02:31:50.760 --> 02:31:52.760]  So congratulations to Fat Cat.
[02:31:52.760 --> 02:31:54.760]  I'm definitely going to be grabbing a couple more packs of that.
[02:31:54.760 --> 02:31:55.760]  Yeah.
[02:31:56.760 --> 02:31:57.760]  I don't think that.
[02:31:57.760 --> 02:31:58.760]  And thank you.
[02:31:58.760 --> 02:31:59.760]  Congratulations again.
[02:32:00.760 --> 02:32:03.760]  It is a struggle to find something that we're going to think will
[02:32:03.760 --> 02:32:08.760]  perform outdoor indoor in a bunch of different growing medium.
[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:10.760]  This is tough.
[02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:14.760]  And so I think that Massachusetts just won outdoor turf.
[02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:15.760]  I love this.
[02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:16.760]  I love this.
[02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:17.760]  I mean.
[02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:18.760]  Oh let's go.
[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:20.760]  Who says California is the only outdoor state.
[02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:21.760]  Let's go.
[02:32:21.760 --> 02:32:24.760]  I heard one person in the back that was like Barry with me.
[02:32:26.760 --> 02:32:27.760]  I'm stoked.
[02:32:27.760 --> 02:32:30.760]  And you know this particular situation.
[02:32:30.760 --> 02:32:32.760]  You know Travis being in Martha's Vineyard.
[02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:35.760]  We're talking to him about our pathogen testing our SOP is how to
[02:32:35.760 --> 02:32:37.760]  make sure you guys are getting the best clones.
[02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:41.760]  And we're like maybe he's like protected from all this stuff because
[02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:44.760]  he's on an island and he has to take a ferry and it like and
[02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:46.760]  obviously it's not a good idea to take a ferry.
[02:32:46.760 --> 02:32:48.760]  But I think it's a good idea to like.
[02:32:48.760 --> 02:32:52.760]  Take a ferry and it like and obviously it was you know in his case
[02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:55.760]  true because the plants were super healthy and awesome.
[02:32:55.760 --> 02:33:00.760]  But we go to the PM can't take a ferry which I love him can't take
[02:33:00.760 --> 02:33:02.760]  hashtag PM can't take a ferry.
[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:10.760]  But to that extent we have rigorous standards for our breeders that
[02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:11.760]  work with us.
[02:33:11.760 --> 02:33:15.760]  We want to open that channel up to more breeders next year.
[02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:17.760]  I want to have multiple competitions per state.
[02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:22.760]  If you're a breeder and you pass the bar that we've set that our next
[02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:25.760]  guest has set that has helped us get to this point making sure you
[02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:29.760]  have healthy hearty clones reach out to us.
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:32.760]  I want to do multiple breeder grow offs next year and the only way.
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:35.760]  Oh wait I didn't tell you.
[02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:40.760]  Yeah yeah yeah get yeah get out of here because I need to bring
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:42.760]  another lovely lady onto the stage.
[02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:45.760]  The only way we're able to get you guys the best healthy is make sure
[02:33:45.760 --> 02:33:48.760]  everyone's on time healthy clones I see right there Wendy Kornberg
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:52.760]  will you come on down please and let everybody know what you do why
[02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:57.760]  you're awesome and why people should do the girl off and brush breeders
[02:33:57.760 --> 02:33:59.760]  should enter this get up here.
[02:34:07.450 --> 02:34:09.450]  That is quite the dress and underdressed up here.
[02:34:11.450 --> 02:34:12.450]  All right.
[02:34:12.450 --> 02:34:14.450]  My name is Wendy Kornberg from California the outdoor state.
[02:34:14.450 --> 02:34:21.450]  No but one of the things that kind of came to fruition through this
[02:34:21.450 --> 02:34:25.450]  you know communication with Samantha was that I started entering
[02:34:25.450 --> 02:34:28.450]  the graph way back and one of the first questions I had was how do
[02:34:28.450 --> 02:34:32.450]  we make sure that the clones that I'm getting are going to be clean
[02:34:32.450 --> 02:34:37.450]  clones because I didn't realize that it is not common knowledge
[02:34:37.450 --> 02:34:40.450]  that clones can pick up all kinds of pathogens.
[02:34:40.450 --> 02:34:43.450]  One of them let me take a real quick like temperature of the audience
[02:34:43.450 --> 02:34:46.450]  raise your hand or give a shout or something if you know what hop
[02:34:46.450 --> 02:34:47.450]  latent viroid is.
[02:34:48.450 --> 02:34:50.450]  Yes he is not that big.
[02:34:50.450 --> 02:34:53.450]  Raise your hand if you've experienced top late and by right in your garden.
[02:34:54.450 --> 02:34:56.450]  It sucks you guys.
[02:34:56.450 --> 02:34:57.450]  There's my buddy back there.
[02:34:57.450 --> 02:34:58.450]  One of you had to have it.
[02:34:59.450 --> 02:35:00.450]  It sucks.
[02:35:00.450 --> 02:35:02.450]  It's called the dudding disease.
[02:35:02.450 --> 02:35:03.450]  OK.
[02:35:03.450 --> 02:35:06.450]  And it is probably the gnarliest thing you can experience because you
[02:35:06.450 --> 02:35:08.450]  don't know you have it until the end.
[02:35:08.450 --> 02:35:09.450]  So you get through your grow.
[02:35:09.450 --> 02:35:10.450]  Everything's looking good.
[02:35:10.450 --> 02:35:12.450]  And all of a sudden your plants are not budding out.
[02:35:13.450 --> 02:35:14.450]  They look squirrely.
[02:35:14.450 --> 02:35:15.450]  They look weird.
[02:35:15.450 --> 02:35:17.450]  They're foxtailing and they're just like you're like what is wrong.
[02:35:18.450 --> 02:35:20.450]  You touch it and they like bonk over and break.
[02:35:21.450 --> 02:35:23.450]  And there's no coming back from it.
[02:35:23.450 --> 02:35:27.450]  And now if you've taken clones and you were not meticulous with your
[02:35:27.450 --> 02:35:31.450]  quarantine processes you spread that disease to all your other plants
[02:35:31.450 --> 02:35:35.450]  in the garden and you gave your cut to your buddy and they have it and
[02:35:35.450 --> 02:35:36.450]  then they spread it to their buddy.
[02:35:36.450 --> 02:35:38.450]  And this is kind of what happens in the cannabis industry.
[02:35:39.450 --> 02:35:40.450]  We love to share.
[02:35:40.450 --> 02:35:43.450]  But if we're not careful we're sharing our diseases and we're sharing our
[02:35:44.450 --> 02:35:46.450]  pests and pathogens and it can really really damage people.
[02:35:47.450 --> 02:35:51.450]  So I got the prestigious job of talking to all the breeders and basically
[02:35:52.450 --> 02:35:55.450]  finding out that like oh people aren't testing for this because they don't
[02:35:55.450 --> 02:35:56.450]  really realize that it's out there.
[02:35:57.450 --> 02:36:01.450]  One of my friends is a plant entomologist sorry not an entomologist.
[02:36:02.450 --> 02:36:03.450]  She is a plant entomologist.
[02:36:03.450 --> 02:36:04.450]  Not for plants for bugs.
[02:36:05.450 --> 02:36:08.450]  And she has friends that are plant pathologists and talking with them.
[02:36:09.450 --> 02:36:10.450]  It's crazy you guys.
[02:36:11.450 --> 02:36:15.450]  There are a lot of diseases that can transfer from plant to plant to plant.
[02:36:16.450 --> 02:36:20.450]  So you know we really kind of got after everybody and said you have to test
[02:36:21.450 --> 02:36:22.450]  your genetics.
[02:36:22.450 --> 02:36:26.450]  If you're a breeder and you want to give people clones and I'm talking
[02:36:27.450 --> 02:36:29.450]  like pollen checkers too because I'm a massive pollen checker.
[02:36:30.450 --> 02:36:32.450]  I love breeding but I don't really like pollens.
[02:36:33.450 --> 02:36:36.450]  I don't really you know do it the way that these amazing breeders do that are
[02:36:37.450 --> 02:36:39.450]  our partners with this with this competition.
[02:36:40.450 --> 02:36:44.450]  And yeah it was it was surprising to find out how few people actually are
[02:36:45.450 --> 02:36:46.450]  testing or were testing.
[02:36:47.450 --> 02:36:48.450]  So we were rigorous.
[02:36:49.450 --> 02:36:50.450]  We're like you guys have to get your genetics tested.
[02:36:51.450 --> 02:36:53.450]  They have to come back free of hoplite and viroid and other pathogens.
[02:36:54.450 --> 02:36:58.450]  And that way everybody who enters this competition is able to know that they
[02:36:59.450 --> 02:37:00.450]  have something that's really clean.
[02:37:01.450 --> 02:37:02.450]  It's not going to mess up their grows.
[02:37:03.450 --> 02:37:06.450]  So if you're a breeder out there and you want to join this is a massive
[02:37:07.450 --> 02:37:09.450]  opportunity you guys like it's huge.
[02:37:10.450 --> 02:37:11.450]  Genetics are so much fun.
[02:37:12.450 --> 02:37:13.450]  I love talking with breeders.
[02:37:14.450 --> 02:37:15.450]  I love talking about genetics.
[02:37:16.450 --> 02:37:20.450]  It's super cool and it's a great opportunity to launch yourself from like I
[02:37:21.450 --> 02:37:24.450]  mean Martha's Vineyard tiny tiny place the fact that they come all the way
[02:37:25.450 --> 02:37:26.450]  over here and be talking to us.
[02:37:27.450 --> 02:37:28.450]  We have breeders in Hawaii.
[02:37:29.450 --> 02:37:31.450]  We have breeders in Colorado you know California like all these states
[02:37:31.450 --> 02:37:33.450]  Massachusetts Maine you know Virginia.
[02:37:34.450 --> 02:37:35.450]  We want to take this.
[02:37:36.450 --> 02:37:38.450]  This should be everywhere to be in every state and everybody who makes clones or
[02:37:39.450 --> 02:37:42.450]  seeds should want to do this as long as you're willing to make sure you're
[02:37:43.450 --> 02:37:44.450]  clean and tested.
[02:37:45.450 --> 02:37:48.450]  So everybody you know get your genetics in do this next year.
[02:37:49.450 --> 02:37:51.450]  This is it'll be the first year it's open to anybody.
[02:37:52.450 --> 02:37:53.450]  Huge massive opportunity.
[02:37:54.450 --> 02:37:55.450]  So I highly encourage you all to take it.
[02:37:56.450 --> 02:37:57.450]  Thank you.
[02:37:58.450 --> 02:37:59.450]  Thank you so much.
[02:37:59.450 --> 02:38:00.450]  You're the best.
[02:38:01.450 --> 02:38:02.450]  All right.
[02:38:03.450 --> 02:38:05.450]  And seriously if anyone thinks that they pass that test they have to answer to
[02:38:06.450 --> 02:38:07.450]  Wendy first and then let us know.
[02:38:08.450 --> 02:38:09.450]  Hey I just have everybody in the room.
[02:38:10.450 --> 02:38:11.450]  Give it up for Wendy Korver.
[02:38:12.450 --> 02:38:17.510]  OK let's do some more awards shall we.
[02:38:18.510 --> 02:38:19.510]  Yes.
[02:38:20.510 --> 02:38:21.510]  Definitely everybody wants awards.
[02:38:22.510 --> 02:38:23.510]  OK so this one's interesting.
[02:38:24.510 --> 02:38:25.510]  This is a new state for us.
[02:38:26.510 --> 02:38:27.510]  We decided Virginia's pop in.
[02:38:28.510 --> 02:38:29.510]  People are talking about Virginia.
[02:38:30.510 --> 02:38:31.510]  Maryland just went legal.
[02:38:32.510 --> 02:38:36.510]  So with any new state it's a challenge for us to get the word out.
[02:38:37.510 --> 02:38:40.510]  We all spend all the time in the grow and it's hard for us to be like hey
[02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:42.510]  pay attention.
[02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:44.510]  This is fun.
[02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:46.510]  You should do this.
[02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:49.510]  So quite frankly we had one person submit in Virginia.
[02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:53.510]  So what that means is we have we know the best we know the best grower in
[02:38:54.510 --> 02:38:55.510]  Virginia.
[02:38:56.510 --> 02:38:59.510]  But there's also room for more folks in the DMV and everywhere else in the
[02:38:59.510 --> 02:39:00.510]  country to be on this stage with us.
[02:39:01.510 --> 02:39:03.510]  This is the hardest competition that any grower will ever do.
[02:39:04.510 --> 02:39:05.510]  This is a testament to that.
[02:39:06.510 --> 02:39:08.510]  And so I want to congratulate the best grower in Virginia.
[02:39:09.510 --> 02:39:11.510]  I don't know if he wants me to say his name.
[02:39:12.510 --> 02:39:13.510]  Are you here.
[02:39:14.510 --> 02:39:15.510]  No he's not here.
[02:39:16.510 --> 02:39:17.510]  What.
[02:39:18.510 --> 02:39:19.510]  Don't do it.
[02:39:20.510 --> 02:39:21.510]  Jay his initials are J.D.
[02:39:22.510 --> 02:39:23.510]  And he said craft grow.
[02:39:24.510 --> 02:39:25.510]  So we just give it up for craft growing.
[02:39:26.510 --> 02:39:27.510]  Best grower in Virginia.
[02:39:27.510 --> 02:39:28.510]  Best grower in Virginia.
[02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:30.510]  Congratulations.
[02:39:31.510 --> 02:39:33.510]  I hope you're watching and DMV show up next year.
[02:39:34.510 --> 02:39:35.510]  We want to see more of you.
[02:39:36.510 --> 02:39:37.510]  Honestly we're just giving away free belts.
[02:39:38.510 --> 02:39:39.510]  That's J.D.'s.
[02:39:40.510 --> 02:39:41.510]  Oh OK.
[02:39:42.510 --> 02:39:43.510]  But can I wear them.
[02:39:44.510 --> 02:39:45.510]  J.D. comment if I can.
[02:39:46.510 --> 02:39:47.510]  All right.
[02:39:48.510 --> 02:39:51.510]  Next up we are going to wrap up the Eastern time zone at like 2 a.m.
[02:39:52.510 --> 02:39:53.510]  their time.
[02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:54.510]  Hey everybody.
[02:39:54.510 --> 02:39:55.510]  Glad you stay awake.
[02:39:55.510 --> 02:39:58.510]  We're going to wrap up the Eastern time zone with Michigan which I don't
[02:39:58.510 --> 02:40:00.510]  understand how they're on the Eastern time zone doesn't make any sense.
[02:40:01.510 --> 02:40:02.510]  They don't either but it's great for them.
[02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:04.510]  All right.
[02:40:04.510 --> 02:40:08.510]  So when I met our breeder that our genetics partner from Michigan he was
[02:40:09.510 --> 02:40:12.510]  running around an event talking about you guys are giving out clothes to
[02:40:13.510 --> 02:40:14.510]  keep them clean.

[02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:18.510]  He seems grumpy.
[02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:20.510]  I was like wait.

[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:08.320]  tax-free purchasing really matters for patients being able to

[02:51:00.370 --> 02:51:01.570]  He's a fucking man
[02:51:01.570 --> 02:51:07.650]  and he's partnering with Maine to figure out how to like copy their pro like do the same thing as your program and
[02:51:07.650 --> 02:51:12.690]  Is somebody who's in a state where he's has no support and he's just trying to make it happen
[02:51:12.690 --> 02:51:16.650]  so I mean those are the people that we love to fucking help and
[02:51:17.170 --> 02:51:19.170]  true that

[02:51:25.170 --> 02:51:31.770]  I think we told y'all that it was from King Kamehameha the eighth which is amazing like this strain is like
[02:51:32.170 --> 02:51:37.370]  Generational and the strain was Puna butter and we don't know what the cross is
[02:51:37.370 --> 02:51:42.810]  But it was gifted to Jason and I'm so glad that he gifted it to our Hawaii participants
[02:51:42.810 --> 02:51:45.530]  and now let's announce who they are because yes
[02:51:46.130 --> 02:51:48.130]  people flew here from Hawaii

[02:56:35.220 --> 02:56:36.180]  but
[02:56:36.180 --> 02:56:40.740]  Thankfully we have the good lab that allows home growers and caregivers to do their testing
[02:56:41.300 --> 02:56:43.820]  Give it up for Terry and Greg. Thank you both
[02:56:44.940 --> 02:56:47.860]  Okay, where are we gonna start? We're gonna start with

[02:57:30.860 --> 02:57:37.980]  Can I get a another gut check? How many people in this room have ever grown cannabis before raise hands? I
[02:57:40.180 --> 02:57:44.580]  Feel like some of you think that you're being live-streamed this way, okay
[02:57:44.580 --> 02:57:49.260]  We think it's all good. But you know what? We're an honest competition with honest participants
[02:57:49.260 --> 02:57:53.820]  so they'll tell us if we when we're check the receipts, but I'm pretty sure we're accurate here cuz
