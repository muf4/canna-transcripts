[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  I'm Herzog, Herzog from Germany, Berlin.
[00:03.000 --> 00:10.000]  Okay, and tell me, from Germany, what are you doing? What do you have here?
[00:10.000 --> 00:18.000]  Well, I'm working together with Exotic Seeds. We developed our new project, My Strain.
[00:18.000 --> 00:22.000]  It's a cross of Larry OG and Koshy Kush. We named it after me.
[00:22.000 --> 00:28.000]  There are lots of OGs out there, you know, and ocean grown it is actually, right?
[00:28.000 --> 00:34.000]  And my name is spelled the same way, H-E-R-Z-O-G, Herzog.
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.000]  And we split that up and made a perfect Herz OG.
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  And yeah, that's how we called The Strain. It's a cross of two of my favorites.
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  That's very nice. And which is the characteristic of the OG?
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  It's a strong and happy high. The best you want, right? Best of both worlds.
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  You can laugh your ass off and sweat like a motherfucker because you think you're tripping.
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  Would you say that it's a little bit more higher or something?
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  It's a hybrid, you know? You get everything. It hits your head and it hits your body.
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  You really get a full body stone and creative high, actually.
[01:19.000 --> 01:27.000]  And it tastes like a little bit woody, a little bit earthy with notes of marshmallow and honey.
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.000]  So it has this little gassy, earthy touch with a sweetness at the end.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  So it's really, really awesome. Delicious. I love it.
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.000]  Tasty.
[01:38.000 --> 01:39.000]  Yes.
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  And in the whole years that you have been in the cannabis world, in a way to say,
[01:46.000 --> 01:55.000]  have you noticed any big change in the taste of the customer or the public?
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.000]  Well, there are lots of new C-Pangs out here.
[02:01.000 --> 02:09.000]  Everybody is growing and everybody is developing. Everybody is bringing out new strains.
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  It's a really progressive business, you know?
[02:14.000 --> 02:17.000]  Everybody wants to push the frontier.
[02:17.000 --> 02:24.000]  We all want the worldwide legalization so we can traffic cannabis globally.
[02:24.000 --> 02:25.000]  That would be awesome.
[02:25.000 --> 02:34.000]  I'm actually right now working in Europe with kilos of CBD, you know, throughout Europe.
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  Because it got this medical aspect, which is really important to me also.
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.000]  But it's also important to bring up the structures for the future.
[02:46.000 --> 02:52.000]  When THC is legal, we have already set up all the structures, you know?
[02:52.000 --> 02:55.000]  That was really important. That's why we started with that.
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.000]  So we are freaking grossing that it's something that happened fast.
[02:59.000 --> 03:06.000]  Well, everything that wants to turn out fine and good has to take its time, you know?
[03:07.000 --> 03:16.000]  You got to be patient, you got to be confident and you got to visualize the future and the upcoming events,
[03:16.000 --> 03:23.000]  which may be mostly positive and in a good way for the legalization, right?
[03:23.000 --> 03:32.230]  And if I ask you now, what is the seed between your seed and the rest of the seed?
[03:32.230 --> 03:38.230]  We put much more love in it. We put our guts in it. We put our balls in it.
[03:38.230 --> 03:40.230]  And we put our brain in it, you know?
[03:40.230 --> 03:44.230]  We live for the plant, we die for the plant and we're pushing frontiers.
[03:45.230 --> 03:47.230]  Yes, we push that thing.
[03:47.230 --> 03:48.230]  Now we have to check it out.
[03:48.230 --> 03:50.230]  Yeah, you have to, of course.
[03:50.230 --> 03:52.230]  That was Herzog here with...
[03:52.230 --> 03:53.230]  Giancarlo.
[03:53.230 --> 03:56.230]  Giancarlo. Thank you so much for your time. It has been a pleasure.
[03:56.230 --> 03:58.230]  It was a pleasure. Bye.
