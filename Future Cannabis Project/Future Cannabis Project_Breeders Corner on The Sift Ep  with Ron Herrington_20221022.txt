Well, hello everybody. Welcome to another episode of the SIFT. Today we're gonna go
to Barcelona, Spain to talk to my friend, who's down there working on some seeds.
And there he is. Actually we're in Santiago, Chile. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm dreaming, I'm
dreaming there. I was talking to someone earlier today. Yeah, Santiago. Yeah, nice to
see you Ron. Yeah, this is Jason. Jay, he's bred lots of different strains. He's been
around the game for the duration of his life, I'm sure, as long as I have. And tell us a
little bit about yourself, Jay. Go into a few of your high time stories or some of the
stuff. Yeah, well I started breeding about 25, 26 years ago in Vancouver. And I started
at the beginning of the scene when Mark Emery and all that was kicking off. I got into the
seed breeding game right away. And mostly just breeding regular seeds with all the varieties
and meeting all the growers in British Columbia. There was an insane amount of genetics we
had access to. And yeah, and I started working with High Times and Jorge Cervantes with some
of their High Times movies. And I had quite a few articles in High Times. I did several
trips to Morocco with Nicolas Candido to explore the hashish market in Morocco. And
it made a lot of articles about my outdoor growing on Vancouver Island, where I developed
a lot of mold resistant, fast flowering outdoor strains. That was always a tough challenge
on Vancouver Island to breed strains that were mold resistant and it rained all the
time. But yeah, varieties that were that really stand, you know, stand ahead of everything
else for mold resistance. But since then, after about 12, 13 years in Canada, I moved
our operation to Valencia, Spain, and spent almost a decade there. And learning how to
feminize and I created some of my auto flower varieties in Spain. I got the technique down
with some of the growers there. And then once legalization happened, I came back to
Canada. And yeah, the legalization in Canada for me has been a bit of a disappointment.
But so I'm, the market is still outside of Canada. So even though I'm Canadian born and
bred, most of our markets still in Europe or in the US. And it looks like South America
is going to be a really great market.
Great, great. That's good to hear. What, what we're into breeding here, we talk a lot about
breeding and specifically how to sift for things. And one thing with auto flowers is
something that I've worked on honing my skills to sift. Tell us a little, I when I let me
tell you a little about how I sift and I'll hear how you do the autos. I'll run like 20
autos and I'll reverse all 20 autos. And then I'll have like 20 or 100 targets, right? And
so what I'll do is I'll go through my donors and I'll knock out three quarters of those
donors as they're, as they're building, you know, I'll go and smell the turps and I'll
pick out, I'll sift the donors even before I put them on the rest of them. And then I
put the pollen on the rest of them. And then when I'm done with that, I'll sift those as
well. And I'll throw three quarters, if not more of those in the trash. Basically, I saw
I threw three quarters of my pollen donors in the trash in a sift. And then I'm throwing
three quarters of the seed I made away because it's it's under it's not chosen. How do you
go about your shifting in autos? Very, very similar to the way I do it. I do the STS on
way more pollen donors than I need and then only select the ones with traits that I'm
looking for. And like you say, probably about two quarters of them go in the trash. Right.
Because yeah, to have the good seed you can't be, you know, they don't know when you're
doing the auto flower feminized. It's not like you can keep a clone and select it and
go back again. You're doing it's a one. So yeah, it's tricky. It's tricky to sift on
that I just kind of had to fly by the seat of my pants to figure out, all right, how
am I going to do this because I need to be able to sift and this stuff is automatic.
So I've been actually sifting to some I sift to the early flowers, but I took it another
direction and I turn the other way and I picked the last one out of 25 to flip and
I've been using those the last and I've got autos that are 130 days it'll grow to seven
feet and you can't tell them I've gone two directions with autos and I don't know if
they're autos anymore. I don't I don't know what they are because I can plan them and
you can even keep a clone if you got 24 hours a lot you can keep them from flipping.
Closer to the fast buds type of genetics when they're longer flowering like that you
can select with some I've noticed as well too or the ones that are really sativa dominant
like the amnesia haze and varieties like that you probably have more experience with those
than I do. I got amnesia. I don't have amnesia in an auto unfortunately, but I do have some
of the others and I've I've even converted a Grim Spoon to an auto. So like like a 14
week flowering thin leaf sativa to the bone right? This thing is ridiculous and it's just
hairy and stuff and I've crossed that into stuff and I'm going to try to mess around
with that to see if I can make an auto that can can flip like in and like as quick as
possible and then take three months to flower. Okay. Yeah, I know the autos when you're starting
with a pure variety it takes at least about four generations before they're really four
generations of selecting before you really can really consistently call them all an auto.
Yeah, the first couple of generations are real rough. I did I took my into an auto.
Yeah, the first one is bad.
Now you get a bunch of fast flowers and then so it grows up and then you've got like
seven foot fast flowers that are just flipping and then underneath it you've got autos that
are completely done and they're already harvested out of there. Yeah, you breed those in different
directions and yeah end up with so many you see a lot of different traits especially in the first
years of breeding auto flowers. Now stabilizing because they've been around the market and people
have been experimenting long enough that I know it's the first few years by grapefruit haze.
The different phenotypes that would come out were insane but now it's getting dialed in every year
it's getting better. Yeah, so what's the story what's the backstory of Island's Week Skunk?
That's one that I it's got such an interesting profile. I took it down south and it had the
CBG in it and I like it. What's the back story? Where did it come from?
Well, it was originally a breeder Steve Spice of Life selection and I believe it was a Northern
Lights haze with the original sweet pink grapefruit. Steve had four different cuts.
The cut that I used was the most sativa dominant and probably the stinkiest and it was probably
originally about 11 weeks flower and through my years of selecting it's down to about a nine and
a half nine and a half to ten depending actually it's one of those strains that depends a lot
on your growing method and how heavily it's ferted on how long it's flowering time. You can bring it
down sometimes as fast as nine weeks in certain conditions but I've seen people take it as long
as 12. Yeah and you've probably seen the same as well with the sweet skunk. Yeah, I grew it out to
11 weeks actually when I grew up but it was outside right so outside is different than indoor.
Yeah, I bet yeah I never recommend that as an outdoor strain in Canada of course. Yeah,
but below the 35th parallel in the U.S. amazing results. I've heard from people in Texas and
Southern California. You show amazing. Yeah, that's an interesting thought like I breed everything
since I live up here in where Santa Claus lives that I have a really really you know how
pardon my French no how horrible the weather is up here it's like living on
Jupiter and I've got I've been using it to my benefit. I water my plants with river water all
the way up to week five of flowers spray it all over the plants and if they can rot I rot them
and now I've got the more I'm doing this I got strains that'll keep growing and they'll grow all
the way up to my plastic and turn and grow sideways across the plastic of the greenhouse
and it won't rot. It won't rot. Yeah, yeah, yeah and the plastic boy when that bud is all flat and
grown against the plastic that will make anything rot you know and so I've got them now so rot
resistant up here. I think that the very best thing I did for my breeding game is to move up
from the 30th parallel up here to the the the north where I'm at like 43 or whatever I don't
know what Edmonton is but it's it's it's pretty north. So some of the varieties you brought from
Oregon State years ago I know Oregon I believe is there's a lot of rain just like Vancouver Island.
I imagine a lot of your strains already had some of that mold resistance just selected into them.
About half of them yeah. Yeah I often only use these selective 22 strains that I use to cross
against new stuff. Let's say like from exotic seeds I got one that was really nice smelling
called Red Delicious and and man it smelled like apples and it was great right but it but it rots
like a rots like right now so so I'm crossing it to these other ones that I know a bunch of
different ways so I can get a phenotype that smells like the apple but won't rot.
So yeah the California strains but especially the coastal stuff not so much the stuff that was from
the high high desert like from Barstow or you know where it's dry none of that sort of stuff but
the stuff that's grown out towards the coast and also on the coast in Oregon right there
northern Cal I own property right on northern in northern Cal and the inland stuff didn't do the
stuff that was growing at higher elevations didn't do anything like the stuff that that people grew
that was like that caught that beach the the humidity that comes off the beach that's every
single night just just like they're bucketed water on it and those are the ones that really
don't rot. Yeah that's like like my Avalon strain I bred on the one of the wettest parts of Vancouver
Island because there's no other growers there and the first few years of selecting we would
lose probably about 60-70 percent to rot and then I would just do selection that and the next year do
it again and by about by about the third or fourth year of doing my select selecting 90 percent of
them could get through two weeks of that rain and sun and rain back and forth that happens in
the first of September without a problem and that's why my old Avalon variety which I just
brought back in feminized form a few months ago it was out of stock for nearly 10 years and I brought
that back again and that's what it was especially in the east coast the farmers in Nova Scotia
Newfoundland New Brunswick loved it because it could take those those heavy winds and the
rains that they would get also in September and you've got my variety got very well known in Nova
Scotia and Newfoundland and the people out there how cold can you go um it can it can do a few minus
two three four but that's pushing it uh that's really pushing it I've got one that that that
that uh is being studied right now at the University of Quebec uh I I don't remember the name of the
university but it's 35 percent more water efficient than any strain that they've ever tested and it
went three it went three weeks with no water they've never had one that that you could not
water for three weeks and then they just start watering and it just kicked right back into to
full gear again wow that's something we should that same one it's good to minus five okay
do you mean uh uh drought resistant uh is that drought resistant well I'm actually I've been
talking with um negotiating with some farmers in Morocco and uh they've been growing they've moved
from their traditional varieties to the Pakistani varieties and now they're they're desperately
searching for varieties that are drought resistant oh wow I've got one that would be uh that'd be one
too uh we should talk about uh now we will have to yeah they have about go ahead tell us a little
bit about what's going on at the show yeah you said you're at a booth uh that's working uh that's
talking about the history of hemp and is that in South America or worldwide yeah yeah in in
South America mostly are did we freeze a little I think we might have had a short pause
Jay if you can hear us you've frozen for a moment
no we can't we're just getting into good business he was about to tell us where he was and what was
going on man yeah well he's at Expo Weed in Chile and uh they don't have really good internet in that
facility and there's like thousands of people so so uh who knows what what would happen well that's
what we do here is get like all the way down to live on location at a at a C-Day Expo now
Ron uh while he's trying to probably figure out how to get back on and stuff like that
so you you mentioned Ron like I'm familiar with Next Generation seeds like I've seen this brand
around and about before I've I've seen it on True North Seed Bank as a Canadian guy I've seen it
here and there like what are some of the things that that they're known for do you know like what
are some of the things that well the ones that I really like that he bred was the Island Sweet
Skunk which is really really nice it's got a sweetness a good uh good nose it's very nice
and it's also got a skunk in it so and that makes sense because he was just saying it had
like the skunk number one in it or something so it seems to make sense so I really like that one
and then he's got a grapefruit haze which is really nice and then of course the Romulan which
I don't know if he exactly came up with it but the Romulan's out there and he was able to
resurrect it and I think he has it in Feminized Seeds now and that's a nice one but uh the
grapefruit is a really nice one Romulan's like a BC legend yeah it's been around for a long time
it's like that uh who is it people are trying to get the guy that invented as a calculator who did
Mac one and they're trying to get him to talk about it and but but sometimes I wonder I don't
know who came up with this stuff none of us invented it so we're just lucky enough to hunt
it out of a a whole pile of genetics but uh people come up with what they come up with and
and and we're all building on the backs of some other a guy who who maybe he's been making a
dollar a month you know growing in in Afghanistan or whatever and and he's the guy who came up with
it but he probably just got it from someone else so who knows yeah it's funny and then
there's all these claims that get made and then I think one of the funnier things that happen and
that we've been talking about a little bit too is like you have like a regional thing like
Tix-Tixada Time Warp or like this may not be the greatest example but there's like
trying to think of the best reference skunk is probably the best is is regionally there were a
whole bunch of people that had skunk right but they all grew up and had one particular skunk
from whether it was Sweet Island from BC or whether it was down there but they were all
referred to as skunk depending on who they are so I find there's this interesting kind of almost
because of where you're located what you're doing your opinions are different on what these things
actually taste and look like and stuff like that so it's been kind of an interesting
kind of perspective to have yeah I came from Southern California and and so we we seem to
see it all down there for a while and then I moved to Northern California and then the
Amsterdam genetics came in and like we're everywhere so I saw the the skunk so yeah
I guess everybody does have a here's how to tell if you're smelling a skunk if you crack a Corona
beer right when you crack the bottle and you open the top and then you smell it you will get
hints of that of the the skunk right there that that that piss smell that kind of comes out a
little bit yeah this is a bad word it's not piss it's like it's wonderful aromatic it's like smelling
just good stuff well your gear is like your gear has got some of that weirdness to it that kind of
fun that's in there too I've been enjoying smoking that quite a bit actually now while we're on to
it like some of the things that a lot of people are running into especially a lot of like passionate
new home breeders people that are trying to play around with you know pollen chucking at home for
the first time and it's fall so and I've got you so like let's talk a little bit about seed strategy
while we're kind of seeing if Jay comes back it's like what are your methodologies for harvesting
seed like we've taken the plant down we've got it hung and dried out ready to go or actually would
you do anything different for the flower when it came to taking the plant down for seed and for the
dry and the cure than you would for a flower product or do you treat it relatively the same
it's depending on what I'm going to do with the wash after it's done if I don't give a flip and
it's a whole bunch of stuff that I'm just testing to try to burn through and I'm not yeah then I
will take it and I'll just hang it up get it bone dry as fast as possible and as dry as possible
so I can just go with gloves on and have it fall apart and then I'll shake it through a sieve
which will let all the trichomes and the the nasty weed fall out the bottom and then I I take at the
seed and the stems and I get as many stems as I can out and I take a blow dryer and blow it in the
special stainless steel bowl that I have and all the stems and everything comes out the only thing
left in the bowl is seeds so that's that's how I do it but if if it was really really good weed
like I'm I'm doing the runt series I've got 16 different ruts strains and they're all fantastic
and even with seeds on them they're fantastic so what I did is that as I hung it and cured it
just like I would regular weed is slow cure ice cold you know 60 degrees humidity as you know I
kept it quite cold and and and I cure it and then I have to dry it after it's done the cure and I
have locked up my my terpenes locked into there at that point and so I'll hang dry for five weeks
until it's all just where I want it and then I'll squeeze I'll shake it out and I'll save all the
sift and I'll wash that and it'll make a wonderful wonderful hash that looks like you you have in the
background that looks like my plants I see Seattle Space Needle up here and it's interesting
is that that's my that's my grow no no this is um looks familiar this is dragonfly dragonfly
the image that you have on the sift logo that's in in the background oh yeah that's the that's
the shot you sent me that's your weed for sure yeah okay because I I say I see up there Seattle
Space Needle I see the chem dog I see right below that uh uh mac lime and yeah I see strains that I
I know well it's definitely should be because it's your photo yeah okay that makes I just noticed
that I wasn't paying attention I'll highlight that for a second because it's it's pretty close
beautiful yeah so you so depending on how you would do it right like so a lot of these home
growers are probably trying to preserve as much as they can and process as much as they can they're
not they don't have a bunch of excess that they produce each year so they're probably going to
take that delicate route so you take the traditional dry tested that you would do any other ganja if
you want to preserve the cannabis as well as the seeds correct correct do that and then and then
you want to dry it in bowls at at room temperature at room and then put like I keep like little uh
cereal bowls and I have them all full of seeds never more than like an inch deep right and then
I just go around and I stir it up every so often and let them dry for like a month and then after
a month I'll put them in jars with desiccant packs in them and keep them dry sometimes uh if I have a
seed that I want to remove any chance of mold on the outside like I'm going to ship it somewhere or
something I'll wash it with a hydrogen peroxide really quick prior to that drying uh time but then
once it's dry for a month I can put it in the the pack the uh with desiccant to keep it dead dry
and then if I'm going to use it again in the next four to five years I don't need to refrigerate it
it'll keep uh at room temperature you know for a long time and so that's what I I do a lot I I do a
lot of consulting I have uh Wildwood Cannabis Consulting and let's say a person in Colorado
wants to has a strain that they're LP and they really love this strain and they they're scared
that they're going to lose it or scared they're going to get viral contamination and lose it at
some time so you want to preserve that strain in seed form so that you could recover it it's like
you don't talk on you don't make a big document on your computer and don't save it right
so so I work I work with people online for for just a small fee and I wind up sending them the
STS and everything they need and I get with them on a Skype call and they show me their plant just
like you and I are talking I say okay here's where you want to spray it here's what you want to do
here's when you want to do it and they always keep in contact and then we reverse their plants and
they have a couple of clones and so they reverse one and put it on to uh and they're exact copies
right they're all clones put them on a couple others so they get a bunch of seeds then they
save those seeds and if they ever needed to they could sift their same selection back out of those
seeds so uh and any advantage of that first yeah any one the s1 the first generation they're not
going any further yes they're actually s1s uh which would be self ones but it won't give you
the the crazy f1 like if if you're line breeding depends on how well you line breed like I'll line
breed stuff out you know so I got some stuff that's been line bred 16 generations with with uh
so it's like f16 you know I self it or I I pick out this the selections that I want and then I
self them and I do that how long did f16 take well I'm not done I I do not quit if I got something
that I want to save like I've got the most stunning wedding cake anybody could ever have ever
and I use that in breeding but I have it so many times back against itself that we planted an entire
room of wedding cake from seed that I did and you would lose a bet that it was cloned because they
were identical the tops were identical it was smooth all the way the testing was identical
everything but that's the one that's that's gone so many times I just constantly reset it and using
it and I a lot of people really like it they grow the heck out of it and I crossed it with cherry
pie and that turns out and I have a really old cherry pie that has THCV in it or no uh CBG in it
and that's the one that I crossed with it and that strain is the one that's 35 percent more water
efficient than than any strain that they've tested so far and it's good minus two it finishes early
uh it's nice so that's what they people can do I'm getting long-winded but anybody can take
if you got the strain that you love whether you're an LP or whoever you got the strain that you love
you can cross it into seeds and that way you can give that to friends uh if you give them 20 seeds
and it's it's pretty stable from the get-go they're going to be able to recuperate or regenerate
exactly basically like you gave them a cut so what do you what what's kind of like because we're
talking about self in here and stressing out a plant to produce hermaphroditic flowers how do
you know how do you like secure the stability of a plant like can you just grab anything off the
shelf that you that you find a seed variety because that's what a lot of people the first
thing they're going to do is they're going to go on their crop king seed site you know guys just a
heads up we do have dagga dot garden you can get beans there fucking good stuff too um but they're
going to go and they're going to get maybe something feminized maybe some of this some of
that it doesn't matter what it is and they're going to find something that they're going to like
and they're going to want to do it now is now you know some people are just going to shoot the gun
and go for it um but is there something that somebody that wants to take a little bit more
time to make sure the stability is there before they ask to want it um is there something they
can do yeah if it's something that they love this is what i do all the time i'm always working 30 to
50 lines so i have 30 to 50 different unrelated or semi-related lines i'm always running at any
one time so that i can see what's under the hood so like if i had a new seed that you just loved
and you said look i'm going to give you a thousand bucks make me some seeds of exactly this
you know i i could do it but uh probably not for that but i could do it what i would do is i would
take that seed or that cut that you gave me i would self it and then i would grow out at least
160 of that plant and that way i would know every single thing that that plant is capable of or most
of it except for what's recessive that needs to be crossed to something else that has a trigger
to turn that on but i could see the expression of your clone in from many different angles so it's
like taking a picture of london from the front from the back from the side from the top from
under you know you're able to see all that's in that that that genetic and then that's when the
sift comes in you go okay this is what i like this is not what i like this one has spaghetti stems
but it smells great and this other one has that same smell but good structure but the bud structure
is too open or whatever so you you you pick what you want and what you want is what you started
with right that's the goal you always have a plan and so you always try to go back to to home base
and take it back there and then self it again and then self it against to one of the new creations
right or a couple of the new creations and then you keep those separate and then you grow up
populations from them and that's how you truncate a a strain down to getting more and more and more
consistent like i'm working with one that i really love that i got that the terpenes just
they set me off they're just wonderful it's called red delicious from exotic seeds except
where we planted a 10 pack i think and and it was all over the place right it was this and that and
the other thing and uh but some of it was really amazing so i self the some the one that was amazing
and i'm growing out a population of that and then i was able to search and get it more i i'm going
to take that strain and clean it up because it's just amazing and then i once i get it to be
foundational or completely cleaned up then i can use it to work with those turps to bring it to
some of the other 22 foundation strains that i have but i i am just on fire with the turps at that
the red delicious has got the most juicy turps that i've smelt since i yeah i just they're they're
good that's interesting so are there signs when you plant that 160 plant population to take all
those photographs are there images or signs or things that will go hey this is a warning sign
that there's something possibly destructive because you've talked about things like tomato varieties
being bred for breaking essentially like they just go shitty after they self themselves so you
only get one variety so people have to buy seeds every year are there signs or things in like those
160 populations that are like hey i need to stay the fuck away from this yeah yeah there's gonna
be hellish yeah they're deal breakers sometimes you you'll grow them up and then all of a sudden
you see seeds right that's that's a deal breaker or uh sometimes internally on the stock right under
the petiole it'll come out with this little thing i call the chinese lantern it's it's a ball a
single ball that grows out and it's dangling from a little mini petiole you know and that little
ball's dangling there when you see those that's the time to give up you know the juice ain't gonna
be worth the squeeze you're you're gonna have a hard time getting it out so uh when you look at
cannabis strains i i think there's about four big uh well there's a lot more but there's there's
certain plants sort of the three to five leaf finger fans which is more the ruderalis the
the they go that way and then you have your five to seven which is more your
your basic and then you get into your cookies and they got the seven to eleven you know you've got
these different different ones with the smaller ones and then you've got different strains with
long petioles like you have the fan on the end of a long stem coming out or you have like a little
short stem and the the leaf there so there's different ones and you just have to learn what
morphologies work good with other morphologies so that because otherwise you can paint yourself
into a corner breeding you can you can just select yourself into a trash bag you know so
and i've done that so it's a i'm not talking uh i've grown stuff it's elephant ears and it's just
uh just miserable you know so it's it's fun to do i mean who who doesn't love it i i i hear you got
seeds coming out your ears uh there yeah that's that's well i think i think that the the down
harney that that every pollen chucker loves about a breeder like yourself because you're a breeder
you you've done the time you've done the effort you you you really know the ins and outs and you
really work a line and and everything trying to do these unique and special things and for a guy
like me that's just like i want to just see what's going on like there especially when i find two
unique plants or two plants that are different from the the typical variety a lot of the a lot
of what's on the market that i find right now is your is your is like just this heavily regular
kind of bland tasting not enjoyable thing but there are like some varieties that i've gotten
a hold of like this lemon headband that i have from humble seed organization and while the seed
wasn't super consistent the beans that they're not the beans but the the plant that i got out of it
is this beautiful lemon flavor that's unique compared to any other lemon i've ever had before
it's not like that hazy like high tony whizzy lemon at all it's more like um grandma's old
candy that sits on the counter that lemon candy maybe those lemon rinds dried lemon rinds that
sat around too long like almost a little dusty like old dry lemon candy and it's just so different
from a lot of the lemons that i see out there so it's like i love exploring through those things
and that's what's so passionate so much fun especially when we get to talk to someone like
yourself gets to go through it all so what what was like what did you breed yourself into a corner
what was that thing you did that wasn't as fun as you you plan is there a good example is there one
or two is there original original gelato times mac one is a train wreck you gotta you gotta be
careful um with mac mac one it's it can be super stretchy gassy you know it's got it's got its own
following you know it's definitely a viable good thing i like it you know but you gotta yeah some
stuff just doesn't play well with others you know like like i've got some some sour diesel that goes
way back and i've got chem dog i've got chemberry diesel and a bunch well if you try to cross those
to anything that's a terpenelein dominant or or even a lemon they'll steal the show that just
they don't play well with others it's like having a guy on your podcast with a bigger mouth than me
that's always talking about what they do and how they do it better than everybody else and we do
this and that you know it's and won't give out you know information you know it's kind of like that
you know they're just uh they don't chem any of the chem lines play good with each other but they
don't uh play good when you you you go out of their genre so it's like uh me if i go to a
sophisticated black tie tuxedo ball i'm gonna say something that's stupid and i'm gonna i'm gonna
just regret what i said have a pinch mark on your thigh from yeah yeah
yeah you're married you know how that goes you know lucky i yeah oh i've said that so yeah there's
there's ways you can pay that to to get yourself at a really big corner you gotta know when to give
up with breeding uh if you start with really good stuff you you can go really good places and that's
why i only have 22 foundation strains that i use that i know they're tested they're stable they're
like f million they're just trustable and i use those to mine i call it strip mining i go to every
single genetic that i can get that i grow out that i go this is nice in this way or that way or some
way and i'll and i'll cross some of my stuff into that and then i'll grow out a population of that
and see what i get that's how i i hunt new stuff up but is that like is that like a dominancy
recessive hunt kind of like hey i know kind of this plant always has a really dominant this trait
so if i put it into that it usually always has it and if the other plant you know somehow
manages to over dominate that plant you're like okay well that's interesting and we can see that
happening here so we know what's going to happen later on is that kind of what you're trying to do
is make a road map introvert extrovert thing you know you got you got some straight like some
strains are really sweet and wonderful like some people like like the old cherry pie that i have
it doesn't matter what you cross it with it'll add frost it'll add a structure it'll add everything
but it's not going to steal the show terpene wise right it's very malleable terpene wise so i use it
a lot and because of what it does and it always passes on if if the the donor if i put it against
anything that has a recessive cbg gene on it it immediately turns it on and i'll get a greater
than two percent on the testing or four four point four five percent cbg even after it's uh
dried cured tested done it's not cbga it's regular cbg and when you smoke something the medicinal
value with that cbg is so calming it's just uh it's it's you know it when you get it and then
and then when you smoke some of it you're just like in chill land you know and it's it's wonderful
so some of them play good with others other ones don't you just got to know which ones do
but uh they they're pretty consistent in how bad they play with each other if if it's stable but
but if it's not stable like we bought eight thousand dollars worth of genetics and ran
all these packs of seeds out what we call the salad run and we ran all these salad
you know the salad run yeah a big salad guys and see what's happening yeah it was it was a it was a
tester and we wanted to see what everybody we're talking we ran uh oh i don't know six
strains from humble aficionado just a bun our uh a whole whack of seeds and it makes me feel a lot
better about what i do when i see what's going around no no negative comments on anybody but
but wow when i when i see what seed that has been bred properly and what the homework's done and
it's stable and it does what it's supposed to does compared to what stuff just comes out the
door i don't know where where they made it it's probably made over in spain and then they they
ship it around everywhere i don't know where the seeds came from but humble does all their own and
a lot of people do all their own but i i was kind of unimpressed by what by what i saw uh anybody can
get a bad uh have a bad day and make some bad stuff but i usually i don't even give it out
anymore i just roast it like pop it like popcorn and sesame oil yeah get rid of it get rid of it
because see you don't have enough time to get through all of them exactly but what that's an
interesting point that you made there with the oh shit now i fucking lost it my kids are distracting
me through the door it's it's quite painful okay we going back to the dominancy thing all right
have you and and you said specifically something very interesting is you have a point you have
your cherry pie that'll add a sweetness to it but won't necessarily over dominate it now i have
your noble sub cools the dank it's like the golden ticket cut it's been around for a while
like a while while um it's about five six years old came up from washington was down in oregon for
a bit um lovely plant actually you know who you know who it came from is um uh he's we both know
him paul martin oh yeah i know paul yeah so it's it's one of the things that he's been holding on
to a while i don't think he hasn't listed anymore it's been delisted um but like beautiful not great
yielder but crazy frosty plant really terpene lean like very very strong terp flavor like it's
beautiful it's a beautiful plant it's something i really love and i i find it very precious so i've
like i put some things on it to play and see what happens um but anyways i find whatever i put on it
fucking just gets taken over by that terpene profile some are better than others but like in
general it's really strong are there specific terpene profiles that you have noticed um i don't
a dominant or recessive isn't a correct like 100 correct term right it's more dominant or more
recessive right like there's it's more of a swath than anything so is there are there terpene
profiles that you find are inherently you know more dominant or inherently more recessive um
i i there's some that i don't like like when you get into some of the perfumey uh
i've done a lot of cindy 99 uh work and and tore that one apart and and did stuff and different
so some other ones that were more uh they're on the floral it's definitely terpene lean there's no
uh hum humily or what am i thinking uh uh starts with l anyway mircene that's why
linoleum or linalool little all yeah uh yeah you're no the the terpene lean is the one that's
really fruity little also is is very fruity i think it's like the lavender kind of and when
you get into some of those they don't play good with with with other stuff you know they'll make
you can make a a whole bat a whole kilogram of bowl cleaner tasting uh uh uh uh uh uh
tasting uh uh weed so it's it's you got to be careful with some of those those fruity mixes um
i had to play around with wedding cake for years until i got it perfect and so uh it's on the edge
of the the the sweet so you can get too sweet i've i've got plenty that i can hook you up with
that are too dang sweet it smells like flowers do you mind talking about the product because
like i mean the wedding cake seems to be something that we've touched on a few times in
the episode so i was wondering because it sounds like you did a lot of work and a lot of time over
that are you able to like talk about how that exactly went like talk about how you did your
wedding cake from start to finish well i it just drew monsters shifting monsters shifting and then
and then back crossing and more sifting and back crossing and selfing and and i just worked it out
worked it out until i had exactly what i wanted a nice fruity smelling wedding cake bud that's big
it grows like a little asteroid you know little point on the top and a nice big bud it can grow
heavy heavy stems it's got a little purple spot like right in the middle where it grows it's kind
of grows purple uh it's really nice and then if you cross it to other things that are purple it
can grow it can throw the weirdest purple colors that you you've seen you know and so i've crossed
it with a bunch of purple and non-purple and so uh it's just it's just one of those things that
you line breed i i i took the uh old white widow that was the original white widow and crossed it
against stuff and made made some strains with that which was which is stunning you know and that's a
good one too but uh you just gotta keep breeding it back against itself or back against uh a pair
apparent of of itself to make it to to take it in directions that you want like uh i got the wedding
cake cross to the cherry pie which is called a cherry cake that that uh rlp has a bunch of seed
for it's a really stunning plant we can't we we can't grow enough of it it's that good it's good
as good as the original gelato and but i'm going to do some work with it and do some back crossing
with gelato and so to see if it plays nice because gelato doesn't tend to play nice like that and
so i'm going to go different ways with it and anybody can do it at home but don't be disappointed
if you plant it and it comes out crappy just throw it away and do it again because and then once you
get on a on a on a roll you can keep it going in a direction but don't cross a to z to p to m to
keep going like that because you're just making these uh these um tangles right and and granted
you could plant a bunch of these tangles but it looks like you planted 50 different seeds and so
you might find one good one out of it and that'll be good for you you just keep it as as clones but
that doesn't work for me because i'm going to stuff to where i can sell seed to a guy who's
going to vacuum seed it into a huge field by tractor a couple rows at a time and in the fall
or in the spring and have it all come up all grow all the way to harvest in the machine harvest
that's where i'm going with with my my research is i i just have one that i tested i planted it
outside june the first week in june here and it went all the way to to finish i had it tested
just the other day and it was testing in the right around 20 uh with greater than two percent uh cbd
and and that you know that's where the future is going to go i don't know what what the lp there
will always be room for craft cannabis like really stunning fantastic flower but i think that that i
can grow stuff they can sell a wholesale for 20 to 30 cents a gram for the flower and it can be
milled and and sold into pre-rolls uh just like cigarettes you buy a pack of cigarettes you can
buy a pack of 20 pre-rolls already rolled up they all have the same flavor and it's unique and
and it has your medicinal uh backbone to it so that's going to be the future
and i'm like people i'm sorry but if you look at any legal market and how it develops
milled and pre-roll are fucking huge and going to be massive massive categories i mean when it
comes to a legal market i mean probably pre-rolled will be the the the the largest category period
um i think in the future period i i think people are just going to buy but really get the message
and the like because a lot of the problem is like i get a pre-roll right now and it
it drives me fucking nuts because i'll get a p roll and i'll get halfway through and you know
like i'm gonna do stuff and have a doobie in my mouth type of guy and like and i'll get halfway
through and the end and the weed will just shoot out of it it's like what the fuck your weed isn't
sticky enough to stay in the paper like what is going on here why do i always lose my pre-roll
well you got to inhale and not exhale well yeah but you know i we doesn't shoot out the end of
my doobies like i don't know the pre-roll process is is not not rocket science but but also people
are doing it badly they got rattled boxes and stuff in lps and a whole staff of people that
are like two guys on the end of the chain are just twisting the ends of the of the pre-roll or
something like that it's like i i think big business will come into the cannabis industry
and and to a certain extent devastate it you know as far as price wise eventually it's the markets
getting over supplied now uh some people don't want to admit it and say oh well there is a big
you can sell a lot of weed right now we we can't get enough of what we have there to sell but also
overall when the u.s opens up you know which could be it could be like a surprise opening
or who knows what there there's going to be so much cannabis go that that uh that the person
who's can grow the best for the lowest is going to rise to the top and the the small craft guys
will just keep growing their tobacco at home well yeah i i think there's there's going to be there's
going to be like two spaces and i i agree but the thing is if you look at any other plant any other
yield per square foot plant in any industry in any space there's nothing that fetches the
the old prices of cannabis even the now prices of cannabis right when it comes down to it you're not
looking you're looking at you know a 13 to 24 cent per square foot if done outdoor you know if you're
doing indoor you know like the prices are just so low for met large production uh per gram that it
shouldn't be incredibly expensive like you should be able to get a 20 pack of of you know pre-rolls
for for pretty cheap you know you should be able to get these things for for a reasonable price but
i think that we've always we've had because it's been illegal and it's been a commodity issue
it's always been high high price and high value product and and when you look at food or any other
relatable consumption category product there's nothing that fetches the same price in in in
any sort of cost per square foot yield right yeah government government will will be always
wanting their cut out of everything you know that's what they do with beer and wine that's
what they do with cigarettes they're gonna want and right now the excise tax i think is based upon
ten dollars a gram so so uh if you if you're gonna ship something out to to a store you're paying
excise tax to the government as if it's ten dollars a gram but you're only selling it for
for you know less than three dollars maybe two yeah you're not you're you're not selling it for
for ten bucks a gram no and and like we have 85 ounces on the over the counter now like pure
sun farm has their 85 ounce program that they've dropped all around so there's like you can buy
cheap okay weed here in canada now and it's like so but i i also see craft farmers you know like
like rosebud farms like uh like i mean you're working with with with perkland and and they're
having stock issues but with withered coasts as well with their coast cannabis um some of these
craft farmers and they just can't hold on to product long enough they just can't it seems
like they're just running out all the time they're trying to put out as much as they can but they
can't quite satisfy the market so i wonder if there's going to be like almost like the the the
cigar cigarette two separate communities of tobacco i think i think cannabis will do something
pretty similarly um eventually further on down the line maybe two or three categories maybe like you
got your extract category you have your your your your cigar craft level category and then your
your cheap ass mass production they have that in cigarettes you know you can buy your your chewing
tobacco or your snuff or your cigarettes or your pipe tobacco or your cigars you know and so they
get this this uh buzz around cigars right so you got a humidor you got a special smoking room it's
got the right terpenes and stuff so there'll be a market for for everything but the mass
mass bulk of everyone is just going to buy a pack of marbles right and so big business is going to
slide into that into that spot and devastate it but the the good news is the home growers like you
and other people they're going to grow their medicine at home and and uh and learn how to do
it and and as a geneticist if i can make better seed that you could i can sell you seed and you
can put it in the ground i've got plants that i planted in the fall that were i planted the seed
in the fall it came up by itself in the spring and grew to full maturity here without being touched
so that that's something you know so if you could go out in the fall and harvest your last plant and
just scratch just throw some seeds out on the ground and then come back the next year and get it
it doesn't rot it doesn't mold it's it's easy to grow you don't need to trim it you just grow it
you know that's that's going to be the the home growers are going to like that but right now
so many of the the legacy strains are so dang finicky because the people have been just growing
them indoors for forever and they they they'll grow it up it'll be nice they'll smell the turps
everything oh let's squeeze the buds and it's already there and then boom the mold hits and
you got bud rot oh it looks so good september 1st dead yeah and so i'm fixing that stuff you know
that's and at four plants if you do it right and and and and make sure like take care of it you can
grow enough herb for yourself for the entire year yeah yeah we should do a video one time where we
take people through it step by step by step for mr green nobody knows nothing how they can take a
shovel and amend their soil and everything and plant it in the fall and come back oh yeah it's
up in the spring nope it frosted but it didn't freeze off it's still there and it recuperates
and they got this eight foot uh monster in the backyard that finishes on time that people gonna
be happy about that exactly yeah it finishes on time and and actually doesn't mold out or have
challenges yeah which has been interesting but why don't we we are kind of running tighter on time
because i do have to be out to drive the wife and do the work stuff yeah i don't think jay's
gonna make it back from from the show oh it's all good i think we had a pretty good time and some
great conversation regardless but why don't we chat a little bit about because we do have some
exciting couple episodes coming up yeah and then i believe so next week i have sativa creations
joining us and he is an italian breeder now he's been on a couple of my shows before
but he's a brilliant breeder based out of italy and he actually does um he's taking the he's taking
the certified hemp cultivars that were available in italy that you could buy the point under point
three that were from the government that were certified allowed and he planted a freaking
ridiculous amount of them and hunted through and found phenos and and has your mic running down
your mic just quit oh now i hear you uh he he's been doing it for a few years so he he actually
supplies a lot of the hemp genetics for smokable hemp cultivars in italy um to the farmers and he's
done a lot of them so that'll be a really fun episode because he's actually just taking something
that was just pretty much crap registered certified hemp cultivars found phenos throughout
that thing and then bred them into their own lines which is pretty cool and do they test above point
three three uh they don't they depending some he'll he'll talk more about i don't want to speak
for him but he says you know if you're in the south and it's very very hot and you have a very
very dry season at at this point you know you might need to harvest a little bit earlier or
you might get so he's got it pretty down i think he's you know he's like two three years in so he's
not like eight you know f 16 x 20 like yourself but he's getting there and he's had to work from
the base point of what he was given when when the legalization kind of changed in italy and it was
confirmed that he could breed the hemp cultivars freely so he had to like really you know this
these are the ones that i'm allowed to work with so this is what i'm going to work with
so he hasn't had a lot as much time to like build into his library but he's doing some really
fantastic stuff he produces seed for huku as well as other people and really has great stuff so we'll
have him on and then the following week we have dr philip henry um joining us for an episode which
will be really good new school breeding he's on new school crisper cast nine all those all those
new school ways of breeding he'll he's he's got the inside uh on that for sure
simon simon from serious seeds was supposed to be on today but he had some first some stuff that
they get that kicked him in and off and he couldn't come on the show today uh so but we
might get him back for monday you think or next week we're we're planning for him to be back a
little bit later this week we're gonna i'm hoping monday i haven't heard a confirmation from him
for monday but you know i'm thinking like you're pretty good wednesday thursday not tuesday yeah
any day any day except for tuesday i i got in here and same for him so it's perfect so we'll
just go any day he's got an interesting take people are gonna like he's got like 13 varieties
that he does and that's it so he's he's like really he knows his stuff about stability and
how to keep it small it's not like he's one of these guys that have every 10 days a new new
strain coming out you know he's got stuff that's tested it's it's true and it's great and it's it's
tested for europe so the those europeans they they love his seeds yes they do so we'll have him on as
soon as we can i'm not going to give anybody a solid date and time until i have it locked in
and we have him on the camera sometimes the bigger guy bigger name guys get a little bit more
challenging over time but i mean that was a great episode i think you should try and link up jay
with peter and see if he wants to bring him on today i don't know if he has any on daggett i
don't think he does i didn't i didn't see next generation seeds on there uh yeah we'll do i'll
talk to him probably tonight so and then and then so we have a few other things and then of course
we have the end of end of the season end of season one finale which will be the brady bunch episode
on december 3rd right yeah a big cluster visit with everybody can all come in at once and that
that'll be fun actually i'm looking forward to hearing everybody talk back and around whatever
whatever we kick around it's going to be great it'll be a good time that's for sure so that'll
happen on december 3rd we have what day is it today saturday we don't have any evening shows
that i can think of or i'm aware of let me just check the the calendar and see because we do have
this afternoon mark smith from sensi seeds looks like he's going to be here oh no that's not this
week i'm teasing you guys apparently mark smith from sensi seeds is here next week it's in the
calendar but we don't know we don't have a confirmation there so we don't have anything
else happening today on the calendar i believe the guerrero grow show is going on on any of the
other channels um but regardless okay that jorge savant is if you're listening please call uh london
we want to we want to talk we will bring him on which would be funny uh and then we have atlas is
coming atlas coming we have but later this week we've got cannabis for breakfast on tuesday um and
that's going to be should be with sweet grass and then the dank hour that evening we're gonna have a
uh probably pomponics drop in uh for a show yes my hair is getting huge i hope mark will be able to
yeah we'll see like i didn't i didn't say that it was for sure anything it happens um but yeah so it
should be a fun week um lots of content going on be back next week for another episode of the
sift right you got anything left to say before we go a little uh extra a little ink
