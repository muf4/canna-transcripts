[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  And how do you pronounce your name?
[00:02.000 --> 00:04.000]  Kwa Te Mok.
[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  Okay, can I call you Kwa?
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  Everybody calls me Mr. V.
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  Mr. V, alright.
[00:10.000 --> 00:15.000]  And I believe we are live, so welcome everyone.
[00:15.000 --> 00:19.000]  Let me know if you can see me in the chat.
[00:24.460 --> 00:29.460]  Can you see us in the chat, chat, chat?
[00:30.460 --> 00:32.460]  Yo, Phil.
[00:32.460 --> 00:34.460]  Icons.
[00:34.460 --> 00:37.460]  Yes, okay, I see a thumbs up.
[00:37.460 --> 00:40.460]  I'll assume that that means you can see us in the chat.
[00:40.460 --> 00:47.460]  So, today we're talking to Olfactory Genetics at 3 o'clock Pacific time,
[00:47.460 --> 00:52.460]  but we have the bonus, the warm-up act.
[00:52.460 --> 00:56.460]  We're going to talk Biochar and Living Soil with Mr. V.
[00:56.460 --> 00:57.460]  So, welcome.
[00:57.460 --> 01:04.460]  So, you gave a presentation, and let me just show everybody your Instagram
[01:04.460 --> 01:06.460]  so they can follow along.
[01:06.460 --> 01:07.460]  Give me one second.
[01:07.460 --> 01:13.460]  But you gave a presentation, the Scaling Biochar Forum,
[01:13.460 --> 01:15.460]  which was on October 13th and 14th.
[01:15.460 --> 01:19.460]  So, can you kind of talk about some of the stuff from your –
[01:19.460 --> 01:21.460]  did you give a presentation there?
[01:21.460 --> 01:23.460]  Yeah, I did.
[01:23.460 --> 01:24.460]  I kind of went over –
[01:24.460 --> 01:26.460]  Do you want to give me a clip notes version?
[01:26.460 --> 01:27.460]  I will, I will.
[01:27.460 --> 01:33.460]  So, my work with the biochars is a little bit different than the other presenters.
[01:33.460 --> 01:36.460]  I do a lot of actual application out in the field,
[01:36.460 --> 01:40.460]  so I can push the envelope and the edges a little bit more outside of the boxes
[01:40.460 --> 01:44.460]  and outside the rules because I'm actually out there in the field and can do that.
[01:44.460 --> 01:49.460]  So, my presentation was about biochar and about using biochar raw
[01:49.460 --> 01:52.460]  and using biochar charged.
[01:53.460 --> 01:57.460]  And also, we had rows that were planted with identical plants,
[01:57.460 --> 01:58.460]  but two different styles.
[01:58.460 --> 02:02.460]  On one half of the field, we were able to char that till into the rows
[02:02.460 --> 02:04.460]  and fill the rows completely with biochar.
[02:04.460 --> 02:08.460]  And on the other half of the field, we only could afford to put biochar
[02:08.460 --> 02:10.460]  in at planting in the holes.
[02:10.460 --> 02:16.460]  So, that was very interesting because the plants, as they grew, they looked identical.
[02:16.460 --> 02:21.460]  The sizes were enormous and beautiful, and we couldn't tell what the difference was.
[02:21.460 --> 02:26.460]  So, going into flower, it looked like the results were going to be the same,
[02:26.460 --> 02:29.460]  whether I put the char all the way through the row or if I put it in the hole.
[02:29.460 --> 02:32.460]  But the real results came at the end of the season when we sent it to lab.
[02:32.460 --> 02:35.460]  I was working for a company that they mainly make concentrates.
[02:35.460 --> 02:37.460]  That's all they do is concentrate oil.
[02:37.460 --> 02:42.460]  So, they had a lot of data prior to using regenerative farming and biochar,
[02:42.460 --> 02:43.460]  growing the same strains.
[02:43.460 --> 02:48.460]  And then, now we started to collect the data from the biochar-grown crops.
[02:48.460 --> 02:52.460]  So, that's why I was presenting at that particular conference and sharing the information.
[02:52.460 --> 02:58.460]  And what we did find out was that biochar first season in the rows where the char was
[02:58.460 --> 03:03.460]  put in completely into the row, you saw a double amount of terpenes being developed
[03:03.460 --> 03:05.460]  in the final product of the oil.
[03:05.460 --> 03:08.460]  Sometimes, we even got close to three times the amount of oil.
[03:08.460 --> 03:11.460]  And this was a direct contribution to the carbon ring.
[03:12.460 --> 03:18.460]  The electrical contribution from biochar is what holds the terpene together.
[03:18.460 --> 03:20.460]  The center point of that is a carbon ring.
[03:20.460 --> 03:25.460]  So, how strong that carbon ring is determines whether it's going to gas off or stay on the finished product.
[03:25.460 --> 03:31.460]  So, we were able to not only we went from 4% capture of oil to biomass,
[03:31.460 --> 03:37.460]  and we got that thing up to 7% with doubling the terpenes, some almost tripling.
[03:37.460 --> 03:42.460]  So, these are the kind of things where, you know, it used to make sense for the cultivator
[03:42.460 --> 03:45.460]  and the connoisseur to use char because we have a terpene-rich product.
[03:45.460 --> 03:50.460]  But to get the spreadsheet people on board, they have to know a different set of numbers.
[03:50.460 --> 03:54.460]  So, being able to put that information together, show them you're going to capture more oil,
[03:54.460 --> 03:59.460]  you're going to have more terpene-rich oil, and then that moves you into a different market for retail.
[03:59.460 --> 04:02.460]  Now, they won't build a field without biochar.
[04:02.460 --> 04:04.460]  That's the expenditure that they automatically think about now.
[04:04.460 --> 04:08.460]  But that project that we did last year, the expense is so high for biochar.
[04:08.460 --> 04:12.460]  That's why a lot of you guys ain't using it because it's not in the budget.
[04:12.460 --> 04:16.460]  And to try to get your managers to say, I'm going to use up half my budget for biochar,
[04:16.460 --> 04:20.460]  they ask questions you can't answer, you know, you may not have the knowledge.
[04:20.460 --> 04:25.460]  But I was fortunate enough, Springwater Organics and Bob Sand Farms both believed in biochar enough
[04:25.460 --> 04:29.460]  to let me run that field at the percentage I thought would be good at.
[04:29.460 --> 04:31.460]  And that was a 15% ratio at that field.
[04:32.460 --> 04:33.460]  15% ratio.
[04:33.460 --> 04:40.460]  And on the half of the field where I tilled the char in, I charged that stuff up with Bokashi and EM
[04:40.460 --> 04:43.460]  and gave it a chance to really get going.
[04:43.460 --> 04:47.460]  But it was raw when I got going, and all my colleagues were saying, you can't use raw char.
[04:47.460 --> 04:52.460]  But because I have been using EM, effective microbes, for so long, and I know how good that that brew is,
[04:52.460 --> 04:58.460]  I was confident enough that they were going to inoculate the char and increase the indigenous microbes
[04:58.460 --> 05:02.460]  already in the area that it was a win-win.
[05:02.460 --> 05:03.460]  So we did it.
[05:03.460 --> 05:10.460]  We did that on both sides using the EM Bokashi on raw char, and it just had good results.
[05:11.460 --> 05:17.460]  So with the, all right, when we're talking raw, you're saying with the raw,
[05:17.460 --> 05:21.460]  you also put in the Bokashi with the EM one and all that stuff.
[05:21.460 --> 05:25.460]  And then the charged was, what would the charged be?
[05:25.460 --> 05:26.460]  The charge.
[05:26.460 --> 05:28.460]  So the charge is going to be the EM Bokashi.
[05:28.460 --> 05:30.460]  The biochar I got was raw.
[05:30.460 --> 05:31.460]  There was nothing on it.
[05:31.460 --> 05:33.460]  It was completely fresh from the manufacturer.
[05:33.460 --> 05:40.460]  So when I hit it with the EM, the EM is usually becomes a food source for all the other microbes around there.
[05:40.460 --> 05:44.460]  It doesn't like come in to take over, and you can hardly even find them when you scope the EM,
[05:44.460 --> 05:45.460]  after you put them into the soil.
[05:45.460 --> 05:50.460]  But they really become the catalyst for the microbes that want to do the work.
[05:50.460 --> 05:56.460]  So I basically put in a buffet on that char, so then the other guys can just move in and get going right away.
[05:56.460 --> 06:03.460]  So that's why I was able to have success so fast, because the EM was feeding the native microbes.
[06:03.460 --> 06:11.460]  As to oppose when people use regular char, the consortium that they put in may not accelerate the microbial growth fast enough to justify,
[06:11.460 --> 06:14.460]  you know, the plant begins to show deficiencies.
[06:14.460 --> 06:17.460]  And then this is why people scratch the Bokashi.
[06:17.460 --> 06:20.460]  But partnering it with the EM or scratch the biochar.
[06:20.460 --> 06:26.460]  But when you partner it with the right microbial consortia, then you have things happen a lot faster.
[06:26.460 --> 06:31.460]  So with, and this was straight into a field.
[06:31.460 --> 06:35.460]  So these were these were plants that went straight into the ground.
[06:35.460 --> 06:40.460]  Yeah, correct. It's a tier two OLCC producer farm in Oregon here.
[06:40.460 --> 06:48.460]  So big field, you know, we have 400 foot rows, you know, eight of them in one section.
[06:48.460 --> 06:55.460]  And then I think there's four 200 foot rows in another. So they are real size fields.
[06:55.460 --> 07:00.460]  And typically, so so is this something you've done before?
[07:00.460 --> 07:08.460]  Like is or is this kind of the first time you've done this and you're seeing the results so that you can show people the data?
[07:08.460 --> 07:13.460]  Yeah, that's a great question. You know, I come from California, became medical in 97.
[07:13.460 --> 07:17.460]  Was fortunate enough to be in the Emerald Triangle with a heart of regenerative farming is.
[07:17.460 --> 07:23.460]  And we've done this all the time. The reason why you haven't heard it is because whatever goes to market,
[07:23.460 --> 07:26.460]  nobody cares how you're growing something. They're just looking for the bottom line price.
[07:26.460 --> 07:33.460]  But now with all the terpene tests and all the tests that are required to show the power of regenerative farming.
[07:33.460 --> 07:36.460]  Now people are looking at a different. But we've done this all the time.
[07:36.460 --> 07:40.460]  Of course, not in field size like this. You know, there was legalities that limited us that.
[07:40.460 --> 07:46.460]  But we always see success in our own medical productions and in our friends fields.
[07:46.460 --> 07:54.460]  We would just see that this was the was making the fire and people who even had the herb wanted our herb because it was so rich in terpene.
[07:54.460 --> 07:58.460]  I love it. Look at this here. That's our thinking cap for today. I love it.
[07:58.460 --> 08:04.460]  So, yeah, that's what it was. We always done it. So then when we become to get jobs in the legal industry,
[08:04.460 --> 08:07.460]  you know, we're working with bottom line people and they don't even use cannabis.
[08:07.460 --> 08:11.460]  So they don't know what the difference between a terpene rich flower and a non terpene rich flower.
[08:11.460 --> 08:15.460]  They only know the spreadsheet talk. So this is where we when we're moving into a different sector,
[08:15.460 --> 08:21.460]  when you're able to partner with management that believes in, OK, I kind of see what this job is talking about.
[08:21.460 --> 08:27.460]  That's where why it's such a miracle, because we're able to not only shift the regenerative thinking in the field,
[08:27.460 --> 08:34.460]  but the regenerative thinking in the office and the management where that eludes them a lot of times.
[08:34.460 --> 08:42.460]  So can we talk? I mean, because for me, it's like, you know, you mentioned sourcing biochar from the manufacturer,
[08:42.460 --> 08:55.460]  which implies that someone's like to me, it's kind of like there's biochar that maybe you use the wood on your own property and you know how to do it and make it versus sourcing it and having it sent.
[08:56.460 --> 09:04.460]  Kind of, I guess my question is like the sustainability of biochar that that's sourced from like a manufacturer.
[09:04.460 --> 09:09.460]  Good question. My whole background in biochar is with a nonprofit called Sonoma Biochar Initiative.
[09:09.460 --> 09:17.460]  That's what we do. We teach people how to convert biomass on their field so that you don't have to buy the stuff in the cannabis industry.
[09:17.460 --> 09:21.460]  You know, they don't have the time and the resource, but they have the resources,
[09:21.460 --> 09:26.460]  but they don't have the time to then go through the steps you'll see on the biocharinitiative.org website.
[09:26.460 --> 09:29.460]  But that's that's what we do and been doing, not just with cannabis.
[09:29.460 --> 09:35.460]  We have lots and lots of vineyards around Napa Sonoma area that they just rip out fields, throw away.
[09:35.460 --> 09:39.460]  It costs about 20,000 to dump them. You know, it depends how many blocks are thrown away.
[09:39.460 --> 09:45.460]  But when they can when we can train the management to then burn that in a way that doesn't pollute the air,
[09:45.460 --> 09:51.460]  we call that a conservation burn or a top lit burn where a lot of those particles go right into the flame front.
[09:51.460 --> 09:56.460]  And you end up with about 98 percent less particles going up into the air.
[09:56.460 --> 10:00.460]  They're able to then with the cost of their team doing it about three thousand dollars.
[10:00.460 --> 10:03.460]  Plus, they have a byproduct of biochar. So that's the whole goal.
[10:03.460 --> 10:06.460]  We want people to then trap their biomass.
[10:06.460 --> 10:12.460]  And now the science is looking at all the different electrical components within the different carbons being processed.
[10:12.460 --> 10:18.460]  And hemp and cannabis is about 200 percent more conductive than anything else they're finding.
[10:18.460 --> 10:25.460]  So the fact that we're like throwing away this super high quality conductive material, it's like part of that missing link in our business.
[10:25.460 --> 10:30.460]  And then when you think about the forest and how that grows itself based on the old fire,
[10:30.460 --> 10:38.460]  anybody doing a seed program and not using old stocks from those plants that have the information going on to the next seed.
[10:38.460 --> 10:45.460]  This is all part of what nature does. The new growth of the forest is always healthier because it has the burn from the old tree.
[10:45.460 --> 10:51.460]  So when we put our old tree back into the soil, those new seeds that come around, a different kind of fire comes out of them.
[10:51.460 --> 10:56.460]  And that's what makes your next guest so important because he had all his seeds seem to have that fire.
[10:56.460 --> 11:00.460]  You know, certain cultivators seem to capture that in their seed.
[11:00.460 --> 11:05.460]  That's where it comes from. It's mimicking the patterns of nature, putting those into the soil.
[11:05.460 --> 11:09.460]  And then you're able to recreate those dynamics within your cultivation site.
[11:09.460 --> 11:13.460]  I mean, it's interesting. I know you just go ahead, Josh.
[11:13.460 --> 11:29.460]  Well, I was going to ask, maybe you guys already talked about this before I got on, but I've heard this rule of like if you're constructing a soil or if you're applying a biochar that you don't want more than 15, even maybe as far as 20 percent in the overall mix.
[11:30.460 --> 11:38.460]  And so I was just curious and I've took that as I've been making custom soils from a new. But how do you approach that on a cyclical year after year basis?
[11:38.460 --> 11:49.460]  Excellent question. But when we look at the originating place of where the biochar comes from in the Amazon, it's terra preta is what the research is.
[11:49.460 --> 11:58.460]  It's called Black Earth. When you look at the composites Cornell took of the Black Earth, where all this research began back in the 60s, you know, we're finding that soil is 40, 45 percent carbon.
[11:59.460 --> 12:05.460]  Because they would always use the continual village fires on all the village burn. So it would accumulate over time.
[12:05.460 --> 12:14.460]  So when we are doing data output for projects that are so new going out there, the numbers are going to be way different.
[12:14.460 --> 12:19.460]  And if you look at the year things are published, they change over time because of the quality of char control that we have.
[12:19.460 --> 12:22.460]  So you just think of the biochar as like early years of compost.
[12:23.460 --> 12:29.460]  They just used to call it compost. But now we have specific designer compost. And we know more about compost.
[12:29.460 --> 12:33.460]  You know, like it's not all the same shit. It's different stuff happening.
[12:33.460 --> 12:42.460]  So when you when you research the biochar, because it's so new to science side, you know, take all that information knowing it's going to change.
[12:42.460 --> 12:46.460]  But when you look at the indigenous knowledge of biochar, that doesn't change.
[12:46.460 --> 12:53.460]  And that's always been the same. And our soils are very high above anything being recommended by any of the major agencies today.
[12:53.460 --> 12:54.460]  So a little bit different.
[12:54.460 --> 13:09.460]  Well, it kind of makes sense. Like if I think about hugelkultur tech and like when you build a hugelkultur, that wood, that carbon is sucking up the available nutrients until it reaches saturation and everything starts to break down and it flips and goes the other way.
[13:10.460 --> 13:19.460]  And so, you know, maybe that's part of the process as long as you're keeping it within check and you're not overloading too much that, you know, because as I was asking the question, I'm thinking the same thing.
[13:19.460 --> 13:22.460]  Historically, that's how we've done burn and rotate, you know?
[13:22.460 --> 13:28.460]  Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. And because if you put so much char, it's just trying to grab everything to suck all that juice out of everything.
[13:28.460 --> 13:33.460]  So I can see where the limitations are. Don't try to get indigenous soil quality your first run.
[13:33.460 --> 13:45.460]  You want to build up to that. You want that to be years and years of successions before it gets that high. But you start low and build your way up. It's nonstop. You'll see your plants live. Everything works well.
[13:45.460 --> 13:51.460]  So what I was going to say before is I remember, you know, every time I like, isn't it like almond trees?
[13:51.460 --> 13:58.460]  They basically have to rip them out every X number of years. And then like I'd always drive by those orchards and they just have these big burns.
[13:58.460 --> 14:13.460]  And I was like, that's so devastating. And I talked to a guy a long time ago about the idea of, you know, the for energy, you know, if you could get I mean, we're talking biochar here.
[14:13.460 --> 14:20.460]  But that conversation was about using it in the same way you'd have like a natural gas powered generator.
[14:21.460 --> 14:32.460]  But instead of using something like natural gas, you'd use all this wood from these orchards. But that that seems like something where like they're just burning it currently. And if you could just teach them how to make biochar.
[14:32.460 --> 14:46.460]  I mean, they could put it all over their almond orchards too, right? Like you can just burning it where it just, you know, you lose it. But somebody asked. So I don't want or are you are you parked?
[14:47.460 --> 14:48.460]  Oh, yeah.
[14:48.460 --> 15:08.460]  I didn't want to show something to be like read this and then have you crash. But no, you're good. So so key salmon asked, what do you do to activate them? So you get raw biochar. That's just the carbon structure. It's the housing. What's your kind of sequential next steps to activate it?
[15:09.460 --> 15:22.460]  I always try to apply this information based on your standard, whatever you're growing method you're using. If you've got a compost pile going, mix the char with your compost going into the compost pile. That seems to work very well. Probably the easiest way.
[15:23.460 --> 15:33.460]  This is a cannabis production site, wine production site. You're going to have a raw char that you're either going to mix a 50 50 to compost and then drop on top in the field.
[15:34.460 --> 15:53.460]  We can do the mixes 10 to 15 percent in with your soil and then drop those into your soil, into your beds or your bags, whatever you're growing, growing with. One of my favorite ways is to get a we load up the 275 tote with water and then I load that sock up full of Bokashi and some other good ingredients in there.
[15:53.460 --> 16:06.460]  Some one shot and then let that squeeze out for just probably about five, 10 minutes and running our aerator. And then that should get nice and foamy. Then I can pump that right onto the fresh char being planted.
[16:07.460 --> 16:20.460]  So if I mix my soil, like I told you, half that bad, I was only able to dig out holes and then mix the char and put all that stuff back into the hole. I didn't plant right away into it. I waited about five days, but I hit it two times with that Bokashi water. I just explained.
[16:20.460 --> 16:32.460]  So using your compost teas on that biochar really gets it going really quick to adding the molasses to your compost tea gives your your your your your microbes a food source.
[16:33.460 --> 16:48.460]  So once they get onto that char, they have their sugars. They can really get rolling too. So, you know, thinking about what stage you're in, there's so many ways to charge it. But I like the Bokashi. I like the compost tea and I like compost. All those together seem to do really well.
[16:49.460 --> 17:06.740]  And then people are talking. So, by the way, everyone in the chat, I my microphone's either way too loud or way too soft. So am I OK right now? Or am I either blowing you guys out of the water or can you barely hear me?
[17:06.740 --> 17:26.740]  I'm OK. All right. Well, anyway, people were talking about kind of like if you want to move in a fungally dominant direction or a bacterial dominant. Do you have kind of preferences in terms of when you're starting or when you're charging it?
[17:26.740 --> 17:48.740]  No, I try to run a 50 50. I like to use the liquid EM, which has both consortia fungal and bacterial. And this is because each plant, depending on where they're located in that land race chart, they're going to partner with, you know, some prefer more of the grassier bacterial soils. Some prefer more of the fungal dominant soils.
[17:48.740 --> 18:07.740]  Since we've hybrid so many things, I try not to predict what that relationship is. The EM allows the plant to pick and partner with the ones that it needs to survive and nurture in that environment. So I like to just make sure I have the liquid EM right at the roots, especially during like from clone stage right off the bat.
[18:07.740 --> 18:26.740]  Then they can begin to foster the relationship from the microbe that's going to benefit them most. So I wouldn't I wouldn't go either or find a consortium that supports both that because the plants we grow require both some more than others in their selections.
[18:27.740 --> 18:53.740]  If you do find something fungal, run the wood chip, the wood chip. And then it goes wood chip, anything leafy. You know, we can buy the wood chip from any feed store now. Real nice cedar and it works good for like gnats and stuff too. And spider mites, the cedar is great for that. So anything and anything mulch is going to boost your fungal. And then sugary run the molasses when you're watering. That'll get your bacterials real nice.
[18:54.740 --> 19:03.740]  Josh, have you been playing with biochar at all?
[19:04.740 --> 19:27.740]  I have definitely used biochar in a lot of my mixes. If I'm going to make like I was saying earlier, if I'm making a mix from scratch, it's definitely 15% biochar is in the mix. And I put that in like as an addition. So I make my whole soil mix. It's a third aeration, a third compost, a third whatever it's going to be. I've used peat in the past. I'm struggling with that and still don't have a good answer.
[19:28.740 --> 19:34.740]  I know there's alternatives, but I'm not really satisfied on what I'm seeing yet. But then I add the additional 15%.
[19:34.740 --> 19:35.740]  So it would be a...
[19:35.740 --> 19:37.740]  Let me get one of those alternatives. Keep talking.
[19:39.740 --> 19:42.740]  Don't throw me with any pit moss shit either.
[19:42.740 --> 20:01.740]  I have and I've charged it with compost pea and let it sit for a year before I put it into a compost mix. I've kind of done that stuff. But there's a company up here where I'm from that I'm really impressed with the research there, Black Owl Biochar. I don't know if you know of them.
[20:01.740 --> 20:03.740]  Yeah, 100%. Yep. Yep.
[20:04.740 --> 20:13.740]  Yeah, she's a good lady. We spent some time on the phone and she kind of verified that I was going down the right track. And so I kind of just didn't go deeper down the rabbit hole, to be honest.
[20:14.740 --> 20:24.740]  Yeah, it's, you know, even using like say you got your bag set and you haven't used biochar, you can go grab that activated carbon. You know, they're selling that at the grocery outlet nowadays.
[20:24.740 --> 20:35.740]  And because it's so micronized, you drop that into your teas. It goes right into the soil and dirt. But that's where you begin. Like people who are kind of on the fence with biochar, I'll have them run that activated carbon.
[20:36.740 --> 20:47.740]  So the plants just get jonesed off that, that the next run of the char, they always are hitting me up for the char ratios. Because you can just, you can play with that. And it's so light, it's micronized.
[20:47.740 --> 20:49.740]  Are you putting out a product yourself?
[20:49.740 --> 20:51.740]  Say again?
[20:51.740 --> 20:54.740]  Are you putting a product out yourself at this point?
[20:54.740 --> 20:59.740]  No, no, I just do education. I don't sell no products.
[20:59.740 --> 21:01.740]  Okay, I was just curious.
[21:02.740 --> 21:12.740]  So what one of the things this company Pitmoss, which is basically recycled. Do you know him, Josh?
[21:12.740 --> 21:16.740]  I just said something stupid. I was just knocking on it and then you brought it up.
[21:18.740 --> 21:22.740]  Well, now I want to try it. Tell me your thoughts.
[21:22.740 --> 21:41.740]  I don't want to knock it. I already stuck my foot in my mouth. So I just am not so sold on the idea of using recycled cardboard in my soil and for my body. Like that's just that. I don't want that shit. That's my base thought on it. But I could be, they could have something they do. They remediate stuff. I have no idea. I'm speaking out my ass.
[21:42.740 --> 22:10.740]  Well, that's why I want to bring their lead scientist on to kind of understand what their process is. Like, are they literally just taking all the like, you know, newspaper and cardboard recycling? Like, anyway, I'd love to learn about it. But yeah, you know, I know the other one is Delano, you know, and the palm fronds, which are, you know, super sustainable because they I mean, not where you guys live, but down here they they grow.
[22:10.740 --> 22:24.740]  I mean, I can see them right outside my house. And like when the winds blow, you have the fronds all over the streets and stuff. So but anyway, it's interesting to think about like alternatives to cocoa and.
[22:25.740 --> 22:50.740]  Well, and to be honest, any more from my perspective, like I used to make these potting soil mixes. And that's the key term potting soil, potting, potting. It's for pots to move around to be light. When I got taught to make soil for growing cannabis originally was not for pots to be moved around. And we use sand, a third sand and we oil that sort of stuff.
[22:51.740 --> 23:17.740]  And so now that's really what I'm doing. I'm building up my native soil, I grow in beds. And even if I'm indoors, I bring that soil, native soil indoors. And I go from there rather than trying to start with this, this base, you know, even if PEMAS was sustainable, I still have to buy it. And I still have to work with it to get it to a usable state. And I'm just kind of done with with pots, you know, I said, in general, I still need to use them for transplanting and in my process.
[23:18.740 --> 23:22.740]  So I'm not totally out of it, but I'm shifting that way.
[23:24.740 --> 23:39.740]  So we have olfactory genetics coming on any minute. So do you want to talk about I mean, you know, you do you want to actually I have I have Leo calling in right now.
[23:40.740 --> 23:41.740]  Yeah. Give me a second.
[23:51.060 --> 23:55.060]  Josh, I'm going to kill your video while you do this just so we have great audio.
[24:00.800 --> 24:03.800]  Can you hear me? You're muted.
[24:07.800 --> 24:08.800]  Can you hear me? Yeah.
[24:10.800 --> 24:13.800]  Hey, Leo, what's going on? I'm live with Peter on the future cannabis.
[24:33.240 --> 24:36.240]  Can you guys hear him? Yeah. Okay.
[24:39.240 --> 24:41.240]  Go ahead, Leo. We can we can we can hear you. Well.
[24:42.240 --> 25:03.040]  They moved us out of the quarantine and put us all together over a year. So that really helps us now be able to keep it up.
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.000]  Hell yeah, man. We got another big one going up Wednesday night on the Dark Horse feed.
[25:22.000 --> 25:28.000]  We're actually going to do a takeover and take over everyone's feet at the same time and just be a fucking mass.
[25:29.000 --> 26:18.550]  Yeah, man. Well, we're all we're all there with, you know, sending our love and our positive vibes and whatever we can do and doing our end.
[26:19.550 --> 26:25.550]  So it's good to hear your voice and have a little verification out there that there's no bullshit going on, you know.
[26:31.530 --> 27:05.860]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, we're just send you guys lots of love, man.
[27:08.860 --> 27:10.860]  Appreciate you taking the time, you know, to call in.
[27:16.860 --> 27:20.860]  We're actually just that we were talking biochar and we're about to pop on with Avery.
[27:21.860 --> 27:26.860]  I think you might remember him from olfactory genetics. And he's going to tell us about what he what he's up to.
[27:27.860 --> 27:31.860]  He was on there when you you were there raising money for the fire relief. I believe.
[27:32.860 --> 27:38.450]  Yeah. Yeah. So we're just about to start with him.
[27:39.450 --> 27:42.450]  But it was it perfect timing to do the switchover. So thanks again, man.
[27:42.450 --> 28:08.370]  Right. Yeah, man. Well, you paid forward. So it's kind of in some ways we're paying you back type deal.
[28:09.370 --> 28:23.240]  That's how it feels. That's cool.
[28:45.070 --> 28:50.070]  Hell yeah, man. Peter, you have anything?
[28:53.790 --> 28:59.790]  Now, just, you know, we we we're all here. We're all trying to do what we can.
[28:59.790 --> 29:04.790]  I mean, I think it seems like, you know, Josh and a couple other people are the people you can talk to.
[29:05.790 --> 29:14.790]  So just let them know what you need. You know, we talked about like the the real estate lawyer as something that's critical as well.
[29:15.790 --> 29:19.790]  So I think Josh has been working on that. And then I talked to a couple.
[29:20.790 --> 29:27.790]  Do you know who who your lawyer is or do you have a court appointed or did you pick a lawyer?
[29:27.790 --> 29:30.790]  Yeah, we ended up picking a local lawyer.
[29:31.790 --> 30:06.770]  I was going to say, Josh, if you can take down that guy's name and I'll run it by some of the other lawyers to just get a like, you know, two thumbs up.
[30:07.770 --> 30:10.770]  He's awesome. Or, oh, my God, don't go with that guy. Or yeah, I wrote it.
[30:11.770 --> 30:13.770]  Someone said it. Did he just say Robert Paulson?
[30:14.770 --> 30:15.770]  No, Robert Willful.
[30:16.770 --> 30:21.870]  How do you spell Will? How do you spell the last name?
[30:21.870 --> 30:22.870]  A little bit.
[30:30.970 --> 30:31.970]  OK, we'll figure it out.
[30:33.970 --> 31:43.790]  And have you crossed paths with Christian Carter, who's also locked up there?
[31:45.790 --> 32:17.060]  Gotcha.
[32:19.060 --> 32:20.060]  So I didn't know Chris.
[32:25.080 --> 32:26.080]  I think he went back.
[32:27.080 --> 32:28.080]  Oh, he went back?
[32:29.080 --> 32:30.080]  Yeah.
[32:30.080 --> 32:38.370]  Yeah, it's a very good photo.
[32:38.370 --> 32:44.370]  Yeah, we had some of the people from Eldorado County that were, you know, Growers Alliance or whatever.
[32:45.370 --> 32:47.370]  They were talking about the rampage the sheriff's been on.
[33:02.100 --> 33:03.100]  Yeah, it's really, really shitty.
[33:05.100 --> 33:06.100]  We're sorry to you, man.
[33:40.540 --> 33:45.540]  Well, it's cool you coming on because Peter can chop this up and put out a little video that folks can share.
[33:46.540 --> 33:48.540]  And that'll just kind of get around a little bit better and be helpful.
[33:49.540 --> 34:32.530]  So we'll for sure get it out, man.
[34:47.130 --> 34:48.130]  Yeah, fuck yeah, man.
[34:49.130 --> 34:50.130]  It's really cool.
[34:55.410 --> 34:56.410]  Dude.
[35:18.200 --> 35:22.200]  How do we address it? You say the C-block?
[36:27.060 --> 36:32.060]  All right, man. Well, we'll get it out and really appreciate you, dude.
[36:33.060 --> 36:52.300]  Yeah, man.
[36:53.300 --> 36:58.960]  I'll talk to you again soon.
[36:58.960 --> 36:59.960]  All right, dude. Take care.
[37:00.960 --> 37:01.960]  Later.
[37:08.010 --> 37:16.010]  It's insane what they're I mean, Christian, I think they were looking they wanted him to take or am I muted?
[37:17.010 --> 37:18.010]  No, no.
[37:18.010 --> 37:21.010]  They wanted him to take a plea deal of nine years.
[37:21.010 --> 37:24.010]  And I was just like, it's fucking insane.
[37:29.010 --> 37:33.010]  All right. Well, to change the topic.
[37:34.010 --> 37:35.010]  Welcome.
[37:35.010 --> 37:36.010]  Yeah.
[37:36.010 --> 37:37.010]  A little change of pace.
[37:39.010 --> 37:40.010]  How are you guys doing?
[37:41.010 --> 37:42.010]  On another note.
[37:42.010 --> 37:44.010]  Very holy with the light shining in.
[37:46.010 --> 37:47.010]  Yeah, that's nice.
[37:48.010 --> 37:51.010]  It's I'm down in sunny Florida these days.
[37:51.010 --> 37:54.010]  So I'm sitting next to a pool next to a pond.
[37:54.010 --> 37:55.010]  Double waters.
[37:55.010 --> 37:56.010]  Could be worse, I suppose.
[37:58.010 --> 38:00.010]  Yeah, double, double up sitting in a birdhouse.
[38:01.010 --> 38:03.010]  Yeah, double, double up sitting in a birdcage.
[38:03.010 --> 38:13.470]  Mr. V was just about to set you up and kind of talk about what makes you special as a breeder.
[38:14.470 --> 38:16.470]  So is he is he still he's.
[38:17.470 --> 38:18.470]  Yeah, I'm here.
[38:18.470 --> 38:20.470]  I don't know why the dang video went off.
[38:20.470 --> 38:21.470]  I don't know how to fix that.
[38:22.470 --> 38:23.470]  Farmer.
[38:23.470 --> 38:26.470]  I don't know how to mess with this technology, but maybe I'll come back.
[38:27.470 --> 38:28.470]  His phone's not made out of microbes.
[38:28.470 --> 38:29.470]  He doesn't know.
[38:29.470 --> 38:30.470]  You know, it's true.
[38:31.470 --> 38:35.470]  So let me let me kind of tell you about this Avery fellow, how I come across him.
[38:35.470 --> 38:40.470]  This company, Bob Slade, had hired both of us at the same time to do consulting.
[38:40.470 --> 38:41.470]  We're both consultants.
[38:41.470 --> 38:42.470]  And he was working.
[38:43.470 --> 38:45.470]  He was working in an area and I was working in an area.
[38:46.470 --> 38:54.470]  And in most cases where I've been in this situation, working with two consultants on the same farm, it's usually been they don't.
[38:54.470 --> 38:56.470]  It's not a work together kind of a scene.
[38:56.470 --> 39:03.470]  Most cannabis growers have an ego and they just they know they have the best way and they're going to show it to the company and they don't want anyone to tell them anything else.
[39:03.470 --> 39:05.470]  But this Avery guy, he was a little bit different.
[39:06.470 --> 39:13.470]  And and I noticed we had this one issue where we had one of the greenhouses and me and the operating manager and Avery were kind of talking about it for a minute.
[39:14.470 --> 39:16.470]  And we none of us came up with the answer at that moment.
[39:17.470 --> 39:21.470]  But, you know, like an hour and a half went by and I'm in the greenhouse still by myself.
[39:21.470 --> 39:22.470]  And I looked down the hallway.
[39:22.470 --> 39:24.470]  It was a long, long hallway through a warehouse.
[39:25.470 --> 39:28.470]  And I see this man walking and he's from the East Coast now.
[39:28.470 --> 39:34.470]  OK, so you can tell this guy can put you in the mouth, but he also is very common and can handle a baby nice, too.
[39:34.470 --> 39:37.470]  But he had that walk. And I'm thinking to myself, damn, he's onto something.
[39:38.470 --> 39:41.470]  And when that man has a walk like that, you know, you could just tell he has some knowledge.
[39:42.470 --> 39:44.470]  And he come up to me and he says, Humistat.
[39:45.470 --> 39:49.470]  And he nailed what we needed for that greenhouse to make make the system work.
[39:49.470 --> 39:56.470]  And to me, I kind of sat there and I thought, here's a man who was not satisfied with not having the answer.
[39:57.470 --> 39:59.470]  And it wasn't an answer for him to have for himself.
[39:59.470 --> 40:00.470]  He was given a collective answer.
[40:01.470 --> 40:10.470]  So for me to work with a consultant and the manager of that site together, that's exactly why people hire us for when that kind of chemistry can happen.
[40:10.470 --> 40:16.470]  So I knew Avery right off the bat was kind of tick different than most of the really good growers that I've dealt with.
[40:17.470 --> 40:19.470]  You know, a really good grower has a really big ego.
[40:20.470 --> 40:23.470]  But Avery has a he has a different like he's itching for something different.
[40:24.470 --> 40:25.470]  And it's not it's not the dollar bill.
[40:26.470 --> 40:28.470]  It's like he really wanted to bring something out in the plants.
[40:29.470 --> 40:31.470]  So he had a whole room full of genetics he was working on.
[40:32.470 --> 40:33.470]  And I'm working on the flower rooms.
[40:34.470 --> 40:40.470]  So when Avery left that that area of bobsled, I was able to run his full line of seeds and see what was happening.
[40:41.470 --> 40:42.470]  You know, every every grow site.
[40:43.470 --> 40:45.470]  Now, this is a tier two farm, a big area.
[40:46.470 --> 40:48.470]  We had a veg greenhouse with a bunch of different plants in it.
[40:49.470 --> 40:53.470]  And everybody always has an area of their garden that just gets neglected.
[40:54.470 --> 40:55.470]  And I always would tell my manager, we're torturing these things.
[40:56.470 --> 40:57.470]  You figure out what you're going to do with them.
[40:58.470 --> 40:59.470]  Either take them out or, you know, let's transplant them.
[41:00.470 --> 41:01.470]  And a lot of them are Avery's genetics.
[41:02.470 --> 41:03.470]  And they sat in this greenhouse for a while.
[41:04.470 --> 41:05.470]  And these plants would sometimes start to dip out.
[41:06.470 --> 41:07.470]  They're in one gallon pots.
[41:08.470 --> 41:09.470]  I'd get on my manager.
[41:09.470 --> 41:10.470]  I'd say, you know, bring them back.
[41:11.470 --> 41:12.470]  We're going to we're going to use them again.
[41:13.470 --> 41:14.470]  We had to have backup for different areas.
[41:15.470 --> 41:16.470]  And we weren't quite sure what we were doing.
[41:17.470 --> 41:18.470]  And even we're going to different farms.
[41:19.470 --> 41:25.470]  So trying to keep these plants alive, I noticed after about the third time where I was like, dude, I can't keep bouncing them back.
[41:26.470 --> 41:30.470]  I noticed there was a section of the plants where they were they were green and they were actually healthy.
[41:31.470 --> 41:33.470]  So I went over to those one gallon pots and try to pick one up.
[41:34.470 --> 41:37.470]  And the roots had busted through the root cloth and that tapped in.
[41:37.470 --> 41:38.470]  And this was like the first set.
[41:39.470 --> 41:44.470]  So then after that, like the whole greenhouse started to like root itself in through the cloth, fighting soil.
[41:45.470 --> 41:52.470]  So this really got me excited because it's like you can tell the microbials were leading the way for the root systems to find the earth.
[41:53.470 --> 41:57.470]  And those pots have such a vigorous will to live that they were all busted.
[41:58.470 --> 41:59.470]  We call it a jailbreak.
[42:00.470 --> 42:01.470]  They all busted out a pot and the boss couldn't even move them if he wanted to.
[42:02.470 --> 42:06.470]  So a lot of them got flowered right there in place through a one gallon rooted right into the earth.
[42:07.470 --> 42:12.470]  It's just amazing to watch these things just flower and flower fully, treated so badly and flowered fully.
[42:13.470 --> 42:21.470]  We had some that were treated like princesses, but even the ones that were neglected out just were fast and they kicked right at the at the June 22nd moon.
[42:22.470 --> 42:24.470]  Some of these things just automatically knew the time was kicking back.
[42:25.470 --> 42:27.470]  And when I'm growing up here in Portland, I'm a California grower.
[42:28.470 --> 42:29.470]  There's a lot of stuff we like to grow in California.
[42:30.470 --> 42:33.470]  We can't grow up here in a 45th parallel because we just don't have that kind of light.
[42:33.470 --> 42:40.470]  So I'm looking at like every stuff that matched the terpene profiles of the things we needed California style, but they were fast.
[42:41.470 --> 42:42.470]  They were getting done fast.
[42:43.470 --> 42:49.470]  So this this allows me to when I'm consulting to allow my clients to have good amount of product done in time.
[42:50.470 --> 42:54.470]  So the books are set terpene match because everybody's grabbing all the terpene selections that are hot.
[42:55.470 --> 42:58.470]  And he's stabilizing these things with a vigorous growth.
[42:58.470 --> 43:04.470]  So anytime I you know, if I could, I would grow that line for all my clients, but you know, clients choose their own lines.
[43:05.470 --> 43:09.470]  But his his line is definitely showing up more and more every year with with more of my consistent clients.
[43:10.470 --> 43:14.470]  And we're able to give them direct feedback on what we like and what's happening out there in the field.
[43:15.470 --> 43:18.470]  So that's kind of a little bit about Avery and kind of his passion.
[43:19.470 --> 43:25.470]  What I've learned from working with him is he's looking for he's looking for something different and he's not afraid to put the work in for it.
[43:25.470 --> 43:30.470]  Or even more important, make the partnerships with people that then can do the work with them.
[43:31.470 --> 43:36.470]  And that's why he's able to make the advancement so quickly, I think, in his line, because he's got a lot of people that want to help out on that.
[43:37.470 --> 43:39.470]  Who doesn't want to help a situation like that? Right.
[43:40.470 --> 43:43.470]  So so that makes a really good team and a good network.
[43:44.470 --> 43:45.470]  And your network is your net worth.
[43:46.470 --> 43:47.470]  Bottom line right there.
[43:48.470 --> 43:49.470]  Yeah, there's a lot of work to get done.
[43:50.470 --> 43:51.470]  So Avery, did he do you justice?
[43:52.470 --> 43:53.470]  I don't know. I suppose so.
[43:54.470 --> 43:55.470]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:56.470 --> 43:57.470]  Well, I appreciate you, brother.
[43:58.470 --> 44:00.470]  It's been a while since I've had the chance to talk to Mr. V.
[44:01.470 --> 44:02.470]  Tapic.
[44:03.470 --> 44:05.470]  Yeah, it's always great to talk with him.
[44:06.470 --> 44:09.470]  He's one of those guys who just brings the energy to a garden and just to the people around him.
[44:10.470 --> 44:22.470]  It's like you said, you know, being a consultant and having a second consultant on the same at the same location can definitely cause some some concerns and some head butting and kind of like a hangover.
[44:23.470 --> 44:24.470]  Hey, listen to what I'm doing.
[44:25.470 --> 44:27.470]  But we were able just to kind of help each other out and work through things.
[44:28.470 --> 44:29.470]  He taught me a ton of stuff.
[44:30.470 --> 44:34.470]  And, you know, I got back on my kind of on my regenerative cannabis game because of Quatamoc.
[44:35.470 --> 44:42.470]  I had gone down a path of some other commercial products and had, you know, just for managing other farms had kind of gone that direction.
[44:43.470 --> 44:48.470]  And then after working with him, I dove straight back into Bokashi and started making all my own Bokashi again.
[44:48.470 --> 44:53.470]  And, you know, really getting into ferments and trying to start powering that stuff back into a lot of my processes.
[44:54.470 --> 44:55.470]  And I couldn't be more thankful for that.
[44:56.470 --> 44:59.470]  You know, it really turned my gardens back around to where I where I was enjoying them before.
[45:01.470 --> 45:05.470]  So can you talk about your intent as a breeder?
[45:06.470 --> 45:10.470]  Like what's you know, if you think about what you're trying to do as a breeder, what is it?
[45:11.470 --> 45:17.470]  And then also like what do you like to either grow or smoke yourself?
[45:18.470 --> 45:20.470]  And does that align with what you breed?
[45:21.470 --> 45:22.470]  Yeah, for sure.
[45:23.470 --> 45:26.470]  So my company name is Old Factory Genetics.
[45:27.470 --> 45:31.470]  It's all about the terpene profiles and high levels of cannabinoids.
[45:32.470 --> 45:33.470]  You know that the flowers just got to stink.
[45:34.470 --> 45:39.470]  I don't I don't have a whole lot of desire to keep on hunting through stuff if it doesn't just straight up stink.
[45:40.470 --> 45:44.470]  You know, and that's that's what it boils down to is it's got to stand out in the garden.
[45:45.470 --> 45:47.470]  I work a lot in commercial settings.
[45:48.470 --> 45:54.470]  I was a manager at Heroes of the Farm for a couple of years and helped, you know, kind of they had a lot of stuff in action.
[45:55.470 --> 45:57.470]  But I was able to start bringing some more systems into place.
[45:58.470 --> 46:03.470]  And I was there through the construction of four more greenhouses and a bunch of a bunch of build out.
[46:04.470 --> 46:11.470]  And during that process, had a lot of opportunity to learn about breeding and just kind of about how the plant works.
[46:12.470 --> 46:18.470]  And then, like Quattamoc said, you know, I worked at a couple other large scale places, Bobsled Gardens.
[46:19.470 --> 46:20.470]  I worked at Cannabis Nation for a little bit.
[46:21.470 --> 46:29.470]  Now I'm over here in Florida and I'm working at another large facility, helping with some consulting needs and trying to get a bunch of problems kind of figured out and back in line.
[46:30.470 --> 46:34.470]  So a lot of my breeding goes back to the need for commercial production lines.
[46:35.470 --> 46:42.470]  Stuff that can grow easily, can grow quickly, needs to yield well, just has to have a bag of peel and desire to it.
[46:43.470 --> 46:44.470]  You know, it kind of has to have the whole package.
[46:45.470 --> 46:49.470]  But I that that's where a lot of my my game goes.
[46:50.470 --> 46:51.470]  And it's all about smell and the structure of the plant.
[46:52.470 --> 46:58.470]  In my mindset, in a commercial scenario, if you don't have the proper structure of a plant, then those plants are going to get left behind.
[46:59.470 --> 47:06.470]  They're the more work that has to be put into a plant, the less work is going to get put into a plant is the way it seems to always go with employees.
[47:07.470 --> 47:09.470]  You know, they have an expectation of it takes this long to get a plant done.
[47:10.470 --> 47:13.470]  Some genetics take longer than that, and oftentimes stuff gets neglected.
[47:13.470 --> 47:22.470]  So a big factor that I try and breed towards is making sure that there's a nice, strong structure to the plant where it's going to be able to support itself as well as possible.
[47:23.470 --> 47:26.470]  And, you know, it just kind of needs as minimal input as we can get.
[47:27.470 --> 47:29.470]  That's definitely kind of one of my big goals.
[47:30.470 --> 47:32.470]  And so that, you know, that's.
[47:34.470 --> 47:40.470]  A lot of these facilities, you know, there's plants that start to get real lanky and real stocky or not stocky.
[47:40.470 --> 47:43.470]  They start to get real lanky and, you know, they need a lot of extra pruning.
[47:44.470 --> 47:46.470]  There's a lot of secondary growth that needs to be cleaned out from things.
[47:47.470 --> 47:49.470]  And, you know, that that stuff just gets difficult.
[47:50.470 --> 47:57.470]  So I do my best to hunt for phenos that have low to medium stretch just kind of across the board.
[47:58.470 --> 48:06.470]  Anytime I can find a male that's just got real stout, stocky branching, you know, that and a stem that smells, that's going to be my first go to.
[48:06.470 --> 48:17.470]  If I can find a dude that just has some real stout branching that I know is going to hold weight, but has also got that stink on the stem, then that's what's going to pass along for me.
[48:18.470 --> 48:22.470]  And that's kind of my main desire in a male side of things.
[48:23.470 --> 48:28.470]  So in regards to what I smoke, it's all about the gas for me.
[48:28.470 --> 48:37.470]  You know, when I when I breed, I like to do different projects that are going to bring in different terpene profiles so that customers can have a wide range of things to choose from.
[48:38.470 --> 48:41.470]  But when, you know, when it comes down to my preferences, it's all about the gas.
[48:42.470 --> 48:45.470]  I love headband. I love all the chems.
[48:46.470 --> 48:48.470]  So I do a good bit of work with those.
[48:49.470 --> 48:53.470]  You know, they can be tough because they can pass along some intersex traits.
[48:54.470 --> 48:59.470]  But, you know, this day and age, that's kind of to be expected with the level of polyhybridism that's going on.
[49:00.470 --> 49:02.470]  So I for me, it's all about the flavor.
[49:03.470 --> 49:08.470]  So when I find those strains that really pass those noses along, then that's what I'm going to stick with.
[49:09.470 --> 49:17.470]  And I my my two first strains that I ever bred about four years ago, I was working Heroes of the Farm and I was about to shut down my gardens at home.
[49:18.470 --> 49:25.470]  Just because I was working so much at the facility all the time that I had no desire to do anything in the garden once I got home.
[49:26.470 --> 49:31.470]  And so I I'd had a male just kind of kicking around kind of as I pop seeds.
[49:32.470 --> 49:40.470]  If I found a stinky male that kind of fit the parameters I wanted, then I would put him aside just to kind of see, you know, see, see if I want to do something eventually.
[49:40.470 --> 49:43.470]  And one of my co-workers, I told him I'll shut down my garden.
[49:44.470 --> 49:48.470]  And he was like, yo, why don't you why don't you do a quick breeding project?
[49:49.470 --> 49:53.470]  He said he had a male. And so I hit a Kim D and I hit a headband.
[49:54.470 --> 49:56.470]  And the headband is a cut from Oregon.
[49:57.470 --> 49:59.470]  It was held by on Facebook.
[50:00.470 --> 50:03.470]  He goes by Broski, King of Babylon 6 on on Instagram.
[50:04.470 --> 50:10.470]  And it's a it's a bit different of a cut and it's just super fire, just super gassy.
[50:11.470 --> 50:14.470]  So I had the Kim D for a while and I was going to pollinate that one.
[50:14.470 --> 50:18.470]  But I asked Pat at Heroes of the Farm if he'd be cool with me pollinating that headband mom.
[50:18.470 --> 50:20.470]  And he was he was kind enough to pass her along to me.
[50:20.470 --> 50:23.470]  And so those are the only two girls that I did that first time.
[50:24.470 --> 50:31.470]  And it was really just a learning experience for me, you know, just to go through the process of pollinating and to see, you know, what what it looked like.
[50:31.470 --> 50:39.470]  What the maturation process was kind of when seeds took place, you know, just kind of all the all the basic stuff because I had never really done it before.
[50:40.470 --> 50:47.470]  And so I did those two crosses. The headband crosses called Tibbet Knob and the Kim Cross.
[50:48.470 --> 50:51.470]  It's called Dog Mountain. And those are two of my favorite hikes.
[50:51.470 --> 50:54.470]  I've named a number of things after hikes from back home in Virginia.
[50:54.470 --> 50:59.470]  I grew up in Virginia and some hikes in Oregon, things along those lines.
[50:59.470 --> 51:01.470]  But those are my two my first two crosses.
[51:03.470 --> 51:07.470]  Both in the both in the direction of gas for sure.
[51:07.470 --> 51:12.470]  They're crossed to a squirrel killer male. The squirrel killer was from Pollination Genetics.
[51:14.470 --> 51:18.470]  And the reason I liked him, the stem just absolutely reeked on this guy.
[51:18.470 --> 51:21.470]  And he was so vigorous in a one gallon pot.
[51:21.470 --> 51:26.470]  I, you know, I kept on having to clone him and cut him back and just had big old families on him.
[51:26.470 --> 51:30.470]  So I kept him around for a couple months and then finally ended up throwing him into flower.
[51:30.470 --> 51:35.470]  And he threw on big old flower sacks, you know, and he just dumped pollen all over the place.
[51:35.470 --> 51:37.470]  So, you know, for a first run, it was a lot of fun.
[51:39.470 --> 51:43.470]  And that's definitely kind of the beginning root of some of my strains.
[51:43.470 --> 51:49.470]  You know, Tibbet Knob is probably the first one that I can get into and kind of start talking about.
[51:50.470 --> 51:52.470]  That's the headband mom.
[51:52.470 --> 51:56.470]  I know I've got a decent amount of packs of those left, but not too awful much.
[51:56.470 --> 52:00.470]  I did some I selected a Tibbet Knob male recently and did some crosses with it.
[52:00.470 --> 52:04.470]  So I did make a Tibbet Knob F2 with after testing it.
[52:08.470 --> 52:14.470]  Sorry, I'm just to throw out real quick. Seeds are available on www.daga.com.
[52:14.470 --> 52:16.470]  Peter will throw it up.
[52:17.470 --> 52:25.470]  So just as he's going through this, if this strikes your fancy, maybe open a window and pop over there because it might go away.
[52:25.470 --> 52:27.470]  So I just want to throw that in there.
[52:29.470 --> 52:33.470]  We had some pre sales before we even went live.
[52:33.470 --> 52:36.470]  So all right. So we're going out of order. Totally fine.
[52:36.470 --> 52:40.470]  Let's start with you want to start with Tibbet Knob because I feel like you set the table.
[52:40.470 --> 52:42.470]  You got a lot of stuff going on.
[52:42.470 --> 52:45.470]  You got your hype man who hyped you up.
[52:45.470 --> 52:47.470]  You talked about your intent as a breeder.
[52:47.470 --> 52:51.470]  And now we're just going to go right down the line, starting with Tibbet Knob.
[52:51.470 --> 52:54.470]  So, yeah, talk about it.
[52:54.470 --> 52:59.470]  Yeah. So Tibbet Knob is first train of bread.
[52:59.470 --> 53:01.470]  She's you know, I just F2 her.
[53:01.470 --> 53:06.470]  So the whatever is left on on line in stock is all that there is of this one.
[53:06.470 --> 53:08.470]  Just super gassy girl.
[53:08.470 --> 53:16.470]  The one that I selected, I hunted one hundred and forty four seeds and I germinated about 18 females that kind of passed the initial test.
[53:16.470 --> 53:19.470]  So structure and stem rub and things along those lines.
[53:19.470 --> 53:23.470]  And they all they all did great for me.
[53:23.470 --> 53:31.470]  But the one that I ended up selecting number 12 had super tennis ball turps, just kind of like tennis balls and gassy girl.
[53:31.470 --> 53:35.470]  And fuel, you know, those are kind of the main notes that came out of it.
[53:35.470 --> 53:38.470]  There's some pics that he's throwing up up there.
[53:38.470 --> 53:40.470]  So she definitely chunks out pretty good.
[53:40.470 --> 53:47.470]  I'm definitely not a large yielder by any means, but definitely in the medium to average to above average level of things.
[53:47.470 --> 53:49.470]  But super gassy.
[53:49.470 --> 53:53.470]  Most phenotypes finished in 60 to 70 days.
[53:53.470 --> 53:57.470]  The one that I got was a female that was about a hundred and forty four.
[53:57.470 --> 54:00.470]  Phenotypes finished in 60 to 70 days.
[54:00.470 --> 54:08.470]  The one that I selected, number 12, I decided that she's going to run about, I think, typically 70 days where I would push her to.
[54:08.470 --> 54:15.470]  These pictures are actually taken at about day 60, 65, 66, I believe.
[54:15.470 --> 54:20.470]  So she's, you know, she stretches about two, two and a half times.
[54:20.470 --> 54:26.470]  If you top her a couple of times and veg, then she'll put out a good number of tops for you.
[54:26.470 --> 54:27.470]  That's the mama right there.
[54:27.470 --> 54:32.470]  And she she threw down some good weight out of that pot.
[54:32.470 --> 54:35.470]  Yeah. All about gas on that one.
[54:35.470 --> 54:47.470]  Quattamoc, they actually ran her out at their out at their farm and they had some one single phenotype that actually came out with some Jack Herrera notes to it.
[54:47.470 --> 54:51.470]  There's some spicy Jack way back in the squirrel killer lineage.
[54:51.470 --> 54:59.470]  And I had never had any come any of those notes come through, but they they had one come through that had that just telltale Jack Herrera smell to it.
[54:59.470 --> 55:06.470]  Couldn't can't mistake it. You know, it's one of those things where you can barely breed Jack Herrera out of something if you wanted to.
[55:06.470 --> 55:11.470]  So it's kind of surprised how how recessive it is in this in this cross.
[55:11.470 --> 55:15.470]  But super gassy. Yeah.
[55:15.470 --> 55:24.470]  Sixty to 70 days or so. And she's she's great for oil and for hash production.
[55:24.470 --> 55:29.470]  We did. My buddy made some bubble hash and some rosen out of some trim for me.
[55:29.470 --> 55:33.470]  And I think it was in the seven or 8 percent return, something along those lines.
[55:33.470 --> 55:38.470]  And I've had her come back over 20 percent yield on oil.
[55:38.470 --> 55:46.470]  Just had some actually tested from a facility in Oregon, I think, came back in the 27 percent THC range, something along those lines.
[55:46.470 --> 55:52.470]  And I've had her test 25 percent THC at another facility and then the five percent terpene range,
[55:52.470 --> 55:59.470]  which is what I'm more excited about, the fact that she's got those that big five percent terpene level on some phenoses.
[55:59.470 --> 56:03.470]  You know, that's what I'm looking for right there. And I did.
[56:03.470 --> 56:06.470]  I want someone to have a bag and not even need to open it.
[56:06.470 --> 56:09.470]  You know, just stinks up the room and someone pulls it out of their pocket kind of thing.
[56:09.470 --> 56:15.470]  So that that's kind of the main gist of of Tibbet Knob.
[56:15.470 --> 56:19.470]  Any other questions about or anything you have in your mind? Yeah.
[56:19.470 --> 56:24.470]  Hold on. So we will we'll come back to it.
[56:25.470 --> 56:30.470]  Since we're only one, we're only on number one.
[56:30.470 --> 56:44.470]  But out of all of your line that we have available, if you're thinking like New England and I mean, you know, I'd say Washington state kind of northern climates.
[56:44.470 --> 56:50.470]  Yeah, definitely. Sleeper hold is going to be way up on that list.
[56:50.470 --> 56:56.470]  That's the L.A. pure cush cross with the Adam Dunn Afghan cush.
[56:56.470 --> 57:04.470]  And that one is, you know, 50 to 55 day kind of indoor flower, like legitimately from flipping 1212.
[57:04.470 --> 57:08.470]  You'll start at something. Those are going to be finishing in less than eight weeks.
[57:08.470 --> 57:12.470]  And you'll you know, you'll definitely have some that will finish outdoors.
[57:12.470 --> 57:18.470]  Late September kind of thing. Blue Ridge eclipse. I believe there's still some of those in stock.
[57:18.470 --> 57:24.470]  If there are still some of those in stock, that is the only ones that are left in stock until I make enough to have it.
[57:24.470 --> 57:32.470]  Blue Ridge eclipse. I have heard the best success out of people out of any of my gear in Michigan.
[57:32.470 --> 57:42.470]  But he's got one little Johnny Gardens on Instagram and his his his finishes the third or fourth week of September.
[57:42.470 --> 57:59.470]  And then I have had some also finished in that Blue Ridge eclipse is that's truth tree, which is bred by Boneyard Genetics, which is I believe it's a Redwood cush cross is kind of escaping me right now.
[57:59.470 --> 58:04.470]  But it's truth tree crossed with Mandelbrot, Royal Cush seven crosses Redwood Cush.
[58:04.470 --> 58:10.470]  And then that's crossed to Tibbett Knob, a Tibbett Knob male that I'd selected out of Heroes of the Farm a couple of years ago.
[58:10.470 --> 58:21.470]  And that Blue Ridge eclipse it. I'll talk about it more later, I suppose. I don't even know if we've got pictures of it on here, but I would check that one out for sure as well.
[58:21.470 --> 58:28.470]  And then there's also a sit an offshoot of Blue Ridge eclipse called Big Schloss that's crossed with Black Lime Reserve.
[58:28.470 --> 58:38.470]  And that's another one that has those quick flower time. So of the three, I would say Sleeper Hold, Big Schloss and Blue Ridge eclipse are going to be the three the three biggest winners for that.
[58:38.470 --> 58:41.470]  So I think you touched on this.
[58:41.470 --> 58:42.470]  Go ahead.
[58:42.470 --> 58:53.470]  Just real quick. What soil medium are you growing and doing your selections in? You kind of touched on that just going in. I mean, it's soil, but if you want to elaborate.
[58:53.470 --> 58:59.470]  Yeah. So the base of my soil was Nectar for the Gods number four soil.
[58:59.470 --> 59:03.470]  And then I've I've been recycling that for probably three or four years.
[59:03.470 --> 59:09.470]  But I run a basic Kutz mix for the most part. I do use a couple Nectar for the Gods thing.
[59:09.470 --> 59:16.470]  I use their one shot product there. That's just kind of like their granular slow release organic fertilizer.
[59:16.470 --> 59:22.470]  I use that in veg. It's just it absolutely crushes plants. Just go crazy with it.
[59:22.470 --> 59:30.470]  But yeah, the Kutz mix is kind of my main thing. Kutz mix biochar, the homeboy Quatamoc, he got me way back in my game again.
[59:30.470 --> 59:37.470]  So I'm all about using the Kutz with biochar. I make my own Bokashi.
[59:37.470 --> 59:43.470]  A lot of times I use different ferments in my Bokashi. So I'll do like a comfrey Bokashi or like, you know,
[59:43.470 --> 59:49.470]  purslane Bokashi or, you know, things along those lines to have some different effects from it.
[59:49.470 --> 59:55.470]  And then all about doing the fermentation. So I do a lot of those fermentations.
[59:55.470 --> 59:58.470]  I don't have a property right now. I'm in the process of looking for a house.
[59:58.470 --> 01:00:02.470]  But back in Portland, I had comfrey planted all over. I lived right in Portland,
[01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:07.470]  but I had pretty much a whole permaculture set up at our property there where I had comfrey planted all over the place
[01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:12.470]  and used artichoke leaves for biomass, for compost and things along those lines.
[01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:18.470]  But I try and do as much as I can with what I have available.
[01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:22.470]  So staying on the Tibet knob, you see that one?
[01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:29.470]  Yep. Yeah. So there's a couple of different phenos. Some of them, there's a couple that are a little bit lankier.
[01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:33.470]  And oftentimes when you're flowering out, you'll see those earlier on.
[01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:36.470]  And they're typically my less desired phenotypes.
[01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:40.470]  They usually have a little bit lower terpene profile, the stretchier ones.
[01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:46.470]  And they do have a little bit of tendency towards that longer, skinnier, secondary growth.
[01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:55.470]  But then the other pheno that mimics a little bit more of the headband mom that she comes from is a little bit more stout.
[01:00:55.470 --> 01:01:00.470]  And so that pheno definitely has a much stronger branching structure.
[01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:05.470]  The number 12 that I selected, that's the flower there from her.
[01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:10.470]  She definitely needs staking just from the size of flowers that she put on.
[01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:16.470]  But put on a good size flower for the structure of the plant.
[01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:25.470]  I would say that typically in veg, I would top her a couple of times and then expect a two and a half time stretch, something along those lines.
[01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:32.470]  But there's a lot of phenos that have kind of minimal side branching and have larger, larger cola sets on them.
[01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:34.470]  And that's kind of what I'm looking for in them.
[01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:38.470]  And that's what I would recommend looking for when you're looking through the female side of things.
[01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:45.470]  If you're the kind of person that doesn't want to flower out everything and you're a little bit pickier about what you're going to put into flowers,
[01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:52.470]  then some of the stockier phenos are going to typically be a little bit gassier and have a little bit stronger nose on them.
[01:01:53.470 --> 01:02:05.400]  Okay. So that was the Tibbets.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:08.400]  And is that one of your hikes in Virginia?
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.400]  Yeah, that's a hike back in Virginia.
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:16.400]  So it's a rock outcropping that overlooks West Virginia.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:22.400]  It's the first place I ever smoked kind bud, the KB from back in the 90s.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:32.400]  So I used to eat acid up there, get good and spun and smoke weed up on this rock outcropping that just overlooked all these beautiful rolling hills of the Appalachian Mountains.
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.400]  And so it has a close place in my heart for sure.
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.400]  It's one of those places that whenever I go back home, I do my best to make it up there.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:48.400]  So going, getting back to alphabetical order, you ready for some Big Schloss?
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.400]  Sure. Yeah, for sure.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.400]  So that actually kind of works out well. Big Schloss is the sister hike to Tibbet Knob.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:01.400]  So it's just on the other side and the rock outcropping there actually overlooks the Virginia side of things.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:06.400]  So it's kind of the hikes kind of go right along the ridge there, separate West Virginia from Virginia.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.400]  And that's that's where I grew up in the Woodstock, Virginia area.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:15.400]  So Big Schloss is one of those quicker flowering ones that I was describing.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:20.400]  The mother to Big Schloss is Blue Ridge Eclipse. That's one of the ones that I've read as well.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:25.400]  Blue Ridge Eclipse is truth tree across the Tibbet Knob.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:34.400]  So I, I flowered a not a bunch, you know, four or five of the Blue Ridge Eclipse in my backyard.
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:44.400]  I think three years ago or so, two years ago. And they just stunk so loud, you know, just like hashy coffee, sour,
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:52.400]  you know, like fuely noses to them, but a lot of old school kind of hash and like coffee kind of notes to them.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:56.400]  And she was finishing so damn fast. You know, I, I just kind of couldn't resist.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:05.400]  But to pollinate her, my buddy, Riley Flood, who's Eclectic Elegance Genetics, had selected some black lime reserve males.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.400]  He selected two males and he collected pollen from them.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:13.400]  He was kind enough to share some of that pollen with me. And so I had a few different things with it.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:21.400]  One of them, you know, kind of the one that I really wanted to do is the orange cookies cross we'll get to later on.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.400]  Orange is the new black lime. But I had some extra pollen left over.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:30.400]  And this this mother was, you know, was only a few weeks in the flowers that was just huge on it.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.400]  It just stunk to high hell. I couldn't help but throw some pollen on it.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:39.400]  And so I collected the seeds from that. And that would be the big schloss seeds.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:46.400]  And those the big schlosses, Blue Ridge Eclipse, black lime reserve.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:52.400]  The black lime reserve added some serious funk to this thing, you know, like some some skunky notes.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:57.400]  One of my friends described it really well is spicy Thai basil.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:04.400]  So some of those kind of kind of smells go rolling through it. But definitely some skunky notes go through it.
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.400]  You know, a lot of a lot of people are looking for that roadkill. Where's the roadkill?
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.400]  Where's the roadkill? This definitely isn't roadkill.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:15.400]  But there's certainly some notes where you give a squeeze and give a sniff on it.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:19.400]  It's like, oh, there's some skunk in there for sure. But she's loud.
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:23.400]  Has some of those similar like sour kind of notes as the mom.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:31.400]  But more more than anything, just kind of there's some there's some garlicky funk that goes through them.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:39.400]  Those pictures are grown by Blockwork Grower on IG. He's actually working with out here in Florida now.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:45.400]  But there she finishes, you know, really in the 56 to 65 day range, I would say.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:52.400]  Some phenos go a little bit into that 65 ish range, but some of them will definitely finish in the 56 range.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:06:00.400]  She's most most of the phenos and that have a real tight structure to them with very minimal stretch to them and not a lot of lankiness.
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:05.400]  The Blue Ridge Eclipse mom definitely pushed that through as a dominant trait big time.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:11.400]  And so that one is one that, you know, it's great for commercial. It grows fairly quickly.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:17.400]  It's got good, strong branching and it is just loud. It's one that people regularly get packs of it.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:25.400]  And it's one of the ones that I most often get a reply back from people are just like, dude, you've got to smell this thing and veg or like, you know,
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:30.400]  like I'm week five and it is just overpowering my whole room kind of thing.
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:35.400]  I haven't had a chance to grow out a whole lot of them yet. I've only grown out five or six of them myself of the big sloths.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:39.400]  But every one of them had a big nose on them. You know, they're out of a pack of 10.
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:44.400]  There was easily two or three keepers that I would have been happy with running again.
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:50.400]  I'm planning on taking that one further for sure. But I'm I'll I'll be hunting through a couple hundred seeds on that one.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:57.400]  There's there's a good bit of stock on that one. But it's one that definitely, you know, it's worth putting in the collection to get to.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:02.400]  If you don't have a space for it right now, because she is loud. That Black-Eyed Reserve.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:07.400]  There's a lot of Black-Eyed Reserve crosses out there these days, and I completely understand why, you know,
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:14.400]  that those genetics and lineage and that stuff really, really puts out some some fantastic work.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.400]  It kind of seems to make everything hulk out a little bit further.
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:24.400]  You know, it just it makes those plants just that much stronger on all the crosses I've seen.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:33.400]  You know, everything else kind of steps it up, gets a really frosty look to it and just carries those loud noses.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.400]  Hey, Gunja Farmers, check it out. I'm going to have to bounce. My battery's almost gone.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:40.400]  But it's nice talking and meeting everybody. Keep it rolling.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:45.400]  Good seeing you, brother V. We should get together and chat soon.
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:52.060]  Yeah, anytime. Stay up. Good to see you, Avery. We'll be in touch.
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:57.930]  That dude's one of the best guys out there.
[01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:06.930]  OK, so we've we're on Big Schloss. Anyone have any questions about Big Schloss?
[01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:20.450]  Before we move on. All right. So up next, we have.
[01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:24.450]  Litchfield, got a little spelling error, but you're close.
[01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:31.780]  What's the spelling? L-I-T-C-H.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:39.780]  Yeah, so that's I did. That's an offspring of the Orange is a New Black Lime that I made.
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:43.780]  And so that's orange cookies across the Black Lime Reserve.
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:53.780]  Litchfield is East Coast Sour Diesel crossed with that a male from that Orange is a New Black Lime.
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:58.780]  That East Coast Sour Diesel, you know, it's one of those where it is kind of everybody's favorite.
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:03.780]  But people are having a hard time finding the mom that's worth growing out still kind of thing.
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:10.780]  You know, she's I feel like it's one of those cuts has been passed around and beaten down so hard for so long that she is just kind of struggling.
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:20.780]  Every time I every time I get a cut of it, I get so stoked and then I grow it out and I'm less excited than I'm hoping I'm going to be.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:27.780]  So when I see her and and polyhybrids, though, I kind of see some of the older glory that that comes out from her.
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:30.780]  You know, it kind of seems to reinvigorate her a little bit.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:36.780]  The cut of the cut of East Coast Sour that I got was from my buddy, Micro Prop 420.
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:43.780]  And he's been holding on to the cut since, you know, the late 90s, I believe, maybe mid 90s, early 2000s, something along those lines.
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:49.780]  But, you know, he's he's a plant pathologist who's been.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:53.780]  You know, he's been doing tissue culture and he's got so much plant knowledge.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:10:02.780]  It's absolutely remarkable. And he so he's been holding this cut for a long time and was kind enough to share her with me.
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:16.780]  And she she has those typical East Coast Sour diesel kind of flower structure, you know, it's got that very much kind of that airy, almost like feathery looking flower structure.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:22.780]  And man, she is just sticky, just so resonated and just completely decked out trichomes.
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:29.780]  Has a lot of that East Coast Sour diesel fuely funk to it.
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:39.780]  But the orange is a new black lime definitely adds in some phenotypes that carry some of that orange kind of flavor profile, some limey flavor profiles.
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:44.780]  So there's definitely some stuff that kind of goes a little bit fruity, but it all has some of that fuel backing to it.
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:51.780]  And it's the orange is the new black lime definitely shortens the flower time on some phenos a little bit.
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:59.780]  The you know, the typically the East Coast Sour diesel, we're going to be taking that 70, 75 days, 72 to 75.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:04.780]  There's some phenotypes that get reduced down into the 63, 65 range.
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:10.780]  Yeah, definitely has has some strong noses.
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:15.780]  It's just super sticky, you know, like that's I can't say enough about that aspect of her.
[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:18.780]  She's just completely decked out, frosty.
[01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:22.780]  These were some light depths, some early season light depths.
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:27.780]  I believe these were harvested in mid early July, I think out at Springwater Farms.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.780]  That was where that's where Kwatamak is working.
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:36.780]  So this was all soil grown, all soil grown, all microbial, all the good stuff.
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:40.780]  And yeah, they just they stack nicely.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.780]  I wouldn't say that it's a huge yield.
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:48.780]  It's definitely an average, maybe slightly above, but at the very least an average in regards to weight.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:51.780]  But when it comes to cannabinoids, she's she's decked out.
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:56.780]  I would imagine we haven't I haven't had a chance to run run her and make bubble halfs.
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:03.780]  But just from the level of development on her, I can't imagine that she doesn't doesn't put out big time in that regard.
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:13.780]  So I I think that the the big thing from the orange is a new black line male that it definitely shortened things up and added some nose to her.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:15.780]  It just definitely made her louder.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:23.780]  And I like I said, I kind of see the reinvigoration of that East Coast sour diesel from from having that poly thrown into her.
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:27.780]  It just kind of kind of gives her a kick in the bum and lets her get moving again.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:34.780]  Yeah, I would say, you know, typically I haven't seen a whole lot of her grown up, to be completely honest.
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:38.780]  So I can't give a whole lot of recommendation in regards to the plant structure.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:48.780]  The couple that I did see there had a little they were a little bit stretchy, a little bit stretchier than I would select if it was something that I was going to be breeding further.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:56.780]  But I would imagine further in that profile, further into those phenotypes, there's definitely some more of those stockier kind of classes.
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:13:02.780]  Classier, more more along the classic kind of breeding that I go with for the most part.
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:10.780]  But there's, you know, the orange cookies mom on that is a little bit of a lanky girl who has a lot of that cookie structure to her.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:14.780]  But the black limers are kind of stock stuff up a little bit for me on that one.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:24.780]  So if you're looking for something that that's going to be a hash producer and have a loud nose, and I would say Litchfield is going to be a good girl for you.
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:30.780]  We'll take one last look at her.
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:35.780]  Everyone in chat is asking about the black lime reserve because it's it's woven into all that stuff.
[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:40.780]  They're just like folks that don't know about the black lime are asking about it and folks are answering.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:46.780]  And yeah, you have any any talk about it at all?
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:51.780]  So I don't have a whole lot of experience with growing her personally.
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:55.780]  You might honestly even have more experience with it than I do.
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:14:07.780]  In the black lime reserve, I have the cherry pie cross cherry west BX onto lime one.
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:08.780]  Yeah.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:13.780]  And I also have lime vines crosses.
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:15.780]  Yeah.
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:24.780]  So I've seen and also the sky gyro cross line pop, which is fucking an interesting.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:27.780]  I don't know. I was just telling Kaya this morning because I sent it all to him.
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:28.780]  He's washing it.
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:37.780]  And I was like, look at those LPK gyros, because when I was drying them, I open up the room and it'd be like so much lime and so much gas.
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:44.780]  It hurt my eyes a little bit, you know, like, yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:45.780]  Yeah.
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:56.780]  She you know, that kind of what Riley was telling me about some of the black lime reserve from from Jackson with Freedom Born Selections.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:15:02.780]  A lot of that skunky note that comes through is from the oil can that's in that.
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:15.780]  The Woodman Canyon oil can. And now and you know, I think he was saying that a lot of those notes are kind of are a bit recessive, but that that he has a feeling that that's kind of where some of those skunkier profiles come from in that one.
[01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:22.780]  And so, you know, there's there's Afghan Northern Lights, Purple Kush, Kim Dogg kind of all throughout those through that black lime reserve genetics.
[01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:29.780]  They have a lot of a lot of I feel like from what I recall from them, a lot of peppery notes, definitely some lime kind of smells to it.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:37.780]  For for me, the definitely the highlight of them is is kind of that that skunky funk that comes from them.
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:41.780]  And I have seen it in some other crosses that people have done with it.
[01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:50.780]  So just quickly, thanks to Chris, Nick, Owen, Brent, John, who are all of you.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:57.780]  That that oil can is, I think, is kind of the super special aspect in the background of that one.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:17.740]  So just quickly, thanks to Chris, Nick, Owen, Brent, John, who picked up some facts in the past couple of minutes.
[01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:24.290]  Thank you. Appreciate the support, everybody.
[01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:28.290]  So we were just. All right.
[01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:33.290]  So next up is the orange is the new black line.
[01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:36.290]  Yeah. So this one's a fun one.
[01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:41.290]  And, you know, I have a couple other crosses with it.
[01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:50.290]  I did them outside a couple of seasons ago and it was a super shitty season in Oregon where it started raining in mid-September.
[01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:54.290]  And man, I just had to try these problems all over the place.
[01:16:55.290 --> 01:16:56.290]  And so a bunch of stuff had to get pulled early.
[01:16:57.290 --> 01:17:00.290]  So some of the new crosses that I did with the orange is a new black line male.
[01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:02.290]  A lot of the seeds were a little bit immature.
[01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:05.290]  So I'm probably going to do some in-house breeding with those.
[01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:07.290]  Not necessarily release some of them.
[01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:11.290]  Litchfield is one of the ones I was able to take a little bit further and actually able to get them to full maturity.
[01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:13.290]  But the orange is a new black line.
[01:17:14.290 --> 01:17:17.290]  That was that I got this cut of orange cookies a few years back.
[01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:21.290]  And I don't know exactly.
[01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:24.290]  I believe someone said it was the Jungle Boys cut.
[01:17:25.290 --> 01:17:32.290]  But man, just the strongest orange, fresh orange stink that I've smelled on any cannabis.
[01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:34.290]  Just like the most tart, fresh orange.
[01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:40.290]  You know, like it smelled like a clementine was like ripped open and squeezed in your nose kind of thing.
[01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:43.290]  We had it at Heroes of the Farm for a little bit of time.
[01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:48.290]  And we didn't put it through production just because it had a lower THC count.
[01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:51.290]  So we ran it a few times and just had trouble selling it.
[01:17:52.290 --> 01:17:59.290]  Just because the way the market was in Oregon at the time was, and unfortunately a lot of places, is that if it doesn't say 25 to 30 percent THC, then nobody wants it.
[01:18:00.290 --> 01:18:07.290]  But, you know, out of a room of probably 100 something plants, there was four plants of the orange cookies.
[01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:11.290]  And it was pretty much the only thing that you could smell in the whole room.
[01:18:11.290 --> 01:18:14.290]  It just absolutely stunk like oranges.
[01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:18.290]  You know, there's tons of fire in there, Scooby snacks and all sorts of other stuff.
[01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:20.290]  But it just stunk.
[01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:27.290]  And so I, from as soon as I, you know, got that whiff of her, I just wanted to do a cross with her at some point.
[01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:32.290]  And she, she's great for oil production.
[01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:36.290]  You know, a lot of times I also do kind of go towards hash and oil production.
[01:18:37.290 --> 01:18:40.290]  I prefer hash myself over flour a lot of times.
[01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:42.290]  I do consume a good bit of hash.
[01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:44.290]  And so a lot of stuff goes back in that direction.
[01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:50.290]  But that orange cookies, definitely the orange citrus notes pass through big time into the hash that's made with her.
[01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:52.290]  Yeah.
[01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:58.290]  Yeah, that one, the 45 day.
[01:18:59.290 --> 01:19:02.290]  She's supposed to go, you know, some people say take her 45 days.
[01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:09.290]  I took her a couple more days than that, but certainly more, you know, that she is a fast finisher and good Lord, did she stink.
[01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:15.290]  So I pollinated her with that same Black Lime Reserve pollen that I made big schloss with.
[01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:19.290]  And man, it's a great cross.
[01:19:20.290 --> 01:19:21.290]  Just beautiful colors come out in her.
[01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:26.290]  Lots of incredible purples, like super, super dark purples come out in some of these crosses.
[01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:30.290]  But they'll have like speckling of lime green through the purpling.
[01:19:31.290 --> 01:19:32.290]  It's a really cool look that comes through her.
[01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:35.290]  And just decked out in frost, you know.
[01:19:35.290 --> 01:19:43.290]  She, the Black Lime Reserve definitely added some larger flower structure and a much more appealing plant structure in my mind.
[01:19:44.290 --> 01:19:54.290]  The orange cookies mom is a little bit stretchy for me and maintains that kind of smaller cookie, you know, real dense cookie flower.
[01:19:55.290 --> 01:20:03.290]  And so this, the Black Lime Reserve definitely kind of increased the flower size, but kind of loosened up the flower structure a little bit, if you will, you know, kind of.
[01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:09.290]  Took away some of that insane density and added a good bit of frost to it.
[01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:16.290]  You can tell real early on with these girls, which ones are going to lean towards the mom and which ones are going to lean towards the dads.
[01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:22.290]  The stemmer up on them comes across as orange cookies real quick.
[01:20:23.290 --> 01:20:29.290]  You can definitely get that orange smell, you know, from I pick some, you know, within a week or two of growth.
[01:20:29.290 --> 01:20:33.290]  They were just tiny little seedlings and already had orange smell on them.
[01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:38.290]  So if you're looking specifically for that kind of thing, a lot of times you can kind of pick and shovel through.
[01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:42.290]  They finish, they finished good and quick.
[01:20:43.290 --> 01:20:47.290]  You know, I'd say most stuff is about eight to nine weeks, most commonly with her.
[01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:51.290]  There's some stuff that you could maybe pull earlier if you wanted to.
[01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:55.290]  That was in my backyard the first year that I grew a couple out of seed.
[01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:59.290]  She threw down, was a big old girl.
[01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:05.290]  Yeah, so she can do all right outside.
[01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:09.290]  In my mind, I don't think that she yields quite well enough.
[01:21:10.290 --> 01:21:13.290]  I don't think the flower size is quite where I would want to be for outdoor productivity.
[01:21:14.290 --> 01:21:21.290]  But if it's terpene profiles you're looking for, then she's definitely one of the louder ones that I have available in my stock.
[01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:26.290]  And I believe that she's damn near sold out.
[01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:28.290]  You know, I think there's only five more packs.
[01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:34.290]  I don't recall exactly what I said, but there's only a handful more packs of her and then she's done.
[01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:38.290]  I will end up doing more work with her down the road, but that's a good ways out.
[01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:40.290]  You know, it'll be a couple of years before I get around to that one.
[01:21:41.290 --> 01:21:44.290]  Most likely I've just got too many other projects that I'm getting started on.
[01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:48.290]  So it's go time.
[01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:55.290]  Someone was asking in chat when restock, you know, and I think that question was because we're saying, you know, this stuff's going to sell out.
[01:21:56.290 --> 01:21:58.290]  And the reason is you're on the move.
[01:21:59.290 --> 01:22:01.290]  You've been in big transition since I even met you.
[01:22:02.290 --> 01:22:07.290]  You had a child and now you've moved to the complete opposite end of the country.
[01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:09.290]  Yeah.
[01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:12.290]  You're consulting and kind of taking over all this stuff.
[01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:16.290]  And so you don't, as far as I know, you don't have a garden set up right now.
[01:22:16.290 --> 01:22:21.290]  No, I'm taking care of a big, ugly garden.
[01:22:22.290 --> 01:22:23.290]  Yeah.
[01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:28.290]  So right now is, you know, we're in the process of looking for a house.
[01:22:29.290 --> 01:22:31.290]  But, you know, that whole thing's a little bit of lays out.
[01:22:32.290 --> 01:22:38.290]  I've got a bunch of stuff in testing at other people's gardens right now with people looking into stuff and growing out a bunch of things.
[01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:44.290]  I do have a bunch of genetics that I made right before I left because that was a big thing for me was, you know, I'm.
[01:22:44.290 --> 01:22:48.290]  I knew I wasn't going to have a garden for a while and so I couldn't maintain all the clones that I had.
[01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:53.290]  So I gave out clones to who I could give clones out to in hopes that I can get a lot of the stuff back.
[01:22:54.290 --> 01:23:02.290]  But knowing that how that typically goes in this industry, I just went ahead and pollinated everything that I had and made seeds of all of it.
[01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:06.290]  So now I at least have seeds to hunt through all this stuff and be able to look for it.
[01:23:07.290 --> 01:23:09.290]  But, you know, all this stuff is on the website right now.
[01:23:09.290 --> 01:23:13.290]  Honestly, the numbers that are there is what's there and I don't have any more stock of any of it.
[01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:18.290]  The tibid knob, there's an F2 of that, but I don't release stuff until stuff's tested.
[01:23:19.290 --> 01:23:22.290]  You know, it's got to be grown out by at least a couple of people before I'm willing to put it out there.
[01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:27.290]  So even on an F2, even though, you know, I'm confident in the parents, I'm still the kind of guy.
[01:23:28.290 --> 01:23:30.290]  I just want to see what it does before I put it out there.
[01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:33.290]  So whatever's on the website, what's on the website.
[01:23:34.290 --> 01:23:35.290]  That's pretty much it.
[01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:40.290]  And just quickly, this kind of gets the.
[01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:48.290]  This is why we're doing what we're doing, because I feel like, yeah, when you go on to like a seed bank website, it's just like.
[01:23:50.290 --> 01:24:04.290]  You know, I love the idea of getting to know the person, the person behind that breeder brand and kind of what they're all about and having them talk about.
[01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:07.290]  The genetics and, you know.
[01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:11.290]  How they grow, how they express themselves, etc.
[01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:15.290]  So that's kind of why this is exactly why we're doing what we're doing.
[01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:21.290]  Sorry, what's the website?
[01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:24.290]  Give me one second to throw that back.
[01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:28.290]  It's just, you know.
[01:24:31.290 --> 01:24:36.290]  Comment like that, your experience with the commercial setting is really what I just think is so valuable.
[01:24:37.290 --> 01:24:44.290]  And so when you attacked all these breeding projects, you're doing them in your house, in your in your room, in your backyard.
[01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:52.290]  It's not a huge area, but you're coming at it from a place of seeing so much and looking at how that's going to work in the larger scale.
[01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:54.290]  And so I think there's just.
[01:24:55.290 --> 01:25:00.290]  You know, at Heroes of the Farm, we were doing seed hunts of two, three, four thousand seeds at a time.
[01:25:01.290 --> 01:25:07.290]  You know, so just looking through that many seeds over that many times, you know, you start to get a feel for what you're looking for.
[01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:09.290]  You know, you can identify plants from afar.
[01:25:10.290 --> 01:25:11.290]  Like, oh, look at the branching on that one.
[01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:15.290]  You know, you start seeing things without having to see them as well.
[01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:18.290]  You know, it just kind of shows up in front of your face for you.
[01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:19.290]  Not many people get that opportunity.
[01:25:20.290 --> 01:25:23.290]  And I'm just realizing that is.
[01:25:24.290 --> 01:25:26.290]  Add that up to large populations.
[01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:31.290]  You know, when I said that the other day to a skunk man, he's like 20,000.
[01:25:32.290 --> 01:25:33.290]  I'm like, yeah, I know, dude, I know.
[01:25:34.290 --> 01:25:37.290]  But most people aren't able to do, you know, see large populations.
[01:25:38.290 --> 01:25:45.290]  But when you do get to see a large population, you get to see that the outlier stuff, you know, like you were talking where the jack was coming through and stuff like that.
[01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:46.290]  You know, it's.
[01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:48.290]  It's really invaluable, I think.
[01:25:49.290 --> 01:25:50.290]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:25:51.290 --> 01:25:56.290]  And, you know, that's I 100 percent of all for hunting through as many seeds as you possibly can.
[01:25:57.290 --> 01:26:03.290]  You know, if I if I had the means to pop 20,000 seeds of one strain and find that outlier, then by all means, that's what I'd be doing.
[01:26:04.290 --> 01:26:08.290]  But, you know, the reality is that that takes a lot of space, a lot of time, a lot of money.
[01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:12.290]  And there's there's not a whole lot of people privileged enough to have that opportunity.
[01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:15.290]  You know, and I am super jealous of the ones that are.
[01:26:16.290 --> 01:26:25.290]  But I can say that I definitely do my best and do my due diligence to hunt through populations and to not not run stuff that I wouldn't want to be running myself.
[01:26:26.290 --> 01:26:29.290]  And that's a big reason why I'm so adamant about testing stuff before it goes out.
[01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:34.290]  You know, most of my genetics, I typically hunt through.
[01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:38.290]  You know, I found some stuff in about 50 seeds here and there.
[01:26:39.290 --> 01:26:45.290]  But, you know, for the most part, I want to be at a bare minimum of 100 seeds, if not 200 plus is kind of my general thought process.
[01:26:46.290 --> 01:26:48.290]  I don't necessarily always flower all those out.
[01:26:49.290 --> 01:26:56.290]  I typically select stuff down to a smaller number in the veg process because I am looking for specific things in veg.
[01:26:57.290 --> 01:27:01.290]  You know, like I I don't want things that are that are long and lanky and growing certain ways.
[01:27:01.290 --> 01:27:07.290]  So I'll chop stuff out of the way early on and just get rid of things if it doesn't fit, you know, fit the needs that I'm looking for in it.
[01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:15.290]  But I you know, even in a four by four tent, you know, I went through 144 seeds in a four by four tent because that's how many fit in the tent.
[01:27:16.290 --> 01:27:26.290]  You know, so I I'll run through as many as I possibly can in whatever circumstance that I can and whittle that down in an appropriate manner into what I see as an appropriate manner.
[01:27:26.290 --> 01:27:31.290]  But I hold myself to a kind of an absurdly high expectation with most things.
[01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:35.290]  And that's kind of one of the things that I pride myself in.
[01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:40.290]  So, you know, if it's not going to make the cut, if I don't want my garden, I wouldn't be releasing it.
[01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:44.290]  Period. You know, it's just not worth it to me. There's there's so many genetics out there these days.
[01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:53.290]  You know, what's the point of releasing stuff just to water things down further and further when there's so much polyhybrid cross of this that the other, you know, it's just hype after hype.
[01:27:53.290 --> 01:27:57.290]  And it's just I'm going to do my best to not contribute to that.
[01:27:59.290 --> 01:28:04.290]  Yeah, and I actually talked to Pat about coming on and going through his lineup.
[01:28:04.290 --> 01:28:08.290]  So what what can you say about Heroes of the Farm?
[01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:12.290]  I love my boys out of Heroes, man.
[01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:20.290]  That is one facility that if the word push comes to mind, Pat doesn't slow down.
[01:28:20.290 --> 01:28:22.290]  And one of his nicknames is Project Pat.
[01:28:23.290 --> 01:28:25.290]  He's just like that dude don't slow down.
[01:28:26.290 --> 01:28:31.290]  So if you're looking for someone who's got motivation behind them, man, that that's the guy to follow.
[01:28:31.290 --> 01:28:37.290]  You know, he's he's he's a he's a difficult guy to work with sometimes.
[01:28:37.290 --> 01:28:41.290]  But a lot of us in this profession who are kind of in that role are, you know, we have high expectations.
[01:28:43.290 --> 01:28:45.290]  We come from a little bit different backgrounds.
[01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:48.290]  So things can get a little heated, a little fiery sometimes.
[01:28:50.290 --> 01:28:59.290]  So, you know, but Pat has some of the some of the most wealth of knowledge of any gardener that I that I've really ever worked with.
[01:28:59.290 --> 01:29:07.290]  You know, he he cares more than any gardener and he has some of the highest standards of any gardener from his smallest sanitizing rooms.
[01:29:08.290 --> 01:29:11.290]  You know, his level of cleaning stuff out after a run is done.
[01:29:11.290 --> 01:29:14.290]  You know, like he he takes it to that next level.
[01:29:14.290 --> 01:29:19.290]  You know, that that was the kind of stuff that that really stuck with me after the fact.
[01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:21.290]  You know, I was there for a couple of years.
[01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:29.290]  And when I left, you know, the the main reason I left is because I had kind of stepped into a role of helping them with their sales department and helping get their sales up and going.
[01:29:30.290 --> 01:29:36.290]  I have a professional background in sales and they kind of had gotten the gardens functioning to a point with the team.
[01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:40.290]  They had in place while I was doing that, that I wasn't really needed in the gardens at that point.
[01:29:40.290 --> 01:29:45.290]  And I honestly just got tired of doing sales and, you know, wanted to get back into working with the plant again.
[01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:50.290]  And so I decided to kind of take my opportunity to go off and, you know, get back into my own thing.
[01:29:50.290 --> 01:29:52.290]  And that's when I started doing my consulting business.
[01:29:53.290 --> 01:29:58.290]  But, you know, the the knowledge I gained from working with Pat and the team out there is just invaluable.
[01:29:58.290 --> 01:30:14.290]  You know, like the the infrastructure build out, you know, the large scale seed populations, the the level of quality that's expected and demanded out there, you know, and understanding, understanding level of expectation that facilities should have.
[01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:21.290]  And most facilities don't have, you know, people don't really realize what level they can push this plant to.
[01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:23.290]  And that's kind of the reality.
[01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:32.290]  And so out there, heroes, you know, we had we we made every mistake in the book, but we, you know, we tried everything that we could to improve.
[01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:39.290]  And we were willing to test and experiment with stuff to, you know, to find the best the best thing that worked for us.
[01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:43.290]  And, you know, the reality is with these big facilities, every facility is different.
[01:30:44.290 --> 01:30:47.290]  Every facility functions different and every facility is going to run differently.
[01:30:47.290 --> 01:30:53.290]  So no one system is going to work in any other place to the same degree as it does in another.
[01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:57.290]  You can do your best, but there's always going to be tweaks that need to be made.
[01:30:58.290 --> 01:31:01.290]  And without a doubt, that's one of the biggest things that I took away from my time at Heroes.
[01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:10.290]  They're they're just super stand up guys that, you know, they follow their word and they're they're just kind of the old school kind of kind of community members that you would like to have around you.
[01:31:11.290 --> 01:31:15.290]  So we have a Lichfield question.
[01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:19.290]  Yeah, Lichfield was bred outside.
[01:31:20.290 --> 01:31:22.290]  Yeah, that was bred in my backyard.
[01:31:23.290 --> 01:31:25.290]  Not this past fall, fall before.
[01:31:26.290 --> 01:31:31.800]  So yeah, I do.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:33.800]  I do do some breeding outdoors and some outdoors.
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:38.800]  It kind of depends on what season I'm in and what what I have available.
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:41.800]  So some stuff is done inside and some is done outside.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:45.800]  So have we covered Orange is the new Black Lime?
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.800]  Sure.
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:51.800]  If anybody's got any questions, you know, the big things with it are it's a fairly quick finisher.
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:53.800]  She's loud.
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:57.800]  You know, the biggest things, the orange, orange terpene profile.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:01.800]  There's some other terpene profiles as well along that Black Lime Reserve.
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.800]  Kind of some of that gassy funk comes through.
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.800]  But the orange is what I bred it for.
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:10.800]  And that's what I look for in my phenotypes when I'm hunting that one.
[01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.800]  Yeah, so decent, decent finish time.
[01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:16.800]  Not a not a horrible stretch.
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:19.800]  She has a fairly good structure to her.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:23.800]  Not the biggest healer is what I would say the biggest downfall.
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:25.800]  But a nose on her.
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.800]  She's one of the loudest ones that I've got in the garden.
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:30.800]  All right.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:35.070]  And just quickly, going back through the.
[01:32:35.070 --> 01:32:36.070]  But going back through the.
[01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:40.730]  The pictures.
[01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:48.580]  Yeah, those were grown up by my buddy Burley Burleson.
[01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:53.870]  That was my backyard.
[01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:57.870]  OK, so up next, we have.
[01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:01.870]  This is a sleeper hold.
[01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:04.870]  So this sleeper hold.
[01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:09.870]  This one was bred outdoors in my backyard.
[01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:13.870]  I got this cut of L.A. pure kush from Kevin Jodry.
[01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:15.870]  It's the one that he shared with a number of us.
[01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:18.870]  I believe he said it's his favorite medicine.
[01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:27.870]  You know, it's just like that heavy, hashy, musky, you know, like old school, you know, put you down kind of medicine.
[01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:30.870]  And I absolutely love pure kush.
[01:33:31.870 --> 01:33:32.870]  It's definitely one of my favorites, too.
[01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:38.870]  And so I crossed that with an Adam Dunn Afghan Kush male.
[01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:42.870]  So kind of the way my breeding I had.
[01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:49.870]  When I left Heroes of the Farm, I had just recently popped a bunch of seeds out there within a couple of months.
[01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:53.870]  And I was selecting a bunch of males from a bunch of different stuff that I had popped.
[01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:56.870]  So I kind of I thought I was going to be there longer term.
[01:33:57.870 --> 01:34:02.870]  And I was hunting through a bunch of seeds with the expectations of finding males that I wanted to work specifically.
[01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:12.870]  The males that I was what I was looking for with males at that point, you know, the first few crosses I made were kind of heavy in the polyhybridism.
[01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:17.870]  They were sort of just for fun and not really overly thought out per se.
[01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:24.870]  You know, like they had reason behind them, but it wasn't like, OK, I want to make some crosses based off of this, this, this kind of thing.
[01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:32.870]  And so I started hunting for all these different males with a plan of making a bunch of different crosses.
[01:34:33.870 --> 01:34:41.870]  And then I left Heroes and basically I had all these different males that I then needed to flower out to collect pollen from.
[01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:50.870]  And then since pollen only has a certain lifespan, I then had to kind of quickly do projects with a bunch of different males.
[01:34:51.870 --> 01:35:00.870]  And so I did my best to have kind of breeding chambers set up in a few different places, different rooms outside, things along those lines.
[01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:14.870]  And the reason I was hunting, the main desire I was looking for these males at that time was something that was less of a polyhybrid, closer back to its land race heritage.
[01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:27.870]  Not necessarily land race. Ideally, something that had been worked by another breeder that had been back crossed a couple of times that would be a stabilized yet closer to land race.
[01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:40.870]  That way, I'm not having to do the backbreaking work of looking through all of this land race material that, you know, let's be honest, a lot of times there's a lot of boof that you're not necessarily into growing out.
[01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:45.870]  To be able to find those gems, you know, when you find the gems, that's what's up.
[01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:51.870]  You know, like that's what you're looking for is that stuff that hasn't been crossed has, you know, less of this watered down effect to it.
[01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:59.870]  But, you know, like I said, let's be real about it. When you're hunting land race material, you know, you're going to have to hunt through pretty high populations.
[01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:03.870]  And you're going to have to have a very discerning eye when you're looking at stuff.
[01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:15.870]  And so, Adam Dunn had done some work on a couple crosses. He had an Afghan Kush male that he had selected and back crossed three times, I believe, and stabilized.
[01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:23.870]  And so that was one cross that he did. And then there was also a Burmese Kush male that he had done the same similar thing to.
[01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:26.870]  You know, these were some land race genetics that he had started with.
[01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:45.870]  And so the male that I selected, the Adam Dunn Afghan, the girls that I grew out were super stocky plants, fast flowering, you know, real tight structure to them, tight node spacing, good dense flower development.
[01:36:46.870 --> 01:37:00.870]  And they had some great noses to them. So this cross that he did was the Afghan Kush three times back cross male. And then he hit that to a King's Kush.
[01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:08.870]  The King's Kush, I believe, has a grape ogee or something along those lines in it. And so it has a little bit of a fruitiness to it.
[01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:15.870]  So there's a little bit of some grape notes of lime kind of notes that come through.
[01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:24.870]  But definitely a lot of those musky kind of fuely hash notes come from that pure Kush.
[01:37:25.870 --> 01:37:33.870]  She's going to be a quick finisher, you know, definitely for outdoors, you'll be late September, early October kind of timeframe on her.
[01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:45.870]  Indoors, she's, you know, she veges kind of slowly. So it's not necessary, you know, if you're going to be putting her into production, I'd be doing a higher plant count, possibly shorter veg time, higher plant count.
[01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:49.870]  I'm going to ask if Adam Dunn adds any size.
[01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:52.870]  In regards to the actual plant itself?
[01:37:53.870 --> 01:38:02.870]  The PK. Yeah. You know, I'm growing the PK out and working with it right now. And it's slow, you know, it's awesome, but it's slow and small.
[01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:08.870]  Yeah, no, she's the Adam Dunn Afghan definitely did not speed anything up.
[01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:15.870]  She's like I said, like definitely a fast, she's a fast finisher, slow veger.
[01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:21.870]  In a commercial setting, you know, like there's a lot of these guys, they're doing two week flips, you know, like that.
[01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:41.870]  She's the kind of thing you can clone her and flip her with tight, tight pack and get good yield out of her. Dense flowers, good size flowers, but just decked out like iced out. The fan leaves have trichomes going all the way out, petioles, like they get super frosty.
[01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:49.870]  And like bigger, bigger trichome head size. So definitely good for collection on bubble hash.
[01:38:51.870 --> 01:39:01.870]  And I, I, again, I definitely would not say that she's going to be quick or a fast veger. She doesn't stretch much at all, you know, like one and a half times kind of thing.
[01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:10.870]  Like she stays super small and just finishes quick. So I see a green type thing or outdoor, you know, outdoor she'll crush for you. She'll, she'll finish up early and just stink.
[01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:32.870]  Yeah, she, they, they definitely, those, those I hunted them the way that I, the way that I hunt a lot of times when I'm doing phenyl hunts, I'll germinate things under 1212 and I'll just let them finish. I won't bring them, I won't bring them back to veg. I'll just let them go.
[01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:47.870]  And those finished just super, super fast. And, you know, they, they finished like six, eight inches tall. They, they like, you know, they, they were basically seedlings decked out with flower, flower and trichomes.
[01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:50.870]  And so they, they're the kind of plant that
[01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:58.870]  super sturdy definitely doesn't need support very often. You know, they're, they'll hold their own weight more often than not.
[01:39:59.870 --> 01:40:12.870]  In this production setting, like the facility that I'm at right now, it's one of the strains I'm going to be suggesting for them just because of how tightly packed they put their plants and how quickly they need things to finish.
[01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:23.870]  You know, it's one of those where they're, they're pretty strict on a 56 to 59 day flower time. They don't like things going longer than that. They, they want to, they need to be harvesting on a weekly basis kind of deal.
[01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:27.870]  So by, by cramming a bunch of these drills, it's a good way to get that done.
[01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:36.870]  People always ask me, I was going to throw it out to you. Like when you say densely packed, what is that like in a four by eight to you? How many plants?
[01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:41.870]  I mean, this is probably like one plant per square foot, something along those lines.
[01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:44.870]  Perfect. Perfect.
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:55.660]  Yeah, that's kind of my idea. You know, I get at that, at that rate, you know, maybe even two per square foot in certain circumstances.
[01:40:57.660 --> 01:40:58.660]  Yeah, something along those lines.
[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:07.600]  I hear a baby.
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:12.600]  Yes, that is my baby inside and I'm not dealing with it. Lovely.
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:18.600]  She's just saying hello. She's, she's teething big time right now. So she has been tore up the past couple of nights.
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:21.600]  How old is she? Is she a year? Almost?
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.600]  No, she just hit, she just hit eight months, two days ago.
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:26.600]  Okay. Okay.
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:36.600]  Yeah. So she, she started crawling a week ago. Today she pulled herself up on her own to standing out of the blue. All of a sudden I'm sitting there looking at her on the floor and then she's standing up holding her head up.
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:44.600]  Holding onto my knee. Where the hell did you come from? So she, she's moving along quick. You know, she, she's a real joy though. She's a lot of fun.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:46.600]  It's cool, man.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:53.600]  Okay. So up next we have, and first of all, first tell me where the name came from.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.600]  That John. Yeah. So that's, that's the shout out to my years in Philadelphia.
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:08.600]  John is definitely a Philly lingo where it kind of means anything and everything. You know, that John is fire. Where's that John? Who's that John? That John's young. Kind of, kind of anything and everything.
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:16.600]  Yeah. If you, if you go into South Philly, you, you'll hear people say John all over the place. Yo, do you see that John? You watch that John?
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:27.600]  It cracks me up every time. So this one just kind of gives a shout out is that John that John was fired. So that's a GMO across with Burmese, Kush.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:33.600]  that John you watch the John last night and it just it cracks me up every time. So this one just
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:40.560]  kind of gives a shout out it's that John that John was fired. So that's GMO cross with Burmese Cush
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:49.680]  and it's same kind of thing like I was saying with Adam Dunn with his Afghan Cush three times
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:54.800]  back cross. This is his Burmese Cush which he selected a male into the back cross three times
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:43:04.480]  with and then this one was out cross to Ogre OG. And so again that's a pretty stocky plant.
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:13.440]  The male that I chose was very stocky put on big flower set had a real strong kind of
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:22.800]  sour fuel nose in my mind and I hit that to GMO. Kind of the reason I have some
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:28.640]  all of these one offs is like I was saying where I selected all these males that I was planning on
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:32.640]  doing some projects with on a larger scale where I thought I was going to have you know the space
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:37.760]  to be able to do these larger scale breeding projects. And then all of a sudden I was kind of
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:41.600]  you know shoving a bunch of males into a four by four tent to keep them in bed for a while and
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:47.200]  then testing them out individually and two by fours. I'd flower them out in a two by four tent
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:52.560]  and collect pollen off of them and you know store the pollen in the freezer kind of thing. So this
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:59.120]  is GMO cross with Burmese Kush and you know like everybody else you know GMO is super fire.
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:07.120]  I love the terpene profile on it. I love the flower structure. I love the yield. I hate how
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:14.320]  long it flowers. You know like taking flower 80 days like goodness gracious that this day and age
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:20.240]  I got that's just that's a big challenge especially for someone like me who works in the commercial
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:26.480]  setting so much. And so the Burmese you know she's a fast flower so my goal was to shorten up
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:33.040]  that shorten that up but I had all these males and I wasn't able to you know plan out larger
[01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:37.440]  projects and so it was more of like okay what's going to match up the best with this single male.
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:43.120]  So I would have kind of more specific projects and with you know like the pure Kush and Afghan Kush
[01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:48.320]  I really wanted a very fast flowering outdoor sturdy stocky kind of thing with this plant.
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:54.320]  My main goal more than anything was to shorten the time frame. Shorten the time frame on GMO you
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:45:00.320]  know like that was the main goal. So a lot of these phenotypes and there's super limited of
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:06.080]  these. I don't I think I probably gave away five packs maybe and I think I only put in stock five
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:10.800]  packs or something like that total. So whatever's out there is out there you know I kept enough for
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:20.160]  myself to hunt. I always put in stock five packs. Every time I get something I'm like okay that goes in my
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:26.800]  bag one of each you know so there's probably only two or three. Yeah so that's all there is to that girl.
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:32.640]  Definitely sped up the flowering time which is great. You know I had terpene
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:40.640]  flowers that were finishing you know it wasn't super fast but in the 65 to 75 kind of day range.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:47.120]  And in my mind you know for GMO that I'm all about that. They're they were kind of split down the
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:54.800]  middle as far as what I saw in terpene profile was something that had that serious GMO dumpster
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:46:00.480]  kind of funk to them. And then the other side of things was definitely on this like kind of
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:05.040]  Burmese side where it had more of a sour a little bit of a berry kind of fruity smell to it but not
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:08.800]  not overpowering on that side but definitely a little bit more of a fuel-y kind of thing.
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:17.120]  The thing with these is you know with GMO I myself and a number of growers that I'm
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:23.360]  good friends with have had her throw pollen sacks about right around week three.
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:28.160]  They've never had any viable pollen in them. They're always on the lower level of the plant
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:34.080]  for me. I usually just pluck them off and go about my day and I've never had any seed production.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:41.600]  The 10 girls that I flowered out of that John there was one girl that leaned the most towards
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:47.760]  the GMO who did throw some pollen sacks but again same kind of thing I removed a number of I removed
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:52.880]  them. I didn't see any viable pollen there wasn't any powder anything that came out of them and I
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:58.640]  didn't see any seed production from them. So I just like to be transparent with everybody and throw it
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:03.200]  out there when I do have experience with something throwing pollen sacks and I'll always let everybody
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:06.960]  know in advance that you know it's something to keep an eye on. But it wasn't anything that
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:13.280]  concerned me just because it was so similar to the GMO mom and the same kind of traits and
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:16.960]  characteristics that I've had to deal with her in regards to that pollen sack showing up. But
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:22.240]  I've even left a number of those pollen sacks from the GMO mom just to see if anything would
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:26.320]  seed out from it and I honestly have never had any kind of actual seed production. So
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:30.880]  you know these crazy polyhybrids you get wonky stuff like that sometimes and
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:35.440]  you know I don't know if everybody looks at her as close as I did or maybe people don't like to
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:39.520]  talk about it but some pretty big name growers that I'm friends with had had very similar
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:47.600]  circumstances with her so I wasn't too surprised by it. But she just great flower you know it
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:53.280]  definitely carries some of those garlicky oniony kind of notes but the the big benefit was it
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:57.600]  shortened up the flower time to where you're getting some of those GMO dumpster terpenes
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:04.320]  and that much you know a week to two weeks faster sometimes and that you know that was
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:11.360]  that was the main goal and so I was stoked to see that was achieved. In regards to structure it you
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:17.840]  know the the parental lineage is just they're so far from each other that it very much shows that
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:24.160]  when you're looking through the terpene profile or the the different phenotype profiles you very
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:30.960]  much have that lanky stretchy super stretchy GMO that you know you're going to get you know triple
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:36.480]  definitely triple size when you're going through stretch. But then the Burmese mom or the Burmese
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:41.120]  dad man it some of those phenotypes barely stretched at all it you know one and a half
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:46.800]  two times maximum so it definitely there's some phenotypes that definitely carry that GMO terpene
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:51.920]  profile but also have a shorter structure as well so you kind of get you know the faster flowering
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:49:01.520]  time in addition to in my mind a bit preferable of a flower structure. So it's one that I I'm
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:06.400]  really excited to hunt her further I kept a couple hundred seeds for myself that definitely won't be
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:11.360]  getting released just because of how excited I am for that that GMO terpene profile is one of my
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:17.440]  favorites so I'm pumped on that one looking forward to getting into it. I'm really excited about it
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:25.440]  too man and I've actually never got to grow any GMO myself but I've smoked some hash and some
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:31.920]  smoked some flower and I actually got some of the medellin the cookies medellin one one one
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:37.680]  and it's I haven't smoked it yet but as I'm smelling it in flower it's got that game
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:46.480]  garden rotten GMO terp and so as you're just talking through that I was like fuck I'm definitely
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:53.120]  I'm gonna pop that pack of that John that I set aside and see if I can put that on there that
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:58.720]  might be really fun. Yeah I just saw a question pop up asking what stuff I have that might be
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:06.320]  botrytis resistant kind of beneficial for outdoor. I've had good success with big schloss
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:16.720]  in regards to that. The mom to big schloss is Blue Ridge Eclipse and she puts on just big
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:21.920]  flowers you know like they can be like forearm size leg size kind of things have grown outdoors
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:28.000]  in the right settings but the the black lime reserve and this cross seems to have kind of
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:37.040]  made it a little more kind of I guess like golf ball-y if that's a term where it kind of you know
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:42.800]  like the side the the side flowers are kind of a little bit more knobby going up than the than
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:47.520]  the mom the mom the Blue Ridge Eclipse just gets these like real big colas that don't have many
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:53.760]  breaks through them but the the big schloss does a good job outdoors a fairly decent finish time
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:51:02.320]  you'll have some stuff late September early October but she's again big terpene profile but
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:08.080]  I would say probably one of the better ones I have regarding botrytis resistance.
[01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:24.650]  Okay so up next the trailblazer. Yeah this was another one kind of a one-off thing
[01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:31.610]  so this dude Joshua Stroud with Conscious Cultivators in Oregon I think he lived in
[01:51:31.610 --> 01:51:37.530]  the Emerald Triangle for a while he's been breeding for 20 plus years and really works his lines
[01:51:39.050 --> 01:51:42.890]  to a much farther level than a lot of people you know he's a bit more of that old school breeder
[01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:50.810]  type who you know furthers lineages he's not about the the quick super fast polyhybrid pump
[01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:57.050]  out a bunch of stuff kind of gear he definitely takes stuff into further F generation to really
[01:51:57.050 --> 01:52:03.210]  stabilize stuff and so he was nice enough to share some pollen with me of this lemon diesel
[01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:10.490]  male that he had created so it's lemon og crossed with the our lemon diesel crossed with a
[01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:16.810]  bizarre male that he had and he I think he back crossed out a couple of times to stabilize some
[01:52:16.810 --> 01:52:22.970]  stuff in it and kind of get it into a good place for him and I pollinated a cut of
[01:52:24.730 --> 01:52:30.730]  Mount Hood Magic the Durban Poison Leaner and that was the only cross I did with that male
[01:52:31.690 --> 01:52:40.090]  and I love that Mount Hood Magic Durban I'm less of a fan of the Northern Lights one but the
[01:52:40.090 --> 01:52:47.930]  the Durban Pheno I'm a big fan of that plant but she can be a real stretchy girl and can go a
[01:52:47.930 --> 01:52:53.770]  little bit longer and so this lemon diesel the bizarre the hope was that it would kind of the
[01:52:53.770 --> 01:52:59.610]  bizarre would bring in some stockier traits and kind of reduce some of that stretch and you know
[01:52:59.610 --> 01:53:04.490]  of course of course there's percentage of the phenotypes that are stretchier without a doubt
[01:53:04.490 --> 01:53:08.810]  but there definitely is some that got shortened up by that that you know I was a big gold mine
[01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:16.090]  with that cross but she she gets super frosty just like one of those it just has that silver sheen
[01:53:16.090 --> 01:53:21.530]  kind of covering the whole plant where you know just has that super silver look kind of like gg4
[01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:27.610]  carry a lot of times or it's just like a very silver looking plant she
[01:53:29.770 --> 01:53:36.970]  she puts on good size flowers those pictures I think are somewhere around week six or so
[01:53:36.970 --> 01:53:43.290]  something along those lines so they still got a few weeks left left to go time to put some weight
[01:53:43.290 --> 01:53:52.250]  on with them and they she she does pretty well outside I was kind of surprised I thought I thought
[01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:58.650]  maybe with the the lemon genetics and that you know the the mountainhood magic side of things
[01:53:58.650 --> 01:54:03.690]  can go a little bit longer but I had some friends grow her outdoor this season and you know they
[01:54:03.690 --> 01:54:08.330]  pulled her down and had some good success with her the terpene profiles kind of there are definitely
[01:54:08.330 --> 01:54:12.410]  some limiting notes that come through I've heard people say kind of a lemon zinger kind of thing
[01:54:13.530 --> 01:54:20.090]  I think it's in my mind it's not like a very fresh pungent kind of lemon and I kind of see
[01:54:20.090 --> 01:54:24.410]  it lingering in the background a little bit the the Durban terpene profile definitely carries
[01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:29.850]  through pretty heavy so I kind of feel like with the Durban and lemony type nose kind of has almost
[01:54:29.850 --> 01:54:37.770]  a haze effect to it but she's she's a real nice plant just like super decked out I think that's
[01:54:37.770 --> 01:54:42.170]  kind of the biggest thing to take away from her is the resin content on the flower it's uh
[01:54:43.050 --> 01:54:52.730]  it's it's real greasy um and definitely uh definitely gets like very heavy trichome content
[01:54:52.730 --> 01:55:00.170]  going going out the leaves um yeah she uh I haven't grown a whole lot of her I I grew out
[01:55:00.410 --> 01:55:09.450]  um a number of phenotypes of her um about a year ago I'd say and the the way just germinating seeds
[01:55:09.450 --> 01:55:14.170]  straight in the soil and letting them finish under 12 12 giving them no veg at all and they
[01:55:14.170 --> 01:55:19.610]  they all finished about a probably almost two feet tall I was kind of surprised um how how far
[01:55:19.610 --> 01:55:24.010]  they stretched but that's what these pictures are from from that seed run where it was literally
[01:55:24.010 --> 01:55:29.930]  just starting them uh direct to soil under 12 12 and uh just letting them run their way out and it
[01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:36.170]  was all that was all top dressing I believe uh for nutrient after the amended soil on them um they
[01:55:38.250 --> 01:55:42.010]  they're one that I look forward to digging into because a very good daytime high
[01:55:42.010 --> 01:55:49.450]  is probably my most sativa opportunity um in regards to my strains uh I had back surgery
[01:55:49.450 --> 01:55:55.530]  about a decade ago so a lot of stuff that I breed I definitely tend to go on the heavier side um
[01:55:55.530 --> 01:55:59.690]  just to help me with pain relief and you know I like to be able to help others with pain relief
[01:56:00.490 --> 01:56:06.490]  all the stuff I've had to go through on my own um and so I I would say that she she's a nice one to
[01:56:06.490 --> 01:56:10.970]  have added into my repertoire just because she is more along that sativa side of things and does have
[01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:16.410]  a a bit better of a daytime high and so I'm I'm looking forward to to working her further to be
[01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:20.730]  able to have a little bit more of that daytime kind of smoke available because there's that kind
[01:56:20.730 --> 01:56:25.050]  of things going by the wayside you know with all these production schedules you know it's such a
[01:56:25.050 --> 01:56:30.170]  quick turnaround for these people that it's just uh getting harder and harder to incorporate the
[01:56:30.170 --> 01:56:35.450]  daytime kind of smoke so that that's part of my goal on her was to be able to try and get a shorter
[01:56:35.450 --> 01:56:40.890]  flower time and they carry some of those daytime terpene profiles that can carry us through and
[01:56:40.890 --> 01:56:50.170]  keep us motivated so that's the that's the basic gist on trailblazer got it we had a uh question
[01:56:50.170 --> 01:56:57.450]  about uh what what's the longest flowering strain and maybe the opposite what's the shortest what's
[01:56:57.450 --> 01:57:01.770]  the quickest for I mean the the north the person who asked the question about being up in Maine
[01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:11.050]  yep yeah um I would say honestly the GMO the GMO the that john cross is probably the longest
[01:57:11.930 --> 01:57:19.130]  um the longest flowering cross I would say it's kind of I mean I guess it's kind of tough to say
[01:57:19.130 --> 01:57:22.170]  that just because with that one you know you're going to have phenotypes that are going to be a
[01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:27.530]  lot shorter but there are definitely phenotypes that are going to go mid-upper 70s um the orange
[01:57:27.530 --> 01:57:30.970]  is a new black line definitely shortens up the east coast sour diesel a little bit so I don't
[01:57:30.970 --> 01:57:36.970]  think you're going to have much going over days 70 72 with that cross with the lichfield um so I
[01:57:36.970 --> 01:57:43.290]  I really think that um I think that that one is probably going to be in the early 70s range on
[01:57:43.290 --> 01:57:49.610]  the longer side but some stuff in the 60 63 to 65 day range the the GMO cross is going to have some
[01:57:49.610 --> 01:57:56.810]  of that longer stuff um and then also the the mountainhood magic cross the trailblazer is going
[01:57:56.810 --> 01:58:02.890]  to kind of have some of those longer flowering times as well um shortest flowering times are
[01:58:02.890 --> 01:58:08.490]  definitely going to be uh that sleeper hold is without a doubt going to be the fastest
[01:58:09.210 --> 01:58:14.010]  um followed by big schloss those are going to be the two faster ones I don't I don't know if we
[01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:20.010]  have blue ridge eclipses in stock still um if there is blue ridge eclipse no okay if there if
[01:58:20.010 --> 01:58:24.650]  there is any of that it's that's the mom of big schloss and it's definitely super fast flowering
[01:58:24.650 --> 01:58:51.030]  as well uh yeah that's kind of the roundup of them any questions uh no all the stuff that I've read
[01:58:51.030 --> 01:59:01.830]  outdoors most all of it's been grown um I do my best to get stuff tested indoors and outdoors um
[01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:09.430]  lichfield right now I I have had I haven't had her tested full outdoors I've had her tested in
[01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:16.310]  greenhouse uh and right now she's in testing and indoors I think at about week five or six
[01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:22.390]  and indoors um yeah I do my best to try and get stuff tested in both environments if I can
[01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:28.950]  uh it kind of depends on the general time frame of things and how quickly um stuff is going to
[01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:36.870]  get put out put out to sale um you know if it if it's October and I'm trying to get a lineup out
[01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:41.750]  then it obviously it's only going to get tested in indoor circumstances or greenhouse circumstances
[01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:46.070]  but I do my best to try and pass stuff around to as wide a variety as possible and I like to
[01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:57.790]  see how stuff handles in all circumstances um go ahead Peter I know I was just gonna say we we
[01:59:57.790 --> 02:00:03.790]  went through the whole lineup of uh what we have available so yeah I was gonna say can you give us
[02:00:03.790 --> 02:00:10.270]  a rundown of what's available and then after that maybe Avery can tell us what he's working on
[02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:14.830]  now or what's I guess what's being tested right now that we can expect to be released
[02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:25.290]  to released when it's uh when you're ready yeah um yeah go ahead Peter orange is the new black
[02:00:25.290 --> 02:00:32.570]  lime is now out of stock that is done there's no more of that yeah and sorry to be so like the
[02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:37.530]  salesman about this guys I mean I'm just uh you just want to I think this stuff is really good
[02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:42.490]  and it's it's gonna go and so I just want everyone to know that it cares and wants it if you do
[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:54.180]  Josh I think you just muted yourself oops sorry you muted yourself mid-thought
[02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:02.500]  go ahead I'll let you go ahead and read off so for me I I think the idea here is you know we
[02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:08.420]  want to feature kind of small craft breeders who are doing you know what we consider to be great
[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:19.940]  work um and so this is yet another example and uh you know Tyler from uh Family Tree was on last
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:27.700]  week and we got Seattle Chronic coming up I know Brandon Rust um talking to him about coming on um
[02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:36.020]  Sunday we're with Pacific Northwest Roots oh right that's Sunday Sunday what time
[02:01:36.740 --> 02:01:42.660]  uh instead of time in the morning was the thought morning yeah I know I like that that's uh so it's
[02:01:42.660 --> 02:01:49.540]  funny because like tonight uh Mia wanted to go live and I was just gonna pull random people on
[02:01:49.540 --> 02:01:53.940]  and you know I have no idea which direction we go in but then my five-year-old wants to
[02:01:54.820 --> 02:02:04.180]  stay with me tonight uh so we'll see what happens but um yeah I think the idea here is you know
[02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:12.420]  you're supporting small craft breeders who are doing cool work and unique stuff and you know
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:21.060]  they each have kind of their their like focus their intent what they're kind of trying to do
[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:25.700]  and achieve and a lot of it like I I love when people just kind of you know they don't breed for
[02:02:26.580 --> 02:02:30.900]  you know what's currently hot in the market but they breed for what they believe in you know it's
[02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:38.580]  like a musician that you know makes music based on what they like yeah purple punch will not be
[02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:48.420]  top 40 right not what's in the top 40 uh you know or trending uh like musically so yeah I definitely
[02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:54.340]  do my best to you know not that not that I have a problem with any of the high polyhybrid strains
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:58.740]  that are out there these days but I I think Josh and I have talked about this a number of times
[02:02:58.740 --> 02:03:04.340]  where we um we don't necessarily feel that we get the same effect from a lot of these polyhybrids
[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:08.500]  as we did from some of these older school strains that have been maintained over the years that
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:14.740]  maybe haven't been watered down by genetics over time um and so that you know that that's kind of
[02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:20.340]  always an intention of mine is to kind of work with some of the gear that is um you know a little
[02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:26.340]  bit more older and a little bit less crossed out some of the things that I have going on so the
[02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:32.420]  crosses I did right before I left Oregon um I selected one of the things I did at Heroes of the
[02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:38.980]  Farms I selected a uh landrace lowland afghan f2 so obviously it's not landrace I just put that in
[02:03:38.980 --> 02:03:44.180]  there to kind of give people uh kind of a an understanding of where it was but it was this
[02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:52.660]  guy goes by nugglab um and so he got a bunch of landrace afghan lowland afghan seeds um and hunted
[02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:59.140]  through a bunch of them and found some uh a stable male and female out of a big messy pile of
[02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:06.260]  landrace stuff and bred those and tested a bunch of them and you know had had good success um with
[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:13.220]  the with the offspring from them um and so I got I got a number of packs from him I think I popped
[02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:18.100]  like 50 seeds of that or something but in my mind all the males really stood out to me they they
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:23.940]  just looked like you know they had nice big fan leaves and real good structure on them um so I
[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:29.140]  selected one of those when I was out of Heroes right before leaving and this was the last pollen
[02:04:29.140 --> 02:04:36.580]  that I had in the freezer um and I I crossed it with uh UK cheese the summer before and you know
[02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:43.380]  I got a ton of seeds on that plant just incredible how vigorous the pollen was um and then put the
[02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:47.780]  pollen away into storage again and it was in storage for another full year so it was almost
[02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:52.340]  a year and a half that that pollen was in storage total something along those lines and so I wasn't
[02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:56.660]  entirely sure how good it was going to do but I you know I kind of had to try and so I pollinated
[02:04:57.220 --> 02:05:02.740]  um I think nine or ten moms they were east coast sour diesel I pollinated that again so
[02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:10.180]  uh east coast sour Pakistani schittchel kush 707 headband that headband that I used for tibet knob
[02:05:10.180 --> 02:05:18.500]  I pollinated that again um pollinated Romulan Roberts Creek Congo OG Kush Banana OG and then
[02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:22.900]  from Heroes of the Farm there and One Eye Genetics their Scooby Snacks Pat was kind enough to share
[02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:29.860]  Scooby Snacks with me um and so I pollinated all those with this Afghan Kush pollen again after it
[02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:34.900]  had been in storage for a year and a half or however long it was and man I it was the the
[02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:40.100]  highest pollination rate that I've had of any of any of the males that I've used before and just
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:46.260]  absolutely all of these seeds all these plants were just loaded to the brim with seeds like
[02:05:46.260 --> 02:05:49.620]  an incredible amount of them um and so those are you know like
[02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:56.980]  that's more of the direction that I'm going from now on with my breeding you know I I've at this
[02:05:56.980 --> 02:06:02.020]  point I've made 30 something crosses and my goal at this point is to start working within all of my
[02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:06.500]  own lineages and my own crosses so you know of course when something else comes in that's just
[02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:11.460]  super fiery you know something that's really nice that I have access to then you know like absolutely
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:15.620]  I'll work it in but right now you know I I've made a lot of crosses out of a lot of the old
[02:06:15.620 --> 02:06:21.300]  school genetics that you know that I grew up on that I you know I want to continue being able to
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:25.780]  smoke but being able to give them a little bit of a twist you know and kind of like I said uh
[02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:30.420]  with these go sour give them a little bit of that that boost from from the crossing process
[02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:35.940]  um and so now you know I'll be able to go through all these things and find the interesting terpene
[02:06:35.940 --> 02:06:39.860]  profiles that I'm looking for you know a lot of these polyhybrids that are out there these days
[02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:45.300]  that they're all based off of these genetics back in the day like all these crosses started somewhere
[02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:50.020]  else so all these terpene profiles are available within within all this gear so I've you know I
[02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:53.860]  figure at this point I might as well be digging into my own stuff and looking for those smells
[02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:58.660]  and you know that's where I go for you know I'm not on this about the hype train I don't care about
[02:06:58.660 --> 02:07:04.180]  getting a name I I love cannabis and I'm gonna do my best to grow the loudest stinkiest most foul
[02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:10.740]  flower that I can um you know that that's what keeps me happy yeah right so that everybody
[02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:16.100]  supports that goal yeah so that that's my whole intention you know I I'm not here to play the game
[02:07:16.100 --> 02:07:21.780]  I you know I instagram is what it is I go on there to show people what I do um show them the flower
[02:07:21.780 --> 02:07:26.100]  that I grow and you know kind of show them the life that I live but you know that's pretty much
[02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:30.180]  it for me I'm not going to be the guy on there arguing with somebody over whatever the fuck
[02:07:30.180 --> 02:07:34.740]  people are arguing over I I couldn't care less I've got plenty of life to live over here I'm
[02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:42.180]  occupied being happy so just quickly on a random point before I lose it Greg we're making more uh
[02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:47.780]  James is going to make some more hats uh and I think the green one was either I think that was
[02:07:47.780 --> 02:07:59.740]  the Oakland A's uh colors but anyway yeah I'll take a loud boys hat I think other people agree
[02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:05.340]  with your uh yeah I mean that's what it's all about though right you know like the whole the
[02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:12.220]  whole honorage effects of cannabis you know like sure THC 28% yay if it doesn't have the terpenes
[02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:16.380]  to back it then you're not going to get the same effects out of it just the same you know like
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:20.780]  that's what it's all about you got to have a wide variety of stuff within your flower to be able to
[02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:28.140]  get you to the point you want to get yeah man I think um it's interesting like the the there's
[02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:33.100]  we've talked about this a little bit the profile that is is like therapeutic look at my dirty hands
[02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:41.580]  farming bro the profile that's therapeutic and cuts pain you know you we both have back issues
[02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:48.060]  it is the same and transcends uh this indica sativa or morpho morphologic
[02:08:51.020 --> 02:08:57.020]  you know the gmo long flowering type deal but it still has that that profile that like hits the
[02:08:57.020 --> 02:09:01.420]  fucking spot you know I'm just yeah you know that's what it's all about it's all about the
[02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:06.700]  terpene profiles that's that's what that's what has the action what guides the flower to do what
[02:09:06.700 --> 02:09:11.100]  it's going to do to you you know that that's where your body really really takes the effects from
[02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:15.740]  you know THC is great great pain reliever great psychoactive all that good stuff but
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:19.100]  those cannabinoids are what's really coming together to really push you in the direction
[02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:25.020]  whether it's giggly or sleepy or dumb or you know whatever it may be uh those terpenes are the
[02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:28.860]  they're the guiding force to that so that's what that's what we're going for and that's what we're
[02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:35.340]  hunting for have you messed with dog walker much much yeah you mentioned one eye I've grown it a
[02:09:35.340 --> 02:09:41.020]  ton out of heroes I didn't do any breeding with it at all um I respect the hell out of one eye
[02:09:41.020 --> 02:09:47.180]  that dude you know he's put out some of the loudest gear out there um you gotta get on here
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:57.420]  I have suspicion that he he might be the that turned me on to um uh fuck my brain just
[02:09:57.740 --> 02:10:02.860]  bled out the uh the living soil book that uh dude put on on that we all read
[02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:12.780]  lone fells tv with microbes with microbes yeah he too he put me on microbes back in the day
[02:10:13.420 --> 02:10:17.260]  which opened my whole thing like I saw Elaine Ingham in there I'm pretty sure it was him at
[02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:24.460]  Ruth's Garden Supply okay I'm tripping out right now because I just went to his Instagram and he
[02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:29.580]  has a link to a future cannabis project an article we did on the phylos fallout
[02:10:30.860 --> 02:10:39.660]  yeah uh anyway keep going yeah Richard is super good dude um yeah I've grown I've grown dog walker
[02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:43.180]  you know out of heroes it was a staple strain out there for a while I was out there
[02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:50.780]  just super gas you know and it throws down puts big old flowers on um his scooby snacks that's
[02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:55.580]  that's the one for me that's like you know that that's my everyday smoke I can smoke scooby snacks
[02:10:56.220 --> 02:11:01.580]  all day every day um it like literally the two and a half years that I worked there I
[02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:05.260]  smoked it every single day and I didn't once get sick of smoking it like it's
[02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:09.740]  just that kind of flower and it has sort of a similar kind of funk to it as GMO does
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:16.140]  um but it's dog walker girl scout cookie is the you know the the background on the scooby snacks
[02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:23.500]  it uh they pat and rich were they're they're good friends and that you know that's how pat ended up
[02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:28.620]  with dog walker with the scooby snacks out there is by by rich setting him up with those cuts and
[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:35.100]  um you know when I was getting ready to do this this cross the afghan cross I you know I just
[02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:38.860]  kept on going back through my head over and over again how much I love that scooby snacks and I
[02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:44.700]  just couldn't couldn't resist but to reach out and beg a little bit they both were kind enough
[02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:49.580]  you know like to let me have the cut and to let me do some work with it so I you know I split the
[02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:54.860]  seeds up a third between me rich and pat so each one of us has got a big old bag of seeds to be
[02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:59.100]  able to hunt through on that one and that it's one of the ones I'm I'm most excited about that
[02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:07.100]  that afghan male so I I crossed uh UK cheese with that same male a year ago and I I despise the way
[02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:12.460]  UK cheese grows I can't stand it I love the flower you know kind of that like like cheese Danish kind
[02:12:12.460 --> 02:12:20.220]  of smell to it um but it it's just super super thin super floppy just like not a fun plant to
[02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:26.140]  grow tons of secondary branching and so I hit it with that Afghan male and it it stirred her up big
[02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:31.260]  time but a lot of those same profiles come through and so I'm I'm really excited to have done the
[02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:36.940]  rest of these crosses now because I I was able to see what that male did to the cheese and so now I
[02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:42.060]  at least have an idea of what it's going to do to these other crosses as well so those are most
[02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:47.020]  likely a lot of my future stuff is going to come out of this Afghan line um you know the the OG
[02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:51.980]  Kush cross and the Scooby cross specifically I'm probably going to dig I didn't I didn't actually
[02:12:51.980 --> 02:13:00.060]  didn't know what he was yeah so there's I didn't know what there's two scoobies
[02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:08.860]  the one-eye scooby snack and the the archive scooby snack it I think it's a Girl Scout
[02:13:08.860 --> 02:13:14.940]  cookie cross with his face off OG that he crossed everything with um and it it's just not my it's not
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:20.140]  my preference by any means the the one-eye scooby snacks is like it's in a league of its own it
[02:13:20.140 --> 02:13:25.500]  it puts it puts the archive one to shame and not that there was like a competition between the two
[02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:29.980]  of them or anything but man anything the dog walker gets touched to is going to be fucking
[02:13:29.980 --> 02:13:35.180]  bow down holy grail like I it's my holy shit weed you know and has been for a couple years
[02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:42.780]  yep so you know I can imagine touching it with the GMO how that would cool go you know yeah
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:50.460]  yeah oh the other thing the other crosses that I had um that I did so I selected a
[02:13:50.460 --> 02:13:56.620]  tibet knob male when I did that the tibet knob selection for the f2 um and so I made tibet knob
[02:13:56.620 --> 02:14:04.140]  f2 and then for some other gassy stuff I hit ghost og and I hit chem 91 um and I also hit a cherry pie
[02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:08.940]  so those were the only tibet knob ghost cherry and chem those only four that I did
[02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:15.420]  with that tibet knob male um and I'm expecting those are just going to be super gas you know I
[02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:22.540]  got that's what it's all about on those the the ghost you know I ghost og I'm calling arson og
[02:14:22.540 --> 02:14:27.660]  and the chem 91 is free gasoline fight accident so give a shout out to zoolander on that one
[02:14:29.260 --> 02:14:33.180]  so those those are the two main projects that I got coming down the line that I've
[02:14:33.260 --> 02:14:38.060]  sent some stuff out to get a bunch of stuff tested uh by some by some buddies of mine so
[02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:46.060]  lots of fun stuff coming um might be a few months to a half a year or something like that but
[02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:48.300]  there'll be some goods in the coming down the line soon
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:51.980]  I wish we were neighbors dude
