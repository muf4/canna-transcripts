[00:00.830 --> 00:06.750]  All right here we go and we are live so I just discovered that the Celtics are
[00:06.750 --> 00:12.050]  playing right now so I had to quickly run and hit the record button so you're
[00:12.050 --> 00:16.190]  pulling me away from the Celtics game on a on a Mother's Day Sunday happy
[00:16.190 --> 00:23.670]  Mother's Day to all the ladies and moms out there my wife my mother my sister my
[00:23.670 --> 00:29.150]  sister my two sister-in-laws and James I'm sure I'm your side you got a lot of
[00:29.150 --> 00:35.670]  moms mothers mother-in-laws all that good stuff yeah so someone asked someone
[00:35.670 --> 00:43.710]  said we better be talking all about mother plants and then I was like no
[00:43.710 --> 00:47.910]  today's topic is actually we're gonna talk about Peter since he's a mother
[00:47.910 --> 00:54.950]  effort no so yeah I mean I thought I thought it would be great to have a show
[00:54.950 --> 00:59.130]  that we kind of talked about Peter you talk about you know you you bring
[00:59.130 --> 01:04.250]  so many people into the future cannabis project and have this great platform for
[01:04.250 --> 01:08.290]  people like myself I thought it'd be great to show kind of about your history
[01:08.290 --> 01:12.330]  yeah it doesn't have to be a long show we're gonna keep it interesting and to
[01:12.330 --> 01:15.330]  the point and then we'll discuss you know the future of the James Loud show
[01:15.330 --> 01:19.450]  we're gonna be working on a different style platform but it's gonna be a lot
[01:19.450 --> 01:24.690]  of fun Peter and I got a lot of surprises for you so I guess let's start
[01:24.690 --> 01:31.850]  talking about Peter so when you called me like half an hour ago to tell me that
[01:31.850 --> 01:38.690]  we're talking about me I was expecting like a nice relaxing Sunday but anyway
[01:38.690 --> 01:43.170]  all right let's go for it yeah so Peter tell me a little bit about
[01:43.170 --> 01:47.330]  yourself and your history with cannabis I guess I can start out talking about
[01:47.330 --> 01:52.810]  our our history together so Peter was working with Bavita when we met
[01:52.810 --> 01:58.330]  originally doing interviews and they were spot yeah I was it was always
[01:58.330 --> 02:04.050]  future cannabis project but uh yeah they that was in Vegas right that was in this
[02:04.050 --> 02:09.530]  talk to Lance when he was working with Bavita in Spain at the best interview I
[02:09.530 --> 02:13.010]  was micro dosing on my it was more of a mic more than a micro dust but one of
[02:13.010 --> 02:17.930]  the best interviews of my life on mushrooms and then the video and find
[02:17.930 --> 02:23.090]  the audio was fucked up and so and then I met you I guess we did a video in
[02:23.090 --> 02:26.690]  Vegas together that was our first and so that was future cannabis project
[02:26.690 --> 02:35.570]  originally right yeah and now let yeah Lance had always been a supporter and we
[02:35.570 --> 02:40.250]  need to macro dose again and recreate that amazing interview yeah that was
[02:40.250 --> 02:45.810]  wild it was literally I got sucked into an interview and I was on mushrooms and
[02:45.810 --> 02:49.250]  I decided to go ahead and go with the interview and it ended up being one of
[02:49.250 --> 02:53.730]  the best interviews in my life and then the audio was fucked up so it's got I
[02:53.730 --> 02:56.970]  mean Lance like gave me a high-five and a hug afterwards and like that was one
[02:56.970 --> 03:03.170]  of the best interviews I've done and sure enough no audio so yeah so tell us
[03:03.170 --> 03:06.610]  a little bit about the future cannabis project and how that got started how you
[03:06.610 --> 03:10.650]  got into cannabis actually let's go let's go how long you've been smoking
[03:10.650 --> 03:22.530]  for I'm the youngest of four so I think I first found weed in my brother my
[03:22.530 --> 03:28.770]  brother we shared a bedroom when I was little and he had like a false drawer or
[03:28.770 --> 03:34.290]  not not a false drawer a false like shelf like where you could pull it out
[03:34.290 --> 03:40.050]  and there was like a you know a square box area underneath and that's where he
[03:40.050 --> 03:47.690]  kept his weed and so yeah I don't know maybe I was eight ish cuz he he he did
[03:47.690 --> 03:54.730]  everything young I mean he was doing LSD and junior high and mushrooms and ecstasy
[03:54.730 --> 04:04.770]  and weed and other stuff and so yeah that was kind of my first and I would
[04:04.770 --> 04:08.330]  just do it by like you know cuz I didn't want him finding out that I was trying I
[04:08.330 --> 04:12.770]  don't think he would have been like yeah come smoke weed with me so like in
[04:12.770 --> 04:18.530]  our bedroom I just opened the window and and try it and it was all the weed we
[04:18.530 --> 04:26.610]  grew up on brick weed and yeah that was my intro and yeah basically smoked all
[04:26.610 --> 04:34.770]  through high school and then in college everyone smoked and I'm kind of like I
[04:34.930 --> 04:44.130]  I can't not be logical about things so you know for me in college like it was
[04:44.130 --> 04:48.690]  like we're all buying weed from random people none of us know why don't I just
[04:48.690 --> 04:55.010]  buy the weed in bulk and you know sell it for less than every all my friends
[04:55.010 --> 05:00.010]  would pay the random dude they pay and everybody wins like I make money I get
[05:00.010 --> 05:07.610]  to smoke for free my friends get to smoke good weed for cheaper than you
[05:07.610 --> 05:14.690]  know you go it was free right basically for me totally and then it was branching
[05:14.690 --> 05:20.050]  out into having variety so it was like picking up pounds of mushrooms and so my
[05:20.050 --> 05:27.050]  my I went to Brown and my best friend from high school went to Williams so one
[05:27.050 --> 05:34.690]  in Providence one in Western Mass and we used to go into Boston together you
[05:34.690 --> 05:40.050]  know every couple weeks and meet up and we'd buy together so we could get kind
[05:40.050 --> 05:46.210]  of more bulk and more discount pricing and then that moved on to you know so
[05:46.210 --> 05:52.250]  that's kind of when I first saw stuff from the West Coast so that was probably
[05:52.330 --> 05:58.770]  like 95 ish and you know the first time you see I remember like this guy Ronnie
[05:58.770 --> 06:06.770]  who was one of the guys we bought from pulled out just like a big Cola and you
[06:06.770 --> 06:12.650]  know it was probably like that long and beautiful and and I was like this things
[06:12.650 --> 06:15.770]  and I had no idea what any of it was I mean I you know it's like there was
[06:15.770 --> 06:21.490]  definitely like the stuff coming from BC and NorCal and things like Northern
[06:21.530 --> 06:31.130]  Lights and I remember G13 but I don't really remember like name names being
[06:31.130 --> 06:35.930]  thrown around or anything so it's just kind of like it was good weed and we all
[06:35.930 --> 06:41.690]  appreciated it and it was the shit that always made me giggle which I loved and
[06:41.690 --> 06:47.410]  kind of which I miss now because I don't really find stuff that makes me you know
[06:47.410 --> 06:52.810]  I don't know if other people have this too but it's like the way I felt when I
[06:52.810 --> 07:00.610]  smoked weed in college was just like you know eating enemies donut holes like
[07:00.610 --> 07:07.730]  stuffing my face and just laughing and having the best time then after college
[07:07.730 --> 07:12.330]  I went through probably like a four year five year period of just being paranoid
[07:12.330 --> 07:18.970]  every time I smoked so like I went from loving being social and around other
[07:18.970 --> 07:22.850]  people to the other extreme which was like I was living in New York and you're
[07:22.850 --> 07:29.930]  suddenly at a club or a bar and you're just like I don't want to be here and
[07:29.930 --> 07:36.290]  so but then so you were like a burnout for a few years it sounds like you
[07:36.290 --> 07:41.090]  didn't want to smoke or you did smoke didn't like it but still smoked I would
[07:41.410 --> 07:46.970]  I'd smoke at home by myself but not outside you didn't like yeah well I mean
[07:46.970 --> 07:51.770]  with the legalities of it yeah it wasn't about like yeah I mean it was like just
[07:51.770 --> 07:58.250]  going out like smoking a bowl and then going to a bar yeah was like suddenly
[07:58.250 --> 08:04.010]  not fun hmm it'd be like if you were on ecstasy and you're all like not wanting
[08:04.010 --> 08:09.890]  to be social you just be like ah like I used to love going you know taking this
[08:09.890 --> 08:16.130]  and just going and chatting people up but uh yeah it's funny I have a lot of
[08:16.130 --> 08:21.450]  friends that that were burn like they got anxiety and paranoia it's smoked all
[08:21.450 --> 08:24.930]  through high school college and then all of a sudden their 20s they became
[08:24.930 --> 08:29.010]  burnouts like they literally quit smoking weed because it gave him anxiety
[08:29.010 --> 08:32.330]  and couldn't go back to it well it's weird because I mean I have no I like
[08:32.330 --> 08:38.810]  it's like I'm not the I mean I'm hearing from you all these other people but like
[08:38.850 --> 08:45.330]  do you attribute that to something you know growing up maybe and and
[08:45.330 --> 08:49.970]  responsibilities I don't know it's you know I it's it's one of those difficult
[08:49.970 --> 08:55.570]  things everything is so individual with cannabis I think cannabis reacts
[08:55.570 --> 09:00.610]  differently in everybody's body we all have different body chemistry so what it
[09:00.610 --> 09:05.890]  does to me may be different than what it does to you and some people they start
[09:05.890 --> 09:09.770]  getting responsibility and they think the marijuana is bad and it gives them
[09:09.770 --> 09:13.490]  anxiety when it could be the specific type of cannabis there's all kinds of
[09:13.490 --> 09:17.410]  things that could be attributed to I think but but but do you think do you
[09:17.410 --> 09:22.450]  think in like I guess my question is more like in the late 90s early 2000s do
[09:22.450 --> 09:25.850]  you think the weed coming into the market started to become different where
[09:25.850 --> 09:30.810]  like that stuff had a paranoia effect versus the like like I think we all
[09:30.810 --> 09:34.490]  chase that stuff from when we're younger and that's what I chase personally is
[09:34.490 --> 09:40.370]  like just giggly and laughing well the Mexican stuff was kind of anxiety weed
[09:40.370 --> 09:44.370]  if I if I remember right you know the stuff that we had that we had to pull
[09:44.370 --> 09:48.770]  all the seeds out it was like a brown who didn't even have any green in it was
[09:48.770 --> 09:53.250]  straight brown brick weed that had seeds that stuff will give me anxiety and a
[09:53.250 --> 09:59.370]  hangover you know but I think so what I can tell you about the 90s even in
[09:59.370 --> 10:04.330]  California is that we were getting seeds over from Amsterdam and Europe and
[10:04.410 --> 10:09.890]  a lot of those were sativa dominant you know the equatorial tropical varieties
[10:09.890 --> 10:14.050]  that had those Colombian especially like the Colombian terpenes where I feel like
[10:14.050 --> 10:19.170]  that stuff would give you anxiety so it could be specific to the but you know
[10:19.170 --> 10:22.610]  California we had everything but that stuff was coming into the market we were
[10:22.610 --> 10:27.410]  seeing it in Oakland and you know there was a whole bunch of stuff but it's so
[10:27.410 --> 10:31.210]  individual who you got it from too so because I mean if you're going to Mendo
[10:31.210 --> 10:35.970]  or humble you're getting the Mendo humble varieties you know right so and
[10:35.970 --> 10:41.370]  then Canada had all kinds of shit coming down out of Canada that was you know
[10:41.370 --> 10:46.690]  good bad and ugly we had it all coming down so but that was the Canadian the
[10:46.690 --> 10:52.650]  Beasters Beasters era was like the late late 90s I have readers Steve's voice in
[10:52.650 --> 10:57.970]  my head right now which is probably one of the most epic voices ever I love
[10:58.390 --> 11:23.410]  to appreciate all listening to his voice
[11:23.410 --> 11:31.010]  Yeah when I when I got out of college I started a software company in New York and
[11:32.210 --> 11:37.150]  Nice, we did that and then I had a media kind of like an agency
[11:38.090 --> 11:41.770]  Media company that's kind of where I started doing a lot of the video stuff. So
[11:46.070 --> 11:51.210]  Like I when Adobe I don't know how techie you are but like when Adobe first
[11:51.610 --> 11:53.950]  Came out with like the flash media server
[11:54.750 --> 11:56.750]  They would give us
[11:58.210 --> 12:04.190]  Free licenses to basically build out kind of cool video like live video
[12:04.850 --> 12:08.050]  platforms on top of the media server and
[12:09.050 --> 12:12.090]  So I was playing I was doing shows like this in
[12:14.650 --> 12:16.650]  Like
[12:16.770 --> 12:20.750]  2004 like three 2004 now probably like 2004
[12:21.210 --> 12:23.210]  2005
[12:23.810 --> 12:25.770]  And
[12:25.770 --> 12:27.770]  Conceptually, it was basically like going around
[12:28.970 --> 12:34.010]  kind of broadcast me it was like when YouTube was first, you know coming onto the scene and
[12:34.690 --> 12:40.490]  there was like the Windows Media Player and QuickTime and all the different formats and
[12:41.970 --> 12:47.110]  But yeah started so it was like software company transitions into kind of
[12:48.110 --> 12:51.030]  Digital media slash agency
[12:52.190 --> 12:53.670]  and
[12:53.670 --> 12:55.710]  We produced also like we produced
[12:56.670 --> 13:03.470]  Media like the technology of media kind of was like one of the focuses but then like e-learning
[13:04.630 --> 13:06.470]  and
[13:06.470 --> 13:08.470]  Like we won an Emmy
[13:09.550 --> 13:14.110]  for a web series we did on AIDS it was like a six-part series and
[13:14.870 --> 13:16.350]  Wow
[13:16.350 --> 13:22.270]  Did that and then chased a girl out to LA and the rest is history
[13:24.150 --> 13:26.150]  Not with a girl but uh
[13:28.350 --> 13:31.950]  Yeah, so when I was in LA I was basically running her
[13:33.830 --> 13:36.430]  Skincare company and trying to turn it around and
[13:37.750 --> 13:46.310]  Then we broke up and I had a you know pooping one-year-old daughter as like a single dad in LA
[13:47.110 --> 13:48.350]  and
[13:48.350 --> 13:50.670]  I was about to start a
[13:52.670 --> 13:54.670]  Computer vision company
[13:54.710 --> 13:56.910]  with a couple of friends like one was a
[13:57.550 --> 14:03.390]  computer science professor at University of Illinois another at Virginia Tech and they had developed
[14:03.990 --> 14:10.750]  object recognition technology, so imagine, you know, I mean now it's starting to become more common, but like, you know, you could
[14:11.750 --> 14:19.470]  Basically aim your phone at a physical object in space and would recognize what it is what vantage point you're looking at it from and
[14:22.430 --> 14:25.350]  So we were working on that but I
[14:26.790 --> 14:28.790]  realized that I'm I
[14:30.110 --> 14:32.390]  Was the business guy and I was like I can't
[14:33.550 --> 14:38.030]  travel around that like I would have to go up to San Francisco to meet with companies down to
[14:38.430 --> 14:45.550]  Like talking to like Walmart down in Arkansas and like HEB in Texas and New York companies
[14:45.550 --> 14:48.310]  And I was like, I can't travel like I have to be
[14:49.150 --> 14:51.150]  Here with my daughter
[14:52.350 --> 14:53.910]  And
[14:53.910 --> 14:56.590]  So I was like and this was kind of when
[14:57.950 --> 15:01.550]  Legal cannabis was starting to gain a lot of steam
[15:02.790 --> 15:04.110]  and
[15:04.110 --> 15:10.230]  I was like, well I could and that this is when the future cannabis project started because I was like
[15:12.630 --> 15:19.910]  In 2013 2014 there weren't there wasn't a lot of mainstream media coverage of the cannabis industry
[15:21.230 --> 15:27.110]  You know now you have like the LA Times has a weed reporter Forbes has what is it Warren Bieber?
[15:27.110 --> 15:28.950]  Oh and like other but like
[15:28.950 --> 15:31.110]  Everybody kind of has the cannabis beat now
[15:31.830 --> 15:33.390]  but
[15:33.390 --> 15:37.430]  Back then what I had was a massive audience of the news industry
[15:38.190 --> 15:45.550]  Because we ran something called the future journalism project, which was my brother's baby kind of looking at the future of news and media and
[15:46.470 --> 15:48.470]  content creation content consumption
[15:50.390 --> 15:52.390]  Monetization and I
[15:53.310 --> 15:55.310]  Was like well
[15:55.310 --> 16:00.630]  The one thing that would be cool would be to take the issues and topics that are important to the people
[16:00.630 --> 16:05.270]  I'm talking to in the cannabis world and get them in front of a
[16:06.030 --> 16:13.070]  journalist at the BBC or at CNN or Fox News or the LA Times or Wall Street Journal or whatever and
[16:14.350 --> 16:21.350]  What they do with that information you can't control but at least you're getting like hey, here's an important emerging topic
[16:21.950 --> 16:28.670]  You know medical cannabis kids with you know, epilepsy other diseases or people getting raided
[16:29.390 --> 16:37.790]  Even though they're doing legal stuff and you know kind of civil asset forfeiture and whatever the stories were but
[16:38.470 --> 16:39.710]  I
[16:39.710 --> 16:43.310]  Was like if I could get those stories in front of the mainstream media
[16:43.350 --> 16:50.110]  That would be kind of my contribution to this world and the world was I mean you remembered it was everybody
[16:51.470 --> 16:54.830]  Starting, you know, I've been growing weed forever
[16:54.830 --> 17:02.070]  And now I have a little brand and like I'm showing up at farmers markets and people are buying my weed and I'm hiring my first
[17:02.070 --> 17:04.870]  Employee who's doing the sales stuff that I don't want to do
[17:06.830 --> 17:11.830]  You know, we're a husband and wife team making tinctures or whatever it is and it was just such a cool
[17:14.830 --> 17:17.750]  For me what I always let and I've told this before but like
[17:19.310 --> 17:21.310]  every other
[17:21.710 --> 17:23.510]  Product or like
[17:23.510 --> 17:25.510]  you know, whether it's liquor or
[17:26.030 --> 17:29.510]  Soft drinks or shoes or cell phones or whatever?
[17:30.070 --> 17:37.490]  It's all you know, everything's rolling up into like a couple big players dominate a space and what was really cool in
[17:38.310 --> 17:40.310]  2012 13 14
[17:41.430 --> 17:47.070]  Was in in California and everywhere it was the inverse it was mom and pops everywhere and
[17:47.870 --> 17:49.870]  nobody was big and
[17:49.950 --> 17:52.590]  Everybody was happy and excited and
[17:53.710 --> 17:55.710]  there weren't any
[17:56.510 --> 18:02.870]  Real barriers to like you could bring a bag of weed into a dispensary and then be like I like your weed like
[18:03.310 --> 18:06.030]  Yeah, buy it and you're like, all right. I'll go make more like
[18:06.750 --> 18:08.750]  this is awesome and
[18:10.830 --> 18:14.910]  So anyway that was the beginning of it and I just kept doing more, you know, it was
[18:15.870 --> 18:21.230]  Covering policy stuff and politics and cultivation and small group. I mean that
[18:22.150 --> 18:24.150]  For me the focus has always been
[18:26.750 --> 18:29.870]  Kind of championing the little guy and
[18:33.030 --> 18:39.670]  Trying to get important issues out there, I mean whether you know people still going to jail, right
[18:41.950 --> 18:43.950]  And so that was kind of the
[18:45.910 --> 18:49.190]  Right the lead-up into and then kovat hit and
[18:49.790 --> 18:53.710]  Like I was doing I mean you spoke at one of the events you came down. I mean that was a
[18:54.510 --> 18:56.510]  Like there were fun
[18:57.030 --> 19:02.350]  Events. Yeah, totally. Oh you came to other events too, right? Right. I forgot about that. Yeah, and
[19:04.230 --> 19:06.230]  Yeah, good times for sure
[19:06.350 --> 19:11.430]  but yeah, then then with kovat like the event stuff obviously came to a screeching halt and
[19:11.750 --> 19:14.990]  So, I remember going lot like I did a couple live things
[19:16.230 --> 19:19.910]  pre-covid because that was a direction I wanted to go in and
[19:22.790 --> 19:26.990]  I always thought the idea of just like bringing interesting people together and
[19:27.710 --> 19:31.470]  Just hitting the record button and letting it go
[19:31.470 --> 19:33.230]  I mean maybe with like a little bit of guidance
[19:33.230 --> 19:39.270]  But just letting the conversations go where they would naturally go and then people get to kind of be flies on the wall
[19:39.270 --> 19:41.070]  I mean remember like we talked in Vegas
[19:41.070 --> 19:45.110]  I was like, this is my concept and you guys were like we all get it and then you
[19:45.670 --> 19:50.390]  Remember we wanted to record something and then I don't know if everyone just always kept getting super high or
[19:51.230 --> 19:54.710]  partially, but we never did it and then I remember one night I went home and
[19:55.430 --> 20:02.750]  Pablo was like dude last night. We had the best conversation and like that's what you should have recorded and I was like, I know
[20:04.950 --> 20:07.510]  So so many good conversations don't get recorded
[20:07.510 --> 20:10.150]  This guy said sounds like Peter is saying goodbye
[20:12.590 --> 20:14.590]  I'll still be here tomorrow
[20:14.630 --> 20:19.230]  Yeah, no, I think I think it's a interesting concept to have you talking for once. It's great
[20:20.790 --> 20:24.670]  Yeah less fun for me less fun for you more fun for the audience
[20:24.670 --> 20:29.390]  I feel like it's important to know where you came from. I feel like a lot of people
[20:30.110 --> 20:33.990]  You know if it's not staring you in the face, you don't know exactly how you got there
[20:33.990 --> 20:39.590]  You do a lot of people just stumble on the future cannabis project and it's like it hasn't been going like this forever
[20:39.590 --> 20:45.070]  It was a real small thing in the beginning and you've really built it up to be something pretty amazing
[20:45.510 --> 20:53.150]  Well, and what's insane is that's all happened during Kovac. That's kind of like like I remember the first one we did was
[20:54.230 --> 20:58.030]  it was Kevin Jodri Scott scams and
[20:58.390 --> 21:00.390]  I think Eric Branstad and
[21:02.830 --> 21:09.110]  Again like my whole thing was always kind of wanting to be the guy behind the scenes like those interviews
[21:09.110 --> 21:11.790]  It would always be like me pairing you and someone else
[21:11.790 --> 21:16.670]  I mean actually ours was me in it because I think like the car everybody's shutting down
[21:18.070 --> 21:20.190]  People and they're like no no, I'm good man
[21:21.710 --> 21:23.710]  I
[21:24.430 --> 21:29.310]  Don't mind talking when I usually so high on weed or mushrooms, but uh
[21:29.830 --> 21:35.390]  Yeah, so that was and and I'd always wanted it to be just like people I find interesting
[21:35.390 --> 21:40.950]  Talking to each other like even if they don't know who each other is or they do different things like
[21:42.110 --> 21:46.550]  It's always been trying to capture that like that's what I've always been trying to do
[21:46.550 --> 21:50.470]  I've always been trying to be like the guy behind the scenes and I've always been like
[21:51.470 --> 21:58.430]  It's always been trying to capture that moment where two people are feeling each other out in a conversation and
[21:58.510 --> 22:05.630]  Then realize they have that common area of passion and interest and just their eyes light up and they just start jamming on that topic
[22:05.790 --> 22:09.390]  Yeah, and and you get it you get that conversation and
[22:11.950 --> 22:17.550]  But then like there'd be a show and the person like I didn't know anything about
[22:18.070 --> 22:20.070]  Like, you know
[22:21.110 --> 22:28.310]  You know plant biology and stuff like that or like mycorrhizal fungi and like it's biology and like
[22:29.590 --> 22:31.110]  There's
[22:31.110 --> 22:38.630]  Conversations where I think either like the person who is supposed to do the interview flaked out who like knew about the topic and
[22:38.630 --> 22:45.390]  It was to interview someone who was like, you know a PhD on the topic and then suddenly it'd be me
[22:45.430 --> 22:50.710]  And then suddenly it'd be me interviewing and being like well, dr. Mike Amaranthus like
[22:51.510 --> 22:54.030]  retired PhD in and like
[22:56.350 --> 23:00.830]  Microbiology with an emphasis on mycorrhizal fungi
[23:02.030 --> 23:04.350]  let me ask you a couple of questions, but
[23:05.990 --> 23:12.830]  So that's why I love your show because it's like times where I just get to chill back and like be in the background and
[23:13.310 --> 23:19.350]  Just doing technical productions versus like having to come up with all the questions and eating sandwiches
[23:21.910 --> 23:25.830]  Yes, totally I've taken dumpster and shows
[23:26.950 --> 23:29.310]  We like I'll be right back like run out of the room
[23:30.550 --> 23:33.550]  Yeah, click yourself out. It's a nobody knows. Yeah, right
[23:34.310 --> 23:39.570]  Yeah, man, it's it's been an interesting journey. I mean we were on I think 27 episodes now and
[23:40.130 --> 23:43.030]  You know with no no end in the future
[23:43.030 --> 23:46.110]  I think my show is gonna change a little bit as far as format
[23:46.210 --> 23:49.850]  We're gonna go away from the zoom style to do it more in person
[23:49.850 --> 23:57.090]  I got a studio set up in Oakland at BP logistics at their facility their distro that's in Oakland and
[23:57.490 --> 24:04.010]  So it's a Joe Rogan style experience is what we're going for and we're gonna be airing it on the future cannabis project
[24:04.010 --> 24:09.090]  Probably starting next week if we get that there's there's some noise dampening issues where there's like this echo
[24:09.330 --> 24:11.330]  You can get rid of that. We'll be
[24:11.490 --> 24:17.330]  We'll be going for that. But let's let's continue talking about you and what you love about cannabis. Why?
[24:17.330 --> 24:19.850]  Yeah, I just quickly I'm seeing in the chat
[24:20.330 --> 24:25.170]  Someone asked if I knew about the Adam Dunn show and hat I didn't know about anything
[24:25.690 --> 24:27.810]  Because I never had any time to watch anything
[24:27.850 --> 24:32.010]  So I would always just be doing my own stuff and then when I started doing the live stuff
[24:32.010 --> 24:38.730]  I just had no idea like I had no idea about hash church and and then people would be like, you know
[24:38.730 --> 24:45.210]  You're broadcasting at the same time as this other show and I'm like, dude. I have no idea like I don't keep track of shit
[24:45.210 --> 24:46.370]  like
[24:46.370 --> 24:48.370]  someone will be I'll be like
[24:48.450 --> 24:52.210]  it's kind of something I love which is just the idea that I
[24:53.090 --> 24:56.450]  Could talk to someone and be like what you're available right now
[24:56.490 --> 24:58.650]  like you want to go live and they're like
[24:58.650 --> 25:06.470]  Okay, and we go live right then and suddenly a couple hundred people and all the people watching. I have no idea how people
[25:07.470 --> 25:11.510]  Like do people have YouTube open do you get like text alerts?
[25:11.510 --> 25:15.430]  I have no idea but it's like people trickle in and that's what's cool about it is
[25:15.910 --> 25:18.590]  you don't need you can be impromptu and
[25:19.670 --> 25:22.190]  I mean, I want to do more of that
[25:24.350 --> 25:31.110]  Just like surprise people being like what's up everybody we're live right now with someone actually really interesting it's not like some
[25:32.190 --> 25:35.550]  shit show it's it's something cool and
[25:37.150 --> 25:39.430]  I think it's kind of moved more towards like
[25:40.670 --> 25:46.950]  All of us learning which I think is and we're all learning together. I mean you're an expert in a lot of ways
[25:46.950 --> 25:49.910]  But there's probably other stuff. Oh, yeah
[25:51.630 --> 25:57.270]  I'm a specialist and I feel like I specialize in certain things and there's people in my show that yeah
[25:57.270 --> 26:01.430]  There's other breeders that know way more than I do. I'm the first one to admit it
[26:01.430 --> 26:03.990]  You know, I enjoy breeding and I've been doing it for a long time
[26:03.990 --> 26:05.710]  I feel like I'm very good at breeding
[26:05.710 --> 26:11.630]  But I feel like there's people out there that specialize in certain things and plant scientists we get guys like Joe Ramadi
[26:12.070 --> 26:16.070]  That dude is a freaking genius man. It's like I also work with him
[26:16.510 --> 26:23.950]  but it's like yeah as far as tissue culture is concerned and you know plant science that guy is miles ahead of me and
[26:24.750 --> 26:28.430]  You know, it's it's great where we can pair people like that and I can have people like that
[26:28.430 --> 26:33.470]  come on and you've given us this platform where it's like everybody learns and everybody benefits and
[26:34.470 --> 26:36.470]  It's it's been lots of fun for sure
[26:36.790 --> 26:43.790]  Yeah, no, and it's it's hearing from people like I mean, I think a lot of the living soil stuff or just generally
[26:44.430 --> 26:49.030]  Whatever you want to call it, you know, it's moving away from hydro tour
[26:49.030 --> 26:56.110]  I mean it's stuff that seems so simple like, you know, I'm always like I wouldn't want to eat hydro tomatoes or
[26:57.070 --> 27:02.190]  You know other stuff that you probably do and you don't even know it though. That's the fun
[27:02.710 --> 27:08.950]  But I don't I do know cuz I grow my own tomatoes and I get them from the farmers market
[27:08.950 --> 27:12.750]  So unless like they're pulling a big scam, but like you only eat them seasonally
[27:14.430 --> 27:16.150]  So
[27:16.150 --> 27:22.510]  weirdly in LA, I feel like my tomatoes all times of year are I
[27:23.110 --> 27:24.790]  mean, I
[27:24.790 --> 27:28.590]  Have tomato plants that I it's written like in a raised bed
[27:28.590 --> 27:34.910]  This little plant will pop up and it's just some tomato seed and I'll let it go and I'll be like and sometimes it's like
[27:34.910 --> 27:39.350]  the little, you know cherry tomato sized tomatoes sometimes it like I just have a
[27:39.870 --> 27:43.990]  Range of tomatoes that are all from tomatoes. I've eaten right
[27:44.870 --> 27:49.470]  but then when they grow in my yard, they're really fucking good and
[27:51.390 --> 27:56.390]  And I think that's it that for me is another thing like I'm starting like when I ship out orders to put
[27:57.070 --> 28:01.750]  Vegetable seeds in orders hoping that people will just grow out
[28:03.310 --> 28:05.310]  Whatever it is and
[28:06.030 --> 28:12.310]  Although on the one hand it's daunting. I'm like, how the fuck do I keep this up and I'm like growing stuff to seeded and
[28:13.350 --> 28:17.030]  I hope other people like Elka's donated stuff
[28:18.550 --> 28:20.550]  Alex Hardy's donated stuff
[28:21.030 --> 28:22.470]  and
[28:22.470 --> 28:24.630]  I like the idea of I
[28:25.510 --> 28:30.230]  Think the past year with everyone stuck at home. It's like people are we're all learning together
[28:31.270 --> 28:32.870]  people are
[28:32.870 --> 28:37.150]  going in directions that they never thought like I get so many people being like
[28:38.390 --> 28:41.550]  because of future cannabis project I've
[28:42.230 --> 28:44.790]  Moved in a direction of like growing my own
[28:45.750 --> 28:52.390]  Cannabis or or growing my own food or I've always grown my own cannabis, but I'm going from hydro to
[28:52.830 --> 28:59.750]  You know soil and I'm I'm really interested in learning how to make my own soil or you know
[28:59.750 --> 29:05.150]  Make my own nutrients or amendments or whatever and like I'm exploring. I think that's like we're all
[29:06.710 --> 29:11.590]  Exploring stuff and you know, I think one of the things is I
[29:13.950 --> 29:18.870]  There's so many people who come on and I get criticism but I'm kind of like
[29:20.350 --> 29:22.350]  Where do I
[29:23.230 --> 29:26.070]  Interject and censor something like
[29:26.950 --> 29:28.070]  there's
[29:28.070 --> 29:31.270]  Everybody who's come on has said something bro science you
[29:31.950 --> 29:35.470]  other people like it's just it's gonna have like
[29:35.710 --> 29:42.830]  You will say something and and someone else who's very smart will disagree with one thing whether it's a soil science topic or a breeding
[29:42.830 --> 29:45.990]  Topic or whatever sure and you everybody maybe
[29:46.990 --> 29:53.030]  History will judge everybody who has opinions on topics of like the dude was right on
[29:53.630 --> 29:59.270]  95% of things but there was 5% he was wrong on but you don't know what 5% you're wrong on and other people are like
[29:59.270 --> 30:03.950]  He's wrong on this, but then someone else will call that person. I'll be like, but he's wrong on that
[30:04.550 --> 30:06.550]  yeah, so for me, it's kind of
[30:07.030 --> 30:09.030]  I've tried to say like
[30:09.990 --> 30:11.990]  Even if someone's an expert
[30:11.990 --> 30:17.270]  Listen to their ideas and if you're interested in implementing it
[30:17.990 --> 30:20.950]  Do it in a small scale
[30:21.790 --> 30:26.790]  Before and and see with your own eyes verify before you
[30:27.510 --> 30:32.110]  Do it across your entire home grow or your commercial grow?
[30:32.350 --> 30:37.990]  Yeah, and then find out that like disaster strikes and you're like, but I followed
[30:38.110 --> 30:42.110]  This idea I saw either on Instagram or on YouTube or wherever
[30:42.550 --> 30:47.910]  But for me, even though there's some stuff that other people disagree with I think
[30:49.350 --> 30:52.950]  The the whole of it I feel like has has
[30:53.950 --> 30:59.030]  Made a positive influence on like moving people in directions of trying stuff. They may
[30:59.950 --> 31:04.590]  Implement the wrong idea and have bad consequences
[31:04.590 --> 31:10.910]  But that person has an intent of like I want to be more organic more
[31:11.670 --> 31:16.750]  Healthy more environmentally conscious like I may have listened to one guy
[31:17.310 --> 31:20.270]  Who was wrong about something and fucked up but like?
[31:20.990 --> 31:26.510]  I'm still moving in a direction. I feel like the over like if I were to try to censor people
[31:28.990 --> 31:30.990]  Because I get like
[31:31.870 --> 31:38.430]  Dms and texts and phone calls all the time about people being like that dudes an idiot. He's wrong
[31:38.430 --> 31:41.230]  He doesn't know what he's talking about. It's like I
[31:42.590 --> 31:44.590]  Get it
[31:44.590 --> 31:48.590]  And I do my best like I give other people opportunities to
[31:49.230 --> 31:56.990]  to make counterpoints like, you know, I heard someone say X and I disagree with it and here is my kind of
[31:57.710 --> 31:59.710]  Not he's an idiot
[31:59.750 --> 32:01.750]  Rationale, but like my
[32:02.270 --> 32:08.990]  scientific rationale of why I think that's you know, it's basically not name-calling but like I
[32:09.950 --> 32:11.950]  Want people to throw?
[32:12.270 --> 32:14.270]  ideas out and
[32:14.270 --> 32:20.790]  Concepts and for the community who's watching as well as other people who are experts to challenge those ideas
[32:21.310 --> 32:26.910]  And I think that's kind of as a communal thing something cool that we've all been doing for the past
[32:27.030 --> 32:30.830]  Year, I mean while everybody has plenty of time to like I
[32:31.710 --> 32:36.190]  Guess events did that type of stuff too. But I feel like this is a little different where it's like
[32:37.230 --> 32:43.910]  Everybody like at an event. You're all just sitting in the audience watching two people or four people talk and
[32:44.590 --> 32:50.030]  Here everybody is like bouncing ideas off each other in the chat. We can see them
[32:50.590 --> 32:52.590]  Like when it's a clubhouse conversation
[32:52.590 --> 32:57.470]  Which is why I like trying to connect YouTube and clubhouse because I feel like
[32:58.150 --> 33:04.510]  what kind of conversations clubhouse allows you to create is really fucking cool and
[33:05.150 --> 33:10.670]  It's a bummer that people on Android can't join clubhouse. But yeah, totally. Yeah
[33:11.790 --> 33:13.790]  That'll change eventually, hopefully
[33:16.030 --> 33:18.030]  But yeah, I'm super high right now
[33:18.870 --> 33:23.870]  Yeah, I'm like tired from working so much I bet if you guys look back here these are all seeds
[33:25.750 --> 33:30.950]  These are all seeds caring. Yeah. All right. So give me give me the process of
[33:33.550 --> 33:38.350]  To make it easy to pull seeds out of a cola. Do you just let it get dry and brittle?
[33:38.750 --> 33:42.550]  So there's all kinds of stuff. So commercial application how I do it
[33:42.550 --> 33:46.030]  I have a thresher and what you do is you take a seed and you put it in a
[33:46.850 --> 33:52.370]  Thresher and what you you know, and I just gotten this new thresher and my buddy does about 70%
[33:53.290 --> 33:58.330]  Dry with about 30% moisture and that that's too much for me
[33:58.330 --> 34:04.410]  I learned I crack some seeds learning but what you would I like to do with this what I experimenting with this new thresher
[34:04.410 --> 34:09.270]  it's called a winter Stiger LD 350 it's a big machine, it costs about
[34:10.510 --> 34:12.510]  $45,000 and
[34:12.510 --> 34:18.670]  Basically it pays for itself though because what used to take me if you have a million seeds you could harvest them and take about
[34:18.670 --> 34:21.610]  A week if you're doing it by hand, which is a pain in the ass this machine
[34:21.610 --> 34:27.110]  You can do everything in a day and then I got a seed cleaner and what you do is you dry it to the bone
[34:27.850 --> 34:31.750]  You know you want you want it as dry as possible bucks material about that big
[34:32.430 --> 34:36.470]  And you feed that into the thresher and it separates the stem
[34:36.750 --> 34:41.450]  The bio has a vacuum and the vacuum actually pulls it and we'll do a video on this on my show
[34:41.530 --> 34:45.430]  There's actually my seed cleaning equipment is at the is it the distro in Oakland?
[34:45.430 --> 34:49.410]  so the vacuum actually pulls the biomass and it pulls the trichomes and and
[34:49.810 --> 34:55.850]  Everything into a 50 gallon drum and then the seeds fall into a separate container. So it separates. There you go
[34:56.810 --> 35:03.370]  LD350 thresher it's things amazing. So where the there's a bag that attaches to the left there and in the bag you get all the stems
[35:04.450 --> 35:07.490]  Yep, and then they don't have the vacuum hooked up
[35:07.490 --> 35:11.690]  But the vacuum is this big thing that hooks up into a 50 gallon drum that pulls
[35:12.050 --> 35:17.650]  All the biomass so you can collect it that guy looks like a German stoner. Oh, yeah
[35:18.330 --> 35:19.650]  Eastern
[35:19.650 --> 35:24.290]  The machine is badass though. It's it's a you know, it's pretty cool. I think
[35:24.970 --> 35:31.930]  HGH they use it and then my friend found out about it. My friend Andrew found out about it from them and he uses it and
[35:33.130 --> 35:35.130]  so I got one and then I got a
[35:35.930 --> 35:37.930]  Floofer seed cleaner
[35:38.090 --> 35:43.530]  To go along with this, but it also does wheat and oh, yeah, you can do other grains
[35:43.530 --> 35:49.890]  You can do grain and so without the vacuum it has a little collector for the biomass on the right there that works. All right
[35:51.410 --> 35:53.690]  But you get your seeds right there
[35:54.330 --> 35:57.650]  Woohoo, but with cannabis seeds that the whole thing will fill up
[35:58.410 --> 36:01.410]  but but so in terms of stickiness like
[36:02.130 --> 36:04.130]  You said it's about 30%
[36:04.610 --> 36:10.130]  Or 70% dry. I prefer running a bone dry. My buddy likes it. Look so he does it outdoor
[36:10.730 --> 36:15.050]  And he's doing it in a greenhouse. And so the biomass is flying all over if you do it
[36:16.290 --> 36:22.410]  In a greenhouse type situation if you don't dry it all the way you're not gonna have as much plant material flying around
[36:23.210 --> 36:26.410]  Which that works for him. I like the bone dry it kind of separates
[36:27.170 --> 36:30.170]  It'll definitely separate all the plant material off the stock
[36:30.930 --> 36:34.690]  But and then separate the seeds and then you just have to run the seeds through a seed cleaner
[36:35.130 --> 36:39.890]  So what used to take me, you know, five or six days I can do now in a
[36:41.210 --> 36:44.710]  Really short amount of time. It's fairly easy to clean but it runs on a
[36:45.130 --> 36:49.730]  230 so you got to have an electrician hook you wire you up. It runs on it's a lot of power
[36:49.730 --> 36:53.050]  it's not something that most people would have in their home, it's a
[36:54.050 --> 36:55.810]  Commercial but you can you know
[36:55.810 --> 37:01.090]  I have it set up so I could load it into a big big truck bring it onto the field and we could
[37:01.170 --> 37:04.170]  You know definitely process in the field if we wanted to
[37:05.050 --> 37:09.930]  so I also have the certain like seed cleaning service of people have seeded bud or
[37:10.050 --> 37:14.730]  If they want me to separate their seeds, I charge about $300 an hour. I can come to your farm
[37:14.890 --> 37:16.890]  You can bring it to Oakland
[37:17.570 --> 37:19.570]  Yeah, this thing works wonders
[37:20.930 --> 37:22.930]  So yeah, and then the
[37:23.450 --> 37:24.570]  poofer
[37:24.570 --> 37:25.770]  which
[37:25.770 --> 37:30.290]  Let's see. I'll give you the spelling so you can pull that up. That's another amazing one, too
[37:30.290 --> 37:35.310]  So that that's a different machine. I thought that was like a piece of equipment on this thing the poofer
[37:35.890 --> 37:38.050]  No, the poofer is spelled
[37:39.130 --> 37:41.130]  PF
[37:42.250 --> 37:47.190]  Let's see, it's PFE you FF er
[37:48.450 --> 37:52.170]  seed sample cleaner and its model number MLN
[37:57.210 --> 37:59.210]  MLN MLN
[38:00.010 --> 38:01.610]  All right
[38:01.610 --> 38:04.170]  Yeah, someone said $300 an hour exclamation
[38:04.170 --> 38:10.210]  Well, you know if you think this thing costs close to 50 and then you're looking at for the the poofers another 20
[38:10.330 --> 38:14.450]  You're you're investing a lot of money. So just to make that back, you know, you're looking at a
[38:15.810 --> 38:17.810]  You're looking at a lot of time
[38:18.330 --> 38:22.890]  So yeah, so this sample cleaner basically operates and you can go on my Instagram
[38:22.890 --> 38:25.090]  I think I've shown pictures of it before but this thing is badass
[38:25.330 --> 38:30.210]  It pulls basically all the chaff all the dust all the white seeds out
[38:30.210 --> 38:32.890]  You just pour it in the top and that's a hopper up there
[38:32.970 --> 38:37.170]  so it spins around and you close the lid and it spins around in that hopper and
[38:38.410 --> 38:40.810]  Loosens up all the stuff on the surface of the seed
[38:41.530 --> 38:46.490]  Yeah, and then it goes through that that's that's the little view hole on the side
[38:46.730 --> 38:51.410]  But there's a vacuum and the vacuum actually pulls it all out and so you end up with really clean seeds
[38:53.890 --> 38:57.090]  So lots of fun that would be satisfying
[38:57.090 --> 39:03.410]  Yeah, so but before before this equipment like one where you last kind of like just oh dude, so it's
[39:05.770 --> 39:10.330]  Well, yeah, so there's like about 400 and something set thousand seeds behind me
[39:10.890 --> 39:16.370]  and that would normally I've done a million 1.2 1 million seeds before in a run and
[39:17.170 --> 39:21.410]  Basically, you either separate those and put them in paper bags. You basically strip it
[39:22.170 --> 39:25.450]  I've done it two ways. I've hung the whole plant and let it go bone dry
[39:26.370 --> 39:32.730]  but my other friends showed me a technique where you strip the plant material right off the stem and you put it in paper bags
[39:32.730 --> 39:34.690]  or on screens and
[39:34.690 --> 39:40.330]  Then you run run it through we had a clipper and I had a clipper for a while and the clippers really good too for
[39:40.330 --> 39:41.210]  What it is
[39:41.210 --> 39:46.850]  But you have to actually homogenize the material so I would use a trim bin and I take that trim bin and I rub all
[39:46.850 --> 39:50.350]  the material around or you know me friends wife
[39:50.870 --> 39:56.510]  Everybody we don't we'd all get you know working and we rub that material around on there and then we run it through the clipper
[39:56.510 --> 40:02.350]  And you know, it would take significantly more time. I feel like you'd lose more seeds
[40:03.350 --> 40:08.190]  So but this is commercial application, but if you're just trying to dry your stuff at home the best way to do it
[40:08.510 --> 40:11.590]  You know that with cheap if you can't afford a clipper
[40:11.590 --> 40:16.830]  I think is to take your material get it, you know, pull it off the stem dry it as quickly as possible
[40:17.230 --> 40:22.550]  You can dry it under your lights is fine running it like 85 90 degrees is okay even and
[40:23.590 --> 40:26.230]  Then you take and you homogenize it on a trim bin
[40:26.230 --> 40:29.070]  You want you want to know why the trim bin is so good is because you get to keep the keef
[40:29.190 --> 40:31.910]  So that keef on the bottom is really high quality
[40:31.910 --> 40:36.910]  You're not trying to push it too hard against the screen, but you're trying to rub it around. So everything rubs around together
[40:37.530 --> 40:42.030]  Then you take that material and you could actually rub it. You can go get at Home Depot
[40:42.030 --> 40:47.190]  You can get these big huge screens for screen doors or get a screen door and you can rub it back and forth and the
[40:47.190 --> 40:51.270]  Seeds will fall where the plant material will stay and then you're gonna kind of pick it by hand
[40:53.430 --> 40:57.790]  You know, there's so many different ways credit card in a shoebox it's like
[40:59.310 --> 41:06.270]  You know, there's all kinds of ways there's a million different ways to skin a cat and that goes along with you know
[41:06.270 --> 41:07.510]  Harvesting your seeds
[41:07.510 --> 41:14.030]  But I think the easiest way is having something where the plant material sticks or stays to it where the seeds roll because they're round
[41:14.830 --> 41:17.230]  You know, it's a it's a lot of work
[41:17.470 --> 41:19.750]  So and the more seeds you have the more work it is
[41:19.750 --> 41:26.190]  So, you know you start getting into commercial production and you need commercial equipment. It's just it's pretty plain and simple
[41:27.230 --> 41:31.410]  So yeah trim bin method has been my way. Yep. I like the trim bin method
[41:34.500 --> 41:36.800]  People whose skin cats actually belong in prison
[41:38.280 --> 41:40.560]  Well, well, you know
[41:42.060 --> 41:44.060]  So yeah, I mean I think
[41:44.680 --> 41:51.320]  It's an interesting process going along and then the real trick because you know, I think seeing these seeds back here
[41:52.360 --> 41:56.340]  These seeds right back here. You're gonna have to take and you're gonna have to dry those for
[41:57.280 --> 42:01.280]  Probably I would say a month before you put them in this any sort of plastic bags
[42:01.280 --> 42:06.320]  I let them sit out for about two weeks. I put some desiccants in them. I move them around every day and
[42:06.720 --> 42:10.640]  You know, they don't go in a seed fridge for quite a while
[42:11.360 --> 42:14.120]  But you don't even want to sell them for a minimum of two weeks
[42:14.120 --> 42:15.400]  and if you do sell them early
[42:15.400 --> 42:19.880]  there's a little trick to you stratify the seeds by putting them in the freezer overnight and
[42:20.320 --> 42:23.200]  The freezer actually stratifies so you'll get better germination
[42:23.640 --> 42:27.040]  Problem with super super fresh seeds is the germination rate goes down
[42:27.280 --> 42:31.020]  So and it'll go up after about two weeks once they're dry they cure out
[42:32.040 --> 42:34.040]  So lots of fun
[42:34.800 --> 42:40.520]  So, are you gonna start breeding Peter or what, you know, you can do your own seed line at least, you know one plant
[42:41.920 --> 42:44.000]  I'm playing around with it
[42:45.720 --> 42:48.220]  That's what I'm kind of setting up down here and
[42:49.320 --> 42:55.680]  SoCal so and I also like I've always wanted to have kind of like the
[42:57.920 --> 43:03.220]  Like, you know the animal farms for like unwanted or abused animals kind of like the
[43:04.240 --> 43:06.080]  farm for
[43:06.080 --> 43:13.080]  like think of all the people who have been keeping something going for like years and years and years and like stress about it be like
[43:13.320 --> 43:18.680]  have another place where that stuff could keep going and having like a group of people tending to
[43:19.800 --> 43:21.800]  those genetics and
[43:22.840 --> 43:31.000]  Yeah, like almost like a museum like people could come visit and walk around and see like old-school genetics and
[43:31.840 --> 43:33.840]  you know unique stuff and
[43:34.040 --> 43:36.040]  so
[43:36.400 --> 43:38.640]  That that's more a longer-term vision but
[43:40.480 --> 43:43.920]  Sounds like fun more projects. Yeah
[43:45.640 --> 43:47.320]  So, yeah
[43:47.320 --> 43:51.560]  Well, you know, it's been a quick show today. I guess we could take questions from the audience
[43:52.280 --> 43:59.400]  Someone said how do I store seeds? I store them in a seed seed fridge typically, but I will I'll store them with desiccant for
[44:00.320 --> 44:06.280]  You know four to six weeks I just keep them in either paper bags or like plastic like this with after two weeks
[44:06.280 --> 44:08.760]  I put the desiccants in but I move around a lot and then
[44:09.240 --> 44:12.920]  I'll put them in big gallon sized plastic bags or in
[44:13.400 --> 44:19.600]  Glass, but I make sure to have a really dry environment and they store in a fridge for long term
[44:21.720 --> 44:25.240]  Works really good. Yeah silica packs desiccant is the same thing
[44:25.880 --> 44:29.120]  So is it bad to store new seeds with silica backs no
[44:29.760 --> 44:36.320]  No, it is not. It's okay. You want to dry those seeds out you want to dry and cure them? It's super super important
[44:36.760 --> 44:39.200]  so so the ones behind you you just
[44:39.960 --> 44:41.960]  Put through the seed sorter
[44:43.040 --> 44:47.760]  So what's that the ones behind you you just put through the seed sorter? Oh, yeah
[44:47.760 --> 44:53.620]  So basically they're separated by variety. These are auto flower seeds, too. So they're separated by variety
[44:53.620 --> 44:57.380]  I made some new stuff with the you know, some of the people's gear and
[44:58.220 --> 45:04.380]  We've tested it out and then I decided to make seeds with the stuff I liked and so it's been ran through the seed sorter
[45:04.500 --> 45:07.100]  It's ready to just dry and cure out
[45:07.660 --> 45:12.100]  But so here it's gonna be no top for oh, I'm not
[45:12.100 --> 45:15.900]  I don't put a top on it for four to six weeks and for four to six weeks
[45:15.900 --> 45:21.060]  You can put a top on it. My friends do I just prefer getting it completely dry ready to go
[45:21.060 --> 45:23.300]  I make sure to agitate it once a day minimum
[45:24.780 --> 45:30.740]  so and I think you know the the I learned I learned a lesson from one of my friends who
[45:31.100 --> 45:35.420]  He called me and said man. I put him I put all the seeds. I just harvested like
[45:36.220 --> 45:38.580]  550,000 seeds man. I think we did pretty good
[45:38.580 --> 45:41.340]  I put him in a five gallon bucket with the lid on I put him in the fridge
[45:41.620 --> 45:45.460]  Worst thing you can do it took his germination rate down 50%
[45:45.860 --> 45:50.940]  So he went from a hundred percent to 50% germination rate by putting the seeds in a fridge
[45:50.940 --> 45:57.140]  He didn't call me till it had been over a day. So one day cost him, you know countless amount of money
[45:57.580 --> 46:00.340]  So luckily they're hemp seeds hemp seeds aren't worth as much
[46:01.100 --> 46:02.780]  but
[46:02.780 --> 46:04.780]  Yeah, a lot of interesting stuff
[46:05.180 --> 46:08.220]  So yeah, there's gonna be some new seeds on the market pretty quickly here
[46:09.060 --> 46:13.100]  Food grade desiccants. No cobalt. Thank you. Mr. Toad 100% I
[46:14.100 --> 46:17.940]  I would say food grade everything if you're using, you know
[46:19.900 --> 46:24.340]  Desiccants anything like that, you know some people I think I use cotton right now
[46:24.340 --> 46:27.660]  But I do have the desiccant bead as well the silica beads
[46:27.740 --> 46:31.500]  So I can put those in the little centerfuge tubes down at the bottom with the seeds
[46:31.980 --> 46:35.820]  I've seen people use rice you can use cotton you can store it
[46:35.820 --> 46:40.240]  You know, if you're only harvesting a small amount of seeds getting those centerfuge tubes is a great way to storm as well
[46:41.240 --> 46:47.120]  So someone saying loud brands products man, there's loud everything these days loud just isn't me anymore
[46:47.120 --> 46:50.240]  So if you see loud don't buy it just because you think it's my product
[46:51.040 --> 46:54.960]  There's a million loud companies. In fact, one of my friends that I met recently he had
[46:56.080 --> 47:02.320]  Before we met he bought a the domain loud weight and that has nothing to do with me. It's an interesting concept
[47:02.320 --> 47:07.240]  I think the name loud kind of took off at one point. I owned the trademark for loud, but
[47:07.920 --> 47:10.200]  Loud, you know, it wouldn't matter if I owned it or not
[47:10.200 --> 47:16.080]  It's not enforceable anymore. So other people can use the name because there's just so many people using it
[47:16.160 --> 47:18.920]  But you had the trademark for a specific use
[47:19.440 --> 47:22.200]  Yeah for we had it for agriculture. We had a
[47:22.800 --> 47:27.520]  Yeah, so we had it for a bunch of different things, but I had loud for you know
[47:27.520 --> 47:31.440]  You couldn't you couldn't get it for cannabis. So and then loud seeds we had the
[47:31.960 --> 47:38.720]  We had the one for clothing but allowed actually in clothing just loud is Tommy Hilfiger owns that
[47:41.400 --> 47:46.600]  And you're gonna take him head-on, oh, yeah, no, no, we're friends now he's a
[47:48.840 --> 47:51.320]  It's like skittles a lawsuit
[47:53.320 --> 47:58.160]  No, my products are not available in the UK right now, but you know, they will be later
[47:58.640 --> 48:05.600]  Later this year we got we're working with some farms out out in Europe to get some product and I think we're gonna have some
[48:05.600 --> 48:10.680]  Seeds out going through distribution out there. So hopefully you guys will be able to get some interesting stuff. I
[48:11.480 --> 48:13.480]  can
[48:15.760 --> 48:20.420]  So you need stuff go through dagger he charges triple
[48:21.420 --> 48:23.420]  Yeah
[48:26.180 --> 48:28.180]  There's the UK surcharge
[48:30.060 --> 48:32.060]  Yeah
[48:32.380 --> 48:36.860]  It's funny, yeah the whole loud thing kind of took it became its own monster
[48:37.900 --> 48:44.900]  There was no loud back in 2010. We were the original the only loud, you know, it was a term used on the streets
[48:45.700 --> 48:49.900]  It's funny. My name James loud came from guys. I was selling some packs to that
[48:50.420 --> 48:55.300]  Joke to call me. Mr. Loud, and then they started calling me James loud thinking it was really funny in the name kind of stuck
[48:55.300 --> 48:58.740]  It was we're selling these packs of a we called the original loud
[48:59.140 --> 49:03.140]  Which we was just called loud back in the day, which it was the original was the first stuff
[49:03.140 --> 49:06.160]  it was a sour diesel spicy jack cross that was
[49:07.220 --> 49:09.220]  Super fire was super gassy
[49:09.620 --> 49:15.340]  It wasn't Jackie at all. There was no jack to it. It was like a nose-burning sour diesel cross and
[49:16.060 --> 49:20.020]  I used to take it to these guys in Oakland. They thought it was so funny calling me James loud
[49:20.580 --> 49:23.940]  And ended up, you know, that's how loud seeds got started
[49:24.980 --> 49:26.980]  So good times
[49:29.860 --> 49:36.020]  But yeah, so yeah any other seed questions you guys got seed storage advice seed fridges
[49:37.140 --> 49:41.740]  Yeah, I mean lab fridges are great. You basically want a fridge that doesn't hold moisture
[49:43.100 --> 49:48.680]  Anybody know Mosca negra Mosca. Yeah, Mosca seeds are great. Yeah, that's a great question. I love
[49:49.160 --> 49:54.560]  Mosca negra I think man they do some good work for sure. He has some good autos
[49:54.560 --> 49:59.180]  He's got some really amazing photo period stuff and he's just an all-around nice guy
[50:00.320 --> 50:03.560]  Yeah, any new auto seeds the new auto seeds will be announced shortly
[50:03.960 --> 50:08.840]  We're doing a germination tests and stuff like that before we release seeds, even if I know they're gonna be good
[50:09.760 --> 50:11.920]  You know because I've worked with both of the parents
[50:12.760 --> 50:18.880]  Multiple times we definitely do testing. So it's just one of those things that's important before you get stuff out
[50:20.880 --> 50:24.320]  So how many days do you have to wait before putting the seeds in a fridge
[50:25.200 --> 50:29.480]  Four to six weeks, you know, some people put them in a little bit sooner. I would say
[50:30.560 --> 50:33.640]  You know if you want to be careful wait six weeks before you go in the fridge
[50:33.640 --> 50:37.080]  But they're probably fine after four weeks for long-term storage
[50:37.880 --> 50:39.880]  Nature freezes the seeds in the wild. Yes
[50:40.760 --> 50:42.760]  Yeah, I mean depending on where you are. But yeah
[50:43.480 --> 50:48.440]  Putting seeds in the freezer isn't necessarily a bad thing. I use a seed fridge
[50:48.440 --> 50:51.800]  I use a lab fridge that I believe it holds it at
[50:53.440 --> 50:58.640]  Six degrees Celsius. What does that work out to Peter? I think it was like 38 degrees
[51:00.040 --> 51:02.040]  I can look it up
[51:02.400 --> 51:04.560]  I can look it up
[51:06.880 --> 51:12.680]  So six to eight degrees Celsius 40 42 to 43, okay, that's what that's perfect
[51:13.440 --> 51:20.900]  So that's a little bit warmer than your fridge for your your stuff at home, which is usually yeah 40
[51:20.900 --> 51:22.900]  There you go
[51:23.320 --> 51:25.360]  So, let's see
[51:26.080 --> 51:29.880]  Around 15 we're getting interesting stuff who's got good questions
[51:31.560 --> 51:35.340]  Herm not hemp
[51:35.380 --> 51:37.380]  Like it
[51:37.420 --> 51:40.980]  Is the freezer better than the fridge? I don't store my stuff in a freezer. I think
[51:41.620 --> 51:44.100]  Long-term if you're talking about many years
[51:45.020 --> 51:47.020]  freezer, I think
[51:47.580 --> 51:52.100]  Storing in a freezer is possible. So, you know pollen another thing and it's really interesting
[51:52.100 --> 51:57.100]  You know that my friend brought to my attention is the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
[51:57.140 --> 52:03.900]  Best way to store pollen long term is to actually use a freeze dryer. You freeze dry it you store it long term and cryo and
[52:05.100 --> 52:07.660]  It'll last a lot longer, you know, I store my stuff
[52:08.460 --> 52:10.780]  See if I have any around here. Well, I
[52:11.740 --> 52:17.620]  Have pollen all over the place, but I store my palm with desiccants in the fridge or freezer and it works a lot
[52:17.620 --> 52:20.620]  It's just you cannot get it moist the second it gets moist it
[52:21.740 --> 52:26.340]  Deactivates it it reverses the magnetism on it and it won't it won't work to pollinate plants. So
[52:28.060 --> 52:32.200]  So someone said what should I look for in my glue lot of seedlings
[52:33.380 --> 52:38.380]  I would say you're looking for something that's in between the gorilla glue and the
[52:39.020 --> 52:44.140]  Gelato 41 so you're looking for something that's got gas a little perfume lavender
[52:44.380 --> 52:47.820]  But you know nice the I would say that dense
[52:48.700 --> 52:50.960]  Glue structure kind of knuckles up
[52:51.600 --> 52:54.880]  You can find stuff that finishes in 63 days or less
[52:55.440 --> 53:01.680]  So it's not just a structure thing, I mean I always go for turps first so go for your turps then go for your structure
[53:02.720 --> 53:06.480]  Glue lotto is a fun one, you know, if you're looking for the flower
[53:06.480 --> 53:11.160]  You can get it at Canada organics up in Washington from my partners up there. They crush it
[53:16.580 --> 53:22.700]  420 giveaway they will be sent out tomorrow. I believe either tomorrow or Tuesday, but people will be getting in this week
[53:23.220 --> 53:25.580]  So we had some issues with people cheating
[53:26.860 --> 53:31.540]  So we're not gonna be doing any giveaways anytime soon till I can figure out how to make it more fair
[53:33.060 --> 53:35.500]  I'm sending seeds out to everybody but I think
[53:36.260 --> 53:42.060]  Sucks when you know a small group of people ruin it for everybody, but it's bound to happen
[53:44.340 --> 53:50.380]  Yeah, and then daggett I love we're gonna have some new seeds on daggage shortly probably within the next month
[53:51.380 --> 53:57.220]  Exciting new crosses you've been working with, you know, I have some exciting new stuff that I haven't released
[53:57.220 --> 54:00.100]  there's I have a ton of stuff that I haven't released, but I have a
[54:01.300 --> 54:06.420]  One that in particular which is blueberry muffin times purple tangy, which was a project
[54:06.420 --> 54:12.620]  I did with a guy named og Steve who he's the guy that found the seed from the DNA tangy. That was a purple Fino and
[54:13.540 --> 54:17.220]  we have a cross of it and the blueberry muffin stuff was hunted by
[54:18.220 --> 54:26.820]  Dirty arm farms in Oregon and I'm really excited about that one. I feel like it's super turpy. It's not super tangy, but it's it's a
[54:27.540 --> 54:31.380]  Definitely potent. So if you know Jamie up there and you want to try it out, you should hit him up
[54:33.340 --> 54:35.340]  Dude grows killer weed
[54:36.180 --> 54:39.980]  He makes amazing extract as well. Can you recommend a couple of strains?
[54:39.980 --> 54:46.900]  It'll be good to start practicing breeding with that compliment each other for flavor and high
[54:47.460 --> 54:52.340]  Or or even just for plant structure. I mean, I think yeah, I think that it's more
[54:53.900 --> 54:55.140]  So
[54:55.140 --> 54:58.340]  You know with breeding you want if you're looking there's so many good things
[54:58.340 --> 55:01.940]  So it's really depending on what you like as far as things that complement each other
[55:01.940 --> 55:06.820]  I'll tell you stay away from oh geez if you're just starting to breed
[55:06.820 --> 55:08.820]  I mean not only are they finicky plants I
[55:08.820 --> 55:12.700]  Can tell you what to stay away from more than I could tell you what to work with. There's a ton of stuff
[55:13.700 --> 55:19.020]  You know, but like oh geez are very difficult you look at cookies cookies are very easy
[55:19.020 --> 55:25.020]  You can cook varieties very easily that are dominant with cookies. But the problem is is they have
[55:26.260 --> 55:33.700]  Intersexual traits that are really bad. So hermaphrodites a lot of recurrence of hermaphrodites and so cookies in
[55:34.260 --> 55:35.540]  particular
[55:35.540 --> 55:40.740]  Someone says blue dream is a great place to start. Well blue dream is a very stable variety, but I feel like
[55:41.380 --> 55:47.220]  You know and then structure it's it's the it's at the pinnacle of structure blue dream has the best structure
[55:47.220 --> 55:50.260]  You could shit in the reservoir and get 2.2 pounds per thousand watt
[55:50.700 --> 55:54.420]  Is it something everybody likes is it something I like to smoke not necessarily?
[55:55.180 --> 55:58.300]  but uh, you know as far as for structure, but you know
[55:58.300 --> 56:04.620]  I think if you look you want to breed stuff and you want diversity so that you're looking for because really the breeding
[56:04.740 --> 56:06.300]  I'll tell you what
[56:06.300 --> 56:10.700]  People call themselves breeders all the time. Most most of them don't even know this their seed producers
[56:10.700 --> 56:13.900]  If you're not doing back crossing, you're not doing stabilization
[56:13.900 --> 56:20.100]  You're just a seed producer to do breeding. It takes actual pheno hunting and you know work, you know
[56:20.340 --> 56:24.700]  that's what a breeder is, you know that we live in this world where we simplify stuff and
[56:25.500 --> 56:29.460]  Really breeding is more about the pheno hunting than making the seeds
[56:29.980 --> 56:35.060]  Ton of people and blue dream amazing strain, I love it. I've done crosses with it
[56:35.060 --> 56:38.620]  You know, we had the loud dream for a while we had
[56:39.420 --> 56:44.620]  We had one cross with amnesia, which was a dementia. There was a big like collab with
[56:45.260 --> 56:49.340]  Europe we had the amnesia times the blue dream and that that was fire, but uh
[56:49.980 --> 56:51.980]  You know, it's it's real interesting
[56:52.420 --> 56:58.060]  Yeah breeder. No, you're just a producer guy says I'm a breeder. I have five kids now. You're just a kid producer
[56:58.060 --> 57:00.060]  You're just a kid producer
[57:02.980 --> 57:07.460]  So, yeah, unless you're selecting the females for specific purposes
[57:08.660 --> 57:10.660]  For sure, you're selecting those traits
[57:11.740 --> 57:19.040]  Why I think part of it would kind of be like work with plants that you know, right like have something that you know
[57:19.980 --> 57:26.300]  How it grows how it smokes how it smells so that when you cross with other stuff you kind of know what's going on
[57:26.740 --> 57:33.840]  Yeah, and as a beginner what I would recommend honestly, you know, I would say start out with regular don't worry about feminized and
[57:34.700 --> 57:38.580]  You know, some people want to jump right into the femme game and I think that's okay
[57:38.580 --> 57:42.820]  They want to you want to make money right away. I think it's more important to learn how to do it correctly
[57:42.820 --> 57:45.460]  So buy some rake varieties online
[57:46.060 --> 57:48.180]  You know seeds here now daggett love
[57:48.180 --> 57:53.540]  There's some great resources out there with stuff and what you're looking for is diversity in the beginning
[57:53.540 --> 57:55.780]  I think it's better to start out with something that's
[57:56.620 --> 57:58.500]  leaning towards that
[57:58.500 --> 58:01.660]  equatorial tropical like what you'd call a sativa and
[58:02.340 --> 58:07.420]  take something like that and find something that's really indica dominant cross those together and then
[58:07.940 --> 58:13.900]  See the varieties of stuff you get in your progeny so you can start looking for stuff that is right in the middle
[58:13.900 --> 58:20.840]  You can stuff you find stuff that leans towards the you know, the indica afghanica those those really, you know
[58:20.840 --> 58:27.000]  The tighter bud structure the smaller plants and then you find stuff that leans towards the equatorial sativa side
[58:27.000 --> 58:27.640]  and you know
[58:27.640 --> 58:28.920]  That's a lot of fun too
[58:28.920 --> 58:34.880]  Because you really get to see your work in action when you have a bunch of diversity if you're just crossing a gelato
[58:35.040 --> 58:37.040]  with another gelato
[58:37.240 --> 58:39.240]  You're gonna get gelato
[58:39.440 --> 58:41.600]  Something very similar to gelato, you know
[58:41.600 --> 58:43.440]  And it's like even though it might have a different name
[58:43.440 --> 58:50.520]  You really have to do the research because if you're crossing gelato 41 with sunset sherbert thinking you're coming up with something new
[58:50.520 --> 58:55.400]  That's just a back cross, you know, and a lot of stuff we're doing is like this bottlenecking of
[58:57.280 --> 58:59.720]  Diversity we're taking that and we're bottlenecking
[59:00.040 --> 59:05.880]  These varieties down into because we're doing so much back crossing and reinforcing bad traits
[59:05.880 --> 59:07.880]  a lot of this stuff is going on and so
[59:08.440 --> 59:13.720]  In breeders someone said in breeders. Yeah, people don't even know they're in breeding and they're in breeding and it happens all the time
[59:14.640 --> 59:19.480]  it happened in Europe with with the Hays and it's happening, you know here with the gelato's and
[59:20.520 --> 59:24.480]  I mean, this is just normal with stuff and there's a handful of people doing real work. Oh
[59:25.920 --> 59:28.660]  Isn't gelato times sherbert just runs or gushers
[59:28.660 --> 59:34.600]  I believe runs is actually supposed to be a Skittles bag seed and gushers is gelato times sunset
[59:34.600 --> 59:41.480]  Sure, no, I think a gushers is TK times gelato. I'm pretty sure it's triangle Kush times gelato
[59:41.800 --> 59:47.240]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but uh, you know, there already is a gelato times sherbert and there's nothing wrong with that
[59:47.240 --> 59:49.240]  But that's a back cross. So
[59:49.240 --> 59:55.380]  Regardless of what you think you're making something that has slight variation. You're not taking something that you know
[59:55.380 --> 59:57.840]  You're not finding a whole bunch of diversity in there. You're not going to
[59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.760]  you know, maybe s1 has
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.600]  No male, that's why
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:09.080]  Well, you know and and selfing stuff that if you want to get into feminized breeding selfing stuff is interesting
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.360]  I think you know
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:15.280]  You can put something on itself to see the different phenotypes the different diversity within that plant
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:20.080]  You know if you had something totally stable and you selfed it you would get exactly the same thing
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:24.840]  But that doesn't happen with cannabis. What happens is you'll get genetic diversity. So you'll get several phenotypes
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:29.440]  Someone says has anybody worked with juice box juice box is one of my favorite varieties
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:36.360]  So I think you know, you got the white runs you got the gelato 41 you got two varieties. You can't go wrong with
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.540]  You're gonna get some amazing chirpy stuff
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.720]  You're gonna get good structure with that
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.640]  I feel like there's a the whole bunch of things you're looking for and depending on what you like
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.360]  You'll find it in there if you're into like the gelato
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:56.200]  You know that if that's your game and you like gelato runs gushers all those things that juice boxes
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.680]  You know, you'll find a lot of stuff that you like in there
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:06.640]  Gelato I had didn't taste like root arouse. I don't know why it would it shouldn't gelato root arouse tastes like hey
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.400]  so
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.640]  Cindy 99 that's an interesting one
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:19.360]  You know, I think we've gone away from orange and lemon turps, although I really like lemon turps
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.080]  I liked you know tangy was the number one strain for a long time
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:28.400]  I don't know if you guys remember tangy, but uh, you know tangy's kind of it got played out a little bit
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:35.160]  It's not the strongest smoke, but it's definitely something that carries, you know in the outdoor a lot of people grew tangy outside
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.840]  it yields good and it's turpy but
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:45.960]  You know and then I think as a beginning breeder stay away from Jack's because the problem with anything that's got Jack or Hayes
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.800]  terpenoline limonene that combination
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.360]  That's in Jack is a super you'll hear me talk about on the show, but it's super dominant
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.040]  And so you can get it in 99% of the progeny when you breed it with something
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.920]  Skunk crosses is another one man skunk has been on the topic of a lot of people lately
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.440]  Reading the chats jolly canna said skunk crosses skunk is cool
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:15.440]  It's most people when they have skunk crosses, you know cheese's skunk. She's got number one
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.800]  There's a lot of interesting stuff in skunk and skunk number one
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:26.000]  And the problem with skunk is most of it's not that skunky it's like the sweet side of it so
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:31.720]  Be weary of skunk if you're buying seeds of skunk thinking you're gonna get some stuff. That's really skunky
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:37.720]  Shoreline is pretty skunky for what it is. We're gonna be doing a show coming up in the near future on
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.000]  skunk and on shoreline specifically on shoreline
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:50.840]  So, I think it's 1203 we might want to call it a day for Mother's Day unless anybody has some amazing question
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:55.080]  We'll end with one more Callio times skunk. What is?
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.800]  Tangy people get used to the skunk and then just call Callio
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.160]  Let's see
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:09.800]  Berry flavors
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.080]  Anything on the berry flavors
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:19.880]  Yeah, so I mean berry is not necessarily that that terpene profile that that comes off
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.880]  Berry is not necessarily a dominant
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:28.680]  Trait it can be recessive. I would say most of the time it's recessive. Although you know, you get blueberry muffin and
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.120]  So it can be dominant or recessive. But in the so for example the
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:40.280]  F2 of the original loud is where we found the loud berry and that is dead on like berry turps
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:48.400]  So I got a cat piss question good job guys, we're gonna be doing another cat piss show shortly talking to Tom talking to some
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.040]  other guys
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.920]  But yeah, Barry back to berry turps
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:57.640]  I think berry turps can be bred for blueberry muffin is great for berry turps DJ short blueberry
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:01.440]  But there was a blueberry from Oregon back in the day that was mine
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.640]  And it was a sativa and it was like these big giant spears
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.240]  huge spears and
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:12.080]  These spears reeked of blueberry and a little bit of pine and blueberry
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.840]  It wasn't super gassy, but you know big white spears and this is before the DJ short blueberry
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:24.320]  And I used to grow it. I absolutely loved it. It wasn't blueberry haze though, but it was super super fire
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.960]  So, yeah, and if you guys got questions you can always reach out to me
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.600]  And if you guys got questions, you can always hit me up on Instagram
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.560]  Tag me in your photos if you buy my gear
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.440]  tag Budgasm to
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:47.600]  Why have land races been so ignored in breeding projects lately if everything is but I don't think land races have been ignored I think
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.280]  most people
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.600]  Wouldn't know where to begin if they were working with land races because they're difficult to work with
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.500]  Typically and it has some you have to put time into it. It's very easy to take
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:06.400]  You know a clone of this that you bought from this guy and friggin sub pollinate that you made from reversing a plant or you?
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:11.680]  Got from a you know a regular seed and put that on something and get something decent
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:17.600]  You have to work with larger progenies. You have to be very patient the guys who are doing a really good
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.520]  you know for the most part, you know, and I'm not talking about the
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.160]  more
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.360]  modernized commercialized versions of land race varieties
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.840]  Like red Congolese red Congolese has been done and selected
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:36.680]  I think a lot of those varieties take a lot of work if you're talking about working it, you know working genetics
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:42.460]  That's real breeding. You know, I think it takes time and that it's a a lot of people want the easy route
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:46.800]  You know, they want to go the easy easy path. It's a lot. It's a lot easier
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.100]  It's a lot easier to make decent seeds and you know, most people are working with small environments
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:56.900]  It's hard to breed with land race and do good selections and you know be able to pheno hunt
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:06:01.340]  Which is really the big part of breeding that I keep talking about is pheno hunting
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:05.980]  Anybody can make seeds you guys should all be making seeds, but you should all be pheno hunting, too
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:11.640]  You want to be a breeder pheno hunt? That's what makes the best breeders. Is that pheno hunting part and doing the selection?
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:16.380]  You know anybody in the world can make seeds, you know, it's not it's not hard
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:18.380]  You take pollen you put it on a plant you grow it out
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:22.020]  There's ways you can fuck that up to believe me but uh
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:29.180]  You know, we're working with all these complex polyhybrids. It'd be great to see you guys working with some more land-raised stuff. There's
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.500]  plenty of sources
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.260]  What if I want to smoke the flower that I'm keeping seeds from?
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:40.900]  Hmm. I've never smoked the flower. I mean I've tested the flower, but I've never smoked it because it's so loaded
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:45.980]  You know, I mean I would say smoke the the Paul you could smoke the not the pollen
[01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:49.780]  But you can smoke the trichomes the keef. Yeah, that's great
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:55.300]  As long as you're not springing any colloidal silver on it or anything like that. I would stay away from smoking stuff
[01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:57.300]  That's sprayed with silver. Yes
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:03.420]  But as far as smoking the trichomes off of seeded plants, there's nothing wrong with that
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.900]  It's just it's kind of weird with basically
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:13.060]  All that the chaff that's in there is gonna make it harsh, but unless you take the friggin trichomes off
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:18.460]  So or if you cover, you know, they have pollen bags, but you could technically work that in reverse cover
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:24.540]  Take pollen bags put it on some of your buds so that they don't get pollinated and so that you have an example of the
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:30.240]  Flower that you're breeding with that's always an idea. Then you can smoke that it's gonna taste amazing look amazing
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:38.860]  Colloidal silver is good for you. Colloidal silver is good for you to ingest. I do not think smoking colloidal
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.860]  So far is a great idea
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:45.020]  You know, I don't I don't have any papers in front of me that I can say yeah
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.820]  You don't want to smoke colloidal silver. I just think it probably isn't a good idea
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:57.220]  Someone making only f1s to me isn't a breeder I agree you got karma genetics
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:07:59.900]  What's up?
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.900]  So yeah, I appreciate you guys
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:09.460]  Breeder Steve uses it for hash. Yeah, I use it for ash too. I love it for ash. I had some in funny
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:14.020]  The funny thing with hash is sometimes two or three years later the ash is better
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:18.660]  It's funny how that works. I just let it sit in my garage for a long time and
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:22.620]  It was it was keef and it turned into hash and some of its amazing
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:29.180]  So, yeah a lot of people like that dark sunset we see
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:37.260]  When these guys said bless up James I've got you know dark sense and I'm about to flush the others a couple weeks behind
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:40.060]  Thank you beautiful plants. I'm obsessed with the smell
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:45.680]  Love that smell I can tell you it's gonna smell gelato in and sherbet
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:50.380]  Yeah, sure. It's one of those ones that didn't get it. It didn't quite get its day. I
[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:54.700]  feel like sherbet is just as good if not better than gelato and
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:58.660]  You know, I absolutely love sunset sherbet
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.760]  Smokes amazing smokes down to the roach
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.580]  But yeah great show today Peter
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:07.420]  You too James
[01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:10.260]  Glad we got to know you
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.540]  A little better
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.860]  So, yeah, we're gonna get my sonic on here and
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.580]  He's got some surprises for you. So we'll have him on
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:21.580]  I've been talking to him about coming on the show and
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:25.860]  We're gonna do it last week then I was gonna do it this week and then things got delayed
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:28.580]  So we got Peter on instead. It's right on the
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.980]  What is it like the understudy subbing in?
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:36.860]  No, that was good man, I really you know, I'm glad we get to hear a little bit about you you've done so much for the
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:42.020]  Community and for the people watching the show and yeah, I wouldn't be here today talking to you guys without you
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:48.140]  So thank you very much. And I look I look forward to the new format. It's gonna be interesting
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:53.780]  We'll have to get you up to the Bay Area. Yeah, you guys come up and we'll hang out and check out the studio. I
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.220]  Like it
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:57.980]  Alright. Well everyone
[01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:00.820]  Kiss a mom have a happy Mother's Day and
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:05.380]  We will see you soon. If you don't have a mom kiss a female plant
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:09.380]  You guys have a good one, thank you very much
