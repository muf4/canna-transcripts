[00:00.120 --> 00:07.860]  send this to myself, but we are live. Welcome everyone as I send the show
[00:07.860 --> 00:11.700]  graphic to my other computer. But anyway, James, take it away.
[00:11.700 --> 00:16.540]  Hey, how's it going everybody? This would be week 14. It's not an official James
[00:16.540 --> 00:21.360]  Loud show. We are doing a little holiday giveaway for everybody that's tuning in
[00:21.360 --> 00:27.060]  live. So yeah, we're gonna do some trivia and Peter and I are gonna answer some
[00:27.060 --> 00:30.860]  questions if you guys got questions. But I'm gonna be giving away some of the
[00:30.860 --> 00:36.460]  loud canogenic stuff and some of the ganja farmer seeds and I got some t-shirts
[00:36.460 --> 00:41.060]  and I got some other cool things like these sleeves right here from Miami
[00:41.060 --> 00:49.220]  Mango. So happy holidays everybody. Thanks for tuning in. So do we have any
[00:49.220 --> 00:52.340]  questions? We can start off with some questions. Peter, you got any questions?
[00:52.340 --> 00:59.660]  Well, so I had forwarded you about one minute ago a couple questions from the
[00:59.660 --> 01:03.940]  email inbox. Okay. And they were quite lengthy and I should have sent them.
[01:03.940 --> 01:10.540]  Maybe when Lance is giving away the bong you can read the questions. Perfect.
[01:10.540 --> 01:15.980]  So yeah, let's do some breeding questions for the audience that
[01:15.980 --> 01:19.740]  you know, I guess the first thing we want to give away is some seed packs. So
[01:19.740 --> 01:25.020]  let's give away a pack of Jaffata, which is amnesia times super silver haze.
[01:25.020 --> 01:31.660]  We're giving away five packs to people tuning in for fantastic fun trivia
[01:31.660 --> 01:38.420]  questions. So in F1 when we're talking about seeds and breeding, what does the
[01:38.420 --> 01:44.260]  F stand for? So basically the first person to respond in the chat. First
[01:44.260 --> 01:49.340]  person that responds in the chat. And how it's gonna work is you respond in the
[01:49.340 --> 01:53.220]  chat. If you have the right answer, go ahead. Oh, here we go.
[01:53.220 --> 01:58.020]  Well, you had first generation and then right after him was filial generation. I
[01:58.020 --> 02:03.260]  know. Sorry. Sorry. Actually, we had a whole bunch of filials. Holy shit. I
[02:03.260 --> 02:09.660]  missed all those. Wait, there are actually a million people who... I don't know if he meant...
[02:09.660 --> 02:17.380]  Yeah, it is filial. Filial generation is the correct answer.
[02:17.380 --> 02:23.820]  So should we give credit to the wrong spelling of the correct answer? The K is
[02:23.820 --> 02:29.100]  right next to the L on the keyboard. Yeah, it's a tough one. But no, I mean, I
[02:29.100 --> 02:33.820]  think you gotta have it spelled correctly. Someone said MK was first. So let me go
[02:33.820 --> 02:42.740]  back. Yeah, if other people could help me out. I know. Wait, sorry. We had way before...
[02:42.820 --> 02:48.060]  Wait, how the fuck do I miss all this? Okay, yeah, you're right. MK was first. There were a
[02:48.060 --> 02:55.540]  lot of people who answered. Okay, so this one will go to MK. Anyone have a
[02:55.540 --> 03:01.980]  problem with that as the first person to answer? No. MK, so what we need you to do is email
[03:01.980 --> 03:09.500]  jameslabgenetics at gmail.com with your information or send Peter a message. I
[03:09.500 --> 03:17.940]  think just emailing is gonna be the easiest way. And someone had phenotypes.
[03:17.940 --> 03:23.490]  We got some really interesting answers.
[03:23.490 --> 03:30.810]  So define... Well, actually, why don't you just define what filial generation means or filial or...
[03:30.810 --> 03:38.570]  So an F1, a true F1 is when you take two P1s and you cross them together. So
[03:38.570 --> 03:45.690]  P1s would be... Some people think of them as land race genetics, but homozygous, where
[03:45.690 --> 03:51.250]  there's no phenotypical variation in the plant. When you take two stable lines
[03:51.250 --> 03:58.650]  like that and you cross them together, you get a true F1. So filial generation.
[03:58.650 --> 04:04.250]  Yeah, good job, guys. We got a whole bunch of people. Christmas again. Yeah, it is
[04:04.290 --> 04:06.490]  like Christmas again. Where is everybody tuning in from?
[04:06.490 --> 04:10.890]  Oh, yeah, I saw that. Hold on.
[04:10.890 --> 04:15.890]  Yeah, this year's been tough for a lot of people. I think we've been kind of blessed in the cannabis industry.
[04:15.890 --> 04:18.890]  And I just would love to share some seeds and everything.
[04:18.890 --> 04:23.890]  Here's actually a question for you.
[04:23.890 --> 04:32.890]  First cross intentional or accidental? Okay. You know, we were messing around with stuff.
[04:33.130 --> 04:40.130]  I had seeds from some Mexican weed that... This has to be in maybe 2000, where we had some males.
[04:40.130 --> 04:45.130]  And so I was experimenting with pollen from that and putting it on.
[04:45.130 --> 04:53.130]  We had some... What was it called? DJ Short had a blueberry, but we had a different blueberry back then
[04:53.130 --> 05:00.130]  that was a blueberry from, I believe, from Oregon originally. And it was a spear-shaped plant
[05:00.370 --> 05:07.370]  that grew really tall, unlike the Indica counterpart that most people know of blueberry today.
[05:07.370 --> 05:11.370]  I just caught that. He always says, can you filial feel me?
[05:11.370 --> 05:13.370]  Nice.
[05:13.370 --> 05:16.370]  I can filial feel you.
[05:16.370 --> 05:23.370]  Bag seed. Yep. Experimenting with bag seeds. I think bag seeds have been a real interesting part of cannabis history.
[05:23.610 --> 05:28.610]  I think a lot of the great varieties from the past were bag seeds.
[05:28.610 --> 05:33.610]  People are moving away from bag seeds, but bag seeds are still special.
[05:33.610 --> 05:39.610]  So if you find a seed in a bag, pop it, germinate it, get that thing going.
[05:39.610 --> 05:43.610]  What? Smalls here in Dover, Mass, my hometown.
[05:43.610 --> 05:45.610]  Dover, Mass.
[05:45.610 --> 05:47.610]  My roots.
[05:47.610 --> 05:51.610]  So Peter, you got that down for MK as being the Jaffata?
[05:51.850 --> 05:57.850]  I'm going to leave the responsibility entirely up to MK to remember that MK was the winner.
[05:57.850 --> 05:59.850]  Okay. Well, I wrote it down.
[05:59.850 --> 06:01.850]  Excellent.
[06:01.850 --> 06:05.850]  Paul and Chuckers have made this industry.
[06:05.850 --> 06:12.850]  There's something to be said for traditional breeding methods and breeding as well.
[06:12.850 --> 06:17.850]  I think everything has its place, but you can't overlook the power of the bag seed
[06:18.090 --> 06:21.090]  with some of the most popular varieties out there.
[06:21.090 --> 06:25.090]  Espana, shout out to Ace. Very nice.
[06:25.090 --> 06:30.090]  Save some seeds and flower. Yeah, I found some really interesting stuff in bag seeds.
[06:30.090 --> 06:34.090]  Big ups to Eugene, Oregon. Cape Cod, Mass.
[06:34.090 --> 06:39.090]  A lot of people respond to that. I'm just like, Sedona.
[06:39.090 --> 06:42.090]  If there are a lot of seeds in your bag, don't pop those.
[06:42.330 --> 06:44.330]  I disagree with that.
[06:44.330 --> 06:48.330]  I think pop everything.
[06:48.330 --> 06:50.330]  Pop everything and see what comes out.
[06:50.330 --> 06:55.330]  I think that's an interesting method for breeding is the element of surprise.
[06:55.330 --> 06:57.330]  Some people breed with intent.
[06:57.330 --> 06:59.330]  Some people breed to be surprised.
[06:59.330 --> 07:01.330]  There's nothing wrong with doing both.
[07:01.330 --> 07:06.330]  Having lots of bag seeds, I think you're looking at something that has a tendency
[07:06.330 --> 07:10.330]  to have more intersexual traits, but there still might be something interesting in there.
[07:10.570 --> 07:16.570]  To say that you shouldn't pop something, I think that goes against how I feel
[07:16.570 --> 07:20.570]  because I feel like you can improve upon stuff.
[07:20.570 --> 07:22.570]  You can look at that in multiple ways.
[07:22.570 --> 07:26.570]  If you're worried about intersexual traits, yeah, I think that's something to be concerned about.
[07:26.570 --> 07:30.570]  Now, if you have something special, my friend Midnight Rider,
[07:30.570 --> 07:34.570]  he came across, he had a light leak in the room, I think,
[07:34.570 --> 07:38.570]  and got a bunch of bag seeds, but some of the strongest, most potent cannabis
[07:38.810 --> 07:42.810]  I've ever seen came from some bag seeds.
[07:42.810 --> 07:46.810]  My whole run for this next year will be Aaron's seeds here from this.
[07:46.810 --> 07:48.810]  Wow, nice.
[07:48.810 --> 07:52.810]  We got people from Oklahoma, Vienna,
[07:52.810 --> 07:54.810]  Smaltimore.
[07:54.810 --> 07:56.810]  Can't go wrong with Smaltimore.
[07:56.810 --> 07:58.810]  I had to go through a lot of response.
[07:58.810 --> 08:02.810]  I was like, click, click, click.
[08:02.810 --> 08:04.810]  Yeah, and then we ordered seeds.
[08:04.810 --> 08:06.810]  The seeds have come out.
[08:07.050 --> 08:09.050]  Peter shipped off everything in the last week.
[08:09.050 --> 08:13.050]  Everything except for international, which I figured after Christmas would be safer
[08:13.050 --> 08:17.050]  because it sounds like shit's getting lost.
[08:17.050 --> 08:21.050]  Internationally, across the oceans.
[08:21.050 --> 08:23.050]  Nice.
[08:23.050 --> 08:27.050]  Well, let's get into some other questions.
[08:27.050 --> 08:29.050]  Who was on the show last week?
[08:29.050 --> 08:35.050]  Whoever answers the question correctly is getting a pack of Jelly Bellies.
[08:35.290 --> 08:37.290]  The loud Jelly Bellies.
[08:37.290 --> 08:45.630]  All right, let me go to the live chat.
[08:45.630 --> 08:47.630]  Wait, has no one answered.
[08:47.630 --> 08:49.630]  There's a Von D, I see.
[08:49.630 --> 08:51.630]  But this is going so fast.
[08:51.630 --> 09:00.230]  We got some JJs.
[09:00.230 --> 09:02.230]  All right, I see Top Dog.
[09:02.230 --> 09:04.230]  All right, sorry. Top Dog.
[09:04.230 --> 09:06.230]  Top Dog is the correct answer.
[09:06.230 --> 09:10.230]  JJ is also the correct answer because JJ is from Top Dog.
[09:10.230 --> 09:12.230]  Okay, so we had, oh yeah, Von D, you were saying.
[09:12.470 --> 09:14.470]  Right, so Von D seems like it was the first one.
[09:14.470 --> 09:18.470]  Oh yeah, did they have to answer both or is one sufficient?
[09:18.470 --> 09:20.470]  No, no, one is sufficient.
[09:20.470 --> 09:22.470]  One is sufficient.
[09:22.470 --> 09:24.470]  I didn't get the first one.
[09:24.470 --> 09:30.470]  Someone asked if the Mystery Machine seeds that were sent as freebies were Femme
[09:30.470 --> 09:32.470]  and they are not.
[09:32.470 --> 09:34.470]  They are regular seeds.
[09:34.470 --> 09:36.470]  It's a Juicy Fruit x Volunteer.
[09:36.470 --> 09:38.470]  That's going to be some interesting ones.
[09:38.710 --> 09:44.710]  I always have plants in my backyard, so a volunteer came up and I had a Juicy Fruit plant back there.
[09:44.710 --> 09:46.710]  So we'll see what happens.
[09:46.710 --> 09:52.710]  All right, Von D, hit up, give them the email address to pick up.
[09:52.710 --> 09:54.710]  What did he win, by the way?
[09:54.710 --> 09:56.710]  A pack of Loud Jelly Bellies.
[09:56.710 --> 09:58.710]  Got it.
[09:58.710 --> 10:04.750]  All right, so Von D, are we clear on what you need to do next?
[10:04.990 --> 10:10.990]  And actually, we have Sir Lancelot giveaway.
[10:10.990 --> 10:12.990]  How's it going, Lance?
[10:12.990 --> 10:14.990]  What is up?
[10:14.990 --> 10:16.990]  How's it going, James?
[10:16.990 --> 10:18.990]  Good to see you.
[10:18.990 --> 10:20.990]  How's your holiday been, dude?
[10:20.990 --> 10:22.990]  I didn't know you were talking about this Lance, Peter.
[10:22.990 --> 10:24.990]  That's so funny.
[10:24.990 --> 10:26.990]  Lance and I have had some good times in Spain, man.
[10:26.990 --> 10:28.990]  Yeah, for sure, for sure.
[10:28.990 --> 10:30.990]  Definitely good times.
[10:30.990 --> 10:32.990]  Man, it's been great.
[10:33.230 --> 10:35.230]  I'm going to miss it eventually.
[10:35.230 --> 10:37.230]  Unfortunately, I'm gone to curbside.
[10:37.230 --> 10:39.230]  So hopefully next year, man.
[10:39.230 --> 10:47.230]  Yeah, it's funny because that interview that I did with you in Spain was still one of the best ones I've ever done that wasn't recorded.
[10:47.230 --> 10:51.230]  Yeah, we need to do that again.
[10:51.230 --> 10:53.230]  Yeah, we definitely do because that was a good conversation.
[10:53.230 --> 10:55.230]  We need to get you in the same state of mind.
[10:55.230 --> 10:57.230]  Yeah.
[10:57.230 --> 10:59.230]  We could do that.
[10:59.230 --> 11:01.230]  I'm hoping that, I mean, I don't think it's going to happen this year.
[11:01.470 --> 11:03.470]  I don't know about you, James, but I think it's just too close with the pandemic and everything.
[11:03.470 --> 11:07.470]  I don't think Spanibus is going to, or if it does, it'll probably be a ratcheted back iteration.
[11:07.470 --> 11:15.470]  But man, I'd love to recreate that because that is, I tell people, we talk about it in this tangent for those that are less familiar with the industry.
[11:15.470 --> 11:17.470]  Here's a couple of big shows that we get excited about.
[11:17.470 --> 11:19.470]  One is MJ Biz out in Las Vegas.
[11:19.470 --> 11:27.470]  And that's where the suits go, which traditionally, the guys that James and I grew up with that we thought were either the feds or lawyers or investors.
[11:27.470 --> 11:29.470]  But that's where the suits go.
[11:29.710 --> 11:31.710]  And ironically, everyone's out there to party.
[11:31.710 --> 11:33.710]  I don't see much business happening in Vegas.
[11:33.710 --> 11:39.710]  And then on the flip side, you have the biggest, I guess you'd call it protestable, but same turnout.
[11:39.710 --> 11:43.710]  About 50,000 people come out for Spanibus in Barcelona every year.
[11:43.710 --> 11:47.710]  And even though a vast majority are consumers, that's where we get the most business done.
[11:47.710 --> 11:49.710]  Wouldn't you agree?
[11:49.710 --> 11:51.710]  I mean, James, you're busy, man.
[11:51.710 --> 11:53.710]  You're busy out there, too.
[11:53.710 --> 11:55.710]  Yeah.
[11:55.710 --> 11:57.710]  And I think we were about to launch a seed company with the Ganja Farmer Seed Company and some other stuff out there.
[11:57.950 --> 11:59.950]  And that's been on hold.
[11:59.950 --> 12:01.950]  But yeah, Spanibus is one of the biggest.
[12:01.950 --> 12:07.950]  And I think a lot of the stuff happens at the show and also behind the curtains at dinner parties.
[12:07.950 --> 12:09.950]  It's just everyone from around the world.
[12:09.950 --> 12:13.950]  I love Spanibus because I get to see my friends from around the world that I don't normally see every year otherwise.
[12:13.950 --> 12:15.950]  Exactly.
[12:15.950 --> 12:17.950]  That's what I was telling Peter, man.
[12:17.950 --> 12:19.950]  That's going to be a part of the show.
[12:19.950 --> 12:21.950]  We're kicking off a new show here.
[12:21.950 --> 12:25.950]  I don't think we've officially announced it in this space, but it's going to be called Seed to Social.
[12:26.190 --> 12:30.190]  And a big premise of that, to your point, is talking to our international network.
[12:30.190 --> 12:34.190]  Of course, I'm going to love to have you on because, to your point, although it didn't end up getting recorded,
[12:34.190 --> 12:42.190]  we're having some great conversations about those from Spain and from the West Coast coming together on some great genetics.
[12:42.190 --> 12:44.190]  And it was just a phenomenal conversation.
[12:44.190 --> 12:46.190]  So those are the kind of convos we want to have.
[12:46.190 --> 12:48.190]  But the whole idea is...
[12:48.190 --> 12:50.190]  With a new camera crew next year.
[12:50.190 --> 12:52.190]  Yes.
[12:52.190 --> 12:54.190]  With a different audio technician.
[12:54.430 --> 12:56.430]  Exactly.
[12:56.430 --> 12:58.430]  But, yeah, I definitely love the international scene.
[12:58.430 --> 13:00.430]  Well, hey, I'm here to give something away.
[13:00.430 --> 13:02.430]  So, yet again, I have another Caligo.
[13:02.430 --> 13:04.430]  This is a $50 retail silicone bong from our friends at Peacemaker.
[13:04.430 --> 13:06.430]  Speaking of Spanibus, they have actually an office based out of Barcelona.
[13:06.430 --> 13:08.430]  So props out to Nico and Matt Swisher out there in Barcelona.
[13:08.430 --> 13:10.430]  The Caligo is a phenomenal piece.
[13:10.430 --> 13:12.430]  Again, you guys, a lot of us have our glass at home.
[13:12.430 --> 13:14.430]  I've got my red dragon.
[13:14.430 --> 13:16.430]  I've got my red dragon.
[13:16.430 --> 13:18.430]  I've got my red dragon.
[13:18.430 --> 13:20.430]  I've got my red dragon.
[13:20.430 --> 13:22.430]  I've got my red dragon.
[13:22.670 --> 13:24.670]  So I've got a lot of glass at home.
[13:24.670 --> 13:26.670]  I've got my red dragon.
[13:26.670 --> 13:28.670]  I've got my Prometheus from Pype Tech.
[13:28.670 --> 13:30.670]  I've got some really high-end stuff
[13:30.670 --> 13:32.670]  that I love to keep here at home safe.
[13:32.670 --> 13:34.670]  But something I've learned in travels.
[13:34.670 --> 13:36.670]  And I know James will agree.
[13:36.670 --> 13:38.670]  We run into friends from Australia,
[13:38.670 --> 13:40.670]  from South America, from Europe.
[13:40.670 --> 13:42.670]  And they're always packing silicone
[13:42.670 --> 13:44.670]  and plastic grinders and all this.
[13:44.670 --> 13:46.670]  And I know about you, James.
[13:46.670 --> 13:48.670]  I bought you a Santa Cruz.
[13:48.670 --> 13:50.670]  I bought you a Mendo Molte when you came out to visit.
[13:50.670 --> 13:54.470]  So oftentimes they'll use stuff that's more realistic
[13:54.470 --> 13:57.930]  for on the road and definitely silicon fits that as well.
[13:57.930 --> 14:00.390]  And as James mentioned, you can use this, you know
[14:00.390 --> 14:01.510]  to stir your spaghetti too
[14:01.510 --> 14:03.230]  if you get caught in a grind while camping.
[14:03.230 --> 14:05.710]  So definitely a killer piece.
[14:05.710 --> 14:08.230]  Just so happens that the cap fills as a sealer
[14:08.230 --> 14:12.170]  to your favorite beer or alcoholic beverage
[14:12.170 --> 14:13.270]  which is kind of cool.
[14:13.270 --> 14:16.430]  But it's a nice piece, really nice and simple.
[14:16.430 --> 14:17.630]  It gets too gummed up.
[14:17.630 --> 14:20.050]  The cool thing too is you literally throw it in the freezer.
[14:20.050 --> 14:22.250]  You take it out and you crackle it up
[14:22.250 --> 14:24.370]  and all of a sudden all of your residue is gone.
[14:24.370 --> 14:26.930]  So a really nice piece.
[14:26.930 --> 14:30.490]  I think you probably have a question for this, right Peter?
[14:30.490 --> 14:31.650]  On how someone can win it.
[14:31.650 --> 14:34.290]  Yeah, so I thought it would be fun
[14:34.290 --> 14:36.850]  to have a bunch of dudes Googling.
[14:37.690 --> 14:39.090]  Here's the question.
[14:39.090 --> 14:40.290]  First person to answer,
[14:40.290 --> 14:44.970]  what was the name of the Spice Girls debut album in 1996?
[14:44.970 --> 14:45.810]  Oh wow.
[14:45.810 --> 14:48.850]  So the first person to answer that question.
[14:49.690 --> 14:54.690]  And hope that your girlfriends and wives and kids
[14:54.970 --> 14:56.810]  don't go through your search history
[14:56.810 --> 14:58.610]  because that's a little weird.
[14:59.730 --> 15:00.930]  At least you didn't make them search
[15:00.930 --> 15:02.930]  for what blue waffle means or something like that.
[15:02.930 --> 15:04.850]  Oh my gosh, yeah.
[15:04.850 --> 15:06.050]  Or the winking raisin.
[15:06.050 --> 15:07.850]  So keep it clean.
[15:09.610 --> 15:11.050]  And this too can be yours.
[15:11.050 --> 15:13.090]  And we ship out in lightning speed, you guys.
[15:13.090 --> 15:15.930]  So the winner, as long as you get the address to Peter
[15:15.930 --> 15:17.770]  by end of day today, obviously it is Sunday
[15:17.770 --> 15:21.770]  but we'll get it out first thing tomorrow via USPS.
[15:21.770 --> 15:24.690]  So let us know who the winner is
[15:24.690 --> 15:26.130]  and we'll be doing a lot of-
[15:26.130 --> 15:30.370]  So I think there were actually a bunch of wrong
[15:30.370 --> 15:32.610]  but very close answers.
[15:32.610 --> 15:34.050]  So I'm just trying to see if,
[15:34.050 --> 15:36.770]  oh no, sorry, Brandon Vizzle, I see you.
[15:36.770 --> 15:38.170]  Johnny Summers, all right.
[15:38.170 --> 15:40.210]  We have some, all right, hold on.
[15:40.210 --> 15:41.410]  Now let me just see who did it first.
[15:41.410 --> 15:43.490]  So the correct answer was Spice.
[15:44.490 --> 15:46.650]  And I think the first person
[15:46.650 --> 15:50.050]  and other people can yell at me if I'm wrong.
[15:50.050 --> 15:51.650]  No, we're man, who cares?
[15:51.650 --> 15:54.810]  That is true, but that's not gonna win you
[15:54.810 --> 15:58.090]  the fabulous green bomb.
[15:58.090 --> 16:01.690]  So City Soul Shine, I see you answered Spice.
[16:01.690 --> 16:03.810]  Did anyone answer it before you?
[16:05.650 --> 16:07.970]  All right, I'm going with City Soul Shine
[16:07.970 --> 16:10.130]  and you guys can tell me if I'm wrong, but.
[16:10.250 --> 16:11.570]  So City Soul Shine-
[16:11.570 --> 16:14.170]  Is my mic soft or,
[16:14.170 --> 16:16.490]  cause someone said speak into the, oh, it is soft.
[16:16.490 --> 16:17.850]  Yeah, your mic's a little soft.
[16:17.850 --> 16:18.850]  Is that louder?
[16:20.690 --> 16:21.530]  Not really.
[16:21.530 --> 16:24.370]  For Jason, that'll be great.
[16:24.370 --> 16:29.370]  All right, anyway, City Soul Shine, I now lost you.
[16:29.810 --> 16:31.410]  Oh wait, there you go, boom.
[16:31.410 --> 16:34.450]  City Soul Shine, someone's saying Jason came in first.
[16:34.450 --> 16:35.770]  Oh, Jason before-
[16:35.770 --> 16:38.130]  J-S-O-N, Jason.
[16:38.170 --> 16:39.730]  Let me scroll up.
[16:40.610 --> 16:42.690]  Oh yeah, Jason, sorry.
[16:42.690 --> 16:43.530]  Oh, Jason.
[16:43.530 --> 16:44.370]  Oops.
[16:45.850 --> 16:47.410]  Maybe we can do a runner up, Peter.
[16:47.410 --> 16:49.690]  We can do a, I've got a,
[16:50.810 --> 16:52.530]  I've always got one sitting around here.
[16:52.530 --> 16:54.970]  So while the Cali Go will go to Jason,
[16:54.970 --> 16:58.010]  we will give a, both of the branded Karma.
[16:58.010 --> 17:00.490]  This is one that I love taking up boarding
[17:00.490 --> 17:03.570]  because literally you can pre-pack it, cap it,
[17:03.570 --> 17:05.170]  smoke it halfway down the mountain,
[17:05.170 --> 17:10.170]  so this one is co-sponsored by our partners at Boveda.
[17:10.210 --> 17:12.090]  Never buy dry.
[17:12.090 --> 17:14.610]  Always gotta keep your stuff and your stash fresh.
[17:14.610 --> 17:16.490]  So we'll give the Karma to the runner up.
[17:16.490 --> 17:17.650]  So I'll get that mailed out to you.
[17:17.650 --> 17:21.170]  Also if Soul can send you his address or-
[17:21.170 --> 17:24.250]  Yeah, so if you guys can email me
[17:24.250 --> 17:26.770]  and I'll type in my email, get that out.
[17:26.770 --> 17:28.050]  All right, James, you got,
[17:28.050 --> 17:32.870]  well, do we have any breeding questions?
[17:32.870 --> 17:34.270]  I'm sure someone has something.
[17:35.830 --> 17:37.270]  I have a last comment before I go, dude.
[17:37.270 --> 17:39.990]  I love your recommendation on the mystery seeds, man,
[17:39.990 --> 17:41.750]  because I posted it up in the comments,
[17:41.750 --> 17:43.750]  but if my world travels,
[17:43.750 --> 17:45.950]  I don't have nearly a collection that you do,
[17:45.950 --> 17:46.950]  but if my world travels,
[17:46.950 --> 17:49.310]  I've got seeds from South Africa to Australia,
[17:49.310 --> 17:52.030]  South America, Europe, and I had a few mystery seeds.
[17:52.030 --> 17:53.550]  Someone throws it in a little baggie
[17:53.550 --> 17:55.190]  when you're on the road and forgets it.
[17:55.190 --> 17:57.510]  I've got seeds from South Africa to Australia,
[17:57.510 --> 17:59.950]  South America, Europe, and I had a few mystery seeds.
[17:59.950 --> 18:01.590]  Someone throws it in a little baggie
[18:01.630 --> 18:02.470]  when you're on the road
[18:02.470 --> 18:05.310]  and forgets to write the name or genetics on it.
[18:05.310 --> 18:07.390]  And that's what I did with this season.
[18:07.390 --> 18:08.590]  Literally, I popped mysteries.
[18:08.590 --> 18:11.270]  And the one that turned out best, the one that's a behemoth,
[18:11.270 --> 18:12.590]  I think it's a jacara.
[18:12.590 --> 18:13.990]  I'm calling it a headstrong haze
[18:13.990 --> 18:15.750]  because it's not quite pure,
[18:15.750 --> 18:17.790]  but I mean, the smell and the taste is there,
[18:17.790 --> 18:19.310]  but I agree, man.
[18:19.310 --> 18:20.990]  I think the mystery makes it fun.
[18:20.990 --> 18:24.070]  And especially if you're a grower, it really pushes you
[18:24.070 --> 18:25.870]  because all of a sudden you don't have the cheat sheet
[18:25.870 --> 18:28.390]  on what the best way about going
[18:28.390 --> 18:30.550]  and growing that genetic is.
[18:30.550 --> 18:32.910]  So I definitely, I agree with you
[18:32.910 --> 18:34.710]  on being keen to the mystery seeds
[18:34.710 --> 18:36.830]  and just taking a chance and seeing what works, man.
[18:36.830 --> 18:37.670]  That was awesome.
[18:37.670 --> 18:40.790]  So props to the recommendation there.
[18:40.790 --> 18:41.790]  Yeah, there's something to be said
[18:41.790 --> 18:42.910]  for the element of surprise.
[18:42.910 --> 18:44.790]  You know, I think, you know,
[18:44.790 --> 18:46.230]  there's intentional breeding
[18:46.230 --> 18:47.630]  and then there's that element of surprise
[18:47.630 --> 18:49.350]  and there's something special
[18:49.350 --> 18:51.150]  because it's not like you open it,
[18:51.150 --> 18:52.670]  you know, you find out what it is.
[18:52.670 --> 18:55.030]  It takes 90 days, you know,
[18:55.030 --> 18:57.470]  and maybe at least 60 days before you can tell
[18:57.470 --> 19:00.070]  if it might even be good.
[19:00.110 --> 19:01.470]  So.
[19:01.470 --> 19:02.310]  Yeah, very true.
[19:02.310 --> 19:03.910]  Handful were autos, which not knocking.
[19:03.910 --> 19:05.270]  I'm just, I'm an old school guy,
[19:05.270 --> 19:08.230]  but you know, a couple of them were autos
[19:08.230 --> 19:09.070]  and that was fine too.
[19:09.070 --> 19:10.310]  But yeah, I thought it was really neat.
[19:10.310 --> 19:12.190]  You know, it was nice to just to be able to,
[19:12.190 --> 19:13.750]  and I'm an outdoor grower anyway,
[19:13.750 --> 19:15.070]  so there's enough challenges we face,
[19:15.070 --> 19:16.910]  but I thought that was kind of cool.
[19:16.910 --> 19:18.990]  So props to everyone watching
[19:18.990 --> 19:22.350]  and congratulations again to both winners.
[19:22.350 --> 19:24.630]  So just quickly Lance, before you go,
[19:24.630 --> 19:28.550]  we have a question that you may be the house expert on.
[19:28.550 --> 19:29.790]  Yep, definitely.
[19:30.470 --> 19:31.990]  The best RH for Boveda.
[19:33.070 --> 19:33.990]  Interesting question.
[19:33.990 --> 19:36.950]  So most of us and James probably has his opinion too,
[19:36.950 --> 19:38.950]  it's depending on how you grow,
[19:38.950 --> 19:41.790]  but I typically keep my RHs lower.
[19:41.790 --> 19:43.630]  I'm a fan of the,
[19:43.630 --> 19:47.670]  they have a 58 and a 62% relative humidity from Boveda
[19:47.670 --> 19:50.830]  and the 62 is fine, but it's just a little too wet.
[19:50.830 --> 19:52.270]  Obviously it's not literally wet,
[19:52.270 --> 19:54.190]  but just the moisture content is a little too high
[19:54.190 --> 19:55.710]  on the grind in my opinion.
[19:55.710 --> 19:57.430]  I know some guys that do like it
[19:57.430 --> 19:59.670]  when they're into vaping rather than be volcano
[20:00.510 --> 20:02.150]  or G-Pen, et cetera.
[20:02.150 --> 20:05.150]  But for me, I typically go with the 58,
[20:05.990 --> 20:07.310]  put it straight into 58.
[20:07.310 --> 20:09.310]  So after I'm done with Cure, just to preserve it,
[20:09.310 --> 20:11.350]  I've got my jars with 58 right now,
[20:11.350 --> 20:13.470]  along with their, they've got a little,
[20:13.470 --> 20:15.070]  they call it the Boveda Butler,
[20:15.070 --> 20:18.270]  which is a cool little piece of technology
[20:18.270 --> 20:20.030]  that literally it has an app
[20:20.030 --> 20:21.910]  and I can pull up on my phone at any time
[20:21.910 --> 20:24.710]  with the relative humidity, with the temperature,
[20:24.710 --> 20:26.670]  and if anyone's touched my stash.
[20:26.670 --> 20:29.590]  So technology for Boveda,
[20:30.510 --> 20:31.350]  but they have a 58.
[20:31.350 --> 20:32.710]  I've been talking to them ever since
[20:32.710 --> 20:35.750]  before I went to work for them and no longer do.
[20:35.750 --> 20:38.070]  I'm coming out with a 50% because again,
[20:38.070 --> 20:40.070]  if someone's trying to fine tune their cure or something,
[20:40.070 --> 20:42.390]  even getting a little bit lower is advantageous.
[20:42.390 --> 20:45.190]  So they've been working on a 50%
[20:45.190 --> 20:46.830]  but trying to get the formula just right
[20:46.830 --> 20:49.870]  for that lifey and longterm lasting
[20:49.870 --> 20:51.470]  because that's where they do come ahead
[20:51.470 --> 20:54.830]  of anything else around the market is the longevity.
[20:54.830 --> 20:56.910]  So I would definitely recommend the 58,
[20:56.910 --> 20:59.230]  especially if you're grinding up and throwing it in,
[20:59.910 --> 21:00.750]  throwing it in a pipe or doing something
[21:00.750 --> 21:03.270]  a little more conventional by ways of consumption.
[21:03.270 --> 21:06.470]  When would you wanna bring it down to 50%?
[21:06.470 --> 21:08.790]  So for 50%, sometimes,
[21:08.790 --> 21:11.630]  you know, I'm a little too aggressive on the dry
[21:11.630 --> 21:14.670]  because I just wanna get it straight into the cure.
[21:14.670 --> 21:17.910]  So a lot of guys, if they just take it too dry,
[21:17.910 --> 21:19.270]  or again, if they're cure,
[21:19.270 --> 21:21.510]  if they're not staying on top of their cure,
[21:21.510 --> 21:23.350]  they'll introduce, you know,
[21:23.350 --> 21:25.470]  something to try to compensate for that.
[21:25.470 --> 21:28.630]  And that's where you really wanna, in my opinion,
[21:29.070 --> 21:32.350]  maintain around a 50 to 55% is around, you know,
[21:32.350 --> 21:34.590]  through your curing and longterm storage.
[21:34.590 --> 21:35.830]  Like I said, they're 58.
[21:35.830 --> 21:38.270]  I mean, mine typically hovers around 57, 58.
[21:38.270 --> 21:39.990]  You're only talking about a few points of differential
[21:39.990 --> 21:40.990]  and relative humidity.
[21:40.990 --> 21:44.150]  It's semantics, you know, anything below 60,
[21:44.150 --> 21:45.230]  I think you're golden.
[21:45.230 --> 21:47.070]  But I introduce them traditionally,
[21:47.070 --> 21:48.110]  if you're doing everything right,
[21:48.110 --> 21:49.470]  you introduce it after the cure.
[21:49.470 --> 21:51.670]  Some guys actually cure with Boveda
[21:51.670 --> 21:54.110]  just because they don't wanna babysit as much
[21:54.110 --> 21:56.270]  when it comes to relative humidity in your containers
[21:56.310 --> 21:59.350]  or your turkey bags or whatever your protocol is
[21:59.350 --> 22:02.590]  for processing post cultivation.
[22:02.590 --> 22:05.310]  So it's definitely something that's a personal preference,
[22:05.310 --> 22:07.990]  but most favor the lower RH.
[22:07.990 --> 22:11.270]  And would you agree with Kevin Jodry?
[22:11.270 --> 22:16.270]  Kevin's having, my gosh, dude, his house must be crazy.
[22:17.270 --> 22:21.670]  He's having his first Christmas with his newborn, man.
[22:21.670 --> 22:22.510]  I would agree.
[22:22.510 --> 22:24.270]  I like posh, I like posh, a little high maintenance.
[22:24.310 --> 22:25.990]  I kind of favor Sporty Spice
[22:25.990 --> 22:27.870]  because I'm a little more just kind of
[22:27.870 --> 22:29.270]  girl next door type of guy.
[22:29.270 --> 22:30.110]  So I would-
[22:30.110 --> 22:31.350]  Wait, sorry, which one?
[22:31.350 --> 22:32.390]  Sporty Spice.
[22:35.820 --> 22:36.660]  What was it?
[22:36.660 --> 22:39.380]  Mel B, weren't there two Mel's?
[22:39.380 --> 22:41.220]  Mel B and Mel.
[22:41.220 --> 22:42.540]  Oh yeah, there's Sporty Spice.
[22:42.540 --> 22:43.700]  Oh my gosh.
[22:43.700 --> 22:45.180]  You guys are taking us back to the 90s.
[22:45.180 --> 22:47.820]  It's all of our high school years or college years.
[22:49.780 --> 22:53.980]  Just quickly in terms of people going into your stash
[22:53.980 --> 22:56.540]  and getting an alert, how old's your son right now?
[22:57.620 --> 23:00.700]  How many more years before he's like-
[23:00.700 --> 23:03.340]  Yeah, so my son's nine and a half,
[23:03.340 --> 23:04.780]  but I've taken a different approach.
[23:04.780 --> 23:08.540]  And maybe I know yours are a little young still, Peter,
[23:08.540 --> 23:10.180]  but I took a different approach to my son.
[23:10.180 --> 23:12.220]  He's been very aware, cognitively aware,
[23:12.220 --> 23:13.460]  because being a medical advocate,
[23:13.460 --> 23:14.940]  being out of the green closet,
[23:14.940 --> 23:17.980]  as I say, for several years now, I've educated him.
[23:17.980 --> 23:19.580]  So he understands that it's medicine,
[23:19.580 --> 23:21.980]  but it's medicine that's only to be consumed by adults,
[23:21.980 --> 23:23.580]  unless under extreme circumstances.
[23:24.180 --> 23:27.180]  That's why I explain grand mal seizures, epileptic seizures.
[23:27.180 --> 23:29.580]  There's exceptions where children use cannabis.
[23:29.580 --> 23:31.140]  But the funny thing is,
[23:31.140 --> 23:32.940]  and I think I might've told you this story,
[23:32.940 --> 23:34.900]  working for Weedmaps for years,
[23:34.900 --> 23:37.580]  those guys, they have the flower all over everything.
[23:37.580 --> 23:41.060]  So when he was younger, every time he saw the cannabis leaf,
[23:41.060 --> 23:43.260]  he was always like, daddy, it's your company.
[23:44.820 --> 23:45.980]  Well, it's not my company.
[23:45.980 --> 23:49.780]  It's just the companies that I work for.
[23:49.780 --> 23:51.300]  That's the industry they're in.
[23:51.300 --> 23:52.860]  So he definitely gets it now.
[23:52.900 --> 23:54.620]  He's been out there.
[23:54.620 --> 23:57.100]  He watches me trim, he watches me process,
[23:57.100 --> 23:58.900]  and I educate him all along the way.
[23:58.900 --> 23:59.740]  And that's what it is.
[23:59.740 --> 24:02.260]  You guys know, and James is the same way.
[24:02.260 --> 24:04.540]  Leading with education, no matter if it's-
[24:04.540 --> 24:05.380]  Yeah, I know.
[24:05.380 --> 24:08.020]  I used to love, like with Gemma,
[24:08.020 --> 24:12.620]  I'd have her take clones, like I'd have a turbo cloner,
[24:12.620 --> 24:14.060]  and I'd have her take the clones
[24:14.060 --> 24:16.260]  and then put them into the soil.
[24:16.260 --> 24:18.300]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:18.300 --> 24:19.140]  Actually, he was like-
[24:19.140 --> 24:22.100]  Teaching her about how plants eat their food with the roots.
[24:22.100 --> 24:23.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[24:23.460 --> 24:25.500]  And that was, and he even labeled,
[24:25.500 --> 24:26.980]  again, sorry, I'm dating myself.
[24:26.980 --> 24:30.300]  I don't use, I'm all about starting out in the closet
[24:30.300 --> 24:32.780]  to the Dixie cups, and then from the cups to the bags,
[24:32.780 --> 24:34.060]  bags to the ground.
[24:34.060 --> 24:35.860]  And by the time they get to the cups,
[24:35.860 --> 24:37.500]  he's always like, okay, this one's mine.
[24:37.500 --> 24:38.980]  He's looking to see which one's tallest.
[24:38.980 --> 24:41.340]  Because he always wants to get the biggest one.
[24:41.340 --> 24:42.420]  So he helps me out along the way.
[24:42.420 --> 24:44.620]  But again, I think educating, because,
[24:44.620 --> 24:46.340]  and again, I know James, you saw this.
[24:46.340 --> 24:50.180]  Like no matter if I was in Santiago, Chile,
[24:50.180 --> 24:53.460]  or Prague in the Czech Republic, or Barcelona,
[24:53.460 --> 24:54.540]  I'd go to these events,
[24:54.540 --> 24:57.340]  and there would actually be families there.
[24:57.340 --> 25:01.220]  And they would have temporary childcare on site
[25:01.220 --> 25:02.140]  for these children,
[25:02.140 --> 25:04.260]  because they treat it like a real industry.
[25:04.260 --> 25:06.100]  There's no taboo or stigma.
[25:06.100 --> 25:07.420]  This is what we're doing.
[25:07.420 --> 25:09.860]  And these people have families,
[25:09.860 --> 25:10.980]  and these people have children,
[25:10.980 --> 25:12.940]  and this is their livelihood.
[25:12.940 --> 25:14.620]  And so that really influenced me
[25:14.620 --> 25:16.460]  to not keep it in the closet,
[25:16.500 --> 25:20.500]  and not keep it as a secret from my son.
[25:20.500 --> 25:22.700]  The neighbors, I have a couple of cool neighbors.
[25:22.700 --> 25:24.740]  I have a couple of conservative neighbors.
[25:24.740 --> 25:25.740]  That's kind of another story.
[25:25.740 --> 25:28.500]  But the more it becomes mainstream,
[25:28.500 --> 25:30.140]  obviously the less stigma and tabooism.
[25:30.140 --> 25:31.140]  And all of us make a difference.
[25:31.140 --> 25:33.340]  Everything that we do, all of us included,
[25:33.340 --> 25:34.180]  makes a difference.
[25:34.180 --> 25:35.380]  So good stuff.
[25:36.980 --> 25:38.220]  Definitely.
[25:38.220 --> 25:39.460]  Well, thanks for coming on, Lance.
[25:39.460 --> 25:40.860]  It's been great seeing you.
[25:40.860 --> 25:41.980]  Always great watching you guys.
[25:41.980 --> 25:43.260]  I'll go back to the big screen,
[25:43.260 --> 25:45.740]  and have a good rest of your holidays.
[25:45.780 --> 25:46.620]  Happy New Year's.
[25:46.620 --> 25:49.740]  Here's to 2021, which we hope will be a better one.
[25:49.740 --> 25:52.500]  And Lance, I will give you a call tomorrow.
[25:52.500 --> 25:53.340]  Okay, perfect, man.
[25:53.340 --> 25:54.180]  I'll be around.
[25:54.180 --> 25:55.020]  Thank you, guys.
[25:55.020 --> 25:55.860]  See ya.
[25:55.860 --> 25:56.700]  Have a good one.
[25:56.700 --> 25:58.140]  Bye-bye.
[25:58.140 --> 26:03.140]  Okay, so we did have a breeding question a while ago.
[26:03.180 --> 26:06.220]  Your preferred way of collecting pollen.
[26:06.220 --> 26:08.980]  Oh, man, there's a ton of different ways to collect pollen.
[26:08.980 --> 26:12.900]  But I've done everything from use parchment
[26:12.900 --> 26:15.220]  on smaller plants where you can wrap it and collect it.
[26:15.740 --> 26:16.580]  You can shake it down in there.
[26:16.580 --> 26:21.380]  To shaking it on a sheet pan that they use
[26:21.380 --> 26:22.220]  for in the kitchens.
[26:22.220 --> 26:25.700]  You know, being a chef in my past life
[26:25.700 --> 26:26.660]  and still loving cooking,
[26:26.660 --> 26:27.860]  I have a lot of cooking equipment.
[26:27.860 --> 26:31.540]  But hotel pans or sheet pans with parchment on there,
[26:31.540 --> 26:33.340]  you can shake it right over the top.
[26:33.340 --> 26:34.300]  The pollen will fall down.
[26:34.300 --> 26:35.340]  A lot of it will fall down.
[26:35.340 --> 26:37.420]  Some of it just goes out in the air.
[26:37.420 --> 26:38.780]  But you can take that.
[26:38.780 --> 26:41.860]  You can then put it in mason jars.
[26:41.860 --> 26:43.260]  You can blend it with rice.
[26:43.260 --> 26:47.820]  I prefer rice flour as opposed to normal flour.
[26:47.820 --> 26:52.060]  I feel like I like rice flour better personally.
[26:52.060 --> 26:53.620]  But, and it's gluten-free.
[26:53.620 --> 26:56.500]  So, but yeah, that's a great way.
[26:56.500 --> 26:58.300]  And then storing them in the fridge
[26:58.300 --> 27:01.340]  if you're using them right away or in the freezer.
[27:01.340 --> 27:03.940]  50% flour is a great mix.
[27:03.940 --> 27:05.780]  You can put rice in there.
[27:05.780 --> 27:08.620]  But I would let it dry out before you close it.
[27:08.620 --> 27:12.340]  Make sure it's fully dry, whatever you're using.
[27:12.340 --> 27:15.620]  That's another thing with just a tip right now for seeds.
[27:15.620 --> 27:18.540]  I have a friend that up in Washington
[27:18.540 --> 27:19.660]  that made a whole bunch of seeds
[27:19.660 --> 27:21.620]  and he put them in a five gallon bucket
[27:21.620 --> 27:23.580]  and put them in the fridge right away.
[27:23.580 --> 27:25.740]  Well, don't refrigerate your seeds right away.
[27:25.740 --> 27:28.220]  They need to dry out in a paper bag for,
[27:28.220 --> 27:30.100]  I would say a minimum of a month
[27:30.100 --> 27:32.940]  before you definitely think about putting them in the fridge.
[27:32.940 --> 27:34.660]  Did they all start sprouting or something or what happened?
[27:34.660 --> 27:37.620]  No, so what happened is in that situation
[27:37.620 --> 27:40.660]  where he refrigerated them, the germination rate went down.
[27:40.660 --> 27:45.020]  So he went from a 99 to 100% germination rate,
[27:45.020 --> 27:47.580]  somewhere in between that down to 50%.
[27:47.580 --> 27:51.380]  And so that's huge, that devalues the seeds extremely
[27:51.380 --> 27:53.820]  because not only would you have to give someone more seeds,
[27:53.820 --> 27:54.780]  but you would also,
[27:54.780 --> 27:57.060]  most people wouldn't wanna have to deal with that.
[27:57.060 --> 27:59.580]  So make sure you dry your seeds out.
[27:59.580 --> 28:04.580]  No, I mean, we're talking about bulk seeds,
[28:04.620 --> 28:07.700]  the price on bulk seeds, you're not getting that much anyway.
[28:07.700 --> 28:09.140]  So then it goes down
[28:09.140 --> 28:11.780]  and a lot of people wouldn't even wanna buy them.
[28:11.780 --> 28:13.740]  So we got another question,
[28:13.740 --> 28:15.700]  how diverse are African genetics
[28:15.700 --> 28:17.860]  like type of things found in the Congo
[28:17.860 --> 28:19.940]  compared to Ethiopia?
[28:19.940 --> 28:21.820]  Well, Africa is a huge continent.
[28:21.820 --> 28:24.740]  So if you think of it like that, there's mountainous regions,
[28:24.740 --> 28:27.180]  there's all kinds of geographic locations.
[28:27.180 --> 28:28.780]  So there is a lot of diverse genetics,
[28:28.780 --> 28:30.540]  just like there is,
[28:30.540 --> 28:33.700]  if we're talking about land race genetics,
[28:33.700 --> 28:37.900]  stuff that is, or indigenous genetics,
[28:37.940 --> 28:39.500]  you're gonna get a bunch of diversity.
[28:39.500 --> 28:41.940]  You're gonna get a bunch of diversity in terpene profiles.
[28:41.940 --> 28:44.260]  I mean, just even from the African stuff
[28:44.260 --> 28:46.540]  that we have over here,
[28:46.540 --> 28:49.620]  which would be like Durban poison,
[28:49.620 --> 28:51.420]  which is from Durban originally,
[28:51.420 --> 28:53.940]  which was bred with super silver haze,
[28:53.940 --> 28:56.580]  as opposed to red Congolese, very different,
[28:56.580 --> 28:57.980]  both extremely strong smoke.
[28:57.980 --> 28:59.020]  I don't know if you guys saw the,
[28:59.020 --> 29:01.740]  where Alfred, Master Yoda and I smoked
[29:01.740 --> 29:02.740]  some of that red Congolese,
[29:02.740 --> 29:06.420]  but that stuff is strong, super potent.
[29:06.420 --> 29:08.020]  Same thing with the real Durban,
[29:08.020 --> 29:09.700]  real Durban is a ass kicker,
[29:10.700 --> 29:12.460]  but you will find stuff.
[29:12.460 --> 29:16.540]  And I mean, those are very varieties
[29:16.540 --> 29:18.420]  that I would say have that open bud structure
[29:18.420 --> 29:20.420]  we talk about that some people hate,
[29:20.420 --> 29:24.300]  some people love for more humid regions,
[29:24.300 --> 29:25.140]  they get taller.
[29:25.140 --> 29:26.660]  Some people say sativa,
[29:26.660 --> 29:29.540]  we can go narrow leaf drug varietal,
[29:29.540 --> 29:32.500]  which I believe is more of the true term.
[29:32.500 --> 29:35.020]  But someone else has a question about how,
[29:36.540 --> 29:38.020]  trying to do a quick pheno hunt,
[29:38.020 --> 29:41.780]  is it okay to take clone and flower the donors
[29:41.780 --> 29:43.300]  as soon as the clones root,
[29:43.300 --> 29:46.700]  or do you recommend flowering out the new clones?
[29:46.700 --> 29:49.620]  Well, there's, you can do either.
[29:49.620 --> 29:51.900]  I recommend flowering out the new clones.
[29:51.900 --> 29:54.580]  Sexual maturity comes into play
[29:54.580 --> 29:55.940]  when you're doing pheno hunts.
[29:55.940 --> 29:58.260]  And if you force that,
[29:58.260 --> 30:00.780]  you can basically force them to flower too quickly
[30:00.780 --> 30:03.380]  and you can have problems like intersexual traits
[30:03.380 --> 30:05.260]  because you can stress the plants out.
[30:05.260 --> 30:07.540]  But I think you're gonna get a better representation
[30:07.540 --> 30:11.860]  of the outcome if you're using clones for the longterm.
[30:11.860 --> 30:15.580]  I mean, I think you're gonna be using clones
[30:15.580 --> 30:17.020]  on clones on clones.
[30:17.020 --> 30:19.220]  And sometimes it takes three generations
[30:19.220 --> 30:22.420]  to get an actual idea of how the plant
[30:22.420 --> 30:26.300]  is gonna respond to different things like light and food
[30:26.300 --> 30:28.500]  and things like that.
[30:28.500 --> 30:31.700]  So using clones, saving those original moms,
[30:31.700 --> 30:32.780]  cutting the clones off,
[30:32.780 --> 30:35.140]  that's my opinion is the best way.
[30:36.020 --> 30:37.820]  If you're trying to cut down time,
[30:37.820 --> 30:42.380]  you can do whatever, but that's my opinion on that.
[30:43.300 --> 30:44.620]  So let's do another giveaway.
[30:44.620 --> 30:48.540]  We got my guys from Miami Mango.
[30:48.540 --> 30:49.380]  These guys are good homies.
[30:49.380 --> 30:50.580]  They always give me lots of free stuff.
[30:50.580 --> 30:52.820]  These right here, we got two sleeves.
[30:52.820 --> 30:54.580]  Now I got big arms.
[30:56.660 --> 30:57.980]  And these go on your arm.
[30:59.500 --> 31:01.220]  These actually fit my arms pretty well,
[31:01.220 --> 31:02.860]  but they got a little...
[31:02.900 --> 31:04.180]  So now when you're in your room,
[31:04.180 --> 31:07.660]  all that plant material that normally gives you
[31:07.660 --> 31:10.060]  bumps and itches, if you get bumps and itches,
[31:10.060 --> 31:10.900]  that goes away.
[31:10.900 --> 31:12.140]  And I think these things are genius.
[31:12.140 --> 31:13.940]  I'm glad somebody came out with them.
[31:13.940 --> 31:15.340]  I don't think that they invented them,
[31:15.340 --> 31:20.100]  but the idea and the fact that they're selling
[31:20.100 --> 31:23.940]  and marketing them, plucking amazing.
[31:23.940 --> 31:25.060]  So the question is-
[31:25.060 --> 31:27.140]  Yeah, until you explained that use case,
[31:27.140 --> 31:28.940]  I was like, I don't know many scenarios
[31:28.940 --> 31:32.340]  where I'd be reaching for a glove with a sleeve.
[31:33.100 --> 31:35.380]  Well, no, and the thing is, is a lot of us,
[31:35.380 --> 31:38.540]  I think cannabis, as I've gotten older,
[31:38.540 --> 31:39.860]  I've become more allergic to it.
[31:39.860 --> 31:42.180]  When I was younger, I used to be able to sleep
[31:42.180 --> 31:45.900]  with the trim tray next to me or on the nightstand
[31:45.900 --> 31:50.180]  and trim until I went to sleep and then picked it back up.
[31:50.180 --> 31:51.900]  I lived in an apartment with my friends when I was younger
[31:51.900 --> 31:54.300]  and we grew some plants and we trimmed some stuff.
[31:54.300 --> 31:55.820]  And we used to sleep next to plants.
[31:55.820 --> 31:58.300]  I had a plant right next to me in a closet
[31:58.300 --> 31:59.940]  and I had no allergies back then.
[31:59.940 --> 32:01.140]  But as I've gotten older,
[32:01.140 --> 32:03.340]  I'm more allergic to the plant material.
[32:03.340 --> 32:05.100]  Not everybody is, but some of us,
[32:05.100 --> 32:07.740]  and I think the more you're exposed to it,
[32:07.740 --> 32:09.220]  the more allergic you can become.
[32:09.220 --> 32:12.060]  So something like these sleeves is an asset
[32:12.060 --> 32:14.740]  to people who have to go in rooms a lot and do,
[32:14.740 --> 32:17.060]  if you're defanning, you're messing with plants,
[32:17.060 --> 32:20.300]  you're in the canopy, these sleeves are great.
[32:20.300 --> 32:22.860]  And let's see.
[32:22.860 --> 32:24.820]  So we need to come up with a question.
[32:24.820 --> 32:27.260]  So someone's, all right, yeah.
[32:27.260 --> 32:29.140]  You got any more fun questions, Peter?
[32:31.140 --> 32:32.340]  Yeah, give me a second.
[32:40.280 --> 32:41.200]  You wanna do a...
[32:43.240 --> 32:45.760]  Terp allergy, someone said terp allergy.
[32:45.760 --> 32:47.200]  I don't think I have a terp allergy.
[32:47.200 --> 32:48.760]  I think it's just a plant.
[32:48.760 --> 32:52.680]  I'm allergic to other things like sulfites.
[32:52.680 --> 32:54.960]  I'm allergic to grass.
[32:54.960 --> 32:58.120]  And so I think it's, you know, with the plant material,
[32:58.120 --> 32:59.880]  because I have no problem smoking,
[32:59.880 --> 33:03.080]  but when it comes to being around plant material,
[33:03.080 --> 33:06.040]  dry stuff, it gets me.
[33:06.680 --> 33:09.440]  So dry combs and turds, yep, they're natural repellent.
[33:11.840 --> 33:13.080]  Stella Blue.
[33:13.080 --> 33:17.320]  Okay, so I'm gonna try to find a good trivia question,
[33:17.320 --> 33:19.520]  and why don't you answer that one?
[33:20.400 --> 33:22.960]  So when a male plant makes pollen,
[33:22.960 --> 33:27.160]  is each pollen grain genetically identical to the father,
[33:27.160 --> 33:29.960]  or is there variation in the father's genetics,
[33:29.960 --> 33:32.040]  recombination during the process?
[33:33.040 --> 33:35.440]  It depends on how stable it is, I believe.
[33:35.440 --> 33:40.200]  So if I can read this right, genetically identical.
[33:40.200 --> 33:43.040]  So we have dominant and recessive traits,
[33:43.040 --> 33:46.080]  and it depends on homozygosity, I believe.
[33:46.080 --> 33:49.200]  So if we're talking about, you know, I wanna do a show.
[33:49.200 --> 33:50.480]  We have a guy named Benjamin
[33:50.480 --> 33:52.160]  who is commenting on some stuff,
[33:52.160 --> 33:53.800]  and we're gonna get him on here.
[33:53.800 --> 33:55.200]  I would like to get some other people,
[33:55.200 --> 33:57.640]  but if we're talking about homozygosity,
[33:57.640 --> 33:59.880]  if every grain of pollen,
[33:59.920 --> 34:03.320]  that every grain of pollen, if it's a homozygous plant, yes.
[34:03.320 --> 34:05.720]  If it's a heterozygous plant, no.
[34:06.560 --> 34:08.800]  There would be genetic diversity.
[34:08.800 --> 34:13.800]  And pretty, pretty straightforward with that.
[34:14.240 --> 34:15.920]  But yeah, I would like Ryan Lee,
[34:15.920 --> 34:17.960]  we're gonna try to get Ryan Lee on here one of these days.
[34:17.960 --> 34:21.600]  I don't know if you guys know Ryan Lee from Chimera.
[34:21.600 --> 34:23.680]  He is an expert in the field,
[34:23.680 --> 34:27.680]  and as far as he has a little bit of science,
[34:27.680 --> 34:29.740]  not even a little bit, but he has a lot of science,
[34:30.600 --> 34:33.460]  and he has a lot of understanding of popular genetics.
[34:34.500 --> 34:37.260]  Homo versus hetero, exactly.
[34:37.260 --> 34:41.340]  So S1 is as close as you can get to that pheno
[34:41.340 --> 34:42.600]  without a clone of it.
[34:44.100 --> 34:46.500]  S1, so yeah, I mean, basically yourself,
[34:46.500 --> 34:49.140]  when you're putting the gene pairs together
[34:49.140 --> 34:50.900]  from both of the plants, the same thing.
[34:50.900 --> 34:52.620]  So you're putting a plant on itself
[34:52.620 --> 34:54.500]  if we're talking about S1s.
[34:54.500 --> 34:56.300]  Now there is genetic diversity
[34:56.300 --> 34:58.380]  unless it's a homozygous plant.
[34:58.380 --> 34:59.800]  There's gonna be genetic diversity.
[34:59.800 --> 35:02.740]  So you will get different expressions.
[35:02.740 --> 35:05.340]  You will get different genotypes,
[35:05.340 --> 35:07.740]  and from the different genotypes,
[35:07.740 --> 35:10.460]  then you can select one that's close.
[35:10.460 --> 35:12.220]  You won't get, I think a lot of people think,
[35:12.220 --> 35:14.180]  oh, you put it on itself, you're gonna get the same thing.
[35:14.180 --> 35:15.780]  That's not necessarily true.
[35:15.780 --> 35:19.700]  You will get genetic diversity from selfing.
[35:19.700 --> 35:24.700]  So the more you self, you get some,
[35:25.540 --> 35:28.180]  basically genetic depression.
[35:28.180 --> 35:29.220]  Same thing with inbreeding.
[35:29.220 --> 35:32.020]  When you're inbreeding, you get genetic depression.
[35:32.020 --> 35:34.080]  That's what the beauty of heterosis is.
[35:34.080 --> 35:36.900]  You can basically make a plant more vigorous.
[35:38.060 --> 35:42.160]  So have you ever noticed that plant genetic traits
[35:42.160 --> 35:45.100]  are used appear on the F3 and F4
[35:45.100 --> 35:50.100]  more than the plant's genetic traits?
[35:50.340 --> 35:51.820]  You used appear more.
[35:51.820 --> 35:55.660]  I think there's some truth to that.
[35:55.660 --> 36:00.380]  F3 and F4, you definitely have genetic traits that appear.
[36:00.380 --> 36:03.700]  I think this kind of leads into someone else's question
[36:03.700 --> 36:07.180]  that was talking about how do you lock in the F2 traits?
[36:07.180 --> 36:10.060]  Basically, how do you lock in the traits
[36:10.060 --> 36:11.860]  that you're looking for in the F2?
[36:11.860 --> 36:14.340]  Well, I think one of the things you do with the F2
[36:14.340 --> 36:16.880]  is it depends on your goals.
[36:16.880 --> 36:18.100]  I mean, there's so many different things.
[36:18.100 --> 36:20.300]  If your goal is you find that F1
[36:21.140 --> 36:24.900]  in that cross once you take two, it's a F1 hybrid.
[36:24.900 --> 36:27.940]  And we're all breeding F1 hybrids here pretty much.
[36:27.940 --> 36:30.820]  So if you're taking two plants, you cross them together,
[36:30.820 --> 36:35.540]  you take Blue Dream and you take GDP, for example,
[36:35.540 --> 36:37.580]  and you cross those two things together,
[36:37.580 --> 36:39.640]  you have an F1 hybrid.
[36:39.640 --> 36:43.580]  Now with that F1 hybrid, you take those seeds
[36:43.580 --> 36:46.220]  and you find something you really like.
[36:46.220 --> 36:48.420]  Well, then what you try to do is you try to find a parent
[36:48.420 --> 36:51.820]  that's very similar in structure to it.
[36:51.820 --> 36:53.300]  You want something a little bit taller than it.
[36:53.300 --> 36:56.620]  As a male, the males tend to be a little bit taller
[36:56.620 --> 36:58.300]  if you're looking for something similar
[36:58.300 --> 37:01.360]  and you're not using any sort of breeding tools.
[37:01.360 --> 37:05.420]  Then you take, we're talking about similar branching,
[37:05.420 --> 37:09.620]  similar, you can look at the leaf patterns.
[37:09.620 --> 37:13.060]  You can see the blades on the leaf, the serrations,
[37:13.060 --> 37:15.060]  and you can find something that's similar.
[37:15.060 --> 37:15.980]  You breed those together.
[37:15.980 --> 37:18.400]  Then in the F2, it just depends on what you're trying
[37:19.240 --> 37:20.080]  to do.
[37:20.080 --> 37:20.900]  If you're trying to look for something new
[37:20.900 --> 37:21.840]  that might be better, that's typically what happens
[37:21.840 --> 37:24.040]  is you're trying to find something that's as good
[37:24.040 --> 37:26.280]  if not better when you pop within that progeny.
[37:26.280 --> 37:27.920]  So you pop those.
[37:27.920 --> 37:30.000]  And then what you're trying to do is you're trying
[37:30.000 --> 37:31.720]  to find that one that's similar.
[37:31.720 --> 37:35.120]  Now, the most important thing is to make sure
[37:35.120 --> 37:36.780]  you save seeds from everything that you do
[37:36.780 --> 37:38.320]  so you can backtrack.
[37:38.320 --> 37:41.600]  Because when you're taking the F2,
[37:41.600 --> 37:44.000]  unless you're gonna put that F2 back on itself,
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.480]  you're looking for something that's similar
[37:45.480 --> 37:48.520]  to put into the F3 so you can find it.
[37:48.520 --> 37:52.160]  You're looking for something that is a similar genotype
[37:52.160 --> 37:55.720]  that basically branches similarly.
[37:55.720 --> 38:00.720]  I do a lot of with branching and then leaf shape.
[38:01.080 --> 38:04.520]  Male plants, like I said, are a little bit taller typically.
[38:04.520 --> 38:06.780]  But in that F3, what you're trying to do
[38:06.780 --> 38:09.600]  is obviously find something that's towards
[38:09.600 --> 38:12.040]  your breeding goal, whatever that breeding goal is.
[38:15.040 --> 38:20.040]  So, pollen is how plants and genetic diversity
[38:20.080 --> 38:24.040]  so know for me, erectus.
[38:24.040 --> 38:26.240]  We're getting some really funny things here.
[38:27.360 --> 38:30.800]  Did you see the one, someone asked why are males taller?
[38:32.040 --> 38:32.880]  I don't know.
[38:32.880 --> 38:35.680]  In the real world, males are taller too.
[38:35.680 --> 38:40.280]  If you think about animals, if you think about humans,
[38:40.280 --> 38:43.320]  if you think that males, I'm sure there's a reason
[38:43.320 --> 38:45.760]  and I don't know the answer, but I know Rob Clark,
[38:45.760 --> 38:47.880]  I could ask him if there's a reason.
[38:47.880 --> 38:49.960]  I mean, maybe because they're spreading pollen
[38:49.960 --> 38:51.920]  to multiple plants.
[38:51.920 --> 38:54.880]  I mean, I'm sure there's a physiological reason
[38:54.880 --> 38:58.360]  why there's a benefit to having the male plants taller.
[39:00.360 --> 39:02.840]  But yeah, I mean, that's just typically
[39:02.840 --> 39:03.680]  goes across the board.
[39:03.680 --> 39:07.280]  Hormones, someone said hormones and I'm sure hormones
[39:07.280 --> 39:09.320]  and hormone distribution has something to do with it.
[39:09.320 --> 39:11.840]  But what is the exact reasoning?
[39:13.840 --> 39:15.480]  Sustainable genetics, isolating traits.
[39:15.480 --> 39:16.400]  I live for this stuff.
[39:16.400 --> 39:17.520]  Great info guys.
[39:17.520 --> 39:22.520]  All right, so I have our trivia question
[39:25.730 --> 39:30.090]  and mostly because I was watching the Celtics Lakers
[39:30.090 --> 39:35.090]  30 for 30 before we started.
[39:36.290 --> 39:39.450]  So how many NBAs and this is gonna come fast,
[39:39.450 --> 39:41.290]  so let me queue up the chat.
[39:41.290 --> 39:43.650]  How many first person NBA players
[39:44.010 --> 39:46.530]  how many first person to answer this correctly?
[39:46.530 --> 39:49.210]  How many NBA titles does Bill Russell have?
[39:58.500 --> 40:00.100]  Okay, no answers yet.
[40:01.500 --> 40:02.340]  There we go.
[40:02.340 --> 40:06.020]  Cosmic Pan, whoa, Cosmic Pandulin.
[40:07.220 --> 40:09.620]  Cosmic Pandulin, good God, where are you?
[40:09.620 --> 40:11.260]  All right, there we go.
[40:11.260 --> 40:15.540]  So Cosmic Pandulin and what did they win?
[40:16.540 --> 40:18.500]  They won some sleeves from Miami Mango.
[40:18.500 --> 40:20.660]  Oh, right, right, right, okay.
[40:20.660 --> 40:24.780]  So you can send James an email
[40:26.580 --> 40:29.460]  because you know your Boston sports history.
[40:29.460 --> 40:33.260]  If you guys wanna win lots of stuff in the future,
[40:33.260 --> 40:36.740]  know that I will skew towards Boston sports trivia.
[40:41.150 --> 40:44.510]  Okay, so we got a winner.
[40:44.510 --> 40:45.350]  We're all set.
[40:45.350 --> 40:46.470]  Well, who is the winner again?
[40:46.470 --> 40:49.030]  We're going, I'm writing this down.
[40:49.030 --> 40:50.670]  That I don't remember.
[40:50.670 --> 40:52.470]  Hold on, let me go way up.
[40:54.470 --> 40:57.150]  It was, if someone can help me out.
[40:58.670 --> 40:59.990]  This is a cannabis show, right?
[40:59.990 --> 41:02.430]  Yeah, sports questions, Peter, come on.
[41:03.670 --> 41:06.270]  Well, yeah, now we can do, we can, I mean,
[41:07.630 --> 41:09.590]  I figured we could move around, we could do music.
[41:09.590 --> 41:11.470]  I was actually, I have a good music one,
[41:11.470 --> 41:17.930]  but yeah, Cosmic Pandulin, Pangolin, Angelin.
[41:18.930 --> 41:20.730]  Pangolin, Angelin.
[41:25.640 --> 41:30.120]  Okay, so we need a loud can of Jenix.
[41:34.090 --> 41:35.490]  Let's see, loud can of Jenix.
[41:35.490 --> 41:37.530]  We're gonna give away some Dark Sunset.
[41:39.010 --> 41:41.170]  The mystery machine, someone asked again
[41:41.170 --> 41:43.050]  what the mystery machine.
[41:43.050 --> 41:47.050]  That was a juicy fruit times volunteer.
[41:48.530 --> 41:50.410]  So those would be fun.
[41:50.410 --> 41:52.690]  What happened in that scenario?
[41:54.210 --> 41:56.610]  Oh, so in my backyard, I'll tell it again,
[41:56.610 --> 41:58.490]  but in my backyard, I had a volunteer come up
[41:58.490 --> 42:02.610]  next to a juicy, it was actually a male plant
[42:02.610 --> 42:06.130]  came up next to a juicy fruit female, pollinated it.
[42:06.130 --> 42:08.090]  I let it go, I thought it was a beautiful looking
[42:08.090 --> 42:11.690]  male plant volunteer, and we ran with it.
[42:11.690 --> 42:14.850]  So I made seeds and I used them for my giveaway
[42:14.850 --> 42:17.650]  and I think there's some fun in the,
[42:17.650 --> 42:19.210]  I've seen pictures of some of the plants.
[42:19.210 --> 42:23.090]  I think they all have a lot of turps.
[42:23.090 --> 42:25.490]  So good luck with those and I look forward
[42:25.490 --> 42:27.770]  to seeing pictures from everybody else.
[42:27.770 --> 42:30.090]  So actually, when you look at it,
[42:30.090 --> 42:34.770]  do you have suspicions of what that male plant was?
[42:34.770 --> 42:37.170]  Oh man, I had so many different varieties
[42:37.170 --> 42:38.650]  from the previous year.
[42:39.650 --> 42:42.930]  It's really hard to say and I haven't run them personally.
[42:42.930 --> 42:44.730]  Oh, got it, got it, okay, I was gonna say.
[42:44.730 --> 42:46.610]  I've had friends run it.
[42:46.610 --> 42:48.570]  So someone who's running it now,
[42:48.570 --> 42:50.410]  because a lot of you got them,
[42:50.410 --> 42:52.850]  you gotta let James smell it and smoke it
[42:53.610 --> 42:54.650]  and take pictures of it.
[42:55.650 --> 42:58.570]  It's kind of like who's the daddy, right?
[42:58.570 --> 42:59.410]  Who's your daddy?
[42:59.410 --> 43:00.970]  So there's a funny story about who's your daddy
[43:00.970 --> 43:02.490]  that I'd love to share with you guys.
[43:02.490 --> 43:07.490]  That was DNA Genetics' first strain was who's your daddy?
[43:07.770 --> 43:10.850]  And what they did was put a whole bunch of,
[43:10.850 --> 43:13.350]  they did a big cannabis plant orgy
[43:13.350 --> 43:15.250]  and put a whole bunch of males in the room
[43:15.250 --> 43:16.890]  with a whole bunch of females
[43:16.890 --> 43:18.890]  and basically open pollinated everything
[43:18.890 --> 43:20.330]  and sold the seeds.
[43:20.330 --> 43:22.050]  You know, genius back in the day,
[43:22.050 --> 43:26.170]  this was probably what, 2004 or maybe even before that.
[43:26.170 --> 43:28.050]  But big ups to the DNA guys,
[43:28.050 --> 43:31.290]  you know, that was their start in Amsterdam
[43:31.290 --> 43:33.490]  and those guys have been crushing ever since.
[43:36.050 --> 43:39.530]  So let's see.
[43:39.530 --> 43:40.970]  So the question, loud cannon jakes,
[43:40.970 --> 43:43.410]  you wanna get a pack of Dark Sunset.
[43:43.410 --> 43:47.690]  Dark Sunset is a cross of what two varieties?
[43:48.650 --> 43:49.910]  That is the question.
[43:50.910 --> 43:53.410]  I know the answer.
[43:55.070 --> 43:57.390]  I bet you do after packaging all those seeds.
[44:04.140 --> 44:04.980]  Are you reading that?
[44:04.980 --> 44:08.600]  Happy Valley, yeah, I think Happy Valley was the first one.
[44:10.220 --> 44:11.520]  Let me scroll up.
[44:15.660 --> 44:16.500]  Yeah.
[44:31.810 --> 44:32.890]  Right?
[44:32.890 --> 44:33.730]  Yeah.
[44:38.580 --> 44:43.200]  Someone read their product description text.
[44:45.260 --> 44:47.700]  Okay, someone asked, how do I get in on this giveaway?
[44:47.700 --> 44:50.100]  So I'm gonna be doing some trivia with Peter.
[44:50.100 --> 44:51.380]  We're gonna be giving away some stuff.
[44:51.380 --> 44:52.980]  I got some t-shirts up next
[44:54.020 --> 44:55.140]  that we're gonna be giving away.
[44:55.140 --> 44:57.140]  Some of my collection of t-shirts
[44:57.140 --> 44:58.580]  that I've gotten from people and friends
[44:58.580 --> 45:00.020]  that I've never worn before.
[45:00.020 --> 45:01.500]  Some really cool stuff.
[45:01.500 --> 45:03.100]  So all you have to do is answer the question
[45:03.100 --> 45:04.300]  and then if you're the winner,
[45:04.300 --> 45:07.940]  email me at jamesloudgenetics at gmail.com
[45:07.940 --> 45:09.940]  and we will get some stuff out to you.
[45:11.740 --> 45:13.700]  So the next thing up,
[45:13.740 --> 45:16.980]  we've got this Midnight Rider,
[45:18.140 --> 45:20.020]  one of my good friends.
[45:20.020 --> 45:21.660]  Hippie Hill Genetics.
[45:21.660 --> 45:23.940]  Midnight Rider seeds no longer exist.
[45:23.940 --> 45:28.220]  This is 100% hemp shirt from Recreator.
[45:28.220 --> 45:30.460]  Retail is $50 on this shirt.
[45:30.460 --> 45:33.500]  It's nice and soft, never been worn before.
[45:33.500 --> 45:34.340]  What a beauty.
[45:35.260 --> 45:37.780]  It'd be funny if I was giving you guys my used clothes.
[45:37.780 --> 45:38.620]  But.
[45:39.620 --> 45:42.620]  It'd be more interesting to see who tries to win it.
[45:44.660 --> 45:47.700]  What year did Loud Seeds win their first Cannabis Cup
[45:47.700 --> 45:48.660]  is the question.
[45:50.460 --> 45:52.260]  Okay, you monitor the responses
[45:52.260 --> 45:54.260]  while I sprint to the bathroom.
[45:54.260 --> 45:55.100]  Okay, perfect.
[45:56.580 --> 46:07.040]  Randy, Randy Haas.
[46:08.520 --> 46:10.040]  He said 2012.
[46:11.280 --> 46:13.560]  And that is the correct answer.
[46:14.120 --> 46:16.520]  And that is the correct answer.
[46:19.080 --> 46:20.640]  Can Brazil, you can play from anywhere.
[46:20.640 --> 46:22.760]  I'll send this stuff anywhere in the world.
[46:25.800 --> 46:27.040]  All these hemp seeds.
[46:28.680 --> 46:32.440]  And Randy Haas, congratulations Randy.
[46:40.520 --> 46:44.000]  And that would be the Midnight Rider shirt.
[46:49.610 --> 46:51.650]  Okay, and these things are going in the mail on Monday.
[46:51.810 --> 46:53.810]  You guys will get them relatively soon.
[46:54.850 --> 46:56.330]  The next one is pretty special.
[46:56.330 --> 47:01.330]  We got a, this shirt is a pretty special we got here.
[47:01.690 --> 47:06.690]  So this animal cookies T-shirt.
[47:06.890 --> 47:07.730]  Okay, so who.
[47:07.730 --> 47:09.050]  This is from Cookies.
[47:09.050 --> 47:10.370]  Who won the last one?
[47:10.370 --> 47:11.730]  Randy Haas.
[47:13.650 --> 47:15.330]  So this shirt right here.
[47:16.450 --> 47:19.130]  This is, these were given out at the Cup in 2013
[47:19.130 --> 47:20.890]  in San Francisco.
[47:20.930 --> 47:24.130]  Either 2012 or 2000, maybe 2012 actually.
[47:24.130 --> 47:26.170]  But Sirius who passed away,
[47:27.650 --> 47:29.530]  who was the creator of animal cookies
[47:29.530 --> 47:30.970]  and some other varieties.
[47:32.010 --> 47:32.850]  You guys may have known.
[47:32.850 --> 47:36.530]  He was a legendary cannabis guy in the Bay Area.
[47:36.530 --> 47:37.930]  This is from one of his.
[47:37.930 --> 47:40.090]  And I never, you know, I love this shirt.
[47:40.090 --> 47:42.890]  Just not my color, but I've saved it ever since.
[47:42.890 --> 47:46.770]  It's one of the original cookies shirts from Cookies brand.
[47:47.610 --> 47:54.760]  So let's see.
[47:56.080 --> 47:58.320]  When was the, oh, we can't do that one.
[47:58.320 --> 48:01.400]  Let's, so it is a Loud Seeds question as well.
[48:01.400 --> 48:04.040]  What was the first cross that Loud Seeds won with?
[48:04.040 --> 48:05.760]  And who was, it's the same.
[48:05.760 --> 48:06.920]  Who was the first person ever won
[48:06.920 --> 48:08.600]  with the Girl Scout Cookies cross?
[48:10.280 --> 48:11.640]  And what year was it won?
[48:23.380 --> 48:25.380]  Ian said you can keep the cookie shirt.
[48:27.580 --> 48:29.380]  The original loud is the wrong answer.
[48:29.380 --> 48:31.380]  Conjure Farmer OG is the wrong answer.
[48:31.380 --> 48:32.220]  Let's see.
[48:36.350 --> 48:38.390]  Okay, we got part of the right answer, Loud Scout.
[48:38.390 --> 48:39.430]  But what year was it?
[48:44.020 --> 48:46.340]  Someone said 2013 and that's wrong.
[48:52.770 --> 48:54.290]  We've got people with partial answers.
[48:54.290 --> 48:55.890]  They're partially correct.
[48:55.890 --> 48:58.650]  So we need the year and we need the name of the strain.
[48:59.850 --> 49:02.090]  In one comment, there you go.
[49:02.090 --> 49:04.370]  There's one, but he's off by a.
[49:05.850 --> 49:07.890]  So Loud Scout in 2000.
[49:07.890 --> 49:09.450]  What, there's, nope.
[49:10.490 --> 49:11.810]  Guys, you're getting close.
[49:11.810 --> 49:13.370]  You can't just say the year.
[49:13.370 --> 49:16.130]  You have to say what it was and the year.
[49:16.130 --> 49:18.930]  Loud Scout 2012, Adam Bolton.
[49:18.930 --> 49:20.490]  Yes.
[49:20.490 --> 49:23.290]  Yeah, Loud Seeds first winners with the Loud Scout,
[49:23.290 --> 49:26.090]  which was, we won before Cookies ever won.
[49:26.090 --> 49:28.810]  And Cookies was just getting popular.
[49:28.810 --> 49:33.010]  That was 2012 when Loud Seeds won with Loud Scout,
[49:33.010 --> 49:36.250]  which Platinum, the Platinum OG
[49:36.250 --> 49:39.850]  times the Girl Scout Cookies, the Forum Cut.
[49:40.810 --> 49:43.010]  I don't know, it's weird when we talk about Cookies
[49:43.010 --> 49:47.770]  and Forum and Thin Men and these original cuts back then.
[49:47.770 --> 49:48.610]  We had gotten the cut.
[49:48.610 --> 49:50.610]  We paid $5,000 for the cut from a guy
[49:50.610 --> 49:53.450]  that worked in a grow shop in Berkeley
[49:53.450 --> 49:55.970]  and it didn't yield very well.
[49:55.970 --> 49:57.250]  It was a very finicky plant.
[49:57.250 --> 49:59.730]  It grew very similar to OG Kush back in the day.
[49:59.730 --> 50:03.170]  So it had a very, like the node spacing was terrible.
[50:03.170 --> 50:05.530]  You'd have four finger node spacing between the buds
[50:05.530 --> 50:07.570]  and you'd have these little buds.
[50:07.570 --> 50:09.730]  If you got three quarters of a pound per thousand
[50:10.610 --> 50:11.810]  when we were originally running it,
[50:11.810 --> 50:13.890]  per thousand watt, you were doing good.
[50:15.130 --> 50:16.650]  A lot of people get higher yields
[50:16.650 --> 50:19.090]  with some of the other cookie varieties,
[50:19.090 --> 50:21.490]  but we needed a way to improve it to get better yields
[50:21.490 --> 50:23.170]  because everybody just wanted it back then.
[50:23.170 --> 50:26.090]  So it was crossed with the Platinum OG.
[50:27.530 --> 50:29.890]  The Platinum OG I got from a guy named,
[50:30.970 --> 50:35.010]  Ziki Farms, a guy named G from Ziki
[50:35.010 --> 50:36.370]  got me some stuff back then
[50:36.370 --> 50:38.050]  and I was messing around with breeding
[50:38.050 --> 50:40.530]  and he got me the Platinum cut like two years before.
[50:40.530 --> 50:43.450]  And I thought, man, this Platinum OG is a monster yielder
[50:43.450 --> 50:44.930]  going with the cookies, it'd be great.
[50:44.930 --> 50:47.970]  And sure enough, that was a great cut.
[50:47.970 --> 50:50.370]  And that was originally the Platinum Cookies.
[50:51.210 --> 50:52.810]  Those the original, you know,
[50:52.810 --> 50:54.530]  things have gotten mixed up with the names
[50:54.530 --> 50:57.450]  where the original Platinum Cookies originated from,
[50:57.450 --> 50:59.250]  but we gave out the Platinum Cookies
[50:59.250 --> 51:01.290]  as the one we didn't wanna keep.
[51:01.290 --> 51:02.770]  So that was the one that went out to the people.
[51:02.770 --> 51:04.810]  We kept the Loud Scout for ourselves.
[51:05.650 --> 51:08.650]  And the rest is history.
[51:11.090 --> 51:12.250]  OG Kush the movie.
[51:12.250 --> 51:14.450]  Someday there'll be an OG Kush movie, I guarantee it.
[51:14.450 --> 51:18.010]  A lot of, is there a different Platinum Cookies?
[51:18.010 --> 51:19.730]  So yeah, there is a different Platinum Cookies.
[51:19.730 --> 51:22.490]  Berners Platinum Cookies is only GSC.
[51:22.490 --> 51:25.850]  So my Platinum Cookies that I gave out was,
[51:25.850 --> 51:26.810]  it had hermaphrodite.
[51:26.810 --> 51:28.370]  So basically it had intersexual traits.
[51:28.370 --> 51:30.690]  It had tendency to hermaphrodite,
[51:31.130 --> 51:34.570]  or it had, you'd have the,
[51:34.570 --> 51:36.850]  basically you get bananas for sure.
[51:36.850 --> 51:38.010]  And sometimes you get seeds.
[51:38.010 --> 51:40.250]  So it had a tendency for hermaphrodism.
[51:41.090 --> 51:42.730]  We gave that out because all my friends
[51:42.730 --> 51:44.010]  were bugging me to get a cut.
[51:44.010 --> 51:46.290]  So we gave that out as Platinum Cookies.
[51:46.290 --> 51:51.290]  Then, and that was like 2011-ish, maybe, beginning of 2012.
[51:52.530 --> 51:55.450]  And then there was other stuff in the market
[51:55.450 --> 51:58.330]  that was just a Girl Scout cookie phenotype
[51:58.330 --> 52:00.250]  that was Platinum Cookies.
[52:00.770 --> 52:05.370]  And so there was a bunch of mix-ups on who was what,
[52:05.370 --> 52:10.370]  who had what Platinum 96 cookies.
[52:10.410 --> 52:13.130]  I don't know what that is, but that sounds interesting.
[52:14.130 --> 52:19.130]  So anyway, moving on, we've got the.
[52:21.250 --> 52:24.250]  So just remember, the fun part is.
[52:24.250 --> 52:27.610]  Did you read the winner of the animal cookies T-shirt?
[52:28.290 --> 52:30.850]  I did.
[52:30.850 --> 52:31.690]  Uh-oh.
[52:32.570 --> 52:36.610]  I also threw up your email address
[52:36.610 --> 52:38.450]  so he can get in touch with you.
[52:38.450 --> 52:39.290]  Okay, perfect.
[52:41.170 --> 52:44.010]  It was, good God.
[52:44.010 --> 52:46.170]  Was it Adam Bolton?
[52:46.170 --> 52:47.010]  Yes.
[52:54.190 --> 52:57.070]  Re-engineered version by Jigga that was lost in Santa Rosa.
[52:57.070 --> 52:58.750]  I don't know anything about that.
[52:59.430 --> 53:07.620]  Forum Cookies is a copycat.
[53:07.620 --> 53:11.180]  Well, no, the original Forum Cookies is the original.
[53:11.180 --> 53:13.140]  That was the original cookies was the Forum.
[53:13.140 --> 53:16.220]  That was the one that everyone talked about on the Forum.
[53:16.220 --> 53:17.380]  Platinum Wave is gone now.
[53:17.380 --> 53:20.020]  Yes, Platinum Wave is gone now.
[53:20.020 --> 53:20.860]  Nothing wrong with that.
[53:20.860 --> 53:22.980]  Cookies, if you're in San Francisco,
[53:22.980 --> 53:24.020]  people still love cookies.
[53:24.020 --> 53:25.180]  It's just not what it used to be.
[53:25.180 --> 53:26.300]  Same thing, Sunset Sherbert.
[53:26.300 --> 53:29.020]  I mean, real good Sunset Sherbert, real good cookies.
[53:29.020 --> 53:30.660]  Still amazing.
[53:30.660 --> 53:31.980]  It's hard to describe.
[53:32.140 --> 53:33.740]  Still amazing.
[53:33.740 --> 53:35.100]  It's hard to disagree.
[53:38.660 --> 53:40.380]  It definitely wasn't a granddaddy perv.
[53:40.380 --> 53:42.580]  I don't wanna talk about who bred it or what bred it
[53:42.580 --> 53:43.860]  or get into those arguments.
[53:43.860 --> 53:44.900]  That's none of my business.
[53:44.900 --> 53:46.660]  I kind of try to stay out of the stuff.
[53:46.660 --> 53:49.260]  You can make your own mind up on who bred all this stuff.
[53:49.260 --> 53:51.820]  There's plenty of stuff out there.
[53:51.820 --> 53:53.620]  There's people trolling other people.
[53:53.620 --> 53:55.900]  I try to stay out of the drama.
[53:55.900 --> 53:58.220]  There is definitely Durban Cookies in the,
[53:58.220 --> 54:00.940]  there's definitely Durban in the cookies ancestry.
[54:00.940 --> 54:03.140]  Definitely 100%.
[54:03.140 --> 54:06.940]  If you talk about the anise that you get from Durban,
[54:06.940 --> 54:08.780]  we used to grow Durban poison.
[54:08.780 --> 54:11.340]  We have these monster, huge Durban plants
[54:11.340 --> 54:13.220]  and they're real orange and hairy.
[54:13.220 --> 54:17.420]  They weren't on the leaning side of the haze
[54:17.420 --> 54:19.100]  because it was crossed with super silver haze.
[54:19.100 --> 54:20.740]  So like in Colorado and Washington,
[54:20.740 --> 54:23.780]  what I'm seeing as Durban poison is really hazy.
[54:23.780 --> 54:25.940]  The stuff that we had in the Bay Area,
[54:25.940 --> 54:29.300]  my friend Josh Freeman from Silverback Gorilla,
[54:29.300 --> 54:31.260]  he created a strain called Silverback Gorilla.
[54:31.260 --> 54:35.780]  He brought a pack of Sensi seeds down from BC,
[54:35.780 --> 54:37.100]  the Durban poison ones.
[54:37.100 --> 54:39.940]  And he selected one of the seeds.
[54:39.940 --> 54:42.700]  The keeper one for him was the one that wasn't hazy.
[54:42.700 --> 54:47.340]  It was very anise and musky, like strong musk on the nose.
[54:47.340 --> 54:50.420]  And that strong, the first time I smoked cookies,
[54:50.420 --> 54:52.740]  I said, oh man, it's got Durban in it.
[54:52.740 --> 54:56.140]  There's it's unmistakable, unmistakable Durban,
[54:57.340 --> 54:58.740]  Durban, not Durban poison,
[54:58.820 --> 55:01.340]  but really Durban from that region.
[55:01.340 --> 55:05.580]  So cookies definitely 100% has Durban in it.
[55:05.580 --> 55:08.540]  We can talk about F1 Durban, Fino, all that stuff.
[55:08.540 --> 55:10.980]  But I guarantee you one thing that's a fact
[55:10.980 --> 55:13.660]  is that there's Durban in Girl Scout cookies.
[55:15.940 --> 55:19.260]  Kind of off topic, but one day I wanna talk anise
[55:21.660 --> 55:26.260]  as a base ingredient in cooking.
[55:28.780 --> 55:31.300]  Anise as a base ingredient.
[55:32.900 --> 55:34.020]  And anise is great.
[55:34.940 --> 55:35.780]  I think anise is-
[55:35.780 --> 55:39.220]  Like there's a lot of Chinese food that it's in,
[55:39.220 --> 55:41.300]  not like American Chinese, but.
[55:41.300 --> 55:43.220]  Sure, traditional Chinese.
[55:43.220 --> 55:45.820]  I think, me being Finnish and Swedish,
[55:45.820 --> 55:48.940]  candy, we have anise candy and that's very popular.
[55:48.940 --> 55:50.180]  And I absolutely love it.
[55:50.180 --> 55:51.900]  It reminds me of childhood.
[55:51.900 --> 55:54.700]  And some of the stuff is so pungent,
[55:54.740 --> 55:57.460]  it almost burns your nose.
[55:57.460 --> 55:59.100]  It's so strong with the anise.
[56:01.340 --> 56:02.500]  It's not elderberry,
[56:02.500 --> 56:06.660]  but there's like a Scandinavian berry that gets-
[56:06.660 --> 56:07.740]  Lingenberry.
[56:07.740 --> 56:08.580]  Lingenberry, right.
[56:08.580 --> 56:11.340]  Lingenberries, we put them on all kinds of stuff,
[56:11.340 --> 56:15.140]  but it's a different berry and we use it as a preserve.
[56:15.140 --> 56:18.020]  We make lingenberry preserve and Swedish pancakes.
[56:18.020 --> 56:19.380]  If you've ever had Swedish pancakes,
[56:19.380 --> 56:20.220]  they're absolutely amazing.
[56:20.220 --> 56:22.580]  You get lingenberries with those and some cream.
[56:23.580 --> 56:24.940]  Any insight on feminizing,
[56:24.940 --> 56:28.140]  like methodology such as colloidal silver versus-
[56:28.140 --> 56:31.620]  Yeah, so colloidal silver, I would say CS,
[56:31.620 --> 56:35.500]  we're talking about insight on feminizing,
[56:35.500 --> 56:39.100]  nano silver, STS, colloidal silver,
[56:39.100 --> 56:40.300]  those all work really good.
[56:40.300 --> 56:42.180]  I wouldn't say that light stressing
[56:42.180 --> 56:44.660]  is a good way to reverse your plants.
[56:44.660 --> 56:46.660]  Stressing isn't necessarily-
[56:46.660 --> 56:48.020]  Yes, I'm Scandinavian.
[56:48.020 --> 56:49.380]  We got someone in the chat.
[56:50.220 --> 56:54.060]  Yep, my ancestors are from Finland and Sweden
[56:54.060 --> 56:55.980]  and I'm from Portland originally
[56:56.980 --> 56:58.300]  and raised in the Bay Area.
[56:59.260 --> 57:04.260]  Black licorice, Danish wife, good stuff.
[57:08.490 --> 57:10.170]  Nordic, yep.
[57:10.170 --> 57:11.210]  I look Nordic, right?
[57:11.210 --> 57:13.090]  I would agree with that.
[57:14.650 --> 57:16.010]  Not Mediterranean.
[57:18.530 --> 57:20.010]  Yeah, and I think someone asked
[57:20.010 --> 57:22.130]  what were some of the strains that didn't work together?
[57:22.130 --> 57:23.930]  I've done some stuff that,
[57:25.650 --> 57:27.330]  where I popped one of,
[57:27.330 --> 57:29.290]  it got one of the outliers in five seeds
[57:29.290 --> 57:32.090]  and then I popped more and I could never find it again,
[57:33.050 --> 57:37.650]  so I did the bubblegum times J1
[57:37.650 --> 57:40.970]  because I feel like J1 already had a bubblegum terp in it
[57:40.970 --> 57:43.570]  and for whatever reason, I only made seeds,
[57:43.570 --> 57:45.330]  I pollinated a small branch with it
[57:46.330 --> 57:49.050]  and the problem with that was,
[57:49.050 --> 57:51.450]  is that I couldn't find what I was looking for.
[57:51.450 --> 57:52.610]  Again, once we had the original,
[57:52.610 --> 57:56.890]  then we lost the original with one of the selections,
[57:56.890 --> 57:58.250]  then I went back to the seeds thinking,
[57:58.250 --> 58:00.330]  oh man, I didn't make enough seeds.
[58:00.330 --> 58:01.530]  So we popped all the rest of the seeds
[58:01.530 --> 58:04.130]  and couldn't find the one that was nearly as good
[58:04.130 --> 58:05.450]  as the other ones.
[58:05.450 --> 58:08.690]  So sometimes finding those outliers is tricky.
[58:08.690 --> 58:11.410]  So make sure, if you find one and you keep it,
[58:11.410 --> 58:15.330]  it's so hard without having a real nursery to work with.
[58:18.140 --> 58:19.500]  Oh, we have a...
[58:20.540 --> 58:21.380]  So yep.
[58:24.420 --> 58:26.060]  No, I'm not saying that light stressing
[58:26.060 --> 58:27.460]  produces feminized seeds.
[58:27.460 --> 58:29.980]  I'm saying that if plants are susceptible
[58:29.980 --> 58:32.700]  to things like light stressing or stressing,
[58:32.700 --> 58:34.700]  I don't think that's a great way to make feminized seeds.
[58:34.700 --> 58:38.180]  Stressing is not necessarily a great way
[58:38.180 --> 58:39.460]  to produce feminized seeds.
[58:39.460 --> 58:42.540]  Using something that blocks ethylene, on the other hand, is.
[58:43.540 --> 58:48.220]  So breeding GG4.
[58:48.220 --> 58:51.140]  GG4, so you wanna know a breeding GG4?
[58:51.140 --> 58:55.020]  I'd love to get Tim and Kyle from Canagenics,
[58:55.020 --> 58:57.260]  from Can Organics and Canagenics,
[58:57.260 --> 58:59.420]  my partner's up here to talk about it.
[58:59.420 --> 59:04.420]  But GG4, I feel like a lot of the genotypes and phenotypes
[59:04.700 --> 59:08.020]  are very, very much like the Gorilla Glue,
[59:08.020 --> 59:09.540]  especially the way the structure
[59:09.540 --> 59:11.100]  and the smell comes across.
[59:11.140 --> 59:14.580]  There's a lot of dominance in the Gorilla
[59:14.580 --> 59:19.580]  when you put that on something like the Gelato 41.
[59:19.780 --> 59:22.220]  So it's a great cross.
[59:22.220 --> 59:26.060]  I feel like that one, I have some of the flower here,
[59:26.060 --> 59:28.180]  and it definitely has a lot of the chocolate.
[59:28.180 --> 59:30.020]  It does have a little bit of floral.
[59:30.020 --> 59:35.020]  I feel like some of the selections are an improved version,
[59:35.500 --> 59:38.860]  but the Gorilla Glue is a classic.
[59:38.860 --> 59:39.980]  It's one thing that was popular.
[59:39.980 --> 59:43.420]  I think it's not as hype as it was anymore, but that's okay.
[59:43.420 --> 59:44.980]  I think we're going through some changes
[59:44.980 --> 59:47.300]  and it's gonna be bred into a lot of different things,
[59:47.300 --> 59:48.980]  but it definitely has dominance.
[59:52.240 --> 59:56.360]  Ran a GG4 test batch last season and they were terrible.
[59:56.360 --> 59:59.920]  Well, test batch of straight GG4, it's just opinion.
[59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.440]  I think some people love it.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.280]  It's so subjective because what one person
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.720]  thinks is fantastic, like Blue Dream,
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.640]  a hundred other people think could be terrible,
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:13.640]  yet Blue Dream back in the day was a high-priced ticket item.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.880]  It was $4,000 a pound to dispensaries,
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.320]  Harborside, everybody else, they're paying $4,000 a pound
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.320]  for Blue Dream, if you can believe that.
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.240]  So, and now people hate on Blue Dream,
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.200]  except for Justin Bieber.
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.120]  Justin Bieber's favorite strain is Blue Dream,
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.080]  and that's why it became popular again.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.120]  And nothing wrong with, it's just like food.
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.400]  Food and wine and all these things, cigars, cannabis,
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.000]  it's all so subjective.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.880]  So we shouldn't hate on other people for what they like.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.960]  We should kind of try to understand it as a breeder.
[01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.200]  You can breed for yourself or you can breed
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.040]  for other people.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.000]  There's two different routes you can go with that.
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:56.400]  So if you grew from seed and tested it, isn't GG4?
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:01.040]  Yeah, GG4 is, not that it's a clone only,
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.160]  but it was a, you're not gonna buy seeds of true GG4.
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.960]  Nobody's went and stabilized.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.200]  Did you see that one on the screen?
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.920]  What do you think is the backbone genetics
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.120]  behind OG Kush, Afghani, Lemontai?
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.720]  I think possibly, I think that's a great,
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.960]  we could do a whole show on OG Kush
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.280]  and what we think it is and where we think it came from.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.040]  I think there's a lot of good stories
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.120]  from the guys from Florida, Josh D,
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.240]  there's guys in Colorado.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.600]  I'd love to have them all on the show
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.960]  and we could talk about it.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.960]  And then Mr. Lincoln is reminding me
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.320]  of the question he emailed.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.560]  I for, that, Mr. Lincoln, your questions
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:43.680]  are all very lengthy.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.120]  So do you remember that multi-paragraph email
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.320]  I forwarded you?
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.760]  I do.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.640]  I think I got to some of those questions, actually.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.480]  We've definitely done some.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:54.800]  Well, no, but then there was a new,
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.040]  there were new questions since last week.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.560]  Okay, yeah, I charge $2,500 a day to answer questions.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.360]  Literally, literally, I do for consulting.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.840]  I'd love to answer some of your questions.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.280]  We'll get through some.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.240]  You got to understand that we're going to answer the ones
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.520]  when we can and there's a lot of questions
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.360]  from a lot of people.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.800]  So we'll get to questions when we can.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.320]  You know, we'll have some other people on the show
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.640]  that have great answers to great questions.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.240]  Has anyone seen pictures of people
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.520]  who drank lots of colloidal silver?
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.760]  They kind of look like sparks, yes.
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.800]  It'll turn you into a star.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.000]  Smurfs, yes.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:31.920]  It'll turn you into a smurf.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:32.920]  It'll make you blue.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:40.040]  What's your favorite crazy sativa or land race?
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.240]  I'm pretty partial to the Red Congolese lately.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.440]  There's a lot of good ones out there,
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.240]  but that Red Congo is great.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.000]  And then we talk about some land races
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.800]  like Orange Hill from Jamaica,
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.120]  Lamb's Bread, which you don't see very often.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.720]  I see in some crosses.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:57.080]  I love Lamb's Bread.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.720]  We got some more questions about Durban poison.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:06.200]  Sativa based on its geographic history.
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.640]  I think Durban poison, geographic,
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:16.640]  Durban is geographic history as far as geographic location.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.760]  But if we're talking about Durban poison,
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.520]  it's a cross with super silver haze.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.880]  And so super silver haze is pretty complex.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.720]  You see that question on the screen?
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.440]  Okay.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.200]  When will sour D and skunk smells come back?
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.240]  Not the sweet stuff.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:34.720]  I don't think that they ever went away.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.440]  So I think it's just which circles you're in.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.040]  Cause I have sour diesel right here.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.240]  I mean, I've been smoking on sour diesel every year.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.840]  I get a personal, I think I even showed it on the show.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:46.120]  I get some personal sour diesel
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.520]  and it lasts me probably till May.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:51.000]  And by May I'm like, oh, sour diesel is cool,
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.520]  but it's just okay.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.880]  And then I wait for November again
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.320]  and then the sour diesel is ready and I smoke on it.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.920]  I really like the effects of it.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.800]  Skunk, I don't know.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.800]  There's something going on because I have yet to see,
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.480]  we can talk about roadkill skunk all day
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.480]  and people who have it and people who don't have it
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.480]  and whatever, I have yet to see it.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.920]  So show me some, smoke some with me, share it.
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.480]  I think there's people that have seeds of it.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.040]  It doesn't express like it used to, if it is what it is.
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.520]  It's just like the cat piss.
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.440]  I still haven't seen cat piss in the last 20 years
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.880]  that's real cat piss.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.800]  So, I think a lot of stuff was lost, lost along the way.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.040]  There's definite genetic drift that could have occurred.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.200]  There's all kinds of things.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.160]  Amherst sour diesel, someone tried that.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.680]  Yes, Amherst sour diesel is great.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.680]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.760]  Same thing with Spirox sour diesel.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:51.160]  Christian from Finest was part of the selection process
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:56.160]  of that Spirox sour diesel, which is a faster flowering,
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:01.400]  denser buds, really good.
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.600]  But I still love the original East Coast sour diesel.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.440]  There was only one.
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.520]  We did the sour diesel show,
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.880]  Peter and I did the sour diesel show with Mojave Richmond
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.560]  and that was a good one.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.360]  And there was only one sour diesel.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.980]  It was a bad seed with sour silicate.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.320]  And yeah, the truth is there was an East Coast sour diesel.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.160]  There may be other truths that people think they know,
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.880]  but the guy who selected and found the sour silicate,
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.880]  he found the real sour diesel.
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:30.920]  That was an original.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:35.060]  There's a lot of mystery behind the history
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.840]  of a lot of our genetics.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.240]  And so having people that were the originals
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:43.320]  that can be traced back through people like Chemdog
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.480]  and other things like that,
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.280]  it's great having some true history.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:51.120]  Someone said, what happened to GDP, granddaddy purple?
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.020]  That one went away.
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:54.060]  It's still around, but I'll tell you the reason
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:57.040]  people don't wanna grow GDP, granddaddy purple,
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.300]  veggies, when I used to grow it,
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.560]  I used to veg it for 31 days.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.320]  And so with a lot of these new varieties with CO2,
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.760]  you're looking at two weeks of veg.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.420]  So you can cut your veg time in half.
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:10.600]  If you think of growing over a period of a year,
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:15.160]  if you can save two weeks on five cycles,
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.640]  10 weeks, that's a whole nother run.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:24.660]  Someone asked about gelato parent strains and then.
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:29.340]  So yeah, gelato was the,
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:34.580]  hmm, that was Sunset Sherbert times,
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.940]  we were looked that up, but yeah,
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:42.820]  that was Pink Panties made the Sunset Sherbert.
[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:44.820]  And then the gelato was,
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:49.020]  so you had Girl Scout Cookies to get to Sunset Sherbert.
[01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:52.500]  We had Girl Scout Cookies times the Pink Panties,
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.000]  which made Sunset Sherbert.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.740]  And then that put back on the Girl Scout Cookies
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:07:01.020]  on the Thin Mint, I believe that was what made the gelato,
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.340]  all those gelato numbers.
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:05.820]  And Mario, Mr. Sherbinsky could,
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:07.900]  I'll get him in here one of these days, hopefully,
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:09.580]  to kind of discuss his breeding
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:13.100]  and his perspective of the industry.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:17.420]  He's got a lot of great things to say, I'm sure.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:18.780]  And he's a really good guy.
[01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:23.300]  So Thin Mint Girl Scout Cookies times Sunset Sherbert.
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.420]  That is what the gelato,
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:27.060]  and there's a lot of gelatos that are really good.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.980]  I had no idea that gelato,
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:30.740]  I was so stoked on Sunset Sherbert
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.700]  when the gelatos came out, I was like, eh, it's okay.
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:36.020]  And gelato is now the new Girl Scout Cookies.
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:37.060]  It's even bigger.
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.820]  It's even bigger than Girl Scout Cookies was.
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:42.580]  I think it's bigger for a couple of reasons.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:46.340]  One of them is that cannabis is reaching a lot more people
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:50.060]  with legalization and decriminalization and medical.
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.860]  So genetics are getting more spread out,
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.700]  but even in Europe, it's all over Europe now.
[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.660]  Girl Scout Cookies took forever to get over there.
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:59.420]  And in a small, short time
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:02.300]  with this exponential growth of our industry,
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:05.260]  stuff has really spread out there and become popular.
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.900]  And also advertising.
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:09.860]  People have been advertising stuff so much,
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:12.220]  been able to brand stuff.
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.620]  I think the Cookies guys really did a good job
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:18.980]  at taking the way in the States for advertising and clothing.
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:21.260]  You look at Cookies clothing, there's nothing like it.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:23.460]  Those guys just crush on the clothing.
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:26.900]  I went to their fulfillment center,
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.180]  where the warehouse where they do the fulfillment,
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:30.180]  and it's next level.
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.740]  They have hundreds and hundreds of products.
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:34.260]  They have several employees.
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.180]  I think they got probably 50 or 60 employees
[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.060]  doing the fulfillment for their clothing.
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.180]  So that's something to be said
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.660]  about how the brands have got out there
[01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:45.220]  and things have gotten real popular.
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.540]  A lot of gelato smokeless.
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.540]  I don't understand the hype, but.
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.380]  Yeah, and it's nothing.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.660]  Regardless of understanding it,
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:00.860]  it's pretty amazing what companies have done
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:02.260]  with their following on Instagram
[01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:04.900]  and how big of Instagram has been a pedestal
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:06.700]  for some of these guys
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:10.340]  that were breeding in their closets with four lights.
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:12.420]  Instagram can make you look like a big time celebrity
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.660]  and stuff, it's great.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:17.500]  So let's get to another one of these shirts.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:18.620]  I got one.
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.140]  You guys remember Master Yoda.
[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:26.860]  This is Master Yoda's Kush shirt.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:29.340]  So we got this right here.
[01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:35.090]  And.
[01:09:36.330 --> 01:09:38.890]  And what reading related trivia question
[01:09:38.890 --> 01:09:40.650]  do you wanna throw at everyone?
[01:09:40.650 --> 01:09:45.330]  So Master Yoda's strain, the Master Yoda Kush
[01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:47.850]  is a cross of what two varieties?
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:59.060]  We need the Jeopardy music going right now.
[01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:03.010]  And it is a good one.
[01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:05.330]  He gave me some of it and it's fantastic.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.300]  Alien times.
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:11.820]  Yeah, Skywalker.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:14.860]  Okay, Smalls, I think Smalls was first.
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:15.700]  All right, where is it?
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.020]  OG and Master.
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:19.100]  OG and Master, we got a lot of OG.
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.260]  So is that right?
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.100]  It is.
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.820]  All right, Smalls.
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:32.740]  Send James an email right there, boom.
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:40.100]  And you got the Master Yoda shirt.
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:43.500]  Okay.
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:46.140]  So we got a sweatshirt next.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.080]  We got this from my favorite shop,
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.280]  DNS Garden Supply, Urban Farm.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.120]  Really cool stuff.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:58.960]  He's got a hoodie.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.240]  It's a full on not sweatshirt, but a hoodie with a zipper.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.400]  These guys are great people.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.880]  You guys need supplies in the Bay Area
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.240]  or sent to you from anywhere, DNS Garden Supply.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.880]  They've been around forever, great company.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.840]  Matt and Jerm, the guys over there,
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.160]  just are just really good people when they crush it.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.640]  So tell them I sent you, you want the loud discount.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.880]  They'll hook you up.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.080]  Is it soft?
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.280]  Like a baby's bottom.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.720]  So the question is,
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.920]  and this is gonna be a grow question.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.960]  Think that we got to grow shop.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.160]  So this is just a, what does NPK stand for?
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:42.900]  Somebody, I know you guys know this one.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:43.780]  Fast.
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:44.620]  This should come fast.
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:45.980]  This should be an easy one.
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:03.020]  So we've got two answers that are wrong in the beginning.
[01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:09.170]  So I'm looking at,
[01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:14.370]  so you guys got, if you ever work,
[01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:16.970]  there's two Ps, potassium and phosphorus.
[01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:19.970]  You got to remember that potassium is K.
[01:12:21.650 --> 01:12:23.210]  So that's on the end for NPK.
[01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:26.090]  I saw nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus.
[01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.930]  That's not correct.
[01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:29.850]  It's nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium.
[01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:34.010]  So Jason was the,
[01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:37.090]  yeah.
[01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:39.810]  Yep.
[01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:40.650]  Jason E.
[01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:41.890]  First person.
[01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:43.970]  All right, Jason E.
[01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:48.210]  You can proudly rock the supply store hoodie
[01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:52.050]  as you're walking confidently
[01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:53.610]  through the streets of Oakland.
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:59.940]  Might get shot, not for wearing the shirt,
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:02.780]  but you might get shot just in general.
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:05.420]  Now, Oakland's not that bad.
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:07.180]  I think, you know, there's areas of Oakland
[01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.500]  that are bad just like any big city,
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.100]  but Oakland's a beautiful place for the most part.
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:13.980]  It's really getting gentrified.
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.740]  Buddha voice says, teach us.
[01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.910]  Okay.
[01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:23.430]  You guys see that one?
[01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:25.190]  Girl Scout cookies.
[01:13:25.190 --> 01:13:26.230]  Long sleeve.
[01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:29.750]  This shirt is a XL.
[01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:33.750]  I don't know why I never wore this shirt.
[01:13:35.190 --> 01:13:36.990]  It's not my style, really.
[01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:38.950]  I got a Silica shirt on today.
[01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:39.790]  This is an old school.
[01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.470]  You can't even get this anymore.
[01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:43.070]  My friend Donnie from Silica,
[01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:47.150]  he printed some of the coolest T-shirts back in the day.
[01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:50.550]  I've been going through.
[01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:55.550]  You need to send me a high res Ganja Farmer graphic
[01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:58.430]  so I can mock stuff up.
[01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:59.430]  Oh, for sure.
[01:13:59.430 --> 01:14:00.430]  We can definitely do that.
[01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:01.870]  I need to get you two logos.
[01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:07.020]  Okay, so.
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.020]  Any advice on the dark sunset?
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:12.180]  Any advice on the dark sunset?
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.740]  Any advice on the dark sunset?
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:18.020]  You know, I would say there's lots of advice
[01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.100]  on the dark sunset.
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:22.860]  Kyle and Tim, we can get them,
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:24.700]  especially Kyle getting him in on here
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.380]  to talk about how to grow it,
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:27.900]  but I feel like I would grow it.
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.620]  It's a 63 day variety.
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:32.540]  I would grow it like I would grow
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.980]  any other sherbet or gelato.
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:38.140]  It'll go right in there with sherbet or gelato
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.340]  because it's basically sherbet times gelato.
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:42.860]  So those, you know,
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.100]  they're not as finicky as Girl Scout cookies.
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:46.940]  I feel like they're a little more hearty.
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:47.780]  They grow a little better.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.460]  You'll get decent yields off it.
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.860]  And it just depends on what you're looking for.
[01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:55.860]  If you're looking for sweet turps or gas,
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:15:00.220]  you can go looking for expressions that are sweet
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.900]  or you can go for the ones that are sweet floral
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:05.580]  or if you want some that are gassy and fuely
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.900]  and there's all of that stuff in there.
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:10.980]  So regardless of what you're looking for,
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:12.980]  Jerry Bear cheers.
[01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:13.940]  Very nice.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:30.220]  Yeah, just cause I was talking about, hold on.
[01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:33.140]  Okay, cause I was just talking about this.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.840]  Okay, so we got this Girl Scout cookies t-shirt.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:41.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.520]  I love that logo.
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:45.320]  That logo says everything I wanted to say.
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.120]  So the question,
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.280]  question for the Girl Scout cookies t-shirt,
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.640]  who were the original members
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.360]  of the Girl Scout cookies crew?
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.400]  That was before it was even cookies
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.560]  when it was Girl Scout cookies.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:03.840]  Who were the four original guys?
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.440]  I mean, there was more, but the four original guys.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.240]  Girl Scout cookies t-shirt.
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.520]  I figured this has nothing to do with cookies either.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.320]  It's a company that was knocking off all the brands,
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.880]  the Keebler Elves, Berner and his boys.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:31.870]  I want, okay, Scott.
[01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:32.910]  There we go.
[01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:38.950]  I think Scott had it.
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:47.540]  Jigs, Pie Guy, Flux and Sherb will accept that.
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:49.940]  Berner was also part of that, but I liked that
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:53.060]  because he listed four there.
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:58.900]  So that was, that would be Jigga, Pie Guy, Flux
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.780]  and Sherbinsky and also Berner.
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:03.620]  So those guys together were the original.
[01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:06.100]  So Scott Stahlberg.
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:17.540]  Shoot, jams and email.
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.700]  Shoot me an email.
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.780]  Okay, let's get some more seeds, guys.
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:22.860]  Oh, it's 1220 already.
[01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:24.500]  Time just flies, Peter.
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:25.740]  We're gonna do this for 20 minutes
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.660]  and it turned into an hour and 20.
[01:17:31.450 --> 01:17:34.730]  Thought I'd be on the couch watching football right now.
[01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:36.650]  Yeah, okay, we're gonna wrap this up
[01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:38.130]  pretty quickly here, guys,
[01:17:38.130 --> 01:17:39.450]  so that Peter can watch football
[01:17:39.450 --> 01:17:41.370]  since football is so important to him.
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.980]  It's relaxing on a Sunday.
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.460]  Sports just isn't sports with all this stuff going on, man,
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:52.660]  with the COVID and...
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:58.340]  It must be trippy being a player like at an arena
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:01.580]  where you're used to 80,000 fans
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.820]  and then it's just complete silence.
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:09.700]  Okay, so let's give away some more seeds,
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:10.740]  some Loud Canagenics.
[01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:13.140]  We're gonna give away some of the Juice Box
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:15.460]  because I know everyone wants Juice Box.
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:19.260]  Greg is a Seahawks fan.
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:22.700]  Yeah, the Patriots are not very good this year,
[01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:25.700]  but that's okay.
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.340]  I can still rest on my laurels.
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:31.940]  Okay, so Juice Box, which is a Runtz,
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:34.700]  times Gelato 41.
[01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.780]  That's a white Runtz times Gelato 41.
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:41.620]  We need a good breeding question for that.
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.740]  Runtz, hmm.
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:50.660]  So what big seed company released Runtz crosses
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:53.740]  in the last couple months,
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.540]  or last few months, I should say,
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:59.900]  with Runtz that's in partnership with Runtz?
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:01.260]  Everybody's got these Runtz drops.
[01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.540]  We got Runtz, everybody's got a Runtz cross.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:07.220]  Who released a whole line of Runtz crosses with the Runtz?
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:11.140]  Oh, I see Exotic, Dereazbass.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:13.060]  Whoa.
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:13.900]  That was it.
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.780]  Exotic Genetics.
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:21.020]  And I would like to tell you guys they're really good.
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.620]  I'm impressed with the crosses.
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:25.780]  Sorry, I'm trying to get to the first guy.
[01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:26.860]  There we go.
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:28.460]  Yeah.
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:29.300]  Dereazbass.
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.780]  Bare ass bass, Dereazbass.
[01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:36.380]  I'm in an international country.
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.220]  Yeah.
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.060]  Okay.
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:43.740]  Rot Seeds.
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:44.580]  Who's Rot Seeds?
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:45.420]  R-O-T-C-E-D-S.
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:46.260]  I didn't even hear that.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:47.540]  Probably meant Riot.
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.320]  I'm done with Runtz at this point, LOL.
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.960]  I think a lot of people are trying to jump off
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:59.460]  the Runtz train, and I think there's some new stuff
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:00.300]  coming down.
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:01.140]  I don't know.
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:01.980]  I don't know.
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:02.820]  I don't know.
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:03.660]  I don't know.
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:04.500]  I don't know.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.340]  I don't know.
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:06.180]  I don't know.
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:07.940]  There's some new stuff coming down.
[01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:11.860]  Man, let me see if I can go show you some of this new stuff.
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:12.900]  Hold on one second, Peter.
[01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:14.300]  You wanna talk to these guys for a second?
[01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.700]  I'm gonna go grab some Panda Milk.
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:17.780]  Hold on one second.
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:18.620]  Go for it.
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:30.460]  I like James is also rocking the pajama pants right now.
[01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:35.060]  If you guys can see my holiday pajama pants.
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:39.580]  I'm very comfortable in the garage right now.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.840]  Yes, I think you did say, what?
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.240]  That's not what you said.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.000]  Did you say Panda Milk?
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:50.840]  You can't hear me.
[01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:55.630]  Did you say Panda Milk?
[01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:57.790]  Pajama pants, man.
[01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:58.990]  It's the holidays, dude.
[01:20:58.990 --> 01:21:00.830]  This is good, you know.
[01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:02.790]  I did say Panda Milk.
[01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:07.630]  You guys like my, they're actually Marvel pajama pants.
[01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:11.350]  Not just any player.
[01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:14.110]  I got magic pajama pants for Deadpool ones.
[01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:18.630]  So you guys can see this.
[01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:22.910]  This is some of the new, new called Panda Milk.
[01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:28.980]  Stuff is, this isn't even released yet,
[01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:31.980]  but it is purple and it is chunky.
[01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:36.860]  And it smells like really gassy and similar to Runtz,
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:38.460]  but I feel like it's more gassy.
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:41.660]  It'll be out next year in dispensaries all over California.
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:44.220]  I'm sure I get some of the pre-release stickers
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:45.260]  and other butt of it.
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:48.900]  My nice clean fingernails.
[01:21:51.970 --> 01:21:56.170]  Yeah, Terp Brigade is, it's coming from Terp Brigade
[01:21:56.170 --> 01:21:57.650]  from my friend Panda.
[01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:01.410]  Panda Milk, good stuff.
[01:22:03.370 --> 01:22:04.570]  You know, I think the Canagenics,
[01:22:04.570 --> 01:22:06.690]  there's a whole bunch of new Canagenics stuff coming out
[01:22:06.690 --> 01:22:09.090]  that I feel like, yeah, dense nugs.
[01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:10.690]  It's a Runtz times,
[01:22:11.530 --> 01:22:13.970]  Panda Milk is Runtz times cereal milk.
[01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:17.610]  And I think it was about a year and a half project
[01:22:18.450 --> 01:22:21.490]  that Panda took on to find the winner
[01:22:21.490 --> 01:22:24.490]  and cool packaging and labeling.
[01:22:26.690 --> 01:22:27.530]  Yeah.
[01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.610]  So yeah, I got a gummy company.
[01:22:30.610 --> 01:22:31.730]  I'm partnered with them.
[01:22:31.730 --> 01:22:33.690]  We're gonna do some gummies next year in California.
[01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:36.130]  So we'll have some licensed gummies on the market
[01:22:37.090 --> 01:22:39.730]  and we're producing and white labeling gummies
[01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:43.050]  for some of the big companies in the California metric.
[01:22:43.050 --> 01:22:44.650]  So that should be interesting.
[01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:51.050]  Who, in your breeder hall of fame?
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:55.860]  Can't hear you.
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:58.620]  Oh, James, name your top five breeders.
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:01.500]  Man, that's a really tough one.
[01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:04.020]  Or forget top five, just name some.
[01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:07.020]  Top five, I like so many different breeders.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:10.340]  And I think JJ, if we go back,
[01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:11.940]  you wanna talk about Neville?
[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:15.660]  Guys like Neville that did a lot of work.
[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:19.060]  I think.
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.860]  How about this, as you name people,
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:26.060]  talk about what, well, in succinct terms,
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:28.980]  about what made them unique and special.
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:33.020]  Oh, and there's just so many guys.
[01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:35.700]  And Neville, I mean, if you think of his work
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:37.980]  with the Hazes, with the A5,
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:40.500]  which is something special if you guys have never seen it.
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.140]  Skunk Man, Sam.
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:47.860]  I think we gotta give homage to the guys,
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:50.660]  the older guys, the guys that are the next generation
[01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:53.780]  past me that did a lot of the work.
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:55.700]  Simon from Sirius, if you wanna know
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:59.340]  who my favorite breeder of all time,
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:01.100]  one that I've got to meet and hang out with,
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:03.580]  it would be Simon from Sirius Seeds.
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:05.140]  He created the AK-47.
[01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:07.140]  He is a true F1 breeder.
[01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:10.140]  And what I mean by true F1 breeder,
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:13.580]  he had parental lines and he took those to create
[01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:17.260]  AK-47, Cali Mist, varieties like that.
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:19.540]  It took him five years to breed those varieties.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:21.100]  You think we could wait around for five years
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:22.500]  for varieties nowadays?
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.900]  It just, it wouldn't happen.
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:28.740]  Luke from Paradise is another interesting guy and breeder.
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:29.820]  I like him a lot.
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:32.140]  There's a bunch of Dutch guys
[01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:33.980]  that I have a lot of respect for.
[01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:35.740]  But then there's unnamed ones
[01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:37.020]  that you guys have never even heard of
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:40.100]  that I know from Humboldt and from Portland
[01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:42.100]  and Vancouver, Washington,
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.460]  friends and family that I think
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:46.180]  have done a good job with stuff.
[01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:49.420]  Shanti Baba, we got Shanti Baba.
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:50.260]  That's another good one.
[01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:52.340]  Duke, I would agree.
[01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:55.180]  Duke Diamond, he's big ups to Mr. Duke Diamond.
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:57.220]  Hopefully he'll be out of prison
[01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:58.620]  sometime in the near future.
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:05.020]  Neville was a Navy drunk.
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:06.660]  Yeah, I love when people troll on this stuff.
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:08.740]  Ace Seeds, they've done some great stuff.
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:14.180]  There's so many guys.
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:15.380]  What are your thoughts about Arjen?
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:16.660]  Arjen is a great guy, man.
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:20.420]  I think I go back, I got a lot of history with Arjen.
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:22.780]  I have nothing but good things to say about Arjen.
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:25.340]  I don't care what other people have to say.
[01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:27.340]  He is a great guy.
[01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:29.300]  He was there when he gave me great advice
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.860]  and has given me great advice
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:32.500]  when we won our first cup in Amsterdam
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:34.780]  when we didn't know we were gonna win and won.
[01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:39.540]  Arjen and Franco had a lot of influence,
[01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:44.340]  especially Franco on me early on in 2012
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:47.260]  when we were first starting to get popular.
[01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:48.700]  He was all about the sacred plant
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:50.180]  and that passion for the sacred plant.
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:53.540]  That was me and Franco sitting around together
[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.980]  and I said it and he says, I freaking love it.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:57.620]  And we were talking about that.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.620]  That's what it's all about.
[01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:00.460]  At the end of the day,
[01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:01.660]  it's the passion for the sacred plant.
[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:03.060]  I mean, we're dealing with something
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:06.580]  that's very powerful that can change the world.
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:09.500]  Rest in peace, Franco, the legend.
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:11.860]  And also this one.
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:16.060]  Bog, yeah, let's talk about Bog.
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:18.860]  So Bog, I think James from Seeds Here Now
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:20.140]  is doing a fundraiser.
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:22.180]  I'll be a part of it.
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:25.940]  Yeah, I think he wants to do it Wednesday, I believe.
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:29.420]  And Bog was another one of those special humans
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:32.740]  that was at the cups and always there with a smile
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:35.140]  and with good weed and he got it.
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:37.940]  He has another passion for the sacred plant guy.
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:40.820]  We've lost a lot of guys in the last couple of years.
[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:43.300]  It's really sad.
[01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:46.980]  But all things Josie Wales, GG4.
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:51.220]  These guys are all, and Subcool,
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.220]  regardless of what you thought of him personally,
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:56.420]  what he did early on in the industry,
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:57.860]  going against all this stuff.
[01:26:59.620 --> 01:27:01.940]  Subcool definitely held his place.
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:06.180]  And back then when people were all on the fruit turps,
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:08.260]  you gotta give respect to guys like Subcool.
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:10.660]  He did some amazing things and he was very passionate
[01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:13.500]  and he was doing real breeding and they did all the,
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.620]  it was all regular breeding
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:15.980]  and there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.020]  But they were breeding turps
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:18.780]  and they had the biggest frigging seeds, man.
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:20.140]  You would bust open their seed packs
[01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:22.740]  and they would have seeds that were that big.
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:25.300]  Because they did all their seed production outdoors.
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:31.970]  So, weed nerds.
[01:27:32.010 --> 01:27:35.090]  It's so funny because me and my partner, Luke,
[01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:37.450]  he was super bent out about the whole weed nerds thing
[01:27:37.450 --> 01:27:39.130]  when Subcool came out with weed nerds
[01:27:39.130 --> 01:27:42.490]  because he had come up with weed nerds in 1996.
[01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:44.770]  And I think he even made weed nerds T-shirts back then
[01:27:44.770 --> 01:27:46.210]  or something like that.
[01:27:46.210 --> 01:27:50.290]  And then Subcool did it in maybe 2004, 2005.
[01:27:50.290 --> 01:27:54.050]  And it's one of those things that a lot of people think of.
[01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:55.130]  I'm sure it wasn't Subcool
[01:27:55.130 --> 01:27:57.170]  wasn't the only one who thought about it.
[01:27:58.290 --> 01:28:00.690]  But news on the book.
[01:28:00.690 --> 01:28:03.610]  We're waiting for the publishers to get into the editing.
[01:28:03.610 --> 01:28:05.370]  So as soon as I have a little more information,
[01:28:05.370 --> 01:28:07.450]  we're gonna be covering a lot of the topics
[01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:11.130]  in the next month and a half on stuff in the book.
[01:28:11.130 --> 01:28:14.190]  So, legendary breeders, North Star Genetics.
[01:28:15.610 --> 01:28:18.530]  DJ Short, he's another, Daniel's an amazing guy.
[01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:20.890]  He's done some fun stuff and really humble.
[01:28:27.250 --> 01:28:30.450]  So, you guys want me to give out some more seed packs?
[01:28:30.450 --> 01:28:33.930]  You guys, are we done, Peter?
[01:28:33.930 --> 01:28:35.330]  Oh, maybe some autoflowers.
[01:28:35.970 --> 01:28:38.210]  How about we give some autoflowers?
[01:28:38.210 --> 01:28:39.690]  In fact, let's give out-
[01:28:39.690 --> 01:28:42.690]  Is this the Kush auto or something different?
[01:28:42.690 --> 01:28:44.490]  Yeah, we're gonna do the Kush auto.
[01:28:46.890 --> 01:28:48.730]  And because it's our last one,
[01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:53.450]  I'm gonna give away 50 seeds of the Kush auto.
[01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:54.290]  Damn.
[01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:57.930]  It's not gonna come in the fancy packaging.
[01:28:57.930 --> 01:28:59.810]  It's gonna come in the bulk packaging.
[01:28:59.810 --> 01:29:02.370]  But you will get 50 seeds.
[01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:07.610]  It won't be in the fancy Mylar bag.
[01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:08.450]  Right.
[01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:16.570]  I just got more of these too, the vials.
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:20.760]  Oh, nice.
[01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:22.680]  So yeah, so when you guys are breeding autoflowers,
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.940]  if you breed an autoflower with a photo period variety,
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:29.920]  my dog's barking,
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:31.960]  but with an autoflower with a photo period,
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.560]  so you have auto period, photo period.
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.240]  In that first generation,
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:41.320]  you have some that may express autoflower,
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:43.560]  but how many generations does it take
[01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:47.800]  before the entire progeny expresses autoflower genetics?
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:50.320]  That's the question.
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:52.360]  And so I'll go into a little more detail.
[01:29:58.770 --> 01:30:00.410]  Wait, are you going into detail now
[01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:02.050]  or at some future point?
[01:30:02.050 --> 01:30:03.890]  No, I'm waiting for some answers before we-
[01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:04.730]  Oh, got it, got it.
[01:30:04.730 --> 01:30:06.490]  Wait, so what was the question?
[01:30:07.770 --> 01:30:08.610]  There it is.
[01:30:08.610 --> 01:30:13.170]  New LFE, four generations is the true answer.
[01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:16.650]  Let's go back up to them.
[01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:17.490]  So the question was,
[01:30:17.490 --> 01:30:18.890]  how many generations does it take
[01:30:18.890 --> 01:30:21.930]  before the progeny expresses autoflower?
[01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:26.070]  New FLE, said four generations.
[01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:35.930]  So with that first generation,
[01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:37.970]  you have a, because it's a recessive trait,
[01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:41.210]  you need both of the parents to express.
[01:30:41.210 --> 01:30:43.290]  So when you have that first F1,
[01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:45.410]  you may have some that express.
[01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:48.370]  What happens with that first F1 generation,
[01:30:48.370 --> 01:30:50.290]  that F1 hybrid generation,
[01:30:50.290 --> 01:30:51.650]  you will get a shorter,
[01:30:51.650 --> 01:30:55.970]  within the F1s, you'll get a shorter flowering
[01:30:55.970 --> 01:30:58.010]  and a faster triggering plant
[01:30:58.890 --> 01:31:00.890]  that won't necessarily be an autoflower.
[01:31:02.170 --> 01:31:04.290]  But then as you go into each generation,
[01:31:04.290 --> 01:31:06.450]  once you select two of those
[01:31:06.450 --> 01:31:08.730]  and make seeds with those autoflowers,
[01:31:08.730 --> 01:31:10.070]  each time you select,
[01:31:11.010 --> 01:31:14.010]  you get more of the population to express autoflower.
[01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:15.410]  Well, it takes four generations
[01:31:15.410 --> 01:31:20.410]  before the population expresses autoflower.
[01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:22.810]  That's why you'll see people selling F4s and F5s
[01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:25.650]  of their autoflower crosses if they're made.
[01:31:25.650 --> 01:31:26.630]  I mean, some people are making them
[01:31:26.630 --> 01:31:29.530]  just from other people's autoflower stock,
[01:31:29.530 --> 01:31:31.250]  where you take an autoflower,
[01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:32.090]  cross it with the autoflower,
[01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:32.910]  you'll get autoflower.
[01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:34.250]  But if you're doing it the right way
[01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:35.990]  and you're trying to breed something
[01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:37.350]  that runs into autoflower,
[01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:38.950]  which is very difficult to do,
[01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:41.630]  I can go on and intersexual traits
[01:31:41.630 --> 01:31:42.710]  and all kinds of other issues.
[01:31:42.710 --> 01:31:46.110]  But it takes four generations
[01:31:46.110 --> 01:31:48.230]  before your plant will express autoflower,
[01:31:48.230 --> 01:31:49.830]  before your seed crop.
[01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:54.350]  So that goes to new FLE.
[01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:56.830]  That's 50 seeds of the Kush Auto.
[01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:58.670]  We'll be getting those out this week.
[01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:01.670]  Thank you guys so much for coming on.
[01:32:01.670 --> 01:32:02.990]  It's now 1235.
[01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:06.390]  Yeah, all right, so our delivery is now regular.
[01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:08.390]  It is no longer constipated.
[01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:13.190]  And for everybody in the US who's been waiting,
[01:32:13.190 --> 01:32:16.270]  all your stuff's been shipped out internationally.
[01:32:17.130 --> 01:32:19.150]  Stuff will ship out in the next,
[01:32:20.710 --> 01:32:23.250]  basically today is Sunday, so starting tomorrow.
[01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:29.530]  So anyway, James, thank you for an hour and a half.
[01:32:29.530 --> 01:32:30.370]  I gotta go.
[01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:32.910]  My two-year-old wants to take a walk right now.
[01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:35.150]  So I'm gonna go outside.
[01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:36.710]  Thank you everyone for watching
[01:32:36.710 --> 01:32:38.590]  what we thought was 20 minutes
[01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:41.030]  turned into an hour and a half.
[01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:44.990]  And I guess we'll see everyone, what, next Sunday?
[01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:46.710]  Next Sunday, I don't know who the guests are,
[01:32:46.710 --> 01:32:49.070]  but we're gonna get some more science in here.
[01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:50.550]  We're gonna try to get Ryan Lee,
[01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:53.470]  some other great people on the show.
[01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:55.750]  If you guys feel like you have a lot to contribute,
[01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:57.310]  you'd like to come on the show,
[01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:58.310]  we'd love to have you.
[01:32:58.310 --> 01:33:00.110]  Send me an email, James.
[01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:02.710]  So Scott, I have answered your question
[01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:04.510]  like 18 different times.
[01:33:04.510 --> 01:33:07.150]  So Scott, read the banner
[01:33:07.150 --> 01:33:09.830]  that I always post after your thing.
[01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:14.830]  And then in the chat, I also posted it when you last asked.
[01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:18.990]  So it's jamesloudgenetics at gmail.com.
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:27.500]  And yeah, the last winner can also use that email address.
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:30.320]  And James, you got a little packing to do.
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:32.520]  It's not gonna be too tough.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:33.360]  I got elves.
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.720]  Welcome to my world.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:36.000]  I have elves to help me out.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.760]  Yeah, I have no, my elves are too young.
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:39.920]  They need to be trained.
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:42.080]  So, all right.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:43.480]  Thank you, everyone.
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:45.000]  Yep, have a wonderful week.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:45.840]  See ya.
