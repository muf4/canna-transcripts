Hello, hello everybody. I'm excited for today. We are live and running with Sativa Creations.
Now I'm going to ask how to pronounce your name properly right off the bat because I
don't want to do it wrong with the accent. You have an Italian name. So do you want to
just go right off the bat and introduce yourself and say hello to everybody over at Future
Cannabis Project. We have a few people piling into the audience. So it'd be a good way to
get going. Yeah. Yeah. My name is Michele Modaffari. I'm an agronomist from Italy and
I'm working on Italian heirloom races, especially CBD dominant plant. Hello everybody. I'm very
happy to be here. It's really an honor and a pleasure. I hope that my English will be
enough good for you. We will catch up with a small presentation later. I'm a farmer and
agronomist and I have a farm. I grow olive trees and make olive oil. And from seven years
I make breeding on those Italian heirloom races. Was a long work for compliance and
for having good flower in order to use them for extraction and for a smokable flower market.
And was a long trip starting catching them in European certified catalogs and in European
institutions that keep the seeds and the Italian variety. We have really a long story
about cannabis variety here in Italy because it's very a long time that they will be grown
here. They was grown here and the acclimatization to different environment give us the chance
to have so many variation of those original land races that we have here. We were lucky
that those European institution and Italian institution was able to keep them also with
improper breeding techniques until us. So we don't lost our genepool and this is something
really interesting. One of my initial aims and goals was to improve those genetics and
put them back as they were before those wrong breeding techniques that will be applied just
for keeping the seeds and the variety for many years when those genetics weren't be
cultivated anymore here in Italy. If we want we could start show you my presentation because
there are some interesting data about those genetics. I would love to know a little bit like
so what was kind of the influence of cannabis in Italy because I think there's a really interesting
history point that a lot of people don't understand and that will as a North American
what this will probably help them quite a bit kind of placing the field and getting them to
Italy where it's positioned in Europe is actually the entrance point of a lot of cultures. It was
often Sicily and Southern Italy was used from Africa and India. There was a ton of that was
pretty much the trade route that everybody would come in through would be through Italy and they
would come in later through Europe and then France and then England and that was a major
portion of the trade route. So Italy is this beautiful mix of cultures in the south and in
the north and like they're just an amazing group. So I can't tell you how excited I am to speak to
an Italian about cannabis because I've just never had the opportunity to do so even in the many
travels that I've been like I traveled through Italy for like a year and a half. I lived in
Sicily for in Palermo for a couple years. I never once experienced anything when it came or
related to cannabis at that point of time. That point time I wasn't you know as in-depth of it as
I am now so I'm very excited to kind of hear the story in the background where it comes from. Now
if I'm speaking too fast let me know and I can slow down. It's okay. So can you tell me a little
bit about where kind of some of those because you talk about the land rights in your presentation.
Did you want to get into that to talk about those points? No, no, it's okay. It's fine.
Those the hemp and cannabis come from Middle East and catch Italy as first as Russia on the other
side and we could definitely say that it's a really long time, long history from Paleolithic
time. And in Italy find this close environment because Italy is a peninsula
with all the mountain on the top and so is and the sea in all the other sides. So find this
closed place where there are many different environment and the all those ancestral genetics
we could say find their place and we are cultivated for centuries for different
perspective and necessity. We have especially in the middle time, middle era, middle times
a widespread cultivation of hemp for making ropes for all equipment that are needed to ship
and for make paper. And it's very important because we don't have only
a alimentary use of the seeds but beginning of industrial production that never become
a real industry like in England or in other places in Europe in 18th century, but
was a familiar industry for many, many centuries and brings the opportunity to make paper
with the domesticated plant and to make rope and use fiber. Then obviously there is the alimentary
use that was very important due to the protein assumption that you could have with seeds,
especially for not for human alimentation, but for animals. So we can definitely say...
I was making a joke about the chickahalay, you know, they probably love to have fields in the
winter. We were chatting because last... I mentioned earlier my mother is visiting from
out of town and they're in Tuscany and they're like, they have like funny things like the Italian
culture is so... there's so much depth to every little part of the Italian culture in the Italian
way. Like even the chickahalay when the hunters come out and they're like a pesky rodent pretty
much that will go eat the grapes in the wine fields. But the farmers and the chickahalay hunters
always battle it out because the chickahalay hunters want to hunt later in the season because
when they eat all the grapes, they get all fat and they get more delicious, the chickahalay.
But the grape farmers don't want the chickahalay to last very long. Right. They want them hunted
before the grapes are there so that they don't eat all of their grapes for their wine. So I think
it's like there's so many... and with agriculturally, there are so many unique regions in Italy for,
you know, the terroir. You exactly touch the point. This ancestral variety that come from
Middle East find all these specific environment so close to each other but so different.
So we could find so many kineotypes, so many variation and in sort of inbreeded lines
in all our region. The point is that all those heirloom races, we could call them,
were a little bit ruined during the Prohibition era because the production of the seed
was not technically right and we lost some...
the quality of our genetics. And now we have the possibility because we have freedom now to grow
and to breed, we have the possibility to bring back them to the initial point. We have to say that
in 1930 there was also a breeding with the Chinese so we have a little bit messed up
the genetics. And now what we are trying to do in this new era of production of hemp, that is much
less, in my opinion, important for Italy for fiber because there is not a fiber line production in
Italy at the moment, but much more interesting for minor cannabinoids, for extraction, for
smokable use of hemp instead of tobacco. And the idea was to try to make a sort of inbreeded lines.
We cannot say that we have inbreeded lines 100% but we are really close to it.
We have still a couple of years of work to get there but we have a very good stability of our
genetics and we selected inside this gene pool all the terpene profile and the frag... and
the terpene profile that we could find there. In our hairloom races we could say that the fruit
flavor and terpene is what is very interesting because we have from peach to strawberry to lemon
to oranges, all flavor very similar to all our other productions.
Sorry I have to... It's not a good thing, go ahead, go ahead you do. This is a hell of a plant here.
This Instagram page is just absolutely gorgeous. I'm here. It's not good.
Would you like to pass to the presentation? Sure let's get on to the presentation. I did want to ask
um now it's slipped my mind a little bit so let's I do want to like define kind of what is hemp
in Italy like what exactly are the classifications and how do you guys do that
before as a preset because like we I've had a doctors on before like Dr. Anishwabe and we've
talked about the genetic difference between plants and how we identify species as as different so
other in cannabis is the only plant that we as a people have created two species out of that
doesn't have three percent change in their genetic code. The old the justified reason why
we call them separate species in North America Canada is a 0.3 percent or three percent under THC
point so it's very kind of combo it's not scientific it's it's government put up so I'd
love to know how that works. I know there's a shit ton of bureaucracy in Italy so I would love to know
kind of the little bit of that structure of legally how that that fits in and how you get
to plant such beautiful huge plants outdoors because that is not a little plant like that is
massive right that is a huge yeah so like because there must be some bureaucratic process that you
have to go through to you know yeah we have to say that we it's it's the first time where we are
first in Europe having a good law we have a good limit for THC because we could get to 0.6
in our fields obviously and the bureaucratic process it's much less than before
because we just have to have a farm a legitimate a legal farm and we could grow
without asking any permission at the end. Sometimes and often it is good to be done
we just communicate from communicate the the beginning of the production the planting
to our law enforcement but it's something more to cover farms from problems you know
but at the end we we don't have a big bureaucracy on production we just need to be farmer and we
could grow we must grow certified genetics and and this is a bit of a issue because those
certified genetics have this instability and I cannot say that are instable they are stable
but are not suited for a smokable flower market so the idea for us was to start from them
and to select and make a good breeding process in order to have better flower
huge production we have a very good pre-based strain that are the certified and
the farmer are allowed only to grow them the certified we are seed producer and
we are engaging these really bureaucratic
fields that is the certification of new genetics is what we are dealing with now
and we will see if we could be able to certify our own genetics that come from
the the certified already genetics but need several year of test for stability and for compliance
so we could say that for one time here in Italy we are open to this cultivation and we have good
limits and good limits especially for THC.
That is so like it's it's very interesting and the certification process is a challenge and I
see like you got to work with the framework that you have right and the bureaucracy is no small
thing to Gauca in Italy when it comes down to doing anything in the world when it comes to them
so I do not envy your challenge I look forward to the the results.
Don't think about because also for certification are European laws so at the end it's the same
process as in any other country of Europe so we could say that also for certification we are
at the same point as the other country in Europe.
Okay so it's an EU total it's not just Italy has its own separate interest.
No no the integration especially in agriculture in the European law it's a really high
integration so we have all the same rules this is something very good and I think that it's
something that is moving also our country and our farmers and our scientists to
achieve better results because we are not so long we are no longer stopped by
internal bureaucracy and this is something very good and I could say that things are moving
also here in Italy in the last years especially after Covid because the government
realized this necessity to be fast to be smart and to try to do new things and cannabis is
something really important in that case and I really think that things will move forward for Italy fast.
Do you think it's they're going to be like I've always like the Italians are kind of like wacky
sometimes and I kind of no offense I mean it in all the love in the world but I fight like I've
always kind of theorized that Italy is just going to come out of left field like before anybody else
does out of nowhere just like hey I'm totally going for it but do you think like does it have
to be European legalized or can Italy itself be go ahead or do you think Germany is going to be
the first country to go legalize like what's the process there because as a North American I don't
know as much about it as I would like. I don't know I don't know I think that this path is begin
for all European country for sure if there are some huge countries Germany that move forward
to total legalization of cannabis will be a challenge also for other countries I don't
think that in the near future this will be something real I think that is much more probable
that we will in Italy will be allowed the homegrown cultivation for THC in a couple of
years this I definitely think that will could happen. All right do you want to get into that
sorry I cut you off there or you'll go to say. No I think that
this point of legalization will be something that will become real very soon I don't know when
because there are huge forces against it yet but it's a wave that is moving so I guess that things
will be better for all of us in Europe but I want to underline this that the difference between
countries in Europe are much less important because we have common regulation and things
are moving where there is an European regulation as for cannabis. Cannabis our law it's a little
bit better for hemp sorry it's a little bit better than other European country for compliance
but the start of this regulation comes from the European law and it was good that the Italian
government gave us the chance to work in a little bit more easy compliance limit that's it.
I go I start with the presentation I show you something some point we have already
touched them full screen there we go
I don't know your your your English is excellent as well by the way I'm very tired today
you're doing wonderfully as you can see here our mission is the improvement and maintenance of
Italian hemp hair and braces as we as we say before Italian variety I have a long story
there is these funny things funny thing of aplotype that explain exactly what we said before
that the hemp get to Italy long time ago and find this environment that was closed
from outside influence and this is underlined by this genetic market that help us to understand
the aplotype help us to understand how the cannabis moves from China from Indian to
from China to the rest of the of the world and as we said there are a huge number of ecotype
the ecotype it's very important in my opinion because is the concept that explain
biodiversity of hemp strain in Italy all these different environment
closed from sea to maintain with different condition permit permit this variety to
make different ecotypes and this is the source of genetics where we start with
here you could see the hemp production in all of Europe and you could see that in Italy we are the
second after Russia and we are really a small country really small country and in this why
is the reason is that was really a cultivation that all family does in 18th century and in
the beginning of the 19th century also without very good production because you could see
that the average of production factor it's the double respect to Russia
I can't I can't like be like I understate the the amazing like microclimates and little regions of
of ecosystems and climates that all of Italy has like you go from province province it's like a
different world like even how everybody behaves is culturally it's very diverse so you can literally
go down yeah yeah this was our biggest issue yeah but that cultural diversity is also part of
I think it's influenced greatly by the ecotype because each region has such a different variety
of things that go well for them right like yeah in the north it can get quite cold but like you
know and in the south it's warm all the time you know and then in Sicily you pretty much all year
round warm it never gets below zero very frequently anyways so it's like there's it's a small country
with a massive amount of diversity I think it's like smaller than California as a whole and it's
got more ecodiversity in it than anywhere right it's insane sorry to interrupt there but I just
had to no no no no I'm very happy that you say so because underline what we are saying before
and explain all these kenya type diversity and all these ecotype diversity that we have in a such a
small country as we are we are saying before we have got this decline of cultivation in Italy and
all over the world especially after World War II and in this period we have got the biggest loss
of variety we were lucky to have those state center of research that maintain the varieties
maybe not always in the perfect way but permit permit this permit us to have
the majority part of our variety now to start with now we could see the genotype
identification this graphic is the distribution of data of THC and CBD in our variety in 1990
as you could see we have chemotype 1 chemotype 2 and chemotype 3 so in our work
the chemotype 1 was already taken away from the gene pool and we start with the variety that have
chemotype 2 and chemotype 3 and we have got to select and segregate the most malfunctional
btgene in the population gene in the population with mass selection and a lot of
back crossing as I told before we don't have a real inbreeded line but every year that pass
we get closer to this point to have total segregation in first about btgene but also
for all the other characteristic genetic characteristics you're breeding only outdoor
no no we breed we breed uh although we make selection and test fields outdoor greenhouse
and indoor because here there is a developed specialized production of CBD flower
in all in all the possibilities of production so in greenhouses mostly but also indoor
and a lot of outdoor also for extraction so the breeding that I do it's only greenhouse and
outdoor the place where I bred but the test fields were done in all the different possibility of
grow in order to be able to give the proper data to every kind of grower
here there are our results on our main genetics that is a population that is ends of buddha
we call we call it like this and we have a compliant thc under 0.3 the cbd is not very high
but it's difficult to have higher cbd and be compliant but we have this interesting presence
that we are much more development developing now the cbg and the cbc
uh that are minor but are very interesting in my opinion because we will be able to make new lines
pure in cbg there are already from perugina that is an italian variety and the cbc we are working on
having pure line cbc dominant that is something for the future
turpin expression as we say before our benchmark our benchmark for production was
production of flower for a smokable market because we really think that hemp it's interesting
as an analog of tobacco and to cover this production so we have to in our selection we have
to try to have the best turpin expression in our genepool and this was done in the normal
in the traditional breeding not without using new technology because in the last year
was very expensive and we decided to do the
standard breeding
but in the future we will be able to use mass and use genetic marker to make breeding much faster
and much easier so we found in our population strawberry peach and lemon and orange as
principal principal flowers and we will be able to separate them in the last
seed run seed run for production making a g1 because the market wants feminized seeds
and we decide to make those in order to be to have happy customers so what do you i'm not familiar
with g1 being used as a term uh very frequently you define that a little bit maybe it's a you know
yeah this is genoic genoic it means made by females okay okay greek yeah make by females
so when you make a feminized seeds you use two females to make it so g1 g1 is the first
generation and the best is that you do only this generation because if you make other generation
feminized non-feminized you lost all the power of the plant of the vigor of the plant that is
something where we worked a lot on the quality of the plant for production so is vigor is root
system is structure because after compliance interesting minor cannabinoids terpene profile
the rest is structure and vigor of the plant as you say before we have big plant that produce a
lot of flower and this is very interesting especially for extraction use but now we
found out also that this big production of flowers means also a big production of seeds
so we are making tests also for seed production because a good variety a good population have to
be able to make more different production so g1 is genoic and it means made by females
for the selection of the structure our first point was root system this is a photos of our
root system that we want to have and that we find inside this
gene pool and it's very important for the dry climate but it's also when you dig into the
severity of that climate a bit for me like in the because i think this is a really super important
point for italy and there's some really hot and dry periods that some of the area gets into
whether like the high temps and and the periods of dryness because there's been some
harsh summers over the last one that's like decimated crop like decimated it right
now we have big problem with the dry climate now for example this winter rain very very low
and the rain is the first point to don't become a desert so having plant that have a top root system
and not a globular system of roots it's very important because allow the plant
to go deep in the soil and find water there here in italy we have big trouble with water especially
this year because it's not raining anymore we lost 50 percent or more of the total year of rain
and having plant that are acclimatized to dry climate is very important i prefer seeds
respect clones because we could pass to the to the to the next generation to the to the small
plant that we are going to plant these top root system that is very important for many reason
a root is important for a big big yield and productivity and also to support the structure
if you don't have a good root system especially the top root system
the plant will fall when it's full of flower and you need to to help her help her to don't crash
it's necessary to do that sometime especially where there is a big wind but this kind of root
are very interesting because give you the chance to grow also in a in a dry climate
this photo is it's interesting because this is our structure all our plant at this big structure
big structure think about that these
plantation these fields were done without water only with rain we have to say that this place is
a special place on alps that have some rainy days also during the summer and allowed these
farmers that work with us to grow without water and having very good results
the structure that's phenomenal that's a beautiful plant no hand watering like what are they is it
like just just you know the fertile italian soil okay just no feed or anything they just
what are they no in that case this is this is an alpine soil that wasn't be cultivated for a long
time have a good capacity to keep moisture this kind of soil but we could definitely say
that in this study case that we have done on alps this was our fields one close to be 1000
meter to the sea level and they feed just a little bit with horse manure
for the beginning and give some water for the first month then the plant and the environment
have done all alone i know that it's something not so usual because the area it's a place where
there is rain sometimes during the winter the summer enough to let the plant produce flower
and to grow it's not something for sicily or for colorado it's something for this possibility to
grow in this way where there are the proper condition it's possible as we say before the
structure we select for a lignified structure to support the plant in order to have heavy production
and good health both for dry flower biomass and seeds as i told you before now i show you some
flowers this is the orange fennel that we locked in our orange buddha and all those come from the
same population inbreeded the population and then at the last step we separate those phenotypes
that are the unique that we got at the end of back crossing and inbreeding process
and the flower are not so different one to the other but mostly it's the terpene profile
get to three percent if it's well cultivated and this is the orange here we have the strawberry
strawberry before just if you go back to the last one did i see purple pistols on that on that orange
that's gorgeous
that's not doesn't occur in 100 of orange plant but in a good 50 percent oh nice nice nice yeah
yeah and depend also on the temperature so for example you see we have grown
the orange buddha in sicily and you have much less in that case was always in a mountain place
where we we get to this result then we have strawberry strawberry is the phenotype in this
population more frequent and it's a very interesting flower with the these strawberry
undertones it's very very interesting we could say that strawberry was somehow the mother of
all the others because at the beginning this heirloom this variety have mostly strawberry but
we will get to all these other only through inbreeding process so
it get out get out also these other phenotypes that are interesting like the lemon the lemon
it's a very good flower with a lot of resin on top and have these characteristic
lemon flavor and it's interesting so are we like are we like lemon cello are we lemon candy like
what because lemon is such a range for me it can be anywhere yeah dried old grandma lemon to like
you know like fresh lemon cello to like yeah it's it's more fresh lemon cello as an idea because
there is sweet and lemon in the same is not a harsh lemon you know it's interesting also but
my favorite one is the peach the peach come out from a citrus bergamia phenotype because we carried
out this citrus bergamia phenotype for many years and we goes on with the selection but at the last
it turn in peach you know what it is citrus bergamia
no we call it bergamotto oh bergamot yes yeah yeah yeah yeah these citrus bergamia phenotypes
it's very interesting but turned in the peach that is also more um more more interesting for
the market because citrus bergamia is a bit have some bitter inside it's a little bit
difficult to be understand understood you know but we have got this luck that it turns
in peach that is very interesting because there are not so many variety in the world with the
peach flavor so that'll do so well in italy too when you like just the amount of peach
things when it comes to like peach soda peach juice it's very common like when you see it you
see it everywhere in the markets there's peach in everything when it's available um so i can see that
just exploding in the italian market yeah we could say that somehow those variety have the terpene
profile of our fruit you know that's interesting because it's something that talk about our
environment and the fact that all our production have somehow the same characteristics you know
it's something interesting here there is a shoot of dry flower very dense and very well done
so as we said before fields of application are smoke extraction and seed production
now we have what i like more that is the biosynthetic pathway of cbd and thc and all
the other minor cannabinoids it's interesting because we could have also this variation of
cbdv thcv cbgv that is something where we are working on not with big results i think that
there will be other breeders around the world that will be able to have pure lines with the variants
sooner than us but we are trying to fix this also in our variety because the interesting part
of the chemotype in my opinion is that once we have good pre-base and we have good structure
and we have good root system and we have good phenotype for terpene profile we try to move
uh only this
this point to have the same flower with different cannabinoids inside that is what
is the biggest challenge for us and for me this is interesting because we could see that we have
these three four genes the first one is the one that intervene in the production of
varying cannabinoid or normal cannabinoid and then we have the bd that is the one that
is the involved in the production of the cbd and the bt the bt is the one where we focused more
because we don't want to have a lot of thc as we saw in the first at the beginning of the
presentation our heirloom races are inside type one so we have to exclude this and we have to
be we have to be able to select variety with the dysfunction of this gene because this gene is
inside the plant we cannot take them away and we don't want to take it away we want just to select
the one that produce much less of this synthetizer in order to have less thc
so what would happen in it like in italy if you had production and there was too high of a thc
content in your final product there are two different possibilities the first possibility
is that your thc is grown up maybe for dry condition or for genetic instability
or something else and you get to one percent two percent and you get caught by police when they
come to check and to verify the thc presents in your cultivation in that case you have just to
throw your fields away you have to cut all and burn instead if they find that the thc level
is get high and high you know and maybe they have the suspect that you don't have plant
hemp seeds in that case it's much worse it's a conviction yeah yeah they they try to do this
but it's not something so often because farmer as i am and many other are
that we decided to start the journey in the cbd dominant plant and to try to take this opportunity
to grow again hemp we don't want to mess up you know so it's not something that happened so often
where there are illegal cultivation they don't go to the police and say i'm growing hemp you know
because it's it's without sense then we have the bz b0 that is the other gene
where there's no production of other cannabinoids that are not cbg so all the other stepway
it means that are not functional or not functional at all or misfunctional but strongly
and these are cbd cbg dominant plant that we have in our
genepool as you could see also at the beginning of the presentation also and
also our genetics have one percent of cbg because trying to get bt misfunctional
obviously we have much more cbg at the beginning that don't get to the rest of the biosynthetic
pathway then we have here up on the right the cbc that is the the last of the genes
for cannabinoids that is the one where we are trying to do something because we detach
a good presence of cbc in many italian variety is not something that occur so often but
i'm personally fascinated by his potential for medical use also if there are not so many
studies yet on cbc but i'm trying to select and
and hybridize variety in order to have a cbc dominant plant it's a bit of challenge let's
see what will happen maybe in the future when in the early future where we are going to use
genetics assisted breeding and genetic marketer markers sorry we will be able to make these
variety pure for cbc production true we we will see here are some partner of us
in united states oku seeds that are selling our seeds in in america and giving bridge for
virginia so oku for seattle side and the giving bridge for the south region of united states
and here our sativa creation contact and that's it
i close it yeah go ahead close it go ahead close it up we'll sneak we'll snoop through your
instagram a little bit because i some of these photos are absolutely just just just stunning
and we got to show them off a little bit because these plants are absolutely gorgeous so it seems
like it's not that difficult to actually be able to grow there are police actually checking
um the like farms and testing the product and what does that look like for your everyday person like
is it like oh there's the cabin area coming around the corner with an angry look or is it like you
know something something a little bit different no it's something easy because uh it's obviously
that depend on you uh in which type of relation that you build with them it's very important in
my opinion to build a good relation with with law enforcement because in this explication of our
civil rights to grow it it's necessary to have a good behavior and a good relation with law
enforcement in the for what i know from my experience they just call you a few weeks
before that they come to make some sample using the european law for making sample that is very
important to have an accurate way of taking sample and it's something easy it's something easy in my
in my in my personal opinion and in my experience
it's a it's a it's a moment where also law enforcement have back the opportunity to
see how it is and m fields and there is this normalization you know of this production that is
something very important in my opinion because when we ask to have freedom to work with this
plant is important to understand that we are asking for a civil right to make this no and
this must be inside the law you know and have to be done with police because it's the unique way to
to talk with them and also them understand that is not drug that is something that have a meaning
that have a meaning and that is important for for people because we cannot forget the importance of
CBD for the everyday life of a lot of people for his medical opportunity that this plant give to us
so i think that obviously the the feedback that you will have from law enforcement depend on you
so it's very important to be open to don't mess up and
to make the normalization of this process and this feeling through to the the plant and the
cultivation i see now italy has one of the the biggest like one of the most one of the countries
that have done some of the most research in cannabis whatever medicinally is actually it
yeah is is one of the leaders in cannabis so what where are they getting the herb that the government
is or or maybe that the medical system is using for these tests are they searching for farmers
like yourself are they sourcing from other countries what's how do they get a hold of the
product that they're using in the case of scientific study on THC variety there are
actually there are already producer in italy allowed to produce it for the government we allow
with and so there is this production also of type one in italy for medical use we have already
from i think 10 years this medical law for production is very strict because
the production of flowers and or isolated or whatever they need to use for medical use
is very pharmaceutical so it's uh it's not it's not something for farmers no definitely
uh but we could say that scientific
institute could grow it the law allow it and they could also get this material from the producer
that are allowed to do this in italy for CBD dominant plant obviously they come to farmers
uh in order to have the product to make analysis or all the kind of research
that they want to do so i think i think that we have a start of all of this in italy
and do you think like so you said there is a medical program there like what's the level of
medical program like for me i give you hey i'm add give me a medical card for 100 for
for a couple hundred bucks and i can grow 100 plants like what's the medical program look like
there they are they like you're allowed to the medical program is that if you have a illness
that is recognized where it's possible to use cannabis to cure it to on it you could buy it
in the pharmacy at the beginning there was only product from abroad from holland or from swiss
and now we have our own production through the military in florence and now we have a couple of
other private companies that are producing here in italy but i think definitely that in the future
will be much much more developed this possibility but as i told you before it's not something for
farmers it's something for big companies for pharmaceutical production it's something that
is very strictly and regulated and need huge investments so i don't think that in the early
future this opportunity to grow for medical use will be allowed for farmers for example one point
is that have to be all grown in door that is something that i don't i could argue about it
but it's like this and the other point is that you need all these you have to be a pharmaceutical
company only pharmaceutical company are allowed to produce in italy but it's already something you
know it's already something is the beginning now there was this opportunity that the government
want to vote for allowed people to grow four five plant each but is not still past this but i think
that this will be the next step because on the medical side medical production as i told you is
for for a big company pharmaceutical industry but i think that we'll be able we will be able to produce
for ourself in the in not so long time because it's something that people want people is asking
you know we have more than 10 million of daily consumer in italy it means that one person every
six it's a it's a buyer and a consumer a customer you know one in every six
yeah that's a that's pretty high that's a lot higher than i would have expected for for italy
you know yeah there's so much like you see so much influence of the church and stuff in a lot of
spaces that you you instantly think that it's very very you know conformative of a space of
a country really it's not this was the past yeah this was the past but uh in in the next in in the
in the young people it's very they are very suited for this new culture you know because
is globalization you know we are all the same somehow there is the bad side and there is the
good side like in like all things you know but from this from for this point i think that the
church have a big influence for sure but there is this people is asking to have this think about
that few weeks ago there was they asked to to make a vote a popular vote to legalize cannabis
the government not allowed to do it for some
we don't know why but they don't allow this but it was a strong push from the people
to ask the government to have a little bit more freedom on this thing you know
can you tell me a little bit about this field here that i i brought up on it can you see it
yeah yeah this is this is one of my fields here in liguria close to france is a land all
with all around the woods it's close to the river and this is one of the test fields i did
a couple of years ago where you could see this was the s2 generation so was the second
inbreeding on on the population so we were at the at the middle of of the work on this population
and was a nice production of flower for italian market and a test on our variety
here we have ends of boon ends of buddha as it was as a population so you have a plant that is
orange a plant that is citrus bergamia at the time a plant that was strawberry all mixed together
then to realize a product for farmers that want to be specialized in flower production
we split all these phenotype and we made a pure batch of the same phenotype from a unique plant
in order to have stability and to have and to have a stability on the terpene expression
because as i saw around in farms it's important for for who produce flower to have
all the same type and so we did it with the genoic one population
awesome so i so you said you're you've got you're at market and you're selling like this hemp the
smokable hemp flower and market um like can you talk to me about because you just blew my mind
because i just i i now i just imagine walking into a store in italy when i go to visit and going to
there are yeah yeah so can you tell me like is there specific stores for it or you go to the
corner store and they have it there like is it like boutique yeah yeah at the beginning we have
got shops of us uh to sell and then the market have trouble because too many decide to produce
now we mostly export our flowers to france where there is a better market in italy we we have
some shop in the north in milan that have our flowers but definitely this year will be much
more because there are many farmers in italy that are buying our seeds to produce and
uh will be present on the market so there are many ways to buy our our hemp flowers
the first one is to catch up with us and to talk with us directly
the the first shop and the one that have hands of buddha now in milan is green town that is a
a old grow shop of milan with a long story and it's possible to buy them there our flowers
but we are losing the we are going away from the production of flowers slowly slowly
to be focused on seeds 100 because we are a small company we are a startup
we we could say that definitely and we want to make things right and to make things right
we have to be focused and don't do too many things you know so i think that in the future
there will be farmers growing our strain as before also in the last year there were many many farmers
that decide to produce hands of buddha in italy but also abroad and with good results
i want to underline this point that is very important for farmers
the compliance 0.3 thc is a very difficult border because it's a milligram of difference to be
inside or outside the border i know that there are a lot of farmers that want to
have these compliant flowers to be sold everywhere in europe and i understand this
what i always say to farmers is that our genetics are suited to make this thc level
in certain conditions the condition have to be properly feed have to be they need to have the
proper amount of water they don't have to be stressed because the stress increased 10 thc
level that it's enough to get out from 0.3 the other very important thing for farmers that want
to stay on this limit is to make analysis before harvest starting from the from the sixth week
and in order to understand the proper moment where to harvest
to have ripen flower but the the proper thc level because it's in 10 days you could get to 0.33
we never went over 0.35 okay also in very harsh condition as sicily where we have a big farm that
work with us and that produce all smokable flowers from our genetics but it's not only
the genetics it's also a work that have to be done by the the farmers a proper cultivation
without any kind of stress and the the point of choose the right moment where to harvest
as us in united states the compliance is at seven week okay we could definitely go to eight week but
not long not over because if you go over and you have a overripe or really mature flower
you you get a little bit higher not so much but enough to have trouble
so okay this is interesting because like just my i mentioned earlier that my family is visiting
from italy and italy has like some ridiculously cheap properties in farmland like i was looking
at a at a place that this is the point of reference for here like like a tiny little
lot with a tiny little house on it here in vancouver that you can't even live in you'd
have to tear it down and bring it and just like i mean like an eighth of an acre tiny tiny little lot
is like 2.3 million dollars um and and i was like looking at some places you can get like a couple
acres for 200 000 with a nice villa on it in italy and now you're telling me that it that you can grow
hemp and then sell it to the market is it a challenge to get licensing um for an italian
citizen to to produce hemp to sell on the market there's no license you have no license no there's
no license you have to be a farm that it means for our laws that you have to have enough land
uh to pay taxes as a farm so have to be your principal income 55 of your income 60 of your
income have to come from the production this is the point that is a regulation more due to taxes
because farms in europe pay much less taxation because its primary production have an importance
as we are seeing now with the war in ukraine how is important to have our production in our
country also because for different reason and there is this opportunity to pay less less taxes
the government allowed you also to make a second work because they know that
living only of agriculture is not easy but 60 of your income have to come from there
in that case you are a farm and you have the opportunity to grow hemp for private people
depend on places the law the law doesn't say anything about private and home growers
there are a lot obviously someone have got some problem really small and depend where you are
and depend always what i tell you what i told you before um the the kind of connection that
you get with the law enforcement it's very important because it's your it's your right
to grow a plant that don't produce thc but you have to deal with them in the proper way that
means talk with them explain and find the solution because they continue control on on on this
production so it's better to do that with them and not against them this is my personal opinion
so okay so so those that don't like a point of perspective every once a week in in in the city
and in italy you have all the farms will usually come up and do like the outdoor markets right
they'll do their you'll sell their cheese they'll sell their vegetables from the farm
some of them are clothing sometimes but there's always regular markets and pretty much every
city all throughout yeah so as a farmer as a primary license holding farmer i could produce
you know some vegetables some some stuff and then i could also produce hemp and sell that at my stall
in the in the town center yeah absolutely okay like cdi dc said it correctly i'm working on
my citizenship at the moment you're gonna see me like in no time yeah i mean in choosing the proper
genetics for the environment that you will choose and we could be in contact in this community of
producer here in italy for sure yeah i would i would love to like i'm planning i'm planning on
coming out next year um so we will be connecting every year i'll come out for a visit come to me
oh of course multibanded um i will i will have to cook for you as a chef or a lifestyle so
i wanted to just like so you said huku seeds is a collaborator that you work with out here right
so what what lie like do you do you provide some of their lines do they have they use your genetic
to develop develop some of their own stuff they have all the lines that i have in in my catalog
so those four and uh they will use them for sure for make whatever they want because our work is
open source we think that we are trying to improve this italian variety but have to be spread
everywhere and yes we definitely will try to make some outcross with uh with other genetics
thanks to the stability that we get and i think that the hands of buddha is a very good
prebase because the biggest work was done on structure top root system and all the things
that we discussed before and all these characteristics are in all the plant that we
have and this is something very good we bring up these these characteristics from 96 to 98
uh and it's good it's good yes people can purchase huku seeds and they would be supporting you as
well in the process yeah exactly that's pretty awesome i actually have your page
here that you brought i want to see if i can zoom this in a little bit better because i'd love to
talk about these specifically a bit yeah here i am here i have to say thanks to to my friends and my
people that work with me one is jenna cruz that is an artist an italian artist living in new york
that make the mandala and this mandala serie have got good results
and i'm very happy for this and the other one is my advisor for graphic and design and all of
these things that is michele mezzano that is also a breeder and helped me out in my breeding programs
is a partner of sativa creation and they will be able to do all of this that i like very much
the mandala serie but it's something that is not is not for me i work much more with genetics you
know this is awesome and we love having the guys that do the work on the show that's the best part
of it yeah i have to say thank you i have to say thank you to hoku seeds to have got to give me the
chance to get out in the united states it's a very good guy floyd and we have a good relation i want
to say something also on giving bridge that is a small company in virginia that it start growing
hands of buddha and promoting it in virginia that it's a very interesting state
because they are trying to move from tobacco to hemp and i'm trying to do all that i can
in order to give the chance to those farmer in in west virginia and west virginia
through the help of this good friend that is bred from the green bridge
because the idea was to to to build a bridge you know the built a bridge for genetic works
built a bridge in the atlantic ocean between europe to united states
that is something that it's very important for me
um well no one hears of italian heirloom genetics like and i know that there's no possible way
like culturally where italy is located their culture and the separate cultures that are there
and the separate regions out of there it it it dawned on me when you first messaged me i think on
instagram it it dawned on me like there has to be a bunch of heirlooms there has to be some unique
varieties that are coming out of this space there has to be it's it's impossible for there not to be
but no one fucking talks about it um and and that's kind of one of those things that drives me
nuts so and do you know why because these producer of cbd don't understand that our uh focused
our focus don't have to be to make our industry as the american one for thc we are not making this
we are making something different something else that start from our variety pool because all cbd
variety come from certified variety in europe from starting to the auto flowering in russia
and and and to the italian to the sweden varieties as finola and all start from there
inside there there is all the variation all the the possibility in this gene pool of certified
certified european variety obviously for my point was easy i'm in italy i don't buy a russian
variety to put it in a dry climate you know i start with what i have but not because it's italian
no but because it's an agronomist and it's suited for growth here so the point was at the beginning
to take those variety make them better and acclimatize for my farm this was the beginning
then slowly slowly i realized i started i have to say that that for me it's a patient
is my patient i pass most of my free time reading trying to understand genetics trying to understand
what's there is inside this fantastic code and but the beginning was just to make it for me
you know but then i realized that the idea to become a keeper of those variety and improve them
to a different use that is not longer paper okay i hope that will start paper production
start with hemp but it is not real no what's there is real is that hemp is used as an analog of
tobacco on an alternative to tobacco and is used for extraction of cannabinoids for medical use
and so we have to that is what we we have to do on our genetics genetics come from the past
from the necessity of the men of the past and get to us with all their quality and all
their disadvantages and we have to to to modify them in order to catch the goal of what we need
now not the paper of 14th century you know exactly exactly it's got to fit into what you're trying to
do now and what actually works with your community and stuff you know i would love to see um the the
hemp like this the leftover products the roots and shoots if they're not going to be left in the
ground to you know feed back the soil to be put into pulp production um or something like that i
think i think it's really cool italy's got a fantastic uh like local food slow food movement
as well when it comes to your farming practices when it comes to the the way that you guys move
food something like i read a stat that something like uh nine ninety percent or it's fifty percent
of people in italy for christmas eat food that comes from within italy uh the 25 percent eat
food within 100 kilometers of where they're located uh for christmas and the last 25 percent
is actually people that eat food from their own region and only their own region so everything
from olive to flour is produced within 10 kilometers of their home and that's just like
that's that you can't even if you tried to you would have challenges doing that here in canada
it wouldn't work um so there's this amazing opportunity where you have this beautiful
slow food culture movement this this this amazing farm movement as well as this movement of cannabis
and this almost it's almost that like as long as you're staying in the hemp variety and under the
thc space it sounds almost like an open market like you can yeah reduce your flour and you can
go to the fucking market and you can sell it like every other you go to you go to the if you guys
it look through any video walking through a market in town italy and you see big barrels of olives
like i could just see like big barrels of all of the all these candies and then there's your
weed guy with his vegetables you know like how awesome does that sound to be a part of it
definitely it brings me that was the last four years was a struggle because there were
in the state and in in law enforcement the idea to stop us and they tried many times
but we get through this all the trials that were open especially for who don't produce because our
law it's very made for producer okay so if you are a producer you are much more covered as you
know obviously there is a lot of people that only buy it and sell it specialized shops that do this
as a commercial activity in that case they will be a little bit more on the border and they've got
trouble but they are still there in the sense there there was there were trials me too i was
in trial many times with my products in other shops you know but after chemical analysis
and after scientists that say this is not drug no because it's something that is
uniform for science that is not drug you know they send us home because there's no opportunity to
to so it was a struggle okay when we say that it's an open market it's true we are working
there is a lot of people working we have also weight economically now but there is always these
other tendencies to try to stop us but if we are close together with our
if we are close together in this fight we could get through this without any problem and we could
definitely say that in Italy there are a lot of producers a lot of sellers there are a lot of
shops in all our city Rome Milan Florence whatever and we starting from these roles
from this law we take the action to do this and take also some risk not stupid one to the
opportunity to have this right to produce it sell it and consume it that is already something
because in my idea as you said before as the church influence that we have in our culture
at the same time the normalization of this process of production selling and consuming
it's very important because gives to the people that are not interested in what we do
that are older or are not in the same mood that we are could understand that it's something normal
that is not drug that is not related to criminality or whatever instead we have
this production of CBD take out a lot of market to unlegals you know because also many
that consume THC type one especially of a certain age as I am decided to use this other kind of
product that give you much more focus on what you are doing because we have family we have to work
it's a different target I'm not one that talk often about the market because it's not my
biggest point what I really know but I understand from the beginning as a customer as a consumer
that it's a different target respect type one and also type two it's a target of people
that use it in the past that decided to don't use it anymore for many reason but still have
the happiness of consuming cannabis and in doing this enjoy CBD that is very interesting
because don't get too high but get you focused on what you are doing and relax you relax you
all the terpene that we have inside our variety of an entourage effect so
we have benefit in doing this as as customer
and there is that respect you know like if you are establishing a market you are given
a pretty much free and open position as long as you follow within these guidelines that you
work with as long as you maintain this basic premise of structure you have a pretty open
fair space to play in so it's like following making sure everybody following that rule
will lead to everything else being available it's like a tax on the market
everything else being available it's like a test run right like people they will have to see what
it is right and once they get that part into their culture once they understand that they that you
can that grandma who has arthritis in her hands and is in pain can consume funny thing no that
all people recognize it because they grow it in the past everywhere and this and and we told them
this is the drug that was this was drug in the past was considered
this drug you know and they were shocked because they never understood that this was cannabis you
know because for them is a normal plant that grow in their gardens in their fields for many many
years i have a grandmother that now it's dead it was very old from the last century we could say
uh that when i told to her that we are doing this the beginning was very scary
because said to me you are you want to to grow drugs and it is it's like u.s prisons canadian
prisons they're they're not great but like i would never want to be stuck in an italian prison
like that would not that is not you're not like it's not a great place to be
it so yeah i could understand it's not a great place to be and this is for sure
uh there are wars worst around the world but are not the best one of the civil war
world world uh i have i have family i have children i cannot do things that put me in danger
in that way and anyway i did i decided to do this because there was a legal opportunity to do this
uh having 99 probability to don't have any kind of trouble not to get to a jail we never thought
about this we at least we have thought to be suited and and to have some trouble with
lawyers and spending money this was our biggest problem in our mind but there is a law that allow
us to do this say to us how we have to do this there is the control and we are very happy to be
controlled because if we are controlled we are inside the law and we don't have any trouble
you know and this is the situation where mostly of us decided to do that because
was something that they love was something that they want to do but there was the legal opportunity
to do this without having trouble and the italians are such passionate people you know
let's just go for something 100 if they can if they have the ability to do that how was the
acceptance of that older generation that generation that grew up past the point of uh this is a two
part question past the point of when hemp was kind of removed culturally from the market born after
that point into the world drugs and then came up and still kind of have that stipulation do you find
there's breakdown there's cultural differences or is it going to be like kind of a waiting game wait
for them to pass and then we'll have no there is there is a line that is reconnecting because they
never understood all the people that this was a drug they never realized what it was okay but
they know that this wasn't something bad okay so this funny thing that i was telling before about
my grandma what happened often is that they understood for the first time seeing us cultivating
it again that this was the drug told by the government okay and they refuse this this subject
you know this aim this point that was a drug because they always have cultivated it you know
and say me also my father grow it and the father of my father so it's something that is reconnected
to our culture after this stupid break that we get on these uh
without sense war on drugs where we are talking about hemp which is not a drug yeah exactly
and so with that with that history that oh like it's weird that we're getting rid of it because
my grandma grew this and my mother grew this and my grandma grandma's grandpa's dude grew this
so are we we know that regularly in cannabis cultivation historically cannabis is very
capable of escaping into the environment from farms are there like if you go for a walk in the
countryside are you going to find rural cannabis there is that something that's there or has they
been eliminated no no no it was completely destroyed from every environment by police
and by farmers being paid for cut everything so there are no place in Italy where it's possible to
find it natural okay also because was a production that was done by the man so it could escape a
little bit but not so much because if for hundred and hundred years the seeds are taken out by men
and put in the soil by men these are domesticated variety that it's different in the places in the
world where it grow where cannabis grow by himself have different characteristics for example as
something that seemed to me not so important and how much time the seeds stay inside the flower
is very important our variety that are domesticated the seeds fall down immediately
and this is not good because all the birds will eat it so it's something that cannot stay in nature
alone then in some places could be that you will find one but are much more related to
some people in 1960-1970 that goes to the river and throw seeds inside by a purpose to have plants
everywhere okay yeah more like that there's that period of during prohibition when there was and
you'd have people planted legally and they would bring genetics in from all over the place so you
might find something but it would probably be maybe in that kind of did you say there are people
throwing seeds to just kind of like have them grow there was there was in the past there are some
some places where people do this for example to be able to grow the illegal one they throw
many many seeds of hemp in in the river in order to have full of hemp everywhere
and could grow in in the middle of this some THC lines but as I told you before also in these cases
is the human that put that seeds in nature but those variety it's difficult that they reproduce
themselves alone as it was I don't know 10 000 years ago for example one of one of the
characteristics of the beluchistan or afghanistan variety these big seeds that stay inside the flower
and if you go there you could see a plant growing from from the flower this is something that is a
characteristic of very old variety that are not domesticated by them in every kind of
variety of also tomato or whatever it's difficult that those variety could grow alone because are
too many hundred years that have us working to promote their development in the nature so we
could definitely say that wild nature doesn't exist anymore and what we recognize as wild nature
it's something that is made by man it's something that have the hand of the man deciding what to
plant and what to don't to don't plant and this is something that we could find in the genetics
because they don't have anymore the capacity to grow by themselves they are selected to grow with
us with our help and in cannabis we could see it much more than in other variety for this point of
the falling the fall of the seeds in the soil and and many other for example one small trick that we
use to choose the the proper variety to carry on is exactly this point of the natural
reproduction where when when we produce seeds and some of those seeds fall in the in in the land
and only a few of them grow by by themselves and they are much more rustic and much more
suited for that environment so sometimes we use this capacity of the plant to grow by themselves
uh alone without our help to select her but in my experience it's difficult that it could happen in
a large scale and in a scale in in in situation where there is a huge competition for the
possibility to grow in a situation where there's not the man that is working on them
so for example in my area i'm surrounded by woods it's very difficult that the plant go
it's able to grow inside the woods for example so i have a barrier you know from the the possibility of
um of uh escape the genetics from the cultivated land
that that is a gorgeous field right there that just looks absolutely stunning um so like do you
what because i mean you you've seen a fair bit of future cannabis project and kind of some of the
things there i would love to know like we mentioned shingolay earlier and then coming and eating the
grapes yeah are there any weird like maybe uniquely italian hemp growing issues like it
is there like like do they come in there and try and eat all your seeds or is there something
unfortunately we have exactly the same issue that they have in united states because now the world
is very much more similar somehow and also much more related to this exchange of virus for example
we could definitely say that this new introduction of cannabis in our fields
generate a much more aggressive grow of some spices of
enemy for the plant one example is the caterpillar
that never be so present in italian countryside and helicoverpa zea in specific
helicoverpa zea is growing a lot also in places very far from
widespread production and fields and this is something new that is happening this growing
of helicoverpa zea due to the production of cannabis that is something new for our environment
because they take it away our past 50 years or more okay only few region in italy goes on
to grow a cannabis for fiber and in a really really small scale respect how we were 100 years ago
and all these pests and disease as in our in other countries are growing back because
also the reintroduction of cannabis in an environment where we take it away
it's something that disturb the general population of insects for example so as in our other countries
as in the united states as in canada or in france or in east europe where there is a huge
production of cannabis hemp sorry we are dealing with these new pests that are not new but their
massive presence in in our countryside is due to the production of hemp and the reintroduction of
hemp so we could say that somehow from an environmental point of view ecological point
of view we must be very careful about what we are doing especially with these modern
possibility to share seeds or plant wherever in the planet because it's very important to understand
what we are going to do to our ecosystem because also in doing something good as replanting hemp
we could make a mess this is something that has already happened here in italy but also in other
countries that wrong agronomical practice allowed these pests and diseases to grow much more
and to be spread around everywhere and it's something critic
i saw all these new virus for hemp and cannabis coming from united states that are already here
in italy and in europe and i'm trying to talk with farmers and to and to home growers to every
person that are involved in this situation in order to prevent this widespread of disease
that is something that is due to an inappropriate way to carry this reintroduction of species
and especially with this possibility to send a clone in united states in 24 hour by plane
because we must be very very very careful because the ecosystem is very fragile you know it's very
italy is interesting too like like we mentioned that slow food movement that change of culture
like people talk about regenerative agriculture on our channel a lot it's a lot about the culture
of what we do and it's a big passion of the cannabis community in north america that being
said regenerative practices and a lot of these slow methods are part of how you farm like absolutely
why would you put shit all over your field to like fuck it up like it doesn't make sense to
any of these farmers so like even you go there and the food is like brighter and it's just like
your regular grocery store stuff even it's it's like so much better it's it's a different world
altogether for culinary like as a chef a culinary and a passionate culinary person in a region that
is very involved with food i see a lot of potential for cannabis and hemp as um as a
avenue for a lot of new and interesting spices and flavors and additions that we can add into
to the food like we we know like just the selection of seeds that you have uh the amazing
variety there is there is there any of that happening yet in italy is that is that dive
into the culinary world happened yeah alluring first about the agronomical point of view
i'm personally involved in organic agriculture from 12 years i have a farm here we produce
mono olive oil and monoculture monoculture and we are very sensible i think
here in italy about this point of making our production sustainable because this is the
unique future that we have and also here help us europe with our regulation about
chemical that we could use in not in organic farming obviously but in general normal farming
where there is a such a reduction of chemical product that we could use
uh that also uh not interested farmers start dealing with organic application and
this point of the original regenerative soil is something that we are work a lot on because as i
told you before we have a really problem a big problem with water in italy and with desertification
think about that a good part of sicily will be the desert in 50 years something like this
so we are dealing with this exactly today i was looking some soil analysis of my of one of my
neighbor because we are seeing some biochemical unbalance or issue in our land that are always
cultivating in using organic techniques because the changing of of the climate the climate changing
is affecting the soil and his capacity to regenerate himself and need our support on this
we are talking today about something that is very interesting in my opinion that is the soil
temperature soil temperature and the amount of rain determinates the microbiological life inside
that brings the equilibrium in in the chemistry of the soil we are talking about
putting more weed in order to have our soil from of olive groves soil much more cold respect
continue cutting the grass and keeping it very clean because we are seeing all this problem
so i think that as a generation of agronomists as a farmer generation of farmers we have to deal
with this point and it is also a big possibility because there are a lot of new technique to try
there is always something interesting to study and to try in our fields and i think that we could
take the good part of this bad situation of climate changing and trying to become specialized
in this and i think that can amp could have a big a really huge capacity to help us in this
in in having better soil using this as a plant that you you just grow it to make biomass and
to make more carbon in your soil and the other point is the co2
um is capacity to absorb co2 much higher than a woods so i think that hemp and all the movement
on knowledge that there is around her it's very interesting because it's a possible solution for
climate changing and is a weapon that we have to preserve our soil and to make it better and to try
to fight against the climate changing the farmers are like a critical part of the culture in italy
whereas is in north american culture it's like you're so distant from them or they're you never
even interact with the farmer in your life like there are people that live regularly and never
like interact with someone that works their land and it's absolutely backwards to me and like we
use their organic and methodologies but when you look at even comparatively it's like you guys
pretty much are what we would consider a certified organic naturally right it's these newer methods
of the green natural farming the regenerative stuff that's kind of introducing those new things
i think the the the the bug situation is interesting when you take a plant that was part of a culture
for so long that was taken away and reintroducing it and these pests coming up in the way that they
do it reminded me a lot of that kind of flow of predator versus prey so like if they're good if
you get these bugs and you're spraying that that prey that predator that would eat that prey
no longer comes around right you're gonna prevent those bugs from being that that homeostasis from
coming back so it's always kind of interesting to see that aspect change and to hear that is
actually you can see it at on the ground there there now did you want to touch a little bit on
the culinary like is it being used culinarily in italy and then after that we'll do a couple
shout outs and i'll let you get on with your day because it's getting a bit late there and you have
only an error hard-working guy what is culinary i don't know what it is uh so cooking so like our
chefs starting to introduce uh yeah into their kitchens as a as a herb yeah yeah it's a herb
right it's i can chop it i could take a leap off chop it fresh and i can put it in something i
enjoy it um is that starting to become there is there is there is a place i think that there are
much more than how i know but there is a place in milan that is a place where come chefs from all
over the world and is like a pioneer place for those kind of things and already three four years
ago they start making this dinner with all things cooked with the use of hemp and his terpenes and
flavonoids in order to make new things is something very it's a kind of cooking very
different respect our traditional it's something more related to the future but i really enjoyed
this capacity to use this product to make something new then there is the traditional use of cameras
uh for example um pasta made with seeds cannabis seeds there is a beautiful production of cannabis
seeds in south of italy for make a very good oil and for make pasta for example
and many other things always related to seeds production we have we are a little bit stuck
on the use of flowers also if people use it also in these places of experimentation we could say
because our law permit the use of flowers but not thc in elements in food and and this is
it's a bit of issue respect the biggest product industrial production but this is not the question
yes definitely there is in some places of experimentation the use of cannabis as
hemp as an ingredient for their production i get as as like i was a chef for 15 years i trained
over in europe but like i said i lived in in sicily for a while and the the food like i go there on
eat literally from like the moment i wake until the moment i go to bed if when i'm whenever i'm
there visiting it's like it's ridiculous i know you know nobody eats like that every single day
when they live there but the food is just it's next level there's nothing and it doesn't even
need to be complicated it's it's got brighter flavors everything is taken with care you know
the point of italian cuisine for my personal opinion is the simplicity is the fact to give
much more value to simple ingredients and get to a very nice level of taste but with a very simple
way of making it so not so many ingredients not so many
um mixed you know we we could definitely say that something that it's interesting on our
food culture is this valorization of simple ingredients and making them at the best
100 like ragu like a proper ragu is tomato wine beef garlic onion yeah
five things you oil for the pan you know but five things that's it and like you like people
like try and throw cinnamon in that shit here like they're throwing cinnamon sticks in and like
and then nice and it's like what the fuck is the matter with you this is
i personally i personally like fusion but
for us is something related to our memory yeah this memory of simple recipe and simple ingredients
that make the difference and make the quality of what you are eating and it's something that
is related to our culture somehow and how we were raised up you know yeah you know that there is
this huge importance of the taste and simple food and the taste during the childhood and you will
remember always this kind of taste and you will find them always as your home during your life
then also the fusion is very interesting but if i love italian cuisine and italian food
is for his simplicity yeah it you know and it's it's that simplicity that makes things really
nice i love that cultural point because that's a big part of the heritage of italy and and the
culture is that that inlaid food i think that's really when you look at north america and and
what's happened with the industrialization of the food movement because all of this comes back
into cannabis and agriculture and everything right so with that industrialization when they took it
and they they made machines produce hundreds of thousands of pounds of salt bait like just nothing
that adds a lot of nutrient in it and then you you create all these pre-packaged products you don't
you you develop a cuisine like i mean sure you have like creole and and and some amazing regions
of cuisine but if you look at canadian north american cuisine in general it hasn't developed
in a way like properly at all that any other cuisine has where you have to utilize what's
around you and that and the utilization of what's around you and the methods that you have to process
it create the systems and the dishes that continue to go so like you're not going to have you know
like bolognese sauce is going to be something that's typically or as common in areas where you
have a really frigid environment you know like you wouldn't develop a recipe with a high volume
of tomatoes in it where you can't find tomatoes very frequently right so i think that's kind of
the culture point that that's missing and it affects the whole system right because we lose
that culture and relationship with food we lose that culture and relationship with the farmer
and then we lose that cultural relationship with the land and then we lose that cultural relationship
with the plant and that is is whether we like it or not is such a part of our souls that i think it
creates a lot of these issues we see with mental health and and other problems in our culture when
it's just as simple as going out letting your kids eat dirt and getting your hands in there and get
some bacteria on you you know yeah it's not only a matter of fulfilling yourself but it's a matter
of giving value of the single ingredients because for a lot of people that work on it i i make oil
olive oil as i told you i have a small farm here close to france border in montana in montaigne
and we make a very good oil i don't say that because it's mine i say that because
it's very good and find his way in the market also if we make not so much but only for the quality
you know and there is a huge difficulty in producing a single thing you know that is so
important for for for for your for your for your cuisine you know so we could definitely say
that for us the the as a culture we have to be back a little bit you know we cannot be so
outside the respect of the world you know this is my personal opinion i i think that
it's necessary also the rest and i like it and the city where there is noise there are many people
doing different things but if i could say that it's important for me is this point to give value
to products because it's not only a matter of resources it's a matter of people it's a matter
of technology and it's very important to understand when we are buying something that was a
hemp seeds or a kilogram of oil or a cheese that is not only food to fulfill yourself but
something that have a history that there is people on the back that is working for this
and mostly of the time there is a huge culture to get to that point i see for olive oil production
how we have changed technology in the last 25 years to have a better product well done that
could work could be used for years without losing his quality and also the possibility to understand
their quality this is very interesting this is very interesting and we saw that the kids are much more
connected to this quality respect the older you know because older have another standard
of taste young people have much young very young people have much more capacity to
understand if something is really good and that is very interesting because it's it's tell us that
somehow growing up we lose our memory we lose our capacity to understand and i'm really a promoter
with organic farming low impact because this is something that our generation must do
for safety for for the planet and for all of us
to be back a little bit this is what i tried to do in my life
give back that's that community part of the italian culture that just doesn't let go it's
trying to give back to the community so i got a funny get back with with with different tools
to be open to the world that it's something creating what you are doing and there is this
and there is this opportunity to share all over the world also if i live on the mountain up in
italy in a in a difficult place to get okay but this new opportunity to be connected
it's something that give us a chance to be known to sell our product to pay our bills of course
but i think that there is something very good in this modern world and we like it
and i like it but there is also something from the past that we have to carry on and
to make it better to use new technology try to understand them because in the new technology
there there is not only always something bad and there is not only something good
we must understand much more on what we do and be focused on what we are doing and study
and try this is the point
amen now my wife is awesome so like we're chatting and like i said my my mom came out
to bed so i've got some like fresh pecorino fresco and some molto i just absolutely love it
but you were talking about the olive and we'll try it we're coming down in two hours i appreciate
your time it's been an amazing conversation i look forward to hopefully having another one with
you later on when you want when you want but like i got an interesting story for the italian for the
olive oil thing because i think a lot a lot of italians have a little bit of a you know maybe
15 to 30 plants if they have a little bit of land they'll put maybe have a few trees up and my family
does they live in um cortona well just south south of cortona are you familiar with cortona in
tuscany does that sound familiar to you at all so they have they have that f1 race up the hill to
cortona the city at the top right yeah and my family has a has a villa it was a little bit of
land there uh fattori uh fattori bisetto i believe um and it used to be a restaurant called the red
rooster but anyways um it's on the way up the hill and it's one of the main like challenging
kind of fun turns for this race that they do once a year but and the italians they love their cars
they love their races they love this type of stuff so they have because it used to be a restaurant
their upper area they have a big parking area that people that people used to use to go to the
restaurant so now every time this happens it's like filth like people will come to watch this
corner turn and every year they always all the italian men they drink in the beer they're watching
the gate they're watching the race and then they run over to our olive field and behind the bush
and take a pee you know and i have this they have they they they took their olive oil a couple years
ago when it was when the olives were ready they've had a couple bad years because of the heat
um but a few years ago and and they took it in and they pressed the oil and the the the the guy
that pressed it he's like oh my god like this is the nicest oil i've pressed this year it is
absolutely tremendous it's like 99.8 pure it's like really really nice and they're like oh it's
got to be the p it's got to be the guy's being on the robbery it's exactly what it's got to be
so that that's the theorem and that that that unless there's a race and the p the olive oil
will not be as good each year you know it's very important i think that you are growing them
in a natural way so you have less production but much more quality so quality over quantity
they don't bring any back for me my mom came to visit she didn't bring any olive oil they
apparently only have enough for themselves every single send me your your address i send you some
oh you know what i i will uh i will take you up on that now although italy is terribly expensive
for shipping i i do not i know but it's only a present it's just a friend you are in the uk
no i'm in canada you're in canada okay you know what i might do though is is next time uh is is
maybe it'd be easier if i could give you her address and then when she comes out or i come
to visit because we go frequently we can connect that way i will i will be happy that we should
definitely do a show on your farm and i will come for a visit yeah why not you know next time yeah
you could come i could show you if it's the proper time in the year i could show you our test fields
our also the olive groves all the production that we have we have our garden and our lemon
our oranges all our things you know my heart is my heart is beating with the orbs you know
it's it's it's quite it's a beautiful place to getting out there as frequently as possible is
is very important to us my my mother my grandfather is italian so we were able to do the
1948 um citizenship so i can technically get my citizenship yeah you could have it you could yeah
so we're about we're about it takes the two years to do it and we started the process at the start
of covid so it got a little bit screwy for a bit there but hopefully we might be in the next year
looking for property which will be you know hopefully a lot of fun and be be a great time
i'll definitely have to reach out to you for some support there too yeah absolutely which would be
a lot of fun but then but before we go let everybody know where they can get a hold of you
a shout out of who you are what you got going on and how they can support you whether it be
north america and stuff i have my website that is boohoo.sativacreation.it
where you could buy our seeds or connect catch up with us on instagram
sativa creation italia or sativa creation and we have two account there and or our email info
at sativa creation point it we are here and we are happy to stay welcome to you and to
let you try our genetics or our olive oil as you want well you know what i'm thinking is is
because like i i was really hinging because i've already applied for this citizenship you know and
i've been debating because the big debate is like can i go to italy and still like this is my house
like these are i'm running these as a phenol hunt i've got breeding project there i've got all these
plants there's sativa land various varieties and there's all these things like i don't mind if i
have to do cbd i don't mind adjusting but i don't want to give up my my my plant my plant time it's
it's part of my soul i need it like it helped me get through some of the toughest parts of my life
when you're feeling completely out of control when nothing seems to be quite going right and you have
something that you can feed and take care of and it grows and it gives you something back out of
that care that's not like hey 15 years for your kid you know like that's like you know in a six
month period of time you get a lot of reward for the for the work i it really helped me through
that period so i think it's highly important so it's gonna like i'm literally gonna go like okay
we're gonna try and get there in the next year now because the idea of being able to open a farm
and go to the farmer's market and sell my farmer's good and have my hemp produce be included in that
is the dream i i 90 percent of the it's the dream it's every single person in this chat
that is their dream i can guarantee it you know think about us we have studied we have built up a
farm and we were waiting this you know to have the possibility to do this and then things are goes
over to decide to make breedings to have results and to have this opportunity to spread those
variety all over the world and so things are going much much more deep inside and we don't
know where we we could get you know but the feeling of working with this plant it's very important
it's a lifestyle i could say it's a culture it's that so many of us might be feel like we're missing
you know it's that piece that we can get into and be part of so thank you for allowing me to share
some space with you i am definitely going to be doing this again i i i think we should try and
like do you italy has actually really fantastic internet just so everybody knows like if you got
shitty internet connection here in canada and the u.s go ahead like it's the autobahn like on the
highway you guys have like 5g internet it's weird like no matter where you are you've got good
internet so my question is do you have do you have connectivity on the farm because i could
i know the timing is a little weird but i'm sure we could schedule something and maybe do a couple
like hey check it out we've just finished planting check this out we're at this stage
now i'm talking from my house in the farm up on the hills but we have a good connection and
we could do this definitely it's all right it's an opportunity that you are giving to us
and i'm very active on this awesome well i look forward to doing that because that's going to be
epically fun and i can't wait to see everything those are some amazing varieties thank you so
much it's 30 it's almost 31 degrees in my in my greenhouse right now and if i don't vent things
things are going to start dying so i have to cut this short again i appreciate it go ahead
you have and we are gonna end it there i hope to to have to
have been able to express myself properly and uh it was really a pleasure for me thank you very much
this is probably one of the best shows i've done in a bit i've gotten more positive feedback in the
chat than usual so i'm just gonna say thank you people absolutely love what you had to say and
it came through very very clearly so you did a wonderful job thanks again and we do the wave
because we got to say goodbye to everybody and i'll do the end thing you got to wave too
