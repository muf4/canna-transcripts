I'm just solving the problem and figuring out why the hell they're here in the
first place. What did I miss? There's got to be something here that they're going
after. It has been hella hot here and they're looking for water about this
time of year. They all try to charge inside you know what I mean? They're like
this is this is where the good stuff is. So today I'll go through and I'll
spray wherever they are with some vinegar water or you know friggin a
little bit of a little bit of alcohol and bleach water or pepper water or
whatever I got you know? So I don't really know what I have. I just got home
and all of a sudden there's ants all over all this shit and I've been
battling them ever since. So I'll whip up some vinegar water or something and I'll
spray like the perimeter and I'll clean everything up really good and we'll see
what the hell's going on. I'll cock any cracks and crevices where they might be
coming through. I'll focus on all those things physical barriers as much as
possible but I'm not gonna go spraying a bunch of like chemicals and stuff around
I don't like doing that you know unless it's an absolute like fuck we have to
nuclear bomb this whole facility thing. But yeah. When they get bad man like I
have I had ants like literally take down Suchoi last year. Like I broke one head
off after it started flowering and I've never seen ants rip apart a plant like
this before in my life. But they just literally tore it down from top to
bottom like bit by bit by day by day was absolutely nuts. I have a nan issue and I
always have to fight them. I've been reading about these you can buy these
colonies of their like zombie ants or something and they like they go around
and they like steal half the colony or like kill the queen and take the colony
away or something like that. I thought that would be kind of fun. That would be
that'd be like the war of the ants. Yeah man you know strong will survive you
know send send warriors to battle them you know for sure. No I always just try
to do the you know flood them out piss them off create un you know unhooked
like bad habitat. You know what I mean. So best way to go I guess. I find the
mine solids ridiculous to help. They are. I can see how they're getting in so we'll
stop that. That's how there is to it you know. Have you guys tried the boric acid
deal where they take it back to the colony and kill everything. Little borax
mixed with sugar. I've used that before it works pretty good. Yeah sometimes like
the funny thing is like sometimes it'll work good and sometimes it won't work
good and ants go through different phases of what they're eating you know
what I mean. So sometimes they'll be able to take that and eat it and it'll work
pretty good piss them off. Other times they're not eating that right now and
you know it doesn't it doesn't help. So if I have it like I said I'm a man of
what is in the back of my truck and what do I have under the sink on hand
right now. I'll come up with something you know sometimes. Starting point.
Boric acid there's you know sometimes it's not you know but I have had mixed
mixed you know mixed effects. I mean like people say diet's tenacious they're
weird stuff but most of the powdered stuff that I put out will get wet pretty
quick and doesn't do much good for me in a lot of cases. So you know it's like
spray it with something that's you know kind of gonna mess up their pheromone
like I hope vinegar would or a bleach would kind of clean up the area and kind
of you know confuse them and piss them off to where they don't want to kind of
crawl through there and seal those seal those fuckers off you know I gotta
figure that out though. That's what I'm doing tonight I guess.
Little pee pellets nice. Little bath. What are you watering with? I thought I'd get
them soaking now like right off the bat because I've got to do I got to do 50
cuts during tonight's episode. Between between that's why I came to come help
out with the camera between these and some other stuff that I've been looking
through I need to get a whole bunch cut so I can start testing testing up stuff
and getting into the flower and you know sex in and doing everything. I really
like to keep the original moms like the original plant as long as possible to
take cuttings off of so I'll take like a really early round and get a test going
and seeing how they go and I find they actually really root pretty pretty
fucking quick like especially on these early kicking strong plants once they
get to about this I bet you were at what like eight weeks maybe I'm not too
sure. London what are you pouring in there that wasn't straight water my
friend? Yeah it was black. I got some humic humic and fulvic in there actually
just straight humic actually in this but fulvic is part of the humic molecules I
guess there would be some fulvic in there as well a little bit of calcium
like CalMag and I put a little bit of rooting hormone in there just to kind of
give them a little boost just to get over that 80 like that 60 to 80 percent
success rate and try and get them into the 90s sometimes it's hit and miss so I
find it like the temperature fluctuates so much here and there it's kind of a
mess but I try and use those and a bunch of labs I like to put a bunch of
fucking labs in there and I find that that that helps you know prevent bad
bacteria from showing up and causing weird mold stuff like that so I like to
I like to put that in there as well. Yeah man I like I like using just
friggin really clean water nothing in it. Nobody saw that but I literally dropped
the microphone off of a three-foot shelf and then caught it midair like a fucking
ninja and I'm telling you man we were on camera but like I wasn't on camera so I
can't even prove this right now but it was the most sly thing I've ever done in
my life. That's great. Those people wouldn't remember the Karate Kid reference.
Danielson. Truly epic. These are beautiful fucking plants Mr. Trees and they are
starting to get really stinky like quite quite quite odorsome and that's still in
the vegetative stage at this point in time. Nice. Yeah I'm just finishing up
man all those the ice cream cake Kandahars are they're finishing up
they're coming on the homestretch man they're they're they're all got they all
got color like ice cream cake type color you know it's a Kandahar red I mean
the fade to reds and purples and greens. Musty beautiful plants man I'm excited
looks like they're gonna hash well you know looks like those heads want to
break off it's getting some real sandy to the touch you know on most of them
that's not a greasy kind of resin it's more of a sandy resin when you touch the
bottoms of the flowers and kind of rub the fingers together so that's cool but
yeah I'm excited you know I want to taste those bad boys and I got the pure
stock going this year for the you know for the full-term season so we're gonna
see the the pure stock in a real full season you know ground situation you
know what I mean which will be really nice so I'm excited about that. Going back to Iowa.
So we didn't catch up from coastal grown OG last week we missed you and and how
are you doing and how are the plants growing do you want to do you want to be
our first in-depth recap on how your plants are doing? Yeah yeah as we missed
you. And I'd like to talk about IMO a little bit in the ant thing and how you
can if if I can actually remember to talk about it at the end about how you can organically. I've smoked a lot of weed so far and I'm
smoking a lot more weed I can tell you what I'm gonna remember and I'm gonna
make sure you tell me about IMO. Well yeah I I've been I had about three more
strokes in the last couple of weeks so I've been kind of just trying to
struggle with that but I've kept up with them and this is where we're at right
now. They're looking pretty large I'm just waiting to get to the point where
I then take some clones off of them and defoliate the bottoms and yeah I mean
they look perfect. Oh yeah they got so big one of the fans decided to start
eating more of the leaves but other than that it's been perfect I mean they look
perfectly green they're very happy they don't feed very heavy they're just happy
with water and I think I've only given them like full humics and just box farm
oil with soilless mix of the cocoa and it it just it just goes I mean it these
plants are so happy I just I'm really out with the way they're turning out.
You got any smells on them in beds? They got any smells coming off them? You rip off
any leaves and get anything funky coming off of them or anything? I'm actually so
paranoid about touching them I'm not even doing the stem row I'm just waiting
because I'm so afraid of contaminating them because I just went through killing
off all of my mothers due to a mite infestation because we let my dog into
the house and it basically contaminated everything completely violated my entire
IMO so yeah I'm not even touching them like I like I could barely even get near
them with a water them this is the closest I've gotten to them in days
because I won't I won't allow that to happen so I'm hyper PTSD'd out by the
spider mites but um on the IPM you were discussing the the issues with the ants
one issue with ants and with a lot of these insects is they cannot stand like
you mentioned diatomaceous earth but also perlite and what I would do is I
used to on like mother plants and high-value plants is run about an inch a
half inch to an inch of perlite on the top of the container just enough to where
when you water it it doesn't water down it still stays up top but what happens
is any thrips that are like living in the ground that want to come up they die
because their exoskeletons get cut any thrips that want to go down die because
their exoskeletons get cut and it's the same thing with ants and other mites and
everything else and I found by just using straight-up perlite on the top
perlite it really worked well the other thing was defoliating mother plants at
least a third of the plant and then painting them white with an acrylic
paint kind of like you see like like cocoa palms and in the Caribbean they
are always painted like that so the insects and the and the iguanas don't
want to walk up them because for some reason they're like this attracted due
to the color I don't know why but it works and I had about a good 10-15 year
streak without any mites before I changed over but that that's to me
probably the best advice I can give for like IPM that's completely organic not
doing anything as far as spraying something if you want to spray
something citronella as long as it's not very flowering but that's about it and
now I'll shut up yeah that the white paint on trees and stuff that you see is
it's actually it's a water-based latex type paint that allows some breath
through there it's not a nasty paint or anything like that and it's for
sunscreen and you'll only see those in places where it's really really hot you
know Palm Springs Arizona Nevada Texas in some places where they'll actually
paint the tree trunks and the bottom halves or they use a lot of times in
avocado culture for when those you know branches are you know soft and soft
wooded and stuff but a lot of people think that it's for insect control and
other things like that it's not not not not the case at all for the white paint
part it's it might make it a little bit you know funnier you know not not as
desirable but it's it's always for the sunscreen factor which is really really
cool so if you ever have a tree or an avocado or a tree that's really really
thin leaves and has been sick and kind of defoliated heavy and has a lot of its
branches exposed and stuff like that you can go to most nurseries or just go
to the Home Depot you can get a water-based latex white paint or a tan
paint and you can paint all the the top sides with the trunk of all those little
exposed branches just to buy you some time until you can get those leaves to
get up and throw some shade over the over the on the canopy over those spark
bars per like that's that's not it yeah that's that's the first this is why I
love this stuff because it's like that's the first time I've heard it I
always heard like from locals and stuff the Caribbean the opposite but you know
it's always great to like hit these ideas off other people and see what
their opinion is on it because you never know really what's going on but I was
like oh it worked for me but I mean maybe it was just you know it was just a
flash in the pan or some sort of like placebo kind of effect so yeah no a lot
of the times you know like that's you can get you can get you know you can get
mixed results and things in that regard but just like the original reason of why
it's like deployed in general and where you'll see it deployed most often is is
because of the sunscreen factor and there might be some places I've heard of
people like mixing stuff into the paint like perithrins and other things like
that where you're actually like putting putting some sort of a killer or a
deterrent or discourager in that pain as well for for insect control but yeah
it's just a cool thing that like you're you're in that foreign world and
you're doing that stuff you're painting those trees for sunscreen you know I
mean you're gonna put some sunscreen on you know that's it's crazy that bark
will peel and crack and they don't heal the same as us and you got up you got a
big problem after that point you know what I mean in certain areas so it's
real it's a real valuable kind of tactic especially on thin thin canopy trees you
know we always do that for the hundreds of sick trees all the time you know like
avocados and mangoes are the two like most common ones that I'll do because
they have a green flexible bark it's not like really woody like other trees they
have you know when they're young bark that's just really this green flexible
stuff that gets burned really easy it's really sensitive and they need to be a
thicker canopy tree so they can you know avoid that sunscreen you know avoid
that sunburn and stuff like that so when they get sick we're always painting those
bad boys and when they're young out in the hills out in Fallbrook's and you
know the you know Riverside and places like that where they're doing a lot of
the grove grows and they're growing them like by the thousand all the youngsters
go through and they get painted they painted and you get all this whitewash
gloss blast all over the leaves because they're just doing with a backpack
and stuff and just spray them down just to keep them keep those young ones from
burning up but that the perlite thing does you know there's some valley you
do that one that definitely does you know harm the harm that soil surface for
those you know those soil dwellers the fungus gnats some of those thrips some
of the other types of mites and things they don't like having that that little
layer there I ran a big bed a couple times with a bunch of perlite on the top
and a couple of pots with a bunch of perlite on top and did some trials and
some tests and stuff and I did have some success you know I mean keeping some
some numbers down but my stuff would get so dry when I would water it would poof up
and that dust would go up into the air all the time because it was a you know
it was just always sitting on the top it always have that perlite dust and as
soon as you hit it with a little bit of water or whatever it would poof up and I
just that was one of the reasons why I stopped doing that but you got a problem
that definitely can help you for sure just like sand and you sand the same way
you know put a layer of sand on the top surface of the soil and smothers things
out keeps keeps those soil guys from being able to travel as well you know up
and down through it but this cool stuff I love farming stuff man it's cool
talking about it's good so a lime wash on the the trunks for protection PJ's
asking Oh what what kind of watch a lime wash like lime I've never I've never used
that I've not I'm not seeing a lot of the lime wash on the trunks that might
you know I don't know that's something I don't know about I can't speak on that
one but I'll definitely look into that you know just just because you know
something that I haven't heard of being used that way so I'll look into that I
think that's that's interesting with the the pain of white and everybody always
assumes that the colors and stuff like that transition or do these extra things
I've wondered like my neighbor sprayed all of his trees and all of his knit all
of my neighbors stuff with this gross smell like like two weeks it just smells
like rank ass I don't know what it is what he's putting down with some sort of
like heavy-duty pesticide on his fig trees and it just absolutely drives me
nuts there's got to be better off when it comes down to it so like my question
is so we're doing we're gonna try and do some cuts and some clones and see where
everything's going there what what kind of results have you been seen in the
flower tent with the plant with it not in your flower tip yeah you think you
have a little bit larger of a space in a flower tent there mr. trees what have
you been seeing kind of as the end results of some of these these plants
and and and how have everything been going what can we look to expect even
with rooting times and stuff like that have you have you cut take a lot of cuts
at these plants and see how they root up or yeah they have a pretty good route
rooting on the SF V's and ice cream cake ones are the only ones that I've taken
cuts off of them taking cuts off the Pam or the Royals or any of those at all yet
but the ones I took kept cuts off of her you know average time somewhere like 8
to 8 to 10 8 to 10 8 to 11 days before roots start popping out of there no
like like you know like coastal was saying they're not a not a huge amount
of food has been needed not a huge amount of water they're one of the last
ones to get pissed at me I'll let them get a little pissed at me sometimes you
know what I mean and they'll be a little bit thirsty sometimes you know push it a
little bit and they're there one definitely both both sides like the SF
V side and then the ice cream cake side they're a little bit a little bit more
forgiving on that for me which I have noticed the there's no like the biggest
thing I've been looking looking at is different smell you know features and
stuff I'm seeing how much if any sweetness is in there I haven't found
any anything that's been sweet yet it's all been like real real dark notes maybe
some spicy notes here and there you know kind of splashed in there but real
funky dark musty body odory spicy kind of there's almost some cinnamon or
something and in a couple of those ice cream cakes that I've smelled but mostly
dark notes and then like bug pressure like the the biggest issues that I have
ever is is thrips it's one of those things that I'm you know I have if I let
my guard down thrips will come back real quick you know what I mean they're
they're they're easy and they're not bothering they're gonna kill my plants
but they make they make pictures look ugly and you know plants aren't the
happiest when they're when they're getting their butts kicked so I try to
just stay on the thrip issue there but some of the ones that I just I flowered
up and like I said before is off I'll throw things in flower and I'll get them
going to where they got two weeks left to go and then I'll throw them outside
and they get to see the Sun they get to sleep under the moon this time of year
the light cycles close enough to where they were at it's not gonna freak them
out too much and then kind of finish out their their days there weather's
perfect for them out there so some of them because of where we are like some
of the other things that I've thrown out there not the candy heart stuff thrips
have popped up pretty quick and picked on some of them older clones you know a
couple of like the you know the Mac clone the royal clone couple of things
on the third it's like a whole time say that I have I I've been having some
thrip problems lately and I'm loving this this point of conversation you know
what I mean Rove beetles has been one of my things that every couple years I'll
order a batch of you know a real big batch of Rove beetles and I'll read I
didn't really the space I did that aureus I released some aureus some some
fire bugs fire but no no I've only ever done you know a few I I don't do any of
the predatory mites or any of those things like that the only thing that I've
ever done like regularly that I that I feel like I believe in you know is the
Rove beetle and you know they hang out in the soil there they take care of a
lot of different things in the soil zone I don't want a lot of mites and other
things and you know I just I don't do ladybugs usually I don't do anything
anything like that it's it's Rove beetles in the soil and then I'm
spraying like you know different oils there's sulfurs there's soaps I kind of
rotate through you know a few different things throughout the the months to just
keep everybody on their toes and you know keep everything on a regular good
IPM schedule and everything you know everything stays happy and good but if
you let your guard down the thrips will tell you here and that's the thing
that's what I mean so the older ones when I threw him out there boom it was
like drifts Ron the other ones they didn't get they didn't get it picked on
as bad you know what I mean which is nice they you know there's there's there's
like three of them or so that I can't see any damage at all they look perfect
you know they're still still hanging in there and they're right in the mix mix
out there anyway so they're tough you can kind of tell that there's some
durability in there there's musty tones in there funky darker tones in there a
good resin sandy content I noticed the sandiness like I was saying before you
kind of touch them you get a little bit more sand on the on the rub on the
fingertips but nothing like like extremely different or noticeable in
like clone time or flower time or anything like that they're all kind of
been like you know right in line with that with the average stuff there but
like are we talking like longer than then then then 63 days or shorter than
63 days or like right around 63 days yeah right around there you know I'd say
like probably 63 to 70 right around in there so anywhere to kind of pick your
pick your rightness don't want your liking you know what I'm saying somewhere
in that realm right there maybe even a little bit faster maybe 61 I'd say 61 to
68 right around there so somewhere in there I haven't gone to all the way to
70 or anything but I don't do a lot of counting exactly so it could be a day or
two off here there so but I wouldn't say yeah no 80 days or anything like
that kind of writing right in the wheelhouse you know look at this
beautiful even branching man like look at it's like perfect okay what seat is
that Layton or Layton sorry London yeah really nice gorgeous this is one of the
longer leaf phenotypes and it's got it's got that spice that you were
mentioning before it's got but with a little bit spice you know what I mean
like it's very nice it's not the most stinky of stinkiest it's at about eight
weeks and I'm starting to see what very early pre flower showing up it's still
way too early a bit too early to tell but I might have a boy here but it's not
gonna make a definitive decision at this point in time we'll check it later on
and if I find a book that's that's that's perfectly good with me too
heck yeah no it looks nice is that the taller ones are they how taller
size or they there any differences in height sorry did you say is there much
differences in the height yeah yeah yeah you know if I think you can see
him can you bring that one over here so you can see him the the two behind it
are actually on a about 12 inches lower because they're not on a block so
they're they're actually very consistent in height they've all been topped twice
I found like I just I like to give them the second top in it I find that it
really like after that first node reappears I find it really helps push
those lower nodes out so that you can get a few more cuttings a little bit
earlier you know you get those get get some a little bit more viability out of
them by that double hard top on the top bar but they've been really consistent
like look at this size of the leaf on this yeah it looks good it looks good
happy you know yeah good shape on it thick stock you're too high you gotta
bring her down a little bit lower there you go yeah it's nice definitely nice
I'm pretty happy with the with the branching on this plant too I think it's
really nice it's got like a it's not like this is definitely not the
stinkiest of the plants I'll tell you what there's other ones that have a lot
more kick to it but it's so long these things can change you know a lot later
on I find that that sometimes you go into flower and it's actually the
complete opposite of what was you were expecting to happen it's just like okay
well that's that's fucked up but usually I find this stinkier plants do it but
most of them are very very stinky how many how many cuts you gonna think you
can be able to get off of those that one right there I'll probably get eight to
ten each somewhere in there it's hard to say exactly some of them will probably
get a couple more hmm yeah yeah hack them down to pretty much the top double
double hard thing I like I love it when you have it's stupid I know some people
probably hate it but I love it when you have that kind of shape of plant when
it's like it's like got the microphone stand on the base and then you have that
you see that mean high high ratcheting so I love it when mothers is it when
you're working a mom and you're trying to maintain it all the time I fucking my
back I have a terrible fucking back and if it can be a little bit more tall and
like just focus there even if I lose like a month or two I've taken clones I
only run a max at a time so when I'm doing mix hunt runs it's not a big issue
to throw in like two two two two and two cuttings of each and so I have plenty
left over so it's not really a big concern but I find that it's a pretty
good route around that way I don't have to bend over so far so I wanted to show
you my plants I'm gonna go grab a couple out of the dock tent see what they look
like because I wanted to show you the contrast in the difference between them
you know but give me two seconds awesome what what's everybody's smoking on while
we have a moment wait for Cory to get back here what do you smoke on coastal
coastal grown unfortunately it's runt I didn't grow it it's someone else's stuff
I went through I harvested about a half pound and went through it in a month
like a month ago so I have to like yeah rely on someone else's shit but I hate
GSC anything and yeah I'm just smoking some runs today I'm smoking some uh what
is this this is some dog walker so yeah that's mostly dog walker I think there's
some Pam F3 nugs that they're in this jar in here somewhere I grabbed a couple
job grab the dog walker jar and grab a couple extra nugs and threw a couple
things in there and you know good you know mostly dog walker and since I don't
smoke I'm only popping you know some sour diesel edibles so
Chad you guys smoking sorry save it for the 420 I have been enjoying some not
seeded weed because I've been smoking seeded weed for two weeks now you know
like you get over comedy you're like you have like a bunch of great runs you know
you're really killing it you're always up four jars every run that you do things
are going right but you see you're definitely consuming a lot like me and
my wife consume like a full packed full mason liter jar like a week like we go
we go through a lot we go through a fair bit we thank you thank you we take pride
we dig a lot of pride but anyways when the consumption is just a little bit
higher than what your original plan would be and then you have a run where
you run for seed and then run before that doesn't go so well and then it's
like oh shit now I'm gonna start saving my roaches on my last jar so it's nice
that I've got some stuff that just came down some lemon cush headband you know
threes that I love love love and it's it's I think it's gonna be the best
round of it I've grown so far so I'm very excited about that this is looking
beautiful Corey tell me what's up okay so they're pretty droopy because they've
been in a dark tent but this is a Kandahar by SFB and topped once and it
looks great in my opinion here's another one topped once huh
way different leaves on it and I think I'm seeing that and this leave looks
bizarre to me I don't out of all the leaves they all look really good this
one's kind of got a weird claw to it I don't know if it's you know what I mean
the lower ones not sure what that's all about but yeah I mean these leaves are
these are really pretty like longer thinner he's a much thicker they're even
like thicker to touch you know what I mean they're more of a leathery leave
yeah it's a really yeah it's a really nice plant really and so I've got two
that are tall like that and I've got three that are more similar to the short
guy here so I don't you know I don't know if you know this might be male
female or you know who knows at this point but yeah they're kind of kind of
different you know yeah I like it I like how they I like how they're showing
differences and then I've got just to just to show you I've got this was the
one of the Royals all right on and kind of same it right in between the two
really you know it's got the bigger leave bigger than you know say that one
but not quite as thick as that that leave structure like it reminds me of
like the first time I tried to draw a weed leaf and I felt like I overextended
the two middle side you know what I mean like it's really like that perfect
consistency of like a nicely drawn leaf like that that's really it's a really
nice it just did great plants I mean every single one of them is fantastic
I'm super excited about them and you know I had I had a little bit of a
slowdown at the beginning like I said I you know my room conditions weren't
great and la la la la but no I mean they rebounded and yeah absolutely like
I'm looking back at all yeah that's right so I don't know let's take a sniff
I'll go yeah I'm listening to you but I'm gonna try to get a smell that SFV
is really tall and branchy and lanky like that one there and then you know
that those candahars like its parents looked a lot more like that shorty right
there okay okay that's interesting you got an inch you got you got an even
spread I got a lot more tall ones yeah I can give me one second I'll go get the
other couple and I'll show you what I mean hang on Corey what kind of temp oh
wait for him to come back but I was gonna ask him what I can hear I got you
a lot lower probably than him I was kissing I was kissing 11 for a few days
for a little while there at night and I was had a couple days where I ran an
average 18 so it's caused I think a little bit more stretchiness in my plant
I think in that mean mean all right so you guys hear me yeah yeah okay all
right so I mean move these guys out of the way yeah and like I say this still
they're acting a little droopy because they're supposed to be sleeping but so
again this one's not super tall in comparison to this one height wise but
again I wish I could better lighting yeah the lenience you know you've got
one that's got these type of leaves and then one's similar to this but just
beautiful beautiful plants you know I mean one top that plants gorgeous you
know I can't be in his here's the other royal you know I can't be happier with
these plants big gorgeous and I'm not quite ready to make clones on mine yet
just my style you know I'm probably another week or two out but you know I
I think I'm probably gonna just clone for sex and then you know call and
repot and go from there it's probably what my plans gonna be but yeah no I
mean I'm super excited these plants are out of control out of control and I'm so
excited about the variation and I'm hoping that we're not looking at male
female and I got me you know a couple of females of each variation you know yeah
yeah you definitely it wouldn't be male if you must split up like that so you
you'll get some females of those tallies for sure yeah that's gonna be cool yeah
I'm excited so I wanted to say something about a
pori's plants I am seeing the exact same damn thing with mine I I think I can
probably get it in here you can see that same kind of leaf malformation
right here where we it's it's it's it's got that deformation with it and then
I'm also seeing differences in terms of the rest of the the growth patterns in
terms of the height some of them are really really fast and they want to have
really nice large flush big leave and there are some that look like they are
stunted for life there is one that literally has a train wreck size if you
ever run like Arcata train wreck it's got the tiniest little like they look
like indica leaves but they're tiny and that's the closest I could say to what
it looks like is that and then there are some that just I don't know they
just they're just kind of going off but I'm throwing them somewhere else so I
can't put them on the camera right now I have to go walk down the street but um
it's it's crazy how how how different all these fetus are showing up and not
to cut you off I have to ask you a question before I forget are you
noticing that the tall ones are consuming more water yes me too okay
good mr. tree yeah you get that yeah the I guess the ones that look like the SF
bees on my end and his tube both us consuming more water yeah for sure and a
little bit more nutrient just a bit I had a hard time when I scorched them
coming back but now that I've got it under control they're kind of yeah
they're all you know staying staying together but yes I think if I were to
turn heavy lighting on them that they'd be quick to quick to bleach yeah
sometimes it's like that if you want to overdrive the lighting and then it just
it just pushes them too hard it's kind of like forcing someone to run for too
long I I've tried to do that sometimes and it yeah like it'll just kill them
I'm surprised at how little lighting I'm using right here is actually keeping
them happy but if a 30 watt LED is actually working I'm just gonna do it
for now until I put them under an 8 yes and then go from there but my I have no
idea how these things are so these are these are some really really really
nice vegetation goes they are very nice I don't know how the hell they fucking
are just so strong and resilient but they really are a great problem to work
would you consider that hybrid vigor I mean is that is that what you would
consider that mr. trees well like hybrid vigor would be like all plants
are extra vigorous you know in all kind of cases so they're they're growing at
rapid pace and structurally sound and healthful and you know just kind of
ripping and kicking fucking ass you know what I mean
putting along stuff like that or you know slow clone times somebody's
you know for for a hybrid hybrid bigger but some of those lines like the the
royal the the Pam are all like pretty solid like the royal was bred for
multi-generations to be what it was by Mandelbrot I think it's his exact plant
you know what I mean so that crossed to that p1 that generational plan over
there that's that's that's as close to a true f1 as you're gonna get you know so
those should be pretty darn vigorous and nice plants healthful strong not not
picked on by bugs all that goes into like hybrid bigger you know kind of in
my in my book you know I'm not growing as many of the the Royals this year as
I'd like so I'm relying on you and a couple other people around town to to
grow those Royals I wish I had more than two I got my fingers crossed yeah I'm
excited to see what what's pulled outside this year you know how that
really works cuz that's really where you're gonna see stuff like that where
it's like wow you know what I mean this thing is you know open up your eyes a
little bit so what are you doing over there London how are you coming along
you said you were doing like 50 clones today yeah I got to do 50 whether I get
them done during the show or throughout the evening I will get them done
regardless the work has to be done otherwise it doesn't happen you know
how it is oh yeah do you I've been saying that for the last few days and I
haven't gotten off my ass do the same thing does anybody like miss down there
their plants their their mother plants like miss down the area like with a
square bottle or anything before you take clones or anything before you take
them yeah yeah yeah that's one of that's one of my little my little
animals one of my little tricks you know what I mean just plain water yeah just
some clean you know clean you know whatever what's the theory water sources
huh what's the theory um you're you're gonna so if it's a more
humid environment if you're cutting things so like in commercial greenhouses
and stuff like that like there they keep the the greenhouses really really
friggin humid you know I mean and doing propagation and stuff and it's more
humid environment you have more success less stress on the plant so I try to
create more of a humid environment and actually get those those plants sprayed
down on the cells they can have something to kind of drink right away
you know what I mean before I snip them cuz I'm setting them up ahead of time
yeah so I'm got you I'm ahead of time and then before they go in they get
there you know the domes and all that stuff get taken care of and all that but
just overall all the mother stock and all that stuff anybody who's getting
kind of cloned or cut on I'll always give them a little bath a little
misting beforehand and you know it really does there is there's some
there's some science behind that so you know give that give that a shot see if
it works I'll take whatever edge I can get for sure
yeah I have to agree with that I do all my clones and I've never bothered to
spritz with water but that sounds like a really good idea to do that yeah sure
for sure and you can look into like different propagation techniques and
like you know how how the big you know like industry does it in in different
crops and stuff like that it's really kind of cool you can steal all kinds of
funny little things you can kind of bring home and you know apply it to the
life you know but that's one of those things that you know I've been doing
that for years and you know I I swear your clone should look good you know you
shouldn't be throwing out clones or you should be having to give them away cuz
it looks so good you know what I mean it shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't cannibalize
but my two big tricks is miss the plants before you take the cuts and then put
your clones in lower light so like whatever you you don't want to put them
directly under a light you know even if it's a less powerful light or a really
small light you know you got I even set them off into the corner and and just a
real indirect lower bright light just to keep them you know you don't want
them to grow you wanted to root and do their thing so lower light they
cannibalize less and then by misting them you have better success of them not
going in shock and and they'll root better you know so those two things are
are big for me on taking clones okay I got a hop in for a second go ahead
go for you go for it first what are you saying is a hundred percent correct to
simplify it for everyone the plants need to not grow so fast so when they're
basically trying to root you don't want them to photos like go through photos
synthesis so quickly that they're eating up all the nutrients every and all the
sugars that are the residual sugars in in that cutting otherwise they will
die off the yellow really fat and so what he's saying is completely true but
that's the simple way of putting and I just wanted to like point that out yeah
because that's right I agree with that I screwed up a ton of clones by putting
them under way too much light for and it this is just a game of learning like by
messing up I just want to throw that in there if I could say to like you'd be
surprised at how many people coach and teach and or or you read in books about
like you need 24 hours the lights on clones and you need a light on it and
you need a separate setup for it and you need all this crap for it I can't tell
you how many times I've heard from like big facilities being like oh why do I
keep getting yellowing on my clones and it's just like well your plant is like
apart from aeroponic facilities your plants fucking photos is using its
energy up to grow and it's not taking in any nutrients so I have to do something
with it and I've been like I I went through this phase where I was like
being hyper taking care of my plants when it came into cloning and then I
started like giving less of a shit I don't I don't mean to say that in like a
way like I actually give less of a shit but more like I like I got to the point
of like you know who cares if you fail who cares and every single time it got
better and and it was that relaxed moment it was that stopping stressing
about them them coming through and having the success to let them be in a
little bit like I just use a window that doesn't have direct sunlight ever you
know what I mean like there's never a direct sunlight it's right by a window
it's just off the drives of my kitchen window my wife fucking drives her nuts
but it works and that's where they go and you know I do well and and they turn
out pretty fucking good you'll see one flop and then you get rid of that but I
like that using looking at large industry and looking at other industries
and how can I utilize their tools and their methodologies like to better suit
myself because no I mean fucking corporate people suck but they don't
but not everything they do is sucky you know what I mean like there's some good
ideas come out of some some really dick people I've met a lot of really amazing
chefs that are just terrible human beings and that's my point of reference
for it so I find that there's like a really keen level to like you know
whether or not you should listen to somebody but I think you should listen
everybody and just try and steal whatever you can out of if it's useful
information use it that being said I brought that point up because I'm
actually using something kind of similar but I've adapted it to be a little bit
more our methodology and more regenerative right so I start with a
wash of really basic just soap really basic dish soap and and hydrogen
peroxide to dip a water and then labs and like a heavy heavy heavy heavy
dose of labs with a little bit of fulvic acid and that's it and throw them in a
pot and let them go and I find that that even if I have a bug issue even if I
have an old issue even if I have some sort of problem going on a cleans them be
it leaves him with a healthy bacterial biome that will allow them to out
populate or or at least challenge whatever might come are come come come
this way with my no fuck approach if I know give a shit about but yeah London
done I gotta keep cutting clones this is fucking exhausting why did I commit to
doing this fucking brutal because you're Canadian you like to help and now you're
in trouble for doing it so what are you guys use like London's using peat pucks
I heard somebody somebody mentioned air cloning or water cloning I do it all I
do it all all the way down to throwing some in a jar sometimes on the windowsill
I do whatever whatever I you know if I'm I'm cleaning up a plant I have something
that looks decent that I want to keep I'll I'll throw it in some dirt I'll
throw it you know but mostly arrow clone if I'm doing a like a batch like if I'm
gonna sit down and do a whole bunch of clones I'm gonna try to probably arrow
clone but you know I'll use anything it doesn't really matter to me that doesn't
mean I have success 100% or you know so it dirt's probably my least successful
but it's my go-to if I'm in a hurry or you know a quick jar throw something in
a jar of water or something whatever to get around to it later but yeah arrow
clone for big projects so how about you there coastal I can clone and anything I
if I'm doing like I agree with Corey as far as like for commercial operation I
want you to clone in and two of them belong to your wife I'll give you a
whole list of different things so the typical water like DWC like little mini
dip DWC cloning I think that is probably the optimal one to use especially because
you can then take those clones use them in soil soilless or in a hydromedia but I
think Cocoa core totally fine soil totally fine I think the the key is to
keep the containers as small as possible and pre saturate the media and make sure
that it has a certain humidity cap on the clone and I think that's it but like
Cocoa core I've even done stuff in straight perlite I've done stuff straight
hydroton you can do stuff in straight sand it you can do I cleanse and darn
air anything it's it's really really easy it really does go back to that just
not trying I think you just keep it as simple as possible and as long as you
adhere to the ideas principles of like keeping that like the hydration level
for the plant you know where it needs to be so it doesn't let go then you're fine
and that sometimes comes down to like making sure that the leaves are maybe
cut down a little bit so that there aren't as many somata letting go of as
much water or it could just making sure there's a dome or just making sure
spring but that's about how I look at propagation mr. trees how are you
working on that I'm a man I've been doing this a long time I clone everything
million different ways so like I've bounced back and forth over the years to
like every different method you can you know think of under the Sun from water
corners to domes to like root rag cubes rock wool to soil I mean there's the list
goes on and on and on but these days I rarely have a plant die I can pretty
much take clones off of most plants and get get them to get them to go and get
them always to go the way that I if it's an important plant something that I I
want to take seriously and make sure I'm taking cuts of stuff they can make it
sure that I have my good library taking care of all those things Oh most nine
times out of ten I'll get get a bag of root rag cubes and I use some root rag
cubes and clean water bottled water our Oh water clean water and that's it
at all yeah sometimes I'll use like a you know a clone X if it's if it's you
know there sometimes I'll use a rooting powder sometimes I'll use a dip and grow
which is a natural acidic acid it's like you know it's just like old-school
nursery stuff sometimes I'll use nothing about 5050 I'll use I like to make clones
like half half of like if I'm making ten clones or something I'll make five of
them with a with a rooting hormone if I got it and I'll make five of them
without and you know if I can get nice good ones without then I'll use those
ones for certain things I'll use the other ones for other things you know what
I mean it's not it doesn't really matter I really don't care I just try to use
less of it it's not like a healthful thing or anything like that it's just
like I would rather just not have to use any rooting hormone if I don't have to
so if I can look at some plants and root them without it not get them used to it
not have to need it then I don't want to use it but you always gotta ask your
clones or plants right from the outset what was that plant thought you're
making the plant stronger right from the outset by not giving it the additions
and if it survives it's a strong plant go for it if it doesn't you're rid of it
right yeah and that I mean that goes to show and then you know that's why you
want to do some with rooting hormone because maybe that plant fucking is just
has a shitty root system but throws the fire so if you got a backup plan it's on
mr. backup plans right so I always like to have lots of things in different
forms so that I know that I have my ass covered you know but I'm doing it I'm
throwing them in root rat cubes clean water in a dome in low light so I have
racks where I do my clones it's just you know a rack with different shelves
on the top is there's a light it's not a powerful light it's like LED light
configing you know Home Depot or whatever I don't even know how many
watts it is but it's a low LED friggin light and it's up top high and I can
throw racks under here kind of staggered so that they can all catch a little bit
of that light and the lower I go the darker it gets but all of them root and
the lower the ones the lower on the shelf they are usually the better the
clones they are always compared to the ones that are at the very top you know
what I mean they're just a weird thing but they're always pretty good and I
always say your clone should look good so they should look you know like good
healthy plants when they're done you got roots sticking on they should look nice
and standing I don't I don't like the well I shouldn't say I don't like I I
think that you should use the type of cloning method for you to like match the
type of growing style that you're in so if you're in like an aquaponics system
or hydroponic system something like that like the the arrow cloners a great
company a great cloner to use because you're already forming those those water
roots if you are going to be growing in soil or you know more traditional and
things like that I think that doing them in cubes or like soil or something like
that is the best way to go because they're gonna grow those proper heroic
soil type roots and if you grow them and if you do clones in a water cloner and
you go to transplant them into soil you always have that that pissed off day or
two right where the plants just piss for a day and I don't like that I like
to plant my clones and make sure that they're still fucking praying from from
moment one to moment one right I don't like any of that stuff and I find that
if I just do it with you know with that in mind they I have no stress when I'm
transplanting anything out sometimes in that clone dome if I've sprung for extra
money or I've got like you know project or it's in the back of my truck I'll
throw a little bit of perlite in my tray so I'll get perlite in my in my clone
tray I'll put a little layer of perlite or vermiculite whatever I have in the
bottom of the tray just like a little quarter-inch and then I'll set my little
my little clone cube holder thing on top of that and I'll put all my my cubes on
top of that so when the roots grow through the cubes if I was gone or I
didn't check them or whatever they'll grow into that perlite or into that
vermiculite and they don't get pissed off or have any issues you can have you
know that's just something that I'll do if I'm really you know if I'm riding
high in the back of my trucks full of stuff you know what I mean but you don't
need you don't need any of that so but I do I always do a dome I don't do any of
the water roots anymore and I try to keep it as goddamn simple as I can I
don't like to you know overthink it but clean water whenever I added a bunch of
shit or like made teas or use fucking aloe or did all these friggin things to
my plants like I always got funky things happening you know and I wouldn't get as
good results and some of those stems would rot and just wouldn't just
wouldn't be you know what it is today you know what I mean so I keep it really
clean I use clean water and it's yeah it's normally pretty bang on you know
can always give away a clone or two that I don't need you know just nice yeah
it's always nice to have extra that you can give away to your buddies yeah
totally totally yeah my old man he always is like taking down his tent
putting back up his tent and he's like I need a clone or two you know it's like I
always like giving him a clone or two this and that you know it's like yeah
he's he wants to he wants to be regular but he just can't he can't stay regular
to do it you know and it always ends up hurting him so I'm almost all right on
right on yeah I know I I actually built my own air cloner 15 minutes on 15
minutes off a 35 gallon tote and I do 23 at a time and I've generally a hundred
percent perfection I put in like about eight gallons of water my pumps in there
it never heats up the water so much that I'm cooking my roots and I'm like
London I put labs in with the water make sure I'm killing any bad bacteria and I
have wonderful clones coming out there you go that's a beautiful thing man
about gardening you know like my old man always says you know the best tool in
the toolbox is the one that works for you but you know how to use you know what
I mean like it's like it could be different from everybody you know it's
just you know that's the coolest thing about plants too we can all get to that
place you know well yeah exactly like I used the five gallon bucket I learned
about it cloning the air cloning from doing tomato plants nothing to do with
cannabis and they're just made a five gallon bucket cloner with like three
holes and they're golden nope nope yeah tomatoes are cool you run in a really
high humidity those things will start spitting roots all up along the all up
along the main stems you know I mean you'll start getting all these little
root nodules start coming off they're in real high humidity you can you know you
make cannabis was that way right you know yeah so how are you doing over
there in London you getting close to your 50 there buddy
yeah I'm about halfway I wanted to end we're halfway through the episode usual
one minute one to two hour on I wanted to say I feel like fucking mr. trees
rock walks through like his yard and instead of like patches where people
usually leave bare grass because they're heavy asses dig it up with
their shitty boots leaves patches of grass you know it's just like oh yeah
just take that clone and throw it over here and it just turned into a whole
plant it was like I gave my dad like for his birthday a little weed bar I like
good like got like five of my favorite ones that I have grown out like I had
some awesome stuff at the time and I like set it up and they've got a bunch
of cuttings and put them in in the room with him like as a decoration for the
table like like in a little vase just whatever right fucking lo and behold I
go up there and it's it's a garage with zero lights like not even like Sun
doesn't even go through the windows like the best thing they have is a TV set in
there and I go in there like a month later and the fucking things got like
huge roots like it's rooted it's grown it's like I had a tray of the exact same
plant downstairs dead cuz it got hit by the Sun one fucking day it was like how
does this like it was it was heartbreaking it was really it was very
frustrating it's like fuck you and it's like and then and then you see me pouring
all this black goo into my tray and mr. trees like no you use plain water don't
fucking put shit in there no you're doing all wrong as typical as typical
but I wanted like I think it's really interesting because everybody kind of
finds their way and their methodology and what it is and it always goes in
this weird path is it goes like oh let's over complicate things let's simplify
things to like a moderate extreme where it's just like okay I'll use cloning
Dale nobody who because it you know like up this little thing that works and then
it's like a three years later it's like well I just use water down you know I
don't even I don't even bother you know like it you know I tried anyone like
fuck that water and it's just like I love that progression and how that
tastes it goes and I think I think it it almost needs to happen right like you
need to develop the methodology and the mistakes and those things and when
you're new and you're managing temperatures and you're trying to find
the right spot to go a little bit of hormone gel might be a little bit
helpful you know in the long run when it comes down to it it might not be
necessary but it could be helpful and then you get these people that like they
put a plant down in four days and it's like they have a fucking like four foot
root system it's like fuck you like fuck you sorry nothing in life comes easy to
me I always have to work really hard for some fucking reason I'm gonna go back to
cloning my plants like a jackass yeah there's all kinds of little things like
when I'm cutting clones and stuff that I'll throw away pieces of clones that
they're perfectly good but because they sat out too long or if I'm cutting
certain stems and they got a little bit of hollowness to the stem I don't like
air getting up there so you know that's one of the reasons why I missed them
really good beforehand to try to make sure that there's there's human as
possible but if I cut them and I let them sit on the table or whatever and I
get air up in in the in the in the stem that's gonna lower my percentage a
little bit in my mind so I'll cut them try to throw them directly into some
water if I'm gonna travel around and cut a bunch of them or keep them as
moist as I can it's not the end of the world and you know you just you just
lower little percents you know as you go along you know you make certain cuts you
I don't spray them down that lowers my percentage just a little bit you know I
do that lowers it just another 1% or whatever and those little things kind of
just stack up and add up over time and man I just you have to go through like
you're saying you have to go through all those little progressions and Albert I
one of my favorite sayings there I always say that my boy Albert Einstein
used to say is like the source of true knowledge is experience right you have
to you have to like it's the only way you know you have to you have to
experience it cannot be told cannot read the book you you have to see it and feel
it to know it you know you have to do it get burned yeah I lost it oh wait
wait wait no I got it so I'm on I'm doing number three right now and that
was the fattest sausages leaf of the of the plant and if you can can you grab
the camera for me there I'm gonna up the up the height let me know when I've got
the good angle I think it's right there but this was the fat super chubby leaf
one that in comparison like I can even pull one off for one of you where's the
where's it where's the extreme opposite there you go not extreme opposite but
not that opposite but you can see kind of that fatness like that's got some
separation in see that that's like you can see that right there really nicely
and it's just like this fat overlaid thick chunky leaf I wish my lighting was
a little bit better but like it's quite a bit yeah it's still it's still similar
height very similar height you know they get a lot of light because it got South
facing here and I have LEDs on top of them so they get a lot of light one
thing that I didn't notice on the previous plant that I wanted to point
out a little bit ago was this and I don't see this I see it once in a while
I don't see it really really really really really often but I do see it
sometimes and if you can see kind of I don't know if you can see it super well
maybe I can bring a little bit closer and if you can see right there see the
so I did the double top right and then I did the double top but when it once I
did that secondary top this shoot kind of came out as an extracurricular one
and I've seen that kind of bunching happen before but it's not very super
common so do you see a lot of a little bit of that mutation here in there or is
that is that very common at all or I don't know I'm also like like I massage
my plants and look at them all day long like you guys like oh it's the labs once
but I'm like I'm gonna spray labs on you every day give you a light coating of
love fuck I have seen that over the years I mean I've seen that a couple
different times you know with you know with cannabis with other things other
than cannabis funny things like that but I haven't seen it in any of these lines
and I the ones that I ran most of them you saw that that ICC that was showing
the other day I mean I was straight up I didn't top that at all so I didn't give
it the opportunity to do any of that funny stuff to me but also like a lot of
cookie genetics you know have those funky little mutations in there you know
and and weird branching coming out from different places and I've seen them a
lot of different cuts with similar you know lineage in there that that do that
more more often than others I've seen that more often with that lineage than
others so I don't know what's it's interesting to see what that what what
that you know if it Peters out or if it rolls through or what happens with it
you know but I didn't see any I didn't give him a chance to do that for the
most part I had an odd one with a webbed node it looks like not not any of these
plants but it looked like with it but you know with right with it be was
there's a web almost like a leaf look like spanning the two weird I'm kind of
lost with you guys because I've only ever grown the sour diesel so I don't
know much about any other plant than the sour diesel and it could have been
something that I did wrong
all the time and just learn one thing it's really it's it's badass to be able
to do that I grow this and I know it like a mole you know like there's not
yeah you know that's cool yeah you know the smell you know how she looks you
know you walk in the room and you can see there's something wrong with that
plant because it doesn't look right but you gotta have grow year after cycle
after cycle after cycle to get that way what when we do the tastings can I'll
have to like figure out which cut you would probably like the most and because
you're just around me so I'll just like send you the cut that way you could try
these ones out as well I've always got a variety grows well but I just started
cutting this plant and we are at number of the sets the last one that I need to
make cuts of today this was number one plant funny enough and I started cutting
off the the stems and and and immediately got like a heavy heavy
aroma of pine this is really cool I thought that was like almost like pine
and lemon like something very like the other plants they have some great aromas
but this one was like like when you cut the plant open is when it released that
kind of aroma which is really cool have you seen that all right there we go my
screen got funny it's cool you say that because one of my favorite the way that
I selected Pam 15 and and kind of found her out of the group when she was young
was when I was trimming up the plants that pulled off a family for big old
big old family if I was this thing I smell and that's one of the things that
I do as I break off one of the big kind of mid in the mid section of the of the
plant one of the main features a good solid heavy fed leaf you know I'll break
it off and I'll smell the the chlorophyll the blood of the plant you
know I'll really smell it sometimes I'll taste it see if it's a different color
it notice anything like that but when you broke off the the family on Pam 15
when she was a baby you immediately had this crazy like this this spicy zesty
like you opened a bag of like Doritos chips of some sort like a really powerful
like salsa verde was like this really powerful smell really pungent really
kind of really sour and and pungent smell and it was only when you broke the
leaf and opened up the plant actually smelled the tissue of the plant so I
always keep lookouts for plants it did it do that and then when I flowered out
Pam's gonna be that 15 I put a little tag on her and she went through the line
and we looked at a bunch of different stuff and it turned out that now that
was the one that I liked from you know in the end and all those things it was
one of those things it was like wow you just rubbing it it wasn't the same it
was when you often have a really healthy one that was healthy and full of life
you know you'd be like whoa and it was super pungent and wouldn't last very long
it was like a fart in the wind you know what I mean it was like it's like there
immediately dissipated it was like it was like a flash in the pan like it's
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah still to this day I always do that's one of the things
I love doing with with that plant you know because it's best found when you
get to do that you know it's really interesting it's not a lot of plants do
that you know and there's some plants you know Bodie has some plants the
dragon bloodline that you do that it bleeds red that blood is not green it's
red which is really interesting you know that's really cool I always thought that
was a cool feature so you know I always take note of stuff like that so that's
cool you say that because yeah it's only when you bust open into the plant a
little bit and get one of those those nice little leaves or cut a main point
you know it'll tell you so if you found that coastal where you snapped a stem
you've had that kind of a scent come out of her oh yeah back in the early to
late 2000s I did maybe I can't count too well a few thousand Mexicans and I found
all sorts of crazy stuff and we found like red and purple of basically sap on
the the plant you also found like things like you could find the like Oh hook on
and the local gold fucking phenos and then a lot of Afghan was mixed into it
was a lot of dirty muddied up stuff but occasionally you could get that kind of
stuff and then you get some like root beer phenos no um but yeah I ran through
about 3,000 of them and I found a few it was it was very rare but I did find a
few with like red to purple sap in them there really wasn't much difference in
the potency or anything with the plant it was just a nice cool thing but you
know it was a thing that the best plan I found was actually what looked like the
precursor to the Cali Oh which was a old-school Mexican sativa that was orange
flavored that never stops flowering like you literally have to harvest part
of the plant before it finishes because it will literally rot it'll because it
just keep going going going um but yeah that that was the precursor to the
original Cali Oh and I had found that and that was probably the best thing I
had found out of all of it but uh yeah as far as the resin or I guess the sap
goes yeah it is something that's common you can find that it's it's it's a neat
thing but I'm not sure if it's related to anything potency related how about
you Corey you're talking about smelling veg I guess I smell things in veg I
don't have any correlation to what they mean because I haven't really I mean I
can't put a smell and veg together with something in our I mean truthfully I
have a hard time you know distinguishing different smells that I get in flower I
mean you know I can I can tell sweet versus sour and things like that but as
far as pinpointed down you know I could smell berries and things like that and
flower but but like doing that stem rub just now I could smell like it smelt
like mr. trees was describing maybe a spicy or you know some kind of a smell
like that but to say cinnamon or I really am NOT good I've heard mean jeans
a dill pickle or maybe or something like that I I smell different things sometimes
I just smell plant sometimes like you say when I'm cutting clones I'll get a
whip or something and I'm like looking around where it's coming from and you
know it's it's obviously coming from what I just clipped so as far as being
descript and chasing something I think that I can definitely say if I smell
that smell I'll be able to trace it and follow it around but I'm not able to
distinguish it from one smell from the next unfortunately I wish I was better at
it so mr. trees have you noticed when you're getting the different odors that
you're getting a different profile on the plant at all or is that something
that you've really looked at at all there's no there's nothing that I've
ever smelled it like ends up the way that it is you know in the end when it
actually starts to flower and all those things happen it changes so rapidly but
when they're in vegetative state and they have an above-average scent
compared to this do the other stock around it I always take notice of those
and I find a way to you know put a mark on them or note them in some way so that
as they go to the end of the line they might turn out to be good they might
they might turn out to be nothing and more times than not the stinkiest plants
in veg sometimes aren't the best ones you know what I mean it's it's the more
reserved ones that were slower to go the ones you had the least amount of
expectation for that you took the least amount of clones of the the one that is
always usually the one that I get screwed with it turns out to be the
winner but sometimes like in that in the pan 15 case when I when I marked it I was
like wow what the fuck is that I had never smelled it like that before I
smelled lots of things and sometimes they smell like just like a plant
sometimes they get a little bit of this and you can tell it's just a you know
it's nothing special but when you really get one that's got something
funky to it and you're like whoa that's really be there you know what I mean in
a weird way you know that's like you know I like noting those and then seeing
what happens in the end with them but like she changes the 15 changes so much
from like what that smell is to what it really is you know it's like completely
different smell by a lot if you were like to compare the smells you know to
each other you know but it told me to kind of keep that eye out on it you know
I mean it's it had a little something extra to it you know I thought London
you were grabbing a microphone you're grabbing the bong right no no I've
managed to cut most of the cuts that are necessary for the evening anyway so
I can take a little bit of a breather I got some stuff from the cutting book one
and I got to do some cuts from so which is actually really need you got some
really like lemon it lemony leaning fit you know is which is really fun some
hollow stem stuff I was thinking kind of cool like if you can get a really
consistently hollow stem plant to make straws out of them they ought to be
something cool for like a gastro bar something or nutrient deprive it or
something to get there or something like that growth practice that'd be cool it's
good idea it's interesting be the straw the hemp straw guy that just throws him
naturally you're gonna have to do much process in a couple clips I bet you but
dip them then you could just dip them right like you dip them in a resin or
something like that so that they would not die or rot away and then they do
something similar with bamboo I have like giant stocks right here I mean you
can see this right can you see this like this thing like man I mean that's that's
a real deal I have big hands you know you know this thing is I feel like I
can't even get you to the top of it there's another three feet of this kind
of going but that's been around since what year is that 2014 or 2015 right
something like that was when I grew that plant right there and I was gonna make
this into a mic stand and do all kinds of rock and roll stuff with it and I
just never got around to doing it but this thing is still perfect as it ever
was and if it was a little bunch of little straws I bet you they'd be just
fine without dipping them in anything you know I mean if you store them in a
dry climate you know wet in Canada you might have a problem but yeah it's only
in BC in Alberta it's dry here we don't have to worry about that moisture you
know it's so dry your skin falls off it's so fucking dry that's how dry it is
in Alberta fuck your whole shit you know some you know that you know almost a
decade this thing's been around like that and it's and it's just as badass
I hope one day you chase some guy that that like that's tried to betroth your
daughter or something like that like with a fucking giant stick of weed like
I would be okay if I got beaten up with it with like
you know you take them out with a weed spear you know but no I have a I have
this electric pruners called the Felco 820 so anybody wants to Google that
it'll blow your mind it's called the Felco 820 and it's just
backpack handheld pruner like this that can hack through friggin branches that
are like two two inches three inches it'll cut for 24 hours I'll have to just
like a job the life of something yes it's fucking badass dude it's it's it's
it's so badass it's not even funny right and if I ever had a daughter I don't
have one but I always joke that I'd sit him down in the garage and I'd pull up
the like these crazy gnarly logs and I would just turn that thing on and just
start hacking the logs and the pieces like with little buttons you know what
I mean on the logs and just talk to him about you know how I had to take care of
you know take care of my daughter properly you know what I mean because
that thing with a push of a button I could take off all of my fingers you
know I mean just an accident they would be gone there's no stopping it you know
I mean it just would take it off so you put somebody's junk in there or a toe or
something like that that's that's that's a problem for anybody you know what I
mean so that was always my joke luckily I don't have a daughter so I'm good
we're talking old-school now
what do you so it's spring you've got some projects coming up I bet there's
some exciting things happening in the world of mr. trees right now I've seen
some epic photos like some mango stuff yeah man things like that I'm trying to
get like more of my market garden thing going on here so I've been working
really hard every night and tonight I'll even go out throw the headlamp on work
for a couple hours out there getting all the all these different beds ready so
you know just basically like you got a little plot of land you dig it up till
it up like a badass and then get some logs from around your area your firewood
or a couple old fence boards or whatever and you make yourself a little just kind
of make yourself a little bed and then dump some compost and some stuff and you
know worm castings and kind of till it up a few times and water it a few times
and been planting them out and some of them you know you know you put together
little bean tunnels they call them bean tunnels so it's like trellises where
beans and shit hang down you know tomatoes and shit hang down over the top
of it and you can pick them I've been doing a lot of tunnels like that and I've
been getting you know the the home grow a little bed ready to roll and I'm
thinking about doing like a show kind of like this you know with you guys like
grow a you know like grow a giant with mr. trees you know all through the
season so planting and planting planting the plant the way that I do it you know
and in the earth in the bed do one plant and you know grow it big and beautiful
and badass and show you all the things that I do to it and see what we get in
the end you know what I mean like and do a check-in thing with it something like
that I don't know anybody want to watch something like that but I've been
thinking about maybe maybe dedicating a little bed to a show you know so I think
that we're all my worms what was that I said I think that would be totally cool
myself yep I'm in I definitely watch it a hundred percent right on nice nice
yeah you know I've been thinking about doing that so that's something that I
bought into and I got a little place I think I might dedicate for it you know
we'll see we'll see if I get you know see if I can get it get it going on
that'd be pretty cool I've been working hard on the on the worm beds I'm trying
to launch you know my my worm side of my business you know what I mean cuz I grow
trees I sell trees and we do orchard stuff I farm worms everybody always
wants to buy my worm elixirs and my stuff that I use on on their trees
making a lot more of that stuff just a couple things right here and shaking up
making all kinds of little that I've been I got to use up in the garden later
another one you know they just sit here they don't they don't separate or
anything you know which is friggin awesome that means they're really really
rich and your humics in your your fulvics and your stuff like that where
it's it's just kind of water-soluble man just it's beautiful it's really cool
I've been making these worm casting balls that are like aged from three year
casting beds that I have you know I have some that are like three years old you
know two years old one years old a few months old and some are fed different
things to change the nutrient value but they're all fed with hundreds of fruits
and vegetables from my farm so like all the weird fruits the avocados the you
know the berries the peaches the melons all the shit that we don't eat goes in
the friggin worm bed and they multiply like sons of bitches and you know are we
gonna be able to buy some vermicompost that's what I mean yeah yeah yeah so I
want to start finding a way I'm gonna I'm gonna send some of the worm my
special worm balls with the super crazy casting balls to Peter we're gonna send
those because they're not heavy you know and you can ship that but shipping big
heavy bags of shit it's gonna be like yeah that's that's gonna be way down the
line for shipping purposes but there's gonna be different ways that I'm gonna
try to infiltrate my ship worms one special worms you know from the farm and
you know the elixir and all kinds of stuff I'm trying to find different ways
to get get those to the farmers markets and to the people you know what I mean
cuz this right here I mean literally every day I leave I never leave home
without this stuff you know I'll make it right when I got out of like the best
fucking castings you've ever seen I'll put up a post after this of the stuff
that I've been putting in that you know it's just crazy it's hell it's insane
little does everybody knows mr. trees is actually 800 years old and he bathes in
it daily and that's how he managed to stay looking so fucking young. The worm elixir.
But that's that's my secret sauce man that's one of my favorite things that I
do that I use that I've been working hard on making better organization on
the worm farm and then on the real farm growing carrots and pumpkins and cool
shit like that you know which is cool. So is that a leachate or are you actually
like taking the castings and putting them in water and stripping out the
humic and folic that way? Both. Both of those are in this these ones that I made
right there. So I have like they'll be a mature bed right call it a mature bed
a bed that's been properly worked for you know a year by worms and they've
turned all that good stuff up in the like pure castings is the driven you
know earth right. So I'll take those and I'll take like an avocado or a melon or
something like that and I'll put that half of one of those on the surface of
the of the castings and take out everything else and then within a couple
days all or the majority of the worms will be up inside that melon or those
avocados and then I can just take them out of the bed and put them in a
holding zone for a little bit and then I can take water and flood out that bed
really really well and let all that leachate stuff and all the fucking
worm goods come through and that first that first batch of stuff the first
couple batches of stuff will come through and I'll collect it in the big
buckets and those go right out on the on the trees they're they're a little bit
thinner they're not as like potent and rich and then as it as it really starts
getting in down in there it really starts getting dark dark black and
really beautiful looking and I start filling up the jugs with that and we use
that and I mix that with real castings really high quality castings just the
hand like it's I call them casting balls and I'll roll up a you know it's
like a ping-pong ball of the friggin chronic castings and I'll stuff that in
one of those jugs and you know I'll shake that puppy up and you kind of got
the best of both worlds like right there sometimes I'll take that leap depending
on how old or how mature the bed is if it's not you know at least a year old if
it's younger than that or even a year old bed I still would like to cut that
with more water just to be you know like cut that 50-50 as it came out into
the jug and probably fill it up halfway with water and then I take my casting
ball and I throw it in there and I shake it up and and do it that way but the
older the the more refined the more rich it's like you have the more potent good
crazy stuff that you could mix down you know friggin 500 to 1 or really and
still get some kick-ass benefit out of it you know it's amazing how you know
it'll just change the water and just have stuff that the plant loves and they
stand up like nobody's business all the time you know what I mean they're just
happy to have it you can tell you know so yeah it's just cool it's just
something I've been doing for years man that I just been doing and people keep
asking me can I buy some of your stuff so I've been making some stuff up and
giving it to them and leaving everybody want your child and on doorsteps and
stuff trying to get get to people but it'd be nice to get some castings out
you know start bagging some stuff up and have some local stuff here or yes come
drive to the farm and pick them up you know I love I love it I got a great yard
and I got a lot of worms in it and every every few days I can go outside and just
pick worm castings up off my yard it's like every single time it's absolutely
epic I've been trying to figure out how to get how do you get a small population
of worms to survive in a three gallon pot with a weed plant in it a big one
but we're having challenges with dry off so we got to start figuring that off a
little bit but I think once you get to a critical size that we plant you run
out of room for the worms so I think it's like yeah the challenge that I'm
running into right now but anyways aside from that I really had a question for
you say market gardens or you are there some particular what are like your your
go-to money vegetables you know like what are the what are the things that
like make you money and keep you not working so hard when it comes to market
garden vegetables I'm a huge fan of carrots because it's like fucking done
you know like and they're always like you get care of leaves once in a while
and you spray them they dealt with you pretty quick like is there is there
anything in particular that you really enjoy or I'm like you're right on you're
right on with carrots you know I love doing carrots carrots are bitching dude
you can do all kinds of them you can do the round ones the colorful ones the
short ones the long ones friggin it's it's they're cool and we use them a lot
so it's something that I actually will eat here my kids eat everybody eats so I
always have like two or three giant beds of carrots like yeah 10 by 10 by 8 or 20
by 5 or whatever beds full of friggin carrots because those are super
important they sell pretty darn good they're one of the the things that will
sell especially the cool colorful ones I like doing root crops too because you
know potatoes and turmeric garlic stuff like that I like doing root crops
number one because they sell pretty good and number two you get less bug damage
and issues with them you know I'm inks are under the ground stuff you sell
those under the ground you know what I mean so it's like you know you're not
getting like you don't have to sell them like lettuce leaves or something that
has like you know snail damage or holes in this one you're not having to clean
it all up and worry about all that shenanigans you know what I mean or
tomatoes that are getting and they're not like like fucking they're not
susceptible like turnips or anything you know like flash burn radishes you know
like they can get eaten up and drilled into pretty bad yeah yeah carrots
will find her a little bit more resilient yep you get some earwigs and
some pill you know some pill bugs you know roly-poly's you get a couple of
slugs in there you know you're in trouble you know what I mean I haven't
got a huge population of roly-poly but radishes and stuff are good moneymakers
like good French purple ones and stuff because they grow pretty quick they're
like super quick crop you can get on as long as you can protect them for a
little bit you know you're you're pretty good and you can kind of turn them
around pretty darn good and they're neat not enough people eat radishes but corn
poppin corn flower corn I have that black radish the French one or the the
Hungarian black radish I forget exactly where it's from is is I have that black
radish in in my cover crop friend I love it you get like you get to the end of
your round and the plants been in there for you know three four months and you
have a little radish it's like Oh harvest snack on my radish yeah yeah
exactly exactly you know um but yeah carrots are one of my big ones passion
fruit that's one of the weird things that you wouldn't you don't think about
but I got passion fruit vines that kind of cover my hole there my wall of my
around my whole house and they they just you know we got tons of passion fruit
and you wouldn't think but people love passion fruit and they're really good
for you so that's one of the things that that will go pretty good what else
is fun that we do sugarcane I've been doing a lot of funky like you know I've
been I need to get a sugarcane juicer a sugarcane press man anybody want to make
a trade you got a sugarcane press that you know just an old one you roll a
sugarcane you cut it in half and roll it through the thing just kind of hand
little crank little cold press or something for sugarcane I want to get
one of those to make more sugarcane juice that would be badass but uh you
know cutting the sugarcane up into clones and then popping those up and
selling sugarcane as a plant that's one of the things people love interesting
just cool like what's the temperature like I've never even seen sugarcane in
the grocery store like no grocery store what if I had a plant store here I
imagine that it's like it's like a fuck no zone is there like is it is that what
it is like is I'm so tough man I mean is it like you wouldn't think about it you
think that sugarcane is like this this tropical thing on islands and can you
know but like honestly it's one of the things that I water the least I cared
for it you know less than everything else never dies just keeps multiplying
it's like well it's like a friggin weed once I planted it it just multiplies and
you can't get rid of it and that's what the lady told me because it's a it's a
particular type of sugarcane it's delicious it's got killer sugar it's
beautiful it's from somewhere like I mean I think she said Trinidad or
something she was from Trinidad if that memory serves or something like that or
somewhere there about somewhere one of those one of those places and she said
she she had it from there and she she brought it here and it's a complete weed
and she said wherever I plant it you know expected to take take that place
and kind of take over and I didn't you know I didn't expect that to be a hundred
percent the way it was because I was like oh sugarcane exotic but man it's a
weed it's like this big grassy bamboo thing grows awesome yeah if it gets you
know if you're getting snow on the ground I don't I don't think you're
gonna have any success you know growing it without some sort of protection or
cover it can die down and come up from the root points you don't need very much
of it at all one or two buds will activate and grow really really easy
it's like easy cloning plant low low care it gets it likes to get little
aphids and stuff but you can blast all that crap off with water and commercially
they spray them with all kinds of crap I don't know what the deal is but it's a
really easy plant to grow so but I found it's like unusual it's useful as
hell you can do all kinds with sugarcane if you grew some sugarcane you can like
make fuel out of it you can juice it it's really nutritious like coconut
water and stuff like that it's it's tough doesn't take a lot of resources to
grow you know I mean I like I said it's it it's sad in a place at my house that
like hardly ever got water it wasn't loved it was like I just planted it
there and it was one of the spaces that didn't have water to it you know and I
was like I'll get water to that eventually and it friggin kicks ass so
now I get water it's got water now it grows well but it lasted a long time
without water and any help you know so it turned a spot for sure here but it's
an unusual one but you can do it if you got a greenhouse you pull it inside you
know what I mean some way I think I could probably pull it off I think you
probably pull it off but I mean I'm sure dude that there's a way to do it
you know because it's it's not I mean I've got like I've got stevia this is
kind of my funnest newest plant is stevia I've got like a little stevia
doing pretty good here that's you get 24 seeds for five bucks like it's almost as
expensive as weed it's like gotta be like the most expensive fucking vegetable
or herb seed I actually know there was one there was there's some tomato and
pepper seeds that are like fuck you expensive nothing like nothing too crazy
but like you know not like weed not like when you love not like some of these
people charging like you know $300 for a pack of 10 yeah I get it well this one
was this one was epic because it's just like I had to plant all the seeds and I
only got like three plants out of it but they're delicious and it's like such an
awesome snack yeah you don't got to do anything to those that's where it's so
cool about the stevia is you just pull off the leaves and it's just sweet and
tasty you know it's better than when it's processed you know for sure it's a
good way way different the way I like way better than I was expecting. Moringa, that's the other one that's the other one I grow a lot of that people like that is
worthy it is easy but I love I wouldn't do anything without it you know I put
that in compost I give that to the worms I eat that it's the bomb that's a cool
tree you know you can grow moringa trees grow moringa trees there. How big do they grow?
Dude, they can get big. You can keep them real small you just prune the shit out of them and eat them you know what I mean like prune them down keep them small eat them keep them small you'll keep them
stunted but I mean I've seen them with you know a trunk this big that stood 15
you know 20 feet tall maybe somewhere in there you know somewhere yeah somewhere
in that realm and that was the biggest one that I've ever seen here I've seen
pictures of them with bigger trunks but usually their heads are people are eating
the leaves and stuff like that keeps them keeps them smaller and usually at
a young age they were used for stuff so you hack them down so they branch out
lower you can kind of just use them like a you know a salad type crop it's a
freaking tree but it's the most powerful leaves you can friggin eat and they're
delicious and the bomb so that's one that I like. I've got a fuck ton of holy basil that I got to figure out
something to do with you ever holy basil you ever have that before it's got like
holy fuck this stuff has like a brilliant aroma brilliant smell to it but I like I
don't know what to do with it yet I'm like I'm not gonna chef it I don't know
I think it's like it's more there's something else I can do with this.
Coastal growing mix what's up? That's a fun one I do the African blue that one comes
back for me all the time it's pretty it's like a more perennial basil you
know it gets more tall that's the one that just grows here all the time so I
don't usually you know every once in a while I'll buy a basil plant from the
store like you know that living basil plant you know for stuff and then I'll
just I'll use what I need for whatever I bought it for and then I'll clone it and
then I'll pop what was there and then I'll cut off the heads and make clones
out of it because they root in like five days and water and then I've got basil for
however long so it gets cold and I'll use those basils until they die but that
African blue always comes back and is always tough and that's a good one I like that one.
What were you trying to say there Coastal Grown? Okay back on the sugarcane
thing my family is originally from Puerto Rico back from like 1754 they
were given land by the King of Spain on the western half like most of it and
they had a ton of sugarcane plantation and it's funny that like y'all mentioned
that because like eventually in the 1900s when they had the anti-alcohol
laws what they resorted to was having to make rum with the damn sugarcane but
then like it's funny as shit because then they look at me like I'm a fucking
alien about like weed and it's just hilarious like is the pot like
calling the kettle black or what's going on here but yeah I just I learned how to
thank you for smoking weed yeah so yeah and I was involved in making moonshine
back in the day even too I used to do that stuff as well but like I I just I
don't understand how someone could say alcohol is better than weed when weeds
never caused anyone any harm but yeah I just thought that was a funny thing that
dimension it was like yeah oh yeah I've grown sugarcane before and like Tyler
said it does not eat any nutrients it's really you just throw it in a pot with
some soil let it go of water and it does its thing and it just goes and goes and
goes it looks like basically bamboo it's just the grass just proliferates but
yeah that was that was my little rant about sugarcane and all that yeah that's
one of my old you know you got a plant plants that are gonna be useful to you
I've got like timber bamboo on one side so that you know if I ever need timber
we got timber bamboo growing you know I got sugarcane you can do a lot of things
with sugarcane you know I've got a lot of plants that are like that in my place
you know so like like it's survival plants right like plants that every
human being should have yeah can you wait timber bamboo what I'm thinking it
is like timber bamboo is the type of bamboo used for building right like
that's the it's like a really yeah that's big-ass bamboo that have shoots
that are like you know tree shoots like that and there's there's one the one
that I have is called old ham I and old ham I yeah and that's a killer one it's
golden bamboo big-ass big guys you know shoots on it there's other things but
timber bamboo is just heavy-duty tough thick bamboo that is used for building
structures in many countries and is a building material and lots of things
which is cool so it's a useful a useful plant you know they can go like 55 60
you know I don't know exactly how somewhere like 50 feet tall somewhere in
there tall and be just yeah it's bitchin it's pretty cool it's like you're
growing a big 60 foot friggin poles you know what I mean that you can just pack
down and use for whatever you know pretty cool so that's what they use for
scaffolding that you see in the Orient where they build the big scaffolding out
of it that'd be the the tree bamboo one yep oh that's it okay well it is almost
nine o'clock I've realized now that I have promised to read my daughter a
bedtime story yes and it's and it's like an hour past her bedtime and she's used
it as now a BS excuse to stay the fuck up like fuck you like you're smart
fucking pain in the ass but we are actually pretty close to the two-hour
mark just second I'm on my way gotta keep the girls happy London I I'm
surrounded by them so yes there's more women around me than men is me and three
girls absolutely exotic I love them to death yeah we are gonna be back so in
two weeks we're gonna have clones and we should be able to up pot so I'll
probably go straight into eight and then I should have some plant sexes by then
we should be I don't know if Coriel will you be cutting then I am probably
by then or then yes cool cool cool and what about you coastal are you gonna be
cutting by then I am holding out as hard as I can so I can get as much biomass as
I can off I'm literally just like sitting here like stubborn stubborn
headed just like okay they're ready to go into flying they're gonna be 10 feet
tall indoors and I'm just like okay okay I'm just like so I'm oh yeah I'm I'm
probably gonna have to cut them in the next week or so but I'm holding off as
much as I can I love that so just as a reminder to everybody you can catch mr.
trees is all of his seeds including the stuff that we're running in this show in
the description I've got the right at the very very top of the description is
is mr. seeds trees mr. trees seeds I'm always fucked that up every fucking time
and every single what we're bi-weekly Saturdays where we're gonna keep going
through everything well should have flowering plant we've been we've been

some really fun shit to happen it's been a wildly good time we've had some
amazing introspective conversations I have you has a special guest on Tuesday
at the dank hour which I'm excited for which is gonna be great that will be our
breeder episode so tune in for that one because we're doing it every every six
or eight weeks we do a breeder episode where we run through like a new step of
the breeder so mr. trees will get a heads up we're gonna be talking and
usually usually the experts don't get their heads up I like to just throw them
in and tell them like whatever the fuck we're gonna talk about it as we started
off last week's conversation with active asking dr. melt mark Saldon if there was
a specific terpene that he's managed to isolate or find or discover that makes
people particularly passionate about the Grateful Dead and he actually answered
it really well so apparently there might be and he's still looking for it
which is crazy I have no idea that would actually be the answer with sarcasm but
regardless so we're gonna be we're gonna be going through kind of like selection
stage and then like how do you breed how do you start selecting pollen donors and
making that selection for it there too so that'll be part two of the dank hour
breeder series which will be great and a lot of fun anyways does anybody have
anything else exciting that they want to mention that's coming up I just have my
show coming up on Monday we're missing John Burr fellow again he's in courses
