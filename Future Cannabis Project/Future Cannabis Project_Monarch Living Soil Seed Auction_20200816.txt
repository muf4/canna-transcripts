[00:00.000 --> 00:03.100]  BX, that's a fucking one to go after.
[00:13.770 --> 00:15.570]  Then half the guys I have on this seed company,
[00:15.570 --> 00:17.250]  I just wanna grow their gear
[00:17.250 --> 00:20.050]  and fucking not even worry about doing my own shit.
[00:20.050 --> 00:22.670]  All right, so we just went live.
[00:24.670 --> 00:26.810]  So this is what we're talking about
[00:26.810 --> 00:30.610]  for everybody who was here 45 minutes ago.
[00:30.610 --> 00:35.610]  So let me up, here comes Kevin.
[00:36.410 --> 00:38.850]  Kevin is now in.
[00:38.850 --> 00:40.210]  We got a bowl of peaches.
[00:45.570 --> 00:47.930]  Let me mute Nick's audio.
[00:49.210 --> 00:50.810]  Welcome Kevin.
[00:50.810 --> 00:53.430]  Yo, that was a good show you did today.
[00:55.090 --> 00:56.650]  Yeah, no, Dan did great.
[00:56.690 --> 00:57.530]  And.
[00:58.650 --> 01:01.470]  No, I mean, Jesse and Jackson were going off.
[01:02.330 --> 01:05.930]  I didn't catch the last half, but I kind of skimmed through
[01:05.930 --> 01:07.810]  and I was like, whoa shit, they're going deep.
[01:07.810 --> 01:09.570]  Cool, I gotta get back to it.
[01:12.250 --> 01:13.210]  How you doing Josh?
[01:14.170 --> 01:15.010]  I'm good, man.
[01:16.010 --> 01:18.210]  I was thinking I'm gonna grab myself out, dude.
[01:18.210 --> 01:21.530]  It's 82 degrees here in the shade and I'm dying.
[01:21.530 --> 01:24.170]  Oh, that's hysterical, it's fucking 102 here.
[01:24.170 --> 01:25.730]  I know, I heard you talk about the other day
[01:25.730 --> 01:27.530]  and my stomach out there getting my ass kicked.
[01:27.530 --> 01:30.290]  And it's like, you know, 98 in the sun, but.
[01:30.290 --> 01:32.330]  Yeah, we're like 122, like my, you know,
[01:32.330 --> 01:37.330]  my sun temp's like 122 and shade temp, you know, 102.
[01:37.370 --> 01:39.250]  But you know, you get used to it.
[01:39.250 --> 01:40.090]  Yeah.
[01:40.090 --> 01:44.690]  Just stay hydrated and do the damn job.
[01:45.610 --> 01:47.090]  It's really all the way around.
[01:47.090 --> 01:48.130]  Today was rough.
[01:48.130 --> 01:49.490]  I was cracking those,
[01:49.490 --> 01:52.330]  I'd been drinking those carbonated waters, you know,
[01:52.330 --> 01:53.810]  the St. Croix's or whatever.
[01:54.130 --> 01:57.090]  Just, I think I drank six or seven of those today.
[01:57.090 --> 02:00.970]  No, no, I got up at, I went up the hill at like six.
[02:00.970 --> 02:02.730]  So I got up at five, went up the hill at six
[02:02.730 --> 02:06.930]  so I could get a block of work done before the sun come out.
[02:06.930 --> 02:09.410]  And, cause once that shit hits, you know,
[02:09.410 --> 02:10.570]  you have to deal with it.
[02:10.570 --> 02:13.090]  But if I could, you know, catch a couple hours
[02:13.090 --> 02:15.090]  where it wasn't full a hundred on the body,
[02:15.090 --> 02:18.170]  cause like, I just think you soak the energy in.
[02:18.170 --> 02:19.010]  Yeah.
[02:19.010 --> 02:23.730]  And you, you come home, man, and you just like cranky.
[02:24.810 --> 02:27.130]  And the kids are like,
[02:27.130 --> 02:27.970]  You're like wanting to play, you're like,
[02:27.970 --> 02:30.610]  I need 20 minutes to go stick my head in the cold shower.
[02:30.610 --> 02:31.450]  I need some time, baby.
[02:31.450 --> 02:32.530]  Yeah, no, my daughter's like, just go for a walk.
[02:32.530 --> 02:33.570]  I'm like, we're not going for a walk.
[02:33.570 --> 02:34.410]  I'm fucking beat up, man.
[02:34.410 --> 02:35.250]  Help me out.
[02:35.250 --> 02:37.610]  Help your old man out, I'm old.
[02:37.610 --> 02:39.610]  But it's, you know, it's been fun
[02:39.610 --> 02:41.850]  cause I've been going through a lot of mails, you know?
[02:41.850 --> 02:45.130]  And so I've been using the afternoon heat to do that.
[02:45.130 --> 02:46.250]  I've been hitting them in the morning,
[02:46.250 --> 02:49.170]  kind of in the afternoon, I do my main selections.
[02:49.170 --> 02:51.050]  And in the morning I come back and do a double check.
[02:51.050 --> 02:52.570]  And then, you know, the next afternoon
[02:52.570 --> 02:55.290]  I make my final swath,
[02:55.290 --> 02:58.490]  but it's been kind of a nice routine for me, to be honest.
[02:59.570 --> 03:00.410]  Oh, totally.
[03:01.770 --> 03:03.810]  What are you digging through?
[03:03.810 --> 03:05.810]  Today I was going through the oil spill
[03:06.690 --> 03:09.130]  by Ben Emerald Mountain Legacy.
[03:09.130 --> 03:13.450]  And I went through that and just a handful of,
[03:13.450 --> 03:15.490]  I was actually just calling out the mails
[03:15.490 --> 03:18.890]  from some SkyJarro and some SkyJarro ghost OGs,
[03:18.890 --> 03:20.890]  cause I already made selections out of bigger rounds.
[03:20.890 --> 03:22.170]  And so.
[03:22.170 --> 03:23.010]  Gotcha.
[03:23.850 --> 03:28.850]  Man, that magnum opus to the Testerosa
[03:29.250 --> 03:31.930]  that I got from you, that thing's shining outside.
[03:31.930 --> 03:32.930]  Is it?
[03:32.930 --> 03:34.210]  Yeah, she's looking beautiful here, man.
[03:34.210 --> 03:36.210]  Handling it, it's just shining.
[03:36.210 --> 03:38.650]  On the cut or was it, did you pop some beans?
[03:38.650 --> 03:39.730]  No, it was the cut you gave me.
[03:39.730 --> 03:40.570]  The cut, yeah.
[03:40.570 --> 03:42.690]  That, it's a really cool one, man.
[03:42.690 --> 03:45.290]  And I'm so bad, I'm harvesting that stuff right now.
[03:45.290 --> 03:46.570]  So I'm going through the females.
[03:46.570 --> 03:48.650]  I already pulled two or three males
[03:48.650 --> 03:49.770]  and I'm going through the females.
[03:49.770 --> 03:51.370]  And it's really cool, man.
[03:51.410 --> 03:54.930]  Cause you can really, really see the nuance.
[03:54.930 --> 03:56.850]  You know, there's probably a quarter
[03:56.850 --> 03:58.370]  of the flavor profile that I'm after,
[03:58.370 --> 04:00.650]  but digging through that quarter is where I'm at.
[04:00.650 --> 04:01.490]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:01.490 --> 04:03.570]  You gotta put the work in.
[04:03.570 --> 04:04.410]  Yeah.
[04:04.410 --> 04:05.250]  No, she's pretty.
[04:05.250 --> 04:06.290]  And it's hard, it's kind of hard to decide
[04:06.290 --> 04:08.090]  cause you're like, oh, this one's a little more limey.
[04:08.090 --> 04:09.610]  This one's a little bit more danky.
[04:09.610 --> 04:13.370]  Like, do I have to choose?
[04:13.370 --> 04:14.210]  Oh no, no.
[04:14.210 --> 04:16.810]  You know, you know, you know how that works good is
[04:16.810 --> 04:19.130]  if you got other partners you roll with,
[04:19.170 --> 04:21.370]  you can, you can, because otherwise I have
[04:21.370 --> 04:24.930]  like an emotional breakdown when I got to kill this shit.
[04:24.930 --> 04:26.450]  Cause I know it's fire.
[04:26.450 --> 04:27.970]  And I know that as soon as I kill it,
[04:27.970 --> 04:30.770]  the market will ask for exactly that.
[04:30.770 --> 04:32.290]  Right.
[04:32.290 --> 04:34.370]  And I'm like, fuck.
[04:34.370 --> 04:36.450]  So, you know, you're trying to keep all these copies
[04:36.450 --> 04:38.530]  and I just find like, you know, I try to get some buddies
[04:38.530 --> 04:42.370]  that are doing a small scale work
[04:42.370 --> 04:44.850]  and then they got some heady shit.
[04:44.850 --> 04:46.410]  And then there's still people
[04:46.410 --> 04:51.370]  that have their own clandestine BHO scenes.
[04:51.370 --> 04:54.410]  So that I got friends that like to hit the oil heavy
[04:54.410 --> 04:56.650]  and then I pass them killer shit
[04:56.650 --> 04:58.490]  and then they have it blown.
[04:58.490 --> 05:02.290]  And then I get to see the product coming back.
[05:03.810 --> 05:05.850]  So I get to see it in some different forms,
[05:05.850 --> 05:07.690]  but it's just, it's nice to be able to, you know
[05:07.690 --> 05:10.690]  move the plants cause otherwise you end up
[05:10.690 --> 05:12.690]  you can't keep all of them.
[05:12.690 --> 05:13.530]  Right.
[05:13.530 --> 05:15.970]  You know, and some of the shit's too nice to get rid of
[05:16.530 --> 05:17.930]  but you have to.
[05:17.930 --> 05:20.890]  I'm trying to make this really about the male selection
[05:20.890 --> 05:21.890]  for me this year.
[05:21.890 --> 05:23.610]  And he is getting a handful of males
[05:23.610 --> 05:25.970]  and focusing on what they can do.
[05:25.970 --> 05:28.410]  And then if I get a handful more females, that's great
[05:28.410 --> 05:30.010]  out of what I'm going through.
[05:30.850 --> 05:33.650]  But then I can just start working that stuff, you know
[05:33.650 --> 05:34.610]  and digging through.
[05:34.610 --> 05:35.930]  Totally, totally.
[05:35.930 --> 05:39.050]  Yeah, no, I haven't done a really hard male job in a minute
[05:39.050 --> 05:44.050]  just because all my business operations kind of shifted
[05:44.610 --> 05:46.810]  into working with a bigger company.
[05:46.810 --> 05:50.610]  And so the priority is to focus on their deal, not mine.
[05:50.610 --> 05:52.770]  And I'm cool with that cause it's the business.
[05:52.770 --> 05:56.810]  But the last one I did was I did a really good selection
[05:56.810 --> 06:01.330]  on some chem dogs special and I pulled out a nasty male.
[06:01.330 --> 06:04.210]  And then I ended up passing it to a partner of mine
[06:04.210 --> 06:07.170]  named Kev from Compton Genetics.
[06:07.170 --> 06:09.490]  And so Kev from Compton Genetics, he was
[06:09.490 --> 06:12.130]  he was looking for a solid male to work into all his lines.
[06:12.130 --> 06:13.810]  And I said, no, this one's the one you want, man.
[06:14.570 --> 06:17.170]  It's a gas stamping number driving animal.
[06:17.970 --> 06:21.290]  And, but I'd spent, you know, I spent a couple of years
[06:21.290 --> 06:25.730]  you know, going into the line, bringing them out, sifting
[06:25.730 --> 06:27.850]  looking for the chemotype I wanted
[06:27.850 --> 06:29.410]  and then finding the structure
[06:29.410 --> 06:31.330]  and then actually putting it into play to see
[06:31.330 --> 06:33.770]  what the progeny came out with.
[06:33.770 --> 06:34.970]  And I was juiced.
[06:34.970 --> 06:37.290]  And then I have this killer, this killer male
[06:37.290 --> 06:39.090]  that's just a gas monster.
[06:39.090 --> 06:40.850]  But there's nothing I can really do with it
[06:40.850 --> 06:43.570]  because all my business model is to really
[06:43.570 --> 06:45.290]  move other people's material.
[06:46.290 --> 06:48.610]  And so, you know, he hit me up and he said,
[06:48.610 --> 06:52.690]  hey, I'm in, I got some cool projects I want to work on.
[06:52.690 --> 06:54.850]  And I'm trying to find something that's just a
[06:54.850 --> 06:55.970]  you know, a really good male.
[06:55.970 --> 06:57.130]  And it's hard to find them.
[06:57.130 --> 07:00.690]  And people usually don't give them up, but he's a good dude.
[07:00.690 --> 07:03.570]  And he's doing some really nice work down in SoCal.
[07:03.570 --> 07:06.010]  And so I tossed him that and he's been blasting it
[07:06.010 --> 07:09.730]  into all these different OGs, Bubba's, the Pure Kush.
[07:09.730 --> 07:11.130]  He's happy.
[07:11.130 --> 07:13.010]  Yeah, because honestly, after,
[07:13.010 --> 07:14.570]  and Jackson's been the biggest help, dude.
[07:14.570 --> 07:17.690]  I talk with him, you know, once a month or so.
[07:17.690 --> 07:20.290]  And if I could just get a handful
[07:20.290 --> 07:22.850]  and I've really whittled it down with a lot of his gear,
[07:22.850 --> 07:24.890]  to be honest, a handful of males here
[07:24.890 --> 07:25.730]  that I can work with and do.
[07:25.730 --> 07:28.450]  And then I just start finding other stuff to drop into.
[07:28.450 --> 07:30.410]  I have the tool, you know,
[07:30.410 --> 07:32.850]  because that's the really thing, the thing that I see,
[07:32.850 --> 07:33.970]  you know, a lot of people are lacking.
[07:33.970 --> 07:35.850]  They may have one or two, but they don't have like,
[07:35.850 --> 07:37.890]  this is the male I make my OG with.
[07:37.890 --> 07:39.130]  This is the one I met the structure.
[07:39.730 --> 07:40.570]  They don't have the assortment.
[07:40.570 --> 07:41.410]  They don't have to put the lime on.
[07:41.410 --> 07:42.250]  Yeah.
[07:42.250 --> 07:44.690]  Like Joel was saying yesterday from my town,
[07:45.730 --> 07:46.970]  he was talking about, you know,
[07:46.970 --> 07:49.890]  how his pops taught him how to select males.
[07:49.890 --> 07:52.690]  And he's using males to add aggressiveness,
[07:52.690 --> 07:56.010]  vigor to his elite cuts that he's putting it into.
[07:56.890 --> 07:58.650]  And it was funny because people were doubting
[07:58.650 --> 08:00.210]  that he was really throwing those numbers,
[08:00.210 --> 08:01.410]  but the dude's a legend.
[08:02.330 --> 08:04.010]  He is a big plant grower.
[08:04.010 --> 08:05.570]  And so it's funny because on the internet,
[08:05.570 --> 08:07.010]  everybody's full of shit.
[08:07.010 --> 08:08.210]  And you're trying to explain to people,
[08:08.210 --> 08:10.050]  no, the fucking dude's legit.
[08:10.050 --> 08:12.570]  But unless you got some pictures or it's not real
[08:12.570 --> 08:14.690]  and you're like, well, fucking picture this.
[08:14.690 --> 08:17.170]  He's just tired, man.
[08:17.170 --> 08:18.410]  He can do it though.
[08:18.410 --> 08:21.010]  I would love to have seen that 23 pounder.
[08:21.010 --> 08:22.650]  Do you remember the Ethiopian though,
[08:22.650 --> 08:24.850]  that you and me dug into that nug in Portland?
[08:24.850 --> 08:25.690]  Yeah.
[08:26.810 --> 08:28.530]  We rolled maybe two joints out of it
[08:28.530 --> 08:30.930]  and I pulled two or three seeds out of it
[08:30.930 --> 08:33.330]  and two of them popped and one was weak
[08:33.330 --> 08:35.610]  and the other one was a female and she was strong.
[08:35.610 --> 08:38.050]  And so I've dumped a bunch of stuff
[08:38.890 --> 08:39.850]  and that's actually what I'm gonna auction off today
[08:39.850 --> 08:44.850]  is I dumped, I selected a TKG13 hash plant last fall.
[08:48.170 --> 08:50.170]  And then I dumped that on a bunch of stuff this winter.
[08:50.170 --> 08:52.010]  And so I have that on the Ethiopian.
[08:52.010 --> 08:53.730]  And so I was gonna auction that off today.
[08:53.730 --> 08:56.650]  But since that'd be nice conversation.
[08:56.650 --> 08:59.330]  That was a good conversation yesterday about Ethiopia.
[08:59.330 --> 09:03.690]  It was fascinating that cannabis isn't culturally accepted
[09:03.690 --> 09:05.570]  except for children.
[09:05.570 --> 09:07.370]  The kids smoke.
[09:08.090 --> 09:10.010]  He said the wild kid.
[09:10.010 --> 09:12.570]  The way I took that, like the no parents,
[09:12.570 --> 09:14.050]  kids on the street.
[09:14.050 --> 09:16.890]  Yeah, no, they smoke to keep them straight.
[09:16.890 --> 09:18.530]  And I'm cracking up because I'm talking,
[09:18.530 --> 09:21.530]  you're like in a society that's non-cannabis,
[09:22.650 --> 09:24.770]  our society, you give an herb to kids,
[09:24.770 --> 09:26.690]  they're putting you in prison for life.
[09:26.690 --> 09:29.130]  And in that society, that's not a cannabis society,
[09:29.130 --> 09:30.730]  it's the kids that are receiving the cannabis
[09:30.730 --> 09:32.410]  because they have the most need for it.
[09:32.410 --> 09:34.050]  Gotta calm them down.
[09:34.050 --> 09:36.610]  I'd love to go there and check it out sometime, man.
[09:36.650 --> 09:38.650]  It'd be great to go tour Africa.
[09:38.650 --> 09:42.050]  I think also when he was talking about just how high,
[09:42.050 --> 09:44.250]  like things I didn't know about Ethiopia,
[09:44.250 --> 09:46.650]  just it has that elevation and then it's low.
[09:46.650 --> 09:47.730]  Oh, me neither.
[09:47.730 --> 09:49.450]  The birthplace, dude, the birthplace.
[09:49.450 --> 09:52.730]  I mean, I've studied the Bible pretty intently
[09:52.730 --> 09:53.890]  and that's it, right?
[09:53.890 --> 09:56.770]  That's even scientifically,
[09:56.770 --> 09:59.770]  that's the birthplace of humanity for sure.
[09:59.770 --> 10:01.490]  Yeah, that valley that's this-
[10:01.490 --> 10:03.170]  Yeah, between the Tigris and the Euphrates.
[10:03.170 --> 10:05.850]  But I didn't know that the altitude was like that either.
[10:05.850 --> 10:06.690]  I didn't either.
[10:06.690 --> 10:08.130]  I wasn't aware that it was so high
[10:08.130 --> 10:09.850]  that when you fly into the airport,
[10:09.850 --> 10:11.850]  you're coming in around 10,000.
[10:11.850 --> 10:13.250]  That's like Columbia too, man.
[10:13.250 --> 10:16.730]  You fly into Bogota and you get off the plane
[10:16.730 --> 10:18.850]  and you better bring a coat
[10:18.850 --> 10:20.890]  because you're up in altitude.
[10:20.890 --> 10:25.410]  You're not in lower, you know, swampy Columbia.
[10:25.410 --> 10:26.970]  It's mountain Columbia.
[10:26.970 --> 10:30.090]  And so as soon as I met my partners that I was meeting,
[10:30.090 --> 10:34.050]  they brought me like an Indian wrap.
[10:34.050 --> 10:34.890]  And they said, here,
[10:34.890 --> 10:36.210]  we knew you were coming from the States
[10:36.210 --> 10:38.370]  and we knew you wouldn't pay attention
[10:38.370 --> 10:39.970]  to where you were going.
[10:39.970 --> 10:42.370]  And because you figured Columbia is gonna be warm.
[10:42.370 --> 10:43.370]  And I was cracking up
[10:43.370 --> 10:45.170]  because that altitude is surprising.
[10:45.170 --> 10:47.650]  And it is, it's air sucking.
[10:47.650 --> 10:49.930]  Do you have any, ever talked to any folks
[10:49.930 --> 10:52.690]  that grow up in elevation there in California,
[10:52.690 --> 10:54.890]  you know, in the Sierras?
[10:54.890 --> 10:57.050]  Not really.
[10:57.050 --> 11:00.170]  The guys that I've had the most conversation with
[11:00.170 --> 11:01.970]  in altitude is Colorado.
[11:03.170 --> 11:04.010]  Right, to be there.
[11:04.210 --> 11:06.050]  It was interesting because-
[11:06.050 --> 11:08.730]  But the temperature isn't as much and it's dry, it's drier.
[11:08.730 --> 11:10.530]  It's not the same as the, like I know the mountains.
[11:10.530 --> 11:12.610]  It's drier, but the G13,
[11:12.610 --> 11:16.410]  I had a guy that used to roll in to get stock from me,
[11:16.410 --> 11:19.970]  but he had worked some G13 lines forever.
[11:19.970 --> 11:22.970]  And he would bring in some G13
[11:22.970 --> 11:24.530]  that was from that altitude.
[11:24.530 --> 11:26.290]  And that shit was searing.
[11:27.370 --> 11:29.690]  So his yields were down, like, you know,
[11:30.410 --> 11:35.250]  he kind of said maybe 25, 30% less weight
[11:35.250 --> 11:38.050]  than if he was at a lower altitude.
[11:38.050 --> 11:42.050]  But the quality of the smoke was unbelievable.
[11:42.050 --> 11:43.650]  Just, I mean, sizzling.
[11:45.290 --> 11:46.530]  I wonder how it would do, you know,
[11:46.530 --> 11:48.050]  when you take it back, take it down,
[11:48.050 --> 11:49.850]  it gets more oxygen, you know,
[11:49.850 --> 11:52.170]  it's just, it's a different game altogether.
[11:52.170 --> 11:53.250]  Oh, totally.
[11:53.250 --> 11:55.490]  Your fungal resistance, it'd have to be on point
[11:55.490 --> 11:58.130]  because you're not having any issues at that.
[11:58.130 --> 12:00.330]  Your finishing time has to be dialed,
[12:01.290 --> 12:06.290]  but the fungal pressure is almost non-existent at that height.
[12:07.090 --> 12:09.290]  And so I think that when you drop back down,
[12:09.290 --> 12:11.650]  it's that you have to make a new selection
[12:11.650 --> 12:12.850]  from the product.
[12:12.850 --> 12:14.290]  That's what's so cool about, you know,
[12:14.290 --> 12:15.570]  global cannabis right now,
[12:15.570 --> 12:17.010]  where we're able to meet and talk to people
[12:17.010 --> 12:18.730]  from around the earth so freely,
[12:19.650 --> 12:24.650]  where you can see the expressions of varieties
[12:24.810 --> 12:26.010]  in different ranges.
[12:26.010 --> 12:28.770]  Because like, say like for me here at my house, right?
[12:28.770 --> 12:29.970]  And I've done it before.
[12:29.970 --> 12:32.570]  My house, my altitude of my house is like 500,
[12:32.570 --> 12:35.450]  but I'm up at like 2000 at the farm.
[12:35.450 --> 12:39.050]  But searing sun and heavy wind,
[12:39.050 --> 12:43.850]  the exact same soil mix, same cultivator,
[12:43.850 --> 12:47.330]  same size, you know, planting size,
[12:47.330 --> 12:50.250]  same start, same time, everything identical,
[12:50.250 --> 12:52.370]  all variables held constant.
[12:52.370 --> 12:54.930]  I get twice the size plant in my yard.
[12:56.650 --> 12:58.690]  Double, double the size.
[12:58.690 --> 13:01.450]  And Elaine and I talked about this
[13:01.450 --> 13:03.170]  and Joel was talking about this yesterday.
[13:03.170 --> 13:05.090]  I did, and after I talked with Elaine about it,
[13:05.090 --> 13:07.290]  in the shade, growing in the shade,
[13:07.290 --> 13:11.290]  it's under canopy plant, cannabis is, right?
[13:11.290 --> 13:13.290]  In succession, that's why we were talking about it.
[13:13.290 --> 13:14.650]  And so I have to talk about,
[13:14.650 --> 13:17.930]  I put a bunch of plants in my tree line over here
[13:17.930 --> 13:20.370]  and I did, you know, kind of in depths in same plant,
[13:20.370 --> 13:23.410]  a bunch of cuts, and I found an area that was just,
[13:23.410 --> 13:27.090]  and it's all about the way I see
[13:27.090 --> 13:29.650]  the actual plant material developing.
[13:29.650 --> 13:31.050]  You know, I'm sure it definitely affects
[13:31.050 --> 13:32.410]  the trichomes and everything else,
[13:32.410 --> 13:36.450]  but what I see in the plant material is like a very leather,
[13:36.450 --> 13:40.570]  you know, not coarse, but a very leathery soft,
[13:40.570 --> 13:43.090]  you're just like, God, I want to put it on my cheek,
[13:43.090 --> 13:46.290]  it is thicker, and it almost looks like a succulent,
[13:46.290 --> 13:47.850]  you know, you're just like, oh, it's soft.
[13:47.850 --> 13:48.690]  Yeah, yeah.
[13:50.290 --> 13:53.090]  So interestingly, in the last conversation,
[13:53.770 --> 13:54.890]  there was a question we didn't get to,
[13:54.890 --> 13:56.930]  but it was from a guy named Sawyer Stewart,
[13:56.930 --> 13:58.610]  who said, is it possible to breed
[13:58.610 --> 14:01.690]  for partial sun slash shady areas?
[14:01.690 --> 14:02.530]  Great.
[14:02.530 --> 14:03.930]  Oh, hell yeah.
[14:03.930 --> 14:05.450]  You almost have to.
[14:05.450 --> 14:08.370]  Me and Gondra, you know, Rebel Dan,
[14:08.370 --> 14:09.970]  had that discussion years ago,
[14:09.970 --> 14:11.930]  because he was doing such beautiful work
[14:11.930 --> 14:15.050]  out in Palo Verde on his OG lines.
[14:15.050 --> 14:16.890]  And I said to him, I said, what you need to do is,
[14:16.890 --> 14:21.010]  I said, you need to go and create an OG sour line
[14:21.010 --> 14:23.410]  that is less than the optimal conditions
[14:23.410 --> 14:25.250]  that you're working with.
[14:25.250 --> 14:26.650]  And he was like, why is that?
[14:26.650 --> 14:28.650]  You know, and I said, because the majority of people
[14:28.650 --> 14:30.410]  don't have what you have.
[14:30.410 --> 14:32.770]  They don't have that incredible exposure.
[14:32.770 --> 14:36.570]  And what I found is that it's stuff like the Hindus,
[14:36.570 --> 14:38.330]  which is really, to me, what kind of cookie
[14:38.330 --> 14:42.530]  really represents, I don't see OG in cookie.
[14:42.530 --> 14:45.010]  When you breed it, I don't see OG popping out of it.
[14:45.010 --> 14:46.890]  Like, I know it's supposed to be this or that,
[14:46.890 --> 14:49.330]  but what I see is more of a Hindu morphology.
[14:50.170 --> 14:52.330]  Those do really well in the shade,
[14:52.330 --> 14:56.850]  but any of the gas strains don't seem to shine as much.
[14:56.850 --> 14:58.530]  They want that intensity.
[14:58.530 --> 15:01.250]  They don't get, they don't tighten up the same way.
[15:01.250 --> 15:04.530]  Whereas all the cookie hybrids I play with,
[15:04.530 --> 15:07.890]  they do well in that, you know, four hours,
[15:07.890 --> 15:11.130]  five hours of good sun, but filtered in the morning,
[15:11.130 --> 15:13.850]  filtered in the evening.
[15:13.850 --> 15:17.490]  So way more applicable for most people.
[15:17.570 --> 15:21.050]  And for a lot of people too, you know, like,
[15:21.050 --> 15:24.050]  we're lucky we can grow and not have any problems.
[15:24.050 --> 15:26.290]  I don't have any theft at my yard.
[15:26.290 --> 15:27.810]  All my neighbors are cultivators too.
[15:27.810 --> 15:29.970]  Nobody's gonna jump over my fence and steal my grass.
[15:29.970 --> 15:32.170]  They got their own crop.
[15:32.170 --> 15:35.170]  So I don't have to worry about hiding herb.
[15:35.170 --> 15:37.410]  And, you know, with the California situation,
[15:37.410 --> 15:41.290]  I got a 215 still, so I can do my 215 med crop,
[15:41.290 --> 15:44.010]  and I can do my Cali legal six,
[15:44.010 --> 15:45.290]  which means that in my house,
[15:45.290 --> 15:49.410]  I can do a fairly large amount of cannabis if I choose to.
[15:49.410 --> 15:52.970]  But that's not the majority of people who wanna cultivate.
[15:52.970 --> 15:54.690]  And I think just like some of this stuff that you,
[15:54.690 --> 15:56.570]  that's why your selection is so interesting to me
[15:56.570 --> 15:58.890]  all the time, because your conditions
[15:58.890 --> 16:01.610]  where you are is so moist.
[16:01.610 --> 16:05.810]  And if you can pull it off and it shines,
[16:05.810 --> 16:08.050]  that's a killer variety for anyone
[16:08.050 --> 16:09.970]  who has any type of fungal propensity.
[16:11.330 --> 16:13.010]  That was also, just quickly,
[16:13.010 --> 16:14.930]  that was also one of the other questions
[16:15.570 --> 16:17.290]  in the last conversation we didn't get to
[16:17.290 --> 16:22.290]  is from a guy in Mexico who is dealing with fusarium.
[16:26.130 --> 16:29.170]  Fusarium, fusarium is kind of weird here.
[16:29.170 --> 16:31.450]  It moves in cycles.
[16:31.450 --> 16:34.770]  And so what I noticed is that fungal pressure,
[16:34.770 --> 16:36.290]  and what's up, Big Nick?
[16:36.290 --> 16:37.770]  What's up, man?
[16:37.770 --> 16:40.330]  I'm just letting you guys chop it up right now.
[16:42.610 --> 16:44.770]  I was gonna comment on your beautiful hair.
[16:45.610 --> 16:47.370]  Oh, thank you, man, I got it rocking.
[16:47.370 --> 16:49.570]  You long hairs, man, you guys.
[16:50.850 --> 16:55.770]  And so the fusarium, we noticed it moves in waves
[16:55.770 --> 16:58.370]  where we go back like seven years
[16:58.370 --> 17:03.370]  and fusarium was just tearing through Humboldt County.
[17:03.890 --> 17:06.290]  And I was going out and looking at operations
[17:06.290 --> 17:08.650]  for troubleshooting, and I went to one of them
[17:08.650 --> 17:11.730]  and they were losing one plant a day.
[17:11.730 --> 17:13.330]  But every plant that they were losing
[17:13.330 --> 17:15.890]  was probably like 11 pounds.
[17:15.890 --> 17:20.530]  So, and at that time, the value was still up in the money.
[17:20.530 --> 17:21.890]  So you would drop and they were losing
[17:21.890 --> 17:24.730]  like 30,000 a day per plant.
[17:24.730 --> 17:28.210]  And it had just, and that's when we,
[17:28.210 --> 17:30.970]  they say that fusarium is soil-borne
[17:30.970 --> 17:34.370]  and it has to have a vector transmission to make it move.
[17:34.370 --> 17:36.290]  But when I would go look at these operations
[17:36.290 --> 17:38.130]  and get up on upper plain,
[17:38.130 --> 17:40.490]  I could see the swath of damage
[17:40.490 --> 17:42.810]  that followed the wind movement too.
[17:43.290 --> 17:44.450]  So it was almost like the fusarium
[17:44.450 --> 17:47.530]  had connected to soil particles.
[17:47.530 --> 17:51.490]  And then as that became atomized, it moved through
[17:51.490 --> 17:55.570]  and you could see where the air had moved and hit it.
[17:55.570 --> 17:58.490]  And then I had it at one of my operations.
[17:58.490 --> 18:01.890]  And what I did was I just changed cultivars
[18:01.890 --> 18:04.570]  because we seemed to notice that the green crack,
[18:04.570 --> 18:05.810]  which was popular at the time
[18:05.810 --> 18:07.570]  and we were running the hell out of it,
[18:07.570 --> 18:10.250]  it had suddenly become highly prone to it.
[18:10.250 --> 18:12.050]  And when I replaced that cultivar,
[18:12.090 --> 18:13.250]  I didn't replace anything else,
[18:13.250 --> 18:17.050]  changed nothing but the plant, everything fine.
[18:18.570 --> 18:21.650]  And so I think that with fusarium,
[18:21.650 --> 18:26.450]  if you have the ability to have a laboratory
[18:26.450 --> 18:31.210]  give you a culture that you could inoculate the plant with,
[18:31.210 --> 18:34.250]  you'd be able to utilize that in your breeding projects
[18:34.250 --> 18:35.610]  so that you'd be able to find the ones
[18:35.610 --> 18:39.290]  that have the least propensity to fusarium.
[18:39.290 --> 18:42.010]  Same thing with russet, same thing with aphid.
[18:42.850 --> 18:46.370]  It's something is an outlier.
[18:46.370 --> 18:48.250]  There's always something that's gonna live.
[18:48.250 --> 18:49.650]  You could always just get your ass kicked
[18:49.650 --> 18:52.450]  for a number of years and then you got the whole gamut.
[18:52.450 --> 18:56.730]  Yeah, the year 90, 2011 when I had the russets.
[18:56.730 --> 18:57.730]  Yeah, yeah.
[18:57.730 --> 18:59.210]  And the russets backed up here.
[18:59.210 --> 19:01.890]  What we're seeing a lot like up in where Dan is,
[19:01.890 --> 19:04.130]  he's up in a place called Palo Verde
[19:04.130 --> 19:05.490]  and that's gorgeous, right?
[19:05.490 --> 19:07.250]  But I got a bunch of buddies up there
[19:07.250 --> 19:09.210]  that are getting a lot of leaf hopper.
[19:09.210 --> 19:10.850]  And so the leaf hopper up there
[19:11.090 --> 19:14.570]  and they have a weird effect on the plant
[19:14.570 --> 19:16.490]  in the same way that russet mites do
[19:16.490 --> 19:19.170]  where they almost have a toxic reaction
[19:19.170 --> 19:21.890]  to the plant's chemistry when they feed.
[19:21.890 --> 19:24.530]  And it makes the plant do the craziest looking shit
[19:24.530 --> 19:26.210]  with the leaves, almost like fasciitis
[19:26.210 --> 19:31.210]  where the stem thins out and opens up, trippy.
[19:31.810 --> 19:32.650]  So-
[19:32.650 --> 19:35.170]  It leaves holes in the leaf with those leaf hoppers.
[19:35.170 --> 19:36.010]  We've dealt with that.
[19:36.010 --> 19:37.970]  Yeah, yeah, they chew them up
[19:37.970 --> 19:40.130]  and then they toxify the plant.
[19:40.170 --> 19:43.450]  It looks more damaged than big ass Japanese beetles
[19:43.450 --> 19:44.930]  or anything that could get on them.
[19:44.930 --> 19:48.090]  Those little big leaf hoppers put holes in the leaves.
[19:48.090 --> 19:48.930]  It's amazing.
[19:48.930 --> 19:50.730]  Yeah, I'd like to see one under a microscope.
[19:50.730 --> 19:53.290]  I should, next time I go up to hell
[19:53.290 --> 19:55.730]  and I go to a friend's op, I'll put one in a jar.
[19:55.730 --> 19:58.370]  And I don't have a full mic
[19:58.370 --> 20:00.250]  but I have a really nice digital mic
[20:00.250 --> 20:02.490]  that plugs into my phone that,
[20:03.450 --> 20:05.490]  what's the name of that motherfucker?
[20:05.490 --> 20:06.570]  Oh, the Dynalite.
[20:06.570 --> 20:07.610]  I got it right here next to me.
[20:07.610 --> 20:08.890]  I got a nice Dynalite, man.
[20:08.890 --> 20:10.730]  That thing is a good mic.
[20:10.730 --> 20:12.610]  And it just plugs into your iPad.
[20:12.610 --> 20:14.730]  I actually have it on a Bluetooth
[20:14.730 --> 20:16.610]  so that I don't have to plug it into the phone
[20:16.610 --> 20:18.570]  so I can have someone else hold the phone
[20:18.570 --> 20:20.810]  while I'm crawling into bed.
[20:20.810 --> 20:24.450]  And then I can look around and I'm like, what do we see?
[20:24.450 --> 20:25.970]  And we've seen a lot of that.
[20:25.970 --> 20:28.490]  And then I don't see the aphids on the outdoor
[20:28.490 --> 20:30.370]  because natural predation slows it.
[20:30.370 --> 20:31.770]  But I'm telling you,
[20:31.770 --> 20:35.610]  California is basically an aphid factory right now.
[20:35.650 --> 20:40.570]  You got indoors or you got, you know, Venlo ops, holy shit.
[20:40.570 --> 20:41.770]  I go into these places
[20:41.770 --> 20:44.170]  and man, these fucking things are everywhere.
[20:45.290 --> 20:46.890]  Michigan's an aphid factory.
[20:46.890 --> 20:51.890]  I took a picture of this guy the other day.
[20:54.250 --> 20:56.010]  Yeah, that's what's hitting my plants up
[20:56.010 --> 20:57.290]  harder than anything this year.
[20:57.290 --> 20:59.930]  That and the aphids in Michigan.
[20:59.930 --> 21:02.250]  And coming out of Kentucky cultivating there,
[21:02.250 --> 21:04.330]  I dealt more with spider mites and russets.
[21:04.370 --> 21:07.890]  So this is a, the aphid in our woods,
[21:07.890 --> 21:09.810]  it's covered on the poison ivy.
[21:09.810 --> 21:12.050]  And what's that other thing called Shannon?
[21:12.050 --> 21:13.170]  Virginia creeper.
[21:13.170 --> 21:14.010]  Yeah, Mac.
[21:15.570 --> 21:18.050]  I'm seeing aphids all over Virginia creeper,
[21:18.050 --> 21:19.210]  all over the woods.
[21:19.210 --> 21:21.810]  And then it just kind of comes out and hits the plants.
[21:21.810 --> 21:26.250]  So I've been hitting the Virginia creeper with IPM stuff.
[21:26.250 --> 21:29.130]  And it's really kept it down.
[21:29.130 --> 21:32.250]  The turkeys and chickens have done a hell of a job on that
[21:32.250 --> 21:33.090]  in the cover crop.
[21:33.090 --> 21:35.330]  But we've dealt more with leaf hopper
[21:35.330 --> 21:38.250]  and with aphid here in Michigan than any other pest.
[21:39.290 --> 21:44.010]  Yeah, some people are having some like small locust problems
[21:44.010 --> 21:46.250]  but I'm lucky on that one where whenever I get them
[21:46.250 --> 21:48.810]  to come into my outdoor,
[21:48.810 --> 21:52.370]  I have such a diverse forest around me
[21:52.370 --> 21:53.970]  that if I come out early in the morning,
[21:53.970 --> 21:57.210]  I can watch all the little birds fly through the crop
[21:57.210 --> 21:59.290]  and just clean these things off.
[21:59.290 --> 22:01.610]  I mean, they knock the shit out of them.
[22:01.610 --> 22:04.330]  But it's in cycles.
[22:04.330 --> 22:08.050]  So you'll see this problem, just like the fusarium issue.
[22:08.050 --> 22:09.370]  We had it everywhere.
[22:09.370 --> 22:11.530]  I was looking at crops all over the place
[22:11.530 --> 22:14.130]  and they weren't connected crops,
[22:14.130 --> 22:17.250]  meaning the operators weren't the vector moving it
[22:17.250 --> 22:18.610]  from scene to scene.
[22:18.610 --> 22:21.370]  They weren't getting the plants from the same location.
[22:21.370 --> 22:23.330]  They weren't getting the dirt from the same location.
[22:23.330 --> 22:27.610]  So you've seen this huge widespread issue.
[22:27.650 --> 22:32.650]  And then Russets, Broad Mites were probably 210, 211
[22:33.610 --> 22:36.090]  was the Broad Mite had come out.
[22:36.090 --> 22:39.530]  And then we go into the Russet and we go in a fusarium.
[22:39.530 --> 22:41.690]  And then those are all kind of backed up.
[22:41.690 --> 22:43.890]  And then now we're into the hoppers
[22:43.890 --> 22:45.610]  and now we're into the aphid.
[22:45.610 --> 22:48.970]  And so, it's this never ending cycle.
[22:48.970 --> 22:50.930]  And ultimately what you do is,
[22:50.930 --> 22:54.570]  you just, you see what survives it and you catalog it.
[22:54.570 --> 22:56.770]  And that way you know that these plants work
[22:56.770 --> 23:00.970]  in these situations and they'll give you some insurance.
[23:00.970 --> 23:04.490]  I call it like the money plants, the ones that can resist.
[23:04.490 --> 23:07.770]  Just like that one that I was just talking about with Josh,
[23:07.770 --> 23:12.050]  where he's got that Magnum Opus to the Testarosa.
[23:12.050 --> 23:16.930]  So really it's like 75% Royal lines into a Skittle.
[23:17.810 --> 23:21.590]  And the Skittle imparts some really killer flavor profiles,
[23:21.590 --> 23:24.210]  but she's fucking worthless outside as a cultivator.
[23:24.210 --> 23:25.050]  You know what I mean?
[23:25.050 --> 23:26.810]  It just is terrible to grow it outdoor.
[23:26.810 --> 23:28.210]  If it gets any moisture on it,
[23:28.210 --> 23:30.650]  it basically wants to disintegrate.
[23:30.650 --> 23:33.090]  But it brings a really richness to it.
[23:33.090 --> 23:35.130]  And that plant, if he can grow that up
[23:35.130 --> 23:37.470]  in coastal Washington, you're killing it.
[23:38.330 --> 23:40.330]  Yeah, I had two of them come through.
[23:40.330 --> 23:42.330]  Gwyn, I had one on the Limevine
[23:42.330 --> 23:44.970]  and one on the Black Lime Reserve come through
[23:44.970 --> 23:47.070]  in last year, which was a real bad year.
[23:47.070 --> 23:48.050]  Really, really bad.
[23:48.050 --> 23:49.850]  I mean, that's all I had harvested.
[23:49.850 --> 23:50.690]  That's right.
[23:50.690 --> 23:52.530]  It was that BLR that you laid it into too.
[23:52.530 --> 23:53.850]  Yep. Yep.
[23:53.850 --> 23:55.690]  And there's a lot there.
[23:55.690 --> 23:59.050]  It's got the full, I call it the Royal,
[23:59.050 --> 24:01.730]  kind of Royal flavor profile that I've seen
[24:01.730 --> 24:03.890]  in the stuff, seed stock that I've kind of run through
[24:03.890 --> 24:05.510]  that has Royal in it.
[24:05.510 --> 24:07.730]  It's got the whole full flavor profile,
[24:07.730 --> 24:11.130]  but then it has this one specific thing where it,
[24:11.130 --> 24:11.970]  and I think it's good.
[24:11.970 --> 24:13.370]  It gets it from the Black Lime Reserve,
[24:13.370 --> 24:15.810]  you know, it gets that gas to it.
[24:15.810 --> 24:20.530]  Yeah, that chemo thing going in it.
[24:20.530 --> 24:22.770]  And then it has the Skittles in there,
[24:22.770 --> 24:24.130]  just a little bit.
[24:24.130 --> 24:25.970]  You want it just, cause it's so strong,
[24:25.970 --> 24:26.810]  just a hint of it.
[24:26.810 --> 24:28.090]  Yeah, you just need a touch.
[24:28.090 --> 24:28.930]  Yeah.
[24:28.930 --> 24:31.130]  But you know, and then that's the quarter
[24:31.130 --> 24:31.970]  that I'm talking about.
[24:31.970 --> 24:33.530]  So then I'm like looking at the quarter going
[24:33.530 --> 24:35.450]  a little more Skittles, a little more Lime,
[24:35.450 --> 24:37.530]  a little more just chem dog.
[24:37.530 --> 24:40.690]  And it's really cool to see and just kind of decide
[24:40.690 --> 24:41.650]  where I'm going to settle on it.
[24:41.650 --> 24:42.490]  You know, I probably end,
[24:42.490 --> 24:44.370]  we'll end up with two or three that lean that,
[24:44.370 --> 24:46.090]  lean that certain direction.
[24:46.090 --> 24:46.930]  Mm-hmm.
[24:46.930 --> 24:49.530]  I always, you know, the thing is I love,
[24:49.530 --> 24:53.490]  I love diversity, but I'm a fuel smoker primarily.
[24:54.330 --> 24:58.810]  So I like, I like, I like a splash of flavor in the gas,
[24:58.810 --> 25:02.090]  but push come to shove, all gas is good with me.
[25:02.090 --> 25:03.370]  Yeah, yeah, me too.
[25:03.370 --> 25:06.490]  And so Nick, so Nick had the same seeds
[25:06.490 --> 25:07.970]  and you, I don't know how many you popped,
[25:07.970 --> 25:11.010]  but you found the super strong orange phenol
[25:11.010 --> 25:11.850]  as you're calling it.
[25:11.850 --> 25:13.370]  That's the Skittles leaner.
[25:13.370 --> 25:16.130]  And there's a range of Skittles flavor too, you know.
[25:16.130 --> 25:19.010]  The orange phenol I have out of that is the,
[25:19.530 --> 25:23.130]  I mean, it's more orange than any Cali O, any Tangy.
[25:23.130 --> 25:25.290]  It is the orangest phenol I've ever smoked.
[25:25.290 --> 25:27.770]  I've got it outdoors right by a pure kush
[25:27.770 --> 25:30.330]  in that one bed I sent you a picture of earlier, Josh.
[25:30.330 --> 25:31.850]  That would be a good price.
[25:31.850 --> 25:34.610]  It's just fucking exploded.
[25:35.490 --> 25:37.690]  But it is so orange that, I mean,
[25:37.690 --> 25:40.650]  you could almost use this as a potpourri in your house.
[25:40.650 --> 25:43.330]  You could ship this right in the mail to somebody
[25:43.330 --> 25:45.490]  and it would go past drug dogs
[25:45.490 --> 25:48.930]  because it has no marijuana profile whatsoever to it.
[25:49.810 --> 25:53.170]  It is like open citrus, maybe even more mango than orange.
[25:54.410 --> 25:57.410]  And it's not even my flavor profile.
[25:57.410 --> 26:00.930]  I'm stupid on the gas and chemical profiles right now.
[26:00.930 --> 26:03.250]  And a little bit of cheese is what I keep going to
[26:03.250 --> 26:05.090]  as far as personal smoke.
[26:05.090 --> 26:08.250]  But it is so orange that I just couldn't let it go.
[26:08.250 --> 26:10.970]  I mean, it's just overly orange.
[26:10.970 --> 26:13.450]  It's almost offensively orange.
[26:13.450 --> 26:15.650]  I got that tangerine skunk
[26:15.650 --> 26:18.810]  that's really like the progenitor to the Cali O.
[26:19.690 --> 26:21.010]  It comes before it.
[26:21.010 --> 26:24.450]  And when you DNA it, you can see,
[26:24.450 --> 26:27.170]  you don't know when you DNA the plant,
[26:27.170 --> 26:29.930]  you don't know what parent it is,
[26:29.930 --> 26:32.930]  but you know that it's a parent or a progeny.
[26:32.930 --> 26:37.890]  So you can tell if you take the plants and look at them,
[26:37.890 --> 26:40.810]  you can tell which one came from the other,
[26:40.810 --> 26:44.250]  but you don't know what side it was that produced it.
[26:44.250 --> 26:48.050]  But that tangerine skunk, it's old,
[26:48.050 --> 26:50.290]  but that thing has just it's sick,
[26:50.290 --> 26:52.770]  sick citrus flavor to it.
[26:52.770 --> 26:53.810]  And I like it.
[26:53.810 --> 26:56.730]  I mean, it's gorgeous for what you use it for,
[26:56.730 --> 27:00.650]  but I can't smoke too much citrus herb consistently.
[27:00.650 --> 27:01.490]  No.
[27:03.250 --> 27:05.210]  You know what's nice is it's nice when you're burning
[27:05.210 --> 27:08.050]  with people who are lighter smokers,
[27:09.130 --> 27:11.450]  and we're looking to basically get crucified.
[27:11.450 --> 27:12.290]  You know what I mean?
[27:12.290 --> 27:13.130]  I want this to be-
[27:13.130 --> 27:14.690]  You can show them a flavor profile
[27:14.690 --> 27:17.130]  where most people are just used to like weed
[27:17.130 --> 27:20.730]  being like this dirty thing that they smell at a concert.
[27:20.730 --> 27:23.730]  You know, this coming out of, yeah.
[27:23.730 --> 27:25.130]  Almost that mold smell.
[27:25.130 --> 27:25.970]  That's that old,
[27:25.970 --> 27:29.410]  that old brick weed, that light mold smell
[27:29.410 --> 27:32.170]  that people identify marijuana to.
[27:32.170 --> 27:35.730]  It's even that secondary smoke profile
[27:35.730 --> 27:38.370]  that everybody goes back to that roadkill skunk smell
[27:38.370 --> 27:39.210]  all the time.
[27:39.210 --> 27:40.090]  And that's what they identify
[27:40.090 --> 27:42.050]  when they first started smoking.
[27:42.050 --> 27:43.730]  I'm more thinking,
[27:43.730 --> 27:46.210]  I haven't seen roadkill skunk in forever.
[27:46.210 --> 27:48.010]  I don't even know if it exists anymore,
[27:48.010 --> 27:51.650]  but I believe that that burning marijuana smell
[27:51.650 --> 27:54.450]  from all that mold gives that skunky smell.
[27:54.450 --> 27:56.450]  And that's that first smell you smell
[27:56.450 --> 27:57.810]  when you get introduced to marijuana,
[27:57.810 --> 27:59.130]  and it sticks with you.
[27:59.130 --> 28:03.290]  It is a, it is the biggest thing that you go back to,
[28:03.290 --> 28:05.170]  like smell affects memory,
[28:05.170 --> 28:07.050]  and it goes back into,
[28:07.050 --> 28:09.210]  you never really experienced that smell before
[28:09.210 --> 28:11.410]  outside of a skunk aroma.
[28:11.410 --> 28:13.090]  So that was the first thing people put it to.
[28:13.090 --> 28:14.410]  Ah, that skunk weed.
[28:14.410 --> 28:17.530]  But a lot of times that skunk weed
[28:17.530 --> 28:19.250]  wasn't really skunk weed.
[28:19.250 --> 28:22.210]  It was more of a pissy ammonia mold smell.
[28:22.210 --> 28:23.050]  Composition.
[28:23.050 --> 28:23.890]  The real skunk,
[28:24.930 --> 28:28.210]  the real skunk was real skunk.
[28:28.210 --> 28:29.050]  It's just that-
[28:29.050 --> 28:30.410]  Yeah, but I just haven't seen it in forever.
[28:30.410 --> 28:31.250]  No, no.
[28:31.250 --> 28:33.210]  And we were digging through a pile of it,
[28:33.210 --> 28:34.810]  trying to get what we really wanted.
[28:34.810 --> 28:38.730]  Cause the problem was that I used to grow it.
[28:38.730 --> 28:41.570]  And, and the problem is that I actually had
[28:41.570 --> 28:44.610]  a really nice selection that gave me
[28:44.610 --> 28:48.850]  the cultivar I wanted with that scent
[28:48.850 --> 28:51.010]  and cannabinoid profile, you know,
[28:51.010 --> 28:53.170]  crippling high, but killer body.
[28:53.170 --> 28:55.370]  The plant itself grew well.
[28:55.370 --> 28:56.970]  And I think it was probably one of the best plants
[28:56.970 --> 28:58.810]  I've ever had in my life.
[28:58.810 --> 29:02.090]  That there was a dude that I rolled with
[29:02.090 --> 29:06.850]  and his buddy's dad was the head of the drug task force.
[29:06.850 --> 29:09.770]  And the guy had been raiding dope forever.
[29:09.770 --> 29:14.090]  And he brought his son a copy of this plant and said,
[29:14.090 --> 29:17.410]  this is the best herb we've ever raided.
[29:17.410 --> 29:20.210]  And he brought him a fucking clone.
[29:20.210 --> 29:22.210]  And I got that copy, right?
[29:22.210 --> 29:23.410]  And it was unreal.
[29:23.410 --> 29:26.330]  And it was so strong that I got booted out
[29:26.330 --> 29:28.130]  of a fucking football game at the rate
[29:28.130 --> 29:30.570]  as we opened up the car door in the parking lot,
[29:30.570 --> 29:32.410]  the smell poured out.
[29:32.410 --> 29:35.930]  People in the parking lot was screaming, what is that?
[29:35.930 --> 29:37.890]  It brought attention to 5-0.
[29:37.890 --> 29:42.890]  5-0 runs to the car, grabs me and me, yokes us the fuck up.
[29:43.890 --> 29:47.130]  And we get dragged out of the fucking stadium.
[29:47.130 --> 29:48.250]  And I'm talking like, you know,
[29:48.250 --> 29:50.890]  you just opened the car door and that shit moved
[29:50.890 --> 29:51.970]  hundreds of feet.
[29:51.970 --> 29:54.210]  It was so volatile.
[29:54.210 --> 29:55.930]  And the saddest part of that story
[29:55.930 --> 29:57.850]  is you missed the game, right?
[29:57.850 --> 29:59.490]  We did, we missed the game.
[29:59.490 --> 30:01.690]  And I was furious mostly just because
[30:01.690 --> 30:03.650]  they stole the fucking ounce I had in the car.
[30:03.650 --> 30:04.810]  I was gonna say the bag.
[30:04.810 --> 30:05.650]  They took the bag.
[30:05.650 --> 30:06.490]  They took the bag of grass.
[30:06.490 --> 30:07.570]  Cause I had season tickets.
[30:08.130 --> 30:10.690]  I had front row seats to the Raiders, right?
[30:10.690 --> 30:12.410]  For 20 fucking years.
[30:12.410 --> 30:14.930]  So me and my buddy, Azell,
[30:14.930 --> 30:17.610]  had four front row seats on the 30.
[30:17.610 --> 30:20.890]  So we were front row at the Raiders for 20 years, right?
[30:20.890 --> 30:22.490]  So I went to a hundred fucking games.
[30:22.490 --> 30:26.690]  So a game isn't a big deal as much as you stole my grass.
[30:27.970 --> 30:30.050]  And then we had to drive all the way back to Humboldt
[30:30.050 --> 30:31.290]  with no fucking herb, right?
[30:31.290 --> 30:32.250]  Me and Peele laughing.
[30:32.250 --> 30:34.170]  We're like, you gotta be kidding me.
[30:34.170 --> 30:35.010]  Like.
[30:36.010 --> 30:37.650]  The saddest part of that story, Peter,
[30:37.650 --> 30:39.090]  is he doesn't have that cut anymore.
[30:39.090 --> 30:39.930]  That's the saddest part of that story.
[30:39.930 --> 30:42.770]  No, I lost it in a fucking raid.
[30:42.770 --> 30:46.770]  These pricks, they were chasing me for a long time
[30:46.770 --> 30:48.410]  and they couldn't get me.
[30:48.410 --> 30:51.610]  And they thought that my house was loaded and it wasn't.
[30:51.610 --> 30:52.450]  And I mean, I'm like,
[30:52.450 --> 30:54.250]  you'd think they were doing an electrical assessment
[30:54.250 --> 30:56.570]  cause it wasn't any juice running through the crib.
[30:56.570 --> 31:01.370]  And all I had was a small little 215 smoke scene
[31:01.370 --> 31:02.970]  and the fucking mothers.
[31:03.970 --> 31:07.130]  And when they raided me, they chopped my shit.
[31:07.130 --> 31:12.130]  And, you know, I always think back
[31:12.210 --> 31:13.450]  because they took some stuff
[31:13.450 --> 31:15.450]  that I'd never been able to find or replace.
[31:15.450 --> 31:19.330]  It took me almost like, I would say two years.
[31:19.330 --> 31:21.450]  So that would have been like 202.
[31:21.450 --> 31:24.690]  So 201, 202, I get whacked.
[31:24.690 --> 31:27.890]  It was like two years before I collected anything again
[31:27.890 --> 31:29.930]  because I was emotionally like beat up
[31:30.250 --> 31:32.890]  from losing the best shit that I had.
[31:32.890 --> 31:35.690]  Like the library I had at that moment,
[31:35.690 --> 31:39.010]  I'd put against anybody's library ever.
[31:39.010 --> 31:42.890]  It was, I was, man, I was touching all these old dudes.
[31:42.890 --> 31:45.290]  I was touching all these people
[31:45.290 --> 31:50.290]  that had all this exotic rare shit from the day
[31:50.410 --> 31:52.170]  and all that went away.
[31:52.170 --> 31:55.290]  And it was so devastating emotionally
[31:55.290 --> 31:58.250]  that I couldn't reconnect to being a collector.
[31:58.250 --> 32:02.650]  I would just grab stock and produce it at bulk
[32:02.650 --> 32:05.570]  but I no longer went and started really looking
[32:05.570 --> 32:10.570]  for specific things to round out the collection
[32:11.210 --> 32:12.690]  because I always wanted to have things
[32:12.690 --> 32:16.090]  that covered the spectrum of things I like
[32:16.090 --> 32:19.010]  and then the spectrum of workability
[32:19.010 --> 32:21.650]  where some things just work well in certain environments.
[32:21.650 --> 32:24.610]  And at that time I was running operations
[32:24.610 --> 32:25.530]  all over the place.
[32:25.530 --> 32:28.130]  And so if I had any kind of weird situation
[32:28.970 --> 32:29.810]  I had the right plant.
[32:29.810 --> 32:32.330]  I had plants that went left and right more than up.
[32:32.330 --> 32:34.010]  I had plants that finished early.
[32:34.010 --> 32:35.610]  I had plants that needed low light.
[32:35.610 --> 32:38.010]  I had plants that had all the right.
[32:42.410 --> 32:43.250]  They got me, man.
[32:43.250 --> 32:44.210]  That was a hard one.
[32:49.890 --> 32:50.730]  I was talking-
[32:50.730 --> 32:51.650]  Hey, I got a question for you.
[32:51.650 --> 32:53.090]  I got you on here too.
[32:54.450 --> 32:57.050]  Just quickly, Josh, check out the,
[32:57.050 --> 33:02.050]  I sent you in our little chat, take a look at that.
[33:02.530 --> 33:07.530]  That's what Dan and Jackson are donating.
[33:07.610 --> 33:09.850]  Anyway, go ahead, Nick.
[33:09.850 --> 33:11.850]  All right, so in dogs,
[33:11.850 --> 33:13.930]  me and Josh have talked about this a couple of times.
[33:13.930 --> 33:16.690]  I've got a real rosé cut from Emerald Mountain.
[33:16.690 --> 33:19.610]  It was roll cush to Skittles to roll cush,
[33:19.610 --> 33:21.610]  roll seven to Skittles to roll eight.
[33:22.730 --> 33:24.490]  That I grew outdoors last year
[33:24.490 --> 33:27.370]  just a stupid purpley candied out plant.
[33:29.050 --> 33:29.890]  You talk to that-
[33:29.890 --> 33:31.330]  And Josh has that testa rosa,
[33:32.290 --> 33:34.890]  which is Skittles roll cush Skittles.
[33:34.890 --> 33:36.750]  In dogs, if I bred something like that,
[33:36.750 --> 33:39.810]  where it's roll cush, Skittles roll cush on one cultivar,
[33:39.810 --> 33:41.250]  and then Skittles roll cush,
[33:41.250 --> 33:42.770]  Skittles on the other cultivar.
[33:42.770 --> 33:45.610]  In dogs, that'd be a three, two, three line breed.
[33:45.610 --> 33:47.810]  I don't know what the fuck that is in plants,
[33:47.810 --> 33:50.810]  but that really fascinates me to put them two.
[33:50.810 --> 33:52.770]  I'm putting those two together right now,
[33:52.770 --> 33:56.250]  just on the line breeding there, so to speak.
[33:56.250 --> 33:58.630]  I don't know what that's called in plants as much as animals
[33:58.630 --> 34:01.570]  where everything I do based on plants
[34:01.570 --> 34:03.410]  is from German Shepherd breeding.
[34:03.410 --> 34:06.490]  But that line breeding there,
[34:07.490 --> 34:11.850]  where it's two, one on one side and one, two on the other,
[34:11.850 --> 34:13.250]  you think I'll get an equal mix
[34:13.250 --> 34:14.610]  of the Skittles and roll there
[34:14.610 --> 34:16.650]  or will it just be all over the place?
[34:20.780 --> 34:21.900]  You'll have to run it out
[34:21.900 --> 34:25.460]  because you really don't know the predominance in traits
[34:25.460 --> 34:27.440]  in terms of passing.
[34:27.440 --> 34:30.020]  And so you're gonna have to run it.
[34:30.020 --> 34:32.460]  And then once you run it, you'll find out.
[34:32.460 --> 34:35.700]  Because sometimes some plants are so dominant
[34:35.700 --> 34:39.820]  that the black lime reserve
[34:39.820 --> 34:44.140]  that chem that they used in the black lime is dominant.
[34:44.980 --> 34:47.220]  And that chem is so dominant
[34:47.220 --> 34:50.960]  that it can stamp out the line.
[34:50.960 --> 34:55.900]  And so anything that Leo and Ellie use that plant on,
[34:55.900 --> 34:58.140]  it absolutely overpowered it.
[34:59.100 --> 35:00.560]  I understand that because I had to go through
[35:00.560 --> 35:02.920]  a lot of those to find the more lime,
[35:02.920 --> 35:05.960]  lean, you know, that wasn't chem lean.
[35:05.960 --> 35:08.340]  Yeah, that's why Gene doesn't really like that chem dog,
[35:08.340 --> 35:10.920]  even though that's a beautiful chem.
[35:10.920 --> 35:14.900]  And I have the 2012 Emerald Cup winner.
[35:14.900 --> 35:19.600]  So I have the cut that won the Emerald Cup in 2012.
[35:19.600 --> 35:22.760]  And it's a longer flowering outdoor chem,
[35:22.760 --> 35:24.960]  but it has an incredible resistance.
[35:24.960 --> 35:27.820]  So you can take it into, you know, November,
[35:28.740 --> 35:32.780]  past Halloween and get stunning flower formation,
[35:32.780 --> 35:33.720]  but no problem.
[35:33.720 --> 35:35.320]  So, I mean, I love it.
[35:35.320 --> 35:38.580]  But when he's using that in his lines,
[35:38.580 --> 35:41.120]  it kind of takes over his flavor profiles.
[35:41.120 --> 35:44.040]  And Gene wants his profiles to come out
[35:44.040 --> 35:46.240]  because really they're exotic.
[35:47.240 --> 35:50.600]  And so depending on what you're throwing at it
[35:51.560 --> 35:54.360]  and the selection process you go through
[35:54.360 --> 35:57.040]  when you're using it, you'll find outlier clones.
[35:57.040 --> 35:59.600]  But in general, we would say that when that plant
[35:59.600 --> 36:03.820]  is utilized, 85% of the plants that it touches
[36:03.820 --> 36:06.160]  get masked by that heavy gas.
[36:06.160 --> 36:06.980]  Gotcha.
[36:08.040 --> 36:11.640]  In dogs, there was a certain male I used on two breedings.
[36:11.640 --> 36:12.880]  And after the first breeding,
[36:12.880 --> 36:15.680]  I realized he offered nothing to the female,
[36:16.520 --> 36:18.560]  which was awesome because I got all the females'
[36:18.560 --> 36:20.880]  personality and traits and drive
[36:20.880 --> 36:23.600]  and went back to him like that.
[36:23.600 --> 36:24.960]  So that'd be like the opposite.
[36:24.960 --> 36:27.000]  You're saying that the male just throws so much
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.960]  of his shit onto there that the line's
[36:29.960 --> 36:31.360]  harder to shine through.
[36:31.360 --> 36:32.200]  Totally.
[36:32.200 --> 36:34.260]  I'm the breed of male you were just talking about
[36:34.260 --> 36:36.520]  where with my three kids,
[36:36.520 --> 36:40.200]  they really reflect a side of a couple of facial features,
[36:40.200 --> 36:43.480]  like my eyes and a little bit of,
[36:43.480 --> 36:46.080]  a little bit of like morphology.
[36:46.080 --> 36:51.080]  They're really dominant from the mothers.
[36:51.160 --> 36:53.240]  And so I always laugh because I'm the breed of male
[36:53.240 --> 36:55.740]  you use if you wanna have the female shine.
[36:57.320 --> 37:01.400]  Because I don't stamp the traits on top of them.
[37:01.400 --> 37:02.480]  They're dominant.
[37:02.480 --> 37:04.340]  My eye color moves forward.
[37:05.240 --> 37:07.320]  A few little pieces move forward.
[37:07.320 --> 37:09.880]  But other than that, no.
[37:09.880 --> 37:10.720]  And so-
[37:10.720 --> 37:13.280]  I have some dominant genes.
[37:13.880 --> 37:16.080]  My two daughters who are half Chinese
[37:16.080 --> 37:18.480]  look exactly like mini-me's.
[37:18.480 --> 37:19.320]  Oh, that's incredible.
[37:19.320 --> 37:21.640]  I would never have known they were half Chinese.
[37:21.640 --> 37:22.480]  No shit.
[37:22.480 --> 37:24.240]  Green eyes.
[37:24.240 --> 37:26.980]  Yeah, and I've seen your kids playing on the screen.
[37:26.980 --> 37:30.360]  I would never have known they had Asian mom
[37:30.360 --> 37:32.800]  because your gene, what's your,
[37:32.800 --> 37:35.800]  so that's just, are you just heavy Italian both sides?
[37:35.800 --> 37:38.800]  No, my mom's German with an accent.
[37:38.800 --> 37:39.640]  German.
[37:39.640 --> 37:42.560]  So Italian dad, German mom.
[37:42.560 --> 37:43.400]  Interesting.
[37:44.880 --> 37:47.080]  I have the same thing I was telling you, Kev,
[37:47.080 --> 37:48.720]  the other day, I think when we were on air,
[37:48.720 --> 37:51.800]  that I have my son who looks just like me
[37:51.800 --> 37:53.760]  and blonde hair, blue eyes.
[37:53.760 --> 37:55.320]  My dad, blonde hair, blue eyes.
[37:55.320 --> 37:57.140]  My mom, dark hair, Italian.
[37:58.640 --> 38:02.520]  My grandma was born in Italy, dark hair, Italian.
[38:02.520 --> 38:03.360]  I'm the whole side of the family.
[38:03.360 --> 38:04.440]  What's your old man speak?
[38:04.440 --> 38:07.680]  It's all messed up, Scottish, Welsh.
[38:07.680 --> 38:10.400]  But for whatever reason, that blue eyes pushed through
[38:10.400 --> 38:15.400]  on me and my two of the three children he put off.
[38:15.680 --> 38:17.200]  But then with me, it was the same thing.
[38:17.200 --> 38:19.580]  Like I got the same facial structure as him.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.080]  My son is like spitting image of me
[38:23.080 --> 38:25.720]  and between me and my dad with that blonde hair, blue eyes.
[38:25.720 --> 38:27.160]  And then this one in the womb we saw
[38:27.160 --> 38:28.600]  had the same facial structure.
[38:28.600 --> 38:29.440]  Oh, totally, totally.
[38:29.440 --> 38:31.480]  You could see it with the nose and everything.
[38:31.480 --> 38:34.040]  Yeah, and we're just me and my wife are like crazy.
[38:34.040 --> 38:34.880]  You know?
[38:34.880 --> 38:36.200]  You know the sex on it?
[38:36.200 --> 38:37.200]  No, we don't know the sex.
[38:37.200 --> 38:40.280]  We're gonna let it be a surprise, but we'll see.
[38:41.240 --> 38:42.080]  Nice, because it's hard.
[38:42.080 --> 38:42.900]  Sometimes it's easy.
[38:42.900 --> 38:46.000]  My sister, so I'm the oldest and I have a middle sister
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.680]  and the youngest sister looks just like me.
[38:47.680 --> 38:50.960]  You could imagine me with long hair, pale skin.
[38:50.960 --> 38:52.240]  That's her same nose.
[38:52.240 --> 38:54.280]  It's really crazy.
[38:54.280 --> 38:55.400]  Funny, yeah.
[38:55.400 --> 38:57.280]  My brother and I look a little similar.
[38:57.280 --> 38:59.880]  We got different dads, but my mom's dominant.
[38:59.880 --> 39:01.800]  So I don't really look like my pops at all
[39:01.800 --> 39:04.600]  except for body hair profile.
[39:06.240 --> 39:09.600]  I have my dad's Italian body hair.
[39:09.640 --> 39:11.200]  Yeah, I got the fur.
[39:11.200 --> 39:12.520]  I'm coated in fur, man.
[39:12.520 --> 39:14.640]  Back hair, all that shit.
[39:14.640 --> 39:15.480]  I remember when I was-
[39:15.480 --> 39:17.040]  My mom's in the house.
[39:17.040 --> 39:18.680]  Yeah, so I was like, you wanna shave your back?
[39:18.680 --> 39:20.480]  I'm like, what the fuck would I shave my back for?
[39:20.480 --> 39:21.560]  So it's what it is.
[39:21.560 --> 39:24.560]  You can fuck.
[39:27.600 --> 39:28.640]  What are you drinking?
[39:28.640 --> 39:33.640]  Let's start, I'm drinking this Ninkasi Hayes IPA
[39:34.200 --> 39:35.320]  from Portland.
[39:35.320 --> 39:36.160]  Nice.
[39:36.160 --> 39:37.000]  Yeah, they're-
[39:37.440 --> 39:40.840]  I'm drinking a Knob Creek single barrel by Freddy No.
[39:40.840 --> 39:43.280]  It's about 20 miles south of my farm in Kentucky.
[39:43.280 --> 39:44.560]  Freddy's a buddy of mine.
[39:46.040 --> 39:48.440]  I am day one at quitting smoking cigarettes.
[39:48.440 --> 39:49.920]  So I've had it.
[39:49.920 --> 39:52.080]  Yeah, I got a patch on.
[39:53.080 --> 39:54.680]  It's time with the lime.
[39:54.680 --> 39:56.480]  I'd actually quit smoking cigarettes
[39:56.480 --> 39:58.600]  when I landed in the ICU with meningitis.
[39:58.600 --> 40:02.960]  And when I got out of the hospital after a month,
[40:02.960 --> 40:05.840]  my brain was so fucked when I got out of the hospital.
[40:06.640 --> 40:08.680]  When they got me home, I got in my car,
[40:08.680 --> 40:11.280]  drove to an ex-girlfriend's house that we had together
[40:11.280 --> 40:13.640]  10 years prior, stopped, bought a pack of cigarettes
[40:13.640 --> 40:16.240]  and walked into the house like it was my home.
[40:17.120 --> 40:21.480]  Because my brain, after the meningitis was so slow,
[40:21.480 --> 40:22.960]  and I went back into smoking.
[40:22.960 --> 40:26.400]  And that's about the last vice I really have
[40:26.400 --> 40:29.360]  as far as negative unhealthy living style.
[40:29.360 --> 40:31.000]  And it's time.
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.080]  I promised Kelly from Dragonfly Earth Medicine I'd quit.
[40:34.080 --> 40:37.000]  And it's time to really focus on it.
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.000]  So it has not been the funnest day though,
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.400]  trying to do that.
[40:43.400 --> 40:48.320]  Why, I think Frenchie quit tobacco too, right?
[40:48.320 --> 40:49.520]  Did he?
[40:49.520 --> 40:50.440]  Yeah, I think.
[40:50.440 --> 40:52.680]  Oh man, Frenchie been on the stick for a while.
[40:52.680 --> 40:53.840]  He's French.
[40:53.840 --> 40:54.680]  Yeah.
[40:54.680 --> 40:55.520]  French loved, you know.
[40:56.480 --> 40:59.600]  20 years for me on cigarettes.
[40:59.600 --> 41:04.000]  You can't have tobacco logos on your race motorcycles
[41:04.760 --> 41:06.320]  in France.
[41:06.320 --> 41:10.360]  And so it makes it difficult because the companies
[41:10.360 --> 41:12.560]  that are sponsored by tobacco companies
[41:12.560 --> 41:15.920]  have to find alternate sponsorship for those races.
[41:18.560 --> 41:23.560]  Nick, everybody's cheering you on day one of no cigarettes.
[41:24.600 --> 41:25.720]  You know, I-
[41:25.720 --> 41:29.760]  I would just put a big lip full of Nicorette in your mouth.
[41:29.760 --> 41:30.600]  I'm doing the-
[41:30.600 --> 41:32.920]  You'll be chewing on that all day long.
[41:32.920 --> 41:35.280]  And I, like I said before, I got the Lyme disease
[41:35.280 --> 41:36.480]  and landed in the hospital.
[41:36.480 --> 41:41.480]  I'd quit for a year and it's become more of a just-
[41:41.840 --> 41:44.760]  I do therapy almost every day
[41:44.760 --> 41:46.200]  after the brain swelling and stuff.
[41:46.200 --> 41:49.000]  The therapist talks about like it's meditation
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.040]  in the reverse order.
[41:50.040 --> 41:51.920]  You're drawing off that cigarette
[41:51.920 --> 41:53.960]  and you're just breathing deep.
[41:53.960 --> 41:55.560]  Figure out a different way to do it.
[41:55.560 --> 41:58.520]  So Yellow Hammer Genetics sent me a bunch of hemp.
[41:58.520 --> 42:00.320]  I've been rolling that stuff all day long
[42:00.320 --> 42:01.240]  in between the joints.
[42:01.240 --> 42:04.360]  I think on this YouTube podcast,
[42:04.360 --> 42:05.520]  I've already smoked three joints.
[42:05.520 --> 42:08.560]  So it's-
[42:08.560 --> 42:10.320]  Right now I just need to break that habit.
[42:10.320 --> 42:14.640]  And once that mental part gets past it, it'll be fine.
[42:14.640 --> 42:17.320]  But I was going to say, I told you earlier
[42:17.320 --> 42:20.800]  that quitting was the hardest thing that I've ever done.
[42:20.800 --> 42:22.520]  Maybe one of the hardest, you know.
[42:22.520 --> 42:24.800]  It stands out as the hardest.
[42:24.800 --> 42:27.840]  But I actually read this self-help book
[42:27.840 --> 42:30.920]  and I'm not really super into that sort of shit.
[42:31.600 --> 42:35.760]  But it was like, quit smoking 100% or quit smoking now.
[42:35.760 --> 42:37.640]  And I just read it one day
[42:37.640 --> 42:40.320]  and fucking quit right then and there.
[42:40.320 --> 42:43.560]  And it was about getting myself in the mental place
[42:43.560 --> 42:45.480]  of realizing that every-
[42:45.480 --> 42:47.560]  Like if you have a cigarette right now,
[42:47.560 --> 42:49.760]  you've started the process physically over.
[42:49.760 --> 42:53.600]  And it's a seven day cycle to get your body kicked of it.
[42:53.600 --> 42:54.440]  And so every time you're like,
[42:54.440 --> 42:56.280]  okay, I'm just going to have one puff,
[42:56.280 --> 42:57.760]  you're like restarting the whole thing.
[42:57.760 --> 42:59.240]  So once I kind of understood that,
[42:59.280 --> 43:01.800]  I was like, all right, I got to do the seven day push.
[43:01.800 --> 43:04.600]  And then I, you know, this, after you do the seven days,
[43:04.600 --> 43:05.440]  it gets a lot easier.
[43:05.440 --> 43:06.960]  That's just discipline.
[43:06.960 --> 43:10.120]  My biggest thing right now is I make a lot of people
[43:10.120 --> 43:13.720]  that are sick, Lyme disease people, RSO,
[43:13.720 --> 43:16.880]  lots of people have helped my medical situation.
[43:16.880 --> 43:18.720]  It does not look good when I'm full of cigarette
[43:18.720 --> 43:19.560]  out and light it.
[43:19.560 --> 43:20.920]  It does not look good to the public.
[43:20.920 --> 43:22.760]  It doesn't look good to people.
[43:22.760 --> 43:24.080]  It doesn't look good to the other people
[43:24.080 --> 43:25.000]  that I'm trying to help.
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.880]  So image, what's that?
[43:28.880 --> 43:31.120]  You know, Shannon said, it makes you stink.
[43:31.120 --> 43:35.400]  You know, so it's just time.
[43:35.400 --> 43:37.040]  It's just mentally, you got to do it.
[43:37.040 --> 43:41.040]  And you got a baby doll now, Kev.
[43:43.240 --> 43:44.520]  What, you're muted.
[43:44.520 --> 43:45.360]  I just.
[43:46.320 --> 43:47.840]  That's Quincy.
[43:47.840 --> 43:50.520]  This is my daughter's son, Quincy.
[43:50.520 --> 43:51.360]  That's it.
[43:51.360 --> 43:53.800]  Yeah, clearly the mom is dominant.
[43:53.800 --> 43:55.360]  And this particular one, yeah.
[43:56.360 --> 43:59.080]  But oh man, yeah, Quincy's the man.
[43:59.080 --> 43:59.920]  And so.
[43:59.920 --> 44:01.400]  That is extremely lifelike.
[44:01.400 --> 44:04.040]  Oh no, some of these dolls are unreal.
[44:04.040 --> 44:05.680]  He's like, yo, what's up Nick?
[44:05.680 --> 44:08.800]  That's a long way from Cabbage Patch Kids in the 80s.
[44:08.800 --> 44:10.000]  You know, them Cabbage Patch Kids.
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.520]  Oh yeah, no, these dolls are incredible.
[44:12.520 --> 44:15.280]  All right, so Quincy's signing off.
[44:15.280 --> 44:16.480]  Take him, baby.
[44:16.480 --> 44:18.640]  I'll get Joe, he'll know it's fine.
[44:18.640 --> 44:20.640]  So just.
[44:20.640 --> 44:22.080]  Yeah, I was gonna say, Kevin,
[44:22.080 --> 44:27.080]  can you set the table for why we're talking right now?
[44:29.120 --> 44:33.520]  I thought, and let me cue it up while I'm babbling, but.
[44:35.800 --> 44:38.640]  Will you go give me some roll, Kush, please?
[44:38.640 --> 44:39.480]  There we go.
[44:39.480 --> 44:41.440]  So this is what we're here for.
[44:41.440 --> 44:44.520]  And we have like 300 and something people watching.
[44:44.520 --> 44:47.880]  So we've warmed up the crowd.
[44:47.880 --> 44:49.920]  People are ready.
[44:49.920 --> 44:51.560]  And I think one thing I want to say to everybody
[44:52.040 --> 44:54.720]  is even if you're not gonna go for the Cs,
[44:54.720 --> 44:59.320]  you can certainly go to PayPal and donate a dollar,
[44:59.320 --> 45:02.240]  $2, 420, whatever you want to donate.
[45:02.240 --> 45:03.640]  So with that.
[45:03.640 --> 45:05.000]  Thanks for hosting, Peter.
[45:05.000 --> 45:06.000]  No problem.
[45:06.000 --> 45:10.200]  Well, I just figured like the audience is here
[45:10.200 --> 45:15.200]  and just like people appreciate the programming,
[45:15.480 --> 45:17.920]  show your appreciation.
[45:17.920 --> 45:20.840]  Like I like the idea of giving,
[45:21.120 --> 45:22.920]  and I want to see Delano do this.
[45:22.920 --> 45:25.840]  Like I want to see his vision happen.
[45:25.840 --> 45:28.480]  And Kevin, why don't you set the table
[45:28.480 --> 45:31.680]  for like what's so interesting about this guy
[45:31.680 --> 45:33.320]  who's starting a soil company?
[45:34.640 --> 45:38.520]  Well, you know, whenever you get well-known,
[45:38.520 --> 45:41.320]  you get bombarded with people hitting you up constantly
[45:41.320 --> 45:43.080]  for some bullshit.
[45:43.080 --> 45:47.320]  But Delano was just trying to show me his products.
[45:48.320 --> 45:51.160]  He was really about what he was doing.
[45:51.160 --> 45:53.000]  And he kept showing me pictures
[45:53.000 --> 45:54.520]  of the stuff he was working on.
[45:54.520 --> 45:59.120]  And he was trying to say,
[45:59.120 --> 46:02.120]  hey, look, I'm doing all this different type of compost work
[46:02.120 --> 46:03.480]  and I'm trying to figure out,
[46:03.480 --> 46:06.400]  how do I get into like the cannabis industry?
[46:07.600 --> 46:10.320]  Because I believe that the things that I'm doing
[46:10.320 --> 46:14.840]  would benefit people that had source material to utilize.
[46:15.840 --> 46:18.320]  And so, you know, I don't know really like
[46:18.320 --> 46:19.480]  how do you promote them?
[46:19.480 --> 46:20.640]  And so he hit me up and he said,
[46:20.640 --> 46:21.760]  really what I need is, you know,
[46:21.760 --> 46:23.040]  maybe some help with promotion.
[46:23.040 --> 46:24.920]  Cause he never asked me for any money.
[46:24.920 --> 46:27.480]  He wasn't hitting me up for any cash or anything.
[46:27.480 --> 46:30.080]  He was just really trying to say,
[46:30.080 --> 46:33.000]  hey, you know, could you give me some advice?
[46:33.000 --> 46:34.240]  And so what I did is I said,
[46:34.240 --> 46:36.200]  well, what are you doing right now?
[46:36.200 --> 46:39.240]  And he referred me to this woman named Barbara,
[46:39.240 --> 46:42.560]  who is a owner of a very large soil supply company
[46:42.560 --> 46:43.680]  over in Florida.
[46:43.760 --> 46:45.600]  They're like huge.
[46:45.600 --> 46:47.160]  And so I called her on the phone and said,
[46:47.160 --> 46:49.880]  hey, I'm calling about the Lotto.
[46:49.880 --> 46:53.240]  And she's like, man, this guy's an incredible composter.
[46:53.240 --> 46:56.040]  The kid knows, she's older.
[46:56.040 --> 46:58.000]  So, you know, she's calling him a kid.
[46:59.240 --> 47:00.800]  The kid knows what he's doing
[47:00.800 --> 47:05.360]  and I'm trying to help him figure out how to move forward
[47:05.360 --> 47:08.840]  because she had a desire to see him succeed too.
[47:08.840 --> 47:11.680]  So she and I talked for a while
[47:11.680 --> 47:15.080]  and I was like, what's really the main holdup on this?
[47:15.080 --> 47:17.520]  And it was really funding
[47:17.520 --> 47:22.520]  because of the ability to get a hammer mill
[47:22.520 --> 47:26.080]  and the ability to get source material in at a quantity
[47:26.080 --> 47:28.760]  that would allow him to be able
[47:28.760 --> 47:31.600]  to get enough product into the market
[47:31.600 --> 47:36.280]  so that he could start to get the cycle of business to flow.
[47:36.280 --> 47:38.840]  And so I said, listen, I talked to Barbara
[47:38.840 --> 47:39.760]  and then I talked to Dilana.
[47:39.760 --> 47:41.400]  I said, listen, I said, you know what I'll do Dee is,
[47:42.120 --> 47:43.280]  I said, I'll post up some money.
[47:43.280 --> 47:45.720]  I said, I'll throw some money at you.
[47:45.720 --> 47:48.520]  But I think the best idea to do would be
[47:48.520 --> 47:51.360]  if we could create some kind of situation
[47:51.360 --> 47:53.680]  that would allow us to be able to get more
[47:53.680 --> 47:56.840]  than I can give you myself out of my pocket.
[47:56.840 --> 47:58.960]  And so I said, I have some killer seed stock
[47:58.960 --> 48:01.080]  that I've been holding for a while
[48:01.080 --> 48:04.640]  and I'll put it up for auction.
[48:04.640 --> 48:06.960]  And I talked to Josh and I said, Josh,
[48:06.960 --> 48:08.360]  cause I don't really know how to do auctions.
[48:08.360 --> 48:10.280]  I mean, I'm involved in them.
[48:10.280 --> 48:14.640]  I drive attention to them and I put gear for auction
[48:14.640 --> 48:16.400]  but I've never run an auction.
[48:16.400 --> 48:19.080]  So I hit up Josh and I know cause Josh and Nick
[48:19.080 --> 48:21.200]  had just done that really successful auction
[48:21.200 --> 48:22.880]  for Duke Diamond.
[48:22.880 --> 48:25.560]  And so I said, hey, could you give me a hand with this?
[48:25.560 --> 48:27.720]  And then you got tied into it Pete
[48:27.720 --> 48:32.320]  so that we could platform it through your audience.
[48:32.320 --> 48:33.960]  And really that's what it is.
[48:33.960 --> 48:38.600]  It's people in the industry trying to contribute
[48:38.640 --> 48:41.720]  a small amount of money collectively
[48:41.720 --> 48:45.920]  to help an operator develop a business.
[48:45.920 --> 48:50.320]  And the bottom line is that with all small operators
[48:50.320 --> 48:54.800]  it's always friends and family that are the investors.
[48:54.800 --> 48:57.040]  And I'm not invested in his company.
[48:57.040 --> 48:58.800]  I don't have any stake in his business.
[48:58.800 --> 49:03.360]  This is just purely somebody who consistently sent me photos
[49:03.360 --> 49:08.080]  of his work and was just really trying to figure out
[49:08.600 --> 49:10.120]  how do I move into an industry?
[49:10.120 --> 49:12.160]  Not how do I do my job?
[49:12.160 --> 49:13.280]  He knows what he's doing.
[49:13.280 --> 49:14.160]  There's no question.
[49:14.160 --> 49:16.840]  He's a phenomenal composter.
[49:16.840 --> 49:19.680]  But to get into an industry is difficult
[49:19.680 --> 49:21.320]  and you don't usually have,
[49:21.320 --> 49:23.760]  most people don't have the money to market.
[49:23.760 --> 49:26.760]  And so we figured if we could put together a fund
[49:26.760 --> 49:28.960]  and drive it to him directly,
[49:28.960 --> 49:31.840]  then we'd be able to allow Delano to get
[49:31.840 --> 49:35.720]  some of the resources he needs to move his business forward.
[49:35.720 --> 49:39.040]  And I think he's somebody that is a good man.
[49:39.040 --> 49:42.360]  He's always polite, nice guy, pleasant,
[49:42.360 --> 49:45.640]  but he is obsessed with compost.
[49:45.640 --> 49:46.680]  And that's what I love, man.
[49:46.680 --> 49:50.040]  I like people that are like, you know, on a tangent
[49:50.040 --> 49:51.360]  and he's that dude.
[49:51.360 --> 49:53.520]  And so that's really what the gist of this whole thing was.
[49:53.520 --> 49:57.360]  And I just figured I hate asking people for money.
[49:57.360 --> 50:00.520]  I never learned how to do that when I was young.
[50:00.520 --> 50:02.960]  I get brought in to anchor deals
[50:02.960 --> 50:06.120]  and secure investment for projects,
[50:06.120 --> 50:08.280]  but not because I know how to ask for the cash.
[50:08.280 --> 50:10.480]  It's that I can provide investor confidence
[50:10.480 --> 50:12.720]  that we understand what we're doing.
[50:12.720 --> 50:15.520]  So I usually have to have somebody else ask for money
[50:15.520 --> 50:18.040]  because I've never really asked for it.
[50:18.040 --> 50:19.720]  So it makes it to where like,
[50:19.720 --> 50:22.280]  I need a team to ask for money,
[50:22.280 --> 50:24.280]  but I hate asking for money.
[50:24.280 --> 50:27.160]  So I figured, hey, let's offer some goodies up.
[50:27.160 --> 50:29.600]  And I have an original pack of black lime.
[50:29.600 --> 50:32.120]  It's still sealed with the red, you know,
[50:32.480 --> 50:34.000]  right from that release.
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.880]  And then I got a pack of seed from Jean, same thing,
[50:36.880 --> 50:39.160]  in the little sealed square bottles
[50:39.160 --> 50:42.840]  with the red wax top of that red Hindu.
[50:42.840 --> 50:46.200]  And I knew that both of those were valuable
[50:46.200 --> 50:49.000]  because the black lime reserve seeds you can't find.
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.520]  They don't make them anymore.
[50:50.520 --> 50:51.680]  And that's a hot one.
[50:51.680 --> 50:53.800]  So it's a sealed 10 pack
[50:53.800 --> 50:56.240]  and it's a sealed 10 pack of the Hindu.
[50:56.240 --> 50:57.880]  And I figured that that would be good.
[50:57.880 --> 50:59.200]  And then all of a sudden, you know,
[50:59.200 --> 51:00.120]  there was some interest.
[51:00.120 --> 51:03.560]  And you see the cannabis community kind of rise up
[51:03.560 --> 51:05.640]  and you've got Rebel throwing some seeds,
[51:05.640 --> 51:07.120]  you got Jean throwing some seeds,
[51:07.120 --> 51:09.240]  you got Nick and Josh contributing,
[51:09.240 --> 51:11.880]  you got you taking your time to do this.
[51:11.880 --> 51:14.400]  So, you know, I wanna say thanks for all of you
[51:14.400 --> 51:17.320]  for putting the effort out to help them.
[51:17.320 --> 51:19.480]  And then, you know, you had him on a podcast
[51:19.480 --> 51:20.840]  so we could talk.
[51:20.840 --> 51:23.240]  And once we figure out how to get a little better reception
[51:23.240 --> 51:25.960]  for him where he's at, it would work
[51:25.960 --> 51:30.040]  because we had him on another platform the other day
[51:30.960 --> 51:31.800]  and it was clear.
[51:31.800 --> 51:33.840]  But we need to be able to get him into conversation
[51:33.840 --> 51:36.040]  and get him covered because the stuff that he's doing,
[51:36.040 --> 51:39.240]  the materials that he uses, his approach,
[51:39.240 --> 51:41.480]  it's just really well thought out.
[51:41.480 --> 51:43.840]  And it's the kind of approach that you have to take
[51:43.840 --> 51:46.720]  when you're a small operator self-built.
[51:46.720 --> 51:48.800]  You can't use money to solve the riddle.
[51:48.800 --> 51:50.240]  You have to use ingenuity.
[51:52.000 --> 51:53.920]  And he's a sharp guy.
[51:53.920 --> 51:54.960]  There's no question.
[51:55.840 --> 51:58.960]  Yeah, so I actually just texted him
[51:58.960 --> 52:00.960]  to see if he'll try to jump on,
[52:00.960 --> 52:04.760]  but this is what you're gonna auction off, right?
[52:04.760 --> 52:06.000]  Correct.
[52:06.000 --> 52:06.840]  Okay.
[52:07.920 --> 52:10.360]  Yeah, and I think just quickly, just tell people,
[52:10.360 --> 52:13.240]  I mean, for me, the most interesting thing
[52:13.240 --> 52:18.240]  was just the concept of using Palm as a major-
[52:18.440 --> 52:21.520]  Well, if I can interrupt, let's start the auction
[52:21.520 --> 52:23.360]  and then we can keep talking about them as we-
[52:23.360 --> 52:24.200]  Go for it.
[52:24.520 --> 52:26.320]  The way we did it before was we broke it up
[52:26.320 --> 52:29.560]  into, I think, five-minute sections.
[52:29.560 --> 52:32.120]  So we'll auction five minutes at a time.
[52:32.120 --> 52:33.480]  Is that right, Nick?
[52:33.480 --> 52:34.680]  Yeah, that is right.
[52:34.680 --> 52:36.800]  And one of us needs to keep notes.
[52:36.800 --> 52:39.080]  I got a notebook right here.
[52:39.080 --> 52:40.560]  Peter's gonna help monitor the chat.
[52:40.560 --> 52:42.040]  I got the chat.
[52:42.040 --> 52:43.040]  Cascadia and Grone,
[52:43.040 --> 52:45.680]  if you can help us monitor the chat as well.
[52:45.680 --> 52:47.240]  Yeah, and Cascadia and Grone,
[52:47.240 --> 52:49.600]  I just sent you the Zoom link so you can jump on
[52:49.600 --> 52:51.840]  because when we auction off your stuff,
[52:52.720 --> 52:55.560]  as the hype man, you can hype it up.
[52:55.560 --> 52:56.760]  Well, I was gonna start-
[52:56.760 --> 52:58.160]  Yeah, I was gonna start off with him,
[52:58.160 --> 52:59.280]  so hop on, buddy.
[53:02.720 --> 53:03.840]  Yeah, and so what we'll do is
[53:03.840 --> 53:06.640]  we'll do five minutes per auction
[53:06.640 --> 53:09.920]  and then we allow the sniper action at the end.
[53:09.920 --> 53:11.280]  So once the five-minute bell hits,
[53:11.280 --> 53:13.200]  if someone comes in at,
[53:13.200 --> 53:15.040]  the internet time is slow as shit,
[53:15.040 --> 53:17.480]  so if someone's like, nope, I'm gonna bid this much more,
[53:17.480 --> 53:19.960]  we just let it go until it stops.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.040]  So that five-minute can turn into a half an hour
[53:22.040 --> 53:24.000]  depending on what it is,
[53:24.000 --> 53:25.120]  like the Black Lamb Reserve
[53:25.120 --> 53:27.520]  and those will definitely take more than five minutes
[53:27.520 --> 53:29.840]  to get those run through.
[53:29.840 --> 53:31.320]  But the five-minute gets it going
[53:31.320 --> 53:34.920]  and gets it moving without,
[53:34.920 --> 53:36.640]  and that gives us time to talk about this stuff.
[53:36.640 --> 53:38.280]  So I do wanna talk about Delano's soil,
[53:38.280 --> 53:39.720]  but I just think let's get this rolling.
[53:39.720 --> 53:41.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, definitely.
[53:41.280 --> 53:43.280]  Now that we got a couple hundred people in it
[53:43.280 --> 53:45.920]  and the higher you bid,
[53:45.920 --> 53:48.480]  the more knowledge Kevin will drop.
[53:48.480 --> 53:50.840]  Yeah, and the coolest thing about this
[53:50.840 --> 53:55.840]  was Nick and I did this for Duke a couple of months ago
[53:56.320 --> 53:58.840]  and as we were bullshitting through it,
[53:58.840 --> 54:00.360]  I was like, dude, how cool would this be
[54:00.360 --> 54:01.440]  just if we did this,
[54:01.440 --> 54:04.040]  not when someone was in trouble or where they were sick,
[54:04.040 --> 54:05.840]  because that's a lot of what the community does
[54:05.840 --> 54:07.560]  and it's really beautiful.
[54:07.560 --> 54:10.480]  But we realized that the seeds were being sold
[54:10.480 --> 54:12.760]  for a lot of them are not too much more
[54:12.760 --> 54:15.040]  or sometimes less than what they were retailing for,
[54:15.040 --> 54:16.640]  but they were being donated.
[54:16.640 --> 54:18.160]  So it was like this good thing.
[54:18.840 --> 54:19.680]  And I was like, what if we were just like
[54:19.680 --> 54:23.080]  trying to buy a tractor for somebody who needed a hand up?
[54:23.080 --> 54:25.120]  And then when you hit me about this,
[54:25.120 --> 54:26.720]  it was just like, oh, boom, there it is.
[54:26.720 --> 54:28.280]  That's a perfect opportunity.
[54:28.280 --> 54:30.240]  So Nick and I were just like, let's fuck,
[54:30.240 --> 54:31.280]  yeah, it's awesome, man.
[54:31.280 --> 54:34.400]  So thank you for inviting us to be part of it, dude.
[54:34.400 --> 54:36.800]  And I got the opportunity to meet Delano
[54:36.800 --> 54:38.600]  and spend some time with him.
[54:38.600 --> 54:41.360]  And so I'm totally behind what he's doing as well.
[54:42.800 --> 54:46.680]  So just quickly, Stelther asked a good question,
[54:46.720 --> 54:50.360]  better clarify where you can ship to first.
[54:50.360 --> 54:51.200]  We don't have any,
[54:51.200 --> 54:53.640]  we don't have any problems shipping anywhere.
[54:53.640 --> 54:54.840]  No restrictions.
[54:54.840 --> 54:55.680]  Yeah, no restrictions.
[54:55.680 --> 54:56.840]  If someone's donating.
[54:56.840 --> 54:59.040]  North Korea is probably the only place
[54:59.040 --> 55:00.760]  that's off the table, but other than that.
[55:00.760 --> 55:01.600]  And that's the thing.
[55:01.600 --> 55:03.160]  Fuck it, I'll send them seeds too.
[55:03.160 --> 55:05.400]  North Korea, I wouldn't get down.
[55:05.400 --> 55:08.520]  We can pack it, we can pack it in something.
[55:08.520 --> 55:09.480]  Yeah, I gotta say, yeah,
[55:09.480 --> 55:12.360]  but as a person who sends seeds, right?
[55:12.360 --> 55:15.120]  I'll plug myself, the Regenerative Seed Co,
[55:15.120 --> 55:19.120]  regenerativeseeds.com, and I send seeds everywhere.
[55:19.120 --> 55:20.920]  Sometimes, and with COVID,
[55:20.920 --> 55:22.520]  it's slowed down for different things.
[55:22.520 --> 55:26.480]  So if you're gonna bid $2,000 on these DLRs tonight,
[55:26.480 --> 55:28.760]  and you live in some obscure place,
[55:28.760 --> 55:31.680]  you might have a better plan to secure those seeds
[55:31.680 --> 55:33.000]  and work it out.
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.040]  And we'll work with you, but you know what I'm saying?
[55:36.040 --> 55:38.000]  I wouldn't want those seeds to be confiscated
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.440]  or sitting around somewhere.
[55:39.440 --> 55:41.520]  And I haven't had anything confiscated,
[55:41.520 --> 55:43.720]  going to Canada or all those places, it's all been good.
[55:43.760 --> 55:45.520]  But there's been a couple that bounce around
[55:45.520 --> 55:47.160]  for three or four weeks, and right now,
[55:47.160 --> 55:48.320]  you don't want seeds bouncing around
[55:48.320 --> 55:50.400]  for three or four weeks in the mail.
[55:50.400 --> 55:53.600]  And I just got a package from a breeder
[55:53.600 --> 55:57.320]  that was sent to me with tracking 29 days ago from Colorado.
[55:57.320 --> 56:00.520]  It took 29 days with priority mail
[56:00.520 --> 56:02.480]  for this shit to get to Michigan.
[56:02.480 --> 56:05.920]  So mail is definitely delayed, it has slowed down.
[56:07.040 --> 56:09.960]  But tracking is presented and it's there,
[56:09.960 --> 56:10.880]  and all of us will make sure
[56:10.880 --> 56:12.840]  that everything is right by that.
[56:12.840 --> 56:15.520]  And I have the-
[56:15.520 --> 56:18.160]  Just quickly, Josh, this is what you're talking about.
[56:18.160 --> 56:20.320]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's me, yeah.
[56:20.320 --> 56:22.200]  Okay, go ahead, Kevin.
[56:22.200 --> 56:24.720]  No, I had, so whoever picks these up,
[56:24.720 --> 56:27.240]  just like when we did the Duke Diamond auction,
[56:27.240 --> 56:30.680]  I had a bunch of the Magnum Opus stashed,
[56:30.680 --> 56:33.440]  and I knew that those would drive some real money
[56:33.440 --> 56:34.320]  into Duke's hands.
[56:34.320 --> 56:35.520]  And I don't even know Duke,
[56:35.520 --> 56:38.920]  I just know that people love the dude.
[56:38.920 --> 56:43.680]  And anybody that gets caught in a case with the cops,
[56:43.680 --> 56:46.080]  as long as you didn't do some whack shit with kids,
[56:46.080 --> 56:47.520]  I'm cool.
[56:47.520 --> 56:48.360]  Amen, brother.
[56:48.360 --> 56:49.560]  As long as you caught a legit case,
[56:49.560 --> 56:53.360]  you caught a legit case, I understand.
[56:53.360 --> 56:55.440]  And so when you guys were popping that up,
[56:55.440 --> 56:59.040]  I jumped on and said, hey, let me contribute too.
[56:59.040 --> 57:02.280]  But the thing is that I sent the seeds to the individuals,
[57:02.280 --> 57:04.440]  and then I have a correspondence with them,
[57:04.480 --> 57:05.560]  so they can kind of,
[57:06.440 --> 57:09.640]  they can tap into information,
[57:09.640 --> 57:13.320]  and it's just a good connect, put it that way.
[57:13.320 --> 57:14.520]  So when they get the seeds,
[57:14.520 --> 57:16.960]  it's not like that's the last you see of me.
[57:16.960 --> 57:21.520]  If you buy them, you can kind of talk to me privately,
[57:21.520 --> 57:23.160]  and that's not a bad connect.
[57:24.160 --> 57:25.400]  No, sir.
[57:25.400 --> 57:28.360]  I would like to say real quick for just two seconds,
[57:28.360 --> 57:30.480]  that these options to a lot of these people
[57:30.480 --> 57:32.400]  that may be seeing this on YouTube or whatever,
[57:32.400 --> 57:33.880]  that just do not know me,
[57:33.880 --> 57:37.480]  I am directly alive and having a conversation with you all
[57:37.480 --> 57:39.120]  because of these options.
[57:39.120 --> 57:42.080]  I would have died based off my medical needs last year,
[57:42.080 --> 57:45.160]  at Emerald Mountain and Jackson,
[57:45.160 --> 57:47.560]  and certain individuals, Leo Blockchain,
[57:47.560 --> 57:51.120]  different guys, Dark Horse didn't step up
[57:51.120 --> 57:54.720]  to help provide for all the surgeries that I had to have.
[57:54.720 --> 57:57.280]  But to not just be off a need
[57:57.280 --> 57:59.240]  that somebody's in a medical situation,
[57:59.240 --> 58:01.080]  but somebody has a hope or a dream
[58:01.120 --> 58:02.480]  that the people can come together and say,
[58:02.480 --> 58:04.920]  fuck it, let's jump in on this,
[58:04.920 --> 58:07.040]  make the whole community better by that.
[58:07.040 --> 58:10.120]  Me and Josh have been talking about that since I got sick
[58:10.120 --> 58:11.840]  and we talked about giving back.
[58:13.120 --> 58:16.320]  So I would tell people like, hey, this is an opportunity,
[58:16.320 --> 58:18.600]  not only to get an awesome pack,
[58:18.600 --> 58:21.320]  but when you look at that Fino in the future,
[58:21.320 --> 58:24.120]  and you're like, there's my Fino of Black Lime Reserve,
[58:24.120 --> 58:26.640]  but there's also the chance that I gave somebody
[58:27.760 --> 58:29.480]  to do their thing,
[58:29.480 --> 58:31.800]  it brings a lot more emotion to that plan.
[58:31.800 --> 58:33.760]  And that's very, very important.
[58:34.720 --> 58:36.560]  It's like I said, it's the whole reason
[58:36.560 --> 58:38.480]  I'm sitting here talking with you guys.
[58:38.480 --> 58:40.920]  Without these auctions, I wouldn't even be alive anymore.
[58:40.920 --> 58:44.680]  So to be able to help somebody just to get something up
[58:44.680 --> 58:47.960]  and going off the ground, that's an amazing, amazing thing.
[58:47.960 --> 58:50.240]  But Josh, if you wanna get that going.
[58:50.240 --> 58:53.760]  Yeah, so we'll have the money as direct deposited
[58:53.760 --> 58:56.280]  into his PayPal.
[58:56.280 --> 58:58.400]  And Peter, if you can post that up,
[58:58.400 --> 59:00.320]  that would be pretty great.
[59:00.320 --> 59:03.840]  If you guys wanna donate to that, that's cool too.
[59:03.840 --> 59:07.840]  And I will say that we had,
[59:07.840 --> 59:09.760]  with the last auction we ran,
[59:09.760 --> 59:13.960]  we had almost 100% success with getting everything through,
[59:13.960 --> 59:15.520]  but I wanna just be real transparent.
[59:15.520 --> 59:17.680]  There was one hiccup we had,
[59:17.680 --> 59:21.640]  and I think that we can solve it with Kev,
[59:21.640 --> 59:23.920]  I think has a cut and we can talk about it off air,
[59:23.920 --> 59:26.040]  but we can solve this little hiccup we had
[59:26.040 --> 59:28.920]  on a Black Lime Reserve cut that was auctioned off.
[59:30.920 --> 59:33.280]  That guy kind of got lost and the person
[59:33.280 --> 59:35.080]  that was donating it had an issue
[59:35.080 --> 59:37.600]  where their housing situation closed down
[59:37.600 --> 59:39.600]  and they lost the cut in a move situation
[59:39.600 --> 59:41.840]  and it was a bad deal.
[59:41.840 --> 59:45.400]  So just wanted to like kind of throw that all out there
[59:45.400 --> 59:47.480]  that it's been pretty smooth
[59:47.480 --> 59:49.640]  and the money goes straight into their account.
[59:49.640 --> 59:51.840]  So there's no fuckery on our end.
[59:51.840 --> 59:54.280]  Yeah, none of us touched any of this money.
[59:54.280 --> 59:55.120]  So,
[59:57.400 --> 01:00:00.360]  so anyways, I wanna introduce the first auction
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:03.040]  is donated by this gentleman, Cascadian Grown.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.440]  Nice to see you in person, sir.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.080]  We've been chatting on the internet for quite some time
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.520]  and you've donated before.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:13.880]  And also before I just release you to talk about this,
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.480]  I wanna shout out Mr. Green Jeans.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.080]  You guys gotta check him out.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.120]  I told Peter today, you gotta get him on.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.400]  He's actually one of my main breeding mentors,
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.720]  Jim and Jackson.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.040]  I talked to him more than I talked to Jackson
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.320]  and he's a really experienced guy.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.080]  And he was the guy that did the original
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.280]  Maui Wowie cherry bomb.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.680]  And so that's what this pack is that he's donating.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:39.240]  And you can talk about it,
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.640]  but I just wanted to shout out,
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.120]  Doug, he's a fucking cool dude in Southern California.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.840]  I don't know if you've had a chance to meet him, Kev,
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.360]  but he's definitely, he's an old school cat.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.200]  He's got a couple of years on you.
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:53.560]  He must be ancient.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.400]  Yeah.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.240]  Yeah.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.840]  So the pack I got here for auction is,
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:01.760]  it's called cherry bomb,
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:05.400]  but it's a 1979 Maui Wowie line that's been inbred.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:10.000]  So, I mean, they lost count honestly of what generation it is
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.360]  but it's somewhere North of F25, somewhere around F30.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.200]  It's incredible.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.440]  I just felt the need to preserve it.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.320]  So when I went through it,
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.320]  I gathered up four, 10 packs of seeds
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.440]  from me and some friends.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:30.520]  Out of those 40 seeds, I selected 16.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:35.000]  And then out of the 16, I threw in the flower,
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  15 ended up making it, no, 13 ended up making it.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.800]  11 ladies, two males, sorry, I'm looking at my notes.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.480]  I had 11 ladies and two males.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.320]  And this line is known for a,
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.640]  Mr. Greenjeans used to select
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.000]  for a metallic cherry terpene profile.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.800]  So out of the 11 ladies,
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.960]  four of the ladies had both the metallic cherry terpene
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.920]  profile with the pink pistols
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.520]  that the line's also known for.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.480]  So you got a pretty good chance at finding
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.000]  that same profile in these seeds.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.280]  There's 50 seeds.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.480]  What's the high like?
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.760]  It's, I only really smoked the chaff,
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.480]  you know, what was left after I de-seeded it.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.120]  So it was pretty clean.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.880]  I remember the cherry and the metallic
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.680]  more than I remember the high, the flavor was-
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:27.520]  Totally.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.480]  A metallic cherry sounds killer.
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.760]  It's, man, it's amazing.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:36.040]  It was, it's pretty sativa.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.600]  It's kind of up, it's kind of clear.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.520]  It's got that sunshine, you know,
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.400]  it's that sunshine we were talking about earlier.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.160]  Turns a rainy day into a sunny day.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.240]  It's pretty nice.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.160]  I was a big fan of it.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.640]  Obviously I saved a bunch of seed
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.080]  and here's a chance for somebody else to get some too.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:53.920]  Awesome.
[01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:58.510]  Cool, bro.
[01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:00.230]  Well, that's super fucking cool of you, man.
[01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:03.630]  And yeah, so let's start this auction off.
[01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:05.350]  If you can help out with the monitoring,
[01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:08.190]  the chat through this, it's hard for me to do it all,
[01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:10.390]  but I'll start the timer now and we're gonna,
[01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:11.550]  what should we start it at, man?
[01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:12.390]  You call it out.
[01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.190]  Your pack of seeds, man.
[01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:16.990]  I don't know, man.
[01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:19.590]  We're putting 50 of them up there.
[01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:21.110]  It's a fair number.
[01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:24.910]  I didn't even think that far.
[01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:27.190]  Let's start at a hundred bucks.
[01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:29.070]  Sure, that's good with me.
[01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:30.790]  That's a fair fucking deal.
[01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:34.310]  If you can get 50 seeds of IBLs like this,
[01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:35.950]  you put this into just about anything
[01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:38.070]  and come up with something cool, you know?
[01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:41.230]  And if you guys, you wanna check out
[01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:46.230]  Mr. Mean Jeans, you can check out the Potent Products
[01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:48.590]  podcast that Steve Reisner does.
[01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:50.830]  That's where I met him and he's on that thing all the time.
[01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:53.150]  If you go back, he drops a lot of knowledge
[01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:55.670]  and him and I just kind of became friends on there,
[01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:57.030]  but he's a real cool guy.
[01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:59.830]  He's a musician and a big gardener.
[01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:00.950]  Follow him on Instagram.
[01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:02.670]  He's always doing some cool stuff.
[01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:04.950]  Yeah, and I just sent him an email
[01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:06.910]  to see if he wants to jump on.
[01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:07.750]  Cool.
[01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:08.590]  He's a cool guy.
[01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:10.430]  Let's see if he wants to jump on.
[01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:11.270]  Cool.
[01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:12.110]  He may do that.
[01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:12.950]  He's a brilliant guy.
[01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:14.190]  Is that Steve?
[01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:15.590]  No, no, no.
[01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:17.030]  Mr. Green Jeans.
[01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:18.390]  Oh, it's Green Jeans.
[01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:19.230]  Yeah.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.160]  So anyways, we were kind of starting to talk,
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.480]  get into talking about Delano's,
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.600]  what he uses to make his base.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.800]  And one thing that is really interesting
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.720]  is that the bases that we typically see in potting soils,
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:39.000]  which is what is in a bag, it's a potting soil.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.920]  It's not meant to be the soil in your ground.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.840]  It's a potting soil.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.080]  It's meant to go in a pot and be lightweight.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.680]  That's the whole concept.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.800]  Anyways, it's peat and cork.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.400]  Those are the two main monsters.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.160]  I mean, there's really not a whole lot out there,
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:56.720]  but his main medium that he's kind of settled into,
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.760]  and he's experimented with a lot,
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.720]  which was what was really exciting.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:04.120]  He experimented with peanuts, a ton of stuff,
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.080]  but what he settled into was palm.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.520]  And what is exciting about it
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.720]  is the nutrient load that palm has as a base material,
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.320]  which is when you harvest it, it's fully loaded,
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:17.920]  but it's also a native product to us here in the US.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:21.680]  It skirts the whole Southern part of our border,
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:24.200]  and we have it in bounty.
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.280]  And so it's just a way to be,
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.680]  to close the sustainable gap a little bit more.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.640]  Obviously I advocate, if you're gonna grow,
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.920]  you should grow in the ground or make your own soil.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.720]  And I teach and talk about that and host seminars,
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.280]  but I also do use potting soils for my clones.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.080]  So you gotta be real about that.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:47.600]  And I can have that made,
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:51.000]  but the stuff I've had it made out of was peat from Canada.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.040]  And I'm kind of really interested in this palm product.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.520]  Yeah, no, that's what I liked about it too,
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:04.000]  because the thing is, is that by hanging out with you
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.760]  and being part of the Regen Group,
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.720]  you start to see what that really means,
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.600]  which is sustainability and low impact.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.200]  And the fact of not having to ship products
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.360]  across the world to utilize.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.840]  And I like that because ultimately,
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.840]  as we move into what we're gonna move into,
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.720]  which is a more competitive model,
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.680]  the ability to utilize things that are closer
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.500]  to you geographically brings your costs down.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.400]  And so for him, highlighting,
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.120]  I use all these products that are local to my areas
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.280]  and I choose these things and I play with these things.
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.280]  It's just that, man, I would love to bring them out
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:49.680]  sometime to California and have them do some compost,
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.920]  just using the stuff off the mountain.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.600]  Because I have a tremendous amount of wood product
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.760]  and he's really knowledgeable
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.840]  about running softwood, hardwood, intermediate
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:04.000]  and the breakdown process and how you combine them,
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:04.880]  because it's the same thing.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:09.360]  He has access through all the forests in Georgia, Florida.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.120]  So it's just really an interesting approach
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:16.280]  and it's non-conventional and it's one that makes sense
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:19.000]  for small operators to understand
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.480]  because a lot of it's inspiring
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:23.280]  about how do you utilize the things that are close to you
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.960]  and how do you make the most of what you have?
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.920]  And the products are solid.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.960]  Some of the photos he's sending me,
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.120]  the fungal content is, the shit's insane.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.320]  It looks almost like a,
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.520]  you know what I mean?
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.800]  Yeah, it's exploding.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.600]  We got 30 seconds left.
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.840]  So I try to give the one minute warning,
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.680]  but you guys gotta, I should have said,
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.240]  follow the chat for the bidding.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.680]  So we're at 300 bucks here, under 30 seconds left.
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.000]  So thank you guys for that.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.040]  I don't know who's got it.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.600]  How do you follow the chat?
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.560]  I got a 320.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.520]  So you gotta go log on to YouTube
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.760]  and then pause the video and then look at the chat
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.960]  and then there's a button on the side
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.640]  and you can open a separate pop-up.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:07.280]  So we got 320, I see with Dil Will.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.160]  And this one is worth every fucking penny on this.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.840]  Oh dude, you're getting 50 seeds.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.680]  Yeah.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:15.920]  Man, six bucks a seed.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:17.120]  All right, that's our timer.
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:17.960]  So I think we're at 325.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.800]  I think we had Greg H at 325, right?
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.720]  We got a sniper at 325.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.120]  I have JG Murdoch, 350.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.520]  Oh, there we go.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.360]  Thank you for watching that.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.200]  My internet's not keeping up as fast.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.280]  I was also gonna say the other part
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.920]  that adds to the sustainability,
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:40.080]  and I think will add to the price reduction in the end,
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.680]  is his rapid composting method.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:45.280]  It's not a long term cycle that, you know,
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.960]  space, time, takes up money,
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.960]  but he can knock this stuff out,
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.400]  a cycle in 10, 12 days, you know, type deal.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.400]  Which is impressive because I remember,
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.920]  I was involved in a composting project years ago
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:02.760]  where the professor that I was involved with
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:06.880]  created the system that one of the municipalities used.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.040]  And he had created these huge concrete run,
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.880]  they, well, you drove into them,
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:15.440]  but they were sloped and they had aeration chambers
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:18.440]  underneath it so that he could push oxygen through it
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:21.240]  to increase the speed of combustion.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.920]  And he designed it to fit the size of the machinery
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.640]  they had, and they would come in
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.400]  and then they would just dump it into the other one
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.680]  to make one flip to turn it.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.920]  But the way that he created that system
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.680]  to speed the process, because it was the same thing,
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.800]  he said, you can't take this long and make any money.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.840]  And for the city, it was really just about
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.400]  trying to turn over organic material,
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.520]  get it broken down so they could then redeposit it,
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.040]  and then they could sell it also,
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.040]  but it was also for their own usage.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.440]  And that's what was interesting with Delano,
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.760]  whereas he had an accelerated composting technique.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.080]  Yep, Robert Hazleton, we got you at 390.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.600]  Any last bidders?
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.120]  Going once, going twice.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.560]  You got it, bro.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.520]  Thank you very much, Cascadian Grown.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.320]  Thank you.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:16.040]  Thank you very much, man.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.960]  So Rob, just donate to the GoFundMe,
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:23.960]  and then hit up Cascade Grown on Instagram,
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.520]  and Cascadian Grown,
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.400]  and he can mail you out those seeds direct.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.240]  We'll just send him a photo of your donation
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.440]  is all you need to do, and it's real simple.
[01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:40.410]  So next up is a guy that you introduced me to,
[01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:44.050]  Kev, Olfactory Genetics, and he's got a photo.
[01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:45.330]  Oh, he's got some killer shit.
[01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:46.610]  Yeah, he's got some killer shit,
[01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:47.930]  and we'll talk about him.
[01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:49.490]  I wanna talk about the sleeper hold.
[01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:51.810]  It's the PK that you've been tossing out.
[01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:56.810]  Cross in Afghanistan, Bat Cross that he had.
[01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:58.490]  I'm not sure where he came across that sucker.
[01:10:58.490 --> 01:10:59.330]  I can't remember.
[01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:02.490]  I know he told me, but off the cuff, I can't remember.
[01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:05.890]  But we're gonna start that one off at 100 bucks.
[01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:07.250]  He donated that.
[01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:09.010]  Thank you very much.
[01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:12.850]  And I'm gonna start the timer now.
[01:11:12.850 --> 01:11:13.690]  Let's see here.
[01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:14.530]  Get back to it.
[01:11:14.530 --> 01:11:16.890]  Yeah, he used that LAPK on that.
[01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:17.730]  Yeah.
[01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:18.570]  I'm telling you, that shit,
[01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:20.530]  anything you lay pollen into that thing,
[01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:22.010]  it comes out incredible.
[01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:24.850]  The plant itself is phenomenal.
[01:11:24.850 --> 01:11:27.450]  The quality to high, it's a killer.
[01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:29.490]  But when it's used in breeding projects,
[01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:31.410]  oh my God, that's stunning.
[01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:35.810]  And he came down to check me out,
[01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:37.770]  because he's up, I think, from like,
[01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:39.690]  I wanna say Portland, Seattle.
[01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:44.290]  Yeah, he was working with the Heroes guys.
[01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:46.490]  Yup, yup, yup, here's the buzz.
[01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:49.810]  Yup, and he came down to see me to grab some stock,
[01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:52.370]  and he's just a really nice dude.
[01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:54.490]  And so he and I hit it off,
[01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:56.410]  and I put him into some material
[01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:59.330]  that I thought would help him out with what he was doing.
[01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:02.410]  And then I'm watching the work that he's putting in,
[01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:04.610]  and he's putting in some good, he's sharp.
[01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:07.090]  He's a sharp guy, and he's a really good dude.
[01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:09.850]  And I really love to see his company succeed, man.
[01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:14.930]  I like to see people do well.
[01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:16.850]  Yeah, we did a couple interviews,
[01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:19.250]  so you can go onto my YouTube and check it out.
[01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:20.690]  That's pretty much all I do on there,
[01:12:20.690 --> 01:12:22.290]  is put the Regen Conference stuff,
[01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:24.970]  and then the breeders that I'm working with,
[01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:27.290]  I interview them on specifically their gear
[01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:28.130]  they're putting out.
[01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:30.410]  And we did a couple with him,
[01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:33.290]  and the YouTube is just Regenerative Cannabis,
[01:12:34.570 --> 01:12:36.010]  like my little thingy.
[01:12:36.010 --> 01:12:39.770]  But I forgot what I was saying,
[01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:41.850]  but he's just a real interesting, humble dude,
[01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:43.810]  and he's doing legit work.
[01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:50.050]  Oh, what I was gonna say is he was the,
[01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:51.690]  I just think this is cool,
[01:12:52.530 --> 01:12:53.730]  because he's so passionate.
[01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:55.770]  He was actually the general manager,
[01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:57.130]  I don't know if that was the exact title,
[01:12:57.130 --> 01:12:59.610]  but he was running the show for Heroes,
[01:12:59.610 --> 01:13:01.650]  kind of right next to Pat.
[01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:05.330]  And he wanted to be more in touch with the plant
[01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:06.730]  and get into breeding,
[01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:08.170]  so he actually just stepped away
[01:13:08.170 --> 01:13:10.090]  intentionally to do this project.
[01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:11.210]  Things were going good there,
[01:13:11.210 --> 01:13:12.050]  and he was just like,
[01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:14.210]  you know what, I've kind of been a management role,
[01:13:14.210 --> 01:13:16.290]  and I'd rather be working the plant,
[01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:17.850]  and so he backed down.
[01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:19.450]  And I don't know, that says a lot
[01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:23.570]  to walk back down from a really successful small business.
[01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:25.970]  They're kicking ass in Oregon,
[01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:28.530]  but they are, from what I understand,
[01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:31.050]  a small business and privately owned,
[01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:33.170]  and Pat seems like a really fucking cool dude.
[01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:36.090]  I don't know him personally, but you know.
[01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:38.250]  He posts some hysterical shit.
[01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:40.690]  Yeah, the zeros are the far shit.
[01:13:40.690 --> 01:13:42.570]  Yeah, it's fucking hysterical.
[01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:46.530]  Hey, and then we've got a chat going on too from Cascadian.
[01:13:46.570 --> 01:13:47.930]  He's been dropping us some stuff.
[01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:50.090]  It's interesting proposition.
[01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:53.290]  Well, yeah, there's a delay between us talking on here
[01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:55.170]  and then the chat room.
[01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:59.370]  So if we could start and end the deals in the chat room,
[01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:00.890]  I think it'd be a little bit more fair,
[01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:02.570]  and since this one got a little messed up,
[01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:05.530]  if J.G. Murdoch wants to match Robert's bid,
[01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:07.050]  I can get him 52.
[01:14:08.690 --> 01:14:10.450]  Hell yeah, man, that's so cool.
[01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:12.210]  That's fucking cool as shit.
[01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:13.050]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[01:14:13.050 --> 01:14:15.050]  There's a delay, and that shit's just not fair,
[01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:16.690]  and that doesn't sit right with me.
[01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:18.410]  So if he wants to match Robert's bid,
[01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:21.290]  I'll peel him out 52, and we'll just call it like that.
[01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:22.370]  And then maybe from here on,
[01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:25.050]  we can do the start and the end in the chat room
[01:14:25.050 --> 01:14:28.210]  because there's a delay, and it's just, it's not fair.
[01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:29.050]  Gotcha.
[01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:30.170]  No, no, totally.
[01:14:30.170 --> 01:14:31.610]  So the equity program.
[01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:34.450]  Can you start it with the text?
[01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:37.050]  They put you on the internet, and then they fuck you.
[01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:40.250]  I set up another phone so I can watch the,
[01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:44.090]  or a couple phones, so I can see the chats,
[01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:45.930]  and there is a good 30-second delay
[01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:49.410]  between what's in one phone and in the others.
[01:14:49.410 --> 01:14:51.250]  So where are they at with this?
[01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:54.970]  So the short of it is we have two people
[01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:59.970]  who can both go to PayPal and make a $390 donation, correct?
[01:15:01.170 --> 01:15:03.250]  And that is who?
[01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:05.090]  Robert.
[01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:06.130]  Yep.
[01:15:06.130 --> 01:15:08.250]  And J. Murdoch.
[01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:09.090]  Okay.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.360]  And thank you guys, both of you guys.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.720]  That's super fucking cool.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.360]  J.G. Murdoch.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.360]  And that's where you're going, paypal.me.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.680]  Delano Silver.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:25.800]  It's funny how we have to-
[01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:26.640]  So where are we at?
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.800]  We're about a minute left on these sleeper holds.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.200]  Sorry to cut you off, Kev.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:33.840]  Where are we at with them in the chat?
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.480]  Go ahead, Kev.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.920]  Oh no, just how we all pronounce.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:44.160]  It's funny, I destroy every name I pronounce.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.480]  And so your pronunciation of his name
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.040]  sounds a lot better than mine.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:54.000]  Everybody in the world calls me Rizden instead of Rizden.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.640]  So it's just all based off of how it's written, I guess.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:02.560]  I wanna say, I think that he got some of the Afghani stock
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:07.560]  from, and I know that he got a Burmese from Adam Dunn,
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.560]  but he might've got some of that Afghani from Adam Dunn too
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.040]  or Adam Dunn from Adam Dunn Show
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:20.000]  and what's that, THC Seeds?
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:20.840]  I think that's right.
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.120]  I remember from the interview.
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:22.960]  I think so.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.720]  That's the timer there.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.240]  He gave me a packet of sleeper holds so I could run them
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:29.840]  and I just haven't had a chance to crack them.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.040]  And I wanna go run through
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.800]  just to pull out some killer smoke
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.080]  because I know that the Afghan line that he got,
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:39.900]  he was impressed with, and then he loves that PK.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.120]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.200]  And I think I'm going through too.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.480]  I'm about to flower it out right now.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:49.080]  We're at 185.
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.360]  Right, let's start the bid off.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.960]  If somebody wants to type in chat,
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:54.080]  I don't know who wants to do it,
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:55.560]  but if somebody wants to start a bid off,
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.360]  we already had a bid at 185 so we could start it there.
[01:17:04.570 --> 01:17:06.610]  I forgot what I was gonna say.
[01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:07.450]  My bad.
[01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:09.290]  That's good.
[01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:10.290]  Trying to make it fair, man.
[01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:12.770]  Yeah, no, thank you.
[01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:13.930]  I'm an auction rookie.
[01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:17.250]  It's hard to manage it all, honestly,
[01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:19.530]  with the different chats and the delay.
[01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:20.890]  I'll do the starts and the ends
[01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:24.130]  if you guys clue me in to when it is.
[01:17:24.130 --> 01:17:26.810]  All right, so are we ready for the next one?
[01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:29.130]  I think we're at 185 at Scallywag.
[01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:31.770]  Is that, what line is it?
[01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:34.930]  That's the sleeper hold.
[01:17:34.930 --> 01:17:37.450]  Afghani to a LA Pure Kush.
[01:17:37.450 --> 01:17:38.610]  Yep, the sleeper hold.
[01:17:40.170 --> 01:17:41.930]  And that LA Pure Kush is phenomenal.
[01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:44.610]  I've held them all the 14 years.
[01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:47.170]  Is that the same cut that you passed me, Kev?
[01:17:47.170 --> 01:17:50.330]  Yes, the one that has the super resistance.
[01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:51.170]  Yeah.
[01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:55.250]  Or I mean, it has an incredible effect on spasticity,
[01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:57.090]  but I mean, it's phenomenal smoke.
[01:17:57.090 --> 01:17:58.410]  This is UK RSO.
[01:17:58.410 --> 01:17:59.890]  Oh, nice.
[01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:03.010]  Yeah, man, I had this one turned into rosin
[01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:05.050]  and then I turned it into RSO.
[01:18:05.050 --> 01:18:08.010]  That's the first time I've done it that way.
[01:18:08.010 --> 01:18:09.850]  I'm trying to cut out the alcohol.
[01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:13.890]  I hold my health doing so good this summer
[01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:16.290]  to this and the Royal Kush right now, brother.
[01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:20.370]  This is, I am not having the,
[01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:21.930]  I mean, I still have about three
[01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:23.810]  temperature regulation seizures a week
[01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:25.450]  when I get out of the shower,
[01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:27.850]  or like we had a weird,
[01:18:27.850 --> 01:18:29.570]  the high in Michigan where I'm at today
[01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:31.770]  was 74 when it was 90 yesterday,
[01:18:31.770 --> 01:18:34.170]  so I had a little minor one this morning.
[01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:35.250]  But dude, I'm telling you,
[01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:38.490]  I'm down from 25 temperature regulation seizures
[01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:40.290]  to about three a week.
[01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:41.130]  Oh, that's incredible.
[01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:41.970]  I'm happy.
[01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:44.130]  Also-
[01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:44.970]  It's unreal.
[01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:46.250]  We've seen it work on so many people
[01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:47.930]  with any kind of spasm.
[01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:50.330]  I love it because the smoke is so complete
[01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:53.010]  and the flavor is so,
[01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:56.170]  it's really in the pre-98 bubble cluster.
[01:18:56.170 --> 01:18:58.850]  It's related in those lines.
[01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:01.490]  Well, I mean, even outside of that is like,
[01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:03.930]  I'm catching a buzz from the RSO.
[01:19:03.930 --> 01:19:06.850]  Around midnight tonight, I'll be giggly
[01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:09.450]  and I will eat everything in the kitchen
[01:19:09.450 --> 01:19:11.410]  that Shannon has laid out for me.
[01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:14.130]  That may be the only calories that actually,
[01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:15.930]  I haven't eaten all of the day.
[01:19:15.930 --> 01:19:18.930]  I got up at 6 a.m., it's what, 9, 10?
[01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:20.890]  With my diseases, I don't eat.
[01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:22.330]  I eat in the middle of the night.
[01:19:22.330 --> 01:19:23.970]  I wake up from the RSO.
[01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:27.130]  Shannon will pre-make a meal and I fuck that stuff up.
[01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:29.250]  I'm completely out of my mind,
[01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:31.650]  high from the RSO.
[01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:34.650]  And it goes into a very much,
[01:19:34.690 --> 01:19:38.370]  the PK still holds that hunger,
[01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:40.450]  munchy factor in there for it.
[01:19:40.450 --> 01:19:42.930]  So even outside of the spasticity,
[01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:45.450]  it makes me very hungry in the middle of the night.
[01:19:45.450 --> 01:19:48.370]  And I'm taking on 5,000 calories
[01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:50.690]  at three o'clock in the morning, midnight,
[01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:51.850]  one o'clock in the morning.
[01:19:51.850 --> 01:19:54.650]  For me, that is what keeps all my calories going.
[01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:59.290]  So it has massive medical benefits from that structure,
[01:19:59.290 --> 01:20:00.690]  but I'm also sleeping better.
[01:20:00.690 --> 01:20:03.050]  Bubble Cush is the best strain RSO-wise
[01:20:03.490 --> 01:20:05.730]  just knocks me out to get me to sleep.
[01:20:05.730 --> 01:20:07.770]  And a lot of the people I've made RSO for,
[01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:09.490]  they're dealing with cancer
[01:20:09.490 --> 01:20:11.250]  and are undergoing chemo at the time.
[01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:13.730]  They need to sleep so the medicine can do its job.
[01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:15.770]  Bubble Cush is the best factor for that.
[01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:18.050]  Just knock your ass out, go to sleep.
[01:20:18.050 --> 01:20:22.530]  The PK is giving me a solid four hours of sleep
[01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:23.890]  before I wake up.
[01:20:23.890 --> 01:20:26.250]  Boom, coming at the 300.
[01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.090]  Josh, you got the timer going, right?
[01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:30.810]  We passed that timer, shit, man.
[01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:31.650]  We're Snipes City.
[01:20:31.650 --> 01:20:33.250]  These guys just came in with 300.
[01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:34.810]  Yeah, when I got to LA-
[01:20:34.810 --> 01:20:37.890]  Just let me know when to wrap it up.
[01:20:37.890 --> 01:20:40.010]  I got so high when I smoked it
[01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:42.330]  that I was afraid to go over to someone's house
[01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:44.490]  to collect money they owed me.
[01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:46.730]  And I started laughing and I was like, well, I'm lit.
[01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:50.650]  And I couldn't get rid of it.
[01:20:50.650 --> 01:20:52.130]  You know, and then we-
[01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:54.170]  Ten seeds in a pack, guys.
[01:20:54.170 --> 01:20:57.490]  I gave it to a friend for a spasticity issue
[01:20:57.490 --> 01:21:00.330]  and we just noticed this incredible power
[01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:01.170]  that it had over it.
[01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:03.330]  And I started to utilize it in that form
[01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:05.530]  medicinally for individuals.
[01:21:05.530 --> 01:21:10.210]  But for me, it's just such a rich earth, coffee, chocolate,
[01:21:10.210 --> 01:21:14.210]  just full flavor all the way to the roach.
[01:21:14.210 --> 01:21:15.530]  Just phenomenal.
[01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:19.090]  And I've laid it into a lot of other lines.
[01:21:19.090 --> 01:21:23.490]  And that plant is a special one.
[01:21:23.490 --> 01:21:27.210]  And I know that the Afghan line that he's using
[01:21:27.210 --> 01:21:28.130]  is developed too.
[01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:30.610]  So it should be a really, really well done
[01:21:30.610 --> 01:21:32.290]  like foundation stock.
[01:21:32.290 --> 01:21:35.010]  You should be able to take that seed batch from him
[01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:38.450]  and go run with it and use it to build other lines.
[01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:40.450]  Let's call it there.
[01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:43.450]  DC from Detroit, 300 bucks.
[01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:44.490]  Thank you very much, sir.
[01:21:44.490 --> 01:21:45.770]  Beautiful, thank you.
[01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:46.610]  Yeah.
[01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:50.530]  Fucking cool, dude.
[01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:53.930]  This next one is also really exciting.
[01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:56.090]  Tyler from Family Tree Seeds.
[01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:57.650]  I think you got a chance to meet him, Kevin,
[01:21:58.170 --> 01:21:59.010]  at the Rejaring Place.
[01:21:59.010 --> 01:21:59.850]  Okay, he's hella cool.
[01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:00.690]  Yeah, hella cool.
[01:22:00.690 --> 01:22:04.010]  And he packed the bags.
[01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:05.890]  You have the bag seed years ago
[01:22:05.890 --> 01:22:07.330]  when he was in high school or some shit.
[01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:09.890]  It was named Pam Anderson, his bag seed.
[01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:12.330]  And we tested on the Phylos thing.
[01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:13.810]  It was a standalone.
[01:22:13.810 --> 01:22:18.290]  And so this is what he offered me was unreleased to anybody.
[01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:19.570]  He offered me two options.
[01:22:19.570 --> 01:22:23.050]  One that had been released to Nick and one other dude.
[01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:26.090]  And then just, this is Pam Anderson BX.
[01:22:26.490 --> 01:22:28.090]  He hasn't given to anybody else.
[01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:31.690]  So I'm not sure how many seeds he's gonna put in here.
[01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:33.970]  I gotta look it up here real quick.
[01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:36.130]  Tyler, if you're watching, text me.
[01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:36.970]  Yeah, no, Tyler's sharp, man.
[01:22:36.970 --> 01:22:38.250]  He's a smart dude.
[01:22:39.690 --> 01:22:41.250]  That's the beauty of the Regen Conference.
[01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:42.970]  25 seeds, 25 seeds.
[01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:44.410]  So you get a good look at it.
[01:22:44.410 --> 01:22:46.330]  And it's a standalone.
[01:22:46.330 --> 01:22:51.330]  I mean, I popped, I think, 200 of them of his F2s.
[01:22:51.490 --> 01:22:54.050]  You know, not these, the F2s to look at.
[01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:56.410]  And we talked on the phone as I sniffed
[01:22:56.410 --> 01:22:58.010]  through all the mails and stem rubbed.
[01:22:58.010 --> 01:23:00.970]  And we found, we were seeing what he was talking about.
[01:23:00.970 --> 01:23:03.690]  It's really fucking fun to do that with these guys.
[01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:09.430]  But let's start this one at 300 bucks, man.
[01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:13.930]  This is well worth 300 bucks on this one.
[01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:16.330]  This is one that you can put into anything.
[01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:17.970]  And it's gonna fucking do something with
[01:23:17.970 --> 01:23:19.730]  because it's a standalone.
[01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:21.090]  It's different, you know?
[01:23:22.090 --> 01:23:22.930]  Yeah, you'll-
[01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:27.930]  Pam Anderson is so important to me genetically-wise.
[01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:31.970]  Let's start the five minutes now, Cascadian.
[01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:32.810]  Sorry.
[01:23:32.810 --> 01:23:36.850]  You gotta find the Tommy Lee line to go into it.
[01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:40.250]  That's the one that's real long, right?
[01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:42.090]  Yeah, yeah, long for flowers.
[01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:42.930]  Yeah.
[01:23:42.930 --> 01:23:47.410]  Hey, Josh, can you check me, make sure I'm on the right?
[01:23:47.410 --> 01:23:48.530]  Yes, you did.
[01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:49.650]  Okay, cool.
[01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:50.490]  Thanks.
[01:23:54.170 --> 01:23:56.290]  I've got about 25 of the PAMs
[01:23:56.290 --> 01:23:58.090]  that are about to flip to flower
[01:23:58.090 --> 01:24:00.770]  in the next five to seven days.
[01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:03.410]  And I plan on putting the rural cush
[01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:06.810]  and Duke Diamonds Munson males into it this year.
[01:24:07.890 --> 01:24:11.690]  It is a, first of all, Tyler is just a genius.
[01:24:11.690 --> 01:24:14.570]  I mean, outside of breeding, he's a tree doctor.
[01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:18.250]  I mean, he focuses on orchards and things like that.
[01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:21.610]  But this plant, and he's so accessible.
[01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:23.210]  You send him a message on anything,
[01:24:23.650 --> 01:24:25.290]  he's there to talk to you on selections.
[01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:29.330]  But this plant where it is standalone to me,
[01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:32.370]  dealing with animals and dogs, particularly in breeding,
[01:24:32.370 --> 01:24:34.450]  that gives me genetic opportunities
[01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:35.930]  to really open things up,
[01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:38.210]  especially if I wanted to do a back cross
[01:24:38.210 --> 01:24:39.290]  to put that in there
[01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:41.850]  and then back cross into the other line.
[01:24:43.450 --> 01:24:45.290]  So I'm excited about the PAM Anderson
[01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:49.610]  more so than anything I've got growing right now.
[01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:52.050]  And I wanna say that this is a funny story.
[01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:54.610]  There we go, kicking it off,
[01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:56.410]  G unit kicking it off with 300.
[01:24:57.370 --> 01:25:01.130]  The dude, when he caught like my heart,
[01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:02.650]  I meet a lot of people in these conferences,
[01:25:02.650 --> 01:25:04.650]  but he's like, we connected on the dog walker
[01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:06.290]  and you passed out, Kev.
[01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:10.170]  And so he got into one of those competitions
[01:25:10.170 --> 01:25:11.730]  where they pass out the clone
[01:25:11.730 --> 01:25:14.330]  and they don't tell you what it is
[01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:15.170]  that you were involved with.
[01:25:15.170 --> 01:25:16.730]  I can't remember the name of that competition.
[01:25:16.730 --> 01:25:17.570]  The Grow Off.
[01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:18.410]  The Grow Off, yeah.
[01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:20.130]  So he got involved with that.
[01:25:20.130 --> 01:25:22.930]  And he won the Grow Off in Southern California
[01:25:22.930 --> 01:25:24.490]  with a dog walker pet.
[01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:27.330]  And the story of actually how he won
[01:25:27.330 --> 01:25:30.450]  and the actual herb that he sent in,
[01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:32.170]  that he didn't know it was a dog walker at the time,
[01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:34.010]  but he got fucked up in some shit
[01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:36.130]  where his bathroom blew apart
[01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:38.290]  in the middle of the grow, the end of the grow.
[01:25:38.290 --> 01:25:40.610]  And he had to have the whole house remodeled.
[01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:42.370]  And so he finished the grow
[01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:45.690]  and he had to dry it in a hotel
[01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:47.970]  and in his car with his whole family
[01:25:47.970 --> 01:25:49.490]  and like crammed in some hotel.
[01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:52.450]  When they'd leave, he'd run it out to the car
[01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:55.010]  and he did some sort of fucking crazy cure job
[01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:57.210]  between the hotel and his car
[01:25:57.210 --> 01:25:59.170]  and he won the Grow Off with it.
[01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:00.690]  And I was laughing my ass off.
[01:26:00.690 --> 01:26:02.850]  I was like, dude, that dog walker is so strong.
[01:26:02.850 --> 01:26:03.850]  I totally believe it.
[01:26:03.850 --> 01:26:05.970]  But like, that's the type of grower he is
[01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:07.650]  that he can fucking win a competition
[01:26:07.650 --> 01:26:10.770]  with some weed he's drying on the fly
[01:26:10.770 --> 01:26:12.930]  in between the hotel.
[01:26:12.930 --> 01:26:15.210]  And he's a cool dude, man.
[01:26:15.210 --> 01:26:16.050]  And he's a really-
[01:26:16.050 --> 01:26:16.890]  He is, man.
[01:26:16.890 --> 01:26:17.730]  He's a great guy.
[01:26:18.730 --> 01:26:20.570]  I met him at the conference too
[01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:23.610]  and he just stood really smart, nice dude.
[01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:28.330]  And that's the thing is there's a lot of bright people
[01:26:28.330 --> 01:26:30.410]  in the world, but bright and cool,
[01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:32.850]  bright and kind don't always go together.
[01:26:32.850 --> 01:26:36.010]  There's sometimes linkage drag
[01:26:36.010 --> 01:26:37.970]  where those things move forward in the line
[01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:39.450]  and sometimes they're not dragged
[01:26:39.450 --> 01:26:40.970]  and they don't move forward.
[01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:42.370]  And he's cool.
[01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:47.350]  So where are we at with it?
[01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:48.710]  Are we still at the 300?
[01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:51.230]  Yep.
[01:26:53.150 --> 01:26:54.830]  I would hop on these.
[01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:56.230]  I mean, as far as I understand,
[01:26:56.230 --> 01:26:57.870]  he's not gonna release these at all.
[01:26:57.870 --> 01:26:58.910]  So this is a one and-
[01:26:58.910 --> 01:27:01.430]  No, no, this is limited release.
[01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:02.270]  Yeah.
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:14.940]  And there, I can even talk you through the selection too.
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:19.220]  They're super gassy and there's the one that he prefers
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:21.220]  has a red stem from the beginning.
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.820]  So it's actually a real easy one to sift through
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:26.980]  if you're looking for his selection.
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:31.060]  There we got Tam O'Hara for 350.
[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:31.900]  Thank you, sir.
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.280]  Yeah, they're gonna dig him.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:45.720]  G-Unit came with 375 right then.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:46.560]  Woo.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.640]  I do the G-Unit stuff,
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.600]  but I don't know how to pull that off.
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.520]  I do, but I'm not gonna do it.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.520]  Go ahead, Cass Gagan, go ahead.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.920]  Break that down.
[01:28:11.490 --> 01:28:13.450]  All right, we gotta push that 375.
[01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:14.330]  Come on, guys.
[01:28:15.610 --> 01:28:17.450]  This is for a fucking good cause.
[01:28:17.450 --> 01:28:18.410]  And it's-
[01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:19.250]  I wanna-
[01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:20.290]  How many are in there?
[01:28:20.290 --> 01:28:21.130]  What do you say, 25?
[01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:21.970]  There's 25 in there.
[01:28:21.970 --> 01:28:22.810]  We got 400.
[01:28:22.810 --> 01:28:23.650]  Thanks, Tam.
[01:28:23.650 --> 01:28:24.650]  Killer, killer.
[01:28:24.650 --> 01:28:27.010]  So yeah, his process with,
[01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:29.970]  I wanna say the other thing
[01:28:29.970 --> 01:28:32.090]  that takes it from being a soilless medium,
[01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:33.290]  back to Delano,
[01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:34.810]  from being a soilless medium,
[01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:36.570]  which he can offer and make,
[01:28:36.570 --> 01:28:38.130]  to an actual soil,
[01:28:38.130 --> 01:28:41.050]  is that he throws in the minerals, the clay.
[01:28:41.050 --> 01:28:44.090]  And it's not just a simple thing.
[01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:46.730]  There's been a lot of conversation about basalts
[01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:51.010]  and getting the granite in there and stuff like that.
[01:28:51.010 --> 01:28:54.810]  But he started talking to me about blue and red.
[01:28:54.810 --> 01:28:58.290]  And it not being as much about the source,
[01:28:58.290 --> 01:29:02.530]  but the regional sources of the blue and the red,
[01:29:02.530 --> 01:29:06.250]  that has the complexity together
[01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:07.770]  when you mix the two together,
[01:29:07.770 --> 01:29:08.970]  but you find it in your region.
[01:29:08.970 --> 01:29:11.170]  And he was all about using the resources
[01:29:11.170 --> 01:29:12.370]  within your region.
[01:29:12.370 --> 01:29:14.090]  So he was, he's like,
[01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:15.010]  what's on your property?
[01:29:15.010 --> 01:29:16.410]  I'm like, oh, it's all red.
[01:29:16.410 --> 01:29:18.090]  It's all tannish type clay.
[01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:21.170]  And he's like, well, you gotta go get some more blue to add.
[01:29:21.170 --> 01:29:22.770]  I think he started talking about me,
[01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:24.290]  think through where that is gonna be at.
[01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:26.530]  So we're at 500, the silent one.
[01:29:26.530 --> 01:29:27.370]  Thank you.
[01:29:27.370 --> 01:29:28.850]  550, G.U. and NET.
[01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:31.850]  Damn, G.U. is not playing.
[01:29:31.850 --> 01:29:32.690]  Honcho, no.
[01:29:32.690 --> 01:29:33.530]  No, I ran out of time.
[01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:34.370]  I was at 600.
[01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:37.850]  Time's up, but we'll let the snipe roll.
[01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:39.690]  The silent one at 600.
[01:29:42.170 --> 01:29:43.010]  Nice.
[01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:48.490]  Man, this cake stuff, I'm really getting into.
[01:29:48.490 --> 01:29:51.530]  I have to say like everyone's,
[01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:55.170]  it's cake crosses everywhere I go in the retail market.
[01:29:55.170 --> 01:29:56.850]  Everyone's working cake shit.
[01:29:59.170 --> 01:30:01.770]  I'm smoking some regular wedding cake here.
[01:30:01.810 --> 01:30:03.970]  And it tastes to me kind of similar
[01:30:04.890 --> 01:30:06.850]  to that Mac you passed me, Kev.
[01:30:07.930 --> 01:30:10.170]  In the sense that it's real creamy and sweet
[01:30:10.170 --> 01:30:11.850]  and not really strong in anything.
[01:30:11.850 --> 01:30:15.290]  Just it's like real creamy, but I really enjoy it.
[01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:18.170]  Which is, you know, and for most people's palate,
[01:30:18.170 --> 01:30:19.130]  that's what they want.
[01:30:19.130 --> 01:30:23.370]  Like, I mean, I like some shit that just fucking grabs you.
[01:30:23.370 --> 01:30:24.210]  Yeah.
[01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:27.850]  But I know that I'm not the total market.
[01:30:27.850 --> 01:30:29.170]  If I had one of those,
[01:30:29.210 --> 01:30:30.690]  I would be the total market.
[01:30:30.690 --> 01:30:31.530]  And so the cake-
[01:30:31.530 --> 01:30:33.850]  If I had Dog Walker right here,
[01:30:33.850 --> 01:30:35.650]  I would never have noticed how cool this is,
[01:30:35.650 --> 01:30:37.250]  but I've been smoking it for a minute
[01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:38.090]  and now I'm noticing how cool it is.
[01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:39.810]  Yeah, no, once you burn it for a bit,
[01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:42.170]  especially, you know, the problem is,
[01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:44.690]  is that a lot of these things that are popular,
[01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:47.330]  what you're getting is you're getting commercially grown dope
[01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:49.050]  when you buy it, right?
[01:30:49.050 --> 01:30:51.090]  So the work doesn't go into it.
[01:30:51.090 --> 01:30:54.890]  But if you're putting the work in on the production,
[01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:59.130]  there's subtleties that come out that are nice.
[01:30:59.970 --> 01:31:04.170]  You know, you just have to find the balance within it.
[01:31:04.170 --> 01:31:06.690]  The variety that, if it's that popular,
[01:31:06.690 --> 01:31:09.090]  there has to be something of value to it.
[01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:10.930]  It can't be fad.
[01:31:10.930 --> 01:31:12.690]  Fads don't last years.
[01:31:13.810 --> 01:31:16.290]  And the cake shit's been hot for a minute.
[01:31:16.290 --> 01:31:19.650]  You know, like right now, ice cream cake is fucking-
[01:31:19.650 --> 01:31:20.890]  I just, I have it.
[01:31:20.890 --> 01:31:22.770]  I've got it cloned out.
[01:31:22.770 --> 01:31:25.050]  I'm not sure if it's the real one yet.
[01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:26.970]  You know, I don't know what the real one is,
[01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:31.770]  but morphologically it looks like it's in the pocket,
[01:31:31.770 --> 01:31:32.970]  in the corner, you know?
[01:31:34.210 --> 01:31:35.050]  So-
[01:31:35.050 --> 01:31:37.050]  Well, you got access though, you know what I'm saying?
[01:31:37.050 --> 01:31:40.290]  So for that one, we got Gene in it at 550.
[01:31:42.010 --> 01:31:44.970]  I'd say a 600 P win, 600.
[01:31:46.170 --> 01:31:47.610]  No, that was a mistake.
[01:31:47.610 --> 01:31:48.450]  That was-
[01:31:48.450 --> 01:31:49.290]  Oh, excuse me.
[01:31:49.290 --> 01:31:52.690]  That was somebody else pushing for 600.
[01:31:53.650 --> 01:31:54.490]  Gotcha.
[01:31:57.090 --> 01:31:57.930]  Who was that again?
[01:31:57.930 --> 01:31:59.090]  So I can write it down.
[01:31:59.090 --> 01:32:00.290]  550.
[01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:01.530]  G-Unit.
[01:32:01.530 --> 01:32:02.770]  G-Unit.
[01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:05.050]  And so you can just hit me up.
[01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:07.170]  The last two ones, the one for Olfactory
[01:32:07.170 --> 01:32:10.250]  and the one for the Pam,
[01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:14.370]  hit me up on that in my Instagram, Dutch Blooms.
[01:32:14.370 --> 01:32:15.970]  And then I can make that happen.
[01:32:17.130 --> 01:32:20.530]  Next up, I will offer my donation.
[01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:24.930]  I was looking through the last couple of conversations,
[01:32:24.930 --> 01:32:26.170]  two genetics came up
[01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:29.730]  and I happened to have made a cross between two of them.
[01:32:29.730 --> 01:32:31.570]  So I thought there might be some interest,
[01:32:31.570 --> 01:32:34.050]  but the TK has been coming up a lot
[01:32:34.050 --> 01:32:39.050]  and the TKG13 hash plant specifically came up.
[01:32:39.170 --> 01:32:42.650]  And so I was gifted seeds from BioTim,
[01:32:42.650 --> 01:32:46.410]  who is a rep for Bio365 Soil,
[01:32:46.410 --> 01:32:49.610]  which is a really cool indoor soil company.
[01:32:51.170 --> 01:32:52.570]  I know we're doing a thing for Delano,
[01:32:52.570 --> 01:32:54.090]  but I got to shut them out for sure.
[01:32:54.090 --> 01:32:56.290]  They sent me a pallet and it's good stuff.
[01:32:56.290 --> 01:32:57.130]  Oh, he's cool, man.
[01:32:57.130 --> 01:32:58.130]  He just hit me up.
[01:32:58.130 --> 01:32:59.570]  He's a real fucking cool dude.
[01:32:59.570 --> 01:33:02.330]  And he just hit me up and left a message, man.
[01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:03.370]  He's a cool dude.
[01:33:03.370 --> 01:33:04.210]  Yeah, I wouldn't mind.
[01:33:04.210 --> 01:33:05.050]  I wouldn't mind.
[01:33:05.050 --> 01:33:06.210]  I'm gonna start Matt so I can pop this off.
[01:33:06.210 --> 01:33:07.050]  I wouldn't mind.
[01:33:07.050 --> 01:33:08.090]  I wouldn't mind playing with some stuff
[01:33:08.090 --> 01:33:11.050]  just on a small little side up.
[01:33:11.050 --> 01:33:11.890]  Check it out.
[01:33:11.890 --> 01:33:13.010]  Yeah, well, he's been breeding for a while
[01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:15.730]  and he actually had a 502 license here in Washington.
[01:33:15.730 --> 01:33:18.610]  And a cat that worked for me for a minute
[01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:20.050]  was following him on Instagram
[01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:22.050]  and linked us up and then he kind of decided
[01:33:22.050 --> 01:33:23.730]  that he wanted to go the soil route.
[01:33:23.730 --> 01:33:26.490]  And, you know, but so he's been breeding for a long time
[01:33:26.490 --> 01:33:27.770]  and he hit me up with those seeds.
[01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:30.290]  And so I picked two males
[01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:32.170]  and I put them on a bunch of stuff this winter,
[01:33:32.170 --> 01:33:33.130]  just like, let's do it.
[01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:37.090]  And one of those in there was the Ethiopian from Joel.
[01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:42.250]  So it's a TKG13 hash plant male,
[01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:46.570]  two males on top of the Ethiopian female from Joel.
[01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:51.010]  So I haven't tested them at all,
[01:33:51.010 --> 01:33:52.650]  but it's good stock.
[01:33:52.650 --> 01:33:55.650]  And the stuff I have tested from the Ethiopian
[01:33:55.650 --> 01:33:58.290]  that I've crossed into is fucking solid.
[01:33:58.290 --> 01:34:01.090]  I actually posted a pic this morning
[01:34:01.090 --> 01:34:03.930]  up on the House of Selection site we just started
[01:34:03.930 --> 01:34:06.970]  of a Sky Cuddler Kush cross the Ethiopian.
[01:34:06.970 --> 01:34:09.970]  And it's just, I actually had it confused.
[01:34:09.970 --> 01:34:12.130]  I thought it was somebody else's.
[01:34:12.130 --> 01:34:14.850]  And I was just like, damn, dude's fucking representing.
[01:34:14.850 --> 01:34:16.530]  He's crushing my garden, you know?
[01:34:17.370 --> 01:34:18.890]  And then it was a tagging mistake.
[01:34:18.890 --> 01:34:22.290]  When I sorted it out, I was like, oh, I made that shit.
[01:34:22.290 --> 01:34:23.370]  Holy hell.
[01:34:25.090 --> 01:34:26.930]  Well, aren't I a fucking cool, you know?
[01:34:28.170 --> 01:34:29.970]  But it's really just the climate thing, you know,
[01:34:29.970 --> 01:34:33.570]  the plants getting used to my soil and fucking crushing.
[01:34:33.570 --> 01:34:36.090]  But it's good shit and really thick, big.
[01:34:36.090 --> 01:34:39.130]  You know, it has that Itau fucking big thing coming through.
[01:34:39.130 --> 01:34:42.290]  So that's my intro to what it is.
[01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:47.290]  Um, yeah, let's start it out at a hundred bucks
[01:34:47.410 --> 01:34:49.450]  and I'll put up 25 seeds, you know?
[01:34:50.410 --> 01:34:51.250]  Let's do 50.
[01:34:51.250 --> 01:34:52.650]  Let's start at a hundred and do 50 seeds
[01:34:52.650 --> 01:34:54.890]  so you can get a good look at it.
[01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:56.010]  50 seeds?
[01:34:56.010 --> 01:34:56.850]  Yeah.
[01:34:56.850 --> 01:34:57.690]  That's killer.
[01:35:00.450 --> 01:35:03.490]  Yeah, no, because the thing was that Ethiopian,
[01:35:03.490 --> 01:35:05.850]  remember when we burned some Ethiopian
[01:35:05.850 --> 01:35:09.450]  that you had grown out from Itau?
[01:35:09.450 --> 01:35:12.810]  Well, it wasn't, that was the weed he gave me
[01:35:12.810 --> 01:35:14.690]  that I had found the seed in.
[01:35:14.690 --> 01:35:15.650]  Boom.
[01:35:15.650 --> 01:35:18.210]  And it was, it reminded me of that Cambodian
[01:35:18.210 --> 01:35:22.890]  where it had this really funky high, just clear and clean,
[01:35:22.890 --> 01:35:27.650]  but it would, it'll add frame to the TKG13.
[01:35:27.650 --> 01:35:29.650]  It'll open up that size.
[01:35:29.650 --> 01:35:30.810]  It's big and robust.
[01:35:30.810 --> 01:35:33.130]  And I run it here, just the straight Ethiopian.
[01:35:33.130 --> 01:35:34.370]  You know, I have a ton of cuts of it.
[01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:35.570]  I run it indoor and kind of,
[01:35:35.570 --> 01:35:38.170]  I've been messing with it a bunch to be honest.
[01:35:38.170 --> 01:35:41.330]  And it's, they can't run outdoor here, you know,
[01:35:41.330 --> 01:35:43.130]  but I was able to make seeds on it, you know,
[01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:45.450]  type of thing and run that.
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.520]  Joe from Itau Foundation Seeds.
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:54.760]  We've got the Lime Valley Rural Kuhish Platinum Pie,
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:57.160]  seven of them outdoors in two separate locations
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:58.000]  in Michigan.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.440]  I got two properties, 20 minutes from each other.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.600]  They're out producing everything this year.
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:08.240]  I have never seen something with this much hybrid vigor.
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:11.840]  I am stupidly impressed with the plants
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.920]  that we put out from him this year.
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:17.280]  And also they were the first to trigger,
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.760]  they're week three in flower right now here in Michigan.
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:22.960]  And some of my things haven't even triggered yet.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:27.480]  The rural limes is probably the other plant
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:30.480]  I'm most impressed with as far as outdoor growth this year.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.160]  Skittles to rural Kuhish Black Lime Reserve
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.840]  from the Mountain.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:38.000]  Also just triggered and is really setting flower on,
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:42.160]  but I have never seen the hybrid vigor out of plants
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:44.720]  as I see out of Itau Foundation's plants.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:46.360]  And I've cracked, I don't know,
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:47.960]  five, six different strains of his
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:50.440]  at this point over the last year.
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:51.520]  So big ups to Joe.
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:52.960]  I don't know what the hell you're doing,
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.600]  but good Lord, it is working.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:57.400]  It is definitely working, man.
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:58.240]  So.
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:00.280]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:02.040]  I had the same thing, you know,
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:04.680]  I had the same thing and everyone's stuff
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:06.320]  does a little different stuff.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:09.400]  I've been popping a lot of numbers this year
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.560]  and I've spent a lot of time with different breeders
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:15.120]  over the last two years, Joel and Jackson, for real,
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:18.840]  like thousands of seeds of both those dudes, thousands.
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:22.440]  And Joel's fucking jump up and run.
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.160]  Jackson's don't jump up and run as much,
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:25.840]  but they ended up putting on a bigger leaf
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:28.600]  and ended up having a little bit more grease
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.040]  in the flavor profile that I get down with.
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:33.120]  And so I'm crossing that fucking shit up,
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:35.800]  makes the most sense, right?
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:41.160]  How'd those lime cherries that I gave you turn out?
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.400]  Those are next up, man.
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:43.840]  So I got those all potted up.
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.720]  They're gonna take the center row in my greenhouse
[01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:47.900]  in the next week they're going in.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.400]  I'm really excited about those.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:53.400]  I've been talking to Jackson about those.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.360]  I'm pulling some other stuff with the lime in it,
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.780]  the Lime Pop Kush, Cross Sky Jaro.
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:02.560]  Obviously the Testarossa Black Lime Reserve has it in there,
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.240]  but as we're talking about flavors and stuff,
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:06.640]  it was cool where I'm able to sort it out.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:07.840]  I think I'm gonna be able to put
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:10.240]  a really cool lime flavor together
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:11.800]  at the end of it with all this shit.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.800]  However I mix it up, one way or the other,
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.440]  it's gonna be fucking cool, man.
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:19.560]  Yeah, because Jackson had given me a cherry back frost
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.960]  that he didn't want me to release in clonal form
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.320]  because he said it was just too close to his work.
[01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.280]  So I said, no worries.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.440]  I said, I'll just keep it in house.
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:31.480]  And then what I'll do is we'll use it in hybrids.
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:33.920]  And so that cherry seven was like this really,
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.560]  that was the number seven was the selection.
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:40.540]  The flavor was like a burnt cherry.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:44.160]  It made me think I was at an expensive restaurant
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:46.360]  and they had given me like a cherry souffle.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.080]  And then my buddy, old Ben from Willis,
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:55.400]  a legendary gangster out of that region,
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:56.760]  him and Gene are buddies too.
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:59.120]  And he had a lime from Gene that Gene had kicked him,
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.760]  the straight lime lime.
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:02.800]  And so me and Ben were hanging out and I said,
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:03.920]  hey, I got the cherry seven.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:05.040]  He goes, I got the lime.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.420]  I said, hey, let's lay them together
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:11.000]  and we'll have our own version of cherry limeade,
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.640]  so to speak, but not his.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:14.240]  And then we'll just hold it in house
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:15.920]  and we'll release it limited.
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.680]  So you're the only one that has those seeds.
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:19.720]  That's fucking cool, dude.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:20.560]  They never-
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:21.380]  You didn't release them to anybody else.
[01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:22.220]  Let me see this fuck, I mean.
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:23.280]  You didn't know they got them.
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.120]  Yeah, they'll be good.
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.720]  Well, they popped hard too
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:28.560]  cause you were talking about your popping technique.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:30.400]  And I wanted the comment saying,
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.480]  the reason why those fucking things pop so hard
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:35.860]  is because they were grown for seed.
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:37.840]  And that's what you see with,
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:40.200]  and that's why like when I tell people about crack and seed,
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:41.840]  I'm like, trust me,
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:44.880]  not all breeders put that level of work in
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:47.680]  to getting it to where the seed is fully viable.
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.360]  But that was a good project
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.820]  and I can't wait to see what you pop out of it.
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:54.860]  I'm really excited, man.
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:57.480]  I ended up putting three seeds per,
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:01.400]  I don't know what the fuck these things are.
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:02.480]  They're half gallons.
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:04.200]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.200]  I just crammed them in there.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.680]  And then so I pulled tarp on them for three days.
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:10.800]  And so I'm waiting to see sex
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:12.840]  and then I'll pull my males.
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:14.960]  Cause they're greasy enough, dude.
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.640]  I can smell through them.
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:18.120]  As I'll pull my males and clone them
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:19.520]  and then I'll just plant all my females
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:22.280]  right in that center row and I'll get a big look at it.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:25.800]  And I have a swath of full terms going.
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.360]  Cause you gave them to me and I popped some right away
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.520]  and then I put some direct in the ground
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:32.440]  and then I thought about it.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.760]  I was like, okay, here, let's time this out.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:37.360]  And I timed it out for coming to my next run
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.320]  to get a good look at it.
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:40.820]  So thank you very much, dude.
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:42.480]  I'm super fucking stoked.
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:44.520]  No, you're welcome.
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:48.260]  That cherry pie was, he found a seed in a bag of cherry pie
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:50.480]  that he uses for all his work.
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.880]  And then he took it into a Bubba,
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.300]  I think like a Bubba male.
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:57.320]  And then he back crossed it multiple times.
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:01.920]  So really it's like, you know, seven, eight pure cherry pie.
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.680]  And then when I ran all the seed out,
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:05.960]  they were really consistent.
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:08.520]  Morphologically speaking, very similar.
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:13.520]  I just really liked that thick burnt cherry smell.
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.320]  It just was, it was just unique.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:17.480]  Cause I love cherry pie, but it's the cherry pie.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.980]  I have that the same cut.
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:23.720]  It's brighter and more fruity.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:26.080]  It doesn't have the burnt aroma to it.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.160]  But that burnt aroma is just in the mouth.
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:29.000]  It's just.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.160]  Yeah, that sounds cool.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:31.840]  And that's, and it's, we talked to Jackson.
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:34.160]  I talked about it's a different than I did bag of seed
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:36.920]  of cherry pie too, that I won that tour festival
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:38.120]  with when we met.
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:38.960]  Yes.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:40.760]  But it was a different version of that
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:41.720]  because it was bag seed, right?
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.840]  And so mine was more crustier
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:45.480]  and that's where I leaned towards with,
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.360]  Hey, there's Tyler.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.080]  But I was my pie hoe was I leaned
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.960]  towards that butter crust on the cherry pie
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:53.680]  that I had experienced in the bag seed I popped
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:55.200]  and done well with.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.720]  Cause I got the real cherry pie.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:58.560]  If you ever need a copy of it, you know what I mean?
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:01.640]  I would love to see what it is
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:02.480]  compared to what I was bag seed.
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:05.080]  I got a couple of whoppers in the yard, man.
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.000]  I'll, yeah, I got some good size ones.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:09.360]  Cause it comes in early.
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:12.520]  Comes in before October.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:15.560]  To me, like the experience has been so awesome for me
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:16.800]  is to see so much stuff.
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:19.720]  And cause I don't, you know, I don't have the decades
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.680]  of experience or whatever the time that like someone
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:25.600]  like Jackson has, but I'm able to see a lot
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.280]  in what I'm able to grow right now.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.320]  And it's been really cool.
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:30.520]  And it's just a pure bliss, man.
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:32.280]  Totally.
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:34.200]  You got talent though, man.
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.040]  You got talent.
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:35.880]  You got real talent.
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:36.760]  You can't deny it.
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:39.480]  So.
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:43.760]  So speak, speaking of real talent, who won this?
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:48.400]  Soviet smokers, 710 won with a bid of 425.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:49.240]  Oh, nice.
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:50.080]  Thank you.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:50.920]  Beautiful.
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:53.720]  And so we're going to rewind.
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:57.160]  Someone already won these, but we have the man behind
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:00.680]  some seeds.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.520]  So.
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:02.360]  Oh, the Pam Anderson.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:03.200]  Tyler's here.
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:04.040]  Yeah.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:07.280]  Or did we lose him?
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.120]  Did he go away?
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:09.360]  I think we lost him.
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:10.200]  I think we lost him.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:12.560]  Anyway, he'll come back.
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:14.480]  Nick, so the next one is up to you, bro.
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.560]  I think that you were going to donate some, something.
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:18.480]  I won't say what it is.
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:20.200]  I'll let you talk about it, dude.
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:25.120]  Yeah, so I took a lime belly rural cush to a rural seven
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:28.040]  from, from Kennead Eagle trees.
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:30.800]  For people who don't know me, rural,
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:33.720]  I've got a port in my chest connected to my heart.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:38.120]  Rural cush is a major medical strain for me
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:43.040]  and is the reason I'm, I'm, I'm functioning neurologically.
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:44.400]  So rural is my baby.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.600]  I have probably cracked about 5,000 rural seeds
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:49.040]  in the last two, three years.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:52.640]  So I took Kenny's a long Valley rural cush
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:56.880]  across to rural seven into Emerald mountains rural 10.
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:01.320]  And then I crossed that into a lime Valley,
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:04.520]  lime Valley rural cushion to rural eight from root wise.
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:08.160]  So that's a lot of rural jammed into different selections
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:10.040]  over the last 14 months.
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.320]  I've never released it.
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:15.000]  Actually for the first time this week, I sent it to,
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.640]  I sent 13 seeds to micro balkanist
[01:44:17.640 --> 01:44:19.880]  and 13 out to dungeon ball genetics.
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:23.320]  But other than that, I've never given it to anybody.
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.840]  So I figured I'd throw a 13 seeds of that into this auction.
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.360]  I only, I have a limited supply on that breed
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.720]  and I can start that off at a hundred dollars.
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:33.680]  And,
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:35.520]  Can we, can we type in what it is?
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:37.600]  Like, can we name it or put something?
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:42.120]  Yeah, it's a, if I can try to type that out right here
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:47.120]  on the other phone, it's a long Valley rural cush
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:51.880]  from affection auto to Royal seven
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:58.880]  cross the roll cush 10 cross to lime Valley rural cush
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:12.280]  cross Royal eight from root wise.
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:13.640]  So it's all rural cush.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.640]  It's just different people's selection
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:19.480]  of the rural cush sling together.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:22.840]  I post some pictures on my Facebook the other day of it.
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:25.160]  I've cut down the leaf structure of the Royal
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:26.640]  with this selection.
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:27.720]  It's not as leafy.
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:29.800]  It's not as thick with leaf in it.
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:33.000]  You've got a lot more calyx to leaf ratio.
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.640]  It's a shown stupid trichome at week three.
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:40.400]  We've got about, we have some in flower.
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:41.760]  We're on a plant count.
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:44.720]  So we have 12 in flower right now
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:47.000]  and they all look beautiful.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.920]  I posted four or five different pictures of the day.
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:53.080]  I started working on this about 18 months ago
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:55.000]  and I'm still not done with it.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.280]  I plan on putting Joel's selection of Royal into it
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:01.280]  and a Dr. Green skies selection of Royal into it.
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:07.560]  But it's a LBRK to Royal seven cross to Royal 10
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:10.320]  cross the long Valley rural cush to Royal eight.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:12.520]  So just all rural cush.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:16.280]  Just like most Royals inbred.
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:17.720]  I think that's amazing.
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:21.360]  But I mean, I really cut down on the leaf ratio
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:24.080]  and a trait that I didn't want
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:26.520]  but others are gonna extremely like
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:31.520]  is about 35% of them are popping pure strawberry phenos.
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:32.560]  Really?
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:35.840]  I like that more chemical gas from Royal.
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:38.600]  But you know, used to I'd get one out of a hundred
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:40.280]  that strawberry raspberry.
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:42.720]  It's more like raspberries than strawberry
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:45.240]  that that Royal cush pheno that.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:48.200]  But now I'm getting it four out of 10,
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:49.040]  three and a half.
[01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:50.440]  Is that the long Valley that's putting it in there
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:51.280]  you think?
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.160]  I know.
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:56.440]  I think it's Kenny selection, honestly.
[01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:58.360]  Kenny selection has that in there.
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:00.600]  Yeah, I think it's Kenny selection there.
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:04.000]  Do what now?
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:04.840]  Regular?
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:07.160]  Oh yeah, all my stuff is regular man.
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:08.600]  It's regular.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:13.920]  And you're gonna pull a lot of strawberry phenos out there
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:15.240]  when normally out of Royal,
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:17.280]  you're gonna pull a lot more of
[01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:19.680]  and for the older people in there,
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:23.400]  you remember those, those perms in the 1980s,
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:26.120]  your mom and your aunts would get like at home
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:28.920]  and it would have this chemical smell that is,
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:30.320]  yeah, look at it.
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:33.240]  There was extremely, I mean,
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:36.280]  I can remember this smell of those home perms
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:37.720]  that they would do.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:39.600]  And that's what the Royal Kush,
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.320]  the phenol that I want the most out of it smells like,
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:46.640]  but it's a mixture of that and strawberry
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.960]  and it is a very fermented strawberry.
[01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:51.680]  So it's a wild smell there.
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:53.720]  I'm really enjoying the,
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:55.600]  if you check out my Instagram,
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:57.360]  you'll see what I'm talking about.
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.720]  I was just gonna say like,
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:02.480]  just to prop you up a bit,
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:06.440]  you know this fucking plant better than most people.
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:09.480]  Guaranteed.
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:10.440]  And you know it from,
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.840]  not only from a growing perspective,
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:15.000]  but from like a mass consumption,
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.920]  like no one else does.
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.200]  Like literally,
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:21.480]  you consumed more of this in RSO and in flower
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.360]  probably than anybody else,
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:24.960]  definitely in RSO.
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:26.720]  And so the selection,
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:29.320]  I just, I think that adds to the selection you made
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:30.160]  in the, you know,
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:32.280]  as you were going through and add this different stuff,
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:34.080]  you were looking for something
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.520]  and it was your own personal need,
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:40.840]  which is seizures and antiviral really.
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:42.880]  So.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:46.160]  Yeah, I don't know many people that can sell you seeds
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:47.520]  that are, you know,
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:48.480]  that I can say in there,
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:51.720]  that there is a ton of hope in those seeds.
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:56.720]  Like for other Lyme disease and tick-borne parasitic people
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:01.240]  that have developed that,
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:03.520]  the neuroadulant ostomy that comes through
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:05.080]  are anti-parasitic.
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:10.920]  You know, replace antibiotics in a lot of forms.
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:11.760]  I mean, like I said,
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:14.600]  I have a permanent port in my chest
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:16.400]  connected to my heart that sticks out
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:18.680]  and I'm off all pharmaceuticals at this point.
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:20.720]  Rural Kush, Pure Kush.
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:24.560]  And then I experiment with different MAC strains
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:26.400]  for the morning to wake me up and stuff.
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:31.400]  But that is my main medicine structure.
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:33.800]  But it goes way deeper than that.
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.640]  There are, you gotta think of,
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.440]  we go back to where Kev talked about
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:39.920]  wanting to go to Africa earlier.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:42.400]  People over there have been treating malaria
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:46.080]  with marijuana for hundreds of years.
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:47.640]  And there are strains still there,
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:49.840]  like breaking down these different strains
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:53.560]  that you can find for medical structure.
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:57.200]  Rural Kush has been the most important one for me.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:59.480]  So that's the reason I went on this journey
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.640]  of smashing different people's selections of rural together
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:05.480]  because it's based off hope.
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.800]  And so far it's all working out, man.
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:12.560]  So I'm definitely, big props to Ben,
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:16.000]  Amanda Brott lives on, to Ariel,
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.080]  to the entire Emerald Mountain family,
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:20.760]  much love to you guys.
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:24.040]  So Kev, all the different people that held that cut,
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:25.640]  that kept it going.
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:29.560]  I found out about Rural Kush from Jackson
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:32.600]  and Kev and Shango Loves doing conversations
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:34.480]  talking about powdery mildew resistance.
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:37.880]  And I'm thinking if a plant has powdery mildew resistance
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:41.040]  and powdery mildew is attacking that plant like a parasite,
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.560]  is anchoring down past the epidural layer
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:47.280]  into the plant cells and hosting off that plant.
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:50.080]  If a plant can beat that back,
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:52.480]  then that unlocks the keys internally
[01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:54.960]  for me to be back all these parasites, bacteria
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:57.680]  and stuff that I have and multiple other people.
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:50:59.840]  And even into this COVID shit,
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:02.920]  which is viral and parasitic in nature.
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:06.320]  So the rural has definitely,
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:11.080]  it's a medical strain that's very close to my heart.
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:15.360]  Dude, you absolutely opened a door for a lot of people
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:19.600]  because you were the first person that I've ever met,
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:20.640]  ran across that said,
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:24.960]  hey, I'm gonna utilize these directions
[01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:28.080]  that help the plant survive.
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:30.840]  I'm gonna use it in human form.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:34.440]  And so it was just such a conceptual leap
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:39.000]  and hats off man, because it opened up the door
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.520]  for a lot of people to be able to say,
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:43.080]  hey, I can use cannabis in this way too.
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:44.200]  Because the bottom line is man,
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:45.920]  pharmaceuticals are ferocious.
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:48.240]  I'm a fucking hustler.
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:49.560]  And Richard Rubio.
[01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:51.000]  Come down to out-handed doctors,
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  $189,000 over a 13 month period to stay alive.
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:59.200]  And at some point I'm like, fuck this,
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:00.520]  I'm cutting out the middleman.
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:03.400]  I got researched by the NIH,
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:05.200]  I had access to their archives.
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:09.000]  It's all right there for anybody to go into on terpenes
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.960]  and all the research that the NIH, the CDC
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:17.280]  and the National Institute of Health has done since 1974.
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:19.640]  And you go through that, you start finding it out
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:20.840]  and you figure out that they know
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:24.360]  that ostamine and nirladol kill parasitic infections.
[01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:31.440]  It was based off desperation and the fact that,
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:34.360]  hey, I'm tired of giving these doctors all my fucking money
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:37.440]  and for them to experiment off me for them to get rich.
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:41.400]  And the antibiotics were fucking brutal.
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:42.560]  And at one point, man,
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:44.480]  and people find this hard to believe
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:46.880]  until I show them the actual medical stuff.
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:48.960]  They had me on 80 milligrams of Adderall,
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:50.800]  60 milligrams of Lortab,
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:53.120]  a thousand milligrams of Neurotin,
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:54.920]  eight different seizure medications
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:59.640]  and 71 antibiotics in one single day.
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:02.360]  Dude, I didn't know what the fuck was going on.
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:03.280]  I was sitting in my bedroom,
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:06.680]  just drooling on myself, watching cartoons over and over.
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:08.640]  And that was not the life for me.
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:10.440]  And anybody that,
[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:14.600]  there's people out there watching this shit that's sick,
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:17.080]  that have had to figure things out for themselves,
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:18.720]  they know what I'm talking about.
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:21.320]  I'm telling you, if you're sick right now
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:22.680]  and you're a cannabis consumer,
[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:25.440]  if you are not utilizing Royal Kush, Bubba Kush,
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:27.720]  Hollywood Pure Kush,
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:30.560]  these certain strains are proven
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:32.560]  and you get on the NIH's website,
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:34.120]  you type in your condition,
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:36.600]  you type in terpenes that fight that stuff,
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:38.920]  you will find linked, peer reviewed,
[01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:39.960]  researched articles,
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:42.360]  they just don't release it to the general public.
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.240]  And that information is there.
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:48.240]  And really, I just wanted to get better, man.
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:49.680]  I wanted to get back to training dogs.
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:51.320]  I wanted to get back to living life.
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:52.920]  And it's took a couple of years
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:56.800]  and I still have multiple freaking side effects daily.
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:58.560]  But this is the healthiest I've been.
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:01.360]  Kev, you saw me like at the Emerald Cup three years ago
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:03.680]  when I flew out there with doctors.
[01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:05.360]  I was drooling on myself,
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:07.800]  drooling on myself right out of a wheelchair.
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:10.880]  I'm up skipping around on two multiple properties,
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:12.280]  taking care of all these plants
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:15.920]  and that's the power of medical cannabis, RSO.
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:20.000]  Mushrooms, I don't wanna leave out mushrooms.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.680]  Cordyceps, reiki, lines, Maine, all that shit.
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:25.120]  All of that shit.
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:27.000]  If you are-
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.480]  Let's keep this rolling, Nick.
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:29.680]  I don't want to cut you off, dude.
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:30.800]  I wanna get, sorry, dude.
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:31.640]  I just wanna-
[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:32.480]  No, you're fine.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:34.080]  I get talking on medical and I get going.
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:35.240]  No, it's good, yeah.
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:37.240]  It's fucking amazing.
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:39.080]  And we had a winner here.
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:42.120]  So Richard Rubio, 300 bucks.
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:43.040]  Beautiful.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:44.800]  Thank you very much, dude.
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:46.360]  Thank you for putting those up.
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:48.960]  Nick, we are gonna talk about this a lot more.
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:51.400]  Hey, yo, to Rick, man, I've only gave those seeds out
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:53.520]  to two dudes ever.
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:56.160]  Like I said, Microbe Alchemist and Dungeon Vault
[01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:58.480]  and they're on the way there mail-wise.
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:00.440]  So the fact that you-
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:01.640]  And this is the base of what,
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:03.320]  base stuff that you're gonna be working with
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:05.480]  and a lot of the collab that we're doing
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:06.760]  in our house of selection.
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:10.640]  And I'm never ever gonna sell Roll Kush Pure
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:12.640]  because that's not my place to step in,
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:13.640]  Roll Mountain's place,
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.960]  but for auction stuff and for friends,
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:18.040]  I'll definitely give it out.
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:20.600]  But thank you very much and I appreciate that, man.
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.680]  Thank you very much, Nick, for donating
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:25.920]  and for like the research that you're doing,
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:27.600]  honestly, for the greater community.
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:29.000]  Kev touched on it, but like,
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:34.200]  it changes the fucking direction for a lot of people.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:39.200]  The Royal Seven, if you run it right,
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:44.280]  you're pulling like almost 29 numerically.
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:46.920]  We've seen it hit over seven on the Terps.
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:51.920]  A crew up in Oregon just clean house on it, Terp-wise,
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:53.680]  super resistance.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:56.040]  So it's the kind of stock that for most people,
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:57.960]  if they have a copy of it in their life,
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:55:59.560]  they're gonna get outdoor herb
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:01.560]  that's gonna be killer and indoor.
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:03.360]  So it makes you look smart, man.
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:06.760]  The selection that occurred prior to this wave,
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:09.440]  originally the work that was done by Mandel,
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:13.560]  he did a good job and this shit just held true.
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:15.960]  And so whoever picks the stock up, man, enjoy it.
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.560]  It's really good, it's excellent.
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:22.200]  The flavor profile's phenomenal, visual's beautiful.
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:24.120]  They've opened up the direction
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:25.600]  so you get more of that strawberry,
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:28.320]  but usually it was more like a musky grape,
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:30.600]  a little gas hit in the back,
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:32.560]  but just killer, killer stock.
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:37.360]  Before we get on to Tyler,
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:39.720]  I wanna do the next, get the next auction rolling.
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:41.400]  This is always my job at the conference,
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.520]  being the guy that's keeping shit rolling.
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:47.440]  So let's get the next auction rolling with Rebel Grown.
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:49.440]  He was on earlier, Dan the man.
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:55.440]  I think I got a bunch of stock that I sell out there.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:58.480]  I was talking to Regen Seaco and he was like,
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:00.360]  5G's purple, dude.
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:02.800]  He's like, 5G's purple, look at that one.
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:05.040]  That's some fucking serious,
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:07.760]  he's like, it's going for whatever.
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:13.880]  Anyways, the email he used on it was F13 cross Sour Diesel.
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:17.120]  Do you know what the F13 is, Kev?
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:20.840]  No, what was F13?
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:24.600]  I wanna say, wasn't F13 on like a DJ cross?
[01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:27.760]  See, it wasn't that it was, it has purple color to it,
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:30.000]  but he had, when he did his releases,
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.960]  the 5G stood for five grand
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:35.600]  because he believed that every pound sold at that shit
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:36.840]  should have went for 5G.
[01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:39.440]  So he had the 5G yellow.
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:48.440]  There was the 5G yellow, the 5G red, the 5G purple.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:50.880]  I've grown all of them.
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:52.760]  And this is like the exotic.
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:56.120]  So the 5G purple is where you get the exotic profiles.
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:59.080]  The 5G red was more like a Merlot wine.
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:04.080]  It had a reddish hue to it, but had a wine-like flavor.
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:09.240]  Put down 5G purple is the bag, right?
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:10.080]  Yep.
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:10.920]  Yep, that's what you wanna put down.
[01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:13.640]  5G purple, yep, I wanna put two bags down.
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:17.520]  Yeah, and so the quality of the smoke is rich,
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:19.640]  but the thing with Dan is he does beautiful work
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:20.960]  for outdoors, so everybody,
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.600]  because I used to recommend this shit like crazy
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:24.320]  because I was his dealer.
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:27.760]  And so we had, in terms of seed stock.
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:30.320]  And so the people that had just incredible success
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:33.480]  with these good fungal resistance,
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:36.480]  excellent exotic flavors,
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:39.520]  and the sour gives you some consistency in size.
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:40.920]  So we're doing 20 seeds?
[01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:44.360]  Yep, it's like 24 plus.
[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:45.920]  Usually guys say they're 10,
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:48.320]  but they end up being 12 to 14.
[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:51.520]  What's the mail on that, do you know?
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:55.000]  The mail is OG Chem cross C99,
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  cross an F2, BX1, IX2.
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:02.520]  Who knows where he went into all that?
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:03.920]  I don't understand all that.
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:06.680]  Kev knew a lot more about it than I did,
[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:09.080]  and he's run them all, so thanks for that, Kev.
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:12.640]  You wanna start it at?
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:15.080]  Let's start it at a hundred bucks.
[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:16.960]  They retail for a hundred bucks for one pack.
[01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:18.080]  We're doing two for a hundred.
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:21.280]  We'll start it there to get a good look at it.
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:22.440]  Okay, I got it running.
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:27.480]  And then with that, let's introduce Tyler, Mr. Tree.
[01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:28.880]  Thanks for hopping on, dude.
[01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:31.640]  You're muted, dude.
[01:59:44.910 --> 01:59:46.870]  You gotta hit the unmute button, Tyler.
[01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:48.910]  I guess you can't hear me when you try to explain,
[01:59:48.910 --> 01:59:50.910]  hit the unmute button.
[01:59:50.910 --> 01:59:51.750]  Sorry.
[01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:52.590]  Hey, there you go.
[01:59:52.590 --> 01:59:53.430]  What's up, bro?
[01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:54.270]  We can hear you now.
[01:59:54.270 --> 01:59:55.590]  There you go.
[01:59:55.590 --> 01:59:56.790]  There you go.
[01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:57.630]  What's up?
[01:59:57.630 --> 01:59:58.470]  Thanks for having me.
[01:59:58.510 --> 01:59:59.350]  Thanks for donating juice.
[01:59:59.350 --> 02:00:00.190]  I just got me out of the house there for a minute.
[02:00:00.190 --> 02:00:01.030]  I was cooking.
[02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:02.110]  Oh, right on, man.
[02:00:02.110 --> 02:00:02.950]  Right on, no worries.
[02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:05.110]  We got 350 for those PAMs.
[02:00:05.110 --> 02:00:07.350]  Do you wanna tell more about what they were?
[02:00:09.070 --> 02:00:10.350]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:00:10.350 --> 02:00:11.510]  Can you hear me without this?
[02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:13.030]  Do I need this thing in?
[02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:14.110]  Yeah, you're good.
[02:00:14.110 --> 02:00:15.350]  You hear me fine?
[02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:16.190]  You hear me good?
[02:00:16.190 --> 02:00:17.350]  Good, good.
[02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:21.870]  Basically, that PAM BX is unreleased.
[02:00:21.870 --> 02:00:23.950]  It was something that I made last season.
[02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:27.350]  Everybody that follows me kinda knows about the PAM,
[02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:29.350]  but the PAM is an old 90s bag seed
[02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:31.990]  that I've kept around forever.
[02:00:33.550 --> 02:00:38.550]  Years back, I decided when I got it tested with Phylos
[02:00:39.070 --> 02:00:42.070]  that it sat in the galaxy in a weird place
[02:00:42.070 --> 02:00:44.230]  that I would keep it around and I'd work with it
[02:00:44.230 --> 02:00:45.910]  until we figured out what it really was
[02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:47.510]  because I couldn't get a straight answer anywhere.
[02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:48.910]  And it was special to my heart.
[02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:52.390]  So I've kept it around for,
[02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:56.350]  it's going on seven years old, somewhere around there.
[02:00:56.470 --> 02:01:01.470]  The clone PAM one, it's a nasty, nasty skunk,
[02:01:02.190 --> 02:01:07.190]  musty wine, like berry profile to it.
[02:01:07.190 --> 02:01:12.190]  So early on in veg and early flower,
[02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:15.150]  and you got candy tones coming off that puppy
[02:01:16.230 --> 02:01:17.870]  like nobody's business.
[02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:21.630]  After it's kinda develops,
[02:01:21.630 --> 02:01:23.310]  it's more of a sativa dominant plant
[02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:24.510]  or an equatorial type plant.
[02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:26.510]  So it's gonna give you substantial stretch.
[02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:28.110]  It's gonna give you a longer flower time.
[02:01:28.110 --> 02:01:29.750]  You're looking at eight weeks,
[02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:31.550]  you can start pulling it down.
[02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:33.230]  You can start pulling it down earlier if you want,
[02:01:33.230 --> 02:01:36.990]  but eight weeks to 11 weeks is where I like to take it.
[02:01:36.990 --> 02:01:39.390]  At 11 weeks, you get the skunkier tones,
[02:01:39.390 --> 02:01:43.150]  the wines, the complexity really starts to roll in.
[02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:49.190]  It's got awesome euphoric effects.
[02:01:49.190 --> 02:01:52.550]  It's got a STEMI couch lock for some people.
[02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:53.910]  Some people you can run around,
[02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:57.670]  but really it's a good all around strain.
[02:01:57.670 --> 02:01:59.470]  Tests kinda all over the board,
[02:01:59.470 --> 02:02:03.950]  somewhere between 18 and 24% on average.
[02:02:04.830 --> 02:02:08.430]  It's got some CBG in there, it's substantial,
[02:02:08.430 --> 02:02:11.430]  some up to 2%, 2.5%.
[02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:13.030]  It's a unique strain.
[02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:15.070]  It's a unique strain, you don't see a lot of that profile.
[02:02:15.070 --> 02:02:20.070]  It's got that old school, hashy skunk, kinda spicy tones.
[02:02:21.070 --> 02:02:23.950]  As I've gone further in the line, F3,
[02:02:23.950 --> 02:02:28.950]  and so I've figured out that there's a lot more
[02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:29.910]  purple STEM phenols,
[02:02:29.910 --> 02:02:32.990]  which is giving me more placement on the globe.
[02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:35.830]  You've got more Indian land race and Pakistani
[02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:38.830]  and stuff like that with those purple STEM traits
[02:02:38.830 --> 02:02:40.630]  going into early flower and stuff like that.
[02:02:40.630 --> 02:02:43.550]  So I've been working a long time on it.
[02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:45.470]  I've been playing with it forever.
[02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:47.390]  It's something that I'm never not growing.
[02:02:48.310 --> 02:02:53.310]  And out of the F2 stock, I pulled the PAM 15
[02:02:53.310 --> 02:02:58.110]  and that rivals some of my favorite smoke of all time.
[02:02:58.110 --> 02:02:59.430]  And yeah, there you go.
[02:02:59.430 --> 02:03:01.190]  There you go right there.
[02:03:01.190 --> 02:03:03.830]  Look at the gorgeousness of this PAM
[02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:07.110]  at less than three weeks old.
[02:03:07.110 --> 02:03:10.790]  The stock on her is solid.
[02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:15.790]  I mean, she is, I've posted her on Facebook, Instagram.
[02:03:16.110 --> 02:03:17.510]  I never post veg plants.
[02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:19.830]  Like look at this fucking seedling.
[02:03:20.830 --> 02:03:22.670]  She is a stock girl.
[02:03:22.670 --> 02:03:27.110]  We're at one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine.
[02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:30.910]  We're at nine nodes in three weeks
[02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:34.630]  and I'm at a quarter inch stock here on a seedling.
[02:03:34.630 --> 02:03:36.550]  I'm pretty impressed with this, bro.
[02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:38.710]  Which you know how much I'm impressed with the PAM
[02:03:38.710 --> 02:03:43.710]  and I've cracked 500 seed packs in the last year.
[02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:47.310]  So I'm stupid impressed with the PAM.
[02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:49.830]  I just wanted to say that for you.
[02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:51.590]  No, that's beautiful.
[02:03:54.110 --> 02:03:57.030]  It's the vigorous truth.
[02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:58.750]  I was just showing my wife a picture the other day.
[02:03:58.750 --> 02:04:00.270]  I was showing my wife a picture of the room
[02:04:00.270 --> 02:04:02.350]  and I'm like, look at all those plants.
[02:04:02.350 --> 02:04:04.870]  And all those plants look the same
[02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:06.950]  except for those ones right over there.
[02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:08.910]  And she's like, well, what are those ones?
[02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:10.190]  I'm all, those are PAMs.
[02:04:10.190 --> 02:04:11.230]  That's PAM one.
[02:04:11.230 --> 02:04:15.070]  It doesn't look like anything else inside the room
[02:04:15.070 --> 02:04:16.070]  at any place.
[02:04:16.070 --> 02:04:19.230]  It's got a certain stance about it.
[02:04:19.230 --> 02:04:20.590]  It's got a certain structure about it.
[02:04:20.590 --> 02:04:22.270]  It's got a certain smell about it.
[02:04:22.270 --> 02:04:23.950]  It's got something special,
[02:04:23.950 --> 02:04:26.430]  which is what made me keep it in the first place,
[02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:27.590]  you know, years ago.
[02:04:27.590 --> 02:04:32.590]  So the male that I used to do the BX
[02:04:32.910 --> 02:04:35.670]  and to do the F2 and all that was,
[02:04:35.670 --> 02:04:38.870]  came out of the original seed stock that I had made
[02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:40.470]  that I selected the PAM out of.
[02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:44.070]  It was one of the only males in the group.
[02:04:44.070 --> 02:04:47.550]  It wasn't one of the males that I would have selected
[02:04:47.550 --> 02:04:51.150]  if I was doing a male selection, you know, with numbers,
[02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:53.390]  but it turns out that that male,
[02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:57.550]  everything that I touched it to, turned out extra chronic.
[02:04:57.550 --> 02:04:59.910]  I mean, it seemed to add awesome,
[02:04:59.910 --> 02:05:02.150]  extreme vigor as you're seeing.
[02:05:02.150 --> 02:05:04.750]  It seems to add extra crazy stank
[02:05:04.750 --> 02:05:07.830]  on a lot of the veg plants
[02:05:07.870 --> 02:05:09.550]  that are just out of control,
[02:05:09.550 --> 02:05:11.390]  stinky out through the roof.
[02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:14.910]  And it adds a ton, a ton of grease.
[02:05:14.910 --> 02:05:16.310]  PAM isn't the greasiest plant.
[02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:20.230]  She's more of a dry resin phenotype.
[02:05:20.230 --> 02:05:22.310]  You know, the resin's more of a cookie type resin
[02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:25.950]  that you can crack it open and it'll fall on the table.
[02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:30.950]  But the generations beyond become grease.
[02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:33.190]  Much more grease becomes apparent,
[02:05:33.190 --> 02:05:35.510]  especially in the 15s and a lot more of the things
[02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:37.790]  that old Gramps grows.
[02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:39.830]  I always give him tons to play with and things,
[02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:42.190]  and he's always getting the greasiest little things
[02:05:42.190 --> 02:05:44.270]  to come out of there.
[02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:48.150]  So a lot more grease was imparted on that male
[02:05:48.150 --> 02:05:51.910]  and other strains that I had crossed to that male as well
[02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:53.670]  have turned out to be superstars.
[02:05:53.670 --> 02:05:57.630]  So now, you know, in hindsight,
[02:05:57.630 --> 02:06:00.030]  you know, maybe I'm selecting things,
[02:06:00.030 --> 02:06:01.910]  you know, maybe I got to open my mind
[02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:04.110]  in my selection process a little different,
[02:06:04.110 --> 02:06:06.030]  but it turned out very well.
[02:06:06.030 --> 02:06:09.270]  So that was the male that hit PAM one again
[02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:12.350]  to do that back cross.
[02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:16.670]  And those seeds are coming out extremely.
[02:06:16.670 --> 02:06:18.790]  PAM's already a strong breeder as it is.
[02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:21.030]  So if you cross her to anything,
[02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:22.630]  you're going to get a lot of strong PAM traits.
[02:06:22.630 --> 02:06:26.110]  She's not too far removed from land-raised.
[02:06:26.110 --> 02:06:30.070]  She's really, like I said, stretchy, hazed, sativa dominant,
[02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:32.950]  really raw, really nasty.
[02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:36.150]  Gamey, if you will.
[02:06:36.150 --> 02:06:39.350]  So anything she touches, it's strong.
[02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:44.350]  So back cross even further made that strength prominent
[02:06:44.670 --> 02:06:47.910]  and you're getting, but perfect PAM structure
[02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:51.070]  and things that are extremely similar to PAM
[02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:54.830]  from grapes and sweets to really nasty
[02:06:54.830 --> 02:06:59.190]  and rancid, rotten stuff is coming out in those BXs.
[02:06:59.190 --> 02:07:04.190]  But they all are looking like morphologically
[02:07:04.590 --> 02:07:06.310]  just like PAM.
[02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:09.030]  So that's basically what that BX is.
[02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:11.070]  And that's something that I was going to,
[02:07:11.070 --> 02:07:12.030]  I've been diving through.
[02:07:12.030 --> 02:07:14.110]  I've had a couple of people close to me,
[02:07:14.110 --> 02:07:16.070]  family members that have kind of looked into them
[02:07:16.070 --> 02:07:17.550]  and they're in their garden this season
[02:07:17.550 --> 02:07:19.910]  and I'm looking at a lot of them.
[02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:22.870]  And it's something that wasn't going to release.
[02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:24.790]  I was going to back cross a couple more times
[02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:28.990]  and really make it PAM when you pop that seed or try to.
[02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:32.510]  So I figured those beans would be pretty valuable.
[02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:35.270]  They're good, great stuff's going to come out of there.
[02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:37.670]  And if you're into breeding or playing with something
[02:07:37.670 --> 02:07:40.790]  that's unusual, like you've seen,
[02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:44.750]  it'll put a sparkle or a jump in your step.
[02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:46.950]  That's for sure, the whole way through.
[02:07:48.710 --> 02:07:49.550]  Now-
[02:07:51.710 --> 02:07:54.030]  Just quickly, Cascadian,
[02:07:54.710 --> 02:07:59.710]  did we have a winner for Rebel Grown or was that the last?
[02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:05.550]  We got Jonathan Davis with 230
[02:08:05.550 --> 02:08:07.510]  for the Rebel Grown 5G Purple.
[02:08:08.630 --> 02:08:12.110]  Okay, and he was looking for where to pay, right?
[02:08:12.110 --> 02:08:14.630]  So that's where you go.
[02:08:14.630 --> 02:08:15.470]  And there was a,
[02:08:15.470 --> 02:08:18.590]  did I see there was a last minute bid on that too?
[02:08:19.670 --> 02:08:20.510]  Yeah, he was-
[02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:21.350]  Or if he was-
[02:08:22.350 --> 02:08:26.150]  If he was, if that person wants to match it at 230,
[02:08:26.150 --> 02:08:28.790]  we can do that too and do a double one,
[02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:29.630]  if he's interested.
[02:08:29.630 --> 02:08:32.270]  That was Alpha Jalo.
[02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:35.830]  So Alpha Jalo, if you, both of you guys,
[02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:40.150]  Jonathan Davis, if you guys want to just DM me
[02:08:40.150 --> 02:08:42.070]  on Instagram, Dutch Blooms,
[02:08:42.070 --> 02:08:46.590]  a screenshot of your PayPal donation to that right there,
[02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:50.350]  PayPal.me slash Delano Silver,
[02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:53.590]  then I will ship those out to you.
[02:08:53.590 --> 02:08:54.790]  It's super cool.
[02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:55.630]  Thanks, you guys.
[02:08:55.630 --> 02:08:58.630]  Rebel's underrated as a breeder.
[02:08:58.630 --> 02:09:00.310]  Like, I mean- I think so.
[02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:02.350]  If you go to his fucking farm
[02:09:02.350 --> 02:09:04.510]  and look at the work that he's producing
[02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:07.150]  for sale to the public from his own stock,
[02:09:08.190 --> 02:09:09.270]  some of his cookie,
[02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:11.190]  some of his cookie work is incredible, man.
[02:09:11.190 --> 02:09:14.630]  He brought Blue Dream into a lot of varieties
[02:09:14.630 --> 02:09:15.910]  to thicken some stuff.
[02:09:16.510 --> 02:09:18.630]  He started really changing the shape
[02:09:18.630 --> 02:09:20.590]  on some conventional strains
[02:09:20.590 --> 02:09:22.590]  and then increasing their qualities.
[02:09:22.590 --> 02:09:25.030]  He was the first guy I know that really had a truth,
[02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:26.830]  like 31, because we have it,
[02:09:26.830 --> 02:09:29.470]  like a 31.8 OG chem dog.
[02:09:29.470 --> 02:09:31.630]  So he was hitting hot numbers before.
[02:09:31.630 --> 02:09:34.510]  This was 10, 12 years ago.
[02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:37.390]  Well, let me say, 10.
[02:09:37.390 --> 02:09:39.790]  So 10 years ago, he was popping stock out
[02:09:39.790 --> 02:09:42.350]  that was blowing in that low 30 range.
[02:09:42.350 --> 02:09:43.870]  Nobody was really doing it.
[02:09:43.870 --> 02:09:46.870]  So, you know, the work that he has,
[02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:48.950]  the parental lines that have went into it,
[02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:50.270]  the selection process,
[02:09:50.270 --> 02:09:53.550]  it's just killer stock to hold onto and utilize.
[02:09:53.550 --> 02:09:56.270]  I still have the OG CD stashed,
[02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:58.710]  the one that throws that 31.8.
[02:09:58.710 --> 02:09:59.550]  Fire.
[02:09:59.550 --> 02:10:01.070]  I mean, unbelievable.
[02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:03.990]  You got the winners written down over there?
[02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:05.230]  Yeah, I'm writing them down.
[02:10:05.230 --> 02:10:06.430]  All right, man, cool.
[02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:07.270]  We're good, man.
[02:10:08.630 --> 02:10:09.470]  Oh yeah, dude.
[02:10:10.470 --> 02:10:13.830]  The Stardust, that's the other one that I have
[02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:14.870]  that you guys should check out
[02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:16.310]  that he was all jazzed about.
[02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:17.510]  He was like, dude.
[02:10:18.430 --> 02:10:20.430]  You know, and when he kind of like says,
[02:10:20.430 --> 02:10:21.470]  dude about his own shit,
[02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:23.070]  you know, and he's handing me a pile of shit.
[02:10:23.070 --> 02:10:24.710]  I'm just like, okay.
[02:10:24.710 --> 02:10:27.150]  What was the Stardust made from?
[02:10:27.150 --> 02:10:28.070]  I have to go pull the pack.
[02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:29.310]  I can't remember.
[02:10:29.310 --> 02:10:31.630]  I didn't have a chance to pop them this year.
[02:10:31.630 --> 02:10:32.550]  Yeah, I'll hit you later.
[02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:33.390]  I'm just curious.
[02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:34.710]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:10:34.710 --> 02:10:37.030]  He's got a wider range of stock.
[02:10:37.030 --> 02:10:39.430]  He doesn't like just 1% of the lead today.
[02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:41.950]  He likes the double sour OGs.
[02:10:41.950 --> 02:10:44.350]  He's got some conventional stuff that's stables,
[02:10:44.350 --> 02:10:45.190]  but I'm telling you, man,
[02:10:45.190 --> 02:10:46.470]  he brought a blue dream in
[02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:48.070]  and played with it in some lines
[02:10:48.070 --> 02:10:48.910]  and he improved it.
[02:10:48.910 --> 02:10:50.190]  His cookies are phenomenal.
[02:10:50.190 --> 02:10:54.550]  He did a cookie improvement on frost,
[02:10:54.550 --> 02:10:58.270]  flower shape, the way the plant sits,
[02:10:58.270 --> 02:11:00.030]  just richer smoke.
[02:11:00.030 --> 02:11:02.110]  If you, next time you come to Humboldt in a season,
[02:11:02.110 --> 02:11:03.390]  you got to hit him up and see his farm.
[02:11:03.390 --> 02:11:04.830]  He does gorgeous work out there.
[02:11:04.830 --> 02:11:07.270]  No, he's, I mean like him and Jack,
[02:11:07.270 --> 02:11:10.150]  all those guys you had on that breeder series,
[02:11:10.150 --> 02:11:12.350]  I've connected with a lot of them on a personal level,
[02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:14.950]  but for sure him and Jackson,
[02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:16.310]  they're really cool dudes,
[02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:17.510]  and Eric for sure.
[02:11:19.550 --> 02:11:20.830]  Anyways, speaking of Jackson,
[02:11:20.830 --> 02:11:23.790]  next up is we're going to do this Jackson,
[02:11:23.790 --> 02:11:25.230]  then we're going to do yours, Kev.
[02:11:25.230 --> 02:11:28.710]  So we're coming to the last ones here.
[02:11:28.710 --> 02:11:31.270]  Ghost OG cross Sky Jaro.
[02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:32.110]  Ooh.
[02:11:32.110 --> 02:11:33.710]  We'll do two packs as well.
[02:11:33.710 --> 02:11:36.630]  And I know this line fairly well.
[02:11:37.150 --> 02:11:39.110]  It's in the progress that I'm at,
[02:11:39.110 --> 02:11:41.070]  which is just into flower.
[02:11:41.070 --> 02:11:43.150]  I've talked with Jackson a bunch about it.
[02:11:43.150 --> 02:11:47.230]  The Sky Jaro, to me, is in his description,
[02:11:47.230 --> 02:11:51.510]  and what I was looking at of it is the OG's OG.
[02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:55.150]  It has the structure, it holds the fuel,
[02:11:56.150 --> 02:11:58.830]  and then he dumped the Ghost OG on it.
[02:11:58.830 --> 02:12:00.030]  And it just was kind of like,
[02:12:00.030 --> 02:12:04.670]  let's mash it up and find the foul.
[02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:09.390]  And as I'm looking at, I did probably 400 of them.
[02:12:09.390 --> 02:12:11.230]  So I'm looking at a large number.
[02:12:11.230 --> 02:12:13.550]  I haven't got the through flower at them,
[02:12:13.550 --> 02:12:17.390]  but morphologically, they're all the five fingers.
[02:12:17.390 --> 02:12:20.590]  You know, they're all five-fingered jacks,
[02:12:20.590 --> 02:12:22.070]  OG's, OG's, you know,
[02:12:22.070 --> 02:12:23.790]  and there's some pickles in there.
[02:12:23.790 --> 02:12:25.750]  There's some fuel on the stem rub.
[02:12:27.390 --> 02:12:28.230]  What is this?
[02:12:28.230 --> 02:12:31.230]  Not Peter, it's a pre-born selection.
[02:12:31.230 --> 02:12:33.670]  It's a pre-born selection,
[02:12:33.670 --> 02:12:36.150]  Sky Jaro cross Ghost OG,
[02:12:36.150 --> 02:12:38.790]  and Ghost OG is the female in that.
[02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:40.270]  It's a cut, it's a cut.
[02:12:40.270 --> 02:12:42.510]  And I don't know too much about the Ghost.
[02:12:42.510 --> 02:12:43.950]  It's a well-known cut, I know that,
[02:12:43.950 --> 02:12:46.310]  but I don't know if you could speak to it, Kev.
[02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:48.510]  Oh yeah, the Ghost cut, the Ghost cut,
[02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:52.270]  it was, I'm muted up,
[02:12:52.270 --> 02:12:54.590]  it was coming out of Oregon,
[02:12:54.590 --> 02:12:56.710]  but it's really, it's like the true OG.
[02:12:56.710 --> 02:12:59.310]  It's like the old, it's the Josh D cut.
[02:12:59.310 --> 02:13:01.750]  If you genotype it, it's the Josh D cut.
[02:13:01.750 --> 02:13:04.830]  So it's a throwback to like the original OG
[02:13:05.710 --> 02:13:10.710]  and has a rich earth base, does beautifully outside.
[02:13:11.150 --> 02:13:13.910]  I mean, you can't go wrong with Ghost.
[02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:14.750]  You know, I love it.
[02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:15.630]  I like the Ghost cut a lot.
[02:13:15.630 --> 02:13:18.350]  I prefer growing it outdoor than like the SFE.
[02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:22.390]  And then the SFE is more of a citrus.
[02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:26.830]  And the Puyallup, the Hollywood Topanga,
[02:13:26.830 --> 02:13:30.470]  those are more like a marshmallow-y kind of tone.
[02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:32.670]  If you got your hands on the Ghost,
[02:13:32.670 --> 02:13:34.910]  what you got is you got this rich earth base
[02:13:34.910 --> 02:13:36.470]  with bangin' gas.
[02:13:37.870 --> 02:13:41.470]  So we'll start those at a hundred bucks for two packs.
[02:13:41.470 --> 02:13:43.910]  We should be 20, 24 seeds in there.
[02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:44.790]  Probably a little bit more.
[02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:46.670]  Gene always steps them in there.
[02:13:46.670 --> 02:13:47.510]  Yeah, he does.
[02:13:49.070 --> 02:13:51.190]  Coming from a guy who opened up a bunch of those packs
[02:13:51.190 --> 02:13:52.630]  to grow himself.
[02:13:54.150 --> 02:13:55.870]  And I've been like fucking just,
[02:13:55.870 --> 02:13:58.950]  you know, like I can't say enough about Gene's work.
[02:13:58.950 --> 02:14:01.590]  And maybe it's just that our profiles
[02:14:01.590 --> 02:14:05.670]  and what we like in life are similar or, you know, whatever.
[02:14:05.670 --> 02:14:07.470]  But like, I've run through a lot of stuff
[02:14:07.470 --> 02:14:09.870]  and that's predominantly what I'm using in my work.
[02:14:09.870 --> 02:14:12.150]  And it's just such a pleasure to know the dude
[02:14:12.150 --> 02:14:15.030]  and to have experienced the work that he's made.
[02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:17.830]  You know, it's like, it's knowing a good musician
[02:14:17.830 --> 02:14:20.230]  and then getting to work, play jam with him.
[02:14:20.230 --> 02:14:21.710]  That's how, kind of how I feel like it.
[02:14:21.710 --> 02:14:22.710]  It's really fucking cool.
[02:14:22.710 --> 02:14:24.630]  You know, it's fun shit.
[02:14:24.630 --> 02:14:40.400]  So what else we got to talk about?
[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:41.960]  Did we start a timer?
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:50.700]  I'm reading all these comments to the left.
[02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:52.980]  I've got two other phones set up.
[02:14:52.980 --> 02:14:53.900]  I'm still old school.
[02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:55.140]  I got burner phones.
[02:14:56.060 --> 02:14:58.460]  So it's hard to keep up with the comments.
[02:14:58.460 --> 02:15:00.900]  Much props to Cascadian who's handling that
[02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:02.820]  because it's hard to do that
[02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:05.820]  and keep up with the conversation at the old time.
[02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:07.100]  So. Yeah, thank you.
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:17.200]  So are we at 300 with Gene in it?
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:20.400]  Isn't the sky, isn't the gyro is a line
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:21.640]  that's just, it's a line.
[02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:24.560]  And then I think the gyro is the Skywalker,
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:26.760]  the Skywalker OG, which was,
[02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:29.240]  have you ever messed with a Skywalker cut?
[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:30.360]  I for sure did, man.
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:32.960]  I lined that one up when they were releasing
[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:36.680]  the Star Wars movie back in like 2014.
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:38.720]  I was like, I'm going to nail this one.
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:41.760]  I had the Vader OG or something like that.
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:44.240]  And I was going to, and no one gave a fuck, dude.
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:47.960]  For him, but the Skywalker,
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:50.200]  I mean, it didn't care how I marketed it.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:51.840]  And it was silver.
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:52.680]  Big.
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:54.360]  It had big full cylinders, but you know,
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:57.080]  it was a larger frame and you had to take it
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:15:58.360]  a little deeper in the cycle,
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:00.640]  but the product was fucking supernatural
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:02.800]  and it moved for a premium.
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:04.600]  And so I had that cut.
[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:06.120]  We used to run the living shit out of it.
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:07.680]  Cloned well too.
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:09.200]  That was just really, to me,
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:14.200]  the sky was like the most expansive of the OGs frame-wise.
[02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:17.400]  That's the one I've been looking for, that sky.
[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:18.360]  They wanted to open up.
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:19.360]  Yeah, the Skywalker cut.
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:21.800]  I smoked a killer one.
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:26.440]  There's a dude in Vegas that has a no-till,
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:28.360]  smaller operator, and man,
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:31.480]  he and I hooked up at a conference
[02:16:31.480 --> 02:16:36.480]  and he broke out some indoor no-till, 12 cycle shit.
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:39.840]  And it was some of the best OG I ever smoked.
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:42.360]  I mean, that cut is still incredible and done right.
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:43.720]  It is fucking stunning.
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:45.240]  It just surprises people
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:47.440]  because it'll grow into your lights.
[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:49.840]  So you have to be a little like-
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:51.040]  Having grown it, I was just gonna say,
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:52.640]  having grown it, that's the one that's putting
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:54.640]  on the structure on this plant for sure.
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:57.360]  Yeah, I don't know the Jaro,
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:59.600]  but I know the structure of the Skywalker.
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:03.480]  And the Ghost is conventional, medium frame OG,
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:06.720]  but just incredible quality flower.
[02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:09.800]  And the Jaro is, I'm gonna mess it up,
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:11.720]  but it's connected to root beer.
[02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:13.640]  I think the root beer was pulled from it
[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:15.960]  or the Jaro is an offspring of root beer,
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:17.400]  one way or the other.
[02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:23.200]  It's definitely connected to his coveted root beer.
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:25.080]  And so that's why I was like,
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:26.760]  well, I'm just gonna run the living shit out of it.
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:28.880]  I'll run 800 seeds and I'm gonna find
[02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:30.960]  that fucking root beer, fucking OG stack.
[02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:33.440]  We'll see.
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:37.680]  Cause I'm looking at the label in my mind of the root beer
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:39.880]  cause he had given me a jar years ago
[02:17:39.880 --> 02:17:42.040]  and like a little, like a,
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:43.080]  I still have the note too.
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:46.840]  It was some diabolical shit that Leo gave it to me, right?
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:48.920]  When they still had the business,
[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:50.120]  but it was Leo wrote it out
[02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:53.920]  and it was some diabolical shit from Gene's fucking mind.
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:17:57.800]  It was that the root beer and it was the lineage of it
[02:17:57.800 --> 02:17:59.600]  where it was the PK, there was,
[02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:03.960]  it was just, I'll have to, I got it written down.
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:05.600]  I'll dig it up and send you a photo.
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:06.800]  Yeah, that'd be cool.
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:08.920]  And his PK is a different one too.
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:13.920]  So he has the LA PK, you have the Hollywood, right?
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:18.960]  Well, both I got the LA PK as the, the broad leaf, right?
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:21.160]  That's what we auctioned off tonight.
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:24.400]  And then I used to have the same cut he did
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:27.760]  and I called it the Topanga,
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:30.440]  but I got that from, I got that from Mandel.
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:32.600]  And so it was the same cut that Gene has
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:34.520]  where it was the ultra exotic hundred,
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:37.000]  you know, 110 and eight to something in that,
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:40.080]  in that time period with a marshmallow tinge to it,
[02:18:40.080 --> 02:18:41.400]  just incredible.
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:45.400]  The one we picked up from my partner in Seattle,
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:49.120]  they call that the Hollywood OG.
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:51.720]  And it's a different, it's a different variation
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:53.920]  of that marshmallow OG.
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:18:57.040]  So I think that the marshmallow has got a better flavor,
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:59.520]  but that one that I picked up from Homie
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:02.360]  has got some of the best aggressive growing
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:05.080]  and it's more of a heavier gas.
[02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:07.960]  So like the speed, the speed that it grows
[02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:10.400]  and the quality of its replication,
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:13.680]  like if you want an OG that you can grow and clone
[02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:15.040]  and then the product's incredible
[02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:18.160]  when it turns into weed, that one.
[02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:20.360]  I got, I knew that Hollywood OG right away
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:22.600]  when you said it because there's a 502 producer
[02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:23.840]  that puts it out.
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:25.560]  And when I, when I hit it,
[02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:27.280]  they're called Seattle's Private Reserve.
[02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:29.640]  I was like, oh, that's so much like Gorilla Glue,
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:30.560]  like so much.
[02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:34.080]  And it's that marshmallow-y, really similar.
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:36.720]  It's the chem coming through, obviously.
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:38.120]  And, and, and the numbers,
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:39.920]  the numbers were a little lower on it too,
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:41.280]  which was funny because it used to,
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:42.760]  like, you know, we'd pull it in
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:46.080]  and come in like 17-8, 18-1.
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:50.960]  Some of the original OGs, those first lines that came out,
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:52.640]  the numbers weren't high.
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:54.440]  That was one of the ways I could kind of tell
[02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:57.160]  if it was one of the old OGs was like,
[02:19:57.160 --> 02:20:00.000]  had it been touched and adjusted in potency?
[02:20:01.800 --> 02:20:03.320]  And so the numbers let,
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:06.080]  and we have to go back a decade and a half to do this,
[02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:09.960]  but that, that time period lets you kind of see
[02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:13.600]  what was stuff that had been S1'd out of it and selected,
[02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:15.600]  or what was the stuff that was original
[02:20:15.600 --> 02:20:17.120]  before we had genotyping?
[02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:18.800]  Yeah.
[02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:20.640]  And we would use keepotyping to help us understand,
[02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:21.880]  like, what was what.
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:25.880]  The winner on this one,
[02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:28.640]  the two packs of the Ghost OG Crust Sky Gyro
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:31.160]  goes to Soviet Smoker 420.
[02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:33.800]  And that's your second auction winner of the night, dude.
[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:34.920]  Thank you very much, man.
[02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:36.680]  That's 800 and,
[02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:39.960]  800 and what,
[02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:43.200]  40 bucks that I'm adding up here, dude.
[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:44.480]  Thank you so much, dude.
[02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:45.480]  That's fucking cool.
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:50.160]  And you're gonna be stoked, man.
[02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:52.720]  I think you're gonna really enjoy the gear.
[02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:57.200]  I think that the price that he has given me those seeds for
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:00.680]  to sell on the seed site is fucking ridiculously low.
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.920]  On all the other sites, his gear,
[02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:06.240]  their stuff goes for a lot more.
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:09.480]  And so he's a cool fucking dude, man.
[02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:10.600]  Big props to Gene.
[02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:13.920]  Speaking of Gene, you're up, Kev.
[02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:17.440]  This is the highlight of the night,
[02:21:17.440 --> 02:21:19.360]  our year two auctions.
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:22.960]  And we'll do the, go do the Red Hindu first.
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:26.640]  Yeah, at which he has put a lot in that Red Hindu,
[02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:31.640]  because I ran a bunch of, at least 300 of the Sky Cuddler.
[02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:34.120]  And the Sky Cuddler has the Skywalker in it.
[02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:38.000]  And whatever he got to make the Cuddler OG or Cuddler Kush
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:39.320]  has that Red Hindu in it.
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:41.520]  I know it and I can see it morphologically
[02:21:41.520 --> 02:21:42.880]  in that Sky Cuddler.
[02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:45.480]  And it was just a large frame.
[02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:48.120]  Yeah, yeah, close.
[02:21:48.120 --> 02:21:50.920]  And close is what we're gonna remember.
[02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:51.760]  Okay.
[02:21:54.400 --> 02:21:55.240]  But it was just,
[02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:56.720]  there was a time period, right?
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:22:01.720]  Where I was the dealer for Fishinado and Gene.
[02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:05.720]  And so I used to get cases of the stock
[02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:09.920]  and the Red Hindu was one that he pointed out saying,
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:13.040]  hey, this is stuff that was from our area
[02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:17.920]  that historically had been dank, big frame, fiery herb.
[02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:20.000]  And yeah, 10 pack.
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.880]  And I picked them up.
[02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:25.240]  And then I knew that some friends had run them
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:27.440]  and just dug them and I held them.
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:30.200]  And I was intending to break into them at some point.
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:33.040]  And then this auction came up
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:35.680]  and I realized that those were the things that I had
[02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:36.800]  that were most well-known
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:40.520]  that would drive most direction to Delano.
[02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:44.560]  And the funny thing is,
[02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:46.400]  is I actually paid for all the seeds.
[02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:48.600]  Like the ones that people give me, I actually open quicker.
[02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:52.040]  But if I buy the fucking pack, I put it away.
[02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:53.720]  And so it's,
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:58.320]  so I would say, I think I paid like,
[02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:04.280]  I bet they went for like 300 retail when they sold.
[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:06.240]  And so that would be the base cost,
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:08.880]  but they can run because you can't get them anywhere.
[02:23:09.720 --> 02:23:12.520]  I think we still gotta start them higher than that.
[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:14.720]  You set the bidding, but I'm just saying like in real life.
[02:23:14.720 --> 02:23:17.200]  I'm just saying like, dude, if it's 300 bucks, dude,
[02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:18.040]  I'm like, you know.
[02:23:18.040 --> 02:23:19.600]  But you can't buy it.
[02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:20.440]  I know, I know.
[02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:21.880]  You can't find it.
[02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:23.720]  Well, the thing is they don't sell them anymore.
[02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:24.760]  And so the thing is that,
[02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:27.920]  when I picked those up, that was a couple of years back,
[02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:28.760]  but they've been held good.
[02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:30.640]  Look at Nick, he's twitching, dude.
[02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:31.560]  He's twitching over there.
[02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:33.520]  He's like, he told his wife,
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:35.120]  I'll take my fucking wallet.
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:39.040]  I'm authorized to spend up to $500
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:41.400]  on this one particular fucking option.
[02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:43.960]  I'm like, somebody's gonna go past 500.
[02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:44.800]  And I want that for the new-
[02:23:44.800 --> 02:23:46.360]  Let's start right there, bro.
[02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:49.120]  Let's start with your donation right there.
[02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:50.200]  You know what I mean?
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:52.240]  Shares like no more.
[02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:53.080]  500.
[02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:56.000]  Nick Risen is the starting bid on the,
[02:23:58.280 --> 02:24:01.040]  is that what you wanna throw down on the Red Hindu Kush?
[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:02.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:03.560]  All right.
[02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:04.840]  That's where I would put my money too.
[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:06.640]  The Black Lime Reserve definitely has the name
[02:24:06.640 --> 02:24:08.720]  and you're gonna find some amazing gear.
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:09.560]  I'll get the Black Lime Reserve cup.
[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:11.360]  Red Hindu Kush takes you back.
[02:24:11.360 --> 02:24:13.080]  I want that.
[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:14.080]  I seen the Black Lime.
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:17.840]  I gave a pack of Black Lime like a year or two ago
[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:21.600]  to a charity auction for, who was it?
[02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:23.680]  It might've been involved in something
[02:24:23.680 --> 02:24:27.360]  to do with Mandel or Mandel's death.
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:30.240]  And I wanted to throw some money at it.
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:33.520]  And I'm telling you, I think they went for like 2,800,
[02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:34.360]  three grand.
[02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:36.560]  Yeah.
[02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:38.000]  So the Black Limes is the same thing.
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.600]  You can't access that material.
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:44.000]  You can't get your hands on that progenitor stock.
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:44.840]  You're not gonna get your hands on-
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:46.800]  And no one has a cut.
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:48.600]  No one has the female cut.
[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:50.480]  Like Jackson told me just the other day,
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:52.720]  he hasn't given it to a single soul.
[02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:54.160]  No, no, no, no.
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:55.440]  No one's got the female.
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:57.600]  And then Ellie passed away.
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:00.560]  And so Leo, I think still holds the male.
[02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:06.440]  And then Tara, Ellie's friend in Rocket Girl,
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:09.200]  I think, what was the name of her seed company?
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:11.280]  Rocket Girl Enterprises maybe?
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:14.160]  But Ellie Elston, she passed away recently.
[02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:18.560]  And she held that OG,
[02:25:19.880 --> 02:25:24.600]  the lime in hand in consistent form.
[02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:26.160]  So there's only a few people
[02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:28.800]  that even have the plants, period.
[02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:30.160]  And then Gene had the lime.
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:32.760]  And so the thing is you can't get that combo.
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:35.120]  And if I was, just like with the Red Hindus,
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:37.000]  if I was picking them up from somebody
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:38.040]  and I was gonna get them,
[02:25:38.040 --> 02:25:41.120]  I'd take that pack and I would just open pollinate it
[02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:44.320]  with whatever's in the pack, pollinate it.
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:46.760]  And then open that expression up big.
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:48.280]  And then now you'll be able to start
[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:50.240]  to see the distributions.
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:52.120]  And the same thing with the BLR
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:54.200]  is take them and shoot them in.
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:56.720]  And you're gonna see from that heavy chem gas
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:25:59.320]  to a lime that's just unbelievable.
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:02.720]  I mean, clear, clean, crisp, sharp,
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:04.840]  gas one way, lime the other.
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:07.760]  They did some beautiful work.
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:10.800]  And I wanted to do the Hindu up the hill
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:14.160]  because I wanted to see a big frame Hindu,
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:18.320]  the acrid, Nag Champa type flavor profile
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:20.680]  woven in with all these others that Gene uses.
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:22.000]  It would be interesting.
[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:24.440]  Like an enhanced bubble.
[02:26:24.440 --> 02:26:28.920]  I'm really excited to see the Afghani stock you gifted me.
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:30.280]  There's some Hindu in there.
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:32.760]  But it went through all the regions.
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:34.880]  There was a number of regions, the seed you gave me.
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:36.120]  And I'm looking at it right now.
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:38.600]  Waiting for it to pop into flower.
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:44.360]  No, it's trippy that that stuff was directly
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:47.560]  grown in Afghanistan by Iranians.
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:50.680]  So the Iranians crossed the border
[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:52.640]  and they work on that project.
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:55.800]  And that's where that seed stock came from.
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:26:59.720]  It's all stock from the area,
[02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:01.480]  but that was their selection
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:05.680]  from the crop they ran in Afghanistan.
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:08.960]  It came in the fennel seed bags and shit.
[02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:09.800]  Remember that?
[02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:12.360]  Yeah, it's on your post you put up.
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:13.560]  Fucking trippy, man.
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:15.760]  I tripped out when I met the cat
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:18.080]  that he wanted to give me some seed.
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:19.960]  And I didn't expect what he's about to give me,
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:21.880]  but it was a box of fucking fennel seed
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:25.080]  lined with the Afghani from each one of the selections.
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:28.000]  So they grabbed those from those areas
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:29.080]  and then utilized them.
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:33.280]  But it's Iranians cultivating cannabis in Afghanistan.
[02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:34.120]  That's cool.
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:36.040]  Have you popped any of them yourself?
[02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:39.040]  No, I just haven't.
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:42.920]  There was just no time, man.
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:44.760]  It was building the new store,
[02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:47.480]  building the fucking new nursery operations,
[02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:48.880]  building the farm.
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:52.000]  You just kind of, for a minute,
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:55.160]  you kind of don't have the ability to do side projects.
[02:27:55.160 --> 02:27:57.600]  I can run stock easier,
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:00.360]  but for me, seed sifting is stuff I like to be able to do
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:03.080]  where I can actually really look at them.
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.240]  Because it's something I enjoy.
[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:09.000]  So I want to be able to open a population up.
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.800]  I want to be able to take my time
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:13.720]  and go out and tag and look and make my comments
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:15.000]  and go through my journal
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:18.640]  and feel my way through this shit
[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:20.680]  because it makes me happy.
[02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:22.920]  But when you don't have any fucking time,
[02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:24.600]  you can't do that shit.
[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:27.560]  I'm running through big populations
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:29.600]  and all the other stuff I've been telling you guys about it.
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:30.680]  Yeah.
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:34.200]  I think I had like 25-ish per variety
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:36.280]  and they're the only things that I've taken cuts of,
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:37.240]  every single one.
[02:28:37.240 --> 02:28:38.480]  Because I just like,
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:39.440]  something in me was like,
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:40.360]  all right, this is base,
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:41.680]  you're going to need to learn this
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:44.200]  and it's going to be nice to have them in bed
[02:28:44.200 --> 02:28:45.840]  ready to fuck to do something with it
[02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:48.360]  and move kind of with them.
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:49.680]  So I really-
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:50.520]  It's profiles.
[02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:52.480]  I know, I dig it, man.
[02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:56.800]  I love those profiles from those regions.
[02:28:56.880 --> 02:29:01.880]  And right now we're in this huge trend of cakes and cookies,
[02:29:02.480 --> 02:29:03.320]  which is killer
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:06.000]  because it's what people like right now,
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.280]  but it's the pendulum of taste changes.
[02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:11.840]  That's when you need to have these choices
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:13.520]  and the earths, the dirts,
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:16.600]  the exotic spice with the earth and the dirt,
[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:18.800]  just stuff that you don't see in norm
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:21.240]  because people aren't working those directions.
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:23.240]  They don't have access to it.
[02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:25.880]  So just quickly-
[02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:28.560]  Oh man, this is up to 8.5.
[02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:29.760]  Oh, we just got another one.
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:31.040]  All right, so we're at 8.20.
[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:32.520]  Oh my God.
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:34.360]  Just got to go snap.
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:36.080]  Let me just say,
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:37.320]  let me just say,
[02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:40.240]  if this thing ends for under a thousand bucks,
[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:41.400]  someone's got to snipe in here
[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:43.040]  and this thing needs to go,
[02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:45.560]  like at least over a grand on this one.
[02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:48.080]  Yo, yo, can I go like 8.50?
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:49.560]  Dick, you're going to have to buy these ones
[02:29:49.560 --> 02:29:50.640]  and I'll go halfsies.
[02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:53.480]  Man, I'm getting a eye from the couch, bro,
[02:29:53.480 --> 02:29:55.040]  that's like fucked right now.
[02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:57.200]  You want to go a grand?
[02:29:57.200 --> 02:29:58.200]  You want to go half on it?
[02:29:58.200 --> 02:29:59.880]  I'll put five, you put five?
[02:29:59.880 --> 02:30:01.600]  I'll go five if you can go five.
[02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:04.560]  Nick, you do have a $500 budget.
[02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:06.600]  I got a $500 budget,
[02:30:06.600 --> 02:30:07.880]  which I was allowed to have.
[02:30:07.880 --> 02:30:08.720]  And that last-
[02:30:08.720 --> 02:30:09.560]  I'll do five, you do five.
[02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:11.280]  Let's do a thousand bucks on it.
[02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:12.120]  Can anyone beat a thousand bucks?
[02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:14.360]  I'll go five on it, man.
[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:15.200]  I'll go five.
[02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:16.680]  If somebody want to go halfies,
[02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:17.520]  quarteries, you do like-
[02:30:17.520 --> 02:30:20.720]  All right, somebody has 10 seconds to beat a thousand.
[02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:26.720]  10, nine, Cascadian, there you go.
[02:30:28.360 --> 02:30:29.200]  Eight, seven, six.
[02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:30.840]  G-Unit just hit a thousand.
[02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:33.600]  G-Unit just went with fuck G-Unit.
[02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:35.160]  Now I can't say fuck G-Unit,
[02:30:35.160 --> 02:30:37.920]  I love to say fuck G-Unit, you know?
[02:30:37.920 --> 02:30:38.760]  You can't.
[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:42.000]  Hey, G-Unit, I will trade you-
[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:46.240]  Oh shit, 10.25, Staten Island, 10.25.
[02:30:46.240 --> 02:30:48.280]  Oh, you hustling dogs now too, man.
[02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:51.240]  I'll trade you a dog for seats today.
[02:30:51.240 --> 02:30:53.360]  Oh no, I love dogs.
[02:30:53.360 --> 02:30:56.200]  I can't trade no dog, but I'll trade you a Pam.
[02:30:56.200 --> 02:30:57.200]  Like look at Tyler.
[02:30:57.200 --> 02:31:02.200]  He's like, you know, we all hustle right here.
[02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.520]  We'll do a joint breeding project with this.
[02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:08.160]  I came in here without my wallet,
[02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:10.480]  so I couldn't get in trouble when I went back inside.
[02:31:10.480 --> 02:31:12.800]  You know, so I'm dying here, man.
[02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:14.280]  I'm not gonna go there,
[02:31:14.280 --> 02:31:16.280]  because I know somebody who buys these.
[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:18.360]  10.25 from Staten Island Villa.
[02:31:21.950 --> 02:31:23.390]  Villa at 11.25.
[02:31:23.390 --> 02:31:25.190]  Y'all gotta love that country accent for me.
[02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:27.310]  Staten Island Visa.
[02:31:27.310 --> 02:31:28.310]  Villa.
[02:31:28.310 --> 02:31:30.110]  100 G-Unit came in at 11.00.
[02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:32.510]  There's 11.25.
[02:31:32.510 --> 02:31:34.190]  Motherfucker.
[02:31:34.190 --> 02:31:36.390]  I'm not sure if my comments are up.
[02:31:36.390 --> 02:31:38.390]  Bye as long as I'm allowed, bro.
[02:31:38.390 --> 02:31:39.510]  I know, me too, dude.
[02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:41.510]  I just needed, we needed to get a move in.
[02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:44.110]  I would have been happy to get that for a thousand bucks.
[02:31:44.110 --> 02:31:45.270]  That's a steal, dude.
[02:31:45.310 --> 02:31:48.430]  Anything under two is a steal on both these packs.
[02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:53.960]  All right, so I think we have Stat,
[02:31:55.040 --> 02:31:57.800]  yeah, we have Staten Island for the win.
[02:31:59.760 --> 02:32:00.600]  Are we calling it?
[02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:01.440]  Staten Island Villa.
[02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:03.640]  Yeah, we call it.
[02:32:03.640 --> 02:32:05.440]  11.25.
[02:32:05.440 --> 02:32:06.720]  11.25.
[02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:08.520]  Yeah, man, thanks, man.
[02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:10.320]  Thank you very much, dude.
[02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:11.800]  Thank you.
[02:32:11.800 --> 02:32:12.760]  Congratulations.
[02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:14.320]  Thank you, Cap, for putting them up, dude.
[02:32:14.320 --> 02:32:16.360]  They were, no, they've been in my hands for a while.
[02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:19.080]  You know how it is, it's hard to part with shit.
[02:32:19.080 --> 02:32:19.920]  Yeah.
[02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:23.600]  The thing was that, you know, we had Delano,
[02:32:23.600 --> 02:32:25.880]  but at the same time I had Delano on,
[02:32:25.880 --> 02:32:30.880]  I had some other friends that have a distribution,
[02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:36.040]  lit distro in the Bay, and then my buddy, Armani,
[02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:39.360]  and we were all talking about, you know,
[02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:41.360]  it was the equity, some of the equity issues,
[02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:43.920]  but the equity issue is really an issue of
[02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:48.120]  you're not on the upper level financially in life,
[02:32:48.120 --> 02:32:50.560]  and how do you come up?
[02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:52.600]  And so me and Armani known each other like,
[02:32:52.600 --> 02:32:54.680]  you know, fuck, 25 years,
[02:32:54.680 --> 02:32:57.680]  and that's just how we've always known it,
[02:32:57.680 --> 02:32:59.360]  where you gotta hustle your way through life,
[02:32:59.360 --> 02:33:02.760]  and you gotta support each other the best way you can.
[02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:05.600]  And I just want to take a second and just say thanks
[02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:08.160]  to all the people that contributed to the auction,
[02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:11.440]  and for kicking the money out, and for bringing the seeds,
[02:33:11.440 --> 02:33:14.480]  and for hosting the platform, and for taking the time,
[02:33:14.480 --> 02:33:16.960]  and kind of guiding me through this process,
[02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:20.800]  because it really was meant to be an assistance
[02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:22.960]  for someone that I've never met in person.
[02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:27.200]  And he's just been a really decent human being,
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:29.320]  and I would love to see him do well,
[02:33:29.320 --> 02:33:32.320]  and thank you so much for maybe helping,
[02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:33.440]  making that possible.
[02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:35.880]  Cool.
[02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:36.720]  It's cool you did.
[02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:38.440]  You're a fucking hero to us all, man.
[02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:42.720]  You support all of us in so many ways, man.
[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:43.560]  So.
[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:46.280]  And actually, just quickly again, as a reminder,
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:49.200]  all the people who aren't winning seeds,
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:51.240]  because we know these are expensive,
[02:33:51.240 --> 02:33:54.160]  and not many people, not everybody can afford them,
[02:33:54.160 --> 02:33:58.720]  but you could give a dollar, $2, $4, $10,
[02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:02.320]  you know, there's where to go.
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:04.360]  And to be honest, a lot of the folks
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:06.400]  that are buying this stuff, they know what it is,
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:07.600]  and they'll reproduce it,
[02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:10.880]  and they'll more than likely ship it to you,
[02:34:10.880 --> 02:34:12.120]  you know, in the end, if you hit them up,
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:14.080]  and people are pretty cool in this industry,
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:16.920]  is my experience.
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:18.760]  You got one more pack, right?
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:20.280]  We got one more pack, dude.
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:21.320]  Yeah.
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:22.720]  Go ahead, Kev.
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:27.720]  So the Black Lime pack, when that came out,
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:29.800]  I wanna say it took like a second or a third
[02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:32.360]  at the Emerald Cup when it popped out,
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:36.280]  and just beautiful.
[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:39.880]  You didn't see lime and gas combined like that,
[02:34:39.880 --> 02:34:41.400]  and it was just unique.
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:43.560]  Gene's lime cut is phenomenal,
[02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:47.480]  and that gas cut that Ellie and Leo were throwing down
[02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:50.320]  was just thick, because it had won the 2012 cup,
[02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:52.560]  the female won the 2012, and I have that female,
[02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:54.240]  and she's unbelievable.
[02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:57.920]  And so I see similar characteristics with the BLR
[02:34:57.920 --> 02:35:02.920]  with that female Chemdog Special,
[02:35:03.640 --> 02:35:06.560]  and the fact that it's got like really good resistance
[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:09.800]  outside to pathogens, good full body,
[02:35:09.800 --> 02:35:12.800]  holds itself up well, doesn't shed,
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:17.160]  indoor, paler, and brighter.
[02:35:17.160 --> 02:35:20.680]  And so like my buddy was running one of my cuts inside,
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:22.400]  and I was running the same cut outside,
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:23.560]  and both of them were gorgeous.
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:27.480]  The outside was greasier, little more thicker,
[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:28.880]  because the swing in night and day
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:31.000]  kind of brings that out more.
[02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:34.280]  The indoor was more refined, so it was sharper and crisper.
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:38.480]  So just incredible quality in flavors,
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:40.640]  and really good clean, clear, high,
[02:35:40.640 --> 02:35:42.720]  and really resistant to fungal problems,
[02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:46.520]  which is phenomenal for anything.
[02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:49.080]  And so at that time when these things were going,
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:53.800]  the BLR was retailing for like 500,
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:56.960]  and so 500 was what I paid for it when I picked it up.
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:01.080]  But you gotta start it out at probably like 15,
[02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:02.960]  because I know that when I moved it,
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:04.320]  I know that packs have moved,
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:07.440]  secondary packs that I've watched through
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:08.920]  have gone for like 45,
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:10.840]  and we're not trying to drive that kind of shit here.
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:12.400]  It's all well and good,
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:16.440]  but it's really about reasonable for the purchaser too.
[02:36:16.440 --> 02:36:18.920]  And so we'll throw it out at 15,
[02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:22.080]  and you get yourself something nice,
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:24.160]  and then whoever picks it up,
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:29.160]  I'll get you, you'll hit these guys up,
[02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:31.400]  and you'll give me your email,
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:35.720]  and I'll hit you up about something.
[02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:37.480]  So BLR is a good one.
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:38.600]  BLR is a good one,
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:41.320]  and Kev, this is super cool of you to give up
[02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:44.000]  on many levels,
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.680]  and I also just wanted to just note what you said,
[02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:48.160]  highlight what you said earlier,
[02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:50.600]  the folks that get both these packs,
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:53.600]  but you're gonna be communicating with them,
[02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:58.320]  and that's a fucking cool thing to have Kevin Jodry
[02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:01.600]  answer your fucking DM or text message.
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:05.400]  Any day he does, that's a fucking cool day to me.
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:06.320]  Cause it's rare.
[02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:09.760]  It's fucking rare man.
[02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:12.160]  You gotta fucking know you if I have to fuck around,
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:14.240]  but really it's just because of time.
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:18.440]  But the thing is that there's a lot of this stuff,
[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:19.600]  it isn't just moving product,
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:21.400]  it's really about building relationships,
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:23.800]  and assisting and helping in the way you can,
[02:37:23.800 --> 02:37:25.800]  and this is what we're doing right now,
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:27.920]  and with the people who pick up the stock,
[02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:28.880]  there's a lot of that stuff.
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:30.800]  People need to pick up the PK stock and stuff,
[02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:32.640]  same thing, we'll get your contacts,
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:34.800]  and then we'll all be able to kind of send a,
[02:37:35.760 --> 02:37:37.760]  it'll be good connection for y'all.
[02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:44.110]  So release the cracking.
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:56.120]  So Kev, the seed you just put up,
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:37:58.080]  it's got a special connection between me,
[02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:00.480]  you, Jackson, and Shango Lopes.
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:04.600]  Three years ago when I got sick,
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:07.240]  and I had to move out of Kentucky to Michigan,
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:10.400]  based off medical needs off the Poisson line,
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:12.560]  I'm listening to a shaping fire interview
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:16.320]  between Shango and Jackson,
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:20.520]  and I'd never, I went to prison for growing in 2003,
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:23.320]  so I stayed off the internet as far as growing stuff,
[02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:27.000]  but I'd moved to Michigan where it was legal to grow,
[02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:29.920]  for that reason, and I felt a safety
[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:32.720]  that I could be searching these things on the internet.
[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:36.360]  Jackson's talking about the black lime,
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:38.760]  and his powdered mildew resistance outdoors,
[02:38:38.760 --> 02:38:42.560]  and I took that into my medical needs, based off that,
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:46.280]  and then I found all the Meet the Breeder series from you,
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:48.560]  with all those people, and then I delved down
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:51.960]  this total Shango Lopes, Kevin Jodry,
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:56.240]  Mean Gene, Mandelbrot, Ben, Emerald Mountain, Hole,
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:38:59.520]  and then other guys from HBK to everything
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:02.800]  that was based off your Meet the Breeder series,
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:07.600]  so Black Lime Reserve is, when I jumped on a plane,
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:09.920]  and flew to California in the middle of the night,
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:12.760]  without anybody knowing, to get the rule seven cut,
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:14.280]  I still had a California ID,
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:16.720]  where I was training dogs out there in San Diego,
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:19.480]  to come out there and get that,
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:24.480]  and I went out to the dispensary in Ukiah,
[02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:27.840]  and was able to actually purchase some of Jackson's seeds,
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:29.760]  this was like two and a half years ago,
[02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:31.960]  and I was trying to do this before Shannon found out
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:34.560]  that I flew out there and went crazy,
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:38.440]  because I was on massive medical condition at the time,
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:41.240]  so this cut, these seeds,
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:43.240]  this holds special significance to me,
[02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:47.560]  these seeds are special in my life,
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:50.280]  based off of what they're capable of,
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:52.640]  I mean, from that, and delving that research,
[02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:54.000]  how I found the Royal,
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:57.240]  and everything based off of powdery mildew resistance,
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:39:58.920]  and the fact that it had traction,
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:00.800]  because it had worn some emerald cups,
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:03.600]  which was the reason I found it in the first place,
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:04.520]  was the fact that people
[02:40:04.520 --> 02:40:06.560]  would even make YouTube videos off of it,
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:11.840]  so mad props to Jackson on this,
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:14.000]  mad props to you for putting this up,
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.520]  but these are special seeds, man,
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:19.880]  and a lot of people have used these in different breedings,
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:22.840]  and I personally have searched for these seeds many times,
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:26.040]  and in pure form, it's something you're not gonna find,
[02:40:27.440 --> 02:40:30.640]  but a lot of work went into this black lime reserve,
[02:40:30.640 --> 02:40:34.000]  and the powdery mildew resistance,
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.920]  the borderitis resistance outdoors,
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:40.440]  that is even going past the recreational needs
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:44.000]  into medical needs, that has true needs there,
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.240]  so I just wanted to throw that in there.
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:49.160]  The other thing I was gonna toss in
[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:52.960]  is talking with Jackson about it,
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:58.280]  it breeds really well into a lot of stuff,
[02:40:58.280 --> 02:41:00.520]  he was getting a lot of stuff back from folks,
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:02.760]  and he hasn't done a lot of work breeding with it
[02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:03.720]  for whatever reason,
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:05.960]  but he was kind of like going,
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:07.080]  oh, maybe I should have,
[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:09.440]  because a lot of folks have been sending him stuff,
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:12.200]  and it's been really breeding really well.
[02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:13.880]  It was collaboration work,
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:17.880]  and so it was Leo and Ellie that had that chem dog special,
[02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:22.000]  and I think the chem dog special was like a star dog
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.560]  into like, was it a chem D?
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:27.440]  And so they had a nasty chem D up the hill,
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:29.520]  and Spiroc that they had run for years
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:31.280]  that was just ferocious,
[02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:34.040]  and I think they took a star dog and went into it,
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:36.520]  and pulled out something fucking ferocious,
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:37.360]  and then put it together,
[02:41:37.360 --> 02:41:38.680]  and then had a population,
[02:41:38.680 --> 02:41:39.800]  and then they put it together,
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:40.920]  and then they had a population,
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:41.760]  and then they put it together,
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:42.840]  and then had a population,
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:44.640]  because the female that I have is mean,
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:45.760]  but she's hella resistant,
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:48.000]  so she's long flowering,
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.280]  and which is like all chems,
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:51.520]  but this one doesn't have any issues outside,
[02:41:51.520 --> 02:41:54.040]  in the full rain, stunning,
[02:41:54.040 --> 02:41:59.040]  and the ability to catch the jarring again
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:01.680]  will never happen,
[02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:02.760]  so it's like a one time,
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:03.960]  that's why I held on to him.
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:08.000]  I gave away one of the container of it for another charity,
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:11.760]  because it was something that was important,
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:13.280]  and then here we go,
[02:42:13.280 --> 02:42:15.000]  and I think this was another important thing,
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:16.320]  because really it was just,
[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:19.080]  people ask for assistance,
[02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:20.600]  and they're only asking you to give them a hand
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:22.440]  to understand how to succeed.
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:26.800]  It's a really nice question,
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:29.160]  because then it allows the person that's asked
[02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:31.560]  to be able to kind of become creative,
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:32.480]  so when someone asks you,
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:34.200]  hey I need 20 bucks,
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:35.920]  it's different than when someone says,
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:38.800]  I need to know how to make 20 bucks,
[02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:40.560]  because now you can really sit down with them,
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:41.800]  and start to like figure out,
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:43.880]  let's how do we make 20 fucking bucks,
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:45.640]  because it's the skill that you need,
[02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:46.480]  not the money,
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:48.520]  the money is a result of the skill,
[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:50.600]  and I think that's the same way with some of the stock,
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:55.160]  is that you need the base stock to play these games.
[02:42:56.680 --> 02:42:58.720]  Black lime is something that you can break out
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:01.160]  in a joint anywhere,
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:02.800]  and when you blow that shit out,
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:05.560]  and that lime comes blasting out your nose,
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:07.760]  it's so sharp and astringent and clean,
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:09.320]  that it shocks people,
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:11.160]  because it went in as a fuel,
[02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:13.000]  and it comes out as a lime,
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:16.760]  there's a duality in its release that's unique,
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:18.640]  and you can shift it to more gassy,
[02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:20.600]  or you can go more limey,
[02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:23.520]  but the bottom line is that it's astringent and clean,
[02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:26.440]  and so we have a couple different cuts of it,
[02:43:27.360 --> 02:43:28.800]  expressions,
[02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:30.800]  and they're all killer,
[02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:32.800]  just what you prefer most,
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:34.440]  but the bottom line is it's something that to me,
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:36.760]  is like timeless grass,
[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:39.080]  we all like citrus,
[02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:41.400]  your body's programmed to go for it,
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:43.800]  but you don't get that clear, crisp lime,
[02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:47.680]  it's such a better buzz than going off of a lemon,
[02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:49.240]  and the orange is the same thing too,
[02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:50.280]  like I like a cherry,
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:52.040]  that's more of a stone fruit,
[02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:54.640]  but the citrus,
[02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:57.280]  the lemons and oranges to me are nice,
[02:43:57.280 --> 02:44:00.440]  but nowhere near the same as a clear lime,
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:01.280]  just exotic.
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:03.160]  Especially with the fuel on the front end,
[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:04.640]  I haven't had the black lime,
[02:44:04.640 --> 02:44:06.000]  but the way you describe it,
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:07.520]  and I'm just like fuck,
[02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:09.640]  and I'm imagining it as I'm looking through
[02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:11.720]  the Testarossa BLRs,
[02:44:11.720 --> 02:44:13.680]  I'm trying to find that,
[02:44:13.680 --> 02:44:16.720]  but the Testarossa comes through,
[02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:19.440]  that Skittles comes through so strong,
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:21.000]  I know it affects that flavor,
[02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:23.440]  one way or the other,
[02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:26.920]  I haven't found the strong lime,
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:29.120]  but I'm hoping I'll find some strong lime,
[02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:31.960]  in the lime cherry BX,
[02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:32.960]  totally,
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:37.320]  and I have the plant you wanna lay pollen into,
[02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:38.800]  to grab that,
[02:44:38.800 --> 02:44:41.160]  I have one that has almost like zero gas,
[02:44:41.160 --> 02:44:43.200]  it's almost all lime.
[02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:44.040]  Nice.
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:45.240]  So just quickly,
[02:44:45.240 --> 02:44:48.080]  we're at 3100 Kevin.
[02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:49.440]  Nice, good work.
[02:44:50.880 --> 02:44:53.920]  Yeah, I got some full size ones in the backyard,
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:56.920]  for the head smoke,
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:58.680]  cause for my Cali six,
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:00.760]  and so I did two cherry pies,
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:02.320]  two black limes,
[02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:04.640]  and two of the original Girl Scout,
[02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:06.280]  the one I've had forever,
[02:45:06.280 --> 02:45:09.040]  the very first release into the cookie world,
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:11.160]  because she kills it outside,
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:13.640]  but that black lime I grow it every year for myself,
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:16.600]  so I have something that when I smoke it,
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:17.720]  it makes me happy,
[02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:19.480]  it was,
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:22.320]  I discovered that when I wanted to get high,
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:23.720]  and feel an uplifting,
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:27.000]  just clear like cerebral,
[02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:28.880]  with a beautiful body,
[02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:31.160]  that's the one that really caught me,
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:33.760]  and so I have jars of it at the house all the time,
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:34.600]  so I always,
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:37.120]  when I wanna feel that nice uplifting clean high,
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:37.960]  that's sharp,
[02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:39.320]  I burn that,
[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:42.600]  and then when I wanna sit down with some deeper stuff,
[02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:44.680]  I can shift into the other pieces,
[02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:48.440]  cherry pie is more of a flavor with a good balance,
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:50.240]  and the cookie is just relaxing,
[02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:55.080]  and then I got a Congo that's just fucking searing,
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:45:57.360]  I got a Feroce,
[02:45:57.360 --> 02:45:58.960]  kills it here in Humboldt.
[02:45:58.960 --> 02:46:00.120]  Yeah.
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:02.400]  Your Congo that you've got,
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:05.520]  Kevin, that's different than Jackson's Congo.
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:06.600]  Yeah.
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:08.440]  Okay, Jackson gave me,
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:10.720]  I don't know about a hundred seeds of his Congo,
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:11.920]  at the regenerative conference,
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:13.400]  I'm about to crack them,
[02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:14.440]  but I heard you,
[02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:16.280]  and I think Tara Lee,
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:17.840]  talk about a Congo,
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:20.160]  but it sounded different than the way Jackson,
[02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:21.000]  had expressed his Congo.
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:21.840]  It is,
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:22.760]  it's a different cut,
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:24.360]  it's a different cut,
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:25.920]  this cut came out of,
[02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:30.640]  this Congo came out of a freighter,
[02:46:30.640 --> 02:46:32.520]  and a guy was a sailor on the freighter,
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:34.280]  grabbed some seed,
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:36.800]  and he goes and he takes it to an F4,
[02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:38.560]  in the Canary Islands,
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:39.800]  so off the coast of Africa,
[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:41.880]  the Canary Islands,
[02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:43.360]  this guy lives there,
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:44.920]  and he takes it to the F4,
[02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:48.720]  he pulls out this unbelievable cutting,
[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:50.680]  it then goes to Canada,
[02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:53.240]  and it's held by this dude named Vision Creator,
[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:54.640]  for like 20 years,
[02:46:55.480 --> 02:46:58.160]  and he wanted to release it into the world,
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:46:59.680]  so that people could get their hands on,
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:01.000]  this unbelievable plant,
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.680]  because it grows phenomenally well,
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:04.760]  I mean holy fuck,
[02:47:04.760 --> 02:47:06.720]  it just it's a growing dream,
[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:08.840]  and it takes a hundred days in dorm,
[02:47:08.840 --> 02:47:10.840]  it's deep November,
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:12.880]  but it's fine,
[02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:14.680]  it's worth every fucking minute of it,
[02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:15.720]  to grow that plant,
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:18.720]  because it just does everything you want it to do,
[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:22.040]  and the Tara gave me copy,
[02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:24.120]  and then I gave a bunch out at the regen conference,
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:25.920]  and then Vision Creator hit me up online,
[02:47:25.920 --> 02:47:27.920]  and said hey man I heard you were giving them out,
[02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:29.800]  he goes please continue,
[02:47:29.800 --> 02:47:32.320]  so we propped a shitload of them at the last conference,
[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:35.280]  I just cut a whole mom into slips,
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:36.920]  and then we wet bagged them,
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:40.080]  so that people at the conference could take a copy home,
[02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:43.000]  because you need to have stuff like this,
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:46.160]  and it's the same thing with the black line man,
[02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:48.840]  these things are not in circulation,
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:52.520]  you're not getting the selection process,
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:55.560]  and when you have them in your own library,
[02:47:55.560 --> 02:47:57.520]  it lets you swing a direction,
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:47:59.520]  that you just can't swing normally,
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:01.600]  you can't just go find it.
[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:06.600]  I may have the sky cuddler push on the Congo,
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:10.400]  and I think I'm pretty sure I sent you Nick,
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:12.680]  the TKG 13 on the Congo.
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:17.320]  We just hit 4k on the black lime reserve seeds,
[02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:20.680]  4100 from Staten Island Villa,

[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:45.200]  like launching somebody's dream,
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:46.720]  and that's a beautiful fucking thing,
[02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:49.160]  so you guys hit me up on Instagram man,

[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:12.320]  capture the email,
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:13.600]  because hit me on DM,

[02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:15.720]  I can't respond,
[02:49:15.720 --> 02:49:18.560]  and then I forget what platform I talked to you on,
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:19.400]  like what platform,
[02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:20.720]  because I'm on a bunch of them,
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:23.080]  so those are things like we can see each other,

[02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:32.680]  but on the social media back ends,

[02:49:51.640 --> 02:49:52.480]  the other ones,

[02:53:49.250 --> 02:53:50.930]  You guys wanna,
[02:53:50.930 --> 02:53:53.570]  talk a little bit more about the,
[02:53:53.570 --> 02:53:55.010]  let's start with the coffee.
[02:53:55.890 --> 02:53:56.970]  I'll tell you about the coffee,
[02:53:56.970 --> 02:53:58.370]  and I don't know what the lineage of it,
[02:53:58.370 --> 02:54:00.210]  but I'll tell you about the smoke.
[02:54:00.210 --> 02:54:01.050]  But first of all,
[02:54:01.050 --> 02:54:02.970]  what do you wanna start it at?
[02:54:02.970 --> 02:54:04.690]  Oh, you gotta go at least three bills,
[02:54:04.690 --> 02:54:06.810]  cause they retail for three bills.
[02:54:06.810 --> 02:54:07.650]  Yeah.
[02:54:07.650 --> 02:54:08.490]  Yeah.
[02:54:08.490 --> 02:54:09.450]  This shit goes for money.
[02:54:09.450 --> 02:54:11.330]  I don't know the lineage on it,
[02:54:11.330 --> 02:54:12.210]  other than,
[02:54:13.770 --> 02:54:14.610]  he's,
[02:54:14.610 --> 02:54:16.530]  it's stuff that he got from his mentor,
[02:54:16.530 --> 02:54:17.690]  that he worked,
[02:54:17.690 --> 02:54:19.050]  and he found some cool stuff,
[02:54:19.050 --> 02:54:20.370]  on his first breeding,
[02:54:20.370 --> 02:54:21.450]  and he worked at and worked at,
[02:54:21.450 --> 02:54:22.850]  and he's been working it.
[02:54:22.850 --> 02:54:24.330]  And it's been his like flagship,
[02:54:24.330 --> 02:54:26.930]  which I super respect out of a person,
[02:54:26.930 --> 02:54:28.770]  a breeder to like really work on one thing.
[02:54:28.770 --> 02:54:29.610]  And that's his,
[02:54:29.610 --> 02:54:30.610]  it's kind of his goal in life.
[02:54:30.610 --> 02:54:32.090]  And he does a lot of other stuff,
[02:54:32.090 --> 02:54:33.130]  a lot of really cool stuff,
[02:54:33.130 --> 02:54:34.490]  but this is his thing.
[02:54:34.490 --> 02:54:35.330]  He's cubed it,
[02:54:35.330 --> 02:54:38.370]  he's IBL that he's put it into stuff.
[02:54:38.370 --> 02:54:39.250]  It's,
[02:54:39.250 --> 02:54:40.570]  but when I smoked it,
[02:54:40.570 --> 02:54:43.010]  it's the same thing that ties me out,
[02:54:43.010 --> 02:54:45.570]  on all the strains that I find benefit from,
[02:54:45.570 --> 02:54:46.490]  that I wanna smoke.
[02:54:46.490 --> 02:54:47.330]  That I talk about,
[02:54:47.330 --> 02:54:48.170]  I've talked with you,
[02:54:48.170 --> 02:54:49.010]  Kevin about it,
[02:54:49.010 --> 02:54:50.490]  I've talked with Nick about it.
[02:54:50.490 --> 02:54:51.610]  Tyler, we've talked about it.
[02:54:51.610 --> 02:54:53.690]  It's that GG4,
[02:54:53.690 --> 02:54:55.690]  the chem dog thing,
[02:54:55.690 --> 02:54:56.770]  that's pushing through.
[02:54:56.770 --> 02:54:58.010]  I don't know if there's chem in it,
[02:54:58.010 --> 02:55:00.050]  but it's that coffee.
[02:55:01.090 --> 02:55:02.090]  I mean, it's called coffee,
[02:55:02.090 --> 02:55:03.770]  but it's chocolatey,
[02:55:03.770 --> 02:55:05.610]  marshmallowy,
[02:55:05.610 --> 02:55:07.250]  but it has some gas to it.
[02:55:07.250 --> 02:55:09.170]  You know, when I had the hash on it.
[02:55:09.170 --> 02:55:10.370]  It's complex.
[02:55:10.370 --> 02:55:11.370]  It's complex, dude.
[02:55:11.370 --> 02:55:12.210]  It's really fucking cool.
[02:55:12.210 --> 02:55:13.050]  And it pushes through.
[02:55:13.050 --> 02:55:13.890]  It's like the dog walker.
[02:55:13.890 --> 02:55:15.050]  It's like the dog walker.
[02:55:15.090 --> 02:55:15.930]  And you just like,
[02:55:15.930 --> 02:55:16.770]  that's it.
[02:55:16.770 --> 02:55:18.010]  Dog walker, gorilla glue,
[02:55:18.010 --> 02:55:19.210]  coffee, like those are,
[02:55:19.210 --> 02:55:21.610]  I had the desert island three.
[02:55:21.610 --> 02:55:22.450]  It would be those.
[02:55:22.450 --> 02:55:24.010]  And they're so damn similar,
[02:55:24.010 --> 02:55:25.290]  but that would be where I'd go.
[02:55:25.290 --> 02:55:26.250]  Like desert island.
[02:55:26.250 --> 02:55:27.850]  What do you wanna smoke for the rest of your life?
[02:55:27.850 --> 02:55:28.970]  Coffee, dog walker,
[02:55:28.970 --> 02:55:30.090]  and gorilla glue,
[02:55:30.090 --> 02:55:31.210]  all day.
[02:55:31.210 --> 02:55:32.890]  And swirl them together in some.
[02:55:32.890 --> 02:55:33.730]  Yeah.
[02:55:35.730 --> 02:55:39.250]  I know that coffee is an Afghani originally.
[02:55:39.250 --> 02:55:40.770]  I think it's the alien Afghani,
[02:55:40.770 --> 02:55:41.650]  the alien genetics,
[02:55:41.650 --> 02:55:44.090]  but I don't know what else it's got in there.
[02:55:44.130 --> 02:55:46.450]  But that's what I know about the coffee.
[02:55:48.210 --> 02:55:49.050]  Gotcha.
[02:55:49.050 --> 02:55:49.890]  Gotcha.
[02:55:49.890 --> 02:55:51.610]  And the alien tech first came out.
[02:55:51.610 --> 02:55:52.450]  Yep.
[02:55:56.930 --> 02:55:57.810]  And what's the Matterhorn?
[02:55:57.810 --> 02:55:59.770]  Is there a listing on that?
[02:55:59.770 --> 02:56:01.610]  It's his BX is what he's called.
[02:56:01.610 --> 02:56:03.010]  It's the Matterhorn is what he's called.
[02:56:03.010 --> 02:56:03.850]  It's BX.
[02:56:03.850 --> 02:56:05.650]  I thought that was the other one.
[02:56:05.650 --> 02:56:06.610]  Gotcha.
[02:56:06.610 --> 02:56:07.450]  Yeah.
[02:56:07.450 --> 02:56:08.730]  He's done IBLs.
[02:56:08.730 --> 02:56:10.050]  He's done BXs.
[02:56:13.890 --> 02:56:15.570]  I told you last week, Josh.
[02:56:15.570 --> 02:56:16.410]  So what,
[02:56:16.410 --> 02:56:17.770]  what's a coffee cube?
[02:56:17.770 --> 02:56:18.610]  That's,
[02:56:18.610 --> 02:56:20.290]  I shouldn't be able to explain that better,
[02:56:20.290 --> 02:56:21.130]  but.
[02:56:23.010 --> 02:56:25.010]  It's back cross four times.
[02:56:25.890 --> 02:56:27.010]  That's a cube, right?
[02:56:27.010 --> 02:56:29.650]  I've got the coffee cube going in beds right now
[02:56:30.610 --> 02:56:33.050]  that Kai gave me out there at the Bimbo Inn
[02:56:33.050 --> 02:56:35.170]  when we were all hanging out on the porch.
[02:56:36.490 --> 02:56:38.730]  But I believe it's back cross four times.
[02:56:38.730 --> 02:56:39.570]  So.
[02:56:41.010 --> 02:56:42.010]  Yeah.
[02:56:42.010 --> 02:56:43.170]  Yeah, that's the idea.
[02:56:43.610 --> 02:56:44.690]  Right in that same,
[02:56:44.690 --> 02:56:46.210]  basically in that same female,
[02:56:46.210 --> 02:56:47.050]  if I got it right,
[02:56:47.050 --> 02:56:48.170]  it's back into that same female
[02:56:48.170 --> 02:56:50.170]  that he originally pulled that he's kept.
[02:56:52.610 --> 02:56:53.450]  Yeah.
[02:56:53.450 --> 02:56:54.290]  Speaking of the.
[02:56:54.290 --> 02:56:55.490]  Hey, Beef is not to be with.
[02:56:56.930 --> 02:56:59.170]  Speaking of the Bimbo Inn, Kev,
[02:56:59.170 --> 02:57:00.010]  here's the.
[02:57:00.010 --> 02:57:01.330]  Oh, you still got the fucking robe.
[02:57:01.330 --> 02:57:02.170]  Oh.
[02:57:02.170 --> 02:57:04.690]  The fucking robe that I accidentally packed up
[02:57:04.690 --> 02:57:09.690]  and they charged me $1,100 for this fucking robe.
[02:57:09.730 --> 02:57:10.570]  So.
[02:57:10.690 --> 02:57:11.530]  So yeah.
[02:57:11.530 --> 02:57:13.370]  That is awesome, dude.
[02:57:13.370 --> 02:57:15.570]  So Shannon wears that robe every day.
[02:57:15.570 --> 02:57:17.970]  That is a major prized possession in this house.
[02:57:17.970 --> 02:57:20.370]  It cost more than my first fucking car.
[02:57:20.370 --> 02:57:21.210]  It's a funny fucking,
[02:57:21.210 --> 02:57:23.010]  they got you for 1,100 for a robe.
[02:57:23.010 --> 02:57:24.330]  That's unbelievable.
[02:57:24.330 --> 02:57:25.170]  Fucking Bimbo.
[02:57:25.170 --> 02:57:26.010]  Yeah, man.
[02:57:26.010 --> 02:57:26.850]  Yeah.
[02:57:26.850 --> 02:57:27.690]  Welcome to Sun.
[02:57:27.690 --> 02:57:29.930]  Yeah, they hit me hard, man.
[02:57:29.930 --> 02:57:30.770]  Yeah.
[02:57:30.770 --> 02:57:31.610]  Yeah, it was a wonderful time.
[02:57:31.610 --> 02:57:32.450]  The room's only 120.
[02:57:32.450 --> 02:57:35.050]  I got a call on the top two about.
[02:57:35.050 --> 02:57:35.890]  Yeah, the room's only 120.
[02:57:35.890 --> 02:57:36.730]  About what they charge you.
[02:57:36.730 --> 02:57:37.570]  Yeah, I got a call on the top two
[02:57:37.570 --> 02:57:38.410]  about what they charge you.
[02:57:38.410 --> 02:57:39.250]  Yeah, I got a call on the top two
[02:57:39.690 --> 02:57:41.490]  about what they charge me for the robe
[02:57:41.490 --> 02:57:42.330]  and they were like,
[02:57:42.330 --> 02:57:43.690]  we came out there and told you four times
[02:57:43.690 --> 02:57:45.290]  to quit smoking weed on the porch.
[02:57:45.290 --> 02:57:46.290]  You know, and I'm like,
[02:57:46.290 --> 02:57:48.770]  there were 13 guys who smoked four pounds of weed
[02:57:48.770 --> 02:57:50.010]  on that porch in an hour.
[02:57:50.010 --> 02:57:51.610]  You're gonna blame it all on me.
[02:57:51.610 --> 02:57:54.250]  But yeah, it was a fun time.
[02:57:54.250 --> 02:57:56.490]  It was probably one of the best days I ever had in my life.
[02:57:56.490 --> 02:57:57.330]  So.
[02:57:59.810 --> 02:58:02.010]  Somebody's gotta take the hit for everybody.
[02:58:02.890 --> 02:58:05.490]  Might as well give it to the guy having seizures.
[02:58:06.530 --> 02:58:07.370]  Man, I was out there.
[02:58:07.450 --> 02:58:09.250]  It wasn't just that.
[02:58:09.250 --> 02:58:10.850]  I got to be out there with Nathan,
[02:58:10.850 --> 02:58:13.330]  another fellow that has Lyme disease.
[02:58:13.330 --> 02:58:15.890]  So it was just a good time, man.
[02:58:15.890 --> 02:58:20.570]  That was the highlight of everything for me
[02:58:20.570 --> 02:58:22.090]  last year through General Conference.
[02:58:22.090 --> 02:58:23.530]  Nathan's cool.
[02:58:23.530 --> 02:58:25.210]  And that speaks to just everybody.
[02:58:25.210 --> 02:58:26.250]  Nathan's a good dude, man.
[02:58:26.250 --> 02:58:28.610]  He's a good dude.
[02:58:28.610 --> 02:58:31.410]  Dude, I'm gonna text you some of his Topanga
[02:58:31.410 --> 02:58:32.610]  that's outdoors right now.
[02:58:32.610 --> 02:58:37.010]  They're 12 foot tall, about nine or 10 foot wide.
[02:58:37.530 --> 02:58:38.530]  Really, really nice.
[02:58:39.650 --> 02:58:40.490]  Really nice.
[02:58:40.490 --> 02:58:41.370]  Yeah, no, that's a good OG.
[02:58:41.370 --> 02:58:42.770]  He's got a killer OG.
[02:58:42.770 --> 02:58:44.690]  That bad boy loves.
[02:58:44.690 --> 02:58:46.610]  It's got exceptional vigor.
[02:58:47.530 --> 02:58:48.370]  Uniquely vigorous.
[02:58:48.370 --> 02:58:49.410]  It's stretched stupid.
[02:58:49.410 --> 02:58:51.410]  So we had a double stack.
[02:58:53.090 --> 02:58:54.250]  Man, I come from Kentucky
[02:58:54.250 --> 02:58:55.650]  where it was old school gorilla growing.
[02:58:55.650 --> 02:58:57.730]  This is only my second year full sun.
[02:58:57.730 --> 02:58:59.770]  So some of these techniques are a little different
[02:58:59.770 --> 02:59:01.610]  as far as gorilla growing to full sun.
[02:59:01.610 --> 02:59:06.370]  And we stacked two sets of farm fence on one of them up.
[02:59:06.410 --> 02:59:10.530]  So it goes up, well, 11 foot, right, Shannon?
[02:59:10.530 --> 02:59:13.090]  With these big monster posts in there.
[02:59:13.090 --> 02:59:15.930]  And it just stretches and flops everywhere.
[02:59:15.930 --> 02:59:20.450]  But it produces the gaseous lemon flower
[02:59:20.450 --> 02:59:23.090]  that it's like lemon pledge
[02:59:23.090 --> 02:59:24.730]  with a little OG on the back end.
[02:59:24.730 --> 02:59:26.850]  I mean, it's just a wonderful smoke.
[02:59:27.850 --> 02:59:28.850]  You got a good cut, man.
[02:59:28.850 --> 02:59:30.090]  No, I like it too.
[02:59:30.090 --> 02:59:31.450]  I do like that OG.
[02:59:32.650 --> 02:59:34.930]  And he's a character, man.
[02:59:34.930 --> 02:59:36.410]  Mean homie, mean homie hit each other.
[02:59:36.410 --> 02:59:38.290]  We chat online once in a while.
[02:59:38.290 --> 02:59:41.130]  Yeah, I try to get him to come out here for the summer.
[02:59:41.130 --> 02:59:42.610]  But you can never talk.
[02:59:42.610 --> 02:59:43.450]  No.
[02:59:48.530 --> 02:59:50.650]  I was saying he's doing a cool thing in Washington.
[02:59:50.650 --> 02:59:52.410]  He's really pushing the hashing
[02:59:54.130 --> 02:59:57.530]  where it kind of ended when they killed medical.
[02:59:57.530 --> 02:59:58.930]  Yeah.
[02:59:58.930 --> 03:00:01.210]  Cuban was out here and I was out here
[03:00:01.210 --> 03:00:02.370]  and I had a guy working for me
[03:00:02.370 --> 03:00:03.690]  making hash off my stuff
[03:00:03.690 --> 03:00:06.050]  that we were doing really well with.
[03:00:06.050 --> 03:00:09.450]  And Danksar and there was a couple others
[03:00:10.450 --> 03:00:12.770]  that were doing in the medical market,
[03:00:12.770 --> 03:00:13.730]  it was really cool shit.
[03:00:13.730 --> 03:00:18.730]  And right when Rosin was coming out, you know, 2014, 15.
[03:00:19.210 --> 03:00:22.330]  And then they shut that all down and most everybody left.
[03:00:22.330 --> 03:00:24.450]  And I kind of saw, in my mind,
[03:00:24.450 --> 03:00:27.770]  I looked at Rosin and I thought in like six months, a year,
[03:00:27.770 --> 03:00:29.890]  they were gonna be driving tractors to the field
[03:00:29.970 --> 03:00:31.570]  that were like mowing down weed
[03:00:31.570 --> 03:00:33.250]  and that spitting Rosin out the back end.
[03:00:33.250 --> 03:00:34.410]  I was like, I ain't fucking
[03:00:34.410 --> 03:00:36.450]  with these hair straighteners anymore.
[03:00:36.450 --> 03:00:37.370]  You know what I mean?
[03:00:37.370 --> 03:00:38.650]  That's what I envisioned right away.
[03:00:38.650 --> 03:00:39.850]  And I think that's still to come,
[03:00:39.850 --> 03:00:43.330]  but probably not competing with what we're doing.
[03:00:43.330 --> 03:00:46.010]  I see, you know, Ganja Gil and Bubble Man
[03:00:46.010 --> 03:00:47.690]  and all these guys fucking doing right now.
[03:00:47.690 --> 03:00:50.730]  And this is next level, cool shit.
[03:00:52.770 --> 03:00:53.610]  Yeah, Gil too.
[03:00:53.610 --> 03:00:58.210]  Kaya came in, so I kind of gave up and took my tail
[03:00:58.210 --> 03:00:59.490]  and just like, I'm gonna do my thing.
[03:01:00.450 --> 03:01:04.530]  And Kaya came into the rec market and brought in the game.
[03:01:04.530 --> 03:01:06.130]  He was like, no, no, you know,
[03:01:06.130 --> 03:01:08.050]  I know you guys are used to this BHO shit,
[03:01:08.050 --> 03:01:09.130]  but I have a different product.
[03:01:09.130 --> 03:01:12.810]  And he was the fucking sole person that changed the game
[03:01:12.810 --> 03:01:15.290]  of concentrate in Washington state a couple of years ago.
[03:01:15.290 --> 03:01:17.370]  He came in and pushed a better product.
[03:01:17.370 --> 03:01:18.530]  He demanded a top dollar.
[03:01:18.530 --> 03:01:20.730]  He told the retailers they're gonna have to suck it up
[03:01:20.730 --> 03:01:23.250]  and suck up a little bit less of the profit
[03:01:23.250 --> 03:01:24.370]  and to move this product.
[03:01:24.370 --> 03:01:26.130]  And they did, and it changed the fucking game.
[03:01:26.170 --> 03:01:29.210]  Now we have five, 10, 15, you know,
[03:01:29.210 --> 03:01:31.450]  and in Washington small, I know you guys are a lot bigger.
[03:01:31.450 --> 03:01:34.410]  We only have 600 some growers tops, you know,
[03:01:34.410 --> 03:01:38.210]  and I mean like probably 400 processors.
[03:01:38.210 --> 03:01:41.090]  And so, you know, in the whole fucking state.
[03:01:41.090 --> 03:01:44.210]  So the fact that we have like six to 10 people
[03:01:44.210 --> 03:01:46.210]  putting out hash, you know,
[03:01:46.210 --> 03:01:49.450]  and Roz and Kaya fucking started that shit in a way,
[03:01:49.450 --> 03:01:50.290]  you know what I mean?
[03:01:50.290 --> 03:01:51.890]  You know, he kind of got that moving back in the market.
[03:01:51.890 --> 03:01:53.730]  He literally did it.
[03:01:53.890 --> 03:01:54.730]  He literally did it.
[03:01:54.730 --> 03:01:55.850]  He took the pricing.
[03:01:55.850 --> 03:01:59.570]  He took BHO from a higher level and fucking shifted it.
[03:01:59.570 --> 03:02:00.410]  He fucked it.
[03:02:00.410 --> 03:02:01.250]  He fucked it.
[03:02:01.250 --> 03:02:02.850]  And he's like, nope, I'm taking 30, 35.
[03:02:02.850 --> 03:02:03.730]  And you guys are gonna have to,
[03:02:03.730 --> 03:02:05.250]  on the retail and you're gonna have to suck it up.
[03:02:05.250 --> 03:02:07.130]  You know, you'll get your money on the weed end.
[03:02:07.130 --> 03:02:09.570]  And this is a better product.
[03:02:09.570 --> 03:02:11.330]  And they fucking ate it.
[03:02:11.330 --> 03:02:13.810]  And it changed the whole market for everybody.
[03:02:13.810 --> 03:02:16.250]  Even the guys doing BHO diamonds and stuff,
[03:02:16.250 --> 03:02:17.610]  it changed it for everybody.
[03:02:17.610 --> 03:02:18.450]  Oh, completely.
[03:02:18.450 --> 03:02:21.170]  I burned a bunch of it at the room with us.
[03:02:21.170 --> 03:02:23.290]  He ever actually, you know,
[03:02:23.810 --> 03:02:24.930]  he never got to reap that benefit
[03:02:24.930 --> 03:02:26.410]  because it didn't work out with the company
[03:02:26.410 --> 03:02:27.770]  he did that with.
[03:02:27.770 --> 03:02:30.570]  But now he's got in with a new company,
[03:02:30.570 --> 03:02:31.930]  some awesome people.
[03:02:31.930 --> 03:02:34.690]  Their second summer in and they're doing cool shit.
[03:02:34.690 --> 03:02:35.730]  And he's making hash.
[03:02:35.730 --> 03:02:37.330]  Like I talked to him a couple of days ago
[03:02:37.330 --> 03:02:38.210]  for about two minutes.
[03:02:38.210 --> 03:02:39.730]  He'll call me and he'll be driving.
[03:02:39.730 --> 03:02:41.210]  He's working so hard.
[03:02:41.210 --> 03:02:42.050]  What are you doing, man?
[03:02:42.050 --> 03:02:43.530]  He's like, oh, it's 120 out.
[03:02:43.530 --> 03:02:45.330]  And I'm fucking in the hash lab.
[03:02:45.330 --> 03:02:46.810]  I've been washing, washing, washing.
[03:02:46.810 --> 03:02:48.650]  And he's just, you know, he's working hard.
[03:02:48.650 --> 03:02:51.450]  And so I just gotta give him a ton of props, dude.
[03:02:51.490 --> 03:02:53.930]  Like he is pushing cool shit in the Washington scene.
[03:02:53.930 --> 03:02:56.530]  Pacific Northwest roots here in Washington State.
[03:02:56.530 --> 03:03:00.330]  Go find a store that has Pacific Northwest roots in it.
[03:03:00.330 --> 03:03:01.890]  For sure.
[03:03:01.890 --> 03:03:03.810]  And just quickly,
[03:03:03.810 --> 03:03:06.530]  so we have a winner for the Coffee Cubes.
[03:03:10.110 --> 03:03:10.950]  Cascadian.
[03:03:10.950 --> 03:03:11.790]  Louie?
[03:03:12.710 --> 03:03:16.470]  Yeah, Jonathan, I just lost his name.
[03:03:16.470 --> 03:03:17.670]  It was 450.
[03:03:19.590 --> 03:03:20.950]  Jonathan Davis.
[03:03:21.950 --> 03:03:24.110]  Second donation tonight.
[03:03:24.110 --> 03:03:25.710]  Yeah, and Jonathan,
[03:03:25.710 --> 03:03:28.670]  so that's where you can go to make your donation.
[03:03:28.670 --> 03:03:33.550]  And we got one more from Kaya.
[03:03:33.550 --> 03:03:34.390]  What?
[03:03:34.390 --> 03:03:35.230]  Let me.
[03:03:35.950 --> 03:03:38.750]  And then we also have someone else
[03:03:38.750 --> 03:03:40.110]  who may jump on imminently
[03:03:40.110 --> 03:03:41.790]  who's gonna give some seeds away.
[03:03:43.710 --> 03:03:45.470]  Let me cue that up again.
[03:03:45.470 --> 03:03:47.670]  So let me just tell you guys,
[03:03:47.670 --> 03:03:50.910]  like we're just under $9,000 right now.
[03:03:51.870 --> 03:03:52.710]  Wow.
[03:03:53.790 --> 03:03:56.870]  That exceeds our goal by about eight times,
[03:03:56.870 --> 03:03:59.550]  seven and a half times, to be honest.
[03:03:59.550 --> 03:04:01.030]  Like from what Delano was kind of,
[03:04:01.030 --> 03:04:02.350]  we told him what we would get.
[03:04:02.350 --> 03:04:04.830]  We're like, we'll probably get around 1,500 bucks.
[03:04:04.830 --> 03:04:06.230]  I knew, Kevin and I both knew
[03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:07.230]  it was gonna go for a lot more,
[03:04:07.230 --> 03:04:08.230]  but you know what I'm saying?
[03:04:08.230 --> 03:04:10.870]  Like he thought he was gonna get a little jumpstart.
[03:04:10.870 --> 03:04:12.910]  This is gonna launch his fucking thing
[03:04:12.910 --> 03:04:14.870]  and you guys are fucking awesome.
[03:04:14.870 --> 03:04:15.710]  I appreciate it.
[03:04:15.710 --> 03:04:17.790]  He's gonna wake up in the morning.
[03:04:17.790 --> 03:04:18.630]  Yeah.
[03:04:18.630 --> 03:04:20.390]  And look at his PayPal.
[03:04:20.390 --> 03:04:22.110]  So if I get this right,
[03:04:22.110 --> 03:04:25.830]  the Matterhorn is the coffee back cross four.
[03:04:25.830 --> 03:04:27.150]  Is that what we're doing here?
[03:04:27.150 --> 03:04:27.990]  Mm-hmm.
[03:04:34.170 --> 03:04:35.770]  So now we're, all right.
[03:04:35.770 --> 03:04:38.210]  So someone won the coffee cube
[03:04:38.210 --> 03:04:40.570]  and now we're onto the Matterhorn.
[03:04:40.570 --> 03:04:42.010]  Oh, the Matterhorn is separate.
[03:04:42.010 --> 03:04:42.850]  I, yeah, I got you.
[03:04:42.850 --> 03:04:43.690]  Yeah.
[03:04:43.690 --> 03:04:44.890]  What's the Matterhorn then?
[03:04:44.890 --> 03:04:46.130]  Is Kai gonna pop on?
[03:04:47.010 --> 03:04:48.450]  Well, I'm, I,
[03:04:49.450 --> 03:04:50.290]  let me,
[03:04:51.490 --> 03:04:52.610]  whoops.
[03:04:52.610 --> 03:04:54.010]  Let me check with him.
[03:04:54.010 --> 03:04:57.050]  But I also,
[03:04:57.050 --> 03:04:58.250]  Chadwick,
[03:04:59.930 --> 03:05:01.330]  if you're watching,
[03:05:01.330 --> 03:05:04.610]  I sent you a link to jump on.
[03:05:06.930 --> 03:05:08.010]  Anyway, all right.
[03:05:08.010 --> 03:05:09.490]  Why don't you guys talk for a minute
[03:05:09.490 --> 03:05:12.170]  and I'm gonna try to track him down.
[03:05:12.170 --> 03:05:13.450]  I'll tell you what the Matterhorn is.
[03:05:13.450 --> 03:05:15.090]  I just looked it up on his Instagram.
[03:05:15.090 --> 03:05:19.050]  It's the triangle cush cross the coffee BX three.
[03:05:19.050 --> 03:05:19.890]  Ooh.
[03:05:20.730 --> 03:05:21.570]  Yeah.
[03:05:21.570 --> 03:05:23.010]  Oh, that's a good one.
[03:05:23.130 --> 03:05:25.050]  That's a really good one, dude.
[03:05:25.050 --> 03:05:26.650]  Oh man, that's a good one.
[03:05:26.650 --> 03:05:29.130]  The TK into the coffee would be really nice
[03:05:29.130 --> 03:05:31.570]  because the TK breeds interestingly.
[03:05:33.170 --> 03:05:37.170]  It brings out, it's just different edges.
[03:05:37.170 --> 03:05:39.050]  Do we know what to start this one at?
[03:05:40.010 --> 03:05:41.770]  I would start at 300.
[03:05:41.770 --> 03:05:42.610]  Okay.
[03:05:42.610 --> 03:05:43.450]  Start at the same price
[03:05:43.450 --> 03:05:45.130]  because I think that's the factory retail.
[03:05:48.430 --> 03:05:51.590]  Peter, they're requesting the PayPal information again.
[03:05:52.590 --> 03:05:54.190]  Give me one second.
[03:05:54.190 --> 03:05:55.550]  Mike got them.
[03:05:55.550 --> 03:05:56.870]  Yeah, and it's interesting.
[03:05:56.870 --> 03:05:59.270]  Peter's, the folks that have been on the show
[03:05:59.270 --> 03:06:01.150]  the last week or so,
[03:06:01.150 --> 03:06:02.630]  I listened, we all listened, dude.
[03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:04.910]  We just love the folks you have on, Peter.
[03:06:04.910 --> 03:06:06.270]  It keeps us going during the day.
[03:06:06.270 --> 03:06:07.990]  It's fucking fun to, I mean,
[03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:13.430]  anyways, the TK has been talked about a lot
[03:06:13.430 --> 03:06:15.190]  and a lot of folks working with the TK
[03:06:15.190 --> 03:06:16.590]  and breeding with the TK.
[03:06:16.590 --> 03:06:19.990]  And, you know, I was stoked to get those seeds
[03:06:20.310 --> 03:06:25.310]  from Tim, Bio Tim, the TKG13s.
[03:06:25.310 --> 03:06:28.110]  Anyways, just kind of talking about it,
[03:06:28.110 --> 03:06:28.950]  shoot the shit.
[03:06:30.790 --> 03:06:35.790]  So, anyway, here's, all right.
[03:06:35.950 --> 03:06:40.230]  So here's where to go to either make even a small donation
[03:06:40.230 --> 03:06:43.790]  or to pay for your seeds.
[03:06:43.790 --> 03:06:45.950]  We're currently on the Matterhorn.
[03:06:46.950 --> 03:06:51.150]  And then, so Chadwick Rhodes,
[03:06:51.150 --> 03:06:52.990]  he's on the East Coast in Maine.
[03:06:52.990 --> 03:06:54.430]  It's 11.15 at night.
[03:06:54.430 --> 03:06:59.430]  He's going to bed, but he is gonna donate.
[03:07:04.300 --> 03:07:06.820]  He said, Kev holds the female L13
[03:07:06.820 --> 03:07:08.260]  and crossed it with something.
[03:07:08.260 --> 03:07:11.340]  I ran NYC Diesel into it.
[03:07:11.340 --> 03:07:16.340]  And he, in the chat somewhere, said what he was donating.
[03:07:16.340 --> 03:07:18.220]  Oh, that's the Louis XIII.
[03:07:18.220 --> 03:07:19.380]  Yeah, the Louis XIII.
[03:07:19.380 --> 03:07:20.220]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:07:20.220 --> 03:07:22.260]  Yeah, I think, you know what I did is I think I sent him,
[03:07:22.260 --> 03:07:26.860]  I think he got from me a real land race Afi
[03:07:26.860 --> 03:07:31.020]  that one of my partners brought back from Afghanistan
[03:07:31.020 --> 03:07:32.980]  when he was in the war.
[03:07:32.980 --> 03:07:35.700]  And so actually it was the dad that I was friends with
[03:07:35.700 --> 03:07:38.740]  and the son brought the stock back for his dad
[03:07:38.740 --> 03:07:41.580]  and the son let me grab the stuff
[03:07:41.580 --> 03:07:42.980]  because he knew that I could hold it better
[03:07:42.980 --> 03:07:43.980]  than his pops could.
[03:07:44.980 --> 03:07:47.420]  And so I had this week,
[03:07:47.420 --> 03:07:50.420]  I had a really nice true Afghani from Afghanistan,
[03:07:50.420 --> 03:07:52.100]  like hand carried over.
[03:07:52.100 --> 03:07:54.740]  And then I had the Louis XIII cut
[03:07:54.740 --> 03:07:59.740]  and it is the same thing as like the TK in a sense
[03:07:59.820 --> 03:08:01.340]  where it's got, and the dog walker,
[03:08:01.340 --> 03:08:03.660]  it's got like a unique profile to it.
[03:08:03.660 --> 03:08:06.220]  When you puff it, it's different.
[03:08:06.220 --> 03:08:08.740]  It was priceless at one point in the game.
[03:08:08.740 --> 03:08:10.300]  And the Louis is killer.
[03:08:10.340 --> 03:08:12.660]  Who's got a good copy of the Louis?
[03:08:12.660 --> 03:08:14.820]  Full Moon Farms.
[03:08:14.820 --> 03:08:17.300]  Full Moon Farms has got that copy in form
[03:08:17.300 --> 03:08:20.220]  where I hooked them up with the true Louis
[03:08:20.220 --> 03:08:24.220]  and they run it out of their farm.
[03:08:24.220 --> 03:08:26.580]  And so it's in the dispensaries, but it's beautiful,
[03:08:26.580 --> 03:08:29.340]  good killer ass fucking OG.
[03:08:29.340 --> 03:08:31.540]  And into that Afghani and the Afghani
[03:08:31.540 --> 03:08:33.620]  kind of brought the size down a little bit
[03:08:33.620 --> 03:08:35.540]  in terms of height and stretch
[03:08:35.540 --> 03:08:38.180]  and gave it a little more,
[03:08:38.180 --> 03:08:40.660]  like a little more earth in the bottom.
[03:08:40.660 --> 03:08:42.700]  And then Chadwick is, he's sharp, man.
[03:08:42.700 --> 03:08:44.660]  I met him online,
[03:08:44.660 --> 03:08:48.860]  but then we got to hang out at the breeders discussion
[03:08:48.860 --> 03:08:51.140]  because he was at the Regen Conference in Maine.
[03:08:51.140 --> 03:08:53.380]  So just a really smart, sharp dude,
[03:08:54.540 --> 03:08:57.100]  educated in botany,
[03:08:58.780 --> 03:09:01.100]  devoted breeder, pretty diverse,
[03:09:01.100 --> 03:09:02.860]  covers a lot of grounds,
[03:09:02.860 --> 03:09:04.540]  messes around with a lot of different shit,
[03:09:04.540 --> 03:09:08.060]  but organized, he's bright.
[03:09:08.060 --> 03:09:11.140]  So I'm curious to see what he pulled out.
[03:09:12.980 --> 03:09:14.940]  Can you explain, Kev,
[03:09:14.940 --> 03:09:17.940]  because my lack of experience in like,
[03:09:17.940 --> 03:09:21.500]  we were talking about the SFV, you just got back.
[03:09:21.500 --> 03:09:23.580]  And I can't say that I've had the SFV
[03:09:23.580 --> 03:09:25.900]  and I had a really killer cut of OG
[03:09:26.820 --> 03:09:29.980]  back in 2008, 2009-ish,
[03:09:29.980 --> 03:09:33.940]  but placing it in the flavor profile,
[03:09:34.140 --> 03:09:35.060]  curious.
[03:09:36.780 --> 03:09:37.620]  Where's it go?
[03:09:37.620 --> 03:09:40.140]  About the Larry compared to the SFV,
[03:09:40.140 --> 03:09:42.620]  like the SFVs, I'm hearing lemony,
[03:09:42.620 --> 03:09:45.260]  that Larry sounds more like the OG that I had.
[03:09:45.260 --> 03:09:49.140]  It was almost more soapy and gassy.
[03:09:50.060 --> 03:09:53.940]  The Larry's lemony too,
[03:09:53.940 --> 03:09:57.300]  just not as astringent.
[03:09:57.300 --> 03:10:01.540]  And the Larry's thicker and it comes in a little earlier,
[03:10:01.540 --> 03:10:04.500]  but I would say, depending on your,
[03:10:04.500 --> 03:10:06.660]  you know what, I collected all of them, right?
[03:10:06.660 --> 03:10:08.180]  And because the bottom line was,
[03:10:08.180 --> 03:10:10.860]  they all were really high quality.
[03:10:10.860 --> 03:10:13.340]  So I got the SFV from Mandel
[03:10:13.340 --> 03:10:16.140]  and I got the Topanga from Mandel,
[03:10:16.140 --> 03:10:19.340]  because in his opinion, those were the two bookends of OG.
[03:10:19.340 --> 03:10:22.900]  If you had those two, you had the two ends of it.
[03:10:22.900 --> 03:10:24.860]  And then what I did is I went looking for shit
[03:10:24.860 --> 03:10:26.060]  in the middle.
[03:10:26.060 --> 03:10:28.820]  So I started looking for the gas cuts,
[03:10:28.820 --> 03:10:30.860]  which were really the HA lines.
[03:10:30.860 --> 03:10:33.620]  So the Hell's Angels had their own lines of OG
[03:10:33.620 --> 03:10:35.580]  that they had sourced out of bag seed,
[03:10:35.580 --> 03:10:38.420]  you know, coming out of OG that they'd bought from somebody.
[03:10:38.420 --> 03:10:42.140]  Well, they found some very specific directions,
[03:10:42.140 --> 03:10:43.820]  which was the heavy gas.
[03:10:43.820 --> 03:10:46.060]  That's where like the blood diamond cut is.
[03:10:46.060 --> 03:10:47.820]  That's really an old HA cut.
[03:10:49.140 --> 03:10:52.700]  And at that time, they would provide you the material
[03:10:52.700 --> 03:10:56.300]  to grow and you'd have to kick them back 20% of the price.
[03:10:56.300 --> 03:10:58.620]  And so you had an arrangement with them
[03:10:58.620 --> 03:11:00.180]  to where you could grow the plant,
[03:11:00.180 --> 03:11:02.060]  but you really didn't own it.
[03:11:02.060 --> 03:11:03.780]  And if you fucked them, they'd come over your house
[03:11:03.780 --> 03:11:06.580]  and take the plant and some of your teeth.
[03:11:06.580 --> 03:11:10.540]  So it was like the gangster cuts,
[03:11:10.540 --> 03:11:12.980]  but that's where some of the differences came in
[03:11:12.980 --> 03:11:15.300]  because they had their own markets.
[03:11:15.300 --> 03:11:17.340]  And so you had these different markets appearing.
[03:11:17.340 --> 03:11:21.980]  In the Louis XIII, that was coming out of the Armenians.
[03:11:21.980 --> 03:11:26.460]  And so the Armenian crew had that down in Hollywood
[03:11:26.460 --> 03:11:28.700]  and it was priceless.
[03:11:28.740 --> 03:11:32.460]  So that one is different in the sense that it's got,
[03:11:32.460 --> 03:11:34.580]  it's almost like the TK compared to an OG
[03:11:34.580 --> 03:11:36.420]  where you have, you know it's related,
[03:11:36.420 --> 03:11:40.260]  but there's other complexities involved
[03:11:40.260 --> 03:11:44.940]  and very attractive, just that it wasn't in the release.
[03:11:44.940 --> 03:11:46.980]  So the public didn't get their hands on it
[03:11:46.980 --> 03:11:48.860]  to the same degree.
[03:11:48.860 --> 03:11:52.260]  But I like that the SFV cut that I just got back,
[03:11:52.260 --> 03:11:55.860]  that took 14th at the Emerald Cup out of like 1100.
[03:11:55.860 --> 03:11:59.140]  So it was the highest place in pure OG ever
[03:11:59.140 --> 03:12:00.780]  at the Emerald Cup.
[03:12:00.780 --> 03:12:04.100]  And I just got a Meristem version back
[03:12:04.100 --> 03:12:07.500]  from Sergio at Cultivated.
[03:12:07.500 --> 03:12:09.820]  And so Cultivated is a nursery out of Sacramento
[03:12:09.820 --> 03:12:12.580]  and they're using a laboratory to do all the scrub
[03:12:12.580 --> 03:12:14.740]  and then they propagate it conventionally,
[03:12:14.740 --> 03:12:16.820]  but they're doing a beautiful job.
[03:12:16.820 --> 03:12:19.500]  And so I got my old SFV back, but Meristem
[03:12:19.500 --> 03:12:21.620]  then it's stunning because the nodes stack on,
[03:12:21.620 --> 03:12:22.820]  it's radically different.
[03:12:22.820 --> 03:12:24.860]  It made me really realize,
[03:12:24.860 --> 03:12:26.580]  because I've had a lot of stuff scrubbed,
[03:12:26.580 --> 03:12:28.580]  but when I looked at that OG specifically,
[03:12:28.580 --> 03:12:30.660]  because I had it for so long and ran it so many times,
[03:12:30.660 --> 03:12:32.660]  I was like, fuck, I've never ran it
[03:12:32.660 --> 03:12:36.260]  because I realized that it's been pathogenically inhibited,
[03:12:36.260 --> 03:12:38.460]  fuck it for a long time.
[03:12:38.460 --> 03:12:40.580]  And so the stack on it's unreal,
[03:12:40.580 --> 03:12:43.100]  the nodal spacing is killer.
[03:12:43.100 --> 03:12:47.020]  And the Larry, I like the Larry as an outdoor cut.
[03:12:47.020 --> 03:12:49.020]  It produces stunningly inside,
[03:12:49.020 --> 03:12:50.460]  but outdoor it comes in almost like,
[03:12:50.460 --> 03:12:51.820]  say, you know, at least 10 days,
[03:12:51.820 --> 03:12:54.500]  seven to 10 days earlier than the SFV,
[03:12:55.140 --> 03:12:55.980]  comes in almost like, you know,
[03:12:55.980 --> 03:12:58.860]  two and a half, three weeks earlier than the Skywalker.
[03:13:00.220 --> 03:13:02.700]  The blood, it comes in probably seven days earlier
[03:13:02.700 --> 03:13:05.540]  than the blood, but the blood, that HA gas cut
[03:13:05.540 --> 03:13:09.140]  and the Larry are both that same heavy, thick, full bodied,
[03:13:09.140 --> 03:13:13.220]  like OG is usually not as robust.
[03:13:13.220 --> 03:13:15.700]  Those are robust outside in that way.
[03:13:15.700 --> 03:13:20.700]  And so the Larry's a gas with a lemon tone that's nice.
[03:13:21.700 --> 03:13:23.820]  SFV is more stringent,
[03:13:23.820 --> 03:13:26.300]  like you're taking a breath of air in a hospital.
[03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:32.240]  Ever touched the, or smoked the Obama?
[03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:34.880]  No.
[03:13:34.880 --> 03:13:35.840]  It was big in Portland for a minute.
[03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:37.200]  It was real big in Portland.
[03:13:37.200 --> 03:13:39.480]  And that's where I, they went to,
[03:13:39.480 --> 03:13:42.640]  that went the extreme direction of that soapy flavor.
[03:13:42.640 --> 03:13:43.480]  You know?
[03:13:43.480 --> 03:13:44.640]  Totally, totally.
[03:13:44.640 --> 03:13:49.640]  And what I noticed was the ghost, the HA cut and the SFV,
[03:13:50.080 --> 03:13:52.040]  that really gives me the spectrum
[03:13:52.040 --> 03:13:53.920]  of what people expect OG to be,
[03:13:53.920 --> 03:13:55.920]  depending on how they were exposed to it
[03:13:55.920 --> 03:13:57.160]  when they were younger.
[03:13:57.160 --> 03:14:00.240]  So if you were catching it from the gas crowd,
[03:14:00.240 --> 03:14:01.920]  you need the gas one.
[03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:04.840]  If it was the astringent, it's the SFV.
[03:14:06.200 --> 03:14:11.200]  If it's more that earthy, fuller complex, it's the ghost.
[03:14:11.280 --> 03:14:13.840]  Cause almost nobody got to smoke the TK.
[03:14:13.840 --> 03:14:15.880]  I mean, I know people that are in the game for years.
[03:14:15.880 --> 03:14:18.280]  And when I showed them the, when I showed them the,
[03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:20.200]  the Louis XIII, they were like,
[03:14:20.200 --> 03:14:21.720]  I thought that shit was a myth.
[03:14:21.720 --> 03:14:24.480]  And I said, no, I got his fucking mom right here.
[03:14:24.480 --> 03:14:26.720]  And then we seen the product and they're like, holy fuck.
[03:14:26.720 --> 03:14:28.920]  So they just hadn't had a chance to touch it and see it.
[03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:31.760]  The real Skywalker is the same way too.
[03:14:31.760 --> 03:14:35.040]  It was, it was so stretchy that a lot of people
[03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:36.360]  didn't like it for the indoor
[03:14:36.360 --> 03:14:38.280]  because they didn't have the ability to really,
[03:14:38.280 --> 03:14:39.320]  you know, control it.
[03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:43.280]  And the problem is when you don't have the skills
[03:14:43.280 --> 03:14:46.000]  or the ability to handle a variety,
[03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:47.680]  you just fucking offload it
[03:14:47.680 --> 03:14:49.240]  and look for something different.
[03:14:49.240 --> 03:14:52.600]  And it, it takes away from the public
[03:14:52.600 --> 03:14:54.400]  being able to be exposed to it.
[03:14:56.440 --> 03:14:57.800]  Cause the sky fits in there too.
[03:14:57.800 --> 03:15:02.280]  The sky has more of a, it's a theory type high,
[03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:06.120]  like the highest pulsing, different in that form.
[03:15:07.960 --> 03:15:12.960]  So the winner of that one was B-par with 375 B-E-E space P-A-R
[03:15:13.960 --> 03:15:16.280]  That was for the Matterhorn?
[03:15:16.280 --> 03:15:17.120]  Yeah.
[03:15:17.120 --> 03:15:17.960]  Okay.
[03:15:24.390 --> 03:15:31.240]  And let me go to where you can go,
[03:15:33.440 --> 03:15:36.400]  PayPal.me, Delano Silver.
[03:15:39.380 --> 03:15:42.700]  And if you just won those last two bids,
[03:15:42.700 --> 03:15:47.100]  those last two auctions for the coffee cubed
[03:15:47.180 --> 03:15:51.940]  or for the Matterhorn, you can hit up,
[03:15:54.740 --> 03:15:55.780]  probably cause I'm not sure.
[03:15:55.780 --> 03:15:57.420]  Kai has a handful of accounts.
[03:15:57.420 --> 03:16:00.140]  It might be simpler to hit up me, Dutch Blooms.
[03:16:00.140 --> 03:16:04.140]  And yeah, send me the fucking picture
[03:16:04.140 --> 03:16:05.900]  cause he's got a number of backup accounts
[03:16:05.900 --> 03:16:08.780]  and it's sometimes hard for me to figure it out.
[03:16:08.780 --> 03:16:11.940]  So hit me up Dutch Blooms with a screenshot
[03:16:11.940 --> 03:16:15.100]  of your donation to Delano's PayPal
[03:16:15.100 --> 03:16:16.940]  and a message of what seeds they were
[03:16:17.780 --> 03:16:20.740]  and how much you paid and then your address.
[03:16:20.740 --> 03:16:22.660]  And then I can take that and screenshot that
[03:16:22.660 --> 03:16:26.500]  and send that to Kai or whoever else that we did it with.
[03:16:27.740 --> 03:16:28.580]  All right.
[03:16:28.580 --> 03:16:30.340]  And up next we have,
[03:16:36.140 --> 03:16:37.660]  so you guys want to talk about that?
[03:16:37.660 --> 03:16:40.060]  Kevin, you want to keep going on that?
[03:16:40.060 --> 03:16:45.060]  Yeah, he might've been able to get for me a direct LL13.
[03:16:47.020 --> 03:16:48.620]  He would have listed in the naming
[03:16:48.620 --> 03:16:50.140]  that it was into that Afghani.
[03:16:50.140 --> 03:16:53.580]  So I might've just kicked him a straight Louis XIII
[03:16:53.580 --> 03:16:56.740]  in addition to that Afghani line seed.
[03:16:56.740 --> 03:16:59.540]  But the main point is the Louis is a fucking nasty,
[03:16:59.540 --> 03:17:03.100]  rare, potent, numbers are hot,
[03:17:03.100 --> 03:17:07.820]  comes in 28 plus, 29 for the original,
[03:17:07.820 --> 03:17:09.660]  those are old series OGs.
[03:17:11.900 --> 03:17:15.660]  The story on the cut was that I helped out this old lady
[03:17:15.660 --> 03:17:17.180]  and she's just a nice old chick.
[03:17:17.180 --> 03:17:20.140]  And I gave her a hand with something one time,
[03:17:20.140 --> 03:17:20.980]  just helped her out.
[03:17:20.980 --> 03:17:23.020]  She was having a bad time in life.
[03:17:23.020 --> 03:17:27.540]  And her daughter who lived down in LA,
[03:17:29.500 --> 03:17:34.500]  her husband was the guy that had owned the cut at this club.
[03:17:35.700 --> 03:17:38.780]  And they brought me these clones as a thank you
[03:17:38.780 --> 03:17:41.220]  and said, here, these clones will make you rich.
[03:17:41.220 --> 03:17:43.580]  And it was such a beautiful gesture, you know?
[03:17:43.580 --> 03:17:45.460]  And then down the road,
[03:17:45.460 --> 03:17:47.500]  I meet this other cat named Damien
[03:17:48.420 --> 03:17:50.860]  that is really, I think, the breeder of it,
[03:17:50.860 --> 03:17:52.980]  the one who really did the work on Louis
[03:17:52.980 --> 03:17:55.820]  and then he released it into that group.
[03:17:55.820 --> 03:18:00.820]  And so it's just savage Ash OG that other people don't have.
[03:18:03.300 --> 03:18:05.980]  And I wouldn't say rarer than the TK
[03:18:05.980 --> 03:18:08.060]  because you see the TK all over the place,
[03:18:08.060 --> 03:18:10.900]  but you do not see the Louis all over the place.
[03:18:10.900 --> 03:18:15.620]  And it's just some beautiful, full, rich, complex OG smoke.
[03:18:15.620 --> 03:18:18.900]  And it grows well, the plant has a solid body.
[03:18:18.900 --> 03:18:19.980]  Man, I loved it.
[03:18:19.980 --> 03:18:21.780]  You know, it's just like, you hold so much shit.
[03:18:21.780 --> 03:18:24.220]  So like I spread plants out continuously.
[03:18:24.220 --> 03:18:25.700]  So I got partners that are running it
[03:18:25.700 --> 03:18:27.220]  and I get to go see it and smoke it
[03:18:27.220 --> 03:18:29.500]  and I can get cut back if I need it.
[03:18:29.500 --> 03:18:31.940]  But man, it was a nasty one.
[03:18:31.940 --> 03:18:33.420]  She is gorgeous.
[03:18:33.420 --> 03:18:35.380]  And then the old New York Sawa,
[03:18:35.380 --> 03:18:38.300]  which would be a great combo because that's an OG Sawa.
[03:18:38.300 --> 03:18:39.380]  That's his OG Sawa,
[03:18:39.380 --> 03:18:42.220]  kind of like, you know, Ganja Rebel's OG Sawa.
[03:18:42.220 --> 03:18:44.780]  But Rebel was using the nastiest Sawa
[03:18:44.780 --> 03:18:46.260]  that he could find on the East Coast
[03:18:46.260 --> 03:18:49.140]  and the nastiest OG, OG chems and stuff
[03:18:49.140 --> 03:18:53.140]  that he was using from Humboldt County.
[03:18:53.140 --> 03:18:55.460]  So just quickly, Chadwick clarified,
[03:18:55.460 --> 03:18:57.620]  it's the Afghan cross.
[03:18:57.620 --> 03:18:58.460]  Is the Afghan cross.
[03:18:58.460 --> 03:19:02.380]  He said he took cab season cross to an NYC male.
[03:19:04.300 --> 03:19:05.620]  Yeah, we talked about that one earlier
[03:19:05.620 --> 03:19:08.420]  where it's the same cut, but into that land race Afghani
[03:19:08.420 --> 03:19:12.460]  that my partner's son brought back from the war
[03:19:12.460 --> 03:19:14.140]  when he was over there doing that shit.
[03:19:14.140 --> 03:19:17.660]  But his dad was an old school killer grower
[03:19:17.660 --> 03:19:19.420]  and the kid had his shit together
[03:19:19.420 --> 03:19:21.660]  and the kid brought back some really nice stock.
[03:19:21.660 --> 03:19:24.220]  The old man came over the spot one time
[03:19:24.220 --> 03:19:25.460]  with a car full of plants,
[03:19:25.460 --> 03:19:27.260]  whole fucking car was filled with plants.
[03:19:27.260 --> 03:19:30.300]  And he was like, I think I might be catching a case.
[03:19:30.300 --> 03:19:33.500]  He says, so I want to drop all these off with you real quick
[03:19:33.500 --> 03:19:36.860]  so if they raid my house, we don't lose the stock.
[03:19:38.460 --> 03:19:40.860]  So what do we start this one off at?
[03:19:40.860 --> 03:19:42.900]  Look, I don't even know what Chadwick lists them at,
[03:19:42.900 --> 03:19:44.940]  but I know that you can't get your hands
[03:19:44.940 --> 03:19:46.420]  on that first end of it.
[03:19:46.420 --> 03:19:49.620]  So I'd say we'll at least start them off at like, you know,
[03:19:49.620 --> 03:19:50.940]  250.
[03:19:50.940 --> 03:19:51.780]  Yeah.
[03:19:52.620 --> 03:19:53.620]  Yeah.
[03:19:53.620 --> 03:19:55.740]  He's really cheap, honestly.
[03:19:55.740 --> 03:19:56.580]  Yeah, he-
[03:19:56.580 --> 03:19:58.420]  Yeah, I don't know, I don't know what the movement is.
[03:19:58.420 --> 03:20:01.100]  Cheap isn't the right word, but he lists his stuff low,
[03:20:01.100 --> 03:20:03.700]  but I think 250 is definitely-
[03:20:03.700 --> 03:20:05.300]  I think he approves of that.
[03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:10.430]  Now, Chadwick, you did say you were going to bed,
[03:20:10.430 --> 03:20:11.870]  but you're still on the chat.
[03:20:13.270 --> 03:20:15.470]  Well, shit, he's got his kids up on the board, you know?
[03:20:15.470 --> 03:20:17.310]  Like, you know, you don't go to the,
[03:20:17.310 --> 03:20:19.710]  you don't take a piss when your kid's on the fucking ice rink.
[03:20:19.710 --> 03:20:21.990]  You're like, wait a minute, I'll watch him play.
[03:20:23.670 --> 03:20:25.670]  And you should probably, you should follow his feed.
[03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:26.950]  He does some cool shit.
[03:20:26.950 --> 03:20:30.710]  He gifted me a bunch of his stuff,
[03:20:30.710 --> 03:20:32.390]  the Belvia that he's been working,
[03:20:32.390 --> 03:20:35.790]  and then the skunk he got from you,
[03:20:36.270 --> 03:20:37.750]  the 88 skunk, I think.
[03:20:37.750 --> 03:20:38.590]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:20:39.470 --> 03:20:43.750]  He crossed that into the Nadia DaVie that was,
[03:20:43.750 --> 03:20:45.190]  you know, I ran to.
[03:20:45.190 --> 03:20:47.430]  And I actually couldn't run them any further
[03:20:47.430 --> 03:20:49.390]  because they were so wild.
[03:20:49.390 --> 03:20:51.990]  And that's why I wanted to look at them, but I needed-
[03:20:52.870 --> 03:20:54.750]  The Nandavi, it's open,
[03:20:54.750 --> 03:20:57.230]  because that 88, that 88 is a killer skunk.
[03:20:57.230 --> 03:20:59.310]  I got that out of Spain.
[03:20:59.310 --> 03:21:01.630]  It was very, the flavors that I did find
[03:21:02.590 --> 03:21:06.310]  were fruity almost, like a bubble gummy.
[03:21:06.310 --> 03:21:07.550]  I mean, not straight bubble gummy,
[03:21:07.550 --> 03:21:10.310]  but leaning towards that, you know?
[03:21:10.310 --> 03:21:12.270]  Yeah, it was used as a breeder.
[03:21:12.270 --> 03:21:14.870]  It was used as the pollen recipient
[03:21:14.870 --> 03:21:17.670]  in a bunch of Spanish projects.
[03:21:17.670 --> 03:21:19.590]  And it had been held over there for a long time.
[03:21:19.590 --> 03:21:21.190]  I got an 81 from here.
[03:21:21.190 --> 03:21:24.510]  They'd been held all these years up in Salmon Creek.
[03:21:24.510 --> 03:21:27.230]  And then the guy that held it passed away.
[03:21:27.230 --> 03:21:31.190]  And his librarian, you know, plant custodian,
[03:21:31.750 --> 03:21:32.590]  hit me up and said,
[03:21:32.590 --> 03:21:33.430]  hey, I'm having problems.
[03:21:33.430 --> 03:21:34.550]  I think I might start losing some of this stock.
[03:21:34.550 --> 03:21:36.550]  I just don't have the skills.
[03:21:36.550 --> 03:21:39.870]  And so they said, could you hold on to this 81
[03:21:39.870 --> 03:21:43.070]  because it's fucking ancient.
[03:21:43.070 --> 03:21:47.790]  And same thing, it had like a burnt rubber sneaker
[03:21:47.790 --> 03:21:51.550]  with a complex fruit aroma
[03:21:51.550 --> 03:21:54.150]  that just filled the room just from a stem rub.
[03:21:55.550 --> 03:21:56.390]  So it had this-
[03:21:56.390 --> 03:21:59.870]  When the mom room heated up at all,
[03:21:59.870 --> 03:22:02.590]  if you warmed up the room or you took any cuts, man,
[03:22:02.590 --> 03:22:04.710]  that fucking whole building stunk,
[03:22:04.710 --> 03:22:08.070]  but not of skunk urine, you know?
[03:22:08.070 --> 03:22:10.470]  Really beautiful, beautiful direction.
[03:22:12.150 --> 03:22:13.550]  That's why I like skunks in general
[03:22:13.550 --> 03:22:18.110]  because we call it a smell, but it's a family.
[03:22:18.110 --> 03:22:21.510]  And in it, there was all these different directions
[03:22:21.510 --> 03:22:23.070]  that people would choose.
[03:22:23.070 --> 03:22:24.670]  And I know which ones I like best,
[03:22:24.670 --> 03:22:27.670]  but a lot of them were just musky and full and rich.
[03:22:27.710 --> 03:22:31.870]  And the high was clear and just a good quality pot.
[03:22:35.700 --> 03:22:38.020]  I love the skunk because in Kentucky,
[03:22:38.020 --> 03:22:40.820]  that was in the fall when everything,
[03:22:40.820 --> 03:22:44.100]  I mean, even early nineties when I was young
[03:22:44.100 --> 03:22:47.020]  and those smells coming off my father and uncles
[03:22:47.020 --> 03:22:49.740]  and things of that nature in the fall.
[03:22:49.740 --> 03:22:53.060]  But the closest thing you could pair that up to
[03:22:53.060 --> 03:22:57.540]  as a child was a skunk, like that type of smell.
[03:22:57.540 --> 03:23:02.540]  And even today driving down the road in Michigan,
[03:23:02.820 --> 03:23:04.300]  it wouldn't, two weeks ago,
[03:23:04.300 --> 03:23:06.020]  there was a dead skunk on the side of the road.
[03:23:06.020 --> 03:23:07.740]  And I looked at Shannon, I was like, I love that smell.
[03:23:07.740 --> 03:23:09.540]  And she was like, oh, what are you talking about?
[03:23:09.540 --> 03:23:13.740]  I'm like, it's just any grower, any smoker,
[03:23:13.740 --> 03:23:16.700]  it just identifies to a certain time
[03:23:16.700 --> 03:23:21.700]  and a certain place and a certain memory of marijuana.
[03:23:22.380 --> 03:23:26.020]  And it's still a pleasurable thing.
[03:23:26.380 --> 03:23:31.380]  So I enjoy that skunk memory, but it's been hard to find.
[03:23:33.020 --> 03:23:35.660]  I mean, out of everything I've popped
[03:23:35.660 --> 03:23:37.980]  and out of Emerald Mountains, Roswell, Malawi,
[03:23:37.980 --> 03:23:40.180]  which was Malawi and rural Cush.
[03:23:40.180 --> 03:23:42.700]  I thought I had it until I cured it,
[03:23:42.700 --> 03:23:45.220]  like on the plant until it went in the jar,
[03:23:45.220 --> 03:23:47.060]  two separate things, but I thought I had it
[03:23:47.060 --> 03:23:48.420]  until it went in the cure.
[03:23:48.420 --> 03:23:50.500]  And yeah, I lost it in the cure.
[03:23:50.500 --> 03:23:52.780]  It went more into that Duke diamond
[03:23:52.780 --> 03:23:56.860]  kind of a burnt rubber, pine tree, burnt rubber,
[03:23:56.860 --> 03:23:59.580]  which is massively enjoyable,
[03:23:59.580 --> 03:24:02.140]  but I thought I had that skunk there for a moment.
[03:24:02.140 --> 03:24:07.140]  So that's the end of me rambling.
[03:24:07.820 --> 03:24:09.540]  I got about three grams of RSO
[03:24:09.540 --> 03:24:11.300]  and about four drinks in me at this point.
[03:24:11.300 --> 03:24:13.140]  And I haven't had a cigarette in forever.
[03:24:13.140 --> 03:24:15.700]  I'd fight a fucking bear right now for a cigarette,
[03:24:15.700 --> 03:24:17.380]  but that's a whole nother story.
[03:24:17.380 --> 03:24:18.500]  So.
[03:24:18.500 --> 03:24:20.860]  You guys got skunk cabbage in Kentucky?
[03:24:21.820 --> 03:24:24.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:24:24.260 --> 03:24:25.420]  New England, like where I'm from,
[03:24:25.420 --> 03:24:29.020]  we had all the bogs, you know, and skunk cabbage
[03:24:29.020 --> 03:24:32.100]  and the stench coming out of that, it's the same thing.
[03:24:32.100 --> 03:24:37.100]  It's just really, once you get on the earth,
[03:24:37.140 --> 03:24:39.020]  it's like you start to enjoy it.
[03:24:39.020 --> 03:24:41.460]  You get some of that smells out of sauerkraut.
[03:24:41.460 --> 03:24:43.460]  I know that might sound silly,
[03:24:43.460 --> 03:24:48.060]  but like you get a skunk smell out of fermenting sauerkraut
[03:24:48.100 --> 03:24:49.260]  and-
[03:24:49.260 --> 03:24:51.260]  Yeah, it depends who fermented it.
[03:24:51.260 --> 03:24:52.100]  Yeah.
[03:24:52.100 --> 03:24:53.980]  It depends what you broke it down.
[03:24:53.980 --> 03:24:56.380]  And I'm used to that from all that mash
[03:24:56.380 --> 03:24:57.740]  from all the Burton distilleries.
[03:24:57.740 --> 03:25:01.620]  Like my farm in Kentucky is 3.2 miles from Four Roses,
[03:25:02.900 --> 03:25:07.900]  seven miles from Buffalo Trace,
[03:25:09.700 --> 03:25:11.860]  Willet is 30 miles away,
[03:25:12.940 --> 03:25:16.020]  Wild Turkey's like, I don't know, 11 miles away.
[03:25:16.020 --> 03:25:17.780]  So you can smell that mash,
[03:25:18.500 --> 03:25:19.620]  especially on hot days in the summer,
[03:25:19.620 --> 03:25:22.380]  you can smell that shit 10, 12 miles away,
[03:25:22.380 --> 03:25:24.900]  especially the closer you get.
[03:25:24.900 --> 03:25:29.900]  And it brings on a skunky cabbage fermented smell
[03:25:30.340 --> 03:25:35.340]  that I'm finding in a lot of Jackson's males.
[03:25:35.540 --> 03:25:38.380]  Like in some of the plants, even on veg,
[03:25:38.380 --> 03:25:40.860]  you get this skunky cabbage, cucumber,
[03:25:40.860 --> 03:25:43.220]  dill pickle smell kind of mixture.
[03:25:44.340 --> 03:25:45.940]  That's what that reminds me of.
[03:25:45.940 --> 03:25:49.500]  Summer's driving past the distilleries,
[03:25:49.500 --> 03:25:53.020]  that mash for many, if that makes any sense, my rambling.
[03:25:53.020 --> 03:25:58.020]  But there is definitely a dill cabbage-y smell
[03:25:58.460 --> 03:26:00.540]  to the males that I like to select
[03:26:01.580 --> 03:26:04.260]  that end up giving me more of a gas flavor
[03:26:04.260 --> 03:26:08.020]  when it goes to the female as far as flower goes.
[03:26:11.470 --> 03:26:12.310]  Totally.
[03:26:15.770 --> 03:26:17.530]  You said something the other day, Josh,
[03:26:17.530 --> 03:26:18.970]  about the males you were going through
[03:26:18.970 --> 03:26:23.290]  about the dill pickle smell or something along those lines.
[03:26:24.570 --> 03:26:25.570]  Yeah, that's gene too.
[03:26:25.570 --> 03:26:28.570]  That's what gene's using as an indicator of gas.
[03:26:29.690 --> 03:26:32.970]  If he smells that dill pickle odor in the stem rub,
[03:26:32.970 --> 03:26:35.650]  he gets a pretty good idea that it's gonna transfer.
[03:26:35.650 --> 03:26:38.290]  Did you ever utilize any of the waste products
[03:26:38.290 --> 03:26:42.650]  from the distilleries in composting for your own purposes?
[03:26:42.650 --> 03:26:45.010]  Like, is that something that in your area
[03:26:45.010 --> 03:26:47.290]  that you had a farm in prior
[03:26:47.290 --> 03:26:52.250]  that you'd been able to utilize some of that spent grains?
[03:26:52.250 --> 03:26:54.370]  Can you break that down?
[03:26:54.370 --> 03:26:55.210]  I didn't.
[03:26:55.210 --> 03:26:57.570]  I mean, honestly, I was a synthetic grower
[03:26:57.570 --> 03:27:01.130]  until Duke Diamond pushed me into organics
[03:27:01.130 --> 03:27:02.450]  a couple years ago.
[03:27:02.450 --> 03:27:06.770]  And originally with my parasitic and bacterial infections
[03:27:06.770 --> 03:27:09.410]  in this port stuff, the doctors wouldn't let me run
[03:27:09.410 --> 03:27:12.250]  any teas, any organics, anything,
[03:27:12.250 --> 03:27:14.210]  even when I moved to Michigan growing,
[03:27:14.690 --> 03:27:16.850]  which was stupid in hindsight.
[03:27:16.850 --> 03:27:18.370]  Me planting microbes, I think,
[03:27:18.370 --> 03:27:22.170]  has helped me as much with my conditions as anything else.
[03:27:22.170 --> 03:27:26.810]  But back in the day, we did a modified hemoculture.
[03:27:26.810 --> 03:27:29.690]  I still do it to this day as far as dig down
[03:27:29.690 --> 03:27:32.090]  and lay all the wood in these pits
[03:27:32.090 --> 03:27:35.090]  that just trapped water for the plants
[03:27:35.090 --> 03:27:37.010]  where we couldn't go back to them.
[03:27:37.010 --> 03:27:42.010]  But doing any organics with the mash and the spent grains,
[03:27:42.450 --> 03:27:44.090]  I didn't do at that time.
[03:27:44.850 --> 03:27:45.850]  And I wished I had.
[03:27:46.850 --> 03:27:50.210]  Now, I recently got 13 gallons of mash out of,
[03:27:50.210 --> 03:27:53.210]  I shouldn't name the distillery
[03:27:53.210 --> 03:27:55.170]  because that'd probably get them in trouble,
[03:27:55.170 --> 03:27:57.370]  out of Kentucky to run my RSO,
[03:27:57.370 --> 03:28:00.290]  which was out of non-GMO corn.
[03:28:00.290 --> 03:28:01.890]  I just got it this week.
[03:28:01.890 --> 03:28:03.930]  So I'm excited to run that.
[03:28:03.930 --> 03:28:05.330]  It's more of raw.
[03:28:09.970 --> 03:28:12.010]  The Everclear, whatever you want to call it,
[03:28:12.010 --> 03:28:13.970]  the mash starting off,
[03:28:14.810 --> 03:28:15.650]  it was all rye based.
[03:28:15.650 --> 03:28:18.930]  So I've never ran RSO in pure rye form.
[03:28:18.930 --> 03:28:21.010]  So I'm looking forward to doing that this week.
[03:28:21.010 --> 03:28:23.850]  But I still have access to all that mash
[03:28:23.850 --> 03:28:25.650]  and I could probably ship you a bunch.
[03:28:25.650 --> 03:28:26.970]  I've got a barrel head sitting here.
[03:28:26.970 --> 03:28:28.610]  I'm still meaning to ship you.
[03:28:30.010 --> 03:28:31.690]  I would like to ferment some of it.
[03:28:31.690 --> 03:28:34.730]  Now, I have a bunch of questions for Clackamas Coop, really,
[03:28:34.730 --> 03:28:37.690]  on some of that fermenting grain coming out of the mash.
[03:28:37.690 --> 03:28:41.370]  Now, I know that my grain got used a lot of it
[03:28:41.370 --> 03:28:42.970]  for the cattle because they,
[03:28:42.970 --> 03:28:44.930]  Fort Rose was just three miles away
[03:28:44.930 --> 03:28:47.770]  and they would ship the fermented grains
[03:28:47.770 --> 03:28:50.410]  right out to the cattle and to the pigs when I was little,
[03:28:50.410 --> 03:28:52.810]  like eight, nine years old, maybe eight, 89.
[03:28:54.850 --> 03:28:58.210]  But I didn't ever get to compost it that way.
[03:28:59.210 --> 03:29:01.850]  It's really stupid that I haven't done a side-by-side
[03:29:02.810 --> 03:29:06.610]  because back, not back, it was too far long ago,
[03:29:06.610 --> 03:29:11.170]  but about 2014, I was running indoors beds
[03:29:11.170 --> 03:29:14.250]  and I was running Clackamas Coop's program,
[03:29:14.250 --> 03:29:16.890]  for the most part, except for the name.
[03:29:16.890 --> 03:29:20.490]  And in terms of, I was doing the sprouted teas,
[03:29:20.490 --> 03:29:25.490]  the aloe vera and the coconut and the malted barley.
[03:29:25.930 --> 03:29:29.410]  And so what he does is it's malted barley.
[03:29:29.410 --> 03:29:31.170]  It's not spent grains.
[03:29:31.170 --> 03:29:33.090]  Spent grains are post-fermentation,
[03:29:33.090 --> 03:29:37.010]  not post-fermentation, but post-extracting
[03:29:37.010 --> 03:29:38.490]  the enzymes and the sugars.
[03:29:38.530 --> 03:29:41.930]  And I'm a brewer, so I should actually have done
[03:29:41.930 --> 03:29:44.210]  the side-by-side, but I haven't.
[03:29:44.210 --> 03:29:47.410]  But since I moved onto this property,
[03:29:47.410 --> 03:29:51.050]  I kind of stepped away from a lot of those finer practices
[03:29:51.050 --> 03:29:53.130]  because I've been doing a bunch of work.
[03:29:53.130 --> 03:29:54.970]  And I've been telling both, yeah,
[03:29:54.970 --> 03:29:57.130]  both I've been telling both Kevin and Nick,
[03:29:57.130 --> 03:29:59.370]  this is my first year in probably like four or five years.
[03:29:59.370 --> 03:30:00.610]  I've been like, oh shit,
[03:30:00.610 --> 03:30:03.050]  I'm kind of getting back to this stuff.
[03:30:03.050 --> 03:30:04.650]  And we were talking about my next round
[03:30:04.650 --> 03:30:07.970]  where I'm dumping the cherry pie limes in there.
[03:30:08.490 --> 03:30:11.010]  And I got a bunch of the other stuff going in there,
[03:30:11.010 --> 03:30:12.570]  some special clones.
[03:30:12.570 --> 03:30:15.090]  And I was talking on the phone with Coot
[03:30:15.090 --> 03:30:18.890]  and I was dumping, I called him to get a ratio
[03:30:18.890 --> 03:30:23.530]  on dumping DME and DME is dextrose malt extract.
[03:30:23.530 --> 03:30:26.050]  And it's a simple way to make beer.
[03:30:26.050 --> 03:30:27.530]  You could just dump this powder.
[03:30:27.530 --> 03:30:32.130]  It's the extract powder and you boil it up and add yeast.
[03:30:33.570 --> 03:30:35.730]  And there you go, you're making fucking beer.
[03:30:35.730 --> 03:30:37.690]  And so I just kind of jumped the gun.
[03:30:38.410 --> 03:30:39.610]  And I remember doing this back in the day
[03:30:39.610 --> 03:30:41.090]  and not really measuring the results,
[03:30:41.090 --> 03:30:42.410]  but I called him to kind of like
[03:30:42.410 --> 03:30:43.850]  get a little more serious about it.
[03:30:43.850 --> 03:30:46.250]  And he's like, well, let's see what happens.
[03:30:46.250 --> 03:30:47.090]  And so I did it.
[03:30:47.090 --> 03:30:49.050]  And I saw a little bit of fungal boost,
[03:30:49.050 --> 03:30:50.530]  but not like what I had seen
[03:30:50.530 --> 03:30:54.850]  from putting the malted grains on there.
[03:30:54.850 --> 03:30:56.890]  So I went back to the store and I was like,
[03:30:56.890 --> 03:30:59.050]  yo bro, you're cooking up with four bags, dude.
[03:30:59.050 --> 03:31:00.370]  He's like, are you crazy?
[03:31:00.370 --> 03:31:02.610]  I'm like, he's like, it's gonna be like 400, 500 bucks.
[03:31:02.610 --> 03:31:05.250]  I'm like, bro, give me four bags, we're good.
[03:31:05.770 --> 03:31:08.130]  And so I just got to go pick them up.
[03:31:08.130 --> 03:31:12.090]  They're here and I'm gonna dump those on my greenhouse.
[03:31:12.090 --> 03:31:14.010]  And I'm pretty excited about it, to be honest.
[03:31:14.010 --> 03:31:16.410]  I'm gonna dump a bunch of clay and stuff like that.
[03:31:16.410 --> 03:31:19.370]  And I think that this next run is gonna be like
[03:31:19.370 --> 03:31:21.570]  super, super out there.
[03:31:24.450 --> 03:31:27.330]  But so that kind of time back into the spent grains,
[03:31:27.330 --> 03:31:29.730]  I think that it changes for sure
[03:31:29.730 --> 03:31:33.370]  when you extract those sugars from the grains.
[03:31:33.370 --> 03:31:35.770]  And I can't say what the difference is gonna be
[03:31:36.810 --> 03:31:40.250]  in the way the microbes will put that into a plant post.
[03:31:41.410 --> 03:31:43.410]  I should have thought of that.
[03:31:45.610 --> 03:31:47.690]  A lot of that's in the enzymes
[03:31:47.690 --> 03:31:50.970]  that are still in the seed before fermentation
[03:31:50.970 --> 03:31:52.610]  that you're gonna be putting in the soil
[03:31:52.610 --> 03:31:55.810]  as opposed to the post fermentation or the extract.
[03:31:55.810 --> 03:31:57.490]  Right, and those guys, the beer guys
[03:31:57.490 --> 03:31:58.650]  are only about amylase.
[03:31:58.650 --> 03:32:00.010]  That's all that like, you look at it,
[03:32:00.010 --> 03:32:01.450]  you tell them that there's amylase,
[03:32:01.490 --> 03:32:03.570]  you don't give a fuck about anything else.
[03:32:05.450 --> 03:32:09.610]  We're about the unknown, sort of say, I am amylase.
[03:32:10.650 --> 03:32:12.370]  Look how dark that is there over there, Cav,
[03:32:12.370 --> 03:32:14.450]  and look how light it is here.
[03:32:14.450 --> 03:32:15.970]  I'm outside yet, because we go inside
[03:32:15.970 --> 03:32:17.050]  and you're gonna hit a baby.
[03:32:17.050 --> 03:32:19.810]  All you see is the weight of the beard and your teeth.
[03:32:20.690 --> 03:32:22.090]  Thank God.
[03:32:22.090 --> 03:32:25.010]  All right, so just quickly, did we have a winner?
[03:32:25.010 --> 03:32:28.810]  I'm totally spacing on Chadwick's seeds.
[03:32:29.810 --> 03:32:32.170]  And who is that?
[03:32:42.080 --> 03:32:50.970]  Who was the, anyone?
[03:32:52.170 --> 03:32:53.650]  Cascadian.
[03:32:53.650 --> 03:32:55.970]  I believe it was G-Unit with 300.
[03:32:56.890 --> 03:32:58.730]  I'm looking at the garden of Oxford.
[03:33:00.690 --> 03:33:03.050]  All right, sweet, I think we have one final.
[03:33:03.050 --> 03:33:07.930]  Yeah, and so we got someone on with us
[03:33:07.930 --> 03:33:12.050]  and that is Armchair Warrior, welcome.
[03:33:13.730 --> 03:33:15.690]  Are you in Canada?
[03:33:15.690 --> 03:33:16.530]  Yeah, I am.
[03:33:17.930 --> 03:33:20.050]  Vancouver, all right.
[03:33:22.410 --> 03:33:26.770]  And so you wanna tell us about what you're gonna donate?
[03:33:26.770 --> 03:33:29.570]  I have some blue cheese, purple kush,
[03:33:29.570 --> 03:33:33.970]  and I mixed those with Durban poison and Hindu kush.
[03:33:34.970 --> 03:33:38.410]  They're F1s after those two combined.
[03:33:40.970 --> 03:33:42.330]  And they're pretty awesome.
[03:33:43.730 --> 03:33:46.170]  Is that where you're smoking right now?
[03:33:46.170 --> 03:33:48.930]  No, this is a blend of some dispensary weed,
[03:33:48.930 --> 03:33:51.730]  because I'm plant rich and I'm weed poor.
[03:33:53.650 --> 03:33:54.490]  Right now we're doing.
[03:33:54.490 --> 03:33:56.290]  You want a 10 pack?
[03:33:56.290 --> 03:33:57.610]  No, I can do 20.
[03:33:57.610 --> 03:33:58.450]  20?
[03:33:59.330 --> 03:34:02.090]  All right, and what do you wanna start the bidding at?
[03:34:03.090 --> 03:34:05.170]  It doesn't matter, it's a charity.
[03:34:05.170 --> 03:34:06.050]  I'm giving them away
[03:34:06.050 --> 03:34:09.250]  and I just wanna make some money for this fella.
[03:34:09.250 --> 03:34:10.810]  That's nice, man, thank you.
[03:34:10.810 --> 03:34:12.850]  And say it again, can you go over what it was again?
[03:34:12.850 --> 03:34:14.610]  It was a.
[03:34:14.610 --> 03:34:18.850]  I purchased from a dispensary blue cheese, purple kush.
[03:34:18.850 --> 03:34:21.210]  And I had Durban poison and Hindu kush
[03:34:21.210 --> 03:34:23.410]  from back in the day that I mixed together.
[03:34:23.410 --> 03:34:25.290]  And then I put those together
[03:34:25.290 --> 03:34:28.810]  and now you have F1s of those two crosses.
[03:34:28.810 --> 03:34:29.650]  Totally, totally.
[03:34:29.970 --> 03:34:34.210]  That Durban Hindu must have been pretty cool.
[03:34:34.210 --> 03:34:36.690]  Yes, yes, it was very awesome.
[03:34:36.690 --> 03:34:41.530]  And I actually have some of the Hell's Angels 2010 cut
[03:34:41.530 --> 03:34:44.690]  that I saved by mixing it with Jamaican sugar.
[03:34:44.690 --> 03:34:46.930]  And I don't really know what Jamaican sugar is,
[03:34:46.930 --> 03:34:49.370]  but it was so sweet and the best strain
[03:34:49.370 --> 03:34:50.890]  that all my friends loved.
[03:34:50.890 --> 03:34:53.450]  And those are now 10 years old
[03:34:53.450 --> 03:34:55.250]  and they're down to 5% germ rate.
[03:34:55.250 --> 03:34:57.890]  So I don't really know what to do with them.
[03:34:57.890 --> 03:34:58.930]  I don't wanna use them,
[03:34:58.930 --> 03:35:02.770]  but I'd like to have them move on in the industry.
[03:35:02.770 --> 03:35:04.890]  So I'm willing to give those up as well.
[03:35:08.680 --> 03:35:10.640]  All right, so we're starting.
[03:35:10.640 --> 03:35:12.640]  All right, so what are we starting with?
[03:35:13.640 --> 03:35:16.280]  And by the way, do you have an Instagram handle?
[03:35:18.200 --> 03:35:19.320]  Not at the moment.
[03:35:19.320 --> 03:35:20.160]  Okay, that's fine.
[03:35:20.160 --> 03:35:21.960]  I was just gonna mock something up
[03:35:21.960 --> 03:35:23.600]  so we could say who's giving it away,
[03:35:23.600 --> 03:35:25.840]  but we'll stick with Armchair Warrior.
[03:35:26.840 --> 03:35:31.320]  So this is the blue cheese and purple kush, right?
[03:35:31.320 --> 03:35:32.160]  Yes.
[03:35:32.160 --> 03:35:35.120]  I'm sorry, cross with Durban poison and-
[03:35:35.120 --> 03:35:35.960]  Hindu.
[03:35:35.960 --> 03:35:36.800]  Okay.
[03:35:37.800 --> 03:35:41.160]  Kev, what do you wanna start this one off at?
[03:35:41.160 --> 03:35:42.000]  Oh shit, man.
[03:35:43.320 --> 03:35:44.160]  150.
[03:35:45.400 --> 03:35:46.240]  All right.
[03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:52.390]  If I was looking for them,
[03:35:52.710 --> 03:35:55.150]  it's the Hindu Durban
[03:35:56.430 --> 03:36:00.230]  that I would wanna be mining out of that.
[03:36:00.230 --> 03:36:04.190]  Super strong stocks, really tall,
[03:36:04.190 --> 03:36:05.510]  sort of Christmas tree.
[03:36:05.510 --> 03:36:08.470]  More palm tree than Christmas tree.
[03:36:08.470 --> 03:36:11.110]  Huge, massive donkey dick top coal
[03:36:11.110 --> 03:36:13.150]  as would be great for Sea of Green.
[03:36:14.790 --> 03:36:17.910]  I like to top it once and have two massive donkey dicks.
[03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:20.030]  That's my favorite way to-
[03:36:20.030 --> 03:36:21.110]  That blue cheese is good too.
[03:36:22.110 --> 03:36:23.190]  A lot of the crew around here
[03:36:23.190 --> 03:36:25.710]  ran blue cheese commercially on the indoors.
[03:36:25.710 --> 03:36:27.070]  So I saw a lot of the blue cheese
[03:36:27.070 --> 03:36:28.590]  and it's a good solid plant.
[03:36:28.590 --> 03:36:30.550]  And when you add the complexity
[03:36:30.550 --> 03:36:33.230]  that's gonna come in from that Durban Hindu,
[03:36:33.230 --> 03:36:34.230]  it'd be interesting.
[03:36:35.270 --> 03:36:39.950]  I like how it was a short plant and now it's a tall plant.
[03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:44.190]  I think it's probably the blue cheese
[03:36:44.190 --> 03:36:46.670]  or the purple kush making it a little bit leggy,
[03:36:46.670 --> 03:36:49.670]  but it just ends up real thick, really nice.
[03:36:53.440 --> 03:36:56.560]  All right, so we got a Windy City Garden at 150.
[03:37:00.780 --> 03:37:03.260]  And by the way, I'm exhausted
[03:37:03.260 --> 03:37:05.060]  and I'm on West Coast time right now.
[03:37:05.060 --> 03:37:06.820]  So I'm impressed.
[03:37:06.820 --> 03:37:07.660]  Oh shit, I know.
[03:37:07.660 --> 03:37:10.660]  Anyone who's not on the West Coast who's still awake.
[03:37:11.860 --> 03:37:15.100]  I'm on the East Coast, it is 1150.
[03:37:15.100 --> 03:37:19.460]  I am got about three and a half grams of RSO in me
[03:37:19.460 --> 03:37:21.820]  at this point, I feel lovely.
[03:37:21.820 --> 03:37:23.220]  Every time he talks, it's like,
[03:37:23.220 --> 03:37:25.100]  it's just a little bit more.
[03:37:25.100 --> 03:37:25.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:37:25.940 --> 03:37:28.180]  I had 11 more grams of RSO.
[03:37:30.060 --> 03:37:32.340]  Lord, I'm trying to quit smoking cigarettes.
[03:37:32.340 --> 03:37:33.740]  I smoke like nine joints
[03:37:33.740 --> 03:37:35.940]  since we've been on this YouTube video.
[03:37:35.940 --> 03:37:36.780]  It's a-
[03:37:36.780 --> 03:37:39.020]  I'm not sure if it's growing
[03:37:39.020 --> 03:37:40.940]  or if you're just actually keep stuffing more
[03:37:40.940 --> 03:37:42.380]  down your throat.
[03:37:42.380 --> 03:37:44.940]  No, I just keep like just smoking
[03:37:44.940 --> 03:37:47.420]  and wishing that they were cigarettes.
[03:37:47.420 --> 03:37:49.020]  And then all of a sudden it hits you
[03:37:49.020 --> 03:37:50.660]  and you're like, you wanna eat everything.
[03:37:50.660 --> 03:37:52.500]  I just looked at Shannon and muted this thing.
[03:37:52.500 --> 03:37:55.060]  I'm like, fix me everything.
[03:37:56.020 --> 03:37:57.620]  I'm starving right now.
[03:37:57.620 --> 03:37:59.700]  Yeah, it's a-
[03:37:59.700 --> 03:38:01.340]  I just realized I hadn't fed Quinn
[03:38:01.340 --> 03:38:02.580]  and she's like, oh fuck.
[03:38:02.580 --> 03:38:03.420]  I just fed her.
[03:38:03.420 --> 03:38:04.340]  She's like, all right.
[03:38:06.380 --> 03:38:09.420]  All right, Huncho Grown is at 180.
[03:38:10.420 --> 03:38:12.420]  Up Huncho Grown's at 225.
[03:38:14.700 --> 03:38:17.500]  I think Huncho Grown just outbid Huncho Grown.
[03:38:18.340 --> 03:38:19.500]  Outbidden himself.
[03:38:20.380 --> 03:38:21.860]  There was a bid for 200.
[03:38:22.060 --> 03:38:23.780]  There was a 200.
[03:38:23.780 --> 03:38:24.620]  Yeah.
[03:38:24.620 --> 03:38:25.460]  I missed that.
[03:38:25.460 --> 03:38:26.820]  Oh yeah, Jon Jon.
[03:38:26.820 --> 03:38:27.980]  Yeah.
[03:38:27.980 --> 03:38:28.980]  From Australia.
[03:38:28.980 --> 03:38:30.420]  All right, so at least Jon Jon,
[03:38:30.420 --> 03:38:31.580]  it's daytime for you.
[03:38:31.580 --> 03:38:33.460]  You're well rested.
[03:38:33.460 --> 03:38:34.300]  Tomorrow.
[03:38:35.180 --> 03:38:37.460]  Right, it's a workday.
[03:38:39.180 --> 03:38:42.900]  Is it everyday workday?
[03:38:45.460 --> 03:38:48.560]  So you're ready to ship to-
[03:38:48.560 --> 03:38:50.320]  Actually, while you're in Vancouver,
[03:38:50.320 --> 03:38:52.160]  shipping to Australia.
[03:38:52.280 --> 03:38:53.120]  Lovely.
[03:38:54.600 --> 03:38:55.760]  Yeah, you guys have the Commonwealth.
[03:38:55.760 --> 03:38:56.600]  That's no problem.
[03:38:56.600 --> 03:39:01.890]  You don't have to probably do any documents,
[03:39:01.890 --> 03:39:03.370]  I would imagine.
[03:39:03.370 --> 03:39:04.210]  Nope.
[03:39:05.690 --> 03:39:07.490]  Huncho Grown's at 240.
[03:39:09.250 --> 03:39:21.220]  So Josh, have you calculated what we've raised so far?
[03:39:24.900 --> 03:39:25.820]  We are,
[03:39:25.860 --> 03:39:27.580]  getting close to 10 grand.
[03:39:27.580 --> 03:39:28.740]  That's fucking amazing.
[03:39:28.740 --> 03:39:30.220]  I mean, that's-
[03:39:30.220 --> 03:39:31.060]  Yeah.
[03:39:31.060 --> 03:39:31.900]  Yeah.
[03:39:31.900 --> 03:39:33.380]  We've definitely broke the 9,500.
[03:39:33.380 --> 03:39:34.700]  I don't have it down to the dollar here,
[03:39:34.700 --> 03:39:36.580]  but we've definitely broke the 9,500.
[03:39:38.220 --> 03:39:39.260]  It's fucking cool, you guys.
[03:39:39.260 --> 03:39:41.180]  Thank you everyone that's participated.
[03:39:41.180 --> 03:39:43.340]  Thanks, Kev, for starting this.
[03:39:43.340 --> 03:39:46.340]  It just feels fucking cool to help a dude out.
[03:39:46.340 --> 03:39:48.700]  I know Delano's gonna be fucking stoked.
[03:39:50.580 --> 03:39:52.620]  I'm gonna go ahead and close the show.
[03:39:52.620 --> 03:39:53.940]  I'm gonna close the show.
[03:39:53.980 --> 03:39:54.820]  Stoked.
[03:39:55.940 --> 03:39:56.780]  Nice.
[03:39:56.780 --> 03:39:58.140]  And the people receiving the seed stock
[03:39:58.140 --> 03:39:59.260]  are gonna be stoked because they're getting
[03:39:59.260 --> 03:40:00.420]  their hands on some cool shit too.
[03:40:00.420 --> 03:40:02.820]  So it's a good night.
[03:40:03.660 --> 03:40:04.620]  Yeah.
[03:40:04.620 --> 03:40:06.100]  Yeah, and whoever's got those,
[03:40:06.100 --> 03:40:08.180]  or it's actually, I know exactly who's got it.
[03:40:08.180 --> 03:40:12.260]  It was Staten Island got both those runs for you, dude.
[03:40:12.260 --> 03:40:13.100]  Yeah.
[03:40:13.100 --> 03:40:13.940]  Yeah.
[03:40:13.940 --> 03:40:15.340]  So that's-
[03:40:19.480 --> 03:40:22.720]  Yeah, Staten Island, we need you for the next auction too.
[03:40:22.720 --> 03:40:24.760]  Whatever that may be for.
[03:40:25.120 --> 03:40:26.080]  We're gonna have to make those, bro,
[03:40:26.080 --> 03:40:27.720]  and get back to us.
[03:40:29.440 --> 03:40:31.000]  Yeah, Staten Island can auction
[03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:33.720]  whatever he makes off in the next week.
[03:40:33.720 --> 03:40:36.280]  No, for real, because there's none of that stock.
[03:40:36.280 --> 03:40:37.120]  Yeah.
[03:40:37.120 --> 03:40:38.160]  That's the problem is that
[03:40:38.160 --> 03:40:39.680]  that shit isn't getting made anymore.
[03:40:39.680 --> 03:40:40.920]  You can't go rebuy it.
[03:40:40.920 --> 03:40:42.160]  You can't go re-find it.
[03:40:42.160 --> 03:40:44.760]  You gotta have weirdos like me that vault this shit.
[03:40:44.760 --> 03:40:48.360]  No, if you seriously just did even a one-lighter,
[03:40:48.360 --> 03:40:51.960]  opened it up, all of those seeds,
[03:40:51.960 --> 03:40:53.400]  and just open pollinated them,
[03:40:53.400 --> 03:40:56.560]  and then you take, that's the way to do it.
[03:41:07.510 --> 03:41:09.630]  It's about, it's trying to destroy
[03:41:09.630 --> 03:41:11.470]  every rabbit on my property.
[03:41:12.590 --> 03:41:13.670]  Your dog is?
[03:41:13.670 --> 03:41:14.630]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:41:14.630 --> 03:41:16.310]  She's a, that's her mission in life,
[03:41:16.310 --> 03:41:17.630]  destroying the rabbits.
[03:41:19.230 --> 03:41:21.830]  Well, man, you can definitely expect wrong life
[03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:23.110]  out of her doing that shit,
[03:41:23.110 --> 03:41:25.110]  because her grandmother is 13 years old,
[03:41:25.110 --> 03:41:27.150]  and she tried to kill a duck earlier today.
[03:41:27.150 --> 03:41:32.150]  So, well, and her father is sitting at my feet.
[03:41:32.190 --> 03:41:35.550]  So, that is a, they're just very high
[03:41:35.550 --> 03:41:37.270]  on trade drive on that stuff.
[03:41:39.510 --> 03:41:42.590]  But yet, weirdly, they get along with all the cats.
[03:41:42.590 --> 03:41:45.630]  It is very odd, the pig, the goats.
[03:41:45.630 --> 03:42:00.240]  So, what's up for auction right now?
[03:42:02.200 --> 03:42:07.200]  We just wrapped up the blue cheese,
[03:42:07.400 --> 03:42:11.360]  purple cush, cross with Durban 14 Hindu cush
[03:42:11.360 --> 03:42:14.680]  for $2.40 to Honcho Grown.
[03:42:14.680 --> 03:42:15.760]  Beautiful.
[03:42:15.760 --> 03:42:16.880]  Nice.
[03:42:16.880 --> 03:42:17.720]  All right.
[03:42:18.920 --> 03:42:19.960]  That was a success, man.
[03:42:19.960 --> 03:42:21.600]  Thank you so much.
[03:42:21.600 --> 03:42:22.680]  Yes, man.
[03:42:22.680 --> 03:42:25.800]  And that's where you're going to make your donation.
[03:42:25.800 --> 03:42:30.520]  And then, sorry, who won that?
[03:42:30.520 --> 03:42:31.360]  Honcho Grown.
[03:42:31.360 --> 03:42:32.880]  Honcho Grown.
[03:42:32.880 --> 03:42:36.640]  So, Honcho Grown, send me an email,
[03:42:37.080 --> 03:42:42.080]  and I'll connect you with, can I use your name?
[03:42:42.200 --> 03:42:43.040]  Sure.
[03:42:43.040 --> 03:42:43.880]  Brian.
[03:42:45.200 --> 03:42:46.840]  So, I'll connect you with Brian.
[03:42:48.000 --> 03:42:49.280]  Let me just write.
[03:42:49.280 --> 03:42:51.720]  Yes, oh my God, you are a step ahead of me.
[03:42:55.160 --> 03:42:57.720]  All right, so go there to make your donation.
[03:43:00.320 --> 03:43:02.520]  Peter, you're a fucking trooper, dude.
[03:43:02.520 --> 03:43:04.600]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:43:05.440 --> 03:43:10.440]  Oh, Jesse Dodd, a pack of unreleased cherry lime dog.
[03:43:11.880 --> 03:43:13.360]  Oh, shit.
[03:43:13.360 --> 03:43:14.680]  What do we think about that?
[03:43:14.680 --> 03:43:15.520]  Fuck me, man.
[03:43:15.520 --> 03:43:16.760]  I mean.
[03:43:16.760 --> 03:43:19.800]  Are we gonna get over 10,000?
[03:43:19.800 --> 03:43:21.800]  Let's get past 10,000.
[03:43:21.800 --> 03:43:23.640]  We can all go for another five minutes.
[03:43:23.640 --> 03:43:26.080]  And freeze it at Jesse,
[03:43:26.080 --> 03:43:28.360]  but that's an incredible selection.
[03:43:28.360 --> 03:43:29.880]  And thank you so much, Jesse.
[03:43:29.880 --> 03:43:32.480]  That, his dog lines are killer, man.
[03:43:33.480 --> 03:43:36.120]  Jesse's done a really good job
[03:43:36.120 --> 03:43:37.600]  putting together work for a while,
[03:43:37.600 --> 03:43:40.440]  but I was just reading about that cherry collab he did, man.
[03:43:40.440 --> 03:43:42.000]  It's supposed to be gorgeous.
[03:43:42.000 --> 03:43:46.440]  Nick, I'll put 250 on it, if you put 250 on it.
[03:43:46.440 --> 03:43:48.520]  I'll put 250 on it.
[03:43:48.520 --> 03:43:51.200]  I even just muted it and said Shannon.
[03:43:51.200 --> 03:43:53.040]  I mean, they posted,
[03:43:53.040 --> 03:43:56.200]  he posted a picture on Instagram, two of them.
[03:43:56.200 --> 03:43:58.040]  And I'm not no Instagram guy,
[03:43:58.040 --> 03:44:01.880]  as far as that's to say I'll be all as far as pictures.
[03:44:02.640 --> 03:44:04.400]  I've talked with Jesse a couple of times,
[03:44:04.400 --> 03:44:06.520]  but Jackson reposted it.
[03:44:06.520 --> 03:44:09.760]  And it's just stupid gorgeous.
[03:44:09.760 --> 03:44:11.400]  And they put a lot of work into that,
[03:44:11.400 --> 03:44:13.280]  that black dog and everything else.
[03:44:13.280 --> 03:44:15.440]  Yeah, no, Jesse's work is,
[03:44:15.440 --> 03:44:17.800]  BioVortex does nice work.
[03:44:17.800 --> 03:44:18.920]  I have a smart guy.
[03:44:18.920 --> 03:44:21.800]  I don't know if we can pull that picture up, Peter.
[03:44:24.040 --> 03:44:25.280]  What am I pulling?
[03:44:25.280 --> 03:44:26.720]  All right, so first of all,
[03:44:28.120 --> 03:44:29.880]  look who just joined us.
[03:44:29.920 --> 03:44:32.840]  His audio is, he's connected.
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:39.520]  So what did we auction off the coffee cube for?
[03:44:40.920 --> 03:44:45.690]  The coffee cube went for,
[03:44:45.690 --> 03:44:47.450]  it's hard to move in the dark here.
[03:44:51.430 --> 03:44:52.710]  Can you hear me?
[03:44:52.710 --> 03:44:54.470]  What's up, Kaya?
[03:44:54.470 --> 03:44:55.590]  How's it?
[03:44:55.590 --> 03:44:56.430]  What's up, Nick?
[03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:58.430]  What's up, bro?
[03:45:00.430 --> 03:45:01.750]  Dude, what, how y'all doing?
[03:45:01.790 --> 03:45:04.790]  Let me find some place where I got some light, maybe.
[03:45:04.790 --> 03:45:06.350]  Standing out here in the dark.
[03:45:08.230 --> 03:45:11.590]  So we auction off both your packs.
[03:45:13.150 --> 03:45:13.990]  There we go.
[03:45:15.190 --> 03:45:16.030]  All right.
[03:45:18.110 --> 03:45:19.070]  What's up, boys?
[03:45:20.510 --> 03:45:21.510]  Can you read it?
[03:45:23.550 --> 03:45:26.670]  Yeah, we got 825 for both packs.
[03:45:26.670 --> 03:45:27.510]  Wow!
[03:45:28.430 --> 03:45:29.270]  Thank you, sir.
[03:45:30.270 --> 03:45:31.790]  Wow, that's awesome.
[03:45:33.150 --> 03:45:34.830]  How you doing?
[03:45:34.830 --> 03:45:35.670]  Good, man.
[03:45:35.670 --> 03:45:37.230]  How you doing?
[03:45:37.230 --> 03:45:38.070]  Trying to stay cool.
[03:45:38.070 --> 03:45:40.150]  It's so hot out right now.
[03:45:40.150 --> 03:45:42.150]  Dude, I was just talking your game up, dude,
[03:45:42.150 --> 03:45:43.110]  about that coffee.
[03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:46.110]  Like that is, I told everybody my top three,
[03:45:46.110 --> 03:45:47.790]  if I had a desert island would be,
[03:45:47.790 --> 03:45:49.670]  the coffee would be on my list.
[03:45:49.670 --> 03:45:51.550]  Oh yeah, coffee maybe means-
[03:45:51.550 --> 03:45:53.550]  I'm a blue in the top.
[03:45:56.430 --> 03:45:58.230]  Are we on the same island?
[03:45:58.230 --> 03:45:59.070]  Yeah, bro.
[03:46:02.470 --> 03:46:03.830]  That's good stuff, man.
[03:46:05.190 --> 03:46:08.510]  There's a big population on that really small island, yeah.
[03:46:08.510 --> 03:46:09.990]  Yeah, so-
[03:46:09.990 --> 03:46:12.430]  Yeah, we're all hanging out in the same bucket spot.
[03:46:14.270 --> 03:46:15.430]  Got the goods.
[03:46:16.630 --> 03:46:18.710]  So, all right, so just quickly,
[03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:21.510]  we're on Jesse's
[03:46:24.310 --> 03:46:25.950]  Cherry Lime Dog.
[03:46:25.950 --> 03:46:27.110]  What do you wanna,
[03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:28.830]  I know you guys wanna bid yourselves,
[03:46:28.830 --> 03:46:30.910]  but what do you wanna start the bidding at?
[03:46:30.910 --> 03:46:33.990]  500, me and Nick will start our offer at 500.
[03:46:33.990 --> 03:46:37.190]  All right, so 500 is the opening bid.
[03:46:37.190 --> 03:46:42.190]  And Nick and Josh are very competitive on this one.
[03:46:42.230 --> 03:46:45.710]  And then we could have waited to bid our 500.
[03:46:45.710 --> 03:46:47.630]  That way we could have grabbed this one.
[03:46:47.630 --> 03:46:49.990]  10 pack of regulars, is that what we're doing?
[03:46:51.390 --> 03:46:52.990]  Let me-
[03:46:52.990 --> 03:46:55.710]  I don't wanna spell dog, there's like seven ways.
[03:46:55.830 --> 03:46:57.150]  D-O-G.
[03:46:57.150 --> 03:46:57.990]  D-O-G.
[03:47:00.630 --> 03:47:03.310]  They just posted in the last five, six days
[03:47:03.310 --> 03:47:05.430]  some pictures of this on Instagram.
[03:47:05.430 --> 03:47:07.510]  It just was stupid gorgeous.
[03:47:08.590 --> 03:47:10.310]  I know Jackson reposted it.
[03:47:14.590 --> 03:47:16.910]  I'm running some of the cherry lion right now
[03:47:16.910 --> 03:47:18.870]  in my backyard.
[03:47:22.280 --> 03:47:23.120]  Come here.
[03:47:24.120 --> 03:47:28.000]  Just to be clear, this is Pacific Northwest Roots?
[03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:28.960]  Yep.
[03:47:28.960 --> 03:47:31.680]  No, sorry, this is BioVortex.
[03:47:31.680 --> 03:47:32.960]  Oh, BioVortex, okay.
[03:47:34.400 --> 03:47:36.960]  And that's what we're talking about, correct?
[03:47:38.680 --> 03:47:39.760]  Yes.
[03:47:39.760 --> 03:47:41.920]  Jesse's on the coast like me,
[03:47:41.920 --> 03:47:44.280]  he's down in Santa Cruz, right?
[03:47:44.280 --> 03:47:45.240]  Right on the water.
[03:47:46.320 --> 03:47:49.200]  He's like pretty funnel dominant from what I've seen.
[03:47:50.480 --> 03:47:51.320]  Fire.
[03:47:53.800 --> 03:47:54.640]  Big fire.
[03:47:56.000 --> 03:47:57.960]  Yeah, the black dog's super resistant.
[03:47:59.560 --> 03:48:00.920]  Oof, that's a nice picture.
[03:48:07.420 --> 03:48:10.180]  All right, so has someone topped the 500?
[03:48:15.640 --> 03:48:17.360]  I know, 20.
[03:48:17.360 --> 03:48:19.800]  20 seeds.
[03:48:19.800 --> 03:48:20.640]  Ooh.
[03:48:23.680 --> 03:48:24.960]  That's a good deal.
[03:48:24.960 --> 03:48:25.800]  Yeah.
[03:48:27.080 --> 03:48:28.120]  This stuff is nice, man.
[03:48:28.120 --> 03:48:30.080]  Jesse's got his shit together.
[03:48:30.080 --> 03:48:31.880]  He's a regenerative whiz too,
[03:48:31.880 --> 03:48:33.280]  but he breeds some really good work.
[03:48:33.280 --> 03:48:36.680]  I know a lot of people in Humboldt that run his stock
[03:48:36.680 --> 03:48:41.200]  and just good, solid outdoor stock.
[03:48:41.200 --> 03:48:43.800]  I haven't seen any of it run inside,
[03:48:43.800 --> 03:48:46.040]  but the outdoor work has been beautiful.
[03:48:48.160 --> 03:48:49.320]  And then Jackson's cherry,
[03:48:49.320 --> 03:48:51.720]  I think they did a little collab together, right?
[03:48:56.880 --> 03:48:58.120]  Can hear the crickets.
[03:49:00.320 --> 03:49:03.120]  All right, so wait, so is the only bid from,
[03:49:04.520 --> 03:49:05.360]  so far.
[03:49:05.360 --> 03:49:06.440]  Josh and Nick?
[03:49:06.440 --> 03:49:07.280]  Yeah.
[03:49:07.280 --> 03:49:08.120]  I'm good with that.
[03:49:09.400 --> 03:49:10.240]  Yeah.
[03:49:16.870 --> 03:49:20.230]  Jose Garza wears the butt, it's all fans.
[03:49:21.790 --> 03:49:24.030]  That's a nice pack though, man.
[03:49:24.030 --> 03:49:27.110]  Jackson's cherry into that black dog to be banging.
[03:49:27.110 --> 03:49:27.950]  Yeah, dude.
[03:49:31.560 --> 03:49:33.160]  We didn't, Nick and I worked together.
[03:49:33.160 --> 03:49:34.000]  Oh, really?
[03:49:34.000 --> 03:49:35.880]  It's pretty fun.
[03:49:39.440 --> 03:49:41.240]  Josh, you're super quiet now.
[03:49:41.360 --> 03:49:43.200]  We got a Posi bear at 550.
[03:49:43.200 --> 03:49:45.960]  On the laptop, I lost my headset.
[03:49:45.960 --> 03:49:46.840]  The battery died.
[03:49:47.800 --> 03:49:49.800]  Yeah, you gotta lean in.
[03:49:49.800 --> 03:49:51.160]  Posi bear coming in at 550.
[03:49:52.440 --> 03:49:53.280]  Wait, what?
[03:50:02.000 --> 03:50:02.840]  Where are we at?
[03:50:02.840 --> 03:50:03.920]  550?
[03:50:03.920 --> 03:50:04.920]  550.
[03:50:06.040 --> 03:50:10.200]  So Jesse just texted me,
[03:50:10.200 --> 03:50:15.200]  F1 equals H gas cherry lime pop 2016
[03:50:15.480 --> 03:50:18.200]  cross with black dog BC4.
[03:50:19.440 --> 03:50:20.480]  Yeah, what he said.
[03:50:21.960 --> 03:50:23.800]  You can't type all that.
[03:50:23.800 --> 03:50:24.640]  Yeah.
[03:50:25.520 --> 03:50:28.120]  I'm trying to, hold on, let me see if I can,
[03:50:29.680 --> 03:50:36.680]  hold on, no, that's not gonna work.
[03:50:38.240 --> 03:50:41.640]  Anyway, it's some good shit and it's 20 seeds.
[03:50:41.640 --> 03:50:42.480]  Yeah.
[03:50:44.280 --> 03:50:47.080]  Yeah, I ran the black dog in my greenhouse last year
[03:50:47.080 --> 03:50:48.280]  and it was great.
[03:50:48.280 --> 03:50:49.520]  And I've got the cherry lion,
[03:50:49.520 --> 03:50:51.680]  which I think has got some of those same genetics
[03:50:51.680 --> 03:50:53.200]  that I'm running in my backyard right now.
[03:50:53.200 --> 03:50:56.000]  So yeah, that's no joke.
[03:50:56.000 --> 03:50:58.680]  Big, big, big, big weed right there.
[03:50:58.680 --> 03:51:02.960]  Jesse was cool enough to give me like a jar of the black dog
[03:51:04.840 --> 03:51:06.160]  at the reject conference.
[03:51:06.160 --> 03:51:08.360]  I don't know which year it was last year or the year before,
[03:51:08.360 --> 03:51:12.560]  but it's really cool to be able to spend that much.
[03:51:12.960 --> 03:51:15.160]  You just like smoke a jar of the strain and be like,
[03:51:15.160 --> 03:51:16.000]  okay, I got you.
[03:51:16.000 --> 03:51:17.440]  Because the first couple of joints,
[03:51:17.440 --> 03:51:20.720]  it takes you a second, but it's good shit.
[03:51:22.400 --> 03:51:24.800]  I think I stole some of that herb from you
[03:51:24.800 --> 03:51:26.240]  when you weren't looking.
[03:51:26.240 --> 03:51:27.080]  That's right.
[03:51:27.080 --> 03:51:27.920]  Yeah.
[03:51:27.920 --> 03:51:28.760]  It's so good.
[03:51:28.760 --> 03:51:29.600]  Yeah.
[03:51:31.960 --> 03:51:35.440]  And I think whatever the ending bid is,
[03:51:35.440 --> 03:51:38.480]  this gets us past $10,000, right?
[03:51:38.480 --> 03:51:39.880]  Oh yeah, for sure.
[03:51:43.160 --> 03:51:45.400]  Not bad for four hours of work.
[03:51:48.960 --> 03:51:51.080]  You guys are rock stars, I tell you what.
[03:51:53.280 --> 03:51:54.920]  You guys are doing it.
[03:51:54.920 --> 03:51:57.400]  Speaking of which, you gotta tell me about,
[03:51:58.960 --> 03:52:00.720]  this is what I popped at,
[03:52:01.960 --> 03:52:05.440]  I'm setting up a home grow at Tom's house
[03:52:05.440 --> 03:52:08.440]  who helps me out down here in LA.
[03:52:08.440 --> 03:52:11.000]  And you sent me the Righteous Flame.
[03:52:11.000 --> 03:52:13.400]  Can you tell me a little bit about that?
[03:52:13.400 --> 03:52:16.680]  So the Righteous Flame, it's got that crazy harlequin
[03:52:17.720 --> 03:52:18.880]  in it.
[03:52:18.880 --> 03:52:21.960]  And that was like the first real CBD strain
[03:52:21.960 --> 03:52:25.720]  that I had gotten into my stable.
[03:52:25.720 --> 03:52:27.640]  And it's just got that harlequin,
[03:52:27.640 --> 03:52:29.920]  it's such a great cherry flavor to it.
[03:52:31.560 --> 03:52:34.520]  Typical CBD style where, just didn't want to throw hash,
[03:52:34.520 --> 03:52:37.160]  but if you actually squished out the flowers
[03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:39.920]  and got the rosin from it direct,
[03:52:40.400 --> 03:52:43.080]  it was such a powerful medicine,
[03:52:45.240 --> 03:52:46.840]  pronounced cherry flavors.
[03:52:46.840 --> 03:52:49.320]  And that effect of just,
[03:52:49.320 --> 03:52:50.640]  I'd burn it when I got off of work
[03:52:50.640 --> 03:52:54.920]  and it would just stop all the tension in my shoulders
[03:52:54.920 --> 03:52:57.400]  and provided a great amount of relief.
[03:52:57.400 --> 03:52:59.240]  So we've essentially just bred that
[03:52:59.240 --> 03:53:02.000]  into some of our other lines.
[03:53:02.000 --> 03:53:06.200]  And so I wouldn't call it necessarily a CBD strain,
[03:53:06.200 --> 03:53:07.960]  but we call it CBD enhanced.
[03:53:07.960 --> 03:53:11.440]  So you'll definitely find some genotypes in there
[03:53:11.440 --> 03:53:16.160]  that will have higher percentages of the CBD in there,
[03:53:16.160 --> 03:53:18.760]  maybe more equal to a one-to-one ratio.
[03:53:18.760 --> 03:53:21.000]  I think that harlequin was actually a two-to-one
[03:53:21.000 --> 03:53:24.080]  or a nine-to-four, something like that along those lines.
[03:53:25.480 --> 03:53:28.120]  Yeah, and then there's the Fire Alien Freeze.
[03:53:29.200 --> 03:53:30.920]  So on that side of it,
[03:53:32.400 --> 03:53:36.080]  that Fire Alien is just a tank
[03:53:36.120 --> 03:53:38.760]  when it comes to resin production.
[03:53:38.760 --> 03:53:41.120]  And then of course we use that freeze again,
[03:53:41.120 --> 03:53:44.640]  just because it's got such great structure
[03:53:44.640 --> 03:53:47.080]  and such a unique effect to the stone.
[03:53:47.080 --> 03:53:49.680]  So I would expect out of those plants
[03:53:49.680 --> 03:53:50.760]  that you're gonna find something
[03:53:50.760 --> 03:53:53.520]  that's not a terribly huge stretcher,
[03:53:53.520 --> 03:53:55.540]  but maybe medium to big.
[03:53:57.120 --> 03:53:59.400]  Again, great structure and keep your eyes peeled
[03:53:59.400 --> 03:54:01.040]  for that cherry turp that just,
[03:54:01.040 --> 03:54:02.840]  it should jump right out at you.
[03:54:08.510 --> 03:54:10.990]  Big up Tom down there in LA.
[03:54:10.990 --> 03:54:15.310]  Yeah, so I'm gonna send you the videos
[03:54:15.310 --> 03:54:18.430]  we've been making from his backyard, which is comical.
[03:54:20.230 --> 03:54:23.630]  I call this series Tom's Not-So-Green Thumb,
[03:54:23.630 --> 03:54:28.030]  but the concept is like Tom's in his mid-60s
[03:54:28.030 --> 03:54:33.030]  and is a patient, had a serious motorcycle accident,
[03:54:33.350 --> 03:54:38.350]  and would rather smoke weed than take opiates
[03:54:38.590 --> 03:54:43.590]  and frustrated with the price you pay in dispensaries
[03:54:43.590 --> 03:54:46.750]  and then the quality you get for that price.
[03:54:46.750 --> 03:54:49.630]  And so we're setting them up with a home grow
[03:54:49.630 --> 03:54:52.230]  with the seeds you donated.
[03:54:52.230 --> 03:54:56.630]  And I've brought some people in to help out
[03:54:56.630 --> 03:55:01.630]  every couple of weeks with building soil and IPM
[03:55:02.630 --> 03:55:07.390]  and teaching him kind of the fundamentals
[03:55:07.390 --> 03:55:08.590]  of growing at home.
[03:55:09.790 --> 03:55:11.150]  Aaron Varney.
[03:55:11.150 --> 03:55:12.390]  Aaron Varney, private shopper.
[03:55:12.390 --> 03:55:14.830]  Holding it off, dude, yeah.
[03:55:14.830 --> 03:55:17.870]  He's a fucking homeboy up here in Washington State.
[03:55:17.870 --> 03:55:21.830]  He runs a couple, I don't know how many,
[03:55:21.830 --> 03:55:26.830]  more than a couple dispensaries and a fucking cool dude.
[03:55:27.670 --> 03:55:31.270]  Jonathan Davis, you are outbid.
[03:55:34.140 --> 03:55:34.980]  Hey, dude.
[03:55:34.980 --> 03:55:35.900]  Hey, dude.
[03:55:35.900 --> 03:55:36.740]  What's up, bro?
[03:55:39.540 --> 03:55:44.220]  All right, so just quickly, Aaron, let me cue up
[03:55:47.900 --> 03:55:52.900]  where you wanna go to collect your winnings,
[03:55:54.260 --> 03:55:55.700]  which is right there.
[03:55:56.540 --> 03:56:01.540]  Paypal.me slash Delano Selver.
[03:56:03.220 --> 03:56:08.220]  And with that, I think we've crossed the $10,000 mark
[03:56:10.300 --> 03:56:15.300]  for four hours of, so first of all,
[03:56:15.780 --> 03:56:19.500]  to everybody who donated and a bunch of you
[03:56:19.500 --> 03:56:22.380]  are on here right now, that was amazing.
[03:56:22.380 --> 03:56:23.700]  Thank you so much.
[03:56:23.700 --> 03:56:27.980]  I'm psyched to talk to him tomorrow and be like,
[03:56:27.980 --> 03:56:30.420]  we just raised over $10,000 for you.
[03:56:32.540 --> 03:56:37.100]  And to everybody watching, just can someone recap,
[03:56:37.100 --> 03:56:39.780]  Kevin, if you're, I can't see in the darkness,
[03:56:39.780 --> 03:56:41.620]  but I can't even tell if that's, oh, there you are.
[03:56:41.620 --> 03:56:42.460]  Yeah, that's your eyes.
[03:56:42.460 --> 03:56:43.300]  I'm still there, brother.
[03:56:43.300 --> 03:56:45.740]  I just see a black square box.
[03:56:46.780 --> 03:56:49.700]  Just because people were at, people tune in late
[03:56:49.700 --> 03:56:51.700]  and they're like, what is this for?
[03:56:51.740 --> 03:56:55.060]  So can you just quickly give the one minute recap
[03:56:55.060 --> 03:56:57.340]  of what we raise money for?
[03:56:57.340 --> 03:57:02.340]  It's basically for an entrepreneur in sustainable soil.
[03:57:04.060 --> 03:57:07.820]  Yeah, in Georgia, making sustainable soil.
[03:57:09.460 --> 03:57:11.420]  That's kind of what his company is about.
[03:57:11.420 --> 03:57:13.260]  So go for it.
[03:57:13.260 --> 03:57:16.700]  And Delano is just a really nice, sharp guy
[03:57:16.700 --> 03:57:18.860]  who's an expert composter.
[03:57:18.860 --> 03:57:21.780]  And he had reached out to me to just kind of share
[03:57:21.780 --> 03:57:24.660]  what he was doing for camaraderie.
[03:57:25.580 --> 03:57:27.420]  And he said, I wanted to launch my business
[03:57:27.420 --> 03:57:30.580]  and he'd asked me for some assistance in terms of
[03:57:30.580 --> 03:57:31.980]  how do you market the product?
[03:57:31.980 --> 03:57:33.940]  And so we started to take a look and we realized
[03:57:33.940 --> 03:57:35.460]  we needed to create more products
[03:57:35.460 --> 03:57:38.980]  so that people would be able to get their hands on it.
[03:57:38.980 --> 03:57:43.540]  And I said, I have some stock that I'll donate
[03:57:43.540 --> 03:57:45.860]  to try to drive some money to you.
[03:57:45.860 --> 03:57:48.500]  And it'll allow him to be able to purchase
[03:57:49.140 --> 03:57:51.460]  the raw materials and a hammer mill.
[03:57:51.460 --> 03:57:53.660]  So really what you're doing is you're helping
[03:57:53.660 --> 03:57:58.660]  another fellow cultivator develop their business.
[03:57:59.020 --> 03:58:00.700]  And I really appreciate it.
[03:58:00.700 --> 03:58:04.020]  I didn't expect to see so many people participate.
[03:58:04.020 --> 03:58:05.380]  I just thought I was gonna be really throwing
[03:58:05.380 --> 03:58:09.380]  my own stock up and I'm grateful.
[03:58:09.380 --> 03:58:10.220]  And so thank you.
[03:58:10.220 --> 03:58:11.540]  Like I said, I'd never even met Delano.
[03:58:11.540 --> 03:58:13.980]  We talk on the internet, but he's just a nice man.
[03:58:13.980 --> 03:58:18.220]  And he has a dream like we all do.
[03:58:18.940 --> 03:58:21.940]  It's nice to see people be able to work together
[03:58:21.940 --> 03:58:23.460]  collaboratively to achieve it.
[03:58:27.080 --> 03:58:28.400]  Really cool, dude.
[03:58:28.400 --> 03:58:30.280]  Thanks for inviting us all to be a part of it.
[03:58:30.280 --> 03:58:33.080]  Honestly, I think that everybody that bought seeds
[03:58:33.080 --> 03:58:35.800]  and donated seeds just feels really stoked
[03:58:35.800 --> 03:58:37.240]  to help somebody out, you know,
[03:58:37.240 --> 03:58:39.920]  and especially with all that's going on in the world.
[03:58:39.920 --> 03:58:40.760]  Feels good.
[03:58:40.760 --> 03:58:43.600]  So thank you for giving us that opportunity.
[03:58:43.600 --> 03:58:44.440]  Right on, man.
[03:58:44.440 --> 03:58:45.280]  Thank you.
[03:58:47.040 --> 03:58:47.880]  All right.
[03:58:48.000 --> 03:58:51.760]  So just quickly tomorrow,
[03:58:52.680 --> 03:58:56.920]  Josh, are we doing the tour of your farm in the morning?
[03:58:56.920 --> 03:58:58.440]  Yeah, man, we can go for it.
[03:58:59.520 --> 03:59:02.680]  All right, so we're gonna tour Josh's farm.
[03:59:02.680 --> 03:59:04.240]  Let's do 8 a.m.
[03:59:04.240 --> 03:59:06.960]  I gotta pull my daughter out of the crib at seven
[03:59:06.960 --> 03:59:08.840]  and then I usually make my coffee
[03:59:08.840 --> 03:59:11.280]  and then come into the garage,
[03:59:11.280 --> 03:59:13.920]  which is already about 95 degrees.
[03:59:15.080 --> 03:59:16.560]  Does that work for you?
[03:59:16.560 --> 03:59:17.920]  That works for me, man.
[03:59:17.920 --> 03:59:19.360]  And then Kevin,
[03:59:20.800 --> 03:59:24.560]  Ethan Russo said he could do four o'clock in the afternoon
[03:59:24.560 --> 03:59:29.440]  to talk chemotypes and kind of combining terpenes
[03:59:29.440 --> 03:59:33.920]  to have specific medicinal effects.
[03:59:33.920 --> 03:59:35.840]  Does four o'clock work?
[03:59:35.840 --> 03:59:37.480]  Yep, we're on.
[03:59:37.480 --> 03:59:42.480]  So we are on at 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.
[03:59:43.280 --> 03:59:45.960]  and possibly even at some point in between,
[03:59:46.840 --> 03:59:49.520]  but thanks to everybody who's not on the West Coast,
[03:59:49.520 --> 03:59:52.840]  who's up way past 9, 12 at night,
[03:59:52.840 --> 03:59:55.480]  everyone on the West Coast, go to bed too.
[03:59:56.520 --> 03:59:59.600]  We raised, I don't know the exact number,
[03:59:59.600 --> 04:00:03.200]  but over $10,000 for someone,
[04:00:03.200 --> 04:00:05.520]  an entrepreneur, small business guy,
[04:00:07.600 --> 04:00:10.160]  everybody who's on here is psyched
[04:00:10.160 --> 04:00:12.400]  to see what he can do with that money.
[04:00:13.400 --> 04:00:15.080]  Good things.
[04:00:15.080 --> 04:00:18.880]  And with that, we will kill the live stream
[04:00:18.880 --> 04:00:23.280]  and we'll see you all in the morning in Josh's backyards.
[04:00:25.280 --> 04:00:26.800]  Letter goes.
[04:00:26.800 --> 04:00:28.320]  Awesome, thank you so much.
[04:00:29.200 --> 04:00:30.200]  Thanks guys, peace.
