for for any kind of pen rosin's good right?
oh no i love i love it because i you know i i haven't touched a pen in in uh years because
you know i don't want like a hydrocarbon pen but uh the the rosin pens are very satisfying
oh especially it's changed traveling around the world right so stealth now
yeah it was always an issue at the airports finding a spot now you're like no problem
oh yeah this whole like every airport i go through i'm smoking on this
uh as soon as i step out of the door of the plane
so we gotta all right well we are live and we got uh i think loosely this was kind of like east
coast west coast right dave that's kind of what we talked about of uh sounds good kind of back in
the day la and back in the day new york and uh so the rest of us can chip in of i mean for me
it's interesting because like in the you know it went from like for me it went from like
brick weed to kind of in the mid 90s having stuff that was awesome but like i never thought
about names of anything it was just kind of what this guy ronnie who used to sell me bulk
out of uh he went to berkeley school of music up in boston and he'd have stuff that came in from
california from you know british columbia stuff that would occasionally come down from maine and
vermont uh but like name wise you know like i never really had any i think it kind of goes
hand in hand with west coast it was either if it was real early it was regional nairi columbian
oaxacan they went with kind of regional names a couple random names here and there like your
gold cliche type stuff panama reds all that and then right you started actually getting names for
weed some of the first ones i've like you know like northern lights haze for example they actually
started labeling the weed with a certain name instead of regional types i'm kind of like the
malawi end up going called the cob because it looked like corn cobs or the turds because they
were wrapping it in corn husk and it literally looked like a turd so even though that was an
african reed malawi it actually took on names probably those are some of the earlier name ones
that i could remember and this is all this is just didn't realize that at the time but i was born into
a high-end weed family that had lots of weed around since i was born all the way up there's
always been a great deal of weed around later on that ended up becoming experience but before as a
kid it was just something you didn't talk about real quietive real secretive that's what pops did
and you don't talk about it but yeah as far as the names go i think you're right early early mid 80s
you started getting names skunks and northern lights and whatnot like that and then the names
took off like crazy whether it was attributed to the weed profile or the look or just a cliche
name like cavorkian right the wheelchair bud it was so strong it'll put you in a wheelchair
you know what i mean so it was kind of all over the place no yeah no you're right you know really
like you know going back um you know to the eight to the 80s you know because really you know we just
we just get commercial colombian or mexican and none of that was you know even really
even really named back then but you know that back then you know i remember you know getting
you know like you said regionalized but you know the the hawaiian bud was kind of like some of the
first real green uh seedless bud that i you know i saw back in the day you know there was you know
some thai weed that came through and you know we didn't really see any haze per se by name
you know that was pretty probably pretty much more of a west coast thing and and i was really
a little bit younger you probably had to be a little bit more in the older crowd to get in to
get into that stuff but i mean i remember back in the day the hawaiian was two hundred dollars an
ounce you know and this was back in in the 80s and you know we were we were paying like
40 an ounce for you know the the commercial mexican or colombian and and really i guess
you know leading up until into the 90s you know i guess that's kind of like when you really started
seeing well you know you always had the names from amsterdam so there was always those strange
names seed seed lines that were named from amsterdam and so you know probably in the 90s i
probably started seeing some of the like the early pearl you know and the skunk ones and and stuff
like that you know and and then you know just leading leading in past that you know as people
started you know breeding more and you know and as dave said you know some of the stuff was just
was just named by you know the characteristics of of the flower or you know where it came from
the region of the united states or you know so um yeah that's you know how all the all the names
really started for me and just quickly chad to catch you up on the first three minutes of the
conversation it's kind of like regional history so you have dave who kind of you know la obviously
west coast epicenter and new york epicenter so that's kind of what we're talking about
real yeah sorry guys you got a extra credit early start on it but uh happy to be here and it's fat it
is it's fascinating because regionally whether it was then or today differences do exist so happy
you know my dad was scoring kilos in high school and that was at about 64 65 and the first they got
sesamelia that was weed with seeds in it the next big deal which was a big deal for them they got
sense amelia now they were able to get weed with no seeds in it so when you got went down there you
had your choice obviously there's a price difference right so you had sesamelia went to
sense amelia then my dad would tell me they were trying to pour like wine or sugar water on it to
try to sweeten the weed and what was interesting is my dad told me one day he goes yeah we would
go down there and the guy would say do you want the kind of smoke or for the bath and then i was
like wow this mexican guys are on it because they literally noticed cbd before we knew of cbd in a
way because that's why they said do you want this stuff for the bath and not to smoke so they already
knew there's probably a hemp type they didn't know by name but there was a hemp type that had
medicinal qualities for aches and pains and nerve issues because that's what cbd's address and then
they had the kind you smoke and then throughout those phases he would ask for the stuff without
the sugar and i know throughout the timeline like the big deal was getting lightly pressed or
unpressed how fresh was it i know a lot of the mexican and thai weeds are brown and golden
is because they weren't taking care of that well they were packed still wet and it took quite a
while for it to get here so just like our weed when we throw it in a cupboard it ox loses the
chlorophyll it oxidizes it goes golden and changes the appearance so i imagine a lot of these weeds
were probably really good if you're able to get them fresh right trimmed right packed correctly
they probably would have been amazing but the time by the time we got them they've already been
pretty molested via the transport and the smuggling routes and then right the next phase that i
remember as a kid like my dad loved the oaxacan they would get those unpressed and they were big
like turds going up the stems that was a big deal then he got real malawi cobs drop wrapped in the
the corn husk and whatnot and that was confusing to me as a kid because i knew what weed was but
i didn't really know but i would deserve what was going on i was like why are these guys wrapping
weed in corn husks like a tamales it didn't make sense right and they call it the turd when it
they take it out it looked like a turd little lumps and formed perfectly like little turds
and then they were getting tie sticks and little sticks big sticks compressed little groups of
sticks and some a little looser and then towards the 80s is when you know indicas and green stuff
showed up and i actually got my first indicas from friends not even out of my dad's network
because i basically what i was doing i was once i became aware of weed value i was pinching it
taking it to my cousin to sell man i must have found 300 wallets as a kid we rented a swap meet
and buy mini bikes i'd be like where'd you get the money from me oh we found a wallet so i was
pinching weed for a long time before i was smoking it then i started smoking it and then like noticing
when he would get good stuff i'd keep an eye on it grab some take it to my biker cousin who was
older and get some money so and then uh actually one of my other friends his older sister's husband
goes we can get some kush butt and i was like okay i want some i got a little by the way back in the
day we didn't they didn't use scales it was fingers right one finger two finger three finger
bags that's what you got not many people had scales if not they whipped out the finger thing
that balances and it's never accurate anyways but he had kush buds and we got it and there
were these little round green buds in the bag and i thought it was kush because they look like little
kushy green buds later on did i learn that's from afghanistan and hindu kush mountains and all that
and that was another thing early on the old guys called indica's hash plant anything from the
middle east it was referred to as a hash plant it wasn't really paki or afghani or any of the
hashes were labeled like that but the weed itself were just hash plants and i guess that's they were
so used to sativas with no exterior resin that when they got into because with so much exterior
resin that just hints the name hash plant and it wasn't till later on that they started
distinguishing mazars in different areas but i do remember my dad having boxes and boxes of kilos
of hash wrapped in cloth blonde lead with gold stamps like so many difference and those always
had the name lots of hash oil those always like that's afghani that's mazar that's paki there's
all kinds those always had a name but weed wise i don't think names took off like jay-jay said
until holland showed up and they they took off on the breeding because nobody in america really
bred i remember growing up as a kid my dad was having a heart attack because he had to get rid
of big cork bags full of seeds they didn't want seeds because one seed got you busted so they
hated seeds they were they wanted these things gone that was scary as hell having huge amounts
of seeds because obviously you get a bunch of mexican a few couple tons they try to rip out all
the seeds as much as they could to clean it up for the customers and then you're stuck with all
these seeds so there was a long time at least i know in california that you didn't see seeds
unless you got mexi weed yourself from mexico whatever it wasn't cleaned up and then even our
green bud didn't have seeds in it it's very uncommon to find seeds once they started getting
dutch genetics or indoor type stuff very rarely and then medical showed up and everything changed
completely and medical in california or okay yeah and because that was one of the earlier states to
kind of adopt a larger infrastructure and actually sungrown mids trevor welcome in
you're in california and you're familiar with that system i am i'm also in a very loud place right now
so um i may not be very good on the audio side but yeah uh definitely familiar with california
and medical and you know your audio is actually perfect i wanted to see if you could if you could
give maybe like a dave intro because you had you know he was on my radar through you a long time
ago and i'm psyched that he's finally on yeah so like tell tell us about golden coast genetics who
is this guy um i know dave i actually met dave at your event when i came down to la um three years
ago actually um that was the first time we met in person but dave and i had interacted for years
online and i knew him from the forum days he was originally on like icy mag in different forums
and then we interacted on instagram and the person who really turned me on today was mr bob hemphill
um he grew out i believe the vintage afghan um about six seven years ago and uh i got to smoke
some of the vintage afghan it was some of the it just immediately brought back memories of the herb
that i grew up on so as soon as i tried that and became aware of dave's work i immediately wanted
to meet up with him get to know him better and over the years i've been lucky enough to
every time i come down to la i'm able to reach out and meet up with him and he shared a lot of
information with me uh as you all know um just from the last couple moments like dave's a veritable
encyclopedia of the last 30 40 years of cannabis and um really experienced it as it happened so
he's a great resource and his his dad's background and everything is really unique so i think he's
somebody that we should all listen to and take every opportunity we can to hear what he's got to say
very awesome and anybody who watches this channel knows kind of the weight that
your opinion carries so uh definitely like i said it's honored to be here with you gentlemen
this evening and it sounds like you know before holland and before everything started indoors
pretty much everything was imported is that kind of the sense whether it was east coast or west
coast most of the stuff was just imports yeah one thing is psychoactive weed isn't necessarily
native to north america so yeah it's all imports it's definitely all imports it's i think
the hispanic culture had a lot to do with it because they were using it metadenicinal wise
and recreational wise probably before most of the carcassians or what we are are americans
throughout the 20s 30s 40s and 50s it would be more of the hispanics and maybe on the east coast
more of the black community the jazz community especially michigan and stuff like that so i think
they're the ones who who broke the water so to say for us and made other people be curious to try it
and then that starts to snowball effect and if you like it you kind of have no choice of evolving
with your knowledge and your experience and becoming a pot slobber or connoisseur that's
just how it is you know jj has like immense knowledge on the east coast right like and this
isn't stuff you're not you can't read it on the internet and get it you got to have been there
and do it right it's like you've been around the block you've experienced everything about this the
smells the atmosphere the vibes the people the locations and you can't get that on the internet
all we can do is share our experiences and all my experiences i didn't invent anything
i'm just learning hand-me-down stuff and maybe i expand on that a little bit but i don't know
if any of us has invented anything that was already known already you know this is we're
all like they say on the backs of other people's shoulders taking it to the next level we're all
stepping stones off one guy and where's the stone for the next guy to go step off of and
carry up the information and building blocks you know they definitely are they're the building
blocks of what you know the road that has been paved so you guys were kind of mentioning earlier
you know when name started to come into it was there a conscious effort to select some of these
things and build those building blocks or was it a lot of happy accidents in the profiles that were
maybe coming around maybe not directly from your garden but into the general market well for me it
was more about the selections because you know back in the day like you know you would you know
you know uh like shipments would come in of certain types of weed and like once it was gone it was
like a perpetual thing that you know in some instances it would be but you know when you talk
about smuggling like you know some trips are going to make it and some trips aren't going to make it
and then who's to say it's going to be the same exact product you know when you got a broker that
shop and you know i'm sure that they're you know getting anything that's going to be available to
so you know different shipments were you know it was what it was and you know once it was gone it
was gone forever so to speak and so if you're able to get seeds or anything like that from it and
you know back then too like you know to you know i i i was collecting seeds but i'd never really
separated them or labeled them or anything like that just put them into like one big bag and had
them all mixed up eventually the police took them from me anyway but you know when my my early
thought process was and i wasn't even growing back then was you know maybe you know one day
i'll be a grower and you know i'll be able to find some of these these older things that were around
and um yeah you know the you know the whole thing was just about trying to preserve the stuff that
you know we got on a regular basis once we started getting you know some of the indoor stuff and
and some of the clones were available you know because you know i i started off as just you know
as a dealer selling weed and new people that grew so you know i i knew the market and you know
what you know what the market wanted and so you know once we got like a certain type of weed that
we were getting on a consistent basis and it became popular you know and then it disappeared
and people like well what happened to that and you know you know we lost a clone or the room got
busted or you know there were so many scenarios of why we lost the clone and so you know once i
started growing you know that was really one of my main purposes of just breeding for my own
self-preservation this is all that had some kind of representation of every clone that i touched
basically and you know and i just really just started that's how i just started off doing
doing my own you know breeding and stuff was it a matter of kind of taking anything you could get
your hands on or were you still kind of weeding things out at that point be like yeah this will
be good for the market or not so much yeah well i guess kind of a little bit of both because like
back then you were lucky to get any clone that you could you know but then once you brought it to
market it didn't necessarily meant that it was a you know a big hit or a big demand
you know like the jack harrier being for one like you know early on you know we got some of the
original jack harrier i think i don't know if it was at the cup at 94 95 my friend went out
he got an original pack started growing them in 97 98 and you know when it first hit the market
you know it was it was pretty well received and you know and it but you know the the qualities
were kind of limited you know it was really more of a haze type of a head it didn't get you super
high and stuff but it was different from what was around and for those guys it i think it went like
maybe like 80 days or something like that but it but it produced it's huge like you know like colas
like really big yeah and so they were pulling like quarter pound half a pound off a plant
and back then that was kind of unheard of so they started just pumping that stuff out and then the
market got over saturated and then people you know didn't want to buy it anymore and then i had to
tell them they had to kill it and so you know so that was like one instance where you know you know
just kind of like had its little run in the sun and then you know once the weed doesn't sell anymore
and you're stuck with it you're like well we can't you know i i can't you can't keep growing
and i can't keep buying it if you know if i can't sell it so it was you know it's really a supply
and demand sort of a speak thing and so um you know and so we know whereas the sour diesel
like you couldn't have enough sour diesel so i mean you know back then i used to have
you know i'd get you know four or five pounds and i'd have some people come in and be like i'll buy
it all you know but whoa hold on you know like i got like you know 10 other people that will buy
buy all of it too you know i mean so i'd be like you know i could sell you maybe a quarter a half
a pound was usually my limit if you were lucky i used to every everyone would be allotted a quarter
pound and and then once everyone got their allotment whatever was left over then i would
kind of loosen it up a little bit but you know i had like a you know a pool of regular customers
you know some of these guys were also you know dealers and they used to bring me product and
you know so we do each other favors and so you know i couldn't let one person
monopolize the whole thing and you know and that's the way it was back then
well that's interesting that so the sour diesel really kind of came in more as less as a shipment
to distribute versus maybe something that you know you picked up as a clone and you were running
houses with that initially right oh no no i mean i mean it was it was all you know from clone you
know in-house that we that we were you know producing it ourselves you know it really wasn't
you know kind of like a you know what you're saying like a import or anything like that you
know all of this was you know among friends upstate new york you know in in and also in the
city so all all that was was controlled and you know all that really started you know once you
know i once i met the weasel in central park and you know he you know he had a little bit of a
network of growers and you know we it just kind of grew from there and you know and you know once
we had gotten the distribution down you know we were able to you know expand on on the amount of
people that you know wanted to grow and you know eventually i started growing myself so you know at
any point we could we would have like you know six or seven different people that were growing at the
same time and uh you know and i would be you know and so you know some people were bigger some people
were small you know you know back then some people only had a one light or two lights and some people
had five or six lights so you know you you know the it wasn't always a steady uh supply you know
sometimes people would shut down or you know so you know it was always shuffling back and forth
but you know it was you know the main thing was just trying to keep you know uh just keep that
that that supply coming through you know and and i was you know and i was the one that was
that was distributing everything and so i knew what the market what the market was and back then
you know it just there just wasn't enough good weed around so you know you know people would
you know if you had like a 10 pack people would just scoop it up but you know you we couldn't
even grow that much at one time so like i said if you got like four or five pounds at one time
that was a lot out of one room and dave too you were talking about kind of the building blocks
earlier and we're you know it kind of sounds like the 90s maybe is where some of the names
came in i mean that that kind of seemed like the general consensus was you guys had mentioned
holland earlier but i mean there were more names but we didn't have internet right and information
didn't travel as fast it took quite a while for us to learn what was going on there there i mean
like uh gosh 84s 85s they had names i went to reggae in the river in 89 and we already known
of trinity so that was our mission we got to reggae in the river we set up camp and every dude would
go a different direction looking for the trinity because that was our weed right and we could get
the trinity so that was 89 so there had been names it's just those names also were kind of
regionalized now not from not from out of the united states but now within the united states
you know you had you know like you said trinity and other parts of california that were producing
weed and they'd be like oh well where did you got get that weed from well you know i got it from
humble or i got it from trinity or you know whatever county or town and so it started to be
now specifically towards you know uh some some of the california uh locations well another thing too
is maybe if the weed even had a name we didn't use it because depending on your area you had your own
nomenclature for good weed right like they say crippy and this on the in florida and i don't
know new york you probably had some names these will do green bud this is pre-indo pre-chronic
they weren't even using those names yet indo and chronic didn't even exist like that the rap
african-american community wasn't really involved with weed because it got them in a lot of trouble
and if they're going to get in trouble they're going to deal with other stuff that's worth getting
in trouble for and that was like a big transition part two was weed breaks it's i think there's only
three things in the world probably music food and weed that breaks all racial barriers looks
languages body types i don't care if you're republican a nazi punk a ska guy i don't care
if you're a surfer a hippie you're going to have something in common and smoke a bowl together
so it you know and that was our information network like if you go to a big event you got
people coming from all over and that's where you learn something new and experience something new
and vice versa maybe they took something with them somewhere else and i think that's how that started
on top of your dutch seed companies like super sativa seed club they're a really early seed club
you know and sam's club they had to put some names like a menu because it's a product and they had to
distinguish their stuff and just like when medical started here before medical what was
there two breeders in the united states no one was doing that you know and then medical started
boom i noticed it i saw thc farmer and canna cabana and all that stuff and jj and captain
crip and all these guys doing stuff i was like whoa tom hill and these guys those are the first
guys elite genetics who isn't around anymore those are the first dudes and then it seemed like
as just like anything when something is risky there's value and less people do it the less
risk there is the least amount of value and the more people do it and as our transition from going
illegal to medical to recreational it's right in front of our face when it was illegal you got a
lot of trouble not many people mess with weed and then medical came you know people were still
hesitant but are started expanding and then once they realized medicals like insurance get out of
jail or if you crash your car it's a you know you're you play it right you're home free people
exploited it and then recreational came and now we're at a new point right just like the gold rush
the little guy finds it the guy with a little more money takes advantage of that guy he thinks he's
on top of the world but then bigger money comes and says surprise and smacks him in the face
even that guy thinks he's on top of the world until international corporational money gets
involved and everybody's going oh i never imagined this well no it's all right in front of us we're
at this step of that process and it is what it is there's always the bigger fish and to be
completely honest i hope you know the fed because i'm in washington where i saw it start with the
little guy got bought out by the middle guy we don't allow mso's but the second we do they'll
come and get the middle guy but ultimately i want them to be eaten up by the large person
in a fully legal system because then the little people like myself hopefully will be able to rise
on the merits of their product versus just sheer capacity but who knows what it's going to look
like in reality control over this because if we look at the history of marijuana laws it's not an
illegal substance it's a controlled substance and why they call it a controlled substance is they
either let a lot of marijuana out in the public or they crack down green harvest right all these
things they do when they want a lot of it out they'll they'll leave it alone but when they
want to crack down they'll come down hard this is the feds have a right why did they patent the hc
if it has no medical values a long time ago these guys are smart and they play the long game i think
what's going to be or what helps us is like craft beer our trends change so quick i can't see any
massive large-scale operations like anheuser-busch or budweiser being able to keep up with the
overhead of the market because the trends change so fast and i think that's why these craft ales
are taking off i don't drink beer but i notice the big guys can't mess with the craft ales because
the trends change too much and it's a weird little community in there right i think that's what
happened with cannabis because what they'll do is they'll do like apple and tesla and gap clothing
they'll that's already been told dupont has been in this for a long time they don't let nobody know
this big boys have been messing with this stuff for a long time they'll go off shores have areas
that have real low labor rates to grow this stuff trim it up put it on a boat and send it back and
no matter what they don't care about the quality right it's budweiser if the overhead is low the
profit margin is what counts they will do it and a clue to that will be when they deschedule it
because now the limits are off and it can be state to state i think one of the things that's holding
them back is uh united nations have certain laws against cannabis and that's might be what's holding
back the last straw until they can condition united nations and then relax those laws that'll
happen because that's what happened in california we're here now because of the gay people those
people were suffering from aids and cannabis worked for them and they had the power in san francisco
and that's the first place that happened with dennis perrone and all that era of people
they made it happen for the world they really opened the doors and made it accepted and that
trickled to la and around the world and here we are so and i think like every business on the planet
capitalism exploits it whether you like it or not capitalism exploits it but weed was i think the
last frontier what was controlled by us no outside entity ever had a control on it was a community
controlled environment we still have that a little bit i just don't know how long it'll last
it it's to a lesser degree for sure but trevor i don't know have you been following some of the
changes because i know the un has been looking at this over the last few years to get around
countries like uh i think it's paraguay but the import and export because that is going on between
canada and other countries so un has to eventually make some sort of change or alteration to the drug
treaties there yeah i think two years ago the world health organization had a big meeting and
people thought that there was going to be a change and move away from the single convention which is
the single treaty convention was i believe passed in 1960 and that's essentially where the un got
together and all the different member nations signed a treaty that it essentially said go and
ban cannabis or make cannabis a controlled substance in your local jurisdiction
um the united states at that time still had the hemp tax stamp act from 1937 on the books
but it got overturned in 1969 when timothy leary ended up challenging it and getting an overturn
and so there's a court case leary versus the united states that actually overturned the
uh hemp tax stamp act and the year after that that happened in 69 the next year the united
states passed the controlled substance act and so part of the controlled substance act getting passed
was to be in compliance with the single treaty convention that the u.s had already been a
signatory to since 1960 so yeah the un does need to get its act together and uh repeal the single
convention or at least you know amended to get rid of cannabis out of the controlled substances
um because as of right now under the un legally like basically the un has had different declarations
declaring for instance california's medical program to be in violation of the single treaty
convention and they really only want people to be focusing on hemp and industrial sort of
applications as opposed to recreational or medicinal so that's definitely a major issue
and um dave's on point there too about it's an under reported or under understood aspect of
medical legalization and how it progressed here in california dennis perrone very much was able to
spearhead the movement in response to the aids epidemic in the aids crisis and that's something
that a lot of people don't understand that were it not for the aids crisis and people coming
together and figuring out how to address that crisis outside of the traditional medical system
because in the 1980s the reagan administration was really slow in responding to the aids crisis
people were basically left to figure it out and san francisco general hospital was one of the
main epicenters for where things were happening and the hospital actually let brownie mary come in
and administer ganja brownies to patients because it was the only thing that people could eat and
keep down and actually stop the wasting that was happening because one of the side effects of
full-blown hiv aids is wasting and people couldn't keep down food so yeah that's that's a part of our
history and something that we really need to remember and recognize and always give credit
where it's due to dennis and everybody up in in the bay who really spearheaded the movement right
it was like texas fire club same type of thing that the guy was doing in texas that's what they
were doing is just trying to help people not suffer and if they were going to pass away they
want to make it as as you know as least suffering as possible for them and here we are and that's
the other thing to go back to what jj is saying there were things called dry seasons where you
took what you can get it didn't matter if it was i mean we didn't have nothing i remember smoking
banana peels and lettuce heads thinking they're gonna get you high because you read it in these
old get high stoner books and yeah you go to like drive-thrus of some sketchy neighborhood to get
whatever you could and then into september rolled around you're getting anxious because you knew
something was going to happen and through september to maybe january february you had the goo or the
good weed whatever had a name or not and then that tapered off and if you're lucky you got tie like
you know august july area you got the tie weed and then that went fast tapered off and you were stuck
like that's why i was lucky having my dad with having to do with the brotherhood and we
year round there was weed so that's the one thing it's like a vip pass especially when there's no
read around you got weed boy a lot of doors get opened up for you a lot of doors so i was very
fortunate and now i'm not i'm older i really realize holy crap the stuff i got to do because
of weed is unbelievable i've never never changed a thing because i never got to do any of that stuff
but yeah there were dry seasons and it was a time thing and like jj said it came and you better get
all your money together and grab it because if not the dude that is waiting down the street in
his car to pull up because that's what you had to do you had like call you know one dude gets to go
maybe you run down the street you couldn't leave right away but you couldn't hang out too long
right you couldn't run in run out and then you got your shit and go and boom you were gone
like we'd get an ounce and we'd make 28.09 bags and we get like two grams for ourselves for free
out of that ounce for 350 because that way we could sell it for like the 15 or gram or something
not really rip people off but we ended up getting some goo out of it for free
there was all kinds of little maneuvers we pulled just to have good weed
right i'm sure you guys know when you go to the party it was like show and tell
do you see so and so's weed oh do you see this guy's weed and well everybody was showing their
weed unfortunately those days are gone because everybody has the best weed nowadays
whoa my dad looks at this stuff and goes wow this stuff's out of control
right he went from see-through weed with seeds in it to where we are now it's like whoa
right from a dial-up phone to iphone we could talk to people on around the planet instantly
we're watching guys in afghanistan do stuff we've never been able to see before in our lives right
now this is amazing all this hash stuff we're seeing right now so i say welcome to the future
we should take advantage of it learn but you know we definitely can't forget our past definitely
can't forget the roots you know i don't think anybody now is going to know what a dry season is
and that experience you know you couldn't stay too long but you couldn't leave right away i always
call that experience the dealer's couch because that's where i met the kids from like the other
school districts and you know the like you said it crosses boundaries i would not talk to this
dude next to me normally black asian whatever you were friends and you guys had something in common
you crack jokes and stuff and i think that helped why california is so liberal because we've always
had that kind of hippie free love experiment do psychedelics and when you do any type of
mind-altering drugs you could become from this to this you see things more in a different perspective
and i think that's why like new york and the coast have always been pretty liberal with that stuff
middle america unfortunately has to pay catch up because they're real tight with their laws and
their mindsets there well you know both being one you know one of you from west coast one of you from
the east coast it definitely had to travel through the middle coast but you're also talking you know
we're talking about names and this was all pre-internet i saw buddy kilowatt make a comment
earlier he said dead tours were the internet before the internet so how were there certain
events or certain ways that those two kind of were bridged as far as the east coast west coast
sharing of mind sharing of strains the hippie trail my parents went to monterey pop festival
that was like our dead shows and reggae and the rivers or fish shows today were those events and
it was the same parallel thing we're doing now with just less knowledge and less people
but all doing the same thing go new event buying crafts trying food making your homemade stuff
right who has those mushrooms who has that lsd who has that weed same thing just i think on a
smaller scale and then as populations explode these scales expand as well and then like we say
with the internet it's like well i was a little mod kid like i had to wait for two weeks three
weeks to see what was going on in england now it's like poof right anything you want in your head you
can find it immediately so yeah it was it was different back then but we didn't know any
different so we couldn't say it was worse or better we didn't know it was what it was just
like my dad you know we kind of figured out yeah those weeds were really strong back in the day
but they can't compete with none of the weeds today because the tolerances back then were that
much lower if your highest weed was 12 right and you smoked a 13 or of course you're going to get
the head spins and get dizzy and think you're hallucinating right because their tolerances are
lower now everybody's drinking jagermeister doing dabs right that's the equivalent to it we're so
high up on tolerance that that's why the 24 percenters better have a certain amount of
terpene in it because 24 and don't do it no more but if you took 24 crappy 24 tested weed back to
1973 you'd have the whole party throwing up probably right can you imagine them doing the
dab back then no it would ruin the weed experience i bet less people would be into weed
i'm in i'm into flower i'm a flower guy 100 i agree with you for sure
you know jj i'm familiar with you know like reggae on the river i'm familiar with some of these west
coast events uh what was going on on the east coast was there a hub was there an annual like
okay this is where all the heads get together and you know go your own ways throughout the year
no well they had this thing called harvest fest that was up upstate new york and you know i i
never participated in that and it was really kind of you know just like uh once people would get
their outdoor finished they'd you know have this fest festival and you know they'd bring it up there
to showcase it and and show it around and everything but you know there wasn't really
you know uh any really tight community on the east coast you know there were just small pockets
of friends that would do stuff but um you know it was so sketchy back then that you know exposing
yourself in any way was just kind of you know you know it was just kind of considered foolish so
it was probably a pink floyd concerts and aerosmith and all those crazy bands like
steve miller band and all those weird type of events you know i imagine like you probably had
some uncles or aunts that were going to these events right jj no no no one in the family kind
uh wasn't it wasn't and i didn't have any family connections or anything like that i
pretty much found everything myself so you know you know everything i picked up you know was just
pretty much from you know the streets in new york and people just knew you know you know i pretty
much i tried to you know see how successful people operated and i tried to learn from them and uh
and did kind of apprenticeships with people and um yeah you know but you know touching back to like
some of the droughts and stuff and you know and and you know that really came in in in the same
same time when they had you know the war on drugs you know and and bringing imports in just wasn't
worth it anymore because they were getting busted and then they started bringing in the kilos of
cocaine and heroin instead maybe if you ever watched that movie blow that kind of depicts that
pretty well because in the beginning the guy was was just you know um flying bales of weed over and
then he you know turned over to into to the cocaine um but you know but during that same time too
you know once they they they stopped those imports i think that really made people
domestically start growing more and you know you you know you had the people in california
and you know that you know that was pretty much a seasonal outdoor thing and and then you know
you had the people up in um seattle and portland that really started the the indoor the whole
indoor thing and you know i guess that that kind of expanded kind of north and south from there
you know it expanded north into british columbia vancouver you know and then it you know then it
made its way down south in in into california and such so you know back then it was really about
you know the um about the information you know you you know to to find out and to learn that
information how how did you know how to successfully grow and you know do all of that you know because
when i first grew you know i just had some seeds i put some seeds in the closet and i put a you know
a light in there but i had no concept of you know the time that the time cycle or any of that kind
of stuff and you know so i just thought you know you pick the leaves off and smoke them so you know
that was really my very first attempt on trying to grow something and you know and it wasn't really
till later till you know someone kind of taught me and you know told me the whole process because
really the only way to get that kind of information was you know it was really in uh in the back of a
high times if you know if you went and ordered you know one of one of the grow books or if you
you know went to an underground bookstore somewhere in san francisco or maybe in greenwich village
and so you know so really you know that that information really um you know like dave was
saying you know didn't really explode until to the internet came out and you know and then once the
internet came out and you know people you know were showing their different methods and trial
trial and error methods and you know um you know we just really kind of um created our own community
and really you know brought the technology forward as best that we knew it at the time
and i know you know like high times this is the one a lot of people think of
on the west coast i know there was a sensimilla tips as well um but yeah like you said it didn't
really explode until the internet because just even the act of creating that magazine uh like
sensimilla tips put the feds on to tom alexander who happened to own a grow store which happened
to get busted in a green merchant operation and i think that was late 80s but he didn't wasn't
touching cannabis wasn't doing anything wrong it was just that association was still there where
the anonymity of the internet i think helped get more information out right because we couldn't say
boom you get out of the headshot for saying it was a water pipe for tobacco the hydro stores
nothing to do with weed they were growing tomatoes right like when i started in door
we didn't really have a hydro store we knew somebody that worked at the colleges by my house
so we got their sodium walkway lights and we put them in there and made our own little 70 watts in
each corner and 150 on top i had the mel frank book with the spiral binder and it said add
vermiculite perlite worm castings back guano i remember all of it blood meal and putting soil
put them in three plants they were seeds we got cat piss seeds from san diego state they had good
weed we went down there and got some cat piss there was seed in it planted it grew it i took
a picture in 93 i got by the month and made the cover i was like holy shit right and so our next
big deal was we got the parabolic reflectors we found a hydro store we could get extra edge that
was like the only hydro food you can get and we had like the two liter bottles of hydroton and
we had all types of different hydro then the next big deal is the lights had glass on them they're
like rectangle now and he had glass we're like whoa that's a big deal then the next big deal
is you had little ducted vents like on a volkswagen little louvers they had little louvers and we're
like oh this is tech we got the best stuff ever then you went from a four inch opening to a six
inch opening to an eight inch opening to vertical two tubes where you're going cool tubes where you
did the 1000 watt per four plants to right leds that look around with stupid colors that grew
your plants terrible and you couldn't notice bugs and they cost a million dollars to now de bulbs to
leds so i kind of been there since parabolic reflectors then just like jay just said you had
a book and you just went off where you could go off the book and when you had a problem you did
what you could do to learn what the problem is and try to solve it and you kept going
and then i did remember we by this time when the internet came out like aol and all these things we
were doing rooms of light so you got really in trouble so we all stayed away from the internet
i remember being on aol and some guys would make private chat rooms and we're talking about weed
and i was like whoa those guys are crazy then i heard of overgrow and i thought everybody was nuts
because we were growing a lot of weed for money why would you want to be on the internet talking
about weed that's the scariest thing in the world so i didn't get on the internet until i think
th see i met swerve and he's like we're starting this site you got to go on there so that's when
i got on the internet is swerve got me to go on the internet and then from there it was a weed
tracker that thing was amazing that changed the whole weed scene in california because when med
started they made like a weed maps but weed was so out of control kind of like new york that
everybody was on weed tracker every five minutes i just got this clone at this store this store
just got this and it was like a live update of every store in la all day long of everything they'd
get so you'd run a weed tracker and go they got those clones they got those clones and you zoom
zoom out to la and start collecting all your stuff that's when i started going crazy and
actually started breeding as i started collecting all these clone onlys then i went wait there's no
dads so if you lose these there's no way to back them up so i learned how to do feminized seeds and
that's what started my breeding was just backing up all the clone onlys then i started having extra
seeds and started selling and people liked them so that's why i started breeding based on the
collection of seeds i already had and all this stuff i had i was like i'm just going to breed
stuff that i like and if people like it awesome and i think from weed experience we've all honed
into the best weed and that's anything og chemi or in that gassy oily family whatever it may be
i don't know but that seems to be the best weed so that's where i home into and that's
kind of how my thing started is being a pot snob and always on the hunt for the holy grail
and now being able to breed is trying to breed your holy grail desert island weed
and that's pretty much golden coast is i breed for myself and other people like it awesome but i
don't just make something for the market or because people want it i guess unless i'm in
emergency and i'm going to go bankrupt yeah i might do that but no i try to make stuff i like
and i think what i like most people like it's quality i'm not too fond of purples too much at
all but like i tell people that they always say what's the best weed i said there's two types of
best weed there's the weed you like and the weed that gets you the most money that's the two best
weeds on the planet if your weed is blue dream that's your favorite weed that's the best weed
in the world if blue dream gets you the most money that's the best weed in the world because
it's like everybody has their own tastes and flavors right so no one can say this is the best
week it's all subjective yeah all subjective you like or get you the most money that's the best
weed you know and we went through all that six week we don't care as long as it finished in
six weeks we didn't care how long it was because we were getting money off it but then after a while
the market changes and people's knowledge expands and we're like we're not going for another top 39
or any of this six seven week shit no we want quality because quality takes longer so your
you your taste will evolve with the market and the market evolves with your taste kind of you go hand
in hand when you've been around for a while i think i'm sure it's the same for jj he found some weed
he really liked and was like wow and that's been his groove right jj you're into that line
and your mission is to always try to improve it work with the stuff at least like me i work with
the stuff i like and hopefully i can improve it or take it somewhere that other people like it or i
really like it and i did notice when i started breeding there was a the breeders would police
each other in a very respectful way jj was working with chems swerve had the sfe in the
tahoe right and rascal had the fire and captain crip had his nls and this and that and chrome had
the whites and no one danced on each other's toes like that we said hey do you want to do a collab or
can i use this there was a good deal of respect that's gone that's it's sad that's gone you know
everybody's like i don't care anymore well if you say i don't care then the other guy says i don't
say i don't care and how does it stop so that's kind of why i'll get in some tussles with some
people because i keep it real right i call them out like bro that's that guy's stuff or i'm playing
with this why would you do that there's three thousand five thousand strains out there why do
you happen to be working with the same thing that i'm working with huh like same thing you know jj's
working with this stuff but this dude's gonna take this and do the same thing jj's doing i'm like
this guy's been doing it longer than you what makes you think you're going to be able to do
the same thing better i kind of think the key word there is work um you gentlemen will work lines
whereas i think other people's will just smash them together and then call that done but i know
trevor you you've grown some of the the golden coast genetic stuff did you have anything that
uh you know was your kind of personal favorite or stuck out there just tell them about the bad stuff
um so i grew out the vintage afghan um the calamity jane and uh i think it was lemon bubba
um and so each one of those i loved each one of them um there was definitely i popped a lot i
think about a thousand seeds when i went through those and there was definitely a keeper in each
one of them the calamity jane was like basically like chemd um really sandy resin huge gassy chunky
nugs great fireweed um the vintage afghan it's funny it's got a green and a purple pheno and
they're both incredible um the purple phenos got more of that grapey sweeter candy thing
the green phenos got an incredible lime gassy thing going on and um some of my
absolute favorite herb was that vintage afghan so whenever anybody asks me if there was one thing i
could get again i tell them vintage afghan and if they see it pick it up no matter what like
whatever the cost of the vintage afghan is that's some of my favorite herb i've ever smoked so
yeah dave's stuff's incredible i would encourage people to pick up anything you can from him hit
him up directly because that's how he rolls and see what you can get anything that's in his library
though is fire same with jj um jj i've run the three chems the original new york city diesel
and the um the sour african um sour african was by far the raciest sativa i've ever smoked it was
just like white knuckle thrill ride some very very like amped up energetic herb and the uh three chems
and the onycd were you know they're fire um i remember getting those from you jj in 2015
seeing you the next year and uh smoking some of that outdoor with you at the emerald cup and that
was a great experience but yeah i gotta jump off because my phone's gonna die though guys
um it's been an honor and a privilege to be on here with you happy new year everybody and yeah
thank you so much thank you everybody in chat and watching online happy new year dude thanks for
making it thanks trevor yeah yeah of course thanks guys take it easy see you word
yeah awesome guy always very very knowledgeable person i love a lot of talking with trevor
i've been lounging in the background but uh no i have a quick question you had mentioned the
brotherhood and then kind of i remember talking to a guy who was talking about uh you know stuff
coming in through the navy the airbase and can you kind of talk about like where stuff was coming
entering the u or the i guess both coasts kind of back in the day from outside the u.s west the west
coast we got more mexicans because the smuggling route was closer to the west coast whereas east
coast got more of the colombian because that was a lot closer via that route so at parallel times
the west coast has all these mexicans and the east coast has all the colombians and then basically
that's was you know example they the brotherhood just would have kind of friends everywhere one
was like the harbor patrol guy and like by the catalina islands and he was like the harbor chief
or whatever that was in charge of the boats coming in so they would hit him up and say we
have a boat coming in from colombia and they say okay no problem and they would go to like long
beach or santa barbara and load all that stuff like that and then my dad wasn't a smuggler more
of a distributor so they had their houses in like laguna and they were like big houses but meditation
houses with afghan rugs and persian rugs everywhere and everybody was hanging out meditating in zoo
and stuff and you my dad and his buddy would go down there and pick up a bunch of stuff and bring
it back to where they live just like kind of we do and all of us and then distribute it that way
and then they had many different sources as far as the naval thing most likely because
they had were green berets were in part of the brotherhood they had a network that was crazy
and the whole goal right was timothy leary wanted everybody to experience lsd and orange sunshine
the whole way to do that to fund that was to smuggle in all this weed and hash oil and hash
whatever they could sell it pay these scientist guys to make it so everybody could have it free
that was the whole thing of the brotherhood but by 72 73 they all got popped anything after 74
is not like is dudes from the brotherhood that are doing their own thing the brotherhood was
no longer in a group together they all had federal indictments and charges and were scattering all
over the place stuff got real quiet so it was amazing basically like kind of like we're doing
you know you got a dude who makes really good bho and everybody wants it so the network tries to find
that guy and they get it and take it to back to where they came from and then it gets distributed
and however means they get early on it was pretty easy like my dad was telling me and i saw this old
gold movie that one of their buddies was the cop in tijuana and he was a traffic cop and you would
go to him and tell him what you want he would call your brother and send you to a house up on the side
of the road and they had a bunch of weed wrapped in paper and you could buy your kilos right there
and you would have to pay 40 a kilo but if you wanted to go to acapulco it was better it was 30
a kilo but you're going to have to drive all the way down there and bring it back yourself and also
pack it because they're going to get it fresh and then before they get across the border they got to
get presses and pack it all up so they can get it across like in that movie acapulco gold that guy
was really smart he was really good at swimming so he'd go to acapulco buy a bunch pack the vw up
get it to tijuana pack it down tape it up put it in waterproof bags and he would swim from tijuana
to san diego come walk up on the beach with all the weed and put it in the volkswagen van and take
off so as any way to get it here you could lax in the early days they weren't looking for weed so
it was just in your suitcases dudes were shipping big wooden crates would be right on the terminal
where you pull up with your car filled with weed because they weren't hip to it early on but after
all the brotherhood stuff and all that stuff going down and getting busted they became real hip to
smuggling and there was a big crackdown so stuff tapered off kind of like why the hash disappeared
was from the nancy reagan war on drugs so ronald reagan does all these sneaky deals with manuel
noriega to get all those coke in here right and then all the coke goes crazy and he feels guilty
and nancy feels guilty so they go on a war against drugs and start nancy reagan's thing and that cut
off all the hash you know we lost the thai bud because there was no more market during the vietnam
war for people to really buy it so the growers kind of stopped growing it and it tapered off
and that's how our thai disappeared because originally those thai sticks were put in soup
right vietnamese like pho well so do thai people all laos cambodian they all have the soup
and those were sticks put in the flavor of the soup and when the westerners the gis went over
there they started dating the local girls they're cooking them food and these dudes are like wait a
minute that's weed no we can blah blah and vietnamese are real entrepreneurs they notice
there's a market right away so boom they start selling dinky dow right wacky weed the weed you
could buy little packs of cigarettes repacked up with weed in it it became they had all kinds of
ways to buy that weed and it's and then once the war ends there's no more market so there's no more
reason to grow it so it tapers off because that's the other thing in asia a lot of people didn't
smoke weed back then if they did anything they were smoking opium and we didn't do much so why
should we even mess with the weed in the first place the only reason they mess with it because
of the market because of the gis and when the war ends there's no more market and the weed tapers
off that's why we lose our thai weed and it wasn't the americans they i mean in thailand it was legal
until the americans paid them to make it illegal like they did in nepal and afghanistan and
and everywhere else controlled substance right they want to control it it's a monopoly it's a big
gigantic long-term monopoly game yeah but there was thai exports going all the way into the late 80s
that's when it really you know tapered off the last time i saw thai weed yeah 89 we were we were
getting thai sticks in 84 85 um but you had to know someone back then it wasn't like it was
it was in abundance you know those those things were very rare to find but like in the 70s it
was pretty abundant 80s it tapers off right like you're saying 90s it's gone by the 90s you don't
even really get to see thai weed pretty much anymore that's because you know like most of the
time thai weed comes from laos you know i mean now that it's legal now it's it's changed but
you know leading up until now you know the the military and the police pretty much
controlled the smuggling all on all that and yeah he had enough money yours got through
it really the quality came down the priority of it you know they were just trying to get stuff
through and we get paid so you know the you know the real good quality came out of laos
from the research that i've done there's that uh the thai stick book mike ridder
yeah like he's saying it's all grown between laos cambodia and thailand on a certain plateau
in thailand that's where it was all grown on a certain plateau on the laos cambodian border
and they were able to manipulate it right if the last guys are having issues you could go to
cambodia and pay that army to help you smuggle your stuff and then right pretty soon they had
the vietnamese army filling their ships if you had enough money you could pay any level of these guys
to fill these ships up and take them offshore and load your ship up and i'm pretty sure that's how
these guys did it is they utilized the money to help the locals whoever in charge get it off the
coast to your boat so you could get it out of there early days it was individual guys doing
it but as the as the market built and the money came up you're able to buy your way to get it
through now how does that you know how did that actually start did it start you know kind of like
we're talking about okay we know the traffic person who knows the commander who knows that
somebody in the you know the the main deck or was it from the beginning just the government
itself saying we're okay give these people clear passage i think was it an organic growth you start
out little and then when you maybe go to a farm you buy a bunch that guy maybe says hey you want
to talk to these people they'll help you get it through i think it's you'll work your way up type
of thing to where you get to such large amounts that you're going to need those type of people
to help you that would be the only way because but a lot of that started from the gis coming home
you know when they were coming home they were just having their their bags filled with drugs
oh yeah and so you know so really manipulating their way through the chain of command through
the army or paying off their way through because back then you know i'm sure you know you could
have paid for paid for anything back then so it was just a heroin problem came from
is them those gi sending body bags full of heroin back so what but once you get that once you get
that that chain of network set up that supply chain network set up you know you just start
ramping it up after that until you have a problem i think what these guys did is the money from the
weed wasn't enough and since their smuggling was working they figured let's just make it cocaine
and heroin and that dirtied the whole market and i think that's what kind of ruined all the
thai thing too because greed takes over and then when you get into drugs like that they're very
dangerous a lot of bad stuff goes with that stuff right not weed is dangerous at certain levels but
when you get into cocaine and heroin and stuff like that they're they're taking out people like
no not a big deal it's nothing to them higher dollar value and different personality types but
at the same time it's still true today i mean that's one reason concentrates i think are so
popular you can fit a whole lot of concentrate in the size of an ounce of weed you know and that
may have exacerbated it earlier in those days i wasn't there but you know we can fill a bag with
something that's going to net this or net that right it all comes down to the money most of it
when you're once you get past a certain point it's all about the money and greed right you don't
you got enough money you could retire now it's you get a high off it and more you need more
more is not enough you need more and they just get caught up like some of these boats had like
four hundred thousand pounds of tie on it that were getting caught that's incredible four hundred
thousand pounds of weed on one boat and there were hundreds of these boats coming over like wow
that's one thing good about weed is thank god it turns into ash because there's always going to be
needed something to replace it right uh we sure it's like water yeah so was the east coast where
there's some things uh or just kind of methods for getting them in uh that were just as flagrant
because it was under the radar in the early 80s before you know camp on the west coast and just
say no from nancy reagan came into came into effect a little a lot a little bit of that is
you know kind of before my time and you know before you know i would really in the know um
but i do know that like new york city was just kind of like an import hub from around the world
so it was like you know if you had drugs and you can get them to new york city you know you can you
can get you can get your money and but i know you know specifically like we were getting some hash
uh in the late 80s early 90s and um you know and it was coming in on a steady basis you know we
were getting the kilos uh i think a lot of it was pakistani with the gold stamps on them and stuff
some some afghan stuff and then i guess and then all of a sudden it disappeared and then i asked
my friend what happened and you know he said that there was a a big bust on uh i guess on a
cruise liner and that's how they were bringing in a lot of the hash and and it was in the papers and
all and i remember reading about it and you know after that you know it kind of dried up and and so
um yeah yeah so you know new york was just you know like i said you know it was just kind of a
hub and it was like you just had you know a lot of different characters that would just you know
pop up with a bag full of weed or you know lsd or mushrooms and you know it was kind of like
on the spot kind of a deal and you know there were certain places that you could go and like
kind of like try to retail your stuff up in the park or certain bars or or whatever and then you
know once you you know got a you know made a a presence there you would be able to expand
your market off of that and try to move up into the the higher rankings of of you know some of the
you know some of the chain supply chain and you know and that was really a big part of it was like
who you knew you know because you know you know it all came down to you know who who was getting
you know access to the you know the imports and you know and knew the people that were bringing
them in and you know one of the guys that i knew you know he dealt with the italians a lot and so
they controlled the trucking so you know they were they were you know using the trucks and
bringing the mexicans up through arizona and they'd get get get them up into new york and you
know he he would get a phone call you know you know in the middle of the night you know to tell
them to show up at a loading dock at like one or two in the morning you know and he would be there
in there you know and everyone you know has their own group of guys waiting and the truck would back
up you know and then they start off loading this crew would get like a certain amount this crew
would get a different certain amount and and so each crew had their guys there they would take
take their their bricks and they'd be gone and you know that's basically how how they would operate
and so they would just bounce bounce around from warehouse to warehouse and you you wouldn't know
where where to go or you know they would just tell you to show up there and you had to be there if you
wanted to get your load and you'd get 100 200 300 pounds or whatever and you know that would that
would hold you over until the next load came in and so you know they just didn't really know you
know what each load would be different and you know you just knew what you had at the time and
and and that's just the way that it worked and and was a lot of it you know for for both of you
just kind of almost sight unseen not like today where you know you take out the jar you could take
a look at this this was more or less like hey guys bang bang bang let's go i was listening it was like
you you was either take it or leave a thing and you know and for the most part you kind of knew
what you were you were kind of getting and so uh they tried to you know like dave was saying there
was like you know the the really light press you know the the the pillows i used to like to call
is when you'd break up the light press you know we just fill a whole gallon bag
so you know it'd fill it to the brim pretty much you'd have to stuff it in a little bit
it'd be really fluffy and then you had your really tight press you know and you're really
tight press so you really had to kind of rip it apart sometimes stick a screwdriver in the middle
of the rip the rip it apart and you know so there was a big uh price difference and quality difference
between the two were were they just as common uh or was it usually one more than the other
oh well well it really depended on you know what you know most of us really wanted the better ones
you know and so you know um and even i remember they'd even have some upper ones
and you know most of the time it would depending on you know how much seeds was in it and you know
if it was really green and sticky and you know there there was a you know there was like a
price uh a quality uh difference and stuff so it would be priced accordingly and you know and
you know when you smoked it you would be able to tell the difference you know like
and i remember getting some really good um you know high quality mexican back in the day that
was almost like afghani like and um you know that was much you know it would be
you know much you know more like you know maybe like four or five hundred dollars more a pound
than your regular kind of commercial uh stuff that you would your commercial green
fluffy green what you know you know not not the flat press so you know but that stuff wasn't as
common like you know if that stuff came around you kind of had to grab it and it was always a you
know a definitely a higher higher grade quality but um like i said before like a lot of that stuff
was just you know there at the moment and um you know pretty much like the the the common green
fluffy stuff you know that that was pretty much a staple but you know it would be uh the quality
would would would vary at vary at times but you know um it wouldn't be brown or anything like
that so you know there was kind of an uh an understanding of upper mids as we would call
them i guess you would call them upper mids and compared to your your regular mids which would be
you know your real lower grade commercial type uh tighter press brown or more seeds and uh lower
quality you know we can't you didn't chat i'm sorry dave thank you uh was anything coming to
you guys that was like popular properly cured was that even in the equation back then most of the
stuff was that i used to get i mean uh i mean some of the really some of the indoor you know stuff
there some of the early indoor you you might not have got gotten some cured stuff i mean because
you know that stuff was just so was just so rare that you know people would just send it out i mean
totally sopping wet and you know you know you could get away with it back then because you know
you were lucky to even get that so uh you know so yeah you just had to roll with what you were able
to get at the time and it weighed more oh yeah i mean i mean you would have to yeah you'd have to
literally let it sit out and dry it out yourself and then you'd have to calculate what you paid
you know for and then what you actually got at the end and a lot of the um the early um hazes
from florida used to come up pretty wet and stuff and so um yeah and they would be like really
chemmed out not flushed and you know i mean i mean back then you know it was what it was it was just
uh you were you're lucky to get anything like that and most of the people i don't even really
know if they really had the knowledge you know you know of uh you know of you know like what
they're doing today of flushing and the concept of all that stuff so you know even i remember some
very crude uh the very first bho that i ever saw you know back in the day and this was like in
in the mid to late 90s or probably toward the late 90s but you know they were calling it hash oil but
it was it was just not it was not purged at all and so people were just smoking like this butane
uh contaminated uh oil and i remember smoking some myself and it was just that you know that
rustiness that i don't know what you want to call it of the butane and um you know later they
refined that process but you know early on there was just a lot of experimentation and just a lot
of non-ethical stuff that you used to be able to get away with just because of the supply and demand
factor you know if there's not if there's a big demand for anything that you can get you know and
just like dave was saying you know with you know with a drought and stuff and like you would you
know you would travel anywhere you thought you could be had a chance of getting some weed so
how many people today have smoked resin from their pipe scraped your pipe and smoke resin right
you're old school if you smoke and resin from your pipe yeah well that just shows you how
desperate you were that just shows you what a dry season is oh well said yeah i mean right you got in
the little threads you got all the little threads cleaned out and boy or you put the put the bowl
in the middle chamber of your proto pipe and then get that resin that was yeah the little pipe that
had the little chamber you put your nug in there yeah i never had a nug to put in there i'm smoking
that stuff man i never i was always blown away at people had all these jars of weed i was like how
the hell do you do that i can't keep weed it's gone gone as soon as you get it we smoke it it's
gone and then like damn how do we get more i think like you were saying time era was i think
west coast is a little different and me being older and my dad being into this i kind of realize
now why i was at all these places because when you have a kid in a car it's less likely that
the cops are going to pull you over so my dad would take me to all the places that he would
load up and all the weed and there were always houses so that was interesting too is my mom's
my mom's brother is considerably younger than my mom and dad he grew up in redondo beach hermosa
during i.e when they that era for the blow movie he was one of the main weed guys he was dating
all the psa stewardess that were smiling in the weed on the planes so they literally did have
bedrooms full of weed stacked up so i'd be you know go over these houses in hermosa or wherever
torrent redondo beach richie's house my uncle day's whatever and i'll walk in with my dad i'm
a little dude and tons of weed tons the whole house but they lived there it wasn't like a
trap house or they just kept it there no these are they lived in these houses so they'd have
a warehouse where they'd bring it from the warehouse to the houses and a bedroom would be
filled stacked up with weed and people would come by and grab the weed and leave and i've seen like
i remember seeing like a square yard of weed brick is sitting in the middle of her living room
one day and i was like wow because i was little so that thing was almost up to my sternum or
whatever it's like what is this huge massive pile of weed just sitting there yeah so they're always
remember houses and then for my time too someone would get the weed they'd tell you on the phone
oh this one's killer or it's like the last one or no this one's amazing and try to describe it as
best you could you would go with your money and just try to freestyle it when you saw it you saw
it however good it was you either grabbed it all or you didn't buy as much and sometimes you had
choices usually with the imported stuff mexicans you had several choices but when it was west coast
outdoor grown green type bud it was usually a certain type right because the older guys i knew
when i was in high school were going to humboldt state so we were lucky they were bringing honeydew
back and all what was ever big at that time they'd bring him back five six seven peas and then we were
buying our ounces and quarter peas or whatnot like that at their house so that's how that went
imagine new york's different because everything's so tight that's why the delivery services thrived
that would never work in west coast la no way because everybody has their own car and everything
is so separated that that wouldn't be possible unless you're in downtown yeah but also california
i think was more of an epicenter because of the locale and closeness to mexico and then having
your own growing climate and everything so you're kind of like your own producer in a such where
new york was just kind of an import city and so you just you had similar but a shorter season i
think because you have to remember southern california no one could really grow weed everybody's
close together there's no wilderness areas back then indoor wasn't really heard of so anything
that was really good either came from temecula they called it southern humboldt the temecula area
or it came from norcal probably from san luis obispo sometimes santa barbara you get some stuff
but mostly san luis obispo and up was the source of all the type of green weed well she you know
santa cruz you know you had the big sir holy weed and yeah but i'm just saying uh as far as
southern california we would be like new york where we didn't produce a lot in southern california we
were mostly getting imports from around the state because say in la you couldn't in 1980 i worked at
a i've been in photography forever i worked at a photo lab one time and someone brought in their
pictures and they had an outdoor grow and the goddamn photo lab called the cops and busted them
that's how gnarly it was so any and i'm a photographer i learned right away if you shoot
slide film a machine does it and they can't see the pictures but i knew right away anywhere in
southern california if you took a picture of something illegal whoever developed that was
going to call the police on you so it was very dangerous to grow weed in southern california
it didn't happen until late 90s or so when people learned how to tap and weed value was high
that they went crazy but before then it's kind of unheard of not many people grew very rarely
so southern california was mostly getting the weed from mexico or san diego or the desert or
santa barbara norcal we were like right we had the music the movie industry there's lots of money
just like new york wherever money is the good best quality gravitates there for the high dollar value
so in if you're in la or hollywood or new york you're gonna have the best weed from around the
united states gravitate to those areas and if your network and your dollar value let you you can
participate in those weeds or if you're a cool like if you're a pro athlete or a musician god whatever
if you have something that it gets you in the door to be able to get that weed so i remember
before og and bubba i was known as lemon dave because i had the gnarliest lemon weed anybody's
ever tried so b real and paris hilton and snoop dog and black eyed peas everybody was after my
weed so i was like cool guy lemon dave whoa this shit's really unique it's only coming from one
place they were paying six seven thousand dollars a pound i didn't get that much but by the time i
sold it to this one guy and them because he knew them it's six to seven a pound and then within six
months to a year bubba shows up and lemon's not a cool anymore and then about two or three months
after the bubba shows up og is everywhere and now og is the king and og remained the king forever
until cookie showed up and that knocked og off the pedestal for a while it was really expensive
because it slow veg low yield it was good weed so it got the price of ogs around the six thousand
and then you had the alien line show up that wasn't too uh uh
um then what gorilla glue that you know messed with some people on the pedestal for a while
then you had your strawberry tangies and all that show up and that wasn't so much for flower as more
so concentrates because flower wise it didn't get you high at all but in a concentrate it tastes
amazing and got you high and that's when the bho was taking off so those kind of played in hand in
hand we had a big surge with tangy strawberry bananas craziness right that went crazy for a
while and then we got the skittles thing for a while now we've been cookies purple stuff anything
purple indica right now where i see us phasing you don't have to have all purple now now they
want candy gas anything super candy or candy gas is where la's market is right now i don't know
about the rest of the united states but that's la market and unless you have candy gas you are not
selling your weed at all if you got outdoor you are not selling your weed it's got to be the best
grown candy grass indoor weed in order to sell your weed and get good money for in la
it's pretty crazy the competition's tough the competition is tough i feel covid screwed us up
a lot too because we used to have events and the events brought people from around the united states
that got to put their face in a jar and experience really good weed without that they all whoever's
the most popular dude on instagram oh this guy must know what he's talking about he's got a
million followers oh he likes gary payton and jealousy it's got to be the best weed in the world
so we want that and that momentum has started because as soon as these people that want that
weed experience the other weed they go oh my god what have i been doing this stuff actually gets me
high i think prop 64 also affected that a lot because pre-prop 64 was when you could stick
your nose in the jars and go to events and have it out it's a complex cookie right a lot of
ingredients make the cookie where we're at now but at least at like you know emerald cup everybody
bode had his socks i had my sacks in the backpack and you can go out in the back or somewhere's booth
and stick a jar in someone's nose you could still do it we don't have that now it's it's really
gone to crap because everything hate to say this is based on instagram you realize if instagram
kicked off weed the whole weed market would crash everything is relying on instagram it is whether
we want to admit it or not it sucks and then it's become not to how good the weed is as who the
person is it's can i get likes or follows how much attention can i draw from this cannabis that's
where we're at right now you know and if it takes finding someone's little weakness and mistake and
they all gravitate to prey on the weakness to draw attention to themselves because that's how
they have nowadays i mean like i've never seen weed pages everybody had weed now you see weed
pages just memes when you're complaining about a guy breeding or how he grows this weed or what
this is when your whole page is memes where what have we what what does this become if i instagram
itself and just think about it what is it you're doing this you're scrolling you're scrolling
and then all of a sudden you see something that's eye candy and it catches your eye and you stop and
you look at it and you might give it a like or you might make a comment on it you know and it's the
same thing with these mylar bags now now now everything is is marketed on these mylar bags
oh it's got this you know a cartoon character on it or whatever you know so the weed must be good
it's you know and it's the same thing when you're driving down the highway and you see a billboard
with a sexy girl so it's going to catch your eye you're going to take a look at it so a lot of it
is really based off of marketing and then and so when you're doing the marketing you know who are
you marketing to you know a lot of this are marketing towards you know younger kids and
inexperienced smokers because because that's where you're going to that's where the most that's where
the most of the uh you know especially with legalization you know this is where the the uh
majority of your new smokers are coming from is younger people because that's where the majority
of people you know young young people are isn't older people like us that are just fading out
you know out of the majority that are kind of considered leftovers so really the market is
really kind of dictated by by the younger kids and crowd and so and that's why he's
he who has the most followers must know about weed because he has a lot of followers right but
that's why cookies is so successful because you got you know uh uh a b a b right rated rapper
that's got an underground you know weed following and kind of like you said you know once you get
that momentum and that notoriety going for you you kind of just build off of it and that's what
cookies are they're master marketers you know you can't you can't hate them for that you know the
weed itself doesn't you know doesn't you know um has no merit or i wouldn't say no merit no real
substance to it no but you know but if you're a young inexperienced smoker and you don't know the
genetic pool of what's really out there then you think that stuff is cool so you know let me phrase
just think in cookies instead of burner had jj now the influence that cookies have would be a lot
more knowledgeable than what we're dealing with with burner and that's the problem is the role
models don't have the proper knowledge for the new young people that are going to take our place
and we need to somehow educate the younger people that are going to take our place so when we're
gone they're there to tell the next generation of young people but our educators are not educators
they're what do they call the whatever when they get their influencers right it's more about
how much effect do you have on the public more so than the product you're representing
and for those guys that's an investment group jj if we had that much money backing us to
holy crap we'd be pissing on every hydrant making friends with every dude selling a dream
grabbing all their genetics climbing on some ours and putting them under our label because that's
the budget they have they can buy their way into anything they have no shame in their game and
they're buying legacy and like you said you can't blame them because that's marketing everybody's
into this for a different reason those people are into making money and that's a proven system that
makes money for any business and i don't hate them or just i mean i don't care for them but i
don't dislike them and hate them that's their thing that's their lane what i do is my lane what
i do doesn't affect them and what they do doesn't affect me the only thing is i my complaint is they
have so much influence on the market i wish they would gain more proper knowledge and push that
through to their people instead of putting tours and budweiser down their throat yeah but also they have
so much influence that they try to keep the small legacy people like like ourselves out of the game
where they don't want us to be able to compete because they know that we have a better product
than that and so you know so there will you know they kind of just dumb down the whole the whole
market is this going to be kind of dumb down the commercial market i feel because you're not letting
craft get into the game you're just going to try to steal their genetics or or they don't know what
craft is even if it was right in front of their face they don't have the experience to know what
it is that's the thing is burner needs to gain experience burner needs to try other weeds burner
needs to listen to some dude who may have experience but doesn't have 100 million followers
with gold chains and look cool or everybody doesn't like them right like you know mike from coastal
where all these guys have immense knowledge that they could be sharing with burner because not
everybody is born with need knowledge right we have to get it somewhere well that's why that's
why i picked up bode you know and if burners in that position the best we can do is we're not
going to get rid of him would be to help educate him so the information he puts out does a positive
thing whether it helps their company or not i just think it's the right thing to do it's integrity
and like i say with no events all we have is the internet and basically on the internet all you have
is instagram and instagram right now is based on how many likes and followers can i get sadly
it's funny you need to come to one of the la i i do a weekly la event and exactly what we're
talking about is is kind of my like as i sit there smoking all the the dessert and fruity weeds that
are rolled for me uh and it's all like packaging and then actually when you were talking about i
was thinking i was like fuck like my packaging is like plain brown coin envelopes with me right
i was like i need my packaging game you don't grow packaging though that's what counts
you know like all these dudes talk shit about jj seeds or my seeds well dudes you've never grown
our genetics why are you talking shit about our shit when you've never grown it like there's five
guys that are just pain in my butt they hate me with all their life but they've never bought my
seeds or groom why do you hate me so bad and why do they keep following you that's what i don't
understand it's like if you hate me go away uh so here's the thing a lot of breeders think i'm a
kind of a dickhead because my attitude is out of sight out of mind what they this is a poker game
at this point i'm not going to show people my hand so i don't add breeders to my instagram that's why
my profile profile is private every single person there is hand-picked i don't just add people
right it's quality over quantity this is now a poker game i don't want you to see what i'm working
with and i don't want to see what you're working with because i will probably make wrong assumptions
and say something stupid and have to eat crow and put my foot in my mouth and at the same time i
don't want you looking at my stuff and see what i'm doing right so now i don't know what you're
doing it keeps me from saying something stupid and two if you don't know what i'm doing then it
keeps you from copying me and two i can't get mad at you if you happen to be working with the same
genetics how would you know you can't see what i'm doing but when we both see our thing then
when i'm always like i'm the only one working with sage why all of a sudden so many all these dudes
got sage so i'm moved to something else and i'm like fuck i'm trying to work with something else
and no one's working with but all of a sudden everybody's working with hogs breath what the
fuck is going on sorry is this a quinky dink or are people peeking at each other's hands
i see i don't get involved with that anymore you know i guess
and it's out of sight out of mind i have no problems yeah but people you know people don't
really care anymore you know if people are gonna you know uh support known rats and and everything
i mean you know back in the forum days it used to really mean something kind of like what you were
saying before you know but you know and i used to i used to fight that fight harder than anyone
in the world yeah i've seen them now and now you know i've learned that it's just it's just a losing
you're just wasting your time really you just really got to focus on what you want to do i mean
i like to keep tabs on like what other people are doing you know but i don't particularly will chime
in you know i see a lot of people like you know like yesterday i saw some guy saying he wants to
take the star dog guava and fema into the star dog quarry you know and it's like yeah i could have
chimed in and said something and started this whole big thing but you know what i just kept doing this
and just and and just scrolled right on past it you know um yeah i mean it's just not worth you
know don't you know fighting that fight anymore because uh especially a lot of with a lot of the
new jack kids that come in you know that you know like you were saying before you know there's no
more risk anymore you know i mean i mean back in the day i mean there was a risk of actually
shipping seeds like if you had you know shipped some seeds that got caught up in the mail and
they traced that back to you elite genetics is a good example you would have you would have found
yourself into some big trouble yeah but i think that case i think involves a credit card with a
underage some underage kid buying using a parent's credit card or something like that
you could get in trouble for even sending seeds nowadays it's no big deal right you know
so but the other thing about some of these arguments is i will get an argument back and
forth with people because i don't try to tell lies what i feel that i express is true and if
it's not i'll correct myself and two people learn from these arguments when this dude says oh like
a seed stole my haze photo and reposted my same photo and we're trying to sell the hay seeds like
they had it and grew it so now we got little golden coast has to go up against a seeds you
know that's not going to work out too well for me because they're extremely popular worldwide
but at the same time i'm not going to let these dudes literally take the picture off my page
and say they have those genetics and sell them one you're stealing my image two you're lying to
people ripping them off so i called them out i copied the photo and said dude you're stealing
why are you doing this how like really the picture's on my page everybody can see it
right i go how long did it take the flower how long did you veg it for what type of phenos they
couldn't answer it and i had to argue with so many dudes that you don't know what you're talking
about oh that's a seed blah blah blah blah blah and you gotta get in the back and forth and by
doing that people read that and learn oh so that's what really happened so i hate these arguments and
some of them suck like one breeder stole myself and blatantly lied to the whole community didn't
so i had to bring up the text message to him narcing on himself to someone else and no one
would ever believe me unless i brought that up and gotten a back and forth so some of these back and
forth the community learns what what this is all about why this argument happened strain origins
who had at first who was doing this why did i guess this guy say that there's a lot of stuff
like that going on so sometimes i feel like in some of these arguments people are watching these
arguments and they think it's stupid but they're actually learning part of our weed history that's
what's gone on in the last one two five ten fifteen twenty years right because a lot of people are in
the spotlight and are way up on a high pedestal for not doing anything all on a false image they've
put out and right i'm not going to go call them out but when you come to me and get in an argument
back and forth with me don't think i'm going to pull that on on you because i'm not making up
anything it's true and i didn't come to you to start a fight but now you came into my area and
you're poking me in the butt well then let's go that's i call it mind checkers okay if you want
to play mind checkers let's go because there's proof in my pudding right and i won't get in a
fight where if i think i have to lie to make myself right i just won't even go there but
dudes like i purposely avoid them oh that guy's fake his dad was never in the brotherhood they're
full of crap some very popular people oh that guy's full of shit i don't go call them out and
say oh you're wrong you're wrong but when they come into my page and talk crap then i'll pull
them out right you know what i mean oh you said this but how come this and where's your proof
that the proof that i have isn't true you know that kind of thing so some of i don't like arguments
but sometimes i think you have to do it i'm not gonna pick you gotta pick your fights in your
spots and connor you know with the acing i kind of i kind of get it you were you know you had you
know you had the proof on them and stuff but like you know when someone starts knocking off some of
my seed seed lines or whatever anymore it's just really not worth getting into an argument saying
why are you you know you know or putting them on blast or anything like that it just it just
doesn't work anymore you know because you know you got all these new kids that they just want
to get into the weed weed game or be a breeder or whatever for whatever reason and that's the reason
why they're getting into it when i started i didn't get it into it to be a breeder i got into
it for my own self-preservation and it just kind of grew from there you know where today people are
getting into it to be a breeder to be a part of you know the industry or you know and there's you
know so many different you know facets and angles that you can you can do and so most people just
want to just take the easiest route and just take something that's that's been successful
within this by somebody else and just and just work off of that you know and so i mean you got
guys that take your genetics for me look like a guy like copycat copycat is it's his name his name
says it all off a copy and off other people's genetics and you say what you want but the guy
sells seeds you know and that's the bottom line a guy like rez dog a known a known rat in the
community still gets support still sells seeds so this is really the the mentality that you're
fighting against and yeah you can educate a certain amount of people that want to be educated
but there are people out there that just don't really care i agree with that but at the same time
out of 10 people two of them may care no i understand i never got into the argument at
least those two people would have never known example the guys in hawaii take my genetics
say screw the guy they re they feminize it keep the same name and sell it under the same name and
tell me too bad what are you going to do about it of course i'm going to go in a back and forth
like one just because you feminize it doesn't make it different it's the same thing two which
is wrong you kept the same name that's a double no no right like how can you that's like me taking
your star dog feminizing it and still selling it a star dog and people what's the people do that
all the time that's what i'm saying is that right is that okay it's not right you know i mean but
if you see if your kid steals from the store all the time or your friend's kid you're just
going to keep letting them or sometime maybe say it's probably not cool that many people out there
that you can't you can't run and track them all down and even if you did it's like you're not
going to do anything to change you the only thing you could try to do is yeah you could try to
educate the people so they won't buy those seeds but you got to realize who your customers are
my customers are not going to buy those seeds okay you know if if you're going to get a low
brow customer more than likely he's not going to buy my seeds because they're too expensive
he's going to buy a knockoff package or 50 or whatever so you know you know you got to reach
the realization that you know you you're not going to reach everyone and you just concentrate on the
people that you can reach and and and work off of that you know because those other people they're
not your customer and you know they don't really care they're just going to do most of it most of
it's based around money so whatever is cheapest and they can try to get a knockoff strain for the
you know instead of paying full price and get it cheaper that's what people will do and you know
it depends on you know for me i'm the kind of person i would rather pay more money and get it
from the source you know i mean so it you know you know it depends on like what kind of a connoisseur
you are you want to be you know the low brow guy or you want to get it be the guy that's getting
them off from the source so you know that based on their knowledge and they only know what they know
example the argument with the hawaii guys a lot of people came up to me and said bro i had no
idea that was your stuff i'm glad you've gotten that argument or else i would have never known
so it's a damned if you do damned if you don't if you don't get into it then you have a lot of
people that don't know if you get into it you got a lot of people that dislike it but at least you're
educating some people to where they know right it's a and that's why i say i don't go after
everyone but certain ones i will get in a back and forth with because it lets me piss on the
hydrant that's mine and it also lets like you know maybe two out of the 10 people are going
to learn something and it's better that two people learn than nobody's learning yeah and that's all
i say is sometimes i will get in back and forth with people and it's only a handful rarely and
a lot of the arguments i get into is sticking up for other guys and i don't mind that i'm a big boy
i know what i'm doing you know and if some dudes fucking with one somebody that's my friend or
their their livelihood i'm gonna say something because when i was growing up they had this thing
called being put in check and you learn from it when you're with all your buddies and you did
something stupid and your one cool buddy says what are you doing fool that's stupid and you go
ah i get it you gotta put in check and you learn from it yeah i know but you know a lot of times
a lot of times you're arguing with a guy that's got like you know 50 followers and like you know
two posts and so it's like you know you got to pick and choose your battles you know when
i do that's the point i kind of wanted to try to get to too because you know a lot of these people
you do have to pick your battles but you guys both mentioned in marketing there are some people
whose entire like business strategy is based on getting in these types of conversations
because they will build the name the name will get out there and in a month everybody forgot
what it was but they still remember the name oh i think i heard of that guy yep their entire model
so you you know you're both right but you do have to be careful of which ones you get into because
there are so many of them by name on this show because i'm not gonna do it either right that
helps their whole process and if we've been around long enough you know who the bottom feeders are i
call them bottom feeders we're the game fish these are the carp and the catfish eating all our shit
because that's all they got and their bad attitudes and their bad breeding process
or string collecting whatever it may be is always going to keep them on the bottom
they don't know how to besides the weed thing they don't know how to treat humans as a human
so they'll never leave the bottom and it's you know that sees jj knew we all know who they are
we don't have to mention names there's about five to ten of them that you heal throughout the year
just causing unnecessary problems for people because they got no game for themselves that's
the only game they have is by attacking other people like you said it keeps their name relative
right that's the whole thing that's why i said some of these weed people don't even have weed
on their page no more it's just memes because their weed wasn't good enough to keep them
relative and the only thing that keeps them relative is making memes about somebody else's
problem although i do like trevor's meme forever makes good memes whatever is knowledge
it's not trying to belittle somebody yeah he could flex all his cannabis knowledge schooling
there's education there but he doesn't need to post weed and grows weed so who cares i'm talking
about these dudes who claim to be these weed growers their whole page is just memes making
personal fun of people personally right like see how fat that guy is or how retarded or whatever
it's personal shit you know it's silly so so the conversation you guys were having before is kind
of that's another example like you guys both understand each other's perspectives you kind
of approach it differently and there's kind of a spectrum of you know like some breeders would say
if you buy my seeds do whatever you want with them like you bought them they're yours um i think
other people who are like yeah use my stuff but if if you're going to use it at least like reference
the lineage correctly uh and then like yeah you're totally right well obviously it helps if you put
the name there it helps me being able to continue what i'm doing and i learned from jj and all the
guys on thc forums and all that stuff and you never copy another breeders work or use the same
names you can outcross all you want is fine i'm smart enough to know i sell regular seeds they're
gonna get a mail and do crosses cool just don't cross my genetics to my genetics right like if
we're djs why would you come up after me and basically play the same songs i play just in a
different order do you think the crowd wants to hear that when there's 5 000 songs you could be
playing so that's my argument is don't copy my stuff and please always give credit i ask i would
hope you give credit but no you can breed all you want but my stuff just don't cross it to each other
and that was the first thing i asked dj short when i first met him i said if i started breeding
what's the most important thing i should know he said there's two things always kill the strains
what they are and give credit and people are going to only remember the bad and never the good
your reputation is everything and ever since he told me that in 2009 i've lived by that my
reputation is everything and always give credit to whatever you're working with regardless
so those have kind of been my my gold models is your rep is everything they're only going to
remember the bad not the good and call everything what it is because that's what you would want
people to do with your stuff right and i i think that was great advice he gave me and it's true
right people only remember the bad uh these seeds didn't germy or these ones hermit or this and that
you know you hear more of that than you do the good stuff the the vocal minority there the vocal
minority yeah i i agree with that 100 i mean the integrity it takes one thing to destroy your
reputation and uh you know even on the seed bank side like if someone's ever like i bought some
stuff and it didn't germinate i'm like another packs on the way the next time i'm at the post
office like no quite if it's like the fourth time i'm just like good god like it could be user error
it could be that they're you know you know just the the germination rates on like are low i mean
if i start to hear from multiple people but if it's like one dude over and i'll still i'll keep
sending packs i'm just like please god let him have success with the next one or or i'll just
refund right uh i just look at the followers if it's under 200 followers they i know they made
the mistake they got a lot of followers they know what they're doing it's probably my mistake no
but the customer is always right making a joke yeah and i know like you know a lot of these
people too you know that kind of troll people and they're just in the business of trying to
find something that you did you know like try to dig up some dirt or expose you in some way that
you misled your customers or the public or you know you know i i get that all the time it's like
you constantly have a target on your back and you know and it's the internet so everything you say
you know it you know lasts forever you know so you know you know when you're giving out information
and everything you know you know if you're on the up and up you you know that you know you have
nothing to worry about nobody has anything on you you know you're not lying you're being truthful
to your to your knowledge and and sometimes the knowledge that we know changes you know and and
and that's you know the history of cannabis because we are you know it's really a an oral history
in sort of a sense and you know we only go by with with what we were told and what we believe until
you know some new evidence shows something different or someone pops up with a different
story that's credible or or whatever and then that and then that history kind of changes or whatever
and and and so you know some of these people just you know go go around trying to you know try to
try to expose you or you know try to be like some kind of like you know weed detective and you know
that's kind of like you know uh i don't you know i don't want to mention any names but some other
people you know they just go around doing that and you know sometimes you know they they hit the nail
on their head and then and then sometimes they're just they're just way off base so you know you
know you know if you're gonna go around you know um throwing accusations around people or or whatever
you know you know you better have some proof to the uh to the back yourself up you know you gotta
have that that's what makes trevor so amazing because he he is a weed detective and he'll like
he'll start pulling stuff from like like court proceedings you're like holy shit like i never
want to be in trevor's crosshairs right where i have i have people targeting me because some guy
made a post saying i was a rat or i did this or i did that and you know that's their that's their
reference of information you know and it's just hearsay and you know a lot of people just like to
pile on and you know and try to you know everyone likes a train wreck you know they like to build
you up and then i like to tear you down just as fast so you know if you if you conduct yourself
you know uh in the right way you know with transparency you know no one will ever have
anything on you and so you know you know that's why you know a lot of these people i just i mean
i used to fight back and forth with them and now i just block them it's just really you know you're
you know if you really think about it you're fighting with who are you fighting with you're
fighting with an entity on the internet you know it's just like it's just like could be this
just made up person right so to speak with no credentials or or anything once i get in
arguing with i i personally know him like like dave you were saying earlier too though it's about
the long play and ultimately in the long play ethics and integrity are really what shine through
and a lot of these people who may be entering the market or you know the just the instagram
number one fans you know they're up and down there they'll be here today maybe here for next
year and then they'll be gone tomorrow but if you have the long play those people are the ones that
are going to stick around and will probably try to actually educate themselves to well that's the
thing is forgive them lord lo they know not what they do right but a lot of these people you don't
even see them like a lot of i mean a lot of us have met in person you know i've met at different
shows you know uh you know you know but you know a lot of these people that's what i'm saying like
these are this kind of entities on the internet that you will never meet will never show their
face will just always be out there giving in giving their opinion how you suck or or or or
whatever and and that's because they have nothing else going on for themselves and they're just i
don't know if it's a jealousy thing or you know and just like dave said like most of these people
they're going on what they might be going on someone else's opinion on on on you and they've
never even grown out your gear or anything so they you know a lot of it is kind of like a popularity
contest in high school almost then um you know you got to really do your research and you know
you know and you will you'll find out you know who the real people are in the industry and then
and then you know who the people are who the posers are actually just just quickly a clarification on
what i was uh talking about before because the disbanded brotherhood uh was one of those people
who i assume uh uh i sent packs to that didn't germinate and then like i sent more it would be a
third time what the end of that story was to me the the best breeders and this i actually i don't i
actually like i don't like when that happens but i send new packs i also let the breeder know hey
like an fyi something of yours didn't germinate i sent another pack out no questions asked
i love when i hear back from the breeder of course like you know send anything from my whole lineup
like they want to make it right too uh that kind of shows me what the breeder is all about which i
like when when that validation happens right but what's a pack of seeds gonna cost you like you
know to read to replace them okay and then what's the cost of a of an unhappy customer because you
know a lot of my customers are repeat customers so number one you're going to lose them as a customer
and then number two they're not going to have anything good to say about you or not going to
give you any good referrals so it's kind of a lose lose situation i mean if you if you balance out
you know a pack of seeds that's going to cost me how much compared to losing sales and and
and customers i mean it's a no-brainer for me i never had that problem because i don't say this
but when people buy seeds i just throw in extra packs and i imagine if any of my stuff didn't
germinate they're so stoked they got extra packs or something they don't say anything
my thing is uh i've lost seeds sending them to the guy person who purchases them they got lost
and that's pretty painful because some of these orders have been huge and it's like stuck because
they international orders that get seized at uh customs yeah well i wouldn't even do it some of
it's my fault i write the wrong address so one example was dude sent me the thing i look at the
envelope got the address write it down send it and then he says well didn't you look inside i put a
different address i said oh damn so i just send them the same seeds for no cost because it was
my mistake sometimes there was one thing where the money got lost i know he wasn't pulling funny
business so he actually did send the money but what i do send him that value in seeds so i get
nothing but he actually gets seeds that's the tricky one so i sent him a little more than half
his order right he spent a certain amount got less than he was expected but i got nothing and
had to send out seeds so that's a tricky one as far as germination goes i breed weed for myself
so everything i breed i'm growing so i know if my seeds don't germinate i didn't even sell those
seeds i know the seeds germinate so when somebody says hey those seeds didn't germinate i kind of
get an idea possibly of what might be going i'll ask them questions what they do blah blah blah oh
i put it in fox farms or i hit it with newts right that'll kill your seeds you can't fertilize seeds
stuff like that i get it but when some did say oh the seeds were light none of them germinated
one i don't sell light seeds and it's impossible i always put extra seeds in the pack so you mean
out of the 13 14 15 seeds in there not one worked that's where i'll call bullshit on the goods
and maybe i'll give them a pack or maybe i told them too bad i don't care that's my maybe my
shitty customer service but let's say this is where you and i differ on our approaches well
it's just based on my experience from being in this for a long time yeah i used to be like that
too but you're only hurting yourself when you do that well i feel out the dude and luckily the
couple dudes that pulled i was right they were pulling funny business so knock on wood i've
gotten lucky but most of the times i never had a germination problem it's losing the seeds and i
usually just send it to them and that's that's the one thing was when they send the money and
gets lost that's the sketchy one because did they make a mistake did they really send the money
there's all kinds i've had funny business like that yeah well maybe they got to have tracking
on that show at least that they prove proof of that they sent some something you know there's a
lot of you know we had one dude sticking a bunch of poster receipts and then kind of purposely ripped
the bag itself and sent it with no money these receipts in there saying no there was money in
there i said are you sure he goes yeah the post office must have or stole the money i said what
do you mean the post office must have stole the money well they had to i sent the money
and i said well how come the label on the package is over the cut in the package right so the
package had the cut and then they put the shipping label over it so if the post office got in there
there's no way that cut would have been under the label so the dude got caught trying to pull funny
business yeah there's all kinds of funny guys that's just the way it is right because any
business someone's going to try to pull something funny i don't care if it's a veterinarian or
wherever it is 7-eleven someone's going to pull some try to pull some funny business
no difference in the weed world and the crux of the problem too is that this industry even
though it does you know have its structure has its taxes has its privileges uh we don't have the
same rights to do things like credit card payments en masse or you know simple things that would
eliminate all of these problems so that's the damned if we do damned if we don't because if
we go back 20 years ago when things are super illegal holy crap right we probably wouldn't be
doing this because we'd be scared to death of it cashier's checks seem to work then right well
yeah but you got to use your driver's license to cash it right so there is always a little
trail to these things if they want to play some kind of funny biz but i think we're at the point
now where before they would arrest you for the substance that's in there now they don't care so
much about that is how much is the value and what taxes are you not paying and when you get to a
certain point of not paying taxes that's where they're going to get you they don't give a shit
what's in these packages no more unless it's like you know a large amount of a highly illegal
substance but weed wise the stuff i'm hearing being sent around like stuff to london massive
amounts i don't think they really care too much where they're going to go is watch you do it for a
couple years and watch you because the feds can do that they'll build their case and they'll go
after tax things on you they'll go that way to seize assets because the whole thing for them
to bust you is for a statistic and assets and if they don't get a positive statistic or assets out
of it it's not worth the bust right every case there is it's all about a conviction statistic
or how much assets can we get because when you're little enough your conviction statistic is not big
enough and the assets you don't own a house you don't own a car they don't want to mess with you
but as soon as you have stuff in your name now they're going to make their move and it's always
been like that right it's always like that they want assets and statistics because the statistics
get them their funding also right the convictions the bus all that gets the funding from the
government all the shit that convict is more money in their little piggy bank so they can buy all new
cars and toys and army shit for their police station that's what all that shit's about
well that kind of that almost like brings me 180 to a question we were talking about earlier you
were talking about the square yard of weed in these houses and just the massive quantities of it
how did you guys what did you do about the smell did things like move that fast like were they in
and out that fast it was on the era because in the old days the weed didn't smell like it did
okay it didn't happen until the indicas right everybody wants roadkill skunk that's not a
bread strain that's an afghani probably grown under a certain environment in a certain soil
and is expressing itself out in the area it smelled like roadkill but the closer you got
it didn't smell like you smelled more coffee it had more of like a acrid burnt coffee smell real
close but if you whiff it in the air it's full roadkill and i think it's weird how it disappeared
because i think the genetics are here we can smell skunk and ogs and the chem line they're just
masked by all the other terpenes and i think what it was is before medical that weed was grown
outdoors in native soil in natural light there wasn't all kinds of amendments and all this stuff
they're putting in and in these raised beds and 400 gallon smart pots with all this clover cover
and stuff it was in that natural soil with the natural light and i think it brought more of that
expression out of the roadkill we want because if you notice the timeline the roadkill disappears
as medical starts when everybody can now start making their own food and do things differently
there's kind of you can see that transition i think dj short said the same thing he thinks
it's just an afghani grown outdoors under old type environments it made that expression come out more
yeah i could definitely see that we you know we talk about different fertilizers and you know a
lot of things that can change the expression of it i almost want to say it's miracle grow and eagle 20
that made it special miracle grow made weed tastes like the d that chloriney bleachy kind of
pool cleaner that kind of chest cold chemical taste that the d has that's what the miracle
grow used to do because we had to try that too and if you use too much it makes little black dots
and when you light it they'd spark like the flint on your lighter spectacular little sparks
because the the the minerals were leeching out of the plant and they were concentrating there
was so much of them but yeah it had a real chlorine bleachy like the old hash plant that
typical hash plant i'm sure you've tasted it in the day it's a real chlorine bleach taste almost
like you're like this weed's moldy but you're like no it's not that's just the profile not
a nitrogen in there and i remember pete's d when pete went to that cannabis cup in san bernardino
he had his d with him it had that really strong that bleachy chlorophyll taste and is that that's
the taste of the d that that bleachy kind of thing right i imagine so because that's why
p bud said it tastes like chemicals chemical weed almost like a pool cleaner thing because
it's interesting how the the four is similar but different the 91 skunk va is similar but different
right and then the d is the d it seems even though they're the same family they're like
distinct kids in a way yeah well the sister is is similar to the d uh it's just that it was a
little bit more sativa uh it grew a little bit more leggier and stretchier and you know even
even the effect was a little bit more sativa so those two were very very close the three and the
four were were pretty similar uh the four the three just was a was a smaller plant it was like
a little bit more citrusy i would say where the four is a little bit more pioneer and
um yeah and and then then the 91 was just kind of you know um kind of like you know something
you know very kush like i would say you know the way that it grew you know because it had that kind
of like the stretchiness between the nodes and the the the the dense kind of popcorn nugs and stuff
and so your experience is the 91 that you know the same as the 91 skunk va yeah yeah those those are
the same you know but you know but for me like it's you know um you know how similar the 91 and
the og kush are you know it's you know it you know it's like there are only it's like it's like one
degree of separation and you know i i don't know exactly what what that is you know that that you
know that makes them different but they seem to be you know so similar but you know different and
you know um i would just like didn't you know no it you know i i would think the 91 came first but
you know that's you know just my own you know speculation but maybe the speculative theory on
the source of og in that then og might have got you know 91 might have gotten crossed into some
type of different you know plant that you know gave her those characteristics you know diesel is
yeah yeah i would have to think it's like some kind of pakistan or afghanistan kind of kind of
a strain you know if you know if you and if you look into some of those land races and you know
a lot of them have um you know even though they're mostly sativa they some of them do have
a lot of um sativa characteristics in some of them so um yeah you know it's really hard to say
what what those strains are and what the origins are but you know uh this by some you know now we
we start to get a good look into what's instead some of these land races in afghanistan
in pakistan with some of these land race seed companies and you know some of the hash that they
show and the descriptions of them and everything and you know it's you know for me i just think it
just you know kind of goes back to that region somehow well i think what's going on with og
is it's got southeast asian genetics in it not necessarily thai possibly but there is below the
equator genetics and that thing you can tell the way it grows it's so it's real greasy so
you know like ogs don't wash good at all really for for rosin and so that tells you it has a lot
more greasy so you know sativa's sativa's got more greasiness to them that the south southern
hemisphere strains do not just all sativas it strains below the southern hemisphere tropical
type environment and strains because that acts as a sunscreen and there's some things about og if
you know these plants are just like humans and evolutionary traits are based on environment and
conditions over time they adapt to those things now og doesn't like to shoot its roots out right
it likes wet feet it does better under a slightly diffused light instead of direct light and that
represents all the plants that would be growing in a jungle they don't have a moisture problem
the ground's always moist so their roots don't have to search for most of the trees in a jungle
are very high so a lot of the plants that grow in the jungle are in diffused light because of the
top canopy of the trees and then a lot of those plants are oily that's their type of sunscreen
and the chem line the og line all the headbands the saridese all possess a lot of those
characteristics the oils the lankiness the flower time the structure so now i my theory is there's
southeast asian genetics involved in the line and i think this is what i think whether i'm wrong or
not i don't know we'll learn but i think og comes from the chem family the chem family traveled down
the coast of florida whether it got crossed to something or selfed itself or something was added
i don't know but i feel that the source of the crepe and the super knot which is known as og
is from the genetics that traveled down the coast because there's too many similarities between 91
and diesel and the rest of the chem line there's too many similarities for og to just pop up in
florida on its own and not be related at all to any of these and i think it's the southeast asian
genetics because if you look at og it that's why they called it kush berries it grew like a sativa
but the buds were like kush so fuji and his brother called it kush berries it didn't get
the name og until it went out to the rainbow in la but before that it was kush berries because
it grew like a sativa but had buds like a kush and the other thing about og is it's a lot like a tie
where it has no ceiling and no tolerance you can keep smoking it and get high and throughout the
week and the month and whatever it'll keep getting you high where a lot of weeds might have a high
tolerance but they won't get you high throughout the month or they have a low tolerance but will
get you high throughout the whole year that's where tie was real unique is you could keep smoking
and the more you smoke you could end up getting sick and dizzy off it because they had no ceiling
or tolerance and i notice og is very similar and the i think it's medicinal genomics they did some
dna testing and they showed skywalker was the closest relatives to one of the chemdog family
and i thought that was interesting because there was a guy in the west coast he's called morpheus
he's really well known guy in the weed world he looked at me one day and goes dave og came from
florida i was like no way morpheus i didn't want to believe it i think and this is a west coast
thing like no way he's like he looks at me goes dave og came from florida and then about five
six years we hear josh in fuji and all those guys say yeah og comes from florida and i went holy
shit damn morpheus was right and he said skywalker was the first one that came from florida which i
think is interesting because they think it's the ghost slash whatever one was the sfv or whatever
was came from florida and what's interesting that kid alex that got the bag seed of the og and grew
it and gave the clone the fuji he's on the adam dunn show going yeah it's og like california's
but it's a lot darker and denser buds that's what skywalker's like skywalker is darker and denser
buds than the rest of the og family so i found that really interesting so based on my experience
and strain knowledge and medicinal geonomics i think it's chem related came down the coast and
the first og was skywalker and that's what went to california and from there on thc farmer remember
jj when rascal were all growing in fox farms and they'd over ripen it to get it to foxtail so they
could take rad photos and thc farmer and ic mag were filled with these rad fire og photos of
amazing foxtails well they made bananas and those bananas were our next round of ogs that came out
in la because you got that first original round right if if og comes from florida to cali to josh
and go to the rainbow within a year or so you got hell's angels cut soul assassin cruise lemon
larry's tahoe's sfv 818 skywalker those are all the originals and like you guys say the ones that
you couldn't make hash off them because there wasn't a lot of resin on them at all bubble hash
guys couldn't get much at all there wasn't much resin i remember some of the armenian russian dudes
ditching their ogs to go with blackberry because they could make so much hash off it and we were
going are you guys nuts like no man we like the hash or like this is the best weed there is in
the world what are you guys doing they wanted hash so they got rid of their ogs and then these
over ripening them for the photos made bananas made s1s and that's where these ghosts in jupiter
and all those planetaries and all those came from and those were more resiny and then you had dudes
like swerve and captain crip and a few other dudes breeding them and that's where you left the three
blades because all the original ogs in clone form would only make three blades period never five
blades ever and then the the more newer ogs you started getting the five blades the tahoe's and
the jupiters and the yodas and the vips and the paris they all had the five blades um and a lot
more resin right so you can kind of see this progression of ogs throughout la because the
one thing is la loved its ogs i mean we're the king of ogs the russians loved it there everybody
loved goddamn ogs i was blown away like i'd go the clone store and go for my 10 little clones i thought
that was a big deal got to sneak them out to the car in the bag even though it's medical we're still
scared to death and these russian dudes would be in there like bro i need eight trays of tahoe and
12 trays of fire and i'll just be like what that's i'm thinking that's a thousand clones these dudes
are nuts how big are their grows like i was blown away they were just all over og and then
like sour d wasn't too common swerve had it in a couple people had aj's cut but that wasn't that
common in la and then i noticed east coast or sativas joints that type of smoking west coast la
are ogs and glass bongs and cookies right and then jay-z i think you guys explained to me in
the east coast you're indoors a lot you want to be uppy and lifty and doing stuff because
you guys are indoors a lot via the weather and stuff whereas la we're outside all the time and
everybody just wants to smoke a glass bong and do big heavy bong tokes so i like you start noticing
the different niches in the markets right east coast or your sativas piffs hazes you know sours
all that more sativa leaving hybrids whereas la we wanted all the cookies all the og all the real
heavy stuff a little comment from trevor he's got his phone charged but purple to the bay and the
gas to la yeah what he's saying there because i noticed as soon as you got out of la people their
hair was a little longer and they'll smoke pipes and joints and they're more you know cool easy
going but la is like ego right hip-hop rough real sharp edges jagged people bongs cookies yo that
kind of thing and it's weird how there's i guess kind of like a microclimate there's micro taste
and markets as you leave further the more up north right they want organic big nice joints
of organic grown the weed can be fruity all different types of weed up north but in la
no you got to have a certain type right i imagine new york you got to kind of have a certain type
i'm guessing but there's microclimate markets i guess and that's when you talk about branding
i tell people who you selling your weed to look what those type of people are and how they like
to smoke and what they like and that's that's your market right you're not going to sell blue dream to
people in la and you're not going to sell og to people in norcal you got to find the happy mediums
and target your markets and that's kind of the branding as well right a lot of this industry is
branding now the the old the old joke was uh you know in la your menu was sativa indica or og
and you did you had three different reader boards it was pick one of the three it's totally right
i don't know what the hybrid would be it'd be like a blue dream and og right you'd go in these stores
and they have like 70 different ogs on the board how do you sell them but they bought them and sold
them i don't know it's it's good weed good weed sells itself right it does and you mentioned you
know kind of east coast sativas that's what i always associate too is you know east coast kind
of sativa more the hazes like did did uh og like come on the scene there and take it by storm or
did it ever get traction on the east coast no you know it it popped its head up here and there
but it just really wasn't there in in abundance you know the supply just wasn't really there it
was really hard to find actually even when it first started coming around and um the king of
east coast is the sour huh yeah i mean you know in new york it was you know pretty much the sour
and the haze and then you know the the chems after that i would say but you know new york
very high pace you know you got to you know you know have a high pace lifestyle and and be
constantly moving so those two teams are heavy narcotic high and stuff so that's you know one
of the reasons why you know people really really like them and um you know the but you know the the
the the hazes had been coming up from florida since you know the early 90s you know where you
know the showers really didn't didn't come around till probably around the mid mid 90s or so so
you know you know there was always i guess uh a longer history of of haze you know than there was
of showers or chems in in the city oh yeah but even in the 70s right because that was your guys
a smuggling route it was really close to columbia my dad talked about one time there was a they were
getting a shipment of 40 000 pounds from columbia sent over to california to long beach and they
said that wasn't that common it was mostly all mexican and there was one boat that had 40 000
pounds on it that came in that was like a big deal they went all the way they got taken up to
malibu for some reason everybody was all excited and partying up in malibu at this house where it
got distributed but we yeah we got all mexicans very rarely did you get colombians yeah well
our columbian you know route was pretty much a cocaine smuggling route which came from columbia
to miami miami to new york yeah because that's probably seven eight hundred miles columbia is
probably pretty close to the tip of miami whereas if you brought the weed from columbia to california
you're looking at maybe 1500 miles or more so right there's a lot more risk in order to get
that weed there so you're better off just shooting mexican up the coast and then on your guys's side
you wouldn't probably want to take mexican because the risk would be higher and it's probably not as
good as colombian so all the colombians shot up on that side that's what my guess would piff would be
would be like an a colombian afghan cross because a colombian would take like 20 weeks indoor
so that would be miserable trying to go indoors in new york and sell it so i imagine if you cross
it to an afghan of some type you could keep the colombian profile but you'd speed it up and add a
little more weight yeah suppose guys in the old days thought of that and that's what the piff is
is like a colombian afghan possibly yeah it's supposedly an nl5 haze oh okay something basically
hey well that incense comes from colombian and that's why we smell it in haze and anything
it's related to haze or colombian it's that crazy incense smell right well well some of the
colombians too have you know that jackie kind of sharp sharp kind of yeah so you know you know uh
because i've grown out we grew out some of the original haze from tom mccormick
and those those ones were from mel frank supposedly those colombians but we're supposed to
be yeah they were acrid pissy kind of huh and so when we when we grew them out at verde they came
out kind of a little bit of jackie you know they weren't really you know what we we expected but
there was a little bit of pissiness in there but i'd have to say that that those uh turps are
probably more or more recessive you know where the jacked herp is a little bit that's because
those were dutch haze that was reworked haze versus like a pre-dutch haze is that frankincense
myrrh honey uh clove type of thing that's it reminds you of frankincense honey and cloves
kind of that real incense type floral incense not like the afghani nog champa it's more of a
frankincense clovey honey thing where where does like a5 fit into that well that was that was well
that was the the a5 was the colombian male and so that and you know so neville you know used that but
you know a lot of that was never released commercially and you know and then the a5 too
i believe was a cross of two different colombians the colombian gold and you know a different
colombian i don't know exactly which one and then so then they crossed that into what i believe a tie
and that became i think the super silver i think well also the uh the nevels haze but
also they had to see haze so you know you know it all depended on which year you got the seeds
from or whatever so you know each year was different so um you know so so that's why haze
is so diversified you know there's a lot of different versions of haze or dutch haze you know
there's you know the soma haze where you were his is a little has that more citrusy kind of orangey
kind of a tip to it and um so i don't think any of the the modern slash dutch hazes have the
colombian profile like the piff or the hazes that were in the west coast before they went to holland
they're gonna be metallic or sweet or kind of acrid pissy all those well just the a5 did and
really what happened was they lost the a5 male and so they have you know the a5 clone which was the
nl5 haze across to that and so that was they have a5 nls in the fridge but i've never grown them
right but karma used that clone and he outcrossed it i think into a white
og or something and then he back crossed it and stuff so uh so yeah he did he did a little bit
of work with that a5 clone to um you know get get the genetics get the genetics out there
um otherwise you know the only other uh well we had the uh the the black haze which is a you know
which is a5 hybrid and also supposedly the dog shit which i just got a clone of and so uh yeah
i'm gonna be growing that out and see uh pull down that one's pretty good yeah fog shit yeah
i have remember i have the original haze before amsterdam i brought it up to the emerald that
near over there those big puffy crazy buds right so i'm throwing those again right now there's just
no dudes so the only thing i can do is self him but selfing him is better than nothing but it is
the original haze pre holland it's total honey clove incense you can get there's a seems to be a
green pheno like a golden one and a brown one the pictures are on my instagram you tend to get
three phenos from them the green one's a little sharper taste wise the middle one is the honey
clove incense and then the darker one takes on a hint of sweet just a smidgen of sweet more than
the others but it's yeah and it's i don't know uh not quite 20 weeks but it's up there
and those seeds came from my dad's friend via the big island they've been over there
that's that's weird a lot of these you know what i noticed military dudes after the military they
like to isolate themselves and be by themselves they don't like to interact with people too much
and which is kind of cool because some of the rarest genetics i got are these ex-vietnam military
brotherhood dudes that still live in hawaii that don't interact with anybody that still have all
these genetics yeah a lot of that stuff was was was thai a lot of that stuff in hawaii was thai
based well what's interesting is my dad like you know we always got a guy he's like oh that guy's
got the best weed that guy grows the best weed well my dad and his buddy lloyd the brotherhood
guys they're always talking about this dude tom legacy and this guy was a legend because in
temecula he grew like two massive greenhouses of malawi cob in the 70s this was like a big deal
huge and this guy was in the weed big time like us pot snob connoisseurs like we are but back then
and this dude was collecting all these seeds and writing the names down and saving them
and what's a trip is my buddy in kauai he's like yeah i've been helping this old guy out named tom
and he's got kids but they don't smoke but man you should see his stuff he's got some old stuff
dave and i go yeah it's a trip blah blah and then six months later he goes yeah tom's got growing
these wahakans and i got to trip i goes his name legacy he goes yeah how did you know i go that's
my dad's friend what a trip tom legacy he goes yeah so he calls tom up he goes yeah do you know
paul and lloyd he goes yeah i know paul and lloyd so tom and his brother they finished this massive
greenhouse grow of malawi cob sold it all and moved to kauai we're going to start a real estate
company and has been there ever since the brother came home but legacy's been there ever since this
dude has all the genetics you can think of he's been over there since like 76 or something so i'm
thinking god dang i bet a lot of the hawaiian genetics there have his stuff involved he has
everything all the ties africans he was in the peace corps back then was going around collecting
this stuff too in the peace corps just everything wahakans all the mexicans yeah and just the last
few months or so they're like whoa he's tripping out that somehow we found each other so my dad's
79 and tom's 78 and tom's over there in kauai and i mentioned to don the other day it was like
we got to get this guy to go on the shows and talk about this because this is
incredible like these are the dudes the brotherhood dudes looked up to for having the most amazing
weed and then what are the chances of me crossing paths with this dude because there's lots of
people in hawaii right and this dude's a hermit and it turns out don happens to be helping them
grow plants and don had no yeah so tom's alive he has amazing genetics and i wouldn't be surprised
with a lot of hawaiian genetics that are we know of today or probably have have to do with him
because you know uh mike from coastal seeds him and his partner brought afghani hash plant seeds
to kauai and that's what the kauai electric is so if you've ever heard of that kauai electric
hawaiian weed that's actually afghani hash plant seeds acclimated in hawaii and it got the name
because there was power line road that had the power lines going up the hill and the helicopters
couldn't fly low next to the power lines so they planted the weed under the power lines that's i.e
how it got the name kauai electric i did get sent some of those from a person on the island that i
have yet to pop i was going to ask you about that so that's awesome you just mentioned i've been
going to hawaii for a long time used to do surfskate and snow photos and work for volcom and
just loved hawaii so i've been going there for a long time and then with medical starting it opened
up i already known a bunch of people so i've been fortunate enough to be close friends with people
on all these islands geez since like 88 so yeah i have access to a lot of really rare stuff really
rare stuff that's kind of how i got my kona gold can i call that the holy grail of weed stuff i got
an old can they used to put kona gold buds in and ship them out of there and it's got kona gold label
on it and stuff in the 70s i've always that's freaking fascinating by the way because that
and audio engineering have been my whole life skate surf snow so that's another conversation
but awesome but yeah puna butter is one that's always been on my list like uh
was there anything that that stood out for you well i'm just learning that the kona gold
maui wowie a lot of those were strains brought over from mexico via the mainland whoever by whoever
and they got renamed then over time you start seeing them get crossed and hawaii's first
psychoactive weed came in during the 50s before the 50s they had no psychoactive cannabis there
and the first military after world war ii that was stationed in the philippines and whatnot
they all partied and smoked weed you know so they were the first to kind of bring the psychoactive
weed into hawaii the next were like the tom legacies the hippies after 68 69 70 the whole
hippie things burning down these guys are making money they all go to hawaii and retire and open
little shops and bring their genetics the hazes and whatnot those get crossed with the southeast
asians that's ie traditional hawaiian weed would be california west coast weed crossed with southeast
asians would be the first hawaiian weeds and it was pretty lax in the beginning but then all of a
sudden pakololo is bad and big crack down so they couldn't grow the big plants no more they had to
grow shorter plants and then you'll hear about 90 day wonders when that's when they started getting
indicas over there because there was such a lower profile that they can hide them a lot better from
camp and all the green harvests so you hear of 90 day wonders and that's why the hawaiian gene
pool got fucked up real quick is because all the indicas came over quick right and kind of like
cali when we were getting mexican mexican and all of a sudden canadian weed started showing up
same with hawaii just as it showed up in california lots of that canadian weed went to white so they
started finding seeds here and there and planning that and that kind of what pushed all the original
hawaiian genetics out of the way and you don't see it no more is because of how risky it was to grow
it and then all the new stuff coming in and that's kind of the hawaiian organs but a lot of it was
southeast asian a lot of it and then i sent some of that to phylos and it turns out that some of
the ties and well the hawaiians that we thought had ties in it are coming from like uzbekistan
and pakistan so it makes sense because india it's when you're up close up top they're real close
all those countries are fairly close there you go pakistan afghanistan pakistan you're going to
run into india burma nepal thailand cambodia they're all around that certain parallel right
and that's that magical parallel around 34 we're all for some reason all the best weed around the
world all comes from that 34 area of parallels it must have to do with the sun positioning or
something over the plant the whole time could be that uv or something funky but that's you know
that is something that people talk about the island strains and jj too you mentioned you know
a lot of tie there how how did those like some of those hawaiian strains reach new york i also kind
of associate hawaiian strains with racier hazes sativa type stuff the new york style i guess
um i guess people are just you know smuggling it in and importing it you know i was really
a little too young at that time to really be in the know uh i just know i just knew when some of
the local dealers had it and it was around and and you know back then most of the weed was brown so
and when you were able to get the hawaiian it was always you know bright green seedless you know had
you know a tropical kind of fruitiness to it or whatever guava pineapple-y type of thing or
something yeah yeah i mean back then you just didn't see weed like that so you know it was you
know it was really special and um yeah it you know it's just hard to believe that you know uh like
i i don't know if it was strain specific or whatever but you know even with you know um
you know with them having medical and all that the easing of the laws i don't think that they
be able to reproduce some of that old magic you know maybe some of these guys kind of like what
dave is saying maybe some of these genetics still exist but they're not in the in the mainstream
anymore and you know because i've seen some outdoor weed uh from hawaii in in the past few
years and you know none of it has been anything that has been like i would label as super special
or anything like that but then again you know uh you know we were smoking weed that was probably
you know 10 or 12 percent thc so when that stuff did come around you know with it you know that
that's what made it might have made it like super special back then so you know it it's kind of hard
to tell you know to try to compare yesterday to to today but you would think that they would still
be able they got that that growing climate so you would still think they would still regardless
be able to you know produce some some fire and always one of the things about the the the hawaiian
genetics it was never about the seed i think it was more about the the climate and environment that
made it special particularly outdoors you know i don't think the techniques have really changed so
it would be the genetic have you been to hawaii chad yeah i've been to a big island and then maui
so that's great so a good example is hawaii is really unique because you'd be in kona it's like
a regular city right you even get a little bit of traffic during the day but then you could go
towards the other side of the island towards hilo and it's like another world like in oahu they call
it the country and town because town is like the town and then four miles up the road you're on the
road and there's a dude with hogs he just shot strapped on the front of the hood just like the
deer and stuff with a bunch of bruddas in the back of the truck so harai is real unique because you do
have a lot of time capsule guys these chicken fighter guys you know they live on the back road
and that's where they've been their whole life who wanna associate with the townies and all this
crazy you know and there's a lot of isolated guys over there so if you have the right network
you've you come across these guys and they still have the stuff because they don't go outside their
network and they just keep growing the same thing over and over so there is some stuff locked in
time capsules but on the other hand hawaii is unique because it's one of the most isolated
remote places on the planet it is from another land mass it is really isolated and every it's a
small place and they have the internet too and they want what we have right they see what we have and
they want it and things are easier to get now so younger just like young kids today don't care about
haze there's a lot of new kids in hawaii that could care less about the old uncle stuff i don't
care about the uncle stuff or my daddy stuff we want these cookies bro right can't blame them you
know they want to be a part of the big world too they're young everything's new so that's why i
think hawaii is real unique because i've never been to a place where you can be in a full-blown city
with traffic and almost smog and beep beep beep and then within three miles you see the most ethnic
hawaiian dudes ever like i said with bloody hogs on the truck in the bush and that's no place that
i've been to in america is like that so it's you know there is it's good to know that some of that
stuff is there if you're into it it's around but on the other side i get it they want the new stuff
and hawaii is magical because those places are built off a volcano so all their sediment is
decomposing plants about 90 of it right whereas on the mainland continent we have so many tectonic
plants and in erosion going on that these are broken up rocks and different minerals and
limestone all this different stuff whereas hawaii those things came up something started growing
and over thousands of years that stuff breaking down is like one of those compost posts right
so their soil is freaking amazing they have the best lighting you can ever imagine from sunrise
to sunset it's just amazing lighting and it could be something to do with magnetic poles
between the volcanoes because the manic anomalies are a little odd over there so that may have some
influence with the weed because like the reason why i think the hawaiian was in new york because
new york are high-end connoisseurs and they want the best weed and they know the best weed and
that's why the hawaiian weed was in new york because it was the best damn weed these guys
know their shit just like in california that was it was legend anywhere you know it was always known
that hawaii had the best strongest weed there was from my dad's era to even me growing up i remember
the first time my dad gave me weed i think he knew i was taking it but gave me weed was
new year's eve 1986 and he gave me some hawaiian weed i guess he mailed to him and that was the
first time he ever gave me weed and it was new year's eve and he goes here and i'll never forget
that shit new year's eve rose parade partying like crazy on scooters and shit with all my buddies and
i had this nutty crazy hawaiian weed like holy shit and i got it because everybody was wasted
it tasted amazing it was different than everything so even then at 17 i was like something about this
dang hawaiian weed is special so and that's why i was kind of stoked because i entered the contest
over there and i did pretty well and i was like whoa that boosts my ego because i always looked
at hawaiian weed as the marker and how would something i made stand up to hawaiian weed and
it did pretty well so i was through the roof excited like the most proud contest i've ever won
that one because i put hawaiian weed on such a pedestal i hope that my weed could be that good
you know it's almost because of the isolation maybe just the region of the terroir but there
is something distinct about it you know it takes on the fruit because they if you grow the weed
in guava soil for a while it will take on the guava flavor same with the mango right it'll take on
those flavors and some of these guys been growing generations in that stuff on their plantation
so the just like big sir holy takes up the sage because sage is very natural to that area along
the california coast right just like our pakistani plants are a little more piney because look at
that area of pakistan it's all pine trees it looks like goddamn humble right so just like humans these
plants take on the characteristics their environment do you guys know to to kind of
that point too and that was one of the things uh with like the strain hunters is you know you're
just like you're going to these isolated regions with these plants we've been searching for but
you're also giving them current genetics some of these like colombians some of this acapulco golds
have either of you gentlemen seen them in the form that you remember them any time recently or are
they kind of gone to history to exactly kind of what we're saying here on because i had a friend
i recently went to columbia married a colombian chick just a few months i was like dude get me
seeds like oh no problem because she's stoner chick and he's stoner guy and oh dude i got you
a bunch of seeds he brings them back and they're all new stuff i was pissed gorilla glue this and
white widow this and i was like no every every seed had a tiger stripe i was so bombed right i'm
looking for little seed with no stripes that's your clue and here's one way to tell old genetics
you test them for the thc and the terpenes that's why the highs everybody wants the highs of the old
genetics because they're not muddled with the whole bunch of terpenes they'll have maybe out
of 15 they got like six and there's a certain amount of those terpenes right and your entourage
effect with the thc gives you that clean psychedelic high now with our gelato sunset sherbet
this you pull up your terpene test there's like 24 terpenes shooting off the chart that's why the
highs are so crappy nowadays is the highs muddled like a jumbo soup it's got all the shit thrown in
there and so if somebody says they have old genetics you can verify it by getting them thc
tested and terpene tested and if the thc is through the roof they're full of shit and if
there's a million terpenes in there they're full of shit uh lost it sorry i was gonna just say uh
that that's actually a good kind of marker there and it's a DNA test right yep jj have you seen
any of those like the panama reds columbia golds anything still floating in the form i mean there's
a lot of people that have some of those genetics i mean coastal mike i think has legitimate red
you know so you got to kind of do your research on some of these people i think bode he might have
some of their original alcapoco gold so um you know if you do your research you know but you
know the thing is it's like you know you we might remember them as what we got them back in the day
as imports you know i mean so growing them even if you had those same seeds today now growing those
same seeds indoors is now you're gonna have a totally different product you know uh this you
know despite the way that they cured the bud outside and you know the the storage and the way
they handled it and everything so like today to try to say you know uh you know even if you had
real alcapoco gold would it turn gold if you grew it inside and i would i would say i'm not a clue
for that for you guys i know probably not you know i mean most of the time that stuff turned brown
because it was it i mean i think they let it uh they let it cure on the plant in the field still
yeah that's what they did they call it girthing where they cut the cambium layer around the bottom
of the plant off the green layer they cut the cambium layer up and it can't pull in nitrogen
and they would let it grow a little longer and then chop it and that's how it would dry golden
and that's why it had a little more of a sweeter taste because there was way less chlorophyll in it
kind of like a haze the longer you let a haze cure the better it is where a lot of other weeds if you
cure them too long maybe you ruin them but yeah they cut the cambium layer and that cuts off the
the chlorophyll and the plants go golden so yeah you're totally right jj that's how they're doing
it was done actually while i was growing too yeah and i can see that uh sun grid rhythm is
panama rad from coastals and legit also low thc mixed chemoid types yeah i mean i think that
i think some of that stuff you know i had a lot of cbd in it too yeah probably so you know and um
you know and then also you know the our overall tolerance was way was way less lower so you know
if you were to smoke those same weeds today you know i don't know if they would have the same
effects or or or not you know so um yeah there's there's a lot of you know a lot of
very very variables you know and people are you know they're searching for these you know legendary
70s strains but i don't know if we can pin them down to the way that they were first depicted as
it's it's a very logical answer and it absolutely makes sense and the more growers know about it
that makes even more sense uh but speaking of kind of mythical strains i know dave you mentioned cat
piss earlier did cat piss ever make it to the east coast because that's a that's one of those
ones people are gonna i know they're fighting over these days yeah i've never i've never
experienced a cat piss so i wouldn't know if you handed me a bag of cat piss or not you know if you
smell like hamster cage cat piss it's urine it's total urine smell i think it's a acrid haze
i don't think it's it's it's a cross of something it's not bred to be cat piss it's yeah it was
racy like a like a haze that's why i kind of ask it just smells like piss so much it just hints the
name like he's like whoa it was like nothing to do with cat piss yeah some of the skunks some of the
colombians show those characteristics of of kind of pissiness and that um uh yeah because we some
some of the stuff that we grew out uh out of that i bred you know we found a recessive uh
sc uh colombian phenol out of out of a skunk and it grew it was the tallest one in the greenhouse
that had really stretchiness to it but it had that pissiness to it and just a little tinge of haze
you know just a little touch of haze and and this was mostly uh a skunk strain so you know it was
really interesting to see the recessiveness come out in the different characteristics that it showed
if i was to guess i'd say cat piss is total hybrid not leaning sativa and
so maybe an nl haze or some kind of haze maybe an s1 or something like that because i didn't think
i don't think you could buy packs of something and get cat piss it's just that of the colombian
haze for sure you know with the piss the pissiness to it because even some of the
piffs kind of have that kind of you know the piff can be a little pissy too
yeah this is full urine not like sour piss like you're yeah there's different you know there's
there's like an ammonia burning your eyes
when cat piss concentrates into like almost a concentrate oil that yeah that's kind of how i
described skywalker out of the ogs it's super pine salt it's rich rich pine salt whereas the
sfv is like lemon pledge fire is like windex they all have their each cleaner profile that matches
how does how does your lemon compare to those to that lemon those lemons it's it's all lemon
no background notes of anything else and it's a real sharp pink lemonade real tart basically
the best way i can describe it is like tangy is tangy this is lemon like lemons no other background
nothing it's just sour tart lemon the og is it's different that's more of like a country time
lemonade in a way you know what i mean where it's like a cleaner lemon taste where this lemon is
real sharp like real concentrated lemony like like a cleaner i had a jack's cleaner too uh that was
just super lemon but that would eat the rubber seals on my ball jars yeah i think it's maybe
limonene or something like that yeah yeah but yeah the lemon is just lemon it was strange because
i live with pro skater and we needed some weed bad we called our friend he got us a gram 20 bucks a
gram right that's what it was in the little teeny ziploc bag and i felt it and i was like sure is
lumpy we pulled it out and it was all seeds like worse than mexi there was maybe three bong tokes
in the whole damn bag four four bong tucks i'll never forget and i was like fuck but i was like
sure is stinky and i hit it and my eyeballs exploded and chat my buddy hit it the skater
and he's like both look at each other with bubble eyes and go what the hell is i never tasted weed
that loud in my life like 10 minutes later it's just breathing lemon so i was like what the hell
is that gave the seeds my dad he grew them we grew about a dozen of them all at one time they
all hermeyed like crazy but i pulled all the balls off and it stopped doing it and we kept the lemon
and that was the lemon never and then when medical opened i literally went to almost every store
there was from la to green angel malibu and i brought in there i said have you ever seen anything
like this they're like no what the hell is this and i go i don't know i'm trying to you know play
detective yeah the first time i met arjun i asked arjun in 2009 he ever seen this weed oh no i've
never seen it uh indica though indica shit and adam denover heard him say that he goes what'd that
guy say to you don't listen to him it's like you ever seen any weed like this he's like no the
closest i've ever seen of this is like the sour d but it's not the sour d but it's similar so the
closest that was ever heard was like the sour d and i got the lemon in 96 which is ironic it came
from a hawaiian guy that lived in long beach and he got the weed from new york so i was like who
knows maybe it's some s1 something out of you know the apartment possibly who knows but all i know is
i got it 96 came from new york to long beach to huntington beach to me and chet's lungs and i had
a heart attack my life was changed after that i mean that's what got me known as lemon dave because
everybody hit that shit went what the hell is that cool story is i was selling it to a dude
who was selling it to snoop dog and the weed was so good when he took the weed to snoop dog all
snoop dogs homies followed him home and did a home invasion and tried to shoot at him and kill him to
get that weed that's fucked up yeah but that's what used to happen sometimes selling the weed to that
dude because i would feel like shit if somebody got killed over my weed so i cut off and he didn't
get the weed no more and snoop got cut off from the weed i don't think snoop cared but still but
yeah that's hey it ain't no fun if the homie can't have none tg snoop supposed to be like
what college football coach family guy not having those kind of characters at your house anymore
supposed to grow up snoop snoop snoop a loop um yeah yeah so cat pissy i don't know
a lot of these things are s1s too and people run with them yeah some guy did something and magic
came out but unfortunately nobody knew or didn't want to say and people got him and that's their
stuff now i guess that's just the way it is yeah i mean it goes like that you know everything
we all bet we we bought a bag of good weed we found a seed we grew it and the rest is history
that's i got i didn't make the lemon i didn't nothing i found a seed and grew it and it was
really good i'm just a lot of winter that's all didn't try to run with it never said i made it
or i got a cut or nothing i just found seeds and it turned out to be amazing you you cultivate it
you cultivate it you keep it around you select that is that's something well back then too is
like so that was the other thing you grew really good weed and then you'd sell to somebody or give
it to somebody or they'd smoke and go oh where'd you get this from like oh just some dude it was
so risky that you couldn't tell anybody that you did that you had to say oh some dude some dude i
know you couldn't take credit like the high times i walked into the record store and i look over and
i was like damn that picture looks like my picture on the cover and i looked and i was like
holy shit that is my picture on the cover i had a heart attack and i was so excited but i couldn't
tell nobody because it was the cover of high times and that shit was super early i couldn't tell
nobody the first one of the first photos ever got published was a cover of a magazine i couldn't tell
nobody i was so bummed finally when medical happened i was like yeah but even then i don't
because they put my last name in the mag for all that stuff because i've had a lot of pictures but
they put the last name i don't know why they did that they they didn't connect the dots
i feel you i feel you all the descriptions are wrong whatever you write they put their own stuff
none of anything that's written in there i never said so yeah that was ed he already mentioned that
oh we just put anything the pictures were great we wanted to use them we would just write anything
sounds like okay that was uh when malcolm and those guys worked at high times but i think
something went down at high times and like the whole entire crew disappeared from new york because
some shit went down or something i know there was a shit yeah there was a change of management they
went her owners they went out to la but they were in new york for the longest time i still have the
letterhead from danny danko i got that shit right my check would come from times corporation new
york from high times i was like what a trip i'm getting a check from times that owns high times
in new york i was like what a trip right when you're 17 18 year old you're getting paid for
weed photos it's still illegal oh what a trip this is weird shit yeah were they were they
kind of known or did they make a presence on the on the underground scene uh jj you know i've heard
of like washington park like was high times cool or was high times trying to be as like hands off
with the local cannabis scene uh just because of exposure um i mean early on i mean back in a day
a washington square like no i mean you know i think they were more focused on international
stuff because we're really talking probably in the mid 80s or so um and you know then a lot of
that focus kind of shifted you know more locally probably uh more in in the in the 2000s or you
know maybe you know when sour diesel came on the scene and stuff that was probably one of the
probably one of the first ones to get really recognized and stuff and yeah but you know like
he was saying i think you know there was a couple different regimes of of high times and
and i think the one that he's uh referring to in the 80s with um uh steve hager and uh
rose and a lot of those guys and and so you know when i got in involved in with the high times in
in the 2000s you know a lot of the all those guys were gone you know that's when danny danko was
there uh my matt stang uh nico uh and craig a bunch of other people you know so so they were
so that was a a totally different crew and they were in touch probably a little bit more
with the local new york scene because they were they were a younger crowd and and kind of knew
you know what what was going on locally a little bit more so um you know that's when i was able to
really you know connect with those guys and you know and you know being able to uh you know go to
different you know some of the event you know that's when the events started happening and
you know and you know and that was you know uh the beginning of bringing bringing a lot of a lot of
people together you know bringing the community together where we could actually you know start to
meet in person and you know and and those early shows were were really big you know and
and instrumental and really you know uh pulling you know everyone together
into the scene to make it is what it is today
just totally randomly i remember uh walking through washington square park on like a sunday
and there was a wiener dog meetup and there were like 300 wiener dogs and their wiener dog owners
all meeting up in washington it was like 10 a.m on a sunday morning yeah that was pretty funny
yeah no that place was you know really unique because you know you'd have different groups of
people that would would meet up there you know you had tourist people that would you know tourist
groups that would walk around and and such and uh so uh yeah it was a real unique experience to go
and hang out there back in the day you know you know uh because it was pretty much a pretty much
an open air drug market sort of speak and um you know the you know the cops you know they would do
their their sweeps and stuff but you know um you know it was just a center point of of being able
a place to hang out you know we would we would you know take acid and sit on the park bench
and drink quarts of beer and smoke joints like all night long you know you do it i mean literally
two three in the morning and you know they never closed the park but you know not all that's kind
of changed now and you know uh so i mean you know it was a lot of fun back then yeah a lot of
central park that big park you guys got yeah no this was washington square park which was down in
the village and it was like a it was like a smaller park uh but it was like kind of like in the center
of uh center center of greenwich village so you know it was you know a lot of it was just a kind
of uh a scene yeah to be able to hang out and just you know a lot of different freaks would show up
and hustlers and you know there was a whole hippie scene down there you know in greenwich village
itself had its own scene back in the day so a lot of that was kind of like remnants of that and
then the central park was you know up north a little bit and that was like a really big park
and you know back then um in the 80s it was really intimidating to go up there because i was i was
younger and i wasn't quite as hip to the city and like you know and i used to always hear these
they used to sell a lot of acid up there and stuff but you know i didn't know exactly where to go
and i remember venturing up there one night and i was by myself and in that and you know you just
had to keep going deep you know deeper and deeper in the portal find where you're where to find it
and i didn't know where i was going and back then i mean there would be you know groups of kids you
know roaming around and like you know if they caught you off guard or something you didn't know
what what could happen so your style was like warrior style i had little groups of gangs
you know and so you know you had to really be careful and you know i wasn't from the city i
was from jersey so you know they would prey on people like me so you know i eventually years
later i i went up there and i found a spot where everyone would hang out and sell weed and sell
acid and stuff and so you know i became a part of that part of that scene and you know that's where i
really you know met met the weasel and you know and really you know you know we became good friends
and i've just you know became his regular distributor and you know we just built built
off of that and kind of like the rest is kind of history for me you know if it wasn't for that scene
you know i probably wouldn't be you know the person that i am today in the business because i
wouldn't have been exposed to to those people and you know you just don't know where where you would
have you know wound up in life you know if this would have happened or that would have happened but
that's just the way life is yeah sounds kind of like i guess a hate slash venice beach type of
scene over there it was the kind of place where like if you knew about it like literally like
you know like you could just roll into town with your whatever you were selling and go up there and
start networking you know usually when the grateful dead came to town there was always
the influx of people that would come in with different stuff that they were selling and so
and that was kind of like what new york was it was just like people would just come to the city with
you know with their stuff that they were selling because they knew that's where the money was just
like you're saying with the hawaii you know literally people would get on a plane you know
from new york go to hawaii and then bring stuff back because they knew that the markup was probably
two three four times the amount so you know it was always it was always it was always about the
money but listen guys i'm gonna i'm gonna run i i think we can wrap it there earlier in the night
i was gonna remind myself to to be like we appreciate you staying so long with us and that
was like an hour ago yeah but the things i know once you know that you know we get into them they
could just keep going on and on and on and i'm seeing them already at like the three hour and 23
minute mark right now and my lips are kind of dry i gotta go take a piss yeah yeah i i think this is
a good a good uh end point but you guys want to jump back on again and shoot the shit just you
know just give me a little bit of notice so we could do this again anytime awesome good
thank you jay jay dave thank you happy new year and i'll see you guys soon
thank you because while you were on with them i was i discovered the chocolate that my sister
gave me for christmas and i've been eating that and i've been eating tortilla chips and all sorts
of other stuff off camera i know it's very good i was just listening to you guys and eating
so you're in canada chad no washington washington state yeah no i didn't know somewhere up north
right it looks canadian yeah peter thought i was up north too but i'm down here in la so we're all
well not that far i thought you were like in ohio or uh slo yeah see we we had more beasters than we
had mexican brick up here well we got the same beasters right that's kind of crazy that it went
that far we thought because i'm not that you know i was closer to the border trading coke a lot of
people were trading coke for it that was why la got flooded with it well that would make sense
we didn't want we'd rather have junky green weed than mexican weed like the first was kind of bland
cardboardy but then you got the sour ones that the vietnamese guys are growing it's kind of like
sour d a little bit in a way real grapefruity sour big chunks snail tracks on it it wasn't bad
it was actually pretty good yeah you know that is one thing about the pacific northwest i i say we
had beasters like it was almost a bad thing and by today's standard it is but i never had to smoke
the mexican brick so i don't know about splitting it up with a screwdriver like that was just never
part of my life and i'm fortunate for my dad was over the yeah i always got it at the the end of
that process once someone else said pulled it apart and then he just had the shitty weed
versus right when's the last time you smoked some mexican weed last month oh yeah you were
but not brick weed no that's what i wanted to tell you real quick is
once the mexican weed was coming up to cali they realized oh if we just gave them better weed we can
get more money than the mexican so my dad and his friends were sending indica and skunk seeds to
mexico and they were growing all that there that's what you've probably seen mexican weed it smells
skunky that's what we call pretend the car mexican indica or pretend to cut okay okay that were skunk
seeds grown in mexico so on your video that's why i asked you are they big in tiger striped
you basically have like 80 skunk seeds that's they oh they're big they're big no didn't i see
how did i know they're big in tiger striped oh dude uh they're in the other room but you really
make me want to go that's a clue to find skunk is in old mexican indica seeds that's where you can
find it yeah yeah yeah yeah because they even sent seeds to uh uh tie to columbia and they were
growing tie in columbia that makes sense that makes yeah it makes a lot of sense like money
for it so like fuck it because they go meet the growers right down there to get all the weeds so
they're like here grow these seeds instead we'll give you more next year yep well a lot of some of
these lost genetics were are down there and then a good way to find i know i tell people in mexico is
you go to those little shops that sell the little marble pipes and stuff yeah little shops yeah just
hang out keep looking at the pipes and look at this one they'll say hey do you need some help
and you're like i don't know and pretty soon they'll go do you need something for inside the
pipe and then you go oh yeah what do you want and they're gonna pull out the old junky stuff
which is the stuff we want we don't want the new stuff they're getting we want the older stuff
that's how you find the old stuff is go to the little pipe shops and hang around next to the
pipes and they'll come out and ask if you want weed and they're going to bring out a piece of
newspaper with all that smash old mexican in it nice yeah we we got lucky it was it took us five
minutes out of beach we're like let's you know okay that guy you ask that guy dude laughed at us and
yeah right at first and then on the way back down the dock they were like
you seriously you serious we're like yeah we're serious he's like all right
then we did our thing but yeah that's how you could get them remember because mexicans are
sativas slash hybrid so all those seeds are little when you get these big old bb seeds you're like
what the heck what's going on here and they got beefy tiger stripes on them oh yeah those are i
have those but none of our germinating so that's what i'm kind of hunting is old mexican
proteinica seeds you know i was lucky enough um i had mean gene on here when i came back and i was
asking him about just kind of like open pollination and a good strategy because i i want to get into
these i want to find what's there and even he commented he's like those are big and he had a
smile on his face so i'm like that must mean something good you know he's probably awake
right now here's a clue if when you self plants the offspring will show you what made the plant
okay so in other words like i self og and chem and all those because i want to see what possibly
made those and you'll see the recessive traits of the parents and the grandparents so you could
self the mexican indicas to see what you're pulling out of it which might give you a clue
to where okay if i breed with those i want to go this direction i'm getting that out of these seeds
so i want to go after that or you could do a seed increase which would be open pollination
and your randomness is going to be everywhere and one thing he pointed out which is going to
take a lot more work initially but i'm willing to do it is keep the males separate don't let all
the males bust you know take all the females and hit all them with one male and but no keep
multiple males but don't let them bust at the same time like i'm gonna have to do multiple rounds or
multiple yeah because that's what he does is body will take multiple males in the yard and let all
the males shoot in all the plants yeah and then you know if you find something you like how do
you hone in that trait because now you don't know where it came from and like means that if you use
one male at a time and then you find a trait you like now you can start going in to lock in that
trait but if you've got too many males going it's going to be too difficult to go after a trait you
want yeah and then that's just i mean that's what most people would probably do is just the open
pollination because again it's going to be a lot more work but i see this saving me actually years
of time down in the end if i am able to some dudes just want to increase seeds because these seeds are
rare or old or what blah blah blah some people maybe are familiar with the plant already or grew
them and like a certain profile of the plant then that's how you go after it you start trying to
lock it in you know you say okay i did the dad and the mom the mom made these offspring i got
say seven babies i like number seven a lot so now there's a couple roots you can go to try to get
there quick you can take the daddy and put it back on seven and try to back cross it and take
a shortcut or you could go through the kids the offspring and try to match a male that matches
your female and continue a purebred line like that so there's several ways you can go to try
to lock in what you're after either in a long process or a shorter process okay the back crosses
won't be as stable but you're going to start getting more percentages of the plants that you
want versus doing a true breeding process it's going to take longer but your percentage of
offspring are most likely all going to be the same and you said with the you know with the
selfing the s1 you're going to get more or less what it made it but is that going to apply just
to like older genetics with fewer influences or is that still like polyhybrid like some of what it is
and then you're going to get a bunch of basically what probably made that plant based on your strain
experience you'll be able to notice the differences in those phenotypes or whatnot okay so jj was none
but i really think chem dog is the shiva shanty line and the shiva shanty line is the nl line
and there's a particular nl that encompasses all the traits that i was talking about in og right
there's an nl that has tie in it has southeast asian in it and that's what i kind of think is
going on because i've tried shiva skunk and shiva shanties when they came out and they're exactly
like the chem line kind of and if you look at the old catalogs these suckers are identical to the t
if you took the picture and tone it a little way people would not be able to tell the difference
yeah that's amazing how similar so i kind of and if we match the era of the time frame
shiva shanty nl were winning all their awards from 97 to about 91 ish chem dog pops up at 91
ish it fits the time frame correctly shiva skunk is a garlicky skunky thing what's the chem line
right because that nl was oakland indica which is a garlic indica crossed with a tie right
i know i've got to take your word for it so there was an afghan afghan an afghan hindu and then uh
oakland indica tie that's the one two three and then the five was the two and the three combined
the five okay so that's the nl line and i think the chem line slash og has southeast asian genetics
possibly which would be the three which would be the oakland indica cross with the tie and the
oakland indica has garlic traits oh wow clue to the chem line and the shiva shanty and the shiva skunk
now just my based on my knowledge and me working with this genetics that's what i think's going on
whether that's true or not i don't know but that's what i think and i like that whole profile so i'm
not trying to redo d or chem for any of the line i just use all the components i think that made
that and i smash them together and that's why i got the manic in the irene my vintage afghani
since its line like trevor was saying that's what i use as my mail to cross into the chem line or the
ogs to get a dad with because it doesn't it complements the post and then i take that one
and work between the manic and the nls in the irenes and all this stuff i think is chem dog
related and that's kind of my stuff i'm working and that's how i got the garlic skunk now and all
that stuff it's just using what i think are all the components to make my version of what that is
so it's not trying to redo sour or the chem line or anything it's just using those ingredients to
make my version of that type of weed yeah because because you're never going to nail it we both
could have the same you know seed lines and then put them together and it's not going to be the
same thing and we're not going to select the same either though yeah and then nail it too that's all
relative because if this guy grows in soil that guy grows in hydro all the profiles change a
little bit there was a store in la that sold one og under four different names and it was the same cut
growing four different nutrients and it looked completely different not doing dough and no
surprise doesn't so yeah i was gonna say that doesn't surprise me when they cut grown in which
is cool like that's what like talking about stuff growing in hawaii versus main versus la yeah so we
know d is very chlorine bleachy acrid crazy chlorine chest cold taste the four is tiny
dirty feet sour reminds me of like dirty feet and sour pine dang one is a little weird
because i don't know what's going on with the 91 i don't know if it's going to start controversy
and do we even want to go to that area because 91 is my jam and this is all i have left and i'm
freaking sad all i have left because i i got 91 and it smelled skunky and i was in love with it
because it had this closest smell to this roadkill i've ever smelled real a true skunk smell
then someone gives me a 91 cut and it's 91 without the skunk smell no skunk at all but it's got that
kind of dc diesel hairspray chemical kind of like the hairspray thing or whatever so jj's buddy
guy is in la from new york he's super chem connoisseur i got the diesel and i got what i
think is no okay i got diesel i don't have the 91 chem but i take over the diesel and i let him
smell and he goes bro bro where'd you fucking get this so i was like what he goes this is the
original 91 i go what do you mean huh dude this is the original 91 chem where'd you get this
i said no we call that diesel the 91 chem we have in cali smells like a skunk he goes no bro this is
it this is the original 91 so then i went what the fuck is going on this dude knows his chem dog weed
okay this chem dog that he's calling 91 has no skunk in it here's where it's getting a little
trickier the chem dog crew family network are very defensive on their genetics and their names
right so if it's chem d and chem 4 chem 3 chem cis why is it 91 skunk va
because we all know that greg gave the skunk va guys a cut of 91 and on the radio show they say
greg gave us the cut but our favorite strain that we're blowing up in virginia is super skunk
so i'm now i'm going well what we think is diesel and cali turns out to be original 91 but the
original 91 doesn't have skunk va and the chem crew is very territorial on the names and protective
why are they not calling this 91 chem why they call it 91 skunk va
because i believe that super skunk was added to that 91 and that's why it smells skunky
i mean to and and this is this has like the chemical taste like i don't really get the
skunk from it i get the chemical taste which is what i like
i am running some of the twin peaks actually uh where's that jar
oh it's over here that's what i was just smoking so this is the skunk va this is supposedly the
chem 91 back cross two times chem cis so that's from the lucky lucky dogs eco but so i was just
going to say to make it like deeper though this is what it was labeled so it's not even like
chem 91 it's it's pre-91 chem no other well there we go that gets even crazier
if you want to stir up the pot that yeah what if chem dog was fine in 91 what's pre-91 chem
i have no idea i said that to somebody else and they're like pre-91
from the shiva line maybe oh it takes it back to my theories so with only dna will tell
because some people don't want people to know certain things i'm guessing no oh god if if we
had a reputable company that could like seriously map all these and sequence these things there
would be some shattered egos out there i'll just say that we're gonna find out how much
and a full terpene test and that's a poor man's dna
yeah because based on the relationship to the plant either the terpene will be there or it won't
and i've done this before with the fire og and cross to white fire cross of the white and you
can see the fire terpene profile you add it to the white you can see where the white gets added
in and all the fire is still there and so you can tell if you had like a duratrans you could
probably overlay these on an overhead projector and just nail them up perfect there might be
subtle differences in the amounts but the ones that aren't there will not be there and the ones
that are there will be there the only thing that's different is the amounts so yeah that is
it's a poor man's dna test and it will work especially like i said if you can make dur
duratrans printouts and lay them on top of each other then you know right away
right you're just looking for the pattern gotta have good enough testing
there's some decent labs you know yeah yeah the thc match is fairly similar to
true but i mean you'll you'll still get what labs you like in socal yeah i was using the workshop
those guys yeah do they still have a lab or what are they doing now i think so maybe in washington
or norcal somewhere else but those guys were the first guys who went to a high-end university
to actually learn high-end stuff to apply it towards weed i was blown away with these guys
i used to love to i i need to we need to bring jeff on more like i used to talk he's kind of the
one who taught me the concept of like chemotypes and things like that where it's like you know
they're the ones that said you can tell a strain by the terpenes if somebody says they have blue
dream and you test it and it doesn't match the blue dream that actually would be right there
that actually would be right there yeah those those guys are we could do that they cure all dj
short weed for dj for like a year he cures his weed for like a year and they're the guys that
get all his weed and cure it for him yeah they're really nice intelligent guys really nice intelligent
guys yeah i know the guy who when when their lab got raided yeah unfortunately oil they they were
like he lost his entire inventory of oil massive amounts yeah yeah that's a bummer because those
guys were helping out a lot with this the city of la and all the guidelines and all kinds of stuff
and it almost feels like they were targeted because there's lots of people in la doing
way crazier stuff why did you get these guys who would you rather have doing this stuff than like
a bunch of phds and whatever molecular chemistry stuff they have phds yeah they went to usc for all
that stuff these are high-end smart dudes and they're and cool personalities good guys they're
not jerks either you know what i mean yeah it's so that's a rare combo when you meet a lot of
knowledge and they're humble nice guys that's a pretty rare combo yeah i like jeff this reminds
me we will have jeff we'll catch up with jeff soon that's the one thing too uh there it's hard
to judge people at face value on ig because some guys you think are jerks turn out to be the most
awesome dudes in the world and vice versa you know what i mean a lot of people are should get more
credit than they do and people don't know of them for some reason i don't know why but yeah it's a
tricky thing i think shows like this i feel like a lot of people on ig getting fights or on social
media in general getting faced with each other and if they just met in real life they'd probably
actually like each other yeah yes yes they probably said i see it all the time they probably spoke
yeah i love each other quite a few dudes that i've we've bumped head with each other's and
probably thinking i bet i get along with this dude because it's probably because you're so
similar that's why you bump heads so much you know what i mean right yeah oh yeah yep and then
once you realize how similar you're like fuck this dude was cool the whole time i'm a dork
right or you guys are probably arguing the same point just not realizing it but uh here was a
question from luke omez that i was actually trying to bring up or i wanted to bring up you you said
you know like shiva skunk shiva shanti uh the sensi seed strain is that something that you
would still you still think you might be able to find it in those genetics no no so what i understand
is super sativa seed club sold all their seed stock to sensi seeds okay since these seeds
released that line and won all their words and got good results but maybe lost their mails because if
you notice the packaging says number two they're all number two version of everything okay okay
you know shiva skunk 2 shiva shanti 2 then you don't get the same stuff because i think even jj
has grown some of those and didn't find anything so it probably had to be older stock but the other
clues you have is just like california where all the breeders copy the other breeder stuff and
rename it the same stuff went on in holland so if you want shiva shanti or shiva skunk you can do a
little homework and see what other seed companies copied it and you could probably end up getting
that way because a lot of the nls have been copied and that's oasis and they're under a lot of
different names and they're the original nls so you just gotta find their alternative names because
they're copied by other breeders and then you can get those old genetics well yeah i guess easy
example of that one or that pops to my mind is white widow black widow same same thing just
business split well again it's a widow right right and the widow was sourced through simon and those
guys and it got so popular that great white shark you know they all had to have their white crosses
they're all gonna sell copies or versions or whatever yeah but that way i guess finding the
reputable somewhat reputable seed companies and then finding their versions of what you wanted
in the other guy's stuff because they all did that you know yeah my favorite seed companies
was like uh super sativa seed club early sensi seeds and positronics verner man that guy knew
his stuff that guy is super legend that was a positronics guy and not many people hear of him
but he was meeting with mendojo and all those guys same time same thing that's going on here
was going on there on a smaller scale right these would be little coffee shops or places they meet
and all these it was illegal and all these guys would come and do like we're doing sit in a group
and talk strains you know we're trying this and we're trying that and oh i got this oh can i try
that you and they would trade stuff all between each other they go back to their grows and grow it
then they come back and say well this is what i got this is what i got same thing now we're just
doing the same thing as this on a grander scale right when some guy was successful the other 50
seed companies copied his stuff when somebody said cookies is successful now you have 8 000
cookies crosses yeah same exact thing parallel exactly it's just on a larger scale i think
it's america it's what we do human nature although i have been to the cookies
slash greenhouse in amsterdam they're they're they're one now
i i help these guys out and helping them with their label and they grow the weed for cookies
and jesus christ some of that weed is good lemon cherry gelatos and whatnot and these guys
these guys are passionate and love weed so they grow the weed really well and for a large scale
it's some of the best damn weed i've ever seen so that's why i say not all cookie stuff is crap
because there are some guys with passion that are part of it in a way not directly involved
but they're part of the supply chain right fair enough it's from cookies cookie says grow these
we want you to grow these they grow them and give them to cookies so not necessarily part of
cookies but they are helping cookies with their supply chain but the uh just the uh the the cali
weed strains though are ridiculous the the prices are 20 something 20 uppers per gram whereas i could
get the white widow or the hazes for 8 to 12 so that's what i order on their menu like give me
the white widow or give me the haze i'm lucky because i haven't been to a store since medical
i haven't gotten even in a rec store i haven't ever gotten in one well this is amsterdam though
yeah i have no choice over there i like the gray area the tweed carver and the damn cring always
had the best weed especially the gray area because they're american guys and they all had glass bongs
yeah that's one thing about holland they freak out on you when american walks in
and you don't mix it with tobacco and you use a bong and you're hacking everywhere the whole
coffee shop's looking at you like you're crazy and you're like what this is normal
they're supposed to smoke it they look at us weird for smoking it through a pipe and then there was
the time where we were in conversation with people and we pass them the pipe they take one hit and
they're like oh oh okay we're good yeah you're looking to tell american and holland because
they'll be hacking in the coffee shop no they i got called out for having a bic lighter they're
like you must be american like the fuck what i'm just saying like you'll know we need we need to we
need to fly you into russia with like bags of weed and then you can get arrested and we'll we'll rally
the weed community to raise awareness for you so that we can eventually trade you for an arms dealer
i'm not falling on that grenade man i'm not taking that if you can take eight months in a penal
colony you just hold out while we get you back out do you think she was that stupid to bring it
or do you think she maybe they planted it on her to fuck with us i is too well you you'd think now
that she's back on safe land she would be like they fucking planted that on me but i haven't
heard that right oh man she's probably like brainwashed three ways by now she's just a dumb
ass and her friends are dumb asses for telling her are you fucking nuts don't you take anything
to that country yeah i mean yeah i shot skateboarding photos for a long time so i've
been all over the world and i took weed to every country i've been to but just enough to get high
until i could find more wheat the taking it back out part is where i'm like oh my god like you
couldn't get a vape cartridge like right when you got off the plane in la yeah when that's the thing
too is you're like i could leave this behind but there's a little bit of vape oil left in it because
i knew i couldn't bring weed to japan or indonesia i could get busted so i told him i didn't want to
go there so i went to europe and spain and everywhere else and i australia and brought
shit because i knew i could bring it but the countries i couldn't bring weed to i told them i
didn't want to go she either shouldn't have took it or said if you love your weed that much i can't
go play basketball there otherwise yeah maybe they should have let that other guy out it's been in
there for a long time before her because that was just her ignorance i'm a weed tourist we don't go
anywhere unless we know we can get weed yeah i'll just flat out admit that we're weed tourists i'm
not gonna go unless i have weed you're not going to saudi arabia next yet right no no not even not
even my brother lived there for a year and the parties they'd have in compounds were crazy
like they'd ship in all the drugs and alcohol into these compounds and friends would come over
nobody would be wearing you know veils or anything oh wow and then you go back out and like you go
back out into the street and it's like everybody right puritanical kind of life is that right
repressive i never want to be that rich either too you know how miserable it be
think about it nothing is fun no more i don't think any if the rich people from those countries
don't spend time they're like in london and paris and new york it's boring because they have so much
money they can do anything they want that gets old right away you can buy any car any house what
what life is that it's so boring right away i wouldn't be upset to experience that there there
was a study done by a whole bunch of smart people and they said money as far as can buy you happiness
to the point of your necessities are met but it doesn't bring you exponentially more happiness
the richer you are no kind of for the things that you're talking about like if i didn't have to worry
about bills i could you know my dad needs a surgery i could just be like go and have that
surgery let's get you the best doctor in the country that would be fucking awesome but you
know outside of that on a depressed day it's not going to make me any happier yeah like say i hit
it big in crypto i buy a lambo i'm still just dave the dork but i got a magna lambo magnifying my
dorkiness now five times tracking attention to me i haven't changed as a person i'm still the
dork i just got lucky and got a bunch of money and so now everybody sees how dorky i am i'm
attracting a bright yellow lambo uh if i was really rich i'd probably buy a mclaren i like those things
see you've already thought about this though yeah but then i'm already so old that i don't care
yeah right i don't want to deal with the tune-ups what a tire probably costs a thousand dollars for
how are this what are some of your favorite surf spots around the world
i don't really surf but it's been in my family but for photography right didn't you didn't you do
photography around the world jesus obviously the north shore
so much action as far as athletes wise and wave breaks it's just amazing it's just amazing
like yeah i'd like indo and all that stuff too but i'm not a water photographer in fiji and
southern pacific you got to be more of a water guy kind of unless you're in a boat but then
you're just getting the same shot as everybody else but yeah i'd love to see that shit cloud
break and all tabaroos all that i'd love to see it but i think hawaii is probably my favorite
just because it's really unique to how you can get the sunset in the background in the evening
you know it's pretty in each beak break the way that the lighting is at that place early morning
is super good for why i may obey the sunrise pucks right through the bay so the shore breaks like
amazing yeah some hawaii is pretty magical spot and even so kelly though on a offshore
you know what i mean santa ana wind condition when it's super glassy and everything's this
epic california the sprays going and the waves are killer some of those rad shots where the the
lifeguard towers on the beach and you get the whole beach shot with the killer waves and all
the offshore winds like all glowy orange that's sunrise wave up yeah i i live uh half mile from
the ocean where i'm at so walked by it today it's it's like i wear a five six wetsuit so it's
super cold water cold super cold water but i love the waves and just yeah the west coast is i come
from the east coast and the oh yeah terrible really i miss my new england just waves in general i love
taking pictures of waves every one is like a fingerprint every single one is different even
for that thousands of a second it's different yeah i love it i just something about it it's
awesome really cool i used to love that like the hurricanes on the east coast just those waves like
crashing on the rocks or breaking cape which is vicious and violent it's that like full left or
right and it's all whitewashed the wind blowing and the water is all dark and it's this full
going off stormy look yeah i love the look at east coast wave like i've had so many near
death experiences in the ocean and hurt during hurricane season oh no yeah you got it rough
because the super treacherous water and the the cold water as well must really jack you yeah
yeah i've just always been into surf skate snow all that stuff action sport stuff alternative kid
when people are disco i was a mod right i was always going against the grain in some way or
another and that's a satisfying career though to be able to get paid to go to fun spots around the
world it was good while it lasted and take pretty photos the internet killed that because there's
no more magazines so with no more magazines there's no more that's i didn't go to hawaii
for a long time and every time you went during the winter there'd be groups of like 40 50
photographers at sunset and then at pipe and that off the wall these big groups of guys
then i went to hawaii about six years ago and i hadn't been a long time and i was like there's
no photographers anywhere the beach is empty and i didn't understand i went aha there's no more
magazines there's no more revenue there's nowhere to make money there's no use to shoot them
so now the beaches are empty and you just see a few drones flying around and that's
the new thing is drones filming everything with drones
yeah so uh i guess it's the pencil to the pen to the computer right evolution shit changes and
none of it ever stays the way it was i think that's going to go on with our weed too
because i hear my dad's stories and these guys are hearing my story i'm hearing ed rosenthal's
and mel frank and rob clarks and now these kids are going to be hearing our stories and in 15 or
20 years some kid's going to be listening to their stories right and everything will just change and
evolve he who writes history controls history or he who can adapt can survive but if he can't adapt
if he can't adapt you'll get evolved right out of place yeah yeah that's why we're humans because
all the other things weren't able to adapt this far and we ended up on the top of the
food chain so we might as well take advantage of it so yeah the the weed sends fun we can always
wrap i got billions of stories and stuff and genetics and origins and wondering where this
came from well dude we will definitely have to do this again uh i'm glad that you're game because
yeah i'm definitely game uh i know we're at four hours right now but holy smokes time flies when
you're having fun and in a good combo right it does it does because fuck there's so there's so
many different rabbit holes and strains that we could go down or just even history shit we could
even not talk about cannabis for a while but yes where where where should we leave this what what is
the parting message um what is i guess don't judge us either cover and you won't know what you can do
unless you try it and push the envelope then i know you learn when you fail so failing is good
because you learn from it and if you you won't evolve if you don't push the envelope
and also there's no such thing as a perfect breeder at least i've never met a perfect breeder
i don't know about you guys but a lot of people are put on pedestals and kind of come down on for
what they do but you have to remember there's no one's perfect and there's no such thing as a perfect
breeder in in you know what sense because you're right ig does kind of glorify people uh these days
rightfully or wrongfully so but a lot of people are put on pedestals so well
it's we're humans and i think that's what's great about weed is it isn't taken over by machines and
corporations and algorithms there's still this nuance this intuition this human nature involved
still and when that happens there are going to be mistakes oh you said it was going to be this but i
got that well you know that's part of being human you know these seeds i bought feminized seeds in
their hermion well there's a lot more to the picture oh this weed is it's got both sexes in it
in in the right situation you can make those come out of it right so some plants are hard to reverse
and in order to get that strain and feminized form we had to stress them at a high amount so most
likely in the offstring it may exhibit that stress as well it doesn't mean it's genetic it just means
once the conditions are back to what it's used to that expression will go away so a lot of times
when they get feminized seeds they go oh these hermit i threw them all the way well that's not
genetic that's just because of the conditions that it took to make them go intersex to make these
seeds if you grow them correctly in a normal environment that expression will stop and you
won't have the problem take away the trigger yeah a lot of can be lack of knowledge jumps to
conclusions and that's what i mean by not all breeders are perfect and maybe not all grows are
perfect because we all don't none of us know a lot more than the other guy we all just know
different stuff and we're all just sharing each other's information so one guy may know a lot
more about this and not about that where the other guy is going to kick butt and making soils but he
doesn't know about that and we're all just sharing each other's information some breeders are going
to be other better than others but that doesn't necessarily mean they're perfect they'll make
mistakes right some breeders personality-wise are complete jerks but their genetics are amazing
and vice versa you know they're the nicest guys in the world and you want the best for them
but their stuff isn't that good yeah yeah some some of the best people uh lack social skills
but that's because they're busy doing what they're doing and that's way that's why they're so good
so yeah that's what i mean by no breeders are perfect no humans are perfect they're going to
make mistakes and if you get too invested on anticipating something you're kind of setting
yourself up for a letdown right that's that's anticipation patience is supposed to be patient
waiting for something but that's also a form of anticipation because you're trying to be patient
waiting for something right so how can you really be patient if you're still anticipating something
right just wait for it yeah it's just trying to keep an open mind and try to be open and then
make your judgments at that point and if a dude screws up then you like jay-jay says he talked
to him about it and see what happens but otherwise none of these guys are gonna be perfect and you
know i say this because i used to tease sub cool a lot and then he passed away i feel like an idiot
because i was nitpicking him for stupid stuff the guy loved weed same with frenchie you know i nitpick
frenchie and gave him a hard time and when he passed away i felt like a complete asshole because
the dude just loves his weed and i wasn't smart enough to take my blinders off and be able to read
that i got caught up you know with oh they're part of this crew and swami and all these weirdos he
must be a jerk i'll screw that guy you know and i had my blinders on and i screwed up because the
guy passed away and i realized he's an amazing dude he loved weed that's all it was same with
sub cool everybody made fun of bog all these guys that everybody makes fun of and talk shit about i
do the same thing we end up feeling like assholes when they're not around no more so that's things i
try to keep in perspective and keep in mind because i've made that mistake and i feel like an idiot
about it too we're all community even if we don't get along at least hopefully we could agree to just
disagree yeah you can disagree but keep your distance and be cool about it you know what i mean
yep have a little that's why burner will never come on my shows we just agree to disagree
he would come on in a heartbeat you've never asked him i think he's caught in a rock in a hard place
i think deep down inside he has good intentions but his glass is pretty muddy and i don't know
how he's going to get his glass to clear up but i think there's some goodness in him a little bit
somewhere there has to be yeah there it comes back it's irrelevant of him because he's part of a
company that has a lot of investors now and other people like their business guys they're running
the operations he's the face right but those guys like when they started selling seeds and then
they go live and it's like price gouging for every seed and i know that their target audience is the
20 year old dude who already spends some of his limited disposable income on cookies merch
now buying their seeds and they're like they look at that guy and they see dollar signs
they don't see like he's like i love cookies and the love isn't reciprocated
cookies looks at him as fucking how they can pay down their debts we'll see all their
when their loans come due if you were burner would you tell
your investors your holding group no i'm not going to do that
well he's not doing that because he's promoting it heavily well you know what i'm saying he's
not like hey guys this is we shouldn't take advantage of all my fans we should treat them
with love and respect it's easy to call plays from the bleachers but when you're in the game
it's a whole different world like in burner's eyes we could say hey why don't you tell them that
but man when you're looking at a bunch of super multi-millionaires and you want to tell them
something they don't want to hear well that's scary but that's also because they took a lot
of money and they got to pay a lot of people back and make those people happy
they didn't have to take all that money but they wanted to be huge burner or the investors
it's a tricky one like i'm not trying to stick it from burner i'm just trying to look at it from
both sides both perspectives and i see the investor perspective but i can kind of see where burner
could be caught in a hard place because you wouldn't want to go against that that's everything
and they could just say you're out of here so it could be a little intimidating for him
but on the other hand i don't know i think he tried with bode he tried to make a bridge
and it i don't know if it worked out as well as they wanted it to yeah you know i think they both
had good intentions but the community didn't receive it with the intentions they had planned
because we want to be tribal that's just how it goes that's that's the internet that's the internet
it was pretty extreme that does remind me i have a lot of bodie seeds waiting for me when i get home
which is very exciting that's exciting we ended on a good note with bodie because he's a happy go
lucky i like advice to say bad about anybody we'll just end it with bodie on a good note yeah yeah
bodie bodie good nice talking with you guys anytime just let me know i've been watching
for a while absolutely freaking pleasure man thank you for making time anytime nice to meet
you as well cool yep nice to meet you pete all right thanks everyone you will i'll be back in
la in a couple days cool happy new years and uh talk to you guys soon all right all right thank
you later uh should i hit the uh button you want to hit okay i'll hit it oh you'll hit it i'll hit
who what
i'll hit it all right oh you haven't hit it yet
