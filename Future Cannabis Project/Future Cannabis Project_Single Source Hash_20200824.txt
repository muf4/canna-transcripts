[00:14.270 --> 00:23.390]  All right, we are live on YouTube talking single source hash.
[00:23.390 --> 00:24.390]  That's me, Peter.
[00:24.390 --> 00:32.270]  I'm actually all by myself right now, waiting for Kaia to come back with his beer, his frosty
[00:32.270 --> 00:41.190]  beverage and we're going to give away some, I believe some seeds, some packs.
[00:41.190 --> 00:47.190]  Some hash yielding packs, I hope.
[00:47.190 --> 00:51.790]  And actually I'm going to get a beer too.
[00:51.790 --> 00:54.030]  We got people coming in.
[00:54.030 --> 00:57.110]  I don't know what you guys are seeing.
[00:57.110 --> 01:04.750]  If you're seeing me or Kaia's windowsill and we're waiting for Ganja Gill to hopefully
[01:04.750 --> 01:10.350]  the live notification.
[01:10.350 --> 01:16.310]  Yeah, I've never experienced it on the other end where like, I don't know if you're all
[01:16.310 --> 01:20.670]  like on YouTube and then suddenly you get some notification or you get it like as an
[01:20.670 --> 01:30.950]  email or let me just quickly get my pipe and my beer.
[01:30.950 --> 01:32.510]  Hold on.
[01:33.310 --> 01:40.350]  You know, we could even, if I had the music queued up, we could listen to some beats and
[01:40.350 --> 01:43.350]  see who's trickling in.
[01:43.350 --> 01:47.590]  We have a West Coast heavy crew.
[01:47.590 --> 01:48.590]  He's back.
[01:48.590 --> 01:54.230]  What'd you get?
[01:54.230 --> 01:55.230]  What's the beer of choice?
[01:55.230 --> 01:59.750]  Tonight, we're going to have this special one.
[01:59.750 --> 02:01.310]  That looks very satisfying.
[02:02.110 --> 02:04.750]  I did my monthly trip to the grocery store.
[02:04.750 --> 02:06.230]  So hold on, let me grab my...
[02:06.230 --> 02:08.470]  Yeah, what are you sipping on?
[02:08.470 --> 02:09.470]  Can you hear me Peter?
[02:09.470 --> 02:11.470]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[02:11.470 --> 02:12.470]  Let me ping...
[02:12.470 --> 02:20.110]  Hold on, let me get Cascadian's on so we'll have him jump on with us.
[02:20.110 --> 02:21.110]  Nice.
[02:21.110 --> 02:25.230]  Yeah, so this beer is from the Great Notions Brewery, the guys in Portland.
[02:25.230 --> 02:28.110]  And they've recently, I think they're opening a new one in Seattle here.
[02:28.110 --> 02:29.990]  If it's not already open.
[02:29.990 --> 02:31.990]  This is a Double Stack.
[02:31.990 --> 02:35.390]  It's an imperial stout with coffee and maple syrup.
[02:35.390 --> 02:39.310]  And this was actually a gift from my new hash apprentice.
[02:39.310 --> 02:43.150]  Shout out Tyler, the CF Hash.
[02:43.150 --> 02:46.830]  He's a young kid with, he's got cystic fibrosis.
[02:46.830 --> 02:49.750]  And he shows up to work and really busts his butt.
[02:49.750 --> 02:52.110]  And he definitely got the passion for the hashing.
[02:52.110 --> 02:53.830]  So this beer is for you, Tyler.
[02:53.830 --> 02:54.910]  Thanks, buddy.
[02:54.910 --> 02:59.630]  And we're enjoying it out of a nice cool reggae on the river.
[03:00.270 --> 03:08.510]  Interestingly, there was a DJ I was talking to about playing and he was at Reggae on the
[03:08.510 --> 03:11.390]  River, like, you know, one of the volunteers.
[03:11.390 --> 03:15.870]  And I thought it'd be cool to have a couple people get together and talk about reggae
[03:15.870 --> 03:24.070]  on the river and then like have a DJ play a dubby set.
[03:24.110 --> 03:31.590]  So I was thinking of getting like Jason from Ridgeline.
[03:31.590 --> 03:38.950]  Because I think his, if I am correct, his family was involved with that over the years.
[03:38.950 --> 03:39.950]  Oh, awesome.
[03:39.950 --> 03:43.790]  You know, I may be totally wrong, but I was going to reach out to him and I thought it'd
[03:43.790 --> 03:49.870]  be a cool because it's basically like, you know, high times took it over and completely
[03:49.870 --> 03:51.270]  bungled the whole thing.
[03:51.270 --> 03:52.590]  They so bungled it.
[03:52.630 --> 03:58.470]  Yeah, you should also have Mean Gene on because Mean Gene is big into the reggae and he's
[03:58.470 --> 04:02.270]  always losing plants while he's at the reggae festival.
[04:02.270 --> 04:06.790]  Harding through hard while his boys are pollinating.
[04:06.790 --> 04:09.230]  This beer smells incredible, by the way.
[04:09.230 --> 04:10.230]  All right.
[04:10.230 --> 04:16.110]  So tell people what you're thinking about giving away.
[04:16.110 --> 04:21.630]  I was thinking like some hashy cultivars would be kind of appropriate.
[04:21.670 --> 04:28.830]  Yeah, so basically pretty much whatever packs I have, we'll go through and give out some
[04:28.830 --> 04:31.230]  of the stuff from our new drops.
[04:31.230 --> 04:32.670]  I've got some fun swag here.
[04:32.670 --> 04:35.470]  I've got some Pacific Northwest Rue scarves.
[04:37.390 --> 04:41.550]  And I got I'm ordering some new shirts, so I'm waiting.
[04:41.550 --> 04:42.470]  I've been waiting on this stock.
[04:42.470 --> 04:43.510]  My shirt guy has moved.
[04:43.510 --> 04:44.550]  Shout out, Handmade.
[04:46.150 --> 04:48.110]  But I've got I've got this really great old school.
[04:48.110 --> 04:50.310]  This is one of our first release shirts that we ever got.
[04:50.310 --> 04:51.630]  I need that one.
[04:51.630 --> 04:52.670]  I fucking love that.
[04:52.670 --> 04:54.670]  I love the design.
[04:56.070 --> 04:56.870]  That's kind of a cool.
[04:56.870 --> 05:01.710]  But these are these are small, so I and I've got one of my one of my newer shirts to the
[05:01.710 --> 05:02.830]  way the gray ones.
[05:02.830 --> 05:04.350]  But I like them tight.
[05:04.350 --> 05:05.070]  Now I'm joking.
[05:05.070 --> 05:06.710]  What's by small?
[05:06.710 --> 05:08.070]  You mean like a men's small?
[05:09.550 --> 05:10.230]  Yes.
[05:10.230 --> 05:13.070]  Or like a like a youth medium or something.
[05:13.470 --> 05:14.630]  Men's small.
[05:14.630 --> 05:15.630]  This one's pretty small, though.
[05:15.630 --> 05:16.310]  I'm not going to lie.
[05:16.310 --> 05:17.950]  I could have Gemma Rockett.
[05:17.950 --> 05:18.950]  Gemma would wear that.
[05:18.990 --> 05:20.230]  Yeah, for sure.
[05:20.870 --> 05:23.230]  And I got this cool little ganja cap here.
[05:23.910 --> 05:24.910]  The we leaf on it.
[05:26.150 --> 05:27.270]  And I've got a.
[05:28.550 --> 05:31.710]  This is this is like my favorite thing, I went and scooped up a bunch of these and I'm
[05:31.710 --> 05:33.190]  going to give them out throughout the year.
[05:33.710 --> 05:35.750]  This is a Josh Heinrichs playing card.
[05:36.390 --> 05:39.670]  Shout out, Josh Heinrichs, one of my favorite reggae guys from the Midwest.
[05:39.990 --> 05:43.310]  He's come out and done a lot of work with us and he's rocking the root sweatshirt.
[05:43.310 --> 05:44.590]  If you can see that or that.
[05:44.590 --> 05:45.510]  Wow.
[05:45.670 --> 05:46.670]  Yeah.
[05:46.670 --> 05:49.910]  So we've got a couple of these to give away and I've got some really good stuff from
[05:49.910 --> 05:50.910]  Kush Creams.
[05:51.390 --> 05:52.870]  I don't know if you guys know Kush Creams.
[05:53.110 --> 05:59.790]  This gal has been on National Geographic, High Times, all kinds of cool stuff.
[05:59.790 --> 06:05.670]  And I've known her since she was just a crazy kid running around on roller skates.
[06:05.670 --> 06:09.070]  And now she makes us great medicine stuff for folks.
[06:09.710 --> 06:10.710]  Popicles.
[06:11.270 --> 06:11.990]  I use them.
[06:11.990 --> 06:13.270]  They really, really help with pain.
[06:13.270 --> 06:15.310]  So we can send some of these out as well for folks.
[06:16.470 --> 06:17.470]  Yeah.
[06:18.070 --> 06:19.070]  Thank you guys.
[06:19.070 --> 06:23.550]  If you're watching from Instagram, if you tag somebody to come out here and pick up
[06:23.550 --> 06:24.550]  the show tonight, thank you.
[06:24.550 --> 06:28.790]  I'm going to go back through on my phone later and pull up some of those names and
[06:28.790 --> 06:32.070]  reward you guys for helping spread the message.
[06:32.070 --> 06:33.990]  And shout out, Peter, for having us.
[06:33.990 --> 06:40.910]  This is a cool platform to be able to get on and spread the word and talk about hash
[06:41.030 --> 06:42.510]  and cannabis and everything else.
[06:42.510 --> 06:45.310]  So did Gil text you back?
[06:45.310 --> 06:47.310]  I have not heard back from Gil.
[06:47.310 --> 06:50.510]  I'm imagining, like you, that he's probably lost somewhere on the way.
[06:50.510 --> 06:51.510]  Right.
[06:51.510 --> 06:54.110]  As he was like, yeah, I'll do it.
[06:54.110 --> 06:56.510]  And I was like, wait, does he have any reception right now?
[06:56.510 --> 06:59.510]  He's lost in the woods, but he's lost in the wooks.
[06:59.510 --> 07:00.510]  Right.
[07:00.510 --> 07:03.110]  So Gil may or may not be joining us.
[07:03.110 --> 07:06.110]  But well, let's talk.
[07:06.910 --> 07:09.910]  What do you want to talk about hash-wise?
[07:09.910 --> 07:16.710]  Well, the topic tonight, I think we're really going to focus mostly on the type and style
[07:16.710 --> 07:23.110]  of hash that I'm into and the methodologies that go behind it and maybe kind of explaining
[07:23.110 --> 07:24.910]  to folks a little bit about the terminologies.
[07:24.910 --> 07:26.910]  I actually made some notes here today.
[07:26.910 --> 07:31.910]  And also even get into some really basic stuff like what temperature should you be dabbing
[07:31.910 --> 07:32.910]  your soft drink at?
[07:33.710 --> 07:37.710]  I get messages in my DM sometimes and people are like, man, this stuff smelled great, but
[07:37.710 --> 07:39.710]  it burnt this or it didn't smell right.
[07:39.710 --> 07:40.710]  And I'm like, ooh, turn that thing.
[07:40.710 --> 07:41.710]  What are you dabbing at?
[07:41.710 --> 07:42.710]  And they're way too high.
[07:42.710 --> 07:46.710]  So I just thought we'd cover some of those bases.
[07:46.710 --> 07:48.710]  The topic of the night being single source.
[07:48.710 --> 07:50.710]  So what is single source?
[07:50.710 --> 07:56.710]  Single source means that you're not gathering material from a single source.
[07:56.710 --> 07:58.710]  You're not gathering material from a single source.
[07:59.510 --> 08:05.510]  Single source means that you're not gathering materials from a lot of different farms.
[08:05.510 --> 08:07.510]  It's one farm.
[08:07.510 --> 08:11.510]  And generally, if I'm claiming to be single source on my own, then I'm growing my own
[08:11.510 --> 08:12.510]  material.
[08:12.510 --> 08:18.510]  And to me, that's really important because once all your methods for the process are
[08:18.510 --> 08:23.510]  the same, so if me and three other hash makers are all doing the exact same process, right,
[08:23.510 --> 08:25.510]  we've got best practices down.
[08:26.310 --> 08:29.310]  What is the next thing that differentiates our hash?
[08:29.310 --> 08:36.310]  And I think that's where it goes into the realm of your method of production.
[08:36.310 --> 08:43.310]  So if you're growing in a commercial facility using hydroponics, all due respect, the hash
[08:43.310 --> 08:48.310]  is not going to be as quality as if you're getting it from somebody who's using natural
[08:48.310 --> 08:51.310]  farming techniques or growing organically.
[08:51.310 --> 08:55.310]  And can you talk about why that is from your perspective?
[08:56.110 --> 09:01.110]  A lot of it has to do with the terpene production because the plants, I'm trying to think of
[09:01.110 --> 09:03.110]  the doctor's name here, a guy up in Seattle.
[09:03.110 --> 09:06.110]  He's an expert on terpenes.
[09:06.110 --> 09:07.110]  Ethan Russo?
[09:07.110 --> 09:09.110]  Russo, thank you.
[09:09.110 --> 09:12.110]  And he really blew my mind at HempFest one year.
[09:12.110 --> 09:17.110]  He was discussing, basically terpenes are the way that plants communicate.
[09:17.110 --> 09:21.110]  So we communicate with words and plants don't have mouths.
[09:21.910 --> 09:27.910]  So what they do is they put out these smells, these terpenes, and that can repel bugs.
[09:27.910 --> 09:30.910]  It can attract pollinators.
[09:30.910 --> 09:32.910]  It can do a lot of things.
[09:32.910 --> 09:35.910]  It can help humans to select those plants to keep them going.
[09:35.910 --> 09:40.910]  If you've ever watched the Botany of Desire, you'll understand what I'm talking about.
[09:40.910 --> 09:47.910]  So when you're growing a cannabis plant in an artificial environment and you're essentially
[09:48.710 --> 09:52.710]  playing God and setting the tone for what it's taking in and whatnot, that plant is
[09:52.710 --> 09:59.710]  absorbing different profiles of nutrients and it's going to build a recipe for terpenes
[09:59.710 --> 10:03.710]  and when it expresses that recipe, you're going to get a certain smell.
[10:03.710 --> 10:08.710]  And that smell is going to be different from if a plant is grown in a natural environment
[10:08.710 --> 10:14.710]  and it gets to pick and choose and it's using more of a relationship with the microbes to
[10:14.710 --> 10:15.710]  develop that terpene.
[10:16.510 --> 10:20.510]  The same principles apply to food when you're talking about nutrient density.
[10:20.510 --> 10:25.510]  So you can grow a carrot or a tomato using hydroponics without any microorganisms and
[10:25.510 --> 10:29.510]  you'll see the physical structure of that plant there, but the nutrient density is going
[10:29.510 --> 10:33.510]  to be just a fraction of what it could be if it was grown using microbes.
[10:33.510 --> 10:37.510]  And so that's important for a lot of reasons.
[10:37.510 --> 10:43.510]  A, again, your terpenes, the way that those smells actually come out and express themselves.
[10:44.310 --> 10:49.310]  But also as a hash maker, if I've got super healthy plants, they're going to last longer
[10:49.310 --> 10:50.310]  in the water.
[10:50.310 --> 10:54.310]  Their cell structure is going to hold up better and my hash isn't going to green out as fast.
[10:54.310 --> 11:00.310]  And I mean, I can see it on the first couple cycles of a wash, you know, ooh, this is not
[11:00.310 --> 11:04.310]  going to be good or wow, they did a great job growing this plant.
[11:04.310 --> 11:11.310]  So that's why those things are important and specifically important to people that are
[11:12.110 --> 11:18.110]  really seeking and understand the relationship to the high and everything else that you're
[11:18.110 --> 11:23.110]  taking in when you're consuming cannabis and especially hash.
[11:23.110 --> 11:27.110]  You know, once you concentrate it down, those terpenes can get exaggerated one way or the
[11:27.110 --> 11:30.110]  other for better or worse.
[11:30.110 --> 11:33.110]  So you want to start off on the right foot.
[11:33.110 --> 11:35.110]  And then, yeah.
[11:35.110 --> 11:40.110]  So to go back to, I don't know, I lost myself there, Peter.
[11:40.910 --> 11:48.910]  What about, I mean, things like, I mean, is a bigger trichome head a better trichome head?
[11:48.910 --> 11:55.910]  Does a bigger plant produce better hash?
[11:55.910 --> 12:03.910]  I mean, is it like if you planted, let's say in like July and had like a smaller plant
[12:04.710 --> 12:10.710]  and, but is it just that the sun and the elements are just forcing that plant to like express
[12:10.710 --> 12:13.710]  a lot of terpene defense mechanisms?
[12:13.710 --> 12:18.710]  You know, I think natural environments absolutely contribute in that way.
[12:18.710 --> 12:24.710]  I don't necessarily think that the size of the plant has a lot to do with the terpene
[12:24.710 --> 12:25.710]  profiles, you know.
[12:25.710 --> 12:28.710]  I think the environmental conditions absolutely can.
[12:29.510 --> 12:34.510]  I mean, I've seen guys growing in Hawaii and, you know, Hawaii's got 11 of the 13 different
[12:34.510 --> 12:35.510]  climate zones on planet earth.
[12:35.510 --> 12:39.510]  So if you're growing, you know, down in Ocean View and you're at 4,000 feet, you know, you're
[12:39.510 --> 12:44.510]  up in some cold weather versus guys who are growing, you know, 1,000 feet, 750, you know,
[12:44.510 --> 12:48.510]  it's hot, you know, Malchusite or it just kind of depends.
[12:48.510 --> 12:55.510]  And I think that has more of an influence, especially over trichome size and development.
[12:56.310 --> 12:59.310]  You know, you see the stuff that's grown in the colder weather and it seems to be a smaller
[12:59.310 --> 13:02.310]  plant, but it seems to have more trichome coverage.
[13:02.310 --> 13:07.310]  But, you know, it's all in balance, you know.
[13:07.310 --> 13:13.310]  So I guess to go back to the single source part of it is, single sourcing is again, growing
[13:13.310 --> 13:16.310]  it, growing your own and using one material.
[13:16.310 --> 13:21.310]  And I think that it was that kind of definition entered the lexicon because you had a lot
[13:21.310 --> 13:24.310]  of people making BHO.
[13:25.110 --> 13:28.110]  And in that process, they're pulling in from a lot of different sources.
[13:28.110 --> 13:34.110]  And, you know, in this day and age, I don't see a lot of water hashmakers drawing in and
[13:34.110 --> 13:36.110]  mixing batches from different people.
[13:36.110 --> 13:38.110]  I just don't see that.
[13:38.110 --> 13:40.110]  Like to me, it's not kind of like a misnomer.
[13:40.110 --> 13:42.110]  It doesn't really even happen.
[13:42.110 --> 13:44.110]  So we don't need a definition to define it.
[13:44.110 --> 13:47.110]  So I think single source, when people are talking about it, is generally you're saying
[13:47.110 --> 13:49.110]  that I'm growing it and I'm washing it.
[13:49.110 --> 13:52.110]  You know, this is coming from me and my farm.
[13:52.910 --> 13:55.910]  You know, that can represent your terroir or your growing method.
[13:55.910 --> 13:58.910]  So it's important to delineate that.
[13:58.910 --> 14:04.910]  Another little acronym we use is WPFF, whole plant fresh frozen.
[14:04.910 --> 14:09.910]  Long time ago when I was teaching myself to make hash, we didn't use whole, we used to
[14:09.910 --> 14:13.910]  throw the trim out and we didn't make hash when I first started.
[14:13.910 --> 14:17.910]  And then we figured out, hey, we can actually wash this trim and get hash back.
[14:17.910 --> 14:19.910]  And we didn't ever think about using flowers.
[14:20.710 --> 14:22.710]  That didn't come until much later down the road.
[14:22.710 --> 14:29.710]  And I think that was also a huge function of the marketplace because hash was, you know,
[14:29.710 --> 14:31.710]  10, 20 bucks a gram.
[14:31.710 --> 14:33.710]  None of it was full melt.
[14:33.710 --> 14:37.710]  I guess it was full melt, but it wasn't like dabble stuff you wanted to dab.
[14:37.710 --> 14:41.710]  And just quickly kind of ballpark what year we're talking about.
[14:41.710 --> 14:45.710]  I'm talking like, so when I was 18, I'm going to date myself here.
[14:45.710 --> 14:47.710]  This is like mid 90s.
[14:48.510 --> 14:52.510]  And I started making hash probably late 90s, early 2000s.
[14:52.510 --> 14:59.510]  And, you know, to me, the evolution of hash is really kind of a cool story.
[14:59.510 --> 15:03.510]  And were you doing ice water or were you doing like dry sift at that time?
[15:03.510 --> 15:05.510]  No, no ice water.
[15:05.510 --> 15:07.510]  Ice water.
[15:07.510 --> 15:11.510]  And I mean, there was dry sift, but I was never putting anything on a screen.
[15:11.510 --> 15:14.510]  It was like, hey, look at all the trichomes that were left over and we'd gather those up.
[15:14.510 --> 15:17.510]  But, you know, washing came a little bit later.
[15:18.310 --> 15:21.310]  And again, it was something that we did with the scrap stuff.
[15:21.310 --> 15:24.310]  It wasn't anything that we were putting, you know, whole gardens into.
[15:24.310 --> 15:30.310]  And I think it was only after the flour rosin kind of explosion
[15:30.310 --> 15:34.310]  that people really got turned on to solventless and started turning away from BHO more.
[15:34.310 --> 15:36.310]  It became more accessible.
[15:36.310 --> 15:39.310]  And people started seeing the benefits of it.
[15:39.310 --> 15:41.310]  And the market price followed.
[15:41.310 --> 15:44.310]  I mean, when flour rosin first came out here in Washington,
[15:44.310 --> 15:47.310]  you know, it was like $50 a gram for flour rosin.
[15:48.110 --> 15:52.110]  I feel like I was one of the first people to squish an entire indoor crop.
[15:52.110 --> 15:55.110]  And it doubled the price over what I would have gotten for flours.
[15:55.110 --> 16:01.110]  So the market really needed to kind of come up to speed with understanding,
[16:01.110 --> 16:04.110]  you know, the flours were this much and I get this much hash from it.
[16:04.110 --> 16:09.110]  So those things kind of got to equal out and that's going to set the price for your hash.
[16:09.110 --> 16:16.110]  And I think that it took a lot of work by a lot of people to get the word out
[16:16.910 --> 16:20.910]  about how good hash was and to talk about it and represent it
[16:20.910 --> 16:23.910]  and put it in the right people's hands before that kind of caught on.
[16:23.910 --> 16:25.910]  So shout out to all those pioneers.
[16:25.910 --> 16:27.910]  There's too many to mention.
[16:27.910 --> 16:31.910]  But those guys did a good job of pushing the craft forward.
[16:31.910 --> 16:33.910]  And I remember making that old school hash.
[16:33.910 --> 16:36.910]  And we'd scoop it and just dry it.
[16:36.910 --> 16:40.910]  I'd put it on a piece of parchment and then just put it on a plate
[16:40.910 --> 16:45.910]  and set it on top of one of my T5s and just let it dry over the course of whatever.
[16:46.710 --> 16:48.710]  And at different points, you'd go and feel it and it was just gooey.
[16:48.710 --> 16:51.710]  After a couple days, it would turn to like goo.
[16:51.710 --> 16:52.710]  And people wanted that.
[16:52.710 --> 16:54.710]  When people saw that, they're like, man, I want it like that.
[16:54.710 --> 16:56.710]  And I couldn't sell it to them because it wasn't quite dry yet.
[16:56.710 --> 16:59.710]  And if you sold it to them, in a week they'd call you back and say,
[16:59.710 --> 17:02.710]  man, I broke it open and the inside was rotten.
[17:02.710 --> 17:09.710]  So that's, I think, where the process came in for people to start doing things
[17:09.710 --> 17:13.710]  like Matt Ries gets the credit for the Microplane.
[17:14.510 --> 17:18.510]  To even come up with that was an effort in how we can dry it
[17:18.510 --> 17:23.510]  and keep it looking gooey and sappy and make it eventually dab-able.
[17:25.510 --> 17:29.510]  So that whole evolution has taken some really cool steps
[17:29.510 --> 17:34.510]  on how we learn to handle the hash, handle the rosin,
[17:34.510 --> 17:37.510]  getting it out, getting it cold, breaking it up small, doing it fast,
[17:37.510 --> 17:40.510]  keeping it cool so it doesn't oxidize.
[17:41.310 --> 17:46.310]  The curve on this thing in the last 20 years has just went whoop!
[17:46.310 --> 17:49.310]  And the level of hash right now is insane.
[17:49.310 --> 17:52.310]  There's some kids out there making just all kinds of cool stuff
[17:52.310 --> 17:55.310]  and learning how to manipulate the material post-processing.
[17:57.310 --> 18:04.310]  I watched an interview of Brandon from 3rd Gen and he was saying
[18:04.310 --> 18:07.310]  he doesn't like to keep doing manipulations of the hash.
[18:07.310 --> 18:10.310]  And I'm with that 100%.
[18:11.110 --> 18:14.110]  I want minimal, I grow the stuff really good,
[18:14.110 --> 18:17.110]  separate it and give it to the end user.
[18:17.110 --> 18:20.110]  Let's not play with it and do too much treatments to it.
[18:20.110 --> 18:23.110]  But on the other hand, I think some of those treatments are really fun
[18:23.110 --> 18:26.110]  and it's neat because you're able to learn different things
[18:26.110 --> 18:31.110]  about the rosin and how it works and how it reacts to different things.
[18:33.110 --> 18:37.110]  For me, that's kind of a neat aspect of everything developing.
[18:37.910 --> 18:40.910]  The solventless game has just exploded.
[18:40.910 --> 18:43.910]  At one point, I had stores up here telling me,
[18:43.910 --> 18:46.910]  BHOs, we don't even want to buy your 6R.
[18:46.910 --> 18:48.910]  This was early medical days.
[18:48.910 --> 18:50.910]  Of course, it was very foolish of them,
[18:50.910 --> 18:54.910]  but that's how huge BHO was there for a minute.
[18:54.910 --> 18:57.910]  And now I feel like it's kind of collapsing in on itself
[18:57.910 --> 19:01.910]  with this explosion of solventless coming out
[19:01.910 --> 19:04.910]  and people realizing that this is such a better product to consume.
[19:05.710 --> 19:08.710]  Can you just quickly talk about the evolution of the STAR system
[19:08.710 --> 19:11.710]  and what 6R is versus 5?
[19:11.710 --> 19:14.710]  I'm the worst guy to explain this.
[19:14.710 --> 19:19.710]  It's my understanding the STAR system was derived in Oakland.
[19:22.710 --> 19:24.710]  It's kind of needed, right?
[19:24.710 --> 19:27.710]  The end user needs to know how melty is this hash
[19:27.710 --> 19:30.710]  and one is going to be like your Nebraska no-melt.
[19:30.710 --> 19:33.710]  It's going to be high in contaminants.
[19:34.510 --> 19:39.510]  5STAR, I sell 5STAR up here in the rec market in Washington.
[19:39.510 --> 19:44.510]  And 5STAR is going to be super melty, extra high-grade hash.
[19:44.510 --> 19:47.510]  It should leave very little, if any, residue at all.
[19:49.510 --> 19:52.510]  And 6STAR should leave no residue.
[19:52.510 --> 19:57.510]  And in my opinion, the 6STAR also needs to be something a little more unique.
[19:57.510 --> 20:00.510]  It used to be just 1 through 5,
[20:00.510 --> 20:03.510]  and then I don't know where the 6STAR came on there.
[20:04.310 --> 20:06.310]  To me, if you want to claim that 6STAR,
[20:06.310 --> 20:08.310]  you really need to have a unique cultivar,
[20:08.310 --> 20:11.310]  something that you have and nobody else has.
[20:11.310 --> 20:14.310]  You can make really good, but by definition,
[20:14.310 --> 20:17.310]  it's just about the meltability and how clean the hash is.
[20:17.310 --> 20:20.310]  And generally, when we're talking about contaminant and hash,
[20:20.310 --> 20:23.310]  we're talking about plant material.
[20:23.310 --> 20:26.310]  Or as Matt Rice points out, the dust.
[20:26.310 --> 20:29.310]  Because the dust is really hard to get out,
[20:29.310 --> 20:32.310]  if not impossible to get out, just using water
[20:33.110 --> 20:35.310]  and then using a lot of the same kind of
[20:35.310 --> 20:37.310]  micron bags where we're collecting.
[20:37.310 --> 20:40.310]  So you've got to have pretty good filtration on your setup.
[20:40.310 --> 20:43.310]  And then 4STAR, again, very melty, but it's going to leave residue.
[20:43.310 --> 20:46.310]  And then you work your way down from there.
[20:46.310 --> 20:51.310]  I find just the way that I wash and run through stuff,
[20:51.310 --> 20:54.310]  I don't generally ever see 1 through 3.
[20:54.310 --> 20:58.310]  And the 4STAR to me is like cooking-grade stuff.
[20:59.310 --> 21:02.310]  And the way that we're growing and whatnot,
[21:02.310 --> 21:05.310]  we're making sure that we're handling things with incredible care.
[21:05.310 --> 21:08.310]  And I think most cultivars will throw you,
[21:08.310 --> 21:12.310]  like a certain percentage of your material that you get back
[21:12.310 --> 21:16.310]  is going to be high enough grade that you can just sell it as a 5 or 6STAR.
[21:16.310 --> 21:19.310]  And then the rest of it's going to be something that you need to rosin.
[21:19.310 --> 21:23.310]  And if you can find a cultivar that throws a higher percentage of 6STAR,
[21:23.310 --> 21:26.310]  5STAR, 6STAR, that's a great plant to have in your setup.
[21:27.310 --> 21:30.310]  And then the rest of it is going to be something that you can just
[21:30.310 --> 21:35.160]  throw in there and it's going to be a 5 or 6STAR.
[21:35.160 --> 21:38.160]  That's a great plant to have in your bag of tricks.
[21:38.160 --> 21:41.160]  So you're rosin pressing water hashed?
[21:41.160 --> 21:42.160]  Am I understanding that right?
[21:42.160 --> 21:44.160]  Yeah, that's how you make hash rosin.
[21:44.160 --> 21:45.160]  Okay.
[21:45.160 --> 21:50.160]  It's pretty simple.
[21:50.160 --> 21:53.160]  My process is we'll wash the hash material.
[21:53.160 --> 21:57.160]  And then we collect it.
[21:57.160 --> 21:58.160]  And when you wash,
[21:58.160 --> 22:04.160]  are you consistent with like the different micron bag sizes or like,
[22:04.160 --> 22:05.160]  depending on the cultivar,
[22:05.160 --> 22:10.160]  you know that you're going to use this set of bags versus that combination of
[22:10.160 --> 22:11.160]  bags?
[22:11.160 --> 22:12.160]  Yeah. If it's something new,
[22:12.160 --> 22:16.160]  I'll throw all the bags in there on the first run just to see where stuff
[22:16.160 --> 22:19.160]  lands and see where I can move the bags around, you know,
[22:19.160 --> 22:22.160]  because it'll tell you pretty much right away, Hey, okay, this is,
[22:22.160 --> 22:25.160]  this is where the good stuff starts. And if it's good for, you know,
[22:25.160 --> 22:27.160]  the one 20 is beautiful and the 90 is beautiful.
[22:27.160 --> 22:30.160]  Then you may remove the one 20 bag and just collect it in the 90,
[22:30.160 --> 22:32.160]  but keep your one 50 and there's your filter.
[22:32.160 --> 22:34.160]  Sometimes you need that one 20 is your filter.
[22:34.160 --> 22:35.160]  Cause it doesn't come back that great.
[22:35.160 --> 22:39.160]  And that's what's going to make your your 90 you better. You know,
[22:39.160 --> 22:40.160]  I have a one Oh seven bag.
[22:40.160 --> 22:44.160]  I generally just don't use it because it's it's clean enough in the,
[22:44.160 --> 22:46.160]  in the deal. And I can combine it in the 90.
[22:46.160 --> 22:50.160]  And when we collect, I'm generally pulling the 90 you,
[22:50.160 --> 22:53.160]  and I'll I'll see that and then let it air dry.
[22:53.160 --> 22:55.160]  And then the, you know, higher grades, sometimes the one 20,
[22:55.160 --> 22:57.160]  if it looks great, that'll happen as well.
[22:57.160 --> 23:01.160]  But other times that will get collected with the 70 you or the 40 you.
[23:01.160 --> 23:03.160]  And, and that will go on the freeze dryer.
[23:03.160 --> 23:05.160]  And then when it comes out of the freeze dryer,
[23:05.160 --> 23:08.160]  then we put it into smaller bags.
[23:08.160 --> 23:11.160]  Shout out mash bags. Those are my homies that I get my stuff from.
[23:11.160 --> 23:14.160]  And, and we, we flop those. And then we put them in.
[23:14.160 --> 23:17.160]  I get parchment from black label paper company down there in a,
[23:17.160 --> 23:18.160]  I believe they're in Laguna County.
[23:19.160 --> 23:22.160]  They actually send me really dope pre-cut liners for my freeze dry
[23:22.160 --> 23:25.160]  trays, non-bleached pre-cut liners. So I pour the hash in there,
[23:25.160 --> 23:28.160]  throw it in the freeze dryer for the cycle, take it out.
[23:28.160 --> 23:29.160]  We put it in the mash,
[23:29.160 --> 23:34.160]  a rosin bags wrap it up in the in the paper and put it into a low
[23:34.160 --> 23:37.160]  temp plates. Use low temp plates. It's nice because it's a,
[23:37.160 --> 23:39.160]  it's got a manual control.
[23:39.160 --> 23:42.160]  Whereas I think the hydraulic control is a little bit more complicated
[23:42.160 --> 23:43.160]  and it's a little bit more complicated.
[23:43.160 --> 23:45.160]  But it's a little bit easier to use.
[23:45.160 --> 23:46.160]  It's got a manual control.
[23:46.160 --> 23:48.160]  Whereas I think the hydraulic stuff, you know,
[23:48.160 --> 23:52.160]  you just don't have as gentle control over it and you really want to
[23:52.160 --> 23:54.160]  like ease into pressing of the hash.
[23:54.160 --> 23:57.160]  So you get it to kind of put a little pressure on there and heat it up
[23:57.160 --> 24:01.160]  so that it will melt it and kind of get it all to a one consistency.
[24:01.160 --> 24:04.160]  And then you can apply print gentle pressure and,
[24:04.160 --> 24:06.160]  and it will push out through the bags and then run out.
[24:06.160 --> 24:09.160]  If you, if you impact it too hard,
[24:09.160 --> 24:11.160]  it doesn't give it that time to heat up and then you end up blowing out
[24:11.160 --> 24:12.160]  the little bags.
[24:12.160 --> 24:17.360]  bags and then you have a mess and nobody wants to deal with that. You lose hash and time and just,
[24:17.360 --> 24:23.120]  you know, and then yeah, once it comes off, you know, it's a collection and some people are doing
[24:23.120 --> 24:29.600]  cold cures or whipping it. You can collect that and put it in, wrap it up in deals and keep it
[24:29.600 --> 24:34.320]  under heat for a certain time and then that will give you the consistency to put it into solventless
[24:34.320 --> 24:38.880]  pens, which I think is a really cool innovation. I'm not super into pens, but you know, they have
[24:38.880 --> 24:45.920]  their applications. But yeah, that's how we press the hash and it's a great process. It
[24:45.920 --> 24:50.720]  cleans stuff up, you know, if there's any kind of contaminant left in the hash, it doesn't make it
[24:50.720 --> 24:55.680]  through those other bags that we're using. And those other bags, I use a, it's called a bullet
[24:55.680 --> 25:01.440]  proof tech. Not sure who invented that technology or that method, but essentially we put the hash
[25:01.440 --> 25:07.520]  into one bag, one micron bag, and then we slide it into another micron bag. Generally, I'm using a
[25:07.520 --> 25:15.360]  37U and then a 120U on the outside. And that keeps it from having blowouts and allows the
[25:16.480 --> 25:24.960]  finished product to travel through nice and easy. And do you find kind of gold at each micron size,
[25:24.960 --> 25:33.600]  like for certain cultivars, like the 120 is something that you appreciate, whereas for
[25:33.600 --> 25:40.720]  something else you don't want the 120, but you want the 90 or the, you know, or is it kind of...
[25:40.720 --> 25:41.280]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[25:44.080 --> 25:49.040]  Like, are the small, is the smaller micron size necessarily always better? I mean, I know it has
[25:49.040 --> 25:56.000]  less impurities, but... Actually, yeah, generally, generally the 90U is where it's at. I mean,
[25:56.000 --> 26:01.840]  here's just to kind of give you an idea and not necessarily in yield though. You know,
[26:01.840 --> 26:05.600]  some sativas that have really small heads on their deals, you know, they're going to blow up
[26:05.600 --> 26:10.240]  in a smaller bag and it's going to be actually pretty decent hash. So don't make the mistake
[26:10.240 --> 26:13.840]  in thinking that the smaller micron is always garbage. If you're working with a cultivar
[26:14.480 --> 26:18.080]  that creates a smaller head, then that's where you want to collect it. But generally, we're not
[26:18.080 --> 26:24.400]  trying to get those because, here's the visual, okay? You've got that head of the trichome,
[26:25.360 --> 26:32.560]  and just like a basketball versus a tennis ball, right? We're trying to get the juice out of that
[26:32.560 --> 26:39.360]  grape. So if it's a small one, it's not going to have a lot of juice in relation to the cuticle
[26:39.360 --> 26:45.920]  size, the outside of it. Whereas if it's a bigger ball, you've got more of that juice inside relative
[26:45.920 --> 26:51.840]  to the outside deal. Does that make sense? So those are going to produce a lot more for you
[26:52.640 --> 26:57.760]  in terms of the hash rosin, obviously. But also with the collections, you're just getting,
[26:57.760 --> 27:02.880]  it's more meltiness. Those smaller ones are not going to melt as well as the bigger heads.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.800]  And I'm using big here, but you know, they're all also very teeny. But yeah, you definitely want
[27:09.760 --> 27:14.800]  larger heads and those are, you know, going to come out at the 120, 90, sometimes the 70U.
[27:15.680 --> 27:21.280]  But usually the 90 is kind of the sweet spot for that. You know, if you're rolling stuff
[27:21.280 --> 27:26.240]  into joints, you know, if you're infusing material, maybe you want something that's a little
[27:27.520 --> 27:35.360]  more chalky, has a little more of those, you know, smaller grades, because it's not going to be quite
[27:35.360 --> 27:40.160]  as sticky in the joint. You know, I'm always, I'd rather have the sticky stuff in my joint,
[27:40.160 --> 27:44.880]  but I'm just saying as a matter of practical application or in a commercial setting even,
[27:45.680 --> 27:50.480]  that's going to be important that you can infuse it into your pre-rolled joints or whatever that
[27:51.200 --> 27:55.440]  you're creating there. So that's kind of how that works on the bags and stuff.
[27:57.040 --> 28:02.480]  Is there anything that comes out of the water hash that you don't feel like you need to press
[28:02.480 --> 28:06.400]  the rosin out of, or is it just mandatory these days that that's just the step you go?
[28:06.400 --> 28:11.680]  No, absolutely. That, you know, generally it's the first or second pull of the 90U
[28:12.560 --> 28:16.960]  on our hash cultivars is what's providing that six star. And I would prefer not to rosin it,
[28:16.960 --> 28:22.640]  because I lose yield. So when it's throwing that really high grade stuff, yeah, that does not get
[28:22.640 --> 28:28.400]  rosin. That to me, that's kind of sacrilegious. Some people like it. Me, I'm old school. I want
[28:28.400 --> 28:34.960]  real good hash, not rosin, and I can press it, finger press it, or press it in some parchment
[28:34.960 --> 28:40.160]  and make it dab-able. And this kind of goes to a little bit of what you were asking, Peter,
[28:40.160 --> 28:45.920]  with the head size as well. So how does that correlate into your dab temperature?
[28:46.720 --> 28:52.000]  So BHO guys can really kind of take a higher temperature that BHO can withstand. I don't
[28:52.000 --> 28:57.120]  know why, probably because it's got hydrocarbon still left in it. So it can take a higher
[28:57.120 --> 29:03.040]  temperature nail. But then the hash rosin, you want to bring that temperature down a little bit.
[29:04.000 --> 29:11.040]  And again, hash rosin can take a higher temperature than the six star. So for some reason,
[29:11.040 --> 29:16.960]  it doesn't have, again, it doesn't have the heads on it, so it's just the juice. And you're going
[29:16.960 --> 29:22.720]  to have less residue with the hash rosin. But you got to lower it if you're going to dab the straight
[29:22.720 --> 29:26.960]  hash, or you're going to get, it's going to burn on you a little bit if you try to dab it at those
[29:26.960 --> 29:32.960]  higher temperatures. So better to keep it a little bit more low even for the six star stuff. That's
[29:33.440 --> 29:38.000]  pretty important for people that really want to enjoy it. It would really suck to buy a gram of
[29:38.000 --> 29:45.200]  six star and hit it at too high of a temp and miss that really ultimate experience of just getting
[29:45.200 --> 29:53.520]  turps slapped by some good hash. So can you share some temperature ranges for those? I know BHO was
[29:53.520 --> 29:59.680]  crazy. I want to say over 600 degrees. Yeah, we used to say hit it when it's red hot.
[30:00.160 --> 30:08.080]  Right. And then like hash rosin is probably what in the 400s? Yeah. So for me on my email,
[30:08.960 --> 30:15.760]  I like to hit my hash rosin 450 to 500. I use Celsius downstairs. So it's like
[30:16.800 --> 30:24.720]  230-ish up to 250. That's about as hot as I want to go. And then if I'm dabbing six star,
[30:25.440 --> 30:32.000]  I want it even less. I want it 450 or lower. And that's how I roll.
[30:32.000 --> 30:38.480]  Gotcha. Thanks for sharing. Yeah. It's all about the turps. You're going to get people like,
[30:38.480 --> 30:44.880]  I don't see. And for me, if you're hitting it and there's smoke coming out or vapor coming up
[30:44.880 --> 30:50.560]  immediately before you put the cap on, it's too hot. There should be no vapor when you're hitting
[30:50.560 --> 30:54.320]  it straight away. And then when you, I always tell people like you hit, don't start until the
[30:54.320 --> 30:58.640]  caps on. And then once that cap hits it and it goes milk white, that's when you know you got
[30:58.640 --> 31:07.680]  the right temperature. So with the single source, is that, I mean, yeah, there's farm specific,
[31:07.680 --> 31:12.880]  but do you ever get down to plant specific? Like, do you ever find one plant in the lot? It's just
[31:12.880 --> 31:18.560]  like, we can't mix this with the rest, even though they're all the same variety or? No, no, that
[31:18.560 --> 31:23.600]  would just be, I mean, it would have to be a huge plant. I'm washing. Yeah. You know, I, it,
[31:23.600 --> 31:30.320]  there's got to be, I might do that in my, in my backyard. I've got little bags, you know,
[31:30.320 --> 31:38.080]  and I can play and do that. But on the big scale, I want to wash. I think we're running like 1500
[31:38.080 --> 31:44.480]  grams per cycle. You know, so it's, it's, it's gotta be like, you know, like a pound of dried,
[31:45.120 --> 31:48.960]  you know, to make it, to make it worth your time, you know, and, and, and ice and effort
[31:48.960 --> 31:54.800]  and everything else, you know, I want to, I want to get it all in there. So yeah, I think that's
[31:54.800 --> 31:59.840]  super important. So recreationally, that's where you're setting that, that pound of dry material
[31:59.840 --> 32:04.480]  for? Yeah. Yeah. Honestly, we're not, we're not washing much dry. Most of it's fresh frozen.
[32:04.480 --> 32:09.120]  So it comes out to generally like, and again, depending on the size, sometimes you get stuff
[32:09.120 --> 32:14.400]  that's just bigger and it won't fit in the, in the pre-wash bag. But anywhere from, you know,
[32:14.400 --> 32:20.400]  a thousand to 1500 grams in, in, in one, you know, I mean, I use, I like to use the ice cube bags,
[32:20.400 --> 32:25.120]  shadow ice extracts. But I've also used the bigger tote bags. And in those ones,
[32:25.120 --> 32:31.760]  you're putting more like 2000 grams in. I think using, using multiple bags in your washers is
[32:31.760 --> 32:35.920]  a little better. Or if you're, if you're even hand stirring, I know a lot of guys these days
[32:36.880 --> 32:41.680]  like to do it like Frenchie style, where they're not using a bag at all. I like to use a bag,
[32:41.680 --> 32:46.400]  even if I'm hand stirring, I just think I get another cycle or two out of it before it goes bad.
[32:47.440 --> 32:55.360]  And to me that counts. So, so do you only hand stir? Like, do you use a paddle or do you also
[32:55.360 --> 33:01.280]  use a machine like a washer? I use both. I use both. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and kind of in,
[33:01.280 --> 33:08.400]  in what scenario would you do one versus the other? So I, I per, personally, I prefer to do
[33:08.400 --> 33:14.480]  like your first wash or two with, or your first cycle or two with the paddle. And when you do that,
[33:15.280 --> 33:19.840]  you know, generally, if you're doing it right, you should get most of your yield in those first two
[33:19.840 --> 33:24.400]  cycles. If that water's cold, if everything's set, you'll get the first one. If not, you know,
[33:24.400 --> 33:27.280]  I can almost predict the second one that's going to come. If you're washing something,
[33:27.280 --> 33:32.400]  you know, it's going to dump. And then after those first two cycles, I'm not looking so much
[33:32.400 --> 33:37.440]  for that cuvee anymore. I'm not looking for the six star anymore. It's just not going to be there.
[33:38.480 --> 33:42.960]  So at that point, I know I'm going to rosin it so I can remove some bags. I can let them all
[33:42.960 --> 33:48.000]  collect in, in, in a, in a smaller bag. And then it just makes less work for me. And I know I'm
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.840]  going to, I'm going to squish it anyways. So it really doesn't matter. And then those folks are
[33:51.840 --> 33:57.440]  getting that full spectrum. So you're getting 90 in your rosin, you know, and you're getting 96
[33:57.440 --> 34:01.440]  star, you know, they don't want, you know, nobody wants to just say, man, I pulled out the 40 and
[34:01.440 --> 34:05.120]  squish that for you. I mean, nobody wants that. You know, they want, they want, they want the 90,
[34:05.120 --> 34:08.640]  they want the 120 in there. They want that full spectrum. And interestingly enough,
[34:09.200 --> 34:16.240]  we used to run this mango cush. And I swear to you, I washed it in the 120, the 90 and the 70
[34:16.240 --> 34:21.600]  all smelled different. One had, one had a certain smell to it. I had more of an apple. The other
[34:21.600 --> 34:25.840]  one had more of a, like a pineapple. And then you combine them and they had this mango thing,
[34:25.840 --> 34:32.320]  but you know, I don't know why that is, but you know, maybe it's, maybe it's the different,
[34:32.320 --> 34:37.040]  the different recipe of the terpene on those different size heads or just the, the, the
[34:37.040 --> 34:41.680]  concentration of it. But you know, there's something to that. So when you, when you are
[34:41.680 --> 34:45.520]  making a hash rosin for me, anyways, it's important to, to make sure that they're getting,
[34:45.520 --> 34:48.800]  they're getting all the good stuff too. Not just getting like the leftovers. That's not cool.
[34:48.800 --> 34:56.000]  Nobody wants that. Do you find a difference in, in washing like, like, like the density of the
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.720]  bud of the flower? Do you find a difference when they're, when they're denser as opposed to
[35:02.480 --> 35:10.080]  sparser or, or? Yeah, absolutely. And, and I think some folks have even done a couple tricks when
[35:10.080 --> 35:14.320]  they're growing to go ahead and let their plants revert a little bit so that they're not getting
[35:14.320 --> 35:21.360]  as tight. But again, we're really meticulous about the process when we're harvesting it.
[35:22.720 --> 35:27.440]  You know, we, we cut the plants down whole, de-leaf them beforehand, cut them whole, bring
[35:27.440 --> 35:32.880]  them in. And then my guys are in there. I got one guy or two guys snipping off all the big leaves,
[35:32.880 --> 35:36.320]  anything that doesn't have sugar on it. And then they hand it down to the next guy. And that guy's
[35:36.320 --> 35:42.000]  actually going through every little bud, all the way up and taking them down to their smallest
[35:42.000 --> 35:49.280]  little piece, you know, by the, by the stem. So we're not cutting and damaging the leaf material,
[35:49.280 --> 35:54.160]  but by the stem and, and just breaking it down super small, because some of the stuff we grow
[35:54.160 --> 35:59.840]  is, is more tight. The hamma-hamma grows big, huge monster nugs. And if we washed them as such,
[35:59.840 --> 36:05.760]  you, you just wouldn't get that stuff out of them. So again, I think that you can overcome those
[36:05.760 --> 36:13.760]  issues by doing that, you know. And our business model is really about the hash. So we don't care
[36:13.760 --> 36:17.520]  so much about what the flower looks like, you know, because it really doesn't matter. We want
[36:17.520 --> 36:22.480]  to know that it's producing the hash and that the hash looks great. Yeah, I was just curious if the,
[36:22.480 --> 36:26.240]  the hash production affected your breeding and your selections at all. But if you're breaking
[36:26.240 --> 36:30.880]  it down like that, then you're just... No, but, but, but absolutely that too. I mean, you know, there's
[36:30.880 --> 36:35.280]  stuff that, there's stuff that throws and there's stuff that doesn't. And you know, when you're,
[36:35.280 --> 36:39.360]  when you're selecting for hash, you know, I mean, you can get your heart broken, you know, you think
[36:39.360 --> 36:44.400]  you got something and, and, and if you wash it, it doesn't, I mean, I've washed, I've washed a couple
[36:44.400 --> 36:50.000]  things over the years that just crushed me, you know. Nikiti came out and we were going to do a
[36:50.000 --> 36:57.040]  collab for a High Times Cup long time ago. And I had some cherry pie that I thought was, man,
[36:57.040 --> 37:01.280]  this stuff is great. And we're going to crush it. Nothing smells like this. And we washed it and got
[37:01.280 --> 37:05.920]  like four dabs out of it. We're like thousand dollar dabs, you know, it was, it was two lights
[37:05.920 --> 37:10.080]  worth of, you know, and at that time we were getting, you know, 35 a pound. So that was, that
[37:10.080 --> 37:15.760]  was a huge kick to the nuts. But you know, lessons learned. Everybody knows now, don't wash a cherry
[37:15.760 --> 37:21.840]  pie. I mean, ask anybody. And that's some fragrant flour too. So that, that would be super disappointing.
[37:21.840 --> 37:25.680]  Yeah. Well, you know, and, and again, this was, this was, I brought that pie up here
[37:26.640 --> 37:34.160]  long time ago. And, you know, I think that we're learning more about plants and we're learning more
[37:34.160 --> 37:40.400]  about the differences, you know, mono terpenes and secondary terpenes and being able to identify,
[37:40.400 --> 37:44.640]  hey, this plant smokes great in a joint. It's not going to hash, you know what I mean? The
[37:44.640 --> 37:49.600]  blueberry smokes great in joints. You burn it all the way down to the last thing. Ooh, blueberries,
[37:49.600 --> 37:56.000]  wash it. It just, it's not the same. It doesn't give you any yield. You know, and conversely,
[37:56.000 --> 38:02.640]  a lot of those mono terp flowers, I won't smoke them. They're gross. Roll a joint. And it's like
[38:02.640 --> 38:07.440]  first hits good. Second hit is rubbish. They make good bong hits. They look good in a bag,
[38:07.440 --> 38:14.160]  but the terps aren't there. But if you wash them, whole different story. So, you know, I think it's
[38:14.160 --> 38:17.760]  important to know your cultivars and, and, and know, you know, what you're, what you're searching
[38:17.760 --> 38:22.080]  for. You know, I know Arcai has been breeding a lot. He's got some great hash strains, but he's
[38:22.080 --> 38:26.560]  also got some lines that he is specifically breeding for those secondary terps, you know,
[38:26.560 --> 38:31.520]  and he doesn't care if they wash or not, but, you know, knowing the difference, it's just,
[38:31.520 --> 38:35.520]  that's an important part of, of, of the business and, and the experience as well.
[38:37.760 --> 38:39.360]  So Fred, can you hear us?
[38:39.520 --> 38:45.120]  All right. Fred, Fred is down here in LA with me. I feel, I felt like we had a,
[38:45.120 --> 38:47.120]  we skewed to the Pacific Northwest.
[38:49.600 --> 38:51.200]  You gotta level it out. We gotta have balance.
[38:52.000 --> 39:00.320]  Right. So, so with your, I mean, because you breed, so like when you're breeding for hash,
[39:00.320 --> 39:04.800]  like, can you talk about some breeding techniques that you use?
[39:05.360 --> 39:14.160]  Or like what were kind of the iterative tweaks that you were making to the cultivars be like,
[39:15.920 --> 39:21.360]  you know, this is, this is not quite what I want. I need to add a little of this into the lineage
[39:21.360 --> 39:27.360]  and see how that, you know, like what are you looking for in a, in a hash cultivar?
[39:27.360 --> 39:29.360]  for in a hash cultivar?
[39:30.320 --> 39:33.440]  So for me, sorry, I'm gonna take a dab here.
[39:33.440 --> 39:34.480]  Yeah, no, look.
[39:38.970 --> 39:40.690]  I mean, it's terps, it's terps, terps, terps,
[39:40.690 --> 39:41.990]  but it's also production.
[39:43.450 --> 39:45.090]  It's gotta put up the numbers
[39:45.090 --> 39:46.590]  or it's just not gonna work.
[39:47.610 --> 39:50.910]  You're gonna get absolutely crushed in a garden
[39:50.910 --> 39:55.210]  if you try to wash something that's got 2% return.
[39:56.090 --> 40:00.370]  Anything under 3%, in our market up here with the prices,
[40:00.370 --> 40:02.090]  you're gonna lose money.
[40:02.090 --> 40:04.850]  So you have to have something that can put up numbers.
[40:05.970 --> 40:10.310]  But I also look at, obviously it's terps,
[40:10.310 --> 40:11.790]  stuff has gotta taste good.
[40:12.930 --> 40:17.590]  Beyond that, there's different qualities to the end hash.
[40:17.590 --> 40:20.990]  So some of these cultivars might actually throw
[40:20.990 --> 40:22.610]  a lot of hash, but to me,
[40:22.610 --> 40:25.010]  the hash has got the wrong quality to it.
[40:25.010 --> 40:27.870]  It doesn't have enough of the sappiness that I want.
[40:28.830 --> 40:30.790]  It can be almost too chalky.
[40:30.790 --> 40:33.710]  And that's something that I would select against.
[40:34.630 --> 40:37.030]  And again, no, I wouldn't select something that's too sappy.
[40:37.030 --> 40:39.910]  I mean, that's why we can't wash CBD strains in general.
[40:39.910 --> 40:42.750]  And I've tried breeding CBD strains
[40:42.750 --> 40:44.870]  because I think they've got crazy terps.
[40:44.870 --> 40:47.570]  Some of the cherry terps and CBD strains are the best.
[40:50.070 --> 40:52.190]  But when I crossed them two things,
[40:53.150 --> 40:56.930]  I ran them into like my alien cush.
[40:58.390 --> 41:02.230]  And I just couldn't get them to grab hold.
[41:02.230 --> 41:04.530]  I couldn't get a hash producer
[41:04.530 --> 41:06.870]  that still maintained that cherry terpene.
[41:07.710 --> 41:11.270]  So sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't.
[41:11.270 --> 41:13.710]  To me, coffee does really good with making hash
[41:13.710 --> 41:14.790]  and it breeds really well.
[41:14.790 --> 41:17.630]  It crosses over and it makes other things good with hash.
[41:18.550 --> 41:21.990]  So it's all trial and error and selecting males
[41:21.990 --> 41:23.350]  and doing all these things.
[41:24.510 --> 41:25.710]  It's an educated guess.
[41:25.710 --> 41:29.070]  And you really don't know until you've ran it yourself.
[41:29.070 --> 41:31.110]  And that's kind of part of my whole process
[41:31.110 --> 41:32.310]  as we do the breeding.
[41:33.430 --> 41:37.270]  We select the methodology and do the farming ourselves.
[41:37.270 --> 41:38.310]  We're making the hash.
[41:38.310 --> 41:40.710]  So we're seeing every bit of it
[41:40.710 --> 41:43.470]  and kind of having a hand in every bit of it.
[41:43.470 --> 41:46.910]  And that to me helps us to orchestrate things
[41:46.910 --> 41:49.790]  a little bit better and to know what we're looking for.
[41:49.790 --> 41:53.150]  And on our farm out here in the rec market,
[41:53.150 --> 41:54.430]  it's purely hash.
[41:55.350 --> 41:58.670]  We cannot afford because of the overhead and the tax
[41:58.670 --> 42:00.230]  and everything, it's kind of crazy.
[42:00.230 --> 42:02.470]  We just can't afford to even put out flowers.
[42:03.530 --> 42:05.310]  So everything's gotta be a hasher.
[42:07.190 --> 42:09.110]  And it's gotta be able to finish
[42:09.110 --> 42:11.650]  if we're running it out in the yard under full sun
[42:11.650 --> 42:14.190]  without any cover, it's gotta be able to finish quick.
[42:14.190 --> 42:18.230]  We run, shout out Green Source in Oregon,
[42:18.230 --> 42:20.750]  Green Source, we run their pinkleberry.
[42:20.750 --> 42:23.310]  And the thing is like-
[42:23.310 --> 42:24.550]  That's Nick, right?
[42:24.550 --> 42:25.670]  Yeah.
[42:25.670 --> 42:29.030]  And it's a lightning fast finisher outside
[42:29.030 --> 42:31.110]  and it makes great hash, it dumps.
[42:31.110 --> 42:33.810]  It's got kind of a really unique flavor to it.
[42:35.590 --> 42:37.230]  And I can mix that one,
[42:37.230 --> 42:38.990]  I can blend it with different things on the farm
[42:38.990 --> 42:40.030]  if I need to.
[42:40.030 --> 42:42.430]  And that's kind of the interesting thing
[42:42.430 --> 42:44.150]  is being able to do blends as well.
[42:44.150 --> 42:46.270]  And I'm getting into that more and more
[42:46.270 --> 42:49.310]  as we're trying to find more things to fill the yard
[42:49.310 --> 42:50.150]  and different flavors.
[42:50.150 --> 42:52.810]  I feel like we've got a really good stable of plants.
[42:54.230 --> 42:55.470]  Well, when you're able to breed it in-house,
[42:55.470 --> 42:57.710]  it's, I don't know, it's more fun, it's more safe.
[42:57.710 --> 43:01.350]  It's dangerous bringing stuff back in from other places.
[43:01.350 --> 43:05.030]  You know, I'm a share, I share cuts with my people.
[43:05.030 --> 43:07.430]  And, you know, sometimes I ask for it back
[43:07.430 --> 43:10.110]  and I get more than I bargained for.
[43:10.110 --> 43:13.670]  So being able to breed stuff in-house is way better.
[43:13.670 --> 43:14.910]  You know what I'm saying?
[43:16.470 --> 43:19.390]  So if you're going broke under a 3% return,
[43:19.390 --> 43:21.710]  what's like the average ballpark?
[43:21.710 --> 43:23.910]  I mean, I don't want to pick on too much of your IP,
[43:23.910 --> 43:27.310]  but what's sustainable?
[43:27.310 --> 43:30.950]  My good ones, well, again, 3%, 2%,
[43:30.950 --> 43:32.790]  you're probably breaking even.
[43:32.790 --> 43:35.390]  You know, I'm probably, I probably like, okay,
[43:35.390 --> 43:38.390]  that's what the flowers would have got me, you know?
[43:38.390 --> 43:41.070]  But once you get up into four and 5%,
[43:41.070 --> 43:43.750]  that's when I can breathe, you know?
[43:43.750 --> 43:46.790]  And I've got a couple that will give me even more than 5%.
[43:46.790 --> 43:48.670]  My hamma hamma will give me five and a half
[43:48.670 --> 43:50.590]  after I squish it, you know?
[43:50.750 --> 43:52.190]  It also gives me some six.
[43:53.950 --> 43:55.790]  But, you know, that one right there is like,
[43:55.790 --> 43:58.430]  and it's fast, it finishes, it crushes.
[44:00.990 --> 44:02.430]  This is another thing, really interesting.
[44:02.430 --> 44:04.510]  I just learned this this year.
[44:04.510 --> 44:07.190]  So we had run a summer crop in our light depth
[44:08.030 --> 44:10.990]  and recorded the results.
[44:10.990 --> 44:13.630]  And then we ran a spring crop this year
[44:13.630 --> 44:16.150]  with some of the same genetics.
[44:16.150 --> 44:20.430]  And would you guess that we got an increased yield
[44:21.270 --> 44:23.190]  or a decreased yield in the springtime?
[44:25.470 --> 44:26.870]  This spring?
[44:26.870 --> 44:27.710]  Yep.
[44:27.710 --> 44:29.310]  I would think you would have got less
[44:29.310 --> 44:30.950]  because it was a weird spring.
[44:30.950 --> 44:32.390]  We got less.
[44:32.390 --> 44:34.750]  And because some of those strains,
[44:34.750 --> 44:38.030]  and it was significant, it was like by a percentage or two.
[44:38.030 --> 44:40.630]  Some of those strains were so big that it didn't matter.
[44:40.630 --> 44:41.590]  It was okay.
[44:41.590 --> 44:45.510]  You know, it would have been six, but we got four, so cool.
[44:45.510 --> 44:47.390]  But the other ones were like, man, that one was a four
[44:47.390 --> 44:49.470]  and we got two and that hurt.
[44:49.470 --> 44:53.630]  So learning that we can't run those in that scenario,
[44:54.470 --> 44:55.710]  we've got to run these other ones.
[44:55.710 --> 44:58.670]  You know, conversely, the blueberry that we ran
[44:58.670 --> 45:00.350]  did better than it's ever done.
[45:00.350 --> 45:02.110]  And I've ran that blueberry a lot.
[45:02.110 --> 45:05.750]  I've never ran a spring crop in a light depth with it though.
[45:05.750 --> 45:07.750]  And it was, so it was like, wow,
[45:07.750 --> 45:10.750]  this thing loves the spring light depth, right?
[45:10.750 --> 45:14.470]  Because I don't know, it just, it didn't need as much light.
[45:14.470 --> 45:17.190]  You know, some plants really crave that heavy heat
[45:17.190 --> 45:18.870]  and high intensity.
[45:18.910 --> 45:20.510]  Some of them don't, you know?
[45:20.510 --> 45:23.230]  So knowing how your plants are gonna react
[45:23.230 --> 45:26.270]  in those environments is another thing you've got to dial in.
[45:26.270 --> 45:28.670]  You know, and I think it's a good business model
[45:30.910 --> 45:34.190]  when you're taking especially an outdoor product
[45:34.190 --> 45:35.990]  and converting it into hash,
[45:35.990 --> 45:37.670]  because here's the thing, right?
[45:37.670 --> 45:39.710]  If you grow an indoor flower and an outdoor flower,
[45:39.710 --> 45:41.510]  which one costs more?
[45:41.510 --> 45:42.350]  The indoor flower.
[45:42.350 --> 45:43.270]  Indoor flower.
[45:43.270 --> 45:44.110]  All day.
[45:44.110 --> 45:45.310]  A lot, right?
[45:45.310 --> 45:48.030]  Once I make hash, do you know where they came from?
[45:48.910 --> 45:49.750]  You don't.
[45:49.750 --> 45:52.110]  And outdoor I think makes better hash.
[45:52.110 --> 45:53.310]  So now you just went from, hey,
[45:53.310 --> 45:55.150]  this crop is more valuable to,
[45:55.150 --> 45:57.310]  this crop is actually more valuable.
[45:57.310 --> 45:59.710]  So that's a good business model for folks
[45:59.710 --> 46:00.910]  that are out there, you know,
[46:00.910 --> 46:02.870]  trying to put it together and trying to understand,
[46:02.870 --> 46:03.830]  man, how am I gonna make it?
[46:03.830 --> 46:05.270]  How can I, I wanna do flowers.
[46:05.270 --> 46:07.910]  Well, maybe you can't do flowers, you know?
[46:07.910 --> 46:10.910]  But you better have the right hash plants.
[46:11.750 --> 46:14.310]  You know, otherwise you're gonna pay the toll on the end
[46:14.310 --> 46:15.310]  in a different way.
[46:16.710 --> 46:18.470]  So, you know, that's kind of the advice
[46:19.110 --> 46:20.710]  I'd give you if you're trying to do that, you know?
[46:20.710 --> 46:22.790]  And, you know, reach out if you need some help
[46:22.790 --> 46:24.150]  with some stuff.
[46:24.150 --> 46:26.910]  So do you see any correlation between
[46:29.630 --> 46:33.230]  when plants excel and where they were bred at?
[46:33.230 --> 46:36.510]  Like, does your homegrown seed,
[46:36.510 --> 46:37.950]  does that do better in the summer?
[46:37.950 --> 46:39.630]  Cause it's more acclimated to this area.
[46:39.630 --> 46:40.470]  Whereas like,
[46:42.390 --> 46:46.230]  like Cali genetics would just do horrible in the spring.
[46:46.230 --> 46:47.950]  I mean, I'm trying to think of-
[46:48.590 --> 46:51.470]  This is a great topic, I think,
[46:51.470 --> 46:54.670]  because we talk about this
[46:54.670 --> 46:56.270]  with the regenerative seed company.
[46:56.270 --> 46:57.910]  And, you know, basically everybody
[46:57.910 --> 47:00.350]  that's on the regenerative seed company
[47:00.350 --> 47:01.510]  and moving through that site
[47:01.510 --> 47:03.790]  is gotta do some natural breeding.
[47:03.790 --> 47:05.750]  You gotta be doing it in your backyard.
[47:07.070 --> 47:08.950]  I'll have to get a video into you guys
[47:08.950 --> 47:10.630]  of my greenhouse out here
[47:10.630 --> 47:12.870]  and the big, huge, giant boy that's in there.
[47:12.870 --> 47:15.790]  And it was actually like a volunteer boy
[47:15.790 --> 47:17.350]  cause we just dropped seeds in the ground
[47:17.710 --> 47:18.550]  and saw what came up, you know?
[47:18.550 --> 47:20.590]  And this was the strongest one, so we let him go.
[47:20.590 --> 47:23.470]  You can be the next stop on the garden tour.
[47:23.470 --> 47:24.310]  Yeah, let's do it.
[47:24.310 --> 47:25.950]  Let's do it.
[47:25.950 --> 47:27.230]  So, you know,
[47:28.390 --> 47:29.550]  we call that,
[47:31.270 --> 47:32.790]  and I learned a lot of this
[47:32.790 --> 47:34.550]  from Dragonfly Earth Medicine folks.
[47:34.550 --> 47:36.390]  And they're just,
[47:36.390 --> 47:39.230]  they're so, so hip and so on it
[47:39.230 --> 47:40.430]  when it comes to this kind of stuff.
[47:40.430 --> 47:45.430]  But there's an intelligence bred into the earth, okay?
[47:46.070 --> 47:47.230]  Into the microbes.
[47:48.070 --> 47:51.190]  So if you're breeding in the same spot year over year,
[47:51.190 --> 47:52.710]  that's getting passed on,
[47:54.030 --> 47:55.470]  the subtle genetic differences
[47:55.470 --> 47:57.910]  are getting passed on to the progeny.
[47:57.910 --> 47:58.990]  And that's important.
[47:58.990 --> 48:00.350]  Cause if you're breeding indoor
[48:00.350 --> 48:01.830]  or in different environments,
[48:01.830 --> 48:04.550]  that little effect is not happening so much.
[48:04.550 --> 48:06.830]  So you can really acclimatize a strain.
[48:06.830 --> 48:07.670]  That's why I encourage people,
[48:07.670 --> 48:09.190]  you buy my seeds, breed with them.
[48:09.190 --> 48:12.310]  If you wanna do that in your backyard for your stuff, do it.
[48:12.310 --> 48:14.710]  You're gonna get better stock over time
[48:14.710 --> 48:16.150]  because it's evolving.
[48:17.430 --> 48:22.430]  Just like if a human being were to move to a certain locale
[48:22.430 --> 48:25.030]  and breed over the centuries,
[48:25.030 --> 48:26.190]  they're going to evolve.
[48:26.190 --> 48:29.030]  They're gonna become more acclimated to that climate.
[48:29.030 --> 48:32.630]  So you can absolutely improve your,
[48:32.630 --> 48:34.070]  everything about your garden
[48:34.070 --> 48:36.910]  and the health of your garden and your plants
[48:36.910 --> 48:39.270]  by following those protocols.
[48:39.270 --> 48:41.510]  When you move a clone,
[48:41.510 --> 48:45.670]  sometimes it takes a couple cycles in that new environment
[48:45.670 --> 48:47.110]  before that clone will adjust.
[48:47.950 --> 48:48.790]  I have seen it.
[48:48.790 --> 48:49.630]  Hands down, I've seen it.
[48:49.630 --> 48:51.430]  My farmers out at the farm,
[48:51.430 --> 48:54.030]  Bearded Kraken and PV,
[48:54.030 --> 48:55.790]  shout out those guys, hardworking buggers.
[48:55.790 --> 48:56.750]  They'll tell you,
[48:57.830 --> 49:00.710]  you run something in the same spot for the first cycle,
[49:00.710 --> 49:02.350]  it might kind of be okay.
[49:02.350 --> 49:03.550]  Next cycle gets a little better.
[49:03.550 --> 49:05.870]  Third cycle, it's like, boom, I got this.
[49:05.870 --> 49:06.830]  Let's do it.
[49:07.670 --> 49:09.190]  And plants are smart that way, right?
[49:09.190 --> 49:10.390]  I mean, if you've grown them in a pot,
[49:10.390 --> 49:12.310]  they know, they're feeling out
[49:12.310 --> 49:13.470]  and finding the edge of the pot
[49:13.470 --> 49:15.110]  and then determining, okay, doing a math,
[49:15.110 --> 49:16.390]  how much, how big can I get?
[49:16.390 --> 49:17.830]  When do I need to flower?
[49:17.830 --> 49:20.510]  I mean, that's why if you got seeds in pots
[49:20.510 --> 49:22.070]  and they get root bound,
[49:22.070 --> 49:23.870]  the boys will start to show
[49:23.870 --> 49:25.190]  because they know,
[49:25.190 --> 49:27.390]  I only got so much time to develop this thing
[49:27.390 --> 49:28.310]  and hit that, whoop, whoop.
[49:28.310 --> 49:30.150]  And they're doing a math equation
[49:30.150 --> 49:32.590]  in their little plant brain that they don't have.
[49:35.510 --> 49:37.430]  So that intelligence gets passed through the seed.
[49:37.430 --> 49:40.550]  So if you can acclimatize something,
[49:40.550 --> 49:42.310]  you bring a cut in from somewhere else,
[49:42.310 --> 49:43.950]  it might not be great the first whatever,
[49:43.950 --> 49:45.350]  but give it some time.
[49:45.350 --> 49:46.270]  Give it some time in there.
[49:47.150 --> 49:48.550]  Don't judge it on the first run either.
[49:48.550 --> 49:52.350]  You know, I've grown some really great gonge
[49:52.350 --> 49:53.630]  in the first couple of times I grew it.
[49:53.630 --> 49:54.550]  I'm like, this strain sucks,
[49:54.550 --> 49:56.230]  but it wasn't the strain, it was me.
[49:56.230 --> 49:58.190]  You know, and I just didn't do enough with it
[49:58.190 --> 50:00.110]  or I didn't understand it well enough.
[50:01.870 --> 50:03.590]  So to me, even when I'm breeding,
[50:03.590 --> 50:06.390]  I wanna get to know the plant before I breed to it.
[50:06.390 --> 50:09.190]  You know, I breed a lot of different stuff that's not,
[50:09.190 --> 50:10.830]  you know, everybody's kind of doing the same,
[50:10.830 --> 50:13.510]  grab a cookies, grab a cake, grab a...
[50:13.510 --> 50:15.550]  And I'm trying to stay in my own lane
[50:15.830 --> 50:16.670]  and do something different
[50:16.670 --> 50:17.910]  because these are strains that I know,
[50:17.910 --> 50:19.870]  these strains that I love, I think they're great.
[50:19.870 --> 50:22.230]  Took me years to collect them, you know,
[50:22.230 --> 50:24.230]  and I see what they can do and I know them.
[50:24.230 --> 50:26.070]  It's not just, hey, I got this in the box
[50:26.070 --> 50:28.310]  and I'm gonna hit it and sell some seeds.
[50:28.310 --> 50:29.870]  So I don't know.
[50:30.710 --> 50:35.710]  There's something to further in the plant, you know.
[50:35.710 --> 50:37.710]  You can use the plant to further yourself and that's okay,
[50:37.710 --> 50:39.190]  but you know, to further the plant,
[50:39.190 --> 50:40.950]  to further the genetics,
[50:40.950 --> 50:44.070]  if you really love this plant, like you say you do,
[50:44.070 --> 50:46.910]  then that's what you should have in mind
[50:46.910 --> 50:48.390]  when you're working with it.
[50:49.950 --> 50:53.510]  I went to the Living Soil Symposium a couple of years back
[50:53.510 --> 50:56.750]  and Kelly talked, the Dragonfly Earth Medicine,
[50:56.750 --> 51:01.750]  Kelly talked and man, she made everybody cry.
[51:01.830 --> 51:03.670]  But you know, me personally,
[51:03.670 --> 51:08.350]  I was a little bit ashamed at the self-promotion
[51:08.350 --> 51:09.190]  that I had put out
[51:09.190 --> 51:12.310]  and the things that I was doing with my business,
[51:12.510 --> 51:15.270]  because I thought that was how I needed to get ahead,
[51:15.270 --> 51:16.790]  and she kind of gave me permission,
[51:16.790 --> 51:18.190]  like, no, it's okay to slow down.
[51:18.190 --> 51:21.710]  It's okay to take care of things and care about it
[51:21.710 --> 51:23.230]  and put some more intention to it.
[51:23.230 --> 51:24.750]  And you're not gonna be the first one
[51:24.750 --> 51:26.630]  across the finish line,
[51:26.630 --> 51:27.710]  but when you get there,
[51:27.710 --> 51:29.670]  you're gonna know that you did it the right way.
[51:29.670 --> 51:32.830]  And to me, that's more important than being first.
[51:36.340 --> 51:37.180]  Shoots.
[51:38.260 --> 51:41.900]  In the past two or three years,
[51:41.940 --> 51:46.460]  I mean, everybody in the hash game's evolving and learning
[51:46.460 --> 51:51.460]  and what are some research projects you did with intent?
[51:54.620 --> 51:57.060]  Like, what were you trying to figure out?
[51:57.060 --> 52:00.700]  And whether it's on breeding the plants for hash
[52:00.700 --> 52:02.980]  or something in the production process
[52:02.980 --> 52:06.260]  or temperatures or whatever,
[52:07.420 --> 52:08.580]  just something you were like,
[52:08.580 --> 52:10.900]  I wanna figure out if it's A or B
[52:10.900 --> 52:13.380]  and then what do we learn?
[52:13.380 --> 52:15.660]  I'm not, I mean, I'm scientific,
[52:15.660 --> 52:17.700]  but I'm not overly scientific.
[52:17.700 --> 52:22.180]  And I'm always trying to learn and I'm a hands-on person.
[52:22.180 --> 52:24.580]  So I've put myself,
[52:24.580 --> 52:26.900]  I've tried to watch with people that I don't know.
[52:26.900 --> 52:27.980]  When I was a gardener,
[52:27.980 --> 52:30.180]  like the best way to learn about other people's gardens
[52:30.180 --> 52:33.580]  or how to do my garden better was to see somebody's garden.
[52:33.580 --> 52:35.940]  So I've tried to connect with different people
[52:35.940 --> 52:38.300]  and watch how they do their process
[52:38.300 --> 52:41.500]  and then have conversations with them.
[52:41.500 --> 52:43.100]  And the list is too long to even name,
[52:43.100 --> 52:45.140]  but I've done this with a lot of people.
[52:47.500 --> 52:49.300]  Sometimes people say there's like,
[52:49.300 --> 52:50.740]  people keep secrets and whatnot.
[52:50.740 --> 52:53.420]  I find that to be the opposite in the hash community
[52:53.420 --> 52:54.660]  that I'm involved in.
[52:54.660 --> 52:56.660]  And I think people really share their stuff.
[52:56.660 --> 52:58.220]  As far as studying goes.
[53:00.100 --> 53:02.100]  Well, what you were just talking about,
[53:02.100 --> 53:04.700]  like what are some processes that you picked up
[53:04.700 --> 53:06.300]  from people along the way,
[53:06.660 --> 53:09.140]  where you were like, oh, that's clever.
[53:09.140 --> 53:11.020]  Oh man, there's too many to mention.
[53:11.020 --> 53:12.180]  Let's mention a few.
[53:12.180 --> 53:14.540]  Yeah, Nick and T showed me like,
[53:14.540 --> 53:17.220]  hey, in between when you're draining your washer,
[53:17.220 --> 53:19.100]  you could pull the bag out and throw it in the freezer
[53:19.100 --> 53:20.300]  just to keep it colder, right?
[53:20.300 --> 53:22.020]  Because there's a slight temperature variation.
[53:22.020 --> 53:25.260]  And when those temperatures variate a little bit in there,
[53:25.260 --> 53:27.180]  you know, it can kind of screw your stuff up.
[53:27.180 --> 53:32.180]  I mean, trimming right into a freezer to keep stuff cold.
[53:33.180 --> 53:34.940]  That was kind of cool.
[53:35.180 --> 53:38.020]  Just different tech stuff comes up all the time.
[53:38.020 --> 53:41.060]  The flower rosin tech or the bulletproof tech,
[53:41.060 --> 53:43.980]  burrito tech was, you stuff your thing
[53:43.980 --> 53:45.340]  and then you can wrap the deal this way
[53:45.340 --> 53:47.740]  to make directional flow when you're pressing it.
[53:47.740 --> 53:51.220]  And that was from the guy that runs straight concentrates.
[53:52.140 --> 53:53.780]  There's been so many over the years.
[53:53.780 --> 53:54.620]  It's really cool.
[53:54.620 --> 53:57.140]  And somebody is always coming out with something new.
[53:58.340 --> 54:00.620]  The carts, again, I'm not terribly into the carts,
[54:00.620 --> 54:01.900]  but to me, that's really awesome.
[54:01.900 --> 54:03.900]  So they're taking the hash,
[54:03.900 --> 54:06.100]  put it in a jar, roll it in a little heat pad
[54:06.100 --> 54:10.620]  and keep it at 150, 160 degrees for X amount of hours.
[54:10.620 --> 54:14.700]  And basically it turns it all into syrup
[54:14.700 --> 54:16.060]  and it's not gonna come back from that.
[54:16.060 --> 54:17.940]  So now it's viscous enough
[54:17.940 --> 54:19.420]  that you can put it into the pens.
[54:19.420 --> 54:20.980]  To me, that was really awesome.
[54:22.660 --> 54:24.380]  But again, I feel like I've learned
[54:24.380 --> 54:27.340]  so many of the different hash techniques.
[54:27.340 --> 54:29.740]  And I can understand now that, you know,
[54:29.740 --> 54:31.980]  your environment's very important.
[54:32.020 --> 54:34.660]  The CoolBot, if you guys don't know about a CoolBot,
[54:34.660 --> 54:35.540]  Google it.
[54:35.540 --> 54:37.220]  It's a little cheap device
[54:37.220 --> 54:40.980]  that you can hook up to your air conditioner.
[54:40.980 --> 54:42.100]  And your air conditioner will go
[54:42.100 --> 54:45.340]  from making your room 60 degrees to making your room 35.
[54:45.340 --> 54:47.540]  Mine stays at 43 degrees.
[54:47.540 --> 54:48.940]  That's the CoolBot.
[54:48.940 --> 54:49.980]  That was a great tech.
[54:49.980 --> 54:53.780]  My buddy, the goat shared that with me a long time ago.
[54:53.780 --> 54:55.820]  Shout out the goat up here in Seattle.
[54:57.620 --> 54:59.940]  You know, how cool is it, right?
[54:59.940 --> 55:01.100]  The coolest thing.
[55:01.100 --> 55:02.500]  This guy, yeah.
[55:02.500 --> 55:03.340]  It works great.
[55:03.340 --> 55:05.860]  Holy shit, I got like four of those.
[55:05.860 --> 55:06.700]  Yeah, right?
[55:06.700 --> 55:08.620]  I know a buddy that made his own
[55:08.620 --> 55:10.940]  with like parts under 50 bucks
[55:10.940 --> 55:13.220]  and he made his own CoolBot.
[55:13.220 --> 55:15.300]  And I wish I could do that.
[55:15.300 --> 55:17.180]  But yeah, these are a life changer.
[55:17.180 --> 55:18.260]  Like this is a game changer.
[55:18.260 --> 55:19.980]  You need to get your environment dialed in
[55:19.980 --> 55:22.260]  and that thing is perfect.
[55:22.260 --> 55:23.660]  Yeah, massive.
[55:23.660 --> 55:25.020]  You know, it helps with your yields.
[55:25.020 --> 55:25.980]  Now you've got an environment
[55:25.980 --> 55:28.700]  where you can actually dry hash on the racks
[55:28.700 --> 55:30.860]  and it's not gonna melt in the process.
[55:31.820 --> 55:35.140]  I used to go up to Seattle like at midnight
[55:35.140 --> 55:37.500]  and meet my friend, the generous chef.
[55:37.500 --> 55:38.700]  Shout out generous chef.
[55:38.700 --> 55:40.740]  And he would let me go into his,
[55:40.740 --> 55:44.260]  he had a freezer, a walk-in freezer that was empty.
[55:44.260 --> 55:46.260]  And I'd bring all my hash and my weed and shit
[55:46.260 --> 55:47.980]  and go in there and I'd wash.
[55:47.980 --> 55:51.180]  And then I put it on my pans and I stack it in my truck
[55:51.180 --> 55:53.580]  and I drive home at six in the morning.
[55:53.580 --> 55:55.260]  But I didn't have a cold room to keep it.
[55:55.260 --> 55:56.220]  You know, it was grated.
[55:56.220 --> 55:57.580]  It was, and it would come out great.
[55:57.580 --> 56:00.220]  It was beautiful, little like water droplet looking
[56:00.220 --> 56:03.380]  pieces of hash, but it would oxidize and it would be brown.
[56:03.380 --> 56:04.900]  And now I can do that and make it white
[56:04.900 --> 56:06.660]  because you can keep it cold.
[56:07.540 --> 56:11.140]  So, I mean, that was a great little tech drop
[56:11.140 --> 56:13.780]  that people shared with each other in the hash world.
[56:15.060 --> 56:19.580]  But for me, you know, and I know shout out Cuban grower.
[56:21.180 --> 56:23.140]  He was smashing it with hash for the longest.
[56:23.140 --> 56:25.860]  And then he really wanted to delve back into growing
[56:25.860 --> 56:28.180]  and figuring out how to grow better.
[56:28.180 --> 56:30.980]  And to me, that was a move I made a long time ago
[56:30.980 --> 56:34.340]  was all things being equal in your hash making process.
[56:34.340 --> 56:37.820]  Right, we established the best standards.
[56:39.940 --> 56:42.180]  Now it's how's your shit grown?
[56:42.180 --> 56:43.940]  You know, who's got the best weed?
[56:43.940 --> 56:47.180]  And that really led me down the natural farming path
[56:47.180 --> 56:48.220]  and regenerative farming
[56:48.220 --> 56:50.340]  and learning Korean natural farming.
[56:50.340 --> 56:54.220]  And, you know, I'm pretty steeped in it now.
[56:54.220 --> 56:55.700]  You know, I teach it to my kids
[56:56.540 --> 56:57.380]  and I go to speak on it.
[56:57.380 --> 56:58.900]  And, you know, to me, that stuff,
[56:58.900 --> 57:02.100]  my guys out in Hawaii, you know,
[57:02.100 --> 57:03.540]  Korean natural farming masters,
[57:03.540 --> 57:05.460]  and then they got the Hawaiian sun on top of it.
[57:05.460 --> 57:08.100]  And I'm telling you, go out there and smoke that hash.
[57:08.100 --> 57:10.420]  It will take you to another level.
[57:10.420 --> 57:12.180]  You know, they call it metaphysical grade.
[57:12.180 --> 57:15.780]  And it really is, you know, I'm pretty proud of my stuff.
[57:15.780 --> 57:19.300]  And for years and years I'd show up and they'd mob me.
[57:19.300 --> 57:22.660]  And now I'm mobbing them because it's,
[57:23.620 --> 57:27.300]  again, that curve is just, you know, it's skyrocketing.
[57:27.300 --> 57:29.380]  And, you know, they've got the environments
[57:29.380 --> 57:31.060]  to do that kind of stuff.
[57:31.060 --> 57:33.700]  And I don't know, I think it's pretty hot.
[57:33.700 --> 57:38.220]  Can you talk about kind of smoking hash
[57:38.220 --> 57:40.180]  from plants that were growing?
[57:40.180 --> 57:41.620]  What'd you say, Hawaii has 11
[57:41.620 --> 57:44.100]  of the 13 microclimates or something?
[57:44.100 --> 57:45.060]  Yes, yes.
[57:45.060 --> 57:49.460]  So like you've smoked hash that's been from each of them
[57:49.460 --> 57:51.380]  or at least a whole bunch.
[57:52.740 --> 57:56.020]  Yeah, we actually had the Hawaiian invitational
[57:56.020 --> 57:58.820]  hash contest out there a couple of years ago.
[57:59.620 --> 58:04.580]  And I showed up and my buddies, Conscious Rhythms,
[58:04.580 --> 58:06.340]  Roots Kwan and Fire Red Beard.
[58:06.340 --> 58:08.900]  And they were like, we're gonna have a hash competition.
[58:08.900 --> 58:09.780]  How long are you here for?
[58:09.780 --> 58:10.980]  And I'm like, I'm here for three weeks.
[58:10.980 --> 58:12.660]  And they're like, all right, two weeks, we're gonna have it.
[58:13.380 --> 58:16.260]  And we showed up at this mountain place two weeks later.
[58:16.260 --> 58:19.940]  And there was 30 entries to this thing, like that quick.
[58:20.580 --> 58:22.100]  And it was some of the best hash.
[58:22.980 --> 58:27.780]  And the guy that actually won it was Rusty
[58:28.500 --> 58:29.700]  from Freshwater Farms.
[58:30.500 --> 58:34.180]  And he had this hash, it was so crazy.
[58:34.180 --> 58:38.020]  It was just like, it was like crystals.
[58:38.020 --> 58:40.420]  And I'd never seen anything like it.
[58:40.980 --> 58:43.220]  And I pressed him a little bit like, what was your process?
[58:43.220 --> 58:44.500]  And he's like, I gave it treatments.
[58:44.500 --> 58:48.260]  And it took a while, but he eventually kind of explained
[58:48.260 --> 58:50.420]  how he was doing like warm and then cold.
[58:52.820 --> 58:56.180]  But I think the real sweet spot in Hawaii
[58:56.180 --> 58:59.700]  is like 1500 feet above sea level.
[58:59.700 --> 59:01.460]  And at that elevation, it's just kind of
[59:01.460 --> 59:03.700]  the perfect microclimate.
[59:04.260 --> 59:07.140]  And they really produce high grade stuff.
[59:07.140 --> 59:09.700]  And to me, that's kind of the best stuff.
[59:09.700 --> 59:11.860]  The stuff from up on the mountain is also very good.
[59:14.100 --> 59:16.660]  I've had some of those flowers that were incredible smoke.
[59:17.540 --> 59:19.540]  But I think that's at that level,
[59:19.540 --> 59:23.060]  just it gets a higher penetration of the sun or something.
[59:23.060 --> 59:25.780]  But man, it makes incredible hash.
[59:25.780 --> 59:29.300]  And just really, you know, terpy, super, super, super terpy.
[59:29.300 --> 59:31.460]  That could also be the Korean natural farming methods
[59:31.460 --> 59:32.260]  that he's employing.
[59:32.260 --> 59:34.580]  So, but I'll give him credit.
[59:35.460 --> 59:36.660]  So go ahead.
[59:37.220 --> 59:39.140]  I was just gonna ask if you noticed the difference
[59:39.140 --> 59:41.540]  between like the South side and the North side
[59:41.540 --> 59:43.460]  of the island that at 1500,
[59:43.460 --> 59:45.540]  like, is there a difference out there?
[59:45.940 --> 59:47.940]  Cause it's so far South.
[59:47.940 --> 59:49.380]  I don't know that it makes a difference
[59:49.380 --> 59:50.580]  as much as it would up here.
[59:51.540 --> 59:55.460]  Yeah, no, it's, that as far as North, South thing,
[59:55.460 --> 59:56.500]  it really doesn't matter.
[59:57.940 --> 01:00:01.460]  Really what you're talking about is elevation, number one.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.940]  And number two is, you know, where you're at on the island.
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.940]  So the leeward side gets more rain.
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:09.860]  The windward side gets less, or I think it's the reverse.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.380]  Sorry, the windward side gets more rain.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:14.900]  The leeward side gets less, at least on big island.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:19.060]  Because we get the wind coming from Seattle
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.820]  and it hits Hilo side first.
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.260]  So those guys get rained on more.
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.660]  It's harder to grow herbs out there.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:28.020]  And, you know, they battle pathogens and caterpillars
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:28.980]  and all kinds of stuff.
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.180]  So I think the guys that are growing on the leeward side,
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:37.140]  Kona side are growing, you know, superior herbs.
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:41.460]  The top soil is really good on the North part of the island.
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.420]  But the guys that are growing in the South part
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:47.540]  of the island, you know, South Kona and stuff,
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:50.740]  you know, they're just masters of their environment.
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.980]  And they've really figured it out over the years
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.260]  and built up soils.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:57.940]  And, you know, the herbs are just incredible.
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:00:59.540]  It's fun to smoke.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:01.240]  Nice.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:04.900]  I would agree with that.
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:13.060]  Did you notice a large change in the Caribbean expressions
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.140]  when you started the shift towards natural farming?
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.940]  You know, absolutely.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:23.140]  I had grown hydroponics a long time ago.
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:24.500]  I learned hydroponics.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:28.740]  I learned to grow herb when basically, like, you'd set up
[01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.820]  in up here in Seattle, nobody grew outdoor.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:34.420]  It's just not even a thing until the last five years.
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:35.460]  Everybody grew indoor.
[01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:36.180]  That's all you did.
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:40.100]  And you would set up a hydroponic system
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.580]  because you only had to go to the house once a week
[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.020]  to switch out the reservoir.
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:46.100]  You know, I mean, this was like illegal days, you know,
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.700]  you'd get caught, like, taking all your shit.
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.620]  So that's what I learned.
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:54.900]  And then about 11 years ago, I met my wife.
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:02:00.900]  And, you know, I was like, let's get this garden cracking.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:04.660]  And we wanted to do it in a different way.
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:07.300]  I had a hydro set up and I'm like, let's switch it
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.940]  all to organics because we've got kids coming
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.540]  and I just didn't want them to be around it.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:15.300]  And before that, when I, you know, some people
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.060]  that were really hip, you know, they could say,
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:20.020]  oh man, you grew that with botanic care,
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.940]  you grew that with, you know, whatever it was.
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.940]  And, you know, you could smell it, you know.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:30.740]  And nowadays, you just don't, you know,
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.180]  it's just like a non thing.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.780]  So, you know, just like if you were to eat McDonald's
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.100]  every day, your skin is going to start to smell funny.
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.100]  You're going to have a weird stink.
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:42.100]  Sorry, if you eat McDonald's every day, quit that shit.
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.260]  You're going to have a weird stink to you.
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.940]  So if you're feeding your plant good stuff,
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:49.860]  it's going to have a different thing than if it's
[01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:51.860]  some kind of chemical or salt stuff.
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:54.020]  I hate to bang on the chemical or salt guys,
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.140]  but you know, that's just the reality of the thing.
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.820]  You know, we used to hear old timers, right?
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:02.180]  Oh, put the old mango fruit around your plant
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:03.300]  and it will taste like mangoes.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.660]  And we go, fuck, no way.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:05.860]  It's true.
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.900]  It's true because the microbes are breaking that down
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.500]  and then they're trading it to the plant.
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.860]  That's how the shit works.
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:15.300]  How do you think the pear tree grows in the forest?
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:16.980]  It feeds itself.
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:17.940]  What's it feeding itself?
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.620]  Pears, right?
[01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.940]  It grows them, it drops them, it's a cycle.
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.020]  And that's more natural.
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:26.260]  Feed the cannabis plant cannabis.
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:26.980]  It loves it.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:30.820]  You know, when I started using FFJ as a finisher, right?
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:34.500]  So when I did hydroponics, there was a sweetener.
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.700]  I can't remember what it was called.
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.340]  I used cutting edge solutions for a long time
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.900]  and they have a really sweetener and it smelled like candy.
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.820]  You put it in the thing and fuck, it smelled like candy.
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.500]  It didn't taste like candy, but weed at the end.
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:48.420]  But now I use fermented fruit juice.
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:52.420]  And it doesn't smell like the fruit juice,
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.340]  but it kicks up whatever the turps are,
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.180]  it just turns them up a dial.
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:57.460]  You know, it turns them up a notch
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:01.540]  and brings out a little more of that expression in it.
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:05.060]  So if you're using sweeteners out there,
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:08.180]  find some fruit and ferment it
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:11.540]  and use that as your sweetener at the end of your finisher.
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:15.140]  Because it's just a more, it's more pronounced, you know?
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:15.780]  It tastes good.
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:20.820]  And you can match different FFJs up with different cultivars as well.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.700]  The apples work really good with my coffee.
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.860]  I was just going to ask, are you using local fruits
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.500]  or are you using like tropical fruits for your FFJs?
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:33.540]  So no disrespect to people that are buying fruit at the store.
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.180]  That's cool.
[01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:36.820]  But that's not Korean natural farming.
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:39.140]  That's not Master Cho's methodology.
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:39.780]  You got to go-
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:43.460]  I also wouldn't trust him at all, even if it says organic.
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:44.900]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:45.700]  It's fumigated.
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:46.660]  Okay?
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:47.540]  They're all fumigated.
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.180]  So if you want the microorganisms,
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.980]  this is a whole wormhole.
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.820]  We should go down another day, Peter,
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:57.940]  with some of my natural farming friends
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:59.860]  because this stuff will really blow your mind.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.940]  But if I go out and pick a carrot from my garden, right?
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:06.820]  I don't even wash it.
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.500]  I wipe it off and I eat it.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.100]  And you know what it's covered with?
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.540]  Microorganisms.
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:14.020]  And those microorganisms are the same microorganisms
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.140]  that are in my na'au.
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.020]  They're in my stomach.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:20.900]  And that breaks down the food and makes it available to my body.
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.420]  My body's not breaking down a carrot
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.940]  and putting a carrot in my bloodstream.
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.860]  It's the microorganisms are breaking it down
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.700]  and trading with my body.
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:28.740]  And that's how that works.
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:28.980]  Okay?
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:33.220]  So you got to have that going on there
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.340]  or you're missing out.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:34.980]  You know what I mean?
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:41.220]  So people in the chat are confirming
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:45.220]  that they want a whole episode on the natural farming stuff.
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.260]  Another man that drinks out of a quart jar.
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:48.980]  I love it, man.
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:50.900]  Wait, what?
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.380]  He just took a sip off.
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.540]  I think it was water, but it's out of a quart jar.
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:56.980]  That's the only thing I drink out of.
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.740]  It's a wide-mouthed quart jar, yeah.
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.620]  You know, all over my house,
[01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:02.900]  we just canned a bunch of peaches.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:06.340]  I don't know.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:07.380]  I lost my train of thought, Peter.
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:10.740]  But, you know, I'm just saying,
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:12.500]  those microorganisms are so important
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.100]  and it's the same ones in our stomach.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.260]  That's why you don't want to use glycophosphate
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.460]  or any of that shit
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.780]  or eat stuff that doesn't have it on there
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.500]  because it's going to kill the microorganisms in your stomach
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:23.300]  and you need those.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:26.260]  And the plant needs them in their soil.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.100]  It's all connected.
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:29.700]  It's all the same thing, you know?
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:32.260]  And you can learn from that and apply it to your garden.
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.700]  You can apply it to your own body.
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:35.140]  You'll be enriched for it.
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.820]  So have you noticed, like,
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.620]  for yourself,
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:46.660]  a better flavor and quality of the hash
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:48.260]  since you've been adopting
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.660]  and using some of the natural farming techniques?
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:51.220]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.660]  Like, is there anything you notice, like,
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.820]  with your hash now versus 10 years ago
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:57.380]  where it's not just you getting better at making hash,
[01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:58.900]  but you can attribute it to like...
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:06:59.460]  No, man.
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:02.740]  The thing is, I'm not a big fan of the natural farming techniques.
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:03.460]  No, man.
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.380]  The farming methods are better.
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:09.140]  Again, the plant material holds up better in the water
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:10.260]  when it's healthy
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:12.740]  and it's got a solid cell structure.
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.740]  It doesn't break down as fast.
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:18.420]  So when you're working the paddle,
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:19.380]  you can tell, like,
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:21.380]  oh, this was just a weak ass...
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:25.060]  Yeah, you wash a plant that didn't do well
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.020]  or that was even sick.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.780]  I mean, even if it's in a good garden,
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.340]  if it's not structurally strong,
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.820]  it's gonna start to bleed out in that water faster.
[01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.300]  You know, any hash...
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:37.700]  It's super important, yeah?
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:43.140]  Fred, have you washed some mediocre flower in the day?
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:45.880]  Oh, yes.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.100]  I could be a dry brittle.
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:53.860]  I washed it all.
[01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:01.910]  Someone asked a while ago,
[01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:03.670]  natural alternatives.
[01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:06.630]  So if you don't have a freeze dryer,
[01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:09.750]  what's the best way to dry hash?
[01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:13.270]  Would you just put it out in the sun or...?
[01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:14.070]  No!
[01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:16.630]  Freeze dryers are terribly expensive, right?
[01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:17.670]  Super expensive.
[01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:20.070]  So here's what you're gonna wanna do.
[01:08:21.190 --> 01:08:22.790]  You wanna break that hash down
[01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:26.310]  into the smallest particle that you can, right?
[01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:28.150]  To give it the most surface area so it can dry.
[01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:31.670]  So if you scoop your hash out of your bag,
[01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:35.190]  you can run it through a sieve.
[01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:38.230]  You can freeze it and microplane it.
[01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:39.350]  I would do one of the two.
[01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:40.950]  I prefer the sieve.
[01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.950]  So get yourself some cookie sheets.
[01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:47.110]  You could use a cardboard box if you want.
[01:08:48.150 --> 01:08:49.750]  But then lay down some parchment paper.
[01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:51.510]  Don't put it right on the cookie sheet
[01:08:52.150 --> 01:08:53.350]  or right on the cardboard.
[01:08:54.150 --> 01:08:55.590]  Lay down your parchment paper
[01:08:56.550 --> 01:09:00.390]  and then sieve it over the parchment paper
[01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:02.630]  to make it as small as possible.
[01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:03.750]  Spread it out.
[01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:05.830]  And then you can dry it in whatever environment you want.
[01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:09.110]  The drier the air and the colder the air, the better.
[01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:10.870]  So if you've got an environment
[01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:14.070]  where you can be at 40 degrees relative humidity
[01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:19.030]  and 40 degrees Fahrenheit, that's kind of perfect.
[01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:21.670]  It's gonna take a while to dry, but it's gonna dry.
[01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:24.470]  So the closer you can get to that, the better.
[01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:26.390]  The warmer the temperatures,
[01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:27.990]  you're gonna have a little bit of color change,
[01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.950]  some oxidization.
[01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.270]  But it will dry.
[01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:35.030]  Again, 10 years ago, that's what I was doing.
[01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:38.150]  I would put it on a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
[01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:40.710]  I put it on racks and it would just dry
[01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:43.750]  in a regular drying room with the dehumidifier on
[01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:45.830]  and the temperature would be 70 degrees
[01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:48.150]  and it would take a week, 10 days to dry.
[01:09:49.190 --> 01:09:50.870]  And it would come back more brown,
[01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:53.750]  but surely full melt.
[01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:55.350]  And that's totally acceptable.
[01:09:55.670 --> 01:09:59.270]  So Fred, this question was teeing you up
[01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:01.670]  because you don't have, or actually people want to know,
[01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:03.430]  have you gotten the freeze dryer yet?
[01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:10.470]  I do have one behind me, but I am not using it right now.
[01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:13.670]  I have not yet done a run in the freeze dryer yet.
[01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:14.470]  How come?
[01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:18.870]  I haven't set the settings yet.
[01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.910]  You need some help?
[01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:20.630]  It was locked.
[01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:24.150]  Yeah, I could use help on that.
[01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:25.110]  I could use help.
[01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:26.310]  I'm always open to help.
[01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:28.390]  I just recently unlocked it.
[01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:30.550]  It was locked to the password and we got it unlocked.
[01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:35.270]  I just haven't ran a run through yet.
[01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.390]  Awesome.
[01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:40.390]  There's some cool little tricks
[01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:42.230]  where you can save your settings on there,
[01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:45.110]  but you're going to want to change the settings
[01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:46.710]  for your shelf temperature.
[01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:51.430]  So you're going to want to bring your shelf temperature down.
[01:10:52.150 --> 01:10:52.870]  Have you done that?
[01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:55.050]  Right.
[01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:58.070]  No, I've used one in the past before
[01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:04.790]  and it was a different screen for sure than this one was.
[01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:11.270]  So just kind of getting used to the new looking screen, I guess.
[01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:13.750]  But yeah, there's the shelf temperatures
[01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:16.870]  and then there's the hours, the freezing hours,
[01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:18.230]  and the drying hours.
[01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:23.910]  I just haven't had the need for it yet.
[01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:27.190]  I've been using this beer fridge here.
[01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:32.950]  And the beer fridge is what I wanted to trigger you to talk about
[01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:34.470]  because without a freeze dryer,
[01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:36.470]  you have your own unique drying method, right?
[01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:40.310]  Yeah, like he was saying,
[01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:43.990]  I used to do the same method with the pizza boxes
[01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:46.230]  and I would get it on parchment very thinly
[01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:49.510]  and bounce it back and forth from the freezer in the fridge
[01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:52.790]  and that got old with the wife.
[01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:56.470]  So I had to move on and I picked up this beer fridge
[01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:58.150]  and just try to do the same thing
[01:11:58.150 --> 01:12:00.390]  and it actually works really, really well.
[01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:06.470]  It keeps the hash looking white as well, you know,
[01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:09.030]  or as light as color as possible.
[01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:11.910]  Way better than the fridge inside.
[01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:15.990]  So yeah, the beer fridge hasn't done me any wrong
[01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:17.670]  and it's been working
[01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:21.430]  and I haven't had like the need to like speed up things too much.
[01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:24.790]  You know, I'm not doing this on a giant scale.
[01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:29.590]  But I do want to experiment more with the freeze dryer.
[01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:31.270]  But that's coming up.
[01:12:34.670 --> 01:12:36.350]  Are you excited for the freeze dryer?
[01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:40.110]  Kind of not really.
[01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:42.110]  I think it might bring in more problems.
[01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:45.230]  It might open up some more problems with like issues.
[01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:48.750]  I might ruin a batch or two in trying to dial an in email.
[01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:54.030]  But so that's why I'm on a big huge rush.
[01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:55.710]  But I had an opportunity to grab one.
[01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:57.790]  So I had to pick one up.
[01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.590]  I had to pick it up because I, you know,
[01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:04.510]  I figured in the future it'll be needed for sure.
[01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:12.510]  Can you guys talk about kind of when you like to chop?
[01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:16.750]  Like are you looking for like a super amber, like knock you out?
[01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:24.350]  Kind of hash or like, obviously if you chop early,
[01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:27.390]  it's like almost like young and tart, right?
[01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:32.590]  It would be interesting to see someone do a strain
[01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:35.070]  and actually chop it like in the early stage,
[01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:38.910]  in the late stage and like a mid stage
[01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:42.350]  and see how that would be, you know, to test that.
[01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:45.550]  We all have our favorite like hash strains.
[01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:47.470]  I'm sure none of us would have a problem
[01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:50.270]  like growing one out longer, you know, and trying that out.
[01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:54.510]  But like what level of ripeness
[01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:59.470]  or like the mix of tricomb colors and the dominant
[01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:03.870]  like white, amber, clear are you looking for when you chop?
[01:14:06.670 --> 01:14:11.150]  For me, I prefer, you know, that they're all white.
[01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:14.590]  I don't necessarily need the amber stuff.
[01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:16.910]  I like it when it's ripe, not so overripe.
[01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:21.470]  But having said that, I prefer that my team lets them go
[01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:23.150]  as long as they possibly can too.
[01:14:23.150 --> 01:14:25.470]  You know, sometimes there's different factors that come in.
[01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:26.590]  You know, if you've got, you know,
[01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:30.190]  the next group of plants is ready and you gotta move them in
[01:14:30.190 --> 01:14:32.990]  or maybe you have a problem coming in
[01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:35.470]  or you're dealing with bugs or something,
[01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:37.630]  that might force your hand.
[01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:39.870]  But, you know, generally let them go.
[01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:41.470]  When you think they're done, let them go another week
[01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:45.710]  and see what happens, you know.
[01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:49.310]  But I don't necessarily look for the amber tricomb.
[01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:52.590]  I like them to be more of the, you know, no clear heads,
[01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:55.070]  but surely, you know, where they're mostly white.
[01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:56.430]  You know, I want it at the peak.
[01:14:57.710 --> 01:14:59.790]  And I think the turpentine is that way too.
[01:14:59.790 --> 01:15:00.670]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:06.590]  And Tara Lee asked, and I don't know if this was for Fred
[01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:10.350]  or, but what, so Fred, what temperature do you keep
[01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:11.470]  that beer fridge at?
[01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:13.630]  And then Kai, what kind of temperatures are you?
[01:15:14.190 --> 01:15:19.070]  It's set to 23 degrees and I threw a, you know,
[01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:24.030]  I threw a little thermometer humidity reader in there
[01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:28.990]  and it read to like 19 degrees and 10% inside.
[01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:32.430]  So it's pretty cold and pretty dry.
[01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:36.190]  That's super cold and super dry.
[01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:36.990]  That's awesome.
[01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:39.630]  Yeah. If that thing's accurate, you know.
[01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:42.910]  Even if it's not accurate, that's close enough.
[01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:46.030]  Close enough to like incredible, you know,
[01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:48.670]  I can't control my climate to that degree
[01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:51.630]  because my climate is, you know, it's a big,
[01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:52.830]  two big rooms actually.
[01:15:54.030 --> 01:15:57.150]  So in my climate where I'm drying on the racks,
[01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:59.550]  I also have a freeze dryer, but I'm also using racks
[01:15:59.550 --> 01:16:01.710]  for the sieves stuff, the six star.
[01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:05.390]  And I've got basically two rooms that are joined
[01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:07.950]  and each room is, I don't know, maybe 10 by 10,
[01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:11.390]  maybe a little bigger, fully insulated.
[01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:16.190]  And each room has got a 2,500 BTU air conditioner
[01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:17.630]  with a cool bot on it.
[01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:20.110]  So I'm holding temps around 43.
[01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:24.270]  And then I also have two dehumidifiers, one in each room.
[01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:29.150]  And, you know, if I get down to 60 or 55, I'm pretty stoked.
[01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:35.470]  You know, 10% dry is like, oh man, that's killer.
[01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:36.110]  That's killer.
[01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:37.390]  I mean, it's a small environment,
[01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:38.830]  so easier to control though, yeah?
[01:16:39.630 --> 01:16:40.430]  Exactly. Yeah.
[01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:45.150]  Super small, you know, I would love to make,
[01:16:45.150 --> 01:16:47.230]  to make it bigger, I'm pretty sure, you know,
[01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:50.430]  and this exact one's like a thousand bucks brand new,
[01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:52.590]  you know, from the manufacturer.
[01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:56.910]  Yeah. Who, someone wanted to know who makes that
[01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:58.990]  or is it just like a pretty common thing?
[01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:03.230]  Well, we, me and Fogel, Fogel's the company,
[01:17:03.230 --> 01:17:04.830]  we just signed a deal.
[01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:08.030]  So, you know, we're going to be building some
[01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:09.710]  in the future, just kidding.
[01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:12.350]  But yeah, that'd be cool.
[01:17:14.670 --> 01:17:16.270]  We should totally approach them and be like,
[01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:18.430]  can we just tweak this for the weed market?
[01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:22.190]  Like I love when companies realize that like,
[01:17:22.190 --> 01:17:25.230]  they'll sell millions and millions of dollars of,
[01:17:25.230 --> 01:17:28.190]  like, that's what I loved about the early kind of like
[01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:29.950]  cannabis stuff, like all the, you know,
[01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:32.190]  extraction companies that were like, yeah,
[01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:34.910]  like normally, obviously there's like hop extractors
[01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:37.390]  who buy our stuff and like, you know,
[01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:39.550]  essential oil extractors.
[01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:41.950]  And then like, suddenly we were getting all these sales
[01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:44.350]  into Colorado and California and we're like,
[01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:47.230]  who the hell, like, is there hops growing
[01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:48.350]  all over the world now?
[01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:50.030]  And it's like, no, it's the weed market.
[01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:52.750]  And then suddenly they're showing up.
[01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:56.590]  I've seen like hops.
[01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:58.510]  And brewing, brewing companies.
[01:17:58.510 --> 01:17:59.950]  I've seen like little brew tanks.
[01:17:59.950 --> 01:18:01.230]  Yeah, stout tanks.
[01:18:01.230 --> 01:18:02.510]  Yeah, stout.
[01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:04.670]  Yeah. It's pretty cool.
[01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:07.150]  I can't wait for the ball to really, really drop.
[01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:11.390]  But yeah, it's a Fogel's a brand.
[01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:13.550]  It's like a beer froster, you know?
[01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:15.550]  So it's a good alternative to a-
[01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:16.990]  What is a beer froster?
[01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:18.990]  A freeze dryer.
[01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:21.790]  I gotta get one of those for my personal thing.
[01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:24.670]  I'm telling you, this is like a come up,
[01:18:24.670 --> 01:18:25.950]  like it's meant to be.
[01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:28.270]  Cause I'm from the HVAC industry
[01:18:29.150 --> 01:18:34.030]  and I worked my way from the field into the warehouse
[01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:35.550]  to the hell out of there, you know?
[01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:39.150]  But before I did, I met a guy that works in refrigeration
[01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:42.110]  and he had a whole garage full of these.
[01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:44.430]  And I grabbed one for like 150 bucks.
[01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:47.550]  And that was like the best investment I've made.
[01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:51.150]  So, you know, for a while.
[01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:52.030]  Does he have more?
[01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:57.790]  I think there are a lot of SoCal hash makers.
[01:18:59.310 --> 01:18:59.810]  Right.
[01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:01.950]  Yeah, he had a few there.
[01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:03.310]  They're all kind of like busted.
[01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:04.910]  This is the best looking one.
[01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:06.510]  And it runs perfect.
[01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:09.390]  But yeah, out of Oxnard, it's pretty cool.
[01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:12.510]  So yeah, if you're in the Southern California area,
[01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:15.230]  you want a beer fridge, hit me up.
[01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:22.270]  So just quickly, Nate said the best hash is when anthocyanins,
[01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:24.910]  the purple hue or orange beta carot-
[01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:27.150]  Is it carotenoids?
[01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:28.030]  Carotenoids?
[01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:30.590]  The color of the-
[01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:31.950]  Help on the pronunciations.
[01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:33.390]  What do you like?
[01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:37.070]  Is there anything that you know will just kind of make a good hash?
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.500]  Either of the hash make-
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.060]  Yeah, why?
[01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.540]  I mean, do you agree with Nate?
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:54.300]  Like, do you like washing kind of the purple cultivars?
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:20:03.500]  I think a lot of the Indica plants are the ones that are expressing that purple gene.
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:06.380]  And so that's probably why we like washing them,
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:09.100]  because it's kind of indicative that you're going to get some big heads.
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:14.060]  I like the hamma hamma, turns the water purple.
[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:18.540]  That pinkleberry turns it this crazy bright burgundy color.
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:21.340]  So yeah, I-
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:28.460]  So do you notice that kind of like Afghani lineage cultivars
[01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:32.220]  make better hash versus like tropical?
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:34.940]  Oh, without a doubt.
[01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:35.660]  Without a doubt.
[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:36.780]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:37.740]  I love Afghani.
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:38.780]  That's my shit anyways.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:43.340]  But sativas are generally having smaller, you know, like-
[01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:45.420]  I don't know why, but they generally have smaller heads.
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:49.260]  And I've washed some sativas and got some decent results,
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.860]  but I never had a sativa super dump.
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:54.300]  Oji ghost strain haze was a good one.
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:55.900]  The goat gave me that cut.
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:21:00.220]  And that was a, you know, that plant wants to go 12 weeks, dumps hash.
[01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:03.820]  Um, but that's a super rarity.
[01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:08.860]  You know, I think it's definitely more of an indica profile
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.340]  to get those kind of big bulbous heads and stuff.
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:12.540]  You know, that's what we're looking for.
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:13.340]  And not all indicas.
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:17.180]  Do you have any experience with the Himalayan genetics?
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:20.300]  I can't say I've ran anything.
[01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:24.380]  No, those are traditionally hand rubbed.
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:25.180]  Right.
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:26.300]  Hash.
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:30.700]  You know, I heard a really crazy story from my friend from Trinidad,
[01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:33.340]  and he's out doing some work in Jamaica.
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:37.020]  And he said that there was, he was looking for some hash,
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:41.420]  and he came across a little spot, and these guys took him in.
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:46.700]  And they had a plant, sativa plant that would bloom.
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:49.500]  He said it would bloom for eight months out of the year.
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:51.900]  Continuously bloom.
[01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:53.820]  And they would just go back every couple of weeks.
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:55.740]  And rub it.
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:00.460]  And go back in, collect the charis, and sell it.
[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:01.740]  And come back and rub it.
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:02.940]  And it kept blooming.
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:04.860]  I mean, could you imagine if that's your business?
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:06.380]  That's incredible.
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.620]  I've never heard of a plant that bloomed for that long,
[01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:10.060]  and continued to live and grow.
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:11.420]  I mean, right?
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:12.300]  That's kind of crazy.
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:19.980]  So, you know, I guess the sativas have good potential.
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:21.260]  You know, I don't know.
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:23.740]  I smoked some good sativa hash, and it, uh,
[01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:27.260]  these guys up in Canada had some stuff called, uh, Where's My Bike?
[01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:32.220]  And I'm telling you, I took an undab, and I was hammered.
[01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:36.620]  That stuff was heavy.
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:41.660]  Yeah, those smaller trichome heads are an adaptation to the environment.
[01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:42.940]  What's up, Josh?
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:45.100]  What's up, dude?
[01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:46.220]  Josh, what's up?
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.140]  They're smoking that Where's My Bike.
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:48.860]  You remember that?
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:50.300]  I do.
[01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:53.260]  I ran a bunch of that amnesia haze back in the day.
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:54.400]  Yeah.
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:56.060]  Woo, man.
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:23:00.220]  If you find some, some haze hashers, they will, they will zip your head up.
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:02.460]  They will get you high like you've not been high.
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:04.860]  I thought I could handle.
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:05.500]  I could not.
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:08.140]  By the way, this is our, uh, this is our little hash packaging.
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:09.340]  If you're out there and you look at it.
[01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:10.300]  It's beautiful, dude.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:12.480]  Boom.
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:14.860]  Kind of cool.
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:19.580]  I was listening, and I, and I posted a question on chat, and then Peter sent me the link.
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:25.740]  And, um, you were talking about your, your room and I was like, wait, you dry your six star
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:30.620]  melt in, uh, air, air, dry it versus, uh, the freeze dryer.
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:32.320]  Yeah.
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:33.280]  Yeah.
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:39.260]  They got a, and, but, but yeah, you, your, your student, your concept is still the colder
[01:23:39.260 --> 01:23:42.860]  and the dryer, the better you wouldn't rather like delay it out.
[01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:46.700]  Like in terms of like play with that, that humidity and moisture.
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:49.260]  You can extend the dry time.
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:54.940]  You know, I, I think two weeks, I mean, it takes me 10 days to two weeks, you know, and
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.060]  I might be over drying it.
[01:23:56.060 --> 01:23:59.740]  You know, I mean, the most folks I talk to, they, they do it a little quicker, but for
[01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:00.940]  me, I just don't want to rush it.
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.860]  You know, it's, it's not worth rushing.
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:07.100]  Um, and I don't know that, that like slow, you know, like with cannabis, you're going
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:09.500]  to slow dry it to let all of the core feel.
[01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:14.380]  And I think with hash, you don't need to, you know, the, the water is the enemy.
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:16.380]  So get that water out as fast as possible.
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:21.820]  That's why the freeze dryer is great, you know, and you probably come out with a technically
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:23.500]  cleaner hash, right?
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:26.940]  Because it's gone through the freeze dry process through the sublimination process.
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:28.300]  Like there's nothing living in that.
[01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:34.140]  There's no, no kind of, uh, uh, you know, bad shit or pathogenetic stuff in there.
[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:34.380]  Right.
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:39.500]  So, um, so I think you want to get it as, as even on the, on the drying racks, you want
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.260]  to get it dried as fast as possible.
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:42.460]  You know, just get the water out.
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:46.860]  You know, that's so is it, is it, are you making that choice based on like space and
[01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:50.780]  like economy or, or do you prefer the air drive for hash?
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:55.260]  Not, I prefer the air drive for hash, you know, six star.
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:55.820]  I've done it.
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:56.700]  I've done it both ways.
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:01.260]  I put some six star in the, in the freeze dryer and I put the stuff on the racks and
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:06.300]  I just think the stuff on the racks is sexier and it's, it's got more turps.
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:10.460]  I mean, you, you ever, I like, I like my sheets.
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:11.900]  In fact, today I washed my sheets.
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:13.740]  I, I line dried them.
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:14.300]  Okay.
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:18.620]  Line dry your sheets and then dry your sheets in your, your, uh, your machine.
[01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:20.700]  Tell me there's not a difference.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:23.980]  Go just take a shower, go smell what the sheets smell like.
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:24.540]  Right.
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:29.180]  Plus I clean my freeze dryer and it's pulling, you know, I know it's pulling some of those
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:29.820]  turps out.
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:33.340]  You know, I got, I got, I pulled out some of the ice when I cleaned it last week and
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:36.620]  I kept the ice for ice cubes because it smelled crazy.
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:38.860]  It had a heck of turps stuck in it.
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:44.300]  So, um, you know, if I can, if I can just put it on those, those racks and do it that
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:49.020]  way, that's to me, you're, you're getting better turps, you're getting a better, you
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:52.460]  know, less, you know, you're not losing so much, you're not getting anything out of,
[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:56.060]  you know, cause the, the freeze dryers, you know, they kind of smell funny to me a little
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:59.260]  bit, you know, um, as compared to, I've never used one.
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:01.340]  So that's like, that's cool.
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:04.060]  That's music to my ears because I have a cool setup.
[01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:08.860]  You know, that's how Zan, um, Mr. Hotbox taught me how to make cash was.
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:10.460]  Shout out Hotbox!
[01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:12.540]  Yeah, Hotbox is what's up, dude.
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:16.700]  I mean, I lived in the same house that I lived in when I went to college.
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:18.220]  He lived in that same house.
[01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:18.860]  Is that crazy?
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:21.580]  Oh shit, that's crazy with the balcony right there.
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:22.220]  Yeah.
[01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:22.460]  Yeah.
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:25.900]  He showed up at Northwest Roots Fest and we got to talking.
[01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:27.100]  He's like, I'm from Bellingham.
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:28.060]  I was like, me too.
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:29.340]  And, uh, okay.
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:30.540]  Anyways, crazy shit, right?
[01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:31.040]  Small world.
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:32.480]  Are you?
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.640]  I should go ahead.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:40.240]  Are you using like a, a commercial freeze dryer or are you using like a, like a personal
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.440]  at home freeze dryer?
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:43.840]  Any of it will work.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:47.600]  Um, I think that the pharmaceutical ones are kind of the highest grade ones.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:52.720]  You know, you can die there a little more, um, you know, there's a quality difference
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:53.440]  for sure.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.000]  A little bit.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:54.240]  Yeah.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:54.480]  Yeah.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:59.200]  And I, I've got, I've got the big, the, the extra large pharmaceutical, um, just
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.920]  because again, we're hashing everything, you know?
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:07.760]  And I've got, I can grow 30,000, uh, square feet of canopy, you know, at peak.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:12.240]  Um, and next summer we'll do that, you know, this summer we're probably at 15.
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:16.560]  Um, but next summer we'll, we'll probably peak out because just because we've added
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:17.920]  power into our facility.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:19.840]  So do you, you have a harvest, right?
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:21.620]  Yes.
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:27.520]  So it, I was always intrigued by them because like, that's an example of a company that
[01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:32.960]  obviously was like, Whoa, look at all these people buying our gear and like, where are
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:33.920]  they all coming from?
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:40.000]  Uh, but it seems like they're almost like the only company that makes freeze dryers.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.200]  Like, can you think of another company that.
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.440]  They're going to start knocking them off in China.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.920]  Um, but, but yeah, there, I think they got the patent on it and they're the ones doing
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:50.240]  it.
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:55.520]  And, uh, they have to be just like, wow, this is awesome or clueless.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:01.120]  And I think there's other people or I went to Chris Trump's, a Korean natural farming
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.480]  class in Boise, Idaho.
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:09.120]  And day one, halfway through, I, I caught him at lunch break and kind of explained to
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:10.000]  him what was going on.
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.480]  Cause I don't think he had a clue that, you know, 90% of the class was weed farmers, you
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:20.880]  know, and he's holding this thing in Idaho at a church and recovery center.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:22.960]  And it's a bunch of old folks.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:28.320]  And then there's like 90% of us are weed guys, you know, and he just didn't know that that's
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:32.480]  where people were had in new interest and we're trying to come in on it, you know, and,
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.920]  um, I tried my best to like tell the weed guys to like chill out and explain to Chris
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:42.000]  like, dude, there's more coming, you know, um, harvest, right.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.280]  It's got to be like Mecca.
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:45.840]  Yeah.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:46.160]  But harvest.
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:46.880]  Yeah.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:47.200]  But harvest.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:47.680]  Cogramage.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:48.720]  Buy stock in Harvest.
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:54.160]  Cogramage to sit at Chris Trump's feet, learn how to grow amazing weed.
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:55.680]  Yeah.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:56.720]  Harvest Rite's doing good.
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:57.760]  Buy Harvest Rite stock.
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:04.640]  I don't, I don't have any experience with Harvest Rite in particular, but, um, I've
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:09.200]  been to some, some herb farms where they use more commercial grade.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.960]  I mean, we're talking like the size of a semi-trailer for a freeze dryer.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:14.400]  Damn.
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:19.040]  So that's why I asked if it's like a, if it's a personal one, because I know about
[01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:23.200]  the Harvest Rites, but I don't have any experience with them, but there's other businesses out
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:28.640]  there putting out what I would consider commercial grade that it's basically a semi-trailer
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.520]  that they, that's not what they did, but it's that size.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:34.480]  Like you're loading racks on racks on racks into these things.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:40.000]  So that's why I was asking because the herb world takes it to a whole nother level.
[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:44.240]  And I was just interested in if you, if like, if you're rocking something like that, then
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:46.480]  for sure, it's, it's a different ballgame.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:49.360]  So I just wasn't sure if you were aware.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:50.160]  I just wanted to share.
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.720]  Yeah, no, that's, that's wild.
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:53.760]  I was not aware.
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:56.240]  That's crazy shit.
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:30:01.440]  I've seen this, some of those guys doing the, uh, the cryogenic freezing of crops, which
[01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:05.520]  is, you know, they bring in a big nitrogen truck and then they flood the greenhouse.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.280]  And to me, that's, that's really kind of crazy.
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:08.720]  I'm out.
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.640]  Oh, that's yeah.
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.920]  We have our musical guests for the evening.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.840]  So what are you guys dropping right now?
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:23.840]  Are you recording?
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:24.960]  Yeah, we're in the lab right now.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:26.160]  Cooking up some new music.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:34.880]  We smoked the same weed I smoked two nights ago, so if you can't see my eyes, that's part
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:35.440]  of the game.
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:37.640]  I remember that.
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:40.440]  Yo, shout out to Kai, shout out to Ice Wuk.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:43.360]  Two of my peoples right there,
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:46.920]  fucking soul brothers from across the globe.
[01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:49.640]  Yeah, by the way, did we hear from Gilead?
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:53.300]  Have not, he ghosted me.
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.760]  I hope that ghost man though.
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:56.840]  Blue, send me a deck.
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:59.840]  Hey, yo, yo, hey, turn the music down for a second.
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:01.080]  We'll give him a preview.
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.280]  Yo, Kai, what up?
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:07.920]  You dropping that hash knowledge on him?
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:10.560]  Put me on the track, I got flow.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.320]  Let's go, baby.
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:13.280]  Send me something.
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:15.280]  Yeah.
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:16.120]  What's up, bro?
[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.140]  Yeah, this is my man, Jim Thorpe, day one.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.280]  The cartographer.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:22.040]  The cartographer, the map maker.
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:22.960]  I'm the bot.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:26.400]  Is he appreciating the weed that you brought with you?
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.600]  Oh, my man, he's been appreciating the weed
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.080]  that I brought with me for, you know,
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:31.960]  he's my brother since five years old, so.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:33.480]  Actually four years old.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.360]  Yeah, four years old.
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:36.080]  So the weed, you know, what I grow
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:39.560]  is for his endocannabinoid system as well as mine,
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.400]  you know what I'm saying?
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.720]  My twin brother from another mother.
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:46.320]  Yeah, we're part of the same endocannabinoid system,
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.960]  if that makes sense.
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:51.920]  Are you, do you make hash?
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:53.960]  Do I make hash?
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:58.120]  I make, no, mainly dry sift, you know what I'm saying?
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:01.240]  Like, you know, I don't like to get my cannabinoids wet
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:04.320]  if I can help it, you know.
[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:06.640]  Only because it's just easier to work with,
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:09.560]  but I have been, my friends have been telling me
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.440]  that all my dry sift has been melting down
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.680]  into a glob inside their container,
[01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:18.040]  so that's promising, you know what I'm saying?
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.800]  I'm no hash maker, but I know that's a good thing,
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.200]  so you know what I'm saying?
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:25.080]  Was that a humble brag?
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:27.920]  I mean, I don't know, I don't know.
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.640]  Honestly, I'm too ignorant to,
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.400]  too dumb to brag on this one.
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:34.000]  For real, though.
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.600]  Hey, let's give away some packs.
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:37.720]  All right.
[01:32:37.720 --> 01:32:39.000]  Let's give away some. Say again?
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.880]  He's gonna give away some packs.
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.760]  All right, but how do we pick winners?
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.560]  Give away some of that Matterhorn player,
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:48.600]  that shit looks tasty.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.440]  I second that.
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:53.120]  Let me pull something out here real quick.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:54.000]  Oh, is that Josh?
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:54.840]  What up, Josh?
[01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.560]  Yeah, what's up, dude, how you doing?
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.920]  Good, man.
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:00.360]  Love, I love that garden tour last week, man.
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:03.520]  You are, you're a man after my own heart,
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:06.080]  and you love that good beer like I do, too, so.
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.200]  Yes, sir.
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:11.240]  Oh, dude, hopefully we can get past this COVID shit
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:13.520]  and come hang out with you guys, man.
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:14.360]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:17.360]  I'm thinking about going out there, fuck COVID.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.560]  I wanna get out.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:23.360]  I feel like our climate and our longitude and latitude
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:28.360]  is so similar that I think we breathe the same air,
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:29.640]  you know what I'm saying?
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.880]  Yeah, there are lots of places I wanna go,
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:34.480]  and then I'm like, ah, but I have two kids.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:37.800]  I'm willing to risk it all, man.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:39.600]  Take them with you.
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.840]  Like, I'm always like, I'd love to just like
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:45.800]  spend the whole summer up like meandering through Humboldt
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.520]  and Sonoma and Mendocino, and then I'm like,
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:51.240]  ah, but I can't do that because I have two kids.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:55.080]  All right, I wanna give a shout out, if Don Slug,
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:58.600]  Don Slug on IG, if you're out there, if you're watching,
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.480]  you just won some shit, send me a.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:04.640]  Wait, so how did we pick Don Slug?
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.960]  Don's, well, I had announced on Instagram
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.520]  we were doing this and asked people.
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:09.360]  Ah, right.
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:12.440]  So I'm just going through and kind of just,
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.640]  hey, if you tag somebody, maybe you were the first one
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.960]  to tag somebody and jump in.
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:19.240]  Yeah, let me look on the.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:21.480]  I'm gonna hook you up with a free pack,
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.360]  and I'm gonna send you out one of these root scars too.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.400]  Let's give him a pack, so he can see.
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:28.720]  Oh, for chance.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:36.880]  So which post was that?
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:40.800]  That was on my roots with a Z.
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:44.440]  Wrong one, yeah.
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:47.960]  So I got two accounts.
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:51.240]  I got roots with a Z, which is shadow banned.
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:54.680]  I cannot post anything remotely related to cannabis,
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:55.760]  or they flag it.
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:58.920]  I like reject all of them that they send out
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:00.160]  and they repost them,
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.400]  but I still can't post anything on there.
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.640]  And then roots with the S underscore,
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:06.880]  and I can post the weed stuff there.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.600]  They haven't found me.
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.280]  The original account was actually deleted.
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:13.920]  So yeah, the algorithm doesn't like me.
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:16.360]  So which guy, which guy did you pick?
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.800]  His name is Don Slug, at Don Slug.
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:22.480]  Hold on, let me find him.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:24.200]  Maybe he's on the other one, hold on.
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.960]  Sorry, that one's on the S underscore account.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:29.960]  Damn you.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.160]  I'm gonna go back, back, back.
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:37.680]  Ah, here we go, all right.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:40.040]  Boom, it's the first one to jump on there.
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.160]  Don Slug and he tagged me.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.160]  And hey, Brada Blake, if you're on here too,
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:51.160]  shoot me an email at the,
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:56.920]  at the nw47 at gmail.com,
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:01.720]  nw, the nw47 at gmail.com,
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.840]  and I'll send you a pack as well.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.080]  You also have to watch like two hours
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:10.800]  into this conversation to find that email address.
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.280]  Right.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:15.280]  But anybody who knows Don Slug or Brada Blake.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.880]  Yeah, you could let those guys know,
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:18.040]  you'd be a good friend.
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.480]  Let me pick somebody else off the other list here.
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:27.900]  And then do we have any questions?
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:28.740]  Let me,
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:38.580]  I'm scrolling through.
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:39.820]  All right, here's another one.
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:42.540]  Let's go, ifarmorgan.
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:44.300]  And I'll send these guys a little message
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:45.140]  on the Instagram too,
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:47.940]  in case they didn't make it through this much.
[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:49.100]  And we'll hook them up.
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:56.420]  Ifarmorgan, we're gonna hook you up too with a pack.
[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:02.460]  And he's-
[01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:04.580]  So, by the way, go ahead.
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:05.780]  We'll hook Toby up too.
[01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:11.540]  So how many, how many different lines
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:13.820]  are you running this season?
[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:15.500]  Like what, what do you,
[01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:19.700]  and are you growing only for hash
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:21.460]  or are you also growing for flour?
[01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:25.860]  Right now it's strictly for hash.
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:27.260]  The way the market is set up here,
[01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:29.300]  it's just literally too expensive
[01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:31.740]  for us to even process everything into flours,
[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:33.060]  get it tested, trim it up,
[01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:38.060]  put it in a fucking jar and sell it for $14 an inch.
[01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:43.300]  If there weren't the regulatory market distortions,
[01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:46.380]  would you wanna have flour as well?
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:47.220]  Absolutely.
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:48.060]  Okay.
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:48.900]  And they're trying to fix that.
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:51.660]  Right now the state takes us a 35% excise tax
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:54.060]  plus about a 10% sales tax.
[01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:57.860]  So you're talking 45% of our gross is going to the state.
[01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:59.020]  That's rough.
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:37:59.980]  They're trying to bring-
[01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:00.980]  It's amazing.
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:01.820]  That's amazing.
[01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:02.660]  You wanna play poker?
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:05.100]  I'm gonna take 45% of every pot.
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:05.940]  Okay.
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:08.820]  So, but they're trying to bring that 35% down to 20%,
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:10.820]  which will allow us to move into that.
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:13.140]  But right now it's just more feasible.
[01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:14.420]  Plus this is what we do.
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:17.220]  So in our light depth
[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:21.180]  and in our two Hugelkultur greenhouses, it's all hashers.
[01:38:21.180 --> 01:38:22.860]  It's our bread and butter.
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:24.540]  It's our strawberry yogurt.
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:26.660]  It's our hamma hamma.
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:30.740]  There's some coffee in there, some pinkleberries,
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:32.820]  mostly the hash strains that we're running.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:34.660]  And then out in the yard, we've got some of those,
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:37.220]  but we're also testing a lot of seed in the yard,
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:39.700]  which is full sun stuff.
[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:42.740]  So we've got some jelly roll from Itaw Foundation.
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:46.980]  I've got a couple rows of that strawberry yogurt,
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:48.980]  crossed with a Ferula glue,
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:52.340]  which is a Gorilla glue crossed with our fog,
[01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:54.660]  which is freeze times OG.
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:57.260]  And then we also have a chocolate tie
[01:38:57.260 --> 01:38:58.500]  crossed with that Ferula glue.
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:01.340]  So we've got like, you know, a hundred plants in each row.
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:03.540]  So we've got rows of those.
[01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:05.380]  I'm running some old Dominion,
[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:09.620]  some of his Polecat 91,
[01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:11.620]  some of his, it's a hash plant,
[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:13.020]  a skunk hash plant, we're calling it.
[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:15.260]  It's got a Skelly hash plant,
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:16.300]  a Bee Wiz,
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:20.380]  and the dad is that Super Sativa Seed Company's
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:21.940]  skunk number one.
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:24.940]  So we're running all that stuff out in the yard.
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:26.740]  From green source, we've got the pinkleberry,
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:28.340]  we've got pinkleberry times coffee,
[01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:30.820]  which I call them the coffee berry.
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:33.780]  I bred some, like a reverse breeding of that.
[01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:36.260]  I use their pinkleberry that I found in seeds,
[01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:37.380]  crossed it to my coffee,
[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:38.380]  and we have those running too,
[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:40.300]  we're calling those the pea berry.
[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:42.620]  So we're doing, you know, we're doing testing out there.
[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:44.060]  And those, some of those will get mixed
[01:39:44.060 --> 01:39:47.380]  and blended into different hash combinations as well.
[01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:48.660]  But yeah, everything in the yard
[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:50.420]  should hash really great this year.
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:53.260]  That's the plan.
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:55.100]  And then,
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:01.420]  and then we'll move to indoor production in the fall.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:03.860]  We've got three big indoor rooms.
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:07.100]  And then when we go to the indoor rooms,
[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:09.580]  we'll probably do more of the flower stuff
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:12.420]  because we can charge more at that point.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:13.460]  You know, again, it's just,
[01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:15.060]  it's just kind of the way that the market's set up.
[01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:17.620]  Well, so, but you like washing outdoor
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:19.660]  more than indoor, right?
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:21.140]  I like washing it all, but yeah,
[01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:22.500]  I prefer the outdoor stuff.
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:26.060]  I just think that it yields better, it tastes better.
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:27.820]  You know, but even our indoor stuff, you know,
[01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:31.620]  we're growing, right now we're using pots and soil
[01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:33.180]  and just making teas.
[01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:35.420]  We might even try some of that avocado tech.
[01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:37.660]  Yes.
[01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:38.660]  Yeah.
[01:40:44.130 --> 01:40:46.530]  But yeah, yeah, we, we, like the last year,
[01:40:46.530 --> 01:40:48.010]  we were only operating on 200 amps
[01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:49.450]  and we just got a thousand amp drop.
[01:40:49.450 --> 01:40:52.730]  So we're going to light up the big,
[01:40:52.730 --> 01:40:54.290]  yeah, the big barn at our facility.
[01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:56.970]  So you can go to 11 this season.
[01:40:56.970 --> 01:40:58.250]  Boom.
[01:40:58.250 --> 01:40:59.290]  Yeah. We're, we're trying to hit
[01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:01.050]  that 30,000 square foot canopy.
[01:41:01.050 --> 01:41:05.610]  And we put heated beds in the greenhouse this year.
[01:41:05.610 --> 01:41:07.690]  That looked good, you guys did a good job.
[01:41:07.690 --> 01:41:09.170]  Yeah. Got the heated beds in there.
[01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:13.090]  Josh, you were the one that kind of encouraged us to do that.
[01:41:13.090 --> 01:41:16.250]  And, and we got it all, you know, it's got a really cool,
[01:41:16.250 --> 01:41:17.690]  like the insulated on top.
[01:41:17.690 --> 01:41:20.290]  So we're never going to turn that greenhouse off again.
[01:41:20.290 --> 01:41:22.130]  And that's a 3000 square foot greenhouse
[01:41:22.130 --> 01:41:24.490]  plus the three indoor bloom rooms.
[01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:25.450]  So we'll be able to run the greenhouse.
[01:41:25.450 --> 01:41:28.130]  So in the winter, you'll be able to run the greenhouse.
[01:41:28.130 --> 01:41:28.970]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:29.810]  And again, there's only, you know,
[01:41:29.810 --> 01:41:31.730]  there's only four of us guys out there and we got,
[01:41:31.730 --> 01:41:35.090]  you know, one or two helpers and we want to keep it small.
[01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:36.130]  We want to keep it tight.
[01:41:36.130 --> 01:41:37.970]  I'm not, you know, we're not trying to go bigger
[01:41:38.010 --> 01:41:39.570]  and we're not trying to give them what we can handle.
[01:41:39.570 --> 01:41:41.530]  And once we get our processes dialed, you know,
[01:41:41.530 --> 01:41:44.050]  then we might push it a little bit, but, you know,
[01:41:44.050 --> 01:41:47.250]  we're happy taking our time and just, you know,
[01:41:47.250 --> 01:41:51.170]  not trying to play the volume game and instead playing,
[01:41:52.210 --> 01:41:54.370]  you know, playing the quality game and playing that card.
[01:41:54.370 --> 01:41:56.730]  Cause that's, that's really our card to play.
[01:41:56.730 --> 01:42:00.650]  Are you heating those beds with the heated water lines?
[01:42:00.650 --> 01:42:01.490]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:04.530]  It's got a, what are those called Josh?
[01:42:04.530 --> 01:42:05.370]  Pex.
[01:42:05.370 --> 01:42:06.290]  Pex. Yeah.
[01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:07.170]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:42:07.170 --> 01:42:11.090]  We got Pex lines and, and, and a manifold that heats it.
[01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:13.250]  And the manifold can actually do double what we've got.
[01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:15.410]  So, you know, whatever we make this year,
[01:42:15.410 --> 01:42:17.290]  we'll probably invest in another big light depth
[01:42:17.290 --> 01:42:18.650]  and do that again.
[01:42:20.530 --> 01:42:22.450]  And Josh is multitasking.
[01:42:22.450 --> 01:42:25.530]  He's talking and cloning at the same time.
[01:42:25.530 --> 01:42:27.930]  So what do you, what do you,
[01:42:27.930 --> 01:42:29.810]  what is worth cloning tonight?
[01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:30.850]  What are you cloning?
[01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:34.370]  These are males, Skyjago males.
[01:42:34.410 --> 01:42:37.210]  I have three, three I selected.
[01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:41.850]  And I'm still searching for the fucking root beer.
[01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:46.770]  Jackson's got me on the wild goose chase.
[01:42:49.090 --> 01:42:51.130]  I popped out, I don't know, the Skyjago,
[01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:52.490]  probably four or 500.
[01:42:52.490 --> 01:42:54.690]  He's like, oh dude, you're going to find it.
[01:42:54.690 --> 01:42:56.970]  So on the stem rub for the males,
[01:42:58.410 --> 01:43:00.530]  I didn't, I don't think I found it.
[01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:03.410]  There's still another, probably 20 or 30 to go through.
[01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:07.050]  So we'll see on the females, stay tuned.
[01:43:08.050 --> 01:43:10.090]  I want that coffee times root beer.
[01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:13.250]  Sarsaparilla, sarsaparilla.
[01:43:14.210 --> 01:43:15.730]  Oh, I like that.
[01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:19.930]  I can't tell you, but who, but a rumor is
[01:43:19.930 --> 01:43:21.770]  I got a buddy that's got one of those for me.
[01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:23.370]  So we'll see what happens.
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:28.200]  Might be coming sooner than you think.
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.800]  Hey Blue, can we hear your music on YouTube or anything?
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:34.080]  Where can we go listen to some tracks?
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:37.040]  Or live right now?
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.720]  Yeah, I mean, we are live right now.
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:39.680]  I can take you inside.
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:42.440]  I'm standing outside the spot just cause it's super loud.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:45.960]  But definitely go into YouTube and look up
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:49.240]  Green Tank album is called Sky People.
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:52.000]  And it's a few years old, but it's one of my favorite works.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.480]  And I think anybody who smokes cannabis will like it.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:58.720]  It's called Green Tank, one word, Sky People, one word.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:03.640]  And you're all already on YouTube right now.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.960]  So it's really easy to go check it out.
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:07.000]  Yeah, yeah, do it.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.080]  But that's one of my favorite.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:11.960]  It's a little more spaced out, ethereal,
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:14.200]  underground, hip hop, lyrical.
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:15.040]  So how about this?
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:18.760]  What kind of, what are your hip hop influences?
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:22.200]  I mean, the forefathers, I like, you know,
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:27.200]  Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, Guru, you know, AKA Gangstar.
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:30.040]  You know, original East Coast, you know,
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:32.880]  Jay Ruth, The Damaja, Onyx, everybody.
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:33.720]  You know what I mean?
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.680]  Like that's my thing is early nineties to the late nineties.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.720]  And then it fell off and got shiny suit,
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:43.200]  rapper type things, the way the cannabis industry has.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.440]  I see a lot of parallels between hip hop
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:46.520]  and the cannabis industry,
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:51.240]  because I've been in this shit since 1991 or two,
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:53.720]  something like that, where I first realized I had balls
[01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.680]  and, you know, they dropped
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:58.200]  and I wanted to listen to hip hop music and smoke weed.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:02.280]  So Redman and Methadone and Wu-Tang Clan
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:04.280]  and that shit was in my ear.
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:06.800]  Far Side, De La Soul.
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.160]  Absolutely, man.
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:09.000]  I had-
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  I reached out to DJ Premier to come on with Dan Pomerantz.
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:15.360]  What?
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.120]  I've been reaching out to different people.
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:23.400]  Cause this is what like, imagine like everyone's here,
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:26.720]  like smoking weed, getting high, like talking, having fun.
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:28.840]  And then it's like DJ Premier, like.
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:32.200]  I mean, yeah, absolutely.
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:33.720]  Yeah. I'll give you a list of people
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:35.280]  I'd like to see, that's for sure.
[01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:36.480]  But yeah, no, I'm a fan.
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:37.320]  I'm a fan.
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:40.600]  And that translated into a, into, you know,
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.920]  I guess the MC by the time I was 14.
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:45.880]  And I've been doing that as a sidebar, but you know,
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:47.960]  been growing cannabis the whole time too.
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:50.200]  So it's just, you know, it's fun.
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:53.440]  It's love all, you know, intertwined, you know?
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:56.360]  So, yeah, but it definitely, we have that.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.240]  Of course we've got some joints on iTunes.
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:00.480]  We have one called a Riddle of Steel,
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:02.520]  which is modeled after, whoa, what happened?
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:03.560]  We lost the light.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:08.640]  Riddle of Steel was modeled after like Conan,
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:11.040]  the Barbarian, which is one of my favorite flicks.
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:11.880]  Oh yeah, Conan.
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:13.200]  We did a whole mantra to that.
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.040]  So if you listen to Riddle of Steel.
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:15.120]  Bro, I got the Conan.
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:16.960]  I'm gonna go get that shit right now.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:17.800]  Bet me I got it.
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:18.640]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:20.480]  Bet me I got it, watch, I'll be right back.
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:21.320]  Hold on.
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:22.240]  Do it.
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:24.880]  Yo, but like, yeah, we, you know,
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:26.920]  we're weed smokers at heart.
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:29.880]  So we modeled our music after that,
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:33.440]  but we're also, you know, eclectic and friendly folks.
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:36.440]  And so we got a lot of different kind of looks basically,
[01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:39.240]  but yeah, we grew up on all that real hip hop.
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:42.400]  People are, someone was talking about Onyx.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:43.680]  Yes.
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:46.240]  Back the fuck up, back the fuck up.
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:49.000]  Yeah, the bald head invasion.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.440]  I mean, that was when I was, you know,
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:51.320]  I was in high school.
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:53.520]  I was probably like 14 years old or some shit like that.
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:55.360]  So very influenced by that.
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:59.320]  But it's relevant because the way that I grow
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:03.120]  has threads connected to some of the music
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:03.960]  that I listen to.
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.880]  And if anybody who's a real cultivator knows,
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:07.640]  like man, like, you know.
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:12.680]  It influences the way you talk to the plants, straight up.
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:17.040]  I put on the same fucking album
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.280]  every time I go to select males
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:23.040]  and I like smoke a joint and drink a beer
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:24.560]  and put on the same album
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:27.480]  and like get in this fucking mood where I'm just like,
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.480]  I'm not into hip hop.
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:29.600]  I'm like from the Northwest.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:32.080]  So I'm like right into rock and roll, but yeah.
[01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:34.040]  I love rock and roll, yeah.
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:37.040]  But for sure, like it's like something about
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:39.440]  connecting all those senses and getting it lined up.
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:41.560]  Wait, so what song do you put on?
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:45.800]  Well, I play a Dr. Dog album, a series of Dr. Dog.
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:47.840]  Fuck yeah, yo, I know he has.
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:49.880]  Yeah, I love the dog, man, for sure.
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:51.520]  I used to play a lot of music.
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:54.720]  When I got into weed and I actually backed off of it
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:58.200]  because I just, I don't know.
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:47:59.440]  As you're talking about it, I'm just like,
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:02.360]  oh fuck man, you're connected with my heart right there.
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:04.320]  So it's cool to hear you talk about it.
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:07.720]  I mean, we have a lot of different connections too.
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:10.440]  Like one of our good friends is Jeff Coffin
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:13.200]  who is the saxophonist for Dave Matthews Band.
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:15.840]  Like a very good friend, personal friend.
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:18.720]  And also Nigel Hall, who's the lead singer for Lettuce
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.600]  who's a complete funk band.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:21.520]  You know what I mean?
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:23.360]  Like completely different vibes,
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:28.360]  but that space in between, you know what I'm saying?
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:31.960]  That place where you are grooving
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:34.000]  is where you draw those picks out of.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.240]  And that shit is meant to be, man.
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:38.640]  I mean, it sounds cheesy, but it is what it is.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:41.840]  Not just hip hop, not just rock and roll,
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:43.000]  blues, whatever you want.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.120]  But it's when you're in that little groove
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:48.680]  that your mind is thinking on the right train.
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:52.680]  And that's when you make selections, you make choices,
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:55.280]  you observe things about the plant.
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:57.280]  And it's a vibe.
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:02.280]  A lot of us got into this lifestyle because of that.
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:07.280]  We were a little bit more in tune than other folks
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:11.320]  and it was, we're gonna make it happen.
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:12.800]  For sure, it's not a mistake.
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:15.480]  It's that we have the same type of observational skills
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:17.160]  that made us like one thing
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:19.520]  that might make us like a strain or an aroma
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:23.920]  or a growing pattern or whatever it might be.
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:26.720]  Might be the same as a guitar riff or a drum hit
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:27.800]  or whatever it might be.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:28.680]  It's the same thing.
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:31.480]  It's little intricacies that, you know,
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:32.440]  that's what growing is.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:34.080]  Noticing the little tiny things
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:37.160]  and putting it all together to make one song.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:40.920]  So what are your thoughts on modern kind of hip hop
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:42.480]  that's all over the radio?
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:47.120]  I mean, honestly, I hear creativity.
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:48.760]  I hear music.
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:49.920]  I hear musicality.
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.720]  I don't hear, you know, I mean, a lot of, you know,
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:54.280]  if you're chasing a trend,
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:56.600]  it's the same thing as a hype strain.
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:57.560]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:00.600]  If you're chasing money, it's obvious,
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:03.080]  whether it's music or weed, like, I mean,
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:07.080]  use your heart when you get in this shit, come on.
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:08.200]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:09.840]  Yeah, I like that.
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:11.960]  It's what it is.
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.880]  I can't call it any other way.
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:16.280]  Where's that Conan?
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:17.120]  You got it?
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:18.360]  Wow, bow to no man.
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:19.200]  Oh, man.
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.640]  We've gone like Conan.
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:23.120]  Riddle of steel.
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:25.360]  For real, though.
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.680]  Do you and your wife roll with Conan?
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:33.240]  Actually, we like to go to the medieval fest.
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:34.720]  They get the medieval fest right here.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:38.760]  So we go medieval fest and yeah, get medieval with it.
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:41.360]  Hell yeah, bro.
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:42.200]  We did it.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:44.240]  We actually did, my band did a joint
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:46.280]  called Turkey Legs and Kegs.
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:49.200]  And what it was, we had, for real,
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:53.120]  we cooked off, I cooked off probably 300 turkey legs.
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:56.960]  We got kegs of mead and we got kegs of perry,
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:58.560]  which is pear cider.
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:02.480]  So we got the most like medieval type of drinks
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:05.080]  we could have going on and we cooked only turkey legs.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:06.400]  So if you wanted food at the joint,
[01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:07.800]  that's all you got was the turkey legs.
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:10.320]  And by the way, how is mead?
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:11.440]  Mead is delicious, man.
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:13.720]  It's fermented honey.
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:15.120]  So yeah.
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:18.920]  I got the biggest pear tree you've ever seen in my backyard
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:20.800]  and I'm probably gonna pull down, I don't know,
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:22.600]  a couple of hundred pears this year.
[01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:24.880]  So I'm gonna sign this up.
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:26.960]  Put them in a vessel and ferment them.
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:28.400]  What's the perry recipe?
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.680]  I'll hit you up, I'll hit you up.
[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:31.640]  I got that, I got that.
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:33.080]  We're cider makers out here, heavy.
[01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:34.320]  I'm not such a cider maker,
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.200]  but I got so many cider maker heads
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:38.600]  that I'll give you a perry recipe all day.
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:42.600]  But just be careful, don't take too much of it.
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:44.840]  I'm actually cloning over about a hundred gallons
[01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:46.000]  of cider right now.
[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:48.760]  From a year and a half, yeah.
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:52.400]  But don't drink too much of that perry
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:55.760]  because it's got this undigestible sugar inside of it
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:58.400]  that if you ingest too much of it,
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:51:59.800]  you're not gonna digest it.
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:00.960]  It's gonna go straight through.
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:02.480]  So you gotta be careful with the perry,
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:04.240]  but mix it with the mead.
[01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:07.360]  That's why we do 50-50 mead, perry, mead, perry.
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:10.000]  You're glowing at the end of the night.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:11.480]  So.
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:13.560]  Just before I got into cannabis,
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.040]  I was this close to going commercial
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:18.200]  into cider and mead making.
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:19.040]  Yeah.
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:21.920]  I'm down to help you, Kai, if you want some help, man.
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:24.520]  Let's do it, come out.
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:25.360]  Yeah, I'll help you, bro.
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:27.160]  They're almost ready to harvest.
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:28.640]  Press that shit.
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:29.480]  Yeah, I got it.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:31.120]  All these things are so interconnected, bro.
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:34.160]  Like as far as just like sense of place,
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:36.440]  you know, specific, ah, damn, I should've done it again.
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:39.080]  But all these things are so key.
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:39.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:42.000]  You know, fermenting, Korean natural farming,
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.840]  it's all a bunch of fermenting stuff, you know?
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:46.040]  So yeah, same thing.
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.000]  I see it as the same as single source hash.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:48.880]  It's the same idea.
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:52.640]  Like one place, one process, one product.
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:54.480]  That is great.
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:55.320]  Blam.
[01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:56.480]  It all goes back to terroir,
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:57.840]  no matter what you're talking about
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:00.440]  when it comes to this kind of stuff, so.
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:01.280]  True indeed.
[01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:03.440]  Well, I'm gonna step back in.
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:04.960]  I actually have a verse to do right now.
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:06.840]  These guys are waiting on me to go get in the booth
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:07.960]  and do a verse for my song.
[01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:10.320]  But if you want, I'll pop you on
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:12.880]  for a little bit of vocal preview.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:15.760]  But otherwise, I promise I'll post something on Instagram.
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:17.480]  So follow me, at Blue Avery Tank,
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:19.480]  because I always post my music Mondays on that.
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:21.160]  But man, I love you guys.
[01:53:21.160 --> 01:53:22.680]  You guys are fucking geese.
[01:53:22.680 --> 01:53:23.520]  What's up?
[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:24.360]  What's up, man?
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.200]  See ya.
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:26.040]  And I'm locked out.
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:26.880]  That's the other thing too.
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:29.160]  I'm at the studio and I am locked out.
[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:32.120]  I supply the weed, motherfuckers.
[01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:32.960]  Let me in.
[01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:34.800]  Let me in, bro.
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:36.080]  Take the weed man.
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:38.960]  Well, the weed's inside, so they don't need you.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:40.920]  Exactly, I'm locked out.
[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:42.560]  My weed's inside, I'm outside.
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:43.560]  They don't need me.
[01:53:46.830 --> 01:53:48.590]  So, wait.
[01:53:48.590 --> 01:53:50.870]  So Josh, did you,
[01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:54.470]  we were talking about what you're cloning
[01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:56.310]  and you said you were doing the males
[01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:58.710]  and what were you selecting for?
[01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:02.830]  I was looking for,
[01:54:02.830 --> 01:54:05.270]  so I was looking through, these were the SkyJarrows
[01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:08.510]  and I'm taking the guidance of Jackson,
[01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:10.790]  me and Gene, they're his beans.
[01:54:11.710 --> 01:54:14.230]  So he's cool enough to talk to me
[01:54:14.230 --> 01:54:16.670]  for like an hour and a half, two hours,
[01:54:16.670 --> 01:54:18.990]  as I select through each string.
[01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:20.630]  It's really cool.
[01:54:20.630 --> 01:54:25.030]  But it's a typical OG
[01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:27.030]  and that's why I was so stoked on it
[01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:29.870]  is the way he described it to me
[01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:31.630]  is it's kind of a tool that I can go
[01:54:31.630 --> 01:54:34.910]  and throw different flavors on the female.
[01:54:35.670 --> 01:54:36.990]  Or the male.
[01:54:36.990 --> 01:54:39.830]  And kind of just like use the form
[01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:41.990]  and the stack of the OG and have the gas
[01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:43.990]  and kind of that, some of that stuff in there,
[01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:46.470]  but dump some other flavors on.
[01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:50.150]  But if you go through enough numbers,
[01:54:50.150 --> 01:54:52.430]  the Jarrow has the root beer in it.
[01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:55.870]  And that's where the root beer was pulled out of the Jarrow.
[01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:59.190]  So that's what I got really excited about
[01:54:59.190 --> 01:55:00.950]  was I'm looking through numbers of it.
[01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:02.710]  And so I'm hoping to find,
[01:55:02.710 --> 01:55:05.830]  so I'm looking through, morphologically,
[01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:08.550]  I'm looking through stuff that has seven fingers
[01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:10.670]  versus the five finger OG stuff.
[01:55:10.670 --> 01:55:12.750]  And then trying to stem rub those
[01:55:12.750 --> 01:55:15.390]  and find stuff that's a little more interesting
[01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:17.350]  and going in those directions.
[01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:21.310]  So these are rooted.
[01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:24.230]  So they were, I made those selections three weeks ago.
[01:55:24.230 --> 01:55:25.510]  So I have to go back to my notes
[01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:28.590]  to see exactly what the rubs were
[01:55:28.590 --> 01:55:29.430]  and why I selected those.
[01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:31.390]  Because I can't remember at this point.
[01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:36.190]  Just quickly, Kaya,
[01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:42.430]  Tara asked what your product retails for in Washington
[01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:44.830]  and how the laws need to change.
[01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:47.750]  So farms can sell directly to consumers
[01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:49.990]  or at least medical patients.
[01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:52.550]  Yeah, I think they're working on that.
[01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:55.230]  There was talk about letting the smaller farms do that.
[01:55:55.230 --> 01:55:56.510]  I consider us a smaller farm,
[01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:58.910]  but we have the biggest license available.
[01:55:58.910 --> 01:56:01.110]  So hopefully we'll let everybody do that.
[01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:02.350]  Arbor spot would be great for that.
[01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:04.270]  It's kind of a location spot anyways.
[01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:08.310]  I don't know what it's gonna take to change the laws.
[01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:10.470]  I don't know that they have much compulsion
[01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:12.590]  or will to do that.
[01:56:12.590 --> 01:56:13.430]  It kind of sucks.
[01:56:14.590 --> 01:56:16.230]  Yeah, they're taking too much of the pie
[01:56:16.230 --> 01:56:18.270]  and that ultimately hurts the producers
[01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:19.350]  and the end consumers.
[01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:22.550]  Right now, I think you can find our stuff
[01:56:23.470 --> 01:56:25.670]  75 bucks a gram for the hash.
[01:56:29.110 --> 01:56:31.030]  On sale, they have super sales or whatever,
[01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:32.710]  maybe $60 a gram.
[01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:35.990]  And then the flowers,
[01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:39.950]  we make deals with whoever's selling it at the stores,
[01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:42.030]  $40 or an eighth.
[01:56:42.030 --> 01:56:44.590]  And that's all we sell is eighths in the flowers.
[01:56:44.590 --> 01:56:47.670]  So probably hard pressed to find the flowers right now,
[01:56:47.670 --> 01:56:49.910]  but the hash, we just had a big drop.
[01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:51.950]  On the East side, there's some in Yakima.
[01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:56.070]  We're working on getting out to the Tri-Cities
[01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:57.470]  and then it's all over Seattle.
[01:56:57.470 --> 01:57:00.030]  And I want the kids up into the Olympic Games
[01:57:00.030 --> 01:57:01.230]  where they're based.
[01:57:02.230 --> 01:57:05.190]  Call me son before you go to Tri-Cities.
[01:57:05.190 --> 01:57:06.030]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:09.350]  There's some vipers out there and that's where I'm from.
[01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:10.470]  Okay, okay.
[01:57:11.550 --> 01:57:13.150]  I got you.
[01:57:13.150 --> 01:57:15.950]  So yeah, that's where you can find our stuff.
[01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:18.750]  I generally will post up the different stores and stuff
[01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:20.150]  if you're following my feed.
[01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:23.550]  Either one of them, I try to keep that updated.
[01:57:23.550 --> 01:57:26.990]  So shout out the stores that are carrying us.
[01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:29.110]  Salish Coastal.
[01:57:29.150 --> 01:57:32.230]  That's kind of one of our native partners, Cedar Greens.
[01:57:34.710 --> 01:57:38.110]  Nature's Gifts and Squim, Olympia Weed Company,
[01:57:38.110 --> 01:57:41.550]  Yakima Weed Company, Freedom Clutch.
[01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:45.030]  There's a lot out there.
[01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:47.430]  Appreciate you guys supporting us.
[01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:49.710]  Do you have any stores up here in Bellingham?
[01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:54.230]  Cannazone is probably the closest and furthest North.
[01:57:54.230 --> 01:57:56.150]  Ooh, Hyperbole, shout out Hyperbole.
[01:57:57.150 --> 01:57:59.510]  Yeah, Cannazone I think is in Mount Vernon,
[01:57:59.510 --> 01:58:01.510]  which is probably as close as we've got.
[01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:04.710]  We'll get back into Satori and stuff probably this fall
[01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:06.790]  when we've got more product to offer.
[01:58:09.190 --> 01:58:13.590]  And seeds are always available at Seeds Here Now,
[01:58:13.590 --> 01:58:17.590]  Neptune Seed Bank, Heavily Connected,
[01:58:17.590 --> 01:58:20.990]  the Rio Rocky Mountain High, the Seed Page.
[01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:23.470]  Shout out all the seed banks that have helped us out
[01:58:23.470 --> 01:58:24.550]  throughout the years.
[01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:27.630]  Seed Games kind of crazy too.
[01:58:27.630 --> 01:58:29.750]  That's a whole nother ball of wax as well.
[01:58:31.470 --> 01:58:33.510]  Yeah, we've been hanging on through the medical
[01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:35.950]  and just trying to keep pushing.
[01:58:35.950 --> 01:58:38.110]  So that's all we can do and keep supporting each other
[01:58:38.110 --> 01:58:42.030]  and keep building content because everybody
[01:58:42.030 --> 01:58:44.790]  that's present tonight and the folks that are watching,
[01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:48.950]  you guys included, everyone of you in the comment section,
[01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:50.910]  you're all like part of the culture.
[01:58:51.070 --> 01:58:54.870]  You're what makes us us and you're the glue
[01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:56.630]  that keeps us together.
[01:58:56.630 --> 01:58:59.430]  And the more we hold on to that and foster that
[01:58:59.430 --> 01:59:01.950]  and care for it, the better off we're gonna be
[01:59:01.950 --> 01:59:04.710]  when the culture vultures and the corporate pricks come in
[01:59:04.710 --> 01:59:08.190]  and chads and try to take our spot
[01:59:08.190 --> 01:59:09.550]  because this is our spot.
[01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:11.150]  I've been doing this since I was 18.
[01:59:11.150 --> 01:59:12.510]  This is how I feed my family.
[01:59:12.510 --> 01:59:14.190]  This is how I connect with the most high.
[01:59:14.190 --> 01:59:17.830]  This is a sacred plant.
[01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:20.870]  And we do right to take care of it
[01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:22.910]  and take care of each other along the way.
[01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:24.150]  Sorry to preach you, but.
[01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:28.670]  Can you talk about kind of the current state
[01:59:28.670 --> 01:59:32.030]  of the seed game and like kind of how it's evolved
[01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:34.590]  and things you've seen over time?
[01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:38.350]  Again-
[01:59:38.350 --> 01:59:40.430]  Do you like where it is right now?
[01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:41.830]  I'm not mad at it.
[01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:46.350]  I mean, I see a lot of people figuring out how to hustle
[01:59:46.350 --> 01:59:47.630]  and use it a little bit.
[01:59:47.630 --> 01:59:50.430]  And when I got into it, it was,
[01:59:50.430 --> 01:59:53.750]  I had a mentor, Lemon Hoko, male, this old timer.
[01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:58.190]  And I came from a family that did game foul breeding,
[01:59:58.190 --> 02:00:01.510]  chicken fighting, breeding, and hound breeding for hunting.
[02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:06.270]  And having a mentor, they teach you about
[02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:10.550]  respecting certain rules and certain principles
[02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:11.910]  of getting into it.
[02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:13.470]  And I think a lot of the young guys today
[02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:15.070]  don't necessarily have that
[02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:18.390]  in the spirit of what they're doing
[02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:21.310]  and in the intention of what they're doing.
[02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:25.270]  But they're putting out a lot of cool stuff and that's fun.
[02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:27.950]  I generally worry just a little bit that
[02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:30.510]  some stuff is getting put out that probably shouldn't.
[02:00:30.510 --> 02:00:32.750]  Some of these genetics should be dead ends
[02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:35.510]  because the people that are putting out the seeds
[02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:39.670]  aren't testing or maybe they're breeding inferior stuff
[02:00:39.670 --> 02:00:41.870]  or not working lines so much.
[02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:43.190]  I was always taught you gotta work lines.
[02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:45.630]  You can do F1s and play with different things,
[02:00:45.630 --> 02:00:49.230]  but work lines and try to isolate things
[02:00:49.230 --> 02:00:51.990]  and advance the plant and not just advance yourself.
[02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.830]  And that's just, again,
[02:00:52.830 --> 02:00:55.310]  that's something that a mentor will teach you.
[02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:57.270]  Whereas if you're just picking up the hustle,
[02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:58.230]  that's something different.
[02:00:58.230 --> 02:01:02.590]  So when I got into it,
[02:01:03.710 --> 02:01:06.310]  there was a guy named Alien that had come out
[02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:07.310]  and he documented everything.
[02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:09.230]  And I took the page out of his playbook
[02:01:09.230 --> 02:01:10.790]  and I documented everything.
[02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:14.150]  I took all my plants out of my first test garden
[02:01:14.150 --> 02:01:15.590]  and took pictures of them at every week
[02:01:15.590 --> 02:01:18.030]  and showed everybody what I had and what it was doing.
[02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:20.270]  And when you bought from me, you knew what it was
[02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:22.550]  because I showed you everything along the way.
[02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:24.230]  And I think that that's really foreign
[02:01:24.230 --> 02:01:25.590]  to most people nowadays.
[02:01:25.590 --> 02:01:28.430]  And I don't know.
[02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:30.190]  It's cool that so many people are picking up
[02:01:30.190 --> 02:01:32.230]  and buying seeds and getting into it.
[02:01:32.230 --> 02:01:34.270]  I think that the folks that are buying seeds too
[02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:35.270]  need a little education.
[02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:37.790]  Listen, if you're buying seeds, folks,
[02:01:37.790 --> 02:01:38.630]  know what you're buying.
[02:01:38.630 --> 02:01:39.590]  Know what you're buying them for.
[02:01:39.590 --> 02:01:43.070]  Don't buy auto flowers to grow inside.
[02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:44.710]  That's silly, going for outside.
[02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:49.190]  Feminized seeds have a place.
[02:01:49.190 --> 02:01:50.910]  Regular seeds have a place.
[02:01:50.910 --> 02:01:52.590]  BXs are more for breeding.
[02:01:53.710 --> 02:01:56.470]  When you're talking filial generations,
[02:01:56.470 --> 02:01:58.590]  you gotta ask, is the breeder opening up the line
[02:01:58.590 --> 02:02:00.750]  or is he closing the line down?
[02:02:00.750 --> 02:02:02.590]  Are you gonna get more uniform stuff?
[02:02:02.590 --> 02:02:03.670]  Are you gonna get F2s?
[02:02:03.670 --> 02:02:05.870]  You're gonna get a wider variety.
[02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:08.430]  And I think that people generally are buying stuff
[02:02:08.430 --> 02:02:11.630]  and not quite knowing what even F2 means
[02:02:11.630 --> 02:02:13.750]  or what F3 means, but thinking that,
[02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:15.670]  oh, the higher the F, the better.
[02:02:15.670 --> 02:02:18.150]  And it really, it's-
[02:02:18.150 --> 02:02:22.790]  Even F1, honestly, I don't know.
[02:02:24.350 --> 02:02:27.550]  I've been looking through some large batches of stuff
[02:02:27.550 --> 02:02:30.590]  and it's really helped me classify
[02:02:30.590 --> 02:02:33.150]  the percentages of features you see
[02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:37.710]  in a spectrum of seeds.
[02:02:37.710 --> 02:02:40.030]  And the one I'm really stoked on right now
[02:02:40.030 --> 02:02:44.870]  is these GG4XMAX made by Lorax.
[02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:47.150]  I went through about 200 of them.
[02:02:47.150 --> 02:02:50.990]  So 100 females approximately I just went through today
[02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:52.670]  and sniffed them down.
[02:02:52.670 --> 02:02:59.330]  And I'm losing track of my thought.
[02:02:59.330 --> 02:03:01.290]  It was fucking wild.
[02:03:01.290 --> 02:03:03.610]  I was just very clear in this set
[02:03:03.610 --> 02:03:07.250]  because they were two distinct genetic things
[02:03:07.250 --> 02:03:09.450]  that also, if you broke them down to flavor,
[02:03:10.090 --> 02:03:10.930]  they're actually pretty similar
[02:03:10.930 --> 02:03:12.650]  when you talk about the matte cut
[02:03:12.650 --> 02:03:14.050]  that you put out in the Gorilla Glue,
[02:03:14.050 --> 02:03:15.250]  they're not too far.
[02:03:15.250 --> 02:03:17.130]  The Gorilla's a little more pungent,
[02:03:17.130 --> 02:03:18.970]  but they're pretty creamy and soft
[02:03:18.970 --> 02:03:23.170]  and not loud like a fruit or a gas, intense.
[02:03:23.170 --> 02:03:26.290]  They're kind of like these, you know what I'm saying?
[02:03:26.290 --> 02:03:27.930]  Anyway, so the cross of them,
[02:03:29.410 --> 02:03:31.810]  it was just very easy to classify this shit.
[02:03:31.810 --> 02:03:34.050]  And I'm sorry, I lost track of really where I was going.
[02:03:34.050 --> 02:03:37.010]  No, that's important because in your F1s,
[02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:38.010]  if you're breeding through F1s,
[02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:38.850]  you're gonna have like-
[02:03:39.290 --> 02:03:41.010]  Yeah, let me close.
[02:03:41.010 --> 02:03:44.210]  I just remember my point is if you open a pack of 10 seeds
[02:03:44.210 --> 02:03:46.010]  or a pack of 20 seeds,
[02:03:46.010 --> 02:03:49.250]  you don't see what I got to see in a pack of 200.
[02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:50.490]  You know what I mean?
[02:03:50.490 --> 02:03:52.330]  Because in this particular thing,
[02:03:52.330 --> 02:03:55.490]  I saw the Columbia side of the matte,
[02:03:55.490 --> 02:03:57.890]  which was the haze that I don't care for.
[02:03:57.890 --> 02:03:59.930]  A lot of people do, like you do.
[02:03:59.930 --> 02:04:00.770]  I heard you guys talking about it,
[02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:03.610]  but I don't particularly care for haze flavors.
[02:04:03.610 --> 02:04:06.370]  So that's like, I wanted to move away from that.
[02:04:06.370 --> 02:04:07.610]  And so I saw that,
[02:04:08.370 --> 02:04:10.330]  and the way I laid it out in the garden,
[02:04:10.330 --> 02:04:11.770]  this is what really blew my mind.
[02:04:11.770 --> 02:04:13.850]  The way I laid it out in the garden,
[02:04:13.850 --> 02:04:16.810]  it was almost like it went the Gorilla Glue,
[02:04:16.810 --> 02:04:18.210]  the creamy side of the matte,
[02:04:18.210 --> 02:04:19.490]  and then it went into the haze.
[02:04:19.490 --> 02:04:20.810]  And I'm like, what the fuck, dude?
[02:04:20.810 --> 02:04:22.370]  I'm opening 200 seeds.
[02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:24.650]  Like this is total randomness.
[02:04:24.650 --> 02:04:28.890]  But if I had bought two packs of seeds or one pack of seeds,
[02:04:28.890 --> 02:04:31.570]  I might've just seen a lot of the haze.
[02:04:31.570 --> 02:04:32.410]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:04:32.410 --> 02:04:36.850]  Like it's not a great representation of a F1, a true F1.
[02:04:36.850 --> 02:04:37.690]  And that's what this was,
[02:04:37.690 --> 02:04:42.130]  a true, like two distinct cultivars being crossed.
[02:04:42.130 --> 02:04:44.010]  And I saw a really good representation of it
[02:04:44.010 --> 02:04:45.530]  versus all the other stuff that I see
[02:04:45.530 --> 02:04:49.250]  that isn't as much of a distinct cultivars being crossed.
[02:04:49.250 --> 02:04:51.290]  They're more polyhybrids.
[02:04:51.290 --> 02:04:53.210]  Yeah, that was my muggled point.
[02:04:53.210 --> 02:04:55.330]  I'm sorry for not being as clear.
[02:04:55.330 --> 02:04:56.170]  That's a good point.
[02:04:56.170 --> 02:05:00.130]  And again, what are you going to do with that deal?
[02:05:00.130 --> 02:05:01.610]  I mean, if you're running a big field
[02:05:01.610 --> 02:05:03.050]  and you want uniformity,
[02:05:03.050 --> 02:05:05.410]  you want like an F generation
[02:05:05.410 --> 02:05:07.930]  that's been bred down and made uniform.
[02:05:07.930 --> 02:05:11.410]  If you're just looking to find an elite or a clone
[02:05:11.410 --> 02:05:12.410]  and take that one,
[02:05:12.410 --> 02:05:14.410]  okay, I found a nice keeper and I'm going to clone it.
[02:05:14.410 --> 02:05:15.650]  F1s are great for that.
[02:05:15.650 --> 02:05:17.410]  F2s are great for that.
[02:05:17.410 --> 02:05:21.290]  But don't go and try to plant a big grow up full of F2s
[02:05:21.290 --> 02:05:23.010]  and expect that there's going to be uniformity
[02:05:23.010 --> 02:05:25.130]  because there's going to be a massive variety.
[02:05:25.130 --> 02:05:27.210]  I'm just saying, know what you're getting into.
[02:05:27.210 --> 02:05:28.210]  Right, right.
[02:05:28.210 --> 02:05:30.890]  And yeah, with F1s, if you're breeding F1,
[02:05:30.890 --> 02:05:32.450]  just go look at the chart there, right?
[02:05:32.450 --> 02:05:34.530]  You get so many are like mom, so many are like dad,
[02:05:34.530 --> 02:05:35.570]  so many are down the middle
[02:05:35.570 --> 02:05:37.930]  and then they're going to have a slight variation of those.
[02:05:37.930 --> 02:05:39.930]  So, just kind of do a little research
[02:05:39.930 --> 02:05:43.250]  if you're popping seeds to know what you're getting into
[02:05:43.250 --> 02:05:45.610]  and have an idea of what you're seeking.
[02:05:45.610 --> 02:05:48.050]  Are you seeking a mom to clone?
[02:05:48.050 --> 02:05:51.250]  Are you seeking to get some uniformity?
[02:05:51.250 --> 02:05:53.330]  Do you want a wide variety of stuff?
[02:05:53.330 --> 02:05:54.770]  Are you looking for something to breed?
[02:05:54.770 --> 02:05:57.530]  Are you selecting for males or females?
[02:05:57.530 --> 02:05:59.570]  Everybody's doing something different with your seeds.
[02:05:59.570 --> 02:06:01.170]  That's kind of my point is just,
[02:06:01.570 --> 02:06:04.290]  you know, don't base your decision based off of hype
[02:06:04.290 --> 02:06:05.570]  or name or whatever else.
[02:06:05.570 --> 02:06:07.250]  It's, you know, know what you're getting into
[02:06:07.250 --> 02:06:09.650]  and also know your breeder, know how they're doing it.
[02:06:09.650 --> 02:06:11.170]  You know, with the regenerative guys,
[02:06:11.170 --> 02:06:15.050]  you know, we're trying to breed that plant intelligence
[02:06:15.050 --> 02:06:17.050]  using, you know, the mycelium
[02:06:17.050 --> 02:06:20.170]  and the whole living component to it.
[02:06:20.170 --> 02:06:21.930]  You know, whereas if people are breeding indoor
[02:06:21.930 --> 02:06:24.210]  and doing, you know, different stuff,
[02:06:24.210 --> 02:06:27.210]  that really doesn't matter to them, you know.
[02:06:27.210 --> 02:06:29.770]  I think we kind of did a disservice to ourselves
[02:06:29.770 --> 02:06:33.810]  as a community getting to this point
[02:06:33.810 --> 02:06:35.650]  in the evolution of the game here,
[02:06:35.650 --> 02:06:39.050]  where we, at the same time legalization came in
[02:06:39.050 --> 02:06:41.170]  and we're able to run these larger numbers
[02:06:41.170 --> 02:06:44.610]  and do this, the regenerative stuff in particular.
[02:06:46.370 --> 02:06:49.130]  At the same time, we also fell away from the forums.
[02:06:49.130 --> 02:06:54.130]  And I feel like the forums was a better long format.
[02:06:54.650 --> 02:06:58.090]  It was a better chance to showcase that week by week,
[02:06:58.130 --> 02:06:59.850]  plant by plant, like you were talking about
[02:06:59.850 --> 02:07:00.810]  a few minutes ago, Kaya.
[02:07:00.810 --> 02:07:05.650]  And now we've evolved into this pseudo community
[02:07:05.650 --> 02:07:08.690]  of I'm only gonna show the best.
[02:07:08.690 --> 02:07:09.570]  I'm speaking very general.
[02:07:09.570 --> 02:07:14.170]  I'm not talking about anybody here, but as a community,
[02:07:14.170 --> 02:07:15.010]  it just feels-
[02:07:15.010 --> 02:07:17.130]  Josh showed his bud raft the other day.
[02:07:17.130 --> 02:07:18.610]  Yeah, but as a community,
[02:07:18.610 --> 02:07:21.370]  it just feels like we've got to, you know,
[02:07:21.370 --> 02:07:23.730]  we only show our best, we hide our mistakes.
[02:07:23.730 --> 02:07:26.370]  We don't really lay it out there for anybody anymore.
[02:07:26.410 --> 02:07:29.810]  And we don't learn as a community anymore.
[02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:31.210]  We might be learning individually,
[02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:33.090]  but then we're all learning the same things
[02:07:33.090 --> 02:07:35.890]  at different times and we're not building anything.
[02:07:35.890 --> 02:07:39.010]  And it just feels like we're doing a disservice to ourselves
[02:07:39.010 --> 02:07:41.450]  as a community, as a whole,
[02:07:41.450 --> 02:07:43.850]  that we've changed formats at the same time
[02:07:43.850 --> 02:07:45.970]  that the games changed.
[02:07:45.970 --> 02:07:48.730]  Like the game went one way and we went the other.
[02:07:48.730 --> 02:07:51.330]  I really, I think Instagram and stuff
[02:07:51.330 --> 02:07:53.810]  has been a great platform and it's really dope,
[02:07:53.810 --> 02:07:55.850]  even with all the harassment and deleting the shit
[02:07:56.370 --> 02:07:57.210]  and whatever.
[02:07:57.210 --> 02:08:00.010]  I really liked the forums and I totally agree with you,
[02:08:00.010 --> 02:08:02.250]  but I can tell you from personal experience,
[02:08:02.250 --> 02:08:05.930]  I've built huge content on at least three forums.
[02:08:07.730 --> 02:08:10.370]  All that stuff that I did before
[02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:12.850]  that I was just talking about on my first crops,
[02:08:12.850 --> 02:08:14.130]  that's gone.
[02:08:14.130 --> 02:08:15.410]  That website is gone.
[02:08:15.410 --> 02:08:18.770]  Those guys shut it down, ghosted.
[02:08:18.770 --> 02:08:20.570]  I mean, I would have paid for the material.
[02:08:20.570 --> 02:08:21.890]  I would have paid for all that content.
[02:08:21.890 --> 02:08:23.530]  Which forum was that?
[02:08:23.530 --> 02:08:27.690]  It was called Northwest Green Thumb, nwgt.org.
[02:08:27.690 --> 02:08:30.770]  And it was up here in Washington State.
[02:08:30.770 --> 02:08:32.050]  And I can't tell you how many people
[02:08:32.050 --> 02:08:33.610]  that were on that site now are out there
[02:08:33.610 --> 02:08:36.850]  doing huge things in the cannabis world, huge things.
[02:08:36.850 --> 02:08:38.570]  And it was just a bunch of dudes.
[02:08:39.610 --> 02:08:42.530]  We raised big money to fight the legalization thing
[02:08:42.530 --> 02:08:44.690]  in Washington because we knew it was a sham
[02:08:44.690 --> 02:08:47.450]  and they were gonna shaft the medical patients.
[02:08:47.450 --> 02:08:50.050]  We were doing a lot of great things off that platform.
[02:08:50.050 --> 02:08:51.770]  And again, we built huge content.
[02:08:51.770 --> 02:08:54.650]  I built content on THC Farm.
[02:08:54.650 --> 02:08:56.490]  I built content on Firestacks.
[02:08:56.490 --> 02:08:58.890]  I built content on all these places.
[02:08:58.890 --> 02:09:01.730]  The C Depot, shut down, shut down, shut down.
[02:09:01.730 --> 02:09:03.410]  And you just lose all that.
[02:09:03.410 --> 02:09:07.290]  So for me, I was just tired of doing it.
[02:09:07.290 --> 02:09:08.610]  When Instagram shut me down, I was like,
[02:09:08.610 --> 02:09:10.970]  fuck, are you serious again?
[02:09:10.970 --> 02:09:13.210]  So I think the really, the answer is like,
[02:09:14.850 --> 02:09:16.130]  shout out to Capulator, right?
[02:09:16.130 --> 02:09:18.050]  Because he built his own little thing.
[02:09:18.570 --> 02:09:20.090]  Was satisfied.
[02:09:20.090 --> 02:09:20.930]  I was hoping to do that.
[02:09:20.930 --> 02:09:22.410]  And I'm like, yeah, maybe, I don't know.
[02:09:22.410 --> 02:09:23.410]  I'm not techie like that.
[02:09:23.410 --> 02:09:24.810]  But I think that's the way to do it.
[02:09:24.810 --> 02:09:27.850]  You set up private stuff and I don't know.
[02:09:27.850 --> 02:09:28.850]  Or a legend.
[02:09:28.850 --> 02:09:31.650]  And that's what I was just gonna say like this.
[02:09:31.650 --> 02:09:34.450]  Peter, you've really hit the nail on the head
[02:09:34.450 --> 02:09:36.170]  for the COVID timing
[02:09:36.170 --> 02:09:39.270]  and what we're all going through as a community.
[02:09:40.170 --> 02:09:42.170]  Just your ability to be able to host
[02:09:42.170 --> 02:09:43.850]  these continual conversations.
[02:09:43.850 --> 02:09:46.530]  Like I'm on a handful of them,
[02:09:46.530 --> 02:09:48.330]  but I'm also listening to them all.
[02:09:48.330 --> 02:09:49.490]  And I know what we all are
[02:09:49.490 --> 02:09:51.370]  and we're learning from each other.
[02:09:51.370 --> 02:09:53.370]  And we may lose this platform.
[02:09:53.370 --> 02:09:54.210]  You're right, Kaya.
[02:09:54.210 --> 02:09:56.530]  Like this could all disappear at some point
[02:09:56.530 --> 02:09:59.050]  and YouTube could say, fuck this whole platform.
[02:09:59.050 --> 02:10:01.250]  But we've all-
[02:10:01.250 --> 02:10:02.490]  I think about that.
[02:10:02.490 --> 02:10:03.570]  Cause I'm like,
[02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:07.370]  even like I wanna do a lot of music stuff
[02:10:07.370 --> 02:10:09.970]  and I'm like, the weed stuff hasn't,
[02:10:09.970 --> 02:10:13.290]  like I haven't been flagged because of the weed stuff yet.
[02:10:13.290 --> 02:10:15.730]  But then I'm like, if I do music
[02:10:15.730 --> 02:10:17.850]  and some DJ is playing copyright music,
[02:10:17.850 --> 02:10:20.290]  will that bring like the whole thing crashing down?
[02:10:20.290 --> 02:10:21.570]  And I like stress out over it.
[02:10:21.570 --> 02:10:23.210]  But I'm like, but it'd be fucking awesome
[02:10:23.210 --> 02:10:27.370]  to have like DJs playing on Monday night.
[02:10:27.370 --> 02:10:30.970]  Like imagine if tonight after we wrap up,
[02:10:30.970 --> 02:10:32.090]  it's like, all right,
[02:10:32.090 --> 02:10:36.610]  like this DJ is coming on for the next two hours.
[02:10:36.610 --> 02:10:39.130]  DJ Donald Glodge shutting down the house.
[02:10:39.250 --> 02:10:40.330]  I don't know.
[02:10:43.370 --> 02:10:46.570]  My point was that like the information is communicated
[02:10:46.570 --> 02:10:51.570]  and like how many people are listening live heard that.
[02:10:51.570 --> 02:10:53.770]  And they like, I have people that DM me
[02:10:53.770 --> 02:10:56.730]  about conversations that like somebody had,
[02:10:56.730 --> 02:11:00.730]  like Jackson had four years ago on some random ass thing.
[02:11:00.730 --> 02:11:02.250]  And they're like, oh, did you check this out?
[02:11:02.250 --> 02:11:03.330]  And I'm like, oh shit, dude.
[02:11:03.330 --> 02:11:05.370]  Like the people are listening
[02:11:05.370 --> 02:11:07.050]  and that shit moves through, you know?
[02:11:07.210 --> 02:11:09.370]  And so you just, I don't know,
[02:11:09.370 --> 02:11:13.450]  shout out to everyone that gives to any platform, you know?
[02:11:14.490 --> 02:11:15.330]  That's true.
[02:11:15.330 --> 02:11:16.530]  You can't stop putting it out there.
[02:11:16.530 --> 02:11:17.370]  I mean, you know.
[02:11:18.930 --> 02:11:22.370]  So because I'm gonna forget the question,
[02:11:22.370 --> 02:11:25.330]  you mentioned Capulator and I feel like he's,
[02:11:27.210 --> 02:11:29.370]  like he's, am I correct in assuming
[02:11:29.370 --> 02:11:30.890]  that he's just minting money?
[02:11:30.890 --> 02:11:33.850]  Like he's like a rock star of,
[02:11:33.850 --> 02:11:36.650]  I mean, like you go to the Emerald Cup
[02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:42.050]  and there's like the line like out of that,
[02:11:42.050 --> 02:11:47.050]  whatever air hanger and like winding around to buy his seeds
[02:11:48.250 --> 02:11:53.570]  and like, can you talk about like,
[02:11:53.570 --> 02:11:56.650]  who's making the most money as a breeder?
[02:11:56.650 --> 02:11:59.210]  And then like, what are the different channels?
[02:11:59.210 --> 02:12:00.850]  Like, cause you work with seed banks.
[02:12:00.850 --> 02:12:02.490]  Do you also sell, like what's the balance
[02:12:02.490 --> 02:12:06.450]  between selling directly, selling through seed banks?
[02:12:06.450 --> 02:12:07.930]  Like who do you rely on?
[02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:10.850]  I'm not saying anything about any of that.
[02:12:11.730 --> 02:12:13.330]  No way, I'm not dry snitching.
[02:12:13.330 --> 02:12:15.090]  You can't get me to do that, Peter.
[02:12:16.170 --> 02:12:17.770]  I'll say this though.
[02:12:17.770 --> 02:12:19.690]  Yeah, Capulator kills it.
[02:12:19.690 --> 02:12:24.690]  And you know, the last year that I went to the Emerald Cup,
[02:12:25.370 --> 02:12:26.810]  I had a booth next to Bodhi
[02:12:26.810 --> 02:12:30.010]  and Capulator had a big line outside
[02:12:30.010 --> 02:12:31.770]  working out of Neptune's booth,
[02:12:31.770 --> 02:12:36.730]  but Bodhi had a monster line as well.
[02:12:36.730 --> 02:12:39.570]  And the year before that, it was Dying Breed Seeds
[02:12:39.570 --> 02:12:44.570]  and Galbi, I think it was Dragon Flame or some,
[02:12:45.130 --> 02:12:47.530]  you know, different stuff comes up, you know?
[02:12:47.530 --> 02:12:49.850]  And it's really cool because people get,
[02:12:49.850 --> 02:12:53.210]  they get tapped into different veins of different genetics
[02:12:53.210 --> 02:12:55.410]  that are striking chords with people.
[02:12:55.410 --> 02:12:57.930]  And, you know, I mean, there's some marketing to it
[02:12:57.930 --> 02:13:00.250]  and that's okay, you know,
[02:13:00.250 --> 02:13:02.770]  because it takes a little bit of marketing
[02:13:02.770 --> 02:13:04.850]  and a little hype to get it out there,
[02:13:04.850 --> 02:13:07.290]  but it's only gonna catch if it's real.
[02:13:07.290 --> 02:13:09.730]  And when you can back up that marketing
[02:13:09.730 --> 02:13:12.530]  with something that catches, you win.
[02:13:12.530 --> 02:13:16.730]  And big ups to those guys who are able to do that and win.
[02:13:16.730 --> 02:13:17.570]  You know, that's-
[02:13:17.570 --> 02:13:19.890]  Did you ever play any music or do any bands, Kaya?
[02:13:19.890 --> 02:13:22.770]  Because it's a lot like what we were just talking about,
[02:13:22.770 --> 02:13:25.850]  playing music and putting music out
[02:13:25.850 --> 02:13:28.250]  and producing, you know, an album
[02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:31.570]  where you can strike a chord and maybe have a moment.
[02:13:31.570 --> 02:13:33.170]  And then you keep putting albums out,
[02:13:34.170 --> 02:13:35.850]  and people keep appreciating that,
[02:13:35.850 --> 02:13:38.570]  but maybe you had this one moment, this one album,
[02:13:38.570 --> 02:13:42.690]  or this series of albums that was just fucking-
[02:13:42.690 --> 02:13:45.090]  You were a one cult of our wonder.
[02:13:45.090 --> 02:13:46.970]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[02:13:46.970 --> 02:13:48.210]  That's so funny.
[02:13:48.210 --> 02:13:50.570]  Yeah, no, you know, back in the day,
[02:13:50.570 --> 02:13:52.410]  I actually had a record label
[02:13:52.410 --> 02:13:55.050]  and I produced some of Donald Gwad's first,
[02:13:55.050 --> 02:13:57.330]  executive produced his first records.
[02:13:57.330 --> 02:13:59.570]  And we would go to Miami every year
[02:13:59.570 --> 02:14:01.650]  for the Winter Music Conference.
[02:14:01.690 --> 02:14:04.330]  And, you know, some of the biggest DJs in the world
[02:14:04.330 --> 02:14:06.010]  were spinning our white label records.
[02:14:06.010 --> 02:14:08.250]  And yeah, it was cool.
[02:14:08.250 --> 02:14:09.490]  That's cool shit.
[02:14:09.490 --> 02:14:11.330]  You know, I think I'm, I think I'm,
[02:14:12.330 --> 02:14:15.930]  I don't know, I'm in a different lane, obviously,
[02:14:15.930 --> 02:14:17.450]  but, you know, I think I do all right
[02:14:17.450 --> 02:14:18.730]  with my marketing and stuff.
[02:14:18.730 --> 02:14:22.010]  And, you know, a lot of thought went into our brand
[02:14:22.010 --> 02:14:26.730]  and our strain names and identifying with where we're at
[02:14:26.730 --> 02:14:28.690]  and, you know, having it tie into everything.
[02:14:28.690 --> 02:14:31.090]  And I think that's part of doing something right,
[02:14:31.090 --> 02:14:34.210]  you know, and you have to be able to do that
[02:14:34.210 --> 02:14:36.250]  or you're not gonna make it in this market.
[02:14:36.250 --> 02:14:40.370]  It's pretty competitive these days.
[02:14:40.370 --> 02:14:41.410]  And it's cool.
[02:14:41.410 --> 02:14:42.650]  It's exciting.
[02:14:42.650 --> 02:14:46.010]  But then like dealing with,
[02:14:46.010 --> 02:14:50.530]  what's kind of the typical breeder seed bank relationship?
[02:14:52.690 --> 02:14:54.530]  You know, I don't know, I guess back in the day
[02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:55.370]  when you were starting out,
[02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:56.690]  you just would send your seeds.
[02:14:56.690 --> 02:14:57.930]  You hope somebody would carry them
[02:14:57.930 --> 02:15:01.010]  and you send your seeds and they would put them up
[02:15:01.930 --> 02:15:03.050]  and if you did a good job marketing it,
[02:15:03.050 --> 02:15:05.410]  people would buy them and they would order more.
[02:15:05.410 --> 02:15:07.170]  But you kind of had to market it for yourself.
[02:15:07.170 --> 02:15:09.770]  And these days, I think the seed companies,
[02:15:09.770 --> 02:15:11.090]  some of them are doing a better job
[02:15:11.090 --> 02:15:12.450]  at marketing and pushing stuff.
[02:15:12.450 --> 02:15:13.810]  Other ones are pretty lazy.
[02:15:14.970 --> 02:15:16.370]  But I think for the most part, you know,
[02:15:16.370 --> 02:15:18.050]  they do a pretty good job of promoting
[02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:19.170]  the people that they carry
[02:15:19.170 --> 02:15:21.490]  and explaining why they carry different, you know,
[02:15:21.490 --> 02:15:23.490]  different banks carry different people
[02:15:23.490 --> 02:15:25.770]  for, you know, different reasons.
[02:15:26.850 --> 02:15:27.770]  And I think they do a good job
[02:15:27.770 --> 02:15:29.170]  of putting their products out there.
[02:15:29.170 --> 02:15:31.490]  But, you know, once you get more developed
[02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:34.370]  than the companies, I think we'll buy them from you.
[02:15:34.370 --> 02:15:35.490]  But in the beginning, you know,
[02:15:35.490 --> 02:15:37.490]  it's like you're on front street
[02:15:37.490 --> 02:15:40.010]  and then you start getting paid.
[02:15:40.010 --> 02:15:43.010]  And, you know, I've got good relationships
[02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:44.330]  with some seed banks
[02:15:44.330 --> 02:15:46.330]  and I've had these relationships for a long time.
[02:15:46.330 --> 02:15:50.490]  And initially I sold all my seeds myself
[02:15:50.490 --> 02:15:52.170]  and it just, it's a lot to manage.
[02:15:52.170 --> 02:15:53.170]  You know, there's some guys out there
[02:15:53.170 --> 02:15:54.530]  hustling independently and doing it.
[02:15:54.530 --> 02:15:56.650]  And, you know.
[02:15:56.650 --> 02:15:58.530]  Well, that's why I like Capulator.
[02:15:58.530 --> 02:16:01.290]  Like, is he carried through seed banks
[02:16:01.290 --> 02:16:02.570]  or is he just like, fuck it.
[02:16:02.570 --> 02:16:05.090]  I don't need to split revenue with anyone.
[02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:06.530]  You know, I don't, I don't,
[02:16:06.530 --> 02:16:08.810]  I think Capulator goes through a couple seed banks.
[02:16:08.810 --> 02:16:11.250]  I think it's, you know, there may be just a handful.
[02:16:11.250 --> 02:16:14.050]  You know, I only go through a handful of seed banks myself.
[02:16:14.050 --> 02:16:14.890]  But he does.
[02:16:14.890 --> 02:16:17.890]  And does each seed bank have kind of like
[02:16:17.890 --> 02:16:19.970]  geographic kind of reach?
[02:16:19.970 --> 02:16:22.610]  Like, oh, I'm going to work with these guys to hit Europe,
[02:16:22.610 --> 02:16:24.690]  these guys to hit North America.
[02:16:24.690 --> 02:16:26.330]  No, I think most of them are working
[02:16:27.010 --> 02:16:28.330]  on a worldwide scale.
[02:16:28.330 --> 02:16:31.450]  But, you know, if you're the seed bank from such an area,
[02:16:31.450 --> 02:16:32.650]  maybe those people are loyal.
[02:16:32.650 --> 02:16:34.370]  You know, if your seed bank is based out of Cali,
[02:16:34.370 --> 02:16:37.530]  maybe your California customers are loyal to you.
[02:16:37.530 --> 02:16:40.410]  But I think that their reach is generally far and wide.
[02:16:41.970 --> 02:16:45.450]  I think some of that has to do with like social circles.
[02:16:45.450 --> 02:16:48.610]  Certain social circles will gravitate
[02:16:48.610 --> 02:16:50.130]  towards certain seed banks,
[02:16:51.450 --> 02:16:53.450]  just based on word of mouth and trust
[02:16:53.450 --> 02:16:55.770]  and, you know, past relationships.
[02:16:56.450 --> 02:16:57.290]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:16:57.290 --> 02:16:58.970]  And I think trust is a huge,
[02:16:58.970 --> 02:17:02.850]  listen, seed buyers are, I love you guys.
[02:17:02.850 --> 02:17:03.690]  Thank you.
[02:17:04.930 --> 02:17:07.810]  I'm not going to say anything negative about you.
[02:17:07.810 --> 02:17:09.050]  They can be very finicky.
[02:17:09.050 --> 02:17:11.450]  Like, you know, we put our order in,
[02:17:11.450 --> 02:17:13.130]  where's our seed the next day?
[02:17:13.130 --> 02:17:14.850]  You know, they want that.
[02:17:14.850 --> 02:17:15.970]  They want to turn around.
[02:17:15.970 --> 02:17:17.970]  They want to be, you know, they don't like,
[02:17:17.970 --> 02:17:19.570]  and as somebody like me,
[02:17:19.570 --> 02:17:22.210]  like I'm a farmer and a hash maker.
[02:17:22.210 --> 02:17:25.210]  So I'm out there in the field and I'm working hard
[02:17:25.650 --> 02:17:26.930]  and I got babies when I come home.
[02:17:26.930 --> 02:17:28.970]  So I don't have a lot of time to deal with all that.
[02:17:28.970 --> 02:17:31.250]  So in the beginning I did it.
[02:17:31.250 --> 02:17:34.210]  And as I got to the point where I'm at now,
[02:17:34.210 --> 02:17:36.170]  if I can push that off to somebody else
[02:17:36.170 --> 02:17:37.290]  and they can make some money too,
[02:17:37.290 --> 02:17:39.210]  and that's totally okay.
[02:17:39.210 --> 02:17:40.050]  You know what I mean?
[02:17:40.050 --> 02:17:42.770]  And that's where I started adopting letting seed banks
[02:17:43.970 --> 02:17:47.170]  take, you know, the majority of my workload
[02:17:47.170 --> 02:17:48.610]  and push it around.
[02:17:48.610 --> 02:17:51.170]  And, you know, I did the cycle of the circuit.
[02:17:51.170 --> 02:17:54.090]  I went to all the high times cups and chalice cups
[02:17:54.090 --> 02:17:54.930]  and did all that.
[02:17:55.650 --> 02:17:57.650]  And I got the big booth and man, those events are really fun.
[02:17:57.650 --> 02:18:01.170]  I got some cool videos and it was tiring.
[02:18:02.290 --> 02:18:03.890]  You know, I'd rather be at home.
[02:18:03.890 --> 02:18:06.490]  I'm, you know, I'm an old Rasta guy.
[02:18:06.490 --> 02:18:08.730]  I want to be at home with my kids
[02:18:08.730 --> 02:18:10.610]  and I want to be on the farm with my animals.
[02:18:10.610 --> 02:18:13.210]  And I, you know, the vibes there were just too big,
[02:18:13.210 --> 02:18:15.770]  too many people buzzing around and too much energy.
[02:18:15.770 --> 02:18:18.730]  And it just, it just wasn't my thing, you know?
[02:18:18.730 --> 02:18:21.970]  So I went to those events for one year,
[02:18:21.970 --> 02:18:23.970]  like I hit them all and it was great.
[02:18:24.010 --> 02:18:25.650]  It was great to meet people and shake their hands.
[02:18:25.650 --> 02:18:28.010]  And I'm really a lot more selective.
[02:18:28.010 --> 02:18:29.610]  I'll go to regenerative farming events
[02:18:29.610 --> 02:18:32.490]  and speak on that kind of stuff now.
[02:18:32.490 --> 02:18:36.690]  And that's like a crowd that kind of is my speed.
[02:18:36.690 --> 02:18:38.850]  And I enjoy that.
[02:18:38.850 --> 02:18:41.890]  And it gives me energy back and doesn't drain me.
[02:18:41.890 --> 02:18:43.570]  So, you know, I don't do some of those events,
[02:18:43.570 --> 02:18:45.050]  but these ones I do, you know.
[02:18:46.610 --> 02:18:48.570]  I don't know what Capulet's situation is, you know.
[02:18:48.570 --> 02:18:50.010]  Other people can take that kind of stuff.
[02:18:50.010 --> 02:18:51.730]  I just, it's not, I'm not built for that.
[02:18:51.730 --> 02:18:53.650]  I do other things, you know.
[02:18:54.330 --> 02:18:58.970]  With kind of online sales directly or through seed banks,
[02:18:58.970 --> 02:19:01.650]  have you noticed any weird, like,
[02:19:01.650 --> 02:19:05.370]  like I'm huge in Latvia, like a band that, you know,
[02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:08.410]  because I view it kind of like bands where it's like,
[02:19:08.410 --> 02:19:10.810]  like I have friends who had a band
[02:19:10.810 --> 02:19:14.930]  and they were huge in Japan
[02:19:14.930 --> 02:19:19.930]  and they would go like tour in Japan and make mint
[02:19:19.970 --> 02:19:24.970]  because just the Japanese music scene love their shit.
[02:19:27.410 --> 02:19:29.610]  Yeah, it goes through waves.
[02:19:29.610 --> 02:19:30.570]  When I first came out,
[02:19:30.570 --> 02:19:33.250]  it was like a whole bunch of people in Australia
[02:19:33.250 --> 02:19:34.090]  and it was cool.
[02:19:34.090 --> 02:19:35.890]  And they would call me and say, can I get some seeds, mate?
[02:19:35.890 --> 02:19:38.090]  And I'm like, no, you can't buy any, but I'll trade you.
[02:19:38.090 --> 02:19:39.610]  Send me, send me a boomerang, you know.
[02:19:39.610 --> 02:19:40.650]  And they send me a boomerang
[02:19:40.650 --> 02:19:42.490]  and I got all kinds of cool stuff.
[02:19:42.490 --> 02:19:45.010]  Ship me a live kangaroo.
[02:19:45.010 --> 02:19:45.850]  Yeah.
[02:19:46.730 --> 02:19:50.330]  I want a koala bear and a kilo of eucalyptus leaf.
[02:19:52.090 --> 02:19:54.610]  But you know, and then there's people in Africa.
[02:19:54.610 --> 02:19:57.250]  It was really kind of strange when we went to Spain
[02:19:57.250 --> 02:20:02.250]  for Spanibus, I started getting calls from guys
[02:20:02.650 --> 02:20:04.770]  in the Ukraine and Russia.
[02:20:04.770 --> 02:20:06.130]  And I thought, damn, that's really weird.
[02:20:06.130 --> 02:20:07.650]  And that kind of sketched me out a little bit,
[02:20:07.650 --> 02:20:08.490]  to be honest.
[02:20:09.770 --> 02:20:11.210]  I called some of my friends, I'm like,
[02:20:11.210 --> 02:20:12.650]  do I deal with the Ukrainians?
[02:20:12.650 --> 02:20:14.210]  And they're like, don't deal with the Ukrainians.
[02:20:14.210 --> 02:20:15.690]  No offense, Ukrainians.
[02:20:16.530 --> 02:20:17.370]  Maybe you're okay, I don't know.
[02:20:17.370 --> 02:20:19.730]  But you know, it was just kind of weird, you know?
[02:20:19.730 --> 02:20:22.410]  So it goes around and it's kind of neat, you know,
[02:20:22.410 --> 02:20:26.010]  when you get people from Peru and Chile
[02:20:26.010 --> 02:20:29.290]  and all over the, you know, like you wouldn't imagine.
[02:20:29.290 --> 02:20:33.610]  I get emails from people from Iran or Afghanistan.
[02:20:33.610 --> 02:20:36.650]  I could get beheaded for growing your seeds,
[02:20:36.650 --> 02:20:38.410]  but I'm doing it anyway.
[02:20:38.410 --> 02:20:41.010]  You know, just like, hey, you know,
[02:20:41.010 --> 02:20:42.810]  and you could tell they're maybe a little younger,
[02:20:42.810 --> 02:20:45.050]  but they're like, hey, I love weed.
[02:20:46.650 --> 02:20:48.690]  What do, how can I grow seeds?
[02:20:48.690 --> 02:20:50.130]  You know, and sometimes they just want advice.
[02:20:50.130 --> 02:20:52.730]  Sometimes they want me to send them some seeds.
[02:20:52.730 --> 02:20:54.890]  You know, I'm hesitant to do that,
[02:20:54.890 --> 02:20:58.170]  but you know, I think it's really, really cool,
[02:20:58.170 --> 02:21:00.970]  you know, that this herb can connect people
[02:21:02.010 --> 02:21:07.010]  from here to Iran, to Australia, you know, everywhere.
[02:21:07.050 --> 02:21:08.690]  It's amazing, right?
[02:21:08.690 --> 02:21:11.210]  Like the healing of the nations.
[02:21:11.210 --> 02:21:13.130]  It's a sacrament, you know?
[02:21:14.490 --> 02:21:15.330]  Thanks.
[02:21:16.690 --> 02:21:18.730]  I'm looking through the-
[02:21:18.730 --> 02:21:23.730]  Brazil is pretty hot on weed.
[02:21:24.770 --> 02:21:26.530]  I get a lot of orders from Brazil.
[02:21:27.730 --> 02:21:31.210]  I'm gonna take this lull to take my bow out of here.
[02:21:31.210 --> 02:21:33.490]  I'm fading, guys, but I appreciate the conversation.
[02:21:33.490 --> 02:21:35.890]  It's been a blessing to hang out with y'all.
[02:21:35.890 --> 02:21:37.010]  And-
[02:21:37.010 --> 02:21:39.890]  We can probably wrap it up shortly too.
[02:21:39.890 --> 02:21:41.130]  It's, what is it?
[02:21:41.130 --> 02:21:44.730]  Eight, nine, 10, two and a half hours.
[02:21:45.410 --> 02:21:46.730]  Yeah, man.
[02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:47.970]  It's been a lot of fun, guys.
[02:21:47.970 --> 02:21:50.970]  I appreciate it every time you guys all get together
[02:21:50.970 --> 02:21:51.810]  with me, man.
[02:21:51.810 --> 02:21:52.650]  It's been a lot of fun.
[02:21:52.650 --> 02:21:54.770]  I'm gonna take myself to bed though
[02:21:54.770 --> 02:21:56.690]  and let y'all carry the torch.
[02:21:56.690 --> 02:21:57.850]  All right, and just quickly,
[02:21:57.850 --> 02:21:59.970]  where are people watching from?
[02:22:03.300 --> 02:22:05.900]  Let's wait to see if we have any South Africa
[02:22:05.900 --> 02:22:07.620]  and Australia in the house.
[02:22:08.780 --> 02:22:10.180]  You guys are always-
[02:22:19.660 --> 02:22:21.900]  Are any of you folks Josh Heinrich's fans?
[02:22:24.100 --> 02:22:26.700]  I'll tell you what, let's give away this Josh Heinrich's card.
[02:22:26.700 --> 02:22:29.140]  If you can tell me where Josh Heinrich's is from,
[02:22:30.020 --> 02:22:31.980]  you win this card and a pack of seeds.
[02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:36.700]  All right, people are saying where they're from right now.
[02:22:36.700 --> 02:22:40.420]  All right, where is, you gotta say Josh.
[02:22:40.420 --> 02:22:43.620]  Yeah, I feel Tennessee, Jesus, this is flying by.
[02:22:43.620 --> 02:22:44.620]  That's amazing.
[02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:51.300]  Ohio, Portland, Ohio, Cali, Oregon, Maine,
[02:22:51.340 --> 02:22:56.100]  Cali, NorCal, Whidbey Island, South Carolina, Florida,
[02:22:56.100 --> 02:22:59.380]  Santa, a lot of USA, Georgia, Tennessee, Jesus.
[02:22:59.380 --> 02:23:03.020]  Oh, Copenhagen, Asia, Buffalo, France in the house.
[02:23:03.020 --> 02:23:08.020]  Washington, all right, so, but Josh Heinrich, all right.
[02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:19.280]  Hawaii, Todd Tilth in Hawaii.
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:20.240]  Aloha.
[02:23:20.240 --> 02:23:21.320]  Blue's back.
[02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:27.960]  Yeah, for blue, for Tyler, it's 10 there, 11.
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:29.920]  1.30 in the morning, he's still in the studio.
[02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:32.960]  I don't know if his voice is very happy with that.
[02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:37.200]  We have Jibran Ali is in the Caribbean.
[02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:39.320]  Yeah, Jibran, Trinidad, nice.
[02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:44.320]  So Jibran, one of my best friends from college
[02:23:45.080 --> 02:23:50.080]  is from Trinidad and his dad makes the most amazing hot sauce
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:56.000]  from scotch bonnets and that shit is spicy.
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:58.880]  It is probably the spiciest hot sauce I've ever had.
[02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:04.880]  Hey, Mike Bauer, you win this rookie card, Josh Heinrichs.
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:08.800]  Shoot me an email, the nw47 at gmail.com
[02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:10.400]  and we're gonna get you this in a pack of seeds.
[02:24:10.400 --> 02:24:14.240]  Mike Bauer, you got the correct answer, thank you, sir.
[02:24:14.240 --> 02:24:15.080]  Hey, Cascades.
[02:24:15.080 --> 02:24:18.160]  Sorry, Springfield, Illinois or Mass?
[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:19.480]  Springfield, Missouri.
[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:22.720]  Fuck, that's why the Simpsons are from Springfield
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:24.240]  because isn't there like a Springfield
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:25.080]  in every single state?
[02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:27.520]  Simpsons, yes, yes, it's the Simpsons.
[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:29.520]  Isn't that why they pick Springfield?
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:31.680]  Because like, how about this?
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:35.880]  If anybody can say how many states have a Springfield,
[02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:38.400]  can they win something?
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:39.240]  That's a good one.
[02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:41.280]  Do you know the answer to that, though?
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:42.120]  What's that?
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:44.320]  There's a lot of states too, 50.
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:45.440]  No, I know.
[02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:47.800]  Is it 50, is it 37?
[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:50.280]  I actually have no, somebody could say
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:52.080]  and I would have no idea.
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:54.240]  So it's probably a bad one
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:56.360]  because then I'd have to research.
[02:24:56.360 --> 02:24:58.680]  I wanna give away some of these Kush creams.
[02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:01.720]  How can we give away some of these Kush creams?
[02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:06.720]  If someone can think of a like raffle question.
[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:08.600]  What are the Kush creams?
[02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:13.880]  Kush creams are topical creams made with all kinds
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:15.560]  of stuff from my girl, Megan.
[02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:17.600]  Okay, gotcha.
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:20.400]  I thought it was like, that was a straight name, seeds.
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:21.720]  Nope, nope.
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:22.560]  Cool.
[02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:26.390]  That's cool.
[02:25:26.390 --> 02:25:29.430]  Got right into it, it's 70 miles an hour.
[02:25:33.430 --> 02:25:36.070]  Someone's drunken high in Maine.
[02:25:39.310 --> 02:25:40.430]  Shaking his head.
[02:25:44.950 --> 02:25:46.750]  34 states your market's winning.
[02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:48.790]  Is that for Springfields?
[02:25:51.710 --> 02:25:52.550]  Wait, all right.
[02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:55.230]  So Kush cream, I assume that is THC light.
[02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:57.750]  So you can ship it across state lines.
[02:25:57.750 --> 02:25:58.590]  That's correct.
[02:25:58.590 --> 02:26:00.030]  These are CBD formulations.
[02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:00.870]  CBD.
[02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:01.710]  I got it, okay.
[02:26:01.710 --> 02:26:06.150]  So it's like light beer.
[02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:09.430]  Yeah, you can actually buy these on Amazon if you'd like.
[02:26:09.430 --> 02:26:13.070]  So, but yeah, these are.
[02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:16.590]  Wait, so what's the question to win those?
[02:26:17.430 --> 02:26:19.390]  Or have we not thought of a question yet?
[02:26:19.390 --> 02:26:21.390]  If you know the answer to the question you ask,
[02:26:21.390 --> 02:26:22.750]  we can do that one.
[02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:23.590]  No, I don't.
[02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:25.590]  That was why I was like, that's a bad question
[02:26:25.590 --> 02:26:26.870]  because I don't even know the answer.
[02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:30.310]  So unless one of us knows the answer,
[02:26:32.590 --> 02:26:34.950]  yeah, people are saying all different numbers.
[02:26:35.950 --> 02:26:36.790]  Let's do this one.
[02:26:36.790 --> 02:26:38.590]  What kind of dog do I have?
[02:26:38.590 --> 02:26:40.830]  Ooh, like breed?
[02:26:40.830 --> 02:26:43.270]  Yeah, what kind of, what breed of dog do I have?
[02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:46.430]  I'm guessing Husky.
[02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:49.630]  I don't know that one.
[02:26:49.630 --> 02:26:52.230]  I'm gonna say it's a smaller dog though.
[02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:53.750]  I don't think it's a bigger dog.
[02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:55.030]  I think it's like one of those.
[02:26:55.030 --> 02:26:56.430]  Lap dog.
[02:26:56.430 --> 02:27:00.830]  It's a Shih Tzu style dog.
[02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:02.030]  That's what I think.
[02:27:02.030 --> 02:27:05.710]  I feel like that thing would get mauled if it were outside.
[02:27:05.710 --> 02:27:07.150]  I'm gonna say like a Bulldog.
[02:27:07.150 --> 02:27:08.670]  I'm gonna give you a Bulldog.
[02:27:08.670 --> 02:27:10.310]  Blug, you can't win again.
[02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:13.630]  Is that right?
[02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:15.270]  Is that right?
[02:27:15.270 --> 02:27:16.550]  Yes.
[02:27:19.330 --> 02:27:21.130]  That was a pure guess, bro.
[02:27:21.130 --> 02:27:22.730]  Pure fucking.
[02:27:22.730 --> 02:27:24.170]  It's an English Bulldog.
[02:27:24.170 --> 02:27:25.490]  It's an English Bulldog.
[02:27:27.210 --> 02:27:29.370]  We're gonna give that one to Oliver Doisey.
[02:27:29.370 --> 02:27:31.130]  Oh, Oliver, that's my buddy in France.
[02:27:31.130 --> 02:27:32.610]  You can't guess either.
[02:27:34.730 --> 02:27:37.610]  I'll donate that to someone else that has no idea, honestly.
[02:27:37.610 --> 02:27:38.850]  I have a Boston Terrier.
[02:27:38.850 --> 02:27:39.690]  It's a Bulldog.
[02:27:39.690 --> 02:27:41.330]  Okay, Arnie.
[02:27:41.330 --> 02:27:44.530]  Arnie S, you're the first one I saw that I don't know
[02:27:44.530 --> 02:27:46.930]  that actually got the answer.
[02:27:46.970 --> 02:27:50.010]  Arnie S, shoot me an email.
[02:27:50.010 --> 02:27:51.050]  Making a note here.
[02:27:51.930 --> 02:27:56.290]  Shoot me an email at thenw47 at gmail.com
[02:27:56.290 --> 02:27:59.490]  and we'll get you out some Kush creams.
[02:28:01.610 --> 02:28:02.570]  Excellent.
[02:28:02.570 --> 02:28:03.410]  All right.
[02:28:07.810 --> 02:28:12.410]  Well, why don't we wrap it up?
[02:28:12.410 --> 02:28:13.890]  Before you close it up, did you,
[02:28:13.890 --> 02:28:15.370]  I don't know if we had a chance to,
[02:28:15.370 --> 02:28:17.370]  from the auction we did the other night.
[02:28:17.490 --> 02:28:18.330]  Oh yeah.
[02:28:18.330 --> 02:28:22.090]  So if these people are watching right now,
[02:28:22.090 --> 02:28:24.090]  you owe a lot of money.
[02:28:24.090 --> 02:28:27.330]  Yeah, we're looking for a Soviet Smoker.
[02:28:27.330 --> 02:28:30.010]  And what did Soviet Smoker bid on and for how much?
[02:28:30.010 --> 02:28:31.490]  I feel like these people were like,
[02:28:31.490 --> 02:28:34.210]  I'm gonna bid like $10,000.
[02:28:34.210 --> 02:28:38.210]  Let's not call out the money because it's, yeah.
[02:28:38.210 --> 02:28:43.050]  Staten Island, he did both packs of Kevstar.
[02:28:43.050 --> 02:28:47.010]  And so whoever he is, he is definitely the big, big mistake.
[02:28:47.850 --> 02:28:49.770]  He needs to step up.
[02:28:49.770 --> 02:28:52.810]  Yeah, and then I'm also looking for D2 from Detroit
[02:28:52.810 --> 02:28:55.570]  who bought a $300 pack from Old Factory.
[02:28:55.570 --> 02:28:59.130]  And I think that we just maybe missed him in communication.
[02:28:59.130 --> 02:29:02.810]  So Soviet Smoker, D2 from Detroit,
[02:29:02.810 --> 02:29:07.250]  and then the big MIA Ghoster was Staten Island
[02:29:08.490 --> 02:29:10.250]  for the BLR packs.
[02:29:10.250 --> 02:29:12.410]  And there's folks that are gonna,
[02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:16.610]  that wanna buy those packs for very similar amounts.
[02:29:17.450 --> 02:29:20.330]  Your time is limited, please contact us.
[02:29:20.330 --> 02:29:23.010]  Yeah, and shout out the folks that bid on the packs
[02:29:23.010 --> 02:29:26.490]  that we put up and boxed up, those go out tomorrow.
[02:29:26.490 --> 02:29:28.170]  I know a couple of you guys contacted me
[02:29:28.170 --> 02:29:29.410]  and I let you guys know those were coming,
[02:29:29.410 --> 02:29:31.570]  but big ups, appreciate your support.
[02:29:31.570 --> 02:29:32.490]  That's super cool.
[02:29:32.490 --> 02:29:34.370]  Well, Josh, do you remember the names
[02:29:34.370 --> 02:29:37.770]  of the people who won his stuff?
[02:29:37.770 --> 02:29:42.690]  Yeah, there was Jonathan Davis took the Coffee Cubed
[02:29:42.690 --> 02:29:45.450]  and was a beef.
[02:29:45.450 --> 02:29:47.290]  My handwriting is so fucking bad,
[02:29:47.290 --> 02:29:48.250]  I can't even read it myself.
[02:29:48.250 --> 02:29:49.930]  I'd be par, I'd be par.
[02:29:49.930 --> 02:29:52.610]  I'd be par, yeah, he won the Matterhorn,
[02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:55.090]  which was the TK Cross Coffee, what was that?
[02:29:55.090 --> 02:29:57.370]  Yeah, yep, that was a TK Cross with Coffee.
[02:29:57.370 --> 02:29:59.970]  And both you guys, I'm actually sending you each,
[02:29:59.970 --> 02:30:00.810]  both of those packs.
[02:30:00.810 --> 02:30:04.410]  So you both get the Cube, you both get the Matterhorn,
[02:30:04.410 --> 02:30:06.490]  and I'm loading you up with some stickers
[02:30:06.490 --> 02:30:07.570]  and all kinds of cool stuff
[02:30:07.570 --> 02:30:09.130]  because I really appreciate it
[02:30:09.130 --> 02:30:10.690]  when people step out like that.
[02:30:10.690 --> 02:30:11.530]  Yo, I have some-
[02:30:11.530 --> 02:30:12.930]  I'm gonna get the Matterhorn.
[02:30:12.930 --> 02:30:15.050]  Me too, I'm so hype on that one.
[02:30:15.970 --> 02:30:17.970]  I cannot wait to grow that one.
[02:30:17.970 --> 02:30:19.530]  That shit has got me hype.
[02:30:19.530 --> 02:30:22.930]  Yeah, yeah, we've seen some pretty dope phenos of it, man.
[02:30:22.930 --> 02:30:24.210]  It's a frosty bugger.
[02:30:25.610 --> 02:30:27.130]  All gas.
[02:30:27.130 --> 02:30:27.970]  Yes, sir.
[02:30:31.370 --> 02:30:35.730]  All right, well on that, should we call it a night?
[02:30:35.730 --> 02:30:36.570]  Let's call it a night.
[02:30:36.570 --> 02:30:38.370]  Thank you guys, I appreciate you having us on.
[02:30:38.370 --> 02:30:40.370]  You can find our seeds at Neptune Seed Bank.
[02:30:40.370 --> 02:30:41.250]  Seeds here now.

[02:30:55.050 --> 02:30:56.210]  Shout out, Blue.
[02:30:57.210 --> 02:31:02.210]  Oh, and Josh, someone asked about your seeds.
[02:31:05.130 --> 02:31:07.770]  When can we expect a seed drop from Josh?
[02:31:07.770 --> 02:31:08.610]  MV now.
[02:31:10.090 --> 02:31:12.650]  Probably December, January.
[02:31:13.650 --> 02:31:17.810]  We've definitely got stuff that we need to test.
[02:31:17.810 --> 02:31:21.490]  So that's the goal, December, January.
[02:31:23.850 --> 02:31:25.490]  And there's the answer.
[02:31:25.490 --> 02:31:26.650]  Yeah.
[02:31:26.650 --> 02:31:30.730]  All right, with that, I'm gonna kill the live stream.
[02:31:30.730 --> 02:31:31.570]  Thank you, everyone.
[02:31:31.570 --> 02:31:32.410]  Have a good night.
[02:31:32.410 --> 02:31:36.810]  And Blue, you gotta get your DJ next time
[02:31:36.810 --> 02:31:38.770]  because we could be late.
[02:31:38.770 --> 02:31:41.290]  Let's cut to the main D.
[02:31:41.290 --> 02:31:43.690]  Who'd you recommend again?
[02:31:43.690 --> 02:31:44.970]  Giant Eagle Beats, man.
[02:31:44.970 --> 02:31:46.290]  My man, Giant Eagle Beats,
[02:31:46.290 --> 02:31:49.170]  at Giant Eagle Beats on Instagram.
[02:31:50.930 --> 02:31:53.250]  Was he in the studio tonight?
[02:31:53.250 --> 02:31:54.210]  That's my man.
[02:31:54.210 --> 02:31:57.290]  He's a producer and an incredible DJ, yes.
[02:31:57.290 --> 02:31:58.850]  So can you get on him?
[02:32:00.130 --> 02:32:01.530]  I mean, I don't have to get on him.
[02:32:01.530 --> 02:32:03.130]  We're every Monday night, man.
[02:32:03.130 --> 02:32:05.010]  If it's Monday night, it's Music Monday.

[02:32:27.090 --> 02:32:27.930]  We can do that.
[02:32:27.930 --> 02:32:28.770]  We can do that.
[02:32:28.770 --> 02:32:29.610]  Yeah.
[02:32:29.610 --> 02:32:30.450]  Right?
[02:32:30.450 --> 02:32:31.290]  Yeah.
[02:32:31.290 --> 02:32:32.930]  I spit, I'll shoot the gif.
[02:32:32.930 --> 02:32:34.250]  I'll shoot it.
[02:32:34.250 --> 02:32:35.650]  Yeah.

[02:32:44.850 --> 02:32:45.850]  You got a great mind.

[02:32:47.410 --> 02:32:50.130]  And Peter, thank you for making a venue
[02:32:50.130 --> 02:32:53.250]  for some amazing people talking some shit.

[02:32:55.850 --> 02:32:56.690]  Have a good night, Blue.
[02:32:56.690 --> 02:32:58.370]  We're gonna kill the live stream.
[02:32:58.370 --> 02:32:59.530]  Have a good night, everyone.
