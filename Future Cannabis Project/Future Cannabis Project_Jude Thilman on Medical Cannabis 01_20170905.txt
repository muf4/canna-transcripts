[00:00.000 --> 00:20.470]  We're in the infancy still, infant stages of understanding the science of cannabis.
[00:20.470 --> 00:23.210]  Science, cannabis has been around for 5,000 years.
[00:23.210 --> 00:28.950]  We have written records going back to the pharaohs of Egypt, the emperors of China.
[00:28.950 --> 00:36.890]  It's been used as an effective healer and treater of dis-ease and symptoms from ill
[00:36.890 --> 00:41.510]  health for all those thousands of years, but without anybody understanding why.
[00:41.510 --> 00:48.530]  So our shamans, our witch doctors, our midwives, all of our traditional healers, hands-on healers,
[00:48.530 --> 00:51.270]  first of all, they knew that holistic healing had to happen.
[00:51.270 --> 00:54.070]  It was a question of what you ate, what you did with your body.
[00:54.070 --> 00:59.310]  They used music and drums and they used sound, they used food, they used everything.
[00:59.310 --> 01:03.770]  And they understood that the body, because we are a complex organism, it wants lots of
[01:03.770 --> 01:07.690]  different kinds of healing modalities.
[01:07.690 --> 01:10.450]  So they understood all that, but they didn't understand the science of it.
[01:10.450 --> 01:14.530]  We didn't begin to understand the science of it until the second half of the 20th century.
[01:14.530 --> 01:19.410]  Think about this, we only started to learn about the lymph system in the mid-20th century.
[01:19.410 --> 01:23.250]  And to this date, I've had 14 surgeries, and every surgeon I ever talked to, I said,
[01:23.250 --> 01:27.730]  well, do you check to see where my lymph nodes are before you go in there and slash them
[01:27.730 --> 01:28.730]  open?
[01:28.730 --> 01:30.250]  And they go like, no, we don't think of that.
[01:30.250 --> 01:34.370]  In Europe, they ask the lymph doctor to come in and show where the lymph nodes are before
[01:34.370 --> 01:36.410]  they start cutting through them.
[01:36.410 --> 01:39.610]  We are so far behind, they don't teach you nutrition in medical school.
[01:39.610 --> 01:47.330]  Allopathy in this country has been deeply, deeply shaped and formed by the pharmaceutical
[01:47.330 --> 01:51.690]  industry, which came out of making the gases for World War I.
[01:51.690 --> 01:55.550]  And unfortunately for those guys, they ended World War I, so they had all these toys and
[01:55.550 --> 01:56.550]  nothing to do with them.
[01:56.550 --> 01:58.210]  So they went into fertilizers.
[01:58.210 --> 02:04.170]  They moved from fertilizers into creating these so-called medicines, chemical compounds
[02:04.170 --> 02:06.890]  that they would treat symptoms with to some effect.
[02:06.890 --> 02:13.930]  And then they embarked on a four-decade-long mass marketing scheme to convince people that
[02:13.930 --> 02:21.090]  certain diagnoses, boxes that they came up with, such as schizophrenia, depression, and
[02:21.090 --> 02:30.750]  then later, bipolar, autism, ADHD, all of that stuff requires Prozac or Valium or Ritalin.
[02:30.750 --> 02:32.050]  So they created this market.
[02:32.050 --> 02:37.410]  If you want to learn how this all worked out, I highly recommend a book called Anatomy of
[02:37.410 --> 02:39.450]  an Epidemic by Robert Whitaker.
[02:39.450 --> 02:42.410]  Anyway, it traces the whole history of the pharmaceutical industry.
[02:42.410 --> 02:47.450]  What's important about that to us is that we in the cannabis industry come out of something
[02:47.450 --> 02:54.170]  quite different, which is, unbeknownst to us almost, this thousands of years tradition
[02:54.170 --> 02:55.170]  of herbal healing.
[02:55.170 --> 03:01.410]  And it's so contrary to allopathy, which Western medicine, allopathic medicine, pharmaceutically
[03:01.410 --> 03:07.730]  shaped medicine is about altering the body's chemistry in order to supposedly heal, but
[03:07.730 --> 03:11.370]  really to suppress symptoms and make you feel a little bit better.
[03:11.370 --> 03:13.010]  They're the smartest guys in the room.
[03:13.010 --> 03:18.050]  They, in the meantime, create side effects that require more pharmaceuticals to treat them.
[03:18.050 --> 03:20.450]  So it's this vicious cycle.
[03:20.450 --> 03:27.450]  There was in the sequel to the original Rick Simpson, Phoenix Tears movie, the producers
[03:27.450 --> 03:31.930]  went to a big pharmaceutical convention in Paris and they said, they went around all
[03:31.930 --> 03:33.730]  the booths and there's just lackeys at the booths.
[03:33.730 --> 03:37.210]  There's no big wigs from big pharma.
[03:37.210 --> 03:40.970]  And they were talking about, oh, and this year Pfizer did this and Merck did this and
[03:40.970 --> 03:41.970]  Johnson and Johnson did this.
[03:41.970 --> 03:44.970]  And they were coming up with all these great bragging points, you know, and finally the
[03:44.970 --> 03:47.410]  producer said, well, what have they done to cure cancer?
[03:47.410 --> 03:51.530]  And the guy threw his hands up and said, why would they want to cure cancer?
[03:51.530 --> 03:54.970]  So we're up against a perception.
[03:54.970 --> 03:59.330]  And it's like I was over at my booth the other, over there, this sort of, well, how do you
[03:59.330 --> 04:01.370]  get proper dosing?
[04:01.370 --> 04:05.610]  Well, if you look at our video that we created and we have a 35 year public health nurse
[04:05.610 --> 04:11.050]  who had severe tendon rupture and had to have wrist surgery.
[04:11.050 --> 04:15.730]  The doctor said, well, I would, she was using cannabis for pain and the doctor said, well,
[04:15.730 --> 04:18.890]  the problem I have with cannabis is we can't figure out the dosing.
[04:18.890 --> 04:23.690]  If you watch our video on any of our websites, she's so good.
[04:23.690 --> 04:25.770]  Barbara Rowe Pryde is her name, this nurse.
[04:25.770 --> 04:28.770]  And she says, well, doctor, let's look at what you just gave me.
[04:28.770 --> 04:32.170]  You gave me 40 Norco, pretty strong medicine.
[04:32.170 --> 04:33.170]  Who's in charge of the dose?
[04:33.170 --> 04:34.650]  And he just looked at her.
[04:34.690 --> 04:38.610]  And she says, it says, take two to three every three to four hours as needed.
[04:38.610 --> 04:39.610]  Who's in charge of the dose?
[04:39.610 --> 04:40.810]  The patient's in charge of the dose.
[04:40.810 --> 04:43.690]  And what do you do when you're sitting on the toilet at two, three in the morning, you're
[04:43.690 --> 04:47.930]  so dehydrated that you're dizzy, you're falling off the toilet because you kept taking them
[04:47.930 --> 04:49.770]  because it wasn't doing anything for your pain.
[04:49.770 --> 04:51.850]  Well, you might've overdosed on it.
[04:51.850 --> 04:56.690]  Well, with, with cannabis medicine, the bad news is we have to do the same kind of art
[04:56.690 --> 05:01.810]  and science of figuring out what's the ratio and what's the dose for our particular, our
[05:01.810 --> 05:06.810]  particular conditions, certainly our particular metabolism, even trickier.
[05:06.810 --> 05:10.970]  But beyond that, on the good side, we can't do any harm.
[05:10.970 --> 05:13.370]  We're not causing liver and kidney damage or stomach damage.
[05:13.370 --> 05:15.450]  Sometimes it doesn't work, but it doesn't hurt.
[05:15.450 --> 05:19.530]  You just switch to a different, either a different delivery system, a different ratio, a different
[05:19.530 --> 05:21.690]  dosage, whatever it is.
[05:21.690 --> 05:24.410]  We are at the beginning stages of understanding this.
[05:24.410 --> 05:29.610]  You go to cannabis, medical cannabis conferences, and we're learning all these great new scientific
[05:29.610 --> 05:31.170]  facts about how cannabis works.
[05:31.530 --> 05:35.210]  Do you know how far away we are from actually operationalizing these facts?
[05:35.210 --> 05:41.170]  The fact of how the CBD receptors, the CB1 receptors, the CB2 receptors, the TRPV1 receptors
[05:41.170 --> 05:46.190]  in our body, the receptors in our skin, how do they actually engage the phyto cannabinoids
[05:46.190 --> 05:51.650]  from the plant and, and kickstart the body's natural healing processes, which is what our
[05:51.650 --> 05:57.730]  body has the capability of doing on a cellular level, healing anything, any dis-ease that
[05:57.730 --> 05:59.770]  ha, that hits us.
[05:59.770 --> 06:01.010]  Cannabis know when they're sick.
[06:01.010 --> 06:02.930]  They switch plants, they know what to eat.
[06:02.930 --> 06:03.930]  They know what to eat.
[06:03.930 --> 06:04.930]  So.
[06:04.930 --> 06:06.690]  What's the, what's the TRPV receptor?
[06:06.690 --> 06:11.090]  The TRPV1 receptors in the, the Arcata conference, which I really want to talk about in a second
[06:11.090 --> 06:15.730]  because it tries to bring together Western medicine with herbal medicine.
[06:15.730 --> 06:18.210]  They Ethan Russo, you may know him.
[06:18.210 --> 06:19.970]  He's a leading researcher.
[06:19.970 --> 06:22.610]  He announced that they discovered a new set of receptors.
[06:22.610 --> 06:25.290]  CB1, CB2, not the only ones.
[06:25.290 --> 06:26.730]  TRPV1 is another one.
[06:26.730 --> 06:27.730]  And it does a whole bunch of other different things.
[06:27.730 --> 06:29.050]  It's a cannabinoid receptor.
[06:29.810 --> 06:32.130]  So it's a whole other receptor site.
[06:32.130 --> 06:33.130]  And there are more.
[06:33.130 --> 06:34.130]  We'll find out more.
[06:34.130 --> 06:36.650]  Right now we know there's at least 113 cannabinoids.
[06:36.650 --> 06:38.130]  That's just what we know about.
[06:38.130 --> 06:41.930]  We are beginning to understand that terpenes have more to do with healing than not, than
[06:41.930 --> 06:43.530]  making the bud smell good.
[06:43.530 --> 06:45.410]  We're just beginning to understand that.
[06:45.410 --> 06:46.410]  Same with flavonoids.
[06:46.410 --> 06:47.610]  We haven't even touched it.
[06:47.610 --> 06:52.190]  So we're at the beginning stages and yet we're, we're increasing our knowledge base by leaps
[06:52.190 --> 06:57.370]  and bounds in, in very short time period because we've got these great studies going on at
[06:57.370 --> 07:04.050]  Plotensi in Madrid, in, in, at Oxford, at Hebrew University with Dr. Bershulam, in Brazil,
[07:04.050 --> 07:06.810]  and with our own people who are doing it sort of below the radar.
[07:06.810 --> 07:08.290]  We're finding things out every day.
[07:08.290 --> 07:13.530]  But do you know how far away from that abstract theoretical knowledge, whether it's animal
[07:13.530 --> 07:20.810]  models or just laboratory work, how far away from that understanding we are to operationalizing
[07:20.810 --> 07:26.330]  it in a cultivator setting or a cannabis medicine manufacturing setting?
[07:26.330 --> 07:31.130]  I mean, when you look at the big picture, we are so far away from that.
[07:31.130 --> 07:37.850]  And then throw in 40 years of misinformation and disinformation that the public has been
[07:37.850 --> 07:44.490]  subject to because of prohibition and fear, the fear factor, and throw in the fact that
[07:44.490 --> 07:49.890]  who sits on the board of the, who's the majority of people sitting in seats of the FDA or the
[07:49.890 --> 07:52.730]  DEA, members of the pharmaceutical industry?
[07:53.130 --> 07:59.210]  How are these poor folks going to ever bridge that gap?
[07:59.210 --> 08:01.370]  There's nothing in place to have that happen.
[08:01.370 --> 08:05.850]  Well, the industry, the good elements of the industry have to lead the regulation.
[08:05.850 --> 08:10.690]  I mean, I'm not a huge fan of regulation, but regulation actually will help the cannabis
[08:10.690 --> 08:17.570]  industry because it will separate the real medical operators from the recreational operators.
[08:17.570 --> 08:19.770]  And that's the biggest, that's the hardest for me.
[08:19.770 --> 08:20.770]  That's what I've seen.
[08:20.810 --> 08:30.810]  That's the hardest element to break through in getting people to really understand that
[08:30.810 --> 08:32.610]  the stigma continues, I guess.
[08:32.610 --> 08:37.250]  We're destigmatizing it in one way, but then very simultaneously we're restigmatizing it
[08:37.250 --> 08:41.130]  by selling medicine from basically a recreational shop.
[08:41.130 --> 08:42.130]  Well, this is the thing.
[08:42.130 --> 08:46.170]  I'm glad you brought up regulation because I wear a three-pointed hat.
[08:46.170 --> 08:50.530]  One is, I run a dispensary and a wellness center and I work with patients every day.
[08:51.290 --> 08:52.290]  That's really important.
[08:52.290 --> 08:53.490]  I do patient education and public education.
[08:53.490 --> 08:54.490]  That's really important.
[08:54.490 --> 08:59.890]  The other is that I'm trying to bridge the gap between those people who are into the
[08:59.890 --> 09:04.690]  sales and the marketing aspect of the cannabis industry and those people who are hands-on
[09:04.690 --> 09:08.490]  creating the medicine and get them to talk to each other and, hey, by the way, let's
[09:08.490 --> 09:10.050]  talk to the patients as well.
[09:10.050 --> 09:15.090]  But my other corner of my hat, all my life I've been an activist around policy.
[09:15.090 --> 09:20.190]  So I've spent countless hours in Sacramento lobbying with the legislators before we ever
[09:20.230 --> 09:22.950]  got MACRSA, putting those bills together.
[09:22.950 --> 09:24.630]  Ukiah with the board of supervisors.
[09:24.630 --> 09:27.910]  So I'm a political activist and I have been all my life.
[09:27.910 --> 09:32.870]  It's sort of like you walk in and the wink, wink, nod, nod is alive and well.
[09:32.870 --> 09:34.750]  Medical, right.
[09:34.750 --> 09:35.750]  You bet.
[09:35.750 --> 09:36.750]  Medical.
[09:36.750 --> 09:37.750]  So what are they doing?
[09:37.750 --> 09:42.750]  I had a patient come in to me just this last Sunday, a dragonfly.
[09:42.750 --> 09:44.030]  He's about 60 years old.
[09:44.030 --> 09:45.910]  He's got an autoimmune disease.
[09:45.910 --> 09:50.110]  He drove from Nevada to try to get some medicine here.
[09:51.030 --> 09:52.030]  I said, well, what's going on?
[09:52.030 --> 09:53.030]  You've got medicine in Nevada.
[09:53.030 --> 09:54.630]  And he goes, I'll tell you what's going on.
[09:54.630 --> 09:59.590]  I've been going to a certain dispensary and I get my tincture and it helps with my autoimmune
[09:59.590 --> 10:00.590]  disease.
[10:00.590 --> 10:02.710]  Then Nevada passed this recreational law.
[10:02.710 --> 10:04.710]  I went back to my dispensary.
[10:04.710 --> 10:07.370]  There were two entrances, two lines.
[10:07.370 --> 10:10.110]  The recreational was out the door and around the block.
[10:10.110 --> 10:13.750]  There were two people in line at the medical counter.
[10:13.750 --> 10:16.550]  I went up to the medical line, two people.
[10:16.550 --> 10:19.110]  I thought, well, that's good, I guess.
[10:19.110 --> 10:23.350]  He gets up to the front and they said, no, we don't have room on our shelves anymore
[10:23.350 --> 10:29.070]  because the money is all behind the rec and the adult use.
[10:29.070 --> 10:30.070]  Same thing in Oregon.
[10:30.070 --> 10:31.710]  Oregon had rough parity.
[10:31.710 --> 10:36.430]  Dr. Christian Lay, who's a cannabis physician and has cannabis clinics throughout Oregon,
[10:36.430 --> 10:38.030]  you may know him.
[10:38.030 --> 10:43.150]  I had interviewed him at the Arcata Conference, which I want to talk about in a second.
[10:43.150 --> 10:48.790]  He said they had rough parity, the equal numbers of medical dispensaries and recreational dispensaries
[10:49.470 --> 10:51.470]  in the state made the dispensaries choose.
[10:51.470 --> 10:56.790]  If you have to choose and you're a dispensary owner, you can choose to go down the toilet
[10:56.790 --> 11:01.790]  with medical, even if you passionately believe that that's ... How do you stay alive?
[11:01.790 --> 11:02.790]  Race to failure, yeah.
[11:02.790 --> 11:04.190]  Race to failure, exactly.
[11:04.190 --> 11:08.390]  Now, once Oregon decided to do that, the ratio has changed to 14 to 1.
[11:08.390 --> 11:10.230]  Guess what the tilt is?
[11:10.230 --> 11:12.070]  For me, I paid $40.
[11:12.070 --> 11:15.150]  I've been legal since 2011 when I opened my dispensary and wellness center.
[11:15.150 --> 11:18.710]  I pay $40 a year to the county for a business license.
[11:18.710 --> 11:24.790]  Now, I'm paying 5% of gross sales every three months starting January 1st, 2017 to the county.
[11:24.790 --> 11:28.230]  Just off medicine, I've had to lay staff off.
[11:28.230 --> 11:31.630]  I've had to shrink my compassion program, but that's not all.
[11:31.630 --> 11:36.390]  On the state level, if I want to stay alive, I've got to get both a medical and an adult
[11:36.390 --> 11:40.110]  use license because of what we just said.
[11:40.110 --> 11:45.470]  They're going to cost, based on gross sales, they'll cost me $7,500 a piece annually.
[11:45.470 --> 11:51.350]  That's $15,000 a year annually just for my state licenses to run a dispensary.
[11:51.350 --> 11:53.070]  Is that not going to put me down the toilet?
