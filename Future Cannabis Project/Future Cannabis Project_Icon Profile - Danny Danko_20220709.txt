[00:11.900 --> 00:19.580]  And welcome everybody back to another episode of the friendly cannabis show a very special one today
[00:19.580 --> 00:25.600]  I'm here with someone I've admired for a long time. Mr. Danny Danko. How you doing today, sir? Hey, thank you
[00:25.600 --> 00:30.980]  I'm good. I'm good. Good good. Well again, you know, thank you for making the time to be here
[00:31.220 --> 00:34.940]  You know, I'm definitely excited. I know a lot of other people out there are excited
[00:35.940 --> 00:41.920]  But I want to ask about something that you've probably been excited for I see you got the you got the Mets hat on
[00:43.040 --> 00:45.580]  How long how long have you lived in the New York area?
[00:46.160 --> 00:49.400]  Yeah, I basically moved here after graduating from college in
[00:49.960 --> 00:56.840]  94 from BU I grew up in the Boston area and then basically moved here around 94 95 and
[00:57.620 --> 00:59.620]  Yeah, you know been a Mets fan
[00:59.620 --> 01:04.980]  Today was the reason I'm wearing the hat is today was the retirement of Keith Hernandez's number at
[01:05.980 --> 01:10.020]  At Citi Field, so that was exciting. And yeah, just you know
[01:11.780 --> 01:13.780]  Been here in New York and
[01:14.100 --> 01:16.100]  part of the cannabis scene here
[01:16.620 --> 01:21.900]  Since long before there was any sort of legal framework or even medical or anything. So
[01:22.820 --> 01:26.700]  It's been it's been a fun ride. I love New York. I love Boston and
[01:26.820 --> 01:28.820]  You know just
[01:29.820 --> 01:31.820]  Enjoying living here
[01:31.820 --> 01:35.660]  Enjoying the East Coast. I've always you know kind of lived on the West Coast when I was younger
[01:35.660 --> 01:39.980]  I did live near the Chicago area. So to finally see and this is when I was a kid
[01:39.980 --> 01:42.380]  So, you know the Cubs became my team
[01:43.020 --> 01:48.780]  I waited a long time to see them win a World Series, but it finally happened and I bought a hat for the series
[01:48.780 --> 01:51.020]  So I'll just say that's why they won
[01:51.820 --> 01:54.620]  Right on. Yeah, and you know, it's just exciting to see
[01:54.740 --> 01:56.740]  The
[01:56.860 --> 02:01.540]  Cannabis situation become more open and more legal here in the Northeast and
[02:02.460 --> 02:08.140]  It's it's really just been a pleasure to be a part of it and play any kind of role in that
[02:08.620 --> 02:12.460]  And you have you've had a big role in it, you know, you've you've done a lot of writing
[02:12.460 --> 02:17.020]  You've done a lot of advocacy, but I'm curious as just like the average citizen
[02:17.020 --> 02:22.260]  What kind of changes have you noticed or how is life different from I mean, obviously
[02:22.260 --> 02:25.940]  The 90s it was it was pretty hard crackdown things eased up
[02:25.940 --> 02:28.820]  But what is it like today as just like your average citizen?
[02:29.540 --> 02:31.540]  Yeah, I mean things have changed
[02:31.840 --> 02:34.980]  Dramatically in those days you're talking about the 90s
[02:35.540 --> 02:38.340]  both at the Boston Freedom Rally and here in New York at the
[02:39.060 --> 02:42.100]  Million Marijuana March if you lit up a joint you were
[02:42.820 --> 02:45.860]  Arrested immediately run through the system
[02:46.500 --> 02:49.700]  Fingerprinted all of it and and that happened
[02:49.700 --> 02:53.140]  You know to hundreds of people in Boston hundreds of people here in New York
[02:53.940 --> 02:59.140]  You know there was crackdowns and then that's because the laws were the way they were and if you talk to the police
[02:59.140 --> 03:02.500]  They would say hey, we're just enforcing the laws, you know
[03:03.300 --> 03:05.300]  you just got to change the laws and
[03:06.260 --> 03:07.940]  lo and behold
[03:07.940 --> 03:13.140]  we did you know as a collective group and those laws have changed and it's interesting because
[03:13.860 --> 03:17.700]  They didn't really hold true to to their that their values
[03:17.700 --> 03:19.700]  And I think that's true
[03:19.700 --> 03:23.140]  To their that their side of that bargain because they're still harassing
[03:24.020 --> 03:27.620]  Cannabis users and patients. There's still people locked up in prison
[03:28.580 --> 03:34.580]  There's still records to be expunged and still a stigma against cannabis. You know, I mean even here
[03:35.620 --> 03:40.660]  people obviously I smell a lot more cannabis smoke in the streets and all of that and there's
[03:41.700 --> 03:43.700]  de facto sort of
[03:43.700 --> 03:51.700]  Boundaries and even quasi sort of gray area dispensaries, but the problem is is they're all still under attack
[03:52.260 --> 03:53.140]  um
[03:53.140 --> 03:56.980]  Any one of them can be raided at any time. They've gotten cease and desist orders
[03:57.540 --> 04:02.740]  And they've they're they're threatened with not being allowed to be part of the legal framework
[04:03.300 --> 04:04.720]  when that uh
[04:04.720 --> 04:11.300]  Finally gets established now. Meanwhile, we legalized over a year ago and that and still they have not come up with that framework. So
[04:11.780 --> 04:14.260]  Obviously people are going to fill the void and now
[04:15.060 --> 04:19.700]  Those people are under threat and they're probably the best people to fill the void as well
[04:20.100 --> 04:24.600]  You know, so I see this uh over and over as well in colorado and washington
[04:25.060 --> 04:28.040]  Where people who were involved in the underground?
[04:28.740 --> 04:35.700]  Side of the industry are locked out of the legal side and they're really the ones who actually deserve that the most
[04:36.580 --> 04:43.380]  Yeah, the the social equity aspect of things are kind of nice now, you know, you mentioned people, you know, they were getting cracked down
[04:43.700 --> 04:44.580]  um
[04:44.580 --> 04:48.500]  You know the 90s is kind of when I was discovering weed and doing all this stuff as well
[04:48.820 --> 04:50.900]  Um, i've had friends busted for you know
[04:50.900 --> 04:55.620]  The the proverbial 10 sack and couldn't get a college loan anymore because it was you know
[04:55.700 --> 04:59.220]  a federal loan and just the bs that went along with that so
[05:00.100 --> 05:01.140]  uh
[05:01.140 --> 05:04.500]  You know that stinks that is still under attack, but the gray area. Yeah
[05:04.740 --> 05:05.700]  um
[05:05.700 --> 05:12.100]  Hopefully there'll be some lessons learned from california a lot of the legacy growers and facilities out there
[05:12.580 --> 05:17.960]  Have just been pushed out of the legal framework when it's finally come about it's so cost prohibitive
[05:19.060 --> 05:25.300]  And then again being in washington. Yeah, I was part of the medical system. And so that's where a lot of the education was but
[05:26.180 --> 05:31.380]  Limited licenses can't get loans. It was it was a tough sell for us to get into it
[05:31.860 --> 05:36.660]  um, do you see some uh positive or some good actors out there that may be you know,
[05:36.740 --> 05:40.420]  Like kind of spearheading the charge for others to maybe follow that example
[05:40.900 --> 05:43.700]  Oh, absolutely. Um, you know, I think there's this bias
[05:44.180 --> 05:49.620]  uh within our culture and our community against uh, you know corporate cannabis and and
[05:50.980 --> 05:54.820]  multi-state operators and all of these um sort of you know
[05:56.160 --> 05:58.340]  newcomers to the industry but there are
[05:58.900 --> 06:03.700]  Uh legacy operators that are succeeding and I mean just off the top of my head I would say
[06:04.340 --> 06:11.060]  um in massachusetts, there's a can of provisions they sell people clones, uh, so they can grow their own at home
[06:11.460 --> 06:17.140]  They have chem dog growing hem dog strains for sale in the legal marketplace
[06:17.540 --> 06:20.740]  Um out west there's craft in the bay area
[06:21.140 --> 06:25.540]  Um, there's ic collective. There's all these amazing. Um,
[06:26.180 --> 06:28.180]  You know legacy
[06:28.660 --> 06:36.100]  Brands that some might deem to be corporate but they're working within the legal framework and they are places where you can purchase
[06:36.560 --> 06:37.620]  legit
[06:37.620 --> 06:41.940]  great cannabis products and uh, so for every you know for every
[06:43.220 --> 06:49.540]  Sort of midzi kind of place. There are places you can seek out and vote with your pocketbook vote with your dollar
[06:49.940 --> 06:55.220]  Uh and spend the money at those places and another thing I always champion is hey grow your own
[06:55.380 --> 06:59.380]  You know if you really if you really don't want to be part of the cannabis industry
[06:59.860 --> 07:02.340]  um, the the real solution is just to
[07:02.900 --> 07:07.380]  Get a little grow tent four by four or four by eight tent and grow your own
[07:07.940 --> 07:14.020]  And you'll always have high quality product. You'll know exactly what went into it. You'll know what the strains are if it's a specific
[07:14.900 --> 07:16.900]  preference or a medicinal need
[07:17.140 --> 07:22.900]  Um, and you'll know if there was pesticides or overfeeding or you know proper curing
[07:22.900 --> 07:29.540]  These are all things that home growers do and there's no better bud than the bud you grew yourself
[07:30.100 --> 07:33.140]  and not just the quality of it, but the feeling of
[07:34.020 --> 07:38.820]  You know creating something out of thin air just taking seeds light air water
[07:39.300 --> 07:43.300]  And being able to actually produce your own medicine your own
[07:44.180 --> 07:50.420]  Uh food for your soul. I think it's uh, it's really fulfilling whether you're medical rec whatever it is
[07:50.980 --> 07:54.360]  Um, and if you can't grow your own, you know form a collective
[07:55.220 --> 07:59.780]  um group together with a group of like-minded people I want to see a
[08:00.660 --> 08:05.940]  Cannabis industry where you can go to these msos. You can go to the dispensaries
[08:05.940 --> 08:12.180]  You can get delivery or you can go to a farmer's market and buy jars of locally grown cannabis by small farmers
[08:12.740 --> 08:13.860]  um
[08:13.860 --> 08:15.860]  The only problem is of course
[08:15.940 --> 08:19.000]  People have to adapt to the the lowering of the prices
[08:19.540 --> 08:22.340]  And act accordingly and that's why growing your own is so great
[08:22.420 --> 08:28.100]  It's like, you know pennies to the dollar, but if you're expecting to get four or five hundred dollars an ounce
[08:29.220 --> 08:34.660]  You know that times have changed and you know pounds are going for that amount now these days
[08:35.140 --> 08:39.140]  And so you have to adapt and and a lot of that cost was in the risk
[08:39.940 --> 08:43.160]  It's not it doesn't cost that much to grow this plant in a legal environment
[08:43.720 --> 08:46.360]  uh, I mean it does if it's over regulated and
[08:47.460 --> 08:50.200]  over taxed and all of that, but um
[08:50.840 --> 08:57.240]  It you know, the price was always in the risk when things were illegal. And so, you know as with anything
[08:57.720 --> 09:05.080]  Uh, you have to adapt and and that's something I think our community can do as well because we've always adapted when
[09:05.560 --> 09:07.400]  uh when it was
[09:07.400 --> 09:10.680]  foreign, uh cannabis being imported to america
[09:11.320 --> 09:15.320]  We bought you know colombian and mexican and jamaican and all these different things
[09:15.720 --> 09:18.840]  And then when there when there was a crackdown on that in the 70s
[09:18.840 --> 09:24.360]  That's when we learned to grow our own indoors and outdoors and when there was a crackdown on that
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.120]  uh, you know people developed auto flowering strains and
[09:28.840 --> 09:33.480]  So there's just there's always a way and we'll find it and I think um
[09:34.040 --> 09:38.440]  We're definitely in a better place than we were 10 or 15 or 20 years ago. That's for sure
[09:38.920 --> 09:43.480]  I know there's a struggle. Of course. It's it's tough on some of the farmers
[09:44.040 --> 09:44.840]  but
[09:44.840 --> 09:51.560]  uh, you know, you also have to counterbalance that with the fact that people were going to jail and having their lives, uh,
[09:52.120 --> 09:54.120]  you know drastically
[09:54.200 --> 09:59.400]  Changed being raided having their dogs shot and being separated from their families
[09:59.400 --> 10:05.640]  I mean, that's the reality of prohibition. So I don't long for those days. I don't know. I don't look back and say
[10:06.200 --> 10:08.200]  Oh, I wish I wish it was still illegal
[10:08.760 --> 10:12.220]  You know, I really don't and I know there's some that do and I understand
[10:13.240 --> 10:16.280]  but I feel like those are probably the people who did not
[10:17.240 --> 10:20.600]  have to go to jail or visit friends in prison or have
[10:21.800 --> 10:23.560]  you know peaceful
[10:23.560 --> 10:25.000]  cannabis people
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.480]  Uh be locked up in cages. It's it's it's uh, really outrageous. So
[10:30.040 --> 10:33.400]  We we have come a long way. We've still got a long way to go but uh
[10:33.800 --> 10:36.040]  I do think we've made a tremendous amount of progress
[10:36.840 --> 10:42.760]  We have and growing your own has been a huge part of that and you've been a champion of growing your own for a long time
[10:43.240 --> 10:44.280]  which
[10:44.280 --> 10:51.160]  You know is great. Um, I I could get into some of that later. I made a promise that I wouldn't fanboy on you. So, um,
[10:51.960 --> 10:57.240]  Just wanted to talk to you about kind of the changing climate. Um, i've been out here in washington again
[10:57.240 --> 11:02.280]  We've had legal markets for 10 years now, which is great and one of the magazines that popped up out here
[11:02.280 --> 11:04.760]  It was you know, the hot thing is we had our northwest leaf
[11:05.240 --> 11:09.720]  Uh, and these things, you know, you'd every time you run to the dispensary if they have a new issue
[11:09.720 --> 11:12.520]  You get excited you grab two one for yourself one for your friend
[11:13.320 --> 11:18.760]  Look at all the look at all the magazine or the articles. Look at all the pictures be like i've got to try that one
[11:19.720 --> 11:24.760]  Now with legalization going in the northeast you are representing the northeast leaf
[11:24.840 --> 11:29.900]  Yeah, indeed indeed which is in partnership with northwest leaf which started in 2010
[11:30.700 --> 11:32.700]  um my partners, uh
[11:33.740 --> 11:37.100]  Wes and and ricker and tom they they were involved
[11:37.660 --> 11:42.080]  Early on and uh art director daniel berman. They were involved in 2010
[11:42.700 --> 11:46.220]  in starting northwest leaf and they uh over the years expanded to
[11:46.860 --> 11:52.220]  Uh alaska leaf california leaf maryland leaf oregon leaf and just a couple years ago
[11:52.780 --> 11:57.180]  um after high times moved out to the west coast and uh,
[11:57.260 --> 12:01.820]  Basically, I was in limbo for for a minute there kind of without a gig
[12:02.380 --> 12:05.280]  Um just promoting my book and and doing my podcast
[12:05.900 --> 12:06.860]  um
[12:06.860 --> 12:09.180]  I approached we approached each other in hawaii
[12:09.740 --> 12:10.940]  and
[12:10.940 --> 12:17.340]  Yeah, it was amazing. It was at the hawaii cannabis expo and it was just it seemed like perfect like like kiss met like
[12:17.900 --> 12:23.820]  Like it was meant to be like fate, which is not something I always necessarily believe in but it really felt like that
[12:24.220 --> 12:25.980]  Um, I met them
[12:25.980 --> 12:32.220]  Uh, and they agreed to start northeast leaf magazine in the middle of the pandemic no less, you know
[12:32.780 --> 12:34.700]  uh in order to cover
[12:34.700 --> 12:40.300]  These eight states that we have from maine down to new york and new jersey and how much things are changing rapidly
[12:40.380 --> 12:44.140]  and it's been so exciting for me it really rejuvenated my um,
[12:45.020 --> 12:49.980]  Just my love of of print publishing and and educating people about cannabis
[12:50.460 --> 12:52.780]  And the other cool thing is it's a free magazine
[12:53.180 --> 12:55.580]  Um, you can pick it up at your dispensary at your head shop
[12:55.820 --> 13:00.300]  We charge our advertisers to reach reach the people but the people get the magazine for free
[13:00.780 --> 13:02.700]  And to me that's you know
[13:02.780 --> 13:09.580]  That's a great service people, you know, people are more reluctant these days to pay for for media that they can get for free online
[13:09.980 --> 13:12.480]  Um, so we have our online version at leafmagazines.com
[13:13.420 --> 13:19.980]  uh, we have uh our free print magazine as well. We have events called the leaf bowls that we're doing
[13:20.300 --> 13:22.300]  um so far in oregon
[13:22.460 --> 13:24.220]  uh and alaska
[13:24.220 --> 13:30.300]  Just there's one coming up in just a couple weeks in alaska, which you know, we're always excited to uh to be back doing events
[13:30.860 --> 13:34.620]  And yeah, it's just been a pleasure. I've been doing northeast leaf for two years now
[13:35.180 --> 13:36.780]  and um
[13:36.780 --> 13:38.780]  It's it's it's been an honor and a pleasure
[13:39.260 --> 13:44.140]  uh to put that together and to uh, serve the the community and the
[13:44.700 --> 13:51.340]  Industry and the culture of the northeast region, which is where I was raised and and where my cannabis, you know
[13:51.560 --> 13:54.220]  education and career and everything really
[13:55.100 --> 13:57.100]  Was all centered around
[13:57.740 --> 14:02.540]  It's an awesome progression for you because writing has always been a big part of what you do
[14:03.100 --> 14:07.180]  Um, you know cannabis in the northeast is been life
[14:07.900 --> 14:12.700]  So getting to combine those two that's great and for the people out there, too. Um,
[14:13.180 --> 14:15.260]  Again, they're they're so fun, you know, they're fun to pick up
[14:15.340 --> 14:19.040]  I actually I collect them here and then I send them to my buddy in amsterdam
[14:19.520 --> 14:22.320]  Uh, I just took them a whole stack last time I went so
[14:22.800 --> 14:25.600]  I grabbed I grabbed they have one out there. I forget what it is
[14:25.680 --> 14:30.240]  But it was all in dutch and i'm still trying to learn my dutch. So i'm like what what better subject material?
[14:30.880 --> 14:35.920]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And I mean we got to give it up to amsterdam too because uh,
[14:36.320 --> 14:42.320]  That was the original sort of mecca. That was the place where you would go to feel true cannabis freedom
[14:42.800 --> 14:47.760]  And then hopefully try to come home and create some of that back home. And now that we have
[14:48.240 --> 14:53.120]  Uh, you know the the beginnings of that happening all around the u.s. It's it's pretty amazing
[14:53.680 --> 14:59.600]  And I we still don't have you know, the coffee shop kind of vibe where you know, you can have that social use
[15:00.080 --> 15:01.040]  um
[15:01.040 --> 15:07.280]  That to me was something really really special about holland and also spain to a certain extent with the private clubs
[15:07.360 --> 15:08.400]  but in holland
[15:08.400 --> 15:12.000]  you know, they have the name on the door and the windows facing right out to the
[15:12.480 --> 15:15.200]  Street and you can sit and smoke a spliff and have a coffee
[15:15.600 --> 15:21.840]  And watch people ride by on their bikes and it's all it all felt so civilized, you know, yeah at a time for me
[15:22.240 --> 15:24.800]  uh as a youth in the 90s when
[15:25.280 --> 15:29.840]  You know back home you'd get thrown in jail immediately and over there you you felt this
[15:30.640 --> 15:31.920]  you know this
[15:31.920 --> 15:34.720]  Breath of fresh air of that cannabis was treated
[15:35.280 --> 15:40.640]  really the way it should be which is just as like a cup of coffee or a glass of wine or something it just
[15:41.280 --> 15:43.680]  Really, uh was an eye-opener and they
[15:44.380 --> 15:48.080]  Pioneered that a lot of expats that went over there and a lot of the dutch
[15:48.480 --> 15:50.480]  uh people as well, they really just
[15:51.040 --> 15:55.600]  Um, and that spread out from there and obviously the seed industry as well
[15:56.080 --> 16:02.960]  Had a tremendous amount to do with what I call basically overgrowing the government instead of overthrowing, you know
[16:02.960 --> 16:08.160]  Just creating so much cannabis that they they're forced to legalize because there's just no other option
[16:08.560 --> 16:10.960]  Yep, that's the thing overgrow grow your own
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.160]  Yeah, the social clubs are great and it sounds like new york kind of is a little bit closer
[16:16.160 --> 16:23.380]  I think nevada maybe or las vegas in particular may be going for it. Uh still still a long ways away in washington
[16:24.320 --> 16:28.100]  But it was it was nice. It was uh, you get together with like-minded individuals
[16:28.640 --> 16:32.960]  You may meet new people. It's a great conversation starter a joint and a coffee
[16:33.600 --> 16:40.400]  Absolutely, there's people from all over the world and you don't you don't even necessarily share language or culture with uh,
[16:40.480 --> 16:42.560]  And yet you have this, you know one
[16:43.200 --> 16:45.200]  you know sort of thing you can
[16:47.040 --> 16:49.040]  Share in common and then uh
[16:49.840 --> 16:52.640]  You know, it creates these friendships and and you know
[16:52.720 --> 16:55.680]  I think the internet as well had a tremendous amount to do
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.960]  with that a lot of the forums and things I see mag and overgrow and all these places where
[17:01.440 --> 17:06.960]  uh people could meet up and if they started to trust each other maybe share some genetics or spread
[17:07.440 --> 17:13.040]  Spread some of the love around and and so that people were able to have let's say sour diesel in you know
[17:13.760 --> 17:18.800]  spain, you know or whatever it might be like just that is so important that uh,
[17:19.360 --> 17:21.360]  that we're not just stuck with
[17:22.220 --> 17:25.920]  Polyhybrids and things that we only have in one in little area
[17:26.400 --> 17:34.000]  One of the tragedies of of the 70s and 80s, uh for cannabis was losing strains to history that gone forever
[17:34.080 --> 17:36.080]  you know and and I think uh,
[17:36.480 --> 17:41.600]  Hopefully that that's something of the past where now we can not only preserve
[17:42.080 --> 17:45.200]  Uh the genetics of the past but create something new as well
[17:45.680 --> 17:48.160]  um by breeding properly with
[17:49.120 --> 17:51.040]  you know different uh
[17:51.040 --> 17:53.040]  Land races and and all that
[17:53.680 --> 17:58.340]  It's nice to get the combination too I like kind of working with some of the traditional amsterdam
[17:58.700 --> 18:02.320]  genetics or dutch-based genetics with some of today's genetics just
[18:02.720 --> 18:08.800]  Trying to reintroduce a few things maybe find something that we're not seeing but right there are there's a lot of uh,
[18:09.040 --> 18:13.440]  Extra strains and extra work right and the import hash thing as well over there
[18:14.160 --> 18:18.320]  you know, we don't get to appreciate I mean we have our dabs and our solvent lists and our
[18:18.640 --> 18:21.280]  Our rosin and live resin and all these things here
[18:21.680 --> 18:24.180]  But we don't have you know, we don't have that traditional
[18:24.720 --> 18:26.800]  uh, you know moroccan or
[18:27.660 --> 18:29.180]  nepalese
[18:29.180 --> 18:30.560]  afghani
[18:30.560 --> 18:32.060]  just those
[18:32.060 --> 18:39.680]  Traditional hash making countries where these things have been passed down for thousands of years. I mean hashish is something that goes back
[18:40.240 --> 18:43.040]  uh, you know way way back and
[18:43.600 --> 18:50.320]  uh, really captures the the terroir the essence of the place where those strains are grown and and how those
[18:50.880 --> 18:54.960]  Uh trichomes are extracted and pressed and heated and so, you know
[18:54.960 --> 19:00.320]  that's something again that I miss, uh from going over to amsterdam being able to order hash off a menu and
[19:00.880 --> 19:02.480]  tasting the region
[19:02.480 --> 19:04.080]  Oh 100
[19:04.080 --> 19:07.120]  I'm, not much of a concentrate person here
[19:07.520 --> 19:13.120]  Um, I love my flower but yeah over there it was it was all about the hash and I would love to see
[19:13.680 --> 19:17.600]  You know the craft of that come back where again? We're sometimes. Um
[19:18.080 --> 19:24.240]  Driven by what's hot and you know perception. Uh, that's why we only want good apples in the grocery store
[19:24.800 --> 19:31.520]  but color seems to drive a lot of the concentrate market and this this hash is all brown and dark and
[19:32.400 --> 19:36.400]  Obviously, that's not that's passe or something. I don't know maybe over here
[19:36.480 --> 19:41.760]  but I mean, I think a true connoisseur appreciates all the variety and uh,
[19:42.160 --> 19:47.520]  You know, there's a time for some some beautiful moroccan or lebanese or you know?
[19:47.680 --> 19:50.320]  There's there's a time for every one of these. Uh
[19:50.960 --> 19:57.040]  Cannabis products and there's so much much variety. I mean just even now thinking back of edibles
[19:57.520 --> 20:01.840]  Uh to when we were younger if if you had a tray of pot brownies, that was your edibles
[20:01.920 --> 20:02.480]  That was it
[20:02.480 --> 20:07.920]  You know, there was not not a lot of options and now they can infuse any food or any drink
[20:08.320 --> 20:12.640]  you want and there's gummies you can take and you can regulate and micro dose and
[20:13.200 --> 20:18.480]  Uh, you know, I just think uh, there's so much we have to learn from this plant and so much uh
[20:19.120 --> 20:21.760]  still to learn from not just cannabis, but
[20:22.240 --> 20:23.440]  um
[20:23.440 --> 20:28.240]  uh plant medicines in general and psychedelic mushrooms and and uh
[20:29.360 --> 20:34.800]  all kinds of of plant medicines and they have a lot to teach us and we just need to
[20:35.760 --> 20:37.760]  be open to their
[20:38.480 --> 20:39.520]  Teachings
[20:39.520 --> 20:42.640]  The the endocannabinoid system is a great example of it
[20:42.720 --> 20:49.760]  You know, we really wouldn't have discovered that without you know, uh, michelome and thc and now cbd and that slowly followed
[20:50.000 --> 20:57.360]  We're finding out that works on many other functions in our body. So that's one argument. I usually use for people who are just completely
[20:57.900 --> 21:00.000]  anti-cannabis kevin sabbat, um
[21:00.720 --> 21:07.360]  Is you know if you don't have to take it, but if we find a pathway to cure something that may help your family member
[21:07.760 --> 21:12.400]  They could use a pharmaceutical. But if we find that pathway through cannabis, then you can't say cannabis is bad
[21:12.880 --> 21:13.600]  um
[21:13.600 --> 21:18.960]  There's plenty of yeah, there's there's plenty of good examples out there of people that this has helped. Um,
[21:19.760 --> 21:26.080]  Have you yeah, have you seen or any stick out in your head over your many years of covering this plant as a medicine?
[21:26.560 --> 21:28.880]  I I honestly i've met
[21:29.820 --> 21:35.760]  Thousands of people who have told me that cannabis has saved their life and i'm not I mean I have chills right now thinking
[21:35.760 --> 21:36.960]  About it. I've met
[21:37.360 --> 21:39.360]  veterans i've met people who were
[21:40.140 --> 21:45.760]  Alcoholics or addicted to hard drugs. I've met people who were at a suit who were suicidal
[21:46.320 --> 21:48.320]  uh who were at their wits end
[21:48.800 --> 21:53.280]  Uh with no solution and they decided why not give it a shot
[21:53.920 --> 21:57.600]  uh, and and and they will swear up and down
[21:58.320 --> 22:03.680]  And i'm talking many many people that cannabis saved their life. And I mean that's people who
[22:04.560 --> 22:09.280]  Weren't sick right they just that was just and and then i've met people who had cancer
[22:09.840 --> 22:11.840]  uh aids wasting syndrome
[22:12.640 --> 22:14.640]  all kinds of of medical
[22:14.800 --> 22:21.280]  um epilepsy and and and all kinds of medical issues who also said that it saved their life and
[22:21.520 --> 22:24.720]  The alternative is pills that destroy your liver
[22:25.360 --> 22:26.560]  um
[22:26.560 --> 22:28.720]  and and and much worse and so
[22:29.520 --> 22:32.240]  Uh, you know, that's really what drives me
[22:33.200 --> 22:37.200]  To sort of to proselytize about this plant because I do think
[22:37.760 --> 22:42.800]  Uh, it's a miracle plant. I think like the late great. Dr. Lester grinspoon said one day they're going to look back
[22:43.440 --> 22:45.680]  um and and and consider
[22:46.640 --> 22:52.480]  the the discovery of the medicinal uses of cannabis, uh akin to the discovery of
[22:53.200 --> 22:55.200]  uh
[22:55.840 --> 22:57.360]  Insulin or
[22:57.360 --> 22:59.360]  Yeah, all kinds of you know
[22:59.740 --> 23:01.440]  antibiotics, uh
[23:01.440 --> 23:04.560]  and things that actually saved many many lives and uh,
[23:05.120 --> 23:13.040]  You know, I just hope that we as a culture and a community can can accept what these plant medicines have to teach us
[23:13.600 --> 23:16.320]  um, they're here for a reason and uh
[23:16.960 --> 23:20.000]  You know, it's all about set and setting and and and all of that
[23:20.560 --> 23:23.280]  Uh, it's it's all well and good to enjoy yourself and have fun
[23:23.840 --> 23:28.320]  Cannabis is an enhancer it enlightens, you know, it enhances
[23:28.880 --> 23:30.880]  movies it enhances
[23:30.880 --> 23:32.880]  Uh love making it enhances
[23:33.680 --> 23:35.200]  a walk in the park
[23:35.200 --> 23:37.200]  uh, but it also treats
[23:37.840 --> 23:40.240]  uh illnesses and and symptoms
[23:40.880 --> 23:41.840]  of
[23:41.840 --> 23:44.400]  uh mental illnesses and all kinds of things so
[23:44.960 --> 23:51.600]  Uh, it really is a miracle plant and maybe it's not for everyone, you know, I do think that people, you know, there's people
[23:52.080 --> 24:00.240]  um that are schizophrenic or or other things where where they probably shouldn't be using psychedelics or cannabis medicines
[24:00.720 --> 24:05.680]  uh, but there's plenty more people out there that could benefit from it and I do think that uh,
[24:06.480 --> 24:11.300]  Um the lab testing and all these new new things that we're discovering
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  um with cannabis being
[24:14.240 --> 24:18.880]  more and more legal and you know the testing to be allowed and and now
[24:19.440 --> 24:22.720]  um people sort of uh using these things for
[24:23.520 --> 24:26.480]  uh therapies, you know, um, whether it be for
[24:27.120 --> 24:29.600]  couples therapy end of life therapy
[24:30.240 --> 24:32.880]  Uh post-traumatic stress. I mean everyone
[24:33.600 --> 24:36.880]  in in in the world has stress it's
[24:37.840 --> 24:42.880]  And it's the number one cause of all disease and if there's one thing, you know, you can say about cannabis it
[24:43.440 --> 24:45.440]  It helps with stress
[24:45.440 --> 24:46.720]  and so
[24:46.720 --> 24:51.120]  You know that there you have it and then there's always the jokes about munchies and you know
[24:51.120 --> 24:53.600]  Anytime anytime anyone who doesn't use cannabis
[24:54.080 --> 24:58.400]  You know has something to say about it or a headline and then in the news
[24:58.800 --> 25:02.560]  It's always some joke about doritos or munchies or it makes you hungry
[25:02.560 --> 25:09.120]  But that's that's also in in effect a life-saving thing if you have nausea if you can't eat
[25:09.520 --> 25:13.280]  uh, if you're suffering from those type of maladies, so
[25:13.920 --> 25:15.920]  Even the munchies is medicinal
[25:15.920 --> 25:18.560]  you know the thing that the thing that they joke about the most
[25:19.040 --> 25:22.720]  Is actually if you could come up with a pharmaceutical drug that could make people
[25:23.120 --> 25:25.920]  Hungry and at the same time a different variety that could make people
[25:26.400 --> 25:28.400]  Uh, you know suppress their appetite
[25:28.880 --> 25:30.880]  You'd be a billionaire
[25:31.440 --> 25:37.520]  And yet here we are, you know with this, uh the stigma on this wonderful, uh healing flower
[25:38.400 --> 25:41.920]  Yeah, and you know that is that's kind of the joke of the munchies but that's you know
[25:41.920 --> 25:44.980]  Like aids wasting syndrome is one of the original
[25:45.980 --> 25:49.520]  Prescribed reasons to get cannabis and they've tried it with maranol
[25:49.520 --> 25:53.280]  They've tried it with other synthetically derived things that just don't do the same thing
[25:53.680 --> 25:56.880]  The the whole plant medicine I think is you know, really where it's at too
[25:57.440 --> 26:01.780]  Yeah, and it was uh people from in in that community. That was the lgbtq
[26:02.960 --> 26:04.960]  uh community when aids
[26:05.520 --> 26:09.360]  Was killing, you know many many thousands of people and you had brownie mary
[26:10.080 --> 26:12.080]  in san francisco and dennis perrone
[26:13.120 --> 26:14.240]  these were
[26:14.240 --> 26:18.880]  the groundbreaking people who changed the laws and changed the perception and
[26:19.520 --> 26:22.100]  Created, you know what we know of as medical marijuana
[26:23.520 --> 26:26.160]  and yeah, we honor them and uh,
[26:26.720 --> 26:28.960]  continue the fight in their names because
[26:29.520 --> 26:35.140]  Uh, it really is just about the plant. We're all ambassadors. I I that's the way I feel it's not about individuals
[26:35.920 --> 26:40.320]  um, I obviously, you know, I you know, I honor them as individuals who
[26:40.960 --> 26:44.880]  Who were ambassadors for this plant and i'm honored to be an ambassador for this plant
[26:44.960 --> 26:48.080]  You're an ambassador for this plant and that's that's who we are. We
[26:48.800 --> 26:56.160]  We go out into the world and we try to teach people that there is alternatives and I I stress this highly if you if
[26:56.240 --> 27:02.320]  There's someone out there that's listening and they have a family member a friend a loved one who is suffering from
[27:03.100 --> 27:05.100]  alcoholism post-traumatic stress
[27:05.760 --> 27:08.080]  Uh any of these things that we've talked about?
[27:08.720 --> 27:10.240]  um
[27:10.240 --> 27:15.360]  Just ask them to try it if you give it a shot because it may not work for everyone
[27:15.440 --> 27:19.200]  But there's a lot of people out there who could benefit and aren't benefiting from it. So
[27:19.760 --> 27:26.000]  Um, and you don't have to smoke it, you know these days. Yes, that's so, you know, there's tinctures and edibles and
[27:26.700 --> 27:33.760]  topicals and there's all these different, uh ways of consumption and uh, and and you know, I think of people like that as
[27:34.480 --> 27:36.480]  uh cannabinoid deficient
[27:37.040 --> 27:42.800]  Do you know what I mean? They have deficiency in cannabinoids their endocannabinoid system is trying to
[27:43.360 --> 27:46.640]  Get cannabinoids and they're not getting them and that's where their
[27:47.280 --> 27:49.280]  uh illnesses are
[27:49.580 --> 27:50.800]  exacerbated
[27:50.800 --> 27:52.800]  and they're trying to treat with
[27:53.040 --> 27:56.560]  um, you know opioids or alcohol or
[27:57.120 --> 28:03.280]  All of these other things and and and those are poisons. Yeah, and and this plant has never killed anyone. So
[28:03.920 --> 28:07.360]  Uh, you can't certainly can't call it a poison. It's actually safer than sugar
[28:07.980 --> 28:09.200]  nicotine
[28:09.200 --> 28:10.480]  and uh
[28:10.480 --> 28:12.480]  You know even carbs
[28:12.800 --> 28:18.400]  Even carbs. Yes, and that's you know, i'm glad that you mentioned that there's other formats of it as someone who you know
[28:18.480 --> 28:19.840]  I primarily
[28:19.840 --> 28:21.360]  ingest by smoking
[28:21.360 --> 28:28.240]  Um, I I always forget that. Yeah, you absolutely don't have to smoke because there's people who absolutely will not smoke and I don't blame them
[28:28.480 --> 28:31.520]  So yeah, i'm glad that you mentioned that there were other methods
[28:31.920 --> 28:38.720]  uh, but I also want to mention too, um, you know, i've got i've got your book here the the this this is honestly
[28:39.200 --> 28:42.740]  The best book this is the number one book I recommend for anybody
[28:43.280 --> 28:45.600]  Who is interested in growing the way?
[28:46.080 --> 28:51.520]  I mean you you've had plenty of years to refine your take on. Oh, wow. I have a little leaf in here
[28:52.700 --> 28:55.200]  Interesting. That must have been my bookmark bookmark
[28:56.480 --> 28:58.320]  Yeah, the the
[28:58.320 --> 29:01.780]  The way you present the information and the order you present the information
[29:02.320 --> 29:06.160]  I I found is beneficial to people there's there's a lot you can
[29:06.700 --> 29:13.280]  Overcomplicate if you want to but you don't have to and that's something I appreciate about this book
[29:13.760 --> 29:14.880]  and
[29:14.880 --> 29:17.760]  I don't know if maybe you want to talk a little bit about it
[29:18.000 --> 29:23.120]  Maybe tell people some of the information that they could find in it because again anybody who?
[29:24.080 --> 29:28.320]  You know, we think has you know, this ptsd or may benefit through cannabis
[29:28.800 --> 29:34.240]  Um, you don't have to be a green thumb and just getting growing is a good way. So here here's your
[29:34.800 --> 29:38.640]  Here's your here's your gateway drug. No, it's a book. It's a book
[29:39.120 --> 29:42.800]  Yeah, you know I put it together because I wanted something really simple
[29:43.280 --> 29:50.400]  uh as sort of a gateway and an entry level, uh for people who who might be confused or
[29:51.420 --> 29:52.880]  intimidated because
[29:52.880 --> 29:54.080]  I learned from you know
[29:54.080 --> 30:00.240]  The great books of jorge cervantes and ed rosenthal and and bill drake and all of the writers that came before me
[30:00.640 --> 30:06.420]  Uh, but some of those books could be fairly daunting they were like textbooks, you know, and I felt like I was going to university
[30:07.120 --> 30:13.840]  uh reading them and so I wanted something to basically just be almost like a children's book but not not necessarily for kids, but
[30:14.800 --> 30:18.800]  But so that a grandma could get set up a tent and get her plants growing
[30:19.280 --> 30:25.520]  um, and so that anyone really could do that and so I really tried to just break it down into
[30:26.160 --> 30:33.520]  Uh simple things to understand if if you if you want to be self-sufficient, you know, you're going to need to have mother plants and and
[30:34.400 --> 30:39.440]  and then a flowering area a vegetating area and uh
[30:40.160 --> 30:44.560]  to understand cloning but to make it somewhat simple so that people could
[30:45.040 --> 30:48.240]  uh, basically for under let's say, you know,
[30:48.860 --> 30:51.360]  $1,500 or so maybe a thousand dollars if you got that
[30:51.920 --> 30:57.840]  Open space on your credit card and you can buy a tent and a light and some containers and some soil and
[30:58.480 --> 31:02.400]  Order some seeds or get some clones. You could get you can get growing today
[31:02.480 --> 31:07.220]  You know, that was the whole point of it. Uh, and then you're gonna obviously you're gonna need those textbooks
[31:07.840 --> 31:11.380]  Down the road as well. I mean, there's a lot to learn you're gonna make mistakes
[31:12.000 --> 31:13.760]  but there's no
[31:13.760 --> 31:18.720]  Way to do it without doing it. You actually have to plant a seed or grow a plant
[31:19.040 --> 31:21.040]  Uh in order to understand
[31:21.120 --> 31:27.200]  The life cycle the vegetative stage the flowering stage and what the needs are how to control the environment
[31:27.440 --> 31:31.760]  All of those are just things that you learn along the way dealing with pests dealing with mold. So
[31:32.320 --> 31:34.880]  uh, but I wanted to just get people in the door and
[31:35.680 --> 31:37.420]  the book came out in
[31:37.420 --> 31:38.480]  2018
[31:38.480 --> 31:43.440]  And it's been selling great. Uh, the pandemic certainly didn't hurt because I think a lot of people
[31:44.080 --> 31:46.800]  Uh decided, you know, they were going to spend a lot of time at home
[31:47.360 --> 31:50.320]  Uh, they might not have access to cannabis
[31:50.880 --> 31:55.520]  Uh, and they decided to grow their own and I don't blame them. I think it's wonderful
[31:55.920 --> 32:02.480]  I think it's a great way to know exactly what went into your plants and it's fun. I mean what other hobby
[32:03.440 --> 32:04.640]  out there
[32:04.640 --> 32:12.400]  Actually, you know feeds your soul in that way is that not only while you're growing but then even afterwards after you've dried and cured
[32:12.400 --> 32:13.520]  your flowers
[32:13.520 --> 32:18.000]  Uh that you can consume them and know like hey I created this and here it is like
[32:18.800 --> 32:21.120]  Helping me back. It's it's just a
[32:21.760 --> 32:24.480]  You know to me. I I felt like it was modern day alchemy
[32:25.760 --> 32:28.640]  turning light air food and water into
[32:29.440 --> 32:33.360]  Literally gold something more than worth its weight in gold in my opinion
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.600]  and uh
[32:35.600 --> 32:41.440]  And if you do it, right, man, there's nothing like it and uh, you know the the essential oils
[32:42.080 --> 32:49.040]  Uh the fact that you can then use your trim to make edibles or tinctures or topicals and you know
[32:49.600 --> 32:51.600]  None of the plant goes to waste
[32:51.600 --> 32:57.200]  And and then you've got other plants to grow for the next uh round and you can even give it away for free
[32:57.760 --> 33:01.760]  You know, that's the other part. That's so much fun is giving away free weed
[33:01.760 --> 33:06.640]  That's my first podcast was called free weed for that reason because I felt like there's you know
[33:06.640 --> 33:11.520]  There's no reason you can't just give this stuff away if you have more than you can consume yourself
[33:12.000 --> 33:14.320]  And you know, there's a whole other round coming down the road
[33:16.400 --> 33:19.520]  I I actually have this sitting right here. Oh, that's awesome
[33:20.400 --> 33:22.400]  There we go
[33:22.400 --> 33:29.120]  There it is free weed. I started that in 2011. I was just getting interested in in podcasts, you know, I was listening to
[33:29.840 --> 33:30.720]  um
[33:30.720 --> 33:35.760]  Mark, marin and a few of the other podcasts that were out there and I was like this is a great medium
[33:35.920 --> 33:37.200]  It's free
[33:37.200 --> 33:41.760]  And again, you charge the advertisers but you but but people can listen to this for free
[33:42.320 --> 33:44.320]  And you can inspire them
[33:44.800 --> 33:48.560]  to potentially grow their own cannabis and I do think uh,
[33:49.200 --> 33:53.600]  You know over the years, I you know, I I think that that's that's been
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.320]  Uh, one of the great pleasures of my life has been a couple of hundred episodes that between free weed and grow bud yourself
[34:00.320 --> 34:02.000]  Which is the one I do now
[34:02.000 --> 34:03.360]  um
[34:03.360 --> 34:11.120]  just you know inspiring people interviewing breeders interviewing, uh, phd people people who
[34:11.680 --> 34:12.720]  um
[34:12.720 --> 34:18.560]  I've been growing for many many years people who grow on a large scale small scale all of it and just to learn
[34:18.960 --> 34:26.720]  uh hash makers extract artists all of it like to me it's uh, it's been a honor and a pleasure to
[34:27.360 --> 34:33.280]  Spread the word it's been it's been a fun journey to kind of follow along and you know to real quickly touch again
[34:33.360 --> 34:39.520]  On the book the book has everything you need to know to get to a successful harvest like you're going to learn
[34:40.000 --> 34:46.400]  everything you need for success and then if you want to continue on definitely can but the most important thing is
[34:46.960 --> 34:51.680]  Getting to harvest for people, you know, that's it's again the medicine being able to rely
[34:52.220 --> 34:56.160]  Reliably reliably. Yeah, that's the word. Um, repeat it
[34:56.560 --> 35:02.640]  Uh, and this you know that has everything in there and to the podcast the original podcast the free weed
[35:02.880 --> 35:05.280]  um, I remember I was working a
[35:06.080 --> 35:11.120]  Different job in those days. I was still in my music career and I would wait every I forget if it was like
[35:11.120 --> 35:16.160]  Wednesday or thursday would come out, but i'd always refresh i'd always be refreshing all day long waiting for the new episode
[35:16.800 --> 35:21.440]  It took you guys a while to get to a hundred but this new podcast the grow bud yourself
[35:21.520 --> 35:26.960]  You guys are bang bang bang like every week with that. Yeah. Yeah, you know, we just uh, uh,
[35:27.360 --> 35:30.960]  It it in those free weed days. It was kind of something we did on the side
[35:31.360 --> 35:35.200]  Uh along with working at high times and putting out that magazine
[35:35.760 --> 35:40.080]  um doing all the cannabis cup events and things so, you know, there was
[35:40.720 --> 35:44.080]  If we put one out every two or three weeks, we were happy
[35:44.560 --> 35:48.000]  Uh, because it was kind of extra for us. It was just a labor of love
[35:48.640 --> 35:52.180]  But now with grow by yourself, we've been doing it since 2020
[35:52.800 --> 35:56.960]  uh, we're about to reach our hundredth episode, which i'm excited about and
[35:57.120 --> 35:58.160]  Uh
[35:58.160 --> 36:01.520]  You know, yeah same thing. We just we try to put it out every week
[36:01.600 --> 36:06.480]  You know, if someone takes a vacation, we might skip a week here and there but for the most part. It's a weekly show
[36:07.040 --> 36:07.840]  um
[36:07.840 --> 36:10.720]  We've got our strain of the fortnight where we talk about a strain
[36:11.120 --> 36:16.800]  Uh, we take listener questions from from our our listeners and try to answer their real questions
[36:17.360 --> 36:21.120]  uh, we feature someone as a guest almost every episode that
[36:21.920 --> 36:24.400]  Some of them who have passed that i'm just so proud
[36:24.800 --> 36:29.600]  uh having interviewed them and spoken to them and and gotten a little bit of you know, their
[36:30.160 --> 36:34.480]  Um origin stories as well in some cases maybe that have never been told
[36:35.040 --> 36:37.040]  uh, so yeah, it's just uh
[36:37.520 --> 36:39.760]  It's been fun. I love I love doing the podcast
[36:39.760 --> 36:46.400]  I love doing the magazine and and the book as well and and any events that um, I get to be a part of the freedom rally
[36:46.960 --> 36:48.160]  um
[36:48.160 --> 36:49.680]  any of these uh
[36:49.680 --> 36:53.040]  Cups and things that i've gotten to judge. I think i've probably judged more
[36:53.680 --> 36:56.560]  Uh cannabis events than anyone else on earth, uh
[36:57.840 --> 37:01.360]  You know over the years and and it's it's a pleasure. It's it's hard work
[37:01.520 --> 37:06.960]  You know people don't want to don't want to hear that but you know, you don't always take notes on every joint you smoke
[37:08.400 --> 37:11.600]  Has that has that spoiled you though? I mean seriously
[37:12.240 --> 37:16.160]  I don't think so. I mean I i'll let you know when I get bored of cannabis
[37:17.040 --> 37:18.080]  You know
[37:18.080 --> 37:24.480]  There's always some a new strain there's always a new flavor and there's always the go-tos that I love, uh, you know
[37:25.120 --> 37:29.920]  to revisit time and time again, uh, and I do think that you know, that's the beauty
[37:30.400 --> 37:35.120]  Of the time that we're living in there's never been more cannabis growing on this planet than there is right now
[37:35.600 --> 37:38.880]  Uh, and yes, it's not all grade a quality
[37:38.960 --> 37:42.400]  Some of it's going to get blasted into vape pens and whatnot
[37:42.400 --> 37:48.720]  But but it's a it's a wonderful time to be alive and and there's more new strains out there
[37:49.120 --> 37:51.600]  Uh, if people are popping seeds every time
[37:52.240 --> 37:53.760]  You pop a seed
[37:53.760 --> 37:55.840]  The potential is there for something brand new?
[37:56.400 --> 37:57.680]  uh, so
[37:57.680 --> 38:03.920]  I do think that uh, you know, we're in an exciting time and there's all these different different terpene profiles and we're learning
[38:04.320 --> 38:07.360]  all about how those terpenes in conjunction with
[38:07.900 --> 38:11.220]  THC CBD and cbg and all the other cannabinoids
[38:11.840 --> 38:15.220]  Uh flavonoids how they work together to create
[38:15.780 --> 38:17.780]  a flavor and an effect
[38:18.340 --> 38:19.300]  and
[38:19.300 --> 38:22.980]  Uh, and that uniqueness of it. I think you know, there's just so much
[38:23.700 --> 38:25.700]  yet to learn and uh
[38:26.260 --> 38:28.260]  I yeah
[38:28.420 --> 38:31.300]  I love it. I love the plant and I love talking about it and
[38:31.940 --> 38:34.420]  And proselytizing I guess about it
[38:34.980 --> 38:40.100]  Well, that's the fun thing about gardening, you know, that's why uh, i'm audio engineer by trade. That's my background
[38:40.580 --> 38:44.660]  Um, you know gardening and music you're never gonna know it all and that's part of the fun
[38:44.820 --> 38:50.340]  You know is is you can always continue to progress right and lately, you know, i've been i've been learning about uh,
[38:50.420 --> 38:52.420]  Poker strategy and that sort of thing
[38:53.140 --> 38:55.860]  Yeah, and you know, i'm obviously an amateur at all of that
[38:56.740 --> 38:59.480]  But but it's but what it is is it's all situational
[39:00.180 --> 39:04.020]  right, so it's it's it's actually kind of difficult to teach because
[39:04.980 --> 39:09.860]  It's so situational. I mean if you're in arizona and you're dealing with 100 plus degree temperatures
[39:10.260 --> 39:17.620]  It's a whole different ball game than if you're in northern california or washington or colorado or nepal or wherever you might be
[39:17.700 --> 39:21.060]  It's altitude temperature, you know controlling
[39:21.620 --> 39:24.740]  um environment there's so many factors and
[39:25.300 --> 39:30.180]  Um, it's really situational. Are you at the you know on the button? Are you the dealer?
[39:30.260 --> 39:34.340]  Are you the big blind or the small blind? You know how much money's in the pot?
[39:34.820 --> 39:41.800]  Those are the situational aspects of poker strategy and I think growing strategy is the same it's it's actually quite situational
[39:42.500 --> 39:48.820]  and um, some people might need dehumidifiers whereas another person needs 10 humidifiers, so
[39:49.380 --> 39:55.300]  Uh, you know that's been humbling as well sort of learning that there isn't one perfect way
[39:55.860 --> 40:00.820]  um, there's many different ways and they're all they're all based on what you're looking for and
[40:01.620 --> 40:05.700]  What you're dealing with as far as the environment and your location
[40:06.820 --> 40:13.460]  Well said I always like to hear people with experience say that there's more than one right way because there there really is
[40:13.700 --> 40:19.860]  um, so i'm glad that you said that and and you talk about all of that on the podcast too and
[40:20.100 --> 40:23.700]  You know, i'm just thinking back. I I don't even know seven eight years ago now
[40:24.100 --> 40:28.020]  Um, you were answering my questions, uh in the in the viewer question section
[40:28.340 --> 40:32.500]  And that's something that I want to put out to people that the accessibility is there
[40:32.660 --> 40:39.060]  Um, you know if you are listening to these shows and you have questions, um, definitely send them an email. Um,
[40:39.620 --> 40:46.340]  You you'd be surprised. Um, that's an awesome opportunity if you've ever wanted to get some of your questions answered or looked at
[40:47.140 --> 40:51.860]  Hit them up. Yeah. Yeah. I'm on twitter instagram facebook. We have all of those for
[40:52.660 --> 40:54.660]  northeast leaf and growbud yourself
[40:55.140 --> 40:58.660]  Um, so if people have questions, yeah indeed hit us up
[40:59.140 --> 41:02.020]  Um, you know, it may take a week or two to get your answer
[41:02.500 --> 41:04.660]  uh, maybe you know a month I don't know but
[41:05.140 --> 41:09.780]  uh, we will get it out there and you know, you can listen to other people's questions too and
[41:11.940 --> 41:15.060]  Not only is growing situational but it's also you have to
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.620]  anticipate
[41:17.620 --> 41:20.740]  The future, you know, you have to be prepared for harvest time
[41:20.740 --> 41:28.500]  You have to be prepared for flowering time be prepared for planting time. All of it is about preparation taking notes and making sure
[41:29.060 --> 41:31.700]  um, you learn from your mistakes and that you're also
[41:32.640 --> 41:35.460]  Anticipating so, you know people talk about dealing with
[41:36.100 --> 41:37.780]  pest problems
[41:37.780 --> 41:39.860]  The best way to deal with it is prevention
[41:40.660 --> 41:46.020]  You know, the second best way is constantly checking all of the surfaces and all of that
[41:46.420 --> 41:51.780]  The worst way is just to let a problem become a bigger problem and then have to deal with you know
[41:52.820 --> 41:56.660]  Webbing from spider mites when you could have stopped them early
[41:56.660 --> 42:01.060]  But you didn't notice or you went away for a long weekend or whatever it might be
[42:01.620 --> 42:05.640]  And it became a such a bigger problem. And so you have to anticipate
[42:06.580 --> 42:09.780]  uh, you know future problems and you have to sort of
[42:10.660 --> 42:18.980]  Act accordingly, you know work to prevent those problems from occurring rather than constantly being defensive against issues that have already occurred
[42:19.540 --> 42:25.780]  Yeah, proactive is your best bet if you already have them. Um, you're already behind the curve. So yeah
[42:25.940 --> 42:30.820]  I I immediately grabbed my lighter when you said webbing. I'm just like burn it all burn it down
[42:31.460 --> 42:38.020]  Yeah, I mean I get some wild questions where people are like, you know, I have webbing all over my flowers
[42:38.180 --> 42:39.940]  What do I do i'm like
[42:39.940 --> 42:41.940]  You know burn everything down
[42:42.100 --> 42:48.340]  I have this start over kind of tricone. It looks like little hairs growing on the leaves. Is this a new street? Yeah
[42:49.460 --> 42:51.940]  I've got powdery mildew. I've got this i've got that
[42:52.500 --> 42:57.620]  You know, these are problems you anticipate and deal with as quickly as possible, you know, I mean that's
[42:58.180 --> 43:04.180]  that's the other thing and then there's times where you just sit back and let things go because you got to let the plant do
[43:04.180 --> 43:11.540]  Its thing and i've seen people with issues of over watering or over feeding over feeding is actually my biggest pet
[43:11.540 --> 43:16.020]  Beave I think to be honest, uh is those burnt leaf tips that people get from
[43:16.640 --> 43:22.660]  Constantly feeding their plants because they think more food bigger plants and that's just not the case. You have to feed the plant
[43:23.200 --> 43:29.460]  Properly what it needs to convert the light into energy and all of that. It's it's a it's a whole process
[43:29.540 --> 43:30.820]  So there it's
[43:30.820 --> 43:36.340]  you know chains in that cuban link and each chain has to be perfect and and uh,
[43:36.980 --> 43:40.180]  But the overfeeding is I think it's a really big issue
[43:40.580 --> 43:47.620]  um, the nutrient companies will certainly recommend more than necessary because they want you to finish that nutrient bottle buy a new one and
[43:47.860 --> 43:49.860]  they know it's not going to kill your plant, but
[43:49.860 --> 43:52.180]  uh, it might you know kill your buzz a little so
[43:52.980 --> 43:54.900]  feed lightly, you know start with
[43:54.900 --> 43:59.380]  You know quarter to half of what's recommended and bump it up if you need to you can always add more
[43:59.700 --> 44:01.700]  It's really difficult to take
[44:01.700 --> 44:03.700]  away, you know
[44:04.180 --> 44:07.620]  And flush everything all out and then start over with mile, you know
[44:07.620 --> 44:15.060]  That's that's like going nuclear when it comes to plant feeding and feeding lightly sometimes just give your plant plant plain water
[44:15.460 --> 44:17.140]  That's okay, you know
[44:17.140 --> 44:22.580]  Sometimes you know, there's plenty of nutrients built up in your growing medium that need to be used up
[44:22.660 --> 44:25.540]  So, you know just don't overdo things and
[44:26.900 --> 44:28.900]  It's like vitamins, you know, you can take that
[44:30.080 --> 44:34.420]  5,000 daily dose of vitamin c but your body's only taking a hundred of it
[44:35.140 --> 44:36.500]  That's all it needs
[44:36.500 --> 44:42.900]  right, and if you I mean it all boils down to if you want your actual bud to burn properly and and to
[44:43.300 --> 44:45.860]  taste properly and those essential oils to be
[44:46.420 --> 44:48.080]  um well
[44:48.080 --> 44:49.060]  represented
[44:49.060 --> 44:54.900]  Um, that's that comes down to feeding lightly and then you know doing a decent enough flush
[44:55.460 --> 44:59.540]  Uh, but if you overfeed for you know, 15 weeks and then flush for two weeks
[45:00.180 --> 45:01.540]  It's not gonna cut it
[45:01.540 --> 45:05.460]  you know, you gotta gotta feed lightly and and flush properly and
[45:05.940 --> 45:09.700]  And then you get a really a connoisseur quality grade a product
[45:10.180 --> 45:13.620]  And that's what we're all after at the end of the day. That's what we're after
[45:14.340 --> 45:18.340]  Um now I wanted to ask you this too now i've again
[45:18.900 --> 45:24.340]  The accessibility is great. I've asked you this in private for you know, just kind of some advice on writing. Um,
[45:24.820 --> 45:26.100]  but you've been
[45:26.100 --> 45:28.100]  in this industry for
[45:28.100 --> 45:29.380]  many years
[45:29.380 --> 45:30.420]  um
[45:30.420 --> 45:33.540]  Without necessarily having a plant touching
[45:34.260 --> 45:36.260]  position or role
[45:36.900 --> 45:41.540]  There's a lot of people out here who would like to get into the cannabis industry that may not be able to
[45:42.100 --> 45:45.140]  Have a license or worked at a licensed grow
[45:46.020 --> 45:51.620]  What are some of the maybe alternative areas that you have seen develop over the years whether it be like?
[45:52.180 --> 45:54.360]  the vendor of certain accessories
[45:55.140 --> 45:56.880]  or you know
[45:56.880 --> 46:04.420]  Podcasting what are maybe some of the other avenues that might be worth pursuing for people who can't get a plant touching job?
[46:05.540 --> 46:10.740]  Right. Um, I mean if if you're interested in a plant touching job, you can't you don't really start at the top
[46:10.900 --> 46:14.340]  You know, you typically have to get in there work as a trimmer
[46:14.900 --> 46:16.900]  um, you know work
[46:16.900 --> 46:22.420]  You know as a sweep in the floor, whatever it might be get your foot in the door and work hard show up on time
[46:22.820 --> 46:25.700]  And you'll see very quickly and you'll learn very quickly
[46:26.100 --> 46:29.780]  uh, but as far as other gigs, there's there's a you know a whole
[46:30.420 --> 46:31.780]  world of
[46:31.780 --> 46:33.140]  uh publishing
[46:33.140 --> 46:40.020]  Uh, whether it be leaf magazines, there's you know weed maps and leafly and all these other brands out there these days
[46:40.420 --> 46:42.420]  a lot of internet
[46:42.900 --> 46:44.660]  Companies as well
[46:44.660 --> 46:46.340]  There's a lot of different
[46:46.340 --> 46:48.340]  uh brands that need
[46:48.740 --> 46:50.740]  all different types of of
[46:50.880 --> 46:53.560]  services marketing legal services
[46:54.180 --> 47:00.100]  Um so many different ancillary ways that you can get your foot into the door of the industry
[47:00.660 --> 47:01.620]  uh
[47:01.620 --> 47:06.500]  You know and and people are constantly hiring. I mean now there's like websites and all kinds of places
[47:06.900 --> 47:11.460]  Um linkedin is a place where there's a lot of canna businesses, um searching for
[47:12.180 --> 47:13.540]  uh for help
[47:13.540 --> 47:14.420]  uh
[47:14.420 --> 47:18.420]  But you know, there's there's so many different ways. I mean the last I heard there was
[47:18.820 --> 47:24.900]  Um something like three three to four hundred thousand jobs in the legal cannabis industry in america
[47:25.380 --> 47:27.380]  uh, and I think
[47:27.620 --> 47:30.340]  Uh, many of those are not plant touching
[47:30.980 --> 47:32.580]  uh jobs
[47:32.580 --> 47:35.060]  But you know if if you can touch the plant
[47:36.020 --> 47:42.180]  It always helps, you know, I think it helps and and it helps to be a true believer. I mean you got it's this isn't
[47:42.720 --> 47:47.700]  Widgets, this isn't cell phones, you know, this isn't just another product. It's something
[47:48.340 --> 47:54.340]  where uh, if you want to really thrive, uh, you have to really believe and love
[47:54.980 --> 48:00.580]  uh, all of the different aspects of the plant whether you know, and then there's cbd businesses and there's
[48:01.220 --> 48:04.580]  Um edibles and all these different ways to get involved
[48:05.060 --> 48:09.860]  um, but if you live in a state where it's legal, I mean, it's definitely better than
[48:10.500 --> 48:14.020]  Uh, you know like a food service type job or any kind of entry-level
[48:14.660 --> 48:16.660]  um minimum wage gig
[48:17.140 --> 48:19.140]  Uh, because like I said if you work hard
[48:19.700 --> 48:24.020]  Uh show up on time and learn from the people around you
[48:24.500 --> 48:26.500]  Uh, you'll work your way up pretty quickly
[48:26.900 --> 48:30.980]  Uh, and if you are the true believer, I think that's recognized by
[48:32.020 --> 48:34.180]  management and people in the companies and
[48:34.900 --> 48:36.820]  You know, it's a great industry
[48:36.820 --> 48:40.020]  but I also tell people if you don't want to be part of the industry, you can always just
[48:40.740 --> 48:43.780]  Put up a tent grow your own and do your own thing. So
[48:44.500 --> 48:48.100]  You know people that are complaining about corporate cannabis and all of that. It's like
[48:48.580 --> 48:54.360]  Hey, there's no reason you have to participate in this. There are there are other options and opportunities
[48:55.160 --> 48:57.160]  Uh, even within cannabis
[48:57.800 --> 49:04.120]  Well, and thank you. That was an excellent answer. Um to give a lot of people options, uh, absolutely correct
[49:04.200 --> 49:10.760]  I've done the commercial grow as well and it was you know, I I came in with my you know, my my fancy little degree
[49:10.840 --> 49:12.040]  and there's
[49:12.040 --> 49:18.600]  That doesn't even matter man. Um, you start at the bottom you work hard and you get promoted and that was definitely the experience there
[49:19.860 --> 49:21.460]  surprisingly
[49:21.460 --> 49:25.460]  Employees almost seem like a dime a dozen and then they get that we used to joke
[49:25.540 --> 49:29.460]  There was like a three-day curve if you if you don't quit within the first three days
[49:29.540 --> 49:36.100]  You'll probably last at least the first month some people seriously expect like volleyball and like bongs on lunch break
[49:37.220 --> 49:41.540]  Yeah, you know I used to get that a lot when you know being at high times when that was one of the few
[49:42.320 --> 49:47.220]  Legitimate gigs and cannabis people would just ask you like do you all is all you do smoke weed all day? It's like
[49:48.180 --> 49:49.940]  No
[49:49.940 --> 49:56.500]  We have a job like a magazine has to come out calendars web website articles books, you know
[49:56.580 --> 50:02.420]  there's constantly things to do now you can do those things and you can consume cannabis, that's great, but that's
[50:03.140 --> 50:05.620]  You know, the consumption is secondary to the job
[50:06.180 --> 50:11.620]  Uh, and you really got to you got to put you know, put your nose to the grindstone and do the work
[50:12.180 --> 50:17.300]  Uh, and you can celebrate and have fun. I mean, that's the other thing is we have a lot of fun in this industry
[50:17.860 --> 50:19.860]  Um, but you got to do the work
[50:20.100 --> 50:26.260]  Um, so, you know, that was kind of the lesson there. It's like no we can't we don't just sit around and smoke all day
[50:26.260 --> 50:28.260]  I mean there's days
[50:28.260 --> 50:30.660]  You know, I know about your edible fridays, right?
[50:31.300 --> 50:37.460]  Yeah, space gate fridays we used to have but uh, but the job had to get done and you know, you only get away
[50:38.180 --> 50:44.020]  with the fun, uh after the job is done basically or or during but at least
[50:44.500 --> 50:49.060]  Uh, you have to work and that's that's why I said you got to show up on time
[50:49.140 --> 50:55.700]  I hear from people all the time that they hire people and the people show up late. They take two hour lunches
[50:55.780 --> 51:02.100]  They leave early. They're all constantly taking days off. So they're like, you know, I only hire, you know veterans at this point
[51:02.100 --> 51:04.340]  Or you know people who just understand, you know
[51:04.900 --> 51:06.660]  On time is late
[51:06.660 --> 51:08.340]  Early is on time
[51:08.340 --> 51:13.620]  Work all day then have fun, you know get the job done and and that
[51:14.180 --> 51:18.180]  uh work ethic will take you a really long way in this industry because
[51:18.740 --> 51:22.340]  everyone you're competing against is is probably just thinking I can
[51:23.060 --> 51:25.140]  you know have fun and and and
[51:25.620 --> 51:28.980]  Um, you know dick around and not actually do the job, right?
[51:29.220 --> 51:32.500]  But the job has to get done and that's that's why I used to think you know
[51:32.820 --> 51:37.220]  of people as like productive pot people like you know, you know, the
[51:38.180 --> 51:43.300]  You can't use cannabis as an excuse to be lazy, you know plenty of lazy people smoke cannabis
[51:43.780 --> 51:47.140]  uh, but plenty of hard-working people do too and
[51:48.100 --> 51:52.280]  The stereotype is not the reality but don't be the stereotype
[51:53.060 --> 51:58.500]  Yes, and that always drove me honestly to be more productive is I didn't want to be that stereotype because I love
[51:58.740 --> 52:02.420]  I love cannabis so much and I smoke it constantly. So i'm like well, okay
[52:02.500 --> 52:05.700]  I can't I can't be that person if i'm gonna be all about it. So
[52:06.180 --> 52:10.180]  Yeah, but there's nothing to stop you from working cannabis does not make you lazy
[52:10.500 --> 52:14.180]  I mean it certainly makes you not want to do things. You don't feel like doing
[52:14.740 --> 52:18.180]  But if you're working in the cannabis industry, these are things you should want to do
[52:18.740 --> 52:22.500]  and uh, yeah, or whatever industry to be honest, I mean, I just think
[52:23.060 --> 52:29.940]  uh, you know, that's another one of those uh stigmas that we can get way far beyond now that there's
[52:30.500 --> 52:33.780]  uh phds and doctors and lawyers and all the you know people
[52:34.500 --> 52:40.420]  That all consume cannabis, uh safely and effectively and continue to do their jobs
[52:41.220 --> 52:43.720]  um, you know and then dr. Grinspoon
[52:44.500 --> 52:47.300]  Was kind of a a hallmark in that
[52:47.860 --> 52:49.540]  or a bellwether
[52:49.540 --> 52:54.600]  Guiding light. He was an original when it came to that type of stuff. He lent a lot of credibility
[52:55.220 --> 52:56.740]  uh in
[52:56.740 --> 52:58.740]  To what he did. Um
[52:59.300 --> 53:03.700]  Do you have any uh exciting stories or not exciting i'm running out of words here but uh
[53:04.340 --> 53:07.140]  stories of conversations with him maybe uh
[53:07.620 --> 53:11.300]  Where he kind of was preaching the importance to you to pass on to others
[53:12.100 --> 53:18.580]  Yeah, I mean I was definitely lucky enough to spend a good amount of time with dr. Lester Grinspoon his wife betsy
[53:19.140 --> 53:21.140]  uh his sons as well
[53:22.100 --> 53:23.460]  and
[53:23.460 --> 53:26.580]  Yeah, he he was a very very intelligent
[53:26.980 --> 53:29.220]  Uh, man, he really uh
[53:30.580 --> 53:35.460]  He and he he had been converted to cannabis by carl sagan his friend
[53:35.860 --> 53:37.860]  Um, who was a cannabis user?
[53:38.020 --> 53:44.020]  Uh, and and so the stories that he told about carl and him they smoked cannabis in
[53:44.500 --> 53:49.140]  The soviet union, uh in like the 80s carl carl was invited
[53:49.700 --> 53:51.700]  uh to some uh, you know
[53:52.580 --> 53:54.580]  global conference on on
[53:54.660 --> 54:02.260]  Uh the cosmos or something like that and brought the grinspoons over and they actually smoked cannabis in red square of moscow
[54:02.660 --> 54:05.300]  on the balcony of their hotel in like the 80s
[54:05.860 --> 54:07.620]  and
[54:07.620 --> 54:12.820]  So that's that's an amazing story but but uh, you know, he told stories about he he
[54:13.460 --> 54:15.460]  Was part of john lennon's defense
[54:15.700 --> 54:21.060]  Uh about when john lennon was being deported by nixon, uh for an old, uh hash
[54:21.700 --> 54:27.220]  A bust in in england, you know nixon was just you know, he was like the trump before trump, you know
[54:27.220 --> 54:31.060]  He was like he had his enemies list and he was trying to get rid of john lennon
[54:31.620 --> 54:36.260]  and uh lester testified on behalf of john lennon and
[54:36.740 --> 54:42.420]  met john and yoko and got to sort of experience what that beetle mania was like when they got out of the uh,
[54:43.380 --> 54:49.060]  The courtroom and people just descended on them and there was thousands and thousands of beetle maniacs out there
[54:50.020 --> 54:51.940]  Um, but really his
[54:51.940 --> 54:53.940]  one of his contributions obviously
[54:54.580 --> 55:02.740]  Major contribution was to medical marijuana. Um the book marijuana the forbidden medicine, but even later I think he came around to
[55:03.940 --> 55:11.140]  Just marijuana as an enhancement. I mentioned this earlier, but just something that just actually improves the quality of
[55:12.340 --> 55:13.700]  uh
[55:13.700 --> 55:20.420]  a walk in the park, you know, and uh, and that to me is so profound because
[55:21.300 --> 55:25.300]  That's medical too that improves it improves your your your
[55:26.020 --> 55:27.460]  level of joy
[55:27.460 --> 55:29.460]  And even if you're not sick
[55:29.460 --> 55:31.460]  Uh, it helps ward off
[55:31.860 --> 55:38.900]  Uh negativity and bad vibes and and and stress and that's medicinal too. So to me
[55:39.700 --> 55:44.580]  Um, the enhancement qualities of cannabis is very important and and so
[55:45.140 --> 55:48.580]  you know if you're going to see a movie or you're going to uh,
[55:49.140 --> 55:53.140]  Enjoy a symphony orchestra or a rock show or whatever it might be
[55:53.700 --> 55:57.060]  Uh cannabis will enhance it whereas something like alcohol
[55:57.780 --> 56:03.300]  Uh hard drugs will actually dull it and make it harder to remember harder to enjoy
[56:03.940 --> 56:10.260]  Um where cannabis really does enhance it and I think that's such an important aspect of this plant
[56:11.860 --> 56:17.220]  That sort of gets sometimes left behind, uh in the in the whole medical
[56:18.160 --> 56:19.540]  conversation
[56:19.540 --> 56:23.220]  Yeah, mental health is something we don't really like talking about in this country
[56:24.160 --> 56:30.740]  Unfortunately, right but it's preventative just like I was saying with everything, you know with growing, you know, it prevents
[56:31.300 --> 56:37.480]  Problems before they arise, you know, and your endocannabinoid system needs cannabinoids
[56:37.540 --> 56:40.900]  That's what it's you know all the way back to breast milk
[56:41.140 --> 56:46.820]  Um, you know really goes back to the first moments of your life when you you know latch on
[56:47.300 --> 56:48.900]  uh to your mother
[56:48.900 --> 56:54.740]  Uh, there's cannabinoids in breast milk, you know, that's and those are the first moments of your life, you know, so
[56:55.380 --> 56:57.140]  I do think that uh
[56:57.140 --> 57:02.260]  There's a lot of cannabinoid deficient people out there that could could benefit and I think there's a lot of people
[57:02.960 --> 57:04.960]  suffering from
[57:05.040 --> 57:07.040]  addictions and from
[57:07.380 --> 57:10.260]  mental illness and from stress and from
[57:10.900 --> 57:12.900]  Trauma and unresolved grief
[57:13.540 --> 57:15.540]  And things that they're trying to numb
[57:16.340 --> 57:18.340]  Cannabis doesn't numb those things
[57:18.880 --> 57:20.880]  cannabis
[57:21.460 --> 57:23.300]  Prevents you from
[57:23.360 --> 57:28.820]  Succumbing to that numbness, you know, it's a it's different. It's not the same thing as
[57:29.860 --> 57:31.860]  Numbing it's enhancing
[57:32.180 --> 57:37.540]  And I think a lot of people could really benefit from that many many many people especially now
[57:39.380 --> 57:41.940]  Yeah, well well said I was
[57:42.980 --> 57:48.980]  Uh, yeah that the whole the whole mental health thing is is a subject I always like talking about and as you said, you know
[57:48.980 --> 57:54.100]  If it enhances your perspective of walking through the park, the leaves are a little bit greener, you know
[57:54.100 --> 57:58.340]  That releases a little serotonin in your head things are starting to look the right way
[57:58.900 --> 58:05.560]  Um, and that's you know, sometimes the the argument for people who's like it's not medicinal or I don't use it medicinally
[58:06.180 --> 58:07.460]  um
[58:07.460 --> 58:12.660]  You know, sometimes it can make kind of a rude person a little bit nicer. So I think that's medicinal too
[58:13.380 --> 58:15.540]  Uh, and then I you know, I wanted to ask
[58:16.260 --> 58:21.300]  You know kind of what is cannabis to you, but I really think anybody who's watched this episode
[58:22.020 --> 58:25.940]  can kind of see um exactly, you know what it means to you it
[58:26.820 --> 58:32.740]  I don't know to me and i'll let you answer too. But to me it seems so much bigger than just
[58:33.860 --> 58:35.860]  what it is there's
[58:35.920 --> 58:41.300]  Unlimited potential of this plant and we said earlier, you know, we compared it to like antibiotics or things
[58:41.620 --> 58:48.340]  There haven't been that many like oh my gosh medical moments in the last 50 60 70 almost 100 years
[58:48.580 --> 58:50.740]  This really could be the cusp of one
[58:51.300 --> 58:56.900]  So yeah a long way of getting there. But you know if you wanted to answer, you know, what is what is cannabis to you?
[58:57.380 --> 58:59.860]  Yeah, I mean it's an enhancer. It's a uniter
[59:00.420 --> 59:02.820]  Uh, it's a medicine. It's a friend
[59:03.460 --> 59:10.100]  Uh, and as a uniter, I mean like, you know, it really does unite people that have almost nothing else in common
[59:10.740 --> 59:12.740]  Uh age
[59:13.060 --> 59:14.580]  race
[59:14.580 --> 59:16.580]  gender color
[59:17.620 --> 59:25.780]  Orient sexual orientation language all you know, it it just blurs all of the borders that we
[59:28.580 --> 59:30.420]  Kind of
[59:30.420 --> 59:35.620]  You know create out of nothing, you know, we just invent these lines between us
[59:36.180 --> 59:42.020]  Um, that's their hill this is our hill, you know and cannabis is something that lives on all the hills and like
[59:42.420 --> 59:44.820]  unites all the different hills and
[59:45.460 --> 59:47.460]  Uh, you can make a friend
[59:47.860 --> 59:49.460]  throughout the world
[59:49.460 --> 59:52.260]  Just by putting two two fingers together, you know
[59:52.900 --> 59:59.140]  And you don't share a language. You don't share a culture or whatever it might be but you share cannabis and so it's a it's uniter
[59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.420]  uh, it's a a friend and and
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.580]  And it um
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:12.180]  You know, it's really it's an enhancement and a medicine and I think uh, it's a healing flower it was placed here for a reason
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.900]  uh, you know, i'm not
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:16.900]  a religious person, but I do think that
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:21.860]  There's a reason that these plants have a specific effect. There's a reason why
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.860]  uh
[01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:25.860]  you know psychedelic mushrooms or
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:30.740]  Uh, ayahuasca or the other these other plant things do what they do
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:38.660]  Uh, and certainly anything can be abused, uh, but yeah, uh, it's pretty difficult to abuse cannabis
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:42.340]  uh comparatively to most of those other things and I think uh,
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.300]  I think it's just a a healing flower at the end of the day. It's it's it's a
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:51.780]  uh a part of our herbal repertoire and and something that um
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:58.120]  At with an endocannabinoid system you need to supply with cannabinoids
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.520]  Yeah, awesome
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.480]  Well said once again and and you know, I look at the clock
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.080]  We've been we've been here for about an hour and you know, I asked for about an hour of your time
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.160]  I appreciate that very much

[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:19.960]  Go ahead and throw them in I will try to get them up. Um, but before we go today

[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  Um northeast leaf magazine. We've got leaf magazines.com and then we're on instagram facebook and twitter
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.920]  uh as well
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:15.400]  I i'm always you know, really happy to now be two years in
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:22.600]  Uh with that magazine and the leaf nation of magazines including all those other states I mentioned earlier
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.280]  um
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.280]  Yeah, I got facebook instagram twitter
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.680]  Uh, you can buy my book on amazon if you buy it from me directly on ebay
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:37.000]  I can sign it for you if you put uh, if you put it in the the purchase notes, uh that you'd like it signed
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.880]  Um, it's probably a little cheaper than amazon as well
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.520]  uh, but uh
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.120]  yeah, um
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:48.440]  the the book the podcast and the magazine are are my uh,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.160]  You know my three big things that i've been pushing
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:58.120]  Uh, hope people will grow their own and like I said if they can't just push towards a system that you support
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.680]  Vote with your with your dollars
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.260]  Uh buy the products you want to see replicated
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:08.840]  um buy the products you want to see on the shelf at the price you want to see them at and
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.040]  Uh
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.400]  You know support
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.920]  Legacy growers support the people who've been in this industry
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:22.440]  Uh since before it was an industry when it was just a community or an underground scene or uh culture or whatever you want to call it
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.440]  uh, and
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.960]  you know just
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.720]  You know honor the plant. Um be an ambassador for the plant don't
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.260]  Uh, you know live up to any sort of stereotypes
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.560]  um
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:39.640]  You know defy the the the people that are trying to hold us back
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.320]  um vote certainly vote for politicians that
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:48.520]  Want to help us as cannabis consumers or producers or an industry?
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.360]  And uh, just keep up the good fight work to free the prisoners
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.440]  Um, that's another cause that's very important to me is that there's still people locked up
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.880]  For non-violent cannabis offenders. I know there's britney grinder that everyone's focused on
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:08.440]  Um, of course she should not be she should not be prosecuted in russia, but we've got people back home that also
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.360]  deserve that same
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:15.400]  uh support as well, um records getting expunged social equity
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.880]  uh social use, you know support
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.760]  places that open up and allow you to consume cannabis the same way people would have
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.600]  Uh a glass of wine or or beer or whatever it might be
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.920]  um gather together
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.040]  enjoy
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:36.600]  Uh focus on what unites us and not what divides us and uh, you know, just free the healing flower
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.760]  continue to
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.640]  be
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.360]  a steward and an ambassador for this, uh
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.600]  amazing plant
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:50.120]  That's rad. That's why I like you man. And and if you can't give a big shout out to mike g for me, please
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:51.880]  Absolutely
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:56.840]  He cracks me up mike. It's been years of listening to mike g that guy's got a rad sense of humor
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:59.780]  Absolutely
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:04.040]  A couple just a couple, uh quick questions here from uh the chat
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:10.120]  Um, let's see and i'm glad that he phrased it this way because this is always an interesting question. What am I trying to get?
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.160]  to my
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:17.640]  My little bubbles. There we go. Okay. Um, how about what is your current favorite strain?
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.880]  Like what are you gonna read for here in a moment?
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:27.480]  Um, you know my go-to for this question is always strawberry cough because I love I always love growing it
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:35.480]  I love smoking it. It's really just it's not doesn't have the potency or the power of uh, you know, cush's and
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:41.960]  diesels and and uh chem dogs and all of that, but it has just the perfect
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.520]  uplifting quality for me
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:47.160]  Um the you know, just slightly sativa dominant
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.720]  um turk profile that
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.880]  Uh, I enjoy
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.880]  uh daytime nighttime
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:06:00.040]  Um, so really kind of strawberry cough the real original one, uh is my kind of go-to but I love variety
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:05.160]  I mentioned this earlier as well. So if I only had to smoke just that one thing i'd probably get bored with it
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:09.480]  Um, I love the chem all the chem family of strains. I love
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.760]  You know our new york sours
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:16.920]  Uh that we have here that's like, you know, I love the hazes that we have here as well
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.640]  Uh got to participate in the piff cup
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.360]  recently judging some haze
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.680]  Uh varieties, which is a lot of fun
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.520]  um
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:29.480]  You know ogs and all that stuff out west. I mean
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:35.800]  Gelato, oh, you know the fruity stuff too. I I love it all I uh, I really do enjoy variety
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.880]  But if if it was desert island situation
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:44.360]  It'd be it'd be the strawberry cough and some of that has to do with how it grows too. It's just uh real solid and
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.040]  and
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.160]  You know
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:52.680]  I love the smell it leaves behind in a room almost like incense like it's not doesn't even smell like cannabis
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:56.520]  Sometimes people confuse it with with incense or something like like church
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:58.600]  incense
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.600]  It's old. It's old church books
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.880]  All right
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:07.560]  Like frankincense or myrrh or whatever those things were that they brought to jesus when he was a baby
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.280]  I was gonna make a joke there. No, okay. Um
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.200]  About there there's here and and i'm not sure if you
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:24.200]  Do much washing yourself, but is there a favorite cultivar that you have for washing or maybe that somebody else's wash?
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.280]  That you're just like, oh every time that
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.520]  Uh comes out magic for you
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:32.920]  Huh? That's a good one. That is a good one. I uh
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:38.360]  You know, I leave most of that up to the extract artists. Uh
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.440]  But wow, I can't really think of a cultivar that I
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.080]  Hmm
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:48.380]  I mean, I would say uh the banana
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.920]  uh the the
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:57.560]  Crockett family farms had like a strawberry banana. Yes thing that I just every time i've i've ever dabbed on that
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:03.720]  Uh has just had the sweetness and and flavor for me, uh that I really enjoy
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.440]  uh, that's I yeah
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:13.320]  Again with the strawberry but for some reason, uh, yeah, I guess I would say strawberry banana from crockett family farms
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:22.600]  Probably the one that's very unique and different when it's when it's washed and and also gives off a good amount of
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:25.640]  glandular trichomes of essential oils
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:30.760]  Um, i'm squirming over here because that is the one that got away from me. It was the
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:38.280]  2014 high times cup in everett, which was technically seattle cup here. Um, and uh
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.000]  There was just a big bowl of seeds and there was this family standing behind it
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.680]  That didn't look like they had anything to do with cannabis and they wanted for what?
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.200]  At that time to me was just like an outrageous price. It was these strawberry banana seeds. I'm just like
