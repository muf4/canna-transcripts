[00:14.080 --> 00:19.080]  And we're back for Scene Collectors, Volume 7.
[00:19.660 --> 00:21.240]  Hello, everybody.
[00:21.240 --> 00:22.960]  Good to see you this evening.
[00:22.960 --> 00:24.600]  Thanks for joining us again.
[00:24.600 --> 00:27.420]  See everybody popping in chat already.
[00:28.520 --> 00:33.080]  DankabissKind, SkunkApesClasswork, SammySays81,
[00:33.080 --> 00:38.080]  JonAnon, TieGuyGrowsHigh, that was a fun one to say.
[00:38.520 --> 00:41.880]  SodakMeggrower, South Dakota,
[00:41.880 --> 00:44.320]  that's what I'm guessing there, Sodak.
[00:44.320 --> 00:45.160]  It's like SoCat.
[00:45.160 --> 00:45.980]  It's good to hear.
[00:45.980 --> 00:46.820]  Southern California.
[00:46.820 --> 00:48.840]  Yeah, Dave knows everybody.
[00:48.840 --> 00:50.080]  That's the thing here.
[00:50.080 --> 00:51.360]  Dave knows everybody.
[00:51.360 --> 00:56.160]  And Dave actually brought someone to the show this week.
[00:56.160 --> 00:57.680]  He brought us James W.
[00:57.680 --> 01:02.560]  He said, Chad, this guy has been the bane of my existence.
[01:02.560 --> 01:05.720]  He bids on all the packs that I wanna bid on.
[01:05.720 --> 01:07.520]  We go back and forth.
[01:07.520 --> 01:10.480]  I wanna see this guy's face so I can give him the,
[01:10.480 --> 01:11.680]  no, he didn't really say that.
[01:12.640 --> 01:15.560]  So we really are going Jerry Springer is what you're saying.
[01:15.560 --> 01:17.040]  Yes.
[01:17.040 --> 01:18.520]  I made a promise to go Jerry Springer
[01:18.520 --> 01:19.840]  because in reality,
[01:19.840 --> 01:23.040]  these two do know each other through the auctions.
[01:23.040 --> 01:25.680]  I don't know, James, do you maybe wanna say hello,
[01:25.680 --> 01:27.860]  introduce yourself and kind of give a little backstory
[01:27.860 --> 01:28.700]  to that one?
[01:28.700 --> 01:30.200]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:30.200 --> 01:33.160]  So my name is James Wells.
[01:33.160 --> 01:35.120]  I am one of the co-founders
[01:35.120 --> 01:38.240]  of Joint Cannabis and Cultivation.
[01:38.240 --> 01:39.700]  Everything is based for us
[01:39.700 --> 01:42.000]  out of kind of the Metro Detroit area.
[01:43.260 --> 01:46.340]  And yeah, I mean, Dave and I met a couple of years ago
[01:46.340 --> 01:50.580]  because we were one-upping each other like mad on a charity.
[01:50.580 --> 01:52.900]  I think it was one of the many charity auctions
[01:52.900 --> 01:56.540]  for Lime Rising Farms.
[01:56.540 --> 02:01.540]  And yeah, we were kind of breaking the bank to be honest
[02:01.940 --> 02:03.380]  and having a riot doing it.
[02:03.380 --> 02:05.540]  And so from then on, we were just like,
[02:05.540 --> 02:08.580]  look, we need to share the love
[02:08.580 --> 02:10.860]  and not do that again.
[02:12.340 --> 02:15.660]  So ever since, man, it's been a match made in heaven.
[02:16.500 --> 02:17.580]  Well, that's awesome.
[02:17.580 --> 02:18.420]  That's awesome.
[02:18.420 --> 02:21.780]  You gotta stop, collaborate and listen.
[02:21.780 --> 02:22.620]  That's right.
[02:22.620 --> 02:24.780]  Okay, bad music pun number one of the evening.
[02:25.660 --> 02:28.580]  There will be more, but yeah, no,
[02:28.580 --> 02:31.540]  that's kind of cool that it was for the charity auction too.
[02:31.540 --> 02:34.620]  Sometimes it is great to see those kind of
[02:34.620 --> 02:36.140]  go progressively higher.
[02:37.060 --> 02:38.300]  As somebody who watches them,
[02:38.300 --> 02:40.260]  as somebody who supports the cause,
[02:41.180 --> 02:44.220]  it's fun for us to be living vicariously
[02:44.220 --> 02:45.660]  through you guys sometimes.
[02:46.860 --> 02:50.660]  And Dave, you've already got a brand new table laid out
[02:50.660 --> 02:51.860]  for us this evening.
[02:51.860 --> 02:54.540]  So maybe do you wanna give us a little backstory too
[02:54.540 --> 02:56.780]  about coming across James
[02:56.780 --> 02:59.100]  and maybe how you guys became friends
[02:59.100 --> 03:00.960]  instead of frenemies?
[03:01.980 --> 03:04.860]  Well, like you said, we had many, many a battle,
[03:04.860 --> 03:07.460]  one upping each other for auctions
[03:07.460 --> 03:08.940]  back a couple of years ago.
[03:08.940 --> 03:11.020]  But my first real encounter with him
[03:11.020 --> 03:12.620]  was he had actually donated
[03:12.620 --> 03:15.820]  because he's donated countless times to so many auctions.
[03:15.820 --> 03:19.620]  This is an absolute gentleman, an absolute gentleman.
[03:19.620 --> 03:21.900]  And my first real encounter with him,
[03:21.900 --> 03:23.780]  other than seeing, hey, this is just a guy
[03:23.780 --> 03:25.380]  I gotta look out for,
[03:25.380 --> 03:28.380]  was he donated for Seattle Chronic Seeds.
[03:29.860 --> 03:31.100]  Just helping him out.
[03:31.100 --> 03:33.220]  And he ended up sending me some stuff
[03:33.220 --> 03:35.420]  and that kind of got us talking to each other
[03:35.420 --> 03:38.620]  outside of bidding against each other.
[03:38.620 --> 03:41.140]  And it turned out he's a pretty cool dude.
[03:42.020 --> 03:44.180]  A guy who just...
[03:46.220 --> 03:48.340]  Kind of what I wanted to bring up tonight
[03:48.340 --> 03:49.460]  was there's been a lot of people
[03:49.460 --> 03:51.140]  that I've noticed in the community
[03:51.140 --> 03:55.980]  who have been just extremely generous, extremely friendly.
[03:55.980 --> 03:58.980]  Like people that are so willing
[03:58.980 --> 04:02.340]  to share their prizes with you
[04:02.500 --> 04:04.660]  and just, there's just a lot of great people.
[04:04.660 --> 04:07.340]  That's kind of what's on the table here right now.
[04:07.340 --> 04:11.540]  You've got some lovely stuff here from the American one.
[04:11.540 --> 04:13.220]  Is Andy Aces.
[04:13.220 --> 04:14.060]  Nice.
[04:14.060 --> 04:14.900]  Godiva.
[04:17.860 --> 04:18.700]  Ophelia.
[04:19.940 --> 04:22.220]  Blueberry Cheesecake.
[04:22.220 --> 04:23.780]  Nice.
[04:23.780 --> 04:27.020]  And those have been tested.
[04:27.020 --> 04:27.860]  Oh, not me.
[04:27.860 --> 04:29.260]  Geez, come on now.
[04:29.260 --> 04:31.220]  Nobody wants to see that.
[04:31.220 --> 04:32.060]  Oh, that's right.
[04:32.060 --> 04:33.780]  Cause I had the American one sticker in my hand.
[04:33.780 --> 04:34.860]  I'm like, yeah.
[04:37.900 --> 04:41.940]  But that one, he's gotten those all over the world now.
[04:41.940 --> 04:43.860]  And it's been cool to see some of the grows
[04:43.860 --> 04:46.460]  and the Blueberry Times Cheesequake in particular
[04:46.460 --> 04:49.380]  was fun to hear a lot of the UK guys saying,
[04:49.380 --> 04:51.980]  dude, this is like the UK cheese.
[04:51.980 --> 04:53.180]  It's the stinky stuff.
[04:53.180 --> 04:55.420]  And I'm just like, really?
[04:57.300 --> 04:58.380]  That's cool.
[04:58.380 --> 04:59.900]  Now, have you had the chance
[04:59.900 --> 05:02.660]  to pop any of the American ones gear?
[05:02.660 --> 05:04.900]  I wish I could say that I have.
[05:04.900 --> 05:06.300]  I have yet to.
[05:06.300 --> 05:09.380]  I'm honestly, everyone up here, I've yet to pop their stuff.
[05:09.380 --> 05:12.060]  I'm kind of a shitty friend in that regard,
[05:12.060 --> 05:14.260]  but they're in the works.
[05:14.260 --> 05:15.860]  I definitely plan on it one day.
[05:17.220 --> 05:20.380]  Well, James and I were kind of talking about that beforehand
[05:20.380 --> 05:23.180]  and you must've been on our wavelength
[05:23.180 --> 05:24.900]  because the table you spread out
[05:24.900 --> 05:26.100]  and kind of the reason you did it,
[05:26.100 --> 05:29.260]  but just the generosity of people in the community
[05:29.300 --> 05:30.540]  is pretty awesome.
[05:30.540 --> 05:31.380]  100%.
[05:32.340 --> 05:35.820]  You know, it's easy to,
[05:35.820 --> 05:40.020]  if you're someone in need to find good beans from somebody
[05:40.020 --> 05:43.220]  and even just as a friendly gesture,
[05:43.220 --> 05:45.020]  I'll just shout out Kazoo.
[05:45.020 --> 05:47.260]  Kazoo Kush as one person in particular
[05:47.260 --> 05:51.260]  who that guy has just hooked me the F up, man.
[05:51.260 --> 05:55.260]  Never said, yo dude, give me all you got.
[05:55.260 --> 05:57.100]  He's just like, you want a couple of seeds?
[05:57.100 --> 05:57.940]  Sure.
[06:00.100 --> 06:01.420]  Guys making it rain over here.
[06:01.420 --> 06:04.220]  So yeah, community has been pretty generous
[06:04.220 --> 06:05.580]  and I think that's really awesome.
[06:05.580 --> 06:08.700]  And that's something that we try to do and spread as well.
[06:08.700 --> 06:12.180]  Again, both of you guys donating to these auctions.
[06:12.180 --> 06:14.540]  So that's pretty bad-ass,
[06:14.540 --> 06:19.020]  but sometimes when we do good things, we regret it a little.
[06:19.020 --> 06:24.020]  So what is one pack that you guys have put into an auction
[06:24.220 --> 06:26.980]  or a donation that a little bit later,
[06:27.020 --> 06:30.940]  you're just like, damn, I wish I grabbed something else.
[06:33.540 --> 06:36.700]  You know, that's a really tough question to be honest.
[06:37.700 --> 06:41.900]  You know, I feel like I've been paid back so well
[06:41.900 --> 06:46.900]  in so many ways by good people that I'm more happy to,
[06:46.900 --> 06:48.820]  like I'm happier to give out the stuff
[06:48.820 --> 06:52.900]  than I am sometimes even to, you know, to worry about it.
[06:53.180 --> 06:57.340]  I mean, like, you know, if I had to pick something,
[06:57.340 --> 07:00.580]  I mean, I know I've thrown around some like,
[07:00.580 --> 07:04.460]  some really early stock Josh DOG from Karma
[07:04.460 --> 07:09.460]  that I may have wanted back, but like, otherwise,
[07:11.740 --> 07:15.580]  I mean, you know, you get so many amazing things
[07:15.580 --> 07:17.980]  from other people and they're, you know,
[07:17.980 --> 07:19.620]  they wanna help out too.
[07:19.620 --> 07:22.500]  And especially if you are doing a good deed for somebody,
[07:23.340 --> 07:25.460]  you know, they're all about, you know,
[07:25.460 --> 07:27.020]  giving something back.
[07:27.020 --> 07:30.780]  So, I mean, but that Josh deed is something that I will,
[07:30.780 --> 07:35.060]  you know, about a 30 pack of those kind of hurt,
[07:35.060 --> 07:38.100]  but I have enough still, so we're good.
[07:38.100 --> 07:40.820]  Right, and you know, no regrets, but I asked,
[07:40.820 --> 07:43.060]  I'm like, if you had to pick one, so.
[07:43.060 --> 07:45.980]  If I had to pick one, you know, but at the same time,
[07:45.980 --> 07:49.260]  what is great about the love on, you know, this community
[07:49.260 --> 07:52.260]  is so many people are just like, dude, just let me know.
[07:53.020 --> 07:54.620]  And I'll send you a cut of what the best thing I find.
[07:54.620 --> 07:57.660]  Like, I got no issues doing it and I'm happy to do it.
[07:57.660 --> 08:00.980]  And I pretty much do the same thing is like,
[08:00.980 --> 08:03.140]  we have that deal with a lot of people where like,
[08:03.140 --> 08:06.420]  if we find something, you know, I have that with Dave.
[08:06.420 --> 08:09.580]  It's like, if I find something special out of, you know,
[08:09.580 --> 08:11.900]  I got a really big collection of Bodhi stuff.
[08:11.900 --> 08:14.460]  And if I find a bunch of his gear
[08:14.460 --> 08:17.340]  and there's some special stuff in it, you know,
[08:17.340 --> 08:18.820]  Dave's gonna get some, you know,
[08:18.820 --> 08:21.100]  it's just gonna happen.
[08:21.100 --> 08:23.580]  Nice, that's rad, man.
[08:23.580 --> 08:25.980]  And Dave, you know, I wanna throw it to you too,
[08:25.980 --> 08:27.540]  cause I know you have definitely,
[08:27.540 --> 08:29.540]  and you know, you're silent about it.
[08:29.540 --> 08:32.660]  You don't advertise it, but good people do good things
[08:32.660 --> 08:35.020]  without anybody needing to know about it.
[08:35.020 --> 08:36.740]  But I'm gonna call you out on it tonight
[08:36.740 --> 08:40.780]  because you give to some of these auctions
[08:40.780 --> 08:44.580]  and some of these charity fundraisers that we do,
[08:44.580 --> 08:46.500]  very much appreciated.
[08:46.500 --> 08:48.900]  But what is maybe something that you accidentally set
[08:48.900 --> 08:50.340]  in the wrong pile?
[08:51.220 --> 08:53.700]  Yeah, well, I can think of something
[08:53.700 --> 08:57.740]  right off the top of my head that I don't regret
[08:57.740 --> 09:00.740]  giving it up, but yeah, I guess I gotta do.
[09:00.740 --> 09:03.460]  The Girl Scout Cookies Coca-Cola Root Beer
[09:03.460 --> 09:05.580]  from a Lime Rising, that's something
[09:05.580 --> 09:07.500]  that I had recently given up,
[09:07.500 --> 09:10.460]  but I gave it out right back to the creator.
[09:10.460 --> 09:11.420]  So it's all good.
[09:12.300 --> 09:13.620]  Nice, there you go.
[09:13.620 --> 09:15.180]  What the hell else am I thinking of?
[09:15.180 --> 09:18.620]  Oh, HP 13 and Root Beer.
[09:18.660 --> 09:20.860]  That was one that I let out,
[09:20.860 --> 09:23.020]  and I kind of regret letting some of those out
[09:23.020 --> 09:24.980]  because there were only 20 of them.
[09:24.980 --> 09:26.700]  But hey, it's all good.
[09:26.700 --> 09:29.980]  I'm happy to see that the person who I gave them to,
[09:29.980 --> 09:31.500]  they are gonna grow them, so.
[09:31.500 --> 09:32.340]  Nice.
[09:33.260 --> 09:35.500]  And that is kind of a factor too,
[09:35.500 --> 09:39.580]  is it's great to have a lot of this variety.
[09:39.580 --> 09:42.660]  It's great to have a lot of these rare,
[09:42.660 --> 09:46.820]  or rare-er things that it's not mass production.
[09:47.180 --> 09:50.420]  It's that special foil baseball card in the pack
[09:50.420 --> 09:53.260]  you get out of one per box or something.
[09:54.340 --> 09:57.740]  But we can't possibly pop them all, even though we try.
[09:57.740 --> 10:02.100]  So it is nice to give some of those gems away
[10:02.100 --> 10:04.180]  to people that you know are gonna grow them.
[10:04.180 --> 10:05.020]  Definitely.
[10:05.020 --> 10:06.940]  100%, 100%.
[10:06.940 --> 10:09.940]  And also just knowing that it makes their day, man.
[10:09.940 --> 10:11.780]  Some guys will come back to me
[10:11.780 --> 10:13.620]  after I've given them a pack of something
[10:13.620 --> 10:15.380]  that they were really looking for,
[10:15.380 --> 10:18.420]  and they're just like, oh my God, man, I am so pumped.
[10:18.420 --> 10:20.980]  This has been one of the best grows I have out there,
[10:20.980 --> 10:23.380]  and I'm just sitting back there like, yes!
[10:23.380 --> 10:25.820]  I'm glad I could do something good for you.
[10:25.820 --> 10:26.980]  Totally.
[10:26.980 --> 10:27.900]  It's fun, man.
[10:27.900 --> 10:31.300]  It's fun seeing others happy and succeed too.
[10:31.300 --> 10:33.220]  100%.
[10:33.220 --> 10:34.940]  And if they live close enough, you get to smoke it.
[10:34.940 --> 10:35.780]  So that's always a bonus.
[10:35.780 --> 10:37.060]  There you go, there you go.
[10:37.060 --> 10:39.780]  Have local friends.
[10:39.780 --> 10:43.780]  Local charities, that's the way to go.
[10:43.780 --> 10:45.140]  Local charities.
[10:45.900 --> 10:48.260]  Well, I guess I wanna start it off tonight.
[10:48.260 --> 10:52.100]  And this is coming from Dave.
[10:52.100 --> 10:55.580]  So I'm gonna pretend like he's never had these
[10:55.580 --> 10:57.420]  and it's all mine.
[10:57.420 --> 11:00.180]  But actually, little confession,
[11:00.180 --> 11:04.420]  this is my first freeborn selections pack
[11:04.420 --> 11:05.660]  that I've ever had,
[11:05.660 --> 11:08.380]  which is kind of crazy, all things considered.
[11:08.380 --> 11:12.540]  So I'm really stoked because Mean Gene,
[11:12.580 --> 11:15.100]  Jackson, he is legit.
[11:16.460 --> 11:21.460]  This is the Runtz times the G33 Cherry Limeade.
[11:22.540 --> 11:25.740]  So when he says it's the Runtz,
[11:26.740 --> 11:30.300]  I'm going to assume that it is the right Runtz.
[11:30.300 --> 11:32.460]  It's a good one that he's grown it out,
[11:32.460 --> 11:33.620]  that he's verified it.
[11:33.620 --> 11:35.900]  And he's like, yeah, that's the Runtz.
[11:37.540 --> 11:39.180]  I'm excited about that.
[11:39.180 --> 11:44.020]  And then also the other thing is the G33 times Cherry Limeade
[11:44.020 --> 11:48.420]  is the stud male that Dave just can't stop raving about.
[11:50.540 --> 11:52.180]  Anything that's touched that I've grown,
[11:52.180 --> 11:55.020]  especially that Runtz, what you have there,
[11:55.020 --> 11:56.180]  love growing that.
[11:56.180 --> 11:59.220]  What a turf monster, just absolutely stinky.
[11:59.220 --> 12:00.460]  And she surprised me too,
[12:00.460 --> 12:02.940]  because she was kind of the Runtz of the garden.
[12:02.940 --> 12:04.900]  I wasn't really expecting much out of her.
[12:04.900 --> 12:07.660]  And then boom, in flower, turned everything around,
[12:07.660 --> 12:08.700]  just knocked everything,
[12:08.700 --> 12:12.060]  every other plant in the tent out of the park.
[12:12.060 --> 12:14.780]  Nice, now what should I kind of expect
[12:14.780 --> 12:16.500]  as far as growing this out?
[12:16.500 --> 12:18.740]  Runtz, I haven't grown it myself,
[12:18.740 --> 12:21.660]  but I've heard that it can be kind of a bitch to grow out,
[12:21.660 --> 12:26.660]  little picky, but with that influence.
[12:26.860 --> 12:29.420]  And granted, I mean, if we want to get over technical,
[12:29.420 --> 12:30.900]  there's phenotypic variation
[12:30.900 --> 12:33.060]  and we might not see the same thing from every seed.
[12:33.060 --> 12:35.660]  Let's just skip over that and have some fun tonight.
[12:36.260 --> 12:40.700]  What should I kind of expect to see out of this batch?
[12:40.700 --> 12:44.820]  Because I'll probably pop half of them right away.
[12:44.820 --> 12:47.460]  And then we're the two seed keepers,
[12:47.460 --> 12:49.660]  always keep back two seeds just in case.
[12:49.660 --> 12:51.460]  Yes, yes.
[12:51.460 --> 12:54.780]  I definitely found her to be a little on the picky side,
[12:54.780 --> 12:58.380]  but if you treat her right, she treats you right.
[12:58.380 --> 13:00.380]  And is it like picky as in watering
[13:00.380 --> 13:02.580]  or is it picky as in like fertilization?
[13:02.620 --> 13:07.500]  It needs more or it needs less or just all around picky?
[13:07.500 --> 13:10.740]  I found, because I do run more of the organic style,
[13:10.740 --> 13:14.020]  so I found it was maybe I had a little too much
[13:14.020 --> 13:15.660]  going on in there for her.
[13:15.660 --> 13:18.180]  Okay, okay.
[13:18.180 --> 13:20.820]  Other than that, that was the only issues I seem to find
[13:20.820 --> 13:23.780]  is that she didn't really like that initial shock
[13:23.780 --> 13:27.300]  of going into my soil treatment, my soil blend.
[13:27.300 --> 13:29.260]  Okay, maybe it was like too hot.
[13:29.260 --> 13:32.460]  Did you just pop it straight from seed and put it in there
[13:33.340 --> 13:35.500]  or did you get it a clone or a little bit of roots
[13:35.500 --> 13:38.020]  before you put it into your beds?
[13:38.020 --> 13:40.580]  I pop it on the side
[13:40.580 --> 13:42.340]  and then I throw them in there a little later.
[13:42.340 --> 13:45.620]  I wish I could say that they were full living soil beds.
[13:45.620 --> 13:46.460]  They're not quite.
[13:47.300 --> 13:48.140]  Right.
[13:48.140 --> 13:49.100]  I wish I could get there.
[13:49.100 --> 13:50.660]  Yeah, well, I'm using, you know,
[13:50.660 --> 13:55.180]  I use that Sohum Living Soil, which is, it's a bag soil.
[13:55.180 --> 13:57.900]  It's a water only, but it is a little hot.
[13:57.900 --> 13:59.780]  So, you know, I have,
[13:59.780 --> 14:02.500]  they told me not to put my clones directly into it,
[14:02.500 --> 14:03.540]  but I do.
[14:04.380 --> 14:06.220]  And there's been a couple of times where I'm just like,
[14:06.220 --> 14:10.060]  ooh, you got a little, a little extra juice.
[14:10.060 --> 14:11.260]  A little spicy.
[14:11.260 --> 14:14.660]  Yeah, but everything else has worked fine since then.
[14:14.660 --> 14:17.660]  And James, it looked like you may have had some experience
[14:17.660 --> 14:19.700]  growing the runs out before.
[14:19.700 --> 14:20.900]  Yeah, I have.
[14:22.140 --> 14:26.660]  So my growing partner in crime is,
[14:27.660 --> 14:30.980]  it's a finicky little plant with runs,
[14:30.980 --> 14:33.020]  but really, I mean, the gem out of that
[14:33.020 --> 14:34.660]  is that cherry limeade.
[14:34.660 --> 14:39.660]  I have crosses of that cherry limeade to Mendo Breath,
[14:40.460 --> 14:44.660]  to a few other really unique cuts.
[14:44.660 --> 14:46.980]  And that cherry limeade is,
[14:46.980 --> 14:48.620]  there's something really special about it.
[14:48.620 --> 14:53.620]  It is so, it is so turpy and so beautiful smelling
[14:56.820 --> 15:00.380]  and at the same time, it's not quite as loud and crazy
[15:00.380 --> 15:02.420]  as sometimes when you were throwing,
[15:02.420 --> 15:05.580]  like I know this is your first freeborn stuff,
[15:05.580 --> 15:07.260]  but maybe, I don't know if Dave,
[15:07.260 --> 15:10.220]  if you've ever run like the lime pop stuff,
[15:10.220 --> 15:12.420]  but the lime pop stuff from him
[15:12.420 --> 15:14.700]  could get a little overwhelming in the cross.
[15:14.700 --> 15:15.860]  Whereas the cherry limeade,
[15:15.860 --> 15:18.540]  I feel like just meshes beautifully
[15:18.540 --> 15:21.140]  with almost like anything you throw with it.
[15:21.140 --> 15:24.140]  So I think you'll be really, really happy.
[15:25.140 --> 15:25.980]  Yes.
[15:25.980 --> 15:26.820]  Yes.
[15:26.820 --> 15:27.660]  Yes.
[15:27.660 --> 15:30.500]  And actually that Mendo Breath cherry limeade
[15:30.500 --> 15:33.020]  you were talking about, you actually gave me some.
[15:33.020 --> 15:34.060]  Oh, yes I did.
[15:34.060 --> 15:35.300]  That's right.
[15:35.300 --> 15:38.340]  Cause you're a wonderful man, that's why.
[15:38.340 --> 15:40.100]  I am a fan of the Mendo Breath.
[15:40.100 --> 15:41.380]  I do like that.
[15:41.380 --> 15:45.260]  That has a bit more of like a gassier profile
[15:45.260 --> 15:48.460]  than kind of what it sounds like we're describing here.
[15:48.460 --> 15:51.220]  But if the two, if it worked,
[15:51.220 --> 15:53.300]  well, half and half, you get the new flavor.
[15:53.380 --> 15:54.220]  Yeah, the world's alive.
[15:54.220 --> 15:55.060]  Oh, that would be beautiful.
[15:55.060 --> 15:55.900]  That's good stuff.
[15:55.900 --> 15:56.860]  That's good stuff.
[15:57.900 --> 15:58.740]  I'm excited.
[15:58.740 --> 16:01.420]  I'm excited to, even more excited to grow those out now.
[16:01.420 --> 16:05.340]  I'm a little bit giddy cause Terps are my jam.
[16:05.340 --> 16:06.180]  Nice.
[16:06.180 --> 16:07.020]  Yeah.
[16:07.020 --> 16:12.020]  What kind of profile do you typically look for James?
[16:12.140 --> 16:14.980]  I know Dave's a little more of a gas guy.
[16:14.980 --> 16:17.940]  I am definitely a gas hound too.
[16:17.940 --> 16:18.860]  I'm gonna be honest.
[16:18.860 --> 16:22.300]  Like I love the chems, the diesels,
[16:22.700 --> 16:27.180]  my wife and I were out in,
[16:27.180 --> 16:29.980]  lived out in Boston for several years
[16:29.980 --> 16:33.900]  and just got introduced to a lot of that really,
[16:33.900 --> 16:38.460]  just the original throwback gear that just makes,
[16:38.460 --> 16:41.260]  oh, it's like, it's just fuel on the nose.
[16:41.260 --> 16:44.220]  And man, when you smoke it, it's just perfect.
[16:44.220 --> 16:48.220]  So I am definitely in the same mindset.
[16:49.100 --> 16:50.700]  I have a couple of,
[16:51.500 --> 16:54.540]  we're actually gonna be doing a pretty big hunt
[16:54.540 --> 16:57.660]  of some I-95 work here.
[16:57.660 --> 16:59.500]  That's gonna be really quite interesting
[16:59.500 --> 17:04.260]  that a good buddy of mine has been,
[17:04.260 --> 17:09.260]  I mean, he works some incredible lines off of this
[17:09.620 --> 17:13.100]  and has shared it with a number of different people
[17:13.100 --> 17:16.620]  and has been really successful with it.
[17:16.620 --> 17:19.140]  So we're gonna do a big project hunting all that.
[17:19.140 --> 17:23.060]  And I-95 obviously very gassy,
[17:23.060 --> 17:28.060]  full of everything sour gas, chem that you can imagine.
[17:31.340 --> 17:34.060]  Kind of a cool thing to throw in there,
[17:34.060 --> 17:35.860]  looking at a throwback here,
[17:35.860 --> 17:39.700]  thinking of Lucky Dog for a second,
[17:39.700 --> 17:41.820]  the Stunk VA himself,
[17:41.820 --> 17:46.820]  is I actually have some of the original Silver Chem S1s
[17:50.140 --> 17:55.140]  and then also the Silver Chem Crush that he put out,
[17:59.100 --> 18:02.700]  I think it was like 2016 at the Emerald Cup.
[18:02.700 --> 18:06.300]  And I mean, these were just kind of his babies,
[18:06.300 --> 18:09.500]  the Chem Crush and the Silver Chem were two that,
[18:10.460 --> 18:13.860]  you know, were really, really early stuff
[18:13.860 --> 18:15.820]  that, you know, came from a,
[18:15.820 --> 18:19.100]  the Chem Crush I know came from a really early,
[18:19.100 --> 18:22.900]  may have been the original SFVOG cut.
[18:22.900 --> 18:25.900]  And the Silver Chem,
[18:25.900 --> 18:28.820]  if you go back and take a look at some of the photos of it,
[18:28.820 --> 18:32.420]  it's just like, it's such a beautiful plant, man.
[18:32.420 --> 18:34.460]  It's really, really awesome.
[18:34.460 --> 18:38.020]  So, I mean, again, this is where the community came in
[18:38.020 --> 18:40.340]  and did something really, you know, it was really nice
[18:40.340 --> 18:44.060]  and, you know, was able to make a cool trade with a friend
[18:44.380 --> 18:46.340]  and he was able to hook me up with it.
[18:46.340 --> 18:51.260]  So, we'll definitely be exploring those as time goes on.
[18:51.260 --> 18:52.220]  That is rad.
[18:52.220 --> 18:54.100]  And, you know, I've had,
[18:54.100 --> 18:57.180]  I'm actually growing his Twin Peaks right now.
[18:57.180 --> 18:58.020]  Oh, it's got VA.
[18:58.020 --> 19:01.300]  Beautiful stuff, I got a pack of that right here as well.
[19:01.300 --> 19:03.580]  And that, you know, again, we were talking earlier
[19:03.580 --> 19:06.140]  about the, you know, the beauty of the community.
[19:06.140 --> 19:08.780]  I was on a show kind of like this
[19:08.780 --> 19:12.420]  and we were just talking and a person watching
[19:13.220 --> 19:15.180]  heard me talking about, you know, chem.
[19:15.180 --> 19:18.100]  I love chem 91, like pre chem 91, 91.
[19:18.100 --> 19:20.500]  I love that in my top strains.
[19:20.500 --> 19:22.340]  And he's a seed collector as well.
[19:22.340 --> 19:24.340]  He's actually on, I think it was episode two,
[19:24.340 --> 19:26.180]  episode two or three.
[19:26.180 --> 19:29.500]  We brought him in, but he said,
[19:29.500 --> 19:32.260]  hey, I think this pack belongs to you.
[19:32.260 --> 19:35.820]  It's Twin Peaks, which is kind of the, you know,
[19:35.820 --> 19:38.340]  I'd do in the Twin Peaks cannabis thing.
[19:38.340 --> 19:42.060]  He's like, it's the chem 91 times chem cis.
[19:42.700 --> 19:43.540]  I think it belongs to you.
[19:43.540 --> 19:44.580]  Where can I send it?
[19:44.580 --> 19:47.020]  I was just like, holy shit.
[19:47.020 --> 19:48.860]  Never met him before.
[19:48.860 --> 19:51.620]  I mean, since then, you know, obviously, cool dude.
[19:51.620 --> 19:52.780]  We've had good conversations.
[19:52.780 --> 19:55.020]  He's been a guest on this show,
[19:55.020 --> 19:58.260]  but when it comes to the chem family,
[19:58.260 --> 20:03.260]  skunk VA is pretty much the last word, the authority.
[20:05.060 --> 20:07.680]  I don't know, what would you guys say there?
[20:08.680 --> 20:10.080]  You nailed it.
[20:10.080 --> 20:12.560]  Yeah, I think you got it, man.
[20:12.560 --> 20:15.840]  He's the man that's been, you know,
[20:15.840 --> 20:17.480]  running the chems forever.
[20:18.320 --> 20:22.760]  You know, the other chem that was a great, great old chem
[20:22.760 --> 20:24.480]  that some people may remember
[20:24.480 --> 20:29.120]  was the old insane seed posse 91 chem that he did
[20:29.120 --> 20:31.920]  or that they did that was just, I mean,
[20:31.920 --> 20:36.920]  that was like putting a fricking gas flamethrower
[20:37.040 --> 20:38.440]  to your nose and you're just like,
[20:38.440 --> 20:41.080]  whoo, okay, all right, we get it.
[20:41.080 --> 20:43.560]  It's there, but there's nothing better
[20:43.560 --> 20:47.400]  than skunk VA's work as far as he's the authority on it.
[20:47.400 --> 20:50.480]  And for good reason, he's put a lot of time
[20:50.480 --> 20:53.880]  into, you know, just those strains.
[20:53.880 --> 20:57.080]  And I think that is so cool that he has his niche
[20:57.080 --> 21:00.520]  and he works away at it and continues to find,
[21:00.520 --> 21:03.480]  you know, different ways of, you know,
[21:03.480 --> 21:06.600]  while keeping the tradition alive with it
[21:07.280 --> 21:08.760]  is adding a few new elements to it
[21:08.760 --> 21:10.800]  and just continuing to let it evolve.
[21:12.520 --> 21:15.040]  Yeah, he's pulled some good stuff out of there.
[21:15.040 --> 21:16.880]  And it is kind of good to hear that.
[21:16.880 --> 21:18.600]  Cause again, going back to, you know,
[21:18.600 --> 21:21.120]  the freeborn selections, when he says it's runs,
[21:21.120 --> 21:23.720]  I know it's runs.
[21:23.720 --> 21:26.440]  When you're looking for a chem, whether it be, you know,
[21:26.440 --> 21:28.760]  chem 91, chem D, chem four,
[21:30.240 --> 21:34.040]  when you go to lucky dog, CCO skunk VA,
[21:34.040 --> 21:36.200]  you know, that's what it really is.
[21:36.800 --> 21:37.720]  And so that's a great place
[21:37.720 --> 21:39.480]  to just build a solid foundation.
[21:39.480 --> 21:43.840]  I mean, obviously he's built a legacy, a brand off of it.
[21:43.840 --> 21:45.400]  100%, yeah.
[21:46.360 --> 21:47.880]  So that's exciting.
[21:47.880 --> 21:51.320]  Dave, what do you have that might be fuel
[21:51.320 --> 21:53.760]  in that little pile right there?
[21:53.760 --> 21:54.600]  Since you love the fuel.
[21:54.600 --> 21:56.280]  I'm gonna run and turn off my dehumidifier
[21:56.280 --> 21:57.560]  too real quick guys, I'm sorry.
[21:57.560 --> 21:59.840]  It's making me so fricking hot right now.
[21:59.840 --> 22:02.520]  I see some dog, the dog father up there.
[22:02.520 --> 22:03.360]  Is that what you're saying?
[22:03.360 --> 22:06.160]  I'll make you big here and then I'll go turn my thing off.
[22:07.120 --> 22:07.960]  Oh yeah, dog father.
[22:07.960 --> 22:08.800]  My camera's almost-
[22:08.800 --> 22:09.960]  There you go, man.
[22:09.960 --> 22:12.400]  Got the local D, which is local skunk,
[22:12.400 --> 22:16.040]  I tray and top dog sour diesel BX3.
[22:16.040 --> 22:18.360]  I love all the work that this guy did.
[22:18.360 --> 22:21.120]  He's took some top notch people, mix them together.
[22:21.120 --> 22:23.560]  Yes, the dog father.
[22:24.800 --> 22:28.680]  Burnout chem, FCR, BX, yellow snow,
[22:28.680 --> 22:30.240]  alien vintage blueberry.
[22:30.240 --> 22:31.400]  Yellow snow.
[22:33.280 --> 22:34.200]  That's a new one.
[22:34.960 --> 22:37.440]  Highway robbery, one tray.
[22:37.440 --> 22:38.440]  One tray.
[22:38.440 --> 22:42.400]  Throwing three awesome, you can't go wrong there.
[22:42.400 --> 22:43.240]  Absolutely.
[22:43.240 --> 22:47.120]  So where, I'm not familiar with the dog father.
[22:47.120 --> 22:47.960]  Where-
[22:47.960 --> 22:49.200]  He's Michigan based.
[22:49.200 --> 22:52.480]  Okay, Michigan based.
[22:52.480 --> 22:56.280]  Yeah, and he does some, he seems like he's,
[22:56.280 --> 22:57.480]  and correct me if I'm wrong Dave,
[22:57.480 --> 23:00.640]  but I think primarily does a lot of the diesels
[23:00.680 --> 23:05.680]  and the chems and it kind of goes off that track with,
[23:07.920 --> 23:10.320]  but it's always kind of staying around like the karma,
[23:10.320 --> 23:15.320]  sour diesels and the various chems and stuff out there.
[23:15.480 --> 23:16.920]  You are a hundred percent right.
[23:16.920 --> 23:19.000]  That is what he loves to play with.
[23:19.000 --> 23:20.400]  They're all right up my alley.
[23:20.400 --> 23:22.160]  They're all right up your alley.
[23:22.160 --> 23:24.760]  You just can't go wrong with anything that he works with.
[23:24.760 --> 23:29.000]  I've been very, I started out as just a trade with him.
[23:29.040 --> 23:30.960]  I was like, hey, yeah, I'll send you some seeds.
[23:30.960 --> 23:33.720]  He wanted to send me some seeds and boom.
[23:33.720 --> 23:35.320]  I happened to see what they all were.
[23:35.320 --> 23:36.640]  And I was like, oh shit,
[23:36.640 --> 23:38.400]  you put some killers together, man.
[23:39.960 --> 23:41.000]  Very nice.
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.400]  Now what, you know, it's interesting
[23:44.400 --> 23:45.600]  because we'll talk about,
[23:45.600 --> 23:46.920]  we're talking about like the gas smell.
[23:46.920 --> 23:48.240]  We're talking about the fuel
[23:48.240 --> 23:50.080]  and we're looking at five different packs.
[23:50.080 --> 23:50.920]  You had a pack.
[23:50.920 --> 23:52.000]  I had a different pack.
[23:53.440 --> 23:55.600]  What are some of like the nuances
[23:55.600 --> 23:57.040]  that you guys like to find?
[23:57.040 --> 23:59.640]  Or like, have you found any like nuances
[23:59.640 --> 24:04.640]  that distinguish one breeders, maybe gas over another?
[24:04.640 --> 24:07.000]  Cause there's a lot of descriptive words out there.
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.520]  Gas is like the catch all,
[24:08.520 --> 24:10.360]  but then you've got, you know, the tennis ball,
[24:10.360 --> 24:14.680]  you got the burnt rubber, the kerosene.
[24:14.680 --> 24:16.120]  New shoe leather.
[24:16.120 --> 24:17.000]  New shoe leather.
[24:17.000 --> 24:18.560]  Yeah. What are some of the fun?
[24:19.480 --> 24:22.040]  There's so many different crazy things out there
[24:22.040 --> 24:25.000]  to describe the different kinds of profiles you'll get
[24:25.320 --> 24:26.840]  from a lot of these gases.
[24:27.720 --> 24:31.040]  I can't say that my nose is as discerning
[24:31.040 --> 24:34.520]  as some of maybe like a mean gene
[24:34.520 --> 24:39.520]  being able to work with his Crayola box of varieties there.
[24:39.520 --> 24:41.760]  I've got the eight pack.
[24:41.760 --> 24:43.000]  He's got the 64.
[24:46.360 --> 24:48.680]  Yeah. I mean, that's, no, that's totally true, man.
[24:48.680 --> 24:51.280]  And it's like, I mean, some, you know,
[24:51.280 --> 24:54.320]  like I always found that a lot of like the true,
[24:54.720 --> 24:58.360]  true original diesel, for example, just always the,
[24:58.360 --> 25:01.320]  the first thing that came to mind was fuel was just like a
[25:01.320 --> 25:03.840]  big hit of fuel off that plant.
[25:03.840 --> 25:06.640]  And it just, it just smelled like, like if you,
[25:06.640 --> 25:10.240]  if you literally just put a gas gasoline in your car or
[25:10.240 --> 25:12.600]  something, or just sprayed some gasoline,
[25:12.600 --> 25:13.880]  that's what it smells like.
[25:13.880 --> 25:18.080]  Like it just has this very unique characteristic to it that
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.080]  just every time I smell it, I'm like, oh, that's gotta be,
[25:22.080 --> 25:25.040]  that's gotta come from an original, original diesel.
[25:25.040 --> 25:26.520]  Cause it just has that,
[25:26.520 --> 25:30.440]  that nose that's quite unique to most of the other diesel
[25:30.440 --> 25:32.320]  plants that, that you find.
[25:32.320 --> 25:34.720]  So that would be maybe one that I would,
[25:34.720 --> 25:35.920]  I would throw out there.
[25:38.560 --> 25:43.520]  Now, sour, you know, sour kind of falls into, I don't know.
[25:43.520 --> 25:45.400]  It seems to be like, if you like the gas,
[25:45.400 --> 25:47.680]  you like the diesel, you also like the sour.
[25:47.680 --> 25:51.640]  So where, where does like sour kind of play into this?
[25:52.200 --> 25:54.200]  Some of the sour diesels,
[25:54.200 --> 25:57.040]  you're still hitting that gas node or are you really getting
[25:57.040 --> 26:01.360]  more of a like tangy sourness to it in the end?
[26:01.360 --> 26:04.840]  Yeah. Some of them do tend to lean more towards that citrus
[26:04.840 --> 26:07.120]  kind of sour, tangy flavor.
[26:07.120 --> 26:10.720]  As opposed to just being pure gasoline or diesel or
[26:10.720 --> 26:14.600]  kerosene or whatever kind of fuel you want to say it's,
[26:14.600 --> 26:15.640]  it smells like.
[26:15.640 --> 26:18.240]  There are subtle differences between them, definitely.
[26:18.240 --> 26:20.600]  But in my experience, a lot of those,
[26:21.040 --> 26:25.280]  the best sour I ever had that was slightly tangy while
[26:25.280 --> 26:29.000]  still carrying so much fuel and pungency to it.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.120]  I tell you, I'm chasing that every,
[26:31.120 --> 26:36.120]  every sour or diesel cut or thing I pop is I am trying to
[26:36.120 --> 26:38.520]  mimic that flavor I had 20 plus years ago.
[26:38.520 --> 26:40.760]  And still wait, still wait.
[26:43.360 --> 26:45.480]  Well, I wish you luck.
[26:45.480 --> 26:47.120]  I hope you find that.
[26:47.120 --> 26:49.680]  Cause when you do, I'll be like, hey bro, what's that?
[26:49.720 --> 26:50.640]  No, I'm just joking.
[26:50.640 --> 26:51.720]  Yeah.
[26:51.720 --> 26:53.440]  I will share. I will share.
[26:54.360 --> 26:57.720]  I know that, that Top Dog had said that like,
[26:57.720 --> 27:00.560]  and people had agreed that the, you know, the BX,
[27:00.560 --> 27:02.960]  the triple back cross that he did was,
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.240]  was pretty overwhelming on the, on the sour funk.
[27:08.240 --> 27:11.040]  And was, was kind of blowing your nose off a little bit.
[27:11.040 --> 27:14.720]  Whereas the, the, I have not run the BX4 yet.
[27:14.720 --> 27:18.560]  I have several packs of it that I'm kind of waiting to work
[27:18.600 --> 27:23.600]  through. But that one from, from him says that, that,
[27:23.600 --> 27:24.440]  you know,
[27:24.440 --> 27:26.880]  it is the closest thing that he has had to kind of the
[27:26.880 --> 27:31.200]  original to capturing that sort of original essence of the,
[27:31.200 --> 27:32.360]  of the sour diesel.
[27:32.360 --> 27:35.520]  So I'm really curious to see what, what,
[27:35.520 --> 27:38.960]  what comes of that. As I said, I have not grown it per se.
[27:38.960 --> 27:42.120]  This is just what I have heard from,
[27:42.120 --> 27:46.200]  from him and from a few other people who have grown it and
[27:46.200 --> 27:49.480]  have a, have a great, great palette for,
[27:49.480 --> 27:54.120]  for this kind of stuff. So it'll be interesting to see how,
[27:54.120 --> 27:57.040]  how it rates to like the, the, the, you know,
[27:57.040 --> 28:00.760]  double back cross and the triple and stuff. So.
[28:02.440 --> 28:04.120]  I'm excited to see, I hope you get it.
[28:04.120 --> 28:06.640]  I hope it's delicious and everything that you want it to be,
[28:06.640 --> 28:08.000]  because I want it so bad.
[28:10.240 --> 28:13.560]  No, I see. And, and I am reading chat to you guys.
[28:13.560 --> 28:15.640]  I'm starring some of these questions so I can bring them up
[28:16.080 --> 28:17.200]  a little bit later.
[28:17.200 --> 28:21.440]  So far, nothing we've covered has been on Daga or actually the
[28:21.440 --> 28:24.560]  Amy Aces from the American, Amy Aces.
[28:24.560 --> 28:26.680]  That one's available on Daga right now,
[28:28.320 --> 28:29.160]  but we'll,
[28:29.160 --> 28:31.400]  we'll try to call them out when they are available on
[28:31.400 --> 28:32.240]  there.
[28:33.200 --> 28:37.040]  Let's see here. We had any older packs pre 2k.
[28:38.280 --> 28:40.880]  Yeah, man. I got, I got a good one actually to throw up
[28:40.880 --> 28:42.440]  here. That'll be kind of fun.
[28:42.720 --> 28:44.280]  Do it, do it, do it.
[28:44.280 --> 28:48.800]  So this is, this was actually, it's, it's called,
[28:48.800 --> 28:50.720]  it was, oh, that's okay.
[28:51.600 --> 28:54.040]  It's actually called French connection.
[28:54.040 --> 28:54.880]  Oh wow.
[28:54.880 --> 28:58.480]  And this was a round table selection, but really this was a,
[28:58.480 --> 29:02.760]  this was just an old school NorCal collaboration of Woodman
[29:02.760 --> 29:07.760]  Canyon, sour diesel, 78 Pakistani cross to the chem
[29:07.880 --> 29:09.520]  special reserve.
[29:09.520 --> 29:12.160]  And now this, this may or may not be,
[29:12.160 --> 29:16.160]  it's close to pre 2000. It may not be quite there,
[29:16.160 --> 29:18.440]  but this is,
[29:18.440 --> 29:22.040]  those are the parents of some of like the strains of today
[29:22.040 --> 29:25.880]  that we see like oil spill, for example, came from,
[29:25.880 --> 29:30.000]  I know that, that the, the Woodman Canyon sour was,
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.480]  was a part of that, that oil spill combo.
[29:32.480 --> 29:33.880]  So, I mean,
[29:33.880 --> 29:36.760]  that's a pack where like it's got some,
[29:36.760 --> 29:38.240]  it's got some heritage to it.
[29:38.240 --> 29:40.640]  And it was, it was really cool to come across.
[29:42.840 --> 29:44.560]  That's some good stuff there.
[29:46.880 --> 29:50.080]  78 Pakistani or the 86 Hindu.
[29:50.080 --> 29:53.480]  I mean, those two cuts are, are about as, I mean,
[29:53.480 --> 29:55.720]  other than like big red, for example,
[29:55.720 --> 29:58.320]  the big red Afghani up there in NorCal,
[29:58.320 --> 30:00.720]  which is guarded like, like Fort Knox.
[30:03.480 --> 30:06.480]  It's, you know, those, that's a, that's a cool,
[30:06.560 --> 30:10.400]  a cool cross there that was, you know, that's, that I've,
[30:10.400 --> 30:12.680]  I've, you know, now been holding onto for a little while,
[30:12.680 --> 30:14.760]  but was from a very good friend of mine.
[30:14.760 --> 30:18.560]  And I mean, that's a, that's got some,
[30:18.560 --> 30:20.920]  got some history to it for sure.
[30:20.920 --> 30:23.760]  Are those things that you could actually find in seed form
[30:23.760 --> 30:27.840]  or is like the fabled one, a cut that's going around?
[30:27.840 --> 30:31.920]  So these, this is seed form, but those,
[30:31.920 --> 30:34.200]  I don't even think I, you know, you'd have to,
[30:34.200 --> 30:37.560]  you'd have to ask like the old, old dudes,
[30:37.560 --> 30:39.960]  if they have any of that and they're not giving it out.
[30:39.960 --> 30:44.440]  So I would say, you know, you pick your winner out of,
[30:44.440 --> 30:48.160]  out of a pack of, let me see, there's probably like,
[30:48.160 --> 30:49.520]  I mean, they're big seeds too.
[30:49.520 --> 30:54.360]  They're probably like 10, 12 in there and you, you know,
[30:54.360 --> 30:56.080]  see, see what you get out of them.
[30:57.440 --> 30:58.280]  Yeah.
[31:00.120 --> 31:03.680]  Those, yeah, the, the Northern California Hills has a lot,
[31:04.760 --> 31:06.200]  a lot of history.
[31:06.200 --> 31:08.160]  They're not letting it out anytime soon.
[31:08.160 --> 31:10.040]  So no.
[31:10.040 --> 31:12.680]  And that's, you know, that's an interesting thing.
[31:12.680 --> 31:13.800]  Well, you know,
[31:13.800 --> 31:16.240]  we definitely want to show off some more seeds here.
[31:16.240 --> 31:17.840]  We will, but we were,
[31:17.840 --> 31:20.680]  we're also talking earlier about how some of these rarer
[31:20.680 --> 31:25.080]  seeds are really what can lead to craft cannabis and like
[31:25.080 --> 31:29.960]  the success of a craft cannabis business, something,
[31:29.960 --> 31:31.320]  you know, I'd love to do.
[31:31.320 --> 31:32.680]  I think, you know,
[31:32.720 --> 31:34.640]  probably both of you guys would like to do James.
[31:34.640 --> 31:37.520]  You're actually in the process of doing it,
[31:37.520 --> 31:40.880]  but it's like the old days, you know, when the OG, you know,
[31:40.880 --> 31:43.440]  the Kush, it was guarded so tight because, well,
[31:43.440 --> 31:45.360]  that's what brought everybody to you.
[31:45.360 --> 31:49.120]  So it didn't get out and it's kind of, I don't know.
[31:49.120 --> 31:52.000]  How do you see some of these collector seeds playing into
[31:52.000 --> 31:54.800]  that as far as like benefiting the craft grower,
[31:54.800 --> 31:55.960]  but at the same time,
[31:55.960 --> 31:59.000]  not necessarily getting out to the public because that's
[31:59.000 --> 32:01.880]  what keeps it out of the hands of burner.
[32:02.720 --> 32:04.280]  Mainstream cannabis.
[32:06.360 --> 32:08.600]  Well, I mean, I think that really,
[32:08.600 --> 32:13.600]  one of the best things that you can do is, you know,
[32:13.600 --> 32:15.840]  you have your community of people,
[32:15.840 --> 32:18.880]  the people that you trust people that, that you say,
[32:18.880 --> 32:22.280]  Hey man, this is, you know, I'm giving this to you.
[32:22.280 --> 32:24.480]  You know, I, I trust that you'll respect that.
[32:24.480 --> 32:26.000]  It's not, you know, you can,
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.240]  you can go ahead and cross it and put it into what, you know,
[32:28.240 --> 32:29.840]  put it into something for yourself.
[32:29.840 --> 32:31.440]  And for, you know, if you,
[32:31.440 --> 32:34.160]  if you find something that's really unique and across that
[32:34.160 --> 32:37.000]  you make with, with it, that's one thing.
[32:37.920 --> 32:41.600]  But I think it's really important that it comes out in,
[32:41.600 --> 32:45.880]  in the right way without being without, as you said,
[32:45.880 --> 32:49.440]  being just rolled up into a big portfolio of one of these
[32:49.440 --> 32:52.560]  big cannabis companies who can, you know,
[32:52.560 --> 32:56.080]  offer up X amount of money basically for whatever they want.
[32:56.080 --> 32:58.360]  And, you know, I think though,
[32:58.360 --> 32:59.640]  one of the things that this,
[32:59.640 --> 33:03.280]  this community really does well is, you know,
[33:03.280 --> 33:04.800]  of course everyone wants to get, you know,
[33:04.800 --> 33:06.960]  everyone would love to have a million dollars on the table
[33:06.960 --> 33:08.480]  and whatever else, and that's great and all,
[33:08.480 --> 33:12.080]  but I see a lot of respect and I see a lot of people who
[33:12.080 --> 33:15.360]  hold this plant too dear to be like, Oh yeah,
[33:15.360 --> 33:17.200]  I'm just going to give this up all, you know,
[33:17.200 --> 33:20.280]  this hard work or these seeds that I have, you know,
[33:20.280 --> 33:22.960]  held onto preciously.
[33:22.960 --> 33:23.800]  And I'm not,
[33:23.800 --> 33:26.360]  I'm not going to give that up simply because somebody puts a
[33:26.360 --> 33:27.640]  check in front of my face.
[33:27.680 --> 33:29.040]  I care too much about it.
[33:30.120 --> 33:33.240]  So I, but at the same time, you know,
[33:33.240 --> 33:36.200]  it is really important to find certain crosses and stuff
[33:36.200 --> 33:40.000]  that we can get out there to help consumers and patients
[33:40.000 --> 33:42.360]  alike. I, you know,
[33:42.360 --> 33:45.320]  that's one of our biggest things is, you know,
[33:45.320 --> 33:48.680]  our head grower is somebody who is one of the,
[33:48.680 --> 33:51.600]  one of the single best grower breeders in,
[33:51.600 --> 33:53.480]  in the world that I've ever seen.
[33:53.480 --> 33:56.160]  And his work is he,
[33:56.160 --> 34:00.920]  he is bringing all new work to our marketplace.
[34:00.920 --> 34:03.760]  And that's a huge part of who we are as a company,
[34:03.760 --> 34:07.960]  because we want to be able to match the profiles that work
[34:07.960 --> 34:10.520]  for our consumers and patients.
[34:10.520 --> 34:13.240]  We are working for them at the end of the day,
[34:13.240 --> 34:15.440]  and we want to make sure that they are getting what they
[34:15.440 --> 34:16.280]  need.
[34:17.200 --> 34:20.200]  And we will go to the ends of the earth to do that.
[34:20.200 --> 34:22.920]  And that's exactly what craft cannabis is all about is
[34:23.360 --> 34:25.840]  putting in 24 hours a day,
[34:25.840 --> 34:29.200]  making sure everything is locked down and is taken care of
[34:29.200 --> 34:31.080]  as well as possible.
[34:31.080 --> 34:33.920]  And, and we are using the genetics that,
[34:33.920 --> 34:37.800]  that have been heirloomed and passed down and are really,
[34:37.800 --> 34:38.640]  you know,
[34:38.640 --> 34:40.920]  you're not just going to find in a seed bank or something
[34:40.920 --> 34:42.640]  like that.
[34:42.640 --> 34:43.480]  It's,
[34:43.480 --> 34:45.760]  it's really important to make sure that these get out there
[34:45.760 --> 34:49.480]  to people and are grown in a way that are going to allow
[34:49.480 --> 34:53.240]  those terpenes and cannabinoid profiles to really hit the
[34:53.240 --> 34:57.480]  market and allow people to really get back to enjoying
[34:57.480 --> 34:58.600]  cannabis flower,
[34:58.600 --> 35:01.320]  rather than going to a dispensary and just getting
[35:01.320 --> 35:04.120]  frustrated because they're like, look, this,
[35:04.120 --> 35:05.980]  this stuff isn't doing it for me.
[35:05.980 --> 35:06.960]  It's crappy.
[35:06.960 --> 35:10.520]  I can go down the street to my body and get better stuff.
[35:10.520 --> 35:12.600]  Yeah. I mean, just simply put.
[35:14.120 --> 35:15.200]  Good to hear man.
[35:15.200 --> 35:16.640]  And you know, people,
[35:16.640 --> 35:18.480]  people are definitely supporting that.
[35:18.480 --> 35:19.960]  Well said James bar,
[35:19.960 --> 35:22.040]  something we like to say around here on this channel is
[35:22.040 --> 35:23.320]  we're dropping gold bars.
[35:23.320 --> 35:28.120]  So burn show knows what's going on with dropping some bars,
[35:28.120 --> 35:30.120]  but you know, it's true.
[35:30.120 --> 35:31.400]  Like I,
[35:31.400 --> 35:35.440]  I enjoy my flower and you know, again,
[35:35.440 --> 35:38.920]  nothing against concentrates or people who dab,
[35:38.920 --> 35:43.800]  but I'm hesitant sometimes to give people my flower because
[35:43.800 --> 35:47.840]  I know that they're primarily interested in dabbing.
[35:47.840 --> 35:50.880]  And it's like, I could give this to them,
[35:50.880 --> 35:53.400]  but is any one of them ever going to be like, whoa, man,
[35:53.400 --> 35:54.440]  that was super powerful.
[35:54.440 --> 35:55.760]  It knocked me on my ass.
[35:55.760 --> 35:56.960]  Yeah, sure.
[35:56.960 --> 35:59.520]  They may enjoy it, but it's a little bit different.
[35:59.520 --> 36:04.360]  I, I enjoy much more giving it to medicinal patients,
[36:04.360 --> 36:06.520]  trying to unlock that key.
[36:06.520 --> 36:07.880]  Kind of like you're saying,
[36:08.920 --> 36:10.720]  trying some of these more, you know,
[36:10.720 --> 36:14.320]  exotic Zaza type strains,
[36:14.320 --> 36:17.000]  they have different cannabinoid ratios.
[36:17.040 --> 36:20.200]  They have different terpenes and who knows one of them just
[36:20.200 --> 36:23.160]  might be the key for somebody's endocannabinoid system.
[36:23.160 --> 36:26.920]  So that is another bonus about being a collector about
[36:26.920 --> 36:28.720]  having some of the rare things.
[36:29.560 --> 36:33.320]  If you're orientated or if your goal is kind of, you know,
[36:33.320 --> 36:36.760]  healing it's fuck dude, I'd rather have, you know,
[36:36.760 --> 36:38.320]  the big box of Crayolas.
[36:39.840 --> 36:41.000]  Yeah, totally.
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  There'll always be a niche for that rare,
[36:46.040 --> 36:50.440]  a cool exotic strain that's out there for the,
[36:50.440 --> 36:53.320]  the people who want that.
[36:53.320 --> 36:55.800]  Like there'll always be a market for it.
[36:55.800 --> 36:56.880]  Maybe a small market.
[36:56.880 --> 36:59.160]  It's not going to be a burner market,
[36:59.160 --> 37:01.600]  but there's always going to be a market for people who want
[37:01.600 --> 37:02.600]  the best of the best.
[37:04.160 --> 37:05.480]  Yeah. And craft too.
[37:05.480 --> 37:08.280]  Craft isn't going to be able to supply the, you know,
[37:08.280 --> 37:09.600]  that large of a market.
[37:09.600 --> 37:10.840]  You just can't do it.
[37:10.840 --> 37:12.480]  So it's, yeah, it's,
[37:12.480 --> 37:14.400]  it's cool if you're able to build your niche there.
[37:14.560 --> 37:16.840]  Yeah. You're just going to carve out your niche basically.
[37:16.840 --> 37:17.840]  And you're going to, you know,
[37:17.840 --> 37:20.520]  you're going to make that work and not, you know,
[37:20.520 --> 37:22.720]  not interested in building an empire, you know,
[37:22.720 --> 37:25.560]  interested in building a legacy brand is the,
[37:25.560 --> 37:26.920]  is the difference there.
[37:26.920 --> 37:29.800]  And just having people know that, hey,
[37:29.800 --> 37:33.720]  when they see our logo on something, the reason it's, you know,
[37:33.720 --> 37:36.840]  the reason it's put in that store is because it is the best
[37:36.840 --> 37:38.240]  of the best and we're not going to let it,
[37:38.240 --> 37:41.160]  we're not going to let it out of our facility unless it is
[37:41.160 --> 37:42.120]  simple as that.
[37:43.040 --> 37:45.480]  Integrity is a good thing to have.
[37:45.480 --> 37:47.000]  Yep. Yes, sir.
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.760]  And there seems to be a lot more people than we may have
[37:50.760 --> 37:52.160]  think in this industry with it.
[37:52.160 --> 37:53.160]  So that's always a plus.
[37:53.160 --> 37:54.000]  Absolutely.
[37:54.000 --> 37:55.400]  I'm meeting new people daily.
[37:55.400 --> 37:56.240]  So it's, it's cool.
[37:56.240 --> 38:00.440]  I mean, to be honest, one guy that we, that, that Dave
[38:00.440 --> 38:05.120]  brought up just, just at the start of our, our session here,
[38:05.120 --> 38:09.120]  that does some amazing work for those who are sitting
[38:09.120 --> 38:11.600]  watching this or may watch it later.
[38:12.400 --> 38:16.600]  And are looking for that more unique cannabinoid, you know,
[38:16.600 --> 38:20.520]  work out there is none other than Seattle chronic.
[38:20.520 --> 38:22.600]  And his stuff is,
[38:22.600 --> 38:27.600]  he is doing weeps and bounds work for all sorts of CBD,
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.720]  CBG, one-to-one ratios of things.
[38:33.600 --> 38:35.360]  And also just honestly,
[38:35.360 --> 38:39.000]  one of the nicest people in this community bar none
[38:39.000 --> 38:40.320]  and works is bought off.
[38:40.320 --> 38:44.120]  So, you know, that what you're getting from him is,
[38:44.120 --> 38:45.240]  is the real deal.
[38:45.240 --> 38:49.880]  And, and it's, it's, I can tell you that as somebody who is,
[38:49.880 --> 38:51.840]  I have a chronic neuromuscular disease.
[38:51.840 --> 38:55.360]  So I am somebody that is always looking for what strains
[38:55.360 --> 38:58.600]  going to work for me, you know, which ones are, and,
[38:58.600 --> 38:59.840]  you know, his stuff is,
[38:59.840 --> 39:02.320]  is one of those that always kind of,
[39:02.320 --> 39:05.080]  whenever I come across his flower, it's,
[39:05.080 --> 39:07.040]  it's something that, that does work for me.
[39:07.040 --> 39:10.560]  So I, you know, I have a huge,
[39:10.560 --> 39:12.480]  huge amount of respect for him and,
[39:12.480 --> 39:14.400]  and all that he does for sure.
[39:15.520 --> 39:17.120]  Yeah. He's been a cool dude.
[39:17.120 --> 39:19.800]  I've seen him a lot here on the future cannabis project
[39:19.800 --> 39:22.360]  channel. He was actually on episode five.
[39:22.360 --> 39:25.200]  I believe it was episode five of the seed collectors.
[39:25.200 --> 39:26.200]  Nice.
[39:26.200 --> 39:28.040]  Yeah. It was, it was a kind of quick.
[39:28.040 --> 39:32.720]  He, he was just coming back from working all day and then
[39:32.720 --> 39:34.000]  the phone died on us,
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.680]  but Dave had actually pulled out a bunch of Seattle chronic
[39:37.320 --> 39:38.160]  seeds for that show.
[39:38.160 --> 39:41.320]  So, you know, Dave, Dave, I just say we're,
[39:41.320 --> 39:42.640]  we're Bartles and James, man.
[39:42.640 --> 39:45.640]  The show doesn't happen without, without the others.
[39:45.640 --> 39:48.880]  So yeah, Dave, Dave came to the rescue there.
[39:48.880 --> 39:50.160]  That was pretty awesome.
[39:50.160 --> 39:51.640]  That's great.
[39:51.640 --> 39:53.600]  Yeah. And I want to hear from you, Dave,
[39:53.600 --> 39:55.360]  you're you're quiet as usual tonight.
[39:55.360 --> 39:56.960]  Show us something, buddy.
[39:56.960 --> 39:58.160]  Tell us a story.
[39:59.920 --> 40:00.760]  Oh, see, there you go.
[40:00.760 --> 40:01.960]  Oh, there we go.
[40:01.960 --> 40:02.880]  What do we get?
[40:02.880 --> 40:04.200]  Oh, that's good stuff.
[40:04.920 --> 40:06.640]  Okay. So Brian Bosworth,
[40:06.640 --> 40:09.280]  I lived in Seattle during the Bos craze.
[40:09.280 --> 40:11.040]  Brian's Bosworth.
[40:11.040 --> 40:12.200]  Fucking awesome.
[40:13.800 --> 40:16.400]  He's got the, he's got the Beckett and the Melvins, man.
[40:16.400 --> 40:17.280]  That's good stuff.
[40:17.280 --> 40:20.520]  I got a couple of packs of that myself from him and it's,
[40:20.520 --> 40:22.120]  it's good.
[40:22.120 --> 40:22.960]  You know, I actually.
[40:22.960 --> 40:24.440]  Two absolute hitters together combined.
[40:24.440 --> 40:25.640]  Sorry, sorry to interrupt there.
[40:25.640 --> 40:28.600]  Yeah, no, I asked you to talk and then I talked over you.
[40:28.600 --> 40:29.640]  So please go ahead.
[40:30.240 --> 40:34.880]  I tell you though, the Beckett,
[40:34.880 --> 40:37.000]  I absolutely love that cut.
[40:37.000 --> 40:38.720]  It is one of the nastiest,
[40:38.720 --> 40:41.520]  funkiest cuts you could ever come across.
[40:41.520 --> 40:44.120]  Just a great washer.
[40:44.120 --> 40:46.000]  I do have, I do not,
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.680]  I'm not a big fan of taking her 14, you know,
[40:47.680 --> 40:50.560]  13, 14 weeks, but that's, it's worth it.
[40:50.560 --> 40:51.760]  Totally worth it.
[40:51.760 --> 40:54.680]  But the Melvins, what a jumper that Melvins is.
[40:54.680 --> 40:56.000]  Yeah.
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.480]  I love that cut.
[40:57.480 --> 40:58.400]  Yeah.
[40:58.800 --> 41:00.240]  Well, that's something that,
[41:01.520 --> 41:04.440]  on one of the last shows he was saying there was a,
[41:04.440 --> 41:07.120]  cause I'm in Washington and so was he,
[41:07.120 --> 41:09.240]  his genetics are here and there's one company here
[41:09.240 --> 41:10.800]  that's selling the Melvins.
[41:10.800 --> 41:14.840]  And so I actually went into a store last week.
[41:14.840 --> 41:18.800]  My wife wanted to get a cart and I saw it there
[41:18.800 --> 41:21.480]  and I was so tempted.
[41:21.480 --> 41:24.160]  Like I wanted to try the Melvins, but I just, I knew,
[41:24.160 --> 41:27.080]  I was familiar with the company that grew it
[41:27.080 --> 41:28.760]  and I was, eh.
[41:28.760 --> 41:29.600]  Yeah.
[41:29.600 --> 41:31.760]  I passed on it because I don't want to,
[41:31.760 --> 41:33.120]  again, that's like the runts though,
[41:33.120 --> 41:35.280]  from earlier, you know, in the show, it's like,
[41:35.280 --> 41:37.040]  I've never grown it myself.
[41:37.040 --> 41:40.080]  I don't know anybody in this area personally
[41:40.080 --> 41:41.840]  that has grown it themselves.
[41:41.840 --> 41:45.680]  The real one, okay, we'll just put that out there.
[41:45.680 --> 41:46.520]  The real one.
[41:48.320 --> 41:51.600]  So when I go to the rec store and I've tried the runs,
[41:51.600 --> 41:53.240]  I've never been impressed,
[41:53.240 --> 41:56.400]  but I know that I do not have a good representation of it.
[41:56.440 --> 41:59.360]  So that's another reason why I was kind of like,
[41:59.360 --> 42:02.640]  ah, I do want to try this Melvins and support that work,
[42:02.640 --> 42:06.280]  but I don't want to be disappointed at the same time,
[42:06.280 --> 42:07.840]  not because of the strain.
[42:07.840 --> 42:08.680]  Yep.
[42:10.480 --> 42:13.440]  Shooter, of course you're from Washington, buddy.
[42:13.440 --> 42:16.920]  You actually, yeah, you're by one of the old stores
[42:16.920 --> 42:18.600]  I used to work at.
[42:18.600 --> 42:20.440]  Runts was sponsored by rappers too.
[42:20.440 --> 42:24.400]  Yeah, Runts was a popular one.
[42:25.400 --> 42:26.360]  It was.
[42:26.360 --> 42:29.480]  And then now was it because of the turf profile
[42:29.480 --> 42:31.120]  or was it because it was a good washer?
[42:31.120 --> 42:33.440]  Cause it sure doesn't really yield
[42:33.440 --> 42:36.200]  and it doesn't grow very easily from what I hear.
[42:37.760 --> 42:40.320]  I'd say more the turf profile than anything.
[42:40.320 --> 42:43.160]  And also it was the marketing behind Runts
[42:43.160 --> 42:44.320]  that really got it going.
[42:44.320 --> 42:47.080]  I mean, Runts became its own company.
[42:47.080 --> 42:48.960]  You know, I mean, it was really taken off
[42:48.960 --> 42:53.960]  by a bunch of marketers who were able to establish a,
[42:54.120 --> 42:55.040]  don't get me wrong.
[42:55.040 --> 42:58.520]  There are some really quality cuts of Runts out there.
[42:58.520 --> 43:02.040]  The pink Runts is one that a friend of mine
[43:02.040 --> 43:06.960]  is particularly big on and has an original cut and loves it.
[43:06.960 --> 43:10.320]  But it was something that was a little bit
[43:10.320 --> 43:14.000]  more marketing based than being,
[43:15.760 --> 43:19.880]  but then you see like if Mean Gene's gonna run it,
[43:19.880 --> 43:23.400]  then there's obviously something there.
[43:23.840 --> 43:26.640]  And it does, it has a big, bold turf profile to it.
[43:26.640 --> 43:30.480]  And it can yield a bunch of different phenotypes too.
[43:30.480 --> 43:33.720]  So depending on what you have.
[43:33.720 --> 43:37.240]  So, you know, it's always worth a try, right?
[43:37.240 --> 43:39.520]  I mean, you know, see what happens.
[43:39.520 --> 43:41.000]  Yes, it is.
[43:41.000 --> 43:42.840]  And even with those ones that, you know,
[43:42.840 --> 43:44.960]  I have that say they're Runts,
[43:44.960 --> 43:48.200]  but they're from that Spanish seed company.
[43:48.200 --> 43:49.880]  I know they're not, but you know what?
[43:49.880 --> 43:51.000]  Roll the dice, man.
[43:51.000 --> 43:52.960]  It doesn't mean you're not gonna get something good.
[43:53.520 --> 43:55.160]  You probably will.
[43:56.320 --> 43:59.880]  I had, so the ones that we gave, you know,
[43:59.880 --> 44:01.400]  you gave away that you kind of regret.
[44:01.400 --> 44:05.880]  I had one, it was called Diesel Glue from,
[44:09.640 --> 44:10.480]  it was actually here.
[44:10.480 --> 44:15.360]  I use it for a coaster for my coffee, Cannabia.
[44:15.360 --> 44:18.200]  But it was one of those companies, Diesel Glue.
[44:18.200 --> 44:20.560]  God, can you get any more namey generic
[44:20.600 --> 44:23.360]  than Diesel and Glue?
[44:23.360 --> 44:25.960]  I didn't have high hopes for it, but I popped it.
[44:25.960 --> 44:29.760]  And as it was growing, it was growing a little bit taller,
[44:29.760 --> 44:31.560]  a little bit more internodal length
[44:31.560 --> 44:32.760]  than some of the other things.
[44:32.760 --> 44:34.760]  So I kind of was like, hey, you know,
[44:34.760 --> 44:35.960]  you'll make it through this round,
[44:35.960 --> 44:37.320]  but I probably won't carry you on
[44:37.320 --> 44:39.160]  just because I'm trying to keep everything, you know,
[44:39.160 --> 44:42.560]  as even as I can with the variety that I actually grow.
[44:44.000 --> 44:45.480]  And I did a contest on here
[44:45.480 --> 44:47.880]  and I originally had like 10 of those.
[44:47.880 --> 44:51.400]  And somebody, you know, they answered the trivia question.
[44:51.400 --> 44:53.840]  I was like, ah, let's just load them up with stuff.
[44:53.840 --> 44:55.840]  And usually if I've grown something
[44:55.840 --> 44:59.560]  and it doesn't necessarily fit exactly what I'm looking for,
[44:59.560 --> 45:01.200]  if I have more, I'll give those away
[45:01.200 --> 45:03.000]  if I still think it was good,
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.440]  just because it's not what I'm looking for
[45:04.440 --> 45:05.800]  doesn't mean it's not good.
[45:07.160 --> 45:09.280]  And so I gave six of those away.
[45:09.280 --> 45:12.840]  I have three left, but I gave six of those away.
[45:12.840 --> 45:14.920]  And when it came time to harvest that thing,
[45:14.920 --> 45:19.920]  I was like, oh my God, why did I not take a clone of this?
[45:19.960 --> 45:22.960]  Why did I not, you know, why did I give those away?
[45:23.960 --> 45:25.520]  It was a happy surprise.
[45:25.520 --> 45:27.840]  I do not get any sort of diesel out of it.
[45:27.840 --> 45:30.400]  I do not get any sort of glue out of it,
[45:30.400 --> 45:34.400]  but it was a fricking fantastic strain.
[45:34.400 --> 45:37.400]  So that's one that I gave away that I was probably like,
[45:37.400 --> 45:39.600]  no, wish I had all of them to go through
[45:39.600 --> 45:41.760]  and see if I can get that exact thing back.
[45:42.760 --> 45:46.360]  I always be cloning.
[45:46.360 --> 45:48.520]  Always be cloning.
[45:48.520 --> 45:49.960]  ABC man.
[45:49.960 --> 45:54.480]  I usually, I'm 99% on that.
[45:54.480 --> 45:56.600]  That is like one of probably two
[45:56.600 --> 45:59.600]  that I haven't like automatically cloned.
[45:59.600 --> 46:04.600]  But what are, maybe what are one of the readers or packs
[46:05.520 --> 46:07.400]  that each of you could pull out from somebody
[46:07.400 --> 46:09.200]  that we probably don't know,
[46:09.200 --> 46:11.440]  that we probably haven't heard of yet.
[46:12.120 --> 46:14.640]  And can you maybe tell us a little bit about that breeder
[46:14.640 --> 46:17.800]  or, you know, that strain and maybe why it,
[46:17.800 --> 46:20.800]  why you chose it or how it came to you?
[46:20.800 --> 46:22.640]  Because again, we want to represent, you know,
[46:22.640 --> 46:25.280]  everybody that we can.
[46:25.280 --> 46:27.720]  And it's such a big community that there's some all-stars
[46:27.720 --> 46:29.720]  out there that we've never heard of.
[46:29.720 --> 46:30.800]  Oh, absolutely.
[46:30.800 --> 46:32.080]  Yeah.
[46:32.080 --> 46:34.000]  I mean, you know, to be honest,
[46:34.920 --> 46:38.720]  I know that I'm pretty sure Dave knows who he is,
[46:38.720 --> 46:40.720]  but for the most part,
[46:41.040 --> 46:43.840]  he's somebody that really kind of sticks to himself
[46:43.840 --> 46:48.360]  and truly makes some of the best genetics out there.
[46:50.680 --> 46:54.480]  And really the only times you find them is he's so generous
[46:54.480 --> 46:56.360]  when it comes to charity auctions.
[46:56.360 --> 46:59.120]  That's when he really puts his stuff in there
[46:59.120 --> 47:01.480]  and that is melting pot farms.
[47:02.720 --> 47:07.720]  And Melty is just one of the best guys out there.
[47:08.720 --> 47:13.720]  His, this is a 50 plus pack right here
[47:15.320 --> 47:16.880]  of his coastal collision,
[47:16.880 --> 47:21.760]  which is just, it's one of the best strains
[47:21.760 --> 47:24.960]  that I've truly ever grown.
[47:24.960 --> 47:29.840]  It's a Saladine cross with a crazy SFV back cross.
[47:30.880 --> 47:33.320]  His stuff is, you know,
[47:33.320 --> 47:35.680]  you'll see his stuff on charity auctions and stuff
[47:35.680 --> 47:37.920]  go for an absolute fortune.
[47:37.920 --> 47:40.960]  And then there are times where he's just like,
[47:40.960 --> 47:43.440]  he's like, oh, I'm sorry, I'm a week late with this,
[47:43.440 --> 47:45.360]  so I'm gonna throw in an extra 30 seeds
[47:45.360 --> 47:46.360]  or something like that.
[47:46.360 --> 47:49.320]  And you're like, oh, okay, thanks, man.
[47:49.320 --> 47:52.720]  Like, you're just a good dude who does, you know,
[47:52.720 --> 47:54.600]  you do your own thing and I love it.
[47:54.600 --> 47:59.360]  And I, yeah, he is not only for being an incredible
[48:00.440 --> 48:05.240]  seed breeder, but also for being just such a good person.
[48:05.640 --> 48:10.440]  And really helping a lot of people out there who know him.
[48:10.440 --> 48:13.520]  And he turns up in a pinch to help people out.
[48:13.520 --> 48:17.600]  And so really, again, just a top notch guy.
[48:18.960 --> 48:20.680]  Cool, well, thank you for sharing that one.
[48:20.680 --> 48:24.400]  And, you know, take note of that and everybody in chat,
[48:24.400 --> 48:26.680]  you know, again, some of those things we see
[48:26.680 --> 48:30.840]  because we do almost get jaded or like, you know,
[48:30.840 --> 48:33.560]  the, for lack of a better term,
[48:33.600 --> 48:36.320]  Instagram breeders are a dime a dozen.
[48:36.320 --> 48:41.080]  So it's hard to recognize those gems in the sea of,
[48:41.080 --> 48:43.760]  you know, just like bedazzled genes.
[48:43.760 --> 48:44.880]  Absolutely.
[48:45.920 --> 48:47.680]  So thanks for pointing that one out.
[48:47.680 --> 48:48.640]  How about you, Dave?
[48:48.640 --> 48:50.600]  What do you have from someone
[48:50.600 --> 48:53.000]  that we might not have heard from?
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.760]  I'm a big fan of someone by the name of Two Tone
[48:56.760 --> 48:58.840]  out of the Pacific Northwest.
[48:59.800 --> 49:03.320]  He's got some absolutely fire stuff out there.
[49:04.080 --> 49:05.880]  If you ever want to find him on Instagram,
[49:05.880 --> 49:07.360]  that some of the frostiest plants,
[49:07.360 --> 49:10.200]  they rival some of the seed junkies plants out there.
[49:10.200 --> 49:12.240]  I'm telling you, it's just absolute fire,
[49:12.240 --> 49:13.480]  the stuff he works with.
[49:13.480 --> 49:16.320]  Really, really hard to get his drops.
[49:16.320 --> 49:17.240]  Really hard.
[49:17.240 --> 49:21.040]  Not a lot of his stuff is ever really released.
[49:21.040 --> 49:26.000]  I only happen to get these from donating to a Discord server
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.320]  that he's a big part of,
[49:27.320 --> 49:30.440]  the NW47 Lemon Opos Discord server.
[49:30.440 --> 49:31.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[49:31.600 --> 49:33.760]  I got in touch with how I found him
[49:33.760 --> 49:38.000]  and just everybody would rave about him on there.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.160]  So you hear things, it's like, okay,
[49:40.160 --> 49:41.280]  maybe then you see them.
[49:41.280 --> 49:43.000]  It's like, wow, it's okay.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.200]  I see what everyone's talking about.
[49:45.200 --> 49:47.760]  And I will pop this stuff eventually.
[49:47.760 --> 49:48.640]  I haven't yet.
[49:48.640 --> 49:53.640]  I know I'm guilty of that a lot, but in time, in time.
[49:54.680 --> 49:56.480]  There's only so much room, man.
[49:56.480 --> 49:57.960]  So much room.
[49:57.960 --> 50:00.160]  You're gonna get through that list one day.
[50:02.040 --> 50:03.480]  One day, man.
[50:05.040 --> 50:07.800]  Yeah, just throwing one more up there for people
[50:07.800 --> 50:11.480]  because I know right now he has been selling
[50:11.480 --> 50:15.760]  a whole bunch of absolute fire projects
[50:15.760 --> 50:18.920]  that are just like, I cannot tell you
[50:18.920 --> 50:22.480]  how much everyone needs to double down on him.
[50:22.480 --> 50:27.480]  Is if you go to Ozark Nation's breeding or IG page,
[50:28.440 --> 50:31.320]  it's Ozark Nation.
[50:31.320 --> 50:34.880]  Here is one of his that he had personally given to me.
[50:34.880 --> 50:36.920]  This was the Mendo Breath Cherry Limeade
[50:38.680 --> 50:39.720]  that I got from him.
[50:39.720 --> 50:42.720]  But right now he has some incredible
[50:42.720 --> 50:44.600]  black lime crosses going.
[50:44.600 --> 50:47.880]  He has the Sky Cutler Double Kush going.
[50:48.960 --> 50:53.960]  He runs a lot of, he works his own cuts
[50:54.240 --> 50:55.960]  into everything beautifully.
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.320]  And honestly, the results from those are,
[51:00.320 --> 51:02.400]  they're some of the best I've ever seen
[51:02.400 --> 51:05.000]  off of any breeder, period.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.560]  And I think right now, honestly,
[51:06.560 --> 51:09.440]  he's charging like 50 bucks a pack or something.
[51:09.440 --> 51:10.600]  Those are them right there.
[51:10.600 --> 51:13.120]  He's got it going down right there.
[51:14.160 --> 51:15.760]  Nepali.
[51:16.720 --> 51:20.800]  His Nepali plant is one of the best plants around for sure.
[51:21.640 --> 51:22.960]  Wow.
[51:22.960 --> 51:27.880]  So the Nepali, is that like a short Indica leaner
[51:27.880 --> 51:31.360]  or is it a tall sativa leaning plant?
[51:31.360 --> 51:32.320]  Nepal's.
[51:32.320 --> 51:33.160]  The Nepali.
[51:33.160 --> 51:34.480]  It's a Nepali hash plant.
[51:34.480 --> 51:35.960]  It's a Nepali hash plant.
[51:35.960 --> 51:39.440]  So yeah, I mean, it comes from the same,
[51:39.440 --> 51:44.200]  a lot of the, a very similar cut to what Bodhi has.
[51:44.200 --> 51:45.800]  His is a bit different.
[51:46.800 --> 51:51.800]  And honestly, it packs on the weight, like mill of business.
[51:54.000 --> 51:57.600]  So yeah, he always sends so much love
[51:57.600 --> 51:59.080]  to people around him too.
[51:59.080 --> 52:03.360]  Like, you know, he probably sent half of those as freebies
[52:03.360 --> 52:04.560]  to Dave, to be honest.
[52:04.560 --> 52:05.400]  So.
[52:06.400 --> 52:07.920]  I'm just cracking up over here.
[52:07.920 --> 52:11.000]  It's like, does it stop?
[52:11.000 --> 52:12.000]  Those are some J's.
[52:13.400 --> 52:15.080]  He's just one of the best guys around.
[52:15.400 --> 52:17.880]  And I would thoroughly tell anybody who's like,
[52:17.880 --> 52:21.280]  huh, what's a reasonably priced pack of seeds out there?
[52:21.280 --> 52:24.960]  And he'll also hook you up is definitely Ozark.
[52:24.960 --> 52:27.920]  So that would be one to write down
[52:27.920 --> 52:30.720]  and get on over there to talk to him.
[52:30.720 --> 52:31.560]  Nice.
[52:31.560 --> 52:35.680]  Now, are you guys familiar with where he sources
[52:35.680 --> 52:38.360]  some of these plants or is he kind of like
[52:38.360 --> 52:41.200]  the older person themselves that may have been
[52:41.200 --> 52:44.560]  holding onto these since the glory days?
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.360]  So, I mean, a lot of it is from, I mean,
[52:47.360 --> 52:50.360]  he's been in the breeding game for a long time.
[52:50.360 --> 52:53.600]  He's lived in Oregon.
[52:53.600 --> 52:57.600]  He's worked with a lot of really big time breeders.
[52:58.560 --> 53:01.560]  He does, he's very close with Mean Gene.
[53:02.720 --> 53:05.960]  That's where some of those starter cuts came from.
[53:05.960 --> 53:08.640]  But he also has just amassed his own work
[53:08.640 --> 53:11.440]  as time has gone on.
[53:11.480 --> 53:14.640]  And, you know, like right now he's got this
[53:14.640 --> 53:19.640]  outstanding Mario G that was an Irene Kush phenotype
[53:21.960 --> 53:24.760]  that came from a buddy of his down South.
[53:24.760 --> 53:27.960]  And I mean, it is one of the most beautiful
[53:27.960 --> 53:30.040]  OG plants I've ever seen.
[53:30.040 --> 53:33.160]  I got to run it recently and I just,
[53:33.160 --> 53:34.440]  I fell in love with it.
[53:34.440 --> 53:38.760]  So, I mean, he really pulls a lot of winners, man.
[53:38.800 --> 53:40.960]  That's the best way to say it is,
[53:40.960 --> 53:43.880]  is he's just kind of a golden ticket that way.
[53:44.840 --> 53:47.640]  He's got the golden touch there.
[53:47.640 --> 53:50.520]  So what about it was it that, you know,
[53:50.520 --> 53:52.480]  you love that made you just kind of an awe?
[53:52.480 --> 53:53.840]  Was it the morphology?
[53:53.840 --> 53:55.800]  Was it, you know, something afterwards,
[53:55.800 --> 53:57.680]  like the effects or the profile?
[53:57.680 --> 53:59.600]  I mean, I think to start with,
[53:59.600 --> 54:04.400]  it was just the terpene profile coming off of it,
[54:04.400 --> 54:07.160]  especially like, for example, Dave right there
[54:07.160 --> 54:10.200]  has that grape soda skunk crossed with cherry limeade.
[54:10.200 --> 54:13.760]  That grape soda skunk has some of the most killer
[54:13.760 --> 54:15.720]  terpenes you have ever,
[54:17.440 --> 54:20.160]  you have ever smelled in your entire life.
[54:20.160 --> 54:23.480]  And it, the cannabinoids that came off of it too
[54:23.480 --> 54:25.240]  were really medically healing.
[54:25.240 --> 54:29.400]  I was very impressed with the grape soda
[54:29.400 --> 54:33.520]  that I have run from him crossed with cherry limeade.
[54:33.520 --> 54:35.760]  I also have had one that's been crossed with
[54:37.760 --> 54:39.000]  was it crossed with, was it the,
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.760]  I think it was the Zoz pollen that he had.
[54:41.760 --> 54:46.360]  And so, I mean, just like absolute terp monsters.
[54:46.360 --> 54:50.640]  He also does some crazy washing strains as well
[54:50.640 --> 54:54.280]  that are, you know, a couple of those right down there,
[54:54.280 --> 54:58.240]  for example, are some awesome washing stuff.
[54:58.240 --> 55:01.280]  So he kind of hits all the points.
[55:02.240 --> 55:06.600]  The morphology of the plants are really consistent
[55:06.960 --> 55:09.960]  and that's something else that I really like is that,
[55:09.960 --> 55:12.640]  while, you know, it's not like he endlessly tests,
[55:12.640 --> 55:13.960]  but at the same time, man,
[55:13.960 --> 55:17.480]  they come out like just gorgeous every time.
[55:17.480 --> 55:20.480]  And the germination rate is, I mean,
[55:20.480 --> 55:22.360]  if you're not getting about, you know,
[55:22.360 --> 55:24.280]  he'll throw like 12, 15 seeds in there.
[55:24.280 --> 55:27.080]  If you're not getting like almost every single one of them,
[55:27.080 --> 55:28.280]  except maybe one,
[55:28.280 --> 55:30.200]  he's probably gonna throw you another pack.
[55:30.200 --> 55:31.040]  Wow.
[55:31.040 --> 55:32.680]  Like, because he's just, he is that, you know,
[55:32.680 --> 55:34.360]  sure in his craft and his ability.
[55:34.360 --> 55:37.400]  So yeah, I'll, you know,
[55:37.400 --> 55:39.880]  I'll stop with the paid promotion over here.
[55:39.880 --> 55:40.720]  No, no, no.
[55:40.720 --> 55:43.040]  But I couldn't help, but kind of throw that in there.
[55:43.040 --> 55:45.520]  Cause I know Dave is a big fan of his as well.
[55:46.520 --> 55:47.440]  Yeah.
[55:47.440 --> 55:49.280]  I asked, go ahead, Dave.
[55:49.280 --> 55:52.000]  Oh, I was just, just commenting that I love that guy.
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.360]  It's funny that we were talking about the grape soda skunk.
[55:54.360 --> 55:57.840]  I actually saw Mean Gene posting earlier today
[55:57.840 --> 56:00.520]  about how he's running the F9s of it right now.
[56:00.520 --> 56:02.520]  And that he's got, he's seeing wonderful things from it.
[56:03.240 --> 56:05.600]  What he's, he said he put 70 of them out there.
[56:05.600 --> 56:06.440]  Yeah.
[56:06.440 --> 56:07.400]  That's, yep, he did.
[56:08.640 --> 56:10.200]  Wow.
[56:10.200 --> 56:11.680]  And this is the older,
[56:11.680 --> 56:13.720]  one of the older versions of the grape soda skunk.
[56:13.720 --> 56:15.120]  Cause I was asking him about it.
[56:15.120 --> 56:18.880]  We could ask Ozark.
[56:18.880 --> 56:20.520]  I think you're right, Dave.
[56:20.520 --> 56:22.640]  I want to say it's like the, like a,
[56:22.640 --> 56:26.160]  maybe an F, like F6 or an F, you know, I mean,
[56:26.160 --> 56:29.440]  it's definitely older and it's very unique.
[56:30.280 --> 56:31.120]  Yeah.
[56:31.120 --> 56:33.400]  I actually, when, when speaking to Jackson about it,
[56:33.400 --> 56:35.040]  he, he mentioned, he's like, yeah,
[56:35.040 --> 56:36.000]  it's going to be totally different
[56:36.000 --> 56:37.360]  from what I'm working now.
[56:37.360 --> 56:39.840]  Like what I have now is nothing like that grape soda skunk
[56:39.840 --> 56:41.000]  that he was working with.
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  How cool is that?
[56:42.000 --> 56:42.840]  Right?
[56:44.720 --> 56:45.560]  Cool.
[56:45.560 --> 56:47.040]  It's, it's interesting though,
[56:47.040 --> 56:50.600]  when things change the profile, but retain the name,
[56:50.600 --> 56:52.840]  that's something that I'm kind of thinking about
[56:52.840 --> 56:54.600]  or dealing with right now.
[56:54.600 --> 56:57.440]  One, I'm really curious about the terpene profile
[56:57.440 --> 56:58.600]  from that grape soda skunk.
[56:58.600 --> 57:00.040]  Cause I'm doing a lot of stuff
[57:00.040 --> 57:01.760]  with the Westport's grape juice.
[57:03.160 --> 57:04.520]  You know, as it's growing,
[57:04.520 --> 57:07.120]  it has just like a super strong,
[57:07.120 --> 57:10.280]  like carnival candy grape to it.
[57:11.720 --> 57:16.720]  As it matures, as it cures, it's creamy.
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  It has like, oh God, like a creamy wine grape
[57:22.200 --> 57:23.720]  that has a little bit of that,
[57:23.720 --> 57:25.720]  like purple grape taste to it.
[57:25.760 --> 57:28.840]  It's not as carnival candy as the smell.
[57:28.840 --> 57:30.920]  And then as you exhale,
[57:30.920 --> 57:33.160]  you actually get a little bit of gas on the back end
[57:33.160 --> 57:35.520]  that just wasn't there when you smelled it
[57:35.520 --> 57:37.720]  or on the inhale, but it comes out that way.
[57:38.720 --> 57:42.040]  And so I'm building a lot of my work off of that.
[57:42.040 --> 57:44.840]  What is the profile of the grape soda skunk?
[57:46.160 --> 57:48.440]  Honestly, it's not, you know,
[57:48.440 --> 57:51.080]  the couple that I've had are, you know,
[57:51.080 --> 57:53.120]  fall in line with something similar to that.
[57:53.120 --> 57:56.920]  It is a very, it's kind of a rich grape soda
[57:56.920 --> 58:01.400]  sort of smelling, but it also does have that skunk in it.
[58:01.400 --> 58:05.720]  There's definitely that, it's not overpowering,
[58:05.720 --> 58:09.240]  it's not crazy, but it might kind of be
[58:09.240 --> 58:11.680]  that sort of back end, what you're talking about.
[58:13.920 --> 58:16.120]  And it could be something that could really work well
[58:16.120 --> 58:18.560]  with the line that you're talking about.
[58:18.560 --> 58:19.720]  Another one that comes to mind
[58:19.720 --> 58:22.240]  that would probably work really nicely with that
[58:22.240 --> 58:26.200]  is Dungeon Vault Genetics, like their brandy wine stuff.
[58:26.200 --> 58:29.720]  I don't know if you're familiar with Dungeon Vault too much,
[58:29.720 --> 58:34.720]  but their stuff was really like, had that grape juice,
[58:36.800 --> 58:41.200]  very much like a, not alcohol-y,
[58:41.200 --> 58:45.760]  but like almost like having a grape juice, essentially,
[58:45.760 --> 58:47.040]  like a Welch's grape juice.
[58:47.040 --> 58:50.360]  So I remember a friend of mine, you know,
[58:50.360 --> 58:52.680]  kept a cut of that because he was so impressed
[58:52.680 --> 58:54.160]  with how unique the smell was.
[58:54.160 --> 58:57.720]  So, I mean, that could be a good way to go with that too,
[58:57.720 --> 59:00.680]  to take the wine a different direction.
[59:00.680 --> 59:02.120]  Yeah, it's interesting,
[59:02.120 --> 59:04.960]  because it's like, craft,
[59:04.960 --> 59:06.840]  you wanna have something unique, something different,
[59:06.840 --> 59:09.160]  and I'm kind of doing some of the work with that.
[59:09.160 --> 59:14.080]  So when I do hear some of these predominant grape strains
[59:14.080 --> 59:16.640]  over the last year or two, I'm always like,
[59:16.640 --> 59:19.140]  so what's the profile on it?
[59:19.140 --> 59:22.020]  Just to see, you know, how close we are.
[59:22.020 --> 59:23.100]  Well, I think we're gonna have to get you
[59:23.100 --> 59:25.580]  some grape soda skunk to cross in there.
[59:25.580 --> 59:29.540]  So you'll have to, I'll either get it from you or from Dave,
[59:29.540 --> 59:31.560]  but we'll be sending you some grape soda
[59:31.560 --> 59:34.140]  so that you can play around with it a little bit
[59:34.140 --> 59:36.060]  and see what you think.
[59:36.060 --> 59:36.900]  Hell yeah.
[59:36.900 --> 59:38.820]  Maybe something like that.
[59:38.820 --> 59:40.300]  Oh, whatever you need.
[59:40.300 --> 59:42.380]  There it is, yeah.
[59:42.380 --> 59:44.500]  Wow, Mean Gene from Minnesota.
[59:44.500 --> 59:46.900]  That looks like a, is that an older pack?
[59:46.900 --> 59:48.420]  No, that's fresh.
[59:49.340 --> 59:51.340]  Oh, the new packs, okay.
[59:53.020 --> 59:55.380]  I guess it might change every season.
[59:55.380 --> 59:56.220]  You know, it's funny, actually,
[59:56.220 --> 59:59.480]  I should say that the new news look like this.
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.980]  Can you please give us a historical timeline
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:06.060]  of the Freeborn Selections packs, Dave?
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.340]  Can we just run that one out?
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.460]  Oh, okay, see, yeah, see, that's what I was thinking.
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.980]  That was, I've seen those.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.900]  I'm hip.
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:20.740]  To be honest with you,
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:23.980]  most of the Mean Gene old school stuff looks,
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:24.820]  there you go.
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:27.380]  Yep, that's it right there, man.
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.580]  Oh man, all right.
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:33.180]  And there's that boy, Ozark, right there.
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.020]  Absolutely.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.100]  That's what lets you know that Ozark
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.580]  was a Mean Gene tester at some point.
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:42.380]  Yes, yep, yep, he's always been one.
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:44.540]  So he knows the stuff.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:47.100]  If Mean Gene trusts him, there you go.
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.740]  Right, that is, that's fascinating
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.660]  when you can make those connections
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:51.700]  and follow that line.
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:52.900]  Because again, yeah, it's like,
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.500]  if you're a tester of Homeboy,
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.260]  and you're, you know, of Mean Gene,
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.000]  and Mean Gene and you are still friends,
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.380]  and you're still doing your thing,
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.140]  and yeah, you know?
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.180]  Absolutely.
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:07.340]  Fire doesn't play with poof too commonly.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:12.340]  What the hell is everyone doing here with me?
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.340]  You're, dude, you're El Fuego.
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:17.940]  What are you throwing down now?
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.700]  Just some more of Ozark's work.
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:22.060]  This is his Black Lime Reserve F2
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:23.780]  that he worked Mean Gene,
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.020]  or Aficionado's Black Lime Reserve.
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:29.040]  How many Black Lime Reserves are there?
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.420]  There's really only the one.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:32.940]  There's pretty much just the one
[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:36.180]  that's just been, it's been taken all over the place.
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.980]  The one that you really want to try though,
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.980]  I'm telling you, because it does,
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.640]  it stands up shoulders above,
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.420]  and in my opinion, that's just me,
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.980]  but is, you know, sending you over
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.060]  some actual, the Black Lime, not the Black Lime Reserve.
[01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.900]  I think the Black Lime Reserve falls a little flat
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:52.060]  to the Black Lime.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:57.060]  So the Black Lime was a Mean Gene special
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:02.420]  that they created the Black Lime Reserve from, essentially.
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.540]  And so it's kind of like the parent
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.540]  to the Black Lime Reserve.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.580]  The Black Lime Reserve was a phenotype to it,
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:13.700]  and it's good.
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:17.220]  I don't know that it, but the Black Lime itself is just,
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:19.700]  it's a very, very nice plant.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:23.300]  I've heard nothing but good things about it.
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:26.100]  And when it's that unanimous,
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.980]  there's usually something special.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:31.420]  Yeah, something, something special about it.
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.300]  Yeah, I remember him saying it was lime,
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:37.140]  but it was so dark, it was so purple
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.820]  that it was almost black.
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.180]  That's what he wrote on the bag.
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.500]  He called it Black Lime.
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:44.620]  So that's what his distinguishing feature
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:47.620]  was it was so dark versus every other pheno of it.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.900]  And that's the one that he hit
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.260]  with the Chemdog Special Reserve,
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:52.660]  or Leo's Chemdog Special Reserve.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:55.580]  That's what became the Black Lime Reserve.
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:58.620]  But like James was saying, the Black Lime is,
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.900]  that's where the flavor's coming from.
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:01.980]  Yeah.
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:02.940]  Nice, nice.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.220]  And again, you guys are both gas guys,
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.340]  but does gas show up in that?
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:17.140]  I mean, it's primarily more along the turpey side.
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:20.740]  You get a hint of some gassy skunk in it.
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.580]  Like I've had it from a couple things,
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:26.060]  but like it doesn't necessarily sit in there,
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:29.820]  but it's such a special plant and it's so good tasting
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.340]  and the smoke just knocks you on your butt.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.580]  So for me, it works out great.
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.180]  I'm happy it's a plant.
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.500]  That's good.
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:43.180]  Yeah, you can't pigeonhole yourself to just one flavor too.
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.580]  I don't think anybody would do that.
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.260]  We all have our preferences, but yeah.
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.700]  That's again, why my tent is a bunch of variety
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.020]  and not monographs.
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.700]  There was the guy who had asked
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.180]  about pre-2000 stuff on there.
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:02.180]  And I just pulled something that definitely fits that.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:06.860]  So these are the original stock,
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:10.020]  Mr. Nice Neville's Haze and Neville's Skunk.
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.500]  What?
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.420]  Right here.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.380]  They're in the old-
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:15.740]  The straws.
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:17.740]  Yeah, the bent straw wraps.
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:19.060]  And- That's great.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:24.580]  Yeah, I mean, Shanti himself actually was like,
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:27.460]  he's like, no, no, no, that's the original stock
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:28.300]  of this stuff.
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:33.300]  And so, yeah, I got those and then I got, let's see.
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:35.260]  Let's see.
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:40.260]  I got his Angel and then his NL5 Haze original stock.
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:42.940]  And then-
[01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:45.020]  Those like belong in a museum somewhere.
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:45.860]  I know, right?
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:48.380]  And then Skunk Haze.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.180]  Wow.
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:51.620]  Super Silver Haze.
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:53.460]  Oh, wow.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.700]  And then let's see, what was the last one?
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.500]  Critical Skunk.
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:00.540]  Damn, those are some gems.
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:02.020]  Yeah, those are some-
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:02.860]  Yeah.
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.740]  Aged gems right there.
[01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.180]  That is awesome.
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:10.580]  It's cool to go back to something that has such a history.
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.020]  I've never seen those before.
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.300]  Yeah, I mean, you know what?
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:15.980]  Again, it's all about the community.
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:17.740]  That's where those came from.
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:21.140]  And to be honest, at some point,
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:23.380]  they're probably gonna go back to the community somewhere
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:27.460]  to have somebody be able to actually do like an OP for them.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:31.060]  And so they can be spread around because some of those,
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:34.660]  I would much rather see those in a bunch of people's hands
[01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:38.580]  and let them explore and see all the variation
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:39.620]  and be able to say,
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:44.380]  hey, I have a piece of these really unique plants
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.820]  that go back X amount of years.
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:51.020]  And I am not a hoarder of some of those.
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.500]  And especially, to be totally honest,
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.300]  haze plants take a long time.
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:59.980]  And so sometimes I don't have the patience
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.020]  for some of the hazes.
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:04.300]  So I need to put those in a person's hand
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.380]  who has a little more patience than I do
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:07.740]  and let him run it.
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:08.580]  Yes.
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.740]  Speaking of things in your hand,
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:11.380]  like how are you able to hold those
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.380]  and not get third degree burns, honestly?
[01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:14.220]  Whew.
[01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.060]  Totally.
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.660]  It's got a special oven mitt to handle those.
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:19.500]  There you go.
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.260]  Yeah, the white gloves come out for that.
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.540]  Oh man, those things.
[01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:24.940]  Yeah, no, those things are special.
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:25.940]  And you said OP,
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:28.980]  which for everybody listening, open pollination.
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.020]  Sorry.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:30.860]  No, you're fine.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:32.060]  I followed.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.780]  But just like seed increases.
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.580]  We all seem to have not enough room
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.300]  just to run the individuals,
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:41.420]  but do you ever do your own seed increases?
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.180]  I have not, personally.
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:47.780]  I have never done anything like that.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:50.300]  Frankly, I don't have the green thumb
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:53.780]  to go through and do all of that as it is.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:57.300]  But I know that there are so many capable growers out there
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:01.260]  that have the skills and ability to keep those alive
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:02.300]  and keep them going.
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:05.780]  And so, I'd love to have somebody come in
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:08.140]  and work with us in our facility
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:10.340]  and be somebody who's just young and hungry
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:13.940]  and wants to take on a big project like that
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.260]  and just be like, hey man, here you go.
[01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:17.220]  You do your thing.
[01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:20.940]  You fuck these plant up and we're all coming for you.
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:23.700]  How about that?
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:24.540]  There you go.
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:26.260]  No pressure, kid, no pressure.
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.060]  Pressure creates diamonds.
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.420]  That's true.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:32.660]  Yes, it does.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:34.940]  Snaps.
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:37.620]  So I keep seeing kind of like when I think of
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.540]  some of the older breeders,
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:41.700]  or at least that have been around
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:42.820]  since I was paying attention,
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.780]  I'm seeing in that upper left-hand corner,
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:46.540]  Brothers Grimm.
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:47.380]  Yes, sir.
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:51.780]  What are you hiding on a pineapple?
[01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:55.300]  So is this like the pina
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.420]  that we're seeing from like Jackson
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:58.780]  or is this a different pineapple?
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:07:59.620]  Different, yeah.
[01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:03.180]  This was a very pineapple,
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:06.140]  turp forward version of Cindy 99.
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:08.700]  That's what this is.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.700]  But this was another one of those gifts from a friend.
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:13.420]  Wonderful guy, but they were all mixed up.
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:14.260]  Great dude.
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:18.060]  But this is just something that he said.
[01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:21.300]  I told him I don't have my Cindy 99.
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:25.660]  I had some Duke Diamonds vault,
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.580]  Cindy 99 S1s,
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.460]  and I don't have them anymore.
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.460]  I don't remember what I did with them.
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:32.300]  I did not.
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:36.380]  He's gonna, oh Jesus,
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:39.420]  I wanna be the person that lives in your house next.
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:42.380]  He's gonna be finding stuff like behind the fridge.
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.220]  Yup, yup.
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.060]  Oh man.
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:45.780]  Pretty much, man.
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:48.740]  Yeah, I got some great Brothers Grimm stuff
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:50.460]  that they've done over the years
[01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:54.060]  of like the Green Avenger that they did,
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:59.980]  which just is a old, old faithful, old, old stuff.
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:03.820]  And then like, these were,
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:08.820]  this was F1s of his original Grimm dog that he did.
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.100]  That honestly, I don't even know the genetics on it,
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:14.460]  to be honest, but that was an old one.
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:17.100]  And then like, I got a couple different Rosetta Stones
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:22.100]  that he did, and then some Cinderella XX as well.
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.460]  So you really can't go wrong with his stuff.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:27.980]  I've had a couple of friends tell me
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:31.300]  that they've been popping a lot of his older gear
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.300]  and it's been just some absolute gems.
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.140]  And this is from people who like,
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:40.260]  they are super picky about what they're growing.
[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:43.620]  So I mean, when you hear gems from them, you're like, okay,
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.140]  you know, you're probably onto something.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.460]  Damn it, another one to add to the list.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.860]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.620]  Yeah, and you know, one thing that I've kind of heard,
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:57.860]  you know, a lot about his gear is just the uniformity
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.620]  of what you're gonna pop.
[01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:01.980]  And when you are running a larger room
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:05.700]  or you are doing it commercial, that's the golden ticket.
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:08.260]  You really kind of demand that
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.160]  in any of the seeds that you see.
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:16.100]  You got, you can't adjust like every single light
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.100]  in a thousand square foot room just for, you know,
[01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.940]  different phenomes.
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:24.860]  He puts so much work just into making Cindy 99 itself.
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:27.860]  Just cubing that, cubing princess,
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:29.660]  working what was it, was it Shiva skunk
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:31.220]  that he put it with?
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:32.060]  Yes.
[01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:33.260]  I can't remember which skunk he put it with,
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.020]  but I'm pretty sure that's what it was.
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:36.220]  And he just kept working down,
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:39.020]  selecting towards the princess, isolating it
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:43.340]  and getting every phenome to be what you want it to be.
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:45.500]  So it's uniform, that's what you're looking for.
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:48.700]  So that's a guy who's definitely put in a lot of work
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.740]  and deserves respect for it.
[01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:52.780]  Nice.
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:54.860]  And now when you mentioned Green Avenger,
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:56.500]  my brain instantly went to this
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:59.220]  and then I see the question from Tyler420,
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:02.500]  Green Avenger is a collab with Subcool TGA
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.660]  because it was team Green Avenger is how I knew TGA.
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:07.740]  So was this really a collab?
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:10.020]  I very well could have been, honestly,
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:12.500]  I'm not totally sure.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.700]  We'd have to look it up.
[01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:17.780]  I know the plants are really, really nice
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:19.420]  is the only thing that I...
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:20.900]  I used to have a second pack of it,
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:24.780]  let a friend pop them and they turned out fantastic.
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:28.340]  But I don't remember if they go back
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:31.180]  to the whole team Green Avenger or not,
[01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:33.300]  but I would assume they probably do.
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:36.340]  Just knowing back in the day,
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:39.180]  like they were both pretty big
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:40.940]  and have a lot of compatibility.
[01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:44.820]  So TGA was pretty compatible with a lot of things.
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:47.460]  That's why we still see a lot of his gear
[01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:50.700]  being used all the time is because it's...
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:51.900]  Not only is it really good,
[01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:56.020]  but it just works with a lot of different
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.740]  complimentary elements.
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:58.580]  It does.
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:01.420]  And we had another question earlier, BC Bud Baron,
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.700]  what TGA gear do you have?
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:07.020]  I actually, I only have a few things with me right now,
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:09.180]  just the things that I've gotten since the last show,
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:12.060]  but in my arsenal of TGA,
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:17.180]  I have a few of the Jack's Cleaner II beans remaining.
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:19.740]  I have a few of the Agent Orange beans remaining,
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:24.740]  and these were both picked up between 2011, 2014
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:26.780]  in the Washington Medical System.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:28.700]  I was a patient in.
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:32.900]  And then Miranda Family Farms, who's out on the East Coast.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:36.660]  He was a distributor for a while of the Dank stuff.
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:41.700]  And he sent me some of his work as well as Dairy Queen.
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:45.140]  So I still have a little Dairy Queen left.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:47.260]  I'm smoking on Dairy Queen right now.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:49.740]  So those were the TGA ones that I've kind of had
[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.060]  over the years.
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:53.420]  And yeah, I've loved them, man.
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:58.420]  The TGA was kind of like my introduction to terpene.
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:02.060]  Something other than like a GOGs and stuff like that.
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:04.260]  So yeah, this is the dairy...
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.300]  Finally, it focuses.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:06.180]  There we go.
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:08.580]  This is the Dairy Queen.
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:12.020]  And like most of the TGA stuff for me, daytime.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:17.180]  This is usually what I'm going to in the morning
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:20.740]  or the afternoon, just to kind of still go,
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:23.860]  but change my outlook a little bit.
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:28.860]  So yeah, those were mine.
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.420]  I don't know, have you guys run any in the past?
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:36.260]  Or maybe you have any of the TGA or the Dank as well?
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:37.100]  Dave?
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:41.740]  I can embarrassingly say, no, I have not.
[01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:45.020]  I'm a TGA fan collector.
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:49.020]  I am not worthy of this conversation anymore.
[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:52.420]  That is like when you put something into Google
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:54.700]  and you get zero results.
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:56.580]  There's an actual term for it.
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.180]  It's called Google whack.
[01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:00.020]  So it's too...
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:02.980]  Wow.
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.740]  I'm not worthy.
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:07.300]  We just Google wax Dave, everybody.
[01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:10.380]  Awesome.
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.100]  Taller, yeah, the Jax Cleaner 2.
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:16.020]  Actually, I've got some of that across that I made with it.
[01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:17.180]  Got that in the jar here.
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:19.900]  Cause this is just super lemon.
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:23.900]  I mean, the cleaner, the Jax Cleaner 2, the lemon on it.
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:27.340]  I've said it probably more times than people need to hear it
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.580]  but the terpenes are so acidic,
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.940]  it eats the rubber seal on the top of your ball jar.
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.420]  Like it's that lemony.
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:35.700]  I love it.
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:36.620]  Sounds nice.
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:38.140]  That sounds real nice.
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.180]  It's a good one.
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:41.580]  Definitely landed it to the Jack the Ripper too.
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:44.580]  That's super lemony.
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:45.700]  That's something that I've grown
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:49.500]  that definitely has that in there, but it's good stuff.
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:51.700]  Nice.
[01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.100]  Well, let's see, back to...
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.340]  Let me pull something out here.
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:00.820]  This is another something that set my mailbox on fire.
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:01.660]  Thanks, Dave.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:06.740]  Some Dutch Blooms work, the Dosey Liquor.
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:07.580]  Oh, nice.
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:10.100]  And I'm kind of stoked on this one.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:11.260]  So what was this again?
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:14.660]  It was Dosey Doze and Dog Liquor?
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:17.700]  No, not Dog Liquor.
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:20.380]  It was Dosey Doze and Licorice Lime.
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:22.860]  Lic, ooh, Licorice Lime.
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.460]  That sounds tasty.
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:27.940]  Yes, it's Lime Vine.
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.700]  And oh my God, I can't remember the rest.
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:30.540]  There's too many.
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:31.620]  There's too many.
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:35.300]  Well, I'm stoked.
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:36.900]  The Dosey Doze is, you know,
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:40.060]  usually that's something that's gonna go a few more weeks,
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:43.140]  nine to 11 from what I understand.
[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:48.140]  But that does kind of bring that like gassy profile to it.
[01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:52.020]  I had from Oregon, it's called Duck Tape,
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:54.820]  but it was a GG4 times the Dosey Doze.
[01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:56.900]  And that's fucking awesome.
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:57.860]  Sure.
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:02.860]  And it wasn't, you know, fully GG4 leaning.
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:05.220]  Like it definitely had influences from something else.
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:07.460]  I can only assume that it was the Dosey Doze.
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:11.380]  So I'm kind of anxious to see what that does in this one.
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.220]  Absolutely.
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.660]  Cause he's been doing some good work.
[01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:17.660]  And, you know, again,
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:19.500]  it's nice when you do see a lot of people
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:20.660]  running these out too.
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:25.860]  It almost is like people are running the preview for you.
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:30.660]  You're like, no, not the bug structure I'm after.
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:34.540]  File in the maybe later category, you know?
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:36.460]  And that's where testers come in handy too
[01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:38.580]  for the breeders, man.
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:39.900]  Absolutely.
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:41.980]  Having pictures of their work
[01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:44.100]  is pretty darn priceless to them.
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.920]  So yeah, if you're doing that for anybody,
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.620]  make sure you send them pictures.
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:52.740]  A shooter.
[01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:54.380]  I made duct tape times BLR.
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:57.500]  What's the BLR in there, shooter?
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:00.420]  But I know you're gonna know about the black line reserve.
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:01.260]  Yeah.
[01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:02.700]  I should have just asked Dave.
[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:05.940]  Screw you, Alexa.
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:06.780]  I'm a little black though.
[01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:07.620]  Right?
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.100]  Let's see, Mok in here.
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:16.300]  Tom McCormick doing some old school,
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:18.860]  definitely doing the old school.
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:21.300]  You were talking or we're seeing,
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:24.380]  I saw the S1 on that brother's grim there.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:26.660]  And then James, we were talking about open pollination,
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:28.300]  just preserve projects earlier.
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:29.120]  That makes me think.
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.540]  So is Humboldt CSI the person
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:34.380]  that is doing a lot of the selfing,
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:37.580]  just kind of the seed increases with the blessing
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:42.260]  of the breeders who have these lines?
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.300]  Is that him or who is it out there
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:48.940]  that is getting all the nice stuff from breeders
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:51.240]  just so they could just run seed increases?
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:54.180]  I know he's definitely doing a lot
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:55.580]  of the work you're describing.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.500]  I don't know if that's specifically what it is,
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.820]  but I know he's definitely doing a lot of feminized seeds,
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:03.500]  a lot of selfing of these big name cuts,
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:08.320]  these high end exclusive rarity, rare clones,
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.300]  and making them available in feminized seed form
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.860]  for people to use.
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.780]  He's definitely someone who has the right connections.
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:17.500]  He's been doing this a long time.
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:20.460]  Inspector, someone you could trust, definitely.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:21.300]  Yeah.
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:22.140]  Nice.
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:22.960]  Yep, Humboldt CSI.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:26.700]  And earlier I was telling the story about the twin peaks
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:29.120]  and how they came my way.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:33.420]  Thank you.
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:34.420]  That's the guy.
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:35.660]  That's the guy.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:36.500]  Thank you.
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:41.020]  Just talking about Todd McCormick,
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:42.660]  there's some authentic genetics.
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:43.940]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:45.780]  Which ones did you pick up from him?
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:48.940]  Cause he's had some of the classics.
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.780]  Let's see what's in this container.
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:52.640]  Got NL number two.
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.260]  Another one.
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:56.800]  Another NL number two.
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:01.140]  So is that, are they five packs, 10 packs?
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:02.580]  10 packs, 10 packs.
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:05.540]  Got a 10 pack of the NL number five.
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.240]  Another of the NL number five.
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:13.220]  And then we've got, looks like an 11 pack of the skunk one.
[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:14.900]  That was from his older packaging.
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:16.260]  Yeah.
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.980]  Another of the original Hayes.
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:19.820]  Oh, nice.
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:21.660]  I think there's like maybe 30 of them
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:23.200]  and 30 skunks in there.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:25.660]  Wow.
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:26.780]  Now has anybody,
[01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:31.740]  like I haven't heard much about like germination rates
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:35.280]  or necessarily grow outs from some of these older seeds
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.220]  that he's been putting out lately.
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.060]  I don't know.
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.060]  Have you guys heard any feedback from that yet?
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.300]  Well, I know it's an increase that he's done.
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:46.140]  He's basically taken these two F2.
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:48.540]  That's what a lot of these are.
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:52.060]  Older seed stock that he had gotten his hands on
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:54.100]  a couple of years ago and popped them
[01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:55.260]  and has increased them
[01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:58.540]  and made his own crosses here and there.
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:01.920]  So I've heard good things about the germination rates.
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:04.680]  I know that he was trying to select
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:06.380]  towards the more accurate skunk,
[01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:09.280]  but skunk one is gonna be a little sweeter to begin with.
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:11.940]  No matter what you do,
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.060]  just that's the way skunk man scam.
[01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:15.060]  Read it for years.
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:17.300]  He selected towards that.
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:19.620]  So it's very difficult.
[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.040]  From what I've heard of people popping it,
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:24.460]  that they do tend to lean more towards that skunk one,
[01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:26.180]  older or that sweeter skunk one,
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:29.340]  as opposed to the accurate that he was more hopeful for,
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:30.900]  but hey, it is what it is.
[01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:32.220]  Yeah, it is what it is.
[01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:33.540]  That's a good way to put it.
[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:34.420]  Yeah.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.260]  Yeah.
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:38.500]  And you never know, it still might be buried in there
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.500]  and you just happen to pull,
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.300]  like we said, that lottery ticket.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:42.140]  Yeah.
[01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:44.900]  So that's why you've got two 10 packs.
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:46.140]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:49.900]  Yeah, I mean, we stacked for that,
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:52.860]  when I was mentioning that I-95 project,
[01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:56.900]  I have stacked about 300 seeds to go through
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:21:00.260]  for that I-95 project to pick winners off of,
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:04.820]  because I was just like, look, it's out here.
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:07.780]  I wanna make something really extraordinary out of this.
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.180]  Let's go for it.
[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:14.860]  And we've done that with a couple of these bigger things
[01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:18.700]  that we have bigger seeds of, the coastal collision,
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:21.140]  we have about a hundred seeds.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:26.060]  Chad, that might come from the-
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:29.860]  The beelief, the Kool-Aid man that I agree with water only,
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:31.780]  he was asking how it came out.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:34.340]  And I'm like, eh, a little frosty.
[01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:35.180]  Yeah.
[01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:36.700]  I believe that looks pretty good.
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.500]  Yeah, I'd say so.
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.020]  Again, this was just a water only.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:43.380]  This was that Sohum Living Soil, but yeah, no,
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.940]  sorry not to distract you there,
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:46.780]  but he asked and I happened to actually
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:48.300]  just have a few pictures in here.
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:49.580]  It's all good.
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:52.860]  Which belief strain were you running there?
[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:54.420]  This is the Kool-Aid man.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:59.420]  So it is a collaboration of him and Lit Farms.
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:04.580]  It was a watermelon mimosa from number 10
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:07.940]  from Lit Farms times beeliefs creature.
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:13.940]  And that is what came out in that fricking is amazing.
[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:18.700]  It's honestly the most trichome covered plant
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.300]  I've grown in my life.
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:23.580]  So do you like running the belief stuff?
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:26.220]  That's the only thing that I've run from him,
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.940]  but yeah, absolutely.
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:31.180]  I only popped a few of the seeds
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:34.900]  and every single one of them was just like a winner.
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:35.740]  So-
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:36.740]  That's awesome.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:39.700]  Yeah, I would definitely try his stuff again.
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.140]  Yeah, I mean, I have a pack of his,
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:45.860]  when he very first did his like original drop
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:49.340]  of everything he included to,
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:50.700]  I don't know if it was to everyone
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:52.060]  who was part of the first drop
[01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:55.060]  or if it was whatever it may have been,
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:59.060]  he included some of the actual S1s of his chimera.
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:22:59.900]  Oh, wow.
[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:04.140]  And in there, and it's one of those things
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.940]  where like if I find somebody who's really keen
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:10.260]  on the belief stuff, like, I mean, from those plants,
[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:13.620]  you look like you did a, you know, one hell of a job.
[01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:16.420]  You know, if you wanna pop some chimera selves
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:18.780]  and see what you can get out of them,
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.300]  I'd love to send them to you.
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:23.980]  Cause I, as I said, it's just the amount
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.700]  of other things I have going on.
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:28.020]  It's just never gonna end.
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:31.460]  So I gotta start shelling them out to people
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:33.660]  so that they can be enjoyed, man.
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.660]  Yeah, that is amazing.
[01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:38.580]  I've already sent you my address.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.740]  How about that shit?
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:40.580]  Perfect.
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:42.660]  I'll send that right away.
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:46.140]  And for, you know, people listening to, you know,
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:48.500]  B. Lee, he's got the, he does the Cs
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:51.180]  but he also has the big clone menu
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:55.620]  and the chimera is regularly sold
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.900]  at a $10,000 price tag.
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:58.740]  Yep.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:23:59.580]  Regularly.
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:00.460]  Yep.
[01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:01.300]  So.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.180]  So you pull a winner out of that and you're.
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:05.860]  I mean.
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:07.300]  You're looking good.
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:08.140]  Yeah.
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:10.940]  I'd love to see what comes out of those.
[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:11.780]  You know what?
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:12.620]  There could be some cool stuff.
[01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:13.460]  You never know.
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:16.100]  I mean, it's, I mean, with S1s,
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:19.900]  it's always kind of a crap shoot a little bit,
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:23.620]  but you know, they, as long as they germinate okay,
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:26.100]  you know, you're gonna get a little bit of variety,
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:31.100]  but the chimera was such a, it's, I mean,
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:35.060]  it's a, just a big, like bushy plant.
[01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:36.900]  Like it's just a big, powerful,
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:40.260]  like just stacked together like the Hulk almost, you know?
[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:44.380]  And so I feel like it would be a good plant
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:47.580]  to run side by side and just see what you come up with.
[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:48.420]  Yeah.
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:49.260]  I would.
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:50.100]  I would do that.
[01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:50.940]  Yeah.
[01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:52.300]  I will do that.
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:57.700]  Just to touch on that, you're running these I-95.
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:00.100]  I can't wait to see what you get with that.
[01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:02.820]  Anything that's touched that I've grown
[01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:04.580]  has been just a winner.
[01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:08.420]  It makes sour diesel grow beautifully, grow like a champ.
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:11.460]  It just adds such a sturdy, wonderful structure.
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:14.260]  It's the reason that Choca-Cola grows so much better
[01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:18.500]  than the slushy beer, which has the same moms,
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:23.060]  but that I-95 being added to it, just, oh, love it.
[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:23.900]  I love it.
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:26.180]  So I can't wait to see what you get with that.
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:28.540]  Chad, do you notice how he's vying for a cut
[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.100]  of whatever the winner is here?
[01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:31.900]  Is that too apparent?
[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:34.220]  Is he subtle enough with that?
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:39.180]  I, you know, you might need to pull my hair a little bit,
[01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:40.020]  but.
[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:42.860]  Listen, I got my knee pads ready, guys.
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:46.980]  Dave's box is always open.
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:48.420]  That is something I know.
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:50.900]  Mailbox, guys, mailbox.
[01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:52.220]  Mailbox, mailbox.
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:56.220]  And I had an awesome transition there
[01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:58.020]  and that just went out the window.
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:04.060]  I don't even know what the, what are we doing here?
[01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:06.540]  And where am I?
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:07.380]  Where am I?
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.700]  Here is another wonderful gift from the man
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:13.780]  sitting on your screen there to the right.
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:15.220]  These were a blessing from him,
[01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:17.780]  an open pollination of Willy's Wonder.
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:18.740]  Oh, wow.
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:19.580]  Yay.
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:20.420]  That's nice.
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:22.980]  Old school, super sativa seed club.
[01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:25.780]  Goodness right there with that Willy's Wonder.
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:26.860]  Yeah.
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:30.300]  That was one of those, man, that I think it was,
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:32.420]  honestly, I think it might've been a charity auction
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.700]  that somebody, it may have been Nick,
[01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:36.620]  it may have been somebody else put together
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:39.220]  like four of those packs, whatever they had.
[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:40.740]  And they were just like, they were just like,
[01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:41.580]  okay, you know what?
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:43.460]  I'm gonna throw these up here.
[01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:44.820]  They went really cheap.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:46.860]  And I was like, I'm not gonna let, you know,
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:49.940]  I'm not gonna turn down a hundred seeds of Willy's Wonder
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:52.300]  and see what happens with them.
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:55.580]  But at the same time, like, I'm probably not gonna run.
[01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:59.180]  That is like what I see as the perfect opportunity
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:01.580]  to be able to give those out to people
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:06.580]  who I know will appreciate them whenever they get to them.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:07.980]  And, you know, down the road,
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:12.060]  I'm sure I will get a message from, you know, Dave,
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.420]  from, I think I've given away
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.700]  maybe another pack or two as well.
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:19.620]  And I know I'll hear back and hear what, you know,
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:21.500]  what all they found and if they found something
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:25.460]  really unique and, you know, they wanna share it back
[01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:27.780]  or whatever else, I mean, that's just,
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:32.500]  it's part of being able to give and share in this community.
[01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.820]  So it's always nice.
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:36.820]  See, he's got his knee pads ready too.
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:41.620]  I knew that was coming back, man.
[01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:43.740]  I knew as soon as I started talking, I'm like,
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:45.860]  oh shit, Dave's gonna get me on this.
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:49.700]  Oh God, I can't wait to see you two
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:50.940]  in the next auction together.
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:51.780]  That'll be fun.
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:56.540]  You actually reminded me though, when you said Nick,
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:27:59.180]  cause you know, that reminds me of, you know,
[01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:01.820]  Dave has been a pretty heavy collector of the root beer,
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:04.220]  also like kind of the Coca-Cola stuff.
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:07.620]  Where have you fallen in on that?
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:09.860]  Is that something that you've been actively collecting
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:10.700]  as well?
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:15.180]  So I have a few packs of the Coca-Cola root beer stuff
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:17.540]  from Nick.
[01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:22.540]  And then I do have, you know, the like original
[01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:26.020]  that they sent out, the root beer that went out
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:30.060]  and you know, was like, all of it was done
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:33.460]  in like 10 seconds or whatever when Skunk Tech
[01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:36.340]  and Mean Genes sent it out together.
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:41.220]  I also though, I have seen right now,
[01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:44.340]  we are actually running Skunk Tech's dome piece,
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:46.340]  which is it's headband.
[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:50.340]  It's a 707 headband crossed to the root beer.
[01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:55.340]  And so we are really curious to see what comes of that.
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:57.020]  Cause I grabbed a couple of packs of that
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:02.020]  cause I was really keen on, I am a massive headband fan
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:06.540]  and especially, you know, that cut came right from Ben
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:10.820]  himself up at Emerald Mountain Legacy, such an amazing guy.
[01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:14.860]  And so I was super keen on seeing what all developed
[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:16.780]  from those.
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:20.300]  And, you know, we're right now it looks,
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:21.940]  they look absolutely beautiful.
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:25.500]  So definitely a root beer fan.
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.940]  Didn't get as much into the Coca-Cola root beer,
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:31.700]  not because I wasn't keen on that as well.
[01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.300]  It's just, there was just so many things to pick from
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.260]  for a while there that I just kinda, you know,
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:38.660]  I was like, I'm gonna grab a few things
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:40.380]  from a few different places.
[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:44.180]  And I was also in a bit of a Bodie buying phase
[01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:45.260]  at that point, I think.
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:48.060]  And I was like, I'm gonna grab every Bodie under the sun.
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:48.900]  So.
[01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:50.980]  Those are lovely, man.
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:53.180]  That's a person who I, you know,
[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:55.180]  love to talk to about genetics.
[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:56.940]  I've never had the chance to meet him or talk to him
[01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:58.420]  or even run his gear for that matter.
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:01.060]  But I've heard interviews that he's done.
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:03.140]  Seems like a really cool guy.
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:07.500]  And again, you know, kind of like the strain
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.260]  we were talking about earlier,
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:12.820]  I've never really heard anything bad about his genetics.
[01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:15.580]  People are always excited about what they can find.
[01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:17.620]  It's, you know, they never quite know exactly
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:21.260]  what to expect sometimes other than good.
[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:22.100]  Yeah.
[01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.180]  And hey, I'm all for that.
[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:25.380]  Yeah.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:28.780]  Yeah, we wanted to do a project with the GoGeoG stuff.
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:32.020]  So I went out and made sure that I like tracked down
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:35.780]  some, you know, some packs of GoGeoG
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:38.660]  and then also found the Heaven Mountain,
[01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:43.020]  which was it's GoGeoG across to the Appalachia.
[01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:46.140]  That, and if anyone gets a chance to try some Appalachia,
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:47.100]  that's the way to go.
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:51.060]  But, oh, that's a really nice pack right there.
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:53.980]  I love that NL5 oil can.
[01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:56.500]  Yeah, that oil can is the Woodman Canyon oil can.
[01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:57.980]  It sure is.
[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:00.260]  Oh boy.
[01:31:00.260 --> 01:31:01.620]  Now we're playing with fire.
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:02.980]  There's more coming.
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:05.380]  Black Lamb's Root.
[01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:06.220]  Nice pack right there.
[01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:07.340]  Black Lamb's Root here.
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:08.900]  Okay, okay.
[01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:13.590]  Kentucky Ice Tea.
[01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:15.590]  Oh, he used a Summer's End for it.
[01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:16.750]  Cool, man.
[01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:21.710]  Now what, I haven't heard of the Summer's End strain.
[01:31:21.710 --> 01:31:23.590]  Do you guys know much about that?
[01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:28.430]  So the Summer's End is, correct me if I'm wrong, Dave,
[01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:31.910]  I think it's Candied Lemons across to his,
[01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:33.590]  is it across to Pam, I think?
[01:31:33.630 --> 01:31:34.470]  You got it.
[01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:36.350]  That is exactly what it is.
[01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:39.190]  Nice, and Pam comes from Mr. Trees, right?
[01:31:39.190 --> 01:31:40.670]  Yes, it does.
[01:31:40.670 --> 01:31:41.510]  Okay.
[01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:44.270]  Same with his work, The Work.
[01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:47.830]  That's the BLR Testarossa and Pam.
[01:31:49.190 --> 01:31:51.790]  That has made some really gorgeous plants
[01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:54.230]  he's put out there, The Work.
[01:31:54.230 --> 01:31:56.110]  Yeah, I have a pack of his,
[01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:59.070]  I have a double pack of his BLR Testarossa,
[01:31:59.070 --> 01:32:02.670]  just that from his collection
[01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:06.030]  that I would love the chance to run at some point
[01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:09.350]  just because it's, I have heard nothing but good things.
[01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:10.870]  What is, oh man.
[01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:12.070]  B2.
[01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:14.670]  Oh, and it's a Work 23, wow.
[01:32:14.670 --> 01:32:15.510]  Very cool.
[01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:16.350]  Yes.
[01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:18.670]  All right, you got Max Green Coldwell.
[01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:20.590]  Max 21.
[01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:25.350]  Max 21 was from the original release of Cap's Mac.
[01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:28.630]  I know he and Cap are pretty tight.
[01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:29.830]  I know they like each other,
[01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:32.790]  so I wouldn't be surprised to see some more work
[01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:35.510]  between the two of them at some point.
[01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:37.390]  Very true, very true.
[01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:39.390]  I'm trying to find my pack of dome piece.
[01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:40.630]  I got it here somewhere.
[01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:42.670]  But you're talking about it in a good way.
[01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:47.670]  Yeah, we got some dome piece in here.
[01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:55.990]  This was another one that I went and got a few of,
[01:32:55.990 --> 01:33:00.550]  was the Giesel Headband Crown Ripper.
[01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:02.190]  Skulltag, nice.
[01:33:02.190 --> 01:33:04.710]  Because I'm a huge Giesel fan.
[01:33:05.710 --> 01:33:08.350]  And then, let's see.
[01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:09.910]  Got a few more packs of that.
[01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:12.870]  And then you got, oh, the Vader Gator
[01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:17.470]  was his Death Star Headband that he did.
[01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:18.590]  And then.
[01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:19.630]  I like that name.
[01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:21.950]  I didn't grab that one, man, I'm jealous.
[01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:23.910]  And then, let's see.
[01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:26.950]  Oh, and then I got some of his Nughead stuff,
[01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:29.110]  which is the Sour Diesel Headband.
[01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:33.070]  And then here's his dome piece right here,
[01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:36.390]  which is the GMO Root Beer Headband.
[01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:42.390]  And then this was one that came from Gene and Skunk Tech,
[01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:46.310]  which was the Hollywood Pure Kush Headband.
[01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:47.830]  Of course Gene's involved with that.
[01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:48.670]  Look at the picture.
[01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:50.310]  I know, it's too good, man.
[01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:51.950]  And then these were actually,
[01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:54.190]  so then he sent me,
[01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:58.270]  I have been fortunate enough to get to know Skunk
[01:33:58.270 --> 01:34:01.790]  fairly well, and he's been very generous and kind to me
[01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:03.910]  over the last year or so.
[01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:08.230]  And he sent me a Blue Mountain Gas Cross to Headband,
[01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:11.630]  a Daywrecker Cross to Headband,
[01:34:11.630 --> 01:34:14.230]  which Daywrecker is essentially original diesel.
[01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:18.590]  And then this one I'm really excited about
[01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:21.070]  is the Pure Kush Cross to Headband.
[01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:26.990]  So some cool work to run through from Skunk himself.
[01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:33.750]  Also have a bunch of his diesel cartel stuff,
[01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:35.630]  which is like the original diesel
[01:34:35.630 --> 01:34:37.510]  across to the Cuban Black Haze.
[01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:43.870]  So yeah, just kind of went to town on the Skunk Tech.
[01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:47.630]  Yeah, it's not a bad decision at all.
[01:34:47.630 --> 01:34:48.630]  No.
[01:34:48.630 --> 01:34:50.070]  Not a bad decision.
[01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:54.430]  Curious though, I see that you keep them in Ziplocs,
[01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:56.030]  which are good for keeping air out.
[01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:58.950]  Do you also use any kind of desiccants
[01:34:58.950 --> 01:35:01.790]  or how do you store the seeds?
[01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:05.310]  I do use desiccants in everything.
[01:35:06.190 --> 01:35:10.910]  Typically multiple packs in each bag.
[01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:15.430]  I actually go ahead and in the bigger boxes that I have,
[01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:17.190]  I even keep like a hygrometer.
[01:35:17.190 --> 01:35:18.470]  Yep, exactly.
[01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:23.470]  Because before I even really got into weed,
[01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:25.190]  I was a cigar smoker.
[01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:28.150]  So I knew all about the whole humidification thing.
[01:35:28.150 --> 01:35:29.310]  And so I was like, okay,
[01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:32.670]  I'm gonna make sure I keep this stuff really, really clean.
[01:35:32.670 --> 01:35:36.510]  And then I have a refrigerator down the basement
[01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:40.350]  that is solely my vault refrigerator of just,
[01:35:40.350 --> 01:35:43.910]  of all just seeds, nothing else.
[01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:48.430]  And they've been kept well.
[01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:51.950]  Do they go in and out of the fridge?
[01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:54.750]  Well, on only like these occasions
[01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:57.550]  will I be taking them out too often.
[01:35:57.550 --> 01:36:00.550]  I really like to keep them in a consistent environment.
[01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:03.670]  I don't usually like to throw them around too much,
[01:36:03.670 --> 01:36:05.630]  but for something like this where it's,
[01:36:05.630 --> 01:36:08.790]  hey, it's a few hours or whatever,
[01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:11.030]  I'm not too worried about it.
[01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:13.670]  But yeah, I definitely don't just leave them out
[01:36:13.670 --> 01:36:15.030]  just because I don't wanna,
[01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:18.590]  that would be like the downfall right there
[01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:20.630]  is all of a sudden nothing's working
[01:36:20.630 --> 01:36:21.750]  and you're like, wait a second,
[01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:23.910]  did I kill the seed collection off?
[01:36:25.670 --> 01:36:29.790]  Well, there is a little bit of a learning curve to it.
[01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:30.630]  Definitely.
[01:36:31.710 --> 01:36:36.710]  The 2010, 2011 era when I picked up those TGA seeds,
[01:36:38.910 --> 01:36:42.230]  that's kind of, I was working different things at that time
[01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:43.950]  and I did a lot of like seed increases,
[01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:46.830]  not having the same knowledge I have today.
[01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:48.910]  And I still have a lot of those seeds,
[01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:50.710]  but the germination rate is something
[01:36:50.710 --> 01:36:53.790]  where it's just like, ridiculous.
[01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:55.990]  Like I have enough that if you want a couple,
[01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:59.270]  like F it, just throw 50 in a paper towel
[01:36:59.270 --> 01:37:01.670]  and see if you can't tend to pop.
[01:37:03.630 --> 01:37:06.830]  But that's fine, that's fun, that's older stuff.
[01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:09.750]  But storage is one of those questions
[01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:11.590]  you can really only answer with time,
[01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:14.230]  which is kind of the bitch about it.
[01:37:14.230 --> 01:37:15.070]  Yeah, oh, it is.
[01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:17.110]  It's absolutely, you're absolutely right.
[01:37:17.110 --> 01:37:20.470]  There's nothing you can go off of otherwise
[01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:22.510]  except for testing them as you go.
[01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:26.150]  And sometimes that's not a bad thing to do.
[01:37:26.150 --> 01:37:28.550]  Like just have an extra pack of something,
[01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:30.990]  throw them down if you can get them in the tent or whatever
[01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:33.030]  and just see what comes up
[01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:35.190]  and just make sure that you're not all of a sudden
[01:37:35.190 --> 01:37:38.030]  like getting a bunch of dud packs of things.
[01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:42.790]  And we had that happen with something not too long ago
[01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:45.350]  where we were freaking out thinking, oh my gosh,
[01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:49.630]  did we, is our storage system not working or whatever else?
[01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:52.950]  And it just unfortunately turned out that several packs
[01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:57.510]  of I think it was like the GG4S ones
[01:37:57.510 --> 01:38:00.990]  from GG strains or something like that.
[01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:03.470]  It was something where we were just like,
[01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:06.230]  huh, this is really strange that all of them.
[01:38:06.230 --> 01:38:09.750]  And it was across the board, like zero out of 10 popped.
[01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:11.150]  They were all just duds.
[01:38:11.150 --> 01:38:13.590]  And so we were a little nervous at first.
[01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:15.710]  We were like, okay, is this our fault?
[01:38:15.710 --> 01:38:17.950]  Did we just ruin all this?
[01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:19.830]  But no, it actually, it worked out okay.
[01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:23.150]  We popped a few other packs from the exact same box
[01:38:23.150 --> 01:38:24.390]  and those turned out perfect.
[01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:27.510]  So it happens sometimes
[01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:29.630]  and that's kind of the risk you take, right?
[01:38:29.630 --> 01:38:32.710]  I mean, sometimes the packs aren't gonna be great
[01:38:32.710 --> 01:38:34.950]  and depending on who you're working with,
[01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:36.990]  some of them will maybe give you a pass.
[01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:39.430]  It'll be like, yeah, man, here, I'll send you another pack.
[01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:41.590]  Other people, they don't give a damn.
[01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:42.430]  Let's be honest.
[01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:44.110]  They're just like, hey, you paid for it.
[01:38:44.110 --> 01:38:44.950]  You bought it.
[01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:46.110]  That's on you.
[01:38:46.110 --> 01:38:47.710]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:47.710 --> 01:38:49.910]  From what I've heard, it's been a toss up
[01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:52.790]  as far as like levels of customer service.
[01:38:53.670 --> 01:38:55.750]  It doesn't seem to be a middle ground.
[01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:58.150]  It's like either you get a, well, you suck rookie
[01:38:58.150 --> 01:38:59.950]  or like, hey dude, here's another pack.
[01:38:59.950 --> 01:39:01.350]  Yep, yep, yep.
[01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:02.470]  That's a good way to put it.
[01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:04.990]  That's a really good way to put it.
[01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:06.230]  Oh, snaps.
[01:39:08.190 --> 01:39:09.670]  Damn, Dave.
[01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:11.790]  I feel inferior.
[01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:14.470]  This guy's beating me with the skunk tech collection, man.
[01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:16.910]  That is not at all true.
[01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:18.390]  That is not at all true.
[01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:21.030]  Let's hear you squirm for a little bit, Dave.
[01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:22.790]  Please, this is something we've not seen
[01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:24.790]  in seven episodes.
[01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:29.790]  Oh, shit, man.
[01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:33.390]  Look at all these fancy, fresh from skunk tech crosses.
[01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:34.470]  Like, damn, man.
[01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:37.350]  That's the Blue Mountain Gas headband.
[01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:38.750]  That should be amazing, by the way.
[01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:40.950]  I know you're excited about the Pure Kush headband.
[01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:42.470]  I'm telling you, that Blue Mountain Gas,
[01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:46.870]  that's the Sauer DI95 I was basically orgasming over before.
[01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:49.150]  Oh my God, that's a bucket winner.
[01:39:49.150 --> 01:39:51.790]  Yeah, well, I mean, and see, that's what's so cool
[01:39:51.790 --> 01:39:53.870]  is like when I hear somebody get so excited
[01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:55.470]  about something that maybe I have,
[01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:57.670]  and if it is something that I wanna run,
[01:39:57.670 --> 01:39:59.750]  then I'm gonna make sure they get a cut of it.
[01:39:59.750 --> 01:40:03.110]  Like, I'm not gonna hold it back and be like,
[01:40:03.110 --> 01:40:06.550]  nope, this is mine, and no one else gets any,
[01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:07.390]  and blah, blah, blah.
[01:40:07.390 --> 01:40:10.790]  No, I mean, because I know Dave is, yeah, exactly.
[01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:12.550]  Because I know Dave is gonna enjoy it,
[01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:16.750]  and he's gonna be able to do some work with it.
[01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:20.870]  And so I would never keep that to myself
[01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:22.390]  if we grew it out and we were like,
[01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:25.470]  wow, this is some, we really got a couple winners here.
[01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:28.910]  I'd much rather be able to throw it to a couple people
[01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:30.430]  and be like, hey, see what you,
[01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:34.190]  see how this works for you, and let's see what happens.
[01:40:34.190 --> 01:40:37.590]  Because it's, as I said, it's just all about love.
[01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:40.230]  It's all about being able to share, man.
[01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:42.510]  I like hearing that, cannabis is to be shared.
[01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:44.270]  Cannabis is to be enjoyed.
[01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:46.510]  100%, man, yeah.
[01:40:46.510 --> 01:40:47.350]  That's awesome.
[01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:49.070]  We had another question here
[01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:50.590]  that you might be able to answer,
[01:40:50.590 --> 01:40:52.190]  and it struck me because he says,
[01:40:52.190 --> 01:40:55.510]  thug pug, the only respectable Michigan breeder?
[01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:58.710]  So he's looking for more, but my brain automatically,
[01:40:58.710 --> 01:41:01.510]  when I think of Michigan and breeders,
[01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:03.710]  thug pug is where it goes to,
[01:41:03.710 --> 01:41:07.870]  mainly because of the GMO or a lot of the breaths,
[01:41:07.870 --> 01:41:10.310]  actually, is what I'm thinking here.
[01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:13.950]  But they were popular for you guys for many years,
[01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:16.630]  many years, and then it hit the West Coast,
[01:41:16.630 --> 01:41:18.590]  and we were all about it.
[01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:20.190]  I looked into it, and I'm like,
[01:41:20.190 --> 01:41:22.070]  this thing's eight years old over there?
[01:41:22.830 --> 01:41:24.430]  So I don't know.
[01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:27.510]  Do you know of any people that you enjoy
[01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:29.070]  that are in the Michigan area?
[01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:29.910]  I mean, yeah.
[01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:30.750]  I mean, first of all,
[01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:33.750]  we've been talking a lot about Lime Rising Farms there.
[01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:37.630]  That is, Nick does some excellent work.
[01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:41.790]  He does it when he's able to,
[01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:46.110]  so sometimes it's not super available
[01:41:46.110 --> 01:41:50.210]  when he's able to put some things out there.
[01:41:51.210 --> 01:41:53.050]  Michigan grower-wise, I mean,
[01:41:53.050 --> 01:41:55.690]  you have Fresh Coast out there.
[01:41:55.690 --> 01:41:57.730]  You have Third Coast genetics.
[01:41:59.290 --> 01:42:01.530]  The guys at Gage Green finally split
[01:42:01.530 --> 01:42:03.070]  and went their own ways.
[01:42:04.250 --> 01:42:07.610]  And they're, to be honest, it's...
[01:42:08.930 --> 01:42:09.770]  Messy.
[01:42:10.890 --> 01:42:13.290]  Unfortunately, the Michigan environment
[01:42:13.290 --> 01:42:15.490]  got pretty toxic and weird for a while
[01:42:15.490 --> 01:42:18.610]  with people stealing cuts from other people
[01:42:18.610 --> 01:42:19.450]  and stuff like that,
[01:42:19.450 --> 01:42:22.050]  not giving any sort of respect to one another.
[01:42:22.050 --> 01:42:26.250]  And honestly, the guy who really helped to create
[01:42:26.250 --> 01:42:31.250]  a lot of what is staples in the state of Michigan
[01:42:31.730 --> 01:42:35.770]  is Hayes Manseeds, and he's been around forever
[01:42:35.770 --> 01:42:40.130]  in the thumb of Michigan.
[01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:42.330]  And yep, exactly, exactly.
[01:42:42.330 --> 01:42:43.170]  You know what?
[01:42:43.170 --> 01:42:46.650]  I think he's right up kind of here, actually.
[01:42:46.690 --> 01:42:48.650]  I used to live in Holland over here.
[01:42:48.650 --> 01:42:50.370]  Oh, beautiful place.
[01:42:50.370 --> 01:42:53.750]  Love, love going on weekends to Holland, for sure.
[01:42:55.250 --> 01:42:57.930]  And so he was the one that really came up
[01:42:57.930 --> 01:43:00.610]  with a lot of what we're seeing today
[01:43:00.610 --> 01:43:04.170]  as stuff that Gage Green threw out there.
[01:43:05.290 --> 01:43:07.450]  I mean, remember, just to give you a background,
[01:43:07.450 --> 01:43:09.890]  ThugPug was a tester for Gage Green.
[01:43:10.930 --> 01:43:14.570]  And so a lot of what he actually took
[01:43:14.570 --> 01:43:17.850]  was stuff that came from Gage Green,
[01:43:17.850 --> 01:43:21.410]  but then Gage Green had already taken it from Hayes Man.
[01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:24.330]  And no one had gotten the proper credit
[01:43:24.330 --> 01:43:26.570]  that they really deserved out of it.
[01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:28.970]  I don't wanna, I am not here to bash
[01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:31.850]  or to question other people's motives with their things.
[01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:35.930]  It's their own story and whatever else.
[01:43:35.930 --> 01:43:37.970]  I just know that it was kind of an odd,
[01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:40.770]  it was an unfortunate situation with some of that stuff.
[01:43:40.770 --> 01:43:42.330]  And it was kind of one of those things
[01:43:42.330 --> 01:43:44.890]  where people were racing to the top of the ladder.
[01:43:45.810 --> 01:43:49.810]  And some of it worked out really well.
[01:43:49.810 --> 01:43:54.050]  A lot of people went on a huge ThugPug craze for a while.
[01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:57.970]  And then now it's really died down
[01:43:57.970 --> 01:44:00.970]  and it's like bare minimum anymore.
[01:44:00.970 --> 01:44:02.770]  Like now people are just can't get rid
[01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:04.090]  of their packs fast enough.
[01:44:04.090 --> 01:44:08.330]  So it was kind of because he decided,
[01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:11.210]  he told everyone I'm gonna retire and I'm gonna be done.
[01:44:11.210 --> 01:44:12.530]  That's what I understood.
[01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:13.970]  And then all of a sudden he decided,
[01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:16.370]  no, I'm now gonna come out with all this stuff
[01:44:16.370 --> 01:44:19.250]  and wanted to make a big bank out of it
[01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:23.530]  with his unicorn poop, a new unicorn poop strain.
[01:44:24.450 --> 01:44:29.130]  And it was just a very odd move that unfortunately
[01:44:29.130 --> 01:44:30.930]  I think threw a lot of people off
[01:44:30.930 --> 01:44:32.730]  and made them go a different direction
[01:44:32.730 --> 01:44:37.530]  because they just felt like it was kind of not the nicest
[01:44:37.530 --> 01:44:39.890]  and some unfortunate business tactics there.
[01:44:40.810 --> 01:44:43.730]  It's the old sriracha move.
[01:44:43.730 --> 01:44:46.210]  Telling everybody they're discontinuing sriracha
[01:44:46.210 --> 01:44:48.810]  so everybody runs out and grabs it by the case.
[01:44:48.810 --> 01:44:51.410]  And months later it's back.
[01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:52.370]  It's right there.
[01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:53.210]  It's right there.
[01:44:53.210 --> 01:44:54.890]  I've got four cases of sriracha sauce.
[01:44:54.890 --> 01:44:57.610]  What the fuck am I gonna do with that, man?
[01:44:57.610 --> 01:44:58.730]  They did it with Twinkies.
[01:44:58.730 --> 01:45:00.810]  They're doing it with Choco Taco right now.
[01:45:00.810 --> 01:45:01.650]  Yep, yep.
[01:45:01.650 --> 01:45:03.690]  Toys R Us is coming back.
[01:45:03.690 --> 01:45:04.530]  Are they really?
[01:45:04.530 --> 01:45:06.770]  Yeah, I think they opened up nice stores.
[01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:09.850]  I think it's like inside of, we're so off topic
[01:45:10.810 --> 01:45:14.290]  but yeah, Toys R Us is coming back, recognized.
[01:45:14.290 --> 01:45:15.610]  Now.
[01:45:15.610 --> 01:45:16.970]  You mentioned Fresh Coast.
[01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:19.490]  I recently put up a blind bid at an auction.
[01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:21.570]  I didn't even realize what was up there.
[01:45:21.570 --> 01:45:23.410]  A bunch of Fresh Coast bags came with it.
[01:45:23.410 --> 01:45:24.410]  Oh, nice.
[01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:27.330]  So Michigan, obviously I recognize that.
[01:45:27.330 --> 01:45:28.330]  They're from Michigan as well.
[01:45:28.330 --> 01:45:31.490]  What did you pick up there?
[01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:33.090]  Wow, you got quite a few.
[01:45:33.090 --> 01:45:35.010]  We got Swagoo.
[01:45:35.010 --> 01:45:36.930]  We got Truffle Shuffle.
[01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:38.450]  Yay, that's a Goonies thing.
[01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:40.810]  You gotta be from Oregon to call it Truffle Shuffle.
[01:45:40.810 --> 01:45:43.610]  I'm sorry, but I'm calling you out, Fresh Coast.
[01:45:45.130 --> 01:45:46.970]  Garlic Grove.
[01:45:46.970 --> 01:45:51.970]  So when we're talking about Belief for a second there,
[01:45:53.130 --> 01:45:56.250]  Belief's main thing came from that white truffle cut
[01:45:56.250 --> 01:45:57.090]  that he did.
[01:45:57.090 --> 01:45:58.810]  The white truffle actually came
[01:45:58.810 --> 01:46:00.770]  from Fresh Coast Gorilla Butter.
[01:46:01.810 --> 01:46:02.650]  Okay.
[01:46:02.650 --> 01:46:03.930]  So it actually does go back to,
[01:46:03.930 --> 01:46:05.450]  I had an original pack of it
[01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:07.450]  that a friend of mine really, really wanted.
[01:46:07.450 --> 01:46:12.330]  So I gave it to him to be able to run and enjoy.
[01:46:12.330 --> 01:46:17.130]  But he has put his stamp on things.
[01:46:17.130 --> 01:46:20.970]  And I mean, Dave, you got some good stuff right there, man.
[01:46:23.090 --> 01:46:25.650]  I love watching you two make each other squirm.
[01:46:25.650 --> 01:46:26.490]  This is great.
[01:46:26.490 --> 01:46:31.490]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, what's that?
[01:46:31.690 --> 01:46:32.530]  What's that?
[01:46:32.530 --> 01:46:33.970]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:46:33.970 --> 01:46:34.810]  It's like I'm pulling it,
[01:46:34.810 --> 01:46:36.170]  and mine's just an inch further.
[01:46:36.210 --> 01:46:38.010]  You got an extra inch on this one.
[01:46:38.010 --> 01:46:41.490]  He's stepping on it.
[01:46:41.490 --> 01:46:42.330]  Doesn't count.
[01:46:45.330 --> 01:46:48.050]  I'm so embarrassed of my lack of a Skunk Tech collection
[01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:49.290]  compared to his, you know?
[01:46:50.490 --> 01:46:52.810]  This coming from the guy that gets all the right cuts
[01:46:52.810 --> 01:46:54.970]  from Skunk Tech, but doesn't have the seeds.
[01:46:54.970 --> 01:46:57.770]  He's just brokenhearted about it though.
[01:46:57.770 --> 01:47:00.930]  He skips all the, he skips the line.
[01:47:00.930 --> 01:47:02.530]  Well, he does, he skips the line.
[01:47:02.530 --> 01:47:05.090]  So it's like, well, now, now, Dave,
[01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:06.970]  let's come clean here, come on.
[01:47:08.890 --> 01:47:09.730]  You're not wrong.
[01:47:09.730 --> 01:47:13.810]  I'm sitting next to some Texas Shoreline headband
[01:47:13.810 --> 01:47:16.490]  and some Skunk Tech sour diesel.
[01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:19.050]  Damn, so I saw that mentioned earlier in chat,
[01:47:19.050 --> 01:47:20.290]  and I was gonna bring that up,
[01:47:20.290 --> 01:47:22.370]  but they were talking about the Texas Shoreline.
[01:47:22.370 --> 01:47:25.370]  That's something that I've heard people searching for,
[01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:27.330]  hunting for again.
[01:47:27.330 --> 01:47:28.450]  What was it about that?
[01:47:28.450 --> 01:47:29.570]  Like, what is the profile?
[01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:30.650]  Is it strength?
[01:47:30.650 --> 01:47:32.650]  Is it terpenes?
[01:47:33.650 --> 01:47:36.170]  I don't know much about the Texas Shoreline.
[01:47:38.010 --> 01:47:39.410]  I'll let you go.
[01:47:39.410 --> 01:47:41.370]  I mean, Texas Shoreline was just,
[01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:43.890]  was one of the, you know,
[01:47:43.890 --> 01:47:46.970]  it was kind of a regional thing
[01:47:46.970 --> 01:47:50.690]  that they really thought mimicked a lot of what we saw
[01:47:50.690 --> 01:47:52.530]  with Roadkill Skunk.
[01:47:52.530 --> 01:47:54.610]  And so people ran with that.
[01:47:54.610 --> 01:47:58.570]  And I don't know, there's been a lot of people who,
[01:47:58.570 --> 01:48:01.530]  and Dave could probably add much more detail to this,
[01:48:01.530 --> 01:48:03.650]  but there's been a lot of people who aren't sure
[01:48:03.650 --> 01:48:04.890]  if they're getting the real thing,
[01:48:04.890 --> 01:48:07.570]  if it's an iffy thing.
[01:48:07.570 --> 01:48:10.050]  You know, Skunk Tech has always been, you know,
[01:48:10.050 --> 01:48:12.650]  very verifiable with everything that he does.
[01:48:12.650 --> 01:48:14.490]  I mean, he kind of prides himself on that.
[01:48:14.490 --> 01:48:16.210]  So anything that he says,
[01:48:16.210 --> 01:48:19.290]  I would obviously put faith in it.
[01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:21.490]  I know though that it's been like, you know,
[01:48:21.490 --> 01:48:22.570]  just kind of one of those things
[01:48:22.570 --> 01:48:23.930]  where it's just not quite sure,
[01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:27.650]  because it's an older, it's a pretty old strain there.
[01:48:27.650 --> 01:48:29.890]  So I'm not sure exactly what the,
[01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:34.970]  you know, what people think about it outside of maybe like
[01:48:34.970 --> 01:48:36.770]  the one that Skunk Tech has,
[01:48:36.770 --> 01:48:38.970]  but Dave, maybe you can say more on it.
[01:48:39.850 --> 01:48:40.970]  You pretty much nailed it.
[01:48:40.970 --> 01:48:43.450]  I mean, it is something that is elusive.
[01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:46.410]  Not a lot of people would have the real cut
[01:48:46.410 --> 01:48:49.370]  because it was such a tightly held cut in Texas
[01:48:49.370 --> 01:48:52.250]  and that whole region in general.
[01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:56.690]  So like you said, it definitely was said to be
[01:48:56.690 --> 01:48:59.050]  a very skunk oriented pheno,
[01:48:59.050 --> 01:49:04.050]  a very skunk smelling reminder of that old school flavor.
[01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:07.090]  And like you said,
[01:49:07.090 --> 01:49:09.490]  you hope that Skunk Tech has the real stuff
[01:49:09.490 --> 01:49:12.370]  and anything, anytime I've dealt with, you know,
[01:49:12.370 --> 01:49:15.050]  I do trust, I'll stop myself.
[01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:18.570]  I do trust what he says and what he has.
[01:49:18.570 --> 01:49:19.970]  So we'll see, we'll see.
[01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:21.650]  I've never run it myself.
[01:49:21.650 --> 01:49:22.650]  I've only heard about it.
[01:49:22.650 --> 01:49:26.410]  So I was just kind of, hey, I'll try that.
[01:49:26.410 --> 01:49:28.370]  You say it's real, I'll try it.
[01:49:28.690 --> 01:49:31.570]  You know, again, that is kind of another benefit.
[01:49:31.570 --> 01:49:33.530]  Like we started the show out with, you know,
[01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:38.090]  the Mean Gene and the Runts cross that I have.
[01:49:38.090 --> 01:49:41.010]  It's like, you know, I known he grew it out
[01:49:41.010 --> 01:49:44.090]  and he's gonna be a pretty good character judge
[01:49:44.090 --> 01:49:44.930]  of the strain.
[01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:48.130]  And I'm assuming, you know, Skunk Tech, you know,
[01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:52.130]  has grown this out and is like, yeah, okay.
[01:49:52.130 --> 01:49:56.690]  You know, it's very likely, if not, absolutely the one.
[01:49:56.690 --> 01:50:01.130]  So that does go a long way with people.
[01:50:01.130 --> 01:50:04.530]  But that would be nice to see another skunk,
[01:50:04.530 --> 01:50:08.170]  smelly skunk leaning strain, seeing the light of day.
[01:50:08.170 --> 01:50:10.250]  Texas sounds just like a crazy place
[01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:11.810]  to have been growing anyways.
[01:50:11.810 --> 01:50:14.370]  So I don't doubt things were pretty secretive
[01:50:14.370 --> 01:50:16.090]  and held tightly down there, man.
[01:50:16.090 --> 01:50:17.730]  Texas don't play.
[01:50:17.730 --> 01:50:18.570]  No.
[01:50:20.050 --> 01:50:23.930]  So we got about 10 minutes left here.
[01:50:23.970 --> 01:50:26.450]  I like to try to keep it at two hours.
[01:50:26.450 --> 01:50:28.130]  You know, actually both of you guys
[01:50:28.130 --> 01:50:31.530]  are on a much later time zone than I am.
[01:50:31.530 --> 01:50:35.490]  So I wanna be respected of your time.
[01:50:35.490 --> 01:50:37.330]  Could talk about this stuff all day.
[01:50:38.970 --> 01:50:40.530]  I know, it's easy.
[01:50:40.530 --> 01:50:42.610]  Is it, it's kind of amazing where you do.
[01:50:42.610 --> 01:50:43.930]  You like look up and you're like,
[01:50:43.930 --> 01:50:45.770]  it's been an hour and 50 minutes already.
[01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:47.250]  Holy Nike's.
[01:50:47.250 --> 01:50:50.810]  I still, I had five things to show and I've got three left.
[01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:52.130]  So what is that?
[01:50:52.130 --> 01:50:56.330]  That means you guys have been doing a great job tonight.
[01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:57.610]  Thank you.
[01:50:57.610 --> 01:50:59.610]  Well, why don't you show us something you got, man?
[01:50:59.610 --> 01:51:01.810]  Yeah, well, this one's an unreleased one.
[01:51:01.810 --> 01:51:04.170]  This one's something I'm interested in.
[01:51:04.170 --> 01:51:06.370]  Boneyard Seeds, Mr. Toad.
[01:51:06.370 --> 01:51:08.770]  His chem D, he is another person that found out
[01:51:08.770 --> 01:51:11.050]  that I love the chems and he sent me a chem D,
[01:51:11.050 --> 01:51:13.730]  a chem four, chem 91 crosses.
[01:51:13.730 --> 01:51:15.650]  But particularly stoked about this one
[01:51:15.650 --> 01:51:17.490]  cause it's crossed with his mud bone.
[01:51:18.450 --> 01:51:20.690]  Mud bone, and I'll have to look it up here.
[01:51:20.690 --> 01:51:23.570]  It is on the seedfinder.eu site.
[01:51:23.570 --> 01:51:25.690]  If anybody wants the lineage on that one.
[01:51:25.690 --> 01:51:29.650]  But this one he has said is particularly medicinal
[01:51:29.650 --> 01:51:32.530]  and he had worked with a collective
[01:51:32.530 --> 01:51:35.850]  and thousands of patients in the past.
[01:51:35.850 --> 01:51:39.290]  And he was really kind of exploring strains.
[01:51:39.290 --> 01:51:40.970]  And this was one of the strains
[01:51:40.970 --> 01:51:44.290]  that a lot of people had like benefits from.
[01:51:44.290 --> 01:51:47.010]  So to have that crossed into a chem,
[01:51:47.530 --> 01:51:48.370]  I'm kind of stoked for that.
[01:51:48.370 --> 01:51:52.250]  So this was on the front of the list as well
[01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:53.170]  as far as getting popped.
[01:51:53.170 --> 01:51:56.410]  And this was an unreleased one for now.
[01:51:56.410 --> 01:51:58.010]  It might be getting released,
[01:51:58.010 --> 01:52:00.450]  but I found out that even Cheddar Bob doesn't have it.
[01:52:00.450 --> 01:52:02.250]  So, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:52:02.250 --> 01:52:04.090]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:52:04.090 --> 01:52:05.410]  Oh, man.
[01:52:05.410 --> 01:52:07.090]  Cause Cheddar Bob gets everything.
[01:52:07.090 --> 01:52:09.330]  That he does, that he does.
[01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:15.090]  Another one that I got in that group was this.
[01:52:15.090 --> 01:52:16.330]  I'm pretty stoked about this one.
[01:52:16.650 --> 01:52:19.370]  It's a one hitter quitter, which is gonna be strong.
[01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:21.450]  It's the star dog.
[01:52:21.450 --> 01:52:23.210]  Cory, so the Cory Hamecut.
[01:52:23.210 --> 01:52:25.490]  I'm assuming this is from Top Dog Seeds.
[01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:27.890]  It is the original, man.
[01:52:27.890 --> 01:52:30.930]  Yep, times Mr. Toad's Space Cheese,
[01:52:30.930 --> 01:52:34.850]  which I recently ran his Space Cheese times the RKS,
[01:52:34.850 --> 01:52:39.410]  which I believe was the RKS that he got from Todd McCormick.
[01:52:39.410 --> 01:52:40.970]  So I just ran that cross.
[01:52:40.970 --> 01:52:42.490]  And then the other one,
[01:52:42.490 --> 01:52:45.490]  the last one that I had here was the backpack,
[01:52:45.530 --> 01:52:49.370]  the Black Wap Fruit times Space Cheese.
[01:52:49.370 --> 01:52:52.810]  And was the Black Wap Fruit, was that Dutch Blooms?
[01:52:52.810 --> 01:52:53.650]  Come on, Cheddar.
[01:52:53.650 --> 01:52:54.570]  Yes, it is.
[01:52:54.570 --> 01:52:56.450]  Okay, so.
[01:52:56.450 --> 01:52:57.290]  Nice.
[01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:58.250]  Okay, I give up.
[01:52:58.250 --> 01:53:01.650]  But those were what I've received
[01:53:01.650 --> 01:53:04.690]  since the last seed collectors episode.
[01:53:04.690 --> 01:53:07.730]  And they're cutting the line again.
[01:53:07.730 --> 01:53:12.090]  So, yep, that's what I got for you guys.
[01:53:12.090 --> 01:53:13.890]  Those are some solid seeds right there.
[01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:16.010]  He is a really good guy.
[01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:19.130]  And I know he's done a lot with the medical community,
[01:53:19.130 --> 01:53:22.450]  which is obviously very near and dear to my heart.
[01:53:22.450 --> 01:53:25.570]  So I love seeing his stuff out there.
[01:53:25.570 --> 01:53:27.850]  I was at the Regen Conference
[01:53:27.850 --> 01:53:32.010]  that Josh Dutch Blooms put on.
[01:53:32.010 --> 01:53:35.130]  And Nick obviously helped with here in Michigan.
[01:53:35.130 --> 01:53:39.010]  And they had some of his stuff over there as well.
[01:53:39.010 --> 01:53:43.090]  And I made sure he had some Death Star crosses over there.
[01:53:43.090 --> 01:53:48.090]  That was one of the original Death Star cuts
[01:53:48.090 --> 01:53:49.770]  that I was really curious about.
[01:53:49.770 --> 01:53:52.050]  And I saw it with the cheese and I was like,
[01:53:52.050 --> 01:53:54.970]  oh, that's gonna be something real mean right there.
[01:53:54.970 --> 01:53:56.250]  If you put those two together,
[01:53:56.250 --> 01:53:58.170]  that's gonna blow your face off.
[01:54:00.330 --> 01:54:02.650]  I will never forget watching Kevin Jodry
[01:54:02.650 --> 01:54:05.170]  pass out smoking Death Star.
[01:54:05.170 --> 01:54:08.370]  He's sitting there slumped like this in a chair
[01:54:08.370 --> 01:54:11.450]  and literally no one can wake him up.
[01:54:11.490 --> 01:54:13.050]  People were sitting around him like,
[01:54:13.050 --> 01:54:16.450]  what the hell just happened to a guy
[01:54:16.450 --> 01:54:19.690]  who's like a pioneer of marijuana right there?
[01:54:19.690 --> 01:54:22.210]  And he could not get up for the life of him.
[01:54:22.210 --> 01:54:26.730]  It was the highlight of the Regen Conference.
[01:54:26.730 --> 01:54:30.250]  Yeah, that's not one you expect to see.
[01:54:30.250 --> 01:54:32.850]  No, not at all.
[01:54:32.850 --> 01:54:37.290]  It's like, damn, if you weren't so cool as Buff,
[01:54:37.290 --> 01:54:39.130]  it'd be great if I had a Sharpie right now.
[01:54:39.170 --> 01:54:41.050]  But no, I'm not going there.
[01:54:41.050 --> 01:54:42.250]  I'm not going there.
[01:54:42.250 --> 01:54:44.090]  If you have your shoes on, it's fair game.
[01:54:44.090 --> 01:54:46.250]  That's how I was brought up, man.
[01:54:46.250 --> 01:54:47.610]  If you're sleeping with your shoes on,
[01:54:47.610 --> 01:54:49.570]  you passed out and you deserve it.
[01:54:51.010 --> 01:54:52.330]  And that Corey Hayman,
[01:54:52.330 --> 01:54:57.090]  Stardog is one of the absolute best strings out there.
[01:54:57.090 --> 01:55:02.090]  I truly believe it is absolutely second to none
[01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:04.130]  in its own class in a lot of ways.
[01:55:04.130 --> 01:55:07.930]  And I have smoked some wonderful Stardog over the years
[01:55:07.930 --> 01:55:10.130]  and we're actually gonna do a project
[01:55:10.130 --> 01:55:11.530]  for Stardog stuff as well,
[01:55:11.530 --> 01:55:15.330]  because we have some really early late 2015,
[01:55:15.330 --> 01:55:18.690]  early 2016 stock of seeds
[01:55:18.690 --> 01:55:21.730]  and probably like about 80 to 100.
[01:55:21.730 --> 01:55:24.210]  And so we're gonna go ahead and run those
[01:55:24.210 --> 01:55:27.130]  and see what we can come up with Stardog wise as well.
[01:55:27.130 --> 01:55:28.570]  So we'll see.
[01:55:30.450 --> 01:55:31.290]  That's pretty good.
[01:55:31.290 --> 01:55:32.690]  My knee pads are already.
[01:55:32.690 --> 01:55:37.690]  I'm looking up.
[01:55:37.690 --> 01:55:39.770]  I don't have space cheese listed here.
[01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:42.090]  I'm looking on the seed finders website.
[01:55:43.330 --> 01:55:48.330]  Somebody had put up the mud bone cross in chat
[01:55:48.370 --> 01:55:50.570]  and somebody else had asked what the cross
[01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:55.090]  of the space cheese was.
[01:55:55.090 --> 01:55:58.930]  And I was looking up here at Mr. Toad stuff on here,
[01:55:58.930 --> 01:56:02.930]  but this was the mud bone.
[01:56:03.370 --> 01:56:04.850]  Oh, he's angel.
[01:56:04.850 --> 01:56:08.690]  Angel is actually that Mr. Nice that I had over there.
[01:56:08.690 --> 01:56:11.770]  I have his original stock angel as well.
[01:56:11.770 --> 01:56:12.930]  Nice, wow.
[01:56:12.930 --> 01:56:17.690]  So that is a gorgeous, super medicinal strain right there.
[01:56:17.690 --> 01:56:19.050]  And the cush is for me,
[01:56:19.050 --> 01:56:22.690]  like I have a lot of just like kind of stomach issues,
[01:56:22.690 --> 01:56:25.130]  like Bubba Cush, Burmese Cush,
[01:56:25.130 --> 01:56:28.690]  they both like, they chill my stomach the F out.
[01:56:28.690 --> 01:56:31.370]  So knowing that it was a part of it,
[01:56:31.410 --> 01:56:33.810]  I'm like, yeah, I totally already am interested in,
[01:56:33.810 --> 01:56:35.570]  you know, the medicinal potential of that.
[01:56:35.570 --> 01:56:37.850]  So yeah, this one had me really excited
[01:56:37.850 --> 01:56:41.730]  because again, you know, I view the plant as medicine
[01:56:41.730 --> 01:56:43.730]  and that's what I'm after.
[01:56:43.730 --> 01:56:46.210]  So that'll be fun to try.
[01:56:46.210 --> 01:56:47.410]  Absolutely, man.
[01:56:47.410 --> 01:56:48.570]  Absolutely.
[01:56:48.570 --> 01:56:49.410]  Yep.
[01:56:49.410 --> 01:56:51.450]  And I can ask him what the space cheese is
[01:56:51.450 --> 01:56:52.850]  or you can actually hit him up too.
[01:56:52.850 --> 01:56:54.450]  He's on Instagram.
[01:56:54.450 --> 01:56:55.330]  Yeah, I'll have to ask him.
[01:56:55.330 --> 01:56:56.410]  I'm not sure what it is,
[01:56:56.410 --> 01:56:58.970]  but I saw the same thing when I was over
[01:56:58.970 --> 01:57:00.690]  at that regen conference and I'm like,
[01:57:00.930 --> 01:57:03.130]  space cheese sounds good somehow, you know,
[01:57:03.130 --> 01:57:04.090]  with a death star.
[01:57:04.090 --> 01:57:06.370]  So I'm getting a lot of,
[01:57:06.370 --> 01:57:08.290]  let's go to outer space with this stuff.
[01:57:08.290 --> 01:57:10.610]  So I'm good with that.
[01:57:10.610 --> 01:57:12.770]  Totally, I'm good with that.
[01:57:12.770 --> 01:57:13.930]  Well said.
[01:57:13.930 --> 01:57:14.770]  Yeah, right?
[01:57:14.770 --> 01:57:15.610]  Right?
[01:57:15.610 --> 01:57:16.450]  Yeah.
[01:57:16.450 --> 01:57:17.530]  Well, how about Dave?
[01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:19.770]  I don't know, do you guys wanna throw up
[01:57:19.770 --> 01:57:23.450]  maybe one more pack and one more story
[01:57:23.450 --> 01:57:28.330]  before we head out for this session?
[01:57:28.330 --> 01:57:29.170]  Why not?
[01:57:29.210 --> 01:57:32.770]  What I wanna throw out there is the most recent battle
[01:57:32.770 --> 01:57:35.730]  I had with James over here.
[01:57:35.730 --> 01:57:37.210]  Uh oh, oh God.
[01:57:37.210 --> 01:57:38.050]  This is, this is,
[01:57:38.050 --> 01:57:40.370]  Pure Kush Sky Covered Double Kush.
[01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:41.210]  Yeah.
[01:57:42.130 --> 01:57:46.290]  This is from, it was a recent auction to benefit Nick
[01:57:46.290 --> 01:57:49.210]  over Lime Rising Farms that he had.
[01:57:49.210 --> 01:57:52.010]  He happens to get some special stuff in his possession
[01:57:52.010 --> 01:57:55.570]  and he got some Pure Kush Sky Covered Double Kush
[01:57:55.570 --> 01:57:57.810]  direct from Dean Jean himself.
[01:57:58.570 --> 01:57:59.410]  Wow.
[01:57:59.410 --> 01:58:00.930]  That was what the fight was for.
[01:58:00.930 --> 01:58:01.770]  Yeah.
[01:58:01.770 --> 01:58:06.770]  Although it's not in the mean Jean fancy packaging
[01:58:06.810 --> 01:58:08.290]  with his own special handwriting,
[01:58:08.290 --> 01:58:10.090]  which you know, it's like gold.
[01:58:10.090 --> 01:58:13.330]  Yeah, it's better with the little packs
[01:58:13.330 --> 01:58:14.810]  in the handwriting, let's be honest.
[01:58:14.810 --> 01:58:15.930]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[01:58:15.930 --> 01:58:19.730]  If it looked like that, it's just delicious,
[01:58:19.730 --> 01:58:20.810]  but it's okay.
[01:58:20.810 --> 01:58:22.770]  I know what it is, so we're okay.
[01:58:22.770 --> 01:58:23.970]  There you go.
[01:58:23.970 --> 01:58:25.450]  This is like my,
[01:58:25.450 --> 01:58:27.890]  this is my one chance at the Jerry Springer moment
[01:58:27.890 --> 01:58:29.970]  that I promised at the beginning of the episode.
[01:58:29.970 --> 01:58:33.170]  Like I wish we could get your face on here, Dave.
[01:58:33.170 --> 01:58:36.930]  So you could just be like, oh yes, look at this little pack.
[01:58:36.930 --> 01:58:38.530]  Oh, isn't it just the greatest?
[01:58:38.530 --> 01:58:41.130]  Oh, you're so cute, look at you.
[01:58:41.130 --> 01:58:45.010]  But that would require me wearing like a shirt right now.
[01:58:45.010 --> 01:58:45.850]  That's not, it's too hot.
[01:58:45.850 --> 01:58:48.130]  Oh, see, yeah, that's too much.
[01:58:48.130 --> 01:58:49.250]  That's too much for Dave.
[01:58:49.250 --> 01:58:51.130]  Yes, I was told the other day by Dave,
[01:58:51.130 --> 01:58:52.290]  it's too hot for leather.
[01:58:52.290 --> 01:58:54.810]  So hell, you know, it's hot.
[01:58:55.970 --> 01:58:59.490]  Oh man.
[01:58:59.490 --> 01:59:01.410]  Was that private, dude?
[01:59:01.410 --> 01:59:02.610]  I'm sorry.
[01:59:02.610 --> 01:59:04.530]  Nobody watches this show anyways.
[01:59:04.530 --> 01:59:06.370]  Nobody watches, dude, we're all good.
[01:59:06.370 --> 01:59:07.210]  We're all good.
[01:59:08.490 --> 01:59:10.970]  We didn't say what kind of leather, so we're good.
[01:59:12.050 --> 01:59:13.850]  We kept that out of things here.
[01:59:13.850 --> 01:59:16.770]  And now that I've taken it that route, James, no.
[01:59:17.930 --> 01:59:19.690]  Okay, here we go, it's coming off.
[01:59:21.330 --> 01:59:23.850]  Do you have one more pack that you'd like to show off?
[01:59:23.850 --> 01:59:26.610]  I do, actually, I have a couple things
[01:59:26.610 --> 01:59:29.090]  that are kind of fun to share here.
[01:59:29.090 --> 01:59:33.930]  Is some old Bob Hemphill crickets and cicada stuff,
[01:59:33.930 --> 01:59:38.050]  actually, that might be fun to see.
[01:59:38.050 --> 01:59:40.370]  So we got some Silk Road.
[01:59:41.210 --> 01:59:44.930]  We have some purple Hindu Kush crossed with Cabo Kush.
[01:59:46.330 --> 01:59:49.210]  We got the Nepali hash plant crossed with the puck.
[01:59:50.050 --> 01:59:55.050]  And then some red Lebanese hash plant crossed with the puck.
[01:59:55.730 --> 01:59:58.770]  And then the puck bat crossed.
[02:00:00.090 --> 02:00:04.170]  So one of the things that we do a lot of also
[02:00:04.170 --> 02:00:07.290]  is we do a ton of preservation, land, race, heirloom,
[02:00:07.290 --> 02:00:10.730]  genetics, we go through, I just got a whole bunch
[02:00:10.730 --> 02:00:15.130]  of Kashmir Asad and Jalalabad star work
[02:00:15.130 --> 02:00:17.290]  that we're gonna run through.
[02:00:17.290 --> 02:00:21.770]  So between that and like some of his Pakistani Peshawar
[02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:26.730]  stuff that Bodhi okayed for Graham to run is,
[02:00:27.690 --> 02:00:30.210]  you know, that kind of stuff we'd love to work through
[02:00:30.210 --> 02:00:35.210]  because there is so much that if you find the right phenos,
[02:00:35.210 --> 02:00:39.370]  you know, same with a guy like Snow High, for example,
[02:00:39.370 --> 02:00:43.610]  out your way, who's just a phenomenal guy as well.
[02:00:43.610 --> 02:00:47.090]  Those are areas where we can really transform
[02:00:48.090 --> 02:00:52.170]  and take the direction of what is, you know, very popular
[02:00:52.170 --> 02:00:54.610]  and be able to really, you know,
[02:00:56.010 --> 02:00:58.370]  evolve and compliment those strains
[02:00:58.370 --> 02:01:00.290]  that people are really enjoying
[02:01:00.290 --> 02:01:04.650]  by adding in these really unique cannabinoid profiles
[02:01:04.650 --> 02:01:07.250]  from these very unique regions
[02:01:07.250 --> 02:01:09.210]  that are hard to get your hands on.
[02:01:10.210 --> 02:01:11.050]  Yeah.
[02:01:11.050 --> 02:01:12.010]  Yeah.
[02:01:12.010 --> 02:01:15.570]  Like J2Cans just put up a pack for sale
[02:01:15.570 --> 02:01:20.330]  that was the brothers of the BOEL,
[02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:24.970]  BOEL pre-Soviet Afghani.
[02:01:24.970 --> 02:01:27.370]  And we have a few packs of those to run as well.
[02:01:27.370 --> 02:01:28.530]  There you go.
[02:01:28.530 --> 02:01:31.170]  That's what I'm talking about, Dave.
[02:01:31.170 --> 02:01:32.410]  I'm gonna finally get this right.
[02:01:32.410 --> 02:01:33.930]  That's the Snow High logo.
[02:01:33.930 --> 02:01:34.930]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:34.930 --> 02:01:36.130]  Yes.
[02:01:37.570 --> 02:01:41.770]  Those are some awesome things, but yeah, Joey or J2Cans.
[02:01:41.770 --> 02:01:44.090]  I just always wanna say Joey, Jimmy.
[02:01:44.090 --> 02:01:44.930]  I agree.
[02:01:45.290 --> 02:01:49.650]  J2Cans, we actually did a breeder profile with him
[02:01:49.650 --> 02:01:52.130]  on FCPO2.
[02:01:52.130 --> 02:01:55.410]  Actually it was me, Mr. Toad and him.
[02:01:55.410 --> 02:01:56.250]  Nice.
[02:01:56.250 --> 02:01:57.090]  So, uh-oh.
[02:01:57.090 --> 02:02:01.090]  So, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[02:02:01.090 --> 02:02:02.250]  I couldn't help myself.
[02:02:02.250 --> 02:02:03.410]  I'm sorry, man.
[02:02:04.330 --> 02:02:05.170]  Winner.
[02:02:07.090 --> 02:02:08.530]  I told you, he's got me beat.
[02:02:08.530 --> 02:02:11.170]  No, you can just tell that he and I are just,
[02:02:11.170 --> 02:02:14.890]  we are one mind when it comes to what is good out there
[02:02:15.850 --> 02:02:19.250]  and I take so many tips from watching Dave's work and stuff
[02:02:19.250 --> 02:02:24.250]  that it's awesome to have people like him
[02:02:24.410 --> 02:02:29.370]  to be able to bounce ideas off of and learn from
[02:02:29.370 --> 02:02:32.090]  and evolve our genetics along the way.
[02:02:32.090 --> 02:02:36.090]  So, it works out perfectly on both ends.
[02:02:38.170 --> 02:02:39.010]  This has been rad.
[02:02:39.010 --> 02:02:39.850]  I love you, brother.
[02:02:39.850 --> 02:02:40.970]  I love you too.
[02:02:40.970 --> 02:02:42.610]  I love you too.
[02:02:42.610 --> 02:02:44.250]  Especially shirtless.
[02:02:45.050 --> 02:02:47.050]  And with a broken keyboard.
[02:02:47.050 --> 02:02:47.890]  That's true.
[02:02:47.890 --> 02:02:48.730]  That's true.
[02:02:48.730 --> 02:02:51.330]  Shirtless and no keyboard.
[02:02:51.330 --> 02:02:52.690]  Dave, you are a God.
[02:02:53.610 --> 02:02:54.450]  Indeed.
[02:02:55.930 --> 02:02:56.770]  Oh, rad.
[02:02:58.770 --> 02:03:00.130]  You know, before we close it out,
[02:03:00.130 --> 02:03:02.530]  I'd just like to give both of you guys a chance
[02:03:02.530 --> 02:03:05.130]  to shout yourselves out,
[02:03:05.130 --> 02:03:06.970]  tell people where they can find you if you'd like
[02:03:06.970 --> 02:03:11.050]  and give a shout out to anybody if you feel so eager
[02:03:11.050 --> 02:03:12.970]  to get involved in the community.
[02:03:13.930 --> 02:03:16.450]  If you feel so inclined.
[02:03:16.450 --> 02:03:19.570]  Let's go ahead and do that before we wrap it up.
[02:03:20.490 --> 02:03:21.530]  Dave, you're the senior.
[02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:22.530]  I'll let you go last.
[02:03:22.530 --> 02:03:25.010]  We'll get James in here first.
[02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:26.930]  So please, man, let people know where they can find you.
[02:03:26.930 --> 02:03:31.290]  Yeah, so always, you can find us on Instagram
[02:03:31.290 --> 02:03:33.010]  at jointcultivation.
[02:03:33.970 --> 02:03:36.770]  We are really active on our Instagram.
[02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:39.530]  We also have a website that we're working right now
[02:03:39.530 --> 02:03:42.210]  on an educational blog series, actually.
[02:03:42.210 --> 02:03:46.410]  So we're getting into a lot of kind of
[02:03:46.410 --> 02:03:48.530]  some of the nitty gritty stuff that we talked about
[02:03:48.530 --> 02:03:51.170]  here this evening, talking about different phenotypes,
[02:03:51.170 --> 02:03:54.970]  what that means, some open pollination ideas,
[02:03:54.970 --> 02:03:58.410]  what is craft cannabis and why is there such a market
[02:03:58.410 --> 02:03:59.250]  for it?
[02:04:00.210 --> 02:04:02.970]  We really just kind of dial in a lot of that
