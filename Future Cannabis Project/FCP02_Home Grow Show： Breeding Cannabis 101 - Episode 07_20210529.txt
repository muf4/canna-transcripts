we are and we are live happy Saturday everyone we're here with a special third
edition of the month of the perfectly imperfect grow show and Chad why is that
that we have a third bonus episode this month because there's five Saturdays in
this month can you believe it five my mind these are it's like this is stuff
that I'm like teaching my kids about like days the week like 30 days in a
month but some months have 31 days and this this was a lesson I learned as
being a DJ and being a promoter you can't say every other week because stuff
like this happens so that's why I'm always like first and third Saturday of
every month come check us out but we actually had a really special opportunity
today to talk with mr. toad and so I was very excited about that I jumped all
over it you know breeding making seeds trying to make the next fire or just
self-sustain your cannabis crop for the future a lot of us are doing that these
days and I wanted to kind of cover some of the basic terminology that everybody
can use to communicate with one another just kind of you know science dudes they
like their terminology because it paints a clear picture of what they're
trying to express and when it comes to breeding there's a whole bunch of big
words and cool stuff but it does really help to know a lot of the basic
terminology so today our goal is to kind of lay out some of the basic framework
some of the basic keywords that you hear all the time things you can use in
conversation with everybody else in chat on the forum but like I said we also
have mr. toad here and that's freaking rad because he can go deeper than a
minor in the center of Antarctica's hole so brother thank you for joining us
today doing good man how y'all doing thanks for asking me on here appreciated
hundred percent glad to be offering any kind of information to anybody out there
glad to be learning from anyone that offers any back here so today should be
fun definitely yeah well thank you for joining and I'm gonna get my chat going
it looks like cheese crew is in the house from oz good to see you guys here
I'm gonna try to flip over without actually causing an audio bleed that's
always the the trick but yeah well basically kind of go ahead and we'll get
it started you know like I mentioned we have some terminology that we could kind
of go over we're gonna go over some of your experiences and here comes the okay
I got it let me pop out the chat here real quick guys I'm sorry okay but again
kind of wanted to start you know I have some of that basic stuff because not all
of us have access to a lab gene sequencers and stuff like that so yeah
well we'll get it going here and kind of when I say there we go and just yeah no
worries it'll it'll happen in and out today it's it's Memorial Day weekend so
everybody live out in the woods so my system out here is just getting rammed
by everybody that's not at work and out here so I have very little broadband
yeah yeah that happens definitely during the daytime okay so you know again kind
of like I said we're gonna get this started people they may ask me like do I
consider myself a breeder my answer is no I'm gonna qualify that like this
breeding is something that takes many many years it's not something that
you're gonna be able to do overnight it's not something you're gonna be able
to do in a couple of generations now it's okay to do that you have to start
somewhere and everybody is on their own path but respectful respectfully to the
breeders out there that have put in the work you know seven eight years on lines
no I don't consider myself a breeder but I'm a big fan of it and I love to talk
about it all day long so in my kind of simple world and all you know I'll turn
this over to mr. toad as well you know for the first basic two words that you
hear when you're talking about breeding or making seeds or looking at offspring
you got your genotype and your phenotype ah Peter long pipes is the man with the
words there so and and I'll let mr. toad go for this real quick my just you know
basic explanation of the two because they're important to know the difference
genotype is just an overall possibility me and my sister have the same genotype
now you could go deeper into that but basic we have the same potential of what
we're going to express now me and my sister are definitely different and
that's the phenotype the phenotype is more or less the expression that you're
gonna get and there's a variety of things that can bring that out feeding
environment etc etc but that is kind of a basic introduction to the words and
I'll turn it over to mr. toad to kind of expand on that and get you a better
understanding alright so what I'm gonna do is I like these Rubik's cubes because
they're visual people it's hard to see what our traits are because like he just
said you and your sister are both genotypes of say your last name is Smith
right we're just going to use that as the genotype of Smith and you and your
sister are both versions of that genotype but you yourselves are also
Smith genotypes and can have a phenotypical expression depending on
the environment they put you in so for me to show this where I'm going to use
this I got some pictures I downloaded I'm gonna show you folks I couldn't
send them across to you I was so damn busy and I was pretty sick yesterday so
I just printed them out so what I'm going to show you a rough off this is a
picture of a whole bunch of different Rubik's cube this is the gene pool that
we call whatever cannabis we want to call we were just using his brother and
sister so we'll stick with that we'll call it Smith this is the genotype with
the gene pool of Smith every single one of the West ports okay the West ports
the West ports right and every single one of these is a different genotype of
West port but this is the gene pool of West port you can have square ones round
ones triangle ones there can be black and white ones they're gonna be long
skinny ones like the long pipe version you know there can be all versions of
Rubik's Cube right these are all the gene pool they're all a genotype now if
I go in there and say I pull out one set of those right these are also
genotypes of Rubik's Cube but these are gonna have a smaller genetic pool to
offer so now I'm not gonna be able to get the round and the triangle and the
black and white because there are no alleles form in this version that I
pulled out of there I could also have pulled out a black and white set of
Rubik's Cubes out of there also a genotype now the phenotypal expression
of them would be like if we actually took our hands and turned the panel one
time our hand is the environment that caused a brand new phenotypal expression
of that genotype it's still the same genotype but now all the arrows now
aren't pointing in the same direction because we've spun it once and then our
gardens that could be heat right and say we spin it twice now that's heat and
pest pressure or we stare three times that's heat pest pressure and
overwatering and each one of those is going to affect which way the arrows or
the lines are gonna line up in the genotype that we've selected out of a
gene pool that says a set of seeds like my ganjo G or my space cheese those
would be the gene pool each seed that came out of there is a brand new
genotype because it has a mix of genes in a different random order than the
original parent plant even if you make a s1 of it and now this plant is going to
offer different ways to breed through that genotype so if we leave them open
populating like this we're gonna end up with is a like like this one here say
this is in South Africa and this one over here is in Colombia and these ones
over here were in Australia now we have different ecotypes of the genotype that
was can the species of cannabis that that gene pool being selected in the
different areas now gives us different genotypes of the original gene pool so
the ones in Australia now like they have animals over there that are completely
different than anywhere else it shows it the most you're gonna end up with brand
new gene pools that cannot ever replicate the original gene pool because
of what becomes known as the founders effect so when you go in and take a
smaller selection of the whole you end up with a genetic pool that doesn't have
the potential to breed all of the alleles that were available in the
original pool so to show like the magnitude of the alleles you can use a
Rubik's Cube like this with a ton of different squares right and you see this
one has two different shapes squares long and small so on this one the small
one would be the homozygous trait because it's going to pass most office
and the shorter ones are going to be the heterozygous traits and then you could
say these corner ones would be the ones that are going to show a little bit of
both but you don't know which way they would breed so you can have a homozygous
recessive which is going to have two copies of the recessive allele or
homozygous dominant which is going to have two copies of what is the dominant
trait and that's hard to tell in what plants some plants are going to be
dominant for purple some will be green some are tall some are short and with
our dye hybrids that we're messing with which is what we're doing with the
cannabis these days most of us are crossing polyhybrids which means they're
going to have more than one true breeding parent line so they're just a
dye hybrid so you'll have a plant that breeds for tall and short and wide and
blue it's good in the cold weather all these things are going to be separate
and different than the parents you breed it to so you start ending up with so
many different alleles that could pop out of these crosses that a lot of
people are believing that they're true breeding through some lines that
basically are don't offer that without years of breeding and back crossing to
reoccurring parents to lock in certain traits and not genotypes it's going to
lock in traits from the genotype but if you want that genotype you need to open
populate as many of the original stock that you can get your hands on so that
you have the the possibility like you said to express anything that comes from
the Westbrook genotype right like your dad might be tall your grandfather might
be small and your sister like she's a female and you're a male these are all
different genotypical expressions of the gene pool that's Westbrook and now you
take you and put you in Alaska or put you in Africa and you're going to have a
different phenotypical expression on your skin you're going to get a tan you
may end up with less nutrients in your body being a one spot or the other so
now you're going to grow taller or smaller you know what I mean it can
affect your hormone regulation this is why people like in the early 19th
century were a lot shorter they had nutrient deficiencies and weren't able
to grow to the size that a lot of us are these days because of the way they
put minerals and stuff in all our food so when a person doesn't get enough food
or correct nutrients your bones don't grow your hair may not grow you yourself
may not grow this happens to a plant these are all abiotic stresses that can
cause different phenotypal expressions which is just a turning of your Rubik's
Cube so say this one little allele right here is for a more for didic expression
and if it pops up on top it's going to express itself that's just what happens
and there's no way for a breeder myself to lock that one small trade out of the
line now if the lines minotious and is already showing that you just don't
breed with a line like that but there's abiotic stresses that can like I said
watering heat root bound too much light your daylight integral factors too high
too much UV specific spectrums that can affect all these things I can take these
new traits which you have a leels and jeans the jeans is like the yellow and
the allele is an alternate version of that gene which is going to be say a
dark yellow or light yellow so it's going to give you a different expression
of that gene on the marker that's there so each time you don't know what's going
to pop up there you can't see the allele you're going to be able to tell that
through breeding it to find out if that's going to pop out and the
frequency of which which is something you're going to find by the Hardy
Weinberg equation we can it's the P's and Q's of breeding basically where you
take the frequency of the dominant and recessive alleles that are coming out
of the jeans actually start with the genotype the recessive or dominant
genotype in a line so say a line breeds purple or green and it dominates purple
70% of the time so that's going to be your P as your dominant and your Q is
always your recessive so on this it would be 30 and the P and Q always have
to equal 1 which is the entity that you're you're trying to figure out its
traits from the cannabis plant it can be 1 it can be 100 it could be a thousand
and 1 is 1 trait 100 is going to be 100 traits right so each one can be put into
the equation tell you what genotype is going to show the most frequent and from
there you can go and find out which one of the alleles is going to pop up at
what percentage and what frequency so from that I've got it written out here
it's it's it's fucking hard it's p2 plus 2 pq plus q squared so when I said we
had 70 and 30 the P was 0.3 it doesn't have to be the one that shows up the
most it just has to be what breeds dominant so if you plant breeds
dominant for a certain allele the percentage here was was 3 out of the out
of the 10 that we did so we got 0.3 which comes out to what it's actually 20
I forgot it at a 20 so at a 20 the point 3 breaks down to point zero 9 which is
9% of the time you're going to get the dominant plant that's going to have both
so it's always going to breed for that trait in the middle when you multiply 2
times P which was 3 times 0.7 you get 0.4 to 42% of the time you're going to
get something that looks like the dominant trait but it also carries a
recessive trait which means it's going to breed heterozygous so 42% of the time
you have heterozygous plants coming out of these F2s from the polyhybrid and
then the recessive trait comes out of there at 0.7 you divide that into there
it comes out at 0.49 which is 49% all these added up 49 plus 42 plus 9 equal
100 which equals 1 same thing hundreds 1 and that's the allele frequencies of the
trait that you're after not all the traits this is just one specific trait
it could be green it could be webbed leaf it could be root restriction issues
whatever you're breeding for this stuff comes down to some serious math on the
theoretical side now to put it into practice it's a little bit different
you're not going to be able to just break these numbers down and that's
exactly what you're going to get because nature says you're not in charge right
nature's nature has put stuff in there that's going to make your plant turn
homorphodite or it's going to throw in atavistic traits which means basically
great-great-grandfather which are traits that came from the line farther
back that you didn't even see wasn't part of the parents or even the
grandparents and all of a sudden shows up where you like you picked all these
you got all these colored Rubik's Cubes and all of a sudden you get this Rubik's
Cube because it's an atavistic trait that popped out and you've been breeding
for purples and blues right and what's happened is is each one of these cubes
is an allele and since each side has a specific pattern right those alleles are
either going to be the same for the genotype or an alternate version so like
all of a sudden this one is said having lines ends up with an arrow because it
just popped out of nowhere because some abiotic stress in the system told this
plant that it needed to send out a brand new trait to help itself and maybe
environment maybe you were getting bug pressure and this turned on a trait in
the plant maybe you've been spraying too damn much you're putting too many
chemicals on the plant and the plant has decided it needs to turn on a brand new
defense mechanism and because that allele is on a set of genes on the DNA
it may automatically start kicking other shit on your plant you might start
getting purples to show up maybe the leaf structure starts to change and
you're getting different blades on the shape of your plant that's all common
from a stress that's being triggered from from those stresses and your plants
reacting to it
just quickly because visuals are always helpful to everybody so in the Westport
family example we have a sister
and then we have Chad
Chad sister
ok so that is really great because I'm a big visual learner like visual aids
help me a lot in the Rubik's Cube was great in that scenario the Rubik's Cube
was a genotype and every twist was a phenotype every twist is also a genotype
the phenotype comes from that you know like if you twist it once and start
breeding those everything that comes from that's a brand new genotype but
that genotype can express differently in different garden so you take a clone of
this new plant from seed that is a genotype of you it's a subset genotype
of your gene pool because the original gene pool isn't actually the genotype
just a gene pool of what's available there that's why I show pictures of
multiple different large groups of what the picture was probably so so what that
mean basically every new seed run that you do it's a new genotype every seed in
that run and like you buy a 10-pack every one of those seeds is a
genotypical expression of what was available from the parental cross so
like these are all the gene pool so you can have any type of Rubik's Cube like I
didn't do all of them but there's a shitload there's small there's big there's
but the gene pool of Rubik's Cube is the gene pool today we call cannabis which
covers all the plants from land races to man to everything we're bringing from
the dudes in the closets that are chucking the whatever you want to call
it that whole gene pool is cannabis and has the ability to express some form of
the genetic possibility from it but if we only like say this is a giant garden
and it's on one continent right it's a huge continent we're gonna call the
continent Mary Jane right it's 10,000 square kilometers Mary Jane it's covered
with genotype cannabis the gene pool and we get five minutes to run on there and
grab as many seeds as we can from the gene pool called Mary Jane now we run on
there and because it's so big we only have the ability to grab seeds from
right here right okay now we take this and go back to where we are and that
genotype is now becoming the founder effect where you take a small population
of the original gene pool and start to breed with it now because I took it from
right here it can only breed these these ones right and versions of it and since
those don't have any round Rubik's Cubes or any long Rubik's Cubes or triangle
Rubik's Cubes there's no neon Rubik's Cube you cannot get those alleles to come
from this cross they're not available so you're only going to be able to cross
versions of what's available in here your genes pool becomes smaller and
smaller so eventually we'll just continue we'll call that just call that
cookies island so eventually you get to a point where you end up with this right
you get a Rubik's Cube that's got two colors and it can't breed nothing else
no more and it doesn't have the ability to fight off bugs and the cold flux with
it all right and if you give it one twist it breaks so it nature kills this
plant because you have removed all of the gene pool that was available to turn
traits on and off for specific abiotic stresses that the plant and nature
decided I need to have to continue to replicate that's all nature cares about
with this plant first is to replicate second is to sequester carbon and third
is to enlighten you that you yourself are nothing but a growing entity on this
earth and you are nothing special if you do not do what you were put here to do
correctly right if you fuck around and jerk off like I did for a long time you
lose a fucking leg right I fucked around in my my phenotypical expression now has
changed even though I'm still the genotype label I have a brand new
phenotypical expression because of stresses that I allowed to happen to my
body so I use me as a physical example so if you do it right your single Rubik's
Cube could still look like this right but it can only breed earth's now even
though it's a single genotypical expression but you did it correctly now
so now it has versions of itself instead of just white and red so right genotype
plus and phenotype yeah exactly that's exactly right
phenotype is always the expression of the environment from the genotype
and how about chemotype because that's something that comes up a lot to you
know mainly a lot of the papers that I'm reading they don't necessarily talk
about like an indica or sativa anymore it's a chemotype a lot about that how
does that kind of fit into the equation well chemotypes also going to come down
to every single plant having a different version and it can change slightly
depending on the environment the chemotype can be changed and swayed based
on the spectrum of light you put above it and the nutrients that you are
running through the system and and pest pressure like if you can raise the
systemic acquired resistance or the jasmonic response in your plant you're
going to get a plant that's going to increase its trichome density its
chemical response so now your terpene level goes higher which means the
chemovar changes right the chemical status of that plant doesn't stay stat
it's gonna stay at it's gonna make the same chemicals they're just gonna change
in the volume usually so the chemovar is just basically the chemicals that
that plant produces in the trichome its oils its its waxes the epidural or
everything that's on there is a different chemical that plants producing
what's in the the enzymes and its floam and xylem everything that plant in its
system is a different chemical makeup that makes that exact plant specific and
different than the one next to it so that's why you would hunt through say a
bunch of can of tonic to find a specific version that was giving you
this exact CBD to THC ratio that now also breeds true for that but you can
change that again like I said you put it in a room that's only grown with a high
amount of red light it's gonna produce a different chemical makeup than a room
that or even outdoors you know you put it outside and you get a higher amount
of UV on that plant like a THC V cultivar they will produce a higher level
THC V outdoors as compared to they do inside under a artificial lighting
schedule the way I've always thought about chemotype is like if if you're the
sound engineer for like the Rolling Stones each song you have like your 64
channel sound exactly song number one you want like heavy bass right so that
would be like turk exact number seven but you want to bring like the snare
down and the same equalizer can about just a little bit of this turf like a
hint of this turpene a hint of that chirping a lot of a ton of CBD like Mick
Jagger's booming like but then the next song you want to like readjust everything
you're like oh we need but then I know changes based on the the venue you're at
so if you're at an amphitheater outside some of those levels have to be
increased if you're in door in a small place like the hard rock at in Nevada
right it's a real small tiny little venue so now you have to turn down some
of those things it's the same chemo bar but if you add too much of that base it
overshadows all the CBD and doesn't work correctly because of the what we know is
the entourage effect is going to take effect now so now when you raise a
specific ratio of one of the chemicals that plant produces because of the
environment again like I said a venue if we're going to use the music as the same
thing to me that venue has an effect on the sound which changes against a
phenotypical expression the chemo bar does stay constant like it's not going
to suddenly just stop making THC because you change the lights but the level of
that THC changes based on the grower we all know one grow we can give ten clones
to ten people and have them all grown and one dude's gonna grow them great one
guy's gonna grow some mids right and then they're all gonna bitch that it
wasn't genetics or it was the breeder right and yes I'll take I've made some
shitty-ass crosses right and I know some people that have but can like name
five of them right now that you guys know just five grows that you've had
that were complete failures because the breeder fucked up like you can't do it
you're not gonna be able to find it because if you keep buying seeds from
the same dude that fucked up you're the fuck up
you booth and you're paying for booth and you're pissed off about booth and
tape poof that's what it's about yeah and this is you know another argument
for people needing to take their time before they start selling their seeds
I've never sold a single one and I don't intend to I'll give them away but yeah
guys do your things and and kind of Peters analogy is funny it brings me
back because again I am the audio engineer and we did have the big 64
track need consoles and it's cool because that shit is all automated every
different song I've pre-programmed it and I just have to sit back and the
faders go up the faders go down based on what song that I'm programming in and
that could be like the gardens that you pre mix soil that you know one plant
needs more nitrogen and needs more cows never yeah that's the same thing but
here's what's also different besides venue you got different dudes mixing
the same shit so one guy likes he just he can't hear right so he adds more shit
right right for real and this all changing everything phenotype and
everything like when a guy starts to feel when his job is not to feel and do
then that's when shit gets fucked up so with some guy that's supposed to be
cutting the Rolling Stones sound at the fucking at the concert all of a sudden
starts cutting it for like some Willie Nelson tracks and it just don't sound
right he's not gonna keep his job but he's gonna bitch that it was the music
right now homie you what the fuck were you doing bro we were trying to put a
groove on anything wrong with Willie Nelson I love the dude but that's that's
what I'm saying if one cat decides to put his own spin on something that's
supposed to be a specific way to have specific outcomes and then you complain
about the outcome because you didn't do it the specific way there there's an
issue in there like that's when you start to educate yourself that maybe
there's something more driving this besides me and the guy that I bought
seeds from there's something in between that interaction and my plants finishing
that may have had an issue with my garden right 50% chance it's me 50%
chance it's you but like when people are wrong they never want to show that wrong
right they don't put it out there and tell everybody I fucked up look what
happened because then that helps another person but they never think of it that
way they think it's gonna hurt their image or what maybe they'd be able to
offer to someone else and what we've all started learning the more you share
your mistakes the more people are gonna trust you when you do offer your
positive stuff yeah making making mistakes is really one of the best ways
to learn it's if you can do everything perfect that's great but honestly I was
just gonna say the one thing I've always thought about it is that kind of
chemotype from forget the rec market but like in the medical market the
chemotypical expression of whatever it is I'm about to purchase as defined by
the lab results should be should be what I'm buying on because like blue dream
bought in 50 different dispensaries if you actually tested it's not the same
stuff and if someone's depending on a chemotypical like this much of flavonoid
a this much of flavonoid this much of this much of terpene like like you want
that exact chemical yeah and that's you an ingredients and that's why and that's
why science is looking at it that way and we've got you know a really educated
chat room I saw the gr420 community videos chemotype is basically chemical
expressions absolutely cascadian grown was talking about type 1 type 2 and type
3 you know that's your THC your CBD and then the combo there's type 4 and type
5 also so 5 would have no THC and type 4 I want to say is a CBG CBG only so
there's type 1 2 3 4 and 5 and this is this is really how science use it and I
mean ultimately if we're gonna you know jump the moon here real quick this is
how people are gonna patent stuff in the future they're gonna be able to happen
yeah I still a only ills turn on and turn off particular things to get a
designer chemotype or chemo bar and then once they have that it goes to Pat
because they look into China China has over 300 patents on cannabis already so
as soon as we get a worldwide trading of this plant if they think that they're
not gonna start trying to do stuff with money with can like cannabis is the next
industrial revolution but even bigger this can replace everything that all the
other revolutions tried to put together right except man that's the only thing
they can't replace with cannabis is the human being because they need someone to
buy this shit so they're never gonna get rid of us right and they need someone to
dish it out to when they're dying and that's what's coming with regulated
cannabis but like you said they're gonna start patenting and Leo combinations
they're gonna patent the mutations that come out of the plant they're gonna
they've already patent the ways that they breed the plants to get these
traits out of it if you go look there are there are already patents for the
breeding techniques and the way you guys are watering your plants like flood
and drain tables they've got patents on all this setups which can affect a
worldwide market when they start to regulate it on that level which is
what's coming because the more you guys want to have legal cannabis instead of
having just access to cannabis the more they're gonna regulate to you and give
it to you we when it was medical as 215 it was set up better than anything you
could have had man we could have sold it and traded it gave it and smoked it
anywhere we wanted to as long as you had a script and you could have got one
of those things if he was breathing like for real they were giving them out
everywhere over here I used to I ran a club man we had a doctor's office right
next to us and every 15 minutes someone was coming out with a script and then
they'd come into our place because literally our walls were touching and
they'd walk right in there they thought it was our place I'm like that's not our
doctor man we don't know who that dude is but if it's legal in California we
have to take it right so we take them we would check that we call the doctor
the doctor would verify them and we're like okay I don't know what to do if
he's a real doctor we got to take it but like people were coming in with it was
scripts for like I got a script because I had to get a script like it was too
much trouble people that's what killed my like yeah yeah yeah we tried to
regulate it in my town and we offered to the police and the sheriff here to have
a system that was set up so that every patient was given a number you didn't
have your name tagged to it or your medical condition just the fact that you
had a state approved recommendation for cannabis it didn't put down any limits
or nothing on there at all but it would tag you to a system where you would like
if you came to my shop and bought I would put it in the system that you
bought a specific amount patient number 47 and then like you would go next door
and try to buy another ounce down the system would say you could not buy
another ounce today because the ordinance here said you can only buy one
ounce of cannabis a day from a shop so that was a way for us to try to stop it
and they wouldn't even sign on to it like we don't want nothing to do with
selling cannabis and shit and that's in the year one but by year four they were
sending their officers to us that were actually injured and that were either
retired or weren't gonna be on the job for like a year from the injury and they
would send them there to get cannabis at our shop because we were the only shop
that started to follow every rule that the city put on us they were trying to
shut us down and we were the biggest shop there so they're figuring like
every what we'll put a they have to have 24-hour security even when they're not
open they have to have pay for police to fail the whole area and we're like dude
we tried to pay for new cops we tried to give them we're like we'll pay for two
cops for you to hire in the city we don't care where you put them doesn't
have to be near us you can go put them on the other side put them by the school
wherever you need them and we will pay the salary for them they didn't want
nothing to do with that I mean like my city was terrible with cannabis they
were one of the last cities that was down for camp like it was going out of
style man they just were here to shaft you any way possible and then they tried
to relax it for a certain amount of time we got up to 27 clubs in my town which
was absurd for the amount of people we have yeah and we've got less than 200
thousand people in the whole area so like it was insane the amount of people
that opened up clubs because all you had to have was a business license and go
past their background check if you could do that they would let you open a club
and we had 27 clubs going at one time and I was vending to 17 of them while I
was running another one and I was trying to keep them on point like none of them
were reading laws none of them like they didn't know they could sell hash or give
it off for hash to any of their customers because it was a concentrate
and I'm like did you guys need to start reading the laws it says specifically in
there that you can have any form of cannabis as long as it wasn't chemically
extracted with some form of chemical solvent besides and it had it listed on
their water or air if you had those two you could sell whatever you wanted I'm
like make all the bubble has you guys want what are you talking about and then
one of my buddies got busted here that worked for us and they tried to give him
a felony for one gram of hash and when he went to court the judge basically
tells him what are you doing this that's legal he's got a script he can
have whatever he wants he could have had because our city made us start putting
limits of how much cannabis he had diabetes and his doctor put nine
thousand nine hundred ninety nine ounces the judge is like he could have
nine thousand nine hundred nine nine ounces in Shasta County brother so like
the cops fucked up and didn't know what they were doing when they did that yeah
that passed everybody in town every club started to offer the hash because of
that one case in our town damn damn that's that's kind of crazy yeah but
I'm glad she doesn't watch this show but bringing it back you know we were
talking about the future of you know evil patents and all this stuff let's
bring it back to the very beginning and go with land races I always I have this
joke I always say the New Jersey land race but what does it actually mean to
you well and race does it just have to be old does it have to be from somewhere
very specific a land race is not the original cannabis that would be the
genotype cannabis it has it is not it's the eco type right so you take the
genotype cannabis it could exist anywhere when you take some of that
genotype and take it to Australia or say to South America it now becomes an
ecotype of that area if it's wild no man involved it's wild ecotype now if a man
up and collects a large population of those seeds and takes it to a different
segregated area that will not let them intermingle the original population and
the one he just took and he lets that open populate repeatedly for a long time
not just one or two years not ten years we're talking maybe a hundred years
maybe 200 years this now becomes a land race strain for that area becomes
acclimated for the environment that it's in it breeds a wide genotype so
they're not all gonna be purple they're not all gonna be short they're not all
gonna be high in THC you're gonna find different genetic variations through the
whole gene pool that you have selected from like you and your sister right they
both you both came out of the exact same possible pairing but are completely
different in your own right that's what happens when you take those to another
area and let them breed without selecting a single male and a single
female all you're basically doing is allowing them to get watered you are
breeding for us like the whole group for a specific reason like you want them to
be high in THC that produce a lot of resin but you're not specifically picking
phenol number one and phenol 47 right so once you've done that for maybe a hundred
years or more you're gonna end up with what they're calling a land race now that
land race population like say you've got a group of a thousand people that are in
that area where they took that land race and made it and each like ten families
from that group are allowed to go in and take some seeds theirself another subset
of seeds from this land race that was created there and are allowed to farm it
in their own separate little regions that now do not again repopulate with
the originals and these people now are going to be able to steer those in a
whole brand new direction but the genotype begins to get smaller and
smaller each time that you pull a population out because if you don't get
some of every possible genetic combination you lose it if the plant
does not have it like again we go to the Rubik's Cube if all of a sudden you
decided you'd like black and white and you only take the black and white Rubik's
Cube eventually you're not going to be able to breed any colored Rubik's Cube
out of there and that's where the found effect that comes in from going from
the land race and you start breeding it to one specific direction but you could
also heirloom it so like those guys took a bunch of them and they don't breed
them to that black and white they just let their population that they got from
the land race start to repopulate now that becomes an heirloom for that family
it doesn't become registered they've held it for maybe 40 or 50 years and it
does specific things and now this like in the cannabis world we could call this
either ABC or the freak show right these plants become outlier populations
that are their brand new own genotype that breed homozygous recessive traits
so you'll have to breed them to plants that are going to have dominant traits
over their recessive one and then in the f2 you'll find phenotypes that show that
recessive trait that you can either back cross to the original parent the
reoccurring one or start to make new filial generations that will increase
the allele frequency that carries that exact trait that you're looking for so
that you can breed line breed for that generation or to that genotype a brand
new genotype that's going to express like ABC or freak show where you've got
very serrated leaf or you've got very small tiny leaf where they're completely
different from cannabis but yet still cannabis and so and so kind of with the
land races it's not a person or people coming in and making the selection it's
maker nature making the selections based on the strongest and no man's man would
be involved man is involved with land race that's what makes it a land race
there but the man is not selecting single phenotypes from the population to
breed toward that specific expression so like if we buy a hundred granddaddy
purple seeds and we pop them they're all gonna express slightly different you
just keep open populating for the granddaddy purple genotype but you don't
select for any specific ones out of the group and you do this repeatedly this
becomes a land race when you do it yourself you don't do it if man doesn't
do it it stays a wild eco type in that area and has nothing to do with being
bred in any direction at all like it's not trying to save any particular
genotype it just wants the whole gene pool when you a land race is going to
select for a specific set of genotypes from that gene pool over a set of time
and then that's going to give you plants that are or animals that are going to be
acclimated to that specific area and they're gonna start to breathe true for
the traits that you selected for but it's still gonna be a larger population
it's not going to give you only purple plants and it's not gonna give you only
tall plants would you agree with this definition I'm trying to read it it's on
my phone man hold on I can enlarge it I didn't know land race redirect to your
specific breeders specimens of a land race lend to be genetic yeah they're
similar but diverse like I said they're gonna look alike but like Chad and his
sister they're similar but that they're diverse right so like if you leave them
on an island long enough you've got the genotype of Westbrook right and
eventually that outlier sister pops up and and and we're left with with Garth
popping up repeatedly if we start to breed the Garth right we can we can
line breed to that version of a sister if we want to it just takes a little bit
of time we're gonna have to find a version of Chad that looks exactly like
a sister or very close you know beautiful hair and teeth that were
there and we end up getting alleles to start to increase the replication and
eventually you will get more but only if the population offered it to begin with
if you've already gotten rid of Chad sister because you didn't like her
beautiful teeth and hair then she's never gonna show up again so okay
land races come completely from of the wild eco type of the gene pool of
cannabis and like a dude that's in Australia more than likely is going to
try like originally would have been working with stuff from Australia he
wouldn't have access to Africa so that's where the eco type that comes
from different locations comes into effect on the genotype we call cannabis
the gene pool so okay so in a nutshell anytime somebody says it's a wild land
race we don't know what we now know differently and that's important because
you're saying it's a eco type a wild eco type of the gene pool of cannabis and
they should never say it's an indica or sativa unless the plant came from India
and it's an indica and all cannabis that we've cultivated that isn't a wild eco
type is sativa it means cultivated the fact that we are growing this plant on
purpose makes it a cultivated plant which makes it sativa it's a tiva does
not describe leaf shape it does not scribe how long or tall the plants going
to be the flowering period the high type it just means that it's Latin terms
sativa sativa or sativas it means cultivated crop like rice is a sativa
you've got the honeybee that's from India it's an indica apis indica so like
we've got to start using correct words if we want to we want to expand this and
go forward we want the future cannabis to be something besides a cow and mag
from the past we should decide to start using something like use a brand new
word today like use something that like die hybrid today instead of calling your
f1 and f1 call it a die hybrid what it is because that thing has about 16
different genetic lines in it ain't gonna be true for none of them over one
year or two year period that your friends online have created if they're
trying to tell you even if they're f4s and it's got parentages that are not
related you're working with the plant that isn't breeding true for all of its
traits you still got yourself a polyhybrid which is awesome but we all
act like we're out here with registered plants that we're selling like tomatoes
Cherokees or sweet 100s like we are not replicating what's in our packs when you
pop them and grow them again that's what an f1 tells you automatically yeah let's
let's let's go there three three words here we keep we keep using a whole bunch
homozygous heterozygous and then we haven't used it but we said a bunch of
other words for it but heterosis so homozygous same same expression every
time if I pop and this is typically the point to where I consider a line being
bred to stability is I can pop ten seeds and nine point nine of those are gonna
have the same expression heterozygous is going to be different expressions you're
gonna see a lot more variation in the things that you're doing and then back
to you kind of what we're talking about here heterosis heterosis basically is
what another word for hybrid vigor its terminology yeah and you want to and
mr. toad I know you've done a lot of excellent breeding can you tell me this
if something here fits because with heterosis you don't want to breed like
and this is just an example you don't want to breed like a wedding cake and
like a you know birthday cake together because they're gonna be very similar
when you get things on the opposite ends of the spectrum like one that leans
really one way another means the other way you combine the two is that when you
get the heterosis or the hybrid rigor yes it shows us is going to come from
breeding things that aren't related it does not come from plants that are
related they need to be unrelated they're gonna give you a hybrid vigor
you're gonna end up with plants that represent a little bit of everything in
the blind but a majority are going to show a hybrid vigor that's a combination
of the the most dominant alleles from the two parents that you used and since
they don't it's them not being related helps in the fact that it's going to be
harder for bad alleles to line up because they're not going to either be
there or they're going to be on a whole different section of the DNA chain and
not have the ability to affect that trait to actually be expressed so the
heterosis happening is what's causing other bigger grows better than the both
parents that it came from it's going to handle pest pressure better everything
about that plant should be better than both parents for it to be heterosis but
it can also be bad so but it just basically means that you've crossed two
plants and they're going to give you a hybrid vigor out of there they're just
non-related you got the homozygous this means you got plants that are going to
carry two copies of an allele so it has the ability to pass it across as a
dominant so homozygous can be dominant or recessive which means the trait
either breeds dominant like say tall or the plant breeds recessive which is
going to be short and the recessive homozygous means it carries two alleles
for that recessive gene always being able to pass it a dominant gene means
it's got two of the large like we said here it's going to pass one of them so
when you get the progeny from that you could have a large like capital T or you
could have a capital T and a small T or two capital T's now the two capital T's
are going to show as a dominant plant now plants going to breed dominant it
appears dominant the recessive plants going to have two small T's it's going
to look short it's going to breed short then you got a plant in the middle that's
heterozygous that's going to carry a large allele and a small allele this
plant there's no way for you to tell whether or not it's going to breed for
either one of those it could pass a large or a small inbreeding you could
cross it to another plant and all of a sudden some of them are short and some
of them are tall because it does not breed true for either one of those
traits it's the heterozygous trade out of there so just because something said
it's recessive does not mean it cannot pass one breeding it just means it's not
expressed in the population on a high enough frequency to be considered the
dominant gene in there or some of the other genes in there just through nature
will be dominant like blue eyes and brown eyes right there's different
things or people that are like short people that have been born with like
a conjugation and stuff like that they get a different allele that's a new
version of that genetic code and it shows them to express a whole different
version of what was there to start with so you get two tall people that have a
baby that is a little person and it's just a new allele version of that
genetic code that came out of there like yellow eyes or green eyes you can have a
whole different shape and an allele real quick so allele is part of the DNA
which is inside of the genome which is inside of the haploid and the allele is
basically the instructions for particular functions like there's an
allele specifically for THC there's an allele for enzymes and different traits
that can pop out of their alleles they're just alternate versions of the
the genes that are in the plant so like if the gene of the plant says it needs
to make THC but one of the allele says it needs to make more THC right for a
specific reason so it the plant starts to kick in overdrive and that one
specifically now will become a new chemo var a new genotype and can have
different phenotypical expressions in every garden you put it in but until you
test it like you were talking about earlier if we don't start having access
to testing these plants to find the true medicinal properties of every single one
and the breeding properties we're just shooting in the darks right and we could
we could be shooting ourself in the foot and it's just hard for us to do that if
you don't have a large population of patients to run your stuff through or
access to genetic sequencing your breeding is really just visual and and
with your nose right and and it's only with you if you're not going to send out
your line to 45 people to see if their sickness isn't affected by it you you'll
never learn this kind of stuff you just guessing that it works right breeding
with a bubble because other people used it and they said it worked for appetite
doesn't mean your cross is going to do the same thing right it might but it
does not mean that right and to just believe it automatically without
experience with those plants that's what makes an educated breeder different from
someone that's just trying to make as many seeds as possible right you don't
have to be putting in a hundred years to breed if you've decided to lay down a
specific reason to do what you're after and you can get that outcome with only
one set of plants that's breeding right as long as what you're trying to do has
an outcome that you can actually accomplish your breeding right but don't
think that you're buying polyhybrids out there and making true breeding lines
from them and in the short amount of time unless you've got multiple breeding
areas to do this and a lot of area to start to dig through that system to find
what you're actually after right like we were talking about this in one of my
posts about how many plants it's needed to ensure no bottlenecking and to ensure
the saving of the genotype that's there and there's different numbers from like
sun grown minted posted some work from 172 and I found some paperwork that goes
up to a number of close to 5000 depending that's how many seeds you
would have to pop and run through to save the genotypical expression of the
gene pool that you're after unless you're just trying to back cross to a
specific phenotype and genotype and just save a crinkled leaf and high THC right
that's really that's real easy to do but that doesn't make it a true breeding
line it just makes it a line that true breeds for two traits so a couple a
couple things that I wanted to get in here to one I get confused a lot of
times you mentioned like polyhybrids and then just hybrids I want to cover that
they're actually yeah let's do that and then I wanted to go to the bottleneck
effect too because a bottleneck essentially real quick I see a question
in chat that's where you know it bottlenecks you get less expressions
yeah that's when you get that Rubik's Cube with two colors on it right yeah
that's bottlenecking and now it can't express nothing and it can't fight off
anything in the environment because what has happened is you have decided to
breed that thing to a position of inferior status and nature decides that
check it out bro we don't need you around here no more you're making us bad
you're bringing pests around here because your chemical signature says
that it's time to eat right or like you can't handle the cold so you could you
can end up with this one it's like monocropping yeah or you can end up with
this one that's the bottleneck effect when you look at a Rubik's Cube and it
started off with that original Rubik's Cube which this one but because you like
blue too much right and all you kept reading for was blue you ended up with
this fucking black and white Rubik's Cube right here because our bottleneck
and founder effect similar same or found effect is what's gonna lead you to start
to bottleneck because the founder effect is when you take a smaller yeah there
you go it's a smaller population from the larger one and now it does not have
the ability to show you any of those variations like I said there's no round
ones available there's no square or triangle when we're talking Rubik's Cubes
again so none of those are gonna be a present in the population that you took
that's the founder effect so you could have an heirloom or a land race that
started from a from founder effect because like I said you only went in and
grabbed a population of seeds from a very small area and they did not
represent the whole gene pool they only represented the gene type that you went
in actually grabbed a hold of and it didn't contain none of those odd-shaped
ones and that's why we're not that's why you can't breed ABC out of my angel line
right it's not in there and that's why ABC doesn't have the ability to breed my
angel because it's been bred to a recessive homozygous trait with that
leaf structure and it's terpene profile so you have to breed it to another plant
that is not related to an f1 and it should not be related to it in any way
and now you're gonna get seeds out of there that are not going to express that
mutation because it's recessive but some of them carry it because they're
heterozygous for those traits so some of them like we're gonna call big and small
the leaf so some of them are big B small B some are big B big B and some are
small B small B the small B small B is ABC the big B big B is the plant that we
crossed it to that it's not related to will call blue dream right and the
crosses in between that look like blue dream that carry that recessive trait
or the heterozygous ones that in the next generation will start to show some
of those but they're not going to be homozygous they'll just going to continue
to show heterozygous recessive traits you're going to find some of the
homozygous that show you the tall tree and now you're going to get extras of
that homozygous recessive trait that came out of the ABC on structures of
plant that will look similar to the blue dream that you started with so
you'll be able to morph that blue dream into that structure or look for the ABC
structure itself in the F2s and start to pair those together for F3s to now do
line breeding with filial generations or to back cross to the reoccurring ABC
parent if you want to get that leaf structure faster you back cross to the
reoccurring parent with one of the progeny from the F1s and then from the
F2s and from the F3s each time you do that you're locking in a trait from that
plant you're not locking the genotype in because they're all their own specific
genotype but you are locking in the trait that created that mutation and
forcing it to become a homozygous recessive trait in your new line which
can now be bred to other plants to show that same trait but if you use the
heterozygous plant that doesn't have both of the recessive traits you're not
getting out of there easily especially when you're using dihybrids and
polyhybrids we call them polys they call them dihybrids in there where you get a
plant that has multiple different parents with multiple traits so if you
got plant A and plant A is a cross of blue dream granddaddy purple OG Kush
right and now each one of the plants that it was crossed to was a cross of
some other stuff you start breaking that down that's how many different
genotypes are available in that population that can be expressed in the
seed stock that you make so you make an F1 from that polyhybrid and they seem to
look alike but none of them are going to breed similar to the original line which
is what a true F1 should be doing if you're doing it with true breeding line
so you take an Afghani that's true breeding and cross that to a true
breeding a walk-in or Colombian and what comes from that is a brand new F1 that
should be repeatable that should breed for the traits that it possesses but
because we're all doing this with multiple parents on our lines you get
these lines that just don't breed true in the F2s or the F3s because they're so
they're just so mingled up man it's crazy so so that's where that's where
the polyhybrid comes in a hybrid is more or less two stable lines yes two
parent lines parentals and then the polyhybrid is say so you know the new
new times the new new it's just a cluster F of genetics in there and
that's your polyhybrid yeah I call them poly walks do it's a little bit of
everything right in the mix of match so and it's just because everyone keeps
crossing everything to everything and then you end up with the stock that
doesn't breed true for anything except for from the guys that are back crossing
the specific reoccurring phenotypes and now they're going to give you some of
the traits that that plants possesses as dominant but it's not going to breed
true for the genotype it won't replicate that plant but it might replicate orange
and it might replicate purple but you're not going to get a copy of the original
parent from the seed stock because it it just wasn't bred for that you're gonna
have to take it farther by back crossing or doing some s1s there's
different forms of breeding to get you to where you need to be and it all
involves inbreeding if you want to lock in traits and genotype okay so yeah I
mean there's a there's a couple different ways that you could go about
making seeds as far as just like pollination I mean first one out
crossing out crossing is two separate parentals crossed together yep well
now Carl you take a plant and they cross it to us something it's not related to
okay that would that would be an outcrawl so if you got an Afghani and
you want to you save on got an Afghani male but you want to try to work with
that line you don't have a female so now you need to cross it to something that's
dissimilar to it so that you can find that Afghani structure and profile
easily if you cross it to another related Afghani you're gonna have issues
with trying to find the traits that that plant breeds homozygous for because they
both might carry some of those traits and now you're seeing it but they're
heterozygous because they're not on the same section of the DNA chain so they're
not gonna actually breed homozygous for that trait so what happens is that you
take that Afghani and cross it to a Colombian that's an outcross and it's an
f1 but you're gonna take that and back cross it to the original Afghani line
now it doesn't have to be the specific parent you want to cross it to the
original Afghani line for the outcrossed and then back cross it into it makes a
hybrid vigor into the line but it also gives you the ability to start to
recognize the homozygous traits that plant offers I usually do it with two
separate females not related to it so if you say the wide leaf starts to show up
in both plants I know that the male that I used is passing wide leaf as a
dominant trait if it starts to pass a shorter structure and all of the crosses
I know now that the tall is not dominant the short is a dominant trait in this
plant so I can pass that over I can start breaking down a Punnett square
that shows the different alleles that are going to pop out of this plant and
the frequency at which they will pop out and whether or not I'm going to get a
homozygous or heterozygous plant from the pairing and that that was a total
gold nugget there for anybody who didn't catch it again because a lot of us don't
have access to particle splitters and the science labs an excellent way to see
what your male is doing or not doing is to breed it to a couple different
females run that progeny and just like he said if you start to see a particular
trait from that male carry to both of these females you might know what it's
gonna do or pass on to you in the future so I think that that's kind of did I
kind of paraphrase that right there for you mr. toad or that's important yep I
just went to the comments I'm sorry brother I was trying to read the
comments I'm on my phone and I have to cover you up so hey that's okay
terminal I'm terminally flashcards no we got to do is start sharing the
information we learned today with our friends every time they say indica and
sativa don't be a dick just tell a man check out what I learned right yes
because we we do want to be educated we are the cannabis we are not domes
donors trust that there's no way you're building soil out there and learning the
enzymes that are creating the THC in your plant there's no way you're going
to be able to guesstimate what's going to happen from across without some form
of education it doesn't have to be book smarts but experience alone is an
education right and you're going to be able to master your failures through
repeating them enough to finally go I'm not gonna do that wrong right and our
terminology is a great great example of that there's just way too many of us out
there that are repeating shit that we heard from somebody else that heard some
shit from wasn't sure where they heard it from right so and then it comes down
to the fact that like a cat like me that's passing a little bit of
information a very small amount can give you links to the information so that you
can find out that I'm not making it up and it's actually true it didn't come
out of a book that's trying to pass you some hype it came out of a book from
people that are specifically interested in the botanical information of a
plant right when botany is based in Latin and we're using words that we
heard in the ghetto to name some shit and tried to sound cool you sound like
me cussing and rambling but if you tell someone that you're working with a
dihybrid sativa if you want to say that I would just leave the words team out
you can start adding type 1 type 2 type 3 like I said there's five types there's
different types of cannabis out there and if you can learn that the next thing
you know your your knowledge base jumps tremendously because you're not going
to settle with just learning for new words you want to learn 16 new words
then you're gonna go to learn more and more and more until eventually you're
dead from learning right you're gonna die and all you did was spend your time
learning it says sitting on your ass like a log that's there's no reason for
it amen dude that is exactly what we're trying to do today so amen to that I just
think that folks out here need to um like take more more time to educate
themselves instead of spending as much time looking like a fool spas passing
the old bullshit that we all know Indica literally means over from India and I'd
like people to like in the comments right now how many people are literally
are growing a plant that came from India not one that has some India genetics in
it like you know but one that's 100% India Indica from India how many I know
one guy out there that does that on the regular and he's he post that shit all
the time my buddy Phil was always growing some India shit right it's real
thin leaf tall lanky ass plant that goes with fucking days it's not a wide leaf
plant the there are wide leaf plants from India but that doesn't mean that
they're from India so we tell our friends that well you know we've got an
Indica we'd literally don't know what we're talking about when we say that
right just tell him you're growing this polyhybrid that you bought from your
homies because all cannabis is great there's no bad cannabis I've never found
one yet all I found is bad people trying to push cannabis on me right and that
the bad dude usually the guy that doesn't know anything he's talking about
he tries to tell everybody they're wrong about what they're saying and he never
takes time to learn anything new he's just telling you what he heard and what
he's seen and what he thinks you should be looking at and that you don't want to
fuck with a dude like that when it comes to your the medicine that you're putting
in your body man when it's there to keep you alive or to keep you from dying or
to just make your dying a little bit easier you don't need that bullshit
right yeah amen to that and man there's so so many directions I should go but
that's inspirational and I hope everybody else in the chat is picking up
on that too you know a couple of things that you've already kind of touched on
and that we could just go maybe a little bit more into things that are gonna help
these people plan their breeding practices or their goals because again
you have to have a goal well you don't have to but it's best when you have a
goal and you're trying to do something and we were just talking about you know
you just mentioned the Punnett Square Punnett Square is something good to
understand it doesn't apply all the time when you get a whole bunch of
traits in there but it's something it's that foundational foundational practice
of dominant and recessive traits that you need to understand so when you do
see these two plants cross and like he was saying it passes on the wide leaves
you could kind of be like oh okay well maybe that was two capital letters or
two lowercase letters either way yeah you know so so what it what is kind of
the Punnett Square and how is that helpful or what can it be used for
reading well with can't with what like I said with the polyhybrids it's really
not even something we can use but if we were working with true breeding lines
it's something that's used to show you the Leo frequency in a line of the
dominant recessive traits so we start off here with the large letters are
always dominant traits doesn't matter what this trait stands for it could be
blue it could be tall it could be green whatever the hell it doesn't matter but
the large letter is dominant and the small letter is the recessive version of
that allele so when a plant receives both dominant homozygous alleles from
that specific trait it is now a homozygous trait it's going to be able
to pass it when it breeds now in this cross you'd line them all up with the
parents and what's available from the parents and that's what gives you what's
a possible cross from that pairing you can't get something that's not there
it's going to show you what's going to show up the most it's going to show you
what's going to show up as heterozygous the heterozygous is would be like right
here with the large a and a small a and a large being a small B when that breeds
it could pass any one of the A's and any one of the B's which means it does not
breed true to the genotype that we're after right here right you cannot get
this genotype from this one because it does not breed true for it but then you
come down here and you've got recessive ones like this this is homozygous
recessive right where to go right here well it's got two copies of the small
two A's and two B's so this means that plant no matter what's going to always
give you the recessive gene combination and that's where you take a plant like
the the ABC or freak show and you start passing that recessive gene but because
it's recessive in the f1 that's always going to be dominated by the larger
allele but it's always available in there because you've added it to that
gene pool now so now when you go to that gene pool to start pulling out new
plants to breed with now you have available that recessive gene so all you
have to do is continue to breed until one of the plants shows both of the
recessive genes through breeding because when it has both it's going to look that
way so if you if the genotypes dark green but the recessive phenotype or
genotype in there is yellow you're always going to see yellow and yellow
can never breed dark green so you can always going to get yellow from that but
dark green can breed dark green or yellow because you found yellow in there
so that the yellow is that very bottom one right that's the homozygous
recessive that's your mutation that's your outlier it's not coming out of ten
seeds right it's going to come out of ten thousand seeds right that's what
people have to understand these very small batches that we're going through
give us beautiful plants to smoke and grow they do not replicate the genotype
that these plants originally came from be it skunk be it my space cush line
whatever it is when you start to breed through with a smaller population you
are removing genetic combinations and your Rubik's Cube now goes from the one
that does this to the one that's only got six sides right so you don't get
this hundred sided Rubik's Cube no more so you don't have the ability to breed
any of the traits that are missing anymore because you have narrowed it
down and now all you're able to get out of there are some of these which is
nothing wrong with them but they do not represent the original genotype that you
were looking for not the expression it just has part of the gene pool that was
available which doesn't breed true because the gene pool was wide and it
was just Rubik's Cube right so it's only going to breed for Rubik's Cube that's
all Rubik's Cube cared about was replicating Rubik's Cube and making sure
we don't die we don't care if there's some morphidites in our Rubik's Cube we
don't care if there's black and white Rubik's Cubes we don't care if some of
them don't even fucking spin we just want Rubik's Cubes right but if you
don't go through the selection process correctly you're going to end up with
versions of those bad ones finally that's how you get to that black and
white single one because you didn't spend enough time with enough plants to
recognize the fact that the the gene pool you were working with was far
smaller than your pipe dream right your pipe dream was at that it was it was
longer than long pipe right there brother and you're trying to pull trying
to pull something out of the the bottom of a barrel that's just not in the
barrel yeah well speaking of long pipes big
shout out to Peter in the background everything work yeah making putting all
the words up and bringing up the graphics and I do want to say everybody
that is listening to us today please do give mr. toad a follow on Instagram like
he said he posts up these papers it is there for all of us to read and it's a
frickin fascinating one so if you're not already following them follow them get
some of this information and dive a little bit deeper and do the research
yourself one thing I always say everybody any scientific paper that you
read I mean obviously consider the source who paid for it all of that jazz
but go to the bottom because there's references and you'll be able to dive
deeper into the subject and it's that is a true rabbit hole when you start
going into the references so take advantage of that portion of it some of
these people out there like with reversals there's like Mohan Ram has
written so many different papers on reversals with cannabis like you can go
in there and double-check his paperwork more people have went through and
replicated that work you know that what he's telling you is a fact and you don't
have to dig around and look with your feelings to see if maybe he got it wrong
right maybe he did but don't be passing your information to people until you
know you've got it right like that especially with cannabis and breeding
this medicine man where's my page I was gonna say I got my recipe yeah I'm glad
that you're moving on to that because I got a lot of questions for the show but
number one topic out of everything was reversing and I think that's great
because I am fairly ignorant on it and I've seen a lot of what you've posted
you've got you've got that personal experience so please I'll ask you some
questions but take it away as far as that goes because I'm all ears here
okay the first thing I'll tell everyone anyone that's interested in reversals
look up Mohan Ram and Josuel there will be the people that I know of that we're
doing cannabis reversals specifically with silver and cobalt and ga3 back into
the 70s and maybe even earlier I can't remember the exact date on them Mohan
Ram and and just wall you easy to look up now what they were doing was trying
to figure out if they could reverse cannabis males and females right so with
the male they're using a product or a chemical that's called ethylene it's a
plant hormone ethylene helps regulate the expression of pistol it formation or
stamina formation in cannabis so if your plant it starts to produce a little
higher amount of ethylene and the ratio starts to increase it's going to show
pistol it formation if your plant has a higher levels of ga3 at a specific time
period if it's endogenous hormone levels are higher it usually expresses as a
male now these can be swayed from inputs in the soil from temperature from
chopping on your plant all these things can affect the chemical makeup that
plant that can cause the endogenous hormones to sway doesn't mean that that
plant will stay in that specific hormone level it's like a plant that's
revegging it shows that it goes from one specific set of hormone levels to
another by revegging right the abscessic acid levels changes the ga3 levels
change the oxen levels change the amount of ethylene in the system changes and
the plant becomes easier to grow into a vegetative state because those hormones
change their plant growth regulators produced by the plant plant growth
regulators now we can take the same hormone ethylene and use it on a male
plant this now becomes a plant growth retardant it it halts the way ga3 is
processed through the male plant it increases the amount of ethylene to ga3
levels in the plant endogenous hormone sways and now that male will start to
produce pistol it formation which now if pollinated onto itself like you take
a male that's not treated and let it pollinate the one that you just treated
that male has the ability now to give you regular seed stock so there's one
way to reverse with males a second way is to use either silver cobalt or ga3 to
use it to block copper and ethylene production in a female so copper helps
regulate how ethylene is processed in the receptors of a female plant when is
going through a bud formation if you halt the way that ethylene passes it
does not have the ability to grow pistol flowers so now it starts to form
stamina flowers now when you reverse a female there's a lot of trouble with it
actually dropping the pollen and the problem we have with there is a female
plant cannot grow a filament there's a small little stock that comes up with
cannabis plant that connects to the stamina flower that's called a filament
that's not on there you have the problem with that flower actually falling over
and opening up and opening the sepals and allowing that pollen out so with
cannabis if you want to reverse a female you're gonna start off with a man I'm
trying to find it just wrote it down silver nitrate
a gram of silver nitrate or you're going to keep it in a dark cupboard as
long as it's cool like it doesn't have to be ultra cold where did I just write
this down it's gonna tell me that I can't find it on that's fine and a lot
of people out here to are probably going to be reversing the female most cases
that I see people have found like you know they're they're fire and they're
like I've got to have this I got to reverse it and we'll get into how it's
actually expressed or represented in the project we'll get to that in a minute
but yeah that's a lot of times I'm surprised I've never done it that way
I've always used males so yeah that's that's an interesting one so yeah but
the female you're using a silver thio sulfate a lot of people want to try to
use collodial silver because they think it's easier to use it but it's very
inefficient on reversing your female because of the size of the silver
particle you're trying to get that silver ion to replace copper in the
system of the plant and it's just sitting on there that's why it burns the
shit out of your plant when you lose collodial silver you're using silver
thio sulfate now you've got it in a very it's a smaller size particle and it's
easier to pass through the epidural layer of the plant so that's why you can
now spray nodes instead of spraying the whole plant and get a more efficient
reversal my on my youtube channel I have the recipe on there there's three
videos on there that show people and walk them through the process of how to
make the silver thio sulfate at a nine to one ratio some people will find a
four to one ratio there's some three to one ratios for cucumbers out there but
for me with cannabis I use a nine to one ratio which is the 500 milliliters of
water to half a gram of silver nitrate and then 500 milliliters to two and a
half grams of what is the other chemical I can't remember off the top of my head
silver the thio sulfate that's two and a half grams and then you're gonna mix
part B up and once B's mixed together you mix up part A and then once those
are together you take 50 CC's of part B and start to mix it and while it's moving
you slowly add 50 CC's of a very slowly let them combine completely and once
those are combined do you now add that to 900 milliliters of distilled water
and you have your final product that can be used to spray on plants but if you
keep them separated in a and B they will last much longer you can those separate
jars in your refrigerator once they're in the refrigerator they're good for
about six months or so I've even had them go up to a year but they'd lose
their efficiency on the plant it's very cheap to make it so like it's gonna cost
you like $40 in material to make enough STS to reverse half the planet I mean
this stuff is dirt cheap you're for real it is dirt cheap and I've done collodial
silver I've shown people how to do that in videos but it's some plants will not
reverse with the collodial silver like my space cush Fino number two I could
not get that plant to reverse for me with collodial silver I had to go to an
STS so it's just more efficient and there's different companies you can get
it from out there if you don't want to make it like riot seeds has one the guy
that I tell everybody about is the dude who I got the recipe from online it
would be hypertech and he got his stuff from what I understand through reading
Mohan Raman sets work so he just figured out doing the math in there if you go
through you could do this they math so and hyper deck has a company that sells
versions of this so you can just buy the chemicals and mix it with a specific
amount of water and it will reverse your plant with one spray instead of the
stuff that we're doing now like my recipe you're gonna have to spread a few
times to get it to take hold on your plant yeah recipe actually does one
spray and will reverse your plan okay yeah that was my next question is like
is it usually a one-and-done is it something you have to spray for like
weeks at a time and where do you spray are you spraying like right at the node
are you spreading on the leaf like a foliar or I sprayed node I do nodal
treatment because the nodes were the highest concentration of the ethylene
that we're trying to alter is that so I do very specific node spring with it I
start 10 days before flower and spray the plant one time okay and then on the
day before I go to flip it I spray it one more time and then I again I spray
it every five days until it shows male formation the stamina flowers once it
shows that male formation even just one I stop and allow that plant to do what
it's going to do you don't want to continue to spray because moisture is
going to kill your pollen by kill it's going to deform it right to pollen has a
specific shape it has three different little indentions on it if those are
destroyed in any way or shape it cannot form a pollen tube and there's no there's
no seed getting form you just stay in there pollinating with a bunch of dust
yikes yeah that's that's not the point of doing it and and does it have to be a
certain height are you spraying the top of the plant that gets most of the light
or you spraying nodes at the bottom that get less light or does it matter well
what I was reading this I'm sorry brother yeah no worries go ahead and get
that from Cascadian grown here I also if you can reverse a male to make a female
pollinate it with said male that's exactly what I was talking about but
it's a it's a inbred s1 version of the genotype that that male contained but
now it comes in regular seed form is because a male contains a why it can
pass it in his breeding when you reverse a female it only contains an X so it
cannot pass that why so even if you think you've seen a male out of there 99%
of the time what is happening and just having issues with its endogenous hormone
levels which means it has not acclimated to the environment you're in something
in that environment you no matter how locked down it is has told this plant
that you need to do this weird shit right it's not because the breeder did
some it's the environment causing those alleles to turn on and off and now those
have the ability to cause different mutations to form in the plant right
that can they can turn on and off this is just something that happens with
cannabis it's part of its evolutionary process that kind of leads into I got
two questions the first one real quick is when you're spraying that does it
make a difference or do you prefer to spray the upper nodes which get more
light or do you spray the lower ones that get less light or does that I
sprayed the whole if I'm reversing a plant I there's one specific plant in
the room that's being treated I treat the whole plant okay the other plants in
the room are untreated and allowed to be pollinated so that male will be removed
when it's being treated I spray the nodes till they're dripping down you
don't have to spray the whole plant because that um it's a maybe out of
stress you're doing to the plant the smallest amount that you can add to that
environment the better so with a male if it decides to throw pistols out there's
no trouble what's gonna happen is it's either gonna get shriveled up from the
moisture and die back or it's gonna get pollinated in your form of seed so when
you reverse in males you don't really have to worry that that thing
homophrodite it because it threw a pistol right it threw a stigma actually
so you have a brand new stigma that popped out that doesn't affect the rest
of the garden it just affects that single spot on the plant with a female
if something happens now like in a natural room if that plant does not like
what's happening say you reversed one female and the female next to it starts
to homophrodite you're going to have to remove that plant or you're gonna have
issues with knowing which seed was created by which pollen grain okay and
and that was you know and this might be I don't know if it's too broad of a
question but this is something that I see come up a lot of times and I just
thought come up and chat again but it's like what is the difference of a like
feminized seed from 15 years ago that had a lot of like hermaphroditic traits
in the offspring versus a feminized seed of today where things are very very
reliable you know like almost like a few and 10,000 will actually have that trait
it's kind of the same technique right or is there what's what's the difference
or is it just depends on the source like the older stuff a self an actual self
seed comes from nature causing an abiotic stress on a plant that now made
a stigma that is pollinate aria stamina flower that is pollinated right
naturally those usually in my experience were usually killer plants now if you
get a plant that in a room made massive amount of stamina nodes in there which
is the stamina flower that's popping out everywhere in there and then you start
getting regular stamina flowers I start to pollinate in my experience those
plants are going to breed higher amount of homo for diets but today what we've
learned is how to create that on purpose so if you're selecting a very stable
female and reverse her she's going to offer you up alleles that don't have
issues with environmental impact until you start to back cross repeatedly on
herself and cause a bottlenecking of all the bad alleles which are recessive so
the only way those recessive alleles can recombine is by introducing them back to
their selves and the only way you do that is through constantly back breeding
or breeding to the bad genotype that's coming out of the seed stock so like 10
out of a thousand are showing this jacked up growth their auto flowering
they're minotious they're male and female but because you don't care you
pollinate it and collect the seeds and add that back to your seed stock and keep
pollinating you're increasing those allele frequencies by adding back that bad allele
to the breeding program so before no one was really breeding that was the problem
cats were growing for commercial and they weren't taking the time to find out
if the seed stock they were making was good or bad and if they did they didn't
care they just either worked with it tossed it out and started again or you
know I gave them to someone and then someone else started fucking with them
and didn't realize what they had and starts repeating the process over and
over and over just because they got some seeds in the early days of cannabis
people were afraid to buy anything they didn't talk about shit so when you did
get something you you just fucked with right there with what you had like you
couldn't go ask your neighbor what to do with them you there was no online forum
to find out that I needed to weed out the bad expressions that you just thought
I need to make more seed so you just keep making more seed and didn't worry
that like half the population was creating these stamina flowers from
stress in the room and you repeated this so what happens is those now become those
homozygous recessive traits that are going to start to pop out in your line
and end up showing up in the heterozygous male and females from it
and now when you go to breed those out you're they've increased that bad allele
it starts showing up in your regular seed stock and I've had that too like I
you know in the very beginning I started out with a lot of bag seed as a lot of
people do and from that I've definitely pulled some winners but there's a few
that I can remember that you no matter what you did it was gonna throw some
bananas and it was going to give you some seeds god dang that's a big joint
but uh yeah it's bag seeds I'm all for playing with it but you got to be
careful with it but again keep an eye on it there's there's those different holy
crap the different factors that pull it off so go big or go home with that joint
shit that's the dog Walker this is cherry pie and space cheese right now
this is the parents to the gun Joji I've got a mix of them going today that's
awesome that's awesome let's uh let's see here was so shine saying indicators
to see these stage I see that um it's gonna depend on the line that I'm
looking at so and what I'm trying to breed out of that line I can use my
space kush line as an example I can do an early sex on them without having to
actually see the the sex that the flower formation of male or female I
don't have to see stamina or pistol of formation on those plan because I've
worked with them so long I can tell an early stage of the node shape whether
or not that plants gonna be a male or female so in early stages of seedling
once I get to like the fourth node I could start calling all the males out if
I was only looking for females in that line there's also like in the Hawaiian
duck web right it's an inbred line something in there you'd look for is
whether or not it's showing that web formation if it doesn't show it you have
a highly recessive trait in a line that's already recessive so that now you
could either take that plant and start breeding line breeding in a whole new
direction from that genotype or just call it because you were looking for the
web formation so there's gonna be a complete different reasons why someone
would start calling seeds in a seed line it could be anthocyanin connection I'm
always gonna get it wrong but I believe it's called choline there's a anthocyanin
that's produced in very young plants that turns the stems and the petials red
to help protect against high amount of light so it's on my Instagram I believe
I put it on there so like if you ever go look at your plants and you say it's got
red petioles right you know the stem that's connecting the leaf to the stem
if you really pay close attention and take a scope to it you'll notice the
bottom are usually green even though the tops red and this is from a
formation of that anthocyanin being added to the top epidural layer of the
plant to help protect it from too much UV or specific frequency of light that
you have above it it may be too strong it may be because there's too much
photochrome red coming through or far red because of how much leaf is covering
shit the bottom layers of foliage so now you're starting to get more red on the
area so you'll notice usually that red is forming on the newer growth on the
new leaf sets coming out it's just showing you how anthocyanins can be
produced in a plant besides the calyxes and the dark leaves when they're fading
that can be used like if you know that's a precursor to your plant producing a
certain anthocyanin later in flower now you could either call that or keep that
plant in rotation at an extremely early stage before it's even made its second
or third set of leaves because it's already producing higher amount
let's see I think I lost you guys. You're good you're back. Oh wow did you guys hear any of that?
yeah yeah you're so excited and talking so fast that your bandwidth couldn't
keep up with you I might have to go outside and get more bandwidth out there
show you guys my garden out there even yeah yeah it was all good we're just
talking about you know culling and kind of at what point I usually because again
I have a small garden I'll kind of let things go sometimes if it has you know
desirable traits as far as like spacing and node lengths one thing that does
make me kind of want to cull things is when it gets too far behind everything
else that it starts to get its own watering schedule its own feeding
schedule it's like once you put me behind like that it's just I don't you
know I don't want to deal with it but I'm about to start doing that with yeah
perfect timing I've got a bunch of mud bones out here let me show you guys
there's one that's not doing the same as the rest let me try to find it I got to
switch you guys around here hold on yep yep playing the phone game and it says
it's a nice day here too so we got some Hawaiian duck foot here I've got some
Chelsea's from a limerize and Nick the homie Nick I've got some Pam F2s back
here that I got in from trees I've got the Cody G this is a line that's named
after my buddy's son passed away I'm gonna be doing some work with that line
named after a son so we can give away a whole bunch of seeds then we got some
mud bones right here where'd the hill they're over there on the other one my
mud bones are what I'm going through and looking for and I'm going to show you
one that's doing exactly what you said it's over here on this other one so this
one right here is completely different than the rest of them it's just showing
it does not want to be out here it doesn't accept the water the rest of
them do the rest of them are growing just fine so in the early stages this
is the first one I'm going to be taking out period I just transplanted it on
accident I would have already killed it but this thing here does not want to
process like the rest of the plants in this garden at all so it's it's showing
that it it can't handle the water stress it can't handle the heat here so chances
are it's probably gonna have pest pressure also if it's always doing that
so if I want to take that and start to breed with it it's probably the worst
selection out of what I'm working with right now I started with 50 and I'm down
to about 20 of them to what I'm going to work with where's the mud bone male
let's see where do I have that mud bone I just ripped all the leaves off it but
this is the male that I'm starting with I'm looking for a male and a couple
females out of here so I can work on a f2 version of the mud bone that I'm going
to be calling the comedian I've been wanting to do this line for years I
almost died and didn't wasn't able to start it I had started selection in 2016
and then shit went sideways on me so I started it back up again and what I got
out here I've got all my mom's out here trying to reset them some of the smaller
clones were put out in some three gallon pots I'm letting the Sun tell this plant
which traits it needs to turn on and off for the environment that I've read in so
I've read in an area that's extremely hot we're gonna be a hundred and eight
next week we've been up to 120 and I want my plants to be able to deal with
that so the best way to do that is every year to get those plants put them outside
and let nature tell them what to do so that's awesome man that's a stress test
right there so right here we have my breeding tent I've got two cherry pie
two star dogs and a Bruce banner number three in here and I'm using a
supplemental light in here so that the plants all grow with a good canopy I
that Bruce banner I knew was gonna jump like that so that's why it's in the back
corner but everything else in here topped one time I've got two males and
pots that's what's here these two males are two space cheese males that are
gonna pollinate I usually put my males in a separate room to start their flower
cycle so it initiates quicker and then I bring them out here on the specific date
so that I start having bud formation to be able to pollinate large enough buds
to get a large enough seed stock so I'm not just making 10 or 20 seeds I'm
trying to make as many as possible in here so I got this in a 3x3 raised bed
yeah get the joint out my mouth underneath we got some logs down here
there's a bunch of worms in there I do a like every five days I do a small top
feed of some organic oats I use nutritional yeast I add some kashi in
there I use barley and I'll add some small amount of oh no he dropped out
I was reclined and relaxing yeah pop back up real quick yep probably is in
three two and he's back sorry about that guys I'm switching I'm switching the
camera back the other way here we go so you can see my pretty face there we go
so yeah and then now we're out here in this heat so this heat out here is
telling these plants that they need to be able to live without a lot of moisture
they need to build up enough trichomes to fight off the increased amount of UV
light that's out here because the Sun is the best source of UV light I'm not
getting that out of no LED lights man I know they say they got them they do not
produce anything near what the Sun does or the spectrum right I've got I've got
a UV B bar on the way from a company so it'll be interesting to try that and
just see to see if it makes a difference see if I notice anything I find the
majority of times in my A and B tests it's like maybe it did maybe it didn't I
believe you will my friend I've got a couple homies that switched over to some
of them if you use them correctly you're gonna see an increase in trichome
completely you should start seeing a little bit of color showing in plants
that that are hiding in there and then their allele structure like I said with
the choline that happens I got a stem here and see if you guys can see that
that purpling in the stem right there yep I see a perfect that's an anthocyanin
that's there to help protect that tissue from the amount of light that's hitting
it on here so that plant it seems to have it now the farther down I'm gonna
pull a leaf from lower down lower down the plant it's not as it's not as red
right because the plant does not receive as much light lower than it does above
because light loses its intensity the farther you go down the plant and that's
a really good way of looking at it too because a lot of people up until lately
have seen a pink stem or pink petioles and said that oh it's a phosphorus
problem you need phosphorus but we know phosphorus is a mobile nutrient and if
it was in demand it would bring it up from the lower to feed the upper yes if
your lower is looking good but the upper has that purple it just may be that
reaction from the light could be strain dependent but again that kind of helps
you narrow down is it really a deficiency or is it not exactly just a
lot of misdiagnosis from people because they they don't understand the process
of the plant they like you said mobile and immobile nutrients they believe that
the stems purpling it's got to be because I'm missing something in the
system and it could be you have your lights too damn close to the plant your
DL is too high the PPF is just tearing the plant apart especially if you're in
a garden that repeatedly is bleaching the tips of your plants turn your light
down and raise it you fucking the plants up like it's it's not a trait that the
plant has decided to suddenly become a breedable trait you yourself have
decided to fuck up the environment and either increased too much specific light
spectrum and like the 730 nanometers or 740 or you just basically cook the top
of that plant and it's decided I need to shut off because there's just too much
light so the photosynthesis in that area shuts the fuck down and it does not grow
anymore so you end up with this bud that's just worse than mids man we're
talking pretend Oh all damn day no pretend oh so I guess you know you had a
decent amount going out there you call them through you've already brought him
down to our lower number I know one of our you know somebody everybody likes
here cheddar Bob 13 he's in chat and hopefully he's gonna be on the show here
soon we've got to talk again but I know he is one of your testers so what do you
kind of look for from a tester what what is he doing for you and how does that
help the overall process for all of us who are gonna buy your genetics well the
first thing it does is show people that it was not grown in the environment that
it was bred in and that it can handle an outside abiotic stress 100% already
cheddar doesn't have the parents don't always got one because I actually passed
him the mom so he could grow it side by side with the seeds this allows him to
see which traits are showing up in the cross does he see something that's
coming from that parent or not right it educates that guy or that tester so they
become a better not a better grower but just better at recognizing something
that before they might have thought they saw but now they know for a fact they
see because they have the parent line with the progeny most of us out there
that are just starting and not most I'm gonna say every one of you that are just
starting to grow cannabis have not grown Kim D you haven't grown Montana
silver tip you haven't grown true granddaddy and you're buying seeds that
have those crosses in it and telling everyone that you found that phenotype
or that genotype expressing itself out of some f2c g-bot right and you've never
seen the plant you don't know what it tastes like you don't know what a breed
lights don't know what amount of veg time it took to get it to a specific
height you don't know whether or not it needs to have a different amount of
auctions when it's being cloned you don't know none of this stuff but yet
you're still saying that you found it in there you're not it's just not happening
out of those plants so we should just we got to get away from that there's too
much of that happening and then it gets the next person to a point where they
don't know what's happening and then that becomes canon for our community and
that's wrong so what I'm doing with my tester with cheddar there my homie
Cedric I sent him across and what I originally planned to do was not tell
anybody what the crosses were and then it came out in one of my live feeds so I
just said fuck it I'll tell you a lot of them don't know still but they quit they
just quit sending me information so that's what I'm gonna be looking for
some more testers here real short because some people don't take it
seriously they just take free seeds and that's all they were serious about but
cheddar on the other hand he's a guy that he's growing weed for a specific
reason right it doesn't matter what that reason is as long as he's not just
trying to grow weed if he has the reason behind it and has set up a system and
is able to replicate it this is a person that I'd like for testing right he knows
his environment he knows his soil system he knows how to water his plants so the
chances of him deciding to go in there one night and just put 45 gallons on
him because he's drunk it's not gonna happen right so the abiotic stress that
could come out of Cedric's room is going to be natural stress if it happens it
happens if it doesn't it doesn't I'm not looking for people that are trying
to make my lines turn homophodite because I can do that with any plant
that I want I can go in there every night in the middle of flower and
eventually it's going to show homophodites I can put too much nitrogen
on that thing up to week six of flower and guess what you're gonna have
homophodites right I can spray silver in your room and you don't even know it and
your whole fucking room turns looking like they're males and right it's
abiotic stress I'm not after whether or not you can make that plant turn to a
homophodite I want to know if the native stresses in your environment
outside of mine cause that to happen so that's one reason why I would put them
in outside testers hand another one like I said was to help educate that grower
on how to recognize traits in a plant that before they weren't able to see
because they've never grown that plant so if I give them the mother stock to my
plant I never pass my males I just don't do that because the male has the secrets
in it that's what they don't know it's got a large mega base of genetic coating
so my Rubik's cubes are bigger and more plentiful when I'm messing with my male
the female is only giving me certain specific versions of the Rubik's cube
that's what people don't know but I give him that female he grows that female
right he knows what terpenes come off that female now the mom that was in the
cross he knows how tall it stretches and at what specific time it stretches he
knows when it finishes he knows when it clones and how fast it sets root now he
grows the seeds next to it and all of a sudden half the seeds don't root quickly
they grow shortly the terpene profile is completely different than the mom
you're starting to see traits that came from the parent line that was the male
that you don't have access to now what you can do is start to work with that
side to learn it or you can take what you know from the parent that I passed
you and take some of the offspring that are close to it and back cross to the
reoccurring parent now that Bruce Banner that I sent him can be now back crossed
and now I've jump-started your breeding program because you have the mom and
you have its progeny and you have the ability to back cross to a specific
genotype Bruce Banner number three and add your own spin to it by selecting
through the seed stock that you yourself create and that's part of what like I
don't care what people do with my seeds when they're breeding as long as they
don't make f2s and claim they're the breeder of their strain if you're gonna
use my stuff to make f2s you should have had enough you know pride in your and
respect to say I got him from boneyard that's all you got to say or I got him
from you know whatever breeder it is because you really didn't do anything
make gonna have to besides buy ten seeds and let one male pollinate one female
most likely and that they took no selection it didn't take any type of
work or drive to take it to anywhere you weren't housing plans for like I said
earlier when we first started I had the bubble for 16 years like if you're not
how it's you what are you doing like you're just getting high on your own
supply and that's cool but don't front and pretend like you know everything
about a plant when like you're living in a tiny little apartment with a 2x2 tent
and you can't you can't do nothing with that that's on a large scale if if you
want to be truthful about stuff so just grow what you love and work on that but
don't front like you did ten years of work man yeah it's it's amazing that the
longer you do this the more you can pick things out you know there's our John or
Franco actually from you know like the strain hunters video he runs into the
field and he instantly recognizes the puto Roja but dude really a lot of
plants look similar when you're starting and then the more you grow and the longer
you do it those nuances come out so if you're trying to pass something off as
something to an older generation grower or smoker you're gonna get called out
pretty quickly and it's funny some well it's not funny but sometimes there's a
lot of ego attached to the plant and that's not universal I think you're an
excellent example of it you know you you give praise to the plant you kind of
guide it but you know it's gonna do what it's gonna do yeah sometimes people will
attach the the F twoers will attach the ego to it and say they they bred it but
again it doesn't need to be that way and it's not fully that way but yeah don't
don't fake the fun guys cuz let's just be real we can all be friends do you
guys see this is well let me make that a little bigger I'm just catching up on
so actually but before all right so read that since you were talking about
hermaphroditism yeah we were talking there was a kind of a conversation in
chat about you know what really is a hermaphrodite if it's the one that
throws a little nanner at the end but doesn't pollinate anything or if it's
a picture on my page about that they're called stamina nodes there we go that's
the name of it it's actually called a stamina node it's on my Instagram page
if Peter wants to pull it up I can't pull shit up here is it a recent yeah
it's probably the like within the last 10 posts it should be a picture of some
buds that have a hermaphrodite sticking out of them I'm pretty sure it said
stamina node on the on the actual post and I was reading that one recently
because again that is more of if I'm correct is that on the fill you'll feel
or the other account fill you'll feel I only use fill you'll feel the other ones
are all backup accounts just in case
then they are genetic they are not the apiatic stresses he's correct with that
um they're a genetic coding and the plan to try to repopulate I'm looking I'm
looking it's not moving for me keep going
else's it should be above that yeah yeah meiosis was on the left-hand side I
believe if you keep going up yeah it's a pirate there we go
reverse reading novel breeding approach based on engineering meiosis trying to
see the Sun is killing me out here did you see that Peter it was two down from
the DDA on the left the reverse breeding this one is that what you were
talking about I'm trying to see I've got says stamina node man I wish I could
yeah I'll go out and tell you I'll be right back okay go back up I appreciate
that but again this is kind of everybody here who is breaking family news Gemma's
very first tooth came out at her mom's about 20 minutes ago in case everyone
was wondering did it fall out or did it get a wiggle she definitely could not
stop touching it so she definitely probably wiggled that out play with your
tongue yeah if I remember oh the days the days and I was queuing up a let me
see if I can god damn it yeah you know there's inflation going through the roof
Peter so tooth fairy better do you better Barry get alone and I had a hold
on I was real quick in chat because yes I've done this and I'm sure some of you
have to who has tied the dental floss to their tooth and a doorknob and shut the
door well that's what Gemma asked me if I was gonna do to her you should have
said yes I think it was it was like jackass three or four CMYK one of those
movies but they they one of the dudes had a loose tooth and so they tied like
a string to the tooth and the other end to BAM's Ferrari they just took off down
the track and his head just goes yeah the good old days all right a couple
people in chat I've done it big ups you guys way to live I see mr. toad hold on
one second I just reposted it brother it's the first post on there okay but
before we go there cheddar Bob it must have been a while ago in the comments
