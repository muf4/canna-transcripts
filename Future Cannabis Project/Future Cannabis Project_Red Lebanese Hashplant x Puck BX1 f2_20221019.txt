[00:00.000 --> 00:04.640]  And all right, and we are live, Kevin, thank you for joining me.
[00:04.840 --> 00:11.560]  So the back story here is we are raising money for a good cause.
[00:11.760 --> 00:17.880]  And it's a friend who I think we both have great respect for, who we're going to get
[00:18.080 --> 00:25.360]  a wheelchair and a couple breeders so far have stepped up to donate some
[00:25.360 --> 00:28.680]  interesting stuff. You sent some stuff down.
[00:28.880 --> 00:30.600]  Bodhi sent some stuff down.
[00:30.800 --> 00:33.040]  Mean Gene sent some stuff down.
[00:33.240 --> 00:36.160]  And you guys were the only three that I've
[00:36.360 --> 00:39.160]  reached out to so far and I'll reach out to some other people.
[00:39.360 --> 00:41.200]  But you
[00:42.720 --> 00:44.280]  sent let me cue it up.
[00:44.480 --> 00:51.880]  You sent down an F2 of some some Bob Hemphill
[00:52.080 --> 00:53.720]  and Hannah
[00:53.920 --> 00:56.280]  Crickets and Cicada work.
[00:56.480 --> 00:57.680]  So you want to talk about it?
[00:57.880 --> 00:58.720]  Yeah, sure.
[00:58.920 --> 01:04.120]  So so they they do this preservation project, right, where they take that old
[01:04.320 --> 01:06.120]  Skelly hash plant.
[01:06.320 --> 01:10.560]  And I think I think Bob's got like, you know, like five years getting it into a
[01:10.760 --> 01:14.960]  stable seed form, and so I was just fascinated with the project.
[01:15.160 --> 01:17.560]  And I got nothing but respect for Bob to me.
[01:17.560 --> 01:18.800]  He's a
[01:19.000 --> 01:20.960]  solid dude and he's about his work.
[01:20.960 --> 01:21.800]  Right.
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.640]  And so when he goes and releases the lines, I go and check it all out.
[01:27.840 --> 01:31.040]  And I go through all the different populations.
[01:31.240 --> 01:35.760]  And that red lab hybrid just caught me.
[01:35.960 --> 01:38.440]  That the Lebanese influence on that part
[01:38.640 --> 01:44.360]  of brought up a different flavor, different scent and a sizzling high out.
[01:44.520 --> 01:49.480]  And so I take the seeds back to my spot and I'm telling you, I think I did it the day
[01:49.680 --> 01:56.960]  after I bought them, so I took four packs, 14, 14 seeds, a pack or 14 in every pack.
[01:57.160 --> 01:59.360]  Crack. So there was a total of
[01:59.560 --> 02:01.160]  56 plants.
[02:01.360 --> 02:04.480]  It came out to 30.
[02:04.680 --> 02:07.080]  Female and 26 male.
[02:07.280 --> 02:13.200]  And if you looked at them morphologically and tone
[02:13.440 --> 02:18.200]  probably 40 percent took after the puck or 40 percent took after the red lab and 60
[02:18.400 --> 02:24.080]  percent took after the puck and I was just opening the population up
[02:24.280 --> 02:29.760]  so that I could do a better selection and find some outliers that kind of worked for
[02:29.960 --> 02:33.920]  me on my health. And when I opened up the population and did
[02:34.120 --> 02:39.680]  that, I realized that there was this huge demand for the seeds.
[02:39.880 --> 02:41.160]  But
[02:41.800 --> 02:46.960]  Bob had only released that first release and I didn't want to release it for money.
[02:47.160 --> 02:49.080]  I wasn't trying to get in on his game.
[02:49.280 --> 02:54.720]  But I realized that a ton of people I knew wanted access to the genes.
[02:54.920 --> 02:57.640]  And there was no way to get them because it was that initial release.
[02:57.840 --> 03:03.560]  And so the open pop, the open pollination lets us capture the majority of what we see.
[03:03.760 --> 03:06.280]  And that way it'll allow people to go through.
[03:06.280 --> 03:11.480]  And I think each pack was probably like, you know, 20, 21, 22 seeds that I sent.
[03:11.680 --> 03:14.440]  So it'll give people opportunity because the regs.
[03:14.640 --> 03:21.680]  So it should give you a 10 by 10, at least 10 male, 10 female to work with.
[03:22.560 --> 03:27.520]  But that's my next level packaging, by the way, it's gorgeous.
[03:27.720 --> 03:32.000]  But it gives us it gives us the opportunity to be able to give people access to some
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.840]  of Bob's work that I just think he did a phenomenal job.
[03:37.040 --> 03:39.680]  And the red lab hybrid was stellar.
[03:39.680 --> 03:43.200]  I ran the Sensi Stars outdoor and there's some interesting ones, too.
[03:43.400 --> 03:48.560]  But that red Lebanese man had had an influence on that pup that was profound.
[03:48.760 --> 03:51.080]  And I didn't and you know me, I'm not a photographer.
[03:51.280 --> 03:52.680]  I didn't take photos.
[03:52.880 --> 03:57.200]  What I was like, but at least like with your iPhone, you know, I was like,
[03:57.400 --> 03:59.120]  do you have any pictures of it?
[03:59.280 --> 04:02.880]  I forget to take I forget to take photos of all the shit I do, like, oh,
[04:03.080 --> 04:05.840]  I should be taking a photo, I'm just not that guy.
[04:06.040 --> 04:09.720]  Right. So everything I do, I kind of mentally hold the photo.
[04:09.920 --> 04:15.160]  But the the the the breakdown between the two populations was pretty clear.
[04:15.360 --> 04:18.920]  It's like, you know, four to six, so 40, 60.
[04:19.120 --> 04:21.920]  And that way they'll be able to open it up and see what they like.
[04:22.120 --> 04:26.040]  And to me, that Skelly 88 more of a musky
[04:26.040 --> 04:32.200]  basement and that red lead has this crazy exotic like there's a floral fruit
[04:32.400 --> 04:35.800]  that weaves in, but it's got a high that's searing.
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.440]  So.
[04:37.680 --> 04:39.600]  I think that the people that access the
[04:39.800 --> 04:43.600]  stock will find some really beautiful work within it, depending on what direction
[04:43.800 --> 04:48.920]  they're seeking and by the fact that it's not being sold,
[04:48.920 --> 04:52.520]  it's not knocking off any of Bob's stuff, so it's not diminishing his work.
[04:52.520 --> 04:54.840]  And I'm not sure if he's ever going to release it again.
[04:55.000 --> 04:59.560]  I don't know if he intends to do another red lead puck release.
[04:59.760 --> 05:02.560]  Right. And I think it's sold out in like two or
[05:02.760 --> 05:04.280]  three hours. Yeah.
[05:04.480 --> 05:07.640]  So the number of people that have it in total of small.
[05:07.840 --> 05:11.240]  And I think that, you know, it's awesome that you have limited release stuff.
[05:11.440 --> 05:15.440]  But when you have stuff like that in the in the new world of micro hash
[05:15.640 --> 05:20.160]  makers and people that are looking for stuff that's outside the norm of today's
[05:20.160 --> 05:25.560]  profiles, it's crucial to be able to access this and kind of celebrate, you know,
[05:25.760 --> 05:28.200]  the the 80s.
[05:28.400 --> 05:33.240]  Have you grown each of those plants out individually?
[05:33.440 --> 05:34.840]  No, I know I didn't.
[05:35.040 --> 05:37.920]  I knew the old skelly cut.
[05:38.120 --> 05:41.160]  I used to mess around with all the old hash plants from that era.
[05:41.360 --> 05:46.800]  OK, so you had familiarity, like not just with the cross, but with like the.
[05:47.000 --> 05:53.120]  Individuals, and then I reached out to to where where Bob got the red lead from.
[05:53.320 --> 05:57.440]  So I reached out to the source of the red lead to get information on the red lead so
[05:57.640 --> 06:00.680]  I can kind of understand better, you know, what was it chosen for?
[06:00.880 --> 06:04.800]  And is that public information or is that a.
[06:05.000 --> 06:06.720]  No, I just had to go hit up the guy.
[06:06.920 --> 06:09.480]  It came from a BAM got it from Kaigu.
[06:09.680 --> 06:12.000]  So, OK, yeah, yeah.
[06:12.200 --> 06:15.160]  So it's on a coastal. And so I just hit up BAM and asked him about it.
[06:15.160 --> 06:16.800]  You know what he liked and what he didn't like.
[06:17.000 --> 06:21.840]  And what you had was you had a plant that had an absolute
[06:22.040 --> 06:28.120]  back breaking high with incredible, incredible resin potential where,
[06:28.320 --> 06:30.440]  you know, it literally rolled out the leaves.
[06:30.640 --> 06:34.480]  And the only thing that that that BAM didn't really like about the red lead in
[06:34.680 --> 06:40.120]  terms of a cultivar was it had a natural affinity for spider mites.
[06:40.320 --> 06:44.040]  But that's something that, you know, you can colonize some some
[06:44.200 --> 06:46.480]  beneficials in a sachet on the plant.
[06:46.680 --> 06:50.160]  You'd be fine. So it's I don't think it's an issue like it once was.
[06:50.160 --> 06:54.520]  Now that we know how to better work with these problems in a clean manner.
[06:54.720 --> 06:57.280]  But the influence on that hybrid was unreal.
[06:57.480 --> 06:59.200]  So he did the pure pop.
[06:59.400 --> 07:00.920]  He did it in the sense he star.
[07:01.120 --> 07:05.000]  He did it into the Napoli's hash plant, which which I provided.
[07:05.200 --> 07:10.600]  He did it into sorry, BAM did this or Bob did this.
[07:10.800 --> 07:12.800]  But I've done all these different
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.720]  hybrids using that that that BX one puck as the as the progenitor male.
[07:18.920 --> 07:20.960]  And then he went into a bunch of elite clones.
[07:21.160 --> 07:23.360]  So he used the Pacific Northwest cash plant.
[07:23.560 --> 07:27.080]  He used the Grass Valley house plant that I gave him.
[07:27.280 --> 07:29.120]  He used that red lab.
[07:29.320 --> 07:32.120]  He did sensei star.
[07:32.320 --> 07:34.920]  And I think he did like maybe one or two others.
[07:34.920 --> 07:37.080]  You know, and they were all really, really interesting.
[07:37.280 --> 07:40.280]  But that red lab got me, man.
[07:40.280 --> 07:45.000]  And when I smelled the jar, I was like, whoa, I did not expect that profile to come
[07:45.200 --> 07:49.040]  out of it. It was this combination of a sharp.
[07:49.240 --> 07:51.000]  Edge.
[07:51.200 --> 07:56.680]  Dirty basement, like the dirty basement from the skelly with this sharp edge on top
[07:56.880 --> 08:01.040]  of it that had this floral fruit that was just intoxicating.
[08:01.240 --> 08:04.840]  And when I when I rolled up a joint out of that jar, it grabbed me.
[08:05.040 --> 08:06.920]  So I was like, oh, this is the one.
[08:07.080 --> 08:10.960]  But for me, I was doing the F2, I was really opening up the population so that I
[08:11.160 --> 08:15.520]  could sift through a bigger population and find some outliers for my own purposes.
[08:15.720 --> 08:18.520]  But like I said, when when you hit me up
[08:18.720 --> 08:23.720]  for this project, I was like, wait a second, this is something that is in super
[08:23.920 --> 08:28.240]  limited supply and you're not going to get access to it anywhere else.
[08:28.240 --> 08:30.720]  I don't know if anybody else went about it as quick as I did.
[08:30.920 --> 08:34.960]  Like, I mean, I got that stuff out fast, but it was really just so I could hunt.
[08:35.160 --> 08:38.440]  And then I was I've been sharing them with some people so they would be able to
[08:38.640 --> 08:42.520]  get access to because they couldn't get access to it when it was sold.
[08:42.720 --> 08:46.080]  But I hate I hate knocking off people's work
[08:46.280 --> 08:48.600]  and them not getting any kind of benefit from it.
[08:48.800 --> 08:52.200]  So in this case, it's just really it's publicity for the work.
[08:52.400 --> 08:56.520]  And it allows there to be a really good charity situation to occur.
[08:56.720 --> 09:02.000]  And it doesn't conflict with with Bob being the one who really put this out and
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.160]  did all the work and should get all the credit.
[09:04.360 --> 09:06.200]  That's awesome.
[09:08.040 --> 09:13.880]  So in terms so for you is just purely a fun project, like in addition to all the
[09:14.080 --> 09:19.360]  whatever you're working on work wise, it was just like for shits and giggles.
[09:19.560 --> 09:20.680]  Yeah, this is for me.
[09:20.880 --> 09:23.080]  This isn't this isn't this wasn't for a company.
[09:23.280 --> 09:25.000]  This wasn't for a client.
[09:25.200 --> 09:27.360]  You know, those are those are different gigs.
[09:27.560 --> 09:31.440]  And I would I would use Bob's work in a
[09:31.440 --> 09:35.320]  project because it's got quality, but I got to go a couple of steps away from it
[09:35.520 --> 09:38.960]  or otherwise I'm basically just stealing his effort.
[09:39.160 --> 09:44.160]  And that's never the point, you know, and so this particular one was I did it
[09:44.360 --> 09:47.240]  because I wanted a bigger population to hunt through.
[09:47.440 --> 09:51.800]  And I just realized that if I made a couple of thousand seeds, I'd have it.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.480]  And then you hit me up and I just said, hey, wait a second.
[09:54.480 --> 09:56.080]  I got something that's really cool that I
[09:56.080 --> 10:00.080]  think would be in demand for the public, which is what's important for charity.
[10:00.280 --> 10:03.480]  You can put up interesting things.
[10:03.680 --> 10:08.560]  But if it's not like desirable for purchase, it doesn't do enough.
[10:08.760 --> 10:12.960]  We're in this case, you know, the work that he put up, it sold out so fast that I
[10:12.960 --> 10:16.400]  was like, whoa, they could have released a whole nother batch and it would have went.
[10:16.600 --> 10:19.040]  So this way it lets people get access.
[10:19.240 --> 10:22.640]  And since it was a 56 plan open.
[10:22.840 --> 10:26.560]  You're going to get a little less bottlenecking, you know what I mean?
[10:26.760 --> 10:28.520]  So you'll have more choices within it.
[10:28.680 --> 10:30.160]  And.
[10:30.520 --> 10:34.120]  I was just really impressed with the distribution, so the pucks were nice, too.
[10:34.320 --> 10:37.000]  I mean, the puck by itself is a sweaty,
[10:37.200 --> 10:43.200]  musky, thick, old school hash plant that we didn't know what to do with an 88.
[10:43.400 --> 10:46.000]  We didn't really we know how to make water hash back then.
[10:46.200 --> 10:48.480]  And so you couldn't really it's funny
[10:48.480 --> 10:52.480]  because you couldn't really appreciate a lot of those old plants because we didn't
[10:52.680 --> 10:57.160]  really process correctly and now that we have the technology, we don't have the plant.
[10:57.160 --> 11:01.600]  So Bob re-releasing it and getting into a seed form so people can get access
[11:01.800 --> 11:05.800]  and then doing the hybrid so that you get some differentiation.
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.120]  And then people like me, you know, that are that are putting together the F2s on some
[11:11.320 --> 11:15.320]  of this stuff for bigger sifts, it just lets us get it out into the public
[11:15.520 --> 11:19.400]  so that people can enjoy some of this work and celebrate, you know,
[11:19.600 --> 11:24.160]  the the rarity of a red lead cross with the rarity of a skelly.
[11:24.360 --> 11:26.520]  Are you going to exploit like are you
[11:26.720 --> 11:29.920]  running anything over the winter or are you kind of done for the year?
[11:30.120 --> 11:31.560]  No, I'm already I already went in.
[11:31.760 --> 11:36.680]  I actually out of that 56 plant, I chose three males that were stellar
[11:36.880 --> 11:41.920]  and I already started laying those into other elites to play around with pro.
[11:42.120 --> 11:45.880]  So I've already done that work and now I just got to go do the hunt.
[11:46.080 --> 11:51.600]  I just did a bunch of hunting through this outdoor season on a bunch of different
[11:51.600 --> 11:55.280]  lines. I was seeking some for hash, some for flower.
[11:55.480 --> 11:58.040]  What what what did you hit with it?
[11:58.240 --> 11:59.880]  Are you allowed to say that? Yeah.
[12:00.080 --> 12:04.720]  Yeah, no, I took I took this I took the the red those three red lead males and I
[12:04.920 --> 12:10.800]  went into a lemon tree because I think that that lemon profile will line up well
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.160]  with the profile of the skelly and the puck so it'll all blend in.
[12:15.360 --> 12:19.360]  And then the lemon tree gives you a little bit more solidity in the body.
[12:19.520 --> 12:24.880]  I mean, in the morphological characteristics and it was just something I thought would
[12:25.080 --> 12:28.880]  go well together, and so I still have those three males that I retained
[12:29.080 --> 12:31.680]  and I'll figure out what I want to lay into next.
[12:31.680 --> 12:35.680]  But I think what I'll do is I'll just go do an indoor sift this winter on that.
[12:35.880 --> 12:39.160]  The three red lead males into
[12:39.360 --> 12:42.640]  red lead pups, the X males into that lemon tree.
[12:42.840 --> 12:43.920]  And that's the same thing.
[12:43.920 --> 12:45.360]  But that's that's not to do a breeding
[12:45.360 --> 12:50.400]  project as much as this to pull out an outlier cultivar for floral production.
[12:50.600 --> 12:53.920]  Got it. And the.
[12:54.120 --> 12:56.680]  Like people keep sending me kind of land
[12:56.880 --> 13:02.520]  racy stuff from all over, and I know you did a what was the last kind of open
[13:02.720 --> 13:07.560]  pollination you did? Oh, I did on that the Ghazni from Afghanistan.
[13:07.760 --> 13:11.680]  Yeah. Oh, the the full power guys sent me a whole
[13:11.680 --> 13:15.320]  collection of Afghani stock and they just sent me a collection of stock out of
[13:15.520 --> 13:17.680]  Pakistan, India.
[13:17.880 --> 13:22.760]  And what I do is I open pollinate the work and then I share it with people so
[13:22.960 --> 13:27.520]  that what we have is we have a preservation held by many
[13:27.720 --> 13:33.280]  and people can take it and then hybridize using the males so that we have
[13:33.480 --> 13:37.440]  the ability to weave new flavors and different types of high
[13:37.640 --> 13:40.080]  and then put it on modern cultivars.
[13:40.080 --> 13:45.760]  So I took like a Ghazni male that was nasty and I laid it on a cherry pie.
[13:45.960 --> 13:47.960]  And it gave me some rosen that was just
[13:48.160 --> 13:51.720]  making people like fall down, like I mean, brutally powerful.
[13:51.920 --> 13:54.000]  And it got a whole bunch of L.A.
[13:54.200 --> 13:58.240]  guys kind of excited about different direction because they had never smelled
[13:58.240 --> 14:01.160]  those types of profiles because they hadn't been messing around with,
[14:01.360 --> 14:06.240]  you know, indigenous Afghani and the high was encompassing.
[14:06.400 --> 14:10.800]  So what it does, it allows us to create like a better globalization of cannabis
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.600]  in an appreciative sense where you start to realize that all these countries
[14:15.800 --> 14:18.840]  of origin, their quality of product is phenomenal.
[14:19.040 --> 14:23.280]  It's just not necessarily visually what we in America
[14:23.480 --> 14:26.240]  because we've been conditioned to seek visual products.
[14:26.440 --> 14:27.640]  The shiny red apple.
[14:27.840 --> 14:30.680]  Yep. And what you want to do is you want to be
[14:30.880 --> 14:35.320]  able to help them understand why these things are important and preservation so
[14:35.400 --> 14:40.000]  that you have a bank to go into and then hybridization so you can mine
[14:40.200 --> 14:44.800]  characteristics. And for me, I was trying to really grab two things primarily,
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.320]  which was.
[14:46.520 --> 14:48.480]  The ability to create a better hash,
[14:48.680 --> 14:51.680]  because it's all that the Ghazni lines, all hash extract,
[14:51.880 --> 14:56.840]  and also to create plants that had less water need so that I could find some
[14:57.040 --> 15:00.840]  plants that I could run outside up the hill that didn't require the same amount
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.160]  of water so that it just kind of reduced some of my water demands
[15:05.360 --> 15:09.520]  and let me get a better hash cultivar, because it's really what I want to create
[15:09.720 --> 15:14.160]  up at my farm is is things that that go into a derivative more than as
[15:14.360 --> 15:18.240]  a straight flower, just because my hill really, really pushes that direction.
[15:18.240 --> 15:19.640]  So I might as well emphasize it.
[15:19.840 --> 15:21.800]  And now that we have the ability to do
[15:22.000 --> 15:26.200]  fresh frozen and good crafts and we can put them into pens,
[15:26.400 --> 15:30.040]  you start to have the ability to have easily consumed tools.
[15:30.040 --> 15:33.920]  But at a level that's so far above distal, it's they're not they're not even
[15:34.120 --> 15:36.240]  in the same sentence. Yeah, I know.
[15:36.440 --> 15:43.680]  Like Alex Hardy in Utah has been doing a like a dry farming project with Belia.
[15:43.880 --> 15:45.240]  Yeah.
[15:45.440 --> 15:48.920]  Which is very Hardy, I guess, would be the word.
[15:49.120 --> 15:50.760]  No, no. Hardy's got to ship together, man.
[15:50.960 --> 15:56.960]  His his work is I always love what he does because he's he's he's doing the real
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.000]  where it's these seeds have to exist on their own because it's very hard to go
[16:01.200 --> 16:03.360]  tend them on the side of a mountain.
[16:03.560 --> 16:06.080]  So he's producing stuff that's resistant
[16:06.280 --> 16:14.120]  in in a climate that's rough with low fertility and shorter seasons.
[16:14.320 --> 16:17.920]  And so Alex's developmental work is to me, it's what I call real,
[16:18.120 --> 16:22.320]  you know, real school work, it's stuff that you can depend on to utilize.
[16:22.520 --> 16:25.720]  And it's in profiles that aren't in the norm because everything we've done is
[16:25.720 --> 16:29.840]  homogenized and so as impressive as a lot of this shit is,
[16:30.040 --> 16:31.720]  it all smokes the same to me.
[16:31.920 --> 16:34.600]  I get the same basic high.
[16:34.800 --> 16:37.280]  And that's the problem is I'm kind of bored.
[16:37.480 --> 16:41.040]  I mean, I like Italian food, but if I eat it 30 days in a row,
[16:41.240 --> 16:43.480]  it's something different. Right.
[16:43.680 --> 16:48.560]  Now, I like the the the top is kind of like a little bit of everything.
[16:48.760 --> 16:50.160]  But
[16:50.600 --> 16:53.080]  what was I just going to ask you?
[16:54.080 --> 17:00.040]  Yeah, I like for me, as people send this type of like kind of the land race,
[17:00.240 --> 17:03.720]  you stuff into me, I've kind of thought about.
[17:04.400 --> 17:06.640]  It's almost like a library where like I'm
[17:06.840 --> 17:12.520]  trying to to just do seed production runs and trying to get other people to help out
[17:12.720 --> 17:17.560]  like I'll send people seeds to be like, just run this out and send me back the seeds.
[17:17.760 --> 17:22.080]  And then I try to get that stuff out to other people as kind of building blocks.
[17:22.080 --> 17:27.120]  So whether it's land racy stuff or stuff that's even just high in,
[17:27.320 --> 17:30.720]  you know, like I have some stuff that's really high in CBG.
[17:30.920 --> 17:34.080]  And it's it's for me, it's just a tool in people's toolkit.
[17:34.280 --> 17:36.440]  You may never use it, but it's kind of good.
[17:36.640 --> 17:39.520]  Like you'll use the hammer a lot more
[17:39.520 --> 17:41.960]  frequently than you'll use a lot of other tools.
[17:42.160 --> 17:45.120]  But it's good to sometimes have those tools in your toolkit.
[17:45.320 --> 17:49.520]  And that's kind of where I view my like
[17:49.560 --> 17:55.960]  when people buy seeds, I try to send out like try this and this and this and this.
[17:56.160 --> 18:04.280]  And they're all kind of whether it's like Thailand, racy or CBG or whatever,
[18:04.680 --> 18:11.920]  just trying to get the base tools and more people's toolkits so they can kind of.
[18:12.120 --> 18:14.520]  Be more diverse in what they're playing around with.
[18:14.720 --> 18:16.800]  Oh, totally. It's exposure to you know,
[18:16.800 --> 18:20.640]  you got to remember that you got a lot of the new cats in cannabis are young.
[18:20.840 --> 18:24.120]  Right. Which is which isn't which isn't a knock on them.
[18:24.120 --> 18:25.000]  It's just they're young.
[18:25.200 --> 18:27.520]  And so the problem is they've only been
[18:27.720 --> 18:32.120]  consuming herb that they've been able to get from in the country.
[18:32.320 --> 18:36.520]  And so what happens is you start to think
[18:36.720 --> 18:39.640]  that that's the population of cannabis in general.
[18:39.840 --> 18:46.000]  And what you want from a lot of this stuff is it expands your view of what's possible.
[18:46.200 --> 18:49.880]  It takes you down different directions in terms of scent, different directions
[18:50.080 --> 18:54.960]  in those different directions in morphology, radical directions and high.
[18:55.160 --> 18:59.240]  So that you're able to kind of start to steer better what you want,
[18:59.440 --> 19:01.640]  because like you said, it's tools, it's the same thing to me.
[19:01.840 --> 19:03.480]  It's I call it options.
[19:03.680 --> 19:06.600]  You want to be able to have as many options as possible so that you're able
[19:06.800 --> 19:13.160]  to really steer and move to either fit commercial sales or personal use.
[19:13.360 --> 19:17.600]  And the ability to get the stock out and hunt is big because what we want is we
[19:17.800 --> 19:22.160]  want to meet the recognition that there's there's craft cultivators.
[19:22.360 --> 19:26.520]  Preservationists around the world and that what you want is you want to have
[19:26.720 --> 19:32.640]  the Pakistanis, the Afghanis, the Moroccans, the Lebanese, the Indians,
[19:32.840 --> 19:36.680]  the people that are in the Americas, people are in Southeast Asia.
[19:36.880 --> 19:40.880]  We all should be communicating because we're all exactly in the same situation.
[19:40.880 --> 19:43.080]  We're all people that love to grow weed.
[19:43.280 --> 19:45.200]  And when you're able to start having
[19:45.400 --> 19:49.880]  these conversations, you're able to really start to steer your projects and process
[19:50.080 --> 19:52.920]  better and at the same time it brings attention.
[19:53.120 --> 19:55.240]  So me giving out all the gods we work
[19:55.440 --> 20:00.400]  brings attention to the applicability of using genes from these areas.
[20:00.600 --> 20:05.520]  But with the warning of here's the seeds I'm giving you, open pollinate them,
[20:05.720 --> 20:10.600]  create your base population, put that away from that, select some males that
[20:10.600 --> 20:15.800]  you're really attracted to, lay those into some of your your modern cultivars,
[20:16.000 --> 20:18.880]  do your trial run and see what the impact is.
[20:19.080 --> 20:20.280]  And what you're going to find is some
[20:20.480 --> 20:24.680]  fascinating stuff because the the cherry pie out of the selection.
[20:24.880 --> 20:27.160]  I had a single cherry pie.
[20:27.360 --> 20:29.800]  Gosney, that was crippling.
[20:30.000 --> 20:31.680]  I mean, absolutely.
[20:31.880 --> 20:33.480]  Something you crossed yourself.
[20:33.680 --> 20:35.280]  Yeah, yeah, I did.
[20:35.480 --> 20:36.520]  And did the SIF.
[20:36.720 --> 20:38.960]  And so I ran it into a bunch of stuff
[20:38.960 --> 20:42.440]  and like it was funny, but like all the stuff through the through the OG's was
[20:42.640 --> 20:47.160]  like this really mellow, mild, pleasant, chill high.
[20:47.360 --> 20:49.000]  And you'd think that it would have went
[20:49.200 --> 20:51.840]  the other route because it was an Afghani on top of a gas.
[20:52.040 --> 20:54.680]  But that Afghani on top of that cherry pie
[20:54.680 --> 20:57.200]  created a product that when I smoked it, it scared me.
[20:57.400 --> 20:59.360]  I went out to the garage, I got lost.
[20:59.360 --> 21:00.680]  I didn't know what I was in there for.
[21:00.880 --> 21:04.360]  I went back to the house and then I started questioning,
[21:04.560 --> 21:06.480]  do I have the ability? I was fixing a hot water heater.
[21:06.480 --> 21:08.720]  And all of a sudden I was like, do I have the ability to even do it?
[21:08.720 --> 21:11.360]  I mean, I started questioning, could I could I fucking turn around?
[21:11.560 --> 21:13.920]  Could I complete a task today?
[21:14.120 --> 21:16.640]  And I was at the limit of what was possible.
[21:16.640 --> 21:19.640]  Right. And I was like, holy shit, this is real.
[21:19.840 --> 21:23.520]  So when I took it to that meeting where all of us breeders and nursery operators
[21:23.720 --> 21:27.800]  were all together and I was nuking these poor L.A. guys out.
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.080]  They were like, whoa.
[21:29.280 --> 21:32.600]  And then they asked, hey, can I get access to the stock?
[21:32.600 --> 21:33.800]  And I was like, totally.
[21:34.000 --> 21:35.480]  All you got to do, though, is just make
[21:35.480 --> 21:39.000]  sure you talk about it, that it's you know, you didn't invent it,
[21:39.200 --> 21:43.040]  that you got it from a farmer in Afghanistan via me.
[21:43.240 --> 21:47.960]  So it's it's it's one step removed, but it's still pure.
[21:48.160 --> 21:49.640]  And what we're doing is we're bringing
[21:49.840 --> 21:55.040]  attention to regions so that what we have is this cultivator start to realize that
[21:55.240 --> 21:58.640]  you're not just in your community, you're in a global community.
[21:58.840 --> 22:02.840]  And to me, it's that's the best part of cannabis is that you have it.
[22:03.040 --> 22:04.040]  Yeah, it's interesting.
[22:04.040 --> 22:08.640]  There's like the balance of, you know, I know a lot of Americans who are now
[22:08.840 --> 22:14.160]  in Thailand and moving to Thailand and they're bringing like the ties.
[22:14.360 --> 22:18.000]  The demand there is for the hype American stuff.
[22:18.200 --> 22:21.800]  Right. And it's kind of like how the American.
[22:22.000 --> 22:23.000]  So what's that?
[22:23.200 --> 22:24.840]  The American goes to Thailand.
[22:25.040 --> 22:27.200]  He doesn't want to buy Tyrants.
[22:27.400 --> 22:29.160]  Right. He wants to stick.
[22:29.360 --> 22:31.480]  He wants he wants leafy ass open
[22:31.480 --> 22:35.560]  structured herb that you got to tie to a stick or it looks like a bag of trash
[22:35.760 --> 22:42.880]  because the high is so savage that you'll you'll you'll look past the visual.
[22:43.080 --> 22:46.360]  So, yeah, you just have to be able to separate the pools.
[22:46.560 --> 22:49.960]  It's kind of like with the Morocco project I'm involved in.
[22:50.160 --> 22:52.080]  The problem is that when they brought all
[22:52.280 --> 22:56.800]  the Dutch in the US jeans in to try to, like, you know, modernize the industry.
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.760]  The problem is all these plants that are
[22:58.760 --> 23:01.720]  being brought in are coming primarily from indoor.
[23:01.920 --> 23:06.040]  And that means that they're getting optimal environment.
[23:06.240 --> 23:07.960]  So there's no question you get enough.
[23:08.160 --> 23:10.040]  Why don't you how much you're drying it back?
[23:10.240 --> 23:13.440]  You have to wet it first to dry it back.
[23:13.640 --> 23:18.440]  So with with stuff in Morocco, Pakistan, Afghanistan, with the climate change,
[23:18.640 --> 23:20.160]  there's no wetting it down.
[23:20.360 --> 23:23.960]  You have minimal water from the from the beginning all the way to end.
[23:24.160 --> 23:26.400]  And so it's trying to go in sequence and
[23:26.400 --> 23:31.800]  remove the Dutch and American genes out of the gene pool so that we can focus on
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.960]  plants that are from native populations that have the resistance to actually
[23:37.160 --> 23:42.040]  function in that environment and then from there select the quality.
[23:42.240 --> 23:45.520]  But when you're just trying to say, hey, look, this is a better plant with no
[23:45.520 --> 23:47.400]  context of how to cultivate it.
[23:47.400 --> 23:49.880]  And then you got agronomists telling the people in the desert, hey,
[23:49.880 --> 23:51.560]  you need more water and drip irrigation.
[23:51.560 --> 23:53.280]  And they're like, well, we don't have any water.
[23:53.440 --> 23:57.080]  And where the hell are we supposed to get the drip irrigation from?
[23:57.280 --> 24:00.240]  It isn't like we have a store around the corner.
[24:00.440 --> 24:06.280]  And so so much of the native work is is is they're limited by their constraints,
[24:06.480 --> 24:11.480]  but because of it, they rely on the plant to do the work where we rely more
[24:11.680 --> 24:15.240]  on the infrastructure to do the work than the plant.
[24:15.440 --> 24:18.400]  And you are able to take anything and put
[24:18.400 --> 24:20.480]  it into a modern system and make it work.
[24:20.680 --> 24:23.400]  But you can't do that in harsh environments.
[24:23.400 --> 24:24.800]  Put something take something that's from
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  the 30 and put it in in Colombia and tell me how it went,
[24:28.200 --> 24:32.320]  because it's going to either trigger when it's a half an inch taller, it's going to rot.
[24:32.520 --> 24:38.720]  So it's this it's this reality of things work in certain circumstances and people
[24:38.920 --> 24:43.200]  may love what they want, but in Thailand, the best thing that could
[24:43.200 --> 24:48.440]  happen is that we're exporting to Thailand and Thailand is exporting to us
[24:48.640 --> 24:52.800]  because otherwise, but, you know, they're creating they're creating an American base
[24:53.000 --> 24:57.400]  because that's where the hype is, but you're you're you're going to do the same
[24:57.600 --> 25:01.720]  thing, they're going to they're going to truncate that Thai population and start
[25:01.920 --> 25:06.560]  to remove what's left to fit in the American population.
[25:06.760 --> 25:08.640]  And that's the that's the crime.
[25:08.840 --> 25:11.080]  Yeah, no. And that's where I was going.
[25:11.080 --> 25:12.680]  That's why I brought it up, because it's
[25:12.880 --> 25:19.200]  almost like we need to make sure we preserve, like identify and and preserve
[25:19.400 --> 25:25.640]  kind of all those microclimate genetics all throughout Thailand and Cambodia and
[25:25.840 --> 25:30.560]  the region around there before kind of all the hybridization comes in.
[25:30.760 --> 25:32.920]  I just feel like that's naturally going to happen.
[25:32.920 --> 25:36.640]  Like people are going to like 10 years from now be like, oops, we did it again.
[25:36.840 --> 25:39.240]  The problem is that no one wants to pay.
[25:39.400 --> 25:42.040]  Like I looked into cryogenic preservation
[25:42.040 --> 25:45.600]  because cryo is probably the best way to go about it, because if you're doing it
[25:45.800 --> 25:49.120]  in vitro, you've got to restore the charge every 45 days.
[25:49.120 --> 25:52.080]  Right. So you can't just leave it in the cell.
[25:52.280 --> 25:54.080]  It has to be serviced.
[25:54.280 --> 25:58.160]  But cryogenically, it's frozen.
[25:58.360 --> 26:00.480]  And as long as you can maintain that that
[26:00.680 --> 26:05.600]  condition through a minor electrical charge and some gas to top off so your
[26:05.800 --> 26:09.200]  liquid nitrogen is replenished, you're good.
[26:09.400 --> 26:13.240]  And that way the germplasm can be held in that form.
[26:13.440 --> 26:15.760]  But anything that requires in vitro
[26:15.960 --> 26:18.520]  requires infrastructure and money that's high.
[26:18.720 --> 26:21.240]  And so we were trying to figure out how to do that in Humboldt.
[26:21.440 --> 26:23.400]  How do you take all these old genes
[26:23.600 --> 26:27.920]  and how do you really preserve them in a way that's affordable?
[26:28.120 --> 26:31.200]  Otherwise, you know, you've got 10,000 things you're holding in vitro.
[26:31.400 --> 26:32.640]  Somebody's holding the lab.
[26:32.840 --> 26:34.160]  Somebody had to do the scrub.
[26:34.360 --> 26:35.880]  Somebody has to do the maintenance.
[26:35.880 --> 26:38.320]  Somebody's got a license tied up on preservation.
[26:38.320 --> 26:39.920]  Who's paying for that?
[26:40.120 --> 26:44.360]  And so the problem is that people don't realize until it's too late
[26:44.560 --> 26:48.360]  that the things that you killed are really your future.
[26:48.560 --> 26:49.800]  Yeah,
[26:50.000 --> 26:56.960]  because Thailand's not going to be known for, you know, runs exports, right?
[26:57.160 --> 27:01.480]  On a global market, I understand the locals want to try stuff they've never tried
[27:01.680 --> 27:06.200]  before and that'll be Glasshouse, that'll be Glasshouse with five square foot.
[27:06.200 --> 27:09.800]  They'll run five million square foot of mix light and they'll be spitting runs out
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.800]  over the planet, but for Afghanistan, Pakistan, India,
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.400]  Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Morocco, Lebanon, Colombia, Brazil,
[27:21.600 --> 27:26.520]  you know, all these countries that have had, you know, centuries of millennia,
[27:26.720 --> 27:28.800]  some of them history.
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.920]  We've we've done such a disservice to the gene pool already,
[27:33.080 --> 27:35.720]  and when the agronomists come in and try
[27:35.720 --> 27:37.880]  to help the farmers, they always do the same thing.
[27:38.080 --> 27:42.480]  The help is use my food, use my technique, use my genes,
[27:42.680 --> 27:48.800]  use our Monsanto seeds and it doesn't your South African farm.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.520]  It doesn't address the realities that the farmers face.
[27:51.520 --> 27:53.400]  And then we walk away like, all right, we got paid.
[27:53.600 --> 27:54.720]  We said we succeeded.
[27:54.920 --> 27:58.720]  But the problem is you've caused irreparable damage to the stability
[27:58.720 --> 28:02.200]  of the village and they rely on that crop.
[28:02.400 --> 28:03.840]  They don't have another crop.
[28:04.040 --> 28:09.080]  And the money made from that is it doesn't people don't catch like
[28:09.280 --> 28:13.760]  in in like Pakistan, Afghanistan, the money from farming is really
[28:13.960 --> 28:15.520]  because they're farming other things.
[28:15.720 --> 28:16.880]  So it isn't about food.
[28:17.080 --> 28:19.600]  It's the money to send their kids to school.
[28:19.800 --> 28:22.160]  It's the money used to try to get their
[28:22.360 --> 28:25.120]  children into a situation that allows them a better life.
[28:25.120 --> 28:30.720]  And so when you screw them there, you screw up generational stuff.
[28:30.720 --> 28:34.040]  It's not like, oh, you struggled this year because of the mistake.
[28:34.240 --> 28:36.840]  It's like, no, no, you change the direction.
[28:37.040 --> 28:39.000]  Of of our future,
[28:39.200 --> 28:44.480]  and so trying to be able to make the awareness is big and and I just got lucky
[28:44.480 --> 28:47.840]  that I tied in with a lot of these groups and they they just said, hey, well,
[28:48.040 --> 28:52.000]  we'll provide you with genes because we know you give all this shit away.
[28:52.200 --> 28:53.960]  And and I was laughing and I was like,
[28:53.960 --> 28:57.560]  oh, cool, because I was like, you know, I want to see people be able to have
[28:57.760 --> 29:03.640]  the ability to bank and and breed so that you have cultivators all over
[29:03.840 --> 29:09.520]  the world being able to share genes and hybridize and get a feeling of like,
[29:09.720 --> 29:12.920]  man, I want to go to India now that I ran Indian genes.
[29:13.120 --> 29:14.240]  I really like the effect.
[29:14.440 --> 29:16.480]  Like the Pakistani stuff is so good.
[29:16.680 --> 29:19.840]  I'm fascinated. And, you know, that's that's what we need is we need.
[29:20.040 --> 29:22.480]  We know we the Indian weed is amazing.
[29:22.480 --> 29:25.800]  What else could be interesting about this?
[29:26.000 --> 29:30.440]  It opens up all these doors that, you know, the the weed opens up for us,
[29:30.640 --> 29:34.040]  but it allows us to really
[29:34.240 --> 29:36.320]  this thing called the CTAR.
[29:36.520 --> 29:42.800]  Yeah, it's a lot of the the connect is as as cultural groups as well, too,
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.200]  because the American cultivators, the Canadian, the Central and South American,
[29:48.400 --> 29:52.040]  we're all the same different different conditions around us.
[29:52.040 --> 29:57.000]  But if you love growing weed, you know, not much difference between us.
[29:57.200 --> 29:59.640]  Yeah. Have you
[30:02.260 --> 30:06.740]  as I'm looking at kind of like things that are trending, I feel like kind of a lot
[30:06.940 --> 30:10.460]  of people are exploring the sour diesel again.
[30:10.660 --> 30:13.140]  Yeah, they go back to the sour.
[30:13.340 --> 30:18.260]  And what do you have, any sours kind of coming across your radar?
[30:18.460 --> 30:20.500]  Like like I got
[30:20.700 --> 30:26.620]  someone sent me like the Alder Point sour diesel, the Top Dog sour diesel of the AP
[30:26.820 --> 30:30.060]  sour silicate, sour, sacred, sour.
[30:30.260 --> 30:32.460]  What's that? The sacred sour.
[30:32.660 --> 30:33.780]  That was like that.
[30:33.980 --> 30:37.540]  That was the nickname of that one, I think, coming out of AP.
[30:37.740 --> 30:39.780]  But I got a couple of sour stashed.
[30:39.980 --> 30:44.460]  The issue with sour is that it finishes too late for us outdoor here to really get
[30:44.660 --> 30:46.220]  a completion.
[30:46.740 --> 30:48.860]  And it's the same thing with indoor like so
[30:48.860 --> 30:52.380]  for personal use, you know, if you're going to greenhouse, you can run it.
[30:52.420 --> 30:53.900]  And if you're doing it indoor, you can.
[30:54.100 --> 30:56.340]  But you've got to take it almost 80 days.
[30:56.540 --> 31:00.740]  And it requires you to really back the light up and drop the temp and stuff so
[31:00.940 --> 31:04.780]  you don't unravel it or it kind of opens in its finish.
[31:04.980 --> 31:09.940]  So, you know, you'll see sour hybrids, but you're not going to see it in any giant
[31:10.140 --> 31:12.580]  level just because it's too long flowering.
[31:12.780 --> 31:16.620]  So, you know, most commercial facilities are sixty three, sixty five.
[31:16.820 --> 31:19.540]  They had a window where they say anything after that, we're done.
[31:19.740 --> 31:25.860]  And for sours, seventy seven, eighty is really the sweet spot.
[31:26.060 --> 31:31.460]  Yeah, and then kind of they're talking about on the East Coast, the PIF.
[31:31.660 --> 31:34.700]  Yeah, yeah, they do, they love the PIF and that's like a Cuban black.
[31:34.900 --> 31:38.940]  I'm messing around with a nasty I got to kill him until I went to a population and
[31:39.140 --> 31:45.420]  pulled out a winner, it's a C5 haze to Vietnamese.
[31:45.580 --> 31:51.300]  They call it like the how Bach is like the vomit, you know, and it is just nasty.
[31:51.500 --> 31:55.340]  I mean, encrusted and has this super exotic.
[31:55.540 --> 31:58.980]  Those two with it's not haze, it's the
[31:59.180 --> 32:03.140]  Vietnamese wove through and created some other directions.
[32:03.340 --> 32:05.100]  So, you know, shit like that is hell of a
[32:05.100 --> 32:08.300]  trap, but it's the same thing, it's stuff that you grow for yourself so you can
[32:08.500 --> 32:10.900]  share with your friends and enjoy in your own.
[32:11.100 --> 32:13.420]  But you won't see these in any commercial
[32:13.420 --> 32:17.020]  application because the yield per square foot isn't big enough.
[32:17.220 --> 32:19.220]  Yeah, no, I
[32:20.180 --> 32:21.420]  it's interesting.
[32:21.620 --> 32:24.380]  I mean, you know, as well as anyone that I
[32:24.580 --> 32:26.980]  mean, especially like the California commercial market.
[32:27.180 --> 32:32.020]  Like I know so many people who would like to be growing kind of the long flowering
[32:32.220 --> 32:36.260]  hazes and stuff like that, but like the California market doesn't value.
[32:36.260 --> 32:40.540]  They're not like, oh, my God, that took you longer to grow and it yielded less and
[32:40.540 --> 32:43.900]  it looks ugly and the THC numbers are not high.
[32:44.100 --> 32:47.700]  Like we'd like to pay more for that
[32:47.900 --> 32:50.860]  because we know it costs you more to make it.
[32:51.060 --> 32:53.780]  Let us value your work appropriately.
[32:53.900 --> 32:55.740]  Yeah, no, you're not going to get any of it.
[32:55.740 --> 32:57.380]  And the truth of it is, too, is that what
[32:57.580 --> 33:04.060]  California wants is they want to ask, so in their mind, you know, this this.
[33:04.260 --> 33:07.700]  And by the way, do you like the old school logo I pulled out for you?
[33:07.900 --> 33:09.820]  Yeah, the old
[33:10.020 --> 33:11.940]  board number. It was great.
[33:12.140 --> 33:14.260]  They like the idea of it.
[33:14.260 --> 33:16.540]  But what they what they really seek is a hybrid.
[33:16.740 --> 33:20.220]  They want something like a super silver haze, a Jack Herrera.
[33:20.420 --> 33:25.220]  They want something that's been throttled back so that what you get is you get
[33:25.420 --> 33:30.980]  a combination of a theory and physical and reasonable finish times.
[33:31.180 --> 33:33.060]  And so that's the California world.
[33:33.260 --> 33:38.260]  It's actually the West Coast, you know, like Blue Dream still still a hot one
[33:38.260 --> 33:40.420]  in Seattle, San Francisco and Portland.
[33:40.620 --> 33:45.020]  If you got to if you got a tech area, things like that still move well.
[33:45.220 --> 33:49.060]  But if you take it to cerebral and you don't get enough body,
[33:49.260 --> 33:53.220]  it doesn't work with the group that wants it because most of the cerebral people are
[33:53.420 --> 33:57.860]  really into tech and the computers and so you're you need some body effect or
[33:58.060 --> 34:01.540]  otherwise you're uncomfortable hunched over your keyboard.
[34:01.740 --> 34:07.020]  And you need the ability to have the mind, you know, be racy, but not so racy that
[34:07.020 --> 34:09.180]  you don't get lost in what you're doing.
[34:09.380 --> 34:13.020]  And so the stuff that I like is kind of.
[34:13.220 --> 34:19.140]  In encapsulating where when it when it gets you, it gets you and it's you're in it
[34:19.340 --> 34:23.980]  till it's done and so stuff like that, you know, just isn't quite as attractive to
[34:24.180 --> 34:29.340]  the market, but I'm not I'm not sifting it for the market and I'm sifting it myself.
[34:29.540 --> 34:31.900]  So actually, just speaking of the Blue Dream
[34:31.900 --> 34:36.220]  and people who are mixing or who are about to start,
[34:36.420 --> 34:38.300]  I think everybody knows the Boaty news.
[34:38.500 --> 34:43.460]  But so for this same fundraiser, he sent down a bunch of Santa
[34:43.660 --> 34:46.980]  Santa Cruz Blue Dream 88 G13 crosses.
[34:47.180 --> 34:51.180]  Yeah, I'd love to again, as I think about,
[34:51.380 --> 34:58.220]  you know, doing seed runs and then sending that stuff out freely to people.
[34:58.380 --> 35:00.660]  A lot of people talk about the kind of
[35:00.860 --> 35:06.820]  therapeutic effects they personally get from Blue Dream, and I've just heard it
[35:07.020 --> 35:11.060]  enough times where I'm like, I want to like when because we have a medical
[35:11.260 --> 35:14.620]  program where I just send stuff out to patients and veterans.
[35:14.820 --> 35:17.980]  And it's like things I want to have to be
[35:18.180 --> 35:22.300]  able to give away at scale are things that have
[35:22.500 --> 35:23.980]  Blue Dream in them.
[35:24.180 --> 35:27.060]  And so that's kind of something I'm personally interested in.
[35:27.180 --> 35:31.260]  I just did a project using Blue Dream as a as a base.
[35:31.460 --> 35:36.140]  So I had a client ask me to create I got a client who's a grappler.
[35:36.340 --> 35:40.100]  And he says, what I want is I want something that lets me wrestle better.
[35:40.300 --> 35:45.660]  And I want to be able to feel like, you know, mentally stimulated, but not overly
[35:45.860 --> 35:50.220]  racy, I want to feel physically balanced, but not sedated.
[35:50.420 --> 35:51.380]  And so I said, all right.
[35:51.580 --> 35:54.260]  So I took Blue Dream as the base and I took
[35:54.500 --> 35:58.020]  Malawi Sensi Star as the male and and laid it in.
[35:58.020 --> 35:59.420]  And I had done the work years ago.
[35:59.620 --> 36:01.900]  So, I mean, I have a bank of work I've produced.
[36:02.100 --> 36:05.460]  And I just went back to that population and pulled it out.
[36:05.660 --> 36:09.780]  And what I ended up getting was this really interesting outlier where it gave
[36:09.980 --> 36:14.700]  me all what I wanted for the client, but it also gave me a wet mouth.
[36:14.900 --> 36:18.620]  So all my testers, all my feedback people, that was the comment on all of them.
[36:18.820 --> 36:22.700]  Like, wow, it's the total opposite of cotton mouth makes my mouth wet.
[36:22.860 --> 36:25.660]  So it was kind of cool because most people burn an herb.
[36:25.860 --> 36:30.020]  It's not the dry mouth isn't desirable.
[36:30.220 --> 36:34.980]  And I had a student come to the Gangier program that had mouth cancer
[36:35.180 --> 36:39.740]  and they have trouble with the salivatory glands aren't working correctly.
[36:39.940 --> 36:44.980]  And so I built this plant that I'm going to, you know, license and put into function.
[36:45.180 --> 36:47.980]  But I said to him, I said, listen, I said, you know, with your condition,
[36:47.980 --> 36:50.900]  this would be something that would be phenomenal for you because he's an artist.
[36:51.100 --> 36:55.140]  I said, so it'll give you the stimulation you want as an artist, but it'll also
[36:55.340 --> 36:59.620]  make your mouth intensify in terms of wet, which should which ought to help you
[36:59.820 --> 37:02.620]  since you have such a hard time salivating.
[37:02.820 --> 37:04.740]  I said, just I'm doing you a favor.
[37:04.740 --> 37:06.380]  I'm giving you the plant. Just don't release it.
[37:06.580 --> 37:09.380]  Or you'll screw me because it's I'm going to put it into the system.
[37:09.580 --> 37:12.980]  But it's stuff like that that's the core
[37:12.980 --> 37:16.500]  of cannabis, where you're doing developmental work on something for someone.
[37:16.700 --> 37:19.100]  You find an outlier that has other properties.
[37:19.260 --> 37:21.540]  And you're able to put it into play.
[37:21.740 --> 37:25.860]  And so once we get the test on and see if it works, hopefully what it does, it gives
[37:26.060 --> 37:31.940]  them the it gives them the uplifting effect that we wanted from the variety.
[37:31.940 --> 37:36.220]  And it also gives them a wet mouth, which is a problem because of his mouth cancer.
[37:36.420 --> 37:37.300]  Oh, there's big bone.
[37:37.500 --> 37:51.160]  It was a good toad on it was a bad mistoad.
[37:51.360 --> 37:53.120]  Oh, I lost you.
[37:53.320 --> 37:59.000]  Oh, sorry, I forgot I was muted, but now I was saying, like, I feel like most most
[37:59.200 --> 38:01.960]  people who pick a lot of this stuff up are home growers.
[38:02.160 --> 38:05.840]  So do you want to excite people about what Bodie sent down?
[38:06.040 --> 38:07.920]  Yeah. Which is this blue dream.
[38:08.120 --> 38:10.280]  88. Do you want to talk about the 88?
[38:10.480 --> 38:16.360]  Because 88 G 13, I see a lot of people kind of using that to to,
[38:16.560 --> 38:19.200]  you know, combine with something else.
[38:19.400 --> 38:27.080]  Yeah, because it's just it's just really a type B, heavy, narcotic, stocky plant.
[38:27.240 --> 38:32.400]  And so when you have progenitors like that, that you can utilize and bring those
[38:32.600 --> 38:35.120]  characteristics and qualities forward, it works well.
[38:35.320 --> 38:38.120]  And it's been in use for a really long time.
[38:38.320 --> 38:40.400]  So you see a lot of people using the 88
[38:40.400 --> 38:43.840]  and there's a couple of different 88 versions, meaning who did the selection.
[38:44.040 --> 38:46.440]  And I think that both use two different ones.
[38:46.640 --> 38:48.320]  And one of them was too dominant.
[38:48.520 --> 38:53.040]  And it just kind of commanded the direction of the hybrid, kind of like the
[38:53.040 --> 38:59.040]  Chemdog Special Reserve male that created that 2012
[38:59.240 --> 39:02.240]  Cup winner for aficionado that Chemdog Special.
[39:02.440 --> 39:04.280]  If you want gas, she's money.
[39:04.480 --> 39:06.560]  But if you don't want gas.
[39:06.760 --> 39:09.040]  She doesn't give you anything.
[39:09.560 --> 39:12.400]  So you can't really use that in a lot of
[39:12.600 --> 39:15.280]  projects because you end up dominating the project.
[39:15.480 --> 39:19.520]  So the 88s are dominant to some degree, but the one he's using melds pretty well.
[39:19.720 --> 39:22.400]  So to me, what you'll get is you'll get.
[39:22.640 --> 39:23.960]  That.
[39:24.320 --> 39:31.640]  Blue Dream effect, which is this good feeling of balance and energy, but
[39:31.840 --> 39:37.560]  the the the blueberry side of it brings down some of that ethereal qualities
[39:37.760 --> 39:41.160]  of that super silver, so it's not as racy and it's not a savage.
[39:41.360 --> 39:45.720]  So it's more of a like a workable, modern.
[39:45.920 --> 39:48.800]  Uplifting plan, and so when you combine
[39:49.040 --> 39:53.240]  that with that 88, what we ought to get is we ought to get a little stockier body.
[39:53.440 --> 39:55.760]  So it's a little bit easier to grow indoor.
[39:55.960 --> 39:59.480]  And Blue Dream, Blue Dream's in the mid 70s, mid, you know, kind of like to me,
[39:59.680 --> 40:04.480]  sour diesel time where you see Blue Dream short cycle, but Blue Dream outdoor like
[40:04.680 --> 40:07.960]  November 13th, just like sour mid November.
[40:08.160 --> 40:11.360]  So it's tough to really get it to do well here in Humboldt.
[40:11.560 --> 40:14.760]  Better in like Grass Valley, but indoor anywhere you want.
[40:14.960 --> 40:17.120]  So the 88 ought to bring down our flower
[40:17.160 --> 40:23.200]  in time. The 88 ought to thicken up the potential for more of a narcotic high,
[40:23.400 --> 40:25.480]  which is more in tune with men.
[40:25.680 --> 40:28.000]  So more men go with a narcotic than an
[40:28.200 --> 40:31.840]  ethereal, and I see more women go with the ethereal than narcotic.
[40:32.040 --> 40:33.760]  And so it allow you to be able to have a
[40:33.960 --> 40:37.720]  bigger population to look through, depending on who you try to satisfy.
[40:37.920 --> 40:39.520]  So I think it'd be a fun hybrid.
[40:39.720 --> 40:45.080]  And the thing with with any of these really publicized plants that all
[40:45.080 --> 40:49.000]  of a sudden now they get bad names somehow, for some reason, they sold a couple
[40:49.200 --> 40:53.800]  of billion dollars worth of herb that lets me know that somebody benefited.
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.280]  And so just because it's not you doesn't mean it's not valuable.
[40:57.480 --> 41:00.960]  And when you get that much value, you have to try to figure out who's the people
[41:01.160 --> 41:06.120]  that valued it, why did they value it and where did it go wrong in terms
[41:06.320 --> 41:08.880]  of popularity today, what made it diminish.
[41:09.080 --> 41:12.760]  And so a lot of it was to me, Blue Dream was just beating the living shit out
[41:12.760 --> 41:16.960]  of the Midwest because we were growing so much of it that we would just shell
[41:17.160 --> 41:18.760]  in Colorado and like killing them.
[41:18.960 --> 41:22.480]  And so when I started researching all the bad hype on Blue Dream, I started seeing
[41:22.480 --> 41:25.320]  that it was really popping up out of the Midwest because we were beating you to
[41:25.520 --> 41:29.240]  death with the outdoors like every year, all doing, you know, fourteen hundred
[41:29.440 --> 41:33.000]  pounds of fucking farm that you were putting into the system.
[41:33.200 --> 41:35.720]  Open ninety nine plants.
[41:35.920 --> 41:39.800]  It's kind of hard not to tear up another another state stuff.
[41:39.800 --> 41:42.120]  And so Blue Dream gets this bad rep and then
[41:42.320 --> 41:47.480]  people started growing it poorly, just like sour, sour, done early sucks.
[41:47.680 --> 41:50.320]  So you you you grow sour and you short cycle it.
[41:50.520 --> 41:52.200]  It's it's it's subpar.
[41:52.400 --> 41:53.920]  You take it out to fruition.
[41:53.920 --> 41:56.760]  It's excellent. Blue Dream, you take it out to fruition.
[41:56.960 --> 42:01.200]  It's different. It doesn't have that same powdery taste.
[42:01.400 --> 42:04.280]  It's sharper and more refined and defined.
[42:04.480 --> 42:06.760]  And I had friends that went into Blue Dream
[42:06.760 --> 42:11.720]  heavy in terms of like self in it and pulled out, you know, more
[42:11.920 --> 42:16.280]  hazy versions of it to where it was a sharper, more ethereal type high.
[42:16.480 --> 42:19.800]  And then I had friends that went into it and went into more blueberry direction.
[42:20.000 --> 42:21.800]  So it was more of a
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.240]  more sit you down
[42:24.440 --> 42:26.800]  blueberry perfume in the mouth.
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.360]  So the Santa Cruz cuts the original cut.
[42:29.560 --> 42:33.400]  And that's one thing about he's been money on it forever is he always sources
[42:33.400 --> 42:36.480]  out really good elites to lay pollen on.
[42:36.680 --> 42:38.960]  And then he only uses so many males.
[42:38.960 --> 42:40.360]  I mean, if you really look at his work,
[42:40.560 --> 42:46.040]  he's had some like like he uses a male in across a variety of plants.
[42:46.240 --> 42:49.720]  And then he kind of phases it out and he goes into another male.
[42:49.920 --> 42:53.000]  So I think that when he just did that project for cookies, I think he used
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.160]  that Appalachian male because it's that Tres dog to the green crack,
[42:56.360 --> 43:00.000]  which I think is the foundation of of that line for him.
[43:00.200 --> 43:01.960]  And so I saw that and I said, oh, nice.
[43:01.960 --> 43:04.520]  He just bringing back males and splashing it on.
[43:04.720 --> 43:06.320]  I think was like a
[43:06.520 --> 43:08.480]  I don't know, is a lemon. What do you lay that in with?
[43:08.680 --> 43:10.840]  There's a lemon tree in it, something.
[43:11.040 --> 43:15.920]  But he he's bringing older stuff and hitting it into the newer stuff so
[43:16.120 --> 43:19.840]  that what you get is you get that connection between past and present.
[43:20.040 --> 43:24.240]  And it allows you to get a bigger selection ability.
[43:24.440 --> 43:26.560]  So there's more directions possible.
[43:26.560 --> 43:28.160]  So I think the home growers and people
[43:28.160 --> 43:32.160]  that are seeking medical, you have to go through a population to find what really
[43:32.360 --> 43:35.880]  lines up with you on an endocannabinoid system level.
[43:36.080 --> 43:38.400]  So, you know, the more choices you have
[43:38.600 --> 43:41.800]  within the gene pool, the better it is for you to find efficacy.
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.440]  If you're trying to grow from seed, no.
[43:44.640 --> 43:47.520]  But if you're if you're hunting, yes.
[43:47.720 --> 43:51.840]  So, you know, that that BD to the 88 and BD really that
[43:52.040 --> 43:55.640]  to anything that people want, a good positive feeling.
[43:55.800 --> 43:58.000]  And if you can hybridize it to just shift
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.760]  the flavor a little bit, the sensei star Malawi that I use that came from Bode.
[44:01.960 --> 44:04.840]  But I did that work probably like nine years ago originally.
[44:05.040 --> 44:07.640]  But it was his gold star work.
[44:07.840 --> 44:11.880]  And I found a male in it that was just freakishly frosty.
[44:12.080 --> 44:15.040]  So when Leo Leo was hanging out at the house and he was just he tripped out,
[44:15.040 --> 44:18.720]  he was like, I'd never seen a male that had resin rails running down the leaves.
[44:18.920 --> 44:22.720]  And so I used it to make the F5 on that same line.
[44:22.880 --> 44:25.040]  And then I laid it into a ton of stuff
[44:25.040 --> 44:28.320]  that I thought would be complimentary and I just put it away in the vault.
[44:28.520 --> 44:33.280]  And when I got hit up to do that project, I re broke out the work and said,
[44:33.280 --> 44:36.040]  let me just go through some of my base work and see if I can find it,
[44:36.040 --> 44:38.920]  because that's what I created it for was those type of effects.
[44:39.120 --> 44:41.120]  It just wasn't in vogue when I did the work.
[44:41.320 --> 44:45.560]  So sometimes like you do work, but really you don't release it for a decade.
[44:45.760 --> 44:48.480]  So you do the work right now and preserve it.
[44:48.680 --> 44:52.040]  And then in 10 years, you know that the market will be back to ready for it.
[44:52.240 --> 44:56.080]  And then you can crack it out and sift out and pull the plant, push it forward.
[44:56.280 --> 44:57.880]  But you got to have a long game.
[44:58.080 --> 45:00.080]  And really, most people don't.
[45:00.280 --> 45:02.920]  They're just like cut the jaw.
[45:03.120 --> 45:05.240]  And it's just whatever's trendy,
[45:05.240 --> 45:07.880]  just pollinate it and throw it out in the public and do the thing.
[45:08.080 --> 45:12.000]  And you got to kind of be able to put together gene packages and then hold them
[45:12.200 --> 45:15.640]  until you think they're ready for you or someone else.
[45:17.000 --> 45:21.360]  Right now, I mean, again, I come back to what I like about kind
[45:21.840 --> 45:26.760]  of as I think about Blue Dream is it fell out of favor from a rec standpoint.
[45:26.960 --> 45:29.120]  But there are a lot of people with medical
[45:29.320 --> 45:34.720]  uses of cannabis who are like that shit works for me and it's my go to period.
[45:34.920 --> 45:35.600]  It just does.
[45:35.800 --> 45:39.520]  And that's the whole point is that when you start to
[45:39.720 --> 45:43.320]  what happens is you start to like we go like strange shaming
[45:43.520 --> 45:48.200]  where you find value with something and then everyone tells you you're a loser
[45:48.200 --> 45:51.520]  because you smoke it, you smoke it, meds and like
[45:51.720 --> 45:56.040]  I'm smoking it because it's giving me the impact I need on my medical shit.
[45:56.240 --> 45:58.600]  And nobody cares about your medical problems.
[45:58.800 --> 46:01.880]  Right. It's this weird Instagram world of if
[46:02.080 --> 46:04.520]  you're not valid here, you're not valid. Right.
[46:04.720 --> 46:06.920]  And the medical community is radically different.
[46:06.920 --> 46:09.360]  Everyone screams medical, but there's probably like two or three
[46:09.560 --> 46:12.280]  that actually participated in it in a genuine way.
[46:12.480 --> 46:16.320]  And once you did, it changed you forever.
[46:16.520 --> 46:21.480]  Like you can see what you saw once you once you see what happens when people don't
[46:21.680 --> 46:25.880]  have any support and once you realize how valuable cannabis is to them,
[46:26.080 --> 46:29.560]  if you don't get impacted by that shit, you're a sociopath.
[46:29.760 --> 46:30.600]  What can I say?
[46:30.800 --> 46:35.840]  You know, and so for me, medical cannabis changed my life
[46:36.040 --> 46:40.560]  because it it allowed me to see a thing that I hadn't seen, which is that struggle
[46:40.760 --> 46:43.680]  of those that use cannabis as this medicine.
[46:43.880 --> 46:45.280]  And.
[46:45.480 --> 46:47.480]  It's you have to be able to create a
[46:47.680 --> 46:51.600]  situation where there's no there's no strange shaming on that shit and you have
[46:51.800 --> 46:55.640]  to let them have access and go and so to me, if you could do work like that
[46:55.640 --> 46:58.720]  and then moving into those populations, you're doing something that's incredible
[46:58.920 --> 47:01.800]  because the medical population doesn't have the money.
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.240]  They can never afford that.
[47:03.440 --> 47:06.560]  You know, it's sending out even doing work where you have a couple of people hunt
[47:06.760 --> 47:10.280]  the population so, you know, each one of us hunts twenty five females.
[47:10.440 --> 47:12.600]  Right. So we get 50 seeds, you call them out,
[47:12.600 --> 47:16.320]  you get to twenty five, you hunt twenty five, you get four people hunting twenty
[47:16.520 --> 47:19.480]  five, you get one out of one hundred out of females.
[47:19.680 --> 47:21.320]  That's an outlier.
[47:21.520 --> 47:25.320]  That's the what that's what you really want to provide is the clonal material as
[47:25.320 --> 47:28.520]  it goes forward so that what you're saying to somebody is like, look,
[47:28.720 --> 47:35.200]  this seemed to do best in all the conditions we tested and just get to run it.
[47:35.400 --> 47:38.320]  And here's the data, because the thing I found with the med
[47:38.520 --> 47:41.160]  group is that for a lot of them, you know, they're there.
[47:41.160 --> 47:43.640]  They're struggling just to stay alive.
[47:43.840 --> 47:48.200]  So asking them to go hunt and work and do all this shit, it sounds like you're doing
[47:48.200 --> 47:50.680]  something, but really what you're doing is you're giving them an impossible
[47:50.880 --> 47:55.320]  situation and it makes them feel like they fail in there, too.
[47:55.520 --> 48:00.280]  And so, like what I learned with all the CBD work was that you just try to be
[48:00.480 --> 48:05.200]  of service and the of service is like if you need seeds, I can provide it.
[48:05.200 --> 48:07.680]  And if you need a clone, I'll give you the damn clone.
[48:07.880 --> 48:10.040]  And and we'll give it to you.
[48:10.040 --> 48:12.680]  We'll give you the information and explain everything you need to do.
[48:12.680 --> 48:15.280]  And here's my number. If you get lost, call me.
[48:15.480 --> 48:19.160]  And what it does, it allows them to be able to have the success, because I think
[48:19.360 --> 48:23.360]  that a lot of people, when they get into medical, it's this little feel good shit.
[48:23.360 --> 48:24.560]  It was like I saw a video.
[48:24.760 --> 48:27.280]  I bring this up and I saw a video of someone I know.
[48:27.280 --> 48:29.120]  And there was a homeless dude in the dumpster.
[48:29.320 --> 48:31.800]  So homie walks up to him and he films it.
[48:31.800 --> 48:33.040]  He films this guy in the dumpster.
[48:33.240 --> 48:35.840]  Then he films him giving him 60 bucks out of his own pocket.
[48:35.840 --> 48:37.600]  The phone makes sure the phone catches the money.
[48:37.600 --> 48:39.560]  Right. And then he then he gives him a lecture
[48:39.560 --> 48:41.080]  about his life choices and shit.
[48:41.160 --> 48:44.120]  And I'm looking at this and I'm like, who the fuck does that?
[48:44.320 --> 48:46.800]  You're you're you're exploiting somebody
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.760]  who's struggling to show how superior and kind you are.
[48:51.960 --> 48:55.280]  If you were kind, you wouldn't have turned the fucking phone on.
[48:55.480 --> 48:58.160]  You would have just walked over to the dude and said, yo, bro, you're digging
[48:58.160 --> 49:00.080]  through the fucking trash, you need some help.
[49:00.280 --> 49:03.440]  And you would have just helped him and you wouldn't you wouldn't put it on.
[49:03.640 --> 49:05.760]  I.G. And you would like the whole process.
[49:05.960 --> 49:08.160]  So to me with medical stuff,
[49:08.320 --> 49:14.040]  it's it's a small group, unfortunately, that really supports them,
[49:14.240 --> 49:18.920]  because if you're doing it right, you're not making them go online to fucking.
[49:19.120 --> 49:22.600]  Thank you. You're not making them have to
[49:22.800 --> 49:24.480]  thank the world for supporting them.
[49:24.480 --> 49:27.400]  You're giving them the dignity to say, listen, as a human being, it's all good.
[49:27.600 --> 49:31.120]  I got you. You don't need to validate my fucking choice.
[49:31.320 --> 49:32.960]  It's between us.
[49:33.160 --> 49:37.720]  And I just think that that it's the approach to it that has to change.
[49:37.720 --> 49:38.960]  And I think that there's a tremendous
[49:39.160 --> 49:42.120]  number of cultivators that would would love to be more positive.
[49:42.320 --> 49:45.720]  They just don't know how to make the access.
[49:45.920 --> 49:47.760]  And the people that yell the loudest
[49:47.960 --> 49:51.760]  about supporting groups, everybody's fucking skimming.
[49:51.960 --> 49:55.240]  And so the problem is real medical people are constantly getting fucked.
[49:55.440 --> 49:59.720]  And then people who are solid, who'd want to help, don't know how to do it,
[49:59.920 --> 50:04.640]  you know, and so we still grassroots it because the modern the modern world
[50:04.640 --> 50:07.960]  of medical cannabis is a fucking disaster is zero.
[50:07.960 --> 50:09.800]  The gas tax break. It's like, holy Christ,
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.640]  it's fucking billions being pulled in and you get nothing.
[50:12.840 --> 50:15.400]  So to me, it has to be grassroots.
[50:15.600 --> 50:18.400]  And so much of that struggle is to give
[50:18.600 --> 50:25.240]  people the ability to just feel supported in a way that's genuine so that you're
[50:25.440 --> 50:30.720]  you're not using it as a pitch and because if you use it, like if I needed
[50:30.720 --> 50:33.960]  to help and you fucking had to abuse me to get it, I'd take the help.
[50:33.960 --> 50:38.240]  But boy, I'd be just like you got to get beaten here, too.
[50:38.440 --> 50:41.560]  I'm not just getting my ass whipped by my ailment, but I got to get my ass whipped
[50:41.760 --> 50:44.200]  by you need and fucking public validation.
[50:44.400 --> 50:49.480]  And so I think that the approach has to change so that what we're able to do is
[50:49.680 --> 50:51.960]  is really have medical cannabis.
[50:52.160 --> 50:55.240]  And for me, you know, we didn't invent any of this shit.
[50:55.440 --> 50:58.280]  I just really looked at how Peron ran his operation.
[50:58.480 --> 51:01.240]  When I got into medical cannabis, that's what I used as my guide.
[51:01.240 --> 51:02.080]  I said, well, I got you.
[51:02.280 --> 51:05.280]  He didn't give a fuck and he just did what he could.
[51:05.480 --> 51:07.680]  And it was the best way to do it.
[51:07.880 --> 51:09.320]  And so that's how we did it.
[51:09.520 --> 51:10.840]  We didn't we didn't know what we were doing.
[51:11.040 --> 51:12.760]  We just knew that we would help you.
[51:12.960 --> 51:17.760]  And when you came in the building, we made sure that you weren't being pandered.
[51:17.760 --> 51:18.640]  You weren't being pushed.
[51:18.840 --> 51:22.720]  You weren't being put into the light as look who we're doing,
[51:22.920 --> 51:24.560]  because that's not real.
[51:24.760 --> 51:27.800]  That's that's abuse of somebody who's needy.
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.120]  And I know that I never once saw Dennis
[51:30.120 --> 51:34.000]  Peron march a fucking AIDS patient out into the public saying, look what I'm doing.
[51:34.200 --> 51:35.920]  Look at this person. See, I'm helping him.
[51:36.120 --> 51:37.360]  That shit didn't happen.
[51:37.560 --> 51:39.120]  And I need to really fucking died.
[51:39.320 --> 51:41.520]  So like it wasn't like he ever did it.
[51:41.720 --> 51:46.960]  So I'm just like we have a guideline on how to behave
[51:47.160 --> 51:52.760]  just about executing on that level and being real about it.
[51:52.960 --> 51:56.080]  You know, and everybody's everybody's immune to problems, you know,
[51:56.280 --> 52:00.040]  until it hits you directly and like for me, all the medical assistance
[52:00.240 --> 52:04.840]  that I did, I had no need for any of it until my fucking mom got cancer.
[52:05.040 --> 52:10.080]  And me being able to use the products that we were able to work with,
[52:10.080 --> 52:13.480]  me being able to get people to talk to my mom to make her feel better because moms
[52:13.680 --> 52:15.200]  never listen to their sons.
[52:15.400 --> 52:19.160]  So having having support and having access
[52:19.360 --> 52:23.840]  and having understanding allowed me to keep my mother alive.
[52:24.040 --> 52:26.960]  So I had no medical benefit whatsoever
[52:26.960 --> 52:30.160]  from doing the medical work until I needed it.
[52:30.360 --> 52:33.800]  And when I was able to execute right away
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.040]  and I was able to get people to help me help her.
[52:37.240 --> 52:40.960]  And so, you know, that's the point of it is that you climb a ladder.
[52:40.960 --> 52:42.440]  You're going to climb down the ladder.
[52:42.640 --> 52:45.280]  You might as well create good rungs up and down.
[52:45.480 --> 52:46.720]  What can I give him?
[52:46.920 --> 52:49.840]  You know, brother, you do the same thing that you're
[52:50.040 --> 52:53.440]  I've supported you as a as a as a medical person for years,
[52:53.440 --> 52:57.160]  like not support like financially, but in terms of objective,
[52:57.360 --> 53:01.120]  because you've never not been real
[53:01.320 --> 53:06.240]  and why you chose the breed, what you breed, the direction, you how you play,
[53:06.440 --> 53:10.960]  who you play with, all of those things, and it's tough because it's not popular.
[53:11.160 --> 53:15.320]  And when you go out on that shit, they have an emotional fucking breakdown
[53:15.520 --> 53:19.440]  because how dare you call me out on my bullshit?
[53:19.600 --> 53:23.880]  Yeah, but the is is that you're from real med and then you have your own medical
[53:24.080 --> 53:27.160]  struggle, so you're like, look, I I helped others and now I'm fucking
[53:27.360 --> 53:31.360]  fighting for my own life, I don't have any time to listen to anybody's bullshit.
[53:31.560 --> 53:34.120]  Yeah, I did the same thing as you, brother,
[53:34.320 --> 53:38.960]  like working through the two 15 days running a club and seeing people come
[53:39.160 --> 53:43.080]  and then never come back because they died and then like today you talk about
[53:43.080 --> 53:46.560]  the medical, there's no compassion here where they give it for free.
[53:46.720 --> 53:48.680]  We were able to make the vendors give us
[53:48.880 --> 53:52.360]  fucking certain amounts of herb to give for free for the percentages that they
[53:52.360 --> 53:56.320]  were fucking putting through our club and getting money with nobody able to bat an
[53:56.520 --> 54:01.040]  eye at it, we made sure that the really, really sick people that needed it got it
[54:01.240 --> 54:06.040]  until, like you said, it hit us each with our own mother the same way.
[54:06.240 --> 54:09.040]  And it was it's the only way to do it.
[54:09.240 --> 54:14.080]  And what it what it does, too, is it is it start it to me what it did more than
[54:14.080 --> 54:18.800]  anything was it like it allowed me to experience what it was like.
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.440]  To be real, because you're not getting any fucking benefit from this, right,
[54:23.640 --> 54:27.360]  there's no there's no benefit exchanging except human benefit.
[54:27.560 --> 54:32.000]  And you're having to to be able to take people that are fucking
[54:32.200 --> 54:35.160]  furious because they're in pain and dying and try to, like,
[54:35.360 --> 54:39.920]  gracefully escort them out the door to death.
[54:40.120 --> 54:42.520]  You're like a walking hospice.
[54:42.720 --> 54:47.120]  Yeah, it it changes you as a human being
[54:47.320 --> 54:53.440]  and it changes the families around the people because they see a level
[54:53.640 --> 54:58.000]  that they don't get in normal medicine and they can't believe it's coming from us
[54:58.200 --> 55:00.160]  because, you know, we're drug dealers.
[55:00.360 --> 55:04.400]  Yeah, that's what that's why I tell everyone, go out there, let people know you
[55:04.600 --> 55:07.000]  smoke cannabis, don't be about it all the time.
[55:07.200 --> 55:08.520]  Go do the same shit they do.
[55:08.520 --> 55:12.840]  Go do work, go be compassionate, give to your community and do it on a higher
[55:12.840 --> 55:15.720]  level than anyone thinks you can do it and do it better than them.
[55:15.920 --> 55:17.120]  And they have to accept you.
[55:17.200 --> 55:19.120]  And then they're going to want to follow the same path.
[55:19.320 --> 55:23.880]  They want to talk about the plant that made you change yourself into a better
[55:24.080 --> 55:27.440]  version of what you are today compared to what we all grew up being.
[55:27.640 --> 55:29.880]  Young jackasses and shit with this plant.
[55:30.080 --> 55:31.440]  We're all in a better place today.
[55:31.640 --> 55:35.520]  If we had the wisdom today, then the world would be a better place.
[55:35.520 --> 55:38.440]  This plant is trying to speak to us.
[55:38.640 --> 55:40.680]  Just takes too long to listen.
[55:40.880 --> 55:42.920]  Well, we're taught not to listen either.
[55:42.920 --> 55:43.960]  You know what I mean? We pray.
[55:44.160 --> 55:46.360]  We pray at the altar of money and fame.
[55:46.560 --> 55:49.600]  Yeah, but at the end of the day, you know, like
[55:49.800 --> 55:53.560]  my my daughter got ill a year ago and almost died.
[55:53.760 --> 55:58.800]  And I remember holding this fucking body at the door of the hospital because and I'm
[55:58.800 --> 56:03.320]  looking at him like, open the fucking door like I got a kid that's dying here.
[56:03.520 --> 56:05.280]  And I.
[56:05.480 --> 56:09.920]  I was like, I'd give up everything I own, everything walked out of that fucking
[56:10.120 --> 56:13.920]  hospital, and I mean, like it was so real because, you know, she was eight.
[56:14.120 --> 56:16.600]  And so you got you got you got you like older people.
[56:16.800 --> 56:19.280]  It's it's different because you say, oh, they've had a life.
[56:19.480 --> 56:20.800]  Well, fucking wow.
[56:20.800 --> 56:23.480]  And when I got ill, I didn't trip either because I'm just me.
[56:23.680 --> 56:26.520]  But boy, when it was my eight year old.
[56:26.720 --> 56:28.120]  That shit got me.
[56:28.320 --> 56:32.600]  And it's it's these polarizing moments of like.
[56:33.080 --> 56:35.800]  Life priceless, it's precious.
[56:35.840 --> 56:39.240]  You only get so much of it and you don't you're not in control.
[56:39.440 --> 56:45.560]  And the ability to be able to be part of the human experience is big and being cool
[56:45.760 --> 56:49.480]  and herb to me is what allowed me to do that or opened up those doors.
[56:49.480 --> 56:52.520]  And it let me enter people's lives that I would never met.
[56:52.720 --> 56:56.320]  And it let me be a friend to people as they passed away.
[56:56.520 --> 56:58.280]  And I I got more.
[56:58.280 --> 57:00.760]  I mean, well, obviously I'm still alive, so I got more than them.
[57:00.760 --> 57:02.960]  But I got more than them in the sense
[57:03.160 --> 57:07.080]  where they trusted me enough to be their friend till they died.
[57:07.280 --> 57:13.560]  And it's it's it's the it's the it's this human connection that we we have to form.
[57:13.760 --> 57:18.400]  And we're taught not to so that you can just come up and it's about you and it's
[57:18.600 --> 57:22.280]  yours and it's mine and you end up having no unity.
[57:22.480 --> 57:24.720]  And herb to me has always been this this
[57:24.920 --> 57:28.800]  bridge that let me connect to people that were radically different to me.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.280]  Yeah.
[57:31.760 --> 57:37.960]  Well, yeah, no, I mean, I remember when 64 passed kind of the people that I knew at
[57:38.160 --> 57:43.680]  that time who were most focused on kind of the medical side were like, we're done.
[57:43.880 --> 57:48.840]  Like our our business is not going to survive where we know this is going to go.
[57:49.040 --> 57:53.960]  And you see someone like Harry Rosette Wellness like that's his focus.
[57:54.160 --> 57:56.080]  And obviously there are people who are just
[57:56.080 --> 57:58.280]  in kind of the rec market who are struggling, too.
[57:58.280 --> 58:03.280]  But I mean, if if your focus is on medical
[58:03.480 --> 58:06.360]  and patients, you're just kind of fucked.
[58:06.560 --> 58:10.000]  Yeah, there's no there's no there's no you can't get an investor.
[58:10.200 --> 58:12.120]  I remember like when we were doing a lot
[58:12.320 --> 58:14.880]  of this stuff, I remember people coming and telling me
[58:15.080 --> 58:17.000]  about how I needed to publicize the people.
[58:17.200 --> 58:20.920]  You need to get them to do testimonials and endorse what you're doing because
[58:21.120 --> 58:25.680]  you're giving so much shit for free that I was like, you're missing the fucking
[58:25.680 --> 58:31.000]  point. Like that, that the whole point of this is so that they maintain their dignity.
[58:31.200 --> 58:33.840]  I'm doing it for free because they don't have any money.
[58:34.040 --> 58:36.160]  It's it's there is no play here.
[58:36.360 --> 58:39.840]  There is no this is if they had money, then they could pay for it.
[58:40.040 --> 58:41.200]  But they have no money.
[58:41.400 --> 58:42.640]  They're they're appealed.
[58:42.840 --> 58:44.600]  And so we have to subsidize.
[58:44.800 --> 58:48.920]  And if I put them on the fucking screen and I make them think like.
[58:49.120 --> 58:51.080]  It's weird, it's crazy shit, man.
[58:51.280 --> 58:52.440]  But it's the no more bonus.
[58:52.640 --> 58:53.520]  It's what I know.
[58:53.520 --> 58:55.320]  I know. I understand it.
[58:55.320 --> 58:57.360]  But it's crazy that that's what they're looking for.
[58:57.560 --> 59:02.160]  That's just trying to push it as a way to sell it to the next person as fast as
[59:02.360 --> 59:05.000]  possible. And that's where the compassion is gone in.
[59:05.200 --> 59:09.800]  And it's just about the almighty dollar of big business that's coming.
[59:10.000 --> 59:12.360]  We could have changed it if we'd have thought this way earlier.
[59:12.360 --> 59:16.240]  That's why I say we probably still can if we would figure out how to band together
[59:16.240 --> 59:19.760]  instead of trying to figure out the differences that we have, the plants, what
[59:19.960 --> 59:23.160]  we're about, and that's all we need to worry about at this point.
[59:23.360 --> 59:28.360]  None of the other stuff, the branding, any of that, whatever can get us to keep
[59:28.560 --> 59:31.480]  it from being taken completely from us.
[59:31.680 --> 59:33.600]  That's what we should be trying to get at
[59:33.800 --> 59:37.360]  instead of fucking trying to just separate each other as much as possible.
[59:37.560 --> 59:42.480]  Business is coming and we have to do it, but we don't have to do it their way.
[59:42.680 --> 59:45.120]  No, no. It's why I love home growers to me.
[59:45.320 --> 59:49.880]  My favorite person on the planet's the fucking tensor with two lights, one light
[59:50.040 --> 59:53.320]  because they're producing flour at their home for themselves and they're completely
[59:53.520 --> 59:55.280]  out of the system. They told us this.
[59:55.480 --> 59:56.720]  Fuck you. Fuck you.
[59:56.920 --> 59:59.160]  You buy your own shit, do whatever you fuck you want.
[59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.280]  And then you see radical level of sharing.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:07.880]  You see a far more reasonable approach to human behavior.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.240]  Yeah.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.800]  And it's crazy because, you know, I never in my life thought like,
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.560]  you know, the years I've been trafficking and all this shit, I'm like,
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:20.360]  it's just weird where you're the only people that seem normal of the career
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.960]  criminals.
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:28.080]  Then we had fucking it was honor amongst thieves and not because we thought we were
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.400]  thieves, but because the system did and if we had honor amongst ourselves,
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.480]  our word was bond. That's all that mattered.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.760]  And that's what we were living for.
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.040]  That's not what it's about anymore.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.120]  You can buy your own fucking way into a
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.200]  situation or just snake your way in there.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.920]  And people automatically just think because you're visible that you must be OK.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.200]  They don't do any kind of research on you.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.680]  There's nothing in the backside.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.640]  No one says nothing back in the day.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.440]  You couldn't fuck around or you were going
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:59.040]  to be part of the system because it would be all taken from us.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.080]  They just didn't fucking do it that way.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.320]  Hold it up.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.280]  Mentality.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.320]  A little, but, you know, that stuff like this, though, it's it's you, you get people
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:16.280]  together to try, and that's why I love I love fundraisers in these regards, because
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.880]  the the.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.800]  The group that gets together is usually
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.120]  pretty real and the reasons are real, and so to me, you know, I.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:30.760]  It gives me hope that you'll see a new paradigm emerge,
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:36.560]  and I think that with the younger kids of today, they've been lied to and shit on so
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.640]  much, that's why none of them want to get a fucking job.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.600]  Everyone's like, they're lazy.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.320]  They don't want to work.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.200]  Who the fuck wants to get a job and not get paid and struggle?
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.560]  Like, why?
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.640]  So what they're saying is we don't like the system is broken.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:49.600]  That's your shit.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.720]  We'll build a new one.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.640]  And I think that the kids of today, in a lot of ways, will be a lot nicer than all
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.880]  of us, I think it's just like I watch them online.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.960]  They're not they they're not as triggered.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.360]  They don't do the same shit.
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.880]  They know how to, like, engage in a different way.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.480]  And so what I see is I see that change
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:11.400]  coming, it's just that it never comes quick enough when you're in it.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.880]  Yeah.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.720]  So just
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.680]  I feel that.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:25.400]  With the fundraising, let me so the other one was there is.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:29.480]  So Jackson sent down.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.120]  A bunch of root beer freezes, purple
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:40.400]  unicorn gelato, 33 cherry limeades and then the T1000 gelato, 33 cherry limeade.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.160]  Any thoughts on that stuff?
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.680]  Well, that'll be some fire, man.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.720]  With the root beer is hot as fuck and the root is kind of cool in that
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:50.760]  we opened up for that Soto project.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.080]  I got the root beer clone.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:57.280]  So like the original root beer clone from Gene Leo hit with the CDSR a decade ago.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:00.840]  And I got the seeds from them and put them away.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.320]  And they gave me as a gift, you know, and I just put them away.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.000]  And then the root beer blows up and it's
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.440]  hot as fuck and I'm just chilling on the seeds.
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.880]  And then Josh wants to do a project for the region conference.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.000]  And so I break them out because I figured it'd be prime time.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:21.760]  And when we popped open, they have to on that that first step, one of that
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.640]  root beer clone to the Cam Dogs special man out of that root beer work came like
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:31.760]  Sarsaparilla, Coca-Cola, root beer, vanilla.
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:36.440]  So, you know, you had some really interesting soda profiles.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.880]  On top of that, fuel.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.560]  So anything with that with that root beer is interesting.
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:46.480]  And then that gelato with any of his with his cherry lime, his cherry lime is monster.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.080]  It just it just brings a profile that's wicked.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.480]  So any of this stuff is solid and and if
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.880]  Gene's running it, mostly it's all sorted outside.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.320]  So you have some dependability and you can you and you get some expectations
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.240]  and Gene, somebody who runs his workout or works with people who runs the workout.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.520]  So it's not untested.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:05.880]  He's got a pretty good idea.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.600]  So I think that people grab a hold of it.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.160]  They should they should do really well.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:15.640]  Yeah, one just on a random note,
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:20.360]  someone, you know, pretty well, Eric from HBK,
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.480]  some people down here in L.A. have been asking me about Chili Verde.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:29.320]  And I I'm actually I want to find the time
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.360]  and the space to grow it out myself because.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.640]  Pete, people are excited that it's kind of interesting and unique.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:43.960]  It is you've got that lavender in it, so it gives it a different profile.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:49.360]  And you know, he breeds it and then it gets into Vogue.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.320]  It wins, you know, an Emerald Cup and you see it woven in because it's got a
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.320]  different direction.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:59.560]  And it's just that the bummer is that, you know, Eric didn't really benefit from it
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.800]  in the way that you would like to have seen benefit because, you know, you breed
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  something that is successful, even if you look at like look at Sherb.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.040]  So I was talking to Mario the other day.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.600]  Right. So Mario comes up with the Sunset Sherbet.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.600]  Then he comes up with gelato,
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:18.040]  two of the biggest fucking plants in the last 10 years right in the world.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:23.320]  But he wasn't he wasn't thinking about it in the way of let me license this shit
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:28.400]  and control the genomic form so it's everywhere and he's not getting paid on it.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.080]  Well, I also think one of Eric's frustrations
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:37.720]  will ultimately experienced wasn't the best of the chili verde like they got
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:43.880]  cuts that were not the best cuts and then people would grow it out and be like, OK,
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:50.240]  it's like, OK, but it wasn't kind of like what he what he knows it is.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:54.120]  Totally. But the problem was, is that he was kind of like like with a lot of
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:59.600]  breeding, right, you can do the breeding, but sometimes it might not be best if you
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:03.680]  don't release it for seven to 10 years because you're in the wrong time.
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:08.800]  And so when Eric put that chili verde out, it was the era of gas.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.240]  And so it just it didn't make the grab.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:16.680]  It wasn't people weren't like, oh, my fucking God, I got to get my hands on it.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.920]  It wasn't until we really started getting
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:23.600]  into the era of fruit and and going into some of these suites
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:28.600]  that that stuff started to emerge as a contemporary because it has the color.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.600]  It's got the structure and it's got an interesting nose and mouth.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:38.440]  So it fits in today far better than when he really bred it.
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.920]  So he breeds something, but when you breed
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:47.480]  something in the in the in the gas era that's not dominant gas, it ain't going.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.360]  And so it's the same thing right now.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.600]  You go to gas heavy.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.440]  You don't see people go in the same route.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.320]  So it's going to be applicability to a time period.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.920]  And I just think that.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.760]  His work was excellent.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.720]  He just got it out early and it didn't resonate.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.800]  And then by the time he's able to get it
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:12.200]  into the system, he's done with the seed company and he's just having a hard time.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.360]  And so hopefully he's able to go over it.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.440]  He's going over to Thailand, I think, pretty soon.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.720]  Hopefully, like a couple of weeks.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:21.120]  Yeah. Get a new beginning over there because
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.600]  it's a smart guy and he's a good guy.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.560]  But, you know, you
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:29.720]  you if you're not looking at herb from a brutal business point of view, man,
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.360]  you're just going to get worked over there.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.680]  Everything has to be so you have to you have to when someone does that, does
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.600]  a contract, I'm like sign a contract, means get a fucking lawyer.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.640]  So it's going to cost you a couple of grand for any time you want to do a contract.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.920]  It cost me 10 for one of my contracts because I had my lawyer rewrite the whole
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:51.560]  fucking thing. But if it's important, if there's real money involved and it's
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:56.400]  long money for time, then you need to make sure your lawyers are protecting you.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.720]  Well, the average individual doesn't have
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:02.480]  10 grand to throw at a lawyer every time they want to look at a contract.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:09.120]  And so you don't have an ability to shape the contract to fit your needs.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.240]  You just look at it and sign it and you're
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:15.280]  not quite clear that this shit is not what you want to sign.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:19.440]  And so hopefully with Eric's able to bring some of the genes over to Thailand
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:23.240]  and then be able to start working some of his populations there, because on the
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:28.520]  indoors they would go and then maybe do some hybridization and start his career
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.680]  again, because he's definitely a talented kid.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.080]  And I've always liked Eric, always respected him as a person.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.880]  Now, that's what I told him.
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:42.400]  I hope he doesn't hang up the cleats because as frustrated as he is that
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:46.720]  like and that guy right there, too, it's like talent.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.840]  Right. And
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.880]  the world's a better place with with the talented people doing good work.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.040]  It's hard to maintain the motivation, though.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:01.200]  That's the thing is that talent, talent does what it does.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:02.920]  Right. To me, that's like inherent.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120]  Born with talent.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.360]  Like it's you can't fucking conceal it.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.520]  Put it that way so we can develop talent.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:16.400]  But it doesn't go from like zero talent to fucking talent like you see hints.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.760]  It's about being able to maintain the
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:24.160]  emotional stability when you're being invalidated as a small person.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.520]  And so you're doing incredible work, but you're getting fucked and not getting
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:32.520]  paid and people are crying about it's not what they what they want here.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:35.320]  And and so you you end up having to deal
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.320]  with so much peripheral shit that you can't do the core business and get the
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.840]  affirmation you need, which is the feel good from the work.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.760]  So if I do my job and I just get paid, it's cool.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.240]  It's better if I get paid.
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.200]  And someone says, that's a nice job. Thank you.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.360]  If you feel you feel like you're part of something.
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:58.720]  But when you don't get a thank you or a fucking paycheck, what exactly sustains you
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.520]  in this process? And so, you know, it's the same thing with
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.240]  like me working out of country right now, it's.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.120]  I would rather work here in Humboldt County at the farm.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.520]  But if you're running an outdoor farm right now, you are losing money.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.480]  So why would I do that and then dislike my craft?
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.120]  The very thing that I've spent my whole
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:25.200]  life doing, I try my very fucking best not to damage my love of it,
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:29.840]  because if you steal this from me, you've stolen a huge chunk of my life.
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:34.720]  And and I enjoy what I do and I find value in it.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.800]  And so I have to go where there's a potential.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.120]  And if it's in a if it's to go run into a fucking meat grinder, I ain't doing that
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.720]  shit. I'm too old. When I was 20, man, I'd run right into a
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:47.040]  blender thinking I could run around the blades.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:51.600]  But at 56, my fuck, I'm good.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.040]  I'm just going to stay and I'm going to hang with my friends and I'm going to work
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.440]  with other people that I know that are about it so that what we're able to do is
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:04.880]  maintain our our emotional stability while you're taking a brutal beating
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.840]  because you've got to come out of it at some point.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.400]  But if you can't stay emotionally stable,
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:14.560]  it's too hard and you end up you just go off course.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:20.840]  Yeah, I think, you know, in terms of getting old, I think about like little
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:25.880]  things like my like my what is it, farsighted where like you can't see stuff
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:29.400]  up close, like my eyes are getting worse and worse.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:34.560]  So just like all those things you take for granted about like even looking at buds
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:39.680]  or something like I'm picking here here are some worms I've been picking out of
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:42.600]  buds and stuff, but like.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:48.520]  To not have good vision of of like close up stuff anymore sucks and it's just
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:54.200]  I got glasses, too, you know, and but it's just it's it's it's it's it's it's what it
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:58.520]  is, you accept it, it's it's that I'm not angry that I have to wear glasses.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.200]  I'm grateful that I have them.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:05.160]  But what what I what I know and what we're doing is that when you're trying
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.520]  to maintain a creative edge.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.960]  There has to be an internal
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.840]  quality or you become too fucking eccentric.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.920]  You know, you're cutting off the air to give it to a prostitute.
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.040]  So you got Van Gogh who's putting together art that's unreal,
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:25.400]  but he's fucking lopping off body parts to impress a chick.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.640]  You know, that's not the route I'm trying to go.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.080]  And that's how I feel sometimes is that
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:37.360]  they're asking us to cut off a fucking hand to play the game.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.080]  And and that's just not that's not the case.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.480]  And what you're doing is you're removing
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:46.440]  all the operators out of the system that were creative and had their own unique lane.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.400]  So now what we have is this one common pool and everything looks the same,
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.480]  behaves the same, it's like fucking Starbucks weed.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.080]  All the herbs are saying no matter where you go, it's the same shit.
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.720]  And
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:02.000]  it's dry, you know, and I don't mean dry like the Arabs dry,
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:04.600]  I mean, the fucking culture is dry.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.960]  And so, you know, you've got to be able to maintain some connections to the people
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:12.160]  that you play with so that you're able to kind of work it out together.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.320]  And a lot of us from the past, like we weren't really fucking needy.
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.600]  We were ballsy, like we were willing to break fucking law fully all the time.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:22.480]  So us being soft is really the issue.
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.040]  It's that we we felt like we were part
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:28.440]  of something because we had people around us that we trusted
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:32.320]  because we're all in the same situation where you make a mistake, you're going down.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.360]  And so being able to create that support
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.160]  system amongst us so that you add.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:42.880]  A can of family was pretty profound, and for me, I've been on my own a long time,
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.560]  so like my whole world was built in that community.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.720]  And so for me, I just got said I try to
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:53.080]  maintain my emotional state by working in places that are positive
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:58.640]  and working on projects that I'm about for myself and doing things with people
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:04.200]  that are have me that are cool so that I still feel like a human being.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.840]  You know, it's I mean, I feel like all three of us and a lot of people watching
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.960]  are kind of in similar boats where, like, I'm a one man shop and I'm in my
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:17.600]  garage ninety nine percent of the time and I'm dealing with like it's like my
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:23.360]  emotional roller coaster on a daily basis is like I feel like a pinball, right?
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:30.040]  Like I feel good at some points and like good about myself and about life.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:36.920]  And then at other points, I feel just beaten down and terrible and stressed.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.280]  And,
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:42.280]  you know, meanwhile, my emotions are just going like that.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.720]  And that's desired from the system.
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.560]  I mean, to me, when you can when you can
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:53.200]  take people pop the entire population and you can get them unstable.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:58.280]  You got them because you can never find the ground to be able to make plant your
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.760]  feet and make your forward progress.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.360]  You're always on your heels getting rolled over.
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:08.440]  And so what happens is you're never able to to make positive gains and you're never
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:13.360]  able to link up with people in a positive way because what the focus is, is the
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.160]  trouble, the turmoil I'm looking at the news right now.
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.040]  And all I see is nuclear threat. Right.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.240]  And I'm cracking up. I grew up with that shit.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:23.560]  And I'm like, this fucking shit just gets recycled over and over again.
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.320]  So now I got to be not only do I got to be afraid of the people that are running my
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.080]  country, but I got to be afraid of the people running other countries now, too.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.760]  And so at what point are you not in terror?
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.840]  What point are you not afraid?
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:39.080]  It's it's you're bombarded with it in every aspect of your life.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.640]  And cannabis was this escape from it because you had some autonomy.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:48.840]  And even though five was honest, they weren't honest every minute.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.320]  So there was moments that were golden.
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.960]  And then working with the cannabis community was really some beautiful,
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:58.960]  enjoyable times. And so you had this really quality of life that
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:03.360]  stabilized the troughs, you know, the hills and the valleys.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.800]  They kept it in a more reasonable range.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.840]  But now there's no stabilization.
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.080]  And every time you turn it around, you
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:12.080]  question and did you even fucking make the right choice?
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.280]  You know, that I piss away my whole life doing something I believed in.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:18.360]  And I'm like, well, fuck it, whether I did or I didn't, I did it.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.160]  And so I'm just dealing with it and going forward.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:25.680]  But it's not just us in cannabis, it's the entire fucking country.
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.880]  And really, it's the whole world.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:32.960]  And years prior, cannabis was the net that caught this this population that was
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.080]  struggling and they removed that net.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:39.680]  Cannabis is no longer a safety net for anybody.
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.040]  And so for all the people that have been
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:45.680]  using cannabis as that little net to keep you so you didn't feel like you were a
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.400]  wage slave at your job because you knew you made a little money out of the closet.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:53.120]  That little money out of the closet let you afford tires.
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:59.360]  It let you it let you, you know, take your your partner out for dinner on a special
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:02.560]  occasion, little little fucking details.
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.480]  It made people feel like they were they value.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:10.400]  And when you pull it all away, what you are now is you're a fucking ping pong ball
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:15.840]  getting knocked over a net and it's the same group knocking you over from both
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.760]  sides so that what happens is you're never able to ever rise up.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.160]  You're never able to unify.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.640]  You know, it's like with cannabis.
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.240]  We are every state went through the same
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:31.280]  exact trouble because not one fucking group caught from the one prior that you
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.480]  need to get together today and team up.
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.440]  And instead it was no, no, no.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:37.880]  I'm going to take over myself.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.680]  And then you got fucking rolled over.
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:42.080]  So every state got fucked because nobody
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.720]  wanted to get together and just say, look, there's two thousand of us, two thousand of
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.480]  us as a voice.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.240]  Nobody wanted to do it until it's too late.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.280]  Now everybody's screaming fucking unity
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.400]  and community, and I'm like, man, when the money was here, you fuckers would not
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:59.440]  about it and now you're the fucking loudest advocate for this shit.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:02.160]  And I'm laughing and I'm just like.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.000]  Any real.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:09.000]  Real's real, you know, and you can't you can't buy that part of it.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.320]  But it has to be given freely.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.880]  So, you know, we're all still here together,
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:19.960]  just older and older, uglier, you know what I mean?
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:24.480]  Now, I mean, it's like last night, you know, we had our weekly L.A.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:29.640]  event and, you know, people come and there was one guy who is like
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:33.880]  future cannabis project through like got me through covid.
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:38.480]  And so that's like the shit that in my head, I'm like,
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:43.080]  that's what makes me like feel good
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.640]  because of all this shit I have to deal with every day.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:49.600]  And then like hearing something like that or someone being like, you know,
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:58.200]  I'm all into, you know, making inputs in my yard and being sustainable.
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:02.920]  And I was never like that before watching
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:04.120]  the YouTube stuff.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.520]  And I'm like, that's that's what makes me happy.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:08.560]  Oh, well, fuck, man.
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:13.080]  Like, I mean, I support you for a long time because you've been a great platform
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:19.000]  for a lot of education, tremendous number of people were able to like watch the show
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.720]  and you're prolific with what you put out.
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.120]  So there's a lot of it.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:27.280]  And you bring in a lot of people to create programs around your program so that you
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:32.400]  have a lot of different directions and it it allows there to be benefit in a way
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.240]  that has to be done. You can't monetize everything you do in life.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:41.400]  The monetization, we have to kind of change how we see currency.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.520]  And there's a human currency and human currency is priceless.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:47.320]  Yeah, shit.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:51.600]  That makes you feel good about life and yourself and humanity.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:56.080]  And that's where the FC me like that's why every time you call me that I didn't
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.800]  jump on the show.
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.560]  And it's and it's it's it's just really to support and be part of something that I
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.520]  know is good because I know the mission's good.
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:09.360]  I know you you had a good mission for a long time and it's really awesome to be
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.920]  able to be part of it in a minor way.
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.240]  And it allows us to be able to bring that good part of cannabis out to the general
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:19.920]  public. So people who want to get involved in cannabis or get an education,
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:24.560]  they get a chance to to look and understand from a way that there's no one's trying
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:27.600]  to sell them anything. The information's the information.
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.440]  Even if there's sponsorship to the show,
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:33.960]  even if there's an agenda that's needed, that isn't stuck in your fucking face.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.080]  The entire time you're here.
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:40.320]  So what it does, it allows people to realize, hey, I'm getting something of value.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.680]  And yes, there has to be a monetization impact.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.360]  But I feel like I'm treated fairly.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:51.200]  And I just think that in society, that's just not common anymore,
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.280]  that we just look at you like a paycheck.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:56.400]  I was talking to my friends about that the other day about.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.840]  I mess around with some really wealthy
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:02.680]  people, but I don't I don't mess around with their money.
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:05.160]  I mess around with them as people
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:10.320]  and they enjoy hanging out because I don't go after their money.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:14.520]  I enjoy them as people and I have fun with them as people.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:19.760]  And I I take the money away so that we can just be people.
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.920]  And what it does, it allows them a moment
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:25.520]  to relax because I realize that they're like I use the same analogy.
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:28.440]  They're like beautiful women where everybody just sees you as a beautiful woman.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.080]  You're not you're not a human being.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:31.840]  You're just a good looking chick.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.600]  And you never get you never get any value greater than that.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.800]  And with people with money.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.480]  That's all people see them as is as a walking wallet.
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:43.720]  And all they want to do is go after the wallet.
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:48.200]  And what we've been taught this that it's you go after what you want.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.040]  You got to hustle and grind and work twenty five hours a day.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.480]  And I hear this crazy shit. Right.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.960]  And I'm like, listen, I work a lot of you fuckers.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.360]  You need to go to bed at some point.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:05.000]  And you can't look at the at the rapper or the objective as the primary thing.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.800]  The human is the primary thing.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  The girl decides if she wants you to be her friend.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:13.360]  The money the money is connected to a human hand.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:16.920]  The wallet doesn't come out of the pocket on its own and walk around the room.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.360]  The hand brings it out of the pocket.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.520]  And I think that we.
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.880]  We get so confused that to me,
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:26.760]  these conversations are valuable because we like this.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:31.600]  This is some theoretical stuff we're talking about sociological shit.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:35.760]  But a lot of the stuff we've gone into has been, you know,
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:41.920]  direction, technique, idea, and people can gather that and take it and benefit from it.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.080]  I know the number of people that have benefited.
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:45.880]  I get hit up all the time.
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.640]  And it's so much of it was through the work we've done together.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:55.680]  And and it was it's beautiful because you put together a platform where people
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:23:01.560]  that wanted to learn about cannabis got access and I know they benefited.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:07.040]  And that's that's not a bad way to live life.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:12.240]  You know, yeah, no, I think also like I think you two are examples of it.
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:17.480]  And I actually like I reached out to Crockett to to onboard him as a breeder
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:21.640]  because I someone
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.040]  I think was on maybe Facebook or something,
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:29.360]  just had some really nice stuff to say about him as someone like
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:33.600]  Crockett was at a some event, you know,
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:37.840]  selling seeds and this guy was like, you know, I was a nobody.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:44.840]  I went up to him and he didn't like size me up to be like, what can I get?
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.200]  Like, you know, a lot of times you go to a conference or an event and people kind
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:51.440]  of like look at your name tag to like determine how important you are and
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:54.800]  whether you're worth their time to to even talk to.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.920]  And then other people will just talk to
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:01.240]  anybody because they enjoy just meeting people and talking and Crockett.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:06.720]  And I know you like I've a million people have been like, Kevin.
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:14.000]  I came up to him, I'm a nobody, and he gave me an hour of his time and wasn't
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:20.400]  like looking past me to see, you know, who maybe is more important there to talk to.
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:25.000]  And and that's like I hate going to events
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:28.680]  where everybody's looking at your name tag to determine whether you're,
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:32.840]  you know, worth it for their to drive their business goals forward.
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.120]  Well, that's why I look homeless.
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.600]  I mean, people trip up.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:39.640]  But like I made it a fucking habit out of looking homeless at work
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.600]  because what it does is it lets me get a really clear view you quickly
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.640]  because everyone would come in and I would speak to him.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.600]  I say, yo, you need some help.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.440]  And they'd be like, no, I need to talk to somebody who knows what they're doing.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.840]  I need to talk to somebody important.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.640]  And I'd be like, I have a broom or something.
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.880]  Oh, well, they're all in the office.
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.560]  That's where all the power people live.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:02.520]  Then they'd have to bring them back to talk to me in person.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:04.000]  And they were horrified.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:06.600]  And like to me, I just love that shit
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.840]  because you're you're you're so busy trying to find the rank so that you can
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.560]  do the thing, let's me know you don't have any rank.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:19.200]  If the minute the minute you have to fucking chase rank, you don't have any rank.
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:22.920]  And the the rank is that we're all human beings.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:26.040]  And so for me, being able to,
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:30.840]  you know, just be involved with the community in the way it's just it's a gift.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.640]  And what I realize is that it's a thank you
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:41.000]  to for taking the time to listen to us online, where if you if you spent two hours
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:45.520]  listening to an interview and you come and bump into me in person and say, yo, I
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:49.160]  watch that interview and I I'm like, wow, you spent two hours of your time.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.720]  I owe you.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:54.360]  And as long as you're polite, like as long as you cool, I'm cool.
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:57.520]  And even if you're a fucking nut, man, I get guys that grab me by my shirt.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:59.560]  They're so intense. They have to talk to you.
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:02.840]  I'm like, listen, you can hold on to my shirt, but you're going to take it off
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:08.200]  by the arm because I have to walk so we can walk together while you hold me.
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.840]  And I'll let you talk to me the entire way up to the fucking stage,
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.720]  but then I got to let you go.
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.400]  And what it does, it just it lets people
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.960]  express themselves in the way they know how or can.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:24.320]  And and I think that there's a price to pay
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:29.880]  for fame where, like you become well known, there's a debt to the people who
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:36.200]  acknowledge you and that debt is just simply acknowledgement that they're valid, too.
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.400]  And and it's it's really simple.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.680]  It doesn't have to be profound, but for me,
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.960]  the the regular people that aren't like superstars in the world, man,
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:52.000]  the number the number of regular people I met 10, 15 years ago that are superstars now
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.520]  is incredible.
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:57.720]  And so much of it was that there were people who wanted to be in our world so
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:01.880]  badly, they were willing to work really hard and then they meet you and they're
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:07.560]  like, yo, you were like a like a star in the sky that I navigate from.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.680]  And when you don't burn them, when they when you see them.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:15.960]  It allows them to be able to validate the work and go forward.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:18.200]  So what we end up having down the road is
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.760]  all these professionals that are together that we were all part of their process.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:28.320]  And that's not bad, man, to be able to be part of something.
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.680]  That's better to help build an industry,
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:35.840]  to create a different different feel on people, so, you know, and I don't
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:39.560]  I catch a lot of chicks, I do a lot of fucking crazy stuff, but
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:44.400]  the main point is in real life, I'm the same fucking dude every day.
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:45.840]  It doesn't change.
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:48.680]  And that's the part that that.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:52.640]  Is important because what it does, it allows people to be able to feel
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:57.040]  comfortable and confident with the decisions they made pertaining to you.
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.640]  And now you're able to start being able
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:02.880]  to assist in work so collaboratively we'll have a better life.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:06.040]  Just like you were saying, if we had started this shit early.
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.520]  I just catch the lessons later, but at least I caught them and then I go
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.400]  from there with what I know so I didn't have to go all the way to the end
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:16.360]  of the fucking road before I figured it out.
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:20.440]  I was able to get into really what the gist of cannabis was in my 40s.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.240]  And I've been in since I was fucking 12.
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:28.440]  Right. So I got 28 years of being in weed before I even realize.
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:31.280]  What it really is, and then once I really
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:36.120]  understand it, then now I have another 15 on top of that.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.400]  It's big.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.600]  Hey, check it out. I got to I got to jump in like two, three minutes.
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.120]  I got another thing coming up now.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.560]  We can wrap it up.
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.360]  I as I was looking at the time, I was like,
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:51.760]  I remember I asked him if he had like 20 minutes,
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.280]  but we appreciate it.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:29:00.240]  All right. So just quickly, we're raising money for a good cause.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.960]  We will a lot of people know what it is.
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.560]  There are reasons why we don't want to
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:12.920]  broadcast what it is, but we're going to there's some packs available.
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:21.080]  We're going to do a an actual like auction style fundraiser, hopefully in the next.
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.640]  Probably not this next week,
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:29.880]  everything for me is like dependent on my kids schedule,
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:35.560]  but the week after and again, this is like when people talk about having
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:40.920]  learned like the guy last night, but also these types of things,
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:47.040]  the fundraisers, it's what makes me feel really good.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:52.520]  I also have always liked that, like this community like
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.800]  comes together and raises money for shit all the time.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.440]  And I just think of like the aspects of society that kind of look down on people
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:06.000]  who smoke weed and it's kind of like, well, we just raise money for fire,
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:10.480]  like people who lost their homes to fires or some guy with a medical condition or
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:14.800]  this or Harry, right, a small business owner.
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:20.880]  And and that that makes me I mean, I don't even know what to say,
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:27.480]  it just stuff like that makes me happy and you and you, you, you.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:31.720]  You did a really good job creating a platform that allows a lot of this to occur.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:35.040]  And so it's that's why I support you.
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.240]  Right.
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:40.320]  I don't I don't even really do content like that's the irony.
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.480]  I mean, fucking everything. But I don't really do content.
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:47.400]  I I only appear when I think there's value to be shared.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:51.320]  And there's never been a time you call me that I didn't jump on a fucking cast.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:52.680]  So I appreciate that.
[01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.400]  Yeah, no, I appreciate you.
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:58.760]  You did something great because it allows there to be a place for a lot of people
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:04.120]  to get together and get education and do some really good common core shit.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.200]  So thank you and good to see your face, too, brother.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:08.440]  Much love to you, brother.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:09.760]  Kevin, I miss you, man.
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:12.840]  I have much love and respect for you and your whole family.
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.720]  But you do, baby. Say hi to your mama for me.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.000]  I will do that. All right, guys.
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:19.200]  Peace. All right.
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.000]  Thanks, everyone.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:23.600]  Peace out, Kevin. Much love to you, Kevin.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:28.000]  And Peter, same thing that he said, man, I appreciate you for doing this and putting
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:32.240]  something together for people to be able to come put their passion about this plant
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:36.120]  in a way that besides just making sales and shit where they can share.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.080]  Well, it's all I mean, it's you.
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:40.280]  I mean, you drop knowledge, right?
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:41.600]  Like and Kevin will come.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.560]  I mean, that's
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:47.520]  that's what makes me happy is is
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:51.240]  just people like.
[01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:57.720]  Like Harry, you know, he was talking about how he is kind of at a time in his life
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:01.400]  where like he he wants to pass that knowledge forward and have other people
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:07.200]  like I love learning, I love just even if it's stuff that I don't do,
[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:11.320]  like, you know, I'll like how stuff's made, right?
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.760]  Like how bowling balls are made and like
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:17.600]  random shit where I'm like, that's pretty cool.
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:19.920]  I just like learning how stuff works.
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:21.440]  And
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:23.560]  you're always someone who's willing to
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:28.600]  share as is Kevin, as are as are other people and never kind of like in a way
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:32.680]  where it's like, what can I get out of these people?
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.000]  And that's kind of what I was getting at
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.960]  with the events were like, I, I, I would rather be at an event and talk to and
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:45.520]  hang out with all the nice people who maybe business wise can't do anything for
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:51.800]  me, but I had a good time here and.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:56.240]  And so, yeah, and
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:03.360]  on the the topic of the fundraiser, it's
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.560]  all I'm going to reach out to some.
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:09.440]  I mean, I hope you see who who loves you.
[01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:13.240]  I mean, those were the first guys I reached out to and they were like, fuck.
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:16.160]  Yeah. So I want that to sink in with you.
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:20.160]  I don't know what they think of you as a human being
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.720]  because you're a good one and Kevin's a good one like that.
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:27.720]  That's for me, like with this stuff, like I'd rather
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:31.200]  be doing those people who I just think are good human beings.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:32.920]  It's the same thing, like people who are
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:36.080]  interesting and who are good human beings,
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.280]  that that's the joy in life.
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:44.160]  There's a lot of men in this community for sure.
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:49.440]  There's a lot of white noise, but there's there's also a lot of good people.
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:52.640]  I've met came out of the cannabis community.
