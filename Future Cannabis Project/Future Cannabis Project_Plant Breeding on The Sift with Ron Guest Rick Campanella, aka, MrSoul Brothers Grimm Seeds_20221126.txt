[00:00.000 --> 00:31.600]  We got a few minutes.
[00:31.600 --> 00:33.400]  Good afternoon, everybody.
[00:33.400 --> 00:35.720]  Welcome to another episode of The Sift.
[00:35.720 --> 00:37.720]  We've got a wonderful guest that's
[00:37.720 --> 00:40.160]  coming on from Brothers Grimm.
[00:40.160 --> 00:45.800]  He's the inventor of Cinderella 99 and many other ones, too.
[00:45.800 --> 00:49.080]  And here he is, Mr. Soul himself.
[00:49.080 --> 00:50.480]  Hello, welcome.
[00:50.480 --> 00:52.200]  Hey, welcome to you.
[00:52.200 --> 00:54.280]  Thanks for tuning in, everybody.
[00:54.280 --> 00:56.780]  Appreciate being on the show today.
[00:56.780 --> 00:59.180]  And hope everybody's feeling well.
[00:59.180 --> 01:01.500]  We just came off of Thanksgiving week here.
[01:01.500 --> 01:03.860]  And in our household, we had the flu.
[01:03.860 --> 01:06.980]  So we're all starting to get back our strength
[01:06.980 --> 01:08.780]  and feeling pretty good today.
[01:08.780 --> 01:11.900]  So you chose the right time.
[01:11.900 --> 01:13.820]  Where are you at right now?
[01:13.820 --> 01:16.300]  Are you in California?
[01:16.300 --> 01:18.540]  No, we live in Colorado.
[01:18.540 --> 01:20.020]  OK, yeah, I knew that.
[01:20.020 --> 01:23.940]  But I saw something on a website that said San Diego, California.
[01:23.940 --> 01:25.500]  And my mom and dad live there.
[01:25.780 --> 01:31.300]  Yeah, San Diego is where our associate Mark, he lives there.
[01:31.300 --> 01:32.740]  Ah, that's what I saw then.
[01:32.740 --> 01:33.820]  I just saw that.
[01:33.820 --> 01:36.580]  OK, well, it's great.
[01:36.580 --> 01:40.300]  Yeah, he's a marketing and publicity person.
[01:40.300 --> 01:44.180]  So that's probably why you saw his name and address associated
[01:44.180 --> 01:45.980]  with getting me on the show.
[01:45.980 --> 01:48.180]  Yeah, he's doing a bang up job.
[01:48.180 --> 01:52.580]  I've seen an increased presence over the last year.
[01:52.580 --> 01:53.580]  Oh, totally, yeah.
[01:53.740 --> 01:54.940]  Oh, totally, yeah.
[01:54.940 --> 01:56.340]  He's responsible for that.
[01:56.340 --> 01:57.260]  He's a great guy.
[01:57.260 --> 01:59.980]  And he's got his finger on the pulse of the public
[01:59.980 --> 02:05.060]  and seems to know what they want and tells me what to give them.
[02:05.060 --> 02:09.220]  And so we've been working in combination really nicely.
[02:09.220 --> 02:13.460]  So he and my wife also are sort of teamed up
[02:13.460 --> 02:18.820]  to do that side of the promotion of the website and all that.
[02:18.820 --> 02:20.740]  So it's a match made in heaven.
[02:20.740 --> 02:23.860]  We're all working together like a well-oiled machine.
[02:23.860 --> 02:26.860]  So great to be part of it all.
[02:26.860 --> 02:30.180]  Yeah, that's what I needed as like my wife helps me out,
[02:30.180 --> 02:33.580]  but we're no PR geniuses.
[02:33.580 --> 02:35.980]  Well, hey, let's dig into a couple of questions
[02:35.980 --> 02:37.580]  that I've got.
[02:37.580 --> 02:39.540]  I've heard little bits and pieces,
[02:39.540 --> 02:42.180]  but tell me the back story on Cindy99.
[02:42.180 --> 02:45.100]  I grew it a couple of years ago for the first time
[02:45.100 --> 02:47.700]  where I knew I had the real deal because it was explained
[02:47.700 --> 02:49.780]  to me how it tastes and looks.
[02:49.780 --> 02:53.020]  Tell me a little bit about how you got there.
[02:53.020 --> 02:57.180]  Well, I was living in Belgium for a couple of years.
[02:57.180 --> 03:00.060]  And then I knew that I'd be returning to the States
[03:00.060 --> 03:05.220]  and wanting to grow my own again.
[03:05.220 --> 03:08.060]  So I went up to Amsterdam and I did some shopping
[03:08.060 --> 03:09.300]  around for seeds.
[03:09.300 --> 03:11.780]  And of course, stopped in the coffee shops
[03:11.780 --> 03:15.420]  and smoked what was available over the counter.
[03:15.420 --> 03:18.900]  And one of my favorites was always a Jack Harer.
[03:18.900 --> 03:21.020]  And so I bought some Jack Harer bud
[03:21.020 --> 03:24.340]  and a little coffee shop in Amsterdam on the canals there
[03:24.340 --> 03:27.540]  in the red light district, a place called the Sensi Smile.
[03:27.540 --> 03:32.540]  I don't think it exists anymore, but this was 19,
[03:32.660 --> 03:35.180]  let's see, 96.
[03:35.180 --> 03:40.060]  So 1996, I'm there and I buy some Jack Harer.
[03:40.060 --> 03:43.300]  I start breaking it up on the table to roll a joint
[03:43.300 --> 03:46.620]  and a couple of seeds unexpectedly came out
[03:46.620 --> 03:47.540]  of one of the buds.
[03:47.540 --> 03:50.300]  And so I saved them along with the seeds I had bought
[03:50.300 --> 03:51.860]  to bring back to the States.
[03:51.860 --> 03:54.740]  And I was planning a trip to come back
[03:54.740 --> 03:55.780]  and live in the States.
[03:55.780 --> 03:58.660]  And so I put all the seeds together.
[03:58.660 --> 04:00.700]  And when I got to the States and started growing,
[04:00.700 --> 04:03.260]  it turned out those extra seeds that fell out
[04:03.260 --> 04:07.060]  of the Jack Harer bud grew into more spectacular plants
[04:07.060 --> 04:10.380]  than the ones that I had bought in the shops
[04:10.380 --> 04:13.060]  for seeds that I had been planning to grow
[04:13.060 --> 04:16.280]  based on their reputation, that type of thing.
[04:16.280 --> 04:18.840]  And one of these plants that came out of those seeds
[04:18.840 --> 04:21.600]  was a princess, I called her.
[04:21.600 --> 04:26.600]  And at that time it was very difficult to get a cultivar
[04:26.680 --> 04:30.080]  to grow indoors that had a sativa profile
[04:30.080 --> 04:32.360]  that didn't kind of grow outside of the room.
[04:32.360 --> 04:36.320]  You know, in those days it was mostly land-raised sativas
[04:36.320 --> 04:41.320]  from Thailand and other places where they had seasons
[04:41.540 --> 04:44.120]  that were very long and, you know,
[04:44.120 --> 04:46.000]  the plants could take forever to flower.
[04:46.720 --> 04:47.920]  And they got huge.
[04:47.920 --> 04:50.400]  Well, we love that sativa flavor
[04:50.400 --> 04:52.920]  and we love the sativa high as an energetic,
[04:52.920 --> 04:55.160]  uplifting high instead of the sleepy Colombian
[04:55.160 --> 04:57.320]  and Mexican stuff that we had been getting in the States
[04:57.320 --> 04:59.600]  for the decades before that.
[04:59.600 --> 05:03.240]  And so this particular individual had a profile
[05:03.240 --> 05:07.520]  of the sativa, but it was a compact, smaller plant
[05:07.520 --> 05:12.440]  that stayed short, bushy, and yet at the same time,
[05:12.440 --> 05:14.640]  didn't take very long to flower.
[05:14.640 --> 05:18.040]  It was a eight week maturation process
[05:18.040 --> 05:19.280]  during the flowering period.
[05:19.280 --> 05:21.360]  You know, when you flip to 12-12,
[05:21.360 --> 05:24.360]  the eight weeks later this plant would be done
[05:24.360 --> 05:27.200]  and it produced really psychoactive weed
[05:27.200 --> 05:30.040]  that got you that energetic buzz
[05:31.000 --> 05:32.960]  as well as tasting like a pineapple.
[05:32.960 --> 05:37.440]  So there was so many nice things about this one.
[05:37.440 --> 05:40.580]  I thought at the time we were all communicating
[05:40.580 --> 05:44.980]  on a sort of rudimentary internet of the late nineties
[05:44.980 --> 05:48.500]  where there were message boards and private chat rooms
[05:48.500 --> 05:49.500]  and things like that.
[05:49.500 --> 05:51.140]  It's very different than today,
[05:51.140 --> 05:55.660]  but I got invited into a group called the 77,
[05:55.660 --> 05:58.660]  which was basically a combination
[06:01.500 --> 06:03.660]  of different growers and breeders
[06:03.660 --> 06:05.700]  that through word of mouth,
[06:05.700 --> 06:07.900]  we'd kind of found out about each other,
[06:07.900 --> 06:09.340]  or, you know, someone would say,
[06:09.380 --> 06:11.660]  hey, we ought to have this person become a member
[06:11.660 --> 06:13.020]  and be part of our group.
[06:13.020 --> 06:15.860]  And well, to make a long story short,
[06:15.860 --> 06:17.920]  if it's not too late for that,
[06:17.920 --> 06:20.620]  I started telling these guys about what I had
[06:20.620 --> 06:24.280]  and that I would love to be able to make a seed line
[06:24.280 --> 06:27.960]  that would reproduce this plant for everybody, you know?
[06:27.960 --> 06:29.860]  So that's how it started.
[06:29.860 --> 06:34.000]  I thought, how can I take this one individual plant
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.380]  and make it into something that everybody can grow,
[06:36.700 --> 06:39.980]  buy the seeds and bring it home for themselves?
[06:41.580 --> 06:46.580]  So I thought when you combine male and female,
[06:47.220 --> 06:49.300]  when two organisms, let's say,
[06:49.300 --> 06:53.360]  we won't even be specific about cannabis, even humans,
[06:53.360 --> 06:55.780]  we all got half our genes from our mother
[06:55.780 --> 06:57.540]  and half our genes from our father, right?
[06:57.540 --> 07:01.660]  So with that idea in mind, as simplistic as it sounds,
[07:01.660 --> 07:05.880]  what I did was I found that by crossing princess to a male,
[07:06.780 --> 07:10.220]  it was obviously the seeds from that plant
[07:10.220 --> 07:13.780]  would then give us something that had half their genes
[07:13.780 --> 07:16.660]  coming from this particular female.
[07:16.660 --> 07:19.620]  Well, if you take that through several generations
[07:19.620 --> 07:22.140]  and you grow out the seed,
[07:22.140 --> 07:25.660]  the first generation is gonna be 50% the mother.
[07:25.660 --> 07:27.780]  And then the second generation,
[07:27.780 --> 07:30.100]  if you grow those same seeds
[07:30.100 --> 07:31.980]  and cross them back to that same mother,
[07:31.980 --> 07:35.380]  because remember now, we're growing indoors,
[07:35.380 --> 07:37.300]  we're able to keep a clone,
[07:37.300 --> 07:39.080]  we're able to keep a mother plant
[07:39.080 --> 07:41.860]  and only flower cuttings from that mother plant.
[07:41.860 --> 07:45.460]  And then so you're able to breed
[07:45.460 --> 07:49.040]  through several generations with the same plant.
[07:49.040 --> 07:52.360]  And that was not possible back in a couple hundred years ago
[07:52.360 --> 07:53.460]  before indoor lighting.
[07:53.460 --> 07:56.220]  So I took advantage of that
[07:56.220 --> 08:01.020]  and I crossed the 50% generation back to the mother,
[08:01.020 --> 08:03.940]  which gave us 75% generation.
[08:03.940 --> 08:06.060]  And then that generation of 75%
[08:06.060 --> 08:08.300]  was bred back to the mother again,
[08:08.300 --> 08:11.140]  will give you 88% of the mother's genes.
[08:11.140 --> 08:14.780]  And then one more time be up to 94%.
[08:14.780 --> 08:17.260]  See, if you keep taking half each time
[08:17.260 --> 08:20.860]  and adding it to the 50% being contributed by the mother
[08:20.860 --> 08:23.140]  in each generation's breeding,
[08:23.140 --> 08:26.860]  you start getting closer and closer to 99%
[08:26.860 --> 08:28.980]  of the original females genes.
[08:28.980 --> 08:31.680]  And that's why I called it Cinderella 99,
[08:31.720 --> 08:34.640]  because we were getting close to being like 99%
[08:34.640 --> 08:36.280]  of that same female.
[08:36.280 --> 08:39.080]  And it was also 1999 by that time too.
[08:39.080 --> 08:43.360]  And so it took about three years to breed
[08:43.360 --> 08:46.280]  and I got the result that I wanted.
[08:46.280 --> 08:51.080]  I have a strain that reproduces itself reliably
[08:51.080 --> 08:53.920]  and gives you that sativa and pineapple
[08:53.920 --> 08:57.880]  and all that positive qualities that I wanted
[08:57.880 --> 09:01.000]  in a seed line that I could then produce
[09:01.320 --> 09:03.200]  and give away or sell.
[09:03.200 --> 09:04.900]  So that's how it started.
[09:05.920 --> 09:10.920]  Yeah, when you line breed stuff or back crossing,
[09:11.280 --> 09:12.360]  it's amazing how many,
[09:12.360 --> 09:15.520]  if you're making like your own little land race
[09:15.520 --> 09:17.240]  by doing your selection,
[09:17.240 --> 09:19.920]  that's why I called the show SIFT,
[09:19.920 --> 09:24.160]  because I think people that have the knack of selection
[09:24.160 --> 09:26.400]  are the ones that are on the cutting edge.
[09:26.400 --> 09:29.120]  I know people that don't do that
[09:29.120 --> 09:31.560]  and their stuff is never,
[09:31.560 --> 09:34.480]  it just never seems to get to the place
[09:34.480 --> 09:38.120]  where other people I know that really do a good job
[09:38.120 --> 09:41.120]  of selecting and sifting for what they want.
[09:41.120 --> 09:43.840]  So in addition to that 99%,
[09:43.840 --> 09:46.360]  you were adding little bits of love along the way
[09:46.360 --> 09:48.000]  with your sifting, I'm sure.
[09:48.840 --> 09:53.840]  Well, I mean, it is a matter of choosing along the way
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.640]  whenever one is breeding,
[09:55.640 --> 09:57.440]  selection is the most important thing
[09:57.480 --> 09:59.760]  as you'll hear people talk about.
[09:59.760 --> 10:03.160]  It's today, we'll have to touch the subject.
[10:03.160 --> 10:04.920]  I'd love to expand on this,
[10:04.920 --> 10:09.000]  but people speak of the F1s and 2s and 3s and 4s,
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.520]  which is almost like talking about
[10:11.520 --> 10:14.800]  what kind of a crank do you use on the front of your car?
[10:14.800 --> 10:19.000]  You know, we don't put cranks on the fronts of cars anymore.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.360]  You know, they have electric starters
[10:21.360 --> 10:24.300]  and the same thing with plant breeding.
[10:25.140 --> 10:27.820]  You don't need to do F3s and 4s and 5s
[10:27.820 --> 10:32.380]  and do all these multi-generational breedings
[10:32.380 --> 10:35.780]  in the way that was necessary back in the day
[10:35.780 --> 10:37.580]  before artificial lighting,
[10:37.580 --> 10:38.540]  because let's face it,
[10:38.540 --> 10:42.100]  every year seed had to come from last year's plants
[10:42.100 --> 10:45.820]  when you're growing outdoors and there is no indoor lighting.
[10:45.820 --> 10:49.700]  And so people will think like, oh, well, this is an F4,
[10:49.700 --> 10:51.940]  it's gotta be better than an F3.
[10:51.940 --> 10:53.780]  There's so much misinformation
[10:54.220 --> 10:55.740]  and just a lack of understanding
[10:55.740 --> 10:58.020]  of how any of this stuff even works
[10:58.020 --> 11:02.380]  that it always shocks me at how little people
[11:02.380 --> 11:05.380]  have picked up about breeding,
[11:05.380 --> 11:08.220]  which, I mean, this is what I do.
[11:08.220 --> 11:12.380]  And I don't know, it never seemed complicated to me,
[11:12.380 --> 11:14.500]  but it seems complicated to everybody else.
[11:14.500 --> 11:18.220]  And so I can expand on that a little more
[11:18.220 --> 11:21.220]  and why we don't have to do F4s and things like that anymore.
[11:21.220 --> 11:24.700]  But going back to the selection idea,
[11:24.700 --> 11:27.980]  if let's say someone did say, oh, but this is an F4,
[11:27.980 --> 11:29.540]  how can that not be as good as,
[11:29.540 --> 11:31.580]  how can that not be better than an F3?
[11:31.580 --> 11:35.540]  And I say, well, when the F3 generation was being created,
[11:36.540 --> 11:38.940]  what if the person who chose the two parents
[11:38.940 --> 11:40.500]  didn't choose well?
[11:40.500 --> 11:43.140]  It's the next generation is actually gonna be worse
[11:43.140 --> 11:45.660]  than the one before, not better.
[11:45.660 --> 11:49.220]  So the sifting as you know,
[11:49.220 --> 11:52.380]  or making good selections is what's going to determine
[11:52.380 --> 11:54.860]  the course of your breeding project
[11:54.860 --> 11:56.700]  and whether it's going to be something
[11:56.700 --> 11:59.740]  that's continually improving or getting worse.
[11:59.740 --> 12:01.860]  And it's very easy to make it go south.
[12:01.860 --> 12:06.460]  So it's not as simple as people think where,
[12:06.460 --> 12:09.580]  oh, the higher the F number, the more stable it is
[12:09.580 --> 12:12.460]  or the more true breeding or anything.
[12:12.460 --> 12:16.220]  That's only true in the most specific cases
[12:16.220 --> 12:19.060]  where everything has gone exactly right.
[12:19.900 --> 12:21.900]  And the likelihood of that is not that high.
[12:21.900 --> 12:25.460]  So back crossing and using the original genes
[12:25.460 --> 12:27.940]  from the original parents to create a set,
[12:27.940 --> 12:32.940]  a certain line of seed is so much more reliable.
[12:33.340 --> 12:34.220]  It's obvious.
[12:34.220 --> 12:37.540]  I mean, if you're saying, look, we have two parents
[12:37.540 --> 12:42.540]  that created this offspring and this batch of seeds
[12:42.580 --> 12:45.540]  turns out to be spectacular, let's say,
[12:46.460 --> 12:49.620]  what would be the point of then trying to breed further
[12:49.620 --> 12:51.300]  or changing that?
[12:51.300 --> 12:53.260]  You've locked in your formula.
[12:53.260 --> 12:56.820]  You have the two parents that create that strain.
[12:56.820 --> 13:01.220]  You'd simply keep them alive by keeping them in a veg state
[13:01.220 --> 13:02.940]  for as long as you need to.
[13:02.940 --> 13:05.460]  We have some clones that are over 30 years old.
[13:06.540 --> 13:08.940]  I have a princess and genius
[13:08.940 --> 13:12.180]  that were germinated originally 1996.
[13:12.180 --> 13:14.660]  And those cuts are still growing and living
[13:15.540 --> 13:16.380]  in my garden.
[13:16.380 --> 13:20.340]  So if you want the same thing,
[13:20.340 --> 13:22.340]  every time you just use the same recipe,
[13:22.340 --> 13:23.660]  you take the same two parents
[13:23.660 --> 13:25.860]  and you cross them over and over
[13:25.860 --> 13:28.620]  and you're always gonna get the exact same seed.
[13:28.620 --> 13:31.220]  Whereas the unreliability of breeding
[13:31.220 --> 13:33.340]  through those F generations becomes like,
[13:33.340 --> 13:36.300]  well, it might be the same as last time.
[13:36.300 --> 13:37.220]  It might not.
[13:38.940 --> 13:40.580]  It's never a good plan.
[13:40.580 --> 13:44.180]  I take, I go F1, or if I want a little excitement,
[13:44.700 --> 13:45.700]  I'll go F2.
[13:45.700 --> 13:50.300]  But basically I do all my breeding with females.
[13:50.300 --> 13:54.460]  I did last year, my first shot at breeding with males
[13:54.460 --> 13:56.340]  only because I was sifting through
[13:56.340 --> 13:58.740]  some other people's regular seed
[13:58.740 --> 14:01.860]  and found a male in there that was the loudest male
[14:01.860 --> 14:03.460]  I've ever smelt in my life.
[14:03.460 --> 14:06.260]  It was like, you walk by it and it walks over
[14:06.260 --> 14:08.140]  and slaps you in the face.
[14:08.140 --> 14:10.540]  And so that was, so I go, you know what?
[14:10.540 --> 14:12.220]  I don't usually do this,
[14:12.220 --> 14:14.700]  but I separated about six of the girls
[14:14.700 --> 14:16.620]  that I know what they are.
[14:16.620 --> 14:18.700]  And I threw that male on them just to see
[14:18.700 --> 14:20.820]  because I have never seen anything louder.
[14:20.820 --> 14:24.780]  But do you breed with males and females all the time,
[14:24.780 --> 14:27.900]  Riggs, or do you go with the female to female?
[14:27.900 --> 14:30.540]  A hundred percent female.
[14:30.540 --> 14:31.380]  Yeah.
[14:31.380 --> 14:32.460]  Here's the reason.
[14:33.540 --> 14:37.180]  I think it's almost one of the more comical things
[14:37.180 --> 14:39.340]  you'll see in the cannabis world
[14:39.340 --> 14:41.340]  is when you see people showing a picture
[14:41.380 --> 14:44.860]  of a male plant and underneath they have a caption about,
[14:44.860 --> 14:48.180]  this is my stud male and he's just amazing.
[14:48.180 --> 14:49.700]  Look at how amazing he is.
[14:51.020 --> 14:52.620]  You don't know shit, bro.
[14:54.500 --> 14:56.700]  Because this is just a male plant
[14:56.700 --> 14:58.860]  that it has no female qualities
[14:58.860 --> 15:01.060]  from which you could judge what kind of daughters
[15:01.060 --> 15:01.980]  he would create.
[15:01.980 --> 15:03.940]  And don't forget, we aren't interested
[15:03.940 --> 15:05.180]  in growing more males.
[15:05.180 --> 15:06.780]  We're only interested in the females.
[15:06.780 --> 15:08.660]  They're the ones you get the weed from.
[15:08.660 --> 15:10.180]  You don't smoke males.
[15:10.220 --> 15:13.700]  So looking at a male and trying to claim like,
[15:13.700 --> 15:17.020]  oh, well this one is gonna be a great breeding parent.
[15:17.020 --> 15:19.740]  You don't know that until he's been bred to a female
[15:19.740 --> 15:22.380]  or several females and you see what the result
[15:22.380 --> 15:26.460]  of what this male brings to the table.
[15:27.540 --> 15:30.740]  And whereas when you're looking at two females,
[15:30.740 --> 15:34.060]  you can see their female qualities in both parents
[15:34.060 --> 15:37.420]  and you have a much more predictable outcome
[15:37.420 --> 15:39.020]  in the breeding because you can see
[15:39.060 --> 15:42.380]  what female traits are gonna be brought into the progeny.
[15:42.380 --> 15:44.460]  And they're all gonna be female seeds too
[15:44.460 --> 15:47.620]  because we're talking about breeding XX to XX.
[15:47.620 --> 15:50.140]  There's no Y chromosome, so there won't be any males.
[15:50.140 --> 15:52.020]  It's gonna all be female.
[15:52.020 --> 15:54.900]  And then the caveat there is that be careful
[15:54.900 --> 15:56.700]  that you don't breed with any hermaphrodites.
[15:56.700 --> 15:59.860]  So I always vet my females,
[15:59.860 --> 16:01.820]  make sure that they aren't hermes
[16:01.820 --> 16:05.220]  and then you reverse one and pollinate another.
[16:05.220 --> 16:07.780]  And this is how you get fem seed.
[16:08.660 --> 16:11.580]  I agree with you 1000%.
[16:11.580 --> 16:14.100]  It's like, if you breed with a male,
[16:14.100 --> 16:18.460]  like you said, you have to run it out for so damn long
[16:18.460 --> 16:21.140]  that by the time you find out that you
[16:21.140 --> 16:22.500]  and that male aren't getting along,
[16:22.500 --> 16:23.900]  you're in for a messy divorce.
[16:23.900 --> 16:26.660]  And that ruins a whole lot of batches of work
[16:26.660 --> 16:28.740]  that you just spun your tires on.
[16:28.740 --> 16:30.180]  It's a bad plan.
[16:30.180 --> 16:33.220]  Yeah, I mean, it seems obvious to somebody
[16:33.220 --> 16:35.580]  who has thought about it a little bit like I have,
[16:35.580 --> 16:40.580]  but when you have the thing with cannabis,
[16:40.620 --> 16:43.900]  we always have to remember is it's the female progeny
[16:43.900 --> 16:45.660]  that we're trying to grow.
[16:45.660 --> 16:48.540]  We don't care about growing males.
[16:48.540 --> 16:50.420]  We want female qualities.
[16:50.420 --> 16:52.460]  And when you're breeding with a male,
[16:52.460 --> 16:55.500]  you're essentially putting 50% of the genetics
[16:55.500 --> 16:59.140]  on a lottery ticket that you have no idea
[16:59.140 --> 17:01.940]  what that guy is going to do to the progeny.
[17:01.940 --> 17:05.180]  What female qualities will this male bring
[17:05.780 --> 17:07.380]  into that union?
[17:07.380 --> 17:09.700]  There are some hints you can think about,
[17:09.700 --> 17:12.700]  well, what were the qualities of this females
[17:12.700 --> 17:14.500]  that came from the same batch of seeds
[17:14.500 --> 17:15.620]  that the male came from,
[17:15.620 --> 17:18.660]  or even the mother of the male or something,
[17:18.660 --> 17:20.700]  but still it's a lot of guesswork
[17:20.700 --> 17:24.060]  and you're gonna end up with seeds that are 50% male,
[17:24.060 --> 17:26.700]  50% female, you don't want that.
[17:26.700 --> 17:30.020]  Ideally, we want pure female seed.
[17:30.020 --> 17:32.540]  And in my opinion,
[17:32.580 --> 17:35.300]  you're gonna get a much more consistent,
[17:35.300 --> 17:37.300]  much more predictable, as I say,
[17:37.300 --> 17:39.180]  result from breeding two females
[17:39.180 --> 17:42.260]  where you can actually see what the contributions,
[17:43.220 --> 17:46.140]  what female traits are coming from both sides
[17:46.140 --> 17:49.060]  and then will come together in your outcome.
[17:50.900 --> 17:52.540]  The odd time I'll go back,
[17:52.540 --> 17:57.540]  let's say if I do a nice F1 cross two things together
[17:58.140 --> 18:01.620]  and it makes a stunning plant for some reason or another,
[18:01.660 --> 18:06.140]  I want a little bit more of one of its parents, right?
[18:06.140 --> 18:10.260]  And so I'll do a BX and then see what it does.
[18:11.940 --> 18:13.220]  Absolutely.
[18:13.220 --> 18:15.020]  And that whole BXing process
[18:15.020 --> 18:17.380]  basically how Cinderella 99 was created,
[18:17.380 --> 18:19.780]  it's just a back cross through three generations.
[18:19.780 --> 18:23.860]  So you're going from the first one being the 50%,
[18:23.860 --> 18:27.300]  the 75% and then the 88%
[18:27.300 --> 18:30.060]  and then finally it'll give you the 94%,
[18:30.060 --> 18:31.540]  which would then be,
[18:31.540 --> 18:35.100]  that's the level where, okay, now you have C99.
[18:35.100 --> 18:40.100]  So yeah, back crossing and using plants
[18:40.420 --> 18:44.500]  that were saved in stasis and veg state
[18:44.500 --> 18:47.580]  for their future breeding.
[18:47.580 --> 18:48.780]  That's the way to go.
[18:49.940 --> 18:53.820]  With artificial lighting, we can do that.
[18:53.820 --> 18:56.740]  And the only reason Mendel or any of these breeders
[18:56.740 --> 19:00.100]  from a couple of hundred years ago did the F numbers
[19:00.100 --> 19:03.740]  was they had no indoor lighting to keep the plants alive.
[19:03.740 --> 19:05.220]  They're gonna die at the end of the season.
[19:05.220 --> 19:08.500]  So you gotta do what you gotta do.
[19:08.500 --> 19:13.500]  But to continue a practice that was forced upon people
[19:13.580 --> 19:16.900]  because of a lack of technology at the time
[19:16.900 --> 19:18.780]  is certainly not something you wanna say,
[19:18.780 --> 19:20.980]  well, we should keep doing that.
[19:20.980 --> 19:23.620]  Because, well, we have technology
[19:23.620 --> 19:25.740]  that allows us to not have to do that anymore.
[19:25.740 --> 19:27.780]  Why would we wanna go back and do that?
[19:29.780 --> 19:33.140]  How do you mine for new genetics?
[19:33.140 --> 19:37.100]  I hunt genetics or I buy packs of seeds from everywhere
[19:37.100 --> 19:39.140]  and I'll run through them.
[19:39.140 --> 19:41.380]  And if I see something that I like,
[19:41.380 --> 19:43.860]  what I'll do is I will self that,
[19:43.860 --> 19:46.660]  I'll make a bunch of them and then grow like 150.
[19:46.660 --> 19:48.300]  That's my magic number, right?
[19:48.300 --> 19:51.940]  And I look at what's under the hood of that genetic overall.
[19:51.940 --> 19:53.940]  So I see a little of the stuff that they missed
[19:53.940 --> 19:55.260]  in their selection.
[19:55.260 --> 19:57.620]  And then I'll take something out of that
[19:57.620 --> 20:00.100]  and then work it into something that I know
[20:01.780 --> 20:03.660]  because I know what that other one's got.
[20:03.660 --> 20:05.700]  And then I'll just take something that I know
[20:05.700 --> 20:08.540]  and make a right-hand turn and drive to Vegas
[20:08.540 --> 20:09.980]  or something with that cross.
[20:09.980 --> 20:13.180]  How do you hunt out your new hot shit?
[20:14.500 --> 20:18.540]  Generally, I just, in the last couple of years,
[20:18.540 --> 20:22.540]  there've been like some hot clones that are on the,
[20:22.540 --> 20:25.820]  people are talking about whatever it is.
[20:25.820 --> 20:30.340]  And I'll get the cut, I'll grow it, I'll flower it out,
[20:30.340 --> 20:31.820]  I'll smoke it.
[20:31.820 --> 20:34.320]  That's my vetting process right there.
[20:35.240 --> 20:38.060]  And then if it turns out to be something
[20:38.060 --> 20:39.180]  of a high enough quality,
[20:39.180 --> 20:41.660]  then we breed it with something that we have
[20:41.660 --> 20:44.180]  or do an S1, those kinds of things.
[20:44.180 --> 20:49.180]  But I don't have the time, space, energy
[20:49.220 --> 20:51.980]  to chase down hundreds of plants
[20:51.980 --> 20:55.180]  that I grew from regular seeds and eliminate males.
[20:59.780 --> 21:01.740]  I don't think that that's practical.
[21:01.740 --> 21:04.300]  And I think that it's always been that way
[21:05.760 --> 21:08.060]  for cannabis breeders is during prohibition
[21:08.060 --> 21:09.260]  when I was coming up.
[21:10.400 --> 21:13.620]  Nobody had the kind of legal space,
[21:13.620 --> 21:15.580]  obviously it wasn't legal at all.
[21:15.580 --> 21:19.160]  And so the numbers of plants that breeders could work from
[21:20.000 --> 21:20.920]  were smaller.
[21:20.920 --> 21:24.900]  And so therefore, they didn't have the ability
[21:24.900 --> 21:28.880]  to test a huge number of plants to figure out
[21:28.880 --> 21:30.720]  the kinds of things that you're talking about.
[21:30.720 --> 21:34.240]  So it's a luxury now that you can do that really.
[21:34.240 --> 21:37.920]  Yeah, for me, I was working for an LP.
[21:37.920 --> 21:41.400]  And so I was able to do it on my own, at my own grow
[21:41.400 --> 21:44.200]  and then grow out huge populations at an LP
[21:44.200 --> 21:46.920]  where they, two thirds of what they grow now
[21:46.920 --> 21:49.160]  is stuff that I bred them in house.
[21:49.160 --> 21:52.200]  So I've been really, really blessed to have access
[21:52.200 --> 21:54.800]  to a lot of really, really old genetics.
[21:54.800 --> 21:56.940]  I have some stuff that goes back to a male
[21:56.940 --> 22:01.120]  that I got out of a tie stick in the mid 70s.
[22:01.120 --> 22:04.120]  So some really old stuff and I just kept it, right?
[22:04.120 --> 22:06.680]  I just kept it and grew it out every so often.
[22:06.680 --> 22:07.520]  So I have it.
[22:07.520 --> 22:10.920]  But if I never, ever hunted anybody else's genetics,
[22:10.920 --> 22:15.920]  I still would have more to do than is humanly possible.
[22:16.360 --> 22:17.200]  All right.
[22:17.200 --> 22:20.640]  Well, tell us about some new stuff that you're working on,
[22:20.640 --> 22:22.400]  some twists and turns.
[22:22.400 --> 22:24.800]  I noticed seeds are opening up in the US.
[22:24.800 --> 22:28.040]  So what's on the burner?
[22:28.040 --> 22:32.200]  Well, I've been intrigued by Capulators Mac1
[22:32.200 --> 22:34.320]  for the past three years.
[22:34.320 --> 22:37.080]  I went through an intense period for a year or two
[22:37.080 --> 22:39.880]  of trying to see what I could do with breeding it
[22:39.880 --> 22:42.520]  because I really love the qualities of the plant
[22:42.520 --> 22:44.360]  and the smoke that comes from it.
[22:44.400 --> 22:49.400]  And that being that it has a very positive upbeat high,
[22:51.240 --> 22:53.640]  which I always go for, obviously.
[22:53.640 --> 22:57.480]  And the other thing being that it was a big yielder.
[22:57.480 --> 23:00.600]  It had very dense buds, super frosty.
[23:00.600 --> 23:04.400]  In fact, I told people when I first saw a picture
[23:04.400 --> 23:07.800]  of that plant, I said, well, in like 20 years,
[23:07.800 --> 23:11.000]  I don't think I had seen a picture of any flower
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.200]  that I thought would really make me sit up and take notice.
[23:15.040 --> 23:17.240]  And I would sit up and say, gee, I'm interested in that.
[23:17.240 --> 23:18.560]  I wonder what that is.
[23:18.560 --> 23:19.720]  Let's know more about it.
[23:19.720 --> 23:23.280]  And when I saw Mac1, that was the first time
[23:23.280 --> 23:25.400]  in something like 20 years that I actually sat up
[23:25.400 --> 23:28.720]  and took notice and said, holy Christ, what the hell is that?
[23:28.720 --> 23:32.560]  But the twists and turns that make it an interesting story
[23:32.560 --> 23:36.760]  are the fact that it turns out it's either a polyploid
[23:36.760 --> 23:41.120]  or something is stopping it from breeding well.
[23:41.200 --> 23:44.960]  Rumors are true that if you try to breed with Mac1,
[23:44.960 --> 23:47.120]  you can try to pollinate the flower.
[23:47.120 --> 23:49.000]  It doesn't really pollinate.
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.060]  You can have a Mac1 flowering in a room
[23:52.060 --> 23:55.720]  where you've released pollen that has created thousands
[23:55.720 --> 23:57.440]  of seeds on the other plants.
[23:57.440 --> 24:00.040]  And the Mac1 will have maybe five seeds
[24:00.040 --> 24:02.640]  that actually got created on the whole plant.
[24:02.640 --> 24:06.960]  And it's just, it resists pollination and creating seeds.
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.320]  And then on top of that, most people found
[24:11.760 --> 24:12.880]  that when you did get a seed,
[24:12.880 --> 24:17.400]  when it grew into a twisted, deformed mutant of a plant,
[24:17.400 --> 24:19.400]  nowhere near the quality of the mother
[24:19.400 --> 24:21.520]  or not even approaching average quality,
[24:21.520 --> 24:23.280]  it usually was a complete bust.
[24:23.280 --> 24:25.480]  So that was my result too.
[24:25.480 --> 24:29.600]  When I first crossed Mac1, I tried it with the Genius,
[24:29.600 --> 24:33.680]  the sister of Princess that created Cinderella 99.
[24:33.680 --> 24:36.320]  Genius is the mother of all the Apollo line,
[24:36.560 --> 24:38.800]  Apollo 13, Apollo 11.
[24:38.800 --> 24:42.240]  And so it's usually a great breeding plant.
[24:42.240 --> 24:43.840]  And when I crossed it to the Mac,
[24:43.840 --> 24:47.680]  the outcome of the resulting plants
[24:47.680 --> 24:49.920]  was just twisted, deformed messes.
[24:49.920 --> 24:51.800]  And so I threw my hands up in the air.
[24:51.800 --> 24:54.080]  I said, geez, I don't know what to do.
[24:54.080 --> 24:56.120]  And then I tried crossing it to C99.
[24:56.120 --> 24:57.360]  I actually had a couple of plants
[24:57.360 --> 25:00.000]  that came out pretty nice from that,
[25:00.000 --> 25:01.600]  but there were so few of them.
[25:01.600 --> 25:04.940]  And I think I didn't take care enough
[25:04.940 --> 25:08.220]  to watch those few seeds and gave away a few
[25:08.220 --> 25:10.220]  and shared a cutting with somebody.
[25:10.220 --> 25:14.500]  And I just know that, well, it still isn't right.
[25:14.500 --> 25:18.060]  So really troublesome plant to breed with,
[25:18.060 --> 25:21.780]  even though its own qualities were super high.
[25:21.780 --> 25:25.820]  And so it's been in the back of my mind,
[25:25.820 --> 25:27.900]  I've been kicking around, how am I gonna work with this?
[25:27.900 --> 25:30.820]  I'd love to get those genes into something
[25:30.820 --> 25:33.700]  that I could release for Brothers Graham.
[25:33.700 --> 25:38.260]  And about six or eight months ago, maybe even a year ago,
[25:38.260 --> 25:43.260]  someone got me a cut called Cap Junkie.
[25:43.380 --> 25:45.860]  And you may know about this cutting.
[25:45.860 --> 25:48.980]  It grows into very much like a Mac
[25:49.860 --> 25:54.340]  with that same, the purplish bud tips
[25:54.340 --> 25:57.540]  and the super heavy resin production
[25:57.540 --> 26:00.860]  and that same intoxicating aroma.
[26:01.020 --> 26:04.020]  It really has a very unique aroma.
[26:04.020 --> 26:06.100]  That's another thing about it.
[26:06.100 --> 26:08.140]  It's just like, it ticks all the boxes,
[26:08.140 --> 26:10.020]  it's super, super plant.
[26:10.020 --> 26:13.920]  So anyway, this Cap Junkie is almost like
[26:13.920 --> 26:17.980]  somebody hybridized the Mac One,
[26:17.980 --> 26:19.700]  I guess it was with Cushmints
[26:19.700 --> 26:22.020]  and they got a great result from it.
[26:22.020 --> 26:24.460]  And the best thing about it is that
[26:24.460 --> 26:26.740]  it actually makes seeds when you pollinate it.
[26:26.740 --> 26:30.420]  So we're gonna be releasing around Christmas time.
[26:30.940 --> 26:35.940]  I've crossed that Cap Junkie to my Rosetta Stone.
[26:36.140 --> 26:38.540]  I believe that's gonna be released next month.
[26:38.540 --> 26:41.180]  And Rosetta Stone,
[26:41.180 --> 26:43.300]  for those who haven't already experienced that,
[26:43.300 --> 26:48.300]  it was 2018 High Times Top 10 strains created that year.
[26:49.260 --> 26:52.740]  We got an article in High Times
[26:52.740 --> 26:56.100]  and everything for that Rosetta Stone.
[26:56.100 --> 27:00.060]  So it's a great plant that it mimics the Jack Harer,
[27:00.700 --> 27:02.900]  but it's a bigger yielding and faster flowering
[27:02.900 --> 27:05.460]  and more consistent version of Jack Harer.
[27:05.460 --> 27:08.340]  So crossing that with this Cap Junkie,
[27:08.340 --> 27:11.380]  I really believe we're gonna have a winner there.
[27:11.380 --> 27:13.820]  And so those seeds are coming out soon.
[27:13.820 --> 27:18.740]  And that's kind of the way the story twisted.
[27:18.740 --> 27:21.060]  If you wanna breed with Mac One,
[27:21.060 --> 27:25.040]  I spent years trying and I learned the pitfalls
[27:25.040 --> 27:26.500]  of trying to breed with Mac One
[27:26.500 --> 27:29.200]  and then seeing where, okay,
[27:29.240 --> 27:32.560]  apparently Capulator worked with the seed junkie people
[27:32.560 --> 27:34.920]  and they put this thing together
[27:34.920 --> 27:37.080]  with Cushmints and alien cookies.
[27:37.080 --> 27:41.400]  And so now the end of the story is that
[27:41.400 --> 27:42.760]  I didn't do it myself.
[27:42.760 --> 27:43.600]  I wish I did.
[27:43.600 --> 27:46.500]  I was trying to create a hybrid from Mac One
[27:46.500 --> 27:48.620]  that I could use as a breeding plant
[27:48.620 --> 27:52.440]  that would carry those genes into something of my own.
[27:52.440 --> 27:57.120]  And it's the Cap Junkie cutting seems to be the one
[27:57.520 --> 27:59.240]  that's what I would have liked to create.
[27:59.240 --> 28:01.400]  When I got a cut of it and I tried,
[28:01.400 --> 28:04.200]  I said, geez, this is exactly what I've been trying to make.
[28:04.200 --> 28:06.240]  So I'm gonna start using that
[28:06.240 --> 28:08.500]  as one of our new breeding plants.
[28:08.500 --> 28:11.720]  We also have had great success with Gluey.
[28:11.720 --> 28:14.920]  It's similar to like a GG4,
[28:14.920 --> 28:18.040]  but it's not the official GG4 cut.
[28:18.040 --> 28:20.080]  So we call it Gluey.
[28:20.080 --> 28:24.160]  And we created Grim Glue from that.
[28:24.200 --> 28:27.720]  Must've been two years or more ago.
[28:27.720 --> 28:29.280]  And it's just taken off.
[28:29.280 --> 28:31.840]  It's a hugely popular strain.
[28:33.920 --> 28:35.920]  Well, we're still looking into the future.
[28:35.920 --> 28:38.320]  And it seems like lately I've had the opportunity
[28:38.320 --> 28:42.100]  to get a lot of elite cuts from folks that share with me.
[28:42.100 --> 28:44.340]  And so I've been trying different things
[28:44.340 --> 28:46.480]  and you'll see that my marketing team
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.120]  has been putting out very frequent updates on tester seeds
[28:50.120 --> 28:52.760]  that, oh, here's a new strain that we've just created.
[28:52.760 --> 28:54.640]  Help us test it.
[28:54.640 --> 28:59.640]  And so I'm excited because I was a one man show for so long
[29:00.480 --> 29:02.560]  and now being married to a beautiful
[29:02.560 --> 29:04.700]  and very capable young lady
[29:04.700 --> 29:08.500]  and having associates like Mark who promote
[29:08.500 --> 29:11.140]  and maintain parts of this business
[29:11.140 --> 29:14.280]  that I couldn't do everything myself.
[29:14.280 --> 29:16.160]  I can concentrate on what I do well,
[29:16.160 --> 29:19.280]  breeding and growing the plants and making the seeds.
[29:19.280 --> 29:22.160]  And so it's in a very exciting time for me
[29:22.600 --> 29:24.840]  because Mr. Soul, Brothers Grimm,
[29:24.840 --> 29:28.120]  and Brothers Grimm is just really starting to shine
[29:28.120 --> 29:31.200]  and come into a full maturation
[29:31.200 --> 29:33.040]  the way I'd always hoped it would.
[29:35.040 --> 29:38.480]  Running a seed company is not a one man show.
[29:38.480 --> 29:39.600]  You gotta have help.
[29:39.600 --> 29:41.560]  And I've got the right kind of help now.
[29:41.560 --> 29:43.400]  And I really feel good about everything.
[29:43.400 --> 29:46.320]  And super healthy, feel good.
[29:46.320 --> 29:48.480]  Back to playing guitar a couple of years ago.
[29:48.480 --> 29:51.640]  I started back up by taking 10 years off of playing guitar.
[29:52.160 --> 29:54.840]  And so this is a great time of life for me.
[29:54.840 --> 29:57.840]  I really feel like I'm living my best life right now.
[29:57.840 --> 30:00.680]  Yeah, I've done a lot of messing around with Mac too.
[30:01.760 --> 30:04.720]  Mac one as well, not Mac two.
[30:05.600 --> 30:09.640]  I love the flavor, the dankness, the back,
[30:09.640 --> 30:12.920]  on the exhale, how the depth of flavor
[30:12.920 --> 30:14.640]  that is in there is really nice.
[30:14.640 --> 30:18.760]  I've actually crossed it out over 200 different ways
[30:19.080 --> 30:24.040]  and have found, now I'm an expert on reversing Mac.
[30:24.040 --> 30:25.600]  I can reverse it, bang.
[30:25.600 --> 30:27.640]  Before it was like, this is hard to reverse.
[30:27.640 --> 30:29.760]  I can't grow nuts on this thing.
[30:29.760 --> 30:31.720]  But finally I figured out how to do it.
[30:31.720 --> 30:32.560]  Well, there's.
[30:33.480 --> 30:34.960]  Yeah, I use.
[30:34.960 --> 30:37.680]  If you don't mind, we can talk about that for a second
[30:37.680 --> 30:41.480]  because that's one of the areas of contention
[30:41.480 --> 30:45.040]  is the reversal sprays that are out there right now
[30:45.920 --> 30:47.080]  or mix your own.
[30:47.080 --> 30:48.440]  And people ask me that question
[30:49.120 --> 30:49.960]  all the time.
[30:49.960 --> 30:54.640]  And I think my pat answer is I'll take silver thiosulfate
[30:54.640 --> 30:57.200]  and I'll mix it up myself from the two chemicals
[30:57.200 --> 30:58.560]  and some distilled water.
[30:58.560 --> 31:00.560]  And you go through that process of making
[31:00.560 --> 31:03.360]  the stock solution and then diluting it.
[31:03.360 --> 31:06.960]  And it's usually pretty reliable and it works.
[31:06.960 --> 31:09.520]  But again, the Mac, I did not have
[31:09.520 --> 31:11.160]  a whole lot of success with that.
[31:13.160 --> 31:16.400]  The concentration is important.
[31:16.400 --> 31:17.760]  These are things that I found.
[31:18.080 --> 31:19.720]  Not to say that I understand completely
[31:19.720 --> 31:21.200]  because I sure don't.
[31:21.200 --> 31:24.240]  I'm wishing that I could get a better handle on
[31:24.240 --> 31:27.240]  the concentration that you initially spray with
[31:27.240 --> 31:30.200]  and how many times to repeat the spraying
[31:30.200 --> 31:33.520]  until you feel that, okay, it's gonna work now.
[31:33.520 --> 31:36.440]  Those all, they all seem to have a fat.
[31:36.440 --> 31:39.600]  They play a factor in the results
[31:39.600 --> 31:41.560]  and whether it's gonna work or not.
[31:41.560 --> 31:43.400]  There's also colloidal silver.
[31:43.400 --> 31:46.040]  Now I never used to use colloidal silver
[31:46.080 --> 31:49.840]  because you need too strong of a concentration
[31:49.840 --> 31:51.240]  compared to what's available.
[31:51.240 --> 31:53.080]  Like in a health food store, I think they're down
[31:53.080 --> 31:55.640]  like 20 ppm or 30 ppm.
[31:55.640 --> 31:58.040]  But it's gotta be 60 or greater.
[31:58.040 --> 32:02.400]  So I did find a couple years ago on Amazon,
[32:02.400 --> 32:05.280]  you can buy colloidal silver at higher ppm.
[32:05.280 --> 32:08.320]  So there's like a 240 ppm colloidal silver
[32:08.320 --> 32:10.200]  available on Amazon somewhere.
[32:10.200 --> 32:14.720]  So I bought that, diluted it to 60 ppm,
[32:14.720 --> 32:17.280]  sprayed like the first week of flowering
[32:17.280 --> 32:20.440]  and lo and behold got beautiful pollen production
[32:20.440 --> 32:21.280]  from the plants.
[32:21.280 --> 32:25.480]  So I've now had good success with both colloidal silver
[32:25.480 --> 32:27.080]  and STS.
[32:27.080 --> 32:30.920]  And then there's a guy who's been out there since the 90s.
[32:30.920 --> 32:33.440]  In fact, he was one of the guys who used to be on
[32:33.440 --> 32:34.760]  the groups that we were in.
[32:34.760 --> 32:38.040]  And so I know him and love him in a certain way.
[32:38.040 --> 32:39.480]  And he's a mentor of mine.
[32:39.480 --> 32:44.480]  I remember AB Hybrid is his handle that he used to go by
[32:44.680 --> 32:49.680]  and he makes a spray now called Elite by Elite, E-X-E.
[32:49.680 --> 32:53.040]  And that stuff works with one application
[32:53.040 --> 32:55.360]  at the beginning of the first day flowering
[32:55.360 --> 32:57.280]  and you just don't touch it after that.
[32:57.280 --> 32:59.320]  And it'll make male flowers on the plant
[32:59.320 --> 33:01.440]  with one application.
[33:01.440 --> 33:04.560]  It's got some differences.
[33:04.560 --> 33:05.880]  It's not the same chemicals.
[33:05.880 --> 33:07.280]  He keeps that secret.
[33:07.280 --> 33:10.920]  It's a trade secret of his or his proprietary information.
[33:10.920 --> 33:12.960]  It's his company and he sells his spray.
[33:12.960 --> 33:14.480]  So God bless him.
[33:14.480 --> 33:17.840]  I would say, hey, don't give away the store.
[33:17.840 --> 33:19.160]  I understand that.
[33:19.160 --> 33:24.160]  But at the same time, I had good and bad luck with it.
[33:25.040 --> 33:27.840]  I've had some where the plant responded perfectly.
[33:27.840 --> 33:31.640]  I've had some where the plant didn't respond.
[33:31.640 --> 33:36.160]  So I still feel like we should probably throw an arm
[33:36.160 --> 33:38.920]  over each other's shoulder and talk a little bit,
[33:38.920 --> 33:39.880]  like go into a huddle.
[33:39.880 --> 33:41.240]  What works for you, brother?
[33:41.240 --> 33:42.080]  I don't know.
[33:42.080 --> 33:42.920]  I don't know what I've done
[33:42.920 --> 33:44.640]  and the things that do and don't work.
[33:44.640 --> 33:46.120]  So tell me a little bit.
[33:46.120 --> 33:49.200]  I always keep a backup, right?
[33:49.200 --> 33:52.680]  I'm a guy who I never start anything without a plan.
[33:52.680 --> 33:54.360]  And so if I'm gonna reverse,
[33:54.360 --> 33:56.640]  if I got any breeding project,
[33:56.640 --> 34:00.920]  I'm reversing two of whatever or 20 of whatever
[34:00.920 --> 34:02.720]  so that I have enough
[34:02.720 --> 34:06.280]  and I'm reversing a whole separate cultivar
[34:06.280 --> 34:11.280]  probably a week earlier in case something doesn't work,
[34:11.480 --> 34:13.080]  I can go one of two ways.
[34:13.080 --> 34:15.440]  So I always keep myself options
[34:15.440 --> 34:18.680]  and I can't get anything to reverse reliably
[34:18.680 --> 34:22.400]  with colloidal silver.
[34:22.400 --> 34:25.040]  I use STS always.
[34:25.040 --> 34:28.280]  The only difference is from cultivar to cultivar,
[34:28.280 --> 34:29.120]  it's different.
[34:29.120 --> 34:31.840]  Like if you're gonna reverse something like a Mexican
[34:31.840 --> 34:33.680]  or something that's like that
[34:33.680 --> 34:36.600]  with these seven to nine leaf finger fans,
[34:36.600 --> 34:40.960]  you know, maximum nine, you need less.
[34:41.640 --> 34:43.440]  Cherry pie reverse is easy, different stuff.
[34:43.440 --> 34:45.400]  But if you're gonna reverse something like the Mac
[34:45.400 --> 34:48.800]  or Runtz or something OG,
[34:48.800 --> 34:53.520]  then you need a little stronger solution.
[34:53.520 --> 34:56.480]  And it's very, very important on the timing.
[34:56.480 --> 34:59.280]  Like I can do one and done on some.
[34:59.280 --> 35:02.880]  I just hit it like a couple of days before I flipped the
[35:02.880 --> 35:05.280]  flower and just hit it really strong,
[35:05.280 --> 35:07.040]  burns a few leaves and it's done.
[35:07.080 --> 35:09.280]  The other ones I have to do, you know,
[35:09.280 --> 35:12.280]  five separate applications and you have to make sure
[35:12.280 --> 35:14.200]  that you do it during the dark.
[35:14.200 --> 35:15.920]  It's gotta be done during the dark.
[35:15.920 --> 35:18.600]  So it's got at least eight hours of darkness.
[35:18.600 --> 35:21.320]  And then, you know, you're okay.
[35:21.320 --> 35:23.640]  But it's very much cultivar specific.
[35:23.640 --> 35:27.000]  I've found some things I can spray STS
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  within a fucking month of stuff.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.920]  And I can reverse branches on a non-target
[35:31.920 --> 35:34.400]  just by a little over spray one time.
[35:34.400 --> 35:35.920]  Wow. That's surprising.
[35:35.920 --> 35:39.360]  What's your concentration and parts per million
[35:39.360 --> 35:40.200]  when you do it?
[35:40.200 --> 35:43.080]  I don't do a concentrate solution.
[35:43.080 --> 35:48.080]  What I do is I go straight to the final product,
[35:48.640 --> 35:51.880]  and I mix it probably three times as strong
[35:51.880 --> 35:53.720]  or two times as strong as what you would.
[35:53.720 --> 35:55.400]  So I only spray it three times.
[35:55.400 --> 35:58.400]  Once a week before, once the day of flip
[35:58.400 --> 35:59.440]  and once a week after,
[35:59.440 --> 36:01.880]  and then you just walk away and it nuts up or it doesn't.
[36:01.880 --> 36:04.760]  And sometimes, because if you spray too often,
[36:04.760 --> 36:06.760]  then you'll get them to nut up completely,
[36:06.760 --> 36:10.760]  bottom to top, everywhere, but you won't get any pollen.
[36:10.760 --> 36:13.840]  Yeah, because the female clusters
[36:13.840 --> 36:15.800]  are packing those little male flowers
[36:15.800 --> 36:16.680]  so close to each other.
[36:16.680 --> 36:18.800]  They don't have to have this space to open up
[36:18.800 --> 36:22.820]  and let the salmon dangle and let out the pollen.
[36:22.820 --> 36:24.360]  But the other thing you mentioned,
[36:24.360 --> 36:27.560]  and I forgot to bring that up and make it more specific,
[36:27.560 --> 36:31.280]  is that the plant being sprayed to be reversed
[36:31.280 --> 36:34.160]  should always start flowering at least a week
[36:35.720 --> 36:38.760]  before the few intend for it to pollinate,
[36:38.760 --> 36:42.600]  or else if you try to start the male,
[36:42.600 --> 36:44.520]  we call it a pollen donor.
[36:44.520 --> 36:47.240]  If you start the pollen donor at the same day
[36:47.240 --> 36:49.400]  as the females are starting flowering,
[36:49.400 --> 36:51.600]  they're gonna be too far advanced
[36:51.600 --> 36:56.000]  and the pollen donor is behind lagging
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.680]  and not making pollen soon enough.
[36:58.680 --> 37:00.880]  So I always do at least a week
[37:01.840 --> 37:04.400]  and that AB hybrid guy says two weeks,
[37:04.400 --> 37:07.520]  spray two weeks before you're gonna start flowering
[37:07.520 --> 37:11.680]  the females and you start flowering your pollen donor,
[37:11.680 --> 37:14.780]  then that seems excessive, two weeks,
[37:14.780 --> 37:17.480]  but somewhere between a week and two weeks is right.
[37:17.480 --> 37:20.840]  And that the final thing that I would say though,
[37:20.840 --> 37:22.200]  here's the determining things,
[37:22.200 --> 37:24.560]  that if pollen is being produced
[37:24.840 --> 37:29.960]  and hitting the flowers on the 25th day
[37:29.960 --> 37:32.680]  of the females flowering cycle,
[37:32.680 --> 37:35.720]  then you're hitting it just about perfect.
[37:36.640 --> 37:40.480]  I like 23 days, but yeah, I'll actually,
[37:40.480 --> 37:45.480]  I start my males 20 days ahead of the females
[37:45.960 --> 37:48.720]  when I reverse them or whatever female it is
[37:48.720 --> 37:50.200]  that's gonna be the donor.
[37:50.200 --> 37:53.120]  I reverse her 20 days in advance.
[37:53.160 --> 37:54.000]  And so that-
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.200]  That's the longest I've ever heard of.
[37:56.200 --> 37:57.040]  Yeah.
[37:57.040 --> 37:59.680]  Yeah, I do long because I do it extra long
[37:59.680 --> 38:03.480]  because I like to hit my plants a little bit earlier,
[38:03.480 --> 38:07.720]  like right at about 20 to 23 days, something like that.
[38:07.720 --> 38:09.880]  And then, because if you hit them too late,
[38:09.880 --> 38:11.240]  they develop too many seeds,
[38:11.240 --> 38:14.120]  they don't get enough carbohydrate and they're too small.
[38:14.120 --> 38:16.360]  Yeah, we have a lot of duds,
[38:17.600 --> 38:21.200]  the ratio of good to duds seeds goes up.
[38:21.200 --> 38:23.560]  Yeah, so I like to keep it right at the sweet spot
[38:23.560 --> 38:26.520]  if I can, I don't want too big of seeds either
[38:26.520 --> 38:27.680]  because I've done that before
[38:27.680 --> 38:29.320]  where I've had these jumbo seeds,
[38:29.320 --> 38:30.880]  but then if you get too small ones,
[38:30.880 --> 38:31.960]  then they get helmet head.
[38:31.960 --> 38:34.680]  So what do you do?
[38:34.680 --> 38:37.040]  Here's the solution to the helmet head problem.
[38:37.040 --> 38:39.160]  I don't know if you knew this.
[38:39.160 --> 38:40.920]  You know, a seed when it opens up,
[38:40.920 --> 38:44.560]  it's kind of like a clam shell, right?
[38:44.560 --> 38:46.920]  And it has a hinge on one end, yeah.
[38:46.920 --> 38:50.920]  And then the taproot comes out of the open end, obviously.
[38:51.800 --> 38:55.120]  Most people assume because the roots coming out here,
[38:55.120 --> 38:57.120]  it ought to be pointed down.
[38:57.120 --> 39:00.600]  But what that does is now your clam shells
[39:00.600 --> 39:01.960]  is going up through the,
[39:01.960 --> 39:03.920]  being pushed up through the medium and-
[39:03.920 --> 39:05.760]  Pushing the helmet on the head.
[39:05.760 --> 39:07.280]  Yeah, keeping it closed.
[39:07.280 --> 39:08.960]  What you wanna do is you wanna plant the seed
[39:08.960 --> 39:10.840]  with the pointed end up
[39:10.840 --> 39:14.480]  and push it under the soil about a half an inch.
[39:14.480 --> 39:17.960]  And then what happens is that root will come up
[39:17.960 --> 39:20.040]  and it'll turn and make a U-turn
[39:20.040 --> 39:21.720]  and start growing down.
[39:21.720 --> 39:24.600]  And at the same time, pushing the seed up.
[39:24.600 --> 39:26.480]  And it's, think about this.
[39:26.480 --> 39:30.600]  The dirt is like pulling the seed open and it's shedding.
[39:30.600 --> 39:33.120]  And the plant always comes up with the cotyledon,
[39:33.120 --> 39:34.720]  no seed attached.
[39:34.720 --> 39:35.560]  Right.
[39:35.560 --> 39:37.200]  I've been doing that for a very long time.
[39:37.200 --> 39:40.240]  I always advise people, it might seem counterintuitive,
[39:41.560 --> 39:44.480]  but you gotta plant up, not down.
[39:44.480 --> 39:47.800]  And then you won't have seeds stuck to your little seedlings.
[39:47.800 --> 39:48.920]  I usually don't wait.
[39:48.920 --> 39:51.320]  I don't wait until it comes out.
[39:51.320 --> 39:53.440]  I'll just throw it in a cup of water.
[39:53.440 --> 39:56.240]  I do a little wash with hydrogen peroxide at first
[39:56.240 --> 39:58.160]  because I don't want any hitchhikers.
[39:58.160 --> 40:01.880]  And then just quick, quick, like 15 seconds.
[40:01.880 --> 40:04.320]  And then I just put it in water for 24 hours.
[40:04.320 --> 40:07.000]  And the next day, boom, it just goes right in the cup.
[40:08.040 --> 40:12.080]  A lot of times in 24 hours, I already got tap coming out
[40:12.080 --> 40:13.800]  but I don't worry about aiming it.
[40:13.800 --> 40:17.200]  I just put it a little less than a quarter inch down,
[40:17.200 --> 40:18.440]  maybe an eighth.
[40:18.440 --> 40:21.520]  And boom, they always come up.
[40:21.520 --> 40:24.120]  Yeah, quarter inch, half inch under the soil.
[40:24.120 --> 40:26.000]  And with the tip pointing up,
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.920]  you're gonna know you won't have any seeds
[40:27.920 --> 40:29.100]  stuck to your plants.
[40:29.100 --> 40:31.320]  I've seen people have them with a tap root,
[40:31.320 --> 40:33.480]  like an inch long and they're planting them,
[40:33.480 --> 40:36.120]  you know, with the, they're holding it from the helmet
[40:36.120 --> 40:38.440]  and the tap roots down and they're putting a little hole
[40:38.440 --> 40:39.380]  and putting it in there.
[40:39.380 --> 40:41.240]  It's like, I don't think it's a good plan
[40:41.240 --> 40:42.720]  to let them go that far.
[40:42.720 --> 40:43.880]  Yeah, I agree.
[40:43.880 --> 40:48.120]  The paper towel germination method
[40:48.120 --> 40:50.280]  that a lot of people use where they let the roots
[40:50.280 --> 40:53.200]  come out of the seeds way too much,
[40:53.200 --> 40:57.760]  that's so unnecessary and it just adds a probability
[40:57.760 --> 41:01.200]  that you're gonna destroy the plant by breaking its root
[41:01.200 --> 41:03.440]  when you're trying to plant it originally.
[41:03.440 --> 41:05.800]  I do what you mentioned is soak the seeds
[41:05.800 --> 41:09.680]  in distilled water overnight, give them like 24 hours soak.
[41:09.680 --> 41:12.320]  And if they don't float after that amount of time
[41:12.560 --> 41:14.360]  and they sink to the bottom,
[41:14.360 --> 41:16.120]  that's the seed that's gonna germinate.
[41:16.120 --> 41:18.240]  There's no reason to keep it in a paper towel,
[41:18.240 --> 41:20.200]  get it right into the medium
[41:20.200 --> 41:22.360]  and it's gonna grow and do beautifully.
[41:22.360 --> 41:23.240]  Exactly.
[41:23.240 --> 41:25.480]  Yeah, I've even got some,
[41:25.480 --> 41:27.940]  I've got a really, really, really long outdoor.
[41:27.940 --> 41:30.480]  I've been selecting for the longest outdoor
[41:30.480 --> 41:31.800]  I could possibly get.
[41:31.800 --> 41:34.520]  And I got about 130 day outdoor
[41:34.520 --> 41:38.020]  and I can plant it outside in the fall
[41:38.020 --> 41:40.800]  and then I can go back and it'll come up by itself.
[41:40.800 --> 41:44.000]  And it's minus 40 where I live, it's Edmonton.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.520]  And I can put where I clean seeds,
[41:46.520 --> 41:48.740]  I have a way of cleaning seeds.
[41:48.740 --> 41:53.520]  I've run seeds through almost a $20,000 seed cleaning,
[41:53.520 --> 41:55.820]  separating machine from Spain.
[41:55.820 --> 42:00.380]  But you know what I still use is a stainless steel bowl,
[42:00.380 --> 42:02.800]  that's a big bowl and a blow dryer.
[42:02.800 --> 42:06.800]  I can't get seeds any cleaner than the old fashioned way.
[42:06.800 --> 42:10.840]  Yeah, man, that hair dryer and the bowl,
[42:10.840 --> 42:12.400]  that's a good one.
[42:12.400 --> 42:14.720]  I even have to clean that once they come out
[42:14.720 --> 42:17.040]  of this real expensive seed separator,
[42:17.040 --> 42:19.560]  which breaks the buds and separates the seeds
[42:19.560 --> 42:21.040]  according to size and so forth.
[42:21.040 --> 42:22.600]  That still got so much crap in it,
[42:22.600 --> 42:25.280]  it's gotta go to the blow dryer every time.
[42:25.280 --> 42:27.960]  Yeah, that's to blow away the little dud seeds,
[42:27.960 --> 42:29.720]  the little white ones and stuff.
[42:29.720 --> 42:33.120]  Yep, the duds come out and any dust that comes out,
[42:33.680 --> 42:37.040]  I don't want any contaminant on that seed.
[42:37.040 --> 42:41.000]  If I could, I do a little UV treatment on them as well.
[42:41.920 --> 42:44.520]  You just don't want hitchhikers to go out.
[42:44.520 --> 42:48.600]  Yeah, you know, that little procedure,
[42:48.600 --> 42:51.040]  you're using the hydrogen peroxide to clean the seeds
[42:51.040 --> 42:52.160]  before you germinate them.
[42:52.160 --> 42:54.080]  I mean, everybody should do that.
[42:54.080 --> 42:56.960]  If we had to list our methodology, it'd be like,
[42:56.960 --> 43:01.000]  okay, get your seed, the ones that you plan to germinate,
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.680]  wash them in the hydrogen peroxide, towel dry them,
[43:04.680 --> 43:08.360]  and put them in a distilled water to soak overnight.
[43:08.360 --> 43:10.480]  If they don't float after 24 hours
[43:10.480 --> 43:12.080]  and they sink to the bottom of the cup,
[43:12.080 --> 43:14.840]  well, you know that's a good seed and it's gonna germinate,
[43:14.840 --> 43:17.920]  put it in a medium and get it growing and that's it, man.
[43:19.080 --> 43:21.120]  Keep it simple, stupid, you know.
[43:21.120 --> 43:22.120]  Yeah, definitely.
[43:22.120 --> 43:25.900]  A lot of home growers are having more and more success.
[43:25.900 --> 43:28.140]  I'm hearing all kinds of people showing me
[43:28.140 --> 43:30.760]  what they've grown and they're so happy about it.
[43:31.520 --> 43:32.640]  And I've seen some of it.
[43:32.640 --> 43:34.360]  These guys know what the heck they're doing.
[43:34.360 --> 43:37.840]  It's always a ball to send one of your seeds to somebody
[43:37.840 --> 43:40.480]  and you get a picture back of what they did
[43:40.480 --> 43:44.400]  and it just makes you proud, like a proud papa.
[43:45.560 --> 43:47.760]  Hey, you set me up beautifully for this one
[43:47.760 --> 43:51.000]  because we got a client called Simon's Cure
[43:51.000 --> 43:54.160]  in upstate New York, like Rochester, I believe he's in.
[43:54.160 --> 43:57.120]  He grows the shit out of our strains.
[43:57.120 --> 44:00.480]  And when he sends us pictures of what his output is,
[44:01.280 --> 44:03.640]  I can't get over it sometimes.
[44:03.640 --> 44:06.320]  I'm like, damn, you are really crushing out there,
[44:06.320 --> 44:07.820]  my friend.
[44:07.820 --> 44:11.000]  So I agree, it is a great feeling,
[44:12.960 --> 44:17.960]  very humbling and also rewarding to see like,
[44:18.680 --> 44:22.180]  wow, this is what I'm putting out there.
[44:22.180 --> 44:24.360]  This is the potential that if somebody really knows
[44:24.360 --> 44:26.680]  how to grow it, this is what they can do with it.
[44:26.680 --> 44:27.520]  Yeah, what do you think?
[44:27.520 --> 44:29.520]  He grows it better than me.
[44:30.360 --> 44:33.260]  Well, I don't know about that, but if you say so.
[44:34.680 --> 44:37.920]  What do you think is gonna happen about the seed market
[44:37.920 --> 44:40.840]  in the US since last year they said,
[44:40.840 --> 44:44.400]  hey, seeds are, you know, they're nothing.
[44:44.400 --> 44:48.560]  That's a great topic because I've always felt like,
[44:48.560 --> 44:53.560]  you know, the seed is special in the sense that it's hemp
[44:54.540 --> 44:58.000]  by definition, when they defined hemp in the,
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.880]  what was it, the Marijuana Tax Act or something like that.
[45:00.880 --> 45:02.400]  I'm probably wrong about that name,
[45:02.400 --> 45:05.080]  but you know, the DEA came out this year
[45:05.080 --> 45:07.000]  and I think it was February, right?
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.160]  And they said, we definitely define all cannabis seed
[45:11.160 --> 45:13.480]  as hemp, which makes sense.
[45:13.480 --> 45:14.840]  I love philosophy.
[45:14.840 --> 45:17.600]  You're similar age as myself, you probably do too.
[45:17.600 --> 45:21.040]  As we get older, we tend to gravitate toward philosophy.
[45:21.040 --> 45:26.040]  And I really like thinking about things like precedents,
[45:26.960 --> 45:30.880]  that, you know, have been set and what it would mean
[45:30.880 --> 45:33.480]  if you were to change something.
[45:33.480 --> 45:36.840]  Like for example, this whole thing about the seed being hemp
[45:36.840 --> 45:41.200]  it's based on what is hemp by definition,
[45:41.200 --> 45:46.200]  any part of the cannabis plant that has 0.3% THC or less.
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.280]  So a seed doesn't have any THC.
[45:50.280 --> 45:53.800]  It won't get you high, no matter how many seeds
[45:53.800 --> 45:55.280]  you try to burn and welcome.
[45:55.320 --> 45:56.880]  There's no THC in there.
[45:56.880 --> 46:00.920]  So a seed is hemp, whether it grows into a plant
[46:00.920 --> 46:04.640]  that eventually will make THC or not, right?
[46:04.640 --> 46:07.120]  And if we were to say, oh, well, you know,
[46:07.120 --> 46:11.400]  like say you wanna be draconian, heavy handed,
[46:11.400 --> 46:13.720]  law enforcement, you know, minded kind of people.
[46:13.720 --> 46:17.040]  Oh, we can't let people be selling seeds
[46:17.040 --> 46:20.160]  that are gonna later grow into a THC bearing plant.
[46:20.160 --> 46:23.160]  How do we tell the difference between them?
[46:23.160 --> 46:24.000]  You can't.
[46:24.120 --> 46:24.960]  You can't.
[46:24.960 --> 46:26.120]  You can't.
[46:26.120 --> 46:29.480]  And the other thing is if you define something,
[46:29.480 --> 46:31.800]  you know, if you had to say, oh, okay,
[46:31.800 --> 46:35.440]  well the seeds that grow into marijuana plants later,
[46:35.440 --> 46:37.120]  they're not hemp.
[46:37.120 --> 46:39.400]  Well, then you'd really have a problem
[46:39.400 --> 46:43.440]  because you're saying we are defining this entity
[46:43.440 --> 46:47.920]  by what it might one day be under certain conditions.
[46:47.920 --> 46:51.200]  You know, it's like, you can't define something
[46:51.200 --> 46:52.880]  by what it might one day be.
[46:52.880 --> 46:55.720]  You have to define it by what it is now, right?
[46:55.720 --> 47:00.040]  Otherwise we'd have to say all eggs are chickens, right?
[47:00.040 --> 47:03.040]  Well, this world is getting pretty jacked up
[47:03.040 --> 47:07.120]  with what people say things were at one time
[47:07.120 --> 47:08.920]  and then they can be something different.
[47:08.920 --> 47:13.040]  You know, it's a, I don't know about that, but yeah.
[47:13.040 --> 47:15.600]  It's a philosophical question.
[47:15.600 --> 47:18.760]  That's why, you know, it leaves one room
[47:18.760 --> 47:22.680]  to sort of ruminate and think about and debate with another.
[47:23.480 --> 47:25.360]  But my point is that can you name anything else
[47:25.360 --> 47:28.240]  on this planet that we define by what it might be
[47:28.240 --> 47:31.200]  in the future versus what it is now?
[47:31.200 --> 47:33.280]  Yeah, profits and cannabis.
[47:34.600 --> 47:36.240]  Profits and cannabis, yeah.
[47:37.160 --> 47:41.120]  Yeah, I mean, that's a businessman's problem right there.
[47:41.120 --> 47:44.800]  They're trying to calculate, well, if we run this business,
[47:45.680 --> 47:47.440]  what will our profits be?
[47:47.440 --> 47:50.360]  Can we support the loans that have been given us
[47:50.400 --> 47:53.000]  to get this business up and ground, blah, blah, blah,
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.280]  you know, business people think.
[47:55.280 --> 47:58.880]  And then when those margins can change so drastically
[47:58.880 --> 48:00.800]  as they, you know, we've seen happen,
[48:00.800 --> 48:03.360]  like especially in Oregon, right, in the last year.
[48:04.240 --> 48:05.680]  It's devastating, but.
[48:06.720 --> 48:07.600]  Tell me about it.
[48:07.600 --> 48:11.120]  I got tier two license down South
[48:11.120 --> 48:16.120]  and it's absolutely, Oregon is a train wreck.
[48:16.360 --> 48:17.560]  Yeah, I feel for you.
[48:17.880 --> 48:18.720]  Yeah.
[48:18.720 --> 48:20.920]  It's not stable enough in the sense
[48:20.920 --> 48:25.840]  that with things changing from gradually getting
[48:25.840 --> 48:29.080]  more legalization and then availability
[48:29.080 --> 48:32.440]  and there's supply and demand, you know,
[48:32.440 --> 48:35.480]  as all the markets run on,
[48:35.480 --> 48:39.520]  it's a wild ride for those LPs out there.
[48:39.520 --> 48:41.800]  I'm much happier being a breeder.
[48:41.800 --> 48:42.960]  Yeah, me too.
[48:43.120 --> 48:48.120]  Hey, what do you, have you had a chance to run Magnum Opus?
[48:48.840 --> 48:49.680]  I have not.
[48:49.680 --> 48:54.160]  Those are from the fancy aficionado company.
[48:54.160 --> 48:56.280]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:56.280 --> 49:00.640]  Yeah, I have a good relationship with those folks.
[49:00.640 --> 49:02.080]  I like them and they like me
[49:02.080 --> 49:04.240]  and we've met at some events and things,
[49:04.240 --> 49:06.280]  but you know, I don't really have a lot of experience
[49:06.280 --> 49:09.600]  growing their stuff because my reputation is
[49:09.600 --> 49:12.600]  I've always kept a fairly tight gene pool
[49:13.240 --> 49:14.720]  and I mostly work within that.
[49:14.720 --> 49:16.640]  And it's only in the last year or two
[49:16.640 --> 49:17.680]  that I've started to say,
[49:17.680 --> 49:20.080]  hey, let me have a look at this or that or the other thing.
[49:20.080 --> 49:20.920]  So-
[49:20.920 --> 49:23.680]  I like to grow everything.
[49:23.680 --> 49:25.400]  I've heard good things about it.
[49:25.400 --> 49:27.000]  If you get a chance to get them,
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.640]  get the Magnum Opus and also get Black Frost.
[49:30.640 --> 49:33.800]  And I've got a phenol of Black Frost
[49:33.800 --> 49:37.920]  that smells just like a cheap vinyl shower curtain.
[49:37.920 --> 49:40.080]  Like, you know how when you open up
[49:40.080 --> 49:41.960]  that new plastic shower curtain, it's like-
[49:42.320 --> 49:44.920]  I could picture myself in the hotel with it right now.
[49:44.920 --> 49:47.960]  That was a good description.
[49:47.960 --> 49:49.240]  Those would be the ones that I,
[49:49.240 --> 49:51.240]  if you get a chance to get them,
[49:51.240 --> 49:53.120]  I would give those things a roll.
[49:53.120 --> 49:55.080]  And there's one that I got from Exotic.
[49:55.080 --> 49:58.360]  Cause I do, so I run hundreds of different things.
[49:58.360 --> 50:02.440]  They had one called Red Delicious, which was wonderful.
[50:02.440 --> 50:03.880]  You should get that.
[50:03.880 --> 50:07.520]  I mean, just, it smells like you got a fresh apple
[50:07.520 --> 50:11.120]  right off the tree and you put it right up by your face.
[50:11.120 --> 50:12.520]  That's what it smells like.
[50:13.840 --> 50:16.760]  And it tested about 21, though we grew it out.
[50:16.760 --> 50:18.760]  It tested at about 21, but I thought,
[50:18.760 --> 50:22.720]  I thought, man, these are really stunning new little things.
[50:22.720 --> 50:26.520]  I guess I get, I probably get out too much with-
[50:26.520 --> 50:28.520]  It sounds like it.
[50:28.520 --> 50:29.360]  Yeah.
[50:29.360 --> 50:30.200]  Yeah.
[50:30.200 --> 50:31.020]  But you know-
[50:31.020 --> 50:32.160]  You're living a pretty active life, my friend.
[50:32.160 --> 50:33.480]  You're up in Canada, right?
[50:33.480 --> 50:34.320]  Yeah. Yeah.
[50:34.320 --> 50:35.160]  Edmonton area.
[50:35.160 --> 50:38.720]  Well, I work, I work about 200 lines a year.
[50:38.720 --> 50:42.480]  Like 200 separate definitive turns a year
[50:42.480 --> 50:43.960]  on something or other.
[50:43.960 --> 50:46.240]  And it's always going to something else.
[50:46.240 --> 50:50.280]  So, so I'm, I'm, I'm, what I call it is strip mining
[50:50.280 --> 50:53.120]  or I'm dynamite fishing other people's genetics
[50:53.120 --> 50:55.120]  to find out what they got in there.
[50:55.120 --> 50:55.960]  And that's-
[50:55.960 --> 50:56.800]  That's not easy to get.
[50:56.800 --> 50:58.240]  That's all new stuff.
[50:58.240 --> 51:03.160]  How do you find the folks are open and welcoming to you
[51:03.160 --> 51:06.320]  and come and see what we've got?
[51:06.320 --> 51:07.160]  Nobody does.
[51:07.160 --> 51:08.340]  I don't even ask.
[51:09.220 --> 51:10.380]  I just buy, buy packs of seeds.
[51:10.380 --> 51:12.900]  I take anybody who sends me seeds.
[51:12.900 --> 51:15.460]  I've been doing this for 49 years.
[51:15.460 --> 51:18.180]  So that's, if it didn't come in a bag
[51:18.180 --> 51:20.100]  or it wasn't free or I couldn't buy it.
[51:20.100 --> 51:24.940]  Like I have cherry pie from Amsterdam, like forever old
[51:24.940 --> 51:26.940]  but I have the original one when it came out
[51:26.940 --> 51:29.220]  and you probably, but I, I just kept them
[51:29.220 --> 51:32.180]  because I didn't have access and I had a bunch of kids born.
[51:32.180 --> 51:33.980]  And so I was going to be a dad
[51:33.980 --> 51:36.060]  and that's that my decision was made.
[51:36.060 --> 51:38.260]  So I just had to limp along for a lot of years
[51:39.080 --> 51:41.900]  but I kept a lot of old, old stuff alive.
[51:41.900 --> 51:44.700]  Yep. You said it sounds like you did a hell of a job of it.
[51:44.700 --> 51:47.340]  Man. You've been at this longer than myself
[51:47.340 --> 51:50.540]  which is a rare individual walk in this planet right now.
[51:50.540 --> 51:52.780]  It's been, I've been at it longer than I have.
[51:52.780 --> 51:55.300]  So I'm heading for the door.
[51:55.300 --> 51:56.140]  Thank you.
[51:56.140 --> 51:56.980]  Thank you.
[51:56.980 --> 51:59.980]  Hats off to you for Cindy 99.
[51:59.980 --> 52:01.900]  Cause that was a nice little plan.
[52:01.900 --> 52:02.740]  I'll tell you.
[52:02.740 --> 52:06.580]  I'll tell you what you can, Canadians were the first ones
[52:06.580 --> 52:10.060]  to get in, Canadians were my first fans.
[52:10.060 --> 52:12.060]  Cinderella 99.
[52:12.060 --> 52:15.860]  When, when I came back into the cannabis world again
[52:15.860 --> 52:19.620]  from having sat on the sidelines for a while, cause you know
[52:19.620 --> 52:21.860]  illegality prohibition, all that sort of thing.
[52:21.860 --> 52:23.540]  And I, I'm a nuclear engineer.
[52:23.540 --> 52:26.420]  I had a, you know, ability to make a living in another way.
[52:26.420 --> 52:28.940]  So I played it safe for a few years there
[52:28.940 --> 52:30.540]  but I was always on the sidelines
[52:30.540 --> 52:33.240]  and cheering for legalization to come.
[52:33.240 --> 52:36.260]  And so here it is.
[52:36.980 --> 52:40.340]  I got to Colorado in 2015
[52:40.340 --> 52:43.220]  and restarted Brothers Grimm at that point.
[52:43.220 --> 52:48.220]  But in the early days, remember having stairway Richard
[52:49.820 --> 52:53.660]  up there in Ontario, I believe he was the one
[52:53.660 --> 52:56.700]  who was the only distributor of Brothers Grimm seeds
[52:56.700 --> 52:58.620]  when we first opened.
[52:58.620 --> 52:59.460]  Right.
[52:59.460 --> 53:03.340]  The first, the first real Cindy 99 I smoke came out of BC.
[53:03.340 --> 53:04.380]  Yeah.
[53:04.380 --> 53:09.020]  So that's where our seeds were sent to the very first
[53:10.260 --> 53:11.980]  you know, issue.
[53:11.980 --> 53:13.500]  Well, I'm retiring.
[53:13.500 --> 53:15.580]  I'm retiring with the Canadians.
[53:15.580 --> 53:19.380]  Next year by, by the end of summer, I'm done.
[53:19.380 --> 53:21.060]  It's like, I get to retire.
[53:21.060 --> 53:22.420]  I don't know what I'm going to do.
[53:22.420 --> 53:24.360]  I'm, I'm already nervous about it.
[53:25.540 --> 53:29.700]  Well, there's a lot of options nowadays.
[53:29.700 --> 53:30.540]  Yeah.
[53:30.540 --> 53:32.180]  Grandkids, boy, I'll tell you.
[53:32.180 --> 53:34.460]  I really enjoy my grandkids.
[53:34.460 --> 53:37.540]  I enjoy it when they go home, but I love my grandkids.
[53:37.540 --> 53:38.380]  Yeah.
[53:38.380 --> 53:41.340]  That's, that's, I say there's people say
[53:41.340 --> 53:45.060]  that grandchildren are the reason you have kids.
[53:45.060 --> 53:45.900]  Yeah.
[53:45.900 --> 53:46.740]  Yeah.
[53:46.740 --> 53:47.560]  I don't know.
[53:47.560 --> 53:48.400]  Sex was the reason.
[53:48.400 --> 53:50.300]  It sounds like you have a hell of a family
[53:50.300 --> 53:51.640]  if you don't mind my asking.
[53:51.640 --> 53:52.480]  Yeah.
[53:52.480 --> 53:56.100]  We got a cost about four grand for around Christmas.
[53:56.100 --> 53:59.060]  So we got between my wife and myself,
[53:59.060 --> 54:03.060]  we got 11 kids and 19 grandkids.
[54:03.060 --> 54:03.900]  Wow.
[54:03.900 --> 54:08.500]  So it's a good one, but I, I'm going to be sad
[54:08.500 --> 54:11.520]  to not grow, grow so many turns, but I'm going to be glad.
[54:11.520 --> 54:13.820]  I was shucking seeds up until a half an hour
[54:13.820 --> 54:18.200]  before the show and I, I, I'm just too old, too old for this.
[54:18.200 --> 54:19.040]  Yeah.
[54:19.040 --> 54:21.700]  Well, like I said earlier, you know, you get good help
[54:21.700 --> 54:24.780]  and the right people and everything starts to be a bit more
[54:24.780 --> 54:25.620]  of a pleasure.
[54:25.620 --> 54:28.140]  It has been my experience recently.
[54:28.140 --> 54:32.260]  So I can advocate you, you get the right people
[54:32.260 --> 54:34.300]  around you there that can help out with things
[54:34.300 --> 54:36.140]  and you got to learn how to delegate.
[54:36.140 --> 54:37.660]  That's really hard for guys like us.
[54:37.660 --> 54:38.780]  I can hear it in your voice.
[54:38.780 --> 54:40.460]  You're kind of person probably,
[54:40.460 --> 54:42.660]  nobody else is going to do this as good as I can.
[54:42.660 --> 54:45.780]  You know, I better just like, and I can't farm this out.
[54:45.780 --> 54:46.620]  That's me.
[54:46.620 --> 54:49.460]  You and I met, I think it was in Las Vegas.
[54:49.460 --> 54:51.940]  It might've been in Colorado at some show.
[54:51.940 --> 54:54.100]  And, and, and, and you were up to your elbows
[54:54.100 --> 54:56.100]  in alligators because people weren't doing
[54:56.100 --> 54:57.020]  what they're supposed to.
[54:57.020 --> 54:59.940]  So yeah, you know, well and good how hard it is
[54:59.940 --> 55:02.180]  to get, get everything running smooth.
[55:02.180 --> 55:03.960]  Yeah, that's true.
[55:04.980 --> 55:08.140]  It's a good feeling when you get it right.
[55:08.140 --> 55:13.100]  And it's not also anything that you can say.
[55:13.100 --> 55:14.940]  Everything's always just going to stay this way.
[55:14.940 --> 55:16.700]  You always have to be prepared that, you know,
[55:16.700 --> 55:18.740]  the one constant life has changed.
[55:18.740 --> 55:21.600]  And so don't be surprised when, oh gee,
[55:21.600 --> 55:24.500]  here's some little blip comes on your radar.
[55:24.500 --> 55:25.620]  We got to fix that.
[55:25.620 --> 55:27.780]  And this, we never thought about that, but you know,
[55:27.780 --> 55:30.500]  we've grown so that this has to change
[55:30.500 --> 55:32.180]  or be done differently.
[55:33.320 --> 55:35.180]  Well, I've got, I've got about,
[55:35.180 --> 55:37.280]  I've got about 10 more minutes here.
[55:37.280 --> 55:39.140]  So we're going to get some questions.
[55:39.140 --> 55:42.660]  But I'll get your, I'll get your address
[55:42.660 --> 55:44.620]  and I will get you a couple of the ones
[55:44.620 --> 55:47.860]  that work the very best crosses with Mac.
[55:47.860 --> 55:51.180]  I have Mendo Blue Dream crossed to Mac one.
[55:51.180 --> 55:53.300]  And that was, that was the very best one
[55:53.300 --> 55:55.020]  that crossed with Mac one.
[55:55.540 --> 55:57.380]  It sounds like that would be a hell of a good combo.
[55:57.380 --> 55:58.220]  Yeah.
[55:58.220 --> 55:59.060]  Oh man.
[55:59.060 --> 56:00.500]  Is it a good combo?
[56:00.500 --> 56:01.500]  It is.
[56:01.500 --> 56:03.500]  It's like gotten so many crystals
[56:03.500 --> 56:06.540]  that there's nowhere for trichomes to grow out.
[56:06.540 --> 56:09.660]  They're so jam packed together around each other,
[56:09.660 --> 56:12.620]  but yet it has some of that same Mac funk, right?
[56:12.620 --> 56:15.940]  It's, and so, so it's, I'm, we're excited about it.
[56:15.940 --> 56:18.580]  Yeah. Well, be happy to try it.
[56:18.580 --> 56:19.780]  Yeah. I'll send it to you.
[56:19.780 --> 56:22.180]  You can grow it and maybe you can cross it to your Mac one
[56:22.180 --> 56:23.300]  or mess around with it.
[56:23.460 --> 56:25.260]  However you see, it's a free world
[56:25.260 --> 56:28.260]  and we didn't invent this, this, this strain.
[56:28.260 --> 56:29.660]  So if I give out the seeds,
[56:29.660 --> 56:32.500]  everybody can do whatever they want with them.
[56:32.500 --> 56:34.660]  Yeah. It'd be kind of hard to tell people they couldn't.
[56:34.660 --> 56:36.100]  That's how I always look at it.
[56:36.100 --> 56:37.980]  You know, people will write me sometimes and say,
[56:37.980 --> 56:40.740]  do you mind if I use one of your plants
[56:40.740 --> 56:42.780]  to cross with something else and make seed?
[56:42.780 --> 56:45.420]  And I'm like, no, of course I don't mind.
[56:45.420 --> 56:47.780]  I mean, I wouldn't sold you the seeds
[56:47.780 --> 56:50.380]  if I had thought that you were had any kind of restriction
[56:50.380 --> 56:51.940]  on their use.
[56:51.980 --> 56:55.100]  Cause that'd be a hell of a hard thing to enforce.
[56:55.100 --> 56:56.580]  You know, you'd never.
[56:56.580 --> 56:58.980]  You'd be fooling yourself if you.
[56:58.980 --> 57:00.860]  Yeah. Let me tell you a little secret
[57:00.860 --> 57:02.660]  before we go to the questions.
[57:02.660 --> 57:06.380]  I, I worked in commercial nursery production
[57:06.380 --> 57:07.940]  and vegetable seeds.
[57:07.940 --> 57:10.820]  And so if you buy a tomato,
[57:10.820 --> 57:14.780]  like I worked eight years on one tomato seed, you know,
[57:14.780 --> 57:16.620]  that's a long time to catch a paycheck
[57:16.620 --> 57:18.140]  to work on a tomato seed,
[57:18.140 --> 57:21.700]  but they make all their tomatoes from cuttings.
[57:22.460 --> 57:23.340]  They're F1.
[57:23.340 --> 57:27.220]  So they make their seeds by crossing two together,
[57:27.220 --> 57:29.100]  but they have a trick.
[57:29.100 --> 57:32.780]  We would actually put hitchhiking genetics
[57:32.780 --> 57:36.700]  on both of the parents to make those F1s.
[57:36.700 --> 57:39.500]  So that the first year that they hatched it,
[57:39.500 --> 57:40.580]  it would grow perfect.
[57:40.580 --> 57:43.060]  But if it made more seed from itself,
[57:43.060 --> 57:44.900]  it turned out to be a train wreck.
[57:44.900 --> 57:46.900]  It had all kinds of weird stuff in it.
[57:46.900 --> 57:50.500]  So I've been able to actually do that with cannabis.
[57:50.500 --> 57:52.220]  Yeah, I bet you can.
[57:52.220 --> 57:53.060]  You can.
[57:53.060 --> 57:54.500]  And so I was just,
[57:54.500 --> 57:56.020]  but there really is no way for us
[57:56.020 --> 57:58.500]  to protect our intellectual property
[57:58.500 --> 58:00.940]  aside from just owning the two mothers
[58:00.940 --> 58:03.500]  that made the family, right?
[58:03.500 --> 58:05.340]  And that's the best way.
[58:05.340 --> 58:07.900]  And then if someone's astute enough
[58:07.900 --> 58:10.780]  to sort that back out out of a self population,
[58:10.780 --> 58:11.740]  you know, God bless them.
[58:11.740 --> 58:13.380]  They got that talent.
[58:13.380 --> 58:15.020]  Cause it ain't that easy.
[58:15.020 --> 58:18.780]  Here's another philosophical thing
[58:19.580 --> 58:21.260]  considering that point.
[58:21.260 --> 58:24.740]  What if someone did try to copy,
[58:24.740 --> 58:27.100]  you know, one of your seed lines?
[58:27.100 --> 58:31.740]  To me, when you've already been the established authority
[58:31.740 --> 58:34.100]  that created a certain strain,
[58:34.100 --> 58:37.140]  if somebody sees somebody else copying that and saying,
[58:37.140 --> 58:39.140]  hey, we're making them seeds the same, you know,
[58:39.140 --> 58:41.660]  or whatever, to me,
[58:41.660 --> 58:44.820]  it'd be like proposing to someone,
[58:45.660 --> 58:49.060]  hey, you know, instead of going and seeing the Beatles
[58:49.060 --> 58:50.500]  at Shea Stadium,
[58:50.500 --> 58:53.460]  why don't we go down, you know, the theater district
[58:53.460 --> 58:56.540]  and we can see Beatlemania on Broadway.
[58:56.540 --> 58:58.860]  Be like, who the fuck would do that?
[58:58.860 --> 59:00.460]  You want the real thing, you know,
[59:00.460 --> 59:03.420]  especially if the two things are still both available,
[59:03.420 --> 59:05.340]  who's gonna buy a knockoff
[59:05.340 --> 59:07.740]  and try and save a couple of bucks on seeds
[59:07.740 --> 59:10.820]  where when you think about the bang for your buck
[59:10.820 --> 59:14.580]  with seeds is about the greatest bang for your buck
[59:15.340 --> 59:16.420]  that you can find in anything.
[59:16.420 --> 59:19.900]  Where else are you gonna get a perpetual money generator
[59:19.900 --> 59:21.420]  for a hundred bucks?
[59:21.420 --> 59:22.260]  Yeah.
[59:22.260 --> 59:24.020]  Go to the source.
[59:24.020 --> 59:25.420]  It's so much important.
[59:25.420 --> 59:28.780]  I was talking to Simon the other day from Serious Seeds
[59:28.780 --> 59:32.180]  and people knock him off all the time.
[59:32.180 --> 59:35.940]  You get AK-47 from everybody, but I'll tell you what,
[59:35.940 --> 59:38.500]  I've grown AK-47 from Simon's
[59:38.500 --> 59:40.540]  and that stuff is the real deal, so.
[59:40.540 --> 59:41.380]  Yeah, of course.
[59:41.380 --> 59:42.620]  He's the original breeder.
[59:42.620 --> 59:43.900]  That's what I'm saying is that
[59:43.940 --> 59:47.380]  I know Simon, he's a friend of Amet's
[59:47.380 --> 59:49.380]  who I deal with over in the UK.
[59:49.380 --> 59:53.460]  And so with him still making the seed,
[59:53.460 --> 59:56.020]  I would never want to get it from anybody else.
[59:56.020 --> 59:58.620]  And boy, that's got a hell of a reputation.
[59:58.620 --> 01:00:01.220]  It goes back a long way to the nineties, man.
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:02.060]  That's wonderful.
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.140]  I grew it last summer.
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.420]  I got a big jar of it just right over there.
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:09.820]  It's just hairy as heck and just, it's a good strain.
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:10.660]  No doubt.
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.100]  That's why it was good when it was good.
[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.900]  And it's still good.
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.220]  When are we going to meet up again?
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:18.420]  I'd sure like to see you in the future
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:21.620]  or maybe take a trip to Canada or come on down.
[01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:24.460]  Anytime you're in the Edmonton area, come by.
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:25.980]  We'll give you a show.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:28.180]  If not, we'll hook up for sure.
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:32.620]  But London, you got any questions for Mr. Soul?
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.700]  Yes, I have a couple here.
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.260]  So first question is you mentioned
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:37.980]  that you have some very old mothers
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.160]  that you still take and use for seeds.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:44.880]  Do you find that the yields decrease over time
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.880]  or that as you get to 30 or 20 year old plants
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.000]  that their yields and production goes down
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.160]  or do you find that they stay relatively consistent
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.600]  on the seed end?
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.120]  Well, as far as, you know, for breeding
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.320]  what's really important is the genes
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.760]  and that's never going to change.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.880]  So the same chromosomes are floating around
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.520]  inside those tissues, no matter how many years
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.840]  the plant's been growing.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.480]  So it'll always make the seeds the same.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.400]  Now your performance under the lights
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.080]  and how big will the buds get?
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:24.080]  And, you know, that usually doesn't change either
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:26.680]  unless it's some kind of a pathogen or, you know,
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.280]  the plant's suffering or didn't feed,
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.680]  it wasn't fed well enough or lit well enough
[01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.400]  or something in that cycle.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:38.080]  But you can always get it to be its old self again
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.960]  if it's healthy, you know.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:44.200]  So there's really not a genetic drift or, you know,
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:49.200]  a senescence over time that would destroy the plant.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.760]  These 25 and 30 year old cuts,
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.560]  I have one that's a big, huge stocky indica
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.960]  that's a 30 year old cut.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:04.960]  And that's a proprietary to Brothers Graham indica strain.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.880]  And that has every bit as much vigor and grows as big
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.920]  and healthy today as it ever did.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:17.400]  So it's a little bit perhaps individual dependent,
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:20.480]  you know, and also how well the health of the plant
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.600]  has been kept up.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.840]  And maybe it's possible to mess them up,
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.840]  but if you keep them healthy, there shouldn't be a problem.
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.760]  All right, next question is BK Pro asked,
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.560]  I can't pronounce your last name, Pro Audio.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.480]  No, it's I can, it's very easy, it's BK Pro Audio.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.600]  What's Mr. Soul token on?
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.320]  Oh, you know, we grew a couple of big plants
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:50.200]  outside the house just under the Colorado sunshine this year
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.000]  and one of them was our Jack hair.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.920]  And so I put, I think there's at least a dozen
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.440]  port size Mason jars upstairs
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.440]  and my assistant brought some down
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.280]  and had grinded up and put it in my little
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.840]  one hit bonger here.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.800]  And yeah, delicious, super frosty,
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.840]  nice uplifting energy high.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.680]  So yeah, that's Jack hair, pure Jack hair.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.420]  All right, next one.
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:27.860]  How did you, how did Mr. Soul come up with the idea
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.220]  for the Green Avenger?
[01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:31.660]  The Green Avenger?
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:36.660]  Well, you see, that's the name TGA from Subcool
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:40.540]  who has passed in the last couple of years now
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:41.620]  is an old friend of mine.
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:44.740]  And he was one of the members of the 77 club
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.100]  that we were on the message boards that I mentioned earlier
[01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.380]  in the interview today.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:55.380]  And so what I wanted to do as I came back into,
[01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:59.860]  opening Brothers Grimm in 2015 and Subcool had been kept,
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:03.380]  he had already had his seed company going for some time
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:09.020]  and sort of jumped into the legalized world
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.500]  earlier than I did.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:14.380]  And he gave me a leg up and some advice on the telephone
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:17.740]  and we reconnected after several years of not talking.
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:19.780]  And I had gone my own way
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:23.060]  and worked the straight life as an engineer.
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:27.820]  So the Green Avenger was meant to be a tribute to Subcool.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.460]  And a thank you and a tip for that.
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.660]  He always liked my genius cut
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:36.340]  and I had sent him some flour from that way back
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:42.420]  20 years ago and he wrote a story in his book
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:43.660]  about it and everything.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:48.660]  And so, long story I'm sure, but the point being,
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.620]  I created it as a tribute to Subcool
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:55.460]  and a thank you to Subcool for kind of giving me a wink
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:58.660]  and a nod and saying, yeah, man, the water is right.
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.340]  You can get back in the pool.
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.820]  So that was it.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.500]  And TGA was the name of his company.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.780]  So the Green Avenger is TGA, right?
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:10.860]  That's the answer.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.940]  And then last question for the day,
[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:18.780]  when did Missler still learn to do feminized breeding?
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.340]  I think you mentioned that you started off
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.620]  doing a lot more regular breeding.
[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.980]  So the feminized breeding came later?
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:29.980]  Yeah, this is absolutely in my second incarnation here.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:35.500]  When I came back in 2015, my intention was to continue
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.060]  breeding regulars as I always did,
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:43.060]  but I had pressure from the distributor in Europe.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.540]  I guess I was about to say the UK
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.420]  because he's in the UK, which is Europe.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:50.700]  But anyhow, long story.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:53.700]  What they were saying to me was,
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.580]  hey, we love that you're back.
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:06:00.580]  We love Brothers Grimm, but people want feminized seeds.
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:04.020]  And I said, hey, now I'm not really sure
[01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:06.500]  that's something I wanna do.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.380]  So let me research it.
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.460]  And I'm a scientist.
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.660]  I have a master's degree in nuclear engineering.
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.500]  And when you get to that level of education,
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.380]  you learn how to learn, essentially.
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:21.260]  So I went out and did research on genetics
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:23.140]  and breeding and hermaphrodites,
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:26.220]  and not only in plants, but in all organisms.
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:30.080]  And so what I learned in the end was it's possible to do it.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.620]  And it's possible to do it in a way
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.780]  where you won't have problems with hermaphrodites.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.500]  And so once I was assured of that,
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.660]  and I knew how to do that,
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:43.540]  and if I can elaborate for two seconds,
[01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:46.580]  I'll just say that the key to it was understanding
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:51.580]  that it's hormones that affect the gender change
[01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:56.700]  in an organism, not a chromosomal effect.
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:00.980]  In other words, we're all male or female
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:04.420]  based on being XX or XY chromosomes,
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:08.900]  the sex chromosome that determines whether you're a male
[01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:11.340]  or a female is either the X or the Y.
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:15.140]  So nothing changes that.
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:19.180]  But when a hermaphrodite is produced,
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:24.180]  it manifests itself through hormonal shifts,
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:27.100]  and they can be controlled,
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:31.740]  but some plants are hermaphrodites
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:36.340]  because stress will induce
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:39.180]  them to make male flowers on a female.
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:43.300]  Now, a plant that isn't a hermaphrodite can be stressed,
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:46.100]  and it won't ever make any male flowers.
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.620]  Those are the ones you wanna breed with.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.900]  But the catch 22 is, well, hey, you just said,
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.580]  the ones that don't make male flowers
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.980]  are the ones that you wanna use as a pollen donor.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:59.740]  How the fuck does that work?
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:03.980]  Well, just because the plant didn't respond to stress,
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:07.740]  it can still be made to make male flowers
[01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.060]  through hormonal induction.
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.260]  And that's what we do when we use this phrase
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:15.580]  like the colloidal silver or the silver thiosulfate.
[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.220]  And that's basically the formula is understanding
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:22.060]  that you gotta deal with non-hermaphroditic plants
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:26.380]  and then hormonally induce them to create pollen.
[01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:29.500]  And then you get a reliable feminized plant.
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:32.980]  So once I felt like, oh, now it's fully understood,
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:35.100]  I can do this without fear
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.780]  that I'm gonna ruin my reputation
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:38.460]  by making a bunch of hermies or something.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:43.500]  So that's the story of how I got into making feminized seed.
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:45.380]  Cool.
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:49.740]  I actually grow my seeds outdoors,
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:54.820]  but I bring them indoors and I test them with a big run
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:57.180]  just to make sure that I don't have any herm problems
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:01.140]  because often people say that seed produced outdoors
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.540]  can make herms.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.900]  Now, I found that there's a few strains
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:08.180]  that are really kind of on the herm wagon train
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:10.020]  and that's the cookie strains.
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.300]  You know, I've seen that.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:15.340]  It's you'll be growing it up and then you'll look down
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:17.860]  and you'll have these little Chinese lantern coming out
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:21.020]  right, you'll have one right there, right in the middle,
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:23.300]  down low, kind of on the main stock,
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.620]  just in a perfect spot to screw you up and you can't see it.
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:30.020]  So I kind of stay, I've got cookie, cookies is gone.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.580]  I have it in seed form, but it's gone.
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:34.300]  And I just don't mess with it.
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:38.300]  It grows these little 11 to 13 leaf finger fans
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.540]  that are just crazy to kind of keep a look at,
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:43.700]  but they will herm one out of, if you grow 500,
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.580]  you will get one herm out of that.
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.620]  See if you like.
[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:51.540]  It's not surprising, you know, that's the whole problem
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:54.740]  is we've always been trying to avoid creating
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:58.940]  more hermaphrodites in the creation of fem seed.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:03.900]  And the guys who started making fem seeds in the late 90s
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.300]  didn't really have the same understanding of it
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.540]  as I just described to you,
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:13.100]  where they thought that stressing a plant was okay.
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:17.940]  And that if they stress the female to make male flowers,
[01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:20.420]  that they'd be making fem seeds,
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:22.940]  but they kind of accepted and knew that
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:25.220]  it's also gonna make some herms,
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:27.940]  but there'll be, you know, mostly female.
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:29.540]  That's certainly not good enough.
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.420]  You know, you can't sell seed like that.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.820]  You're just creating a lot of problems for people.
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:37.300]  So there was a long period of time,
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:42.300]  I figured between 2000 and 2010,
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:46.860]  people were pretty pissed off about the fem seed
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:49.740]  being, you know, producer of hermaphrodites.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:52.020]  And the reason why that was happening
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.860]  is because they didn't understand it well enough.
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:56.020]  And they were using stress methods
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:57.940]  to create the pollen on the female
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:59.420]  where they should have been using that
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:01.420]  as the one to determine,
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.140]  don't use that plant because it did it, you know?
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:04.980]  Yeah.
[01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:09.060]  The hard to reverse ones are the ones
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:12.900]  that will never, ever, ever herm under any circumstances,
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:16.100]  like the runs or the really tall one,
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.980]  but the ones that are like the Hindu Kush
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:20.780]  or the, you know, these other ones
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:23.180]  with the multi fingered fans,
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:26.620]  those ones are more prone to, you can get herms, but the.
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:28.220]  I see. Interesting.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.420]  Well, it's been a blessing.
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:33.500]  I wanna ask you one more thing before we go.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.460]  Sure. Mr. Soul.
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:38.340]  It's like, okay, you're not in the shoe business.
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:42.060]  So tell me about, is it music related?
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:45.780]  Well, it's really a little deeper.
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:49.020]  When I was back in those early days on the internet
[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:52.180]  and having to come up with some kind of a handle
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:56.820]  for yourself, and I thought, well, you know,
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.900]  all these words that are gonna be pouring out of me
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:02.460]  through this keyboard onto the screen,
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:05.060]  where is that all coming from?
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:06.980]  And it's coming from my soul.
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:10.820]  And so it's Mr. Soul's words coming up
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:12.700]  and screen in front of me.
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.700]  Well, I love the vibe.
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:18.180]  I love Mr. Soul, and it's been a pleasure chatting with you.
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:21.340]  I'll get London to exchange information.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:23.740]  I'll get those seeds to you, but it's been a pleasure.
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.020]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.660]  Thanks so much to you.
[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:28.500]  Okay.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:32.300]  It was a great conversation and I'm glad to know you now.
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:35.100]  Thank you and tell your helpers, boy,
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.100]  I noticed they're good.
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:37.940]  I need them.
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:38.780]  Okay.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:42.140]  We'll do a...
