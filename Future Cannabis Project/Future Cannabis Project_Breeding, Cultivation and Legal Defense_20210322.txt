I'm from that era.
That's it.
Well, I was going to say we could.
I think we're all 80s kids.
So but you do look jacked in that picture.
You look buff.
Thank you, man.
Thank you.
So anyway, everybody, welcome.
Thanks for joining us.
It is Monday night at 9 p.m.
Pacific time.
It's I guess midnight
on the East Coast.
It's way after that across the
Atlantic, but we're here to
basically
help get someone out of jail
who's been in jail in El Dorado
County since last summer.
That's Christian Carter.
He's been on here and I'll actually
play a video a little bit later of
him after that conversation
with Bam and
Jackson. I think you were on that
one as well. But kind of like the
raids in Santa Cruz and then
Christian was drawing attention to
the fact that law enforcement was
fucking with people in El Dorado.
And basically,
Ashley, who is
bottom right,
for those who couldn't guess,
she is going to be representing
Christian.
So we appreciate that.
And we're
going to we have some every man
packs available so people
don't have to feel like they have to
drop five hundred thousand bucks
or anything like that.
So we'll just have a fun
conversation and
see where it goes.
But I got to put my two year old to
bed. So I'll leave it to
the three of you.
And actually, why don't you just
kind of talk about what's top of
mind for you
as you think about kind of from
a from a defense
lawyer's standpoint, what you're
seeing law enforcement do around
the state of California
in a legal cannabis market.
So I'm going to bow out and I'll
be back in five.
Absolutely.
So I
came to the legal field right from
a medicinal cannabis advocacy
standpoint.
So I've been kind of looking at it
from the outside before I looked at
it from the inside.
You would think that nowadays things
would be way different
than as they were,
say, just before
Prop 64 or
even years before that.
But.
Kind of what we're seeing now is the
same trend that we saw before.
You know, in 96, we got
to 15 and then
in 2004, we got SB 420
so that we actually had collectives
and cooperatives took law
enforcement about.
Till now to understand
collectives and cooperatives at all,
as soon as that law went out the
window.
I don't know how many times I
asked law enforcement on a
cross-examination about
what a collective or a cooperative
actually was.
And they could never answer the
question.
And whenever I would ask,
I would be told that that was
an improper question to ask.
They're not attorneys, even though
they were enforcing this law.
I actually had an officer come
up to me in
Tehama County and
ask me about some medicinal
cannabis law because he was like,
you seem to be really savvy at this.
You seem to really know what's going
on. Like, what is going
on? What?
How am I supposed to recognize any
of this?
This was in 2019.
And I showed him his first
medical marijuana program
identification card.
I pulled it out of my own wallet and
was like, this is what a state card
looks like.
And he was like, wow, I've never even
seen a state card.
And it was just one of those moments
where you realize that the law
enforcement agents that were
supposed to be able to recognize
these and not take medicine from
patients who had these state
issued cards had no idea what
they were looking for.
And then he followed up the question
saying, and how do I know
if somebody is actually licensed by
the state of California?
And I was like, you don't have
access to the BCC's
like roster.
You don't have someone
at the Bureau of Cannabis Control
to verify that for you.
And he was like, no, what do I do?
I'm like, well, OK, go to BCC dot
CA dot gov and you can use
their license lookup tool to
see the status.
And like I had to tell an officer
this who was supposed to be
enforcing it.
And I mean, he was taking it out
of his own time to catch
me in the parking lot to educate
himself.
And so it
really just is
horrifying to me that the people
who are supposed to be enforcing
this have to take it upon
themselves to find a defense
attorney willing to talk to them
to learn anything about it.
And that continues.
It's not just in Tehama.
I was recently on the
record credited by a district
attorney for teaching Amador
County's narcotics
team how they're supposed to
destroy cannabis.
They haven't gotten it right yet,
but they're getting better.
They do drop keywords now.
So I'll continue to challenge
that one until they get it right.
But we're in this
new world that is supposed
to have everything be
misdemeanors, right?
The California voters decided
that possessing for sale.
Wasn't a big deal.
This is a misdemeanor.
They're not too concerned about it.
Cultivating in excess of six
plants is not
allowed unless you have,
you know, specific
requirements met by your county as
a medicinal cannabis patient or if
you have a license.
But there's no
grading on how
many cannabis plants you have.
But I've had preliminary hearings
where I say, you know, your
honor, this should be a misdemeanor.
It's charged as a felony.
And the judge will say, oh, but
there were a thousand plants.
And I'm like, but.
Like, OK, my middle name
is Jean, none of these things
are relevant, like if it's over
six, it doesn't matter
what it is, because even
though they're misdemeanors,
they get charged as felonies.
Now, there are definitely
circumstances under the Health and
Safety Code that allow for them
to be charged as felonies if there
are.
Like bird
treaty act violations,
water code violations,
fish and game issues,
that kind of thing.
And I don't think that fish and game
ever got as much attention from law
enforcement as they did until after
Prop 64 passed.
Suddenly, those two agencies
are best friends
and are constantly working together,
whether that's fish and game and a
sheriff or fish and game in the
police department.
Anytime.
Cannabis, a larger
cannabis operation gets raided.
There is always a fish and game
officer there. Now, the most
creative fish and game
violation I have seen
charged is that
because the individuals in
question hadn't received
the permit that they would
need if they were discharging
water into the creek,
that they were in violation.
There was no evidence whatsoever
that any water was actually being
discharged, nor was
there any allegation that this
activity was actually taking place.
But the lack of a permit was
being used to charge it as
a felony.
But what really gets me
is when they charge misdemeanor
behavior as felony
conspiracy, because
this is a thing the prosecutors
are allowed to do.
They are allowed to charge just a
misdemeanor.
But if two people are involved,
they can charge it as a felony
conspiracy to commit
a misdemeanor.
And this is just allowed to fly.
So they're allowed to get
higher bail.
They're allowed to get holding
orders. They're allowed to drag
people all the way
through this felony
process, trying to take people's
rights away, all based
on misdemeanor behavior.
But because there were two people,
it suddenly felony conspiracy.
So it becomes this
ongoing process of trying
to not only inform law
enforcement of what's going
on, but of the court,
what law enforcement is supposed
to do.
My favorite,
if you would, which has become
a Tully and Weiss classic,
my firm is that law
enforcement never destroys
cannabis correctly.
They have very specific
guidelines that they are allowed to
follow to destroy cannabis
before the end of a case.
And I bring this
motion all the time.
It's health and safety code 11479
if anybody wants to get into the
code.
And it just requires certain
things. It's basically
that law enforcement has to make a
clear enough record that it doesn't
harm the defense's case for not
having the cannabis there.
But they never follow
it.
They just don't.
And I have had officer
after officer after officer
just give me these blank
stairs when I ask
about where their 11479
affidavit is.
So it is
really one of those ongoing
processes.
I see a comment at the bottom
about how overcharging and scaring
defendants into taking pleas is
something that happens.
That is absolutely
like a tactic used constantly.
We call that sticker shock.
Right. You put a really big price
tag on it so that the jail sentence
attached to pleading
to the sheet, if you would, is
really substantial.
And by adding just a couple of
extra charges, adding that
felony conspiracy to commit a
misdemeanor,
making each separate
activity a different act
so that they're charging it
in different ways.
Right. They they just stack
up this huge list so that people
are willing to take something
to get the case over with.
And then they use that as
a reason to, you know,
check up on your property next
year. After all, you were convicted
of cultivating cannabis unlawfully.
And that doesn't even start to
talk about the administrative
and code violations.
They just pile
on.
It is crazy to me the way that
structures that were bought,
like when somebody bought the
property, this structure existed.
It was part of the sale.
It had been there for 40 years.
And then suddenly when there's
cultivation on the property.
Well, that doesn't have a permit.
You're like, there wasn't even a
building department when that
building went up.
Like, are you kidding me?
And they're like, well, it doesn't
have a permit. So you're going to
have to pay us
eighty thousand dollars or tear
it down.
I mean, there are some counties,
Shasta County.
Oh, no, I believe it's the city of
Reading. If I have it correct,
charges one thousand dollars
per plant over
six plants you have
or a thousand dollars per
plant that is improperly
like not up to code planted
there.
So someone who has.
A dozen plants
is suddenly having a six
hundred dollar a day bill.
If their fence isn't high enough,
that's twelve hundred dollars
a day bill.
And it just makes it
impossible for
people to, I mean,
cultivate their own medicine
or just to be
a cannabis consumer in
a location.
The.
Something that makes me nuts and
you'll find that many parts
of the law do that.
Is that anyone's allowed
to grow six plants,
if you're over 21, you can grow six
plants, right?
But you have to do it in accordance
with your local code.
But your local code may
prohibit outdoor cultivation
and they can.
Regulate indoor cultivation
to make it totally impossible.
You can have six plants, but you
have to make sure that nothing in
your accessory structure
is transparent.
So no light is allowed to get
through. But you're not allowed more
than a thousand watts total
running to that accessory
structure.
So like good luck growing your six
plants.
Right. They're like, well, we don't
actually allow anything except LED
light bulbs. And you're like,
yeah, OK, like, good
to know.
But that would only be
able to be challenged if
somebody.
Challenges the ordinance itself
and suing City Hall
is.
I mean, that's a whole other ball
game. It's not something my firm
does, and I am not jealous
of the people who do it because
it is rough.
And I think we've all seen when
advocates get targeted
by their local law enforcement.
Right.
One of my first jury trials ever.
The Benno trial up in Shasta
County was a father and his
two sons targeted
because they were loud cannabis
advocates and they had
that sticker shock
complaint that they charged
everything in the kitchen sink
and I mean, we got
it all not guilty or dismissed,
but it took a long
time to get through that process.
And they had only brought the boys
into it because they wanted to get
dad to plead to something.
Charging the spouse,
the kids, the whoever
is in the area is a common
tactic because,
oh, well, I can tag them onto
conspiracy.
I had somebody carrying
dirt from the car
to the barn was enough
to have them charged with
conspiracy.
They weren't even part of the
cultivation process.
But the fact that they had helped
unload the car was used
to tag them onto the complaint.
And it's this kind of
behavior that you
can see isn't about following
what the law is and isn't
about following what the voters
said they want the law to be.
But it's just discouraging
the cannabis community from being
present in that area.
And.
Unfortunately, being a medicinal
cannabis patient or being a
cultivator is not a protected class,
but it's just discriminatory
and all of it is considered
allowed because it's for
a important public
health and safety issue.
Right. And it just.
It just really unfairly targets
a group that.
I mean, I personally adore.
I love cannabis cases for multiple
reasons. One, the officers always
screw up to the area of laws,
one that I spend, you know,
most of my time up to my eyeballs
in. But three, just the community is
great.
These are people that I have no
problem hanging out with and want
to. I spend time.
As often as I can, really,
lots of.
Lots of individuals are like, oh,
well, I mean, the office smells.
I'm like, look, can you take a deep
breath?
Like, that's what I want my office
to smell like.
Any time that I get someone
to come in, I'm like, yes,
people get jealous because I get
left flowers by some of my clients.
And it's my favorite
kind of flowers when I can take them
home at the end of the day.
So it it's
one of those that I do
compliance work as well
as criminal defense work.
So I help people get their permits
and get their licenses and such.
And so because I help
throughout that process,
I do know the process
better than anyone else in the
courtroom does.
I've had judges say, oh, I didn't
know that. You know, I've had judges
point out that I clearly know
the law, the best in the room.
That one, we got a factual
finding of innocence for our
defendants so that not only
did they not have a conviction, but
the officers actually had to destroy
the arrest report because it was
such.
A work of fiction,
to put it kindly,
so it but it's really interesting
because that's not how all judges
see it. I had a judge absolutely
agree with me that now that cannabis
was lawful, that the smell of
cannabis was not enough
for them to go in and search
and that there was cannabis
probably growing in
this garage was not
enough because there was no evidence
that there were more than six plants
in there.
Right. I was like, they're allowed
to be growing six.
There's nothing in this warrant that
indicates that they're not allowed.
They say how much energy this
house is using.
But there's no reference in this
warrants affidavit.
How much a regular house uses.
They were talking about Stockton in
summer.
And I was like, you think this
electric bill isn't going to be high?
Have you ever tried to keep a house
air conditioned?
Like.
And the judge admitted he said,
oh, you know, I hadn't even thought
of that. Like, you're right.
We totally would need to know the
baseline to know if they were growing
more than six.
But this looks like the warrants I
sign all the time.
So district
attorney, next time you write
a war, you know, you have an officer
write a warrant, tell them to include
it. And I know I'll be looking next
time I sign a warrant to see if the
officer put it in there.
But I'm not going to quash this
warrant.
This warrant is just fine.
And the fact that he admitted
that it would have to be different in
the future, but that this
was fine for now.
Is all too commonly.
How it goes.
It's not enough to protect
this defendant, but it's
enough to inform an officer's
behavior next time.
And that's just completely
inappropriate.
If the officer screwed up,
then the remedy has to be given
on the case they screwed up on.
Because that's somebody's life.
And the fact that it's like, oh, we'll
just tell the officer to learn like,
OK, tell the officer to learn
and give them incentive
by letting this defendant's
rights be vindicated.
And every time an officer
gets told to do
better instead of somebody
getting their charges dismissed,
that's just a miscarriage of justice.
And yet that's what happens.
And so we have officers
writing warrants, talking about
felonious activity
that is now misdemeanor
activity.
And despite the fact that they
haven't updated their boiler
plate since
2008,
they get away with it.
And that's where I try
to not let them get away with it.
That's where I run motion after
motion, after motion.
I mean, I've had district attorneys
basically give an
offer or dismiss cases because they
just don't want to deal with me
anymore.
They're like, look, Miss Bargainquest,
if I have to read another one of
your motions, like I have six inches
of paperwork on my desk from you.
And I'm like, well, it can all go
away if you just dismiss this
case.
Like, promise you don't have to
brief me back if you just
dismiss it.
But the crazy thing is,
every single one of those motions
and all of the evidence I give
is for a different
rights violation.
I'm not filing this paperwork
to bother them.
I'm filing this paperwork because
their officers screwed up
and they need to know that.
And so if there's
six, eight, 12 inches of
paperwork on their desk, it's
because their officers screwed
that much paperwork
up.
And that's what we're just going to
keep doing until they learn
how to do their paperwork correctly
or maybe learn that this, in fact,
isn't the devil's lettuce
so they can watch a different
propaganda film than Reefer Madness.
We can all just let
an officer go home and smoke a bowl.
Frankly, I think a lot of them need
it.
That is true.
Well, hearing my echo,
I'm going to see who is.
I think that's Ashley is a
reverb.
But
Valencina is down for the three
count. I promised her that she'd
grow at least an inch if she
agreed to go to sleep.
So.
So.
I missed most of what you said, but
I'm seeing in the chat that you're
saying a lot of interesting stuff.
And if someone needs a lawyer,
they want you as their lawyer.
I figured, like,
we'll eventually get to
entertaining all of you
cultivators with some
breeding and cultivation talk.
But I thought we could hit.
Sorry, my mic is low.
I thought we could
talk about some kind of policy
stuff and kind of what's going on
in different areas.
Trevor, can you talk about
kind of tactically
what you guys did in Calaveras
County to get it?
It seems like it did a 180
as a county in terms of being like
one of the worst places to be someone
who smokes and grows
weed to one of the better places
to be.
Yeah. So.
First of all, we got organized
and there was
a lot of us who
beginning.
Particularly in 2015,
after the Butte fire happened,
a lot of people got together and
the county started to consider
regulating at that point.
And so when they initially
started considering regulations,
there was already an organization
that existed of cultivators
who were advocating for regulations
that went well
for the initial phase of regulations.
But we weren't very engaged in
electoral politics.
Calaveras is a very old, very
conservative community.
And the
2016 election just kind
of happened without us
like having any influence
in the candidates that ran
or got elected.
And some really bad candidates got
elected in 2016.
A guy named Clyde Clap, who
has a long history
of just being a real
piece of shit.
He has lots of police
reports for domestic
violence and abuse
of women and children.
And a whole slew of different.
Skeletons in his closet that we
didn't even know about when he was
running and we weren't.
We weren't focused on
the electoral side, so we
after the losses in 2016,
we focused our efforts much more
on electoral politics
and in that process
in 2018.
Well, first we had to
defeat a couple of efforts
to ban us through legislature
through initiative
efforts.
And with that, we
used the courts.
We were able to beat back
effort to ban us in.
I think it was
March of 2017.
And we had that thrown out
because the way that the proponents
of the ban had drafted it,
they drafted it wrong.
They essentially drafted it as a
county ordinance because
they had expected the county to
adopt it.
But it was a
citizen's petition.
And so we were able to use that
as a way of getting it thrown out
entirely.
We then had.
Basically, a year and a half long
fight to try and delay the ban
that was somewhat successful,
but eventually it got implemented.
And once the ban got implemented,
we did everything
we could legally to try and stop
it. Most of that was a fool's
errand.
And the reason for that is that
it's incredibly difficult to
sue your county
and to win in the local
jurisdiction.
The local courthouse, even though
it's a separate entity, is
still deeply entwined
in local politics and
the interest of the county.
So that was a big waste of
resources and focus.
It was necessary just to
put pressure in every single
avenue that we could apply pressure
in, but it didn't
get us anywhere necessarily.
It just sort of.
It didn't even really delay
the ban, but it created
a process through which we engaged
in the political process like
on all fronts and we exhausted
every administrative remedy that
was before
us.
We also made extensive use of
the Public Records Act.
I filed probably
100 Public Records Act requests.
I have almost every email Dennis
Mills ever sent.
And we used all of those Public
Records Act requests and
Brown Act complaints and
other open government sort of
laws to pressure
them and to make
every single decision that the
county made very difficult.
One of the things that they tried
to do was
in 2018,
they tried to adopt right after
they adopted the ban.
They tried to adopt 8.06,
which was an update
to the county code enforcement
mechanism. So
what they wanted to do was
streamline county code
enforcement, create an entirely
new system for dealing with
cannabis, increase the fines
to a thousand dollars per plant
per day for every plant
over six plants like
Ashley had mentioned.
And they wanted to create
administrative hearing officer
that would only address cannabis
and a number of other different
due process and procedural
streamlining processes that would
allow them to really
enforce their ban and not only
enforce the ban, but basically
we paid as
Calaveras County cannabis growers,
cultivators that were regulated.
We paid 13 million dollars in
taxes in
2017
and they banned us literally
while they were collecting that
13 million dollars.
And that money
essentially closed a massive
structural deficit in the county's
budget.
And their
plan for essentially
covering all of the costs that
would be associated with this
massive enforcement effort that
was going to be needed to enforce
the ban was to make us pay
for it through this new 8.06.
It turns out that it was written
by the, well, it's written
by a local county lawyer,
but he took all of it from
Silver and Wright.
Silver and Wright were a law firm
or are a law firm that
works for cities and
counties and they
essentially create a streamlined
code enforcement process
that allows cities
and counties to turn code
enforcement into a revenue
generating system.
Essentially, they can start
generating a profit off of
code enforcement.
And luckily, we
were able to
pretty much convince everybody in
the county that they were coming
for pot growers today, but they
were going to come for them
tomorrow.
And we successfully
got people to come
out in mass and shut down
the
proposed amendments to 8.06.
That happened
around June 2018,
and that's also the time
when it became pretty
clear that electorally we
were going to be successful in
getting Clyde Clapp out of office,
which ended
up happening in the
November general election in
2018.
We were able to defeat
Clyde Clapp.
Clyde Clapp's replacement has
been pro regulations, and
there were three
board members at that point who
supported cannabis regulations,
and they began the process
of talking about it because but
because government goes
slow and everything takes time.
It wasn't until October 2019
that the county started to adopt
regulations.
And at
that time, Dennis Mills
also went up for reelection
and we removed him from office.
And so
that process was
constant, like
we attended every single planning
commission meeting.
We attended every board of
supervisors meeting.
We watched every meeting.
We cataloged everything they said.
We kept records of everything
they said.
When it finally came down for
Dennis Mills reelection, we
completely destroyed him
from like the month
of December because last year's
primary got moved up to
March here in California.
So elections
typically have about a three to a
four month like lead
time. So
for the month of December, we
released constant stream
of information, making him look
like shit and
pointing out every single lie that
he had ever told.
And that's
that's essentially what you have to
do. You have to do
a complete and total
thorough
oppo research.
You have to find everything out
about the person.
I mean, I know the guy's entire
family tree.
I know the guy's every email
he's written from his county email
for multiple years.
And we
used every piece of information
that we could find against
him. We we also used
a divide and conquer tactic.
We recognize that there are
libertarian conservatives who
are pro cannabis and we appeal
to very conservative
people based on libertarian
property rights arguments are
our political action committee was
called Life, Liberty and Property.
We totally co-opted
conservative
politics because
we knew that that was a wedge issue
that could divide the
there's country club conservatives
in our community who are old
retirees who wanted to turn our
community into a retirement
community and had a vision of like
golf courses and fucking retirement
homes.
And then
the alternative that we presented
was one of the younger, more vibrant
community that would draw
tourists and other people into
the community through
the development of cannabis industry.
And that
was more appealing to
even a segment of the conservative
population.
And so we were able to
peel them off.
And in the end,
we success.
I mean, like in District
five where Clyde Clapp was
defeated.
I like to call it Alabama
on steroids because
Trump won Alabama by 20
percent. He won District five by
40 points
and similar
type of politics over in
Copperopolis and before.
So that was
our strategy.
We yeah, we did
everything. We did not let them
have any rest.
We went after all
of the opposition in terms
of the
Bill McManus was a big proponent
of the ban, and we
did everything we could to make him
look like a liar.
We defend
in California.
You're not allowed to lie or
make false or misleading statements
in a ballot argument.
And when they put their ballot
argument up to be put onto
the official ballot
booklet,
we went through everything they
said and pointed out
every false and misleading
statement and took them to court
on it and actually won on every
single statement.
And they were forced to
edit everything.
And they were like basically the
judge edited their
statements for them to represent
the more factual, truthful
characterization of events.
And so we did.
Yeah, full court press, you can't
let the bastards lie and you have
to expose every single thing
that they do constantly.
So people thought they were going
to show up for Jackson
talking weed all night and we hit
him with a heavy dose of Brussels
sprouts.
It's good for you.
So I think the last thing is
Jackson, do you want to just give a
quick
thing on kind of, you know, where
we hit
Ashley kind of is all over
Trevor, you're in
Calaveras.
Do you want to talk about
some of the big issues in
Mendocino right now?
I just want to say good job on that.
That's a whole lot of friggin work.
And I have been in front of
Calaveras County Council
and like, like, well done.
Like, thank you for your work.
That's incredible.
Thanks.
You're muted.
Thanks.
The big thing up here now is the is
the the phase three.
Originally, everyone thought there
was going to be capped, capped at an
acre.
And I have close friends who want
like want both to happen.
I put up a post the other day just
to see like where people stood on
it.
It's just a trip because like in my
area, it's the it's like
the the water table here
is like there's not really big
reservoirs or anything.
So everything's aquifer.
And it's a big aquifer
for a little place like there's
lots of water for everybody to use
residentially and a little bit of,
you know, just like gardening and
basic growing.
But
it's like
nobody really knows if it can take
very much of all this stuff.
So that's kind of like that's
the big law thing going on up here
right now as far as all the other
the other stuff that we have a new
sheriff and the new sheriff is
saying
basically they want
to enforce way harder because
there's a lot of there's a lot
of gnarly stuff going on
with robberies and stuff like that.
And it's all just such a trip.
So I'm like, you know, it's not you
don't get this without prohibition.
And they're like, but we legalized
and it's still here.
I'm like, you guys didn't legalize
anything. You know, it's obviously
like you can just look at the
symptoms and know it's still
it's obviously not legal enough
because when things are all the way
legal, then you don't have people
who are so interested
in it for the money.
And like, I don't want to see
people's livelihoods go away from
the money and everything.
But it seems kind of like the people
who really are into it
would kind of figure out a way to do
it no matter what.
And it being still so
overly regulated,
it's keeping it like
it might as well be no
no legal grows
at all the way everything's
functioning, you know.
So, I mean, that's kind of the
climate here now is
in the newspaper.
There was a thing it's like, oh,
look at these guys.
They showed up, these robbers and
they and they had all this tactical
gear. They had fake police
badges and, you know,
the and all this
bulletproof gear and helmets
and, you
know, military
law enforcement grade weapons.
And so when they were
showing up at places, they
were looking like they were law
enforcement, you know.
And it's
funny because they're like, we need
to enforce harder.
And I'm like, well, you know, if you
guys weren't enforcing it, these
guys would show up and everybody be
like, it's not the cops because
they wouldn't be here.
It's obviously robbers, you know,
but instead it's like, well, we
don't really know because they're
still busting people like so they
could basically go rob places
even that are permitted.
And people would be like, I don't
know, it's still kind of iffy
like what's going on.
And it's
just trippy because there's real
intelligent people looking at it
and going, yeah, it looks
like it's still bad.
You know, it needs to be enforced
harder. We need to get rid of it.
And I'm just looking at it going
like that's never worked.
It hasn't worked like from day one.
And that
element is all comes from it being
you know, illegal.
And it's just not it's still
illegal. You know, it's obvious.
So, you know, that's where it stands
now, like here.
It's it's a trippy thing.
So I'm not I don't really know
where they're going to go with it
from here, but just from like
reading the newspaper and quotes
from the new sheriff and everything.
You know, it looks like they're
probably going to try to start, you
know, enforcing heavier if they can.
And of course, you know,
everybody knows even if they go as
hard as they can go, they're still
not going to do nothing.
All they're going to do is basically
raise the price and make more people
come in and want to
and want to set up grows that aren't
even that aren't even really, you
know, from the area and are just
coming in like, oh, well, it's a
good place to do it.
It's kind of loose, but it's like
it's it's not, you
know, I don't know.
It doesn't it all doesn't seem
functional to me.
I think they just need to
just let it go, turn it into basic
agriculture and then it would,
you know, I think it would be a lot
easier.
And then, you know, you if they want
to.
It's weird with the regulation,
they're like, oh, OK, well, but
if people grow, though, but what
about this?
What about this?
This thing they violate?
What about that thing they violate?
It's like just let people grow and
then look for violations.
And then and then if you want to
hit them for the violations, hit
them for the violations.
You know, if they're that bad,
you know, fish and game can already
get you for a hell of stuff if
you're really if you're if you're
messing up the river.
That's that's a crime in and
of itself. It doesn't have to be
anything related to weed, but
then they don't get the tax money.
They don't get the permit money.
And I think it's pretty much
just a big cash grab
by the government that keeps it
from being
being let loose, you know.
But that's that's where we're at.
Ashley, any comments
on kind of.
What you've heard from these two,
I mean, absolutely.
It.
I feel like so much of the work
being done, like on the ground by
by you guys shows just kind of the
issue that the
regulation of the
BCC kind of brought.
Obviously, there are issues before
there are issues after at least
there's some level of
understanding on what following
regulations looks like now.
But I always say that the
regulations for each
county really come in
three flavors.
Right. You have your
applies to everybody
flavors that makes
sense. You're you need
to have labor agreements.
You need to have, you know,
OSHA safety.
You need to have payroll, et cetera.
And then you have your agricultural
and kind of
industry specific.
If you're retail, you need to have
your, you know, your
certain point of sale issues.
You need to have your ag.
If you're cultivation, you need to
have your industrial, if you're
manufacturing, et cetera.
And then you have all your reefer
madness ones and the reefer
madness ones are like you can't let
me even think about smelling
cannabis anywhere within 300
feet of your facility.
And I've seen rules like this in the
same counties that have pig farms
like three doors down.
And you just wonder why it is
that the order of odor of cannabis
is so offensive.
But no other smell ever
needs to be regulated.
And excuse
me, the these regulations
are so patchwork
and so inconsistent
from the Calaveras example of how
they were one thing.
And then as the county was
collecting money, they stopped
allowing it.
Right.
So even at the county, they're
inconsistent to just the differences
between counties.
You have each city
in each county, so each
incorporated city being given
their own rules for their cannabis
regulation and then the unincorporated
unincorporated area of that county
having its own regulations.
So we have over 150 different
regulations, 150 different
sets of rules for
this industry to follow.
And we're you know, the state
is wondering why it's so confusing.
They're wondering why
you're getting oversaturation
in some areas and nobody
interested in these licenses over
here.
And it becomes the,
you know, outside money coming
in, like was mentioned, that it's not
even locals anymore as
you get these really sophisticated
business actors coming in who
know nothing about the plant, who
care nothing about the community,
but they take it over.
Right. Because they buy up
the property and then sell it back
eight times more expensive per
square foot than it was before.
It is kind of this ongoing process.
And I mean, the BCC is going to
change things again, right?
They want to bring everything back
under the same umbrella instead of
having it in all the different
departments. But how that's
going to look when that's going to
happen is still kind of up in the
air. The BCC is just getting
its feet under itself.
They're only just beginning to
understand things.
So you have this state
agency, whether or not it's
the Bureau of Cannabis Control,
the California Department of
Ag, whether or not it's
the manufacturing cannabis
branch of public health and safety.
It's all of these different
agencies learning a whole
new industry.
And just when they're about to get
the hang of it, we're going to
change it again.
And so you have them
fighting to make
it a more accessible industry,
theoretically.
Right. The BCC always says that's
one of their goals.
And then the counties making
it so that either
it's so arbitrary
that somehow
it always ends up being the
mayor's nephew who gets the
license.
Or if you aren't
from Silicon Valley, like you're
not getting that license.
And so it
is just one of those processes that
there is no clear answer that I can
see to fix it.
But the
real hard work that's happening on
the ground is the only way to
address it. And I think that
there was some really excellent,
you know, advocacy points about
how to get involved with that local
government so that you
can be
at least have an advocate in the
room when regulations are put in
place.
Thank you.
Well, let me mute you so I don't
hear myself.
But all right.
Yeah.
So basically,
we're all here tonight.
And.
There's I kind of view it like a war
where there's like a man down in the
field right now and we got to kind of
run out there and grab him and pull
him to safety, but then hopefully
take a step back and have kind of a
bigger, coherent strategy.
Like, you know, my my
my thought was kind of
could we in Eldorado
pull a Trevor approach and,
you know, change the, you know,
change the deck and in the board
of supervisors to a
or even like the sheriff, like,
you know, if we raise some money to
put a candidate up against the
current sheriff, who's a total douche
and I'm blanking.
Is it D'Agostini?
Is that the the current
sheriff? Do you know?
D'Agostino, D'Agostini, I'll
dig his name up because I think he's
been there for a while, but
anyway, Christian has
been in prison or in jail,
I should say, county jail.
That's Christian right there.
When I told Christian that
the high powered law
firm of Tully Weiss
with Ashley leading the charge was
going to represent him over
the public defender
originally put on his case.
This was his
and by the way, I'm realizing my
cell phone's up there.
Nobody call me.
So he's very appreciative.
That's the financial kick in the nuts
I took today to retain
the high powered law firm.
And then basically
this guy and
this guy were
nice enough to step up and try
to help me recoup some of that
to to to put their nuts
in the line of fire a little bit.
And so they've made some
some packs available at every
man prices, which
earlier today,
I my data
entry was strong today.
So if you go there, you can find
some of Trevor's stuff and some of
the stuff Jackson was willing to put
up. But basically, the goal
now is, you know, let's get Christian
out.
Christian wants to dedicate.
You know, I told him, like, let's get
you out before.
Like, you can't really advocate from
in prison very well.
And let's get you out and then you
can be part of the team to
help affect change,
you know, in his county.
Or I think, you know, here it's kind
of sharing best practices
and ideas and tactics where
people can apply them to their local
jurisdictions.
If they hear something that you're
they're like, you know, that's a good
idea that could work where I am.
So before we let you go, Ashley,
and we'll bring Ashley back on a
recurring basis
to talk kind of policy and advocacy
and
what's going on with
people in prison, maybe not
specifically the case at hand,
but general kind of big picture
stuff. So I just wanted to quickly
play something which was
Christian after
we did something on kind of what was
going on in Santa Cruz.
I think last spring.
So give me one second.
And the sheriff is John D'Agostino
Steeney.
So D'Agostini.
OK, and of course, it's not
going to.
OK, it will not let me play the
video file I wanted to queue up, but
I'll queue it up in a bit.
But Ashley,
you can go to bed now.
Thank you for staying up with us.
And I'll check in with you tomorrow.
Of course, I look forward to it.
And thanks so much for having me on.
And lovely to hear from
all you guys. Have a good one.
Thanks for talking with us.
And all right.
So we also have Mr.
Toad. I sent you a link and
cascading of you're in there
somewhere. You got a link to so we
can shoot the shit for a while.
Trevor, what's Action
Jackson? Yes, that's right.
But I put your I don't know if you
checked it out, but I put your stuff
under.
It's not under Freeborn, it's not
under Mean Gene from Mendocino,
it's under Action Jackson.
Cool.
So but.
Trevor, you've been
diligently documenting
history. So who are some
of the the historical
characters in the the cannabis
breeding game that you
find particularly interesting?
All of them. I mean, it's been
fun just reading about everybody
and going through everybody's old
forum posts and digging through
everything that's well,
whatever is still available or
accessible.
I just was.
Today's post was about old timer,
so like thinking about
old timer one.
Very cool UK breeder.
His posts go way back to
the origins of
online cannabis forums, and you
can still find some of them from the
late 90s that are out there.
So it's pretty interesting
to be able to read
somebody's post as
they develop from different forums
and different communities over 20
years. It's
it's kind of a.
It's an oddity or a rare sort
of thing to see a cannabis writer
in an online forum sort of like
develop over time like that
in his work school.
It's very, very
focused on older
quote unquote sativas and early
drug varieties.
And it was
just cool going back and reading a lot of
his posts because it's not
just focused
on one thing.
You know, it was very,
very knowledgeable about
light spectrums and
light technologies.
At that time, he was very knowledgeable
about soil and
organic cultivating practices.
His bonsai technique was super
cool.
Google that if you haven't seen it
and if you've got limited space,
it's totally worth looking into
his techniques.
And so that was
fun.
Other than that, I mean, I also
just did Jackson's, so
that was awesome going
looking at Jackson's.
You know, I went to the very
first post on Instagram
and went through every
single post that you've ever posted
as way back.
Yeah. Yeah.
No, it was good times.
The feed was a lot more sensible at
the beginning.
The memes get heavy.
Smiling, you know.
Yeah. Yeah.
But no, so that was a lot of fun.
And yeah,
so it's been good times going
through everybody's histories.
It's cool.
You should put it together if you
can, if there's a way to do it, it'd
be cool to put it together as like
a I don't know, has a
blog or a book or something
like that, because it's got to be
there's not really
it's like all those things that are
referenced, they're all little
they're little pieces.
You got to hunt around a lot.
And then you've
already kind of tracked down and put
all the stuff in place.
And it's it's cool to see because
otherwise it's like a big
it's like a little snippet out of
this obscure book
and a little forum thing
and, you know, a lot of cool stuff.
Yeah.
Did we not talk about that idea?
Yes. No, we have.
And so it's
going to happen.
I think
it's one of those things where
like.
I my intention
has kind of been to do that, like
once I started like
first, it was just going to be a
couple of posts and I was going to be
like, here's three
posts about the history of breeding
or like key figures.
But now, as
I went into it, it really was
that element of pulling
all these things and compiling
an archive and like.
I would like to host or like
put it up online somewhere because
I've pretty much gone through
and I've got screenshots of
every specific breeder that
I've looked at.
There's a little file for each one of
them. There's a little write up, which
is my best synopsis.
And, you know, I'm I'm not
talking to anybody before I do any
of these either.
I'm just kind of doing them and
then like seeing
what the reaction is.
I would like to do it in a more
collaborative way that,
you know, just so I make sure that I
don't fuck anything up once this
actually gets like for
sure, for sure compiled, whereas like
for now I can go back and edit my
Instagram posts and make shit right
if I fuck anything up.
Hey, Toad.
How goes it, Toad?
How you doing, brother?
Hey, all them posts you're putting up
are killer, man.
It's stuff that a lot of people need
to see. There's so many people that
are just coming into the cannabis
community and they don't know
anything about breeders.
All they read about is the stuff in
magazines or what their friends told
them. And to find out that
information from breeders that
actually put in this work is awesome
stuff, man. So I appreciate that.
I want to tell you that 100%.
Thank you, man. Thank you.
Yeah. You are also an inspiration
there, too, because you were doing
that right when we came on
a couple of months, you know, a few
months back, you were posting a bunch
of stuff on the Hays and it was nice
to see those historical posts and
actually like people going back and
referencing
original material and not just,
you know, spouting off.
It's good to see.
Yeah, man, that's what I think that's
what it needs to be out there.
If you're going to drop a line on some
people, give some history behind it,
give some information.
Don't just talk about yourself.
Talk about where it came from.
If you can talk about some of
the work, the other guys that brought
that to the community might have put
in. That helps people understand
the kind of work that it takes to
bring these kind of things to folks.
So it's like we didn't just start
three months ago on a tent and make
some seeds and bring them to you.
We've been posting up in houses
for years, underground bunkers,
man, with the amount of electricity
people are putting in, the amount
of time that they didn't
spend with their own family at certain
times, because back in our days,
like everything we were talking about
here, you couldn't talk about cannabis
back in the day, man, especially in my
county. Like they're talking about
Reading.
Reading is one of the worst places
that you could grow cannabis in
California.
It's a terrible place, but there's
tons of places like that.
But there's guys like myself and
others out there that have been
risking themselves doing this stuff.
And when you give that information
out there, it puts it in perspective
for folks, lets people kind of
understand what they're going through,
what they might have had to done.
People are afraid of just showing
their own little tent.
And we're out there, you know,
wasting too much time with a plant
and it needs to be told.
So all those guys that you're talking
about that you put up there, guys
that came way before me that put in
so much more work, put in time on all
the forums, sharing information.
To me, those are the pioneers in this
community that helped push it
in the direction that's going.
And that's what we need more of.
We need people that are willing to
step up and give that information
out to each other instead of hoarding
it and just keeping it closeted
doesn't work, doesn't help anybody.
So what you're doing and what
everybody else is doing is killer
stuff.
That means a lot.
So, Mr.
Toad, someone had a
question that
they sent me yesterday
and it was asking if someone could
drop some knowledge about haploids.
Half-bloods.
I just have to do it, the
chromosome count of plants, so
cannabis is a diploid, has 20 in
count on the half number, there's
tetraploids, there's I mean,
there's all kinds of different
ploidy versions of plants.
But cannabis is a diploid.
Mostly there's cats working on
doing some tetraploid stuff
that's going to come across as
breeding sterile.
It's going to be a way to help
people grow outdoors without getting
their plants pollinated.
I also posted something up earlier
yesterday, I think it was the day
before, about artificial apopmyxis
in plants where they're trying to
make clonal replications of plants
from seed.
They're going to be able to do this
by using a mutation that's found
in the line and then
back breeding it to one of the
parents that they want to retain
the genetic coding from.
And it only offers the genetic
codes from one side and not both
parents like most diploids will do.
Since when you get the sperm
and ovary going, they only have one
set. They have to combine together
to give you that two in.
And when you have multiple forms
of the gametes
in there, the genetic coding
makes some of the plants
not want to breed together.
And that's what they're working on
right now. If we can get artificial
seeds with a copy
of the mother or the father that we
want after it, this allows us to keep
the virile going, the chemotype
going. We can offer that in seed
form without having to pass clones to
folks. It keeps the stock alive
way longer, a lot less work.
I wish I could get my phone to work.
It just started shutting down on me.
I just posted that up on Instagram.
I was trying to send some stuff over
to you, Peter, before I came on here.
For some reason, my phone is just not
working.
I cannot send anything through Gmail
to your brother here.
Hold on.
Where's which?
Here, give me one second.
Where is it?
Let's just share that.
All right. Take a look at take a look
at the screen.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to find
it on right now.
Which one it is, flavonoids.
Where is it that?
It would be.
Sorry, not this one.
Not the.
Yeah, you're on the wrong one, man.
You want to be filial filial.
And it would have been three posts
back, it says last year, Chan
and you see Davis postdoctorate
researcher Ravi show that
they could breed haploid.
Our bridges are
process plants, I can't say that damn
word very good, but that whole post
has to do with them coming up with
artificial seeds that actually are
a pop mixes creations
that carry only one copy
of the genetic code from one of the
parents are working on that with
tomato plants and some others.
It's I just shared that it just came
out from UC Davis in February.
So this is just a brand new write up,
man. They're just starting to do this.
But UC Davis, I believe it was
2011.
It's the first time they made a
clonal copy of a plant in seed
forms, and it would have been with
the plant that's listed right there.
They're trying to do this with
multiple different plants because
what we know of in plants, when they
breed, they do not show a true
version of themselves in seed form
happens with apples, avocados,
cannabis. There's a lot of plants
that when they breed in seed form,
they do not offer you the exact
genotype that came from the seed
that just cannot happen because of
the way they produce.
So if we can get them to only offer
the genetic coding from one of those
parents that offers an exact copy
of that parent. So you got plants
like ferns, ferns breed through a
mixes, which means you get a
clonal copy of the plant that it
came from. And it's been happening
since that plant's been around here.
There's there's a lot of I believe
mangoes breed through
a mixes.
I might be wrong on that one.
There's a few plants that will
breed through a pop mix.
It's just a form of asexual breeding
without any pollen being
introduced.
So you're only getting the genetic
coding from the actual plant that
produced it.
And what they're talking about there
has to do with actually finding a
mutation that's in the genetic
coding of the plants you're working
with and not actually using like
CRISPR to change
it.
So it's in the genetic code.
It's just a matter of
kind of phenol honey, but they're
doing it on a basis
of doing genetic testing.
They can pull up the markers to
genetic coding. They'll be able to
find out what they're looking for
much easier than us doing it with
their eyes.
Way easier.
So, Trevor, someone asked
if there is a request for
an Eddie Lep,
something on Eddie and then
of course, it's way up in the chat.
But
yeah, Dennis Perron.
There we go.
Yeah, I
should do something on Eddie.
I remember back in the day
when those early
high times write ups came out and
seeing what Eddie was doing, it was
like some next level
shit. It was
the first time you were seeing those
giant 10 pounder type
plants and
that was getting like publicized out
to the world. So those articles
are great.
And I know
I he's in the
I think it was the second can of
Bible. There's a
bit of some good shots of Eddie.
There's also all the work that he
did. Well, the farm that they
set up in Lake County.
That ended up getting raided,
all that story should be told.
So that's something that
is is missing.
I know bits and pieces.
I remember while it
was going on in real time, but I'd
really I should do a deep dive and
give him his due.
And definitely
everybody should also, if you
can, help support
Eddie. He's his health is failing
this year. You know, he's getting up
in his years and
anything we can do to help him out.
And just remember
that dude
dude was out there doing things
in a way that a lot of other people
weren't doing. And it was inspiring
and it got a lot of other people
to go out and try crazy shit
and that
he also went to jail and he
did his time and he came back into
the community and he's still popping
off. The guy's the legend.
So let's give him his due
and I will intend
to make a post there.
I am I did make a
I didn't do full justice
to Dennis either.
Instagram, unfortunately, is not
the best platform for
in-depth analysis, but
I did make a post
about some of the
just the medical scene back
in 2015 and really the people
who helped to
initiate the movement and create
it and get it over the hump
in 96, 97.
And so
Dennis is somebody who deserves a
lot more credit and recognition for
everything he did.
He definitely spearheaded
the movement and made it so 215
happened. And like, you know,
we've just been talking about the
regulations for,
you know, 64 and
what's happened and
actually was talking about how even
up till like last
year, you know, recently,
they didn't know what the hell a
collective or a cooperative was.
That was by design.
Like the people who wrote 215
basically wrote a
paragraph
with a bunch of words that didn't
mean shit in the law.
There was no case law
for what a not for profit
collective was.
There wasn't any case law
for a lot of that stuff.
And that gave us
20 years to,
you know, pop off and be out
in front of the law and
be out in front of the precedents and
the case law in a lot of ways.
And so Dennis
is somebody and all the people
around him, they deserve infinite
credit for what they designed, what
they created, because I
mean, I have no experience with any
other state, but what happened in
215 was a unique
and special time to be alive.
And I'm really glad I was
there. And those people
who made it, Eddie,
Dennis, we all owe them
immensely for that.
That's a fact.
And it is not much more
damn.
Um.
Some Afghani guys from
eighteen hundred
the cats, you know,
to Africa, the cats who took
it to, you know,
Southeast Asia, the king is gone.
How much we see.
So so because I feel
outnumbered here in SoCal,
I'm going to bring on my
little balance to this
conversation.
Yo, yo, yo, gentlemen.
Hey, what's up, trees?
I snuck out for a few minutes
to burn one with y'all.
And
Peter was gracious enough to
give me the opportunity.
Here we are.
The kids are in the beds.
Finally, man.
Finally, dinners, dinner
dinners.
I finally got to eat, which is
great. I mean, I feel like
I feed everybody else and run
around all day and I finally
got to eat. Kids got to go to
sleep and then
burn one down, you
know, sleep like a baby tonight.
So it's been
a good day.
So, Jackson, someone earlier
asked if you
could talk about Jaro.
So that was the.
I had.
I had that really killer black
Afi I got from my buddy
that came from up on Spiroch
and it was.
Kind of rough when he got it.
And
he bred it a little bit and the
ones that he liked, he called
Sugar Afi because they were a
lot more resinous than what the
big population was.
And he had two kinds,
he had the big jar that
originally he was given
of like seeded weed.
And he called that the big jar
black Afi.
And then he had the sugar Afi and
he gave me some of the sugar Afi
seeds.
And I grew those and I crossed
them.
I crossed them with Urkel and I
crossed them with Hindu
two different the two different
clones and
the Hindus like a old one from
up here that's like
super similar to Baba past
as Baba in L.A.
for some years.
And it was
better than than the Baba that
I've seen as far as it was just
had a really like
when you if somebody smoked it in
a room, you could walk in and go,
damn, you guys are burning Hindu,
you know, like it was very
incense and dank.
And so the black Afi was like
that, too, when you with the sugar
Afi, when you would burn it, you
could smell it. It was that old
school what we call reggae weed,
because when we were at reggae on
the river, we used to always smell
it in the parking lot or in the
show coming from like humble
people.
And we would get it in our
seeds, but it would never
be all the seed.
It would like pop out here and
there. And like it's a weird one
because like is even if you're
familiar with Baba and those kind
of weed, when you
when you smell it,
it's not really loud unless
you know that smell.
And once you're familiar with it,
when you smell it, you're like, oh,
that's that's not one.
But at first, it's really plain
weed.
So we'd always be thinking
like if it burns and it smells like
that, it must be really stinky
weed. And so it would just kind of
slip past us.
And every once in a while, someone
would grow on it. We'd be like,
what the fuck? Which one was that?
Because we've got to figure out
what that smells like when it's not
burning because it's got this
incense, crazy incense smell.
That's how those hazel ones are,
too. You smell the weed and you're
like, this is plain as fuck.
This is what you guys like.
And then someone lights it up next
to you and you're like, whoa,
that's that shit, you know.
So it was that Hindu super
fire. It was like grown indoor.
It would be like almost like
the the frosty resin
where like we learned
to think that that was like the
fake resin after a while because
it's like anything that looks
frosty and white like that is
usually bullshit because it's all
legs and no heads on that
on the resin.
And so
it was one of those ones that looked
crazy white, like the resin looked
like Velcro, you know, just like
crazy, you know, super just
growing up and folding back onto
itself and just covered in a
carpet of white and
like a similar one that I saw
was like the white master
Kush from from OG
Rascal.
That was like really similar.
The ones that they had when they
would be at shows and I'd check out
their jars.
And so
was that black Afi, which
was like old hardcore Afghani
with the big, huge leaves with
like one fingers like this wide,
like from year to years, one
finger that like 15 fingers
and like, you know, 13 of them
would be like big, full size, crazy
fingers. So the leaves would be
like huge like this.
But it was taller than like
monkey balls like each chunk.
It was bigger than that.
And
it was way more mold resistant,
which was really nice.
And it had a little bit of a
looseness to it.
But it was still like these chunky
round buds. But it wasn't like
some of those Afghanis where it's
just like a rock.
It was a little more squishy, which
made it smoke hella good.
So I crossed those together
and then I took that
and I called that coffee kush or
black coffee because it was like
that they both had unburned.
They have the coffee smell burnt.
They have the incense smell.
And so
I put those together and then I
got that Hollywood pure kush.
That's that OG one.
And I crossed those
together just because I was like,
oh, this is this.
This is really bomb.
Let's see if it comes out good.
And I was kind of trying to make
OG stuff.
I was trying to make OG seeds and
it didn't work because the
Afghanis are more dominant.
And I was like, ah, but they got
bigger.
And so it was like it was like a
coffee kush that was bigger.
And I was like, oh, that's pretty
cool. And then
I ended up putting it on a sour.
I got sour and I got headband
and they were both really similar.
But the headband was a little
gnarlier.
But the sour was like original
sour. Like it has that.
I have that good, like super skunky
smell, real gnarly,
like metallic to me.
But some of that coffee smell like
the Hindu had and
really nice.
And it was just an old sour cut.
I think we got it. It showed up
around 2003, 2004.
I wound up breeding it not until
like 2007, I think.
But it had been around and I had
made some seed at my buddy's house
who gave me the black affie.
And I never got
any of them back from them and
stuff. And so eventually I was like,
well, I want to breed that.
So I remember he planted that sour
and was like.
It was like I swear,
he planted clones and it was like
August 1st and he planted
clones like this.
And I went back to his house and
they were like seven foot Christmas
trees. And I was like, this shit
fucking grows and the weed is
good. And he's like, yeah, but it
doesn't finish till late.
It doesn't finish till November.
If you really want it to go good.
But it's really dank.
And I was like, wow, I didn't know
like because I'd seen it indoor
before that for a few years.
So I didn't have an idea of what it
did as like a big outdoor plant.
So I was like, damn, that'd be
that that's super bomb.
So I ended up hitting that
with the PK Hindu Afi
because it
was just like that.
It turned out that the PK Hindu Afi
was killer, killer weed.
And so.
That when I made that, that's what
Jara was, was the sour cross
and then the root beer
was the clone that I kept out of the
headband cross.
So the root beer and the sour.
The root beer and the and the
Jara.
The only difference is the headband
and the sour.
And if you saw the headband and the
sour and bags and you don't really
know your shit, you would look at
them and you'd be like, this is the
same weed.
It's like hard to tell, except if
you know, like super skunk, you
smell the headband and it's got a
little bit more of that to it.
So it was super
bomb. But so like when you see stuff
with Jara, like if you grow,
if you grow Jara
like Lion Tree, I gave him some
Jara seeds and he grew them and he
was like, man, I got this killer
root beer one out of them because
he's grown root beer seeds, too.
And he's like, it slipped past me
and I wish I would have kept it.
But
it's like it's kind of the same
thing, except the headband
cross more of the plants were more
narrow and the root beer has like
smaller buds, more neatly
arranged and not long colas as
much.
And it's a little bit more
like kind of like the buds are
shaped more like this and the sour
cross, the buds are shaped more
like this.
And like my mom calls the sour
cross, like because I took
the I took this I took the Jara
males originally and I put
them on.
I took the sour cross, which is the
Jara, and I and I inbred that.
And out of the best ones, I have
what I call Jara one, and then I
seeded the headband cross of the
same males.
And that was there
was a few of those ones, but the
one that I kept was out of the
root beer and the root beer
crossed with the Jara males is
what I call Jara two because it
was like the same thing in a way.
But the Jara two has
more like and the root beer has
more little buds, more evenly
spaced.
And the other one is more chunky.
My mom called that one fat jar
because when you grow them side by
side, you're like, well, that's
like the big fat plant with a big
fat buds and fat leaves.
And then the headband cross was
more to the headband side
because of the root beer plant was
in its structure leaned to that
side.
So like the seeds
that I put up are T1000,
which is triangle cush cross purple
oracle.
And that was made by CSI
and is a really, really cool cross.
And then I think
maybe that's old family purple, but
I can't remember. Maybe that was
the Mendo Perks cross, but I can't
keep track of that.
But the T1000 is the oracle
triangle.
And I got that
clone and I hit one of them with a
gelato 33 cherry limeade
and I hit the other one
with with the Jaro.
And
I don't have many of those seeds.
So I basically figured I just like
take half of them and put
and put those up.
So like that's there's 30 packs up
right now.
And that's like half of all the
seeds that I have of that cross.
It's like I could remake it with
different Jaro, but it would be a
different male. So if this one's
awesome, it's awesome.
I haven't grown them if they're,
you know, if they're not awesome,
they're not.
But, um.
Man, that picture, that chick is
hot right there.
Look at that.
Look at that structure.
Get you some.
Look at those cheekbones.
Jeez.
Little big in the face, but, you
know, someone said it
looks like you
harmed.
Yeah.
I mean, it can happen.
I have a guy, the other guy there.
You don't look like you're on your
own right anyway.
So you know,
chop it up to grow.
I was going to put the effort
to to put Trevor's face
on that side.
But I had my two year old like
climbing all over my head while I
was trying to Photoshop
this. So far
as I got.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
I've done several of the
CSI
vertical crosses and stuff
like that. Man, those things are
fucking fire.
He's done various ones, Mr.
Yoji's and every
other knee cross circle, everything
this way and that.
And the triangle, I've gone several
of the triangle crosses, you know,
the triangle can't make you once
triangle
triangle, all kinds of shit
from CSI directly, you know.
And yeah, they
are always just out of
this world. I never got to 1000.
I never played with that one.
But that if it's
triangle to the earth, all that's
fucking that's got to be that's
got to be swell.
What's really bomb, because it has
like that candy cream thing that
Urkel has
and then it has like a cushiness to
it, too.
But to me, it's more like creamy.
It's almost like.
I don't know, it's a trippy one,
it's like you can tell you can tell
when you smell it that that like
if you told me that like the gelato
stuff was a variation of
a goal thing, which
is not shocking because we know
that the cookies and all that stuff,
like if you know your types, when you
breed those things, you're like
there's Urkel influence
in there. And yes, I was good
pointing that out because he does
that. He does the cell things and
like cell things don't lie.
It's like you sell it.
You know, it's not from the mail.
It's from that plant.
And when you sell it's like doing
it, it's like doing an additional
inbreeding.
So if you sell it to it,
it's like you're getting an F3.
If you sell it at one, it's like
you're getting an F2, you know,
because it's an inbreeding, you're
getting all your assessors popping
out.
And so
you really get to see all that
stuff. But when when you see
that, just that cross of a
of a real Urkel
and
and that's what's cool about his
stuff, too, is, you know, the
Urkel he has, that's real
Urkel. It's not like you could
easily get something and it's a
Urkel cross and you're like,
you know, you could show it to me.
And if it was one that threw to
that side really well, you'd
be like, I mean, the leafs are
right, buds, right,
smokes, right.
This this could be it, you know.
But when you know that somebody has
really held it as long as he's held
it and he got it from people who had
already had it since basically
when it first got named and
everything,
then, you know, it's the real deal.
But that that one turned out
to be a really nice one.
And I wasn't sure exactly
what it was going to do and what it
was going to be.
It's a little bit on
the smaller side from the Urkel in
comparison to some stuff.
It's a little bit slower, but it's
not as slow as Urkel as far as I
could tell. I didn't have a side by
side. But in relation to the other
things I grew up with, it
seemed like it had a little bit more
bigger than a Urkel or a lot
more bigger than a Urkel.
Urkel's really slow.
Slow. Yeah.
Yeah. But but
but still not stretchy.
It's still not it's still a nice
kind of compact plant, even
though it grows healthy.
Symmetrical.
Yeah. And nice chunky
nugs.
Really pretty like out outside,
like in the depth and full term
outdoor. It was really shiny.
It got some color to it.
And then it
had it just had a nice like a creamy
candy with a little bit of that
cushiness to it.
And it was bomb.
And so I figure that these
ones crossed with the Jaro.
The Jaro is really big and really
rangy, but it's still super
chunky.
And it has that nice
combination of like candy and
cushion, everything.
And so it's
it's like probably
a good combo, you know, to kind of
stretch that one out, but not it's
not like it's these crazy, weird
turf combination, you know.
And like I said, I only I only have
so many of them.
So it's like I just was like, all
right, what's half of them?
I probably have 50 or 60
packs where I put up to 30
packs. So whoever gets them
probably get really nice stuff, you
know, worth inbreeding forward
or use it on some other Kush
or perp or gelato or something
like that, because it'll it'll make
sense.
There are 10 packs left.
Cool.
That's sick, man.
I like, you know, I love all that
shit.
Yeah, I grew lots of CSI stuff
and I try to make sure whatever
I'm growing or I'm growing outside
the bubble ever.
You know, it's got to be verified
type stuff. So like that
triangle cushion and knowing
how strong that fucker reads and
seeing seeing me like
that nub structure and all those
things, man, I can only imagine,
you know, combined with the Jaro,
you know, that's got to be, you
know, that's a good package right
there. So.
It should be cool.
I might like to grow for sure.
And then, Trevor, do you want to
talk about some of the stuff
that you threw up?
Yeah.
So I put up
the
Magnum Opus across to the
Chem 101.
That was.
Something I made, I think, in
17, it was
just random.
I.
I had a Chem 101
mail that I just couldn't bring
myself to killing.
And so I let
him all in a
and get a little bit
of pretty much everything
in 17.
And so I got
got a lot of Chem
101 crosses and
the Magnum Opus
was like right next to it
and just got hammered.
And so I got
a lot of seeds from that one.
And it was I
gave them out to a bunch of people.
Funny enough, I met Sean
Shani Bez one
night back in the day or farms
because I didn't have
my wallet or any gas money
and I had run out of gas
and I was like in Berkeley, like I
didn't know if I could make it to
its place.
And he's like, if you can make it to
my spot, like come
over, like I'm putting the kids
to bed, but like
come on down, if you make it here,
I got I got you, homie.
And so I got to his place.
He came out, didn't know
that we really like knew each other
from Instagram.
And like we became really good
homies and
gave him some of those seeds.
He grew some of them out and they
actually they survived
out at his spot through
the fire.
Then Brett grew
them out in Santa Cruz and they
did well in Santa Cruz.
So
they're they're healthy, vigorous
plants that magnum opus
Jackson probably knows more about
some of the background there,
just it being some of Mandelbrot's
work in the Long Valley Royal Kush.
And that
seems to have imparted some
powder mildew resistance and some
ability for the plant to survive,
even though it's like a
broadly very
dense indigo plant.
But it did well on the
coast in Santa Cruz for a number of
different runs for both Dos Perros
and
for one of his homies
that he gave a bunch of the seeds to.
And when we hooked up again, he
picked up a bunch more because he
wanted more. So I think
I think it's a winner.
Then I also have a bunch of 88
crosses and
88 G13 hash plant
has been used by a lot of other
breeders. It was used by
spread around by Indian guy back
in the day.
It was given out with the condition
that it should only be given away
freely to people and never be sold.
Bodie used it for a lot of his
88 G13 hash plant
males.
His the deadly G was supposedly
a very dominant
88 G13 male that kind
of stomped on a lot of the things
that it was crossed to.
And he selected another male to make
some of his newer versions.
But what
I've found from it was the
88 has allowed other
things to express themselves very
well, where there will be
the 88 dominant phenomes.
But then there will be some that are
just dead ringers for whatever
the mother was there.
The Kendi crosses, the
D88 were phenomenal.
There were some in there that were
just on point,
totally like the mom.
And then there were some that were
very much like the dad.
And you could tell.
And that's one thing that's very
nice with you making
selections and you want to select
something closer to one or the other
parents. It's nice when they really
stand out and are so distinct.
But that wasn't the case with the
peanut, the peanut F4s crossed
to the 88s really
melded much more like a F1
hybrid.
I grew them side by side
and the peanut, the
hybrids grew
four times as fast as the pure
88s.
It was just they were super
uniform, super vigorous.
And it seems like the peanut
turps, that sweet pineapple
is in every single phenome.
I grew out like 30 females.
The the difference in distinction
that you'll notice is the
peanuts are more slender, a little
bit longer and
bit more of a, you know,
fluffier, more sativa nug,
whereas the candy nugs
are just, you know,
two liter bottles, just fucking
enormous colas.
And all of them are
sweet pineapple.
And then the other two, I haven't
I haven't tested the do-si-do 88.
The do-si-do came to me as the
connected cut, which supposedly
is connected.
An archive had a
contract together, so they
told me it was the archive cut.
I don't know.
It was fire.
It's lime green, purple,
peanut buttery cookie goodness.
So it's definitely an on point
do-si-do cut.
And the Sunshine 4
is it's a really
nice, really frosty,
super potent, gassy
pheno. Just it's legit.
Came from a real farmer Joe.
And it's one that,
you know, I believe that that
combination will be a real
knockout, you know,
couch loft.
You'll feel it.
So, yeah, those are those are up
there. There's 50 packs of those
and every pack comes
with a free pack of the 88's
thrown in.
So that people can,
you know, get to experience it.
And I really encourage people
if you get them.
Keep a male, use the male
breed with them and keep that
line going, share it with people
and, you know,
just keep keep moving that line
down, down the road and
keep what Indian guys set out
to do in sharing those
genetics with people because they're
really they're breeding stock.
Like it's something that's just
a joy to breed with and to see what
comes out in the wash on
every single cross.
And I've grown.
I've grown hundreds of them pure now
and.
Probably about a dozen different
crosses and it's
it's a winner.
It's something that,
you know, some of the structure
on the hash plant varieties aren't
the best,
but it's just knock
out herb and really,
really nice.
Some of them can rival
the Mac in terms of their frosting.
That's just caked.
So they're winners.
So when is the
the sun grown mids
brand launching?
Probably not.
What?
Probably never.
I'll keep to trolling on Instagram.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you
let like what?
What do you focus on and like
to explore?
I like older things.
I like anything that.
I really feel like.
The vast majority of good
things that we're all still passing
around are those late
80s Ghanis that
were being worked by Neville.
The things that he got from Greg
McAllister and the Seattle crew,
the things that he got from,
you know, from Sam and from
Ed and from Mel Lake
and from Ortega, Jim Ortega.
Like those lines are
the things that I think that we're
all passing around and have
different phenos of in terms
of the different chems and OGs
and things like that probably being
derived from that gene pool.
And
that's what I like.
I very much like those.
The 88 G13 hash
plants, the
anything that reminds me of 90s
weed.
I like that.
Anything before Hayes
just went completely to
the terpinaline jack sort
of washed out
bullshit Dutch Hayes.
I like that.
Like.
Those are the things that I grew up
smoking. And remember,
so I dig those
and land
races interest me.
I'm very, very interested in,
you know, maintaining and
preserving genetics that
are baseline genetics, be
they land race or classic
heirlooms.
So that's
that's where it's at for me.
And I feel like, you know,
there are elite keepers
that have been selected by the
community sorting process
that are keepers for a reason.
And there's a reason why people
are handing them out and sharing
them with each other and breeding
with them.
And they've got proven results
like the TK and the Ercol
and all these different
lines that are really like
those are the baselines that we
need to keep around and need to
keep.
Keep moving through the community
so that people, you know.
It's one of those things like
scum, like we're all
everybody wants scum and
everybody.
There was a time where it was
ubiquitous and it was like
Jack Turps or Blue
Dream or cookies.
And it was just kind of like,
but that's just
weed.
And like now it's gone
and everybody wonders where the
fuck it is.
And like, you know,
I don't like Jack Turps and I don't
like Blue Dream, but like I'm
still going to be sad when they're
gone, even if
like that's not my jam.
And so like that's something
that I feel like we just.
Regardless, like fuck, I hate
cookies, but like, you know,
it's proven itself, like it's
here for a reason, like people
like it, let's keep it around.
It's like overplayed rock
songs of
like your 90s youth.
Like my six year old likes
to listen to
We Will Rock You all the time,
like Queen.
And just the I feel like
I'm like, it's a good song, but it
was so played like on
every radio station in high school
that like you
don't need to listen to it anymore.
It sounds like a jingle at a certain
point.
But then that's what's crazy, though,
is you see like, OK, I mean, that's
the same thing, like he said with
Jack Turps.
Like if you haven't been if you
haven't had them a lot like
that weed, when I first smelled that
kind of weed, when I was in my
teens, I was like, holy
shit.
Like there's still ones that
are the right ones of those that are
still some of my favorite weed.
It's just that there's a lot of them
that are really washed out and the
best Jack that's really deep
and funky and incense and
like bitter
coffee.
Like there's there there is Jack
that's the shit, you know, but
there's just so many of them that
have that washed out milky
like you're like, it's like
not even quite
terpenelein smelling.
It's just kind of like Jackie
and just like it's just weird.
You know, those are the ones that
are really bad.
But like
it's a trip because just because
you've been around it for so long
that it is not good to you anymore
doesn't mean that the people who are
just getting into that shit are
like, what?
Oh, this is amazing.
And it's like, well, why not?
You know, you still got to have
everything around because there's
there's everybody has has different
favorites and
and things.
There's certain things that wear out
on you. But initially, they're so
good. That's like a real like the
biggest hit on every album
is like, oh, that's fucking amazing.
And then like after the like like
ten or fifteen years, they're like,
dude, that other song that nobody
likes is the fucking good one
or the one that a lot
of people like, but you thought was
bullshit. Like it turns out
like, oh, that's like shit.
That one is really good.
I see why people like it so much,
you know,
that's how it is.
Like you got to have them.
I feel like a lot of bands,
I like stuff that they did before
they got big, like ZZ Top,
the stuff that they were
doing before they popped.
If you listen to some of that,
you're like this stuff's amazing.
But I'm not like a huge ZZ Top
like
it got less than life.
You know, they were living
the music they had to, you know,
they were living and breathing and
sweating and putting everything
into it in the very beginning.
Then once you made it to the
or like in hip hop, like T.I.
like his early stuff was really good.
We didn't need to do it anymore.
We.
You relate things to things, too.
So you got to realize, like when
you when you hear
a song, it's like got this
vibe if you don't know who
they are and you know that like
this is just this thing and it's
like, you know, it's like esoteric.
You're like, what the fuck, you
know, and you hear it and you're
like, damn. And then after a
while, like, you know who
it is, you've seen them,
you've heard it, you hear it on
commercials for cheesy shit.
And then after a while, it's like
you relate it to that and you can't
there's no way to figure out
if it's like you don't like it
or you just don't like what you
relate it to.
Like it's the soundtrack for
some bullshit.
So now it's bullshit.
And I think that's what happens a
lot with like a lot of things that
are like strains that get really
popular or they're hyped.
Like you go like like like
sunburns, like I hate cookies
and it's like, yeah, but if like
your experience with cookies
was that you got it from this
fucking dude who showed up at some
crazy party at someone's house
at three in the morning when you
were shrooming and shit and you
were like, fuck, look at the resin
and you're like, you're like, fuck,
this is far out and you smoke it.
You're like, oh, shit, OK.
And then like if that was what you
related it to, it'd probably be
different than when weed shows
up and everybody's like, this is
number one.
This is the shit.
You've got to smoke it.
And it's all over fucking
everything.
And it's like it's like commercial
and you're like, fuck, I don't
know, like some of those ZZ Top,
if they would have been the first
ones you heard before,
you might have been like, oh, no,
this is the shit.
And it might have fit right in with
the other stuff.
But your brain is naturally
hard going to hardwire those things
into being like that's
fucking a cheesy commercial
for fucking pantyhose and shit
like I don't want to
fucking listen to this bullshit,
you know, but it's trippy because,
you know, you did.
There's no and there's no way to
figure it out.
Like I always said, like one of the
best fucking drugs you could ever
get. Like if you people like want a
drug that does this or they do this,
give me a fucking drug that
makes me be able to hear a song
again for the first fucking
time.
I would fucking do that shit like I
would be a fucking just cracked out.
You know, I'd be like, oh, fuck, I'd
be making like the playlist and being
like, dude, give me back that one.
Like your brain just, you know,
releasing fucking dopamine because
it's the groundhog day drug.
Yeah, it's weird.
That's how we do this, too.
Like now I smell Urkel and I'm like,
hey, it smells like perfect.
It's good. Sweet.
It's got a candy smell.
But when I first fucking smelled
Urkel, I was like, holy
shit, it's fucking artificial.
Fruit flavor.
It's fucking fruit
loops, Flintstones, vitamins,
skunk, nasty, crazy candy.
I'm like, how the fuck this is.
This shit can't be real.
This is fucking insane.
And now I can smell it and I'll be
like, is this the real one?
And after and then I'll be like,
it's almost like if I smell a blind
and I don't know it's Urkel, I'll
smell and go, this is really good.
The fuck is this shit?
And then someone's like, it's Urkel.
And I'm like, oh, fuck, it is.
But it's like, oh, it's Urkel.
I'm like, yeah, it's fine.
Urkel, I don't know, it just sounds like some shit.
You know, your brain does weird shit
when it gets used to things, you know,
it's crazy.
OG's like that, too.
I smell OG now and I'm like, fuck,
because now I have like I've made
really good seeds where they're all
OG and I'll be like,
they're good, it's OG.
And then I'll like and then I'll be
like, fuck, I guess it's pretty
cushy. And then I'll like smell the
real fucking verified clones and I'll
go, oh, yeah, this
it just smells like this is what OG
smells like. It's not that crazy.
But the first fucking time you smell
OG, you're like, damn, that's
pretty fucking wild right there.
Like, you know, it's a trippy thing.
It's weird.
God, no.
I'm I finally got
some OG's
in flower.
It's been a long time. We got a lot of
OG here in SoCal, man.
We lived OG
this way, sideways and backwards,
and at a point it was like fucking
just it's just complete madness.
You know, but in the beginning.
There was fucking there was OG,
you know, there was real OG, just
like what you're talking about, you
know, and I finally
got a hold of the real OG,
you know,
old Kev hooked me up, so
I finally got it got
all ready to roll and
a couple of couple of things going
on. So we're going to put some put a
couple of those in the flower this
year. So it's going to be nice,
you know, get that real OG back.
You can do some work with that son
of a bitch.
She nice.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
It's a strong
shit to like, oh, gee,
I've never been able to have a GB,
my favorite weed, because when I
smoke a lot, I like to really
smoke and smoke
and like, oh, gee, it's just
like, you know, people like, oh, no
fucking baby lungs.
I'm like, well, even if
you're really smoking hard, like
and you're smoking fatties, you smoke
like, oh, gee, like you smoke
a fatty. You're like, cool.
Like I fucking smoked one.
You know, it's not like some of that
weed. Like when we were smoking
perfect, you could roll.
You could just roll another one,
roll another one.
It tastes like you just keep
smoking, smoking,
you know, like with OGM, like I
smoked one already.
Like I'm good for a minute.
You know, I don't need to smoke.
Yeah.
You know, at least fucking half
hour or some shit because
it's just thick.
It's like it's it's some thick
shit, you know?
Yeah, man.
Yeah.
Just cool.
If you only get out a little bit of
weed, I think that's why all those
ones are the most popular.
You got a little sack of people who
are buying on the street.
You're buying a fucking eighth or
fucking grand.
Yeah. You're like, cool, I'm good.
You know, I can put this on the
phone or the pipe, you know, small
time smokers like shit.
OK, cool, because you're getting
your money's worth, you know, but
so I always like to really
smoke to break those up in the
little cellophane.
So, you know, the cell
that you get back.
Oh, yeah.
You know, the point eight years, you
know, whatever.
You know what I mean?
Eyeball grams to break down.
And that's what's the jump
the damn high school football fans
during the game and shit at halftime.
So I guess many of them suckers, we
can't bro.
What you need is the ice cream man,
homie.
Jump over the fence, jump the fuck
back over. Everybody knew he was
coming.
As soon as the band started playing,
I got this check underneath the
fucking bleachers.
Homie bone in the homie case,
he was done and he there with fucking
goddamn solar fans full of fucking
nerve and fucking
fanning bags.
We used to take bets and see like a
regular old sandwich bag.
Like how many how many squares
regular sandwich bag, you know?
Yeah.
Oh, man, we're kids.
Yeah, dog.
Old school, man.
Oh, yeah.
Moving all kinds of shit.
We're fucking we're we're pushing
the grape rack and fucking and
fucking some fire OG back in high
school.
That's which is a I just got that
fire OG cut back to me.
That's beautiful.
Which I'm stoked on.
I'm stoked on that one.
That's one to me for smoking like
that's one of those ones.
If I smoke it when I'm drunk, like I
come home and I would like go,
I would go out, you know, to the show
or some shit and come home and be
hella buzzed and roll up the
fire OG and fucking start smoking
it and be like, OK,
this is fucking thick
in the chest.
It would kick me, you know?
That's what I'm working.
I'm going to work with the fire,
the triangle, the ghost.
Those are three I'm putting in
the rotation right now, and I'm
going to put in one of the triangle
S1's from fucking CSI.
I want to see what it does next to
the real triangle.
Yeah. See what kind of stuff comes
there.
It would be awesome to have them all
in the same all in the same
situation, like right next to each
other.
They will be there.
I got them all right now, so they'll
be there. All that shit.
Yeah, that'd be sick to
see him like side by side, side by
side.
You know, yeah, they're definitely
going to put them next to the Kim's
also.
I'm going to put them next to the
Kim D, the Kim 91, the Kim
for the triangle, the fire,
the ghost and all those
are going to get put in the same
garden. They should all be within
a few feet of each other.
I'm not going to do big ones this
year. I'm going to do a lot of
smaller ones and some breeding.
So what I want to show is those
plants grown next to each other.
They're all verified cuts.
That fire I worked with for 15
years myself, so I know
that plant like the back of my hand.
I love that plant.
I've ran the ghost plenty
of times.
That's a cut that I got from
Kev over there. That's one I
actually I've already done a back
cross with.
That's one right.
Let's see right here.
That's the ghost of Boneyard.
It's a ghost cross to
ghost and Kim
Dog Special Reserve number four
that Kev works with.
That's number four male.
He has out of that cross.
He says there's nothing but fuel.
And from what I've made in the
crosses, that's what comes out of
that cross. It's it's
it's dominating in OG's
that come out of everything,
especially this ghost cross.
I want to try that same male to
the triangle and see what comes out
of there.
And then I might do some reversals
with that fire across to some of
these cuts to see what I can find
in those fire to triangle fire
to ghost.
How close is fire?
How close is the ghost look into
that?
I mean, I have yes, but
there.
I mean, is that like
like how much is that?
How much is that like is a fucking
rename, you know, from
like or environmental
differences or
the same plant in my garden?
They're not the same plant at all,
man.
In my garden, they are not the same
plant. There goes to so much
more finicky,
hard to clone.
It stretches different, has
different branching than that S.A.V.
Mine come from the same source,
just the same as you.
I mean, I guess what you would get
that I know the ghost came from the
same cat.
Yeah. So they
they aren't the same.
They at all.
That's what I'm trying to show with
everybody on here. That ghost and
the triangle, the ghost and
the fire, the
S.A.V.
I wish I could have that towel and
the alien back. Those are two I lost
when I lost my leg.
I had so many different OGs that
I wanted to show together because
of all the
all the misinformation
and the yeah, I've
got the topanga here to the topanga
grows very similar in structure to
the triangle, the ghost, the S.A.V.
The structure on those is very tall.
What I call Viny, the plant wants to
grow with branching that goes up
instead of out.
The ghost has a little bit more
out than up.
That's what's different on the ghost.
The ghost has more of a what I call
a Christmas tree style and structure
compared to those other OGs.
It really isn't when you put it next
to plants that do have that
structure, but next to the panga
next to triangle next to fire, those
all try to grow vertically up.
They can't support theirself when
they're growing, when they get into
flower, they want to break their
branches off no matter what indoors
they're going to just snap off and go
fucking stupid on you.
You're going to be pissed at week
seven because you lost all this
fucking nerve that you forgot to
fuck them.
I'm serious. It's I had that OG
that fire for so long that
I used to kick myself on the nuts
when I got lazy just for not doing
that because I'd get to that time
and there you go.
The branches would start to bend
over like fucking rainbows and shit.
And you're like, what the fuck, man?
You dumbass.
You should have put the trellis up
or do something.
Now I'm in there with fucking 45
bamboo stakes, looking like I'm
in some kind of fucking bamboo
jungle.
I'm going to put my eye out and shit
with this shit.
But after a while, you just get
lazy when you throw it in a room
because I always had that in a room
no matter where I was at, even when
I was consulting in my club when I
had because I used to run to 10
different gardens to my club,
depending on my owner's
club, the two guys that worked
there's garden, the gardens that I
ran and every one of them had some
fire in there for
me to have the smoke as part of my
my payment of what I'm doing, like
especially if I'm working for a
veteran senior, they can't pay me.
So when I'm coming over there to show
them how to cycle through nutrients
and set up their system and all this
shit at the end, I'm like, just give
me an ounce of the fire.
That's all I want.
And I'll come over here anytime you
need me. You can call me 24 hours a
day for troubles, all that shit
that I just need some of that herb
because for me, I've had
a fire. Oh, gee.
And a lot of people are going to
doubt it, but I had it since
so far back, I can't even fucking
remember, man.
I got the cut in 2003
and I've been smoking that prior to
that for a long time.
And it's just the herb like you guys
are talking about. It brings back
memories for me.
It's always a good memory.
So it's it's me with my friends.
It's me at a concert.
You know, it's fucking
all the best times I ever had with
cannabis came with that
plan. It was always next to me when
for some reason I always had a
quarter pound of fire on me in the
car.
It's in my jacket.
It's in the backpack.
Wherever I go, if I'm showing up,
that's what I brought because
places I'm going, that's what we're
doing. Like the homies are going to
show up with the herb.
That's all we want to show what
we're doing.
Nobody shows up with no fucking
bammer ass weed anymore.
Nobody's smoking brick weed.
We know what's up.
So I had a lot of homies
that were starting to push
a lot of herb medicinal
like you guys were talking about
Dennis Perrone.
I started in ninety six with his
club, the the
cannabis buyers collective.
We used to push cannabis
through there for the patients.
We sold it to them cheaper, gave it
to them.
I ended up coming up here when
cannabis went legal.
We did the same thing here and up
here. That's that's one of the
plants we used to give to people.
It was always on the top shelf.
People always wanted it when
it wasn't purple.
It was no G.
And when you wanted OG, you were
with SFV or with ghost
or with triangle, you're with fire,
you're with Tahoe.
You might be with Larry.
All those are going to give you OG.
They're going to give you different
structures.
But when you want the long
length, you shit like this.
That's the triangle right here.
She's a long, lanky girl.
She's just going to keep on
stretching up.
And you can see my career,
these these branching go up.
They always want to go up instead
of out on this triangle.
It's just part of that.
Oh, gee, she needs to have
support up and down.
She she's going to handle a
lot of topping, top the shit out
of her and spread her out and let
her grow you as much
spears of goodness that you can
handle. But use it for breeding,
man. That's what I that's what I
love the OG is for for breeding.
I like trying to shrink
them down, them tall, lanky girls.
They need to have their structure
fixed through different kind of
breeding.
And like Sunburn was talking about
earlier with the 88G13, that's
a plant that you could use on a
triangle to get the structure
slightly down to retain terpene
profile that's in that plant
because it will offer to that.
There's a plant I've used before to
breed with also that 88G13.
And I've done a few crosses that
plant.
You can find some spectacular
crosses that come out of that thing.
And I love that
88G13, especially the
terpene profile that can pass
through it when you do get those
nice ones.
So it's kind of like a meaty,
earthy,
like food with the Ross that I
used to the Rastafarians I used to
breed for up here.
I had some friends that rented a
house for me.
His name was Danny.
I mean, he introduced me to a whole
lot of other Rastafarian
artists and I used to breed for him.
And that was one of the lines they
always wanted me to put into
some of the crosses that they had
was that 88G13 because they always
said it tasted like food to them.
It was like stew.
That's we want that in our in our
herb. That's the kind of
it's same thing.
That's the memory that they got from
herb. That's what they remember.
It's it goes back to
their childhoods, man, like not
not like kids, but like teenagers
like us, our childhoods all
when we all started smoking the herb,
what you started with is what takes
you back and makes you want to
continue to go down that path.
For some reason, it's
it's like the shoes you wear and the
music you listen to when
that's what's the feel good part of
your life. It's easier to turn
that switch on for you to go there.
It's kind of a bias for
us all. But, you know, it's
true. It's OG's
turn that shit on for me.
You know, old school rap like Peter's
time, man, that's
that's my thing.
That's what I used to listen to.
All those kind of things.
You put me to some fire OG and
let me listen to some old school
public enemy or some shit.
I could chill out all goddamn day
or put on some punk rock because
that's what else I used to listen to.
And that's the kind of stuff I'm
headed to, man.
Give me some killer ass herb that
makes me just want to kick it with
the homies with a
chill ass vibe.
And the more I recognize
that or the more I'm able to get
to that position, the more feel good
that happens for me.
And I think it's the same way for
everyone. I mean, the search and
herb is great, but if you could
get that same herb that you first
started with, it's kind of
the euphoria that comes from that.
It's crazy, man.
It's crazy, man.
That's the old
San Diego Bull Rider was like one of
my favorite weeds of all time when
we were when we were youngsters
running around and
there was the last couple of batches
before it disappeared forever.
It was really seedy
and everybody was complaining about
the seeds in the batches.
And they were all getting their
money back, you know, and
getting refunds and stuff.
And it was like a whole frigging
mess.
And the the
bit that I got, you know,
whatever I collect,
I was like, damn, this is great.
We got all the seeds and and
whatnot. And
my buddy was stoked.
He saved some of the seeds out of
the batch and stuff.
And he he started
in the same way I did really shitty
as a young kid and in the drawer
and in a Ziploc bag, you know.
And now, like still to this day,
like every year
I break out that little bag of
seeds and like I try.
So new technique,
you know, and how to how to bring
those back myself.
You know what I mean?
And, you know, all the get them
tissue culture.
Yeah. So so when I got left, I'm
just going to be like, fucking,
you know, I'll finally we'll wait
for the for the labs to become
cheap. And I'm hoping that one
day we can bring that back, you
know, because that would be so nice
to go back to one of your favorite
things. You could just smell and be
like, oh, my gosh,
you should get wet patches of this
and
let it stay open.
And
it's the best.
Now, so fucking good.
And, you know, so,
you know, and then other stuff took
over and it was all good.
But going back to that would be so
nice, you know.
Oh, yeah.
Tyler on a totally
unrelated topic.
Wait, you grew up in the San Diego
area.
Yeah. For the most part, like, you
know, my my youth,
I moved here when I was 12.
So I was in Arizona, Desert
Rat. You know, my dad, you know,
hated it in the desert, left
the fire department.
We're going to we're going to
California to change our life, you
know.
OK, so fashion question.
Yeah.
And like junior high, high
school in the San Diego area
was turquoise a big color?
Like we're vibrant colors, big
color.
I mean, in the SoCal
like early 90s fashion scene,
huh?
And like the SoCal early
90s, because I have a friend.
Yeah. Late 80s, early 90s.
Yeah. It was huge.
Yeah. OK, there we go.
I'm trying to tease that out now
because I have a friend from high
school from San Diego and I grew up
in Boston and he
was like, why did you guys
let me wear it like we're all on
this group text?
And he's like, why did you guys let
me wear the clothes I wore in high
school?
And those are the colors, man.
I was like, I just kind of assumed
that was like the SoCal style
and I wasn't going to
turquoise going to judge you for it.
It was it was no man.
It was everybody had like
oh, it's that color, man.
That's kind of why my colors are
that way.
There you go.
That's my high school years, man.
Those are the colors on my fucking
seat covers.
It's like one of a fucking one
of them nylon fucking skiing
jackets and shit.
They're fucking neon blues
and fucking pinks and shit.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh, yeah. I got a picture of my
brother and one in my phone here,
probably exact same fucking color
way as these fucking cards.
Now that you guys say that, but
the we're talking like nineteen
eighty six to about nineteen ninety
three, maybe with that color way.
Bam. Lots of triangles and digital
patterns and shit.
Yeah.
People talk about the different
the different decades, like the
70s or the 60s or the
80s.
The 60s is really like the end
of the 60s and the beginning of the
70s.
Right. The 70s is really like the
end of the 70s and the beginning of
the 80s and the 80s
is really the end of the 80s and the
beginning of the 90s.
And that's a generation that's
looping right now.
So right now we're like going back
into the 90s.
You go back. Yeah.
That's why all of a sudden now you
see like tie dyes.
And I've already been saying this
from a while back.
Everything's in a 30 year cycle.
Right.
Yeah. Like fashion and all that
shit.
So like so like it just
it just we're just getting past
those colors right now.
Like all the like the
the the the bright day glow
and the bright orange
that shit getting phased out.
And now we're going like into tie
dye shit, you know, and I'm waiting
for like the fucking for
like the 60s.
It's going to flip back.
The 60s came back in the Hawaiian
shirts.
Yeah. Because there is no.
You got to see the 60s.
Shit's going to be back now.
The 60s. Yeah.
These are right now.
Yeah.
And the outliers of that shit is
the 50. You got the guys
that dress up like they're from the
50s and shit like the gangs in New
York and shit. They're the outliers.
They won't really come back, but
they're always in there.
And that was the 80s.
So in the 50s, yeah.
And that's what I realized.
Like, oh, shit.
Once I came.
So when I was growing up, it was
like we're in the 80s and it was
like the 50s was the shit.
I was like dirty dancing and all
this other shit.
That's all.
It was the greasers and the
socials were the shit in the
80s. Right.
And then it got to
be the 90s.
And then it was like, all right,
fucking everything.
That was like the early 70s
and the 60s.
Yeah. That was the shit.
And that's why in the 90s,
everything was like all shrooms and
acid. And that's like what I was
like old enough to party.
So it was the shit.
And then then it like went
went further.
But like I got a theory
that now because
all that shit happened when it
was like hard for trends to
actually like really
get to the mainstream.
So it was like it could all be
kind of controlled and like
and get out in a certain way.
Right. But now, like, there's the
Internet.
So I think that like this wave
you're about to see where the
60s and the 90s loop is
hitting right now.
As soon as we get past that, you're
going to hit the Internet era.
And once you hit the Internet era,
what's going to happen?
The Internet here is going to come
back again. It never went away.
Right.
So now all the shit's going to be
fucking cool forever.
There's not going to be waves
anymore. It's going to be like
fucking 80s is still cool.
60s is still cool.
The 90s is still cool.
And you see it, too, with like the
hallucinogenic and all that shit.
It's like they're going to be able
to get rid of it because it ain't
the 60s and the 90s.
And now it's like the Internet
era. So it's just going to be
shrooms for fucking ever.
You know, it ain't going to be like
it went away all the way till now
because it did.
It was for a while in the 90s.
If you're out in the 90s, you're
like, dude, I get a sack of
micro dots.
I get a shit fucking name.
I get a sheet of black pyramid with
the gold flake.
I can get fucking sheets
of the fucking crazy fucking
Buddha and Ganesh fucking
art acid on the dope blotter
and all that shit.
And then for a while, it's kind of
like, damn, who got the acid?
Who got the shrooms?
Like shit's kind of gone.
And then now you see it all really
come back. I don't think it's ever
going to go away now.
You know, it's not going away
now. Yeah, you're true on that.
It went with my
with my daughters.
I like to like play.
I'll do a Pandora where it'll
just kind of like play stuff
that's related.
And I'll go a full week where
I introduce them to like.
You know, 50s
soul music or like
six like, you know, like 80s
pop or reggae
or whatever.
And like for a full week, my two
year old and my six year old
will just listen to that with me
nonstop.
And then sometimes I go to like
shit I never listen to.
I'll be like, we're just going to
binge on Katy Perry and
like all the the current
pop music.
And they like go nuts for it.
But they love the other stuff, too.
And I love the idea of like
introducing them to a bunch of
different things.
Yeah, it's a trip.
I just put on the 50s channel
for my my kids, the music
from the 50s and we went through it.
You know, like this is this is what
they listen to.
This is bad shit.
There's some bad shit.
You know what I mean?
This is this is some bad
shit. My wife, you know, she's tough
to please, but she'll listen to the
50s.
What's that show?
Bad ass.
She never does.
It was a good time.
So, Jackson, someone
has persistently been asking
this question.
Lime.
So this year, I'm actually right
now, I just went in.
I took so.
So the the black line
is.
This old shit from my buddy Heath
that have the citrus in it.
And then I crossed
it with this other shit that was
like crazy chemical funk,
gnarly, like,
like,
like it makes like most of
the gassy,
chemically shit like
that.
It makes it all look kind of tame.
It's like the nastiest ones are
like, damn, that's nasty.
Like you can get like ones
that are a lot like Chem D
or when I'm at the stage
it was at when
I had made it like through drifting
for through breeding over the years
and drifted to be more like the
straight northern lights.
And then with some of the more like
chemi stuff.
But when I made line, it was like
that crazy, like
eucalyptus, really
just like like crazy chemical
nasty shit.
So.
That was that.
And then I crossed that with that
PK and then
then out of that initial cross,
I got the line one clone that I've
kept ever since.
So now I've had that for like 11
years or something.
And so.
I took the line one and I read it
with its brother.
And then out of those seeds, I
planted those, those I called line
one cross line because it was just
the line smelling male that year.
I had line one cross tallest line
one cross line.
And those are the ones I messed
around with.
And so I
have line one cross line.
Yes. Out of that is where I got the
mail that I call line pop.
And then
that mail I kept and I did a bunch
of different stuff with it while I
had it.
I bred it a couple of times.
The same male clone.
I bred it back to line one.
So one of them was like a winter
breeding. One of them was
over in some bushes.
One of them was on a big plant.
All the same cross, though.
But I have like different batches
from different times.
And then that
was the one where it was like line
pop was like the one where when you
smell it, the whole plant just
smells like a line popsicle.
When it was all the way flowered out,
it got some resin and it had it.
I think of like orange enos in it
because it just has so much
limonene in it.
And that's like what the real smell
of that turp is when you have that.
And so it was like a little bit of
orange on the actual flower.
It was a resinous male.
And then.
Yeah. And that was given to me as
OG toad.
And and when I asked them,
they're like, oh, it's like SFB.
It's platinum.
It's, you know, and like
a while later, I talked to
my buddy who's part of the same
crew. He's all. No, that's the that
cut that is in that crew.
That's the one that
that the cookies dudes use for
shit. That's called the flow right
up or the Florida.
So that's really not SFB.
But when I asked the dude initially,
my buddy glide, he's like, oh, dude,
it's yes, SFB.
It's platinum.
You know, it's it's OG, bro.
It's OG. And I was like, cool.
So I was like, OK, it's SFB.
And then.
Later on, my
buddy, Frost Boss,
from kind of the same group down
there, he was like, no, dude,
that's that was the that's the
Florida.
And I was like, OK, cool.
And so that's what that really
is. So you can revise that tag.
I think I probably only gave those
to you in Kingston and
and probably
yes. And some big because
those were that those were
those were what those are what
Limepop pushes.
That's that cross right there.
So those are Limepop push up once.
But the Limepop push, when I put it
out, I worked it to F3 to
be like kind of even mix.
Yeah. So.
So so so the line
popsicle, I did that one and then
I did.
I did want to try to keep everything
in the mix because the line popsicle
mail was a little more rangy
and it was leaning back to the
heaths. But it had
the the kind of cushy
structure.
So I was like, all right, I don't
want to leave everything that way.
So I want to do some more while I
still have these fresh F2
seeds.
So out of another
pop, I kept three
males that were the really broadly
limey smelling ones.
And I took those and I put those
on the lime one, too.
So right now I have the lime one
cross Limepop and I have the lime
one cross three boys.
And out of those, I'm
going to use those to
make back cross two
seeds where it'll
be
where it'll basically be
mostly lime one, but with
the influence of those different
things.
So.
The lime one had everything
that was really desirable out of
the black line.
It was like it had this it has this
woody lime peel
lime popsicle smell, but
it has like the heavy, crazy
eucalyptus deep
chemically funky
earthy
thing to it.
So like that's the clone
that after and I
had out of that F1
I had like seven different lines.
I had what I called short
lime.
These are the siblings of lime one
out of the lime one out of the
black lime cross pique.
I have the short.
I had one, two, three and four.
And I had what I called clone.
So.
So really six.
And out of the short, there was
cool stuff, but not as good as
what came out of the one out of
the four. There was cool stuff,
but not as good as what came out of
the one.
And then I tried stuff
out of clone and
those are really consistent,
but they're like a lot
more hard to trim and all the lime
stuff is not like a trimmer's dream.
It's kind of pokey
and and, you
know, like if it was an
OG, it would be like fire
OG, not like
not like the Florida, like some
some weed is round and some weed is
pointy and it's more of the pointy
kind of stuff.
But those seem to usually be better
weed when it's a little pointy and
not round for whatever reason,
because it smokes better.
I think it better places for the
resin to grow, like something about
the structure or,
you know, just there's something
there's some kind of connection
there that seems to be fairly
fairly consistent.
It's not always like that, but.
So I did those,
I'm working with those to make those
back cross two seeds because
those were back crosses.
And then and those are
inbred.
Then I had some really cool ones.
I had a buddy of mine hit me up and
he's like, hey, our buddy, he
he he has these lines,
you know, and I was like, well, what
is what does he have?
And he goes, oh, no, it's just black
lime. And I was like, when did
he get it?
Did he get it before I had crossed
it to PK or
did he get it after?
And he just like got it through a
couple other people.
And he was like, oh, no, he said
he's had me found them.
They say black lime.
So I planted them and
I can't tell if their original black
lime and there was a guy who had
grown some indoor and they had
seeded themself.
I can't tell if they were those,
which I kind of thought so
afterwards or if they were something
else. But I planted them.
I think I got 11 plants
and they were all girls.
So you would think, well, they must
have been the ones that had seeded
themself because it's like femme
seed or herm seed,
really. But, you know, they were all
they weren't herms when I grew them
out, but they were could have come
from that, from being stressed
inside.
But it's hard to know because
it'd be different if I had like 40
or 50 of them.
But 11 seeds, I've grown
11 seeds before from rags
and been like, I didn't get a male
or you grow 20
and you get one male
and then you take the same seeds and
you plant them again.
You grow 35 and you get 16
males or something, you know, like
you don't know with small numbers how
it is.
But those ones I grew
and I put them with the stuff
that is the that
is the Northern Lights oil can,
which was the father side
of original black lime.
So those ones is
those are like a recreation
of
original black lime, except
they have extra Northern Lights
oil can or what we used to call
Pog, purple, orange, green.
So those are neat, too, and I haven't
dug into those.
And I'm trying to think if anybody
else has grown them out yet.
I think someone grew them out, but I
can't remember who.
But those I call Kenny lime because
the guy who had the lime stashed
is named Kenny.
And those were like those
are promising, too, because they're
neat because they have the same
stuff, but none of the
none of the O.G.
in them. So like when you grow them,
you can see how cushy and how much
they were like in that ballpark
of O.G., but they're not O.G.
at all. They're just like that same
nastiness, that same crazy
quality of thick resin and
and really deep chemical
earthy funk.
So those ones
I want to dig back into.
But right now I already have the lime
lime one cross lime pop.
Those are bomb. The lime vine.
I already have the lime one cross
lime pop and the lime one cross
three boys going and I'm going to
breed them forward
with the males.
And then when I do those breedings,
I'm going to throw the line one
in with them to do that, to make the
line one back cross twos
that are inbred back crosses
because I released a line one back
cross. But I had used the grape soda
skunk as the as the
donor in that.
And that was just.
That was just trying, you know,
trying something cool and
the grape soda skunk was kind of
cool because it it made
some of them get pretty chunky and
it's more frosty looking than
the line, like it's more visibly
resinous because as that little
bit of white widow in it and.
So those are those ones
were cool. So the line one back cross
I put out as
the grape soda skunk, but the ones
I'm growing now are are just
PK black line and then
I'm going back to the line
one again so that so I might wind
up putting out some line one back
cross twos.
And then I'll do some more.
And then this year I have the lime.
I did the line one cross line pop
and I bred that forward all the way
to so that's F1 is line
one line pop is F2.
So I took those
I took the seeds out of that and I
bred those forward to F5
and I got really cool ones.
Yeah, those are the that's out of
that is where I pulled the mail
to put back on to the line one
serve and await.
Yeah, and so.
So.
I'm trying to think of what the fuck
I was saying.
Where was I?
Was I talking about their.
The lines.
Lines.
Lines.
I know we're talking about lines.
I just can't remember where I'm
talking about.
Oh man.
Oh the line.
So the line that five.
So I so this is the last
readings I did.
I took the line that fives
and I had
some tech do some out inside
and he found two that were really
nice, one that was really limey
and one that was really like the
deep, funky kush
with the lime with the lime
popsicle edge to it.
And so
after he did those, I took the same
seeds he grew out and
I grew some myself
and I gave him at fours.
They were killer.
So
a lot of times people test things to
see if they're good to release.
I tend to test things to see if
they're good to keep breeding
forward.
So like he I have
the F4s I give them to skunk tech.
He grows them.
They're killer.
I'm like, all right, well, I'm going
to take the F4s and
make F5s.
So then out of those F5s, I
took a pair of really nice males
and I put them on sour,
sour, dub
Tahoe.
One of my one of my nice
lines that came out of the line,
one cross three boys that I cloned
years ago.
And
a cherry line that
leans really hard to the line side.
That's just really killer.
And.
I mean, a whole bunch of other ones,
Williams Wonder cut that I
got from Skunk Tech that was really
nice and citrusy and
chunky and fast.
And so those are probably really
cool.
Those all those different things,
those are all in testing right now.
Some of them are about to get
flowered.
Some of them are are
are just getting planted.
And so that's a whole project
there. So all the out crosses
and then I took the.
The line at five and I put it on the
line one.
So that's like a distant back cross,
but it's still a back cross
because it shares one of the
original parents way back.
That's still you know, it's still
a it's still a back cross, but
it's not a direct, you know,
it's not F2 back to F1.
It's F5 back to F1.
So that's kind of a cool way to do
it, too, because you've kind of
really narrowed down
a line to be one thing and
then you're bringing it all the way
back to something that has
everything. So it's like I
can predict that a little bit
easier.
What will happen and
then.
So that's like what I'm doing right
now, but I'm also this year
pulling out a bunch of other
different line lines
that are all pure and going
through to try to get some
different cuts to keep and
and different males to put
on the line one to make
odd roundabout crosses,
some of them that won't be true
back crosses because they come from
other mothers in the F1 that
were sisters on the line one.
And.
But they actually all
come from the same male, so
technically they're they're they're
weird back crosses, too, because
they they do share that same
original parent.
But I'm just doing
all those different ones and.
You know, that's like with those
kind of things that I really like,
that's the kind of stuff I do, like
for years I've been planning all
these different weird F2s
out of the lines and like taking
them in different directions.
So I have like all these different
F3s and F4s in all
different ways. And then, you know,
you take a whole grow and
see like, OK, what is this one
look like out of line clone?
What does this one look like out of
line for what's this one look
like out of line one?
See what they all kind of do.
Figure out what's the best
candidates to pull males to go
back here.
What's the best one to actually put
effort in to go forward and find
something cool?
And so that's what
I do with things like lime, jarro,
root beer,
grape soda, skunk, pina, things
that I really like.
Like I'll just fuck with them like
that a lot and see
where things really are.
And then so then by the time
you see something is like a
back cross to it's actually like
six years of checking stuff
out or by the time something's
at F2 or F3, it's actually
years and years to be like, OK,
that's where I want to go with it.
Because if you have the seeds, you
can just keep trying them and learn
what they do. So with the lime,
that's what I'm doing is just
keeping,
looking through and trying
different stuff and then trying the
out crosses and stuff.
So,
you know,
a whole bunch of lime.
Jackson, how about the
the big Fino hunt
that Bam's doing with the sky
cuddlers? Have you been keeping up
with that?
Yeah, he went through all
of it from seed.
They had a little bit of delays.
So stuff got kind of some of them
got stunted and
you couldn't get quite a good
picture because he knew everything
wasn't done perfectly.
So he's totally a monster
and he basically cloned all the
girls. I think there's like a
thousand or eleven
hundred or something girls that he
got out of those.
He called them all and he's running
all the girls a second time
because when you run things a first
time like this last year, I had a
I have a clone I keep called Wild
Strawberry. That's a cherry limeade
F1 number four crossed
with a seed that came out of
it. So it's a back cross,
inbred back cross like I crossed the
number four with its brother, got
those, took a male, put it back,
grew those.
And out of that, I got this one
called Wild Strawberry.
That's how a killer.
And it was really good weed,
but it will never fucking produce
like and I haven't grown it that
much because as soon as it doesn't
it doesn't produce that much
initially, you try it again.
It doesn't produce that much again.
You're kind of like, all right, it
tastes too good.
I'll keep it as a clone.
It's really easy to grow, clone,
clone, grow, clone, clone, and just
keep it around a couple of fucking
little pots, you know.
And so
finally I grew it the last time I
grew it. I just fed it like.
Kind of kind of made the dirt
way too hot in a sense,
which is some like all purpose dry
amending, boom, do it
up, you know, even numbers
and decay and just fucking
see what the fuck it'll
do. And I almost killed
it. And I did the same thing with
this root beer back cross to clone
that I have that was real gassy.
And I grew up and they
were like really big producers.
And I went, holy shit.
And I had almost killed them only
because they didn't produce.
It was like, well, I got the taste.
They're really resilient.
They're really dank.
They're nice. They're this killer
plants. And then I was like, they
don't get that much weed.
I can get better ones.
Fucking kill the moms.
But I didn't.
And I just saved them by the skin
of my teeth. I actually had to
revege both of those moms
to be able to get those plants
back because I had kind of
and I don't even clone those.
You know, you're not going to keep
them, just kill them.
And then I got him
back. And so what
bamboo's doing is taking all
of those and running them a second
time so he doesn't make that
mistake.
And it was cool to see
him do it because it's funny when
you if you release seeds,
I released Sky Cuddler Kush
and a lot of people groom
and we're like, I really liked it.
It was nice.
I went to people's gardens that have
big gardens, big, beautiful
plants. The buds are huge.
Then I had a couple of people who
hit me up and were like, dude, like
a dude hit me up and he's like, I
had 16 of them.
It ruined my year.
I'm like, what happened?
Like, did they have out?
Because I'm like, that's the that's
the wild card.
Like, can someone figure out a way
to harm the shit you haven't been
able to harm yet?
Right. So I'm like, well, that's
all I could think because they're
early, they're fast, they're fat,
they're easy to trim.
They test in the mid
20s and THC.
Like, maybe you don't.
Maybe they're not your cup of tea.
Maybe you wanted something a little
bit more like ghost OG
or you wanted something a little
bit more, whatever you want
and something more, a little more
frosty looking like there's those
things about it where you're like,
yeah, it's it's good in these ways
and in these other ways, someone
might find these things lacking
in it to their own taste.
But I like the shit.
Right.
So I'm like, what the fuck?
And the guys like they just never
finished. And I'm like, they never
finished. They finished like these
things, but fast.
These are like, you know, these
are pretty easy.
60 day fucking just
like fucking done, you know,
and.
