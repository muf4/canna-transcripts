So I'm going to bow out.
I got a two and a six year old
eating dinner right now, and
I'll be back in a bit.
So, Brandon, take it away.
What's going on, everybody?
Glad to be here on another
future cannabis project episode
with Grace School.
David Relax Atmosphere
on I.G.
and Kat from Gigi
Strange.
Hey, how's it going, everybody?
I'm good.
So I guess, you know, a lot of
people are
familiar with Gorilla Glue,
it's pretty world famous.
And but a lot of people
might not know what has been going
on over,
you know, the last
couple of months.
So we'll touch on some of that.
But why don't we have Grace
School kind of kick it off
and maybe with a little bit of
history on your
involvement and
give maybe a little bit of
background information on where
you come from
and your experience with cannabis.
Absolutely.
Thanks again for
this on.
Wells Don
back in 2007,
2008,
met him through a website,
International Canna Graphic dot
com, IC Mag dot com.
And
a buddy of mine went out to
desert one day to meet him,
brought him some clips,
brought him sourdough and what I
thought was the candy.
But it was the chem sister and
a couple other plants.
And we just went to, you know,
go hang out and, you know,
share clones.
And it was at a time
when, you know, it was still
loose lips sink ships.
So, you know, it was kind of
kind of crazy going out to go meet
someone.
I was glad it was like two hours
away.
And and he was
grizzled, right?
Yeah.
His handle had been grizzled and
then he had just changed it to
Josie Wells.
And it was a really
just normal day.
You know, those things you don't
think anything out of.
You're going to go give a dude a
high five and, you know,
kind of inconsequential.
All right. Cool. I was a smoke,
some bowls and drive
home. You go, fuck, I was far.
And then you stay in your house for
six months.
But, yeah, I brought
Rob that that that was crazy
at the time, that was,
you know, when O.G. was ruling the
L.A. scene, if you didn't have it,
oh, gee, you weren't getting in and
you weren't getting any money.
And with the W, you're able
to slide in and get
that top dollar.
And it was, you know, it was like
a something really cool to share
with my friends. Like, hey, man,
you know, you want to do better
here.
And of course,
you know, I gave that stuff to him.
Don't cross it, man.
Don't fucking do it.
You know, because because why?
Well, I don't know.
Don't do it.
You know, it's pretty awesome.
It's it's rather funny.
It's crazy what it's what it's
become now with, you know,
world famous
really good.
Good.
You know,
but I should probably stop talking,
though.
No, you're doing great.
Yeah.
Yeah. You know, back in the day,
I used to browse through the old
forums online, but I never actually
engaged because I was way
too paranoid.
So that's when, you know,
like you said before, it was a little
bit different. And
it was, you know, genetics made
that made everything.
It was harder to obtain, in my
opinion.
It was like a leak.
You had to be you know, you
had to be connected, you
know, with other people.
And, you
know, I actually got a hold of
a cut in, I think, late 2013
or early 2014 of the group.
We're growing it out in San Diego.
And like you said, it was great pot.
It still holds up.
It's going to be one of those things
that are going to be classic that,
you know, 20 years from now, people
are still going to be smoking on it.
It's going to be Coca-Cola.
Right. Clean it.
Right.
You know,
it's a brown label kind, you know.
Hopefully.
Well, there's plenty of brown label
kinds out there, but.
You know, you can't have a brown
label.
I'm not going to say what this is.
So, you know, for
the people who don't know what the
genetic lineage is,
do you want to go ahead and kind of
go over that with the audience?
Absolutely.
It's the Sourdouble, the
Chem Sister and
the Chocolate Diesel.
Josie, you
know, underground growers,
times when it was illegal.
So he had
a time when he had to move some
plants and
you move some plants and, you know,
when you go from one area to
another,
stuff happens, you know,
and they say,
what's that funny little thing doing?
Oh, no.
And Wes's heart,
Marduk's heart, they didn't toss
those seeds.
I would shout at them like, dude,
this is crap. This sucks.
You know, we're all broke.
We got to go get jobs or, you know,
something.
And
either they were, I don't know if
they were broke when they just
popped them or what.
So they popped them.
And not only did they pop
them, but they had enough
experience to know
what good pop was.
Because, like, you know, like it
was hard to find good pop back
then. It was hard to find good
plants for people to share.
But if you didn't know what a good
selection was or what to look for,
you didn't know what to look for.
So they had,
you know, Don was able to go, hey,
dude, this one's pretty fucking
awesome.
And that's pretty cool.
You know, a standout,
you know, a real standout.
And do it out of what?
Four seeds,
five, you know, seven
seeds, whatever they dropped.
Like, you know, you hear
stories about, you know,
the super select individuals.
You got to select them out of
thousands.
Right. Which makes sense because
you got to look at a whole
population to see who's the real,
you know, king of the jungle and
to, you know, idea king of the
jungle out of a little
tiny group and have it really be.
Is, you know.
This gorilla of a thing like.
You fucking die.
It's pretty crazy.
It's pretty crazy that, you know,
somebody who's.
You know how you can go from
having I mean, it's like
only in cannabis, you know, you
could be a home grower and
find something.
And like change the game.
I mean, you know, Don,
Brandon, you're a very accomplished
grower.
You make me want to quit.
You're fucking asshole.
It sucks.
Good job.
You're pushing the bar up, dude.
That's what we need.
That's what we need for everybody
and for the world.
And, you know, make it better.
Everyone's got to get better.
We got to bring our game up and.
I love him. Bless his heart.
Wasn't.
On that same level.
You see in the garden, you know,
it was not.
And he's looking for that fucker.
What?
Yeah, I was, you know, privileged
enough to be able to,
you know, talk to him and go
over to his house and spend time
with him and
just chop it up.
Talk about the old days and stuff.
And it's.
Yeah, it was it was great times,
man. And it
to be able to see something
like that come out of,
like, you know, home grow
the community where community
really starts at.
It means volumes.
Right. Because it has
deep roots. Right.
And and.
It's special, man, it's special for
the people that were involved in
it, special for the people that
were able to cultivate that
and benefit from it, you
support their families with it
like a lot of people, you know.
The amount of people that have
gotten exposure to that one plant.
That one plant has touched
millions of lives across
the planet and it does it
continually.
It's it's amazing.
You know, one one seed
to do that.
It's amazing the power of cannabis
and how you combine it with
with people who love it.
What can happen when you get this
really medical, really medicinal
value plant, it yields
really nice, it's fun to grow, it's
you know, kind of fun to enjoy.
Right. No one likes taking medicine
that sucks. You want to take castor
oil that, you know,
I don't like making that fucking
face.
It's.
It's pretty.
So,
you know, Kat,
you've been involved
in with Gorilla Glue
for a really long time.
Do you want to kind of explain
what like,
you know, what you are doing
and your role as far as.
Doing some of the things like.
Like, like licensing
and different like the media
stuff and kind of how
you help them through, I believe
you help them through with like
the law, the initial lawsuits
that happened in the beginning
with the actual Gorilla
Glue company.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah. I became a glorified
paralegal at that moment.
But no, yeah, I've been with
I always still say I've been with
the guys, even though they're no
longer with us physically,
but emotionally.
And right here they are
since 2015.
They brought me in.
They were two, you know, two
growers that had an idea and
they knew it was going in a
vision. They were actually kind of
ahead of their time.
Their vision of what they wanted
to do and what we wanted to kind of
do is what people are
or what people are doing today.
So back in 2015, when we thought,
oh, this would be great because
how it actually started is when
they came to me and they said, you
know, you do business operations
and marketing. And I said, yeah, I
take people's concepts and I make
them a reality.
And that's what I've always
been doing since I was 21
years old.
And so I asked them, what is
your vision and what do you want?
And they said at the end of the
day, we want each patient either
medical, recreational or somebody
that wants to just get glued to
the couch, always have the real
deal. And I was like, well, isn't
that what it is? And they said no.
One time they're up in Oregon and
they're in a dispensary and I
believe it was medicine at that
time, medicinal versus rec.
And they walked in, they had four
Gorilla Glues and they're like,
you know, looking at them, like
there's no there isn't four.
And that was in 2015.
So there wasn't four.
You know, there was only one and it
wasn't over saturated yet.
And they you know, of course,
they bought it. They walked out,
they smoked it and they're like,
this isn't what we created.
This isn't you know, Josie's like
this isn't what I made.
And it was really disappointing to
him because he knew how special she
was from the moment his shears
cutter and his hand got stuck to
his cell phone. And that's, you
know, the how the parody happened.
And it really upset him that he
knew at the end of the day, from a
medicinal or medical standpoint,
it was helping people with PTSD,
with MS and all this organic
people just thought out, fucked up
part of now I say it and he wanted
to make sure. And so I was like,
well, how are we going to do that?
And they're like, that's your job.
And I was like, well, maybe if we
can, you know, license or,
you know, find other growers that
can cultivate with us and work with
us and certify their genetics
and, you know, you know, have the
clone fairy come around and do all
these fun things. And in
our vision was there in 2015,
2016, you know, we were fortunate
to get people like Fat Panda up in
Washington and they saw
exactly what we wanted to do.
And they they believed in it
and they wanted to make sure that
their patients, recreational
medicinal had the real deal.
So it kind of took light of that.
And, you know, and and we
picked and choose.
We didn't go in, have a hundred
different quality or, you know,
different cultivators.
We literally only had like 22
cultivators at one point.
And and now it's just,
you know, now we don't have those
anymore. We can get into that later.
But, you know, at that point it was,
you know, we could have had a
thousand millions of cultivators
and there is there's millions of
Gigi for is out there right now.
But we wanted to have a select few
and those select few would
cultivate exactly to Josie's vision
and how he expected his genetics
to be. And, you know, we have the
one which is, you know, in the seven
seeds pops, we had number one, which
we call, you know, kind of the baby.
We have the number two, which was
the right. And she was actually
given over to some guy in Michigan
and he lost it, sadly.
Number three pop, but we didn't make
it. Number four, obviously, is the
legend. Number five
is we threw it away.
People think that the five that we
have currently is something.
But actually, the one in the four
make the five because that was a
stoner move of one plus four equals
five. So we're going to call that
five.
It wasn't really too hard to think
of that one. Number six didn't make
it. Number seven didn't make it.
So that's kind of how that goes.
But that was their vision.
And we really worked hard on getting
to that point.
And I remember, you know,
Josie going, holy shit, this
is this is going to work and this is
going to be a reality.
And then also we turned around and
multiple, you know, major breeders
out there were doing the same thing.
They were making sure that their
genetics were true and in
quality cultivation operations,
giving the plant to
whoever needs it.
So that's kind of where I started
in 2015.
And from there, I did the website.
I did the operations, marketing,
social media, the whole nine yards.
It was just we're the three stooges.
It was two breeders and a cat.
Anything that they couldn't do, I
could do anything I can't do.
They could do. And it was very
it was synergy.
It was it was amazing.
We had a short run,
but a really good one.
But now I got Keith.
But, yeah, I mean, I've been around
for a while and I'm not an expert
and by any means, that's what you
guys are for. I'm not a breeder.
I can take a look at your profiles.
I can take a look at the palettes of
different things and I can look at a
plant based on the knowledge and the
education that Josie gave me.
Being very, very fortunate to
talk to that man every day
up until the day before
he passed away.
I learned, you know, hands
on. I was kind of his little
apprentice and but
I know where my place is and I know
what I want to do and I do want to
keep his legacy going.
And I'm so thankful that, you know,
Josie and I had a lot of raw
conversations.
We knew he was very ill.
We didn't we didn't let a lot of
people know his last thing he ever
wanted was anybody to ever know
that he was he would consider
himself weak and he was never a
weak man. He was the strongest man
I've ever met.
And.
And he always wanted he didn't want
anyone to know he's on dialysis
every day.
That was a little funny story is
people would always say, oh, I knew
Josie, I got my cut from Josie
Wales. And I'm like, really?
Where? And they're like, oh, the
Michigan Cup in 2017.
Duh duh duh.
Well, Josie was on dialysis
during that time. He's never been on
a plane since 2013,
I believe.
So, you know, it was easy
for me to call people out when they
would say they got a genetic from
him when he was never there.
But we knew towards the end with,
you know, he needed a new valve and
he had a heart attack and, you know,
being on dialysis that long that
we had to have some really serious
conversations and, you know, loan
already passing as well.
So I asked him, you know, at the end
of the day, you gave me
a blessing and that blessing is
to keep your legacy.
And you told me what you wanted.
And but I don't know what you want
when you're not here.
You have to tell me because I can't
do it.
And, you know, that was hard.
That was hard for anybody to sit
down and tell somebody what they
want to do when they're no longer
here.
And, you know, he gave me a good
rundown. And I actually have an
Excel sheet of, you know, who
to who to, you know, who to talk to,
who not to talk to, who the holders
are, you know,
who to be friends with, but not
really friends with, you know, you
know, he gave me the whole lowdown.
And then at that time, that's when
he told me the truth about a lot
of the you know, the the history
of Gigi and and Uncle
Gray, as we call them.
I remember, you know, when we first
started talking, I said, you realize
you're an uncle, right?
And he's like, not that I was
aware of, you know, and I was like,
well, if it wasn't for you,
these girls would not be here today.
And
and but, you know, so I have
this vision. And, you know, what
Josie left me,
his vision, he left me a couple
pieces of different growers
that I was supposed to work with
right away. And, you know, I kind
of was left with a, you know, a
shit show.
Pardon how I say it, but
he passed away in the middle of a
pandemic.
You know, we're states apart from
each other. You've got to you know,
we're the our prize
and joy is a plant, you
know, trying to get her to go where
she needs to go and get everything
moving the way I need to get things
done. You can't even jump on a plane
to do this.
It was it was eight months of
absolute hell.
And then, you know, greed started
getting in. And, you know, when
somebody passes, you'll never know
who's going to knock on the door.
And there was a lot of knocks.
And one day I'm scratching
my head and going, you know,
I don't want Gigi
the legacy of Gorilla Glue
or Gorilla Glue for Gigi for
original glue, whatever you want to
call it, to become
greed and a mess.
And how do I get
the perfect breeder in?
Because I can't do it.
And ironically, seven
who I thought I had in my notes
from from Josie was Steven.
So I never found him.
Pops in and was like, hey, you know,
I don't know if you know me or
remember me. And then I was up
one night and I was going through I
read Josie's text message
to me all the time.
And it was reminding
me who brought him those plants.
And at that moment, I knew it was a
sign.
And so I called Gray the next day
and I said, you know,
I said, you know, you're an uncle.
I said that part.
But I said, you're kind of being
handed something right now.
And thankfully,
he accepted.
But, you know, what do
you say? No.
Well, actually, it was would you
like to work with me?
It was more would he even want to
dare work with me?
And and this vision isn't
mine. It's his now.
And it's what
he can he do with these plants that
we are graciously able
to bring back into our new
world and kind of evolve.
And we are who we
are now.
And we're Gigi, you know, genetics,
the Josie Wells legacy.
And our goal is to keep that legacy
going and keep all the negativity
behind us and
and move forward.
And hopefully he's proud and
give as many donations as we
possibly can to his family.
You know, she's a big part of
my daily life because I went every
day for seven
years talking to this man to not.
Now I have her to talk to what I
need. And
yeah, I mean, I can talk about my
my connection with Gigi and the
history of who I am all day long
so I can zip it now and you can ask
more questions.
But I
hope I answered your questions
right.
Yeah, it sounded great.
It gives us a lot of insight and
kind of background information
on what was going on.
You guys had to go through
like a lawsuit.
We we have the adhesive
lawsuit, the adhesive
lawsuit. Yeah, yeah.
That was pretty drooling.
Well, we didn't.
I says our individual group right
now. But the.
Yeah.
Previous Gigi.
Yeah, you know,
we we knew when I
first came with these guys and I
knew it was called Gorilla Glue for
and I said, you know, I
come from branding and marketing.
We got to change this in order for
me to put the seal of my approval
because my name is going to be
behind branding you.
We have the and we already buttoned
it up a little bit to Gigi for by
that point because everybody
shortens things down.
And the neat thing is when we
were in that lawsuit was drooling,
though.
But when we were in the middle of
it, they realized they saw how we
were transitioning away from the
word Gorilla Glue for and
into Gigi for.
So they are a little bit more
forgiving.
If forgiving could be a word of
what we went through.
Obviously, was it forgiving to our
pocket?
But yes, it was it.
He's Gorilla Glue adhesive versus
cannabis.
And that was a long
year. I was.
It was absolutely insane.
But I remember when we were
sitting down in one of the
mediations and they were trying to
ask, well, if you guys
made it in Vegas, how did it get to
the Michigan Cup?
I remember going, this isn't good.
So settlement was a good idea,
but we really wanted to fight in the
beginning.
We wanted to fight hard because we
knew if we lost,
it was going to open up
a can of worms for anybody
and everybody already.
The fact, you know, Skittles is
going through it or
you know, going through it right
now.
The fact that nobody else has really
gone through it up in that point is
because I think we
didn't push it to the point where we
lost. A lot of people said we lost
or we sold out.
But if you're in the middle of
it and you understood what these
guys, this is a federal lawsuit, too.
So it's not like it was just,
oh, we're suing you.
So if we walked into federal court,
federally, what we were doing was
illegal.
And I knew what was going to happen
to those two guys.
So we just said, OK,
you guys stay in your lane.
We'll stay in our lane.
We'll rename her to GG4.
Well, we won't rename her.
She's already GG4.
But on any packaging that we have,
we just will not reference to
Gorilla Glue 4.
And they said, OK.
And we kind of went our
separate ways.
And, you know, one of the things
that they were supposed to do is just
kind of keep up with that.
And I told them in the beginning,
this is this is a beast of its own.
It's not us.
She's a beast of her own.
I mean, she broke the Internet.
She broke the weed community.
And I can't control
what everybody else calls her.
I can't go down to Dimebag Joe
and say, hey, you can't call her
Gorilla Glue 4 anymore.
Like, I can't control that.
And they didn't understand that.
And they thought by coming to us,
we could control that.
And I wish and I felt flattered
that they thought we had that much
control, but we don't.
And so it just kind of, you know,
did its thing.
And I've learned now that
don't do that.
And I'll see a lot of the things
they were really upset that
when they would do a Google search,
we would come up first
and Josie would laugh and he's like,
well, maybe you should hire a cat.
You know, maybe that's the problem.
You know, if you really want to come up
in the search engines and, you know,
and kind of went back and forth.
And, you know, but the best thing is
that was it was hard.
I mean, we were one hundred thousand
dollars of debt on that.
And we're still paying that off
or they are still paying that off.
And I don't wish that upon
anybody in this industry.
And it's hard because it's been
the way things have been named.
You know, how does it smell?
How does it taste?
What does it remind you of?
And we come up with these
silly, funny names.
You know, grilled glue
for was just a full on parody.
And it wasn't like we wanted
to piggyback off them
because we wanted people to smoke glue.
And we we thought we could be bigger
than it and he said company.
And I don't think people called,
you know, cookies called
their their string cookies
because they wanted to be
bigger than a cookie.
It's just how the terminology was
has evolved.
But now we're we're we're legal
and we need to evolve ourselves
as my biggest takeaway from that.
It's expensive takeaway.
But the thing is, when you're
when you're big or when you have a name,
you will always be in a lawsuit.
There's no I'm learning that quickly.
There's always going to be
somebody on the sidelines.
It's probably safe to say that
if you're trying to grow
a really big brand
that you probably shouldn't use the
same name as like a candy company or,
you know, just right.
You know, blatant infringement
for marketing is kind of like frowned upon
in other fields.
And now that cannabis
is becoming more mainstream,
they're they're looking at it
more mainstream from legal
perspectives as well.
Right.
Yeah. Be kid friendly.
Got to make sure it's not kid friendly, too.
So it's taken a lot of that
that fun vibe that kind of brought us
to this before lawsuit
kind of pulling that right out of the bag.
You know.
Yeah, I.
I don't think when we started it, we figured,
you know, that's why we were transitioning.
And, you know, the hardest part was
people were using the adhesive company's logo
and throwing it on a baggie.
And I explained, I can't control that.
I can't do anything about that.
But if you look at our brand,
you know, our seal look
absolutely nothing like that.
And, you know, you steer far,
as far as where you can.
And still this day,
if you walk into any dispensary,
I mean, J.D.
says, you know, smoking Gorilla Glue
like it's legal.
I didn't see them knock on his door.
But.
And you guys, you guys
had a pretty awesome business model
when you guys were operating,
which was you guys would, you know,
hunt the best cuts of the crosses
and then you would give those out
to the cultivators to to grow out
on a licensing basis where they,
you know, where they're
clients or patients,
the people that they distribute to
would know, hey, this is exactly
where this came from.
So, you know, this is what
it's said to be, because, I mean,
we all know that people rename
stuff all the time.
It's been going down
since people have been slaying weed.
Right.
And I've had dispensary owners
admit to me that this is Blue Dream,
but we renamed it to GG4
because it's going to sell.
And I'm like, you know,
I'm going to rename it to GG4
because it's going to sell.
Yeah, no.
Well, you know, what's
really interesting is
the cut.
The cut was so popular
around like 2015 that
it almost lost value because
there would be
so much stuff
that may not even have been
that could have been completely different.
But that renaming thing was going on.
There's so many people that were growing it
at a certain point.
It got because it blew up so big
and everybody wanted it.
And then if somebody didn't have it,
they'd just be like, name something.
And then they'd be like,
oh yeah, I got I got glue.
It's just a little different,
but no, it's glue.
Yeah, a lot of things geotested.
We did a test in Oregon in 2016.
And 75% of the glue that we tested
was this thing called Voodoo Chili.
And I don't even know what that was.
And so we basically we were able to
pull it down to one clone,
you know, dispensary
that was selling clones.
And they were just saying,
oh yeah, it's the glue.
It's the glue.
But it was some cut called Voodoo Chili.
Voodoo Chili.
I never heard of that.
Yeah.
You know, someone put the
the masking tape on the wrong part.
Well, we did that.
I remember Josie and I,
because he was like,
everyone just keeps renaming the shit.
I said, let's do a test.
So in 2017, we put a picture on Instagram
and I said it was GG7.
And still this day,
I have people asking me,
you know, well, that GG7 is great.
Or do you know where I can get it?
There is no GG7.
There never has been.
We, I just put a picture out.
Cause I, you know,
phenohunt and testing right now
to see how it is.
Within probably a month,
GG7 was on dispensary shelves.
People were buying it
because they saw that
we were going to have it at some point.
And it was just like a marketing test.
Like this is what we could show
and how quickly it can be falsified.
And, and still, I mean,
GG7 is still something I get asked about
all the time in DMs.
Hey, you know, is that GG7 still around?
It was never around.
So, um, so David,
well, uh, so what's your kind of association?
Um, what, how do you get involved?
What do you got going on?
History and background?
Definitely.
Um, so it was 2018.
I saw a post from,
I think it was GG strains
and they were looking for cultivations in Nevada
so that they could back when I was there,
um, so they could do licensing
and they were just looking for people
who were interested in working with Josie and DG4.
I was just a home grower.
I sent an email to Kat or a message on Instagram
and I was like, Hey, you know, this is what,
you know, this is my name.
This is what I do.
It's how I grow.
Uh, I'm a veteran.
Uh, been doing this for this amount of time.
And I got a response back
and she said to write my story up, send it to Josie.
So I wrote up, you know, a little bio of myself,
uh, send it to Josie the next day.
And I heard back from him
probably like a week and a half later.
He said, uh, he said,
well, he didn't say that they weren't working
with small time growers.
I knew that they really weren't,
but he said, if I wanted to come by and cuts,
uh, he'd have me hold some of the things
he didn't have room for.
So I went there.
It was August of 2018, I believe is on my board.
And, uh, so I picked up the GG4,
the, uh, Funkmaster Flex GMO.
Um, that's my phone, right?
There was a sour dub cross that he gave me
as well as the Cushman's time is wedding cross,
a wedding cake cross that he had.
Um, the, the sour dub didn't last.
Um, I actually had a light fall in a tent
and snapped stock on that, on the two clones.
And they just weren't able to be saved.
He wasn't even upset.
He was like, shit happens.
Cause I was panicking.
I was like, uh, what am I going to do?
I sent him an email or a text message.
And he was like, shit happens.
Don't even worry about it.
So I was like, whew, wiped my head there.
Um, and like, when I was doing that at the time,
I had, uh, I had some stuff going on already.
Um, and I had sent him some photos of my Primo black,
which at that time wasn't the Primo black.
It was the Seattle sour push times, uh, Primo bear day
that I had gotten from frost city genetics,
Mr. Spliff of cannabis.
And I found a male in there that I liked
and I pollinated everything that was going on,
which was the meat breath by a thug pug,
um, wounded warriors breath by thug pug
and a couple of other ones.
And I was showing him what I was doing.
He was really interested in those.
I gave him some seeds, went to the house,
uh, to like, I think it was there two times total.
Um, but we talked all the time.
He was just interested in what I was doing.
And I was making sure I had the clones I could give him for,
you know, his products were going on,
but he was still sick.
So, you know, I wasn't over there as much
as I was hoping that I could be.
I really wanted to be more involved,
but he didn't let anybody know what was going on.
And, you know, home growers, we like keep to ourselves.
Um, I mean, I don't go anywhere, do anything.
I'm married to my grow like a lot of people are.
Um, and then, you know, once I found out he passed,
I contacted Kat, just let her know,
Kat and Angela, let him know, you know,
I'm here if you need me,
let me know if I can do anything for you.
I'm right around the corner at the time.
Um, and then maybe around October,
I heard from Kat, uh, told her what I had.
And we just kind of started, you know,
discussing the legacy of Josie,
uh, what she wanted to continue on doing
and, you know, what I could provide.
And what I was able to provide is recreating the genetics that,
um, he's already had out there.
So basically I don't call myself a breeder.
That's my man over here.
Um, but I am the seed producer and seed maker.
I have my own genetics on the side that I've been working on,
but still, you know, I feel like I still need 10,
20 more years for I give myself that title,
just because it takes a lot of work
and I'm in a confined space.
So I can't do a thousand, thousand plant hunts,
a hundred, a hundred plant hunts.
Um, so I just got to do it over time.
You know, we're just going to continue to create
and bounce ideas off each other
and try to keep things going
and kind of keep everybody, uh, in the industry,
you know, still thinking about, you know,
GG genetics and GG4 and what's going to come from that.
His vision is very aligned with what Josie wanted,
which is really neat.
And that's the biggest goal is
it's not about who we were in the past.
It's who we are now and how can we keep that going?
And, you know, it's, it's, it's,
it's been fun to work with Seven
who I called Steven for the longest time.
Um, but it was just so funny
because my maiden name was Seven
and people used to always call me Steven.
So I don't know if that's why I wrote it down that way.
Um, but it's right.
And I mean, he does,
he does a great job of coming up with cross ideas of,
you know, cause Josie left me all this list of,
here's what I'd like to have as crosses.
Here's what I do not want as crosses.
He really was anti citrus for some reason.
So I think we might just do one just to make him,
you know, spit on me a little bit.
Cause he's orange.
This is a little bit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, and, um, but so when I throw those at him,
he's really, you know, he's good at saying,
you know, this he's seven is good with medicinal.
He is there for the vets.
He understands he is one.
He, he gets the plant.
He loves the plant.
And, um, and it's a good,
and it's kind of nice cause I, you know,
I started out in my career in cannabis with two guys
and, and hopefully not ending my career in cannabis,
but my middle career in cannabis with two guys.
Um, but it's nice cause you know,
when you get to know you, when you get to know him,
you understand why Josie kept him so close
and allowed him in because you know,
Brandon Josie didn't let everybody in.
And it was, you know, he kept people at arm's length.
And now I understand.
And it's easy to understand why he,
he always wanted gray in the circle,
but you know, he always like race too busy.
It ever worked with us.
I always feel bad.
Cause I remember him wanting to talk to me.
He called me one day and it was raining
and I was in my shop at the time.
And it's, you know, it's a little metal shop, right?
So it's raining.
So on the roof, I couldn't answer the phone.
I was like, Oh man.
And you know how life is.
It just, that's how it works.
And then all of a sudden I'm like,
Oh dude, he's dead.
And I was like, Oh shit.
Fuck.
I know.
I remember going down the list of, you know,
cause again, like I said,
he gave me a list of who does he like,
you know, who's his close friends and his,
his, you know, I see Meg groups.
And I wanted, before I posted anything on social media,
I had to like reach out to individuals personally
and say, I need to talk to you.
And, and Gray was like, Oh, I remember.
And you're like, no, no.
And I was like, yeah.
And you're like, I was supposed to call him back.
Everything works out for a reason.
And, you know, and he's, I mean, I know he's proud.
I can feel he's proud.
It's not exactly how he envisioned,
you know, the turmoil that we've been through
and that he got to see towards the end as well.
But as long as we keep on be true to his,
you know, the genetics that he wanted to carry on,
we were, you know, the, the GG genetics term
is something that he and I thought about early on is,
you know, we've, we did that clone only,
like you were talking about and certifying genetics
to farmers, but one of the biggest gaps we missed
back then.
And what I want to do now in my next adventure
is to do more farmer to farmer seed lines
and be able to say, you know,
no, you can't have a clone from us.
No, you can't have certified genetics.
That's, that to me is not fair to these farmers.
We want to be able to, to, you know,
to fulfill an order if they want it.
And we can't obviously give somebody a hundred clones.
We don't have the room for it,
but the genetics that we do have online,
I want to be able to say, okay, yes,
let's give this to every farmer that wants it.
So at the end of the day, they have the real genetics.
And so that was kind of one of the things
Josie and I said, let's start a different adventure
and be more of a, you know,
seed to farmer line or a farmer to farmer type thing.
And, you know, that's kind of where we're,
who we are now is trying to be that
what we think is best for the community.
And that's giving back to the community
instead of trying to say, no, you can't have these genetics
or you owe us money for using the name.
It's a little bit different mindset from
the old way of, you know, hey, I don't know about that.
You know, it's, it's,
It's going back to the way he wanted it in the beginning,
which is a free for all, hand it out,
pass it out, share the love.
You got to spread the aloha.
You have to, and you don't spread the aloha.
The aloha doesn't, doesn't spread.
It doesn't, it doesn't carry on.
And it's important that it does.
So let me ask, so what are,
what are some of the things that you're working on right now?
I know you got something cooking in the kitchen.
Boiled water.
You got cooking in the kitchen there, great.
We're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're,
we're checking out everything, you know, I, I like to,
I like to know what I'm working with, you know,
so you can, you know, you want to know how everything is.
So then you can start putting it together and seeing what works.
Now you can project things.
You can't just, I mean, you can, some guys do and bless their hearts.
I mean, you know, bang, he's banging everything first run out.
You know, I mean, I kind of wish I could do that.
I just, yeah.
Well, it's funny cause I'll, you know, I'll be like, you know,
we've got the Gucci over here and I'm like, yeah, that's that bitch.
She needs to be topped all the time.
And he was like, oh yeah, no, wait till I grow it.
You know,
Gucci is going to stretch and you got to talk.
And I'm like, I was like, I don't know.
I'm going to, we'll see.
And I ended up, I flipped it like 36 inches at a couple of them.
You got three feet tall.
I, I'm lazy, lazy.
So, you know, I do a lot of toppings, you know,
it is what it is.
I, I try to be efficient with my work is how I try to frame it.
But you know, sometimes you step outside the frame.
You're like, oh, brah, it's a lot of pockets, huh?
You know, it happens, but you know, I ended up, uh, telling Pat the other day, I was like,
hey, that Gucci you said was going to stretch.
And he said, all the cultivators say they can't grow.
Cause it's so lanky.
And I was like, no, I had it stretched like eight inches in flower.
And it's like not a stretch.
It's, you know, that's what I expect.
So I'm like, hey, this thing can be, this thing can be done.
Um, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm checking that out right now.
I got a, uh, uh, fire pie, sourdough Mac,
which is one of the last things that Don put together and selected.
I got some of those going to kind of check those things out.
Those things.
That's the one I love.
And what's that fire pie, that thing on that you used in, uh, some of the crosses that,
that you did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The, the, the, the, the Joey and I did.
Yeah, absolutely.
That, that fire pie is, is a, uh, that's a great selection.
He made me that thing only came out of three seats.
You know, and that thing's a real fucking hammer and it came out of three.
You know, it's, when I talked to him about it, there's just, you know, if you just give it all
the low, all the love, right.
From the very beginning, like you don't always have to go through a thousand.
It's kind of one, you know, it's, you know, I was, I was talking to a neighbor the other
day who said a lady walked into casino through in three quarters and walked out with 175 grand.
I'm like, damn, I was like, cool.
There's the green thumb luck.
And then there's, you know, there's the, the run as much as you can to see if you can find
that winner and you're always going to have that luck.
I really think the more that I get to know, know gray, he's got Josie's luck.
Like Josie could pop five seeds, 10 seeds, and he would find one.
If not, you know, we'd throw it away or whatever.
But grace the same way he can look at something and you know, you've got to have this smell
test, the taste test, the, you know, is a yield test, this all tests.
But for some reason, these guys can pop three seeds and also next sector's got everything.
Like it's some guys, they just, some guys have all the luck.
Some guys have a, have a certain, uh, God touched them in a certain way.
And you like, like you brand, you grow all these beautiful.
It's awesome.
It's really, it's really cool.
Now, you know, like I said, it's the guys are pushing far up, you know, makes it better.
Cause like, like, bro, where we're at now here in Oklahoma, like all these people that
Oklahoma used to get all the junk from like, you know, all the junk, Hey, they got, it was
nothing, it was horrible.
And then the medical started happening in Oregon.
Some good stuff started trickling here.
And they're like, Hey, this is, this is different.
Then, you know, we show up, Oh, whoa, what is this?
You know, we're setting the, we're setting the table, setting the standard a little different
now.
You know, what's really interesting about Oklahoma is that there's a lot more cultivators
that do craft style as opposed to, you know, like California where there's larger operators,
but they all produce, you know, a larger, you know, commercial scale, you know?
So that's, it's really interesting.
But it also like with what I do, it's teamwork, man, I have a really great partners and teamwork
makes the dream work.
It really does.
But you know, what's, what's really interesting is on kind of like the licensing play, there's
different ways.
I remember I was talking to Kat before about, because I had never known, I never knew Ross,
but I knew that he would go to a lot of the facilities where they would have the cuts
and people would be growing them out so that they could do like a quality control to make
sure that these cultivators were, you know, cultivating at a standard.
Meeting a certain criteria.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Because they, you know, if they're representing a product in a brand, it needs to be consistent
across the board.
The current used to go to KFC and we get pissed if the gravy wasn't right.
Like that gravy's gotta be freaking on.
Exactly.
And so on that type of thing, what's interesting now that we are more exposed and there's been
more science available is you can look at a single plant and you can see, you know,
what it means.
And so being able to do that and add that into a type of SOP where you can say, not
only do we have a genetic, but we have, we can give you a history on the nutritional
needs of this plant that can aid you into being able to, you know, have a higher quality
consistently and have a good, you know, yield.
So you can meet those potentials and always have that available.
And I just think that's really interesting that those types of things are becoming available,
which will, I think, increase the likelihood of someone wanting to be able to cultivate
those varieties.
Right.
Most definitely.
Depending on the difficulty and what it's going to, you know, how much stress it's going
to take.
Right.
Well, you give them a roadmap and it's, dude, it's a roadmap.
You know, just follow the roadmap.
Don't go on Google and see what else you could see along the way because then it's, you know,
we're sitting.
Yeah, it's pretty distinct.
Do it this way.
You know, that, you know, you mentioned SOP, 15 years ago, could you imagine we'd be writing
SOPs, we'd be operating with SOPs and the cat on our desk.
I think it was, you were on the phone once.
Yeah.
And Ross and Dom were so funny because, you know, all these acronyms are being thrown
out and they'd always be texting me while we're on group calls.
What the hell is SOP?
Son of a what?
And I'm like, son of a what is this?
And it was every time somebody says SOP, I always think of Dom thinking, oh, is that
an SOP?
Son of a what?
A lot of people don't know.
No, well, I mean, you know, home growers back, I see makers, they don't, they weren't writing
SOPs.
They were, you know, talking from the PC.
We were with our notebooks and the notes that we're supposed to be keeping.
That was all the basis of our SOPs.
You know, some of us, we'd write notes and it'd be in our head and then we'd have it
in our head.
Just, you know.
And it's hard too.
I mean, it's neat that you say that, Brandon, about, you know, testing the plant to be able
to understand what it needs because that's so important.
You know, Dom would always say, or Josie would always say, you know, you got to talk to the
plant and let it talk to you and tell you what it needs.
And this is kind of like the same aspect of that, but, you know, at a whole nother scientific
level is, you know, testing it, figuring it out.
What does it need?
What does it not need?
Because half this crap that you guys, you know, not you guys, but people put in, you
know, they're listening to a salesman.
Next thing you know, they've got all this newts, all this soil that has got too much
crap and you're burning the crap out of your, you know, mother nature doesn't need all that.
You know, she just give her a little bit of love and see where she goes.
It needs a little more than love.
A lot of people try to give it some love.
Over love.
You don't want to over love her.
No, I mean, I'm just saying like, you know, hey.
Do you guys see that question?
Yeah.
Has the expression changed from GG4 in California to the same cut of GG4?
I don't think the expression's changed.
I mean, you know, I'd grown it in outside in Maui.
I've grown it here in Oklahoma.
I've seen it grown inside in LA, inside.
Now I've seen it inside, outside.
I've seen it everywhere.
And look, there's guys that can nail it and they do it and you're like, oh, and there's
people that don't nail it.
So does the expression change?
I mean, not everyone can bring everything to potential.
So it's not supposed to.
It's supposed to do what it's supposed to do if you hit it.
But if you don't hit it, like, if you don't hit it, it's not going to hit.
You got to do weird stuff.
You know, you got to treat it right.
You got to make sure you, you know, you don't fuck it up.
You know, you don't pull it too early.
You don't.
One of the things that I know is that the yields would exponentially increase when you
gave it support because it was one of those things that would be all over the place.
Because it's just the flop.
And then, you know, once you pull everything up and then it's all getting more light, which
was, you know, that's the whole thing, right?
We're trying to, you know, use all the light we could, especially when we were, you know,
ripping power and, you know, all illegal and all that stuff.
Like, which is cool.
Now it makes us more efficient.
You know, it's really cool.
We can use that part of our Kung Fu and incorporate it into our, you know, our style.
And, but the expression, like, personally, I don't feel like it's changed.
I feel like the glue I grew in Maui is just outside is, which surprised me, is just like
the glue that I've done here.
I mean, what do you think?
You do you think it's changed at all for you in regards to moving?
No.
You know, I personally think that there's some varieties that are pretty distinct, no
matter what.
Like, even if it's not done super well, if you've got real Gorilla Glue, you can be like,
oh, that's like, I mean, at least I know I'll be like, oh, that's glue.
You know what it takes.
You've tried.
That's glue and you did a pretty good job almost.
But, you know, it's like one of those things like the sour diesel, man, the sour diesel
that was grown out in San Diego forever.
Like, you would distinctly know, oh, that's sour D. Like, even if someone did it badly,
pulled it too early, you'd be like, oh, that's sour D.
And you're still, please, you know, sour D.
Yeah, that's an interesting question, though.
That's a good question.
Um, there was one that I saw real quick.
Somebody was asking if Gigi for really birth by accident as a mutant and breeding while
trying to shoot for a different goal.
It was an accident.
But there was no goal.
The goal was to grow.
But, you know, I hear that a lot.
I mean, not in the traditional market.
That was the goal.
Yeah.
Nothing but an accident.
But I don't know how many amazing things like post-it notes, an accident, microwaves, an
accident.
Some of the best.
Electricity is an accident.
I love my children, but they were accidents.
But I would say most of us.
Right.
You know, it happens, but it doesn't mean it's it's not it's not good.
It's not bad sometimes.
Yeah.
You know, I always think to myself when I was an accident, it was a Hermie.
It's a Hermie.
Well, every every S1 that you pop is technically.
I don't know how many people have had to experience going and writing a U-Haul in the
middle of the night.
Have to go quickly.
It's all of your grow out because, you know, that like the landlord is going to come to
it in the morning.
They give you a 24 hour notice or like you're coming back or the upstairs apartment flooded
and you knew the cops were coming.
Like, you know, there are so many scenarios.
You hit it right there.
That's where if you didn't sometimes you might even have to just turn and burn and just be
like, oh, shit.
I'm out.
You know, I'll just get some more and I'll start again and everything will be a lot.
You know, it's, you know, sometimes you got to take the L, you know, it's not a.
You know, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
I've been hating hearing that.
Then I heard it the other day and I was like, you know, that's actually pretty insightful.
So do you have any plans to release anything in the near future?
Are you guys do you guys have anything in the works for in the future that you guys
are going to want to be crossing together and kind of release into to the community?
And then if so, where are you guys going to be doing seed drops and stuff like that?
I've got to know this stuff, right?
There's a couple of cool, cool things we're working on here.
There's a couple of cool, cool things we're working on here.
You know, the five is about to.
The five is about to pollinate the world.
I'm going to be turning the five upside down, making it do the little happy dance.
You know, I hope I don't offend anyone.
I'm going to crank a whole bunch of old school Madonna.
I'm going to make that thing fucking turn.
It works.
It works.
Try it.
You got to put that shit on 11, though.
OK, but, you know, the you know that that five call and I think it's going to be really
fun to play with.
We have a I'm doing a little selection right now on some sour double HP 13s that I made
in 2017 that I've just been sitting on, you know.
I should probably do something with these probably right.
So I got some of those.
And some wedding cake piece.
You know, there's the there's the one, you know, the one.
I got a question.
So because I was I was talking to Don a lot right before he passed, because he was kind
of switching over to using organics and stuff.
So I was like, oh, here you can do this.
This is telling them different stuff that he could try out.
And he was working on I think it was a wedding cake glue cross.
Whatever happened, whatever happened to that thing, because I don't think that I don't
know.
You know, look above you.
The oven's got the look above you.
What's up?
Came out here because that was the last thing that he was working on.
Right.
Because I went over to his house like just maybe a few months and he had his garage all
all pimped out.
He's like everything was already pollinated and he was showing me and in my in my friend
JT and I was like and then I just never saw anything.
I was wondering who who was working that project because that sounded pretty cool.
Yeah.
But yeah, I just started.
I just grew out the gluements.
It's a beautiful plant.
Got lots, lots of like shades of purples and auburns.
It's got good color.
I should probably come down in about a week and a half, maybe two, just depending.
Organic goes a little bit longer sometimes.
And then at the same time, I was kind of working on a reversal to get the GG for to actually
to back cross that back one more time.
So that's what I got going on is I have a G4 reversal in one tank and I got all of the
other crosses in there that we're going to go ahead and cross back and just kind of see
what those I'm sure we'll get some testers for those and kind of see where those go.
Definitely.
The things that he was kind of working on towards the end with the farmer to farmer
line is kind of where we wanted to go with that.
So we've got the for anyone asking what the glue men's or we haven't really named her
yet.
We don't she don't have a name is going to be the Cushman's by the wedding cake.
I have to.
And but we've got her and then he's also got the GMO that you saw.
Great.
That garlic.
What you mean?
If you it's neat because a lot of the things that you're going to see is being released
to the public.
OK, I got things I got released to public is, you know, if you go back to his IG and
you see the things that he was personally working on himself.
Those are the things that we want to come out with a little bit first, but kind of keep
some of the bombshells for later.
Like I said, we're going to be doing a lot of the things that we're going to be doing
some of the bombshells for later.
Like I always told him, I said, you know, to me, being the person that I am in the marketing
industry that I've been and especially the dotcom I came from, you know, I always told
myself, I want to make you deceive jobs of of cannabis and I need your fingerprint on
everything.
And so over the next five, 10 years is as the genetics evolves.
Those are the things and I'm glad that you remember that because those are that was one
of his favorite plants and he wasn't sure if he should keep it or if he should throw
it away.
The other one he was really proud of was the fire pipe by Mac, by Doug.
I think he's got so much Mac and dub in it that it's just so I think it's a little slow,
which is cool because I kind of like when we bring that into the light and then she
brings it up.
I'm kind of, you know, I should like the nice plants that grow big and fast like this one
you don't want to do anything, do you?
We should talk.
We should hang out, you know, let's let's produce a little bit.
I want to play with you like that.
Those are good.
That's super.
Let me get with the five and then some of the other stuff, too, that I Gucci's going
to get hit with that five.
We talk about the Superman.
Yeah.
No, no.
Oh, I did that one.
You did that one.
So I cross when I did the reverse of the Gigi for I hit the super lemon haze by ethos and
then I hit the star pupil by mass medical strains and I didn't get very much pollen
off of that, but I did get a small selection and I got those sent out to a tester right
now.
So I'm going to see what comes out of that.
We get something nice and talk to Cat and Gray and see if we can bring that into something.
But I really, really like your star pupil.
Your Lucy and your that.
You know, he liked the Primo Black.
Lucy was kind of new.
She was under a different name.
The race to space is pretty.
Yeah, it's super chunky.
You see a lot of.
There's a lot of good stuff that we're going to play with in the future.
And then we got some stuff that since we were kind of collaborate that we might release
just all depending.
Yeah, I mean, you left a list of all the cultivators or breeders that he wants to work with that
he didn't get a chance to work with.
You know, I know you really wanted to work with swamp boys.
There's a couple others.
I can't pull my.
It was really cool when Cat was telling me about that initially, because, you know, she
was like, hey, you know.
This is who Don wanted to work with, you know, do you know who any of these folks are?
Try to just name off all these handles.
I was like, oh, yeah.
Oh, I just texted him the other day.
What's my name?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I was like, huh?
And like all these dudes, I'm like, they're my homies, right?
I've never been like, hey, dude, we should do a collab together.
What do you think?
I don't know.
I just don't do that.
Maybe I smoke too much.
I haven't done it.
Now I'm like, oh, I got an official reason now?
So I called one of them.
I was like, bro, guess what?
Guess what?
Get on the list.
I got this gig, bro.
And he was like, what?
I was like, bro, apparently I'm supposed to call you, and we're supposed to do something.
He was like, oh, yeah, talk to him about that.
I was like, so that's going to be me now?
He was like, sweet.
I was like, wow.
I was like, dude, really?
That's how that went?
Wow.
Yeah.
It's very cool.
I'm glad he had everything lined up.
And it's going to be really cool to knock off everything on that list.
Yeah, some of the things we're leaving some things behind us and carrying on what he wants to do.
But at the same time, I don't want it to be a, you know, I also want it to be what Gray wants to
do and what does Seven want to do and what is, you know, and then I just kind of follow their
lead and help, you know, operate that and market that because I don't belong in the garden.
We got to put our spin on it, you know.
We still got to put our signature on it.
So it's, you know, so it's unique and it's not just, you know,
I don't want to put out something that's, you know, just off the shelf Walmart style.
That's not, you know, come on.
I got a couple of Landrace seeds.
I got a great seed collection.
I want to do something with like the Maseri Sharif and I want to kind of like
maybe play with the Kalamata Red and just kind of see where that goes and see if we can kind of
bring back some other stuff.
I actually have a skunk one male that I just picked up from Tom McCormick and his company,
his brand.
And I got that.
Hopefully it's a male.
Anyway, I kind of did a little search and I'm hoping to find a male so that I can kind of
bring back that old skunk that's early on in the lineage of the Gigi and see if we can just
make that work as well.
I kind of have a vision for that.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
That's skunk.
Yeah.
Like I told him, I said, cause we got, you know, the Josie face.
I always told him, I said, I'm just going to go ahead and, you know, plaster you all over every,
uh, he like big shirts on my wall.
I got, he's everywhere.
I had to take down all my old marketing and put the new marketing up.
But, um, you know, imagine just smoking one, you know, a Josie on, you know, a blind.
I mean, that's my, my goal.
You know, I want, you know, Oklahoma shelf and, you know, grab a J with Josie on it and,
and light one for him.
And I want him to be in everybody's room and I want to be better.
Everybody already is smoking.
Right.
That's cool.
That's kind of that different direction that we kind of need, need to, uh, need to take now with,
uh, with all the junk that's, you know, been going on.
You know, Gigi strains had, uh, you know, Don and Ross, you know, they died, you know, people die.
Shit happens.
And, you know, the wolves came out and, or they came back really is kind of what happened.
And, you know, we're, we're, we're kind of getting a lesson in, uh,
you know, dotting all your eyes and crossing all your keys.
It's, uh, it's, it's been interesting.
It's one of those things where we, we, we learned a lot in legal terms and,
you know, revisited a lot of, you know, personal stuff.
So, I mean, I guess if people, this would be a time to say if people,
don't know after, after, uh, Josie wills don't have passed away.
Um, a lawyer came and cat, you know, fought as hard as she could spend her entire life savings,
trying to keep the company out of his hands.
Um, and it's not somebody that comes out of nowhere.
It's not somebody that comes out of nowhere.
It's not somebody that comes out of nowhere.
Keep the company out of his hands.
Um, and it's not somebody that comes from cannabis and I, and the more I thought about,
you know, what he could do with, with what he has is strictly just, um, like a play on,
you know, trying to come after people that are using the name for any type of marketing.
Um, so that being said, I was like, you know, I was thinking, okay,
so what does an attorney who doesn't have access to the genetic,
who doesn't have access to the community, who isn't from cannabis,
what does he do with this company now that he owns it?
And the only thing that he could do to create a profitable business model
would be to go and sue people who are using, uh, you know, genetics, said genetics, or,
but you know, because you can't patent the actual genetics.
It's really just a, like if someone's using the name, you know, so just the whole thing now is
that things have to be worded differently because of, uh, legalities.
Um, but just no longer, you know, the old company that, you know, we're
GG genetics that are key is keeping the legacy going and being true to who we,
who we really want to be.
Um, yeah, we've had, we've had to, you know, kind of evaluate,
you know, what's our, what's our direction. And we gotta, you know,
go this way and kind of, kind of make a shift and, you know,
Well, what were you thinking about that, Brandon? I got that you were with,
with him being a patent kind of troll as they put up there,
where do you think, I mean, what can the community do to kind of stop that? If anything,
Well, it's difficult, right? Because technically, you know,
cannabis is still illegal on a federal level and we're protected by our state.
Yeah. We can't have banking, but they'll take our tax money.
I mean, they do take our tax money and if you pay, they do have safe banking. It's just that it costs,
you know, you know, 150 bucks a month to keep your money in there. Plus,
you know, they, it's just, they have, it's ridiculous. They basically tax your ass.
It's like how many cars at the toll yard, $50, retrieve the key, $20, open the gate,
$30, close the gate, like, whoa, bro. Exactly.
It is. But, you know, the whole thing is as, as we move forward into cannabis and we see these
things happening, you know, turpogs being sued by skittles. I'm surprised runts hasn't been sued,
but you've seen it. You've seen it in other cannabis brands. And that's, you know, those,
that's what those lawyers do. Those companies have legal teams that just go after people.
That's what they do. And that's how they can make money. That's why people trademark and do that
stuff. And for him to just, I mean, we all know that's a shitty ass fucking move. And so.
Oh, he was let go. The boys told him, you know, boys told him, Hey, we're done.
Yeah. So, you know, I, I,
guy, you know, when, when people die, you know, people really.
It's like, okay, so now I guess the community has to be careful if you're growing something
and calling it a certain name, especially let's say your license facility in a legal market,
you're going to have to probably be careful. Like you said, watch your,
your P's and Q's, you know, make sure that your verbiage on your packaging is correct.
So that way that kind of stuff doesn't come back to you because potentially if this dude wanted to,
he could set up a legal team to go after people in any state that has a legal market potentially.
So it's good though, to see that it's going to be continued and you guys are just going to go
kind of a different direction. I think that eventually you guys will find your, your
find your role and you'll be able to pick out really nice varieties and do the licensing stuff
and help do with the branding marketing. Because I think as new states open up, there are going to
be people who are going to need quality genetics, a guarantee, because a lot of people, I mean,
I know that I've been in this, you've been in this for a long, long time. Like we've been grown for
a long time, but it's not always the case. And there's going to be new businesses that open up
as new states open up and to be able to help them having people that come from the community
that are able to say, Hey, this is what this is. These are the operating procedures on how to be
able to do that. That can really help potentially help. And then also having like a distribution
channel that's set up with your marketing can be a really big potential, but not only that, but
you know, as a company, if you're also selling seeds, you're going to be supporting home grow
and being able to, you know, have that as a, you know, a foundation is like, we want to support
people to grow their own medicine as well. It's huge for me too. And I know that's not how you
guys feel because all of us come from that. I mean, you know, there's what, 455 grams in a
pound, right? That's 128 eights. You know, you figure two people sharing eights, that's 256
people. Every pound, four pounds is a thousand people flowers. That's a lot of people, you know,
and like with seeds, bro, how many seeds can you put in a pound? Right. So you can affect people
in that way. You know, there's your range of, of, of helping someone's medicinal, you know, needs is,
is increased, you know, and then for, and then the, the rec people who just want to like, you know,
just want to get ripped, bless their hearts. Fuck. Yeah. You know, you too.
Well, that goes back to what Brandon was saying about Oklahoma. The neat thing about Oklahoma
and why I love having our base there is you still have craft. I mean, it's, you have, you can,
you can have your mass grow. I think it's just down the way from you. You just see all these,
you know, mass production and that's fine. And like this, somebody over here just said,
unfortunately, most people look for at the masses, look for the crap or seeds or genetics.
They look for the Mylar bag and what's the prettiness on the outside, so to speak is what
he's saying. And it's true, but you know, as long as we can, yeah, there you go. But as long as
you're the craft cannabis, we need to educate. Like my job as being, you know, the operations
marketer is trying to educate people to understand the difference between if you walk into a
dispensary, you see two Mylar bags, you see Josie's face next to something pretty, you know
that this is going to be the real deal and that you're going to go home and you're going to be
so stuck to that couch. It's unbelievable. It's our job to educate these people that if you want
mids, it's kind of like when you're 18 years old and you walk into a liquor store and you go for
fricking Mickey's, you want to get fucked up. And that's your only point.
I think you're just aged myself there.
You could say like a Boone's farm.
Right, Boone's farm, right? And it's not always happened, but as long as we have these, you know,
these growers like you guys, we're going to be able to have quality genetics, quality grow. So
as that 18 year old that wants that Mickey's or the Boone's farm educates themselves and
sophisticated, sophisticated, I can't speak, because I'm getting excited,
sophisticated himself and becomes a connoisseur of cannabis. They're going to look for the palette.
They're going to look for the taste and they're going to look for the bud structure. And by the
time they're 31 years old, they're going to be at that spot. So the craft cannabis is always
going to stay. We might not be billionaires like mass production, but we're going to go to bed at
night knowing what we're giving them is quality and quantity and helping educate that consumer.
It's so important. You know, I believe it's so it's that's my biggest thing that I want to be
able to continue doing. And I'm so lucky to work with these two guys as I can keep doing what I
love to do, which is brand and market quality genetics. And hopefully we can keep doing that.
And, you know, sorry, I had I saw that comment come through. And it's true. I mean, you walk in,
you know, there's there's Bud Light and there's Bush and then you've got, you know, craft beer.
It's not easy, but you stick a Denny's steak in front of someone, then you stick a Ruth Chris
cowboy in front of someone. There's an immediate they're going to oh, wait a minute. You know,
you want this like thing from or do you want the the the mana from heaven action like,
you know, so long as we just keep presenting the mana in a consistent level, then that's where
the voodoo tricks are going to get going to get done. And they're just going to think the standard
is, you know, really good pot. What do you mean there's bad pot? What do you mean? What are you
getting? Or just looking at the TTC? Because we're following our SOPs, right? So we're consistent as
a mofo. And that that, you know, if we can have that, you know, if we can put that steak in that
bag, they're going to know. And they're going to we need to put it in a can. Can I like,
I, our kids are market kind of guy. I like seeing the big thing. But you know,
oh, yeah, no, I'm with you on that. That's always nice. But it's fun.
I think that when you're able to do a proper job with the marketing, but the product is also
quality. I think that's where it comes in. Because you can make you know, you can, like I said,
you could package up crap all day long and make it look pretty. But when you package something up,
and then what's inside is just as pretty as the outside. That's what really gets people because
people want to have, I think, an experience as well. At least I know the connoisseurs do.
Rod Karrasch That's an experience. They
and they can rely on that and come back time and again and even try different flavors from that
brand. Yeah, I mean, it's, it's a really good kind of marketing up for a to, to be able to say,
hey, we have this new variety, we're growing it out, we're going to be releasing a seed line,
and then we're going to be doing a drop over here through, you know, so and so farm,
and it really kind of ties things together. Because the experience is more than just,
you know, can be more than just watching it online. If you're in that area, you can go and
get the weed from the cultivator, and then you can go and get seeds of it and try and growing
it out yourself. So it enhances the overall experience that one can can have and participate
with, you know, the companies and the people that are producing these things. It's like
engaging, even if they're not directly, you know, connected to these people, you know, per se.
They're still feeling the vibe and getting getting getting to ride that. And that's,
that's, I think that's really cool. Yeah, I mean, I think that's, that's kind of what I'm,
that's kind of like what I try to do with, with, you know, what I do, because I, you guys know,
I do a lot of different types of education stuff. And I like to showcase, hey, this is what's going
on. This is what you can do in organic, like, hey, look at here's the box that we can that I,
you know, hunt stuff in. And it's just being able to, like, connect all the things and then be able
to say, hey, I have a drop coming and you can grow the same things that we're growing. And then if
you're, you know, in the area, we're going to be doing this run and you can go get this, you know,
it ties things together. And that's the beauty about kind of being here in Oklahoma, too, is you
can have kind of vertically integrated business models that allow for these really, you know,
awesome concepts to build new businesses upon. Right.
It's pretty hard. I'm really just stoked that the people here are so receptive to it as well. That,
that tripped me out, man. I was like, Oklahoma? You know, the one above Texas, right?
That was...
So if you ask, if you ask people that are from here, they're, they, they were pretty surprised
themselves. But it because it was a community effort. But you also have to remember, this is
a state that 10 years ago, you couldn't even get a tattoo in. Right. You know, we're talking about
a state where you couldn't buy liquor on Sundays anywhere. You're, it's, it's different. It was
different for a really long time. And it was, you know, highly penalized. So to see kind of what it
is now, I love seeing it because again, it's a lot of small craft operators. So they're able to bring
a lot of really cool brands and a lot of people can operate and it's more, it's more community,
you can go to all these different events and interact with the cultivators. That's how me
and Grace met. He took a trophy home and I took the trophy home and we got the...
No, he showed me like, come on, let's do that shit, dude. That shit was fun. I was talking
to Daniel after and Daniel was like, bro, there were some fights among the judges, bro. It was
fucking tight at the top. I was like, whoa. Yeah. It's cool to be able to interact like that
with so many, you know, so many different people who are doing so many different things. So there's
a lot of good processors and that's the cool thing too. It's like, hey, one of the things you
guys can be selecting for is things that dump. We all know Gorilla Glue 4 is a straight dumper.
Everybody wants to wash it because you can get huge yields. Absolutely. And so having things like
that for these craft markets where you can have a really high quality return rods in and you can
license those out because if you know for certain that if you're growing this certain lane, you're
going to hit, you know, 6% on a wash return, it's going to be profitable for that company, especially
if they're vertically integrated. If they're vertically integrated and they're not having
another processor and they don't have to do a split or pay them to do the work, you know,
they're going to get a good return and that can, you know, and that will... On the farmer table, that's, you know, that's how you do it.
So yeah, it's going to be really cool to see what we can incorporate and really, you know, bring to
the farmer, to the farmers and the growers, you know, different stuff for them to play with, you know,
because I mean, yeah, there's the classics, but then like, check this new thing out, you know,
I'll listen to the first tool album, then I'll listen to the latest one, you know, which is
what still five years old. Well, like, you know, it's, you know, you keep it going. And that's,
it's really cool what we get to do. And I'm going to try and do it where it's less like
tool albums and a little more quick, quick, quick. Well, and I think to go back to your
scene, Brandon, about, you know, washing, you know, with the glue, and that was one of the things that
Josie loved about making a cross with the glue was you could, you could find a plant that didn't
have a good return or a good yield on it, and you could cross it with the glue and bring out
the best in that plant. And, you know, that's one of the reasons so many people have crossed with it.
One, because of the glue. Right. I mean, it's gonna bring out the best. You're it's your line.
What is it? The limo Rola? Yeah, I mean, that one, the turf profile on that one is phenomenal.
You cross that with the glue. Now your yield and your return rate is phenomenal. You put two,
two beauties together and you're gonna have, you know, Victoria's Secret model pretty soon.
Yeah, that was black lime reserve and gorilla glue.
And I have, you know, I have a few different cuts of it, but I have a breeder cut that's
really nice and it crosses really well. And I did some work with some neck V2 on it. And
my box is actually full of
crosses that have gorilla glue in the lineage. I mean, I think almost probably 80% of everything
in my no, no, not the black line reserve. 50% of everything in my box is has that in the parent. So
and the death breath, that death breath that got that I got third place for it. The cowboy cups,
the grandparent is really blue because it's limo Rola crossing the purple coast grape guard.
So that one was, you know, it's in there. And I like to use the glue across stuff because
it brings out that like frost factor.
Nobody likes frost. Nobody cares. Why is it sticking to the bag? I don't get it.
That's funny. I don't know if it went if they ever taught you about the,
you know, is it real? Stick it to the wall. That was one of those biggest things. He'd always be
like, well, everyone always like reach out to us. How do I know it's real? Stick it to the wall.
And it was will sub cools. Buddy will still will. I think he goes by and he sent me a picture after
he flew out to Vegas and met the guys one time and sent me a picture of, you know, Ross's GG for on
the wall. And he's like, it's been here for 48 hours. I'm like, yep, that's how it's real. And
so actually the Oklahoma connoisseur put a thing, a little dot and, but that, you know, there's,
that's the, the, the true glue, it sticks the wall because of the cross.
But that's a good one. I was actually smoking that, you know, it was really crazy coincidence
when I found out Don died. Yeah, I'm smoking. I was, you know, taking a bong rip. And I was
actually texting my buddy crazy composer. And he was like, Hey, dude, Don died. I was like, what?
I was like, exhaling glue. I was like, that's the time to hear it. Like, whoa. Very. It was kind of
fitting. I thought that was kind of Whoa, what a weird, you know, it was cool. It was, you know,
it was very funny. How everything's now kind of laid out is, you know, very interesting.
Right. Sorry, I took another bong.
Speaking of your bong rips, someone earlier was wondering what you're smoking on right now.
That, you know, for, is that your 62%?
I legitimately did. It was 40, like 0.9%. And then like 9.8 or something terms. I don't
know. I was just like, I can't show anyone this. I looked, I was like, no way. Like,
then I had another one from that batch that was 38 and six. And then that's where my glue was 33.
And like, I think it was 7%. He got a fritter of 32. And I was just like, wow. I'm crazy.
This over here.
But what I'm smoking is it's a you know, when you grow the chem 91, you know, sometimes
get a flower pop up. And one of those flowers hit, you know, one of my value. Oh, geez.
And so I have two seeds. I was like, Oh, I'm gonna run this. I ran it.
And a really stony, really stony. I was I was smoking it. It sounds like I was gonna say no,
I was like going to do that. I was getting scared. Because I was like, you know, when you test your
quality control, you want to keep ripping it, right? You want to keep ripping it. I want to
keep ripping it. I think the the factor of the return factor do I want to go back and do it
again? That's important. You know, did I do something good or not? Right? You know, do you
want to do it again? And I was like, I want to do it again. I was like, I don't know if I want to
do this again. I don't know. And then I got the test back on that one. It was 37%. I was like,
fuck, that's just legit. Holy fuck. And that's what he's smoking. And I'm smoking. I'm smoking
on the last of that I, I wish the flowers would have been more spherical and more better to use
their bunch of little just, you know, they're, they're good. They're very gassy. They, like I
said, they made me go, Ooh, sorry, but they're just these little kind of little nugs. It works.
It's I like smoking. But you know, that's exactly what you know. And that's, that's the whole thing
is, you know, for me is like, take something is do I like smoking it or not? Like, you know,
because I figure if I like smoking it, someone else is gonna like smoking it because you know,
I'm kind of like smoke. But yeah, that's what I'm smoking. So sorry, sorry for the sidetrack,
everyone. It's a better do another one to correct my path, right? I'm feeling the smoking GG for
a bad C. Wait, wait, wait to be true to the glue, man. I didn't know. I had to ask Rach. I was like,
what am I smoking? She said, G4 because I just hit some other stuff before I didn't know if
I was mixed in. Where's your pig? I think I was under the table right here. Being quiet.
I was like, I didn't think it was in there.
Now the pig has to come up and say, I know you can't just like,
it's our mascot.
You're wearing pants, right? All right.
Yeah.
Man.
There's that awesome.
There's it.
Sit it down, man.
I got to show my wife.
We're talking about getting
another.
Oh, and the dog.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go get my dog.
I'm gonna go get my dog.
I'm gonna go get my dog.
I'm gonna go get my dog.
There you go, man.
Everybody gets along.
There's a cat.
What do you got? Noah's Ark over there?
He does. I love it.
You got to show him your cat's face.
Show the face.
Hey, he's done.
Oh.
He's like, no, you can look at my phone.
Look at that face.
I love that cat.
Yeah.
I have a baby gate that keeps them situated.
They can't get into the room because of the baby gate.
Yeah.
That's what makes me happy.
Pigs, cats, dogs.
It's an interesting
group of
personalities.
There's a lot of personalities.
I would say
for anybody who
wants to own a pig,
maybe think about it
again.
They're good
if they're gonna hang out outside.
They're gonna live that outside life.
Man, they get loud
when they're hungry and excited.
Hey, my people.
I need some food.
Yeah.
Wow.
I have to say that I'm looking forward
to seeing what
all happens and
what you guys come up with.
New crosses and
all that stuff.
We have...
Right.
Obviously, we got a lot of testing going on.
We're trying to stabilize everything
because we're bringing it back in.
Right now, I'll...
What was the cool terminology we were using?
Oh.
We've got Science Dude.
One person on our team is not here.
I call him Science Dude.
This is his formal name,
but I prefer Science Dude.
He's... What do we call it?
How do you say it?
Homogenize?
Yeah.
It's one of those words...
There wasn't a picture next to it,
so it didn't...
There's no button for me to understand.
There's a bunch of other little words.
I was like, I got to read that shit and remember?
Maybe we'll understand how to say it.
That's his lingo.
He's an agricultural scientist.
We'll call him Mr. Jones.
He's stabilizing everything
to be able to get us...
It's going to take some time,
but it's going to get us to a level
where we can support the bigger growers
and the farmers even
on a level that we haven't been able to
in the past.
That's exciting.
Are you talking about agriculture
or like a nursery where you can distribute bones?
No, this is homogenizing.
He's doing something
that's completely different.
I haven't heard of it either.
I don't know if it's homogenizing plants,
but he's doing some scientific stuff.
I should probably keep the bong down
next time we chat.
Are you talking about making
completely uniform seed stock?
Thank you.
That is perfect language that I can understand.
Yes.
I believe it's called...
Oh, man.
We talked about this a long time ago
on a Cheap Home Grow podcast.
Kyle Breeder,
my friend Kyle,
he knows what it is.
There's a certain way that a plant can
self-replicate itself.
It was very interesting when I...
I'll have to look.
I have some PDF files
I think in my drop box.
It's very advanced.
I think I know what you guys
are talking about.
Like I said, there was no pictures,
so I was like, shit.
I'll definitely get back to you on that one
when we have the right terminology.
There.
Major General. Thank you.
That's something future.
We have that, but currently
we do have the Josie Wells GG4
S1s.
We have great partners.
We've been working with Simon
of AK47.
Apomyxis.
Thank you.
Apomyxis.
I can polyophilia.
Apomyxis is where the plant is.
It uses, I think,
meiosis
instead of mitosis, or maybe I have that reversed.
It's able to
create
a seed from itself
that is a genetic
replica of itself.
It's like a clone.
It's like a clone.
It's not an S1.
It's not an S1.
It's not a pollen.
It doesn't require a pollen donor.
It's this type of
cell.
It's been a long time since I
was looking into this.
It's been over a year.
It's a type of cell
that is
almost like
what you would think of as
a stem cell
almost, I guess,
but it's not a stem cell.
That would be the incorrect terminology.
Not from tissue culture.
It's able to self-replicate.
Again, it's been so long.
That is
kind of like a dream
for any breeder to be able to have
just have a variety
that this is what this is
and be able to make that identical
across the board without any
genetic drift.
Like corn or
strawberries.
We don't want to do it
where it's like strawberries
that just look good and don't taste good.
We want them to be like the good
juicy strawberries.
You want it to be like the
cotton candy grapes which are
freaking delicious. Oh my gosh, those are
amazing. Yes.
Which was actually done through traditional
breeding as well.
It was.
There are different avenues
to explore.
That's actually when you go back to the grapes
and that's how I learned
my education about
breeding is I
talked to a bunch of different
vineyards and apple orchards.
I understood how they do their
breeding via the clone
versus seed and learned their
business model in order for me when I
started in 2015 to kind of figure
out this business model.
That was the first time I did the
candy can of cotton grapes. Those were amazing.
You guys are going to
get tissue culture set up at some
point I imagine. At some point.
We're still interviewing. We're looking for
that right partner. Here's the hard thing.
If we have something of somebody's
that is no longer in existence with
us, we want to make sure it's safe.
Our ultimate goal
is to find somebody that we can trust.
There's been a couple
of referrals of people to
find us a tissue culture partner.
Ultimate goal would have
all of our lineup in
a tissue culture for people to buy.
Clone farms
in every state.
Obviously the seeds.
We want to get
licenses in every state that we can.
If not, partner with somebody that's got a license
so they can distribute our seeds for us.
Currently right now
we're with
Neptune and Harvest Mutual
and Tree Star
and all the great partners
that we have right now. We'd like to be able to
get more into the dispensary
side of things or
the head shops if they're
trying to sell them, etc.
We've got out right now
in the different places I just said, we've got
the Josie Wells Legacy
line with the GG4s, S1s
that Simon,
AK47, has been working with us.
Simon of
Serious Seeds has really stepped in
and really helped us out a lot of different
things. Like I said, when Josie first passed
I was kind of handed a shit show.
There's been amazing
guys and girls that have came in
to make sure we navigate in the right direction.
We have
a 4x5
that's being phenode right now and that will
be released. We do have,
knock on wood, I hate saying this because
Mother Nature, I'm on Mother Nature time
and every time I say something
it never happens because
the air conditioner broke.
People have been waiting for
our IDLs from the Josie IDLs
and we do have his mail and we
have the BX6
mail and we've got the female
and they've finally been revived
and they're ready to go again.
They're drying! So knock on wood,
we're close. I know our fans
have been waiting for years for us to
release that again, over a year.
We'll have that. We really want to do
the glue mints that you talked about, Brandon.
We want to hit that 5
with some root,
like the GMO. We want to do it with
the Cherry OG.
The Cherry OG.
We're gonna
make a classic line.
People come to us,
like I had an idea,
if somebody thinks, oh I want to do this
and we have it, well let's just do it together.
Brandon, you have an idea.
There's a big saying out there,
we're better together
and that's the truth in this community.
As we keep evolving, we need to stop
fighting against each other and start
fighting for each other because
when Big Pharma comes in,
we need to be locking.
We need to be hand in hand.
If we're all together and we're
breeding together and we're making
collabs together, then we can
continue that fight together and
Big Pharma can have their own.
It goes beyond that.
I just kind of wanted to touch on something
real quick because I do a lot of consulting
for a lot of different growers,
not just in Oklahoma,
but I have
a
I have some friends
that I do their soil agronomy
work out in Oahu.
And
you know, they're the
largest patient-based grow
on that
island and what ended
up happening was there was legislation
so people came in, they had a lobby group
to convince legislators to change
the law and they were going to basically
have to shut down their whole
everything that they've been working for
and they brought to my
attention like this is something
that
we had to actually physically fight
and we had to go and get another lobby
group and they had
to go in there and
do the exact same thing that these
people did. So it's more like
these legislators really
don't care where the money comes from, but
they want their friends who are
the guys that are the lobby guys
and it's kind of
almost like legal bribery and it goes back
and forth and it's like some people are going to try to pay
to do some sneaky ass shit
and it's up to other people
you know to financially go and do
the same and it goes back and forth, back
and forth. What I'm slowly learning
and I didn't realize the
side of this
industry is that there
will be collectively groups of people
that will come together and
they might just be a group of people that are
you know meeting together once a week and
eating pizza, smoking weed, but
they're all the people who own let's say
labs and they're like oh let's get a lawyer
and attorney to try to change this law
so it will benefit our businesses.
Nobody else knows that that's happening, but those
people go and pay and it's up to
like and then everybody's wondering
why there's new like change to a
law and like what the fuck everybody's pissed
and it's like so you have to kind of
be proactive as a community
and kind of like come together
to be able to
get the legal
assistance to keep combating
the other people who are going to come
out of nowhere. You know groups
like the things that are happening in Michigan
you know all those companies that came together
to try to get rid of the caregiver program
and change the laws and what they
have to do is collectively come together
and hire a lobbyist. Again
politicians really just care about
Dude, how's Ron Durbin with
Metric?
Right, so Metric is
gone and it's crazy right?
So check this out in Oklahoma Metric
tried to come in here, but the courts
actually stopped it and said you know
and it was it's a dead issue. The courts
basically said we stopped Metric, but then
there was a I think the governor
like implemented
immediate procedures that were like
oh no we're implementing it and all he
did was make himself
I think involve himself
in that suit now because there was
already a court order against it and he said
it was up like okay so now he kind of
involved himself and I think
these legal proceedings inadvertently
without us knowing and probably because
again he was lobbied
by some group that
that was you know again
dude a lot of your lobbying is like
so much
talk about this
this is kind of my opinion on
on how these things are kind of
working. It's like I think
the legislators are
politicians and stuff they want to get
paid too and they'll either do it through either
taxing or actors or accepting
money from
you know legal groups to
you know oh we'll pass legislation
we're going to talk to our people you know
that's like what they do they politic
right that's what politicians do
they politic and that's their job and
they want to get paid. So
it's just like this back and forth
game that basically this game
is what it's like to be a
basically this game is what it
seems like to me and it's like I'm just kind of
understanding this and
it's kind of
up to the community to kind of
just you know
like stick together
to be able to pass.
When we try to want to change things
and we're like hey we should try to do this
and I'm like dude we're going to ruin it.
Oh no!
It's fine everything's fine let's just work with it
we'll be okay we'll be okay
It's good it's just you know
the more they're going to tweak it like
I haven't ever seen it get tweaked and get
better.
Oregon, Hawaii
I've never seen it like
go from like you know
guys going yeah it kind of fucking sucks
to dude this is the best ever like
I just haven't seen that turn.
Ideally what I'd like to see
is I'd like to see the legislation
continue to open up
across other states
and if federal legislation goes
through I think that because there's a lot
of really good craft growers
in Oklahoma
so centralized hopefully
we can have
interstate commerce
where we're able to send products
to states that have newly emerging
markets because of the central location
and the right shipping here
Thanks Chip!
You know and we can
export you know.
It would be beneficial to business
because essentially it would be bringing
money into the state of Oklahoma
it would also
continue the economic growth
as far as cannabis goes
but as far as all the ancillary businesses
like I always say and I repeat myself
constantly HVAC guy
electricians the guys that
build stuff the guys
that install stuff.
The realtors that are selling property
everybody gets a piece
and it creates an
economic boom and if you have
companies like Metric which tax
millions of dollars on businesses
and it doesn't even stay in the state
it's not
economically conducive to
growth and that's essentially
what we want to see and I'd love to see
that type of growth explode
for especially for the operators
here that you know
have craft farms because
they can send their products out
to other states if you know
federal legislation is passed
and it can really bring prosperity
to people.
Bring prosperity but then also at the
same time it brings
an improvement in
the level of cannabis.
It elevates it for everyone so
it brings everyone more relief
more peace of mind
more you know
you're able to mow your lawn
a lot better you can really
get into
paying your house or reading that book
or whatever you know there's a lot of really
great benefits that you can get from having
that cannabis just spread
that whole way
it would be really awesome
to be able to just see it
on a greater level.
Yeah it's pretty awesome.
I apologize if you keep hearing
the semi trucks humming by
going ooooh
You know it is getting pretty late
I've only got 3% left on
my phone so maybe we should
kind of do our
sign off let everybody know
where they can find us on social media
kind of give shout outs and
call it a night.
And I want to know Seven how many animals
are in the ark right now?
Two cats, two dogs,
a pig and
there's a horse but he's not here she's not
here.
The one thing
that Josie and I like is we like
animals more than we like humans
and it kind of
shows by
who we hang out with.
We have the same kind of dog cat.
We do?
Oh we do?
Yeah my little Aussie
I had to hide her because she's got this
squeak now. Seven heard it this morning
we were chatting and he's like what the hell is that?
She squeaks her little toy
and she goes
and it sounds like a squeaky toy but it's not.
It's her.
That's what they do huh?
Yeah she has a whale
and a squeaker in it and she goes
I'm going to have to send you the video
it's the cutest thing
and I got two other dogs too but
then I got, I love animals.
Alright so where can you find
what's your IG?
All that good stuff.
Where can everybody find information on
what's happening with the brand?
Okay well as
of right now
the only website that we have currently
would be Josie Whales and that's going to be
J-O-E-S
Y-W-H-A
L-E-S dot com
and it is misspelled not like the way
the other one is. We've learned our lesson
that way. Yeah I was going to say
there's a good reason
why. Right right.
You know what it is.
Right.
So that one's up and coming. I'll be
adding all of our
novelty vendors on there shortly.
Novelty vendors we have is
like Supreme, Neptune
Seeds here
now actually will be starting next
week.
James he's great.
I've known him for quite some time
and we haven't touched base since 2016
and we picked up right where we left off
and he's really
excited to hear about keeping
the legacy going and he's ready
to help us with it and so we're going to
be working with him. He's here in Oklahoma
and
he's got a
platform he came
he bought him like sandwiches. They're like
dude cool.
Crazy.
Yeah and Supreme has been nothing
but me. I don't. Supreme is
Seed Bank is just they're really
good people. They've really supported
the Josie Wales and donated to
Josie's family a lot.
So those are the top
novelty vendors that we have right now.
We're in the
process. We have a license in Oklahoma.
Gray has a license in Oklahoma
and goal is to get
the Josie's face on the shelf.
We're looking for people
to work with us on collaborations.
Our focal point is going to be more
you know seed to farmer and
getting that grow your own line
back out and not
holding it hostage and saying this
is our plant. You know it's when we
say it's our plant my terminology
has changed. It used to be
this is our plant but now when I say that it's our
plant and that's kind of what
we want to do with our seed. You know grow your
own line. So we've got
that coming out. So like I said we've got the GG4S
ones out already.
They should be on everybody's site that I
just said. Seeds are here now. We'll have
them live next week but Neptune
has them live right now. Tree has them live.
Harvest Mutual has them live.
We're looking
at getting into dispensaries in Oklahoma
as we speak.
If anybody wants you know
wants them in their dispensary just you know
hit me up on IG. We can kind of go
that route make sure that we have a distribution
license etc in that area.
Which are IG Cat?
I am now
at cat.gg underscore.
And then we also
do have the
at gggenetics dot
official. So that's
going to be kind of like anything that Sevin
does, I do, Gray does,
Mr. Jones does or anybody
else that we collab with will be over
there.
And we also have great partners like
you know Pier Sativa. All those
guys are have been phenomenal and that's
kind of where we're at right now and as we
evolve all them will be you
know 100% full stock.
Cool.
If anyone wants to send me a hate
mail it's what
grayskull underscore.
Or grower.
Yeah. Hey man you need
to like exercise more or something
you know.
You know.
You know.
I got 1% left.
So I got. Alright awesome Brandon I want to
thank you so much for having us.
I really do.
No problem.
And I look forward to working with you too as well.
Yeah.
And as Brandon dies
out kind of one of the
things he touched on earlier was
craft and I feel
like if if there were
you know
10,000 people like you guys
all making a couple hundred thousand a
couple million dollars a year
that's a better world
I mean I don't
know the names
of like all the
you know cannabis stocks
but like that's why I do the shit I do.
It's like I'd like to see you guys
all do well
together and like
your families and be
happy and not stressed out
and to the 300
plus people still watching like
I want them to be like
that'd be cool.
That'd be cool.
And that was always my whole point right.
With cannabis
the way it played out as a state by
state thing where each state gets
and people have heard me say this before but like
each state gets to kind of
chart its own course and I always
thought it'd be cool if
states were like
we don't need MS at
multi-state operators like
like why would
we need that we have lots of people who can
grow tomatoes like we don't need
the tomato conglomerate.
That's one of the cool things about Oklahoma is they're really
trying to focus on the Oklahoma
resident, the Oklahoma mom and pop
you know it's really
to give them an opportunity to
you know get a bite of the apple
you know there's
here's some opportunity guys ready to go
and you know they're trying to initiate
some new laws here to
keep you know
those foreign
investments you know
either out or you know now
they're supposed to
be disclosed.
It's really
kind of cool.
I mean and that's kind of you know I
feel like that's kind of part of
the gist of what Brandon wanted to talk about
is you know and I'd
love to see it like if Brandon wants to drive
a Mercedes I think he deserves it
like
definitely if
you want to drive a Mercedes like
I just want a Jeep.
I want big tires
and I want a
Great Dane as my passenger
like those are my goals.
With chickens in the back.
Yeah I think just
generally lots of people making like
decent amounts of money is
better than
people making
ungodly amounts
and the other thing is
you guys touched on it like
tilting the playing field. I feel
like that's what happens when lobbyists
come into
the equation where it's like
we're winning
and we're going to
tilt the rules in our favor
and I think that everyone watching
that's my hope that we all kind of
call shit out.
Right. And that we have
a voice to be able to
instead of calling each other out
as breeders or
let's work together and call the shit
out. And that's the part that drives me
the craziest is people who
are like kindred spirit
just like tearing each
other apart while
like
finance backed multi
state operators are just kind
of like doing what they want.
Like passing it through.
It's like wait a minute.
No. There's just a lot of
there's a lot of
how do I say this? There's not a lot of
trust in the shadows.
So
it's hard to get rid of that.
It's hard to get people to
understand that the
culture is still the culture unless
you fight the culture and you break it
and that's what's kind of happening.
It's happening all over anyway.
We got to fix it here if this is what we want
to do. People got to
if you don't want to do it
then you should probably go somewhere else.
Right. So whatever
state you're in either
grow your own weed or
if you go
into a dispensary just buy
craft.
It's the good stuff like
you know.
Please get the good stuff. You'll thank yourself
for it. You're worth it. You know you're
worth it. You are.
You deserve to smoke good weed.
I mean there's no reason
not to. There really isn't.
Yeah. Not anymore I guess.
Everybody's special.
And if you're in Maine go check out
Blue of Green Tank shop.
Next time I get up from Rhode Island
to Maine I would like to go hang out in his shop.
And that for me
you guys probably have no idea who I'm talking about.
I do not.
He launched a
dispensary in Maine and I'm
psyched to see him succeed.
Oh you gotta stop by and see Crazy Composer's
spot too. Crazy Composer
you know he's over in Maine. He's got
a Jibba the
online magazine Jibba that he's doing
which is a great
thing. He's a guy's
a stud. That guy is one of the
best growers I've ever
