[00:12.350 --> 00:19.150]  The plants that you received were bred by Josh and he'll tell you about what he
[00:19.150 --> 00:22.830]  did to make them and he'll give you the correct name on them but the main point
[00:22.830 --> 00:27.990]  was that I was so impressed with them in flower form that I knew that that it was
[00:27.990 --> 00:31.190]  something that had an ability to absolutely catch an attention of a
[00:31.190 --> 00:35.950]  customer and it's something that you can't deny it when you smoked it when
[00:35.950 --> 00:39.770]  you smelled it when you felt the effects and it was quality and I want that
[00:39.770 --> 00:43.490]  material to be shared so that individuals can and that was his desire
[00:43.490 --> 00:47.570]  to is to see the public at their hands on it so we're back to another breeding
[00:47.570 --> 00:51.530]  discussion and I'm gonna do the same thing I'm gonna let the guys introduce
[00:51.530 --> 00:57.970]  themselves and then we can start getting into some questions and once again thank
[00:57.970 --> 01:02.810]  you for taking the time out of your lives to listen to these discussions
[01:04.860 --> 01:18.340]  hi I'm Graham mr. Bob hemp ill I've been breeding cam to cannabis since 95 and
[01:18.340 --> 01:24.180]  collecting clones since about the same time and growing cannabis for production
[01:24.180 --> 01:32.100]  so made my life and just dedicated most of my time to preservation work with
[01:32.100 --> 01:38.060]  just keeping strains alive that weren't even market valuable anymore and
[01:38.060 --> 01:44.180]  amazingly 20 years later they've come back around where you know like the
[01:44.180 --> 01:49.460]  clubs need to have something besides the cookies on the market you know and just
[01:49.460 --> 01:53.500]  trying to have a diversity in the gene pool so we can get those old-school
[01:53.620 --> 02:03.540]  buzzes and just thought kind of stuff so that's really what I'm up to you guys
[02:03.540 --> 02:08.860]  kind of know me I'm Joshua Rutherford I'm not really a breeder I'm a
[02:08.860 --> 02:16.340]  pollen-chucker but straight straight up like I you know I feel like what I'm
[02:16.340 --> 02:20.340]  able to do is I have a good nose and a good taste I got blessed right away the
[02:20.340 --> 02:24.420]  first two plants I ever grew with strawberry cough and ATF and they were
[02:24.420 --> 02:29.780]  legit cuts I've never seen maybe once or twice have I seen the ATF that even is
[02:29.780 --> 02:35.300]  in the field and so I just got blessed that way and so you know every time I
[02:35.300 --> 02:39.620]  got something else that wasn't there is like beep beep beep I just I throw throw
[02:39.620 --> 02:45.820]  stuff away so fast I I'm heartless you know I don't know if that's the best
[02:45.820 --> 02:48.980]  thing there's probably other things that you can pull but what it allowed me to
[02:48.980 --> 02:53.020]  do is to make some money and to kind of be pretty self-funded I do have a small
[02:53.020 --> 03:01.740]  partner but anyways so this one is a pie hoe from Canerado genetics I got and it
[03:01.740 --> 03:06.220]  was feminized and so I wanted to sift through and make sure I got the ones
[03:06.220 --> 03:09.860]  that we're gonna have any herms right so I'm not really down with colloidal
[03:09.860 --> 03:14.920]  silver or whatever the other stuff is and so I had accidentally learned a
[03:14.920 --> 03:19.560]  technique by throwing too much seabird guano pellets down which is a super
[03:19.560 --> 03:24.040]  high in nitrogen and so I I hermed out the whole bottom of my Obama Kush one
[03:24.040 --> 03:28.560]  time and it was just the bottoms and I was like okay well that's something so I
[03:28.560 --> 03:32.280]  searched and searched and searched and and somewhere I found that if too much
[03:32.280 --> 03:36.080]  nitrogen will force her and so I was like okay and so I tried it another time
[03:36.080 --> 03:39.480]  I tried three or four times and it's pretty predictable you know I can buy
[03:39.480 --> 03:43.800]  these seabird guano pellets throw them down pretty hard water them in really
[03:43.800 --> 03:49.080]  hard and if it works so that's what I did with the pie hoe and then I also had
[03:49.080 --> 03:54.560]  in the room this Catholic schoolgirl that was pretty cool and then this real
[03:54.560 --> 04:01.280]  Kush 7 from Kevin and so I was actually scratching my head on it because I'm
[04:01.280 --> 04:04.120]  just kind of reading into breeding and so I was scratching my head on a hit up
[04:04.120 --> 04:07.520]  Jean on Instagram and it's like what should I do with this like is this gonna
[04:07.520 --> 04:11.800]  just be a bunch of herm bullshit and he's like Apple doesn't fall far from
[04:11.800 --> 04:16.840]  the tree I'm like okay that's not enough information but it kind of is
[04:16.840 --> 04:21.920]  that's how I felt so I went for it you know whatever so I ran 300 seeds of it
[04:21.920 --> 04:26.520]  and I spent you know all night going through those cuts and I pulled out
[04:26.520 --> 04:30.840]  about six of them and and then smoked them and this is the one I kept and I've
[04:30.840 --> 04:35.080]  run it twice and it doesn't hurt my let it run extra long and stuff so I've
[04:35.080 --> 04:39.640]  kind of checked it so it's definitely stable and it's real big and beefy I run
[04:39.640 --> 04:45.360]  in the greenhouse it's super floral I wouldn't put it in the fruit category
[04:45.360 --> 04:49.040]  and there's not a lot that I call floral that or that's come across my palate
[04:49.040 --> 04:54.960]  that's really been floral and it's it's a it's a different customer like in my
[04:54.960 --> 04:58.120]  mom my parents actually smoked it probably shouldn't say that on the
[04:58.120 --> 05:03.400]  internet yeah a couple weeks ago for the first time in like 30 years you know and
[05:03.400 --> 05:07.200]  I just let him have a little bit of it but it was perfect because it's a real
[05:07.200 --> 05:12.680]  bright uplifting happy high my mom was just like what what is this flavor and
[05:12.680 --> 05:16.320]  it's kind of like this muted lemon floor but you know that I know that's
[05:16.320 --> 05:21.280]  fruit but it's real muted and florally rosy and yeah so I was super happy with
[05:21.280 --> 05:24.240]  it and I when I was coming down I wanted to give something back to Kev
[05:24.240 --> 05:27.040]  because he gave me some stuff and so I was like oh this is perfect this here you
[05:27.040 --> 05:33.120]  know so that's kind of yeah man thanks for for being cool you know it's it's a
[05:33.480 --> 05:38.400]  nice one and and the thing was before I before I hardly get into it what's nice
[05:38.400 --> 05:43.120]  about the panel is that I could sit a gram like a preservationist because he's
[05:43.120 --> 05:47.680]  he's someone who whole for as many times I was talked to a man he holds varietals
[05:47.680 --> 05:51.320]  for time and preserves them because he believes in the pricelessness of it not
[05:51.320 --> 05:57.160]  just in business but to himself and to the cannabis culture and and Hardy it
[05:57.160 --> 06:01.320]  was his scientific breeder where he has a very extensive background in many
[06:01.440 --> 06:05.840]  different things and so it gives you a different direction and then Josh says
[06:05.840 --> 06:08.800]  I'm just a pollen chucker but the truth is I wanted to see people who were just
[06:08.800 --> 06:13.480]  pollen chuckers because that's where everybody started and what happens is
[06:13.480 --> 06:17.560]  that you start to believe you don't have a validity if you're not someone special
[06:17.560 --> 06:22.000]  and the truth of it is is that you you have to be able to start somewhere and
[06:22.000 --> 06:28.120]  to get a plant that's that quality from someone who's just a pollen chucker lets
[06:28.120 --> 06:32.560]  you realize that you also can succeed and it's important because it lets you
[06:32.560 --> 06:35.960]  it lets you take and inspire other people who are gonna follow you every
[06:35.960 --> 06:39.600]  one of you will eventually have someone who takes your place in the game and
[06:39.600 --> 06:43.680]  it's important to be able to have people that are going to take your place that
[06:43.680 --> 06:48.440]  have good ethics and a desire to smoke kill weed otherwise you're gonna be an
[06:48.440 --> 06:52.840]  old man filled in a land full of booth and that's it's women you know it's not
[06:52.840 --> 06:57.640]  what you want so it's beautiful to have the diversity and I'll let let Hardy go
[06:57.640 --> 07:02.760]  but that's the whole point of it that that your your lack of full-time
[07:02.760 --> 07:07.200]  professional breeding doesn't diminish of validity at all it's just that to me
[07:07.200 --> 07:13.040]  you are the symbol of people who love weed and let their taste guide them in
[07:13.040 --> 07:20.480]  their process no that's that's key I'm Hardy with have core genetics and was
[07:20.480 --> 07:26.840]  in care collective we were one of the first well dispensary delivery out of
[07:26.840 --> 07:32.640]  Mendocino 9.31 program and wrote that out till the end and then Mendocino
[07:32.640 --> 07:37.240]  County as we know discontinued the 9.3 so at that time just switched everything
[07:37.240 --> 07:42.720]  over to R&D and breeding and working with CBD cultivars so that was that
[07:42.720 --> 07:48.560]  focus in 2009-10 where you tell people show lab results and they'd see CBD and
[07:48.560 --> 07:52.760]  it's like why are you growing this they don't relate to that and to the point
[07:52.760 --> 07:57.880]  earlier one thing was even this was 2012 if you got caught with lab results
[07:57.880 --> 08:05.960]  or seeds you're a sophisticated operation and you could you were in more
[08:05.960 --> 08:11.080]  trouble so if you had pitchers and this is something seeing this evolution and
[08:11.080 --> 08:14.560]  it's like you're not a being a pollen chucker it's like we were all chucking
[08:14.560 --> 08:19.040]  pollen in the beginning back here when it was like growing up around here when
[08:19.040 --> 08:22.640]  you had to hide out in a fucking tree when you had a helicopter coming over
[08:22.640 --> 08:26.480]  you sideways and you just had a little bit of pollen that you had to put on
[08:26.480 --> 08:30.520]  high and pollinate on that plant at a certain time but it was only one little
[08:30.520 --> 08:36.560]  plant so this is how the especially this is ground zero and it's amazing to see
[08:36.560 --> 08:40.600]  this many people here like coming out like this and I know things are changing
[08:40.600 --> 08:46.560]  but we are like everybody in here is like pioneer to the roots like this is
[08:46.560 --> 08:51.520]  coming back home this last year and traveling so much it's like you guys are
[08:51.520 --> 08:55.760]  this is the shit right here like as far as when you're gonna find good old
[08:55.760 --> 08:59.720]  genetics and people that really have that heart of soul and this last year
[08:59.720 --> 09:05.040]  having to travel around and seeing the big corporations that are coming in and
[09:05.040 --> 09:11.120]  just this general disrespect or disregard for the history of the plant
[09:11.120 --> 09:18.480]  that people here responsible for keeping this plant alive and being stewards of
[09:18.480 --> 09:25.320]  of these genetics and now it's just kind of coming together and part of this
[09:25.320 --> 09:30.400]  is like collecting this data and part of that IP because we all have something
[09:30.400 --> 09:36.600]  special to offer and don't discount that because everybody here has something
[09:36.600 --> 09:41.120]  their own kung-fu to bring to the table
[09:42.120 --> 09:50.480]  um what I was gonna say is uh what when you first began and then in the you know
[09:50.480 --> 09:53.960]  95 zone what were you what was the stuff that you were working with when
[09:53.960 --> 09:57.720]  you first got into cannabis because it must have had a profound impact on the
[09:57.720 --> 10:01.520]  fact that made you love it so much that you never let go of it because you're a
[10:01.520 --> 10:06.000]  you're a dedicated collector what was the stock you're working with when you
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.680]  began unfortunately I don't have any of those seats anymore but it New Year's
[10:12.680 --> 10:20.760]  show and between 94 to 95 I scored some bud from Humboldt and it was purple and
[10:20.760 --> 10:26.400]  grape and just dank as fuck and that's what encouraged me to like breed with
[10:26.400 --> 10:30.040]  the males and females the next year is because I wanted to have some more of
[10:30.040 --> 10:34.960]  that because in years prior to that I just grew Mexican bag seed you know
[10:34.960 --> 10:43.400]  because like there was no dank available and it's a shame at the time I
[10:43.400 --> 10:48.040]  really didn't know about breeding brothers to sisters that just didn't
[10:48.040 --> 10:53.400]  seem right to me so I outcrossed that strain to southern Virginia lines and
[10:53.400 --> 10:58.720]  didn't keep it pure but if I would have open pollinated that line and kept it
[10:58.720 --> 11:04.440]  pure I would really have had something special because it was amazing I'll
[11:04.440 --> 11:10.200]  never forget I was at a Grateful Dead show that next spring and I still had
[11:10.200 --> 11:15.280]  some and there's these really pretty girls from California on dead tour and I
[11:15.280 --> 11:20.720]  showed him a bud and I didn't even say that I grew and bred it I just said it
[11:20.720 --> 11:25.400]  was from Virginia and they just laughed at me and like started clowning me
[11:25.400 --> 11:31.120]  thinking I was lying trying to pick him up but I still think back and that was
[11:31.120 --> 11:40.160]  some amazingly dank just Afghan purple shit that was probably Urkel related
[11:40.160 --> 11:44.320]  yeah no I think that was like that that was like the little heyday of that
[11:44.320 --> 11:48.840]  transition from the last of the outdoor that still remained before the raids
[11:48.840 --> 11:52.680]  here then the raids came and people's populations compressed and then indoor
[11:52.680 --> 11:56.640]  just blew up and that's when I started seeing a lot of these old lines being
[11:56.640 --> 12:00.840]  woven out because they just didn't work on the indoor platform but yeah I don't
[12:00.840 --> 12:02.960]  have a lot of the stuff from that either that's what I'm trying to go back
[12:02.960 --> 12:06.480]  and dig through time and find older people that were able to hold on to
[12:06.480 --> 12:10.440]  little pieces because none of us really don't think knew what we had we kind of
[12:10.440 --> 12:13.720]  thought that it was gonna be here forever like that because it had just
[12:13.720 --> 12:16.600]  come into our hands you know you didn't really have the same level of
[12:16.600 --> 12:21.760]  appreciation for the scarcity now that you did then you were like whoa I'll get
[12:21.760 --> 12:26.360]  more good stuff so you went into the early per the early person and then you
[12:26.360 --> 12:29.640]  were talking about this first stuff that you really started messing around with
[12:29.640 --> 12:36.400]  was that the ATF cut yeah I actually still hold it that's the only thing
[12:36.400 --> 12:40.320]  I've been able to keep my whole damn grow career I've lost a lot of stuff but
[12:40.320 --> 12:44.960]  we kept it among three guys so it came into the house we started you know
[12:44.960 --> 12:50.120]  busted it out and four thousand a pack you know I figured the game this out
[12:50.120 --> 12:53.400]  real quick in a year and a half four thousand a pack I you know see you guys
[12:53.400 --> 12:58.360]  I'm moving you know you guys aren't your own in that basement and but it was um
[12:58.360 --> 13:03.160]  yeah it's the the muskiest earthiest thing I think I've ever smelt straight
[13:03.160 --> 13:06.280]  up you know I kind of sniff around to see if I can find anything it's like
[13:06.280 --> 13:11.600]  forest floor I'd love to talk to anybody that has any experience with that with
[13:11.600 --> 13:15.760]  that cut I know Josh and Kelly have some connection to the matinouska I'm not
[13:15.760 --> 13:21.000]  sure the exact difference some people say it's the same but it's real fluffy
[13:21.000 --> 13:24.960]  and it's we could I could see it across the room in that jar we all would be
[13:24.960 --> 13:29.920]  like what's that one it's white bring that one over here you know and it's
[13:29.920 --> 13:33.560]  interesting because marketability it's it's fluffy you know you when you grab
[13:33.560 --> 13:37.440]  it out of the jar it's like oh I don't know and then you pop that thing open
[13:37.440 --> 13:42.440]  and even it fills the room and yeah so I'm interested to like actually start
[13:42.440 --> 13:46.240]  working and putting some stuff into it so my goal this summer is to you know
[13:46.240 --> 13:50.960]  run a bunch of stuff and find some males that I think will put some stuff on it
[13:50.960 --> 13:54.560]  just you know try to start learning like like what Jackson said was earlier I
[13:54.560 --> 13:58.600]  know this ATF really well you know I can walk into a garden and see crosses
[13:58.600 --> 14:01.880]  with it actually I found that the other day and if I have a to garden they had a
[14:01.880 --> 14:06.480]  Cali crush crossed with it I was like before she could say ATF I was like ATF
[14:06.480 --> 14:09.800]  you know these three leaves they always look the same you know she's like how'd
[14:09.800 --> 14:18.200]  you know I go I've been staring at that plant for ten years you know so you're
[14:18.200 --> 14:22.600]  you're old-school cat from the day here yeah and that's one thing with the
[14:22.600 --> 14:25.800]  strains these days and like looking somebody had mentioned earlier like
[14:25.800 --> 14:30.440]  looking at the chemotype we've gotten so caught up in this name game anymore it's
[14:30.440 --> 14:35.040]  like having to backtrack from this and that was one thing looking at CBD CBD is
[14:35.040 --> 14:38.280]  and other cannabinoids it's like okay where are the origins of this one
[14:38.280 --> 14:43.320]  recently is the variance and where the variance are the origins of the variance
[14:43.320 --> 14:49.000]  and we're finding more from like the Africa from Africa and like Lao areas so
[14:49.320 --> 14:53.440]  why is this happening but it's like we're it's having to backtrack right now
[14:53.440 --> 14:58.680]  so some of these older sativas that weren't marketable then it's that that's
[14:58.680 --> 15:02.600]  that still that smell and it's out there and if that's the thing it's up it's up
[15:02.600 --> 15:07.160]  in these areas but Jerry for instance it's like with that Panama Red and going
[15:07.160 --> 15:11.520]  back and like these poisons and like you go back in history and on this lineage
[15:11.520 --> 15:16.080]  it's identifying the baseline so that's something the last couple years I've
[15:16.080 --> 15:22.840]  been working on is is breeding bringing these older cultivars back and getting
[15:22.840 --> 15:27.200]  that baseline back and then sort of moving forward from there it's like
[15:27.200 --> 15:30.680]  looking at it like that color palette of like you have your CMYK you know you
[15:30.680 --> 15:36.200]  have your basic colors so let's start with this and from there we identify
[15:36.200 --> 15:40.800]  these different traits and now that we're able to look at the chemotype and
[15:40.800 --> 15:46.480]  genotype of what these what are the constituents of the cultivar that you're
[15:46.480 --> 15:50.520]  looking for so it's like if you're looking to make extract and that's all
[15:50.520 --> 15:54.200]  you're looking for you want that orange to juice with those terpenes or if
[15:54.200 --> 16:00.560]  you're going for just a certain cannabinoid and and identifying those
[16:00.560 --> 16:04.840]  genetics so it's like we've been monocultured so much here especially in
[16:04.840 --> 16:08.920]  Northern California being run by sour diesel and OG because this is the market
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.960]  this is what's putting the paycheck in so that these cultivars have been lost
[16:13.960 --> 16:20.160]  that were actually have probably more of a value because of what they have inside
[16:20.160 --> 16:24.920]  of them and instead of the marketability of what that pretty flower looks like
[16:24.920 --> 16:29.800]  per unit you know that's going to a market so it's like looking at these
[16:29.800 --> 16:34.280]  cultivars that what we're growing maybe not per gram per square meter or per
[16:34.280 --> 16:40.760]  foot per light but milligram it's like what is what's inside of this and that's
[16:40.760 --> 16:45.480]  something looking into especially the you know the original cultivars these are
[16:45.480 --> 16:49.320]  where that the treasures are and starting to backtrack right now and
[16:49.320 --> 16:54.600]  actually collect the data because that's where that IP that all of us have worked
[16:54.600 --> 17:03.720]  our ass off for is a value what are you we're gonna get into some I'm gonna ask
[17:04.160 --> 17:12.520]  Graham you know what what what directions are you moving into and you
[17:12.520 --> 17:16.120]  are here in Cali but you're in Washington so the question is gonna be
[17:16.120 --> 17:20.400]  you know what directions are you seeing in your region and and then you're
[17:20.400 --> 17:24.720]  global you see a global picture because you are connected to so many different
[17:24.720 --> 17:28.880]  things and it was this way we'll be able to see what's going on here what's going
[17:28.880 --> 17:36.000]  on where you are what's going on from your view on a worldwide picture so
[17:36.000 --> 17:41.560]  mostly I just am working on some real strong northern lights indica's and hash
[17:41.560 --> 17:48.600]  plants and trying to get the old-school indica's in the seed form so it's more
[17:48.600 --> 17:55.220]  accessible accessible to people I'm also working on constantly doing open
[17:55.220 --> 18:01.820]  pollinations on different land races just to preserve them and on top of that
[18:01.820 --> 18:07.660]  I'm also working on several different lines and CBD trying to isolate the CBD
[18:07.660 --> 18:15.020]  I'm working on a Panama red that originally went from two to one to three
[18:15.020 --> 18:19.340]  to one so the next generation and then in this next generation after that I've
[18:19.340 --> 18:25.820]  just found a 39 to 1 which is pretty exciting so I'm really excited to flower
[18:25.820 --> 18:31.540]  that out check check the percentages what are some of the land races you
[18:31.540 --> 18:38.060]  playing with well I just try to work with and preserve any that I can get my
[18:38.060 --> 18:44.580]  hands on and you know a lot of people in seed buying markets say they want land
[18:44.580 --> 18:50.660]  race they really want good land race that works well for them they don't want
[18:50.660 --> 18:55.940]  every land race because there's a lot of problems and you know when you're doing
[18:55.940 --> 18:59.500]  a true open pollination you're not even calling out the hermaphrodites you know
[18:59.500 --> 19:09.820]  so it's just mostly for preservation and to look for good strains that maybe I
[19:09.820 --> 19:13.300]  can pull the next seeds out and make out crosses with them that's something that
[19:13.300 --> 19:19.700]  would work for the for the market but when I do find a good one that I can
[19:19.700 --> 19:26.020]  release I will but it's lots of times there's problems with the line or the
[19:26.020 --> 19:31.460]  source doesn't want it released pure unfortunately no no I can understand
[19:31.460 --> 19:34.620]  that no I because I I've seen some of the northern light the work you're doing
[19:34.620 --> 19:38.900]  some of the hash plant and to me it's awesome because I mean that was a stuff
[19:38.900 --> 19:43.940]  that was red hot and ultra quality in its time frame and it I think got kind
[19:43.940 --> 19:47.700]  of diluted as time went by and I try to tell people the source material was not
[19:47.700 --> 19:52.140]  weak it was some stunning stock so it's killer that you're going back that route
[19:52.140 --> 19:55.620]  and it seems like it's pretty well received too you know I see some I see
[19:55.620 --> 20:00.740]  some traction around it yeah it's um just basically trying to duplicate a lot
[20:00.740 --> 20:05.020]  of Neville's work and unfortunately since he's seed bank didn't do a good
[20:05.020 --> 20:11.940]  job and keeping those genes pull so I had the old cuts and luckily just the
[20:11.940 --> 20:17.180]  nl1 came to me from when I was working with coastal seeds and cake you had
[20:17.180 --> 20:24.220]  gotten it from classic seeds so it was just things came together and a really
[20:24.220 --> 20:32.780]  good situation with that line and um Ken Orado just gifted me some two by fives
[20:32.900 --> 20:40.540]  that he made f2s on and the original f1s were made from Jim Ortega and that's a
[20:40.540 --> 20:47.260]  80 seed bank stock and I'm real excited about that because that's you know just
[20:47.260 --> 20:53.660]  the fact that I can help share that into the gene pool again is just a good place
[20:53.660 --> 20:58.220]  to be yeah no it's awesome like I said I'm older and and the problem is that
[20:58.220 --> 21:01.300]  you have all these fond memories of stuff from a day when people try to tell
[21:01.300 --> 21:03.980]  you that you know that shit's outdated but I'm like I'm telling you no it's not
[21:03.980 --> 21:08.820]  and it's gone and so you pine for the memories in the past and when I see
[21:08.820 --> 21:11.860]  people digging things out I get excited because it lets me know that things are
[21:11.860 --> 21:15.900]  still alive and lets you also know that that your belief that trends
[21:15.900 --> 21:19.420]  continuously move forward roll and so it was cool to see the Northern Lights
[21:19.420 --> 21:23.420]  work you've been doing yeah yeah there was some of the first kind but that I
[21:23.420 --> 21:28.020]  got a chance to smoke when I was a kid and I just want to say something that's
[21:28.020 --> 21:32.380]  not quite on that topic but I wanted to get it out here to the everyone so when
[21:32.380 --> 21:37.260]  I first moved to the Emerald Triangle in 97 there was an amazing amount of
[21:37.260 --> 21:44.940]  genetics every farm had their own genetics amazing strains first there was
[21:44.940 --> 21:49.780]  a purple wave and then there was the OG diesel wave and basically a lot of farms
[21:49.780 --> 21:55.020]  stopped growing those original genetics just to sell their buddies here so they
[21:55.020 --> 22:00.460]  got on the purple bandwagon and they got on the gas bandwagon but you know
[22:00.460 --> 22:05.220]  the people still have the genetics here in the county it might be your neighbor
[22:05.220 --> 22:11.100]  it might be your family relatives whatever it is find those old seeds and
[22:11.100 --> 22:15.780]  get out and if you're not gonna work with them yourself give them to someone
[22:15.780 --> 22:20.540]  that will and let's try to preserve some of this amazing gene pool that's still
[22:20.540 --> 22:33.260]  intact around this county well that's a good segue to what you you asked about
[22:33.260 --> 22:38.060]  like some of the trends we're seeing in Washington and we're closed nothing
[22:38.060 --> 22:45.180]  comes in our little legal box right now and it's super unfortunate you know we
[22:45.180 --> 22:50.260]  can get stuff out for instance like how did I get that out I sold it to myself
[22:50.540 --> 22:55.180]  as a medical patient from my rec farm to me and then it can go out from there but
[22:55.180 --> 23:00.100]  I can't put anything back in so the trend has been really interesting right
[23:00.100 --> 23:03.820]  now I you know everyone's really excited that weed on the shelves is starting to
[23:03.820 --> 23:09.300]  look better but it's we're just so steps so far behind where we were before they
[23:09.300 --> 23:13.900]  killed medical you know the good weed on the shelves is just hydro weed and you
[23:13.900 --> 23:17.820]  could you open it up some of it smells good none of it tastes good you know I
[23:17.820 --> 23:20.420]  don't want to say none of it there's some good cultivators but you know kind
[23:20.420 --> 23:25.540]  of as I pervade the whole scene so yeah I don't know we're just seeing a lot of
[23:25.540 --> 23:28.660]  the hot stuff that comes through that people want to lash on to wedding cake
[23:28.660 --> 23:33.900]  you know cookies crosses but I do want to say it like I feel like you know we're
[23:33.900 --> 23:38.580]  a couple years ahead of you guys in this and it's that it's starting to turn you
[23:38.580 --> 23:42.900]  know we just had a couple of bills that came up to allow they're not voted in
[23:42.900 --> 23:48.620]  yet but to allow for small farmers to sell direct and the head of the LCB the
[23:48.620 --> 23:52.740]  liquor liquor cannabis board spoke twice publicly about being behind and this like
[23:52.740 --> 23:56.100]  I actually called these guys I like I'm like you got you know like this would
[23:56.100 --> 24:01.100]  save my family's life like ten days turn around like you know we'd pay our bills
[24:01.100 --> 24:04.100]  in ten days if I could sell this weed that I have here that people actually
[24:04.100 --> 24:09.380]  really want but when I go into the stores they go is it over 20% does it
[24:09.380 --> 24:15.020]  look like a cookie you know it's like I went I was I had a right I'll just kind
[24:15.020 --> 24:17.700]  of go off on this I had a really you know I don't want to be too negative but
[24:17.700 --> 24:21.060]  a hard experience this summer heads I brought in some you know I'm actually
[24:21.060 --> 24:25.260]  not in the retail market I've just been kind of like creeping along and so I
[24:25.260 --> 24:29.660]  brought some really beautiful Depp in to retail and I you know we do the whole
[24:29.660 --> 24:32.940]  thing so I package it I did all of it right I trimmed it I put in these jars
[24:33.100 --> 24:41.100]  one ounce jars two flavors garlic breath in the pie ho rough trimmed right $55
[24:41.100 --> 24:46.140]  it's in glass it's organic it's ungrown like what else can you want I even said
[24:46.140 --> 24:50.660]  hey man show me what you got in the price range you know 150 175 200 bucks
[24:50.660 --> 24:55.540]  on your shelf like what Oh Brown from last year yellow from last year like
[24:55.540 --> 24:58.860]  don't you think this looks better do you think it would sell that's not organic
[24:58.860 --> 25:03.900]  this you know nothing because all they want is that above 20% they want that
[25:03.900 --> 25:07.300]  fucking tight thing and they go with they go what else you got I go dude I
[25:07.300 --> 25:13.020]  grew all this weed I'm two miles from your store like I'm like the guy that on
[25:13.020 --> 25:16.420]  the TV that they want to talk about and he's like what else you got you got some
[25:16.420 --> 25:20.340]  sex lube you got some chapstick I'm like no bro I'll go make some sweatshirts
[25:20.340 --> 25:25.300]  like you know and but just kind of telling all that that like I feel like
[25:25.300 --> 25:29.500]  that's still coming big for you guys but you know we've been talking over and
[25:29.500 --> 25:32.100]  over again and we're just starting to see it so I'm personally feeling
[25:32.100 --> 25:36.980]  encouraged there's some some guys that just started a you know bought a license
[25:36.980 --> 25:43.500]  and they started with 16 lights and they got certified Dominion seed skunk and he
[25:43.500 --> 25:46.380]  came over and helped to make the selections and they're selling out
[25:46.380 --> 25:50.080]  they're crushing it everyone's talking about this little 16 light and they're
[25:50.080 --> 25:53.380]  just you know they're doing the thing we're talking about but just you know
[25:53.380 --> 25:58.620]  nano almost micro you know so that's kind of what I see coming for Washington
[25:58.620 --> 26:03.420]  is just kind of the slow slow thing and in and to be honest I'm waiting for
[26:03.420 --> 26:07.060]  another wave of it because the the federal curtain hasn't dropped and and
[26:07.060 --> 26:10.020]  then we haven't really talked about that yet but like the people who we think are
[26:10.020 --> 26:14.460]  big boys in California they might not be the big boys when the federal curtain
[26:14.460 --> 26:19.820]  drops you know Canada is I brought it up last night it's scary dude it's scary so
[26:19.820 --> 26:23.580]  it's just you know that's what how I see it is like we got to keep doing this
[26:23.580 --> 26:32.260]  coming together share with each other find a way to survive and yeah I feel
[26:32.260 --> 26:46.600]  you yeah this last year it's like traveling more and working in
[26:46.600 --> 26:51.160]  Switzerland and Africa as well and you have now Indian Columbia blowing up
[26:51.240 --> 26:56.720]  these people talking thousands of hectares this qualifies right now as
[26:56.720 --> 27:02.560]  hemp and it's that 0.03 percent Switzerland it's 1% Macedonia just
[27:02.560 --> 27:08.240]  opened up one and a half percent they use 0.03 percent as this baseline so
[27:08.240 --> 27:11.880]  this last year it was breeding seeds especially for the European market
[27:11.880 --> 27:18.560]  African market they want feminized auto flowers and it's just field planted and
[27:18.880 --> 27:22.800]  they're going in and harvesting with the combines they're just looking at it it's
[27:22.800 --> 27:29.760]  all going into isolate so you have this this market that is just CBD hungry and
[27:29.760 --> 27:36.040]  what qualifies that is this 0.03 percent these new cultivars though it's when to
[27:36.040 --> 27:40.480]  harvest them as well because we have time it's like you go at eight weeks and
[27:40.480 --> 27:44.200]  you're you're gonna be right under that hot point and all of a sudden you hit
[27:44.200 --> 27:48.800]  910 and some of these will jump up and depending on the climate and work you're
[27:48.800 --> 27:52.680]  taking tissue culture so you can have vitro coming from the US going to
[27:52.680 --> 27:57.400]  Switzerland all this the same culture and it's the way it's performing just
[27:57.400 --> 28:01.080]  like anything but its environment and then you look at the whole profile of
[28:01.080 --> 28:06.840]  the plant and this is how this is evolving so rapidly and right now it's
[28:06.840 --> 28:10.080]  this hemp thing after this farm bill passed especially here in the States
[28:10.200 --> 28:15.160]  it's on the scalability so that's the one thing with the CBD market right now
[28:15.160 --> 28:22.080]  here in the States it's this there's this huge demand last week the state in
[28:22.080 --> 28:25.800]  California they said that and this is something I don't know if it's been
[28:25.800 --> 28:31.800]  talked about or whatnot but is that male pollen is the state is looking regulators
[28:31.800 --> 28:38.880]  looking at it as a weapon this is something that the this is somebody that
[28:38.880 --> 28:41.960]  doesn't know what they're talking about but at that same time so what's that
[28:41.960 --> 28:46.320]  gonna do for a breeder to restrict you if you're gonna have a male plant that
[28:46.320 --> 28:51.440]  you can't flower that male pollen out or you're gonna you know these are things
[28:51.440 --> 28:56.000]  that are in California we are so regulated here like and you can go to
[28:56.000 --> 29:01.360]  Vermont right now in $25 permit if you have 500 acres you could plan it so what
[29:01.360 --> 29:05.840]  you know the it's a we're here dealing with we're dealing with the most intense
[29:06.000 --> 29:09.800]  adverse conditions pretty much on a global scale right now and especially
[29:09.800 --> 29:15.360]  here where we've spearheaded this movement so as things change it's like
[29:15.360 --> 29:18.640]  adapting here and that's the one thing it's like these new strains everybody
[29:18.640 --> 29:23.560]  has something unique here and it's that something differentiating you do have to
[29:23.560 --> 29:27.600]  feed into this you know the market what it dictates right now and the consumers
[29:27.600 --> 29:32.800]  is going to dictate what a farmer grows as well that's that's part of it so it's
[29:32.800 --> 29:42.480]  growing something that is from your heart do you do you see if in your
[29:42.480 --> 29:46.640]  opinion you know as genetics move globally product moves globally do you
[29:46.640 --> 29:51.280]  see material moving from one place to another specifically do you see
[29:51.280 --> 29:55.000]  individuals that you believe will become dominant in the production model is
[29:55.000 --> 30:00.240]  there opportunities for the US to move product globally you know I mean which
[30:00.240 --> 30:05.520]  it's an opinion question but you know how do you feel about it yeah and that's
[30:05.520 --> 30:09.360]  something right now we're falling behind very quickly especially with you know
[30:09.360 --> 30:13.200]  CBD and isolate and what they're able to produce in in Africa and these other
[30:13.200 --> 30:16.360]  countries and have these establishing these international markets with
[30:16.360 --> 30:21.000]  importing and exporting through through Canada through Australia through these
[30:21.000 --> 30:24.480]  other companies and a lot of these other businesses that they don't want to touch
[30:24.480 --> 30:28.640]  the US market there's enough profit they don't need to deal with the regulations
[30:28.680 --> 30:32.280]  so we've been getting seeds right now to try to get a true breeding seed
[30:32.280 --> 30:37.440]  regulated within the state of California or within these other states for export
[30:37.440 --> 30:41.520]  to go through and get your International Narcotics Bureau license for exporting
[30:41.520 --> 30:46.680]  we're behind and I don't know you know moving forward on that it takes the
[30:46.680 --> 30:51.720]  capital and and that's the thing we're talking of you know the the research and
[30:51.720 --> 30:57.440]  the capital behind it to move this forward requires help from private
[30:57.440 --> 31:01.680]  sector but also the academic sector and finding that here and especially
[31:01.680 --> 31:07.000]  California with the new hemp bill if you have an academic tie to a university
[31:07.000 --> 31:11.440]  we're gonna be able to allow to cultivate and breed hemp cannabis you
[31:11.440 --> 31:14.920]  know it's like growing the dank like that's where we're able to do right now
[31:14.920 --> 31:20.240]  is crossbreed to something you get that is just fire dank that it tests at that
[31:20.240 --> 31:26.360]  point 0.3% so it's him to explain that right now to the authorities and the
[31:26.360 --> 31:29.680]  powers would be they still don't wrap their head around it so let's breed the
[31:29.680 --> 31:33.080]  shit out of everything we can to get the dank out there and if it qualifies as
[31:33.080 --> 31:36.360]  hemp that's what they're gonna look at it they don't you know if you have the
[31:36.360 --> 31:40.960]  turps and you have a whole cannabinoid profile as long as it doesn't have THC
[31:40.960 --> 31:47.920]  in it it qualifies as him I always think that you know once the big guys get
[31:47.920 --> 31:51.640]  playing they're just gonna pay somebody to change that limit you know from point
[31:52.000 --> 31:56.920]  three to thirty it you know no I saw it where I asked a question to someone who
[31:56.920 --> 32:03.480]  was in hemp importation years ago for fabric and I was like why do you get the
[32:03.480 --> 32:08.520]  product from hungry and they said because they can use cultivars that have
[32:08.520 --> 32:15.000]  higher THC levels and we're allowed and the production quantity per square foot
[32:15.000 --> 32:19.920]  is increased they said that you can't get what we need as a production plant
[32:19.920 --> 32:24.160]  to give us a profitable product that has that lower THC percentage they
[32:24.160 --> 32:31.040]  didn't want the cannabinoids they wanted the biomass to do fabric and it was he
[32:31.040 --> 32:35.880]  was explaining to me how US was not a hemp leader in that because we weren't
[32:35.880 --> 32:41.760]  allowed to use the plants that had too high of a THC level and he said for some
[32:41.760 --> 32:46.160]  reason the plants that have the quality for fabric are just over that amount and
[32:46.560 --> 32:50.880]  he said and it just doesn't make sense to spend so much time trying to hunt it
[32:50.880 --> 32:54.800]  back when you could just go to hungry and they were pumping it out freely and
[32:54.800 --> 33:00.400]  I so it for them it worked because they needed it and I think that as time goes
[33:00.400 --> 33:04.760]  on you know the US would do it too it's just that in the way our model works it
[33:04.760 --> 33:08.960]  always seems to favor the wealthy you know and I think in hungry it was
[33:08.960 --> 33:12.720]  because they want to have business in general where they they needed to have
[33:12.720 --> 33:15.920]  this take place they needed it to happen and they said look if everybody's making
[33:15.920 --> 33:19.080]  money it's okay because some money is better than no money on a commercial
[33:19.080 --> 33:23.680]  industrial crop but to me the US is a different model and it's the same
[33:23.680 --> 33:28.280]  situation as you know when to when do we start to kind of get this together you
[33:28.280 --> 33:35.560]  for for you Graham what uh as you're as you're looking forward what is uh what's
[33:35.560 --> 33:39.080]  the what's a what's a direction you'd like to see yourself in a couple years
[33:39.080 --> 33:44.040]  just let's just let's just all pretend we're gonna make it because then it's
[33:44.040 --> 33:46.600]  easy right otherwise it's like I don't know if I'm gonna be here and I always
[33:46.600 --> 33:51.000]  tell people that I said I'm gonna be here now it's brutal but the fact is if
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.880]  I don't believe I'm gonna be here then I can't do long-term planning which you
[33:54.880 --> 33:57.960]  believed you're gonna be here because you've been banking stock for a long
[33:57.960 --> 34:02.200]  time what's uh what's something you'd like to see in a couple years for
[34:02.200 --> 34:07.440]  yourself well you know just personal desire as a breeder as a collector as a
[34:07.440 --> 34:13.680]  smoker cannabis culturalist so I'm definitely gonna be in the game in a few
[34:13.680 --> 34:19.080]  years I want to be still in Northern California in the Emerald Triangle
[34:19.080 --> 34:26.360]  ideally if I could stay here and make a living providing seeds to the community
[34:26.360 --> 34:31.260]  that would be my ideal so you know I know I feel you I don't want to go
[34:31.260 --> 34:34.520]  either I get asked to do a lot of international work and if I was younger
[34:34.520 --> 34:38.680]  and I didn't have family it wouldn't be bad but you know tripping around the
[34:38.680 --> 34:43.180]  world to do business as cool as it is it steals time from your life and it's been
[34:43.180 --> 34:47.100]  it's been a gift to be you know alive here and I mean I get the same goal too
[34:47.100 --> 34:51.500]  I just want to be able to stay here and work on the farm that I'm building and
[34:51.500 --> 34:56.060]  go into the genetic material that I've sourced all these years and be able to
[34:56.060 --> 35:00.060]  use that as trade to other people who have other things that are I'm interested
[35:00.060 --> 35:04.180]  in so I can start to continuously mine so that you know the majority of my life
[35:04.180 --> 35:08.620]  was spent doing the work that I love doing
[35:13.180 --> 35:19.620]  you got a farm you're building yeah I own my farm and it's been I mean for 10
[35:19.620 --> 35:24.700]  years I've been going after this a dream I have a dream and Canada's has been you
[35:24.700 --> 35:28.700]  know a big part of it but I was able to buy a farm when I bought my license and
[35:28.700 --> 35:34.020]  we have a son and I'm married and yeah I would like to just be doing a small
[35:34.020 --> 35:37.140]  farmer thing to be honest that's my dream I'd love to have people come out
[35:37.140 --> 35:42.340]  to my farm maybe on Saturday buy some weed and some vegetables once or twice a
[35:42.460 --> 35:47.100]  month in the summer do a big dinner and like feed some people and like showcase
[35:47.100 --> 35:50.820]  like I like to get into stuff I love beer I love making beer I love roasting
[35:50.820 --> 35:55.220]  coffee I actually want to set up a tropical greenhouse I grow a lot of
[35:55.220 --> 35:59.540]  lemons and stuff and just I want to get into Karen me didn't like I'm just a
[35:59.540 --> 36:03.860]  dork and I want to do that and like kind of you know nothing big just like just
[36:03.860 --> 36:07.180]  have fun and showcase what I like to do and make enough money that I can you
[36:07.180 --> 36:10.940]  know live a good life I'd ideally like to only work 30 hours a week to be
[36:10.940 --> 36:20.180]  honest you know the fantasy yeah yeah fantasy next couple years where do you
[36:20.180 --> 36:25.220]  see yourself going well develop the farm here in Mendocino County and want to
[36:25.220 --> 36:28.900]  move forward with the nursery on that and just mainly R&D but being able to
[36:28.900 --> 36:33.620]  work with more the academic community and like work like with Eleanor here
[36:33.620 --> 36:37.500]  like the Canada or what they're doing with this barium and starting to take
[36:37.500 --> 36:42.340]  this initiative to actually like it's almost like starting over again but
[36:42.340 --> 36:48.140]  these are this is like that learning process along the way and here in
[36:48.140 --> 36:52.260]  California it's just and especially unlike these large pheno hunts and like
[36:52.260 --> 36:56.580]  with Nat it's like this is something you know being able to work on this on large
[36:56.580 --> 36:59.900]  scales and that's the only thing that's limiting in California right now and in
[36:59.900 --> 37:04.900]  the States is we need hundreds of acres with hundreds of thousands of seeds and
[37:04.940 --> 37:09.860]  being able to do these large select through large populations and at this
[37:09.860 --> 37:14.220]  time in California it's rather difficult so looking at other locations to be able
[37:14.220 --> 37:22.300]  to do this and then bring the seed back here so it's these new discoveries
[37:22.300 --> 37:25.660]  they're out there you know there's the white elephants and the golden unicorns
[37:25.660 --> 37:30.660]  and something there's a lot that we still have to be still out there and
[37:30.660 --> 37:34.860]  especially these old strains they're starting to be reintroduced where people
[37:34.860 --> 37:37.380]  are looking at it sort of like the grinspoon I don't know if you've ever
[37:37.380 --> 37:41.220]  grown that one it's like just you're looking at it's like why am I growing it
[37:41.220 --> 37:45.540]  but it's such a special little plant and what it has in it and it's like what
[37:45.540 --> 37:49.860]  extracts and whatnot but it's something that doesn't look the best why are you
[37:49.860 --> 37:54.620]  growing this but it's like what's it got inside yeah no that much that's if I had
[37:54.620 --> 37:58.460]  like a multi-year dream it would be that the the population that buys cannabis
[37:58.460 --> 38:02.100]  starts to really have a an understanding of what they're buying so
[38:02.100 --> 38:05.220]  they can actually start to have real product differentiation and you can
[38:05.220 --> 38:09.140]  start to have the subsets the sub markets create to have you have
[38:09.140 --> 38:13.020]  individuals that specialize in certain things so it lets the farms work lines
[38:13.020 --> 38:19.460]  and develop the ability to have true appellation like standardization where
[38:19.460 --> 38:23.940]  in this region these things have been sorted out to do best and you can only
[38:23.940 --> 38:28.300]  get these things in this region and it allows the regions not to have to go
[38:28.300 --> 38:32.100]  head-to-head for who's got the best gelato but each one of these regions has
[38:32.100 --> 38:38.220]  something that's uniquely distinct to that specific place and what it what to
[38:38.220 --> 38:41.220]  me what it'll do is it allow you to start to have you know true long-term
[38:41.220 --> 38:44.540]  preservation because if we're just the beginning of an industry and when I look
[38:44.540 --> 38:49.900]  at liquor I'm like wow you got 70 80 years you guys been sparking up what are
[38:49.900 --> 38:52.780]  we gonna be doing in 80 years you know and if we can do the building blocks of
[38:52.780 --> 38:55.860]  it now and start to create some of that stuff you actually have the tools to go
[38:55.860 --> 38:59.180]  forward because even though science takes over many things there's always a
[38:59.180 --> 39:02.940]  renaissance and there's always an outlaw there's always the renegade that wants
[39:02.940 --> 39:06.940]  to buck that and do it their own way and they're the ones that always brought the
[39:06.940 --> 39:15.260]  wild shit forward and that's what I hope to see too. About advice to collectors
[39:15.260 --> 39:19.860]  and breeders from someone who's done a lot of work and held a lot of work what
[39:19.860 --> 39:24.540]  do you recommend to people for just how do you do it you know? On keeping
[39:24.540 --> 39:30.460]  clones is just don't give up you know it's difficult during you know moves and
[39:30.460 --> 39:37.220]  shit it's just you just got to keep the focus and don't give up and always make
[39:37.220 --> 39:40.780]  sure your cuts are rooted before you take your next mom and stick her in the
[39:40.780 --> 39:46.740]  flowering room or killer or whatever you're gonna do and then as far as
[39:46.820 --> 39:53.500]  breeding just don't breed with cookies.
[39:54.900 --> 39:59.900]  Breed with something that's true to your heart and try to bring something
[39:59.900 --> 40:09.380]  different to the gene pool. The question was you know you know how do you like
[40:09.380 --> 40:15.180]  for you you've maintained the ATF for a long time and the the question for
[40:15.180 --> 40:18.540]  people is like you know how did you maintain it what's some advice you have
[40:18.540 --> 40:21.500]  for people like when I'm when I'm someone who do it was it does what I do
[40:21.500 --> 40:24.940]  which is hold libraries for time and move material for time I always tell
[40:24.940 --> 40:30.340]  people redundant copies and make sure you give it to people that have an
[40:30.340 --> 40:34.740]  appreciation for that thing they're not big collectors they only want to hold
[40:34.740 --> 40:39.540]  one or two varietals because they will not lose them you give it to people who
[40:39.540 --> 40:43.220]  want a mass library that stuff gets lost and so I always tell people you got to
[40:43.220 --> 40:47.180]  find people who care about the variety so much that all they want to do is hold
[40:47.180 --> 40:51.060]  that one variety and I've lost varieties for years and I've had people
[40:51.060 --> 40:55.500]  contact me and let me know man I'm just so happy with what I have and I go what
[40:55.500 --> 40:59.140]  do you got and they go the stuff you gave me all those years ago and I go you
[40:59.140 --> 41:05.580]  still got this stuff and I realized I can remine that shaft and get those
[41:05.580 --> 41:09.820]  valuable goodies back out because I've lost them through for whatever you can
[41:09.820 --> 41:14.300]  only hold so much stuff and it's the redundant sharing and it's choosing who
[41:14.300 --> 41:19.020]  you have hold the plants people that just want everything don't have an
[41:19.020 --> 41:22.980]  appreciation they just want bulk collection and if you are a professional
[41:22.980 --> 41:26.060]  your bulk collections in a different form because usually you have people to
[41:26.060 --> 41:30.580]  help you with it or more stabilized infrastructure so you can keep it but
[41:30.580 --> 41:34.140]  for me if you want to hold a specific varietal for time get two or three
[41:34.140 --> 41:37.180]  people who just love that varietal and it's all they want to grow because
[41:37.180 --> 41:41.580]  that's what works for them and then what you have is a redundant bank in multiple
[41:41.580 --> 41:45.860]  locations of unconnected people so that you don't get caught up in a law
[41:45.860 --> 41:52.340]  enforcement jam and you all lose your gear or you don't get caught up in where
[41:52.340 --> 41:56.100]  it got lost because the person just didn't need it anymore so they got rid
[41:56.100 --> 41:59.780]  of it they wouldn't get rid of it because that's what they use you know
[41:59.780 --> 42:03.420]  and so that's how I try to make sure I can keep material alive is to share it
[42:03.420 --> 42:08.340]  with individuals who have a commitment to the cut and then hopefully we can do
[42:08.340 --> 42:12.420]  some kind of outcross or self it to hold material so at least we have some
[42:12.420 --> 42:16.980]  genetic preservation of it but for you you held an ATF cut for a long time you
[42:16.980 --> 42:23.860]  know that was it I mean you need though you kept it because of money you know it
[42:23.860 --> 42:28.740]  was like that's a good reason yeah we my buddy bought it for 4,000 you know just
[42:28.740 --> 42:32.580]  for the cut back in the day and we were laughing at him you know and then we
[42:32.580 --> 42:35.500]  started making money on it you know is this three of us doing this little you
[42:35.500 --> 42:38.660]  know start out thing and we just kind of looked each other in the eyes said it
[42:38.660 --> 42:41.620]  you know it doesn't ever go past the three of us and we kept it that way
[42:41.620 --> 42:45.940]  actually we agreed to give it to one other guy and he's the only one that
[42:45.940 --> 42:49.140]  held it after a while because we all you know ran it for years and years and it's
[42:49.140 --> 42:53.220]  kind of like all right they're sick you know I've been given this one dude ATF
[42:53.220 --> 42:56.500]  for five years and he's kind of getting sick of it you know but we always at
[42:56.500 --> 43:01.180]  work so anyways I had done some moving you know around and I was able to get it
[43:01.180 --> 43:05.820]  back and it still does really well and so now I'm at now I need to start like
[43:05.820 --> 43:08.460]  saving it because I've realized the value in it you know it's kind of like
[43:08.460 --> 43:11.900]  one of those right next to me doing you know the workhorse for me and I haven't
[43:11.900 --> 43:15.660]  really given it as much appreciation you know because I've I'm really excited
[43:15.660 --> 43:19.500]  about new things and kind of like oh you know going around but luckily I had some
[43:19.500 --> 43:22.620]  buddies that were just doing work just making money you know and so they didn't
[43:22.620 --> 43:28.180]  care they just you know but I but as I've gotten into legalization and
[43:28.180 --> 43:31.820]  everything's stable it's like when you were saying that man through the moves
[43:31.820 --> 43:36.580]  it was like oh god I'm so glad I don't have to move again I'm so glad I can
[43:36.580 --> 43:41.060]  have as many damn plants as I want like it's a relief because it's such a it is
[43:41.060 --> 43:44.980]  very hard to move it's very hard to ship a clone it's all the stuff is like you
[43:44.980 --> 43:50.460]  know people don't realize the you know it's hard especially because you in
[43:50.460 --> 43:54.340]  order for it to have any time in between tending you have to have it in a pot
[43:54.540 --> 43:59.020]  size big enough or a system that has enough capacity to take care of it
[43:59.020 --> 44:02.380]  otherwise you're having to make sure that you're constantly doing it and if
[44:02.380 --> 44:07.660]  your life gets bumpy you end up coming home and seeing a you know a rack of
[44:07.660 --> 44:11.220]  dead animal and you just like that didn't work well that's honestly why I
[44:11.220 --> 44:14.580]  hit him up because I heard you know him him rapping on some other stuff and I
[44:14.580 --> 44:19.380]  was just like man that's impressive like you got to be a solid grower some solid
[44:19.380 --> 44:23.300]  skills you got to be really disciplined to like stock all that stuff and yet
[44:23.300 --> 44:26.740]  it's a service to the community like it's some you know thank you for like
[44:26.740 --> 44:31.500]  you know and not to others that like do that work and librarian yeah yeah I know
[44:31.500 --> 44:34.620]  the librarians get and things I know it's all the guys that are good
[44:34.620 --> 44:39.260]  librarians they're wary because everybody wants to borrow your books but
[44:39.260 --> 44:41.980]  they don't give a shit about bringing them back and they just want to take
[44:41.980 --> 44:44.820]  them and copy them and pull the cover off and put their own cover on it and
[44:44.820 --> 44:48.940]  they don't want to give any credit to the varietal itself so it's like a
[44:48.940 --> 44:54.220]  disrespect to the plant that did it I look at plants in some respects
[44:54.220 --> 44:58.460]  different because I I call this old a K cut the cut that bought my house and
[44:58.460 --> 45:02.540]  whenever I look at my home I will always think of that plant because that was the
[45:02.540 --> 45:08.020]  plant that I used to buy the home I live in that plant was so valuable that I
[45:08.020 --> 45:15.020]  could generate enough funds from it to put a house that my kids live in and you
[45:15.020 --> 45:17.940]  have like a different emotional connection to it and when you see people
[45:17.940 --> 45:21.220]  just kicking it like it's you know a piece of trash you want to kick him in
[45:21.220 --> 45:27.380]  the ass yourself and that but that's what drives you to hold and keep for you
[45:27.380 --> 45:31.020]  you know are you are you doing a lot of banking I know you involved in in a
[45:31.020 --> 45:35.500]  tremendous amount of scientific work are you are you holding stuff in in in vitro
[45:35.500 --> 45:39.540]  form still you stay holding stuff yeah that's vitro right now is the focus and
[45:39.540 --> 45:45.740]  that's working on that here that's where on right now in Switzerland they're much
[45:45.940 --> 45:48.900]  more ahead even in Africa with what they're doing it's like they're even
[45:48.900 --> 45:53.460]  taking mails and putting them in the library so we're going through and
[45:53.460 --> 45:57.660]  trying to keep our hands on everything right now and alive and it allows that
[45:57.660 --> 46:04.020]  to do that it's just being able to share that and to this point we're saying as
[46:04.020 --> 46:10.460]  well as this being responsible of carrying on that torch but giving the
[46:10.460 --> 46:15.260]  people that's worked with that to move it forward to where you have it and that
[46:15.260 --> 46:18.700]  goes back to even like on some of this all these older strains it's like the
[46:18.700 --> 46:22.980]  indigenous people that like from Panama or you have the you know these different
[46:22.980 --> 46:26.540]  African scenes that were have been kept alive and then they're going in somebody
[46:26.540 --> 46:30.980]  else's hands who when it was criminal it's like this sort of like with Neville
[46:30.980 --> 46:35.020]  and you know we look at the baseline of genetics and like Sam the skunk man and
[46:35.020 --> 46:38.740]  you go back to the Hayes brothers here and these genetics that originated here
[46:38.740 --> 46:43.460]  that went back to Amsterdam and then kind of have floated around but this
[46:43.460 --> 46:49.700]  basic gene pool this is what we're working with and to be able to share
[46:49.700 --> 46:53.180]  that information and know stuff like Neville like with what you like with
[46:53.180 --> 46:57.980]  what you're working with these different old cultivars and being able to share
[46:57.980 --> 47:03.340]  that as well because there's and this is why vitro is really good right now I
[47:03.340 --> 47:07.220]  know you've been working with it as well but the other thing with it as well as
[47:07.220 --> 47:11.860]  being able to transport the germplasm you know yeah yeah much more stable
[47:11.980 --> 47:16.940]  format and in a much more efficient way to move it and I'm not sure about you
[47:16.940 --> 47:21.060]  know regulatory stuff but in terms of moving things in general it's always
[47:21.060 --> 47:27.220]  better when it's preserved protected and compact yeah and that's that's something
[47:27.220 --> 47:32.660]  as in vitro with experience right now they don't really question it as even
[47:32.660 --> 47:37.420]  you know it's with shipping but with the right permits right now and that's what
[47:37.420 --> 47:42.140]  qualifying as hemp and doing your due diligence to have lab results right now
[47:42.140 --> 47:46.060]  then it's being able to share that and put it at different locations like
[47:46.060 --> 47:51.700]  throughout the world and let somebody else propagate in different areas and
[47:51.700 --> 47:55.220]  that's something like in this area it's like you have something from Mendocino
[47:55.220 --> 47:59.260]  that's performing well out on the coast that's really resilient but yet won't do
[47:59.260 --> 48:05.180]  well in the in you know in inland areas so it's like are you seeing are you
[48:05.180 --> 48:10.340]  seeing pockets of material in Africa that still goes back in time like that
[48:10.340 --> 48:15.060]  hasn't had the Dutch infiltration that see like when I when I was over in
[48:15.060 --> 48:21.180]  Hawaii in the in the mid 80s it was the last of the Southeast Asian varietals
[48:21.180 --> 48:25.020]  grown in the cane fields and so I go there and I get to experience some
[48:25.020 --> 48:30.620]  world-class cannabis and it was perfect because the soils the climate all
[48:30.780 --> 48:36.460]  matched up with those type of plants and so you had this incredible combination
[48:36.460 --> 48:41.660]  and then I go back you know years and years later and I got this this white kid
[48:41.660 --> 48:45.220]  that's telling me about you need to check out the Aloha white widow and I
[48:45.220 --> 48:48.260]  was like that's not what I'm looking for I'm looking for the Cambodian that used
[48:48.260 --> 48:50.820]  to grow out here that used to take top your head off make you almost pee your
[48:50.820 --> 48:55.380]  pants you had to sit on the toilet smoke it where's that and they were like oh no
[48:55.380 --> 48:59.060]  no you want the white widow and I'm like no I don't want the white widow I know
[48:59.060 --> 49:01.860]  what the white widow is like what I want is the things that were from here
[49:01.860 --> 49:08.060]  did did Africa have the ability to hold material in constant do you still have
[49:08.060 --> 49:12.340]  to look as someone who's discovering stock because to me I'm like Afghanistan
[49:12.340 --> 49:18.420]  got hammered all over Asia got hammered from war Africa had so much war and
[49:18.420 --> 49:22.500]  famine and issues as you're mining material you stay able to mine some of
[49:22.500 --> 49:27.740]  that killer stuff from the past or is it it's getting polluted quickly it really
[49:27.740 --> 49:31.620]  is it's hard to find like I was in this last year went to through Ethiopia and
[49:31.620 --> 49:36.380]  then the Seychelles Islands right there and it's even finding these old land
[49:36.380 --> 49:39.220]  races where all of a sudden it's like oh these guys were here from Amsterdam a
[49:39.220 --> 49:44.980]  couple years ago and we have a white widow mango that we open pollinated with
[49:44.980 --> 49:49.940]  all our land right stuff so all of a sudden this what's happening is it's
[49:49.940 --> 49:53.900]  harder and harder to find from from Africa and that was years ago Southeast
[49:54.100 --> 50:00.340]  Asia you know I traveled through Vietnam Cambodia Lao Thailand area trying to and
[50:00.340 --> 50:05.060]  then even that was mid 90s and you're still running across places where people
[50:05.060 --> 50:09.500]  had brought other genetics in so this is one thing going back in this
[50:09.500 --> 50:14.780]  diversification and being able to keep things from there from the origin you
[50:14.780 --> 50:22.940]  know Southeast Asia India Africa and keep these genetics separate and being
[50:22.940 --> 50:27.580]  able to do to do testing and that's like the kind of the back step of
[50:27.580 --> 50:31.780]  documenting this but like yeah Africa it's it's anywhere in the world right
[50:31.780 --> 50:36.420]  now it's like Irian Jaya Papua New Guinea you're going there in these areas
[50:36.420 --> 50:43.820]  people have been there with cannabis or him it's amazing because you know for me
[50:43.820 --> 50:47.460]  for my background from being in cannabis when it was coming over from all these
[50:47.460 --> 50:52.180]  places throughout the year in cycle it just let me experience a range of
[50:52.180 --> 50:57.420]  effects that I don't experience now I call most of the stuff we play with now
[50:57.420 --> 51:02.140]  homogenized cannabis and what I want is I want to be able to have these unique
[51:02.140 --> 51:10.860]  directions to fit what I want to do and how I want to feel and I if people try
[51:10.860 --> 51:14.300]  to tell me that you know it's your imagination that you're dreaming that
[51:14.300 --> 51:17.540]  things will better at that time and I said oh no no they had unbelievable
[51:17.540 --> 51:21.180]  effects and the directions were phenomenal and they were very unique in
[51:21.180 --> 51:25.100]  the way they sent and how you made you feel and you just you don't see this
[51:25.100 --> 51:28.580]  except in some very rare cultivars so we see stuff that's highly marketable and a
[51:28.580 --> 51:31.940]  quality but like you know you working with some of that stuff the Panama's I
[51:31.940 --> 51:36.900]  remember some killer Panama's that were just thumping and the the flavor
[51:36.900 --> 51:41.380]  profiles were unique and the way it made you feel was unique and the problem is
[51:41.380 --> 51:44.540]  that as soon as we started to hybridize it down so that it would work in our
[51:44.540 --> 51:48.340]  climates as soon as we started to try to bring it indoor we basically just
[51:48.340 --> 51:53.260]  started calling it out of existence and we dumbed it down we turn the qualities
[51:53.260 --> 51:57.260]  down and if you know for me when I try to get when I meet people that like you
[51:57.260 --> 52:00.020]  like I've known you for a long time but I know that you're you know you scouring
[52:00.020 --> 52:03.820]  the earth and I'm always like did you find some goodies someplace you know is
[52:03.820 --> 52:08.140]  the goodies still remaining somewhere and and and unfortunately the goodies
[52:08.140 --> 52:11.060]  are out there but they're just not market you know for the for the most
[52:11.060 --> 52:17.060]  part but the some of these cultivars that take 14 weeks that the flower
[52:17.060 --> 52:23.460]  still 14 weeks is like a football and it hasn't filled in but but this is
[52:23.460 --> 52:27.180]  something that it's good to have in the toolbox you know let's not get let's not
[52:27.180 --> 52:32.860]  get let this go and I think right now that's these different unique cultivars
[52:32.860 --> 52:37.380]  that we run into it's keep it alive or share it with somebody else that you
[52:37.380 --> 52:41.600]  know it's like that it's that cannabinoids that feed your endo
[52:41.600 --> 52:44.700]  cannabinoids you know everybody's different and that's that's the thing
[52:44.700 --> 52:50.060]  something that one strain it's like is that could be that key that helps you
[52:50.060 --> 52:53.220]  like with epilepsy it's three to five percent right of people that are
[52:53.220 --> 52:58.260]  affected by say Charlotte's Web but what are the cannabinoids within that cultivar
[52:58.260 --> 53:02.820]  that are accessing your endo cannabinoid profile and that's something collecting
[53:02.820 --> 53:09.620]  big data right now going into this on the pharmacogenetic level is identifying
[53:09.620 --> 53:16.660]  these genetics plant genetics and then a person's makeup and seeing that 80
[53:16.660 --> 53:22.220]  year old lady that's in Australia that just got help from a certain profile and
[53:22.220 --> 53:26.180]  helped her epilepsy epilepsy and then you have a three-year-old child in
[53:26.180 --> 53:32.260]  America or somewhere else that you'd never know that this particular balance
[53:32.260 --> 53:35.740]  of a one-to-one fight and that's something working one and was finding
[53:35.740 --> 53:40.500]  these old land races from from Africa as well but developing a full cannabinoid
[53:40.500 --> 53:49.260]  profile you know I'm talking like 5% THC 5 CBD 5 CBN CBG CBD V THC V flatline
[53:49.260 --> 53:52.980]  across the board or these different profiles and then when you identify a
[53:52.980 --> 54:00.180]  cultivar like that being able to put it in vitro and put that on the show so
[54:00.180 --> 54:04.580]  we're good on time we got a little bit of time for some questions great great
[54:04.580 --> 54:08.900]  so you guys got some questions shoot them while you're here why did why did
[54:08.900 --> 54:13.580]  import weed stop coming in the country import weed stopped coming in the
[54:13.580 --> 54:19.140]  country primarily because I was somebody that was involved in the enforcement of
[54:19.140 --> 54:25.140]  this and so what it was was it was a function of size and so when the people
[54:25.140 --> 54:29.140]  were shipping drugs into America and in brown 1980 is when the door really got
[54:29.140 --> 54:35.220]  shut the the difficulty to ship a product into the US became much more
[54:35.220 --> 54:40.820]  difficult and it is a lot easier to ship a suitcase full of cocaine than a truck
[54:40.820 --> 54:46.860]  load of cannabis and a suitcase full of opium is a lot easier to ship than a
[54:46.860 --> 54:51.540]  truckload of cannabis and so it was a function of the economy and the US
[54:51.540 --> 54:57.220]  instantly kicked up its domestic production to make up for it it's just
[54:57.220 --> 55:00.740]  that what we did is we lost you know the access to a lot of these incredible
[55:00.740 --> 55:05.340]  type effects and highs and the tones that were there were also about the
[55:05.340 --> 55:10.300]  experiences you got when you smoked it and the people in the United States are
[55:10.300 --> 55:16.620]  in their own paradigm America's its own little planet and so it just skewed it
[55:16.620 --> 55:20.340]  and then after a couple of years basically nothing was coming in on any
[55:20.340 --> 55:23.580]  quantity it got to the point where America was really jamming the whole
[55:23.580 --> 55:27.100]  Mexican drug trade because we were producing so much herb up here in
[55:27.100 --> 55:31.580]  Northern California that it was really cutting back on the amount of money made
[55:31.580 --> 55:35.980]  in Mexico and if you talk to people in Mexico you can talk to villages and
[55:35.980 --> 55:39.540]  they're like oh man when they when you guys started really lighting up heavy
[55:39.540 --> 55:43.420]  you financially broke us because we didn't realize that it wasn't just
[55:43.420 --> 55:47.860]  cartels moving weed it was villages moving weed and that the cartel may have
[55:47.860 --> 55:52.700]  been the trafficker but the villager was the producer and so we started becoming
[55:52.820 --> 55:57.060]  competitors with the Mexican farmer and we didn't really understand that for
[55:57.060 --> 56:00.420]  them it was life and death because they didn't have alternative forms of money
[56:00.420 --> 56:05.100]  the cannabis was their money you can't just come up growing weed and you also
[56:05.100 --> 56:10.500]  can't collect weed if you don't have a license you can only have six plants and
[56:10.500 --> 56:14.500]  so I always throw six plants out there for enjoyment but oh my god how the hell
[56:14.500 --> 56:20.100]  do you bank varietals for time and breed and reproduce when you're only legally
[56:20.180 --> 56:25.180]  allowed six and so it forces everyone to go right back into a criminal status and
[56:25.180 --> 56:28.340]  someone's like yeah it's only a misdemeanor but I'm like the point is
[56:28.340 --> 56:32.500]  that it's still a criminal status and you get would get your product seized
[56:32.500 --> 56:36.180]  and so you don't have an ability to hold a living collection unless you have a
[56:36.180 --> 56:43.620]  permit and for most people man that's no small trick. Answer your question? Right on.
[56:43.620 --> 56:48.100]  He's asking what's the major differences between the Northern Lights cuts you
[56:48.100 --> 56:51.940]  hold because they're all named with numerics what's the significance of
[56:51.940 --> 57:00.510]  that and what does it mean to you and how you use them? So that's a very good
[57:00.510 --> 57:06.070]  question so we would really need the guys here that originally bred the
[57:06.070 --> 57:11.350]  Northern Lights strains to answer all these questions but from what I've read
[57:11.350 --> 57:16.990]  and understand and what I've heard through the cannabis culture is Northern
[57:17.030 --> 57:28.190]  Lights number one is the pure form, two, three were crossed to Indica's and L5, 6, 7, 8, 9
[57:28.190 --> 57:35.990]  were crossed to Sativa's to hybridize. NL5 has the best bag peel and the best
[57:35.990 --> 57:47.550]  marketable bud. NL2 has the strongest most Indica, a lot of juniper just real
[57:47.550 --> 57:54.790]  cush smell. Northern Lights number one is the backbone of all the other ones you
[57:54.790 --> 58:02.030]  can smell it in there it was the building block it's what Neville used if
[58:02.150 --> 58:06.390]  he had a clone and he wanted to recreate that clone he that was the male he used
[58:06.390 --> 58:11.510]  when he wanted to make a pure hash plant off the hash plant cutting he back
[58:11.510 --> 58:16.550]  crossed off of the Northern Lights number one when he wanted to bring big
[58:16.550 --> 58:21.110]  bud to the market and he just had the big bud clone he back crossed off of
[58:21.110 --> 58:26.750]  Northern Lights number one it's in it's a real building block as far as it by
[58:26.750 --> 58:34.190]  itself it's great smoke but it doesn't have the bag appeal. That answer your
[58:34.190 --> 58:39.190]  question? Thanks man. Any other questions?
[58:39.630 --> 58:45.190]  Yeah, shoot we'll get you next. He's saying how do you go from bag appeal to smoke
[58:45.190 --> 58:52.590]  appeal an actual reality and and where everyone screams education but if you
[58:52.590 --> 58:57.270]  want to get an education in America you're gonna go broke so the the issue
[58:57.270 --> 59:00.910]  with education in our situation is to be able to have some loosening of the
[59:00.910 --> 59:06.350]  regulation that allows you to have events where individuals can come and
[59:06.350 --> 59:10.510]  meet cultivators and then cultivators can then be able to sit down and
[59:10.510 --> 59:15.390]  casually without trying to sell them product expose them to what they have
[59:15.390 --> 59:20.830]  and then they can also explain to them why they like it where's it shine most
[59:20.870 --> 59:26.190]  people who smoke you remember most people nowadays can't roll a joint I
[59:26.190 --> 59:30.870]  sell cone rollers and stuff and I personally don't like a filter so I'm
[59:30.870 --> 59:34.150]  somebody who likes to taste the weed in his mouth so cardboard in the mouth just
[59:34.150 --> 59:38.750]  doesn't do it for me the same way but that's because that's what I know but I
[59:38.750 --> 59:45.230]  realized that nobody can roll a joint anymore they they they use devices to
[59:45.230 --> 59:49.950]  smoke and when you're using a bong or glass and you're torturing it with the
[59:49.950 --> 59:53.790]  loiter and you're burning that shit burnability is an issue but when you're
[59:53.790 --> 59:58.870]  smoking it in a tube it's definitely an issue and that's where the pre-rolls
[59:58.870 --> 01:00:03.390]  people don't have issues because by the time you smoke it it's dry so the
[01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:08.390]  combustibility is incredible but you're lacking the quality of flavor and so
[01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:13.510]  there's this this reality of why are you putting the product on the market and
[01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:19.510]  the people who buy the product have to understand this is the truth that
[01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:23.630]  these things are on the market same thing when you explain to people why the
[01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:29.190]  tomato is on the table because it fits in a lug and why does the Cavendish
[01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:34.470]  banana sold compared to other bananas because lo and behold it doesn't need
[01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:38.870]  refrigeration when you ship it it tastes good enough and it doesn't require
[01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:43.950]  refrigeration so those financial concerns dictate the consumption reality
[01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:47.990]  and when people say education people like all people are going to be doing
[01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:50.910]  education like yeah people who trying to make money who don't know what
[01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:57.030]  they're doing when I see people in Napa running terpene seminars and and I'm
[01:00:57.030 --> 01:01:01.310]  looking I'm like roll me a joint and now that doesn't mean you're legit but if
[01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:05.670]  you can't even break up some weed the amount of weed you've handled in your
[01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:11.430]  life is probably pretty small so you're the last person I'm gonna ask for for an
[01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:15.310]  in-person demonstration on how to appreciate cannabis you might be an
[01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:20.230]  incredible scientist and you can explain to me why I get the response and reaction
[01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:24.230]  I do from what I'm doing but you're not the one I'm asking for turn me on to
[01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:28.510]  good grass and that's what we need is we need people like yourselves that are
[01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:32.550]  career smokers career growers who can appreciate quality and you can sit down
[01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:37.990]  with customers in a cannabis manner which is non-aggressive and let them try
[01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:41.510]  it and then you can say look see this is nuggie and it works and we sell it for
[01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:46.590]  this but personally we smoke this looser looking hay like weed because for
[01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:51.750]  me that you know the the quality the high is is perfect and they go how do I
[01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:55.190]  buy stuff like that and then you go all right now we need to figure out how do
[01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:58.710]  we get it to you and that's try to work out the supply chain like we talked
[01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:02.110]  about this morning but once you get customers that want your product you're
[01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:07.030]  no longer pushing drugs they are pulling drugs and there's a radical difference
[01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:12.870]  in business velocity when that happens I'm asking Bob some good questions I
[01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:19.350]  was calling Bob says his nickname everybody had a nickname I I always
[01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:24.190]  fascinated with when I met him he was somebody who was explaining to me the
[01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:29.390]  varieties he held and he was going through the chain of custody in a manner
[01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:33.110]  that made me laugh and I said how the fuck do you remember that many names of
[01:02:33.110 --> 01:02:38.790]  who held it because it was so conscientious and that's why when I was
[01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:42.550]  saying to him how do you hold material because it's it's these little things I
[01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:47.710]  notice in people that I don't think other people understand about what
[01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:52.190]  drives you to do it and what level of desire and for Josh you know humble guy
[01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:57.030]  fantastic highly knowledgeable gardener in a market that's insane and I wanted
[01:02:57.030 --> 01:03:01.710]  him to be able to explain you know how do you integrate those worlds because
[01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:05.910]  he's a superior farmer and for Hardy it's it the questions that I wanted to
[01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:11.270]  get out of him were you know using your knowledge of the current scientific
[01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:16.990]  situation in the global situation what's your thoughts on it and from that point
[01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:21.070]  man there's a trillion questions you could ask and so shit I mean I think we
[01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:24.110]  covered what I wanted to see the question is there's something that you
[01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:28.750]  want to know you know is there something you feel that you could ask any one of
[01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:32.430]  these people to get a little bit of direction and that's really the truth of
[01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:34.550]  it
[01:03:34.550 --> 01:03:42.070]  my question was you've done a lot of research with different varieties from
[01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:47.630]  all around the world what have you found your most recent research as different
[01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:52.670]  gravity size to the exceed that you've been able to increase the level on or
[01:03:52.670 --> 01:04:00.150]  finding some potential that's the variance through there was you know I
[01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:03.750]  don't know if you're familiar with it with Doug's there and and then finding
[01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:10.790]  the you know this this lineage of where it came from and then and bringing that
[01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:16.710]  bringing that out that's a particular strain though that is not appealing as
[01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:24.310]  well so it's been one that has taken a lot of time and money and patience to
[01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:30.430]  move it forward and it has moved forward in like when you see a two to three
[01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:35.030]  percent gain in those cannabinoids it seems like it's been significant with
[01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:39.670]  the with the variance more so than THC being able to take something in a couple
[01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:44.230]  back crosses we're getting it up to above 20% and these desirable terpenes
[01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:49.270]  but yeah to that point it's the the variance that we've been looking at to
[01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:58.230]  increase eight right now so it's getting that over that 10% right there and it's
[01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:02.950]  it's yeah and it's a lot of testing you know this is something it's you can have
[01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:06.990]  that same phenotype and that same expression and something you know
[01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:12.110]  back-crossed up to even we've seen you know as far as with the variances is you
[01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:16.150]  know you're going to six generations and while all of a sudden out of a hundred
[01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:21.870]  tests do you see these all of a sudden you see an outlier spike where it's
[01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:26.350]  going up above even 1% 2% and then there are these outliers that will shoot up to
[01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:30.990]  above over five and then it's how many tests we have to run before we get that
[01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:37.590]  ten do you see when you're when I've noticed sometimes that when we're
[01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:41.030]  looking for specific cannabinoids and we're trying to run them there seems to
[01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:45.270]  be a blockage from other cannabinoids is almost like the plants competing with
[01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:50.190]  what it's going to produce and so when you're when you're working with THC V
[01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:54.310]  which is just so trendy right now are you seeing into relationships with other
[01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:59.630]  other cannabinoids that are linkage like drag or if you see another
[01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:04.470]  cannabinoid do you notice that it stops the production of THC V like we know
[01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:08.230]  there's limits of what can be formed within the within the cookbook yeah you
[01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:14.590]  know and and yeah to that to that point is that seeing that they with the THC V
[01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:20.270]  is as well the spikes in THC as well so it's identifying and that those
[01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:25.070]  particular high THC's and then all of a sudden you'll see CBD completely
[01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:30.070]  knocked out alt altogether and that's right now it's being able to put that in
[01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:34.270]  a controlled growing environment because how much do you know this is something
[01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:40.310]  as these environmental conditions at what point is that is that as well being
[01:06:40.310 --> 01:07:07.860]  attributed to to that makeup well as far as CBD goes I know if you can get a
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:12.660]  more fungal dominated soil you're going to get a higher test result is that help
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:15.740]  is that what you're looking for
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:43.500]  I I haven't done that but yeah well I was I was just gonna like just kind of
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.500]  reemphasize what you're saying that it that that does exist you know like
[01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:50.540]  people that taste my weed and I'm not saying this is necessarily a good thing
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:52.980]  but I've been using a lot of the same mixes for a long time and they always
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:58.460]  see you're all your weed tastes as a real similar deal and I think it's a bit
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:03.180]  bit mix like what I'm putting in there input wise it's a bit environment it's a
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:08.740]  bit like my biome that's I guess the part that I wanted to put up you know
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:12.900]  I'm touching the plants I'm touching the soil the guy I learned to grow from he
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:16.540]  taught me how to mix and he's he goes you're sweating good and he goes shake
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:20.620]  that shit off he made me shake my drips off and I think about it every time I'm
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:24.340]  mixing soil that the sweats going in there and that's gonna taste you know
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.980]  somebody it's kind of gross when you think about it but somebody's gonna
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:30.460]  taste that down the road and that it's leaving an impression and you know and
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:36.260]  my what's going on with me is is what's going on with my microbes to my emotions
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:40.660]  my life and I've you know it's a little bit weird whatever I always try to
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:45.020]  approach my gardens with a clear head if I have to stop and smoke a joint take a
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:49.500]  walk I don't always do it but I've always tried to put little signs and
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:55.120]  stuff to remind me like chill out dude be happy I never work angry when I work
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:00.880]  on the plants I think that really does I chill because you you are rough it's
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.600]  like with your kids you deal with your children you need to make sure that you
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.640]  turn down your personal shit with any decision you make with them because
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:14.400]  otherwise you're harsh and that impact on him is tremendous because they're
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.760]  sensitive and I look at plants the same way and I just tell people that's what
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:23.880]  that's why I love cannabis because it slows me down I can't be aggressive I
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:28.720]  can't be hurried or rushed I have to move at the plants pace and I think
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.840]  that that changed the way I perceive life it let me understand a natural
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:37.520]  progression that things can only move at the pace they do and when you try to go
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:43.960]  past that you miss things and you cause problems and so I agree man I turned
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:49.160]  down my my drama when you're when you're monkey brain or whatever they call it
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:55.120]  like everything breaks around you you you know you're just you know and so
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:59.880]  it's like you just causing more problems by being in that space you know so I
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:05.360]  don't know do you have any any testing on that what just minute minute minute
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.880]  it's it's um it's almost putting taking inputs out is something like the last
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:16.720]  couple is health with breeding how far can you push a plant to stress for like
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:20.240]  farming for instance and seen a lot with that all of a sudden you just pull the
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.320]  water off pull the plant off water and have it like it just all of a sudden it
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.400]  does doesn't fill up but the the the flower the way it changes and the
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:34.040]  terpenes within it so it's really taking as much as possible out of the plant as
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:40.480]  far as input and seeing its performance and and because some plants will just
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.000]  they won't they can't handle it they're gone so just move through on to the next
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.600]  and some of these ones that are really vigorous and then you can we've taken
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.520]  these vigorous plants and then put them in a greenhouse that's got you know
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:56.800]  that's got mites that's got bugs that's got p.m. throw it next to these plants
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.240]  how does it perform is it getting these diseases some of them that don't pull
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:04.680]  them back outside and keep working with that how much duress and stress can be
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:08.120]  put on the plant and see good performance and that's like looking at it
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:12.000]  from an athlete point and then when you give it a little input it's kind of
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.760]  bringing it back down and taking everything out of it and then when you
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:19.040]  give it a little you know a couple pellets of you know seabird guano or
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:25.920]  whatever it may be that fertilizer and then you watch that change all right one
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:44.260]  more question strawberry cough yeah that's a deep question for me it would
[01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:48.300]  be something that no one in the cannabis community knows it's just the
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:55.260]  rapture it's an old NL g13 hash plant across from North Carolina the question
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:12:00.580]  was what do you regret losing the most I lost a plant that would have come out of
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:06.620]  like the late 80s out of Bryslin and when you lit it it looked like a burning
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:11.700]  tire and I got so high when I smoked it that I'd lay down on the couch and my
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:14.780]  girl would come in and I'd wake up and she'd be wiping my face with the rag
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:18.980]  asking me if I was sick because I was feverish and I would mumble and I'm just
[01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:26.300]  really high and it had the most complete effect I've ever experienced and it was
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:33.660]  stunning cannabis in every aspect it had a visual quality it had a growth quality
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:42.700]  it had a quality a high that was unreal and it got killed by mistake and I said
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:46.540]  oh we'll go find more like that but I realized quickly that that was a memory
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:52.540]  and that was the one I wish I had back more than anyone it was so green it was
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:57.100]  almost like blue and I used to call it like you know like a blue varietal but
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:01.060]  it literally would make regular people ill they would it would it would fold
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:05.620]  you over and and kick you in the ass and send you home and say come back when
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:11.340]  you're grown up the beauty of cannabis is that all of us have that special
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:14.620]  thing and that's why I've always been trying to explain to people you don't
[01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:17.940]  have to be a big banker but you got a bank a little bit you got to make sure
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:21.900]  you keep some stock you got to make sure you're involved in some breeding don't
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:25.860]  let anybody talk shit to you because you're a pollen chucker you're somebody
[01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:29.300]  who has historically done what we've done since the dawn of time you've
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:34.020]  chosen things to put together for your desire and when people ask me you know
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:38.020]  what should I smoke I'm like I'm not qualified to tell you because I'm not
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:42.540]  you I can put you into things and I can help you understand why you like it but
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:46.060]  fundamentally I'm not you I'm not qualified to tell you what you should
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:52.060]  like it's like telling someone who they should love you're not qualified what
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:55.580]  you know you I know you lost something good man you've had a lot of stuff in
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:14:02.700]  your hand boy oh yeah that's oh my god I lost the one and that's where you come
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:07.460]  in with the sharing and it's like I'd being a being breeding seeds and taking
[01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:11.060]  these times it's like they're your children and it's like that's like the
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:15.340]  one thing it's like spreading that right now and it was like back in the you know
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:21.980]  the early 90s and running into walls and getting losing these certain genetics
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:26.420]  and that's like what was drove me back to go to like Southeast Asia it's like
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:29.220]  finding this you know that was happy pizzas I don't know if you've been to
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:33.100]  Cambodia but you eat this fucking pizza and you're tripping you know you're in
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:38.220]  Cambodia on the and there's this different level to that and this was
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:42.140]  something when you could grow this and it was a nice producer it would grow
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:45.660]  under the man's need as well here and you could put it in a mixed bag of tricks
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:50.620]  and get 5600 a pound for it it had different colors it wasn't that name but
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:54.940]  that's like these are the some old Southeast Asian you know these these
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:15:01.340]  long flowering times but just the soaring psychedelic highs and that
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:07.500]  different feeling and that's part of that backtracking and finding what
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:12.220]  exactly like one of them was CBD it was reaching out to you know with Ringo and
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:16.300]  like Jaime when this was when people were first introducing that you know the
[01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:21.020]  Juanita lagrimosa and that you know that can of tonic of those old genetics
[01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:25.780]  and it's like okay well this was Oaxaca this region Colombia you know where were
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:30.540]  these things coming from and then trying to search those out and that's like when
[01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:34.940]  you mentioned that with Africa what's is getting is we're losing this you know
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:39.220]  these unique ones that are out there and it's being able to find these special
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:43.100]  ones but at what point we you want to share these but you don't want them to
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:46.820]  go into the wrong hands and that's something we're gonna be facing right
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:52.620]  now being breeders I think coming more and more as we've got the bigger players
[01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:57.620]  that are coming in and are just they don't realize the time and the energy
[01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:02.220]  that's put into these certain cultivars and how rare and special they are and
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:08.220]  that that's something that we have to protect true true
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:12.460]  anything you lose it you wish I the strawberry cough I lost that I had right
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:16.980]  away and I thought about it a lot like I've popped some beans and I haven't
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:22.100]  found anything that was it was that I'm pretty sure it was the strawberry cough
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:25.780]  because I've seen the cough and it had that you know that's very distinguished
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:31.180]  like real thick smoke you know but it was the first plant that we ever I
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:36.100]  remember here did two plants under two lights and we got six pounds and we were
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:41.140]  it was like blown away the first time that ever happened and it was very easy
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:45.260]  to trim just these little golf ball nugs which most the cough is not in the
[01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:48.620]  strawberry cup it's is bigger you know denser fluffier but it was was really
[01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:53.940]  anyways and it was it was really because I was medicine for me I came into
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:58.900]  cannabis from a bicycle accident and so I was fucked up I got hit by a car I was
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:02.980]  fucked up really hard for a couple years and just like learning to grow weed
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:06.060]  walking around the house smoking as much weed as I could and it was that
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:11.900]  strawberry cough that like really was able to help me manage so I did was a
[01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:15.820]  damn shark's breath that I lost it too I got stuck with the shark threat cutting
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:19.740]  and I hated that thing and as I took a cut I thought it was a strawberry I
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:22.540]  messed it up and it was a shark's breath and I could never get rid of that
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:30.740]  fucking plant all right man hey I just want to say thanks for taking time to
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:35.300]  spend the day with us and it's a privilege to have you all as an audience
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:40.140]  and I would love to have you give a hand to the individuals that put this
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:52.680]  together and give a salute to yourself too man because really you all we worked
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:56.940]  hard to get here you worked hard the fact that you're still here doing your
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:18:00.160]  thing means that you didn't give up during a lot of hard times and you
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:05.240]  didn't give up under the oppression that's occurring and that's a testament
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:09.600]  to willpower and resiliency and I salute you for that so thank you very
