[01:00.540 --> 01:07.540]  You're coming through this dark canal and there's light and you cannot miss that light.
[01:07.540 --> 01:12.540]  And that's where we're at. We're in the vagina of the cannabis movement.
[01:12.540 --> 01:43.960]  And this community.
[01:44.960 --> 01:48.960]  Look, we already got a technical error.
[01:48.960 --> 01:51.960]  Hey, everybody. I'm Melania Dubois.
[01:51.960 --> 01:57.960]  And as you can see, I've got some amazing people on the screen with me right now.
[01:57.960 --> 02:00.960]  We've got Adelia Carrillo of Event High,
[02:00.960 --> 02:05.960]  Kat Ng of the Ethica Data Alliance,
[02:05.960 --> 02:09.960]  and Michael Beck of Royal Grown Radio and Royal Gold.
[02:09.960 --> 02:14.960]  What are we doing here on your Facebook live feed on a Sunday?
[02:14.960 --> 02:24.960]  Well, we're here to raise money for folks in the Emerald Triangle who are heavily impacted by the devastating fires of 2021.
[02:24.960 --> 02:32.960]  We all live in a re or Michael and I and a lot of our guests live in a region called the Emerald Triangle.
[02:32.960 --> 02:35.960]  And the Emerald Triangle has been curating cannabis.
[02:35.960 --> 02:39.960]  I actually know a family for six generations.
[02:39.960 --> 02:48.960]  We protected this plant for many years and really have built the foundation around it and what we're now building off of for this industry.
[02:48.960 --> 02:55.960]  And right now, those communities are being impacted through many things.
[02:55.960 --> 03:02.960]  Climate change being one of them. This fire ravaged these communities for over four months.
[03:02.960 --> 03:08.960]  And then they're also dealing with heavy changes in legalization and taxation.
[03:08.960 --> 03:12.960]  That's not allowing them to get through the permit process fully.
[03:12.960 --> 03:26.960]  We have one county that will that had over 450 farms wanting to become legal right now has only six farms because they're unable to afford or get through the processes.
[03:27.960 --> 03:44.960]  So today we're here to raise funds not only for those farms, but for all landowners, small business owners and local organizations to help help them rebuild and keep going to sustain our beautiful culture here in the Emerald Triangle.
[03:44.960 --> 03:50.960]  And thank you all of you watching and getting ready to participate for joining us.
[03:50.960 --> 04:00.960]  Adelia, welcome, Michael, Kat. So Kat, you've been first, thanks for helping on production. Kat and I are going to be behind the scenes doing production.
[04:00.960 --> 04:05.960]  Adelia and Michael are going to be your hosts with the mostest today.
[04:05.960 --> 04:09.960]  And then you're going to get to see some amazing guests.
[04:09.960 --> 04:16.960]  We have Kieko here from Coral Cove Wellness. She's going to share what global community means.
[04:16.960 --> 04:30.960]  We have Duncan McIntosh, who is a local community leader in Trinity County, and he really brought his community was a part of bringing his community together and rallying face to face against these fires.
[04:30.960 --> 04:36.960]  We've got OGs coming on. We've got breeders coming on. We've got mad scientists coming on.
[04:36.960 --> 04:42.960]  We've got we're going to teach you how technologies can save the day for these legacies.
[04:42.960 --> 04:49.960]  We're going to show you us, all sorts of us. Some of my favorite people actually are coming on today.
[04:49.960 --> 05:01.960]  So I'm really excited. Adelia, Michael, anything you want to say to everybody before we dive into our five hour extravaganza of Emerald Triangle Cannabis?
[05:02.960 --> 05:12.960]  I just wanted to say I'm so excited to be a co-host with Michael for this, you know, this amazing community event that Humboldt, Grace and Lele have put together.
[05:12.960 --> 05:22.960]  We as Lele said, we have an amazing lineup of speakers joining us and giving us their Sunday to make this event a huge success in the hopes that we can sell more auction items.
[05:22.960 --> 05:28.960]  So get those wallets out and let's really make an impact today.
[05:28.960 --> 05:42.960]  Wonderful. And I'd like to just echo those sentiments and express my gratitude for Lele and all of these community members for coming together and all of you for watching everyone who comes in after everyone who takes a minute to bid on an item.
[05:42.960 --> 05:56.960]  Thank you all for supporting our community. It is integrally important for all of our survival and growth to work together and communicate and Humboldt, Grace and the Humboldt, Grace Fire Recovery Project have been that conduit, that connection,
[05:56.960 --> 06:04.960]  and are helping to bring us all into the future where we're supporting each other and surviving and thriving in the new world of cannabis legislation.
[06:04.960 --> 06:06.960]  Thanks, Michael.
[06:06.960 --> 06:22.960]  Okay, well, I just want to say that, you know, and I've said this amongst our group before, I'm a longtime cannabis user, and for the privilege I've always enjoyed, it's, I feel honored to be able to support the farmers that have allowed me to do that for most of my life.
[06:23.960 --> 06:39.960]  Thanks, you guys. It's an honor and it's exciting to have, you know, local and global here really showing these farmers that they have support, you know, that it's a tough time right now, but a lot of people are here to support.
[06:40.960 --> 06:58.960]  So we're going to start off the show with someone I grew up with. I've known Duncan his whole life. I'm a little older than him, but I really appreciate hearing Duncan speak because he loves community as much as I do. And we're going to start with a little clip that shows one of his moments in the actual fire.
[07:03.830 --> 07:04.830]  It is roaring up there.
[07:06.830 --> 07:07.830]  It's actually settled down quite a bit.
[07:10.830 --> 07:11.830]  Wind is at my back.
[07:13.830 --> 07:15.830]  Red Hill is ablaze.
[07:19.930 --> 07:20.930]  Holy shit.
[07:31.010 --> 07:34.010]  Hello, Duncan. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us.
[07:35.010 --> 07:54.010]  Yeah, it's my pleasure. Thank you so much for providing this platform. Fire, cannabis, community are all factors in my life that I hold dear. So, yeah. Thank you for having us.
[07:55.010 --> 08:22.010]  No problem. For those of you who don't know Duncan, and this is our first time meeting, so this is a pleasure for me, but he is a member of the North Fork Grange community facilitator. He's part of the Trinity County Planning Commission and does just a tremendous amount of connection and contribution to this entire community, long time cultivator and someone who's been involved deeply in Northern California, Trinity County, Emerald County legislation.
[08:23.010 --> 08:30.010]  And communication. So thank you, Duncan. I'm really excited to kind of chat through some of your contributions and what this project means to you.
[08:34.560 --> 08:41.560]  So tell us a little bit about your involvement here and why it means so much to you.
[08:42.560 --> 09:08.560]  Oh man, where to start. Well, first of all, along with Lele, I grew up in these mountains. My family have been up in these mountains for, well, my children would be sixth generation. We've been farmers, loggers, teachers, construction workers, and we've had to really be able to adapt to the ever changing boom and bust of this Klamath knot in which we live.
[09:09.560 --> 09:22.560]  And so cannabis has been a vehicle for our community to continue to survive and thrive when the timber industry went away.
[09:23.560 --> 09:40.560]  And that created after Prop 215, that created an opportunity for us to kind of come out of the shadows and be able to have our plants in our front yards and be able to grow the medicine and grow with pride.
[09:41.560 --> 09:57.560]  And there was culture and community that was built through these experiences and this way of life. And so when legalization was on the horizon, we realized that if we're not on the menu, or if we're not at the table, we're going to be on the menu, so to speak.
[09:58.560 --> 10:22.560]  And so we sat there and tried to, attempted to build bridges with so many factions of our community, from the head of the drug task force to the supervisors to environmental organizations, to try to bridge the gap and kind of put a personal face on this medicine, which has had such a bad rap because of the war on drugs.
[10:23.560 --> 10:34.560]  And so that had enabled me to really meet so many different, wonderful people from the farthest reaches of our community, from Denny to High Impalm to Haythwork and beyond.
[10:35.560 --> 10:48.560]  And so that was my involvement on ushering in mindful regulations in our county to support small family farms so that our community and our culture can continue.
[10:49.560 --> 10:54.560]  I also have been involved with our North Fork Grange, which is our community hall in Junction City.
[10:55.560 --> 11:14.560]  And so we have been working to also change the face of the bad stereotypes by finding opportunities for different businesses, including cannabis farms, to collaborate with the Grange, to sponsor events and to help us and to work together so that we can grow and they can grow and we can build together.
[11:15.560 --> 11:21.560]  And so that has been a tremendous community building opportunity and so much fun.
[11:22.560 --> 11:28.560]  And then, geez, fire has been just a part of our lives and always been a part of my life.
[11:29.560 --> 11:46.560]  I grew up burning on my family's property and burning slash, but the wildfires have continued to get more and more into our communities and into our personal space, so to speak.
[11:47.560 --> 11:55.560]  Because, I mean, now we have three months, four months of fire. Now we have five seasons rather than four seasons. We have the season of smoke and fire.
[11:55.560 --> 12:07.560]  But what we found is it has also provided a tremendous opportunity that crisis is due to bring us together so that because we can't really take care of any of this alone.
[12:08.560 --> 12:14.560]  And so the fire has been a tremendous community building exercise, so to speak.
[12:15.560 --> 12:30.560]  I completely agree. It was very humbling to be down on the coast and watching so many family and friends go through these struggles and not having a way to effectively help and contribute as a community from the coast.
[12:30.560 --> 12:36.560]  And, you know, there are calls for action, calls to help. But, you know, that's a dangerous situation to bring people into.
[12:37.560 --> 12:48.560]  And it really requires platforms like this and kind of a side route in to support those communities effectively. So we want to thank you for your involvement there. That's been huge.
[12:49.560 --> 12:55.560]  And I want to say also your contributions to the community. That's a big part of what this entire Humboldt Grace community is about.
[12:56.560 --> 13:05.560]  It's part of what Royal Grown Radio is about is bringing people together and elevating the voices so we can build this community and contribute more cohesively.
[13:06.560 --> 13:13.560]  And so these are these opportunities to get involved and to donate and to get something for your donation. Get into the raffle.
[13:14.560 --> 13:19.560]  So let's give everybody at home a little bit of instruction on how to get involved in this raffle.
[13:20.560 --> 13:24.560]  Head on over to the website, head on over to the auction and check it out.
[13:25.560 --> 13:29.560]  What do you know about the auction in general, Duncan?
[13:30.560 --> 13:36.560]  Because this has been a long time project that we've been all bringing different tiny threads in to weave this tapestry to help the community.
[13:37.560 --> 13:51.560]  Yeah, my understanding of this is communicating with Lele initially and her heart extending out to the community that was suffering and finding a way that she can help.
[13:52.560 --> 13:55.560]  And she felt helpless along with so many other people.
[13:55.560 --> 14:24.560]  And so my understanding is that this auction is far reaching, far and wide, where there is art and tours and different objects that are donated from people's hearts and donated to this platform so that the proceeds can go right back to us farmers and our community to rebuild for our water systems and rebuilding barns and rebuilding our water systems.
[14:25.560 --> 14:34.560]  And so there's one particular item on there that was a sister in Hay Fork whose home almost burned.
[14:35.560 --> 14:49.560]  She was a prior planning commissioner for 12 years that really put her neck out there and was, I'm not going to say she was an activist because she was a planning commissioner, but she really sees the benefit of cannabis in our community.
[14:49.560 --> 14:55.560]  And her name is Diana Stewart and she has donated a quilt that is for the raffle.
[14:56.560 --> 14:57.560]  And it's really, really special.
[14:58.560 --> 15:04.560]  And it is from a pillar founding member of our community with the cannabis legalization.
[15:05.560 --> 15:07.560]  And so that's pretty much my understanding of it.
[15:08.560 --> 15:09.560]  Amazing. Thank you so much.
[15:10.560 --> 15:16.560]  So we'll keep chatting for a second here, but it looks like we've got more amazing guests coming right behind us.
[15:16.560 --> 15:20.560]  We got Keiko Beatty, who's going to be interviewed by Adelia Carrillo.
[15:21.560 --> 15:23.560]  And, you know, we're going to dig into some more subjects here.
[15:24.560 --> 15:26.560]  I hope you stick around, Duncan, and participate on the social medias.
[15:27.560 --> 15:28.560]  Thank you so much.
[15:29.560 --> 15:30.560]  Thank you so much, Michael.
[15:31.560 --> 15:32.560]  Thank you, Lele.
[15:33.560 --> 15:40.560]  And everyone who's tuning in, that quilt that Duncan mentioned, for everyone, we're keeping track of the chat.
[15:41.560 --> 15:45.560]  For everyone who engages in the chat, you'll be entering for a drawing for that quilt.
[15:46.560 --> 15:52.560]  So please participate and tune in and ask questions of our guests.
[15:53.560 --> 15:55.560]  Thanks, Duncan. Be safe. Be well out there.
[15:56.560 --> 15:57.560]  Thank you.
[15:58.560 --> 16:02.560]  All right. So Adelia's next, Michael. Is that what we've got up on the screen?
[16:03.560 --> 16:04.560]  That's what I see.
[16:05.560 --> 16:06.560]  All right.
[16:07.560 --> 16:08.560]  Hello.
[16:09.560 --> 16:11.560]  All the KCO staff ladies, hello.
[16:12.560 --> 16:15.560]  Welcome, Keiko. Thank you for joining us.
[16:16.560 --> 16:17.560]  Thank you for being here.
[16:18.560 --> 16:23.560]  You know, Keiko is a huge supporter of the community and has worked on so many amazing projects in cannabis.
[16:24.560 --> 16:29.560]  Keiko, can you share a bit more about your latest recent projects and a little bit about you?
[16:30.560 --> 16:32.560]  Well, thank you so much, Adelia.
[16:33.560 --> 16:52.560]  It is such a pleasure and honor to be here today to support Humboldt Grace and the wonderful work that Lele has started the community in giving back and being able to help everybody who's gone through the transitions of the fire season.
[16:53.560 --> 17:00.560]  For myself, I've been within the industry and community since the 70s.
[17:01.560 --> 17:07.560]  So I'm a little bit of an OG, you know, more so in Southern California is where I started.
[17:08.560 --> 17:14.560]  And I did have a farm in Southern Oregon up until a couple of years ago.
[17:15.560 --> 17:17.560]  And we, of course, went through the fires there.
[17:18.560 --> 17:27.560]  But being from a family of farmers, my parents were farmers, my grandparents were farmers.
[17:28.560 --> 17:31.560]  And now my son is definitely a cultivator farmer.
[17:33.560 --> 17:44.560]  Knowing what that's like and knowing how they had to go through this fire and the effect that it had on the community and personally as well.
[17:44.560 --> 17:48.560]  I really wanted to be there when I found out what Lele was doing.
[17:49.560 --> 18:04.560]  So thank you so much to everybody here who has joined in to bring all our efforts together to support everybody who needs our extra special help that's gone through the fire.
[18:05.560 --> 18:15.560]  And also to everyone in the technical department, Cat, Adelia, and Michael and everyone that's about to come up and speak too.
[18:16.560 --> 18:19.560]  We really couldn't have done this without Lele for starting it out.
[18:20.560 --> 18:23.560]  And I would say, you know, you asked me who I am and my background.
[18:24.560 --> 18:29.560]  I am on a few different organization boards.
[18:29.560 --> 18:40.560]  Normal. I've been a part of in Orange County for a number of years, as well as the Cannabis Chamber of Commerce and the Asian Cannabis Roundtable.
[18:41.560 --> 18:48.560]  And I also work with some nonprofits that I support over the years, a lot of the veteran groups.
[18:49.560 --> 18:55.560]  So it's I feel that it's my place in the community to give back.
[18:56.560 --> 18:59.560]  Because I know one thing about cultivators.
[19:00.560 --> 19:07.560]  None of us would be here if it wasn't for the effort, then the kindness and the insight of cultivators.
[19:08.560 --> 19:10.560]  We couldn't really do this without them.
[19:11.560 --> 19:20.560]  And it's because of them is why we're here, that we connected with this amazing, this plant that's in our life.
[19:20.560 --> 19:32.560]  That I know that so many of us benefit from for our mental and well-being, our spiritual being, as well as our physical being.
[19:33.560 --> 19:36.560]  And that's what cannabis can do for us.
[19:37.560 --> 19:42.560]  So I'm definitely I do feel I am an activist, first of all.
[19:43.560 --> 19:46.560]  And I'm there definitely for the patients.
[19:47.560 --> 19:50.560]  So my background is Iron-Aiding Chinese holistic medicine.
[19:51.560 --> 19:54.560]  And I've worn many hats through the years, cannabis.
[19:55.560 --> 20:00.560]  And I would say one of my cherished ones is what I'm doing now.
[20:01.560 --> 20:09.560]  I'm the director of education for Coral Cove Wellness, which is one of the first of its kind cannabis and fungi resorts.
[20:10.560 --> 20:12.560]  And that is located in Jamaica.
[20:12.560 --> 20:14.560]  And I want you to come down, Adelia.
[20:15.560 --> 20:16.560]  When are you and Elvie coming?
[20:17.560 --> 20:18.560]  I know, we always talk about it.
[20:19.560 --> 20:20.560]  We got to make it happen.
[20:21.560 --> 20:23.560]  Now that things are opening up, I got my passport.
[20:24.560 --> 20:25.560]  That's the first step.
[20:26.560 --> 20:27.560]  I'm ready to come.
[20:28.560 --> 20:29.560]  Well, we have to work out something for you.
[20:30.560 --> 20:34.560]  But when I saw what Lele was doing, I just reached out to her and I said, I want to help.
[20:35.560 --> 20:36.560]  I want to give my support.
[20:37.560 --> 20:45.560]  And if a stay at Coral Cove will entice somebody to donate and join in, it would be my honor and pleasure.
[20:46.560 --> 20:55.560]  And Coral Cove offers many great amenities, yoga, meditation, as well as we're right on the ocean.
[20:56.560 --> 20:57.560]  There are beautiful Caribbean waters.
[20:58.560 --> 21:03.560]  So there's surfing, kayaking, snorkeling, spearfishing, great food.
[21:03.560 --> 21:05.560]  We have our own dispensary, Adelia.
[21:06.560 --> 21:13.560]  So you can be there under a palapa and then order an eight and they'll bring it to you.
[21:14.560 --> 21:18.560]  And you can just roll something up and take a kayak and puff and paddle away.
[21:19.560 --> 21:23.560]  Well, to kind of go into that a little more, though, you actually donate.
[21:24.560 --> 21:27.560]  You said you donated a gift from Coral Cove.
[21:28.560 --> 21:29.560]  Can you share more about that?
[21:30.560 --> 21:31.560]  Because that is on the auction item.
[21:31.560 --> 21:32.560]  People can make bids right now.
[21:33.560 --> 21:34.560]  Yes.
[21:35.560 --> 21:39.560]  I donated for two people because we can have you go by yourself.
[21:40.560 --> 21:43.560]  This is a trip for four days, three nights.
[21:44.560 --> 21:45.560]  It includes breakfast.
[21:46.560 --> 21:52.560]  And I also included a little gift certificate to the dispensary just to get you started off.
[21:53.560 --> 21:59.560]  You would fly into Montego Bay and we do have a special ground transportation.
[21:59.560 --> 22:03.560]  It takes about 90 minutes to get there from the airport.
[22:04.560 --> 22:09.560]  And once you arrive there, you'll have this Shangri-La available to you.
[22:10.560 --> 22:14.560]  So there's many other things you can do there at Coral Cove.
[22:15.560 --> 22:19.560]  And we do offer education in fungi medicine as well.
[22:20.560 --> 22:25.560]  And we have a shaman who has been doing fungi ceremony for over 30 years.
[22:26.560 --> 22:42.560]  So there you are on the ocean, hopefully enjoying wonderful cannabis and in a relaxing place where the water temperature is on average maybe 70 degrees and the air temperature is about 80 degrees.
[22:43.560 --> 22:51.560]  And most of the rooms, you'll hear the ocean sing you a lullaby at night with the waves upon the shoreline.
[22:52.560 --> 22:53.560]  True, true right there.
[22:54.560 --> 22:56.560]  I see you and Ali there, Adelia.
[22:57.560 --> 22:58.560]  Yes, absolutely.
[22:59.560 --> 23:05.560]  Well, one more question I want to touch in on is, as I mentioned, you are a big community supporter.
[23:06.560 --> 23:07.560]  You are a part of a lot of communities.
[23:08.560 --> 23:12.560]  But what is the importance of building a global community around cannabis?
[23:13.560 --> 23:18.560]  Cannabis has been part of our world for thousands of years.
[23:19.560 --> 23:28.560]  And now that it's becoming much more legal worldwide, that's what's really going to bring us together.
[23:29.560 --> 23:33.560]  The understanding of what they have to offer in other countries.
[23:34.560 --> 23:42.560]  And for Coral Cove, we are looking at other properties besides Jamaica to spread this educational program.
[23:43.560 --> 23:54.560]  And what I feel globally, what's happening for us, I'm with a company where we're cultivating in Jamaica, but we're shipping internationally.
[23:55.560 --> 24:08.560]  So we've shipped to Switzerland, Germany, Portugal, Australia, and here in our own country of the United States, we can't even ship from California to New York.
[24:09.560 --> 24:11.560]  Which is unfortunate.
[24:12.560 --> 24:25.560]  But what I feel is that globally, the world is starting to come together in respect to this plant, that it is a medicine that has been benefiting people for thousands of years.
[24:26.560 --> 24:36.560]  And I think that if we are reaching out and understanding the great research in Israel and the wonderful commerce that's being developed now in Europe.
[24:37.560 --> 24:47.560]  And all throughout the world, more and more companies are coming together to build their international stake in cannabis.
[24:48.560 --> 24:51.560]  But more so, the community is coming together.
[24:52.560 --> 25:02.560]  That just people, parents are learning how to take care of their children and seniors are learning how to benefit themselves from their anxiety and their sleeplessness.
[25:03.560 --> 25:07.560]  And it's all because we're reaching out as a global community.
[25:08.560 --> 25:14.560]  And now there is global tourism coming about too, which is very exciting for cannabis.
[25:15.560 --> 25:17.560]  So much more is being opened and being developed.
[25:18.560 --> 25:20.560]  And I really want to be there.
[25:21.560 --> 25:27.560]  And that's why it will be a mission of mine to make sure that I get a Dahlia and I'll be able to grow.
[25:27.560 --> 25:34.560]  Yes. And then whoever auctions that special item for that bid for the Coral Cove Wellness Package.
[25:35.560 --> 25:37.560]  It's a four day vacation, you said for two people.
[25:38.560 --> 25:42.560]  And then for those that are just tuning in, Coral Cove Wellness is in Jamaica.
[25:43.560 --> 25:46.560]  And you can bid on that auction on the Humboldt Grace website.
[25:47.560 --> 25:48.560]  It's a great deal.
[25:49.560 --> 25:50.560]  You just get so much.
[25:51.560 --> 25:55.560]  Yes. Look at the site there for Humboldt Grace.
[25:55.560 --> 25:59.560]  Get your bids out there because I want to see you there.
[26:00.560 --> 26:02.560]  We also have spa treatments, massages.
[26:03.560 --> 26:06.560]  We have a brand new swimming pool and it's right on the ocean.
[26:07.560 --> 26:16.560]  So if you love to be out in the warm sun and having a great cannabis, you've got to come to Coral Cove.
[26:17.560 --> 26:19.560]  Well, thank you so much for that, Keiko.
[26:20.560 --> 26:22.560]  We appreciate that auction item.
[26:23.560 --> 26:24.560]  Right, Lele? We need to all get over there.
[26:25.560 --> 26:26.560]  I know me and I'll be here for a while.
[26:27.560 --> 26:28.560]  Yes, Lele needs to come too.
[26:29.560 --> 26:33.560]  I think I can share some pictures. I think I just figured that out.
[26:34.560 --> 26:37.560]  Let's see because Keiko sent me some pictures.
[26:38.560 --> 26:41.560]  I can tell you what they are if you can get them up on the screen.
[26:42.560 --> 26:45.560]  Oh, I can. I can. And here we are.
[26:47.560 --> 26:50.560]  Oh, OK. That's a sunset cottage there.
[26:50.560 --> 26:54.560]  We have some separate cottages and we have villas.
[26:55.560 --> 26:58.560]  Oh, wow. Let me. I have more. Hold on.
[26:59.560 --> 27:01.560]  Oh, yeah. Now that that is.
[27:02.560 --> 27:04.560]  No. Where is that? There we go.
[27:05.560 --> 27:07.560]  OK, that's the beach there.
[27:10.560 --> 27:12.560]  And it shows some of our amazing sunset.
[27:13.560 --> 27:19.560]  Now, this view is from Starlight and that's at the top of Turtle Villa.
[27:20.560 --> 27:22.560]  So that's a great view there.
[27:23.560 --> 27:30.560]  And Starlight and Starbrite are some of our finest rooms that give you amazing sunsets, sunrises.
[27:31.560 --> 27:33.560]  That's the interior of one of the rooms.
[27:34.560 --> 27:42.560]  And right now it's only 3.50. It is on the rise, but it's 3.50 for a day vacation in Jamaica at Coral Cove.
[27:43.560 --> 27:44.560]  Come on, everyone.
[27:45.560 --> 27:46.560]  Get your bids in, everyone.
[27:46.560 --> 27:52.560]  This is going to help put good plants, good people back in the ground this year.
[27:53.560 --> 27:54.560]  Let's let's.
[27:55.560 --> 27:58.560]  It's a little vacation, a little honeymoon.
[27:59.560 --> 28:00.560]  Ah, yeah.
[28:02.560 --> 28:05.560]  Well, thank you again, Keiko. We enjoy always speaking with you.
[28:06.560 --> 28:07.560]  I will be in touch personally.
[28:08.560 --> 28:13.560]  And, you know, I can't wait to see who the lucky guests are who will be taking advantage of this auction item.
[28:13.560 --> 28:17.560]  Really hoping you have a wonderful day today. Now, come on, everyone.
[28:18.560 --> 28:24.560]  Get out there. Get some bids because I've known I've been on some items and I hope I'm a winner.
[28:26.560 --> 28:28.560]  All right. Thank you, ladies.
[28:30.560 --> 28:39.300]  Whoops.
[28:40.300 --> 28:52.190]  All right. Well, I don't see Patricia.
[28:53.190 --> 28:55.190]  Is she on the queue, Kat? Do you?
[28:56.190 --> 28:57.190]  I don't see her.
[28:57.190 --> 29:03.190]  I don't see her. But I thought while we were on here, Adelia, maybe what we could do is show some more items.
[29:04.190 --> 29:07.190]  Yeah, let's do that. Let's talk about some more items.
[29:08.190 --> 29:11.190]  Can you see them when I share the screen?
[29:12.190 --> 29:14.190]  Let me check it out. Let's see.
[29:16.190 --> 29:20.190]  Yep. That looks like the Coral Cove one. So we're on that one.
[29:23.190 --> 29:24.190]  And it's now 400.
[29:24.190 --> 29:30.190]  We've got some tools from Pearsons. Pearsons is a local building supply in Humboldt County.
[29:31.190 --> 29:35.190]  Oh, nice. We're at 125 for those tools. Great.
[29:36.190 --> 29:43.190]  This is a nice little kit with some earrings and a bracelet from a local gift store.
[29:43.190 --> 29:53.190]  That folks can bid on. A beautiful picture of a fire by one of our, he is an amazing activist for the environment, Dave Farrell.
[29:54.190 --> 29:59.190]  These will be done on metal frames, so they'll have a lot of depth to them.
[30:00.190 --> 30:04.190]  Wow. We got Patricia back. Patricia is here.
[30:05.190 --> 30:06.190]  Yeah.
[30:06.190 --> 30:19.190]  Well, one comment. So as everyone's looking at what Lele's showing, you all can go to HumboldtGrace.org and in the menu, to make it easier for everyone, it will state it on the menu.
[30:20.190 --> 30:27.190]  You can click on fire recovery auction, and that will show you all the auction items that you can start bidding on.
[30:28.190 --> 30:34.190]  So to make it easier, go to HumboldtGrace.org and then click on fire recovery auction.
[30:35.190 --> 30:40.190]  Well, Patricia, thank you for being here and welcome.
[30:41.190 --> 30:48.190]  So I am honored that you're joining us today. Can you please share with our viewers that may not know you a little bit about yourself?
[30:49.190 --> 30:53.190]  Well, I'm a firefighter. I'm a firefighter. I'm a firefighter.
[30:54.190 --> 31:04.190]  Well, my name is Patricia A. Patton. At home, they call me Ann, my brothers and sisters, but in the digital sphere, I'm known as Canna Boomer.
[31:04.190 --> 31:06.190]  I'm known as can of boomer and
[31:07.610 --> 31:13.810]  So you'll find me on my podcast me and Mary Jane or writing about
[31:16.850 --> 31:18.850]  Specifically writing about
[31:19.550 --> 31:25.650]  Disparities in health and how plant medicine cannabis and hemp can help you as you age
[31:26.390 --> 31:30.530]  that's been my focus in terms of educating myself and
[31:30.530 --> 31:37.450]  Last year during the pandemic. I actually found it the cannabis business alliance, you know, so
[31:37.970 --> 31:45.550]  Yeah, and you know with the one thing I love about your mission with the cannabis business alliance is you state that you believe?
[31:45.550 --> 31:50.090]  There are plenty of opportunities for ancillary businesses to support plant touching
[31:50.690 --> 31:57.210]  Cannabis businesses. Can you share a little bit more like tips or suggestions on that and and why that is important to you?
[31:58.050 --> 31:59.370]  well
[31:59.370 --> 32:05.210]  It's an emerging emerging industry. So for someone like me who is older
[32:05.930 --> 32:07.930]  Who has had a traditional?
[32:08.690 --> 32:11.490]  work life to be perfectly honest it was
[32:12.370 --> 32:19.570]  Important for me as I age to find a place to bring my skills in a creative way
[32:20.370 --> 32:26.330]  To an emerging industry. That's also important as a service to humanity
[32:26.610 --> 32:33.490]  Generally speaking and so one of my skills is the ability to translate difficult information and
[32:34.050 --> 32:41.010]  I feel that inside the cannabis space a lot of us are only talking to other people in the choir
[32:41.490 --> 32:44.890]  So I am very much interested in
[32:45.410 --> 32:53.290]  Getting that information down to people who are community leaders because as we learned during kovat, you know a lot of what?
[32:53.810 --> 32:58.890]  Needs to reach the masses depends upon who the messenger is, you know, so
[33:00.850 --> 33:03.450]  Now why why is you know building
[33:04.050 --> 33:10.370]  Community around this important to you and and is there a community that you're I know you stated that you're kind of you know
[33:10.370 --> 33:16.570]  You're you're more known as with the can of boomer. But are you building a community around that as well for others? I
[33:17.610 --> 33:20.850]  Definitely am working on that. It's very difficult to do that in
[33:20.850 --> 33:26.850]  The challenge has been finding a platform that will distribute this conversation
[33:26.850 --> 33:33.170]  That is not necessarily a cannabis platform because in order to reach a broader audience
[33:33.170 --> 33:37.130]  You know, we need other platforms. We need to really
[33:37.930 --> 33:43.250]  Get somewhere where there is an intersection of health and wellness, you know
[33:43.250 --> 33:48.290]  So that people who are interested can of boomers in particular about
[33:48.810 --> 33:52.210]  Not just enjoyment, but addressing
[33:52.930 --> 33:58.970]  Physical problems have a way to talk about that in an open way rather than quote-unquote
[33:59.490 --> 34:01.490]  Asking for a friend
[34:02.450 --> 34:04.450]  Well, you know this one
[34:04.610 --> 34:09.370]  One question that I just have more personal is you know, I've already had that talk with my parents
[34:09.370 --> 34:15.090]  They are you know, they they're around cannabis. But what about those that you know are tuning in?
[34:15.090 --> 34:20.210]  And they are curious of how can they maybe have this conversation with with their parents or
[34:20.850 --> 34:25.970]  Grandparents on the benefits of cannabis. Do you have any tips to just starting that conversation?
[34:27.610 --> 34:30.730]  Yes, the biggest tip is don't
[34:31.770 --> 34:34.770]  Use your own experience as
[34:35.650 --> 34:37.130]  the
[34:37.130 --> 34:40.250]  model for how they should go about it, I
[34:40.490 --> 34:45.130]  Think that one of the things that I experienced personally when I first entered the
[34:45.770 --> 34:50.970]  Industry about four years ago was I felt some trepidation about
[34:51.810 --> 34:54.610]  Being with people who are my son's age
[34:55.250 --> 34:58.210]  Primarily those were the people who were in the industry
[34:58.850 --> 35:02.650]  Not because of my age, but because I felt pressure about
[35:04.210 --> 35:05.570]  You know
[35:05.570 --> 35:09.010]  Hitting a ball and I was like, okay, I'm gonna hit a ball
[35:09.290 --> 35:16.370]  Hitting a ball. I don't hit balls. So I just socially was a little bit awkward on a bus
[35:17.330 --> 35:22.130]  Being transported to an event when I didn't know what was gonna happen
[35:22.130 --> 35:28.090]  I didn't really want to be square at some point. I felt like I was 17 years old all over again
[35:28.090 --> 35:31.530]  so over time I have found my place and I think that
[35:31.650 --> 35:37.290]  Canna boomers or new people regardless of the age should be free to
[35:37.930 --> 35:39.930]  experience the plant in
[35:39.930 --> 35:46.850]  Their own way, you know, I don't think the pressure of you know, one idea of what normalization is
[35:46.850 --> 35:52.970]  I think that because we've come from one end of the spectrum. We're already at another end. So
[35:53.530 --> 35:55.530]  normalization is simply
[35:56.210 --> 36:00.530]  Hitting a blunt. I don't I think that's a narrow definition of normalization
[36:00.530 --> 36:04.450]  and so if we in the industry open that up a little bit
[36:04.450 --> 36:10.090]  I think there'll be more space for other people to feel comfortable joining in conversations where maybe
[36:10.610 --> 36:14.530]  Exactly what's happening in someone else's life is not happening in theirs
[36:15.690 --> 36:19.690]  Now you bring up some great points and I think you know now as things are progressing
[36:19.690 --> 36:26.370]  We are starting to see you know, even more unique events around that you can find different events or workshops or educational
[36:27.210 --> 36:29.210]  experiences that can cater to
[36:29.210 --> 36:34.370]  Experiences that can cater to and it does not an age, you know, it doesn't have to be an age specification
[36:34.370 --> 36:39.930]  I said not a more activity based it could be more something that brings you in to attract you
[36:39.930 --> 36:45.930]  It doesn't have to be a sesh or a festival. There are so many ways that they can still you know, get that connection, right?
[36:46.730 --> 36:48.730]  Absolutely. Absolutely
[36:49.410 --> 36:55.650]  Well, you know today we're here coming together for our brothers and sisters and Humboldt who were impacted by the fires
[36:56.570 --> 37:04.210]  That just did destroy so many homes and businesses so from your perspective why is it important that we come together nationally for this
[37:05.450 --> 37:07.170]  well, I think
[37:07.170 --> 37:09.170]  the primary idea
[37:09.570 --> 37:14.890]  Behind my having founded the canvas business alliance was really to increase
[37:15.330 --> 37:19.130]  Pathways to participation for people who wanted to be in the industry
[37:19.130 --> 37:24.570]  and so I think that a national conversation about
[37:25.250 --> 37:28.530]  Community building the importance of collaborative
[37:29.290 --> 37:36.170]  Participation the you know, it cost me nothing to amplify the message of humble grace
[37:36.170 --> 37:41.450]  You know if I can spread that message to a larger audience
[37:41.930 --> 37:48.370]  Who will help the farmers there? I mean this is what life is really about
[37:48.370 --> 37:50.970]  You know, this is what the plant is about
[37:50.970 --> 37:54.450]  This is what the plan used to be about when I was a teenager. It really was
[37:55.370 --> 37:59.450]  Passed so I think that this is something
[38:00.410 --> 38:03.290]  We all should be buying into I think that
[38:04.610 --> 38:05.970]  partnerships
[38:05.970 --> 38:07.970]  shared knowledge
[38:08.050 --> 38:10.050]  amplification of
[38:10.530 --> 38:13.810]  Experiences this is how we can change the world and help each other
[38:15.490 --> 38:17.090]  Such good advice
[38:17.090 --> 38:23.250]  You know and I did look at your website but previously before before reconnecting with you through this event
[38:23.530 --> 38:30.490]  But I also touched back back in with your website and there is so much great information that you're sharing for anyone really
[38:31.410 --> 38:34.650]  but if anybody's interested, it's Patricia a
[38:35.730 --> 38:43.210]  Patton calm to check it out for more content and educational content and even learn a little bit more about you
[38:43.410 --> 38:44.770]  correct
[38:45.730 --> 38:52.810]  Yeah, any final words you would like to share with those tuning in yes, I would like to invite any
[38:54.010 --> 38:59.370]  solopreneurs or small business owners who are interested in joining a
[39:00.770 --> 39:02.170]  community of
[39:02.170 --> 39:04.170]  business holders in the
[39:04.530 --> 39:11.450]  Ancillary business owners in the cannabis supply chain to come and join us at cannabis business alliances calm
[39:11.490 --> 39:17.090]  We're launching this week and we'd love to be in community with you
[39:18.650 --> 39:26.410]  Love that and just final words. Did you do you have your eyes on any specific item on the auction today? Listen, I'm an old
[39:27.130 --> 39:32.090]  Tourism professional I worked for the Belgian government in New York City for almost 20 years
[39:32.890 --> 39:37.930]  300 $400 to go to Jamaica for four days. Like this is a steal
[39:38.250 --> 39:40.630]  You know, you guys gotta get on it
[39:42.450 --> 39:44.450]  Yes, yes we do
[39:45.210 --> 39:51.490]  Well, thank you again Patricia. We enjoyed having you here and we appreciate your time and support. Thank you so much
[39:51.690 --> 39:54.530]  Thank you, Patricia. My pleasure. Layla
[39:56.450 --> 40:02.770]  Back to those days and to see where it's come to now where there's all these folks coming in from everywhere
[40:03.410 --> 40:10.010]  Popping up greenies and establishing their businesses and you know choosing the strains and getting them out there and making them popular
[40:10.010 --> 40:14.410]  It's like on some level. I feel like it's kind of gotten out of our hands that way for sure
[40:14.690 --> 40:19.690]  It'll never take away from the history here because you can't right but I mean
[40:20.210 --> 40:26.930]  Corporate America is doing its best to hone in on us, you know and and the money that's involved with it, right?
[40:26.930 --> 40:32.090]  And but that's where our culture is that right now is they're not they haven't dealt with a culture like us in the fight that
[40:32.090 --> 40:34.490]  We've had to do and it's like when we moved to humble
[40:35.130 --> 40:36.570]  We weren't born here
[40:36.570 --> 40:38.130]  but we chose to like
[40:38.130 --> 40:41.970]  Stick a flag up and tell them to fuck off and we'll fight camp and grow weed in
[40:42.050 --> 40:46.930]  On the hillside in the Matoa Valley or wherever the fuck we want. Like you said, you know, they would come every day
[40:47.970 --> 40:54.530]  Helicopters and they would stop at four o'clock or five o'clock and go home. Yeah, and then they'd come back to the exact same spot
[40:57.090 --> 40:59.370]  All right, well that was an interview
[41:00.170 --> 41:05.690]  By Michael on Royal grown radio with one of our upcoming guests Rob go lightly
[41:05.690 --> 41:10.490]  Who's also a part of this humble grace community? Well, that was great
[41:12.050 --> 41:16.010]  Where I lost Adelia there's Mike. All right, someone's helping out here
[41:16.010 --> 41:23.330]  I want to pop us back in real quick before we move on to Mike. Do we have Adam and and Cara on yet?
[41:23.530 --> 41:28.330]  Well, it looks like we're just a minute behind Adam is getting into the chat room
[41:28.330 --> 41:30.490]  But we're really excited to have this conversation
[41:30.490 --> 41:36.010]  This is one of the most exciting parts of the day because it's new to me to speak with Cara Cordoni
[41:37.130 --> 41:39.130]  of
[41:39.170 --> 41:42.290]  You know, she's CEO of Minerva minded
[41:44.130 --> 41:46.130]  Director and cast member of
[41:46.410 --> 41:48.410]  Director and cast member of
[41:48.770 --> 41:55.170]  trim women in cannabis and also Adam Ross director of trim and women women in cannabis
[41:55.170 --> 42:03.450]  so I'm really excited to dig into what their contributions are their their perspective on exactly what we're dealing with today and how we
[42:03.450 --> 42:07.970]  can raise awareness as a community grow the community strengthen each other and
[42:08.610 --> 42:14.330]  Ultimately today get people onto this humble grace fire project auction get in there make those bids
[42:15.050 --> 42:20.050]  Support this community in every way you can and then you know after this we come together and
[42:20.850 --> 42:24.370]  Continue to build this community and find new ways to contribute and grow together
[42:25.170 --> 42:28.970]  So I want us to show I want to show a quick clip. We've got more clips
[42:28.970 --> 42:33.090]  We'll show throughout the day but of the movie that we're talking about
[42:33.210 --> 42:40.690]  We are going to be also hosting a live first time screening of that movie this spring here in Humboldt County
[42:41.050 --> 42:46.130]  But while we're getting Adam and Cara on let's show the folks a little bit about what we're talking about
[42:48.250 --> 42:51.770]  A midwife in this community for 40 years
[42:52.530 --> 42:57.610]  Vagina is after the uterus just you're coming through this dark
[42:57.730 --> 43:05.890]  Canal and there's light and you cannot miss that light and that's where we're in the vagina of the cannabis
[43:10.690 --> 43:12.690]  I
[43:36.830 --> 43:39.710]  Was fantastic I really enjoyed that soundtrack
[43:41.430 --> 43:45.590]  Welcome Cara, I'm very excited to introduce you Cara Cordova and
[43:46.830 --> 43:52.110]  Adam Ross, thank you both for being here huge contributors to the community. I appreciate it
[43:53.310 --> 43:58.150]  As somebody who's been out here in Humboldt for over 20 years and in the cannabis industry much longer
[43:58.270 --> 44:05.630]  It was awesome often a very unsung role that women in cannabis played but very very much a part of it, you know
[44:06.670 --> 44:12.790]  especially here in Humboldt a lot of what I saw was men out there doing the hustle out in the mix of things and
[44:13.270 --> 44:18.910]  The women quietly behind the scenes doing just as much or more to support and create a platform
[44:19.550 --> 44:25.310]  To do what they were doing to cultivate the best cannabis and create a community and they were the glue
[44:26.310 --> 44:28.310]  So it's really inspiring
[44:29.030 --> 44:31.030]  to me to see more
[44:31.990 --> 44:38.390]  Celebration and emergence of these women coming forward and higher roles and showing us all
[44:39.950 --> 44:43.270]  How important it is to have that influence in the community
[44:43.270 --> 44:46.830]  So thank you so much for joining us. Tell us a little bit about the project
[44:49.190 --> 44:51.190]  Well in a long time in the making
[44:51.790 --> 44:53.790]  I'm kind of known for
[44:54.710 --> 44:59.070]  Cash crop which was a Netflix hit for about eight years
[45:00.350 --> 45:02.470]  Where we had a fake movie title
[45:03.750 --> 45:05.510]  started filming in
[45:05.510 --> 45:07.510]  2007
[45:07.710 --> 45:09.710]  No two or three years
[45:11.430 --> 45:12.830]  Had to take our
[45:12.830 --> 45:19.630]  Batteries out of our cell phones and things used to come in to a kind of a nautilus journey up
[45:20.190 --> 45:24.510]  Kind of a jewel in Isle or going up river. I called it to the heart of lightness
[45:25.190 --> 45:27.190]  instead of the heart of darkness in
[45:28.710 --> 45:30.430]  Europe really
[45:30.430 --> 45:35.990]  Kind of I have found it moment of the film was the way cash crop was shaped and during that time
[45:35.990 --> 45:42.150]  I had been filming women all along but there was such great risk from CPS and things like that
[45:42.910 --> 45:49.190]  That not only growers letting me in risking their livelihood and exposing the family and their whole situation
[45:49.350 --> 45:54.390]  And there it grows to me, but I couldn't risk putting a lot of women on camera
[45:55.710 --> 46:00.310]  But I continuously filmed from 2007 to the present and I'm still filming
[46:01.790 --> 46:04.310]  What now has amounted to four
[46:05.310 --> 46:08.430]  Called the cannabis Chronicles and the second one
[46:08.950 --> 46:13.990]  Which is in sneak preview and which will also be part of the fire recovery fundraiser
[46:14.990 --> 46:16.790]  through humble grace
[46:16.790 --> 46:18.790]  and also
[46:20.590 --> 46:23.950]  National things it will bring up the profile of home
[46:24.750 --> 46:27.790]  Pacific Lee humble grace, but
[46:28.430 --> 46:35.070]  Yeah, my interest was I saw this thing grow and it became kind of at one point
[46:35.070 --> 46:39.990]  I had one of those stoner hikes where I had that epiphany of oh my god
[46:39.990 --> 46:47.030]  I had the title and maybe it was in recollection of something Russian group pussy riot or something
[46:47.230 --> 46:50.190]  But I just said oh my god
[46:50.710 --> 46:56.350]  All the women started out as trimmers and now at that point in 2017
[46:56.710 --> 47:03.190]  When the United States had American women CEOs were only 2.5%
[47:03.910 --> 47:08.430]  Cannabis had 37% now it's declined since then substantially
[47:08.670 --> 47:12.870]  But still I saw over the years of filming cash crop
[47:13.110 --> 47:17.190]  One of the things I fell in love with I've I've lived abroad many years
[47:17.950 --> 47:22.350]  my background is as a touring musician and all that from the age of 19 and
[47:23.950 --> 47:27.990]  Not particularly nationalistic, but the thing I'm very patriotic about is
[47:28.150 --> 47:33.350]  That you folks up there and in the state of California really now grow the best weed in the world and
[47:33.870 --> 47:36.830]  It's something I'm proud of but not just the weed
[47:37.350 --> 47:40.070]  But as I tell people who see these films
[47:40.990 --> 47:48.790]  Yeah, it's about the weed the people and it's about you all and when through care I met Lele and
[47:49.470 --> 47:52.190]  Connected it was like divine intervention
[47:52.230 --> 47:56.350]  Very much recalled to me when I first met Tim Blake and
[47:56.950 --> 48:04.270]  Having an area 101 debates for the district attorney and county sheriff the way the county the cannabis community
[48:04.910 --> 48:07.990]  We're so solid and I felt had really
[48:09.230 --> 48:13.870]  Ironically this counterculture had American values that we cherish
[48:14.390 --> 48:18.550]  We're found in the American community and we're found in the American community
[48:18.550 --> 48:20.550]  And
[48:20.550 --> 48:26.390]  Myself as I described myself from as you know a humanist environmentalist and
[48:26.910 --> 48:32.030]  Really by default also you have to be a feminist because you can't have the you know one without the other
[48:32.510 --> 48:38.550]  And you know my film started coming from a music background started a soundtrack to a
[48:39.110 --> 48:41.110]  Vietnam based film to
[48:42.110 --> 48:44.110]  after 9-11 seeing of my own
[48:44.110 --> 48:52.430]  Between the bridges which is award-winning film about gentrification and an artist community on the Brooklyn Brooklyn waterfront and
[48:53.470 --> 48:59.550]  Subsequently I filmed the second the Brooklyn series is that a rat Rasmus High School, which is
[49:00.270 --> 49:03.870]  Barbara Streisand and then Clive Davis's high school that
[49:04.710 --> 49:07.230]  Through the crack epidemic is now 90% gang
[49:08.030 --> 49:13.190]  And at the same time I film cash crops I'm flying back and forth with weed on my boots going into high school
[49:14.470 --> 49:16.150]  but
[49:16.150 --> 49:20.510]  Trim has been a joy. It's been filmed from 2017 to the present
[49:21.230 --> 49:22.830]  so
[49:22.830 --> 49:26.950]  I'm a fan of the film and I'm a fan of the story and I'm a fan of the film and
[49:28.350 --> 49:32.670]  I'm a fan of the story and I'm a fan of the film and I'm a fan of the story
[49:32.670 --> 49:36.330]  Joy, it's been filmed from 2017 to the present
[49:36.870 --> 49:41.510]  So it has a lot of any it's a lot of little characters and I jokingly say that
[49:41.910 --> 49:47.790]  Cara pops up often as kind of wears Waldo because I will see her in Oakland
[49:47.790 --> 49:52.350]  I will see her in Denver. I will see her all over the place and
[49:53.070 --> 49:54.870]  Maybe one of the upcoming
[49:54.870 --> 50:00.290]  Teasers you'll show something. It's also portrayed in the film. That's some a great
[50:01.290 --> 50:08.730]  Lyrics she put to a famous kind of rawhide theme. But yeah, that's you know, my background is really a guerrilla filmmaker
[50:09.250 --> 50:10.930]  moving into
[50:10.930 --> 50:12.650]  kind of alternative
[50:12.650 --> 50:15.850]  In those regards. I'm not part of the kind of Hollywood
[50:16.810 --> 50:18.810]  establishment as much but
[50:19.810 --> 50:21.810]  Yeah, it's great to do this
[50:22.210 --> 50:25.770]  For my friends and I have people in Europe watching this now
[50:26.090 --> 50:31.890]  And there's a whole thing going down with Germany's looking with their new Green Party and Social Democratic Party of
[50:32.490 --> 50:38.970]  Legalizing eventually this year. So they want to know what we're all up to and they there's some watching you guys now
[50:39.170 --> 50:41.490]  so this is really
[50:42.330 --> 50:47.210]  We've planted seeds and I'm really like all we up where y'all are this spring
[50:47.810 --> 50:49.810]  excited to watch them and
[50:50.490 --> 50:51.730]  see
[50:51.730 --> 50:54.250]  humble grace grow and my friends and humble
[50:54.770 --> 50:59.410]  Keep the price of their pounds up and the and their and
[50:59.930 --> 51:04.490]  Get known for the quality is and the quality of the people who've become my friends
[51:06.610 --> 51:11.970]  That's so absolutely amazing Adam, thank you so much for that kind of in-depth view and I
[51:12.610 --> 51:16.530]  Think it's so important what you're doing sharing the stories of the past
[51:16.810 --> 51:23.090]  To shape the future and that's a big part of I think what all of us here are trying to do out of the Emerald
[51:23.090 --> 51:26.850]  Triangle community is to say hey, we've been doing this for
[51:27.530 --> 51:29.530]  20 30 40 60 years
[51:30.130 --> 51:32.570]  Take a look at what has made this community
[51:33.210 --> 51:40.450]  Thrive what has created the strength around it and allowed the survival to get us to this point and to be such a vocal
[51:41.930 --> 51:48.290]  Power in the change that's affecting the entire world currently in legislation and we have to celebrate these voices
[51:48.290 --> 51:56.050]  We have to let ourselves be heard and we want you at home to be heard get involved get out into your local
[51:56.530 --> 52:01.570]  You know meetings of you know boards of supervisors, etc local government and
[52:02.370 --> 52:04.370]  advocate to support
[52:04.450 --> 52:07.410]  small-scale organic community farming
[52:08.250 --> 52:09.890]  initiatives and
[52:09.890 --> 52:13.930]  to allow people with these businesses in these histories to thrive as
[52:14.890 --> 52:18.810]  Opposed to being taken over by this large corporate male-dominated
[52:20.050 --> 52:22.050]  culture that has really been
[52:22.690 --> 52:27.330]  kind of the whole point of the cannabis community fighting against it for the last 60 plus years, so
[52:28.930 --> 52:32.410]  Speaking of where's Caraco hiding in these videos?
[52:32.610 --> 52:39.330]  Tell us a little bit about your involvement and you know, all of the power of the women that you've been involved with
[52:40.210 --> 52:42.210]  facilitating so much change for our community
[52:43.050 --> 52:45.890]  Yeah, so I was lucky enough to
[52:47.130 --> 52:49.570]  be in the Bay Area and
[52:50.170 --> 52:53.650]  to start working in 20, let's see
[52:54.370 --> 53:01.290]  2015 we were doing it for a consulting firm in Oakland and we started a
[53:02.370 --> 53:09.850]  monthly Friday gathering at Lake Merritt and and it became really just an amazing collection of
[53:10.690 --> 53:12.690]  activists
[53:12.810 --> 53:14.130]  lawyers
[53:14.130 --> 53:18.890]  Consumers it was just a public consumption outdoor party
[53:18.890 --> 53:24.010]  And I think that's where I first met Adam. He came and was filming
[53:24.010 --> 53:27.370]  so there's a couple clips from from that and then
[53:29.010 --> 53:31.010]  We went to Denver
[53:31.650 --> 53:35.730]  when women grow had a huge gathering
[53:36.210 --> 53:38.210]  At the
[53:38.770 --> 53:44.410]  Courthouse it was the Denver Opera House the Denver Opera House. Yeah, 2016 February and
[53:45.490 --> 53:49.250]  and so that was like a really interesting moment because there was
[53:49.610 --> 53:55.850]  kind of that the upswell of like professionals coming in and was kind of not quite the
[53:56.530 --> 54:02.650]  Corporatization that I think we see as things are moving along, but it was like this rush of enthusiasm
[54:03.210 --> 54:06.130]  And opportunity and their scientists and
[54:06.970 --> 54:08.970]  Performers Melissa Etheridge was there
[54:09.650 --> 54:12.170]  And so there's a clip clip of me
[54:13.050 --> 54:15.050]  there at one point
[54:15.370 --> 54:19.650]  Incredibly high and singing this one-minute anthem that I'm really passionate about
[54:20.370 --> 54:23.330]  That hopefully will will show that clip in a moment
[54:24.290 --> 54:25.530]  and
[54:25.530 --> 54:29.770]  So I've just I've had my hands in the industry
[54:30.650 --> 54:36.250]  Or been whatever a stoner since 14 off and on so many years
[54:36.250 --> 54:42.810]  I did some smuggling back in my college days. I had a small indoor grow
[54:43.650 --> 54:47.210]  during 215 and San Francisco did some
[54:48.090 --> 54:52.650]  Distribution I was slinging pounds while pregnant in San Francisco
[54:53.650 --> 54:54.890]  and
[54:54.890 --> 54:56.890]  then I have
[54:57.050 --> 55:03.210]  Since then in 2016 actually moved up to Humboldt because I saw legalization coming here and
[55:03.650 --> 55:09.090]  was really concerned about our small outdoor organic farms and families and
[55:10.410 --> 55:15.810]  most recently worked with cooperation Humboldt to create the cooperative cannabis economy group where we're
[55:16.290 --> 55:20.530]  literally teaching cooperative skills and cooperative development to
[55:21.090 --> 55:27.850]  Groups of farmers that want to figure out how working together is gonna give them an advantage and and you know
[55:27.850 --> 55:31.970]  Part of it is that I'm passionate about the film is that it's you know
[55:31.970 --> 55:37.410]  It's very uplifting and I think it is a great like marketing piece for people to be like wow
[55:37.410 --> 55:39.810]  Look at these cool women these cool farms
[55:40.010 --> 55:47.210]  I'm gonna go into the dispensary and ask for some outdoor organic from Humboldt and that's what we need these days, right?
[55:47.210 --> 55:50.850]  We really need people to understand that outdoor
[55:51.450 --> 55:56.930]  Organic sun-grown soil like you taste that it changes your medicine
[55:56.930 --> 56:04.970]  It changes your experience and this film I feel is like an amazing tool to help communicate that across the world
[56:05.890 --> 56:10.750]  To serve again all of these farmers who like we wouldn't be here without you know
[56:10.750 --> 56:14.410]  The folks that endured camp without the folks that were like, yeah
[56:14.410 --> 56:17.890]  I'm willing to be an outlaw and take these risks risks
[56:18.650 --> 56:25.010]  And so that's that's again also the fire recovery. Why why bid on an auction item?
[56:25.970 --> 56:34.090]  Because not only do you get a cool thing, but you're literally keeping our community alive and we thank you for that
[56:34.610 --> 56:41.210]  Yeah, it's another great opportunity to vote with your dollars. You're gonna spend your dollars on these things out there in the world
[56:41.290 --> 56:47.410]  Anyway, what better way to let your voice be heard through supporting the community go out there
[56:48.530 --> 56:51.170]  smash the button make the bid and
[56:51.890 --> 56:58.330]  You know, you're giving money for things that have already kind of come through this channel to support the community
[56:58.330 --> 57:00.330]  These were donated these were
[57:00.450 --> 57:07.210]  Created to support this community. I think it's so so important to facilitate each other's support
[57:07.210 --> 57:11.730]  and that's one thing that I learned from moving to Humboldt and being in this community is
[57:12.050 --> 57:18.330]  If we take that extra little bit of effort to look closer at who you're supporting when you're spending that dollar
[57:18.330 --> 57:20.690]  You're gonna spend anyway, those choices
[57:21.330 --> 57:26.370]  Do make a difference and it is all about supporting that Sun Grown
[57:27.690 --> 57:33.130]  Rootsy sustainable cannabis that brought so many people here to spread this vibe, you know people like
[57:33.690 --> 57:39.330]  Crystal Ortiz from Urban Market and you know sunshine and all these dry farmers down in Shively and
[57:39.530 --> 57:45.410]  along the basins of the Eel River in Humboldt County and you're supporting these super niche communities and
[57:46.410 --> 57:50.130]  Women farmers who are out there spreading this information
[57:50.130 --> 57:55.730]  So I'm just blown away by what you've all accomplished with this film and I can't wait to get a closer look at it myself
[57:56.250 --> 58:00.770]  Let's cut to that clip. I think we've got it queued up of that one minute song
[58:00.770 --> 58:15.050]  Rolling rolling rolling keep them doobies rolling keep them hot and floating we're high
[58:17.050 --> 58:22.050]  Everything goes better when people smoke together
[58:23.050 --> 58:27.050]  Sharing and laughing feeling fine
[58:27.050 --> 58:33.050]  All the good we're missing under federal prohibition
[58:34.050 --> 58:38.050]  Wishing they let my friends outside
[58:39.050 --> 58:47.050]  Let them out let them vote let them work let them tote let them play let them say we're high
[58:49.050 --> 58:51.050]  We're high
[58:52.050 --> 59:10.360]  That was incredible
[59:10.360 --> 59:12.360]  That was incredible
[59:13.360 --> 59:15.360]  Thank you
[59:15.560 --> 59:19.840]  Thanks, I will say that the screenings we're gonna have them up here in Arcata
[59:22.000 --> 59:27.560]  Watch the humble grace site. We're not sure on the date yet. It's been a dance with
[59:28.360 --> 59:35.360]  Kovat Memorial Day all the things but well, we'll be landing the dates for live screenings with
[59:35.680 --> 59:37.680]  Some gathering
[59:37.680 --> 59:45.280]  So, please yeah and all and as we said Adam has donated those screenings, which will be the first, you know public
[59:45.800 --> 59:46.640]  private
[59:46.640 --> 59:48.640]  You know invitation screenings
[59:49.560 --> 59:54.440]  To the humble grace fire recovery. So that's like super special
[59:55.480 --> 01:00:00.160]  Yeah, I might have failed to mention that, you know, I have a special kind of
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:07.480]  Empathy for growers and people who are burnt out in the fires because in 2018 November fires
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:14.200]  Southern California. I lost my home on a 20 acre organic farm everything I own but at
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:21.600]  10 to 7 the morning made it out with these two 15 terabyte hard drives with most of these films on it
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:25.200]  so somebody was watching over something, but I
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.000]  Know what it's like to go through that loss
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.240]  For real and one of the other pieces I think that's really unique in how Adams
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.880]  You know, we're working on rolling the film at is really to leverage it in local communities
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:45.760]  So, you know, he had a film on Netflix for eight years. He's got the connections. He's in LA
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:53.280]  Instead of going straight to streaming. We really want to build a groundswell support the women in the film Sunshine Johnson
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.280]  As you mentioned she's in the film
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.800]  Among many many other amazing
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:04.000]  Individuals and so, you know, we want to do these screenings where we can bring community together
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.560]  raise funds for a good cause
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:14.240]  And and build that groundswell before we look at Adam looks at you know, what would be the best way to get it out globally?
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:18.520]  Great. Yeah, basically my perspective on is simply that
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:22.960]  It's a women's empowerment film is really what it is
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.080]  And showing that connectivity
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.520]  connected tissue to what you're rolling up right there and
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:36.560]  The model for getting it out just like your guys new models for sustaining yourselves and getting this thing going
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.120]  Most artists, you know, you sell a painting in a gallery the gallery gets half your money
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:47.120]  My attitude was like fuck that I'll give half of it way and I'd like to give it to
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.720]  You know walk the walk and you know, I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna give it to you
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.760]  walk the walk and
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.480]  Well women
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.760]  supportive nonprofits
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:06.320]  so that's how I'm rolling with this and just I'm just most concerned with anybody who would want to see this film and
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.800]  could use it for good purpose for women's empowerment and
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.960]  for all the associated cannabis people empowerment is what it's about
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:23.400]  I'll get to the broader masses in the public later. We'll build it and they will come so I'm not worried about that part
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.400]  This is my focus
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:34.000]  But I think it's so incredible that you've come together to bring together decades of experience and wisdom
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:41.640]  to elevate both of these platforms at the same time and personally I can say as somebody who's never been affected by a fire that
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.840]  This project means so much to those that have and
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:52.160]  It's really hard to ever even imagine what folks like yourself have gone through who have actually dealt with losing
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.360]  everything or even just something
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:01.480]  To the fire even to fleeing and coming home and having your home there that you're never the same person after an experience like that
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:09.520]  So again get out hit those bid items people. It's so super duper important and find other ways to support this community
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.960]  Absolutely, absolutely, you know, absolutely and you know, I always say the same thing, but you know
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:21.140]  I am as an environmentalist just looking at our whole this Mike with subculture
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:27.680]  we're all in and how the dominant culture can learn so much and we're not going to survive by
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:34.320]  evolving wings or talons or tails how we are going to evolve is in our consciousness and
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:38.400]  what we celebrate with this female plant and
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.520]  our own pursuits
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.800]  aligns
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.800]  with this and
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:52.560]  You know peace and health prosperity and our connection with the planet
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:01.160]  Absolutely incredible and what better vehicle for evolving that consciousness than cannabis and sharing it together
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.280]  through communities, absolutely
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.640]  Nice, you know
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:11.760]  I wanted to pop in and say at the end here that one of the things that attracted me to Adams film is
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.500]  That there's over 200 women in it
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.600]  it's really a collective a
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:25.520]  collection of female experiences and perspectives through this industry
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:31.120]  and and we are also diverse and this plant is so diverse and
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:39.000]  This this film shows that and I really appreciated that thanks Cara and Adam for coming on and thank you
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:45.080]  Adam for for donating the film the screen to the foundation the way you have
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.760]  and for allowing Cara and I to build this butterfly effect that we see in
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:58.800]  Taking it into other cities and empowering other organizations and women the way you're allowing us to so thank you so much for that
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.200]  Absolutely
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.000]  Appreciate it. All right. I want to show one more clip
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:10.520]  And then we'll move on. Thank you so much you guys and everyone. Please go to the bidding
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:17.640]  I put these QR codes on here so you guys can just throw your phone on the screen. There's so many amazing items
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:23.240]  We're gonna go through some more Michael and I will after this clip
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:33.740]  I
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:43.700]  With the Arizona Cannabis Nurses Association
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:48.460]  We're the ones responsible for getting PTSD added in the state of Arizona
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:53.600]  And we're now working to get Parkinson's disease Huntington's disease traumatic brain injury autism
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.220]  several other conditions added as well
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:03.860]  This is J one I
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:21.640]  Love that with Heather Manish at the end going this is J one just like a lady who knows her
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.160]  Adelia are you with us?
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.280]  Hello
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:36.240]  No one thing. I don't think we mentioned is all the different platforms. We're streaming from today. We're everywhere right now, right?
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:42.320]  We're on Twitter YouTube LinkedIn and then on multiple Facebook pages as well, right?
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:50.400]  Yes, we are. We we have managed to have some amazing folks support us on all their platforms
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:55.980]  We've got the future cannabis project on their YouTube. We've got canna boomer
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:01.040]  Cannabis Business Alliance Royal Grown Radio is shooting this out here
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:05.120]  You'll you are on event. Hi. I am on Humboldt grace
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.880]  Ethica Data Alliance is is streaming this
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:15.280]  On my screen right now. It says it's out on ten different channels
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.080]  That's amazing
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:26.520]  Types of groups too. So all different types of people are tuning in right now from all over that's exactly
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.160]  Yes, we we took the old-school
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:35.720]  Work in the back road system and we're putting it into the digital era
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.440]  This is how the cannabis industry was built
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:44.640]  Originally is we had to figure out how to make it work with what we had and that's what we're doing here
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.720]  Yeah, big shout out to future cannabis project and Peter
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.940]  So if you are a what great stewards of the industry sharing information
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.720]  And sharing the voices of the people in the community
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:00.880]  What a great platform that they're hosting so thanks for sharing us there as well
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:07.760]  So while unfortunately our next next guest Wendy edge is ill, you know
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:11.760]  A lot of us are patients myself included so I can definitely
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.880]  Empathize with that and we just have to keep going with the flow
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:23.040]  so I would love to take a few minutes one to thank all of you watching and tuning in and
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:29.480]  Adelia you and Michael for spending your Sundays doing this to raise funds for our community
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:36.560]  And cat back there making my life way easier, you know, thanks cat. Yeah
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:44.280]  We've done a few of these productions and this has been the smoothest easiest one
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:50.600]  Adelia don't you think because we've had all this support. It's just it's it's been a potluck production
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.400]  Definitely all came together so well
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.800]  And I think it's working well, well I would like to show the audience a
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:05.800]  Few more items and I would love to know Adelia and Michael
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.820]  What do you see? Have you taken a look at the auction?
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:13.160]  And what do you see that would that you think is really interesting on there? We can show it now
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:19.600]  Well, the one I'm looking at right now is actually when from Wendy and it's her blue dream her artwork
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.200]  Oh, let's find it. Yes. Yeah, so
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:25.400]  It's a blue dream
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:31.960]  It's a depiction of the artist's mental and physical state while medicating with the cannabis strain blue dream
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.080]  So it's a huge canvas 18 by 24
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.560]  It includes organic Arkansas hemp and acrylic paint. It looks beautiful
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:49.480]  Yeah, it does doesn't it and if there you can see I don't know if you guys can see this but on my computer
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:55.600]  You can see how there's all this texture to it from the hemp and it is hemp folks
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.480]  I asked her so nobody will get in trouble
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  Us shipping this to you
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:10.200]  But it is a beautiful piece and if you guys haven't if you if you don't know who Wendy edge is you have to tune
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:14.960]  In she's got a show on multiple networks. She's streaming on this network
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:19.160]  She's also one of the reasons that we get to reproduce this for public television
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.840]  in Texas and another state in Chicago
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:31.160]  But she is a great activist of this plant and does some amazing interviews. So please go check her out and
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.440]  Bid, this is an amazing piece of work
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:39.320]  All right. How about how about something else? How about something else? That was fun
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.800]  so one thing that I've been seeing on here is
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:49.640]  You have a lot of very small businesses contributing, you know relatively significant things for them
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:55.200]  One that I noticed is the kiss canoe CBD products bundle. This is a tiny business
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.840]  that really
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.040]  They farm all all of their own cannabis. They do a great job
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.440]  They have you know
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:11.160]  Estate grown top quality products and some of the most amazing beauty products out there and their value here at
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.240]  $290 for that bundle their face oil is the next level
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:23.040]  That's a really really cool prize package and something that you can get way below market value right now
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:28.320]  $52 get in there and smash that bid because you they can't make that
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.320]  For $52 so, you know people out there giving these products
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:39.280]  From very slim lined businesses with you know, we're fighting to survive right now
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.800]  These are the people that we want to support through this. These are the people that we want to
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:49.580]  Keep in the community supporting each other. So that was a really significant item to me to see on there
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:55.060]  You know really good point Michael. I actually use this their items
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.720]  and they are
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.640]  Made local and they are made with the finest ingredients
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.600]  But they've also done something else
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:12.020]  Gretchen and Jason have also managed to break through and gotten on the shelves of Nordstrom's in other stores like that
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.880]  so they are proof that we as
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:23.220]  Curators of this plant and of you know craft can break through to that next level
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.940]  To change our ways to get there and
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:33.780]  Gretchen is another great woman in cannabis and I encourage you to seek what she's contributing to the community out
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:40.060]  She's involved with Humboldt grace involved with so many other women in cannabis projects out there
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:47.480]  Being a boss lady being the CEO being involved in the everyday business and it's just inspirational
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.200]  To see these communities come together
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:56.440]  And this is another opportunity for me to thank all of the women here who have brought me in to be involved. I feel
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:03.400]  like an outlier in the group is the only male here conducting interviews and special to be included and
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:10.360]  Invited into such a you know, awe-inspiring group of women. So, you know, thank you for that for all of you
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.200]  Thank you, Michael
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.320]  I
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:21.180]  Wanted to put this one up because I believe our next guest is another well
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:26.840]  We have two badass women and the first one I want to talk about is Nicole Friar
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:33.160]  She is one of the owners and developers of the social spa, which is an all
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.160]  consumption spa in Humboldt County
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.600]  and
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:43.400]  There's a there's a the Scotia Lodge, which is also a place which I think here you go
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:49.120]  You can stay at and they've offered a night stay for two with a couples massage
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:53.280]  And Nicole is gonna be on here in just a few
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.920]  To talk more about what she's doing
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.960]  and
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:07.080]  What fun it is to come visit Humboldt County and then another woman that we have coming up at the same time
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:08.760]  With
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.160]  Nicole
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:14.280]  Is season George and what you're looking at right now is?
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.720]  Season has a farm five sisters farm and they do
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.520]  Glamping and she has also
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.280]  offered glamping stays
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:30.480]  You can bid on and here's a little look of what it would look like. I love this bathtub
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:33.680]  I grew up without their baths and I just love this
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.080]  You know
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:45.520]  Well one comment I'm seeing here is to is going back to the first item is a
[01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.960]  Scotia lounge Lodge is a consumption friendly hotel as well. So that's a great
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:58.400]  Consumption friendly good to know good to know do we have our next guests on yet you guys
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.240]  Or do we have Nicole and season?
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.880]  And Matt we do not pull. Let's see
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:10.680]  Cat I know I know you can hear me, but I have you on
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:17.080]  Screens and I just got a note that someone can't get on and I'm wondering if that's Nicole
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:23.560]  Okay, I know Matt is here. And so let's see. Let me see if I get myself off the screen if that works
[01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:36.590]  And a really great way to
[01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:39.830]  Keep my finger on the pulse of what's happening with the consumer
[01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:42.510]  you know and
[01:19:42.670 --> 01:19:45.750]  Educate them on how to find sun grown in the dispensary
[01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:54.070]  Dragonfly earth medicine certified and Sun and Earth certified. So those programs have been a really great way to do outreach
[01:19:55.910 --> 01:20:02.190]  It's great to work with Matt and that's been one of my first supporters for sure and now Nicole good to see you guys
[01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:10.030]  Let's go down to Matt and then we'll go to Nicole right after
[01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:15.910]  Hi everybody, I'm Matt from Humboldt cannabis tours and I started humble cannabis tours in
[01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:19.110]  2015 and yeah, we do
[01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:25.710]  Tours to working cannabis farms. So we kind of started my office and we drive out
[01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:27.710]  We visit awesome farms like season farms
[01:20:27.710 --> 01:20:35.390]  and we talk to the farmers and we learn all about the plants and it's really focused on education and learning and building
[01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:37.710]  relationships with the plant and
[01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:40.470]  The plant and the farmers who grow it
[01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:43.550]  and
[01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:46.630]  What what was the other question why the Emerald Triangle
[01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:50.790]  The importance of Emerald try, you know the importance of building
[01:20:51.670 --> 01:20:53.670]  attention to Emerald Triangle
[01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:56.230]  Well for me, I think it's really important
[01:20:56.230 --> 01:20:58.830]  I think we have a lot of we have a different way of living here
[01:20:58.830 --> 01:21:03.750]  We have a different way of making food and we have a different way of relating to each other and different way of like relating
[01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:09.710]  That I think is more sustainable in the long term like just in the larger society and
[01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:15.950]  We can share that with people like for example season does this awesome stuff called hugel culture, which is really cool
[01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:18.390]  way of gardening with the earth
[01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:23.590]  But we can through cannabis we can like share that with other people because a lot of people learn about
[01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:29.430]  Sustainability through cannabis like I know a lot of people who started growing weed in a closet and then ten years later
[01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:33.990]  They're doing hugel cultures and KNF and all this stuff. I think we can share that with the world
[01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:37.790]  And Nicole
[01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:41.230]  Hi everyone. I'm Nicole. I am
[01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:42.990]  the
[01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:50.070]  Owner of the social spas. It's one of the first day spas and consumption lounge where we can actually apply
[01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:53.630]  THC as a topical so that's really exciting
[01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:56.350]  I'm also
[01:21:56.750 --> 01:22:01.010]  Working with Matt Kurth and season is one of our farmers
[01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:07.110]  But Matt and I we have developed a three-day cannabis experience here in Humboldt County
[01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:11.910]  So we're really excited about that Humboldt holiday. I thought it was really important
[01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:15.870]  There's definitely a need for tourism here in Humboldt County
[01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:23.510]  And I think that being able to present it to the world the way that we live and not through someone else's eyes
[01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:29.790]  And really be able to you know highlight our community and all of the different
[01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:35.590]  Brands and partners that we've been working with and I'm just super excited to be able to show that
[01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:39.270]  Well, thank all three of you for being here
[01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:44.310]  And I love the collaboration, you know, that's really how we continue to support each other
[01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:47.470]  I mean, it's it's incorporated you all have done this for generations
[01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:53.550]  You know and just seeing it and incorporating into the industry and the community continuing for it is great and huge
[01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:57.670]  Season so at five sisters farms, you know
[01:22:57.670 --> 01:23:03.090]  You've created a whole experience to really engage and showcase the beauty of Emerald Triangle
[01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:11.150]  What can people expect when visiting your farm and why did you choose to incorporate more of a personal educational approach?
[01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:16.430]  With the dragonfly earth medicine
[01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:18.470]  certification
[01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:20.470]  Community outreach is a requirement
[01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:28.550]  I also have a background in garden education through my work with a nonprofit to Mayan garden project back in early
[01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:30.390]  2000 so being
[01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:37.430]  using a garden as a tool as a gathering space as a cultural hub is something that's really familiar to me and
[01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:43.150]  I knew I was kind of at a hot spot location on the highway here
[01:23:43.630 --> 01:23:48.990]  I'm in between two festival sites where reggae on the river happened and that's been a
[01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:51.590]  Cannabis tourism Mecca for you know
[01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:58.530]  Jen for decades and so I really wanted to and as I saw the things changing around around me
[01:23:58.530 --> 01:24:00.630]  You know a big corporation moved in next door
[01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:08.330]  Reggae on the river with a grassroots organization nonprofit kind of subsided and a for-profit, you know thing kind of popped up
[01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:13.170]  and so I really wanted to just be in the middle of that and like hold a space of the ways of
[01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:22.210]  Just a simple gardening, you know, just really just show that like one person can do it, you know here I'm a 100% owner
[01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:27.010]  I'm the cultivator. I'm the curator, you know when people come to five sisters farm
[01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:32.290]  They meet me they see me what you know doing what I do and it's just really authentic
[01:24:32.290 --> 01:24:32.650]  You know
[01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:40.330]  And I know that other garden tours or you know facility tours. They see greenhouses they see
[01:24:40.570 --> 01:24:43.930]  You know warehouses but not very many places
[01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:48.270]  Can you come and just see like big plants like it was back and you know back in the day?
[01:24:48.330 --> 01:24:53.610]  So I hope to kind of preserve that that old way of growing and just and let people just be with the plant
[01:24:53.770 --> 01:24:59.050]  It's really simple, you know, a lot of people are using cannabis these days and they don't smoke flower
[01:24:59.330 --> 01:25:06.690]  You know, they they consume it in a way that's like a soda or a sublingual and they don't have a connection with the actual
[01:25:07.490 --> 01:25:08.450]  flower itself
[01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:14.570]  so being with the plant and just kind of giving them a place to be with source something as gentle and as
[01:25:15.130 --> 01:25:22.090]  You know as simple as that it can make a really big impact and I just really you know, I value Matt's business
[01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:25.450]  It's a lot, you know, he he really
[01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:27.930]  these types of
[01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:29.250]  win-win
[01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:31.370]  relationships and you know, Nicole
[01:25:32.450 --> 01:25:34.450]  Promoting me. It's really a big deal
[01:25:34.650 --> 01:25:39.790]  You know, I'd like to be that a success an example of successful collaboration
[01:25:40.810 --> 01:25:47.130]  Well, and you actually did donate a two-night farm stay at your farm at five sisters farms
[01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:55.330]  And a little bit more insight into your farm. It's organic sustainable regenerative cannabis. You offer the tours camping and education
[01:25:55.810 --> 01:26:00.890]  Right now I mean this is valued at three hundred and ten dollars. This is a still right now what people are
[01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:04.650]  It's currently 87. So I would say people need to start making their bids
[01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:08.610]  Right away and thank you for donating that
[01:26:09.930 --> 01:26:13.710]  The next question will go to Nicole Nicole
[01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:19.890]  Can you share a bit more about Humboldt social and the experiences you all provide for your guests?
[01:26:19.930 --> 01:26:24.570]  You know, it sounds like there's a huge component again to around education and showing them
[01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:27.410]  The beauty of Emerald Triangle as a whole
[01:26:28.810 --> 01:26:30.010]  Yeah
[01:26:30.010 --> 01:26:32.010]  So yeah humbled social
[01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:38.650]  We really try to emphasize normalizing cannabis and being transparent about what we're doing in
[01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:45.490]  Normalizing it in a way where we use it in a daily what on topicals and your food, you know
[01:26:45.490 --> 01:26:47.490]  You can smoke it you can drink it
[01:26:47.850 --> 01:26:52.050]  But also just providing a space where people can come and experience
[01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:56.490]  cannabis and talk about it with people who are educated and
[01:26:58.530 --> 01:27:01.610]  People that really want to you know, just know about the plant
[01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:05.650]  Now and then you also
[01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:09.770]  Word you also donated an item Lele was just speaking about as well
[01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:14.810]  And so I'm gonna pull that up really quick and just go over. I
[01:27:15.810 --> 01:27:17.810]  Can pull it up quick enough
[01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:23.210]  And while I'm pulling that up I actually had a second question for you
[01:27:23.210 --> 01:27:29.450]  Why is keeping the culture alive so important for the cannabis community? I think that it's really important
[01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:32.250]  This is a whole thing up here. It's a whole vibe
[01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:38.590]  There's generations that have you know came here and I think that's really important that we highlight that
[01:27:38.690 --> 01:27:44.010]  It's not just about corporate. This is about people. This is a brand. These are faces
[01:27:44.010 --> 01:27:48.570]  These are families. This is really their livelihood and this is what they do
[01:27:48.570 --> 01:27:52.970]  They came here to be able to live a life that was fulfilling for them
[01:27:52.970 --> 01:28:00.490]  And I think what's happening now is that it's just becoming just it's out of their hands and it's really important that we really try
[01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:01.770]  to
[01:28:01.770 --> 01:28:06.450]  You know highlight that and just really cultivate it and make sure we keep it as our own
[01:28:07.770 --> 01:28:09.610]  Thank you for sharing that
[01:28:09.610 --> 01:28:15.810]  And then we have if this is coming up correctly yours is the one-night stay correct at the yes
[01:28:16.330 --> 01:28:22.370]  Kosher Lodge and and you also incorporated a couples massage with that as well. Yeah, they're getting full experience
[01:28:23.490 --> 01:28:27.170]  Absolutely. Yes, and so that current bid is 200 right now
[01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:33.650]  The Scotia Lodge is a hundred-year hotel located by the northern entrance to the Avenue of the Giants in Northern, California
[01:28:34.570 --> 01:28:38.830]  This is a intimate very intimate beautiful location
[01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:43.570]  There's 22 rooms and suites. You also have a kitchen and bar and event spaces
[01:28:43.570 --> 01:28:50.090]  So there's so much that can happen at your at your location. Yeah, absolutely. There's a lot of activity. It's awesome
[01:28:50.170 --> 01:28:52.090]  We can also do
[01:28:52.090 --> 01:28:59.470]  Cannabis consumption on site and we also have cannabis delivery. So that's really exciting. So yeah lots of activities
[01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:03.790]  Well, thank you for that and now Matt, you know
[01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:09.490]  So at humble cannabis tours, you are bringing out tourists and travelers on tours throughout humble
[01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:14.590]  Why was creating this business an important component for you and for the community?
[01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:19.470]  So I think
[01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:21.830]  Yeah, humble has a lot to share with the rest of the world
[01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:28.490]  like my goal is if I can make the rest of the world like a tiny bit a little bit more like
[01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:31.690]  Humble is the place I love that was that would be awesome. So
[01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:34.810]  It's all about kind of spreading
[01:29:35.130 --> 01:29:38.530]  like things spreading humble around to the rest of the world and
[01:29:38.810 --> 01:29:42.370]  Kind of letting showing people there's a different way to live a lot of people
[01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:46.330]  They kind of feel a lot of my guests a lot of people to come to my tours
[01:29:46.330 --> 01:29:50.570]  they feel like they're locked into their lives like down in the city kind of in the rat race and
[01:29:50.770 --> 01:29:53.410]  A lot of people don't see an alternative to that
[01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:59.770]  And that is disheartening and I think coming to humble it shows it like there's another way to do
[01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:04.970]  There's another way to live life. Like we can be interconnected. We can have a community
[01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:11.410]  We can produce our own food and our own beer our own weed and our own medicine and we can take care of ourselves
[01:30:11.410 --> 01:30:13.810]  And we can make our own we can set our own norms
[01:30:13.810 --> 01:30:15.810]  We can do things the way we want to do them
[01:30:15.850 --> 01:30:19.090]  We can raise our own kids and we can build our own radio station
[01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:23.650]  We can have our own music festivals and I think just sharing that with other people like that
[01:30:23.650 --> 01:30:28.010]  That's possible. Like we're one of the last places kind of in the United States, but there's no
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:16.540]  Japan
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:20.380]  And what I'd like to get some folks from China out here. I'm really looking for some folks in China
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:26.420]  It's harder for them to do the cannabis thing. They have some more restrictions. Yeah people come from all over the world
[01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:29.260]  Yeah, and all over the country, too
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:32.820]  And we have something that's been unique here
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:36.940]  We have something that they don't have us that we don't have other places and now for the first time ever
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:40.740]  We want to share it with people before we didn't want to share it or we couldn't share it with people in the way
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:46.940]  We wanted to but now for the first time ever. We want to welcome people from all over to come experience that
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:55.060]  Sharing that now and you also donated a humble cannabis towards half day. So this is for two
[01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:57.900]  What can people expect with that?
[01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:02.300]  So we start the tour at our office in Eureka
[01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:08.220]  and we get in our nice shiny van and we drive out to a working cannabis farm like season farm and
[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:12.620]  and we talk all the way down there about the regulations and the science and
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:15.860]  Just all kinds of stuff the history of humble
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:21.300]  Why humble became humble a lot of people have that question like why a lot of people know humble
[01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:25.260]  But a lot of people say why how did humble become humble? Why is humble humble?
[01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:28.140]  So we talked about that all the way down there and we get to the farm
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:30.740]  We're greeted by the farmer and they come out and meet us
[01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:36.140]  which is always the highlight is the farmer and then the farmer shows us around the farm and we
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:40.380]  Answer questions and talk about what's going on at the farm at that time of the year
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:45.620]  We see the plants we smell the plant and we spend about an hour and a half at the farm
[01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:51.940]  And then we get back in the van and we visited a sensory where usually we can buy that farmers product
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:57.180]  Or other local humble products and then we head on back to our office in Eureka
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:02.500]  So that's the half day tour and then the awesome tour that I'm working on
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:08.260]  With Nicole and season is the humble holiday tour, which is a three-day all-inclusive
[01:34:08.780 --> 01:34:16.580]  tour with all the accommodations and spa treatments and spa visits and wine tasting and food
[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:23.860]  Delicious local food all included. So the half day is really awesome in the I was really I'm really happy to offer that in the option
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:27.740]  And that's a great thing to do because you can do Redwoods and stuff in the other time
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:32.580]  But if you want a big experience, I'm really excited about the humble holiday that we have coming up
[01:34:33.140 --> 01:34:34.260]  Yeah
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:37.260]  Season, is there anything you'd like to add about that special collaboration?
[01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:40.180]  For your from your side of it
[01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:49.020]  For me it was a big relief to have Nicole put this together because you know, like I said, I'm I'm the farmer
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:52.340]  It's it's a look it's a joy to open up the space
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:56.940]  But it's a it's a whole new skill to be in the hospitality industry on top of farming
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:02.820]  And so it you know Matt's been a support but then to have Nicole do this outreach
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:03.300]  You know
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:10.180]  It it makes it's a it's a farther reach because the people who book with me and who want to come they are already into
[01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:16.740]  Regenerative farming there. There's somebody who wants to camp here who want but somebody who's gonna have a luxury tour. That's a
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:21.620]  Demographic I may not be able to reach and so it makes a big difference
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:26.460]  and I mean just being here's a great example of women supporting women and
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:32.580]  You know, I just that's something I want to live by so it's great. I and Matt to
[01:36:10.650 --> 01:36:11.850]  At
[01:36:11.850 --> 01:36:16.610]  Gmail for any inquiries and we will certainly get back to them. Yes AP
[01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:19.450]  We're really excited to roll this out and share the community
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:59.200]  And lately, thank you for joining thank you. Thank you all of you. I want to go on the humble holiday
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:10.560]  With the beginning of the of the rally we showed a little bit of what Matt's holiday looks like
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:15.080]  And so you can get an idea of what all of these folks holiday will look like
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.760]  But I wanted to thank all of you for coming on and especially it being a Sunday
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:21.480]  and
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:23.480]  for sticking
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:27.840]  With it because it is a grind and it is
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:32.720]  Locked there's lots of fear and there there's lots of like we can't do this
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:36.340]  But if you look back, I bet all three of you look back over your shoulders
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:43.540]  You have accomplished more things and done crazier things than the majority of the world has these days
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:47.440]  And we can do this. We just have to keep working together
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:50.280]  Thank you
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:54.400]  All right. Let's show a video of humble cannabis for as well
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:58.400]  We move on to we've got actually we're trying something new
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:02.760]  We've got Michael and Kelly in the studio is where we'll be going next
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:19.440]  Oh
[01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:18.790]  Just warming it up for you Lele. All right. I have my butt my butt gonna need a warm seat
[01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:26.750]  All right, well I am gonna let you take over Michael so it can be full-screen good to see you
[01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:32.350]  Well, thank you all once again for being here this is really special to me
[01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:36.510]  This is putting me back in my element. I'm really really happy to be here with Kelly O'Rourke of
[01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:39.310]  RAF or RAF Humboldt
[01:39:40.190 --> 01:39:43.470]  Redwood Alternative Alliance Fund and they're doing
[01:39:44.230 --> 01:39:49.350]  Agriculture funding I made this mistake right before when I asked Kelly about it and she corrected me already once
[01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:54.270]  It's a tongue twister, but our a AF they're doing amazing things
[01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:55.270]  and
[01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:59.870]  one of the benefits of my job and the beauty of my job is I get to go visit all these farms like
[01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:07.750]  They're doing in the tourism council and it's also part of what makes Kelly's job so special is she's out there getting to interact with
[01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:09.550]  the farmers and support
[01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:10.550]  regenerative
[01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:18.270]  Agriculture. So tell us a little bit about RAF and how you're connecting this community to the bureaucracy
[01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:23.110]  That's a good way to put it. So our a F is
[01:40:24.150 --> 01:40:26.790]  Nonprofit we are tax exempt at the federal level
[01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:31.630]  Which is a big win for a cannabis organization and what we do is last year
[01:40:31.630 --> 01:40:39.590]  We subsidized Sun and Earth certified and simply eco certified their sustainability and regenerative farming certifications for cannabis and hemp
[01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:47.750]  He's got one of our wonderful farms here in humble Huckleberry Hills. Shout out Johnny and his no helicopter
[01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:49.750]  So nurse certified up there
[01:40:50.590 --> 01:40:55.070]  Essentially they got their son on earth certification for free last year because of our program
[01:40:55.470 --> 01:40:59.950]  Which was funded through a project trellis micro grant and that's one of our local
[01:41:00.630 --> 01:41:06.630]  Programs here in the county. So yeah, we just raised money to help out people build their businesses and you know
[01:41:06.630 --> 01:41:13.950]  Congregate around a certain set of values which in in senator's case is growing cannabis in the ground under the Sun
[01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:17.750]  Paying people fairly and engaging with the communities
[01:41:18.630 --> 01:41:23.030]  It's such a cool project because we hear time and time again people are struggling
[01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:30.950]  Regenerative farmers in particularly are struggling to get their product out there to get the funding they need to bring this
[01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:36.230]  Impeccable quality medicine to the people and to be able to continue to cultivate
[01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:42.070]  These are farm first people that have been connected with the land learning how to farm regeneratively
[01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:45.550]  And that is an amazingly demanding process
[01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:52.710]  And so they need this help to go out and find a way to be funded to get certified to celebrate
[01:41:53.470 --> 01:41:54.550]  and share
[01:41:54.550 --> 01:42:00.750]  This role that they're playing they need to tell the consumer. We need to find more ways to inform the consumer as
[01:42:01.230 --> 01:42:06.590]  To what these people are bringing to the table and that's a big part of what our AAF does
[01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:12.430]  you know, I would say our AAF is a small part of what the community is doing and
[01:42:13.630 --> 01:42:20.750]  And I think part of what makes the program successful is its smallness and it's sort of singular focus on one little area that we
[01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:25.190]  Can do a little bit of good in do that really? Well not try to take on the whole world
[01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:28.710]  And it did it helped, you know, I think we saved
[01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:31.990]  $36,000 worth of certification fees for
[01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:39.030]  Humboldt County farmers alone and and this next year there's like really exciting things happening that I can't even really talk about yet
[01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:42.070]  But I I don't know a little nervous
[01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:48.670]  This is amazing. So we had an opportunity a little over a year ago to meet actually for the first time
[01:42:48.670 --> 01:42:51.030]  On a farm on Royal Grown Radio
[01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:55.830]  Visit at Phoenix Rising Farms big shout out to you Casey out there
[01:42:55.830 --> 01:43:01.190]  One of the most amazing regenerative farmers out there educating growing amazing cannabis
[01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:04.150]  check them out if you get a chance, but we got to meet and
[01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:09.190]  This was at the very beginning of the program and you guys were just kind of getting started
[01:43:09.190 --> 01:43:14.590]  So in that year since we talked and had an amazing emotional connection
[01:43:14.590 --> 01:43:19.250]  I encourage everyone to find that episode on Royal Grown Radio because it was a special moment for all of us
[01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:23.470]  but tell us about what's happened in the last year and how
[01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:27.870]  You facilitated these changes. It was a it was a long season
[01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:31.550]  I think a lot of people in the community had a long season to
[01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:39.270]  Over the course of the year. I visited over 30 regenerative farms in Humboldt and Mendocino Sonoma, Nevada County
[01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:41.870]  I got out there and around and honestly
[01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:46.710]  I've got one of the best jobs out there because I got to see the cream of the crop and we're you know
[01:43:46.710 --> 01:43:53.910]  You're talking about these beautiful plants in the ground this farm down in Mendocino Sun roots with like mulch this thick
[01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:59.590]  Earthworms everywhere is so beautiful. So, you know, I visited about 30 farms
[01:43:59.590 --> 01:44:05.030]  We got I think 26 farms certified for free in Humboldt County through the program
[01:44:05.230 --> 01:44:09.430]  We received our IRS tax exemption, which was really really cool
[01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:13.270]  I presented directly to the cannabis ad hoc committee and you know
[01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:17.470]  Talk to them about the importance of regenerative agriculture and why they really need to consider
[01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:21.550]  Helping these guys out at the tax level at the county level
[01:44:22.030 --> 01:44:27.690]  Thinking about certification as a way to think about tax incentives and accountability
[01:44:27.690 --> 01:44:30.890]  I showed them some of our reporting forms and how in-depth and how
[01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:35.150]  Detailed how much these people have to go through to become certified
[01:44:35.150 --> 01:44:38.110]  It's not just like a write-in and we'll take your word for it
[01:44:38.110 --> 01:44:41.270]  You know people come out there and we take soil samples
[01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:47.990]  We're taking a deep dive into their records to make sure that everything they're using is kosher and groovy and it's not easy
[01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:53.830]  Considering what they're already facing at every level of trying to be an operation
[01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:58.590]  And so most of our people here in California can't directly market to the consumer
[01:44:58.590 --> 01:45:02.470]  And if they do they had to go through a lot to get that micro business license
[01:45:03.110 --> 01:45:05.110]  and so Sun and Earth a
[01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:08.630]  Certification like that there's all kinds of other certifications out there
[01:45:08.630 --> 01:45:13.510]  But this is the one that I am most, you know in love with I guess as far as what it stands for
[01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:18.590]  It's it's just a way of saying these are our values and this is you know
[01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:23.150]  The kind of values that's going into the medicine that we grow. So yeah, I think this is kind of
[01:45:24.590 --> 01:45:28.590]  Cool strengths about the Sun Earth cert team is you know, there's a huge
[01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:35.930]  Community effort and deep ties to some of the original organic farmers and original Omri certifiers Jeremy Lord
[01:45:37.630 --> 01:45:39.250]  Big shout out to Jeremy
[01:45:39.250 --> 01:45:44.710]  He's a huge influence on this community and been a part of the organic farming community here for
[01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:50.850]  40 plus years through his family and you know, you talk about generational contributions to Humboldt County
[01:45:50.850 --> 01:45:55.150]  Yeah, that's them and that's what this project is
[01:45:55.550 --> 01:46:02.430]  Bringing to the people and helping to facilitate changes people who are hesitant to throw those bottles away move away from
[01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:08.650]  You know salt based fertilizers because they're worried about their bottom line and rightfully so in this time and place
[01:46:08.650 --> 01:46:10.950]  You know, I got to visit a really cool farm
[01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:16.110]  Villa Paradiso is out in the Palo Verde area this year. I mean, it's it's
[01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:18.310]  Bob
[01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:22.190]  Stefano runs this place and one of the most beautiful regenerative farms
[01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:25.510]  He told me that it was he was sitting in jail and
[01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:31.990]  Thinking about the amount of fuel he had spent on diesel generators growing and he was like never again. I'm growing in the ground
[01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:33.990]  I'm gonna change the way I'm doing things
[01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:38.310]  and what's really cool is I also got to visit his daughter's farm and
[01:46:39.650 --> 01:46:43.070]  Certify them. So both of these this a two generations of
[01:46:43.670 --> 01:46:51.390]  Organic regenerative farmers this year got their certifications for free through raft. It's a very small little piece, but you know, definitely the legacy
[01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:57.550]  of humbled and of the Emerald Triangle at least a part of that legacy is a great care for the earth and
[01:46:58.310 --> 01:47:02.790]  Concerned for the way that we do things not just the way that we grow but the way that we do business
[01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:07.710]  it's so incredible that you got to visit the one farm and the daughter's farm and
[01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:10.510]  That's just a testament to that
[01:47:10.910 --> 01:47:18.150]  Legacy concept and what we're trying to share with the world in this community in the humble grace community and the people were trying to
[01:47:18.150 --> 01:47:24.750]  Support through the fire recovery project. There are these legacy farmers where father son grandfather daughter all
[01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:30.590]  Have been affected by these fires and these are part of the tools we have to continue to support them
[01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:35.310]  you know getting involved in Sun Earth sir getting involved in in wrath and
[01:47:35.710 --> 01:47:41.270]  Looking at different tools to access public funding to support these farmers
[01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:44.870]  And that's a big part of what Jeremy Brown of Booney and one of the humble
[01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:49.270]  Or the Trinity County Board of Supervisors when we sat and discussed some of these things
[01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:52.790]  He also was just adamant about
[01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:59.750]  Tying these things together. Hey, we have to get back to getting access
[01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:04.190]  To these public funds we need to inform these people that are sitting on the hillside
[01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:12.670]  struggling fighting against fire fighting against odds fighting against bureaucracy that there are tools and people here to help and
[01:48:13.190 --> 01:48:18.510]  That's part of what this entire event is about so thanks again to everyone out there listening
[01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:22.030]  Smashing those donate buttons get out there
[01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:27.270]  Like I would say I would say nine out of ten on the farms that I saw this summer
[01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:33.030]  Especially in humble and Mendocino part of the community engagement that these people are engaged with is, you know
[01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:39.110]  Serving on their fire safe councils. They are volunteer fire department members. They fight fires. They're like on the front lines
[01:48:39.310 --> 01:48:44.590]  You know, they're out there growing but they're also out there clearing and helping their neighbors when something goes on
[01:48:44.590 --> 01:48:49.590]  So definitely really important to raise money for fire relief when it happens. It's gonna continue to happen. So
[01:48:50.110 --> 01:48:52.110]  Too well, it's out. Yeah
[01:48:52.110 --> 01:48:56.450]  And there's so many amazing items right now that are available for you
[01:48:57.030 --> 01:49:05.110]  Under market value to contribute to this cause so that's a really important piece of this is finding ways to contribute and remembering
[01:49:05.190 --> 01:49:08.530]  That so many of these community members who are involved on
[01:49:09.110 --> 01:49:15.350]  Boards and out there advocating have full nine to five jobs or more if they're farmers
[01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:19.470]  It's you know dawn to dusk jobs, but they're still finding ways
[01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:22.030]  To contribute their time and energy
[01:49:22.230 --> 01:49:28.950]  it is just absolutely baffling the amount of love and heart that these people are bringing to our communities and
[01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:33.470]  That's why I was just so blown away in our initial meeting about
[01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:40.550]  How much raft can contribute to making life just a little bit easier and bridging that gap between
[01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:43.550]  The guy who's stuck with his arms in the soil
[01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:46.430]  But yeah, he has to get in front of the computer and deal with that
[01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:49.910]  So another thing that raft did this last year is we subsidize
[01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:52.870]  regenerative trainings for farmers
[01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:54.910]  With Joey burger and regenerative boot camp
[01:49:54.910 --> 01:50:01.310]  So we we also gave about a thousand dollars in scholarships to the regenerative conference that happens to some old Southern Humboldt
[01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:03.310]  Happened for the first time in two years this year
[01:50:04.230 --> 01:50:10.990]  And you know, so I think let's see just some under four thousand dollars in the last year toward regenerative education
[01:50:11.230 --> 01:50:17.030]  And one thing that I'm really excited about coming up this next year is that I mean I can't say for sure
[01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:23.590]  But I'm pretty sure that there might be a way for these amazing regenerative farms to get paid
[01:50:24.230 --> 01:50:29.910]  For doing what they do and helping to mentor a new regenerative farmer, so I can't give details yet
[01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:32.230]  but I'm really excited about what might be coming up and I
[01:50:33.190 --> 01:50:37.110]  Yeah, I hope we can keep lifting up the people that have done it right for a long time
[01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:39.350]  intergenerationally and are
[01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:45.110]  Continuing to bring people in the community along to reduce how much they have to spend on inputs and all the things that make it
[01:50:45.190 --> 01:50:48.510]  You know harder and harder every year and margins tighter and tighter. So
[01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:57.830]  Well, that's really exciting because a couple of these folks that we're talking about Kevin Jodry who's involved in the regenerative conference
[01:50:57.830 --> 01:51:00.950]  He's gonna be on towards the end of the day. We got Joey's and George
[01:51:03.550 --> 01:51:05.550]  Yeah, Joey's gonna be on talking
[01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:07.870]  specifically about
[01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:12.710]  Regenerative farming and some of those techniques and you know while we're going over the concepts here
[01:51:12.710 --> 01:51:18.110]  They're gonna get a little more involved in exactly how to do it at home. And that's just an amazing thing. So
[01:51:19.110 --> 01:51:21.670]  We've got a lot more to come for you today. Thank you Kelly
[01:51:21.670 --> 01:51:27.110]  Until while we're on till we're on but Kelly, thank you. I actually have the clip up
[01:51:27.110 --> 01:51:30.990]  I don't know if it's the exact clip that Michael was referring to for you
[01:51:30.990 --> 01:51:36.990]  I like to close it out with that and I believe I have the clip that you are referring to
[01:51:37.630 --> 01:51:39.630]  about supervisor Brown
[01:51:42.110 --> 01:51:47.830]  Yeah, so if anybody's that watching is interested in getting connected with these regenerative farms you can just visit our website
[01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:49.830]  We have a whole list of videos
[01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:54.950]  Visit our website. We have a whole list of everybody that got certified you can find them. You can reach out to me
[01:51:54.950 --> 01:52:01.670]  I will connect you get their product in your stores. So thanks Lele. Oh, thank you. Thank you
[01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:05.030]  Here's Kelly's clip
[01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:12.950]  Stick together then we're so much stronger together like the greed and the money issue that's powerful
[01:52:13.230 --> 01:52:18.350]  But life happens across a huge spectrum. That's what Casey's like totally figured out
[01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:20.350]  Is that life is?
[01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:25.710]  Happening daily it's happening every single minute and the way you spend your time
[01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:29.190]  Matters to you and to everybody around you
[01:52:29.230 --> 01:52:35.890]  It's not just about like this goal to get the most out of every system we encounter just for what?
[01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:40.790]  We find out that it's actually not so fulfilling we find that out and then we go to yoga and we try to figure out
[01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:42.550]  Why we're not fulfilled
[01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:45.550]  And we we study yoga for a long time. And all we figure out is that
[01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:49.030]  Everything's changing all the time and that's the only thing we know
[01:52:49.670 --> 01:52:53.270]  Right. So what is there to do do something worthwhile?
[01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:59.310]  Do something that you enjoy be a part of life not just a part of making something for one goal
[01:52:59.590 --> 01:53:02.030]  You know because you miss your life like that
[01:53:04.590 --> 01:53:10.950]  All right now I have that's so beautiful Kelly you I just I appreciate you and I'm so grateful
[01:53:11.670 --> 01:53:14.190]  That that I get to play with you
[01:53:16.110 --> 01:53:18.110]  It's mutual
[01:53:18.710 --> 01:53:22.390]  Yeah, I want to give another shout out to Casey at Phoenix rising farms there
[01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:26.830]  That was on his farm right next to the little get Applegate River. So special stuff
[01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:31.590]  Okay, something happened and oh
[01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:39.590]  Man you guys are stream went fat. It just disappeared. Oh
[01:53:40.710 --> 01:53:42.710]  It won't live
[01:53:42.710 --> 01:53:44.710]  Oh
[01:53:44.710 --> 01:53:49.750]  Okay, I'm sure one two three go I know it made it seem like we were back
[01:53:50.710 --> 01:53:55.430]  My screen and see if it helps but you guys don't worry. You'll stay where you are
[01:53:56.710 --> 01:53:58.710]  It's counting again. Okay
[01:54:00.230 --> 01:54:06.790]  If we're on the screen folks donate now get on to the auction event site at
[01:54:07.590 --> 01:54:11.190]  Humboldt grace fire recovery project. There are so many amazing
[01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:17.550]  Donations that you can then donate to receive to support the farmers and people who are so affected by these
[01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:21.470]  Devastating fires that we anticipate a lot more of coming soon
[01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:26.150]  You know, we're entering one of the most
[01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:33.790]  horrific droughts we've ever experienced in Northern, California regenerative agriculture is one of the ways that we can
[01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:37.990]  Create more resilience to these droughts
[01:54:38.150 --> 01:54:41.390]  We can capture carbon we can capture water it's all about slowing
[01:54:42.110 --> 01:54:46.830]  Capturing healthy soil stores more water than soil that's depleted
[01:54:47.070 --> 01:54:51.750]  Absolutely more organic matter in the soil needs more water in the soil. It's better for everybody for sure
[01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:57.990]  Also means that they're not you know, they're using water that's caught from you know in a rain catch system instead of pulling it up
[01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:59.990]  out of a well
[01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:03.470]  There's all kinds of reasons, but I don't know how we doing on
[01:55:03.470 --> 01:55:08.350]  The clip let's see maybe we're just going out refill with the flow
[01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:14.470]  All right, let's see
[01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:20.550]  All right looks like this
[01:55:23.470 --> 01:55:29.790]  Well, I want to keep talking about that regenerative agriculture
[01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:33.790]  I'm gonna keep talking about it and I'm gonna keep talking about it and I'm gonna keep talking about it
[01:55:34.270 --> 01:55:36.950]  Well, I want to keep talking about that regenerative
[01:55:38.910 --> 01:55:41.990]  Yes, because another big part about
[01:55:43.150 --> 01:55:49.110]  Capturing water through regenerative agriculture is you create better permeability, but then water storage
[01:55:49.110 --> 01:55:52.390]  So less of the water is just running off of the surface of the soil
[01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:58.590]  Into streams and rivers where we lose the ability to capture it where it loses its ability to
[01:55:59.590 --> 01:56:02.790]  Nurture the plants and hillsides that
[01:56:03.670 --> 01:56:09.070]  Eventually feed those summer flows. We need to slow and capture so it slowly trickles through the system
[01:56:09.230 --> 01:56:14.190]  Instead of just running off the surface straight out to the ocean. We need that permeability
[01:56:14.190 --> 01:56:17.150]  We need to work together to educate each other on
[01:56:17.790 --> 01:56:24.070]  How to do this whether you're a cannabis cultivator or not. You can do these things on small scale at home
[01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:28.070]  Yeah, and tapping into this community through Sun Earth sir
[01:56:28.190 --> 01:56:32.550]  looking up the farmers in your area that are doing it and reaching out to them and
[01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:38.310]  Everybody wants to share this stuff that's involved because it's so important and hits home so well
[01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.910]  Yeah
[01:56:38.910 --> 01:56:44.790]  and I just also just recommend if you can find it if you can go out and you ask for sun-grown weed and you ask
[01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:49.470]  For regeneratively grown weed then the the retailer hears that and they're saying like, okay
[01:56:49.470 --> 01:56:52.430]  That's something that we need to support something that the consumer wants
[01:56:53.070 --> 01:56:54.590]  But it's also you know
[01:56:54.590 --> 01:57:00.710]  I've heard somebody saying something about the importance of building global community in the cannabis industry and I think that that's really cool
[01:57:00.710 --> 01:57:05.550]  I also think it's really important to build local local community, you know
[01:57:05.550 --> 01:57:11.270]  Instead of thinking really big think really small think about the very small actions that you can take
[01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:14.890]  That make something a little bit better in your surrounding system
[01:57:14.910 --> 01:57:20.350]  That's kind of what like the regenerative model is about is like being present with you know
[01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:27.950]  Your farm with your dirt with your plants or your genetics your people and so I think that's
[01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:33.030]  It's so well, so that is a great way to go into this clip
[01:57:34.110 --> 01:57:36.110]  So well said
[01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:38.510]  Awesome. Thank you
[01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:42.710]  Started at the end of July
[01:57:42.710 --> 01:57:47.430]  Michael do you want to set folks up first real quick for who we're talking to?
[01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:52.630]  Yeah, that's great so we have the lovely Lele Dubois and
[01:57:53.230 --> 01:57:56.270]  Jeremy Brown who is a Humboldt County Board of Supervisors
[01:57:59.030 --> 01:58:00.710]  Trinity County I
[01:58:00.710 --> 01:58:01.990]  Consistently do that as well
[01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:09.590]  But he's been an active member of the cultivation community from running a garden store cultivating himself for very very long time
[01:58:09.590 --> 01:58:11.270]  And he brought himself
[01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:15.070]  to the place where he got involved in politics and gave up himself to
[01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:17.470]  Contribute to the community in this way and
[01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:20.790]  We brought them into the studio here right here on the couch
[01:58:21.070 --> 01:58:27.350]  To talk about this project and the impact it was having on everyone's lives and how we can do more
[01:58:28.230 --> 01:58:31.070]  I burn through the county for I believe it was
[01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:37.190]  Started at the end of July so August all September and
[01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:43.070]  Into the beginning of October until the rains pretty much put it out
[01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:50.630]  So it was over 200,000 acres that burned in accumulation and
[01:58:52.190 --> 01:58:59.310]  You know from it was the first time I'd been in a fire in my position as a supervisor and so learning about the
[01:58:59.510 --> 01:59:01.510]  process that it takes to
[01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:10.430]  Get the resources that the local resources don't have into the county and into the communities
[01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:12.510]  While there's an active fire moving
[01:59:13.110 --> 01:59:19.430]  it's it's really challenging because it's this moving target and you have all these variables and
[01:59:19.950 --> 01:59:26.430]  Once they exceed the capacity for local resources like your volunteer fire departments
[01:59:27.710 --> 01:59:31.510]  and since Trinity County, you know, all we have is the
[01:59:32.230 --> 01:59:36.790]  We reveal fire department and the volunteer fire department. So downriver
[01:59:36.910 --> 01:59:41.070]  Hawkins bar and Sawyer and then Willow Creek, which is in Humboldt County
[01:59:41.070 --> 01:59:45.950]  Those are all volunteers. Those are your first responders are the volunteers and
[01:59:46.670 --> 01:59:48.670]  And then you have your Forest Service
[01:59:50.110 --> 01:59:52.110]  Stations and those usually have
[01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:59.910]  You know one or two fire trucks and a team of maybe four to six eight people that are usually
[02:00:01.670 --> 02:00:03.670]  Positioned there year-round I believe
[02:00:03.670 --> 02:00:06.390]  And so when a fire exceeds a certain capacity
[02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:09.870]  they request outside resources and
[02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:17.470]  From the moment you make those requests until those resources are actually boots on the ground in the county
[02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:19.470]  You know that might be
[02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:21.470]  You know two days three days
[02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:26.190]  It depends what other activities are going on in the rest of the state
[02:00:26.190 --> 02:00:30.030]  And so with this year with the Dixie fire going on
[02:00:30.030 --> 02:00:35.150]  So many resources were already allocated to that that takes a while to shift it and
[02:00:35.710 --> 02:00:42.670]  And so when you have those, you know, three or four days of transferring the resources a lot can happen with the fire
[02:00:42.670 --> 02:00:44.670]  So it makes these these
[02:00:45.230 --> 02:00:47.230]  resource requests, you know
[02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:51.790]  Really hard to totally target for the entire fire department
[02:00:51.790 --> 02:00:54.270]  So we have to be very careful about that
[02:00:54.270 --> 02:00:56.270]  And I think that
[02:00:56.270 --> 02:01:00.950]  You know that is really challenging and the people that have to make those decisions
[02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:04.150]  I imagine their positions being very challenging to
[02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:12.910]  You're trying to predict the weather and you're looking at the community densities where you know, where are the most affected areas where?
[02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:16.030]  You know, you can't help everyone in those situations
[02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:19.030]  So I think that's a big part of the challenge
[02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:22.110]  You know, you can't help everyone in those situations and
[02:01:23.150 --> 02:01:25.150]  one of the things I realized was, you know,
[02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:31.710]  Like everyone moved back into these areas, you know to kind of be left alone
[02:01:31.710 --> 02:01:35.430]  that was a lot of the basis of the back to the land movement or
[02:01:36.270 --> 02:01:41.710]  veterans coming out of war or people coming out to you know, mine gold and
[02:01:41.710 --> 02:01:48.790]  Ranch all that to get away from the cities and to get away from you know, government control and oversight and
[02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:54.870]  and when these these disasters come through whether it's a fire or
[02:01:56.870 --> 02:02:03.550]  Other disasters are mostly slides slides are pretty impact. Yeah, we we do depend in a lot of ways on outside resources
[02:02:03.550 --> 02:02:07.070]  So it makes it challenging and there's definitely a challenge
[02:02:07.070 --> 02:02:13.550]  You know, there's some people that are are totally self-dependent where they're not going to count on for service or
[02:02:14.150 --> 02:02:18.510]  Cal fire whoever to come and protect them. They're gonna stay there and depend their own place
[02:02:18.910 --> 02:02:23.670]  There's a certain aspect of that, but there is also a shift that I think I've seen
[02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:26.230]  people that
[02:02:26.230 --> 02:02:30.710]  You know, I want to be left alone. I don't want to depend on government control
[02:02:30.710 --> 02:02:34.510]  I want to be left alone and I want to be able to do my own thing
[02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:40.910]  I don't want to depend on government assistance, but now some of these events are very extreme and
[02:02:41.590 --> 02:02:43.750]  whether it's climate change or
[02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:47.070]  forest management practices
[02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:53.190]  Whatever. The reason is the flames can move faster and in a rural area
[02:02:53.950 --> 02:02:58.390]  You don't have the communications of that urban area
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:09.880]  We back we're back
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:11.440]  Back
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:14.160]  Awesome. Yeah, so that was really an
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:20.320]  amazing time for me to hear some of the perspective from Jeremy somebody who's lived through it on
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:23.680]  both sides of the coin so to speak somebody who's you know,
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:30.400]  just been in the community trying to deal with it as a civilian and then somebody who's actually trying to facilitate these
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:38.400]  programs in real time and you could see and especially we discussed some of it after the cameras stopped like
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:43.800]  How profoundly deeply he felt the duty to bring these
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:49.040]  Benefits to the people and to try and educate people on how to be more fire resilient
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:55.120]  Use the tools available to bounce back to find ways to navigate the bureaucracy for funding
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:59.960]  for grants and to use them to their advantage and you know, I think that's
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  Potentially something that we see
[02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:05.600]  Raph kind of merge into
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:08.000]  Supporting in the future, you know
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:13.400]  I see these programs as growing and not slowing as the community needs them and
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:16.000]  Finds them and finds ways to support them. I
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:20.600]  Agree I think now that we're out of the closet
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:27.120]  We can take all our smart strategies and activisms to the to the general public as well
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:35.320]  Not just the plant but all these amazing tools that we've used to build and survive without all that external support
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:39.600]  You know, I I really think we have a lot to share
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:46.560]  All right. Where are we on the schedule? I think we have
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:53.160]  Sequoia coming up next we are shockingly on time. So I look forward to what's next
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:05:00.400]  All right, we are on time aren't we wow, that is really cool good job everybody
[02:05:03.240 --> 02:05:05.240]  Thanks for joining us
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:13.480]  We're gonna smoke for rain, I'm gonna run home and then I'm gonna try to get back. Okay, right on cuz I'll be over there smoking
[02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:23.000]  I'll smoke somewhere for sure. Okay, sounds good. I'm gonna pull Adelia up and we'll see you soon Michael
[02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:29.120]  Hi, Adelia. How was lunch? Hi. Oh, I'm waiting. I think it just got here actually
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:33.100]  So after this, I'll sneak and eat really quick
[02:05:33.940 --> 02:05:38.700]  Sequoia and I we're gonna go out out after this. I'm having a cocktail I think
[02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:41.740]  Let's go
[02:05:41.820 --> 02:05:49.500]  I'm really excited this woman Sequoia Hudson Adelia. If you don't mind I'd like to give her a little intro
[02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:54.020]  Have been playing together
[02:05:55.300 --> 02:06:00.540]  Since this community started talking about legalization. We were on a board together and
[02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:03.180]  This woman is
[02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:07.040]  So tough and really
[02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:14.040]  Dives in and figures it out and and pushes for the solutions
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:18.580]  and I just have really appreciated having you as a sister in this and
[02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:25.060]  Getting to be a part of you in this and her father. She has she's a second generation
[02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:27.860]  Or is it further back than that
[02:06:29.860 --> 02:06:34.740]  My parents actually didn't have in direct involvement in cultivating cannabis my
[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:40.500]  Relationship with cannabis through some of his invention
[02:06:41.540 --> 02:06:44.580]  and he was a very white and
[02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:49.380]  invented a lot of the tools that a lot of the cannabis growers use
[02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:54.420]  Indirectly supported the industry he actually because of the the tools he brought
[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:57.380]  the
[02:06:57.380 --> 02:06:59.380]  He invented the first
[02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:05.780]  He invented the Sun Circle, which was the indoor mechanism that rotated lights within doors
[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:10.340]  He was an inventor of some of the newer technology with the NFL
[02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:14.740]  So he was a very innovative inventor and he was a very innovative
[02:07:15.300 --> 02:07:20.380]  Was an inventor of some of the newer technology with the NFT systems
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:23.540]  like better systems that
[02:07:23.780 --> 02:07:30.180]  We see lettuce and vegetables in that they will don't they have agriculture because of the durability and the hydro ability
[02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:32.820]  but enough about that he
[02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:39.820]  Indirectly supported the industry and I definitely he is definitely what brought me to Humboldt County because he was in Humboldt County doing that
[02:07:40.220 --> 02:07:46.620]  All through my youth and I would come up and visit and connected and eventually as an adult set roots here and
[02:07:47.500 --> 02:07:52.700]  Never look back. And so I've been in the community for a really long time both growing up
[02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:56.380]  but for 30 years solid as an adult and just
[02:07:57.900 --> 02:07:59.900]  Connected with the people here. Yeah
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:07.660]  Well, so I have a question, you know, we hear all the stories, you know all over the news in media online
[02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:13.180]  But we are only painted a somewhat of a picture of what it what it might be
[02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:15.140]  Can you share with us?
[02:08:15.140 --> 02:08:22.540]  What it real what it is really like with cannabis legalization and the impact it is having on the legacy communities
[02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:24.540]  in the Emerald Triangle
[02:08:26.060 --> 02:08:30.540]  You know, there's so many things there it's so deep and so convoluted
[02:08:30.540 --> 02:08:35.240]  I think that the hugest impact is really that a lot of the legacy farmers
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:41.640]  They had their businesses on their mountains and their spots and they were already caring for the earth and doing things in their way that made
[02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:45.480]  sense for them they could adapt as necessary to the weather and to
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:48.200]  Pass into life that was impacting them
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:51.240]  Because they were on their own schedule in their own terms
[02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:56.840]  It wasn't you know, there wasn't a lot of regulatory stuff any regulatory stuff really that was intruding on
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:59.720]  them farming as farmers
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:02.680]  and and now it's like being able to
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:09.080]  To bring what is being expected of them into their home place into their businesses that were already working
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:14.520]  Even the supply chain, you know, it already worked and many will say that oh, well
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:18.360]  They weren't paying taxes or they weren't contributing to the community or all these things
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:23.480]  They were doing those things the legacy farmers were and still are as much as they can
[02:09:47.340 --> 02:09:51.020]  Several generations for decades was because of the
[02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:56.380]  Legacy farmers that contribute to their community always because it was the right thing to do and it was where they live
[02:09:57.980 --> 02:10:04.780]  Wow, thank you for sharing that. Do you want me to go to my next question? Lele? Yes, please
[02:10:06.700 --> 02:10:12.460]  Because you know, I I I I I have my perspective right but I know so quick
[02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:16.940]  So I think what's gonna what's fascinating is is because this is streaming all over
[02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:21.680]  You know your what would you like to hear from from Sequoia
[02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:26.140]  Well, so my next question I had was you know
[02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:32.540]  How can our our brothers and sisters that are tuning in, you know, whether they're from norcal
[02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:36.240]  But or more importantly from these other states or or communities
[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:40.780]  Help make change so we can keep our legacy communities alive
[02:10:41.340 --> 02:10:46.140]  Um, and then after that, why is it important that we all come together at this time?
[02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:52.880]  Sure. Well, one of the things that really got me involved early on in policy and politics
[02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:55.400]  in cannabis was really
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:11:01.900]  realizing that there was so much developing and there wasn't a lot of input their understanding of the nexus of
[02:11:02.700 --> 02:11:05.600]  of traditional business and traditional cannabis
[02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:10.380]  And being able to understand how they can merge and start working together
[02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:14.540]  and so recognizing that there was a lot of rules coming down the pipe that
[02:11:15.180 --> 02:11:17.180]  Wouldn't be civil if it didn't work
[02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:22.940]  Seeing that there was things that didn't connect because I understood how business worked and I understood how cannabis worked
[02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:29.900]  and and it that's really been one of the huge problems through the regulatory development was how
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.180]  regulations were developing and they
[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:36.300]  Wow, okay
[02:11:36.860 --> 02:11:41.660]  Um, and and I saw a lot of places where they wouldn't work and they didn't connect
[02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:49.740]  And so getting involved in the in the development of the regulations was super important and it still is super important because there's a lot of
[02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:57.120]  Fixing that still needs to be done. And there's a lot of you know, we're also looking at development on the federal level of regulations
[02:11:57.900 --> 02:11:59.900]  and unfortunately like
[02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:05.500]  The politics and the policy is not where a lot of the farmers are best at among other things
[02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:10.380]  But you know, they're good at farming and so they have to be in tune with what's developing is really hard
[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:13.900]  And you know, luckily we have had a huge
[02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:21.100]  community of advocates and people that have been stepping forward and you know, there's people there's so many that are
[02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:24.860]  Fighting for patient access and people access which is super important
[02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:29.100]  There are a lot of people but not enough like fighting for the legacy farms
[02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:34.460]  It's going to be really ashamed to see a lot of the farms go away because they can't
[02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:37.180]  Follow the regulatory structure
[02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:39.820]  um, I think that um
[02:12:40.860 --> 02:12:44.620]  It's just it's super important to tune in with what's happening to the small farms
[02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:48.540]  You know, we're going to lose a lot of them through this and it's unfortunate for some of the reasons
[02:12:48.540 --> 02:12:53.660]  I mentioned earlier not being able to be sustainable not being able to contribute back to their community in the ways
[02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:55.740]  I see the community struggling
[02:12:55.740 --> 02:13:00.140]  um for even you know mental health issues a lot of them are struggling with identity and
[02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:03.260]  and who they were and who they are like
[02:13:03.980 --> 02:13:05.100]  They know who they are
[02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:10.880]  But they're struggling because they're not able to function in the ways that they have traditionally been able to like adjusting and evolving
[02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:17.900]  And have and you know, there's a lot of people that have been growing cannabis for even 10, but 20 30 40 years
[02:13:18.380 --> 02:13:19.740]  That's what they know
[02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:23.260]  and that's what they've been doing and a lot has changed in those decades to where
[02:13:23.820 --> 02:13:27.680]  There aren't a lot of opportunities for them to still be productive
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:33.180]  Contributors to commerce in the community and a lot of them are of retirement age
[02:13:33.900 --> 02:13:35.900]  Um or even beyond
[02:13:36.700 --> 02:13:37.980]  Do you feel
[02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:39.500]  I'm, sorry. Go ahead
[02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:43.980]  No, I was just going to ask you there was a couple parts to your question that I was answering about like how people need
[02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:45.980]  to get involved
[02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:47.500]  So go ahead
[02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:53.420]  Yeah, um, no, so I was going to say, you know with the with the changes that are starting to come from california
[02:13:53.580 --> 02:13:57.180]  You know regulation and they're they're making changes and drafts. Do you think?
[02:13:58.060 --> 02:14:02.300]  It's quick enough. Do you think those those changes are going to do?
[02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:08.300]  I mean they will help but is it quick enough? Like do we need to do even more? Would you would you say that?
[02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:11.020]  No, I don't think it's quick enough
[02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:16.000]  Another thing I want to bring up really quick that kind of ties into that too is like another huge problem with the regulations
[02:14:16.780 --> 02:14:20.480]  For the small farms is that they're so used to being able to do things for themselves
[02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:25.500]  they're used to be able to like, you know, go take some product to the lab or to
[02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:31.440]  You know, whatever their distributor is or even to manufacturing for their processing or for packaging
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.040]  And something as simple as like not being able to get a transfer now
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:38.240]  I have a transport only license to transport your herb off the farm
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:41.680]  You can't just take it off the farm because you have a cultivation license
[02:14:42.160 --> 02:14:47.200]  And and being able to attain that license they now they have made it easier and easier and they've been listening
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:51.600]  But it's still there like we still have to get this separate license that costs more money
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:54.320]  and if they don't have it we have to
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:59.920]  Pay a distributor to come pick up the product whereas normally they could just put it in their truck and take it to town
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:01.280]  And use their own time
[02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:01.920]  and so it's like
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:02.620]  you know
[02:15:02.620 --> 02:15:05.200]  $650 for some of these farms that are way out in the hills to
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:11.440]  Just deliver a load of stuff to town that they normally would probably take when they went to the grocery store that week or something
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  and so not being able to really just
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:19.600]  Our farmers are super resilient, but also very um, they're problem solvers
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:24.640]  That's how they live rurally is they know how to fix problems on their farm and even with their businesses
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:29.840]  They know how to find solutions and when you're restricted and inhibited because of the regulations and what?
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:35.680]  The regulations are saying are wrong or right? It's really difficult because you want to do the right thing, but you know
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:43.200]  Both logistically and financially it doesn't work and it's not that you're going to do anything wrong, but it just doesn't work
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:50.080]  Now I appreciate that you even went into detail of the process because I know some people are tuning in that you know
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:53.940]  Have no idea what what the process is like and and in california
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:55.740]  they've
[02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:58.480]  incorporated so many regulations that it's just
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:02.800]  You there's too much that you're thinking of and like you said they now have to you know
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:06.480]  Instead of them just dropping it, you know dropping it off when they're going to get groceries
[02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:10.160]  Now they have to think of all these other things and bring somebody to come to them and all that
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:13.040]  So I I think that's a great breakdown of it
[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:16.800]  and and so the other part to that first question that I was saying is um
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:21.440]  You know, why is it important that we all come together at this time?
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:27.200]  So again the ones that are not from uh, maybe not from norcal, you know, how can they how can they help?
[02:16:27.440 --> 02:16:28.240]  What what is there?
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:32.880]  Is there a what what is the best way for them to do if they they do want to support?
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:36.480]  and they not necessarily can support from you know, or by
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:42.640]  Supporting their business by ordering from the dispensaries to buy their product. Are there other ways that they can get involved from other states?
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:48.800]  There's so many ways to support and get involved. It really does depend on where you are what you're able to do
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:52.820]  Um, you know education is super huge normalizing the conversation
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:59.920]  Being able to talk to people and give them accurate information when they're asking questions and not make it seem so taboo
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:01.500]  um
[02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:08.240]  Definitely when you're in any state but in california, obviously, you know when you go into the dispensaries knowing, you know
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:14.560]  We have this hashtag know your farmer know who your farmer is and when you're going into a dispensary like ask for that farmer
[02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:20.880]  Um specifically i'm going to say look for sun grown, you know, we are a strong sun grown farmer
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:23.120]  a group and
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:29.540]  Um sun grown doesn't get enough credit and a lot of people don't even know what to ask for or know how to identify
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:34.960]  um, you know different aspects of cannabis whether it be a concentrate or a flower or whatever but
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:37.920]  When you go into the dispensary ask them for sun grown flower
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:43.280]  Sometimes, you know, we've had experiences where you go in the dispensary and ask and they don't even know
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:47.280]  Or they say that they don't have it and yet you see it right there on the shelf
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:52.400]  And so, you know the fact that the bud tenders don't know that's a huge thing
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:55.040]  We know needs to happen is educating the bud tenders
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:18:00.880]  But yeah going into the dispensaries asking for sun grown maybe asking about the farms. I feel like the more
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:04.960]  customers are going into dispensaries and asking questions and
[02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:10.800]  Hopefully leading bud tenders and dispensary owners to get more information to provide them
[02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:15.200]  As the people become more educated and ask the questions that they need to have answers for
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:17.120]  um
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:20.000]  Definitely on a policy level, you know something
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:24.320]  politics I call all the tricks because oftentimes there's
[02:18:24.940 --> 02:18:31.360]  regulations developing and you know, it's all a give and take and push and pull and making in negotiations and so there's stuff that's
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:36.240]  being put in some of this stuff that you don't even realize because they're selling it with some
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:39.680]  Tagline or something that is appealing to you as a voter
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.360]  but it doesn't necessarily tell you the whole story about what you're voting for so like really
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:49.520]  look into what you're voting on when you're voting for and and understand it I think you know register to vote and
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:52.080]  and and be a voter and and
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:58.240]  But but know what you're voting on for sure. I think there's a lot of things that are out there that are
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:01.440]  Marketed
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:04.480]  At face value, but not really telling the story
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:10.080]  So do the research ask the questions to do the research ask questions, yeah
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:12.400]  Well, you know, uh, you know
[02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:13.360]  Thank you for your time
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:17.600]  Is there any other final words you'd like to share to our community or even about this auction?
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:21.760]  How how did you take a look at it and any items that were peaking towards your interest?
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:27.040]  I haven't got to yet. I was kind of gonna wait till after my turn came so that I didn't have to worry about getting
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:29.120]  too lost in the in the
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:34.080]  And get distracted, but i'm going to take a look after we get off here
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:36.640]  um final words
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:39.200]  um, I would like to say that um
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:46.080]  I think just speaking to like the situation of the fires i'd like to talk about for a minute because we definitely were impacted by the
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:48.080]  fires, you know that
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:51.600]  What is crazy to think about and I want to point out to some people is that?
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:55.760]  Not everyone impacted by the fires was directly in the fires
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:59.840]  We have a farm that was you know a few miles away from the fires
[02:19:59.920 --> 02:20:06.400]  But our herb was impacted because of the smoke that lingered for days and weeks and even months on end
[02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:10.400]  You know, there was lack of oxygen lack of light and then the herb smells like smoke
[02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:17.520]  And so even even five even farms that weren't necessarily directly impacted by fire and flames and burning
[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:20.400]  There was a it's a significant thing
[02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:26.900]  Um, the marketplace is already rough right now and to have a crop loss like that and not have any kind of insurance
[02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:30.240]  um, there's a lot of things that farmers are dealing with
[02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:32.960]  and um, so definitely
[02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:37.380]  Hashtag know your farmer look for small farm product in the dispensaries
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:40.480]  And when you go in and support sun grown for sure
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.240]  Great no, thank you for sharing that that is a good point
[02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:48.480]  And and sharing your story on that and how it did affect you as well and your farm
[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:51.360]  Lele welcome back
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:53.360]  Hi ladies
[02:20:53.360 --> 02:21:01.040]  We were having technical difficulties, but we're good. Thank goodness for the future cannabis product
[02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:03.040]  They're still streaming on their
[02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:14.240]  Their thing on share it everywhere if you guys there go to the future cannabis youtube
[02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:19.600]  That's where we're streaming live right now and if everyone could share it on their networks
[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:23.360]  That would be great
[02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:24.960]  and we
[02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:27.460]  Can dive in I think we got michael
[02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:30.800]  and dale and
[02:21:31.680 --> 02:21:33.680]  up next
[02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:39.760]  I a brief little another community video while we're bringing dale
[02:21:39.840 --> 02:21:42.160]  Up on the screen. Thanks ladies. Thanks
[02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:59.940]  Shit show from state to state. There's no uniformity even from county to county or municipality to municipality
[02:22:00.480 --> 02:22:06.480]  Everybody's seen dollars. It's so different than what happened with alcohol prohibition where totally it was just lifted across the board
[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:10.400]  And it opened up business to kind of operate pretty much the same, you know
[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:15.120]  Unless there were certain areas that were not allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:17.760]  So it was pretty much the same, you know, unless there were certain areas
[02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:22.820]  Maybe you could be open on a sunday, but pretty fucking minor when you're looking at it in comparison to cannabis
[02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000]  Hey dale
[02:22:35.350 --> 02:22:37.350]  All right, hi michael
[02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:40.070]  Hello, I can't hear you dale
[02:22:43.950 --> 02:22:46.750]  I think I got this all fixed. Can you see and hear me? Okay
[02:22:46.830 --> 02:22:48.830]  Yeah
[02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:53.470]  We can see and hear you where in the part of the world are you
[02:22:56.740 --> 02:23:01.060]  Then um the middle of utah headed towards
[02:23:02.420 --> 02:23:04.420]  vegas after visiting
[02:23:05.140 --> 02:23:06.500]  utah
[02:23:06.500 --> 02:23:07.940]  and
[02:23:07.940 --> 02:23:12.020]  It was trying to snow. I've got snow on my car. No snow on the ground right now. Anyway
[02:23:13.620 --> 02:23:15.620]  I'm in my car a lot as you already saw
[02:23:16.340 --> 02:23:18.340]  More than once
[02:23:18.980 --> 02:23:22.020]  You're pulled over right because we need you. Yeah
[02:23:23.060 --> 02:23:26.260]  I signal in a good exit. So here I am perfect. Perfect. Well, I
[02:23:26.900 --> 02:23:30.980]  I make i'm thank you for taking time to come out. I was hoping kelsey was
[02:23:31.620 --> 02:23:36.340]  In it beyond that her her range where that isn't working well enough
[02:23:36.900 --> 02:23:43.220]  um, so i'm just gonna hang out i'd like you to meet my friend michael back he is a part of
[02:23:43.780 --> 02:23:48.520]  Royal gold and maybe we can make that happen when we do our event on the 29th
[02:23:52.340 --> 02:23:54.340]  Sounds good
[02:23:54.580 --> 02:24:01.220]  Yeah, yeah dale is a part of our and said lele let me be your pro bono
[02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:05.460]  Attorney and let's get this
[02:24:05.940 --> 02:24:08.980]  Done and I swear after that
[02:24:09.220 --> 02:24:14.340]  After that and everybody got lit and it was like woo and things started
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:17.780]  happening
[02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:22.980]  Thank you. Dale. Um, my and and is a is
[02:24:23.860 --> 02:24:27.860]  a plant scientist as well as an ip attorney and
[02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:32.100]  Folks in the
[02:24:32.900 --> 02:24:37.220]  Sea and in our plants and protect their genetic
[02:24:37.700 --> 02:24:41.220]  Um, thanks for joining us dale michael i'll let you take over lovely
[02:24:41.620 --> 02:24:46.660]  Thank you. This is a really exciting opportunity for you because the subject matter is
[02:24:47.220 --> 02:24:49.940]  You know so near and dear to my heart and it's you know
[02:24:51.120 --> 02:24:56.020]  protecting genetics protecting the people with those genetics and
[02:24:57.060 --> 02:25:00.660]  The legacy farmers and a way to move forward
[02:25:02.820 --> 02:25:06.180]  Value is properly assigned and it's really
[02:25:07.780 --> 02:25:09.780]  A
[02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:11.940]  Important thing i've talked to a few people
[02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:17.460]  In varying role humble grace legacy project and so i'm really
[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:23.380]  Excited to hear what you have to say and I know a lot of them are probably not very
[02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:27.380]  And how it's going to preserve those genetic and the value
[02:25:32.650 --> 02:25:36.170]  Well, lele might be the better people in humble
[02:25:36.970 --> 02:25:40.810]  Will have been oh, do you want to do you want to jump in lately and take a shot at that?
[02:25:41.130 --> 02:25:44.170]  well, I was I was I was laughing that I I
[02:25:45.850 --> 02:25:51.770]  I didn't I I wasn't expecting the question, but I would love to hear what you have to
[02:25:52.650 --> 02:25:53.770]  say
[02:25:53.770 --> 02:25:55.770]  Okay, i'll take a shot at it. So
[02:25:56.410 --> 02:26:03.210]  um, we all know that that the humble area the the emerald triangle area has been
[02:26:04.010 --> 02:26:10.010]  The capital of cannabis breeding decades and in many cases they they're able to bring
[02:26:11.050 --> 02:26:12.490]  and
[02:26:12.490 --> 02:26:13.450]  some
[02:26:13.450 --> 02:26:16.410]  Great genetics from land races from around the world
[02:26:17.210 --> 02:26:19.850]  but also in in many cases people have been
[02:26:20.410 --> 02:26:22.490]  was available to breed with and so
[02:26:23.370 --> 02:26:28.190]  We we know that there's a great diversity of strains or cultivars
[02:26:28.970 --> 02:26:31.530]  There's some genetic diversity, but there's a lot more genetic
[02:26:32.410 --> 02:26:39.130]  House and it's not really available for for breeding
[02:26:40.010 --> 02:26:45.130]  um and for widespread breeding, so there's an article I wrote in the
[02:26:47.930 --> 02:26:50.890]  Cannabis business times I don't I can't give you the exact reference
[02:26:51.610 --> 02:26:58.330]  Anybody google's my name and that i'll be able to find commercial cannabis and the lack of it. So
[02:26:59.210 --> 02:27:02.650]  I think that one of the benefits that that we get from
[02:27:03.530 --> 02:27:09.550]  Supporting the foundation and supporting this effort is to to help with the viability with the long-term viability
[02:27:10.090 --> 02:27:12.110]  Of readers that have these great collections
[02:27:12.730 --> 02:27:16.410]  And the way that they can share their genetics without losing control
[02:27:17.610 --> 02:27:21.770]  Control of it. I know a lot of people I really want to put my stuff out there
[02:27:21.850 --> 02:27:24.810]  But as soon as I do i'm going to lose control of it. I'm going to
[02:27:25.770 --> 02:27:29.530]  Get ripped off other people are going to be mad at me with it and I won't be able to
[02:27:30.090 --> 02:27:33.210]  And i've heard it a thousand times part of my work is helping
[02:27:33.770 --> 02:27:36.430]  To protect people's control over their genetics
[02:27:36.970 --> 02:27:43.530]  Um, i'm a patent attorney. Sometimes a patent is the right approach. It's not always the right approach. I work a lot. I
[02:27:44.890 --> 02:27:46.890]  support whatever
[02:27:48.150 --> 02:27:52.170]  Solution breeders want to adopt and I try to help them
[02:27:52.810 --> 02:27:55.370]  Uh identify its strengths and weaknesses so
[02:27:55.930 --> 02:28:01.690]  um, I do believe that as we all support this we just help that nucleus of
[02:28:02.250 --> 02:28:03.850]  I think the back
[02:28:03.850 --> 02:28:06.970]  backbone of the breeder community in the triangle to
[02:28:07.610 --> 02:28:09.850]  live on and fight another day and and
[02:28:11.930 --> 02:28:13.930]  I think that's amazing because
[02:28:16.330 --> 02:28:18.250]  It's so true
[02:28:18.250 --> 02:28:25.390]  You share a seed share a clone it can take on a life of its own and the thing that you protected so vigilantly
[02:28:26.250 --> 02:28:29.610]  Then you lose control over any profitability and there are people out there
[02:28:30.090 --> 02:28:34.270]  Making tons of money off of a lot of your work and you have no recourse
[02:28:34.810 --> 02:28:37.930]  And it discourages people up here from sharing
[02:28:38.490 --> 02:28:41.370]  The bounty of genetics that have been amassed over the last
[02:28:41.930 --> 02:28:43.690]  60 plus years
[02:28:43.690 --> 02:28:46.730]  coming from all over the world to cultivation, so
[02:28:47.370 --> 02:28:55.210]  Yeah, how can we get protection properly to encourage the sharing I think is kind of the crux of the issue here then right
[02:28:57.690 --> 02:28:59.690]  Here a hammer everything looks like
[02:28:59.930 --> 02:29:05.050]  Nail i'm a patent attorney. And so I I see the solution in patents a lot
[02:29:05.690 --> 02:29:09.530]  but I try not to be single-minded about that there are other approaches, but
[02:29:10.250 --> 02:29:13.370]  the the one thing I would say about patents is that
[02:29:13.850 --> 02:29:17.450]  um, if you have if if you have a patent
[02:29:18.250 --> 02:29:19.050]  and
[02:29:19.050 --> 02:29:25.610]  Your genetics slip away because somebody that you trusted either tried to rip you off or maybe they gave it their best shot at keeping
[02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:27.690]  control of it, but some
[02:29:27.690 --> 02:29:31.210]  Of it slipped out a pet you need to either stop growing it or you need to be
[02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:37.120]  Become legitimate
[02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:44.880]  Sign up with a license for a license to our patent and then you can keep growing it and what's what's cool about this and
[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:47.440]  With any solution that helps a breeder
[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:50.320]  protect their eggs and keep
[02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:55.320]  is that
[02:29:55.320 --> 02:29:57.320]  A lot of people that's a bit of patent limits
[02:29:57.960 --> 02:29:59.960]  um
[02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:02.920]  Flowers and blueberries and things like that
[02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:11.240]  When you have when you can protect your genetics while putting it out there it really increases access
[02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:14.600]  It makes it so that yeah, I can put this all around the world
[02:30:14.680 --> 02:30:18.840]  I can let the whole world benefit from the work I have collection
[02:30:19.480 --> 02:30:20.680]  and
[02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:22.360]  I won't get ripped off
[02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:24.360]  You can still be too
[02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:26.680]  in c access
[02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:32.360]  Without losing so that's that's kind of my my thing. That's the contribution. I try to this
[02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:34.920]  um to this group and uh
[02:30:35.880 --> 02:30:38.120]  um, it's kind of through education as well as
[02:30:38.740 --> 02:30:39.720]  providing
[02:30:39.720 --> 02:30:44.780]  Providing legal support when it when it's one other thing i'll just mention if people have more questions
[02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:50.140]  I have a blog that answers a lot of these questions. It's plant lot.com
[02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:54.760]  So i'll just throw that out there in case anybody wants to read more
[02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:58.920]  I certainly do and you know what you were just saying there about other people's
[02:30:59.700 --> 02:31:03.320]  Patenting of you know grapes and other genetics. You see it all the time in seed
[02:31:04.180 --> 02:31:05.160]  catalogs
[02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:07.720]  Oh patented michigan state university patented
[02:31:08.200 --> 02:31:12.360]  Where wherever where they develop these genetics, but it's not stock product
[02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:16.040]  um, you know, i've got michigan state developed blueberry
[02:31:16.680 --> 02:31:18.120]  plant and
[02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:21.000]  And you know, nobody's coming after me
[02:31:21.800 --> 02:31:25.160]  To pay them for that but also not out there selling it
[02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:27.160]  so
[02:31:27.160 --> 02:31:29.160]  That's kind of the balance that
[02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:35.480]  Cannabis farmers need to strike I guess is where it's available and out there but yet the homage
[02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:41.400]  It gets paid to the work correct is a really good example
[02:31:43.880 --> 02:31:45.880]  I think that
[02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:48.040]  Another thing that
[02:31:48.040 --> 02:31:52.280]  Isn't all there is you can patent something as a patent. No, you can say yeah
[02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:56.680]  I'm granting a universal homegrown license if you're growing this for yourself
[02:31:57.080 --> 02:32:02.440]  Knock it if you're a big-ass farm. Sorry if you're a big farm and you're going to grow many acres
[02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:04.600]  to this
[02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:09.000]  Then yeah, you need to write and you need to get my permission to do that. And so
[02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:12.940]  the the thing about does have some legal recourse
[02:32:14.600 --> 02:32:21.320]  Over their genetics is they can decide how to use that legal recourse and I really I promote encourage
[02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:23.560]  work with
[02:32:23.560 --> 02:32:27.960]  To go and a homegrown license. We're not trying to push people out of their make
[02:32:28.440 --> 02:32:31.000]  That's not how a breeder is going to make a lot of money anyway
[02:32:31.960 --> 02:32:35.400]  And it's really giving back and it's a way to let people
[02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:41.480]  Enjoy the plant but there there is going to be we all know they're going to be a lot of big companies
[02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:43.800]  That want to grow great
[02:32:44.260 --> 02:32:46.920]  Genetics they're going to come in
[02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:49.960]  Do it either
[02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:53.080]  Around by somebody
[02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:56.120]  But
[02:32:56.120 --> 02:32:57.720]  Because there are some
[02:32:57.720 --> 02:33:00.840]  Some big companies that are going to be doing this and we can't stop them
[02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:07.320]  I just will make it so that the bears in the emerald triangle can take advantage of working with with those
[02:33:08.900 --> 02:33:12.040]  Opportunities and actually get paid for their life's work
[02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:15.720]  One thing you can say well
[02:33:16.280 --> 02:33:19.160]  Why is it even ethical to patent a plant?
[02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:21.240]  and
[02:33:21.240 --> 02:33:25.400]  Question I get asked a lot, you know, if you're a recording artist or
[02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:31.880]  Or you make a movie you've got copyright protection and so you can put your art out there
[02:33:31.960 --> 02:33:34.520]  You can get them to write you a check. There is no
[02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:38.840]  Such thing as that automatic protection
[02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:40.440]  for
[02:33:40.440 --> 02:33:43.560]  plant varieties or for the work of a breeder and so
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:49.400]  The ethics really of patenting a plant is that you get the same kind of protection that an artist
[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:51.960]  Or maybe you just enforce it against people who
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:53.800]  are
[02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:55.640]  using it in a way
[02:33:55.640 --> 02:33:58.200]  that you wouldn't want them to or or who are making a
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:01.240]  Lot of money and you get them to write you a check
[02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:08.120]  so it really is a way of kind of leveling the playing field between the creative work of plant breeders and
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:11.160]  that that's so
[02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:14.440]  Eye-opening and it's not just a synced
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:19.240]  Way to describe it and helpful for me to understand it and I love
[02:34:19.880 --> 02:34:24.120]  That you're advocating for you know, publicly used homegrown
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:29.720]  Privileges and that's how people develop a name for these genetics that can
[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:34.760]  Create the value as well. So I think it's a value to the farmer
[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:38.120]  To allow them to spy a commercial market in
[02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:41.320]  any effective way but
[02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:45.400]  Great hype they create enough into the market that allows people to
[02:34:46.200 --> 02:34:50.520]  Hear what to find. So I I love that advocacy for
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:53.560]  supporting the small farmer but
[02:34:54.200 --> 02:34:56.200]  acting the value
[02:34:56.200 --> 02:34:58.200]  man, amazing work
[02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:03.960]  Learn more about this blockchain and i've been talking to more and more people from the canopy right group and
[02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:09.320]  Yeah, and i'm i'm excited that you guys
[02:35:09.720 --> 02:35:11.720]  Yeah, and i'm i'm excited that you guys
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:14.280]  are going to be talking later to
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:17.880]  um the people from the ethical data alliance, it's another way of bringing blockchain
[02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:19.640]  to this that
[02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:21.880]  um, that's a group that i'm really proud to be
[02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:26.680]  Well, thank you so much
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:36.120]  They yeah the ethical data alliance is really I stepped into their space
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:40.200]  And they really are doing are very
[02:35:41.060 --> 02:35:43.060]  Dimensional
[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:50.760]  Align with what we were doing and and it's really I met dale before but it's really where I talked about started talking about
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.200]  the vision
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:54.200]  and it was like
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:35:57.320]  All all the pieces
[02:35:57.800 --> 02:36:01.160]  Came into place. That's when jeffrey came to me with canopy, right?
[02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:05.660]  And you know all the people are like all your relationships your relationship
[02:36:06.380 --> 02:36:09.500]  And jeffrey was like well, I think
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:11.580]  blockchain
[02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:18.780]  Do and I said well, can the home growers get in there and it needs to protect them and what he?
[02:36:19.980 --> 02:36:21.980]  He did is he made?
[02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:23.980]  ensure
[02:36:23.980 --> 02:36:25.980]  that no one
[02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:30.060]  But the breeder the grower
[02:36:30.540 --> 02:36:32.860]  to if you have a protection free
[02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:40.160]  Uh, it doesn't cost anything until you trigger the licensing agreements
[02:36:41.260 --> 02:36:43.260]  um, so it's really
[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:45.500]  been
[02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:46.620]  built
[02:36:46.620 --> 02:36:50.700]  By breeders. We we brought some amazing people that you're going to send
[02:37:03.450 --> 02:37:10.650]  A pathway forward for these legacies, um that makes sense. I think is really what we're doing
[02:37:11.050 --> 02:37:13.050]  So
[02:37:13.290 --> 02:37:15.290]  I we have a technical problem
[02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:18.570]  Everybody who is on the screen right now?
[02:37:19.130 --> 02:37:26.010]  We're gonna have to I just sent out a link a new link and i'm gonna need every come in on
[02:37:26.810 --> 02:37:28.810]  that link
[02:37:28.810 --> 02:37:30.330]  because
[02:37:30.330 --> 02:37:36.970]  Happened and we got booted out. We're fortunately streaming on future cannabis project network. Um,
[02:37:37.530 --> 02:37:39.530]  Thank you, london
[02:37:39.610 --> 02:37:42.570]  London no one can get in. Thanks peter
[02:37:43.530 --> 02:37:48.010]  If we do this, we're gonna lose future canvas project. No, no london's gonna come
[02:37:48.810 --> 02:37:50.810]  No, they're gonna come
[02:37:51.370 --> 02:37:53.850]  They're helping me. They're helping us get through
[02:37:55.530 --> 02:38:00.330]  Awesome. Thank you. Okay. Yes. I keep you to the rescue so
[02:38:01.290 --> 02:38:03.450]  This meeting and going through the other great
[02:38:04.330 --> 02:38:09.930]  Doing the other screen I need to get london's email into my email so I can get the links together
[02:38:09.930 --> 02:38:15.690]  So that'll take me a minute, but we'll be right there in just a minute. And if anyone that comes in cat if you could
[02:38:16.490 --> 02:38:17.930]  start the feed
[02:38:17.930 --> 02:38:20.090]  um, that would be great and and
[02:38:20.810 --> 02:38:23.690]  I would love it. If you want to come back on dale, that would be great
[02:38:23.770 --> 02:38:27.290]  if not, I know you're traveling but um, you are welcome to because I
[02:38:28.170 --> 02:38:30.410]  I think michael probably has more questions
[02:38:31.050 --> 02:38:33.050]  As if possible, but i'd rather
[02:38:33.770 --> 02:38:35.450]  Get it out there
[02:38:35.450 --> 02:38:37.770]  Um, because right now we're not out there. We're just recording
[02:38:38.570 --> 02:38:39.850]  Okay
[02:38:39.850 --> 02:38:41.850]  I didn't see you all at the dive bars
[02:38:42.410 --> 02:38:44.410]  I'm, just gonna say
[02:38:44.650 --> 02:38:46.650]  We don't
[02:38:48.330 --> 02:38:50.330]  See dale
[02:38:50.330 --> 02:38:53.130]  He is going to be in tan we
[02:38:54.250 --> 02:38:55.690]  We are putting
[02:38:55.690 --> 02:38:57.610]  an event together
[02:38:57.610 --> 02:38:58.650]  dale
[02:38:58.650 --> 02:39:02.810]  Put some money on the table and actually dale doesn't notice but kelly
[02:39:03.690 --> 02:39:06.490]  Raf i'll put some money on the table
[02:39:07.450 --> 02:39:12.330]  Lovely to make a pretty nice event at the inn on second and b
[02:39:13.050 --> 02:39:15.930]  for breeders to come and learn about what
[02:39:18.010 --> 02:39:23.130]  What a lot of us um, there'll be more about that, um coming up in the next few weeks, but
[02:39:24.890 --> 02:39:26.490]  Keep your eyes open
[02:39:26.570 --> 02:39:30.330]  Everybody thank you dale. I can't nice to meet you. Thank you
[02:39:33.370 --> 02:39:35.950]  Yeah, let's arrange for an interview
[02:39:39.370 --> 02:39:43.610]  I'd love that. Yes, all of you guys. Totally. Okay. I'm gonna get out of here
[02:39:46.650 --> 02:39:51.780]  Thank you
[02:39:52.020 --> 02:39:54.020]  All right, so
[02:39:54.980 --> 02:39:58.900]  Hopefully my kids aren't too loud. Hey adele, can you turn off the music for a second?
[02:39:58.980 --> 02:40:01.380]  I need you to turn it real quick. Thank you
[02:40:02.020 --> 02:40:02.980]  um
[02:40:02.980 --> 02:40:07.220]  We don't need we don't need no copyright issues on the on the channel. We're covering
[02:40:08.340 --> 02:40:10.660]  What I I would love you to say I love it when you sing
[02:40:10.660 --> 02:40:15.700]  Yes, do you want to sing for the people? My wife is about to sing publicly for everybody
[02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:18.500]  um, i'm just holding it down because I
[02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:22.500]  Might as well not close the stream because they're going to shoot me a link in a moment here
[02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:24.660]  um
[02:40:24.660 --> 02:40:26.260]  for it
[02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:33.620]  Uh, and we'll be right back with you. So hopefully you can deal with me and my my small children smashing things around
[02:40:35.860 --> 02:40:41.700]  Just one one small child smashing and a rattle, I hope you all appreciate it i'm gonna mute
[02:40:51.640 --> 02:40:55.420]  Hopefully we should have it sorted in a moment
[02:41:04.610 --> 02:41:07.940]  It's here
[02:41:10.660 --> 02:41:14.840]  Just a moment everybody hopefully you're doing wonderful and enjoying

[02:45:25.820 --> 02:45:27.820]  Yeah, thank you
[02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:31.660]  Those that are unfamiliar. Can you share a little bit more about your background?
[02:45:31.660 --> 02:45:38.940]  So I was born and raised up here in a little tiny town called honeydew in humboldt county it's kind of
[02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:45.420]  Out in southern humboldt in the middle of nowhere where a lot of the back to the landers
[02:45:45.980 --> 02:45:48.780]  um, you know first settled and started
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:56.700]  Homesteading and growing organic vegetables and growing cannabis to help supplement their incomes and raise their families and
[02:45:57.260 --> 02:46:03.500]  Um a lot of this, you know humble culture kind of evolved out from the hills where I grew up so
[02:46:04.220 --> 02:46:05.340]  um
[02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:11.920]  I've since you know, I've uh gone off to college and went to cal poly san luis obispo
[02:46:12.380 --> 02:46:15.020]  now we have a cal poly in humboldt too, but um
[02:46:15.900 --> 02:46:18.620]  yeah, I got a degree in mechanical engineering and then
[02:46:19.500 --> 02:46:25.980]  Ended up coming home and kind of developing the family business right in you know time for uh,
[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:27.740]  legalization
[02:46:27.740 --> 02:46:30.540]  into this new era, so I kind of
[02:46:31.580 --> 02:46:36.620]  Initially was just going to come home and do it for startup capital and then that evolved into
[02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:40.780]  You know, well, I guess I can keep doing this since now it's not
[02:46:41.660 --> 02:46:47.420]  Illegal as my family was growing and you know, i've got kids. I didn't want to be putting my livelihood at risk
[02:46:48.140 --> 02:46:51.420]  Any more than I had to so, um, you know now
[02:46:53.100 --> 02:46:54.620]  Now
[02:46:54.620 --> 02:46:59.580]  Now the struggle is real in this industry and and it's time to take another hard look at it
[02:46:59.660 --> 02:47:05.660]  um and see how much further we can push but i'm still going strong right now and
[02:47:06.220 --> 02:47:08.380]  prepping for this season, um
[02:47:08.940 --> 02:47:10.220]  We do
[02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:11.740]  You're still in a startup in a sense
[02:47:11.740 --> 02:47:12.380]  You're now, you know
[02:47:12.380 --> 02:47:14.940]  You came to raise capital for a startup and now with the way
[02:47:15.340 --> 02:47:19.260]  I know it's not necessarily a startup because it's been a you know long-term a family thing
[02:47:19.420 --> 02:47:25.020]  But with the transition and everything it is now a startup with all these regulations new things you're learning
[02:47:26.220 --> 02:47:28.220]  Yeah, so
[02:47:28.460 --> 02:47:34.220]  Now, you know today is the the spring equinox and which is obviously the beginning of spring
[02:47:34.380 --> 02:47:39.580]  Um, which means it's time to start preparing as a cannabis farmer
[02:47:39.820 --> 02:47:43.820]  Can you walk us through you know that overall process for you and how you're getting ready?
[02:47:44.780 --> 02:47:51.340]  Yeah in this new in this new market it's not really time to get started we've been going we never stop
[02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:56.720]  Um, so I had to keep a really, you know, when you're making your own cuts and doing your own genetics
[02:47:57.100 --> 02:48:01.820]  I have insulated greenhouses and i've been keeping healthy mother plants alive all winter
[02:48:02.380 --> 02:48:03.420]  um
[02:48:03.420 --> 02:48:07.920]  With just a little supplemental like led lighting to keep them from triggering
[02:48:11.660 --> 02:48:13.660]  But now it is
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:15.820]  Time to start working the dirt
[02:48:17.340 --> 02:48:19.440]  Getting the covers the greenhouses
[02:48:21.100 --> 02:48:23.100]  Since the snow
[02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:29.420]  We hope is kind of gone. I take the covers off to protect and kind of disassemble the whole light depth system
[02:48:29.740 --> 02:48:31.740]  So that it doesn't get damaged by the winter
[02:48:32.060 --> 02:48:34.620]  So right now we're getting covers back on we're tilling
[02:48:35.100 --> 02:48:40.620]  We're knocking down our our cover crops that we planted in our beds because once the covers are off then the natural rain
[02:48:41.180 --> 02:48:43.660]  And snow waters the beds and we put a bunch of
[02:48:44.620 --> 02:48:49.360]  Different beans and veg and different things to lock in the nitrogen
[02:48:50.220 --> 02:48:54.300]  so now we're killing those cover crops so we can tell them back in as we
[02:48:55.100 --> 02:49:02.700]  Add in our amendments and you know start brewing new batches of things and get all the cuttings. It's uh
[02:49:03.180 --> 02:49:05.280]  Been a lot of cuttings a lot of transplanting
[02:49:05.980 --> 02:49:06.940]  um
[02:49:06.940 --> 02:49:11.580]  But it's exciting and the year is off to a great looking start. Our plants are looking amazing
[02:49:12.220 --> 02:49:14.220]  Just hope the the market can
[02:49:14.540 --> 02:49:17.820]  Uh reward us for some of the hard work that we do this year
[02:49:18.620 --> 02:49:20.140]  Yeah, yeah
[02:49:20.140 --> 02:49:26.860]  And you know you mentioned um snow and you know, we are also here to raise funds for fire season as well
[02:49:26.940 --> 02:49:29.500]  but what other challenges do you have to um
[02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:32.060]  prepare for
[02:49:32.620 --> 02:49:36.380]  I mean, there's so many I can't even begin to list them all
[02:49:37.180 --> 02:49:41.260]  You know right now we're trying to actually we're doing some burn piles out there
[02:49:41.820 --> 02:49:45.740]  um, because that's always a fear and a struggle is
[02:49:46.300 --> 02:49:47.340]  um
[02:49:47.340 --> 02:49:50.780]  You know the fire so we did a lot of tree work in the off
[02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:57.180]  Beginning and in the middle of last year, so we're burning a lot of that so we don't have as much danger with that
[02:49:57.740 --> 02:49:58.860]  um
[02:49:58.860 --> 02:50:04.140]  a lot of my crew has actually kind of chosen to go other ways, so they're
[02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:08.860]  You know, um doing different things, but they're helping me get the year started
[02:50:09.420 --> 02:50:16.940]  um, so i'm having to interview people and and find new people that that will believe in what we're doing and want to help further
[02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:20.620]  the dreams that we have and work with us to do that, so
[02:50:21.340 --> 02:50:23.340]  um, that's a big one
[02:50:23.500 --> 02:50:25.500]  just getting a great team together and
[02:50:26.060 --> 02:50:27.080]  and
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:29.340]  restructuring because um this whole
[02:50:30.060 --> 02:50:32.960]  You know economy has changed so drastically
[02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:37.500]  in the last year in the last five years, it's um,
[02:50:38.300 --> 02:50:43.260]  The the regulatory system is really making things hard. Um
[02:50:44.540 --> 02:50:48.220]  We're still working on selling the last the product from last year
[02:50:48.780 --> 02:50:53.500]  As this year's expenses start so budgeting's huge and just trying to figure out how
[02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:55.900]  We can even sustain
[02:50:55.900 --> 02:50:58.060]  Keeping the business going right now to be honest
[02:50:58.700 --> 02:51:00.700]  is is a real struggle, so
[02:51:01.260 --> 02:51:05.340]  And and that's the thing that needs to come to light is that is the challenge, you know again
[02:51:05.500 --> 02:51:12.460]  Not a lot of those that are either unfamiliar with california or maybe they just they may not have as much connection with growers
[02:51:12.860 --> 02:51:18.140]  Um as you know, it might be nice to they they don't they may not have an understanding of those
[02:51:19.160 --> 02:51:20.380]  struggles
[02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:24.220]  So, you know for those that are interested in maybe potentially your hiring
[02:51:24.700 --> 02:51:29.180]  Um, how can they connect with you? I have a couple more questions, but I don't want to lose that part because we were just talking
[02:51:29.180 --> 02:51:31.180]  About it. Yeah
[02:51:31.340 --> 02:51:37.680]  Through instagram is one way and then um, just email. Um, so i'm royal cannabis at gmail.com
[02:51:38.460 --> 02:51:39.660]  another way
[02:51:39.660 --> 02:51:41.500]  um, you know
[02:51:41.500 --> 02:51:47.500]  not hard to get a hold of all the references on our website so i'm royal.com and our instagram and
[02:51:48.140 --> 02:51:52.460]  They all feed back to me. So i'm able to check all of that stuff
[02:51:53.180 --> 02:51:55.180]  So you can get in direct contact
[02:51:56.540 --> 02:52:03.100]  With sean as well through there now, um, you know things have changed and you know
[02:52:03.180 --> 02:52:06.380]  For those though that are unfamiliar with the process of growing cannabis
[02:52:06.780 --> 02:52:12.940]  Um, can you share more a little bit about how how long you know about what it takes and how long it is until harvest?
[02:52:12.940 --> 02:52:14.780]  season for for you
[02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:19.500]  Yeah, so it definitely depends on what type of farming you do and what type of grow you have
[02:52:19.980 --> 02:52:20.860]  um
[02:52:20.860 --> 02:52:22.860]  We're a combination of mixed light
[02:52:23.740 --> 02:52:30.540]  and um full term and so with the mixed light that's um, you know, we're doing light deprivation so
[02:52:31.080 --> 02:52:33.420]  Basically, we plant the plants
[02:52:33.900 --> 02:52:39.580]  Um it they start to grow we keep them at a certain light hours to make them in veg
[02:52:40.140 --> 02:52:43.980]  when we decide the time is right and we get our canopy where we want it we
[02:52:44.460 --> 02:52:47.740]  Flip them and make them have 12 and 12 hours of light
[02:52:48.380 --> 02:52:51.900]  And at that point they begin to flower which takes about two months
[02:52:52.460 --> 02:52:57.020]  Um, you know, so it's really labor intensive. You have to be out there
[02:52:57.660 --> 02:53:01.900]  Pulling huge covers over whatever, you know greenhouse size you have
[02:53:02.460 --> 02:53:08.860]  Um, we have like an outside greenhouse and then like another little inside greenhouse inside of that with
[02:53:09.340 --> 02:53:13.260]  Arms that roll the cover down and back up so one person can do it
[02:53:13.660 --> 02:53:16.780]  But it's still like you're battling the elements out there doing that
[02:53:17.580 --> 02:53:18.780]  and then
[02:53:18.780 --> 02:53:21.580]  Once that harvest is in, you know, it'll be about july
[02:53:22.300 --> 02:53:28.240]  Then we'll replant and do that a second time and that's where the highest quality
[02:53:28.780 --> 02:53:31.660]  for the market is coming from because it's kind of
[02:53:32.620 --> 02:53:36.940]  Mimicking the light cycles of indoor and producing a really high
[02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:40.220]  Quality flower that's ready in a faster time
[02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:41.740]  um
[02:53:41.740 --> 02:53:43.740]  Some people are using like full-on
[02:53:44.200 --> 02:53:49.260]  Hps lights and led lights to to do that. We don't do that. We have little tiny like
[02:53:49.900 --> 02:53:52.140]  super efficient because we're off grid so
[02:53:52.700 --> 02:53:54.060]  um
[02:53:54.060 --> 02:53:58.860]  And then for the full-term season, you know, you really want to plant more around beginning of june
[02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:04.220]  And you start those plants, um, you know month month and a half before that
[02:54:04.780 --> 02:54:07.360]  And then those will be out there all the way through mid-october
[02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:11.520]  November even early december depending on the genetics and
[02:54:12.240 --> 02:54:14.960]  um, but unfortunately the market really has
[02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:21.840]  shifted to a place where most people who only have outdoor aren't even planning on growing this year because
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:24.400]  the price that the
[02:54:24.480 --> 02:54:27.840]  labor and just the cost of producing that pound
[02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:32.800]  And the taxes and regulations that go along with having that license
[02:54:33.360 --> 02:54:34.880]  Are far
[02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:38.400]  Beyond what we can get for that product. So it's
[02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:42.400]  Makes no sense like i'm literally paying people money
[02:54:43.120 --> 02:54:46.880]  Every time I sell a pound at 350 dollars i'm paying them
[02:54:47.340 --> 02:54:51.600]  150 dollars of money that I spent to produce that that i'll never see again
[02:54:52.080 --> 02:54:57.280]  And I had to pay all of my workers and you know, everyone else is getting paid except for the business
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000]  and in a sense, so it's
[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:06.480]  Really challenging to start up another year with compounding years of
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:11.360]  Horrible market conditions kind of
[02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:15.440]  Against us
[02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:21.680]  This is common. This is the story is happening even potentially most of them are losing money
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:26.240]  We're all taking a loss this last year and most people can't afford to do it again
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:32.000]  So that's the real struggle right now is finding a way to to make it happen this year
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:34.800]  Yeah, yeah
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:42.560]  Yeah, thank you. Sean. Um, you know, a lot of farms are going fallow this year and we mentioned how in one county
[02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:46.960]  There's six out of over 450 that were in the process
[02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:49.040]  Yeah
[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:50.640]  it's not
[02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:54.240]  It's it is a tough situation. But what I know about us
[02:55:54.880 --> 02:55:57.460]  Is that we're really good at navigating tough situations
[02:55:58.880 --> 02:56:01.600]  Yeah, it's not the first time we've been through a rough time and
[02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:05.600]  You know been up against some serious obstacles. We just need
[02:56:06.240 --> 02:56:10.720]  Some changes to happen in the in the industry in general and in our market
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:17.060]  I think the education is really coming around where people are starting to value the quality that we're producing
[02:56:17.680 --> 02:56:18.480]  um
[02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:24.240]  We're actually part of this initiative with cookies and they're highlighting some humble farms
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:27.220]  And it's called the humble grown initiative
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:29.200]  um
[02:56:29.200 --> 02:56:32.800]  and they're going to be selling humble produced flour by
[02:56:33.660 --> 02:56:34.960]  organic
[02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:41.600]  Good producers in their packaging and really showcasing the quality that can come from outdoor just to help educate
[02:56:42.380 --> 02:56:44.880]  Consumers even in that side of the market
[02:56:45.360 --> 02:56:51.120]  That's good to hear that's and and two what is another way the those that are tuning in, you know, how can they support you?
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:56.560]  I know it's probably going to their local dispensaries asking for so so hum royal, uh,
[02:56:56.560 --> 02:56:59.360]  Any other ways out there that they can help support?
[02:57:00.640 --> 02:57:08.480]  Yeah, I mean that's definitely the best way just just uh caring about where your products come from and like trying to get to
[02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:10.880]  Who's really producing this stuff?
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:17.520]  Producing this stuff and what's really going into it because the you know, the more people do realize that
[02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:21.360]  There's a difference between stuff that's completely produced with
[02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:25.760]  Just straight chemical fertilizers and often too much of them
[02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:30.720]  um, it lacks the terpene profiles it lacks the full-bodied effects that
[02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:34.560]  um, you know true organic sun-grown flour does
[02:57:35.280 --> 02:57:38.870]  Thank you
[02:57:38.870 --> 02:57:43.830]  We're all working hard to figure out ways to share with the rest of the world what?
[02:57:44.470 --> 02:57:48.150]  Sean and and other folks already understand about the plant
[02:57:49.030 --> 02:57:50.310]  um
[02:57:50.310 --> 02:57:52.310]  It needs that sunshine right sean
[02:57:52.870 --> 02:57:54.310]  Oh, yeah
[02:57:54.310 --> 02:57:56.310]  Love the real sunshine
[02:57:57.750 --> 02:58:00.950]  Ah, thank you. Well, thank you for joining us sean
[02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:04.710]  We appreciate it and sharing a little bit of your story with everybody
[02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:07.270]  Adelia, do you know what do we have next?
[02:58:08.070 --> 02:58:10.070]  Yeah, so yeah
[02:58:10.310 --> 02:58:12.310]  Thank you. Sean. Yeah
[02:58:12.470 --> 02:58:18.070]  next up is um, so it is Evian and Christian. All right, we're
[02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:21.590]  Ethical data alliance
[02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:25.430]  Nice, we're gonna show a quick video and then we'll have them on. Thank you
[02:58:26.790 --> 02:58:31.910]  Random roadblocks in the mountains and say someone stole a tractor or something
[02:58:32.310 --> 02:58:35.110]  A tractor or something and they just set up a roadblock
[02:58:35.270 --> 02:58:39.270]  And so we'd have the kids from high school like ishi and them and sam next door
[02:58:39.350 --> 02:58:42.230]  he would uh, they would call us when they get to the high school and be like
[02:58:42.790 --> 02:58:46.550]  The roadblock was on the petrolea side. The roadblock was on the honeydew side today
[02:58:46.550 --> 02:58:49.030]  And so we'd drive out of town because we could go either way
[02:58:49.590 --> 02:58:53.690]  But these this one couple got caught with like two joints, I believe at the roadblock
[02:58:54.390 --> 02:58:56.390]  And they forced their way up onto their house
[02:58:57.190 --> 02:59:02.250]  And they ended up beating the case through one of the first ever medical defenses
[02:59:02.950 --> 02:59:07.270]  um in the state and it gave us the curtilage law which
[02:59:07.670 --> 02:59:11.370]  Right gave us the right that they could no longer search our greenhouses
[02:59:12.070 --> 02:59:14.950]  Just due to the fact that they could see green inside it, right?
[02:59:15.110 --> 02:59:19.910]  And so that was one of the major first things I remember that gave people
[02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:22.870]  You know the courage
[02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:26.790]  To to get it out there to put the greenhouse out. I remember that bigger
[02:59:31.630 --> 02:59:40.030]  Hey michael, hello, welcome back. Welcome back i'm gonna pull christian and let's see there she is
[02:59:42.350 --> 02:59:43.070]  All right
[02:59:43.070 --> 02:59:51.550]  Hi guys, this is michael. He's he's a host at royal grown radio and also works for royal gold soil and
[02:59:52.110 --> 02:59:57.150]  Has knows a lot and and I thought it would be great for you guys to talk to him because
[02:59:58.030 --> 03:00:00.510]  He has the perspective that a lot of folks have
[03:00:01.310 --> 03:00:02.270]  Why?
[03:00:02.270 --> 03:00:09.470]  Why does data matter when we're talking about this plant and what the heck are we are we digitalizing something?
[03:00:09.550 --> 03:00:11.390]  That's so organic
[03:00:11.390 --> 03:00:13.230]  and so i'd love to
[03:00:13.230 --> 03:00:17.470]  Put you two together and step out and let me hear what you all have to say
[03:00:18.830 --> 03:00:21.070]  Welcome lovely. Thank you. Thanks
[03:00:21.630 --> 03:00:23.310]  Leslie
[03:00:23.310 --> 03:00:28.190]  Hello christian. I love you really a pleasure to meet you both and like lele said I
[03:00:28.990 --> 03:00:31.550]  i'm, so intrigued by all of this
[03:00:32.510 --> 03:00:38.830]  kind of new homogenization of data and genetics and all of these things moving forward to protect the legacy cultures and
[03:00:39.790 --> 03:00:45.790]  Tell me a little bit about what alpha ethical data alliance does and what the purpose is here
[03:00:46.430 --> 03:00:51.230]  Um, so I think i'll take that one, um, so basically a couple years ago
[03:00:51.310 --> 03:00:55.470]  I'm sure you're aware of what happened with the whole phyllo skate drama
[03:00:55.790 --> 03:00:58.990]  Um, i'm sure a lot of people who are watching are very familiar with that
[03:00:59.630 --> 03:01:02.590]  And formerly there was something called the open cannabis project
[03:01:02.990 --> 03:01:08.050]  That was kind of involved with phyllos and the whole idea had been to help protect genetics
[03:01:08.670 --> 03:01:13.710]  um, you know and help protect some of the legacy people and create using data and
[03:01:14.430 --> 03:01:21.710]  Um, and that imploded in a whole bunch of ways that people there's a few wonderful people. Um, angela bacca dale hunt myself
[03:01:22.350 --> 03:01:23.390]  um
[03:01:23.390 --> 03:01:27.650]  Slowly started to formulate this idea that we needed something that was fully transparent
[03:01:28.510 --> 03:01:30.510]  to help bring
[03:01:30.830 --> 03:01:36.670]  um, I mean honestly, it's to help protect every all the work that we've done for so long, especially breeders and
[03:01:37.230 --> 03:01:38.990]  the genetics piece
[03:01:38.990 --> 03:01:47.390]  And producers and so we created this and then slowly the ideas came in for technology and so christian, uh joined us and
[03:01:48.350 --> 03:01:51.650]  We really see this missing link of being able to storytell
[03:01:52.430 --> 03:01:54.510]  All the way from the breeders
[03:01:55.150 --> 03:01:55.950]  To you know
[03:01:55.950 --> 03:02:03.490]  The genomic sequencing all of these different little pieces the nursery the producer all of the cultivation information
[03:02:04.370 --> 03:02:09.510]  And we realized that because of the issues that had happened previously with like ethics and transparency
[03:02:10.210 --> 03:02:12.930]  That it needed to happen in such a way that it was
[03:02:13.470 --> 03:02:20.610]  Completely transparent mission so that people could join us and basically this is kind of like a gift back to the community
[03:02:20.690 --> 03:02:22.690]  So we founded a non-profit
[03:02:23.170 --> 03:02:25.350]  um with the help of ed rosenthal
[03:02:26.130 --> 03:02:27.010]  to
[03:02:27.010 --> 03:02:29.010]  under the arm of greenade, um
[03:02:29.170 --> 03:02:32.290]  Which is a non-profit he's had for a long time and so
[03:02:32.770 --> 03:02:35.410]  The ethical data alliance has basically come together
[03:02:35.490 --> 03:02:39.810]  There's all sorts of incredible people and the vision was that we would have
[03:02:40.290 --> 03:02:42.610]  that christian came in with a great vision that we would
[03:02:43.250 --> 03:02:49.510]  I'll let him speak to it. But the eating protocol is basically separate from the eda is basically a gatekeeper
[03:02:50.130 --> 03:02:51.010]  to
[03:02:51.010 --> 03:02:54.470]  That project and the ideas that we're going to be able to utilize
[03:02:55.190 --> 03:02:57.430]  The blockchain technology to storage
[03:02:57.990 --> 03:02:59.990]  Tells supply chain traceability
[03:03:00.550 --> 03:03:03.750]  And so, you know people have concerns around digitizing the plant
[03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:05.030]  I think that you know
[03:03:05.030 --> 03:03:08.870]  We already work in the regulated adult use market with things like um, you know
[03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:13.030]  We're kind of forced to use these uh seed to sale tracking systems and other things
[03:03:13.030 --> 03:03:17.910]  But it's a missing link as far as how we can actually elegantly tell the story
[03:03:18.310 --> 03:03:21.590]  Of all of these different things and then actually certify the data
[03:03:22.230 --> 03:03:28.230]  and own our own data, which I mean i'm sure everybody's very well aware of the fact that like google and
[03:03:28.710 --> 03:03:33.670]  The metaverse and all of these other things anytime you're plugging and playing with something like that
[03:03:33.910 --> 03:03:41.510]  You're you're giving away your data and this allows um the system that we've christian will point to uh shortly
[03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:44.470]  Basically allows people to plug and play
[03:03:45.030 --> 03:03:47.030]  And it's for everybody. It's not you know
[03:03:47.350 --> 03:03:52.390]  For everybody who wants to choose to do it ethically and transparently I guess would be the better way to say it but um
[03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:56.630]  It's it's kind of a collective vision. We have a really incredible team of people
[03:03:56.710 --> 03:04:00.390]  we've been working with for two years now on this project and we have
[03:04:01.030 --> 03:04:03.510]  the blockchain professor at harvard we have
[03:04:04.470 --> 03:04:07.910]  you know wonderful doctors and lawyers and
[03:04:08.610 --> 03:04:14.070]  Producers and cultivators and all sorts of people who are involved and um, it really is for everybody
[03:04:14.230 --> 03:04:18.550]  So, um, you know, it's kind of brief brief overview. I mean there's more to it, but
[03:04:19.030 --> 03:04:21.030]  That's kind of the gist of what we're doing
[03:04:21.430 --> 03:04:27.830]  it's absolutely fascinating and the depth and breadth of the entire project is really what kind of
[03:04:28.870 --> 03:04:31.990]  really appeals to me and really has me so interested in
[03:04:32.950 --> 03:04:34.950]  so
[03:04:35.590 --> 03:04:37.610]  It's not about necessarily controlling
[03:04:38.390 --> 03:04:43.190]  Yes, there is some degree of wanting to have control over your own property and you know
[03:04:43.270 --> 03:04:45.270]  protecting that but it's about
[03:04:45.990 --> 03:04:51.510]  Being able to share the stories in a big way. It's about track and trace being linked to a more
[03:04:52.070 --> 03:04:54.550]  Ethical form of data and I love what you said
[03:04:55.270 --> 03:04:56.390]  about
[03:04:56.390 --> 03:05:01.350]  The data being captured by metaverse and etc. Our data is valuable
[03:05:01.670 --> 03:05:05.510]  It is extremely valuable and we need to find ways to protect that
[03:05:06.230 --> 03:05:08.630]  In an ethical way when there's so many, you know
[03:05:08.710 --> 03:05:15.830]  Unethical companies out there grabbing the data as fast as we share it and platforms kind of unwittingly giving things away and
[03:05:16.310 --> 03:05:21.030]  You know the phylos kind of scandal if you will was another example of people
[03:05:21.990 --> 03:05:23.990]  Offering data and information
[03:05:24.470 --> 03:05:30.230]  And what they thought was a safe way to only have it, you know disseminated in a way that wasn't what they thought
[03:05:30.790 --> 03:05:31.670]  so
[03:05:31.670 --> 03:05:33.430]  I really i'm i'm interested
[03:05:33.510 --> 03:05:38.390]  And so how does the electronic data side come in to play with this blockchain because
[03:05:38.790 --> 03:05:42.630]  That's where it starts to lose me as not the most technologically advanced person
[03:05:44.390 --> 03:05:46.390]  I'll take that one if you're on
[03:05:46.870 --> 03:05:47.670]  Pleasure to be here
[03:05:47.670 --> 03:05:49.990]  It's an honor actually to be here with you know
[03:05:50.070 --> 03:05:56.470]  All the real og people who've been providing great medicine for so long and fighting for the rights to do so
[03:05:57.030 --> 03:06:00.070]  Uh, so I come from the crypto world and
[03:06:01.090 --> 03:06:02.550]  unrelated
[03:06:02.550 --> 03:06:10.010]  Space in terms of the difficulties that you know cryptocurrencies have had to face with you know the relationship with society
[03:06:10.550 --> 03:06:12.890]  Uh, but when you look at what cryptocurrencies
[03:06:13.990 --> 03:06:15.990]  are doing
[03:06:15.990 --> 03:06:18.310]  You back the key to something
[03:06:19.830 --> 03:06:25.990]  And and okay that works for bitcoin, but when you think about it, you can also apply it to your data
[03:06:26.710 --> 03:06:29.430]  And you know make no mistake. We we are now
[03:06:30.390 --> 03:06:33.110]  Or in the information age or some such
[03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:36.470]  And uh your data is is is leaking
[03:06:37.190 --> 03:06:42.630]  It's leaking out and these companies are taking it. This is recorded. They're analyzing the metadata
[03:06:42.630 --> 03:06:48.150]  They know more about me and you than me and you know about ourselves, which is also why everything is harder
[03:06:48.710 --> 03:06:53.990]  Right. What happened to being able to just make a living with one job, you know, or one, you know, kind of, you know
[03:06:54.150 --> 03:06:58.230]  Passion no now you gotta have three four things going on because what happened?
[03:06:58.790 --> 03:07:04.550]  Oh, yeah, the data is leaking and so much of the value of what we produce is now in the data
[03:07:05.270 --> 03:07:09.430]  If we don't control that someone else does for sure and we know we know where that goes
[03:07:09.910 --> 03:07:13.770]  so so it's time now by these cryptocurrencies
[03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:16.710]  they provide the
[03:07:16.790 --> 03:07:19.030]  The the magic formula, right?
[03:07:19.590 --> 03:07:24.230]  The secret sauce which we can reuse we don't need to reinvent here anything
[03:07:24.550 --> 03:07:28.950]  We can reuse something that has been now working for 10 plus 12 years
[03:07:29.350 --> 03:07:32.710]  In in the financial world and apply it to
[03:07:33.350 --> 03:07:35.350]  Well to our data and then the question is
[03:07:36.150 --> 03:07:40.470]  Okay, what does that mean? You know, what do you do? So what you do is that
[03:07:41.430 --> 03:07:47.610]  You use these technologies to take ownership of your data, you know when you want to uh notarize
[03:07:48.150 --> 03:07:53.990]  you know something or if you want to you know, capture the it on on a
[03:07:54.550 --> 03:08:00.150]  Thing you've built. Uh, I mean it's hard right? You got to bring evidence. There's so much the requirements
[03:08:00.150 --> 03:08:03.270]  You know, you got to be able to show evidence a lot of stuff
[03:08:03.750 --> 03:08:05.350]  So that's all data
[03:08:05.350 --> 03:08:09.430]  So do it and now the tools with computers and internet of things
[03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:15.350]  I mean it can be used to spy on you, but it can also be used for you to spy on your on your crops
[03:08:15.670 --> 03:08:21.430]  Right and on your product and so film it, you know, you play mozart. Okay, which song record it?
[03:08:21.510 --> 03:08:29.030]  Someone might want to know that one day and so all these little things add up right now that data today
[03:08:29.110 --> 03:08:30.790]  You keep in your database
[03:08:30.790 --> 03:08:37.270]  And it's got a lot of firewalls and securities and locks and don't touch and guard dogs and nobody can get to your data
[03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:39.670]  Because you know, it's valuable
[03:08:39.990 --> 03:08:43.430]  Except that's on your google drive. So google's got it, but you know the rest of us
[03:08:45.590 --> 03:08:50.470]  Um, but you know, it's valuable but what do you do how do you value it?
[03:08:51.430 --> 03:08:55.830]  Again before crypto very hard to do right you have to go to markets now. That's all
[03:08:56.470 --> 03:09:02.790]  Things that's complicated. So now the tools are there, you know, you can create these things, you know these
[03:09:03.430 --> 03:09:05.430]  We'll just call them tokens
[03:09:05.430 --> 03:09:12.230]  But you know, it's just uh, it's a coupon, right? It's a it's a it's a club membership point
[03:09:12.390 --> 03:09:16.870]  It's a frequent flyer mile. It's a it's a unit of something
[03:09:17.190 --> 03:09:22.310]  And you can attach information to it so it's good for tracking maybe
[03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:26.550]  You know how many miles you fly but can also be good for tracking
[03:09:26.950 --> 03:09:33.350]  the the food miles or the miles that you know, the the the plant has traveled, you know from from the farm to
[03:09:34.130 --> 03:09:37.510]  Dispensary and so there's so much information. We want to know
[03:09:38.310 --> 03:09:40.150]  We know it's captured
[03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:45.190]  How do we share it and that's where the ethical data alliance and we kind of kind of?
[03:09:45.670 --> 03:09:51.750]  You know joined we met on that question. Okay, so we know that we know the problem the problem is that the data needs to
[03:09:52.870 --> 03:09:56.950]  Move more, right? We need to share more the data so we can understand the plant better
[03:09:57.270 --> 03:10:03.990]  So the physicians so the patients so the consumers so the growers so everybody right can know more about the plant
[03:10:04.150 --> 03:10:08.470]  But as soon as I share something someone else steals it and takes it for their own and claims it
[03:10:09.430 --> 03:10:11.190]  Now i'm working hard again
[03:10:11.190 --> 03:10:15.990]  So what we're doing with the blockchain technology if you will
[03:10:16.630 --> 03:10:22.310]  Is when we're we're notarizing everything we're using blockchain as a third-party witness
[03:10:22.630 --> 03:10:25.830]  Which is what a notary is right? So i'm not using a legal term here
[03:10:25.830 --> 03:10:33.670]  I know this is not the legal definition of notarizing but it's the same process where we're using an independent third party
[03:10:34.310 --> 03:10:36.310]  Let's call that a blockchain
[03:10:36.310 --> 03:10:43.190]  And the blockchain is just a stamp just put the stamp there the blockchain doesn't have the data the data stays very secure with you
[03:10:43.750 --> 03:10:48.870]  And but what you put on the blockchain in a public space is something meaningless
[03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:50.950]  It's like a fingerprint of your data
[03:10:51.190 --> 03:10:56.730]  It can prove and the blockchain is there to prove the time and date when you had that fingerprint
[03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:58.870]  So it can prove that
[03:10:58.870 --> 03:11:06.550]  On this date, right you filed your notes about how you were aiming to reach certain goals with this batch
[03:11:06.950 --> 03:11:08.950]  And you still don't know if you've reached them
[03:11:09.110 --> 03:11:15.030]  But here are the notes about what the goals are so that if you reach them and you find that out six months from now
[03:11:15.430 --> 03:11:22.650]  You can go back and prove to people because there's a fingerprint and a date stamp and a noblery stamp if you will on your document
[03:11:23.190 --> 03:11:27.430]  And all of that is doable digitally right now for for practically no cost
[03:11:27.750 --> 03:11:30.230]  Most of the tools to do this exist for free
[03:11:30.550 --> 03:11:35.590]  We're doing pilots right now with growers and a bunch of you know participants along the supply chain
[03:11:36.150 --> 03:11:40.230]  And as Jan mentioned we're telling the story of our product. So we're using this technology
[03:11:40.230 --> 03:11:43.590]  Everybody's you know, what do you want to tell about what you do about your product?
[03:11:43.830 --> 03:11:48.310]  Right. Everyone's got a little value add that's why why my thing is a little better than your thing
[03:11:48.710 --> 03:11:53.270]  Okay, well say that right and say that put it on a little token thing, right?
[03:11:53.590 --> 03:11:58.550]  And then we're stringing all of these and you're distributing that with the product so the patient the
[03:11:58.870 --> 03:12:00.870]  person buying at the end of the supply line
[03:12:01.430 --> 03:12:03.430]  Says oh I can scan a qr code
[03:12:04.230 --> 03:12:09.190]  And here's the string history written by the actual people who actually touch this product
[03:12:09.670 --> 03:12:13.910]  And it proves the authenticity where it's been when whatever you want to share
[03:12:14.310 --> 03:12:19.750]  And this is the public face. Obviously you can do private stuff, but we'll leave it at that for now, right?
[03:12:20.470 --> 03:12:27.510]  Wow, so that's amazing. So you're basically taking the technology that says, you know, we can assign that qr code essentially
[03:12:28.550 --> 03:12:30.550]  You can view this and we can say
[03:12:31.350 --> 03:12:32.390]  Okay
[03:12:32.390 --> 03:12:37.670]  this person brought this genetic over or this genetic was found at this place and traces back to
[03:12:38.450 --> 03:12:44.150]  Afghanistan and this other genetic came from africa and these were combined in these locations at these times
[03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:47.910]  And this is the value of this process
[03:12:49.990 --> 03:12:51.990]  Yeah
[03:12:52.310 --> 03:12:55.350]  There's an infinite number of stories to tell and today
[03:12:55.910 --> 03:13:01.270]  How do you tell right? You're you're just a nursery. How do you get your story out?
[03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:06.950]  I mean, you know at the time it becomes a commercial product. Nobody thinks about the nursery anymore
[03:13:07.270 --> 03:13:11.910]  So there's so much and and now we have the technology to do it. Everybody can do this again
[03:13:11.910 --> 03:13:13.910]  It doesn't cost much or anything
[03:13:14.390 --> 03:13:20.230]  So so as long as you do it the same way then we can string whatever you've got to say about your product
[03:13:20.790 --> 03:13:25.590]  And and this is now at the batch level, you know, we're all used now to to skew
[03:13:26.130 --> 03:13:29.270]  Numbers that are more like, you know product level now
[03:13:29.350 --> 03:13:34.810]  We're going one more level deep right and again, the technology is there to support that level of detail nowadays
[03:13:35.350 --> 03:13:41.270]  So it really empowers the little guy, right? Because those are those are big guy tools
[03:13:41.590 --> 03:13:46.070]  This is the walmart kind of technology, right where walmart was able to tell the world you go
[03:13:46.070 --> 03:13:48.630]  You shall do it like this and everybody said yes
[03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:52.870]  Yes, and of course walmart then had an advantage because everybody was doing it the walmart way
[03:13:53.190 --> 03:13:58.150]  So that's how the big guys do it top down. This is a technology that's completely bottoms up
[03:13:58.470 --> 03:14:02.870]  It's we're all little guys and we're doing the tech we need in order to get
[03:14:03.350 --> 03:14:10.870]  Our value add and a value of our product out there so that when someone you know has to choose between two product are informed
[03:14:11.110 --> 03:14:13.130]  You can make the right decision and the information
[03:14:13.830 --> 03:14:19.750]  Is is provably authentic from the source. That's important in the world of you know lies
[03:14:20.470 --> 03:14:24.150]  Oh, yeah, and as the future comes I think that I think it's just this missing link
[03:14:24.230 --> 03:14:24.550]  You know
[03:14:24.550 --> 03:14:27.990]  I think a lot of us who have been in the cannabis space for a long time really see
[03:14:28.550 --> 03:14:32.470]  That there's a lot of issues with supply chain traceability and that metric
[03:14:33.190 --> 03:14:34.950]  for the adult use
[03:14:34.950 --> 03:14:41.270]  Only fills a certain gap for people and that there's so many missing links and a hugest part of the link is
[03:14:41.590 --> 03:14:46.550]  For me and part of the reason I felt so passionate and have worked on this project for the past two years
[03:14:47.590 --> 03:14:51.510]  as a non-profit i'm a board member of the ethical data alliance is because
[03:14:52.230 --> 03:14:53.430]  um
[03:14:53.430 --> 03:14:57.210]  There is this massive issue with authenticity of of genetics
[03:14:57.830 --> 03:14:59.830]  across the board and so
[03:14:59.830 --> 03:15:05.510]  That for me was my passion because I feel like i've you know, it's like i've run five different
[03:15:05.990 --> 03:15:09.510]  Cuts of wedding cake and nobody really knows which the true
[03:15:09.910 --> 03:15:13.990]  One is and how it all authenticates and then for the end consumer at the patient level
[03:15:14.470 --> 03:15:17.910]  if they find some, you know people need consistent medicine also and
[03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:22.810]  I think that there's just there's so many there's lots of issues and basically the technology
[03:15:23.610 --> 03:15:25.610]  That we've been working towards is
[03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:32.170]  Solutions to so many different problems along the way and it really is for everybody. This is a plug and play system
[03:15:32.810 --> 03:15:38.490]  That could work if people are on board with the genetic or on board with the ethics piece
[03:15:38.970 --> 03:15:40.810]  and I will just say too that um
[03:15:40.810 --> 03:15:43.530]  You know big part for the group with the ethical data alliance
[03:15:43.530 --> 03:15:47.710]  We were doing our founding was that we really do care. There's a lot of care around sustainability
[03:15:48.490 --> 03:15:49.850]  and um
[03:15:49.850 --> 03:15:56.730]  You know that we use the the un sustainable guidelines as kind of like a guiding light for us in building that because there is
[03:15:56.810 --> 03:15:59.870]  Concerns around the technology and the impact to the environment
[03:16:00.410 --> 03:16:04.570]  So we definitely have been trying to caretake the whole process
[03:16:05.050 --> 03:16:07.370]  and and as much of it as possible chris
[03:16:07.370 --> 03:16:12.250]  We're so blessed to have christian because as much of it as possible. We want to make sure is
[03:16:12.870 --> 03:16:15.610]  Accessible for people like us like that
[03:16:15.610 --> 03:16:19.930]  I can go in and learn how to do this or somebody on my team can learn how to do this and that
[03:16:20.490 --> 03:16:22.490]  um, we're able to
[03:16:22.730 --> 03:16:27.450]  Uh show, you know this beautiful proof of concept with the pilots that we've been working on
[03:16:27.850 --> 03:16:33.450]  This is I believe the second pilot that we're working towards and there's multiple kind of happening at the same time now
[03:16:34.010 --> 03:16:35.210]  but um
[03:16:35.210 --> 03:16:39.850]  It's the same essential theory that you know, you go to the store and you buy some green juice
[03:16:39.930 --> 03:16:44.570]  You have no idea where it came from. You have no idea. It's authentically what somebody says it is
[03:16:45.050 --> 03:16:46.570]  and and so
[03:16:46.570 --> 03:16:54.410]  Essentially, I think cannabis has the ability to start showcasing and it's such a complex supply chain that we operate in
[03:16:54.730 --> 03:16:57.130]  I mean very few other industries have this
[03:16:58.170 --> 03:17:02.970]  Really nuanced, you know, we do we have breeders. We have the historical breeding before that we have
[03:17:03.930 --> 03:17:07.210]  Genomic sequencing we have the nurseries. We have the producers
[03:17:07.290 --> 03:17:10.250]  We have all of the different ancillary things that come in there
[03:17:10.810 --> 03:17:17.050]  And then from the producer we have even we have labs we have coas it gets made into products sometimes and then from there
[03:17:17.130 --> 03:17:18.650]  There's dispensary
[03:17:18.650 --> 03:17:20.650]  uh, and then there's the end there's
[03:17:21.050 --> 03:17:27.610]  Grading companies there's uh, you know third party certifications for sun and earth cert all these different things
[03:17:27.930 --> 03:17:33.130]  But there's no way to elegantly storytell the whole piece and also for it to help
[03:17:33.450 --> 03:17:38.730]  Um, you know if somebody really finds something and it's not just I want to say also that in addition to cannabis
[03:17:38.810 --> 03:17:40.650]  We were really looking at
[03:17:40.650 --> 03:17:44.330]  All biological substances that may need some sort of protection also
[03:17:44.730 --> 03:17:50.010]  Along these lines and how you know, we've already seen a lot of issues with ip and I believe other people today
[03:17:50.010 --> 03:17:52.970]  I've spoken to that and so we've had a lot of um
[03:17:53.850 --> 03:17:58.410]  legal input on the ip side too and how that how we can actually
[03:17:58.810 --> 03:18:04.890]  This is this really is a service back to the community and we encourage people to come and join us and join the mission
[03:18:04.970 --> 03:18:07.610]  You know, it's a non-profit mission. It's all volunteer based
[03:18:08.250 --> 03:18:09.690]  so, um
[03:18:09.690 --> 03:18:15.690]  we have a really great team and it's open for people to join the efforts and see how we can
[03:18:16.250 --> 03:18:20.090]  Um, you know create solutions for these issues in the industry
[03:18:21.370 --> 03:18:27.450]  It's just absolutely so fascinating. Um, and the team has really been so impressive to me the people that i've talked to
[03:18:27.690 --> 03:18:32.330]  um, you know, including yourselves jeff and belenia and kevin and
[03:18:32.970 --> 03:18:38.330]  What an amazing group of people to come from so many different perspectives and for me at this point
[03:18:38.330 --> 03:18:43.050]  this is one of the things that I think really speaks to the depth of the project is
[03:18:43.610 --> 03:18:46.090]  the value of the alternate perspectives if
[03:18:46.810 --> 03:18:52.030]  You have a bunch of experts in their field coming at it and viewing it from a completely different perspective
[03:18:52.250 --> 03:18:54.570]  And elevating the entire platform together
[03:18:55.850 --> 03:18:59.210]  To put power back in the little man's hand and give control
[03:19:00.090 --> 03:19:04.410]  Of your data, which wow it's it's mind-boggling to me
[03:19:05.050 --> 03:19:06.570]  from that
[03:19:06.570 --> 03:19:07.690]  perspective
[03:19:07.690 --> 03:19:09.930]  This project is attracting attention
[03:19:10.490 --> 03:19:18.670]  From the cryptocurrency community and we've received funding earlier on last year from a group called filecoin
[03:19:19.370 --> 03:19:22.650]  Uh for the tech for a technical component of the project
[03:19:22.730 --> 03:19:27.770]  So it's it's very specific but still right the crypto community is looking at what we're doing
[03:19:27.770 --> 03:19:30.570]  They're like, oh they need help here and they finance one of them
[03:19:31.130 --> 03:19:35.690]  The things we needed and the thing we needed to give away for free, right?
[03:19:35.770 --> 03:19:40.570]  So it's not like, you know, we're a big huge corporation here. No, no, no one's making money
[03:19:40.730 --> 03:19:43.850]  It's something we're giving out for free and this group said yeah
[03:19:43.930 --> 03:19:48.250]  This someone needs to pay for it to get a good engineer to do it. And so that's happening
[03:19:48.730 --> 03:19:50.170]  um the
[03:19:50.170 --> 03:19:52.010]  ethical data community
[03:19:52.010 --> 03:19:58.410]  Which is a thing all unto its own right kind of like it's kind of the the big data has had its day now for
[03:19:58.730 --> 03:20:00.730]  What 10 15 20 years?
[03:20:00.730 --> 03:20:04.570]  Uh, there's starting to be a pushback right and yeah at all levels
[03:20:05.050 --> 03:20:10.250]  As a thing so that community is coming in saying, you know, who are you guys? Oh, yeah
[03:20:10.870 --> 03:20:12.170]  blockchain
[03:20:12.170 --> 03:20:18.490]  Cannabis, so the cannabis community is in and the supply chain supply chain management is huge. Look at our world
[03:20:19.130 --> 03:20:22.810]  It's going crazy right now we need supply chain traceability
[03:20:22.810 --> 03:20:26.650]  We need to know, you know how our products get from one place to another
[03:20:26.970 --> 03:20:30.090]  So those groups are also interested in in what we're doing
[03:20:30.410 --> 03:20:37.610]  So it's a really really exciting pilot that will bring a lot of attention to the to the brands to the people involved
[03:20:37.770 --> 03:20:42.250]  Right. I mean we say it's it's small. It is small individuals are welcome, too
[03:20:42.330 --> 03:20:48.090]  You can be a you can grow in your in your in your closet and and still you know gain value from this
[03:20:48.650 --> 03:20:53.450]  Um, but you know, if you if you don't then you have a farm and you're trying to get your farm name out there
[03:20:53.530 --> 03:20:57.850]  This is also a good way to do it and and some of this attention will be global
[03:20:57.930 --> 03:20:59.930]  So it's gonna be rock and roll
[03:21:00.170 --> 03:21:04.170]  I love it. And you know, I came into this conversation through royal grown radio
[03:21:04.250 --> 03:21:08.830]  Just asking questions through lillenia and the you know, humble grace community
[03:21:10.090 --> 03:21:15.050]  But as somebody who's involved with royal gold as a company it lets me think oh wow
[03:21:15.050 --> 03:21:19.930]  There are so many similar applications that we can use for what we do and say soil building or say
[03:21:20.330 --> 03:21:25.690]  You know, like you're saying a green juice where you can track back. No, this is cholera. This is spirulina. These are the
[03:21:26.570 --> 03:21:33.290]  genetic profiles of these individual organisms going in you're we're building soil with these ingredients to achieve this goal and
[03:21:33.930 --> 03:21:35.930]  It just provides so much
[03:21:37.050 --> 03:21:38.890]  value
[03:21:38.890 --> 03:21:42.090]  To the concepts and not just the product
[03:21:42.650 --> 03:21:43.770]  100
[03:21:43.770 --> 03:21:47.850]  And just really quick christian. I just want to say that even like for royal gold and for other you know
[03:21:47.850 --> 03:21:50.650]  So it's like because we don't know, you know, like what what's the?
[03:21:51.210 --> 03:21:54.810]  We actually have had people from the grow off join us in the past and they know that you know
[03:21:54.890 --> 03:21:58.970]  They do a lot of data collection on the competition and royal gold was uh,
[03:21:59.450 --> 03:22:05.450]  Involved with that and so you can start to see also the difference in the growing
[03:22:05.610 --> 03:22:10.490]  You know if people are growing the same cultivar in this soil and that the soil used
[03:22:11.130 --> 03:22:18.570]  Goes with that producer information on the um, you know, and and people can also here's the thing that's important
[03:22:18.570 --> 03:22:22.810]  I think we highlight is that people could share as much or as little as they want, you know
[03:22:22.890 --> 03:22:26.490]  Because some of the things are ip that you don't want to share publicly
[03:22:26.730 --> 03:22:28.890]  But there are things that you maybe do want to share
[03:22:28.970 --> 03:22:34.170]  so it's kind of this platform will allow people to share as much or as little as they want and
[03:22:34.570 --> 03:22:36.410]  Something fun like that is like, you know
[03:22:36.410 --> 03:22:39.850]  It's like if your secret sauce is that you use royal gold soil soil
[03:22:39.930 --> 03:22:43.210]  Then maybe you don't want people to know that that's your secret sauce
[03:22:43.210 --> 03:22:46.730]  so you you have the ability to hide that piece of data or
[03:22:47.370 --> 03:22:53.310]  If you want to share that and be like look look at how our results compared to this result are so incredible
[03:22:53.930 --> 03:22:59.930]  And I think that um, it's just going to help take us forward because of post prohibition era thinking
[03:23:00.650 --> 03:23:05.130]  With the science and all of that. We're still kind of stuck in this zone. We're still learning about the plant
[03:23:05.130 --> 03:23:07.610]  We're still learning about what works best. So
[03:23:08.330 --> 03:23:13.770]  It is a great platform for any ancillary business that wants to come even is going to really
[03:23:14.250 --> 03:23:19.210]  Um, like christian said it's it's a free protocol that is going to be able for people to use
[03:23:19.850 --> 03:23:22.250]  To help plug and play together all that we do
[03:23:23.370 --> 03:23:25.930]  Well, thank you so much to both of you for really
[03:23:26.650 --> 03:23:32.730]  Kind of opening my eyes to a lot of the depth of this concept. I really am so so very interested
[03:23:33.450 --> 03:23:38.510]  Thank you so much, I really truly appreciate it. Well, thanks for having us. It's an ongoing conversation
[03:23:39.290 --> 03:23:43.370]  Appreciate that. We lost michael. How did we lose michael?
[03:23:45.610 --> 03:23:51.530]  Thank you you guys, you know and I and I appreciate that you said it's it's more than just genetics because
[03:23:51.850 --> 03:23:57.050]  When I look at our regions michael, I see ip like you said your soil
[03:23:57.690 --> 03:24:02.730]  How you make your product how you water your product it even end up becoming
[03:24:03.210 --> 03:24:10.570]  Part of your ip in this process and I think that's where our jewels are is in all that experience because that's what we have
[03:24:11.210 --> 03:24:16.010]  More than most other places in the world is a lot of experience with this plant
[03:24:18.410 --> 03:24:24.090]  Yeah, the storytelling of that is key and I think that's the missing link is like all this legacy story that we have
[03:24:24.650 --> 03:24:28.490]  And also the appellation piece and all of these different things like what it's it's how
[03:24:28.890 --> 03:24:36.090]  The technology is going to help us showcase what sets these different areas and different genetics and different growers apart
[03:24:36.490 --> 03:24:41.050]  And how you know the previous speaker when he was speaking about, you know, the organic grown
[03:24:41.370 --> 03:24:49.070]  It's like how do we really start to educate people and this platform is going to help us to really educate. Um the end consumers
[03:24:49.850 --> 03:24:50.890]  right, so
[03:24:50.970 --> 03:24:56.730]  In in tying back to that like so essentially they can document. Oh these hugel beds were built in
[03:24:57.750 --> 03:24:59.750]  1997 or 2002 or whatever
[03:25:00.330 --> 03:25:02.570]  this is the hugel bed and this is the
[03:25:03.130 --> 03:25:09.690]  20 years of work that went into developing the biome that produced this individual jar of cannabis
[03:25:10.410 --> 03:25:11.290]  Yep
[03:25:11.290 --> 03:25:13.450]  And here's our beautiful soil tests or you know
[03:25:13.450 --> 03:25:19.770]  Here are the things and and same thing though people can provide as much or as little information as they want in one nation
[03:25:19.770 --> 03:25:22.010]  And they own their own data. So it's not that sort of thing
[03:25:22.010 --> 03:25:26.010]  But if there are things that you don't want to share, I just definitely want to reiterate that that's
[03:25:26.570 --> 03:25:30.650]  You know, it's up to you what you want to share so we can advance this for everybody
[03:25:31.050 --> 03:25:32.890]  You know, I think is a big part of that too
[03:25:32.890 --> 03:25:38.250]  What allows them to monetize and market those items in another way and that's really important too
[03:25:38.330 --> 03:25:43.290]  So you can keep this private or you can say oh, hey if you'd like to join our network
[03:25:43.690 --> 03:25:46.570]  Then we can provide you more and more information
[03:25:46.650 --> 03:25:50.490]  If you want to support us as a farm to be out here producing this in this way
[03:25:50.490 --> 03:25:54.890]  So it's available at your local dispensary. We're losing money on every pound
[03:25:55.850 --> 03:26:02.830]  Yeah, buy in for five dollars a year as a subscription to have all of this data at your fingertips
[03:26:03.610 --> 03:26:05.290]  whereas, you know
[03:26:05.290 --> 03:26:11.450]  Random person who just buys it off the street doesn't get that but it allows them to monetize in a way that is not
[03:26:11.830 --> 03:26:17.690]  Monetizing the cannabis so they're not paying the cannabis taxes. They're not paying the registration cost
[03:26:18.010 --> 03:26:21.070]  This is a separate stream of subscription as a marketing
[03:26:21.850 --> 03:26:26.330]  To bring in an alternate revenue fund if they want to use their data in that way
[03:26:26.330 --> 03:26:31.450]  But they have the data to document and protect right michael. You just nailed it
[03:26:33.290 --> 03:26:35.290]  Data is a new product
[03:26:35.930 --> 03:26:39.130]  Right and today's a product we don't value much
[03:26:39.770 --> 03:26:46.970]  Because the state forces us to give much away right but then it's stuck in place. Nobody can see it. Anyway, so it's lost
[03:26:47.530 --> 03:26:48.570]  and
[03:26:48.570 --> 03:26:52.730]  There's no way to monetize it right because how do you know how do you sell it?
[03:26:52.970 --> 03:26:57.150]  The monetization is important. And again, this is where cryptocurrency technologies
[03:26:57.930 --> 03:27:03.610]  Are built for this so our data is becoming a separate product from the product
[03:27:03.850 --> 03:27:08.650]  So when I buy the package I scan the code. I see the farm that grew the product
[03:27:09.130 --> 03:27:15.050]  I could say oh wow. Thank you farmer tip the farmer 50 cents or five bucks. I don't know
[03:27:15.690 --> 03:27:20.890]  Yeah, and and you know cryptocurrency do this super easy. This is not even hard to do anymore
[03:27:21.370 --> 03:27:24.570]  So we just need to show people how to do it and that's what we're doing
[03:27:24.970 --> 03:27:29.050]  Well, it's putting the power back into the little guy's hand the bezos's of the world
[03:27:29.130 --> 03:27:33.610]  These people are doing this now and that's how they're amassing unprecedented wealth
[03:27:34.090 --> 03:27:39.370]  And how the little man who's out here creating this data and information can't get a dime of it
[03:27:39.850 --> 03:27:46.910]  So I i'm just again. Thank you for really opening my eyes to these concepts. I didn't understand at all before this conversation
[03:27:52.330 --> 03:27:55.450]  And it really is like I just want to say quickly that I really want
[03:27:56.490 --> 03:27:58.810]  that passion piece of it is really to bring
[03:27:59.530 --> 03:28:02.410]  um attention to some of the places that really have
[03:28:02.730 --> 03:28:08.250]  Fallen by the wayside and I think that all of the work that people have done for so long with breeding these magical
[03:28:08.730 --> 03:28:15.130]  um cultivars and we have all of these incredible varieties and that it really um
[03:28:16.490 --> 03:28:19.690]  I I really want to see a way that that can
[03:28:20.570 --> 03:28:25.290]  We can hold that in the future because there are a lot of other outside influences coming in
[03:28:25.770 --> 03:28:27.770]  And I think that the more um
[03:28:27.850 --> 03:28:31.130]  the more we're able to stand together as a group and also show
[03:28:31.770 --> 03:28:39.210]  that these things have have history and have story and actually aren't just you know, I I have my own concerns around um,
[03:28:39.610 --> 03:28:44.650]  other larger groups coming in and kind of controlling certain parts of the genetic, um,
[03:28:45.530 --> 03:28:48.190]  resources and that we have so there's definitely
[03:28:49.130 --> 03:28:53.770]  um, there's like a passion here to make sure this project works and I think that um,
[03:28:53.930 --> 03:28:58.170]  I think that it will serve everybody and hopefully other plants beyond cannabis
[03:28:58.650 --> 03:29:02.570]  And fungi or other things along the way too. The whole division is large
[03:29:03.130 --> 03:29:06.330]  Once we get this styled, so thank you. Thank you. Evian
[03:29:06.410 --> 03:29:12.570]  Well next we have joey burger and tamra coming up who are living that passion
[03:29:12.810 --> 03:29:14.810]  Thank you both of you for coming on
[03:29:15.210 --> 03:29:21.470]  Um, I think we we accomplished a lot with michael understanding all of that. It's pretty mind-blowing
[03:29:22.030 --> 03:29:24.510]  Isn't it it is really is
[03:29:25.150 --> 03:29:30.830]  It's just and I it's wonderful. It's wonderful to be able to know that we can really protect ourselves
[03:29:30.990 --> 03:29:32.990]  And that there's a new market that we can build
[03:29:33.550 --> 03:29:35.550]  You know, it's all about find the workaround
[03:29:36.190 --> 03:29:37.070]  Um, all right
[03:29:37.070 --> 03:29:44.030]  I'm gonna put on a quick video and then we're gonna have I think adelia and joey and tamra up talking about
[03:29:44.250 --> 03:29:45.870]  Regenerative farming
[03:29:45.870 --> 03:29:47.870]  Thank you. Lilania. Thank you
[03:29:48.830 --> 03:29:54.670]  To those days and to see where it's come to now where there's all these folks coming in from everywhere
[03:29:55.310 --> 03:29:58.350]  popping up greenies and establishing their businesses and
[03:29:58.830 --> 03:30:01.950]  You know choosing the strains and getting them out there and making them popular
[03:30:02.030 --> 03:30:06.430]  It's like on some level I feel like it's kind of gotten out of our hands that way for sure
[03:30:06.910 --> 03:30:11.630]  They'll never take away from the history here because you can't right but I mean
[03:30:12.190 --> 03:30:15.230]  Corporate america is doing its best to hone in on us
[03:30:15.950 --> 03:30:18.910]  You know and and the money that's involved with it, right?
[03:30:18.910 --> 03:30:22.350]  and but that's where our culture is at right now is they're not they haven't dealt with a
[03:30:22.590 --> 03:30:26.430]  Culture like us and the fight that we've had to do and it's like when we moved to humble
[03:30:27.390 --> 03:30:28.830]  We weren't born here
[03:30:28.830 --> 03:30:33.790]  But we chose to like stick a flag up and tell them to fuck off and we'll fight camp and grow weed
[03:30:34.190 --> 03:30:38.910]  And on the hillside in the metol valley or wherever the fuck we want. Like you said, you know, they would come every day
[03:30:39.310 --> 03:30:43.710]  Um helicopters and they would stop at four o'clock or five o'clock and go home
[03:30:43.870 --> 03:30:46.510]  And then they'd come back to the exact same spot
[03:30:50.350 --> 03:30:52.590]  Hello welcome, thank you
[03:30:53.150 --> 03:30:56.670]  Uh, thank you. Joey and is it tomorrow or tamra?
[03:30:57.290 --> 03:30:58.270]  tomorrow
[03:30:58.270 --> 03:31:03.230]  Tomorrow perfect. All right. Welcome. Thank you both so much for taking the time this sunday
[03:31:03.790 --> 03:31:09.010]  And um, you know before we get started in the questions, can you both just share a little bit about yourselves?
[03:31:10.750 --> 03:31:12.510]  Sure
[03:31:12.510 --> 03:31:16.670]  My name is billy burger, um known in the community as the humboldt local
[03:31:17.230 --> 03:31:23.150]  Though I did just move to lake county about a month ago. I lived in southern humboldt all of my life. Um,
[03:31:24.190 --> 03:31:26.190]  Been in cannabis since I was a young kid
[03:31:27.230 --> 03:31:30.830]  Touched every part of it and these days i'm doing a lot of teaching
[03:31:31.550 --> 03:31:35.390]  Alongside my partner tamara here. We host a lot of workshops and camps
[03:31:35.950 --> 03:31:39.310]  um sharing our background in permaculture and natural farming
[03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:44.270]  And um, yeah really excited to be sharing with you guys today some of the
[03:31:45.150 --> 03:31:52.350]  Uh issues we see cause causing these fires and some of the solutions we see. Um, yeah excited to be here
[03:31:52.350 --> 03:31:53.710]  Thanks you guys
[03:31:53.710 --> 03:31:54.830]  Yeah
[03:31:54.830 --> 03:32:00.190]  And i'm tamara thorn and um, i'm the owner and founder of kill by self gardens
[03:32:00.910 --> 03:32:08.110]  Um, i've been out in middletown for about or in lake county for about 11 years now growing cannabis and herbs
[03:32:08.430 --> 03:32:12.830]  And I do a lot of products with the um herbs and the cannabis we grow
[03:32:13.790 --> 03:32:19.730]  And before that I traveled around the country and in mexico. We taught environmental education
[03:32:20.510 --> 03:32:24.350]  And I used to do wolfie work trade and I learned about a lot of farming
[03:32:24.750 --> 03:32:31.230]  different methods from all the different farms I went to and then right before I came here I took a permaculture class and just really
[03:32:31.550 --> 03:32:33.310]  Dive deep and
[03:32:33.310 --> 03:32:35.970]  into this whole realm of growing
[03:32:36.450 --> 03:32:40.130]  And also just figuring out how to live a sustainable life
[03:32:40.930 --> 03:32:42.050]  and
[03:32:42.050 --> 03:32:43.570]  Yeah
[03:32:43.570 --> 03:32:48.770]  Thank you both for that. Um, you know those that are tuning in because we have a a wide
[03:32:49.490 --> 03:32:52.770]  Range of audience members through all the platforms that we're streaming
[03:32:53.090 --> 03:32:57.170]  Some may be in cannabis some may not some may be in states that don't have any
[03:32:57.570 --> 03:33:03.970]  Uh, you know much insight around cannabis just yet or they're just you know more on the medical side of things just starting up
[03:33:04.370 --> 03:33:07.270]  So what is regenerative farming
[03:33:09.490 --> 03:33:15.970]  Well regenerative farming is really the ancient way of farming this is how all farming was up until the uh,
[03:33:16.770 --> 03:33:21.250]  The advent of the chemical industrial agriculture model that we see now
[03:33:22.690 --> 03:33:26.370]  Uh regenerative farming is farming in ways that don't harm the earth
[03:33:27.250 --> 03:33:29.330]  Whose practices generate life?
[03:33:30.050 --> 03:33:34.550]  They don't deplete soil they don't deplete the biology in the soil they generate these systems
[03:33:35.410 --> 03:33:37.410]  um, it's how our our
[03:33:37.650 --> 03:33:43.650]  Our ancestors farmed this way for eons largely largely using animal manures and their own manures
[03:33:44.290 --> 03:33:50.850]  um, so regenerative farming is really a way of closing those loops looking at your land looking at the resources around you
[03:33:51.490 --> 03:33:58.690]  And figuring out how can you harness those powers those plant allies and make your own fertilizers build that biology in your soil?
[03:33:59.330 --> 03:34:03.670]  You know, how do we look at nature and mimic these systems that we see in nature that work so seamlessly?
[03:34:04.690 --> 03:34:05.570]  um
[03:34:05.570 --> 03:34:08.290]  How do we bring those onto our farm onto our farms?
[03:34:09.890 --> 03:34:14.210]  The question should have probably been more on uh, you know those that are unfamiliar with farming
[03:34:15.810 --> 03:34:20.770]  I think I should have rephrased that on my end, but you know, that was exactly the the question it was still the same
[03:34:21.250 --> 03:34:23.490]  um, you know with that component
[03:34:24.130 --> 03:34:29.250]  Um, the next question was going to be what are the benefits and you kind of went through that already with just answering
[03:34:29.250 --> 03:34:30.930]  What is regenerative farming?
[03:34:30.930 --> 03:34:36.530]  Um, you know, one of the things I was researching when I was looking up the humboldt local is that you both um,
[03:34:36.930 --> 03:34:40.930]  You were mentioning host, uh educational events and I saw a
[03:34:41.970 --> 03:34:48.290]  Region region camp. What is that? And are you hosting that now? Can people come and take those and join that now?
[03:34:49.250 --> 03:34:54.210]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, we have our next um events coming up. This is april 7th
[03:34:55.010 --> 03:35:02.210]  uh, easter weekend weekend and we're going to be stepping people through a lot of different, um techniques on how to
[03:35:03.170 --> 03:35:06.930]  Grow either cannabis or their vegetables. Hello, whatever you want to grow
[03:35:07.490 --> 03:35:16.130]  Using like everything that's around you like i'm teaching some um the jadam liquid fertilizer where it's like you're just taking plants around your garden
[03:35:16.370 --> 03:35:21.090]  And being able to use those for your fertilizers and like what that means
[03:35:21.410 --> 03:35:25.030]  We're also talking a lot into the how you create your own microbials
[03:35:25.570 --> 03:35:29.890]  Um into your garden and use your indigenous microorganisms. That's there
[03:35:30.530 --> 03:35:36.770]  And so we're we're doing some of those talks and how to make um seed blocks and biochar
[03:35:37.330 --> 03:35:39.330]  and um
[03:35:39.330 --> 03:35:41.330]  What else are we going into? We're
[03:35:41.570 --> 03:35:43.570]  What else are we going into we're
[03:35:44.370 --> 03:35:51.490]  Deep. Yeah, we're kind of going deep into like what all the things that we use during the year to have a successful season
[03:35:52.050 --> 03:35:53.250]  and um
[03:35:53.250 --> 03:35:59.810]  Some of our favorite things to show are just so simple too where it's literally you're taking some plants like let's say I want to do
[03:36:00.210 --> 03:36:01.170]  um
[03:36:01.170 --> 03:36:07.650]  A a really good veg tea and so i'm going to go out and go grab a lot of alfalfa grass
[03:36:08.050 --> 03:36:15.330]  Or some of nettles horsetail and put those in a bucket or a 50 gallon barrel i'm going to fill it with water
[03:36:15.490 --> 03:36:18.210]  I'm going to add some leaf mold in that and boom
[03:36:18.530 --> 03:36:24.290]  There is my veg for the year and then also you want to go into the transition and you're looking at
[03:36:24.930 --> 03:36:26.370]  um your
[03:36:26.370 --> 03:36:32.930]  Some of your fruit your unripe fruit your unripe blackberries your unripe apples or something like that and you can do the same thing
[03:36:33.490 --> 03:36:35.170]  then you're going into
[03:36:35.170 --> 03:36:39.970]  Fruiting or blooming time and so then you're going to have your ripe fruits your flowers
[03:36:40.210 --> 03:36:44.770]  You're gathering up all of these anything that kind of relates to what's going on at that time
[03:36:45.410 --> 03:36:51.250]  And yeah, and so you're using those you're putting your leaf mold in and you're getting way higher nutrients
[03:36:51.250 --> 03:36:54.530]  Than you would if you just went to the grocery store and you're looking at this
[03:36:55.170 --> 03:36:59.170]  Clear liquid stuff that you're like, is this really gonna feed my plant or soil?
[03:36:59.730 --> 03:37:07.890]  But the stuff that we're making yes, yes it is and so those are some of our fun things we're gonna be going over and how to
[03:37:08.370 --> 03:37:10.370]  Really get your own microbial
[03:37:10.850 --> 03:37:15.650]  From your land and learn how to brew them up and then feed it back into your soil
[03:37:16.610 --> 03:37:22.050]  That sounds like a great weekend. And if anybody wanted to sign up for this, how could they do so?
[03:37:23.250 --> 03:37:25.250]  You can go to tinyurl.com
[03:37:25.730 --> 03:37:27.250]  Tinyurl.com
[03:37:27.250 --> 03:37:33.250]  Regencamp4 or you can look on facebook for regen camp with Joey Berger and Tamora Thorne
[03:37:34.850 --> 03:37:39.570]  Check our instagrams the humble local 2.0 and heel underscore thyself gardens
[03:37:40.770 --> 03:37:47.970]  Yeah, they've been really fun events. We ran a couple of them last summer and they're a full day at natural farming intensive
[03:37:48.370 --> 03:37:54.610]  We're basically going to teach you in one day how to farm if you were to wash up on a deserted island with no growth store
[03:37:55.410 --> 03:37:58.610]  and how you harness these plants all around you because
[03:37:59.410 --> 03:38:02.850]  That's how nature farms and that's how our ancestors farmed and
[03:38:04.210 --> 03:38:08.050]  You know, we need to be knowledgeable in that that's something that is important
[03:38:08.050 --> 03:38:11.810]  You never know what's going to happen tomorrow and we need those those tools
[03:38:12.370 --> 03:38:15.410]  You know, I think people you know, even if their phone goes out, you know
[03:38:16.050 --> 03:38:16.850]  um
[03:38:16.850 --> 03:38:22.530]  But one of the important questions that we wanted to really touch on is with regenerative farming
[03:38:22.610 --> 03:38:26.370]  You know, how can you utilize your land to help create defensible space?
[03:38:27.970 --> 03:38:29.650]  Yeah, absolutely
[03:38:29.650 --> 03:38:34.770]  Well, you know one of the things we want to talk about is when we talk about regenerative agriculture
[03:38:34.930 --> 03:38:39.090]  We talk about permaculture. We talk about natural farming. What we're really talking about is
[03:38:39.790 --> 03:38:41.790]  indigenous knowledge
[03:38:41.870 --> 03:38:47.890]  rebranded and repackaged indigenous teachings that our ancestors, uh, you know left behind for us
[03:38:48.610 --> 03:38:54.370]  And uh, you know, I just moved down here from humble from southern humble, uh from some wailaki land
[03:38:55.010 --> 03:39:00.290]  And the wailaki's they were nomadic people. They moved from the ridge down to the creek depending on the season
[03:39:00.930 --> 03:39:02.930]  and they
[03:39:03.650 --> 03:39:08.930]  They they viewed what was happening in the forest and they saw that after the lightning came and the fires came that
[03:39:09.250 --> 03:39:11.810]  The acorns on the trees were healthier
[03:39:12.370 --> 03:39:15.810]  And they realized that they started doing control burnings every few years
[03:39:15.810 --> 03:39:19.170]  So the acorn was their main food source that the oaks were healthier
[03:39:19.490 --> 03:39:24.850]  That the pests and the parasites living in the in the downed acorns was um, wasn't as bad
[03:39:25.090 --> 03:39:28.930]  So every few years they would burn certain areas of the of the land there
[03:39:29.410 --> 03:39:33.570]  And this would lead to it would it would it would burn away the young, uh,
[03:39:33.810 --> 03:39:40.530]  Fir trees or the successional species who overgrow the oak trees and replace oak trees. They wanted a healthy, um food forest
[03:39:40.530 --> 03:39:45.170]  They managed it as a food forest and by doing that burning there was more berries
[03:39:45.250 --> 03:39:51.170]  There was more smaller bushes and shrubs because the light could reach the forest floor and you would get more of those early
[03:39:51.470 --> 03:39:57.910]  Successional species and so you would end up with more food. You would end up with more animals a more diverse ecosystem
[03:39:58.770 --> 03:40:01.650]  um healthier stronger diverse ecosystem, so
[03:40:02.450 --> 03:40:06.530]  We need to look to this ancient knowledge. We need to look to our ancestors. Um
[03:40:07.330 --> 03:40:09.890]  We can't just do the burning that they used to do
[03:40:10.530 --> 03:40:13.970]  Because we have some really settled set settlements here now
[03:40:14.530 --> 03:40:20.210]  Um, but we can do a lot of um control burning in the winter in the winter months
[03:40:20.770 --> 03:40:23.570]  Uh, especially in our grassy lands our open fields
[03:40:24.450 --> 03:40:31.250]  There's a lot of this happening in southern humboldt over this last winter. There's a lot of control burning happening. So we're happy to see that
[03:40:32.130 --> 03:40:33.490]  um
[03:40:33.490 --> 03:40:38.770]  And yeah, we've got to get into these forests because these forests have been overgrown for the last hundred years
[03:40:39.010 --> 03:40:40.930]  Um, they they should have been thinned out now
[03:40:40.930 --> 03:40:43.810]  We have an overgrown forest filled with fuel and fire loads
[03:40:44.290 --> 03:40:48.690]  And so we go into these properties and we look at different ways. We can use those. Um,
[03:40:49.490 --> 03:40:55.830]  Those as resources. How do we turn these waste these dangerous waste streams into valuable resource streams?
[03:40:56.530 --> 03:41:00.850]  So we're going to talk about some of the ways we do that and you probably heard some of this today
[03:41:00.930 --> 03:41:04.870]  But the biggest one we we use this this wood forest hugelkultur
[03:41:05.590 --> 03:41:09.670]  Hugelkultur is where um, but first off let me just say I just messed up on the dates
[03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:15.510]  The date for our camp is april 15th 16th and 17th. The actual day is the 16th
[03:41:16.150 --> 03:41:18.150]  i'm coming
[03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:19.910]  But the hugelkultur
[03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:23.830]  Um, it's where you're going in and you're burying a lot of wood and you're putting um
[03:41:24.390 --> 03:41:27.590]  Different layers on that and then covering that back up with soil
[03:41:28.150 --> 03:41:31.830]  And so and there's different ways to do it like at my place
[03:41:31.830 --> 03:41:35.590]  I'm on a lot of rock like heavy serpentine where you go down
[03:41:36.390 --> 03:41:44.470]  Not even an inch and there's just rock and so and I also have a lot of um, coniferas a lot of um,
[03:41:45.270 --> 03:41:49.990]  Just like pine trees and stuff up and down my roads and things that are just all dead and brushed
[03:41:49.990 --> 03:41:56.150]  So this last year what I did is I widened our roads and so all of the wood that we use
[03:41:56.230 --> 03:41:58.230]  We went ahead and we cut it down
[03:41:58.230 --> 03:42:02.390]  And we had to do it that deep usually you do not do it that deep but there was many purposes
[03:42:02.390 --> 03:42:06.470]  I wanted to do that with is like one of them is that it's on a hillside
[03:42:06.710 --> 03:42:13.590]  So as the water comes down, it's going to really sink it and so hugelkultur is when you do dig down it creates
[03:42:14.150 --> 03:42:19.910]  You're slowing your water. You're doing a permaculture technique where you're like you're slowing your stream
[03:42:20.470 --> 03:42:22.710]  You're slowing your stream and you're not even digging
[03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:28.570]  You're slowing your water you're doing a permaculture technique where you're like you're slowing you're spreading
[03:42:29.110 --> 03:42:33.830]  And you're sinking the water and then that makes the water table go up higher
[03:42:34.390 --> 03:42:39.430]  And then all of that wood and everything that we cleaned up around the roads and around the gardens
[03:42:39.510 --> 03:42:45.610]  We just buried it we put it down in there and then on top. We just put a bunch of horse manure goat manure alfalfa
[03:42:46.470 --> 03:42:50.090]  Um all kinds of things I kind of had just ready to go old cannabis
[03:42:50.490 --> 03:42:55.610]  Um a lot of things from the garden and then put the soil back on top
[03:42:55.930 --> 03:42:58.970]  And so all that's been like marinating and that's what the hugel is
[03:42:59.050 --> 03:43:02.330]  It's like it's just really burying all of that wood
[03:43:02.970 --> 03:43:05.050]  and creating um life with it
[03:43:07.210 --> 03:43:12.250]  Yeah, and but then there's also other ways to do it where you can do it directly on top of your soil
[03:43:12.650 --> 03:43:16.250]  And then you just laying out the wood and then you you put soil over on that
[03:43:16.410 --> 03:43:22.970]  So it kind of depends on what environments you have but the pupils you can do them anywhere and it's just really great
[03:43:23.370 --> 03:43:25.950]  Thing that you can do with all this wood that you're collecting
[03:43:26.650 --> 03:43:31.850]  From your forests and it just breaks down so fast too. And it's like oh you gotta use more
[03:43:31.930 --> 03:43:36.810]  Oh, look, here's another place that people can go and it just kind of keeps going and it's fun
[03:43:37.930 --> 03:43:44.570]  That's one of the ways we use. Um the wood right now and uh, then other things is building you talked about your
[03:43:45.210 --> 03:43:50.590]  Building you've been doing yeah, certainly different types of wood can be used in natural building projects
[03:43:51.770 --> 03:43:54.810]  We're doing a lot of thinning on tomorrow's farm right now
[03:43:55.930 --> 03:43:57.930]  smaller poles poles that are in the
[03:43:58.410 --> 03:44:04.410]  Six to three inch range we're cutting those out and we're using those to build fences what's called junk pole fence
[03:44:04.810 --> 03:44:10.570]  Which is a very simple fence invented by a permaculturist named paul wheaton up in montana
[03:44:10.570 --> 03:44:13.210]  Where they have a lot of these junk poles from the pine beetle
[03:44:13.770 --> 03:44:18.890]  Destroying the pine forest up there. So they actually get paid to go in and fit out those poles here
[03:44:18.890 --> 03:44:24.330]  We're we're paying ourselves in creating that defensible space. We're stacking options by taking that
[03:44:25.370 --> 03:44:31.690]  That that dangerous wood out and using it to build a fence a very simple fence here and rabbit fence that you can use
[03:44:31.770 --> 03:44:33.770]  minimal fasteners with
[03:44:33.770 --> 03:44:40.010]  Um pretty cool resource. So there's also lots of other things you can do, you know, you can do round pole timber framing
[03:44:40.330 --> 03:44:42.810]  There's lots of different things you can do with that lumber
[03:44:43.130 --> 03:44:48.330]  Certainly hugel culture is one of the best great way to build soil build the microbials near soil
[03:44:48.890 --> 03:44:49.690]  um
[03:44:49.690 --> 03:44:52.650]  That that wood as it breaks down it acts as a sponge
[03:44:52.730 --> 03:44:58.330]  So it's absorbing what what what rainfall you do get when you build them on a contour flat across the hill
[03:44:58.730 --> 03:45:00.730]  All that water is going to hit it and soak in
[03:45:01.290 --> 03:45:04.650]  And then as that wood is also breaking down it's generating heat
[03:45:04.810 --> 03:45:09.770]  So you'll be able to plant earlier it extends your growth season. You can harvest later plant earlier
[03:45:10.330 --> 03:45:14.010]  Um, if you build it with a steep walls on it steep
[03:45:14.310 --> 03:45:20.810]  Mounted side you can end up with more square footage than you would with just a flat flat garden many many benefits to it
[03:45:21.290 --> 03:45:23.290]  Yeah
[03:45:25.930 --> 03:45:30.330]  Like, you know if things are more shade loving or if they're more sun loving you get to play with that
[03:45:31.770 --> 03:45:33.530]  Really cool
[03:45:33.530 --> 03:45:35.930]  So I had a quick question in that really quick
[03:45:36.650 --> 03:45:44.250]  Uh with that, you know as as you're incorporating these how how quickly does the soil start to re like to to
[03:45:44.730 --> 03:45:49.210]  To accept this new process that it's you know becoming or how do you how long does it take to get the better?
[03:45:49.290 --> 03:45:52.650]  This the new soil that is coming so that it's easier to start growing
[03:45:53.130 --> 03:45:56.330]  Is that a long process? Does it obviously not happen right away?
[03:45:56.330 --> 03:46:00.090]  But is that months or like years after you do the work that you guys are doing?
[03:46:00.810 --> 03:46:06.330]  Well, depending on what you build it out of is going to and the size and the shape is going to depend on how long
[03:46:06.330 --> 03:46:09.130]  It's going to take to break down. Um, we build these
[03:46:09.690 --> 03:46:13.770]  Depending on the context these ones we build to tomorrow's these will last decades
[03:46:14.490 --> 03:46:18.090]  Um, they're they're in a trench that's six eight feet wide and six feet deep
[03:46:18.490 --> 03:46:22.730]  With a couple feet of manure on top of it and a couple feet of top soil on top of that
[03:46:23.370 --> 03:46:26.990]  Um, her kids will be harvesting veggies out of these and maybe her grandkids
[03:46:27.870 --> 03:46:30.750]  Um, I do a lot of consulting on farms in humboldt
[03:46:30.910 --> 03:46:34.910]  We built an acre of googles in southern humboldt the farm we call googleville
[03:46:35.550 --> 03:46:37.550]  Where we're hosting our next regen camp
[03:46:38.030 --> 03:46:41.470]  And um a lot of that was fresh wood that we were cutting, you know
[03:46:41.550 --> 03:46:47.470]  We were cutting dead and down stuff, but we went on six neighboring properties and cleared fire cleared defensible space
[03:46:48.110 --> 03:46:51.470]  But a lot of that was there was some fresh wood. There was some dead wood
[03:46:52.430 --> 03:46:54.510]  Clearing along the roads clearing around buildings
[03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:59.630]  And so when you're using fresh wood, it's going to take longer for that wood to break down and it's going to lock up more
[03:46:59.690 --> 03:47:06.510]  Nitrogen during that process. So those beds we knew we needed to do a bigger nitrogen layer. There's a carbon layer
[03:47:06.750 --> 03:47:10.110]  There's a nitrogen layer and then you've got your top soil on top of that
[03:47:10.750 --> 03:47:14.830]  So knowing that this was their first year and they were going to grow cannabis in it
[03:47:14.910 --> 03:47:18.110]  We started that project in january and they were planting in may and june
[03:47:18.830 --> 03:47:20.190]  um
[03:47:20.190 --> 03:47:25.550]  We laid on a thick layer of chicken manure and alfalfa and some different nitrogens
[03:47:25.630 --> 03:47:30.910]  So they were able to grow a really rock and killer crop in a first year of google
[03:47:31.390 --> 03:47:36.590]  Knowing that this this you know this plant this crop they're getting ready to plant this year now that it's had a good winter
[03:47:36.830 --> 03:47:40.030]  You know not a ton of rain, but certainly november and december were pretty good
[03:47:40.430 --> 03:47:46.270]  It's uh, all that has been broken down. It's starting to break down. It all got watered last summer
[03:47:46.270 --> 03:47:49.490]  So the decomposed decomposition process has already begun
[03:47:50.190 --> 03:47:55.390]  There's a lot of different factors there, but you can build small googles, you know, three feet wide couple feet tall
[03:47:55.470 --> 03:48:00.110]  Just for some little solid greens. You can build them huge, you know, like we're talking the big, you know
[03:48:00.110 --> 03:48:02.110]  We build them with heavy equipment excavators
[03:48:02.750 --> 03:48:06.210]  Um all depends on your context. What are the materials you have available?
[03:48:07.070 --> 03:48:12.110]  It starts breaking down, you know really fast and like really it's like every year it's just going to get better
[03:48:12.430 --> 03:48:17.390]  But if you do it right you can plant that first year and you're still going to have a nice crop
[03:48:18.190 --> 03:48:24.350]  And they get better with age tomorrow's on her third year with some of her googles at her place in her crop last year
[03:48:26.590 --> 03:48:29.890]  On year three you're really going to start seeing some incredible
[03:48:30.510 --> 03:48:32.090]  um incredible
[03:48:32.090 --> 03:48:33.230]  changes
[03:48:33.230 --> 03:48:38.030]  And as the biological levels build in these soils your water use can go down
[03:48:38.190 --> 03:48:42.350]  This can also lead to more water puncture rate healthy soils require less water
[03:48:43.230 --> 03:48:48.930]  Um, you know when you have high biological levels in there you have the bacteria and the fungi these are your smallest microbes
[03:48:50.270 --> 03:48:56.350]  These excrete these, you know, these excretions that pull soil particles together and increase. Um
[03:48:57.070 --> 03:49:01.310]  can increase uh drain can increase airflow in the soils and
[03:49:02.750 --> 03:49:06.430]  So as these biological levels go up in your soil, that's what healthy soil is
[03:49:06.510 --> 03:49:08.670]  That's the difference between dead dirt and healthy soil
[03:49:09.230 --> 03:49:14.350]  So those are some of the things we teach how to really increase that biology in your soil so you can feed less because
[03:49:14.670 --> 03:49:19.390]  Healthy biological soils don't need fertilizer the microbes in that doing the work
[03:49:20.110 --> 03:49:24.830]  Um, so when you've got healthy soil, you can feed less you can water less
[03:49:25.950 --> 03:49:30.030]  the one issue they did have at googleville last year is they were over watering because
[03:49:30.350 --> 03:49:33.310]  They're used to we converted a half acre of smart pots
[03:49:33.790 --> 03:49:37.550]  Fabric pot to an acre of google. They're used to watering watering watering
[03:49:37.950 --> 03:49:42.830]  You know if you're in fabric pots, you're using a lot more water and your biologicals are not going to be a lot
[03:49:42.910 --> 03:49:45.310]  You're gonna have to feed microbes. We got dead soil
[03:49:45.870 --> 03:49:50.430]  Um, this is a big thing in regard to farming. How do we get those roots into the soil?
[03:49:50.750 --> 03:49:53.710]  How do we get that soil covered with deep layers of mulch?
[03:49:54.910 --> 03:50:01.950]  These are these are the things that keep your biological levels happy and your plants healthy and your water usage way down
[03:50:02.270 --> 03:50:07.150]  Fertilizer usage way down more money staying in the farmer's pocket. That's a really good people
[03:50:08.030 --> 03:50:11.790]  And it sounds like you all have the tool or the way that you teach people
[03:50:12.270 --> 03:50:17.150]  It is also affordable you have ways it can be very affordable in the process
[03:50:17.230 --> 03:50:23.150]  You're utilizing what's around you and or what's on your neighbors, you know helping them out too by utilizing their extra
[03:50:23.870 --> 03:50:24.830]  dried
[03:50:24.830 --> 03:50:26.830]  Plants or trees or whatnot, right?
[03:50:27.470 --> 03:50:35.230]  Mm-hmm most definitely. Yeah, that's one of the our favorite things to like show people is like I actually have
[03:50:35.550 --> 03:50:40.910]  Some receipts from like years ago when I first started growing and they're like fifteen thousand dollars
[03:50:41.470 --> 03:50:48.190]  And compared to where i'm at now where it's like a couple hundred, you know, i'm buying apple cider vinegar
[03:50:48.590 --> 03:50:54.270]  I'm buying, you know, just like maybe i'm going and hunting down some 50 gallon barrels, you know
[03:50:54.430 --> 03:50:56.430]  It's just so minimal
[03:50:56.430 --> 03:51:02.690]  And that's really fun to show people and how especially right now when we're all struggling in the cannabis industry
[03:51:03.070 --> 03:51:06.830]  And just in life right now. I think it's just a lot of change going on
[03:51:07.230 --> 03:51:11.890]  To know that you don't need to go to the grocery. You don't need to rely on that fertilizer
[03:51:12.670 --> 03:51:14.830]  That is now not coming in from russia
[03:51:14.910 --> 03:51:19.470]  But they're saying that we're going to have a problem this year in the middle of our country with growing food
[03:51:19.790 --> 03:51:22.770]  Because there's no fertilizer and we're like there's fertilizer
[03:51:23.310 --> 03:51:25.310]  Everywhere like everywhere
[03:51:25.810 --> 03:51:31.490]  Some of my favorite things like I hunt down spots like where who has the best nettle who's got the horsetail?
[03:51:32.050 --> 03:51:37.810]  You know these once you start understanding like the different things that the constituents inside the plants
[03:51:38.210 --> 03:51:41.590]  Is it you know, does it have more phosphorus? Does it have more potassium?
[03:51:42.130 --> 03:51:46.370]  then you can start going and gathering those and hunting them down and
[03:51:47.250 --> 03:51:49.250]  That's usually right around you too
[03:51:49.570 --> 03:51:52.390]  And the same thing with like your pesticide
[03:51:52.850 --> 03:51:59.890]  We don't buy pesticides we make our own and that's the same thing with other plants like i've got ton of juniper on my
[03:52:00.690 --> 03:52:08.050]  property so I harvest a lot of juniper a lot of bay leaves and then you boil that for like five hours and
[03:52:08.050 --> 03:52:10.050]  Then you're left with this super
[03:52:10.350 --> 03:52:17.570]  concentrated um liquid and then you combine that with like a um a soap what we call a jwa is like a
[03:52:17.890 --> 03:52:24.530]  Dong wedding agent, but you can also find a biological liquid soap to also use with it
[03:52:24.530 --> 03:52:26.930]  It's just cheaper learning to make it yourself
[03:52:27.410 --> 03:52:32.770]  But you add those two together and that will knock out I think I'm listening to us just you have come across
[03:52:33.090 --> 03:52:35.410]  Like that's like that's like my superpowered weapon
[03:52:35.890 --> 03:52:40.210]  Like I don't care. I'm like, okay, let's do it. Let's try out this new like herbal solution
[03:52:40.290 --> 03:52:46.210]  I made you know, and it's yeah, it's really cool to have that like in the back pocket going
[03:52:47.970 --> 03:52:54.370]  So much knowledge you guys you both have thank you for that and go ahead about teaching this stuff. It's all very simple
[03:52:54.530 --> 03:52:58.770]  There's nothing that we teach. It's difficult. You're really going to be able to learn this in a day and
[03:52:59.490 --> 03:53:05.250]  You know, that's why that's why we love this stuff because you can go home and see these results and none of it's difficult
[03:53:05.330 --> 03:53:07.330]  It's all simple. So yeah
[03:53:07.330 --> 03:53:08.130]  Hey
[03:53:08.130 --> 03:53:12.290]  Joey and tamra. We have a few people asking about google culture
[03:53:12.530 --> 03:53:17.090]  Yeah, can you explain it maybe spell it let people know because there's some questions
[03:53:17.730 --> 03:53:18.850]  Yeah
[03:53:18.850 --> 03:53:19.490]  All right
[03:53:19.490 --> 03:53:23.650]  It's it's got a strange spelling because it's a german word google actually means hill
[03:53:23.650 --> 03:53:28.530]  It's a hill culture because it's got this hill shape to it. It's h-u-g-e-l
[03:53:29.090 --> 03:53:32.690]  k-u-l-t-u-r google culture
[03:53:35.490 --> 03:53:37.490]  Yeah, we're not expecting that
[03:53:37.490 --> 03:53:39.490]  Not expecting that way
[03:53:40.130 --> 03:53:46.050]  We we credit it with uh coming from germany, but really this type of farming is done all over the world
[03:53:46.450 --> 03:53:48.870]  They do this in the tropics. They do this in south america
[03:53:49.410 --> 03:53:52.850]  Um, just there those types of materials break down much sooner
[03:53:53.650 --> 03:53:57.090]  Google might only last you three years, but that's fine. It's breaking down
[03:53:57.090 --> 03:54:02.130]  You're getting killer soil building building soil is not usually the problem in the uh in the jungle
[03:54:03.570 --> 03:54:04.610]  um
[03:54:04.610 --> 03:54:09.970]  What is a common question or maybe not even a question but just feedback, you know after they go through your camp
[03:54:10.530 --> 03:54:16.930]  And they're they're leaving or they reply back to you. What are their their thoughts after that experience of learning all this from you all?
[03:54:18.450 --> 03:54:23.490]  Just how simple it is how they um, you know, you really realize how much money, uh,
[03:54:23.730 --> 03:54:25.970]  you spent on this stuff over the years and
[03:54:26.610 --> 03:54:32.850]  You know, we were all really preyed on by these, you know by this industry that developed around the cannabis industry
[03:54:33.490 --> 03:54:38.470]  That uh really didn't doesn't have a place here anymore and really doesn't have a place in agriculture
[03:54:39.250 --> 03:54:41.970]  Um, we need to get back to these indigenous ways, you know
[03:54:42.530 --> 03:54:46.690]  We're being brainwashed to think that most of the world's food is being produced by big ag
[03:54:46.690 --> 03:54:51.090]  But only about a third of it is most of the world's food is still being provided by small farmers
[03:54:51.810 --> 03:54:54.930]  um who are still working the land with hand tools
[03:54:55.490 --> 03:55:00.370]  So we got to get we got to realize that's still the majority of what's going on around the world and we can provide a
[03:55:00.370 --> 03:55:05.090]  Lot of our own food and we should be providing all our own food. That is not below us at this point
[03:55:05.330 --> 03:55:08.770]  I hope these last two years really help people open up that that is wealth
[03:55:09.330 --> 03:55:13.410]  Health and that is wealth when that grocery store shuts down and if you're a cannabis grower
[03:55:13.410 --> 03:55:16.130]  What happens when that growth store shuts down party's over?
[03:55:16.850 --> 03:55:22.850]  How are you going to provide your own food your own medicine? So this indigenous knowledge is there. We're just rediscovering it
[03:55:23.490 --> 03:55:28.610]  Um, we don't like to teach just any one dogma. We want every tool in our toolbox
[03:55:28.690 --> 03:55:33.650]  So we teach permaculture. We teach free natural farming. We teach a dog. We teach living soil we
[03:55:34.190 --> 03:55:41.490]  Biodynamics biodynamics. We will use anything that we feel is easy simple to learn if it's too difficult the farmer's not going to do it
[03:55:41.490 --> 03:55:45.810]  Yeah, so we take the easiest techniques possible and we dumb them down even more
[03:55:46.050 --> 03:55:51.010]  Yeah, we really try to put it into late like very late turns and i'm like you see this bucket
[03:55:51.570 --> 03:55:54.050]  See this girl. Let's do it, you know and like
[03:55:54.690 --> 03:56:00.370]  Help like it's from the feedback I get too is empowering, you know people feel empowered and that's how I feel too
[03:56:00.450 --> 03:56:06.850]  It's just like knowing that if there's a pest problem or that you're seeing that your plants are calcium deficient
[03:56:07.010 --> 03:56:10.130]  But there's something that you can go whip up and within 24 hours
[03:56:10.210 --> 03:56:13.650]  You can have like that problem underway of getting taken care of
[03:56:14.130 --> 03:56:19.650]  and so that's that's a big one I get back the feedback is the empowerment of that and like going in the
[03:56:19.710 --> 03:56:26.050]  Excitement people are like really excited to do their gardens again, and that's really fun, especially like I have a neighbor
[03:56:26.130 --> 03:56:31.650]  We're helping right now with his garden. He's like he's been doing it for over 20 years and now he's like i'm excited to grow
[03:56:31.710 --> 03:56:33.710]  cannabis again, you know and
[03:56:34.210 --> 03:56:42.130]  Yes, getting people excited about their property and they're actually hiking it looking for plants, you know that it's people excited
[03:56:42.370 --> 03:56:44.370]  You're just like really there
[03:56:44.450 --> 03:56:52.450]  And in tune with nature, it's not funny you really need to remember that we are part of and um, yeah
[03:56:53.890 --> 03:56:58.930]  No, I love this and I I think this is again so much insight and i'm seeing some conversations
[03:56:58.930 --> 03:57:04.610]  They're saying such a wealth of information. So I think everybody's resonating and and again those that are tuning in
[03:57:05.090 --> 03:57:08.850]  um, you can experience this at their camp and you said it was uh,
[03:57:08.850 --> 03:57:11.970]  The 4 the 16th or the 15th through the 17th
[03:57:12.530 --> 03:57:16.210]  16th is the main day of camp, but we got a three days of events
[03:57:16.290 --> 03:57:22.450]  You can come just for a half day too. So yeah, it's april 15th 16th and 17th and it's reaching camp
[03:57:22.850 --> 03:57:24.130]  Yeah, we're having a big party
[03:57:24.130 --> 03:57:29.410]  You're gonna come that night before you can come and camp and we're gonna do a movie or some music
[03:57:29.650 --> 03:57:34.530]  The next day we're gonna wake up have a really good breakfast do our really intensive camp
[03:57:34.610 --> 03:57:41.890]  But then at night we're gonna have some other dragonfly earth medicine certified farmers talking about, you know, just different ways
[03:57:42.450 --> 03:57:45.970]  That we can do things in our farms and with the way that they do
[03:57:46.610 --> 03:57:52.370]  their different closed loop systems and then we're gonna end it with some more music and
[03:57:53.410 --> 03:57:55.410]  party on
[03:57:57.010 --> 03:58:02.610]  Yeah, and then this day we're going to do a kid and adult easter egg hunt so
[03:58:03.090 --> 03:58:05.090]  We're yeah, we're kind of excited for that
[03:58:06.050 --> 03:58:08.770]  i'm gonna get to yoga in the morning, so
[03:58:09.650 --> 03:58:15.810]  Yeah, you guys make sure that you put the link to the event in the chat somewhere
[03:58:16.050 --> 03:58:20.050]  So people can like click right into it. That would be amazing
[03:58:22.050 --> 03:58:24.050]  Thank you
[03:58:25.170 --> 03:58:26.770]  And joey for
[03:58:26.770 --> 03:58:34.530]  Sharing your wisdoms with us. I i'm excited that we got so much response that people are interested in this
[03:58:35.170 --> 03:58:41.650]  and the way you two explained it was so beautiful because it really was that this is just the way nature works and
[03:58:42.290 --> 03:58:49.730]  You know, this is how we we we regenerate the earth instead of keep taking from the earth
[03:58:49.890 --> 03:58:52.130]  So thank you so much for that
[03:58:52.850 --> 03:58:56.690]  Appreciate it you guys i i'm hoping to get down and see you for it
[03:58:58.850 --> 03:59:03.890]  All right, well, yeah, well we are now going into the live studio
[03:59:04.770 --> 03:59:05.570]  at
[03:59:05.570 --> 03:59:12.210]  Redwood royal grown and we've got rob who we've been running around doing these things with for a little bit
[03:59:12.290 --> 03:59:14.770]  He's a core part of the humble grace community
[03:59:15.650 --> 03:59:18.850]  um, and there we are. Hi guys
[03:59:19.410 --> 03:59:21.410]  Hello
[03:59:21.490 --> 03:59:28.290]  Sequoia and I are headed over that way and we're going to be there right around when daniel shows up I think
[03:59:28.690 --> 03:59:36.050]  Oh, you can't do that. He's already here. We've got the the birthday boy and entourage already on site. We're getting started. So
[03:59:36.530 --> 03:59:43.250]  Ah, well cat's gonna take over production for me so I we can come over and hang out. We'll see you guys soon
[03:59:43.890 --> 03:59:46.690]  Wonderful. See you soon. Good to see you rob. Welcome
[03:59:47.570 --> 03:59:51.570]  Hey, how's it going good to see you too lately good i'll see you in person in a bit
[03:59:52.210 --> 03:59:54.210]  all right, so
[03:59:54.370 --> 03:59:56.610]  i'm super excited to be sitting here with
[03:59:57.410 --> 04:00:03.090]  Longtime friend gasp rob go lightly who's been involved in all sorts of projects over the years
[04:00:03.570 --> 04:00:08.930]  in humboldt from the very beginning of 215 legislation and legalization all the way through
[04:00:09.730 --> 04:00:11.730]  to being currently active in
[04:00:12.450 --> 04:00:17.090]  The top level of getting the laws passed and getting the community's voices heard
[04:00:17.650 --> 04:00:22.610]  In the laws as best we can which obviously is sometimes a challenge. So
[04:00:23.410 --> 04:00:24.610]  You know
[04:00:24.610 --> 04:00:28.690]  We're supposed to talk about the journey through legalization, but we have like 10 minutes. So
[04:00:29.570 --> 04:00:33.090]  How how to tie the community aspect in the legalization journey?
[04:00:34.770 --> 04:00:36.770]  In rapid form
[04:00:37.090 --> 04:00:38.130]  Form
[04:00:38.130 --> 04:00:42.210]  Go, you know. Well, I think it'd be like a community shout out
[04:00:42.290 --> 04:00:46.930]  We should all read the new regulations just got dropped a few days ago. Oh, wow
[04:00:46.930 --> 04:00:49.010]  so that would be like the starting point of uh,
[04:00:49.490 --> 04:00:52.690]  Kind of where we're at right now with where we're going to go in the future
[04:00:52.770 --> 04:00:57.170]  and so I haven't actually read the new regs since they came out but um
[04:00:57.730 --> 04:01:02.610]  It's time to get cracking. It's time to get cracking definitely and I think there's definitely some things that uh
[04:01:04.130 --> 04:01:06.130]  That I know they're going to loosen up. Uh
[04:01:06.450 --> 04:01:10.290]  and not be as strict about transportation and different things, uh, but
[04:01:11.250 --> 04:01:14.690]  What's this there? And now's the time people are trying to figure it out as
[04:01:15.250 --> 04:01:17.650]  You know, it was being mentioned a lot of times earlier
[04:01:17.730 --> 04:01:19.730]  There are a lot of people that aren't planting this year
[04:01:19.970 --> 04:01:24.290]  a lot of people that are still not sure if they're planting this year trinity county is
[04:01:25.010 --> 04:01:26.370]  in mayhem
[04:01:26.370 --> 04:01:27.970]  currently, so
[04:01:27.970 --> 04:01:31.970]  You know, there's a lot going on. I think it's really important. Yeah to get up to date because
[04:01:32.530 --> 04:01:35.330]  If it just dropped two days ago, none of us know what's happening yet
[04:01:35.810 --> 04:01:40.210]  Yeah, a lot of people are definitely not growing from a distribution standpoint. We talked to
[04:01:40.930 --> 04:01:43.510]  Farmers and we have a nursery also and definitely
[04:01:44.210 --> 04:01:46.850]  Are not getting the same amount of orders as we did last year
[04:01:47.490 --> 04:01:50.690]  And prior and so definitely people are putting the brakes on I think
[04:01:51.250 --> 04:01:56.610]  a lot of people are just going to grow less amounts to and uh, just higher qualities, but
[04:01:57.170 --> 04:01:59.170]  definitely, they'll they'll still be a
[04:01:59.650 --> 04:02:01.810]  a lot of people doing it. Yeah, and
[04:02:01.810 --> 04:02:07.010]  And I guess one of the big questions i've had throughout all these conversations is
[04:02:08.290 --> 04:02:12.690]  When somebody decides not to plant are they still responsible for that full canopy tax?
[04:02:13.730 --> 04:02:18.210]  Well in in humboldt you're allowed to go fallow. I think they call it and then yeah, you're allowed to
[04:02:18.450 --> 04:02:21.890]  You're allowed to zero out your square footage as long as you don't grow on your property
[04:02:22.370 --> 04:02:23.730]  You don't have to pay the tax
[04:02:23.730 --> 04:02:29.250]  You do have to stay current with the state license and that might be something in the regs that have recently changed
[04:02:29.330 --> 04:02:31.730]  I know that they were trying to get the state to
[04:02:32.430 --> 04:02:37.010]  Acknowledge not charging farmers for years that they take off out of the regulated market
[04:02:37.330 --> 04:02:40.370]  yeah, because it was a big big fear-based thing where if you
[04:02:40.610 --> 04:02:42.850]  You know took a year off or decided not to pay you
[04:02:43.170 --> 04:02:50.050]  You basically forfeit your license and have to go through the process completely again, right? Yeah at first that was the case and
[04:02:50.850 --> 04:02:55.010]  uh, that was the one of the first amendments to measure s was definitely
[04:02:55.730 --> 04:02:57.730]  at first they were going to make people just
[04:02:58.050 --> 04:03:00.530]  Pay the tax even if they didn't do it. Wow
[04:03:01.250 --> 04:03:03.650]  So definitely get up to date on these new
[04:03:04.530 --> 04:03:06.370]  regs, but like
[04:03:06.370 --> 04:03:13.810]  Looking back. I think it's important for people at home to recognize how much community involvement went into getting the regs to where they are
[04:03:14.210 --> 04:03:15.730]  through the years
[04:03:15.730 --> 04:03:16.850]  so
[04:03:16.850 --> 04:03:18.850]  what are some of the
[04:03:18.990 --> 04:03:21.970]  Community people that you've been working with over the last
[04:03:22.610 --> 04:03:26.530]  You know 15 years really negotiating this whole track to get us
[04:03:27.250 --> 04:03:31.250]  To where we are today. Well this last group of regs. We basically just
[04:03:32.370 --> 04:03:39.090]  Were able to at our company at the distribution just a stone's throw away from here. Um,
[04:03:39.810 --> 04:03:41.570]  we were able to uh
[04:03:41.570 --> 04:03:46.290]  Come up with as a company and we just created a bunch of complaints against things that weren't working for
[04:03:46.610 --> 04:03:50.530]  different businesses things that we hear on the street things that taxes we we
[04:03:50.930 --> 04:03:55.330]  We we really pointed out to them how the taxes were. We had a corporate. Uh
[04:03:56.690 --> 04:04:01.590]  Or they called it an executive walkthrough and we actually met the head of the department of cannabis control
[04:04:02.050 --> 04:04:06.850]  And so we were we printed out a bunch of these things with all our complaints in our letter to them
[04:04:07.090 --> 04:04:09.090]  And handed it out to them
[04:04:09.090 --> 04:04:12.630]  And they were definitely something they said they would use in the future regulations
[04:04:13.650 --> 04:04:14.690]  Wow
[04:04:14.690 --> 04:04:18.210]  Again getting involved makes a difference speaking up email
[04:04:18.290 --> 04:04:24.690]  I mean they say that they they listen to people's emails and so really like the first complaint should be an email to
[04:04:25.410 --> 04:04:27.410]  The dcc
[04:04:27.570 --> 04:04:29.730]  If you have a problem if something's not working
[04:04:30.450 --> 04:04:31.810]  Tell him
[04:04:31.810 --> 04:04:38.770]  Yeah, I mean and that's how this community was created was being vocal and you know, that's how 215 came into place
[04:04:39.490 --> 04:04:44.450]  right and the early days is all about being vocal and getting involved and
[04:04:45.090 --> 04:04:47.090]  not shying away from it and
[04:04:47.330 --> 04:04:50.450]  you know, we talked about this in the interview before that it's
[04:04:50.850 --> 04:04:54.130]  Happening all over where new laws are going through in new places and people aren't
[04:04:54.770 --> 04:04:57.010]  Coming out from the shadows because they're afraid
[04:04:57.810 --> 04:04:59.810]  Like get out there say something
[04:04:59.890 --> 04:05:04.630]  Shape the law. Yeah, when I when I actually collected signatures for proposition 215
[04:05:05.490 --> 04:05:07.490]  um or before that even um
[04:05:08.370 --> 04:05:13.810]  80 of the people that you would ask your more would like cuss at you or tell you you're crazy and just
[04:05:14.450 --> 04:05:16.770]  Refuse to even hear what you were talking about
[04:05:17.330 --> 04:05:19.330]  You know back in the 90s
[04:05:19.490 --> 04:05:26.210]  And uh, yeah, it's crazy how much things have changed and now like psychoactives are trending and becoming legal
[04:05:27.250 --> 04:05:32.770]  You know 30 years ago. We were we were deemed crazy because we were telling people this plant was medicine
[04:05:33.490 --> 04:05:36.210]  And uh, you know, it's obviously medicine
[04:05:37.170 --> 04:05:39.170]  Yeah, it's really not crazy
[04:05:39.570 --> 04:05:45.090]  No, it truly is and that's one thing that I think a lot of the conversations throughout the day and a lot of the people
[04:05:45.730 --> 04:05:47.730]  from all aspects of
[04:05:47.970 --> 04:05:53.810]  The community that we've spoken with from tech from technology to farming it's you know
[04:05:55.090 --> 04:05:59.490]  It's it's all about that intent, you know, yeah, definitely. Yeah
[04:06:00.210 --> 04:06:06.210]  Yeah, the lineup today is very impressive. It's it's killer to come up with like a revolutionary person like joey who's uh,
[04:06:06.770 --> 04:06:10.770]  figured out this way for farmers to survive if they follow that path and
[04:06:11.570 --> 04:06:17.010]  All the work he did with the trim scene solutions and being revolutionary in the whole extraction scene
[04:06:18.370 --> 04:06:21.810]  Yeah, they had a bunch of good guests on there. Yeah, it's been really
[04:06:22.530 --> 04:06:26.450]  amazing for me to watch I learned so much about regenerative farming. It's something I
[04:06:27.330 --> 04:06:28.930]  look into and
[04:06:28.930 --> 04:06:32.690]  I'm active in every day and somewhere another trying to do it in my yard or
[04:06:33.230 --> 04:06:36.690]  integrate concepts and the products we're developing at royal gold, but
[04:06:37.410 --> 04:06:40.450]  I still learn from the people that were here today
[04:06:41.170 --> 04:06:43.170]  In real time. It's pretty amazing
[04:06:43.570 --> 04:06:50.290]  Definitely so and that's I guess part of the journey through legalization that has really
[04:06:52.450 --> 04:06:55.970]  Changed so much lately is now all of this stuff that got passed around
[04:06:56.690 --> 04:07:00.790]  Among cannabis growers in private on hillsides is now being elevated
[04:07:01.490 --> 04:07:03.650]  You know a lot of these are ancient techniques
[04:07:03.650 --> 04:07:09.670]  There are things that people were doing at cannabis farms for the last 30 40 years that weren't widespread
[04:07:10.390 --> 04:07:16.630]  And now we're talking about these regenerative farming techniques that people have been using in these hills and it's really elevated that
[04:07:17.430 --> 04:07:19.590]  piece of agriculture in a huge way
[04:07:20.070 --> 04:07:23.270]  Yeah, it's funny you say that because when I started growing when I was a kid
[04:07:23.910 --> 04:07:25.670]  We had to make our own
[04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:29.750]  Dirt and soil in the holes that we were growing in and so we and you know, we were making
[04:07:30.390 --> 04:07:36.710]  I guess the agitated teas they call them now. Yeah, um 35 years ago to make nutrients ourselves, right?
[04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:41.110]  And when we were a little kid we learned how to make uh, and we would make basically sun teas
[04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:44.250]  And and use those as our nutrients
[04:07:45.270 --> 04:07:49.430]  Yeah, and those are the things that like the research into well, why is this working?
[04:07:50.390 --> 04:07:56.070]  And then it's it's funny though the way that we you know went all into hydroponic growing and then went through all these different
[04:07:56.630 --> 04:08:01.590]  Chemical procedures and then organic nutrient procedures and bottles and then came back to this
[04:08:02.150 --> 04:08:06.950]  This way now that well we can do it all naturally every if you have a good piece of property
[04:08:07.430 --> 04:08:10.310]  um and a huge biodiversity you can like
[04:08:11.190 --> 04:08:13.830]  Use all the inputs from your land to grow all your herbs
[04:08:13.990 --> 04:08:20.470]  So you really don't even need to truck nutrients or anything into your property if you have the right right space to do it
[04:08:20.630 --> 04:08:24.470]  Right, and you can use these techniques to make your property more fire safe
[04:08:24.550 --> 04:08:29.190]  Which is you know being that we're on the humble grace fire auction right now, which
[04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:32.310]  This is coming to an end get in there and make sure to
[04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:38.470]  Bid on your items. There's so many amazing things on the auction. Don't forget to go check in on that
[04:08:39.510 --> 04:08:40.710]  um
[04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:42.470]  but there
[04:08:42.470 --> 04:08:47.990]  There's just so much going on and building for resiliency in our communities and that's one way
[04:08:48.630 --> 04:08:50.390]  to capture water
[04:08:50.390 --> 04:08:56.870]  To utilize the organic matter in an effective way to get it out of you know, your home out of fire danger a little bit
[04:08:57.350 --> 04:08:58.470]  Yeah
[04:08:58.470 --> 04:09:05.610]  Yeah, I think one way of survival for farmers right now is to to look into getting fire grants for your property and for your neighborhoods
[04:09:06.390 --> 04:09:08.390]  and look into
[04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:13.990]  You know, they pay you to do the work and so the government will pay you to do fire retention and fire safety programs
[04:09:14.550 --> 04:09:21.910]  And so we can easily be working and getting grant money and doing side projects off our properties right now and be getting funded like
[04:09:22.550 --> 04:09:27.750]  Some of the biggest funding in california through grants is going to be for fire retention safety
[04:09:28.150 --> 04:09:31.110]  And so farmers don't jump on that and become involved with
[04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:34.790]  Um that kind of thing during the winter times in the down months
[04:09:36.550 --> 04:09:39.030]  They're missing out on some monies that are that are available
[04:09:39.350 --> 04:09:44.550]  Yeah, we spoke with jeremy brown one of the trinity county board of supervisors and he was saying the same thing get out there and
[04:09:44.550 --> 04:09:48.550]  look at what's available to you because there's things that while it is
[04:09:49.350 --> 04:09:52.310]  Under the concept of you know fire prevention and all this
[04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:55.910]  It's going to help your farm. It's going to help make you more cost effective
[04:09:55.990 --> 04:09:59.350]  It's going to help make your farm a better place and why not?
[04:09:59.830 --> 04:10:05.690]  Take advantage to build the community in such an excellent way and get that government money. That's been allocated
[04:10:06.230 --> 04:10:11.190]  For people like you to do these things. It's grants. It's using our tax money that we pay on it. So
[04:10:11.750 --> 04:10:13.750]  if grants are
[04:10:13.990 --> 04:10:19.190]  Utilized in your industry you're lucky to be able to catch that money because it helps you uh,
[04:10:19.830 --> 04:10:23.030]  It helps you on paying taxes, too. Like it does so
[04:10:23.910 --> 04:10:27.190]  You know ways to get tax incentives too by doing these things
[04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:32.630]  Well, not so important right now is so many farmers are yeah going fallow and struggling
[04:10:32.710 --> 04:10:35.290]  But we still want to continue to work on their properties
[04:10:36.150 --> 04:10:38.230]  And you know build for the future
[04:10:39.350 --> 04:10:41.590]  These are ways that you can make that a little
[04:10:42.310 --> 04:10:44.310]  Less painful, right?
[04:10:44.790 --> 04:10:46.710]  Wow
[04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:47.910]  well
[04:10:47.910 --> 04:10:50.070]  We've gone through at least 10 minutes of this
[04:10:50.870 --> 04:10:56.150]  You know journey of legalization to tie back to regenerative. I know lele's coming in
[04:10:56.710 --> 04:11:01.430]  Lele's coming in so i'm stepping in for a second while she's journeying over there and the journey to
[04:11:01.730 --> 04:11:04.950]  Legalization is a lot longer than 10 minutes. So you did a great job
[04:11:05.910 --> 04:11:13.590]  Um, I believe adelia is going to come in and uh bring up uh review some of the auction items and where we are
[04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:18.790]  So, thank you so much rob
[04:11:18.790 --> 04:11:20.790]  And michael we'll see you in a second
[04:11:21.350 --> 04:11:22.870]  Thank you
[04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:26.870]  All right. Um, yes, we're gonna chat a little bit about the auction
[04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:31.830]  So I have been watching the ticker and it is still going up, which is good
[04:11:32.310 --> 04:11:36.150]  I've been bidding. I don't know about you, but i've been bidding and I think i've already been outfitted
[04:11:36.950 --> 04:11:39.910]  Oh, oh, yeah, keep going back to those bids
[04:11:40.310 --> 04:11:42.630]  Um, I wanted to chat about a couple new items
[04:11:42.630 --> 04:11:45.670]  Well, not new items, but a couple new items that I saw as I was scrolling
[04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:51.350]  I don't know if you saw it cat. Did you see that custom designed water and smell proof bag and skateboard set?
[04:11:52.310 --> 04:11:55.190]  No, I did not I was looking at the beauty products
[04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:59.830]  Are you okay? Okay. I'm gonna pull it up really quick. I just thought it was so interesting
[04:12:00.310 --> 04:12:04.070]  Um, you know, it just it's it has some good is it just let's see
[04:12:04.070 --> 04:12:06.550]  Oh, I think my screen just has to come up really quick
[04:12:08.390 --> 04:12:11.430]  Um, there we go
[04:12:13.430 --> 04:12:21.500]  Is it I don't know if it's named after mine can maybe not
[04:12:25.340 --> 04:12:27.340]  Not your head layla if you want in
[04:12:27.980 --> 04:12:35.420]  Uh, well so a little bit about that it's from barrett farms, uh, it's inspired by the beauty of humble humboldt county
[04:12:35.980 --> 04:12:37.100]  um
[04:12:37.100 --> 04:12:43.740]  And yeah, it was they have this design skateboard that has all this cool artwork even the smoke. Uh, the the the not smoke
[04:12:44.060 --> 04:12:47.660]  But even the uh, smell proof bag has a really cool design
[04:12:48.300 --> 04:12:51.900]  Um, and we have lots of trips. So another trip I found
[04:12:53.180 --> 04:12:56.460]  Wait, and yeah, have you been up to uh to humble yet?
[04:12:57.340 --> 04:13:00.860]  I have been to humboldt. I haven't been able to spend as much time as I would like
[04:13:00.940 --> 04:13:06.780]  I always go up there for emerald cup and uh, but it's it's I don't get to see as many of uh,
[04:13:07.260 --> 04:13:12.220]  My friend's farms as I would like to or or their home. So i'm definitely planning a trip
[04:13:12.380 --> 04:13:15.580]  They keep telling me I have to come visit so I can't wait to do that soon
[04:13:15.660 --> 04:13:20.780]  Yeah, well, I have not been up there. I'd love to visit so I'd love a place to stay when I visit
[04:13:22.140 --> 04:13:25.020]  And I'd love lots of tours of lots of farms. So there you go
[04:13:25.660 --> 04:13:30.860]  Putting it out there anybody listening will invite me and cat we'll we'll spend a week up there
[04:13:32.460 --> 04:13:35.980]  Uh, one other one was oh, sorry, go ahead. Yep. Go ahead
[04:13:36.860 --> 04:13:42.540]  Uh, so one other item I just wanted to touch on really quick about is there's also a one night stay at the carriage house
[04:13:42.940 --> 04:13:46.140]  uh, it also has a dinner for two at the
[04:13:46.760 --> 04:13:48.380]  igamar club
[04:13:48.380 --> 04:13:50.140]  um and that
[04:13:50.140 --> 04:13:57.340]  The venue just looks beautiful. It's a very old victorian house that looks very upkept and it's it looks just absolutely amazing
[04:13:57.500 --> 04:14:02.220]  So keep getting those bids in. Um, we are there's so much
[04:14:02.700 --> 04:14:08.860]  Yeah, and i'll say that we have links to the auction posted on the future cannabis projects youtube channel
[04:14:09.580 --> 04:14:14.540]  On humble grace's facebook and on the ethical data alliance's facebook page
[04:14:15.340 --> 04:14:17.340]  Perfect and if so
[04:14:18.060 --> 04:14:24.460]  I think it's video time. I'm going to show a couple clips. Yeah, and then we will wait for our next segment of breeders to
[04:14:24.540 --> 04:14:26.220]  load in
[04:14:26.220 --> 04:14:50.930]  I like the way that sounds
[04:15:10.570 --> 04:15:12.570]  Oh
[04:15:12.570 --> 04:15:14.570]  So
[04:15:43.280 --> 04:15:45.780]  The amount of dollars that are going to taxation
[04:15:46.420 --> 04:15:49.220]  And what the consumer is paying
[04:15:50.500 --> 04:15:52.500]  Those numbers just aren't in line
[04:15:52.660 --> 04:15:57.140]  totally, but I think across the board like getting over the stigma of cannabis and then
[04:15:57.700 --> 04:16:00.340]  Then being dangled with this huge amount of money
[04:16:01.040 --> 04:16:08.200]  Involved creates this complete shit show from state to state. There's no uniformity even from county to county or municipality to municipality
[04:16:08.740 --> 04:16:15.140]  Everybody's seeing dollar signs so different than what happened with alcohol prohibition where totally it was just lifted across the board
[04:16:15.300 --> 04:16:20.900]  And it opened up business to kind of operate pretty much the same, you know, unless there were certain areas
[04:16:20.900 --> 04:16:25.960]  Maybe you couldn't be open on a sunday, but pretty fucking minor when you're looking at it in comparison to cannabis
[04:16:27.700 --> 04:16:29.700]  Yeah, I did a party
[04:16:31.140 --> 04:16:33.140]  I bet he fell over the railing before
[04:16:35.140 --> 04:16:37.700]  All right, all right ladies, can you hear me
[04:16:39.860 --> 04:16:41.860]  Fuck
[04:16:45.140 --> 04:16:51.080]  Because we're here also, okay. Hey everybody
[04:16:54.980 --> 04:16:56.980]  Audio's on
[04:16:57.300 --> 04:16:59.300]  It is we're live again
[04:17:00.180 --> 04:17:06.260]  All right, everybody we're having a moment of technical difficulty. I think it might be my stream i'm gonna
[04:17:07.220 --> 04:17:08.180]  michael
[04:17:08.180 --> 04:17:10.180]  Ladies, did we lose you?
[04:17:19.070 --> 04:17:21.070]  But it says that we're not live
[04:17:22.110 --> 04:17:27.950]  Oh, there's I hear cat. Yeah, I I it's saying that the stream was shut down it looks
[04:17:34.430 --> 04:17:36.430]  No, I think you're here but

[04:17:58.910 --> 04:18:03.390]  Cat can you take over as admin i'm turning all your cameras on
[04:18:04.830 --> 04:18:09.230]  But it it keeps like every time I can't go live it shuts down again
[04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:13.950]  I think you're okay now. Nope. It keeps saying your live stream shut down
[04:18:14.190 --> 04:18:19.510]  Layla can you hear me?
[04:18:22.550 --> 04:18:29.120]  So i'm getting two messages i'm getting that it's shut down and i'm getting go live

[04:19:19.510 --> 04:19:28.480]  No, I gotta call layla, let me call you back
[04:19:31.200 --> 04:19:49.700]  I

[04:20:38.620 --> 04:20:41.420]  Yo, there's kevin, all right
[04:20:44.620 --> 04:20:47.660]  Hello kevin josh, can you guys hear us? Yeah
[04:20:47.660 --> 04:20:51.020]  Yeah, excellent. How about you big josh you hear him?
[04:20:56.920 --> 04:20:58.920]  We're live
[04:20:58.920 --> 04:21:03.600]  You muted josh
[04:21:04.160 --> 04:21:06.160]  We don't have josh audio, okay
[04:21:07.200 --> 04:21:09.200]  Well, welcome back everyone once again
[04:21:12.080 --> 04:21:14.080]  I'm michael back. Sorry for the
[04:21:14.240 --> 04:21:18.160]  Technical difficulties i'm joined right now by daniel hendrix
[04:21:19.040 --> 04:21:21.200]  kevin, jodri and josh stroud so
[04:21:21.760 --> 04:21:24.980]  Once we get these technical glitches the conversation will ensue
[04:21:26.160 --> 04:21:28.080]  but we're talking about
[04:21:28.080 --> 04:21:31.040]  basically genetics breeding and the future
[04:21:31.760 --> 04:21:35.760]  So that's a huge concept to cram into like 15 or 20 minutes. So
[04:21:37.600 --> 04:21:39.600]  I guess where do we even start gentlemen?
[04:21:41.520 --> 04:21:46.640]  Boy can go so many directions there, right future is kind of endless right now
[04:21:47.520 --> 04:21:52.240]  I love the the phase we're in right now. I feel it's like a hype train kind of phase
[04:21:52.640 --> 04:22:00.740]  There's a whole lot of like flashy perps. Um, okay everybody we are live. Thank you for your patience
[04:22:02.080 --> 04:22:03.680]  I cam
[04:22:03.680 --> 04:22:05.520]  Hey daniel
[04:22:05.520 --> 04:22:07.520]  joshua
[04:22:07.760 --> 04:22:08.720]  Hello
[04:22:08.720 --> 04:22:10.160]  Oh, I appreciate it
[04:22:10.160 --> 04:22:16.880]  One of the fun things about these projects is we always get to see how we fuck up and how we recover
[04:22:17.520 --> 04:22:20.400]  Um, because we're all learning digital media
[04:22:21.120 --> 04:22:22.320]  out here
[04:22:22.320 --> 04:22:28.800]  All right, i'm gonna get off camera and let the show continue on. Um coming up right now. We've got michael
[04:22:29.420 --> 04:22:30.560]  interviewing
[04:22:30.560 --> 04:22:32.560]  a couple of amazing men
[04:22:32.880 --> 04:22:38.320]  From the humboldt legacy project is how i'm connected to all of them and through community
[04:22:38.880 --> 04:22:46.400]  Um, but they're really gonna they're all into the plants in the sea which is really the beginning of this whole story
[04:22:47.120 --> 04:22:51.120]  Um, so I will get off and let michael take over. Thanks guys for coming on
[04:22:53.840 --> 04:23:00.000]  Yes, once again, so i'll run through the introductions a little bit daniel hendrix of hendrix nursery up in humboldt
[04:23:00.720 --> 04:23:03.040]  selling moving michael, we can't hear you
[04:23:04.160 --> 04:23:05.360]  Uh-oh
[04:23:05.360 --> 04:23:07.360]  You can't hear me
[04:23:08.800 --> 04:23:13.930]  Okay
[04:23:14.090 --> 04:23:16.090]  My mic shows live
[04:23:19.620 --> 04:23:21.620]  You're you're active on my end
[04:23:22.500 --> 04:23:24.500]  We can that was me
[04:23:25.140 --> 04:23:27.300]  Okay, good good good. All right
[04:23:28.020 --> 04:23:32.740]  So yeah, and kevin jodri who if you don't know kevin's breadth of work
[04:23:33.860 --> 04:23:40.120]  Look it up because he's it's too much to cram into this 10 minutes founder of wonderland nursery longtime influencer
[04:23:40.520 --> 04:23:48.360]  And active member of the cannabis community and humble and joshua stroud josh stroud who I have less history and knowledge of but
[04:23:49.800 --> 04:23:51.800]  Let's dig in to
[04:23:52.340 --> 04:23:55.000]  breeders breeding genetics in the future
[04:23:55.800 --> 04:23:56.920]  so
[04:23:56.920 --> 04:24:01.560]  You're saying it's kind of a flashy reality right now that that's where it's all hype
[04:24:01.720 --> 04:24:06.760]  Everybody wants the like flashiest purple but this and that that's what's dominating retail market, right?
[04:24:06.840 --> 04:24:11.720]  Yeah, I think a lot of people are going to instagram and you really can only see the weed there
[04:24:12.280 --> 04:24:14.680]  And that's just like such a narrow
[04:24:15.700 --> 04:24:21.560]  perspective of what you're getting from the plant which is like at least you can smell it too in reality, but
[04:24:22.280 --> 04:24:24.280]  You know, it's really about how it makes you feel
[04:24:24.840 --> 04:24:26.840]  And actually getting high
[04:24:26.920 --> 04:24:32.060]  So, I mean like if you go off what you think looks best on instagram, it doesn't feel very validated
[04:24:32.840 --> 04:24:36.120]  Yeah, you can't but it's a demographic though. You know what I mean?
[04:24:37.080 --> 04:24:40.520]  It's a demographic that goes because they like the way weed looks
[04:24:41.160 --> 04:24:42.200]  and
[04:24:42.200 --> 04:24:44.200]  What happens is we you kind of have?
[04:24:45.720 --> 04:24:52.440]  Judgment placed on where there's value in a thing and what I realize is the instagram group's the instagram group
[04:24:53.240 --> 04:24:57.880]  And it's just really what it is. It's but it's a segment of the market that you can't deny is real
[04:24:58.840 --> 04:25:00.840]  it's just that it's frustrating because
[04:25:01.240 --> 04:25:07.000]  Visual beauty doesn't really take you as many places as you want it to
[04:25:08.120 --> 04:25:13.320]  Yeah, I like to think it's a starting point for people appreciating one aspect of the cannabis and
[04:25:13.880 --> 04:25:19.800]  Will at least allow them to magnify into seeing the beauty of the other aspects and starting to take that journey
[04:25:20.680 --> 04:25:26.120]  But it is a limited profile. It just seems like it's narrowing to me right now
[04:25:26.680 --> 04:25:33.320]  You know, it's like the amount of work that's out there is abundant and the amount of expressions you see is like
[04:25:33.860 --> 04:25:37.240]  Completely truncated, you know over the last like five years
[04:25:37.800 --> 04:25:42.520]  So, you know, I think that there's you know a lot more to see in what the expression is, you know
[04:25:42.520 --> 04:25:45.960]  There's just so many more flavors and feelings you can get from it
[04:25:46.600 --> 04:25:48.760]  and then you know the future is like
[04:25:50.200 --> 04:25:55.720]  That's the past, you know all the different flavors and expressions is like almost the past future. I just think is
[04:25:56.360 --> 04:25:57.960]  endless it's all about
[04:25:57.960 --> 04:26:01.320]  this new ag, you know, it's a pretty competitive market and
[04:26:02.040 --> 04:26:08.440]  Seeing like what's going to survive like drought and stress tolerance and you know real expressions of the plant
[04:26:08.920 --> 04:26:15.080]  In a changing climate too. Yeah, and I and to be pessimistic the future is going to include all kinds of stuff, right?
[04:26:15.240 --> 04:26:17.240]  like everything from
[04:26:17.320 --> 04:26:18.420]  you know
[04:26:18.420 --> 04:26:20.420]  modified plants to
[04:26:20.900 --> 04:26:24.040]  Engineered, you know genes knockout genes
[04:26:24.920 --> 04:26:26.040]  I mean
[04:26:26.040 --> 04:26:28.040]  Wow, it's gonna be a lot right?
[04:26:28.200 --> 04:26:31.160]  Kevin, what's your take on that? I mean, you know, I know that you see
[04:26:32.120 --> 04:26:35.000]  You know all the different tools that are out there
[04:26:35.560 --> 04:26:39.480]  Uh, you know being a breeder and in the center of like nursery
[04:26:40.280 --> 04:26:41.720]  you know
[04:26:41.720 --> 04:26:44.360]  What's your take on that? You've seen all the tools that are out there
[04:26:45.480 --> 04:26:47.480]  yeah, you know the
[04:26:48.440 --> 04:26:51.580]  The the the beauty of cannabis is that it's complex
[04:26:51.820 --> 04:26:55.200]  And so that even if you have unbelievable
[04:26:56.140 --> 04:26:58.140]  uh, you know
[04:26:58.200 --> 04:27:05.100]  Ability and brilliant people. It still is an ungodly amount of work to really be able to lock down
[04:27:05.340 --> 04:27:07.100]  something in the gene
[04:27:07.100 --> 04:27:08.700]  itself
[04:27:08.700 --> 04:27:10.700]  And so I think that
[04:27:10.700 --> 04:27:12.700]  It's going to be a slower process
[04:27:13.900 --> 04:27:17.900]  Then you know, we we all feared but at the same time, you know
[04:27:17.980 --> 04:27:21.580]  What you're going to see is you're going to see some incredibly developed plants
[04:27:21.660 --> 04:27:26.460]  And and what I would really love to see is I would love to see things that get developed that are meant for
[04:27:27.340 --> 04:27:29.340]  people to license to use in breeding
[04:27:30.140 --> 04:27:36.860]  so that if I wanted to go do a project myself, I could license or pay for access to
[04:27:38.300 --> 04:27:40.300]  True parental stock
[04:27:40.300 --> 04:27:44.060]  That had uh, you know traits of interest noted and proven
[04:27:44.620 --> 04:27:46.220]  And so to me, you know
[04:27:46.220 --> 04:27:49.180]  What i'd love to see is i'd love to see the the home user
[04:27:49.580 --> 04:27:54.220]  Be able to benefit from the technology because all of us are in the in the industry. You know what I mean?
[04:27:55.180 --> 04:27:57.980]  And it that doesn't really mean anything to the people who buy pot
[04:27:58.220 --> 04:28:00.460]  They just want to know they're going to get better weed cheaper
[04:28:01.100 --> 04:28:03.600]  And and that's a pretty real that's a pretty real consideration
[04:28:04.140 --> 04:28:08.300]  But for for me, you know what I love to see is i'd love to see the science start to really put out
[04:28:08.860 --> 04:28:11.680]  some reliable plants that have some extremely
[04:28:11.900 --> 04:28:13.900]  Extremely
[04:28:13.980 --> 04:28:15.600]  Specific traits
[04:28:15.600 --> 04:28:18.640]  That you could license and use in your project so that you know
[04:28:18.880 --> 04:28:21.600]  What you have is you're creating the next wave of breeder
[04:28:22.080 --> 04:28:23.120]  of of
[04:28:23.120 --> 04:28:29.920]  Not so much breeder from scientific end of it, but from the emotional end of it who then goes forward into the scientific end
[04:28:30.880 --> 04:28:32.880]  Yeah, that's interesting
[04:28:33.200 --> 04:28:35.360]  So, you know that's putting it back into
[04:28:36.400 --> 04:28:37.360]  you know
[04:28:37.360 --> 04:28:43.680]  The garages some of what rob was saying earlier about giving the small guy an opportunity to develop
[04:28:44.320 --> 04:28:47.760]  something on a micro scale and really nuance it
[04:28:48.480 --> 04:28:50.560]  To actually compete in at the level
[04:28:51.120 --> 04:28:57.700]  That they need to against the big tag of big corporate breeding programs. Yeah. Yeah, I like it because it incentivizes
[04:28:58.320 --> 04:29:00.320]  the breeder because I think that
[04:29:00.560 --> 04:29:02.560]  It's definitely a place to be
[04:29:02.560 --> 04:29:04.560]  in advance and be improved
[04:29:04.880 --> 04:29:06.880]  i'm all for that, uh
[04:29:06.880 --> 04:29:08.880]  especially like in the small breeders
[04:29:09.440 --> 04:29:10.320]  like
[04:29:10.320 --> 04:29:13.780]  Really connecting to like something that's creative and unusual
[04:29:14.800 --> 04:29:15.680]  uh
[04:29:15.680 --> 04:29:20.880]  I definitely would love to see something that kind of connects to that small farmer story too, you know
[04:29:21.440 --> 04:29:26.880]  because there there are like, you know, you you and there are people that come from that perspective that are just the plant is
[04:29:28.160 --> 04:29:30.160]  Nobody can own it, right?
[04:29:30.320 --> 04:29:35.600]  Yeah, you know, so I think that there should like with the same thing like I think I I agree with kevin
[04:29:36.000 --> 04:29:41.760]  Uh, like wholeheartedly that like ip and cannabis is something worth recognizing to be licensed
[04:29:42.480 --> 04:29:46.080]  And I think that like on the other side we also need a creative comment
[04:29:46.560 --> 04:29:51.680]  Like hey, this is like a space of genetics that like people can pull from
[04:29:52.240 --> 04:29:57.600]  um for their own well-being and and health and because everybody probably
[04:29:58.160 --> 04:30:03.760]  Fought for their right for this plant like rob was just on probably everybody on this call
[04:30:04.320 --> 04:30:10.720]  You know, they we all believe that the plant should be accessible to everyone definitely pot's not one of those things where
[04:30:11.920 --> 04:30:18.960]  It you know the by smoking it you kind of like reject almost all like corporate everything just the moment you inhale
[04:30:19.180 --> 04:30:21.120]  anyways, so like
[04:30:21.120 --> 04:30:27.200]  It's a contradiction like big cannabis business. The whole thing is like an oxymoron. It's impossible
[04:30:27.760 --> 04:30:28.880]  Right it is
[04:30:28.880 --> 04:30:31.280]  But that's what's happening out there. It's so crazy
[04:30:31.440 --> 04:30:33.920]  And yeah, it's
[04:30:35.920 --> 04:30:38.160]  It's interesting to me to see
[04:30:39.600 --> 04:30:46.240]  This whole, you know humble legacy group and all of these blockchain ideas come together too because it allows us to look back and say
[04:30:46.320 --> 04:30:50.800]  Yeah, it needs to be common. It needs to be open like we got genetics out of bags
[04:30:51.360 --> 04:30:54.640]  Of weed as kids because it wasn't all sensitive, right?
[04:30:55.440 --> 04:30:58.880]  Almost no sensey and so you just got seeds and you played with it and it was
[04:30:59.440 --> 04:31:04.560]  Open source, you know everybody's right. Yeah, nobody wants to take that away, right?
[04:31:04.800 --> 04:31:07.360]  I think that's really important to note and then
[04:31:08.160 --> 04:31:10.160]  also, it is important to note that people that
[04:31:10.880 --> 04:31:13.040]  did that and collected genetics and
[04:31:13.820 --> 04:31:15.820]  meticulously crafted genetic
[04:31:16.060 --> 04:31:18.000]  compounds and
[04:31:18.000 --> 04:31:20.000]  25 years in the making. Yeah
[04:31:20.320 --> 04:31:26.080]  They've done the work and they should be able to protect that in some way and bring it to market also
[04:31:26.160 --> 04:31:28.480]  So it really is a difficult subject
[04:31:29.120 --> 04:31:32.800]  On how we're going to get to the future and allow both of those things to happen
[04:31:33.440 --> 04:31:39.920]  without one overshadowing the other, you know preventing the best genetics from being open source, but also
[04:31:41.280 --> 04:31:42.240]  you know
[04:31:42.240 --> 04:31:44.480]  preventing the people who create them from
[04:31:45.020 --> 04:31:50.640]  Valuing them in any way because otherwise, right? How do we move and what's the incentive to keep doing it?
[04:31:50.800 --> 04:31:53.040]  Right. I know and there's somebody else who's on the call
[04:31:53.120 --> 04:31:59.040]  We haven't talked to yet too and I was and just to invite the concept even further just you know
[04:32:00.000 --> 04:32:04.880]  We do start to recognize like cannabis is ip, you know, does that mean that like?
[04:32:06.000 --> 04:32:08.800]  you know not monsanto's the world are going to like
[04:32:09.600 --> 04:32:13.120]  Patent it with more powerful tools and kind of like usurp
[04:32:13.760 --> 04:32:15.860]  our like own, you know objectives
[04:32:17.040 --> 04:32:20.560]  You know, what's your take on cannabis ip? What do you think about it?
[04:32:20.960 --> 04:32:24.560]  Joshua it's hard to see you. I think that's why no it is
[04:32:25.120 --> 04:32:29.040]  It's john. We have joshua stroud. He is a a
[04:32:29.600 --> 04:32:32.400]  Yes. Well, joshua. I'll let you introduce yourself
[04:32:35.780 --> 04:32:40.660]  Oh, we can't hear him either. Yeah, I have i've got no audio there. There you are. We hear you
[04:32:44.860 --> 04:32:51.660]  Oh, no, yeah, I don't think so dang it joshua is an amazing cultivator and
[04:32:52.060 --> 04:32:58.940]  Strain guru from oregon who's doing a lot of work and giving his heart time and mind
[04:32:59.180 --> 04:33:01.180]  Also to the legacy project
[04:33:01.740 --> 04:33:04.940]  um shocks, I wish she could we could hear him
[04:33:06.380 --> 04:33:08.380]  But we can't
[04:33:08.780 --> 04:33:14.140]  He's he's right now traveling doing education on a lot of these things that we're talking about
[04:33:15.340 --> 04:33:19.580]  Oh, what a bummer I can see I can like hear little blips of him trying to get in and
[04:33:20.220 --> 04:33:23.340]  Get that voice out there. I'm really interested to hear what he has to say as well
[04:33:26.060 --> 04:33:32.300]  Yeah, kevin i've seen some crazy stuff over the years, uh in the past couple of people offering
[04:33:33.100 --> 04:33:36.380]  tools that can edit the cannabis gene and
[04:33:36.940 --> 04:33:42.080]  A guy who once explained to me, uh the indoor ag conference that his technology
[04:33:43.020 --> 04:33:48.240]  Didn't have to be reported to the federal government because it was gene editing and not gene modification
[04:33:48.960 --> 04:33:51.940]  And that was like a benefit of using his technology
[04:33:52.800 --> 04:33:55.280]  I mean like what there's some scary stuff out there
[04:33:55.280 --> 04:34:01.200]  I mean people I think preservation and like heirloom is probably something to take a look at like you've got something
[04:34:02.060 --> 04:34:03.200]  unadulterated
[04:34:03.200 --> 04:34:07.920]  Uh keeping that and maintaining that has like a a huge value right now, too
[04:34:09.920 --> 04:34:12.080]  Yeah, the the my issue with gene editing
[04:34:13.440 --> 04:34:17.360]  Is that when you when you when you take the snip when you cut that?
[04:34:18.400 --> 04:34:19.680]  portion out
[04:34:19.680 --> 04:34:22.100]  And you edit in your new material
[04:34:22.880 --> 04:34:24.880]  You chose to get rid of something
[04:34:26.080 --> 04:34:28.080]  and with with gene
[04:34:28.320 --> 04:34:33.680]  Rag, you know in linkage where you're you're gonna move pieces of an allele one way or another
[04:34:34.720 --> 04:34:40.100]  You you end up chopping chunks out that have like unintended consequences
[04:34:41.920 --> 04:34:46.480]  And I think that and and my issue with cannabis is is one of really health
[04:34:47.360 --> 04:34:54.160]  In that the anomaly that one could smoke herb for 50 or 60 years and not have lung cancer
[04:34:55.040 --> 04:34:58.560]  Where we would say that yes, there might be a case noted of it
[04:34:59.040 --> 04:35:05.940]  But by far the amount of people who've been impacted poorly from cannabis consumption is such an anomaly
[04:35:06.720 --> 04:35:08.720]  compared to the total cannabis usage
[04:35:09.680 --> 04:35:13.280]  So that means there must be phytoprotectants present in the plant
[04:35:14.000 --> 04:35:17.040]  That protect us from the damage from consuming the plant
[04:35:17.920 --> 04:35:21.040]  and so my fear of gene editing is that when you
[04:35:21.580 --> 04:35:27.600]  Brilliantly edit in your thing of that you want you edit out the part that keeps me from getting lung cancer
[04:35:29.040 --> 04:35:30.640]  That's a real concern
[04:35:30.640 --> 04:35:37.680]  It's that simple. Yeah, that's what I realized because no one should be able to burn this much organic material and not have lung problems
[04:35:37.920 --> 04:35:41.040]  You know, it's funny I was thinking about that today
[04:35:41.040 --> 04:35:44.080]  I was like I would love to see data of the number of people
[04:35:44.560 --> 04:35:51.520]  That have been lifetime consumers or 20 plus year consumers that have developed cancers in general not just lung cancer
[04:35:51.520 --> 04:35:53.520]  but overall cancer rates
[04:35:53.760 --> 04:35:56.720]  among cannabis users against non-cannabis users
[04:35:57.680 --> 04:36:03.040]  You know just mulling it in my brain, you know, how much are we fighting it every day through using this medicine?
[04:36:03.600 --> 04:36:08.960]  Oh no doubt, but the complexity cannabis being that it's the most complex plant
[04:36:10.000 --> 04:36:11.680]  on the planet
[04:36:11.680 --> 04:36:13.680]  It means that we don't have
[04:36:14.240 --> 04:36:19.760]  The education required to play with it and then expect the same results to come back
[04:36:19.920 --> 04:36:24.560]  So you're going to get people that are going to come in and they're going to address agronomic issues
[04:36:24.960 --> 04:36:32.240]  So they'll get faster maturation. They'll get better resistance. They'll get better distribution of flower throughout the plant
[04:36:32.560 --> 04:36:40.640]  So that you get better sunlight exposure evenly so that your coloration is more consistent like all the little details to make
[04:36:41.520 --> 04:36:44.580]  A quality go from 35 to 70
[04:36:46.240 --> 04:36:49.060]  If we can get a quality flower on 75
[04:36:49.760 --> 04:36:52.880]  Of the total plant, you know, you you're doing something
[04:36:53.520 --> 04:37:00.640]  And the ability to to you know, refine those those directions and then go into your chemotype steering
[04:37:01.280 --> 04:37:06.080]  But I still don't think that editing anything and removing anything is really within my
[04:37:07.680 --> 04:37:14.400]  My desire I don't I don't know anybody smart enough personally to tell me why it doesn't do what it should do to us
[04:37:14.400 --> 04:37:17.920]  Which causes problems so since no one can answer that question
[04:37:18.640 --> 04:37:22.240]  I don't think I want to have anybody tell me not to worry about edited herbs
[04:37:22.960 --> 04:37:29.920]  And that resonates. I just think that that means we should be gathering up every pocket of seed that like exists and like
[04:37:30.220 --> 04:37:32.320]  Preserving it, you know, uh,
[04:37:33.420 --> 04:37:39.860]  Independently, that's a huge movement. I anybody who's like in that zone of just keeping it alive and unadulterated
[04:37:40.640 --> 04:37:46.400]  It now it's just a critical time. I mean it was a critical time, you know, 100 years ago when they
[04:37:46.880 --> 04:37:49.600]  became like prohibited across like the world, but
[04:37:50.320 --> 04:37:55.600]  you know for those that like kept on to it and hung on to it and there's this crossover point where
[04:37:56.560 --> 04:38:00.160]  Things might get only can afford to get preserved because
[04:38:00.720 --> 04:38:06.240]  There's like a business or an industry propelling it or people's passion, you know
[04:38:06.960 --> 04:38:13.280]  That could be a really like interesting component of like breathing for the future where people are just true like air lift
[04:38:13.840 --> 04:38:15.840]  Yeah, well, I think it's really important
[04:38:16.080 --> 04:38:21.600]  To preserve those because think about it with those gene editing concerns that you're talking about there
[04:38:22.400 --> 04:38:24.400]  what happens when we
[04:38:24.720 --> 04:38:30.080]  Drop a wall to a resistance to virus that then penetrates this edited version
[04:38:31.120 --> 04:38:32.480]  and
[04:38:32.480 --> 04:38:36.240]  Viruses mutate it's what they do and now it becomes
[04:38:36.880 --> 04:38:41.040]  Capable of attacking attacking non-gene edited varieties and you can have
[04:38:41.900 --> 04:38:43.120]  massive
[04:38:43.120 --> 04:38:45.200]  global losses of genetics through
[04:38:46.060 --> 04:38:49.120]  Virology like this we've seen it with all sorts of different pests
[04:38:49.760 --> 04:38:54.960]  From you know bacteria or fungi to pathogens to powder post beetles or whatever
[04:38:55.600 --> 04:39:03.120]  Or you know aspen beetles like that's a huge concern when you start toying with the basic genetic structure of something to me
[04:39:03.280 --> 04:39:05.280]  Right and like yeah
[04:39:05.360 --> 04:39:09.680]  Hey, josh popped back in I see uh, can we hear you? I can't hear him yet, though
[04:39:14.490 --> 04:39:18.590]  Damn
[04:39:18.750 --> 04:39:23.710]  Josh we can see you but thanks for trying. Oh, I was just gonna tell him josh
[04:39:23.710 --> 04:39:28.590]  Oh, we just his signals really blow is what the platform's telling me
[04:39:30.110 --> 04:39:33.390]  Well, maybe encourage him to try with audio and not video
[04:39:36.730 --> 04:39:39.210]  We're playing like musical chairs with cameras right here
[04:39:42.010 --> 04:39:46.090]  Joshua did you hear that try audio because you're we'd love to hear you
[04:39:48.330 --> 04:39:51.210]  Oh, I think he did yeah, uh
[04:39:51.370 --> 04:39:55.470]  Uh
[04:39:55.470 --> 04:40:02.450]  No, nothing I can do about it epic camera shot though. Yeah, I want to hear what he's saying so bad
[04:40:05.470 --> 04:40:07.470]  Stuff to say
[04:40:07.470 --> 04:40:13.710]  Oh, so if we want to hear what joshua has to say we need to show up at earth dance this year
[04:40:14.430 --> 04:40:16.430]  Oh, hell. Yeah
[04:40:20.110 --> 04:40:22.110]  There we go
[04:40:22.990 --> 04:40:24.510]  Awesome
[04:40:24.510 --> 04:40:31.310]  Like just jumping back. I don't know how much time we have left. Lele or are we we got we've got like five ten more minutes
[04:40:31.390 --> 04:40:33.710]  And I love this, you know, I I think it
[04:40:34.270 --> 04:40:39.810]  What kevin is saying and what daniel just circled back around to you, you know kind of rearticulated
[04:40:40.830 --> 04:40:43.150]  Is that we do need to preserve?
[04:40:44.030 --> 04:40:48.670]  What's out there already in order to build a better future around this plant?
[04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:53.150]  Um, and it's so much has already been created
[04:40:53.790 --> 04:40:58.350]  That we just started getting pieces and we're not even there yet
[04:40:58.430 --> 04:41:03.790]  Like we just layered one peeled one layer of the onion, but we've just started getting science
[04:41:04.510 --> 04:41:07.390]  Able to start telling us what a lot of us know
[04:41:08.110 --> 04:41:12.750]  Um, and it's going to go beyond that look imagine what will happen when when science?
[04:41:13.550 --> 04:41:15.550]  Goes past what we know
[04:41:15.790 --> 04:41:23.390]  And all of a sudden we're looking at seeds that have been protected for 30 years and like kevin said they're the ones that cure cancer
[04:41:24.030 --> 04:41:29.470]  I don't know. I feel like mother nature is the smartest most wisest thing in the universe and
[04:41:30.110 --> 04:41:33.950]  Like kevin said we don't need to mess with her. Can we hear you now josh?
[04:41:35.470 --> 04:41:36.590]  Okay
[04:41:36.590 --> 04:41:38.590]  Yeah, and we'll need those genetics to
[04:41:39.130 --> 04:41:43.630]  Restrengthen all of the the you know diluted gene pool items in the future
[04:41:44.190 --> 04:41:49.070]  Right every that's what i'm saying like right now the phase that I you know get back to where I tried to start it
[04:41:49.550 --> 04:41:51.550]  poorly, but you know
[04:41:51.870 --> 04:41:52.910]  is that
[04:41:52.910 --> 04:41:56.910]  we're all going towards this one trend right now, and it's like the
[04:41:58.750 --> 04:41:59.870]  You know
[04:41:59.870 --> 04:42:06.990]  Commercial market is circulating around these concepts if it has to be purple has to be gassy and it has to be high thc
[04:42:07.630 --> 04:42:09.630]  Uh, and so we're monocropping
[04:42:10.270 --> 04:42:12.990]  It we're breeding it towards a monocrop. It's like
[04:42:13.630 --> 04:42:17.790]  Just such as like myths in the whole grand scheme of things. So
[04:42:18.510 --> 04:42:25.310]  Yeah, i've seen that whole palette the whole color the rainbow the whole all the colors and the crayon box all that, you know
[04:42:25.950 --> 04:42:29.150]  yeah, I think it's important for distributors and
[04:42:29.770 --> 04:42:31.790]  retailers to really
[04:42:31.790 --> 04:42:36.750]  Be the front lines of that defense also, right to the consumer saying hey, no
[04:42:37.710 --> 04:42:42.190]  You can have this but all this stuff is out there too and we need to get it out there
[04:42:42.190 --> 04:42:45.470]  It's hard to really convince the masses sometimes when you've got you know
[04:42:45.710 --> 04:42:51.870]  Right somebody on tv or a rapper or whatever being like this is the shit let the farmer sell the farmer's market
[04:42:52.270 --> 04:42:57.710]  Yeah, you know let the farmer grow their herb and just sell it direct to the customer and talk to the farmer
[04:42:57.790 --> 04:43:03.950]  And I bet you like 80 percent of that will get solved because there's no way the consumer wants just the same thing over and over
[04:43:04.030 --> 04:43:05.870]  again, I mean
[04:43:05.870 --> 04:43:09.250]  It's just not even true, you know, and so we've got this totally underdeveloped
[04:43:10.490 --> 04:43:14.590]  California legal market where there's limited retail access. So
[04:43:15.390 --> 04:43:18.190]  Eventually things will like stabilize. Um
[04:43:18.910 --> 04:43:24.510]  So just like yeah, I I say, you know buckle down and hang in there if you're capable push back against
[04:43:25.390 --> 04:43:28.270]  The laws and the rules and the like, you know
[04:43:28.830 --> 04:43:35.790]  None of this was the cannabis industry definitely wasn't built on like sound regulation. That's not what led us here. Um,
[04:43:36.190 --> 04:43:38.430]  so definitely like founded on
[04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:44.670]  You know people like you, you know pushing back and saying this is how i'm gonna live my life
[04:43:44.830 --> 04:43:49.550]  I'm, just kind of following what you think is right. Yeah, I think you're right in a lot of ways you look at
[04:43:50.110 --> 04:43:57.310]  The continually growing movement of people knowing their farmers going to their farmers markets being like I buy my lettuce from tom
[04:43:57.710 --> 04:43:59.470]  Because his lettuce is good
[04:43:59.470 --> 04:44:01.390]  And our kids go to school together
[04:44:01.390 --> 04:44:02.430]  so
[04:44:02.430 --> 04:44:07.550]  I want to support him and like to allow the cannabis farmers to participate once again
[04:44:08.670 --> 04:44:15.570]  In that side of things because so many of the cannabis community. That's how we shop. That's how we spend our dollars in the community
[04:44:16.370 --> 04:44:19.330]  And why not allow consumers to choose right
[04:44:19.810 --> 04:44:26.530]  and maybe only extend that option to to these small farms because they're the ones that are up against this like totally like
[04:44:27.710 --> 04:44:31.650]  bureaucratic system that's built for like deep pockets and to kind of
[04:44:32.050 --> 04:44:38.290]  Sift out people for the time being, you know, it's like we just let the small farmers go direct, you know people that are
[04:44:38.930 --> 04:44:42.130]  Using the sun and and harnessing. I mean, I don't know
[04:44:42.930 --> 04:44:44.930]  It's cool to see all the people in humbled
[04:44:45.570 --> 04:44:50.930]  Are fighting it this year because you can just really see like if you're here doing it still
[04:44:51.490 --> 04:44:57.010]  It's because you are passionate about it and it's about your belief system. So like more power to you
[04:44:58.610 --> 04:45:01.410]  Yeah, kevin, how do you see this moving to the future I guess
[04:45:04.130 --> 04:45:06.530]  You mean in in what we're doing in in terms of
[04:45:07.330 --> 04:45:09.330]  farmer direct sales
[04:45:09.490 --> 04:45:14.690]  yeah, and you know continuing to strengthen the community and the ability of that small farmer to compete in
[04:45:15.650 --> 04:45:16.930]  this
[04:45:16.930 --> 04:45:21.330]  You know kind of getting dwarfed in the market currently. How do we continue to grow it in that way?
[04:45:22.690 --> 04:45:25.970]  You know, you'd love to have a positive answer
[04:45:27.250 --> 04:45:29.890]  But when you look at any other industry
[04:45:31.090 --> 04:45:35.250]  They look pretty much the same. There is no unique industry where people go that
[04:45:36.050 --> 04:45:42.370]  Good people get rewarded. What what happens is customers want easy shit cheap shit
[04:45:43.090 --> 04:45:45.090]  And they want it yesterday
[04:45:45.570 --> 04:45:49.010]  and so when cannabis became, you know, really really
[04:45:50.130 --> 04:45:53.570]  Easy to access it allowed people to build, you know a lot of
[04:45:54.670 --> 04:45:59.410]  Information so when you add, you know 20 000 stores in cali you had customers, you know
[04:45:59.490 --> 04:46:03.810]  Really happy and you had farmers happy because you had outlets to move your herb
[04:46:04.690 --> 04:46:06.690]  Once we switched into the new system
[04:46:07.490 --> 04:46:12.450]  It ended and I don't think that it will ever return in a time frame
[04:46:12.850 --> 04:46:16.450]  That allows there to be like a preservation for the majority of us
[04:46:16.530 --> 04:46:18.770]  I think that you know a couple make it through
[04:46:19.490 --> 04:46:24.370]  And then new participants come in that are willing to deal with the new realities of the industry
[04:46:25.250 --> 04:46:27.250]  I think that the community remains
[04:46:28.210 --> 04:46:34.210]  In terms of humble county and and the place it provides but us as people I know people that are moving right now
[04:46:35.250 --> 04:46:40.850]  Yeah, so they're running for their lives trying to figure out where they're going to go and continue to do what they do
[04:46:41.170 --> 04:46:48.530]  Because if you're running a farm you're you're you're really just breaking even if you're really running the farm through the system, right?
[04:46:48.850 --> 04:46:52.850]  You're not backdooring any of your shit. You're not doing any side stuff
[04:46:53.650 --> 04:46:55.650]  You're just running your operation
[04:46:56.130 --> 04:47:03.730]  They're really not profitable like you are trying to keep it alive long enough to get through this purge
[04:47:04.530 --> 04:47:07.490]  But you know in california, we're talking minimum two more years
[04:47:08.450 --> 04:47:14.530]  So, you know you got you got five million more square foot coming on from just one operator down south
[04:47:15.330 --> 04:47:20.930]  So when one operator can put five million square foot of greenhouse out
[04:47:21.010 --> 04:47:25.730]  That means he's really got 25 million square foot of canopy for a single run
[04:47:26.690 --> 04:47:32.850]  um, you got a problem for a minute and so I think that the the the thing that needs to take place is the farmers need
[04:47:32.850 --> 04:47:37.170]  To be able to step back and and say okay if we can furlough the farm
[04:47:37.890 --> 04:47:43.430]  If we can if we can maintain the payments and keep it alive so that we don't lose the asset
[04:47:44.210 --> 04:47:47.010]  And allow this to kind of scrub itself out
[04:47:47.570 --> 04:47:53.270]  But to get into it just for the sake of this is what I do. I'm like you're running head first into a chainsaw
[04:47:54.210 --> 04:48:00.770]  And that's not a smart move to me. The long game is we we maintain the ownership of the property in the farm
[04:48:01.730 --> 04:48:03.650]  And we figure out how to work from there
[04:48:03.650 --> 04:48:09.570]  But any any subsidized system even mendo where they're like, you know, we're gonna let you have uh, the ability to bring you know
[04:48:09.730 --> 04:48:12.150]  Sell it at a location. You're still gonna have to have the distributor
[04:48:12.530 --> 04:48:18.130]  Like by the time you're done with all this shit. How much weed do you think you're actually gonna move at the weekend?
[04:48:18.930 --> 04:48:20.450]  at a booth
[04:48:20.450 --> 04:48:26.850]  Like when you got 400 600 pounds at your farm, right? I mean like we didn't sell urban booths
[04:48:27.730 --> 04:48:32.710]  To really do well. It was in like market exposure. It was also to gather two 15s
[04:48:33.270 --> 04:48:39.430]  Like really you remember that you had the team. Yeah, and it allowed you to stack tags and protect yourself legally
[04:48:39.990 --> 04:48:40.950]  so
[04:48:40.950 --> 04:48:45.270]  If you're trying to move a farm's worth of weed and you're having to move it at farmer's markets
[04:48:46.070 --> 04:48:51.030]  And you're getting rid of a half ounce at a time. You know, that's 32 even if you had 100 customers, right?
[04:48:51.430 --> 04:48:53.430]  You're only talking a couple pounds
[04:48:53.830 --> 04:48:56.150]  So it would take you every weekend of the year
[04:48:57.110 --> 04:49:04.550]  So, I mean maybe what small farm means to needs to mean is you know for me it's like that you run it for your family
[04:49:04.630 --> 04:49:05.670]  it's like
[04:49:05.670 --> 04:49:06.710]  it
[04:49:06.710 --> 04:49:12.150]  Why grow 600 pounds if you're not going to sell it at the farmer's market? Well, yeah, I put the labor in
[04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:18.550]  No, for real for real you have you can be a farmer at any level. It's not about quantity
[04:49:19.190 --> 04:49:23.670]  Right, you don't have to give up your craft, but you have to be aware
[04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:28.630]  That you're running into a situation where the customer has
[04:49:29.490 --> 04:49:31.590]  access easily
[04:49:31.590 --> 04:49:36.310]  To mass produce product because the supply chain favors that system
[04:49:36.710 --> 04:49:40.550]  So when craft product gets there 10 months after it was chopped
[04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:43.430]  Um, you're not looking good
[04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:49.830]  And the other the other groups are beating you to death financially. So you're having to charge more for less quality
[04:49:50.550 --> 04:49:55.690]  Yeah, you really need to just skip the middleman and a small farmer that could take a subscription
[04:49:56.550 --> 04:49:58.550]  Get fresh product out
[04:49:58.550 --> 04:50:05.190]  Whatever scale it is limited releases and building an audience e-commerce is important. You know, that's where it is
[04:50:06.230 --> 04:50:12.710]  Exclusive releases where you bring things out, but you only truly bring out 100 pounds of it
[04:50:13.270 --> 04:50:15.670]  Yeah, there's only 100 pounds in the system
[04:50:16.630 --> 04:50:21.510]  It allows you to be able to to put things out in in and get traction on
[04:50:22.130 --> 04:50:28.630]  Desirability and it starts to allow us to change valuation to where things do have high value
[04:50:28.630 --> 04:50:33.750]  But not everything does and the issue with us in herb is that for most of us our entire career
[04:50:34.230 --> 04:50:36.870]  Herb was valuable as long as you could produce it
[04:50:38.710 --> 04:50:40.470]  Yeah, absolutely
[04:50:40.470 --> 04:50:44.550]  That's not the case anymore. It herbs free. I mean, there's a lot of herb right now
[04:50:45.910 --> 04:50:51.510]  I mean, we've all seen the videos on instagram and everywhere else people dumping pounds into the fire, you know, it's a
[04:50:52.630 --> 04:50:56.790]  It's happening. You have to you have to you have to mulch them, you know, we're not allowed to burn them in metric
[04:50:56.790 --> 04:50:58.790]  We have to mulch them right
[04:50:59.430 --> 04:51:04.070]  Well for those metric folks, but you know, we're there's plenty of mulching throwing them on a fire too
[04:51:04.630 --> 04:51:05.910]  And yeah
[04:51:05.910 --> 04:51:11.770]  That's what's scary. But I do think that that farmer's market model allows at least you to go and build a clientele
[04:51:12.730 --> 04:51:20.490]  That then goes home and consumes through these limited releases through retailers, but it allows you to get your product
[04:51:21.050 --> 04:51:26.330]  Out there and to tell your story and connect. So I just still think that there's hopefully some avenue there
[04:51:27.450 --> 04:51:31.290]  Keep the farm though. Kevin, keep the farm keep the farm start
[04:51:32.650 --> 04:51:38.490]  If you have to don't lose the farm don't lose the farm. That's the key thing. Don't lose the land
[04:51:38.970 --> 04:51:40.490]  Don't
[04:51:40.490 --> 04:51:46.010]  into the community that you're you might have established or your family might have established but the bottom line is
[04:51:46.490 --> 04:51:48.650]  Humboldt county is not going to turn into a ghost town
[04:51:49.210 --> 04:51:51.470]  Humboldt county is about to go meteoric
[04:51:52.410 --> 04:51:58.330]  In what's about to happen here and you need to make sure you're able to keep your hands on that property
[04:51:58.650 --> 04:52:00.650]  So that your children can benefit too
[04:52:00.970 --> 04:52:07.050]  And it's just we have to have a different relationship with cannabis in the process because cannabis did all the work prior
[04:52:07.370 --> 04:52:12.330]  All we had to do was produce her and she danced her way around and came back with a bag of money
[04:52:12.970 --> 04:52:15.130]  She's not doing that anymore. That's not her job
[04:52:15.610 --> 04:52:17.790]  Our job is to be able to be good supporters
[04:52:18.410 --> 04:52:23.450]  And figure out how to work together and we'll end up having a better situation and it's just it's it's tough
[04:52:23.450 --> 04:52:29.210]  But it's it's going to be all right now. It's about preserving the legacy that's been created by the plant
[04:52:30.650 --> 04:52:34.970]  And by the people that that were part of that where you had you did have a good community
[04:52:35.370 --> 04:52:37.690]  You did have some really caring people and you had
[04:52:38.330 --> 04:52:43.210]  A genuine ability to be you I think that's what made humble county unique is that you could be you
[04:52:43.770 --> 04:52:50.010]  That you could be your quirky self and be accepted for that and it allowed people to really be themselves
[04:52:50.090 --> 04:52:52.090]  And I don't think that most places you go
[04:52:52.090 --> 04:52:58.570]  You really know anybody because they're so afraid to reveal their flaws and in humble you you wore that shit like a coat
[04:52:59.210 --> 04:53:04.570]  So it it allowed you to be you know, a lot freer in your thought period
[04:53:05.450 --> 04:53:09.450]  You know and and I would love to be able to see some of that, you know remain that'd be a gift
[04:53:09.530 --> 04:53:11.530]  I'd like to see my kids and my grandkids get
[04:53:12.330 --> 04:53:19.290]  I mean, that's really I mean at least in my history. That's what started it was it wasn't about growing weed, right?
[04:53:19.370 --> 04:53:24.890]  It was about building personal freedom. That's what the whole back to the land movement was about
[04:53:25.690 --> 04:53:27.450]  um, and I think
[04:53:27.450 --> 04:53:31.530]  You know when I think about genetics and I think about the technologies and stuff
[04:53:31.690 --> 04:53:36.490]  I just I don't know one of you I think said something similar, but it's power to the people again
[04:53:36.730 --> 04:53:40.490]  It's putting the power if we choose, right?
[04:53:41.530 --> 04:53:48.330]  Here we like now we know how this shit show goes. Let's be prepared for it with our our genetics
[04:53:49.050 --> 04:53:52.810]  And and and and keep the power in our hands
[04:53:53.450 --> 04:53:54.330]  um
[04:53:54.330 --> 04:53:59.930]  I I think there's a lot of people that are not in the market that that they have more power in this
[04:54:00.310 --> 04:54:04.810]  Conversation than they think um, especially when as we look towards the future with
[04:54:05.670 --> 04:54:08.170]  Federalization coming down the pike whenever that is
[04:54:09.050 --> 04:54:11.050]  Germany just went legal
[04:54:11.050 --> 04:54:18.490]  Um, that's quite a powerhouse to go legal. That's gonna shift like california shifted the u.s market
[04:54:19.050 --> 04:54:22.650]  Um, and and I think we still have a lot to offer
[04:54:23.290 --> 04:54:27.050]  And going fallow i've heard a lot of people going fallow right now
[04:54:27.130 --> 04:54:32.170]  I I find it a very courageous and honorable thing to do right now
[04:54:32.570 --> 04:54:39.290]  Um, because it's not giving up. It's it's tying down the pulling the sails down and tying down the what is it?
[04:54:40.010 --> 04:54:42.090]  I don't remember the word but anyways, hey
