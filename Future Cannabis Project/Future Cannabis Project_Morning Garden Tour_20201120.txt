[00:00.510 --> 00:04.150]  All right, we are live.
[00:04.150 --> 00:05.150]  Welcome.
[00:05.150 --> 00:12.710]  I have not taken my poo yet this morning because I'm barely into my coffee.
[00:12.710 --> 00:19.870]  So someone else may need to solo for like five minutes while I run out, but I love how
[00:19.870 --> 00:21.710]  comfortable I feel with everyone.
[00:21.710 --> 00:26.510]  I'm going to go with the mask in the flower room.
[00:26.510 --> 00:27.510]  Okay.
[00:27.510 --> 00:31.710]  All right, so welcome everyone.
[00:31.710 --> 00:35.790]  We're going to do a little round robin morning garden tour.
[00:35.790 --> 00:43.510]  We got a whole bunch of aspiring or I feel like no one's there.
[00:43.510 --> 00:48.830]  Everyone's always on a journey towards kind of living soil.
[00:48.830 --> 00:50.950]  We got a variety of sizes.
[00:50.950 --> 00:54.670]  Jake is going to kick us off.
[00:54.670 --> 01:04.550]  He's ready to go operate on some plants in Long Beach, California, where it's probably
[01:04.550 --> 01:09.830]  going from cool and brisk to warm and sunny.
[01:09.830 --> 01:13.710]  And how many square feet is your facility?
[01:13.710 --> 01:23.030]  Our building's around 7,000, 7,500, but we have about maybe 3,000 square feet of growing
[01:23.030 --> 01:27.990]  space, but we're only cultivating in two flower rooms and our bedroom right now, just
[01:27.990 --> 01:30.150]  because of how long it says the tax.
[01:30.150 --> 01:33.730]  And because we're just starting up, we weren't going to have enough plants to fill the rest
[01:33.730 --> 01:35.630]  of the rooms.
[01:35.630 --> 01:40.870]  And here you have to pay the tax upfront for the whole year for what you're going to cultivate
[01:40.870 --> 01:41.870]  in.
[01:41.870 --> 01:45.830]  And so it's kind of complicated on like, I'm trying to work with the city to create like
[01:45.830 --> 01:50.870]  an audit program to be able to get money back on our taxes because we're not using all the
[01:50.870 --> 01:52.510]  square footage.
[01:52.510 --> 01:55.110]  So it's just kind of complicated with that.
[01:55.110 --> 01:57.990]  But yeah, so we have five flower rooms in total.
[01:57.990 --> 02:01.270]  They're all the same size, about 700 square feet.
[02:01.270 --> 02:05.310]  And we're only operating in two of them right now.
[02:05.310 --> 02:06.310]  Got it.
[02:06.310 --> 02:09.810]  How many lights you got going on right now?
[02:09.810 --> 02:13.310]  So they were set up for 24 lights per room, but I've just rotated one room.
[02:13.310 --> 02:16.510]  Now we're running 20 lights and we've got the same bar rating.
[02:16.510 --> 02:18.830]  And so we cut out four, so that's all.
[02:18.830 --> 02:20.950]  So right now the rooms are 20, 20 lights.
[02:20.950 --> 02:25.830]  And then once we test LEDs out, we'll most likely go back to 24.
[02:25.830 --> 02:27.870]  When we run LEDs.
[02:27.870 --> 02:31.510]  And what kind of LEDs?
[02:31.510 --> 02:35.110]  We haven't tested any yet, but we're going to do side by side, probably on the Gevita
[02:35.110 --> 02:39.870]  and the, and the probably the Lux LED.
[02:39.870 --> 02:40.870]  Okay.
[02:40.870 --> 02:44.870]  All right, here we go.
[02:44.870 --> 02:45.870]  Awesome.
[02:45.910 --> 02:48.110]  Is it normal that I only see myself?
[02:48.110 --> 02:49.110]  Am I supposed to see you guys?
[02:49.110 --> 02:50.110]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:50.110 --> 02:53.110]  No, you are featured right now because we're all paying attention to you.
[02:53.110 --> 02:54.110]  Oh cool.
[02:54.110 --> 02:55.110]  Hey guys.
[02:55.110 --> 02:56.110]  Well, this is, this is one of our flower rooms.
[02:56.110 --> 02:57.110]  Can you guys hear me okay still?
[02:57.110 --> 02:58.110]  Yep.
[02:58.110 --> 02:59.110]  All right, great.
[02:59.110 --> 03:02.110]  And the video is pretty clear?
[03:02.110 --> 03:03.110]  Yep.
[03:03.110 --> 03:04.110]  Oh yeah.
[03:04.110 --> 03:05.110]  All right, great.
[03:05.110 --> 03:06.110]  Well, cool.
[03:06.110 --> 03:14.390]  So let me slide a table over real fast.
[03:14.390 --> 03:18.470]  We did a little something special for Jake over here.
[03:18.470 --> 03:25.910]  He did a rolling benches by I believe NextGen and they had a cage sides on them and we made
[03:25.910 --> 03:27.750]  a liner to go in there for them.
[03:27.750 --> 03:28.750]  So you'll see that.
[03:28.750 --> 03:31.850]  Yep.
[03:31.850 --> 03:32.850]  Yeah.
[03:32.850 --> 03:39.690]  So we've got, I'll get down to, so these are our tables and this is the NextGen rolling
[03:39.690 --> 03:43.970]  table and these are the grassroots pots.
[03:43.970 --> 03:50.250]  And so it's like flipped over here, kind of rolled over the edges as you can see on
[03:50.250 --> 03:56.040]  the sides.
[03:56.040 --> 03:59.920]  And so this room we just flipped like 20 days ago.
[03:59.920 --> 04:06.520]  We're on day I think 19 or no, we're on day 20 right now.
[04:06.520 --> 04:08.960]  This is our cookies and cream number two.
[04:08.960 --> 04:14.400]  So it's our strain that we, it's our highest testing strain currently.
[04:14.840 --> 04:21.520]  And yeah, let me see if I can try to get the camera into the soil.
[04:21.520 --> 04:25.880]  So we've got a small mushroom right now.
[04:25.880 --> 04:31.680]  We're going to be building it with more cannabis stalk.
[04:31.680 --> 04:34.320]  And yeah, this is a second cycle room.
[04:34.320 --> 04:42.440]  So we harvested about a month ago, month and a half in this room and we've replanted.
[04:42.480 --> 04:48.040]  And yeah, this room is doing really well, especially with how we rotated the lights.
[04:48.040 --> 04:49.400]  It's looking really, really nice.
[04:49.400 --> 04:56.400]  It's a little smaller than we'll probably run in terms of the plant size, but we just
[04:56.400 --> 04:59.320]  needed to get more production going.
[04:59.320 --> 05:01.280]  And we're doing some phenol hunting.
[05:01.280 --> 05:04.680]  This bed right here has really tall plants.
[05:04.680 --> 05:08.000]  We're phenol hunting some Northern Lights and Green Crack.
[05:08.600 --> 05:13.040]  A couple of the Northern Lights and Green Crack are stretching like gnarly.
[05:13.040 --> 05:16.480]  Yeah, it looks like you have Manute Bull in there or something.
[05:16.480 --> 05:17.480]  Right.
[05:20.000 --> 05:21.000]  Let me...
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.760]  A taco fall for all the younger people.
[05:25.760 --> 05:26.760]  Right.
[05:26.760 --> 05:28.760]  But yeah, I can stay in the room.
[05:28.760 --> 05:29.760]  I don't know if it's...
[05:29.760 --> 05:31.640]  You guys can still hear me okay, right?
[05:31.640 --> 05:32.640]  It's just super loud in here.
[05:32.640 --> 05:33.640]  Yeah, I know.
[05:33.640 --> 05:34.640]  We can hear you.
[05:34.640 --> 05:37.040]  So what's your replanting strategy?
[05:37.080 --> 05:42.120]  Are you just chopping the tops and leaving the roots and then replanting next to them
[05:42.120 --> 05:43.120]  or...?
[05:43.120 --> 05:44.120]  Yeah, absolutely.
[05:44.120 --> 05:50.120]  So what we've been doing is we always chop the plant and then leave everything in to
[05:50.120 --> 05:51.680]  decompose.
[05:51.680 --> 05:58.840]  And then we will generally take out the rooting cube, even if it's a peat moss cube.
[05:58.840 --> 06:03.560]  And so what we did on the last round and the first round is we vegged in quarter gallon
[06:03.560 --> 06:06.800]  pods in our bedroom and then we transplanted those in.
[06:06.800 --> 06:11.400]  But the next round in our other flower room that we're about to replant in the next few
[06:11.400 --> 06:16.960]  days, we're going to be transplanting clones in so that we don't displace any soil.
[06:16.960 --> 06:20.960]  And so we're going to veg in the flower room on the next round.
[06:20.960 --> 06:21.960]  Got it.
[06:21.960 --> 06:27.120]  Love to hear about your irrigation that you got going on there.
[06:27.120 --> 06:32.240]  Yeah, I just actually finished all this like a couple of weeks ago.
[06:32.240 --> 06:36.520]  So we've got all these overhead lines coming in.
[06:36.520 --> 06:39.840]  I plumbed all the Schedule 80 up top, comes in the room.
[06:39.840 --> 06:42.240]  We've got it's all RO water coming in.
[06:42.240 --> 06:47.120]  We're like people ask about that all the time, but we're on Long Beach City tap water.
[06:47.120 --> 06:50.760]  And so we just need to filter it or else it's going to...
[06:50.760 --> 06:56.920]  Our beds, everything, all the tables are going to get super calcified.
[06:56.920 --> 07:01.880]  And so right now we just we have a big RO tank in the back and a dab pump and we're
[07:02.520 --> 07:07.360]  pumping RO into the rooms and then it'll come down from the wall.
[07:07.360 --> 07:09.000]  Sorry, I'm moving around.
[07:09.000 --> 07:14.800]  Comes down from here and then we'll come into the table on a three quarter shut off valve
[07:14.800 --> 07:18.600]  and then we're piped into all of our garden grids.
[07:18.600 --> 07:22.680]  So we've got these grids in here.
[07:22.680 --> 07:29.840]  We'll water in and we've been dialing in the timing on them and they've been working pretty
[07:29.840 --> 07:30.840]  well.
[07:30.840 --> 07:35.400]  We've been able to figure out that we just need to run shorter watering times, but more
[07:35.400 --> 07:39.480]  frequently.
[07:39.480 --> 07:44.000]  We've been dialing it in to where we're really not getting too much runoff and we can clean
[07:44.000 --> 07:45.680]  it up appropriately.
[07:45.680 --> 07:50.800]  Are you just basing everything off of runoff or how are you taking moisture measurements?
[07:50.800 --> 07:53.080]  We meter test the soil every day.
[07:53.080 --> 07:59.120]  So yeah, we just use a moisture meter, just an analog moisture meter.
[07:59.120 --> 08:00.120]  What meter are you using?
[08:00.400 --> 08:02.920]  Just the most basic one.
[08:02.920 --> 08:06.080]  We're not super fancy with that type of meter.
[08:06.080 --> 08:10.640]  Anything that looks like these or something like that.
[08:10.640 --> 08:12.760]  And that's worked really, really well for us.
[08:12.760 --> 08:13.960]  I'll head back in there one sec.
[08:13.960 --> 08:17.520]  I got to grab my phone in case these guys are hitting me up.
[08:17.520 --> 08:23.520]  Now are you doing the living soil raised bed liner or is it just the traditional fabric
[08:23.520 --> 08:24.520]  ones?
[08:24.520 --> 08:26.160]  We're using the living soil liners.
[08:26.160 --> 08:27.160]  Nice, killer.
[08:27.280 --> 08:33.480]  Have you used the regular fabric ones as a bit of a control compared to the living soil
[08:33.480 --> 08:34.480]  with that?
[08:34.480 --> 08:37.280]  We have not.
[08:37.280 --> 08:38.280]  We have not.
[08:38.280 --> 08:39.280]  Yeah.
[08:39.280 --> 08:42.480]  I would only imagine in our...
[08:42.480 --> 08:49.960]  Well, the thing about the beds, the garden grids that we use is the edges are not actually...
[08:49.960 --> 08:52.440]  The water is mainly going into the middle.
[08:52.440 --> 08:53.960]  It's not shooting at the edges.
[08:53.960 --> 08:56.900]  So occasionally we'll have to water the sides.
[08:57.640 --> 09:01.260]  They do make a system that will water out to the edges, but then it will most likely
[09:01.260 --> 09:05.540]  just drain down the sides because they're plastic.
[09:05.540 --> 09:06.900]  Let me pop our bedroom open.
[09:06.900 --> 09:12.620]  It's kind of in the midst of getting turned around a little bit.
[09:12.620 --> 09:17.180]  Now, did you have any kind of a mulch layer going on?
[09:17.180 --> 09:18.180]  I didn't.
[09:18.180 --> 09:19.180]  Yeah.
[09:19.180 --> 09:20.180]  What were you doing?
[09:20.180 --> 09:23.180]  Oh, in the flower room?
[09:23.180 --> 09:24.180]  Yeah.
[09:24.260 --> 09:30.060]  So we will shred our own cannabis stalk.
[09:30.060 --> 09:34.020]  So after we dry or when we have plants that we chop down, we'll shred them up and we'll
[09:34.020 --> 09:38.620]  create like wood chip bark out of cannabis stalk.
[09:38.620 --> 09:44.260]  And I'll show you this other flower room that is empty right now because we just harvested
[09:44.260 --> 09:51.860]  on Wednesday and we're about to flip it within the next few days again.
[09:51.940 --> 10:00.100]  A lot of these have a lot of, let's see, these ones have a lot of like, all of that.
[10:00.100 --> 10:02.980]  It looks like straw, but it's actually cannabis stalk.
[10:02.980 --> 10:06.780]  And then same thing over here.
[10:06.780 --> 10:11.660]  We have a lot of fine ground stalk.
[10:11.660 --> 10:15.700]  And like all of this stuff, like all these wood chips, this is what we like to use for
[10:15.700 --> 10:17.100]  our mulch layer.
[10:17.100 --> 10:18.100]  Yeah.
[10:18.260 --> 10:25.940]  Now, how long you guys been doing the mulch with the preexisting material?
[10:25.940 --> 10:26.940]  Since day one?
[10:26.940 --> 10:29.340]  Yeah, pretty much.
[10:29.340 --> 10:33.700]  Like we had the soil and as soon as we could, as soon as we had plants that we could cut
[10:33.700 --> 10:38.860]  down and we were growing some clover to mulch on it too, but the clover doesn't dry out
[10:38.860 --> 10:40.860]  as well as cannabis leaves.
[10:41.860 --> 10:53.740]  Any issues with past plant material re-entering the new cycle by being mulched?
[10:53.740 --> 10:56.620]  I mean, any garden does deal with pests.
[10:56.620 --> 11:01.060]  You know, like we've got fungus gnats here and there and just little things that we deal
[11:01.060 --> 11:04.700]  with, but nothing has been a major issue.
[11:04.700 --> 11:10.700]  We do our own in-house neem and aloe and hemp soap foliar.
[11:11.540 --> 11:14.500]  We're not afraid of having a few flies here and there.
[11:14.500 --> 11:15.500]  Oh, absolutely.
[11:15.500 --> 11:16.500]  Yeah.
[11:16.500 --> 11:22.100]  And so, you know, we're constantly replacing sticky fly traps to monitor pest populations,
[11:22.100 --> 11:23.100]  things like that.
[11:23.100 --> 11:28.060]  I was thinking more like pathogens, things that are going to stay in the tissue.
[11:28.060 --> 11:29.260]  Oh, yeah.
[11:29.260 --> 11:33.060]  We haven't had too many issues.
[11:33.060 --> 11:36.940]  I have sent some things out for lab testing and everything, for the most part, has been
[11:36.940 --> 11:37.940]  pretty solid.
[11:38.940 --> 11:39.940]  Yeah.
[11:39.940 --> 11:42.420]  And it looks like, you know, you guys are totally on your IPM and being clean about
[11:42.420 --> 11:43.420]  everything too.
[11:43.420 --> 11:44.420]  So, you know.
[11:44.420 --> 11:45.420]  For sure.
[11:45.420 --> 11:46.420]  A hundred percent.
[11:46.420 --> 11:49.020]  And that's definitely a big part of it.
[11:49.020 --> 11:52.660]  But even growing in any living soil, when you send it out for lab sampling, they're
[11:52.660 --> 11:54.620]  going to find some type of bacteria in there.
[11:54.620 --> 11:58.420]  But whether it's going to be pathogenic or not is another story.
[11:58.420 --> 12:00.020]  Cool, man.
[12:00.020 --> 12:01.020]  And this is our bedroom.
[12:01.020 --> 12:06.540]  We got a few big plants, some new moms that were growing up right now.
[12:06.540 --> 12:08.180]  And these are all in grassroots pots.
[12:08.180 --> 12:11.420]  And then these have a lot of these have a lot more mulch on them.
[12:11.420 --> 12:16.580]  So a lot of them have this is a second cycle mother pot.
[12:16.580 --> 12:19.860]  So we've already grown and chopped down one of the moms.
[12:19.860 --> 12:20.860]  Nice.
[12:20.860 --> 12:25.140]  And this is where you were doing the concentrated biology was in this room?
[12:25.140 --> 12:26.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:26.140 --> 12:30.220]  We've ran the microbe teas in this room a few times now.
[12:30.220 --> 12:36.100]  And I watered them out in our flower room one time, but like between cycles.
[12:36.660 --> 12:40.380]  How long do you keep the moms in circulation?
[12:40.380 --> 12:42.100]  It varies.
[12:42.100 --> 12:44.100]  Like sometimes six months, maybe longer.
[12:44.100 --> 12:49.620]  This one here has been going about like six months and it's been it's getting to its final
[12:49.620 --> 12:50.620]  days.
[12:50.620 --> 12:51.620]  We're going to take some more cuts.
[12:51.620 --> 12:53.740]  We're going to basically chop it in half and then see how it does.
[12:53.740 --> 13:01.300]  But we've been feeding teas and mainly amending with worm casting teas and a couple of microbe
[13:01.300 --> 13:03.900]  teas here and there.
[13:03.900 --> 13:06.300]  How are you measuring things with the moms?
[13:06.300 --> 13:11.620]  Like, do you do you quantify stuff on like, you know, how many cuts we can get per week
[13:11.620 --> 13:12.620]  or?
[13:12.620 --> 13:13.620]  Yeah, like it.
[13:13.620 --> 13:19.940]  Well, if you're if we're looking at cuts, you know, we'll gauge on the size of the plant.
[13:19.940 --> 13:25.180]  But if like, for example, our cookies and cream number two, we got about around 150
[13:25.180 --> 13:30.220]  cuts per mom and we can do that every couple of weeks or so, maybe every three to four.
[13:30.220 --> 13:34.500]  That's why we're trying to create some more moms of our keeper phenos so that we can really
[13:34.500 --> 13:36.380]  have enough in rotation.
[13:36.380 --> 13:38.900]  Whose gear is it all?
[13:38.900 --> 13:42.180]  I want to.
[13:42.180 --> 13:43.620]  It's all seeds that we've started right now.
[13:43.620 --> 13:48.820]  We're running cookies and cream from exotic genetics and mimosa from symbiotic genetics.
[13:48.820 --> 13:54.100]  Yeah, the exotic all of his stuff is just trichome down.
[13:54.100 --> 13:56.020]  He's got some fire gear.
[13:56.020 --> 14:00.090]  Yeah.
[14:00.530 --> 14:04.690]  And who else's stuff are you running, you said?
[14:04.690 --> 14:10.610]  Yeah, we're running mimosa from symbiotic genetics.
[14:10.610 --> 14:12.890]  And I'll give you a peek in our dry room here.
[14:12.890 --> 14:16.290]  This we got some flowers drying.
[14:16.290 --> 14:28.150]  These have been in here since Wednesday.
[14:28.150 --> 14:33.830]  We're about two days in.
[14:33.830 --> 14:36.430]  And this is all mimosa right here.
[14:36.430 --> 14:37.590]  So it was a small harvest.
[14:37.590 --> 14:41.630]  That's why everything's pretty spaced out.
[14:41.630 --> 14:45.070]  What what what temp and RH are you guys doing for your room?
[14:45.070 --> 14:47.670]  We run about I'll read it right now what it's at.
[14:47.670 --> 14:54.670]  But we aim for between like 61 to 63 degrees at 59, 62 percent humidity.
[14:54.670 --> 14:56.390]  Right now, the DQ is about to kick on.
[14:56.390 --> 15:01.750]  We're at sixty two point six degrees at 61 percent humidity right now.
[15:01.750 --> 15:08.790]  And so my DQ kicks on at 62 and it'll drop it down to about 58.
[15:08.790 --> 15:10.870]  So, yeah, that's how you do it, man.
[15:10.870 --> 15:16.870]  Yep. And therefore, the mimosa dries a little faster.
[15:16.870 --> 15:21.990]  We'll probably dry them between eight and 11 days.
[15:21.990 --> 15:27.430]  But most stuff would generally go between 10 and 14 days.
[15:27.430 --> 15:29.590]  Nice. Yeah.
[15:29.590 --> 15:34.310]  And then we've got all these bins after we're done when we bring it to trim all of these bins here.
[15:34.310 --> 15:37.790]  These are all food grade. They're made for direct food contact.
[15:37.790 --> 15:42.990]  So we take cleanliness very seriously and and just using food grade products.
[15:42.990 --> 15:46.950]  We're I mean, we're producing something that we inhale into our lungs.
[15:46.990 --> 15:58.950]  And so, you know, we're trying to go above and beyond just to really adhere to what we think the future is going to be in terms of guidance for how how the plant is processed.
[15:58.950 --> 16:06.470]  But yeah, you know, we're we're just trying to really, really set a good tone on being sustainable, trying to grow great cannabis.
[16:06.470 --> 16:13.310]  Are the jar lids like on our packaging, for example, our lids are made from reclaimed ocean plastic.
[16:13.310 --> 16:16.230]  And so we're we're probably one of the few groups doing that.
[16:17.630 --> 16:19.790]  SA packaging, I think, or something like that.
[16:19.790 --> 16:21.470]  Yeah, from Santa packaging.
[16:21.470 --> 16:22.870]  Yeah, they're I think they're out of Colorado.
[16:22.870 --> 16:24.470]  Yeah. And they yeah.
[16:24.470 --> 16:28.870]  Now, James is here in L.A.
[16:30.110 --> 16:33.310]  Yeah, yeah. He's one of the founders.
[16:34.150 --> 16:35.510]  Nice. James Ike.
[16:35.510 --> 16:41.550]  Yeah. And they get all the plastic from the Ocean Works Guaranteed Project, which is out of L.A.
[16:41.950 --> 16:44.470]  And they source all the reclaimed ocean plastic.
[16:46.470 --> 16:48.310]  Again, what you said, man, clean medicine.
[16:48.310 --> 16:51.990]  I'm just noticing how clean everything is that you guys are doing.
[16:51.990 --> 16:54.470]  It looks great. I appreciate it.
[16:54.510 --> 17:04.350]  Yeah. I mean, really, it's you know, it's the only it's the only way that we can, you know, keep doing this long term is to be diligent with all that stuff.
[17:04.590 --> 17:05.910]  It's great to see that you guys are doing it.
[17:07.150 --> 17:08.310]  Appreciate it. Thank you.
[17:08.590 --> 17:10.470]  Yeah, we're we're trying hard.
[17:10.470 --> 17:12.390]  You know, all of our stuff tests clean.
[17:13.070 --> 17:18.470]  We've been through multiple rounds of testing now and, you know, we're just trying to keep keep producing clean medicine.
[17:19.710 --> 17:30.120]  Oh, yeah. So someone a while ago at well, first of all, this was a question from a while ago.
[17:33.260 --> 17:40.300]  Can you see that? Does it does it does it take a commercial wood chipper to shred the cannabis stalks?
[17:40.740 --> 17:45.420]  We grow indoor plants, so ours are fairly smaller than if you were growing outdoor plants.
[17:46.340 --> 17:52.820]  Most of our stuff we can shred in a normal, basic backyard wood chipper that you get at Home Depot or anywhere.
[17:53.860 --> 17:59.060]  Occasionally, our mom plants, the base of the stock, like the bottom one foot of the stock.
[17:59.060 --> 18:02.940]  Sometimes we'll have to chop that in half to be able to fit it in our shredder.
[18:03.300 --> 18:11.940]  So most things can if you're growing at home, if you are doing large outdoor plants, you will probably need a wood chipper that can handle larger than one inch branches.
[18:12.740 --> 18:14.580]  I found that it has to be pretty dry.
[18:14.620 --> 18:20.780]  I've actually clogged my wood chipper trying to get everything chipped up and cleaned up for the season a little too fast.
[18:20.780 --> 18:25.380]  And yeah, there's a lot of what's that?
[18:25.780 --> 18:26.380]  Go ahead. Sorry.
[18:26.980 --> 18:29.100]  Oh, if there's a lot of leaf in the branches.
[18:29.100 --> 18:37.100]  So what we find is that the only way we can get stock to look like wood chips is to only use cannabis branches and no leaves.
[18:37.580 --> 18:39.940]  And so we'll separate the leaves and shred those separately.
[18:40.300 --> 18:43.980]  But to actually get it to look like wood chips, you have to just use the branches.
[18:45.340 --> 18:47.180]  And that's where there's so much more.
[18:47.500 --> 18:53.220]  There's a lot of water that's like wet in the leaves that basically it doesn't shred well.
[18:54.220 --> 19:00.660]  It just kind of like it like almost wants to puree it into the into the wood chip.
[19:00.660 --> 19:01.060]  So.
[19:03.220 --> 19:04.500]  Yep, got to let it dry out.
[19:05.260 --> 19:06.900]  Use of IPM.
[19:08.660 --> 19:10.260]  What's your IPM strategy?
[19:11.020 --> 19:16.100]  Yeah, I mean, it all starts with keeping the outside outside and the inside inside.
[19:17.460 --> 19:18.620]  That's a big part of it.
[19:19.260 --> 19:20.100]  Staying clean.
[19:20.300 --> 19:25.220]  We all wear boots in here now, and so we're not wearing our shoes inside the garden rooms.
[19:27.180 --> 19:29.260]  And that's a that's a big part of it.
[19:29.260 --> 19:36.660]  And just doing regular plant checks every day, looking at every single leaf, getting underneath the leaves where bugs will hide.
[19:37.540 --> 19:42.540]  Just really being on top of it is how you can find if you have a pest issue and then resolve it quickly.
[19:43.300 --> 19:50.660]  But also, we like I said, we make our own in-house knee mallow and hemp soap foliar spray and we spray that on.
[19:50.660 --> 19:58.100]  And we haven't done it in a while, but occasionally we'll do a compost spray just to help with the endophyte response.
[19:58.540 --> 20:08.060]  But the biggest thing is just being on top of it and being super anal about looking at all the plants every day.
[20:08.900 --> 20:10.620]  And, you know, yeah.
[20:10.620 --> 20:17.580]  And just if you see something, it's just got to get, you know, don't like don't brush it off if you see something that is a potential threat.
[20:18.420 --> 20:20.220]  Have you got any beneficials?
[20:21.500 --> 20:25.340]  Yeah, we we definitely do have predatory mites.
[20:25.620 --> 20:28.580]  We didn't like we didn't purposefully introduce them.
[20:28.580 --> 20:33.100]  I think they probably came with our worms or something else, but they're chilling, doing their thing.
[20:33.100 --> 20:37.420]  You can clean up your life and rid yourself of X's.
[20:39.420 --> 20:40.340]  Thanks for the advice.
[20:42.020 --> 20:47.860]  Hey, can we go look in that mom room and talk about what that concentrated microbiology is all about?
[20:47.860 --> 20:48.740]  That sounded pretty cool.
[20:49.780 --> 20:52.940]  Yeah, well, I've got some of the products here, but yeah, we can walk back through the mom room.
[20:52.940 --> 20:55.380]  This is some bottle products.
[20:55.900 --> 20:57.100]  Oh, yeah. It's the stuff.
[20:57.100 --> 20:58.220]  It's this stuff right here.
[20:58.860 --> 21:03.860]  Nice. A new line of concentrated biology that's been in agriculture for about 10 years.
[21:03.860 --> 21:05.140]  We're bringing into cannabis.
[21:05.140 --> 21:06.740]  I was I was just looking at this.
[21:06.740 --> 21:10.900]  I saw somebody posted up that I think I forgot.
[21:10.900 --> 21:12.380]  I might have been. I forgot who it was.
[21:12.380 --> 21:14.980]  But yeah, somebody posted that and I was looking like some good stuff.
[21:14.980 --> 21:16.260]  You mind talking about a little bit?
[21:16.900 --> 21:18.260]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[21:19.020 --> 21:20.500]  Go ahead, Tyler. You know more about it.
[21:20.500 --> 21:22.380]  I'm going to go ahead and get some more of this stuff.
[21:22.380 --> 21:23.860]  I'm going to go ahead and get some more of this stuff.
[21:23.980 --> 21:24.980]  It's pretty cool.
[21:25.660 --> 21:27.460]  Go ahead, Tyler. You know more about it, right?
[21:28.340 --> 21:30.020]  Yeah. Do you want me to talk about it?
[21:30.340 --> 21:36.980]  I think our packaging and our marketing definitely needs a major improvement to kind of show
[21:36.980 --> 21:39.500]  the concentratedness of the product.
[21:39.500 --> 21:41.620]  But it was more like, OK, this is so amazing.
[21:41.620 --> 21:43.500]  We're having such great success with it.
[21:43.700 --> 21:46.540]  Let's just get it out to the market as soon as we possibly can.
[21:47.580 --> 21:53.540]  But it's made from our own vermicompost that a partner of ours makes in his facility.
[21:53.540 --> 21:56.540]  And then brews and then puts the microbes to sleep.
[21:56.900 --> 21:59.940]  So it's a liquid microbial inoculant product.
[22:00.740 --> 22:01.740]  And you use our...
[22:03.060 --> 22:03.620]  Go ahead.
[22:03.620 --> 22:05.180]  Are they just in like a cyst form?
[22:06.820 --> 22:07.460]  I'm sorry?
[22:07.460 --> 22:09.700]  Are the microbes just in like a cyst form?
[22:11.180 --> 22:12.500]  It's called stasis.
[22:14.180 --> 22:20.420]  So the microbes have been put to sleep, just like you found ancient microbes with the Egyptians
[22:20.420 --> 22:21.980]  that have been in stasis mode.
[22:22.260 --> 22:26.540]  They're covered in a shell and they're pretty much in hibernation sleep mode.
[22:27.140 --> 22:34.540]  Once they touch water and interact with our microbe food, which is mainly kelp and calcium
[22:34.540 --> 22:38.980]  and seaweed that activates them, it gets them going and then you want to immediately use
[22:38.980 --> 22:45.980]  it. So people that are brewing, we tell them to use this at the end of the brew or just
[22:45.980 --> 22:47.100]  immediately use it.
[22:48.140 --> 22:49.340]  And we've seen great results.
[22:49.900 --> 22:51.380]  Nice. Yeah.
[22:53.500 --> 22:55.100]  I like that.
[22:56.860 --> 23:05.580]  I guess my always my big curiosity with microbes is the longevity in the bottle.
[23:06.780 --> 23:08.180]  We got a one year shelf life.
[23:08.540 --> 23:14.980]  The only problem we've had is if you have the bottle open and you mix the powders openly
[23:14.980 --> 23:19.700]  in the same room, our powders are so soluble that they turn into a dust in the air.
[23:20.020 --> 23:23.540]  And then if you got that bottle open for a while, it'll settle into the bottle and
[23:23.540 --> 23:26.300]  activate the whole bottle, which is definitely a big issue.
[23:26.620 --> 23:30.100]  So we're working on a cool sticker right now to put on the bottle that says if it
[23:30.100 --> 23:33.140]  smells or swells, don't use it and call us for replacement.
[23:34.140 --> 23:36.580]  We want to be really chill about that and helping people out.
[23:37.460 --> 23:40.100]  But the main thing about this product is its concentration rate.
[23:40.140 --> 23:43.540]  There's 20,000 different species of microbes in there.
[23:43.820 --> 23:45.780]  Many other products are going to have a handful.
[23:46.900 --> 23:53.940]  You're going to need probably about 110 gallons of the other guy's product to equal
[23:53.940 --> 23:55.460]  one gallon of our product.
[23:56.740 --> 23:57.260]  Yeah.
[23:57.860 --> 23:58.380]  Nice.
[24:00.100 --> 24:06.140]  And so, Jake, when you trial stuff, kind of how do you set it up and what do you look
[24:06.140 --> 24:06.660]  like?
[24:06.860 --> 24:07.380]  Yeah.
[24:07.380 --> 24:12.460]  So with that product, for example, Tyler sent us some samples, which was awesome.
[24:12.460 --> 24:16.060]  And so we tested it out on a couple of second cycle mother pots first.
[24:16.060 --> 24:18.740]  We had some that were not looking super great.
[24:19.020 --> 24:22.060]  We ran it on it and it definitely started to help a little bit.
[24:22.180 --> 24:24.500]  And we just need to supplement it a little more.
[24:26.020 --> 24:30.740]  And so I think we are going to start using it between cycles in our flower room, at
[24:30.740 --> 24:34.580]  least maybe once every once every cycle or every other cycle, just to really help boost
[24:34.580 --> 24:35.540]  the microbial life.
[24:36.140 --> 24:41.260]  And the one thing we're working on is just getting the PPMs up on the actual
[24:41.300 --> 24:41.820]  mix.
[24:43.820 --> 24:46.580]  But I mean, it is a solid product.
[24:46.780 --> 24:51.660]  The powder is extremely like fine and soluble.
[24:51.660 --> 24:53.420]  So Tyler is very right.
[24:53.420 --> 24:57.580]  You have to keep the liquid separated when you're mixing stuff.
[25:00.340 --> 25:05.220]  But we will mainly start like we rarely ever test products unless it's something like
[25:05.220 --> 25:09.860]  this. And so we'll test it out on a couple of other pots that are a little bit more
[25:09.900 --> 25:14.260]  dense. We'll test it out on a couple of other pots that are second cycles that have
[25:14.260 --> 25:18.500]  already exhausted some of their some of their nutrients in the pot.
[25:19.180 --> 25:24.300]  And we'll see if that that in addition with our other worm casting teas can really help
[25:24.980 --> 25:28.820]  bring life back into that into that second cycle or third cycle mother pot.
[25:29.340 --> 25:36.540]  Are you scoping? Are you scoping your stuff when like prior to adding it to the plants?
[25:36.580 --> 25:38.900]  Checking the PPM, adding it to the plants and observing.
[25:39.900 --> 25:44.220]  Yeah, mainly mainly that we're mainly checking the PPMs and.
[25:45.260 --> 25:49.580]  We're like it's we're fairly good at catching when plants are starting to look like
[25:49.580 --> 25:55.580]  they're needing stuff. And so once we realize that this plant is going to need more
[25:55.580 --> 26:01.780]  regular teas or more regular amendments, we'll start to get it on a fairly normal
[26:01.780 --> 26:06.140]  schedule. They have like once every other week or so if we're feeding teas or once every
[26:06.140 --> 26:07.380]  week, depending on what's needed.
[26:08.340 --> 26:12.740]  But yeah, it's mainly mainly looking at the health of the plant and how it's responding to
[26:12.740 --> 26:20.460]  the environment. Now, as far as like the preliminary studies, how long does the you
[26:20.460 --> 26:28.380]  know, if you give it one initial inoculation, how long does that inoculation last?
[26:28.380 --> 26:33.540]  That you know, it's it's if it doesn't dry out, the soil doesn't dry out, it should last
[26:33.540 --> 26:35.300]  for a very long time.
[26:36.540 --> 26:46.020]  Well, you know, are you guys are you guys like just inoculating one and just waiting,
[26:46.020 --> 26:47.220]  keeping the proper moisture?
[26:47.220 --> 26:54.660]  Like, have you guys got a number of how long you know, this this one colony can exist for
[26:55.060 --> 26:56.220]  in the proper conditions?
[26:57.540 --> 26:59.740]  There's a lot of trialing to be done right now.
[26:59.740 --> 27:03.540]  We generally we do DNA genomics testing.
[27:03.540 --> 27:05.940]  So there's some cool things that it's kind of expensive.
[27:05.940 --> 27:07.380]  It's like five hundred dollars a sample.
[27:07.380 --> 27:11.140]  But like, let's say you use this product on your soil.
[27:11.460 --> 27:16.860]  Well, you would want to test your soil for this for, you know, see what DNA and microbes
[27:16.860 --> 27:23.620]  are in your soil first, use this product and then track what microbe colonies are
[27:23.620 --> 27:26.780]  exploding and what's catching and what's staying and what's not.
[27:28.020 --> 27:33.620]  So hopefully in the next few years, DNA genomics testing on microbes is going to become
[27:33.620 --> 27:36.300]  a lot more affordable and usable for a lot of people.
[27:37.420 --> 27:42.420]  There's a company in Sacramento called Biomakers, and they run a really cool test on
[27:42.420 --> 27:47.940]  your soil and they look at the different populations of microbes in there and how they
[27:47.940 --> 27:50.420]  can positively or negatively affect things.
[27:51.340 --> 27:55.540]  I think Scott from Crescive Soil is kind of the one who really has brought that out and
[27:55.540 --> 27:59.220]  shown how important those those features are in your garden to track those different
[27:59.220 --> 28:01.140]  populations and see where things are going.
[28:01.900 --> 28:06.380]  But we can we've brought it down all the way to genomics DNA testing to see, you know,
[28:06.380 --> 28:12.100]  what groupings of microbes can fix nitrogen, which ones fix calcium and what those
[28:12.100 --> 28:13.780]  populations look like in our product.
[28:13.980 --> 28:16.700]  But the main reason for doing that is obviously looking for bad guys.
[28:17.860 --> 28:21.260]  There's going to be some bad guys in there, but the population is dramatically
[28:21.260 --> 28:23.740]  overpowering them and keeps them in check.
[28:25.460 --> 28:28.100]  I think the only thing we don't have in our product is nematodes.
[28:28.620 --> 28:33.180]  And we've got a lot of other amazing stuff in there that's very beneficial.
[28:34.300 --> 28:38.340]  The microbe powders are the M food and the C food and the bloom.
[28:38.940 --> 28:43.660]  That stuff is made to activate the microbes and get them going in a veg formulation or
[28:43.660 --> 28:44.860]  in a bloom formulation.
[28:45.140 --> 28:49.660]  And if you wanted to use that as a full on plant food program, like Jake was saying,
[28:49.660 --> 28:53.860]  you'd really have to pump up and put a lot more powder in there to beef up the PPM.
[28:54.220 --> 28:58.060]  But it's definitely possible to use our product as a standalone nutrient program.
[28:58.980 --> 29:05.220]  I like to see it used as a whole with a lot of other things because I feel like there's
[29:05.220 --> 29:08.460]  never one cannabis grower that uses just one straight program.
[29:08.460 --> 29:12.140]  It's always a little bit changing, a little bit morphing and stuff like that.
[29:12.140 --> 29:18.900]  So I'd encourage people to use this product to add to the diversity that they want to
[29:18.900 --> 29:20.660]  have in their garden.
[29:21.420 --> 29:22.180]  That's super cool.
[29:23.100 --> 29:25.420]  I saw that comment about the IMO.
[29:26.420 --> 29:29.980]  I got my little urban mason jar IMO going here.
[29:30.340 --> 29:31.980]  See if I can get a nice chunk out.
[29:32.740 --> 29:33.460]  Yeah, there we go.
[29:34.260 --> 29:36.260]  There's some fun for you.
[29:37.140 --> 29:37.660]  Yeah.
[29:38.100 --> 29:40.740]  So yeah, that's some oatmeal and malted barley.
[29:40.740 --> 29:41.820]  Been working on that.
[29:44.380 --> 29:46.340]  And you got a grass roots raised bed right behind you.
[29:47.180 --> 29:48.980]  Yeah, that was my night.
[29:48.980 --> 29:53.060]  Last night I was like, I probably shouldn't put this together for the video.
[29:53.100 --> 30:06.900]  I'm really curious to see because I think my main question, because I see we're kind
[30:06.900 --> 30:14.420]  of in the micro boom right now with products, Recharge, Great White, Grassroots, Mammoth.
[30:14.420 --> 30:18.620]  We got all really high quality companies that we see it works.
[30:18.620 --> 30:21.780]  The products absolutely 100% work.
[30:22.380 --> 30:26.740]  But I think what's going to be the real test is if we can inoculate something.
[30:27.260 --> 30:31.580]  And I think the important key is the hydrology post inoculation because that's, you know,
[30:31.860 --> 30:37.100]  you really got to treat it like an animal and make sure that it stays alive in that
[30:37.100 --> 30:38.140]  sense with the water.
[30:38.380 --> 30:42.740]  But, you know, if you can inoculate it once and just leave that long term, that's, you
[30:42.740 --> 30:47.380]  know, that's really, I think, going to be the standard of a quality for product.
[30:47.420 --> 30:47.940]  Yeah.
[30:47.940 --> 30:51.460]  And I think the issue that we've seen is people will go through their growing and
[30:51.460 --> 30:52.660]  harvesting process.
[30:53.060 --> 30:58.140]  And some people, you know, for a few weeks, they stop watering the soil as much or stop
[30:58.140 --> 30:59.140]  taking care of things.
[30:59.140 --> 31:01.900]  And sometimes you'll have that die off and everything like that.
[31:02.220 --> 31:03.860]  So I think that's why it's important.
[31:04.260 --> 31:08.700]  Like my irrigation system in my greenhouse is still running two or three days a week
[31:08.700 --> 31:14.060]  down there just to keep things from preventing it from drying out in between when I'm not
[31:14.060 --> 31:14.660]  using it.
[31:14.980 --> 31:19.820]  When I'm not using it because, you know, I only use my greenhouse, you know, 90 days
[31:19.820 --> 31:20.940]  out of the year pretty much.
[31:21.580 --> 31:22.980]  Yeah, that's so big.
[31:23.020 --> 31:27.980]  That's so big that I think personally, that's what I've been trying to concentrate on.
[31:27.980 --> 31:31.340]  And that's what I want to, you know, really want to focus on that.
[31:32.180 --> 31:35.540]  Leighton Morris really keyed in on is, you know, hydrology.
[31:36.140 --> 31:43.660]  So, you know, we can really, really mess things up just simply by watering, you know,
[31:43.700 --> 31:47.300]  improperly and very minute amounts.
[31:48.060 --> 31:55.060]  Yeah. Create things that look like deficiencies or nutrient excess.
[31:55.100 --> 32:00.140]  But it's, you know, just based on, you know, improper watering techniques.
[32:00.900 --> 32:07.540]  Yeah. You can throw all the amazing high tech amendments and things in the world and
[32:07.540 --> 32:09.340]  have the best operating system on paper.
[32:09.340 --> 32:12.380]  But if you don't water it right, you know, it's nothing.
[32:13.020 --> 32:14.900]  Or have the right oxygen levels, you know.
[32:15.420 --> 32:16.380]  I learned from a...
[32:17.820 --> 32:20.940]  Yep. The DO in that water specifically.
[32:21.620 --> 32:27.180]  Yeah. Gary Rabenberg, I think he was on the podcast a while back, was talking about how
[32:27.180 --> 32:30.020]  much air oxygen that the microbes need to have.
[32:30.020 --> 32:35.420]  And they have to have 200 pounds of pressure in the soil surface to really survive.
[32:35.580 --> 32:40.420]  And there's a tool that you can use to press down into your soil and check those oxygen
[32:40.420 --> 32:44.260]  levels. And that would translate out to your moisture levels as well.
[32:44.300 --> 32:49.140]  Because, you know, obviously if it was super wet, then you're going to have less oxygen in
[32:49.140 --> 32:52.940]  there. So, you know, we want to make sure we're hitting that 200 pounds of pressure.
[32:52.940 --> 32:57.380]  And that's how regenerative farming consultants, how they decide, you know, do we need
[32:57.380 --> 33:01.700]  to till this once to get things back fresh and fluffy?
[33:02.420 --> 33:04.940]  And they'll use those penetrometers to go down in there.
[33:04.940 --> 33:09.380]  And if they've got like 800 pounds of pressure, then they know, OK, we need to till once
[33:09.420 --> 33:13.180]  and get things fluffy and then never come over here again with the tractor again.
[33:13.580 --> 33:18.700]  So I think it goes from the home garden all the way to the field for sure.
[33:19.580 --> 33:25.380]  And that's now is also, you know, another really important key is sometimes,
[33:25.380 --> 33:31.820]  unfortunately, you know, when we're outside, just the quality of the soil needs the
[33:31.820 --> 33:37.260]  scarring and needs that one time till to reset.
[33:37.580 --> 33:43.180]  You know, although, yes, you're damaging the skin of the soil, it's a necessary evil to
[33:43.660 --> 33:48.220]  reset. Everything I've learned, it seems like it needs the animals, the livestock.
[33:48.220 --> 33:53.260]  You know, you need the cows, the chickens, the goats, all the nasty, dirty farm side of
[33:53.260 --> 33:57.420]  things, processing that biology and boosting it up in their stomachs and crapping it back
[33:57.420 --> 34:01.020]  out and making things, everything, plant available.
[34:01.900 --> 34:05.340]  You know, we're trying to do every portion of that we can on our farm.
[34:05.340 --> 34:09.820]  But it's very difficult to keep all the animals wrangled in their certain areas and not
[34:09.900 --> 34:11.700]  killing each other and stuff like that.
[34:12.500 --> 34:15.020]  You know, the life cycle is so interesting.
[34:16.260 --> 34:18.940]  And it's not getting away of all that same time, too, right?
[34:19.700 --> 34:23.740]  Oh, yeah. We're constantly getting in and getting away of it with our fences and our
[34:24.220 --> 34:29.420]  concrete and our posts and our new automatic gates and all kinds of weird stuff.
[34:29.420 --> 34:31.020]  We're killing the fungi with.
[34:32.020 --> 34:33.020]  All right.
[34:33.780 --> 34:38.420]  Since we were talking about tilling, can you talk
[34:38.420 --> 34:42.580]  about kind of what you do? First of all, do you have I assume you have worms in those
[34:42.580 --> 34:44.340]  super long beds, right?
[34:44.700 --> 34:48.420]  Absolutely. Yeah. So so the whole bed, it's not one solid bed.
[34:48.980 --> 34:50.620]  There's. Yeah, exactly.
[34:50.620 --> 34:52.300]  So the worms are doing the work for us.
[34:52.580 --> 34:56.260]  So it's a 24 foot long next gen table.
[34:56.260 --> 34:58.660]  And in there, there is six four by four beds.
[34:59.300 --> 35:03.780]  And so each bed we probably put in around one to two thousand worms
[35:04.340 --> 35:08.980]  when we first got the soil and we let them kind of do their thing for a little bit
[35:09.580 --> 35:14.180]  before we planted. And so, you know, they're just constantly
[35:14.380 --> 35:19.060]  breaking down the roots and creating fresh castings and improving
[35:19.620 --> 35:23.740]  the nitrogen. And even though we have a lot of worms, we're still planting clover and
[35:23.740 --> 35:28.300]  feeding peas because on the last flowering cycle, we noticed we might have been a little
[35:28.300 --> 35:32.060]  nitrogen deficient throughout part of the cycle.
[35:32.100 --> 35:36.660]  And so we're going to be reamending the beds with more worm casting teas.
[35:37.060 --> 35:41.700]  And the hard part about growing in a fixed space in a raised bed indoor is
[35:41.700 --> 35:46.820]  that we can't just continually add amendments because we're going to just overflow
[35:46.820 --> 35:48.100]  the bed eventually in soil.
[35:48.740 --> 35:53.460]  And so we're trying to do more liquid solutions
[35:53.700 --> 35:56.740]  that we're brewing ourselves and working with that.
[35:56.740 --> 36:01.460]  The concentrated biology microbe teas to really
[36:01.460 --> 36:05.740]  help feed the soil and opposed to directly feeding the plant.
[36:06.260 --> 36:08.300]  And so sometimes that. Yeah, go ahead.
[36:08.620 --> 36:12.900]  I was just going to say, and here's me, I'm all about diversity and using as many
[36:12.900 --> 36:15.460]  different products as possible because that's what Living Soil is about.
[36:15.820 --> 36:20.460]  And, you know, my products are soluble and able to flow right
[36:20.460 --> 36:23.220]  into the system. Have you tried organics alive?
[36:23.580 --> 36:26.020]  I think there's so many great things about there.
[36:26.020 --> 36:28.260]  Yeah, we have not.
[36:28.300 --> 36:31.420]  I have not ran their stuff I've seen. I think I think Build A Soil has been doing some
[36:31.420 --> 36:35.940]  tests with their stuff. But we have not ran organics alive products.
[36:36.580 --> 36:39.500]  Yeah, I think you'd really love their nitrogen source there.
[36:39.540 --> 36:43.860]  It's a soybean fermentation and it's something like
[36:44.420 --> 36:48.700]  it's just super soluble like ours and it's green and it smells so good, too.
[36:48.700 --> 36:50.020]  So. Oh, OK.
[36:50.420 --> 36:52.020]  Organics alive stuff right there.
[36:52.980 --> 36:54.140]  OK, I'll check them out.
[36:54.700 --> 36:58.380]  I'm definitely not partial to having to use one thing.
[36:59.180 --> 37:01.180]  I love using all parts of the industry.
[37:01.220 --> 37:02.220]  So.
[37:03.060 --> 37:04.060]  Nice.
[37:04.700 --> 37:06.820]  Yeah, they're FPJs. Everything's fermented.
[37:06.860 --> 37:08.300]  Everything comes from the plant.
[37:08.340 --> 37:11.620]  So it's a plant derived product.
[37:11.900 --> 37:13.820]  So that's in there.
[37:14.380 --> 37:17.060]  Where are they out of? They're by you, right, Peter?
[37:17.220 --> 37:19.540]  And yeah, they're actually Jake.
[37:19.580 --> 37:21.660]  They're south of you. They're actually that.
[37:21.700 --> 37:23.460]  Yeah, they live in Orange County.
[37:23.500 --> 37:25.860]  And I think they're there.
[37:27.020 --> 37:31.140]  So they have a big hemp farm down in San Diego County.
[37:32.140 --> 37:33.500]  OK, but.
[37:34.700 --> 37:37.780]  And they've been running the indoor living soil beds or by four.
[37:38.620 --> 37:41.100]  They've been doing four by fours for like two years now.
[37:41.660 --> 37:43.060]  They got some nice living soil.
[37:43.540 --> 37:44.540]  Of course we did.
[37:44.780 --> 37:45.780]  Where are they?
[37:46.020 --> 37:51.220]  First thing, the material to make the FPJs and all that stuff.
[37:52.220 --> 37:57.220]  I think Peter's going to have to bring a Todd from Organics Alive on and do a little show sometime, because I have no idea.
[37:57.460 --> 37:58.460]  Hell yeah.
[37:58.500 --> 37:59.500]  Well, let me text him.
[37:59.540 --> 38:00.540]  Let's see if he's.
[38:02.420 --> 38:03.420]  Give me two minutes.
[38:04.700 --> 38:12.380]  They do a lot of work with local schools and getting their products out onto baseball fields and local parks and stuff like that.
[38:12.820 --> 38:16.140]  So I love how community those guys are and how local they are.
[38:16.820 --> 38:23.300]  And, you know, getting that tee ball field looking perfect, which is something that speaks to my youth for sure.
[38:24.180 --> 38:25.180]  Nice.
[38:25.420 --> 38:32.380]  Yeah, I would love to hear what what what they're you know, what they're sourcing, you know, for the material and stuff like that.
[38:33.980 --> 38:45.020]  You know that that, you know, it looks like, you know, it sounds quality and I would love for them just to boast more quality of, you know, where the material is, you know, native from.
[38:46.740 --> 38:53.940]  Sure. And to wrap up that last thought about I think there was a question about no till and just how what we how we approach it and what we think about it.
[38:54.420 --> 38:55.420]  But basically.
[38:56.420 --> 39:04.220]  The reason we're going to be testing on this neck, we've done it one time before where we vegged in the flower room and we're going to be doing it again by just transplanting clone cubes in.
[39:04.340 --> 39:13.540]  And the reason being is we've noticed when you go through multiple cycles, you can't unless you let it till for itself for a long time and break down all the roots.
[39:13.580 --> 39:24.060]  You can't make space for a quarter gallon pot for 16 per bed because you're displacing too much soil when you're trying to do that and replant right after you harvest.
[39:24.660 --> 39:27.980]  And so we're going to be testing by by just planting in a clone cube.
[39:28.020 --> 39:29.300]  You're saving a ton of space.
[39:31.100 --> 39:39.180]  And so the reason part of the reason why we're trying to do that is to preserve the multilayer because we've been trying to build such a healthy, rich multilayer.
[39:39.660 --> 39:47.460]  And right when we go to transplant quarter gallon pots, it'll basically move all the mulch out of that section in 16 squares per bed, you know.
[39:48.100 --> 39:52.540]  And so what we're trying to do is just.
[39:54.500 --> 39:55.500]  Sorry, I'm going to phone call.
[39:55.780 --> 39:57.020]  What we're trying to do is just.
[39:59.900 --> 40:08.580]  Basically, preserve all the mulch and keep building a better multilayer and shred our own cannabis stalk and feed back into the soil what was grown out of it.
[40:08.980 --> 40:09.660]  And so.
[40:10.700 --> 40:12.380]  That's kind of how we're trying to approach it.
[40:12.420 --> 40:17.580]  We're going to see if we can successfully flower out our clones that we're harvesting.
[40:17.620 --> 40:22.420]  We've done I mean, the clones that will be vegging in the flower room and we have done it once before and we know that it works.
[40:22.820 --> 40:31.380]  And so we just need to see that we can uniformly veg them from clone and that we're not going to be deficient or stress out the clones going straight into the large beds.
[40:33.100 --> 40:33.420]  Very.
[40:33.500 --> 40:34.540]  And we've done it under.
[40:35.100 --> 40:35.780]  Yeah, no, go ahead.
[40:36.220 --> 40:55.700]  I was just going to say a very important piece that is speaking on this is when you take that soil out of the bed to plant in your new one gallon pot, that soil that you're removing from the bed and ultimately removing from the room we've seen should be isolated and tested for parasitic nematodes.
[40:56.700 --> 41:01.860]  Immediately recycling that soil back into the system has shown to cause issues.
[41:02.820 --> 41:11.500]  We've seen like I think the longest running no-till facility in Washington is something gold like gold leaf or something like that.
[41:11.860 --> 41:18.660]  And that is the one point where they had to redo their soil is when they found some parasitic nematodes and couldn't get out of that.
[41:19.020 --> 41:23.100]  And they found preventing that is by not circulating that stuff back in.
[41:23.900 --> 41:25.220]  Hey, 4K Farms.
[41:28.360 --> 41:29.440]  Hey, how's it going, guys?
[41:30.280 --> 41:30.800]  What's up?
[41:31.680 --> 41:32.800]  Got our Texas head grower.
[41:32.800 --> 41:33.840]  Live from Texas.
[41:34.560 --> 41:36.320]  I think that was Kiss Organics with Gold Leaf.
[41:36.520 --> 41:42.240]  I was listening to that on the podcast and that was incredible what they were talking about.
[41:42.640 --> 41:52.840]  Yeah, root feeding nematodes, I think was the culprit of that because they had to remove the complete quantity of their soil.
[41:52.840 --> 41:54.760]  I think if I remember correctly from the podcast.
[41:54.760 --> 41:55.240]  Damn.
[41:55.400 --> 41:57.520]  And that is just wild putting, you know.
[41:58.080 --> 41:58.400]  Yeah.
[41:59.400 --> 42:00.080]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[42:00.080 --> 42:06.960]  And that test in between it just goes to show right there that you know, you can have killer system but in the end.
[42:07.480 --> 42:13.240]  That's where we're finding those SOPs by failure.
[42:13.240 --> 42:16.240]  Unfortunately, there's somebody who had to go out there and do it and fail.
[42:16.560 --> 42:20.200]  And now the rest of the community is purely benefiting off of that.
[42:20.200 --> 42:23.680]  And I think we need to heed that information as best as possible.
[42:24.560 --> 42:27.840]  Yeah, we're definitely going to be doing more soil tests in the future.
[42:27.840 --> 42:33.960]  And so when what we were doing previously, when we were transplanting into the beds, we're not actually taking soil out.
[42:34.160 --> 42:37.040]  It just displaces it in the actual bed.
[42:37.280 --> 42:39.760]  And it just starts to raise the level of soil in the bed.
[42:40.280 --> 42:42.480]  So we didn't actually end up removing any.
[42:42.480 --> 42:45.200]  And so that's why we're trying to not have to do that.
[42:45.200 --> 42:48.480]  And so that's why we're going to be transplanting clones directly into the flower rooms.
[42:49.200 --> 42:50.320]  It'll be very important.
[42:50.360 --> 42:51.960]  And vegging in the flower room.
[42:52.520 --> 42:57.920]  And very importantly, just to run a soil test once every probably three months for parasitic nematodes.
[42:58.760 --> 42:59.400]  For sure.
[42:59.600 --> 43:00.200]  Very important.
[43:00.200 --> 43:06.920]  Did they, do you know, did that group, had they introduced nematodes in the past and they ended up getting some parasitic ones?
[43:06.920 --> 43:10.880]  Or did it just come in through the soil or through something unknown?
[43:11.480 --> 43:14.080]  You know, we would have to listen back to that podcast.
[43:14.080 --> 43:15.600]  I don't want to speculate.
[43:15.600 --> 43:17.440]  I know that was probably asked several times.
[43:17.440 --> 43:21.360]  So, you know, please go back to the KISS Organics podcast and look at that.
[43:21.360 --> 43:29.200]  But I'd imagine that it got to a point to where the population of bad nematodes just began to out-compete any new inoculations they were putting in there.
[43:29.560 --> 43:36.200]  Or it was possibly an anaerobic situation that bred those nematodes in the first place or continued to have it going.
[43:36.320 --> 43:36.800]  Right.
[43:37.200 --> 43:44.640]  I don't remember specifically what clip it was from, but there was a clip of Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[43:44.680 --> 43:50.960]  And it might have been from this last Living Soil webinar this last weekend.
[43:52.160 --> 44:00.240]  But there's a certain fungus that there was a microscope shot where the certain fungus will wrap around the root eating nematode.
[44:01.280 --> 44:05.280]  And I do believe it is a predator of that root eating nematode.
[44:06.400 --> 44:14.320]  So to keep those levels, you know, high, to keep those root eating nematodes at bay is also, you know, so, so important to have that good balance.
[44:14.800 --> 44:23.280]  I think that's why so many people jumped on the whole meme wagon so hard is because they hear it can kill those nematodes and kill that bad fungi and stuff like that.
[44:23.280 --> 44:29.200]  But I think people can easily overuse those products and hurt their beneficial populations as well.
[44:29.760 --> 44:33.840]  And yeah, no need no need to kill everything if you're just trying to target one.
[44:33.920 --> 44:38.800]  There's, you know, there's something out there in the natural cycle that will balance it out.
[44:38.800 --> 44:39.760]  You just have to look for it.
[44:40.720 --> 44:41.200]  Yeah.
[44:42.000 --> 44:51.040]  Jake, just Jake, just quickly someone a while ago asked top kind of top soil amendments during flower cycle.
[44:51.840 --> 44:59.760]  Right. So we will we will generally if we're going to need to to help the soil out and we're going to feed a tea or something,
[44:59.760 --> 45:05.760]  we will we will take those dry amendments and brew them into a worm casting tea and then water them out.
[45:06.320 --> 45:11.440]  Just because when you're working with all these dry amendments, they're so powdery and dry.
[45:11.440 --> 45:16.400]  And when you're in a flower room that's in flower, there's fans and AC and everything moving so much air.
[45:16.400 --> 45:22.000]  And that stuff will just I mean, we haven't done it, but it will just poof up and hit the buds.
[45:22.000 --> 45:27.360]  So we will water we will hand water a worm casting tea that has different dry amendments in it.
[45:27.360 --> 45:29.920]  If we're going to need to supplement in flower.
[45:29.920 --> 45:34.400]  Otherwise, we're trying to mainly feed teas between cycles and maybe in the first several weeks.
[45:35.760 --> 45:41.200]  And then if we need it a few weeks in, we'll add in like maybe like week four or five.
[45:41.200 --> 45:44.240]  If we see we're going to need another tea, we'll hand water one in.
[45:44.240 --> 45:47.200]  Otherwise, we're just watering through the garden grids with RO water.
[45:48.320 --> 45:50.000]  Now you said you got worms going, right?
[45:51.360 --> 45:54.240]  What kind of worms do you have in those beds?
[45:54.240 --> 45:56.320]  Yeah, we're running a red wiggler worms.
[45:56.320 --> 45:58.800]  So we got all the red wigglers from Uncle Jim's worm farm.
[46:02.480 --> 46:05.280]  Have you thought of adding other worms that go deeper?
[46:06.720 --> 46:07.280]  We haven't.
[46:08.240 --> 46:10.160]  We haven't added in our soil.
[46:10.160 --> 46:12.720]  We only have about maybe 12 to 16 inches of soil.
[46:12.720 --> 46:14.640]  So we might add in some more.
[46:14.640 --> 46:18.080]  But those red wigglers are going all the way through that.
[46:18.080 --> 46:21.360]  Yeah, they're definitely definitely doing the work.
[46:21.360 --> 46:24.880]  It seems like you messed around with any avocado tech.
[46:26.640 --> 46:28.400]  No, I have not.
[46:30.320 --> 46:31.760]  You don't have to use avocados.
[46:31.760 --> 46:32.960]  You could use like anything.
[46:33.680 --> 46:37.440]  Yes, whatever is native, whatever is local.
[46:41.840 --> 46:42.960]  Yeah, no, I've seen it.
[46:42.960 --> 46:43.440]  I haven't.
[46:44.400 --> 46:45.200]  It's interesting.
[46:45.760 --> 46:46.320]  Definitely.
[46:47.280 --> 46:48.640]  Difficult on a commercial scale.
[46:48.640 --> 46:51.680]  Yeah, no, don't put that in your facility right now, bro.
[46:54.400 --> 46:54.900]  Right.
[46:55.760 --> 46:56.560]  No, it's great, though.
[46:56.560 --> 46:57.280]  We love worms.
[46:58.400 --> 46:59.200]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[46:59.200 --> 47:00.720]  I mean, that's our logo.
[47:00.720 --> 47:02.320]  This is what our packaging looks like.
[47:02.320 --> 47:03.680]  So we got the worm on the top.
[47:04.400 --> 47:09.920]  It's a cannabis flower cultivated in living cultivated in living soil.
[47:14.800 --> 47:17.440]  Sponsoring a lot of skateboarders, too, out there on the street.
[47:17.440 --> 47:20.000]  So yeah, we got a bunch of homies that are skating.
[47:20.000 --> 47:21.680]  So they rep us super tough.
[47:21.680 --> 47:23.520]  We'll give them some shirts and stuff.
[47:23.520 --> 47:24.800]  Yeah, so we're stoked with them.
[47:27.520 --> 47:28.020]  Nice.
[47:28.580 --> 47:32.580]  I did no-till inside a shipping container back in the days.
[47:32.580 --> 47:36.180]  Two long beds in insulated beds, Soma style.
[47:37.380 --> 47:37.880]  Nice.
[47:38.580 --> 47:39.300]  It's awesome.
[47:39.300 --> 47:43.380]  Jake, do you have any rooms that aren't built out yet or partially built out?
[47:44.260 --> 47:46.340]  Yeah, I got an empty one I could show you right now.
[47:48.340 --> 47:49.940]  If you'd like to see an empty room.
[47:49.940 --> 47:51.220]  I'd love to see an empty room.
[47:52.020 --> 47:52.520]  Sure.
[47:53.460 --> 47:56.020]  It's like I'd love to see some tents.
[47:56.660 --> 48:00.020]  This is our back hallway, too.
[48:00.020 --> 48:01.220]  We got some water tanks.
[48:01.780 --> 48:03.940]  The little dab pump.
[48:03.940 --> 48:08.420]  I just installed all this like two months ago, maybe.
[48:08.420 --> 48:09.060]  So we run all the...
[48:10.340 --> 48:11.380]  We do all the work in-house.
[48:11.380 --> 48:13.540]  I built the whole facility from the ground up.
[48:17.300 --> 48:18.580]  Looks nice, Jake.
[48:18.580 --> 48:19.540]  It's really good.
[48:19.540 --> 48:20.340]  Appreciate it.
[48:20.340 --> 48:21.140]  Thank you.
[48:21.140 --> 48:24.420]  Yeah, the only thing we contracted was our electrical and mechanical.
[48:24.500 --> 48:25.780]  So the AC work.
[48:26.500 --> 48:30.260]  And then we built all the walls, all the plumbing, all the concrete.
[48:30.260 --> 48:32.100]  So this is what a flower room will look like.
[48:33.700 --> 48:35.220]  We got an extra tank in here.
[48:35.220 --> 48:35.860]  How tall are those?
[48:35.860 --> 48:36.360]  So we got...
[48:37.620 --> 48:39.140]  They're 12 feet tall.
[48:39.140 --> 48:39.640]  Nice.
[48:41.940 --> 48:42.440]  I like the room.
[48:44.100 --> 48:46.100]  What kind of lighting do you plan to go with?
[48:48.020 --> 48:50.260]  Like the grow lights or what's in here right now?
[48:50.980 --> 48:51.540]  Oh, yeah.
[48:51.540 --> 48:53.460]  Well, right now we're running 1000 Watt Covetos.
[48:54.420 --> 48:56.020]  In this room, we're going to test out...
[48:58.340 --> 48:59.140]  We're going to test...
[48:59.140 --> 49:00.260]  Sorry, can you guys still see me?
[49:00.260 --> 49:01.620]  Okay, I don't know if the internet's cutting out.
[49:02.500 --> 49:03.620]  Yeah, we see you.
[49:04.580 --> 49:05.380]  Yeah, okay, cool.
[49:07.620 --> 49:09.300]  We're going to test out in this room.
[49:09.300 --> 49:13.460]  We're going to do some R&D testing on a couple LEDs just to get our feet in the water.
[49:14.020 --> 49:19.380]  And once we decide we like one and we're able to afford to build out on everything,
[49:19.380 --> 49:20.260]  we're going to do...
[49:20.260 --> 49:22.900]  If we like the LEDs, we're going to do a full room of LEDs in here.
[49:24.020 --> 49:26.500]  And this would be our third flower room.
[49:26.500 --> 49:27.620]  And then we have two more.
[49:27.620 --> 49:33.060]  So depending on how we do in this next year and our city taxes and all that,
[49:33.060 --> 49:35.140]  if we can get one more room going, we will.
[49:35.140 --> 49:38.900]  And then after that, we'll be able to get the next two within like a couple years.
[49:42.780 --> 49:43.280]  Nice.
[49:43.900 --> 49:45.260]  Let's connect after the show.
[49:45.980 --> 49:48.700]  I can help you out with some fluid lights too.
[49:48.700 --> 49:49.980]  We'd love to do a trial in there.
[49:51.500 --> 49:52.700]  Oh, okay, nice.
[49:52.700 --> 49:55.100]  Is it like the spider?
[49:55.100 --> 49:55.740]  Is that what it is?
[49:57.020 --> 49:58.060]  The Fluent Spider?
[49:58.060 --> 50:00.460]  Well, you're going to be a single tier.
[50:00.460 --> 50:04.460]  You don't want to go with the Viper light, which is basically...
[50:04.460 --> 50:05.180]  The Viper light?
[50:06.060 --> 50:06.860]  You know, if you're planning...
[50:07.500 --> 50:08.220]  Yeah, exactly.
[50:08.220 --> 50:13.100]  If you're planning like a double-ended HPS, top light, single tier,
[50:13.100 --> 50:15.740]  you're going to want those Vipers from Fluent.
[50:17.740 --> 50:18.460]  Okay, nice.
[50:19.340 --> 50:22.220]  Yeah, I've seen that brand out there.
[50:23.100 --> 50:24.300]  Yeah, there's a lot more popping up.
[50:24.300 --> 50:29.020]  So we're going to have to just test out a few of them and really see what's going to work best for us.
[50:30.620 --> 50:32.860]  Now, as far as HPS...
[50:32.860 --> 50:34.140]  Well, actually, just hold on.
[50:34.860 --> 50:38.780]  Here's just to wrap up that last question so I can move along in the chat.
[50:41.340 --> 50:44.780]  Yeah, does No-Till Kings add phosphorus during flower stage?
[50:45.740 --> 50:48.140]  So that's kind of part two of...
[50:48.140 --> 50:48.640]  Sure.
[50:49.040 --> 50:53.360]  Yeah, so we're not top dressing with like Seabird Guano,
[50:53.360 --> 50:56.480]  but we do put some Seabird Guano into our teas occasionally.
[50:57.840 --> 51:04.000]  So that's how we would be adding in phosphorus is via Seabird Guano in our worm casting teas.
[51:06.080 --> 51:11.280]  So actually, interestingly, yes, I think I know I've been...
[51:11.280 --> 51:12.320]  I did work with...
[51:14.400 --> 51:14.900]  Oh, God.
[51:15.620 --> 51:18.180]  Derek from RII...
[51:20.580 --> 51:24.820]  Because California is passing laws that basically are pushing things in a direction.
[51:24.820 --> 51:25.460]  So that is...
[51:27.300 --> 51:28.420]  Oh, wait, sorry.
[51:28.420 --> 51:29.060]  That's the wrong...
[51:29.780 --> 51:31.220]  People are like, what's he talking about?
[51:31.940 --> 51:33.220]  That's the one I meant to put up.
[51:34.980 --> 51:35.480]  Oh, yeah.
[51:36.100 --> 51:39.220]  It's a proposition by the California Utility Commission.
[51:40.180 --> 51:40.680]  Right.
[51:41.140 --> 51:42.740]  It's a proposed regulation.
[51:45.540 --> 51:47.540]  Okay, so go ahead.
[51:47.540 --> 51:48.660]  You were going to say something?
[51:51.540 --> 51:55.380]  Yeah, I was asking, what are you doing for HVAC in that room?
[51:55.380 --> 51:58.580]  I saw that you had the overhead ducting,
[51:58.580 --> 52:02.260]  but were you running any oscillating fans in the future or anything like that?
[52:02.900 --> 52:03.620]  Oh, yeah.
[52:03.620 --> 52:04.580]  Well, sure, sure.
[52:04.580 --> 52:07.780]  So that room is totally not built out yet.
[52:07.780 --> 52:08.280]  One of our...
[52:08.980 --> 52:12.580]  Our one flower room, so it has no fans or no dehumidifiers or anything.
[52:13.060 --> 52:16.980]  Our one flower room right now, we're running all wall fans.
[52:16.980 --> 52:19.780]  So oscillating wall fans, 16 inch wall fans.
[52:19.780 --> 52:21.460]  There's 10 of them in one of the rooms.
[52:21.460 --> 52:21.960]  Yeah.
[52:24.180 --> 52:25.460]  That's working fairly well.
[52:26.500 --> 52:28.500]  Depending on the time of the year in Long Beach,
[52:28.500 --> 52:32.100]  because we have such massive humidity differences outside,
[52:32.660 --> 52:36.660]  it does slightly vary how the air is inside.
[52:36.660 --> 52:40.420]  And so sometimes in the year in that room,
[52:40.420 --> 52:43.060]  we've noticed humidity can get a little bit high
[52:43.060 --> 52:44.820]  because we're not moving enough air.
[52:44.820 --> 52:47.060]  So in the room one that we're flowering in right now,
[52:47.060 --> 52:50.820]  I've got four 12 inch max fans up over...
[52:50.820 --> 52:52.180]  Basically, there's one per row.
[52:55.220 --> 52:58.020]  So what's happening with that is
[52:58.020 --> 53:02.100]  it's definitely controlling the humidity better by moving a lot more air.
[53:02.100 --> 53:05.940]  But we're in sometimes of the year, it might be drying it out too much.
[53:05.940 --> 53:07.860]  So we have like a humidifier in there right now
[53:08.580 --> 53:10.020]  for the first three weeks of flower.
[53:11.220 --> 53:15.940]  But yeah, the fans, we're testing different fan orientations,
[53:15.940 --> 53:20.740]  especially with living soil and so much moisture content in the room.
[53:21.620 --> 53:27.060]  Like humidity control is a huge, huge thing that has to be accounted for.
[53:28.900 --> 53:30.900]  So yeah, once I rotate, basically,
[53:30.900 --> 53:33.300]  once I get the second flower room that has nothing growing,
[53:33.300 --> 53:36.020]  it just has all the soil in it that we just harvested.
[53:36.020 --> 53:39.380]  We're going to rotate the lights, cut four of them out in that room.
[53:39.380 --> 53:43.140]  And then we're going to test it again with running the same wall fan,
[53:43.140 --> 53:44.340]  the oscillating wall fans.
[53:44.900 --> 53:46.180]  And we're going to see if we can...
[53:46.900 --> 53:50.580]  If we like our temperatures and we like our humidities using those fans.
[53:50.580 --> 53:54.500]  And if not, we're going to transfer and use the overhead max fans
[53:54.500 --> 53:55.620]  because they move a ton of air.
[53:57.620 --> 54:02.180]  Nice. What do you guys run in for BPD in your rooms?
[54:03.780 --> 54:08.180]  Oh, like our sensors, like we use Trollmaster to control our sensors.
[54:08.180 --> 54:10.900]  And so everything is connected to the light.
[54:11.540 --> 54:16.660]  And so we have two Trollmaster controllers in each room,
[54:16.660 --> 54:18.340]  one on one side, one on the other side of the room.
[54:18.900 --> 54:24.660]  And our dehumidifiers, I wired everything to the HS1 controller,
[54:24.660 --> 54:27.700]  which ties into the main controller.
[54:27.700 --> 54:30.180]  And that links to the temperature three in one sensor.
[54:30.820 --> 54:33.780]  And so we're now like, I figured this out a while ago.
[54:33.780 --> 54:36.260]  So we were able to control the...
[54:36.260 --> 54:41.620]  We can change our humidity set points for the light cycle and the dark cycle.
[54:43.700 --> 54:45.940]  And it just, it took a minute in the beginning to like,
[54:46.580 --> 54:47.940]  communicate all that in our head.
[54:47.940 --> 54:50.100]  And we'd try, like, yeah, you talk to the hydrosphere guys
[54:50.100 --> 54:51.940]  and they kind of know what they're going to tell you about it.
[54:52.580 --> 54:54.340]  And they're, you know, they just hand you like,
[54:54.340 --> 54:55.700]  you just, once you kind of do it a bunch
[54:55.700 --> 54:57.780]  and you have a bunch of dehus and you're hooking them all up,
[54:58.340 --> 55:02.420]  it gets, you really start to understand how everything connects and communicates.
[55:04.420 --> 55:08.340]  And just quickly, there was a comment a while ago that,
[55:08.340 --> 55:10.660]  if you have the skills to build that whole facility,
[55:12.180 --> 55:16.340]  how many people, because you can buy so many component parts for things.
[55:17.300 --> 55:20.740]  If you can build a facility, you can 100% build a frame for LED.
[55:21.460 --> 55:22.580]  I'm sure you could do this.
[55:24.260 --> 55:27.860]  And it's just, until you're doing it legitimately, it's, I mean,
[55:29.460 --> 55:33.060]  to build out 8,000 square feet and then deck it out with lights
[55:33.060 --> 55:34.820]  and build all the framework for everything.
[55:34.820 --> 55:39.940]  I mean, you can get in over your head really easily by trying to save a few dollars.
[55:39.940 --> 55:41.540]  Not to say that that's not a good approach.
[55:41.540 --> 55:44.340]  That could be a better approach than what we're doing.
[55:44.340 --> 55:47.860]  But once you're actually doing it and you're in the thick of it,
[55:48.660 --> 55:51.300]  you know, a commercial build out,
[55:51.300 --> 55:56.100]  there's so many unknowns and so many things that pop up that you didn't anticipate.
[55:56.740 --> 56:02.020]  And yeah, I mean, what we've learned is sometimes,
[56:02.020 --> 56:06.420]  like a lot of, sometimes it is great and you can save a lot of money doing things a certain way,
[56:06.420 --> 56:09.860]  but other times you end up spending more money just,
[56:09.860 --> 56:13.140]  and that's very arbitrary and anecdotal, but, you know,
[56:14.580 --> 56:19.620]  you can spend a lot more money by not trying to do the legitimate route.
[56:22.180 --> 56:25.060]  Not to say that those boards and making your own lights is bad or anything.
[56:25.060 --> 56:28.820]  It's just sometimes on a commercial level, it's challenging to do all that.
[56:29.060 --> 56:30.180]  And then we have...
[56:32.180 --> 56:32.740]  Give me one sec.
[56:33.380 --> 56:34.420]  Hey Noah, can you get the gate?
[56:36.340 --> 56:42.810]  Oh, I didn't see what the last one, what was the one not to mention insurance?
[56:42.810 --> 56:44.970]  Most states require LEDs to be certified.
[56:46.010 --> 56:48.490]  Yeah, like, like they got to be UL listed and all that.
[56:51.530 --> 56:58.330]  I saw a comment earlier about the mix, the mixture of the two from somebody.
[56:58.330 --> 56:58.890]  Oh yeah.
[56:58.890 --> 57:00.890]  Yeah, I'm fucking around with that in one of the tents right now.
[57:00.890 --> 57:10.570]  I got a CMH and a 260 watt far red bars from HLG and doing some cool stuff.
[57:10.570 --> 57:11.070]  Nice.
[57:12.890 --> 57:13.850]  What's going on with you, man?
[57:13.850 --> 57:17.290]  You're in a warehouse there with different tents and obviously
[57:17.850 --> 57:23.050]  better way of controlling your VPD and all that stuff.
[57:23.050 --> 57:25.290]  That's a point I wanted to make.
[57:25.850 --> 57:29.130]  Jake's setup is he's got a whole bunch of small rooms
[57:29.130 --> 57:34.090]  and I'm sure that's because they're super easy to control compared to a big room.
[57:35.290 --> 57:36.010]  Yup.
[57:37.690 --> 57:38.250]  100%.
[57:39.370 --> 57:43.690]  The one thing, one thing about this space right now is, you know, I'm in a, you know,
[57:43.690 --> 57:48.810]  I am in a big warehouse, but the thing is, is that's not really the easiest space to control.
[57:48.810 --> 57:52.970]  And that's kind of a lesson that I've learned with, you know, the location where I live.
[57:52.970 --> 58:02.930]  a lesson that I've learned with the location selection is really plan ahead. Because I'm
[58:02.930 --> 58:09.010]  running a million different HVAC systems to try to regulate what I need inside my tents
[58:09.010 --> 58:21.410]  to defer the outside environment within a warehouse right now. But yeah, a room is nice
[58:21.410 --> 58:22.410]  for sure.
[58:22.410 --> 58:33.450]  So just quickly to answer our Organics Alive questions, we have Eric from Organics Alive.
[58:33.450 --> 58:40.210]  So these guys had some questions for you. So who had the question?
[58:40.210 --> 58:43.890]  Fire away. How are you guys doing this morning?
[58:43.890 --> 58:49.130]  It sounds so killer that you can get a FPJ in a bottle. I'm just curious where the native
[58:49.130 --> 58:55.480]  materials source from?
[58:55.480 --> 58:56.480]  He's very frozen.
[58:56.480 --> 59:02.720]  A little bit. I couldn't hear you on the question.
[59:02.720 --> 59:12.350]  Where's the plant material and the FPJ coming from on your guys' product line?
[59:12.350 --> 59:15.790]  I'm loving his background though.
[59:16.670 --> 59:28.750]  So where's the plant material coming from on your product line, the FPJ? Can you hear
[59:28.750 --> 59:29.750]  me Eric?
[59:29.750 --> 59:32.750]  Tell him to shut off the video.
[59:32.750 --> 59:36.550]  Okay. All right. Ask the question one last time.
[59:36.550 --> 59:44.950]  Okay. I'm just curious, where's the plant material coming from with your guys' FPJs?
[59:45.910 --> 59:51.190]  We have multiple different sources. They're all non-GMO source grain and seed. So yeah,
[59:51.190 --> 59:54.950]  we have multiple sources that we're getting it from.
[59:54.950 --> 01:00:08.870]  Nice. Now, I guess the main concern as a small time grower is I only am going to use a small
[01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:15.990]  amount for my few plants. How long is that product going to be beneficial? Is there
[01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.990]  kind of an offer?
[01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.990]  Like shelf life?
[01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:23.190]  Is there, you know, does it, you know, we're really good in the first X amount of time
[01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:29.190]  and then the efficacy is reduced in this certain amount of time. And then at this point, it's
[01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:33.670]  just not worth it unless you get a new product on the shelf.
[01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:41.110]  No, we've stabilized it. It's 100% stabilized and it's been on the shelf for years, really.
[01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:49.030]  I have had bottles of our FPF for, gosh, going on four years now and it's still just as effective
[01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:55.030]  our first batches as it was, you know, when we first made it. Absolutely. Yes, we have
[01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:57.030]  it stabilized.
[01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:59.510]  Awesome.
[01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:05.910]  And where in SoCal are you right now with that dramatic and lush background?
[01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:09.510]  I'm in our office town of San Clemente.
[01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:14.070]  Got it. It looks like you're in Hawaii or something.
[01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:16.070]  I wish.
[01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:23.030]  Cool. All right. Well, thank you, Eric. Anyone have any more questions for Eric?
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:30.780]  No, we're going to hopefully look into some of the products and testing out here at our facility.
[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:36.860]  That'd be great. Feel free to reach out to us anytime. We'd love to help you out with
[01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:40.220]  any questions and yeah, any material you need to work with.
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:42.300]  Yeah, I'll connect you guys.
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:44.540]  Awesome.
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.940]  We'll let Eric get back to his day.
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:47.500]  Thanks, Eric.
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.620]  Likewise, guys. Nice talking to you. Anytime.
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:51.740]  See ya.
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:52.220]  Thanks.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:57.500]  Just a great way to get nitrogen into your soil. Very soluble. So that's why that whole
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.140]  thing came up.
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:01:59.900]  All right.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:06.700]  That's really cool. And it would be, you know, it would be so cool if, you know, they would
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:12.460]  maybe shout out some of the places that, you know, the native materials coming from.
[01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:14.300]  Should have said that while he was there.
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:21.500]  But yeah, I guess just, you know, as an individual home grower, you know, with a
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:28.300]  limited amount of plants, you know, for me personally, when it gets down to that level,
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:36.220]  I would love to know where that plant material is coming from, you know, on a personal level.
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:39.180]  Like, you know, to keep that working, I guess.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:48.680]  So you want to walk us around your facility or your home grow?
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.800]  Let's see. I think I got enough battery life for a little road tour here.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:05.000]  I got this one right here. This is just a 4x8.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:13.000]  So these are my four IT plants.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  Hold on. You froze.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.440]  So this is all.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.000]  Hold on. He froze for everyone else too, right?
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  There we go.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  Yeah, yeah, it was frozen.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  Can you guys see all right?
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  Yep. Now we're okay.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  Cool.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  Yeah, so this is a really killer phenotype.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  I think it's a Hindu Kus, but it has a really crazy, almost, I don't know if anybody's ever smoked a super lemon haze.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  But I think it's greenhouse, greenhouse, or strain hunters, greenhouse genetics, or something like that have the super lemon haze.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  So this is a super lemon skunk. It has a really heavy limonene terpene profile that this really takes after.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  And I unfortunately smoked all the blood off the first plant that came down last week.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  But as you can see, everything's starting to stack up.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  It's the first week for these two right here.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  I don't know how well you guys can see everything.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  I got the laptop flipped around so I'm not able to see too well.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  So these two are that Kush.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  This one right here is that same strain, just it's a week ahead.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  Our sorry cultivar. I shouldn't say the S word these days.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  And then this one right here, this really chunky one, this is a pre-98 Bubba.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  So this is a pre-98 Bubba that I got.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:18.050]  I got this cut when it was pre-98 Bubba.
[01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:20.050]  It looks pretty nice.
[01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:24.050]  It's the first week of flower, so you know, always going to try to find out.
[01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:36.050]  So this whole lineup right here was, this was all closet started.
[01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:40.050]  Hell yeah.
[01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:48.050]  This was started all in a bedroom, with some trunks and the whole nine yards.
[01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:52.050]  Finally made it to a nice area where I could set up.
[01:05:52.050 --> 01:05:56.050]  They're in these large nursery pots.
[01:05:56.050 --> 01:06:00.050]  It's a custom mix of soil.
[01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:08.050]  This whole operation is pretty cowboy, cowboy from the hip style.
[01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:16.050]  This is my first year I started growing, let's see, this past January.
[01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:20.050]  So right when we flipped, I was just like, all right, I got some bag seed, let's do it.
[01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:24.050]  And killed everything for the first few months.
[01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:32.050]  And then actually through you guys, the Future Canvas Project, started really getting into it.
[01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:38.050]  And then, yeah, just kind of started growing in my room.
[01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:42.050]  And then that didn't work out too well.
[01:06:42.050 --> 01:06:50.050]  And so I talked to Guy, and we got an area where we're able to set up.
[01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:54.050]  He has some space.
[01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:58.050]  So yeah, so those are my personal plants.
[01:06:58.050 --> 01:07:02.050]  Those are the fun ones.
[01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:10.050]  My mix is, I think a couple of them are cocoa, perlite, initial mix.
[01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:14.050]  And I've been doing everything.
[01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:16.050]  The whole thing is the experiment.
[01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:21.050]  Everything has been, you know, oh shit, something's this.
[01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:22.050]  Now I got to do this.
[01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:24.050]  And I did this.
[01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:29.050]  And I didn't want to, you know, the whole nine yards of trying to work my way through it.
[01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:36.050]  As of right now, it's really, I've just been trying to water appropriately.
[01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:43.050]  I'm starting to add cover crops and really just trying to be hands off right now.
[01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:46.050]  This is happening a little bit here.
[01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:50.050]  There's a little bit of, I don't know if you guys can see.
[01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:51.050]  I don't know how well you can see it.
[01:07:51.050 --> 01:08:01.050]  But there's some purpling on the stem, a little purpling streaks, which I think is just mineral hungry.
[01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:09.050]  I'm assuming my soil is drying out too much and my biology is not, you know, delivering the adequate amount of minerals and whatnot.
[01:08:09.050 --> 01:08:14.050]  So those ones are, I just sent them in the flower.
[01:08:14.050 --> 01:08:17.050]  It's all bag seed genetic.
[01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:18.050]  Minus the one cut.
[01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:26.050]  So it's not, you know, anything terribly, terribly heartbroken about.
[01:08:26.050 --> 01:08:41.050]  So the space that I'm working at, the guy wants to eventually turn into an indoor hemp operation and do his whole CBD thing.
[01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:48.050]  And we got connected and he knew that I was interested in growing.
[01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:57.050]  He said, well, if you can, you know, help me get this hemp thing going, you can have a little space for your.
[01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:59.050]  So that's what we got going on.
[01:08:59.050 --> 01:09:09.050]  So I've been throwing all the experiments onto the, you know, hemp and then going from the hemp to my, you know, core plants as long as it passes the test.
[01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:19.050]  So all the, so this is all a hemp auto off of, what was the website?
[01:09:19.050 --> 01:09:23.050]  I think he got it off of Seedsman's.
[01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:30.050]  He had picked out some CBD, you know, the high CBD.
[01:09:31.050 --> 01:09:37.050]  I think that's the 0.3% THC for the hemp.
[01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:39.050]  As far as the COA stuff goes.
[01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:43.050]  But this is kind of where I've been doing all my experiments and stuff.
[01:09:43.050 --> 01:09:48.050]  So I started some avocado tech with some cover crops here.
[01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:56.050]  I got some radish and I think there's going to be some wheatgrass coming up as well.
[01:09:56.050 --> 01:10:00.050]  But the worms here.
[01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:04.050]  Yeah, they're pretty much gone back into the soil.
[01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:12.050]  They came up before when I had some avocado tech running on these guys.
[01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:15.050]  They were liking that. I got another round going here.
[01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:18.050]  But this is, they're loving it.
[01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:32.050]  This is a really fun kind of experiment to be able to, you know, not have too much vested and if something goes haywire, it's not the end of the world.
[01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:35.050]  So I've been able to try some crazy, some crazy things.
[01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:44.050]  And, you know, you can kind of see all over that there's, you know, some plants are, you know, kind of burnt at the tips here.
[01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:50.050]  This one got way too much light at one point.
[01:10:50.050 --> 01:10:58.050]  And just really, you know, kind of just cutting my teeth on just growing and just trying everything, you know.
[01:10:58.050 --> 01:11:08.050]  And I'm really trying to take what, you know, you guys have put out on here and just do it and just apply it and see what works.
[01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:13.280]  Something's got to stick.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.280]  You're influencing culture, Peter.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:21.280]  Dude, Peter, 100 percent shout out to Peter right now, because literally that's why I'm doing all of this.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:28.280]  I was, you know, cooped up in quarantine and had my couple of bag seeds going and I was like, this is kind of cool.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.280]  And I kind of want to get into it.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.280]  So, you know, 22 years old, the generation that YouTube's everything.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:44.280]  So I typed in, you know, how to grow cannabis and some some like actually cool like cats were talking about things on the future cannabis project.
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:54.280]  Because, you know, you get a lot of guys that aren't really like they're not really, you know, like heavy weed smokers, I guess, where they're like actually a part of the culture.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:57.280]  You know, they're out here really doing the thing.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:01.280]  And yeah. Oh, 100 percent BCB for sure.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:05.280]  Yeah, that was a that was a you know, how I got into it was a piece of cannabis.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.280]  So shout out Peter.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.280]  Thank you. We would we would be heavy smokers if you weren't so busy.
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.280]  So I just want to say that. No, no, no.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:15.280]  I'm just I'm just talking shit and you don't got to be a heavy smoker.
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.280]  You can still, you know, you know, whatever.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:22.280]  But, you know, he's got he's got he's got a he's got a finger on the pulse.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.280]  So like what's really going on? Yeah.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.280]  Cool. It's super cool.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:31.280]  Appreciated. So we were joking in the chat.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.280]  Your video is a little I mean, we saw glimpses of the grow, but it was a little choppy.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.280]  But my phone, because I had my I had my laptop like this.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:45.280]  I was like, oh, yeah. Why don't you why don't you jump off and come back on on the phone?
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:49.280]  And we'll see if that's better. And we'll we'll move around the horn.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.280]  It's like getting roasted in the chat.
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:56.280]  Now, as I told everybody, it's like we turned it into a radio show.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.280]  So just enjoy it. I think people should know.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.280]  I'll get on my phone real quick. All right. OK. See you.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:05.280]  OK. Oh, now I see all the chat questions.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.280]  I didn't even know. I see all the comments.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:18.130]  Um, well, should we should we go to our Texas correspondent?
[01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:20.130]  You got to unmute yourself. There you go.
[01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:27.980]  Can you can can you flip your phone 90 degrees like a TV?
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:31.980]  Oh, there we go. Perfect. All right.
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:35.980]  Is that better? Yeah. Is that better?
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:38.980]  Yeah, that sure is. Look at that. You fill up the whole screen.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:47.250]  Yeah. See right up your nostrils. Damn it.
[01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:53.250]  Yeah, man. Welcome to my little backyard paradise.
[01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:57.250]  I don't know where my damn camera is. There we go.
[01:13:57.250 --> 01:14:00.250]  Don't need to show you my nose hair. So what's up, guys?
[01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:05.250]  I'm with I'm Taylor. I'm with 4K Farm. We're one of the, you know,
[01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:09.250]  recent licensed hemp producers here in the state of Texas.
[01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:12.250]  So I got licensed back in May.
[01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:17.250]  And, you know, it's a point three total THC state.
[01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:22.250]  So it's following the interim final rules, USDA final rules.
[01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:27.250]  So unlike a lot of other states that have been growing for a while and,
[01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:30.250]  you know, held at the Delta nine were total THC.
[01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:36.250]  So compliance is a big concern here. And that's why it shows the variety I grow.
[01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:41.250]  It's a CBG variety called Janet's G. It's been great.
[01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:47.250]  So far, I'll show you guys. I got a second batch that going right now on our grass roots beds.
[01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:55.250]  Fantastic. First batch harvested last weekend and got that hang dry and it's almost done.
[01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:59.250]  Ready for deep. Ready for bucking and curing.
[01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:06.250]  So I've got a little Wi-Fi signal now. Hopefully everything's coming through clear.
[01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:11.250]  And when I go into my shop, it may cut out. So that's the that's the questionable part.
[01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:16.250]  But we'll see. Yeah, if you want. I mean, I can give you a tour of the facility,
[01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:20.250]  the greenhouse, show you the beds and the plants. Let's do it.
[01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:27.250]  So one thing, one thing, if you want to flip your camera, so it's you're using the outward facing camera.
[01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:33.250]  I think you tap on the little sprocket cog that the cam there's it says cam mic.
[01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:38.250]  And then there's a little sprocket and you can pick your camera source, which would be the not the camera facing you,
[01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:43.250]  but the camera facing away from you. It's like a dropdown with four different options.
[01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:50.250]  Look at that. Oh, my God. Is he a pro? I thought he nailed it on the first try.
[01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:56.250]  Took me a few tries. Let's see if he gets it.
[01:15:56.250 --> 01:16:03.930]  They give you like four different options in the dropdown. So you got to pick it.
[01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:08.930]  Still still facing you. It's doing something.
[01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:23.330]  And everybody in the chat can patiently wait while we and actually up in up in Illinois,
[01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:29.330]  if you want to flip your camera to it'll be easier.
[01:16:30.330 --> 01:16:38.330]  It'll be easier for you when you're showing stuff. If you flip your camera to the to the front facing versus the selfie camera.
[01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:48.330]  So just tap on the camera mic sprocket and there should be some options for video to pick a different camera as the source.
[01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:53.330]  Let's see. It's a race between the two of them to see which can figure who can.
[01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:58.330]  Here we go. We have a winner. Look at that. Oh, my God. They both got it.
[01:16:58.330 --> 01:17:04.600]  All right. We're good. Yeah. So we're going to start in Texas.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:11.600]  All right. Well, sweet. All right. Let me get out of this viewpoints.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:22.670]  I'm not. And can you turn your camera 90 degrees again? So it's like a TV.
[01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:28.670]  Can we get TV mode? There we go. Yeah. Look at that.
[01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:34.670]  This is broadcasting to live in 4K. All right. So.
[01:17:36.670 --> 01:17:44.670]  So, yes, guys, this is Texas. We're in Giddings, which is central Texas, about an hour east of Austin.
[01:17:44.670 --> 01:17:56.670]  And this is our little backyard farm. So we've got a shop here where we handle propagation and vegetative growth under LEDs from Fluence.
[01:17:56.670 --> 01:18:01.670]  I'll show you those. Hopefully I get a signal inside the shop. That's also where all the drying and curing goes down.
[01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:08.670]  But this is a flowering greenhouse. I don't have the light depth installed yet. Don't need it this fall.
[01:18:08.670 --> 01:18:25.670]  So we'll be putting that in this winter for next spring's run. But basically, as we sit right now, our cultivation strategy is running a perpetual harvest with three batches in the spring and three in the fall.
[01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:37.670]  And we're going to run two custom three and a half foot wide by 70 foot long grassroots beds per batch with 144 plants total in each batch.
[01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:47.670]  So 72 plants per bed. So I guess just to know my signal could maybe drop from the Wi-Fi when I'm in the shop.
[01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:54.670]  I'll start out in the greenhouse and then I'll kick off the Wi-Fi and maybe my cell will work in the greenhouse.
[01:18:54.670 --> 01:19:08.210]  So I'm sorry in the shop. So, yeah. Welcome to 4K Farm.
[01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:18.210]  This is a greenhouse. It's the Snow Arch series with rolled down six foot rolled down sidewalls.
[01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:28.450]  I don't have all my plants on the left.
[01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:34.450]  We harvested a bunch of plants last weekend and now we're running batch is our first batch.
[01:19:34.450 --> 01:19:43.450]  So the plants that we already harvested were our stock plants that we bought to get the genetic.
[01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:46.450]  And then these were our first batch of clones.
[01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:56.450]  So basically what we do is run the run the clones for about weeks on a prop rack.
[01:19:56.450 --> 01:20:00.450]  So, yeah, I'm a friend also on the bed rack.
[01:20:00.450 --> 01:20:07.450]  So it's about six weeks total time in the indoor space and they get transplanted out here.
[01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:12.450]  And we're flowering for six and a half to seven weeks with this variety.
[01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:17.450]  This cultivar has really impressed me.
[01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:23.450]  It is like that CBG completely. What was the name of that one again?
[01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:30.450]  Total THC compliant. Janet B.
[01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:39.830]  So this is the end of week three.
[01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:49.320]  That will be 28 day per day. So you can see the buds are just starting to.
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:57.680]  So we run like I said, these are the custom beds we had made.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:07.680]  We had a locally sourced organic oil. That's locally sourced.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:11.680]  Sorry, can you say that again?
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:13.680]  You had a locally sourced.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:19.680]  Quite a bit of perlite. So we have about 22%, 23% perlite.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:29.680]  All right, back to you. You ready to look at this?
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:34.680]  We're just going around the horn. You want to flip your camera and take two?
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:39.680]  Yeah, sure. OK, sorry if that first feed was just garbage.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.680]  We're all visualizing what you were saying.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:51.680]  Yeah, that's so killer. I got to look into that Janet B.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.680]  Because I've just been running cherry wine. The most boring.
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:58.680]  Well, I shouldn't say the most boring. It's been cool to grow.
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.680]  So this is all cherry wine.
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:05.680]  And flip your camera 90 degrees.
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:08.680]  Oh, yep, yep, yep. TV mode. Here we go.
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:12.680]  We live in an Instagram world, but we're on television now.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.680]  So yeah, so this is the one I've been running.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:21.680]  So the temp right now is 88 and the humidity is 85%.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:30.680]  So all this has been just total experimentation.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:36.680]  So this is all cherry wine and things have been doing great.
[01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:42.680]  I've been trying to use a lot of the methods that I've been hearing from.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:47.680]  I end up hearing methods from everybody that it's like, oh, my God, I'm trying so many fucking different things.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.680]  It's like, I just got to slow down.
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:52.680]  And oh, hey, we got some wheatgrass. That's pretty cool.
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:59.680]  So I planted some wheatgrass that I got at the hydro store.
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.680]  How's the feed, by the way? Is everything OK right now?
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:06.680]  It is. It is much better. All right. All right, cool.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:13.680]  So these right here.
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:16.680]  OK, this one right here. This one's cool.
[01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:21.680]  This one actually. Sorry. These four fabric pots right here.
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:27.680]  This one, that one and then those two are all.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:39.680]  I did the biomimicry biomimicry that Leighton Morrison talks about with the layers of, you know, the different horizons of soil and whatnot.
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.680]  And I'll tell you what, I am the king of over watering something.
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:50.680]  And these leaves have been doing nothing but just, you know, open up the tent and they're all just standing, you know, standing right up.
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:54.680]  And and yeah. So we got some some wheatgrass popping up today.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:58.680]  I don't know if you guys can see that, but starting to pop up.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:08.680]  I so so this tent is eventually going to get the four by eight raised bed.
[01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:15.680]  I just want to find out who I want to take the cuts off of or who is just going to get directly transplanted.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:27.680]  And then I just kind of wanted to show the guy how how how, you know, killer the grass roots fabric pots are going to be with the blue mat system.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:33.680]  Because all day, you know, I don't got to tell you guys, you know, it's killer.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:38.680]  You know, the the biggest thing that we that we mix up is, you know, just watering.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:44.680]  So so if we can nail it and get that, you know, biology kicking off right away and leave it alone, you know, the killer.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:50.680]  So so this is all the stock that I'm going through to see what is going to go into the bed.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:25:00.680]  And some clone some of the ones of some of the ones here didn't do too nice when I was cloning.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:08.680]  I tried a couple of different methods and, you know, some work better than the others.
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:17.680]  Other than that, a lot of it is a cocoa, cocoa, perlite and peat.
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:23.680]  Been using a lot of roots organic to begin with.
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:31.680]  A lot of a lot of organic dry amendment hydro store methodology, if you will.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:36.680]  I've kind of now progressed into. Well, I guess.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:42.680]  OK, I guess this is how I first started out. So I was on the Fox farm.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:47.680]  I was on the Fox farm bid. So I was testing. Well, I shouldn't say I was testing.
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:54.680]  Just putting seeds in a pot. So that was where this one originally started was in some Fox farm.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:26:02.680]  And I think I got hooked on what's dude's name. Shout out Mr. Canucks Grow on YouTube.
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:06.680]  He he was on he was on the dry amendments, fabric pots.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:10.680]  And that's how I started. And that's where this one started off.
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:15.680]  And then I found you could take clones. So I took the clone and kind of kept it hanging around.
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:22.680]  And so that's kind of where I got, you know, the the the soil tech to begin with.
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:26.680]  I never really liked the hydro scene. You know, I like having my hands in dirt.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:31.680]  I was, you know, raised outside with, you know, fruits and vegetables in the backyard all the time.
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:34.680]  So I was like, it just makes sense to put it, you know, right in soil.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.680]  So you can see it's a pretty standard soil mix.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:42.680]  This one probably is a little heavier on the cocoa with all these fibers going on right now.
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:48.680]  But I've been messing around with some rice hull as a mulch layer.
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:55.680]  Not a huge fan. It's kind of tough to tell when the real substrates dry or not.
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:00.680]  I think it'd be nice for outdoors. You got to keep, you know, wind and whatnot off.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:09.680]  But anyway, just quickly, Philippe is how many in the US, how many gallon pots are those?
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:12.680]  Just kind of the range of pots that you're growing in.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.680]  OK, so these ones are probably like a half gallon.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:20.680]  These ones are pretty small. They said one gallon on the shelves, but it was kind of tiny.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:22.680]  So these are probably like a little bit less than a gallon.
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:27.680]  These ones, I think, are maybe three to five gallon plastic.
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:31.680]  These fabric ones are all three gallon.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:37.680]  And then I got some. So these smaller ones are one gallon ones.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.680]  I was trying some autos in here, but that never worked out.
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:48.680]  Yeah, I was really on that rice hull for a minute, as you could tell.
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.680]  But the ones that did work out were these ones.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:58.680]  So these are, I think they were like Sensei Research seeds or something.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:03.680]  Had a really high CBD auto that he wanted me to try.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.680]  So those ones are in some one gallon.
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:11.680]  These ones are just like a peat moss perlite combo with some dry amendments.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:16.680]  And, you know, pretty stereotypical kind of fabric pot organic style.
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:19.680]  But yeah, these ones are all three gallon.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:23.680]  I think these are five. I want to say these are five gallon.
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:29.680]  I kind of got these on a whim right away and they've just been sitting around.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:33.680]  I've had them. I really don't like plastic, but I don't want to just throw them away because, you know,
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:36.680]  I have them, I'm going to use them.
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:42.680]  But all this is going to be a raised bed, hopefully, in the next couple of weeks here
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:46.680]  after we decide who's the winners.
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:49.680]  So that's what's going on with this.
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:55.680]  And then the other tents have just been kind of experimentals.
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:59.680]  So this one, if you can see a bit better.
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.680]  Is that a better quality video?
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:03.680]  Yes.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:04.680]  All right, cool.
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:08.680]  So yeah, this one, what we were talking about, this one caught some burn.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:18.680]  It was just, you know, I had the lights on way too close and caught some tip burn.
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:23.680]  But other than that, it's been thrown off this wild strawberry smell.
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:25.680]  Really cool.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:37.680]  But the thing that I'm sure 4K Farms, you can attest to is this whole, you know, 0.3 THC stuff going on.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:42.680]  And that's been the really tough part because we'll get something really killer smelling.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:45.680]  And then it's like, well, shit, you know, we just blew it by this much.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:49.680]  And it's like, well, all right, back to the drawing board.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.680]  But nonetheless, we're still we're still hunting.
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:52.680]  We're still trying to find it.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:53.680]  We're still trying to find it.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:55.680]  This one right here, I'll have to back up a little bit.
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:59.680]  But this one, so these are all auto flowers that I've been working through.
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:01.680]  This is all in fabric pots.
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:07.680]  This one, this is this is kind of like my, this is my really like high performance one right now.
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:15.680]  So this is two, I think 20 gallon fabric pots with a saran wrap layer in between.
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:23.680]  And this was totally way before I found that Tyler had the liner.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.680]  I was like, oh, dude, that's like perfect.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.680]  I'm out here saran wrap my shit.
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:29.680]  So it's smart.
[01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:30.680]  It's two, it's two fabric.
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:33.680]  Cause like I hate and you see it right here.
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:38.680]  This is like, this is dry soil and there's no life left in the soil right here.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.680]  And I was like, that just doesn't make sense to me.
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:44.680]  And that's why, you know, I have some of the few plastic pots going.
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:49.680]  Cause I'm like, all right, well, fuck, if I gotta keep my life going on the sides, I'll sacrifice buying plastic.
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:53.680]  But then I was like, all right, well, a little, a little, a little bit of compromise here.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:54.680]  So it's two fabric pots.
[01:30:54.680 --> 01:31:00.680]  And then I think it's kind of really a crazy mix in here right now.
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:09.680]  So it's the base is peat moss and cocoa, and then it's perlite and some like hydro pebbles that I had.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:16.680]  I wanted some really larger aggregate in there.
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:21.680]  And then I have a lot of malted barley and a lot of milled malted barley.
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:30.680]  As well as I think a little bit of some flaked oat mixed in there.
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:34.680]  That was kind of just a bit more of a top layer dress to really kick off that mycelium that.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:39.680]  And then I mulched it with the rice hull.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:43.680]  And then I didn't like how the rice hull would really dry out so fast.
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:50.680]  So I mixed that back in and then I switched to, you know, trying to attempt at a living, you know, mulch.
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.680]  So I got some radish going here.
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:56.680]  And then I got my, my avocado tack here.
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:32:02.680]  And I just tossed in a couple more batches of worms here.
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:12.680]  The initial round, I did some night crawlers and I think my pot's only 25, maybe 30 gallons here.
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:14.680]  So I think it was just way too small for night crawlers.
[01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:20.680]  So I got a smaller variety of red wigglers that a guy talked me into.
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:22.680]  So we'll see how those do.
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:27.680]  I have a mix in the avocado if anybody's out there digging the avocado tack.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:35.680]  It's just some avocado, some malted barley, and I think some prunes.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.680]  But we'll see. We'll see.
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:44.680]  But yeah, anyway, there's some really interesting smelling ones back here.
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:50.680]  I have to ask the guy what the thing is and I'll post on Instagram.
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:54.680]  But it's smelling good.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:57.680]  This one right here has been just flying above everybody else.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:03.680]  It's a good probably, I don't know, almost probably a foot above the rest of canopy.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:04.680]  It's a big one.
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:08.680]  So, you know, it's always fun seeing all the different varieties, even with, you know,
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:14.680]  what might be considered a more tame genetic of just cherry wine, CBD.
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.680]  But we're still we're still trying to do it.
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:18.680]  We're still trying to do the damn thing.
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:20.680]  But this is the one where I got the combo light.
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:27.680]  So this is I got. So it's that that one's the CMH on just a hood.
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:36.680]  And then these are the HLG. I think there's 60 watt and there's there's I forgot exactly how many diodes,
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:46.680]  but I think it's like a 600 range far red and then I think a farther 700 range deep red or however it works, vice versa.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:52.680]  I got those on combo right now and the plants are doing great in here.
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:34:03.680]  These ones, this one is another genetic that we're working on here that is supposed to put out a really great resin quality.
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:12.680]  I don't remember the name off the top of my head, but the families on this one have just been just ginormous.
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:17.680]  Just beefy plant compared to the rest of them. And and these are and these are another two.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:26.680]  So yesterday I found a little spot of PM on this front fan leaf.
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:32.680]  And so I hit I hit it with mammoth.
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:37.680]  Mammoth makes a I think insecticide and pesticide spray.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:41.680]  I forgot exactly what it was called. The dude at the hydro store threw it to me and I was kind of like, oh, shit.
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:45.680]  I got a little spot of PM. What do I got here?
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.680]  And you need to hit it with copper sulfate. OK, OK.
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:53.680]  Yeah. I mean, that might be in this mammoth product. I'm not sure.
[01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:58.680]  I didn't exactly read. I was kind of just in panic mode at the end of the night going over everything with the headlamp.
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:06.680]  And I was like, oh, fuck. So. So, yeah, I don't know if you can kind of still see some residue on there, but the PM is gone.
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:14.680]  It was right in the middle. So I tossed the heater up, up, up, up, up top to start getting some heat down.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:20.680]  And I turned the HVAC system off, cranked the heat to I think it was like 98,
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:32.680]  sprayed the spray, the solution on a few minutes prior and cut the lights and cooked it for about 25, 30 minutes at like upper 90s.
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:37.680]  And this morning, as far as I can tell, you know, I don't see see much.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:42.680]  I haven't really had a chance to go through leaf by leaf, but as far as I can tell, I cooked most of it off.
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:47.680]  So shout out mammoth and maybe shout out the heater. I'm not sure which.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:56.680]  But yeah, I'm not seeing it on much of the leaf surface on either of those, because these two both had a little spot on the last night.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:01.680]  I wasn't seeing on the preliminary checks. But, you know. So, yeah, we're working on that.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:07.680]  I know it's I know it's what's going on down here is really the main issue.
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:13.680]  Again, it's my watering. I know I have dry spots and whatnot. So.
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:17.680]  But yeah, we're trying. We're learning. You guys have been a huge help.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:22.680]  You know, it's been killer. I guess. OK, so I guess I'll run through the lights real quick.
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:32.680]  So, yeah, those are the two HLG's with I think it's a three hundred and fifteen watt ceramic hood.
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:41.680]  This one, I think it's a Lux Lux thousand watt on just some just regular old hood that dude had laying around.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:46.680]  These two are spider farmers. I think they're the SF four thousands.
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:56.680]  I originally had that one of those HLG far red lights in the middle, but it just really wasn't.
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:37:00.680]  I feel like it wasn't really doing much.
[01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:06.680]  So this one has been really, really killer. So I don't know if you can see at the very top of the four by eight.
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:12.680]  I have the 650 Diablo clicked on literally just just until it turns on.
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:21.680]  And these things like I mean, they're they're more green and squat and putting up more side branches than any other light that I have in here.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:26.680]  And this thing has been crushing it like no it's so wild. Shout out HLG.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:34.160]  They're killer. I think I saw in the comments, I just want to say one of the biggest,
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:43.160]  crappiest myths ever is the benefits of air pruning. And that's why he's wrapping the fabric pots of saran wrap is to create a natural dry out environment.
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:52.160]  Like native soil dries out from the top only normal fabric pots without that line are going to dry out from all different angles and sides,
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.160]  which is an unnatural drying pattern for living soil for synthetic growing.
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:01.160]  A normal fabric pot works great because you have a faster wet dry cycle for more feedings.
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:05.160]  So I just want to address that real quick. Yeah, totally, man.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:10.160]  You know, the the whole the whole idea of the wet dry out cycle.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:19.160]  You know, I never really got that. I mean, I think if you want high quality roots, they they need moist, a certain amount of moisture at all times.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:25.160]  They don't really ever need to be dried out. I mean, if you want to go into stressing techniques, that's a whole other thing.
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:29.160]  But just as general agriculture goes, you need moisture at your roots.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:37.160]  So that's why, you know, I'm trying to, you know, do things with the mulch layers and ideas of keeping the sidewalls moist.
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:44.160]  But at the end of the day, I'm just running into imbalance on either end of the scale when I'm trying to, you know, when I'm trying to drive.
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:52.160]  So I need to let the soil drive and let the plant drive. And hopefully with that, with this, with this bad boy right here, with this guy.
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:56.160]  And hopefully that blue mat system is coming in, I think, like next week.
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:01.160]  I got that four by eight. I forgot how many carats are in that system. But yeah, I'm about to throw down.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:04.160]  It's going to be it's going to be some madness up in here.
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:10.160]  And then I also wanted to say copper sulfate. That's where I got that from was normal agriculture.
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:22.160]  I visited a peach farmer that turned to be a very successful cannabis farmer, and he had rid himself of PM and mold by foliar spraying copper sulfate during veg.
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:30.160]  Along with sap testing, you could take leaf samples, set it into a laboratory, new age, new age laboratory in Michigan.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:34.160]  And they could tell you where your copper sulfate level is, excuse me, copper level is.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:41.160]  And you could use copper sulfate to bring those levels up and prevent mold or in the red mold entirely of your garden.
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:56.160]  Yeah, man. And you know that that's that's a great, great point to bring up, because, you know, especially especially as a, you know, as a home hobby gardener, if you will, you know, stepping up to the next level.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:09.160]  If I want to get a nice soil sample, I want to get a reliable analysis on something, you know, we're good resources for like the home gardener, you know, the individual to go to, you know.
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:15.160]  Yeah, reach out to new age laboratories on Instagram or new age laboratories.
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:17.160]  They're in Michigan.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.160]  But it's a great resource.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.160]  You have to have 90 grams of leaf.
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:26.160]  You have to have 90 grams of old leaf and 90 grams of new leaf.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:31.160]  They send that into the laboratory and they compare the old leaf to the new leaf to look for deficiencies.
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:39.160]  I definitely would love to do an event with Jenny Garland, the scientific chief operator for new age laboratories.
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:44.160]  They take in the most amount of hemp and cannabis samples in the United States.
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:48.160]  So definitely everybody check out new age laboratories on Instagram.
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:49.160]  Go blow it up.
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.160]  Go ask Jenny a whole bunch of questions.
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:57.160]  She's very knowledgeable about sap testing, copper sulfate and all the different foliar sprays to boost those levels.
[01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:04.160]  All right. Well, we have 4K farms has patiently been waiting.
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:07.160]  So let's let's jump back down to Texas.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:08.160]  What do you got for us?
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:15.160]  So actually, where you cut out, you were about to talk about kind of how you like this stuff you source to initially put in the bed.
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:16.160]  So can you run through that again?
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.160]  Yeah, guys, I'm sorry.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:22.330]  I got a full.
[01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:24.330]  Looks like.
[01:41:28.330 --> 01:41:30.330]  Nowhere is just start from the top again.
[01:41:30.330 --> 01:41:33.330]  You're starting to talk about sourcing stuff locally.
[01:41:33.330 --> 01:41:34.330]  You're sourced organic soil.
[01:41:38.670 --> 01:41:42.670]  The unit and a lot of rice holes and local.
[01:41:48.030 --> 01:41:51.030]  Yeah, well, you know, there's a there's a soil.
[01:41:53.030 --> 01:42:01.030]  And amendment company that's based in Central Tech, 36 yards of their soil and then amended.
[01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:03.030]  With her.
[01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:05.030]  You're you're you're you're hot.
[01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:06.030]  And let me.
[01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:09.030]  Can you hear me?
[01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:13.030]  Can you hear me?
[01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:16.030]  You're kind of.
[01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:24.130]  OK, can you go back to where you get good signal and let it go back?
[01:42:24.130 --> 01:42:26.130]  Yeah. Go back to where you get good signal.
[01:42:27.130 --> 01:42:30.130]  All right, let's let's hear you talk now.
[01:42:32.130 --> 01:42:33.130]  Can you hear me?
[01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:34.130]  Yeah, I can.
[01:42:34.130 --> 01:42:35.130]  Yeah.
[01:42:35.130 --> 01:42:36.130]  Perfect.
[01:42:36.130 --> 01:42:37.130]  Okay.
[01:42:37.130 --> 01:42:38.130]  So.
[01:42:38.130 --> 01:42:39.130]  Try to find.
[01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:41.130]  Yep.
[01:42:42.130 --> 01:42:43.130]  There we go.
[01:42:44.130 --> 01:42:45.130]  All right.
[01:42:45.130 --> 01:42:46.130]  Let's let's hear you talk now.
[01:42:46.130 --> 01:42:48.470]  All right.
[01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:49.470]  All right.
[01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:50.470]  All right.
[01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:51.470]  Can you hear me?
[01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:52.470]  Yeah, I can.
[01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:53.470]  Yeah.
[01:42:53.470 --> 01:42:54.470]  Perfect.
[01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:55.470]  OK.
[01:42:55.470 --> 01:42:56.470]  So, yeah.
[01:42:56.470 --> 01:43:03.350]  Okay, so yeah, I'd rather people hear it so we can sacrifice the visuals. Yes, so I'm a little different
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.320]  Go ahead
[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:12.220]  What's that
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:17.360]  Yep, go for okay, so so so initially building the soil what you do and where do you source?
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:24.040]  Yeah, source local locally sourced organic soil just a company here geo growers. They focus on working
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:31.300]  them
[01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:34.220]  All right, can you all hear me yep
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.720]  We can
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:43.440]  Can you all all right? I don't know if I'll just talk for a minute
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:50.450]  Perfect oh
[01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:59.290]  Yeah, just source some some soil locally that was already amended by you know an organic business here in Central, Texas
[01:44:02.170 --> 01:44:04.170]  They have several different
[01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:12.690]  Choices of soil for different crops or uses, but worked with the owner of this business geo growers
[01:44:14.690 --> 01:44:20.890]  George and we kind of worked on one of his recipes and kind of catered it more towards cannabis and
[01:44:21.450 --> 01:44:25.090]  specifically cannabis flowering so this is a these are the
[01:44:27.610 --> 01:44:33.610]  Beds are only used for flowering and bones and a peat plug tray, and then they get transplanted into a one-gallon
[01:44:34.170 --> 01:44:36.170]  plastic
[01:44:38.410 --> 01:44:44.450]  Nursery container that's got Fox farm salamander oil that I use it's a really great product
[01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:47.730]  that's you know consistent from from Fox farm and
[01:44:50.770 --> 01:44:51.950]  I'm a little different
[01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:56.730]  I would say my style than a lot of the hardware organic guys, and I don't mean any hate by that
[01:44:56.730 --> 01:44:58.730]  I love all forms of cultivation
[01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:01.210]  but
[01:45:01.210 --> 01:45:02.610]  my style
[01:45:02.610 --> 01:45:09.450]  Was a little bit more of a hybrid approach so my background is in commercial ag and I managed a big
[01:45:09.610 --> 01:45:13.130]  Medical grow here in Texas most people don't realize we actually have a medical program
[01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:17.890]  Graham it's very limited, but I was a part of that and
[01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:21.930]  So what I do is I use a organic media
[01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:24.850]  And then I utilize organic
[01:45:26.610 --> 01:45:28.890]  Nutrients liquid liquid blends a lot of kelp
[01:45:30.010 --> 01:45:31.890]  fulvic acid
[01:45:31.890 --> 01:45:36.970]  Taquano worm castings all the goodies, but I also I'm not afraid to use salt so that's that's
[01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:43.610]  Right probably a lot different than a lot of the been talking already with the strictly organic approach
[01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:48.050]  I have just found in a commercial setting that the salt
[01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:54.930]  Use is a lot more tunable and so we can do better crop steering and
[01:45:55.970 --> 01:46:01.010]  Certain development phases we can push growth more specifically with plant available nutrients
[01:46:01.970 --> 01:46:05.570]  And then we also have the dual benefit of the organics
[01:46:06.090 --> 01:46:07.090]  soil
[01:46:07.090 --> 01:46:14.370]  So that we're working with the microbiology and and the plant health aspects from that angle that's kind of my style so
[01:46:15.570 --> 01:46:21.490]  Yeah, really good organic blended soil. That's been amended with perlite for aeration and
[01:46:22.090 --> 01:46:26.650]  It's you know pretty sandy. It's got a lot of decomposed granite gravel in it
[01:46:28.410 --> 01:46:31.210]  Which is real fine gravel a lot of rice holes
[01:46:32.130 --> 01:46:37.970]  and then it's just a combination of hand watering with liquid organics and then
[01:46:40.530 --> 01:46:44.810]  Feeding through drip with salt or tilled fertigation I
[01:46:46.410 --> 01:46:50.570]  You know run these beds with a lower salt
[01:46:52.450 --> 01:46:55.730]  See then I would a straight cocoa or
[01:46:56.490 --> 01:46:58.490]  soilless mix
[01:46:58.610 --> 01:47:00.890]  So it's it's not the exact same
[01:47:02.090 --> 01:47:03.810]  salt
[01:47:03.810 --> 01:47:09.250]  Bridge system is a lot of commercial growers are using in containers and in grow facilities, so it's kind of a
[01:47:10.050 --> 01:47:14.810]  more organic heavy system, but you know we're still utilizing those salts
[01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:17.810]  to push that flowering growth especially
[01:47:18.690 --> 01:47:20.690]  bulking and and
[01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:22.810]  You know extra calcium and magnesium
[01:47:24.570 --> 01:47:30.090]  Can you talk about us like what specific salts are using hopefully I'll can
[01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:39.660]  Go ahead, Illinois, I was I was just about I was just about to ask the exact question what salts
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:42.820]  yeah, so
[01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:44.860]  they basically these are
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:51.280]  Yeah, so very common ag use
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:58.360]  Horticulture you know just add some salt mags they calcium nitrate and then I use a base blend
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:02.320]  Peters hydroponic special Peters profession
[01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:04.640]  No, it's
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:10.240]  also Scott's brand, but it's at 511 26 with micros and
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:13.440]  Then we add in
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.720]  MKP monopotassium phosphate
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:19.840]  During the flowering phase
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:26.840]  Do you notice any issues with the salts and running into high THC numbers?
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:31.160]  Like overall THC
[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:35.580]  Not at all
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:38.100]  Not at all and you know
[01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:40.380]  I
[01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:43.260]  Give credit to this genetic. You know variety
[01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:47.460]  CBG variety get tested at point one total THC
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:50.420]  Wow yeah, do you uh?
[01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:57.100]  Do you harvest yeah, I know you earlier you said you harvest around week six week seven
[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:06.860]  Maybe say the question again. Yes. Oh, yeah, I didn't mean to cut him off. I thought it was lagging um
[01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:12.740]  Earlier he was saying he harvests around week six week seven on their CBG variety, right?
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:26.680]  Yeah, so I initially thought it'd be a seven week variety, and then I saw it's you know maturity come quicker
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:29.920]  Than I expected and I've talked with the breeder
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:34.840]  This is the first this is the first batch that you know first run of this this cultivar for me
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.520]  So I was really leaning on the supplier and then you know other
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:41.040]  Growers
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:43.840]  Experiences and this is one of the furthest southern
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:48.320]  applications so far it's a genetic that they've worked heavily in South Carolina and
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:51.120]  Georgia some other areas that
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:56.000]  In the southeast, but this is about as far as it's gone south
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:02.320]  I know we weren't sure but um they typically they say this variety usually matures around six and a half to seven and a half
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.320]  week
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:06.600]  So does that
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:11.200]  Six and a half weeks and then I'm probably gonna harvest the second one either at the same
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:14.240]  Or at six weeks or seven weeks. It's still undecided and
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:17.920]  I'm not concerned at all about
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:25.800]  The compliance so what I'm really looking at I might push it to seven if my you know cured flower
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:28.200]  Potency
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:34.560]  Comes back under the target, you know CBD to a lot of people I think are claiming way too much on CBD
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:38.280]  Percentages that just I don't believe personally
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:47.600]  I think you claim the total cannabinoids when you're talking and that's you know, not taking into consideration the acidic conversion and
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:50.560]  You know, we got to look at CBD a C
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:52.360]  B
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:57.240]  G a in the 87.7 percent of that would be duck deep box
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:03.040]  So for total THC or our total cannabinoid, right, but we're looking at 13% is what we're trying
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.800]  And a hit on the CBG from a total CBG standpoint
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:16.040]  And I can tell you I mean terpenes and you know, I again I use all
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:22.120]  I hope that you know, you know, you guys can appreciate the
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.680]  The system because it works
[01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:29.600]  Very very well the plant health is
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:37.320]  Better than I've ever seen under any other type of program as far as the development and the growth, you know boost that
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:39.320]  but no doubt the org
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:42.640]  Organics is where I get full to that plant
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:47.820]  Yeah, the flavor and the terpene profile expressing itself as strongly as it does
[01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:51.080]  It it's a real
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:55.180]  Really small flower it's premium flower, but it's really smooth
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  smoke so
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:01.040]  It's Taylor right from 4k farms. Um
[01:52:02.720 --> 01:52:08.360]  Are you growing CBD for your CBG variety for flower for a smokable flower?
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:23.400]  Yeah, all right nice
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:27.800]  So Texas is one of those states that has tried to help
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:32.800]  Yeah, Texas is one of those states. This has tried to outlaw smokeable main the menu
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:39.840]  Factoring of smokeable flower, which is really goofy so shops can sell smokeable flower
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:42.760]  But it has to be like pre-rolls made out of state
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:47.880]  It's it's really good in court right now. It's gonna be
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:55.440]  Revisited wary, so it's kind of a gray area at the moment, but people are selling flower people are selling pre-rolls
[01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:58.080]  and so we have my
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:03.240]  my goal is premium flower to keep it in the state and support all the local stores and
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:05.800]  you know sell it at the
[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:11.660]  Antique shows and the farmers markets and stuff and just keep it just a premium locally grown flower
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:15.160]  But if if that happens and I'm definitely shipping out of state
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:18.600]  There's this is the business model it's premium flower
[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:22.680]  Okay, nice
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:25.160]  That's sick
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:29.760]  What made you go with the raised beds in your greenhouse, yeah, I mean
[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:36.500]  Just you know sustainability and and easy
[01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:40.660]  Like part of my automation is the drip irrigation. That's on a
[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:43.380]  On a
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:47.700]  Wi-Fi connected irrigation controller, so I've got an app to manage it
[01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:52.500]  I I do some travel from time to time and I have to lean on other family to take care of the farm
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:54.500]  And you know, it's pretty well
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:02.880]  Automated so just potting up cuttings and then
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.520]  Chance planning but it's pretty well automated
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:13.120]  So just quickly Sam I mute you when you're not talking because we can hear the fan in the background
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:15.520]  So just when you want to talk and mute yourself. Oh
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:19.760]  My bad gee I did not even realize okay
[01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:26.840]  Yeah, that's why I think you were like why the hell does he keep muting me so yeah
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:31.120]  Hey Peter, I don't know
[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:36.760]  Be happy to show the room one more time before I dip out
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:41.200]  Unless you're wrapping it up in a bit. Go more. These other guys want to show more of their stuff
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:49.020]  I want to give them the time to now. Let's go check it out. We can always do more later. So on another day
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:52.320]  For sure. I'll pop back in
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:01.200]  Okay, see you Taylor nice meeting you bro, all right guys, thank you
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:04.200]  Yeah
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:12.320]  All right, so yeah just for anyone that didn't I didn't see it in the beginning this is a one of our flower rooms
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:17.120]  So we got 20 lights in here right now
[01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:25.390]  And
[01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:26.390]  Yeah
[01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:30.590]  Although I'll show you guys some good shots of it and then I'll talk about it in the hallway
[01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:35.110]  Can you guys hear me? Okay in here. I got headphones on. Yeah, you sound good
[01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:38.470]  Okay, nice
[01:55:39.790 --> 01:55:47.470]  Just quickly do you sometimes walk outside and like go to like pick up a Subway sandwich with all that stuff on and forget to
[01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:49.030]  Take it off. Ah
[01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:55.950]  No, but sometimes I'm wearing my mask that I've been like kids and bugs and my mask will reek like mimosa or something or some
[01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:57.870]  strong clementine
[01:55:57.870 --> 01:55:59.870]  But no, I take all this shit off
[01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:04.790]  But yeah, so we're growing up
[01:56:05.310 --> 01:56:10.710]  We've got three different cultivars in here we have two phenos of cookies and cream and
[01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:13.790]  our phenol of mimosa and
[01:56:14.150 --> 01:56:17.890]  Then in this one bed, we're phenol hunting some northern lights and green crack
[01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:23.470]  And so our two cookies phenos
[01:56:23.470 --> 01:56:30.390]  We've we've narrowed it down to one that we're gonna run with but we're farming one row this one bed that we're growing right here
[01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:32.870]  this one
[01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:37.190]  Right over here that bed. We're probably gonna have to wholesale because it's not our
[01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:39.510]  It's not our best
[01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:41.910]  Pheno and what we're moving in all of our shops
[01:56:42.630 --> 01:56:48.750]  That we're in right now. So we're mainly going to be running with our higher THC testing higher total cannabinoids
[01:56:48.750 --> 01:56:53.150]  And the cookies, you know that we're going to be running with is way more cookie dominant
[01:56:54.750 --> 01:56:56.750]  These are fans
[01:56:56.870 --> 01:57:02.190]  Other guy was asking we've got two max fans right here in the in the far side
[01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:04.910]  And then there's two on this side in the front
[01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:09.310]  One right here and then one up there on the other side
[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:14.760]  So this room has max fans in it
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:18.000]  And
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.720]  The other room has the wall fans. I see a question about
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:28.180]  Clementine we're not actually growing Clementine mimosa is a cross between purple punch b2 and clementine
[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:34.940]  So that's but but our mimosa is it has the structure of the punch but it's got the nose of the clementine
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:38.540]  What's the original soil mix
[01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:41.220]  the soil in this
[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:46.100]  Yeah, like what's running guys had the the original light like when you first
[01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:51.020]  Filled the beds up. Yeah, we ran the build a soil 3.0 recipe
[01:57:51.860 --> 01:57:56.180]  from build a soil and so it's a 3.0 organic mix and
[01:57:56.540 --> 01:58:04.180]  We uh, we ordered I think probably like 40 yards we still have maybe like like 5 or 10 yards left
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:10.660]  But yeah, so the build of soil 3.0 is our base and then we add in worms and
[01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:19.420]  Then we're just we're continually trying to feed the soil make it better over time build a really good mulch layer
[01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:22.780]  And
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:26.980]  Yeah, and those are rolling benches next-gen rolling benches with
[01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:31.500]  One of the first cultivators United States to run the liners
[01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:34.740]  So there's not no PVC pipe. No
[01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:37.620]  fittings or
[01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:39.940]  Good video here, but I
[01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:45.380]  Actually had to construct this whole little bracket system
[01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:50.180]  I had to make this to satisfy our fire department
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:57.580]  Repairman's they wanted the tables if we like stop moving them. They want them to be able to lock automatically
[01:58:58.300 --> 01:59:00.300]  so this basically all a
[01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:02.580]  shift over
[01:59:02.580 --> 01:59:04.380]  like so
[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:07.680]  Or we'll move it this way depending on wherever we got to go
[01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:16.680]  How many cycles are you in on on these beds now
[01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:23.920]  This room is a second cycle room. So we've already ran one time the room next door. We're coming on our fourth cycle
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:29.800]  So we'll be replanting. So we've already harvested three cycles in it and we'll be replanting in a few days
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.280]  Have you noticed have you noticed like different expressions?
[01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:39.640]  With the cultivars with the different ages of the beds or has it been pretty, you know, yeah, I keep it steady. Oh
[01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:44.840]  We're trying to keep it as steady as we can what we did notice last round
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:50.960]  we ran mimosa in a first cycle room, so fresh soil and we ran mimosa in a second cycle room and
[01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:58.600]  The second cycle started so we noticed that they started to like our mimosa gets straight purple at the end of flower
[01:59:58.600 --> 02:00:05.000]  And so it started we noticed that it started to bring out colors a little more early, but it was still really healthy. And so
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:11.120]  We noticed the purple started coming out a little bit more in the buds not I see on the stem
[02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:17.000]  But in the buds and the leaves a little bit earlier in the second cycle room and on the third cycle
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.980]  We've noticed that we just need to amend a little bit more with our peas
[02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:22.940]  Between cycles
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:27.360]  Have you guys been running that mimosa the entire time with these beds?
[02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:30.460]  Not the wool
[02:00:32.020 --> 02:00:34.020]  Yeah, we've done now three
[02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:38.460]  When we've done to two harvests of this pheno
[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:42.860]  and so we're on our third one right now, so
[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:47.460]  Originally, we started you know hunting a bunch of different strains and then we write it down
[02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:53.820]  And then it just took a lot of time to get enough moms to have enough cuts to take hundreds of cuts of one strain
[02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:56.140]  Yeah, that's so killer. I
[02:00:56.420 --> 02:01:03.300]  Love to see the the strains kind of you know mate with their living soils, you know as the as time goes on
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:05.920]  That's really cool to see you know settle in
[02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:14.040]  100% and that's kind of what we're we're trying to test right now is like should we be running the same strain and the same
[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:17.720]  Cultivar round after round in the same room or should we be rotating?
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:22.580]  Cultivars potentially that one is gonna uptake more than another and it'll balance it out
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:25.400]  But that's what we're kind of trying to figure out right now
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:29.920]  You know not you know not to highlight any of the pitfalls
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:35.800]  But if you guys ran into any issues over these past past operations that you're like, oh
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:39.800]  We got to fix this or we miss something here
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:46.000]  Nothing like crazy our last round of a mosaic we looked a little bit nitrogen deficient so we were a little low on our yield
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:55.120]  I mean the biggest thing would just with this much soil indoors is just controlling fungus mats and any other pests really
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:57.640]  Yeah
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:01.960]  We've done the nice thing about a room of this size is that when you're running HBS lights
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:03.760]  That's with a thousand waters
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:12.000]  Thousand waters there is so much intense light that bugs and flies really don't like to be under it during the light cycle
[02:02:12.400 --> 02:02:15.400]  So we put fly traps up high above the lights
[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:19.880]  I don't know if you guys can see but there's a bunch they're hanging from the ceiling little yellow fly traps
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:22.720]  kind of hard to see but
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:30.400]  What we notice is any flies that are around during the day they will stay above the lights and hang out above the lights
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:33.440]  and
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:38.080]  Usually we'll try to catch them on the sticky fly traps. I see a comment here blue mats. We're not using blue mats
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:41.120]  We're using a garden grid for our watering
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:47.520]  Was there was there any consideration of the use of blue mats
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:51.840]  Uh, we kind of looked into it one thing on
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:57.040]  irrigating individual 4x4 beds is it's just it gets kind of like
[02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:03.740]  cumbersome when there's so many different lines running that are not connected or if they are there it when you're putting them stakes in the
[02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:05.740]  Soil to hold everything
[02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:09.260]  Because we're not a long 24-foot bed
[02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:15.500]  it was easier for us to put a grid in and it also helps with our space to plant because each grid has
[02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:22.260]  Maybe you guys can see down here. But each grid there's 16 grid. They're all squares. And so the
[02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:26.580]  The grids actually help size are where we're gonna plant
[02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:32.980]  Are you feeding the lines are you eating are you feeding externally?
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:40.020]  We only water we only put our water through the lines currently and so when we brew teas we're gonna hand water those through a
[02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:42.620]  Submersible pump cool
[02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:46.180]  That's a good way of going
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.960]  It's it's dude it's looking so good
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:53.520]  I love seeing that
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:58.560]  You know the facility can be running a couple cycles in without any serious hiccups
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:02.480]  That means that you guys are you know, you're on it. You're on your game, you know
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:10.040]  Yeah, we're trying to be you know there we deal with pests like anyone else but we're not we're not super concerned on
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:14.600]  Low amounts of pests if you know, we're seeing them on the fly traps if we're not seeing
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:17.960]  Plant damage or we're not really seeing any other issues
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:23.280]  Girl I mean living soil it's gonna there are gonna be pests here in there
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:27.400]  And so that is just part of growing and farming organically
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:35.200]  And so we're gonna be testing out just planting some other companion plants some more basil and marigolds and things like that
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:44.760]  Nice, I would I would highly highly recommend listening to a couple episodes of the kiss organic podcast with the bug lady
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:46.200]  I think was the episode
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:53.280]  She talks about some killer beneficial bugs in the garden if you you know want to really have that super beefy IPM system
[02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:58.720]  For sure shout out that podcast as well a lot a lot of really good knowledge there
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:06.640]  No, I love seeing everybody walking around super clean masked up hair nuts and everything. That's great. That's super clean medicine
[02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:08.640]  That's what we love to see man
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:11.640]  Appreciate it. Yeah, that's that's our standard all the time. So
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:18.120]  Yeah, you know we're trying our best here and we're continually learning
[02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:23.320]  Adapting, you know if something if there's an issue, you know, we're we try to be on it to fix it
[02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:31.880]  And you know, we definitely we do not claim to know it all we're constantly learning we're adapting we get it wrong too, you know
[02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:34.080]  and
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.400]  so
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:41.360]  This is just one way to form and we're we're trying to bring it to light and bring sustainability and regenerative agriculture
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:43.280]  into a more
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:48.080]  Upfront side of cannabis growing and to actually get it known get it out there and
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:54.720]  There's a few brands in California that are cultivating in living soil. Maybe not all of their stuff is in it, but
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:06:00.880]  We haven't seen a lot of other brands that actually are showing their process showing the soil showing the worms
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:07.280]  It just says it's cultivated in living soil. And so you kind of got to take it on a whim that they're actually doing it
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:12.800]  That's why I want to thank Jake for coming on here and showing what he's doing because there's a lot of successful
[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:16.800]  facilities out there and they're so successful that they're not going to show what they're doing because
[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:19.680]  they're gonna hold that tight to their vest and they're gonna try to
[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:24.840]  Hold their brand and hold what they do and I respect that but then you know
[02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:28.720]  I'm kind of a person who just gives it all out to the community myself personally
[02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:31.780]  So, you know, I I don't you know subscribe to that
[02:06:31.780 --> 02:06:36.960]  but I respect that you know as long as you're you're putting out a good quality brand and doing a good thing and
[02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:39.400]  I'm really happy with what we're doing with
[02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:42.040]  710 labs in the Bay Area
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:47.400]  we've got some really cool stuff going on with them and a few other cool facilities that are coming online with
[02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:51.120]  Getting ready to come out publicly about what they're doing
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:56.720]  I think we need to get 710 labs on for morning gardens or yep
[02:06:56.720 --> 02:07:03.000]  They're getting dialed in and figured out where they want to go and I'll hit up my boy Richie and and see when he's ready
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.920]  To do that. I've been talking with him and we're actually doing the same next-gen
[02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:14.240]  Liner project with them that we did with no till Kings to because the liners are becoming very popular
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:18.560]  Because they want rolling benches. They want to squeeze everything in and they're
[02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:26.600]  you know, obviously couldn't taking the benefits of jungle boys converting it into organics and just
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:30.280]  come all these compounding factors are really starting to
[02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:36.400]  Be prevalent for them and the test results and the trial runs
[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:40.800]  I think for a lot of different facilities have now came out to proven positivity
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:44.260]  So we're gonna see a lot of cool stuff going on
[02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:48.960]  I've kind of got a bow out here. I've got a couple of projects that need my attention
[02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:55.240]  So I'm gonna have to have to leave here to help out some grassroots customers. Yeah. No, this is a good time to end
[02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:57.240]  I just remember that we have a
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:02.640]  Disc a grassroots discount code, so I'm gonna post that in the chat. What is it? It's FCP 5
[02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:09.440]  FCP 5. All right. Yeah, I'll be done in a sec. So, all right. Well everyone
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:16.920]  We appreciate that. First of all, thanks everyone who gave us a tour and Tyler all the people watching right now
[02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:20.000]  We're gonna heckle you mercilessly until you bring 710 on
[02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:25.960]  So you guys are gonna be my memory to remember to kick Tyler in the butt to make that happen
[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:31.120]  I saw some emails coming in of people who wanted to show their stuff. I appreciate it
[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:36.420]  I but I got to get I got to prepare for our Kang in water conversation at one o'clock
[02:08:36.420 --> 02:08:42.440]  But also don't be insulted if I don't get back to you right away or if I get back to you and then flake out
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:48.960]  I have like I'm like a chicken with my head cut off right now until I got some some help besides myself
[02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:52.760]  Doing the best I can but
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:58.360]  So we have Kang in at 1 p.m. And for you guys I appreciate it and
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:04.760]  We'll be back soon with the morning gardens for it could even be tomorrow morning or the next morning. Who knows?
[02:09:06.160 --> 02:09:10.360]  Certainly not me. All right. Thank you so much guys for coming on. I really appreciate you guys
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.240]  Yeah, yeah glad to be here
[02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:18.920]  All right. Thanks guys killer and with that I'll kill the live stream
