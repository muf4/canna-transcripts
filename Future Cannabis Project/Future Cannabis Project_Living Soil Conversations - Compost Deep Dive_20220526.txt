[00:00.000 --> 00:04.640]  All right, Alexa, you ready for round two?
[00:04.640 --> 00:08.320]  Yes, so happy to be back.
[00:08.320 --> 00:09.320]  Thank you for having me.
[00:09.320 --> 00:12.880]  So glad we can have this conversation today.
[00:12.880 --> 00:15.880]  All right, take it away, Brian.
[00:15.880 --> 00:16.880]  Absolutely.
[00:16.880 --> 00:18.200]  Good morning to you, Living Soil Nerds.
[00:18.200 --> 00:22.760]  In my opinion, this is going to be one for more of the advanced farmers today.
[00:22.760 --> 00:25.560]  We're going to talk about some deeper topics.
[00:25.560 --> 00:29.960]  The reason why we have another back-to-back is because of Alexa just kind of blowing away
[00:29.960 --> 00:34.560]  the community with what she knows.
[00:34.560 --> 00:39.160]  I would say almost every single person I always get a positive feedback from because three
[00:39.160 --> 00:44.440]  hours people doing this on their own time, it's pretty hard to see any negativity in
[00:44.440 --> 00:45.440]  that.
[00:45.440 --> 00:49.760]  On the flip side of that, Alexa, people are just blown away with your knowledge and what
[00:49.760 --> 00:51.720]  you're willing to share.
[00:51.720 --> 00:53.640]  We even talked about some intermittent fasting.
[00:53.640 --> 00:58.840]  I wanted to share just a message that I got that I think you'll appreciate, Alexa, as
[00:58.840 --> 00:59.840]  well.
[00:59.840 --> 01:01.200]  It says, hi, Brian.
[01:01.200 --> 01:05.760]  I wanted to say thank you for all of the info you put out, not just cannabis, but for the
[01:05.760 --> 01:07.600]  intermittent fasting too.
[01:07.600 --> 01:12.440]  I am a disabled vet and I spent 10 years stuck on the couch, sometimes only going outside
[01:12.440 --> 01:14.400]  once a month to check the mail.
[01:14.400 --> 01:19.480]  I watched your journey and when you did your first 72-hour fast on the podcast, I said
[01:19.480 --> 01:21.240]  I need to really look into this.
[01:21.760 --> 01:26.200]  I'm proud to say I just completed my first six-day, five-and-a-half-hour fast and I drank
[01:26.200 --> 01:28.640]  some turkey bone broth and some salt.
[01:28.640 --> 01:34.440]  I'm still struggling with my injuries, but I'm down from a size 44 waist to a 36.
[01:34.440 --> 01:36.400]  Again, this is your body doing this.
[01:36.400 --> 01:38.840]  You don't have to spend a dime to achieve this.
[01:38.840 --> 01:39.840]  That's me saying that.
[01:39.840 --> 01:41.040]  I didn't say that.
[01:41.040 --> 01:46.000]  I also weigh about the same as I did as a teen and I am over 50.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.520]  I am also off every RX in capital letters and I feel great.
[01:50.560 --> 01:52.480]  I can't wait to get some of your ISOs.
[01:52.480 --> 01:53.320]  They are so cute.
[01:53.320 --> 01:59.360]  I have a 4x4 tent as a test for Layton's Horizontal System and the Blue Mats.
[01:59.360 --> 02:01.920]  It's fixed all my problems so far.
[02:01.920 --> 02:05.240]  So once I redo everything, I'll save up to get some more.
[02:05.240 --> 02:07.600]  Thanks again for everything you do.
[02:07.600 --> 02:09.480]  And crew, Cliff.
[02:09.480 --> 02:14.760]  So just wanted to share that because intermittent fasting to me or autophagy, all those things
[02:14.760 --> 02:18.280]  that we kind of were talking briefly on, Alexa, it's another...
[02:18.360 --> 02:23.080]  It reminds me of living soil like eight years ago or whatever, where it just sounds too
[02:23.080 --> 02:25.720]  good to be true that most people write it off.
[02:25.720 --> 02:27.760]  So I just wanted to share that to kick it off.
[02:27.760 --> 02:32.000]  I know, Alexa, you have a lot of great questions that I wanted to allow you to give to Layton.
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.160]  Unfortunately, he was sick last week.
[02:34.160 --> 02:36.400]  Well, not even just sick, buddy.
[02:36.400 --> 02:37.400]  You're in pain.
[02:37.400 --> 02:38.600]  I was sick yesterday.
[02:38.600 --> 02:43.120]  So I apologize to you guys that we weren't able to do the show yesterday, but I wanted
[02:43.120 --> 02:46.360]  to let Layton kind of talk about a few things.
[02:46.440 --> 02:48.840]  And then Alexa, let's get into your questions.
[02:48.840 --> 02:51.680]  And of course, we also have Chandler today.
[02:51.680 --> 02:54.200]  Appreciate you coming back on the show as well, sir.
[02:54.200 --> 02:56.760]  We're going to obviously get into a deep dive.
[02:56.760 --> 03:01.120]  Was that me?
[03:01.120 --> 03:05.720]  That was something Chandler.
[03:05.720 --> 03:08.040]  Chandler, let's hear you again.
[03:08.040 --> 03:10.040]  Say something.
[03:10.040 --> 03:14.360]  He's got the feedback.
[03:15.360 --> 03:17.360]  Yeah, I think.
[03:17.360 --> 03:19.640]  All right, I'm going to mute you.
[03:19.640 --> 03:31.680]  But in settings, click on audio and make sure that like here, let me let me for illustrative
[03:31.680 --> 03:37.320]  purposes, make sure you can hear us through here.
[03:37.320 --> 03:39.800]  Give me a thumbs up if you can hear us through here.
[03:39.960 --> 03:47.800]  OK, so now just make sure that you're speaking through, I guess, your your that thing.
[03:47.800 --> 03:53.520]  So if you go into settings and audio and then you have a better now.
[03:53.720 --> 03:55.040]  Yes, that is amazing.
[03:55.240 --> 03:55.760]  All right.
[03:56.800 --> 03:57.320]  Cool.
[03:57.960 --> 03:58.720]  So, boom.
[03:59.240 --> 04:00.160]  Yeah, no problem, man.
[04:00.560 --> 04:03.440]  I tease is part of this, I guess.
[04:04.080 --> 04:07.760]  So, yeah, I wanted to kind of let you talk about a few things.
[04:08.240 --> 04:09.720]  You know what happened to you last week?
[04:09.720 --> 04:11.160]  And then let's really get into the show.
[04:11.160 --> 04:11.840]  I know a lot of people.
[04:11.840 --> 04:13.440]  I hope you have your pen and paper ready to go.
[04:13.760 --> 04:14.440]  I know I do.
[04:16.760 --> 04:23.200]  Yeah, I had a disectomy in 2001, so basically they removed the jelly inside your disc.
[04:24.360 --> 04:26.720]  So that creates pressure on the disc above and below.
[04:26.720 --> 04:31.320]  And periodically a nerve will work its way in between the discs and pinch.
[04:31.320 --> 04:33.880]  And when that happens, it's it's pretty painful.
[04:34.600 --> 04:40.080]  It can happen in the back of your leg, your buttocks, your lower back, mid back, upper back.
[04:40.080 --> 04:41.480]  And in this case, it was my neck.
[04:42.160 --> 04:51.920]  So basically what happened was I think of it like when you get a foot cramp and your curls and it's really fucking painful as hell.
[04:51.920 --> 04:55.800]  And as long as you can straighten it out, you can kind of avoid the pain.
[04:55.840 --> 05:01.280]  Well, you can't avoid when your muscle stretches from your shoulder up to your neck and cramps like that.
[05:01.280 --> 05:05.720]  So it was you guys like when it hit you, I was on the ground.
[05:06.200 --> 05:07.280]  It was so painful.
[05:07.280 --> 05:11.280]  And so I nuked up with muscle relaxants, waited an hour, nothing.
[05:12.120 --> 05:18.720]  I dropped a fucking morphine from Pauline's cancer battle that should have taken me the fuck out.
[05:18.720 --> 05:20.840]  And it didn't dropped an oxy.
[05:20.840 --> 05:21.800]  That didn't work.
[05:21.800 --> 05:25.680]  Dropped another muscle relaxant with CBD crude.
[05:26.320 --> 05:28.280]  Finally, that started to slow things down.
[05:28.280 --> 05:30.320]  But by 11 o'clock, you guys, I was drooling.
[05:30.360 --> 05:31.520]  I mean, it was really bad.
[05:31.520 --> 05:33.760]  So I apologize about missing it.
[05:33.760 --> 05:36.680]  But, you know, this shit happens once in a while.
[05:36.680 --> 05:39.400]  But that was probably the worst one I've ever experienced.
[05:39.400 --> 05:42.440]  And every time it spasmed, it was just like fucking hell.
[05:43.720 --> 05:45.920]  So I apologize for missing the show.
[05:45.920 --> 05:47.120]  But I'm back.
[05:47.440 --> 05:49.600]  I'm still a little sore, but hey, I'm good.
[05:50.120 --> 05:51.400]  So happy to be here.
[05:51.800 --> 05:52.600]  Glad you're back, man.
[05:53.560 --> 05:54.520]  Sorry to hear about that.
[05:54.760 --> 05:56.280]  Truly does sound like hell for sure.
[05:56.600 --> 05:57.760]  Yeah, not not fun.
[05:57.760 --> 05:59.240]  Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
[05:59.280 --> 05:59.960]  That's for sure.
[06:01.200 --> 06:01.680]  Yeah.
[06:02.240 --> 06:02.760]  Let's get it.
[06:02.760 --> 06:06.800]  Share with us that morphine and heroin weren't weren't working for you.
[06:06.800 --> 06:09.360]  I mean, that's that's a next level pain right there.
[06:09.880 --> 06:12.920]  Well, you know, when your body gets so
[06:13.880 --> 06:16.800]  filled with adrenaline, there's nothing you can do.
[06:16.800 --> 06:20.440]  I mean, the cops shoot people with tasers when they're when they're lit up
[06:20.440 --> 06:23.000]  like Christmas trees and it doesn't do anything.
[06:23.000 --> 06:28.080]  So that can show you the extent of, you know, a pinched nerve is is pretty
[06:28.520 --> 06:29.520]  pretty drastic.
[06:30.320 --> 06:32.920]  But again, you know, it's part of it's part of life.
[06:32.920 --> 06:35.600]  And for the most part, they're not usually that bad.
[06:35.600 --> 06:38.400]  So that was a that was a special one for sure.
[06:41.120 --> 06:44.720]  All right. Well, I mean, we've almost done this for like a year and a half late.
[06:44.840 --> 06:49.360]  And so we each missed one episode this week, you know, so we've been
[06:50.000 --> 06:51.600]  we've been on it for a long time.
[06:51.600 --> 06:54.000]  I guess if we have to miss one, we both miss one for a week.
[06:54.000 --> 06:57.800]  So back to not missing any more episodes and staying healthy.
[06:58.800 --> 07:01.800]  So, Alexa, I wanted to kind of let you have the platform.
[07:01.800 --> 07:04.040]  I know that you had some deeper questions.
[07:04.040 --> 07:05.480]  I thought there were fabulous questions.
[07:05.480 --> 07:07.760]  And obviously, let's kind of let Leighton talk into that.
[07:08.320 --> 07:10.520]  Chandler, if you have something that you want to add into that, buddy,
[07:10.600 --> 07:14.960]  please feel free to chime in at any time and then we'll chop it up as a group as well.
[07:14.960 --> 07:18.880]  But I know that you had some very unique questions you wanted to ask.
[07:20.320 --> 07:21.840]  Sure. Yeah.
[07:21.840 --> 07:24.640]  So first, Leighton, so glad you're feeling better.
[07:24.640 --> 07:29.760]  And so basically, I just wanted to open up a conversation
[07:29.760 --> 07:33.760]  about aerobic and anaerobic organisms.
[07:33.760 --> 07:38.000]  And this is because of my experience
[07:38.480 --> 07:42.960]  with studying like Elaine's work and taking her classes.
[07:44.200 --> 07:47.960]  I, you know, was in the mindset
[07:48.440 --> 07:51.680]  and the way I interpreted her work was,
[07:52.320 --> 07:55.360]  you know, anaerobic organisms are bad.
[07:55.360 --> 07:56.720]  We shouldn't be using them.
[07:56.720 --> 08:02.240]  And then, you know, only to focus on using the aerobic organisms.
[08:04.520 --> 08:08.600]  So, yeah, I shared this story last time about how I
[08:09.800 --> 08:13.760]  bought the Jadam book around the same time I started taking Elaine's class
[08:13.760 --> 08:17.680]  and I started reading it and, you know, I just dismissed the information
[08:17.680 --> 08:19.280]  right away and put it down.
[08:19.320 --> 08:23.760]  And, you know, it was like, how is this working for people?
[08:23.760 --> 08:27.680]  I really just, you know, didn't believe it based off, you know,
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.920]  what I was learning from Elaine's courses.
[08:31.920 --> 08:35.440]  So I, you know,
[08:36.560 --> 08:39.760]  through like the compost cup and our regenerative community,
[08:39.760 --> 08:44.840]  I started seeing all these different farmers using fermented inputs
[08:44.840 --> 08:47.160]  and having just like amazing success.
[08:47.160 --> 08:53.280]  So, you know, I started wondering, like, how could this be and things like that?
[08:53.280 --> 08:59.240]  So I, you know, started talking to Chandler about it and he was
[09:01.040 --> 09:03.480]  kind of helped me realize
[09:03.480 --> 09:08.560]  that there are there is a place for anaerobic organisms.
[09:08.560 --> 09:14.200]  And, you know, they can be very beneficial for the soil.
[09:14.200 --> 09:17.520]  Like we had a conversation that,
[09:18.800 --> 09:22.640]  you know, was like, OK, we can use anaerobic organisms
[09:23.080 --> 09:27.320]  and they can become a food resource for for other organisms.
[09:27.320 --> 09:31.280]  And that's kind of what sparked me to be like, OK, wow,
[09:31.520 --> 09:36.480]  this can be used in certain applications to build soil
[09:36.480 --> 09:39.920]  and start, you know, breaking down compaction because,
[09:40.480 --> 09:43.960]  you know, it like something that Chandler said is that,
[09:43.960 --> 09:46.840]  you know, it doesn't really make sense to be adding aerobic
[09:48.840 --> 09:51.520]  organisms to a compacted soil.
[09:51.520 --> 09:54.960]  So we get those anaerobic organisms in there to start, you know,
[09:54.960 --> 09:59.080]  breaking things down and making things available
[09:59.640 --> 10:03.200]  for indigenous IMO and things like that.
[10:04.040 --> 10:08.160]  So I guess my intention of bringing this up is that I just didn't want anyone else
[10:08.160 --> 10:11.240]  to get stuck in like the black and white thinking
[10:11.600 --> 10:16.680]  because the soil is such a complex and diverse ecosystem.
[10:16.680 --> 10:18.920]  It's ever changing and adapting.
[10:18.920 --> 10:23.000]  And aerobic and anaerobic organisms, you know, work together.
[10:23.360 --> 10:25.640]  And it's just like
[10:26.880 --> 10:31.000]  something that a gentleman we've been following named
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.040]  Quattamoc says he's like, you know, they're just like different cultures.
[10:36.040 --> 10:37.920]  They just speak different languages.
[10:37.920 --> 10:42.760]  So basically, by having these aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the soil,
[10:42.760 --> 10:47.000]  you know, you're building cultural diversity in your soil as well.
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.600]  So, yeah, I just wanted to bring that up and
[10:53.080 --> 10:55.000]  have a discussion about it.
[10:56.720 --> 10:58.840]  Well, you know, go ahead, go ahead, Jim.
[11:00.920 --> 11:03.120]  Oh, OK. I don't know.
[11:03.120 --> 11:06.280]  Actually, it sounds like there's some feedback,
[11:06.320 --> 11:08.320]  it sounds like there's some feedback again.
[11:08.320 --> 11:09.320]  Peter?
[11:09.320 --> 11:11.320]  And almost a delay.
[11:11.320 --> 11:13.320]  You guys all hearing a delay?
[11:16.040 --> 11:18.040]  I'm getting a delay.
[11:19.320 --> 11:27.840]  Peter, how are you?
[11:29.840 --> 11:30.840]  Whoa.
[11:32.320 --> 11:34.320]  Why am I hearing my mic?
[11:34.320 --> 11:36.760]  Check, check, check.
[11:36.920 --> 11:39.400]  OK, I think it's Alexa's computer.
[11:39.400 --> 11:41.600]  So just when you're not talking, mute yourself.
[11:41.880 --> 11:43.880]  All right, Chandler, let's
[11:44.600 --> 11:47.280]  let's go live with your mic.
[11:47.280 --> 11:48.400]  Can you hear me?
[11:48.400 --> 11:49.520]  I sure can.
[11:49.520 --> 11:53.240]  All right. Yeah, just do you have do you have earbuds?
[11:53.400 --> 11:55.240]  Do you have headphones now?
[11:55.240 --> 11:57.840]  By your old school.
[11:58.360 --> 12:00.480]  All right. Go for it.
[12:00.480 --> 12:03.760]  Just got this fancy headset here for Shango's podcast the other day.
[12:04.400 --> 12:06.600]  Get a microphone attachment there.
[12:06.600 --> 12:09.080]  But yeah, nature's not black and white.
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.240]  And we don't talk enough about the facultative microbes
[12:13.520 --> 12:17.120]  that can exist in oxygen, richer oxygen, depleted environments.
[12:17.640 --> 12:20.680]  And there's once you start thinking about it like that,
[12:20.680 --> 12:24.080]  there's so many different uses for an anaerobic ferment
[12:24.360 --> 12:26.560]  or an actively aerated compost tea.
[12:26.560 --> 12:29.680]  But like she was saying, doesn't necessarily make sense to,
[12:30.280 --> 12:32.440]  you know, brew a compost tea, spend all this time
[12:33.320 --> 12:37.760]  creating these microbes that thrive in a highly oxygenated environment
[12:37.760 --> 12:39.800]  and then apply them
[12:41.240 --> 12:45.320]  to a compacted soil where they're not going to thrive
[12:45.320 --> 12:49.960]  because the environment is what dictates the function of these organisms and stuff.
[12:49.960 --> 12:50.480]  And so like
[12:51.880 --> 12:55.440]  those oxygenated microbes in the tea aren't going to thrive in that compacted soil.
[12:55.440 --> 12:59.080]  So it might make more sense, you know, if you have super compacted soil
[12:59.080 --> 13:02.840]  to hit it with a JADAM liquid fertilizer first,
[13:03.360 --> 13:06.960]  kind of break that up and introduce the microbes that will thrive there.
[13:06.960 --> 13:10.840]  And then from there, they'll start to break stuff down, like she was saying,
[13:10.840 --> 13:14.440]  produce all of these secondary and tertiary metabolites
[13:14.760 --> 13:17.440]  that are then food sources for all these other microbes.
[13:17.440 --> 13:20.960]  And so like when you apply any of these
[13:24.240 --> 13:27.680]  microbes, they become food stock for your indigenous microbes.
[13:27.680 --> 13:31.120]  And so even like something like EM or something that isn't indigenous,
[13:31.120 --> 13:34.720]  you know, store cultured microbes become a food stock
[13:34.720 --> 13:36.960]  once you apply it for your indigenous microbes.
[13:38.720 --> 13:41.600]  And I can't hear like anybody, I can't hear myself.
[13:44.880 --> 13:49.240]  When I have that issue, Chandler, I leave and come back and the issue is fixed.
[13:49.600 --> 13:51.680]  OK, so if you want to.
[13:51.720 --> 13:55.640]  Yeah, just refresh the browser and then just come right back in.
[13:58.910 --> 13:59.350]  All right.
[14:00.110 --> 14:04.190]  Well, yeah, I'll talk a little bit on on this, too,
[14:04.190 --> 14:07.710]  because I agree with both of you, and I think what Chandler was talking about
[14:07.710 --> 14:11.310]  was microbial solution, the JADAM microbial solution.
[14:11.630 --> 14:12.870]  Yeah, correct.
[14:12.870 --> 14:16.030]  Because you you actually said something different.
[14:16.030 --> 14:18.150]  But anyway, oh, yeah, the liquid fertilizer.
[14:18.150 --> 14:19.070]  Right.
[14:21.070 --> 14:25.750]  I agree 100 percent in the work that I've been doing for a number of years now.
[14:25.750 --> 14:28.550]  I'll often get called into a compacted soil situation.
[14:30.550 --> 14:38.070]  And the way I found the best way I found to jump start it is to use the faculties.
[14:38.110 --> 14:42.990]  So my early work was was studying fish manure.
[14:43.710 --> 14:48.910]  And in these aquaculture facilities, the manure gets very, very ripe.
[14:48.910 --> 14:50.790]  I mean, it stinks to hell.
[14:50.790 --> 14:54.750]  And so it's a very, very important thing.
[14:55.390 --> 14:59.830]  So in working with these aquaculture companies and trying to stabilize
[15:00.630 --> 15:04.670]  the anaerobes so that I get the facultative as well as the aerobes,
[15:04.670 --> 15:08.470]  I would have to do a lot of work in what's called aerobic stabilization,
[15:08.470 --> 15:12.550]  which is basically just exposing this material to vigorous bubbling
[15:13.310 --> 15:14.430]  over periods of time.
[15:14.430 --> 15:17.590]  And there were there were cases where I would actually brew this stuff
[15:17.590 --> 15:20.550]  for for two weeks and still not get it to turn.
[15:20.790 --> 15:23.190]  Well, so yeah, and it was it was bad.
[15:23.190 --> 15:26.390]  And you get this stuff on you and you smell for three or four days.
[15:26.390 --> 15:27.910]  You can't get it off.
[15:27.910 --> 15:30.950]  So, you know, that just goes to show you how potent it can be.
[15:31.270 --> 15:34.990]  Yeah. And, you know, I had these conversations with Elaine,
[15:34.990 --> 15:38.670]  you know, years and years ago about, you know, her
[15:39.430 --> 15:42.430]  her ball and banishing anaerobes.
[15:42.430 --> 15:46.550]  And I was like, but Elaine, you know, when you're dealing with these kinds of soil
[15:46.550 --> 15:50.950]  situations, you know, why are you so against this stuff?
[15:50.950 --> 15:54.630]  And she explained to me because, you know, I was basically almost
[15:55.030 --> 15:59.110]  pushed out of my whole career due to a woman brewing
[15:59.470 --> 16:04.430]  fresh cow manure with molasses and creating a, you know, a horribly
[16:05.870 --> 16:10.070]  ecolide situation where she poured this on plants and killed them
[16:10.510 --> 16:12.510]  and documented it.
[16:12.510 --> 16:15.870]  So she was she was working against compost tea.
[16:15.870 --> 16:19.590]  And lo and behold, that same woman retired shortly thereafter
[16:20.190 --> 16:22.990]  and disappeared. So who paid her off? Right.
[16:23.630 --> 16:29.150]  Well, so that's why she's so adamantly against anaerobes is because of,
[16:29.150 --> 16:33.910]  you know, the the abuse that she took from from the industry as a whole
[16:33.910 --> 16:39.230]  that was trying to prevent us, the people from having these tools
[16:39.230 --> 16:42.430]  that we could make ourselves and forcing us to buy.
[16:43.430 --> 16:47.270]  Synthetic fertilizers, which would then require insecticides,
[16:47.310 --> 16:49.190]  herbicides, et cetera, et cetera.
[16:49.190 --> 16:53.990]  So, you know, that's that's the reason why she was was adamantly against it.
[16:54.030 --> 16:57.790]  But in a lot of lessons that I learned from her,
[16:58.710 --> 17:01.070]  I learned by doing the opposite of what she told me
[17:01.830 --> 17:07.030]  and trying it because, you know, I could I didn't have anybody stopping me.
[17:07.830 --> 17:10.630]  So anyway, to to make a long story short,
[17:11.510 --> 17:15.430]  you know, it was several years later that I learned that by not
[17:15.590 --> 17:20.310]  aerobically stabilizing it to a sweet smell, but letting it still have a funk to it.
[17:20.630 --> 17:23.430]  Yeah. I could look under the microscope.
[17:23.430 --> 17:28.110]  I would see all these facultative anaerobes, not I see some ciliates, but more so
[17:28.870 --> 17:32.390]  rotifers, stock ciliates,
[17:32.990 --> 17:36.470]  you know, some of these other organisms that can live in between the two.
[17:36.630 --> 17:39.070]  Yeah. And stock ciliates are really cool.
[17:39.070 --> 17:43.230]  They basically are they look like a bulb of a plant
[17:43.630 --> 17:47.470]  and they have a stock that allows them to attach to different things.
[17:48.110 --> 17:52.750]  And you can see them literally open up when when there's just enough
[17:53.030 --> 17:56.230]  where the oxygen level is just low enough that they can survive.
[17:56.230 --> 17:58.790]  And as soon as the oxygen goes up, they close again.
[17:59.630 --> 18:01.470]  And so it's really interesting.
[18:01.470 --> 18:05.230]  And I started studying the D.O. to see where that level was.
[18:05.630 --> 18:09.270]  And as soon as it got to about seven or eight parts per million,
[18:09.270 --> 18:12.590]  those those little guys would close up and insist.
[18:13.270 --> 18:16.990]  So, you know, and also like looking at the mechanical
[18:18.310 --> 18:20.990]  abilities of these organisms.
[18:20.990 --> 18:24.790]  There you go. Right on, Peter.
[18:24.790 --> 18:28.830]  Normally that see those two little antennas that are whipping around those
[18:28.830 --> 18:31.910]  that mouth would actually be open and those antennas would be like
[18:32.630 --> 18:34.510]  sweeping stuff into their mouth.
[18:34.510 --> 18:37.630]  But this this this one, it looks like it's just at that cusp
[18:37.630 --> 18:39.550]  of between seven and eight parts per million.
[18:40.550 --> 18:44.310]  But that literally looks like my Roomba, wherever the hell that thing's called.
[18:47.070 --> 18:49.430]  All right. So think about that. Right.
[18:49.430 --> 18:53.630]  Think about ciliates and stock ciliates and rotifers.
[18:54.390 --> 18:58.670]  The amount of decompaction that those guys can do
[18:58.670 --> 19:03.310]  in just in their mechanical existence is insane.
[19:04.430 --> 19:08.710]  So when you're trying to, you know, decompact soil, because
[19:09.110 --> 19:12.950]  let's let's let's get into the physical component of aggregates. Right.
[19:12.950 --> 19:17.230]  So in a in a highly aerobic soil, you're going to have a tremendous
[19:17.230 --> 19:20.830]  amount of aggregates and those aggregates form pockets in between them.
[19:21.630 --> 19:25.990]  It allows for gas exchange for allows moisture to come in and sink in
[19:25.990 --> 19:30.030]  and get absorbed into those little micro and macro aggregates.
[19:30.550 --> 19:33.670]  And as soon as you have compaction, you have zero aggregation.
[19:33.750 --> 19:36.670]  So how do you get to aggregation when you're zero?
[19:37.270 --> 19:39.910]  The only way you can do that is through biofilm,
[19:39.910 --> 19:43.190]  which is through heavy bacterial dominated
[19:44.190 --> 19:48.430]  applications of organisms, whether it's EM, whether it's Jadam
[19:49.030 --> 19:54.830]  microbial solution or even even a compost that isn't like really smell sweet.
[19:55.470 --> 19:57.510]  So, you know, anybody can do this.
[19:57.590 --> 20:01.590]  And but to be honest with you, that is the best way
[20:02.070 --> 20:06.230]  to turn shit around quickly and anybody that can sit there and tell me,
[20:06.230 --> 20:09.430]  well, there's no such thing or anaerobes don't live in the soil
[20:09.430 --> 20:11.350]  profiles or the aggregates.
[20:11.350 --> 20:13.550]  All I do is say, hey, what about heavy rain, dude?
[20:15.350 --> 20:18.470]  Yeah. What the fuck happens 24 hours after heavy rain?
[20:18.590 --> 20:22.270]  You think that your aerobes are all just bumbling around happily
[20:22.270 --> 20:24.790]  and very little oxygen?
[20:24.790 --> 20:26.790]  So the answer is no. They're they're critical.
[20:26.790 --> 20:30.550]  The anaerobes, the facultatives and the aerobes are all critical
[20:30.550 --> 20:32.870]  in all soil profiles. Absolutely.
[20:32.950 --> 20:38.270]  Would I pour a, you know, a super nasty, stinking
[20:39.630 --> 20:41.710]  tea on an aerobic soil?
[20:41.710 --> 20:43.830]  Fuck no, I wouldn't do that. Exactly.
[20:44.590 --> 20:47.470]  So, I mean, yeah, there are exceptions to the rule,
[20:47.470 --> 20:51.350]  but also understand that these guys all live in communities,
[20:51.350 --> 20:55.350]  like you were saying, which is, you know, important that you take that
[20:55.350 --> 20:59.670]  into consideration, you know, in in everything, like even in watering.
[20:59.990 --> 21:02.350]  If you over water, what have you done?
[21:02.350 --> 21:04.750]  You know, you've you've knocked your aerobics back.
[21:04.790 --> 21:08.350]  That either they've insisted or they've they've died because you killed it.
[21:08.390 --> 21:09.870]  You choked them out.
[21:09.870 --> 21:12.990]  And the same is true as if it's if it's too aerobic.
[21:13.070 --> 21:16.630]  I mean, I did some work early on at Rodale where I thought,
[21:17.030 --> 21:20.110]  you know, a common sense, you know, rain, Elaine's having problem
[21:20.110 --> 21:24.630]  getting her oxygen, her DO level in the water columns of her brewers
[21:24.630 --> 21:27.470]  to the right level to throw out these aerobes.
[21:28.190 --> 21:31.110]  So I was like, well, why don't I just fucking hit it with pure oxygen?
[21:31.270 --> 21:36.550]  Right. And just diffuse the oxygen in bubbles and try it that way.
[21:36.670 --> 21:38.590]  I oxidized everything.
[21:38.590 --> 21:41.670]  Too much. I fucking killed everything within about five minutes.
[21:42.230 --> 21:45.470]  So it goes to show you that, you know, you can't do these extremes
[21:45.470 --> 21:47.550]  and expect to have a result.
[21:47.550 --> 21:51.350]  Well, or a nasty anaerobic tea on an aerobic
[21:52.070 --> 21:54.110]  soil system where you're going to go backwards.
[21:55.790 --> 21:58.190]  So you'd like you guys want to chime in on that a little bit?
[21:58.470 --> 21:59.750]  That's awesome.
[21:59.750 --> 22:03.070]  Yeah, I mean, that's what I've been coming to lately as well.
[22:03.070 --> 22:06.870]  It's just like everything like what it says in the book,
[22:06.870 --> 22:08.270]  the good and the bad are one.
[22:08.270 --> 22:12.350]  So basically saying like, you know, everything is good and balanced.
[22:12.350 --> 22:16.830]  And then once you get to these extremes, that's when you're going to see problems.
[22:18.470 --> 22:23.230]  And yeah, I just want to say to like, I just like highly admire
[22:23.230 --> 22:26.830]  and support like Elaine's work and and like,
[22:26.830 --> 22:31.710]  you know, applying her practices to the grow at Haifa have,
[22:31.710 --> 22:36.150]  you know, completely changed the health of health of our plants and increased,
[22:37.070 --> 22:38.550]  you know, the health of our plants.
[22:38.550 --> 22:41.310]  And I love using the microscope as a tool.
[22:41.310 --> 22:45.630]  It's incredible to be able to, you know,
[22:45.630 --> 22:48.270]  understand these organisms at that level.
[22:48.270 --> 22:50.430]  So, yeah.
[22:50.430 --> 22:55.230]  And also I do want to talk about an experience
[22:55.830 --> 23:00.430]  yesterday I got to look at some JLF
[23:00.430 --> 23:03.390]  that I made under the microscope for the first time.
[23:03.390 --> 23:08.910]  And I was like super excited because it was so diverse.
[23:08.910 --> 23:13.550]  Like I, you know, have looked at ferments and things under the microscope before.
[23:13.550 --> 23:17.510]  And I've mostly just seen like bacteria and yeast.
[23:17.510 --> 23:22.590]  But, you know, I made this JLF with food scrap and leaf mold humus.
[23:23.150 --> 23:31.150]  And I was just shocked at the amount of like filamentous fungi I was seeing in there.
[23:31.150 --> 23:39.150]  You know, like I really wasn't expecting to see so much diversity.
[23:39.150 --> 23:45.390]  So it's just like really cool that that's like a almost a complete fertilizer
[23:45.390 --> 23:49.310]  because there was tons of, you know, protozoa in there.
[23:49.310 --> 23:51.150]  You know, most of them were ciliates.
[23:51.230 --> 23:53.870]  But nutrient cycling is happening.
[23:53.870 --> 24:02.270]  And so it's just a very easy way to make a complete fertilizer.
[24:04.270 --> 24:07.350]  Yeah. And don't stop there.
[24:07.350 --> 24:08.710]  I mean, ferment plants.
[24:08.710 --> 24:10.310]  I talk about this often.
[24:10.310 --> 24:15.110]  Get kelp, get seaweed, get, you know, any kind of algae out of the creek
[24:15.110 --> 24:18.870]  and put it in a bucket of water and let it sit in the sun for five days
[24:18.870 --> 24:20.630]  until it gets foamy at the top.
[24:20.710 --> 24:22.070]  And then microscope that shit.
[24:22.070 --> 24:23.910]  That'll blow your freaking mind out.
[24:23.910 --> 24:24.470]  Absolutely.
[24:24.470 --> 24:30.550]  I love Chandler that you talk about bacteria or bio-stimulants because they are.
[24:30.550 --> 24:31.910]  They're a food source, man.
[24:31.910 --> 24:34.550]  They're crazy down there.
[24:34.550 --> 24:36.390]  Everything's just feeding off each other.
[24:36.390 --> 24:37.590]  It's absolutely amazing.
[24:37.590 --> 24:40.630]  That's something that's so cool about learning about EM.
[24:40.630 --> 24:43.030]  And I know that there are some questions about this last week.
[24:44.470 --> 24:49.110]  But the synergy that happens in that EM brew where you have anaerobic microbes
[24:49.270 --> 24:52.310]  living synergistically with aerobic microbes.
[24:52.310 --> 24:56.470]  They're living off of each other's byproducts and feeding each other.
[24:56.470 --> 25:00.390]  And, you know, if we stuck to the school of thought where, oh, anaerobic's bad,
[25:00.390 --> 25:04.390]  aerobic's good, like we wouldn't have even tried those together and like came up
[25:04.390 --> 25:06.230]  with this amazing discovery.
[25:06.230 --> 25:11.830]  But I know Peter was asking if there was ways to make EM yourself without,
[25:11.830 --> 25:13.510]  you know, having to buy a bottle of it.
[25:13.510 --> 25:14.390]  And there definitely are.
[25:14.390 --> 25:17.110]  So we could talk about that a little bit.
[25:17.190 --> 25:21.190]  So basically, what makes EM so much more effective.
[25:21.830 --> 25:24.310]  Sorry, I just realized my headphones went out again.
[25:24.870 --> 25:26.070]  I don't know if it really matters.
[25:30.070 --> 25:30.870]  Can I hear you guys?
[25:30.870 --> 25:32.150]  We can hear you.
[25:32.150 --> 25:32.710]  You can hear?
[25:32.710 --> 25:32.950]  Okay.
[25:32.950 --> 25:34.070]  So I guess it doesn't matter.
[25:34.070 --> 25:34.630]  I can hear myself.
[25:34.630 --> 25:35.670]  Why don't you do this?
[25:35.670 --> 25:37.590]  Go on your talk.
[25:37.590 --> 25:40.710]  And then as soon as you're done speaking, pop off and pop back on.
[25:40.710 --> 25:41.270]  Sounds good.
[25:41.910 --> 25:42.390]  All right.
[25:42.950 --> 25:46.550]  What makes EM so much more beneficial than a bottle of it?
[25:46.950 --> 25:50.070]  So what makes EM so beneficial than, you know,
[25:50.070 --> 25:55.110]  just lab that you can culture yourself is lab.
[25:55.110 --> 25:55.430]  Okay.
[25:55.430 --> 26:00.230]  So EM has both your lactic acid bacteria and yeast, which you'll also find in lab
[26:00.230 --> 26:03.510]  that you culture, but it has purple non-sulfur bacteria.
[26:03.510 --> 26:06.390]  And that's like the main thing that differentiates it.
[26:06.390 --> 26:10.630]  And so you have your PNSB, which can feed four different ways, which is fascinating.
[26:11.590 --> 26:15.270]  It can be, you know, saprobic, it can feed off of carbohydrates,
[26:15.270 --> 26:19.430]  drive off of heat, get its energy from heat and thermophilic environments.
[26:19.430 --> 26:21.110]  And so like they find it in volcanoes.
[26:21.990 --> 26:27.590]  It can also break down toxins and, you know, eat toxic material and turn that into
[26:27.590 --> 26:30.390]  fulvic and amino acids, stuff that the plant can use.
[26:31.510 --> 26:33.510]  It can, what's the fourth one?
[26:34.310 --> 26:36.390]  It's a, oh, photosynthetic.
[26:36.390 --> 26:39.670]  And so it gets its energy from the sun and anaerobic conditions.
[26:39.670 --> 26:45.750]  And so it's just, it goes to show how long this microbe has been around and how
[26:46.390 --> 26:48.630]  well it's evolved to all these different conditions.
[26:49.510 --> 26:54.950]  It would make sense that, you know, it's one of the first ones to happen on earth
[26:54.950 --> 26:58.310]  because of how many ways that it can survive and the fact that it can survive in those
[26:58.310 --> 27:00.230]  thermophilic extreme conditions.
[27:01.350 --> 27:06.790]  But basically you have the purple non-sulfur bacteria, which is also found in the biome
[27:06.790 --> 27:12.150]  of the worm, which is really fascinating and awesome because wormies and all that stuff.
[27:12.150 --> 27:21.110]  But so you can culture your own EM by using quality worm castings, as well as either the
[27:21.750 --> 27:27.270]  lab that you culture yourself or kombucha or kefir, both have the lactic acid bacteria,
[27:27.270 --> 27:29.590]  as well as the yeast in there.
[27:29.590 --> 27:34.550]  And if you wanted to, you can even go out and buy brewer's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
[27:34.550 --> 27:40.470]  and mix all three of those microbes, the PNSB, the LAB, and the yeast.
[27:41.030 --> 27:46.070]  And then so you have one part of that, and then you'd measure out an equal part of molasses
[27:46.710 --> 27:48.630]  and 20 parts water.
[27:48.630 --> 27:54.310]  And then you'd add the microbes to the water first, and then you'd store in the molasses.
[27:55.030 --> 27:57.110]  You don't want to add the molasses right to the microbes.
[27:57.110 --> 27:59.830]  You want to do the microbes in the water and then the molasses.
[27:59.830 --> 28:05.510]  And then you let that ferment, same way that you'd do if you were expanding a store-bought
[28:05.510 --> 28:06.550]  bottle of LAB.
[28:06.550 --> 28:09.030]  And so you want warmer conditions, just like any ferment.
[28:09.750 --> 28:14.630]  But if you get around 80 degrees, that's where things are going to happen really, really fast.
[28:14.630 --> 28:17.830]  And so you're just going to look for that pH drop.
[28:17.830 --> 28:23.190]  And so that's what the lactic acid bacteria is good at, is dropping that pH and out-competing
[28:23.190 --> 28:27.910]  everything else, except for the PNSB because they work synergistically.
[28:27.910 --> 28:34.470]  But that's what makes lacto-ferments so popular for preserving food, and that makes it safe
[28:34.470 --> 28:40.630]  for us to eat, is that lactic acid bacteria will drop the pH down to under 4.
[28:40.630 --> 28:47.910]  And that rapid drop is going to out-compete any pathogens and make sure that that ferment
[28:47.910 --> 28:50.550]  is just those microbes that it should be.
[28:50.870 --> 28:56.790]  But yeah, either if you buy a bottle the one time and keep on expanding it, or you try
[28:56.790 --> 29:00.070]  to make it yourself, EM is absolutely fantastic.
[29:00.790 --> 29:07.830]  But another cool thing that not a lot of people talk about is, so if you do buy a bottle of
[29:07.830 --> 29:12.870]  EM and you just feed it molasses and expand it, you can do that a couple times.
[29:12.870 --> 29:19.110]  But over some time, your levels of the PNSB are going to diminish, and it's mainly going
[29:19.190 --> 29:22.310]  to be lactic acid bacteria and yeast.
[29:22.310 --> 29:27.270]  And so in order to prevent that, you can add something called bioceramics, which I wanted
[29:27.270 --> 29:30.070]  to talk to you late and see if you're familiar with this.
[29:30.070 --> 29:38.150]  But these bioceramics are basically like silica that they heated at like 2000 degrees and
[29:38.150 --> 29:40.950]  then inoculated with these microbes.
[29:40.950 --> 29:47.910]  And so now you have like bioceramic powder, or they make like a bead form, and they emit
[29:48.230 --> 29:50.630]  far infrared waves.
[29:50.630 --> 29:57.910]  And so those waves that are coming out of these bioceramics are sending, it encourages
[29:57.910 --> 29:59.830]  mitosis, simply put.
[29:59.830 --> 30:03.750]  And so it encourages cell division.
[30:03.750 --> 30:07.990]  And so that's what keeps the levels of purple non-sulfur bacteria and the ratios that they
[30:07.990 --> 30:09.990]  need to be compared to the lab.
[30:09.990 --> 30:16.310]  And so like Coatamoc Via, which you mentioned earlier, his Instagram is bocashi4u, the number
[30:16.310 --> 30:16.870]  four.
[30:18.150 --> 30:19.510]  He's absolutely incredible.
[30:19.510 --> 30:23.910]  He's taught me a ton about EM and all that cool stuff.
[30:23.910 --> 30:31.030]  But he's had a culture going for 17 years, you know, so you can buy one bottle one time,
[30:31.030 --> 30:34.870]  and if you do it properly, you can keep that solution going.
[30:34.870 --> 30:41.430]  And it's a wonderful resource used on so many things outside of the garden too, on your
[30:41.430 --> 30:43.750]  skin, on your hair, as a cleaning product.
[30:43.750 --> 30:49.510]  You could put that in your humidifier to cleanse your room, and it's going to keep
[30:50.710 --> 30:51.590]  mold at bay.
[30:51.590 --> 30:56.630]  So like after you clean out your mold, a moldy area, you can cleanse your room with these
[30:56.630 --> 30:59.030]  effective microbes, just putting it in the humidifier.
[30:59.030 --> 31:01.350]  And there's so many cool uses for it.
[31:01.350 --> 31:03.110]  So definitely look into effective microbes.
[31:03.110 --> 31:03.990]  That like grub bar.
[31:08.710 --> 31:09.430]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:09.430 --> 31:14.630]  Whoever timestamps our stuff, I hope you would be willing to do that for what Chandler
[31:14.630 --> 31:15.270]  just spoke on.
[31:15.270 --> 31:18.470]  So I love when the community is able to make their own stuff.
[31:18.470 --> 31:23.110]  I mean, of course, I want you to support individuals and companies and stuff that are doing it
[31:23.110 --> 31:23.670]  the right way.
[31:24.310 --> 31:28.950]  But it has always seemed like it was only EM1, or at least here in Denver, so I appreciate
[31:28.950 --> 31:33.510]  you Chandler, where if you wanted to make bocashi, you had to use EM1.
[31:33.510 --> 31:35.190]  That was kind of almost like the gospel.
[31:36.150 --> 31:36.710]  For sure.
[31:36.790 --> 31:41.910]  And there's a couple of great companies here in the States, Terragonics, who makes EM1.
[31:41.910 --> 31:45.430]  But SCD Probiotics is also a really good one.
[31:47.030 --> 31:52.790]  And so you got a couple other options that aren't under the EM1 brand name, but they're
[31:52.790 --> 31:59.910]  still very, very similar consortia of microorganisms that work in concert together.
[32:01.110 --> 32:06.070]  And I appreciate you breaking that down, because from what I always understood, EM1 was just
[32:06.070 --> 32:11.030]  a gentleman that was able to not patent it, but basically create this system.
[32:12.950 --> 32:17.110]  For a long time, I guess, people didn't really understand what was underneath the curtain.
[32:17.830 --> 32:21.510]  And it seemed like that was the only way to do certain things and achieve certain things.
[32:21.510 --> 32:23.510]  So I appreciate you breaking that down.
[32:23.510 --> 32:23.990]  For sure.
[32:23.990 --> 32:26.070]  Dr. Higa is incredible.
[32:26.070 --> 32:28.630]  I'm reading his book, An Earth-Saving Revolution.
[32:28.630 --> 32:33.590]  But they used to, they not even, okay, so when they first started teaching this technology,
[32:33.590 --> 32:37.350]  they made sure that you knew how to expand it and to make it sustainable.
[32:37.350 --> 32:41.110]  They weren't going out and saying, you got to buy this from us every time.
[32:41.110 --> 32:48.790]  And so they literally go and they teach dirt-poor countries how to expand it and that self-sustainability
[32:48.790 --> 32:50.630]  and putting the power back into the farmer's hands.
[32:51.590 --> 32:52.870]  It's a great tool.
[32:52.870 --> 32:56.870]  You can culture a lot of this stuff yourself, but you can also, if you're in a pinch, you
[32:56.870 --> 33:01.190]  need something quick, go buy a $30 bottle and keep it for years.
[33:01.190 --> 33:01.990]  Nothing wrong with that.
[33:04.390 --> 33:07.510]  All right, I'm going to jump up and refresh my microphone.
[33:07.510 --> 33:08.790]  All right, go ahead and do that.
[33:08.790 --> 33:12.390]  And I'll speak a little bit about brewer's waste or distiller's waste.
[33:13.350 --> 33:14.950]  This stuff is amazing.
[33:16.070 --> 33:20.630]  Everybody should be using a small amount of it in their compost building because it becomes
[33:21.910 --> 33:24.310]  a nematode food as it breaks down.
[33:24.310 --> 33:27.670]  And the nematodes just start multiplying like crazy.
[33:28.630 --> 33:34.470]  And I don't know whether it's that they're feeding on those purple sulfur bacteria or
[33:34.470 --> 33:34.710]  not.
[33:35.510 --> 33:41.270]  That I haven't determined, but I tell you this, every time I use that stuff, I had incredible
[33:41.270 --> 33:41.830]  results.
[33:41.830 --> 33:44.070]  Now, please be weary.
[33:44.070 --> 33:45.190]  Do not be a moron.
[33:45.190 --> 33:50.070]  That stuff is high nitrogen and it will force your pile to go thermophilic very quickly
[33:50.070 --> 33:52.550]  or anaerobic very quickly if you use too much of it.
[33:53.270 --> 33:56.870]  It also usually comes very sloppy, very wet.
[33:56.870 --> 34:04.150]  So you almost have to blend it with something dry like hay or straw or a very dry leaf mold
[34:04.150 --> 34:05.830]  to kind of get it to be more.
[34:08.070 --> 34:08.950]  How do I say this?
[34:09.910 --> 34:13.350]  Easier to blend into your soil or blend into your compost.
[34:13.350 --> 34:16.150]  So those are just a couple of heads up on that material.
[34:16.950 --> 34:18.710]  Which material are we talking here?
[34:18.710 --> 34:20.710]  The distillers or brewers waste.
[34:20.710 --> 34:21.750]  OK, yeah.
[34:22.710 --> 34:28.550]  Personally, I prefer the distillers waste over the brewers waste because there are some
[34:28.550 --> 34:34.710]  antibacterial properties to the brewers waste that are not existent in distillers waste.
[34:34.710 --> 34:43.750]  But either way, it's a fantastic way to really create that diversity there or biocomplete
[34:43.750 --> 34:45.270]  compost that you're trying to achieve.
[34:45.910 --> 34:46.390]  For sure.
[34:46.390 --> 34:51.110]  I wonder about how much glyphosate would get through after the beer brewing process.
[34:51.350 --> 34:53.350]  You know, as opposed to distilling.
[34:53.350 --> 34:56.870]  I feel like distilling would make it, you know, pure.
[34:56.870 --> 35:00.150]  But I don't worry about that too much if you're putting it through the compost pile
[35:00.150 --> 35:01.510]  with a ton of diversity.
[35:01.510 --> 35:03.510]  You know, it's going to break down a lot of that stuff.
[35:03.510 --> 35:07.030]  And if you're aging it a long time, like don't worry too much about it.
[35:07.670 --> 35:12.790]  And, you know, here's here's a trick on dealing with glyphosate if you have an issue
[35:12.790 --> 35:13.290]  over it.
[35:14.550 --> 35:20.390]  There are plenty of bacteria out there that have gotten used to breaking this down.
[35:20.790 --> 35:23.510]  You know, this was unheard of.
[35:23.510 --> 35:29.430]  But at this point in time, if you can find a place where, you know, a farmer has been
[35:29.430 --> 35:33.830]  using a tremendous amount of Roundup and you still got these indicator plants, not going
[35:33.830 --> 35:34.630]  to form weeds.
[35:35.270 --> 35:39.430]  You can harvest those plants, harvest the root balls, bring them back, put them in your
[35:39.430 --> 35:40.550]  compost pile.
[35:40.550 --> 35:46.630]  They will grow out and they will attack and break down any glyphosate that you do have
[35:46.630 --> 35:47.030]  present.
[35:47.670 --> 35:48.170]  That's awesome.
[35:48.730 --> 35:50.490]  So do it.
[35:50.490 --> 35:51.130]  Do it yourself.
[35:51.690 --> 35:52.570]  That's a great idea.
[35:53.370 --> 35:58.010]  Also, we're using turkey tail mushrooms and black pearl oyster mushrooms.
[35:58.010 --> 36:01.370]  Those have both been shown to break down glyphosate, turn it into useful things.
[36:02.010 --> 36:02.410]  Yep.
[36:02.410 --> 36:03.210]  Yeah, absolutely.
[36:03.210 --> 36:10.410]  And as a matter of fact, mushrooms as a whole decomposers will break down atrazine.
[36:10.410 --> 36:11.210]  You name it.
[36:11.210 --> 36:17.850]  Any of these legacy pesticides that were used early back in the 60s, 70s, 80s.
[36:19.370 --> 36:22.010]  So again, you know, how do you get there?
[36:22.010 --> 36:30.650]  Well, you start by having a nice fungal decomposer, a saprobe to break it into secondary and tertiary
[36:30.650 --> 36:31.370]  metabolites.
[36:32.490 --> 36:35.690]  But even those second and tertiaries are dangerous.
[36:35.690 --> 36:37.050]  They're still toxic.
[36:37.050 --> 36:42.330]  But this is where compost comes in because the compost can then take those secondary
[36:42.330 --> 36:45.370]  and tertiary and make them completely go away.
[36:46.250 --> 36:50.730]  I've been working with a university called Furman on just this.
[36:51.770 --> 37:00.250]  Buddy of mine, Leif Olsen, was working with them using, I think it was oyster mushrooms
[37:01.050 --> 37:06.490]  to break down atrazine in a controlled environment.
[37:06.490 --> 37:10.010]  And they were successful at breaking the original compound, but they still had the
[37:10.010 --> 37:11.290]  secondary and tertiary.
[37:11.850 --> 37:17.690]  So he asked me to send them some product to see if this would work in breaking those secondary
[37:17.690 --> 37:18.410]  and tertiaries.
[37:18.410 --> 37:18.890]  And it did.
[37:19.450 --> 37:23.610]  So there's proof in the pudding that Mother Nature will break down no matter what the
[37:23.610 --> 37:25.690]  fuck we concoct.
[37:25.690 --> 37:26.730]  It might take time.
[37:28.490 --> 37:31.770]  We might not be around to see it like with some of these forever chemicals.
[37:31.770 --> 37:37.930]  But even still, if you start the process, you're way better off than if you just ignore
[37:37.930 --> 37:38.250]  it.
[37:38.250 --> 37:40.250]  So compost is king.
[37:40.250 --> 37:42.170]  I can't say that enough times.
[37:43.050 --> 37:44.410]  It's a miracle worker.
[37:44.410 --> 37:53.050]  And again, even if it's immature compost, I've told this story before about the Ventura
[37:53.050 --> 37:57.210]  County Compost Cup and how the judges all came in and they looked at the stuff.
[37:57.850 --> 37:59.370]  And they said, oh, well, this is the best.
[38:00.010 --> 38:02.410]  And I'm like, we don't have any data on that.
[38:03.050 --> 38:04.170]  And they're like, well, what do you mean?
[38:04.170 --> 38:09.770]  I go, I don't see any compost tests for any of these 18, 20 different samples that we
[38:09.770 --> 38:10.810]  have in front of us.
[38:10.810 --> 38:12.650]  You looked at it under a microscope.
[38:12.650 --> 38:14.970]  How can you tell me that it's good just by looking at it?
[38:14.970 --> 38:16.170]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, that's insane.
[38:16.170 --> 38:19.210]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, we as a species don't understand.
[38:19.210 --> 38:20.730]  Compost is a process.
[38:20.730 --> 38:22.650]  It's not an end result or a product.
[38:23.370 --> 38:28.010]  And so even in immature compost, it still has value.
[38:28.010 --> 38:33.130]  Like we're talking about those facultative anaerobes are still have incredible value,
[38:33.770 --> 38:37.930]  regardless of whether you're in aero or an anaerobe.
[38:37.930 --> 38:41.850]  In other words, if you're either way, one way or the other, the facultatives will get
[38:41.850 --> 38:47.050]  in there and do the heavy lifting and start spinning that in a direction you want.
[38:47.610 --> 38:51.130]  And you know, I love the concept of the yin yang, right?
[38:51.130 --> 38:52.170]  The black and the white.
[38:52.570 --> 38:57.690]  And we always try to look at things as right or wrong, black or white.
[38:58.250 --> 39:04.090]  I prefer to live in the gray line so that I'm not telling people that you're right
[39:04.090 --> 39:07.370]  or wrong because I think that's an inappropriate approach.
[39:07.930 --> 39:13.930]  I think it's better to understand and allow, you know, other people to think or believe
[39:13.930 --> 39:18.090]  or try different things based on what they've been exposed to.
[39:18.570 --> 39:22.330]  And not say, you know, oh, you know, soil food web's right.
[39:22.330 --> 39:25.530]  Biodiversity is bullshit or biodynamics is bullshit.
[39:25.530 --> 39:27.530]  No, all of these things have a place.
[39:27.530 --> 39:29.130]  They have a very important place.
[39:29.130 --> 39:35.450]  And it's just we as a culture try to pigeonhole shit instead of like open our minds to, you
[39:35.450 --> 39:37.610]  know, hey, is there other options?
[39:37.610 --> 39:39.050]  Are there other solutions?
[39:39.050 --> 39:43.290]  Because there's millions of different ways to skin a kitty.
[39:43.290 --> 39:44.330]  Never liked it, but.
[39:44.570 --> 39:53.610]  Chandler, you said turkey tail mushrooms and black oyster mushrooms are black pearl oysters,
[39:53.610 --> 39:54.730]  like pearls.
[39:54.730 --> 39:56.890]  Yeah, but there's there's got to be so many others.
[39:56.890 --> 40:00.250]  Those are just two that have been proven to tackle glyphosate.
[40:00.250 --> 40:04.810]  But mushrooms are turkey tails, a wonderful cancer fighter as well.
[40:04.810 --> 40:06.890]  You should be in all of our diets.
[40:07.450 --> 40:08.010]  Absolutely.
[40:09.210 --> 40:10.650]  Well, speaking on that, look at this.
[40:11.210 --> 40:12.250]  I started taking this.
[40:13.290 --> 40:13.790]  A.
[40:17.610 --> 40:18.650]  Is that the turkey tail there?
[40:19.610 --> 40:21.290]  It says mushroom medley.
[40:21.290 --> 40:21.850]  Oh, yeah.
[40:22.410 --> 40:26.010]  There's a eight different polypores in there from the old growth forest.
[40:27.770 --> 40:29.050]  I wanted to give you a shout out, man.
[40:29.050 --> 40:31.610]  This stuff is a I really enjoy it.
[40:31.610 --> 40:32.170]  Thank you.
[40:32.170 --> 40:32.650]  Thank you.
[40:33.850 --> 40:37.050]  And, you know, something else that you touched on Chandler was yeast.
[40:37.130 --> 40:41.850]  That was a big no, no with Elaine was, oh, my God, you brewed yeast.
[40:42.570 --> 40:48.570]  And it's like, yeah, but no, they're the precursor to sap robes.
[40:48.570 --> 40:50.090]  They got a hell of an appetite.
[40:50.090 --> 40:50.810]  Yeah, yeah.
[40:50.810 --> 40:52.410]  I just want to break stuff down.
[40:52.410 --> 40:58.810]  And if you get them in high densities, the sap robes are going to come in.
[40:58.810 --> 41:04.410]  So you're jump starting the whole ecology that usually takes place in the wild.
[41:04.410 --> 41:04.970]  Exactly.
[41:04.970 --> 41:10.170]  By applying some of these things that we've been told not to do.
[41:10.170 --> 41:17.690]  So, you know, I, again, don't ever claim something is wrong without you trying it first.
[41:17.690 --> 41:23.770]  And if you find that this is a problem, you learned a great lesson and then you can tell
[41:23.770 --> 41:25.850]  other people not to make that mistake.
[41:26.730 --> 41:31.930]  You know, but again, yeah, there's so much more to, you know, to do.
[41:32.250 --> 41:39.370]  Yeah, there's so much more to all of this than we have even begun to understand.
[41:39.370 --> 41:42.250]  I mean, we're so ignorant at this point.
[41:42.810 --> 41:47.370]  And that's like the greatest wisdom of all is like, you know, admitting that we don't
[41:47.370 --> 41:48.090]  really know shit.
[41:48.090 --> 41:49.530]  We're scratching the surface.
[41:49.530 --> 41:52.250]  And like, there is some really cool stuff that can help us out.
[41:52.250 --> 41:56.810]  But like to think that we're absolute and to be certain, it's just ridiculous to me.
[41:56.810 --> 42:00.250]  Like we're just figuring stuff out for sure.
[42:00.650 --> 42:06.490]  Yeah, those geobiochemical reactions are fucked up.
[42:08.010 --> 42:14.570]  And they're happening so fast in so many directions and so many levels that you have
[42:14.570 --> 42:19.290]  to sit there and say, oh, well, you know, this compost needs to sit for another 30 days.
[42:19.290 --> 42:20.170]  You're crazy.
[42:20.170 --> 42:20.970]  You're fucking crazy.
[42:22.650 --> 42:25.690]  So anyway, Alexa, you want to pop in here on any of this?
[42:25.930 --> 42:26.430]  Sure.
[42:27.130 --> 42:35.610]  So you had brought up the Ventura County compost cup and, you know, the way that they
[42:37.290 --> 42:43.930]  went about testing the compost and determining what was a high quality compost.
[42:43.930 --> 42:50.010]  And that's something that, you know, Chandler and I have been discussing a lot lately with
[42:50.010 --> 42:53.050]  our, with the composting community.
[42:53.610 --> 42:57.530]  With our, with the compost, Michigan compost cup.
[42:58.250 --> 43:04.490]  And how do we determine a high quality compost?
[43:04.490 --> 43:06.410]  Like how, you know, would we go about this?
[43:06.410 --> 43:12.730]  So that's kind of why we're not doing the competition part of it this year is because,
[43:13.930 --> 43:19.130]  you know, there's so many levels to what makes a good compost that like you said, we can't
[43:19.130 --> 43:26.410]  just look at the biology and determine whether, you know, it's going to, you know, be a high
[43:26.410 --> 43:27.690]  quality compost or not.
[43:27.690 --> 43:36.090]  And just there's so many, you know, like you said, there's the anaerobic compost, there's
[43:36.090 --> 43:38.810]  facultative, you know, there's aerobic.
[43:39.610 --> 43:45.370]  So it's just really hard to determine from just looking at the microscope.
[43:45.370 --> 43:51.770]  And, you know, we also want to look at like the chemistry of it, because that's something
[43:51.770 --> 43:58.810]  that I've been getting into lately as well is, you know, using compost as like a fertilizer
[43:58.810 --> 44:06.090]  because it does have a large like chemical component to it.
[44:06.090 --> 44:13.290]  So there's, you know, lots of NPK and minerals and nutrients in the compost as well.
[44:13.930 --> 44:19.610]  Not just an inoculant of microbiology, but also as like a fertilizer.
[44:19.610 --> 44:26.730]  So there are many different ways that compost can be beneficial.
[44:26.730 --> 44:34.730]  So without actually seeing how the plant reacts to the compost, it's really hard to make that
[44:35.290 --> 44:36.410]  determination.
[44:37.930 --> 44:42.090]  Yeah, so I don't know if you guys noticed, but we added quotations to the cup.
[44:42.410 --> 44:43.530]  The compost cup.
[44:45.210 --> 44:47.050]  You know, it's just, we're going to have fun.
[44:47.050 --> 44:50.890]  We're going to bring compost that you're proud of, and we can look at it under the microscope.
[44:50.890 --> 44:55.610]  But, you know, we're not going to give somebody a first place trophy or anything like that.
[44:55.610 --> 44:57.130]  That just seems a little bit silly.
[44:57.130 --> 45:02.730]  But it's just going to be more than anything, a celebration of soil and life and just like
[45:02.730 --> 45:07.210]  bringing all these cool people that are into the same cool stuff that we are together and
[45:07.210 --> 45:11.850]  just having a wonderful time talking about all these cool practices that we can do and
[45:12.170 --> 45:18.730]  sharing the fruit of our labor, the best ganja, best food and ferments and stuff and connecting
[45:18.730 --> 45:19.530]  a lot of these dots.
[45:19.530 --> 45:24.650]  Because, you know, as you get into this and it becomes your lifestyle, what you do in
[45:24.650 --> 45:28.650]  the kitchen and what you do in the garden play in really, really well together.
[45:28.650 --> 45:34.330]  And like you can create some wonderful, you know, products to feed to your garden off
[45:34.330 --> 45:37.690]  of your byproducts from, you know, cooking your food.
[45:37.770 --> 45:42.570]  And, you know, even if you're just rinsing your potatoes, that dirt on that water is
[45:42.570 --> 45:45.610]  going to be more valuable than just water by itself.
[45:45.610 --> 45:50.570]  You know, and so if you let that sit out and, you know, culture those microbes that were
[45:50.570 --> 45:56.650]  on that field and same thing with rice and anything that we're rinsing and just utilizing
[45:56.650 --> 46:00.410]  all that rinse water and sprout water.
[46:00.410 --> 46:06.250]  And so like if we're eating any seeds or grains, really, we should be sprouting them first.
[46:06.250 --> 46:09.930]  They're not really easy for us to digest unless they are sprouted.
[46:09.930 --> 46:13.770]  And so like when you sprout them, you use that sprout water with all those enzymes and
[46:13.770 --> 46:19.050]  everything and boom, you're feeding your garden for free, literally the byproducts that you're
[46:19.050 --> 46:19.770]  eating.
[46:19.770 --> 46:22.810]  And I drink a lot of loose leaf tea.
[46:23.370 --> 46:25.770]  And so, you know, you're drinking these teas.
[46:25.770 --> 46:31.610]  A lot of them are like biodynamic accumulators, really, really healthy herbs, adaptogenic
[46:31.610 --> 46:32.490]  herbs.
[46:32.490 --> 46:37.850]  And then once you do pour two pours of water over these herbs, then you put them in a bowl,
[46:37.850 --> 46:41.690]  fill it up with water and let it sit for a couple of days and they all start bubbling.
[46:41.690 --> 46:45.450]  And like then you feed that to your garden, to your compost pile and boom, you're just
[46:45.450 --> 46:49.690]  using stuff that normally you'd compost or you'd throw out or whatever.
[46:49.690 --> 46:54.730]  And you're making it more bioavailable because you're cycling it through the biology.
[46:54.730 --> 46:57.370]  And like, I don't know, it's pretty cool stuff.
[46:57.770 --> 47:03.610]  You know, I got to say that you guys are probably spot on about testing.
[47:03.610 --> 47:12.330]  So there are a lot of companies out there that will accept compost, you know, like Logan
[47:12.330 --> 47:18.970]  Labs and some of these other soil chemistry places, but they're not suited to really
[47:18.970 --> 47:21.450]  examine compost the way it should be.
[47:22.010 --> 47:24.490]  So there's a company called Woods End up in Maine.
[47:24.570 --> 47:25.290]  They're very expensive.
[47:25.290 --> 47:28.010]  It's like $750 for a test.
[47:28.010 --> 47:34.010]  But the way they break out the information and pull it into different pockets allows
[47:34.010 --> 47:41.930]  you to really look at some of the more important attributes of the compost along with the chemistry.
[47:41.930 --> 47:44.810]  And Alexa, you're spot on.
[47:44.810 --> 47:52.010]  I mean, there is an incredible value to compost as a fertilizer because it's a very, very
[47:52.090 --> 47:54.330]  easy to break down.
[47:54.330 --> 48:00.890]  It's so easily broken down by the organisms and released to other organisms and again,
[48:00.890 --> 48:05.130]  released back to the plant as those bacteria get consumed by protozoa.
[48:05.130 --> 48:07.050]  So it's incredibly powerful tool.
[48:08.490 --> 48:16.410]  And something else that since we're talking about like how to talk about compost, finally,
[48:17.930 --> 48:19.610]  there's a trend out there now.
[48:20.570 --> 48:27.050]  We are we are calling compost either we've created a scale.
[48:27.050 --> 48:31.450]  So there's POM, P-O-M, particulate organic matter.
[48:32.010 --> 48:37.290]  And then on the other end of the spectrum is called MOM, mineral associated organic
[48:37.290 --> 48:37.610]  matter.
[48:38.330 --> 48:41.530]  Mineral associated organic matter is essentially silt.
[48:42.330 --> 48:48.970]  It'll last a couple of years, three years in your soil where POM will only last a couple
[48:49.050 --> 48:49.530]  of months.
[48:50.170 --> 48:56.970]  So highly unstable POM is but very good at fertilizing where the opposite is true of
[48:56.970 --> 48:57.370]  MOM.
[48:57.370 --> 49:01.050]  MOM is a long term food source.
[49:01.050 --> 49:06.970]  So like think of it as a slow release, fast release fertilizer, but very important nonetheless
[49:06.970 --> 49:09.610]  because that's helping to build those aggregates.
[49:10.250 --> 49:17.290]  So in that essence, we now have the ability to create a line scale of like, all right,
[49:17.290 --> 49:20.090]  what is where where is your compost?
[49:20.090 --> 49:29.530]  And that may be the best approach to putting a value on compost is by taking it to another
[49:29.530 --> 49:34.330]  level and using a different scale, a different tool to analyze it.
[49:34.330 --> 49:40.890]  Because what the compost cup does is brings awareness that compost isn't stinky.
[49:40.890 --> 49:43.210]  It can be, but it's not all stinky.
[49:44.170 --> 49:48.650]  And there's a big difference between vermicompost and regular compost.
[49:48.650 --> 49:50.970]  And then you've got plant based compost.
[49:50.970 --> 49:52.970]  You've got manure based compost.
[49:52.970 --> 50:00.410]  There's so many different varieties or methods to breaking down organic material and making
[50:00.410 --> 50:05.610]  it into something that does support both biological as well as plant health.
[50:06.410 --> 50:12.570]  So maybe that's the approach because I'll be honest with you at the Ventura Compost
[50:12.570 --> 50:18.810]  Cup, I microscope every fucking sample three days, three days behind a microscope.
[50:18.810 --> 50:21.210]  You talk about sore fucking neck, man.
[50:21.210 --> 50:21.610]  I bet.
[50:23.370 --> 50:29.210]  And I did eliminate some of the ones that were just so putrid that it was like, I didn't
[50:29.210 --> 50:34.170]  even want people to be exposed to it because you never know if you're immunocompromised,
[50:34.170 --> 50:37.290]  you can get sick playing around with some of these really bad animals.
[50:38.090 --> 50:44.570]  And then the ones that I determined had the highest value, none of them, none of them
[50:44.570 --> 50:48.890]  got even into the judges considerations.
[50:48.890 --> 50:52.490]  And so because they were looking at texture, they were looking at the color.
[50:52.490 --> 50:52.890]  And it's like-
[50:52.890 --> 50:53.930]  That is insane.
[50:53.930 --> 50:55.610]  Yeah, the color doesn't fucking matter.
[50:55.610 --> 50:57.290]  The texture has no matter.
[50:57.290 --> 50:58.650]  It doesn't matter.
[50:58.650 --> 51:04.970]  And I brought them out to my compost that is like incredibly biologically rich and incredibly
[51:05.050 --> 51:07.610]  diverse as far as nutrients are concerned.
[51:07.610 --> 51:08.170]  Hey, buddy.
[51:08.810 --> 51:10.970]  And I held it up and they're like, oh, that's ugly.
[51:10.970 --> 51:11.930]  That's not compost.
[51:11.930 --> 51:14.250]  I'm like, you have no idea.
[51:16.650 --> 51:25.370]  So again, bringing awareness to people that, I know, I'll give you attention later, that
[51:25.370 --> 51:32.970]  there are all kinds of varieties of and what we want to call timelines for compost.
[51:33.530 --> 51:36.890]  That that should be perhaps the approach.
[51:37.930 --> 51:45.290]  One of the guys that entered a sample in it was the first time I've ever seen true moan.
[51:46.890 --> 51:52.170]  He takes two years to make his biodynamic compost and it's silk.
[51:53.610 --> 51:54.330]  It's silky.
[51:54.970 --> 51:56.330]  And there's no particulate.
[51:56.330 --> 51:57.450]  There's nothing left of it.
[51:58.010 --> 52:00.410]  And so I brought that to the attention of the judges.
[52:00.410 --> 52:02.250]  I'm like, hey, you guys look at this.
[52:02.250 --> 52:02.810]  Feel it.
[52:02.810 --> 52:04.170]  Rub it between your fingers.
[52:04.170 --> 52:05.210]  Don't just look at it.
[52:05.770 --> 52:08.410]  And then do that with some of these other compost.
[52:08.410 --> 52:14.890]  And again, the greasier it is, the more biologically adverse it is.
[52:14.890 --> 52:19.930]  And usually, typically with like a moan, it's going to be bacterial dominant because you
[52:19.930 --> 52:26.170]  just don't have the pore space for the protozoa to do their work so that they can't survive
[52:26.170 --> 52:26.970]  in that.
[52:26.970 --> 52:30.730]  And the opposite is true on, you know, in poem.
[52:31.370 --> 52:37.370]  Home, you're not going to get the high diversity or level of bacterial communities that you
[52:37.370 --> 52:38.570]  would in the moan.
[52:38.570 --> 52:43.290]  So here again, these are other ways to kind of steer the way we measure or look at it.
[52:43.290 --> 52:48.410]  But the most important thing is to just make people aware that this is something that's
[52:48.410 --> 52:49.370]  so easy to do.
[52:50.090 --> 52:52.570]  And it's crazy that we don't all do it.
[52:54.010 --> 52:58.730]  You know, I shake my head every time I see the garbage man come out here and pick up
[52:58.730 --> 53:04.810]  these green bins stuffed to the fucking brim with all this amazing organic matter.
[53:05.770 --> 53:12.250]  And that our government doesn't force landscapers to recycle everything on the property that
[53:12.250 --> 53:14.090]  it was being cut from.
[53:14.090 --> 53:19.450]  I mean, you're just sorry, shipping the fertility off your property.
[53:19.450 --> 53:24.810]  Literally, you're fucking somebody to fuck you over.
[53:24.810 --> 53:26.730]  Like, it's ridiculous.
[53:26.730 --> 53:32.410]  Yeah, and then pump charge you to take it away, charge you to fertilize and charge you
[53:32.410 --> 53:33.450]  to spray Roundup.
[53:35.450 --> 53:36.250]  You've been duped.
[53:37.130 --> 53:38.810]  The insanity of humanity.
[53:44.330 --> 53:48.890]  So with the level of knowledge that you have Chandler and Alexa, if you want to chime in
[53:48.890 --> 53:54.170]  with some of this stuff, I personally would like to know more from your standpoint of,
[53:54.170 --> 53:59.050]  you know, defining biofilm with using worms of vermiculture.
[53:59.050 --> 54:03.130]  I was just wondering if you could talk more about that, because when I first got into
[54:03.130 --> 54:08.490]  farming cannabis, going from, you know, the synthetic world into this, we just started
[54:08.490 --> 54:09.610]  using castings, right?
[54:09.610 --> 54:11.450]  And it's like, wow, this is amazing.
[54:11.450 --> 54:16.330]  Then when you actually put those little machines into that soil system, it is a night and day
[54:16.330 --> 54:16.730]  difference.
[54:16.730 --> 54:18.650]  So I kind of wanted to talk about that for a minute.
[54:18.650 --> 54:19.610]  Yeah, for sure.
[54:19.610 --> 54:22.970]  So if you've ever picked up a worm, you got that slime on you.
[54:24.010 --> 54:26.650]  They're actually secreting eggs and sperm.
[54:26.650 --> 54:27.930]  So they're hermaphroditic.
[54:27.930 --> 54:32.330]  And so some worms are actually capable of like self cloning and they just need one worm
[54:32.330 --> 54:33.050]  to do it.
[54:33.050 --> 54:37.770]  But a lot of them will have like these huge orgies, which you'll see if you ever do like
[54:37.770 --> 54:43.370]  the avocado tuck or put any organic matter on your soil, they'll come up and form a ball
[54:43.370 --> 54:46.410]  and they're all just rubbing against each other and creating those cocoons.
[54:46.410 --> 54:51.770]  But that biofilm, that slime on them has other purposes as well.
[54:51.770 --> 54:54.170]  And you'll even see this with like slugs.
[54:54.170 --> 54:59.290]  It's like there's everything's got value, but like that slime that they leave behind
[54:59.290 --> 55:02.890]  is what binds these soil particles together and creates aggregates and stuff.
[55:02.890 --> 55:08.410]  But when these worms are tunneling through the soil, they're making these burrows, these
[55:08.410 --> 55:12.410]  tunnels and that slime, especially in some species over than others.
[55:12.410 --> 55:18.810]  But like night crawlers will have long, straight down channels that that slime kind of like
[55:18.810 --> 55:24.730]  solidifies the tunnel and creates a mine shaft for dissolved oxygen like you talk about.
[55:24.730 --> 55:28.810]  But also they're taking organic matter from the top and bringing it down.
[55:28.810 --> 55:30.810]  They're pooping it out in those mine shafts.
[55:30.810 --> 55:34.890]  They're leaving some partially undigested organic matter and that's bringing in all
[55:34.890 --> 55:36.410]  these other microbes and everything.
[55:36.410 --> 55:42.810]  And so like they're creating these mine shafts that are perfect for the roots to tap into
[55:42.810 --> 55:46.730]  because these roots are looking for the path of least resistance.
[55:46.730 --> 55:53.050]  And so these worms literally tunnel perfect little channels for the roots and fill them
[55:53.050 --> 55:55.530]  in with all the organic goodies that they need.
[55:55.530 --> 56:01.130]  But also those tunnels allow water to come in and infiltrate.
[56:01.130 --> 56:06.730]  And as Leighton was talking about, so much of soil is airspace, which a lot of people
[56:06.730 --> 56:07.770]  don't think about.
[56:07.770 --> 56:13.290]  And so like every time it rains, it pushes down all that stagnant air that was down there
[56:13.290 --> 56:14.650]  and flushes it out.
[56:14.650 --> 56:19.130]  And the worms really help out with that.
[56:19.130 --> 56:24.010]  And so like obviously we don't want highly compacted soils.
[56:24.010 --> 56:29.530]  And so employing worms to create all these tunnels and everything is a huge help for us.
[56:29.530 --> 56:31.130]  They're doing it 24-7.
[56:31.130 --> 56:35.690]  They're tilling our soil, aerating it, you know, without tilling it and without disturbing
[56:35.690 --> 56:36.190]  it.
[56:39.060 --> 56:39.560]  Alexa?
[56:43.370 --> 56:46.010]  Oh, I think Chandler summed that one up perfectly.
[56:46.010 --> 56:47.770]  Maybe Leighton's got something.
[56:47.770 --> 56:49.530]  What?
[56:49.530 --> 56:51.290]  Maybe Leighton's got something on that.
[56:51.290 --> 56:54.650]  Something else I like about the worms real quick is that they're, yeah, they're digging
[56:54.650 --> 56:59.370]  all these channels, but it seems like most of the microfauna kind of hitch a ride on
[56:59.370 --> 56:59.930]  them.
[56:59.930 --> 57:04.570]  So you're able to not only use those worms to build up everything, but you're also using
[57:04.570 --> 57:10.570]  them to create and build a better network in a much shorter time than anything else
[57:10.570 --> 57:11.530]  I've ever seen.
[57:11.530 --> 57:12.010]  Definitely.
[57:12.010 --> 57:16.410]  They're all hitching a ride on that slime on them and they're all getting dispersed
[57:16.410 --> 57:17.130]  throughout the soil.
[57:17.130 --> 57:20.810]  And so like that's what's really cool about something like the avocado tech, or you can
[57:20.810 --> 57:26.570]  use melons or pumpkins, even just a wet piece of cardboard, is you can add your amendments
[57:26.570 --> 57:31.210]  and you can add maybe even an inoculant and those worms are going to eat it, but also
[57:31.210 --> 57:36.970]  they're just going to get it on their skin, on that slime, and then they take it everywhere
[57:36.970 --> 57:37.530]  with them.
[57:37.530 --> 57:40.250]  And so they're transportation machines.
[57:40.250 --> 57:42.410]  Yeah, I consider them public transportation.
[57:44.010 --> 57:46.410]  They do a wonderful job at distributing everything.
[57:46.410 --> 57:47.130]  For sure.
[57:48.730 --> 57:52.810]  You know, the different elements that we're looking to get around as well as the biology,
[57:52.810 --> 57:53.610]  the diversity.
[57:54.570 --> 58:01.690]  Yeah, and on a similar topic that biofilm has traditionally been looked at as like,
[58:01.690 --> 58:05.850]  ew, you got to use Clorox, you got to kill it, kill it.
[58:05.850 --> 58:07.370]  Biofilm is the key to life.
[58:08.010 --> 58:11.290]  There would be no life on this planet without biofilm.
[58:12.410 --> 58:15.290]  And that's what holds aggregates together.
[58:15.290 --> 58:22.490]  And so these worms and their biofilm are just as critical as the bacteria because the bacteria
[58:22.490 --> 58:27.930]  take longer to build these aggregates than the worms do that are moving through it and
[58:27.930 --> 58:33.050]  leaving huge amounts of this biofilm that can then start those aggregates.
[58:33.050 --> 58:38.730]  So yeah, that's why you see the difference, Brian, between worm castings and actually
[58:38.730 --> 58:43.930]  having the guys in the planter or in the bed doing the work for you.
[58:44.490 --> 58:44.810]  For sure.
[58:45.370 --> 58:46.410]  And you get free castings.
[58:47.770 --> 58:48.570]  That's what I'm saying.
[58:48.570 --> 58:52.090]  Why wouldn't you buy the machines if it's so fantastic, then why wouldn't you want the
[58:52.250 --> 58:54.170]  machines working in the soil for you?
[58:54.170 --> 58:59.370]  And then taking it to the next level, I think using a diverse group of worms like Chandler
[58:59.370 --> 59:04.010]  was mentioning, the night crawlers, the red wigglers, the Georgia Alabama jumpers.
[59:04.010 --> 59:10.490]  I think that's kind of the four horsemen, if you will, of the soil system that I've
[59:10.490 --> 59:11.130]  been able to use.
[59:11.130 --> 59:16.410]  And as long as the, you know, that if you're using a raised bed, that's big enough, or
[59:16.410 --> 59:22.330]  you're using like a 30 gallon air pot, fabric pot, I think that that's big enough so that
[59:22.330 --> 59:24.330]  you don't have real competition.
[59:24.330 --> 59:29.290]  I've never really noticed, you know, the worms have any really competition because the ones
[59:29.290 --> 59:31.690]  that we mentioned are on different levels.
[59:31.690 --> 59:35.370]  You know, the red wigglers are going to work the top, night crawlers are kind of working
[59:35.370 --> 59:39.530]  everything in between, and then the Alabama Georgia jumpers are staying at the bottom.
[59:39.530 --> 59:42.410]  So there really shouldn't be a reason.
[59:42.410 --> 59:46.170]  I know that, you know, a couple of years ago, people were saying, oh, then one worm is going
[59:46.170 --> 59:47.130]  to out-compete the other.
[59:48.010 --> 59:51.450]  I personally never used anything lower than 25 gallon.
[59:51.450 --> 59:56.090]  I think, again, 30 gallon is the best for one person because you can still move that
[59:56.090 --> 59:56.970]  yourself.
[59:56.970 --> 01:00:00.490]  But if you have big beds or something like that, I really wouldn't necessarily worry
[01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:02.330]  about, I would get creative with that stuff.
[01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:06.010]  Are there any other worms out there that you guys would recommend other than those four?
[01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:12.250]  No, and I talked a bit about this on shaping fire the other day, but especially up in like
[01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:16.970]  the northern part of the continent, there's some areas that are still earthworm free.
[01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:22.730]  And so like after the last ice age, all those glaciers wiped out earthworms in northern
[01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:23.610]  North America.
[01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:27.770]  And so like they've been reintroduced by European settlers, but there's still some
[01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:31.050]  old growth forest and some areas that are earthworm free.
[01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:35.530]  And if you go and like reintroduce these outdoors, they can actually be kind of detrimental and
[01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:41.770]  invasive, and especially in like a native environment that's not for food production.
[01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:45.930]  So like basically all the things that we love about them in the garden, if they were out
[01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:51.450]  in the forest, they could be detrimental and clear out all that organic soil duff.
[01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:55.690]  And they're like the beavers of the soil.
[01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:58.330]  And so like they're ecosystem engineers.
[01:00:58.330 --> 01:01:03.930]  And so like they'll totally change the physical composition as well as the chemical composition
[01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:04.890]  of your soil.
[01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:09.930]  And so if you're just indoors and everything, it's way, way less to worry about, but it's
[01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:11.130]  always something to consider.
[01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:17.210]  And especially a lot of those jumper species have been kind of like some of the most invasive
[01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:18.090]  up here.
[01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:20.650]  And so that's a great point.
[01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:22.010]  This is for indoor farming.
[01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.730]  Yes.
[01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:28.090]  Trying to replicate old growth forest as best you can with a basement.
[01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:30.410]  For sure.
[01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:34.650]  But yeah, those four are pretty good for indoors.
[01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:40.730]  I personally just use European night crawlers and red wigglers, but biodiversity seems to
[01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.170]  be the way to go.
[01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:45.610]  So if you've been having success with that, then you probably know a little bit more about
[01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:46.250]  those other two.
[01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:52.330]  Yeah, I seriously warn people about those jumpers.
[01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:56.810]  Or they used to be called crazy snake worms because they act like a snake.
[01:01:57.770 --> 01:02:01.770]  And I've personally witnessed them devastate a forest in Connecticut.
[01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:03.610]  I was out there with Efrem.
[01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:07.610]  We were doing mushroom scouting and looking for truffles.
[01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:11.770]  And basically the whole duff was gone.
[01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.290]  It was just rice krispies.
[01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:16.170]  And I haven't been back there since.
[01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:19.370]  I will be heading over there in the summer.
[01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:25.130]  And I'm planning to stop by and see how the ecology has taken hold because we couldn't
[01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:26.490]  find any hyphae.
[01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:27.850]  We couldn't find any mushrooms.
[01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:29.370]  We couldn't find any truffles.
[01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:31.930]  The area was just devastated with this.
[01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:41.450]  And literally five years later, a good friend of mine, Cynthia Rubinowitz, who's a very
[01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:50.410]  well-renowned soil scientist, does a lot of work for state and individual towns in documenting
[01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:53.610]  wetlands and plant species and diversity.
[01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:58.090]  She actually called me because they got into her garden and destroyed everything.
[01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:01.290]  Please don't release those in the wild.
[01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:04.010]  It's just not a good thing.
[01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:05.210]  And I'm not one to tell you.
[01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:06.250]  And those are expensive.
[01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:08.250]  So if you're releasing those in the wild, just call me.
[01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:13.530]  I'll come get them because those are not cheap at all.
[01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:16.570]  You're getting probably $100 for probably $50.
[01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:18.410]  For sure.
[01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:20.490]  And a lot of times it's not intentional things.
[01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:21.690]  People aren't thinking about it.
[01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:24.010]  But they have a worm bin that's been sitting for a while.
[01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:26.330]  They're done with it.
[01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:28.970]  They try to put some out in their outdoor garden.
[01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:35.770]  But a lot of the invasiveness comes from the fishing industry and going out to exotic locations
[01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:41.050]  and leaving your bait worms in an area that has never seen worms in tens of thousands of years.
[01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:45.450]  I tease Ken about that because the bait worm is the Canadian nightcrawler.
[01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:48.970]  And that's the only one I've ever had no success with.
[01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:52.890]  It's because they always want to come to the top and then they go out of the pot for whatever
[01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:56.090]  reason, where the European and the Africans don't do that.
[01:03:56.730 --> 01:03:58.010]  I didn't even know you were here, buddy.
[01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:04.650]  Hey, guys, I've been sitting in the background just watching.
[01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:05.930]  And I love you guys.
[01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:07.610]  You're talking my language.
[01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:10.730]  It's all about the biology, baby.
[01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:11.290]  Absolutely.
[01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:14.490]  And I'll jump back off.
[01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:15.770]  You're going to get your t-shirt.
[01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:16.810]  It says that, brother.
[01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:19.210]  Well, and that's a good point.
[01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:20.810]  You would never want to use a bait worm.
[01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:26.010]  So if you see the word nightcrawler, usually at a bait shop, it's going to be a Canadian
[01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:26.810]  nightcrawler.
[01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:32.170]  And that's going to be more headache than it is beneficial for sure, especially in a
[01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:32.890]  basement grow.
[01:04:32.890 --> 01:04:34.090]  They're going to be all over.
[01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:35.770]  They're going to be over the walls and everything.
[01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:42.570]  Yeah, or the African nightcrawlers, especially.
[01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:44.730]  I think those are well worth the money.
[01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:46.250]  And the red wigglers as well.
[01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:51.530]  I know the Colorado Worm Company, they only were using African nightcrawlers because they
[01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:55.690]  thought it was a nice hybrid for a little bit bigger.
[01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:58.410]  But didn't take forever to breed like some of the others.
[01:04:58.410 --> 01:04:58.730]  Nice.
[01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:04.490]  Ken is always lurking.
[01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:08.010]  Appreciate it.
[01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:16.090]  I'm here to learn as much as to give, guys, because you guys are teaching me stuff I didn't
[01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:18.250]  understand like the EM1 earlier.
[01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:20.410]  The gold nuggets.
[01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:23.130]  I mean, my God, you guys, if you didn't write that.
[01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:24.810]  Yeah, that needs to be timestamped.
[01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:25.610]  That is.
[01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:30.090]  That was like when Bird was talking about his temple balls, you know, guys winning
[01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:33.130]  compact Emerald Cup after Emerald Cup.
[01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:34.570]  And then he's telling you how he's doing it.
[01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:38.490]  And that's, yeah, there's just certain things since we've been doing this show late and that
[01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:43.610]  are unforgettable moments and definitely teaching everybody how to make their own EM1 was one
[01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:44.570]  of those challenges.
[01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:47.610]  So Green's Goddess did timestamp it for us.
[01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:53.130]  It's at 29 to 31 minutes into the show.
[01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:54.250]  So 31.
[01:05:56.090 --> 01:05:56.570]  Awesome.
[01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:58.410]  I'll make a post about that soon.
[01:05:58.410 --> 01:06:04.250]  Matt Powers book Regenerative Soil has a beautiful section with great charts on all that stuff.
[01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:06.570]  And the prep is from Quattamocfia.
[01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:09.610]  But Matt Powers included that in his book.
[01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:12.730]  And I'll take some pictures of that and post it on my Instagram soon.
[01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:15.610]  Yeah, Matt Powers, that guy's a G if you've never heard of him.
[01:06:15.610 --> 01:06:16.410]  Absolutely.
[01:06:16.410 --> 01:06:16.970]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:21.450]  I wanted to say you guys should reach out Bokashi for you to Quattamocfia.
[01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:23.930]  He'd be another absolutely great guest on the show.
[01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:27.370]  He's got so much wisdom to offer.
[01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:30.090]  And for whatever reason, he's just flying under the radar.
[01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:32.490]  So that's a I can send you his at later.
[01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:35.850]  Yeah, I might need your help with some of that.
[01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:39.050]  Because sometimes when I reach out to people, I'm like, Hey, I got this podcast.
[01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:41.050]  I don't have my 303 account anymore.
[01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:42.170]  So it's just rubber duckies.
[01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:45.130]  So I think some of those individuals are like, what, dude, what the fuck?
[01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:45.770]  You know, for sure.
[01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:46.810]  Rubber duckies.
[01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:48.010]  Duckies.
[01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:49.770]  I'm not talking about candidates like this guy.
[01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:53.050]  No, I'll hit him up and see if he's interested anyway.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:02.160]  Hey, so do you guys want to kind of, you know, for individuals that aren't on Instagram and stuff,
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:05.520]  you kind of want to talk about when your cups going to be in that so that we can at least
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.480]  promote that a little bit more?
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.120]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:10.160]  September 9th through 11th this year.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.240]  Under the full moon.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.400]  Your cup just changed.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.040]  It was trippy.
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.200]  But yeah, it's just going to be a great time.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.360]  Two and a half days, two nights of camping.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.800]  Our info is on Instagram.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:28.080]  But we should probably figure out a website or something pretty soon here.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.640]  And so what were those dates again?
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.560]  September 9th through 11th.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:33.840]  Okay.
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.080]  And we are accepting sponsorship.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:39.440]  And even if you can't make it out there, sponsorship money is going to go towards
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.600]  getting a videographer to record everything and everything.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.000]  I don't want to miss speak for Peter, but I think he and I already agreed to sponsor
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:48.400]  you guys.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.240]  So whenever you guys want to send that.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:50.960]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:53.040]  PayPal is probably the best for that kind of stuff.
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:53.440]  Perfect.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:59.600]  And I'll actually be driving cross country at that point in time.
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.520]  So maybe I'll swing up there.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.240]  No shit, man.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.080]  That'd be a dream come true for sure.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.000]  That'd be awesome.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:07.840]  All right.
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.600]  I'll definitely keep that in mind for sure.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.160]  Hell yeah, man.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.320]  We'll take care of you.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.480]  A lot of blood samples up here for sure.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:17.520]  Awesome.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.160]  Thank you.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.200]  That was actually something I was talking about to Alexa last week.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:25.840]  There's a lot of bright minds, a lot of very talented individuals that are moving
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.680]  to your state and it's really starting to take off.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.440]  I was mentioning a guy that I've always admired, Landis Stank.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.120]  He's moved out that way.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.440]  He stopped by over a couple of times.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:38.240]  Yeah.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:41.120]  And I think it's just another individual that I like to see.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.240]  He's self-taught.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.200]  To me, he's a young, young, young individual with that skill set.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.000]  That's the whole point of this show, at least from my side of things, is that
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:55.520]  more and more individuals feel like they have the confidence to try to become an A-Z complete
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.240]  farmer.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.920]  And when they do that, I feel like that really starts to show in their work.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:05.440]  And it seems like that there's more and more individuals that are A-Z farmers in your state
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.560]  or people are willing to go to that state and share the knowledge.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:12.480]  And it's just the talent is surely starting to rise.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.880]  And I just wanted to let individuals know that even in Colorado and some of these other
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.520]  states that I felt like first kicked it off, we're behind on some of those things for some
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.120]  of the younger individuals.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:27.280]  I mean, your state is, I would consider it more of the forefront than Colorado.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:28.560]  Hell yeah.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:29.120]  Thanks, man.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.440]  Definitely feel the momentum going.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:32.800]  We have a wonderful community.
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.400]  Alexa, you want to?
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:35.440]  Yeah.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:40.400]  No, just like huge shout out to everyone in the Michigan Regenerative community.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.520]  Like, wow.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.120]  I just love every single one of you so much.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:54.800]  Like, just have learned so much from all the amazing people and all their different experiences
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.240]  that they bring to the table.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:05.440]  And yeah, we just love getting everyone together for the compost cup and that being a great
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.280]  community building event.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.920]  So yeah, that's it.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.400]  Yeah.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:17.120]  Well, hopefully when Peter gets back or whatever, maybe we could set it up where you guys even
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:22.080]  were able, since you are raising a little bit of money, you could broadcast that or
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:22.640]  something.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.680]  That'd be really cool to see because there's so much information out there and sometimes
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:28.560]  it's not recorded.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.200]  And that's one of the cool things I like about Peter is he's not like, this is my platform.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.080]  This is the way that, it's just, hey, if you got an idea, let's throw it up there.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:38.960]  See if people like it.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.120]  If that resonates, hey, let's run with it.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:46.000]  And I definitely think that you guys are at the forefront in your state of not only teaching
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.920]  people how to farm in general, but just understanding that cannabis should be used as a medicinal
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:52.640]  aspect.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:56.240]  And to achieve that, it has to go a lot further than just NPK.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:02.080]  And as you go further East, even some of my friends still, they still farm that way.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:06.720]  I mean, they're still, they're NPK individuals because I don't necessarily think people in
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.000]  Georgia know this stuff yet.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:08.960]  Yep.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:13.360]  You can't get full spectrum medicine without full spectrum soil or bio complete soil.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.360]  You know, like the microbes are where it's at.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:26.000]  You know, when we first started talking about cannabinoid production and, and, you know,
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.280]  I want to call them the miners.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.720]  People were like, yeah, you're full of shit.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.720]  Living soils don't fucking do that.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:37.840]  And now here we are eight years later and the proof is in pudding.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:43.200]  The carbon rings, like these terpenes and cannabinoids come from carbon.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:50.000]  Of course, we need to be using carbon based fertilizers and microbes and like, yeah, it
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:50.560]  makes sense.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:51.920]  Yeah.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.640]  And I agree with Brian that Michigan's really doing some wonderful work up there.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:06.080]  And, and, you know, it comes across to when you share and people taste it and they experience
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:10.480]  the potential of the work that you guys have done.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.240]  It's undeniable.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.280]  It's fucking undeniable.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.320]  You know, Maine's another blossoming area.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.280]  California got crushed.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.120]  I mean, they just got fucking crushed.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:22.880]  It's so sad.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.800]  And I don't believe that, you know, Michigan and Maine, some of these other states are
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.880]  going to do what California did to its, its little farmers.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:38.800]  So, you know, again, location, location, location, and you guys definitely have one of the
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:46.400]  premier locations, both geographically, as well as, you know, weather wise, mineral soils,
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:51.840]  you know, you're, you've got the potential to just actually crush the market.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.120]  So keep up the good work.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.200]  Thank you.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.400]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.560]  Uh, don't we know a band over in Chicago?
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:07.280]  Maybe we could send the band over to their event and then do a live stream on that too,
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:07.920]  man.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:08.560]  Why not?
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:08.800]  Right?
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.080]  Hell yeah.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.640]  That's also what's all about music.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.960]  So you tie a cannabis education music.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.880]  Peter will sign off on that real quick.
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.240]  That's another big thing that we're improving about the event this year is we are going to
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:26.560]  have a live band there or bands on Saturday night, but a big part of it, you know, last
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.760]  year and even more so this year is drum circle and, you know, and everybody, you know, contributing
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:36.480]  their verse and like that sense of community gathered around the fire under the full moon,
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.720]  like just celebrating being alive.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.600]  And like, it's a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:46.400]  And the community building that comes from it is just incredible.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.400]  And then we talk about being closed loop all the time and that's the goal, but that doesn't
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:51.440]  mean closed off.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.480]  And so like a lot of these people have resources on their property that, you know, they might
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:00.400]  have too much of, and you could really, really help them out while helping yourself and adding
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.880]  biodiversity to your compost and stuff like that.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:07.360]  I'm like, if we help each other and, you know, we team with our neighbors and farm together
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.720]  and harvest together, like you can get so much work done in one day, as opposed to a
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:16.560]  whole entire week, you know, while you're joking, while you're having fun and, you know,
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:19.040]  just, that's what, that's what it's about.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:23.520]  Hey, Layden, does that remind you of something that you, we used to talk about back in the
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.240]  sixties?
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:25.680]  Community.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:25.920]  Yeah.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.960]  And you know, that's, that's, that's spot on.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:36.880]  Those, the regen conferences were, were such a dream come true because the whole community
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:44.720]  came out and we're able to talk about, you know, their, their PSTD about cops and drug
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.400]  wars and all this fucking shit.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:51.360]  And it was, it was like, you know, you left there with hundreds of friends, you know,
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:52.880]  and you're right.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.600]  You know, there's drink teamwork makes dream work.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:56.720]  It's not even work anymore.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:58.800]  You're laughing and playing and having a good time.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:05.040]  So, and, and that's another great reason to do these compost cops is again, you know,
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:09.680]  bringing awareness to the community, bring in a couple extra bags and share it with your
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:12.640]  friends, have them bring that compost home and throw it in your pile.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.400]  Again, it's a diversity, right?
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.080]  Yep.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:19.680]  And that's, that's a huge part that we've talked about is, you know, everybody bringing
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:24.160]  their compost and mixing it, or even like an IMO collection, which I wanted to talk
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.120]  to you guys about this and using rice and all that stuff.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:32.640]  But you know, bringing in diversity from the whole entire state and mixing that up.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:37.680]  And I know they preach IMO needs to be 50 miles from your property, but like, what's
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.480]  wrong with maximum diversity, even if some of it's not going to be exactly what your
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:45.920]  microclimate needs, it's still going to act as a food source for the others that we're
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:46.800]  talking about.
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.600]  Like you had something on that late.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:50.480]  Yeah.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:50.960]  Yeah.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:55.520]  I'm doing a wonderful project out here in LA.
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:01.200]  It's the largest natural animal bridge that's been ever built in the world.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:08.800]  And basically we are growing out the plants, the indigenous plants to cover the bridge
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:12.560]  so that the animals don't know that they're actually on the bridge.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.360]  That's awesome.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:13.600]  Yeah.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.600]  They're doing soundproofing underneath it.
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.280]  And they're really going all out in this.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:20.080]  And Efren and I are collaborating.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.600]  He's doing the mycorrhizae.
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.960]  I'm doing the sap robes and the protozoa and other bacteria.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:29.760]  And so we talked about these collections and different tools and techniques.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:36.000]  So we're going to play around with other substrates, including some of these other
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.360]  grains to see how well they work and react in the collection process.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:47.040]  We've even talked about mixing a whole bunch together and then just seeing how that interacts.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:50.240]  So I'll definitely keep you posted on that work.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:50.880]  For sure.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.880]  Because it will be well documented.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:53.360]  Awesome.
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:59.440]  And a big part of it for me is from a mushroom cultivator standpoint, you're not sterilizing
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:16:59.840]  that grain.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.280]  You're not even really pasteurizing it.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.800]  You're like half cooking it.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.320]  And then you're putting it out into the field.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.200]  And so that grain's already contaminated from the get-go.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:12.560]  I doubt you're cooking off all the endophytes and everything that was living inside of it
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.120]  and all the indigenous microbes from the rice paddy.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:23.360]  And so that's like, I don't know, you could just be culturing the microbes from the rice
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.560]  when you put it out there.
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.400]  And so I don't know.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:32.160]  We got a mycologist friend that's seen a lot of really, really similar collections from
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.680]  all these different diverse cultures.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.440]  And they all seem to be primarily the same groups.
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:40.880]  And so he's thinking, OK, well, it's the rice microbes.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.600]  And so it doesn't really matter.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:46.560]  I've never heard that, dude.
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:46.960]  I like that.
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:47.680]  Yeah.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.720]  So whether or not you're culturing microbes from your old growth forest, which, I mean,
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:58.080]  let's face it, if you're putting a box of rice out in Michigan, when's the last time
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.600]  those microbes have ever seen rice?
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.000]  Like, sure, you're going to get some.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.120]  But you're going to get the alphas that are opportunistic and stuff.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:12.560]  You're not going to get a great collection because not everybody thrives on rice.
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.080]  They've never seen rice up here.
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:21.280]  And so whether or not you're culturing native microbes from the soil or you're just culturing
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:25.840]  microbes from the rice field or whatever, the microbes flying through the air, you're
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.040]  still culturing microbes.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.680]  And so when you apply that, it's still going to work in your soil because you're still
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.280]  adding all this biodiversity and stuff.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:37.440]  But where that biodiversity actually is coming from is a question that I'd like to know
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:38.000]  more about.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.680]  Well, you bring up a very, very valid point.
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:51.440]  And there has never been a thorough study on what it is you're actually culturing.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.560]  I will tell you this.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:58.480]  You're definitely culturing yeasts that probably were not part of the rice.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.840]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:00.720]  Those are flying through the air.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.880]  Those are going to culture on anything really, really easily.
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:03.760]  Dr. Andy Bocman Right.
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:10.640]  And you know, this is one of the reasons why I started playing around with fish manure
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:13.280]  was because of the diversity that I found in it.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:23.840]  Especially in a healthy, aerobically run aquaculture company, the manure was amazing.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.240]  It was very easy to stabilize.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:31.680]  And by stabilize, I mean, when it smells sweet, you know that you're in that zone, kind of
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:32.320]  like the forest.
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:38.560]  You stick your hand in the soil and you pick it up and you smell that beautiful aerobic
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.120]  smell.
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.360]  The same is true with this fish brew.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:46.480]  And we actually have them coming on next week because I finally got, yeah, dying to
[01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:51.280]  share the information that they've been sharing with me about, you know, the diversity that
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:51.760]  they have.
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:53.680]  It's mind-boggling.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:01.120]  And they sent samples off down to Texas to Mr. DNA to really kind of bring in a bigger,
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:04.080]  broader stroke on what's really going on.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:07.520]  I mean, they didn't culture or they didn't pick individual organisms.
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.320]  They went for genetic barcoding.
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:15.760]  So you're getting an idea of the bigger picture, which keeps the cost down.
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:21.120]  Because if you try to DNA each and every organism, it's like, dude, forget it.
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.680]  You're talking the rest of your life, if not two lifetimes.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:36.800]  So there is a really cheap, ineffective way to get, you know, not cultured, but indigenous
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:40.560]  microbes that live in a cultural environment.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.480]  Their raceways are all outside.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:45.440]  So they're getting the air, they're getting sun, they're getting rain.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:51.440]  Where some of the other facilities I worked in were indoors and they were way less diverse
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.120]  than fish brews.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.720]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:55.280]  Oh, definitely.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:55.600]  Dr. Tim Jackson
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.960]  You can do this at home.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:04.240]  Like if you can find a healthy stream or a creek or a river, you can easily just collect
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:09.040]  some of the aquatic plant life on the shore, on the edge, and even get some of that mud
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.360]  that you're gonna get your purple sulfur bacteria.
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:11.520]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.400]  Exactly.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.600]  Yeah, we talked about the PNSB being in the belly of the worm, but it's also in
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:20.080]  mud next to ponds and stuff like that.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.040]  You can definitely find it there.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.200]  It's everywhere like we're talking about.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:24.260]  Anything.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:25.840]  Incredible.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:26.560]  Dr. Russell Jaffe
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.640]  There's a real quick question there from Ross.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.360]  Dr. Tim Jackson
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:32.560]  Brings my water down to like 4 pH.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:35.280]  Is that okay or should I adjust it?
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.240]  No, don't adjust it.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.560]  Just just just apply it.
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:47.680]  It's funny that some people have seen that the pH does change and others have not.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:54.640]  So I would advise you just to go ahead and apply it as as you once you get it as recommended
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.720]  and don't stress about the pH.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:58.160]  It's not gonna make any big difference.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:21:59.680]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.240]  And maybe Chandler, you can check from what I understand, too.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:07.200]  If everything's alive and thriving, especially with the worms, they're not gonna let the pH.
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:11.440]  That's why we don't worry about it anymore is because they're not gonna let it get out of control.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.640]  Chandler Bickerson
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:15.760]  Yeah, everything kind of balances itself out unless you add
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.360]  something to throw it out of out of balance.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.000]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.280]  Well, if you're a moron, right?
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.720]  As Leighton always tries to tell you.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:22.960]  Chandler Bickerson
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:25.120]  Yeah, you're putting so much on there.
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:25.680]  Chandler Bickerson
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:32.320]  It's that extreme, anything way too extreme that throws it way too far out of balance is bad.
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:37.600]  You want to maintain that balance in whether it's biology, everything, it's got to be in the
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.280]  balance. Find the sweet spot, folks. Find the sweet spot.
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.400]  Chandler Bickerson
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.120]  Goldilocks.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.640]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.140]  Oz.
[01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:47.680]  Chandler Bickerson
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.760]  Well, you're kind of blowing my mind over here, Chandler.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.520]  We've been talking about IMOs all year.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:57.760]  And it seemed like it was really hard when you're first putting out your boxes to see success.
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:02.240]  You know, and you come back and you're smoking and everybody's trying to figure things out.
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:06.240]  And it always seemed like why would that be, you know, so much harder than it?
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:10.000]  Now that you're talking about, you're just basically, you know, driving in an hour and a
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.720]  half or whatever it is, going really deep out, putting your little boxes out there.
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:22.720]  And then you're basically curing and creating your rice stuff that you could have done an hour
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:23.200]  and a half back.
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.400]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.320]  So, you know, obviously that's for a different day. But I think we're gonna obviously have a
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:32.400]  show on that at some point because it makes a lot of sense. And I love hearing different views.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:37.360]  I mean, I know, right, Dr. Lane Eham's camp, like sometimes they don't like to hear
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:41.760]  other aspects to that. But I think that's what opens up the community that you had mentioned
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:45.920]  at the beginning. We don't know half of what we're fucking talking about. I mean,
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.720]  a lot of us are just saying what other people have said to us. We read it in a book real quick.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:53.920]  And then all of a sudden, it seems like gospel. But as the years go by,
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:58.720]  things continue to change rapidly with everything that we're talking about today.
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.840]  Dr. Lane Eham Yeah. And so me personally,
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:07.280]  I've gotten away from the rice IMO collections and I'll just go collect forest stuff and put
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:13.680]  that into my compost pile. And like you have the physical plant matter as well as all the microbes
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:19.920]  on it and stuff and like indigenous microbes eat indigenous food sources. And so like, it just makes
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.760]  so much more sense to take that put that right into your soil right to your compost pile or
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:29.040]  brew that into your compost tea or use that as your inoculant for your JMS, you know, like,
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:34.480]  instead of trying to culture it on a different substrate, and like pros and cons. And like I
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:38.960]  said, a lot of people have had great success with the rice cultures. And you know, and so like,
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:45.040]  if it's working, it's working. And if you like doing it, and rice isn't super expensive, or
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:52.000]  etc, etc. But I think just going out for a walk and collecting stuff from a super healthy patch
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:55.280]  is a whole lot easier and probably more effective.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:58.960]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani I agree 100%. Now I would just say to people,
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:07.360]  please, wild craft respectfully, yes, bring in something, bring in compost, bring in chips,
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:11.760]  I don't care what it is. Yeah, not leave a scar where you exactly.
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.200]  Unknown Speaker So I've been doing this for years,
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:19.600]  and you're one of the ones who taught me that importance of bringing something to give back,
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:25.600]  you know, and but I've been thinking about that and like would bring in a bacterial dominant compost
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:32.720]  to the old growth forest. I don't you know, it's like, it's not the preferred nitrogen source.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:39.760]  It's tossing in some, I don't know, I feel like you could look at it both ways. But I absolutely
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.560]  love the idea of honoring the forest and putting as much respect and like giving your thanks
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:50.560]  and covering up that wound with surrounding stuff like bringing your good vibes into the forest,
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:58.880]  you know, and everything like that. But I wonder if you know, bringing in a food source that is an
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:03.360]  indigenous to that area is is truly what's best. Dr. Justin Marchegiani Alright, I want you to
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:10.000]  think about this. Before mass expansion of humanity, there was mass migrations.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:17.760]  Everything got moved everywhere. So bringing in a bacterial dominant into a
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:27.120]  fungally dominant 1000 to 1 FTP soil, you're not going to hurt it. You're you're what you brought
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:32.240]  in is a food source. It's a bio stim. You're gonna get gobbled up and the fungi are gonna push in
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.720]  and take over. So- Dr. Justin Marchegiani For sure, exactly like we've been saying,
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:38.720]  even if it's not conducive for that environment, it's just gonna act as a feeder stock for
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:41.520]  your IMO that are- Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, and it's again,
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:48.880]  it's more important that you are respecting Gaia, showing that you're not there to take-
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:51.360]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Exactly, get away from that extractionist.
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:54.800]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Right, exactly. And to be honest with you,
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:02.240]  you know, whenever I'm out in nature, if I see something plant that catches my eyes, I grab it,
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:07.760]  throw it in the compost pile. Because it's if once you get to that level where you're connected,
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:15.200]  you're listening to your intuition, then you know that she's talking to you. Like, another thing
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:22.000]  that's that I've done for years is collect plants in incredibly harsh environments like that weed
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.720]  or that indicator plant that grows in the crack in the middle of the friggin highway. That I want
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:37.120]  that guy. I want him in my compost pile. Because there's something there that allowed that plant
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:43.280]  to thrive in an incredibly harsh human environment. And you know, there again,
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:51.760]  it's a great way to add diversity to your compost pile, to your extract, to your tea, whatever it
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:56.320]  is. And don't be afraid to get that root ball because that's where the magic really is.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.720]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani So there's my two cents on that one.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.920]  Dr. Tim Jackson I love it. Thank you. And I love that comment.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:05.280]  If you don't have anything to offer, just clean up the forest. And that's huge.
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:05.840]  Whenever I...
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:08.800]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Because you could go deep in the forest and find beer cans.
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:12.640]  Dr. Tim Jackson Dude, it's insane. It blows my mind how people
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:17.440]  can go out hunting, you know, and spend so much time in nature and still be so disconnected and
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:24.400]  leave beer cans and all this trash and stuff. I don't know. It blows my mind. But I always have
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:30.000]  a separate bag to collect trash whenever I go out. And a lot of times you'll find really cool
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:36.160]  terrariums that it's like Mother Nature's gift to you. This perfect glass bottle with an ecosystem
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:40.720]  in there. And it really makes me question, you know, should I pick this up? Nature's already
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:47.520]  figured out what to do with it. It's not plastic. It's glass. Most of the time I'll take it because
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:53.120]  something could get hurt on jagged edges or anything like that. But it really makes you
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:29:01.040]  question. Like Mother Nature's just always adapting to everything. And there's something
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:07.760]  already turned that trash into a home and is thriving in it. Still saying clean up the trash.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:11.680]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, I mean, a beer can is not
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.960]  exactly what you'd want. But Mother Nature is going to find a way.
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:15.920]  Dr. Tim Jackson Some of these old,
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:20.480]  beautiful glass bottles, you'll find like some vintage medicine bottles and stuff with moss
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.560]  growing in it. Wow, what a gift. Like this is amazing.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.800]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Agreed 100%. Nature will find a way for sure.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:36.480]  You know, no matter what we do. I don't care if we nuke the planet. She'll come back. We won't be
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:41.920]  around. I sure hopes she'd come back. Alexa, do you have something to add?
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:46.720]  Alexa Oh, gosh, there's a lot said there. Okay,
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:54.080]  first, I will say that, yeah, I've been conflicted about picking up trash lately, because I did
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:30:02.880]  recently. And under a plastic bag that I picked up that was like in the middle of the of like,
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:09.680]  a, you know, weed field, there was a ton of mycelium like growing under it. And I picked
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:14.480]  it up. And I was like, Oh, God, I just like disturbed like this mycelium, like it would
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:19.200]  not be able to grow here without this like plastic bag laying in the middle of the field. So
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:25.920]  I don't know, it was just like a funny thing to me to just like see like how you know, nature just
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:33.200]  takes all of this inorganic stuff that you know, we've put here and transmute it and makes it into,
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:43.600]  you know, something organic again. So um, yeah, and another thing with the culturing IMO on the
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:49.760]  rice. Yeah, that's something really cool that one of our mycologist friends like brought up to me
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:56.320]  one day I posted about like, IMO and he was like, Hey, like, what have you seen under the microscope
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:03.040]  like in your IMO? And you know, I was like, honestly, I don't and he was like, I'm talking
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:10.560]  about, um, do you really think it's a diverse input? And I was like, you know, I don't really
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.720]  know, I don't have too much experience. And he shared with me that he's seen a lot of
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:22.800]  collections, like Chandler said that had the same diversity in there. So that was just like,
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:33.680]  really interesting to hear. And then, but we did see so the another co founder of the compost cup,
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:42.800]  his name is Mike. And the compost cup is on his property. So huge shout out for to Mike.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:51.840]  So on his property last year, he did this like really cool experiment with his plants, and he
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:32:02.000]  applied IMO to his plants, all of them except a couple of them. And they were going through some
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:09.840]  pest or disease problem. And the ones that did not get the IMO, like were pretty much dead,
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:15.360]  like they were not growing at all. And then the ones that did get the IMO, were growing through
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:21.760]  the disease that they had, and turned out to be really great plants. So I'm just going back to
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:29.520]  what Chandler said of, you know, there's not necessarily like a bad way to culture microbes,
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:35.840]  as long as we're adding those microbes to the soil, they can act as like, a fertilizer,
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:40.720]  like because those bacteria are so like nutrient rich, we kind of don't think of
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:49.680]  bacteria as a fertilizer, but they can be when, when put into certain environments, where
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:58.720]  those nutrients can be cycled and released. So um, yeah, that's it. And yeah, I'm getting more
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:04.560]  towards, um, instead of like culturing IMO on rice, like doing what Chandler said, and
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:16.640]  using the forest leaf mold humus to as an inoculant for compost piles and like the JLF,
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:22.080]  like I was talking about earlier had so much diversity, which I'm really excited about,
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:28.160]  um, you know, trying new JLF mixes. So yeah.
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:32.240]  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah. And just so everybody understands,
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:38.160]  bacteria have a C to N ratio like every living thing. And so when they are consumed,
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:44.160]  either they're releasing carbon, or they're releasing nitrogen. And if you ever got a
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:57.600]  earth fork test, there is a specific line item called your nitrogen cycling system. And so
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:04.000]  basically what that means is that if you say you got 150, that's 150 pounds of nitrogen that will
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:12.960]  be cycled and available for plants over a 90 day period. Think about that. You know, that's huge.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:20.560]  So bacteria are fertilizer, definitely. And more importantly, they have a lot of
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:27.600]  micronutrients in their pantry. So a bacteria will mine a piece of silt or clay or sand, whatever.
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:34.720]  And it will store those micronutrients in its pantry so that if it comes up against a pH shift,
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:42.080]  a very wet, a wet time or very dry time, it can make adjustments inside chemically to its
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:47.920]  to its own self. So all of that's released plant available when that bacteria is consumed in the
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:54.880]  rhizosphere. Yeah, I mean, the bacteria, the more bacteria you can get into that system,
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.960]  the more fertilizer you're getting. So that's why I always say, you know,
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:07.920]  is F to B ratio critical? Is C to N ratio critical in compost making? I mean, I've had some
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:14.000]  conversations with, you know, really high up compost celebrities and they're like, oh,
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.520]  C to N, C to N. And I'm like, you know, I still got to get good stuff if you ignore that.
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:25.520]  Why? Why? Why? You know, I understand that we generally look at it like the high nitrogens
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:31.040]  are going to heat up and cause problems. But if you're managing the pile, then it's not an issue.
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:38.720]  And to be honest with you, I'll have compost that I strip the biology of that's 30 to 1.
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:43.680]  You know, it's way out of whack. And that would be considered a fail. You know, at Wood's End,
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:50.240]  oh, your C to N ratio needs to be down around 15. It doesn't. It doesn't. It's just you have to
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:55.600]  manage it when you have that much nitrogen or you're going to kill shit. So, you know, that's
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:01.920]  there's so much to compost that, you know, we can just talk weeks, days, years of stuff.
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:02.880]  No doubt.
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.120]  You want to add something, Alexa?
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:10.800]  Yeah, for sure. I mean, that's something that we talk about with the compost education that
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:17.040]  Chandler and I do together. It's like, there's so many different ways to compost and, you know,
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:23.440]  every situation is going to be so different. It just kind of depends on what your goals are and
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:29.680]  mostly what you have available to you on your property or, you know, from your neighbors.
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:38.240]  So, we kind of can give you like the template or the recipe, but you kind of color it in and
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.120]  make it your own.
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:43.600]  Exactly. And a lot of these guidelines are for when you're just starting to get,
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:48.960]  you know, a baseline and to understand things without going way out of whack. But once you
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:52.960]  understand the basic principles, you can absolutely go off and explore a little bit
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:53.920]  and get creative with it.
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:00.400]  Well, I love it that you guys are putting a guide together. That's fantastic because,
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:07.840]  you know, it's funny. In the time I did down at Rodale, like Elaine brought in all of these
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:14.320]  proteges from all over the country for this internship for the summer and they struggled
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:20.880]  to make compost. I mean, they struggled hard. And I was like, well, how come my compost is so good?
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:26.960]  And it used to be the answer she said to me was because you have no preconceived notions.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.880]  You don't know what the fuck you're doing, right? You just, you took what I said to you,
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:37.760]  one third greens, two thirds browns, and you ran with it. And yeah, you're killing it.
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.760]  And so, and again, the things that I was doing was going for diversity. Like I didn't just go
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:49.360]  get some hay. I was out cutting, I was the lunatic running around, picking everything I
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:55.040]  could possibly get from every place I could find it. And one of the keys was new, fresh shoots.
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:00.880]  Like any plant that has a new, tender little shoot, you're getting all the plant hormones,
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:06.800]  you're getting all the endophytes, you're getting, and it breaks down so easy because it's young and
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:13.520]  tender. That ramiel chipped wood. Dude, I'm telling you, it's not hard. And the only hard
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:20.000]  part is moisture management, making sure because it's, it's so new, it doesn't hold a lot of
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.200]  moisture. Like the fresh green stuff holds moisture. The Brownstone. So all I did was
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:30.560]  soak the fucking Browns, put them in a bucket, put a screen over the top board water and to hold it
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:37.600]  down, got it prepped. And now it's not hydrophobic. So when I mix it together with the greens,
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:42.480]  my water management is cut in half because it's exactly not fighting anything.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.280]  So those are a couple of tricks I hope you put in your guidebook.
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:49.760]  Speaker 3 Oh, absolutely. No, it's a huge one for wood chips is if you don't soak them
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:54.160]  overnight or whatever, it's fully submerged, then they're just totally hydrophobic. When you water,
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:58.640]  all the water just goes all around them. It doesn't soak anything up. But if you were to soak it,
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:02.720]  then you're never going to have to hardly water your pile because it's a sponge.
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:06.240]  Speaker 2 Exactly. And you guys are fortunate. You got
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:11.920]  plenty of rain. We're fucked. And so those tricks
[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:16.640]  are so important that, you know, to conserve water because otherwise you're going to put
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:20.480]  empty pouring water on it, trying to get it to turn hydrophilic.
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:21.120]  Speaker 3 Yep.
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.840]  Speaker 1 I've noticed when I'm soaking bark,
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:29.520]  if I add a little bit of that full power, it seems like the bark starts to be a little bit easier for
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:35.600]  the decomposers to break it down. Do you just think that's just the fulvic acid doing its magic?
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:39.440]  Speaker 2 Yes. Fulvic acid has one of the lowest
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:47.440]  molecular weights of any substance that we have ever found. So therefore, it very easily soaks in
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:55.520]  to your skin, to cells, to materials, especially wood. It'll go right in there. And as it goes in
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:04.000]  there and it creates a similar to what's that product that makes the water spread out? Come on,
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:04.400]  Leighton.
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:06.720]  Speaker 1 Trophactin?
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:07.200]  Speaker 2 Trophactin.
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:09.040]  Speaker 3 Is it a non-wetting agent?
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:13.680]  Yeah, it acts as a surfactant. It helps the water get in there and spread out even.
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:14.320]  Speaker 1 Yep.
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:15.360]  Speaker 2 Water is better.
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:15.920]  Speaker 1 Makes water better.
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:18.560]  Speaker 2 Literally, right? Literally,
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:20.320]  water's fucked up, man. Let's not go down there.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.960]  Speaker 1 Makes water wetter. Is that what you said?
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:23.440]  Speaker 3 Yep.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:27.120]  Speaker 1 Yeah. That was, that was, it sounded so weird when I first heard that.
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:27.200]  Speaker 3 For real.
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:29.520]  Speaker 1 But then once you start to study it a little bit, it's like, oh,
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:33.120]  okay. I mean, it's a weird way to say it, but I get what they're saying now.
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:40.640]  Speaker 3 Yep. I want to talk a little bit about,
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:44.480]  you mentioned the fungal to bacteria ratio. A lot of people get caught up on that,
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:48.960]  you know, literally thinking about fungi or bacteria. But I think like the main thing that,
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:55.600]  yeah, the idea is like, what's the preferred nitrogen source? And if it's bacterial dominant,
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:00.800]  you know, the pH is going to be up over seven, and you're going to have nitrogen, you're going
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:06.800]  to have those bacteria converting it into nitrates. But if you have a fungal dominant soil below with
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:15.760]  a more acidic pH, that's going to have nitrogen and the ammonium form. And to me, that was like a
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:21.520]  realization that didn't seem like reading about fungal to bacteria ratios was like super easy
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:25.120]  to like understand that they're mainly talking about like the preferred nitrogen source.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.560]  From my understanding, is that kind of...
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:31.680]  Speaker 3 Dude, you're spot on. And that's a wonderful
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:39.360]  gold bar is that ratio is really helping you to understand what are you cycling and ammonia,
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:46.320]  you need more water when you're consuming ammoniacal sources of nitrogen, and you need
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:53.120]  a more organic matter when you're dealing with a nitrate form of nitrogen. Because that's what
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:59.440]  the bacteria need to consume to make the energy to break it down and use it. And something else that,
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:05.760]  you know, again, not to bash Soil Food Web, it was it was one of the most important first steps
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:14.400]  in starting these conversations. But in the fungal to bacteria ratio, they don't include mycorrhizae.
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:21.600]  They don't include yeast, they don't include molds. That's three quarters of the entire
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.240]  fungal kingdom that's not being recorded.
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:27.200]  Speaker 2 Absolutely. And that was a huge part to me,
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:34.880]  too, is like thinking about fungal to bacteria. And fungi being, you know, just the sap probes,
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:40.240]  just the stuff that's breaking down the organic matter. But a lot of it is the mycorrhizal fungi
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:42.320]  that these plants are associated with. And like,
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:45.760]  Speaker 3 Oh, yeah. And let's not rule out the
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:50.480]  yeast and the molds. I mean, they're a foundation. If they're not present, the other ones can't be
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:55.360]  there. So yeah, there's there's a lot more to some of these.
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:03.520]  So again, testing methods that need to improve. And they will in time. I mean, I think that
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:10.880]  AI is going to be critical for this. I think that the microscope, again, is a beautiful tool,
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:16.080]  incredibly valuable and powerful. But we as humans, if we're in a good mood, we're going to
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:20.400]  see good things. If we're in a bad mood, we're not going to see anything good. And that's that's the
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:27.440]  human factor. It's a huge problem. You know, and I don't know about you two, but I sit down and do
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:34.320]  a little prayer for like, please, let me see what I'm supposed to see, not what I want to see or not
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:42.080]  what I don't. Yeah, you really need to be grounded to get an accurate example. And that that is
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:48.560]  probably one of the biggest missing pieces from, you know, all microscope classes. That should be
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:52.880]  the forefront. That should be the first thing you before you ever touch it before you even talk
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:59.360]  about it. You got to get your mental health or your your your your persona in order before you
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:07.200]  act like a god and look at this and try to determine or guide somebody into what they
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:13.200]  should do. And, you know, another piece of this puzzle that really bothers me is nobody talks
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:20.080]  about collecting. So where do you collect? How do you collect? And personally, I spend
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:25.040]  the if I'm going to spend an hour behind the microscope, I want to spend an hour collecting.
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:30.160]  And I want to observe everything around me. Because I've had people sit there and say, oh,
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:35.280]  you know, this is horribly anaerobic. This, you know, this is the problem. And you go and you say,
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:40.640]  well, all the plants are healthy here. What do you mean it's anaerobic? You obviously have a wet patch,
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:48.560]  dude. It's a seep of some kind. How are you how are you guiding somebody when you have no idea
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:53.760]  where that sample was collected, the environment in which it was collected? That's 50 percent of
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:58.880]  the information you're missing. Absolutely. And so, you know, again, it's, you know, these
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:08.080]  perhaps flawed or perhaps not being truly in tune with what it is that you're actually doing.
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:13.840]  Those kinds of things have to change. And, you know, that, again, is something that should be
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:19.920]  banged into your head before you ever touch a microscope that 50 percent of that is what you
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:24.560]  saw when you were making that collection. How can you be intelligent without that?
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:31.760]  I think that's something that you guys should consider adding into your educational platform
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:37.280]  is to make sure that that side of it, the energetic side and the right mindset is covered
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:41.360]  when you're doing your talks. Oh, absolutely. And we're always talking about the energy that
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:47.760]  we bring into the garden. And, you know, the plants can feel that. I met a I met a cool chick
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:53.120]  at one of Chris Trump's events and she was talking about that, that she only uses the microscope with
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.760]  her shoes off on the dirt. And, you know, it kind of got some chuckles and stuff. And to me,
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:01.520]  you know, I was kind of like, oh, whatever, you know, some people think. But
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:05.200]  now it's starting to make a little more sense. I like it.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:16.080]  Yeah, I've definitely tried, you know, I use the microscope a lot and personally,
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:23.920]  I've never really seen too much of a difference. Like I totally believe it. But like energetically,
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:31.600]  I guess I don't know, maybe, maybe I'll have to I'll have to pay more attention to it. But
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:39.920]  something that I have noticed with like, I guess, the method, the soil food web method of
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:47.200]  quantifying organisms is that it's supposed to be like a random, you know, so you look at the
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:51.680]  sample and you go to a random field of view, and that's where you take the reading. But sometimes
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:57.680]  when I do that, I don't feel like I get a very good representation just because I might get
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:03.360]  unlucky and like land on all fields of view with no organisms. And then I just don't feel like it's
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:12.240]  a good representation of like what's actually in the compost. So yeah, I don't know. I guess that's
[01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:17.840]  that's my biggest. That's a good point. It's like a Google Earth view, like you zoom in,
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:23.040]  but how are you? You don't necessarily know how that suburban town is really operating.
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:29.760]  Mm hmm. You know, I had the same issue the first day that Elaine taught me,
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:34.000]  oh, this is how we do just spin it. And then we don't count it. I was like,
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:44.160]  so what I do is I scope the whole slide with 400 just to see what's going on or 40. And then when
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:52.640]  I'm trying to count the organisms, then I'll go back and use that method. Because she had that
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:48:00.160]  deviated or standard deviation kind of offset shit. But no, you're absolutely right. I mean,
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:13.920]  as it is, you're looking at one fucking drop of water from 10 mils of soil, which is a joke.
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:18.720]  When you're looking at anything more than like maybe that much soil,
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:24.240]  you know, that might give you a good indicator what's going on this, this much soil, but one
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:30.640]  inch away, you know, you got a different environment. Oh, that's why we mix so many
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:36.800]  different soils together. Yes. So you mix so many soils together. You still taking a random
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:43.360]  fucking pinprick of time, time to yeah. Mm hmm. What the fuck are you really learning?
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:50.720]  Mm hmm. That being said, the microscope still has a very valuable asset as far as trying to
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:55.920]  understand and manage what it is you're doing. It still has value, but you have to keep that
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:02.560]  perspective in the back. Mm hmm. Totally. So kind of like what I do now after just like seeing so
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:10.400]  many samples and different varieties of them is like now I kind of have a good idea of what like
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:16.960]  is a good compost just by or a good soil or whatever I'm looking at just by having seen so
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:22.960]  many samples at this point. So that's kind of just like what I based it off of now is like,
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:29.440]  you know, am I seeing, you know, as much fungi as I would in like a forest soil or something like
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:35.040]  that? And yeah, I guess another thing, too, is like when I first started with the microscope
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:41.120]  and I know like Elaine talks about like my seeds and like yeast and stuff being like
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:48.800]  detrimental organisms in the soil. And I started seeing like things that would be classified as
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:55.600]  like a new my seat. So that's like she says they're like a clear hyphy with like a small
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:02.320]  diameter and like no septa. So I would see those and like almost every like soil sample I started
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:07.680]  taking and I was like, oh, my gosh, plants are going to die like we got a fungal pathogen. And
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:12.720]  then I, you know, started seeing them in every sample, like I said, so I was like, OK, obviously,
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:19.680]  these organisms are not as bad as, you know, maybe I thought they were everywhere because
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.880]  they're everywhere. You know, I got to add something to this. And I've had this conversation
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:31.920]  with Buddy Effron times. This is something else that's not being taught appropriately,
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:39.920]  that is that it takes seven days for a fungal spore to show its genealogy. So
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:49.040]  that seven day period, that is going to be a clear, small diameter, no septi
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:56.320]  until it gets to the maturity level. And how will you ever know? Because your slide is going to dry
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:03.840]  out in 20 fucking minutes. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's another thing I've looked at fresh growing
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:11.200]  like mycelium under the microscope, and it's always clear like that. Yeah. So, you know, again,
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:18.320]  we're zeroing in on some of these really, really important things, but we're stumbling along the
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:24.960]  way and we're not keeping up with what I should say as the speed at which the knowledge is being
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:32.080]  released. And that's that's something that this platform is trying to do is trying to get people
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:36.800]  to understand that. Yeah, there's some there's some gaps here. People, there's definitely some
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:41.840]  missing gaps in the knowledge and understanding what's going on. And I have another question for
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:47.840]  you, Alex. It's kind of personal. How do you prevent yourself from getting depressed when
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:52.000]  every soil sample you look at does not have the level of life that you should be?
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:52:06.880]  Um, we just looks at wormy soil and I just look at wormy compost and I inoculate whatever,
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:10.480]  you know, is missing with wormies and we're good to go.
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:16.640]  It's been amazing, though, the amount of slides that she sent me or captures where, you know,
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:23.600]  the whole soil food web is in one point of view and one field of view. Like, it's pretty incredible.
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:30.240]  Yeah, I mean, the amount of like fungi you guys have in that compost is like really incredible.
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:37.360]  Like I don't see compost with like these huge wefts of fungi. But yeah, and then that translates
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:43.920]  into the compost extracts and the teas that I'm making as well. So it's just yeah, really good
[01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:50.400]  stuff. You guys are at the forefront of making high quality compost. That is for sure.
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:57.040]  Thank you very much. Super excited. Earth Fort just asked us if they can, you know, advertise
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:00.960]  us as some of the better stuff around. So that means a lot for sure.
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:06.960]  Yeah, they actually reached out to me too. I was like, wow, thank you.
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:08.480]  That's awesome, man. No surprise.
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.560]  And that was actually on commercial.
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.320]  Oh, very cool.
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:17.280]  Yeah, which you guys, I still got quite a bit of work to do.
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:18.320]  Oh, man. I can't even imagine.
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:27.840]  I'm learning that this wonderfully beautiful relationship with calcium and nitrogen. So
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:33.360]  the first round or it was not the first, it was probably the third scale up.
[01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:40.000]  I started fooling around with this mineral powders and calcium rich stone dust
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:46.480]  and blended it with the compost. Now I fucked up the bulk density. So bulk density is the weight.
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:54:02.800]  So what I ended up with, I went from 0.05 nitrogen to 4.832. I made a fertilizer
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:07.040]  out of the compost by adding these rock dust and these mineral powders.
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:14.080]  Who the fuck knew that calcium will help grab organic nitrogen and make it in a stable form?
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:14.800]  Wow.
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:17.600]  Yeah. So keep posted. I'll keep you posted as the work.
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:20.240]  Yeah, dude. So much cool shit.
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:20.880]  Right?
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:22.560]  So excited, dude.
[01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:24.560]  How lucky am I? I get to play with this shit.
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:25.120]  For real.
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:27.200]  Yeah. And then we get to pick your brain.
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:29.360]  We get to learn.
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:31.040]  You do all the work and then you tell us.
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:36.320]  Well, that was actually one of the questions I had for you concerning with
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:42.320]  wormies and stuff is calcium. It seems like calcium is king in almost anything that you're
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:48.400]  doing. If you're able to add more, it seems like reproductions go up from the worms to the
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:54.800]  springtails, isopods. Now even I'm starting to see with the rove beetles. So maybe that is one of
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:55:00.640]  the nutrients that's maybe a little harder to find in a basement grow is calcium. So putting your-
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:05.680]  That's just one of the great things about the worm is they literally add calcium carbonate
[01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:13.040]  they produce that chemical and put it into the food that they're digesting before the microbes
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:19.360]  get to it. And so they calcify everything that they're eating. And I could pull up the numbers.
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:26.640]  It's in Jeff Lowenfeld's book, but he's got the numbers on how much calcium is in there after the
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:33.680]  worm eats the organic matter compared to before. But for NPK, at least they can increase the NPK
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:39.920]  value by like five to 11 times compared to the food source that they just ate. So just by cycling
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:46.720]  it through the bacteria on their gut. So they're kind of like just giant nematodes. They're cycling
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:52.400]  bacteria, but on a huge scale. And so that's what's providing the plant available nutrients
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:59.280]  in their castings. Yeah, that brings up a really good point. I was going to ask you if it was
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:06.640]  cycling in their digestive tract, because that's something, you know, a huge realization
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:15.040]  I've come to lately is like that we have a soil food web in our digestive tract as well.
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:22.800]  In that like we as humans are not really doing any digesting. It's all the microbes doing all
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:27.760]  the breaking down and making things available and synthesizing these like vitamins for us.
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:36.800]  So yes, and you know, Leighton, that's something I've, you know, always liked about, you know,
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:43.200]  hearing you speak about medical grade compost, how, you know, I've been listening to Zach Bush
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:48.160]  lately, and he says, you know, there is supposed to be abundant protozoa in our stool, but you know,
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:54.160]  most people don't have this. So it's like, we don't have the soil food web in our guts either.
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:59.680]  So, you know, that's why I love the idea of, you know, medical grade compost that does have those
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:05.440]  like higher trophic level organisms that can, that go beyond bacteria that can
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:11.840]  cycle the nutrients within the bacteria. Because they are still nitrogen rich or mineral rich.
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:18.960]  And there's no reason that anybody can't make this. There's no reason. And unfortunately,
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:25.280]  you know, I will try not to rant. But I'll let it out. So fucking upset.
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:30.240]  I was gonna say we're past due you weren't here last week. So you at least two to three rants.
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:38.240]  Fucking for profit medical industry. I want to fucking grab them all by the throats and slam
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:44.320]  their head into the wall so they understand you're missing the two most important fucking pieces of
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:52.320]  all medicine, nutrition, and endocannabinoid health. All you do is prescribe fucking pills,
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.880]  and then more pills to counteract the first pills. And you don't talk about like,
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:01.920]  hey, what are you eating? Like that should be the first fucking question out of the doctor's mouth
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:09.440]  when you come in for any kind of a point. They never bring it up. It's like what the fuck is
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:14.480]  wrong? How dare you practice medicine? You're worse than the fucking barbarians that were
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:19.840]  practicing this shit in the dark ages. You've been bought out and conned by the fucking
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:25.520]  pharmaceutical industries who teach every single one of your fucking classes. Exactly. And you want
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:34.240]  me to come in there and let you fucking give me pills. Fuck you. And fuck your goddamn cancer and
[01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:40.320]  your fucking radiation medicine. Same for 50 years. You've raised billions of fucking dollars
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:47.760]  for cancer research. Where has it gone? Oh, to stuff into your fucking pockets? Your non-profit
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:59:01.060]  $500,000 a year job? Fuck you too. Thank you. We needed that brother. We definitely needed that.
[01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:08.260]  Amen, man. So anybody can make medical grade compost in a little fucking pouch. It doesn't
[01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:13.780]  have you don't have to make a mountain of this stuff. Just mix your browns and greens appropriately.
[01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:19.700]  Those fresh little green shoots are loaded with endophytes that will turn into protozoa and
[01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:29.460]  they'll come out both saprophytic, endophytic, as well as all of the necessary biology that you
[01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:34.500]  need in your stomach that you're not getting now. And then don't forget your fucking supplements
[01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:40.100]  because you're not getting your vitamins and minerals either. And so finding good sources of
[01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:45.700]  minerals and vitamins, LA figured it out a long time ago. It's called clay.
[01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:49.460]  They used to stir it in their drinks, the superstars and drink that shit.
[01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:56.500]  Bam. There you go. We got the nutrient cyclers and you got the raw materials,
[01:59:56.500 --> 02:00:03.700]  moan, clay, rock dust, eat those. I know it sounds fucking crazy, but if you want to live to 120,
[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:07.780]  there you go. There's the answer to there's your answer to long.
[02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:16.580]  Hell yeah. I've been capsuling off the brilliant black, the humic acid from dragonfly and I'm
[02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:22.580]  feeling great. I'm not. And full of acid. Yeah. There's so much more than just the humics in
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:27.380]  there. Yeah. I think there's humic, fulvic and a long list of microbes in there.
[02:00:30.500 --> 02:00:38.500]  Yeah. I drank like compost extract that I've made before and I really want to get into
[02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:45.540]  doing it more often. I just, I got nervous after I did it and like, I don't know, maybe,
[02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:50.180]  you know, cause there's not anything, no one out there is doing this. So I'm like, you know,
[02:00:50.180 --> 02:00:52.980]  the Guinea pig or whatever. So I don't know.
[02:00:57.620 --> 02:01:00.100]  You're running through the woods on the bicycle and then be like, Whoa.
[02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:06.820]  So Alexa worm castings like me and Leighton do.
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:14.660]  Yeah. Oh man. Oh man. I mean, I fucking eat dirt all the time. Anyway, a friend of mine, Jeff Frank,
[02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:22.580]  who had a educational platform called the green gorillas on Long Island, he was teaching
[02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:30.900]  how to transition into an organic land care system for landscapes. He was taught by Elaine. He
[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:38.100]  originally came from, which is a really cool story. Somewhere in Arizona, he was taking care
[02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:44.340]  of the firestones, botanical garden. So, you know, the firestones are extremely wealthy people.
[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:50.420]  One of the children built this incredible, you know, botanical garden had plants brought in from
[02:01:50.420 --> 02:01:54.580]  all over the world and there they are in the fucking desert. He's trying to take care of them.
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:59.460]  And all they kept doing was killing them and killing them because of the MPK. So finally,
[02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:06.180]  Jeff ran into Elaine somewhere and brought her down and said, how do I fix this? So lo and behold,
[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:10.900]  she taught him how to make compost, how to make Burma cast, make Burma compost. And he started
[02:02:10.900 --> 02:02:16.580]  employing these methods. And lo and behold, he could fucking take care of plants that didn't
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:27.540]  belong in that environment just based on the soil. Hello. Anyway, he, a buddy of mine, Bob Wilkinson
[02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:37.140]  is the or was the the head of operations for the New York Yankees. And so they were having
[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:45.140]  struggles keeping the field playable during the season. So Bob got a hold of this guy,
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:54.260]  Jeff, and brought him into the park and had him meet with the what's his name? Steinbrenner.
[02:02:55.060 --> 02:03:00.980]  And all the upbeat muckermucks. And the first thing he did, he brought out a plastic bottle
[02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:07.940]  and he showed me because this is compost extract. He goes, I know because you're a high impact and
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:13.300]  professional sports turf, you cannot have high levels of organic matter in the soil.
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:19.060]  So instead of top dressing with compost, which is going to hold moisture and make it slippery
[02:03:19.060 --> 02:03:23.700]  and cause all these other problems, we can just make an extract and apply that to your soil.
[02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:28.260]  And so everyone's like, oh, wow, this is great. Great. They took the bottle out and started
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:33.540]  drinking it and they fucking threw him out because they thought he was a lunatic. He had
[02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:39.780]  the answer to their fucking problem, but because he drank it, they freaked out and threw him out.
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:47.700]  So you're not alone. Don't worry. Be a stand up. Be the first one. Do it. Drink that shit. Eat that
[02:03:47.700 --> 02:03:52.740]  shit. Go for it. Don't be afraid. You're not going to get sick. You're actually going to get fucking
[02:03:52.740 --> 02:04:01.620]  healthy. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. It's so funny how I just have this ingrained fear of
[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:07.700]  homemade stuff. Even when I first started canning and fermenting and stuff, I was scared to eat what
[02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:15.940]  I canned and made. And I'm like, what is wrong with me right now? We've all been programmed too
[02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:27.780]  hard. Interesting fact that's horrifying is that at this point in time, four corporations own 90%
[02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:35.700]  of all of the food production in the world. So if you think that you eat a hamburger from
[02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:38.900]  McDonald's, it's any different than the hamburger you get from Whole Foods.
[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:46.580]  Shame on you. You're a fucking idiot because it's all controlled by four corporations. And what's
[02:04:46.580 --> 02:04:53.140]  worse than that is that they've all vertically integrated into packaging, into shipping,
[02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:59.700]  into slaughterhouses, into all aspects of food production. So there was an article that came out,
[02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:10.500]  I think, on Monday talking about the over 2,300 harmful chemicals that are being found in food
[02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:18.820]  packaging. Cans, plastic, tubs, all of it. And again, the companies that own this don't give a
[02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:24.020]  flying fuck about you. They're not here to make you healthy. They're probably working in conjunction
[02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:29.220]  with the pharmaceutical companies. Who would have thought of such a thing, right? Big corporations
[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:34.500]  working together to make more money off sick people? That couldn't fucking happen, right?
[02:05:35.300 --> 02:05:42.340]  Anyway, so the compounds are scary in the essence that they're present in the packaging. But what's
[02:05:42.340 --> 02:05:48.820]  more horrifying is the toxic soup that's being created with the combination of all of these
[02:05:48.820 --> 02:05:55.060]  things interacting. They'll never have time to study it to say, oh, this is healthier, this is
[02:05:55.060 --> 02:06:01.860]  unhealthy. They'll never have the time to do it. Do you think they thought of that? Like the
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:06.980]  insecticide industries which come out with a new pesticide every year because you don't have time
[02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:13.860]  to test it. So who's the guinea pig? Farmer? Eh, who cares? I just sold them a bunch of shit.
[02:06:15.220 --> 02:06:22.340]  Horrifying. Sorry, there's my second rant for today. So grow your own food, know your food
[02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:28.900]  sources, eat compost, drink compost extract. Make sure that you're getting some clay, some silt,
[02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:33.780]  and some sand into your diet on a regular basis so that your healthy gut can get the
[02:06:33.780 --> 02:06:37.460]  minerals and nutrients that you're not getting from those fucking corporations.
[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:40.820]  Thank you.
[02:06:44.740 --> 02:06:48.260]  And Alexa, you're fine. You're okay. You can eat the canned food.
[02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:56.260]  I'm going to now. I'm totally inspired. I'm going to make some compost extract shots out of wormies
[02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:58.820]  later probably. There you go.
[02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:06.340]  Yeah, we have a compost tea service now and we'll go spray entire properties like up to 45 minutes
[02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:12.340]  of spray time. Nice. Hey, I think at your compost cup, you guys should give away some compost shots
[02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:17.300]  as you come into the party. Just be like, hey, let's get this party started, man.
[02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:22.260]  Literally, if you go back and you check the post from last year, it says bring your own shot glass
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:29.300]  or spoon to try some of these inputs. I got all the different KNF inputs and
[02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:34.660]  inoculants and stuff. Yeah, there's so much crossover that you can... It's basically tinctures
[02:07:34.660 --> 02:07:41.220]  at that point to make the OHN. Those are all incredibly medicinal to us. It's cool when
[02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:46.180]  you get to taste the same stuff as your plant. That's what's really cool about brewing your own
[02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:50.820]  kombucha and using that in your garden or using that to make your EM. It's like your plants are
[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:55.940]  getting the same stuff that you are. It's just next level connection. Hey, we all come from the
[02:07:55.940 --> 02:08:01.700]  earth. We all go back to the earth. We are earthlings. That should mean something. It
[02:08:01.700 --> 02:08:06.100]  means we consume a lot of dirt. I had a question for you, Alexa.
[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:15.860]  Do you think longer time days fasting allows the body to create its own diverse microbes,
[02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:22.660]  or do you think you must add the sauerkraut and stuff to actually get the diversity again
[02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:28.420]  into the system? From my understanding with that, I watched
[02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:35.540]  the Huberman podcast and they had the Stanford doctor on there who did the study on the
[02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:42.660]  microbiome where they found fermented food increased diversity and well-being of these
[02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:51.700]  patients. Anyways, he said that fasting actually cleared out the microbiome.
[02:08:54.020 --> 02:09:01.780]  I think that would be good if, let's say, you have an overgrowth of archaea or candida
[02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:10.980]  or something like that. You could go into a fast and flush everything out, but then come back in
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:17.780]  with the sauerkraut and then work your way up to maybe a compost extract or something to gain that
[02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:25.540]  diversity back. Yeah, it's the same as antibiotics, man.
[02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:30.260]  You know how many people are consuming antibiotics with no thought of,
[02:09:31.060 --> 02:09:36.900]  oh, have some probiotics. It's just another bullshit con game. You don't need any of that
[02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:43.300]  shit. Compost, medical grade compost is all you need. If you have to clean yourself out,
[02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:48.820]  if you have to get rid of whatever's growing in you and you need an antibiotic, do it.
[02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:54.660]  How many people have had a toothache? If you don't take antibiotics, your jaw's going to
[02:09:54.660 --> 02:09:59.380]  swell up. If it's a top tooth, you're in real fucking trouble because the infection will move
[02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:05.380]  up into your brain. There are times that antibiotics are important, but you've got
[02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:10.180]  to re-inoculate after just like with fasting. Stop overusing them and know what to do to
[02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:17.700]  re-inoculate afterwards. It's on that same podcast, The Huberman, they talked about
[02:10:18.660 --> 02:10:24.260]  you don't really add a whole lot of diversity to our gut. Yeah, you can add these probiotic
[02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:29.620]  foods or supplements, which you should just eat probiotic foods and living foods that have living
[02:10:29.620 --> 02:10:35.940]  microbes on them and compost like we're saying. Oh, shoot, I got lost.
[02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:44.980]  That happens here. Just ask Brian. Normally, they're doing dabs though.
[02:10:45.460 --> 02:10:47.700]  Yeah, I was just about to say I didn't even spark this up yet.
[02:10:47.700 --> 02:10:51.460]  I'm doing little baby dabs today. I'm fasting and baby dabbing.
[02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:58.580]  I got it. You don't add too much diversity. That goes and shows how important the first three
[02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:05.380]  years of life is. That's the initial inoculation. Those microbes that you introduce your child to
[02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:10.660]  in the first three years of life are what they're going to have for the whole entire life. That's
[02:11:10.740 --> 02:11:16.740]  their toolbox that they're going to have to fight off disease and pests in the future.
[02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:24.740]  So much of this lifestyle, and God bless Kelly and Dragonfly Earth Medicine for opening my eyes to
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:30.100]  this, but it's helped me in my current life. My sister just had two kids in the past three years
[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:37.940]  and stuff. Realizing the importance of the inoculation and that we are a community of
[02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:43.460]  microbes and stuff. The difference between a vaginal birth and a C-section, that's the first
[02:11:43.460 --> 02:11:49.780]  inoculation passing through the birth canal. But then every single organism, every environment that
[02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:56.020]  that kid comes into contact with is so important. If they have access to pets in the house, if those
[02:11:56.020 --> 02:12:02.180]  pets are indoor, outdoor, these all contribute huge factors to how much diversity these kids
[02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:07.380]  are getting exposed to. It's more than just what you eat, it's what you absorb. Literally, just
[02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:16.580]  coming into contact with soil microbes has an impact on your gut microbiome. It's insane now,
[02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:21.140]  if you go to a hospital and you have a baby, the amount of stuff that they shoot them up with.
[02:12:22.420 --> 02:12:26.340]  And you don't even question it because you just want to be the good parent and you just want to
[02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:31.140]  do what's right for your baby. That's what the trusted doctor's saying. I don't know.
[02:12:32.100 --> 02:12:38.500]  I could go wild. I could go fucking wild here, people. But I'm going to bite my lip.
[02:12:40.100 --> 02:12:40.660]  Down boy.
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:50.100]  That first inoculant, the vaginal canal is critical to the baby.
[02:12:51.940 --> 02:12:52.980]  The womb is sterile.
[02:12:53.700 --> 02:13:03.140]  And they came up with C-sections as a way of improving humanity. No, it's to charge you more
[02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:11.060]  fucking money because if it's done right with a midwife, it's less dangerous. You're not being
[02:13:11.060 --> 02:13:17.700]  exposed to all of these horrible fucking microbes that happen, strep and all of this other shit in
[02:13:17.700 --> 02:13:23.540]  this hospital because they're so busy keeping it sterile. The first thing that comes back are the
[02:13:23.540 --> 02:13:30.820]  worst pathogen. So they create a pathogenetic environment to open you up and expose your body
[02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:35.940]  to this. Same as these huge grows that keep everything sterile, you know, and they're not,
[02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:39.620]  you know, clean in with EM or probiotics. And like, you're just creating the perfect
[02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:43.780]  environment, the perfect blank canvas for your pest to move right back in again. It's like
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:48.820]  such a joke to maintain this illusion of sterility. And like, instead of teaming with the good guys,
[02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:51.060]  it doesn't make any sense.
[02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:59.940]  Yeah. You know, again, it's, it's, it's just, it's a shame that we've allowed these doctors to
[02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:07.860]  control the way we birth and live instead of nutritionists and midwives and which doctors,
[02:14:08.660 --> 02:14:11.940]  herbologists, fucking herbologists are witch doctors.
[02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:16.740]  Anyway, don't have enough energy to freak out again.
[02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:21.620]  Yeah. And it's not to dispel all modern medicine. And, you know, like you're saying, there's a
[02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:26.020]  place for the antibiotics and everything. It's just the overuse and, you know,
[02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:31.460]  the lack of understanding of the microbiome is the, the real danger there.
[02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:38.900]  Agreed. You know, I think, I think if, if the medical industry was taught those key points
[02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:48.660]  about nutrition, endocannabinoid health, biological health, gut biome, if that was the forefront
[02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:56.180]  of what they were taught, they would not be prescribing a 10th of the fucking pharmaceuticals.
[02:14:57.140 --> 02:15:00.820]  But they're getting incentivized to prescribe those. And like, there's not a single
[02:15:00.820 --> 02:15:04.900]  pharmaceutical that doesn't disrupt the gut microbiome and like prevent us from healing
[02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:09.140]  ourselves in the future. So like the same thing that we're doing by dumbing down our soils,
[02:15:09.140 --> 02:15:12.580]  by feeding the plant directly and stuff, instead of relying on nutrient cycling,
[02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:18.100]  that's evolved for millions of years. You dumb down the soil, you dumb down your gut,
[02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:21.700]  you prevent yourself, you prevent your plants from healing themselves in the first place.
[02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:27.780]  Is that not the most insane thing that just rolled out of your, rolled out of your mouth?
[02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:36.500]  I mean, we think that our species in our arrogance, that we are better than nature
[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:42.260]  and, and humanity does. It's always been, Oh, we got to fight back nature. We got to beautify
[02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:47.300]  nature. We got to make it look nice and neat. Nature isn't fucking nice and neat. Look under
[02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:56.100]  a microscope. It's pretty fucking horrifying. Absolutely. It is truly all about the biology,
[02:15:56.100 --> 02:16:01.060]  guys. It's their world. Hey, does he have that on a shirt yet?
[02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:07.780]  Is that on Dag of Love? We need to talk to Peter about that. Yeah. We're talking about
[02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:12.100]  different merch to make for the cup and stuff, have stickers and shirts and posters or whatever,
[02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:17.940]  but inoculating minds, soils and guts or something like that. Inoculating minds,
[02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:24.340]  guts and soil since 2021. Another perfect one. It's all about the biology, man.
[02:16:26.980 --> 02:16:33.620]  I've been thinking about it, but I, I like to actually do, um, like a ham shirt and a ham hat.
[02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:39.460]  Exactly. You know, and, and make it really, and have it made in North America as well.
[02:16:39.460 --> 02:16:44.500]  Cause I like to support, you know, Canadian, you know, is there a Canadian option? I know
[02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:48.660]  all these hemp products are from Europe and shipped far, far. Like it blows my mind.
[02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:55.700]  I think we've got two manufacturers up in Canada, one in BC and one in Ontario.
[02:16:55.700 --> 02:17:01.620]  Like, do we not want to make money? Like Alpine hemp, that guy's here. I think Peter uses them.
[02:17:01.620 --> 02:17:06.500]  I think Alpine hemp made might've made that shirt. Uh, yeah, but it's made in China. If
[02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:10.980]  you look at the label and I wanted to kick Peter in the Easter for that one, you know,
[02:17:11.780 --> 02:17:17.460]  like I love to help. If you were to sell a hemp shirt in America, that'd be like 50 bucks,
[02:17:17.460 --> 02:17:24.580]  60 bucks. Nobody pays that. Well, the thing is, you know, actually people will, you know, it's,
[02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:29.460]  I've been buying hats like that for a long time. I don't see anybody else rocking. This is a hemp
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:33.860]  hat. It's quality weed. I don't care. It costs like a hundred and seven bucks.
[02:17:35.300 --> 02:17:40.420]  It's not about the volume that I sell. It's going to be about the message and people are buying the
[02:17:40.420 --> 02:17:47.780]  message and people will pay for that. And it's like buying quality weed from, you know, somebody
[02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:54.900]  that's growing with a living soil. I, I, I went to that event last night and I repped out FCP and
[02:17:54.900 --> 02:18:00.500]  save the turps. And there was only one guy there that brought living weed. And it was the only
[02:18:00.500 --> 02:18:07.300]  other weed I could smoke out of, you know, there was like 80 entries there from these, these LPs.
[02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:12.100]  And there was only one I could actually smoke because it was the only one with living soil.
[02:18:12.100 --> 02:18:17.220]  But anyway, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be interrupting the show. You guys get back. I'm learning here.
[02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:20.180]  Ken, before you go, who won?
[02:18:23.140 --> 02:18:27.540]  I'm actually, I'm waiting for the results to come in. Like I was actually sitting at the table
[02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:34.660]  with the people that won and it was a craft grow from the East side of Edmonton, but I want to
[02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:39.700]  actually have the results and then I'll post the results maybe on Chrissy's show or something.
[02:18:39.700 --> 02:18:48.340]  But yeah, it was, it was, and they love my weed because the Canada Grow group is actually about
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:55.780]  living soil. They're teaching a more of a kutz method of growing with the super soil. But yeah,
[02:18:55.780 --> 02:19:04.020]  I got recognized when I walked in from FCP and they watch FCP, they watch living soil. So,
[02:19:04.020 --> 02:19:08.740]  you know, thumbs up to those guys. They're, they're teaching people about living soil and I
[02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:14.580]  love it. But yeah, it was fun last night. First event I've ever been to and I had a hell of a
[02:19:14.580 --> 02:19:14.980]  good time.
[02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:20.340]  Awesome. Glad to hear it. Good luck to that. Good luck to the living soils grower.
[02:19:20.340 --> 02:19:20.660]  For sure.
[02:19:20.660 --> 02:19:21.220]  Yeah, I'm right.
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:26.640]  All right. Where do we leave off?
[02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:29.360]  Man, I'm not even sure.
[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:34.560]  We were kind of talking more gut biomes still. I was asking Alexis some questions.
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:37.280]  You want to talk about viruses?
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:44.560]  Oh yeah, real quick. I think I'm going to start like inoculating babies and compost extract,
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:47.520]  you know, like start offering that service.
[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:55.760]  You know what, dude? The thing about it is that nowadays these kids are being brought up
[02:19:56.560 --> 02:20:05.680]  in a bacterial war where they're being scrubbed with fucking antibacterial
[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:12.080]  soaps and hand sanitizers. We're going in the absolute wrong direction. These children should
[02:20:12.080 --> 02:20:18.880]  be required to play in the fucking mud and in the dirt. I mean, that's, that is after that birth,
[02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:25.840]  that is the next step to getting a healthy human beings, exposing them to all of the benefits and
[02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:31.600]  beneficial microbes that are living in the air and on the soil and in the plants. Nobody builds
[02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:38.400]  tree forests or runs around in the woods anymore. It's sad. I mean, that's why we're going to have
[02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:44.800]  more and more sick people because they don't have that chance to be exposed to those things.
[02:20:45.840 --> 02:20:51.120]  Bathing in compost extract, I think is a great idea. Or just take some and rub it on them.
[02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:55.840]  Exactly. When I'm flipping these hot piles, I'll crawl right in there and it's just a sauna.
[02:20:57.040 --> 02:20:57.760]  It's wonderful.
[02:20:58.400 --> 02:21:01.520]  It is. Anyway, go ahead, Alexa. Sorry about that.
[02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:14.560]  Oh yeah, no problem. Yeah, so you're just saying how these kids are all covered in sanitizer and
[02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:20.240]  we're basically, and everybody is taking antibiotics and we're basically just creating
[02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:29.760]  these massively resistant bacteria and stuff. But I've been listening to a lot of Zach Bush lately,
[02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:36.320]  and he talks a lot about viruses and how viruses are kind of just like a mechanism of
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:47.120]  communication between microorganisms and cells and things like that. So he says that, you know,
[02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:56.080]  viruses are needed for our continued adaptation on earth because basically when something's under
[02:21:56.080 --> 02:22:05.840]  stress, so like a bacteria is under stress, it's getting, you know, whatever, exposed to these
[02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:18.080]  antibacterial compounds. And so in response to that, it's exuding viruses, which are like,
[02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:27.520]  you know, DNA packets of information to try and obtain a gain of function to adapt to that
[02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:34.320]  extremely stressful environment for future generations. So it's just like,
[02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:46.080]  you know, when we get sick with one of these, it's just kind of like an adjustment to our genetic
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:55.520]  adaptation to the ever-increasing toxic environment that we're exposing ourselves to.
[02:22:56.480 --> 02:23:02.320]  You know, something else that I want to touch on viruses, it's being taught that viruses are not a
[02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:16.320]  lot. Like what? And it also is not being told that there are billions, trillions more viruses than
[02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:23.360]  there are bacteria. Every bacteria has potentially hundreds of thousands of viruses within it.
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:31.360]  And that those viruses are what steered life to end up with us. If there were no viruses,
[02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:37.680]  we would not be present. It's not talked about. You know, it's still being taught in school,
[02:23:37.680 --> 02:23:46.800]  viruses are dead. So, you know, that's, again, we've got to shift the power of flow of knowledge
[02:23:46.800 --> 02:23:52.720]  in a manner that's keeping up with the reality of what we do know, not this dogma that's been
[02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:59.840]  preached for, for eons. And so viruses are our friend. They're not our enemy.
[02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:01.920]  It's the next update, you know?
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:07.520]  Well put. Well put. The next fucking download or upload or whatever you want to call it.
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:13.920]  Yeah. And if you, you know, I don't know. It's a toughie subject for sure.
[02:24:14.880 --> 02:24:15.380]  Yeah.
[02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:20.880]  Talking about touchy subject. Did you see what happened to that, the Norton,
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:28.000]  or no, his McAfee? Like that dude's life? I saw a documentary on that like a few days ago. It
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.320]  made me think of that. But he like went off supposedly the deep end saying that he discovered
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:36.720]  a lot of stuff that I would say that Edward Snowden also talked about. Went to another
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:40.320]  country and then Epstein'd himself. Oh shit.
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:46.320]  Yeah. So if you're into like weird stuff like that, check out the John McAfee's.
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:49.360]  It's, it's worth watching. It's a pretty unique looking.
[02:24:53.770 --> 02:25:02.410]  Yeah. A big thing for me was like realizing that, you know, we have more bacteria cells than we do
[02:25:02.410 --> 02:25:13.290]  human cells. And like, we're mostly just a diverse ecosystem of organisms. And you know,
[02:25:14.490 --> 02:25:20.010]  our cells are kind of just like in this microbial floating around in this microbial
[02:25:20.010 --> 02:25:26.810]  universe within our bodies. And we're just like a symbiotic fusion of organisms. So like that
[02:25:26.810 --> 02:25:34.570]  understanding to me was like, okay, wow, like these things are extremely important here. And
[02:25:34.570 --> 02:25:37.530]  yeah. And who's in control? Right.
[02:25:41.530 --> 02:25:47.290]  Constant two-way communication between our brain and our gut at the vagus nerve. You know,
[02:25:47.290 --> 02:25:53.050]  they're constantly talking to each other. And it's true. Your gut is your second brain. And
[02:25:53.050 --> 02:25:59.450]  that's what's so important about, like I said, inoculating soils, guts, and minds, you know,
[02:25:59.450 --> 02:26:05.210]  like when you inoculate your gut and you eat probiotics and you eat, you know, living leaves
[02:26:05.210 --> 02:26:11.930]  that have the living endophytes inside of them, like you eat life, you start to think differently.
[02:26:11.930 --> 02:26:18.090]  And like, you have that gut intuition and like, it's so important to like nourish people's gut
[02:26:18.090 --> 02:26:23.130]  health and nourish, like give people nutrients as we're feeding them all this stuff, all this
[02:26:23.130 --> 02:26:28.250]  information, you know, it's like you heal your gut as you're learning all this new stuff. And like
[02:26:28.250 --> 02:26:33.610]  it goes hand in hand, I think. And another big fact that people don't understand either is your
[02:26:33.610 --> 02:26:40.650]  teeth. Your teeth actually send chemical signals down into your gut about what enzymes to start
[02:26:40.650 --> 02:26:46.090]  producing so that when it gets there, it can start absorbing it. That's new to me. Yeah.
[02:26:46.090 --> 02:26:51.130]  No, and it's, that's, you know, again, brush your teeth, take care of your teeth because they are
[02:26:51.130 --> 02:26:56.410]  so important, not just to mash it up, but to talk and communicate with the rest of your body.
[02:26:57.770 --> 02:27:04.010]  Well, yeah. Like I said, who's in charge? You really think you're in charge?
[02:27:07.370 --> 02:27:11.930]  I feel like if you want to see that, if you crave sugar, especially at night,
[02:27:12.490 --> 02:27:18.890]  then you have a yeast. Yeah. So if you want to see really who's in control, then starve them out
[02:27:18.890 --> 02:27:23.930]  and see that your brain really doesn't crave that stuff as much as you think like life has just
[02:27:23.930 --> 02:27:31.210]  become. If you take the steps to get rid of it. Yeah. It is a second brain. Yeah. Absolutely.
[02:27:35.290 --> 02:27:39.370]  All right. So you guys ready for some questions? Sure. I was going to say,
[02:27:39.450 --> 02:27:43.130]  it's probably a lot of questions today. Yeah. Oh, we got a couple.
[02:27:44.810 --> 02:27:49.530]  We'll start at the top and you guys can just work through them. How's that sound? Cool.
[02:27:55.670 --> 02:28:03.510]  You guys got to read them. Is it a good idea to add labs to plant ferment and let it soak for days?
[02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:13.430]  Yeah. So it depends on what ferment you're going for. If you're going to make,
[02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:21.750]  like if it's submerged underwater, then yeah, adding labs is an inoculant would be good.
[02:28:22.470 --> 02:28:29.110]  If you're doing like the FPGA or whatever, you wouldn't want to add additional water content.
[02:28:29.350 --> 02:28:35.190]  The labs are already on the leaf surface. I don't know if you guys have anything to add to that one.
[02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:40.630]  Well, that's a tricky one. It depends. It really depends on what are you going for? Yeah. What's
[02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:49.030]  your goal? I would say that would be an important thing to state. Otherwise, that question could be
[02:28:50.390 --> 02:28:56.310]  misinterpreted or misinformation could be provided. So, Green, ask it again in a different way.
[02:28:57.030 --> 02:29:02.550]  I do like adding when I'm making a ferment for myself or even like, so I've done a garlic honey
[02:29:02.550 --> 02:29:07.670]  ferment a couple of times now, which is delicious. And you just pour honey over garlic and let it
[02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:14.150]  ferment. But if you add a little bit of kombucha, which is labs, it's going to create that pH drop
[02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:20.630]  and it's going to make it even safer, faster. And so there's less of a time for competition in there.
[02:29:20.870 --> 02:29:28.150]  So there's ways that you can use labs and kombucha and stuff in your lacto-ferments.
[02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:36.150]  Kind of, even though the food that you're using has it on it, you can add a little bit of your
[02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:42.070]  mother culture or whatever to kind of get things going, add some diversity or whatever.
[02:29:42.470 --> 02:29:48.390]  Auditory and visual hallucinations. Yeah. Something, I mean, I don't know when you're
[02:29:48.390 --> 02:29:54.310]  like fermenting stuff and like making sauerkraut, something that Chandler told me to do is like,
[02:29:54.310 --> 02:30:03.030]  save the liquid from your sauerkraut and like to inoculate into future jars. So that was like a
[02:30:03.030 --> 02:30:11.670]  really... If you have any left, I'd love to drink them. After a workout and you've been sweating all
[02:30:11.670 --> 02:30:18.630]  day, working out at the farm, like come home and take a shot of your sauerkraut, Brian. Exactly
[02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:25.510]  what you need. Man, I'm all for it. You know, medicine sometimes doesn't taste... In my early
[02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:33.430]  twenties, I was shooting Jaeger and that definitely doesn't taste good. Yeah. There's a lot of truth
[02:30:33.430 --> 02:30:39.510]  to like pickle juice. Same thing. So Brian, if you have an upset stomach and you drink some of that
[02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:45.910]  stuff, it really helps a lot. For sure. And especially the, you know, actively fermented ones,
[02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:52.550]  pickles or any veggies, any lacto-ferment, thinking about it as, you know, a compost
[02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:57.910]  accelerant and thinking about your stomach as the bioreactor, as your compost pile, you know, like
[02:30:57.910 --> 02:31:05.750]  that's the process and like nutrient cycling for us. And so like, if you use these probiotics that,
[02:31:06.470 --> 02:31:11.910]  you know, just the sauerkraut that you're making, one, it's the probiotic microbes,
[02:31:11.910 --> 02:31:17.910]  but two, it's the prebiotic fibers that are going to feed those microbes. And like using that to
[02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:22.950]  inoculate all your non-fermented foods that you're eating, you know, as you eat it and treating it as
[02:31:22.950 --> 02:31:28.630]  a compost accelerant to, you know, make the whole process easier. It's just, I love these comparisons,
[02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:34.230]  you know, and thinking about your internal soil, basically, your gut.
[02:31:37.950 --> 02:31:42.350]  So, yeah, because that's what I was going to say, that's what I like to use lab for,
[02:31:42.350 --> 02:31:50.190]  like, anyways, is kind of just like throwing that onto like a cold compost pile to help speed up the
[02:31:50.190 --> 02:31:56.350]  decomposition of it. For sure. I just saw this new question here. It's been sitting there.
[02:31:56.430 --> 02:32:00.830]  I would almost say that's, it's almost too general because your tap water is like, where
[02:32:01.630 --> 02:32:06.030]  are you at? So that would be another one of those questions, kind of get a better,
[02:32:07.310 --> 02:32:11.790]  define it a little bit better for us. And I think we'd give you, we'd be able to give you a better
[02:32:11.790 --> 02:32:18.030]  answer. There's a lot of variables to that. For sure. Let's assume that it's city water.
[02:32:18.350 --> 02:32:26.190]  Yep. So any type of municipality with over 50 people tapping into that water source
[02:32:26.190 --> 02:32:31.390]  is required by law to add chlorine at the minimum. And more importantly,
[02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:38.670]  what's being pushed is chloramine. Chloramine is a combination of ammonia and chlorine together.
[02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:46.510]  They bond. I think it's a covalent, I might be wrong, but it's very, very strong, very hard to
[02:32:46.510 --> 02:32:51.870]  break down. The only thing that we've come up with to break it down is what's called organic
[02:32:51.870 --> 02:32:58.670]  matter. So when it comes in contact with organic matter, the chlorine can now gas off and the
[02:32:58.670 --> 02:33:06.430]  ammonia can now become a form of nitrogen that can be consumed by biology. So an interesting study
[02:33:06.430 --> 02:33:13.150]  done on all of the waterways or water systems in the United States, more often than not, they fail
[02:33:13.630 --> 02:33:19.470]  because of this one problem. They are taking water from a reservoir that has, guess what?
[02:33:19.470 --> 02:33:26.190]  Organic matter in it. And then they push it into the filtration system and pump it with chloramine.
[02:33:26.190 --> 02:33:32.430]  And by the time that water gets to the end user, depending on how far away from the source
[02:33:33.070 --> 02:33:39.870]  it is, it can have converted into secondary disinfected by-products, which are toxic to
[02:33:39.870 --> 02:33:46.350]  humans. So again, we've got huge issues with water and they're going to get worse and worse
[02:33:46.350 --> 02:33:53.150]  and worse. But if you're trying to prevent biocides from getting into your plants, into your
[02:33:53.150 --> 02:34:02.510]  into grow, I highly recommend you get some reputable humic acid, the TM7. I love Bob's BioAg's work.
[02:34:02.990 --> 02:34:09.390]  I trust him. He's been, he's been doing this a long time. Or you can make these yourself at home,
[02:34:09.390 --> 02:34:14.750]  people. All you have to do is take some compost, throw it in a bucket, take a cordless drill with
[02:34:14.750 --> 02:34:21.630]  a little mixer and carefully mix that compost up, drain off the solids. Guess what you got?
[02:34:22.190 --> 02:34:29.230]  Homemade humic acid. Damn, that easy. So abundant in worm castings. Yeah.
[02:34:29.230 --> 02:34:35.230]  Worm castings is another one. So any type of organic matter will break chloramine into ammonia.
[02:34:36.590 --> 02:34:42.670]  I didn't know that, man. I was going to write, that's a Jay-Z bar for me. That's a gold bar.
[02:34:42.670 --> 02:34:43.710]  That's huge for sure.
[02:34:44.670 --> 02:34:48.910]  And then I'm going to ask you this one, Brian, how do you collect your castings?
[02:34:49.630 --> 02:34:51.390]  I know it's a hundred gallons.
[02:34:52.990 --> 02:34:57.630]  Yeah. So I have these giant fish tanks that I'm using for dual purpose. Obviously one is
[02:34:57.630 --> 02:35:03.470]  breeding the feeder isopods and then two is, you know, building these giant soil systems.
[02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:08.190]  So once things have gone for a year, usually at that time, it's time to,
[02:35:08.190 --> 02:35:13.070]  you know, kind of rebuild everything anyway. Most of it has become worm castings. So I just
[02:35:13.870 --> 02:35:19.150]  move all of that, all of that top life into another fish tank for a moment. And then I'll
[02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:25.870]  scoop all of that stuff out, put it into, into buckets and just make sure that the moisture's
[02:35:25.870 --> 02:35:31.230]  there. And then I've been, for the most part, using that for myself. And all of that is now
[02:35:31.230 --> 02:35:38.270]  in the bins, building my isopods. So it's, in my opinion, it's almost all worm castings
[02:35:39.070 --> 02:35:43.790]  that I find success with for what I'm doing. If you're just growing in worm castings,
[02:35:43.790 --> 02:35:49.550]  that would be a huge no-no. So again, you know, plants need more diversity, I think, than just
[02:35:49.550 --> 02:35:54.910]  me playing around with bugs. But yeah, if you're really trying to get the worm castings as like a
[02:35:54.910 --> 02:35:59.630]  perpetual thing, there's this thing called the worm in that I used a long, long time ago.
[02:35:59.630 --> 02:36:04.670]  And all you got to do is put the food and stuff at top, it'll break down, the worms are in the
[02:36:04.670 --> 02:36:09.710]  middle, and then you can take off. It's like, just like this little drawstring kind of thing.
[02:36:10.350 --> 02:36:14.910]  And the castings will fall out for the most part. There is more organic matter. Yeah.
[02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:15.710]  Yeah. Okay.
[02:36:15.710 --> 02:36:19.550]  So I'm sure that, I'm sure somebody's probably improved that because it seemed pretty
[02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:22.990]  Sounds similar to the urban worm bag. That's another popular one.
[02:36:23.470 --> 02:36:24.990]  I'm sure there's a bunch out there. Yeah.
[02:36:25.550 --> 02:36:28.590]  That's like saying fabric pot or something, you know, there's so many different things.
[02:36:29.950 --> 02:36:34.510]  But I have found like using fabric pots when I'm not doing the giant things, I've found more
[02:36:34.510 --> 02:36:40.830]  success with the worm castings. And it's a lot easier to just kind of like dump out. I wouldn't
[02:36:40.830 --> 02:36:46.270]  say I've ever personally made like a pure castings like a commercial company would make because I
[02:36:46.270 --> 02:36:51.630]  always have a little bit of extra in there. I got more life in there. And again, it's for the most
[02:36:51.630 --> 02:36:56.750]  part, I use it for myself. So I just wanted everything to continue to be alive and as
[02:36:56.750 --> 02:37:02.110]  diverse as possible. So if you're really trying to get that on the next level, I would also use
[02:37:02.110 --> 02:37:08.110]  a cover crop instead of, you know, even grow, even if you use a worm bin, I would still maybe put a
[02:37:08.110 --> 02:37:11.710]  little light over it and grow a cover crop with it. The worms aren't going to come up because the
[02:37:11.710 --> 02:37:16.110]  lights on and boom, you're growing a cover crop, which is in my opinion, night and day difference
[02:37:16.110 --> 02:37:22.430]  again on when you're moving into the right direction of top worm cast farming. How would
[02:37:22.430 --> 02:37:26.910]  you say that? I don't think compost is complete without living plants in it. You know, like that's
[02:37:26.910 --> 02:37:32.350]  what closes the gap. And, you know, now it's not all just separate trophic breaking stuff down.
[02:37:32.350 --> 02:37:39.390]  Now it's, you know, let's bring some microbes conducive for life, you know, and all the enzymes
[02:37:39.390 --> 02:37:45.230]  and everything that those plants are producing and putting into the soil and just so much stuff comes
[02:37:46.110 --> 02:37:53.230]  from a seed popping or like from mycelium, from one mushroom popping off, like that can terraform
[02:37:53.230 --> 02:37:58.910]  a planet, like everything that comes from just a tiny little bit of life is absolutely amazing.
[02:38:00.270 --> 02:38:08.670]  So to answer this question, humic acid is generally made from two things, either lenedite,
[02:38:08.670 --> 02:38:16.030]  which is brown coal. It's not suitable for burning, but that is potentially millions,
[02:38:16.030 --> 02:38:23.790]  maybe hundreds of millions of years old, organic matter, compost. It's all it is. And the other way
[02:38:23.790 --> 02:38:30.750]  is through extraction of browns and decaying organic matter. Those are the two forms of humic
[02:38:30.750 --> 02:38:39.070]  acid. It's a very, very complex compound. I'd have to let Bob speak on that a little bit more
[02:38:39.070 --> 02:38:46.110]  because what we've learned is I think there's 1300 different individual components that make
[02:38:46.110 --> 02:38:54.430]  up humic acid. So it's very, very complex. It's, it's varies from, from different parts of the
[02:38:54.430 --> 02:39:00.110]  planet or wherever it's being mined. It varies tremendously. But is it shelf stable? Yes.
[02:39:00.750 --> 02:39:04.830]  Millions and billions of years old. I think you'll, I don't think you'll have a problem. Now,
[02:39:04.830 --> 02:39:09.870]  if you make it at home, what's going to happen is eventually the water is going to evaporate
[02:39:09.870 --> 02:39:15.470]  and you're going to end up with the sludge on the bottom. And here again, all you have to do is add
[02:39:15.470 --> 02:39:22.030]  water to it, stir it back up again. So yes, highly stable product. So do you know, I've only used
[02:39:22.030 --> 02:39:28.190]  dragonflies, brilliant black, and it's not very water soluble. It's a like hydrophobic, it stays
[02:39:28.190 --> 02:39:38.270]  on top. But I just recently made like an apple cider vinegar extract and did like one part humic
[02:39:38.270 --> 02:39:44.190]  acid at 10 parts homemade apple cider vinegar. And so now it's, you know, water soluble.
[02:39:44.190 --> 02:39:51.790]  It went right into suspension, right? Yeah, exactly. Typically, typically when the Lenodite is harvested,
[02:39:52.350 --> 02:40:00.510]  they use strong acids and bases to break it apart and make it water soluble. Okay. Bob at BioAg
[02:40:00.510 --> 02:40:06.270]  uses biology to do the work. It's kind of all this toxic fucking compounds.
[02:40:09.390 --> 02:40:13.950]  Chose not to do that process. And so it's like in the raw form. And that's why it's
[02:40:13.950 --> 02:40:20.430]  not soluble. You think? Exactly. So recently, I'm doing a Redwood restoration,
[02:40:20.430 --> 02:40:26.350]  Redwood Grove restoration. And the first thing I did was get Lenodite Spence. So you know,
[02:40:26.350 --> 02:40:32.830]  very, very fine particulate and spread that on the soil because guess what, it's compacted as fuck.
[02:40:32.830 --> 02:40:39.870]  So Lenodite is a wonderful product to soil soften. We have all talked about the value of humic acid
[02:40:39.870 --> 02:40:46.270]  as a key later. So making nutrients that are bound up available. It's also great biological food as
[02:40:46.270 --> 02:40:53.470]  well as a great product to help stabilize the packed soil and aerate so that the aggregates
[02:40:53.470 --> 02:40:59.390]  can form. So it's a wonder there. It's like so good. I mean, it makes even if you have chemistry
[02:40:59.390 --> 02:41:05.550]  out of balance in your soil or in your indoor grow and you apply humic acid, it makes everybody play
[02:41:05.550 --> 02:41:11.310]  nice. So you're not going to get nutrient lockout. So everybody should have some humic acid on hand
[02:41:11.310 --> 02:41:16.590]  as they're growing. For sure. All right. What you got, Ken?
[02:41:16.590 --> 02:41:21.070]  Kenji? Do you want to talk about biochar?
[02:41:22.510 --> 02:41:26.110]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, we could do that. How about removing—oh,
[02:41:26.110 --> 02:41:33.790]  I missed that one. Sorry, Ken. Dewormers. Oh, boy. That's another thing, you guys.
[02:41:33.870 --> 02:41:41.390]  Pet industry is not your friend. These bats are not our friends. They're selling us pharmaceuticals.
[02:41:41.950 --> 02:41:51.070]  If your horse is eating healthy foods, they do not need dewormers. The dewormers nowadays
[02:41:51.710 --> 02:41:58.350]  are a lot less or a lot easier broken down than the ones that were used, say, 10 years ago.
[02:41:59.150 --> 02:42:04.590]  And they're a nemesis, people. If you're applying horse manure to your soil system,
[02:42:04.590 --> 02:42:08.270]  you damn well better know what their horses are being fed and if they're getting hit with
[02:42:08.270 --> 02:42:13.710]  dewormer twice a year. And you definitely don't want to be collecting horse shit right after they
[02:42:13.710 --> 02:42:19.630]  got hit with a dewormer because you're going to put a nemesis in your soil. So there's my two
[02:42:19.630 --> 02:42:25.630]  cents on that. Anybody else want to chime in? No, it's definitely something to consider.
[02:42:25.630 --> 02:42:30.350]  Poultry manure, a lot of poultry, overuse of antibiotics in that industry.
[02:42:33.630 --> 02:42:39.470]  I think cows, not as much. But it's just all of this. It comes down to what they are eating.
[02:42:40.510 --> 02:42:46.350]  The feedstock is the biggest. And remember who owns that source.
[02:42:47.070 --> 02:42:49.870]  Yeah. They're not our friends.
[02:42:49.870 --> 02:42:56.030]  No, you're a farmer from where you're getting that material from. And then can you trust that
[02:42:56.030 --> 02:43:03.230]  person? I buy beef from a local farmer. I know I can trust him. You guys were going to talk about
[02:43:03.230 --> 02:43:08.190]  biochar. And that's a really good subject. And I think we should go there next instead of the
[02:43:08.190 --> 02:43:17.630]  questions. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Can I add one thing really quick to this? So, what was I going
[02:43:17.710 --> 02:43:28.750]  to say? Welcome to the crew, Alexa. Oh, my gosh. It was good. Oh, yes. Okay. Here we go. So,
[02:43:29.310 --> 02:43:39.150]  yeah. So I get horse manure for our compost piles. And that is something that I am concerned about is
[02:43:40.030 --> 02:43:45.390]  are they being fed antibiotics or dewormer? Or are they even eating things that have been
[02:43:45.390 --> 02:43:52.910]  sprayed with glyphosate or GMOs? And how is that affecting my compost? But I think that's
[02:43:55.710 --> 02:44:06.830]  a reason I really like to utilize the EM microbes and the labs and anaerobic microbes as well.
[02:44:06.830 --> 02:44:14.670]  Because they're really good at decomposing toxins and things like that. Exactly. Those PNSP,
[02:44:14.670 --> 02:44:19.390]  like we said, can feed off of those toxins. And so whenever you're looking for bioremediation,
[02:44:20.110 --> 02:44:26.270]  using the EM consortia is key because they thrive off of that shit. They'll turn it into
[02:44:26.270 --> 02:44:32.830]  useful stuff. And mushies too. Exactly. The first compound into things that are easily broken down
[02:44:32.830 --> 02:44:40.190]  by bacteria. For sure. So we're doing a lot of cool stuff, working on mycofiltration at Wormies
[02:44:40.190 --> 02:44:45.790]  and burlap and spent mushroom blocks. There's a whole lot you can do. Hang in that and some
[02:44:45.790 --> 02:44:52.270]  moving water and cleaning up some ecosystems. But also using EM in waterways and inoculating
[02:44:52.270 --> 02:45:00.110]  mud balls and mixing Bokashi with mud. And then you have this ball that you can throw into your
[02:45:00.110 --> 02:45:06.270]  pond, your river, wherever. And it's doing so much good stuff cleaning up the waterway. And
[02:45:06.510 --> 02:45:15.550]  if you grow fish indoors, rear fish or whatever it's called, using EM in your fish tanks is huge.
[02:45:15.550 --> 02:45:21.950]  And pretty much like all pets and like you got a litter box or something, it's great for odor
[02:45:21.950 --> 02:45:30.270]  control out in the barn. You know, compost piles, stinky compost piles, anything you spray EM on it.
[02:45:31.230 --> 02:45:35.550]  Don't forget cleaning. It's really good in cleaning. They use it a lot in India
[02:45:35.550 --> 02:45:42.270]  in their lavatories, public washrooms to clean with the EM1. That's awesome. That's all I use
[02:45:42.270 --> 02:45:48.030]  now to clean the house. And you can make it yourself like we talked about, but both SCD
[02:45:48.590 --> 02:45:56.030]  probiotics and Terraganics offer cleaning products. And they're basically just the,
[02:45:56.030 --> 02:46:02.670]  so like SCD does, it's just like EM with essential oils. And so it's more basic,
[02:46:02.670 --> 02:46:09.710]  but Terraganics has a product that has like vodka in it and as well as essential oils. And it seems
[02:46:09.710 --> 02:46:16.590]  more like EM5 that you'd use for like a pesticide on your plants with the vodka aspect. And so like
[02:46:16.590 --> 02:46:21.070]  this is something that I've been playing about. Instead of just using vodka, you can add a
[02:46:21.070 --> 02:46:26.510]  tincture. And so like I've been using like medicinal mushroom tinctures instead of just
[02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:32.510]  normal vodka at like integrated into my EM5, which if you're not familiar with EM5, it's EM
[02:46:33.150 --> 02:46:38.270]  and vodka, and you could use essential oils and you could look it up. There's an exact recipe, but
[02:46:39.870 --> 02:46:45.870]  it's a great like pesticide if you run into problems or whatever, preventative maintenance.
[02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:49.780]  And the answer is yes to that one.
[02:46:49.780 --> 02:46:52.580]  Oh yeah, definitely. Any aquatic system.
[02:46:54.740 --> 02:46:56.740]  Any manure, anything.
[02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:57.240]  Yeah.
[02:46:58.740 --> 02:47:01.140]  Dude, literally like anything.
[02:47:01.140 --> 02:47:07.620]  Do you think EM1 would work faster than Bokashi itself? Because like with Bokashi though,
[02:47:07.620 --> 02:47:08.900]  it'd go a little bit further, right?
[02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:09.400]  Yeah.
[02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:11.140]  Just drizzle it on the manure.
[02:47:11.380 --> 02:47:19.220]  That's the thing is when it's in that liquid, so Bokashi is just the shelf stable version
[02:47:20.420 --> 02:47:27.780]  in the dry form. And so like you use the EM to inoculate the bran and then you dry it out and
[02:47:27.780 --> 02:47:31.780]  that's Bokashi. And then you could just, it's shelf stable for like two years and you could
[02:47:31.780 --> 02:47:36.020]  just sprinkle that on anything and have the effects of the EM, but you're also feeding it
[02:47:36.020 --> 02:47:41.060]  the carbohydrate, the food source for it. And so they start to break down the grain that it's on,
[02:47:41.060 --> 02:47:47.460]  and then they spread out and look for other stuff and kickstart nutrient cycling and can add a lot
[02:47:47.460 --> 02:47:53.940]  of life to soil really fast. And so this is what's really cool about EM. I used to think,
[02:47:53.940 --> 02:47:59.620]  okay, so like, why would I buy EM that's made in a lab and it's only a couple of strains of
[02:47:59.620 --> 02:48:05.300]  bacteria or whatever, instead of culturing IMO, which I could do myself. And so like,
[02:48:05.300 --> 02:48:10.420]  I used to think of like EM like dumbing down and like just adding a basic form of stuff,
[02:48:10.420 --> 02:48:16.020]  but like that's not the case at all. Like it just acts as a food source for your IMO. And so like
[02:48:16.020 --> 02:48:22.900]  you can spray EM on a field every week and come back the next week and like look for it under
[02:48:22.900 --> 02:48:26.660]  the scope and you're not going to find it because it's all been cycled obviously. And so like,
[02:48:27.140 --> 02:48:35.140]  I don't know. It's pretty cool. I got sidetracked. Lane's going down.
[02:48:37.620 --> 02:48:39.460]  Oh, and Poe knocked it over.
[02:48:43.060 --> 02:48:44.820]  Poe wants to go for a walk soon.
[02:48:44.820 --> 02:48:46.820]  Oh, he's all about it right now.
[02:48:48.020 --> 02:48:54.420]  And so like you can, any of these dry amendments, any of these meals, they need to be cycled
[02:48:54.420 --> 02:48:58.100]  through biology before they're plant available. And so when you apply them to your soil, some of
[02:48:58.100 --> 02:49:04.580]  them are going to be ready for your plant for weeks or months in some cases. And when you
[02:49:04.580 --> 02:49:13.780]  ferment them first through, you can use just labs or you can use EM to ferment it. You're breaking
[02:49:13.780 --> 02:49:18.180]  it down. You're putting it through that biology and you're making a plant available water soluble.
[02:49:18.180 --> 02:49:23.540]  And so when you apply it, it's ready to go instead of needing to be cycled through the biology in
[02:49:23.540 --> 02:49:30.580]  your soil. You're using biology in this bucket instead and then unlocking all the minerals,
[02:49:31.380 --> 02:49:42.660]  adding probiotic bacteria and that's going to act as a food source, etc. But also, oh shit.
[02:49:46.100 --> 02:49:52.500]  You are, oh yeah, you're out competing any competition.
[02:49:53.060 --> 02:49:58.900]  And so like if there was risk of pathogens or contaminants on that dry amendment, now there isn't.
[02:49:59.700 --> 02:50:06.980]  Now it's safe to use. And so that's really cool. And if you ever have like something that is
[02:50:06.980 --> 02:50:14.420]  questionable, ferment it with the EM because the purple non-sulfur bacteria is going to eat up
[02:50:14.420 --> 02:50:21.940]  those toxins or whatever. And there you go. There's a gold nugget. Okay. Now, Alexa, you had
[02:50:21.940 --> 02:50:28.740]  a biochar question, I believe for Leighton. So let's get to that. Oh gosh. Okay. So honestly,
[02:50:28.740 --> 02:50:36.180]  I'm going to have Chandler more so talk about this because I'm not really the biochar expert,
[02:50:36.180 --> 02:50:40.420]  but I think it's really fascinating and I'd love to hear what Leighton has to say.
[02:50:40.660 --> 02:50:45.780]  I just saw another good question. That's bacterial hyphae. And so like, yeah, a lot of people say,
[02:50:46.420 --> 02:50:53.620]  oh, that's my mycelium from Bokashi and or from spraying EM. And so like mycelium is associated
[02:50:53.620 --> 02:51:00.980]  with fungi a lot, but like it can kind of be associated with just that network system. And so
[02:51:00.980 --> 02:51:06.740]  like if you have actinomycetes, which are bacteria, but they're filamentous and they're like, they
[02:51:07.700 --> 02:51:12.820]  take on the form that looks very similar to fungi. They take on like a mycelial network.
[02:51:12.820 --> 02:51:17.540]  Then you get a lot of confusion because people say, oh, look at this mycelium from my Bokashi.
[02:51:17.540 --> 02:51:24.740]  But it's like, why there's no fungi in there. We know it's EM and or we know it's lab and purple
[02:51:24.740 --> 02:51:31.140]  non-sulfur bacteria and yeast, you know, and you wouldn't see saprophytic like thick mushroom
[02:51:31.140 --> 02:51:37.700]  mycelium like right after you apply that you're seeing actinomycetes that are facultative
[02:51:37.700 --> 02:51:42.980]  anaerobes. And especially you'll see this, like if you put down Bokashi and then you put cover
[02:51:42.980 --> 02:51:47.700]  crop on top of it or you cover it with a paper or burlap sack or something, if you lift it up,
[02:51:47.700 --> 02:51:53.540]  you're going to have that thick bloom of mycelium. Is that accurate, Leighton?
[02:51:54.420 --> 02:52:00.820]  Spot on, dude. It's one of the biggest misconceptions. You know, both, both visually,
[02:52:00.820 --> 02:52:08.100]  you can look at compost and see the actinobacteria and people will call that mycelium. It's not,
[02:52:08.100 --> 02:52:15.700]  it's bacteria. So, and yeah, I'm witnessing under the microscope that stuff can grow crazy fast. So
[02:52:15.700 --> 02:52:22.020]  yes. And, and there's more, again, there's so much more to this shit that then meets the eye
[02:52:22.100 --> 02:52:28.660]  that we're, we're catching up and learning really quickly, like interaction between organisms. You
[02:52:28.660 --> 02:52:33.540]  know, you guys know that lichen is actually three different organisms living together.
[02:52:34.340 --> 02:52:39.140]  Exactly. And like, stop thinking of biology still in this isolationist mindset and start
[02:52:39.140 --> 02:52:44.660]  thinking about ecology and the interaction between everything because holy shit, does it get complex?
[02:52:45.460 --> 02:52:57.940]  All right. Biochar? Yeah. So we make it and we keep the ratio pretty, pretty low, but I know
[02:52:57.940 --> 02:53:04.820]  you've, you've warned people to kind of stay away or to like, just really make sure that you're not
[02:53:04.820 --> 02:53:10.180]  overusing it. And so like, I wanted to ask you, like what you recommend and what you think about
[02:53:10.180 --> 02:53:24.020]  biochar? So biochar is essentially a pure carbon source. So it's something that has value.
[02:53:26.820 --> 02:53:37.220]  And it is a good soil conditioner. Now, if you get above 20%, you start to have a disassociation
[02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:44.020]  um, between the plant and the biological community because the bacteria is just set up shop on the
[02:53:44.740 --> 02:53:50.580]  biochar. Why does it need to leave the house? Right. Yeah. Fucking, man. So, you know, that's
[02:53:50.580 --> 02:53:58.660]  why I warn people about, you know, keep it below 15%. And this is a one-on. This stuff is going to
[02:53:58.660 --> 02:54:04.820]  last for hundreds and hundreds of years. So, you know, I, I hear these farmers like, oh, we're
[02:54:04.820 --> 02:54:08.980]  going to put biochar on again this year. I'm like, all right, what you're doing is you're
[02:54:08.980 --> 02:54:15.940]  increasing your percentage. Be careful. So again, you know, I don't have issue with biochar. If there
[02:54:15.940 --> 02:54:22.260]  was a real issue with biochar, it's how it's made. Um, there's a tremendous amount of energy put into
[02:54:22.260 --> 02:54:28.180]  making biochar and especially if you're going to make a high grade biochar, you got to hit temp,
[02:54:28.820 --> 02:54:34.740]  and temp, it's very difficult to get there, you know, just burying a bunch of logs and on the
[02:54:34.740 --> 02:54:40.420]  ground and firing it up. Yeah. You can make biochar, but did you get to temp? Because that
[02:54:40.420 --> 02:54:45.940]  temperature, um, it's kind of like that expanded clay that you brought up. If you're going to get
[02:54:45.940 --> 02:54:52.420]  it to expand, you got to get to this incredibly high temperature. Exactly. And so there's an energy
[02:54:53.220 --> 02:54:59.300]  uh, credit or discredit there that, that, you know, again, if, if, if I was to be,
[02:55:00.340 --> 02:55:04.100]  if I was to promote biochar, I would be like collected out of forest fire,
[02:55:04.900 --> 02:55:11.460]  go, go somewhere and collected. Don't make it unless you have an energy source that is net
[02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:19.540]  zero and isn't going to, um, cause any more, uh, CO2 or gases, greenhouse gases to be admitted.
[02:55:19.540 --> 02:55:24.740]  For sure. So that's the thing. If you do it right, either in a kiln or in the conservative
[02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:32.740]  burn method, or, uh, we've done it at Wormy's, um, blast furnace. That's exactly, that's how we've
[02:55:32.740 --> 02:55:39.380]  done it. And basically it's, um, a metal cylinder inside of another bigger cylinder. And so you fill
[02:55:39.380 --> 02:55:43.140]  up the tea, a tea, a tea, a tea, a tea, a tea, a tea, a tea, a tea, a tea, a tea, a tea, a tea, a
[02:55:43.140 --> 02:55:50.100]  tea lad. Okay. Tealud. Yeah. Top, top load, down, draft. There we go. So I'm not totally
[02:55:50.100 --> 02:55:56.260]  familiar with all the terminology yet, but like, uh, we had part of the team kind of take care of
[02:55:56.260 --> 02:56:02.180]  all of this stuff and he did a wonderful job and ended up with like no smoke coming out of the top
[02:56:02.180 --> 02:56:08.020]  of it whatsoever because all the smoke in the interior one was going down through the bottom
[02:56:08.020 --> 02:56:11.460]  and out through flames in the exterior bin.
[02:56:11.460 --> 02:56:13.940]  And then, so like all the particles,
[02:56:13.940 --> 02:56:16.940]  all the contaminants or whatever were passing through that.
[02:56:16.940 --> 02:56:21.060]  And I don't know the exact science or whatever to it,
[02:56:21.060 --> 02:56:23.540]  but there's literally nothing coming out of the top.
[02:56:23.540 --> 02:56:26.180]  And then we ended up with beautiful,
[02:56:26.180 --> 02:56:29.980]  just pure carbon that sounds like glass.
[02:56:29.980 --> 02:56:32.460]  And so like, that's a great indicator when you drop it,
[02:56:32.460 --> 02:56:37.460]  it should just sound like pieces of like glass on the beach
[02:56:38.140 --> 02:56:38.980]  or whatever.
[02:56:38.980 --> 02:56:45.210]  And shouldn't have a whole lot of like residual oil
[02:56:45.210 --> 02:56:48.290]  or soot or anything on your finger after picking it up,
[02:56:48.290 --> 02:56:50.870]  but you want to, when it's still hot,
[02:56:50.870 --> 02:56:52.710]  you want to rapidly cool it down.
[02:56:52.710 --> 02:56:54.730]  And so like you're saying it expands it.
[02:56:54.730 --> 02:56:58.490]  And so basically you have like the silicone microchip
[02:56:58.490 --> 02:56:59.810]  is a great way to think about it.
[02:56:59.810 --> 02:57:04.170]  And you just wiped its memory clean by getting it that hot.
[02:57:04.170 --> 02:57:05.530]  And now it's expanded.
[02:57:05.530 --> 02:57:06.890]  It's got its pores open.
[02:57:06.890 --> 02:57:10.450]  You rapidly cool it down with the EM consortia.
[02:57:10.450 --> 02:57:13.170]  And like we said, the purple non-sulfur bacteria
[02:57:13.170 --> 02:57:15.570]  can thrive in volcanoes.
[02:57:15.570 --> 02:57:18.930]  And so you're sacrificing all the rest of the microbes,
[02:57:18.930 --> 02:57:22.850]  but that purple non-sulfur is still going to thrive
[02:57:22.850 --> 02:57:23.890]  in that environment.
[02:57:23.890 --> 02:57:28.770]  And like you're implanting all of this microbial DNA
[02:57:28.770 --> 02:57:33.770]  and information into this freshly wiped microchip.
[02:57:34.090 --> 02:57:36.170]  And so like after that,
[02:57:36.170 --> 02:57:39.130]  you keep on pouring more and more EM on it.
[02:57:39.130 --> 02:57:41.570]  And so like after it's cooled down enough,
[02:57:41.570 --> 02:57:45.210]  then microbes, living microbes can actually survive
[02:57:45.210 --> 02:57:46.030]  inside of that.
[02:57:46.030 --> 02:57:48.970]  And then it closes up the pore space
[02:57:48.970 --> 02:57:51.130]  and locks it inside of it.
[02:57:51.130 --> 02:57:54.930]  And so this is my understanding of it anyways, but.
[02:57:54.930 --> 02:57:57.970]  Well, and your understanding is really great, Jet.
[02:57:57.970 --> 02:58:01.490]  And the biggest part is the biological part
[02:58:01.490 --> 02:58:02.610]  that you're adding.
[02:58:02.610 --> 02:58:05.570]  Otherwise it's just charcoal, just burnt wood.
[02:58:05.570 --> 02:58:06.410]  Exactly.
[02:58:06.410 --> 02:58:07.770]  Until you add the biology in,
[02:58:07.770 --> 02:58:10.330]  then you're creating the biochar.
[02:58:10.330 --> 02:58:12.370]  It's the bioactivity.
[02:58:12.370 --> 02:58:14.570]  Yeah, it's imperative that you inoculate it
[02:58:14.570 --> 02:58:15.990]  because it is a sponge.
[02:58:15.990 --> 02:58:19.410]  And if you just put biochar into your field un-inoculated,
[02:58:19.410 --> 02:58:21.330]  it's going to suck up the microbes that are there
[02:58:21.330 --> 02:58:22.730]  and some of the nutrients that are there
[02:58:22.730 --> 02:58:24.930]  and it's gonna hold it there.
[02:58:24.930 --> 02:58:28.590]  But on the contrary, if you inoculate it beforehand,
[02:58:28.590 --> 02:58:30.570]  then it's gonna act like a sponge in the other way
[02:58:30.570 --> 02:58:33.610]  and just add good stuff leaching out of it.
[02:58:34.690 --> 02:58:38.130]  And the fact that it does hold nutrients there is key
[02:58:38.130 --> 02:58:40.330]  because it's gonna hold nutrients in your soil
[02:58:40.330 --> 02:58:43.050]  for years to come instead of leaching out
[02:58:43.050 --> 02:58:44.970]  when you have massive rain events.
[02:58:46.450 --> 02:58:48.890]  So we had a whole talk on biochar
[02:58:48.890 --> 02:58:51.930]  with Bart from Paonia Soil.
[02:58:51.930 --> 02:58:53.410]  And what he said he found,
[02:58:53.410 --> 02:58:55.890]  I mean, this guy's making soil by the truckloads
[02:58:55.890 --> 02:58:57.850]  and used to make biochar,
[02:58:57.850 --> 02:59:00.050]  is that the biochar over time
[02:59:00.050 --> 02:59:03.410]  only really allows the alphas to emerge on that little hotel
[02:59:03.410 --> 02:59:05.650]  that you put out into that soil system.
[02:59:05.650 --> 02:59:07.090]  So in his opinion,
[02:59:07.090 --> 02:59:10.130]  biochar is really only effective for diversity,
[02:59:10.130 --> 02:59:11.930]  maybe one to two years.
[02:59:11.930 --> 02:59:14.930]  I wanted to kind of see what you guys thoughts on that one.
[02:59:14.930 --> 02:59:16.950]  Oh, it's interesting for sure.
[02:59:16.950 --> 02:59:19.370]  And definitely not an expert,
[02:59:19.370 --> 02:59:21.750]  add it to my soil mix originally,
[02:59:21.750 --> 02:59:24.130]  about 15% and then that's that.
[02:59:24.130 --> 02:59:25.250]  I don't need to use it again,
[02:59:25.250 --> 02:59:27.890]  but there's all sorts of uses outside of the garden too
[02:59:27.890 --> 02:59:30.610]  for bioremediation and filtering
[02:59:30.610 --> 02:59:32.710]  and all sorts of cool stuff too.
[02:59:34.010 --> 02:59:36.770]  A lot of municipalities are starting to use it.
[02:59:36.770 --> 02:59:39.290]  And it's something that you can do with
[02:59:40.770 --> 02:59:44.650]  like byproducts from a lot of like industries.
[02:59:44.650 --> 02:59:47.610]  And so a lot of places you have like excess wood.
[02:59:47.610 --> 02:59:50.690]  And so if you have, okay.
[02:59:50.690 --> 02:59:54.750]  So have you guys ever seen the need to grow?
[02:59:56.250 --> 02:59:58.650]  That's a wonderful documentary
[02:59:58.650 --> 03:00:02.090]  and they have a biochar reactor
[03:00:02.090 --> 03:00:05.650]  and their byproduct from making biochar
[03:00:05.650 --> 03:00:09.130]  is free electricity for a hundred homes.
[03:00:09.130 --> 03:00:14.130]  And they grow algae inside of that.
[03:00:16.650 --> 03:00:17.530]  You gotta check it out.
[03:00:17.530 --> 03:00:19.090]  They call it the green dragon or whatever,
[03:00:19.090 --> 03:00:22.450]  but basically they grow the algae from the heat
[03:00:22.450 --> 03:00:26.770]  that's coming off of their furnace and whatnot,
[03:00:26.770 --> 03:00:29.970]  as well as putting energies to these homes.
[03:00:29.970 --> 03:00:31.330]  And then they use the algae,
[03:00:31.330 --> 03:00:35.450]  all those aquatic microbes to inoculate the biochar.
[03:00:35.450 --> 03:00:37.850]  And you have like this wonderful bio-stimulant
[03:00:37.850 --> 03:00:41.210]  and soil conditioner and like just that one-time application
[03:00:41.210 --> 03:00:44.330]  is so much wonder, but it's a pretty cool.
[03:00:44.330 --> 03:00:45.650]  And like it's in Montana
[03:00:45.650 --> 03:00:47.570]  and they have this tropical climate
[03:00:47.570 --> 03:00:49.490]  inside of this little greenhouse thing.
[03:00:49.490 --> 03:00:51.890]  It's like, then you can grow your pineapple
[03:00:51.890 --> 03:00:53.410]  and your tropical fruit and shit
[03:00:53.410 --> 03:00:55.050]  that has a huge carbon footprint
[03:00:55.050 --> 03:00:56.930]  and you don't have access to in the winter and stuff.
[03:00:56.930 --> 03:01:00.130]  And like, boom, off of making biochar.
[03:01:00.130 --> 03:01:04.130]  And so like, it's a great point that it is energy intensive
[03:01:04.130 --> 03:01:07.650]  and like even in like a good biochar burn,
[03:01:07.650 --> 03:01:10.090]  you're still only getting like 15%
[03:01:10.090 --> 03:01:12.290]  of that original wood material.
[03:01:12.290 --> 03:01:14.770]  And so like a lot of it is put off.
[03:01:14.770 --> 03:01:17.650]  And so if you have a way to capture that energy,
[03:01:17.650 --> 03:01:18.970]  holy shit, what a system.
[03:01:19.970 --> 03:01:20.810]  Hello.
[03:01:20.810 --> 03:01:25.730]  I just wanted to point out one thing guys.
[03:01:26.770 --> 03:01:28.410]  You're activated charcoal.
[03:01:28.410 --> 03:01:29.850]  That's something that you should have
[03:01:29.850 --> 03:01:32.770]  in your medicine cabinet at all times.
[03:01:32.770 --> 03:01:36.490]  If you eat something that is bad for you
[03:01:36.490 --> 03:01:39.930]  and you're having a major reaction internally,
[03:01:39.930 --> 03:01:43.290]  you take the charcoal and it will bind to that
[03:01:43.290 --> 03:01:44.650]  and pass it through your system.
[03:01:44.650 --> 03:01:47.130]  So it's something you should really have
[03:01:47.130 --> 03:01:48.850]  in your medicine cabinet as well.
[03:01:49.730 --> 03:01:50.570]  For sure.
[03:01:51.490 --> 03:01:52.330]  Thank you.
[03:01:54.370 --> 03:01:55.810]  You're welcome.
[03:01:55.810 --> 03:01:57.490]  And we hit fucking three hours.
[03:01:57.490 --> 03:01:58.330]  Can you believe it?
[03:01:58.330 --> 03:01:59.170]  Just like that?
[03:01:59.170 --> 03:02:00.010]  Wow.
[03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:03.490]  I still have 15 questions guys.
[03:02:03.490 --> 03:02:07.410]  I'm sure audience, these guys, they just love to talk.
[03:02:07.410 --> 03:02:08.250]  What can I say?
[03:02:08.250 --> 03:02:10.010]  There's bad news ladies.
[03:02:12.730 --> 03:02:15.290]  Was there any questions that was asked
[03:02:15.290 --> 03:02:18.370]  from multiple sources or are they all different?
[03:02:18.890 --> 03:02:19.890]  It's an open variety.
[03:02:19.890 --> 03:02:22.250]  I was just grabbing questions as they were coming up
[03:02:22.250 --> 03:02:23.330]  and storing them.
[03:02:24.530 --> 03:02:26.850]  But yeah, you guys covered a lot of stuff
[03:02:26.850 --> 03:02:28.530]  and it was fantastic.
[03:02:29.410 --> 03:02:33.850]  And like I know I tell you guys of the younger generation,
[03:02:33.850 --> 03:02:36.450]  you're our hope for us old guys.
[03:02:36.450 --> 03:02:39.330]  The knowledge that you're bringing out there
[03:02:39.330 --> 03:02:41.890]  and the understandings that you're having
[03:02:41.890 --> 03:02:43.530]  gives us old guys hope.
[03:02:43.530 --> 03:02:47.050]  That's where, you know, Layton asked you Alexa
[03:02:47.050 --> 03:02:49.410]  about, you know, how do you battle
[03:02:49.410 --> 03:02:52.450]  seeing this bad stuff all the time?
[03:02:52.450 --> 03:02:54.690]  It's because you go and you look at the good stuff
[03:02:54.690 --> 03:02:59.170]  because there is hope in understanding composting.
[03:02:59.170 --> 03:03:02.930]  We can take those extracts and we can make our planet
[03:03:02.930 --> 03:03:04.570]  into a Garden of Eden.
[03:03:04.570 --> 03:03:09.250]  Understanding compost, biology is the key.
[03:03:09.250 --> 03:03:10.970]  And that's beautiful that you guys-
[03:03:10.970 --> 03:03:11.810]  No, really?
[03:03:11.810 --> 03:03:12.650]  No.
[03:03:12.650 --> 03:03:13.490]  Who knew?
[03:03:13.490 --> 03:03:14.330]  Who knew?
[03:03:14.330 --> 03:03:16.690]  It's all the biology man.
[03:03:17.330 --> 03:03:18.650]  It's all about the biology, baby.
[03:03:18.650 --> 03:03:19.490]  Oh yeah.
[03:03:21.210 --> 03:03:22.970]  Okay, so I don't know you guys,
[03:03:22.970 --> 03:03:25.090]  if I don't know if Peter's in the background,
[03:03:25.090 --> 03:03:27.570]  if he has anything about shows coming up
[03:03:27.570 --> 03:03:31.570]  or Brian, Layton, do you guys have anything?
[03:03:31.570 --> 03:03:33.810]  Alexa, you guys, anything coming up
[03:03:33.810 --> 03:03:35.370]  that people should know about?
[03:03:37.890 --> 03:03:41.650]  Yeah, we're gonna be at the Divine Pine Gathering.
[03:03:41.650 --> 03:03:44.490]  I don't have the date on that, but it's a music festival
[03:03:44.530 --> 03:03:47.490]  and they're gonna have Skillshare, like workshops and stuff.
[03:03:47.490 --> 03:03:49.730]  Just like another really cool gathering
[03:03:49.730 --> 03:03:51.930]  of the Fahey people in Michigan.
[03:03:53.010 --> 03:03:55.810]  But again, I'm gonna plug the Michigan Compost Cup.
[03:03:55.810 --> 03:03:58.250]  I don't know if we ever gave a location,
[03:03:58.250 --> 03:04:01.290]  but it's up in Bel Air, up in Northern Michigan.
[03:04:01.290 --> 03:04:03.490]  And it's a bit of a drive, I'm not gonna lie,
[03:04:03.490 --> 03:04:05.690]  but it is just absolutely gorgeous up there.
[03:04:05.690 --> 03:04:09.130]  And like we said, camping out under the moon and stars.
[03:04:09.130 --> 03:04:12.450]  And we have nighttime walks with UV flashlights.
[03:04:12.490 --> 03:04:15.010]  There's bioluminescent mushrooms up there.
[03:04:15.010 --> 03:04:18.210]  And it's just like summer camp.
[03:04:18.210 --> 03:04:19.050]  Cool.
[03:04:19.050 --> 03:04:19.890]  Yeah, for sure.
[03:04:19.890 --> 03:04:22.050]  So come out to that September 9th through 11th.
[03:04:22.050 --> 03:04:25.410]  If you're not gonna make it, consider sponsoring us.
[03:04:25.410 --> 03:04:27.210]  You could hit us up on Instagram.
[03:04:27.210 --> 03:04:30.050]  Sponsorship money's gonna go towards a videographer.
[03:04:30.050 --> 03:04:32.490]  We're gonna record all the demos,
[03:04:32.490 --> 03:04:34.490]  edit it really nicely, put it on YouTube,
[03:04:34.490 --> 03:04:37.330]  and you can have your brand name, your logo
[03:04:38.370 --> 03:04:41.250]  in that YouTube video as credit for being sponsored.
[03:04:41.290 --> 03:04:43.490]  So that'd be much appreciated.
[03:04:43.490 --> 03:04:46.570]  But obviously, no pressure.
[03:04:46.570 --> 03:04:47.930]  There you go, Peter.
[03:04:47.930 --> 03:04:49.650]  Yeah, thank you guys so much
[03:04:49.650 --> 03:04:52.330]  for staying with us for three hours.
[03:04:52.330 --> 03:04:53.770]  This has been fun.
[03:04:53.770 --> 03:04:54.730]  Yeah, it was.
[03:04:54.730 --> 03:04:56.810]  I enjoyed chopping up with you again, Chandler.
[03:04:56.810 --> 03:04:58.850]  And it was a pleasure to meet you, Alexa.
[03:04:58.850 --> 03:05:00.930]  Pleasure to meet you as well.
[03:05:00.930 --> 03:05:02.970]  We're hopefully meeting you in person
[03:05:02.970 --> 03:05:04.490]  at some point in the future.
[03:05:04.490 --> 03:05:05.330]  Yeah.
[03:05:05.330 --> 03:05:09.730]  You guys are giving Ken and I hope.
[03:05:09.770 --> 03:05:11.770]  And I hope you know that's really important
[03:05:11.770 --> 03:05:13.610]  because we didn't got much hope left.
[03:05:14.970 --> 03:05:15.810]  I mean, it's a lot.
[03:05:15.810 --> 03:05:16.650]  We're working on it.
[03:05:16.650 --> 03:05:17.690]  We're working on it.
[03:05:18.810 --> 03:05:19.890]  So important to teach.
[03:05:19.890 --> 03:05:21.970]  And so thank you guys so much for,
[03:05:21.970 --> 03:05:24.410]  you've literally taught us both so much
[03:05:24.410 --> 03:05:27.290]  and opened us up to all this cool stuff
[03:05:27.290 --> 03:05:29.330]  and got us thinking for ourselves.
[03:05:29.330 --> 03:05:31.450]  And so now as we teach more people
[03:05:31.450 --> 03:05:33.650]  and inoculate more people,
[03:05:33.650 --> 03:05:35.690]  the people that we're teaching are gonna do stuff
[03:05:35.690 --> 03:05:37.690]  that's so much cooler than all of us.
[03:05:37.730 --> 03:05:40.650]  And so I'm like, that's where it's at.
[03:05:40.650 --> 03:05:42.930]  So thank you for cultivating this community
[03:05:42.930 --> 03:05:46.290]  based around educating and not hoarding knowledge
[03:05:46.290 --> 03:05:47.130]  and all that stuff.
[03:05:47.130 --> 03:05:47.970]  Amen.
[03:05:47.970 --> 03:05:50.490]  Like I tell people, listen to as many voices
[03:05:50.490 --> 03:05:53.650]  as you possibly can and make your own decisions.
[03:05:53.650 --> 03:05:56.570]  You have a brain, you know, start using it.
[03:05:57.610 --> 03:05:58.450]  Exactly.
[03:05:59.450 --> 03:06:01.010]  Okay, Leighton, you wanna count us out
[03:06:01.010 --> 03:06:03.090]  or Brian, you got something to say, brother?
[03:06:03.090 --> 03:06:06.290]  I just wanna say, I appreciate Alexi coming on back to back.
[03:06:06.330 --> 03:06:08.130]  I knew that was kind of like impromptu
[03:06:08.130 --> 03:06:09.770]  right there on the live,
[03:06:09.770 --> 03:06:11.890]  but we appreciate you making time for us
[03:06:11.890 --> 03:06:13.810]  and reaching out to Chandler.
[03:06:13.810 --> 03:06:16.610]  I know in time we'll bring on the Haifa Grow team
[03:06:16.610 --> 03:06:18.530]  so that we can talk more about living soil
[03:06:18.530 --> 03:06:20.770]  on a vertical growing side of things.
[03:06:20.770 --> 03:06:22.210]  I know that's always interested me
[03:06:22.210 --> 03:06:23.410]  because I haven't seen anybody
[03:06:23.410 --> 03:06:25.330]  really achieve success with it.
[03:06:25.330 --> 03:06:27.490]  So that'll be another one of those, yeah.

[03:07:24.490 --> 03:07:27.810]  that you need to use if you're gonna run biofuels
[03:07:27.810 --> 03:07:29.570]  in a diesel engine.
[03:07:29.570 --> 03:07:32.330]  I put personally on over a hundred thousand miles
[03:07:32.330 --> 03:07:34.810]  on a diesel engine using vegetable oil
[03:07:34.810 --> 03:07:38.890]  from the back end of a restaurant all over North America.
[03:07:38.890 --> 03:07:41.050]  But this is the technology that I used
[03:07:41.050 --> 03:07:42.530]  and the guy that created it.
[03:07:42.530 --> 03:07:47.530]  And that's Monday at 10 a.m. Pacific.
