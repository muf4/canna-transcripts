[00:02.170 --> 00:10.070]  Hello everyone, welcome to the East Bay Seed Collective show. I was talking
[00:10.070 --> 00:16.210]  where we have a guest, Doja, who's coming on, but apparently he just got kicked
[00:16.210 --> 00:27.070]  off right as we, ah here we go. Hey, I don't know, I don't know if that kicked me
[00:27.070 --> 00:33.510]  or something, it made me. Yeah, yeah it did, but we're back. Welcome to the show,
[00:33.510 --> 00:38.790]  Doja. I mean we can just continue on our conversation. Basically you are in
[00:38.790 --> 00:49.090]  Oklahoma, is that correct? Is that, that's where you are? Yes sir, southeast. And I mean we
[00:49.090 --> 00:56.710]  were just talking about how it's difficult to cultivate in
[00:56.710 --> 01:01.710]  Oklahoma due to the weather, so what's, how's this year been treating you?
[01:01.710 --> 01:12.470]  Sounds tough. I've had better years, but I've been, like I was telling you a little
[01:12.470 --> 01:26.390]  earlier, I've been fortunate enough to be where I was when I was a kid, so I've been taking care of things a lot, like over 110 degrees at times in
[01:26.390 --> 01:33.390]  July, that things don't, you know, they really don't want to grow, there being water, it
[01:33.390 --> 01:38.630]  seems like. So a lot of things have been studied, but all together everything's,
[01:38.630 --> 01:50.590]  everything's moving forward now, and things are fine, and I just,
[01:50.590 --> 02:18.510]  I just, I don't know, I, because of switching situations in the middle of the season, I didn't have any shape up for me. Do you want to maybe turn off your camera, just because you're still, you're still not very clear coming up?
[02:18.830 --> 02:42.910]  How do I turn off my camera? Oh, there should be an option for stop camera right next to mute. Maybe that will, because like halfway through what you, a little glitchy.
[02:42.910 --> 02:45.070]  And mute button.
[02:47.070 --> 02:48.470]  Yeah, right next to that should be stop.
[02:50.190 --> 02:50.750]  Oh, wait.
[03:02.160 --> 03:03.280]  Not seeing anything.
[03:09.900 --> 03:10.900]  Thank you.
[03:12.900 --> 03:29.900]  Yeah, it should be right next to the mute, should say stop cam. I mean, here, I can, let me see, I'll stop my cam right there. I don't know if you want to try talking with my camera turned off, see if that might help.
[03:29.900 --> 03:30.500]  Okay.
[03:36.180 --> 03:38.180]  Any better?
[03:40.180 --> 03:41.180]  Not particularly.
[03:43.180 --> 04:02.730]  Well, geez, we're trying to get Doja on, I guess he's gonna, he's gonna try to come back on. But yeah, welcome to East Bay Seed Collective show. We have Doja on as our guest today. He is in Oklahoma, and he's been doing a lot of work with the community.
[04:03.730 --> 04:24.730]  Basically, he's just been communicating with me the aches and pains of growing in, I guess you'd consider that the Midwest, and that it's mad hot and we know that he's having, you know, various difficulties and growing pains, learning how to grow in these super hot conditions.
[04:25.730 --> 04:35.730]  I definitely feel for him because like, um, I mean, when it gets above certain temperatures, I mean, the plants just don't really want to grow, they're, they're not really happy.
[04:36.730 --> 04:44.730]  And, yeah, I mean, I live in the Bay Area. So like, we went through one he wave where it was above 100 a few days.
[04:45.730 --> 04:57.730]  And yeah, I mean, I noticed that definitely like certain plants were wilting and the leaves just did not want to come back up to when you can come turgid again, like come, you know, back up, they were just really wilty.
[04:58.730 --> 05:08.730]  It was kind of interesting, you could see like through the plant, like you could really see all the way through it, there was not like much foliage.
[05:10.730 --> 05:21.730]  You know, and it's weird because like when the plants are wilting like that, it almost looks like you, it looks like you like over pruned your plants because you can like literally see through them.
[05:22.730 --> 05:33.730]  But yeah, I mean, it's just the heat. And I heard in Mendo it was like 118 that same weekend, it was like what two weeks ago.
[05:34.730 --> 05:38.730]  So, you know, you really got to feel for people in their gardens when they're like that.
[05:39.730 --> 05:48.730]  You know, also it's an issue because it's like it's so hot that you can't even really go out there and, you know, take care of your plants when it's like over 100 degrees and you need to stay inside.
[05:48.730 --> 05:52.730]  So that also like kind of becomes an issue and you know you can't spray.
[05:53.730 --> 06:12.730]  Oh, and here's another thing. So after that heatwave, I noticed that a lot of pests kind of began to take hold in my garden. So like this year I had spider mites under control, you know, quote no problem I thought it was not a problem at all.
[06:13.730 --> 06:22.730]  I was really feeling confident. And, you know, after that heatwave, I noticed in a lot of plants.
[06:23.730 --> 06:26.730]  Okay. Am I working now?
[06:27.730 --> 06:36.730]  Yeah, you're good. Yeah. Yeah, you're good. Um, so yeah, we're just talking about heat.
[06:36.730 --> 06:51.510]  You want doja? Oh, it's still great. Go for it. Yeah, start talking.
[06:53.510 --> 06:54.510]  Okay.
[06:55.510 --> 07:05.420]  Do you want to maybe turn off your screen?
[07:06.420 --> 07:08.420]  Yeah, I'm going to turn off my screen.
[07:09.420 --> 07:10.420]  Okay.
[07:10.420 --> 07:14.260]  Oh, it's still great. Go for it. Yeah, start talking.
[07:15.260 --> 07:16.260]  Okay.
[07:17.260 --> 07:18.260]  Okay.
[07:18.260 --> 07:41.660]  Can you try to turn off your, do you want to maybe turn off your screen?
[07:41.660 --> 07:47.580]  I think that might, are you able to find that, the stop mic or stop cam?
[07:47.580 --> 07:52.380]  I wish I could stop your cam for you.
[07:52.380 --> 08:07.680]  So basically stop cam, matrix mic, I know.
[08:07.680 --> 08:13.240]  It's hard, and it's hard to get people who live in the woods on the show, but I mean,
[08:13.240 --> 08:16.600]  that's what, I don't even know what's going on.
[08:16.600 --> 08:20.920]  There's like, yeah.
[08:20.920 --> 08:27.800]  So yeah, basically, so this person is saying damage control, removing dead roots, surgery.
[08:27.800 --> 08:37.160]  Yeah I mean the overwatering, I mean overwater when the heat is, device is not connected.
[08:37.160 --> 08:42.240]  You know like I was saying before, maybe like shade cloth would be pretty effective.
[08:42.240 --> 08:52.240]  I did a pot inside of a pot so that you can, they will need to connect their mic cam before
[08:52.240 --> 08:59.810]  you can add them.
[08:59.810 --> 09:03.050]  So I guess Doge is not on.
[09:03.050 --> 09:12.570]  Yeah, are you guys invited to?
[09:12.570 --> 09:16.930]  So yeah, I guess we'll just keep talking.
[09:16.930 --> 09:21.650]  So yeah, I mean the heat, I mean, after a certain amount of days, I really don't know
[09:21.650 --> 09:22.650]  like what you can do.
[09:22.650 --> 09:28.010]  I mean, Doge was talking about going into breeding instead of making flowers, which
[09:28.010 --> 09:31.530]  I think is a valid thing to do if you think the flowers just are not going to come out
[09:31.530 --> 09:34.130]  with the right terps.
[09:34.130 --> 09:42.170]  But I'm also curious how much those young seedlings will be able to.
[09:42.170 --> 09:46.250]  So it said you have to come on first with your screen on, then I'm assuming maybe at
[09:46.330 --> 09:54.160]  this point you can turn off your camera.
[09:54.160 --> 09:57.240]  You're breaking up.
[09:57.240 --> 10:06.800]  I was going to say, if you can turn off your camera now, now that you're on the screen,
[10:06.800 --> 10:12.040]  then let's see if that will clear it up so that you're not also streaming.
[10:12.040 --> 10:13.040]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:13.040 --> 10:14.040]  Okay.
[10:14.040 --> 10:15.040]  Okay, camera's off.
[10:15.040 --> 10:16.800]  Yeah, no, now you're good.
[10:16.800 --> 10:19.120]  I think it sounds a lot clearer too.
[10:20.120 --> 10:21.120]  Is that doing better?
[10:21.120 --> 10:23.360]  Yeah, no, this is great.
[10:23.360 --> 10:24.360]  This is great.
[10:24.360 --> 10:29.240]  It's just like every time it's clearer.
[10:29.240 --> 10:35.020]  Yeah, no, this is, this is better.
[10:35.020 --> 10:36.020]  Yeah.
[10:36.020 --> 10:37.020]  So, yeah.
[10:37.020 --> 10:47.940]  So what are you breeding with this year now, since you're not making flowers?
[10:47.940 --> 10:51.140]  Yeah.
[10:51.140 --> 10:58.140]  For me, I didn't have enough, I didn't have enough plants this year to basically make
[10:58.140 --> 10:59.420]  myself a head stash.
[10:59.420 --> 11:05.980]  So I decided I would take the ones that dealt really well with the climate and use them
[11:05.980 --> 11:14.500]  to make seeds and have something to kind of play with next year.
[11:14.500 --> 11:16.700]  What types of things did better than others?
[11:16.700 --> 11:18.700]  Am I coming through?
[11:18.700 --> 11:19.700]  Yeah.
[11:19.700 --> 11:21.700]  I think the ones that did well for you.
[11:21.700 --> 11:24.500]  Okay, cool.
[11:24.500 --> 11:29.940]  The Mexicans are thriving.
[11:29.940 --> 11:36.860]  Most of the land-raised stuff, the Mexicans, the Jamaicans, and the Indians are doing pretty
[11:36.860 --> 11:37.860]  well.
[11:37.860 --> 11:44.860]  The soils are not in this area.
[11:44.860 --> 11:50.660]  I kind of thought they might do a little better in that, but these were also plants
[11:50.660 --> 12:10.100]  that had issues from the beginning due to the climate or just too...
[12:10.100 --> 12:13.180]  And I mean, that still remains to...
[12:13.180 --> 12:14.660]  It's still got a long way to go.
[12:15.460 --> 12:22.420]  Most of those sativas are just now starting to flower.
[12:22.420 --> 12:25.140]  So are you there?
[12:25.140 --> 12:27.660]  Sorry if your image went away.
[12:27.660 --> 12:32.740]  Yeah, no, I just, I took it off just to see if it keeps going.
[12:32.740 --> 12:37.450]  So yeah, right on.
[12:37.450 --> 12:38.450]  Cool.
[12:38.450 --> 12:44.410]  So yeah, the land-raised primarily, you could almost just lump it into that kind of a group.
[12:44.410 --> 12:47.770]  The land-raises are doing well.
[12:47.770 --> 12:52.250]  And really everything has come back and started doing well.
[12:52.250 --> 13:01.730]  Like the nature farm stuff and the Kentucky red-haired skunk.
[13:01.730 --> 13:03.690]  A few things have been...
[13:03.690 --> 13:05.770]  I've had a few animal attacks.
[13:05.770 --> 13:07.890]  So I lost a couple of new berries.
[13:08.890 --> 13:14.570]  And they just went after all my stuff basically.
[13:14.570 --> 13:20.730]  And I had kind of a rough run with my first tray of clones.
[13:20.730 --> 13:24.210]  And so that was all my hybrids.
[13:24.210 --> 13:27.370]  Everything's rooting now, but it's all just the land-raised stuff.
[13:27.370 --> 13:37.170]  So I guess there's a lot of girdling I'm finding going on.
[13:37.850 --> 13:38.850]  We have these giant...
[13:38.850 --> 13:47.580]  Oh no, you cut out.
[13:47.580 --> 13:50.580]  You have these giant and then like we couldn't hear you.
[13:50.580 --> 14:07.940]  Did we lose him again?
[14:07.940 --> 14:08.940]  Gosh.
[14:08.940 --> 14:22.450]  We lost you, Marshall.
[14:22.450 --> 14:24.330]  So yeah, we were just talking about girdling.
[14:24.450 --> 14:31.330]  I mean, the Oklahoma outdoor environment seems quite difficult.
[14:31.330 --> 14:41.890]  And it's funny because at least in California, we mostly worry about sucking, rasping insects
[14:41.890 --> 14:45.410]  like broad mites, spider mites.
[14:45.410 --> 14:52.650]  But it seems like in places like Oklahoma, they have more like moving insects that will
[14:52.890 --> 14:58.170]  kind of like move in, eat some of your plant and then keep moving on.
[14:58.170 --> 15:09.130]  And a lot of those insects, you can't spray your plant to kill them because they keep
[15:09.130 --> 15:10.130]  moving along.
[15:10.130 --> 15:13.370]  They're not just always sitting on your plant.
[15:13.370 --> 15:19.410]  So you almost need like a physical barrier, like a greenhouse or shade, some kind of like
[15:19.410 --> 15:27.410]  physical something to keep them from like coming onto your plant.
[15:27.410 --> 15:32.650]  And I can't imagine like doing that outdoors in some kind of, you know, not traditional
[15:32.650 --> 15:34.330]  agricultural environment.
[15:34.330 --> 15:37.890]  That would be super difficult.
[15:37.890 --> 15:41.490]  Yeah, super difficult.
[15:41.490 --> 15:47.690]  So you really got to give Doja props for, you know, doing what sounds like quite a bit
[15:47.770 --> 15:49.770]  just to keep a garden alive.
[15:49.770 --> 15:55.250]  It really is kind of humbling because I mean, I'm in the Bay Area in Northern California.
[15:55.250 --> 16:00.530]  You know, we spray for spider mites, we spray for, you know, broad mites and caterpillars
[16:00.530 --> 16:01.530]  and stuff like that.
[16:01.530 --> 16:07.010]  But we don't really have to worry about like boring insects and, you know, locusts and
[16:07.010 --> 16:11.610]  grasshoppers coming and devouring our crop or like, you know, animals that are super
[16:11.610 --> 16:14.690]  thirsty nibbling at our stems or anything like that.
[16:14.690 --> 16:19.170]  So I'm pretty lucky in that we don't have a lot of those things.
[16:19.170 --> 16:24.290]  But I think it also really helps when you have like a substantial fence and like a nice
[16:24.290 --> 16:29.730]  yard and an area where it kind of keeps all the wild animals away.
[16:29.730 --> 16:36.530]  I know, shoot, this was a while back I was working in Mendo and we couldn't use any fish
[16:36.530 --> 16:43.210]  products because the bears would come and dig up your plants and like, you know, dig
[16:43.210 --> 16:45.250]  up all the fish stuff because they could smell it.
[16:45.250 --> 16:52.250]  And it was difficult because we couldn't use fish, we couldn't use like a lot of like crab
[16:52.250 --> 16:54.610]  or, you know, some ocean stuff.
[16:54.610 --> 16:58.170]  They also didn't really want to use like bone meals and things like that because they were
[16:58.170 --> 17:04.130]  worried that the bears were going to, you know, kind of like root them up.
[17:04.130 --> 17:09.050]  And so it really it makes it, it limits the different things that you can use.
[17:09.050 --> 17:16.570]  Especially if you're growing organically, you know, that limits the products that you
[17:16.570 --> 17:18.570]  can use even more.
[17:18.570 --> 17:21.290]  So it kind of like focuses on like essentially like plant-based.
[17:21.290 --> 17:29.130]  Major respect for all the outdoor American growers.
[17:29.130 --> 17:34.130]  Yeah, I mean, it's a major respect to all the growers period and all the outdoor people.
[17:34.130 --> 17:45.370]  And it's funny, like, we're almost like with outdoor growing, you know, a lot like I used
[17:45.370 --> 17:50.850]  to work at a hydro store and I used to teach, you know, teaching a cannabis cultivation
[17:50.850 --> 17:51.850]  class.
[17:51.850 --> 18:00.090]  And one of the really common things is I guess it's right around August, beginning of September,
[18:00.090 --> 18:17.620]  a lot of the new growers get fatigued and they kind of get over their garden, the plants
[18:17.620 --> 18:18.620]  start to stretch.
[18:18.620 --> 18:23.940]  They've been, you know, watching their plants since what, May, June, since May or April
[18:23.940 --> 18:24.940]  or May.
[18:24.940 --> 18:28.100]  So they're starting to get tired of growing their plants and they're kind of over it.
[18:28.100 --> 18:34.540]  Their plants are stretching, they're starting to get into issues.
[18:34.540 --> 18:38.060]  And it's very, very, very common for people at that point just to kind of be like, I'm
[18:38.060 --> 18:39.060]  over it.
[18:39.060 --> 18:40.460]  I'm tired of working with these plants.
[18:40.460 --> 18:42.900]  Their plants are just going into flower.
[18:42.900 --> 18:47.820]  And in reality, I mean, this is when the growth season almost is just getting going.
[18:47.820 --> 18:52.340]  Like this is when the most important parts really start happening is when the plants
[18:52.340 --> 18:55.300]  flower.
[18:55.300 --> 19:00.740]  And so, you know, one fix to that is for people to grow out of autoflowers and, you know,
[19:00.740 --> 19:04.460]  kind of occurred to me, I was like, well, that's a perfect application for autoflowers
[19:04.460 --> 19:11.140]  is for when you, you know, for people who are inexperienced and aren't really ready
[19:11.140 --> 19:19.060]  for like a whole long season of, you know, six plus months.
[19:19.060 --> 19:23.340]  So I don't know, where was I going with that?
[19:23.380 --> 19:30.660]  So yeah, I mean, really, you know, like the outdoor season is like a marathon.
[19:30.660 --> 19:35.420]  And you know, like, you'll see like a true marathon runner or like, let's say like a
[19:35.420 --> 19:41.700]  boxer or somebody who has to do 12 rounds, you know, like that's really what an outdoor
[19:41.700 --> 19:47.260]  growing season is like, you know, and so you have to, I mean, I guess you have to, you
[19:47.260 --> 19:52.620]  know, use different skills and strategies to time yourself properly so that you don't
[19:52.620 --> 19:59.860]  burn yourself out in, you know, June and July, which a lot of people do.
[19:59.860 --> 20:05.940]  You know, it's huge, huge rookie mistakes, you really have to pace yourself.
[20:05.940 --> 20:13.100]  So that essentially, I mean, now is kind of when the real game starts.
[20:13.100 --> 20:17.660]  You know, this is when, when your plants go into, you know, when your plants are edging,
[20:17.660 --> 20:21.980]  that's pretty much just like the size of your plants, the size and the shape, the yield
[20:21.980 --> 20:23.700]  of your plants.
[20:23.700 --> 20:29.620]  But when you, when your plants go into flower, that's really when, you know, you have to,
[20:29.620 --> 20:34.220]  you know, focus, you have to tie up all your branches, you have to make sure that you pay
[20:34.220 --> 20:37.340]  attention to the little details.
[20:37.340 --> 20:41.900]  Once you pay attention to those little, little details, it's still pretty smooth sailing
[20:41.900 --> 20:43.500]  the whole time.
[20:43.500 --> 20:48.300]  But it's just a very, very, very common thing for people to get overwhelmed with the amount
[20:48.300 --> 20:53.420]  of plants they have, the size of their plants, if they have an issue.
[20:53.420 --> 20:59.980]  This is very often when they start to come up is once, you know, your plants go into
[20:59.980 --> 21:00.980]  flower.
[21:00.980 --> 21:03.180]  So very, very common.
[21:03.180 --> 21:06.540]  People's plants are edging, they look beautiful.
[21:06.540 --> 21:10.540]  And I'll be like, hey, are you spraying for spider mites and broad mites and powdered
[21:10.540 --> 21:11.540]  mildew?
[21:11.540 --> 21:15.500]  And they're like, no, I'm not spraying, my plants look amazing.
[21:15.500 --> 21:20.940]  And you know, you don't really see anything, your plants start to get really big, and then
[21:20.940 --> 21:27.140]  they start to stretch, start to see little something, and then your plants go into flower,
[21:27.140 --> 21:30.940]  and then boom, you see the powder mildew, you see the spider mites.
[21:30.940 --> 21:37.660]  And people are super overwhelmed because the plants are now two to three times bigger than
[21:37.660 --> 21:39.420]  they were before.
[21:39.420 --> 21:47.100]  And so when you have these issues, it's much harder to get a full coverage of whatever
[21:47.100 --> 21:53.340]  you're choosing to spray with these plants.
[21:53.340 --> 21:59.740]  And at that point, your infestation is usually at a higher level, or your pest pressure is
[21:59.740 --> 22:01.700]  at a higher level than they were before.
[22:01.700 --> 22:09.340]  So it's going to take more energy to address that infestation.
[22:10.260 --> 22:13.540]  And so yeah, it's just very common for people at that point to get very overwhelmed, then
[22:13.540 --> 22:19.300]  they start to spray, you know, then they over, you know, they spray too much, or they're,
[22:19.300 --> 22:21.300]  you know, not fertilizing properly.
[22:21.300 --> 22:29.220]  And you know, all these things kind of can cascade into like a cluster fudge of, you
[22:29.220 --> 22:34.940]  know, plants that aren't pruned, that aren't staked up, you have infestation, and people
[22:34.940 --> 22:35.940]  are overwhelmed.
[22:36.260 --> 22:40.500]  And it's sad, because I mean, really, there's not much you can do that year.
[22:40.500 --> 22:45.220]  I mean, yeah, you can kind of fight to make it to keep it as good as possible.
[22:45.220 --> 22:51.420]  But you know, essentially, the battle is, it's not lost, but it's going to be a lot
[22:51.420 --> 22:56.420]  of work for you to, it's going to be a lot of work.
[22:56.420 --> 23:05.860]  And you know, it also is overwhelming to people to do this type of work, because you
[23:05.860 --> 23:11.380]  know, people don't know when to spray, people don't know when to fertilize, they don't know,
[23:11.380 --> 23:17.020]  you know, if it's a hot day, how hot can it be that I can spray?
[23:17.020 --> 23:21.020]  You know, people don't know certain products you can spray in the hot sun and certain products
[23:21.020 --> 23:22.940]  you cannot.
[23:23.940 --> 23:27.140]  And you know, those are really important things to be aware of.
[23:27.140 --> 23:31.580]  And very often, the only way that you can truly know is by kind of screwing up.
[23:31.580 --> 23:33.500]  So let's just kind of go over that real quickly.
[23:33.500 --> 23:42.380]  So for caterpillars, we would want to spray, we would, British tea, we want to spray BT.
[23:42.380 --> 23:45.500]  And hey, welcome back.
[23:45.500 --> 23:48.380]  And the, yeah, no worries.
[23:48.380 --> 23:49.620]  And the BT is a bacteria.
[23:49.660 --> 23:54.340]  So like the bacteria is we spray pretty much any time we don't want to spray when it's
[23:54.340 --> 23:56.460]  mad hot, but we can spray them whenever.
[23:56.460 --> 24:00.140]  And that will really help our plants fight against caterpillars.
[24:00.140 --> 24:04.220]  Now when we're spraying with oils, so that would be like plant therapy, neem oil, any
[24:04.220 --> 24:10.860]  of those things you do want to be more aware of when you're spraying, spray in the evening
[24:10.860 --> 24:14.060]  is not mad, mad hot.
[24:14.060 --> 24:20.380]  Something super important that you should always do is do a test leaf spray.
[24:20.380 --> 24:24.460]  And basically if you know, you use a new product or you're in a new environment, you spray
[24:24.460 --> 24:29.380]  one leaf or like a section of a plant and then wait a couple of days and see what happens.
[24:29.380 --> 24:33.100]  And it's really effective because you can see if you screwed that plant up, you burned
[24:33.100 --> 24:35.180]  it, you know that you burned it.
[24:35.180 --> 24:39.100]  But if you sprayed it and it's cool, then you know, okay, that's good.
[24:39.100 --> 24:43.980]  And honestly, with a lot of pesticides, you want to be able to use as high concentration
[24:44.900 --> 24:48.220]  as possible without damaging the plant.
[24:48.220 --> 24:52.460]  And of course, that's within reason, but products like plant therapy, I don't know if you're
[24:52.460 --> 24:58.900]  familiar with that one, Doja, but like it has a very wide application range.
[24:58.900 --> 25:05.300]  So they have like a range for maintenance and they have a range for if you have an infestation.
[25:05.300 --> 25:09.700]  And so the infestation rate is basically twice as much as the maintenance.
[25:10.700 --> 25:16.460]  And you know, what you want to do is you do, if you have a seed of infestation, you spray
[25:16.460 --> 25:21.780]  your test leaf with potency and then wait a day and see what happens.
[25:21.780 --> 25:24.300]  If that leaf shrivels up, you know, that's too hot.
[25:24.300 --> 25:26.260]  It's too much of a concentration.
[25:26.260 --> 25:30.420]  If it doesn't, you know, that's the good concentration to spray your plant with.
[25:30.420 --> 25:36.500]  It really, regardless of what the pesticide is, I would really urge people to do that
[25:36.740 --> 25:40.180]  because most pesticides or many pesticides will have a range.
[25:40.180 --> 25:44.060]  They'll have like a maintenance and infestation range.
[25:44.060 --> 25:47.540]  And you want to be able to navigate in between that.
[25:47.540 --> 25:54.940]  Also certain varieties will handle that, will handle that pesticide differently.
[25:54.940 --> 26:00.940]  Often plants that have a really big root system, I find also it's the ones that can handle
[26:00.980 --> 26:06.700]  the heat a little bit more can often handle more oils put on them.
[26:08.820 --> 26:13.100]  So, you know, during this time of the year, I'm sure there's people in here, you know,
[26:13.100 --> 26:16.940]  on the chat who have spider mites in their plants and are just trying to figure out what
[26:16.940 --> 26:25.020]  to do. I mean, you do need to spray, you do need to address these plants so that they
[26:25.020 --> 26:27.180]  will, that they can finish.
[26:27.260 --> 26:32.780]  And, you know, basically, yes, you can, you know, can you spray your plants during flower?
[26:32.780 --> 26:33.580]  Yes, you can.
[26:36.460 --> 26:38.460]  I mean, will you have IPM turps?
[26:38.780 --> 26:41.460]  I mean, I'd say that's a very that's up for debate.
[26:41.460 --> 26:45.820]  I mean, you know, like you can spray plants pretty close to harvest.
[26:45.820 --> 26:51.900]  And if the sun is breaking down those molecules, they theoretically should not be there.
[26:52.380 --> 27:00.940]  Plus, if the plant is also being dried, that's also time for those molecules to break down.
[27:00.940 --> 27:02.700]  So it depends what you're spraying.
[27:02.700 --> 27:06.460]  If you're spraying Avid on your plants, obviously, no, it's not going to break down.
[27:06.460 --> 27:07.580]  You're going to be smoking Avid.
[27:07.580 --> 27:09.100]  It's all it's all bad.
[27:09.100 --> 27:12.700]  But if you're smoking things, you know, if you're spraying things like plant therapy,
[27:12.700 --> 27:21.420]  green cleaner that are cinnamon oils or like rosemary oil type products from Dr. Zimes.
[27:21.420 --> 27:27.020]  I mean, yeah, like from my personal experience, people don't say that they taste pesticides
[27:27.020 --> 27:28.300]  and like cannabis.
[27:28.300 --> 27:31.260]  And, you know, on occasion, plants do need to be sprayed.
[27:32.060 --> 27:32.540]  Let's say.
[27:35.500 --> 27:36.000]  Sorry, what?
[27:38.140 --> 27:42.940]  I could kind of notice it when smoking something that was sprayed with trifecta.
[27:44.060 --> 27:44.560]  Okay.
[27:45.100 --> 27:48.380]  I think that's supposed to be an organic one or whatever, but I'm not sure.
[27:49.260 --> 27:50.860]  How late into flower?
[27:50.860 --> 27:51.580]  Was it sprayed?
[27:53.180 --> 27:59.020]  It was in an industry warehouse, so probably all the way up to the last week.
[27:59.020 --> 27:59.520]  Okay.
[28:00.140 --> 28:03.260]  It's never a good idea anyway, even if it can be sprayed.
[28:03.260 --> 28:08.140]  Usually it's nice to give it a week or two to not be sprayed.
[28:08.140 --> 28:08.940]  I feel like.
[28:10.460 --> 28:11.660]  You know, like it's like.
[28:12.620 --> 28:13.420]  Sometimes you can.
[28:15.500 --> 28:19.180]  Yeah, I mean, it's like there's, you know, there are purists who are like,
[28:19.180 --> 28:21.500]  no, I don't spray anything on my plants.
[28:21.500 --> 28:23.260]  And then there's everything in between.
[28:25.660 --> 28:26.540]  You know, it's like.
[28:28.060 --> 28:34.140]  Do you want to smoke powder mildew or would you rather be smoking rosemary oil?
[28:35.180 --> 28:35.680]  Right.
[28:37.020 --> 28:41.260]  You know, or caterpillar poop, because for sure there's tons of caterpillar poop and
[28:41.260 --> 28:42.860]  outdoor weed, especially in California.
[28:43.420 --> 28:49.260]  You definitely got to still search for them though, because even if you spray BT and it
[28:49.260 --> 28:53.260]  kills them, you're still going to have a shriveled up caterpillar inside your bud
[28:53.260 --> 28:56.300]  if you don't find them most of the time.
[28:56.300 --> 28:58.540]  Sometimes you find them on the leaves and stuff.
[28:59.100 --> 28:59.820]  No, for sure.
[28:59.820 --> 29:03.020]  And I mean, I was even going to bring up another issue, which I thought about is like,
[29:03.660 --> 29:09.660]  if you're adding predators to your garden, they're still going to be.
[29:09.660 --> 29:11.660]  They'll still be pooping in your garden.
[29:13.740 --> 29:14.240]  Mm hmm.
[29:14.780 --> 29:18.700]  So you'll still have feces of the predator bugs in your garden as well.
[29:20.140 --> 29:23.420]  As well as even just their
[29:25.500 --> 29:29.980]  carcasses and whatnot, like when they eventually die too, you know what I mean?
[29:30.940 --> 29:35.580]  Because you don't want to have them crawling on everything at harvest or anything.
[29:35.580 --> 29:38.140]  So you got to you got to let them do their job and die off.
[29:38.220 --> 29:43.580]  And then, you know, unless they they all swarm to a totally different
[29:44.140 --> 29:47.660]  plant or something in their final days, which we all know never happens.
[29:49.740 --> 29:54.380]  Yeah, you know, there's that too, which I've always been kind of curious about.
[29:55.100 --> 29:58.620]  And I mean, what's up?
[29:58.620 --> 29:59.500]  No, keep going, please.
[30:00.380 --> 30:06.620]  I was just gonna say, I'm not personally a fan of like dunking my flowers afterwards.
[30:07.420 --> 30:12.540]  And I understand if they've been heavily sprayed or I don't know, even
[30:14.220 --> 30:17.740]  like out in Cali with the fires, if they get a lot of smoke on them or something,
[30:17.740 --> 30:21.260]  I can understand if you have a heavy concentration of airborne
[30:22.220 --> 30:24.060]  problems to dunk with or something.
[30:24.060 --> 30:30.780]  But like, yeah, if I'm just using natural sprays and maybe predator mites,
[30:30.780 --> 30:35.820]  I really don't want to have to go and dunk my flowers in something to get them off of it.
[30:36.700 --> 30:45.180]  And potentially potentially ruin some of the quality of that flower in my experience.
[30:46.940 --> 30:47.740]  So you feel like.
[30:49.580 --> 30:50.460]  Let's jump into it.
[30:50.460 --> 30:54.220]  So you feel that that washing the buds does degrade the quality?
[30:55.900 --> 31:03.740]  I mean, I just never I've never had a flower get like, like once it's been cut,
[31:03.740 --> 31:04.540]  you know what I mean?
[31:04.540 --> 31:09.660]  Get exposed to water and then dry out the same quality it was.
[31:10.540 --> 31:13.660]  I don't have any science behind that or anything.
[31:13.660 --> 31:15.100]  It's just been my experience.
[31:15.900 --> 31:24.380]  But yeah, like I've followed also a good bit of that conversation with other people who,
[31:24.380 --> 31:27.580]  you know, have more experience with that than I do.
[31:27.580 --> 31:30.540]  And they kind of discuss it amongst themselves.
[31:31.500 --> 31:39.740]  And yeah, you know, I tend to feel like the people that don't don't like to do that
[31:40.380 --> 31:42.620]  seem to have about the same opinion as me.
[31:43.260 --> 31:47.820]  And so I even though I haven't really experimented too much with it, I have a little bit.
[31:50.220 --> 31:56.620]  Yeah, I think that when it's just since I'm growing outdoors and stuff and it's just
[31:57.580 --> 32:03.340]  the same stuff that's, you know, blowing around, I'm walking around in it and stuff.
[32:03.340 --> 32:07.580]  I just don't feel like, you know, there's anything that bad in the air that
[32:09.340 --> 32:13.180]  I need to risk the end quality of the flowers for.
[32:13.180 --> 32:17.980]  But if there was a I mean, I don't think it's the intention behind it.
[32:17.980 --> 32:19.900]  I don't think there's anything wrong with that at all.
[32:19.900 --> 32:22.860]  And if they, you know, someone comes up with a way that it really,
[32:23.260 --> 32:30.540]  really does work and doesn't harm the flower, then that's one thing, because I can definitely
[32:30.540 --> 32:35.260]  say when you're making hash, you know, if you wash as long as you have a pump sprayer
[32:35.260 --> 32:41.980]  and you can wash through your catch on each screen, that that can do amazing things to
[32:41.980 --> 32:44.460]  the quality of your your bubble hash.
[32:44.460 --> 32:46.300]  So, you know what I mean?
[32:46.300 --> 32:51.820]  It's not to say that those impurities that can kind of get on your flowers don't
[32:52.460 --> 32:56.060]  affect anything, but that's really because they're so small,
[32:56.060 --> 33:00.140]  attaching to something else is very small that you're putting in a concentrated form.
[33:00.700 --> 33:04.540]  I feel like when it's a flower, you don't quite notice it so much.
[33:04.540 --> 33:12.380]  So from my experience, I've done both and I noticed like a side by side difference.
[33:13.500 --> 33:13.740]  Yeah.
[33:14.700 --> 33:19.420]  What I did notice is there was definitely dirt in the water, which I like to see,
[33:19.420 --> 33:19.980]  you know what I mean?
[33:20.060 --> 33:21.580]  Because I'm like, OK, that's not mud.
[33:23.420 --> 33:25.820]  But I also saw like an oil layer.
[33:27.100 --> 33:27.340]  Oh.
[33:28.540 --> 33:32.220]  And the oil layer kind of like oil and water, you know what I mean?
[33:32.220 --> 33:37.420]  Like that shiny type of stuff, you know, to me, I'm like, is that terpenes?
[33:42.140 --> 33:46.940]  You'd have to look into the solubility of terpenes because if they are oils,
[33:46.940 --> 33:49.100]  which are well, we know they are oils.
[33:49.660 --> 33:57.020]  So like, I could imagine it is if it's surface ones, if it'll come right off on your fingers,
[33:57.900 --> 34:02.940]  there's probably, you know, it's not like it's necessarily taking a substantial portion of them
[34:02.940 --> 34:09.260]  out, but it's either that or broken trichomes or residue from an oil based spray.
[34:09.260 --> 34:09.500]  Right.
[34:09.500 --> 34:13.020]  And I mean, I don't think it was an oil based spray because I mean,
[34:13.820 --> 34:16.780]  you know, those plants were not sprayed super late in the flower.
[34:19.100 --> 34:23.100]  I wonder if washing your plants in ice water.
[34:25.180 --> 34:32.860]  Might be a good way of stripping less of the, you know, the volatile terpenes off, you know?
[34:34.060 --> 34:37.820]  It might then take the trichomes off.
[34:37.820 --> 34:40.940]  Just because that's when you're making bubble hash, it makes them rigid.
[34:41.500 --> 34:43.340]  So they might snap off.
[34:44.060 --> 34:47.820]  Yeah, I mean, I think it with it being, you know, just like a quick dunk,
[34:48.540 --> 34:50.940]  I feel confident that I wouldn't have to worry about that.
[34:51.900 --> 34:59.580]  Oh, and then also another reason that I actually do wash, dunk my buds is when you're drying and
[34:59.580 --> 35:05.980]  not ideal drying conditions. So the facility that's really dry and that's really hot.
[35:07.740 --> 35:10.540]  Like Colorado spot or something.
[35:10.700 --> 35:16.140]  Or even in California, even in California, because like often it's really, really dry in October.
[35:16.140 --> 35:17.580]  Really, really, really dry.
[35:18.860 --> 35:24.300]  And so I figured, you know, I figured might as well dunk them in water
[35:24.300 --> 35:29.100]  to give them this that extra coating of moisture to protect everything.
[35:30.380 --> 35:34.060]  And, you know, in the case of an arid environment, that's actually,
[35:35.340 --> 35:39.500]  you know, that's a good idea. Or you could maybe mist them or something.
[35:40.460 --> 35:45.420]  But if the dunking, like I said, if it doesn't hurt them and it does clean them
[35:45.420 --> 35:50.220]  and you don't feel that it hurts the quality of it, then like that's actually that's a good
[35:51.660 --> 35:55.260]  strategy or start of one for an arid climate.
[35:55.820 --> 36:00.060]  And, you know, it's like, it's like, does it maybe pull off terpenes? Possibly.
[36:00.060 --> 36:06.700]  But also does drying your material in these super hot conditions that also degrades the material.
[36:06.700 --> 36:13.180]  So it's like, you know, a lot of yeah, it's like a lot of us don't have perfect conditions.
[36:13.820 --> 36:18.220]  And, you know, a lot of what we're doing is trying to like do this stuff in unperfect conditions.
[36:18.220 --> 36:21.820]  Right. Yes. Making it work.
[36:21.820 --> 36:24.460]  Yeah. Trying to make it work. And so like another thing.
[36:24.460 --> 36:29.020]  So I guess if we're sharing on like drying and perfect conditions, another thing that one of my
[36:29.020 --> 36:34.940]  bosses shared with me is to soak towels and hang them from the same place that you're hanging your
[36:34.940 --> 36:37.100]  weed from. Interesting.
[36:37.980 --> 36:43.340]  Yeah. Like soak your towels in water and have them in the area. So you're literally introducing
[36:44.220 --> 36:49.580]  humidity to into your environment because, you know, a lot of these environments are too dry.
[36:49.580 --> 36:54.140]  And that is the, you know, one of the issues is your your pot dries way, way, way too quickly.
[36:55.820 --> 37:00.780]  I used to leave a it's just interesting you say that because I used to leave a
[37:01.740 --> 37:07.020]  a plate or a dish or something that is you want to plate because it's flat and it's more surface
[37:07.020 --> 37:15.660]  area. But I would leave that by the back at my dad's house years and years ago. I used to stick
[37:15.660 --> 37:22.220]  a plate of water right next to the air vents that are down on the floor. So it would just moisten
[37:22.220 --> 37:29.260]  the air as it came into the room and not dry things quite as fast. Hopefully. Yeah. I'm not
[37:29.340 --> 37:33.500]  sure how effective it is. It works better in a closet if you're trying to affect the humidity of
[37:34.620 --> 37:39.980]  like your bedroom or something. But once I get an idea, I'll try it on anything. So.
[37:41.260 --> 37:46.300]  Yeah, for sure. I mean, this this person just put a really good comment I wanted to touch on. The
[37:46.300 --> 37:51.500]  human body is not supposed to breathe in oils on a regular even small amount. Yeah. I mean,
[37:51.500 --> 37:54.540]  that's that's a really good point.
[37:54.540 --> 38:00.620]  I've wondered about that for a long time. I've always considered that to be one of those
[38:01.180 --> 38:07.580]  things where people that are against, especially like against smoking tobacco and stuff when they
[38:07.580 --> 38:13.580]  if they're less educated on the subject and they're like, you know, it's so much worse for
[38:13.580 --> 38:18.380]  your lungs and all this. I've I've never really agreed with that. But I've also felt like,
[38:18.940 --> 38:25.260]  you know, you're combusting an oil based thing. So it's not, you know, in particularly good in a
[38:25.260 --> 38:32.220]  smoke form. And then when concentrate, it's got popular. I've seen people, you know, discussing
[38:32.220 --> 38:42.140]  like, OK, and so, you know, combusting more carbon in it or whatever is so much better.
[38:43.100 --> 38:49.980]  And it just I'm not a scientist, so I didn't want to just outright disagree that. But that
[38:49.980 --> 38:56.780]  never sounded right to me. Like, you know, now it's just an oil that you're combusting or vaporizing
[38:56.780 --> 39:04.380]  or whatever. I feel like breathing oil in. That's always been a question I've had about
[39:05.260 --> 39:11.100]  like how that's actually a safer alternative. So I'm glad I'm glad that guy said that.
[39:12.780 --> 39:16.780]  Yeah. I mean, I think he was referring to like the oils that you're spraying on the plants.
[39:17.260 --> 39:25.340]  But I mean, same but oil, same oil. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, oil over oil isn't like,
[39:25.340 --> 39:30.940]  you know, I have asthma. And so like, I feel like, you know, I can tell if I smoke just dabs,
[39:30.940 --> 39:37.660]  my lungs feel a certain way. You know, just flowers. My lungs also feel, you know, a certain
[39:37.660 --> 39:46.060]  way. And, you know, also like there are expectorants in flower, right, that help you
[39:46.060 --> 39:52.860]  cough. And I think that also keep your lungs at a certain level of health so that it doesn't
[39:52.860 --> 40:01.660]  stick to them. But yeah, I mean, to me, it's like, would you rather smoke pesticides or would you
[40:01.660 --> 40:09.900]  rather smoke powdered mildew? You know, that's kind of like. Yeah, as long as we make the
[40:09.900 --> 40:16.380]  pesticides something that's gentle on the human body, you know what I mean? Like, I would definitely
[40:16.380 --> 40:24.220]  rather it be like rosemary oil and powdery mildew. But then again, you know, neem oil,
[40:25.180 --> 40:29.980]  that's a hard toss up. Neem can put people in the hospital.
[40:32.540 --> 40:40.540]  And I don't know if PM has ever really done that. But yeah, that's why I say as long as we're using
[40:40.540 --> 40:47.580]  gentle pesticides. Yeah. And I mean, I'd also argue that like that's one of the positives of
[40:47.580 --> 40:54.780]  the legal market is that they do test heavily for pesticides and for powdered mildew. And I think
[40:54.780 --> 41:02.540]  that that is a good. Yeah. The idea of it is as long as people don't find a way to cheat it, but
[41:02.540 --> 41:08.940]  oftentimes, you know, they just bring in a sample for testing. So it doesn't represent
[41:08.940 --> 41:13.980]  the person's entire batch. But the idea behind it, yeah, I agree.
[41:16.300 --> 41:20.620]  Like, yeah, we definitely need clean product on the shelves.
[41:21.900 --> 41:26.700]  And I mean, in reality, it's like the same thing that like, God.
[41:28.620 --> 41:35.260]  So they're like regulatory agency. They should be like, the cannabis regulatory agency should be
[41:35.260 --> 41:40.460]  going in and they should be taking samples of people's crops and testing. You know,
[41:42.860 --> 41:50.540]  you know, they're the people that goes in and shouldn't be a grower to sample every time
[41:50.540 --> 41:54.460]  of their products, because one, it's practical, and two, they can definitely, like you're saying,
[41:54.460 --> 42:00.460]  they can cherry pick with, you know, high TTC percentages, not, you know, sprayed and those
[42:00.460 --> 42:05.900]  kind of things. It's always the very nicest top flower.
[42:09.100 --> 42:13.340]  Oh, the H.S.? Sorry, I'm wrong. Moving around.
[42:19.090 --> 42:25.090]  No, you're good. You're good. Even natural products, humans are giant. Yeah, chemistry.
[42:25.970 --> 42:33.170]  Yeah, I mean, you know, we're all, this is all experiment. I mean, one thing I will say
[42:34.210 --> 42:39.650]  is, you know, people, I would be very hesitant to use vape pens often.
[42:46.290 --> 42:50.610]  They are not, we don't know what the effect is on those people.
[42:50.690 --> 42:57.810]  So what I've been telling my family to do is to buy the nicest ceramic vape pens you can to fill
[42:57.810 --> 43:10.050]  your own pens. Because, you know, the ones that you get more, they're reusable and you charge
[43:10.050 --> 43:17.170]  them and stuff, you can actually put like dabs in those. But the cartridges, that's never all
[43:17.170 --> 43:23.490]  just dabs. They always cut it with like some kind of oil. Like I've worked at a place that did it
[43:23.490 --> 43:30.850]  with sweet almond oil. And I think other people do coconut or something, but like, none of that's
[43:30.850 --> 43:36.930]  good. Yeah. Like you definitely don't want to be breathing that stuff. And I don't understand why
[43:36.930 --> 43:42.770]  they're cutting their product in the first place just because it's in a cartridge. Other than,
[43:42.850 --> 43:50.690]  of course, just trying to extend it, make money. But I would think if you were going to go that
[43:50.690 --> 43:56.050]  route, you would find something a little more, you know, consumable that isn't
[43:56.690 --> 43:59.730]  going to hospitalize your clients if you want them to come back.
[44:02.770 --> 44:07.730]  Well, you know, what people can definitely do is you can purchase,
[44:08.530 --> 44:16.930]  they're like ceramic bait pen cartridges that have nicer quality pieces in them, like,
[44:16.930 --> 44:24.130]  what is it called? Atomizers. And so, it's practical for a company to sell those to make money.
[44:24.690 --> 44:32.610]  But you could buy those yourself and you can put in your oil into those. And, you know, like to me,
[44:32.610 --> 44:39.730]  that seems a bit more healthy. I also made oil and, you know, worked at a place where we would
[44:39.730 --> 44:47.890]  make RSO oil and then we would put in mint sometimes, mint flavoring, all these different
[44:48.610 --> 45:00.930]  like food grade oil. And I mean, it was crazy. You had to wear gloves to use the flavoring.
[45:01.490 --> 45:06.690]  It was so strong. Like if you spilled it on your hands, like you'd have to go to the bathroom,
[45:06.690 --> 45:11.330]  wash your hands immediately because it was like, you know what I mean? Not like, say,
[45:11.330 --> 45:18.530]  like crazy concentrated or cherry or whatever. We mixed that in with RSO oil and put it in
[45:18.530 --> 45:26.530]  bait pen carts, you know? That's what we did. And it was crazy. I mean, the one thing that's
[45:26.530 --> 45:30.690]  really interesting is like if you put a lot of flavoring in them, it doesn't smell like weed.
[45:31.490 --> 45:38.210]  And for people who live in illegal States, it's not a bad idea. You know, if you breathe it out,
[45:38.930 --> 45:44.450]  like cherry or whatever, I mean, you shouldn't be smoking it, but it's interesting. And then
[45:44.450 --> 45:51.010]  on a side note, I had this buddy who made spliff carts. So he would take, I guess,
[45:51.010 --> 45:59.970]  tobacco juice and his weed juice and mix them together. And he had these spliff carts.
[46:00.930 --> 46:08.050]  And that's what he smoked. So I don't know. It's probably not that good for you.
[46:11.090 --> 46:19.250]  But I mean, and also it's like, you know, you can make your own.
[46:19.250 --> 46:19.330]  What?
[46:19.330 --> 46:24.610]  I was going to say, you can make your own bait carts. Like if you just have some like shitty
[46:24.610 --> 46:29.570]  rosin, you know, some really runny rosin, you can put those in your carts. Like it doesn't have to
[46:29.570 --> 46:35.250]  be distilled or you know what I mean? Anything like that. It can just be like some rosin.
[46:38.370 --> 46:40.530]  Even if you have a hairdryer, you know,
[46:44.050 --> 46:49.170]  causing degradation from extreme heat. Cause that's essentially what they had us doing it.
[46:49.170 --> 46:56.370]  I worked at a lab one time that did concentrates and I worked basically from their basement
[46:57.010 --> 47:01.810]  packaging department all the way into their building. So I've done like most of the things
[47:01.810 --> 47:08.690]  at that place. And what were we just talking about? I'm sorry.
[47:10.130 --> 47:12.210]  Oh, we were talking about the end grips.
[47:14.610 --> 47:17.410]  Like you were saying you'd need a hairdryer to.
[47:18.370 --> 47:24.450]  Well, yeah, yeah. When it came to filling the cartridges, they, you know, you have like an
[47:24.450 --> 47:31.810]  oral syringe and you fill it with oil, they'll give you like a jar or whatever, but the viscosity
[47:31.810 --> 47:36.690]  changes as it sits at room temperature. And so you just kind of would like heat this jar from
[47:36.690 --> 47:46.210]  the outside with a little heat gun thing to keep this stuff runny enough. And so, yeah, you know,
[47:46.210 --> 47:50.210]  if you were going to make your own cart, like you were talking about, you had some runny rosin.
[47:51.410 --> 47:56.930]  If you just, you know, use a blow dryer, you should be able to
[47:56.930 --> 48:01.250]  keep it from thickening up long enough to get it into your cartridge.
[48:04.050 --> 48:08.610]  Do you think once it's in the cart, once like you hit the atomizer, it basically melt to like
[48:09.570 --> 48:11.170]  it's melt down in that way?
[48:14.770 --> 48:16.290]  Probably as long as it's a good,
[48:18.690 --> 48:25.170]  good product and everything. But I figure, yeah, it's that actually I haven't thought of too much
[48:25.170 --> 48:32.770]  because I'm not much of a vapor as far as dad. I started vaping nicotine smoking, but
[48:33.330 --> 48:36.370]  that's neither here nor there. The,
[48:38.770 --> 48:44.980]  yeah, it might burn the coil out faster or something. Who knows? You know, I feel like if
[48:44.980 --> 48:50.020]  you prime it, though, a lot of times, you know, you can sit there and just hit the button for a
[48:50.020 --> 48:58.420]  couple seconds, a few times to warm everything up. And then, then once you hold it down, it should,
[48:58.900 --> 49:11.330]  it shouldn't like be overpowered by how cool the oil is. Yeah. I mean, like I can see it when
[49:11.330 --> 49:17.650]  people are doing those emails and they're doing like huge, like few minutes long slabs of shatter
[49:17.650 --> 49:23.330]  or whatever. But now I think a vape pen could probably take it. It's just oil.
[49:24.050 --> 49:30.690]  Now, if you put some like full melt in there, I'm not sure about that. And that's, I prefer
[49:31.650 --> 49:40.930]  hashish because it usually has more turps than most concentrates that I find. And I've always
[49:40.930 --> 49:46.850]  felt like it would be really cool to be able to put some full melt, you know, on a dabbing
[49:46.850 --> 49:55.810]  apparatus, but it usually, it hadn't worked in the past anyway, because I hadn't learned about
[49:57.010 --> 50:02.930]  that Frenchie technique of spraying the water through your screens. And so once I started
[50:02.930 --> 50:10.770]  knowing to wash the hash and everything in this last couple of years, I've seen just regular bubble
[50:11.570 --> 50:24.610]  hash that I think is very, is probably very dabble. Of course, there's more plant matter
[50:24.610 --> 50:33.410]  in that too. So it's not necessarily cleaner than a dab. And then this is where we get all
[50:33.410 --> 50:38.690]  into that whole discussion of if it even really, it might be cleaner, but it's oil. So is it really
[50:38.690 --> 50:45.650]  that much better? Cause it's the oil chasing after it. Like because of the waxy layer?
[50:47.490 --> 50:55.170]  Well, just because wax and shatter and stuff is more refined than hashish. So you have the whole,
[50:55.170 --> 51:05.170]  yeah, the whole, let's call it skin or whatever of the trichomes. And it's just, what I understand
[51:05.170 --> 51:09.890]  is it's lipids, you know what I mean? And so that's just, it's not even necessarily like a bad
[51:09.890 --> 51:25.330]  thing, but it's not pure oil, you know? Yeah. I mean, it's like, I guess the question is like,
[51:26.370 --> 51:29.410]  is it useful or is it detrimental?
[51:30.130 --> 51:34.610]  Right. And it seems like most people are like, yeah, we don't.
[51:37.820 --> 51:42.940]  What? Is what detrimental now?
[51:44.460 --> 51:49.420]  That waxy layer. Like to me, it kind of reminds me of like, if you have an orange,
[51:49.420 --> 51:53.900]  it's like the skin of the orange, you know what I mean? It's the part that keeps all the stuff
[51:53.900 --> 51:59.180]  on the inside in there. And so like, let's say if you made orange juice and you just squished
[51:59.180 --> 52:05.740]  everything or like if you just smoked the whole orange, it has the best stuff in the inside
[52:06.460 --> 52:17.340]  and it has this skin layer on the outside. And I suppose if you're, you know, if people,
[52:20.380 --> 52:28.620]  I mean, I don't get it like, I mean, I guess you get more, it's like people don't, you know,
[52:28.620 --> 52:36.060]  if you're squishing rosin, people say they don't like smoke flower rosin because there's a lot of
[52:36.060 --> 52:44.620]  fats that they don't like to smoke. And if you smoke hash rosin,
[52:46.380 --> 52:49.980]  they say there's less fats in the hash rosin on the flower rosin. But
[52:50.300 --> 52:58.540]  I could, I could see that. I mean, like I say, the trichome itself.
[52:59.980 --> 53:05.420]  Is it like just because there's more of a concentration of hash that you're squishing,
[53:05.420 --> 53:08.940]  of trichomes that you're squishing, there's less heads than if it's on a flower?
[53:12.140 --> 53:13.180]  Does that make sense?
[53:13.180 --> 53:13.900]  I would imagine.
[53:14.380 --> 53:24.300]  Like, what I'm thinking is that it's because the flower itself might have other kinds of fats,
[53:24.860 --> 53:30.060]  you know what I mean? So you might have like more that are just having the tissues, not so much in
[53:30.060 --> 53:37.980]  the glands or whatever. And so that could add to your larger amount.
[53:39.340 --> 53:40.140]  For sure.
[53:40.140 --> 53:46.540]  Because essentially, yeah, you're leaving the fats behind when you take hash and you squeeze it.
[53:47.100 --> 53:53.660]  It's essentially just like milking those and you're just getting all the
[53:54.540 --> 53:56.460]  fats would be left behind in your rotten bag.
[54:09.180 --> 54:10.380]  So what are you breeding this year?
[54:10.860 --> 54:13.340]  Oh man, do I have some projects in the works.
[54:15.100 --> 54:22.540]  And I've had some, you know, some things that have kind of obstructed what was going on. Like,
[54:22.540 --> 54:29.500]  I was going to do a decent open pollination of the temple flow by DJ Short. And just,
[54:29.500 --> 54:37.740]  right, like most of my bit the dust. And then I've had, I've had things come like right when
[54:38.140 --> 54:43.420]  I've had, I've had things come like right when they started a flower, something like a deer came
[54:43.420 --> 54:49.900]  and just bit the male and half and left me like three little branches, all that kind of stuff.
[54:49.900 --> 54:55.260]  But through it all, I have a lot of things I'm excited for mainly working with that
[54:55.260 --> 55:03.020]  Cerro Este Mexican by Snow High. And the I'm gonna, I'm gonna be doing a good bit with the
[55:03.020 --> 55:11.660]  blood orange from Bodie and the Bing Histro bread from Suamo. And I got some gooey breeder stuff too.
[55:14.380 --> 55:17.180]  What is the difference between temple flow and flow?
[55:19.740 --> 55:23.020]  Temple flow is like a grandparent.
[55:23.100 --> 55:30.140]  I say, temple flow. From looking at the chart, if I'm not mistaken, it's the first
[55:30.700 --> 55:37.980]  cumulative land race hybrid of DJ Shorts, whole like repertoire. So like,
[55:39.500 --> 55:44.380]  it's that's just the first hybrid he made out of in and used out of his,
[55:45.100 --> 55:52.140]  his land race pool of Afghan, T-Thighs and a Mexican. And it's a parent of blueberry.
[55:53.260 --> 56:00.700]  It might just be a parent of flow. But yeah, like the things that came from it were like flow, blueberry.
[56:03.260 --> 56:06.460]  And honestly, I can't, I'd have to look at the chart again. It's been a minute.
[56:07.100 --> 56:11.740]  But it's just way down there at the bottom where like all the little
[56:12.140 --> 56:15.660]  races first meet. It's his first time. And it's just always.
[56:17.660 --> 56:20.380]  What's that? He said it's his first hybrid.
[56:26.180 --> 56:30.100]  Newly released 100 packs or 101 or something. So I was pretty,
[56:31.940 --> 56:35.220]  I was pretty stoked to get one coming at it late in the game.
[56:35.220 --> 56:40.660]  I was in Jamaica when it dropped. So I wasn't even trying to buy anything. But
[56:41.620 --> 56:50.740]  trying to buy anything with food out there. But yeah, it smells incredible.
[56:53.140 --> 56:58.020]  What's that? Oh, no, keep talking. I'm just trying to post a picture of the flow on my screen.
[56:58.980 --> 57:08.100]  I got you can see I fell in love. I fell in love with flow. When I moved to Denver. It was the
[57:08.260 --> 57:16.100]  first flow. And although it's everywhere out there, it's one of the most common strains
[57:16.100 --> 57:22.740]  to find like Gorilla Glue and Golden Goat and stuff. A lot of people will have those three,
[57:22.740 --> 57:33.220]  like those in flow. And I worked at a place where like, their cut of flow, I'm not going to get into
[57:33.940 --> 57:37.140]  any of the politics of this place or who they are or anything, but like,
[57:38.100 --> 57:45.780]  the end product? No. But it wasn't the plant's fault. It was how it was grown. While it's
[57:45.780 --> 57:51.460]  growing, that coat was just so ridiculously, it was delicious, like blueberry rye bread,
[57:51.460 --> 58:01.300]  slathered in Play-Doh. And it would just stink up the whole warehouse. And so I already really
[58:01.300 --> 58:07.220]  loved that. And then when I got these temple flows grown, and I could stem rubble, it was just
[58:07.220 --> 58:15.620]  almost like that, that flow on steroids or something. It just smells so good. And that
[58:15.620 --> 58:20.340]  also is related to the flow. So like temple flow buds would look similar to flow buds.
[58:22.180 --> 58:27.460]  I would say. Can you see the picture on the screen? Yes.
[58:27.620 --> 58:32.580]  And honestly, I mean, that's about what mine look like right now as far as like,
[58:32.580 --> 58:37.860]  how far along they are, but the flower is not as purple. That's more purple than mine.
[58:39.620 --> 58:47.030]  How's the effect? Because that's why I've never.
[58:47.990 --> 59:00.950]  Yeah, I know flow has a nice, clear, happy, like, up effect. People in,
[59:02.390 --> 59:08.150]  in like Denver treated like a pool, almost, which I wouldn't quite go that far. But like,
[59:08.790 --> 59:15.110]  it's, you know what I mean? It's a famous for a reason. It's got a nice,
[59:15.830 --> 59:21.510]  smooth and like happy, clear, functional high. And it isn't just some like,
[59:22.470 --> 59:26.870]  you wasted a day sleeping on the couch, kind of stuff.
[59:28.870 --> 59:34.230]  No, I mean, I guess that's kind of a trick question. Because I mean, I grew it last year.
[59:34.230 --> 59:39.830]  Like I was kind of just like curious what your opinion was, but I completely concur. I liked it
[59:39.830 --> 59:46.710]  in the blueberry. It was the first thing of my smoke to go. It was the first thing that I smoked
[59:46.710 --> 59:52.630]  all of. So to me, that's always a really good thing. And yeah, like I could smoke it every
[59:52.630 --> 59:57.670]  single day. It was like, like you said, it was for me, it was kind of like antidepressant.
[59:58.630 --> 01:00:02.950]  And like stimulating in the right way. Because sometimes the sativas are almost like,
[01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:08.150]  on ground, like I need something to ground me more. And I'm like too much in my head.
[01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:09.590]  Yeah.
[01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:17.110]  Yeah, I would completely agree. I mean, the flow is, yeah, I mean, it was really awesome. That's
[01:00:17.110 --> 01:00:22.150]  why I've just been like, really intrigued by people talking about Temple Flow. You know,
[01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:26.550]  perhaps I'd heard about it, but you know, never really stuck. And then actually somebody was
[01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:32.710]  doing an auction and sold a pack of flow or Temple Flow for like 300 bucks.
[01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:33.590]  300 bucks.
[01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:35.990]  Yeah, it was.
[01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:41.670]  There's something I'm missing here. Like this is obviously some fire if people are just,
[01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:50.470]  you know, getting that much for it, like off the bat. So yeah, that's pretty interesting.
[01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:57.030]  And also what I find is really interesting is like my flow plant grows very differently than
[01:00:57.030 --> 01:01:03.990]  all of my other plants. You know, like, definitely not selected for like any type
[01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:08.470]  of growth pattern. It's like the least vigorous of my plants. It's the least amount of bud
[01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:16.070]  on the flow. It kind of has like, almost look like Thai traits to it.
[01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:26.230]  You know, like these Thai growth traits where it's like, kind of viney in this really interesting way,
[01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:32.710]  but it's never like, like it never took off like a sativa. You know what I mean? Where it just like,
[01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:37.830]  is mad vigorous, and you just get tons and tons and tons of leaves, like it's kind of on the lower
[01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:47.990]  vigor side. But like, it has these kind of like, I don't know, it's like creeping sativa branches.
[01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:54.950]  So like the growth structure is like sativa. But the vigor is much more of like a
[01:01:57.190 --> 01:02:00.150]  lower to like mid vigor type of plant.
[01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.710]  Yeah.
[01:02:03.350 --> 01:02:04.150]  Which is interesting.
[01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:05.030]  Interesting.
[01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:13.430]  Yeah. But still, like you're saying, like the sativa look to the buds, the sativa effect to
[01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:23.830]  the buds. And also like, there's various information on why it's named flow, which is, you know,
[01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:29.430]  of course, typical. Because like, I had read some things back in the day that said like,
[01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:37.350]  they named it flow because it was a flow of buds. Harvest it, there was a long window that it could
[01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:43.430]  be harvested. So like, you could start at like, seven, or especially in like a greenhouse, start
[01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:50.630]  at like week seven. And it continuously grows new buds, they get bigger and then you get harvested.
[01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:56.150]  Um, but obviously, from listening to podcasts with DJ Shore, he's
[01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:04.230]  that's why it's called flow. So I don't know, did you have you ever heard that other story before?
[01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:18.950]  I, it's possible, the reflowering thing, but I, I've either, I must have been told real early on,
[01:03:19.350 --> 01:03:23.750]  by someone about the Floraline thing. Because I have this book, but I actually
[01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:30.150]  got it is more of a souvenir. More recently, whereas like, I've been
[01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:39.590]  like looking into flow since the early 2000s. And so somewhere along the line, yeah,
[01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:44.470]  I heard Floraline, and it's just his abbreviation.
[01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:50.550]  When he, you know, in his notebook or something, this is what he called it. But
[01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:58.150]  yeah, it's an interesting one. And I just always felt that the temple flow would probably be
[01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:04.950]  very interesting as well. It predates it, and is like a parent to it.
[01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:12.630]  Um, and I'm a big fan of the Mexican stuff. So the fact that it's a Highland Oaxaca wiener,
[01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:19.190]  that automatically draws me to and gives me a lot of ideas for crosses.
[01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:27.350]  Unfortunately, this year, we only have so much pollen and so many pistols, but
[01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:31.670]  I'm doing what I can to work that out.
[01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:35.430]  Well, man, if you can save me a little bit of pollen, I'll hit up some,
[01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:41.030]  some, my flow cut, or I'll even send it to you. I mean, it's all good.
[01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:43.050]  Yeah.
[01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:49.750]  I can do that. It's funny, you know, you're saying about,
[01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:59.350]  they said it like, because it, it will flow out. That's how I do the males that I grow,
[01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:04.390]  that I grow generally in pollen collection. I cut a bunch of moth and I leave
[01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:12.230]  like bud sites on the stock and I let it regrow flowers about four times usually. So I still have,
[01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:18.710]  I still have like a second flush, I think, in a bag somewhere that I need to shake out and collect.
[01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:19.610]  I should be.
[01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:28.870]  Awesome. Hey, I'm going to, I was going to show some of, some pictures from
[01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:32.150]  some of the stuff I'm working with. That's cool.
[01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:37.670]  Yeah. Let's see.
[01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:44.790]  I guess let me turn this one off for a second. Get you guys out of the matrix.
[01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:56.630]  Here we have some Hawaiian lions that my homie and one of my breeding partners, Grasshopper,
[01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:02.550]  gifted me to work with. So I've been working with these
[01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:08.230]  Hawaiians and yeah, I'm pretty stoked at how,
[01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:16.150]  yeah, I'm pretty stoked at how it's, how they're looking pretty good right now.
[01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:23.830]  Let's do the 25 first. Okay. So this is the most Indica version.
[01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:27.750]  I guess I'll put them all in here and this is the 23.
[01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:35.830]  So yeah, these lions have been, so basically I started with like 40 seeds.
[01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:42.950]  Found some males, I found some females, hunted through the males. I have one male hunted through
[01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:59.750]  the females. I have five or six females. Okay. Yeah. Five or six, I guess we'll go sativa to
[01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:08.710]  Indica. So yeah, I picked this one male. He's like super sticky when you like stem rub him, he smells
[01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:14.230]  like the bud smell. And like when you go like this with your fingers, like they stick together.
[01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:20.870]  So we'll see what happens with him. I've flowered him out. Where'd we go? Where are we going to?
[01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:31.590]  Add to stream. Okay. And then boom. Okay. Here we go. So here is the most sativa Hanalei.
[01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:46.150]  It was kind of taken from far away, but yeah. So yeah, I'm pretty stoked on these.
[01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:58.150]  I'm sorry, what? Are you keeping up with the stem color? I've seen like there's green and red stem
[01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:09.350]  expressions on the Hanalei. These ones have a purplish on actually the most sativa one,
[01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:16.390]  which is this one. And the other ones seem way more on the green side. So yeah, this one,
[01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:22.630]  this was taken like yesterday or something. So yeah, it's like, has a ways to go. But
[01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:28.310]  I mean, killer structure, I mean, they, you know, stretch a lot. They get pretty big. Like
[01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:34.310]  there are ones that are maybe half to a quarter that's cloned off of that plant. I mean, which
[01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:43.030]  is great. You know, I mean, you can just like clone off clone off. And then here is the next
[01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:52.470]  one. This is the 23. I like that. Yeah. I'm using the pot on pot technique. If you can see in the
[01:08:52.470 --> 01:09:02.710]  bottom. Oh, yeah. Okay. Small one on the big one. Yeah. Yeah. Because basically like this pot wasn't
[01:09:02.710 --> 01:09:07.270]  big enough. The plants were wilting too much. So, you know, I was like, fuck it. I just put
[01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:17.350]  another pot inside of it. And I find that for like heat waves. This is really the way. Super,
[01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:23.670]  super crucial. Yeah. Because, you know, like most of the roots are going to kind of stop around
[01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:28.390]  the first pot. And then you put that second one in there. It really gives it insulation
[01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:35.990]  for heat, for moisture and for heat. So like this plant, I thought dealt with the heat wave the best
[01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:42.150]  out of all of them. And you can use it to kind of. Yeah. Like if you kind of want them to like
[01:09:42.150 --> 01:09:46.790]  stunt a little bit and not be too huge, you can like start them in a smaller pot and then you put
[01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:55.590]  them in the bigger one. So they have that, you know, bigger moisture bank. So that was the middle
[01:09:55.590 --> 01:10:05.830]  one. And then here is the most indica one. Yeah. The twenty five. And yeah, I mean, the twenty five
[01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:10.790]  is interesting because like the structure was kind of like like certain ones, the structure
[01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:15.110]  was all sativa. And then as soon as you got to this one, the twenty five, it's like the structure
[01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:22.150]  is like quite different. It's more of like, you know, less bud sites, but kind of bigger buds
[01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:30.390]  and, you know, flowering earlier. But like to me, what's the most interesting thing was that when I
[01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:37.110]  test grew them and of course it was seeded, they all smelled very, very, very similar. I could not
[01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:41.190]  really take like pick a difference between like the five or six keepers,
[01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:47.510]  which I'm really excited about because, you know, if that continues, then basically I can have
[01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:53.270]  various lines of the same product. You know what I mean? You can have like a sativa one or
[01:10:53.270 --> 01:11:00.390]  three sativa one or whatever, you know, however many weeks you want. But the product is still,
[01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:09.430]  you know, comparable or similar. So, yeah, this is this is the twenty five. It's like the most
[01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:15.190]  Indica one. I have a few other phenos, too, but these were the ones I'm the most
[01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:22.320]  most into got the best spots in the garden. Yeah, they look great.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:29.520]  Yeah, no, I'm juiced about them. Grousehopper hooked it up and,
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.680]  you know, a pheno hunted in the spring.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:44.080]  Yeah, early beasting. And like you said, you know, like the more tropical stuff handles the heat
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:59.600]  a lot better. Yeah, the main thing I noticed on a lot of the modern stuff is
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:05.680]  like septoria way more susceptible to the hot and humidity when they get the spots on the leaves.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:17.840]  Landraces haven't really done that. So, yeah. How about how about things that are like hybrid
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:22.640]  hybrids that are like, you know, partially landrace and partially more modern? Do you
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:34.880]  have any things like that? Oh, man, I would have to. Now that I'm sitting here on the spot,
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:46.240]  I can't think of anything. I don't think so. Well, I have the cross with the Jamaican that I made.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.520]  And I have a.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:01.440]  Like the Durban land spread called poison bread that is.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:10.420]  It's one of the younger I want to say, like most of the stuff that I have like that,
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:17.060]  that I was just thinking of, they're much younger and smaller. They got a late start and
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:24.980]  so I can't really even they got planted once the heat with ever and everything.
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:28.100]  So they got a whole different kind of life.
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:36.020]  Because, I mean, for me, like that's kind of my goal is to like mix more modern stuff with
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:40.740]  landrace or, you know, old school stuff so that there is that bigger. Because I mean,
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:45.860]  like, you know, like I like smoking old school stuff, but I also really like smoking new school
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:53.460]  stuff, too. And I feel like a lot of the landrace stuff, to be honest, I don't always smoke all of
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:14:00.740]  it. You know, like I'll be still reaching for some more modern stuff. But like for me, I feel
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:08.260]  like a lot of the place for it is worked into other lines to give them that more, you know,
[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:18.740]  that more, more, I don't know, stability or vigor. Resistance, I guess what is resistance.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:27.620]  Yeah, so I mean, that's why I was really curious, you know, if any of the hybrids that you had made,
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:32.660]  you know, if you found that some of those actually, you know, did stand up to the extreme conditions.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:43.620]  Yeah, I, the main of things that I've made, the main one would be that Jamaican and
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:52.900]  monkey paw cross. And really, I mean, I just it's, I can't use that as much of an example,
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:15:01.460]  because it's very small, and it hasn't, it didn't go through the season, really. So it's,
[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:08.180]  it's hard to say. I had so many things just get eaten by grasshoppers, like,
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:10.980]  I don't know.
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:15.940]  So what do you guys do you do for ground? Is there anything to do?
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:26.500]  I mean, the best thing I know is that you kind of have to, you know, keep your plants covered in it
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:32.820]  until they get to a certain height. And they do kind of continue to grow and stuff. But
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:41.060]  so, you know, feels kind of weird having to cover them with it. But the grasshoppers won't eat it.
[01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:43.780]  So at least for the most part.
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:46.740]  So basically, a physical barrier.
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:47.620]  Physical barrier.
[01:15:49.220 --> 01:16:01.940]  Yeah. Yeah. And I don't know. Sometimes, you never know if you're done with them or not,
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:06.980]  because like I say, do it to a certain height. But really, once they get really,
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:14.340]  you could have a really big plant, and those things will just go top it. So they're always
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:18.100]  acceptable. You can't just throw DE on them.
[01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:28.930]  It almost sounds like, or to me, it really does sound like having your cannabis is more part of
[01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:37.650]  like a food system, or like a food forest might be more practical than like monocropping, just with
[01:16:37.650 --> 01:16:44.610]  like, the number of animal, you know what I mean? Just pressures that are around, it seems like you
[01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:53.250]  would need more of like an ecosystem to like, be normally, that would be the case. When, as soon as
[01:16:53.250 --> 01:17:06.050]  I moved here, me and the guy that I'm staying with, like he, he was saying something about moving
[01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:15.490]  also. So I kept my, my plants in pots. And then I didn't end up moving. So it's like,
[01:17:15.490 --> 01:17:24.050]  too late to put them in the ground. Not really, not really happy about that.
[01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:34.850]  That is added to the, you know what I mean? The number of pressures because, in my opinion, the
[01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:44.530]  black pot, it gets too hot, and it cooks the roots. And, you know, the longer that, you know,
[01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:53.570]  it is moist, the longer that heat tends to build up with like, I don't know, potentially anaerobic
[01:17:53.570 --> 01:18:01.330]  pressures or whatever. Got to try to keep a really quick dry on it. And the, I've seen some things
[01:18:01.330 --> 01:18:10.610]  just melt in their pots. It just seemed like the, the medium would heat up, but it would not dry,
[01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:18.050]  the plants would not drink, and it just, it would stay wet with having no water added for so long.
[01:18:18.930 --> 01:18:23.810]  And yeah, just for some reason, I feel like that had nothing,
[01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:32.450]  or it only had to do with that black pot heating up. When you move things into a cooler spot.
[01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:40.850]  Yeah, I mean, I mean, suppose, I guess, theoretically, the roots could be too hot to drink,
[01:18:41.410 --> 01:18:45.410]  or could be damaged. And so then they're just like sitting in essentially like hot,
[01:18:47.970 --> 01:18:49.410]  like infected water.
[01:18:50.370 --> 01:18:53.250]  There's too many of them to go around and wrap them in cardboard.
[01:18:54.210 --> 01:18:59.890]  If you wrap them in cardboard, it kind of insulates the sun, like, directly.
[01:19:01.410 --> 01:19:07.170]  Yeah, man, pot inside of a pot is the new way, man. Like that's, I think that that would really
[01:19:07.170 --> 01:19:11.730]  help because then you'll have more moisture, and, you know, will protect the roots from
[01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:19.660]  from that heat too. Yeah.
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:27.260]  Yeah, I mean, live and learn. When you don't know, you shouldn't plant seeds,
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:31.180]  if you don't know what you're going to be doing, and let me be a lesson to you.
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:37.660]  I mean, it's hard, like, it's hard to find.
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:41.500]  Like if you're a stable situation, and you think things might be changing,
[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:43.340]  it's better to just save your seeds.
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:47.020]  Yeah.
[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:49.500]  But yeah.
[01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:56.780]  Um, what's up with your, I'd love to talk about your homie in Jamaica. What's up with him?
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:03.980]  Right on. Um, Natty Farmyard. He's,
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:14.380]  he's just building a, they're building the setup that I had tried to get in and help on
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:21.420]  when I moved out there and everything. What with COVID letting up, there's a lot more that they're,
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:30.300]  they're able to actually get accomplished. And so yeah, I just I asked him to make an Instagram so
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:42.380]  that it would, he could advertise himself properly and I'll be happy to get in touch with him.
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:50.300]  You want to have a conversation with him. He's really the better guy to talk to about it. I'm not
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:59.180]  the intricacies. I just know he's, he's doing, you know, a forward thinking grow out there.
[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:06.380]  It's very, I know he's, he's utilizing Google culture and basically just trying to do
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:11.020]  different things out there and teach along the way.
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:23.260]  Leave behind like the, the elder strains and whatnot.
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:28.780]  And is the product that they're smoking? I think we might've spoken about this before.
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:35.020]  But is this product sold to like tourists or is this like for the community? Like what kind of
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:44.380]  light is he working with? Some sort of license? Yeah, I believe it's, and again, he'll be better
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:51.820]  to say than I, but yeah, I believe so. It's like, it's a Sacramento farm and when you have a
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:22:02.460]  Sacramento farm, you know, it's thereby legalized. And so you have to set up a vibe as I've been told
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:10.780]  where you know what I mean? You have to make it legit. And it depends who you have deals with,
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:15.420]  though. Are you talking to a dispensary and are you going to try to sell to a dispensary?
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:26.860]  The, the Bobos that I was familiar with, they have one. And so I imagine when you get a
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:33.580]  Sacramento thing through them, it's called a sign. And you literally get a sign you have to post up
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:42.380]  saying that you're like authorized by the Ethiopian church, kind of to, as we were told,
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:53.660]  act with impunity. And so those dudes were telling us that, you know, a certain percentage
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:59.100]  of your harvest is going to them anyway. They're getting you that. And so already you have
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:03.180]  people there that are potentially clientele. They might just want everything else you have too.
[01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:14.460]  You know? But there's a couple other island countries that it could be exported to
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:18.940]  legally with the right contracts. So it just depends who you're talking to.
[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:23.500]  Interesting. And do they have any type of...
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:26.380]  What's up?
[01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:33.340]  I was going to say, do they have, is there any type of like regulations as far as like,
[01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:40.540]  I don't know, product testing or like how it should be grown or anything in that area?
[01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:51.420]  I wasn't there personally to get along that far. I believe so. I mean, the CLA is the Cannabis
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:24:05.790]  Licensing Authority. It's like metric out here, kind of. And they're, you know, regulating
[01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:15.950]  supposedly, but I just see the industry trying to be as much like America as possible. They
[01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:24.510]  have American companies coming in and well, they're not trying to be America except they
[01:24:25.630 --> 01:24:31.870]  like having American strains and stuff. I've seen a lot of people, I know there are people there
[01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:38.670]  that are keeping it real with the old Jamaican stuff. Don't get me wrong. But there is a lot of
[01:24:39.230 --> 01:24:48.830]  desire for the newer American stuff out there. And however you want to call it.
[01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:56.670]  Otherwise, though, yeah, they are probably modeling their business after how
[01:24:57.710 --> 01:25:04.750]  California, I hope not California, maybe like Denver, someone's done Colorado. But
[01:25:05.150 --> 01:25:08.590]  yeah, that's a hard question for me to answer really. Like I say,
[01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:14.110]  it's all about enforcement at that point. Are they doing and I don't know what they do. So
[01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:25.070]  I know it's regulated though. I'm assuming any dispensary probably has testing. You know,
[01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:32.410]  I've been to a few, but I never did think to ask them that. But there's American dispensary
[01:25:33.370 --> 01:25:37.770]  there as well. I know I've seen a couple.
[01:25:39.210 --> 01:25:44.410]  Like to me, that would be like, the most interesting thing would be to have stuff
[01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:48.890]  be tested because I know that there's often, you know, powder mill doing different kinds of
[01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:55.370]  funguses, you know, those kind of pressures. So like, it would be great for those for people in
[01:25:55.370 --> 01:26:03.290]  those areas to have access to proper drying facilities, you know, and just proper facilities
[01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:12.250]  to make, you know, to grow stuff to that next level. Yeah, I mean, I'm really excited about
[01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:17.930]  that. Because that's for me, the most disappointing thing about smoking, you know, Caribbean,
[01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:23.690]  Mexican type of stuff is that it's not cured as well. And so it's like, you can't really tell,
[01:26:23.690 --> 01:26:28.490]  like, it could be some fire. It could be some mids. You don't, you know what I mean? You don't
[01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:35.770]  really know until you smoke it, but it all usually doesn't taste as good. Outdoor from out here.
[01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:40.810]  Is that your experience? Did you find that there is stuff cured properly in the Caribbean?
[01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:46.090]  I mean, you know, just as a tourist, I was never, rarely able to come across it.
[01:26:46.810 --> 01:26:54.970]  Well, again, I've come across some stuff that was more known, like, you know, clone only things and
[01:26:54.970 --> 01:27:08.650]  whatnot. I feel like, yeah, you know, what I've smoked has been clean. I have seen things that
[01:27:09.610 --> 01:27:17.930]  are under attack of some kind of power and they'll do it. I don't know. I don't know that
[01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:22.970]  they're using it. And it hasn't, it's not just about to be a cold either. I've only ever been
[01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:31.690]  there, you know, kind of as a tourist facility. But I know that that's one of those things that
[01:27:31.690 --> 01:27:37.850]  they do care about. You know what I mean? Like again, with an already working industry
[01:27:38.410 --> 01:27:46.890]  elsewhere in the world as their guide to standards and whatnot, they're equally as
[01:27:46.890 --> 01:27:51.770]  concerned and they know what to look for. A lot of them. It kind of, I guess it depends.
[01:27:52.730 --> 01:27:57.770]  Let's just say that, yeah, the stuff going that I've seen people growing that was legal.
[01:27:58.410 --> 01:27:59.130]  Yeah, it was clean.
[01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:02.410]  Nice.
[01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:10.570]  I've only been to places though. And it's an island full of microclimate. So it's very different
[01:28:10.570 --> 01:28:11.370]  everywhere you go.
[01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:19.050]  Yeah. And, you know, like while I was talking, I was thinking, you know, probably there are people
[01:28:19.130 --> 01:28:28.330]  who, you know, do have fire. It's just, you have to know certain people to, you know, to get to
[01:28:28.330 --> 01:28:34.010]  those places. And that can take a lifetime. You know what I mean? To know the right people
[01:28:35.130 --> 01:28:36.010]  have those things.
[01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:45.770]  Yeah. No, I will say, I've been pretty impressed by what I could pull out of the
[01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:55.210]  just the whatever seeds, you know, like it wasn't lamb's bread or anything with a name,
[01:28:55.210 --> 01:29:02.250]  but it's still, it was probably an old hybrid or something at one point, but it's still
[01:29:03.930 --> 01:29:07.290]  has some age to it or something. I found good plants in
[01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:11.210]  just about anything I've grown Jamaican.
[01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:12.970]  How many weeks were they?
[01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:16.490]  Like, how long did they take?
[01:29:17.850 --> 01:29:19.130]  Region generally.
[01:29:20.490 --> 01:29:21.370]  That's not bad at all.
[01:29:23.530 --> 01:29:29.610]  I was kind of surprised. Some of the stuff looks like the flowers are definitely like
[01:29:30.650 --> 01:29:35.530]  strongly sativa influence, but, you know, they got, they have something in there,
[01:29:35.530 --> 01:29:42.490]  like battening them up too. So yeah, I don't know. I mean, I haven't really like dug deep
[01:29:42.490 --> 01:29:48.730]  into too many of my Jamaican heirlooms, the blue mountain though, it was chunk. I was kind of,
[01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:56.570]  I'm sure it's a, it's an old strength. I'm sure it's been worked over all those years
[01:29:56.570 --> 01:30:04.330]  to explain that. But yeah, the blue mountain was, I don't know, I'm not sure how many years
[01:30:04.330 --> 01:30:14.640]  uh, but my male, I like my male better than my female. I'll put it like that. Everything turned
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:23.920]  male except for one. And the male I kept was like disgusting, which is why it was the one I kept.
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:32.000]  Everyone who did the stemmer was like, ugh. So the female was the total opposite. It was,
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:39.440]  it smelled almost like floss and she cured out into like a pineapple thing. It was an okay
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:46.000]  plant, but like the male was awesome. And that's the one that I used on the monkey paw.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:53.040]  And you, have you grown out those progeny yet or you're in the process of growing them right now?
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:59.360]  Yeah, there's a few growing right now. Again, they're small, they're flowering though, and
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:10.400]  they smell funky. So that's cool. Yeah, I don't have a lot of them. I put them in thinking
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:17.520]  that I was going to do them indoors somewhere else. And so when that didn't happen and they
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:22.240]  were just in a small container, I couldn't, I couldn't leave them in there. Couldn't throw
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:28.480]  them away. So I gave it a try and I put them in the ground and like, they're doing all right.
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:39.280]  But yeah, things, things got in unfair shape this year. They're doing okay.
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:51.760]  Having, it's funny, it's like having a secure spot to grow is way more than half the battle.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:53.040]  Yeah.
[01:31:55.920 --> 01:32:01.200]  You know, like I've, yeah, I mean, I've gone through many different this's and that's,
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:08.640]  I mean, it's just like, it takes a lot to have a good spot. There are just so many.
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:19.360]  And I mean, the most important thing is you got to think about a year ahead of you at all times.
[01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:26.400]  Yeah. I mean, to me, the most important thing is not having too greedy of a landlord.
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:32.160]  Like that seems like that's always been the hardest part is like,
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:36.720]  when you have a good spot and he's like, no, I want this much.
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:47.040]  And then all the other spots, you know, and then it's crazy. Yeah.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:51.520]  Yeah, for sure. I mean, somebody who's down there, they want so much money now. It's like,
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:58.880]  yeah, I mean, that could be a whole other episode of precarious places to grow.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:08.640]  Surprised usually by how many people in legal areas still don't allow you to grow at your house.
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:09.680]  At your house.
[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:18.000]  Like. I guess in places like Colorado and stuff, they do it by county. So even though it's legal,
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:25.920]  you can go places that it's not. And you definitely can't grow in like even in your own house.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:34.960]  And so, yeah, I'm always surprised by that, where like sometimes even in Denver,
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:40.560]  you know, you don't tell them. It's like you don't tell someone you're going to grow. You just
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:45.520]  basically look through the paperwork and see if there's a thing that says you can't.
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:49.520]  And as long as that's not there, you should be good.
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.440]  As long as you know that the county doesn't disallow it.
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.200]  Even in a legal state, you know.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:02.400]  Yeah, for sure. I mean, we like that in Cali for sure. It's like certain counties, certain cities,
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:09.280]  you know, like Oakland, for example. It's all good. You know, they don't really care. Like,
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:15.040]  you know, and just culturally, like there was a house like down the street from me.
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:20.640]  And nobody lived there. And so, you know, I mean, I don't know. I mean,
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:26.720]  from me, and nobody lived there. And me and my wife were like, thought it was kind of weird.
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:33.680]  And wouldn't you know, it was like this fat, huge grow in the whole house.
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:40.160]  And now they're tearing the whole thing down and like gutting the house. And like listening to my
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:44.880]  neighbors, you know, talk about it. They're just like, you know, they weren't like, this is some
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:49.520]  bullshit. This people, you know, have been, this has been a grow house for years where nobody's
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:54.720]  ever come in and out. They're just kind of like, yeah. So that was really interesting, because
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:59.360]  none of them are stoners whatsoever. And they just kind of were like, yeah, we knew it was a grow
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:04.320]  house. We just kind of like shrugged our shoulders. And it's, you know, it's like, I guess it's a
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:08.640]  double edged sword. Because for me, it's like, well, shit, like, if you're going to be growing
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.920]  in a house, you should at least live there at least have somebody there. You know what I mean?
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:19.360]  It's like in a neighborhood, everybody else in the block, you know, we all know our neighbors,
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:24.160]  everybody's cool, says hello to each other. And there's this one house, there's nobody ever there.
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:33.200]  It's just tacked the fuck out with with weed. I don't know. What are your thoughts on people
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:34.800]  growing in houses that they don't live in?
[01:35:38.410 --> 01:35:48.490]  I mean, it already sounds risky. You know what I mean? Like I say, if you're talking about
[01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:50.970]  renting a house from somebody to blow it up.
[01:35:55.450 --> 01:36:01.450]  You know what I mean? And it seems to me like they have, they even have like neighborhood
[01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:07.050]  laws. You know what I mean? Like, one way or the other, there's a lot of things you're supposed to
[01:36:07.050 --> 01:36:16.570]  do inside of your house, to at least like childproof it. So. So yeah, I don't know. I mean,
[01:36:16.890 --> 01:36:25.370]  I think there's better ideas in a highly populated area anyway. Like I said, I'm not in my own house
[01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:34.170]  that I own. But like, I generally know in advance, like, how long I'm going to be somewhere or
[01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:37.290]  or what, you know what I mean? So.
[01:36:38.170 --> 01:36:44.730]  And I concur. I mean, that's kind of like my thing now is like, well, a house is designed
[01:36:45.610 --> 01:36:51.370]  for people to live there, not to grow plants. You know, the amount of power that's going in there
[01:36:51.370 --> 01:36:56.570]  is just not what the area is designed for. And furthermore, if something goes wrong,
[01:36:57.530 --> 01:37:04.010]  who's there to sound the alarm? There's nobody there, regardless of the morality, what plants.
[01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:08.570]  A place that's on all timers, kind of.
[01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:13.290]  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. You know, it's like, if you know, if you're renting a warehouse that
[01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:19.850]  has that kind of power that's designed for those kind of activities, fine, whether you grow weed
[01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:25.610]  or whether you do whatever, that's what a warehouse is designed for. So I don't know,
[01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:29.690]  as I'm getting older and as I'm a homeowner, that was kind of, you know, my, you know,
[01:37:29.690 --> 01:37:36.330]  my evolving perspective on those kind of things. You know, I'm curious, right? I mean, it's like
[01:37:36.330 --> 01:37:39.930]  these coming these gray areas of like. Yeah.
[01:37:40.570 --> 01:37:49.450]  Wow. You know, I mean, if it's going to be like a danger to people, then I don't know.
[01:37:49.450 --> 01:37:53.850]  You know, I mean, I don't I still don't really have that much of an opinion on
[01:37:54.890 --> 01:38:00.090]  what other people are doing necessarily. It's like if they know what they're doing.
[01:38:02.890 --> 01:38:06.410]  And of course, people that don't know what they're doing should never be
[01:38:06.410 --> 01:38:13.210]  trying to control something that size, you know. And I don't know what gauges anyone's
[01:38:13.210 --> 01:38:19.930]  qualification or anything, but like, yeah, that's kind of unsafe, you know, to the people in the
[01:38:20.650 --> 01:38:29.260]  surrounding area and everything like you shouldn't. I don't know. I mean, if everything's
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:35.580]  if it's a newer neighborhood and everything, especially, you know, modern, it's got all the
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:40.940]  wiring is new. You know what I mean? It's not some like house from the 70s or whatever you're
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:48.860]  trying to renovate. It's definitely old house because those are the only trap houses that
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:57.100]  people rent out. Those kind of things. Well. Oh, man. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah.
[01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:02.860]  Usually, like people that are doing houses that a new power source put in, I would think.
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:11.740]  Yeah, it's usually like, you know, they either like build the circuit box of all the empty
[01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:19.660]  stuff or they get a new one put in or something to power the grow. So that that could be if
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:25.980]  someone went to that length. That's one thing. But using an older house just based on
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:30.140]  the power in the walls and stuff would have me kind of nervous.
[01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:37.350]  Yeah, that's a good point. This person. Yeah. Home garden versus commercial garden grow is
[01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:42.550]  already established zoning and agreements for other agricultural use. Yeah.
[01:39:43.670 --> 01:39:50.390]  Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Just.
[01:39:52.150 --> 01:39:58.140]  Yeah, it's still not the same as a met lab.
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.100]  I wouldn't say, but.
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:09.900]  Yeah, I mean. I haven't really been faced with that issue, to be honest.
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:17.500]  And, you know, like as I'm getting older, it's like those issues become realer to you, right?
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:25.260]  Yeah. I mean, apparently the whole for a long time, you know, we're new on the block.
[01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:33.260]  But yeah, I mean, it's like, you know, what is considered home grow versus what is considered
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:37.260]  commercial, you know what I mean, is an eight lighter in your garage.
[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:39.260]  Still like a.
[01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:40.620]  Plant for life.
[01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:47.100]  Yeah, exactly. Like yeah, you're still under your limits.
[01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:49.980]  Right. Yeah.
[01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.580]  I don't know. I mean, like.
[01:40:55.260 --> 01:41:01.500]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I mean, I don't know.
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:05.580]  I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:08.380]  I don't know. I mean, like.
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:14.060]  The only thing I would be worried about is just like what if something glitches in the place
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:22.460]  caught on fire? Like I don't have. Too much of an opinion, like some people are either.
[01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:30.460]  You know, in. They're from somewhere else and they're just like making quick money.
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:37.260]  Other people are here trying to make ends meet and really, I don't know. I mean, like.
[01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:41.660]  I don't. I don't.
[01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:48.140]  Any of the black market or white market anymore. I just I know I'm disenchanted with the white
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:49.820]  market. But.
[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:53.420]  Yeah.
[01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:54.780]  The only thing.
[01:41:57.180 --> 01:42:00.620]  Being there to make sure that it's safe for the people around you.
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:09.660]  Yeah, I mean, like, I think it's like we're like somebody told me, like, break one law at a time.
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:19.660]  So like if you're growing cannabis, which is fairly illegal, then at least, you know, at least
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:27.100]  don't break, you know, don't steal water and be a good neighbor and, you know, just don't be a dick,
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:29.660]  you know, be just be a good citizen.
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:33.100]  You know what I mean? And.
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:38.140]  You know, I mean, just be a good person, whatever that means to you.
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.740]  Regardless of whether you grow weed or not.
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:44.460]  I guess it was really the.
[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:46.060]  It was really.
[01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:47.340]  I don't know.
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:56.300]  I mean, ambivalent about actual, you know what I mean? Like people's cannabis, you know what I mean?
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:59.340]  Everyone's got to do what they got to do. I just.
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:02.300]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:08.300]  I hope they're all everyone's being safe. That's all.
[01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:13.660]  100 percent. 100 percent. Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:23.740]  Yeah, I know. I guess, you know, get into some sticky topics, but yeah, I mean.
[01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:27.980]  Well, it's like one of the things that actually comes up in Jamaica a lot.
[01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:32.380]  People steal power notoriously.
[01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:37.820]  So yeah, I don't know.
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:39.900]  I mean, it's an easy way to get busted anyway.
[01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:42.940]  Because if I know about it, everyone else.
[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:47.500]  So definitely don't steal power.
[01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:55.420]  Tragedies found a straight all the time anyway, so be careful about that.
[01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:00.730]  Yeah, 100 percent.
[01:44:01.770 --> 01:44:06.490]  And also, that was another great example of.
[01:44:06.970 --> 01:44:11.290]  You know, make sure you got your residence on lockdown.
[01:44:14.010 --> 01:44:14.730]  Because like.
[01:44:17.210 --> 01:44:21.210]  Yeah, now we're in like doing good things, you know.
[01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:26.170]  Just got to have the residency online.
[01:44:28.890 --> 01:44:32.410]  Yeah, I mean, this is almost that, you know, 10th time of year.
[01:44:33.370 --> 01:44:38.170]  Yeah, I mean, really just comes down to just, you know, being, you know, having a good community
[01:44:38.170 --> 01:44:45.450]  around you, you know, not inviting the wrong people into your life and, you know, just
[01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:48.970]  being positive and sticking to your own business kind of.
[01:44:50.490 --> 01:44:51.050]  For sure.
[01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:53.470]  Yeah.
[01:44:55.610 --> 01:44:57.690]  I mean, everyone's got their own.
[01:44:57.930 --> 01:44:58.430]  Yeah.
[01:45:00.490 --> 01:45:03.370]  I mean, everyone's got their own gig.
[01:45:03.370 --> 01:45:04.330]  Everyone's got their own bag.
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:13.120]  I just want to grow herb and honestly,
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:17.520]  the industry is making that harder and harder.
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:19.280]  I don't know where that's headed.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:25.040]  That's one of, I don't know about you, but that's one of my bigger concerns.
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:33.770]  I mean, I mean, my, I share that concern.
[01:45:34.730 --> 01:45:40.570]  And the biggest piece of advice that I give people in the industry is to not hesitate
[01:45:40.570 --> 01:45:42.490]  getting a job outside of the industry.
[01:45:43.450 --> 01:45:43.950]  Yeah.
[01:45:46.170 --> 01:45:53.850]  And to be able to stop for a year and know that it's not going to kill you.
[01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:58.090]  Because I mean, honestly, I grew for years and years and years and years and years.
[01:45:58.650 --> 01:46:04.730]  Never once did not have a have a light on ever for years.
[01:46:04.730 --> 01:46:09.530]  And I remember the first time I didn't have plants growing and I was like, like, I felt
[01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:11.210]  like I didn't have like purpose in life.
[01:46:11.210 --> 01:46:13.210]  I was like, Oh my God, I don't have a garden.
[01:46:13.210 --> 01:46:14.570]  Like, what am I going to do?
[01:46:15.450 --> 01:46:19.930]  And it's like, I mean, you can just get another plant and then put a light on and then you
[01:46:19.930 --> 01:46:20.970]  have a light back on again.
[01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:27.050]  It's like, we garden for so long that we think that this is the only way and that we can't
[01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:28.330]  stop, we can't take a break.
[01:46:28.330 --> 01:46:32.250]  And it's like, you can take a break for a year or 10 years or whatever and come right
[01:46:32.250 --> 01:46:32.810]  back to it.
[01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:35.690]  It's like, you don't have to go every single year, no matter what.
[01:46:36.250 --> 01:46:44.010]  And that might be a good thing in the industry is to wait until things shake out a little
[01:46:44.010 --> 01:46:47.210]  bit and then jump into like more of a legal framework.
[01:46:47.290 --> 01:46:47.850]  I don't know.
[01:46:47.850 --> 01:46:51.130]  I don't know many people who are happy in the legal framework.
[01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:55.610]  I don't know many people who are happy in the illegal framework either.
[01:46:57.610 --> 01:47:05.770]  So like for me, if my goal is to be happy, then you know, I'm gonna find a way to do
[01:47:05.770 --> 01:47:09.930]  things that makes me happy because I don't want to be growing weed legally and be miserable
[01:47:09.930 --> 01:47:12.410]  and I don't want to be growing it illegally and be miserable too.
[01:47:12.650 --> 01:47:19.290]  So that's, yeah, that's kind of my take on it is, you know, to not be afraid to do other
[01:47:19.290 --> 01:47:22.170]  things or, you know, come back to her.
[01:47:22.170 --> 01:47:26.090]  Like that's why I'm breeding is because then I can really take the time to make things
[01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:26.810]  that I want.
[01:47:27.530 --> 01:47:30.970]  And that I, you know, may, you know, really take the time to do it.
[01:47:32.970 --> 01:47:37.770]  Because yeah, I mean, when I was, you know, I was a young adult, I was a young adult
[01:47:38.730 --> 01:47:54.730]  and I still have homies that are doing it nonstop.
[01:47:54.730 --> 01:48:00.650]  Like I have homies who are like, it was like, dude, he's like, I still have the same hoods,
[01:48:00.650 --> 01:48:05.850]  the same everything from when we worked together eight years ago, the same stuff.
[01:48:08.250 --> 01:48:10.890]  Still, that's what he does.
[01:48:12.650 --> 01:48:14.570]  And I don't know.
[01:48:15.530 --> 01:48:20.650]  I mean, if you get three grand a pound, it's different from when it's a thousand dollars
[01:48:20.650 --> 01:48:21.130]  a pound.
[01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:28.010]  So I don't know.
[01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:28.570]  Yeah, and actually.
[01:48:30.090 --> 01:48:35.290]  And I mean, honestly, that's why like I do stuff like, you know, do podcasts to like
[01:48:35.290 --> 01:48:37.610]  have like my seed club, you know?
[01:48:38.010 --> 01:48:43.370]  It's like I find ways to be part of weed and to be able to like get enjoyment out of it.
[01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:47.610]  But getting, extracting money through it.
[01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:51.450]  Is this, I don't know.
[01:48:52.090 --> 01:48:55.770]  There are easier ways to get money that I found.
[01:48:56.410 --> 01:49:00.570]  But like I still, you know, I'm in the game and do shit and you know what I mean?
[01:49:01.370 --> 01:49:05.530]  But a lot of times the money isn't the centered part of it.
[01:49:06.170 --> 01:49:10.000]  So yeah, I agree with you.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.160]  The industry is in a weird place.
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:14.720]  But it can't be.
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:22.320]  Did you notice a difference in how much you and how you felt about what you did when it
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:23.200]  became legal?
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:26.480]  Well, yeah.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:32.880]  I mean, once I started, like whenever I worked for a facility, the amount of enjoyment that
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:35.200]  I got out of my own garden dropped.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.040]  Mm hmm.
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:44.480]  Because it was like, it wasn't like I get to, it wasn't like I get to garden.
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:47.040]  It was like, oh my god, I've been doing this shit all day.
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.720]  Now I have to do my own garden.
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:52.480]  Like, you know, I've been seeing weed all day and now I have my own.
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:53.200]  I don't really care.
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:55.040]  You know what I mean?
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:56.080]  Like you see tons of it.
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:59.600]  So like, less special for me.
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:00.800]  That was my own experience.
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:08.000]  I liked doing mine just because it was a place I could go and do my own, like techniques
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:08.880]  and whatnot.
[01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:11.120]  I didn't have to grow someone else's.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:15.360]  But yeah, they try to desensitize.
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:22.080]  They definitely, I don't know if they know what they're doing, but they try to desensitize.
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:26.800]  I mean, it's like I've heard more.
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:32.160]  I've heard a lot of negative things of the legal industry.
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:34.560]  I've not had a good experience in the legal industry.
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:42.240]  So it's like, and you know, in different states too, like it's just, it's a tough one.
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:49.120]  You know, like, but yeah, I mean, the people that work in the federal.
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:50.960]  How do I what?
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:54.560]  How do you feel about the possibility of federal?
[01:50:58.630 --> 01:51:01.750]  I mean, it all depends on what the punishment is for not breaking the law.
[01:51:02.710 --> 01:51:06.230]  Like, I don't know.
[01:51:06.230 --> 01:51:07.190]  It's like, it depends.
[01:51:07.190 --> 01:51:10.710]  Like, if it's just like decriminalized and you can grow whatever.
[01:51:10.710 --> 01:51:11.510]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:18.630]  If it's just like federally legal, but you, you know, if you don't grow, you get fine
[01:51:18.630 --> 01:51:21.030]  crazy amounts of money, no matter where you are.
[01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:22.710]  Like that would not be cool.
[01:51:22.710 --> 01:51:24.470]  If they kind of leave it up to the states.
[01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:27.350]  And you know what I mean?
[01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:30.790]  Like, I happen to live in a friendly area.
[01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:36.470]  So like, where we live, that's not really an issue unless you're just like doing way
[01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.950]  too much.
[01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:41.910]  So, you know, it's like, I'm spoiled.
[01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:42.550]  You know what I mean?
[01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:43.990]  Like where I live, it's chill.
[01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:47.270]  We live in the Bay Area, California, like they don't really care about that.
[01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:51.350]  But what's fucked up is let's say you go to Mendo.
[01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:57.510]  They might care about, you know, more than six plants more than they do in other parts
[01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:58.470]  of the Bay Area.
[01:52:00.150 --> 01:52:03.910]  Yeah, like some parts of Mendo, it's like, if you don't have a license, six plants, that's
[01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:04.410]  it.
[01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:07.590]  Like they don't, they're not cool with anything else.
[01:52:08.230 --> 01:52:15.670]  Other places, you know, you're respectful, you're whatever, there's all kinds of poverty
[01:52:15.670 --> 01:52:18.710]  and crazy shit going on that they're actually worried about.
[01:52:22.150 --> 01:52:23.750]  So I mean, it depends.
[01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:28.470]  Like, yeah, like this person says, like, I would be for decriminalization, where it's
[01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:35.030]  like, you know, anybody can sell weed.
[01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:37.910]  It may not be worth anything, but you can do whatever you want.
[01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:39.190]  Grow how many plants you want.
[01:52:39.190 --> 01:52:39.990]  Nobody cares.
[01:52:40.630 --> 01:52:48.390]  That's what I think would be, that's decriminalization, not like only you can grow it or you can't.
[01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:50.790]  Or like, okay, grow like 100 plants.
[01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:54.390]  Anybody, any property can have 100 plants on it.
[01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:58.150]  That, I think that would be excellent.
[01:52:58.150 --> 01:52:58.790]  Yeah.
[01:52:58.790 --> 01:53:03.430]  Because I mean, like in the, you know, like in Oakland, it was like, right, like, you
[01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:05.830]  know, like famous Oakland was 99, right?
[01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:06.550]  Forever.
[01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:07.670]  It was like 99.
[01:53:07.670 --> 01:53:11.350]  As long as you had under 99, no problem.
[01:53:12.790 --> 01:53:21.270]  But even if we, even if you had over 99, it was like, you know, it's like,
[01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:23.190]  don't blow it up.
[01:53:23.190 --> 01:53:24.150]  Don't steal power.
[01:53:25.190 --> 01:53:26.710]  Don't do the crazy shit.
[01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:31.270]  You know, pay your bills, don't have garbage.
[01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:34.470]  Just like common sense.
[01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:38.790]  And if your shit was too blown up, then you'd get, the police would come.
[01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:40.630]  So you don't blow it up.
[01:53:40.630 --> 01:53:45.350]  And you know, the people who would grow made sure that their lawn was mowed.
[01:53:46.230 --> 01:53:51.110]  Make sure that they paid all the bills on time and make sure that your house didn't
[01:53:51.110 --> 01:53:52.630]  look trapped out.
[01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:54.710]  That's what you did.
[01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:58.630]  So, I don't know.
[01:53:58.630 --> 01:54:03.350]  That's my rant on like on the Bay Area or, you know, growing.
[01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:09.910]  Should just be, or I mean, another interesting way of doing it is having it be like a certain
[01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:11.190]  amount of watts.
[01:54:11.190 --> 01:54:16.870]  So you could have like 2000 watts indoors per house.
[01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:20.310]  And it didn't matter how many plants you had or some shit like that.
[01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:24.550]  So it's like, you know, you can divide up your watts and you're like, you know, we think
[01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:31.190]  that a house could safely have this many watts of electricity that's donated to, you know,
[01:54:31.190 --> 01:54:32.150]  cannabis growth.
[01:54:32.150 --> 01:54:33.590]  And you can divide your shit up.
[01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:37.910]  And, you know, I mean, really the watts is what dictates how much you can yield.
[01:54:38.630 --> 01:54:46.630]  So as long as you had, you know, a 2000, 3000 watt limit, I mean, you could for sure with
[01:54:46.630 --> 01:54:52.870]  a 2000 flowering and 1000 veg, I mean, you could be doing like at least a pound every
[01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:53.190]  month.
[01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:59.910]  Like to me as like a conservative, like every house did that, like that could be enough
[01:54:59.910 --> 01:55:01.750]  for you to need to smell per month.
[01:55:02.630 --> 01:55:07.670]  And theoretically, I mean, you could even trade that and make, do just fine.
[01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:10.310]  So I don't know, that's, that's it.
[01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:13.590]  Jamal was for Ministry of Cannabis Consumption.
[01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:16.150]  Yeah.
[01:55:18.630 --> 01:55:26.710]  With 3000 watts, I mean, yeah, I could find a way to make that, you know, to stretch that
[01:55:26.710 --> 01:55:27.430]  out a little bit.
[01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:33.030]  But incorporating the sunlight would be like invaluable.
[01:55:33.910 --> 01:55:38.790]  I don't know how they can't regulate, you know, the plants you grow by the sun by wattage.
[01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:41.510]  Oh, no, I mean, like if it was indoors.
[01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:47.190]  And then here, this is a funny, yeah, one of my homies.
[01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:52.070]  So yeah, if you get a humidifier and a dryer and an AC cooler.
[01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.830]  Yeah, I mean, you can.
[01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:55.190]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:55:55.190 --> 01:55:58.390]  I mean, those ones would also help you yield more for sure.
[01:55:58.950 --> 01:56:04.390]  But that's hence why I don't like to use those kinds of things is because, I don't know,
[01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:09.990]  I just feel like it pulls so much power to make your cannabis better, which is not my
[01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.550]  favorite.
[01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:20.470]  Well, shoot, man, we're right about, right about there.
[01:56:25.110 --> 01:56:26.470]  Is there anything else you wanted to?
[01:56:28.710 --> 01:56:29.510]  To chat about?
[01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:34.550]  Uh, yeah, I don't know.
[01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:43.190]  I'm just want to go back to the topic real quick of my buddy, Natty Farmyard, and just
[01:56:43.190 --> 01:56:49.830]  say, yeah, you know, I don't I don't want to say too much for for the man because he's
[01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:51.750]  a wealth of information and knowledge.
[01:56:51.830 --> 01:57:00.070]  And I'll I'll see what I can do and see how his Internet is out there as far as being
[01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:01.750]  able to come in and talk next time.
[01:57:02.630 --> 01:57:10.230]  Because, yeah, I know I'm pretty I get some pretty ambivalent answers sometimes about
[01:57:10.230 --> 01:57:10.730]  things.
[01:57:11.530 --> 01:57:13.530]  But yeah, you know, he.
[01:57:16.410 --> 01:57:23.130]  He and I had wanted at one point to work on making like videos for.
[01:57:26.490 --> 01:57:31.610]  Grow instruction in the out in the Caribbean, you know, it's kind of like the ways that
[01:57:31.610 --> 01:57:37.690]  we do things, you know, a little bit different to mediate certain issues of humidity and
[01:57:37.690 --> 01:57:38.650]  things like that.
[01:57:39.530 --> 01:57:47.610]  And he showed me a lot of different things that I still use today and one.
[01:57:48.730 --> 01:57:51.210]  And he's really the guy to talk to.
[01:57:51.930 --> 01:58:00.490]  And I'm hoping next time as long as you have me back, I'll I'll get him with me.
[01:58:00.490 --> 01:58:05.370]  We'll get some content up on his site because it just popped up.
[01:58:05.370 --> 01:58:09.370]  But if anyone wants to give it a follow, it's Natty Farmyard.
[01:58:10.970 --> 01:58:16.410]  And it's pretty new, so you should be able to recognize that for a minute.
[01:58:18.330 --> 01:58:26.410]  And that's really that's about it as far as in this specific I have.
[01:58:27.210 --> 01:58:31.210]  I was going to add, I would love to have you on again.
[01:58:33.210 --> 01:58:35.450]  And if your homie is not able to.
[01:58:36.730 --> 01:58:41.770]  If we're not able to get the right connection, he can even do videos and just send me the
[01:58:41.770 --> 01:58:42.330]  videos.
[01:58:44.250 --> 01:58:48.490]  I can definitely get you content sent for sure.
[01:58:49.770 --> 01:58:51.610]  And, you know, that's not that way.
[01:58:52.410 --> 01:58:53.450]  Yeah, he's got a great.
[01:58:53.850 --> 01:58:55.290]  You know, that's not that way.
[01:58:56.010 --> 01:58:59.930]  Yeah, if he was just like wanted to like, you know, talk on a subject, walk through
[01:58:59.930 --> 01:59:02.810]  his garden, show us whatever's going on.
[01:59:03.450 --> 01:59:05.930]  You know, that would be another way of getting through it.
[01:59:05.930 --> 01:59:11.690]  But I mean, I was saying before, initially, you know, like, originally, the show was going
[01:59:11.690 --> 01:59:14.090]  to be about land race breeding.
[01:59:14.090 --> 01:59:17.290]  It's just difficult to get people on.
[01:59:17.290 --> 01:59:20.650]  And, you know, I mean, it's just a difficult subject to get a lot of content for.
[01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:23.690]  I'm still working on a land race mafia too.
[01:59:23.690 --> 01:59:25.850]  He'll find a time eventually I have faith.
[01:59:27.450 --> 01:59:30.890]  And also like the same thing with him, if he'd be interested in, you know, like doing
[01:59:30.890 --> 01:59:37.370]  a video, you know, whatever with like, let's say a mask on or whatnot, talking, you know,
[01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:39.050]  they can always send it to us that way.
[01:59:39.050 --> 01:59:41.930]  And we can, you know, even just play videos on here.
[01:59:43.450 --> 01:59:47.770]  So yeah, we can do what, you know, any way to get the media over here, but I would love
[01:59:47.770 --> 01:59:48.890]  to have them both on.
[01:59:51.610 --> 01:59:53.050]  Yeah, I'd love to have them both on.
[01:59:53.050 --> 01:59:53.850]  That'd be really awesome.
[01:59:55.530 --> 01:59:57.210]  Yeah, because really.
[02:00:00.650 --> 02:00:05.050]  I've just been limiting what I plant and stuff, so I don't even have that many land races
[02:00:05.050 --> 02:00:08.250]  to go over right now and discuss.
[02:00:08.250 --> 02:00:13.290]  So it would be better to have the people from the countries and whatnot.
[02:00:14.090 --> 02:00:22.890]  And I would like to, I would like to see each of them get their due time being asked questions
[02:00:22.890 --> 02:00:23.450]  and whatnot.
[02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:28.810]  So yeah, let's let's let's make that happen.
[02:00:30.170 --> 02:00:31.850]  Yeah, let's just put the energy out there.
[02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:34.730]  I would I would be super juiced to make that happen.
[02:00:34.730 --> 02:00:37.930]  I think I hit a land race mafia and they were like into it.
[02:00:37.930 --> 02:00:40.730]  But you know, everybody's so busy this time of year.
[02:00:43.530 --> 02:00:47.610]  Yeah, well, shoot, man, I appreciate you coming on.
[02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:53.050]  Yeah, no, I appreciate it.
[02:00:53.050 --> 02:00:54.890]  You know, I thought it was a really good show.
[02:00:54.890 --> 02:00:59.450]  I think I really like following your story.
[02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:06.010]  You know, although it seems difficult, I learn a lot from the different things that you share
[02:01:06.010 --> 02:01:08.010]  about your experience growing in Oklahoma.
[02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:13.850]  Oh yeah, you gotta take the bad with the good and laugh about it.
[02:01:14.730 --> 02:01:19.930]  Yeah, so I mean, you know, I just want to say props to you because I think you were
[02:01:19.930 --> 02:01:24.970]  like when you're getting your stuff figured out, was talking about how honestly our growing
[02:01:24.970 --> 02:01:26.410]  experience is a lot easier.
[02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:31.370]  And, you know, respect for going forward.
[02:01:32.090 --> 02:01:35.770]  You know, respect for going through that because I mean, it's heart crushing to like,
[02:01:36.650 --> 02:01:39.770]  put in all this work and then this and then that.
[02:01:39.770 --> 02:01:46.810]  It's like, you know, I should say, you know, the overriding message.
[02:01:48.810 --> 02:01:50.650]  Because yeah, I'm smoking weed while we're talking.
[02:01:50.650 --> 02:01:52.970]  So get in my head a little bit more.
[02:01:53.530 --> 02:01:58.250]  The overall message is don't give up.
[02:01:58.250 --> 02:01:59.050]  You know what I mean?
[02:01:59.050 --> 02:02:01.290]  Like keep on rocking it out.
[02:02:01.690 --> 02:02:06.010]  If the place you're at is not giving you the proper environment or something, you know
[02:02:06.010 --> 02:02:06.330]  what I mean?
[02:02:06.330 --> 02:02:08.810]  Don't think you won't be able to find another one.
[02:02:08.810 --> 02:02:14.170]  If it's like you want to grow outdoors or something and if you just don't have a place
[02:02:14.170 --> 02:02:16.250]  to grow indoors, you will.
[02:02:16.250 --> 02:02:16.970]  You know what I mean?
[02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:17.210]  Like.
[02:02:18.970 --> 02:02:19.450]  100%.
[02:02:21.210 --> 02:02:23.770]  But it can be pretty badass too.
[02:02:23.770 --> 02:02:28.970]  So 100%, you know, like we just, you know, like me and my family purchased our house.
[02:02:29.050 --> 02:02:35.770]  And so like, we finally have like a secure place to grow and it's such a nice feeling.
[02:02:35.770 --> 02:02:41.450]  But I can tell you in the past 20 years, I've had many different experiences growing.
[02:02:42.570 --> 02:02:44.890]  Many, many, many, you know, that were not.
[02:02:44.890 --> 02:02:45.370]  I can imagine.
[02:02:46.570 --> 02:02:46.970]  Yeah.
[02:02:46.970 --> 02:02:50.010]  So it makes when you have something nice, even that much better.
[02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:52.250]  Absolutely.
[02:02:53.770 --> 02:02:54.250]  So yeah.
[02:02:54.250 --> 02:02:57.850]  It's always good to have something to work for.
[02:02:58.650 --> 02:02:59.450]  Having everything.
[02:03:00.810 --> 02:03:01.690]  That's gotta suck.
[02:03:01.690 --> 02:03:01.850]  Yeah.
[02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:03.610]  It's gotta be boring.
[02:03:04.650 --> 02:03:06.730]  And you know, for sure.
[02:03:06.730 --> 02:03:11.450]  And like, you know, like sometimes I'll consult with people and so like it's cool because
[02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:16.170]  their gardens are usually like an hour or two in a different location than mine.
[02:03:16.730 --> 02:03:21.930]  And so like we'll get a chance to see similar things in like a slightly different environment,
[02:03:22.890 --> 02:03:24.410]  which is always really neat.
[02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:27.850]  And to, you know, like just keep, you know, like with outdoors when it's in different
[02:03:27.850 --> 02:03:31.050]  environments, it's, you know, you can usually tell a difference.
[02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:33.690]  Somebody said, what's your IG handle?
[02:03:38.250 --> 02:03:41.610]  Mulberry.tree.ishents.
[02:03:42.570 --> 02:03:44.970]  I S H E N T S.
[02:03:50.650 --> 02:03:58.090]  There will, you'll probably see an old one that's got underscores on it that I, it just,
[02:03:58.730 --> 02:04:02.250]  I don't know what happened to my password, but it doesn't recognize it anymore.
[02:04:02.250 --> 02:04:03.290]  And it logged me out.
[02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:07.770]  So that's got my grow from all like last year and everything on it.
[02:04:08.490 --> 02:04:11.290]  If you want to check that out too, you know, it's not like a hack.
[02:04:12.090 --> 02:04:18.330]  It's not like a password or anything, but the one that I currently post on has the dots
[02:04:18.330 --> 02:04:20.570]  between the words, not the underscores.
[02:04:22.570 --> 02:04:23.130]  Awesome.
[02:04:23.130 --> 02:04:24.890]  Mulberry.tree.ishents.
[02:04:25.530 --> 02:04:26.090]  Awesome.
[02:04:27.930 --> 02:04:31.050]  Well, shoot, I guess we're going to end this show.
[02:04:33.210 --> 02:04:33.610]  Yeah.
[02:04:33.610 --> 02:04:39.530]  Thanks, you know, everybody for watching and listening and thanks Doja for coming on.
[02:04:42.570 --> 02:04:44.810]  Continue to have some interesting conversations.
[02:04:46.650 --> 02:04:47.370]  Absolutely.
[02:04:48.170 --> 02:04:52.090]  Thank you for having me on and I'm trying to get better at doing these lives.
[02:04:53.770 --> 02:04:54.650]  Yeah, it's all good.
[02:04:54.650 --> 02:04:59.050]  I mean, it's, you know, like it, you know, it is what it is.
[02:05:01.290 --> 02:05:06.410]  You know, it's, I appreciate people taking time out of their day to, you know, to talk and,
[02:05:07.130 --> 02:05:10.250]  you know, people in the chat, Raider Nation, thank you.
[02:05:10.330 --> 02:05:14.010]  You know, people being positive in the chat and not being, you know, ridiculous.
[02:05:14.010 --> 02:05:17.770]  It's, you know, as long as we have that, it's, you know, I think it's great.
[02:05:17.770 --> 02:05:23.850]  And yeah, I, yeah, have you guys have a nice day.
[02:05:25.770 --> 02:05:26.650]  Right on.
[02:05:26.650 --> 02:05:27.290]  Have a good one.
[02:05:28.410 --> 02:05:29.210]  Later.
[02:05:29.210 --> 02:05:30.570]  Thank you all.
