[00:13.370 --> 00:19.730]  Hello everybody and welcome to another episode of the Friendly Cannabis Show.
[00:19.730 --> 00:25.730]  I am super stoked today. I've got one of my friends with me here and we're ready
[00:25.730 --> 00:33.450]  to BS about all things cannabis. Mark Smith from SensiSeeds, world traveler,
[00:33.450 --> 00:39.250]  cool freaking guy. The guy I like to call my friend. How you doing today Mark?
[00:39.250 --> 00:43.210]  As he lights up. That's the classic interviewer thing is wait till they take
[00:43.210 --> 00:48.490]  a toke and then ask a question. Well thanks very much for having the time to
[00:48.490 --> 00:52.090]  sit down and have a conversation man. That's really awesome. I'm doing
[00:52.090 --> 00:56.230]  really well thank you very much. It's nine o'clock over here so quite a late
[00:56.230 --> 01:01.010]  one for me although it's a Saturday. No doing really good man doing really good
[01:01.010 --> 01:04.970]  everything. You know it's been a lovely October here in Amsterdam and
[01:04.970 --> 01:08.490]  Hilversum man in the North Holland. You know it's been 18
[01:08.490 --> 01:13.290]  yesterday 18 today man it's been beautiful you know it's something that
[01:13.290 --> 01:17.930]  we never really see you know. Usually by this time we're knee-deep in rain and
[01:17.930 --> 01:25.770]  you know. Me too, me too this time of year. We're pretty much the same like
[01:25.770 --> 01:31.730]  latitude, longitude. We're one of those ellitudes. Same difference there but I
[01:31.730 --> 01:35.790]  was reading an article the other day that yeah Amsterdam had the hottest
[01:35.790 --> 01:42.670]  October 28th that they've ever had on record. So it's been no complaints.
[01:42.670 --> 01:48.150]  Yeah no complaints. That's like you know because so I was there me and my wife
[01:48.150 --> 01:52.350]  were there in May and you know that's when we got to see you and we actually
[01:52.350 --> 01:56.790]  haven't really like talked talked since then so everybody gets to catch up with
[01:56.790 --> 02:02.910]  us. It was gorgeous weather then too. Man you know you guys came at such a
[02:02.990 --> 02:07.510]  perfect time because a week before you guys came it was just torrential rain. It
[02:07.510 --> 02:11.390]  was dull it was dismal and then you guys brought that brought that lovely
[02:11.390 --> 02:17.470]  northwestern weather with you. We bring the sunshine everywhere we go. So
[02:17.470 --> 02:20.990]  alright the one thing and this is something that I kind of started with
[02:20.990 --> 02:28.670]  with Tommy Chong is I like dad jokes. I like bad movies and I like bad jokes. So
[02:28.670 --> 02:34.750]  I figured we'll get this one started with a bad. Now you're familiar with the
[02:34.750 --> 02:42.950]  movie Frozen right? That Disney movie and you've seen that one. Frozen? Yeah.
[02:42.950 --> 02:51.190]  Maybe with Kim possibly. Okay it's a yeah it's a Disney movie and hopefully
[02:51.190 --> 02:57.710]  some of the people in chat have seen it but it completely sets up my joke. So my
[02:57.710 --> 03:08.910]  joke being why don't you give Elsa your prized cannabis clone because she'll
[03:08.910 --> 03:18.990]  just let it go let it go. Alright that's number one.
[03:18.990 --> 03:30.430]  Hey don't worry guys I have more of them coming. Stay tuned. You know you will.
[03:30.430 --> 03:39.150]  So you know real quick I guess of anywhere we could start you know I want
[03:39.150 --> 03:42.390]  to give a shout out real quick to Diamond District 420 and the Mountain
[03:42.390 --> 03:46.830]  Fire Genetics. I was doing an interview or they were interviewing me yesterday I
[03:46.910 --> 03:53.790]  was a guest with them. For once the tables have turned. They were it was weird. Well I mean it
[03:53.790 --> 03:57.550]  was fun it was awesome it was really good time and then we got about like 45
[03:57.550 --> 04:01.670]  minutes deep into it and Mountain Fire Genetics started talking about some of
[04:01.670 --> 04:04.870]  the breeding work he does. I'm like well wait a minute I'm usually the interviewer
[04:04.870 --> 04:12.670]  here let's let's flip the script. But I had to go. But one of the questions that
[04:12.670 --> 04:18.910]  came up then and that comes up very frequently for me is dude how did you
[04:18.910 --> 04:23.870]  start writing for Scenty Seeds? And I go back to the same story you
[04:23.870 --> 04:30.630]  know yeah you were there shit. But you know Scenty Seeds it has always been you
[04:30.630 --> 04:34.270]  know and I was saying yesterday it's like you know I was drawing a little pot
[04:34.270 --> 04:40.150]  leaf and the logo on my binder in school. So when we made it to Amsterdam we had
[04:40.150 --> 04:46.510]  to go and go get into the store and Mark was there working and I you know I
[04:46.510 --> 04:50.670]  was joking like I kind of almost felt bad for him because I walk in and I see
[04:50.670 --> 04:53.430]  a hoodie I'm like I want one of those. I see a t-shirt I'm like I want one of
[04:53.430 --> 04:57.030]  those. Oh there's a hat I want one of those. Growing paperless at Scenty Seeds I want one of those.
[04:57.030 --> 05:05.750]  And then I was you know looking looking at a few other things and went
[05:05.750 --> 05:14.630]  down to Amnesia coffee shop. We had some some apple apple Amnesia apple and I
[05:14.630 --> 05:20.390]  think a strawberry Amnesia. But dude we got like high school high and we came
[05:20.390 --> 05:25.390]  back and you were freaking awesome to talk to because you have a good like
[05:25.390 --> 05:30.430]  cannabis background and a good cannabis knowledge. Like we had a good
[05:30.430 --> 05:35.910]  conversation about the many assets of it. Absolutely for around for at least
[05:35.910 --> 05:41.550]  over an hour I think we we stood there we stood there kind of conversating. It
[05:41.550 --> 05:46.030]  was it was awesome I know it's really good because you know it's really good
[05:46.030 --> 05:48.430]  to see come on especially from there from the States to come in man and to
[05:48.430 --> 05:51.430]  really have that knowledge and to really be able to connect on that level I
[05:51.430 --> 05:54.230]  think is absolutely amazing man that's why that's what it's all about the
[05:54.230 --> 05:59.750]  the connections in the cannabis industry right there. Yeah. Where it is the community man.
[06:00.150 --> 06:05.110]  The plants you know the plants a connector it's it's a universal language
[06:05.110 --> 06:10.270]  you know and it was funny as you know I was trying to give you trying to give
[06:10.270 --> 06:13.310]  you like my contact information while we're talking and I'm sitting there
[06:13.310 --> 06:15.710]  instead of writing my contact information I'm writing what I'm
[06:15.710 --> 06:25.150]  actually saying I was like that's stone. It was man the hazes though over there
[06:25.150 --> 06:31.190]  like we absolutely love the hazes in the Netherlands like boom that's a
[06:31.190 --> 06:34.990]  rebroadhead sir yeah yeah I should probably ask what are you smoking on
[06:34.990 --> 06:38.710]  right now I am just smoking on some of my Jack I
[06:38.710 --> 06:43.790]  rather have a homegrown that turned out really nice actually some really nice
[06:43.790 --> 06:47.670]  I've just actually germinated two more Jack errors as well and I've got
[06:47.670 --> 06:53.590]  something else got four on the go just just popped out the ceiling yesterday
[06:53.590 --> 06:57.350]  man then just just pop them yesterday and they're looking really nice but not
[06:57.350 --> 07:00.310]  just some Jack and I've also got a bit of the local the amnesia block cash you
[07:00.310 --> 07:06.510]  know it's a big a big cash you know just sprinkle a little bit on me you know a
[07:06.510 --> 07:12.950]  little bit everybody let me tell you what his little bit is it's a fucking
[07:12.950 --> 07:20.230]  snake the size of a cigarette which I wasn't complaining it's so smooth man
[07:20.230 --> 07:25.510]  there you know it I just love that it's really nice and as the the Jack came out
[07:25.510 --> 07:29.790]  really nice man it's really nice some really nice turps and this with that
[07:29.790 --> 07:34.510]  hash is just a just to ease me off a bit for the night time
[07:34.510 --> 07:42.350]  yeah I'm actually smoking some Jack's cleaner too so we're we're on the same
[07:42.350 --> 07:49.550]  branch of the tree right now that's kind of cool so yeah smoking some of the Jack's
[07:49.630 --> 07:54.310]  cleaner to haven't haven't tossed any hash in here but then again it is the
[07:54.310 --> 07:59.510]  morning and it's Saturday and it's harder to find in the States obviously
[07:59.510 --> 08:05.630]  there's some nice hash there is a you would be surprised like I could go and
[08:05.630 --> 08:13.950]  get you know 82% concentrates but I can't get some good pressed hash like it
[08:13.950 --> 08:18.070]  just doesn't exist over here you know you get the best live resins the best
[08:18.070 --> 08:22.270]  sauces everything but some good old-fashioned some chair essence and
[08:22.270 --> 08:29.310]  nice and nice press that yeah yeah that was one of the things that you know we
[08:29.310 --> 08:34.270]  were excited to get there it was you know the hazes the white widow and the
[08:34.270 --> 08:42.990]  hash which coincidentally is like not the the hot mover in Amsterdam or
[08:42.990 --> 08:46.350]  whatever because you know we see the you know the the cookies menu or whatever
[08:46.350 --> 08:54.830]  like $30 grams of gelato I'm ridiculous this this USA strains that are not USA
[08:54.830 --> 09:00.230]  strains are grown in the Netherlands that are Cali which is which is just
[09:00.230 --> 09:04.470]  just a sham man you know and it's a shame you know because people people
[09:04.470 --> 09:08.390]  people have come to Amsterdam they trust too much you know they think well
[09:08.390 --> 09:12.950]  I'm Sam's gotta be you know is a tourist Mecca but with no regulations and and
[09:13.950 --> 09:18.270]  and laws that haven't changed in almost 30 years you know I think you know
[09:18.270 --> 09:22.350]  there's a lot of it's a it's a shame and you especially with the connoisseurs you
[09:22.350 --> 09:26.310]  know the enthusiasts you know exactly what it's all about you know and you
[09:26.310 --> 09:33.430]  know it's no way they like 30 years a cram you insane super insane and like
[09:33.430 --> 09:38.350]  you know the the white widow and the amnesia's you know they're like typically
[09:38.350 --> 09:43.590]  it was about $10 maybe $12 a gram which is what you're gonna pay in the States
[09:43.590 --> 09:49.350]  in a legal state for you know pretty good there's definitely your six and
[09:49.350 --> 09:52.910]  your eight dollar grams but ten to twelve really is the range of where
[09:52.910 --> 09:57.390]  you're like yeah I'll smoke that they're looking for your high grade for a right
[09:57.390 --> 10:03.310]  yeah yeah I mean the prices prices do go up but they're definitely not as high as
[10:03.550 --> 10:08.910]  over there but that probably does you know Amsterdam for a lot of many years
[10:08.910 --> 10:16.510]  was was the tourist you know cannabis tourism destination and I think they you
[10:16.510 --> 10:21.150]  know it's slipped a little bit but they will always have people coming to
[10:21.150 --> 10:27.310]  experience cannabis so the newbie loves that it's it's always gonna be the
[10:27.310 --> 10:30.830]  matter you know even though the things have changed I think now Barcelona was
[10:30.830 --> 10:36.350]  it is the new Amsterdam you know everyone's got us like you said when
[10:36.350 --> 10:39.550]  everyone's got a soft spot for Amsterdam you know it's always gonna be the the
[10:39.550 --> 10:43.790]  city of the pioneer D you know the the really brought it to everywhere the
[10:43.790 --> 10:47.710]  attention of the of a lot of people man you know it was a oh you're gonna get
[10:47.710 --> 10:52.790]  out somebody gotta smoke some weed man yeah you know everyone either everyone
[10:52.790 --> 10:57.470]  here if you get out with that you know you enjoy having a good smoke right like
[10:57.470 --> 11:02.230]  and and still man I see so many tourists who just come here for the smoke man but
[11:02.230 --> 11:06.070]  sometimes you know we were in the college you know and we have a big big
[11:06.070 --> 11:08.470]  map I think you made a story when he came in the college of all over the
[11:08.470 --> 11:11.070]  coffee shops of all over the city you know for the for the people who come
[11:11.070 --> 11:18.230]  there but it's just saying that there's no work excuse me there's no regulation
[11:18.230 --> 11:25.190]  man people need to be on the same level man right like growing I think that's
[11:25.230 --> 11:29.990]  it's kind of crazy so tonight break it down for everybody who's not familiar
[11:29.990 --> 11:35.270]  with the system they're essentially cannabis once it enters the coffee shop
[11:35.270 --> 11:42.310]  is legal but it's not really legal until it gets into the coffee shop absolutely
[11:42.310 --> 11:46.790]  so and there there's there's personal grow right but I mean that's not gonna
[11:46.790 --> 11:51.350]  supply a coffee shop but as like citizens you were able to do five plants
[11:51.350 --> 11:56.470]  outside without any complaints from the neighbors so outside that's perfect
[11:56.470 --> 11:59.310]  that's perfectly okay so example because a lot of place in Holland you know you
[11:59.310 --> 12:02.510]  go outside Amsterdam we're in the country so you're perfectly allowed to
[12:02.510 --> 12:05.550]  define which is awesome you know how big can you plant me you know we'd get five
[12:05.550 --> 12:11.670]  plants all outside even better yeah but when it comes to you know having a
[12:11.670 --> 12:15.470]  having a couple of lights and a couple of tents that people might have who
[12:15.470 --> 12:21.110]  knows you know apparently that's you know that that comes down that's illegal
[12:21.750 --> 12:26.630]  which is a shame so when people are buying all this all this cannabis there's
[12:26.630 --> 12:30.110]  no regulations you know that the cover shopper that's selling to cover shop
[12:30.110 --> 12:34.510]  illegally as such and it only becomes legal like you said as it enters a
[12:34.510 --> 12:40.550]  cover shop cover shops can only have 500 grams of flour on them okay at all times
[12:40.550 --> 12:45.390]  and so it's a very gray area I think there's no extractions are all illegal
[12:45.390 --> 12:49.550]  so no concentrations at all no shatters no eyes of oils nothing like that
[12:49.550 --> 12:53.830]  everything's illegal which is good as in terms of being in Amsterdam I can see
[12:53.830 --> 12:57.990]  it being why why that's a thing but it's such a shame to people who use it for a
[12:57.990 --> 13:02.270]  medicinal view medicinal you know there's no access to iris oils there's
[13:02.270 --> 13:07.150]  no there's no Harlequin there's no one-to-one one-to-one THC CBD strange
[13:07.150 --> 13:13.630]  you know the radius concentrates and I think it's a for me I'm enough you know
[13:13.630 --> 13:19.470]  the the legality of cannabis over here is interesting man and I am hopefully
[13:19.470 --> 13:24.670]  with a as you might have saw Germany they plan to legalize by 2024 which I
[13:24.670 --> 13:29.830]  think will have a massive play on nothing's gonna kick up the ass man you
[13:29.830 --> 13:36.510]  know what they need it'll be interesting to to see because for years and just
[13:36.510 --> 13:41.430]  even as recently as last month the mayor has been trying to say you know we're
[13:41.430 --> 13:44.950]  gonna cut off the coffee shop to tourists you have to be a resident and
[13:45.110 --> 13:51.190]  you know it hasn't succeeded but it's been suggested enough times that one day
[13:51.190 --> 13:57.790]  it probably will but the revenue man like revenue to the city what how ironic
[13:57.790 --> 14:01.470]  is it you know that Germany is trying to legalize it and Netherlands right here
[14:01.470 --> 14:04.670]  we're still in the same 30-year thing you know we're still trying to
[14:04.670 --> 14:09.030]  criminalize it you know and it becomes a joke to be honest man like you think yes
[14:09.030 --> 14:13.510]  and I can walk but it you know me in reality you know I can walk on a trail
[14:13.510 --> 14:17.510]  smoking a joint I can spark a woman a police they won't say anything I'm a
[14:17.510 --> 14:21.790]  smoking one with a weather weather and just walking past the police just just
[14:21.790 --> 14:26.350]  yesterday coming home you know outside the station in the street that you know
[14:26.350 --> 14:32.790]  I think it's been so normalized over here you know like you know what I
[14:32.790 --> 14:36.270]  remember when you when you first came over here and we were in company and you
[14:36.270 --> 14:41.550]  weren't sure if we could smoke outside and I said yes and I think that's
[14:41.550 --> 14:44.830]  absolutely man I think it's getting more normalized you know and and it's
[14:44.830 --> 14:48.390]  cool over here I find that you can sit down on a bench and people come in even
[14:48.390 --> 14:51.630]  if you smoking in England people to give you a very bad look won't walk 20 meters
[14:51.630 --> 14:54.430]  of you but over here you can say hey how's it going and people coming you
[14:54.430 --> 14:58.270]  know there's no discrimination I think that's awesome it's just in the politics
[14:58.270 --> 15:05.030]  and this and this in the system yeah and that was surprising too you know it's
[15:05.030 --> 15:08.430]  like around you know around here if I'm in like the big city I feel free to
[15:08.430 --> 15:12.590]  spark up anywhere but like in a smaller town where I live I am definitely not
[15:12.590 --> 15:16.710]  like sparking up on a bench even though it's legal in the state I mean you're
[15:16.710 --> 15:21.830]  not allowed to really smoke in plain view of people but that was one thing
[15:21.830 --> 15:24.790]  that we had to get used to when we're with you you meet us at the train
[15:24.790 --> 15:27.990]  station just smoking a joint or just walk it through the train station
[15:27.990 --> 15:31.910]  smoking a joint like holy shit I guess it's everywhere and yeah camping you
[15:31.910 --> 15:35.870]  know sitting on the benches on the trail people are walking their dogs people are
[15:35.870 --> 15:39.670]  riding their bikes people are going by and I mean we were responsible it's not
[15:39.670 --> 15:44.910]  like we were you know burning bushes and sacrificing guts or anything not yet
[15:44.910 --> 15:54.110]  maybe I'm a that's next trip absolutely that's cool money you know I think and I
[15:54.110 --> 15:57.510]  think wait wherever you can if people can smoke a cigarette I can smoke a
[15:57.510 --> 16:01.550]  joint man that's the way I say it dude like man if he can smoke I'm sparking up man
[16:01.550 --> 16:06.390]  I was just at my wedding I had to go back to England for me for me best
[16:06.390 --> 16:11.150]  friend's wedding it was on the Saturday and it was just outside Birmingham just
[16:11.150 --> 16:14.790]  outside a little little town called Kidderminster and it was a beautiful
[16:14.790 --> 16:20.030]  sermon man and I was outside everyone knows I smoke man and I sat outside and
[16:20.030 --> 16:24.230]  I just asked the chap next to me he was smoking a cigarette and I say do you
[16:24.230 --> 16:27.270]  mind if I and he said no do what you want and he was a police here was a
[16:27.270 --> 16:30.870]  police constable he was in a police and one of the one of the next the next
[16:30.870 --> 16:33.670]  counties and I said you know what do you what do you thought and he said to
[16:33.670 --> 16:36.230]  be honest man I think you know everyone should be able to do what they want you
[16:36.230 --> 16:39.470]  know if you're not affecting anyone personal growth should be illegal so
[16:39.470 --> 16:44.190]  should be legal and and I've done us trying to it and I said you know mine
[16:44.190 --> 16:49.550]  isn't it can't smell anything mate I said yeah awesome it was really nice
[16:49.550 --> 16:53.270]  though you know he said you know and said you know so for example you know
[16:53.270 --> 16:56.590]  what what you do if you see me smoking in the street he said if you're a nice
[16:56.590 --> 17:01.630]  guy do nothing but if you're an asshole obviously and I said absolutely when
[17:01.630 --> 17:04.710]  that's how it should be you know yeah doesn't matter what you're doing don't
[17:04.710 --> 17:08.750]  be an asshole right you know like doesn't matter if you're smoking a joint
[17:08.750 --> 17:11.910]  you know you're having a beer you're doing some don't be an asshole right I
[17:11.910 --> 17:18.830]  thought to him for a good half an hour man this chat in the think I smoked on
[17:18.830 --> 17:23.710]  me joint with him in the year Wow that's great man yeah that's an awesome
[17:23.870 --> 17:27.590]  experience to really be able to break it down and again you know it's like yeah
[17:27.590 --> 17:30.250]  if you're not being an asshole you're not disturbing things you're not in a
[17:30.250 --> 17:34.990]  preschool playground like it should be cool there are some states here like New
[17:34.990 --> 17:39.550]  York if you can smoke a cigarette you can smoke joints there but I'm in
[17:39.550 --> 17:46.110]  Washington man we are ass backwards so I've been to Washington a few times I
[17:46.110 --> 17:50.790]  love the I did the when I went living in Vancouver I have a lot of friends in San
[17:50.790 --> 17:55.430]  Diego so I drove all the way down and going through where Olympia is also I
[17:55.430 --> 17:59.550]  also visit Olympia see me walls in the throne room in some bars so that was
[17:59.550 --> 18:04.630]  really cool yeah when I got to Olympia I wasn't sure of you know where's a
[18:04.630 --> 18:10.910]  dispensary man me phone died you know classic so I saw the security guard man
[18:10.910 --> 18:13.790]  he looked really nice you know I'm gonna nicely look really partial hey man you
[18:13.790 --> 18:17.830]  know I can find a dispensary you're like dispensary I'm trying to play I said I'm
[18:17.830 --> 18:20.830]  paying for the police force yeah we can have a look for me can't you said yeah
[18:20.830 --> 18:26.110]  sure we looked up this this this dispensary and it was a there's a fair
[18:26.110 --> 18:32.270]  about ten minutes and it was really great and I said I'm what I bought my
[18:32.270 --> 18:37.430]  it was um something delicious I saw probably some gorilla glue I think
[18:37.430 --> 18:41.910]  actually which is one of me some of that heavy hits are like a nice indica man
[18:41.910 --> 18:48.910]  you know full-body heavy hits I do like yeah I'm a fan of gorilla glue as well
[18:48.910 --> 18:53.070]  because it has such a distinct profile it's like that was one you know you joke
[18:53.070 --> 18:58.070]  if like if you go to a restaurant and they like mess up your grilled cheese or
[18:58.070 --> 19:01.870]  they mess up your cheeseburger don't don't try anything else on the menu
[19:01.870 --> 19:05.070]  that's kind of like with growers I'm like if you give me something that's
[19:05.070 --> 19:09.270]  gorilla glue and I'm just like no dude I don't want to try anything else from your
[19:09.270 --> 19:14.870]  company I'm good you know I got like it's a stable dude right you know and
[19:14.870 --> 19:18.270]  it's it's distinct I know what I'm looking for you know some of some of the
[19:18.270 --> 19:22.270]  other strains are you know there's subjectivity to and they may be
[19:22.270 --> 19:29.790]  different and whatnot but yeah gorilla glue is one that nails it down to get
[19:29.790 --> 19:33.590]  back to something you were saying earlier though is you know because of
[19:33.590 --> 19:39.870]  kind of the the quasi illegality in the Netherlands like you're not able to get
[19:39.870 --> 19:44.110]  the concentrates you're not able to get the RSOs which is a shame because that
[19:44.110 --> 19:50.150]  is you know like RSO in particular is very beneficial in the medicinal aspect
[19:50.150 --> 19:55.950]  but you also mentioned CBD and that's something else that you know because it
[19:55.950 --> 20:02.030]  is kind of you know illegal still in the Netherlands when you go into a coffee
[20:02.190 --> 20:06.790]  shop you're not getting a THC percentage a CBD percentage you're not getting
[20:06.790 --> 20:12.550]  terpene profiles something that is like legally you have to do here that's my
[20:12.550 --> 20:16.590]  problem I'm coming from working for me in Canada man in the medicine industry
[20:16.590 --> 20:20.990]  in Canada and then coming over to the Spain first which is a and they come out
[20:20.990 --> 20:24.110]  of the Netherlands I was shocked man you know that I couldn't find this
[20:24.110 --> 20:27.510]  information man like you know I don't even know where it's grown man like you
[20:27.510 --> 20:32.750]  know wow like there's no cannabinoid values anything there's no and from and
[20:32.750 --> 20:35.750]  for a massive you know that's what I'm looking for you know I'm looking to see
[20:35.750 --> 20:39.230]  you know if I'm if I'm looking for some CBD heavy you know I want to see what
[20:39.230 --> 20:43.390]  better CBN awesome any about I want to see what's in it man you know and I and
[20:43.390 --> 20:46.470]  for me I think that's what everything is lacking right now and I think here at
[20:46.470 --> 20:51.910]  Sensi right now I'm trying right now to get these terpene profiles I'm going
[20:51.910 --> 20:55.630]  actually I've been in the facility I got an every Wednesday and we're really hard
[20:55.630 --> 20:58.990]  to trying to get these so I'm trying to you know I think everyone deserves to
[20:58.990 --> 21:02.310]  know the terpene profiles man you've got to know man you know and I think that
[21:02.310 --> 21:05.350]  that's what we're missing out on at the moment so this is what I'm pushing for
[21:05.350 --> 21:09.190]  next year we'll be we're moving into this territory man we can do all that
[21:09.190 --> 21:11.750]  we do a lot of cannabinoid testing as you know we do all the stuff for the
[21:11.750 --> 21:15.790]  grow reports but the terpenes man is you know is where the European market I
[21:15.790 --> 21:22.590]  think you know no one it's it's huge because when you can actually talk about
[21:22.590 --> 21:27.350]  you know potentially some of the medicinal aspects it's usually terpene
[21:27.350 --> 21:35.070]  profiles that I tell people to look for you know so since the senses will
[21:35.070 --> 21:40.470]  definitely be you know again kind of leading the charge it's it's all in the
[21:40.470 --> 21:45.150]  background right now we're aware of it but when it comes out to the public and
[21:45.150 --> 21:49.950]  they see it yeah that's it's it's a game-changer it really is a game-changer
[21:50.350 --> 21:58.590]  for taking control of your use you know man charge you you know too well manner
[21:58.590 --> 22:03.350]  you you it's some amazing article you did the surf in C did a great surfing
[22:03.350 --> 22:08.550]  serious for us here at sensei and all of the staff are absolutely overwhelmed
[22:08.550 --> 22:13.870]  yeah an orator man it was really a some really great series I'm really the the
[22:13.870 --> 22:18.910]  training series we're doing right now Chad is brilliant man we are absolutely
[22:18.910 --> 22:26.350]  brilliant man and I stoops and and then you see to you know from from the first
[22:26.350 --> 22:31.750]  time we met I can talk and write about this for hours so yeah sometimes I need
[22:31.750 --> 22:37.470]  to be reined in a little a little bit but you know I love I love this stuff so
[22:37.470 --> 22:46.510]  that's what we do you know you know real dedication and that's what we loved it
[22:46.510 --> 22:52.630]  yeah well thank you thank you I'm really glad we found each other now you
[22:52.630 --> 22:56.150]  know I kind of know a little bit about the story but for everybody else out
[22:56.150 --> 23:01.790]  there how did you kind of become involved with sensei seeds like how did
[23:01.790 --> 23:07.390]  that take place was this something that happened in Amsterdam or how did that
[23:07.390 --> 23:15.990]  start for you oh well when I how far back do you want to go you want to go

[29:29.610 --> 29:34.850]  little niche you bring them all together and holy cow we all we all grow together
[29:35.850 --> 29:39.730]  that's what it's all about right you know it's not what who is better than
[29:39.730 --> 29:42.770]  the other it's a community everything everyone although it's different
[29:42.770 --> 29:45.730]  everyone ever works together you know and I think the end of the day we all
[29:45.730 --> 29:49.610]  want the best yield we all want the best terpenes you know we want the we will
[29:49.610 --> 29:54.570]  you know it's a win-win you know like everyone there's not for me it's not
[29:54.570 --> 29:57.330]  about profit it's about me you know it's about helping people man it's about
[29:57.330 --> 30:00.930]  bringing the community together and about gaining and learning and engaging
[30:01.930 --> 30:09.530]  education education is what they speak to thousand do it then educate the
[30:09.530 --> 30:13.130]  people and you know people and we run of any problems with cannabis you know I
[30:13.130 --> 30:20.810]  want to be on the same level I think yeah yeah now you you know if I mean
[30:20.810 --> 30:24.930]  we've already mentioned we've like Canada we've got Spain we've got the
[30:24.930 --> 30:29.890]  Netherlands you've kind of traveled the world following the plant or maybe the
[30:29.890 --> 30:34.930]  plant has followed you where you've gone that's pretty cool and I remember
[30:34.930 --> 30:41.650]  you telling me stories about charis which you know or maybe you can explain
[30:41.650 --> 30:46.890]  what charis is for anybody who doesn't necessarily know and maybe just kind of
[30:46.890 --> 30:50.490]  a little bit about the process and where you were just tell us about that
[30:50.490 --> 30:55.930]  experience because that again that is not an American experience no I don't
[30:55.930 --> 31:05.690]  know yeah I traveled a lot through Southeast Asia when I when I started
[31:05.690 --> 31:11.850]  when I moved over the States I was doing a study in film movie image production
[31:11.850 --> 31:18.050]  in University in Leeds and in the first year you know we got involved with
[31:18.050 --> 31:23.450]  smoking cannabis quite heavily but I was smoking unfortunately tobacco at the
[31:23.450 --> 31:28.650]  time we were mixing in English it's a common and Europe all over unfortunately
[31:28.650 --> 31:31.810]  it's a common and you know there was something that I really enjoyed and
[31:31.810 --> 31:37.450]  there was something that I really didn't like at the same time it was it was I
[31:37.450 --> 31:42.730]  really enjoyed that and then I had the opportunity to go to America to San
[31:42.730 --> 31:46.770]  Diego to study my next year in SJSU which was absolutely amazing you know
[31:46.770 --> 31:51.930]  and that was the first time in San Diego where I saw people smoking pure you know
[31:52.090 --> 31:56.090]  and being from England loving no education previously have you know of
[31:56.090 --> 32:03.850]  anything like this being super young man I was a I soon learned the error of my
[32:03.850 --> 32:16.850]  ways and realized that shit is fucking filthy and yeah then I am yeah that was
[32:16.850 --> 32:25.170]  that fucking more than 15 no quite a while ago man over 15 years ago and then
[32:25.170 --> 32:30.130]  you know I am I completely started in a different manner you know and I started
[32:30.130 --> 32:33.530]  taking these awesome growing classes down at Mother Earth dispensary in San
[32:33.530 --> 32:38.490]  Diego and his wicked class on cloning actually in my favorite dispensary in
[32:38.490 --> 32:43.730]  San Diego well after I will go off topic a minute if you don't mind but that
[32:44.450 --> 32:48.930]  getting the medicinal card in San Diego when I was younger was a real treat I
[32:48.930 --> 32:55.450]  think I was 19 okay and we went on to this this medicinal
[32:55.450 --> 33:02.210]  medicinal clinic and I went we parted we part downstairs he plays one and then we
[33:02.210 --> 33:06.770]  went upstairs I was sitting in this waiting room sheets and chunk up in
[33:06.770 --> 33:12.210]  smoke was playing in the waiting room TV yes and after instantly this is this is
[33:12.210 --> 33:16.170]  hilarious and I and I was looking at the time and I put my name and everybody
[33:16.170 --> 33:21.090]  said you know how much time we got time for a quick yeah fuck it why not so he
[33:21.090 --> 33:25.450]  went down with us went down to the car lit one up and I came back and I was
[33:25.450 --> 33:31.490]  absolutely ripped and at that very moment the guy called my name mr. Smith
[33:31.490 --> 33:37.850]  and that's great here we go and if you know you know well you know what's your
[33:37.850 --> 33:46.130]  problem and I said bit of back pain from gardening that's that's what what
[33:46.130 --> 33:51.850]  popped a mind you know and oh yeah very serious at all yeah it is when you know
[33:51.850 --> 33:58.080]  and there it is you know any any hundred and seventy hundred and seventy dollars
[33:58.080 --> 34:06.640]  later they gave ridiculous but you know there it is and unfortunately at that
[34:06.640 --> 34:11.080]  time that's the only way to go and I was great man and then after that you
[34:11.080 --> 34:18.000]  know I came back to England and then you know the English cannabis scene is is
[34:18.000 --> 34:21.480]  pretty awesome with it that's everything's wet everything's damp and
[34:21.480 --> 34:26.080]  then there's no curing there's no there's no what happens man you just dry
[34:26.080 --> 34:31.320]  it after a week and sell it what happened to the way I'm trying man
[34:31.880 --> 34:40.680]  where's the cure man like where's the terpenes man like it's until you know
[34:40.680 --> 34:44.280]  you don't know and I always joke over here cuz you know particularly with
[34:44.280 --> 34:47.800]  outdoor everybody talks about croptober everybody's pulling their crops down
[34:47.800 --> 34:51.920]  it's harvest it's October and I'm always like don't be that guy who you know
[34:51.920 --> 34:56.240]  don't be the person who's like happy in croptober but does the no cure November
[34:56.240 --> 35:02.120]  cuz there's totally the no cure November people I'm just like guys do
[35:02.120 --> 35:05.400]  yourself just do actually do us a favor you get you don't care you don't even
[35:05.400 --> 35:11.320]  smoke this shit man that I love this I love that smell of dry hay in the
[35:11.320 --> 35:23.760]  morning and you look at anything man might look really awesome when he gets
[35:23.760 --> 35:32.360]  down to it couldn't do it so where were you so anyway after I finish uni I went
[35:32.360 --> 35:35.600]  traveling for a few years in Southeast Asia well I went to Australia for a few
[35:35.600 --> 35:42.680]  years really nice outdoor really lovely and then I went up through Southeast
[35:42.680 --> 35:46.520]  Asia so up into my buddy was living in Indonesia so it's been a long time in
[35:46.520 --> 35:53.400]  Bali spent a lot of time smoking some some cannabis from Sumatra all hermite
[35:53.560 --> 35:59.600]  all I've never seen so many seeds now this fall you could buy a bag it was so
[35:59.600 --> 36:05.880]  expensive well but the punishment is a unfortunately my friend that's a razor
[36:05.880 --> 36:09.560]  glass my buddy JJ who's in a Jakarta prison right now for a possession of
[36:09.560 --> 36:17.280]  cannabis so cheers to you man and the punishment there's no education over
[36:17.280 --> 36:21.880]  there no one knows how to grow men a lot of it comes in from Sumatra up in a
[36:22.360 --> 36:30.760]  and it's just full of seeds you know and horrible stuff I'm gonna think about it
[36:30.760 --> 36:37.720]  you know you know when you're smoking a joint and you get that if someone's
[36:37.720 --> 36:45.820]  smoking a seed like a man and making smell yeah it's been in circles where
[36:45.820 --> 36:50.740]  you're like somebody's smoking a seed who got that seed come on get out of it
[36:50.740 --> 36:58.540]  you go around searching the joints come on just wait for it to pop explode on
[36:58.540 --> 37:05.940]  them I've done that a few times but yeah no definitely no the the seeded smell
[37:05.940 --> 37:11.100]  which is crazy cuz now everybody would be clamoring for those seeds but at that
[37:11.100 --> 37:16.900]  time you just like gosh dang it get out of here get out of here man get away uh
[37:16.900 --> 37:23.820]  and people should really save some of those classics are right yes save some
[37:23.820 --> 37:28.500]  of those classic seeds man give them the pop now a lot of people are going for
[37:28.500 --> 37:33.580]  that but so I mean like Australia you mentioned I'm cannabis is pretty
[37:33.580 --> 37:37.620]  freaking illegal there and where you were just mentioning you know Jakarta
[37:37.620 --> 37:43.820]  and a lot of Southeast Asian countries the penalties can be pretty severe like
[37:43.820 --> 37:51.540]  pretty pretty high man you know severe whenever I was smoking in in Bali when I
[37:51.540 --> 37:55.620]  was I'd go into a new constructions I'd go into the highest possible place I
[37:55.620 --> 37:59.860]  climbed to the roof of a building of it ever you know just to be sure you know I
[37:59.860 --> 38:07.860]  was so no order do you know or in um in the ocean and a nice rock somewhere you
[38:07.860 --> 38:13.180]  know I was really quite quite freaked out when about smoking in there and one
[38:13.180 --> 38:17.940]  time I had this joint and we're coming back from from one of the islands I
[38:17.940 --> 38:23.820]  only got stopped by the by this chap on a bicycle so I dropped that I dropped
[38:23.820 --> 38:28.340]  the joint in a bag because we're going across on a boat and I dropped it and I
[38:28.340 --> 38:33.820]  walked the bike and I make sure he gonna be run back and got it fucking placed up
[38:33.820 --> 38:38.580]  on the way up and off in the lake I think and then Indonesia I did Thailand
[38:38.580 --> 38:43.060]  for quite a while man Thailand's really lovely some really nice cannabis so it's
[38:43.100 --> 38:48.020]  all press man but I really liked it man it again with such a soothing like a
[38:48.020 --> 38:52.300]  relaxing high you know this stayed in the hammock everybody's house just just
[38:52.300 --> 38:58.300]  talking away there and then we did it when I went India on my skateboard so
[38:58.300 --> 39:03.220]  went all over India traveled from about six months in India man
[39:03.220 --> 39:12.820]  I'm just being crazy man I could go on for hours about a while it's a it's
[39:12.820 --> 39:16.780]  definitely interesting man and that's man up through the shower so showers is
[39:16.780 --> 39:22.980]  gonna be all of your hand you freshly hand rubbed all in the hand
[39:22.980 --> 39:30.020]  delicious that hand rub delicious man absolutely and delicious so you're just
[39:30.020 --> 39:34.300]  kind of like you go into your your mature plant you're just kind of like
[39:34.300 --> 39:40.500]  massaging the buds and getting the heads on your hands absolutely absolutely the
[39:40.500 --> 39:44.220]  fresh pros and just keep rolling on your hand into it it's a lot of work and a
[39:44.220 --> 39:47.820]  lot of dedication man to find there's some really nice you gotta open up into
[39:47.820 --> 39:53.580]  Malawi down the castle and then all over the mountains or on the castle managers
[39:53.580 --> 39:58.780]  ranges of cannabis man a lot of fields the police keep cutting it down
[39:58.780 --> 40:02.180]  eradication so they keep going higher for the mountains and this is beautiful
[40:02.180 --> 40:06.820]  man it's it's amazing and some of the chess
[40:06.820 --> 40:12.780]  the turpentine so wicked man so spicy man and just a real life beautiful it
[40:12.780 --> 40:20.700]  really is man it's a in the always as a man smoking smoking showers we we hiked
[40:20.700 --> 40:24.340]  above the above the clouds and the cinema of the clouds smoking showers and
[40:24.340 --> 40:28.540]  then the pipes for me it was quite a problem because I don't smoke tobacco
[40:28.540 --> 40:32.020]  everyone in India smokes a tobacco because it's shillings obviously so
[40:32.020 --> 40:37.380]  yeah a chillum is a circular pipe with a larger hole at the bottom cylinder and a
[40:37.380 --> 40:41.180]  smaller hole so you put a mesh over the smaller hole you fill the pipe with
[40:41.180 --> 40:51.900]  cannabis and tobacco cannabis of you myself and then you begin to inhale it
[40:51.900 --> 40:55.740]  was it's really nice for cannabis but there's not not so many people smoke
[40:55.900 --> 41:03.500]  cannabis purely in India unfortunately I was gonna say yeah you know a lot of the
[41:03.500 --> 41:08.580]  stories I've heard from some people is they almost like frown upon the flower
[41:08.580 --> 41:13.540]  like they're like you smoke the flower it's really all about you know the resin
[41:13.540 --> 41:19.260]  and the trichomes the hash everyone you asked for the US for this and flan this
[41:19.260 --> 41:26.860]  and that and then they're all in a way you know no and there's no so for me it
[41:26.860 --> 41:31.500]  was quite hard you know I was often using the the leaves and dry leaves
[41:31.500 --> 41:37.340]  grind down dry leaves as a substitute you know it's just so cool you know the
[41:37.340 --> 41:43.740]  challenge just just beautiful man so smooth but a really slamming body heavy
[41:43.740 --> 41:49.980]  high man like just a sit I remember in that up in the mountains is really nice
[41:49.980 --> 41:52.980]  you could just spend days I was on a skateboard as well you know we just go
[41:52.980 --> 41:55.700]  down skate the roads and you can see massive mountains with snow-capped
[41:55.700 --> 42:01.020]  mountains and just you could maybe in like half a mile you could find a hundred
[42:01.020 --> 42:05.340]  meters a nice road all that concrete you know that the thing was trying to find
[42:05.340 --> 42:13.220]  some Kong everything's all pretty you know pretty well rubbly and rough it's a
[42:13.220 --> 42:17.620]  good time I think India's great man if you guys are big into the hash and
[42:17.620 --> 42:21.620]  begin to seeing some local culture some really nice dolls are in those people
[42:21.620 --> 42:26.580]  seeing some awesome indica's just thriving everywhere you go man I remember
[42:26.580 --> 42:32.380]  I was sitting on the border and Nepal I said to me my buddy big Dave big Dave
[42:32.380 --> 42:40.700]  he's big it's called Dave so I say I'm big Dave at the pub before and I said
[42:40.700 --> 42:45.300]  now I'm gonna I'm gonna cross over I'm a skateboarding the end into Nepal and
[42:45.300 --> 42:49.140]  he said yeah sure I join yes all right sure but you're running man because I'm
[42:49.140 --> 42:53.260]  gonna skate Sam he said yeah sure right so I'll skate and he was running behind
[42:53.260 --> 42:59.340]  me I realized I had 10 grams of dry flour me and I said big Dave you don't
[42:59.340 --> 43:06.260]  mind it we're gonna have a little stop I've got us know these 10 grams and he
[43:06.260 --> 43:09.860]  said no that's fine Mike I said yeah great all right so we start we smoke
[43:09.860 --> 43:15.620]  fucking like 10 joints man but I did say a little bit hash for the for the
[43:15.620 --> 43:24.940]  next day and and you know and I saved it I saved a little bit of hash walk
[43:24.940 --> 43:29.660]  finally joints water for the the port customs there was cannabis plants 15
[43:29.660 --> 43:35.140]  feet high on either side of the border no one's looking a big day of thinking
[43:35.140 --> 43:40.900]  big day for all those joints many no I and I did some tricks for the for the
[43:40.900 --> 43:52.220]  guards a couple of bonuses I was in body a national park and then just an again
[43:52.220 --> 44:00.940]  on the bus into Nepal again everywhere everywhere beautiful you would was it
[44:00.940 --> 44:05.260]  like hemp was it just like headache weed or was this actual like I want a
[44:05.260 --> 44:13.740]  lot of headache we'd learn but it was cool man you know but if you go up into
[44:13.740 --> 44:19.180]  the mountains and obviously it's gonna be it's gonna be nice and not headache
[44:19.180 --> 44:24.060]  weed man some really beautiful man it's it's lovely man I think you're gonna
[44:24.060 --> 44:30.780]  enjoy many we'll have to go man you know those are regions where you know
[44:30.780 --> 44:36.460]  the the use and the production go back thousands of years so it's definitely a
[44:36.460 --> 44:42.260]  lot more entrenched and it's more of the cultural or maybe even spiritual
[44:42.260 --> 44:47.140]  connection of the area whereas you know it's it's a commodity in the US man
[44:47.140 --> 44:51.660]  there's a lot of people who are very very very disconnected from the plant
[44:51.660 --> 44:57.820]  but they're really freaking successful in the cannabis business so it'd be nice
[44:57.820 --> 45:03.460]  to go to a place where it's again more of the culture not the business it would
[45:03.460 --> 45:08.580]  be interesting to experience from that perspective did you see many different
[45:08.580 --> 45:12.580]  like techniques in the areas did everybody kind of have their secret
[45:12.580 --> 45:20.380]  little sauce or was it you know pretty uniform pretty uniform for the for the
[45:20.380 --> 45:24.300]  house making for the for the for the palm roll for the for the showers but it
[45:24.300 --> 45:28.820]  it's a quality right so it's a plant you have right so if you're you know
[45:28.820 --> 45:39.340]  here excuse me all those she does like us excuse me it's all good you know it's
[45:39.340 --> 45:42.580]  all about the quality of the flower though man but they they will they will
[45:42.580 --> 45:46.020]  they will run everything man it's definitely about and a technique is
[45:46.020 --> 45:49.900]  wedding I think the older it's a the order for the older generation really
[45:49.900 --> 45:54.540]  teach the younger generation how to make some great showers man it's it's
[45:54.540 --> 46:04.540]  that it's an art it's really an art man I couldn't it takes a long time to press
[46:04.540 --> 46:11.660]  a gram of chai rice it takes that take a very long time man like I think a few
[46:11.660 --> 46:17.540]  grams is gonna be one day work or so man like so it's it's really a quite a but
[46:17.540 --> 46:26.220]  that the product beautiful man now I guess I guess of all these places if
[46:26.220 --> 46:34.340]  we're talking like Canada you know Australia Southeast Asia Spain who had
[46:34.340 --> 46:44.470]  some of the better flower and why was it better flower oh who hun for me USA
[46:44.470 --> 46:49.390]  California and I and the West Coast has always got the best flower there that's
[46:49.390 --> 46:58.750]  a fair answer and hands down that yeah that's some grown them oh wow really
[46:58.750 --> 47:03.510]  really love that outside sun grown and working in the firework I was working in
[47:03.510 --> 47:09.630]  Reddingham for a for a season or two and absolutely amazing you know I'm ready
[47:09.630 --> 47:15.510]  I'm English we've got some really beautiful really beautiful cannabis and
[47:15.510 --> 47:23.070]  back home in England man but I think the curing process needs to be a refined man
[47:23.070 --> 47:28.870]  and as I Spain meant some beautiful some beautiful outside I was also in New
[47:28.870 --> 47:38.550]  Zealand for two years as well and that had some beautiful outside not so
[47:38.550 --> 47:42.670]  lovely man but you know it was really awesome and it was some nice outside it
[47:42.670 --> 47:47.110]  was growing on Maryland so the police didn't interfere when it was really nice
[47:47.110 --> 47:53.070]  a lot of outside weather in New Zealand is a dubious some rain us I think man
[47:53.070 --> 47:57.750]  it's gonna be USA dude like California did all the way and the West Coast do
[47:57.750 --> 48:06.790]  that you guys got the yeah it's yeah it's so true you know I didn't think
[48:06.790 --> 48:09.350]  about it till you said it and I'm like well yeah I guess that answer makes
[48:09.350 --> 48:13.910]  sense we're always uh I don't know if we take it for granted or we just it's just
[48:13.910 --> 48:18.430]  what it is but maybe grass is greener on the other side a lot of people here like
[48:18.430 --> 48:25.230]  pine for you know like a real indica short plant from you know Afghanistan or
[48:25.230 --> 48:30.950]  you know the hills of Nepal and we always romanticize I guess that's the
[48:30.950 --> 48:37.390]  word I was looking for but we really do got some great stuff here you guys got
[48:37.390 --> 48:40.630]  some really good straight you know every you know every we got yeah like you
[48:40.630 --> 48:43.910]  salmon that all I'm all they send you the Afghanis and hash plants are
[48:43.910 --> 48:47.950]  absolutely beautiful money we have to a short flower and absolutely men get it
[48:47.950 --> 48:52.150]  in when I think that that's amazing man but you know everything it's got their
[48:52.150 --> 48:56.470]  own you know you know and I think that's awesome you know like you guys got some
[48:56.470 --> 49:01.430]  awesome genetics you've got some amazing genetics no we need to everything
[49:01.430 --> 49:09.630]  needs to be I think more universal man yeah yeah you know the merging of the
[49:09.630 --> 49:13.350]  two and you know one thing that I've seen over the last I don't know maybe
[49:13.350 --> 49:20.270]  ten years or so but Spain has become a large producer probably again because
[49:20.270 --> 49:25.790]  you can do outdoor but they're doing a lot of seed production in Spain as well
[49:26.150 --> 49:32.550]  but they're not always getting like the you know the American genetics but some
[49:32.550 --> 49:37.790]  of them are making their way over there so what are you seeing in that corner of
[49:37.790 --> 49:41.590]  the world because again being over here like I want your white widow I want your
[49:41.590 --> 49:44.870]  hazes which are the stuff you guys are like I'm tired of the white widows I'm
[49:44.870 --> 49:51.270]  tired of the hazes that's what it is I had exactly I think hey you guys wouldn't
[49:51.270 --> 49:58.550]  have the classics and right now though you know we released in 2001 we do in
[49:58.550 --> 50:04.110]  white label we did a USA release you know you guys did a lot of 420s
[50:04.110 --> 50:07.790]  you know you got a banana double cush cakes we've got all these all these
[50:07.790 --> 50:11.670]  American influence trains which is awesome hey there it is absolutely man
[50:11.670 --> 50:15.350]  we did the American series which I think is fucking we got some
[50:15.350 --> 50:22.950]  beautiful beautiful stuff on there you know and you know because at the time
[50:22.950 --> 50:28.910]  you know like we you know we want because we're always researching man
[50:28.910 --> 50:31.630]  here at sensor we're always researching we always and there's always something
[50:31.630 --> 50:36.030]  breathing or something going on you know and in there in the facilities so we
[50:36.030 --> 50:39.590]  really want to do a USA same because at the moment and at the moment man I just
[50:39.590 --> 50:43.030]  see a lot of cookie strains everything's cookies everything's cookies or runs
[50:43.030 --> 50:49.350]  you see you know a critical runs a white runs you've got the cookies and I think
[50:49.350 --> 50:55.590]  those two genetics are just massively overpowering right here right here at
[50:55.590 --> 51:00.150]  the moment man you know there's been a bit of a lack of focus on the you know
[51:00.150 --> 51:04.870]  on the classic on the tangies you know and it's amazing the focus is now on you
[51:04.870 --> 51:14.150]  know the cookies and I'm you know I think massively mad man for that it's
[51:14.150 --> 51:20.550]  crazy man okay we get stronger than I love the Girl Scouts you know I think
[51:20.550 --> 51:27.390]  they're beautiful I like I like the actual Girl Scout cookies the food a
[51:27.390 --> 51:31.790]  heck of a lot better than I like the cannabis so I know you're not a big
[51:31.790 --> 51:38.750]  cookie man Chad yeah no no you should see I've got a couple pictures up on my
[51:38.750 --> 51:42.530]  Instagram because I did stop by the greenhouse which has the cookies
[51:42.530 --> 51:47.030]  crossover it's all remodeled down on the Green Mile I went in there and there
[51:47.030 --> 51:50.470]  there may or may not be a couple pictures of me standing next to burners
[51:50.470 --> 52:00.590]  picture so yeah but you know what I had I had to do it and it's it's funny cuz
[52:00.590 --> 52:05.590]  well you're from the UK I'm sure you know about a good pub crawl in the US
[52:05.590 --> 52:11.030]  you know we all the dispensaries and whatnot are always gathered close to
[52:11.030 --> 52:15.270]  each other because of zoning laws and where they can it can't be we don't have
[52:15.270 --> 52:20.270]  coffee shops so you can't actually consume there but the Green Mile in
[52:20.270 --> 52:23.750]  Amsterdam as soon as you basically you get off the train station Amsterdam
[52:23.750 --> 52:28.430]  Central you walk a couple blocks take a right and then boom you're you're you're
[52:28.430 --> 52:33.990]  doing the Green Mile and if you think you can like pub crawl that bitch no you
[52:33.990 --> 52:41.430]  can't but we did have to hit that cookie spot it's on the extortion now what did
[52:41.430 --> 52:49.270]  you what did it set you back Cheddar fucking the so yeah I posted a picture
[52:49.270 --> 52:56.510]  of their menu we got the $11 probably a white widow from there but yeah that was
[52:56.510 --> 53:04.630]  the $27 a gram gelato you know $28 run type place the Gary Payton's like
[53:04.630 --> 53:13.790]  fucking $50 a pinky no you know a pinky and like you're firstborn so we did it
[53:13.790 --> 53:18.190]  we didn't partake on that you know it's like I almost really wondered I'm not a
[53:18.190 --> 53:26.030]  baller like that but I really wonder how good a $28 gram is cuz there was
[53:26.190 --> 53:30.830]  so the best the best smoke that we actually found when we went around the
[53:30.830 --> 53:36.550]  country was in Den Helder there was a coffee shop in Den Helder
[53:36.550 --> 53:42.350]  representing the wicked and it was like I was like dude I would be really happy
[53:42.350 --> 53:45.710]  to say I grew this and we talked to you know the guy who was working there who
[53:45.710 --> 53:51.790]  happened to be the owner who may or may not been the grower but we got into some
[53:51.790 --> 53:56.350]  good conversation with the guy and yeah but back to my point though it's like
[53:56.350 --> 54:01.630]  even though like in rec stores here there's like a really good strain like
[54:01.630 --> 54:06.190]  let's just say runs for example run should be very distinctive I have tried
[54:06.190 --> 54:12.070]  five or ten different versions of runs from a rec store it just tastes like
[54:12.070 --> 54:17.710]  everything else to me so I kind of wonder if that $28 gram there is
[54:17.710 --> 54:21.670]  actually gonna be a good representation or if it's just gonna be a generic
[54:21.790 --> 54:25.910]  that's what it is I think I'm going with a second one
[54:25.910 --> 54:33.110]  Sheldon definitely it's gonna be I think that's what it is man people people pay
[54:33.110 --> 54:40.470]  it man like people people are what a shame what a shame that sums it up right
[54:40.470 --> 54:47.710]  there what a shame tell me a little bit maybe about the social clubs and you
[54:47.710 --> 54:52.310]  actually did a really good blog post for the Sensei seeds blog about social
[54:52.310 --> 54:56.270]  clubs in Spain that I've read and I've actually forwarded to a couple other
[54:56.270 --> 55:01.910]  people who are like I'm going or what is it like what should we kind of expect
[55:01.910 --> 55:05.670]  from some of the flower there now because I'm sure it's changed since the
[55:05.670 --> 55:11.030]  Rolex guy absolutely man you know that that was just one that was just one
[55:11.030 --> 55:14.790]  social club obviously you know there's that was outside of a that was on in
[55:14.790 --> 55:18.390]  Malaga so you know there's so many hundreds of social clubs all over Spain
[55:18.390 --> 55:23.310]  and absolutely brilliant man now that's why I went to Spain because we
[55:23.310 --> 55:26.830]  personally say there's the the new Amsterdam you know there's so much
[55:26.830 --> 55:31.270]  happening you know there's a massive awesome display of extracts man's
[55:31.270 --> 55:36.230]  radiant Rossin's man a lot of one of my favorites is a wee flowers which is in
[55:36.230 --> 55:40.510]  the in Barcelona and they and they have a nice Rossin press they do the masses
[55:40.510 --> 55:45.630]  of Rossin competitions if any of you guys know that some pressing
[55:45.630 --> 55:51.830]  competitions so concentrates are fully cool Spain concentrates yes Netherlands
[55:51.830 --> 55:56.630]  concentrates no no that you know and I think that's where I went on that's
[55:56.630 --> 56:03.270]  amazing you know after I think I think the scene here has been dead for a while
[56:03.270 --> 56:05.870]  we're not dead I think people trying to be invited but now everyone move to
[56:05.870 --> 56:11.710]  Spain many now let's go to Spain you know because why you know what we know
[56:11.710 --> 56:14.390]  in Netherlands when it's illegal to concentrate let's go to Spain when we
[56:14.390 --> 56:17.790]  can just blast oh you know we can do Rossin's we can do live resin let's do
[56:17.790 --> 56:23.170]  some sources you know we can get a get a delicious all these turps man you know
[56:23.170 --> 56:28.010]  we're gonna and I think that's and when we went over there you know we Spanner
[56:28.010 --> 56:34.070]  base is that one of the you know biggest festival exhibition should I say it's
[56:34.070 --> 56:38.110]  beautiful money now you got the cover shops and you have to the thing is you
[56:38.110 --> 56:43.950]  have to know people to be able to get into them that's what I'm going to work
[56:43.950 --> 56:48.910]  to some social clubs email them before don't show up outside saying hey you
[56:48.910 --> 56:54.990]  know it's it's still a bit of a gray area you know it's still that great you
[56:54.990 --> 57:00.110]  know it's they'll not recognize you know it's still going through a bit of a bit
[57:00.110 --> 57:02.990]  of a big out of the issue so you know it's best not to broadcast yourself if
[57:02.990 --> 57:06.750]  you want to go to look at that so happy to welcome me the guys are so awesome
[57:06.750 --> 57:11.670]  but just send them an email let them know you're coming and they're gonna
[57:11.670 --> 57:14.350]  welcome to your open arms and you're happy to try everything here you're
[57:14.350 --> 57:19.270]  there from the many but don't don't go up and say hey man you know I'm here in
[57:19.270 --> 57:27.230]  town I'm sending a message say hey guys you know I'm looking really want to do
[57:27.230 --> 57:32.030]  because it's a membership you know because you can't to be a sudden
[57:32.030 --> 57:37.870]  cannabis is illegal so by joining it's we're joining a club we're doing a
[57:37.870 --> 57:42.710]  social club we've put it then actually selling us we're giving them donations
[57:42.710 --> 57:50.990]  towards a club in return they are giving us some delicious concentrates and
[57:50.990 --> 57:57.590]  so the bag cost $20 but the weed in it is free exactly so you pay you pay a
[57:57.590 --> 58:05.110]  membership charge yep so it's actually you know you pay maybe 10 but 10 year
[58:05.110 --> 58:10.470]  and you're welcome to go in and like all social clubs you know you can buy a
[58:10.470 --> 58:17.630]  drink or exchange money for a purchase I know and all the social clubs which I
[58:17.630 --> 58:21.190]  think is called is a quite a few were growing their own inside you know I
[58:21.190 --> 58:23.750]  think that's more growing their own and supplying their own nothing that was
[58:23.750 --> 58:32.590]  that's the dream man I'd love to grow it like you know grow it on the top
[58:32.590 --> 58:36.990]  floor process it on the middle floor sell it on the bottom go down the bottom
[58:36.990 --> 58:42.790]  floor that is exactly what it's all about man that's where it needs to be
[58:42.790 --> 58:54.950]  you know the legalization of cannabis in Thailand is a wow what a what a
[58:54.950 --> 59:02.150]  change you know big I know a couple people over there right now a couple
[59:02.150 --> 59:07.430]  people who have been there and then one person in particular who went over there
[59:07.430 --> 59:13.510]  there's a breeder Steve is a fairly large player in cannabis industry for
[59:13.510 --> 59:20.750]  for many years decades I guess I should say but he's been in Thailand doing you
[59:20.750 --> 59:27.830]  know like a million seed hunts with you know full permission and all that but
[59:27.830 --> 59:33.990]  anyways he said another person that we know over there and it's fun to see his
[59:33.990 --> 59:39.510]  guys names potent ponics Steve but yeah he just landed and he's you know he's
[59:39.510 --> 59:44.710]  testing new strains they're building out the buildings or creating their you know
[59:44.710 --> 59:52.680]  IMOs and doing all this stuff in Thailand so Thailand's gonna blow up
[59:52.680 --> 59:58.560]  absolutely Simon I think it's gonna blow up dude now how far one thing that I
[59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.200]  love about the Netherlands is dude you're like two hours from everywhere in
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.960]  the fucking world which blows my mind because it takes me 14 hours to get
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:12.120]  there how close is Thailand like is that just like a day trip or you know you're
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:20.320]  like a let's get you to our flight oh we're talking about my own flight okay
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.920]  so it's not it's not like I'm gonna hop on a train to go to Paris today that's
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.920]  only two hours from Amsterdam fuckers yeah you can you can head to a
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:33.320]  Thailand's quite a while ago we're actually looking into
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:37.640]  heading over to Thailand you know that's definitely where to go right now with
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:44.960]  the way the industry is yeah we got some I know some people over there and I know
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:49.040]  you know again this is kind of that like is it a curse or a blessing but I know a
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:54.640]  lot of American genetics that have found their way with people over there recently
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.160]  and it's great that's what the locals crave yet we're the ones who want give
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:05.040]  us that Thai stick that's correct that's crazy because that you know the time
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.480]  they want to keep it you know they want to keep all the netting so I keep keeping
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:14.760]  in Thailand right so all these American sneaking into the country
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:20.960]  we're gonna be insane dude I mean it's already it's the same it's you know they
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:25.000]  want Cali strains I actually saw something the other day that was listed
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.520]  as you know Oklahoma weed I'm like since they have never been to the state
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.600]  well home is not the place to be bragging about but from the outside
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.840]  perspective you mentioned a lot of growers you know in the Netherlands had
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:43.040]  gone to Spain because it was just much easier and more conducive to grow so many
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:47.520]  people have left California a lot of the very good talented growers with great
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.600]  genetics and they went to Oklahoma because it's legally much easier it's
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:57.000]  cheaper didn't have a much cheaper cultivation license and you're at all
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.880]  easy to sell to the market I know yeah yeah I mean again California is highly
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:09.760]  restrictive Oklahoma was like hey dude give us $2,000 you got an unlimited plant
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:16.680]  count make sure you build a fence though would you so yeah that's that's just
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:20.560]  frickin go if it wasn't Oklahoma I probably would have moved there and done
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:27.240]  the same thing but not a big Oklahoma fan there that's like straight up middle
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:31.040]  of the country nothing against the middle of the country I just like my
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:38.960]  water so the ocean so redneck some eggs cool man I'm sure I'm sure there's a few
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:45.480]  cowboys in Oklahoma which is kind of crazy that they're all for cannabis but
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:50.960]  at the same time it's more of not a we like cannabis thing it's like we don't
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:58.440]  like government telling us what to do thing what do you know what's that what
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:04.080]  do you know so it's a massive token no yes yes Willie Nelson he's got his own
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:09.320]  brand of cannabis in the same thing again because it's because it's federally
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:15.320]  illegal you can't cross state borders with anything and so businesses like
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:20.760]  Willie Nelson's is Willie's Reserve is his brand each state that he's active in
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:27.920]  he has to select a grower in that state to grow it which breeds inconsistencies
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:33.840]  and there's a whole white labeling issue but you know put a famous name on a pack
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:47.730]  in it will sell a celebrity strains as they say very dubious man yeah who's
[01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:52.130]  who's who's gonna be like I can't say I've heard of like the the Netherlands
[01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:57.130]  they're the Dutch straight actually Neville's Hayes there we go
[01:03:57.130 --> 01:04:06.890]  Neville's Hayes that's a while ago oh yeah that's that's a while ago no
[01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:13.290]  nothing yeah nothing recently so we've got some classics sensei seeds is
[01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:19.690]  absolutely known for producing a lot of these classics has has there been
[01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:24.530]  anything you know just over the years or do you remember like your first like
[01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:29.050]  sensei strain or did you have a favorite or a couple of the classics
[01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:34.690]  that you enjoyed or still enjoy man I always enjoy the jack dude I always
[01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:39.650]  injured but for me it's a skunk number one man but that that she's right man
[01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:45.690]  that old school the old school cheese man for me it was beast in the 90s and
[01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:56.250]  when the 2000s it was be strange yep cheese in England was when memory you
[01:04:56.250 --> 01:05:00.570]  need to add some cheese when you open the bag and I just have this tape it to
[01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:04.650]  the bottom of my the wheel arch my car because it's stung that I couldn't even
[01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:09.890]  put it in a bag in my car wrapped in the bag because it's stunk that much that
[01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:17.050]  was the skunk number one man though the the pure man they the older the old the
[01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:21.170]  the flying Dutchman the pure the original skunk number one but that's

[01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:20.410]  dude that fucking oh my I know one time I was at my buddy's uni there was a
[01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:28.330]  four-story building and I was trying to be on the sling and I was just in
[01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:32.770]  my buddy's apartment rolling him up and it was a reed dude and the guy knocked on
[01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:38.850]  the door hey buddy what you for sale I said nothing man so I went outside to

[01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:49.890]  smoking this stuff outside man just absolutely reeked man you could smell it
[01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:54.690]  all the way up to the top floor this fucking this student residency shortly
[01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:58.570]  after the security came so I made a quick getaway it's my doubts like uh
[01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:03.450]  smoking just outside man money it's dunk planet with some of the best cheese I've
[01:07:03.450 --> 01:07:09.210]  ever had man but not what I have difficulty finding that same man in
[01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:15.290]  England it's a star dogs and there's no cheese man I have a hard-eyed look man
[01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:22.930]  but don't worry no yeah it's like a lot of us I'm just texting my phone here
[01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:27.210]  cuz Jenna you know Jen definitely wants to say hi to Kim at some point well
[01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:35.770]  we'll get that in here yeah yes I know Jen would love that too and everybody
[01:07:35.770 --> 01:07:41.970]  just tuning in we're friends this is my homie from the Netherlands so I'm a
[01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:49.370]  stoked he's he was a very awesome host to us as well while we were there
[01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:57.370]  guys yeah but yeah you know we can't we can't find that RKS or the roadkill
[01:07:57.370 --> 01:08:01.410]  skunk anymore a lot so there's a couple different stories actually a lot of
[01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:05.770]  people will contend that well you know it smelled so bad and actually let me
[01:08:05.770 --> 01:08:09.810]  just preface this because people get their panties in a bunch about roadkill
[01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:14.210]  skunk I'm gonna say it is probably still out there somewhere someone in the hills
[01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:17.850]  of California probably has it they just don't give a fuck about the internet or
[01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:23.370]  you so they're not giving it out but it's still around but anyways nobody can
[01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:29.850]  find it nobody has it and to you know to the popular kind of you know reasons for
[01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:33.050]  that is one is like okay well people you know they kept getting busted nobody
[01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:36.610]  wanted that smell there's no carbon filter on this earth that can mask that
[01:08:36.610 --> 01:08:41.410]  odor so they just selectively bred away from it you know they didn't select that
[01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:46.850]  one anymore and then there's also the story of skunk man Sam you know skunk man
[01:08:46.850 --> 01:08:51.410]  Sam and skunk number one and he took it in a different direction going more for
[01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:57.810]  the fruity and so there's that like delineation there there's you know
[01:08:57.810 --> 01:09:02.850]  there's a skunk number one that's exactly like you were describing and I
[01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:06.450]  grabbed some of those white label ones and grew it out and I definitely had
[01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:10.370]  like a tennis ball smell there's nothing absolutely fruity about it but then
[01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:18.010]  there's also the number one which has that fruity profile absolutely absolutely
[01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:23.890]  man I think it's that you know the fee knows but for me it's all about that
[01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:31.450]  that knockout cheese man that yeah that's what I'm looking for now do you
[01:09:31.450 --> 01:09:39.350]  you know you you're like me you know we smoke all day throughout the day after
[01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:44.990]  when after hanging out Jen is like I think we smoked like 10 grams today and
[01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:59.030]  three grams of hash but do you typically go you know do you have like oh I like
[01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:03.170]  you know like indica leaners or do you have certain strains that you like
[01:10:03.170 --> 01:10:07.630]  during the evening and then certain ones during the day for me Jack Jack is like
[01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:14.230]  my morning the limonene lemon terpenes those are kind of like refreshing and
[01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:18.670]  uplifting for me so that's usually what I go to in the morning what it what is
[01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:26.590]  your daily cannabis digestion like I like I'm more in Nicodemus man I love
[01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:31.870]  the earthy mercy the fucking looks nice I did I'm a heavy hitter with the
[01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:36.790]  indica's man start the day dude it depends right now I've got Jack so you
[01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:39.670]  know I'll sell it with Jack but other days it's definitely getting more of an
[01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:46.350]  Afghan something so we can not have your man in the dominant man absolutely yeah
[01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:51.390]  and then but everything's got a little bit of hash and of course you know I
[01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:57.990]  usually we do it you gotta be a grandma grandma cannabis dry flower with a
[01:10:57.990 --> 01:11:03.350]  number about a quarter gram of hash that'll start the day off a reckon and
[01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:10.670]  then we'll do about six of those five of those depending on the day time it's
[01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:19.510]  definitely gonna be more something heavy man like a good regular absolutely man
[01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:29.390]  sorry dude oh no no worries I'm sorry there's a little bit of a delay so I'm

[01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:56.950]  hash it was fun I was talking with Mila Jansen what hash Queen Amsterdam local
[01:12:56.950 --> 01:13:03.190]  as well she she you know we all I made a joke about shoe hash and which is
[01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:07.030]  actually kind of what I do to press it she's like oh the skiers from the I
[01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:09.910]  think it was like the out she's like they would always put it in their ski
[01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:17.030]  boot for the day and I was like next time I'm going snowboarding I'm gonna
[01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:24.110]  make that man yeah cuz you're like it's so hot it's so much pressure like you
[01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:27.670]  got a good product by the end of the day
[01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:39.030]  absolutely perfect right yep that'll be fun but yeah so she was a fun interview
[01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:44.470]  she told me some cool stories you know just about Amsterdam and one of the
[01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:51.190]  the grows that she had there was a old like war bomb bunker for during the
[01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:55.990]  World War two that was like under a bridge in Amsterdam and still had all
[01:13:55.990 --> 01:14:03.070]  the power connected she was growing in it I'm like what the hell sick dude yeah
[01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:10.270]  what what is it you know what is it like now kind of down in the city cuz you
[01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:14.390]  well the majority of the sensei seeds actually has a lot of buildings and I
[01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:17.510]  want to talk about that maybe here in a second to just the different things you
[01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:22.870]  have going but predominantly they're focused in the red light district or
[01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:27.030]  kind of like the tourist area so what for somebody who's never been there or
[01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:32.270]  maybe it's been 10 years what what is that area kind of like today the red
[01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:38.470]  light district yeah well it's not as vibrant as it used to be they are trying
[01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:42.790]  to work closed on some of the the red light district is based over a few
[01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:47.070]  canals just this was really close to the central train station there was all
[01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:53.390]  the round the canals are based all around the city the red light district
[01:14:53.390 --> 01:15:01.390]  is slowly as you said with the before about the the the plan to limit tourists
[01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:06.110]  to the end of the capital coffee shops they also try to plan to eliminate the
[01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:10.190]  the red light district traffic so a lot of these windows are getting boarding up
[01:15:10.190 --> 01:15:15.310]  making up the independent shops especially for clothing record stores
[01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:22.030]  and it's really dying the tourism still there but it's everything's dying and
[01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:27.630]  you know there's not as many traffic so we stopped shipping the seeds to Germany
[01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:31.790]  by the year and a half ago you know so that a lot of traffic we get in the
[01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:36.590]  senses obviously for the German customers but other than that you know
[01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:39.830]  the red light district is it's still going right now we're coming out the
[01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:43.750]  Christmas so they just put the lights up it's always a really tough it's
[01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:47.710]  really nice at Christmas it's really awesome but you know it's not the same
[01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:52.590]  as a few years ago I think after COVID it really you know like every way
[01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:55.790]  really took its toll on on everywhere and I think that you can definitely see
[01:15:55.790 --> 01:16:01.870]  that now you know it's it's not it's busy but it's not as busy it used to be
[01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:07.390]  you know it's not really the it's not really the same you know you know
[01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:12.670]  everything should super early now you know if you look at the clock to be
[01:16:12.670 --> 01:16:18.990]  honest but the the passion for the cannabis is still there and there's
[01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:21.950]  certainly a few years to come to sense and that's awesome you know there's
[01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:25.150]  still people who are that's awesome especially the guys who are going
[01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:30.670]  regulars that's awesome and that's what we're we love to see people growing
[01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:36.150]  regular seeds man like makes us stay when people are
[01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:43.790]  man come in man gotcha yeah you know European market I see a lot of fans a
[01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:47.510]  lot of auto flowers I've always been a regular person because that's what I
[01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:55.870]  mean yeah and I mean it well in those climates you can just kind of throw them
[01:16:55.870 --> 01:17:01.390]  outside and let them do their thing it's it's maybe a less personal connection to
[01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:04.710]  the cultivation aspect but you know again that's another thing I love about
[01:17:04.710 --> 01:17:12.390]  working with regulars you got to be eyes in the garden absolutely man the
[01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:16.950]  eyes and ears do you know I do appreciate automatics of all of the
[01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:20.470]  they're really great for menstrual patients you know does the time to do
[01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:24.110]  anything with lighting you know the time that I think that's also we know you
[01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:27.910]  know that that's great but for other enthusiasts like I mean he's suffering
[01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:32.910]  I think regulars you know I think that's also many know the eyes do the eyes and
[01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:38.670]  the ears Chad yes see what's going on you know I think that's amazing you know
[01:17:38.670 --> 01:17:41.470]  and I think it's awesome to watch you progress you know and they in the
[01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:44.910]  growing process and I think you know at the end of the day you know you know to
[01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:51.870]  watch you know to germinate this this great this great thing you got a packet
[01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:56.030]  from a seed bank and then to watch the process man it's just beautiful man I
[01:17:56.030 --> 01:18:00.830]  think that's awesome and you know sit down smoking the reaping the work Chad
[01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:08.110]  is a beautiful writer yeah you know the phenomenon again you know it's cloning
[01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:12.510]  dude oh wow it just goes on doesn't it but there's a never-ending amount of
[01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:19.590]  happiness do that it's true and and you you know you get to be actually kind of
[01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:28.150]  the eyes and ears for sensei seeds in many ways you've visited many grows
[01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:35.590]  you've seen many test grows of these plants yes is that something that you
[01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:43.350]  know you're able to talk about or as such what do you know yeah for the a lot
[01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:48.070]  of the new strains are we we've got a lot in our facility and yeah I go down
[01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:52.430]  and make sure you know I think it's unified you know we are I do have a
[01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:55.670]  final say in there and there are Lisa the strains for sure man you know if it
[01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:59.310]  you know because we had a few strains that you know that we were going to
[01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:02.750]  release and you know after doing it you know it went down to the grow reports
[01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:06.310]  you know this one at the center standards you know you know it's gotta
[01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:12.230]  be you know and right now we were we're just about you know and I think it's
[01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:16.430]  important man that you know I you know you go down and you know everyone down
[01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:20.510]  to the facility's his hands on you know as well as the guys over here and I
[01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:23.910]  think it's important man them you know we do the best you know the best we can
[01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:29.550]  you know I think it's got to be stable money no and I saw this one yeah that's
[01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:32.710]  that's really good to hear you know again that there are you know standards
[01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:38.190]  being applied because since he sees how you set a high standard for yourself so
[01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:45.150]  you know you guys definitely have a reputation that you're continuing oh I
[01:19:45.150 --> 01:19:49.790]  I'm sorry I see I see something about a dad joke in here I get sidetracked by
[01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:55.070]  dad jokes so I'm gonna I'm gonna totally just throw in another dad joke here
[01:19:55.070 --> 01:20:03.550]  because I promised him okay you gotta go well what do Alexander the Great and
[01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:15.050]  Winnie the Pooh have in common their middle name boom okay
[01:20:15.050 --> 01:20:24.770]  and I am terrible dad jokes are supposed to be terrible oh man oh terrible okay

[01:20:55.570 --> 01:20:59.890]  yes it is it is so you guys probably thought I was gonna say something else
[01:20:59.890 --> 01:21:07.810]  didn't ya oh dad joke on ya what okay back to the actual programming here I
[01:21:07.930 --> 01:21:11.930]  know it's good to see you know the standards and it's good to see some
[01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:17.970]  things come up and you know one of the places where I was able to see plants
[01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:24.770]  was the hash and hemp museum and that was pretty cool you guys have a few a
[01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:30.090]  few plants there out on the main floor that are part of all of the displays I
[01:21:30.090 --> 01:21:33.310]  thought it was really cool because I'm like hey that's one of the current
[01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:39.350]  sensei strains going on can you can you maybe tell people a little bit about you
[01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:43.790]  know the hash and hemp museum cuz that's if you're ever in Amsterdam sorry I'm
[01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:49.790]  trying to plug in my battery here that is well worth the time absolutely guys
[01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:54.190]  if you're ever now I'm coming to see we we have an exhibition of cannabis
[01:21:54.190 --> 01:21:59.310]  related artifacts past present and future and we also have five plants
[01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:03.030]  growing which is great so you guys can see the cultivation process we have
[01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:09.230]  so many artifacts Ben's collection over a 10,000 artifacts and there we have two
[01:22:09.230 --> 01:22:13.270]  parts so we have one which is based on the the prohibition cannabis and we also
[01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:17.270]  have the plants inside we also have a museum based specifically on the
[01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:22.710]  industrial side of him which is awesome man we are if you're really into that
[01:22:22.710 --> 01:22:27.390]  check out hemp flax as well which is a obviously the Ben drunkers is a side
[01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:32.750]  project for the hemp industry absolutely brilliant you know watching
[01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:36.510]  them you know BMW for the insides of the cars for the Tesla's I have the other
[01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:44.630]  hemp interior hemp surfboards and for me then that really stood out the whole
[01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:50.790]  building interior is made hemp hemp crease I missed that part so that if you
[01:22:51.630 --> 01:22:59.110]  absolutely amazing man it's really it's a really great at the moment is that an
[01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:05.590]  exhibition about cannabis and tattoos so a lot of local artists who do a lot of
[01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:11.590]  free base art really beautiful before we had a CBD exhibition there's always
[01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:14.230]  something new pop on about every few months so it's really great to go down
[01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:18.710]  check it out it's a place to be men you also the
[01:23:18.710 --> 01:23:22.190]  center see the corner store which has been there for 120 and more than 20 years
[01:23:22.190 --> 01:23:27.830]  before the coffee shop people still sends the grazing ethics man we have
[01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:32.990]  some awesome awesome stuff you know check us on man yeah and I think I even
[01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:38.270]  saw like vice magazine had an office on the same street I think I saw like a
[01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:42.270]  little vice logo on one of the doors and I'm like huh I wonder if that's their
[01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:47.750]  that's their office but yeah this was so that the corner shop and the museum they
[01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:51.830]  were kind of in the red light district and this was different from where you
[01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:56.390]  know the first time we met was the sensei store on that what I call the
[01:23:56.390 --> 01:24:06.750]  Green Mile on what new and Ike yes new and Ike Street so so yeah so there are
[01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:12.150]  many stores but that's you know that was the picture in my head is when we went
[01:24:12.150 --> 01:24:17.070]  down there because the first day we were there we went to Oda Kirk which is
[01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:24.110]  700 800 year old church close to a thousand year old church right down
[01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:28.830]  there which is a little interesting because as you walk out of this church
[01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:37.310]  red light windows really weird no yeah really weird but we went there the first
[01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:43.670]  day because we had to go back but they were doing a special sunrise concert in
[01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:50.150]  this just yeah enormous gigantic church and like for me and Jen we were so
[01:24:50.150 --> 01:24:53.150]  blown away by that building the first time we were there we're like we have to
[01:24:53.150 --> 01:24:56.670]  go back but they did the sunlight thing and we were up because of the time
[01:24:56.670 --> 01:25:03.070]  difference so we were walking around that area at 6 in the morning nobody
[01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:08.350]  did you see the full of trash or the trash on it yes everybody was stacking
[01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:18.070]  yeah everybody was stacking the streets it's trash covered in cans and piss
[01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:23.350]  between 6 o'clock and 8 o'clock is the the prime time to watch the no one there
[01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:29.030]  just trash piled up it's awesome and then if you look you many get the herons
[01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:34.510]  or the seagulls you know it looks on the garbage yeah yeah we saw some
[01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:38.070]  interesting birds it's just interesting to be over there and to see how things
[01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:43.750]  are done you know people you cannot understand a Amsterdam staircase if
[01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:48.670]  you've never walked up an Amsterdam staircase so seeing how people move
[01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:52.110]  things like you can't fit a couch or a bed or anything up there so when people
[01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:55.950]  are moving you literally see people like doing everything through the outside
[01:25:55.950 --> 01:26:00.710]  windows with cranes and stuff like I've got little like movers they like put
[01:26:00.710 --> 01:26:05.830]  them on and it just their couch is going up to the window it's fucking crazy it's
[01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:11.510]  for the first time I was like man that's awesome because I remember in Canada trying to get
[01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:16.630]  this sofa down from the second floor it was just hell man and I watched people going
[01:26:16.630 --> 01:26:24.290]  what a genius idea man yeah what a genius idea dude brilliant man everything
[01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:29.310]  gets to the top window you know if you're in the top floor it goes in
[01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:37.870]  there's it goes in there Dutch or did it dude fucking crafty that's what I'll
[01:26:37.870 --> 01:26:49.590]  say it's crafty and precise precise yeah yeah interesting way to describe it I
[01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:52.790]  hope we're not talking about the trains with the trains here a fucking terrible
[01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:59.270]  man well yeah ever since ever since we left the NS has seemingly been on strike
[01:26:59.790 --> 01:27:05.110]  and then Shipol still can't get it shit together so we we left at the right time
[01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:08.870]  before the country kind of struck and you mentioned it before you know Kobe
[01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:13.510]  kind of took a chunk out of everything yeah we absolutely noticed that you know
[01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:17.190]  this time we were there right before the world closed and then we were there
[01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:24.750]  again in May this year and yeah it's it's a bit different the world uh let's

[01:33:10.710 --> 01:33:14.630]  also went out so this the Nakatomi Plaza's been getting tested all year
[01:33:14.630 --> 01:33:20.150]  which was really cool because a lot of people grew this outside I don't grow
[01:33:20.150 --> 01:33:27.790]  good really good everybody enjoyed it no complaints nothing weird so yeah I was
[01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:30.910]  stoked to see it grown outside too because again where I'm at just that
[01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:38.670]  not possible so yeah yeah whether shit but beautiful man yeah it's right shit
[01:33:38.670 --> 01:33:43.430]  but beautiful at the same time it's hard but it's true so yeah that's coming out
[01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:46.790]  and then the Hans Gruber was coming out too but I gave that out to testers as
[01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:50.750]  well one of the people yeah one of the people got a hold me he's like how many
[01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:56.390]  you got left how much you want for it so I'm like okay just so sold those off
[01:33:56.390 --> 01:34:00.890]  already found something that he really liked wanted to hunt some more so who
[01:34:00.890 --> 01:34:06.890]  knows there there may be some crosses of that somewhere in the future but so
[01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:10.650]  yeah it's just the Nakatomi Plaza now but definitely dropping in December man
[01:34:10.650 --> 01:34:16.770]  that's that's the appropriate time to drop a diehard release yes I'm a man we

[01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:54.130]  play and depends on how long you are how much how much you want to take with you
[01:34:54.130 --> 01:35:00.850]  I do have do you have a couple questions here from chat already and
[01:35:00.850 --> 01:35:05.050]  we're you know kind of talking about growing or grow styles earth boxes are
[01:35:05.050 --> 01:35:08.810]  something that's been really popular over here and that's kind of just like a
[01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:14.250]  bottom feeding system it's you'll have your medium in there you kind of have
[01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:19.930]  like a airspace under and you're and you're filling it you know the tube with
[01:35:19.930 --> 01:35:24.570]  water and that's how it wakes up what seems to be the common way or how how do
[01:35:24.570 --> 01:35:30.490]  most people grow is it still all HPS or cocoa or what's what's common over there
[01:35:30.490 --> 01:35:38.370]  that depends on you know we usually do a medium mix so I'm personally I'm a cocoa
[01:35:38.370 --> 01:35:44.090]  man I like me I like me cocoa but a lot of people in medium mix there's no
[01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:48.570]  there's not so um earth boxes no not yet man you know we're said I was so pretty
[01:35:48.570 --> 01:35:54.170]  old-school man everyone loves the HBS is man you know like if you're an old
[01:35:54.170 --> 01:35:58.250]  school grower man you know it's all about HBS and myself I like me any of
[01:35:58.250 --> 01:36:03.010]  these men I'm especially on the power on the power aspect as well man like being
[01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:06.490]  a you know like living in the Netherlands it's especially with the
[01:36:06.490 --> 01:36:12.650]  power it's going up man I love me any of these but we we do a lot like we do HBS
[01:36:12.650 --> 01:36:18.130]  whether with a gross that's all that's all HBS man with a with a great boss
[01:36:18.130 --> 01:36:24.770]  that's all HBS we think but if I had the space I probably do HBS you know but
[01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:29.050]  um yeah I think it's all personal you know I think it's all a personal thing
[01:36:29.050 --> 01:36:35.490]  man but no earth boxes unfortunately you know um but and not a lot of Hydra either
[01:36:35.490 --> 01:36:39.090]  I mean I would have expected there's more Hydra to be honest but no and to be
[01:36:39.090 --> 01:36:43.650]  honest like the Dutch is super old-school dude like I don't really see
[01:36:43.650 --> 01:36:50.010]  any there are obviously a few people who you know but I find just right up dude
[01:36:50.010 --> 01:36:57.770]  like medium and medium in the pot on the HBS dude it's order feeders for sure
[01:36:57.770 --> 01:37:03.450]  but nothing can airboxes unfortunately not yet yeah yeah well yeah you know
[01:37:03.450 --> 01:37:08.450]  times times do you change times come around and LEDs really took hold here
[01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:12.690]  when they became more affordable they were around for a long time but then the
[01:37:12.690 --> 01:37:19.610]  efficiency caught up with HBS and then the price is still more than HBS by far
[01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:26.050]  but it's become more reasonable for people to do at home or even on scale
[01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:30.370]  because when you do it on scale and commercial grows if you do it right and
[01:37:30.370 --> 01:37:36.450]  you're in the good state you get energy rebates which oftentimes pays almost for
[01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:43.810]  most of your lights that's the way that's awesome and that's why they go
[01:37:43.810 --> 01:37:49.970]  man yeah and HBS you know again winter time right now I know a lot of UK guys
[01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:55.410]  that they swear by him because you're not running your heater as well
[01:37:55.410 --> 01:38:00.370]  man yeah yeah as long as not going to the roof guys when it snows you're good
[01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:08.650]  yeah don't don't be that melted snow which happens every year and we still
[01:38:08.650 --> 01:38:13.330]  laugh every year and we know about it but I'll be completely honest every time
[01:38:13.330 --> 01:38:25.690]  it snows I'm always out okay I'm good I'm good well I guess kind of one thing
[01:38:25.690 --> 01:38:31.530]  to just catching up you know maybe on technology or just different techniques
[01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:39.010]  is you guys also have the Cannabis College over in Amsterdam and there was
[01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:45.250]  a pretty interesting group of people when I visited there as well as a there
[01:38:45.250 --> 01:38:49.530]  was a delegation there and I thought it was cool to see people coming to learn
[01:38:49.530 --> 01:38:57.330]  about just the plant what what is the curriculum kind of based on over at the
[01:38:57.330 --> 01:39:02.490]  Cannabis College there well at the moment we're trying we are trying to get
[01:39:02.490 --> 01:39:07.090]  grow classes every Thursday at 420 of course nice we are trying to get people
[01:39:07.090 --> 01:39:10.650]  and over you know so we do a
[01:39:13.690 --> 01:39:18.130]  and then it's better than a structure man so we are we oh we're in that we do
[01:39:18.130 --> 01:39:22.610]  an internet growing course medicinal course you shoes we do a whole a whole
[01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:27.130]  range of course introduction of cannabis we try to which one to take take
[01:39:27.130 --> 01:39:31.050]  everyone you know it depends on that on the person a lot of people come in from
[01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:33.850]  Germany and they have no idea about cannabis so you know it's about sitting
[01:39:33.850 --> 01:39:37.290]  them down and about educating the people right about telling them what it is so
[01:39:37.290 --> 01:39:41.530]  you can sit down we have a nice awesome library all of all a great cannabis
[01:39:41.530 --> 01:39:45.130]  literature you can sit down so you know people are going that's what I ask some
[01:39:45.130 --> 01:39:48.930]  questions you know it's not about the specific syllabus you know it's about
[01:39:48.930 --> 01:39:53.810]  cannabis colleges about educating everyone about cannabis you know on 420
[01:39:53.810 --> 01:39:57.650]  we do we do have growing classes with the cultivation you know what about
[01:39:57.650 --> 01:40:01.290]  techniques you know whatever you want to do what is my educated but it's about
[01:40:01.290 --> 01:40:04.770]  personal questions you know it's about the one-on-one it's about so if you any
[01:40:04.770 --> 01:40:09.170]  questions you know something going wrong you know something you have problem with
[01:40:09.170 --> 01:40:15.010]  a growing you know my plants so and so you know sit down and it's about
[01:40:15.010 --> 01:40:19.770]  people educating people on CBD but not just it's you know but the whole aspect
[01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:23.650]  of cannabis man it's about some especially a lot of people come in and
[01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:27.570]  you know say yeah don't really understand anything you know so the
[01:40:27.570 --> 01:40:31.930]  courses is specifically for people you know you can go on the cannabis college
[01:40:31.930 --> 01:40:35.410]  online you can book some courses depending on you know what you're into
[01:40:35.410 --> 01:40:41.650]  you know if you're into the middle aspect if in a cultivation you know the
[01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:44.810]  cannabis got is that educate you men downstairs we have a nice garden we have
[01:40:44.810 --> 01:40:48.650]  five plants all times different growing stages we have some homies we haven't
[01:40:48.650 --> 01:40:52.810]  you know which one of the breeding programs well downstairs as a feminized
[01:40:52.810 --> 01:40:57.410]  I think there's been water flowers yeah we which right now we're trying to
[01:40:57.410 --> 01:41:00.890]  everyone you know what it's all about you know sometimes another big but
[01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:04.010]  that's what it's about you know it's about the experiments about testing and
[01:41:04.010 --> 01:41:09.410]  the cannabis colleges I am an educational I think when we try man
[01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:18.850]  isn't don't pay anything man just come I might ramble on a little bit man I
[01:41:18.850 --> 01:41:25.490]  think it's really cool that you approach it in a one-on-one aspect or you know
[01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:30.850]  instead of just teaching to the walls you're able okay what you know how much
[01:41:30.850 --> 01:41:35.090]  do you know where should I begin have you had any problems do you even know
[01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:44.370]  what to do what you know picture to two two really awesome guys they're down in
[01:41:44.370 --> 01:41:50.330]  the basement taking a look at a couple of the the plants there you know that's
[01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:54.130]  what it's about Chad money knows about you know because you you can do
[01:41:54.130 --> 01:41:58.850]  cultivation class you can do growing classes or whatever you know you can do
[01:41:58.850 --> 01:42:04.250]  but then people still my questions you know so personally I think it's best in
[01:42:04.250 --> 01:42:07.170]  and they're going one-on-one and say you know you know what's what's a problem
[01:42:07.170 --> 01:42:11.050]  you know when I was working in Canada for example in the medicinal dispensers
[01:42:11.050 --> 01:42:15.970]  people coming in now that's they say you know you know formaldehyde in and on
[01:42:15.970 --> 01:42:20.050]  the back pain man and people with with cancer man and we'd sit down man and
[01:42:20.050 --> 01:42:24.170]  we'd you know we'd sit down and we know for at least half an hour we talk man
[01:42:24.170 --> 01:42:28.690]  discuss you know and we'd see what you know what what works you know like oh we
[01:42:28.690 --> 01:42:32.530]  know what because that's what cannabis is about me it's not about I smoke this
[01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:36.650]  man no man but it's like what what are you what are you looking for like what
[01:42:36.650 --> 01:42:40.610]  do you what do you want from the plant not like what you where do you want to
[01:42:40.610 --> 01:42:45.810]  you know and I think I think the one-on-one is what it's all about man I
[01:42:45.810 --> 01:42:50.210]  think it's better growing as well you know like you know like what are you
[01:42:50.210 --> 01:42:55.330]  looking for you know like because I want to grow some wheat no but I mean you
[01:42:55.330 --> 01:42:59.690]  know what what you want to grow you know I can I was something you know and I
[01:42:59.690 --> 01:43:07.330]  think it's all I think education to be taught as a whole is awesome man but
[01:43:07.330 --> 01:43:11.570]  then specifically you know if you really want to learn I think it's one-on-one
[01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:15.850]  is awesome although I educate the whole world if I could man I'd sit down with
[01:43:15.850 --> 01:43:22.170]  everyone you know and and try and try and tell them for me man everyone's
[01:43:22.170 --> 01:43:27.490]  definitely not shouting now I mean you know for growing and smoking no no one
[01:43:27.490 --> 01:43:31.810]  maybe we don't want to smoke a joint man I'm a baby I'm a little stab away
[01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:40.810]  in the bong that's that's cool man that's why I think we probably get along
[01:43:40.810 --> 01:43:46.930]  very well is we have we have the same outlook in the same focus and you know
[01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:51.090]  at the at the same time you you know again it was it was our first
[01:43:51.090 --> 01:43:55.770]  conversation the you know your knowledge your skills I was just like my god this
[01:43:55.770 --> 01:44:01.370]  is a good conversation but you're able to spread that to people there a just
[01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:07.130]  through you know what you do daily also through you know this college but you
[01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:11.170]  know this is something that on my interview yesterday is you know they're
[01:44:11.170 --> 01:44:16.410]  like what is your biggest accomplishment and you know not to sound egotistical
[01:44:16.410 --> 01:44:20.330]  it's hard to say without it but I've always said you know if I could teach
[01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:24.970]  one person to grow and provide themselves with medicine and to be happy
[01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:29.210]  and to live a better life just one person that's fucking worth it
[01:44:29.210 --> 01:44:35.130]  everything's worth it and I have the honor and luxury of having you know like
[01:44:35.130 --> 01:44:42.290]  10 15 more people in my DM saying dude thank you this has really helped me or
[01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:50.170]  you know my my wife's PTSD is gone with this strain thank you so much
[01:44:50.170 --> 01:45:00.570]  oh man I get it's wicked man that yeah like you know weed is here each each one
[01:45:00.570 --> 01:45:08.530]  teach one man hell yeah that's the way and I'm glad that you're you know you're
[01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:13.970]  out there doing it because again the the conversation wasn't it's not as in-depth
[01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:17.890]  in the Netherlands as I thought it would be for a place that has had cannabis for
[01:45:17.890 --> 01:45:25.570]  so long so we're so far behind man but well I think wait you know coming from
[01:45:25.570 --> 01:45:31.050]  Canada working in the military over two years I think it just kind of a joke to
[01:45:31.050 --> 01:45:35.930]  be honest man like there's no there's no real I'm looking everyone else look at
[01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:40.930]  the world man and look at that you know so I can still buy it you know like a
[01:45:40.930 --> 01:45:46.490]  bottle of whiskey go crazy man like yeah but I can't have a smoke and I can still
[01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:53.450]  buy cigarettes me for real I can buy some but I can't smoke me I think I think
[01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:57.890]  people when I was in England people like oh no you can't smoke here I said what
[01:45:57.890 --> 01:46:03.930]  why not because people I think I said so what that's what I thought man and the
[01:46:03.930 --> 01:46:08.890]  guy was like I thought smoking without police guy and the guy said yeah sorry
[01:46:08.890 --> 01:46:15.370]  mate you can't smoke I said excuse me are you smoking illegal substances no I
[01:46:15.370 --> 01:46:26.730]  said he said I know you can't smoke a hammer but if you just go a little bit
[01:46:26.730 --> 01:46:31.170]  away I said I work in with all right no worries all right just give me the rules
