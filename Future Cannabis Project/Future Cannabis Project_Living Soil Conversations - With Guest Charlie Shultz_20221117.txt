[00:00.000 --> 00:03.880]  Good morning, Living Soil Nerds. Happy Thursday to you.
[00:03.880 --> 00:08.040]  You know, Leighton and myself, we've been kind of really going out of our way, hopefully,
[00:08.040 --> 00:13.320]  to bring you guests that are thought-provoking. You know, there's a lot of, you know, hopefully
[00:13.320 --> 00:17.840]  discussion going on, especially these last few episodes we've done, Leighton, where people
[00:17.840 --> 00:22.080]  just are trying to think about outside of the box. And, you know, Luna brought up some
[00:22.080 --> 00:26.440]  points to where the audience wanted to talk. You know, we dove deep with Marco yesterday.
[00:26.440 --> 00:30.600]  So there's a lot of new information that feels like coming out. Some people feel certain
[00:30.600 --> 00:36.000]  ways about both sides of things. But here, in my opinion, aquaponics is another one of
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.360]  those, right? I don't think enough people fully understand everything. So if one person
[00:41.360 --> 00:45.920]  says, this is how I feel about it, it seems like sometimes, you know, there's a lot of
[00:45.920 --> 00:49.080]  echo chambers with that, where you ask them like, all right, well, how long you've been
[00:49.080 --> 00:53.720]  growing with aquaponics? Well, I've never actually done it. Or, you know, my style is
[00:53.720 --> 00:58.720]  I don't use that style. So today, we've gone out of our way through Leighton to reach out
[00:58.720 --> 01:02.640]  to his buddy, Charlie, who was just telling me before we came live here that he's been
[01:02.640 --> 01:08.160]  doing this for 30 years. So I mean, talk about somebody that we can learn from. Obviously,
[01:08.160 --> 01:11.640]  experience goes a long, long way with this kind of stuff when you're first getting into
[01:11.640 --> 01:12.640]  it. Leighton?
[01:12.640 --> 01:20.080]  Yeah, Charlie, I met him back in, oh, God, was it 10, Charlie? Or nine? Or I don't even
[01:21.080 --> 01:22.080]  remember.
[01:22.080 --> 01:25.080]  It must be 10, probably. Yeah. 2010.
[01:25.080 --> 01:31.400]  The second annual World Aquaculture Aquaponics Conference down in Cancun, Mexico, with a
[01:31.400 --> 01:38.200]  lot of other cats that were pretty much the, you know, I'd say the superstars of the industry
[01:38.200 --> 01:43.880]  at that time. Since then, obviously, it's grown tremendously. But no, I had deep respect
[01:43.880 --> 01:48.320]  for Charlie. Again, he's been doing it for 30 plus years. He worked on the system called
[01:48.360 --> 01:58.040]  the UVI system, which I believe is probably the best approach to aquaponics while keeping
[01:58.040 --> 02:03.720]  it simple, stupid. So without further ado, Charlie, why don't you tell us about your
[02:03.720 --> 02:06.360]  background and how you got into this and where you came from?
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.720]  Awesome. Great. Thanks, Brian and Leighton for bringing me here. And I'm looking at the
[02:11.720 --> 02:15.960]  chats. It's really great to see that you all have not just people viewing, but people who
[02:15.960 --> 02:20.200]  are going to be interactive. I understand this is a three hour conversation that we're
[02:20.200 --> 02:26.960]  going to have and keeping it candid and just I'm a candid person at these this time in
[02:26.960 --> 02:32.920]  my life and most of my career. I have worked for a university or a college. I have been
[02:32.920 --> 02:37.920]  involved in private industry as well. So I understand a lot that goes with that. But
[02:37.920 --> 02:43.040]  right now, the way I like to say it is I'm open source. I'm in the knowledge business.
[02:43.040 --> 02:47.520]  Thank you for sharing these websites. They're going to come up as we as we have conversation
[02:47.520 --> 02:51.960]  today. I'd love for you all to check out our resources there and our program. I'll be talking
[02:51.960 --> 02:58.680]  about what I do. But it's a it's a fascinating time to be in this industry. So with a lot
[02:58.680 --> 03:03.840]  of experience I'm going to talk about here, we'll get to it as we talk different stories.
[03:03.840 --> 03:11.800]  But I'm probably most well known as being Jim Ricossi's mini me. Jim Ricossi was the
[03:11.800 --> 03:17.760]  some consider the god of aquaponics. He ran the UVI aquaponics system. He started that
[03:17.760 --> 03:25.400]  program. I spent about 13 years with him being the guy doing the aquaponics. He sat in the
[03:25.400 --> 03:31.600]  office and directed research and understood what we needed to focus on, on balancing aquaponics
[03:31.600 --> 03:38.340]  systems, how much fish feed goes in, how much plants you can grow and being very consistent
[03:38.340 --> 03:43.740]  in creating a production model for limited resource farmers. It's been copied around the
[03:43.740 --> 03:49.620]  world now. So that's my I would say claim to fame. But I discovered aquaponics a little while
[03:49.620 --> 03:55.620]  before that. As we talk today, you'll also understand that over 30 years, the industry has
[03:55.620 --> 04:01.680]  evolved, the industry has changed. We didn't even have the internet when I started aquaponics. So
[04:01.680 --> 04:07.460]  there was no podcast like this. There was no way to find this kind of information, except for a
[04:07.460 --> 04:14.140]  scientific journal. So if any of you remember the late 80s, early 90s, or prior to that, that's how
[04:14.140 --> 04:20.820]  we found information was doing literature reviews, going to the library, the card catalog, the Dewey
[04:20.820 --> 04:26.660]  decimal system that I don't even think exists anymore. So I started honing in on the little bit
[04:26.660 --> 04:32.860]  of research that was out there in the world. And I started to find Jim Ricossi and a couple other
[04:32.860 --> 04:38.420]  sites that were doing aquaponics. So I have been around since the beginning of this kind of new
[04:38.420 --> 04:46.140]  commercial sector of aquaponics or industrial way of doing aquaponics. But aquaponics, as most of
[04:46.140 --> 04:53.500]  your listeners know, have been around since ancient times, from Aztecs and floating gardens down in
[04:53.500 --> 04:58.340]  the Mexico region. If you haven't seen the chinampas, it's pretty fascinating because they
[04:58.340 --> 05:05.100]  still exist. And so if we look at the history of aquaponics, it probably starts there. On the other side of
[05:05.100 --> 05:11.100]  the globe, in China, they've been doing it for centuries and centuries, with rice paddies and
[05:11.260 --> 05:18.860]  intermingling fish and aquatic plants in different ways, and farming on water. And they do that today
[05:18.860 --> 05:25.180]  still. If you look, there's been National Geographic issues not long ago talking about farming on water,
[05:25.180 --> 05:31.980]  and there's entire communities that still build floating islands and crop on the water and getting their
[05:31.980 --> 05:39.100]  nutrition and their all those plant promoting enzymes and everything else that's happening in a conventional
[05:39.100 --> 05:45.180]  aquaponics system is happening in those ancient lake systems as well, as well. I kind of stumble when I say
[05:45.180 --> 05:51.500]  that word to what's happening there. What's in an aquaponics system? What's the magic? Because most of my
[05:51.500 --> 05:58.700]  career as a pioneer and working with the pioneers, we saw that as the black box. We didn't know what was
[05:58.700 --> 06:05.700]  happening. But we knew that we could couple fish and plants together in a symbiotic relationship, where the fish
[06:05.700 --> 06:13.140]  took care of the plants and the plants took care of the fish. And we don't rely on buying artificial nutrients. We
[06:13.180 --> 06:20.000]  we do supply nutrients, but that's through the form of fish food. Our mandate was to grow food. And so protein was a
[06:20.000 --> 06:26.800]  big part of it. And I got into aquaculture before I got into aquaponics, even, because it is the most sustainable
[06:26.800 --> 06:34.640]  way to produce an animal protein for humanity. And you shared some of my sites already on that Facebook site I put
[06:34.640 --> 06:41.240]  recently, I think it was yesterday, as a matter of fact, on the planet, we reached 8 billion people. Yesterday,
[06:41.280 --> 06:49.640]  we, there's a hallmark moment. When I was born, there were 3.5 billion people. Yesterday, we hit 8 billion. That's
[06:49.640 --> 06:56.920]  dramatic. Then I look at the climate change and what we're doing and impacting our climate negatively. So we can't
[06:56.920 --> 07:04.720]  farm in certain regions anymore. It's becoming more inhospitable. In my region, when the hailstorms come through in
[07:05.080 --> 07:13.160]  September, October, it crushes everybody's crops, from tomatoes to hemp to cannabis, whatever's outdoors is
[07:13.160 --> 07:22.560]  destroyed. When I ran a private farm in Texas, we had 3 100-year floods in one year. Everybody's crops were
[07:22.560 --> 07:29.680]  destroyed, except anybody who's using controlled-environment agriculture. So moving indoors, protecting your crops
[07:29.680 --> 07:36.280]  from the elements is what I specialize in now. There's different ways we can grow in a controlled environment and
[07:36.280 --> 07:42.560]  different crops we can grow. So a program like mine, I'll get to in a minute, but we used to be a greenhouse
[07:42.560 --> 07:49.960]  management. But we do so much more. We do farming in shipping containers. We do farming in indoor grows, where we have
[07:49.960 --> 07:59.640]  to focus our students on HVAC and plumbing skills. So I've evolved from a researcher into a teacher. I've developed a
[07:59.640 --> 08:06.240]  program at Santa Fe Community College, following in the footsteps of a couple colleagues of mine. One of them, Eric
[08:06.360 --> 08:12.760]  Heifield, has been a guest on your show before, I believe. Thumbs up. There's Eric Heifield. We can search for that and
[08:12.760 --> 08:20.680]  probably find it. He, he pioneered and founded this program. So he and I had been colleagues before. And actually,
[08:20.680 --> 08:27.520]  probably we knew Leighton way back in those days as well. Eric started this program. I've picked it up. And we've really
[08:27.520 --> 08:35.120]  created state-of-the-art facilities. And we're training the workforce of the future. So that's our mandate at Santa
[08:35.240 --> 08:42.280]  Fe Community College now, training the workforce of the future. But I inspire a lot of students to also go into higher
[08:42.280 --> 08:50.560]  education. Because now what we're trying to do is look in that black box. What is happening in an aquaponic system? Back in
[08:50.560 --> 08:57.400]  the day, Jim Ricossi, Don Bailey, some of the researchers that we're going to talk about today, we just knew that it worked.
[08:57.400 --> 09:05.480]  And we were more involved in setting that balance. What's the sweet spot for these systems to basically be mindless, to
[09:05.480 --> 09:13.040]  be carefree? One where truly the fish take care of the plants and the plants take care of the fish, and you sleep well at
[09:13.040 --> 09:21.280]  night. That was our mission, create a system that was simple, again, for limited-resource farmers. So we've gone a long
[09:21.280 --> 09:29.360]  way now. We'll talk today about the, maybe the future of aquaponics and who are the current pioneers. But I would say that
[09:29.360 --> 09:37.560]  microbial identification, which almost all of your listeners are very interested in, that's the focus for a lot of the young
[09:37.560 --> 09:45.200]  researchers, the people who are jumping into aquaponics right now. But I do, we will stress today that you've got to, you've
[09:45.200 --> 09:53.400]  got to find that foundation. You've got to go back in time before groups had YouTube and before groups had these social media
[09:53.400 --> 10:03.840]  platforms. It's very hard to find somebody like Jim Ricossi in the, on YouTube. There may be 3 videos of the God of aquaponics or
[10:03.840 --> 10:12.000]  the Godfather of aquaponics. So really, we need to go back and get into the library and get into your lit searches and get into
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.200]  peer-reviewed articles. And now it's out there. It's all about the biology. And it's nice. I'm seeing some of these pop up. And
[10:19.280 --> 10:21.240]  those are very appropriate comments.
[10:21.640 --> 10:27.760]  So I'll just, I'll pause here, because we can kind of walk through some of the history and some of where I've been. But I do
[10:27.760 --> 10:36.680]  always want to say I've stood on the shoulders of giants. I made that a focus of my career was to work with the best of the best.
[10:36.840 --> 10:43.880]  And I think Leighton has done that in his life. And he and I have probably talked about that. We hone in on the best people doing the
[10:43.880 --> 10:50.880]  best work. And we go and we gather what we can from them. And then we're also doers. I grab that knowledge and I create.
[10:51.200 --> 10:59.800]  Everywhere I've been, I've left a wake of aquaponic community behind me. So, so if, if you consider Jim Ricossi the God of
[10:59.800 --> 11:07.400]  aquaponic, many people consider me the Messiah. My wife does, at least. I'm out traveling the world and I'm preaching aquaponics as
[11:07.400 --> 11:19.840]  a aquavangelist. I'm also, I say this often is that colleagues and myself, we talk more people out of doing aquaponics than
[11:19.840 --> 11:27.960]  doing aquaponics. It's a 7-day-a-week. It's horticulture. It's, you know, I think, Brian, you said earlier that maybe we had a
[11:27.960 --> 11:34.200]  private conversation, but about a lot of people who just, they, they read it and they absorb all the YouTubes and everything, but
[11:34.200 --> 11:42.040]  they don't do it. They don't jump into it and start doing it. So my advice is to go get a fish tank. If you've never done
[11:42.080 --> 11:49.200]  aquaponics in your life, and you have a kind of a fear of that hurdle of jumping in, the first thing you know, need to know how
[11:49.200 --> 11:58.320]  to do is to cultivate fish. And the easiest way to do that is go get an aquarium and get some goldfish, cheap goldfish. And
[11:58.320 --> 12:03.000]  you're going to have some pets. You're going to get to know their personalities. They're going to get to know you. So you're
[12:03.000 --> 12:10.920]  going to have fun with just some goldfish. Don't worry about the plants yet. You need to understand the fish cycle of breaking
[12:10.920 --> 12:19.640]  in a new aquarium. And that's just like breaking in a 29,000-gallon system, like we ran at UVI. It's the same process. It
[12:19.640 --> 12:26.240]  takes time. You start feeding your fish and they create some ammonia. And see, now we're getting into chemistry. And some of
[12:26.240 --> 12:34.040]  you may leave the room real quick. We won't do too much chemistry here. But that's chemistry. Fish create ammonia. And if
[12:34.120 --> 12:42.200]  you don't have good bacteria that eat ammonia, your fish die because the ammonia becomes toxic. So we rely on the good bacteria
[12:42.200 --> 12:50.680]  to convert that ammonia to nitrite. And then we rely on more good bacteria to convert nitrite to nitrate. And now you have an
[12:50.680 --> 12:58.160]  acclimated system. You have a fish system that has good beneficial bacteria that control your ammonia level. They control
[12:58.160 --> 13:08.400]  your nitrite level. And they produce relatively non-toxic nitrates. So that's the process of aquaponics. The reason we put in
[13:08.400 --> 13:17.200]  plants now is to clean up those nitrates that are produced. Eventually that would become toxic to your fish. And I teach class.
[13:17.200 --> 13:25.120]  So what I tell my students is, if you've ever had an aquarium, your mom used to tell you to do a dilution about once a month.
[13:25.120 --> 13:32.240]  Take about one-third of the water and then go put it, fresh water, top it off with fresh water. But put that diluted water that
[13:32.240 --> 13:38.980]  you took off on your houseplants. And we had the best houseplants. So I didn't know it when I was a young kid that I was doing
[13:38.980 --> 13:44.880]  aquaponics, if that's aquaponics. Now we're talking about is that decoupled aquaponics? And then there's, that's a whole
[13:44.880 --> 13:55.720]  another discussion we'll get into. So once I understood that, I was just throwing away nutrients. Anybody who does a dilution in
[13:55.720 --> 14:04.840]  their system is throwing away fertilizer. So we started to couple systems together with plants. Looking for plants that work well with
[14:04.840 --> 14:12.360]  the fish. That's the idea of aquaponics. And that's a balanced system where everything's taking care of each other. Again, we'll get
[14:12.360 --> 14:19.280]  into other things like decoupled aquaponics and these other topics that are hot right now. And, but let's, let's go ahead and pause
[14:19.280 --> 14:25.360]  and I'll let you guys, I can't really see the chat. So if there's anything that's come up already that we want to go in a certain
[14:25.360 --> 14:26.480]  direction, just let me know.
[14:27.960 --> 14:34.280]  Yeah, we usually save questions for last. We just kind of get into a conversation and I would imagine today, sir, there'll be a lot of
[14:34.280 --> 14:41.640]  questions at the end. So we'll probably maybe cut the conversation a little bit shorter to allow that. When we're, when we're
[14:41.640 --> 14:49.600]  defining things, like, especially for the cannabis world, you know, the hot verbiage is living soil. So when you, when you say like
[14:49.600 --> 14:55.720]  aquaponics, can you define that as simply as like the microbes feeding the fish and the fish are feeding the microbes?
[14:56.960 --> 15:03.720]  Honestly, you'll find if you're any of your growers who are interested in aquaponics, cannabis are going to find Steve Rassner or
[15:03.720 --> 15:10.360]  Steve Dread, Potent Ponics, some, some of those websites. And I was recently in Guadalajara, Steve did a virtual
[15:10.360 --> 15:19.720]  presentation. And my take-home from some of his work is that he classifies this as aquatic soil. That's what we're working
[15:19.720 --> 15:26.480]  with. And we're building aquatic soil. We talk about living soil when you're talking earth and what's connected to Mother
[15:26.480 --> 15:35.520]  Earth. That's could be considered that that type of soil. This is aquatic soil. When you look at the analysis of what's in an
[15:35.520 --> 15:43.560]  aquaponics system versus what's in a living soil analysis, from what I hear, and I haven't dug into the research, we are many
[15:43.560 --> 15:52.400]  times ahead in diversity and numbers of beneficial microbes in an aquatic soil. What I've seen in my experience is over the
[15:52.400 --> 16:00.400]  years, my systems become better. They become more robust, they become more diverse in that microbial diversity and
[16:00.400 --> 16:09.160]  community. That my lettuce production in year seven is better than in year two. It's better and it continues to be over time on
[16:09.160 --> 16:17.720]  these closed loop systems. I think again, most of your listeners here that are going to watch this live or later, understand
[16:17.720 --> 16:26.560]  some of the ideas of aquaponics where we're recycling 99% of our water every day. This is a paradigm shift from hydroponic
[16:26.560 --> 16:35.920]  growing, which is conventional fertilizers and kind of managing a nutrient reservoir. This is about being consistent day in and
[16:35.920 --> 16:44.480]  day out, running very low levels of certain nutrients. Beyond logic, when you look at hydroponic literature, how can I produce
[16:44.480 --> 16:56.280]  commercial yields of tomatoes at 0.4 EC? That some people have source water that has more nutrients than that. I ran 0.4 EC for
[16:56.280 --> 17:07.040]  almost 13 years at the Virgin Islands, recycling 98.5% every day, just topping off 1.5 that the plants were using. That
[17:07.200 --> 17:17.880]  nutrient profile was ideal for plant production. We ran low ECs because the plants were using what we gave them from the fish waste. But we
[17:17.880 --> 17:30.400]  also put in more nutrients every day through the fish feed. Our system fed 40 pounds of fish feed every day, 365 days. We weighed out feed
[17:30.400 --> 17:40.600]  breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We weighed every pellet for 13 years that I was there. We have very good data there. The other important
[17:40.600 --> 17:49.320]  part about the UVI data that's all open source, and I'll talk about where your listeners can find some of that, is we started with rainwater.
[17:50.640 --> 17:59.520]  Our source water wasn't influenced by any of the minerals that we all would have in our source water. We would usually have different
[17:59.520 --> 18:09.880]  makeups of nutrients. If I did all that UVI research using our well water, for instance, it would have calcium and magnesium. Ours would
[18:09.880 --> 18:18.480]  have a lot of sodium in it as well. It would have influenced all of our research findings and made it not really relatable to what Brian's
[18:18.480 --> 18:26.400]  doing or any of our other listeners, wherever you are. We started with pure rainwater. I think that was a blessing in disguise that we were
[18:26.400 --> 18:34.720]  limited in water. We had to catch rainwater. That was our only source. Now when I look back, I can really rely on that water quality data
[18:34.720 --> 18:43.040]  that's in some of the literature that's out there. Pure gold. Thanks. I would say with that, because I'm a teacher, I'm going to go ahead and
[18:43.040 --> 18:52.120]  give you the advice is to be looking for peer reviewed information that's been looked at by other experts in your field and validated in a
[18:52.120 --> 19:01.160]  paid for journal. Usually one way to find access is scholar.google. Now there's a lot of ways to find access, but that's just a quick one that I
[19:01.160 --> 19:07.920]  mentioned to students. It's easy to remember if you're out on the road and you're looking for some research, whether it's LED lighting,
[19:08.320 --> 19:18.360]  aquaponics, microbial communities, tilapia disease, anything that you can think of. I go to scholar.google first. So I'm going to put in
[19:18.800 --> 19:30.480]  aquaponics and UVI for University of the Virgin Islands. Or I'm going to do aquaponics and Jim Ricosi or my name, Charlie Schultz. But if you
[19:30.480 --> 19:40.400]  put in the UVI system, aquaponics, you're going to find our peer reviewed information that has a focus on economic analysis as well. Again, we
[19:40.400 --> 19:50.880]  were mandated to produce a system for a limited resource farmer. The system has one water pump. Very simple system. Leighton's going to
[19:50.880 --> 19:58.720]  jump on in a minute and we're going to discuss some of maybe of the kingdom aquaponics stuff that we had planned for many years that was in the
[19:58.720 --> 20:08.880]  works. And it was a beautiful project that had a very much a UVI style system as the heartbeat of that whole project. And what I see around
[20:08.880 --> 20:17.120]  the world now is we say there's a replica of a UVI system on every continent except Antarctica. But absolutely there's spinoff and
[20:17.120 --> 20:27.720]  variations of the UVI system everywhere. We're loaded around the world with people who are using the conventional slow settling of solid for
[20:27.840 --> 20:35.880]  solids removal. Just get your solids out slowly. You can remineralize them if you want and put them back. We'll talk about that as this goes
[20:35.920 --> 20:46.240]  through. But the deep water culture method, the floating rafts hydroponic technique. That's what the UVI system is famous for using for a lot of
[20:46.240 --> 20:55.160]  reasons. It really helped us stagger production when we're doing cropping for markets. You want consistency. So we basically split our system up in
[20:55.160 --> 21:04.600]  25 percent quadrants. So one quarter we would plant every week and eventually you get on a cycle of harvesting one quarter every week
[21:04.880 --> 21:15.040]  transplanting back in that same day and keeping on a cycle. So I get back to the aquaponic system there. Consistency is the key. If I'm putting in
[21:15.040 --> 21:24.040]  40 pounds of fish feed every day or you're putting in three pounds or you're putting in 30 grams depending on the size of the system we're all
[21:24.040 --> 21:35.040]  using. Be consistent. Put in that same amount of fish feed every day and then stagger your crop production so you have uniform uptake of
[21:35.280 --> 21:46.440]  nutrients. That's how you get a consistent crop a consistent system that can maintain itself with perfect water quality for the fish and
[21:46.440 --> 21:56.720]  perfect nutrient profile for the plants where they're not showing deficiencies or reducing yield. So that's what the UVI system created. When we
[21:56.720 --> 22:07.520]  looked at that system any day of the week the plants were perfect. Whether I was growing tomatoes or basil or okra or cantaloupe or zinnia
[22:07.560 --> 22:16.960]  flowers everything in the same system. It's the one nutrient solution. And again that's the paradigm shift from hydroponics. I'm not using a basil
[22:16.960 --> 22:27.520]  fertilizer or a tomato formula or a cantaloupe fertilizer. I have fish water and I know what it is. It's a general fertilizer but it's full of this
[22:27.520 --> 22:38.200]  microbial community and these plants don't seem to need to be to have that specificity of nutrient profiles like a hydroponic system. We also
[22:38.200 --> 22:51.960]  don't follow the golden rule in hydroponics of keeping that pH at 5.8. Right. Every hydroponic grower is 5.8 to 6.2 6.0 at the UVI system for 13
[22:52.040 --> 23:04.440]  years we ran at 7.0. Nobody does that anymore. Nobody runs at that high. I even have moved my recommendation down to 6.4. That's my sweet spot for my
[23:04.440 --> 23:14.640]  aquaponic systems. And when you know about nitrification and the ammonia going to nitrite going to nitrate that's an acidifying process. So your
[23:14.680 --> 23:26.280]  aquaponic system pH always drops a golden rule. So as a grower your arsenal should be a base something that moves your pH up because it's always
[23:26.280 --> 23:35.200]  going to. The more you feed the more your pH will drop. So we have bases that we add to bump up the pH. And if you're going to bump up the pH
[23:35.480 --> 23:41.080]  you want to use a base that has an essential nutrient attached to it as well.
[23:45.110 --> 23:55.070]  Charlie. Another one that's so we can Charlie can you hear me say again. OK. You glitched out as soon as you started talking about the base that you
[23:55.070 --> 24:00.670]  add. So I don't want the audience to miss it. So start over where you say we add bases.
[24:06.630 --> 24:16.540]  I think he might be froze. Charlie you might have to jump off and jump back on. I mean let the Charlie.
[24:19.100 --> 24:21.580]  If you can hear us exit and come back on.
[24:25.980 --> 24:29.220]  You want me to jump off. Yeah. Jump off and hop right back on.
[24:29.220 --> 24:40.780]  So I'll yeah I'll speak on something that he did not get into. So the interesting part of the UVA system was that he had four individual tanks for the fish
[24:40.780 --> 24:52.860]  rearing. One of the tanks he put in fry. And the last tank he'd harvest out of. So every tank had a equal amount of biomass. It just wasn't.
[24:52.980 --> 25:03.540]  It wasn't as big as the final tank. In other words you're not going to get as much nutrient out of the little fries as you are out of the big fish at the other end.
[25:04.060 --> 25:16.780]  So you're constantly rotating in a cycle of fish like he was talking about in the in the quadrants of harvesting less. It was the same thing. You only harvest one quarter each week and then plant replant one quarter.
[25:17.220 --> 25:24.060]  So it's the same idea. Both the fish were harvested every other week or every week. You're harvesting a new tank and starting a new tank.
[25:24.940 --> 25:32.500]  Can you like if you chose to use a high end fish you could like breed them up right and then sell them. Isn't there like a whole new world.
[25:33.260 --> 25:44.980]  Yeah we can we can get into that. I mean Steve is all about that. Working with the tropical fish industry instead of using a feed fish where Charlie is more about feed fish because this is about growing food.
[25:45.380 --> 25:54.260]  So both the fish and the vegetables are your food source that you get every week. All right. So back into it about the basis Charlie getting that pH to go up.
[25:54.780 --> 26:09.660]  Okay so that's a that's the common way aquaponic trend right pH will drop. The opposite happens in hydroponics. You trend your pH trends up because of cation exchange at the root zone. It's driving your pH up.
[26:10.260 --> 26:19.220]  So aquaponic grower has to be used to adding a base and we might as well add a base that has an essential nutrient attached to it.
[26:19.620 --> 26:36.380]  So I'm going to add a base with potassium or calcium maybe silica. There's different options for growers. If you want to be organic certified you're very limited in what you can use and what you're using may not be very soluble and very predictable.
[26:36.860 --> 26:49.620]  But I think once you get in a habit with your system and you know how it behaves you can use any chemical like that whether it's organic or not. It's a chemical you're putting in the water.
[26:50.100 --> 27:01.780]  You can use things like eggshells perhaps you can use oyster shells but you want to pulverize that stuff probably because it takes a long time to release and it's not really predictable.
[27:02.300 --> 27:15.100]  So there's lots of options out there for what you may use depending on your goals. Honestly if I'm growing something more like leafy greens like lettuce only I may only use a calcium base.
[27:15.500 --> 27:27.660]  So calcium hydroxide calcium bicarbonates calcium carbonates these type of things because that young delicate lettuce uses a lot of calcium as it grows quickly.
[27:28.300 --> 27:38.420]  If I'm looking at like a fruiting crop maybe looking at growing cannabis in my system or growing tomatoes in my system what I've always done is alternated.
[27:38.780 --> 27:53.020]  The first time I need to bump my pH back up use a calcium base. The next time use a potassium base. As I said some growers recommend silica and their silica products that will bump your pH up and supplement your silica.
[27:53.340 --> 28:03.500]  So be wise about what you're adding. When I try to talk to a fish farmer so that's I came from the industry of aquaculture. I was a fish farmer.
[28:04.660 --> 28:17.860]  My industry was growing hundreds of metric tons of fish and they had a waste problem. When I was in 1990 I jumped into school for this and I saw everybody around me was paying to get rid of this waste.
[28:18.340 --> 28:29.500]  That's what your mom used to say dilute from your fish tank. They were doing it on a much bigger scale. Many of you all have followed Leighton for quite a while. This is his passion is fish shit.
[28:30.020 --> 28:40.940]  Literally that fish waste and what's happening there. The research that Leighton has done over the years that I've known him every time the fish waste just blows people's minds honestly.
[28:41.420 --> 28:47.740]  And I'm going to mention a story about blowing people's mind here in a bit. I'm even going to make a note so I make sure and tell you.
[28:51.660 --> 28:58.420]  We got there we go. There it is. There's a website everybody. Right. Right.
[28:58.420 --> 29:14.020]  So let me see. So that industry was paying to get rid of waste. I saw that as a perfect opportunity to be environmentally sound produce protein. Like I said eight billion people on the planet now.
[29:14.700 --> 29:24.100]  So we're producing animal protein very sustainability using sustainable techniques recirculating systems like I'm saying water conservative.
[29:24.740 --> 29:35.780]  The other beauty of a raw system a recirculating system is we effectively efficiently collect solid waste so we can manage it. These are good examples of aquaculture.
[29:36.100 --> 29:49.820]  We're not negatively impacting the planet with our systems and we use energy but we're very water conservative. We're solid waste management perfectionist. We want that waste now. Now we know it's valuable.
[29:50.180 --> 30:01.580]  So I can collect it from these systems and do anything with it. A lot of our work in the system at UVI did not do what many systems do now where they remineralize the solid waste.
[30:01.940 --> 30:15.100]  They may discharge it temporarily break it down in a septic tank and return the nutrients back so the plants can use it. We didn't do that work in the Virgin Islands although we did some of the first research in that area.
[30:15.580 --> 30:31.340]  What we did is we use that solid waste discharge on terrestrial crops. We lived in an ideal environment where we could build soil with that fish waste. And that's where I think this aquaponics really fits in with a living soil farm.
[30:31.860 --> 30:37.420]  Sometimes there's a contentious battle between hydroponic growers and soil growers.
[30:38.020 --> 30:51.460]  Aquaponics is hydroponics. We're growing in an aquatic soil and I see this fight sometimes and I think it's a perfect complement. There's a farm out in Rogue River Oregon.
[30:52.060 --> 31:02.020]  So Rogue Oregon area. I think it's Rogue Aquaponics everybody. Check out their website if you know them. Shout them out. They're great people. Mike Hassey out there.
[31:02.860 --> 31:19.900]  He has a complimentary farm. The fish create a lot of that magic that Layton's talking about. And if we're just coupling it in a coupled aquaponics system like UVI and like all the systems that that I use and teach on that's traditional aquaponics.
[31:19.900 --> 31:29.860]  But we can also use that as the heartbeat to create other fertilizer resources for other applications for compost building for your seedling production.
[31:30.500 --> 31:39.660]  Fertilizing your fruit orchard because that's organic matter. It's slow release fertilizer as well. There's a lot we can do. So it shouldn't be a battle.
[31:40.220 --> 31:55.060]  And when we when I talk about organic certification of aquaponic crops we don't do fish. We only do crops. There's definitely a battle there. People say it's soil is gotta be in the definition. And that gets into what is soil. Right.
[31:55.100 --> 31:59.540]  And I know you all have had that discussion here and I have it with my students all the time.
[32:00.380 --> 32:20.060]  But I just I personally think that water is magic. Soil is not magic. Water is magic. When I go when we go travel to distant planets if you believe in space and that theory of space. If we travel to distant planets what are we looking for. We're looking for water.
[32:20.900 --> 32:36.580]  I can grow plants with no soil. I cannot grow plants without water. I think I've had this conversation with you Leighton that even in your soil systems I believe that around every fine hair that's an aqueous layer.
[32:37.060 --> 32:43.820]  That's a water based delivery of nutrients across those cell walls into your plant. It's hydroponics in the soil.
[32:44.540 --> 32:53.460]  But instead we're going the other way and trying to call hydroponics soil coming up with terms like aquatic soil just to fit these key words of soil.
[32:54.020 --> 33:00.860]  So I'd say break the soil marriage and just stuck on soil because we could sit here and talk about what is soil.
[33:01.460 --> 33:10.460]  Right. If you take a lot of soil and you put it in a seedling tray to do your little seedlings is that still soil. It's not connected to Mother Earth anymore.
[33:11.060 --> 33:17.500]  But there's things like that are allowed in organic certification. They'll let you do your transplants and plastic trays.
[33:18.060 --> 33:26.780]  But and then put them in soil. So I don't I just don't think soils the magic. Let's work with the resources we have. You play to your resources.
[33:27.460 --> 33:37.460]  Honestly, if you have abundant water and land soil crop use flood irrigation and furrow irrigation and grow the heck out of food for humanity.
[33:38.060 --> 33:45.820]  But where I have been challenged is I've always lived in water restrictive environments. I think I was thrown there on purpose.
[33:46.340 --> 33:54.620]  I didn't know what I was getting into, but I was thrown into very harsh environments all my life and everywhere around me. We've had to conserve water.
[33:55.260 --> 34:05.980]  Currently live in Santa Fe, New Mexico. We are drought. We are building complexes around me everywhere. Apartment complexes bringing in more and more people and we have no water.
[34:06.300 --> 34:15.580]  And I'm sitting over here on my pulpit talking about farming with 99 percent water recycling rates. You should be giving this industry tax breaks.
[34:15.900 --> 34:25.460]  Anybody who has recycled systems and we really conserve our resources as we produce food and income. We should get tax breaks for that. But currently that doesn't happen.
[34:26.020 --> 34:33.020]  So I'd like to see places like California can start things like that. And as California goes so goes the nation sometimes.
[34:33.580 --> 34:36.980]  Cool. Wow. That was a great rant, Charlie.
[34:39.380 --> 34:42.180]  And so many things to touch on in that.
[34:43.780 --> 34:52.820]  I want you to back up because I was while you were getting off and coming back on, I was explaining to the audience about four tanks and each tank had a different.
[34:54.820 --> 34:59.980]  Yeah. So why don't you talk a little bit on that? Because that was the key to balancing the nutritional load for everything.
[35:00.100 --> 35:08.940]  So I'll just reply to that. It won't take long. What we're talking about is how do you be consistent? How do you put 40 pounds of fish feed into your system every day?
[35:09.300 --> 35:21.740]  Because you're going to harvest fish, right? Like if you put in and this applies to the seedlings as well. As I said, we usually split our system in 25 percent and do crops of lettuce or basil or parsley or whatever we're growing.
[35:22.260 --> 35:35.060]  Imagine if you're consistent on the fish feed and you put all baby seedlings out in your aquaponic troughs. They're not pulling up a lot of nutrients at that point and your water quality is going to go bad.
[35:35.860 --> 35:46.860]  Then imagine 90 days later and you've got all these auto flowers out there pulling up tons of nutrients all at once. Now they're going to have deficiencies because they don't have enough.
[35:47.260 --> 35:57.900]  They're all sucking it up at one time. Instead, if you're familiar with auto flowers, if that's a crop that you want to grow, you could stagger that production. It's irregardless of photo period.
[35:58.260 --> 36:10.700]  So you could do the same kind of a third, one third or 25 percent every maybe six weeks or eight weeks, whatever schedule you set. And then you always have young plants, medium plants and old plants.
[36:11.580 --> 36:20.580]  And now you balance the uptake of nutrients. So we did that with vegetable crops. You also need to do that with your fish.
[36:21.180 --> 36:30.980]  If you only start with a bunch of baby fish and you put 10 grams in to feed them on day one, it's not going to provide a lot of nutrition for a bunch of plants on the other side.
[36:31.700 --> 36:40.940]  And then when they grow up big six or 10 months later, now you put six pounds in your tank, you may not have enough plant area. So it's all about this balance.
[36:41.660 --> 36:49.500]  If I want to get the same fish feed in there every day, I can have one fish tank or I can have multiple fish tanks.
[36:49.900 --> 37:00.580]  So I usually do multiple fish tanks and then I stagger the production. So I stock fingerlings. I usually stock with about the size of my hand, about 100 gram fish, roughly.
[37:01.460 --> 37:10.300]  That's what I start with. So I'll put 100 in my tank if that's the stocking rate. UVI, it was something like 780 fish in my tank.
[37:10.940 --> 37:20.940]  And then the other tank next to it, I would stock six weeks later. The other tank next to it, six weeks later. The other tank next to it, six weeks later. Four tank system.
[37:21.420 --> 37:35.380]  Now I'm on a six month rotation where six weeks later I harvest a tank of fish. And the day I harvest and take them off site, I bring in babies, 786 babies and put them in the same tank.
[37:36.220 --> 37:43.300]  Open up some valves, the system just falls up together. And now I've got this reduction in biomass a little bit.
[37:43.740 --> 37:56.860]  But I have these other three tanks that are still 800 pounds of fish here, 600 pounds over here, 400 pounds, 200 pounds. So it rapidly gets right back up to that 40 pounds per day, even on the day we harvest.
[37:57.460 --> 38:05.740]  So the other way to do that, there's a famous facility back in the day in Amherst, Massachusetts called Bio Shelters.
[38:06.460 --> 38:13.220]  This was a facility from John Todd. And if we really had three hours, look, it's going to go fast here, I think.
[38:13.580 --> 38:31.300]  If we really had more time, we'd talk more about the history of aquaponics and New Alchemy Institute. And John Todd and a group of people up there focused on kind of community resiliency and food production and home waste treatment, gray water systems, these kind of things.
[38:31.340 --> 38:36.620]  So if you want the foundation of aquaponics in the US, I would start with New Alchemy Institute.
[38:37.300 --> 38:41.700]  There's a lot of resources out there, and you can find what they did with algae production as well.
[38:42.580 --> 38:50.340]  John Todd went off to Bio Shelters and was the first USDA certified organic aquaponic farm in the US.
[38:50.340 --> 39:04.980]  He did only basil and tilapia. A huge one big fish tank in a barn downstairs, and he pumped everything upstairs one level and had NFT channels of certified organic basil.
[39:05.220 --> 39:14.180]  No nutrient demand. He didn't buy any fertilizer. He fed the fish for his nutrients. So he's really a pioneer that doesn't get a lot of credit here.
[39:15.180 --> 39:18.180]  We actually had Keith Wilda on here.
[39:18.420 --> 39:19.220]  Okay, great.
[39:19.460 --> 39:32.980]  Yeah. And John Todd is on the roster for the future, or his son is. So we'll be getting more of that history behind us. So we can steer away from all of that stuff and stay focused on what you've done.
[39:32.980 --> 39:33.540]  Yeah.
[39:33.540 --> 39:33.940]  Yeah.
[39:33.940 --> 39:39.620]  So let me tell you what they did there, though. They had to be consistent. He understood that. You have to be consistent.
[39:39.620 --> 39:54.660]  He may have put 200 pounds in his system a day. He had one fish tank. So the way you manage that, there's a couple ways. There's a grower here in Santa Fe that is doing this. I've taught her. You put cages in the one tank.
[39:54.660 --> 40:03.460]  You have one big tank and you put a cage and another cage. And now you have your staggered production within one big fish tank.
[40:04.020 --> 40:23.300]  And six months later, I harvest one cage. They're easy to catch because all your fish are contained. And now your system's getting consistent feed. The other way that he did it was he stocked an age every month, a new cohort the next month, a new cohort the next month.
[40:23.300 --> 40:41.140]  And they all swam together. And when it was harvest day, they had a crowding pie slice kind of thing where everything crowded together and there were grading bars and the small fish swim through and only the big fish were caught in the graded area. And that's how they harvested.
[40:41.140 --> 40:58.660]  And my opinion, that puts a lot of stress on your fish as you're handling every fish to only get the big ones. When you have little stunted fish, they're always going to swim through the bars. And so it creates stress and disease. And honestly, you can ask him probably about this, but there was a lot of disease issues.
[40:58.660 --> 41:19.300]  When I was a young student, he was the only job in aquaponics was running the fish up at bio shelters because they always had disease problems and they would fire their fish manager. They had a fish problem and they'd fire their fish manager. And I attributed a lot to the stress of handling your fish. When you have multiple fish tanks, we just shut off valves.
[41:19.300 --> 41:40.420]  We pumped the water into the rest of the system where there's extra free board space. So we didn't lose a drop of water. We harvested 1,100 pounds of fish at UVI. And the day it was soon as we did that, we opened the valves, filled it with water, restocked with young fish and moved on with our day. We had it down to a very efficient system.
[41:41.380 --> 41:57.540]  So, yeah, it sounds like you could like harvest and then obviously, you know, do that, you know, that little protocol there and then you're back up and running on that tank in the same day. So you harvest six weeks, boom, clean it up. Now that tank is back on track in the same day.
[41:57.540 --> 42:26.580]  Got it. So I could mark my calendar every six weeks. I would harvest the next tank. So I would have to back up with my fingerling production, whether you buy baby fish or you're breeding your own baby fish. You have to say every six weeks, I need 780 fish this size. So I'm going to go ahead and breed a thousand of them, grow them up with all the feed that's required for that. Or you outsource that and you bring them in. So there's different ways to do that.
[42:27.620 --> 42:36.660]  But you have to plan that just like a lettuce seedling. Or if you're in constant cannabis production, planning your planting schedule. We do that with the fish, just like plants.
[42:36.660 --> 43:01.620]  The other way, let's go in another direction. The other way is to not use a food fish and not be on this regular routine of harvesting, whether you process your fish or you just sell them live. But whatever logistics goes with that, you've got to consider. The other option is to just have some fish in there as your biomass. That's your compost machine, basically.
[43:01.700 --> 43:22.660]  Your aquatic composter. And you have a beautiful koi that's there. You have goldfish. I have six different types of fish that I grow at the college. From catfish and tilapia on the edible side. I have common carp, which is the most consumed and farmed fish on the planet. But then I have goldfish and I have koi, beautiful fish like that.
[43:23.620 --> 43:45.620]  I also have some biological controls, a gambusia, which is a mosquito fish that can go around under my rafts and get things like the fungus gnat larvae that sometimes will start to populate in your system. I use a little fish to control that. If they get really out of control, I can put a little nematode on top of the surface to go get those little fungus gnat larvae.
[43:46.340 --> 44:06.500]  So the fish is, I say what are your goals, honestly? If you're not into harvesting meat and selling animals like that for food production, consider things like the koi and the goldfish. There's a lot of other species, like we talked about, the tropical industry, a lot of valuable fish.
[44:07.460 --> 44:34.500]  I remind my students, because we do have a lot of beautiful koi around my facility, that recently the most valuable koi sold at an auction for $2.4 million for one fish. So if that's the high end, you know there's market potential all the way down that chain for you to be the $1,000 fish guy, the $20 fish, wherever you think you could fit. My advice on that is to-
[44:34.500 --> 44:44.500]  I have to stop you for a second, brother, because if you look at Brian's face right now, and you can see the bloody gears spinning, uh oh.
[44:44.500 --> 45:08.500]  So my advice on that is, I'm not a koi collector, so I don't know the market, but you've got to study your markets in anything. So you find the koi club in Denver, you find the koi club in your community, you go on Craigslist and you find out there's three guys that are already selling koi. You find the one store that's out there.
[45:08.500 --> 45:35.500]  We have a store here in town and they just have a fascinating koi business and they sell it to a lot of rich people who keep beautiful koi here in Santa Fe. If that koi gets sick, he has a business where he goes and collects the fish back for $200 to $300, brings it to his raw system in his store, treats the fish, because he can't do it as a private business owner. You can't go treat their koi medically in their pond.
[45:35.500 --> 45:55.500]  He brings it back to his facility where it's his fish because he just bought it, kind of this relationship. He treats it, gives it back, and he makes again $300 to $400. And he does that nonstop because when the weather gets cold, the fungus is going to hit an outdoor fish like a koi. And so he's got some bank money. He found his niche.
[45:55.500 --> 46:23.500]  I have a good connection. I'll get it to Brian. So if anybody needs a good connection for your koi, they sell them by the box loads, hundreds at a time. And that's good biomass. You don't need to ever harvest those fish. If you get a shipment of 100 koi and you have systems where those 100 koi could grow up to three, four pounds, you keep beautiful koi. And one day you'll be like, anybody want these? $500 each. And people will just come pick fish.
[46:23.500 --> 46:41.500]  But you have to have that community. You have to find that community around you. I used to think that the world of the internet was taking away the aquarium trade. The people who used to sit and watch an aquarium are now just watching websites and stuff. So I really would be careful just jumping in that industry.
[46:41.500 --> 47:03.500]  The other thing is, I'll see if I can just tilt a little bit. Kentucky State University, that's my alma mater. I got my master's degree out of there. They have a world of resources on YouTube. And specifically in koi breeding, we often have to use hormone and hormone spawning. So they show you the exact ways to do that.
[47:03.500 --> 47:32.500]  What they're looking at as well, the industry in koi, is if you can predict the color patterns, now you're at the $10,000 fishes and the $100,000 fishes. There's certain color patterns that we're looking for. There's one that looks just like the Japanese flag, just a big red dot on the head. There's different color patterns that make it more valuable. And if you're interested in genetics, anybody here, I would seriously look at Kentucky State University as your master's degree school.
[47:33.500 --> 47:47.500]  They pay you to go to school there. And you can study fish genetics under my researcher who's from Russia. It's about inheritance of color patterns in koi. And if we can figure that out as an industry, somebody's going to be making a lot of money.
[47:47.500 --> 48:10.500]  The other thing about koi is you're getting married to your fish. The oldest koi on record is still living at 254 years old. That's your fish. You're married to that fish. So you're going to pass your aquaponic system down to your kids and their grandkids and on and on and on. So you're married once you get these species.
[48:11.500 --> 48:23.500]  Tilapia, typically we keep for a year. We grow that fish to about a kilo. We process it into two beautiful fillets once it's a kilo-sized fish. So that's the process. It's about one year from an egg.
[48:24.500 --> 48:26.500]  I also had mentioned that.
[48:26.500 --> 48:30.500]  Duffel bag boys with the fish, you know, throwing them kilos in the duffel bag.
[48:30.500 --> 48:45.500]  Exactly. You know what? Honestly, Brian, I'll mention this at this point is I teach chemistry at my classes now. We'll talk about my program here in a minute. But as I teach chemistry, students are a little intimidated.
[48:46.500 --> 49:01.500]  And what I say is start to visualize what the hell you're talking about. If I'm talking about a kilo, whether you are the one hustling it or not, you know what it looks like. You've seen enough fucking TV. Right? And you know what a gram should look like.
[49:02.500 --> 49:15.500]  Whether it's a gram of gold or a gram of something else, you should be able to visualize. And then you should be able to visualize a milligram. Because if you really want to be a good botanist and a horticulturist, you've got to start to know the plant.
[49:15.500 --> 49:21.500]  And we've got to start to know plant nutrients. So we've got to start to know how plants respond and uptake nutrients.
[49:22.500 --> 49:34.500]  So we have to start to know about the controlled environment that they're living in, in the aerial world, the relative humidity, the vapor pressure deficit, the light demands. There's a lot of science involved in being a good grower.
[49:35.500 --> 49:51.500]  So with chemistry, just don't be intimidated. When I show a periodic table, I remind them that there's only 13 nutrients that plants need that we need to supply. We don't supply carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. We supply 13 other nutrients.
[49:52.500 --> 50:05.500]  And that's what we're looking at when I analyze an aquaponic system. Because they're closed loop and they're recycling water, you do want to look at an analysis periodically, depending on your budget.
[50:06.500 --> 50:20.500]  And I can get, again, Brian, some links here. They'll keep coming up here. I'll get you some links. But there's an analysis for $25 is about what I pay. And it tells me the nutrients that are in the water, the plant-based nutrients.
[50:21.500 --> 50:39.500]  If you know those 13 nutrients, your macro, micronutrients, right, we could all do it together. CHO, NPK, magnesium, calcium and sulfur are your macronutrients. Iron, boron, zinc, copper chloride, molybdenum and manganese are your micronutrients and some would include nickel.
[50:39.500 --> 50:52.500]  You should be able to do that if you want to be a good grower. You should take an aquaponic water sample and send it away and look at the profile. Look at what's happening in your water and be able to manage that if you want to.
[50:53.500 --> 51:12.500]  Or at least just know what's happening. Trust that the system will balance itself. Trust that UVI did this for 30 years solid and didn't rely on a lot of inputs. I'm a purist when it comes to aquaponics. I'm a fish farmer. And I want to find plants that can remediate my waste.
[51:12.500 --> 51:39.500]  That can clean my effluent disposal problem and give me a second crop. I don't, I personally am not looking to tailor fish water to a high value crop like cannabis. If I wanted to do that, I may do cannabis as hydroponics. I'm also an advocate for hydroponics. I can dial in that crop. A lot of what you see around is hydroponically grown with salts. I crush it with that.
[51:40.500 --> 51:58.500]  But it's all about your goals. The goals going back to food fish versus ornamental fish. That's whatever your goals are. The plants are as well. Some people come to this on the fish side. Some people come to this from the plant side.
[51:59.500 --> 52:16.500]  So if you're a grower of a plant and you have a goal, let's say cannabis or let's say tomatoes or let's say lettuce, whatever your goals are, we have that conversation about, well, what fish is going to be best for that system? And one of the first criteria we have to look at is the temperature.
[52:16.500 --> 52:37.500]  What's the ideal root zone temperature for cannabis? What's the ideal root zone temperature for lettuce, for kale, whatever you want to grow, because that's where you want to dial in your water. If your focus is plants, focus on your plant optimum conditions. So a lot of our plants, we're talking 70 degree Fahrenheit.
[52:38.500 --> 53:03.500]  Now that limits me on my fish selection. As much as people want me to grow trout, I can't grow trout. I cannot produce 58 degree water or 54 is even more idealized, 50 even better for trout. How do I make 50 degree water? I would have to use a lot of energy. I'd have to use chillers and chill my water so I can grow trout.
[53:04.500 --> 53:30.500]  And then what do I grow in trout water? What can I grow in 10 degrees Celsius or 50 degree Fahrenheit? I can grow the hell out of wasabi, but that's a three year crop. I won't make any money in three years. And if you get a root fungus move in, that rhizome just dies. I've grown a lot of watercress with trout. So if you do have a cold water source, consider trout because it is accepted well in the market.
[53:30.500 --> 53:53.500]  People like the idea of trout, smoked trout even better, but you're dealing with 50 to 54 degree water and watercress is a great match. Chefs love aquaponic watercress because it has no dirt. Sorry if you're into soil, I'm sorry, but your watercress usually has grit and sand and other aggregates in there and chefs don't like that.
[53:54.500 --> 54:08.500]  When I give them mine trimmed right off the top of my hydroton, they don't even have to wash it. They eat that and it is so spicy and they put it right on their sandwiches and no customer will ever complain about grit. I'm sorry, soil, soil aggregates.
[54:08.500 --> 54:25.500]  So we look at the temperature and now if I'm dealing with 70 degree temperature crops, which most of us are, it limits me to tilapia, catfish, which some growers are successful with, but most catfish growers have disease problems.
[54:25.500 --> 54:41.500]  And I recommend growers not to use catfish. They're not used to being in tanks. They don't like swimming around in circles all the time. They like bottom space. A tank is this vertical container. It's the worst thing for a catfish in my opinion.
[54:41.500 --> 55:02.500]  Where I put my catfish are under the troughs where we float plants now. Sometimes you'll get a little debris settling in the bottom of your trough, which over time can be problematic. I put a big catfish in and they swim along the bottom and kick up the debris, which makes it back through my filtration system. So I use them as kind of a control in my system.
[55:03.500 --> 55:29.500]  So tilapia, catfish, koi, and goldfish. That's what we see often in aquaponics and that's why we see that. A lot of people are like, oh, he's doing tilapia. I'm an advocate for tilapia. That's the fish that they say Jesus fed the masses with. That's the fish that's been on hieroglyphics and the Egyptian pyramids. That's the fish of the future. That fish is grown on every continent as well. It's very marketable.
[55:29.500 --> 55:54.500]  I honestly, I call tilapia the tofu of fish because when you grow it in controlled environments, it has no taste. It's a piece of white meat and chefs love that. They can put spice on it. They can make it taste any way they want. And when the doctors are telling the consumers to eat more fish, a lot of people don't like fishy fish. They like a bland fish. So that's a really good option for them.
[55:55.500 --> 56:06.500]  Again, we've got a lot of time, but I talk for semesters sometimes on tilapia. It's a really valuable fish for us to use for a lot of different things.
[56:06.500 --> 56:13.500]  And they're good looking. You see them in tropical pet stores. They're pretty fish. Many different colors.
[56:13.500 --> 56:18.500]  They've got a stigma though, right? I'm sure if we said everybody raise your hand.
[56:18.500 --> 56:21.500]  Well, the stigma is that they bottom feed, right?
[56:22.500 --> 56:24.500]  Well, they're omnivores. They'll eat anything.
[56:25.500 --> 56:41.500]  That's a stigma. So I'll respond to some of that fake media. And I can tell you that this is actually not a conspiracy, but the US Catfish Association has been throwing you propaganda about how bad tilapia is.
[56:42.500 --> 56:53.500]  The US catfish industry has been throwing you propaganda against what we call this Vietnamese import called Bassa or Swai or Tra.
[56:53.500 --> 56:59.500]  There's a fish that many of you have bought, Bassa. That's an imported catfish. It's a great product.
[56:59.500 --> 57:07.500]  The catfish industry saw this competition from tilapia and they saw it from the other catfish and they tried to ban it.
[57:07.500 --> 57:14.500]  There's a 400% tariff on the other catfish coming in from Vietnam because it competes with our industry.
[57:15.500 --> 57:22.500]  And it's a shame because instead of doing that kind of stuff, they should have just ramped up their efforts, the catfish industry.
[57:22.500 --> 57:29.500]  But most of you remember 20 years ago, that's all we had was catfish. And now it's hard to find a catfish.
[57:30.500 --> 57:39.500]  When I came to Santa Fe six years ago, I went to every store here and took pictures of product form of tilapia, just tilapia.
[57:39.500 --> 57:49.500]  I took pictures of frozen tilapia, panko crusted tilapia, all the convenient packaging. That's what the catfish industry should have done.
[57:49.500 --> 57:57.500]  In Santa Fe alone, I had 60 different products of tilapia. There were four products of catfish.
[57:58.500 --> 58:04.500]  Again, a very big advocate for tilapia, although they can be an invasive species.
[58:04.500 --> 58:11.500]  The other primary rule of thumb of what fish you're going to grow is, is it legal in your state?
[58:12.500 --> 58:22.500]  Make sure you look for all that. Even within California, there are regions where tilapia is allowed, but it's not the commercial viable species of tilapia.
[58:22.500 --> 58:32.500]  It's a slower grower tilapia with a smaller for lay percentage. You're looking for even at the species level, what's legal. Make sure you do that.
[58:37.500 --> 58:38.500]  Go ahead.
[58:38.500 --> 58:47.500]  Real question on that. For people that are thinking about possibly getting into this, obviously some want to get into farming cannabis, some want to possibly get into this.
[58:48.500 --> 59:00.500]  How much money would it take to potentially get that? You have the tent behind you, all of those things. I don't think people realize when they first get into farming cannabis, even at a smaller scale in a tent, all of those things add up pretty quick where you've spent thousands of dollars.
[59:00.500 --> 59:09.500]  In the early days, that might be $10,000 to get everything. Is it that same structure? Is this a significant investment to start out?
[59:09.500 --> 59:23.500]  Yeah, that's an honest and a great question. A lot of people start out with the IBC. I don't have an ability to share what an IBC tank is, but I'm sure most of you know what it is. It's the cube tank. It's a squared cube tank.
[59:23.500 --> 59:24.500]  Plastic totes.
[59:24.500 --> 59:25.500]  Plastic totes.
[59:25.500 --> 59:26.500]  With metal.
[59:27.500 --> 59:40.500]  Trucks everywhere. We repurpose those often if they're not used for some toxic chemical or you can buy them new as food grade. We can chop the top 25% off and flip it. Now you have a fish tank below and you have a grow bed up here.
[59:41.500 --> 59:56.500]  We'll have to fill it with some media. If I went with hydroton, that's $300 easily of hydroton alone. This is what Brian's talking about. We're starting to invest now. You got $150 in your IBC tank, $300 in media there.
[59:57.500 --> 01:00:18.500]  Instead, look for another media maybe. I always suggest going out to your local landscape company and looking for an appropriate media at a low cost. In Kentucky, I advocated for expanded shale. It's lightweight. It's perfect for systems like that. It was just cents on the cubic foot. It was so cheap. That's what every grower used.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:40.500]  I don't have that here. I would go to my local landscape yard. You all could look up this idea of the vinegar test for your media. Go to the landscape yard with a little cup of vinegar or a bottle of vinegar. When you find that cheap media that has all the characteristics that you think you want as a media, put it in a cup and pour some vinegar over it.
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:58.500]  If it bubbles and boils, it's releasing carbonates and it's jacking your pH up. If you use that for your media and your system, you'd be fighting high pH your entire grow. A quick test, it's called the vinegar test. You can find that on YouTube as well. You can see growers doing that.
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:22.500]  Now we're at 300, 400. Maybe you can find an alternative media. If you're doing this inside, now you've got grow lights to think about. If you have to conceal it for your state or wherever you are. I like sometimes to grow in a tent. I work completely rec legal here in New Mexico. I was med legal before that. I like to grow in a tent a lot because I can control my conditions.
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:42.500]  Most of what I do is an outdoor hoop house. I teach greenhouse management as well. A lot of what you're seeing is an outdoor crop. I use tents for my drying and curing. I can put relative humidity and temperature. I can dial it in. I've got one of those Bluetooth devices and check my parameters and open it up if I want and such.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:02:08.500]  Anyway, we're starting to add up indoors grow lights. I don't think you can get by much cheaper. What I also say is running a small system. You may think, well, I'll just get a 10 gallon aquarium like Charlie said. Get a goldfish, try aquaponics. That small aquarium is harder to manage than my 29,000 gallon UVI system once it's established.
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:25.500]  My big system has a buffer capacity. There's a lot of resiliency there in 29,000 gallons of water. PH does not fluctuate much. It takes a lot to move the temperature of that water. A little 10 gallon tank, very hard to manage.
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:46.500]  My recommendation there was to start with an aquarium and get some goldfish. Don't worry about aquaponics right now. Just prove to yourself that you can keep that aquarium. Understand that when the nitrates get real high, you need to do a dilution. Maybe you'll get the courage up. Instead of a dilution, let me just put in a little pump and try some NFT gutters over this thing.
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:03:06.500]  Those little systems are harder to manage than stepping up to an IBC tank like we're talking about. Maybe 500 bucks is a real investment to get yourself started. The IBC tanks, again, if you can visualize it, you would not believe the production out of a small system like that.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:30.500]  What we try to do, and I think I mentioned a little bit, is we're trying to balance these systems. The fish feed that goes in takes care of the plant need, and the plant area filters for the fish needs. We try to find a feeding rate ratio. How much do you put in this tank to support that grow bed without the water quality going bad and without nutrient deficiencies?
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:50.500]  A rule of thumb for everybody, if you buy an IBC setup or you build one and you have your clay balls or some media, I start with 12 grams a day. I feed six grams in the morning to my fish, six grams in the evening, and that can support a prolific four by four bed.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:04:18.500]  I have planted that four by four bed in beets before where I don't focus on the beet production and eating that root, that specialized root. I eat the beet greens. The entire four by four area planted with beet greens and every seven to 10 days going in there and picking all the big greens, which were selling at $8 and $9 a pound when I was a commercial grower, these were perfect beet greens.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:39.500]  Everybody here knows how healthy beets are. You cannot go to the supermarket and buy clean, healthy greens. I'm sorry again, soil advocates, but every beets that I buy is covered in dirt and the leaves are all buggy. They're whole. They're not healthy anymore because they only focus on selling me this root.
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:05:00.500]  I have the cleanest beet greens. My blood counts are off the charts. I have competitions with my wife about how healthy our blood levels are. This is me eating aquaponic food for 30 years. I don't buy a lot of produce. I produce all of my produce basically throughout the year for 30 years of my life.
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.500]  I'll pause there. Anybody have a comment?
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:09.500]  Oh man, once again, that was a beautiful rant, dude.
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.500]  Can I get onto this one point that I meant to come back to?
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.500]  Yes, go.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:30.500]  Okay. The naysayers. I had a student recently give a presentation we call Current Events, What's Happening. We're seeing a resurgence in Singapore. It was already kind of the garden city and there's a lot of green spaces in Singapore.
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:45.500]  The student found out that they're really moving in quite a bit into aquaponics. I took that chance to teach my students about a conference in 2005, quite a while ago, 2005 in Singapore.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:59.500]  I went, the godfather Jim Ricosi went, who we call the Yoda of aquaponics. This guy runs Canada, is Nick Savidoff. All three of us were there. We were the experts in the field.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:09.500]  We gave talks and talks and talks. I think I gave two talks because I was the grunt that did all the work and Jim Ricosi let me do a couple presentations.
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:15.500]  Jim Ricosi did the whole overview. Here's the UVI system. Nick Savidoff talked about his work.
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:21.500]  Nick Savidoff, again, everybody, we can put the correct spelling of some of these gurus down in a minute.
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:34.500]  He's the guru in Canada. He adopted the UVI system in 1998. They contracted us. We went up and built a replica of the UVI system in Lethbridge, Canada.
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:43.500]  Not Northern Canada, but north of Montana. Very, very cold region. I ended up later in my career working in Lethbridge.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:55.500]  In 1998, we built a replica there. Nick Savidoff discovered aquaponics. He had already done 25 years of plant physiology in hydroponics.
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:04.500]  He knew what he was doing. He did hydroponic trials and compared it to aquaponic trials. He did it for year one, year two, year three.
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:15.500]  We presented all this information, groundbreaking information at a hydroponic conference. We also knew that we were a threat to this industry.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:25.500]  All of our talks that we were talking, I literally said, you know, out there in the trade show, all those bottles of nutrients, you don't have to support those companies.
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:36.500]  You don't have to buy nutrients. That was a shock to the industry. We also saw aquaponics as the key to organic solutions.
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:44.500]  Being consistent every day with your fish feed input, you have a consistent nutrient solution every day that could be certified organic.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:51.500]  They had no options for organics at this conference. We did all this research. We showed them the statistics.
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:08:00.500]  We showed them the photos. We showed them all the data. Literally, the head of the committee, it was 300 scientists.
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:08.500]  They were all hydroponic gurus from around the world. The lead stood up in the crowd to our panel, myself, Riccosi, and Savidoff.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:17.500]  He says, we see your work. We see all of your results. We see all of your statistics. We see the photos and we see the graphs and the conclusions.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:25.500]  But we have come together as a consensus in 2005 to say, we don't believe you. Thank you for somebody putting the name in.
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:37.500]  So we don't believe you. They did not believe the results that they were seeing, that we could recycle 99% of our water every day and not do nutrient solution changes.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:43.500]  We do not dump our water periodically on the monthly. We don't do what hydroponic growers do.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:53.500]  We were saying, don't buy fertilizer. We recycle water. My data was showing commercial yields of tomatoes at 0.4 EC. Unheard of.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:09:02.500]  That guy said they don't believe us. Nick Savidoff responded appropriately. He says, there's my data. There's my statistics and my colleagues.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:15.500]  Now it's your job to disprove us. And they can't. So since 2005, hydroponic growers cannot disprove what's been published with aquaponics.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:24.500]  Published papers from people like Wilson Leonard that say that we can outcompete conventional hydroponics using aquaponics.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:37.500]  Many crops he trialed. Same good as or better as or the same results. So statistically better results using aquaponics systems.
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:46.500]  And what Nick Savidoff did with that UVI system, in year one, he did a comparison. And hydroponics won. And that's what we thought.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:54.500]  How can you beat hydroponics on tomatoes and cucumbers? We're dialing in 5.8 pH, a perfect nutrient recipe, perfect environmental conditions,
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:10:00.500]  and the yields were comparable with commercial growers in the Canadian region.
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:08.500]  Instead, aquaponics lost. That's what we thought. But Nick Savidoff carried this on to year two.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:14.500]  And in year two, he proved that aquaponics outcompeted. And in year three, it did more.
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:21.500]  And it showed the maturity of these systems with their microbial ecosystems becoming more productive,
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:28.500]  creates more robust systems that not only are more productive, but they're healthier. They're probiotics.
[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:35.500]  I've run systems, outdoor systems in the Caribbean, very close to hydroponic outdoor systems,
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:39.500]  where the hydroponic systems get every pathogen you can think of.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:48.500]  The aquaponics systems seem to have a probiotic resistance to a lot of diseases, especially over time as they become more resilient.
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:54.500]  So I just wanted to say that since that time, the hydroponic growers are now flocking to aquaponics.
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:59.500]  Look, we have podcasts now. Before, they didn't know what to do with us.
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:07.500]  In the early days when Jim Ricossi, Don Bailey, other researchers down there at UVI, we call it a team, the UVI team.
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:14.500]  There's a lot of people involved. When I used to do published research and I'd go to the conferences to talk about aquaponics,
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:20.500]  they didn't know where to put me. Okay, so one of the conferences we go to is Aquaculture America.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:24.500]  It's coming up in February in New Orleans, great place.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:32.500]  WAS.org is how we can find more information about Aquaculture America. I'll be there, some of my students.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:38.500]  But when I used to go in late 1990s, early 2000s, they wouldn't know where to put us.
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:42.500]  They would put me into recirculating aquaculture with all the tank guys.
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:49.500]  And I'm over here talking about effluent use. What do we do with manure? What do we do with the effluent?
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:55.500]  How can we monetize it? Nobody cared. Nobody was in the rooms at that time.
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:02.500]  Sometimes they would find a waste treatment kind of session, but really there'd be nobody in there.
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:09.500]  Nobody was interested. Finally, they would start to see that there was an audience.
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:14.500]  People were starting to come in and there'd be some weird session and then there'd be me stuck in there.
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:19.500]  And as soon as my talk was announced, the whole room would fill and the crowd would be in the hallway
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:24.500]  complaining that they couldn't get in. So then they created entire sessions on aquaponics.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.500]  And now we have entire two day sessions at these conferences.
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:34.500]  And they've often had me and other gurus come in and do advanced workshops pre-conference
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:38.500]  because grad students and everybody wants to know how to do aquaponics.
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.500]  It's pretty fascinating how it's taken off.
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:50.500]  Related to that as well, since we have plenty of time to keep talking, aquaponics really took off in regions
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.500]  where there was limited water and land. So the Caribbean and around St. Croix.
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:00.500]  Australia was another kind of a hot spot as this picked up for the same reason.
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:05.500]  But Europe really didn't jump into aquaponics as soon as places like North America.
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:11.500]  North America, probably because we pioneered all this in the U.S. Virgin Islands,
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:15.500]  so a lot of our information got out to U.S. growers.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.500]  And so North America really pioneered aquaponics.
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:25.500]  There was a lot going on in Canada as well, even before Nick Savidov and I, myself, really got involved.
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:31.500]  This was in the early days, again, from fish farmers wanting to know how do you clean up fish waste?
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:37.500]  So the Europeans fell behind. But there were researchers in every country in Europe
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.500]  that were interested in aquaponics.
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:46.500]  They would come to some of these international conferences where I met Leighton in 2009 or 2010.
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:50.500]  They'd find these were international conferences. That's where we would network.
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.500]  We started to realize they weren't up to speed.
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:14:00.500]  So we encouraged the European, and they did it on their own accord, to get together as a group.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.500]  Researchers focused on aquaponics across the EU.
[01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:10.500]  They got funding to create a collaboration for meetings that they could all get together.
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.500]  And they brought gurus in from around the world.
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:18.500]  Some of the names I've mentioned, Wilson Leonard, Nick Savidov, myself, Jim Ricossi.
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:23.500]  Other names that you may hear about, Ryan Chatterson, Janelle Hager.
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:31.500]  So we were all involved going at different times and sitting down with every researcher in the EU in one location and training them.
[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:38.500]  I taught them about the UVI system. I taught them about the Kentucky State systems, the organic movement that was happening.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:43.500]  So what they did is they developed a research consortium, and they have a great network.
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:49.500]  It's called the Cost Action Network, the EU Aquaponics Hub.
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.500]  And you can find all that on YouTube.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:57.500]  Their channel on YouTube, I think, has something like 70 hours of lectures
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:06.500]  from microbial identification to fish health, to natural biological pest control for aquaponics systems, on and on and on.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:11.500]  Those researchers have now helped each other learn those specific areas.
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:18.500]  And so as a result, they put out a book that came out a few years ago that is kind of the new textbook for a lot of people.
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:24.500]  And it's also open source. It's called Aquaponics Food Production Systems.
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:33.500]  And if you search for that in PDF, you'll find a book from Springer, and it's written by a bunch of European researchers.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:38.500]  I don't validate everything in there, but it's an incredible book and resource for you.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:48.500]  I think what they do is they, as they learned about the aquaponics, they kind of went into what we call decoupled aquaponics, where we split the systems.
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:56.500]  And we're going to have some time here to talk about that, because it is a very good system for cannabis growers, if that's some of your interest.
[01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:01.500]  Separating the fish from the plants, not having this delicate balance anymore.
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.500]  Basically using fish waste to feed plants over in a separate system.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:17.500]  You may do that for a lot of reasons, but one reason is we may be able to take the fish waste and tailor and amend the nutrients to tailor it to that crop of desire.
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:26.500]  If it's cannabis, maybe we want to put some K and some P in there during flowering and fruiting that may be a little deficient in your coupled system.
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:33.500]  So the European book that I just mentioned, great resource, but I think it skips some of the foundation.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:40.500]  I think some of those researchers may not have been around for 20 years to see the beauty of a coupled system.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:45.500]  The coupled system is all about a symbiotic microbial relationship.
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:49.500]  And when we start to decouple systems, we lose that.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.500]  It's not a 99% recycled system anymore.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:59.500]  It's a flow through. You're flowing through your fish tank, through your plants and out the back door in some of these systems.
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.500]  So we've lost what really aquaponics is.
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:08.500]  And it's to the point now that when we get together in conferences, we have plenary sessions.
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.500]  And the topic is, what is aquaponics?
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:15.500]  And it's just like many of you in your sessions. What is soil?
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:17.500]  I have that conversation a lot.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:23.500]  I was on a USDA task force for organic hydroponics and aquaponics.
[01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:28.500]  They were eight soil, pro soil people and eight pro hydro people.
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:32.500]  And we had to come to a consensus. What is soil?
[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.500]  So definitions are very, very important.
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:44.500]  Right now with aquaponic industry growing, we need a validated definition so we can apply for grants.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:49.500]  So the federal government recognizes what is aquaponics.
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.500]  So we have these long definition battles.
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.500]  We are fairly congenial about it.
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:18:02.500]  But some people want to let everybody fit the mold, be inclusive of every little system.
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.500]  A decoupled system, for instance.
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:06.500]  Or I'll give you an example in a minute.
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.500]  And some people say it needs to be closed loop.
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.500]  It needs to be a 99% recycle system.
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:18.500]  That's what aquaponics is, where the fish take care of the plants and the plants take care of the fish.
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:25.500]  Not a system where you take some fish waste and add some macro thrive,
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:29.500]  some kind of crazy nutrient that you buy off the store and feed your system.
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:33.500]  So here's the reason I think I like the idea of we need a definition.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:37.500]  It's because I don't want people to bastardize the word aquaponics.
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:44.500]  I think true growers who are in many of your cases, y'all are putting the efforts into living soil.
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:46.500]  That's an effort. That is a lot of work.
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:51.500]  You prepare years ahead of time to make sure you're set at the right time.
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.500]  Aquaponics can be challenging as well.
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:59.500]  So here's the case where somebody in Brian's hood has got an indoor grow.
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:01.500]  They're doing cannabis.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.500]  They're doing cannabis, small plants and NFT gutters.
[01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:09.500]  So they have a 500-gallon reservoir, nutrient salts in there.
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.500]  They're buying advanced nutrients.
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:14.500]  Sorry, advanced nutrients is watching.
[01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.500]  But they're buying some chemical nutrient off the shelf.
[01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.500]  And they're managing the perfect pH, the perfect EC.
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.500]  They got great little plants cycling through very effectively.
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:28.500]  That's hydroponics in my opinion, traditional hydroponics.
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:32.500]  If that grower throws three goldfish in that nutrient tank,
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.500]  they can call it now the aquaponic chronic.
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.500]  They can brand it as aquaponics.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:45.500]  Because a lot of people's definition is fish plus plants and a recirculating hydroponic systems.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.500]  And that's it.
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:51.500]  So now this guy's got fish and plants and a recirculating hydroponic system.
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.500]  It fits the definition of aquaponics.
[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:58.500]  So we start to figure out how can we brand it a little better.
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:02.500]  And so we start focusing on where do the nutrients come from.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:06.500]  That's what distinguishes aquaponics from hydroponics.
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:11.500]  So in a classic system like a UVI system that's been studied,
[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:13.500]  replicated around the world,
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:17.500]  at least 80% of our nutrients come from fish waste.
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.500]  So maybe we classify it as a number like that.
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.500]  But as we dig into this and try to be specific,
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:28.500]  it's still not going to stop that one guy from calling it aquaponic chronic.
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:32.500]  So I, being a purist, think it's important.
[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:34.500]  Other people don't think it's so important.
[01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:38.500]  We shouldn't have this battle and just let everybody call it what it is.
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.500]  The idea of decoupling a system.
[01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.500]  Let's go ahead and talk about that for a minute.
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:47.500]  It's the opposite of a balanced system where the fish and the plants
[01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:51.500]  are in a harmonious relationship. Total opposite.
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:55.500]  It's a fish system. That's what I call aquaculture.
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:00.500]  That's what I went to master's degree and bachelor degree to study was aquaculture.
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:02.500]  That's a fish system.
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:07.500]  Over here is a hydroponic system where we tailor our nutrients to our plants.
[01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:09.500]  We manage the pH.
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.500]  We control irrigation cycles just for the plants.
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:13.500]  They're two separate systems.
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:18.500]  So I mentioned one reason earlier why we may want to decouple a system.
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.500]  It's because you have a high value plant and you want to optimize it.
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:25.500]  So it makes sense to split it up.
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:27.500]  That's okay.
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:31.500]  But some people are starting to say, is that aquaponics?
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:37.500]  You're over here putting maybe 50% fish waste and 50% cow mag,
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:41.500]  50% chelated iron, throwing other nutrients in there.
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:43.500]  So is that aquaponics anymore?
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:47.500]  Or is that just hydroponics amended with fish water?
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.500]  They're going to capitalize on the name.
[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:55.500]  Another reason we may want to decouple a system like that is for food safety.
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:59.500]  And in the commercial world right now, this is kind of rearing its head.
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.500]  Is aquaponics even food safe?
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:06.500]  Are we going to get sick eating that lettuce or those cucumbers?
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.500]  Or handling the weed or medicinal weed?
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:10.500]  Is it safe?
[01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:15.500]  The microbials is probably a big issue if you're into medicinal weed and selling it to the market.
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.500]  This is an organic environment.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:20.500]  It's a humid environment.
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:26.500]  And I know some people are using foliar ferments and microbes.
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:32.500]  So you guys know how to control microbes and cannabis better than I do as far as selling it.
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.500]  But this is an environment that we need to think about.
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:36.500]  Is it food safe?
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:41.500]  There's been studies out there that have not shown food safety issues,
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:46.500]  except for workers and sanitary issues, worker hygiene issues.
[01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:49.500]  That's where food safety problems come from typically.
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:53.500]  Post-harvest handling, potentially contaminated seeds even,
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:57.500]  and other contaminated media can bring pathogens in your system as well.
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:02.500]  But we're not seeing the systems being conducive to pathogens.
[01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.500]  Fish are cold-blooded animals.
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:09.500]  So they do not harbor E. coli, the pathogenic E. colis.
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:14.500]  There's been studies where we inoculate aquaponics systems with E. coli.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.500]  And we can plate it and then we can see it just drop out, drop out, drop out.
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:23.500]  There's no warm mammalian blood for an organism like that to thrive.
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.500]  Same thing with salmonella and listeria.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:29.500]  We've seen work done plating it and dropping out of these systems.
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:31.500]  They're not conducive.
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.500]  So because the fish are cold-blooded animals,
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:41.500]  technically their waste is not considered manure by USDA.
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:45.500]  And these are some of the issues that have come up over the couple decades
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:49.500]  that I've been in here, is trying to deal with USDA and aquaponics
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:51.500]  and food safety and these kinds of things.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:56.500]  So the questions came up, can we use fish effluent without composting it?
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:00.500]  We can't use manures from cows without composting it,
[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:01.500]  and chickens and rabbits.
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.500]  For one thing, it's very hot, those other manures,
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.500]  but they also contain pathogens that can affect humans.
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:11.500]  So USDA requires you, especially in organic standards,
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:13.500]  to compost that manure.
[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:15.500]  And I'm over here trying to grow plants.
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:19.500]  I'm trying to get USDA certified and I don't compost my manure.
[01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:23.500]  So I was trained as a paralegal.
[01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.500]  If you can imagine, I was actually in the DC Air National Guard
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.500]  back in the day, Bush War I.
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:33.500]  I spent four years of my life writing wills and powers of attorneys
[01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:37.500]  for other soldiers going to that first war over in the Gulf.
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:42.500]  But, boy, I really lost train of thought.
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.500]  No, that was good.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:47.500]  Yeah, I was a paralegal.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.500]  So I understand the letter of the law.
[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.500]  I understand how to find the law and follow the law.
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.500]  I recommend all my growers to follow the law.
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.500]  So I looked in the USDA standards.
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:24:59.500]  What is manure?
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:01.500]  Manure comes from livestock.
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:03.500]  Okay, what is livestock?
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:07.500]  Livestock is blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank.
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:09.500]  And they don't mention fish.
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.500]  They say cow and pig and goat and sheep and all this stuff,
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:14.500]  but there's no fish.
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:18.500]  So to USDA, fish is not considered livestock.
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:22.500]  So fish, manure comes from livestock.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.500]  So what the fish shit is not manure.
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.500]  Don't say manure, right?
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:29.500]  You got your partner says fish brew.
[01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.500]  It's not fish manure.
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:34.500]  If you say manure, you start to get regulated.
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:36.500]  I say fish effluent.
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:38.500]  I avoid the word manure as well.
[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:40.500]  It's fish effluent.
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:44.500]  If you, again, look at what manure is, and it is regulated.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:48.500]  So maybe steer clear of that if you're working with fish shit and fish brew.
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.500]  So these systems are not regulated.
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:53.500]  So you can be safe.
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.500]  But you still have to adhere to food safety standards.
[01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.500]  You still have to, in some cases, be certified.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:01.500]  That depends on your market.
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:03.500]  Do you need GAP certification?
[01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:07.500]  Do you need your other food safety for your state?
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:12.500]  We have a program here that buys food for our schools and senior citizen centers.
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:19.500]  And that's an amazing program to get your healthy aquaponic food to the people who need it.
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:24.500]  And then you just circumvent delivering to restaurants and get into these state programs
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:29.500]  where you're guaranteed to sell by the pound all of your greens, all of your food.
[01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:32.500]  And again, it's getting into the community that needs it.
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:37.500]  School children, elderly people, they may not be able to afford it.
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:42.500]  And so the most healthy food in Santa Fe right now goes to the people in need.
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:44.500]  It's awesome.
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:46.500]  And we have an amazing restaurant community here.
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:51.500]  But the entrepreneurs here that I have spun off, they say working with restauranteurs is miserable.
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:54.500]  And you're selling five pounds here and seven pounds here.
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:56.500]  And it's a hustle.
[01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:00.500]  And you're driving through little alleys of crowded downtowns, running out and delivering.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:05.500]  Instead, you work with these systems that are in place now that are advocating for local food.
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:07.500]  And you have direct sales.
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:09.500]  They come and pick up.
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.500]  Instead, my grower built cold storage at his facility.
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.500]  And they come pick up the food every Tuesday.
[01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.500]  All he does is stay on schedule.
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.500]  So lots of ways that we can do that.
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:27.500]  But to get into that system, he had to follow New Mexico-grown rules and regulations.
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:30.500]  You got to wear your gloves, your hair nets.
[01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:32.500]  You got to have sign-ins.
[01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:34.500]  You got to have all those things in place.
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:40.500]  And so if you do not intend to do those things, don't get into food or cannabis as a business.
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.500]  It's heavily regulated.
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:46.500]  People are eating this and we have to ensure food safety.
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:48.500]  So they're putting it all on the farmers now.
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:54.500]  The Food Safety Modernization Act is designed to prevent the illnesses, not respond to them.
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:56.500]  And it's all on the farmers.
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:02.500]  Especially as you start to increase your income, more and more of that is on you.
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.500]  And you're putting a lot of expenses into making sure things are safe.
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:08.500]  And you should all be familiar with things like audits.
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.500]  And some of these programs will have mock audits.
[01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.500]  Well, they'll bring an inspector in and sit down with you.
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:18.500]  And they'll say, OK, somebody at Pasquale's restaurant got sick.
[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:20.500]  And we showed that you sold lettuce.
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:22.500]  It was tracked.
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:24.500]  You have lettuce in the cooler.
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:28.500]  So show me the tracking system you have in place to prove that it wasn't your food.
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:34.500]  OK, well, I also sold to Joe's Diner, Cafe Santa Fe, blah, blah, blah.
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.500]  Let's go back and see if people are getting sick there.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.500]  No reports there.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.500]  So that's probably good enough.
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:41.500]  That is not traced back to me.
[01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.500]  But all that has to be in place as you get into commercial aquaponics.
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:58.500]  Most of my career, I have tried to pass this knowledge to commercial growers, not backyard growers, not bathtub growers, and not closet growers.
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.500]  But obviously, that kind of people come to podcasts like this.
[01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:05.500]  Ninety-nine percent of you are not going to be commercial growers.
[01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.500]  But that's what I focus on.
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.500]  So let me tell you where I am currently.
[01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:13.500]  I've got some other history that we may get to.
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:18.500]  But in 2016, I landed in Santa Fe.
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:28.500]  Santa Fe had a program in greenhouse management started again by Eric Highfield, a former interviewee, I guess, on the program here.
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:36.500]  And it was focused on water-based farming and recycle systems, predominantly, specifically, hydroponics and aquaponics.
[01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:44.500]  One of the first schools in the nation that really honed in on that is a specific grow technique for water conservative methods.
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.500]  We are a community college.
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:53.500]  So we offer two-year associate degrees or we offer a one-year certificate.
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:30:03.500]  During COVID, I did switch to online and we had a couple cohorts go through and get degrees from Puerto Rico to Maine, all over the U.S.
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.500]  People and even international tried to get in.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.500]  But after COVID, I stopped.
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:13.500]  I threw away my online curriculum and said, it's just impossible.
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:15.500]  It's not impossible because I did it.
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.500]  And we are going to rebuild it.
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:28.500]  But it's very hard to teach someone to be the workforce of the future without ever seeing them touch a seed, care and nurture for a plant through it, excuse me, through its life cycle.
[01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:31.500]  I don't even like the idea of these one week.
[01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:40.500]  You can take all my classes online and you come to Santa Fe for one week or you connect with maybe I'll make a relationship with Brian who has a commercial greenhouse.
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:44.500]  And we can say, well, if you're in Colorado, you can go to Brian's greenhouse.
[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:49.500]  If you're in California, Layton has a facility that's certified and you can do your skills there.
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:52.500]  But one week, no way.
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.500]  I am not going to be giving a lot of degrees for somebody who comes in here for a week.
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:58.500]  You've got to go through the cycles.
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:08.500]  Even I like in the greenhouse management, I like my students to be involved in the three weeks where you tear down a greenhouse, where you sterilize everything and then you put it all back together.
[01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.500]  Not just the fun part of picking tomatoes.
[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:15.500]  So we want to be very comprehensive with all that.
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:18.500]  My program.
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.500]  So, again, there's people that audit my classes.
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:23.500]  There's people that aren't interested in a degree.
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:33.500]  I have people already with bachelor degrees in my class, students with master's degrees in my classes, and I've had students with PhDs in my classes.
[01:31:34.500 --> 01:31:35.500]  And I'm a community college.
[01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:41.500]  What I found is the community college allows for public private partnerships.
[01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:44.500]  This is why Layton has come around to our campus.
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.500]  Potential business connections.
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:48.500]  And we focus on sustainability.
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:54.500]  And that's why somebody like Layton finds us and the State Department finds us and other organizations find us.
[01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.500]  And I am currently the academic director of the program.
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:59.500]  And so I am the lead.
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:02.500]  And I would love to talk to anybody who's listening here.
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:04.500]  We need support.
[01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:06.500]  We can provide help.
[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:10.500]  So there's a lot of ways that we can form relationships and build bigger, stronger communities.
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:15.500]  So please look me up if you if you're watching this and you are in the ability to help.
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.500]  My job is to help other growers.
[01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:24.500]  I was at a conference recently and I talked to a farmer who was giving some presentations out of South Africa.
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:29.500]  And one of his missions is to spawn 10 other growers.
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:44.500]  And he knows that if he can spawn 10 growers who may also have that commitment to spawn 10 other growers and not just encourage and inspire somebody, but train them and hold their hand, build their soil with them.
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:47.500]  Build their aquaponic system with them, help them manage it.
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:57.500]  So if he does 10 and those other people start to do the same thing, then he's made a lot bigger impact than running a 10,000 head a week lettuce farm.
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:32:59.500]  He's not just a farmer doing the right thing.
[01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:01.500]  He's a teacher now doing the right thing.
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:03.500]  He's a farmer and a teacher.
[01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:07.500]  So if you all can do the same thing and kind of spread this, that's what I'm doing now as well.
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.500]  I'm trying to spawn other farmers.
[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:13.500]  In my community now we have two commercial facilities.
[01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:16.500]  One is in full operation and one is still under construction.
[01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:19.500]  One is an indoor facility.
[01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:24.500]  Indoor vertical, big horizontal racks stacked vertically three tiers high.
[01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:30.500]  Also big vertical round tubes that are circular with lights all around them.
[01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:35.500]  Media beds involved as well in an aquaponic system.
[01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:40.500]  Like Leighton said, staggered fish tanks where you have multiple fish tanks.
[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:44.500]  So when he harvests, we get constant feed input when we restock.
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:52.500]  So being very consistent and running in a, I think it's about a 3,000 square foot facility.
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:57.500]  He's running the equivalent of about two acres of production.
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:33:59.500]  Amazing amount of food.
[01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:02.500]  It kind of blew this paradigm away as well.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.500]  We live in a region where we have ample sunlight.
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:09.500]  We have the best sunlight in the nation, except for maybe Arizona.
[01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.500]  Okay, New Mexico is next.
[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:14.500]  We have free sunlight.
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:20.500]  And this grower went inside to test the economic potential of indoor farming.
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:26.500]  I'd be shocked if any of you could present me any valid research that says
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:30.500]  indoor vertical farming has proven to be economically viable.
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:37.500]  I have seen this year alone over a billion dollars invested in the US in indoor vertical farming.
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:41.500]  And I think it's before the economic jury has even settled it.
[01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:43.500]  I don't think we're there yet.
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:47.500]  I think people are throwing a lot of money at it and we're not there yet.
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:49.500]  I think we'll get there.
[01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:54.500]  Lighting, for instance, has had amazing developments in the last 10 years.
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:56.500]  You know, it was hardly 10 years ago.
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:58.500]  It was about 10 years ago that I did my master's work.
[01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:06.500]  When I did light comparisons, I did induction lighting, LED lighting, metal halides and fluorescents.
[01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:11.500]  LED at that time, just 10, 11 years ago, weren't even adjustable.
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:13.500]  I couldn't even change spectrums.
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:18.500]  I couldn't buy really lights that were designed specifically for grow.
[01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:20.500]  That was just coming on the market.
[01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:24.500]  And if anybody looks at scholar.google and finds my lighting,
[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:30.500]  you're going to see that basic light for a 2x4 space was like $1,700 back then.
[01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:32.500]  So now the price has come down.
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:34.500]  The intensity has gone up.
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:36.500]  The adjustability is there.
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:41.500]  So what we do now with our work with lighting is we focus on light recipes.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.500]  Right?
[01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:47.500]  This is the kind of research I like to get into with my students is we can change spectrums.
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:50.500]  We can change spectrums at different times of the grow cycle.
[01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:52.500]  Right?
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:58.500]  Like everybody knows with cannabis, the blue during the veg, the red, orange, kind of later in life.
[01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:02.500]  And we can change the lights now in an indoor facility.
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:05.500]  So our program used to be called greenhouse management.
[01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:12.500]  We're now called controlled environment agriculture because we do all these indoor grows, shipping container grows.
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:17.500]  And we're focused more on the entire environment, not just in a greenhouse.
[01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:22.500]  Students also take advantage of a very robust internship program.
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:31.500]  My greenhouse, I have not even mentioned this, but my state of the art, about 12,000 square foot greenhouse is off grid.
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:33.500]  We have energy storage there.
[01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:37.500]  We have solar panels primarily providing the energy.
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.500]  But we also have different energy assets that we're working with.
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:44.500]  From biofuels, we're installing a wind component right now.
[01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:50.500]  Where students can now look at different energy assets, how it economically impacts a greenhouse like this.
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:55.500]  But we also focus on communities, community projects.
[01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:01.500]  What we call our greenhouse is a micro grid that's embedded with our campus nano grid.
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:03.500]  Our campus is off grid.
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:09.500]  We are within that grid, but we're also made it so we are independent of that grid.
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:19.500]  What we focus on and the reason Layton found us is that we knew each other before, but the reason he visited us now is we're focused on food, energy and water.
[01:37:20.500 --> 01:37:25.500]  And if we can start thinking about micro communities, I think that's where the future lies.
[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:28.500]  Being sovereign is the way we describe it.
[01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:31.500]  We kind of threw out the word sustainable.
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:33.500]  Nobody knows what that means.
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:35.500]  It's hard to measure.
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:37.500]  We talk about sovereignties.
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:40.500]  And in my area, you can picture indigenous tribal communities.
[01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:42.500]  We have Pueblos all around us.
[01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:44.500]  They are isolated.
[01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:48.500]  COVID was a perfect example to witness that.
[01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.500]  As soon as COVID spread, they closed their gates.
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:53.500]  We couldn't get in.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:55.500]  They couldn't get out.
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:38:03.500]  We literally drove food from our greenhouse, our aquaponic food to Jemez Pueblo and handed it over the gate for the community.
[01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:07.500]  If you are not food sovereign, you will die.
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:10.500]  Some of us went through 9-11.
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:12.500]  Most of us probably.
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.500]  It took two days and the shelves were empty.
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:17.500]  There was no commerce.
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:19.500]  There was no flights.
[01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:21.500]  There was no shipping.
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:23.500]  And all of a sudden, there was no food.
[01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:25.500]  That stuff started to rebound.
[01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:27.500]  We've seen it during COVID.
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:30.500]  The supply chain gets impacted.
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:32.500]  So that's food.
[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:34.500]  What about energy?
[01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:42.500]  We can look at a tribal community or a campus or your community that you want to develop and talk about how energy sovereign are you.
[01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.500]  Do you create 80% of your energy?
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:48.500]  Do you create your energy on sunny days?
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.500]  Do you have a storage capacity?
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:53.500]  Are you 100% energy sovereign?
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:55.500]  That's great.
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:57.500]  What about your land?
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:38:59.500]  Are you land sovereign?
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:01.500]  Do you own your home?
[01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:02.500]  Does the Indian Pueblo, they're independent.
[01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:05.500]  They check that box, 100% land sovereign.
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:10.500]  So we put all the sovereignties together and we've got about four or five, including culture and such.
[01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:13.500]  We can start to put numbers on it.
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:15.500]  I'm 80% energy sovereign.
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:17.500]  I'm 100% food sovereign.
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.500]  I'm 20% land sovereign.
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:21.500]  Whatever you are.
[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:23.500]  And then we can kind of come up with a sovereignty number.
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:25.500]  And then we can start working on it.
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:27.500]  Oh, you're not really food sovereign?
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:29.500]  Let's focus on that.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.500]  We can start to tie in our water resources to develop food for our community.
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:38.500]  I remember last year in Texas when the grid went down, the cold snap went through Texas.
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.500]  I can almost, I hate to say it, it's going to happen again this year.
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:43.500]  That's my crystal ball.
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:49.500]  My crystal ball also says next week, just before Thanksgiving, we're going to have a food safety recall on lettuce.
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:51.500]  Mark my words.
[01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:56.500]  I'm sorry, this is live and this is going to be forever on the internet if I'm wrong.
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:58.500]  But it seems to be a trend.
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:02.500]  Things seem to, they're going to rear themselves for sure.
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:06.500]  You got me curious.
[01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:08.500]  Why are they going to have a recall on lettuce?
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:10.500]  Like E. coli?
[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:12.500]  Is that what you're getting at?
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:14.500]  Yeah, the food safety issues.
[01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:20.500]  Again, I mentioned before, any of these food safety issues typically come from your worker and your worker hygiene.
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:24.500]  I can also tell you, and you guys can look it up, you're very familiar.
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:28.500]  Almost all food safety scares start with organic food.
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:32.500]  The dirtiest food in the market is organic food.
[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:35.500]  It's the manures that weren't composted properly.
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:39.500]  Often in the soil, again, I'm not anti-soil.
[01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:47.500]  I teach my, we start our entire curriculum with the soil food web, with Elaine Ingham's work.
[01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:56.500]  Y'all should all be familiar with Teeming with Microbes, Teeming with Nutrients, Teeming with Fungi, the Jeff Lowenfeld's books.
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:58.500]  Those are my textbooks.
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:04.500]  My students have to understand that soil food web before they understand the aquatic food web.
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:06.500]  It's the same thing.
[01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:08.500]  It's nutrient cycling, remineralization.
[01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:10.500]  Brian, what was your comment again?
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:14.500]  I'm sorry, I got a little, what did you mention there?
[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:19.500]  He was asking about why was the lettuce going to, why was there going to be an outbreak of the vegetables?
[01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:24.500]  Again, typically it's an organic farm because we're not using manures properly.
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:29.500]  Our conventional farms, believe it or not, the workers there often use the restroom right in the field.
[01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:31.500]  They squat right in place.
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:33.500]  They don't wash their hands afterwards.
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.500]  They start spreading that on the lettuce and then it goes across the country.
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:45.500]  And then they have to recall everything because 85% of your winter lettuce comes from Yuma, Arizona or California in the off season.
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:47.500]  They just switch.
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:50.500]  So when there's an outbreak, it impacts the entire U.S.
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:42:00.500]  And so I've just seen the trend and I'm an advocate for CEA in local communities, controlled environment agriculture.
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:07.500]  I can also say to be a realist, there's a lot of people that say, well, you're in a greenhouse and it's controlled environment agriculture.
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:09.500]  There's no pathogens.
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:15.500]  We can find articles of late that talk about this trend where people think it's safe because we've protected it.
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:20.500]  We still have to adhere to every food safety protocol that's required for our market.
[01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:25.500]  We have less ability to have pathogens because we're controlling our environment.
[01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:28.500]  But if we don't adhere to those food safety standards, we will.
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.500]  So I think that we'll see that trend occur.
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:39.500]  We'll continue to see mega corporate farms that supply 80 to 90% of a certain commodity across the U.S.
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:43.500]  come down with food safety issues and impact the whole U.S.
[01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:53.500]  And so if we have small CEA facilities producing food or medicine in our communities, when the shit hits the fan, we have an outlet.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:55.500]  We have food for school children.
[01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:57.500]  We have food for senior citizens.
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:01.500]  And this is very important on a tribal network.
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:04.500]  They care for their senior citizens, their health.
[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:06.500]  They get the best of the best.
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:12.500]  I work with a lady hailing up Marion Naranjo of Santa Clara Pueblo.
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:19.500]  She and her network of people produce food there and it goes straight first to the senior citizen center.
[01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:25.500]  So when they started growing strawberries, it went there first and it never left.
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:28.500]  Those senior citizens gobbled that stuff up and they don't mind.
[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:30.500]  They're going to treat them. That's the elders.
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:32.500]  So that's very important.
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:34.500]  So with our program, food safety is important.
[01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:37.500]  Every student has to take a food safety class.
[01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:44.500]  Every student has to take a construction safety class, an OSHA 30 class, so you get OSHA 30 credentials.
[01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:53.500]  I mentioned the internship's very robust, whether you're on our state-of-the-art facility here on campus or I put you in industry.
[01:43:54.500 --> 01:44:01.500]  And now we have the indoor farm that's in production and the greenhouse farm that's in production.
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:05.500]  And that's in development right now is taking advantage of natural sunlight.
[01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:13.500]  So another aquaponic facility combining multiple fish tanks with deep water culture for vegetable production primarily.
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:16.500]  This farm is called Lettuce Etc.
[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:18.500]  They're just launching their websites.
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.500]  What they've done is a unique marketing strategy.
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:24.500]  So we've all got to think about when you're growing something.
[01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:28.500]  I can teach you to grow fish and plants and cannabis.
[01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:33.500]  Layton can teach you to grow cannabis and Brian can teach you how to grow cannabis in a living soil.
[01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:35.500]  We can teach you how to do it.
[01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:37.500]  Can you make money at it?
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:39.500]  That's on you.
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:46.500]  The marketing, the business strategy, whether it's aquaponic lettuce or aquaponic chronic, you've really got to put that together.
[01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:49.500]  So the business is on you developing it.
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:52.500]  We have a couple local businesses now.
[01:44:53.500 --> 01:44:55.500]  One of them is doing this unique marketing.
[01:44:55.500 --> 01:45:01.500]  I let him use my systems, my commercial scale systems at school for his internship.
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:03.500]  And he did a marketing study.
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.500]  And the marketing study was about home delivery of lettuce.
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:11.500]  Kind of like the milkman back in the day.
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:13.500]  Everybody wanted fresh milk.
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:18.500]  And now we just go to the grocery store and buy everything in one place.
[01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:21.500]  I have a picture on my phone right now.
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:23.500]  I went to a supermarket here in Santa Fe.
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:24.500]  The cheapest supermarket.
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:26.500]  Our Mexican grocery store.
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:29.500]  Nothing organic in there whatsoever.
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:36.500]  The heads of romaine lettuce and leaf lettuce like you see in your store with the twisty tie on it, kind of brown.
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:38.500]  $5.48.
[01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:43.500]  Now that shocked me because I haven't bought lettuce in 30 years.
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:46.500]  And I'm used to that product being $1.99.
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:52.500]  So I don't know if it's just been inflation since the last president took over or whatever.
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:56.500]  But I was dramatically shocked to see the price of lettuce.
[01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:59.500]  My production cost didn't go up that much.
[01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:01.500]  So there's a good market for lettuce.
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:03.500]  There's also a good market for cannabis.
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:05.500]  But you've got to market it.
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:07.500]  You've got to do all that business.
[01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:09.500]  So this guy is looking at home delivery.
[01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:16.500]  And so he did a market study where he got people to participate for free lettuce just to answer some surveys.
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.500]  And he got a lot of valuable data back from the surveys.
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:21.500]  And he also built a network.
[01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:24.500]  250 households participated.
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:26.500]  He was giving free lettuce.
[01:46:27.500 --> 01:46:32.500]  So now he set up a network where every day of the week he services 25 households.
[01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:43.500]  He goes in an electric car, drops insulated bags with a little chill pack in it and a sanitary wipe on it at the doorstep in the shade and on schedule.
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:48.500]  And he comes back 14 days later with your next drop and he picks up the bag.
[01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:53.500]  So with his network now, he's done that for one day of the week every day.
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:57.500]  And he's got a huge network and he looks like the economics look well.
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:01.500]  If that succeeds, he's going to kind of replicate that in different areas.
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:03.500]  You've got to be creative.
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:07.500]  I think aquaponic chronic in some areas is an untapped market.
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:12.500]  New Mexico just legalized this April on 420.
[01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:16.500]  And I tell my students, you've got to have a niche.
[01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:18.500]  The big boys are already here.
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:20.500]  They're cutthroat.
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:23.500]  They're going to buy up the small businesses right away.
[01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:26.500]  They don't want anything to do with aquaponics.
[01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:32.500]  Aquaponics seems to have a scale ability, a sweet spot of maybe where you fit in the market.
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:35.500]  There's some nice examples out there in the industry.
[01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:38.500]  But I think here in New Mexico, the time is prime.
[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:40.500]  Nobody's doing it.
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:43.500]  My students are the best trained in the world.
[01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:47.500]  So somebody could step out and do that and step into the market.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:49.500]  Otherwise, I think it's hard.
[01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:55.500]  We have cannabis grows here that are using living soil, that are calling their product organic.
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:48:02.500]  Or the pet peeve for me, I walked in to discuss things and he said they were 1000 times organic.
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:05.500]  I was like, dude, you just blew your whole reputation with me.
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:09.500]  One, because we don't have federal organic certification of cannabis anyway.
[01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:12.500]  And how can you be a thousand times organic?
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:19.500]  You're just throwing keywords out there and some people are going to call you on what you do.
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:33.500]  My students, again, that internship has really provided valuable experience because there's few places in the world that you can get an internship on an aquaponic farm.
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.500]  It used to be back in the day, early in the industry.
[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:44.500]  I, as a growing student and a practitioner, I could go find a farmer and say, you know, I'd love to internship on your farm.
[01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:47.500]  Will you take me in? And he says, sure, you know, come on in.
[01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:53.500]  I'll even give you a place to stay and you can eat dinner with the family every night or something like the Wolfers do.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:49:03.500]  Now, to find a good aquaponic farm, Oroboros, for instance, down in Half Moon Bay, California, he'll take you in as an intern.
[01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:06.500]  But you have to pay him and you have to put yourself up.
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:11.500]  So you're now you're paying for that opportunity to be a volunteer labor.
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:15.500]  He's got to train you. He's got to take liability for you.
[01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:18.500]  He's sharing industry secrets now.
[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:20.500]  So that's kind of the trend.
[01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:30.500]  So my school offers for people who can be located in Santa Fe all these hands on opportunities to work at some premier facilities and get that kind of skill set.
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:35.500]  So, again, my school is for local, more northern New Mexico people.
[01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:43.500]  I have a pretty robust high school pipeline as well, where I did keep my online content to deliver to high schools.
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:49.500]  But I give schools systems for their classrooms, aquaponic systems with grow lights and all that.
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:53.500]  And I can monitor them online and check in with the students every week.
[01:49:54.500 --> 01:49:55.500]  So I kind of do some of that stuff as well.
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:00.500]  I travel with my students if they do the extra work and do research with me.
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:02.500]  I bring them to conferences.
[01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:10.500]  For instance, a goal right now for me is to create a zero discharge, zero waste greenhouse facility.
[01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:13.500]  I have a 12000 square foot greenhouse.
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.500]  I have a 500 square foot greenhouse.
[01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:19.500]  I always run through indoor grows and container farms.
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:28.500]  And within all those spaces is waste, roots and shoots and grow plugs that don't germinate and media that we're not using.
[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:30.500]  So I want to create zero discharge.
[01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:37.500]  What I've done in haste over the last couple of years is I pay a company to come pick up all my green waste.
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:40.500]  They turn that into OMRI approved compost.
[01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:42.500]  So I feel I'm doing the right thing for our community.
[01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:44.500]  But we want to be the example.
[01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:47.500]  So I just invested in worm bins.
[01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:49.500]  So I have a huge worm process.
[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:54.500]  We deal with things like biochar, another hour long conversation we could have.
[01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:57.500]  But I use a lot of the biochar dust with my vermi.
[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:02.500]  But I have all the green nitrogen waste from my production.
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:04.500]  And then we have woodworking on campus.
[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:07.500]  So they're segregating the sawdust that's non-treated.
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:09.500]  We're using their waste as well.
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:13.500]  If we don't have enough carbon, we have secretaries that are shredding paper.
[01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:15.500]  So trying to eliminate their waste.
[01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:18.500]  And when I worked at Lethbridge College, we were able to do that.
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:22.500]  A zero waste aquaponic facility.
[01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:25.500]  And we took carbon waste from campus and helped them reduce that.
[01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:27.500]  So another big kind of initiative.
[01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:31.500]  So in that case, that student will carry that on for a year with me.
[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:35.500]  And I'll take them traveling to the vermi conference of the year.
[01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:37.500]  Or I'll take them to an aquaponic conference.
[01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:42.500]  My ambition for that is, and I did this at Lethbridge College as well,
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:47.500]  is when those beds are established and I'm harvesting the worm castings,
[01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:50.500]  I make tea out of the worm castings.
[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:52.500]  And I do more hydroponics.
[01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:57.500]  So when I look around a lot of my facility, let's pick my aquaponic systems,
[01:51:58.500 --> 01:51:59.500]  my input is fish feed.
[01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:03.500]  I harvest tomatoes and I harvest kale and I harvest fish.
[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.500]  But I do have the waste of the roots and all that stuff.
[01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:11.500]  So if I, my rationale, if I compost that with the water,
[01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:16.500]  I harvest the worms and then I make tea and I grow more crops,
[01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:20.500]  then I'm growing more crops with the first input of fish feed.
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:22.500]  That's my input is fish feed.
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.500]  I could stop at the effluent and just get rid of it.
[01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.500]  Like old school, people were paying to get rid of that waste.
[01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:31.500]  But we see that now as a valuable resource.
[01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:34.500]  And that's where Leighton and I start to merge.
[01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:39.500]  We see that as the biology there.
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:43.500]  Whatever you do with it, whether you're decoupling your system,
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:48.500]  you're taking that and amending it and freezing it for fertilizer spikes
[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:53.500]  and you're fertilizing your trees, you're fertilizing ballparks,
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:55.500]  landscapes, golf courses.
[01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:58.500]  If you all have not seen what Leighton does, and again,
[01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:02.500]  the results from his work at rebuilding soil with some of these inoculums,
[01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:05.500]  that to me is the future.
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:09.500]  And so when I look back at my career, I think that it's also my past.
[01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.500]  It's what I did my entire life.
[01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:15.500]  I just didn't really understand what I was calling it.
[01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:20.500]  I would call what I've done my entire career now is focused on nutrient,
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:25.500]  excuse me, nutrient capture and nutrient reuse.
[01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:28.500]  We have limited resources on the planet.
[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:32.500]  As much as I advocate for hydroponics and I teach my students about
[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:36.500]  the wonders of hydroponics, how I can put together an NFT system today,
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.500]  mix the nutrients and start growing tomorrow.
[01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:44.500]  The reality is there's an environmental impact of those fertilizers.
[01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:47.500]  How did we get them? How did we manufacture those fertilizers?
[01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:50.500]  At what cost? Right?
[01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:54.500]  We look now with global supply chain and the Russia war on Ukraine,
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:56.500]  fertilizer costs have skyrocketed.
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:53:58.500]  I've seen farms go out of business.
[01:53:58.500 --> 01:53:59.500]  I saw a meme the other day.
[01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:03.500]  Well, these fertilizer prices, honey, I got to shut the business down.
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:08.500]  And somebody is like, no aquaponics, aquaponics, just feed the fish.
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:10.500]  So there's ways that we can do this.
[01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:12.500]  We've got to recapture nutrients.
[01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:20.500]  So whether we're remineralizing fish waste or pig waste or cow waste or human
[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:24.500]  waste or plant waste, we've got to start doing that.
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:26.500]  That's where the nutrients are.
[01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:27.500]  They're there.
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:31.500]  We don't have to keep going through the Haber-Bosch process, for instance,
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:36.500]  where we use three to 5% of the energy in the world to create nitrogen
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:41.500]  fertilizer when we breathe 70, 78% nitrogen.
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:45.500]  Maybe we should focus more on nitrogen fixing bacteria that can actually
[01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:47.500]  capture that nitrogen.
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:50.500]  Most plants can't, but there are ways to harness that.
[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.500]  Tesla used to look at lightning storms.
[01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:57.500]  During those events, it broke the N2 bond and plants could respond.
[01:54:58.500 --> 01:54:59.500]  Maybe we can capture that.
[01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:04.500]  So thinking about ways to recycle, recapture nutrients.
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.500]  There was an old Monty Python movie.
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:09.500]  I think it was the life of Brian.
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:12.500]  And there was a Catholic family, right?
[01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:14.500]  Every sperm is sacred.
[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:16.500]  And they had a whole house of kids.
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:18.500]  They couldn't get rid of any of them.
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:20.500]  Every sperm was sacred.
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:22.500]  I think every drop of water is sacred.
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:24.500]  Every nutrient is sacred.
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:26.500]  Why would we use it once?
[01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:31.500]  One of my inspirations when I came to New Mexico was Earthship community.
[01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:36.500]  You've heard me talk about community, community resiliency, food systems,
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:38.500]  energy systems, water systems.
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:42.500]  I really got into the Earthships and I take all my students there.
[01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:45.500]  Again, you come and get involved with my program.
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:47.500]  You don't have to be a student.
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:49.500]  I send out email blasts.
[01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:51.500]  Hey, we're going to Earthships for this weekend event.
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:53.500]  You can join us.
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.500]  But what they look at as well, every drop of water is precious.
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:01.500]  So from collecting that water, using it for your drinking,
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:04.500]  saving that through gray water for your toilet, that's another use.
[01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:09.500]  Saving that, growing through plants as a gray water, into plants.
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:12.500]  It's just amazing and it recycles and recycles and recycles.
[01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:14.500]  So that's what we're doing.
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:16.500]  We're trying to recycle nutrients.
[01:56:17.500 --> 01:56:18.500]  I get calls by NASA a lot.
[01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:20.500]  NASA is interested in this stuff.
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:24.500]  Water conservative recycling food production systems.
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:26.500]  Again, I'll challenge everybody here.
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:30.500]  I don't have time to do lit searches anymore in background,
[01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:32.500]  but I'll challenge anybody.
[01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:37.500]  What I often say is that aquaponics represents the most productive food systems
[01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:41.500]  in the world when it comes to nutrient and water use.
[01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:45.500]  Okay. I'm using waste nutrients from fish production.
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:47.500]  I'm in 99% recycle rate systems.
[01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:53.500]  I think sometimes we throw out these numbers and people have no idea how to relate that.
[01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:57.500]  How much food that I produce in a drop of water.
[01:56:58.500 --> 01:56:59.500]  It is shocking.
[01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:02.500]  And when you really look at the intensive fish production
[01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:07.500]  and the amount of kilos of protein that come out of a small fish tank,
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:09.500]  you'd be shocked at my water footprint.
[01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:13.500]  My water footprint is better than an insect farm.
[01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:17.500]  An insect farm takes more water than a ROS, a recirculating fish farm.
[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:19.500]  And I get the plants on top of it.
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:21.500]  Here's another way to look at it.
[01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:26.500]  The reason I do fish farming is because the fish have what we call
[01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:31.500]  the lowest feed conversion ratio of any animal that we farm.
[01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:36.500]  If I feed a cow roughly 13 pounds of food,
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:39.500]  it will grow about one pound of meat.
[01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:41.500]  These are some of the reasons.
[01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:43.500]  And I feed a pig about one pound of meat.
[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:46.500]  These are some kind of relative numbers, not specific.
[01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:50.500]  But these trends I'm about to mention are pretty consistent.
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:52.500]  A pig, maybe five to one.
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.500]  These are warm blooded animals.
[01:57:56.500 --> 01:57:59.500]  In the winter, I got to feed a cow just to maintain its internal temperature.
[01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.500]  They're very wasteful at resource use.
[01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:07.500]  A chicken, maybe down to three to one, maybe 2.5 to one.
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:10.500]  A fish is one to one in many cases.
[01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:16.500]  I feed a pound of fish food and I get a pound of flesh.
[01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:19.500]  And so just that alone is shocking.
[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:21.500]  This is why I do aquaculture.
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:24.500]  One to one feed conversion ratio.
[01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:28.500]  And I'm more of a realist and I'll report something like 1.4.
[01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:32.500]  1.4 pounds of food to one pound of flesh.
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:34.500]  That's what a fish farmer gets.
[01:58:35.500 --> 01:58:37.500]  Look what I've done is I've taken it to an extreme.
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:40.500]  I used that water again and got all the vegetables.
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:45.500]  I got double the quantity of food on the same amount of water.
[01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:54.500]  So if you believe in alchemy, I can say that my food conversion ratio is one to four.
[01:58:55.500 --> 01:59:00.500]  Every pound of fish food I put in there, I get four pounds of edible food.
[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:02.500]  How the hell can that happen?
[01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:04.500]  It's a microbial dynamic.
[01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:07.500]  It's a really, as we used to say, the black box.
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:09.500]  It's magic.
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:12.500]  It's wise use of nutrients is what it is.
[01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:16.500]  It's me using those nutrients a couple of times to add up those numbers.
[01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:18.500]  But it's what we need to be doing.
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:21.500]  So again, that's the future of farming.
[01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:23.500]  I think it's part of the future of farming.
[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:29.500]  We're still going to have massive soil farms with cereals and energy crops like that for humanity.
[01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:35.500]  But when we're in tight places where there's no water, islands, like I said, St. Croix is where this started.
[01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:37.500]  Those are communities that are isolated.
[01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:40.500]  Pueblos, communities that are isolated.
[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:46.500]  I was recently in Mexico and I was networking down there.
[01:59:47.500 --> 01:59:48.500]  I was at a conference.
[01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:50.500]  I ended up with COVID.
[01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:52.500]  It was a crappy week for a bit.
[01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:55.500]  But I had a friend in this community that's a mutual friends with Leighton.
[01:59:56.500 --> 02:00:00.500]  He's trying to develop a community project near him.
[02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:02.500]  We're trying to pitch it.
[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:04.500]  We're coming up with some key words.
[02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:06.500]  He says, here's what I've come up with.
[02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:19.500]  This aquaponic model that he wants for his community of 300 houses, it represents safe food production for smaller groups of freer people.
[02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:22.500]  I see people drawn to aquaponics.
[02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:24.500]  We want to be freer.
[02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:27.500]  We want to be off of the grid.
[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:32.500]  We want to be commune life, maybe, or your own individual life.
[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:34.500]  You want to help other people.
[02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:36.500]  I see aquaponics fitting smaller groups.
[02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:43.500]  When I look at the successful commercial models out there, I can still count them on one hand.
[02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:45.500]  You're not going to find many more commercial models.
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:48.500]  Two hands, maybe, if I include cannabis now.
[02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:50.500]  That's it.
[02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:54.500]  Those cannabis businesses, they've been in business two years and three years.
[02:00:55.500 --> 02:01:00.500]  You may see them on the internet, but they're destined to go out of business like every other small business.
[02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:03.500]  Again, indoor farming, is that profitable?
[02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:05.500]  Aquaponics, is it profitable?
[02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:07.500]  It may not be.
[02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:09.500]  It may not be the focus is to make money.
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:16.500]  Your focus may be for healthy communities, healthy food, using less resources because you have less resources.
[02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:20.500]  These apply themselves in very harsh environments.
[02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:26.500]  They are really good use of resources if you're a limited resource farmer.
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:30.500]  As I said at one point today, play to your resources.
[02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:33.500]  If you have a lot of water, use it.
[02:01:34.500 --> 02:01:36.500]  You don't need to be recirculating 99% of your water.
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:41.500]  If you live in the subtropics where you never get a freeze, take advantage of that.
[02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:43.500]  Don't go inside.
[02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:44.500]  If you're in New Mexico, maybe don't go inside.
[02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:46.500]  Take advantage of sunlight.
[02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:52.500]  One of my best shipping container models ever is an indoor fish farm.
[02:01:53.500 --> 02:01:58.500]  I put my fish in the insulated container, and I put a greenhouse on top of the container.
[02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:02.500]  We pump fish water up to zip grow towers, vertical towers.
[02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:08.500]  I took advantage of natural sunlight, and I'm still doing shipping container farming, which is nice.
[02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:10.500]  It's a nice footprint.
[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:19.500]  This model that we had had solar thermal panels that actually took the heat from the sun and heated my water perfectly to 78 degrees for tilapia.
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:23.500]  Year-round in Santa Fe, we're 7,000 foot up.
[02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:25.500]  We've had three snows this year already.
[02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:29.500]  That model was keeping my tilapia temperature spot on.
[02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:32.500]  We had three PV panels charging batteries.
[02:02:33.500 --> 02:02:36.500]  A shipping container, greenhouse on top, off grid.
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:40.500]  For anybody listening, that's called the farm pod.
[02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:43.500]  You can find that easily if you search the internet.
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:47.500]  Lots of things we get involved with.
[02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:49.500]  Community projects as well.
[02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:55.500]  A lot of my students either are spawning commercial businesses or community farms.
[02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:59.500]  Another one that I can mention, it's Luz de Sol.
[02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:03.500]  I don't think they have much web presence, but it's a 42-foot dome greenhouse.
[02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:07.500]  I operate a dome greenhouse as well here.
[02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:12.500]  This dome greenhouse has aquaponics, hydroponics, and soil production.
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:15.500]  It serves 14 families.
[02:03:16.500 --> 02:03:20.500]  They have a volunteer list of who works it every week or every day.
[02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:22.500]  That rotates.
[02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:24.500]  They feed the fish.
[02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:27.500]  They do the chemistry, plant production, pest control, everything that needs to be done.
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:29.500]  There's no profit intended there.
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:33.500]  Honestly, as they got started, they were having some challenges.
[02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:39.500]  Some people in the community demanded that they use certified organic fish feed.
[02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:48.500]  I made the point that there is no certified organic fish, so they would not be able to sell their fish as organic.
[02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:51.500]  They said, well, we're not selling our fish either.
[02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:54.500]  We just only support organic production.
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:58.500]  I said, well, I can tell you one that I know the manufacturer.
[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:00.500]  He was a former student of mine.
[02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:08.500]  If you look at that organic fish food that's available from different sources, it's not designed for a specific fish.
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:12.500]  It's not for tilapia or catfish or koi or goldfish.
[02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:18.500]  I told her, you're not going to get the best growth rates because it's not designed for your fish in particular.
[02:04:19.500 --> 02:04:22.500]  Another problem with her fish feed, and everybody beware,
[02:04:22.500 --> 02:04:23.500]  that the fish feed sank.
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:27.500]  When she gave it to the fish, it just sank to the bottom.
[02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:31.500]  The fish that she was growing do not like to eat off the bottom.
[02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:33.500]  It was very inefficient.
[02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:35.500]  She was wasting money.
[02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:37.500]  I had a meeting with the community.
[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:43.500]  She had me come and talk about this issue because I was trying to convince her to go with a conventional fish diet.
[02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:51.500]  Something like an optimal fish food is a brand that has better quality ingredients that maybe she could use.
[02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:54.500]  She could go with no GMO ingredients.
[02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:56.500]  She could use those kind of keywords.
[02:04:57.500 --> 02:04:58.500]  They were still resistant to it.
[02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:00.500]  I went and talked to them.
[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:02.500]  I said, let's look at the ingredients here.
[02:05:03.500 --> 02:05:06.500]  All these organic saffron, everything you could think of thrown in this diet.
[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:11.500]  I said, this diet is, I think it was $16 a pound for that diet.
[02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:15.500]  I pay 80 cents a pound for my diet.
[02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:19.500]  I said, you all would be better off just eating that fish food.
[02:05:19.500 --> 02:05:20.500]  You're wasting it in the fish tank.
[02:05:21.500 --> 02:05:24.500]  Just go buy 16 pound food and eat it.
[02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:30.500]  Then go buy that 60 cent food to give to your aquatic composter, your fish.
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:32.500]  If you want the nutrients.
[02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:34.500]  There's a lot of decisions to be made.
[02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:39.500]  Everybody here that's listening and that will listen, we all have different goals.
[02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:44.500]  There's a lot of resources out there that can help you, whether your goals are fish.
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:47.500]  Then we can design the plant side of things.
[02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:48.500]  Or your goals are plants.
[02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:51.500]  We back calculate and design the fish side of things.
[02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:56.500]  Be careful in this industry of what we call the aqua shyster.
[02:05:57.500 --> 02:06:01.500]  That's the person that's out there selling you stuff that you may not need.
[02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:06.500]  I'm an advocate for let your systems break in naturally.
[02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:11.500]  If anybody here goes and gets that aquarium when put some goldfish in it,
[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:15.500]  don't buy the bacteria that that guy's selling in the fish store.
[02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:16.500]  Let it happen naturally.
[02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:19.500]  When you feed fish, they create ammonia.
[02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:22.500]  The bacteria will come.
[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:27.500]  I don't think it's a bad idea to maybe go borrow some water from Brian.
[02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:29.500]  That's got good bacteria in it.
[02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:31.500]  And you know, it doesn't have any diseases.
[02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:36.500]  And maybe then go inoculate your system or stop by Santa Fe Community College.
[02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:38.500]  I'll give you a gallon of inoculum.
[02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:40.500]  I think that's okay.
[02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:44.500]  But buying something, these bacteria,
[02:06:45.500 --> 02:06:48.500]  that we're talking about are aerobic bacteria.
[02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:50.500]  They need oxygen to live.
[02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:56.500]  So how can a bottle sitting on PetSmart shelf for three months,
[02:06:57.500 --> 02:06:59.500]  how can those bacteria be alive and active?
[02:07:00.500 --> 02:07:01.500]  They can't.
[02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:05.500]  In another podcast, maybe, ask Leighton about the shipping
[02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:09.500]  and the storage of some of these microbial inoculums.
[02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:11.500]  You got to keep that stuff alive.
[02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:13.500]  So there are techniques to doing all this.
[02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:15.500]  Yeah, on and on.
[02:07:16.500 --> 02:07:19.500]  Let's see if there's any specific topic I should drag.
[02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:22.500]  Oh man, you covered a lot, which was great.
[02:07:23.500 --> 02:07:27.500]  And I love how you circle back and provide the backup information
[02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:30.500]  on everything that you're stating, which is really important.
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:34.500]  And one of the reasons why I was so excited when we reconnected recently
[02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:38.500]  was because I was like, oh my God, this is an amazing resource.
[02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:41.500]  What you've done, you know, post Eric Highfield
[02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:43.500]  and to present is just amazing.
[02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:49.500]  And, you know, I thought your online program was beautiful and wonderful,
[02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:53.500]  but I agree with you in the essence that even if you do complete
[02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:55.500]  an online course, you got to have the hands-on.
[02:07:56.500 --> 02:07:57.500]  The experience is just critical.
[02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:02.500]  And at one point I was supporting Dr. Elaine's students.
[02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:04.500]  We were going to send them to boot camp for the summer.
[02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:10.500]  So it was a three-month postgraduate from her soil food web class
[02:08:11.500 --> 02:08:12.500]  to get them in the field.
[02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:15.500]  And she agreed that that was one of the most important things
[02:08:16.500 --> 02:08:20.500]  was that it's fine to be book smart, but if you're not dirt smart,
[02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:24.500]  you're missing a huge piece of the puzzle.
[02:08:25.500 --> 02:08:29.500]  So, you know, again, big kudos to you for offering these programs
[02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:34.500]  and then encouraging people to take this seriously
[02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:37.500]  to become perhaps a teacher in the future.
[02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:39.500]  Because each one teaches one, right brother?
[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:44.500]  I didn't, you know, of course, Leighton, you and I didn't see ourselves as teachers.
[02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:48.500]  And Leighton used to throw granite slabs on his back every day of his life.
[02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:51.500]  At that point, he had no idea he'd be a teacher like he is.
[02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:53.500]  I didn't know I'd be a teacher.
[02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:55.500]  Let me just take a few minutes.
[02:08:56.500 --> 02:08:57.500]  Actually, how much time do we have on the?
[02:08:58.500 --> 02:08:59.500]  We're good. You're good.
[02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:01.500]  Yeah. Fifty minutes.
[02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:03.500]  Okay, good. About that time. Cool. At two o'clock, my time.
[02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:07.500]  Let me walk through my kind of my background, my CV,
[02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:10.500]  because I just want to mention a few very important places,
[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:13.500]  then resources that will come out of this small discussion.
[02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:21.500]  When I was in high school, I had changed my diet to eating birds and fish around 1988.
[02:09:22.500 --> 02:09:26.500]  This time I saw red meat was not really a sustainable way to feed a planet.
[02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:30.500]  I saw birds and fish because of that feed conversion ratio
[02:09:31.500 --> 02:09:32.500]  really were the way that we could eat.
[02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:35.500]  At that time, too, we were still wild harvesting fish
[02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:36.500]  and we still wild harvest fish.
[02:09:37.500 --> 02:09:40.500]  It's the only livestock that we still wild harvest.
[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:44.500]  And because of that, I'm often criticized in my industry.
[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:47.500]  Fish farming, fish farming, fish farming.
[02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:51.500]  We like wild. I'm like, well, you know, the only reason you criticize me
[02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:55.500]  is we can't do wild pigs anymore and wild cattle and wild deer and wild.
[02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:58.500]  There's no other commodity like that that we can still farm.
[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:03.500]  But in 1989, 1988, eating birds and fish.
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:06.500]  I thought that was a great way to consume at that time.
[02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:12.500]  And on every nightly news channel, all we had was three channels back then.
[02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:17.500]  CBS, NBC, ABC, and every one of those channels this night
[02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:21.500]  showed this dramatic story about medical waste washing up
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:24.500]  on the seashore around Atlantic City.
[02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:27.500]  This was before plastics were prevalent in the ocean.
[02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:31.500]  This was before every beach was littered in plastic.
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:34.500]  This was the first beach that really we saw this visually,
[02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:39.500]  the plastics on the beach, not only plastics, but it was medical waste.
[02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:43.500]  So the mafia trash companies up on the East Coast
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:47.500]  were contracted to take medical waste and they went off the deep sea
[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:50.500]  and dumped it out of sight, out of mind.
[02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:54.500]  Dilution is the solution to pollution, that kind of mindset.
[02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:57.500]  But we knew that was persistent.
[02:10:58.500 --> 02:10:59.500]  We knew that stuff wasn't going to go away.
[02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:01.500]  And it washed up on our seashore.
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:04.500]  That was my light bulb moment for my career,
[02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:08.500]  because I thought at that moment that the open systems
[02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:10.500]  were too contaminated to farm.
[02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:13.500]  I had no interest in farming the ocean.
[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:16.500]  When you have that kind of contamination floating around,
[02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:20.500]  I don't think that what we thought was this infinite resource,
[02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:26.500]  pristine resource, I was again, light bulb slapped across my head.
[02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:30.500]  I cannot eat fish. Oh my God.
[02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:33.500]  And at the same time on the backside,
[02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:38.500]  the slap coming back across was, Charlie, you can grow fish indoors.
[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:42.500]  You can grow fish in rainwater, in tank based systems.
[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:46.500]  I probably knew a little bit about aquaculture.
[02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:49.500]  In high school, high times was my textbook.
[02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:51.500]  I knew everything about growing cannabis.
[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:54.500]  I was a closet grower back in the day as well.
[02:11:54.500 --> 02:11:59.500]  But aquaculture, growing indoors, and I finally knew what I wanted to do.
[02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:01.500]  I floundered around.
[02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:04.500]  I was a deadhead and went on tour and all this kind of stuff
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:06.500]  before I knew what I wanted.
[02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:09.500]  Went to the guard, as I mentioned, just to make some income.
[02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:13.500]  And I was a paralegal, so I got some skills through that.
[02:12:14.500 --> 02:12:17.500]  But when I was really ready, I went back and honed in on aquaculture.
[02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:21.500]  The best school in the nation at that time was Virginia Tech.
[02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:24.500]  If you wanted to specialize in recirculating aquaculture.
[02:12:25.500 --> 02:12:26.500]  And that's what aquaponic systems are.
[02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:29.500]  They're recirculating aquaculture systems.
[02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:32.500]  We just happen to use plants as our biofilter
[02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:36.500]  instead of an expensive biofilter that you may buy.
[02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:38.500]  So I knew what I wanted to do.
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:40.500]  I went to school for aquaculture.
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:42.500]  I couldn't get in Virginia Tech.
[02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:44.500]  My grades sucked.
[02:12:45.500 --> 02:12:46.500]  I was a hippie that floundered around.
[02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:49.500]  So I put myself into Mississippi State,
[02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:52.500]  which was one of the biggest fish schools as well,
[02:12:53.500 --> 02:12:54.500]  because I knew I'd get an education.
[02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:57.500]  But I knew that those were ponds that they focused on.
[02:12:58.500 --> 02:12:59.500]  Outdoor pond production.
[02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:02.500]  And I was still afraid of the environment.
[02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:06.500]  I thought pond production was not the best way to grow.
[02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:08.500]  You're exposed to food safety issues,
[02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:10.500]  birds coming in and shitting,
[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:13.500]  turtles coming through and giving salmonella to your product.
[02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:15.500]  I needed controlled environment.
[02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:18.500]  Something just sparked in me that we needed control.
[02:13:19.500 --> 02:13:20.500]  I needed controlled environments.
[02:13:21.500 --> 02:13:22.500]  If you're all cannabis growers,
[02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:24.500]  you know how important that is now
[02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:27.500]  as we're being regulated to have clean, healthy product.
[02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:29.500]  So I went to Mississippi State.
[02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:31.500]  That launched me into Virginia Tech.
[02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:34.500]  And when I started school, I knew what I wanted to do.
[02:13:35.500 --> 02:13:37.500]  I smoked every day.
[02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:39.500]  I'm a cannabis advocate.
[02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:42.500]  But I knew from my background
[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:44.500]  that cannabis has the propensity
[02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:47.500]  to maybe be distracting for me.
[02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:48.500]  I like to pick up my guitar.
[02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:50.500]  I like to play music.
[02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:52.500]  I like to hang out with my friends.
[02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:54.500]  I love to ride a bike.
[02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:56.500]  I'm very distracted when I get that lift.
[02:13:57.500 --> 02:13:58.500]  I made myself focus on my school.
[02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:00.500]  I said, if you're going to do this, get straight A's.
[02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:02.500]  Focus on what you want.
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:04.500]  This is cool stuff.
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:06.500]  So I found it was a benefit to me.
[02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:08.500]  And it was a medicine as I went through school
[02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:10.500]  to keep me level.
[02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:13.500]  Virginia Tech, I also, again, working with the best.
[02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:15.500]  I mentioned that earlier.
[02:14:15.500 --> 02:14:16.500]  I went to Virginia Tech.
[02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:18.500]  I went to that school.
[02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:20.500]  I pursued it.
[02:14:21.500 --> 02:14:22.500]  I started my fishery science degree.
[02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:24.500]  Knew what I wanted to do.
[02:14:25.500 --> 02:14:27.500]  Most people around me were studying endangered species
[02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:29.500]  and stocking little darter species
[02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:31.500]  up in the rivers and streams,
[02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:33.500]  because that's where the money was.
[02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:35.500]  Muscles and this kind of stuff.
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:37.500]  I wanted food fish.
[02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:39.500]  And fortunately, the state of Virginia
[02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:42.500]  allocated money every year to food fish research.
[02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:44.500]  So Virginia Tech got a lot of money.
[02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:48.500]  I honed in on tilapia specifically
[02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:50.500]  for sustainability reasons.
[02:14:51.500 --> 02:14:52.500]  But we grew everything you can imagine
[02:14:53.500 --> 02:14:54.500]  in recirculating systems.
[02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:57.500]  When I first started, I volunteered.
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:14:59.500]  I tell all my students now,
[02:15:00.500 --> 02:15:01.500]  and if you're listening here,
[02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:03.500]  volunteer if you want to get in the door.
[02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:06.500]  Students now to me are entitled.
[02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:08.500]  They have a sense of entitlement.
[02:15:09.500 --> 02:15:10.500]  They're not going to volunteer.
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:12.500]  They don't want to work for any less than 20 bucks an hour.
[02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:14.500]  I tell them all the time,
[02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:17.500]  everything that I did, I got to by volunteering.
[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:19.500]  So I went in, I volunteered,
[02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:21.500]  and I said, I'll clean the filters.
[02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:23.500]  I want to learn aquaculture.
[02:15:24.500 --> 02:15:25.500]  I'll do all the grunt jobs.
[02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:27.500]  Six months later, they hired me.
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:29.500]  I got the job and it had a fancy title
[02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:31.500]  of Tilapia Broodstock Manager.
[02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:33.500]  As an undergraduate,
[02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:35.500]  I was in charge of all of our tilapia,
[02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:37.500]  keeping the breeding line separate.
[02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:39.500]  And I was working for a grad student.
[02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:41.500]  Fell in love with tilapia,
[02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:43.500]  fell in love with freshwater aquaculture.
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:45.500]  I realized that all those nutrients were in the water.
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:47.500]  And I asked my professor if I could play
[02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:49.500]  with what I researched and called aquaponics.
[02:15:50.500 --> 02:15:52.500]  I knew about Jim Ricossi through scientific literature.
[02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:54.500]  And my Virginia Tech professors
[02:15:55.500 --> 02:15:56.500]  let me play with aquaponics.
[02:15:57.500 --> 02:15:58.500]  From what I knew from high times,
[02:15:59.500 --> 02:16:00.500]  I could put a pump in the water
[02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:02.500]  and maybe do a bed on a tilt
[02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:04.500]  and fill it up with rock wool,
[02:16:05.500 --> 02:16:06.500]  plant plants in there,
[02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:08.500]  and just flood fish water across it all day long.
[02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:10.500]  So I did small plugs and I crushed it
[02:16:11.500 --> 02:16:12.500]  with basil and lettuce and all this.
[02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:14.500]  And this is before people really knew
[02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:16.500]  you could do this.
[02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:18.500]  And so my professors were kind of excited
[02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:20.500]  because what I started to talk to them about
[02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:22.500]  is if we could actually design this right,
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:24.500]  at scale,
[02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:26.500]  this could be the entire biofilter.
[02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:29.500]  We can use plants to clean the water.
[02:16:30.500 --> 02:16:31.500]  And then I found a little bit of research
[02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:33.500]  from Jim Ricossi.
[02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:35.500]  And then I asked him, I said,
[02:16:36.500 --> 02:16:37.500]  can I try cherry tomatoes?
[02:16:38.500 --> 02:16:39.500]  Well, sure, but it's not going to work.
[02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:41.500]  We don't think there's, it's,
[02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:42.500]  my cherry tomatoes went crazy.
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:44.500]  And that right then and there,
[02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:46.500]  they were all shocked about aquaponics
[02:16:47.500 --> 02:16:48.500]  that it could work.
[02:16:49.500 --> 02:16:50.500]  And so I focused at that time on
[02:16:51.500 --> 02:16:52.500]  where can I go next?
[02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:54.500]  The best place in the world,
[02:16:55.500 --> 02:16:56.500]  University of the Virgin Islands
[02:16:57.500 --> 02:16:58.500]  with Jim Ricossi.
[02:16:59.500 --> 02:17:00.500]  I kept an eye on that facility.
[02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:02.500]  I also, when I was at Virginia Tech,
[02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:04.500]  said I need to rise above everybody else.
[02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:06.500]  So I got a second bachelor degree.
[02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:08.500]  I added one more year.
[02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:10.500]  So I got a degree in fishery science
[02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:12.500]  and I got a job at a company.
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:14.500]  So later in life,
[02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:16.500]  it came back when I applied
[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:18.500]  for the Virgin Island job,
[02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:20.500]  there's 200 people applied.
[02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:22.500]  There was three with two majors.
[02:17:23.500 --> 02:17:24.500]  So I rose right to the top.
[02:17:25.500 --> 02:17:26.500]  So that's a helpful tip
[02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:28.500]  for any student who's out there.
[02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:30.500]  At Virginia Tech,
[02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:32.500]  we again started playing with aquaponics,
[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:34.500]  but I had to move on.
[02:17:35.500 --> 02:17:36.500]  I had to get a job.
[02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:38.500]  Leighton, a story that's related.
[02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:40.500]  At that time,
[02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:42.500]  I was working in a facility
[02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:44.500]  near Allentown.
[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:46.500]  Bill Verano's facility.
[02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:48.500]  No, no.
[02:17:48.500 --> 02:17:49.500]  This was a big indoor facility.
[02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:52.500]  And this guy became an aqua shyster.
[02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:54.500]  It was where Steve Van Gorder
[02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:57.500]  was working as the waste treatment specialist.
[02:17:58.500 --> 02:17:59.500]  So it's a big facility up there
[02:18:00.500 --> 02:18:01.500]  in Allentown, right near Allentown.
[02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:03.500]  And I had mentioned the idea, everybody,
[02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:05.500]  beware of the aqua shyster.
[02:18:06.500 --> 02:18:07.500]  So as a young graduate
[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:09.500]  or young undergrad, I just finished.
[02:18:09.500 --> 02:18:10.500]  I had a job interview
[02:18:11.500 --> 02:18:12.500]  and there were no aquaculture jobs available.
[02:18:13.500 --> 02:18:14.500]  This was a beautiful facility.
[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:16.500]  Steve Van Gorder is a name
[02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:18.500]  some of you may know.
[02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:20.500]  He's got a book out called
[02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:22.500]  Small Scale Aquaculture,
[02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:24.500]  really highly rated book.
[02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:26.500]  Steve worked there.
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:28.500]  So I had a friend in there,
[02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:30.500]  but I met the owner
[02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:32.500]  and I literally got hair standing up
[02:18:33.500 --> 02:18:34.500]  on my neck and arms.
[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:36.500]  Just there was something weird about the guy.
[02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:38.500]  Great interview.
[02:18:38.500 --> 02:18:39.500]  Called him up and turned down the job.
[02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:41.500]  Only job offer I had.
[02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:43.500]  A year later, the guy got
[02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:46.500]  indicted for securities fraud.
[02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:49.500]  He was using this big money corporation
[02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:51.500]  to scam off money.
[02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:53.500]  So I'm glad we did that.
[02:18:54.500 --> 02:18:55.500]  That's part of the history of
[02:18:56.500 --> 02:18:57.500]  beware of the aqua shyster.
[02:18:58.500 --> 02:18:59.500]  I didn't have a job.
[02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:01.500]  I looked and found a job
[02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:03.500]  at University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia.
[02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:05.500]  And I was a fish.
[02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:07.500]  Yeah.
[02:19:08.500 --> 02:19:09.500]  I was back in the day with
[02:19:10.500 --> 02:19:11.500]  widespread panic and REM and B15.
[02:19:12.500 --> 02:19:13.500]  And I was a technician.
[02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:15.500]  I wasn't even a student.
[02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:17.500]  It was the year widespread panic
[02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:19.500]  had the concert in the street.
[02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:22.500]  I think 1998 panic in the streets.
[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:24.500]  Very famous year.
[02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:26.500]  So I worked there a couple of years.
[02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:28.500]  I bought a house there.
[02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:30.500]  My job was to keep fish
[02:19:31.500 --> 02:19:32.500]  for genetic engineering,
[02:19:33.500 --> 02:19:34.500]  believe it or not.
[02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:36.500]  Sometimes if I wrote a book,
[02:19:36.500 --> 02:19:37.500]  I'd write about genetic engineering of fish.
[02:19:38.500 --> 02:19:40.500]  We weren't genetic engineering of food fish.
[02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:42.500]  We were creating lab fish,
[02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:45.500]  lab fish to replace a lab rat.
[02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:47.500]  There's a lot of reasons why fish
[02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:50.500]  are a very good model for toxicology.
[02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:52.500]  One is I can do a simple fin clip,
[02:19:53.500 --> 02:19:55.500]  just cut off the back fin of a fish
[02:19:56.500 --> 02:19:57.500]  and extract the DNA from that
[02:19:58.500 --> 02:19:59.500]  to analyze it.
[02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:01.500]  And the fish regrows its fin.
[02:20:02.500 --> 02:20:03.500]  A lot of lab rat work back in the day.
[02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:05.500]  You had to sacrifice the rat.
[02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:08.500]  The female rat was always killed and sacrificed.
[02:20:09.500 --> 02:20:10.500]  Of the main reason you do fish
[02:20:11.500 --> 02:20:12.500]  for genetic engineering work
[02:20:13.500 --> 02:20:15.500]  is because a lot of fish are external fertilizers
[02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:17.500]  of their embryo.
[02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:19.500]  So I worked with a saltwater fish
[02:20:20.500 --> 02:20:21.500]  and a freshwater fish.
[02:20:22.500 --> 02:20:23.500]  The freshwater fish,
[02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:26.500]  the female would expel her unfertilized eggs
[02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:29.500]  in a sticky mass on her belly.
[02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:31.500]  The male would come by
[02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:33.500]  and release sperm
[02:20:34.500 --> 02:20:35.500]  and fertilize those eggs.
[02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:38.500]  So I could time spawning of that fish
[02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:41.500]  and clean the fish off with unfertilized eggs,
[02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:43.500]  put them back together.
[02:20:44.500 --> 02:20:45.500]  And every five minutes
[02:20:46.500 --> 02:20:47.500]  on the 30th day of the month,
[02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:49.500]  I would go back in there.
[02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:51.500]  And if she had eggs,
[02:20:52.500 --> 02:20:53.500]  I'd collect them because they would be
[02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:55.500]  just freshly fertilized.
[02:20:56.500 --> 02:20:57.500]  And now you have a new zygote.
[02:20:58.500 --> 02:20:59.500]  And that's where you want to do
[02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:01.500]  foreign DNA injection
[02:21:02.500 --> 02:21:03.500]  is in a very new organism
[02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:05.500]  that's just developing.
[02:21:06.500 --> 02:21:07.500]  So we would go in again
[02:21:08.500 --> 02:21:09.500]  every five minutes after it's clean,
[02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:11.500]  check the little sponges and stuff
[02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:13.500]  and get these new embryos.
[02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:16.500]  Nothing to do with aquaponics.
[02:21:17.500 --> 02:21:18.500]  I was pulling myself away
[02:21:19.500 --> 02:21:20.500]  from my passion of producing food.
[02:21:21.500 --> 02:21:22.500]  And near where I bought my house,
[02:21:23.500 --> 02:21:24.500]  there was a new mushroom facility.
[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:26.500]  And I had set up a job
[02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:28.500]  to be the night manager.
[02:21:29.500 --> 02:21:30.500]  And I went to my boss
[02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:32.500]  where I keep the fish and I said,
[02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:34.500]  look, I'm going to be taking a night job as well.
[02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:35.500]  I'm just letting you know.
[02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:37.500]  And he's like, well,
[02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:38.500]  I don't think that's a good idea.
[02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:40.500]  It's going to distract from your day job.
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:42.500]  And I was saying, you know,
[02:21:42.500 --> 02:21:43.500]  well, it's kind of my life.
[02:21:44.500 --> 02:21:45.500]  I'm OK doing that.
[02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:46.500]  But my passion is food.
[02:21:46.500 --> 02:21:47.500]  I got to do it.
[02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:48.500]  And he kind of scolded me again.
[02:21:49.500 --> 02:21:50.500]  And when he did the second time,
[02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:53.500]  the phone rang and it was Jim Ricosi
[02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:55.500]  saying he knew about me.
[02:21:56.500 --> 02:21:57.500]  He got my application
[02:21:57.500 --> 02:21:58.500]  and he wants to fly me to the Virgin Islands
[02:21:59.500 --> 02:22:01.500]  to help him work on his food production systems.
[02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:03.500]  So I just said, I'll call you back.
[02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:05.500]  And I had almost instant karma.
[02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:08.500]  Somebody telling me I couldn't really follow my passions.
[02:22:09.500 --> 02:22:10.500]  And then the next minute, somebody saying,
[02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:12.500]  hey, let's get you down here.
[02:22:13.500 --> 02:22:14.500]  So I knew I'd get the job if I went down there.
[02:22:15.500 --> 02:22:16.500]  And I spent 13 years down there.
[02:22:18.500 --> 02:22:20.500]  We produce two food production systems.
[02:22:21.500 --> 02:22:22.500]  Aquaponics were famous for.
[02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:24.500]  So again, Scholar.Google,
[02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:27.500]  look up UVI Aquaponics.
[02:22:28.500 --> 02:22:29.500]  Also, if you're a fish farmer,
[02:22:30.500 --> 02:22:32.500]  we created the BioFlock system.
[02:22:32.500 --> 02:22:34.500]  So we have the UVI BioFlock system,
[02:22:35.500 --> 02:22:36.500]  which doesn't involve plants,
[02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:39.500]  but it's a closed loop system
[02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:42.500]  that uses algae to assimilate the nutrients
[02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:44.500]  so you can recycle that water
[02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:46.500]  over and over and over again.
[02:22:47.500 --> 02:22:48.500]  And the fish consume the algae
[02:22:49.500 --> 02:22:50.500]  and get a probiotic effect
[02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:52.500]  and free nutrition from that.
[02:22:53.500 --> 02:22:55.500]  So that 1.4 to 1 feed conversion ratio
[02:22:56.500 --> 02:22:57.500]  is actually lowered.
[02:22:58.500 --> 02:22:59.500]  Water conservative, high production.
[02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:01.500]  Again, these were our mandates.
[02:23:02.500 --> 02:23:03.500]  And so both of those systems
[02:23:04.500 --> 02:23:05.500]  had an effluent discharge.
[02:23:06.500 --> 02:23:08.500]  With aquaponics, the liquid waste fed the plants,
[02:23:09.500 --> 02:23:11.500]  but we did discharge the solid waste.
[02:23:12.500 --> 02:23:13.500]  On the BioFlock system,
[02:23:14.500 --> 02:23:15.500]  we discharged the solid waste.
[02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:17.500]  And instead of paying to get rid of it,
[02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:19.500]  we used it to build soil.
[02:23:20.500 --> 02:23:21.500]  We put it in soil plots
[02:23:22.500 --> 02:23:23.500]  and we showed over time,
[02:23:24.500 --> 02:23:25.500]  not only immediately did we get
[02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:29.500]  as good as as good or better than production
[02:23:30.500 --> 02:23:31.500]  with conventional fertilizer,
[02:23:32.500 --> 02:23:33.500]  but over time, those plots
[02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:35.500]  kept doing better and better
[02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:37.500]  without reapplication
[02:23:38.500 --> 02:23:39.500]  because of the organic matter
[02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:41.500]  that was left behind.
[02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:43.500]  So when we finished experiments,
[02:23:44.500 --> 02:23:45.500]  we continued to look at those plots
[02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:47.500]  and the soil was built.
[02:23:48.500 --> 02:23:49.500]  It was an amazing story.
[02:23:50.500 --> 02:23:51.500]  The other things we did with our effluent
[02:23:52.500 --> 02:23:53.500]  was we dewatered it.
[02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:55.500]  We understood water conservation.
[02:23:56.500 --> 02:23:57.500]  So could we take the liquid slurry,
[02:23:58.500 --> 02:23:59.500]  the sludge,
[02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:01.500]  push it through a geomembrane textile bag
[02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:03.500]  literally,
[02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:05.500]  and what came out was water
[02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:07.500]  and the solid waste was retained
[02:24:08.500 --> 02:24:09.500]  in the geotextile bags.
[02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:11.500]  We returned the water to the system.
[02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:16.500]  So when we used to say 98.5% recycle rate,
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:18.500]  now we could be even tighter than that,
[02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:20.500]  returning the water.
[02:24:21.500 --> 02:24:23.500]  And then the solids are left in the bag
[02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:26.500]  can be used for soil applications as well.
[02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:28.500]  We built compost with that.
[02:24:29.500 --> 02:24:30.500]  We have published articles on that.
[02:24:30.500 --> 02:24:32.500]  If you look up my name on scholar.google
[02:24:33.500 --> 02:24:34.500]  and aquaponics,
[02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:36.500]  you'll find trials where we took solid waste
[02:24:37.500 --> 02:24:38.500]  and did different composting trials
[02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:40.500]  and we made a seeding media.
[02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:42.500]  So instead of using ProMix
[02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:45.500]  and buying a 94515 fertilizer,
[02:24:46.500 --> 02:24:47.500]  which was my regular routine
[02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:49.500]  of seedling production,
[02:24:50.500 --> 02:24:52.500]  I could take fish waste and straw
[02:24:53.500 --> 02:24:55.500]  and make a compost seeding media
[02:24:56.500 --> 02:24:57.500]  and do all my seedling productions
[02:24:58.500 --> 02:24:59.500]  without that extra cost.
[02:25:00.500 --> 02:25:01.500]  And that's how we came out of that.
[02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:03.500]  During that time,
[02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:05.500]  we understood that when you put
[02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:07.500]  the liquid sludge on your field,
[02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:09.500]  plants can't use that.
[02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:11.500]  They can use the little bit of water
[02:25:12.500 --> 02:25:13.500]  that has some dissolved nutrients,
[02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:15.500]  but it's solid waste.
[02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:18.500]  It's nutrients bound up in solid matter.
[02:25:19.500 --> 02:25:20.500]  If you put a cow patty
[02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:23.500]  on top of your peach tree soil,
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:25.500]  the tree can't use it.
[02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:27.500]  We rely on organisms to start
[02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:29.500]  breaking it down, detritivores,
[02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:31.500]  into smaller pieces,
[02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:33.500]  same thing with fish waste.
[02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:35.500]  It's got to break down.
[02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:37.500]  It's got to start to what we call
[02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:39.500]  remineralize, so those nutrients
[02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:41.500]  have to become available.
[02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:43.500]  In our industry, we use an aerated
[02:25:44.500 --> 02:25:45.500]  septic tank, basically,
[02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:47.500]  and we call these remineralization tanks.
[02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:49.500]  Again, most of you know
[02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:51.500]  some of this information.
[02:25:52.500 --> 02:25:54.500]  At UVI, we didn't have to do that.
[02:25:55.500 --> 02:25:56.500]  We had soil that we could apply to
[02:25:57.500 --> 02:25:58.500]  year-round.
[02:25:58.500 --> 02:25:59.500]  Leighton and I, once we were
[02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:01.500]  involved in a project in Canada,
[02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:03.500]  we thought that's a great idea.
[02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:05.500]  Put your solids out on the field.
[02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:07.500]  Well, you can't do that half the year
[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:09.500]  because it's a tundra.
[02:26:10.500 --> 02:26:11.500]  We had to come up with what do we do?
[02:26:12.500 --> 02:26:13.500]  How do we store it?
[02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:15.500]  How do we break it down?
[02:26:16.500 --> 02:26:17.500]  How do we stabilize it?
[02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:19.500]  In the tropics, you've got a
[02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:21.500]  beautiful environment where we
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:23.500]  could do that.
[02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:24.500]  In other regions, you can't.
[02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:26.500]  We understood that it took a while
[02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:27.500]  to get there, but if we could
[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:29.500]  enhance the breakdown and speed it
[02:26:30.500 --> 02:26:31.500]  up, then maybe we could return the
[02:26:32.500 --> 02:26:33.500]  nutrients back to the fish tank.
[02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:35.500]  This is very common now in
[02:26:36.500 --> 02:26:37.500]  aquaponics and decoupled systems
[02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:39.500]  or people that have side loop
[02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:41.500]  systems.
[02:26:41.500 --> 02:26:42.500]  They remineralize.
[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:44.500]  They break down their fish waste,
[02:26:45.500 --> 02:26:46.500]  which takes about 30 days,
[02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:48.500]  in a loop.
[02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:50.500]  They let their tanks settle.
[02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:52.500]  They put the clear water back
[02:26:53.500 --> 02:26:54.500]  into their system.
[02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:55.500]  That's a huge trend right now.
[02:26:56.500 --> 02:26:57.500]  The only research ever done on
[02:26:58.500 --> 02:26:59.500]  that was from us at UVI.
[02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:01.500]  We didn't even do that.
[02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:03.500]  We just understood that you could
[02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:06.500]  do that, so we did a bucket study.
[02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:08.500]  If you are still listening to
[02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:10.500]  this long conversation, if you
[02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:12.500]  go to yourscholar.google,
[02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:14.500]  one way to find research, put in
[02:27:15.500 --> 02:27:16.500]  my name, and the paper starts
[02:27:17.500 --> 02:27:18.500]  with something like preliminary
[02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:21.500]  evaluation of organic waste.
[02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:23.500]  You'll find it.
[02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:25.500]  We took buckets of sludge from
[02:27:26.500 --> 02:27:27.500]  our biofloc system and added
[02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:29.500]  aeration.
[02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:32.500]  That fed the aerobic bacteria.
[02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:35.500]  Every day I took samples.
[02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:38.500]  How much of every nutrient?
[02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:40.500]  The 13 nutrients that I think I
[02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:42.500]  named them for you earlier,
[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:44.500]  that plant required essential
[02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:46.500]  nutrients, I looked at the
[02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:48.500]  concentration every day.
[02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:50.500]  How long did it take your aerobic
[02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:52.500]  breakdown to release the calcium,
[02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:54.500]  the phosphorus, the potassium,
[02:27:54.500 --> 02:27:55.500]  the nitrogen, the molybdenum,
[02:27:56.500 --> 02:27:57.500]  the iron, every nutrient profile.
[02:27:58.500 --> 02:27:59.500]  If you can get access to the
[02:28:00.500 --> 02:28:01.500]  paper, those are in graphs.
[02:28:02.500 --> 02:28:03.500]  They show you at day five,
[02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:05.500]  calcium was mostly released.
[02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:07.500]  It's available now for plants.
[02:28:08.500 --> 02:28:10.500]  As most of you know, phosphorus
[02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:12.500]  is the most bound up, locked
[02:28:13.500 --> 02:28:14.500]  out nutrient.
[02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:16.500]  It's hard to get dissolved
[02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:18.500]  phosphorus available.
[02:28:19.500 --> 02:28:20.500]  Many of you are involved maybe
[02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:23.500]  in phosphor soluble,
[02:28:24.500 --> 02:28:26.500]  I use mammoth P sometimes in
[02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:28.500]  my products.
[02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:30.500]  I have another product.
[02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:32.500]  I should promote it, but
[02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:34.500]  somebody gave it to me, but it's
[02:28:35.500 --> 02:28:36.500]  in the other room.
[02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:38.500]  A lot of us are focused on that.
[02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:40.500]  My graph showed phosphorus was
[02:28:41.500 --> 02:28:42.500]  the last one to release.
[02:28:43.500 --> 02:28:44.500]  It took about 30 days at
[02:28:45.500 --> 02:28:46.500]  constant aeration, maintaining
[02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:48.500]  about maybe seven parts per
[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:50.500]  million of oxygen, at ambient
[02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:52.500]  temperature in the Caribbean,
[02:28:52.500 --> 02:28:53.500]  probably 75 degrees.
[02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:55.500]  We start to optimize these
[02:28:56.500 --> 02:28:57.500]  conditions and we can recapture
[02:28:58.500 --> 02:28:59.500]  the nutrients.
[02:29:00.500 --> 02:29:01.500]  We started doing a little of
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:03.500]  that work at UVI, but we didn't
[02:29:04.500 --> 02:29:05.500]  have to return to our system.
[02:29:06.500 --> 02:29:07.500]  We have already dialed in a
[02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:09.500]  beautiful system that produces
[02:29:10.500 --> 02:29:11.500]  11,000 pounds of fish every year
[02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:13.500]  and 11,000 pounds of basil or
[02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:15.500]  X number of cases of lettuce,
[02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:17.500]  blah, blah, blah.
[02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:19.500]  We have all that down.
[02:29:20.500 --> 02:29:21.500]  We didn't want to change that
[02:29:22.500 --> 02:29:23.500]  system.
[02:29:23.500 --> 02:29:24.500]  We wanted to make it a
[02:29:25.500 --> 02:29:26.500]  fertilizer.
[02:29:26.500 --> 02:29:27.500]  Can we mineralize our waste and
[02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:29.500]  bottle it?
[02:29:29.500 --> 02:29:30.500]  Sell it on the market.
[02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:32.500]  That's the trend right now.
[02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:34.500]  That's what cow farmers should
[02:29:35.500 --> 02:29:36.500]  be doing, pig farmers should be
[02:29:37.500 --> 02:29:38.500]  doing.
[02:29:38.500 --> 02:29:39.500]  We have done the work with
[02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:41.500]  chicken manure and we do the
[02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:43.500]  work all the time now with fish
[02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:45.500]  manure.
[02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:46.500]  Let's just break down what you
[02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:48.500]  have, aerate it until it is
[02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:50.500]  dissolved nutrients and take
[02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:51.500]  it to a plant.
[02:29:51.500 --> 02:29:52.500]  Let's look at a nutrient
[02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:54.500]  profile.
[02:29:54.500 --> 02:29:55.500]  If I want to sell this to
[02:29:56.500 --> 02:29:57.500]  Layton because he is flowering
[02:29:58.500 --> 02:29:59.500]  cannabis, I am going to tailor
[02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:01.500]  it to a flowering solution.
[02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:02.500]  If I want to sell it to Brian
[02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:04.500]  because he is doing a veg cycle,
[02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:06.500]  I am going to tailor it to a
[02:30:07.500 --> 02:30:08.500]  veg and sell it to him.
[02:30:08.500 --> 02:30:09.500]  Maybe 80% of my nutrients are
[02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:11.500]  already there for free from
[02:30:12.500 --> 02:30:13.500]  fish waste.
[02:30:13.500 --> 02:30:14.500]  UVI really pioneered a lot of
[02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:16.500]  this work.
[02:30:16.500 --> 02:30:17.500]  A lot of people say, oh, it is
[02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:19.500]  a simple system and I want to
[02:30:20.500 --> 02:30:21.500]  build a system.
[02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:22.500]  One water pump.
[02:30:22.500 --> 02:30:23.500]  I see people right now that
[02:30:24.500 --> 02:30:25.500]  combine side loops and five
[02:30:26.500 --> 02:30:27.500]  pumps, four pumps in their
[02:30:28.500 --> 02:30:29.500]  system and if one of those
[02:30:30.500 --> 02:30:31.500]  pumps either breaks down or
[02:30:32.500 --> 02:30:33.500]  just loses efficiency and can't
[02:30:34.500 --> 02:30:35.500]  keep up with the flow rates
[02:30:36.500 --> 02:30:38.500]  that you had designed with a
[02:30:38.500 --> 02:30:39.500]  fully efficient pump, your
[02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:41.500]  system goes haywire.
[02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:42.500]  The number of businesses that
[02:30:43.500 --> 02:30:44.500]  have failed because of system
[02:30:45.500 --> 02:30:46.500]  design flaws is shocking.
[02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:47.500]  It is usually related to their
[02:30:47.500 --> 02:30:48.500]  system does not manage solid
[02:30:49.500 --> 02:30:50.500]  waste appropriately.
[02:30:50.500 --> 02:30:51.500]  They look on the Internet and
[02:30:52.500 --> 02:30:53.500]  they see my IBC system and they
[02:30:54.500 --> 02:30:55.500]  say, well, Charlie doesn't have
[02:30:56.500 --> 02:30:57.500]  a solid filter on that tank.
[02:30:57.500 --> 02:30:59.500]  I told you, I only feed 12
[02:31:00.500 --> 02:31:01.500]  grams to that tank.
[02:31:01.500 --> 02:31:02.500]  I am very careful not to
[02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:04.500]  overfeed it.
[02:31:04.500 --> 02:31:05.500]  In my systems where I don't
[02:31:06.500 --> 02:31:07.500]  have a solids filter, removing
[02:31:08.500 --> 02:31:09.500]  solids, I have got worms in
[02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:11.500]  those beds and they are helping
[02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:13.500]  process the solids that would
[02:31:14.500 --> 02:31:15.500]  otherwise be in the tank.
[02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:16.500]  Their waste will be mineralized
[02:31:17.500 --> 02:31:18.500]  by the next organism and the
[02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:20.500]  next organism until eventually
[02:31:21.500 --> 02:31:22.500]  we have released nutrients.
[02:31:22.500 --> 02:31:24.500]  The worms can't take fish waste
[02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:26.500]  and give me usable nutrients.
[02:31:27.500 --> 02:31:28.500]  The worms are taking fish waste
[02:31:29.500 --> 02:31:30.500]  and giving me worm castings,
[02:31:31.500 --> 02:31:32.500]  which is still worm shit.
[02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:34.500]  The nutrients are still bound
[02:31:35.500 --> 02:31:36.500]  up.
[02:31:36.500 --> 02:31:37.500]  I need smaller organisms to
[02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:39.500]  continue to break that down.
[02:31:39.500 --> 02:31:41.500]  I am not going to be able to
[02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:43.500]  keep up with the flow rates
[02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:44.500]  of the worms.
[02:31:44.500 --> 02:31:45.500]  I need aerobic, aquatic, in my
[02:31:46.500 --> 02:31:47.500]  case, bacteria and microbes
[02:31:48.500 --> 02:31:49.500]  that are going to release it
[02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:51.500]  into the dissolved forms.
[02:31:51.500 --> 02:31:53.500]  I am an advocate for hydroponics
[02:31:54.500 --> 02:31:55.500]  and aquaponics.
[02:31:55.500 --> 02:31:57.500]  I think K is K and P is P.
[02:31:58.500 --> 02:31:59.500]  Manganese is manganese.
[02:31:59.500 --> 02:32:00.500]  Whether it came from a
[02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:02.500]  synthetic source or an organic
[02:32:03.500 --> 02:32:04.500]  source, when it is broken down
[02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:06.500]  into usable form, my plants
[02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:08.500]  tell me that is the plant food
[02:32:09.500 --> 02:32:10.500]  that they want.
[02:32:10.500 --> 02:32:11.500]  Again, I am not going to
[02:32:11.500 --> 02:32:12.500]  be able to keep up with the
[02:32:12.500 --> 02:32:13.500]  flow rates of the worms.
[02:32:13.500 --> 02:32:14.500]  I like the combination.
[02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:15.500]  I can also say that a lot of
[02:32:16.500 --> 02:32:17.500]  people still listening, you are
[02:32:18.500 --> 02:32:19.500]  focused on aquaponics.
[02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:20.500]  You may have no interest in
[02:32:21.500 --> 02:32:22.500]  hydroponics and nutrient salt
[02:32:23.500 --> 02:32:24.500]  calculations.
[02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:25.500]  Sometimes we call aquaponics
[02:32:26.500 --> 02:32:27.500]  lazy man's hydroponics.
[02:32:28.500 --> 02:32:29.500]  I don't look and adjust.
[02:32:30.500 --> 02:32:31.500]  I don't open up my Howard
[02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:33.500]  Resch hydroponic book and try
[02:32:34.500 --> 02:32:35.500]  to emulate a cannabis recipe.
[02:32:36.500 --> 02:32:37.500]  It is fish water.
[02:32:38.500 --> 02:32:39.500]  I want to find a plant that
[02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:40.500]  works with fish water.
[02:32:40.500 --> 02:32:41.500]  Again, I don't follow certain
[02:32:42.500 --> 02:32:43.500]  recommendations.
[02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:44.500]  I trust that aquaponics
[02:32:45.500 --> 02:32:46.500]  systems can work.
[02:32:46.500 --> 02:32:47.500]  Aquaponics systems get better
[02:32:48.500 --> 02:32:49.500]  over time.
[02:32:49.500 --> 02:32:50.500]  Working with bigger
[02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:52.500]  aquaponics systems can be
[02:32:53.500 --> 02:32:54.500]  easier than working with
[02:32:54.500 --> 02:32:55.500]  smaller aquaponics systems.
[02:32:55.500 --> 02:32:56.500]  The crops, again, can be
[02:32:57.500 --> 02:32:58.500]  certified organic.
[02:32:58.500 --> 02:32:59.500]  There is a lot of
[02:33:00.500 --> 02:33:01.500]  controversy about that.
[02:33:01.500 --> 02:33:02.500]  I don't know if it is true.
[02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:04.500]  I don't know if it is true.
[02:33:05.500 --> 02:33:06.500]  I don't know if it is true.
[02:33:06.500 --> 02:33:07.500]  I don't know if it is true.
[02:33:07.500 --> 02:33:08.500]  There is a lot of
[02:33:09.500 --> 02:33:10.500]  controversy.
[02:33:10.500 --> 02:33:11.500]  I call some people involved
[02:33:12.500 --> 02:33:13.500]  soil snobs.
[02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:15.500]  I see people that do
[02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:17.500]  not want water-based farms
[02:33:18.500 --> 02:33:19.500]  like aquaponics to be certified
[02:33:19.500 --> 02:33:20.500]  organic.
[02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:21.500]  They have captured
[02:33:22.500 --> 02:33:23.500]  websites like the Real
[02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:25.500]  Organic Project.
[02:33:26.500 --> 02:33:27.500]  Our stuff is real.
[02:33:28.500 --> 02:33:29.500]  Their stuff is not real.
[02:33:30.500 --> 02:33:31.500]  At the end of the day, we need
[02:33:31.500 --> 02:33:32.500]  more organic food
[02:33:33.500 --> 02:33:34.500]  at a cheaper price for the
[02:33:35.500 --> 02:33:36.500]  people who need it.
[02:33:36.500 --> 02:33:37.500]  If we isolate and
[02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:39.500]  we only allow systems
[02:33:40.500 --> 02:33:41.500]  that were envisioned in
[02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:43.500]  1990, that is when
[02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:45.500]  the organic program came out.
[02:33:46.500 --> 02:33:47.500]  Nobody envisioned aquaponics.
[02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:49.500]  That was when I was just
[02:33:49.500 --> 02:33:50.500]  starting it.
[02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:51.500]  Nobody in those committees
[02:33:52.500 --> 02:33:53.500]  even saw aquaponics.
[02:33:54.500 --> 02:33:55.500]  It was written to soil
[02:33:56.500 --> 02:33:57.500]  standards.
[02:33:57.500 --> 02:33:58.500]  If we just get stuck in that
[02:33:58.500 --> 02:33:59.500]  mentality, then we are not
[02:34:00.500 --> 02:34:01.500]  allowing for new technologies
[02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:03.500]  that can produce healthy food.
[02:34:04.500 --> 02:34:05.500]  I can validate my food's
[02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:06.500]  healthy.
[02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:07.500]  I do all the time.
[02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:08.500]  I send it away for analysis.
[02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:10.500]  In Texas, when I ran
[02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:12.500]  I'm about to get to Texas.
[02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:14.500]  I'll share that story
[02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:16.500]  when I get there.
[02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:17.500]  After Jim
[02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:19.500]  Ricossi retired, I had
[02:34:20.500 --> 02:34:21.500]  been there 13 years.
[02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:23.500]  I saw that as a chance to
[02:34:24.500 --> 02:34:25.500]  get back to the States.
[02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:26.500]  I had a kid.
[02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:27.500]  I get her up near grandma
[02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:28.500]  and grandpa.
[02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:30.500]  But what do I do?
[02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:31.500]  I need a job.
[02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:32.500]  I looked around.
[02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:33.500]  There are no aquaponic jobs
[02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:34.500]  at that time.
[02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:35.500]  Somebody convinced me,
[02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:37.500]  the lead of the program at
[02:34:37.500 --> 02:34:38.500]  Kentucky State University,
[02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:40.500]  Jim Tidwell, said,
[02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:42.500]  come to college.
[02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:43.500]  It's like you've been out of
[02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:44.500]  college for 16 years.
[02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:46.500]  Come get your master's degree.
[02:34:47.500 --> 02:34:48.500]  He told me at that time
[02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:50.500]  that he said, Charlie,
[02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:53.500]  I can take you in.
[02:34:54.500 --> 02:34:55.500]  I can pay for you to come
[02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:56.500]  to college.
[02:34:56.500 --> 02:34:57.500]  I can give you a blank
[02:34:58.500 --> 02:34:59.500]  footprint in a brand new
[02:34:59.500 --> 02:35:00.500]  building.
[02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:01.500]  I'll give you a blank
[02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:02.500]  checkbook.
[02:35:02.500 --> 02:35:03.500]  You can do anything you want.
[02:35:04.500 --> 02:35:05.500]  But I can't teach you
[02:35:05.500 --> 02:35:07.500]  anything about aquaponics.
[02:35:07.500 --> 02:35:09.500]  He said, you're the guru.
[02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:11.500]  We're the guru fish school.
[02:35:12.500 --> 02:35:13.500]  So we want you to come.
[02:35:13.500 --> 02:35:14.500]  We want you to develop our
[02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:16.500]  program while you're a grad
[02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:17.500]  student.
[02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:18.500]  So that's what I did.
[02:35:18.500 --> 02:35:19.500]  I had a beautiful brand new
[02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:21.500]  building, open checkbook.
[02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:22.500]  I built six, six
[02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:24.500]  replicated systems so
[02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:26.500]  we could do scientific
[02:35:26.500 --> 02:35:27.500]  validated research.
[02:35:28.500 --> 02:35:30.500]  And since that time, 2011,
[02:35:30.500 --> 02:35:32.500]  I finished my research.
[02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:33.500]  There's probably been seven
[02:35:33.500 --> 02:35:34.500]  published papers on those
[02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:36.500]  systems because with science,
[02:35:36.500 --> 02:35:38.500]  you've got to have replication
[02:35:38.500 --> 02:35:40.500]  so we could look at three.
[02:35:40.500 --> 02:35:41.500]  There were six reps.
[02:35:41.500 --> 02:35:42.500]  I could do three tanks of
[02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:44.500]  tilapia, three tanks of large
[02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:45.500]  mouth bass.
[02:35:45.500 --> 02:35:46.500]  I could do six tanks of
[02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:48.500]  tilapia and three tanks of
[02:35:49.500 --> 02:35:50.500]  optimal fish food and three
[02:35:50.500 --> 02:35:52.500]  tanks of cargill fish food.
[02:35:52.500 --> 02:35:54.500]  I could do plant research.
[02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:55.500]  What I did for my master's
[02:35:56.500 --> 02:35:58.500]  research, knowing that I just
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:00.500]  came from the ideal environment,
[02:36:00.500 --> 02:36:02.500]  outdoor facility to
[02:36:02.500 --> 02:36:03.500]  indoor aquaponics.
[02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:05.500]  I wanted to test the economic
[02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:07.500]  feasibility of indoor
[02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:08.500]  production.
[02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:09.500]  When we move to temperate
[02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:11.500]  climates that almost all of you
[02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:12.500]  live in, when you have a cold
[02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:14.500]  season, we have to go indoors or
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:16.500]  protect our crops.
[02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:17.500]  So when we go indoors, the one
[02:36:18.500 --> 02:36:19.500]  thing we have to supply 100
[02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:20.500]  percent is lighting.
[02:36:21.500 --> 02:36:22.500]  So I did lighting as my
[02:36:22.500 --> 02:36:23.500]  variable.
[02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:24.500]  I mentioned earlier my
[02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:25.500]  replicates, my different
[02:36:26.500 --> 02:36:27.500]  lightings that I use.
[02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:28.500]  I looked at the yield under
[02:36:28.500 --> 02:36:29.500]  those lights.
[02:36:29.500 --> 02:36:31.500]  I looked at the energy use per
[02:36:31.500 --> 02:36:32.500]  yield under those lights.
[02:36:32.500 --> 02:36:33.500]  And I looked at the nutrient
[02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:35.500]  quality under the lights.
[02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:37.500]  Is my basil and pak choy any
[02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:40.500]  healthier under LED than it was
[02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:42.500]  under metal halide or
[02:36:43.500 --> 02:36:44.500]  fluorescent or induction?
[02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:45.500]  So this is some of the first
[02:36:46.500 --> 02:36:47.500]  lighting research that came out.
[02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:49.500]  Again, looking at economic
[02:36:50.500 --> 02:36:51.500]  viability.
[02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:52.500]  Ten years later, 12 years
[02:36:53.500 --> 02:36:55.500]  later, I still say the economic
[02:36:56.500 --> 02:36:57.500]  analysis, the jury is still out.
[02:36:58.500 --> 02:36:59.500]  We don't know if it's economic
[02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:00.500]  liable to do this or not.
[02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:02.500]  But the paper is published as
[02:37:03.500 --> 02:37:05.500]  well through the aquaculture
[02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:08.500]  journal, the world journal of
[02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:10.500]  aquaculture.
[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:11.500]  Again, scholar, find my name,
[02:37:12.500 --> 02:37:13.500]  and you'll find that paper.
[02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:15.500]  Again, I spawned a community
[02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:17.500]  there.
[02:37:17.500 --> 02:37:18.500]  If you're around Kentucky, the
[02:37:19.500 --> 02:37:20.500]  famous facility to check out is
[02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:22.500]  called Food Chain.
[02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:25.500]  The idea of a facility where
[02:37:26.500 --> 02:37:27.500]  all these food related
[02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:28.500]  businesses are interacting like
[02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:30.500]  a chain.
[02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:31.500]  The first company that came in,
[02:37:32.500 --> 02:37:33.500]  there was a brewery.
[02:37:33.500 --> 02:37:35.500]  It's called West Sixth Brewery.
[02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:37.500]  They're famous in Kentucky.
[02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:40.500]  And so they came in and renovated
[02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:43.500]  a rainbow bread facility, an old
[02:37:44.500 --> 02:37:45.500]  abandoned food facility that was
[02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:47.500]  built to last.
[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:48.500]  Washable walls, very hardy
[02:37:49.500 --> 02:37:50.500]  building.
[02:37:50.500 --> 02:37:51.500]  My recommendation is you're going
[02:37:52.500 --> 02:37:54.500]  to renovate an urban building.
[02:37:55.500 --> 02:37:56.500]  Make sure it's built to last.
[02:37:57.500 --> 02:37:59.500]  The idea of getting a cheap
[02:38:00.500 --> 02:38:01.500]  abandoned Home Depot or Walmart,
[02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:03.500]  those buildings are designed to
[02:38:04.500 --> 02:38:05.500]  collapse, designed to last about
[02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:07.500]  15 years.
[02:38:07.500 --> 02:38:08.500]  That's why they keep moving to a
[02:38:08.500 --> 02:38:09.500]  new one.
[02:38:09.500 --> 02:38:10.500]  So don't take an old one and put
[02:38:11.500 --> 02:38:12.500]  a fish farm in it.
[02:38:12.500 --> 02:38:13.500]  It's not going to last.
[02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:15.500]  But a big rainbow bread, these
[02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:17.500]  kind of facilities, this worked.
[02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:19.500]  The brewery worked.
[02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:21.500]  And the wife of one
[02:38:22.500 --> 02:38:23.500]  of the owners wanted to do indoor
[02:38:23.500 --> 02:38:24.500]  fish farm.
[02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:25.500]  It was her creation.
[02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:26.500]  I moved to Kentucky as she was
[02:38:27.500 --> 02:38:28.500]  brainstorming.
[02:38:28.500 --> 02:38:29.500]  And when she found out I landed
[02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:31.500]  in Kentucky, it was like the stars
[02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:33.500]  aligned.
[02:38:33.500 --> 02:38:35.500]  We met initially, planned this out.
[02:38:35.500 --> 02:38:37.500]  And now this has become an amazing
[02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:39.500]  facility as a tourist trap.
[02:38:40.500 --> 02:38:41.500]  Next to the brewery is the fish
[02:38:41.500 --> 02:38:42.500]  farm.
[02:38:42.500 --> 02:38:43.500]  We built a restaurant.
[02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:45.500]  So the idea of food miles, we
[02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:46.500]  throw that away.
[02:38:46.500 --> 02:38:48.500]  We talk about food feet.
[02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:50.500]  We're 50 feet from the restaurant
[02:38:50.500 --> 02:38:51.500]  where the fish tanks are.
[02:38:52.500 --> 02:38:53.500]  The way that we built the fish
[02:38:53.500 --> 02:38:54.500]  tank is we built a fish tank
[02:38:54.500 --> 02:38:56.500]  that's 50 feet from the restaurant
[02:38:56.500 --> 02:38:57.500]  where the fish tanks are.
[02:38:57.500 --> 02:38:58.500]  The waste goes into a mushroom
[02:38:59.500 --> 02:39:00.500]  facility.
[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:02.500]  The spent brewer's grain from the
[02:39:02.500 --> 02:39:04.500]  fish farm is now part of the fish
[02:39:05.500 --> 02:39:06.500]  food ingredient.
[02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:07.500]  So it's the carbohydrates that are
[02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:09.500]  used for some of the fish diets in
[02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:10.500]  the facility.
[02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:11.500]  And there's a commercial kitchen
[02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:13.500]  now.
[02:39:13.500 --> 02:39:14.500]  So Lexington, Kentucky, food
[02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:16.500]  chain, find that facility if
[02:39:17.500 --> 02:39:18.500]  you want a model for your
[02:39:19.500 --> 02:39:20.500]  community.
[02:39:20.500 --> 02:39:21.500]  I go now to different communities
[02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:22.500]  and I'm blown away.
[02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:23.500]  I've been to a lot of hubs and
[02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:24.500]  very interactive places and I'm
[02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:25.500]  blown away.
[02:39:26.500 --> 02:39:27.500]  If you're stuck in a small
[02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:28.500]  community, you need to get out.
[02:39:29.500 --> 02:39:30.500]  Get out to these city complexes
[02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:32.500]  and look how communities are
[02:39:32.500 --> 02:39:34.500]  coming together with hubs that
[02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:36.500]  have so many spokes going off.
[02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:38.500]  They're helping so many things.
[02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:40.500]  And it started with a brewery and
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:41.500]  a fish farm.
[02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:43.500]  So that's a really good example
[02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:44.500]  of what I left there.
[02:39:44.500 --> 02:39:46.500]  I also left a seven hundred and
[02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:47.500]  fifty thousand dollar grant.
[02:39:48.500 --> 02:39:50.500]  So I got a grant to continue
[02:39:50.500 --> 02:39:51.500]  my extension in aquaponics and
[02:39:52.500 --> 02:39:53.500]  food safety and aquaponics.
[02:39:54.500 --> 02:39:55.500]  But at the same time, there was a
[02:39:55.500 --> 02:39:56.500]  position in Canada that
[02:39:57.500 --> 02:39:58.500]  was really well paid.
[02:39:59.500 --> 02:40:00.500]  The description was perfectly for
[02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:02.500]  me.
[02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:03.500]  My wife said it was just
[02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:05.500]  tailor-made, which I think it was.
[02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:07.500]  And so I moved.
[02:40:07.500 --> 02:40:08.500]  I left my grant in Kentucky with
[02:40:09.500 --> 02:40:10.500]  the Kentucky folks and I went to
[02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:11.500]  Canada for two years.
[02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:13.500]  I worked at Lethbridge College,
[02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:15.500]  which I've mentioned a lot.
[02:40:15.500 --> 02:40:16.500]  Everybody should be looking at
[02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:17.500]  Lethbridge College if you're
[02:40:18.500 --> 02:40:19.500]  studying this.
[02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:20.500]  But we have a new
[02:40:21.500 --> 02:40:22.500]  paradigm in
[02:40:23.500 --> 02:40:24.500]  delivery of classes called
[02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:26.500]  micro credentials.
[02:40:27.500 --> 02:40:28.500]  Instead of coming to SFCC and
[02:40:29.500 --> 02:40:30.500]  getting a certificate, which takes
[02:40:30.500 --> 02:40:31.500]  a year or an associate's
[02:40:32.500 --> 02:40:33.500]  degree, which takes two years,
[02:40:34.500 --> 02:40:36.500]  the trend in industries right now
[02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:38.500]  are to get micro credentials
[02:40:39.500 --> 02:40:40.500]  and they're small nugget
[02:40:41.500 --> 02:40:42.500]  sized courses.
[02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:44.500]  They're self-paced often and
[02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:46.500]  you make it do it in a week.
[02:40:47.500 --> 02:40:48.500]  You make it do it in two weeks and
[02:40:49.500 --> 02:40:50.500]  you get a little digital badge
[02:40:51.500 --> 02:40:52.500]  that now is attached to digital
[02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:54.500]  resumes and shit.
[02:40:55.500 --> 02:40:56.500]  Sorry, as a teacher, I shouldn't
[02:40:56.500 --> 02:40:57.500]  say that.
[02:40:57.500 --> 02:40:58.500]  I should be encouraging you to
[02:40:58.500 --> 02:40:59.500]  get this.
[02:41:00.500 --> 02:41:01.500]  It's a little nugget.
[02:41:01.500 --> 02:41:02.500]  So if you can imagine your
[02:41:02.500 --> 02:41:04.500]  industry living soil or
[02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:06.500]  cannabis, you may have one
[02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:08.500]  for soil preparation.
[02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:10.500]  You may have one for microbial
[02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:11.500]  identification.
[02:41:12.500 --> 02:41:14.500]  You may have a nugget course on
[02:41:14.500 --> 02:41:16.500]  microscopy, how to use
[02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:17.500]  a microscope.
[02:41:17.500 --> 02:41:18.500]  So that's the idea.
[02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:19.500]  You know, those are the little
[02:41:19.500 --> 02:41:21.500]  nuggets of skills that
[02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:24.500]  a upcoming technician
[02:41:24.500 --> 02:41:26.500]  may want those credentials
[02:41:26.500 --> 02:41:27.500]  for my industry.
[02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:29.500]  It would be water quality for
[02:41:29.500 --> 02:41:31.500]  aquaponics, fish
[02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:33.500]  production and aquaponics,
[02:41:33.500 --> 02:41:35.500]  plant production and aquaponics,
[02:41:35.500 --> 02:41:37.500]  natural pest control,
[02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:38.500]  waste management.
[02:41:38.500 --> 02:41:40.500]  So Lethbridge College right
[02:41:40.500 --> 02:41:42.500]  now has seven of those courses
[02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:43.500]  available.
[02:41:43.500 --> 02:41:45.500]  And I was looking recently at
[02:41:45.500 --> 02:41:46.500]  one hundred dollars a course.
[02:41:46.500 --> 02:41:47.500]  I think that's Canadian.
[02:41:48.500 --> 02:41:49.500]  We're talking seventy five bucks
[02:41:49.500 --> 02:41:51.500]  or eighty bucks for you to
[02:41:51.500 --> 02:41:52.500]  take a course and get
[02:41:53.500 --> 02:41:54.500]  credentials for your resume.
[02:41:55.500 --> 02:41:56.500]  So if you're looking to get in
[02:41:56.500 --> 02:41:57.500]  the industry, credentials are
[02:41:57.500 --> 02:41:59.500]  very important, whether it's a
[02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:00.500]  safety class or these
[02:42:01.500 --> 02:42:03.500]  microcredentials or degrees.
[02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:04.500]  It's really good to get that.
[02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:06.500]  So Lethbridge has moved
[02:42:06.500 --> 02:42:07.500]  on.
[02:42:07.500 --> 02:42:09.500]  I got a two million dollar
[02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:10.500]  grant when I was there.
[02:42:10.500 --> 02:42:11.500]  Nick Savinov and I put
[02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:13.500]  our heads together, wrote a
[02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:15.500]  grant and got two million
[02:42:15.500 --> 02:42:16.500]  dollars.
[02:42:16.500 --> 02:42:18.500]  I left that grant as well.
[02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:20.500]  When I left, I convinced Nick
[02:42:20.500 --> 02:42:22.500]  Savinov to take my job and
[02:42:22.500 --> 02:42:24.500]  he leads Lethbridge College now
[02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:26.500]  in aquaponics and they're the
[02:42:26.500 --> 02:42:28.500]  ones doing waste
[02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:31.500]  remineralization and optimizing
[02:42:31.500 --> 02:42:33.500]  that and really even looking
[02:42:33.500 --> 02:42:35.500]  at that idea of taking chicken
[02:42:35.500 --> 02:42:36.500]  waste, fish waste,
[02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:38.500]  remineralizing it.
[02:42:38.500 --> 02:42:39.500]  So you have a clear nutrient
[02:42:39.500 --> 02:42:40.500]  solution.
[02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:41.500]  And he's really looking at how
[02:42:41.500 --> 02:42:42.500]  do we monetize that.
[02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:44.500]  So how do you stabilize that
[02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:45.500]  we're going to drive the pH
[02:42:45.500 --> 02:42:46.500]  down.
[02:42:46.500 --> 02:42:48.500]  How do you make that consistent.
[02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:49.500]  You know, you don't want to put
[02:42:49.500 --> 02:42:51.500]  a bottle of fish juice on
[02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:53.500]  the market if it's still
[02:42:53.500 --> 02:42:54.500]  biologically active.
[02:42:55.500 --> 02:42:56.500]  A month later, the old lady is
[02:42:56.500 --> 02:42:57.500]  going to open it at home and
[02:42:57.500 --> 02:42:58.500]  it's going to spray all over
[02:42:58.500 --> 02:43:00.500]  her like the old fish emulsion.
[02:43:00.500 --> 02:43:02.500]  Right. That was the stinkiest
[02:43:02.500 --> 02:43:03.500]  stuff ever.
[02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:04.500]  It's still there.
[02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:06.500]  But we want to look at ways that
[02:43:06.500 --> 02:43:07.500]  we can make it more acceptable
[02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:08.500]  for the market.
[02:43:08.500 --> 02:43:09.500]  So they do a lot of work with
[02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:10.500]  curriculum.
[02:43:10.500 --> 02:43:12.500]  You can get involved during
[02:43:12.500 --> 02:43:13.500]  doing a lot of the work with
[02:43:13.500 --> 02:43:14.500]  the waste.
[02:43:14.500 --> 02:43:16.500]  I saw a quick chat and I'm not
[02:43:16.500 --> 02:43:17.500]  seeing all the chat, but
[02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:19.500]  somebody did say, yes, come back
[02:43:19.500 --> 02:43:20.500]  on and let's talk biochar.
[02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:23.500]  Nick Sabadov is really
[02:43:23.500 --> 02:43:25.500]  he's been the guru that pushed me
[02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:26.500]  into biochar.
[02:43:27.500 --> 02:43:29.500]  Again, we could talk a long time.
[02:43:29.500 --> 02:43:31.500]  Biochar is the waste
[02:43:31.500 --> 02:43:33.500]  product from
[02:43:33.500 --> 02:43:35.500]  pyrolysis or gasification
[02:43:36.500 --> 02:43:37.500]  where we're burning waste to
[02:43:37.500 --> 02:43:38.500]  create energy.
[02:43:39.500 --> 02:43:40.500]  It's a solution to our in our
[02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:41.500]  waste problems.
[02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:42.500]  We can burn it and we can
[02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:44.500]  get pure carbon.
[02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:46.500]  We get activated charcoal,
[02:43:46.500 --> 02:43:47.500]  basically.
[02:43:47.500 --> 02:43:48.500]  That's what biochar is.
[02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:50.500]  And so most of you know the
[02:43:50.500 --> 02:43:51.500]  importance of that in soil
[02:43:51.500 --> 02:43:52.500]  application.
[02:43:52.500 --> 02:43:54.500]  Same thing in hydroponics.
[02:43:54.500 --> 02:43:55.500]  It's got porosity.
[02:43:55.500 --> 02:43:57.500]  It allows an aquaponics
[02:43:57.500 --> 02:43:59.500]  systems, especially surface
[02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:01.500]  area for microbes to exist.
[02:44:02.500 --> 02:44:03.500]  And it can act as a sponge.
[02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:05.500]  It's actually hold on to
[02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:06.500]  nutrients.
[02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:07.500]  It's a good thing.
[02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:08.500]  It's a good thing.
[02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:09.500]  It's a good thing.
[02:44:09.500 --> 02:44:10.500]  It's a good thing.
[02:44:10.500 --> 02:44:11.500]  It's a good thing.
[02:44:12.500 --> 02:44:13.500]  it's back scpatient hold on
[02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:14.500]  to nutrients, so they're
[02:44:14.500 --> 02:44:15.500]  available later for plants to
[02:44:15.500 --> 02:44:16.500]  use.
[02:44:16.500 --> 02:44:17.500]  What Nick Savadov is doing a
[02:44:17.500 --> 02:44:19.500]  lot of is using biochar
[02:44:20.500 --> 02:44:21.500]  is the filtration media
[02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:24.500]  for Ross System,
[02:44:24.500 --> 02:44:26.500]  a recirculating fish
[02:44:26.500 --> 02:44:27.500]  system.
[02:44:27.500 --> 02:44:28.500]  You have to have solids
[02:44:28.500 --> 02:44:29.500]  removal.
[02:44:29.500 --> 02:44:31.500]  He's using biochar as
[02:44:31.500 --> 02:44:32.500]  a polishing filter.
[02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:34.500]  It removes things to I think
[02:44:34.500 --> 02:44:36.500]  like 200 microns,
[02:44:36.500 --> 02:44:38.500]  polishes it really nicely.
[02:44:38.500 --> 02:44:39.500]  And now you can send that
[02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:40.500]  water out to your
[02:44:40.500 --> 02:44:45.340]  bed. So if you're thinking about aquaponics, remember I said solid waste
[02:44:45.340 --> 02:44:50.620]  management is one of the biggest reasons people fail. Consider solids management
[02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:55.740]  and consider your biochar filter as a final polishing filter. And honestly, if
[02:44:55.740 --> 02:45:00.900]  you're using it as a biofilter or a solids filter like that, periodically
[02:45:00.900 --> 02:45:05.580]  you can take that solids filter that's been charged full of nutrients from your
[02:45:05.580 --> 02:45:10.860]  fish water and sell it. You sell that as charged biochar. It's a very value-added
[02:45:10.860 --> 02:45:16.500]  product now. So there's a lot of angles to get back into biochar from
[02:45:16.500 --> 02:45:22.220]  the fish and plant side of things. I don't want to interrupt, but there's
[02:45:22.220 --> 02:45:29.900]  one thing that I really want you to look into. The reason fish brew can create a
[02:45:29.900 --> 02:45:35.900]  shelf-stable, living, liquid, biological inoculum is because of these
[02:45:35.900 --> 02:45:41.900]  microorganisms called diatoms. So he's got such a high level of diatom in the
[02:45:41.900 --> 02:45:46.940]  product that it's shelf-stable. I worked for years in trying to figure that out.
[02:45:46.940 --> 02:45:52.060]  Are they potentially consuming those biologically active microbes
[02:45:52.060 --> 02:45:58.380]  that are still active? No, no, no. They're producing oxygen. They can take the
[02:45:58.380 --> 02:46:03.980]  minerals out of the water, and their discharge is oxygen. So it's like an EM.
[02:46:03.980 --> 02:46:08.260]  It's exactly like an EM. Everything is just staying active because there's
[02:46:08.260 --> 02:46:12.100]  someone else taking the waste and converting it into a product that they
[02:46:12.100 --> 02:46:18.460]  can consume. So it was one of the most interesting accomplishments.
[02:46:18.460 --> 02:46:23.540]  When Keith – I've known – you've known Keith. You've known him forever, too. So
[02:46:23.940 --> 02:46:31.900]  when he first bought that farm in Cape Cod – actually, before he even closed on it,
[02:46:31.900 --> 02:46:36.420]  he got me to go down and look at it. We collected some solids that I found
[02:46:36.420 --> 02:46:40.340]  caught in the corner because it's a flow-through. I put it under the
[02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:44.980]  microscope. I'm like, oh, my God, dude. You have diatoms. This is a game-changer.
[02:46:44.980 --> 02:46:52.420]  I mean, bottom line was getting a product out with protozoa was
[02:46:52.420 --> 02:46:56.540]  groundbreaking at the time. The only way I could get it out to people in a
[02:46:56.540 --> 02:47:01.980]  shelf-stable way was to dewater it to a point where I had reduced the level of
[02:47:01.980 --> 02:47:07.340]  water to less than 40 percent, fluffed it up, put everything to sleep – no pH – just
[02:47:07.340 --> 02:47:11.340]  put everything to sleep. I could put it solid in a bucket. I've got
[02:47:11.340 --> 02:47:16.380]  stuff here that's from 2011 that still is good, if not better, than it was when
[02:47:16.380 --> 02:47:20.780]  it was created. So there's two ways to stabilize these organisms. But you can't –
[02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:24.620]  it's very difficult to do it in water. I couldn't do it. But then Keith bought
[02:47:24.620 --> 02:47:28.980]  this farm and then realized, oh, my God, if I collect enough of these diatoms in
[02:47:28.980 --> 02:47:35.100]  the fish manure, then I basically created an oxygen pump and therefore shelf
[02:47:35.100 --> 02:47:39.060]  stability. So that's something that you probably ought to start looking into is
[02:47:39.060 --> 02:47:43.020]  a better understanding of diatoms because I think Santa Fe – I think you
[02:47:43.020 --> 02:47:52.140]  could create a diatom bioreactor that produced them using Keith's stuff as a
[02:47:52.140 --> 02:47:59.060]  startup. That's great. As I mentioned, we're a playground and a testbed for
[02:47:59.060 --> 02:48:03.380]  this kind of work. Anybody interested in public-private partnerships can get in
[02:48:03.380 --> 02:48:07.140]  touch with me. We can make these kind of research things happen. We have
[02:48:07.140 --> 02:48:11.980]  space. We have land. We have fish waste. And that's, again, since I met Leighton,
[02:48:11.980 --> 02:48:16.620]  he's kind of understood that magic. And so he's gone around looking for fish
[02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:22.540]  farmers. He has a solution to their problem. So as we eat more fish and you
[02:48:22.540 --> 02:48:27.820]  see more fish farming in America around you, you have a solution as a soil
[02:48:27.820 --> 02:48:33.700]  designer. You all are trying to create inoculums and beneficial products, many
[02:48:33.700 --> 02:48:38.300]  of you. Find the fish farmers in your area. Help them. Tell them you'll take
[02:48:38.300 --> 02:48:41.980]  their waste. They're probably paying to get rid of their waste still. And you all
[02:48:41.980 --> 02:48:46.260]  have that free resource. Let me just finish real quick my kind of flow
[02:48:46.260 --> 02:48:51.580]  through. From Canada, I went to Texas. An old student of mine had a successful
[02:48:51.580 --> 02:48:55.500]  farm. And you all should could look up information on this farm. It's called
[02:48:55.500 --> 02:49:01.300]  Lily Pad Farm. And they were involved in a paper that you can find. If you just
[02:49:01.300 --> 02:49:07.940]  search for economic analysis of aquaponics, you'll find a paper out of
[02:49:07.940 --> 02:49:12.620]  Kentucky. And they analyzed three farms economically. They analyzed the UVI
[02:49:12.620 --> 02:49:19.500]  system. They analyzed my farm, Lily Pad Farm. And they analyzed Trader Hill down
[02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:25.740]  in Florida. My issue on that analysis is they were all subtropical regions. None
[02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:30.020]  of us had a greenhouse to run. None of us had heating bills. We didn't have
[02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:34.220]  cooling bills. We didn't have any lighting bills. So again, that's why I
[02:49:34.220 --> 02:49:37.900]  think the jury is still out when we're running in Canada and we're running in
[02:49:37.900 --> 02:49:42.460]  northern climates, anywhere above the Mason-Dixon line. We got to throw a lot
[02:49:42.460 --> 02:49:47.460]  of light. And that's a big economic consideration. I learned a lot there
[02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:53.980]  about partnerships. That's a soft skill that I bring to my students now, how
[02:49:53.980 --> 02:49:58.980]  important partnerships are and communication. So I basically say that my
[02:49:58.980 --> 02:50:04.780]  partnership just wasn't a good fit. So I lasted about a year. The idea was I
[02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:08.500]  would run the farm. My partner would run the business. But there were some
[02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:12.300]  health issues involved. And I ran a perfect farm. The business just didn't
[02:50:12.300 --> 02:50:17.260]  launch like we expected it to. So Santa Fe Community College was really starting
[02:50:17.260 --> 02:50:22.220]  to expand. They got money to build this new facility that I erected. And they
[02:50:22.220 --> 02:50:27.660]  basically recruited me. When I came in on my drive home, I got the offer, came
[02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:31.820]  back two weeks later and started this program. Six years ago, I started it.
[02:50:31.980 --> 02:50:37.940]  Before that, I had over 20 years experience as research, extension and
[02:50:37.940 --> 02:50:45.820]  teaching intensives. People for 15 years of my career paid $1,500 a week to sit
[02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:51.060]  on a course. We just gave everybody three hours for free. And there's a lot,
[02:50:51.060 --> 02:50:54.140]  like you said, I can't remember what you keep putting up there, but that's a gold
[02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:58.580]  nugget. And that's a nut and bolt. I like to give the information that's really
[02:50:58.580 --> 02:51:05.580]  practical. Pure gold. Exactly. So people used to pay $1,500. Not hesitate. When I
[02:51:05.580 --> 02:51:11.380]  started doing that at UVI, our first class, we had 15 people. Our last class
[02:51:11.380 --> 02:51:19.660]  before I left and Jim Ricosi left, 92 people paid $1,500, flew to the Caribbean,
[02:51:19.780 --> 02:51:25.660]  had lodging bills, food bills. They invested a lot because we could cut to
[02:51:25.660 --> 02:51:29.980]  the chase. And as I mentioned in the very beginning here, I've talked more
[02:51:29.980 --> 02:51:34.660]  people out of doing aquaponics than doing aquaponics. Those people would come
[02:51:34.660 --> 02:51:39.460]  to my workshops and I teach about the realities. This is farming. This is
[02:51:39.500 --> 02:51:44.340]  everyday. This is not just growing plants. Now you got to be a fish farmer.
[02:51:44.540 --> 02:51:48.860]  Everything that goes with that. I'm not just marketing plants and food safety on
[02:51:48.860 --> 02:51:53.500]  plants. I'm marketing fish and food safety on fish. So it got really
[02:51:53.500 --> 02:51:58.780]  complicated really quick. So anyway, Santa Fe Community College is where I am
[02:51:58.780 --> 02:52:04.060]  now. Just last month, the Aquaponic Association Conference, which is an
[02:52:04.060 --> 02:52:10.500]  annual conference, was held in Oklahoma. I gave some talks. My students gave some
[02:52:10.500 --> 02:52:15.140]  talks. We brought a lot of people with us. And they announced that in September
[02:52:15.460 --> 02:52:21.700]  of 2023, next year, the Aquaponic Association Conference will be held in
[02:52:21.700 --> 02:52:25.380]  Santa Fe or we may have it in Albuquerque. But we are going to be the
[02:52:25.380 --> 02:52:30.220]  highlight facility. All the workshops, all the tours will be in my off-grid,
[02:52:30.420 --> 02:52:35.020]  state-of-the-art facility, commercial scale aquaponics, commercial scale
[02:52:35.020 --> 02:52:40.340]  hydroponics, commercial scale algae production. We have a spirulina farm here
[02:52:40.340 --> 02:52:45.540]  on campus. So if you really want to geek out with me and Leighton, I'm
[02:52:45.540 --> 02:52:48.100]  definitely drawing Leighton to that conference because we got other
[02:52:48.100 --> 02:52:52.060]  colleagues that'll be there. This could be our meetup. Okay, I'm going to
[02:52:52.060 --> 02:52:56.060]  hopefully this podcast and this webinar or whatever we're calling it, the
[02:52:56.060 --> 02:53:00.300]  Living Soil Conversations, hopefully we'll keep advertising as we start to
[02:53:00.300 --> 02:53:05.540]  announce the dates, announce the locations, announce the pre-conference
[02:53:05.540 --> 02:53:10.940]  workshops. We would love to see you all. We're trying to broaden it into a food,
[02:53:10.940 --> 02:53:17.180]  energy, water kind of focus. So things that integrate living soils, things that
[02:53:17.180 --> 02:53:22.140]  integrate energy systems. It doesn't have to be specific aquaponics. Let's
[02:53:22.140 --> 02:53:26.260]  broaden this a little bit because we're such a great location to come together,
[02:53:26.460 --> 02:53:30.820]  kind of centrally located in the US. So please stay tuned and Leighton, I assume
[02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:32.340]  you'll help me share that information.
[02:53:33.380 --> 02:53:37.940]  Hell yeah, brother. Hell yeah. We're all about promoting important knowledge. And
[02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:43.100]  it's can-approved. So we're really, I'm going to get blown out on all fucking
[02:53:43.580 --> 02:53:45.580]  Facebook, future cannabis project.
[02:53:47.140 --> 02:53:51.380]  Trying, I'm trying to get it all out there because like this knowledge is
[02:53:51.380 --> 02:53:54.900]  phenomenal. I know when I first started in aquaponics myself, I found the
[02:53:54.900 --> 02:54:02.140]  Leftbridge Research. I've been actually following that research for probably 10,
[02:54:02.140 --> 02:54:08.260]  12 years. It's well, eight years, I would say. Fantastic resource, definitely.
[02:54:08.620 --> 02:54:14.100]  Let me just restate something that Brian and I agree on, is that sometimes people,
[02:54:14.100 --> 02:54:20.100]  listeners, if you're still there, you get stuck in the resources. You get stuck in
[02:54:20.100 --> 02:54:24.420]  following Jim Ricossi and Charlie Schultz. And you get stuck on the internet and
[02:54:24.420 --> 02:54:29.940]  the YouTubes. You got to do it. You got to get your IBC tank and do it. You got to
[02:54:29.940 --> 02:54:34.420]  find some fiberglass troughs. And there is no reason why you don't go to Habitat
[02:54:34.420 --> 02:54:40.540]  for Humanity. There's a lot of those restores. There's a lot of hot tubs
[02:54:40.540 --> 02:54:46.740]  around. Great, great fish tanks. You know, put your fish in a hot tub. And then I
[02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:51.180]  say that aquaponics belongs not only in the hands of the fish farmer, because you
[02:54:51.180 --> 02:54:55.380]  need to have your fish skills, but it also belongs in the hands of the tinker.
[02:54:55.820 --> 02:55:01.420]  People who like to tinker, put stuff together. So a lot of us really like that.
[02:55:01.540 --> 02:55:05.940]  I don't mind taking a sawzall and cutting a two inch pipe and putting in a union and
[02:55:05.940 --> 02:55:09.860]  trying something different. There's a lot of people that are afraid to cut a piece of
[02:55:09.860 --> 02:55:15.780]  PVC. OK, and to glue it, especially, you know, you don't know how to retrofit it.
[02:55:15.980 --> 02:55:20.780]  You just got to do it. You got to fail. In my industry, they say you're not an
[02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:28.500]  aquaculturist until you kill a million fish on the big scale. I know they probably say
[02:55:28.500 --> 02:55:33.100]  the same about a cannabis grower. You're not an official cannabis grower. So you
[02:55:33.100 --> 02:55:38.780]  have harvested, you know, thousands of plants. I see that in my industry. I get often
[02:55:38.780 --> 02:55:43.740]  young kids come into my classes and they already have an ego or some people call it
[02:55:43.740 --> 02:55:47.460]  an egro. Right. That they come into your grow room, that they're the best and they're
[02:55:47.460 --> 02:55:51.500]  going to tell you how to do things. The only way you're going to get that is through
[02:55:51.500 --> 02:55:58.980]  time and service. OK, I have failed miserably before I realized, oh, temperature is
[02:55:58.980 --> 02:56:03.260]  pretty important in my grow room. Things don't grow well when it's 120 in my
[02:56:03.260 --> 02:56:09.180]  greenhouse. And so I start to focus on just not the plant, but the environment. And so
[02:56:09.180 --> 02:56:15.260]  we're we're cultivating a living organism. I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but
[02:56:15.260 --> 02:56:19.660]  you don't just focus on those minutiae things. It's a holistic system that we're
[02:56:19.660 --> 02:56:24.580]  trying to develop. And I think that's where aquaponics kind of blows people's minds.
[02:56:24.580 --> 02:56:30.620]  Sometimes they have the paradigm, the stigma of hydroponics. They think they know all
[02:56:30.620 --> 02:56:35.620]  about. They think they that we dump nutrients out and rechange our nutrient reservoir.
[02:56:35.820 --> 02:56:40.580]  All these kind of things. Aquaponics is such a beautiful concept when it's put together
[02:56:40.580 --> 02:56:45.980]  in a harmonious balance that sometimes I think, why would we decouple these systems?
[02:56:46.660 --> 02:56:51.820]  One of my research friends, and I'll give him credit, Ben's Koons is the last name.
[02:56:51.820 --> 02:56:57.940]  He's the author on some of those European papers. When I started teaching Europe, we
[02:56:57.940 --> 02:57:02.460]  had a social one night and he's like, damn, aquaponics is romantic.
[02:57:02.820 --> 02:57:04.500]  He's like, it is sexy.
[02:57:04.700 --> 02:57:06.340]  It is so happening.
[02:57:06.940 --> 02:57:11.860]  He's like, oh, when is the only time aquaponics is not romantic?
[02:57:12.500 --> 02:57:17.980]  It's when you decouple it, you split it apart, you lose that relationship.
[02:57:18.380 --> 02:57:19.820]  So I'm a purist.
[02:57:20.420 --> 02:57:25.580]  But with that said, two years ago, I wrote a publication here in New Mexico called
[02:57:25.580 --> 02:57:27.260]  Decoupled Aquaponics.
[02:57:27.580 --> 02:57:29.540]  Everybody look for that on the Internet.
[02:57:29.540 --> 02:57:32.940]  Just put decoupled aquaponics in my name and PDF.
[02:57:33.100 --> 02:57:34.940]  It's full of beautiful pictures.
[02:57:35.060 --> 02:57:36.900]  It tells you how I do aerobics.
[02:57:37.780 --> 02:57:42.420]  And it's a it's a glossy cooperative extension publication.
[02:57:42.820 --> 02:57:49.420]  So I still see the rationale, again, food safety, tailoring your nutrients.
[02:57:49.780 --> 02:57:56.780]  I can also grow a cold water fish like a salmon or a trout and warm up those nutrients
[02:57:57.060 --> 02:57:59.220]  and grow tropical vegetables.
[02:57:59.380 --> 02:58:04.180]  So maybe you have a differential in temperature is why you want to decouple.
[02:58:04.380 --> 02:58:06.620]  Let me also I know we have two minutes or so.
[02:58:06.620 --> 02:58:10.820]  Let me just mention some companies up there doing in Canada doing some really good work
[02:58:11.060 --> 02:58:12.660]  with aquaponic cannabis.
[02:58:13.060 --> 02:58:14.460]  Look up Habitat.
[02:58:14.980 --> 02:58:16.980]  Habitat is out of B.C.
[02:58:17.620 --> 02:58:21.740]  Their aquaculture specialist is one of the best in the world, Justin Henry.
[02:58:22.460 --> 02:58:24.260]  They are certified organic.
[02:58:25.020 --> 02:58:29.700]  They do coho salmon, decouple their system and do very small.
[02:58:30.060 --> 02:58:31.780]  They do caviar and cake.
[02:58:31.940 --> 02:58:34.180]  Their weed doesn't even look like weed anymore.
[02:58:34.180 --> 02:58:35.700]  Right. It's all the sugar coated.
[02:58:35.900 --> 02:58:38.580]  Looks like someone did the whole guy covered in powdery mildew.
[02:58:38.780 --> 02:58:39.980]  But it's not right.
[02:58:39.980 --> 02:58:41.300]  So look at that company.
[02:58:41.540 --> 02:58:43.660]  You'll also find out about Green Relief.
[02:58:44.180 --> 02:58:49.380]  They were around Toronto buried underground, a 50 million dollar facility.
[02:58:49.860 --> 02:58:51.500]  I helped work on that facility.
[02:58:51.500 --> 02:58:54.740]  I trained the the the owner initially.
[02:58:55.300 --> 02:58:57.180]  Steve Rassner's done some work with them.
[02:58:57.540 --> 02:58:59.660]  I heard recently they're out of business.
[02:59:00.580 --> 02:59:06.980]  Veritas is a new company that's really professional and you can find a lot on the Internet.
[02:59:07.820 --> 02:59:10.380]  There's a virtual aquaponic cannabis conference.
[02:59:10.380 --> 02:59:14.340]  I don't know if we're supposed to promote everybody's stuff, but that stuff's still up on YouTube.
[02:59:14.660 --> 02:59:19.180]  There's two years in a row of virtual aquaponic cannabis conference.
[02:59:19.500 --> 02:59:21.860]  That's like 18 hours of free information.
[02:59:22.660 --> 02:59:23.860]  So, again, I'm out of business.
[02:59:23.860 --> 02:59:25.620]  I'm not saying anything.
[02:59:26.340 --> 02:59:27.500]  I'll give you knowledge.
[02:59:27.500 --> 02:59:28.500]  OK, that's what we do.
[02:59:28.980 --> 02:59:30.860]  So I'm glad you guys found me.
[02:59:31.140 --> 02:59:33.100]  And it's been a long time coming.
[02:59:34.100 --> 02:59:36.740]  I appreciate some of the other speakers I got to look.
[02:59:36.940 --> 02:59:39.340]  You all have a great resource with this website.
[02:59:39.660 --> 02:59:40.900]  You've got these speakers up there.
[02:59:40.900 --> 02:59:43.540]  It's archived. A lot of content on here.
[02:59:43.740 --> 02:59:45.300]  So I'm looking forward to digging into that.
[02:59:46.660 --> 02:59:51.340]  Well, you're going to be back, Charlie, because there's there's so much more.
[02:59:51.620 --> 02:59:53.940]  We just scratched the fucking surface on this.
[02:59:53.980 --> 02:59:55.900]  I think my contacts are down below.
[02:59:55.900 --> 02:59:57.380]  I think Ken put that together.
[02:59:58.340 --> 03:00:01.340]  Short and skinny, if you need me, I'm aquaponics at Hotmail.
[03:00:02.140 --> 03:00:03.580]  That's the easiest way to reach me.
[03:00:05.020 --> 03:00:09.860]  Ken, I know you've got at least 18 questions and I saw there was a bunch that didn't get
[03:00:09.860 --> 03:00:14.820]  starred. So I don't know, Charlie, if you have time to continue and answer some of these
[03:00:14.820 --> 03:00:15.820]  questions really quickly.
[03:00:15.820 --> 03:00:17.500]  You're hoping to keep rolling. Let's go for it.
[03:00:17.500 --> 03:00:19.220]  I forgot to save time for Q&A.
[03:00:19.260 --> 03:00:20.700]  Let's go. Yeah.
[03:00:20.700 --> 03:00:24.420]  Yeah. But be assured, audience, he will be back.
[03:00:24.460 --> 03:00:26.180]  This is a one off.
[03:00:26.180 --> 03:00:30.900]  So probably early in the answer gets too long.
[03:00:30.940 --> 03:00:32.180]  I'll cut it short for next time.
[03:00:32.700 --> 03:00:34.300]  There you go. There you go.
[03:00:34.500 --> 03:00:38.580]  All right. So let's wrap and fire, Ken, and see how far we get to the questions.
[03:00:38.980 --> 03:00:45.100]  And I wanted to mention also stock tanks are you can get them at around that 300
[03:00:45.100 --> 03:00:46.700]  gallons. That's what I was using.
[03:00:46.700 --> 03:00:48.740]  And IBC totes as well.
[03:00:49.500 --> 03:00:54.620]  On a larger scale, as we get into aquaculture, what I find the most economical tanks is
[03:00:54.620 --> 03:00:59.340]  they sell a product. There's a company, Reef Industries, and they sell a product called a
[03:00:59.340 --> 03:01:06.180]  quick tank. It's basically rubber coated mesh wire fencing that comes in a roll.
[03:01:06.260 --> 03:01:08.020]  And when you unroll it, it's a circle.
[03:01:08.540 --> 03:01:10.020]  And then you drop a liner in it.
[03:01:10.220 --> 03:01:13.660]  And I've done 7000, 10,000 gallon tanks like that.
[03:01:13.780 --> 03:01:15.340]  And they're up in two hours.
[03:01:15.940 --> 03:01:16.900]  Sweet.
[03:01:17.220 --> 03:01:19.300]  And they pack in a pallet and ship quickly.
[03:01:19.500 --> 03:01:19.780]  Yeah.
[03:01:20.620 --> 03:01:21.460]  And you can move.
[03:01:22.180 --> 03:01:22.460]  Yeah.
[03:01:22.460 --> 03:01:23.260]  If you need to.
[03:01:23.980 --> 03:01:24.300]  Yeah.
[03:01:25.420 --> 03:01:33.060]  OK, so can you can you simply add a few cups of fish tank water to mesophilic compost to get a
[03:01:33.060 --> 03:01:34.220]  similar result?
[03:01:34.700 --> 03:01:35.580]  Absolutely.
[03:01:36.540 --> 03:01:38.300]  Well, you don't get fish protein.
[03:01:38.940 --> 03:01:42.540]  Well, no, but you're going to get biological growth.
[03:01:42.540 --> 03:01:47.100]  So, yes, if you're looking at a compost, absolutely.
[03:01:47.580 --> 03:01:47.860]  Great.
[03:01:50.100 --> 03:01:56.180]  Now, I know for my own personal curiosity, you're buying your fish food.
[03:01:56.500 --> 03:02:01.460]  Now, I was running across a lot of people that were trying to create their own fish food.
[03:02:02.380 --> 03:02:07.780]  Is that something that you have looked at is instead of having to bring it in to create it
[03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:08.260]  yourself?
[03:02:09.020 --> 03:02:14.340]  Yeah, that's when I talk about the sustainability of aquaponics, that's the one area we can
[03:02:14.340 --> 03:02:20.700]  improve. I try to avoid the word closed loop system, which we are a closed loop system in a
[03:02:20.700 --> 03:02:27.220]  sense. But when you're talking about adding fish feed, taking out cannabis or lettuce, I'm an
[03:02:27.220 --> 03:02:28.180]  input as well.
[03:02:28.180 --> 03:02:33.580]  My energy is not really a closed loop system, but it to close that loop as tight as
[03:02:33.580 --> 03:02:41.220]  possible. I would be looking at the fish food, the resources and the labor involved in being a
[03:02:41.260 --> 03:02:45.420]  fish food manufacturer is another level of complexity.
[03:02:45.860 --> 03:02:49.620]  So not only are we a fish farmer, we're a plant farmer.
[03:02:50.820 --> 03:02:52.900]  Now we're a fish food manufacturer.
[03:02:53.340 --> 03:02:56.820]  You know, a lot of my students want to create their own biological controls.
[03:02:56.820 --> 03:02:59.140]  So they want to be a ladybug farmer.
[03:02:59.660 --> 03:03:02.460]  So things can get very complicated down the line.
[03:03:03.820 --> 03:03:09.540]  Fish feed needs five ingredients, lipids, proteins, carbs, vitamins and minerals.
[03:03:09.700 --> 03:03:15.140]  So to create a diet, you have to know fish nutrition and you have to give a complete diet.
[03:03:15.460 --> 03:03:23.300]  So just feeding earthworms, black soldier fly larvae, duckweed, algae, those are not complete
[03:03:23.300 --> 03:03:25.820]  diets. They may be high in protein.
[03:03:26.020 --> 03:03:29.020]  My spent brewers grain is high in carbohydrates.
[03:03:29.220 --> 03:03:31.300]  So I've done it. We have created diets.
[03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:33.780]  Again, spent brewers grains are great.
[03:03:33.780 --> 03:03:37.740]  The microbrewery trend, there's a lot of waste if you can get access to it.
[03:03:37.980 --> 03:03:39.260]  I grow algae.
[03:03:39.300 --> 03:03:41.180]  So algae is my protein.
[03:03:41.860 --> 03:03:45.620]  I've got my carbs, vitamins and minerals come in a prepack.
[03:03:45.620 --> 03:03:48.100]  So we buy that and we just throw it as an ingredient.
[03:03:48.340 --> 03:03:55.500]  And then lipid source, lipid source, fish eat fish grow so we can eat fish.
[03:03:55.780 --> 03:03:58.540]  Almost every fish eats fish to grow fish.
[03:03:59.180 --> 03:04:01.380]  They need that amino acid profile.
[03:04:01.580 --> 03:04:06.740]  So often in these diets, we use a little bit of fish meal or fish oil to give them what they
[03:04:06.740 --> 03:04:10.180]  need to grow. The problem is people creating their own diet.
[03:04:10.180 --> 03:04:12.500]  They're not complete diets and the fish suffer.
[03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:18.140]  OK, do you have something somewhere where if somebody wanted to do that, they could get a
[03:04:18.140 --> 03:04:22.020]  percentage base on what they do need to put in for their own fish food?
[03:04:22.660 --> 03:04:24.340]  Yeah, there's a website.
[03:04:24.660 --> 03:04:30.180]  S.R.A.C. is the acronym S.R.A.C.
[03:04:30.580 --> 03:04:33.580]  and it stands for the Southern Region Aquaculture Center.
[03:04:33.900 --> 03:04:38.900]  And it's a repository of thousands of publications and they have a whole focus on fish
[03:04:38.900 --> 03:04:41.060]  nutrition and fish diets.
[03:04:41.340 --> 03:04:47.140]  So schools like Kentucky State, there's an area of aquaponics, there's fish genetics, there's
[03:04:47.140 --> 03:04:50.740]  fish nutrition, there's anatomy and physiology of fish.
[03:04:51.020 --> 03:04:55.500]  And so the fish nutrition area is an incredible field to study.
[03:04:55.820 --> 03:05:01.300]  So getting into can we feed the fish and maybe feed them a certain phosphorus ingredient?
[03:05:01.300 --> 03:05:05.580]  So they're actually excreting dissolved phosphorus that really makes my plants boost.
[03:05:06.340 --> 03:05:09.220]  I don't know. There's a trend to do that.
[03:05:09.460 --> 03:05:13.220]  I don't know if that's better or just supplement your water with the phosphorus that the
[03:05:13.220 --> 03:05:16.340]  plants need. Why do we need to go through the fish in that aspect?
[03:05:16.740 --> 03:05:20.860]  Again, I do fish because I grow fish for protein, for humanity.
[03:05:21.260 --> 03:05:24.820]  We just turned the link to eight billion people.
[03:05:25.140 --> 03:05:26.700]  We've got to feed people.
[03:05:27.300 --> 03:05:31.980]  If you're not interested in food, fish, we can go ornamental fish or we could just start
[03:05:31.980 --> 03:05:35.780]  making teas again out of worms, out of chicken manure.
[03:05:35.780 --> 03:05:39.500]  A lot of the stuff that we're talking, compost teas, that's viable.
[03:05:39.740 --> 03:05:45.620]  What I found in my 30 years is to do that consistently at scale.
[03:05:45.940 --> 03:05:47.260]  Aquaponics is the way.
[03:05:48.020 --> 03:05:53.900]  Teas vary depending on what you feed the worms or what your compost this week versus next.
[03:05:54.460 --> 03:05:57.260]  Aquaponics, that's the same ingredient every day.
[03:05:58.540 --> 03:05:59.820]  Now you got me talking again.
[03:06:02.300 --> 03:06:03.300]  You don't mind.
[03:06:05.300 --> 03:06:07.540]  I don't think Brian said two words today.
[03:06:09.780 --> 03:06:14.500]  Hey, before he came on, when I was waiting for you to pop on, I shared that with him.
[03:06:14.500 --> 03:06:15.740]  I said, I'm learning today.
[03:06:16.580 --> 03:06:17.660]  Yeah, I appreciate.
[03:06:18.220 --> 03:06:19.220]  I miss talking to you.
[03:06:19.220 --> 03:06:22.420]  Something else you talked about, Charlie, real quick, and I don't think a lot of people
[03:06:22.420 --> 03:06:28.540]  mention that in the cannabis space is, you do go to some of these classes, you're there
[03:06:28.540 --> 03:06:30.300]  for maybe a week, like you had mentioned.
[03:06:30.580 --> 03:06:37.660]  And I think then if you're trying to think of more of like a secular type structure, the
[03:06:37.660 --> 03:06:42.500]  issue is that I found even with the commercial side, when we were in charge of things is
[03:06:42.780 --> 03:06:47.580]  people that try to come up, it's almost like if you're a bartender, you're a busboy.
[03:06:47.580 --> 03:06:50.300]  Right. If you're in the cannabis game, you're usually trimming.
[03:06:50.340 --> 03:06:51.140]  That's the first thing.
[03:06:51.580 --> 03:06:56.420]  But those individuals have never experienced the stress of managing a system when it's not
[03:06:56.420 --> 03:06:59.540]  working well. So like sometimes when that stuff happens.
[03:06:59.540 --> 03:07:03.820]  So I think that was a huge gold bar that you had mentioned.
[03:07:03.820 --> 03:07:08.660]  We went over it and I just wanted to highlight it because if you can train your team from
[03:07:08.660 --> 03:07:13.100]  day one to start to really understand that shit is going to happen, like, you know, we're
[03:07:13.100 --> 03:07:15.460]  not failing as a team, that kind of stuff.
[03:07:15.580 --> 03:07:17.300]  How do we manage stress?
[03:07:17.300 --> 03:07:19.500]  How do we manage things that are happening in our grows?
[03:07:20.220 --> 03:07:21.420]  So I just wanted to highlight that.
[03:07:21.700 --> 03:07:24.900]  Great. And it kind of leads back into me being open source.
[03:07:24.900 --> 03:07:32.140]  I'm not selling my students a system that maybe has a design method that I kind of keep
[03:07:32.140 --> 03:07:36.420]  proprietary. I try to teach the components of an aquaponic system.
[03:07:36.700 --> 03:07:37.820]  You need a fish tank.
[03:07:38.060 --> 03:07:40.140]  You need solids removal devices.
[03:07:40.380 --> 03:07:44.220]  You may have another space for polishing the solids like a biochar.
[03:07:44.460 --> 03:07:48.700]  You may have a biofilter where you have media that's there for surface area.
[03:07:48.940 --> 03:07:52.980]  Then you have a plant bed and it can be ebb and flow and it can be DWC.
[03:07:53.180 --> 03:07:55.460]  We can filter it and do nutrient film technique.
[03:07:55.460 --> 03:07:56.580]  I could do Dutch buckets.
[03:07:56.820 --> 03:08:00.220]  And then we loop that around and return it to the fish.
[03:08:00.420 --> 03:08:06.980]  So I teach the components and I'm really teaching you to build your own system and come up
[03:08:06.980 --> 03:08:11.540]  with some works. And if it doesn't work, like you're saying, you know why, you know what
[03:08:11.540 --> 03:08:12.580]  to do to fix it.
[03:08:13.300 --> 03:08:19.100]  I like to say that there's millions of designs out there and I can walk in and operate
[03:08:19.100 --> 03:08:20.300]  anybody's system.
[03:08:20.980 --> 03:08:24.860]  I get a lot of calls, I bought this system from this company and it's miserable.
[03:08:25.180 --> 03:08:26.700]  I can walk in and make it work.
[03:08:27.100 --> 03:08:31.620]  I know then to slow down maybe on the feed rate, reduce some of the plant bed.
[03:08:31.620 --> 03:08:33.620]  Maybe it's not sized properly.
[03:08:33.900 --> 03:08:39.340]  So if you know the basic knowledge of what we're doing here, then you can make things
[03:08:39.340 --> 03:08:42.380]  work. It's the same in any industry like that.
[03:08:42.580 --> 03:08:44.180]  So I teach diversity.
[03:08:44.180 --> 03:08:45.820]  My students have to learn.
[03:08:46.300 --> 03:08:53.780]  And we have examples of slab culture, ebb and flow, DWC, Dutch buckets, you name it,
[03:08:53.780 --> 03:08:57.300]  vertical towers. They have to be exposed to everything in the industry.
[03:08:57.420 --> 03:09:00.300]  And that's the goal is that you can go in there and fix it.
[03:09:01.060 --> 03:09:06.780]  My mantra is to have a backup and a backup to the backup and a backup to the backup to
[03:09:06.780 --> 03:09:11.860]  the backup. Every one of my students knows that you've got to have that in place because
[03:09:11.900 --> 03:09:13.540]  as Brian said, things happen.
[03:09:13.900 --> 03:09:18.380]  I also teach them that they never happen nine to five Monday through Friday.
[03:09:18.900 --> 03:09:22.620]  They always happen on Super Sunday or when your daughter's getting married.
[03:09:23.100 --> 03:09:28.420]  Always, reliably, it never happens when you're there.
[03:09:28.740 --> 03:09:29.420]  Students.
[03:09:30.980 --> 03:09:34.740]  So, you know, again, let's say it's good.
[03:09:34.780 --> 03:09:41.780]  Something else that need to be stressed is that, Charlie, you're teaching general
[03:09:41.780 --> 03:09:45.980]  contracting. In general contracting, you need to know electricity.
[03:09:46.180 --> 03:09:50.580]  You need to know how it works, where it should be, how it should be installed.
[03:09:50.940 --> 03:09:54.380]  If you don't, you're going to have a problem and shit's going to get ripped out after you
[03:09:54.380 --> 03:09:55.980]  finished it. That's a real problem.
[03:09:56.420 --> 03:09:59.980]  Same with the plumbing, same with the foundation, same with the roofing, same with the
[03:09:59.980 --> 03:10:01.420]  siding, same with the cabinets.
[03:10:01.420 --> 03:10:08.380]  All aspects of that building, you need to know enough to understand if the person you
[03:10:08.380 --> 03:10:12.900]  hired is doing the right job or not, because if you as a general contractor are
[03:10:12.900 --> 03:10:17.740]  financially responsible to deliver the end product to the client.
[03:10:17.780 --> 03:10:21.500]  So Charlie is a general contractor.
[03:10:21.540 --> 03:10:27.140]  He's teaching you all aspects of the components so that you can fix shit when it goes
[03:10:27.140 --> 03:10:30.180]  sideways on Super Bowl Sunday with no resources.
[03:10:31.740 --> 03:10:35.660]  And we don't have to be licensed and bonded to do all that.
[03:10:35.700 --> 03:10:37.860]  It's hands on experience.
[03:10:37.900 --> 03:10:42.540]  It's that jack of all trades is what really makes a successful aquaponic farmer.
[03:10:42.820 --> 03:10:44.700]  And that's why I went through within my program.
[03:10:44.700 --> 03:10:50.660]  The electives are things like alternative fuels, algae production, plumbing, hydronics,
[03:10:50.860 --> 03:10:53.380]  solar, you know, welding's right down the hall.
[03:10:53.420 --> 03:10:56.820]  Let students take that as electives because they're going to be welding grow beds
[03:10:56.820 --> 03:11:01.260]  together. If they're doing farm to table, they take fundamentals of culinary.
[03:11:01.620 --> 03:11:05.900]  A lot of my students take Adobe building because I say, really, it's kind of senseless to
[03:11:05.900 --> 03:11:09.540]  put your fish in the greenhouse because the plants need the sunlight.
[03:11:09.900 --> 03:11:12.820]  So do an Adobe insulated building for your fish.
[03:11:13.060 --> 03:11:16.220]  Pump the water back to the greenhouse and back.
[03:11:16.780 --> 03:11:19.700]  So there's a wide variety of classes.
[03:11:19.700 --> 03:11:24.780]  My students become very employable because of all those add ons that you're mentioning.
[03:11:24.980 --> 03:11:25.980]  You have to be.
[03:11:26.300 --> 03:11:29.740]  I didn't ever think I would be an electrician and a plumber and all this stuff.
[03:11:30.500 --> 03:11:34.340]  I could never be a finishing carpenter.
[03:11:34.500 --> 03:11:39.180]  I don't have attention for detail, but I can cut a two inch pipe and put on a union and
[03:11:39.340 --> 03:11:40.540]  and flow the water.
[03:11:41.180 --> 03:11:42.380]  It's those basic skills.
[03:11:42.380 --> 03:11:45.020]  You can't leave the facility until they're fixed.
[03:11:45.820 --> 03:11:47.460]  Yeah, you've got to be responsive.
[03:11:47.900 --> 03:11:49.380]  A jack of all trades.
[03:11:49.460 --> 03:11:51.060]  That's it. Seven days a week.
[03:11:51.060 --> 03:11:54.420]  And I have somebody here breakfast, lunch and dinner shifts.
[03:11:54.660 --> 03:12:00.380]  If you've ever run an NFT system, you know that you got about a one hour window if
[03:12:00.380 --> 03:12:03.380]  power goes out and that little channel doesn't get drips of water.
[03:12:04.220 --> 03:12:06.580]  So three times a day, seven days a week.
[03:12:07.380 --> 03:12:11.100]  Yeah. So we'll go back to a question here.
[03:12:12.380 --> 03:12:16.540]  And guys, Brian had to go pick up his son, so he had to bounce just to let you know.
[03:12:17.500 --> 03:12:21.860]  So what kind of fish food ingredients should be avoided?
[03:12:22.860 --> 03:12:27.060]  Anything with heavy metals, in my opinion, anything unknown.
[03:12:28.060 --> 03:12:34.340]  There's a big trend. I hear Steve Rassner caution you all about adding kelp products
[03:12:35.020 --> 03:12:36.740]  unknowingly to your system.
[03:12:37.380 --> 03:12:40.140]  There's a lot of kelp out there.
[03:12:40.380 --> 03:12:44.300]  I think there's been toxins and some pesticides like memes and things.
[03:12:44.580 --> 03:12:47.780]  You've got to be very careful what you're adding to these systems.
[03:12:48.140 --> 03:12:52.300]  The biggest problem I see is people get too anxious and they start adding supplements
[03:12:52.300 --> 03:12:55.140]  willy nilly. They add worm tea.
[03:12:55.540 --> 03:12:57.980]  And somebody asked me about adding worm tea recently.
[03:12:58.380 --> 03:13:00.820]  And as a student, I looked at him and I said, why?
[03:13:02.620 --> 03:13:04.740]  Well, I don't know. I heard you should.
[03:13:05.100 --> 03:13:06.580]  And I said, look at the plants.
[03:13:06.940 --> 03:13:09.180]  You're standing right next to the plants.
[03:13:09.700 --> 03:13:12.060]  I don't see any nutrient deficiencies.
[03:13:12.500 --> 03:13:16.340]  I don't see a millimeter where I could get extra production on this raft.
[03:13:16.820 --> 03:13:20.100]  So why would you just throw something in that you don't know?
[03:13:20.740 --> 03:13:26.060]  If you maybe take a nutrient analysis and paid the twenty five dollars and told me,
[03:13:26.060 --> 03:13:27.180]  here's what I'm adding.
[03:13:27.740 --> 03:13:30.580]  And I may say, well, gosh, why would you add phosphorus?
[03:13:30.820 --> 03:13:34.420]  Because I just took a system analysis and our phosphorus is off the charts.
[03:13:34.820 --> 03:13:37.900]  So you start throwing in amendments that you don't know.
[03:13:38.220 --> 03:13:41.460]  You're going to start getting your nutrient profiles out of whack.
[03:13:41.940 --> 03:13:46.900]  Now, a hydroponic grower is going to look at Mulder's chart and the relationships of
[03:13:46.900 --> 03:13:52.500]  nutrients to each other, those ratios of cow to mag to potassium and try to keep them
[03:13:52.500 --> 03:13:54.020]  all in the right ratios.
[03:13:54.220 --> 03:13:56.860]  And with nutrient salts and hydroponics, we can do that.
[03:13:57.220 --> 03:14:03.100]  If I get analysis back from aquaponics, I don't necessarily go for the same
[03:14:03.100 --> 03:14:04.300]  recommendations.
[03:14:04.580 --> 03:14:10.820]  If I see that I'm very close, I don't care if I'm seeing I'm very far out of line,
[03:14:10.980 --> 03:14:15.340]  maybe I'll make some supplements that can bring things back in line.
[03:14:15.820 --> 03:14:18.980]  Most fish are tolerant of hydroponic nutrients.
[03:14:19.340 --> 03:14:23.260]  So we could be putting nutrients in there if you want to.
[03:14:23.580 --> 03:14:29.980]  I can tell you in 30 years experience, I have rarely added supplements beyond iron,
[03:14:30.180 --> 03:14:31.940]  calcium and potassium.
[03:14:32.780 --> 03:14:40.380]  I do see analysis at times that say I'm extremely low and maybe molybdenum, possibly
[03:14:40.380 --> 03:14:46.220]  boron. But I look at my plants and they're not showing me any issues with those
[03:14:46.220 --> 03:14:51.100]  nutrients, because I think the little bit that we're putting in every day is being
[03:14:51.100 --> 03:14:52.380]  consumed every day.
[03:14:52.740 --> 03:14:54.980]  So it's not like they're always at zero.
[03:14:55.220 --> 03:14:58.860]  They're always getting that micronutrient level supply that they need.
[03:14:59.380 --> 03:15:02.100]  I'm not saying also that I'm against it.
[03:15:02.700 --> 03:15:08.380]  I'm OK if you know you're at zero, you know that, hey, let me try it and it works,
[03:15:08.540 --> 03:15:11.220]  then maybe that's your new regime to add a little boron.
[03:15:11.500 --> 03:15:16.980]  And by understanding hydroponic nutrient chemistry, it can help an aquaponic grower.
[03:15:17.220 --> 03:15:20.700]  And that's why my program teaches students both.
[03:15:20.700 --> 03:15:27.060]  You've got to know all the hydro chemistry and you learn all the aquaponic organic
[03:15:27.060 --> 03:15:29.940]  chemistry and all the soil food web.
[03:15:29.940 --> 03:15:34.180]  So it's very integrated and it does apply to a lot of fields.
[03:15:34.180 --> 03:15:36.340]  And my students can be launched in a lot of ways.
[03:15:38.820 --> 03:15:40.220]  Well, that's fantastic.
[03:15:40.540 --> 03:15:45.420]  Diversity is key in a lot of this because you have to have the overall knowledge to
[03:15:45.420 --> 03:15:47.980]  understand what's happening at this specific level.
[03:15:48.780 --> 03:15:54.260]  Absolutely. Let me add also something that I try to avoid is sodium.
[03:15:54.820 --> 03:15:57.180]  So I look closely at my source water.
[03:15:57.180 --> 03:16:00.980]  I always pay the twenty five dollars to know what's in my source water.
[03:16:01.140 --> 03:16:05.380]  And we all know that it's often calcium and magnesium and we get scale all over our
[03:16:05.380 --> 03:16:06.700]  emitters and that kind of stuff.
[03:16:07.180 --> 03:16:12.100]  Well, your source water may have sodium in an aquaponic system, unlike hydroponics,
[03:16:12.100 --> 03:16:16.780]  where we do occasionally dump the reservoir and start over where that tight loop
[03:16:16.780 --> 03:16:22.060]  system. And so if I add a little bit of sodium, every one percent I top off.
[03:16:22.420 --> 03:16:26.100]  Well, tomorrow I add a little bit of sodium and add a little bit of sodium.
[03:16:26.380 --> 03:16:30.740]  And when I look at a complete analysis, I'm starting to see sodium add up.
[03:16:31.380 --> 03:16:32.820]  And what's the solution?
[03:16:32.820 --> 03:16:34.540]  I don't I'm not sure yet.
[03:16:34.540 --> 03:16:38.020]  It's a it's a tight system, closed loop, if we want to call it.
[03:16:38.900 --> 03:16:40.580]  So I don't know what's the solution.
[03:16:40.620 --> 03:16:42.220]  I don't want to dump water.
[03:16:42.420 --> 03:16:46.980]  I don't want to do a dilution to get rid of sodium because I'll throw away all those
[03:16:46.980 --> 03:16:49.740]  other 13 essential elements that are beneficial.
[03:16:50.780 --> 03:16:53.900]  So what I did recently was research some halophytes.
[03:16:54.220 --> 03:16:57.820]  And I understand that kale can potentially take up some sodium.
[03:16:58.260 --> 03:16:59.980]  Chive has the ability to.
[03:16:59.980 --> 03:17:02.060]  There's some other plants that are salt tolerant.
[03:17:02.420 --> 03:17:09.180]  And so this semester I converted my large aquaponic systems to at least 50 percent
[03:17:09.180 --> 03:17:10.260]  kale production.
[03:17:10.700 --> 03:17:12.540]  And they are constantly pulling up.
[03:17:12.540 --> 03:17:16.300]  We're doing the every two week harvesting huge amounts of kale.
[03:17:16.500 --> 03:17:19.500]  Come back two weeks later, harvesting huge amounts of kale.
[03:17:20.060 --> 03:17:22.060]  And they're supposedly pulling up my sodium.
[03:17:22.700 --> 03:17:27.460]  The only way to know is to send another analysis out and then I'll find out.
[03:17:27.740 --> 03:17:30.980]  So that question was good about amendments that you want to avoid.
[03:17:31.340 --> 03:17:37.380]  You want to avoid unknown inputs and you need to look at your source water to make sure
[03:17:37.380 --> 03:17:39.540]  you're not continuing to put things in.
[03:17:40.140 --> 03:17:42.740]  Being careful with metals like zinc and such.
[03:17:43.060 --> 03:17:48.220]  Make sure you don't have your zinc exposed gutters dropping in or using water that was
[03:17:48.220 --> 03:17:50.900]  collected off a galvanized roots can be dangerous.
[03:17:51.260 --> 03:17:53.860]  So source water amendments can be dangerous as well.
[03:17:55.380 --> 03:18:00.260]  Well, I know. And there had been a question actually on on the water and your first
[03:18:00.260 --> 03:18:02.900]  system, you say you had captured the rainwater.
[03:18:03.300 --> 03:18:08.860]  So your recommendation, if somebody is starting a new system, is to send in the analysis
[03:18:08.900 --> 03:18:10.580]  to make sure your water is clean.
[03:18:11.340 --> 03:18:14.900]  Yeah, if I was using rainwater, I wouldn't worry about the analysis.
[03:18:14.900 --> 03:18:18.700]  It'd be minor nutrients that are coming in with the dust or off your collection.
[03:18:19.580 --> 03:18:21.300]  But well water, absolutely.
[03:18:21.300 --> 03:18:22.900]  It's going to vary so much.
[03:18:24.060 --> 03:18:29.060]  Again, some people, their well water is higher EC than my system water.
[03:18:29.700 --> 03:18:33.500]  And a lot of that is unwanted in my area as well.
[03:18:33.500 --> 03:18:36.300]  I mean, we have arsenic, we have uranium.
[03:18:36.340 --> 03:18:38.620]  This is New Mexico, the home of the nuclear bomb.
[03:18:39.180 --> 03:18:41.020]  That stuff is scattered everywhere.
[03:18:41.580 --> 03:18:44.380]  So I'm concerned even on those things with my city water.
[03:18:44.660 --> 03:18:51.260]  I had a student to look to rent space in a commercial greenhouse facility here in Santa
[03:18:51.260 --> 03:18:54.580]  Fe. She took my advice and took a water sample.
[03:18:54.940 --> 03:18:58.740]  So she ran the city water that was being delivered into the greenhouse.
[03:18:59.060 --> 03:19:03.500]  She opens the spigot, lets it run for a good five minutes, capture your sample.
[03:19:03.780 --> 03:19:09.780]  She sent it away and it had over the EPA legal levels of lead.
[03:19:10.180 --> 03:19:12.940]  So we're talking Flint, Michigan stuff here.
[03:19:13.220 --> 03:19:18.300]  City water being delivered into businesses with elevated levels of lead.
[03:19:19.140 --> 03:19:23.500]  So her answer, she was like, oh, God, I'm so thankful that I did that.
[03:19:23.780 --> 03:19:28.660]  So I'll just have to get a RO unit and treat this water through a reverse osmosis.
[03:19:28.660 --> 03:19:29.780]  So I have clean water.
[03:19:30.180 --> 03:19:32.740]  And I said, you know, that will give you clean water.
[03:19:33.260 --> 03:19:39.700]  But what else it gives you is highly concentrated lead poisoned water as your discharge.
[03:19:40.020 --> 03:19:45.660]  And as a girl renting the facility, she would have to pay the discharge of hazardous waste
[03:19:45.900 --> 03:19:47.420]  from her RO discharge.
[03:19:47.780 --> 03:19:51.260]  So we got to be very careful with source water coming in.
[03:19:51.260 --> 03:19:53.900]  Chlorine, obviously be careful with that amendment.
[03:19:54.460 --> 03:19:58.900]  It is an essential plant nutrient at a micro level, but it will kill fish quickly.
[03:19:59.300 --> 03:20:01.740]  So make sure you dechlorinated your water.
[03:20:02.380 --> 03:20:06.380]  Every one of you probably have high alkalinity, high pH water.
[03:20:07.100 --> 03:20:10.060]  I told you we like to run our systems at six point four.
[03:20:10.500 --> 03:20:17.620]  So I am diligent about pre treating source water with acid to burn off all that alkalinity
[03:20:17.900 --> 03:20:21.780]  and get my pH down where I want it to be before I put it in my system.
[03:20:22.100 --> 03:20:26.220]  I don't want to add and top off my system and it jacks up to eight point.
[03:20:26.220 --> 03:20:27.900]  Oh, plants don't want that.
[03:20:28.140 --> 03:20:33.460]  So I pre treat the water, my source water before I add it to my system.
[03:20:35.220 --> 03:20:41.220]  Another amendment that I have to convince fish farmers to get away from is baking soda.
[03:20:41.740 --> 03:20:45.180]  I mentioned we want a base because the pH always goes down.
[03:20:45.460 --> 03:20:49.740]  I want a base that has an essential element, calcium or potassium.
[03:20:49.740 --> 03:20:57.140]  Usually I don't want a base that has sodium and that's what baking sodium, baking soda is sodium bicarbonate.
[03:20:57.460 --> 03:21:02.540]  It definitely bumps your pH up, but it adds sodium back to your closed loop system.
[03:21:02.860 --> 03:21:05.020]  So get away from the cheap baking soda.
[03:21:07.740 --> 03:21:08.420]  Fantastic.
[03:21:08.420 --> 03:21:10.380]  Have we even done a question yet?
[03:21:12.540 --> 03:21:16.500]  Well, we've done a couple, but there just keeps more coming in.
[03:21:17.220 --> 03:21:21.580]  I don't know if we want to keep going or we want to just take it up next week.
[03:21:21.580 --> 03:21:21.900]  You know?
[03:21:22.060 --> 03:21:22.460]  All right.
[03:21:22.460 --> 03:21:25.700]  So, so can you store all those questions?
[03:21:26.340 --> 03:21:30.900]  Um, no, I'd actually have to, to write them down.
[03:21:31.020 --> 03:21:39.180]  Um, which I, yeah, I'll, I'll stay on and I'll write them all down and then we can actually bring them up, um, on the next show.
[03:21:39.900 --> 03:21:45.740]  And if anybody has a pressing question and you really do want some advice, um, aquaponics at hotmail.
[03:21:46.100 --> 03:21:47.900]  I don't mind fielding a few questions.
[03:21:47.900 --> 03:21:56.780]  They're making a relationship again, all of us here being in the knowledge business and not trying to dupe you, trying to steer you in the right direction.
[03:21:56.780 --> 03:22:00.740]  Do you hear me dropping name from Elaine Ingham to Jim Mercosi?
[03:22:00.900 --> 03:22:02.860]  I'm not capturing all this myself.
[03:22:02.860 --> 03:22:04.020]  I'm sharing the knowledge.
[03:22:04.380 --> 03:22:06.780]  Um, so we're here to help you again, send me an email.
[03:22:07.140 --> 03:22:13.380]  Um, if it's something pressing, otherwise I'll let these guys kind of announce when I can come back and we'll do it again.
[03:22:14.140 --> 03:22:15.140]  Yeah, for sure.
[03:22:15.300 --> 03:22:15.860]  For sure.
[03:22:15.860 --> 03:22:18.660]  So audience don't stress about your questions.
[03:22:18.660 --> 03:22:28.340]  You've got his email address, hit him up if you're desperate, but I guarantee you each one of those questions is going to lead into another 15, 20 minutes, half an hour minimum.
[03:22:28.940 --> 03:22:34.020]  So, um, again, ideally, yeah, ideally you're not y'all emailing me.
[03:22:34.140 --> 03:22:35.700]  We're going to save the questions here.
[03:22:35.700 --> 03:22:36.860]  We'll revisit this.
[03:22:36.860 --> 03:22:41.140]  And it sounds like you have regular viewers here, so I'm sure I'll see you all again.
[03:22:41.540 --> 03:22:44.060]  Again, thanks everybody for the comments that I'm seeing.
[03:22:44.060 --> 03:22:46.580]  Again, I can't see them all, but I do see a few popping in.
[03:22:46.860 --> 03:22:48.620]  I really appreciate the accolades.
[03:22:48.900 --> 03:22:53.300]  Um, again, if you're looking for the workforce of the future to run your farm, let me know.
[03:22:53.300 --> 03:22:56.260]  I have students that are willing and able to relocate.
[03:22:56.620 --> 03:23:02.900]  I would love for you all to stay apprised of the aquaponic association and come to the conference next year.
[03:23:02.900 --> 03:23:04.620]  And let's really network in person.
[03:23:04.940 --> 03:23:08.060]  And let me show you the proof is in the pudding, right?
[03:23:08.060 --> 03:23:09.620]  I'm going to show you a farm that works.
[03:23:09.620 --> 03:23:11.380]  I'm going to show you what we do with our waste.
[03:23:11.740 --> 03:23:13.540]  I'm going to show you how it all ties together.
[03:23:15.060 --> 03:23:16.460]  Yeah, man.
[03:23:17.540 --> 03:23:18.540]  All right. Fantastic.
[03:23:18.540 --> 03:23:21.020]  Because, you know, Poe's going fucking psycho about now.
[03:23:21.020 --> 03:23:24.420]  He's just like, he's going to start eating me if I don't get him out of here.
[03:23:24.820 --> 03:23:28.700]  And I just got back from Mexico, so I got weeks and weeks of trimming to do.
[03:23:28.700 --> 03:23:33.260]  So thanks for giving me a day off.
[03:23:33.700 --> 03:23:35.420]  I know what I'm doing the rest of the day now.
[03:23:35.660 --> 03:23:36.820]  Awesome. Awesome.
[03:23:36.820 --> 03:23:38.940]  Well, thank you so much for the three hours, brother.
[03:23:39.340 --> 03:23:41.020]  Deep love and respect, as you know.
[03:23:41.340 --> 03:23:44.980]  And I will be in touch about when we can plug you back into the queue.
[03:23:45.340 --> 03:23:47.060]  Great to be with like minded people here.
[03:23:47.060 --> 03:23:49.020]  That's what I really gets me off.
[03:23:49.540 --> 03:23:51.420]  I'm into it all.
[03:23:52.300 --> 03:23:53.460]  I'm out.
[03:23:54.540 --> 03:23:56.540]  And I'm going to get it.
[03:23:57.940 --> 03:24:00.020]  I don't know what you have coming up, Leighton.
[03:24:00.020 --> 03:24:02.180]  I know that you've been working with Gary.
[03:24:02.180 --> 03:24:03.260]  That was one of the things.
[03:24:03.260 --> 03:24:09.620]  Could we use some of that technology with what Charlie is doing?
[03:24:09.620 --> 03:24:11.220]  I don't know where that is.
[03:24:11.220 --> 03:24:13.860]  I'm really curious to know what's going on there.
[03:24:14.140 --> 03:24:15.820]  OK, we have a setback.
[03:24:16.180 --> 03:24:17.700]  The generator did not work.
[03:24:17.700 --> 03:24:20.580]  It took two days for them to finally get the generator up.
[03:24:20.860 --> 03:24:22.860]  We got the biology up and running.
[03:24:22.860 --> 03:24:25.220]  It takes a couple of days to get the bio reactor up.
[03:24:25.620 --> 03:24:27.580]  So we're going to start the work tomorrow.
[03:24:27.900 --> 03:24:31.460]  And then unfortunately, we've got to break it down right away.
[03:24:31.580 --> 03:24:34.100]  And so we kind of got fucked up.
[03:24:34.100 --> 03:24:36.020]  But this is again, this is the beginning.
[03:24:36.020 --> 03:24:37.060]  More information.
[03:24:37.660 --> 03:24:40.060]  OK, fantastic.
[03:24:40.980 --> 03:24:43.460]  Joda Herbs tonight or Hoda Herbs tonight.
[03:24:44.580 --> 03:24:48.900]  We've got I don't think we have anything for Saturday's mental breakdown this week.
[03:24:48.900 --> 03:24:51.020]  There is next Saturday.
[03:24:51.020 --> 03:24:54.940]  And then, of course, the show's on Monday with John Burrfellow, Mr.
[03:24:54.940 --> 03:24:56.220]  Tote, myself.
[03:24:56.220 --> 03:24:58.740]  I don't know if Leighton's going to be able to jump back on.
[03:25:00.020 --> 03:25:01.980]  It's a special show this coming Monday.
[03:25:01.980 --> 03:25:05.780]  I'm not going to tell you why, but there's going to be a certain song sung
[03:25:05.780 --> 03:25:08.260]  for a particular individual.
[03:25:08.740 --> 03:25:10.900]  But it's going to be fun.
[03:25:11.780 --> 03:25:14.980]  London shows, Chad shows, Peter shows.
[03:25:14.980 --> 03:25:18.020]  My God, the information that's coming out on this channel
[03:25:18.380 --> 03:25:22.180]  and all three channels, it's not just a future cannabis project.
[03:25:22.380 --> 03:25:25.420]  It's FCPO2 and FCPO3.
[03:25:27.500 --> 03:25:28.740]  Daga, daga, daga.
[03:25:28.740 --> 03:25:30.180]  That's right, Chad.
[03:25:30.180 --> 03:25:32.260]  And Peter is Casanova.
[03:25:32.700 --> 03:25:33.700]  Oh, no.
[03:25:34.900 --> 03:25:36.940]  Peter, we we love Peter.
[03:25:36.940 --> 03:25:38.820]  Without him, we wouldn't be here.
[03:25:39.140 --> 03:25:42.340]  But without Leighton, Charlie, Brian,
[03:25:42.740 --> 03:25:46.020]  everybody that's bringing guests on,
[03:25:46.020 --> 03:25:48.620]  we wouldn't be able to share this volume of information.
[03:25:48.620 --> 03:25:50.420]  And it's very important.
[03:25:50.420 --> 03:25:53.940]  So like, subscribe, share, guys.
[03:25:54.700 --> 03:25:57.540]  We got to beat the algorithm to get this information out.
[03:25:57.540 --> 03:26:00.980]  So the more you comment below the videos, that also helps.
[03:26:01.660 --> 03:26:05.780]  Aggregate the information like we're aggregating our soils, our plants.
[03:26:05.980 --> 03:26:07.860]  We want more and more people.
[03:26:08.180 --> 03:26:10.900]  But I think that's about it.
[03:26:10.900 --> 03:26:16.260]  Charlie, you have I'm going to bring up your Facebook group again.
[03:26:16.540 --> 03:26:19.420]  Most people can go to their information, correct?
[03:26:19.860 --> 03:26:21.500]  Yeah, I'm old school, everybody.
[03:26:21.500 --> 03:26:24.020]  That's all I do. I don't do a lot of social media.
[03:26:24.260 --> 03:26:26.740]  I came again from the days before the Internet.
[03:26:27.180 --> 03:26:29.940]  But that's one place I try to keep current.
[03:26:30.220 --> 03:26:33.820]  I try to tell people what we're doing and I bring other wider
[03:26:34.500 --> 03:26:36.860]  stories to everyone's attention.
[03:26:37.300 --> 03:26:39.460]  So that's a great link. A great way to find me.
[03:26:39.620 --> 03:26:41.300]  I really I found the chat.
[03:26:41.300 --> 03:26:44.900]  Finally, I really appreciate everyone's comments and follow ups.
[03:26:45.420 --> 03:26:47.980]  That really encourages me definitely to come back for part two.
[03:26:48.500 --> 03:26:52.540]  Awesome. It's probably part three and probably part two.
[03:26:53.180 --> 03:26:55.060]  Oh, trust me with that.
[03:26:55.060 --> 03:26:56.660]  He could be a regular. No problem.
[03:26:56.660 --> 03:26:59.060]  But we've got to respect his time as well.
[03:26:59.060 --> 03:27:01.860]  Yeah, I'm an email away and I do like visitors on site.
[03:27:01.860 --> 03:27:03.740]  So get to Santa Fe.
[03:27:03.740 --> 03:27:06.340]  Late knows validate that we are the place to see.
[03:27:06.340 --> 03:27:08.500]  So absolutely, absolutely.
[03:27:08.540 --> 03:27:11.660]  It's it's it's the Disney world for geeks. Yeah.
[03:27:12.700 --> 03:27:16.460]  Oh, man, I'm going to have to plan a trip down to Santa Fe, New Mexico.
[03:27:16.860 --> 03:27:17.380]  And I am.
[03:27:17.380 --> 03:27:19.860]  So I mean, you know, the program, what's that?
[03:27:20.780 --> 03:27:23.260]  I was saying thanks for helping me promote the program.
[03:27:23.820 --> 03:27:25.900]  Everything I do, I say is recruiting.
[03:27:26.140 --> 03:27:28.900]  So if we can get that word out there and we can spark a couple of people
[03:27:28.900 --> 03:27:31.620]  to come here, help create solutions for the future.
[03:27:31.900 --> 03:27:33.940]  Thanks again for what you guys are doing for humanity.
[03:27:34.140 --> 03:27:36.380]  We're all in this together for the same mission.
[03:27:36.740 --> 03:27:40.180]  And with that note, I'm actually going to bring something else up.
[03:27:40.660 --> 03:27:45.700]  We had a Linda on on Monday show or on Saturday show.
[03:27:45.700 --> 03:27:48.580]  This is a veterans victories.
[03:27:48.580 --> 03:27:50.500]  It's something that they are doing.
[03:27:50.500 --> 03:27:52.140]  It's a free workshop.
[03:27:52.140 --> 03:27:55.660]  You might want to check this out, guys, and sign yourself up for it.
[03:27:56.620 --> 03:27:58.500]  Just wanted to bring that up.
[03:27:58.500 --> 03:27:59.860]  That's another promotion.
[03:27:59.860 --> 03:28:02.940]  Just like Charlie, if you have stuff like that that you're going to be doing,
[03:28:03.660 --> 03:28:05.460]  you know, send me a banner like that.
[03:28:05.460 --> 03:28:07.980]  And we can try to get them up and promote it even more.
[03:28:08.620 --> 03:28:10.460]  I do the same on my Facebook page.
[03:28:10.460 --> 03:28:13.580]  So if you all friend me over there and you're pushing something,
[03:28:13.580 --> 03:28:15.980]  you'll see I promote that stuff to.
[03:28:15.980 --> 03:28:17.260]  Fantastic.
[03:28:17.260 --> 03:28:19.340]  Cross-pollinization at its best.
[03:28:19.900 --> 03:28:21.100]  Exactly.
[03:28:21.100 --> 03:28:24.060]  And with that, guys, I think we're going to hit the end broadcast.
[03:28:24.060 --> 03:28:26.340]  So everybody have a great weekend.
[03:28:26.340 --> 03:28:27.820]  We'll see you soon.
