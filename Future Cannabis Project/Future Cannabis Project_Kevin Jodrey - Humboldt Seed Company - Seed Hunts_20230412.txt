[00:00.000 --> 00:17.300]  That tester, it's a black lime, it's a black lime skittle.
[00:17.300 --> 00:24.300]  Black lime skittle cherry pie maybe?
[00:24.300 --> 00:28.300]  Might be like a black lime cherry pie into a skittle, I can't remember.
[00:28.300 --> 00:34.300]  Well you right now are exploring, you did the red Lebanese.
[00:34.300 --> 00:36.300]  Oh nice.
[00:36.300 --> 00:38.300]  And then what are you exploring now?
[00:38.300 --> 00:42.300]  I'm going into some, from the Baalbek area, some pure Lebanese.
[00:42.300 --> 00:48.300]  So I wish I knew the kid's name but I want to say like seven years ago I was at an event in Oregon
[00:48.300 --> 00:53.300]  and a kid came up to me and was telling me about his crew had been over in Lebanon gathering stock
[00:53.300 --> 00:55.300]  and he says, Kev, I just got to give these to you.
[00:55.300 --> 00:59.300]  So he gives me the seeds and I put them in the vault and I just, you know,
[00:59.300 --> 01:04.300]  you've got a collection that's the size of a fucking refrigerator, you just kind of forget about it.
[01:04.300 --> 01:10.300]  And then I'm playing around with crickets and cicada Graham, the bob,
[01:10.300 --> 01:15.300]  and I just was enthralled with the puck work that he was doing
[01:15.300 --> 01:21.300]  and it was funny because I'm from that era, right, so that 88 era, I was sparked up then.
[01:21.300 --> 01:29.300]  And I remember those plants and I laughed because none of us were extractors at that point.
[01:29.300 --> 01:31.300]  So we would make keef, we would shake through a screen.
[01:31.300 --> 01:32.300]  The traditional style.
[01:32.300 --> 01:34.300]  Yeah, but we weren't washing, we weren't doing any washing.
[01:34.300 --> 01:35.300]  There was no bubble method.
[01:35.300 --> 01:39.300]  No, no, not in fucking 88 there wasn't, at least not in California.
[01:40.300 --> 01:42.300]  Or at least nobody I knew was doing it.
[01:42.300 --> 01:44.300]  No, it all started in the 90s.
[01:44.300 --> 01:52.300]  And so we missed out on that world of washing these old hash cuts.
[01:52.300 --> 01:58.300]  And so they take that skelly and he opens it up, he does a really interesting line breeding project.
[01:58.300 --> 02:04.300]  And line breeding, different than like inbred line, is you're working with the parental stock of the past,
[02:04.300 --> 02:05.300]  bringing it together.
[02:05.300 --> 02:07.300]  The grandparents, the great grandparents.
[02:07.300 --> 02:09.300]  Yeah, you're bringing them in and dejecting.
[02:09.300 --> 02:10.300]  Sometimes the great, great grandparents.
[02:10.300 --> 02:11.300]  Great grandparents.
[02:11.300 --> 02:15.300]  And so inbreeding, you're going to get inbreeding depression, but line breeding usually don't.
[02:15.300 --> 02:20.300]  And it allowed them to be able to really craft a pretty accurate representation
[02:20.300 --> 02:25.300]  of what that plant would have been in seed form at that time.
[02:25.300 --> 02:27.300]  Totally. Yeah, it's all in there.
[02:27.300 --> 02:28.300]  Yeah, it's all in there.
[02:28.300 --> 02:29.300]  And then he gathered up some of the...
[02:29.300 --> 02:30.300]  That seed from the 1970s is in there.
[02:30.300 --> 02:37.300]  He had the Pacific Northwest and then I provided him that Naples cut that was out of Grass Valley.
[02:37.300 --> 02:39.300]  So there was a legendary cut out of Grass Valley.
[02:39.300 --> 02:42.300]  I had sourced forever ago and held it and he used it.
[02:42.300 --> 02:44.300]  So me and Bob got this good relationship.
[02:44.300 --> 02:50.300]  And I go through all the different puck hybrids and that Red Leb cut just caught me, man.
[02:50.300 --> 02:53.300]  The flavor was right, the fucking high was sizzling.
[02:53.300 --> 02:54.300]  And I was like, whoa.
[02:54.300 --> 02:59.300]  So I bought a bunch of packs and I open pollinated the four packs
[02:59.300 --> 03:02.300]  so I could get a bigger population to look through in the F2.
[03:02.300 --> 03:05.300]  So on work, when I'm looking for like clonal work or parental work,
[03:05.300 --> 03:10.300]  I want to go to the F2 to look for the outliers and then I can start to collide those.
[03:10.300 --> 03:12.300]  So I have to it.
[03:12.300 --> 03:18.300]  But then I realized that he sold out within like an hour and a half of releasing it.
[03:18.300 --> 03:22.300]  And it was probably going to get produced again and nobody had access to it.
[03:22.300 --> 03:25.300]  And I just wanted to see more of that work brought into the system.
[03:25.300 --> 03:29.300]  And so I hit up Bob and said, hey, I'm going to go and open pollinate it.
[03:29.300 --> 03:32.300]  I'm going to give them out for charity and I'll pass them out at events.
[03:32.300 --> 03:34.300]  And I'll give you the credit, but I just want to sell them.
[03:34.300 --> 03:37.300]  So this way there's no, I'm not jamming your money.
[03:37.300 --> 03:41.300]  And I was just really into it.
[03:41.300 --> 03:44.300]  And so then I said, well, where did the Red Leb come from?
[03:44.300 --> 03:46.300]  So he had got it from Bam.
[03:46.300 --> 03:52.300]  And so then I hit up Bam and Bam had got it from his mentor, Kaidu.
[03:52.300 --> 03:58.300]  And so what it was, was it was this Lebanese line that produced the most incredible level of resin
[03:58.300 --> 04:00.300]  they'd ever seen on a plant.
[04:00.300 --> 04:05.300]  And it had this bell ringing, absolute ball busting high.
[04:05.300 --> 04:06.300]  And so I was like, beautiful.
[04:06.300 --> 04:10.300]  And so I had fucked with Lebanese work decades ago.
[04:10.300 --> 04:16.300]  And what I liked about it was it had early finishing times.
[04:16.300 --> 04:20.300]  And so all of a sudden I'm playing around with Bob's work.
[04:20.300 --> 04:26.300]  And it made me remember that I had Lebanese work from a couple different people put away.
[04:26.300 --> 04:30.300]  So I went into this Lebanese population and brought it out.
[04:30.300 --> 04:33.300]  And then I did a, it's kind of like, I was calling it open pollination.
[04:33.300 --> 04:37.300]  Some cats online had a fucking nervous breakdown because it wasn't a true open pollination.
[04:37.300 --> 04:38.300]  It was every male.
[04:38.300 --> 04:44.300]  But I'm like, look, I selected six diverse males that represented earliest finishing,
[04:44.300 --> 04:47.300]  most aggressive, and then the most pungent in different directions.
[04:47.300 --> 04:49.300]  Yeah, most importantly you're preserving that genetic spread.
[04:49.300 --> 04:51.300]  A pool, a spread.
[04:51.300 --> 04:54.300]  And then I'm going to use those males against the same criteria in the females.
[04:54.300 --> 04:56.300]  And then I'll take that and collide those.
[04:56.300 --> 04:57.300]  Then I can open it.
[04:57.300 --> 05:00.300]  And then I can go select out specific males and females to go in.
[05:00.300 --> 05:02.300]  That's where the pheno hunt comes in at that point.
[05:02.300 --> 05:04.300]  Yeah, that's where the chase on it is.
[05:04.300 --> 05:10.300]  The point of it was that it was about a couple years ago, what really kind of kicked in on this was
[05:10.300 --> 05:14.300]  I had connected into these farmers over in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[05:14.300 --> 05:17.300]  And I started getting stock from them.
[05:17.300 --> 05:20.300]  And what I was able to do was promote the stock.
[05:20.300 --> 05:29.300]  And then I passed the stock out to the public so that people would be able to start kind of getting their hands back on true varieties, foundation varieties.
[05:29.300 --> 05:35.300]  And I wanted the attention brought back to the farmers so that people could understand that herb farmers in these countries,
[05:35.300 --> 05:38.300]  herb farmers just like us, were under the same problems.
[05:38.300 --> 05:43.300]  But their problems were even a little heavier because the Taliban wiped out that whole Ghazni village.
[05:43.300 --> 05:46.300]  And now all that weed is gone.
[05:46.300 --> 05:50.300]  So whoever's holding that gene pool is now really the carriers of the allele.
[05:50.300 --> 05:53.300]  They're the ones that get to maintain it and move it forward.
[05:53.300 --> 05:55.300]  They're the steward of that cannabis genome.
[05:55.300 --> 06:05.300]  And what I was doing is I was taking those and I was looking for unique profiles and I was looking for better heat resistance and better water conservation.
[06:05.300 --> 06:07.300]  This is in the Afghani line.
[06:07.300 --> 06:08.300]  Afghani line, right.
[06:08.300 --> 06:11.300]  Something you could dry farm that would still finish early.
[06:11.300 --> 06:13.300]  Yeah, and so that was going to produce the resin.
[06:13.300 --> 06:14.300]  And go into rosins.
[06:14.300 --> 06:17.300]  And so it started getting me to go back into that direction.
[06:17.300 --> 06:19.300]  And those are the original hash makers.
[06:19.300 --> 06:20.300]  Yes.
[06:20.300 --> 06:21.300]  That's where it all came from.
[06:21.300 --> 06:22.300]  I started doing that with Bob's Gear.
[06:22.300 --> 06:32.300]  And then I'm so enthralled by that Lebanese work that it really kicks me back in to go, wait a minute, let me open up the Leb populations because the Afghani population typically finish later.
[06:32.300 --> 06:35.300]  And sometimes contain way more CBD and other minor cannabinoids.
[06:35.300 --> 06:37.300]  Yeah, well, so do Lebanese too.
[06:37.300 --> 06:39.300]  True, the Berkham Valley stuff comes in handy.
[06:39.300 --> 06:40.300]  A little more balanced, you know.
[06:41.300 --> 06:53.300]  But what I wanted was I wanted to be able to bring my flowering time down and have something that brought some qualities in the profile that were just lost.
[06:53.300 --> 07:01.300]  Because with the modern world herb, your COA dictates your destiny.
[07:01.300 --> 07:02.300]  Oh, yeah.
[07:02.300 --> 07:04.300]  If the COA doesn't match, distro won't touch it.
[07:04.300 --> 07:05.300]  Exactly.
[07:05.300 --> 07:06.300]  You have to be able to sell it at the end of your harvest.
[07:06.300 --> 07:08.300]  Yeah, I got a list in my pocket, right.
[07:08.300 --> 07:09.300]  I do it on purpose.
[07:09.300 --> 07:12.300]  Every nursery in the state sends me their clone list.
[07:12.300 --> 07:14.300]  And so I have every single nursery send me the clone list.
[07:14.300 --> 07:16.300]  And then I can show people, I go, see this?
[07:16.300 --> 07:18.300]  See how all these right here are low distribution?
[07:18.300 --> 07:23.300]  See how our lemon cherry gelato is 10 times the distribution at every single nursery?
[07:23.300 --> 07:27.300]  That tells you that there's going to be 10 times that quantity of product that's fucking needed.
[07:27.300 --> 07:29.300]  So this is where you don't want to go.
[07:29.300 --> 07:36.300]  Wherever they're pushing hype is where you don't want to go because you're going to be in a pool that's so big you're going to get lost in it.
[07:37.300 --> 07:43.300]  Yes, it was valuable when it was hot, but it's not going to be valuable to you by the time you get to it.
[07:43.300 --> 07:44.300]  Yep.
[07:44.300 --> 07:54.300]  And so it was working on bringing out qualities that let us do some work and start to develop profiles that are attractive
[07:54.300 --> 07:59.300]  so that what you can do is you can do small batch on your farm or in your personal life,
[08:00.300 --> 08:08.300]  and you use it to introduce to customers, you use it to introduce to, I'll say, influencers, people who see cannabis and then talk about it,
[08:08.300 --> 08:14.300]  so that what they can do is they can start to bring up the awareness of different flavor profiles, different impacts in the high,
[08:14.300 --> 08:17.300]  and get the customer to kind of come back.
[08:17.300 --> 08:25.300]  Because what we were talking about earlier was when Distro controls the market, which they do in California,
[08:25.300 --> 08:35.300]  it's based off of a COA and an Instagram ability where it must have a certain visual appeal and it has to have THC over eczema.
[08:35.300 --> 08:44.300]  And the problem is it limits the gene pool tremendously, and so what starts to happen is you start having too much of the same shit being used and rolled and moved,
[08:44.300 --> 08:50.300]  and if I close my fucking eyes, it's homogenous, and I can't tell the difference if I smoke 20 joints of different shit.
[08:50.300 --> 08:58.300]  And the problem is that when you steer by lab analysis, you are missing details that the human picks up.
[08:58.300 --> 09:03.300]  So the human can pick up 3,000th deviation with their finger. We're pretty calibrated.
[09:03.300 --> 09:07.300]  What's our calibration through the mouth, through the nose?
[09:07.300 --> 09:12.300]  Oh yeah, you can smell down to like one molecule per like 100,000 of it, like the scent of a skunk.
[09:12.300 --> 09:13.300]  Yes, it's...
[09:13.300 --> 09:15.300]  Because you've been bred for millennia.
[09:15.300 --> 09:18.300]  And what is it that we like? What gives us the palatability?
[09:18.300 --> 09:20.300]  Why do you like this and I like that?
[09:20.300 --> 09:21.300]  Exactly.
[09:21.300 --> 09:22.300]  That uniqueness.
[09:22.300 --> 09:33.300]  And for me, what I wanted to do was I try... like I work on so many projects, but when I'm working on my own projects, it's really about quality of the experience.
[09:33.300 --> 09:41.300]  And what I know is that if I'm not using a COA to steer, which I do on a lot of projects, it's heavy COA direction.
[09:41.300 --> 09:42.300]  Well, it has its time and its place.
[09:42.300 --> 09:47.300]  Well, it's mandatory. If you want to move product in California, it should be over 25, but that shit won't work.
[09:47.300 --> 09:48.300]  It has to check Xboxes.
[09:48.300 --> 09:54.300]  Germany, yeah, a lot of these other countries. And I work with other countries developing lines to move to other countries.
[09:54.300 --> 10:01.300]  And like in Germany, the deviation can only be like from harvest to harvest can only be like 0.1%.
[10:01.300 --> 10:02.300]  Yeah, they're tight.
[10:02.300 --> 10:03.300]  Super tight.
[10:03.300 --> 10:09.300]  Super, super stringent because it's a far more technical aspect of cultivation.
[10:09.300 --> 10:11.300]  Well, it's for applied pharmaceuticals.
[10:11.300 --> 10:31.300]  Yes, and it's just also the way they approach it. It's kind of like... we'll get into this one too, but when you're working with products from other countries and moving them to other countries, products that are grown biologically almost can't be used because you end up having...
[10:31.300 --> 10:32.300]  The seasonality.
[10:33.300 --> 10:45.300]  Yeah, and what you also have is you have an issue with CFUs, right? So, eucalyptiformin units, the microbial count that you get off the plant. If you're in Canada, it's a thousand. If you're in Africa, it's 300.
[10:45.300 --> 10:46.300]  That's why they're radiating everything.
[10:46.300 --> 10:59.300]  And radiating. If it's in Australia, it's a hundred. So, this level of irradiation is incredible. And so, when you're radiating cannabis, you're changing the metabolite profile tremendously. I don't give a fuck what manufacturer tells me.
[10:59.300 --> 11:01.300]  This is the same. No, you're definitely changing.
[11:01.300 --> 11:16.300]  So, what I do is I do these bulk evaluations of 150 different varieties, and I determine which ones made it through irradiation that still retain palatability. That lets me know now those are the varieties we should work with on international movements.
[11:16.300 --> 11:19.300]  Oh, interesting. So, actually breeding... yeah, that's right. Breeding for...
[11:19.300 --> 11:23.300]  Breeding and selecting. And I just notice certain profiles hold true.
[11:23.300 --> 11:27.300]  Like, oh, this terpenellin dominant will make it through, or this myrcene dominant will make it through.
[11:28.300 --> 11:40.300]  It's not even so much a single dominant. It's a complex matrix. So, the COA might say that...
[11:42.300 --> 11:44.300]  I'm just not making a comment like this.
[11:45.300 --> 11:58.300]  It might be... this is a dominant, but when you're looking at scent in a molecular point of view, minor constituents can radically change major constituents.
[11:58.300 --> 12:02.300]  There's hundreds and hundreds of terpenes that we don't even know the names of.
[12:02.300 --> 12:06.300]  Oh, well, there's 42,000 of them, really. So, there's 42,000 known terps.
[12:06.300 --> 12:08.300]  And only 300 and some of them that we can actually test for at the moment.
[12:08.300 --> 12:11.300]  Yeah, and the biggest test I ever saw was like a 240.
[12:11.300 --> 12:15.300]  Yeah, we did... so, we used a lab in France for analyzing terps.
[12:15.300 --> 12:20.300]  And what we were finding was that handwritten notes coming back to us, what is this?
[12:20.300 --> 12:21.300]  Yeah.
[12:21.300 --> 12:23.300]  Because they would identify over...
[12:23.300 --> 12:24.300]  But they're not...
[12:24.300 --> 12:27.300]  Right around half of the sample they could identify.
[12:27.300 --> 12:32.300]  And the other 50% of the sample was unidentified mono and sesquiterpenes and plant esters.
[12:32.300 --> 12:40.300]  Well, but you're going into thiols, you're talking with ketones, you're getting into your volatile sulfurs.
[12:40.300 --> 12:46.300]  And so, you have so many different metabolites that create what we consider scent and flavor.
[12:46.300 --> 12:50.300]  That when you just say that matters and you don't look at anything else, it doesn't.
[12:50.300 --> 12:57.300]  And it's the same thing with cannabinoids where we focus on THC because that metric was brought out.
[12:57.300 --> 13:05.300]  But what patients kind of discovered, and it's true because they're the ones buying it, is that the data on...
[13:06.300 --> 13:13.300]  When you buy cannabis... so, let's use the illustration as best as example is for Medi-Can.
[13:13.300 --> 13:18.300]  So, Medi-Can was the largest provider of medical recommendations in the state.
[13:18.300 --> 13:22.300]  So, they have the biggest database of why people came in to buy weed.
[13:22.300 --> 13:25.300]  Why did you come for a recommendation?
[13:25.300 --> 13:26.300]  Four reasons.
[13:26.300 --> 13:31.300]  So, 95% of the people who came for a recommendation came for one of four reasons.
[13:31.300 --> 13:36.300]  Appetite, sleep, mood, and pain. Four reasons.
[13:36.300 --> 13:37.300]  And so...
[13:41.300 --> 13:45.300]  That's interesting when you say appetite because with all the work happening around THC.
[13:45.300 --> 13:49.300]  THC, yeah, it's either appetite suppression or to increase appetite.
[13:49.300 --> 13:51.300]  But four major reasons.
[13:51.300 --> 13:57.300]  And so, those four reasons make it kind of clear why people buy cannabis at a dispensary.
[13:57.300 --> 13:58.300]  It's got the fire.
[13:58.300 --> 14:00.300]  And what you have is...
[14:03.300 --> 14:04.300]  I got one.
[14:04.300 --> 14:11.300]  This reality that when we say that THC, high THC doesn't get you higher, that's very well true.
[14:11.300 --> 14:14.300]  But it's not true in that it...
[14:14.300 --> 14:16.300]  There's some old school variables that are like...
[14:16.300 --> 14:18.300]  But it circulates longer.
[14:18.300 --> 14:24.300]  So, for people who are buying cannabis and they've been buying it for 15 years at a storefront.
[14:25.300 --> 14:35.300]  And they've noticed the correlation between THC content and duration of effect pertaining to their specific ailment.
[14:35.300 --> 14:39.300]  So, when we're not talking about as a weed smoker, I'm getting high.
[14:39.300 --> 14:43.300]  We're talking about I'm using the product in one of these four directions.
[14:43.300 --> 14:49.300]  What they notice is that these higher concentrations give them a longer circulation through their body.
[14:49.300 --> 14:52.300]  So, it really comes down to a question of affordability.
[14:52.300 --> 14:54.300]  So, it's sticking in your system for longer.
[14:54.300 --> 15:00.300]  And so, what you have is you have this idea that people want the best shit.
[15:00.300 --> 15:01.300]  And I'm like, of course they do.
[15:01.300 --> 15:04.300]  But they also have something called a fucking wallet and a budget.
[15:04.300 --> 15:08.300]  And the budget tells them what they can buy and the wallet lets them release that money in the world.
[15:08.300 --> 15:12.300]  And to me, there's only two customers that exist in the world.
[15:12.300 --> 15:16.300]  Why you came in the store, billion reasons.
[15:17.300 --> 15:20.300]  What you do when you're in the store is always based off of two.
[15:20.300 --> 15:21.300]  It's a light switch.
[15:21.300 --> 15:24.300]  I buy what I want regardless of price.
[15:24.300 --> 15:25.300]  I buy what I can afford.
[15:25.300 --> 15:26.300]  I buy what I resonate with.
[15:26.300 --> 15:27.300]  I buy what I can afford.
[15:27.300 --> 15:29.300]  I buy the best deal I can get.
[15:29.300 --> 15:30.300]  Yeah, what you can afford.
[15:30.300 --> 15:33.300]  Your money is part of it or your money is not part of it.
[15:33.300 --> 15:36.300]  So, that creates this light switch.
[15:36.300 --> 15:42.300]  And from having dispensaries for so long, it let me just realize that most of the people coming into dispensaries don't have unlimited income.
[15:42.300 --> 15:45.300]  The people who bought all the high-end product were other dope growers.
[15:45.300 --> 15:48.300]  We used to sell so much herb to other dope growers it wasn't funny.
[15:48.300 --> 15:50.300]  Because we're all buying.
[15:50.300 --> 15:54.300]  It's always the biggest honor when another grower comes to buy stuff for their head.
[15:54.300 --> 15:56.300]  You buy shit, we're moving so much oil and goodies.
[15:56.300 --> 15:59.300]  But it allows you to see this reality, right?
[15:59.300 --> 16:04.300]  That the idea of who the customer is is skewed and their desire is skewed.
[16:04.300 --> 16:09.300]  And so, what they want is they want a product that lasts longer.
[16:09.300 --> 16:15.300]  And those are other cannabinoids that as they start to go through and mark them, they can start to say,
[16:15.300 --> 16:20.300]  Hey, when we see the presence of this particular cannabinoid, we know that we should get a longer resonance of the product.
[16:20.300 --> 16:25.300]  But when you have to take that information and then present it to the public and get them to believe it,
[16:25.300 --> 16:35.300]  you're forcing them to take the risk of buying something that doesn't satisfy their needs and they don't have the money to play games.
[16:35.300 --> 16:42.300]  So, what you have is this population of people in America, specifically America we're going to talk about, that have shit healthcare.
[16:42.300 --> 16:47.300]  Herb is something they buy themselves and they need it to work.
[16:47.300 --> 16:50.300]  And that metric has worked for them in that regard.
[16:50.300 --> 16:56.300]  And what people are talking about with craft herb is the experience and they're like, look, I don't...
[16:56.300 --> 16:58.300]  Yeah, it's the experience, it's the story behind it.
[16:58.300 --> 17:01.300]  Yeah, and 90% of the people don't.
[17:01.300 --> 17:08.300]  So, when you go buy steak, are you asking the fucking guy to explain to you how Rosie the cow was hand rubbed?
[17:08.300 --> 17:11.300]  No, not unless you're buying a $500 piece of fucking Wagyu.
[17:11.300 --> 17:13.300]  And how many people buy fucking $500 Wagyu?
[17:13.300 --> 17:16.300]  Not many, right? It's a limited market.
[17:16.300 --> 17:22.300]  And so, what you're trying to do is create, at least in my opinion, right?
[17:22.300 --> 17:29.300]  I mean, it sounds like there's a big disconnect that's been created with the COA metric marketing consumer as far as what education is available
[17:29.300 --> 17:36.300]  and what we can gain from lab testing and just over the counter being a retailer, you know, consumer relationship kind of deal.
[17:36.300 --> 17:41.300]  Totally. What we didn't do, like someone asked me the other day, what was the failure in the medical...
[17:41.300 --> 17:44.300]  The failure in cannabis was that you had two failures.
[17:44.300 --> 17:52.300]  You had one failure where people who raise money didn't really have the ability to run a cannabis operation.
[17:52.300 --> 17:55.300]  And what they did is they screwed all the investors.
[17:55.300 --> 17:59.300]  So, now you have an aggressive investor community who has no faith in people in cannabis.
[17:59.300 --> 18:03.300]  So, that creates a problem to fund and build an industry.
[18:03.300 --> 18:08.300]  The next part of this is that nobody ever asked the customer what they wanted.
[18:08.300 --> 18:13.300]  We just... Because really most of the people who grow weed never met the customer.
[18:13.300 --> 18:16.300]  They meet the plug. They meet the guy that buys the pack.
[18:16.300 --> 18:18.300]  They meet the chick that moves the hundred pounds.
[18:18.300 --> 18:19.300]  The hype boy.
[18:19.300 --> 18:20.300]  They meet the one who comes...
[18:20.300 --> 18:23.300]  The hype man, the hype woman. The one that went to the farm.
[18:23.300 --> 18:26.300]  Yeah, Malibu Don. When I was a kid, there was a dude... When I was young and humble...
[18:26.300 --> 18:28.300]  Well, kid, but I'm fucking old now.
[18:28.300 --> 18:32.300]  But when I was in my 20s, there was a dude that used to come in the Humble and his name was Malibu Don.
[18:32.300 --> 18:34.300]  And I just love the name, right?
[18:34.300 --> 18:35.300]  But Malibu Don would show...
[18:35.300 --> 18:36.300]  From Cincinnati.
[18:36.300 --> 18:37.300]  No, he was from Malibu.
[18:37.300 --> 18:38.300]  From Malibu.
[18:38.300 --> 18:39.300]  Yeah, Malibu Don was a gangster.
[18:39.300 --> 18:46.300]  But Malibu Don would show up with a stack of newspaper and he would throw it out on the floor and spread it all out.
[18:46.300 --> 18:49.300]  And he would look at every single pound out of the bag.
[18:49.300 --> 18:51.300]  And if it passed, boom, it moved to the side.
[18:51.300 --> 18:53.300]  Malibu Don paid top price.
[18:53.300 --> 18:55.300]  He was a premium contact.
[18:55.300 --> 18:59.300]  He could take tremendous quantities of cannabis at one time.
[18:59.300 --> 19:01.300]  You were selling to Malibu Don.
[19:01.300 --> 19:05.300]  So most people who were in the dope game never sold to a customer.
[19:05.300 --> 19:07.300]  They didn't sell to the person who smoked it.
[19:07.300 --> 19:10.300]  So they had this radical disconnect on why people buy weed.
[19:10.300 --> 19:12.300]  And for them, it's about the experience.
[19:12.300 --> 19:14.300]  Well, yeah, because you have every other fucking base covered.
[19:14.300 --> 19:16.300]  You got money, you're pretty healthy, you're happy.
[19:16.300 --> 19:19.300]  So yeah, you're smoking for the quality of the experience.
[19:19.300 --> 19:22.300]  It's kind of like the difference between ethereal cannabis and sedative cannabis.
[19:22.300 --> 19:25.300]  All ethereal cannabis comes from equatorial areas.
[19:25.300 --> 19:29.300]  While sedative cannabis comes from fucking 20 to 30 latitude areas.
[19:30.300 --> 19:32.300]  You go live on the equator and tell me what your life's like.
[19:32.300 --> 19:36.300]  And then go live in the fucking deserts of Afghanistan and tell me what your life's like.
[19:36.300 --> 19:37.300]  And tell me what you want.
[19:37.300 --> 19:39.300]  You want to think deeply or you want to go to bed?
[19:39.300 --> 19:42.300]  You want to hide from the sun and go to sleep?
[19:42.300 --> 19:44.300]  And so that's kind of real.
[19:44.300 --> 19:46.300]  And there's nothing we can do about that.
[19:46.300 --> 19:49.300]  Except really start to say, wait a second.
[19:49.300 --> 19:53.300]  Why are we having so much customer issues?
[19:53.300 --> 19:57.300]  And that's where the trap is different.
[19:57.300 --> 20:00.300]  Because it isn't so much that the weed is better in the trap.
[20:00.300 --> 20:03.300]  It's not really better.
[20:03.300 --> 20:07.300]  What it is, is you're growing things that weren't ran through an investor.
[20:07.300 --> 20:11.300]  So when you put together a big operation, you have to have a plan.
[20:11.300 --> 20:13.300]  It doesn't have a marketing team behind it.
[20:13.300 --> 20:16.300]  It's not even the marketing team, it's your financial team.
[20:16.300 --> 20:18.300]  They're dictating some constraints.
[20:18.300 --> 20:22.300]  They're saying you must have this much square footage filled in a space.
[20:22.300 --> 20:23.300]  Yeah, it must produce X.
[20:23.300 --> 20:26.300]  You must have this much yield per square meter.
[20:26.300 --> 20:28.300]  It must cycle in this many days.
[20:28.300 --> 20:30.300]  And the COA must reach this.
[20:30.300 --> 20:32.300]  And ideally right now it would be purple.
[20:32.300 --> 20:33.300]  And here's our touch points.
[20:33.300 --> 20:35.300]  There's five criteria.
[20:35.300 --> 20:37.300]  Does it need to be hand trimmed or can it be tumbled?
[20:37.300 --> 20:38.300]  It depends on the pricing.
[20:38.300 --> 20:41.300]  And I would say that it's very rare anything gets hand trimmed.
[20:41.300 --> 20:43.300]  Except for some really exquisite indoor.
[20:43.300 --> 20:44.300]  Or boutique stuff.
[20:44.300 --> 20:46.300]  There's still the local farmers.
[20:46.300 --> 20:47.300]  They will not give up.
[20:47.300 --> 20:48.300]  Which is amazing.
[20:48.300 --> 20:49.300]  It is.
[20:49.300 --> 20:50.300]  And I'm about it.
[20:50.300 --> 20:51.300]  Because I think hand trimming is a way better method.
[20:51.300 --> 20:53.300]  It's just that when you're getting paid $250 a unit.
[20:53.300 --> 20:56.300]  And you're paying $100, $175 for a fucking hand trim.
[20:56.300 --> 20:58.300]  Exactly who's making money here?
[20:58.300 --> 21:01.300]  So what you have.
[21:01.300 --> 21:02.300]  Well the farmer never makes money.
[21:02.300 --> 21:03.300]  Well they used to.
[21:03.300 --> 21:11.300]  But what you got is you got this five criteria that dictate a reality to the people who fund the operations.
[21:11.300 --> 21:13.300]  And.
[21:13.300 --> 21:14.300]  Well it's the money and it's the greed.
[21:14.300 --> 21:17.300]  It's not greed though.
[21:17.300 --> 21:19.300]  Well it comes from having to hit X amount of money.
[21:19.300 --> 21:22.300]  Yeah because I invested money in you and I expected to pay back.
[21:22.300 --> 21:24.300]  You signed on paper a return of this.
[21:24.300 --> 21:26.300]  Yeah why did I give you money?
[21:26.300 --> 21:27.300]  So I don't take it as greed.
[21:27.300 --> 21:29.300]  I just take it as expectation.
[21:29.300 --> 21:31.300]  What happens is that you agree to it.
[21:31.300 --> 21:33.300]  And now you're beholden to it.
[21:33.300 --> 21:37.300]  So you capitulate to good common sense for the money.
[21:37.300 --> 21:43.300]  And that's your undoing because now you're forced to work in a range of products that are very limited.
[21:43.300 --> 21:46.300]  And what I've discovered.
[21:46.300 --> 21:47.300]  It's funny too.
[21:47.300 --> 21:49.300]  It's all about the story you can tell around it.
[21:49.300 --> 21:50.300]  But the customer doesn't want the fucking story.
[21:50.300 --> 21:52.300]  The customer wants to buy in and buy a goddamn bag of weed.
[21:52.300 --> 21:53.300]  The customer is not there.
[21:53.300 --> 21:56.300]  It's kind of like if you want to see this in a really good analogy.
[21:56.300 --> 21:59.300]  But we're seeing a resurgence here in California.
[21:59.300 --> 22:05.300]  With the craft farmer coming in the store with their own small branded like microbrewery.
[22:05.300 --> 22:07.300]  And how much are they moving?
[22:07.300 --> 22:14.300]  Well there's the matter of scale because you can be on a 10,000 square foot and if you're selling everything by the eighth jar.
[22:14.300 --> 22:18.300]  Versus if you're on you know 100 acres and just selling it by the truckload.
[22:18.300 --> 22:22.300]  But you're selling it by the eighth jar.
[22:22.300 --> 22:26.300]  But when someone tells me I moved 400 acres.
[22:26.300 --> 22:27.300]  I'm like that's fucking awesome.
[22:27.300 --> 22:28.300]  You move three pounds.
[22:28.300 --> 22:29.300]  You got another 700 to go.
[22:29.300 --> 22:30.300]  It's a problem.
[22:30.300 --> 22:33.300]  You're not moving enough even at the pricing.
[22:33.300 --> 22:35.300]  It's because the system is clogged.
[22:35.300 --> 22:38.300]  But it's all about the sustainability of it.
[22:38.300 --> 22:39.300]  But there's no sustainability.
[22:39.300 --> 22:41.300]  Every small farm I know is losing money.
[22:41.300 --> 22:43.300]  So they're not making any money.
[22:43.300 --> 22:45.300]  So there's no sustainability argument.
[22:45.300 --> 22:47.300]  There's no resurgence argument.
[22:47.300 --> 22:52.300]  It's the fact the customer wants better grass and they're tired of what they're buying.
[22:52.300 --> 22:58.300]  But the small farmer can't financially get the product to them at the price point that is required.
[22:58.300 --> 23:01.300]  Because the economy of scale isn't fitting.
[23:01.300 --> 23:05.300]  So you've got this situation where you're kind of fucked.
[23:05.300 --> 23:09.300]  And what you have is everybody's like you know the customer's not happy with what they're buying.
[23:09.300 --> 23:12.300]  Well the customer's not happy with what they're buying in every product they buy in life.
[23:12.300 --> 23:16.300]  It's rare in life that you're just ecstatic with what you buy.
[23:16.300 --> 23:19.300]  Because really you'd rather have them pay you to take it.
[23:19.300 --> 23:23.300]  But if you do buy something that you're stoked on you tell everybody about it.
[23:23.300 --> 23:26.300]  And you love it and you appreciate it because it was something that was...
[23:26.300 --> 23:31.300]  But how much of that herb moves that way when there's so many choices per store.
[23:31.300 --> 23:36.300]  So for me as a store owner, 15 years of store operations,
[23:36.300 --> 23:39.300]  I look at the customer different because of it.
[23:39.300 --> 23:44.300]  And I just realize they're here to get in, buy a bag of grass and get back to their life.
[23:44.300 --> 23:46.300]  They're not caught up with the story.
[23:46.300 --> 23:48.300]  They're not caught up with this shit.
[23:48.300 --> 23:50.300]  They're not watching Instagram.
[23:50.300 --> 23:52.300]  They don't give a fuck about YouTube.
[23:52.300 --> 23:57.300]  They wake up early, they get their kids to school, they go work a job that beats them up.
[23:57.300 --> 24:00.300]  They go home, on the way home they try to grab some weed.
[24:00.300 --> 24:06.300]  They like to get a pre-roll because they hope that they can smoke, make it easy and get rivet before they have to go do family shit.
[24:06.300 --> 24:11.300]  And lo and behold they're unhappy because we're not satisfying them with the product they want.
[24:11.300 --> 24:14.300]  Which is a pre-roll that's actually good quality.
[24:14.300 --> 24:16.300]  And when we sell them weed, we sell them...
[24:16.300 --> 24:19.300]  Right now that'd be like a fucking $30 joint.
[24:19.300 --> 24:20.300]  Which is insane.
[24:20.300 --> 24:21.300]  That's a $30 joint.
[24:21.300 --> 24:22.300]  And half of it would be taxes.
[24:22.300 --> 24:23.300]  Oh yeah, $30 joint.
[24:23.300 --> 24:27.300]  And so the issue that you got is this, it's a conundrum.
[24:27.300 --> 24:30.300]  And for me I couldn't solve the conundrum financially.
[24:30.300 --> 24:34.300]  So when I looked at it I said, okay, emotionally can I do this? Yes.
[24:34.300 --> 24:39.300]  Intelligently from an analytical point of view should I do this? No.
[24:39.300 --> 24:42.300]  So I fallowed my farm until this shit straightens out.
[24:42.300 --> 24:48.300]  Because why would I want to put in 700 hours to make $2.25 an hour?
[24:48.300 --> 24:50.300]  That's insane.
[24:50.300 --> 24:52.300]  You just can't fucking do it.
[24:52.300 --> 24:58.300]  You can't work at a wage that was minimum wage back in 82.
[24:58.300 --> 25:00.300]  So it doesn't work.
[25:00.300 --> 25:08.300]  And every farmer I know is losing money on their operations in some regard if they're a small farm and they're operating independently.
[25:08.300 --> 25:11.300]  It's a rough situation.
[25:11.300 --> 25:16.300]  And what has to happen is you almost have to scale down.
[25:16.300 --> 25:20.300]  So if you have canopy, we talked about this the other day with me and a permitter,
[25:20.300 --> 25:24.300]  about scaling canopy size down to the level you can move.
[25:24.300 --> 25:26.300]  Not outgrowing yourself.
[25:26.300 --> 25:28.300]  Not outgrow yourself.
[25:28.300 --> 25:37.300]  And then what you do now is you have an ability at that smaller size to go after the niche market that you're talking about, which I fully agree with.
[25:37.300 --> 25:45.300]  The people who want the experience, but the experience user is 5% of the 100%.
[25:45.300 --> 25:52.300]  So if 95% of the people come in for pain, mood, sleep and food,
[25:52.300 --> 26:00.300]  the ones that want to vibe with the herb, they're in that feel and they're in that undiagnosed, unspecified quantity.
[26:01.300 --> 26:13.300]  And I feel like it's a learning curve with everything, with cannabis being now accessible to everyone and accepted by everyone to be consuming fairly openly, depending on where you're at.
[26:13.300 --> 26:18.300]  So what trends do you predict for this year?
[26:18.300 --> 26:25.300]  I think education is going up, so diversification is going to come in.
[26:25.300 --> 26:30.300]  The trends that I think you're going to see is that you're noticing where there's the problems.
[26:30.300 --> 26:33.300]  The problems are where there's nothing ethereal.
[26:33.300 --> 26:37.300]  So you take a look and you notice that Blue Dream is hot.
[26:37.300 --> 26:39.300]  Sour Diesel is super hot.
[26:39.300 --> 26:42.300]  All the old school stuff is a huge resurgence.
[26:42.300 --> 26:47.300]  And a lot of it is because you had people that bought it and were happy with it and are pissed off they don't have it.
[26:47.300 --> 26:53.300]  And then you have people that have never bought it because it wasn't available, because it was pulled out of the system.
[26:53.300 --> 26:56.300]  So maybe they'd heard about it somewhere, so they're curious when they see it.
[26:56.300 --> 27:00.300]  And then you try it and you're like, oh my God, cannabis can be like this?
[27:00.300 --> 27:03.300]  And you're just like goofy, awake.
[27:03.300 --> 27:06.300]  But a good sour crop to me is 84 days, right?
[27:06.300 --> 27:09.300]  So like 84 is a sour crop, 77 is Blue Dream.
[27:09.300 --> 27:15.300]  So if you're not running Blue Dream to November 13th, 14th, you're not taking sour out to mid-November, it's not ripe.
[27:15.300 --> 27:18.300]  Those long-term sativas.
[27:18.300 --> 27:24.300]  And it's so hard to get that on the market because as a grower it's so hard to take that extra time and justify it in the ground.
[27:24.300 --> 27:30.300]  And the problem with sour is it doesn't move well in the new market because there's so much handling.
[27:30.300 --> 27:40.300]  So when we produced it, we grow it, we take it to our house, it gets trimmed, it gets moved to Malibu Don, and then off it goes.
[27:40.300 --> 27:43.300]  I haven't seen him in years, man, but I hope he's doing well.
[27:43.300 --> 27:44.300]  We should hook him up.
[27:44.300 --> 27:45.300]  Malibu Don.
[27:45.300 --> 27:51.300]  I had another dude that was, what's that rich area down in SoCal, Palm Springs?
[27:51.300 --> 27:53.300]  Palm Springs.
[27:53.300 --> 27:55.300]  Was Palm Springs down in Southern California?
[27:55.300 --> 27:57.300]  Yeah, yeah, San Bernardino, Palm Springs.
[27:57.300 --> 27:58.300]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:58.300 --> 28:02.300]  But his name was Doug, and he was Palm Springs Doug.
[28:02.300 --> 28:04.300]  He was a fucking character too.
[28:04.300 --> 28:12.300]  But now though, what you take it, and if you're going to hand trim it, you're about to lose almost 50% of your profit.
[28:12.300 --> 28:15.300]  And you have to hand trim sour because it's an open structure.
[28:15.300 --> 28:17.300]  The touch points are amazing, yeah.
[28:17.300 --> 28:25.300]  So what happens is that if you have a small farm that can grow sour and then can hand trim it, you're able to create a niche product.
[28:25.300 --> 28:29.300]  And then you figure out how much of this product can actually move.
[28:29.300 --> 28:34.300]  And the other strategy that has to be employed is things that you can hold back in quality.
[28:35.300 --> 28:45.300]  Because the California stores are working on these 90-day cycles where if it's got 90 days over packaging, they want to return it to you because it means it didn't sell.
[28:45.300 --> 28:52.300]  So what you have to do is you have to take your harvest, you've got to get it bucked, you've got to hold it in storage.
[28:52.300 --> 28:53.300]  Store it well.
[28:53.300 --> 28:55.300]  Well, refrigerate it.
[28:55.300 --> 29:02.300]  And then you have to only trim and package the amount you believe you can move in a 90-day period.
[29:02.300 --> 29:03.300]  100%.
[29:03.300 --> 29:05.300]  And where's that data coming from?
[29:05.300 --> 29:07.300]  This is just fucking crap.
[29:07.300 --> 29:08.300]  You're rolling dice.
[29:10.300 --> 29:12.300]  What about the other part of it too?
[29:12.300 --> 29:24.300]  Where a 5,000 square foot farm has a hard time staying on a store shelf and maintaining shelf presence because you only have X amount of square footage so it's easy to sell out and then you just disappear for X amount of days until you have more.
[29:24.300 --> 29:28.300]  And what you do in that case, the strategy with that, and that's what I'm seeing too.
[29:29.300 --> 29:33.300]  I work with the program, an educational program.
[29:33.300 --> 29:37.300]  And so we get all the buyers from all the country, all the world coming into us.
[29:37.300 --> 29:43.300]  And so right now through that program, there's probably $2.5 billion worth of herbs sold around the world of people I trained.
[29:43.300 --> 29:47.300]  So it lets me say $2.5 billion of weed is sold by people I fuck with.
[29:47.300 --> 29:49.300]  That gives me a pretty good idea.
[29:49.300 --> 29:50.300]  Influence them.
[29:50.300 --> 29:51.300]  Yeah, I can influence it.
[29:51.300 --> 29:53.300]  To scare people to good decisions.
[29:53.300 --> 29:55.300]  And different decisions.
[29:55.300 --> 29:56.300]  Or just educated decisions.
[29:56.300 --> 30:08.300]  Yeah, but it's about the reality that when these people come in that are running the largest MSOs in the world and we take them to a craft farm or we break out Better Pot, they go, whoa, that's really good.
[30:08.300 --> 30:10.300]  That's better than our shit.
[30:10.300 --> 30:11.300]  And I help them understand.
[30:11.300 --> 30:14.300]  Oh, that's Larry Chimes from Josh.
[30:14.300 --> 30:16.300]  Nice.
[30:16.300 --> 30:18.300]  That came out of, I sent that.
[30:18.300 --> 30:19.300]  That's original stock.
[30:19.300 --> 30:20.300]  I'm involved in that one.
[30:20.300 --> 30:23.300]  That was, yeah, that was the one.
[30:23.300 --> 30:24.300]  After we smoked that one.
[30:24.300 --> 30:25.300]  Yeah.
[30:26.300 --> 30:28.300]  This dog league, dude.
[30:28.300 --> 30:32.300]  And how can you help consumer education to help this too?
[30:32.300 --> 30:34.300]  It's like it all works together here.
[30:34.300 --> 30:42.300]  The consumer can only be educated at the point of sale because nobody wants to just spend their, only dope freaks watch three hours of dope freak shit.
