the- what is up living so
nerds as you guys can see
you've been working on stuff
behind the scenes trying to
figure out really help Peter
makes things look so seamless-
and- believe me it's quite a
lot of stuff. You know a lot
of our audience Marco you
know we're talking about
right before we came on- when
we see a lot of people in
public at the expo's I just
came back from an expo's maybe
that's why I'm I'm that's kind
of on the forefront of my mind.
As a lot of people think that
there's so much glamour in-
being a cannabis farmer and
then there's even more glamour
being like a commercial
cannabis farmer and- you know
people kind of like wanting to
buy your seeds and all that
stuff and- I believe that that
is a huge part of the-
commercial cannabis industry-
but not for everybody and-
trying to get to the level
that- Kimmy our guest today
Jack Loeb farms is that. You
know in my opinion it's kind
of like NFL like the small
percentage of the small
percentage are going to be
able to find success yes
people can build brands
there's no doubt about that
and start off ways but how
do they continue how do you
get people to want to come
back to your brand- and that
is the huge caveat obviously
because you're going up
against the big dollar
individuals- so we're going
to kind of break all that
down today pick her brain-
and to be honest Jack Loeb
I've never you know when we
when we interviewed you for
the kind of like the cowboy
club stuff. When we got off
of that yeah when we got
off of that- I've never had
so many people reach out
and say that you're just
like you're such a great
human being people you know
going out of their way.
You know when the show's
over most people move on
with their life you know
until the next one but how
many people must have you
know. When that show was
over must have reached out
and just been like hey you
know that chick is on point
I think she got a raw deal-
so I just wanted to put
that out as well that I
think. The community in
your sphere in your world
respects you more than I've
seen from really anybody
else so shout out to you
on that you get a little
salute as well- Marco.
Let's get. Yeah and then
let's see you know kind of
break this down I know
Marco has a lot of
questions- just to really
really bring out. You
know. You might. Awesome
oh yeah well you know I
good to see you again
Kimmy- yeah definitely
good always great having
a grower on the show- the
people are already talking
are we going to have
living soil is going to
be some you know growing
conversation I was like
yes I'll be a little bit
of you know I mean I
want to talk about a
little bit of everything
you know soil will talk
about kind of. Cost of
doing what you do on a
commercial scale hidden
cost things that you
might not think of when
you're- planning to do
that on a business and
then. And everything in
between so yeah once
again thanks for you
know coming and you
know. Sitting there with
us on the show I like
the new graphics fellows
look really good. Got me
actually a little height
when it came on you know
I mean so- yeah so great
work on that so- yeah
while we just get into
it I see you know since
the cowboy cut when I
will talk about that but
you're still here right
still grind and still
doing your thing. That's
the point you know when
you have a good quality
brand you know it's
going to stick around
that be little dips and
valleys things get in
your way obstacles move
past them we're just
talking about this
constantly like narrowing
your circle you know
what I mean and stuff
like that so yeah we'll
get into it all- Kimmy
want to tell folks a
little bit about yourself
and kind of your
operation you know and
what does kind of start
this whole thing off.
All right- audio is
good. All right yeah I'm
Kimmy with Jackalope
Farms I've been in
commercial weed since
the day I started in
the cannabis industry I
started over in
California when I was
like seventeen trimming
and humble and it's
just kind of always
been in my life and
escalated and I grew
in California I grew
out in Maine and then
Oklahoma became an
opportunity so I ended
up out here so Jackalope
Farms is a like complete
like nerd out passion
project of like all the
things I've ever wanted
to do with the cannabis
farm and it's just me
and my partner and we
have like one other
friend who backs us up
a little bit who just
moved down to the area
and she like me and
her grew weed together
for a long time so it's
kind of just like a big
farm that I get a nerd
out on finally and
yeah it's a cool project
and I'm in Oklahoma
which is a whole new
opportunity to learn how
to grow here and we've
been here for three
seasons now and it's
going good but there's
been a constant constant
problem but I think
that's just like what
farming is definitely
it's fixing shit yeah
right it's like you
gotta know how to fix
it you gotta know how
to build shit and that's
all part of it so yes
obviously so three years
you guys went out there
you know when Oklahoma
went legal or whatever
so what have been give
me a few reasons kind
of why you know not
staying Cali versus
you know new opportunity
in Oklahoma and has
that been you know good
for y'all do y'all like
where Oklahoma's going
and where you're at
right now yeah so
leaving California was
like just kind of
circumstance I was
renting property there
and like one of my
rental properties
eventually ended up
getting like a federal
raid and an abatement
so that whole operation
just had to like we
cut down every single
plant in three hours
or I mean three days
moved him off the
property after he figured
out we were on the
raid list and that was
basically the end of
that farm because then
we were just it was on
the abatement list and
the person who owned
the property didn't
want to like keep going
and then I find out
next year whoever
bought that property
totally got raided the
next year so can I
talk a little bit about
that because that's
that's crazy to me man
I mean I've seen it all
yeah so what is it
like are you living
out there you have
your plot of land you
grow on your plants
and you're doing it
in a way that you feel
is you know legal of
course or whatever
and then all of a
sudden you get on a
list or somebody tips
off the local sheriff
that y'all are out
there how does that
work for that situation
that was so everyone
was like it was 215
days so we had lawyers
and we had a script
for every single plant
but they were using
the game warden which
are federal agents to
go through and just
go up a creek and
that's like how they
got into your property
is through these
federal agents with
the water board the
water board was a big
one too so instead
of the state agencies
being like how they
got in it was probably
something you can walk
up the creek and they
would just literally at
that point it was like
they could just fly
over they made a map
put an X and they
would they would just
go with their convoys
down a road and just
hit hit hit hit hit
I don't think people
realize the power that
those individuals hold
right I mean they
have beyond resting
however they want well
just the warden
themselves like when
they're out there yeah
and so do you think
that you anybody was
tipped off or you
think like they just
kind of understand
Humboldt is you know
obviously known for
what it is and you
just kind of walk where
you walk and you get
to pick off people
luck of the draw I
think it was you
know we have a
beautiful farm you
know all organic you
know we were doing
all the right things
we had a hundred
thousand gallons of
water storage we
weren't taking from
the creeks but that
doesn't matter to
water agency well
they were just trying
to you know there's
it's like a game of
cat and mouse right
they have every day
they wake up and
they got a job to
do and it's the fuck
you and yeah so
yeah so moving on
I ended up leaving
I bought a place in
Maine actually I
moved to Maine
before Oklahoma and
Maine's chill how
was it growing out
of Maine how's their
weather is it on
growing seasons
probably pretty short
I'm managing up in
Maine yeah it's
short and there's
like a new new
problems but also
it was we just had
to do a lot of
shorter season plants
and the medical program
was pretty cool up
there and everyone's
so chill everyone
really minds their
business in Maine
like you don't have
to worry about your
neighbors because
they don't want to
know and then just
after circumstances
of you know life
and personal life
a opportunity in
Oklahoma it like
came out like I
called my friend
I was like what are
you doing like with
your life and he's
like I got a farm
in Oklahoma you
should try this out
like yeah that
sounds good but
I've also like always
been a traveler like
I just travel around
the world as much
as I can so
you know very free
with like I can go
anywhere it's okay
so when they say do
go feel free to travel
young person that
was you you're like
yeah I'm gone I'm
gonna travel.
Oh, yeah.
I was out real early.
So you said you were
like 17 years old
trimming weed, you
know, yeah to be
honest at least on
the East Coast.
That's sounds like
the American dream,
right?
But probably where
you're from that's
kind of everybody
knows you're the
kind of the bus boy
of the bartending
world. So were you
able to have that
in your family or
is that something
where you knew hey,
I just got a trim
for a while and
hopefully I'll learn
and move my
move my knowledge
up to where I can
start farming for
myself.
Yeah, I became a
farmer accidentally
kind of but when
I was traveling
I'm from Reno,
Nevada, which is
like on the California
border.
So I would like
I was really traveling
and playing music.
That was my whole
deal.
Was just traveling
around the country
playing music having
a good time and I
would go trim weed
for a couple months
to make, you know,
like five grand and
you know, keep up
that lifestyle.
So
I just fell into it
through like contacts
like when you're
playing music you
meet so many people
and you're like
what's the perfect
gig work is?
Oh, yeah trimming
weed because you
you know the job
ends you make a
good amount of
money back then
you did.
And then you can
just dip out and
keep going
and through trimming
you meet a ton of
growers and a ton
of people.
And so if you're a
good trimmer, they
love your work ethic.
You'll get better
job offers.
And then I act
I kind of just got
a big grow job
offer just by
chance of meeting
people and
you know,
showing that I'm
a good worker.
Nice.
Damn, that's great.
See, that's why
you can take that
skill of trimming
and obviously turn
it into something
much bigger.
Key points.
You got to be good
at what you're doing
and when you're good
enough the people
hiring you are going
to want you back.
Where's Kimmy?
Kimmy gets my shit
tight.
I want her, you
know, so that's just
kind of that
work ethic.
That's what's wonderful.
Yeah, I'll work
18 hours a day
and do the bullshit
and my shit's
going to look good
before it gets turned
in and then oh,
you need help
harvesting.
Yeah, of course.
I'll help harvest.
Oh, of course.
I'll do that.
I'll do the shitty
job and
I mean, that's kind
of what farming is.
It's just all kind of
repetitive shitty jobs,
but it's great.
I love it.
Like I'm not but to
get to show farmers
are like people
that with more money
that they want you.
You gotta you gotta
grind and that's what
I'm always looking
for now to like on
in a worker like
people that get it.
I'm like, yep.
That is who I'm hiring.
That is my first call.
That's who I'm going to
get.
Damn hard work is
always a bar.
So yeah,
what's got to come from
the top down,
you know, I see a lot
of people saying hey
hard work is important,
but they themselves
don't carry that
and I think in the
cannabis space
people hear that
that's lip service
and then the team starts
to slack off
because the you know,
the top branches
are slacking off.
So it's nice to see
that you're not only
you know in the trenches,
but it seems like you're
carrying on like hey,
this is our baby
and you better treat
it like your baby.
That's why you're here
because it's a small time
team trying to do
bigger things and
it's usually the other
way around where you
know, you first get in
with some of these,
you know, there's these
green blah blah blah's
here in Denver where
of course you can get
on a trimming job,
but it's it's nasty stuff.
I would hope that people
that were able to work
with you and realize
like here is an outlier
opportunity.
I'm going to be able
to learn from someone
that's in the trenches
doing this stuff
and then what you know,
you're paying me to do it.
So sometimes I think
some people need to
flip their mindset on
this kind of stuff where
it's like I only make
this much doing these
things. Well, your
skill set is only at
that level right now,
right? So if you can
trim and water, then
you get paid to trim
and water. If you can
start to manage a
facility, then you
start to get paid to
manage the facility
and once people start
to maybe humble
themselves a little bit,
I think that they'll
see that going the
way that Kimmy has
gone is in my opinion
the only way to go
because the suits are
going to eat you alive
and either always trying
to take more equity
from you because
they're constantly
running out of money
or just kind of guiding
you in ways where
you know, that's not
the right way. It's
more of like, you
know, veering off
kind of what the
heart of our community
is partnering up with
brands that are going
against the homegrower.
I mean just a lot of
things that are kind
of eye-opening. So
I think that's why the
community in Oklahoma
like you're kind of a
beacon to a lot of
these people Kimmy
you're doing something
right. So let's get
into more of like what
made you decide to come
to Oklahoma and then
really get into like
the nitty-gritty of
what it takes, the
licensing, how long
those processes take
and all that kind of
stuff. Okay. So
the nitty-gritty of
getting to Oklahoma.
It wasn't that gritty.
I got to Oklahoma.
I was in a point
in my life where I'm
like, oh, I just kind
of blew my entire life
up actually. Ended
up selling a house
moving out of Maine
and I was like going
back to California.
I'm like, I'll just go
get like a manager
job at some grow in
Humboldt or something.
I called my buddy
who is like one of
my best friends and
he grew in Humboldt
like not with me,
but you know, we're
buddies out there. So
I called him up. I'm
like, yo, what's up
like what's going on?
And he said he got
a farm out here and
I could and like they
were they literally
like just got like
signed the leaf the
papers for their
property. So like
yeah, you should come
out and do a year
and try it out.
So I'm like, all
right, that sounds
good. So I packed
up my shit and
moved out to Oklahoma
and I did like a
crop share a year
at his farm and
then made enough
money, you know,
grew enough. I only
did two 10 by
hundred foot beds
and made enough money,
but the pound prices
was like suspiciously
high. I'm like,
there's no way this
is going to like last
but I made enough
money to put a
down payment on
this property that
I bought that
Jekyll farms is on
which is like it
was totally raw
land. That was
never my intention.
I would not suggest
getting raw land
to start.
Just like hard
red clay. Just
yeah, I bought a
gravel pit, but
okay, but it's
like beautiful. It's
in this beautiful
River Valley and
like every time I
drove past. I'm
like, ah, if I could
afford property here,
this is where I'd
want it and I
randomly sent in
a Facebook message.
Like I tried emailing
a bunch of people
and like, hey, can
I grow and buy
this property and
grow weed on it?
And a Facebook
message is eventually
what got me this
property. I just
sent this person
who owned a shit
ton of property in
the area. I'm like,
hey, do you have
any property for
sale that I could
grow weed on? And
he's like, yes, I
do. Like, come on
out. And it wasn't
even on the market.
So I just ended up
with this property
and put the down
payment on and now
we're just growing
weed now here.
But it was a ton
and a ton of hard
work. It was
insane. Very.
You know, that's
pretty wild though.
If you think about
it, you were very
direct, you know,
what you know, I
want to grow
cannabis here. Does
anybody have any
land? And they
said, yeah, that's
going to eliminate
all the extra
bullshit from
neighbors that
didn't want you or
people that didn't
want you there.
Right. So that's
kind of, oh, yeah,
I'm not trying to
like, I'm not
trying to beat
around the bush.
Like I'm going to
I'm going to grow
weed here and it's
going to be a legal
operation. But
if you're going to
have a problem with
this down the road,
then I don't even
want to look at the
property type of
thing. So let's
let's get our viewers
into. So now, OK,
you got that part
done. Now we got
to get a license
and we have to be
legal with the state.
So can you kind of
break that down on
really what it takes
to even get one of
those? And you are
in a state where
it's easy. I just
want to put that
out there.
Oklahoma was
really easy. So
if people are looking
around all the other
states. I would
definitely suggest
finding a lawyer,
Googling that lawyer
and making sure
they're not sketchy
lawyers because
those are a
dime a dozen in
the cannabis industry
as well. Like or
talk to multiple
lawyers and see
your best bets on
the best way to
get like licensing
like with us. Maybe
we had some bad
legal advice, but
we got it all
figured out and
it was pretty easy
for us to get a
license. You know,
OMA, which is
the Oklahoma
Medical Marijuana
Authority, is
basically an online
form and you get
some forms and we
are in a county
like we are in the
middle of nowhere.
So we had no
codes. We did
that on purpose
to like we didn't
want to be in city
limits because we
know there's going
to be way more
building codes and
like fire marshal
stuff and like HOA's
like all these
things you have to
think about on
location. Like I'm
going to get a weed
property. People
are probably going
to get mad at me,
especially if you're
doing greenhouse
outdoor. So
location is a good
thing to think about
and licensing and
zoning. We definitely
did a bunch of
research beforehand
and then we just
did all the paperwork
and paid the thing
which was like,
it was all pretty
simple, but it
went kind of slow
and people get
frustrated, but of
course it's bureaucracy.
So as far as
like I think
states go, Oklahoma
is pretty chill,
but it was definitely
like a total shit
show for years and
it's still kind of
a shit show.
But you got very
lucky being out in
the sticks then
because in the city,
the fire marshals
had like a hair up
their ass and
especially in like
Broken Arrow and
around those areas
where Tulsa where
they would all of
a sudden be like,
okay, you know,
you're almost
completed with your
build out and then
they're like, okay,
you need fire
sprinklers set up
and you need this
giant pump thing.
We're talking
I mean, $50,000 to
start putting that
shit in. So this was
it seemed like
huge.
Yeah, it's
it. Everybody's
got to get their
little piece, you
know, so however
it would be, it
seemed like all
these other
government entities
started to realize
it's like, wow,
these cannabis
folk, they'll
basically like put
up with anything
as long as they
can get their shit
on board. And
some of those
people seem like
they took advantage
of the ones that
maybe didn't have
the right guidance
from a lawyer.
And that is huge
in any sense,
especially when
you're trying to
build your own
company and in
a way go against
the grain with
the federal government,
even though it's
legal. And that's
the part that's
scary for a lot
lot of people as
well. You're legal,
but I'll go to
prison right now.
Right. But the
big dogs say
no still. So
that's a weird
thing to be.
Except I pay
federal taxes on
this, which is
like, yeah,
of course.
Yeah, that's
wild. And that's
the way you did
that. It was
double smart to
like I would do
the same thing.
Go out in the
cut where nobody's
gonna mess with
you and people
don't realize if
you go, you
think you're
going to do
something on a
piece of property.
The building
codes can get
you, you know,
like thinking
I'm going to do
just a hoop house
and live in a
shack next to
it for a year
until I get my
shit together.
You know,
depending on where
you're at, you
may not be able
to do that. You
may get there
and they may say
you need to
you know, kind
of have
yeah, you
have building
permit for
every greenhouse
and everything.
So that can hurt
you right hurt
your bottom line
before you even
get started. So
yeah, good
call doing that
research. That's
always key.
Yeah.
And so you're
lucky you got
your regs. It's
I mean, your
license is pretty
easy. Now when I
was in Nevada,
the regs are
like two old
phone books.
I mean literally
like four inches
thick and it
was ridiculously
expensive out
there. You know
what I mean? So
you got your
license. You're
in Oklahoma.
Now what you
got? Um, you're
ready to set up
your growth. You're
growing. So what
do you what are
your plans? Like
you have that
barren soil. So
how do you kind
of get that all
that going off
the ground, you
know, for me.
So yeah.
So once we got
the property, we
kind of thought
our soil was
going to be a little
better. We
definitely run
like we found
the property. We
love for like
pocket. Let's just
buy it. We'll
deal with everything
else and getting
deeper into the
soil. We also
bought it in like
December. So it was
freezing. It was
really cold. Getting
into the soil is
like, all right,
this is like all
gravel and clay
and we're not
going to be able
to like amend
it fast enough.
We can't take
all these rocks
out and get cover
crops on fast
enough to make
a profitable
business. So
we have to think
of something fast
and sustainable
and not insanely
expensive to get
plants in the
ground because
of course the
second you can
get plants in
the ground,
you're there to
grow weed and
that's the only
thing that's going
to make you money.
So we're like,
all right,
plants in the
ground doesn't
matter if setups
not perfect.
So we decided
to do these
hugelkultur
pits was the
big solution
because of
course we could
have just done
raised beds,
but there's also
an incredible
like soil shortage
in Oklahoma at
this time and
there wasn't like
companies building
like bulk soil.
So like you
couldn't get 50
yards of
a mix
brought to your
farm for like
for like a
reasonable price
like that's
organic because
also every like
a lot of soil
companies here
use mushroom
compost, but in
the mushroom
compost, there's
chicken litter
from all the
chicken farms out
of here. So
that's like a
majority of
the content. So a
lot of our soil,
we couldn't even
soil options were
like even just off
the table.
And then the other
option is what
spend a hundred
thousand dollars on
trucking in
peat moss
soilless media
from California,
which a lot of
people were doing
and that was not
an option for us
at all. So
the hugelkultur
was really like,
all right,
this is what
we're doing.
So did you have
you had on
trees on the
property? You
guys had some
stuff to clear
and is that where
you got your
ingredients for
your hugels?
Yes. So the
the property is
like all like
oak forest
and a lot of
it's like
the oak trees
aren't in the
best health. There
are definitely
some healthy
ones, but
a lot had
middle rot.
So in our
clearing just
for where our
greenhouses are
going to be
we got this
dozer guy
who's like an
85 year old
local dude
and he came
out and dozed
everything
and so we had
these huge
messy, messy
piles of
trees
surrounding
our entire
grow area
and then he
dug
like these
hundred foot
by 30 foot
size
pits that were
like three feet
deep in the
ground.
They're like
kind of like a
little swimming
pool.
Well, a huge
swimming pool,
but pretty
shallow.
And
so then we
started chainsawing
all those
piles of logs.
So basically
everything that
was from that
area is now
in the Hoogle
pit
and that took
us a
shit ton of
time.
A lot of work
right there. Yeah,
I can feel you all
know.
Well, it was
free stuff. You
got all that free
material so you
couldn't pass it
up. Yeah,
it was really
good material
like oak
and like
half of its
rotting,
half of it
is not rotting
so it'll be a
long-term
Hoogle
down.
And
so we just
yeah, we back
filled with about
a foot and a
half of just
solid logs.
There's like
videos on my
Instagram
with like the
Hoogle pits
that are like
insane.
And then we
just put some
hay on top
of it and some
compost.
So we found
organic hay,
which is also
really hard to
find in Oklahoma.
Like that
doesn't that
wasn't sprayed
with glyphosates,
which these
are all things
you have to like
really think
about if
you're doing
like a
regen type
thing or
an organic
farm
sourcing
material
and then
so
we found
the hay
and we found
a good
rabbit compost
luckily
and then we
just got top
soil delivered
from like
certain sources
and then we
basically just
built
a soil from
that and it
has
it's like
been my favorite
soil. I've like
ever worked
with
so
yeah,
I highly suggest
doing this
but it's just a
shit ton of
work. So
be prepared.
Did you ever
you know, when
you're working
on those things,
you know, and
you're using
that equipment.
Don't you just
say damn
this will be a
mother without
this equipment
like you
couldn't even
do some of
these projects,
you know what I
mean without
having yeah,
yeah without the
dozer would have
been possible. And
then also
we tried to
do like to
fill the
hooghles without
a skid steer
for like a
good month. So
like me
and Andy
were like
tying trees
to my truck
and like
pulling
these trees
into the pit
and then chainsawing
them up there
and after a month
of that we're like,
I think we need
to rent a skid steer
and just like get
this shit in the
hole.
Get it done.
Yeah.
Yeah. And even
with a skid steer
we had a skid steer
for a solid month
and we were running
chainsaws 12
hours a day.
We were really
buff.
Yeah. Yeah.
That's a that's a
good work right
there.
Yeah. So obviously
those plants are
probably by now
if they're you know,
a few years old.
I mean plants are
obviously crushing
in those beds.
Yeah, they're doing
great. Yeah,
because I'll dig down
and I like can get
to the pit
and you just see
all this like fungal
matter and it's like
breaking down the
logs like surprisingly
fast and
it's so cool.
You just see like
huge logs of mycelium
and
really fun to nerd out
on.
Yeah, exactly.
So
what
so like when you're
getting your certificate
you're building your
stuff out
like,
you know your
background obviously
you've been doing this
since your teens.
I mean, that's pretty
fucking cool.
How did you know like
all right, I'm going
to run this way like
what setup did you
want to build so that
people can start to
think can you roughly
say like what are
these costs?
I mean, we don't need
to know like super
details, but roughly
this to build these
things would be
you know,
I think when people
hear those numbers
there they'd be
or some people might
be shocked at what
it takes to build a
quality greenhouse.
Yeah.
Well, okay.
The greenhouses we
had a very very
strict budget.
Very strict.
So everything
every single like
piece of equipment
everything resourced
was like
heavily researched on
how to get the
cheapest possible.
So and how to do
it yourself.
So with the greenhouses
we actually
I imported them
myself from China
via Alibaba.
So I found a
greenhouse maker
out there which a
lot of the greenhouses
come from there
anyway, so I'm just
like I'll just
eliminate the middleman
because there were
greenhouse companies
out here, but they
were selling shit
for like
five times as much
as I could have
gotten it.
So I'm gonna make
that middleman.
Yeah, so I learned
how to do
importing
which isn't that hard.
It's pretty easy.
There's a lot of
forums
and so our greenhouses
ended up costing
plus we got a bunch
of extra metal
and
bunch of extra like
plastic like blackout
plastic all in one
package.
The two greenhouses
and a bunch of extra
stuff to be able to
do auto depths
minus the motors
cost
I think $7,000
imported.
That's with shipping.
That's cheap.
You do super cheap.
It was like
but it it was like
our like days
and days of like
chatting with people
and finding the right
greenhouse company
on Alibaba
and like trusting that
you're sending a money
wire to China that
you really hope
it's not just going to
disappear.
What do you save yourself
probably half right?
Easy. My friends got
greenhouses
and each one
of theirs costs
like 20 grand
20. So you
yeah, so you get
I save like
I mean, they don't have
like it's not
top of the line,
but I think they're
better than some of them
some of the kids I've
seen out here.
You got a
lot of
like
I'd love to have a
fancy greenhouse,
but not there yet.
Well, and that's kind of
the point of this show
today is that
you got there's
give and takes with
this so you can have
all the bells and
whistles, but you're
going to have to give
up probably the majority
of your company
just to get the
you know,
the wheels turning
to have a
you know, 150
$250,000
greenhouse with all the
well that that's not
even all the bells and
whistles yet, but that
starting with all the
bells and whistles
obviously the
hoodies don't have that
kind of money.
So the show today.
I hope that you guys
kind of see for yourself
that it's better to
maybe hold out
maybe maybe wait a year
or two on this dream
and continue to find
ways to do it yourself
than to
you know, basically
sell all your equity
before you've even made
money
to individuals that
you know in the
in hindsight, they don't
really give a fuck
about anything that
you're talking about.
You think that they
care about the medicine
and stuff and
if they're more of a
VC, they don't if
it's somebody that you
you know known for a
long time and you're
trying to pitch.
I think that's a
different thing,
but I saw a lot of
individuals in Oklahoma.
They were ready to
take money from anybody
and without really
thinking about how
how are you going to
pay that back or how
are you not going to
give up enough equity
to now they're going
to tell you
where to sit down,
you know,
that's got to be a
weird feeling to start
your own company and
brand and then
have a
another person with a
little bit more money
than you come in and
start telling you what
to do.
I wouldn't know
which I am not
really not take
away from
Yeah, we saw that.
I haven't saw that
with this company
called Mass Roots
here in
Colorado, you know,
where people just
I don't know
the guy was maybe
too young to run the
business.
So moving forward.
I want that to be a
cautionary tale to
people like just
because you might not
man this can take me
another year or two
that might actually
be a springboard
compared to you trying
to go partner up
with individuals.
Now, you're three years
in and you realize
that man nobody's
seems like everybody's
making money.
Yeah, if you're
partnering up with
people, you don't
know
like holy cow,
like you got to get
everything in writing
because I've seen
best friend
friendships like
crumble because of
weed farms and that's
why I don't have like
I'm like people
want to partner with
me. I'm like no,
dude, like
it's going to get
messy because I like
to do how things how
I like to do it.
And I know you're
going to want the
same way
and especially taking
investors. I could not
imagine having like
someone that doesn't
that's not in with
the plants every day
trying to be like
well, why isn't it
like this?
Like we'll get your
ass in there, but
yeah, but they will
like you said, right?
If they give you if
you give they give
you that money now
they got they got
a voice. So
that's why I like
you said man's
self-fund like you
did. Can we know
self-fund as much
as possible? Stay
small grow into it,
you know, grow into
that greenhouse that
that all fully
automated that you
want, you know,
eventually whatever
it may be.
I'm always a fan of
that star small like
they did just get
plants in the ground.
You know what I mean?
That's key. Do y'all
do any kind of
basically just compost
or like you doing
any kind of inputs
like an
natural but what do
y'all do kind of
defeat thing?
Um, so
for our like so
the hoogle pits are
like I do soil
testing every run
and then we're making
compost over here.
So we
so everything like
Oklahoma has incredible
like really strict
testing.
So everything has to
be incredibly clean.
So clean
so nothing nasty
goes into this soil
like it is tested
all the time any
so I make my own
compost because that's
like kind of the only
compost I can trust
at this point
not saying that
there's not good
compost out there.
It's just not close
to me.
So just make my own
so I use a lot of
rabbit
compost with wood
chips and then that's
just kind of doing
this thing and I use
beneficial microbes
and you know,
I'm messing with
some jadam stuff and
you know, that's fun
when I have time to
do that. I love
I love all the microbes
stuff
but for the scale
really making the compost
is what feeds most of
soil and then we use
worm castings from
some cool worm cast
guys that I know
and
then
you know, we have
I'll use some like
organics alive for like
vegging plants
and
you know, we try to keep
everything
as small as
like as close as possible.
You know, we're growing a
bunch of comfrey now
and we're growing a bunch
of
alfalfa
just to be able to have
clean alfalfa that's not
sprayed with glyphosate
and that I know what
soil it was grown in
it like it kind of makes
me sound like I'm a crazy
like
conspiracy
conspiracy theorist that
there's shit and everything
but
that's not a conspiracy.
I just want like my I
need my shit to pass
these tests like there's
heavy metals and fucking
everything and
I'm
my shits not testing heavy
metals. So
you know, I'm doing something
right.
You
so like for like veg.
So I guess with you being
an outdoor setup, what is
it? What's your badge looking
like? When do you start
prepping for I guess this
season? We're about to start
hitting. Obviously, that's
already been done.
So what does that look?
What's that looking like?
So I have moms going right
now in a greenhouse.
So
I've like plasticated off
like the first
like quarter of the
greenhouse. I just have moms
in there under some lights,
but they get sunlight most
of the time and then I
have a couple like string
lights. I keep to keep them
in veg
up and just are they just
in pot?
Yeah, so I found pots, but
I do have some in the
ground. But the reason
they're in fabric props is
because Oklahoma weather
is so insane. Like I'm
just like I need to make
sure I can like take half
my moms inside and in case
there's like an insane
storm in February
that maybe my greenhouse
like couldn't keep up
with and then the other
half are just in the
ground.
Yeah, because these are
your mom.
Either situation.
Yeah. Yeah, that's that's
that's that's smart.
Has that bet, you know,
you can't put all 100%
in the greenhouse and the
greenhouse blows down.
You don't have a season
coming up. So what do you
do? I'm kind of just start
I guess you start cloning
here soon if that's what
you're doing. And then
also if someone were
going to do seeds,
I imagine now is the
time to go ahead and
get everything going.
Yeah, I'm doing clones.
I kind of grow like all
a year. We just took a
harvest down like a
month like oh, so
you're light depths all
year. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah. We also we just
use string lights for
vegging like when we
need to veg and when
we don't need a veg.
So the string lights
are kind of just in
there all the time,
but maybe we don't
use them depending on
the time of year.
And then we have
heaters, big BTU
heaters in our
greenhouse for the
winter months. But
the winter crop is
like my favorite
season to grow out
here because the
wheat just looks so
good. Is that because
you don't have to
fight the heat
obviously and you
could just let that
temp go on down
low as you want at
the end of flower.
Yeah. Yeah. So
they're only heated
to 55 through the
nights. So that's
sometimes they get
that cold and yeah,
the purple is so
purple and it's like
so frosty like and
like the nose just
like hits you in
the face. I love
the winter minus
like sometimes you
have to like go out
at 3 in the morning
and scrape snow off
your greenhouse if
it's like snowing
heavy, but that's
just kind of part of
the job. Yeah, I
think winter's key.
I love it too. The
summer you're always
just fighting sun.
It's always so damn
hot, you know, and
it's seems like it's
always easier to keep
things, you know,
kind of cool warm.
Yeah. Yeah, the
summer is brutal. We
have shade cloth on
all summer long. So
when you're running
shade cloths then
okay in the summer,
are you just fanning
just just exhaust
fanning like crazy
through the or kind
of rolling up the
sides or how do you
yeah, we have sides
rolled up shade
cloth is covered the
entire canopy. So
it's a 30% shade
cloth. Okay.
Because it gets
really hot out here.
So what about when
you black out you
doing so you're
blacking out for
flower in the middle
of summer? I know
it's got to get hot.
How does that how
you deal with that?
Yeah, so we have
auto depths. My
partner Andy. He
is like an electrical
genius. So he has
built auto depth
systems for like
super cheap. He just
built the whole
controller himself
with the circuitry
and everything and
then we just got the
motors and then just
put them on pivots.
So we can do either
right at we can go
down at like 7 o'clock
at night and get
roll back up at you
know, when it gets
dark at 9 o'clock
and then roll back
down at 4 in the
morning and get to
like 7 a.m. So
we're missing it.
They're not covered
for a long. Yeah,
that makes sense.
You got to set up to
where you're not in
the middle of this
day. And then we have
fans. We have like fans
with light traps and
you know, everything
stays pretty good. We
haven't had any like
major heat problems.
Good stuff. So to
build all that stuff
out to get it going.
I mean, we haven't
talked genetics yet.
We haven't talked.
We haven't really
talked depth and
lighting yet. So if
I have let's say to
keep it simple. I
got like a hundred
thousand dollars to
invest in this right
and I'm bright-eyed
bushy-tailed and I
think that's 10
million dollars
because it seems like
it is not. But
that's how people
kind of view it.
Yeah, definitely.
Like that's going to
go so far. So, you
know, we got it. We
got our land, you
know, so obviously
that's huge chunk
whatever that was
but but we're it's
starting to chip
away. So now that's
chipped away. We got
our infrastructure.
What kind of lighting
you know, if you're
researching things,
you know, especially
in greenhouses, some
people still want to
run the the
where the double-ended
and that kind of thing
to supplement some
individuals only want
to run LED and
obviously the sunlight
to really maximize
profits. What did
you and Andy think
about, you know, when
you're doing all this
research and what did
you end up running
with? For me, I've
always been a just a
sun grower. So like
I learned how I
learned to grow weed
was under the sun.
We all lived off-grid
and Humboldt like
most farms were off
grid. So like lighting
was like never really
out there besides like
the huge indoors where
you have a generator
the size of a truck
running your indoor
whatever but that wasn't
really common where I
like really learned to
grow. So lighting
I'm like, I feel like
I'm like not a very
good judge of lights.
I know LEDs are out
there and what I use
like I barely use any
supplemental lighting. I
use string lights. Like
I said, just like Costco
string lights to keep
them in veg or in the
summer or the winter
and then we have some
like Govitas around
and some like old-school
batwing halogens just
if we want to like pump
up some moms, but that's
about it. What I would
suggest to people if
they are really like set
on doing supplemental
lighting don't buy
brand-new try to get
try to find something
used and maybe people
talk shit about that,
but that hundred thousand
dollars you're going to
spend half of it on
lights and you know
between lights and soil
and amendments and all
the other things the
fans the dehums and
then you're not even to
harvest yet. And then
you still have to make
it through harvest and
you got to pay trimmers
and then you got to
pay all there's so much
money involved. So if
you're spending a lot
on brand-new lights, I
would try to suggest
used because there's so
many used lights out
there that are totally
fine. A lot of failed
grows where people have
there's a lot of failed
grows because they bought
brand-new lights. I
don't know why I don't
know. And you can you
know, do your own kind
of research ask some
questions, but if they're
talking about the reason
why their farm failed is
because they have russet
mites then, you know, I
probably wouldn't maybe
buy their equipment. Yeah,
like definitely sanitize
everything. I said like
I sanitize my shoes.
Like if I go to the
grocery store, I'm like,
okay, yeah, stop stop
stopping. Because yeah,
there's a lot of bugs a
lot of fungus. I feel
like there's a lot of
fungus in Oklahoma.
What about humidity? So
y'all pretty much I
guess that 100 K is
going to depend on where
you're at to Brian
because I know Oklahoma
gets humid. So I'm sure
that the humidifiers
were a nice cost and
that's probably somewhere
where you would want to
go new or what you
thought on that. Yeah,
I mean, maybe if the
dehum was used one year,
I don't know. I don't
actually have dehums in
my greenhouses. But
okay. So not so you
can get away with
open sides and fans all
the time. And every
like greenhouse farmer
I do talk to that have
dehums. They're like
they're just not strong
enough and they're like
we need more. So if
you're buying like what
five quests for your
greenhouse like that is
really expensive. It
seems almost like what
also with like outdoor
the mold issues would
be or more when the
plants are out under
the rain, you know
out in the elements.
I asked what I noticed
myself. I never really
saw where like a covered
plant and just high
humidity gave it, you
know, it for serious
issues of mold, you
know to me. Yeah, I
don't really have those
issues, you know, I've
seen like also strains
like genetics, of
course, play a huge
role, but I have a ton
of airflow. So I have
like these air tubes
that go under my plants
during the summer also.
So they go through the
plants you prune lots
of fans. So I don't
think the D humps are
necessary, but this is
also not a half a
million dollar greenhouse.
But you're getting it
done. I mean, that's
the point. The point
is I can grow in this
greenhouse is $10 as
well as they can grow
in that million dollar
whatever, you know what
I mean? It comes down
to technique and
knowing what that know
what you're doing is a
lot of it, right? Yeah,
and like those big
greenhouses have
failures too. Like,
yeah, I talked to a lot of farmers.
Those flip hands more
than people know, just
a lot of times they
don't want to change
the brand name or they
like secretly kind of
change the brand name.
So it's doing business
as and now it's
something else, but the
sign doesn't change.
There's a lot of kind
of shady stuff because
people think that you
put it in the ground
and all of a sudden
everybody's riding around
in Lambo's and everybody's
loving and want to work
together and it's kumbaya
and that's not I mean
there are teams that
work like that for sure.
I've seen some people
in Oklahoma that look
like man, those people
have it together, but
they're the minority
in that for sure.
Not the not the north.
Yeah, there's definitely
something like really
awesome. I mean, there's
tons of really cool
farms out here.
Yeah, I could name a
bunch but go for it.
You can go. I mean
again, one of the
reasons why like Marco
and I like to know a
little something about
the guests usually
before we bring them
on just so we know
like hey, they're not
behind the scenes doing
XYZ, but the way that
people spoke about you
Kimmy was like this
chick checks out before
you even know who she
is, you know, so that's
it's just something
that I think that's
how it used to be,
you know, yeah, that's
how I want to be.
Yeah, your peers is
what would continue to
allow you to find
success because they
wear your business
card. They'd be like,
hey, you know this
person check out this
part. Look what this
person just got me.
Oh man, I bet I could
take that ease and
make a little more
money for myself.
I mean, there was a
lot of things that
people needed in the
community and that
was all based on trust
and the word of
strangers basically.
Yeah, I came from a
place where like grow
every single grower
that's on your team
that grows on your
team that grows on
your team. There is
no like bad like
everyone was like
doing the same shit.
Everyone grew awesome
weed. No one was like
shit talking each
other unless it was
like for some personal
other reasons. But
you're like, yeah.
Oh, yeah, my friends
got 20 pounds and I
got 30 pounds over
here. I'll call him
up and you know, you
work together and
Oklahoma has definitely
been like, oh my
gosh, there's so much
like everyone relax.
It's cool.
Everybody's cool.
I'm really bad at
shit talking. I'm
like, oh, it's okay.
That's all good
because you don't get
anything from shit
talking. You know,
I mean, you don't get
it never gets you
anywhere and that's
not why I'm growing
weed either. Right?
Like like I also love
other plants.
Exactly.
We used to have
are really awesome
farmers out here that
I love and I'm like,
yes, like you guys
are awesome.
Do you know
because there's enough
for everybody
give it give them a
shout out so that
more people can start
to support the
brands like yourself.
Yeah.
So as far as Oklahoma
goes, we got full sun
farms. They're awesome
growing full sun.
Hell yeah, and then
we got wild native.
He's doing really cool
like nerdy soil stuff
red dirt rays.
Just golden heart.
So sweet.
We got
oh, there's so many
gonna be sad if I
forget them.
Lost Highway Farms.
They're like the
sweetest family that
they're like the
reason they got into
it because their child
needed cannabis.
So they started
growing from that
which is like dang.
That's so cool.
And like like there's
beans greens farms.
Who's like throwing
Cajun
crawfish boils, which
is so fun and
like that type of stuff
is like what I'm into
like these type of
people that aren't
gonna like
they're not like
blah blah blah like
I'm the best in the
West like oh, yeah
Native Provisions.
They're super cool and
they have like a
super fancy greenhouse
and they're putting
out fire and
they're so nice.
So
and then there's like
cool people in the
community in Oklahoma
like Dr. Pepper
Hernandez is in
Oklahoma.
She's a badass got
Brandon Rust who's
like a super badass.
So there is community
here, which is really
nice.
That's pretty cool.
So, you know what
that said I heard
one of my friends went
out to Oklahoma and
he said he get you
know, he's had a hard
time kind of finding
the fire, you know
what I mean?
Is it um, how is it
out there?
What's the scene like
if somebody just
rolls up and look
in the smoke?
Well, is everybody's
stuff kind of in a
dispensary or is that
kind of how Oklahoma
set up with the wreck?
Yeah, everyone's
stuff is in dispensaries,
but it's definitely
it seems like certain
dispensaries by
these like craft
farmers and then
certain other
dispensaries just kind
of buy whatever.
So you kind of got to
know if you're trying
to find like, yeah,
all these growers
all these craft
small-time growers
that are in there
every day with the
plants.
They kind of sell to
these certain dispensaries
that will like pay
them for their price
and like promote
them for their brand.
So,
there's not that many
but they are out
there and then
as far as like
state-line dispensaries,
I mean, I'm sure
there's good stuff.
I'm sure there's
garbage.
It all goes between
and there's just so
many dispensaries.
So like,
yeah, maybe this is
just
maybe this is a dispensary
in small-town,
Oklahoma where people
can afford
this type this price.
So they're not going
to get like the super
fancy craft growers
like out in the middle
of nowhere.
So how would
so is it set up to
where if I'm out there
and I'm a grower
of any size,
can I just make a deal
with the dispensary
and if my stuff tests
and I'm licensed
then it can get on
the shelves or how
is that process?
Yeah, you guys just
agree on a price
and so you
which is cool.
You don't need like a
distributor.
So,
but you can if you want
they do exist
or like middlemen
but you know,
if you know the dispensary
you can be like,
yeah, here's my product
and they like it as long
as it's past test
and mess in metric
you as the grower
can transfer
over to the dispensary.
Okay, transfer.
What are the what are the
like I know that
we've heard some other
guests and I think
I'm sure chat will correct
me but I thought I heard
that in
Las Vegas on a $60
sack the grower
or the the grower got
like 20 bucks
like is it y'all's disparity
that far too?
Is it it will work
close to 50-50
or anything?
I try not to think about it.
Okay, so
it's um
they definitely
let's see
I try not to do the math
too often when I'm like
you can give us round
numbers of rain.
Yeah, you can be
definitely making like
most dispensary
that they're not making
50% more won't even
look at your shit
and then
50% is the minimum
but they might you know,
oh, I mean by 50%
I mean they're going to
double it.
So they double their price
sometimes they triple it.
All right.
So I see I see a lot
of things and
and really depends on
if they're like ouncing
it out
a thing it out.
It kind of depends on
the spin dispensary too.
But I think
when it's all said
and done we probably
make
25%
of what a dispensary
see and that's what people
need to patient
buys it for
yeah, and that's why it's
so important to keep those
costs down,
you know, because it's
kind of like it as it
seems like it always is
the dispensary is kind of
have the upper hand
if you will,
you know what I mean?
There's probably
maybe so many growers
that you know, the
dispensary can get a
little choosy.
Yeah, definitely.
Yeah.
So that would be like
my thing.
I want the storefront
to you know what I mean?
So can you have the
storefront and go ahead
and grow in Oklahoma?
Yeah, you can and I wish
I wish we would have
gotten a disco license,
but
I think we're talking
with some other farmers
with maybe making like a
collective
disco or something
which would be awesome.
That was one of the
questions I had written
down for you.
If we could kind of
talk on that more
is what it kind of
takes to
can you partner up
with somebody?
Are you a licensed
are you allowed to
broker your own deals?
Or it's like look,
I know you're getting
screwed by the growers.
I'm getting screwed
by the dispensaries.
You own this piece.
I own this piece.
Can we work together
and then create
just like the old days
and create some kind of
like,
you know,
you mentioned contracts
Marco and I've said this
many times on this show
contracts are only as
good as long as you have
the money to enforce them
and a lot of the hoodies
don't have that as well.
So when you're
yeah, when you're in
these situations,
you feel like hey,
I might as well go all in
I'm giving up all of this
shit because this is my dream
and it's
in reality,
somebody else's dream
is just kind of helping
them get along to that
and I feel like that's
why so many people feel jaded.
The beautiful part
is that you've been able
to kind of see those things
it seems like for yourself
navigate that
and then find
come out basically
the other side
and you realize that
you know,
it's okay to start small.
It's okay.
Like people always apologize
to Marco and I like,
oh man,
I'm sorry.
My farm isn't that big.
That's why we're
that's why we want you
on the show,
right?
We don't want to interview
the people that are just
crushing it,
but they're at the same time.
They're,
you know,
destroying the planet
or you know,
things that don't kind of
vibe with the show
and I think the small-time
farmer,
the one that owns
their own business
should be started
to be highlighted in 2023
because it hasn't been
that way for so long.
It's been all right.
Look who has the fanciest stuff
who has the prettiest flowers
and again,
you know,
there's people out there
that are talking about you
Kimmy and the fact that
you're growing real medicine.
So it's not that you not only
have
cannabis that people want.
It's that it's actually like
changing people's lives
because it's actually making
a difference
and that was the whole point
of this.
I thought
of
especially with the
regenerative side of things
is that
we had a common enemy.
We all knew that
and we were all trying to
grow together
so that we could
you know,
the whole all boats rise
kind of thing.
Except
seems like if somebody gets
a little bit of a faster boat,
sometimes they're off,
you know,
in the community still trying
to
to make sure that everybody
else is built up.
And I like when
I see people finding success
and then continuing to
still give back
and that's something that
you know,
it seems like you're
you know,
you're finding your own
success Kimmy,
but
however, you carry yourself
Misty,
you know,
you're doing it on a
on a level that I think
a lot of people respect
and I don't hear a lot of
that
to be honest anymore.
I don't hear so many people
saying that
maybe one or two or someone's
friends,
but not the community as a
whole.
Yeah.
Well,
we
I really really like
believe in like
how
like
this cannabis plant like how
it's grown and like what's
used in it
and how it makes you feel
like I'm in it for the
patients.
I really am
I want
like if someone said my
weed like didn't treat them
well,
like
I would like go re-evaluate
freaking everything like I
want to know what went wrong.
But we I get to I get a
lot of like
time where I get to talk to
patients that do smoke my
product and they're like,
yeah,
it really like makes me feel
this way and I can like
tell them like every single
step about the plant
like because I touched that
plant from clone to finish.
I knew everything that was in
it
and how it was treated.
So
it's really nice
to like
talk to patients because I'm
like when I go to events like
I'm trying to talk to patients.
I'm not trying to
I don't feel like there's much
of it.
I'm not trying to compete with
anybody like I just want to
be in the space and
your people,
you know,
that's why that's why I mean
people people respect
people that just kind of stay
in their lane
and that's what a lot of
individuals seem like that are
finding success in Oklahoma
and smaller states like that
where you can kind of be your
own,
you know, you can kind of
create your own farm if you
have a little bit
a little bit.
You need you need some money
but but at the same time,
it's not like trying to do it
here in Colorado.
You need millions at this
point.
Yeah,
get close to something like
that.
So that's another thing that I
don't think people realize is
that
you might have the opportunity
and outlier type
setting because you live in
that state or maybe you'd be
able to move to that state
and I kind of I wanted to get
back to so if we've saved money
on our lights right and we
bought the used gavitas from
people that thought they knew
you know, they invented
cannabis and then they ran out
of money.
So we bought their gavitas.
Now we want to kind of focus on
the genetics and the seeds
from your standpoint in your
locations from California all
the way to Oklahoma as well as
the East Coast.
Are there certain is there
certain gear that you've run
the entire time that you feel
like is working in all those
locations or have you continued
to kind of modify things still
try to run certain genetics,
but then maybe try some newer
stuff out in Oklahoma.
Definitely.
I
I like get genetics from
you know old friends
from Humboldt
that are out in Oklahoma.
I'm like, yeah, what's doing
good? But talking to other
farmers is like, all right, did
this do good in the greenhouse
because Oklahoma is like 90%
ish like indoor.
So
a lot of these strains out here
are like specifically indoor
strains
which some do well outside but
Oklahoma's weather is insane.
So talking to other farmers
like hey, what what do you like
what's doing good out here?
And then also reaching out to
like local breeders that have
been here like their entire
life and have been doing nerdy
breeding projects in the
backyard.
I've gotten some of their
strains and they do excellent,
of course, because they were
bred here.
Some strain like some like
generic, you know, like I know
this is going to do good.
Seed companies.
I don't do much seed.
I do a lot of
I do a lot of clones like
Purple City Genetics has been
doing really good out here
as far as like making hash too
and like Humboldt Seed Company,
you know, you always get a good
nose and
they do good outside
pretty easy.
And then there's now I'm going
to like more Oklahoma breeders.
So I'm doing like shaggy roots.
I'm trying some random rust
stuff
and then the Lost Highway Farm.
I like shaggy roots.
Yeah, I think that's
I like personally.
Yeah.
I haven't met him yet.
I don't know how we haven't
like passed but
Yeah, you guys will buy for
sure.
Yeah, I'm growing some
Canerad
Canerad
Canerado
I have a Fatso from them and
it's like
I love it.
I know Fatso is like old but
oh my God,
that's so good every time.
That's what people want again.
We were talking about this on
the show.
I think last like the end of
last year with Marco and
myself like it seems like
the clothing industry,
you know how things change and
repeat themselves.
That's kind of with cannabis as
well.
Like it just cycles through
then certain states.
Blue Dream is popular again.
Yeah, and that was
I have a Blue Dream.
For a grower that was great.
Right?
I mean if everybody's asking
for it and we you know,
you could that was always like
the best one for most people
in the peer group is like,
all right, I might not be the
best at growing cannabis but
Blue Dream seems like she
she makes it look like I'm I
know what I'm doing.
I know.
I like
I have a Blue Dream cut and
every time I look at the plant
I'm just like,
oh my God,
it reminds me of like it was
the Blue Dream.
I grew in Humboldt when I like
was a baby grower.
They got huge and it was like
the first plant that were like
falling over in crazy storms.
I'm like ratchet strapping them
up and like
that's your plant was these
Blue Dreams and every time I
look at mine.
I'm like,
oh my gosh,
fucking Blue Dream.
I but people love it and people
keep asking me for it.
So I'm like,
okay, I guess I'm going to grow
up some Blue Dream.
I'm also growing like OG Kush
right now.
It's doing really good out here.
Where's that OG Kush from?
It is from one of my
old friends.
I bet that's some good stuff.
It's like a really good cut.
It's like
the stickiest like when I was
trimming it like
everything was like covered in
like hash.
I'm like,
this is insane.
And she loves it out in
Oklahoma too,
huh?
She loves it out there in
Oklahoma.
Yeah.
Yeah, even in the winter which
I was surprised by.
Nice.
And so,
you know,
I would say most people that
even back in the day myself
included when we had Blue
Dreams,
that wasn't Blue Dreams.
I mean,
it was whatever the hell it
was.
So
being from Humboldt,
are you able to basically kind
of bet all that and say like,
hey, I kind of need this stuff
or these like I
Golden Goat like some of the
older things.
That's what people are asking
for.
You know,
right now here in Colorado.
It's kind of like,
oh, I didn't know people knew.
So knowing the trends and
keeping up with that kind of
stuff, I think is also just
as important.
It seems like obviously,
you know, that
yeah, certain brands,
certain breeds
of seeders,
certain breeders of seeds
kind of set trends and then
the market follows years kind
of follow that wave.
Some of that continues or
some individuals are like a
one-hit wonder in the music
kind of industry.
Yeah.
What we've noticed through the
show like Bog Seeds.
Are you familiar with his work
Bushy Old Grower?
Oh, yeah, I think so.
Yeah.
Unfortunately, when people
pass away like that and then
they're not on social media
and
they're, you know,
their family members have no
incentive or anything.
That stuff kind of goes away.
But those genetics are still
hovering out there.
I know you have some seed
banks and stuff have them.
So there's some gems,
little lottery tickets,
if you will, that you can
purchase.
And that's
for a lot of us,
you know, being a small-time
farmer,
how you can kind of make a
name for yourself is if you're
able to find solid genetics
from a breeder that,
you know, the industry's kind
of respects.
Bushy Old Guy is at the top of
the list for most people
and a variety of it like
belief. I think that's another
guy out there in Oklahoma.
It comes to mind.
Are you familiar with that?
Oh yeah, he's out here.
A lot of people run his stuff.
Yeah, I mean,
he's always been such a cool
cool guy to us and explaining
stuff and breaking down the
attributes and
his point system and all.
I mean this,
I never realized that it was
on that level, but it makes
sense on why it seems like
he's hitting home runs and
other people are
sometimes hitting home runs,
but not as often as him.
Yeah.
There's so much out there.
There's so many people that
are now breeding.
So really I go by,
I definitely ask my,
all my buddies out in Humboldt
and in Maine, like,
it's good to talk to the Maine
farmers because they also have
like extreme weather
and man, some of them were
like back to growing strawberry
cough, which is like from
Vermont.
I'm pretty sure.
Like I should try that.
Classic.
I know.
I'm like, yeah.
That was like Kyle Cushman stuff,
right?
Was he the one that started
all that?
I can't.
I'm not sure.
I'm like,
I'm kind of bad with readers.
But, oh, what was the Humboldt
guy that I loved?
He did all the CBD
stuff.
Rick.
I can't remember,
but he did a lot of CBD work
and he made like Harley Sue
and Kanasu
and a Harlequin.
He like lived like right down
the road from me.
So I grew his stuff a lot.
I'm really trying to get it
back.
I'm like trying to find some
CBD strains for out
here because there's really not
many.
Yeah, we were,
a lot of that stuff is tainted
down from original genetics.
There's a gentleman here.
His name is, or goes by the
name too.
And we've talked about kind of
the lineage of that stuff where
a lot of the bigger name
companies have kind of just
taking his genetics and run
with it.
And then everything is watered
down just from something that
he has found.
Ringo.
A couple others.
Ringo?
Yeah.
I've heard of that.
Yeah.
Ringo's gift.
Like he was like,
yeah,
he was right in my area
where I lived in Humboldt
and I grew a bunch of his CBD
stuff.
But obviously,
it's been lost in the years,
but I'd love to get some of
that back.
Have you ever heard of Ben
Holmes?
That's another guy that doesn't
get enough credit.
He does a lot of CBD,
CBD,
CBG genetics.
I think it's Centennial Seeds.
If people are,
you know,
do your homework on these seeds
and breeders and stuff.
Because I think when you,
when the money goes
quick,
when you're buying a lot of
the,
you know,
10,
12 packs for a couple hundred
dollars.
Oh, yeah.
I would suggest like,
I guess if you're starting up
with, yeah,
let's say the hundred thousand
dollar budget,
like definitely I would,
I would go clone wise.
So you're kind of getting a
get like that first harvest is
going to maybe make or break
you.
So if you're running
experiments,
maybe that,
maybe that's a good project for
a little down the line.
Yeah, man.
A lot of these guys stuff.
They don't even test their
gear.
Yeah.
Let me lie.
Sorry to cut you off.
A lot of these guys don't even
put the work into the gear.
Like they're putting a lot of
these,
these seeds out
and you see too much variation
in them.
It's like,
hold on.
There's too much.
You didn't put no work here
because everything looks
different and there's 12
different plants.
Like it's crazy.
Yeah.
And then you can't take that
to market because you got 12
different
like it's supposed to be the
same, but the,
you know,
you open a bag and they look
different.
Exactly.
It's not going to go over very
well.
I think you bring up a good
point that a lot of people,
you know, when they first get
into this, they want to grow
from seeds.
They don't necessarily realize
that the variations is going to
be dramatic, especially if
they're growing regs.
Now, they got a hunt males.
They might not necessarily even
know what a male looks like
until it's too late.
So a lot of chances are kind of
going on when you're doing it
that way.
Do you choose to go with clones?
Because that way you kind of
for the most part kind of run
the math and you realize,
all right, if I don't fuck this
up too bad, I'm going to be able
to land this plane here in a few
months.
Yeah, build my perpetual
harvest.
Then again, you know, maybe put
more money into my greenhouse
at the end of the year or just
make these little improvements.
And when you're at a commercial
level, I think you have to think
obviously year by year and years
out like three years out, five
years out for the level that
you're at.
Yeah, definitely.
Like my, I was never
I'm not going to start from
seeds right off the bat.
That was always the plan was
just clones get my good genetics.
The good genetics is what's
going to, you know, I need good
bag appeal.
That's like the first thing
someone sees.
That's what the buyer sees.
It needs a good nose.
It needs bag appeal.
It needs to smoke.
So I need something guaranteed
for my first run.
So instead of gambling on
seeds, which I'm not saying
you're gambling, but you maybe
you're not maybe 50% are
fucking awesome.
And then the other ones are
not gambling.
It's a bit of a lottery ticket.
And I think people should know
that like just because somebody
has these genetics and you buy
their seeds, that doesn't mean
you automatically get that.
And when I first got into this
myself, you know, I kind of
thought that as well.
All right, I'll just buy like
five packs of this one thing
and I'm sure I'll find what you
know, whatever we're after.
That's not true.
No, it's a lot of like, yeah,
culling.
You're culling a lot of plants.
So now that I'm on my third
season here, I'm popping seeds
for the first time here to do
a pheno hunt because now my
greenhouses are set in motion.
I got, you know, I got my
clients.
They know what I grow.
They know how it looks and you
know, what can expect from me
and I didn't even with clones,
there were still some hiccups
where I'm like, you know, I
tried 30 different strains
right now.
I'm at eight strains that I'm
like, yes, I love these ones
and the rest have been
eliminated.
Yeah, you got it.
That's another thing we're
talking about on a where we're
always saying that like that
tough love like every strange
it may be somebody's favorite,
but it might not work, you know
for you or your patients or
people, you know, the demand
around you.
So, I mean, don't be afraid it,
you know, something doesn't
work, but then there's that
thing.
Do you get rid of it all the
way? Because like we said stuff
comes back around and the old
stuff is now popular again, you
know what I mean?
So as always a dilemma and you
know, you can't keep with so
many moms.
How many moms do you like
faithfully got right now?
Like that you're really keeping
I have like 40 right now.
I have a big face.
So
I definitely always kind of
keep cuts around like it is
very hard for me to like finally
like kill them 100% but
it gets gets time to where I'm
like, all right.
I definitely need to just get
rid of this.
What up Brandon?
He's really doing great things
in Oklahoma, which is so nice
and he's educating.
I think that's that's how I kind
of know that notice the
difference is like it's how is
this person kind of carrying
themselves?
Yeah education anyone that gives
out free education.
I'm like man so awesome like no
gatekeeping.
Yes, like
or education.
That's kind of like yeah, we
are everybody already knows that
I see that too where it's like
yeah, I give out education man.
That's kind of that's so basic
that I don't think that's fair
to say we got to get a name for
that education.
That's like that popcorn
education or something like
there.
It's like I read a book.
So now I'm saying it, you know,
it's like I've never done it
before that kind of education.
Yeah, like garbage.
If you've never done it before
just say it like hey, I've never
done it before.
I've heard these things
and that's why again, you know
talking to you is it's to be
honest. It's hard to find more
female farmers that want to come
on the show and kind of talk
about things.
So I really appreciate you kind
of carrying the flag for that
and you care enough to fight
not many.
There's not and Marco and I
reach out to some, you know,
more than we probably should
and they politely decline almost
every time.
So I was excited when you said
yes,
I like what y'all do like you're
putting shit out there talking
this is for everybody.
We're trying to get that out to
every single person can find
success.
I hope that the community today
sees that you're one of those
they just finding success find
in your own way.
Is it easy?
No, but we joke around if we
were selling teapots or whatever
the like the little thing is
there'd be ladies talking behind
your back because your teapots
were a little bit better than
everybody else.
So yeah, that part is going to
be no matter what industry you're
in.
Yeah, any industry has like
shit talking.
So yeah,
yeah,
definitely like a little
aggressive
but you know,
just kind of laugh it off and
most people everyone has their
own personal things are dealing
with anyways, like when you're
looking at
you know,
people talking shit.
You just gotta remember they're
humans too and probably going
through their own shit.
Whenever
you take pride and being like a
a farmer a grower like and that
you learned it like the way you
did like when you said like
going out there with a ratchet
strap in a storm like I could
just picture that like, you
know, big mama plant you like
oh, no, you're like out there
fighting it because you don't
want any that you don't want to
break.
Oh, yeah, like yeah, like the
clone the mamas, you know
running them inside.
So many disaster stories.
Exactly.
Yeah, like I feel that realness
from you man.
I think that people are really
digging that.
I know we're gonna have some
real good questions for you too
at the end.
Yeah, like anything that could
go wrong has probably gone wrong
for me somehow which whatever I
mean, I think that's like you
talk to like any think of like
an old soy farmer like listen
to his stories and he's going
to be like, right, you know,
some crazy shit.
Yeah, those are the inside
things that you only you know,
you only know when you live
that life, you know what I
mean?
You can just read that in a
book.
So, yeah.
So what other so you mentioned
the the og and what other you
know, kind of strains are like
you really growing right now.
What is Oklahoma wanting?
Is it like that really fruity
is a gassy?
What are the kind of the
numbers telling you to I mean
they want cheap.
They Oklahoma's really cool
actually because they kind of
like I don't feel like there's
trend like maybe there are
trends but they just want
something new and new and new
and some people do like to
stick with strains.
So that's why we do grow a
shit ton of variety is to like
most dispensaries.
They want a quarter pound of
this a quarter pound of that
quarter pound of this and that
so that's how you kind of sell
your whole pound is four
different quarter pounds or
something.
So you get to like I'm growing
stuff that I would you know,
usually never grow but just to
have variety.
They like strong noses and
we're dealing with you know,
our competition is indoor.
So it's got to look really
good.
It's got to be like these
beautiful crystally nuggets
got to have the shape the
structure to be able to you
know, keep selling.
So I think that you know,
that's kind of the the
president is looks good.
Smells good.
The name doesn't really matter.
Okay.
Yeah, something new and a lot
of people got to realize that
you know, it ain't all about
them high crystal strains
either.
You know, I mean like some of
this stuff like these old
school genetics like I'm
growing Fantasia genome
alchemy.
I mean crazy Terps.
I'm talking about crazy Terps
but now it doesn't have that
that new wave, you know,
frosty crystal and look at
has that good classic.
No, I call I like that.
Look that old school cannabis
look that good.
Yeah, me too.
I know it's a land race.
Yeah, got that land race
center.
That's lucky.
Speaking of Greg real quick.
Did you guys see I think
Green Source Gardens is one
of the best that group is
obviously one of the best in
the world and they just,
you know announced that some
of the genetics they were
growing were Greg's.
So I want to give him that
shout out because we've been
saying that behind the scenes
a lot of people run his gear.
He's just cool with people
being white label about it.
Like kind of just that means
like, okay, I can take that
and just call it my own brand
but behind the scenes that
the people that know Greg
and that kind of thing this
that gentleman is next level.
So genome alchemy.
I'm glad that Marco you're
running his gear because then
he gets to say see it for his
own eyes.
I think from that point on
more individuals will start
to see that just because it's
hype gear doesn't always
necessarily mean that it's
right for you.
And if you do the time to
research some of this stuff
you can find the genome genome
alchemies of the world that
are you know, just trying to
make a small living for
themselves just had a child.
So that's another reason why
I want to plug that and he's
on Dag of Love.
So, you know, full circle
kind of thing that Greg is
a great human being.
Yeah, all around.
So yeah, and that's another
thing like I think man when
you reach out to guys like
that for their genetics when
you buy a pack you're going
to come away with a lot more
than a pack.
You know what I mean?
Like they show love a lot
of these guys.
I'm not going to say every
time but and the packs are
reasonable.
Some of these packs can be
two three four hundred dollars
I've seen out there and you
know, you know and is it
worth it?
I don't know.
It depends on what you're
looking for.
But I know that there's been
from a gift.
Here's a free some free seeds
or whatever.
It has been just straight fire.
So, you know, it's kind of
like genetics are where you
find them.
It's not so much, you know,
you know, you have to have
that the high dollar name to
find good plants.
You know, I grow anybody stuff,
you know, it just takes time.
Everybody's got to get in line.
I can't grow everything at
once and I do like popping
seeds for that variety.
You might find that.
You know, I've seen a lot of
people that have popped
you might find that, you know,
that crazy turf like I had
I've reached in there and smell
a planet smell like an
electrical fire kind of like
damn. That's that's kind of
like pungent.
Well, I don't even know if I
like that but it was so unique.
I got it like try, you know,
run it and see how I like it
and probably run it again, you
know, because you never know.
Yeah. Do you ever test your
like turps that you're getting
on those or
I don't I had it
just what I entered in the
competition I got in last year,
but that I'm actually going to
get into two strains.
So that'll be my test.
I don't know. I don't like
spending money. It's like
a hundred. Yeah, I know.
Like it was all cheaper.
Yeah, I'm like it's loud.
So I'm gonna go and enter pay
that little fee and I'll get
my two free tests on my two
loudest, you know,
in my stable and then that'll
be my test.
Very good.
No, I don't do you guys you
guys. That's a man.
That's part of it, right?
Yeah.
How are y'all's turps numbers
on some of the stuff pretty
nice, right?
Yeah, it's like they're always
like in the threes three
spores.
Okay.
That's sometimes shoes.
I feel like in the summer.
They're a little less winter
winter is where everything is
like so awesome.
Everything's high.
Yeah, minus like
the buds aren't as dense or
as big but I'll take the loss
on that for like he's insane
frosty.
I'm the same way.
I rather have a little more
turp than I would size, you
know, I don't I'm fine with
that because you become you
know, you get to the point.
I mean how much can you really
consume?
You know, if it's just for you
or whatever or your
or your small group.
So yeah, I like to
definitely sacrifice everything
else, you know and quality
be the one thing I don't
sacrifice.
Yeah, definitely.
Hey guys with our show.
We're starting to take these
breaks.
We do like a smoke break.
We want to kind of check in
with our
show producer London.
There's a lot of things going
on with him and finding out
kind of where Future Cannabis
Project is headed.
You know, there's a lot of
things going on a lot of
different channels.
So I wanted to bring London
on here for a second.
So if you guys want to kind of
sit back and take a smoke break,
we're going to enjoy some of
the things that London has been
working on.
All right.
I think we're back.
Yep. There we go.
So London, if you kind of want
to come off for a second, I'd
love to talk about some of the
shows that you're doing.
I mean Cannabis for Breakfast,
you're talking to some high
level.
We always say OGs, but just
in a way those individuals are
living legends.
So I didn't realize you had
just got your kid with you real
quick.
I have to I have I have exactly
two and a half minutes until I
have to leave my house to pick
up my eldest and I have my
eldest my smallest and I have to
I have to close her now and
re-dip her because she just
pooped.
But I just go in Italy.
Go check out the other channel.
Appreciate you.
You're all fantastic human
beings. Jackalope.
I'd love to feature your farm on
Cannabis for Breakfast.
One of my other pieces of
content.
So I will be reaching out with
you to schedule a few things
this year.
Okay.
Yeah, I appreciate you all.
You guys are you guys are the
most amazing human beings.
Ciao.
Thank you, London.
Man, London and Chad, like two
of the hardest working dudes
in the game, you know, shout
out brother Chad and London.
Appreciate that.
Yeah, man. Those boys are
putting together some amazing
content. And I actually saw that
our boy Chad is a superstar over
with Mr. Grow It.
He put together like growing
dense nugs or growing big butts,
something like that.
If you guys would go check out
that video for him, that thing
is on fire.
I would say that that's almost
probably going to be like a
viral kind of video.
Chad deserves it.
You know, I have somebody that's
sitting there doing the work
and giving it right.
I mean, from what I see is on
this channel constantly,
obviously, London, same thing,
Peter.
So this is becoming something
and I hope that you guys see
we're also doing some of the
editing, improving on that.
So that is something that more
individuals tune into and see
value it.
And I guess in a way, we hope
that you guys see that we're
listening to some of the things
that you say and we're trying to
improve the show and make
breaks. So this is kind of that
inaugural show.
We won't talk about it like this
anymore, but I hope that you guys
see behind the scenes that we
really are taking this seriously.
And I think it's something in
time that will really become
something for the community.
Yes, no doubt.
And Chad just got one of his
strength.
Believe he grew some belief
seeds and belief chose his
selection as his Kool-Aid man.
And that was one that he
actually debuted on our show
when he was working with.
So big ups, Chad.
Appreciate you, buddy.
Keep growing, homie.
I love when everybody I love
growers.
Well, I love seeing when people
are put together quality like,
you know, when he was getting
interviewed for that, he put
together notes.
He thought about things and I
like to see that.
And it's just cool to see when
everybody in our little sphere
here is starting to make waves
and Chad deserves it.
Mr. Westport, dirt dork is
something that he coined here
recently, you know, just having
fun with life.
I think Mr. Westport is
definitely one of the
ambassadors for the future
cannabis project.
Definitely.
Do we have any questions per
se or just kind of keep rolling
where we're doing?
Yeah, I kind of want to keep
rolling.
If you guys have your questions,
I get them in.
I've been putting a few to the
side, but there's only been
like a couple.
So now that we've talked about
seeds, one of the bigger
problems that especially in
Oklahoma, Miss Jackalope was
that there was a lot of powdery
mildew and a lot of people were
probably not understanding how
humidity makes a difference, not
only outside to their grows, if
it's not a well-built
environment that, you know, even
outdoor environments, humidity
on certain days can actually
change your indoor environments
when things are kind of sealed
up correctly.
So I wanted to talk about all of
those nuances because I saw a
lot of first-time farmers fail
that way where they thought they
had it dialed in and all of a
sudden it looks like Christmas
morning on all of their plants
when they walked in and unzipped
the tent.
Oh, that's a bummer.
I don't, I never see powdery
mildew.
I think we just have tons of
airflow and like pruning is
really important to me.
I used to see it a lot in
Humboldt on those cold, I think
mostly cooler nights, hotter
days.
I don't know if I see much
powdery mildew.
It's on OG sometimes, but...
That's good.
And I would imagine it's weeded
its way out because there's
testing obviously now.
Oh, yeah.
When things were first kind of
kicking off in Oklahoma, it
seemed like the Wild West days
where you could just kind of
show up with a bag of stuff.
Yeah, it definitely felt like
Humboldt crazy shit for a while
out here.
And now the man's bringing us
down.
But as far as like the
environment in Oklahoma, like
the outdoor environment, it
changes so much.
So you'll have like 100%
humidity days outside.
I'm sure that has huge effects
on indoors.
So if you're indoors in what a
warehouse that was built to
maybe not be a grow, you're
going to have deeper effects
from the outside versus the
inside.
I'm not an indoor grower.
So...
Key point.
Key point.
And you know, for me, man, it's
always been an environment with
PM.
It's like that cool moist.
If it's cool and moist, it's
great.
I think it's like such an
airflow thing.
Exactly.
You can, and sometimes if you're
too cool and too moist, you can't
even fight it with airflow, you
know?
So you got to evac that air and
get that kind of dry air in
there and don't, you know, you
know.
I haven't had it.
It's been a long time because
you learn that the environment
is key.
So you don't even really start
your, you know, environment is
built in, you know, when I build
up my growth, the environment's
built in.
So when I'm planting, I'm ready.
You don't plant and then see
shit happening and then try to
adjust it, you know?
Yeah.
Get you get ahead of the game.
And that's what you learn over
time.
Sometimes people get ahead of
themselves.
They just want to get growing.
I get it.
But then you kind of grow
yourselves in the issues and
then you kind of chase those
issues and you can't even really
enjoy the experience.
So take the time, set up that
environment.
When you go in there, you feel
good.
Plants are going to feel good.
You know, your growth should be
one of your night wherever you
live.
You should just be able to go
on your own and feel like it's
refreshing.
You know what I mean?
For the most part.
So Kimmy, when you started to
take down your plants, humidity
and everything is obviously key.
Where are you focused at?
Like, are you, did you have like
a small little built out room or
do you kind of make shift stuff
during each flip?
And then of course you need that
space to do something else with.
How is your operation and kind
of can you guide more
individuals into what the best
way to do it on a budget would
be?
For like a grow room or a dry
room type situation?
For a dry room and where those
metrics should be to find
success.
Yeah.
Okay.
So you need to make sure for me,
I was always making, we got a
building like a like metal
building financed for us
somehow.
I don't know how they financed
this, but they did.
So we got a building finance and
that's our dry room.
But the main thing was it needs
to be big enough in the
emergency that you need to chop
down every single flowering weed
on your property because maybe
some, because the weather or
something.
That was like always my biggest
thing.
Like we need to have a dry space
big enough in case the worst
case scenario.
So we have a perpetual harvest.
So we're harvesting about every
six weeks.
So the dry rooms mostly filled
or being bucked down into totes
and then that's being shimmied
into trimmers.
So it's kind of that whole
perpetual cycles in that whole
multipurpose room, but it's
mostly a dry room.
As far as like a cheap easy
solution, I think you could do
shipping container and make sure
it's insulated and make sure
you can keep eye dry at 65
degrees and 55 humidity.
And our room is like incredibly
insulated, insulated and sealed
like super because like I said,
Oklahoma has the extremes.
It has the hundreds and then it
then it was like what negative
20 windchill last month.
So have that dry room prepared
before you're chopping down is
really important because you
don't want to be like shit.
I need to chop everything down
right now and you've nowhere to
put it.
But you know, I've seen like
what back in Humboldt people
just used to dry and like open
open air sheds.
So, you know.
In the sun.
I never saw it in the sun, but
I saw that even here in Colorado
like people be growing in
garages, but these were
dispensed, you know, supposedly
like legal spots here in the
early days here.
Yeah, the windows had obviously
like just regular glass.
Very interesting on what the
community as a whole knowledge
is and then once the farmers
like yourself and others seems
like they start to get a track
hole find success.
So like those kind of
individuals fall to the wayside
so it doesn't really matter.
It doesn't really matter at
first as long as you are putting
in the work you kind of ahead
of the game compared to most.
I truly believe that when I
saw people in Oklahoma, they
thought, hey, I'm putting a few
plants in the ground and we're
all going to be rich and we're
all going to be hanging out at
the Hard Rock Cafe.
So it seems like the only place
that's the only place anybody
goes in that town.
Hard Rock Casino, man.
I've never been.
I want to.
Yeah, that's like the Vegas
Strip.
Boom.
I'm from Reno, Nevada.
So Casino is a very special
place in my heart.
Oh, yeah.
The shittier the better.
The rooms are usually nicer the
further away it is from the
Strip.
You know that Red Rocks.
There's like a Red Rocks one.
Oh, Red Rock over there in
Vegas.
It's out there.
Yeah, it's out there but that
shit is nice man.
Be honest.
Yeah, we used to like going
there. That's real chill.
Did you guys have a grow in
Vegas or?
No, no, we just travel a lot.
Or used to I guess.
Yeah, Vegas is something.
I worked at a commercial spot
out there helped them get going
in Vegas, indoor.
Yeah, and that was like wild,
you know, I mean it was like I
said, the regs were ridiculous.
And one of those things where
these, you know, the ownership
you go into it thinking one
thing you got organics, you
know, and the name that's that
fits me and then they end up
going, you know that whole
other way.
So you got to watch that too
out there people have that
bait and switch.
Yeah.
So then obviously you're
starting to you have a name for
yourself. You're building at
that up.
Do you have like an idea behind
the scenes when you guys were
coming with, you know, you have
all this stuff being built out.
So when did you start to
realize? All right, we're
probably going to need a logo.
We need some kind of like
branding and things behind that
and what were your thoughts on
that? And if you could give any
advice because that's also like
you can grow the best weed.
We talk about this all the time,
but if nobody knows about it
just sits on the show.
Yeah, I feel like that is like
maybe the hardest part of it
all for me personally because
I'm like, I was like, you're
not allowed to even take
pictures of these plants.
And now I'm like putting this
shit on like social media going
from like secretly doing it to
this like huge public space is
challenging for me, but I did
realize, yeah, we need to put a
picture to the face or a face
to the name. We have to get out
there. Instagram literally like
sells a lot for me like all
these videos that I'm doing.
I make it so like if someone
buys my product, they can like
look me up and be like, oh,
that's the farm and that's what
it looks like and that's what
they're doing. But also
dispensary see that now and
they're like, oh, that's cool.
And then people ask for that.
So that's really been helping
me and then I go to some events.
I'm like so 50-50 about cannabis
events because sometimes I'm
like I feel like everyone might
just be trying to sell me
something. I'm like, I'm trying
to sell you something but I do
network, you know with people
and getting face-to-face time
and like connecting really
helps and having a brand name
to go with that that they'll
remember is important. So we
picked Jackalope Farms because
I like little critters and we
needed a name really fast like
Jackalopes are cool and you
know, they got some country
folklore and we're a bunch of
musicians over here. So that's
what we picked and we got a
really cool artist who's kind
of like on our team. My business
partner's husband is a super
good artist. So he's like does
the logoing for us and then
I'm trying to do the Instagram
as like an old millennial. It's
a struggle but it's fun and try
to keep it really positive over
there and like not play into
the Instagram drama, which you
can always see but really the
Instagram is for the patients
to see what we're like and I
don't think they really care
about, you know, meat industry
drama. So try to keep it good
over there and that's really
been like really been like good
for us. So if you have a farm
or a thing of opening a farm
get a name that's like creative
and people are going to
remember and it's not too
complicated. You can make a
cool logo and then everything
is content. Branding and
transparency. Those are those
are those things for yeah for
IG definitely online online in
general. Yeah, definitely use
that, you know, and IG does
have a share of you know, drama
scenes seems like the more you
know, if you get you know, 10
followers, we'll one or two is
going to be kind of like, you
know, negative, you know, or
doesn't really it's like why
are you here? You know, kind of
thing, you know what I mean? So
I don't go places that I don't
like what's going on or what's
that? Yeah, I think that's all
social media. Like I've already
seen like comments and there's
I'm like, oh gosh, you know,
like someone's going to hate
you no matter what you're
doing. Yeah, no doubt. So you
kind of got a ride with that
ignore the hate, you know, keep
keep pushing through if you're
if you're sharing the info is
your thing and that's what you
want to do. Yeah, definitely.
Yeah. And I agree man. Like
it's a great branding is key.
Like I was surprised like I was
looking at some rules for some
upcoming cannabis events and
actually the name of the strain
is is gets 10 points, you know,
I mean, so like, you know, I
always grew up saying well,
we're really what's in a name,
you know, because yeah, right
now the name gets 10 points out
the gate. So that's kind of
that's just how the I guess the
world we're living in now, you
know what I mean? That's
interesting. I have not.
But yeah, it's all about
branding like
being like
like you want people to remember
your name go into the dispensary
ask for you.
And these big like yeah, these
huge people in suits. That's
their main thing is branding.
They get like these cool Mylar
bags and they put their name
freaking everywhere everywhere,
you know, t-shirts stickers.
There's in your face. So like
of course the consumers that's
what they're going to remember.
Remember, so we're trying
right? I'd love to get better
at it.
It takes time, you know, I'm
almost like right. Let me hire
a young and to take, you know,
help me out with that or just
knock it out. You know what
I mean? Because they do things,
you know, as far as that social
game seems like the younger
they are the faster they do
it even like like to have to
the babies like you'll see a
baby's, you know, pick up a
phone and be open and start
doing things. I know it's
crazy. Yeah, they're fast with
those things. Yeah. I'm always
joking. I'm like I need like a
20 year old around here to do
this video stuff for me. Exactly.
They're out there. You just
gotta find it find that right
one. And if you're anything
like me, you want somebody that
kind of gets it and knows like
I just don't want some a body,
you know, if you get what we're
doing it, it makes them make it
a lot easier because then you
understand what the content is,
you know, so try to pair up
with somebody that can, you
know, help you on that end
could be dollars well spent,
you know what I mean? I'm sure
I haven't really thought about
it, but I'm sure if you for
each hundred bucks, you know,
spent on that if they were
they're good on the internet
could probably transfer to more
than that in dollars, you know
what I mean? Yeah, come out of
head. There are like weird
things with having the cannabis
farm on social media, like
you're shot. Like I know I'm
shadow ban, so I don't get the
reach that yeah, the third farm
would get. So I don't think
it's like worth paying anyone
to like do the Instagram type
stuff for me or you're probably
right being exceed. Now, we
just learned that product wise
somebody just be like, oh,
yeah, I could spend all this
money and what a thousand
people are going to see it
that probably might not even
live in the state. So the
people that do follow me, I
think my percentage is pretty
high in Oklahoma. Correct? And
those are the ones that are
going to be buying your product
anyway, like someone like
Brian, you know, online
seller, you know, countrywide,
you know, nation. Yeah, that
dollar spent that way would
probably transfer a lot more
to product. So that's where
you got to get in business.
Are you on Tick-Tock yet? No,
I'm not Brian. You probably
are aren't you? I was I was
on Tick-Tock, but there's
there's not enough time in my
day to start that. I know
all that Tick-Tock though.
Now, and again, we talked
about this. I think focusing
on your website, especially
when you're first getting into
this is probably a better ROI
unless you're in the cannabis
game. Then Instagram is king
because there's nobody else
for cannabis, you know, to
show off your pretty flowers
and your amazing farm and all
that. So it's a necessary evil
when you're first starting out,
I think. Yeah. And then when
you get to a certain level,
like Marco, you know, he seems
like he was able to retire,
you know, just kind of walk
away on top Michael Jordan
style. Yeah, you're not
coming back. Are you? I mean,
I probably I might man. I
ain't sure. You're on the
island right now. You know,
you're not you're not in that
sphere anymore. And I bet it
feels great. I like doing this.
And actually the funny thing
is I keep looking at it like
so when you on your account,
it'll say you reach this
many thousand people this week.
Right. And then so when I
when I first got off, it was
like a high number. I don't
even remember. But now it's
like down to like six hundred
and fifty one. I just looked
at it. So I'm like, let me
see what happens when it goes
all the way down where I
didn't help any. I didn't
reach anybody, you know,
pockets and then open it back
up. I don't. Yeah. That's
just like part of this game
that I'm like, man, I know.
I don't know. Yeah. And I'm
mad at them. I mean, not mad,
but it's like the work you
do doesn't really doesn't
really. I don't know that it
really factors into Instagram's
algorithm, like because you
can show a reel of someone
peeling a banana and it gets
a million views where you sit
there and spend two hours
preparing an IMO or something
and it gets this many views.
So it's like, you know, why
it gets kind of like to that
point in life is like I got
a certain amount of time in
my day and I'm not spending
a lot of it sitting there on
my phone. Now I'm actually
doing a lot more things in
real life. Yeah, you know,
kind of day to day. I need
to take care of. Right.
Like, all right. I have 20
minutes to make this thing
for this website and then
I'm freaking out. And if
it's bad, then it's bad.
If it's not, whatever. Yeah.
Yeah. And so, yeah, that's
what's kind of where I'm
at with it, man. You know,
I do. I'll probably come
back on there, you know,
sooner, sooner or later
for sure. And but I want
to come back with like
showing kind of some more
progress on my farm, you
know, my pond where I have
love that. Yeah. You know,
these things would get
kind of set up now and
then we're more showing
function and then, you
know, kind of like, oh,
look what I did today.
I built, you know,
movies wrapped around,
you know, I want to grow
more plants and show,
you know, kind of working
the land more. So we'll
get there. Cool. I want
to put in a pond soon.
Yeah, you got to have
that water, man. It's
just like something about
that. It brings a lot of
wildlife there too. Yeah,
that's awesome. Yeah.
Yeah, I was surprised. I
finally got the liner in
like late in the summer,
almost fall. It was really
cool. And frogs made their
way into the pond before
winter. It was wild.
Yeah. Anyway,
so kind of a kind of
closing out this, would
you say that when you're
when you're building up
everything in general,
you're building that brand
awareness in your opinion
going to the shows and
the expos, you said, you
know, about half the time
you like doing that. Have
you found a way to kind
of maybe track that where
somebody gives you like a
coupon code and it's like,
Hey, I met you at this
place. Have you ever tried
anything like that? And
did you find success?
I mostly track it by like
sales. So like I'm so
small that I know like
who I met at each event,
like and really it's only
dispensary owners that I
can sell to. So from that,
that's where I can track
like, oh, this event was
great because I got to
talk to people, local
people. Like so there's
like these big expos around
the country. Those aren't
going to do me any good
at all. I'm not going to
talk to anyone in Oklahoma.
Maybe a couple, but local
events where there's other
industry people there,
that's where I find the
most beneficial. And then
also patient events.
There's this like organization
called Dope Women in Weed
and they have really good
events where if you have
a table, like how the
event is set up, like
every single person at
the event has to come to
your table and talk to
you. So you get this
huge, you get this
personal one-on-one time
with everyone there. And
that has like really
helped and got me in
front of a ton of
patients. So events like
that, I'm like, that's
super awesome and it has
helped me, but I don't
have a coupon code and
maybe I should do
something like that.
Are you allowed to give
samples out of events?
Is that no? Okay.
Not legally. Okay.
So then you can, okay.
So then I'm just looking
at the business. So you
sell to the dispensary.
Now it's almost in
your best interest to
still promote your
flower on the streets.
If you will, here's
where you can get my
stuff because you want
them to sell out and
they got to come back
to you. Well, that's a
nice thing. Yeah. With
the dispensary owners,
you can be like, this
is my reach with
patients. So if you're
the only person selling
my product in this area,
I can send everyone
in that area to your
dispensary. Say like a
small, you know, Eastern
Oklahoma, like, okay,
there's one dispenser
we were at in, you
know, this 30 mile
radius, all those people
I send to you and then,
you know, and so on.
And, you know, bigger
cities, you know, we
work with three or
four dispensaries. And
it's worked out pretty
well. And like we get
feedback from dispensaries
that say, yeah, people
come in and ask for
your stuff because you
sent them there because
they talk to you via,
you know, either at
one of these events or
like the internet.
Yeah.
And then they buy more
weed.
Exactly. And then it
just kind of compounds.
And when you imagine
when you get a really
good strain or a good
crop that, you know,
that, that then, like
you said, he's selling
more yours, he wants
more. So y'all can kind
of build a relationship
on that.
Yeah. We do like kind
of buildups, like we
do like release dates.
So like once everything's
ready and we're ready
to like hit the shelves,
we've been like promoting
it for X amount of
weeks. And then we're
like, all right, it's
available now, hit me up
can kind of deal with
running it all around
the state.
There you go. Yeah,
because you want to focus
on growing that quality
too. Like there's, you
know, that you can only
stretch so thin, you
know what I mean? So
sometimes, so you're
gonna have that team
don't put something out
like if you are not
backing up that product
100% do not put it out.
Like that's what I would
definitely suggest to
people that are trying
to start start up if
you're like, oh, this
didn't turn out so good.
But I'm going to try
to sell it anyways and
like oversell it like
this is the best stuff
ever. Like people know
people are smart and
they're going to remember
that if there's something
that I'm not super
proud of, I'm like, you
know, I'm not I don't
like this. And I'll
either be like, I'll be
but it out or I'll, you
know, it just gets
thrown away.
Oh, you can't go. What
is your what be but it
out? Like be buds like
small buds. Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Just tighten it
up real tight. Yeah.
Yeah. I'm like, ah, you
know, something I'm
not stoked on. It won't
be on the shelf. Yeah,
I imagine man, that
could be kind of
embarrassing to get
your shit left on the
shelf. Like, but I
guess your deal is
you it's sold once you
give it to the dispensary.
Now it's on him. He's
got a seller to do
his thing, right? Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Take the
loss where I would
like be bummed was if
a dispensary owner ever
came back to me and
we're like, we are
like not satisfied with
this product and that
hasn't happened. So
yeah, that would hurt
and I'd be like, damn.
And you know, we love
working with smaller
dispensaries and you
know, we'll do pop-ups.
We'll go hang out. We'll
go play music at the
shop and you know,
talk with people and
you know, that's just
like my type of business.
Like I'm not really
trying to be like a
super mega farm. Like
I'm doing this as a
lifestyle. Like I like
how I live. I like
having quality product
and quality time. Yeah,
you can pick your day.
Yeah, you know, it's
a lot of hard work and
it's a lot of like,
you know, not a lot of
sleep and sometimes
you're doing like the
stupidest shit over and
over and again and
things are breaking and
you're like, why am I
doing this? You know,
how many broken
waterlines can you have
in one year? A lot.
But it's, you know,
I like living this way.
I like living in the
woods. I like hanging
out with my friends
and my dogs and
getting to pick my day.
So. It's picking up
like picking your day
and all that. Are you
then taking it to the
next level and washing
everything yourself?
And where are you
moving? Yeah, we got a
processing license. So
I mean, I used to make
hash back in Humboldt.
Like making ice hash
was like just what you
did. So it's this
full, this full circle
thing again, where it's
like, okay, now hash
and rosin are popular
again. And sure, we
were doing like dried
trim back then, but
it's not much difference
washing, you know,
fresh frozen material,
you know, same, same,
you know, type of
washing. So now we're
just watching fresh
frozen and that's cool
and we're experimenting
and we're getting
really pretty stuff and
that will be coming
out soon-ish, you know,
we're dialing it all
in. Like a lot of
this winter stuff is
so nice. I didn't want
to wash it. So
yeah, I think you
got to have that option,
right? Probably like
a summer crop, like
outdoor. Just for
washing? Yeah. Okay.
That's cool. Gives you
that option. So you
don't take that L,
you know what I mean?
You got a little bit
of play if things don't
go perfect for you.
Yeah. Yeah, it's just
like really dialing
in how you want to
like live your life.
I think when it comes
to like maybe starting
small because basically
starting you're like,
I feel like you're
signing your life away
for a while. Like,
all right, my whole
focus is going to be
this if it's like just
you and a couple
people. And sometimes
I wish I like would
have gone in with some
people, you know, that
I've met nowadays.
But I didn't meet them
then, which is kind of
unfortunate because
then you could rely on
someone else. But you
know, like it's always
good to just like have
your shit and take care
of it. Yeah, I think
the week I've seen
the most success from
my friends and peer
groups and their friends
when they're the one
growing the product
and then washing the
product, whether they're
an underground individual
or they have a commercial
team. As long as it's
in-house because there's
a lot of finger pointing
if something happens.
Yeah. Yeah. And then
everybody's pissed off
for really no reason
because it's just, you
know, hopefully it's
just bad communication.
Yeah, it's usually I
swear it's usually
communication and like
maybe someone expected
someone had higher
expectations and then
they let themselves
down or someone else
let them down and
that's where it can
suck. At the level
that you're at, what
percentage for washes
do you need to kind of
get a solid return and
what's the future of
that you think for
moving forward? If I'm
growing it to wash
it and I'm sacrificing
like flower space. I
think I would need like
a 3% or more. And
it would have to be
have to have that
nose. So, so if you
found a 5% or you'd
be crushing it, right?
Yeah, just how the
laws are in Oklahoma
like just right now.
But if it changes
which it could be
changing where we're
going to be charged
per square foot, which
a lot of states do.
So a lot of things
I'm saying are like
pertaining to just
Oklahoma laws and you
have to look at each
state. So with Oklahoma
if it goes up and I
have to pay more money
per square foot, then
I'm going to be investing
in what's going to be
like moving the fastest
and the most which
could be concentrates
at the time or it could
be flower. Right now
the flower is doing
really good for us
just because how we've
been promoting it and
people like it and it's
really what I've been
doing for you know, 12
years. So that's my
specialty is like
greenhouse flower
greenhouse organic
flower. So I love
doing that. Hash making
is like not quite my
passion, but I will do
it and I really love
other hash makers that
do it because I think
it's so cool and I
really appreciate all
their hard work.
Definitely. I don't
think people realize
what kind of work
that goes into and
again with the
miscommunication when
you're washing that
the proofs kind of in
the pudding when you're
finished. So in a way
sometimes you have to
tell a friend or a
homie. Hey, your flip
wasn't that great this
time or you're not
doing the stuff that
we need you to do to
be in this little group
and I think yeah,
there's a lot to that
and ego and all the
little behind the
scene things.
Our egos are amazing.
Yeah, a lot of chefs.
You ever seen chefs?
Yeah, that's kind of
the same way. Yeah,
like I've been washing.
I've been testing all
my strains and doing
like fresh frozen
washes just to see like
what we're working
with and what you know
what quality is going
to be coming out and
there's some things
are like this one's
going to wash so
awesome and it's going
to smell so good and
like it's like my
favorite strain and
that was of all the
ones that like were
like not good like
that was the lowest
producing one and I'm
like, ah kind of
heartbroken, but you
know, it's just the
way the cookie crumbles,
but then there's one
that I was like,
whoa, I cannot believe
how much this is like
pouring out and like,
you know blonde and
beautiful.
So it just kind of
just kind of like that
you don't know until
you know, and I'm
definitely looking
into more like hash
breeding strain or like
strains that were
bred for hash like
that's a whole nother
Avenue first strains
bred for flour as you
guys know.
Oh, yeah, and a whole
nother skill set to be
honest. I mean, there's
a lot of little tricks
and ways that I think
the elite farmers are
finding to really keep
those turps so that by
the time it does get
to the consumer. It's
like wow, this does
just have a little bit
of a longer smell
and enticing smell
than the other jar
edges.
Yeah.
So are you allowed?
I think when I was
there Oklahoma was
are you allowed to like
crack open a jar and
smell that or is it
like hey, I take that
eighth and they give it
to you and then you're
out the door and you
could see what you get.
We still have deli
style which they
tried to get rid of but
a couple people in
the industry like we're
down at the Capitol
just talking to all
these people and like
got that thrown out.
So we still have a
deli style, which is
so awesome.
That's good.
It's unique it seems like.
Yeah, it is unique and
it'd be a bummer if it
went away, I think.
You get to see quality
and allow the consumer
to see it.
Say and smell it.
Yeah.
Yeah, less packaging
and you know all that
is like a headache to
me and I think consumers
like to see the weed
of course.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Deli style.
I like that.
So they just go in the
jar and grab.
Yeah.
I mean there are people
that do do like the
pre-eights or ounces
or anything.
So you could send your
pre-done jars in there.
Is that how that works?
Okay.
Yeah, you can do both.
Okay.
So the laws are fairly
cool.
They're always changing.
It is like changing
all the time.
So there's like what
we had to put a sign
on our public road
that says, you know,
road that says we're a
grow with all of our
grow information,
which that's now a law
which kind of sucks
but come rip us.
We're right here.
Come Rob us right here.
That's crazy.
That's not a good rule
and then we work that
one.
Were you were you
forced to put in like
a security system
and were you forced to
buy an expensive one?
Yeah, I got lucky on that.
My partner Andy.
He is he does
used to do security systems.
He's MacGyver.
He is fucking MacGyver.
Yeah, this guy has like a
guy.
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, he's great.
So he like
like he builds the light controllers.
We need out of like little
parts and gizmos
and you can build
all the he built all the automatic
depth controllers
and it's a really great
thing to have around
because I'm like, can you build
this for me?
And he does it really fast.
So with the security systems
are required.
So we I mean we
got one off like Amazon
that he picked was
like a good one
and then we have a third-party
alarm company.
So,
you know, if we're not here we
lock up everything if any sensors
get pulled an alarm goes off
cops get called while they call us
first and then
ask us if we want to call the cops
or something.
No.
Yeah,
and then we have
then we have to have these fucking
fences around everything which
drive drives me insane.
But
we have to have them.
So what y'all's fence requirement
like height
six foot with two feet of barbed
wire.
Oh damn prison.
So ugly.
No, right.
I'm putting flowers around the
entire fence this year
as well.
Can you let vines grow on it?
Like you have like a tree
on it like you have,
you know,
I mean what they can come drip
them down if they want.
That's a morning Glory grow on
there.
But yeah,
yeah.
Yeah, I'm going to do
instead of expanding cannabis
production.
We're actually expanding into
cut flowers and like peppers
and vegetables
Oh,
I can't wait to watch you because
I that's something I wanted to
dig into and it's not as easy
as you think man.
Yeah,
not you personally,
but it wasn't as easy as I
think I thought you could just
plant these long stem,
you know decorative flowers
and they all grow but there's
art to that too guys.
You got it like then shit out
and you know,
it's nice.
Oh, yeah,
it is like
there's like weed breeders and
stuff but like flower farmers
are like serious.
They
and they know like so many
different like
types of flowers.
It's not just
well,
I'm a I'm also getting married
this year.
So I'm learning about what
flowers cost when they're at
like max retail.
Yeah,
it is unbelievable.
So
yeah, if you can grow some fancy
ass flowers and
probably build yourself a little
e-commerce site.
Yeah,
there's money in that for sure.
I just want to grow something
that's not like regulated
because I'm
it's like draining on a person
to like have to jump through a
million flaming hoops to bring a
product to the table.
Isn't it crazy?
They make doing it quote unquote
the right way the hardest way to
do it.
You know, I mean like doing it
what they call right is the
fucking hardest way.
You know, I mean you already
know how to grow,
you know how to do everything.
I don't need all this fence and
barbed wire and alarms.
I get it.
I like green plants like okay.
It's a keeps the deer out but
yeah, it's just another expense.
But hey, it's one of those
expenses once you buy fences
there, you don't have to buy it
again.
So I guess yeah, we got it.
We got ours for a really hot
deal.
So that's another thing is like
yeah, when you're building
you know, if you're starting a
regulated farm, you definitely
need to think about these costs
like you're fencing fencing is
expensive so expensive and
we ended up getting a used fence
and it was a bitch
Andy put it out for Andy.
Yeah, I helped a little bit but
always like all the plants need
help.
What sounds like you know when
you need to find a way it sounds
like you and Andy, you know,
we're up to the challenge and I
think that's what a lot of
cannabis farmers used to kind of
find alluring is
kind of on the fringes of life
anyway, sometimes I think that's
how cannabis farmers at least
started out.
You kind of like that in a way
and so you're willing to trade
risk for the freedom of being
with plants and enjoying that
that life and then or at least
for us Endeavor seemed like they
were dangling it like yeah, now
you're going to be able to enjoy
your life and grow plants on a
huge 10,000 20,000 square foot
facility and that isn't the
you know, the goal.
I think the reality is small
time farm.
That should be what people find
to see as success is that you
own it yourself.
Not how big you manage, you know
30,000 square feet that isn't
that's not really going to relate
when you get laid off or things
go South between you and that
individual where when you run
your own farm and it sounds like
Andy puts in the same amount of
time that you do not everybody
does that.
So I think that kind of breaks
things too, but both people are
putting in the where you know, I
respect you.
You respect me.
I'm showing up for you.
You're showing up for me.
Yeah, that that goes a long long
way in the in the cannabis phase
because that's what farmers need
of each other, especially if we
were going to you know, we're
going to share the profits that
we have to share the workflow.
Yeah, and there's so much work.
It is endless.
I can think of a million things
right now that I have to do and
that's fine.
And yeah, just finding your type
of people that you like and you
know, maybe not expecting that
you're going to all have private
boats soon sooner than later.
Yeah, it takes a lot but also
yeah, I don't I could easily go
get a big time grow job at a
huge facility, but I just don't
want to do that.
That's like sounds like a
nightmare to me.
Like I don't want to do that.
I like I like how I picked my
you know, my farm.
I'm lucky enough to do it.
Yeah, money isn't everything if
you have no time, you know,
and especially if you have no
time you're getting paid
decently, but it feels like
you're just constantly giving
giving giving to some kind of
brand or corporation.
Yeah, you're making someone else
rich.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Got pay ourself first.
That's why you buy a used fence
and put it up yourself, you know,
when you starting out, you know,
I said, you just can't start out
with the big shiny truck all the
time. You know, I mean, you got
to get get in the game start
working.
Use truck works.
Man.
I had my truck 10 years and that
shit is solid.
It's an old old Dodge diesel.
Yeah, never shutting down
and then I just look get a
little fuel of diesel and she'll
keep on doing her thing, you
know, and then one day you
grow. You just upgrade guys.
You grow into shit.
That's what that's what happens.
You get to where you just need
that truck. I need to go longer
distance. This one ain't getting
me there. I need to haul
something heavier than you
upgrade again, you know, that's
just called growing into things.
You don't know everyone looks at
our day.
My final goal.
I want to be this big CEO of
this big grow and with all these
big toys, but you got to grow
to that.
You know, I mean, if that's your
goal, you know, I mean, so
starting out humble starting out
used man, that's all good.
That's all good money.
It all pays us, you know, it all
pays you first.
Yeah, I want to like remain
sustainable in my life.
Like I don't want to like sell
out burnout.
You know, I want to sustain.
I want to make this place a
beautiful place.
That's not like destroying the
entire planet.
That's super important to me.
So I'm not going to do everything
that a commercial girl would do
because of those reasons like
like no way.
I'm never going to like spray
something really bad on my
plants.
I'm not going to use these
plastic bottles all over the
place because it's just like not
what I'm into and I really like
looking at other farmers besides
cannabis farmers.
Like I'm looking at Market
Gardener vegetable farmers and
so many other people that are
doing agriculture are doing so
many cool things and I'm trying
to kind of blend it all together
in a permaculture way.
That's just I'm like a weird
nerd in the mountains.
So are you are you getting into
did you say Market Gardening as
well?
Just flowers.
I think in some herbs and then
peppers.
I want to do a ton of fabric
because we got a friggin freeze
dryer.
So yeah, you might as well and
someone gave me that advice too.
They said cut flowers is key.
Like you'll never see that
person like taking their flowers
home from the from the local
farmers market or whatever on a
Sunday or Saturday.
Yeah, they sell out.
Yep.
That's everything I hear.
I'm not saying that like that's
not another job in itself like
cut flower farmers that is hard
friggin work too.
So yeah, but we're gonna do some
easy ones like just on the side.
Yeah, some fun stuff and you'd
be surprised you can grow some
nice once you start grouping
them together.
It starts looking like something
you don't mean you take that one
little flower you can like and
other medicinal herbs because I'm
like way into herbalism not just
cannabis like
that whole other there's a whole
other side of it all that I want
to do.
So all I know is add baby's
breath every time you want to
make something look pretty put
some baby's breath in that shit.
There you go.
She likes you have been wedding
wedding shopping.
Oh my gosh, you can lift this.
Yeah, there's a lot of ways to
make suit stuff super fancy.
Yeah, I think that might be the
new frontier for people that can
really build their soil systems
get the colors, you know, the
genetics they probably have to
obviously going through that same
way find the right genetics to
get the colors to pop have the
prettiest flowers on the block
and then you know for some ladies
not my wife thankfully but for
some ladies they go like crazy
all out where it's almost you
know unmanageable the budgets
and those kind of things where
seems like if you do your
homework you can find
individuals.
I found that Costco actually has
the prettiest flowers for the
lowest price.
Oh yeah.
And I got the lowest gas.
Where are you located?
Denver Colorado.
Oh Denver.
Nice.
I grew up in Denver.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
We don't have good weed and you
know I felt like we did for a
little while and then it's gone
back more to the gray market
where people that are doing it
the right way don't want social
media don't want to talk to
anybody just want to live in the
mountains and do their thing.
I get that.
Yeah that's why I was bringing
it up.
I think there's a lot of
individuals like yourself that
are just putting out quality
product and I hope that our
viewers see that as well that
Instagram isn't the be all end
all of bright minded individuals
or people that are putting out
fantastic product.
You need to kind of spread your
wings a little bit go to some
more of these expos and stuff
because that's why I've seen a
lot more of the mountain type
individuals are willing to come
to some of the expos.
We had that big one in Denver
it was called Indo Expo.
I saw a lot of like overalls
that's how I know a huge beard
overall.
It's like man I know.
Dirty boots.
Smart.
Yeah.
They I think people a long time
ago maybe misunderstood that
that would have been the plug
for you.
You know I was that guy in the
muddy boots with the overalls
not that guy.
Oh yeah.
The dirtier you know they know
that.
I feel like I'm a dirtball
compared to everybody but
whatever.
We're dirt dirt dorks as Chaz
kind of pointed out.
I like that.
All right so get your questions
in and then we got to keep this
kind of short.
Marco said he's got to do some
stuff and I know I'm already
running late now.
Y'all got me.
We're in that flow man with the
hours.
I didn't even realize that we're
just rolling on.
I like it.
Yeah.
What are you supposed to be
doing.
I got to go do a little bit of
family things.
Nothing too crucial but I was
trying to just give myself some
you know set myself a time limit
this.
What happens is the guest is
always great like you are.
We just run along.
So it's all good.
I appreciate y'all for having me
is.
Exactly.
You're around Oklahoma.
Totally come visit.
Of course.
I think it's important for more
individuals to see that.
The dream can be.
Be realized you know you're
living it for yourself but it's
not like you know you click your
heels and all of a sudden you
know in a promised land there's
going to be a lot of ups and
downs.
And then once you get to that
point and you're starting to make
money you know more obstacles
come your way.
So it's not always.
There's a lot.
I don't know.
There's just a lot to this and I
hope after today more people
realize that maybe growing in
your basement is is the ultimate
dream and because you get to
control it you get to fund it
yourself.
You don't have anybody telling
you what to do and you'll find
success I think a lot faster that
way when you know your own work
ethic and you know if you're
waking up every morning and
you're and you're motivated
you'll find your own way and
you'll find people that want to
buy your cannabis because not
everybody lives their life in
that manner.
No cannabis even to this day
here in Denver is still a hobby
for a lot of people and if you
actually saw their gross they're
not they're not pretty.
So when they're a licensed
commercial facility those are
the ones that I think you
should listen to and then try to
emulate that as best you can
or your basement.
Yeah and everyone should home
grow.
I'm like all everybody.
Anyone can ask me.
I'm not very good at indoor
probably the first to admit but
if you ever want outdoor plant
advice holler at me.
I'll be hollering at you.
We're outdoors about to be
cranking up before long.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's get it.
Make some monsters.
I'm going to grow some old
school humble monsters out here
this year.
So one thing I always wonder is
you know how.
So what I ask the people to grow
them.
How do you grow those monsters.
What's the key is it starting to
plants big young or what.
Usually in humble I would start
in like March but I'm going to
start like this week.
I'm starting some plants and
then enough root space I think
OK root space is a huge thing.
So I'm going to have my I'll be
in Google pits because that's
kind of my option here.
So we're building a ton of more
like smaller not Google pits but
Google road type things around
here which all plus a bunch of
videos of course on the steps of
building those types of things
and we're just going to plant
them up and then also I think
pruning stretching lots of
layers of trellis for doing the
monsters and then I used to only
feed compost tea but they were
like nutrient compost teas.
That's what I spent a lot in
humble for the like 20 footers
which those are cool but they
are not really fun to work on
they look so awesome.
But when you're putting one
plant for like eight hours
you're like oh my gosh this is
insane and the multiple
trellising is just basically
it's going to get heavy she's
going to get one a break and
you want every branch fully
supported early right.
Yeah.
So I like to start I'm young and
then start like weaving them
through the trellis and then
those will grow up do another
layer weave through what bottom
shoots shoot up so you're
getting like this huge round
massive monster like seven
layers opening that middle up
constantly opening that middle
yeah and like bring that middle
so you can see through it
basically.
Nice.
Some people don't but I think
environment you'd need to.
Yeah it's fine it's fun to have
some monsters.
And you guys you see clones
won't get monster status.
Boom.
That's what I needed to hear.
So pretty much you like to go
direct seed I would imagine if
you can or tiny tiny cups and
then yeah tiny cup to
transplant.
Yeah.
Gotcha.
Yeah I always did like four
inch or pot to like a three
gallon to then once they're
like branched out in the three
gallons then they're then
planted into the ground usually
that's late enough in the
season for them to not be under
light.
Okay.
Okay.
Great.
Yeah the clones like you can
get clones big but they're never
going to be as big as seed.
They seem to notice growing
clones outdoors and they were
really weren't it outdoor plants
either.
They just didn't do it.
They did.
The genetics.
Right.
Wrong genetics.
You know a plant that looks
wonderful indoors outdoors you
know it can be a whole
different ballgame.
100 percent.
Yeah.
All right.
We have some questions real
quick for you Kimmy if you guys
have some last minute questions
please get them in.
What part of Oklahoma are you
located.
You don't have to necessarily be
all Google with it and be creepy
and tell us you know where I
learned that that thing will
tell you like where certain
people's bathrooms are located
like it's on this side of the
house.
So you guys are new have the new
iPhone.
Turn that shit off.
Holy shit.
That's crazy.
We are in northeast Oklahoma in
the Illinois River Valley.
Right.
OK.
What's the biggest closest
biggest city to you.
I guess.
Siloam Springs Arkansas.
We're like almost to the
Arkansas border.
OK.
So you're out in a cut there.
Oh yeah.
I'm glad we're like you know 20
minutes from.
You know town.
OK so you can go on into town
and Tulsa like an hour and a
half away which Tulsa is where
we have to get like a bunch of
stuff.
OK.
So you got to OK.
Let's go a little ride.
It's super pretty.
It's like the foothills of the
Ozark Mountains.
So there's like beautiful rivers
and like tons of trees and we
got some good like wild fungi
going on out here.
And
pretty.
It's really pretty.
Sounds good.
Can you see that question.
Can you not get a rotten stump
with mushrooms.
And shout out to shout out to
Lori.
Long time.
Yes.
I'm not a mushroom expert but I
believe most mushroom people
will recommend starting with a
fresh stump or a fresh log cut
off a tree because with a rotten
stump other fungi has already
had the chance to inoculate it.
So you don't want if you're
trying to inoculate something
you don't want those spores to
have to compete with other
mushrooms.
So to inoculate something you
want a fresh kind of clean log.
So you put all those plugs in or
however you're doing it with
spores and then those will have
a better chance of thriving
because they don't have to
compete.
100 percent.
You're on it.
The only thing is when you cut
them wait two weeks just let
them cut cut the fresh and then
let it two weeks to kind of dry
a little bit and then.
Yeah.
Do you do you do a bunch of
mushrooms though.
I don't know about a bunch of
mushroom stuff but I'll take
logs and put plugs in them.
Yeah.
Grow mushrooms.
You know I don't do too much.
I'm not like doing the indoor
mushroom cultivation.
My whole thing is I love fungi
because it works the soil.
You know I mean it's what I
mean.
You need to come see my pit.
Yeah I do.
I do want to come out there.
I definitely want to make a trip
out to Oklahoma again.
Brian we need to get back out
there.
We had a good you know good
lunch.
We had a good time.
We had a good time.
I told you man I got I got the
truck.
Let's do it.
I can travel wherever.
Road trip.
Yeah I'm excited especially like
Camp Compost.
Some of the things are maybe
later in the summer just when
community is getting together
finding ways to improve on
things and then coming back and
having a year to work on it and
come back.
That used to be something I've
you know with the Indo Expo and
some of that where people want
to fly in and it was always in
January.
It was always January.
It was always January.
It was always in January.
So it kind of like kicked off
the whole year.
All of that has gone to the way
side because unfortunately that
gentleman passed away.
So some of these events are I
think are crucial to kind of
holding the glue of the little
community without all of the
Internet.
I mean we we have people fighting
on our thing today.
I don't realize that happens
Marco but people just always
think they're smarter and better
than others.
It's like man we're not.
No one should be thinking like
that.
No one should be being pompous in
that way because it's silly.
No one has figured out mother
nature.
So for you to speak on that
matter no one has here invented
cannabis.
So to speak on it in that manner
is silly.
Like I'm going to learn open so
wrapped up into this.
Let's just just trying to help
folks.
So this is just trying to do
something that we have done and
that works like most of the
people when you come over here
and they're doing that hating in
the chat.
They really ain't about that
living soil.
I probably really haven't fully
accepted that this way of nature
really works and probably is the
best way to grow your cannabis
in my opinion.
So usually that's the only
reason you're going to have that
negative energy on a show like
this.
You know you think about it.
So whoever was doing that man
that's weird and really just you
know find a different show this
fits your vibe.
You know I mean that's what I'd
be my advice to that with the
arguments and stuff.
I love it.
So that's weird.
That is weird.
It's just weird.
YouTube you can immediately type
in something and you're down
another rabbit hole.
Yeah.
Immediately.
All right.
What's your favorite brand hash
and kind of brand I would
imagine you're going to say this
is like asking a musician like
what is your favorite music.
Me.
I love listening to me.
Oh hash.
I still love like old school
bubble hash like straight bubble
hash.
But there's not much around
these days.
So unless you make it yourself
and that's mostly what I do but
I love I guess as far as
Oklahoma hash makers got beans
greens is putting out some fire
hash with outdoor organic.
And he also has really cool
boxes that have seeds in them.
So when you plant when you smoke
his hash you can plant flower
seeds from his box which is
really cool.
I like that.
Yeah.
So cool.
Another hash guy.
I don't know.
No that's why I like to make
your own all the time.
So if you're young enough you
got the time to learn to grow
while you're literally while
you're learning to grow and then
you got the time to grow as a
with experience washing your
own stuff and maybe taking the
time so that you don't have any
failed runs or missed
conceptions of what some genetics
can provide.
I'm really not picky.
I'm like all good like it's good
in this way and maybe some are
good in the other way.
This is a more of a question for
you Marco about that eight
acorn sprout which we've been
talking about.
I think there's some magic
obviously in any kind of seed
the avocado with the avocado
tech magic in that seed acorn
seed same thing oak trees.
I mean you see it in nature.
So he said I've collected two
bags of acorns.
How many sprout each time and
how often I would imagine do I
feed the soil with that.
OK.
OK.
So yeah you collected those two
bags of acorns like I use acorns
sometimes I'll crush them and
make an IMO pile you know I mean
or you could just crush them let
them sit on the ground to
inoculate and then use them in
your soil like you can either
blend them in your soil or just
use them as a top dress and
then cover them with mulch.
You know I've used acorns as
much as like one or two inches
thick top layer you know crushed
acorns and you know you can
sprout them like seed sprouted
teas.
You know what I mean.
Ian was talking about that
we're talking about the value
of you know sprouted teas barley
and acorns is the same thing
acorns if you look at it it's
just it's like a piece of meat
in there.
So it's a nut you know I mean
so I'll say meat but it's not
in there and that's the food
that's what everything's trying
to eat.
So for me just crush them up put
them in your soil either of
those ways man you'd be good to
go.
So I don't think you can overdo
it.
You know what I mean.
I will say this acorns the
reason I do like to crush them
as well as because acorns will
there's a worm that will get in
the acorn it's a little it turns
into a moth doesn't affect
cannabis.
What happens though is that moth
will pack sometimes and you'll
have it in your grow and then
you got to kick it out or throw
it outside.
So crushing those acorns kind of
keeps them from getting
inoculated by that local moth
that you know wants to you know
boom.
I mean you talk about breaking
it down.
Yeah.
All right.
We got another kind of this is
more of like a fun question.
They want to know about your
guitar in the background.
Let me find it.
Tell us about the guitar and
what you'd like to play.
Oh that is my like I play
banjo mostly like folks are
like clown or banjo is like
what I do is I play like a
banjo and I play like a
folk or like clown or banjo is
like what I do but that guitar
is my my surf pan guitar because
I want a punk like punk surf
band.
So it's got the whammy bar.
I love punk rock shit.
I love it all like I mostly play
banjo like old time or like I
used to be in like a bunch of
like bands back in the day
because like I said before I
grew weed I was like doing
music full time.
So now that that guitar is just
for my dorky surf punk shit
decoration.
It gets played every so little
bit.
But a lot of banjo and trying to
fuck around on fiddle.
You ever play to your plants.
I know you don't have time.
That's what
yeah I like play out on the
porch and stuff you know which
is close to the plant.
That's right.
I knew Chad was gonna come out
when somebody said whammy bar.
I knew it.
Yeah it's for those like sweet
you know fucking surf flicks
gotta have the whammy.
No doubt.
All right again we're respecting
everybody's time with the show.
So that was the last question.
If you kind of want to you know
tell everybody where you're at
where they can reach out to you
some of maybe the dispensaries
where they can find your product
all of that kind of stuff and
then we'll wrap it up with you
Marco.
Head on till next week.
All right.
Yeah like I said they said I'm
Jackalope Farms.
I am mostly accessible via
Instagram which my at is
what I'm labeled at here.
It's Jackalope Farms dot
cannabis and you usually have to
search that entire name to find
me because the shadow bands
and those are real people.
I first think they're not real.
Those are 100 percent real and
we've always said just add a zero
to whatever cannabis.
So if Marco's at twenty five
thousand then in reality he'd
probably be at two hundred and
fifty thousand if there wasn't
all these limits on Instagram
shit.
So just kind of remember
hashtagging it.
So someone said don't hashtag
and you'll eliminate the bands.
Instagram is way too creepy.
You can find where they what
videos like have you restricted
in your settings.
Yeah I can show you guys if you
want.
And once once they have that
algorithm has eyes on you though
it's kind of like yeah.
Yeah it's an uphill battle for
sure.
It's bullshit.
But that's where I'm at and you
can usually reach me there.
And I'm in Oklahoma and I will
be at the crawfish boil
at Beans Greens Farm on April
29th which is a fun event which
you can find all that
information on my Instagram.
And thanks so much for having
me.
I hope you know you learn some
things and I hope to talk to
you all more.
Yeah I did.
I love this was a great talk.
This was much better than the
first time we met.
Right.
This is this is what we need to
talk about the soil growing
business.
Wow.
You're you're amazing.
You know your stuff like I
mean for anybody right.
It's not even like we're past
the point of like she knows her
stuff for a lady or you know
no for anybody as a grower you
know your shit and I can see
that I'm like damn.
I'm just trying to learn.
Oh yeah.
But you know and that's that's
cool.
Be humble.
Let me give you I'll give you
your little flowers now.
No I can't.
We appreciate you and I
definitely took a few notes and
yeah thanks a lot.
Give me my success to you and
we look forward to seeing you
again.
You know hopefully we'll have
you on again because this was a
great show.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Come on out.
Yes I'm gonna make it out there.
We'll get out of the river to
float on.
It's fun.
Oh I like River Float.
Yeah this is an excellent show
you know we like Marco had said
we kind of met you under all
these weird circumstances but
this is how we try to keep it
each and every week is this
there's positivity we're trying
to highlight people that are
out there actually in the
trenches doing it and then
trying to bring out the best in
you know picking your brain and
I hope that more people realize
that if they're following a lot
of the stuff that the people in
the actual trenches are doing
listening to you today about how
hard it is to actually get a lot
of things it gets harder as each
year goes by.
So you know I think if you're in
whatever state you're in and
you're debating about it you
kind of have to remember that
things change pretty
dramatically sometimes you know
fees and ways to get things and
you know all of a sudden all
these specific lawyers raise
their prices there's a lot of
kind of finances you're not
ready for.
Yeah.
So find in your own way is
obviously kind of that motto for
us for 2023 but also remember
you know where you're at and
what your lane is and if that
sounds so stressing to you and
you only have a hundred thousand
dollars to your name then I
would put that in a house and
get a tent grow and then
continue on that journey and
just put that those commercial
dreams down the road but that
doesn't mean that you can't
achieve them and I hope that
this show kind of gives that off
today.
London if you're there sir
always you know just appreciate
on the back end stuff and in a
way Marco teaching us probably
what 2023 stuff should be.
We just always felt like the
content was all that mattered
trying to bring out the best and
now we have a little of the
extra bells and whistles.
I mean I'm kind of proud of that
Marco you know London's really
kind of changing things on the
back end so appreciate you sir.
While we're doing it you know
we don't want to look all right
we want to look decent you know
decent show I think we're doing
fine man I appreciate everybody
is here again listening be about
it farms you always in the house
screaming demon always hillbilly
herb rusty nails appreciate all
y'all guys with the positivity
you know I mean that's what it's
all about here.
If you want to kick it with us
you know two three hours might
as well leave on a positive note
who wants to leave you know
pissed off.
So not all I got to say.
Yeah we again appreciate
everything if you want to go
check her out again it's
Jackalope Jackalope farms
cannabis and I believe you have
a period in between those so it
is pretty hard to find her
Instagram you have to type it
in and out fully and just kind
of again solidifies what she's
saying she's shadow banned so
that's just kind of is what it
is so please support her in
other ways where you can like
this you know even comments go
a long way when you comment at
the bottom of this sharing
liking all the things that here
every time you watch a YouTube
channel the reason why they say
that is because it does matter
so if you like this kind of
programming all you have to do
is hit that like button that's
all we're asking and we'll
continue to provide it for you
any last words or anything
Marco as we're getting into
this now man y'all have a good
one much love peace
