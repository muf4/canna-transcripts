[00:00.000 --> 00:04.940]  Birds happy Wednesday to you. I got up early this morning for this show
[00:04.940 --> 00:11.820]  So this is something obviously that's special to me is that we're kind of diving deeper into a variety of different topics today
[00:12.900 --> 00:15.360]  Last week, unfortunately, we got put in timeout
[00:15.860 --> 00:19.820]  So it was kind of newer news to us kind of last minute as well
[00:19.820 --> 00:24.420]  So we apologize for that from what I understand the whole you know
[00:24.420 --> 00:31.400]  FCP one was in a timeout for a week just the same way it happens on Instagram. I guess that happens on YouTube
[00:31.400 --> 00:38.200]  I didn't even know you could be suspended for that long. So kind of moving forward with that kind of stuff, you know, we've
[00:38.720 --> 00:43.260]  we've reached out to all of the people that helped with Heather and her
[00:44.700 --> 00:47.680]  You know hurt her seed fundraiser and that kind of stuff
[00:48.180 --> 00:53.640]  So if you didn't receive your seeds in America, you should have so please reach out to me
[00:53.640 --> 00:57.940]  There were three people in Canada that the seeds went out today to Peter
[00:58.420 --> 01:05.260]  And then Peter's gonna send those out because he knows how to do that the proper way. So all of that back housekeeping
[01:05.780 --> 01:10.700]  Can that kind of threw me off there man? I was in my zone. So you want to promote your your tour?
[01:11.400 --> 01:18.120]  No, actually, no, I was switching brands in the background and DP had a bunch of stuff on my brand page
[01:18.140 --> 01:20.340]  It wasn't supposed to come up brother. I'm sorry
[01:20.840 --> 01:26.820]  Okay, yeah, all right, so obviously Kent Kent's doing stuff behind the scenes there's a lot of different shows
[01:26.820 --> 01:32.780]  So, you know, there's a lot of stuff going on with FCP and hopefully we don't violate any things again
[01:32.780 --> 01:38.520]  And you know, we don't get put timeout. So I want to give it out to my co-host. Mr. Marco
[01:39.080 --> 01:44.440]  You know, this is again one of my shows that one of the shows that I feel like buddy, you know coming out here
[01:44.440 --> 01:46.440]  Driving out here seeing the countryside
[01:46.940 --> 01:51.740]  There's just something special to this place and so I'm excited to kind of hopefully
[01:52.660 --> 01:57.980]  Share with our audience what really goes on and some of these soil soil places in Colorado
[01:58.540 --> 02:00.740]  Yeah, yeah, I'm excited about this one, too
[02:01.500 --> 02:03.980]  Bart hey on you good good to see you man
[02:04.740 --> 02:10.540]  For everybody doesn't know Bart. I've known him for over a year now. We were all out in, Oklahoma
[02:11.300 --> 02:12.660]  doing a
[02:12.660 --> 02:14.660]  the hustle and learn
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.880]  Hustle and educate hustle and that's right and so we were out there hustling and educating so
[02:21.480 --> 02:24.680]  Much respect for Bart someone who knows this stuff knows the soil
[02:26.840 --> 02:29.920]  Yeah, definitely it's gonna be a real treat guys as far as
[02:30.680 --> 02:33.380]  Digging in learning kind of what the larger scale
[02:34.220 --> 02:39.580]  Operations do what you know what it takes to kind of get to that size and that scale and keep that quality
[02:39.640 --> 02:44.000]  It's kind of a big thing. So you guys know how we do we just get into it
[02:44.020 --> 02:49.460]  So with that said once you jump in give us a little intro for the people that don't know you and well
[02:49.460 --> 02:53.700]  I wanted to highlight I wanted to highlight some of the things that he's been working on just this year Marco
[02:54.260 --> 02:55.300]  so
[02:55.300 --> 02:56.660]  You know
[02:56.660 --> 03:00.260]  Obviously people have been using his soil from a cannabis aspect
[03:00.260 --> 03:04.340]  But there's large institutions that are using his soil right here in Colorado
[03:04.520 --> 03:11.060]  Some really big names if you're from Colorado or maybe a visited Colorado so like the Denver Botanical Gardens
[03:11.120 --> 03:18.200]  You know, they're picking Bart's brain on ways to improve their their aspects the US Department of Ag the Cherry Creek Mall
[03:18.200 --> 03:23.440]  So, you know, I go there with my my kids probably two or three times a month
[03:23.760 --> 03:26.480]  So you guys know how beautiful the Cherry Creek Mall is?
[03:26.800 --> 03:30.440]  the city of Grand Junction and then the Aspen Art Museum
[03:30.440 --> 03:35.020]  Which I I kind of wanted to start off with that one because from what I understand that was more of a kind of like
[03:35.020 --> 03:37.320]  A fun project too. It was really cool
[03:38.040 --> 03:43.420]  You know, we're we're in Western Colorado we're kind of halfway between Aspen and Telluride and
[03:45.840 --> 03:48.700]  There was an artist over there that wanted to do a living
[03:49.340 --> 03:53.820]  Living art installation on the roof of the Aspen Art Museum and they knew about us
[03:53.820 --> 03:56.660]  we do a lot of work in the Aspen area and
[03:59.340 --> 04:01.540]  Yeah, it was just really cool to see what could happen
[04:02.480 --> 04:09.000]  When somebody takes takes their artistic effort and I think that's on our Instagram some pictures of that installation
[04:09.240 --> 04:11.240]  but takes the effort and
[04:11.960 --> 04:13.960]  doesn't just want to
[04:14.760 --> 04:21.560]  Make it pretty using chem nudes. They were dedicated to having this be organic because of the kind of
[04:23.480 --> 04:28.320]  Ethic behind the installation and how it was trying to educate people and
[04:28.780 --> 04:36.300]  How there are different ways to do things and yeah, we we really enjoyed being part of that project and the the Denver Botanical Gardens
[04:36.660 --> 04:38.220]  For those have never seen that
[04:38.220 --> 04:44.000]  I mean that is almost like a must must visit type thing on all the the visiting website
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  Colorado visiting websites and that kind of thing
[04:46.060 --> 04:49.980]  So I find it remarkable that I got the man right here where you know
[04:49.980 --> 04:53.900]  They're picking his brain on how to improve things from what I understand things have been
[04:54.520 --> 05:01.520]  Declining at the Botanical Gardens, which is obviously a no-no when everybody's coming to see the big beautiful colors
[05:01.720 --> 05:05.320]  on a variety of different plants usually in a very small space, so
[05:05.780 --> 05:11.000]  Let's kind of dive deeper into that as well Bart and how you're able to manage that and educate that to their team
[05:11.060 --> 05:13.500]  so that they can kind of like pass that on because
[05:14.120 --> 05:18.560]  The information is almost like telephone sometimes where you know, you pass it on to the head grower
[05:18.560 --> 05:20.960]  He passes it on and it seems like sometimes it's missed
[05:21.140 --> 05:24.340]  How are you able to really take that to the next level with those guys
[05:24.340 --> 05:30.380]  Yeah, and so we're working at the Chatfield Farms location of the Botanic Gardens. They've got several locations
[05:30.700 --> 05:36.300]  There's the obviously the York Street downtown Denver, but Chatfield Farms is a
[05:37.540 --> 05:39.780]  Pretty big farm that they run out
[05:40.780 --> 05:42.780]  out kind of
[05:43.460 --> 05:45.460]  Basically west of Denver there
[05:46.300 --> 05:49.980]  and kind of in the southwest area and
[05:50.960 --> 05:54.140]  it's a really historic ranch and
[05:54.940 --> 05:59.560]  They put out hundreds of CSAs a day in the summer for low-income
[06:00.580 --> 06:04.380]  families, so like vegetable food shares things like that and
[06:05.460 --> 06:10.060]  and so, you know, we took a look at some of their soils tests there and
[06:10.660 --> 06:13.980]  we're able to pretty quickly identify some problems and
[06:14.040 --> 06:16.040]  And
[06:16.040 --> 06:22.760]  This is I guess a good a good way to segue into some of the stuff I see with these soils tests
[06:23.120 --> 06:24.280]  but
[06:24.280 --> 06:27.400]  you know, there's kind of two worlds I feel like there's the
[06:28.080 --> 06:30.840]  chemnewt people who are running salts and
[06:31.600 --> 06:34.360]  When they're doing that on any sort of a scale outside
[06:34.360 --> 06:38.960]  I mean, it's one thing when you're in your in your 10 by 10 and you've you know
[06:38.960 --> 06:43.320]  You've got all the cocoa organic matter you want but outdoors
[06:44.880 --> 06:48.400]  Really running salts, especially nitrate salts
[06:48.400 --> 06:55.280]  I have found to just burn the organic matter out of soil and leave you with like a 1% organic matter clay or
[06:55.600 --> 06:57.600]  less sometimes
[06:57.640 --> 07:04.440]  and that that activity really I feel like is driven by the bacterial microorganisms and
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.480]  So, you know, we know when we're making compost or something
[07:08.480 --> 07:13.780]  You need like a 21 or 30 to 1 carbon to nitrogen ratio
[07:15.100 --> 07:17.100]  because those
[07:17.380 --> 07:21.700]  thermophiles those composting microbes want to consume
[07:23.220 --> 07:29.780]  Any of the nitrogen and use carbon to process it and vice versa if there's extra nitrogen will use carbon to process it and
[07:30.340 --> 07:35.060]  So when you have excess nitrates in your soil in the fall in the winter
[07:35.200 --> 07:38.640]  Which if you run salts, you're gonna have excess nitrate in the soil
[07:39.200 --> 07:40.560]  then
[07:40.560 --> 07:43.820]  Then all those bacterial organisms are in your soil
[07:44.400 --> 07:48.040]  chewing up carbon literally burning the carbon out of your soil and
[07:48.440 --> 07:55.600]  Leaving you with a with a heavy clay and that's why all these sports fields you end up seeing them just super hard clay
[07:55.600 --> 07:59.280]  All the hay farmers out here super hard clay
[08:00.320 --> 08:04.760]  And then then you've got the flip side and this is what we ran into at the Botanic Gardens
[08:04.860 --> 08:07.060]  there's all these organic farms and
[08:07.940 --> 08:11.200]  They're treating their soil well, and they've got higher organic matter
[08:11.700 --> 08:16.700]  But what what I see at so many organic farms is potassium
[08:17.460 --> 08:18.780]  toxicity
[08:18.780 --> 08:21.820]  that comes from over compost application and
[08:22.460 --> 08:25.060]  So I feel like that's one of the things we could really
[08:26.060 --> 08:31.740]  Lend to Chatfield farms is saying hey guys, you've done a great job with this compost
[08:32.120 --> 08:36.720]  But but you've gone too far and now you're potassium toxic
[08:36.720 --> 08:39.640]  they're in the thousands of parts per million of
[08:40.400 --> 08:46.760]  Potassium and that's just that's just gonna end up with a bunch of plant health problems. So
[08:48.120 --> 08:52.560]  Yep, that that's a lot of what we did there and then we
[08:53.280 --> 08:57.040]  Really went through all their trace mineral holes. They had some
[08:57.820 --> 09:05.660]  Deficiencies in zinc and manganese we tuned their calcium and magnesium a little bit and then gave them a whole bunch of amino based
[09:05.860 --> 09:07.500]  nitrogen and
[09:07.500 --> 09:12.860]  And as well as pH adjustment in Denver right now anyone that's on Denver City water
[09:13.220 --> 09:16.260]  Which they are the Denver City water is running
[09:17.440 --> 09:19.440]  pH 9
[09:19.460 --> 09:22.980]  And they're doing that for lead lead pipe
[09:23.740 --> 09:25.740]  health mitigation issues
[09:25.960 --> 09:27.280]  But
[09:27.280 --> 09:33.960]  Denver is just gonna get browner and browner and browner over the next few years as that alkalinity rises and
[09:34.480 --> 09:38.900]  So I really feel like it's critical for people in Denver in particular
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.960]  To be adding citric acid or some sort of acid to their water supply
[09:44.960 --> 09:50.120]  And potentially their irrigation water. So with those components we were able to get
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  Chatfields farms yields up
[09:53.280 --> 09:55.280]  significantly healthier plants
[09:55.280 --> 09:57.760]  higher yields in the first year that we
[09:58.300 --> 10:04.620]  Started doing this farm scale custom nutrient blend for them and we do that for a lot of our customers
[10:04.620 --> 10:12.060]  A lot of people don't necessarily know that we do that. But at this point, yeah, we we we provide custom nutrients for
[10:13.060 --> 10:15.060]  municipalities all the way to
[10:15.780 --> 10:17.500]  To some very large farms
[10:17.500 --> 10:24.340]  So you guys will take it from kind of testing and then adding in the nutrients that are necessary the whole remediation
[10:24.800 --> 10:26.160]  process
[10:26.160 --> 10:33.080]  Exactly. Yeah, so yeah, and that's that's kind of maybe where I differ from an Elaine Ingham type person or something
[10:33.080 --> 10:35.980]  I mean, I agree with all her work on biology
[10:35.980 --> 10:40.960]  And I think if you've got all the time in the world the microbes can build that fertility
[10:41.280 --> 10:45.360]  But in the real world you have to make stuff happen this year
[10:45.360 --> 10:50.320]  And so that's the first thing I do when I come in is try to get the mineralization set, right?
[10:50.320 --> 10:52.320]  And then I'll work on the biology
[10:52.740 --> 10:58.600]  Do you so in that first scenario where you said the clay, you know kind of the carbon had been chewed out of the soil
[10:59.220 --> 11:01.780]  Now you're left with kind of that sticky clay ish
[11:03.300 --> 11:04.580]  Consistency
[11:04.580 --> 11:10.900]  What do you do on like only on the physical side as far as I understand you're doing that, you know chemical remediation
[11:10.900 --> 11:14.900]  But are you doing physical, you know adding in you know different maybe
[11:15.460 --> 11:17.920]  Aggregates or substrates to the soil as well
[11:18.820 --> 11:21.860]  Definitely and it really comes down to people's budgets
[11:21.860 --> 11:27.140]  I mean if you've got a field that's missing organic matter and they've got the money to throw core
[11:28.020 --> 11:31.740]  Pete or something at it then great. That's a superior product
[11:32.200 --> 11:36.480]  But most people aren't gonna have that kind of budget and we're working with
[11:37.240 --> 11:40.620]  Some really tight budgets and trying to basically do magic
[11:40.660 --> 11:45.280]  So a lot of time these days for the organic matter side of things I'm using sawdust
[11:45.940 --> 11:51.860]  Okay, and it's it's kind of crazy and everyone will be like Oh nitrogen lockout. That's the first big thing
[11:52.100 --> 11:56.660]  So obviously you can't be using sawdust without a nitrogen source
[11:57.340 --> 12:03.080]  Additional supplemental nitrogen source and once again, I'm really into amino based nitrogens
[12:03.820 --> 12:06.580]  Been using them for almost 30 years
[12:06.580 --> 12:13.260]  I don't like the salts and and some of the big negatives I find with salts and I've seen the research show
[12:13.680 --> 12:16.340]  You know you get this cell stretching effect
[12:16.480 --> 12:19.360]  Do you get a bigger plant maybe out of that? Sure
[12:19.560 --> 12:26.820]  But at the cell wall is thinner and weaker and so the pests and pathogens are gonna have an easier time attacking it
[12:27.780 --> 12:29.780]  also, you have a
[12:30.280 --> 12:38.440]  Boron stripping effect and so, you know, I feel like the the research I've seen shows that boron is one of the most critical
[12:39.400 --> 12:45.360]  Elements for plant immune health and so in this way you can see there's a double gut punch from
[12:46.460 --> 12:52.640]  The boron stripping with immune health and the cell wall stretching all caused by nitrates
[12:52.860 --> 12:57.720]  Let alone the fact that it then kills all your fungal organisms or a lot of them
[12:58.780 --> 13:05.140]  You know and then you're left without organic matter and the organic matter is the water holding capability of your soil
[13:05.140 --> 13:10.060]  And so, you know if you're if you're down at 1% organic matter
[13:10.060 --> 13:15.000]  And I can use some sawdust to get someone up to 2% organic matter
[13:15.220 --> 13:19.840]  there's a 300% increase in the water holding capability of the soil and
[13:20.180 --> 13:26.000]  In a time when we've got the environmental conditions we have when the planets going where it is
[13:26.500 --> 13:30.660]  To me I just it just seems insane to me to be dumping more nitrates in
[13:30.860 --> 13:37.260]  Which then washes off in the red tides and we burn organic matter out of our soil and it's just another way
[13:37.260 --> 13:39.060]  We're going in the wrong direction
[13:39.060 --> 13:40.500]  Instead of the right direction
[13:40.500 --> 13:48.340]  So I love that the organic farms all they've they've all got like 6% organic matter and that's what I consider optimal
[13:48.740 --> 13:51.820]  but they get there with the compost and
[13:52.980 --> 13:54.980]  You know
[13:54.980 --> 14:01.860]  I've got a theory. This is an interesting question for you guys and we'll see if your theory matches my theory, but
[14:02.740 --> 14:10.300]  I was wondered like why would compost be out of ratio? I really believe in all breaks ratios of minerals and
[14:11.300 --> 14:13.020]  and and
[14:13.020 --> 14:17.860]  most composts are kind of like a one two three and my and my
[14:19.140 --> 14:22.740]  Experience, you know, and of course your feedstocks will bury that a little
[14:23.100 --> 14:26.720]  But really across the vegan compost the chicken compost
[14:26.720 --> 14:33.780]  I tend to find that ratio holds true of a really high potassium in compost and not enough nitrogen and
[14:34.700 --> 14:37.820]  And wondered if you guys have ever thought about that or anything. I
[14:38.740 --> 14:40.740]  mean I have I
[14:42.060 --> 14:46.360]  Think because the nitrogen that's in compost is so
[14:47.360 --> 14:55.240]  Easily I think it's easily consumed it's readily available to all the microbiology and I think it probably gets
[14:56.160 --> 14:58.160]  converted to a different
[14:58.560 --> 15:01.440]  Substance quicker or a different kind of compound if you will
[15:03.360 --> 15:05.360]  You know, I think that um
[15:07.080 --> 15:09.000]  You know, I said it is a great question
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.360]  I kind of thought about it and you know now that we're thinking about it kind of leads to more questions. So
[15:14.360 --> 15:19.400]  You know, I make a lot of I use a lot of Bokashi in my compost for example
[15:19.400 --> 15:26.000]  All right, so I'll turn wood chips in the soil by using a lot of food scraps Bokashi food scraps now
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  Bokashi is usually high in salt
[15:29.240 --> 15:32.320]  Because um because of the food scraps you have to watch that
[15:32.960 --> 15:34.480]  but um
[15:34.480 --> 15:39.920]  Bokashi is really good at turning wood, you know chips into soil and if they do it really fast
[15:39.920 --> 15:45.880]  And I think it's because you know, the Bokashi is pre pre composted obviously
[15:46.520 --> 15:50.140]  But I think that you know, the microbiology really gets in there faster
[15:50.140 --> 15:50.640]  So, I don't know
[15:50.640 --> 15:57.600]  I feel like in compost in general things that are easier to consume and easier for the microbes to you know to eat
[15:57.640 --> 15:59.520]  You know that mean
[15:59.520 --> 16:05.240]  Are going to go out of balance quicker. That makes sense. I don't know for sure
[16:06.240 --> 16:13.440]  Well, I I think to like that ratio one two three, I mean that's more in my opinion that's that's for the flower
[16:13.600 --> 16:18.600]  So the plant is gonna be weak as you're putting that on you need some kind of like fungal aspects
[16:18.680 --> 16:23.920]  You know that the ratio back in the day for to keep it really simple when we first started was three two one two
[16:23.920 --> 16:26.560]  One two three, you know, you're keeping your nitrogen higher
[16:27.320 --> 16:33.320]  Potassium and phosphorus lower and then obviously that switches. So if that's all that's being fed, I think
[16:34.080 --> 16:38.480]  Potentially also, you know, if you're going heavy with you've mentioned this before Bart with like the biochar
[16:38.560 --> 16:45.120]  So now you have kind of not enough then you have the biochar there the alpha stulture emerge the D
[16:45.120 --> 16:50.800]  Bose as we like to call them Marco, they're out there taking everybody's chain. And so as time progresses
[16:50.800 --> 16:56.840]  It's not the diversity that we once thought we might have had and and then when we're not feeding it properly
[16:56.840 --> 16:58.840]  I just don't think it has the strength
[16:58.880 --> 17:02.280]  Also when you're a beginner farmer, you know, you don't have the calcium there either
[17:02.360 --> 17:08.160]  So the plants probably really struggling to just really, you know start to build that process
[17:08.440 --> 17:14.680]  So you got to focus on that blueprint and I think ratios do matter at least you need to start to understand those ratios. I
[17:15.560 --> 17:18.000]  Know we say trust the process and that kind of thing
[17:18.000 --> 17:18.320]  But yeah
[17:18.320 --> 17:23.720]  If your compost is out of whack or you're using a compost that might have too much like guanos or something that you maybe
[17:24.040 --> 17:29.280]  You know, maybe you don't add the blood meals and the guanos and the first time when you're doing compost, you know
[17:29.280 --> 17:34.520]  You try to keep it super simple. That's where I see a lot of people also mess up Bart when they watch dr
[17:34.520 --> 17:40.060]  Laney and videos they start to do their own composting. They think they need to add 62 amendments
[17:40.280 --> 17:45.680]  And then of course things go anaerobic or things are too hot. So too many mistakes
[17:45.680 --> 17:49.480]  I think can be made when you're first starting to learn the the composting process
[17:49.480 --> 17:54.560]  That's why I'm a huge advocate of always talking about vermicomposting laying the worms do it for you
[17:55.240 --> 17:57.240]  Awesome. Yeah
[18:01.360 --> 18:03.360]  Well, it's all
[18:04.000 --> 18:10.080]  It's all part of that process and it's all how we get here and the wacky thing that came to me and I don't know
[18:10.080 --> 18:14.480]  Any way to prove this a few years ago is that I realized okay a lot of these
[18:15.320 --> 18:18.240]  Compost or manure base and in any ecosystem
[18:18.600 --> 18:24.920]  You're gonna have the animals and that's what is I feel like is a little bit missing in a lot of this stuff
[18:25.320 --> 18:29.300]  the animals that made the manure in a in a primitive farm
[18:29.300 --> 18:36.280]  you would have the bones and you would have the the skin and the hide and that's all pure amino nitrogen and
[18:36.640 --> 18:43.080]  Once I like kind of started taking the meat component back into it all and I'm sure the vegans are gonna lose it on me
[18:43.080 --> 18:45.080]  here today, but I
[18:45.400 --> 18:53.600]  Like I really feel like the meat is what's missing like in the forest when animals die their bodies fall down and that's all
[18:53.600 --> 19:01.200]  pure high quality like the the bone meal you mentioned or or the feather meal or the fish bone meal that I like to use
[19:01.920 --> 19:03.200]  these
[19:03.200 --> 19:07.120]  These high nitrogen meat components. I feel like are really
[19:07.800 --> 19:15.040]  What kept compost in ratio in nature and that's what we're missing a lot when we bring in a truckload of feedstocks
[19:15.400 --> 19:19.640]  Mix up this big batch of compost. We're missing all the carcasses
[19:21.840 --> 19:26.200]  Yeah, I think that's important too man just I mean it's simple as FAA, you know
[19:26.200 --> 19:28.880]  I mean the power of those amino acids, you know what I mean?
[19:30.200 --> 19:35.960]  It's very beneficial. But yeah, I definitely think that um, you do get value to
[19:36.520 --> 19:41.560]  To the animals in your compost, you know, I mean like you said nothing could be vegan
[19:41.560 --> 19:45.520]  I was talking that telling my wife the other day and we're walking through the woods, you know
[19:45.520 --> 19:51.720]  I was like you can't have vegan out here because there's stuff dying a deer could have died over there two months ago
[19:51.720 --> 19:58.720]  And now it's decomposed. Well, the soil has all that, you know meat in it, you know, if you will so, you know it to me
[19:59.160 --> 20:01.160]  certain things
[20:01.440 --> 20:05.640]  Cannot be achieved because they're not that way in nature, you know what I mean? So
[20:06.720 --> 20:09.880]  You know, it doesn't really answer the question on the ratio, but you know
[20:11.880 --> 20:18.480]  I like it and it's true and it's how it is. And so that's what I like looking back at all the time is
[20:19.120 --> 20:23.720]  What's nature doing? And I know you guys do too. I see that in all your shows. I
[20:25.400 --> 20:27.400]  Really appreciate that and
[20:27.680 --> 20:33.040]  Yeah, just a wacky a wacky thought I've had that I'll probably never be able to prove but yeah
[20:34.480 --> 20:35.560]  I
[20:35.560 --> 20:39.560]  Think there's something special to with the with the blood like if you're really talking, you know
[20:39.560 --> 20:45.080]  You're ranching on your own farm. Things are dying things are changing. There's something to the blood aspect to it
[20:45.080 --> 20:50.000]  it seems like the the soil life loves when those kind of things happens, there's a like almost a
[20:51.200 --> 20:57.120]  Renaissance of that that little area when things have passed on so I think that we as
[20:57.600 --> 21:00.400]  Especially a lot of us that are trying this as an indoor farmer
[21:00.400 --> 21:06.280]  We need to kind of remember those things that actually what happens in nature and you're driving here this morning Bart. I mean
[21:06.880 --> 21:08.880]  It's comical to think that
[21:09.800 --> 21:11.800]  How else could mother nature do that?
[21:11.800 --> 21:18.240]  Unless there was some kind of microbial life the leaves are literally falling as I'm driving feeding for next year
[21:18.240 --> 21:20.680]  It always seems like mother nature's, you know
[21:21.680 --> 21:26.520]  Years ahead and in her thinking, you know, it just seems like the trees grow in a way
[21:26.520 --> 21:30.400]  They're always matching if if it's undisturbed and living out here, man. It's
[21:31.280 --> 21:35.440]  about as undisturbed as it could get and you can see that the the overall health of the
[21:36.760 --> 21:39.180]  Drastically different than the trees that you would see in Denver
[21:40.200 --> 21:42.520]  That's it. Yeah, there's an amazing
[21:44.360 --> 21:45.640]  Magical
[21:45.640 --> 21:49.000]  Intelligence I feel in nature and it's why I've wanted to
[21:49.440 --> 21:53.080]  to run my business the way I do because I just always have felt I
[21:53.560 --> 21:55.560]  I'll never really figure it out
[21:55.840 --> 22:01.320]  but if I'm a good steward and I listen well enough nature can teach me and
[22:01.840 --> 22:06.400]  I can kind of ride on the coattails if you will of all this magic and
[22:06.760 --> 22:13.800]  So yeah, just like making the the Bokashi or the compost we make it's always I don't know how you feel
[22:13.800 --> 22:19.720]  But every time I'm like it did it again. There's two million pounds of something that just got made by
[22:20.800 --> 22:27.420]  Trillions of billions a little worker robots that nature gave me for free that I can't even see without a microscope
[22:27.420 --> 22:33.040]  So they're working all day every day every day working so hard. Yeah
[22:33.040 --> 22:38.480]  One thing I like to tell people about compost is you know, time is your best friend
[22:38.480 --> 22:38.960]  You know what?
[22:38.960 --> 22:43.720]  I mean, like if you start a pile and it isn't even if it's out of balance or if it's not right
[22:43.880 --> 22:48.340]  It's just time. You know, I mean if you let it sit there a year even two
[22:48.860 --> 22:53.200]  It gets better and it balances itself out now. I don't know that if you go test that
[22:53.640 --> 22:55.760]  NPK is gonna be a balanced thing
[22:55.760 --> 23:00.460]  I'm not sure how that works out because I don't do a lot of testing but you you might know a little bit more
[23:00.460 --> 23:02.680]  about that, but I feel like that's where the
[23:03.600 --> 23:08.720]  Microbiology from the earth and all the surrounding IMO that's when it colonizes that
[23:09.520 --> 23:12.920]  compost and it just gets really, you know gets really good and I feel like
[23:13.480 --> 23:20.280]  It's important to collect the IMO through every season and it's important to let your compost work and sit through every season
[23:20.280 --> 23:25.040]  You know what? I mean? I know that time is money and I get it every pound of compost is a dollar
[23:25.640 --> 23:31.920]  But what are your thoughts on like the value of kind of really letting that compost age or is it or is that not necessary?
[23:32.160 --> 23:39.240]  You have a specific kind of formula you hit it and now you're you're kind of feel like you're good. I think it's critical
[23:39.240 --> 23:40.960]  I think it's what
[23:40.960 --> 23:44.960]  separates a good composter from a turn and burn composter and
[23:45.400 --> 23:47.560]  there are definitely some other elements but
[23:48.000 --> 23:54.920]  the curing phase I I put as much if not more time into the curing of my compost than I do of the
[23:55.080 --> 23:56.880]  thermophilic phase and
[23:56.880 --> 24:01.360]  I think that pays huge dividends if you were to go to a big front-range
[24:02.360 --> 24:09.680]  Windrow composter like a one or something, you know, they'd think I was crazy. I spend a minimum usually of a year
[24:10.800 --> 24:12.800]  total on a batch of compost and
[24:13.440 --> 24:18.840]  And more than six months of that is is just curing and so, you know
[24:18.840 --> 24:22.200]  We'll we'll bring back in the biology from our cultured
[24:23.000 --> 24:24.080]  piles
[24:24.080 --> 24:28.520]  but as well the nature is a huge part of it and we have
[24:28.840 --> 24:33.760]  It's kind of why we maintain this it's almost like a permaculture food forest type
[24:34.640 --> 24:41.040]  Situation around our compost areas, you know, there's relatively undisturbed leaf litter in there
[24:41.960 --> 24:46.600]  And there are tons of wild animals. We have bears elk deer
[24:48.200 --> 24:53.240]  Fungal organisms I harvest oyster mushrooms out of out of those woods
[24:53.240 --> 24:59.400]  And so by leaving like an undisturbed wooded area, which not everyone can do admittedly
[24:59.400 --> 25:04.880]  but I have the luxury of that we have 36 acres that are our marsh facility and and
[25:05.400 --> 25:10.480]  so we leave a big ring of that undisturbed basically just to be a
[25:11.120 --> 25:14.280]  Natural inoculation zone and then yeah you
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.440]  Like when the compost is running 150 degrees
[25:19.160 --> 25:23.160]  That thermophilic phase that's only seven to eleven organisms at the most
[25:23.160 --> 25:28.160]  There's only eleven species of organisms that can do that hot phase
[25:28.160 --> 25:35.560]  and so that's not species diversity and that's really what we aim for like if if my compost has less than
[25:35.920 --> 25:37.920]  20,000 species in it. I
[25:38.360 --> 25:44.440]  I'm gonna stop and go figure out what I'm doing wrong, but often that's P right there. That's it
[25:44.960 --> 25:46.960]  So that's right that shit down
[25:47.240 --> 25:52.720]  Yeah, so, all right, so how does that so their aging process now, all right, we went thermophilic
[25:52.720 --> 25:54.880]  We know we're down to around seven. Boom
[25:55.480 --> 25:56.760]  Now, how are you?
[25:56.760 --> 26:01.280]  What are you doing to build that up during that time period and you don't have to be too specific
[26:01.400 --> 26:08.380]  But take it as deep as you want to take it for the folks. Yeah, so so which part just like after okay
[26:08.380 --> 26:12.640]  I went thermophilic now you're hot now. Now it's time to go ahead and age that pile
[26:12.720 --> 26:17.960]  So, how does that aging process work and how do we go from that seven species that you know
[26:17.960 --> 26:21.840]  We're down to after thermo to getting back up to 20,000
[26:22.200 --> 26:29.200]  Yeah, exactly. So really mainly that the two factors are one the re-inoculation. So we use some spent
[26:30.280 --> 26:36.000]  Finished product compost and we keep plenty of it aside and we do a few things with that
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.520]  We like case and piles with with it and that helps re-inoculate
[26:39.920 --> 26:45.520]  But really we we like to have a nice pile that we treat really well keep
[26:47.120 --> 26:51.560]  Perfectly moist and really just it's kind of like a sourdough starter almost
[26:51.960 --> 26:58.040]  And so a lot of that diversity comes out of there then to by having those woods all around
[26:58.920 --> 27:05.440]  Those microbes just come on their own and and sometimes I'll go collect a little leaf litter out of the woods and stuff like that
[27:06.200 --> 27:10.920]  And of course if I go up to the to the forest and in our region
[27:10.920 --> 27:14.880]  I'll always bring home a baggie or two of that material and
[27:15.520 --> 27:20.000]  You know, I don't need much and if those microbes want to be here
[27:20.120 --> 27:23.320]  they'll make it if if they don't they won't and
[27:24.040 --> 27:31.480]  and so, you know, but I would say those are two main methods of getting that cure started and and really
[27:32.040 --> 27:36.480]  Accelerating like how much bang for the buck we get out of those six months
[27:37.560 --> 27:42.600]  Because that's the thing in a production operation if you run out of compost
[27:43.280 --> 27:46.080]  You can't just go get some more somewhere or something like that
[27:46.480 --> 27:51.280]  Especially when when we've spent so many years perfecting our method
[27:52.160 --> 27:57.640]  so you just have to plan ahead and you have to you know, you have to put a
[27:58.080 --> 28:00.920]  lot of money, you know, it's it's a
[28:01.480 --> 28:03.320]  80 sometimes
[28:03.320 --> 28:10.040]  $80,000 in chicken litter and you know, it's 60 semi belt trailers and then you've got you know a dozen
[28:11.320 --> 28:15.320]  carbon trucks that are 120 yard walking floor trailers and
[28:15.640 --> 28:19.480]  and you put this whole investment in and then your guys working it and
[28:20.040 --> 28:26.140]  Mixing it and we should see some of that here. This might be a good time to actually check out the video
[28:26.140 --> 28:30.480]  We made it shows kind of some of that that compost getting made
[28:30.560 --> 28:33.480]  we did a little example run and
[28:34.080 --> 28:41.920]  So I would say that's something that really is where I see a lot of composters mess up their diversity
[28:44.160 --> 28:50.520]  In running windrow turners and we have a windrow turner, but we only use it to mix our feedstocks
[28:51.640 --> 28:53.080]  and
[28:53.080 --> 28:57.080]  So there's some of our windrows you can see and you can kind of see the woods around back
[28:57.080 --> 29:00.920]  That's kind of the you know, just use a loader on those or a skid steer
[29:01.340 --> 29:03.640]  Well, we've got a few loaders
[29:03.640 --> 29:09.700]  And so when we actually have to turn the pile we turn it with the loader and fold it over because it's so much more
[29:09.720 --> 29:15.500]  Gentle, that's what I like to man gentle on that turn. I don't I don't like the windrow man
[29:15.500 --> 29:21.960]  I feel like it's just thrashing as I run everything through a damn tornado, right? Yeah, exactly like
[29:22.600 --> 29:30.200]  The all at least all the fun, you know the bacteria they're fine like yeah, they'll bacterial survive whatever you do, but
[29:30.760 --> 29:34.640]  The fungal organisms, they're they're a whole different story
[29:35.140 --> 29:38.880]  You know, we know spores are delicate mycelium is delicate
[29:39.200 --> 29:43.280]  Like if you if you crush a mushroom in your hands, it ain't gonna grow anymore
[29:43.920 --> 29:45.000]  so
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.680]  it's those fungal organisms that you've really got to watch out for you know, and
[29:50.120 --> 29:55.640]  So this is this is Kyle just making a test strip and what he's doing here is he's mixing
[29:55.840 --> 30:00.760]  The chicken litter and the and that's one of the reasons we don't use like wastes
[30:00.760 --> 30:06.600]  I think it's great to compost waste but because we're trying to make a very consistent product
[30:06.600 --> 30:09.080]  we always use the exact same feedstocks and
[30:09.840 --> 30:12.320]  As we're as we're making our batches
[30:12.320 --> 30:17.600]  we even send lab tests off to make sure there's no variation from year to year with the
[30:18.360 --> 30:20.360]  Places we're getting our materials
[30:20.880 --> 30:23.040]  Kyle's nice on that loader. He's yeah
[30:24.120 --> 30:28.120]  He's fresh. He's fresh. Yeah, he spent a lot hours in that thing
[30:28.120 --> 30:36.120]  Oh, yeah, and your consistency is really what allows your brand to want to be seeked out by these huge organizations here in Colorado
[30:36.960 --> 30:43.440]  You know, especially some of the I would say most commercial cannabis farmers have experience where you know
[30:43.840 --> 30:48.240]  Maybe five of the big satchels are legit and one of them is off, you know
[30:48.240 --> 30:50.240]  and it just seems like if you ordered a
[30:50.720 --> 30:55.280]  Truckload not all of them are exactly the same when you first
[30:56.880 --> 31:01.160]  You know ordering soil especially at a larger, you know, you might have ordered one sack
[31:01.160 --> 31:04.160]  So you never really experience that until you get burned?
[31:04.640 --> 31:09.100]  So I kind of wanted to put that out there if you're thinking about being a commercial cannabis farmer
[31:09.100 --> 31:14.280]  You need to know your soil just like a playbook. You didn't know everything that could potentially go wrong
[31:14.860 --> 31:20.980]  Heavy metal problems. There's just so many aspects that can potentially too many variables for you to kind of just
[31:21.580 --> 31:28.860]  Use somebody's soil, especially at on a grand scale and kind of naively think that all of that soil is the same
[31:28.940 --> 31:35.260]  It's really hard to achieve that. There's even hardly any machines. We were joking the Mitchell Ellis brand
[31:35.260 --> 31:37.940]  I mean, there's just there's not too many out there
[31:37.980 --> 31:39.980]  So you got to have the right equipment?
[31:39.980 --> 31:43.300]  You got to have the right team to be able to do this consistently
[31:43.300 --> 31:49.420]  And that's why I took the drive down here to speak with the Bart today and kind of highlight everything that's going on
[31:49.420 --> 31:52.300]  Because there's a difference in all of the different
[31:53.020 --> 31:56.920]  Brands out there. There's got to be some trust in that man, you know
[31:56.920 --> 31:59.900]  Because you know, I build my own soils for that reason, you know
[31:59.900 --> 32:06.060]  If you're gonna have someone build your soul that that trust has to be there and knowing that consistency
[32:06.060 --> 32:11.420]  they're just throwing rough numbers out of people if you want to think about it like this if you if you have a
[32:11.420 --> 32:14.460]  Soil company and they're not as trustworthy, right?
[32:14.820 --> 32:20.060]  Just say they spend a thousand bucks to haul in a truckload of you know, say sand
[32:20.740 --> 32:24.100]  Well, just think that way to that sand might be ten tons
[32:24.180 --> 32:26.820]  Well, if they're selling their product by the ton
[32:27.300 --> 32:32.860]  It's easy to go in there and throw in ten tons of sand because you're so buying it for a thousand
[32:32.860 --> 32:34.460]  But you're selling it for five or ten
[32:35.260 --> 32:38.620]  You gotta know you got to trust these soil companies, you know
[32:38.620 --> 32:38.820]  I mean
[32:38.820 --> 32:44.060]  There's there's a lot of ways that people can get over on you and I think that's one of the big things
[32:44.060 --> 32:49.580]  I like about payonia because you guys you see Bart you hear him you can listen to him
[32:49.660 --> 32:55.820]  You know, you're trustworthy and I think that your quality and that people come back to you and that you know
[32:55.820 --> 33:02.380]  These big organizations the botanical gardens and all those folks, you know, they're not using you because you know
[33:03.140 --> 33:04.660]  Because you're not trustworthy
[33:04.660 --> 33:09.340]  So I think that's off to you guys, you know for being one of those companies that are you know
[33:09.340 --> 33:14.940]  Really putting your effort into it and making sure that you get people stuff, right and it's not just like oops
[33:14.940 --> 33:20.860]  Sorry, you know, you know didn't want that to happen. You know, you can't sometimes you just can't have mistakes. So
[33:21.660 --> 33:24.900]  Definitely hats off to you guys for for that consistency
[33:25.500 --> 33:31.380]  Yeah, thank you Marco. I really appreciate that and it was what really inspired me to get into this business was
[33:32.140 --> 33:38.060]  You know you as a grower you you do something one year with somebody's product and you think you got it in the next year
[33:38.060 --> 33:42.820]  It's totally different. You got to spend the first few weeks of your season recovering from
[33:43.340 --> 33:46.860]  From these changes and so, you know, it's not easy
[33:46.860 --> 33:52.380]  but we put a ton of effort into trying to make the same product every time over and over again and
[33:53.260 --> 34:00.940]  and and nobody's gonna get anything perfect, but and certainly not us but we I feel like we try harder than a lot of people and
[34:01.620 --> 34:05.340]  And you just kind of saw there and that in the end of that Joe
[34:06.460 --> 34:11.140]  Was putting newts in and that's something we do a little different and maybe if Ken wants to pause it here
[34:11.140 --> 34:13.140]  this is a good place to
[34:13.500 --> 34:17.780]  To chat a little bit about that. That was a great use of that windrow, man
[34:17.780 --> 34:23.060]  I'd love to be able to use that when I'm blending big batches. That was that's sweet. Yeah. Thank you
[34:23.060 --> 34:29.340]  That thing was amazing. That was actually the southern ute's machine if we had to buy that thing new these days
[34:29.340 --> 34:31.340]  It's like four hundred and eighty thousand dollars
[34:31.740 --> 34:33.460]  ridiculously
[34:33.460 --> 34:37.260]  it's got an old 12-valve Cummins like all my other machines and
[34:38.300 --> 34:43.580]  it had so many leaks but we went all through it and put all new o-rings and everything and
[34:43.860 --> 34:45.860]  brought an old machine back and
[34:46.100 --> 34:51.780]  Saved a lot of money, but I also would much rather run an old machine than a new machine
[34:52.540 --> 34:58.740]  so and and basically what what we did there Joe you saw him putting some powders in and
[34:59.380 --> 35:02.580]  those are some limes and some humates and
[35:04.460 --> 35:09.900]  We even when we make our compost we try to balance it a little bit ahead of time
[35:09.900 --> 35:13.940]  We know it's going to be out from all brick ratios with the NPK
[35:14.380 --> 35:18.780]  but because it's so high in potassium, we're gonna boost the
[35:20.100 --> 35:22.100]  micronutrients there and
[35:23.740 --> 35:25.740]  We're gonna
[35:26.100 --> 35:27.900]  Really use that
[35:27.900 --> 35:29.900]  biology then to have time to
[35:31.220 --> 35:35.340]  Digest and bio convert that lime and by the time you get the compost
[35:35.340 --> 35:39.820]  That's a whole nother calcium source that you wouldn't have if you put the lime in at the end
[35:40.060 --> 35:47.060]  We also have other cow mag stuff that goes in when we make the batch, but I really feel like there's something to pre digesting
[35:47.740 --> 35:49.740]  Your your calcium and magnesium
[35:50.460 --> 35:52.460]  within the composting process
[35:53.380 --> 35:57.500]  And in a lot of ways it's kind of like KNF or something like that
[35:57.540 --> 36:03.660]  It's a it's a different way to extract a calcium and make it a usable form
[36:04.740 --> 36:06.740]  but using the aerobic
[36:07.620 --> 36:09.620]  compost microbes and and
[36:10.220 --> 36:13.460]  My favorite method of composting is aerated static pile
[36:14.140 --> 36:19.380]  We've tried different methods over the years, but we really like blowers under the piles
[36:20.220 --> 36:22.900]  I think that's the the right way to
[36:24.420 --> 36:29.220]  To save money like the windrow turners cool. I love it for mixing the stuff like you saw
[36:30.220 --> 36:33.540]  But to run that thing three times a day through a pile
[36:33.540 --> 36:39.060]  I just can't imagine the expenses so high labor everything else when you can just run a fan
[36:40.220 --> 36:41.820]  you know and
[36:41.820 --> 36:48.020]  And the city of Vancouver makes a million cubic yards of compost a year using their aerated static pile system
[36:48.540 --> 36:51.020]  So, all right, that's a great cut. Yeah great
[36:51.780 --> 36:54.020]  Technique, so I've been looking at that as well
[36:54.020 --> 36:56.980]  How what kind of spacing do you use on your pipes?
[36:56.980 --> 37:02.620]  And is that important and then how much kind of airflow is important to get through those pipes?
[37:03.100 --> 37:10.460]  It's really guys if you if you build your static pile meaning he's not turning it, but he's building it on some
[37:11.180 --> 37:15.740]  Perforated type PVC piping which then blows air up into it
[37:15.740 --> 37:19.660]  Which we know air is what's going to keep things from going, you know anaerobic
[37:20.780 --> 37:28.340]  Exactly. Yeah, and the research shows that a pile will deplete its oxygen in eight hours. And so
[37:29.220 --> 37:36.220]  You know and and it really there's a lot of engineering depending on how big you want your piles to be how tall
[37:36.980 --> 37:39.740]  Whether you're gonna layer them straight next to each other
[37:40.460 --> 37:45.660]  but a good rule of thumb is maybe you know, six inch pipe for a hundred foot run and
[37:46.740 --> 37:53.780]  And their whole patterns that matter and then when you're making your compost substrate you have to be really careful about
[37:54.820 --> 37:56.020]  like
[37:56.020 --> 38:01.020]  Your bulking agent, so we use wood chips for that and then we screen them out later
[38:02.340 --> 38:06.820]  But that really gives you some airspace some porosity in the pile to allow that
[38:07.220 --> 38:13.180]  That air to get through and then there's positive and negative pressure systems and pros and cons of each of those
[38:14.660 --> 38:18.960]  But it it's a little bit of an art, but it's fun and it you know
[38:18.960 --> 38:23.140]  It's so much less energy than this giant machine where you have to move
[38:23.500 --> 38:29.260]  thousands of tons of material every time you want to just get some air in it or are you just gonna spin a blower and
[38:30.340 --> 38:33.580]  Yeah, and that uses almost no energy and do that 15 minutes a day
[38:33.580 --> 38:37.560]  And so to me, it's so much more elegant to move the air than move the compost
[38:37.780 --> 38:39.020]  Yeah, definitely
[38:39.020 --> 38:44.720]  And everybody knows if you ever pick up a shovel and try to move a pile of compost or soils back breaking, you know
[38:44.720 --> 38:45.740]  If you don't have equipment
[38:45.740 --> 38:50.740]  I mean I have equipment and I don't even want to turn it sometime because it's still the act of taking the time
[38:51.180 --> 38:53.940]  To turn but I think a simple
[38:54.940 --> 38:59.140]  Easy technique that I'm gonna try is just like you said six inch pipe
[38:59.660 --> 39:03.300]  Small pile I got I'll probably around eight or ten yards
[39:03.300 --> 39:08.380]  And then if you say the pile depletes itself in about eight hours and you can set a timer
[39:08.820 --> 39:14.400]  Just run an electric leaf blower every four to six hours or something like that. That's it
[39:14.400 --> 39:18.260]  Yeah, three times a day is pretty much the gold standard if you don't have
[39:19.580 --> 39:21.580]  computerized oxygen detection
[39:21.740 --> 39:24.780]  So, you know just do it 15 minutes three times a day
[39:24.900 --> 39:31.820]  You're golden and and I really think it's a great method for home systems the leaf blowers a little noisy
[39:31.820 --> 39:34.580]  I mean, it'll really power it in there and it works good
[39:34.980 --> 39:41.620]  But there's blowers and all sorts of junk like I've helped people old swamp coolers are really great
[39:43.180 --> 39:45.180]  Old furnaces
[39:46.180 --> 39:50.500]  You know, you can you can find surplus places online that have old blowers
[39:51.020 --> 39:56.640]  Old inline fans inline fans any of that stuff makes a really great system
[39:57.540 --> 40:02.980]  so it's pretty easy to make a farm scale compost system out of a swamp cooler and a
[40:04.180 --> 40:08.380]  Bunch of PVC pipe and you're you're off and running and a timer
[40:08.940 --> 40:09.460]  Yeah
[40:09.460 --> 40:12.000]  I bet that I bet that end product is really
[40:12.380 --> 40:16.700]  Kind of gives a nice fluff when you dig in there at the end of kind of one of those piles
[40:17.580 --> 40:23.380]  Really because you know when you turn and turning even being gentle it still kind of packs you down each time
[40:23.380 --> 40:26.800]  You know, I mean it does taking that up turning element out of it
[40:26.800 --> 40:33.020]  I bet there's some real nice mycelium running through there nice long threads and everything. So that's it
[40:33.020 --> 40:40.260]  I've cut into piles often and just seen huge huge mycelial networks running through the entire pile and
[40:41.780 --> 40:45.900]  And it freaks people out frankly sometimes when they get one of our bags of soil
[40:45.900 --> 40:47.260]  and
[40:47.260 --> 40:51.940]  and they water it and I tell everybody, you know water your soil if you're gonna keep it around a little bit and
[40:52.620 --> 40:56.780]  And a bag of soil will often just produce a massive fruiting body
[40:58.420 --> 41:00.420]  Harvest suddenly, you know
[41:00.700 --> 41:07.820]  And they're like, whoa, what just happened? Is it mold? Is it this is it that and no, you just have to reassure them
[41:07.820 --> 41:15.220]  You know the the pathogens grow on the plants and this is why you'll have way less issues with fungal pathogens
[41:15.660 --> 41:19.260]  Because you have this species diversity of other fungal
[41:20.580 --> 41:25.940]  Organisms and they'll out compete like even if they don't actively destroy them
[41:25.940 --> 41:31.340]  Which some of them do most of them don't but at the very least they're gonna use up the fungal food
[41:31.620 --> 41:34.020]  resources that those fungal organisms like and
[41:34.660 --> 41:38.340]  And it's kind of the nature of whores a vacuum thing, you know
[41:38.340 --> 41:44.980]  It's gonna put something in there and it's probably gonna be the facarium or botrytis. You don't want so fill it up with some mushrooms
[41:44.980 --> 41:46.980]  You do want is my attitude
[41:47.180 --> 41:51.420]  Definitely and that's your decomposition as well. You know that fungi is breaking down those
[41:51.940 --> 41:56.500]  Organic particles that are still in that soil and that's also, you know feeding the plants
[41:56.500 --> 42:02.060]  So true embrace that fungi when you guys see those those good mushrooms in your so that's a good thing
[42:02.940 --> 42:04.300]  Cheers
[42:04.300 --> 42:08.580]  Yeah, people used to freak out about it, you know now it's celebrated
[42:08.580 --> 42:13.580]  So it's kind of interesting once you're starting to understand things from like a to Z process
[42:13.700 --> 42:16.760]  You know, you don't destroy something that is magical
[42:16.760 --> 42:22.700]  I mean if you're getting your fruiting bodies just you know a few flips in pat yourself on a bit on the back, you know
[42:22.700 --> 42:28.580]  You're you're really improving on mother nature. You're taking your big old brain man. You're applying that kind of stuff
[42:29.020 --> 42:33.340]  And then you'll see literally the fruits of your labor start to improve
[42:33.860 --> 42:37.260]  And if you're not then again, maybe go back in and do some testing
[42:37.260 --> 42:42.780]  I mean there's there's nothing wrong with kind of admitting to yourself that hey, I might not get this doubt in
[42:43.420 --> 42:47.100]  Until maybe a year or two and if you kind of had that going into this
[42:47.500 --> 42:51.620]  It's not so frustrating when you do have issues or maybe you know
[42:51.620 --> 42:55.100]  You got nine out of ten that are rocking in that one. You just can't figure it out
[42:55.620 --> 42:59.580]  Sometimes I've just started over so I mean there's there's ways to do that
[42:59.580 --> 43:04.460]  And then again when you do build up these, you know little utopias
[43:04.500 --> 43:10.700]  You'll realize how hard it is to keep up the consistency and the quality and again, that's why I think part, you know
[43:11.140 --> 43:15.180]  It's kind of silly to think that you'd be able to do that and if you're churning these
[43:16.340 --> 43:21.460]  Compost piles with your own shovel. I mean, you know, you know just from that aspect
[43:21.460 --> 43:29.540]  So again, I caution individuals when they're going getting into the big leagues of just running and buying soil that they've heard of before
[43:30.260 --> 43:32.060]  Do your own research?
[43:32.060 --> 43:38.580]  And then find out what's best for you. There's obviously so many different ones out there, but behind the scenes. They're all not the same
[43:39.180 --> 43:41.180]  Thanks, bro
[43:42.540 --> 43:45.860]  Who do you use for biological testing who's a good
[43:46.820 --> 43:50.020]  Source for that. Oh, there are ton of labs that do a good job
[43:50.020 --> 43:55.300]  I mean, I feel like earth for it is kind of the the old school, you know
[43:55.300 --> 43:57.700]  Obviously with the Ingham connection and all that
[43:58.820 --> 44:04.820]  You know, I I would say for me mostly I I do my work myself
[44:05.340 --> 44:09.180]  I love to just put the stuff in the scope see what's in there
[44:09.860 --> 44:15.820]  I used Ingham's original guide for quantification of organisms to
[44:16.420 --> 44:17.700]  to
[44:17.700 --> 44:21.460]  Originally educate myself and these days I feel like
[44:22.220 --> 44:27.820]  For me, you know, I'm not trying to figure out every species of bacteria in there every species of mushroom
[44:27.940 --> 44:32.740]  What I'm kind of trying to do is just look at overall populations and be like, okay
[44:32.900 --> 44:39.780]  Do we have a nice balance of a bacterial and fungals, you know, and I feel like crews get all oh
[44:39.980 --> 44:46.620]  We're all bacterial this year. It's all bet, you know fungal that year and once again for me
[44:47.020 --> 44:50.660]  And and I guess this was based on dr. Kristen Nichols
[44:50.980 --> 44:55.700]  it's these interactions between all these groups of microbes and
[44:56.260 --> 45:02.820]  The fungal and bacterial are the biggest and and it's interesting people get all hype for worms and worms are great
[45:03.100 --> 45:07.900]  But really when you look at at the number of interactions worms are super tiny
[45:08.580 --> 45:13.780]  compared to the number of interactions between fungal and bacterial organisms and so
[45:14.740 --> 45:16.740]  that really
[45:17.260 --> 45:25.260]  Sort of like drives a lot of my direction and in trying to keep this large species diversity
[45:25.700 --> 45:29.740]  Of the organisms that that I feel most affect plant health
[45:30.580 --> 45:34.020]  So that's what I'm kind of looking at is just in the scope
[45:34.020 --> 45:39.820]  What what am I seeing in that way? And then of course the plants are the the true tests
[45:39.820 --> 45:46.460]  That's that's the real lab is is doing growth tests and just keeping them going and so, you know
[45:46.460 --> 45:48.460]  My gardens here at my house every year
[45:49.460 --> 45:52.540]  And then our farmers working with our farmers
[45:52.540 --> 46:00.460]  they really give us that that real-time feedback and in the in the rare chance that we have something going on or something we
[46:00.740 --> 46:04.180]  Rely on on our network to tell us. Hey what happened here?
[46:04.820 --> 46:08.220]  It's been many years since we had something like that happen, but a good buddy
[46:09.140 --> 46:15.660]  It was it was with cookies. We were we were running our boron higher back in those days and some of these
[46:16.660 --> 46:20.540]  These indoor strains like cookies that were bred in a salt
[46:21.140 --> 46:26.540]  Chem system with no boron were very very sensitive to boron
[46:26.540 --> 46:29.360]  And so we're up closer to maybe you know
[46:29.360 --> 46:34.940]  Four or five parts per million boron which with a lot of veggies really made them more pest resistant
[46:35.060 --> 46:38.100]  But then you throw some cookies in there or it just die
[46:39.180 --> 46:42.180]  and we really figured out that it was very sensitive to
[46:43.020 --> 46:50.460]  To boron and we now run at about two parts per million boron and everything these days just for those super sensitive strains
[46:50.980 --> 46:52.980]  to to not have issues
[46:54.460 --> 46:58.220]  What are your views on copper with that as well it seems like that's kind of yeah
[46:58.780 --> 47:03.140]  Hidden kind of elements. We don't really think about it first trace trace
[47:03.580 --> 47:04.740]  Yeah
[47:04.740 --> 47:05.740]  they
[47:05.740 --> 47:09.500]  They're they're extremely important. It's the whole base of the
[47:10.220 --> 47:12.060]  plants
[47:12.820 --> 47:14.820]  health and
[47:15.380 --> 47:18.500]  To me, you know, they're they're so tiny it's easy to ignore them
[47:18.500 --> 47:25.340]  But I really feel like it's what Albrecht got right was identifying that all of these mineral elements are important
[47:25.340 --> 47:28.660]  And so yeah, I like running my copper about five ppms
[47:29.820 --> 47:31.820]  And and it's critical
[47:32.260 --> 47:34.260]  and zinc manganese
[47:35.460 --> 47:37.100]  You know
[47:37.100 --> 47:39.260]  Those the only places where we use sulfates
[47:39.900 --> 47:43.900]  it's really almost impossible to find zinc and manganese in a
[47:44.740 --> 47:46.180]  completely
[47:46.180 --> 47:48.100]  wild setting
[47:48.100 --> 47:53.780]  So so that's the place where a couple a tiny bit of a couple of vitamin grade sulfates
[47:53.780 --> 47:59.860]  I feel like help us out, but unlike a lot of these guys that are preaching single nutrient sulfates these days
[47:59.860 --> 48:02.620]  I really think you can take a lot of
[48:03.100 --> 48:09.700]  Of all of these other more organic natural ingredients and if you combine them skillfully
[48:09.700 --> 48:11.700]  Yeah, it's an art. It's tricky
[48:11.820 --> 48:16.940]  You have to look at all the ingredients independently and we have 22 ingredients in the bomb
[48:18.420 --> 48:21.260]  Which a lot of soil companies think we're insane for that
[48:21.260 --> 48:27.460]  but every one of those ingredients is something that I've been able to in my growth trials show an
[48:28.580 --> 48:30.580]  actual
[48:30.580 --> 48:32.780]  Noticeable improvement in either yield
[48:33.820 --> 48:40.740]  plant health something of that nature and so that's where the whole kind of kind of a
[48:41.700 --> 48:48.740]  Product like the bomb comes from really is just trying to have all of those elements like in my NPNK
[48:48.740 --> 48:55.860]  I've got at least two two different sources of every macro nutrient same thing through all my micronutrients
[48:56.060 --> 48:59.180]  I've got multiple sources of all my micronutrients
[48:59.980 --> 49:02.500]  You know calciums in a few different ways
[49:03.460 --> 49:07.220]  Even gypsum which Lane Ingham will tell you no. No, don't do gypsum
[49:07.220 --> 49:08.620]  It's a salt of calcium
[49:08.620 --> 49:16.260]  It is but I use a really judicious tiny amount and that really gives you this calcium shot right from the get-go
[49:16.780 --> 49:21.180]  so that you don't have to like if you if something's off with your biology or
[49:21.660 --> 49:29.100]  Or any way around it right off the bat your plant is pumped up to it to it where it needs to be on calcium
[49:29.620 --> 49:32.100]  And then you can use all these longer
[49:33.500 --> 49:38.060]  longer digesting calciums to carry the long haul through for you, but I
[49:38.900 --> 49:45.700]  Really like a little touch of gypsum there in the get-go. I think that gets you off and run it if it's used judiciously
[49:46.620 --> 49:49.940]  Yeah, I agree man gypsum is a really good
[49:50.900 --> 49:56.860]  Really great input that you know to use to build my soils. So you talked about larger scale
[49:57.780 --> 49:59.780]  diversity larger
[50:00.220 --> 50:04.060]  Soil member diversity. Do you have any of that in your bags? Will you see worms?
[50:04.060 --> 50:09.380]  Will you see anything like isopods in there? Or is that your kind of process the way it works?
[50:09.380 --> 50:15.300]  You don't really have time or those things don't emerge it during that, you know while they're still in the bag kind of thing
[50:15.540 --> 50:16.820]  Yeah
[50:16.820 --> 50:24.140]  We we've occasionally seen worms in our bags, but I don't add them. We do have a ton of micro arthropods
[50:25.180 --> 50:26.820]  and
[50:27.340 --> 50:32.260]  We actually inoculate two main species into all of our compost piles
[50:33.260 --> 50:36.940]  We use stratiolelapsimates mites and we use
[50:37.540 --> 50:43.460]  Steiner Nema feltier nematodes and at other times we use a couple of other beneficial nematodes
[50:43.900 --> 50:48.380]  But always we have those two in our pile in really high quantities
[50:49.180 --> 50:52.380]  And our entire all of our properties pumped up with them
[50:53.300 --> 50:57.940]  Are those ones you found it will just stay and you're on your property and kind of live
[50:58.980 --> 51:02.700]  Without adding more. Yeah, we get some numbers of those
[51:03.780 --> 51:11.580]  Just always recurring in our environment, but then also we're we're pumping it in that dynamic dressing compost
[51:12.380 --> 51:18.740]  Both of those species will attack fungus gnats and thrips and I feel like those are the most common
[51:19.780 --> 51:21.900]  soil based pests in Colorado
[51:22.380 --> 51:24.780]  They're just kind of ubiquitous in the environment
[51:24.780 --> 51:25.740]  and so
[51:25.740 --> 51:26.260]  You know
[51:26.260 --> 51:33.700]  You could try and build an indoor composting operation and put stickies on everybody's feet and put them in a space suit
[51:33.700 --> 51:39.980]  And you're still gonna get some of that coming in through some crack or another and so we just go the other way
[51:39.980 --> 51:45.300]  We just pump the the predators of those and so in that way, you know
[51:45.300 --> 51:48.420]  Are you never gonna get a fungus gnat with our product?
[51:48.980 --> 51:53.780]  But it's gonna be like one if you ever see one come out of our bag or something
[51:53.780 --> 52:00.820]  It's not gonna be one of those situations where you cut open a bag at California potting soil and a cloud of fungus gnats
[52:00.820 --> 52:02.660]  flies out
[52:02.660 --> 52:04.380]  You know, I actually had that written down
[52:04.380 --> 52:09.940]  I wanted to ask you so that a lot of brands call that forest stuff and I guess behind the scenes from what I
[52:10.140 --> 52:16.280]  Understand and correct me if this is wrong. What that means is that they're mixing they're stepping on it Marco
[52:16.280 --> 52:19.560]  They're going out of there and adding the filler mother nature
[52:19.600 --> 52:24.600]  So they have really no idea what they're adding into that when they're using for stuff
[52:24.880 --> 52:28.280]  Is there any of that? There's a ton of that and it's one of the things that
[52:29.320 --> 52:31.320]  We're really
[52:31.880 --> 52:38.920]  One kind of beat us up last year in kovat or maybe even this spring in kovat that when the prices of the
[52:39.600 --> 52:40.840]  premium
[52:40.840 --> 52:42.680]  ingredients went up
[52:42.680 --> 52:46.880]  Pretty much almost everyone else in the business uses uncomposted bark
[52:46.880 --> 52:51.880]  And so that was still almost free, you know or very cheap
[52:51.880 --> 52:58.600]  and so they just upped the ratios of their uncomposted bark and didn't change anything else about their mix and
[52:58.840 --> 53:05.360]  We you know said now we're gonna hold the course. I mean, yeah a container of cocoa is really expensive
[53:06.280 --> 53:13.640]  But my customers depend on this consistency and I'm not gonna suddenly start dumping some uncomposted bark in there
[53:13.640 --> 53:16.560]  I use plenty of wood, but my wood is always
[53:17.120 --> 53:21.640]  processed by the composting process over you know that
[53:22.240 --> 53:24.240]  pretty much a year's time
[53:25.240 --> 53:26.480]  and
[53:26.480 --> 53:27.640]  so
[53:27.640 --> 53:33.120]  Yeah, fungus nuts those like some of those brands where it's like almost comically known like hey
[53:33.120 --> 53:36.520]  If you're using this you got to kind of set it up for fungus nuts
[53:36.520 --> 53:37.480]  They're gonna be in there
[53:37.480 --> 53:43.240]  Most of that's coming because they're using some kind of filler and they're just not going to be able to obviously kill off everything
[53:43.400 --> 53:49.480]  That's it. And and they're not setting their biology up to kill off everything either, you know, we
[53:50.000 --> 53:55.440]  the yet they're getting everything from the forest and then they're getting everything from the fields and
[53:56.040 --> 54:01.880]  You know in an afternoon in Colorado and as the Sun setting you'll just see thousands of fungus nuts
[54:02.160 --> 54:08.000]  Everywhere just sort of lazily floating through the air. It's what makes a nice summer day nice, but
[54:08.840 --> 54:16.400]  Not if they're they're coming for your stuff. And so, you know, that's why I love making our compost and hence our soil
[54:18.240 --> 54:24.740]  Biologically active in that way we we tilt the scale towards it being a place fungus nuts come to die
[54:24.740 --> 54:27.800]  and yeah, you give us you give us you give the grower a
[54:28.480 --> 54:32.400]  Product that they can work with without having to start a fight right out the gate, you know
[54:32.400 --> 54:37.800]  I mean, no one wants to have to start battling right out the gate using using the product. So that's it
[54:39.560 --> 54:41.560]  Building that IPM in is dope
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  Thank you. Yeah
[54:44.120 --> 54:49.320]  I just wanted to say you dropped gold bars for people that are thinking of getting into the predatory
[54:49.720 --> 54:54.800]  Mites and those kind of things because there's there's a variety of them out there and I was actually
[54:55.400 --> 55:02.880]  Talking to Michigan bed officials yesterday about this how some of those big-box brands you say you get a thousand rogue beetles, man
[55:02.880 --> 55:07.840]  You're lucky of 500 are showing up alive. I mean unless you're a big big-time
[55:08.560 --> 55:12.960]  Account most people don't you know, it just feels off. So that's why I like
[55:13.760 --> 55:16.180]  supporting the the family-owned businesses because
[55:16.760 --> 55:18.980]  There's just something different about that man
[55:19.140 --> 55:25.900]  When you're taking, you know, you're putting your kind of like name in a way behind your brand name
[55:26.260 --> 55:30.140]  So it's yes. It's pay on your soil, but it's Bart Eller's company
[55:30.140 --> 55:34.960]  And that's what I like about a man is that he's you know, you can pick up the phone and he answers
[55:34.960 --> 55:39.260]  Yeah, that's pretty rare nowadays with it with some of the larger commercial things
[55:39.780 --> 55:42.100]  all over the industry
[55:45.140 --> 55:48.340]  Yeah, I appreciate it yeah, so I was gonna ask you though
[55:48.980 --> 55:56.460]  So I have let's see. I got a soil that I haven't turns, you know compost slash soil about eight yards
[55:56.460 --> 56:02.580]  Sitting on my property. I haven't turned it. Let's just natural grasses just covered up all over it my
[56:03.100 --> 56:05.380]  Next step. I'm gonna peel the grass off
[56:06.060 --> 56:09.580]  Throw that in a big jail left to do its thing
[56:09.580 --> 56:14.060]  But what do you think are what do you think our benefits or negatives to kind of?
[56:14.700 --> 56:15.820]  being
[56:15.820 --> 56:17.820]  overly, you know
[56:17.820 --> 56:23.020]  Hands-off after you have a composter or power bill. Can you be two hands off?
[56:23.180 --> 56:27.820]  Well, if it's going in a direction, you don't want if it's going anaerobic that'll be bad
[56:28.580 --> 56:33.140]  If it's already complete, you know nice and yeah, so no in general
[56:33.140 --> 56:38.100]  It'll probably be pretty pretty chill for you. And I I like a cover crop
[56:38.100 --> 56:42.860]  I'd like maybe a nice clover over it or something like that. Just help keep the biology alive
[56:43.860 --> 56:46.740]  But otherwise, yeah, it'll sit there and and
[56:47.340 --> 56:52.580]  You'll you can watch some of the profile of some of the organisms diversity change over time
[56:53.580 --> 56:58.860]  Something like that, especially if it's just baking out in the Sun under the dry heat with you know
[56:58.860 --> 57:01.700]  Or if the water drops too low something like that
[57:01.700 --> 57:06.040]  But in general it it protects itself and does pretty amazingly well
[57:06.200 --> 57:14.000]  And if you can make sure like I like a smaller blower that's sort of a maintenance blower on the finished compost
[57:15.680 --> 57:20.440]  You don't have to put nearly as much energy into it, but at least getting some air in there
[57:20.840 --> 57:24.040]  Will keep it from going anaerobic over a long time
[57:24.680 --> 57:28.160]  almost like just a breeze a gentle breeze versus the
[57:29.920 --> 57:32.360]  Hurricane the big blurs are yeah, exactly
[57:33.840 --> 57:35.840]  Yep, that's exactly it
[57:36.680 --> 57:37.720]  but
[57:37.720 --> 57:43.480]  Yeah, we have more of that video if we want to check out some more of it and this this kind of launches us into
[57:43.920 --> 57:46.400]  so here we've come back to our to our
[57:47.040 --> 57:50.000]  mix yard where I started the the whole thing and
[57:51.320 --> 57:53.480]  And you're on the ground right? No slabs
[57:54.160 --> 57:58.320]  Yeah, no, we we still work outdoors. We have several acres
[57:58.680 --> 58:01.640]  We'd like to do a big building someday and move it all inside
[58:01.720 --> 58:04.440]  But it's gonna be a heck of a building when we do it
[58:04.760 --> 58:10.880]  Would you recommend just a slab though outdoors or if you're gonna do the slab go ahead and go indoors with it
[58:10.880 --> 58:12.880]  we've we've looked into it and
[58:13.120 --> 58:20.040]  really, we just can't see the advantage and it it separates your compost from the earth and I
[58:20.320 --> 58:24.240]  Feel like I get more of the species diversity
[58:24.240 --> 58:31.480]  I want not being on the slab and then you've got the interaction between the concrete itself and the compost material
[58:32.640 --> 58:39.960]  There there are a few things that I really don't like about composting on a slab. It would have some advantages, too. So
[58:41.160 --> 58:48.880]  You know, that's certainly that's certainly a part of the whole the whole game probably in our future. It will come someday but
[58:49.600 --> 58:53.840]  For now, I'm pretty dandy delighted working outside as far as how water works
[58:54.960 --> 59:00.200]  Respiration Colorado has an amazing environment. That's just perfect for composting outdoors
[59:00.880 --> 59:03.920]  So this is a cool machine here it looks like jaws what you
[59:05.520 --> 59:13.160]  Thanks, yeah, that's that Mitchell era Ellis core buster and so we bring in our core from India it's super low you see
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  When they when they
[59:17.240 --> 59:23.640]  Use coconuts to make products over there. The core is what's left over. It's the husk of the coconut and
[59:24.240 --> 59:27.640]  if it wasn't used it would all be burned in a
[59:28.640 --> 59:30.640]  Incinerator to get rid of it
[59:31.000 --> 59:35.440]  So you can put it on a ship and then put it on a truck and send it here and you're still
[59:35.640 --> 59:39.840]  Conserving two-thirds of the amount of carbon that would have gone into the atmosphere
[59:40.320 --> 59:44.960]  so it's a waste product and a carbon negative waste product and
[59:45.600 --> 59:50.680]  I I really like it, especially when the prices are good. Here's some perlite come
[59:50.680 --> 59:55.520]  So you saw the core coming in and getting all you guys built a year old little rail line, man
[59:55.640 --> 01:00:02.680]  Yeah, we do a lot of stuff on that I like that what y'all use just some aluminum I beams or is that no no
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.480]  Actually, it's it's wood timbers that we had custom milled at the sawmill here in town
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:15.160]  It was standing dead wood and then the frame of it all there's actually like some trestle in there
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:18.960]  And that's all made out of old pallet rack that we welded
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.960]  and
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.800]  And then those rails are very specific special rails
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:29.280]  They have wheels on yeah, they've got wheels for pallet handling
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.240]  We've got the special kinds that we like
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.440]  But anyway, that line can take a full semi of any of these input materials
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.920]  So when the semi fills up and you can see we keep about ten semis
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.400]  That's that's a perlite stash right there
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:51.640]  And a drone shot right there. No, that's our crane shot. That's how you like that
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.840]  We got a lot of good camera work going on here, yeah, not bad, huh, not bad at all we tried we made this video yesterday
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.280]  Yeah
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.840]  Nice, so you like the perlite?
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.960]  You know
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.520]  And and here's our clover cover crop before we we do the perlite game
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:15.400]  What I like about perlite is perlite amazingly consistent. It gives you great drainage and aeration
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:21.120]  It's negatives I would say like over time it's gonna break down a little bit
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.200]  Depending on your growing style it can float to the top
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:29.400]  But in when I grow in like big I love growing in like a 200 gallon pot
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:35.080]  And the food web binds it all together and it just all is one big mass
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:43.160]  But I don't feel like it has the some people really say that it harms worms and things like that
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.560]  And I haven't found that to be the case
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.280]  But we do all of our mixes in
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:54.720]  A rice hole variant where we'll swap the perlite for organic non-gmo brown rice holes
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.480]  so like the raised bed mix is that version of the bomb and
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.040]  And our longevity product is made with rice holes
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.920]  and so we use rice holes a lot, but I still have a ton of people that love perlite and
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.000]  I don't hate on it as much as some people do
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.320]  And and feel like it really is an amazing amazing drainage and aeration agent. So
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:24.200]  You like it more than just pumice. I felt like that's more people using the pumice
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:30.040]  So we've used pumice over the years pumice scoria done all these mixes tests and the big thing
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:34.240]  I don't like about the pumice in the scoria is depending on the mine
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:41.640]  You get this high variability of the mineral content and when you're working as hard as we are to try and get your mineral
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:47.440]  ratios exactly right because to me that's what unlocks the next level of growth and
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:54.320]  Especially in high feeding plants and it's how we can get these results that other people don't is by having the minerals
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:03:00.800]  exactly in the right ratios and then if your pumice all of a sudden, you know, they're in a different seam and
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.920]  Now it's got a ton of this element in it or that element in it
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:11.160]  It can really knock your minerals out of whack quick and you won't even know it if you're not like testing every single batch
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:17.480]  So it's what I like about pumice is its consistency. It's and then the inertness of the
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:23.480]  Of the perilite is what indeed it's minerally inert and it's very consistent and
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:29.040]  You know, then I I don't like that that they need to run it through a furnace
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.880]  It's it's heat expanded volcanic obsidian is what what perlites made from
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:42.440]  and so, you know, I would love to find an alternative and we will probably do more
[01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.840]  investigating of mines again to see if we can find a
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:55.320]  consistent source of pumice on the scale that we need but in the meantime the rice holes really kind of filled that niche for us and
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.800]  You know the silica and the rice holes give you a lot of variation and drainage as well
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:08.480]  And then over time it breaks down, but it really holds a lot a lot more water
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:15.320]  So that's all of our rice hole mixes are kind of our like high moisture holding low water type mixes
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.480]  Yeah, I love the rice holes. They're good aeration
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.480]  I
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.840]  Like to see some of your stuff on the East Coast man, is that possible to get some your stuff out here yet?
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.360]  Are you guys? Yeah, thanks. Certainly in the full truckloads. We send semis out there
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.160]  we we don't send like little bags of soil in the
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.760]  UPS just because it seems kind of like an environmental disaster
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:47.460]  We really like shipping semis. It's 78 of our custom bulk bags on a semi
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:54.880]  And so anybody that's doing those kind of quantities. Absolutely. We could have a semi there and three or four days
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:56.480]  but
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:01.340]  We've we've got some growers with some some grow channels in Virginia right now
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:05.760]  Three of them have been talking about starting stores in there
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.820]  their respective regions of Virginia
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.760]  and
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.280]  Maybe getting some stuff to the people that way
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.760]  We really like working with farms with
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.440]  Kind of independent growers that want an independent business
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.640]  We don't sell any of our soil through big box stores or anything like that
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:37.040]  So we love like nurseries garden centers hydro stores that are independently owned and we feel like they're
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.400]  Positioned in their communities to support our soil
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:48.480]  And to give back to their community and a lot of things are going by the wayside with web businesses and all that but
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:55.720]  That's kind of the the methodology. We really like is this, you know us as a wholesale manufacturer
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:02.520]  working with these stores who really care about their people in their community to support the product and
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.320]  And and make a decent little bit of money off of it
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.880]  So if you're a farmer in your area, you want to get a few farmers together?
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:15.400]  this can really add a lot of revenue to to a small organic farm and
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.720]  and we move a lot of soil so
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:25.200]  You know get three farms together add the soil if you got a forklift and a nice place to put it
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.960]  You're off and running and and you can help your community out
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.840]  Now we had briefly talked about like, you know
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.480]  When you're taking your game to the next level with the commercial side of things
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:46.840]  So, you know just here recently you're working with a farm where they purchased a large amount of soil and unfortunately it
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.320]  didn't live up to the standards that they thought they were purchasing, you know, and that's really again the
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:59.740]  Hey, I hear that honestly every time when there's truckloads. It's just never exactly right on everything
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:00.760]  It's like you you know
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:05.200]  You're paying for the high-end thing and you get in a low-end thing on some of them
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.560]  So then you kind of as a group have to figure that out
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.760]  So I wanted to and Marco we talked about this before the show
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:16.920]  I really wanted to pick Bart's brain on this because here in Colorado. This is a huge operation
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.920]  We're not gonna talk about you know who they are
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:23.180]  But I want you guys to know behind the scenes that this is a major operation
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:31.000]  So you have a bunch of bright minded individuals at this operation that have collectively come together to pick this man's brain
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:35.040]  So I wanted to understand Bart how you were able to kind of like walk in
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.240]  You know
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.960]  sometimes the head grower feels a certain way as soon as you walk in because you're
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.880]  You know in reality you're there because something's not right
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.680]  so I know that you're really good with your people skills and I
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:54.240]  Wanted to highlight that as part of this as well as what you figured out and ways that you were able to turn around their THC
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.840]  And terpene content. Yeah. Thanks Brian
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:03.440]  It it is really interesting to see the trials that these folks go through and some of these outfits
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.160]  Are million or multi-million dollar operations
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:12.720]  You know, this place has over 20 million dollars in Nexus greenhouses
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:18.160]  but the thing I keep seeing in a lot of grows in Colorado is
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.960]  heavy metals issues and
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.600]  You know, it's it's really sad when somebody spends
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:29.840]  potentially a million dollars in a soil and then
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:36.920]  Fails and it can it can put one of these organizations and all their employees right on the edge and
[01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:42.400]  so, you know a little bit through luck, but also through
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.800]  design
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:50.720]  Even when the heavy metals regs came in and it's it's impossible to not have any heavy metals
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:58.240]  But the new regs in Colorado were admittedly over I feel overly strict on heavy metals
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:06.720]  Nonetheless from the from the very first day the regs came in all of our soils were fully able to produce
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:14.320]  Cannabis as a living soil that met all of the Colorado State heavy metals regulations and
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:20.280]  to kind of put this in perspective like the EPA regs for compost on arsenic are
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.680]  64 parts per million and
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:31.800]  We're we usually sit at around 0.6 ppm's so basically about a half of a part per million and
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:38.160]  The the amount allowed in flour is 0.3 ppm's
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.320]  So like just a third of a part per million
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:46.320]  So, you know people got really confused about this
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:53.080]  They'd send soil to a flower test lab and the flower test lab would send back a result that say it failed
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.320]  And so you have to understand, you know uptake of the heavy metals by the plant
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:05.040]  The the type of ratio, but yeah, it's one thing we've been able to do is help help our customers
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.360]  Look at their heavy metals
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:16.120]  Really like sources and the only time we've ever had a customer have an issue
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:22.600]  we've been able to track it down to you know, metal stakes from China that they're putting in their soil or
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.680]  Certain type of plastic pot that's really high in a certain heavy metal
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.080]  And so, you know, we had a couple of those in the beginning
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:36.880]  but by and large 98% of our customers were passing right off the get-go and
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.640]  there are a lot of other soils companies in Colorado that weren't and
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:46.160]  and some of them even came out with like clean mixes and things like this to try to
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:51.440]  try to get ahead of those issues that they were having with their mix, but
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:58.640]  You know to me like all of your mixes should if you can should be able to pass with the lowest heavy metals
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:06.160]  And it's been important to us and I'd say, you know one ingredient that really the only one we ever had a problem with was
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.480]  kelp and
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.240]  We used to use this
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:14.840]  Northern Atlantic kelp and we really had to get away with away from it and go to the inland
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:18.720]  Icelandic kelp just because of the naturally occurring amount of
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:25.080]  Some of these heavy metals in the ocean you just really can't use an ocean product
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:32.280]  And I assume it's maybe always been that way but also certainly in modern times with pollution
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.920]  I feel like there's a little more of an element of that and so that's kind of sad
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:42.440]  But yeah, we have to we have to stay away from the ocean products to really have this very clean
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.400]  Type product that we put out and so, you know
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:51.160]  I do feel blessed that that we didn't have to fight that as hard as some people
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:56.420]  Did but also we put a lot of work into trying to make it that way. So I think a lot of it
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.240]  Sorry, I
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:06.160]  Think you're being a little modest here. I want to again highlight that you so there's it's not like there's four people at this operation
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.160]  You know, you're probably talking a hundred plus
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.400]  And they were on the brink of you know, not being able to
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:19.160]  Obviously support that so I want our audience to realize that today's guests and all of our guests are bright-minded
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.920]  Individuals in the in the cannabis space and there's obviously a lot of different chefs in the industry
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:32.320]  But sometimes, you know behind the scenes not everybody is doing the stuff the way that you think so that's again why?
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:39.520]  You know, it's up to you especially the larger commercial farmers to do your research because once you get burned
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:46.200]  It's really hard to recover from that or like, you know, here's a company that's been around a long time to be honest
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.920]  They have everything they think they're running. They maybe want to try to improve things
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.400]  That's why everybody's so hesitant on ever, you know
[01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:55.240]  Changing the lane is because once it's up and running
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:00.240]  They don't want anything to fail and that's one of the biggest issues with living soil is sometimes
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:06.880]  They fail and they don't even understand why and it might be because you didn't do your research and you're running with the soil system
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.880]  that's not as
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:15.440]  Consistent as you think and so then that's not even on you or your team and the suits aren't gonna want to hear that
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:23.280]  I assure you that's it. That's for sure the case and yeah, it's a it's an interesting game and we've got a lot of really great
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.920]  growers and
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:30.040]  And operations in Colorado that abused us for years
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:37.540]  but it is interesting the new ones and I I do feel proud of some of these bigger ones that are that have really
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:42.800]  used what we can help them with to stay living and organic and
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:49.480]  And not go over to the salty chemical dark side and it gets tempting
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:54.560]  I really feel for them like when it's your bottom line. And yeah, your hundred employees is about to
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:57.680]  About to go go on the street
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:03.920]  You need to look at some other alternatives, but I really want people to understand that it's not living soil
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:11.080]  That's the problem. You can you can grow living soil weed that passes all the all the
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:16.000]  specs and all the regs and all the states and you don't have to just use a
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  Soilless media or something like that
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:25.760]  And I really feel like sometimes people when they can't do it they say oh well you can't do it with living soil
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:30.680]  Well, I just I don't believe that and we've proven that that's not the case
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:36.760]  Yeah, yeah, they prove as much metal stuff. There is is cool
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.080]  I really feel like it's the mineralization is what we've done with that
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.560]  Operation that I've been particularly that I feel proud of
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:50.120]  We're able to keep those beds that the same beds running year year after year after year
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:54.600]  Continuously and just producing better and better quality and you know
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:15:01.120]  It's it's proven in the terpene profile for me is is where the where the proof is in the pudding
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:05.480]  And so that's that's a whole way of these large grows to save money
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:11.840]  You know does our soil cost a little more than some sure but we're hoping you're gonna run it for two three four or five
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.160]  years and
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.160]  And be just amending
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:20.600]  what you need over that time and so we get a soils test each round and
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.640]  and
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:28.240]  Send out a custom blend and so anyone whether it's you know, whether you're farming hay or
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.720]  You're at one of these high dollar operations
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:37.320]  send us your soils tests in the in the fall and I will read them personally and
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.780]  When we've got spare time on our three mixers
[01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:47.480]  we'll make you a custom blend in the fall that you can put out in the spring and you can change your whole whole world and
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:52.940]  And so that's similar to what we did at Botanic Gardens. We're doing it across many
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:16:00.400]  Categories, but it it really changes people's worlds and gets them and the biology headed in the right direction
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.800]  Okay, I wanted to drop back a little bit so
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:09.520]  You said you your soil comes in at point three and
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.880]  flower can contain point three
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:19.480]  Our soil comes in at point six point six and flower can be up to point three. Yeah
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:24.560]  So do we know what our snake? Yeah. Oh just okay arson
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.240]  Do we know what the uptake is?
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:34.440]  So if we know if the soil is point six what the plant will do or is each plant gonna is every scenario gonna be
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:40.760]  There's definitely variability with the biology we've been trying to run some trials
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:45.640]  I would love to see more science on this but my experience is basically
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:52.120]  That as long as you're less than half or not more than double
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.760]  What the what the limit is then?
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:01.480]  You're gonna be okay. Okay, you know and there's a little bit of buffer room in there
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:07.360]  But you're you know, you're really cutting some tiny hairs down in that and
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:12.680]  And so it's the tricky thing when you're messing even with the boron or the arsenic
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:18.520]  Once you're once you're down to a part per million parts, like if you've got one molecule
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:24.160]  of this and you have to have a million more of
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:30.000]  Everything else to get it to the dilution ratio that's allowed and that's that's tricky
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.960]  You know, it is not an easy task to make a consistent thing where you're shaving apart per million
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:42.560]  Yeah, also there's a lot of I just picked up this book here
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.880]  Heavy metal toxicity and remediation by soil
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.520]  microbes
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:53.160]  So there's lots of it's pretty good reading too, man
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:58.640]  And it's like how you say you're building in your IPM because there's certain things that I can't
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.080]  Or I won't say can't but certain things I source from companies say rice holes
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.480]  I'm gonna be focusing more on those specific
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.520]  Microbiology that remediate the heavy metals as far as trying to build them into my soil
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:17.420]  So if any of these ingredients do contain heavy metals
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:21.640]  Then now those microbes are already working in my favor to break them down
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:25.920]  You know, I mean, so I think that's kind of some next level thinking
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:29.640]  As far as using microbes man, even on heavy metals
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.520]  in the isopods
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:39.520]  Plugging my own stuff, but isopods will also clean up heavy metals and just clean up everything. So decomposers, you know
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.520]  You just need the whole
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:45.640]  soil food web and once you start to achieve that I think
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:51.760]  Barts teaching you guys today that especially on a commercial level that you can really steer this
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.480]  As long as you understand your base and once you know that you have it tested
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:03.020]  Then that's when you can kind of run with it and find success because a lot of the big commercial farmers
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:08.880]  Especially when when they're first kind of getting started that first come online a lot of those guys myself
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:13.320]  Included our little group. We felt like we were flying blind there for a while
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.380]  You know, once the deal is done the soil is sold to you
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:21.660]  The the salespeople of the some of those organizations aren't as
[01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:25.740]  Excited to pick up the phone, you know because the sales been done
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:31.480]  So you and you should know that so you got to put that on you that you really need to understand this
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:39.180]  And I think hopefully today it gives you at least that red flag where we can even show you guys in real time here in
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:44.000]  Colorado that well, no, I mean this guy was is a veteran grower, you know
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.080]  It's not like he just all of a sudden made a bunch of mistakes
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:51.840]  Just all of a sudden the recipe wasn't what what they thought it was and then once they started to figure that out
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.760]  rightfully, so, you know, that's
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:02.880]  There's animosity there, you know, there's there's there's there's certain feelings that are brought up and that kind of money is spent and it's not right
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:07.920]  On that on that kind of scale Bart like when you do make those larger deals
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:13.240]  What is in writing and are people putting those kind of things in contract language
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:20.440]  Hey, this is based on I'm paying you half a million dollars based on my first run at least at the minimum not failing
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:24.840]  You know XYZ things that could be contributed to the soil
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:31.440]  Are you seeing anything like that or how's the industry usually work? Oh, no, there's I mean, it's it's crazy like
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:36.840]  and and I would expect that maybe someday and and
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.860]  You know, we would be willing to do that
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:46.360]  But most of the industry is making something different as nearly as I can tell every every week
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:51.760]  You know, and I I don't like to say names, but there's a company out of California
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:57.520]  That's big and it's got colorful bags and they've been doing this and and I when I started this I thought oh
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.000]  They at least make the same thing
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.640]  I think I can make something better
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:05.480]  but I thought they were making the same thing and then you go out and you start testing the bags and
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.600]  Out of one store I had four bags that
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.280]  Pretty much every everything
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.920]  Minerally about that each one of those bags was completely different and that really shocked me
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:20.900]  I didn't realize like how much variability there is
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:24.920]  so I would think it would be very hard for most companies on the market to
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.760]  To sign some sort of agreement like that
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:37.080]  But more and more I expect it because yeah, you get kind of hung out to dry if you get the wrong stuff and so
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.840]  You know, it's it in a in in a way. It's why we
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:48.120]  If somebody ever says they've got a problem. I'll start getting some soils test on
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:55.360]  I'll look into it and see what it is. We'll we'll come out there help you out say hey what's going on here? But
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:58.120]  but it's rare and and
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:03.920]  When it happens though, you need somebody to back you up and and I do think that's something
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:09.820]  maybe that we're a little different or unique about is that that we want to back every one of our growers up and if
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:12.560]  If somebody can show me that it's not working, right?
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:16.440]  Then that's the most interesting thing I can see I want to go see why that could be
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.360]  And maybe get ahead of it for another customer or something like that
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:28.180]  Yeah, very smart and to me though, you know with that operation you mentioned is that something that you know kind of testing when?
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:35.380]  Here's my first delivery. Let me send this out for testing myself, you know as the grower or the owner operator
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:40.160]  Is that something that could have been avoided early had that even been done?
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:45.960]  Do you think or do you know enough about it? It could have been but I think I think what happened is that
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:54.220]  These laws came into play and it was right around the time people were putting in new new facilities and things like that
[01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:58.100]  And so, you know nobody knew about it
[01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:03.340]  and this was a couple years ago and and a lot of people hit a
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.260]  hit a pretty hard brick wall when
[01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:12.980]  when some of their stuff didn't work the way they needed it to and when you've done a big investment like that into
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:16.700]  Into this dream you have and into all your people and then it fails
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:22.660]  Yeah, it's a whole you you really just have to have to kind of
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:30.460]  It would be nice if folks would would at least kind of stand behind it or try to help out or something but
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:34.460]  But there are ways to deal with it, you know, as you guys mentioned
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:40.700]  there are a lot of ways to remediate heavy metals and so, you know, that's been able to happen to so
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:46.940]  Yeah, let's keep like so just we I guess we took a little lane from the video
[01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:53.260]  But I definitely want the audience to see that there's there's so many problems behind the scene
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:57.340]  So you guys are you know, if you're having issues when you're first getting into this
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:03.680]  Everybody does so just remember that you're you know, the fact that you're with us every single week
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:09.820]  You're improving a lot at a lot higher rate faster rate than your competition than your peers
[01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:12.740]  And even if you're an underground individual, you know
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:17.060]  You have to not only have your product but your product has to be so much better than
[01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:23.500]  Even the dispensaries that people are willing to even you know, call you so all of this time and effort that you're putting into
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:28.700]  you know, you're seeing also from behind the scenes that on a commercial side of
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:32.700]  Cannabis it can be done. Of course
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:37.180]  But there's very few people that are able to do it consistently time and time again
[01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:39.520]  And that's why you hear the same names from our shows
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:46.080]  On the commercial side of stuff with living so is because there's really not that many yet that are doing it
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:50.080]  And so that's why we're continuing to pumping out this education because that's what we want to see
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:54.260]  We definitely want to see the the guys that have these major operations
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:58.960]  Be able to talk to their investors and say hey, we want to try this and again
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:04.360]  That's why I think you know major operations are picking Bart's brain because it is possible
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.680]  You just really have to understand what you're doing
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:12.760]  Yeah, thanks and and it is nice to see that movement because this planet is
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:16.440]  Not gonna last much longer if we don't make some changes and
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.400]  And just doing it the old way and working
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:27.400]  All right, so you mentioned we got some cover crop glow growing here. Yeah, this is some white clover. I really love white clover
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.720]  I like it
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:35.080]  for keeping weeds suppressed and you know, just if we're gonna have some bare dirt, we're gonna have something nice growing there and
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:41.000]  You know, we'll put California cuz mites into our clover and then any stray
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:46.800]  Russets or spider mites or something like that. They're falling into a trap
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:48.840]  and
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:53.120]  And I feel like there's a lot to that and then we're gonna start up a batch here
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:26:00.360]  So depending on the peat base, you know, you're gonna start with some sort of a peat base. This is the sphagnum we get
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:05.920]  It's a really high grade sphagnum. It's sustainably harvested by the same family for over 30 years
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:13.460]  They don't just mine it they use large vacuums to vacuum harvest it in New Brunswick
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:16.680]  And it's a grade that typically only goes to Europe
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.040]  So I was all cocoa in the beginning of the company and then I found this really cool sphagnum
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.040]  And now I kind of like a half-and-half
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.120]  blend of those peats as a base
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:30.100]  And then this is where the magic really happens this is like
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:37.520]  all of the nutrients the worm castings the fossilized seabird guano the kelp the fish bone meal
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:45.080]  Citric acid on and on all the different things that we use in our mix and it's it's already been metered out to
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:53.720]  The precise ratio and it's the reason we still use batch mixers a lot of bigger operations run continuous mix line
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:57.500]  But you just don't get the consistency out of a continuous mix line
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:01.600]  That you get with the batch and there may be ways to fix that in the future
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:06.840]  But for now for us we've got three of the bigger batch mixers in the state. They're ribbon blenders
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.080]  and
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:12.780]  This one this one's named mixturist. The other one is sir mix a lot
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.760]  How many yards?
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:17.760]  These can do 15 yards each
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:21.480]  we do different size batches, but and
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  Then Beatrice our front end loader
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:29.000]  and this is the core pit that you saw earlier where the core was getting chopped and
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:36.600]  What are those a big concrete blocks and you just lined them with like a rubber kind of to keep them from scraping off the
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.560]  Dust and yeah, they're there
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:43.680]  They're calling V blocks a gravel pit use them and then we've got a whole whole
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:48.560]  Frame up there and I like using belting that's actually old mine belting
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:55.360]  We buy that surplus and once again, it's just part of our ethic of like reusing recycling upcycling
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:58.960]  If there's anything old we can use we're going to use at first
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:03.120]  rather than buy something crazy new and expensive and
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:08.400]  it's really the only way we can make a soil like this at any sort of a reasonable price is
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:16.080]  Is by kind of taking these extraordinary efforts to keep our prices low and our quality high
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:21.520]  And so you'll find a lot of weird old machines around our place that have fancy Hitachi
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000]  drives and and high efficiency electric motors on them and
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.940]  But like the steel steel and really they made the steel better back in the day so
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:39.880]  You know, it's a little bit like an ancient spaceship around this place or something like that, but I like that man that's
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.280]  What you guys
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:47.280]  Quality that's coming out of it. And yeah the cocoa man with some of these soils Marco
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:50.520]  It's course to the touch like, you know
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.360]  brands
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:52.960]  You know
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:55.280]  They're finished product is a little course like if you're really
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:00.520]  Putting in doing a bunch of clones or something finish something else your hands are just feel like cut up
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:06.320]  And I think a lot of that comes from just being course sometimes even cocoa probably a variety of things
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:11.120]  But there's one in particular man that when I when I felt it it had like a velvety
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:17.360]  Touch to it. And so how are you achieving that on a grand scale like that? Yeah, it's
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:24.720]  It's about vendor selection material selection, you know, and of course you don't want it super fine
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:27.120]  you want the porosity in there, but
[01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:30.120]  but by kind of
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:37.480]  Choosing these elements and then you would be surprised how much the minerals contribute to that velvety feeling to like in a batch of
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:41.640]  the bomb there are hundreds of pounds of you know ground rock and
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:47.360]  All sorts of different minerals and organic matters and
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:51.760]  all of that all of those 22 ingredients add up to something and
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:59.440]  For us I've never felt a soil like ours and I really do think it's it's a little bit of all of those
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:02.800]  22 different things kind of makes that whole
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:11.320]  Whole end product a certain way. But yeah, thanks. I'm glad you like that feeling and these 500 pounders
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:19.280]  They're about 450 pound and actually coming back to your putting sand in thing. We do everything by volume not weight
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.040]  Because our moisture is variability by the season
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:28.920]  like if it's the middle of the winter and somebody's gonna get a 400 pound ice cube, right and
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.920]  The microbes don't need as much water
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:36.840]  Then we won't put as much water in if it's the summertime and it's hot out and we know those
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:41.000]  The our little friends are gonna be needing to drink on the truck on the way there
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.360]  Then we're gonna be pumping the moisture up
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:50.760]  so for us it's about volume not moisture and we even kind of overfill all of our all of our stuff too, so
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:56.720]  You know, I don't know if it works out that way, but it's just the kind of person I am I'd rather like over
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:02.600]  Over-deliver on an under promise or something like that. We need more just like you
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.960]  Everywhere. Yeah, thanks, but then they're not calling you if it is a little bit, you know
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:10.920]  It's I think it's so much easier and less of a headache if you just give a little extra
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:16.080]  You got a bag of soil coming buddy. You know, I mean, it's not don't break out your scale
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.080]  This is a pay on your bag
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:23.240]  That's it just for you and it it you know, it means a lot to me
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:30.440]  I realize like when a grower buys one of those bags for you know, $400 or whatever. They they cost at the store
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:36.040]  that that means a lot to me that somebody took their hard-earned money and they
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:43.640]  Put me in charge of their dreams and that's what I realize you're basically doing when you plant anything is you're you're
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.600]  you're you're planting a dream and
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:52.420]  It means a lot and so this section here is interesting because our bags were the only ones in the industry
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:54.620]  That reuse our tote bags
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:32:02.020]  There's a $10 deposit and particularly our large commercial customers in general have and that's Cartier. That's our
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:04.580]  mascot
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:07.380]  That's right and
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:12.500]  and so it it's a huge thing when these totes come back and
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:18.020]  Then we wash them and it's it's no small effort to wash all those bulk bags
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:25.100]  Kind of saw what those guys went through there and that those those all came back from a big grow and
[01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:32.380]  You know somebody cut a third of them stop and now you can't use them again the ones that come back nice
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:38.560]  Some of those go out ten times and that is so much less plastic
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:42.980]  So it's a really low waste stream way of selling soil
[01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:49.860]  It's it would be so much cheaper and easier for us if we didn't have to do that, you know if we just
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:55.780]  Bought a lot of new one and threw it out way cheaper, but we have this program
[01:32:56.420 --> 01:33:00.960]  We really believe in it and and if you can send those totes back to us
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:06.540]  We'll wash them make sure they're nice and clean and we'll turn them back around and send them right back to you
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:11.420]  These are the guys I like right here. These are the guys that I say you're getting paid to work out
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:19.760]  That's it you get paid and you get the workout what's better than that fitness plan built in yeah, we've got a really great team
[01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:25.860]  Pegas Kyle Corey Robbie Joe Joe
[01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:29.700]  Ton of ton of great guys out here that
[01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:32.260]  but
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:36.760]  Do a lot of hard work and put a lot into making sure that
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:42.960]  That what you gets great and grows great things and then this is kind of the results of that
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.400]  These are some gardens my wife did
[01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:49.520]  No, I've got this this one. We we pumped up this spring
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.560]  Here are some other ones. It's October
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:56.560]  And we're still we've still got hydrangeas bloom in good color
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:03.080]  The stuff's a little beat up this time of year, but it's still going and so to be growing hydrangeas this time here in Colorado
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:05.880]  I feel like is is no small feat
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:13.800]  And and then here we'll kind of and and the lawn to no nitrates in this lawn high species diversity
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:15.680]  clover
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.680]  creeping Charlie
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:19.840]  water tolerant fescues
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:21.960]  and
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:29.720]  And here's some zinnias, and then I'll just kind of this quick goes through the tomato plants are still pumping tons of tomatoes
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:36.120]  And I'm a lazy gardener. You know I'm like the mechanic that doesn't deal with his garden or whatever so we put this stuff out
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.240]  And we pretty much mostly set it and forget it
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:42.200]  We sprayed some soap for some squash bugs
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:47.160]  But you can see some big spaghetti squash over there
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:52.240]  You know and that was the thing because when you reuse the bags here
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:56.720]  I just yeah, we we use the bags here, and then we put the bamboo on to
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:02.080]  To protect them from the Sun and so that's a 200 gallon grow bag basically
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:07.520]  Aerating on the side the broccoli is still still generating broccoli
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:09.960]  Here's some carrots
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:13.380]  We'll be pulling carrots out of that through past December
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:18.380]  Same thing with the potatoes too, so this is kind of the company trial garden
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:22.360]  but you can see those species diverse carrots there and
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:30.880]  You know probably about four different varieties of potatoes that we ran in this garden this year
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:34.920]  But everybody who works here all those guys who make soil
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.920]  all all
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:41.800]  Are out in it our sales team to you know Kate Emma?
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:46.160]  Riley they all have worked on farms have their own
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.800]  gardens
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:56.200]  We're all just into this we love it, and that's why we do it, and yeah, we might not be the biggest web presence, but
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:01.800]  We move a lot of semis is some pretty badass oil, and we're proud of what we do and
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.640]  Yeah, hope people enjoy it to you basically
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.360]  It feels like a family environment here
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:12.560]  I mean this is his home said and his employees were right out
[01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:16.920]  We know when I first pulled up, so I mean this is when you're talking about a family-owned business
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.520]  it definitely has that feel and
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:24.880]  MacGyver aspect to it as well. You know like all those tractors and everything man
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:31.480]  They're all running. You know that's kind of the cool aspect of it might not be the the shiniest, but you
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:36.400]  From you know working at Buffalo and stuff. I know hey. He's got the Mitchell Ellis
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:42.080]  I know that's the Rolls-Royce of the the Cocoa choir buster. I mean I researched that shit myself
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:48.800]  You know and you know the quality of your cocoa it can go hydrophobic if your brand starts to buy from a different
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:55.240]  Vendor I've personally seen that when we were mixing stuff, and you know the other we had a new owner that
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:01.160]  Care less about quality so the ingredients went down and we started having hydrophobic issues
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:07.120]  And it's because of you know shitty cocoa, so there's a lot of ways to really fuck this stuff up man
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:10.960]  And cocoa can come in real salty to on you like I've had before
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:18.560]  Where the owner or some cocoa from some source and shit was salty as hell plants look like you know
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.520]  What the shit, and then we did a little test of the leachate and freaking PPM was off the chain
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:27.200]  Just out of the cocoa, so you guys definitely careful about that
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:33.000]  so yeah every one of our every one of our containers of core that comes in we tested ourselves and
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:37.200]  And we have a spec ours is 0.3
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:43.960]  EC is our max that will accept and otherwise we make them take it back
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:49.440]  There you guys are you're going around educating a lot in Colorado, that's something else that I like
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:53.280]  You know you guys are going out of your way to continue to educate
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:38:00.880]  From just kind of smaller farms all the way to like I mean Cherry Creek mall is kind of the mall in Denver, Colorado
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:08.640]  So I mean you're you know you're you're all aspects of it. Yeah, thanks, buddy, and yeah, it's a it's a pretty fancy place
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:12.920]  We've got some big fancy customers. We've got a lot of little customers that
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:19.920]  That are really important to us to flower farms you can kind of see there on the instant. That's a little hollow flowers
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:27.760]  We've got a whole lot of flower farms these days, and so that's our cut flower mix in custom four-foot smart pot
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:35.200]  Raised beds, and they were able to like quadruple their yields they got longer stem length better pigmentation
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:42.340]  The living soil can can deliver whatever you're looking for pretty much in whatever industry
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.060]  And that's what I love about it
[01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:50.020]  And it's one of the things some people sort of get who about is that like the bomb our high feeder mix is
[01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:54.100]  designed for both like high feeding veggie annuals
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:39:01.020]  And it's kind of at the high end of nutrient balance for those, but then also for cannabis and it's
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:08.940]  three weeks with no feed and cannabis is the system that we like to use and then start in with like a liquid amino or
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:10.660]  top dress with some
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:16.640]  Some feather meal for fluff for the rest of edge and then in flowering we like doing
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:22.140]  Our dynamic dressing compost which is like a one two three and
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:29.900]  And a lot of people are like what compost is a flowering newt, but really you know you've got that high FOSS high potassium
[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:36.900]  You've got calcium magnesium. You've got trace minerals. You've got micronutrients, and you've got the biology and
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:39.740]  And then you just kind of tune
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:45.380]  The FOSS after that depending on your strain and so we use fossilized seabird guano
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:48.420]  it's a zero ten zero and
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:52.540]  And then if you're if you are doing KNF stuff
[01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:57.060]  That works really well in that same same kind of world
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:02.660]  You know you might not have to do as much, but for the people who need a really simple system. It's just
[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.860]  run the bomb
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:12.100]  Do your nitrogen tune it to your strain and veg and then run the dynamic dressing and the
[01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:14.220]  fossilized in flower and
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:17.780]  You can adjust your FOSS to your FOSS hungry strain
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:22.740]  Like a like an expert and it's it's so simple
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:29.100]  it's just really that simple and other than that do that maybe twice once right before flowering one at the end and
[01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:35.460]  Water and that's it and and you can have amazing results out of that system
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:38.980]  So yeah nice
[01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:44.340]  Yeah, it doesn't have to be difficult. We say it all the time JLF sir key
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:50.860]  You know get you a great soil man, and then you make some JLS one for veg one for flour and
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:54.020]  Should you can just take it all away grow some really?
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:56.020]  quality
[01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:58.020]  product and food
[01:40:58.460 --> 01:41:03.260]  Exactly yeah, and and that's it and I really do love the ferments. You know there
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:08.740]  There's a whole world of that a buddy here started making a nettles horsetail ferment maybe
[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:16.380]  12 years ago that was my introduction to the whole thing and and seeing the results he got out of that even as a silica
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:19.620]  kind of
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:24.060]  Yeah, it was it was crazy it made those plants like bug proof
[01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:31.700]  They would try to bite a bite a plant and the silica in a foliar just you know made the plant basically
[01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:34.860]  impervious to bugs yeah
[01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:37.340]  definitely
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:42.500]  So you're so you kind of like a family outfit so your employees then understand
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:46.940]  Hey, don't run my equipment hard this equipment has to get us paid
[01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:52.940]  This is you know if we fix less equipment we get more Christmas bonus is that you guys got that kind of relationship?
[01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:57.900]  Where you know they get it the whole kind of business aspect and what it takes?
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:03.180]  Absolutely yeah, no, I'm blessed to have guys that really do care and
[01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:10.660]  You know like my backhoe that I started this company with that was that was my half of my grandfather's inheritance
[01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:16.700]  And I had it from my other place, and I was a crazy guy that thought I'm gonna start this soil company
[01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:22.620]  Because all my buddies had organic farms, and we're living out here and nobody can get consistent stuff
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:27.980]  but yeah that that machine is has been working for me for over 20 years and
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:35.740]  And and these guys know that that stuff's important and and that you might think running the old machines that that somehow
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:40.140]  They're less reliable, but really in a way these machines are designed to last forever
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:44.740]  and so we do we kind of have a relationship with the machines we treat them well and
[01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:48.540]  And have a great maintenance program every Monday here
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:53.460]  Is a maintenance day and the guys are going through all the machines and making sure they're greased well
[01:42:53.460 --> 01:43:01.820]  And and that everything's top-notch to start another week and and in doing that in kind of putting that attention towards the machines they
[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:08.580]  They work for us year after year, and yeah, you got to fix them you got to fix this and that but it's amazing to
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:13.100]  me the the life that these machines can give and and our guys are the
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:16.580]  The first line is the operators of these machines
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:18.540]  Who
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:24.660]  Who cares for them and who keeps them keeps them running well, so I can't say enough about both our team and and
[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:26.540]  The work they do
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:27.060]  Yeah
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:31.800]  And also just to give the audience a little bit more deeper on the equipment like you're running these big
[01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:34.380]  Tractors and stuff if you have a hydraulic hose burst
[01:43:35.060 --> 01:43:37.700]  Depending on where it might ruin a whole batch
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:43.140]  Like so you got to have you got to be kind of watching your stuff and being on point with everything you're doing out there
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:44.100]  so
[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:49.220]  Yeah, it's important. You know you can lose a lot of money easily with some raggedy equipment
[01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:53.220]  For sure there's a difference between old and raggedy
[01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:58.900]  You know raggedy is what we don't want old and quality and reliable is what we do want and pay for
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:06.220]  Here's to that and you're saying you use like the Hitachi motors and stuff you it seems like you just kind of really know
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:08.340]  What's gonna last?
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:10.500]  Instead of you know it's crazy
[01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:13.780]  We can we can kill things out here if if it's not
[01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:19.260]  Top quality we will destroy it in a heartbeat. I mean we bought we bought these
[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:21.580]  baits
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:28.660]  Military boots two years ago. They didn't make it six months. We bought Danner the whole team Danner
[01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:33.500]  $300 Danner boots they didn't make it a year they were under warranty
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:36.620]  They gave us all our money back like we're hard
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:40.820]  We work hard, and we're hard on machines and equipment if it's not
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:48.180]  Engineered for kind of the long haul then yeah, we will destroy it and so that has taught me over the years like
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:55.320]  There are brands. I've come to rely on and come to say yeah this this will keep working and those Hitachi drives
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:58.260]  I've never blown one up there. They're super badass
[01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:03.460]  Whose boots are y'all rocking and since see what kind of ran everybody through it?
[01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:08.260]  They're they're running ariet right now. They're trying to trying the
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:14.660]  $340 area it super duper steel work. I like I like red wings red wings
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:18.060]  That's what I was gonna say okay. I see a lot of people use
[01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:26.500]  Heavy construction I was 300 pounds were walking job sites and red wings would definitely hold up to it there you go
[01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:31.540]  We had red wings a few years ago, and we've been trying to trying to find some fanciers
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:33.780]  But maybe we just need to go back to the Red Wings well
[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:36.300]  We'll give them around next
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:41.020]  That's crazy, man. You never know we talk about on this show we talk about a little bit of everything
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:47.540]  Hey, man, if your employees are you know
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:51.680]  They don't have the right equipment man. They're not gonna be getting the job done
[01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:57.420]  Yeah, I think I think putting time and effort into your employees pays huge dividends
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:04.940]  Especially not having to retrain someone you know now it's something that I'm you seeing that a lot of the cannabis spaces in
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:11.880]  Colorado man is you walk into a dispensary walk into a grow very rarely are the same under faces
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:14.100]  You know you might see the same top individuals
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:19.700]  So you can tell like you know they must be every other month training a new team how to grow
[01:46:20.020 --> 01:46:23.740]  And as I had as a head grower. That's got to be a nightmare
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:30.780]  It's like teaching a playbook every month to a new team you guys aren't gonna ever really start to gel
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:34.700]  Because now we got a whole new offense now. We got a whole new thing to think about
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:40.900]  So from what I understand you've been doing this early 2000s Bart. Yeah, well
[01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:45.420]  I've been making my own soils and growing organically really since
[01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:53.700]  Probably about the early 90s like 92 93 I was doing some aeroponics back then actually
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:58.100]  You know and that was just on the scene, and I was like oh, that's cool
[01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:04.420]  And I've got my nutrients at NASA uses and all that and then a buddy a buddy
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:08.260]  Turned me on to the permaculture Bible. I was over in mobile
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:10.460]  Moab and
[01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:17.940]  He he had I don't know if you all know that original the kind of $300 big thick permaculture book from Australia
[01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:22.820]  But seeing that changed my whole world you know it it really showed me
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:25.860]  Oh, maybe there's a different way to do this and it started
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:31.420]  Informing how I how I worked with the soil and then when we moved here
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:33.500]  95
[01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:38.740]  That's when I started using some of the local chicken litter and making compost out of that and seeing
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:42.300]  The results my wife and my wedding we grew all the veggies
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:47.820]  in this in this what most people think's pretty lousy soil out here with
[01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:51.700]  mostly a chicken litter as our entire fertility program and
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:48:00.420]  That really informed and educated me and so I've been making living soil for for yeah pretty much 30 years or something and
[01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:05.980]  In one way or the other and doing it for a living since
[01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:12.260]  2012 so this is our 10-year anniversary as a as an official company
[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:17.860]  That's awesome. Most people don't make it two three years. Oh, thanks, buddy. Yeah, I
[01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:21.400]  I guess that's why a lot of people are afraid to do it
[01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:25.080]  But when you do things right man, you're obviously taking care of your employees
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.840]  10 years is
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:31.320]  Something solid as you're in it to win it
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:38.120]  Yeah, thanks. It's it's been really rewarding. It's hard. It's definitely blood sweat and tears and
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:44.800]  People don't realize that and that's why when somebody asked me are you worried about a competitor this that or the other like?
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:50.440]  This is probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I came at it with a lot of resources to do it
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:53.200]  But it is so rewarding and
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:59.220]  And it just I don't know it's a it's a great thing. We don't get rich doing it. That's for sure
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:04.640]  but we feel good about what we're doing and knowing that millions of dollars of
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:07.760]  People's faith is in us every year
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:14.520]  Particularly in this region and then the other states that we've moved into over the past few years that
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:18.880]  That means a lot to us and it's a relationship between
[01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:27.080]  us the store and the consumer in the end of the product and each person in that relationship is just as important and
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:31.920]  And if it's not good for anybody in there, then it's not good for the rest of us
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:36.680]  so we really believe in that philosophy that we're in it together and
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:38.800]  and in the end
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:44.560]  It makes us proud to make some really badass soil and it makes us proud to see what you guys grow in it
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:46.560]  And it's usually something amazing
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:52.160]  How many um yards are you guys producing out there years that something I mean
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:57.400]  Thousands, you know, it varies but we'll probably do
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:01.320]  You know ten thousand plus yards this year
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:05.600]  I haven't looked at the numbers real recently
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:12.680]  When we did compost we made two million pounds of compost last year and that's kind of a cool thing because
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:18.480]  You know at a 19 to 1 carbon to nitrogen ratio. That means we're putting away
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:23.240]  1.9 million pounds of carbon and
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:26.640]  That would have gone into wood
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:30.440]  fuel pellets otherwise and so
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.680]  you know, that's a really like
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:37.120]  Quantifiable amount of carbon put away and then
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:39.760]  You know the company does burn carbon
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:45.120]  So I've tried to quantify that as well and it seems like we're well under probably half a million pounds
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:50.280]  So, you know, we're pretty much 1.5 million pounds net negative
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:53.200]  worst-case scenario and
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:59.680]  And I feel proud about that and then with our upcycled machines and our tote recycling plan
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:02.640]  I feel like we're a pretty sustainable business
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:06.840]  that's trying to head this thing in the right direction for everyone and
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:14.760]  Then the carbon that our growers sequester by putting it into this product like those roots are going to do something and
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:18.160]  You know, it might be five years. It might be ten years
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:25.360]  But every time somebody grows something in our soil and doesn't just throw it away or burn it or something like that
[01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:31.680]  That sequesters that and it helps helps make this whole planet better potentially for all of our kids
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:38.400]  Keeps it locked away for a long time. You know, I mean keeps that carbon bound up. That's good. Nice
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:40.920]  What are you?
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:45.960]  Challenges, you know from a business standpoint like where this name a couple things are like man
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:49.360]  This is always a worry. Is it is it getting your ingredients?
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:51.840]  Has that been a chore with the new technology?
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.280]  Absolutely, you know materials costs are crazy and
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:59.920]  We put a lot of work last year into
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:04.320]  having all of our materials pre-purchased and
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:11.240]  Even here on one of our properties through the winter so that we would have enough to deliver for our customers
[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:16.760]  Yeah, CO2 emissions are a big issue. So we're trying to get our CO2 emissions down
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:18.760]  So
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:23.080]  That was super challenging and every year it's something different you never know what it's gonna be it could be
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:30.600]  The weather it could be this it could be a materials sourcing supply chain problem. It could be
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:33.760]  rains in Canada it could be
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:36.200]  a
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:37.760]  a
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:39.760]  a
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:41.760]  a
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:43.760]  a
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:46.120]  Rains in Canada could be
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:49.520]  Trucking strike dock workers strike
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:54.120]  This mine shuts down or that fire someplace
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:59.720]  and so it's it's hard like there's no two ways about that what we do is is
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.640]  tough and it takes our entire team and we
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:06.760]  We do more than you would think for for being our
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:12.840]  little team here we we pull off a lot, but it it takes a lot of thought and
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:17.200]  You know business small business is tough and
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:24.240]  we're going against the miracle grows of the world and they're making billions of dollars and
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:28.120]  They don't even know what's what's in their mix. So
[01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:34.480]  Pretty much we have to be better on every front. We have to we have to be cost competitive
[01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:39.880]  We have to make a superior product. We have to be local. We have to be organic
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:46.120]  You yeah, you pretty much have to do everything right and then maybe somebody will be like, okay
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:50.320]  We'll give you a pallet space in our store. Well, we'll give you a try
[01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:56.320]  But I don't know. I just I think that's kind of the fun of the game is is can we do this?
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:58.320]  Can we be some little guys that?
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:03.640]  Started in our backyard and now we're on 36 acres and there's no pressure there
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:08.360]  You you just grew into what you are, right? I mean, it's like this is what we're doing
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:12.240]  This is what we're doing, I mean there was definitely plenty of pressure but
[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:16.680]  But I try we try not to let that dictate what we do
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:22.360]  I got you and then um, so you guys run in winter too like it's brutal there
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:24.040]  So yeah, we do
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:30.160]  our customers go year-round and we go year-round and we have a whole winter program and we
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:33.240]  move more of our stuff inside and we've got a
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:37.240]  16 by 32 building that we use for a lot of that stuff
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:42.820]  But our whole thing is designed to be able to go through the winter and keep keep mixing
[01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:45.720]  so you just blend kind of your
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:51.120]  Amendments indoors and then go ahead and take it all outside to do the large pile mix
[01:54:51.720 --> 01:54:56.540]  Exactly. Yep, and and we've got covers over the workspaces out there and stuff
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:55:02.400]  But you know if it's a three-foot blizzard or something, we're not gonna whip the guys to get out there
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:07.800]  We'll say take the day off and that's right and let's pick it up and that's the nice thing about Colorado is
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:10.000]  There's always a sunny day coming soon
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:13.160]  So amen to that, that's it
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:17.440]  and and sometimes it's even the easiest when it's all just frozen out there in the winter and
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:20.320]  you've got everything dialed the way you want it and
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:22.800]  Just make it happen
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:28.400]  But we make a lot more soil in the summer and spring obviously is our big real go-go time
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:34.800]  And every year pretty much our our demand kind of gets to our capacity
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:37.840]  If not exceeds at the last couple years, we've been able to
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:42.800]  To keep our capacity with with some spare year-round and so that's nice
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:47.080]  That now we have orders now first. Oh, yeah
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:53.800]  Absolutely. Yeah, we've got people putting in orders and just making sure they've got exactly what they want when they want it
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:56.800]  And like I said, this is kind of custom
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:55:59.440]  Custom newt season
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:04.280]  Like anybody that that wants that service now is the time to go
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:11.920]  Take your soils tasks and get ready and get with us in the winter while we've got some some extra time and capacity
[01:56:11.920 --> 01:56:17.560]  And we'll make you a fancy custom newt as long as you need, you know enough of it
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:22.280]  Those are big mixers, but basically for for farm scale stuff
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:25.680]  This is the time and then we'll do that through the winter
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:28.800]  We do a lot of shows in the winter
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:33.120]  And we build machines that winters are our machine building time
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:37.880]  We get right back to it get all the welders back out again and go right back into fabricating
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:45.160]  And then it really started your machines. You're saying or upgrade our equipment for the next season. Okay?
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:48.440]  yeah, just just building cool upgrades and
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:51.560]  Add-ons and
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:59.320]  That's it yeah something whatever the pinch point the the thing that slowed us down last season was we'll figure out a way to fix it
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:00.560]  and
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:03.960]  And just get that much better and we we do
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:10.520]  Typically about on a whole as the company we've done about a 30% annual growth every year
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:15.160]  We were poised this year to be able to do a hundred percent growth, but then
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:20.480]  With the whole greater industry, you know, obviously nobody was seeing that
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:23.000]  I mean there were soil companies on the West Slope
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.200]  I know of at least seven soil company or on the West Coast that went out of business
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:29.280]  in
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:31.200]  California, Oregon
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:33.920]  We heard Fox farm laid off a bunch of their staff
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:36.920]  and so
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:39.560]  Yeah, it's a lot of people are hurt
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:45.240]  And so I feel blessed that we were able to at least stay up into the end of levels that we were this year
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:47.240]  so thanks to our customers and
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:51.760]  But yeah, it makes us feel like maybe we're doing something right here and
[01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:55.120]  Well family-owned businesses, you know
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:59.800]  You can kind of trim the fat like you're in the trenches every day where these larger brands
[01:57:59.800 --> 01:58:05.720]  They might not know what's slowing down production, you know, they're in their office all day. They don't actually even touch the soil
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.240]  So there's a there's a big disconnect with some of those other brands
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:16.120]  And I think that's probably why some of them are failing is because they make certain night, you know, they're good at the marketing
[01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:18.720]  They're good at getting the brand out there
[01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:25.080]  But if someone uses your soil and then never wants to use it again, I promise you they're gonna tell their homies about that
[01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:29.000]  Because they want to kind of let them know hey, you know, you can choose to use this
[01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.940]  But I used it or it's the other way around where you run out of gas
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:39.360]  So you spend all this money on a you know, a high-end engine and it doesn't even you know last you a hundred thousand miles
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:42.360]  There's there's something to be said about that as well
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:46.720]  So they can go a lot of you know, there's almost too many variables to kind of
[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:49.320]  Nitpick what could go wrong?
[01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:55.000]  So that's why doing your homework staying on top of things is paramount to find success
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:59.640]  Whether you're growing in the tent or whether somebody's letting you run an entire facility
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:02.400]  true that
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:08.180]  All right, so I was kind of gonna allow people to kind of open it up to questions
[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:11.520]  I was hoping that there was gonna be a lot of questions for this one
[01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:14.880]  and then we can kind of tie back in and finish out and
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:18.320]  I was hoping maybe him to pick your brain a little bit more on how
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:23.760]  People can find ways with IPM because I know that you see so many of these larger grows
[01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:29.000]  You know Marco and I've been talking with some specialists that understand that stuff
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.480]  but I'd like to see it from your side of things as a
[01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:36.080]  Soil producer because I think that's where a lot of those things are coming from
[01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:40.160]  Absolutely. So Ken if we have those questions, I
[01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:48.760]  Guess I should have looked before did we watch the whole video? I didn't care. Yeah, we did nice. Well, we've got 11 questions
[01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:53.400]  That are standing in the back. We'll try to keep an eye on what is new coming in
[01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:58.280]  Then we were talking about wood chips earlier, and I think you were talking about
[01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:01.440]  the nitrogen
[02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:08.000]  Fixation of the wood chips if you bury them or something like that. Does this apply with wood chips?
[02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:12.480]  Are you talking about the nitrogen lockout I believe so
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:13.080]  Yeah
[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:19.480]  and and certainly anytime you have a large amount of carbon you can run into this and I feel like nitrogen lockout is a bit
[02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:20.720]  Of a misnomer
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:27.560]  What's really happening is the soil biology mostly bacteria is like hey, we got a bunch of carbon
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:34.160]  I know what I need to process this. This is that's nitrogen and so it's gonna steal it from your plants
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:37.040]  it's gonna take all the available nitrogen in the soil and
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:43.600]  And and you're gonna obviously have all the signs and symptoms of nitrogen deficiency
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:48.400]  So you just have to be really careful to be amending in the right ratios
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:52.160]  some some type of nitrogen and of course
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:57.720]  I'm a promote proponent of amino nitrogen not nitrate nitrogen and
[02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:01.600]  And so yeah, that'll happen with wood chips as well
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:07.800]  If you're not amending some other nitrogen source, and it's one of the reasons I love hugel culture and hugel mounds
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:13.400]  If you guys are familiar with those with like logs in the middle and then sticks and all that
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:17.400]  But I I often see as that wood decomposes
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:24.200]  Nitrogen deficiency symptoms in hugel mounds and so in the same way if you layer in like a
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:28.920]  some sort of either feather meal bone meal blood meal
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:32.720]  You can do it with alfalfa meal, but it's kind of tough
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:39.320]  If you're really trying to do it vegan you'd maybe use bean meal or something like that like a soybean meal or a
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:44.800]  Our amino pro product is a cracked peas are good to pinto peas
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:48.400]  All that so
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:53.880]  So any any nitrogen like that's gonna gonna avoid that nitrogen lockout
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:59.480]  Which is really just nitrogen deficiency because it's been stolen by bacterial organisms
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:05.400]  Well they do need it to build their cell structure as well, so that's it
[02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:09.720]  Okay, so how about
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:16.960]  Hydro system keeping the PPM under 100 parts that affect the microbes and everything else
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:22.400]  Hmm well I mean hydro stuff's kind of crazy
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:27.480]  And I don't run into too many people trying to do
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:31.240]  A
[02:02:31.240 --> 02:02:33.240]  Organic hydro it happens
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:38.280]  And you can do it, but you're you're gonna be way better off trying to work in soil
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:42.560]  Do you guys have any thoughts on what they're asking there? I agree with that yeah
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:47.840]  I there's definitely um you know that people are finding six some people are finding success that way
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:54.300]  But I think if you're thinking long term. There's just gonna be too many pest pressures with that
[02:02:54.940 --> 02:03:00.500]  When you're comparing that against building an actual soil system the stomach if you will of the plant
[02:03:03.060 --> 02:03:05.060]  It's almost like to me it's like a
[02:03:06.300 --> 02:03:07.740]  Cheating the system a little bit
[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:13.340]  I mean it's not cheating, but you know it's it's feeding it with like an IV drip instead of being digested
[02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:15.660]  And you had mentioned like different
[02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:21.100]  Nitrogens that's being broken down all that stuff really matters when you're really trying to build that diversity
[02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:28.420]  And I don't I don't personally think that you're going to achieve that or there's very few people that are going to be able to
[02:03:28.420 --> 02:03:30.060]  achieve
[02:03:30.060 --> 02:03:32.340]  success especially perpetual success
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:35.220]  Using that method not saying it can't be done
[02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:39.980]  But you're gonna really have to have one hell of a skill set to really keep
[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:45.900]  You know keep the flips keep the plants healthy where if you're newer to this you're just basically
[02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:51.740]  Relying on mother nature, and you're maybe you know making a few adjustments here and there
[02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:53.740]  But you're kind of staying out of the process
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:58.620]  And that's I think what we're really trying to teach everyone is mother nature figured this out
[02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:01.940]  She's got it so the less that we interfere
[02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:08.500]  I think especially at the beginning when you're getting into this the more success you're gonna find instead of fucking up flip after flip
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:14.940]  Paying bills and not having any money when you're supposed to be you know you're dreaming of fast cars and all that stuff
[02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:19.340]  And you can't even have you don't have any money to pay Excel because you had two bad flips in a row
[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:23.620]  That's a kick in the teeth that I hope none of you ever experience
[02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:30.620]  And the wife just came down and told me it wasn't hydro. It was hybrid. Yeah hybrid
[02:04:31.380 --> 02:04:36.260]  But I think that's what they're talking about is a hybrid hydro system, so
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:43.540]  Yeah, just using microbes, but still having those synthetic salts, and I think Layton's gone into you know
[02:04:43.540 --> 02:04:45.300]  There's probably 10
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:48.100]  15 different episodes where he's discussed those kind of things
[02:04:48.580 --> 02:04:54.940]  And it kind of is a catch-22 as things start to build up, then you're adding those salts things died back down
[02:04:55.820 --> 02:05:02.660]  Again the Debo seem to emerge so the diversity is not going to be there unless you're really on top of it and again
[02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:05.140]  That's a skill set that you have to achieve
[02:05:05.300 --> 02:05:07.180]  You're not gonna be able to
[02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:11.960]  Most people aren't gonna be able to read a few books and just be able to find success that way
[02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:18.280]  That's it you're working against you so easy. You know that's the thing is I want that system to work for me, right?
[02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:21.920]  I got other stuff to do
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:26.800]  There's more projects. There's more experiments. Yeah, what you kind of had that going
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:33.640]  Yeah, you're trusting the process and you're realizing that especially today man driving and seeing the mountains
[02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:37.240]  It's figured out. There's not there's you are
[02:05:38.200 --> 02:05:40.540]  but there's no huge diversity when
[02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:43.960]  Man isn't interfering
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:47.760]  And I think that's something in the back of your head that I think a lot of you newer farmers
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:50.920]  Especially ones that want to get into it for next year kind of learning this year
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:52.400]  I
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:57.760]  Would trust mother nature over over you and I know sometimes the ego that's it's kind of hard
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:05:59.560]  But yeah, she's got it
[02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:06.480]  And if you can just tap into that and improve on those things you're gonna be miles ahead of someone that that really thinks that they're
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:12.400]  Mix the the perfect pH and have the perfect PPM every single time and
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:17.640]  Here's the caveat with that or tell someone else to be able to achieve that
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.640]  You know if they're having a team, it's very
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:26.320]  It's very hard to find individuals where you say like hey do this
[02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:30.940]  ABC and they hear you and follow that ABC
[02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:36.980]  You know that takes time and again if there's high turnover you have to go through that shit every other month or two
[02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:39.860]  You're not gonna grow good canvas. No, that's it
[02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:44.020]  and I think you've really hit the nail on the head with the like ego and
[02:06:44.460 --> 02:06:49.900]  and I think that's where all these things like hydro and you know, I've done it and and
[02:06:50.220 --> 02:06:54.460]  We're like biochar and we just always think there's some other
[02:06:54.980 --> 02:06:58.700]  Super duper tech magic human II thing that we're gonna cook up
[02:06:59.020 --> 02:07:05.580]  That this is the silver bullet that digs us out and really the silver bullet is just looking in that forest floor
[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:09.820]  At all those silver bullets that are laying there. There's a trillion of them
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:13.920]  You just have to be what willing to willing to look so agreed
[02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:17.820]  Yeah
[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:20.100]  Okay, so the next one
[02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:28.220]  Is it tied up in bacteria I think we were that was when we were talking about the different nutrients being tied up
[02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:33.700]  Hey family, let's work on some complete sentences out there, you know, like
[02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:44.740]  Yeah is what tied up in bacteria pride nitrogen I'm guess I was yeah
[02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:47.380]  So it's back in that time when we were talking at the beginning
[02:07:48.380 --> 02:07:50.980]  Okay, cuz then there was all the potassium
[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:53.500]  stuff to you know
[02:07:53.500 --> 02:08:00.380]  the overabundance of potassium and as in was one thing and then there's yeah the nitrogen lockout which is
[02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:05.020]  consumed by bacteria if you don't have enough nitrogen in too much carbon and
[02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:13.260]  I guess the flip side of that's if you have too much nitrogen the microbe the bacterial organisms spend it as ammonia gas
[02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:20.380]  So that's why raw chicken litter smells the way it does that's kind of an interesting little tidbit
[02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:28.420]  That's ammonia
[02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:36.180]  That's it we were talking about how to get
[02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:41.500]  Really bad soils you're talking about a sports field and somebody went in the desert
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:43.500]  So can this be done in a desert?
[02:08:44.740 --> 02:08:48.940]  Using your methodology and your products to bring a desert back to green
[02:08:49.740 --> 02:08:54.900]  Absolutely. Yeah, and we see it out here like at the the conference in Delta
[02:08:55.940 --> 02:08:59.580]  Two years ago one of our resellers Jackson's living soil
[02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:05.300]  They gave we give away a ton of samples. The old guy took some of our longevity mix
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:07.340]  and
[02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:13.340]  He'd been trying for 30 years to grow a lawn literally in probably one of the hottest driest deserts in
[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:16.380]  Colorado could never make it happen and
[02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:23.380]  Put this out and there was a four square patch of perfect green lawn in this desert ecosystem
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:29.980]  And and to me the most, you know, there are a bunch of factors it takes the minerals that takes the pH
[02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:32.380]  but it also
[02:09:32.580 --> 02:09:33.780]  takes
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:38.060]  the organic matter and that's where all the water holding capability of
[02:09:38.580 --> 02:09:41.420]  The soil is is in that organic matter
[02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:48.540]  And so, you know if you can go from one to two three hundred percent you go from two to four
[02:09:48.820 --> 02:09:56.500]  That's another three hundred percent water holding capability go from four to eight another three hundred percent water holding
[02:09:56.700 --> 02:10:00.460]  Capability in a dry world. Why wouldn't you take advantage of that?
[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:07.140]  And why would you just keep burning organic matter out of your soil and your lawn yet when you drive through Kansas or Texas
[02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:12.300]  And you see those thousands of rows of corn that is literally what they're doing there
[02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:19.620]  they're doing hydro in the top six inches of sand and just pumping, you know ammonium nitrate or
[02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:25.340]  Anhydrous ammonia something like that for their nitrogen component into that
[02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:30.780]  Hydro and they've got a six inch tillage pan. So the roots hit the hard clay they stop
[02:10:31.100 --> 02:10:34.020]  they're doing hydro and six inches of sand and
[02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:39.380]  Calling it agriculture and I think it's insane and I think we need to get away from that
[02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:44.540]  And a good organic farm you can plunge your arm into your elbow because of the organic matter
[02:10:45.580 --> 02:10:47.580]  Yeah, it just slides right in
[02:10:48.460 --> 02:10:54.900]  Exactly. So yeah, that's kind of where we're like weird with our lawn mix. We have organic matter in the lawn mix
[02:10:55.900 --> 02:11:01.780]  We have all the 22 other ingredients. We've got calcium magnesium trace minerals
[02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:07.940]  But we do have a lot of nitrogen in their lawns love nitrogen and that's all amino based nitrogen
[02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:12.420]  Nice do you so I guess you do orders you do like
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:20.620]  Would you ever do like construction where new construction now landscaping comes in we need six inch of topsoil or whatever you into that kind of?
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:24.940]  Yeah, like the Denver Federal Buildings landscape is in our stuff
[02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:30.220]  That's Brian was saying Cherry Creek mall their flower beds and all that or in such
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:36.580]  It's I mean Cherry Creek has got it has to be perfect and that shit is beautiful, man
[02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:42.020]  Yeah, so we do a lot of that and so like prior favorite for perennials
[02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:44.820]  It's really important with our mixes to understand
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:51.020]  They're kind of like low medium and high and our featherweight champion is our low mix and we use that for
[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:54.540]  House plants, you know house plants are low feeders
[02:11:54.540 --> 02:12:00.740]  They're they were selected because of that so that you can kind of forget about them and they'll survive one way or the other
[02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:05.900]  You put house plants in the bomb. They're gonna croak and die in five days
[02:12:06.820 --> 02:12:11.900]  But featherweight works great for that and it works great for trees and shrubs native
[02:12:13.180 --> 02:12:17.020]  Native perennials all those types of things are low feeding plants
[02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:20.580]  And then the cut flower mix is kind of the mid strength
[02:12:21.420 --> 02:12:24.220]  That's all the bulbs and this is bulb time of year
[02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:29.540]  you want to treat your wife get her a bag of cut flower mix and plant a bunch of bulbs with her and
[02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:32.580]  Next spring that'll pay huge huge dividends
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:40.460]  you'll have some awesome stuff happening and then the high feeder mixes come into play the bomb raised bed mix and
[02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:44.540]  Some people use those in landscaping, but not as much
[02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:53.060]  They're really for planting veggies in or hemp or any type of cannabis and
[02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:56.340]  They're a very potent mix
[02:12:57.060 --> 02:13:01.060]  So it's what's cool about all brick though. If you once you get that
[02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:07.140]  Yeah, the the nitrogen you need to adjust it a little but in general as long as you're in ratio
[02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:10.780]  You can cover a whole wide range of plants
[02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:17.800]  And so that's what we're doing there is and why we've got those kind of specific blends in that way
[02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:24.220]  Well, that's really good because a lot of people need to make their wife really happy, you know
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:26.700]  And that makes the wife happy nice flowers, you know
[02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:31.220]  The game
[02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:33.260]  Now
[02:13:33.260 --> 02:13:37.860]  Can discarded mash and grains from a distillery be used?
[02:13:38.620 --> 02:13:40.620]  In your compost style system
[02:13:41.540 --> 02:13:49.100]  Absolutely. Yeah, I've seen a lot of people use it successfully. I just don't have access to any of that in a large enough quantity
[02:13:49.100 --> 02:13:51.260]  That's the thing when you need, you know
[02:13:52.180 --> 02:13:59.180]  Semi after semi after semi you really have to this becomes part of your thinking. What can we get on a consistent?
[02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:04.860]  scalable long-term basis, but on a small basis grains are great and
[02:14:05.380 --> 02:14:11.540]  Make a really great compost feedstock and just once again check your carbon to nitrogen ratio
[02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:19.540]  But really compost is is so simple. There's only four things you need to make a great compost and it's air water
[02:14:20.740 --> 02:14:22.740]  the feedstock and
[02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:29.820]  Carbon and you you've got all those things nitrogen carbon air and water you can make great compost
[02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:36.140]  And some of the guys oh, sorry, go ahead Marco not at all just when I when somebody's not
[02:14:36.660 --> 02:14:42.460]  Able to make their compost go it's one. It's usually water, but it's one of those four things that's missing
[02:14:42.460 --> 02:14:48.660]  And so just squeeze it until the the water barely drips out but not past that
[02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:54.840]  You won't go anaerobic there and you'll have plenty of water to get done what you're trying to do
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:56.840]  Usually
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:14:58.840]  Usually over water
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:04.280]  Then it goes anaerobic smells horrible all that
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:12.240]  Yeah nightmare. So a couple of guys are asking different components dolomite lime and
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:14.540]  insect frass
[02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:17.920]  Yeah, we use a lot of dolomite dolomites great. It's
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:21.280]  By itself overly high in magnesium
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:22.760]  Magnesium
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:29.200]  But it's a great component for that. And as long as you have some other calciums you're working to keep
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:34.840]  Everything in ratio with dolomites great insect frass is cool, but I haven't
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:40.000]  Gotten the mega results out of it that I had kind of hoped at one time
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:44.920]  and that's the thing that happens to me a lot because I have all the biology and
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:51.000]  I've got a lot of organic matter like a lot of other methods that might win because they
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:57.200]  increase those things we've already got them so we don't see this big increase and
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:02.320]  insect brass is one of those that I I just haven't been able to get a
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:09.000]  concrete gain in my output on top of the other things that I'm already doing I
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:12.200]  Certainly think that if you've got like a dead field or
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:19.920]  Something out of whack and that insect for us that you're using has those elements in it. It can be super beneficial for sure. No doubt
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:26.840]  But so I'm not against insect brass and it's it's once again. It's kind of like our compost
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:31.840]  It's kind of like can F what we're doing here is we're we're looking at ways that nature
[02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.640]  bioconverts minerals and elements and
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:38.440]  they
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:45.520]  Insects insects are pretty powerful at doing that at taking one type of material and turning it into another. I
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:52.200]  Think insect brass is great to kind of just build up that diversity to add a little bit a little bit of protein
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:54.440]  And you've heard me talk about the chitin from it
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:57.760]  So if you're if you're really trying to build your decomposers
[02:16:57.760 --> 02:17:03.680]  I think that's where you're really going to to find success and I'm using that obviously to build up every one of mine
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:06.920]  And then I've I've also seen a
[02:17:07.480 --> 02:17:13.240]  Dramatic difference from going from the cricket to the black soldier fly, which obviously I learned from Marco
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:18.640]  So I think the quality of some of the stuff that you're using when you're talking for us that matters as well
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:24.000]  And if you're using cricket, that's the baloney man, and we don't eat baloney sandwiches around here for sure
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.360]  I probably need to come back and try some of your for us
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:32.320]  Definitely black soldier fly some good stuff, man. Nice
[02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:40.560]  Well, you're also getting all the components the in insect needs to rebuild another insect is like feeding plants plants
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:44.840]  Feed the insects you want to grow the insects and the components they need to grow
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:51.620]  And I don't know if this is I think it's true and I think there's some writings on it
[02:17:51.620 --> 02:17:59.400]  But just a component of insects frass plant relationship meaning now is plant getting a little stress or thinking
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:06.080]  Insects are attacking. Let me beef up. You know, it's my opinion that I think that is true. What do you think mark?
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:14.040]  Yeah, well I you know, once again insect frass isn't a place I've put much of my in-depth research
[02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:16.520]  but I've
[02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:18.520]  I've definitely seen
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:26.520]  Amazing things with with bugs bio converting things and I think this is it to me one of the coolest things I ever saw
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:34.200]  was a tote of some feather meal that got wet and the flies got into it and they they
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:43.440]  Made this this output that was completely different from what we started with and because they were trapped in there yet had food and water
[02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:45.200]  they could
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:49.600]  Grow on and we filled basically a yard bag full of flies
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:53.140]  And so it's even a whole different thing than the frass in a way
[02:18:53.140 --> 02:18:58.620]  it's like the flies bodies, but it it it was amazing stuff like I
[02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:04.620]  trialed that and yeah, so I'm I think there's a whole world in
[02:19:07.020 --> 02:19:09.020]  Basically entomological
[02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:13.780]  Bioconversion that holds a ton of promise and I wish I knew more about it
[02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:17.260]  And it's it's an area that I'm planning on studying frankly, so
[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:21.100]  Good
[02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:25.820]  Right there that is the next you know, tell me the next frontier, you know
[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:33.580]  Going deeper using different specific insects or different specific biology just kind of do specific things
[02:19:33.580 --> 02:19:37.020]  I think that's we got a lot of a lot to learn about that and
[02:19:37.820 --> 02:19:41.900]  Yeah, man, black soldier fly. Usually a lot of people say in Colorado
[02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:48.420]  They won't populate but you know all on the East Coast. They will if you put out a band with some they populate my basement
[02:19:48.420 --> 02:19:50.020]  dude, oh
[02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:54.840]  Now did you get him hatching out of there? Hell? Yeah, man, my wife came down what the hell
[02:19:56.140 --> 02:19:58.140]  so we're experimenting baby and
[02:19:58.780 --> 02:20:00.780]  Just got out of hand a little bit
[02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:07.860]  Here's what I wanted to see from you is now throw those in with the with the bearded and now maybe you're getting that
[02:20:07.980 --> 02:20:09.980]  hatching eating that flying
[02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:17.860]  Yeah, I definitely threw him in there and when they a lot of them were dead and I just threw him in there
[02:20:17.860 --> 02:20:21.840]  So the isopods that were in his tank they were eating on that
[02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:25.220]  I started to throw a little bit of the grass seeds some different seeds
[02:20:25.220 --> 02:20:30.160]  So now that there's actually like things growing out of that he can eat the grass in real time
[02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:34.600]  Which seems like you know, it's taking it to the next level because I'm feeding that calcium
[02:20:34.600 --> 02:20:39.140]  So the grass is growing through that and then it's like another little hiding, you know
[02:20:39.420 --> 02:20:45.180]  It's almost like a world upon worlds when the grass is growing because everybody can hide and feel safe
[02:20:45.260 --> 02:20:47.260]  So that allows the beard you to
[02:20:47.460 --> 02:20:54.460]  Like really take his hunting to the next level and I think if you're going to use a beardy as some part of your IPM
[02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:55.580]  protocols
[02:20:55.580 --> 02:21:02.320]  You know take the extra steps to build him a living soil a bioactive tank, whatever you want to call it
[02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:07.660]  But make sure that it's kind of a closed-loop system and you'll see you can see it on the animals face
[02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:09.620]  It's just he just perks up man
[02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:14.460]  Life life is so much better when they can hunt if they if they only eat something that's alive
[02:21:14.460 --> 02:21:17.820]  And that's what a bearded dragon. They won't eat eat anything. That is
[02:21:18.460 --> 02:21:20.060]  deceased
[02:21:20.060 --> 02:21:23.420]  Yeah, you feel bad for some of those enclosed, you know animals
[02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:28.940]  They feed them with like pincers like every time like you're just eating a worm on a pair of tweezers
[02:21:28.940 --> 02:21:35.340]  Like, you know, yeah, we're all about that giving them that whole life giving them that whole experience and that's you know
[02:21:35.340 --> 02:21:40.420]  It's just gonna be better for him and just just a better mindset, you know when you think like that
[02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:45.740]  And that's your ace in the back pocket man, if so if there is a breakout or all the sudden holy shit
[02:21:45.740 --> 02:21:51.200]  There's black soldier fly everywhere. Yeah, let let a bearded dragon a couple hours and that shit will be gone
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:55.940]  I promise they can even like puff out their stomachs and it looks like they can continue to eat
[02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:59.380]  Same way I try to do on Thanksgiving, you know, just keep it going
[02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:06.340]  But they're they're able to really eradicate things and chickens do the same thing for outdoor farmers
[02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:10.380]  Indoor I would go obviously with a beardy outdoor chickens
[02:22:10.380 --> 02:22:15.460]  I think there's a lot of joy and even kind of raising chickens healthy chickens again
[02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:18.640]  You're gonna want to you know, do some research on the species
[02:22:19.020 --> 02:22:25.300]  But yes, some of those higher end ones that Jethouse and a few others were talking about I've done a some research on those
[02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:31.020]  I definitely want to dive in when I get to the ranch and those kind of things, but I do think you'll find joy in
[02:22:31.700 --> 02:22:33.700]  Maybe animals you thought were kind of stupid
[02:22:34.220 --> 02:22:41.460]  You might realize that they're actually hugely beneficial and killing grasshoppers and like things that are so annoying chickens just
[02:22:41.860 --> 02:22:47.960]  Tear tear us if you grow cannabis to you know, they're good to have around they eat caterpillars eight bugs
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:50.560]  They just they're just all around good. Yeah
[02:22:51.740 --> 02:22:57.880]  Yeah, at least in Colorado, man. That's what everybody's dealing with. It's crazy out here. And yeah my place
[02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:02.460]  has a lot of mantis on it and the mantis really have done a good job at
[02:23:03.220 --> 02:23:06.680]  It kind of being the defender against these big gnarly grasshoppers
[02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:09.380]  Well, you might as well said I got ninjas
[02:23:10.660 --> 02:23:14.420]  Property because that's what those things are. They are they are
[02:23:15.020 --> 02:23:20.500]  Yeah, when we were filming that video yesterday, there was one on the soil line trying to fight the totes coming out of the mixer
[02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:24.540]  Like sorry little buddy move out the way I
[02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:29.860]  Think you got to get a screen door on the inside of the house Brian going into the basement
[02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:31.860]  And then the wife won't ever see them, right?
[02:23:33.140 --> 02:23:35.140]  I don't care
[02:23:35.780 --> 02:23:40.580]  It was like a six-hour problem, but but yeah, that's what I'm saying be able to have those
[02:23:41.460 --> 02:23:46.580]  Methods or know how to solve those issues and to be honest since I've been using the black soldier
[02:23:46.820 --> 02:23:54.060]  Larvae like the Japanese magic potion some of the ones that really it's hard for my competition to get that coloring to come out
[02:23:54.060 --> 02:23:56.060]  I think it's the kite. I
[02:23:56.140 --> 02:23:57.740]  You know, I don't have any yeah
[02:23:57.740 --> 02:24:02.500]  But I think that is part of my success and like crab meal and again different sources
[02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:07.540]  But the insect brass crab meals those kind of things are taking it to the next level
[02:24:07.540 --> 02:24:09.860]  So if you're just trying to build up your worm farm
[02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:17.500]  Using isopods and worms worms love the the grit of the crab meal the eggshells all that is a symbiotic
[02:24:18.100 --> 02:24:21.140]  Force to be reckoned with once it once it really starts to pop off
[02:24:22.140 --> 02:24:29.340]  You always need all of the nutrients and all of the building components for the animals for the plants and for us
[02:24:29.420 --> 02:24:31.220]  If you don't have them
[02:24:31.220 --> 02:24:36.840]  You found out yourself. You don't have those vibrant colors. And now that you've added them in now, you've got that
[02:24:37.780 --> 02:24:43.620]  That was kind of a gold bar to Brian because like you're almost got into where you tailor your own worm
[02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:48.020]  Castings in a custom way, you know, because if you think about you build a worm bin
[02:24:48.420 --> 02:24:52.780]  The only thing that they get is what you put in it so on a small scale home
[02:24:53.180 --> 02:24:59.580]  Grower, you know build a worm bin only throw specific things in this bin and see what you get
[02:24:59.580 --> 02:25:03.340]  Don't do another bin only throw, you know different types of inputs, you know
[02:25:03.340 --> 02:25:06.140]  Rock dust and one and leafy and another, you know
[02:25:06.140 --> 02:25:10.140]  Just kind of mix it up and I think you just build that diversity even more
[02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:16.260]  Yeah, and if you're new to this I wouldn't use the scraps the food scraps how they're telling you
[02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:21.940]  I think it would be more like kind of what Bart was saying where you maybe just use like plant material
[02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:26.740]  And figure it out cardboard those kind of things if you are adding a lot of greens
[02:25:26.740 --> 02:25:31.260]  I found more success when I add just a little bit of the Browns just to mix them up
[02:25:31.260 --> 02:25:34.780]  I would like put it through a shredder. You can get it Office Depot
[02:25:35.300 --> 02:25:41.420]  Because I found more success when I added greens just a little bit of Brown seemed to kind of soak up any little extras
[02:25:41.420 --> 02:25:44.180]  And I was obviously making a lot of mistakes back then
[02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:49.980]  That was a long time ago to be honest, but to really build up the the vermicomposting bins
[02:25:51.260 --> 02:25:57.540]  I've never seen anybody fail at that other than maybe they forgot the water, you know, I mean those are
[02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:02.100]  Too much food
[02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:05.100]  And that usually just comes from when they're doing like the food scraps
[02:26:05.100 --> 02:26:10.620]  So if you just kind of stay focused you're adding amendments and not adding your constant food from your family
[02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:14.820]  and then in time you can obviously do composting in that way, but
[02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:19.680]  Most people when they get into compost they're into it for a few weeks. They kind of forget about it
[02:26:20.180 --> 02:26:24.060]  And then you got fungus gnats through the roof or something. So I don't want you guys to fail
[02:26:24.060 --> 02:26:27.700]  I don't want your wife or your husband to you know
[02:26:28.420 --> 02:26:32.120]  Because fungus gnats man when they are taking off our white flies the rips
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:37.820]  I mean that it almost looks like a horror film when you pop open that tent and you don't really know what you're doing yet
[02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:43.900]  They fly out at you they fly in your mouth you will never forget that I promise you if you open up a tent
[02:26:44.700 --> 02:26:50.020]  They fly in your mouth. So to minimize that stuff you have to be on point and
[02:26:50.780 --> 02:26:56.220]  IPM and all of those things and not wasting money on some of the predatories here in Colorado
[02:26:56.300 --> 02:27:00.700]  That probably are effective for Marco aren't going to be effective for Barton
[02:27:00.700 --> 02:27:04.620]  I so you got to understand that kind of stuff because humidity plays a huge role
[02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:09.180]  Especially relative humidity plays a huge role when you're talking predatory mice
[02:27:10.620 --> 02:27:14.300]  For sure get back to some questions guys
[02:27:15.620 --> 02:27:20.340]  Well, that's why we took an hour. We got an hour because I figured these would go deeper. Yeah
[02:27:21.060 --> 02:27:22.420]  so
[02:27:22.420 --> 02:27:29.100]  JDN Canadian was wondering if he's tarps or burlap to cover your piles at all
[02:27:29.980 --> 02:27:32.900]  Yeah, when we are gonna tarp them we do use
[02:27:33.900 --> 02:27:35.740]  Some poly tarps
[02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:37.620]  but a
[02:27:37.620 --> 02:27:43.020]  Lot of the time we like to leave our piles open and the moisture in the winter, you know
[02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:46.660]  We've got our big ditch. We've got a half million gallons a day of ditch water
[02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:49.660]  And a big old pump. What is
[02:27:50.460 --> 02:27:52.900]  What was that old game with the gravity gun?
[02:27:53.580 --> 02:27:57.700]  Like fallout or something. My buddy says our pump looks like it came from fallout
[02:27:58.220 --> 02:28:04.860]  It's like a 70s big 6 inch 70s pump with a big gas engine on it and
[02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:13.060]  We'll do that all the way through till the ditch is shut off and then it starts snowing and
[02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:18.660]  That takes over the water for the winter and in keeping that kind of outside layer moist
[02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:23.660]  So I really like kind of not tarping my piles really mostly
[02:28:24.020 --> 02:28:29.740]  You could use burlap but you're you're not gonna stop anything from going through that obviously and
[02:28:31.260 --> 02:28:33.820]  The biology is just gonna eat it
[02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:37.220]  It's it's the same thing as like a wood raised bed or something like that
[02:28:37.220 --> 02:28:42.860]  Somebody's like I'll make a wood raised bed and like the next season all the woods gone. They're like, where'd it go?
[02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:44.260]  and
[02:28:44.260 --> 02:28:50.180]  And so you got to kind of pay attention to the materials that your biology is gonna gonna decompose
[02:28:50.180 --> 02:28:52.900]  So I think burlap would be pretty hard to get any usable
[02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:56.340]  Element out of the finished compost here
[02:28:56.340 --> 02:29:00.820]  We like to tarp it just to keep any if any weed seeds blew over anything like that
[02:29:00.820 --> 02:29:07.900]  We really like to keep that under wraps like that, but the hot compost no, I like it out out in the elements myself
[02:29:08.340 --> 02:29:14.500]  Is that ditch just are you guys kind of plateaued and is that brown water just coming through or what?
[02:29:15.900 --> 02:29:19.300]  It's Rocky Mountain basically runoff and spring water
[02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:22.720]  Okay, where we are up here we're kind of at the
[02:29:23.660 --> 02:29:26.740]  Really the headwaters of the of the Colorado
[02:29:27.900 --> 02:29:29.620]  and so
[02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:31.620]  it's an old decree and
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:36.900]  This valley is really unique in its kind of gravity based irrigation
[02:29:37.340 --> 02:29:41.220]  System was around the turn of the century was put in their old decrees
[02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:44.700]  And we're really blessed to have enough
[02:29:45.420 --> 02:29:47.180]  enough water
[02:29:47.180 --> 02:29:53.900]  To do what we need to do which which not everybody does and so it's kind of one of the nice things about living here
[02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:59.260]  that and and of course not every their dry properties in the valley and things like that, but
[02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:01.580]  When you've got the right ditch
[02:30:01.580 --> 02:30:07.660]  These are old old ditches and they come come from the river and the river comes from
[02:30:08.060 --> 02:30:11.700]  streams higher up and you know areas like
[02:30:12.220 --> 02:30:14.500]  you know anthracite Creek and
[02:30:15.180 --> 02:30:17.100]  the West Muddy
[02:30:17.380 --> 02:30:19.380]  so like Grand Mesa
[02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:27.180]  The elk mountains things like that are where all of our water comes from is that gold territory or gem territory?
[02:30:27.180 --> 02:30:29.340]  I know they do a lot of gold and gems out there
[02:30:29.580 --> 02:30:35.900]  Yeah, there's certainly all of those things in places around here. You know old mines are somewhat common
[02:30:36.820 --> 02:30:37.940]  and
[02:30:37.940 --> 02:30:45.260]  And I've had friends find gems up on the on the Grand Mesa certainly in certain places
[02:30:46.260 --> 02:30:51.660]  Maybe not quite as much as some of the stuff over by Salida and whatnot
[02:30:53.340 --> 02:31:00.140]  But but there's a little bit of that stuff out here for sure and that's pretty cool when I drove through Colorado
[02:31:00.140 --> 02:31:04.700]  It's so wild because you just look up in the mountains and there's a black hole like a little spot up there
[02:31:04.700 --> 02:31:06.700]  You know, that's old gold
[02:31:06.700 --> 02:31:08.700]  Dotted up in the hills
[02:31:09.020 --> 02:31:10.540]  It's pretty wild
[02:31:10.540 --> 02:31:16.620]  It's crazy. Then the only gold mine work is by like Pikes Peak. Well, there's that whole
[02:31:17.100 --> 02:31:22.060]  The whole thing there in the cripple Creek area. I can't remember the name of that company
[02:31:22.060 --> 02:31:26.500]  but yeah, they were still pulling millions and millions and gold out of those mines and
[02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:29.020]  I remember going up there as a kid
[02:31:29.020 --> 02:31:35.060]  I grew up in Colorado Springs and there was an abandoned gold mine up on Cheyenne Mountain like
[02:31:36.060 --> 02:31:41.380]  Probably four blocks from my house you could walk to it and and at that time it wasn't even you know
[02:31:41.380 --> 02:31:45.020]  Graded over like all the parents. Oh, well, don't fall in the gold mine, you know
[02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:51.060]  but yeah, they're sketch and it's just crazy thinking about those people at the turn of the century like
[02:31:51.900 --> 02:31:57.460]  battling it out to blast and drill and and dig their way down into the earth to find
[02:31:58.180 --> 02:32:00.180]  Find these resources
[02:32:00.500 --> 02:32:02.500]  That's it
[02:32:02.980 --> 02:32:08.340]  So for all of your mixes, can you say which one best fits growing cannabis?
[02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:12.100]  yeah, either either the bomb 50-50 or
[02:32:12.740 --> 02:32:14.340]  raised bed mix
[02:32:14.340 --> 02:32:18.700]  Just depending on whether you like the pearlite or not or you want to go rice holes
[02:32:19.060 --> 02:32:23.740]  But those are the two the two mixes oriented in that direction
[02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:29.580]  And then the big one is is there a Brian and Marco discount code?
[02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:31.740]  Hey, what's up, Matt?
[02:32:34.100 --> 02:32:36.500]  I'm sure we can figure something out. I
[02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:45.700]  Would say pig in his brain before you bought that'd be worth worth discount code right there gave us the discount code people
[02:32:50.620 --> 02:32:55.020]  Mice to use and stuff cuz I know I've wasted probably in the thousands
[02:32:55.300 --> 02:33:00.180]  Buying the wrong mites and buying ladybugs that fell down and didn't do anything
[02:33:00.940 --> 02:33:02.940]  and there's there's a lot of
[02:33:02.980 --> 02:33:05.820]  trial and error when you were doing this without being able to
[02:33:06.620 --> 02:33:08.180]  Confidently get on the internet
[02:33:08.180 --> 02:33:13.180]  I mean there were times you could get on somebody or VPN you could get on and try to figure some stuff out
[02:33:13.180 --> 02:33:15.180]  But it wasn't the same way
[02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:21.420]  I would say what in the last like three years four years maybe or it seems like a lot of people especially after Kobe
[02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:22.980]  So that's only what two years
[02:33:22.980 --> 02:33:28.620]  Where a lot of the faces are now coming out and talking about this stuff where beforehand?
[02:33:28.620 --> 02:33:33.780]  It was on the forums like we talked about two weeks ago. You know, it was practically I see mag
[02:33:34.500 --> 02:33:36.500]  overgrow and then trying to
[02:33:37.180 --> 02:33:44.200]  You know build up the courage to Google, you know how to grow cannabis, you know, and I think before we
[02:33:45.220 --> 02:33:50.500]  Realize that we're small fish in this stuff, you know, it was kind of terrifying to even Google that
[02:33:51.500 --> 02:33:55.940]  Well, it's like we used to get high times in the brown envelope, you know
[02:33:55.940 --> 02:34:00.460]  You're always we're waiting for that to come in the mail, but they couldn't send it out and anything
[02:34:00.460 --> 02:34:06.940]  But right because then be in trouble. That's it. I remember those days. That's where I figured out Cypress Hill came from
[02:34:09.180 --> 02:34:14.260]  I always thought it was silly too because you would always have to buy those right next to like the penthouses and stuff
[02:34:14.260 --> 02:34:19.380]  Yeah, so you're like man. Everybody thinks I'm over here. I'm just trying to buy my weed magazine
[02:34:20.100 --> 02:34:24.580]  Yeah, it was packaged in the same way, yeah, yeah, so crazy
[02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:30.340]  So what natural amendments do you add to maintain a lower pH?
[02:34:32.100 --> 02:34:34.220]  When I do I you know
[02:34:34.220 --> 02:34:40.140]  And that's an interesting question because a lot of like living soil people say oh you don't need to adjust your pH
[02:34:41.220 --> 02:34:47.140]  And in a lot of cases, that's true. The biology can help buffer pH a lot
[02:34:47.140 --> 02:34:49.660]  but I like citric acid and
[02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:55.500]  and when I need to use that is when I see pH is going above about like
[02:34:56.260 --> 02:34:58.140]  7 6 7 8
[02:34:58.140 --> 02:35:02.380]  And this is usually caused by alkaline water or other alkaloids
[02:35:03.700 --> 02:35:06.820]  either from minerals or added to the water and
[02:35:07.820 --> 02:35:09.820]  and at some point, you know
[02:35:11.620 --> 02:35:14.020]  Acidification is a power of hydrogen essentially
[02:35:15.020 --> 02:35:20.020]  Ponderous hydrogen I think is where pH came from if we're gonna bust some Latin on it, but
[02:35:21.860 --> 02:35:23.860]  Basically like
[02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:31.020]  You know, you're the more acidic once once you're below 7 you have excess hydrogen and
[02:35:32.740 --> 02:35:39.260]  If the alkaloids are stealing that hydrogen even if your acidic plant root exudates are
[02:35:39.820 --> 02:35:46.220]  Are trying to keep up at some point those alkaloids are essentially in a way going to just steal those hydrogen
[02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:50.580]  Ions and then your your plant can't ever get that toehold
[02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:54.620]  And so if it's if I'm if I'm rising above 7 8
[02:35:54.620 --> 02:35:58.060]  I like to knock it back down and a little bit of citric acid
[02:35:58.780 --> 02:36:00.780]  Microbially derived it's organic
[02:36:01.540 --> 02:36:08.740]  and and gentle and out here in western, Colorado where I've seen ditch water come in at pH 11 and
[02:36:09.260 --> 02:36:16.340]  You know their things are alkali and you'll see just like the old-timers will be like alkali flats or alkali
[02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:21.220]  Salts or whatever and they're right, but it's not necessarily sodium chloride. It's usually like
[02:36:21.900 --> 02:36:28.660]  Gypsum or something like that. It's a calcium salt and you'll just see it out in the Dobie clay desert and and
[02:36:29.340 --> 02:36:34.380]  and so that's why like people will have calcium deficiency, even though they've got
[02:36:35.220 --> 02:36:38.220]  5,000 or 8,000 ppm's of calcium in their soil
[02:36:38.700 --> 02:36:44.420]  Because that alkali has it all locked up and if you can get below that certain level, you know
[02:36:44.420 --> 02:36:52.300]  You don't get have to get to six five or five nine or whatever crazy things people do if you can just get below like
[02:36:53.020 --> 02:36:55.020]  7-4 or something like that
[02:36:55.140 --> 02:37:02.380]  Then the biology and the plant root exudates can really take off and keep that keep that set for you
[02:37:02.540 --> 02:37:05.980]  So I'll send people out with a fertilizer spreader
[02:37:06.660 --> 02:37:12.420]  Broadcast spreading granular citric acid out here and and the agronomist look at me like I'm insane
[02:37:12.420 --> 02:37:19.180]  But you see the result these people get just that like their next season will be so much better
[02:37:19.700 --> 02:37:23.580]  You just have to be careful like some people do that and it's so dry out
[02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:29.100]  And then all of a sudden it rains like a week later and it's the whole volcano
[02:37:29.700 --> 02:37:36.580]  Science experiment from third grade their yard just sizzles and pops and they freak out what's going on
[02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:38.580]  I don't know and
[02:37:39.100 --> 02:37:43.700]  and it's just that that hydrogen getting into your soil, so I
[02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:49.580]  Think it's a great thing and I really like citric acid and I like injection pumps
[02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:54.460]  I don't use a dosatron for newts. I use a dosatron for my citric acid
[02:37:55.500 --> 02:37:57.260]  Cool
[02:37:57.300 --> 02:38:05.340]  So Hawaiian sustainable looks like he wants to start building soil here he's wonders what you would recommend for equipment and
[02:38:06.820 --> 02:38:13.300]  Advance on come and any advice on compliance with regulations or any type tips on
[02:38:13.660 --> 02:38:19.940]  SOPs those pallet tracks look great love of the or love for the video
[02:38:20.540 --> 02:38:25.840]  Is outed I know I'm lost. Yep. I see it there that all looks great. Yeah
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:30.880]  Obviously palette palette rollers are a huge part of what we do here
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:35.080]  I've had to kind of in invent my systems
[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:40.320]  You can go out and buy it like you can go out and buy a 15-yard ribbon blender, but on the use market
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:42.480]  It's probably be eighty ninety thousand dollars
[02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:48.000]  So, you know if you if you're good at machining and welding and fabricating
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:51.280]  Like just start looking around for things that look
[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:53.840]  like the right shape
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:39:01.240]  And and I do like Mitchell Ellis I and and I've got I've got used equipment of most different brands
[02:39:01.240 --> 02:39:03.240]  we've got a big a
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:07.080]  120 yard or cubic foot
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:09.880]  Bolden and Lawson Pete bail breaker
[02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:13.280]  nothing does fine, but
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:21.800]  Really be creative if you can I think there's a whole world of reusing other equipment from other industries
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:25.240]  And bringing it into your own and and
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:29.280]  that's how you can try to be profitable is is
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:36.040]  And and also save the planet and in Hawaii. I would be looking at the sugarcane
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:43.240]  there were so much sugarcane world in Hawaii and all of it died when it went to like Costa Rica or some trash and
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:50.320]  And all of that moving sugar is going to be the same about the same thing as moving soil substrates
[02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:53.360]  So you're gonna find a lot of good conveyors a lot of good
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:39:58.920]  Equipment like that, but you just the main thing is to make sure it's gentle on the soil
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:05.080]  That's especially if you're doing living living stuff. Well, you had even said that you found one of your conveyors
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:09.400]  They're like a used bookstore. So you got to really think it. Yeah, you got a really
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:15.840]  Yeah book warehouse. It was a book conveyor that one that was done in the core blocks that little guy
[02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:21.680]  Yeah, it hauled books from somewhere to somewhere and they had the motor on the bottom not on the top and
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:26.880]  bought that thing for a couple hundred bucks on Craigslist my dad brought it out from the Springs and
[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:30.360]  We got it all tuned back up and that thing's awesome
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:38.320]  It's MacGyver it out, but it's it's solid. You know, I mean, I think that's what you want, right your equipment to work
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:40.120]  That's it for sure
[02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:45.720]  And there are a lot of things that we can only do when we MacGyver it like when you buy a piece of equipment
[02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:48.440]  You get what you get and even that Mitchell Ellis
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:55.280]  We've had to heavily modify it like there were things about that that I've I've grumped and curse Mitchell Ellis, you know
[02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:59.280]  The shaft in the middle used to always slide out the side of the bearing
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:04.840]  so we had to tap the bore and tap the center of the shaft on that thing and put stops and
[02:41:05.240 --> 02:41:09.720]  Like it's tuned up and and all our stuff tuned up and that's why
[02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:12.280]  We can do some more stuff is
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:18.840]  Because we took some extra effort and then you can customize it to just the way you want it and then you can do some magic
[02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:21.600]  so
[02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:26.840]  Open mind, you know, like when I see something I don't see it as what it is
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:32.160]  I see it as what I can use it for like, you know, but and that's just having an open mind
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:36.080]  Well, it's using your available
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:40.840]  Materials to create what you need in order to move forward
[02:41:43.480 --> 02:41:44.600]  So
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:46.960]  waggle dance and that's a bee reference
[02:41:47.720 --> 02:41:54.080]  Are the compost and castings adding the microbiology needed for the soils to break down the other?
[02:41:54.640 --> 02:42:01.800]  Ingredients and if so, how long with a bag or yard or how long will a bag or yard last?
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:05.720]  Without reamending it if you tried water only
[02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:14.820]  Know the composting cat. Well the compost and castings are adding all the biology. They're not adding all the
[02:42:15.340 --> 02:42:17.760]  mineralization as long as as
[02:42:18.420 --> 02:42:22.360]  The environments, right? You don't let it get too hot or too dry or something like that
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:29.480]  The biology will keep going sure. You can pump it up with a tea like I love a good actively aerated tea or
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:31.920]  You know
[02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:34.480]  There are a lot of a lot of different
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:41.000]  things that Brian and Marco talk about that can help re-inoculate a soil but
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:45.640]  but in the end you got to keep that mineralization going and
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:52.880]  So, you know most of our stuff like with veggies the bomb can grow almost any veggie for a full season
[02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:58.640]  No feed you could grow ten rounds of lettuce in the bomb and and not have to feed anything
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:02.360]  with cannabis cannabis is a very high feeder and
[02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:10.560]  The thing here's where I like mostly difference from say a coot or a sub cool mix or something like that. Is that?
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:15.640]  That I don't try to put all the the biology and I land somewhere
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:21.360]  Between living organic and super soil and people take me to task for this all the time
[02:43:21.360 --> 02:43:24.040]  But it's just you know, don't try and put me in a cage
[02:43:24.640 --> 02:43:30.720]  I'm gonna do something different and I've always done it different and I wasn't like kind of a forum guy
[02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:32.720]  I did my own thing and
[02:43:33.320 --> 02:43:35.320]  and so I
[02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:42.660]  Leave the nitrogen purposefully low because when I pump it way up I start seeing a reduction in species diversity
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:47.800]  And and I can put everything else in there. I can put all your other
[02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:54.320]  Trace minerals micronutrients biology as long as I keep the nitrogen tone down
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:56.320]  So I put absolutely as much as I can
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:04.280]  Into into the bomb, but then that's why you need to supplement a little and it's a I think it's kind of a feature
[02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:09.960]  More than a bug because if you have a certain a sensitive a nitrogen sensitive strain
[02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:14.600]  You're not going to burn it if you and the aminos of course help buffer that too
[02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:17.200]  But really that's the the magic to me
[02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:24.040]  Also, if I've put like, you know, we were just talking about Marco putting all this work into your fine cure compost
[02:44:24.040 --> 02:44:30.760]  It doesn't make sense to me to come back with one of these mixes and then run the whole thing up to 140 degrees
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:33.240]  Again, there went all your biology. So
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:38.920]  It's one of the things about our new blend that took me the longest to figure out was how to
[02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:45.880]  Get all these newts in and then not have it go back up in temperature too much and we focus a lot of our
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:50.120]  Process in that and having it at the most hopefully, you know
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:55.240]  I'd say 109 is my highest that I ever want to see it go even in the summer
[02:44:56.840 --> 02:44:59.320]  And it's we we live right on that cusp
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:04.600]  Sometimes when it's hot out for sure and and we're making a lot of soil
[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:11.960]  But yeah, I feel like it's where the magic lies on keeping the species diversity up and and why you see these customers with these totes
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:19.560]  There's a guy that just wrote me on instagram and he's like, this is crazy. It's gnarly and the whole top of his tote was full of mushrooms
[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:27.000]  That's because we could we could keep that biology alive through that whole process. So
[02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:29.800]  Yeah veggies a year with the mineral
[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:31.640]  Three weeks
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:37.400]  With canna stuff in the bomb and it won't you won't see a deficiency until week five or six
[02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:39.880]  And then it's only a nitrogen deficiency
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:46.200]  But that's the cool thing. You don't have to worry about all the trace minerals the micronutrients any of that junk just focus on
[02:45:47.080 --> 02:45:52.680]  Your nitrogen and flour and your pho or nitrogen and veg and your phos and flour
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:55.560]  Fantastic
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:45:58.760]  You want to say something marco
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:01.400]  No, I just said perfect
[02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:07.080]  Oh, that's I I saw your lips move and I saw those beautiful white teeth shining there and i'm just going okay
[02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:11.240]  Marco wants to say something. No, no, perfect. Yeah, my man's on it
[02:46:12.680 --> 02:46:14.680]  Yeah, I'm just saying
[02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:17.240]  Yeah, I'm just saying
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:21.720]  Okay, marco wants to say something no, no perfect. Yeah, my man's on it
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:30.760]  Okay, peace of mind farms wants to ask what's the biggest mistake people make when trying to build their own living soil
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:33.400]  What's the hype and what's for real?
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:38.440]  over compost every time every organic farm every
[02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:44.220]  Like all the time people put in too much compost and scorch everything with potassium
[02:46:44.540 --> 02:46:51.100]  And then i'd say after that it's just like mineral ratios and then after that it's using a window turned compost
[02:46:51.100 --> 02:46:53.100]  That's all bacterial
[02:46:53.980 --> 02:46:57.980]  And then it's not putting the right predatory insects in
[02:46:59.340 --> 02:47:04.460]  I'd say those are probably the top things I see that are kind of hard hard to do, right?
[02:47:06.140 --> 02:47:09.260]  Yeah, I've seen too when people buy like uh, the the
[02:47:09.420 --> 02:47:11.420]  The the
[02:47:11.500 --> 02:47:13.740]  You know like the landfill compost and stuff
[02:47:14.220 --> 02:47:17.500]  Uh, they can have problems because they're kind of going super cheap with that
[02:47:18.220 --> 02:47:20.540]  So yeah, I think your quality compost
[02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:23.420]  matters and then of course
[02:47:23.420 --> 02:47:27.180]  As layton always says don't be a moron with any one of these things
[02:47:27.900 --> 02:47:32.060]  Because there is kind of like a goldilocks aspect to a lot of this stuff
[02:47:32.860 --> 02:47:38.140]  Yeah, and and you know building and building that ipm like uh, like bart said earlier, you know
[02:47:38.140 --> 02:47:40.620]  I like to water in things like bt, you know
[02:47:41.100 --> 02:47:46.300]  Um to get that to get ahead of the fungus gnats because usually when you build that living soil
[02:47:46.780 --> 02:47:48.780]  Um, you do get that bloom
[02:47:48.940 --> 02:47:54.220]  um, but if you kind of are proactive and build in those, you know those ipm
[02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:58.780]  nematodes and bt and those kind of things you can get ahead of that so
[02:47:59.740 --> 02:48:01.740]  That's it
[02:48:01.980 --> 02:48:08.240]  Okay, here's one what can be amended to the soil in veg stage when growing cannabis
[02:48:11.020 --> 02:48:17.020]  Well, really anything can be amended in veg stage exactly I mean obviously you're going to want a lot of nitrogen and veg
[02:48:18.860 --> 02:48:25.660]  Uh and and for nitrogen either like like our soy amino or soluble if you want a soluble or
[02:48:26.940 --> 02:48:28.220]  feather meal
[02:48:28.220 --> 02:48:30.620]  fish bone meal fossilized seabird guano
[02:48:31.420 --> 02:48:33.420]  Or no, sorry, uh, um
[02:48:34.540 --> 02:48:38.240]  Uh bone meal blood meal things like that high nitrogen
[02:48:39.020 --> 02:48:45.740]  Usually protein-y type stuff, but you want your whole rest of your profile to be in ratio. You can't ignore any of the minerals
[02:48:46.300 --> 02:48:49.260]  So you really you know when i'm when i'm looking at our thing
[02:48:49.420 --> 02:48:53.340]  I end up spending thousands of dollars in tests on every one of our inputs
[02:48:53.900 --> 02:48:55.820]  so I know
[02:48:55.820 --> 02:49:00.620]  You know this has this much of this and this and you got to stack it all together and that's why it's an art
[02:49:00.700 --> 02:49:01.980]  that's why
[02:49:01.980 --> 02:49:06.860]  You just can't take 22 random things and throw it together and anything and have it work out
[02:49:07.500 --> 02:49:10.780]  and sometimes I feel like i'm the hammer looking for a nail but
[02:49:11.340 --> 02:49:16.140]  To me the soil is where it is all at. It's probably 80 or 90 percent of the game
[02:49:16.860 --> 02:49:22.860]  And and it's what made me want to do this and why I think it's so fascinating and so important to get the soil, right?
[02:49:23.740 --> 02:49:29.580]  Um and people think they'll think oh i've got a black thumb or something like that. I just don't think that exists
[02:49:30.220 --> 02:49:33.500]  I think you just had had some soil that was out of whack
[02:49:34.460 --> 02:49:35.500]  um
[02:49:35.500 --> 02:49:38.380]  And you you get your soil right and everything else will come back
[02:49:39.100 --> 02:49:41.100]  Come back into alignment
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:43.900]  Definitely
[02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:49.360]  So the next one from ryan, do you have a high fungal mix for my blueberries?
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:51.760]  Well, the dynamic
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.880]  is definitely super high fungal and
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:50:02.400]  All of our mixes have those fungal biologies. The main thing about blueberries is they want it acidic and
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:09.440]  So you can take you know, you can take something like the bomb or cut flower mix and just be
[02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:13.760]  Making sure you're using enough citric acid in it and drive it down
[02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:16.320]  you just got to drive the ph down and
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:18.480]  Ph down and
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:23.920]  In nature, that's the interesting thing. If you look at a map of precipitation in the u.s. It's going to
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:25.660]  almost
[02:50:25.660 --> 02:50:28.800]  Identically correlate to a map of ph of the u.s
[02:50:29.440 --> 02:50:32.320]  Places where there's a lot of rain washing through the ground
[02:50:33.040 --> 02:50:39.040]  It's going to be acidic places that are dry desert like arid. They're going to be alkali
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:44.720]  And and you just have to remember that and that's why blueberries grow in these wet
[02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:49.520]  Areas and why they like acidic areas. That's where they they grow
[02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:51.440]  so
[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:54.640]  You know if you're going to take a plant out of its natural environment
[02:50:54.640 --> 02:51:01.360]  You at least have to recreate that environment and acid is probably one of the biggest factors in my opinion in growing blueberries
[02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:04.960]  So yeah, if you wanted to take something like the bomb or cut flower mix
[02:51:05.360 --> 02:51:09.460]  I do have people grow container blueberries in colorado quite successfully
[02:51:10.160 --> 02:51:14.240]  You just have to make sure you're not watering with your ph9 water or whatever. That's for sure
[02:51:15.680 --> 02:51:18.720]  Oh most definitely that'll kill them really fast
[02:51:19.360 --> 02:51:25.440]  So checker bob wants to know when's your pania be available in main at a
[02:51:26.380 --> 02:51:28.380]  paonio buddy
[02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:31.840]  Yeah at an affordable
[02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:36.640]  Affordable shipping price. Well, I would say when people start sending semis there
[02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:39.920]  We need a we need a group of folks to get together
[02:51:40.720 --> 02:51:45.520]  Um and say and we've got some more store that would carry some or some stores
[02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:50.880]  Yeah, any anyone that'll take it so go to your local grow store go to your garden center go to your
[02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:54.880]  Or get some farms together or whatever you want to do, you know
[02:51:55.520 --> 02:52:00.240]  but uh, but get somebody together that'll bring that semi in and we've got some
[02:52:00.880 --> 02:52:02.800]  really amazing local
[02:52:02.800 --> 02:52:05.600]  Truckers or cowboys that this is what they do
[02:52:06.480 --> 02:52:08.800]  Um, and they move those trucks for cheap
[02:52:09.440 --> 02:52:14.080]  And so, you know, it's expensive to move little bitty quantities of things
[02:52:14.640 --> 02:52:21.920]  But a semi is a pretty efficient way to move it. So yeah, if you want you want some reasonably priced soil in main
[02:52:22.640 --> 02:52:24.480]  um pretty much
[02:52:24.480 --> 02:52:28.240]  get a get a group together and put in for a semi load and
[02:52:28.800 --> 02:52:35.280]  Kate our sales director does stellar work like putting three four stores together because we know not everyone can buy
[02:52:35.840 --> 02:52:37.840]  you know 80 yards a
[02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:42.320]  Soil right off the bat or something like that, but get three or four stores together
[02:52:42.800 --> 02:52:46.260]  Go in on a semi split it up amongst your community
[02:52:46.960 --> 02:52:52.400]  And uh, and that goes a long way to getting that ball rolling, but we support everyone everywhere. So
[02:52:53.360 --> 02:52:59.600]  Um, there you go cheddar get out there and talk to the stores and bring it in
[02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:03.360]  Yes, sir
[02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:06.720]  So, uh kts wants to know what's in the bomb mix
[02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:11.760]  Uh, you can go to the website and you can actually see it right there, but do you want to cover a little bit?
[02:53:12.240 --> 02:53:16.640]  yeah, we we put it all out brian's gonna get one of our bags here, but uh,
[02:53:17.280 --> 02:53:19.280]  You know, of course we start with the peats
[02:53:19.600 --> 02:53:21.600]  uh, we get into uh
[02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:25.360]  Uh the worm castings the kelp
[02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:31.680]  There you go
[02:53:34.480 --> 02:53:36.480]  Was that one one cubic foot
[02:53:38.800 --> 02:53:40.800]  Oh y'all knock the mute off
[02:53:42.320 --> 02:53:46.560]  Can't hear you we lost your microphone guys. There we go. We're back. We're back
[02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:50.400]  So yeah, this is a two cubic footer two cube. Oh big boy
[02:53:50.960 --> 02:53:52.240]  Yeah, we
[02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:58.400]  We uh, we do some ones but really most people that are buying our stuff are doing doing something something
[02:53:59.360 --> 02:54:03.040]  Can you get the semi and broken down in that two cubic foot size?
[02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:09.680]  Uh, absolutely. Yeah. No, you can get a semi loaded two cubic footers if you want you can get the bulk bags
[02:54:10.240 --> 02:54:12.960]  Each bulk bag is 13 and a half of these
[02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:15.520]  So that kind of gives you an idea
[02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:18.020]  178 I think you said yeah, exactly
[02:54:18.560 --> 02:54:22.160]  It's 26 pallets. So it's 50 of these bags on a pallet
[02:54:22.720 --> 02:54:27.360]  26 pallets on a truck. You can actually move a little more in the bags than the totes
[02:54:27.920 --> 02:54:30.000]  But the totes are a little bit better price
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:34.640]  But here I can read off the rest of these ingredients for you
[02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:43.760]  I'm getting a workout today. That's it. That's how we do it. So, um
[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:49.120]  You know, obviously the peats then the the perlite the compost
[02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:51.600]  um
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:54.180]  And then you get into the uh worm castings
[02:54:54.960 --> 02:54:58.260]  kelp meal feather meal oyster shell flower gypsum
[02:54:59.020 --> 02:55:02.960]  dolomite lime molasses azomite fish bone meal
[02:55:03.740 --> 02:55:05.920]  fossilized seabird guano humate
[02:55:06.780 --> 02:55:08.780]  mastodon feet
[02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:10.880]  uh
[02:55:10.940 --> 02:55:13.680]  Mycorrhizal inoculant green sand
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:15.840]  um
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:17.680]  citric acid
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:19.780]  manganese sulfate zinc sulfate
[02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:22.400]  potash
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:24.400]  and uh
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:28.220]  Boron
[02:55:28.620 --> 02:55:31.580]  That took a while for you to get to do that the right way because
[02:55:32.220 --> 02:55:36.620]  That many amendments if it's not dialed in it's usually going to cause problems. So yeah
[02:55:37.180 --> 02:55:38.940]  Yeah, that's a
[02:55:38.940 --> 02:55:43.180]  Tried and true that's it dialed right there. That's what we call it dialed in
[02:55:44.460 --> 02:55:49.660]  That's a lot of stuff in that bag and then that's a big bag too. You guys hear that thud?
[02:55:49.980 --> 02:55:52.380]  Yeah, that's the tube boy. That's the big boy
[02:55:53.580 --> 02:55:55.580]  That's it
[02:55:55.660 --> 02:55:57.180]  Okay
[02:55:57.180 --> 02:55:58.540]  Synchronous
[02:55:58.540 --> 02:56:00.540]  Oh, I bet yeah
[02:56:00.940 --> 02:56:06.000]  So how about just a fungal food or fungal fungal amendments any recommendations?
[02:56:06.240 --> 02:56:10.000]  Sure, like of course a lot of fungal organisms like wood
[02:56:10.960 --> 02:56:14.960]  Um, you know, like if i'm making a tea and I want to push it more fungally
[02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:19.760]  Directed I would use like a fish hydrosolate or something like that
[02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:22.160]  um
[02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:24.160]  and and
[02:56:24.320 --> 02:56:26.320]  just like um
[02:56:26.800 --> 02:56:32.080]  You know almost anything can be decomposed by a fungal organism. It's it's shocking
[02:56:32.080 --> 02:56:37.680]  It's it's shocking. I mean certain fungal organisms can eat radioactive waste and
[02:56:38.480 --> 02:56:40.240]  um that king strep
[02:56:40.240 --> 02:56:41.600]  various
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:48.880]  Garden giant mushroom is one of the only things that can break down persistent herbicides and like when brian was talking about
[02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:51.280]  compost problems
[02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:59.040]  That's one that pops up is if you've got like amino pyrrolid residue that came through from the grain through the animals
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:04.240]  Um, it's one of the only chemicals that the compost decomposers can't break down
[02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:08.400]  and so if you've got amino pyrrolid or roundup in um
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:10.080]  uh
[02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:11.120]  like
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:15.360]  In that compost that's going to kill all the all the plant
[02:57:16.080 --> 02:57:17.440]  you know, it's
[02:57:17.440 --> 02:57:19.440]  and and so
[02:57:19.580 --> 02:57:24.420]  Amazingly somehow those things can even still be a food for a fungal organism
[02:57:25.140 --> 02:57:28.740]  So really almost anything but I do love wood and
[02:57:29.940 --> 02:57:34.740]  wood and uh and fish products to some degree for for culturing certain
[02:57:35.540 --> 02:57:36.980]  fungal species
[02:57:36.980 --> 02:57:38.980]  Leaf mold is a good one, too
[02:57:39.380 --> 02:57:42.120]  Nice leaf mold is always beneficial
[02:57:42.740 --> 02:57:44.020]  There you go
[02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:49.380]  Now taylor s has a random question. He says I have I keep heavily
[02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:52.920]  Planted aquariums which require fertilizer
[02:57:53.780 --> 02:58:00.280]  Would watering my soil with aquarium water that contains fertilizer hurt my soil by algae?
[02:58:01.220 --> 02:58:03.320]  It uh, it's mostly sulfates
[02:58:06.020 --> 02:58:11.700]  Probably to some degree yeah, I would think so too because it's those are those are two different worlds
[02:58:13.220 --> 02:58:18.100]  But again, that's the whole point of the fun of it is maybe you should try it then let us know
[02:58:18.660 --> 02:58:23.940]  Yeah, I think from a aquatic feed your aquarium fertilize your aquarium must have plants in it
[02:58:24.340 --> 02:58:26.340]  Yeah, I think they're having plants in it
[02:58:26.740 --> 02:58:31.460]  Well, you should i'm not gonna tell you that but fish poop will feed the plants
[02:58:31.460 --> 02:58:36.420]  So maybe focus a little bit on that you can get away from the chemicals there, too. I have
[02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:41.640]  150 gallon aquarium and I don't use chemicals, you know, so they're not necessary
[02:58:42.580 --> 02:58:44.580]  um in an aquarium setting either
[02:58:45.140 --> 02:58:47.620]  Well, I know I used to do aquaponics and
[02:58:48.340 --> 02:58:50.340]  using the the fish manure
[02:58:50.580 --> 02:58:55.220]  Was what was feeding the plants and then the plants cleaned the water to give back to the fish
[02:58:55.220 --> 02:58:57.860]  So it's a natural cycle. That's for sure
[02:58:59.700 --> 02:59:03.540]  I mean it could add some diversity. I think sorry go ahead brian
[02:59:03.780 --> 02:59:06.020]  I think there could be some benefits to the diversity
[02:59:06.020 --> 02:59:09.860]  But usually when people get kind of gung-ho on that they add a little too much
[02:59:09.860 --> 02:59:12.020]  So that's why I would add that caveat is
[02:59:12.100 --> 02:59:13.700]  That caveat is
[02:59:13.700 --> 02:59:17.060]  I would be I would be cautious to talk to layton about something
[02:59:17.700 --> 02:59:22.100]  Yeah, well, he would also be better to answer that question. Um, because he'll tell you
[02:59:23.460 --> 02:59:26.200]  Right on there, but not with the sulfates
[02:59:26.900 --> 02:59:27.780]  Right. Yeah
[02:59:27.780 --> 02:59:31.460]  If it didn't have a so my fish brew is what he'd tell you. Yeah, he'd tell you
[02:59:32.500 --> 02:59:33.460]  Tell us about that
[02:59:33.460 --> 02:59:41.080]  Which is it's kind of interesting because like a lot of the people out here try to use sulfur to combat alkalinity
[02:59:42.020 --> 02:59:46.100]  But then you go sulfur toxic and I think that's what you're going to end up doing there is just
[02:59:46.740 --> 02:59:50.980]  building your sulfur soil sulfur levels to the point of toxicity and
[02:59:51.300 --> 02:59:55.460]  It's tough like sulfur is a hard thing to get to toxic levels. No doubt
[02:59:55.860 --> 02:59:59.620]  But there is a threshold once you go past it. It ain't gonna work, right?
[03:00:00.260 --> 03:00:02.260]  You're toast once you go past it
[03:00:02.500 --> 03:00:08.760]  And then don't all sulfates kind of compound to ultimately be that sulfur to get you into that toxicity
[03:00:09.300 --> 03:00:11.300]  It's my experience. That's it
[03:00:11.780 --> 03:00:17.140]  Harley smith, I think uh, who's with mpk industries. I think he has a few videos on that even
[03:00:17.940 --> 03:00:19.940]  That's where I learned that from. Yeah
[03:00:20.420 --> 03:00:24.580]  So we got one last question guys right at the three hour mark here
[03:00:25.460 --> 03:00:30.180]  Uh can root it or rooted cuts go straight into full strength soil
[03:00:30.900 --> 03:00:36.100]  Yep, absolutely the bomb you can you can plant seeds or cuts right into the bomb
[03:00:36.660 --> 03:00:40.980]  You'll get super high germination rates. Um, the cuts love it
[03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:47.540]  It's specifically designed in that way. And that's that's why I keep my nitrogen dialed back just a little bit
[03:00:48.180 --> 03:00:50.420]  so you can put a cut right into it and
[03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:52.660]  you know, we've had
[03:00:52.660 --> 03:00:58.020]  Their years in colorado in the hemp era where we had. Um, I think one year we had over 10 million
[03:00:58.580 --> 03:01:01.160]  Cuts in our soil in the state of colorado
[03:01:01.860 --> 03:01:04.020]  And they had in the high 90s
[03:01:04.740 --> 03:01:10.340]  You know 99 point something percent success rate with with all those starts. Um,
[03:01:11.060 --> 03:01:15.060]  And and most of our growers that's what they're doing they're going straight into the bomb
[03:01:15.540 --> 03:01:18.980]  The only thing I wouldn't use the bomb to try to root a cut
[03:01:19.780 --> 03:01:24.420]  Directly i'd use something else for that. But once it's got roots stick it in there and run it
[03:01:26.900 --> 03:01:28.900]  Fantastic
[03:01:29.540 --> 03:01:32.180]  And that's it guys it's three hours and one minute
[03:01:34.420 --> 03:01:39.380]  Well, uh, I I do want to uh marco, uh, we've been doing this for a year now buddy
[03:01:39.620 --> 03:01:42.100]  Uh last year I think it was like official. Whoa
[03:01:42.660 --> 03:01:44.660]  Oh happy anniversary guys
[03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:51.860]  Congratulations boys. Yeah, man. Uh, so it's been it's been awesome dude the fact that you know, you're showing up unless we're in timeout
[03:01:52.340 --> 03:01:56.920]  Uh, you know each and every week, you know, I don't think most of our viewers understand
[03:01:57.620 --> 03:02:02.980]  The work that goes behind the scenes, uh, and I believe ken we've been uh, you know, four or five months
[03:02:03.460 --> 03:02:08.660]  So time has been flying by I appreciate you as well, sir, and I just wanted to put that out there. It's been
[03:02:09.380 --> 03:02:13.060]  It's been a year. So, uh, yeah, it's been great man. It's been fun, man
[03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:15.620]  You know sometimes i'm like man
[03:02:15.620 --> 03:02:19.460]  So busy, can I do this? Can I keep going but then somebody hits me up man?
[03:02:19.460 --> 03:02:22.100]  Are y'all doing the show? We want to see y'all so it's like
[03:02:22.660 --> 03:02:27.860]  I'm gonna be here as long as I don't have another commitment as far as on a week by week basis
[03:02:28.340 --> 03:02:32.020]  um, and hopefully we can hit every week like we should
[03:02:32.660 --> 03:02:38.180]  But you know when when you got you got things to do you got to do them, you know, I mean well luckily
[03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:40.580]  Hey, we're putting good karma out there. You're I know you're
[03:02:41.140 --> 03:02:43.780]  Taking off you got all that stuff. Um, and you know
[03:02:44.020 --> 03:02:46.740]  i'm driving down here because we got other stuff going on and
[03:02:47.380 --> 03:02:51.940]  I think I think the reality is is that uh, good things are coming from this show
[03:02:52.420 --> 03:02:55.620]  Uh, and i'm proud to say that we're not sponsored or anything
[03:02:56.180 --> 03:03:02.980]  And I like that marco. I think at first we were maybe toiling with that but it's sponsored by uh, by marco and myself
[03:03:03.220 --> 03:03:04.260]  uh
[03:03:04.260 --> 03:03:06.260]  ken and uh and peter
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:11.540]  Congratulations guys. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, it's been kind of cool, dude. Are you it is?
[03:03:12.100 --> 03:03:16.500]  Well, it's why I like hanging out with you because you're sincere about what you do. You want to help other people
[03:03:16.900 --> 03:03:19.220]  I saw that about marco when we were out in tulsa
[03:03:19.860 --> 03:03:24.100]  he he has those same same um ideals and
[03:03:24.900 --> 03:03:29.380]  Not not everybody does these days. So nice work boys and way to stick at it
[03:03:29.700 --> 03:03:32.100]  i'm glad he agreed to be the co-host man, I think
[03:03:32.900 --> 03:03:34.900]  There's a great show on thursday
[03:03:35.220 --> 03:03:38.900]  Uh, but but this show is different man with the way that you're bringing it
[03:03:38.980 --> 03:03:42.500]  so it's like we kind of have two shows but at the same time not really because
[03:03:43.380 --> 03:03:46.740]  It's just a totally different show, uh having you marco
[03:03:47.220 --> 03:03:49.220]  um, so, you know
[03:03:50.020 --> 03:03:50.420]  Yeah, man
[03:03:50.420 --> 03:03:53.380]  this is this has been a joy and I've learned so much and
[03:03:53.860 --> 03:03:57.300]  I know my business is taking off because i'm sitting here with you boys each and every week
[03:03:57.380 --> 03:04:02.100]  So I appreciate that and I guess in a way where i'm also getting uh getting things out of this
[03:04:02.260 --> 03:04:04.260]  Uh just by the education alone
[03:04:04.820 --> 03:04:10.260]  We get three hours of learning every week and then like, you know, that's a lot of time it adds up
[03:04:10.340 --> 03:04:13.780]  I haven't done the math, but you know, we've done three hours and a lot of shows and
[03:04:14.420 --> 03:04:18.180]  Over time, that's all I tell my wife. Shoot. I'm i'm on here. I'm learning
[03:04:19.060 --> 03:04:21.620]  I'm bringing people on that I can learn from you know
[03:04:22.100 --> 03:04:27.300]  Hell, yeah, you always wanted to ask him questions and stuff, you know, you just bring them on and then you just get to ask him
[03:04:27.380 --> 03:04:28.980]  So that's cool
[03:04:28.980 --> 03:04:30.820]  Well, that's why i'm doing this
[03:04:30.820 --> 03:04:37.620]  You know, I don't want any money because my money is the education that I receive every time I do one of these shows
[03:04:37.700 --> 03:04:40.420]  You guys are absolutely amazing. Yes, sir
[03:04:41.460 --> 03:04:44.980]  Nice, but we'll keep it going shit. Ain't no no need to stop it now
[03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:49.780]  So brian, you got anything that you have coming up you want to talk about?
[03:04:50.740 --> 03:04:57.060]  Uh tomorrow, you know, i'm i'm hanging out with with bart for a couple days. So tomorrow, uh, we'll have uh
[03:04:57.300 --> 03:05:03.780]  Bart back if he wants but we we also have alex who um, you know, it's been it's taken me a couple weeks and again
[03:05:03.780 --> 03:05:05.060]  with last week
[03:05:05.060 --> 03:05:12.740]  Uh being in timeout moving things around. Uh, but but alex is uh teaching on a on a different level man, and there's so many
[03:05:13.540 --> 03:05:16.260]  Topics out there that I know most people would never touch with me
[03:05:16.900 --> 03:05:22.340]  And alex is willing to to talk about those things. So we're going to talk about something called the bilderberg group
[03:05:22.740 --> 03:05:26.900]  Um, it's something that's near and dear to me. I have gone down the rabbit hole
[03:05:27.460 --> 03:05:30.840]  Many nights, you know enjoying cannabis sometimes some mushrooms
[03:05:31.380 --> 03:05:37.540]  And finding out about who in a way might actually really run this world and and why they meet in secret
[03:05:38.100 --> 03:05:41.700]  And I think there's a lot to learn about that kind of stuff. So we're having alex on again
[03:05:42.100 --> 03:05:45.620]  um, and again, we appreciate your feedback with this kind of stuff, you know, we
[03:05:46.580 --> 03:05:49.140]  We're trying to have shows obviously with cannabis
[03:05:49.700 --> 03:05:55.220]  But I think we need to learn about a few other things in life so you kind of understand more about how
[03:05:56.340 --> 03:05:58.740]  I guess in my opinion how the world really works
[03:05:59.220 --> 03:06:01.780]  Uh, and following if we're following mother nature
[03:06:01.860 --> 03:06:04.180]  Then you know if we're also trying to figure out how things work
[03:06:04.500 --> 03:06:08.820]  We need to find out about what what is the you know, the real elitist, you know
[03:06:08.980 --> 03:06:14.340]  What are they actually doing and this is something that's been around for 50 60 years. I mean this isn't
[03:06:15.220 --> 03:06:20.100]  This isn't around forever though, too, you know even before the mystery schools
[03:06:22.420 --> 03:06:25.300]  And it's always the super rich that get to learn this stuff
[03:06:25.300 --> 03:06:28.900]  So that's why i'm glad that that alex is willing to break this kind of stuff down is
[03:06:29.300 --> 03:06:34.020]  You know, it's like the the poor the middle class. We just kind of like dismiss all of those things
[03:06:34.340 --> 03:06:38.740]  uh, but back in the day, I mean there was a lot of like astrology and I mean even
[03:06:39.220 --> 03:06:42.260]  I almost kind of giggle when I talk about some of that stuff still to this day
[03:06:42.580 --> 03:06:49.140]  Uh, but that's why I love kind of talking about this stuff is there was a real view, uh, especially with leaders
[03:06:50.260 --> 03:06:55.060]  you know that there was something to the metaphysical and there's obviously something to it when the
[03:06:55.940 --> 03:06:57.960]  the richest and the most powerful individuals
[03:06:58.820 --> 03:07:00.820]  Talk about those things
[03:07:01.280 --> 03:07:03.280]  definitely
[03:07:03.460 --> 03:07:10.260]  Definitely educate yourself people, you know, take them take it all in and then make your own decisions about what you think is was what
[03:07:10.340 --> 03:07:12.340]  Is
[03:07:12.340 --> 03:07:14.420]  You know if if all these you know
[03:07:15.380 --> 03:07:22.580]  If if 100 of the most influential people met every year and you knew about that and there was a total media blockout
[03:07:22.980 --> 03:07:27.780]  You know, would you want to know why is that and that's what's been going on with the bilderberg group forever
[03:07:28.260 --> 03:07:30.020]  Is that they all meet in secret?
[03:07:30.020 --> 03:07:33.060]  um, they're supposedly it's off the record so they get to talk about
[03:07:33.700 --> 03:07:36.100]  you know, some people even say some vile stuff where they
[03:07:36.580 --> 03:07:42.520]  You know, they say some people believe that the the planet's overpopulated some people believe that there's not enough uh population
[03:07:43.220 --> 03:07:48.580]  Um, you know, there's a whole view that like the japanese. Um, they don't procreate anymore
[03:07:48.820 --> 03:07:53.780]  So there's a view that they're you know, there's just so much into it and that's what the bilderberg group
[03:07:54.180 --> 03:07:58.100]  Uh, it kind of talks about these, you know, they are the ultimate think tank
[03:07:59.300 --> 03:08:02.740]  I mean, yeah, y'all are gonna have a good time, but it's shit like, you know
[03:08:03.060 --> 03:08:08.820]  Making men less masculine like putting all this shit out there in society where people are like, you know
[03:08:09.540 --> 03:08:13.460]  Letting their guard down guys. It's a lot to a guy jump on in there and check them out
[03:08:13.700 --> 03:08:17.780]  I'm versed on it, but I might stop by just to listen in because it's always fun
[03:08:18.180 --> 03:08:22.660]  And it's always shit that makes you think like damn really like real, you know, so
[03:08:23.540 --> 03:08:26.580]  And then alex backs it up with facts. I mean we're not sitting here talking about
[03:08:27.220 --> 03:08:31.220]  Uh, no disrespect but like sandy hook or something that obviously is fake
[03:08:31.460 --> 03:08:37.780]  Uh, you know, that's the problem with people that that go on the fringe is like they just keep going on that
[03:08:37.780 --> 03:08:42.820]  And that's the part that I don't like I just want to I want the facts and that's what alex is all about
[03:08:43.060 --> 03:08:45.060]  That's the other alex
[03:08:45.460 --> 03:08:51.620]  Not alex jones. That's it. No, no. No. Yeah. Yeah. I got the real alex. I got alex ritter alex jones
[03:08:52.020 --> 03:08:54.340]  In defense some of his stuff has been legit
[03:08:54.660 --> 03:08:56.660]  But some of his stuff is complete bullshit
[03:08:56.740 --> 03:09:02.020]  And that's why I hate people that do that because then everybody classifies everything that man says is bullshit
[03:09:02.740 --> 03:09:08.100]  Which now it does seem like most of it was just for money. So that's what obviously we don't want to promote
[03:09:08.580 --> 03:09:15.140]  But the bilderberg group isn't a fairy tale. These people exist and you should know about it real deal
[03:09:15.220 --> 03:09:18.180]  yeah, mr. Tate wanted to know if you're ever going to have a
[03:09:18.800 --> 03:09:23.780]  Patreon so that uh, he can support what we you guys are doing here
[03:09:24.660 --> 03:09:30.740]  Well to be honest with you there's the gratitude and stuff or whatever whatever is being built from this show
[03:09:30.980 --> 03:09:35.860]  I promise you that i'm doing fine and marco's doing fine, you know
[03:09:35.860 --> 03:09:42.980]  so if if we need to I guess talk about this behind the scenes, but I I am so blessed with the fact that
[03:09:44.340 --> 03:09:49.700]  I can sell sell bugs across the country and people want to buy them
[03:09:50.340 --> 03:09:56.500]  So that that is that is what my patreon link would be is that for whatever reason man
[03:09:56.740 --> 03:10:04.020]  I have tapped into something and I am so grateful for it. That's why we do this for free is because we don't need that
[03:10:04.500 --> 03:10:05.860]  um
[03:10:05.860 --> 03:10:08.660]  I guess i'm speaking for myself, but I know marco. He's uh,
[03:10:09.220 --> 03:10:15.460]  My goal is to be as successful as marco. So, uh, we we have free time because behind the scenes
[03:10:16.020 --> 03:10:17.780]  We work really hard
[03:10:17.780 --> 03:10:23.060]  And if you really want to support us today buy some soil from this man, I appreciate it. Yeah
[03:10:24.100 --> 03:10:26.100]  If I just mailed you bugs today
[03:10:27.380 --> 03:10:28.900]  By the way
[03:10:28.900 --> 03:10:30.900]  Is that a good thing or not?
[03:10:31.300 --> 03:10:37.380]  Yeah, but we mail each other bugs and stuff. Yeah, we do we we're chopping it. We're gonna be uh, we're gonna be bugs feature
[03:10:38.100 --> 03:10:39.220]  Yeah, sorry
[03:10:39.220 --> 03:10:43.860]  Imagine if your cannabis seeds could procreate that's what we're doing. So yeah
[03:10:44.340 --> 03:10:48.420]  And cheers to you guys for for doing it without the money and uh,
[03:10:48.980 --> 03:10:54.100]  And if y'all want an online place to donate i'm on the board of directors of a little theater here in paonia
[03:10:54.180 --> 03:10:58.040]  That's on the edge of surviving and it's on coloradogives.org
[03:10:59.220 --> 03:11:03.060]  Um, so I will give a little plug to that because that's kind of the the main
[03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:07.700]  bastion of lgbtq thinking out here of
[03:11:08.260 --> 03:11:12.180]  art of of the things that are important and so that's uh,
[03:11:12.800 --> 03:11:17.060]  Colorado gives.org and it's friends of the paradise theater
[03:11:17.620 --> 03:11:24.740]  And if you just do like 10 bucks a month or something like that that makes this place survive and we do living soils talks
[03:11:25.460 --> 03:11:28.740]  Um, it's it's really just a community place to do
[03:11:29.380 --> 03:11:34.100]  Everything our little community needs and disney has just about squished it. So
[03:11:35.140 --> 03:11:39.060]  If you want to go on there give us 100 bucks 10 bucks, whatever. We'll take it
[03:11:40.020 --> 03:11:45.940]  It's a great point we always say it help out where your boots touch the ground, you know, you don't need to look at
[03:11:46.740 --> 03:11:54.260]  Syrup, we appreciate that but also help right there in your town. Yeah. Yeah, keep it local. We appreciate everything and
[03:11:55.860 --> 03:12:01.860]  You know to me marco is kind of in a way my mentor man is because he just seems like he always has free time
[03:12:01.940 --> 03:12:04.020]  Even though he's constantly on the go
[03:12:04.660 --> 03:12:06.660]  And that's my goal is to eventually
[03:12:06.980 --> 03:12:10.260]  Uh have that free time but choose to be constantly on the go
[03:12:10.980 --> 03:12:12.660]  Yeah
[03:12:12.660 --> 03:12:19.060]  And like you look at marco's gonna be coming on to for my event donating his time again to help teach people
[03:12:19.540 --> 03:12:25.540]  And that's the beauty of it is if you want to donate to somebody donate to somebody who's teaching people
[03:12:25.860 --> 03:12:28.740]  Whether it's anybody on here or anywhere else
[03:12:29.380 --> 03:12:32.200]  It's that knowledge the caring sharing and community
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:37.640]  And try to spend your money in your community to help the people around you
[03:12:38.600 --> 03:12:41.560]  Boom, that's a good goal bar to finish on right there
[03:12:42.840 --> 03:12:44.840]  Do you have anything coming up brother?
[03:12:47.720 --> 03:12:49.720]  No, i'm good, um, no
[03:12:50.120 --> 03:12:53.160]  Other than my event next weekend. Don't forget. Okay
[03:12:54.120 --> 03:12:56.460]  I'm doing it sunday the day after my anniversary
[03:12:57.080 --> 03:13:00.840]  I'm on with ken you got it locked in if he's thinking anniversary. Yeah
[03:13:00.840 --> 03:13:02.840]  I got you
[03:13:03.400 --> 03:13:08.300]  Hey, I had approval from his wife, okay to allow him this okay, exactly
[03:13:10.120 --> 03:13:12.120]  Okay
[03:13:14.760 --> 03:13:16.760]  We will see you guys all tomorrow
[03:13:16.840 --> 03:13:24.120]  I actually have a private members association meeting that i'm supposed to be in right now speaking of the stuff that brian's talking about
