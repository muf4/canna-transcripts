[00:02.240 --> 00:13.800]  All right. It looks like we're live. If someone in the chat can let me know. Let me know if
[00:13.800 --> 00:20.060]  we're live. Riley Quinn, good morning in Australia to you, top of the morning to all the Australians
[00:20.060 --> 00:27.120]  in the house. Okay. Cool. People are telling me we're live. So let us kick it off. We're
[00:27.120 --> 00:33.960]  here today with Seattle Chronic Seeds, who you may have seen pretty much every day raising
[00:33.960 --> 00:39.680]  money for good causes over the past couple of weeks to let's show him some love by putting
[00:39.680 --> 00:46.720]  a little money into his bank account for all the good he's doing for other people. So welcome.
[00:46.720 --> 00:49.320]  Thanks for having me, man. I appreciate it, Peter.
[00:49.320 --> 00:51.880]  It's almost like we were doing this last week.
[00:51.880 --> 00:58.440]  I think it was like three or four days ago, five days ago. It feels like a long time ago.
[00:58.440 --> 01:07.320]  Yeah. So anyone, to everyone who were becoming a lean mean fighting machine in terms of fulfillment
[01:07.320 --> 01:12.440]  and shipping, we are not quite there yet. So just be patient for another couple of days. But people
[01:12.440 --> 01:18.280]  who want auction seeds, I've been connecting you to the breeders, including the two guys on the
[01:18.280 --> 01:24.760]  screen with me for people who bought seeds on the Dagadot Love website. Those orders are now
[01:24.760 --> 01:32.240]  starting to go out as well. So let's get the party started. So why don't we, Josh, why don't you set
[01:32.240 --> 01:38.720]  the table and kind of talk instead of making him talk about himself and blow smoke up his own ass.
[01:38.720 --> 01:44.760]  Why don't you put your lips on his ass? He's going to have to blow a little bit of smoke on
[01:44.760 --> 01:53.480]  his own ass because I unfortunately, well, we met at the Indow Expo in December and I think we kind
[01:53.480 --> 02:01.000]  of linked up on Facebook even before that, maybe on Instagram. And man, you just, you mailed me a
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.760]  pack of seeds. We're like, yo, dude, let's go sell those things. Let's do this. You were all about
[02:04.760 --> 02:10.200]  hopping on and we didn't even really know each other at all. And we, I just apologize. I haven't
[02:10.200 --> 02:14.600]  had made the time, had time to get on and do what we're doing right now. So dude, I'm sorry, you know,
[02:14.600 --> 02:20.680]  to you for not making time to do that sooner. And just the last few months seeing your heart and
[02:20.680 --> 02:27.320]  your energy towards helping others and helping Nick and all these folks. So Leo, it's been real
[02:27.320 --> 02:31.000]  cool just to get to know you through that aspect, man. And so I'm really honored to finally get time
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  to sit down with you and hear about your genetics and hear about what you've been doing more. And
[02:35.400 --> 02:41.240]  yeah, so really stoked on, on, and you do a mixed spectrum of stuff too. You're not just a THC junkie,
[02:41.240 --> 02:45.560]  which is kind of, I wouldn't expect being in Seattle. You know what I mean? Most Seattle,
[02:45.560 --> 02:49.400]  I just think, you know, people that they're in urban environments are probably crushing the THC.
[02:49.400 --> 02:52.280]  And so, yeah, man, I'll just let you take it away from there.
[02:53.880 --> 02:58.440]  Right on, okay. Well, I guess I'll just kind of start and explain where I came from and
[02:58.600 --> 03:03.560]  the background to me. So, I mean, I've been around cannabis pretty much my whole life.
[03:04.760 --> 03:08.840]  I mean, my friends growing up, we all kind of, you know, experimented with trying to grow a plant,
[03:08.840 --> 03:13.960]  killing it, not ever really being super successful until we got into our late teens and then
[03:14.760 --> 03:17.800]  kind of figuring things out from there. Helped a lot of people.
[03:17.800 --> 03:19.560]  Did you grow up in Washington?
[03:19.560 --> 03:24.280]  I did. Yeah, I actually, I was born and raised, so I was born in Seattle and then we kind of
[03:24.600 --> 03:29.160]  moved towards the Tacoma area where like Northeast Tacoma is pretty much like my
[03:29.160 --> 03:32.440]  stomping grounds where me and my homies used to hang out and stuff. So,
[03:33.800 --> 03:37.400]  that in federal way, good old federal way, but let's not talk about that place.
[03:40.200 --> 03:45.400]  So, yeah, no, I grew up just kind of, you know, helping people out, setting stuff up,
[03:46.200 --> 03:51.640]  black market stuff. I mean, for the most part, just pretty much we just try to figure things
[03:51.960 --> 03:56.600]  out for that. We kind of see what people were doing and then progress ourselves. And then
[03:57.240 --> 04:02.040]  once collective models started kind of rolling out, you know, medical really started taking off.
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  Everyone kind of had their own ideas and some of us took off to California. I stayed in Washington
[04:09.560 --> 04:14.040]  and did my own thing and just kind of worked with a few individuals trying to build a collective
[04:14.040 --> 04:19.640]  and do medical things. But once 502 kind of came around, everybody had different ideas as
[04:19.640 --> 04:26.520]  to what they wanted to do. And it just kind of left me off doing my own thing. And really,
[04:26.520 --> 04:32.920]  I kind of found my place about 2009 and 10 when I was working on a project. Just I couldn't find
[04:32.920 --> 04:38.360]  medicine that would work for my chronic pain. And so I really kind of went to work and was trying
[04:38.360 --> 04:43.640]  to figure out how to incorporate sour deterps and something that was, you know, beneficial for pain,
[04:44.440 --> 04:49.240]  which is essentially a one to one. And so I kind of got into hemp back then and then mixing and
[04:49.240 --> 04:54.040]  making one to ones and just kind of playing around with a bunch of different spectrums,
[04:54.040 --> 04:59.240]  trying to fulfill cannabinoids. And I just got an interest reading dog books, plant books,
[04:59.240 --> 05:04.600]  all sorts of reading material. I mean, because it wasn't readily, you know, cannabis available
[05:04.600 --> 05:09.400]  material then for breeding. So it was really trying to just understand the principles of,
[05:09.960 --> 05:14.840]  you know, generations and genotypes and, you know, how to how to find expressions and things
[05:14.840 --> 05:19.320]  of that nature, like how previous people did it on principles and things of that nature. So
[05:20.360 --> 05:25.480]  that super sour CBD was actually my first project that I took to about an F7
[05:26.520 --> 05:31.480]  stabilized and was able to keep a one to one. And I like to tell people it was like an F7,
[05:31.480 --> 05:35.640]  but it really took me like 11 generations due to back crossing. I had to move that back and
[05:35.720 --> 05:41.400]  forth a few times just to retain stability because a lot of the time on like sour D or
[05:41.400 --> 05:45.480]  things like that, they'd become unstable. And so there were just certain issues that I had.
[05:46.040 --> 05:51.000]  And it really led me to kind of down the path of working with multiple cannabinoids and also
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.560]  different spectrums. And so from there, I really just started playing with different things that
[05:55.560 --> 06:01.160]  most people weren't familiar with. And it was really a trip at first because I saw so many of
[06:02.040 --> 06:07.400]  my friends who were kind of working with hype stuff. And I mean, this is like 2015 when I kind
[06:07.400 --> 06:12.520]  of really released my name as it was. And I just saw people kind of getting successful. And then
[06:12.520 --> 06:17.240]  I stayed in the same spot. And like, I just felt like I was going nowhere. And then all of a sudden,
[06:17.240 --> 06:23.080]  it's just like word of mouth got out. People started running that and some other genetics.
[06:23.080 --> 06:27.560]  And then, you know, it just kind of caught like wildfire. And now here we are. And I mean,
[06:27.640 --> 06:32.360]  luckily, I just I really spend my time and my resources still helping all the patients that
[06:32.360 --> 06:37.720]  I can because that's like, that's why I started doing this. And so I don't really share a lot
[06:37.720 --> 06:42.280]  about what I do in the off time, but it's like all my material and things I don't
[06:43.480 --> 06:48.440]  really go and sling packs or anything. I mean, I donate all my stuff to patients and I give out
[06:48.440 --> 06:54.520]  tons of stuff to cancer patients every month who can't afford it. It's just I mean, this that's
[06:54.600 --> 06:59.000]  what I do. That's why I do this stuff for Leo and everyone else like Nick and just people
[06:59.560 --> 07:03.160]  who have big hearts who have been dealt a shitty hand, man. It's like I've been in that
[07:03.160 --> 07:08.280]  predicament so many times that I'm just honored to be able to be where I am today and to help
[07:08.280 --> 07:13.320]  them in that place. And like that's that's exactly what I want out of life is I just want to be in
[07:13.320 --> 07:18.680]  the position to help others through medicine and, you know, just influence as well. So
[07:18.760 --> 07:20.040]  that's a little ramble about me.
[07:22.040 --> 07:23.160]  Super cool, man.
[07:28.120 --> 07:31.000]  So should we go ahead?
[07:31.000 --> 07:31.560]  No, go ahead.
[07:33.320 --> 07:35.000]  I was going to say, should we get into it?
[07:35.000 --> 07:35.560]  Let's do it.
[07:35.560 --> 07:39.730]  I was going to say something to say before we get into it.
[07:39.730 --> 07:40.210]  Let's do it.
[07:42.770 --> 07:47.970]  All right. So you want to start with boom, the bonsai punch.
[07:48.050 --> 07:56.130]  Let's do it. So that is Leilani Mellon. Leilani Mellon was actually from
[07:57.410 --> 08:03.970]  it's across from Triple Five Genetics, who became West Valley Genetics, formerly known as Gonzo,
[08:04.690 --> 08:09.410]  who from the medical days, a lot of us respected his genetics were like some of the first
[08:09.410 --> 08:16.770]  super fire seeds that I actually phenotyped. And so I'm going to start with the bonsai punch.
[08:18.930 --> 08:25.330]  So I was able to find a really melon smelling Hawaiian dominant plant that grew relatively fast.
[08:26.290 --> 08:30.530]  So that's the mother cross. And then the garlic punch mill that I use on pretty much all the
[08:30.530 --> 08:37.970]  crosses for those adds a little bit of coloration to his antho heavy, super recessive in nature,
[08:37.970 --> 08:43.970]  but it also kicks up THC and structure on all the plants. So that's super turpy. I mean,
[08:44.050 --> 08:51.970]  it yields moderate to heavy. It responds really well to topping. I mean, see green relatively well,
[08:51.970 --> 08:56.290]  but I tend to run it in a multi topped environment like large, large pots. I mean,
[08:56.290 --> 08:59.410]  I usually run 20 gallons, 20 to 30s on those. And
[09:02.130 --> 09:03.090]  do you have that? How you run?
[09:05.010 --> 09:05.570]  Well, go ahead.
[09:05.570 --> 09:09.490]  I was going to say your medium is it mostly big, big pots like that then?
[09:09.730 --> 09:15.810]  It is beds. Yeah. So I have some four by two grassroots, you know, line beds that I tend to
[09:15.810 --> 09:22.050]  run with trellises. And then I have a few larger pots that I tend to recycle and just kind of
[09:22.050 --> 09:27.170]  transplant things through and through in flower. And then I have another section where I run
[09:27.730 --> 09:33.490]  basically a modified cocoa, like a living cocoa to where I kind of do some Gannix as well,
[09:33.490 --> 09:36.370]  just because I have a lot of friends with nutrient companies that I like to test for
[09:37.250 --> 09:42.450]  and get baselines. So I just, I like to have the best of both worlds. That's why
[09:42.450 --> 09:46.690]  in some of the photos, they, they are, you know, super beautiful. It's,
[09:46.690 --> 09:51.010]  it's a lot of synganix and running nutrients they do, but it's like my personal opinion,
[09:51.010 --> 09:56.290]  all my personal smoke comes from the beds or the 20 gallon pots. That's like all my personal stuff.
[09:57.010 --> 09:58.530]  So that's what you're seeing on those ones.
[10:00.530 --> 10:03.250]  Are you, what are you doing when for amending your beds?
[10:03.650 --> 10:07.330]  I usually just buy amendments right now. Like I don't really have the space. I'm
[10:07.330 --> 10:11.410]  unfortunately in a smaller location to where I don't have like the ability to kind of close my
[10:11.410 --> 10:16.770]  own loop. So I've just been doing like all the mountain compost. A lot of time I've ordered
[10:16.770 --> 10:22.770]  stuff from build a soil just when I can't make it, but I still tend to make my own, you know,
[10:22.770 --> 10:30.610]  emos, FPJs, owns, I mean, things of that nature that I can just things like fish amino acids,
[10:31.330 --> 10:35.650]  things that stink really bad. My wife won't let me mess with like some compost, you know,
[10:35.650 --> 10:40.290]  I do add my own compost and some castings and things, but when it comes to like
[10:40.290 --> 10:43.170]  having to grab, you know, it's usually Ollie mountain.
[10:45.650 --> 10:46.150]  Oh yeah.
[10:47.730 --> 10:54.970]  But then I tend to throw a cover crop and, you know, just kind of cycle through,
[10:54.970 --> 10:59.050]  throw some hay on top of it and then yeah, make my own EM one as well.
[10:59.610 --> 11:02.650]  Do you hand water or do you use a, an emo?
[11:02.650 --> 11:04.890]  Or do you use an aeration system?
[11:05.690 --> 11:10.730]  No, I do a mixture of both. So, I mean, I have, I have a watering system, but a lot of times I'll
[11:10.730 --> 11:14.970]  add as well. So I'll just have, you know, my base water and coming from that. And then I'll
[11:14.970 --> 11:19.210]  hand water in my nutrients or feeds teas, things of that nature.
[11:25.330 --> 11:29.650]  And all your selections are, are indoors, right?
[11:29.650 --> 11:34.450]  Correct. Yeah. Most of these. So a lot of the outdoor stuff I have isn't picture.
[11:35.570 --> 11:39.650]  There's a few things I do outdoors, but I haven't for the past year and a half.
[11:42.370 --> 11:45.010]  HPS led highlight
[11:45.810 --> 11:50.930]  everything, man. So I've converted everything over to LEDs currently, but a lot of these are
[11:50.930 --> 11:57.250]  like, so I had CMH is three 15s for a while. I switched to six thirties. I kind of got some
[11:57.250 --> 12:01.970]  heating problems. I ended up blowing some AC units and then humidifiers had brought in. So I
[12:01.970 --> 12:09.650]  switched back down to three 15s. I was running HPSs for a very, very long time. And then I
[12:09.650 --> 12:17.010]  recently converted over thrive. Agritech was nice enough to send me some of their new lights. And
[12:17.010 --> 12:23.170]  man, I switched everything to LEDs the past year. And it's like, I'm still seeing the same results,
[12:23.170 --> 12:29.890]  but in all honesty, like my power bill has, it's been cut down by like a third or half,
[12:29.890 --> 12:32.530]  half a third, something like that. I mean, it was roughly around
[12:33.570 --> 12:37.490]  3,200 a month. No. So it's two thirds down and it's about 1200 now.
[12:40.690 --> 12:41.170]  Oh yeah.
[12:45.410 --> 12:45.890]  Everything's
[12:49.250 --> 12:52.770]  there's a little drag. There's a little lag in our conversation. It's a little difficult,
[12:52.770 --> 12:56.770]  but I just want to get a baseline for folks often ask, you know, where you're selecting,
[12:56.770 --> 12:58.690]  where you're growing and kind of good to get it out there.
[12:59.810 --> 13:05.650]  Yep. Yep. Everything's pretty much indoors for me. I tend to do a lot of vertical growing. So
[13:05.650 --> 13:12.610]  I have racks and things that I'll kind of bring in. I'll do, I do have some T5s still for my
[13:12.610 --> 13:21.650]  racking systems just because the ability to link them. So I'll run, you know, 12 to 16 racks of
[13:21.730 --> 13:26.210]  flats of seeds. And then generally from there, I'll kind of do one round of selections. I'll
[13:26.210 --> 13:30.850]  move those into a small area. And then from there I'll start another selection process
[13:31.890 --> 13:36.210]  after I can kind of dial things in. I tend to call things relatively quickly now, just cause
[13:36.210 --> 13:42.450]  I know what I'm looking for. Unless I'm doing like a large specific phenol hunt or an open pollination.
[13:42.450 --> 13:47.410]  And I'm really kind of looking, you know, for comparison through flower, just to make baseline.
[13:48.370 --> 13:53.090]  But vertical growing is the way I do it just because I don't have a ton of space at the moment.
[13:53.090 --> 13:58.210]  I did prior, but in the past few years we've kind of had to downgrade our space. And so
[13:58.210 --> 14:02.770]  I've had to be super resourceful and just start to use rack and then vertical integration.
[14:05.570 --> 14:10.210]  So have we, have we pretty much covered the bonsai punch?
[14:11.090 --> 14:11.970]  Yeah, I think so.
[14:12.930 --> 14:15.490]  Okay. So up next is the
[14:18.770 --> 14:20.770]  Black Garlic Punch F2.
[14:21.410 --> 14:23.410]  Well, it's actually just Garlic Punch F2.
[14:24.290 --> 14:25.650]  All right. Give me one second.
[14:26.530 --> 14:27.970]  Even though that sounds way cooler.
[14:33.410 --> 14:34.450]  All right. Take two.
[14:35.090 --> 14:36.690]  Garlic Punch F2.
[14:38.530 --> 14:47.070]  So this here is a pride and joy string of mine cultivar. That's what I like to call it. But
[14:47.070 --> 14:50.350]  Garlic Punch was actually something that I just kind of did on a whim.
[14:52.750 --> 15:01.310]  The funny thing is, is I ended up winning a first place floral cup in Oregon last year. I entered
[15:02.270 --> 15:09.710]  a nug. Me and my friend Farmer Fly went down to help sponsor an event that Bio 365 was throwing.
[15:10.350 --> 15:16.430]  And so I went down with some outdoor that I had just, I mean, it was like technically my B grade.
[15:16.430 --> 15:20.350]  I had all my A grade, you know, that I kept for head stash. Sorry guys, but I did.
[15:22.030 --> 15:27.150]  And so I took some stuff. I mean, it was beautiful flower. I ended up bringing it down and entering
[15:27.150 --> 15:31.310]  it in. It was either that or Bueller. And I thought that had a little more bag appeal.
[15:31.310 --> 15:35.790]  And it ended up taking home first place floral category. I was super stoked.
[15:36.510 --> 15:42.510]  Garlic Punch has been consistent through pretty much everywhere in the world for the most. I have
[15:42.510 --> 15:48.830]  friends that have ran it in Spain. Other regions I'm not going to talk about just due to the laws,
[15:48.830 --> 15:53.790]  but Australia, pretty much anywhere around the world. I've had a lot of success on the East
[15:53.790 --> 16:00.590]  coast, Midwest, South America, and then people have been killing it in the Northwest, but
[16:00.590 --> 16:05.390]  specifically, you know, where it was bred, but it seems like out East too. I have a friend who's
[16:05.390 --> 16:11.390]  growing and he's just been crushing it. I mean, he absolutely thinks it's top 10 strings. It is.
[16:11.390 --> 16:19.310]  So it has a lot of beautiful. Yeah. It's got a lot of colorful expressions. Antho heavy. I think it
[16:19.310 --> 16:25.070]  comes from a lot of the slurking, especially the triple, you know, that super frosty look in the
[16:25.070 --> 16:30.830]  structure from the nugs, but the black Afghani, the female, it really kind of gave it this wretched
[16:30.830 --> 16:36.350]  garlic smell. And it gave some of the phenotypes that are assess the phenotypes of a real super
[16:36.350 --> 16:43.390]  colorful fade. Once you get in a flower, I mean, you can get some red, black expressions, pink.
[16:44.190 --> 16:48.590]  There's just, I mean, there's a ton of different colors to be found in it, but all the turps are
[16:48.590 --> 16:54.110]  pretty consistent across. It's got a real heavy garlic punch smell all the way up until about
[16:54.110 --> 16:59.710]  week five. And then it develops like this real weird permanent marker smell. And I just try and
[16:59.710 --> 17:04.830]  tell people, but especially in the cure, you'll get like, if you just take a whiff of a Sharpie
[17:04.830 --> 17:09.710]  and like Hawaiian punch, it's identical to that with some garlic thrown in it. But the garlic
[17:09.710 --> 17:14.830]  kind of comes more out in the cure, especially if you care, correct. And do a long, slow dry on it.
[17:14.830 --> 17:19.230]  If you tend to do a faster dry, like under 10 days, it'll be more pronounced towards,
[17:20.110 --> 17:23.950]  you know, the punch marker smells. But if you can give a nice slow cure,
[17:24.910 --> 17:33.230]  like 60, 55, it tends to be amazing, amazing turps. I mean, it's like one of my favorites that
[17:33.230 --> 17:36.990]  my wife says she'd just wear it as a perfume if we could extract it and put it on it.
[17:37.470 --> 17:42.190]  Matthew 0
[17:42.190 --> 17:46.110]  And then in terms of kind of how it grows and how long it takes to finish,
[17:46.110 --> 17:49.870]  because I know some people are in, you know, some of those Northern environments.
[17:49.870 --> 17:51.790]  Tim Larkin
[17:51.790 --> 17:56.430]  Yeah. So it tends to be more of an, I mean, it can be finished in eight weeks. So
[17:56.430 --> 18:04.910]  some phenos tend to finish in the 55 day range. Primarily I take it to about 63, 66. It does have
[18:05.710 --> 18:13.950]  really extremely well, it does well to mold resistance. So PM, I let it go out here till
[18:13.950 --> 18:21.470]  October last year and it didn't have any mold on it whatsoever. It's super resistant against
[18:21.470 --> 18:27.550]  spider mites, thrips, and then aphids as well. It did well against everything. And I had,
[18:28.990 --> 18:34.350]  yeah, it dumps extremely well in hash as well. That's, I mean, just breaking up nugs for the
[18:34.430 --> 18:41.710]  seeds over trays and sifting. I had so much hash, like from just sift arozen last year. I mean,
[18:41.710 --> 18:45.710]  that's pretty much all I was smoking on just from deseeding that stuff. I mean, it was
[18:46.830 --> 18:52.030]  top 10 of my personal strengths that I've cultivated that, I mean, dumps in hash.
[18:52.030 --> 18:52.910]  Tim Larkin
[18:52.910 --> 18:59.230]  How about just going backwards, we didn't touch on the bonsai punch in terms of dumping.
[18:59.230 --> 18:59.870]  Matthew 0
[18:59.950 --> 19:06.350]  It's not necessarily so. It tends to be like a longer structured plant. Like it's definitely
[19:06.350 --> 19:14.190]  more Hawaiian in nature. It tends to have like a long nug versus the thick little slurrcane
[19:14.190 --> 19:20.190]  cookie style nugs, cake nugs. So I don't necessarily think those wash as well. They
[19:20.190 --> 19:25.870]  tend to do well for BHO extractions or if you break them down. But I think garlic punch just
[19:25.870 --> 19:30.990]  in terms of the way it kind of layers trikes on it, it just washes. Well, I mean, it's in the
[19:31.710 --> 19:38.750]  six to eight range to where like bonsai was 4%. So it's not something I would say washes as well.
[19:38.750 --> 19:44.350]  It tends to be more for flower consumers or if you're going to run large amounts for
[19:45.070 --> 19:49.310]  BHO, then I'd recommend it. But yeah, bonsai is definitely more for head stash.
[19:49.310 --> 19:52.790]  Tim Larkin
[19:52.790 --> 19:56.950]  Okay, let's go back to some visuals.
[19:56.950 --> 19:59.190]  Matthew 0
[19:59.190 --> 20:02.870]  And that I believe was grown out in Vermont by my buddy.
[20:06.750 --> 20:10.110]  And that would be in Spain from Mantis.
[20:13.070 --> 20:17.390]  And as I was saying, you can see just kind of the coloration that tends to get on some of those
[20:17.390 --> 20:25.470]  phenos. They tend to have some beautiful nugs. That's pretty standard. It doesn't necessarily
[20:25.470 --> 20:30.670]  run with color drops. It does give it a little boost. But you'll get color fades on it regardless
[20:30.670 --> 20:33.790]  of temps. Tim Larkin
[20:33.790 --> 20:42.910]  Okay. So next up and people were complaining that my audio was low. So I either yeah, I got
[20:42.910 --> 20:47.870]  to troubleshoot the audio. So that was the Garlic Punch F2. Up next is the Boomer.
[20:47.870 --> 20:50.350]  Matthew 0
[20:50.350 --> 20:56.830]  Boom. So Boomer, actually, you guys are the last one I believe to have stock of this as well.
[20:59.550 --> 21:07.150]  It's been my wife's favorite in terms of anxiety. It tends to work really well in slowing things
[21:07.150 --> 21:14.030]  down. But it is just strictly gas as well. Like I mean, it's like GMO on steroids. It tends to be
[21:14.030 --> 21:20.590]  like a GMO Mac almost. So it kind of has almost that sweet Mac smell to it. But that garlicky
[21:20.590 --> 21:26.030]  funk as well. And it tends to finish quite a bit faster, like in a 60 day range. So you don't have
[21:26.030 --> 21:36.670]  to wait 70 to 84 days. It yields amazingly well, thick, thick, massive nugs. Works well. I tend to
[21:36.670 --> 21:42.990]  run it and see a green for those specifically for clones and tend to get a little bit better of a
[21:42.990 --> 21:49.310]  yield. But they run well multi topped. I mean, pretty much any style low stress training. They
[21:49.310 --> 21:54.990]  respond well, you don't necessarily need trellising, they tend to hold themselves up pretty
[21:54.990 --> 22:00.350]  well. They have strong branching, don't need a lot of extra silica or anything of that nature. So
[22:01.310 --> 22:10.350]  when you just think I was going to ask about the Mac. I'm guessing you did you put the Mac mail,
[22:10.350 --> 22:18.670]  but that on the GMO to make your and then you BX that. So it's actually it's GMO. So I took a
[22:18.670 --> 22:27.390]  cut of GMO and then I found a GMO Mac mail and then hit that to the GMO.
[22:31.320 --> 22:38.840]  Did you was it the Mac? Was it? I guess what I'm trying to get at, like there's two versions of the
[22:38.840 --> 22:43.640]  Mac or two flavors profiles in the Mac. There's the creamier kind of the cut back, you know,
[22:43.640 --> 22:48.760]  caps cut. And then when I run seeds of stuff with I've got that Colombian like that hazy stuff. And
[22:49.480 --> 22:53.000]  for me, I don't really care for that flavor. You went more Colombian.
[22:54.120 --> 23:00.040]  So and there's so the initial parent of it, the Mac type parent to it has kind of a lime flavor.
[23:00.920 --> 23:09.240]  And then the the actual mail to is GMO crossed with GMO Mac. And so that's where
[23:10.680 --> 23:15.560]  the GMO was a cut that I use. And then I use the GMO Mac on that. And then from those seed
[23:15.560 --> 23:21.480]  selections, I use the mail. So it's not just the GMO Mac with a pineapple. And it did more have
[23:21.480 --> 23:28.120]  that pineapple turps. It wasn't the Mac one creamy turps. It was that hazy Colombian for sure. But
[23:29.080 --> 23:33.800]  it wasn't as dominant. And then you can't necessarily tell. I mean, it's more of a
[23:33.800 --> 23:38.680]  recessive profile for this specific like you can't even taste Colombian for the most part.
[23:38.680 --> 23:44.840]  It's definitely more gassy, kind of like a putrid lime with like a pineapple,
[23:45.480 --> 23:52.440]  but not necessarily Colombian. He's I am, you know, like I just I just kind of said,
[23:52.440 --> 23:57.160]  I don't really care for a lot of the hay. But I just ran through a bunch of the Gigi formats.
[23:57.960 --> 24:04.120]  And I actually regret kind of not going back and taking some of those that lead in that
[24:04.120 --> 24:09.960]  direction because they were so complex, really, really complex. And it's like,
[24:09.960 --> 24:13.880]  fuck, there's a lot in there. Like, you know, maybe I could choke down that thing. I don't
[24:13.880 --> 24:18.920]  like for everything else that I do like about it. Exactly. And the thing I found about those is that
[24:18.920 --> 24:25.880]  they tend to yield extremely well for some reason, just on pretty much all the ones that I use for
[24:25.880 --> 24:33.320]  breeding projects. So the Mac five that I found off his first release, it actually was a ninety
[24:33.320 --> 24:39.560]  nine day flower time. But it was like literally the most headstashed flower. And it kind of did
[24:39.560 --> 24:46.680]  have that Colombian smell. But it's like once it cured it, it did not have it was more just a weird
[24:46.680 --> 24:54.680]  pineapple. Cream like it was I don't know, it was it was like the best herbs I found in years. And
[24:54.680 --> 24:59.800]  that's kind of where I pursued the path of like wanting to use Mac was once I found that I found
[24:59.800 --> 25:05.880]  a Mac three, which was like the Mac one, but it just had a shorter flowering time. And then a lot
[25:05.880 --> 25:10.760]  of the stuff I found in like the second and third drops tend to be more Colombian leaning. And so
[25:10.760 --> 25:15.720]  it's most of the stuff I use were in drop one or two, it seems like. And then stuff that was
[25:15.720 --> 25:21.160]  latter I didn't use in the breeding projects. Was there a lot of color in that in that
[25:21.160 --> 25:28.760]  pineapple leaning? Yeah, massive. Yeah. And some of them went crazy amounts of time, though,
[25:28.760 --> 25:33.160]  and that's where it was like harsh to me. And so my thing was to retain that and then
[25:33.160 --> 25:45.000]  just break down that flowering time. Yeah, French orchard, I actually I pulled this this these these
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.080]  seeds out there, just a couple of them, but it was from like that's I was asking about the color.
[25:49.080 --> 25:57.160]  It was one from one of those Colombian leaners that was just dark purple and so, so different.
[25:57.160 --> 26:01.480]  And so I ended up saving. I only have like six beans in here, but I couldn't throw them away
[26:01.480 --> 26:07.320]  because they were so beautiful. They're the darkest seeds I've ever seen. I'm sure you'll find
[26:07.320 --> 26:14.600]  something. Sorry, I just like it when I like I like what I can relate because it helps me learn
[26:15.560 --> 26:18.440]  what's putting in there and stuff. And so I appreciate it.
[26:18.440 --> 26:22.920]  And I ran through a lot of paths. Do you guys agree? Do you guys agree with some of these comments?
[26:24.680 --> 26:30.680]  I know. I don't know. I think the Colombians more. I think maybe in like the second and third run,
[26:30.680 --> 26:36.360]  some people say like there's lemon haze church and I can see it's more pronounced and possibly
[26:36.360 --> 26:43.400]  maybe across pollination and later generations. But like the first line, absolutely not like it
[26:43.400 --> 26:48.760]  was solid in it. There was a little bit of that, a little bit of the Colombian variation, but I tend
[26:48.760 --> 26:54.520]  to think that those are the Colombian leaners. Like it tends to have more of kind of a haze smell
[26:54.520 --> 27:01.000]  and tends to be just longer in structure. It's not so much cookie like we see on the Macklin photos,
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.440]  but it's like super stretched out nugs. And I don't know. I, I personally, I found a lot of
[27:06.440 --> 27:10.760]  heat out of those, but yeah, I found those turps and like, I would say the third job, especially,
[27:10.760 --> 27:17.240]  I tend to found almost kind of like a lemon haze, Jack sort of smell to everything. It wasn't more
[27:17.240 --> 27:26.840]  Durbin, but it was just kind of like, yeah, similar to Jack and Mac off. Sorry.
[27:27.720 --> 27:32.040]  He said we need to have a Mac off. Although now that comments. Yeah.
[27:34.200 --> 27:35.640]  I like that. I like that.
[27:36.040 --> 27:40.440]  I think everybody already went there like a year or two ago. I think literally every breeder used
[27:40.440 --> 27:45.000]  Mac and something or another. So there's Mac off is going on right now, I think.
[27:47.480 --> 27:54.190]  Okay. So, so that, sorry, let me, I'm like looking at the chat too. So that was the,
[27:54.190 --> 27:55.950]  what were we just talking about? The boomer?
[27:56.990 --> 27:57.550]  Yes.
[27:57.550 --> 28:02.190]  Boomer. Yeah. When you said anxiety, my ears perked up because I've been,
[28:03.070 --> 28:07.310]  it has the same issue. We have a lot of anxiety and so it's helpful to have stuff that can calm
[28:07.310 --> 28:07.870]  us down.
[28:08.430 --> 28:15.230]  Not as functional. That's what my wife likes about it is that it is, I mean, you can overdo it, of
[28:15.230 --> 28:19.950]  course, but it's like just going to flower. It's super functional and something about like the
[28:19.950 --> 28:26.030]  lime turps, the Mac tight 80 that I use in it. It's not as heavy as, you know, smoking a shit kind
[28:26.910 --> 28:32.910]  of GMO to where you really just want to chill out for the most part. It's just, it kind of calms
[28:32.910 --> 28:37.870]  her body down and her mind to where she can slow down, especially if she's like getting worked up
[28:37.870 --> 28:42.590]  over things. So I always just be like, dude, go, go boomer, go hit the boomer.
[28:43.390 --> 28:48.110]  I think that's a big, big fucking thing to identify. I mean, there's like so many people
[28:48.110 --> 28:53.790]  in the world that are just riddled with anxiety. So for so many things, it's like, okay, I'm just
[28:53.790 --> 28:59.390]  going to be able to have, you know, have known anxiety strains and we'll help you help people,
[28:59.390 --> 29:02.590]  different people out with it, you know, and you can find the profile of flavors that you like
[29:02.590 --> 29:03.150]  within there.
[29:03.150 --> 29:10.750]  So for those in Washington state, anything you've seen in the retail market that stood out?
[29:10.750 --> 29:21.510]  Oh, I mean, in general, like that, that's the case. And the thing is, it's hard to,
[29:21.510 --> 29:27.270]  I've actually been buying weed in the retail market this summer because everything I had was
[29:27.270 --> 29:40.310]  just seeded. And anyways, everyone is buying weed and repackaging it. So you'll find a brand that
[29:40.310 --> 29:45.270]  has a good line on something and then when it's gone, it's gone and they might have the same name
[29:45.270 --> 29:50.310]  on there, but it's not the same thing. You know, it's just, it's just, it's just a little bit
[29:50.470 --> 29:56.950]  different. So it's been really interesting. I've been doing a lot of talking with bud tenders and
[29:57.830 --> 30:02.230]  kind of figuring out the funny, funniness of it. You know, there's not very many
[30:02.230 --> 30:05.430]  companies out there that just grow their weed and sell their weed.
[30:07.110 --> 30:09.750]  Like everybody's white labeling other people's.
[30:09.750 --> 30:10.070]  Yeah.
[30:12.310 --> 30:17.750]  California too. It's creating brands, right? It's a brand is what dominates, not the.
[30:17.750 --> 30:22.550]  Well, and that's, I was talking to someone who was a bud tender and they run a podcast. They were
[30:22.550 --> 30:26.870]  just here teaching me about bees. They're beekeeper and I got bees this year. And
[30:29.270 --> 30:35.590]  we were just talking about how the market, you know, it, it, it changed when I, in 2017, my
[30:35.590 --> 30:42.950]  first recreation, the whole thing to make fresh, I didn't have drying space and I was just like,
[30:42.950 --> 30:48.150]  right, this is what we're doing. And no one knew what the hell to do with fresh frozen in 2017 in
[30:48.150 --> 30:54.470]  the Washington retail market. They were like, so it gets, it yields half, half the weight.
[30:54.470 --> 30:57.350]  I'm like, yeah, but it tastes way better. Terps are way up, you know,
[30:57.910 --> 31:02.070]  explain it to them. And they had no idea what to do with it. And, and because that,
[31:02.070 --> 31:06.470]  the way that the transition happened, the consumers, which weren't really the, the,
[31:06.470 --> 31:10.870]  the base of all the consumers, but they were the consumers in the retail stores started driving
[31:11.430 --> 31:15.830]  what was being produced. And so these brands got developed and now they're just, they're,
[31:15.830 --> 31:20.230]  they're buying these high THC thing that people are, everyone's just trying to survive. And so
[31:20.230 --> 31:25.910]  everyone's producing slop in Washington state because the retail stores basically told them to.
[31:28.310 --> 31:29.510]  That was my little rant, sorry.
[31:29.510 --> 31:37.590]  So, so this may hit on something that we haven't covered yet, but see that one,
[31:38.470 --> 31:43.110]  Sacramento Valley gets super hot. I assume in August.
[31:45.430 --> 31:51.190]  Yeah, that's my guess too. So you need something that can do 15 days, 105 degrees.
[31:51.190 --> 31:56.630]  So a lot of stuff I test out too. I mean, it really is based on flowering time. If you,
[31:57.510 --> 32:02.950]  you might want to consider running some autos, honestly, but if not just a lot of the stuff that
[32:02.950 --> 32:09.990]  I tend to do that is under 60 days tends to be extremely drought resistant as well. So I tend to
[32:09.990 --> 32:15.670]  do over-watering and under-watering and all my selections and then whatever, you know, basically
[32:15.670 --> 32:22.390]  can withstand every stress that I can throw it at. It goes into the breeding program. So a lot of my
[32:22.390 --> 32:28.790]  cultivars go through, you know, 110 plus degree, whether with no harming or any issues, it's just
[32:28.790 --> 32:33.270]  a matter of you taking care of it, feeding it water early on and, you know, maybe giving it
[32:33.270 --> 32:37.990]  a mist or two through the day. And we touched on this a little bit, but do you want to just talk
[32:37.990 --> 32:45.670]  about the anxiety strains? Yeah, for sure. So Boomer, we were just actually talking about that.
[32:45.670 --> 32:50.870]  It's relatively simple to grow to. That's one of the things I like about is I kind of took
[32:51.750 --> 32:56.390]  some of the problems that people tend to have if you don't get a cut or do it right with GMO,
[32:57.190 --> 33:03.110]  especially towards the end running, you know, later cultivars. It's super simple to run. I mean,
[33:03.110 --> 33:06.550]  you can come up with really good medicine, but once you dial it in, you can really see
[33:07.670 --> 33:12.470]  pronounced features, more resin in it. So you can actually grow along with the plant.
[33:12.470 --> 33:15.990]  That's a beautiful thing about some of these cultivars, especially like Boomer.
[33:18.310 --> 33:22.950]  Hold on. I'm being heckled. Chris Guerrero. I think, did I ask his question? Hold on.
[33:23.510 --> 33:27.840]  Yeah, no, I just, all right. That was the one I just asked. I got you.
[33:29.440 --> 33:32.080]  And then you just answered another question.
[33:35.520 --> 33:41.440]  Good. There are a lot of comments. Some of it, basically someone was asking some, yeah,
[33:41.440 --> 33:46.560]  something easy to grow. I know that was kind of this question. I mean, that was the same.
[33:46.560 --> 33:50.560]  That was the same. All right. Yeah. So that was kind of like also easy to grow. So Boomer is not
[33:51.520 --> 33:56.480]  only for anxiety, but it's also easy to grow. Yep. All right. My God.
[33:58.000 --> 34:04.000]  Two with one. And it dumps, it's a hash dump or two.
[34:04.640 --> 34:09.760]  It is. It actually is. So three with one, there we go. All right. We all know GMO
[34:09.760 --> 34:16.160]  Washington extremely well. So, I mean, it just added to some turps to it. So it's just a variation,
[34:16.240 --> 34:18.400]  but it's still got the resin production from GMO.
[34:20.720 --> 34:29.120]  Whoops. Sorry. And Rob says that he has seen cannabis grow well in the high heat.
[34:29.120 --> 34:34.640]  It tends to stunt growth. I mean, if it's not an optimal temperature, it's a weed, man. It'll grow
[34:34.640 --> 34:41.360]  anywhere. It's just, I've seen some growth, I mean, a hundred degrees for a month straight in
[34:41.360 --> 34:47.360]  California and still grew, you know, five, six pounds of plants. So, but man, honestly, yeah,
[34:47.360 --> 34:58.800]  for sure. Okay. So we just, that was Boomer. All right. So we are now on Cherry Flow Fighter
[34:58.800 --> 35:05.760]  and that's a one-to-one THC to CBD. Correct. That sounds quite interesting.
[35:06.720 --> 35:16.720]  And there's a lot of lineage here. So Flow Fighter is another cultivar that I created a while back.
[35:16.720 --> 35:24.080]  And so that's going to be a flow and early flow, which is a chocolate Tylenol that was selected by
[35:24.080 --> 35:32.560]  a friend of mine. And then I took it to F3 or F4 before using it with the Starfighter F2 male
[35:33.440 --> 35:39.040]  that I had. And the Starfighter F2 male I've had for many, many years. And so I've used them in a
[35:39.040 --> 35:46.560]  few projects and I just kind of wanted to bulk up the flow. If you look way back, I probably should
[35:46.560 --> 35:51.200]  have said some of the flow pictures that I use in it, but she's amazing, especially the Flow Fighter
[35:51.200 --> 36:00.560]  23 that I use in this particular cross. And so she had really funky chocolate turps, just grew
[36:00.560 --> 36:08.400]  incredibly easily, but it didn't yield extremely well. That was the one downside and with flow in
[36:08.400 --> 36:15.360]  particular, if you guys have grown flow, you tend to know that. In my opinion, I mean, maybe somebody
[36:15.360 --> 36:26.800]  else found a female that does dump or grows huge, but the flow is... Does the chocolate imply kind
[36:26.800 --> 36:33.520]  of a Thai lineage? It is chocolate Thai. It is the Thai lineage. And so super narrow leaf, but
[36:33.520 --> 36:40.240]  it just, it literally smelt like milk chocolate. And so the Starfighter male added kind of like a
[36:40.240 --> 36:47.200]  lemon cream smell to it. And then I found that I wanted to make something more medicinal with it.
[36:47.200 --> 36:56.080]  And so the Cherry Wine Spectrum male that I used, he was pink and purple and he's hemp compliant.
[36:56.080 --> 37:04.160]  And so the whole Cherry Wine line is pretty much hemp compliant. But I used him because he had a
[37:04.160 --> 37:12.080]  higher CBG rating. And so I wanted to get a full spectrum profile basically onto that Flow Fighter.
[37:12.960 --> 37:20.880]  And then it kind of just gave it like a weird cherry lemony chocolate. I mean, it really depends
[37:20.880 --> 37:25.840]  on the pheno that you find from them, but there's a lot of variation and then also a lot of
[37:25.840 --> 37:41.080]  cannabinoid range as well between them. So on the hash front for all the hash heads watching?
[37:41.880 --> 37:49.800]  Not as big a washer. She's more medicinal. Still washes well, 4 to 5%, but again, it's not,
[37:49.800 --> 37:53.880]  it's like a conventional wash and it's not anything that I would write home to for...
[37:54.200 --> 38:06.230]  It's more medicinal. Oh, I'm working on it right now. I have a THCV Varin that I've been working.
[38:06.230 --> 38:14.950]  It's a one-to-one and I should have a one-to-one-to-one shortly once I can get everything
[38:14.950 --> 38:20.710]  stabilized. I've just been having issues with the levels being off to where it's like a one-to-one-to-two
[38:20.710 --> 38:25.110]  or there's just very... And so I'm trying to stabilize that before I release it, but I'll
[38:25.190 --> 38:31.990]  probably let some out. And then some S1s of Doug Varin as well, which is a one-to-one THC and THCV
[38:31.990 --> 38:39.510]  and they're both about 6%. It's not high ranking, but it is medicine. And so it's good for people
[38:40.230 --> 38:43.590]  with seizures or epileptic issues.
[38:44.310 --> 38:53.510]  I'm multitasking. Give me one second. All right. So that was...
[38:56.790 --> 39:01.990]  That was the Cherry Flow Fighter one-to-one and then we have the Cherry Mist.
[39:02.550 --> 39:03.030]  Correct.
[39:04.310 --> 39:09.590]  So I see there's a theme here with it because is the CWSF3, is that also a cherry?
[39:10.230 --> 39:16.870]  It is. Yeah. That's the cherry one, CWSF3. Yeah. So I used him in a few different projects,
[39:16.870 --> 39:23.190]  just the things I kind of found more leaning towards the medical side of things. So
[39:24.150 --> 39:31.030]  the female I used in this specific cross was a pre-98 Cali Mist. For those that don't know,
[39:31.910 --> 39:39.190]  Cali Mist is extremely important for women with menstrual problems. Like it provides
[39:39.190 --> 39:45.910]  extreme relief for menstrual cycles, cramping, things of that nature. I found this out making
[39:45.910 --> 39:52.630]  a bunch of live resin back when I had to collect, like back in 2016 or whatever, and had it dropped
[39:52.630 --> 39:59.270]  off to a collective in Tacoma. And literally every woman like sought after this stuff because it
[39:59.270 --> 40:05.990]  helped out so much. And so I just kind of remembered that and then used that specific pre-98 Cali
[40:06.790 --> 40:11.910]  in it with the cherry wine spectrum to add some CBD and CBG, and then it just gave it a full
[40:11.910 --> 40:17.510]  profile. So this was tailored for the ladies a little bit more so, but I mean, it is medicine.
[40:17.510 --> 40:23.510]  It works for anybody with stomach problems. I tend to have digestive issues due to being celiac. And
[40:23.510 --> 40:28.870]  so it does help with appetite suppression as well, and then bloating. So if you have
[40:29.830 --> 40:37.110]  digestive disorders, things to do with celiac disease and you have stomach problems like me,
[40:37.110 --> 40:42.310]  it tends to work extremely well for edibles, concentrates, tinctures, as well as flour.
[40:42.870 --> 40:46.630]  Just, you know, smoking a little bit of flour, it kind of relieves the bloating as well.
[40:51.640 --> 40:57.400]  So we're going to take rosin from this one and rosin from the Boomer, mix it up.
[40:58.440 --> 40:59.640]  Yeah, milk it into some-
[40:59.640 --> 41:00.440]  Calm down everybody.
[41:01.880 --> 41:09.240]  Yeah, everybody needs to calm the fuck down right now.
[41:09.240 --> 41:11.800]  Nowadays, you're just going to medicate the world a little bit.
[41:13.960 --> 41:21.880]  We got about five days till half the country needs to freak out again and half the country
[41:21.880 --> 41:25.800]  needs to jump for joy. So we need to get moving tonight.
[41:25.800 --> 41:29.560]  In these five days that we can all freak... What's that?
[41:30.520 --> 41:33.960]  So we need to get moving on it tonight and get it into the water supply.
[41:36.600 --> 41:37.100]  Right.
[41:38.440 --> 41:42.440]  Oh shit, in chat, they're getting confused. 502, they thought it was area code.
[41:42.440 --> 41:44.760]  So we're clarifying that it's the-
[41:44.760 --> 41:45.880]  Recreational mark.
[41:45.880 --> 41:49.560]  The I502, short for our recreational cannabis law.
[41:51.720 --> 41:53.800]  So you see the Crohn's comment?
[41:54.440 --> 41:59.080]  Yep, it does. Yeah, Crohn's too. That's another digestive issue I have a lot of
[41:59.080 --> 42:05.560]  friends that deal with. So it tends to work for any immunity disease where you can have problems
[42:05.560 --> 42:10.360]  digesting certain things. Lyme disease as well, if you have allergy issues with certain foods
[42:11.400 --> 42:16.280]  or just eating disorders as well for appetite suppression, it tends to work for that.
[42:21.360 --> 42:25.600]  Sorry, I'm trying to read through the chat.
[42:25.840 --> 42:30.160]  I saw somebody say something about Jack Herrera for anxiety and I talked about this-
[42:30.160 --> 42:30.720]  Yeah, that was a while ago.
[42:30.720 --> 42:31.220]  Yeah.
[42:32.000 --> 42:38.880]  No, my wife cannot do Jack turps at all. It actually sends her into a severe panic attack.
[42:38.880 --> 42:45.680]  And so I talked about this with Doc Calix on his Turping Tuesdays, but I've tend to find...
[42:46.720 --> 42:51.920]  If you find something with a heavy rate of mercine in it, something that will slow most
[42:52.000 --> 42:57.680]  people down, it will tend to kind of pull the anxiety attack down to a manageable state.
[42:58.800 --> 43:04.480]  I tend to give her stuff heavy with mercine, THC dominant, maybe with a little bit of CBD,
[43:04.480 --> 43:06.640]  but definitely not Jack turps.
[43:08.640 --> 43:09.680]  And then do you see that one?
[43:10.400 --> 43:16.080]  Yep, that's what I use every day, sir. I deal with chronic pain. I fractured my neck being
[43:17.040 --> 43:23.520]  a semi-professional snowboarder back in the day. I've had neck fractures, shoulder separations,
[43:24.400 --> 43:29.360]  spinal injuries, knee injuries. I mean, pretty much everything. I've had seven concussions.
[43:30.240 --> 43:32.960]  I've wreaked havoc on myself and I use one-to-one.
[43:32.960 --> 43:39.280]  I don't know how we haven't met before, man. I was big in the snowboard scene. I'm really big,
[43:39.280 --> 43:40.640]  Rome, Snowcon.
[43:42.320 --> 43:45.280]  I was at Evo for years. So I think we talked about this because you were at
[43:45.280 --> 43:49.040]  Snowcon and I was at Evo. So that's where I would have been. Rivalries.
[43:50.880 --> 43:51.200]  Yeah.
[43:54.910 --> 44:01.390]  Okay. So wait, yeah. And let's rewind on that. So you were a professional snowboarder?
[44:01.390 --> 44:06.910]  No, I was never professional. So I did it for the love of it. I never got paid for it. I would
[44:06.910 --> 44:13.390]  always bail on photographers and things like that to go ride powder instead. But I had many,
[44:13.390 --> 44:19.310]  many sponsors that were big, big names. And I competed in major events and placed in some of
[44:19.310 --> 44:25.950]  them. But I just never gave a fuck enough to ever really pursue a paycheck in it. I just wanted to
[44:25.950 --> 44:33.630]  do it more for the love of it. And yeah, it just never really stuck with me. I never collected any
[44:33.630 --> 44:34.510]  money from it.
[44:34.510 --> 44:36.270]  What are some of your favorite mountains?
[44:36.990 --> 44:39.950]  Yeah. I was going to ask, are you a Stevens or a Snowcon?
[44:39.950 --> 44:40.350]  I'm a Baker.
[44:41.070 --> 44:41.710]  You're a Baker.
[44:43.230 --> 44:48.110]  Alpinetall is my stomping grounds. That place has almost killed me more than any other place
[44:48.110 --> 44:53.870]  on the planet. It is terrifying and I love it very much. But I pretty much ride Crystal.
[44:54.430 --> 44:59.470]  That's my daily mountain. I still ride all the time. And then Baker when I can, that's probably
[44:59.470 --> 45:05.070]  my favorite is just going up to the top of Baker and going down to backcountry through the bowl.
[45:05.870 --> 45:12.270]  That's a trip, man. I actually haven't snowboarded in so many years because I got hit by a car and
[45:12.270 --> 45:19.470]  it fucked me up. And I couldn't do this half-ass shit anymore. I was just like, I just need to
[45:19.470 --> 45:24.990]  stop right now. And now I want to kind of get, I'm feeling better. I want to get back into it.
[45:24.990 --> 45:26.990]  But I have like 10-year-old-
[45:26.990 --> 45:28.110]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
[45:28.110 --> 45:32.110]  I have a quiver of snowboards that is brand new, but 10 years old. You know what I mean?
[45:32.670 --> 45:37.150]  So it's like, I'm just kind of, I don't even know why I still have them.
[45:39.070 --> 45:41.150]  Like who has a quiver that's 10 years old?
[45:41.150 --> 45:45.230]  Do you have kids? I can hear a kid in the background, right?
[45:48.580 --> 45:49.540]  I have one. Yep.
[45:50.340 --> 45:56.900]  Yeah. So we need to, I want to do like some, when we can do events again, do some like cannabis
[45:56.900 --> 46:02.900]  industry get together at some mountain where we all just hang out and bring our kids and
[46:02.900 --> 46:10.420]  ski and snowboard and talk shop and get shit done. And I think that'd be kind of awesome.
[46:10.420 --> 46:14.900]  I'm all for that. I'm all for that. I, yeah, let's do it.
[46:16.100 --> 46:19.780]  So you, you see this one, good for thyroid issues.
[46:21.460 --> 46:26.660]  That's one thing I haven't really done much research into. So thyroid in particular,
[46:26.660 --> 46:30.180]  no, I don't have anything that I could recommend off the top of my head,
[46:30.980 --> 46:35.940]  but let me dig into that. And if you shoot me a DM on Instagram,
[46:35.940 --> 46:38.580]  I will look into it for you and get back to you with an answer.
[46:40.660 --> 46:44.740]  And you can DM, you can slide into his DMs right there.
[46:46.100 --> 46:48.820]  If you have a question pertaining to anything medical.
[46:48.820 --> 46:51.460]  I'm at the Congo and I get hit up a lot about the Congo.
[46:52.020 --> 46:57.380]  And I know Kev probably gets hit up a lot about the Congo and whoever else is holding on to it.
[47:00.740 --> 47:08.180]  The answer is for me, I can get it to people who have medical cards in Washington legally. That's
[47:08.180 --> 47:11.940]  what I can do. Cause that's in my, it's in my legal system. And I had to play by these
[47:11.940 --> 47:19.540]  fucking rules. It's really shitty. But I was going to say that a vision creator had made S1s
[47:19.540 --> 47:24.580]  that he's getting out, which is going to be, it's a seed, we can get the seeds out. So hit him up on
[47:24.580 --> 47:30.420]  Instagram. Cause that's like the easiest way. And I know people are weird about S1s, but they did
[47:30.420 --> 47:36.100]  it right. They did it in a, under a university program. And you could take that and continue
[47:36.100 --> 47:40.980]  that generation until you get a good solid seven, eight, you know, and it'd be a fucking cool line
[47:40.980 --> 47:49.380]  to have. So just to answer that. Yep. Zoo Kids has, so it's a black Congolese
[47:49.460 --> 47:56.340]  crossword. Yeah. I have, I have some seeds too. So I'm, I'm a big, getting some seeds out to,
[47:56.340 --> 48:00.820]  you know, process of it. But, um, that's, see, that's the way we can get it out, you know,
[48:00.820 --> 48:04.420]  and people get mad at like, they, they honestly, I mean, you guys probably get this too, but they'll
[48:04.420 --> 48:10.260]  hit you up and be mad. It's like, dude, I don't know you. Like I'm running a business here. Like
[48:11.460 --> 48:16.100]  all the time. Yeah. I love you. I'll give you some seeds.
[48:19.540 --> 48:26.660]  I don't even remember what we were. We just finished the Cherry Flow Fighter or.
[48:28.180 --> 48:31.220]  No, it was the, um, the one with the carry mist. Cherry mist.
[48:32.420 --> 48:37.620]  All right. So we, all right. So that, so we wrapped up the Cherry Mist and now
[48:40.020 --> 48:46.100]  some more Cherry. The Cherry Wine Spectrum. So this is the compliant hemp, uh, Cherry Wine
[48:46.100 --> 48:52.420]  Spectrum. It was, um, so Cherry Wine is the female. And then, uh, the male was just called
[48:52.420 --> 48:58.740]  Spectrum Hemp. Um, and it was, they were both certified hemp that I did, uh, breeding for a
[48:58.740 --> 49:04.980]  hemp program, um, and got certified in the state of Washington. And so I took that to F3. Um, it
[49:04.980 --> 49:11.220]  is legally stable and can be ran in hemp farms, but it does have higher, uh, CBG content. It tends
[49:11.220 --> 49:20.500]  to be beautiful, uh, pink, purple Anthos, uh, super, super fast flowering time. I think usually
[49:20.500 --> 49:26.260]  it's in the 50 days. Um, so 40 to 50 days, I usually call them at about 52 days. I think,
[49:26.820 --> 49:32.660]  um, indoors, they tend to run a little bit longer, but I have random indoors. Um, and they still
[49:32.660 --> 49:39.780]  tend to run a beautiful coloration compliant as well. I've ran them over term and they've never
[49:39.780 --> 49:45.300]  gone over compliancy. So, um, just some of the females tend to have a higher CBG rate. Some have
[49:45.300 --> 49:52.740]  CBC as well. Um, but all are 0.3 or less THC and then anywhere from 14 to 18% CBD.
[49:56.860 --> 50:01.820]  And that's some of the reversals I was doing for S1s. And so that's part of the reversal
[50:02.460 --> 50:09.010]  and see some of the flower sacks coming on, but I will have S1s of that.
[50:09.490 --> 50:11.010]  And can you talk about kind of,
[50:14.560 --> 50:19.200]  Oh no, go ahead. I was just going to say I had S1s that were going to be available somewhat soon,
[50:19.200 --> 50:26.560]  but not until next year. Yeah. I was just going to say in terms of how it grows and
[50:27.200 --> 50:34.400]  so it is, it grows extremely quick. Um, it is very large. It's stretching. Um,
[50:35.200 --> 50:41.120]  I mean, it's kind of a beast. It's not recommended for indoors, but you can for sure. Especially if
[50:41.120 --> 50:47.120]  you tend to top it really well before flowering, um, expect quite a bit of stretch out of it.
[50:48.080 --> 50:54.240]  And it tends to grow very structured, but wild at the same time. So the branching tends to be
[50:54.240 --> 51:00.880]  pretty uniform, but it tends to shoot out pretty far. Um, and it just, that's why I say if you're
[51:00.880 --> 51:05.840]  doing it indoors, at least train it relatively well. I tend to use low stress training and then,
[51:05.840 --> 51:11.200]  um, trellised as well. Otherwise you're going to have your hands full with the plant everywhere.
[51:16.670 --> 51:22.110]  And be careful with ceiling heights as well. If you have, you know, eight to 10 foot ceiling,
[51:22.110 --> 51:27.070]  just make sure to get it in shorter. Um, you don't want to go let it in above four feet because then
[51:27.070 --> 51:34.510]  you're going to be hitting it near light. So. Okay. So up next we have
[51:35.230 --> 51:42.510]  death punch. Oh, my favorite. This is one of my favorites. Um, and so many people.
[51:43.550 --> 51:50.430]  Is this the one we still need to add or was that something else? No, that was the Melvin's.
[51:51.390 --> 51:56.270]  Okay. So this one's up on the site. Okay. Yep. Yep. That one is up and running.
[51:56.350 --> 52:03.150]  All right. So death punch. Oh man. Um, so this is another complex cross that I kind of,
[52:03.150 --> 52:11.630]  everything was created and then put together. So the mother for this is, um, a whole nother cross
[52:11.630 --> 52:17.630]  that I created. It's a blackberry sour cross with pink lemonade, which I still have cuts of. I
[52:17.630 --> 52:22.270]  haven't named that particular cross, but, uh, BBS, which was the one before that,
[52:22.270 --> 52:29.710]  that's super sour CBD F5, which is a one-to-one with sour D turps. Um, and then I crossed that
[52:29.710 --> 52:35.870]  for blackberry Cush, their original Northwest cut. And then that was crossed to an auto two,
[52:35.870 --> 52:41.710]  which was a 20 to one. So that brought it to a one-to-one and then to another one-to-one. Um,
[52:42.430 --> 52:48.190]  then I hit that with pink lemonade, which is purple lemonade, which is a one-to-one.
[52:48.750 --> 52:55.950]  Then I hit that with pink lemonade, which is purple Cush and lemon skunk, um, that brought
[52:55.950 --> 53:01.710]  the THC dominance back out to it. And then I hit it with garlic punch. Um, and again,
[53:01.710 --> 53:06.430]  that brought out more THC dominance with recessive, uh, full spectrum cannabinoids,
[53:06.430 --> 53:14.030]  but the resin content on these things are amazing. Um, it was consistently washing above 7%
[53:14.990 --> 53:20.030]  for hash draws and like, it just, it literally dumps. And it's like one of the foulest gassy,
[53:20.670 --> 53:27.550]  funky turps smells I've ever had. Like it is bag appeal. It's got jar appeal. It's got turps. It
[53:27.550 --> 53:32.430]  yields. It's just, it checks all the boxes. And I mean, if you throw some, I don't know if you
[53:32.430 --> 53:38.110]  have the pictures from some of the nugs, but it's just anytime I've taken nugs off to, um, people
[53:38.110 --> 53:43.550]  and that's cherry wine, I think, but anytime I've taken nugs to people, they're super impressed by
[53:43.630 --> 53:48.750]  it. I mean, it's just like, wait, did I, did I just show the wrong thing? That was cherry wine.
[53:48.750 --> 53:56.030]  Yeah. Oh, all right. Hold on. Keep going. They might be somewhere, but it, yeah, she's a dumper.
[53:56.030 --> 54:00.510]  I mean, she, she works well for any kind of growing environment. Um, again, it's something
[54:00.510 --> 54:07.710]  that I've spent a few years on. So, uh, the mother was selected from like a few thousand seeds
[54:08.430 --> 54:14.430]  from this for the BBS times PL. That's something I never really let out. And so I actually did a
[54:14.430 --> 54:21.470]  full selection of that particular mom. There we go. That's her. And, um, I mean that particular
[54:21.470 --> 54:27.870]  plant is amazing. There's one facility that I gave a cut to that might be running some flower,
[54:28.430 --> 54:33.230]  um, here in the next few months, uh, they're kind of hunting it right now and seeing if it
[54:33.230 --> 54:38.430]  meets their standards. But, um, that mom, I have nothing but crazy things to say about her. I mean,
[54:38.430 --> 54:43.230]  she smells so unique. There's nothing else like her. And then when I hit her with garlic punch,
[54:43.230 --> 54:49.870]  it just added that weird Sharpie punch turps to it. And yeah, I mean, she's super frosty and puts
[54:49.870 --> 54:56.190]  out, I mean, she yields, I, it's one of the better plants that I've created in the past few years
[54:56.190 --> 55:00.830]  that I'm, you know, I personally love it. Like it's something I can't get enough of smoking.
[55:00.990 --> 55:05.310]  I mean, I just, I keep running it and wanting to run more and more. So, I mean, it's something I'll
[55:05.310 --> 55:12.190]  probably keep around for a little bit. And I do have a lot more, uh, pictures of that on my page
[55:12.190 --> 55:18.270]  as well. So there's a lot of the actual, uh, nugs that I showed people. It's fire.
[55:20.110 --> 55:25.960]  You're a hand model as well.
[55:27.640 --> 55:36.640]  Bam.
[55:36.640 --> 55:39.680]  Get the zoom in. Look at that.
[55:40.160 --> 55:40.640]  Look at that.
[55:43.590 --> 55:44.630]  Josh, do you approve?
[55:48.320 --> 55:50.480]  Yeah, it looks beautiful, man.
[55:52.080 --> 55:53.360]  Oh, you know what? Hold on.
[56:08.800 --> 56:12.960]  CBD dominant crosses. Yeah. I'm doing a ton of them. Um, I'm actually just kind of
[56:13.760 --> 56:20.160]  selecting through a few thousand seeds of, um, I just kind of do things a little bit
[56:20.160 --> 56:25.360]  differently now. Like I don't necessarily go by the breeder or the person who create, I mean,
[56:25.360 --> 56:30.880]  I write it down so I know who it's from, but I just kind of throw rows of seeds and I look at
[56:30.880 --> 56:40.240]  the plants and whole, um, I don't weird thing I know. But so from time I've learned that me having
[56:40.240 --> 56:45.600]  all these plans to like breed out these specific things, it never comes to fruition. And so it's
[56:45.600 --> 56:51.360]  like I have so many plans that I've written out for like five years and I'll try and make every
[56:51.360 --> 56:56.320]  single step and I'll get to the, you know, the final step of the breeding. And I never find the
[56:56.320 --> 57:03.040]  specific male or I never find the female with the certain characteristics I'm looking for. And so
[57:04.160 --> 57:10.800]  I tend to say like the moment I stopped hunting for specific things and just started hunting as
[57:10.800 --> 57:16.000]  a general, like I have scientific outcomes that I want to reach and I have them written down,
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.240]  but it's like the way I'm going to do it is completely a different approach. And so I just
[57:20.240 --> 57:25.360]  pop a ton of everybody's stuff that I have. So CBD crosses, whether it's mine or it's been gifted
[57:25.360 --> 57:31.200]  to me or, and I'm just going through everything. And so whatever plants I find, um, I'll have them
[57:31.200 --> 57:37.200]  sent in for analysis. Um, I'll be given baselines and then I can kind of figure out what cannabinoids
[57:37.200 --> 57:43.440]  I want to incorporate to them. Um, what profiles I want to incorporate, like where I want them to
[57:43.440 --> 57:47.920]  fit in. And so it's like, when I kind of get that profile, then I can see whether or not it's
[57:47.920 --> 57:53.360]  something I'm going to work with in the future. Um, sometimes I'll go all that way. I'll spend
[57:53.360 --> 57:57.600]  two years with a plant to find out it's something that I'm like, man, there's nothing I really have
[57:57.600 --> 58:03.040]  planned for it. So I might keep a cut of it for a year or two and pass it on to somebody who needs
[58:03.040 --> 58:08.640]  it. But I have things that, you know, I won't even run as well. So it's, it's just a weird process
[58:08.640 --> 58:12.880]  for me, like trying to write things out and saying, well, I'm going to cross a with B and it's
[58:12.880 --> 58:17.600]  going to equal C mother nature always says, fuck that shit. I'm not going to let you do that.
[58:17.600 --> 58:22.640]  She's like, you're going to F and then you're going to go back to B and then you got to go to Z
[58:22.640 --> 58:28.240]  and then come back to a, to get to C. So that's, I learned the hard way and that's just kind of how I
[58:28.240 --> 58:32.640]  do things. Now I don't necessarily go and say, well, I'm going to pop 10 packs of this. I'm
[58:32.640 --> 58:36.320]  going to choose the best one. Well, a lot of time I do that and I don't find the best one.
[58:36.320 --> 58:41.280]  So it's good to have a multitude of other things to look beyond that and say, okay, well, I didn't
[58:41.280 --> 58:46.560]  find that, but this could work because it has similar lineage. And that's just kind of why my
[58:46.560 --> 58:51.200]  lines are so, if you look into them, there's a lot of line breeding I tend to do is because
[58:51.200 --> 58:57.120]  lineages will meet up to kind of create stability and polyhybrids. That's just a quick way to say it.
[58:58.120 --> 59:04.560]  So this comment applies to you. So just take a gander.
[59:04.560 --> 59:12.160]  Dave the Homer, thank you. I appreciate that.
[59:14.480 --> 59:17.840]  It does take time if you don't realize if you have bid on these, we will
[59:19.680 --> 59:23.360]  get your stuff out to you. It just, it takes time to do everything, make sure the payment's been
[59:23.360 --> 59:27.760]  made, package it and then double check before we ship it out to make sure that we don't ship it to
[59:27.760 --> 59:32.400]  the wrong person because it's happened before. So it's just to ensure you get your package,
[59:32.400 --> 59:37.280]  you will get them. It just takes a week or two. It's not like we're just going to be like, okay,
[59:37.280 --> 59:43.520]  you're done tomorrow. We're getting 70 orders out automatically. It takes a week or two for us.
[59:43.520 --> 59:45.280]  So just be patient. We'll get your stuff to you.
[59:51.040 --> 59:57.440]  Just going to say, I keep telling people, put your mailing address in as if it's really
[59:57.520 --> 01:00:03.680]  important that this gets to you because people will send me their mailing address all in lower
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:14.240]  case on one line with Lane Court Avenue abbreviated to like LCA. And I'm just like,
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:23.280]  make it easy for the person who puts stuff up, but like this guy right here, when he gets your
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:30.560]  address and he has to decipher it and try to figure out if like C means court or L means lane
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:41.440]  or like, it's like chicken scratch. That would be super helpful if you made it easy for him to ship
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:48.400]  you what you just won. Yeah. I was also going to say the process, it's hard to understand until
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:54.720]  you've done it. But if you do a night of auctions and you have 50 packs that you have to deal with,
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.640]  we don't necessarily hold those packs. So we're being the middleman on that. So someone pays,
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:14.320]  I get verified. Writing down all the packs, who bid on it, what they did, and then who paid. And
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.440]  then you had to get their address. Then he's got to get that information over to the person that
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:24.560]  holds the packs. So the person that maybe donated the packs, like myself, maybe four or five packs,
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.920]  I don't want to have Rob hitting me up every 20 minutes. Like, here's another address. Because
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.320]  I'm like, we're all doing work. So it's best that if he sends me, here's the packs all at once.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:40.800]  So we have to wait for that last dude to pay. So there's just a lot of fucking
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:46.560]  shit that's going on. Something like that is how it happens. It's a mess.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.640]  That we're dealing with. And we're just trying to clean it up.
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.840]  **Rob Starks** For every hour of fun live auction time,
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:59.840]  it's multiple hours of post auction administrative duties.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.320]  **Jason Vanderhoof-McGill** Yep. Yep. Well put.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.640]  **Rob Starks** Lawrence, who's Ninja? But
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.720]  Lawrence said you have to let Ninja's wife handle it.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:19.920]  **Lawrence Wilkerson** Will? I know Ninja. If it's Dojo C, I'm pretty sure that's who he's talking
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.720]  about. **Rob Starks**
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:26.640]  Now, Dave, we know. We appreciate the comment, though, because I agree. That's why I said when
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:35.680]  we first started, he's been on almost every day doing benefit fundraiser stuff. And he doesn't
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:42.080]  get paid for any of it. And even when he goes off air, how long does it take to ship seeds to
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:48.880]  people who you're just getting their contact info for the first time? And you got to go to the post
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.000]  office. **Jason Vanderhoof-McGill**
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.680]  Yeah, get everything figured out. And Dave, you've been good, man. You've been extremely
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.560]  awesome throughout the whole process. So I appreciate you as well. He's been bidding on
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:03.040]  everything and there every night. **Rob Starks**
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:09.520]  This one's important, too. Yeah, man. It's like the people shipping the packs probably have a
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:15.760]  fire. I mean, when the fires were rampant, they probably had a fire two miles from their house.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:25.120]  **Jason Vanderhoof-McGill** Yep. Appreciate it. Just try and treat everybody the same. I mean,
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:30.080]  we're all in this together. And it's like, man, I'm just tired of the way everyone treats each
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:35.840]  other nowadays. So ELE, everybody love everybody. **Rob Starks**
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.200]  And that's you. Can you read that? **Jason Vanderhoof-McGill**
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:44.240]  One to ones. Hemp is cheap to reproduce tax and THC expenses. It's cheaper out just to mix
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:49.680]  them one to ones. Yep, it is. **Toby Hall**
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.240]  Have you dabbled into CBG at all? **Jason Vanderhoof-McGill**
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.120]  I have. Yeah, I have some CBG stuff. It's just been so...
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.680]  I have a friend out here, Hoku Seed Company, and he's been dealing with it as well. And
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:05.440]  it's just playing with the stability of it. Like when you tend to get to the next generations,
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.600]  THC plays the dominance again. And so you have to really do your selection and get it to F3,
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:17.200]  F4 before you really start releasing it. And so I do have some CBG auto FEMs and some autos
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:23.120]  and stuff that I was planning on releasing relatively soon. But it's just, I mean,
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:28.960]  I was kind of waiting to see how the hemp market played out this year in terms of, you know,
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:34.000]  what people were cropping and what the prices were for hemp and CBG as well,
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.600]  because those were the two major outlets for hemp this year.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.080]  **Toby Hall** Yeah, I just got a...
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:45.360]  **Jason Vanderhoof-McGill** I do. So, favorite terps or strains you've noticed
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:54.320]  high in terps? Oh man, man, it changes all the time. It really depends on like what ailment I
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.680]  have. And I really let my nose kind of decide that for me. And that's what's sad about the
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:04.560]  recreational market is that we can't smell the medicine because half the time you get something
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:09.040]  home and it smells like shit and it pisses. I literally, I'll throw weed on the wall. Like I
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:13.600]  get so mad if somebody says it's something and I've grown it and it smells nothing like it.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.720]  Then I'm like, fuck this. This is not right. So, I mean, it really depends on mood. Like,
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:23.920]  I mean, sometimes I like, I personally like, I like to try a lot of the hype flavors and just
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:30.240]  kind of get a feel as to what people are looking for and why they're looking for it. But personally,
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:38.160]  I just love gas, man. Like I love gas and my thing is like burnt rubber, like the old sour D
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:45.280]  of the two thousands that smelt like straight gasoline, petrol and burnt tires. Like I have
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.840]  been looking for that cut and that smell for so long, just straight burnt rubber.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:06:01.950]  I'm a, I'm a big fan of gas. Like gas is my number one original cherry wine. Um, I'd have to look
[01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:05.870]  into that too. That's something, if you just send me a thing, I can look, I can pull up the
[01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:10.510]  information from my notes. I'm sure I have, there's a few different people that have claimed it, but I
[01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:15.950]  can look through and see who the original breeder was. I mean, I have stock from a few different
[01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:23.950]  breeders back in like 2014 and 13. So, um, I'll look on the packs and just shoot me a message and
[01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:37.550]  I'll get to you about that. Okay. So we were just on Death Punch, right? Correct. So this is what we
[01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:48.880]  just wrapped on and this... Garlic Punch. No, that was the first, the second one I think we
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:55.280]  went to the F2. All right. So we already went through that. Yes, we did. All right. So let's do
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:10.560]  the, the Mace Windu and it's a M-A-C-E Windu. It's the Dude on Star Wars, Samuel L. Jackson's
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:16.960]  character. The purple lightsaber. That's why technically it's the guy who holds the purple
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:26.400]  lightsaber. Oh, that's an F2, right? So hold on. Yes, sir. Yep. And so that's a lightsaber F3 and
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:38.320]  lightsaber originally was bred by Exotic. So it's an F3. Yep. Oh, not an F2. No. So this one's an
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:45.920]  F2. The lightsaber is F3 that I used into it. So I found a lightsaber that I was working with.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:51.360]  And then I found a Predator Pink dominant version of it just because that's another
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:57.840]  strain that works with my wife's anxiety. And so that lightsaber I bred to an F3.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:05.040]  And then I found a male, which was the Hell's Angel Lavender used in this cross.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.920]  He was relatively special. Anything from that line in particular, he tested it on like eight,
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:17.760]  almost 9%, I believe it was for a male. His resin production was off the charts. And then
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:24.160]  he actually had almost 2% terpenes. Like he was the most insane male I think I've had in the past
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:31.120]  two and a half years. And so I ran, I only had 65 seeds that were gifted to me from
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:38.960]  a member from the Hell's Angel. He was from Northern California chapter. And his son,
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:44.400]  he handed them down to his son who was no longer into growing when he passed away. And so
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:50.160]  he handed all the rest of his seeds and then his son contacted me and asked if I wanted to purchase
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:54.800]  his library. And so of course I was like, hell yeah, I'm going to buy this. I went down and
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:02.400]  ended up grabbing those and running all of them. And the ones I found smell like a straight lilac
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:08.720]  lavender plant. And like I said, produced insane amount of resin for a male specifically.
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:16.960]  I used him on the lightsaber and then the progeny was this Mace Windu. And so the first generation
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:22.560]  I found, it was weird is because it smelt like a French horror in the room. Like I can't, and
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:28.960]  that's why I say French horror turps. Like it's like a real foul kind of a retro
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:38.000]  French perfume almost. I mean, it's hard to describe. And so I really bred her for just
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.760]  being the nastiest, stinkiest horror turps I could find. Like perfumey, took her to F2. And
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:52.560]  then from those I was able to find just, I mean, a vast amount of the plants resembled the F1
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:57.680]  generation had those nasty turps. Some of them had kind of more of a pink heavy smell to them,
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.560]  but a lot of them, that's the easiest way to describe it was just like French horror perfume.
[01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:12.070]  That's what I called it. And it just kind of stuck, but they tend to yield a relatively well,
[01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:19.430]  larger dense nugs require a little bit more trimming. They tend to be a little more leafy,
[01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:27.110]  larger structured, washes in the 5% range. But again, this is more for boutique flower
[01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:34.630]  specifically. It does really well for BHO production, just producing extreme nasty turps,
[01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:40.470]  something different. But in terms of washing, I don't necessarily wash this plant. I do more
[01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:43.670]  garlic punch, things of that nature, death punch, the punch,
[01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:50.630]  not necessarily the lavender lines as much. They tend to be more for connoisseur flower for BHO.
[01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:06.750]  Fishy, no, no. It's like the perfume. Like, no, the, if you were to go back in like 1800s,
[01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:12.030]  1700s Paris and being a, I guess it would smell like fish. So I guess that's not a good analogy,
[01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:18.190]  but yeah, just like old perfume, like old whores perfume, like French, a French whore.
[01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:21.070]  That's all I can say. It's not.
[01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:28.830]  I remember going, I live in LA and I went, don't ask me why I was there, but I went to Kim
[01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:36.190]  Kardashian's perfume launch. And one of my friends, she like, you know, you smell it and she
[01:11:36.190 --> 01:11:41.150]  goes, this smells like cheap whore. That's exactly what I was thinking.
[01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:47.790]  Yeah. Here we go. The perfume is covering up the fish smell.
[01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:55.390]  Yup. Exactly. None of the fish smell. Yup. It smells like your mom's purse if your mom had
[01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:58.830]  weed in it. So if your mom carries weed, then exactly.
[01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:14.680]  Okay. Let me, let me throw some more. All right. I think that was asked of the pitchers.
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:26.180]  Yes, sir. I just came back from taking my kid to Great Wolf Lodge. And so I was like trying to get
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:30.980]  back and get the pictures over as fast. And it's like, man, I have so many pictures in my catalog.
[01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:35.460]  I got a new phone and I have to organize everything again because everything got messed
[01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:41.220]  up on it. So I got my work cut out for me between shipping everything to people and
[01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:44.500]  reorganizing my phone. I'm going to be busy the rest of the week. That's for sure.
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:56.700]  All right. So we had a let's do the cultivation tips interlude.
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:00.940]  If I can find it because it was a while ago.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.000]  Somebody said when they're talking about, yeah.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:15.720]  I'm scrolling through all the French whore perfume comments.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:20.360]  But, but, but someone actually had a grow question.
[01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:34.170]  Someone was talking about Denefem. What happened with Denefem?
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:40.740]  I'm not sure.
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.060]  Were they in the news recently?
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.180]  Think something to do with their bank, with their seed bank?
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:56.340]  Someone, I saw someone said in the comments, something about Denefem and Humboldt Seed Company.
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:57.780]  Oh, here we go.
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:11.870]  Boom. You see that, right?
[01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:18.990]  What type of nutrients and amendments do I like to use when making seeds? Probiotics. So
[01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:24.990]  all my seed making stuff. So I'll run synganics or, you know, cocoa based stuff for
[01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:30.590]  flower purposes, just for pictures for the most part, or just testing friends, nutrient lines.
[01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:34.030]  But I tend to use all organic.
[01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:39.710]  I try to source whatever I can. If I can't source it, I'll order it from build a soil
[01:14:39.710 --> 01:14:42.510]  or from a few local places as well.
[01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:50.030]  Just local organic stores. I mean, things that I can't make anymore, like fish amino acids.
[01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:54.750]  My wife almost killed me last time I did that in the garage and she could smell it all the
[01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:58.430]  way in her house. And so she said never again until I get a shed way away from the house.
[01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:05.870]  There's things like that that I can't do. I do have a few, you know, compost, but I can't do it
[01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:12.190]  on a scale that I would like to. So unfortunately I have to buy compost to re-amend. I tend to use
[01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:15.310]  certain cover crops depending on the time of the year.
[01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:25.070]  Make my own EM1, my EMOs. I tend to do those as well. Still I have rice boxes.
[01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:33.710]  FPJs, fermented fruit juices, own. Other than that, I mean, I make pretty much everything I can,
[01:15:33.710 --> 01:15:37.230]  but I tend to just buy, I'd say fishing,
[01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:42.190]  and things like that. So I try and make it possible.
[01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:49.870]  So like silica, if I need silica, I'll tend to use hortusel. I'll go out and forage for it. But
[01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:53.470]  it's just finding what plants you can find locally that will fit.
[01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:59.470]  Nutrient values that you're looking for. I tend to grow a lot of comfrey,
[01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:04.750]  aloe, things of that nature, just as companion plants, just because we tend to use them.
[01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:11.550]  Aloe for rooting. So if you don't use rooting compounds or you don't want to use an organic
[01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:18.110]  method, you can always use that for salicylic acid. It's just found you can cut the aloe off
[01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:24.270]  and just physically put your roots directly into cutting. Store them away in a baggie and then
[01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:28.670]  put them in your cloner if you need to. Occasionally I'll use aloe powder for a dip, but
[01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:35.230]  I mean, coconut powder, that's something I'll buy as well, but I tend to use like aloe flakes,
[01:16:35.230 --> 01:16:39.630]  things of that nature. Again, things that you can buy at Build a Soil. If I can't source it or find
[01:16:39.630 --> 01:16:44.990]  it, if I can't find kelp, bring the ocean or forage for it. I'll buy kelp amendments, things
[01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:49.950]  of that nature. But I just tend to follow my plants. I mean, you just kind of have to build
[01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:59.540]  your soil. What brands do I use? Then I tend to use just whatever's Omri listed. I mean,
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:05.780]  I don't necessarily look. I just look for what nutrient values and who has it organically. So
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:14.480]  it's like, I don't necessarily look for a specific brand. Did you see this one?
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.720]  Limited release. You auctioned off in the benefit the other night.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.560]  The Affy Taffy.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.960]  He's done many benefits over the past.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:28.880]  I think if you're referring to the Affy Taffy. So the Affy Taffy was a polyploidy that I picked
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:34.240]  out. And so I did a really, really large hunt over the last few years for the Affy Taffy line. It's
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:44.800]  fun. And I found one polyploidy self-topping male or female that I used in the carafe. So I picked
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:51.600]  two females. I chose the number 40 and the number 140 and the number eight. And one was a mutant.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:57.760]  The other was basically a perfect reflection of just being an Afghan, heavy Afghan smell with a
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:03.840]  light orange kind of hint. But the other one was just a freak, like the way it grew itself topped.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:09.760]  It did all kinds of weird thing. It had a polyploid stem mutation. And so I used that.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:16.560]  And when I got it in a flower, I noticed that it stretched like crazy. The turps on it were
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:22.880]  like the foulest orange gas turps I've ever smelled. And it just it became something special.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:29.920]  And so I ran it again and then found, I mean, the next run of it was like, it blew my mind. And so
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:35.680]  after that, I kind of went back and looked at the seed stock. And unfortunately, it did not make a
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:42.720]  lot of seeds. And so I'm only able to release a very, very, very, very limited amount. And that
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:48.080]  was for one of the packs of those. So you got very lucky on those, my friend. It's not something I'm
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:55.280]  going to release readily. And it's a few years worth of work that came down to a hundred seeds.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.640]  And that's what I was talking about, how you make plans for things. Sometimes it just,
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.640]  it doesn't play out in our favor, unfortunately. Like I can plan that my pollen is going to take,
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:07.040]  but I stored it and maybe I got, you know, some moisture on it. I don't know necessarily, but
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.160]  just nature has her say in things. So only a few people will be getting these particular
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:22.880]  seeds and you are one of them. So we covered the mace windu. I see just in my notes, Melvin,
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:27.200]  clone and 1Z. Why don't we hit the 1Z and then you can talk about the clone.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:37.520]  So go for it and I'll cue it up. It's 1-Z, right?
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.120]  Yes, sir.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:40.800]  Like one ounce.
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:58.180]  Yep. With an F2 at the end. 1ZF2. That's the one.
[01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:13.310]  Yeah. Why don't you hype it up and I'll cue up the pictures.
[01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:17.870]  All right. Sounds good, man. All right. So this was another,
[01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:23.790]  this was actually one of the things I kind of planned. And so I was looking at the one,
[01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:28.430]  which is a beautiful plant. If you guys don't know, it was created by Clackamas Coot.
[01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:34.830]  It's something he's held very tightly for many, many years. And I had a friend who is a friend
[01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:41.390]  of his that let me get one when he was very sick for me helping him out. He rewarded me with a cut
[01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:48.830]  of it. And so I really found the plant special, but I felt like to introduce it into the market.
[01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:52.830]  And I know Coot was kind of against that. He wanted it to be something special. And so
[01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:58.990]  I really wanted to kind of give it more of a basis, you know, something to where the hype
[01:20:58.990 --> 01:21:05.550]  growers would like to grow it. Just something for everybody. And so I was hunting through a
[01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:14.910]  dying breed pack and I found this killer Z cubed male that he just pretty much promoted the Z-terps,
[01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:20.510]  but he just really promoted growth as well, which is not something that's generally
[01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:27.390]  attributed to the Z. And so he just, he was a special pack, man. I mean that, that dude,
[01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:33.310]  he was only used in one particular cross, which was this one, because it's like all the pollen I
[01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:38.830]  had stored up, I wanted to make sure I had enough seeds to do a large hunt just because I had so
[01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:44.670]  much confidence in this particular cross for the F1s. And so when I made them, I just found like
[01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:50.430]  literally the most amazing plants that I had found in a while. And so my friend Farmer Fly,
[01:21:51.150 --> 01:21:56.510]  he helps me hunt things. He kind of came over and checked things out and he was blown away by the
[01:21:56.510 --> 01:22:02.510]  crosses as well. And so I sent a bunch of stock home with him to kind of help through and he ended
[01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:08.750]  up going through a lot of seeds as well and finding another special male. And this male,
[01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:14.270]  he was put outside for like a year. He'd been beaten down from the winter. He'd gotten through,
[01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:20.990]  I mean, the crop was killed by thrips, aphids, all kinds of different pests, and he just bounced
[01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:27.070]  everything off of it. He re-vegged on the drop of a dime. I mean, he had no problems and that's
[01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:34.510]  something I look for in males particularly is just their regenerative ability, like how fast
[01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:40.270]  they can regenerate. And it tends to be if they re-veg at a faster rate, they just tend to be
[01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:44.670]  more stable in their offspring. Like the ones that tend to go slow, you have a little more instability
[01:22:44.670 --> 01:22:51.390]  in the lines down the road. And so he's just shown nothing but promise. And we used him,
[01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:56.830]  created the F2s and then I did a selection from those and found what you guys saw, just mass
[01:22:56.830 --> 01:23:03.550]  amounts of frost, frost monsters that yield well. It has old school meets new school. So a lot of
[01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:10.270]  them have that Afghan Thai smell, but with like a Z heavy influence. It clones extremely easy. I mean,
[01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:16.270]  it produces really well in any type of environment and any type of person can grow it. Like anything
[01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:20.350]  from a novice where you have no experience, you can put it in, still get a great product, but it's
[01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:27.870]  it will be rewarding to people who know how to grow even more just because you can pump this
[01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:33.630]  one full of resin. I mean, especially if you're running rock wool or cocoa and you tend to run
[01:23:33.630 --> 01:23:38.910]  nutrients. I mean, you can, these are heavy feeders, like you can run consistently in the high 2s.
[01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:46.990]  I mean, constantly, like they're just, they're heavy feeders. Organics, I mean, just kind of
[01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:52.750]  got to watch the plant and feed the soil for the most part, but they do well in any type of growing
[01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:57.870]  format. I mean, I've never had any issues with them. Powdery mildew, I let them go out till
[01:23:57.870 --> 01:24:04.270]  they were frozen over, brought them in, no mildew whatsoever. I tried to run them with no fans and
[01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:09.870]  not a human environment with, you know, 80 to 90 and everything that got mold or mildew. These did
[01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:17.630]  not. So, I mean, they're real stable plants that I just, I really was surprised it took so long for
[01:24:17.630 --> 01:24:22.110]  people to kind of hop on board with them because I was finding such amazing things. I think people
[01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:28.590]  just didn't realize what they were. And funny thing is, is I put a picture up of this maybe a
[01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:34.670]  year and a half ago and somebody named it on Instagram. They were the ones to where I put the
[01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:39.070]  one crosses E cube. And I said, Oh, what would this be? And they said, onesie sounds cool. I
[01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:42.910]  love when people do that. So, thank you. I appreciate you helping me name this.
[01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:52.430]  And Dean is the asshole who, it's already out of stock. Dean snapped up the last pack.
[01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.790]  Smart man.
[01:24:53.790 --> 01:25:00.030]  So, everybody can, Dean, this is, you can, when you fall asleep tonight, this is what you can
[01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:00.670]  visualize.
[01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:06.030]  And that is actually the last pack. So, I'm not restocking these until the F3s are made.
[01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:10.190]  So, we got a question.
[01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:19.550]  Sativa dominant stuff. So, a lot of the, one we're going to get up to lip smackers, lip gloss,
[01:25:20.350 --> 01:25:27.710]  a lot of the suckles stuff. It was a cross from exotic genetics and it was, again, something,
[01:25:27.710 --> 01:25:34.270]  I just pop a bunch of stuff and I ended up finding one particular plant that was labeled
[01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:47.790]  S C K 1 0 1. So, suck 101. And it smelled like creamy sprite, like cookies and cream, but it had
[01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:53.870]  a nasty sprite back into it. And it was, I mean, it was like one of the most impressive plants of
[01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:59.310]  that particular run. And so, I kept her and ended up doing some work on that particular cut with
[01:25:59.310 --> 01:26:04.990]  multiple males. That's going to be definitely the most daytime influence stuff that I think I have
[01:26:04.990 --> 01:26:12.910]  out recently. So, lip smackers, lip gloss. The other one was that cowd, so the one to ones,
[01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:20.750]  those tend to be Sativa dominant crosses. The pre 98 cross with the cherry wine, those are both
[01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:26.430]  going to be Sativa dominant strains. So, but lip smackers is probably going to be your best bet if
[01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:31.390]  you're looking for something Sativa dominant, honestly. And I just actually had a fellow
[01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:38.030]  grower from the Northwest. If you follow him, it's Grum Rummy. He is, he grows out a bunch of gear of
[01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:44.110]  mine and he just got done doing flow mints and lip smackers. And he says this is going to stay
[01:26:44.110 --> 01:26:51.150]  in rotation for the rest of his life. It's beautiful coloration. It finished in 52 days,
[01:26:51.150 --> 01:27:00.670]  I believe. And he went 90% cloudy, 10% amber. So, under 55 days and it's got just, he said an
[01:27:00.670 --> 01:27:09.150]  intricate cinnamon sprite funk smell. It's, I don't even know how to, but he said it was one of the
[01:27:09.150 --> 01:27:13.950]  most exotic plants he's had in quite some time. So, if you go down, pretty much all of these are
[01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:18.510]  all mine. He runs a lot of stuff for me.
[01:27:20.830 --> 01:27:21.710]  Cherry mist.
[01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:24.670]  And that would be the last one that we did.
[01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:27.630]  Lip smacker. There we go.
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:37.040]  Truly, that shit is fire. Would that be a customer testimonial?
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:44.000]  That would be a customer testimonial right there. That shit is fire. And he, so this guy, he's not,
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.640]  he's kind of a novice grower. He's been growing for a few years, but he does a lot outdoors.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:54.480]  And a lot of it's just the genetics on everything. Like he doesn't really do any nutrient programs.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:59.280]  He's doing mild organics. So, just kind of letting the soil finish things. But I mean,
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:02.880]  everything looks phenomenal, especially for, I think it's his second year growing.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:09.050]  A little purple in there.
[01:28:10.730 --> 01:28:16.500]  But if you're into turps, that's what I'm saying. Lip smackers. Just the reason why I called it that
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:20.500]  is just because that's all I could say when I smoked it. Like, it just made me want to like,
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:26.100]  keep smoking it. And especially if you dab like washing and smoking this, like it is,
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:32.900]  you're going to become addicted to it. Like it's habit forming turps. So, I'm just going to-
[01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:38.260]  Yeah. So, if you're washing, here's a closeup of the trichome heads.
[01:28:42.330 --> 01:28:48.330]  And again, very protruding, extended, not super short fat, really easy to wash off.
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:53.860]  But this was more narrow leaf in nature.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:01.280]  It's the flow mint. Back to the lip smacker.
[01:29:10.690 --> 01:29:15.010]  I think pretty much most of those, they're going to be between flow mints and lip smackers
[01:29:15.970 --> 01:29:16.610]  for this year.
[01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:21.490]  So, those are kind of the two that he was running.
[01:29:22.210 --> 01:29:25.410]  Yep. Yeah. He ran a few more, but those are the two he documented the most.
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:44.800]  Lewis, you can go right there.
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:55.270]  Let's go back to the... Right. I like those.
[01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:59.350]  All right. Is Ben still ranting?
[01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:12.350]  Shout out to Fish Whistle as well. Thank you again for helping out, homie, and all the
[01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:16.830]  auctions that we've done recently. I've seen your name quite a bit.
[01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:18.830]  I just want to thank you. I'll have your stuff out soon.
[01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:22.950]  Out of stock.
[01:30:24.630 --> 01:30:31.110]  Afghan Thai turps. So, it's referring to the region like Afghani turps. It's going to be,
[01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:38.070]  I guess, more kind of a kush dominant smell, more Mersing dominant, kind of that dirty,
[01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:46.550]  sock, wet, dank smell. And then Thai, you're going to be looking at more equatorial kind of...
[01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:52.070]  I mean, it can go either way. You can have your chocolates or you can have kind of your fruity,
[01:30:53.430 --> 01:31:00.310]  lemony, citrusy, lemongrass smells. But primarily, those are the two I get off Thai.
[01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:04.070]  I would say either the darker scents or the lighter scents.
[01:31:05.670 --> 01:31:09.590]  And Afghans completely dependent on region, honestly. I mean, that's really it.
[01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:14.630]  I could go a little bit more into that, but I don't think we have time.
[01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:17.990]  I'm just going to say Ghani turps. That's why I say it.
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:31.440]  Oh, now everybody's looking for the onesie.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.120]  Yeah, they're saying Target. We are doing the layaway program.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:46.480]  I think he's talking about you, so let's throw that back up. Boom.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.280]  You want to give them a follow?
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:59.120]  That's it right there. Feel free to ask questions if you have anything that I wasn't able to answer
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:03.760]  Phil during this time. Feel free to shoot me a DM and I'll get to it as soon as I can.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:09.200]  What was the last growers? That was, did we, it was Grummy.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.360]  Grum, Grum, Grum, Grummy.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:20.570]  Grum, Grum, yeah, that's right. Ba-boom.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:28.600]  And he's got some cool track shots as well. He does some closeups and tries to
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:33.960]  show examples of the heads and the time. He's very scientific. He's really trying to chart
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:39.800]  everything. And that's why I agreed to let him test stuff for me. So I tend to throw stuff out
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:44.840]  his way. Just, he's always like, well, what's cool. I'll send you five packs. Just pop them
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:51.160]  all and find them whatever you like the best. Maine is in the house. Chadwick wishing you
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:53.080]  good health.
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:59.000]  Maine, I was supposed to head out there this weekend, but unfortunately I'm not going to
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:04.120]  be going to the Northeast Cans. So staying home with the fam.
[01:33:11.130 --> 01:33:16.330]  Oh, Mudhoney, man, y'all gonna make me speak on the Mudhoney. It's funny because that's one of
[01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:19.930]  the ones I was going to send over to you guys. That was one of the ones I was kind of thinking
[01:33:19.930 --> 01:33:28.650]  about that. It's just kind of special to me as well. That is something that I created many years
[01:33:28.650 --> 01:33:35.050]  ago. I think I created that in 2014 before I actually had this company and I just kind of got
[01:33:35.050 --> 01:33:47.450]  around to it about 2016. And so it's a Cobain Kush crossed with 501st OG and I'm sorry, medicated OG
[01:33:47.450 --> 01:33:52.250]  back cross cross with Cobain Kush. That was the green river OG I was just thinking of, but
[01:33:52.810 --> 01:33:58.890]  medicated OG back cross was a one to one. And so the medicated OG was originally from
[01:33:59.770 --> 01:34:05.530]  red eye genetics and it was like the most OG smelling one to one that I've found. But
[01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:12.890]  unfortunately I only had a cut of it. And so I believe I found parents in, it was a double barrel
[01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:23.290]  and used that for a back cross on it. Was able to find a male that had CBD dominance in him as well.
[01:34:24.490 --> 01:34:28.330]  It ended up moving to recessive on the next generation, but that's another story. So,
[01:34:29.290 --> 01:34:35.370]  so I ended up putting that onto him and then moving to a Cobain Kush male that was a chocolate
[01:34:35.370 --> 01:34:42.250]  bubble leaner. I wanted something that was bubble influenced just for pain, but it also was a real
[01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:49.290]  quick flowering time. And so those two together, I was expecting a one to one in all honesty.
[01:34:49.290 --> 01:34:55.930]  That was my outcome. And then what I had was a THC dominant cultivar that was full spectrum. And so
[01:34:56.650 --> 01:35:04.010]  it's been tested in all kinds of ranges, but it's primarily THC dominant. It has high levels of CBD,
[01:35:04.570 --> 01:35:13.290]  high levels of CBG. It has THCV, it has Delta eight CBC, CBN. There was actually
[01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:20.570]  some terpenes in there that I've never seen before that they, they said on their analysis,
[01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:24.570]  there were certain things that the guy had was intrigued. He called me a person, the lab
[01:35:24.570 --> 01:35:28.410]  technician and let me know about it because it was such an interesting profile. And so
[01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:33.530]  I've been hunting that actually the past few years and trying to find something
[01:35:34.170 --> 01:35:40.250]  with a full profile in both aspects of it. And so I finally found a female worth using. I'm just
[01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:45.050]  hunting for the male right now on the F2s, but I do have some of that stock available as well.
[01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:54.880]  And I might shoot those over to them once we're done with this today. First C-Packs I ever got,
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:03.200]  they didn't come in packs. They came from all the best weed that you could find. Usually you'd find
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:09.680]  a seed or two and you put it in a film canister jars or like traveling overseas, like going to
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:14.720]  Canada and stuff. Sometimes they had like these smaller shops that we would get these weird
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:20.640]  little packets back in the late nineties when like, I think it was Mark Emery was running those.
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:26.240]  And so they, I mean, some of them were labeled or they'd have it, but I mean, a lot of time it
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:30.560]  wasn't until like late nineties, two thousands that we started. I personally started ordering
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:36.000]  from the Dutch banks and stuff like that. And then I kind of started understanding, you know,
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.360]  more of my lineages and things like that. But back when I first started, I mean,
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.040]  I was growing bag seed for days.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:54.300]  So we have a, whoop, that wasn't the one I was, I meant to throw up that one and then
[01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:54.940]  come with the...
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:37:04.220]  I'm, dude, I immediately got, I was like falling around. So the one person that could do it,
[01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:09.180]  they aren't making jerseys because they're supplying medical supplies for the pandemic
[01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:17.020]  currently. And so I had another friend reach out and say that he has a friend who does certain
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:21.580]  things like this. And so I'm going to reach out to him and do it. But I mean, this is, I'm
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:23.580]  definitely getting that set up.
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:23.980]  Robert Leonard
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:30.140]  Let's do that together. I actually made this a long time ago. It was kind of the idea of like,
[01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:36.220]  you know, cities that lost their sports teams and if they came back, would you rename them? And I
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:41.980]  was like, well, the wheat industry has lots of money. They should give a nod. It's like when
[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:49.980]  they name teams, they give a nod. Like, you know, like they were a fishing town or like the Three
[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:58.060]  Rivers Stadium or whatever. And I was like, well, how about Chronic? But I actually, I want to reach
[01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:03.500]  out to Sean Kemp and see if he'll come on, which would be kind of cool.
[01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:06.540]  Well, he has a shop now, so I don't see why he wouldn't.
[01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:14.940]  I know. And I have, I have, until we have the Sean Kemp Chronic jerseys, we have the,
[01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:22.220]  this is actually the Robert Parrish special. So if you can see the double zero on the back of the
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:37.730]  sheaf. So do we have, yeah, this guy, Kemp opening this store. Yeah. So has he opened it or
[01:38:37.730 --> 01:38:44.450]  he's about to open it? I think he's opening it. Yeah, I'm not sure. I know it's in Seattle and
[01:38:44.450 --> 01:38:53.570]  that's all I know. Got it. So I think, did we cover pretty much everything except for the clone?
[01:38:54.610 --> 01:38:59.890]  Yep. I think so. So do you want to, do we want to do something with the clone? Like,
[01:38:59.890 --> 01:39:06.370]  is that something we can put out there? Absolutely. I got one, maybe two, but
[01:39:06.370 --> 01:39:12.610]  it's going to go to the same person. So we'll put that up shortly, but what he's talking about,
[01:39:14.690 --> 01:39:22.130]  is the Melvin clone. Actually I can, yeah, so I can put the images up. So why don't you talk about
[01:39:22.130 --> 01:39:29.330]  it and then I'll. All right. So Melvin's, this is something, another project that I've kind of been
[01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:36.610]  working on and I was hoping to release, but unfortunately it was another project that I
[01:39:36.610 --> 01:39:41.490]  just didn't get enough seeds to do a proper, I mean, to release and do a proper hunt. And so
[01:39:41.490 --> 01:39:47.970]  unfortunately for people, my priority is hunting. So I can possibly produce more seeds for it.
[01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:57.410]  That being said, I was using Kevin Jodry's Wonderland cut of the Z, which I had got,
[01:39:58.290 --> 01:40:04.610]  I think probably about a year and a half, two years ago. Ended up running that and then wanting
[01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:09.890]  to find something just that would clone a little bit better because the main thing that everyone
[01:40:09.890 --> 01:40:15.570]  told me, especially with Z is that it clones for shit. Like it's like 20% or 10% rate or it's,
[01:40:15.570 --> 01:40:22.130]  you know, it grows like shit. It's slow. It's this. And so, I mean, it has what most consumers
[01:40:22.130 --> 01:40:27.330]  want in terms of bag appeal, terps, things of that nature. And I just kind of wanted to beef it up.
[01:40:28.610 --> 01:40:34.210]  And so the onesie was kind of the perfect thing that I thought, and that was the male that I spoke
[01:40:34.210 --> 01:40:42.370]  on earlier. So it was the male that was extremely resistant to all past mildew. He was just a
[01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:49.090]  beautiful, studly male that could regenerate immediately. And so I used him just because he
[01:40:49.090 --> 01:40:57.010]  tended to have a Z dominant terp on the stem rub. And then throwing that on the Wonderland cut,
[01:40:57.010 --> 01:41:02.130]  I came up with Melvin's and then I ended up hunting all these seeds and I ended up finding
[01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:08.690]  this one particular cut. I didn't find any males on it. And so I just, I fell in love with this
[01:41:08.690 --> 01:41:16.290]  dude and he washes ridiculous. I mean, he swells, he's got beautiful flowers. He produces a lot more
[01:41:16.290 --> 01:41:22.690]  than the onesie did in the F1. Like, I mean, he took on everything, basically the onesie was,
[01:41:22.690 --> 01:41:28.450]  and then he beefed it up along with the Z and it just, I mean, it bumped the Z terps up a whole
[01:41:28.450 --> 01:41:34.850]  another level. Like it's like raunchy, gassy Z terp. So I mean, it's a huge improvement. It
[01:41:34.850 --> 01:41:40.050]  clones. It's the first thing to clone in my cloner. Every time, like within six, seven days,
[01:41:40.050 --> 01:41:45.890]  I can usually have roots on them. Super fast to clone, super easy to grow. I mean, it responds
[01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:53.570]  well to any style of topping, branch breaking. You can treat it like shit and it will just grow
[01:41:53.650 --> 01:41:59.010]  amazing flowers for you. But I mean, if you are meticulous to it and you treat it well,
[01:41:59.010 --> 01:42:06.450]  it will treat you extremely well. It looks frosty. It is indeed and terpy.
[01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:26.560]  Okay. So we had, let me go, let me hide that. So we had some questions.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:32.960]  Thoughts on creeper strains. Yeah, that's what I feel like. It's just a delayed reaction due to
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:40.560]  extra THC V or other cannabinoids. Generally it's why I say that is because it tends to be
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:47.200]  more prevalent on some of the older cultivars that were bred in favor for THC. So as we kind
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:53.120]  of know through the history of cannabis, that's what was done. A lot of it was just to do for
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:59.760]  potency, but it was also to reduce the smell just because of the illegal days, they kind of wanted
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:06.000]  to breed out that skunky smell just because it was so loud. And so in favor of potency and then
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:12.080]  reducing the smell. And so I tend to go back and look for older strains and cultivars that have
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:18.000]  that similar effect. And I found that a lot of the older stuff does. I mean, it doesn't necessarily
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:22.240]  hit you immediately. Like the newer stuff will hit you and then you're high for 45 minutes to
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.320]  where the older stuff, it takes 15 minutes for the onset or 10 minutes, and then it lasts an
[01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:31.120]  hour and a half. So I feel like it's a huge delayed effect just to cannabinoids and the
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:39.600]  structure of the terpene profile as well. Indica dominant. I mean, pretty much most of them are
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:47.200]  Boomer that I would say. Death Punch is kind of an even hybrid. Garlic Punch, I would say is
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:53.360]  Indica dominant, but I would say Boomer is probably your best bet. If you want a solid Indica, that
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:44:06.690]  will slow you down. Me too, man. That's why I'm trying to breed it back into some of this stuff.
[01:44:06.690 --> 01:44:13.570]  So I've been working. I actually I'll have a line of stuff with a big Sir Holy IBL. I found a really
[01:44:13.730 --> 01:44:19.810]  nice male that was pink, purple stems, kind of similar to CAGU selection. Just what I could go
[01:44:19.810 --> 01:44:26.370]  off seeing what he did visually off old pictures. And so I kind of looked for something similar
[01:44:26.370 --> 01:44:33.170]  in structure, but it had a little more pink coloration on the anthocyanin. Super recessive
[01:44:33.170 --> 01:44:40.450]  and sacking so that it would display more of the female's nature. I mean, the big Sir, the
[01:44:40.530 --> 01:44:45.730]  turned out really well. And I'm actually doing another IBL right now, but I hit a few females as
[01:44:45.730 --> 01:44:51.170]  well. So the Zoo Kids, that's one of them. And that's the Black Congolese Cross of the 88G13
[01:44:51.170 --> 01:44:56.210]  hash plant. And then I hit that with the big Sir as well. And I have a few others, but we'll get
[01:44:56.210 --> 01:44:59.330]  to those in the future. I have some new stuff coming up with the big Sir.
[01:45:00.930 --> 01:45:08.730]  Yeah. So what's, sorry, I'm just posting kind of the stuff people are talking about in the chat.
[01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:11.850]  What's kind of coming down the pipe?
[01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:17.120]  So coming down the pipe.
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:20.880]  What are you excited about? That you'll have more than like two packs of?
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:23.440]  I would say...
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:25.680]  I feel like we're teasing people today.
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:32.800]  The big Sir line. Definitely a lot of the big Sir stuff. So I have a lot of older stuff. I mean,
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:42.240]  it's a long story, but basically a friend who had a clone from the 80s and basically got what was
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:48.960]  supposedly the last remaining seed stock from that lab. And he's probably the most reliable
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:54.160]  source I would ever trust in that story in terms of he's an old Marine Navy SEAL. I mean,
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:00.560]  he's a Marine Navy SEAL. And he's a guy who's been around for a long time. And he's a guy who
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:05.760]  is a Marine Navy SEAL. I mean, and he's been around all his genetics have been authentic in
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:11.600]  the past. And so I got the rest of his collection for it and I've been hunting those. And so
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:18.400]  the purple U-Dub is definitely up there for me. It's something that I have been hunting forever.
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:24.560]  I'm making a line with those and probably S1s and then the Dugs Varin S1s for THCV,
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:28.320]  some more THCV stuff as well. So.
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:35.720]  I have a lot of stuff coming out, but the next things will be the Big Sur Holdy weed line.
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:49.960]  Okay. So Josh, any, as we come down the home stretch, I got to go take Gemma up imminently.
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:56.440]  I was just going to make the announcement. I was actually trying to get my live stream set up.
[01:46:57.320 --> 01:47:05.880]  Dark Horse is going live pretty soon here. I think right after the show or is it at six o'clock?
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:14.120]  It's at six o'clock. 5.30. They're going to have a little battle on who's splitting up a box set
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:21.240]  they bought from Sin City last week. And then they're going to do the last showdown, I think,
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:27.720]  of the auction. And I think we've met our goals. And I actually think I have some lawyers lined up
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:32.440]  that will do take this all the way through for the money we have raised. So.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:36.440]  Nice. Yeah. And let's talk lawyers.
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:37.400]  I'm pretty good about all that.
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:43.960]  Let's talk lawyer. I mean, offline, but because I talked to Omar Figueroa and he gave me kind of a
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:49.560]  lit... We were trading emails back and forth of like, do you know this lawyer? And he was like,
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:55.720]  that dude's awesome or never heard of that guy or. Cool.
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:58.760]  Any OG crosses coming?
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:05.000]  I'll have some OG stuff. Yeah. So there's one that was called OG Magnum that I did. It was an
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:11.960]  Ultra Mag OG, which is abusive dominant and abusive is one of my personal favorite cuts. It hasn't...
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:16.040]  It's not a more common cut, but it's just something that's super foul. And so I'll be
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:22.200]  working with that here. I'll have those probably out 2021 with some more OG stuff. But I released
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:29.880]  some limited OG lines like the Kemp Kush. That was a limited... I think I released maybe 10,
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:33.400]  15 packs of that total. And that was just auctions only.
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:45.680]  All right. Let me... Do we have home stretch questions?
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:58.840]  I can hear the discord. I can hear the discord popping in my headphones.
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:05.240]  Uh, I like Dark. Jason's a good guy.
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:14.440]  I will be on there as well. So everybody, please tune on to that as well. Go on and help support
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:19.960]  so we can get through this and get Leo the help he needs. But I mean, we pretty much will be able
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:24.920]  to do it. I feel tonight as well. I think he's going to do his podcast and then immediately
[01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:30.520]  after we're going to hop on and start doing the live auctions. And yeah, just try and help Leo
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:36.760]  out the rest of the way. But I was going to let out one cut of Melvin's here as well. So if
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:41.080]  somebody wanted to bid on that, I was going to do a cut of Melvin's.
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:45.080]  You want to do it as like a fundraising auction thing?
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:46.440]  Yeah, just...
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:50:01.360]  Sure. So why not? All right. So this is for... Let me... With my Leo... And this is for Leo
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:17.210]  we're doing. So a Melvin clone shipped from Seattle to you to help Leo.
[01:50:18.890 --> 01:50:22.730]  What do we... Josh, why don't you set the starting bid?
[01:50:23.290 --> 01:50:23.850]  Oh, man.
[01:50:28.170 --> 01:50:30.970]  Hundreds as an understatement. Hundreds.
[01:50:30.970 --> 01:50:37.050]  Hundreds. So I'm going to go. So we're going to get 125. So we're moving.
[01:50:38.250 --> 01:50:43.050]  All right. So we've got spot check news. Dave is already at 125.
[01:50:45.530 --> 01:50:50.090]  Again, this will probably be the only time you guys are going to get it. So whoever secures this,
[01:50:50.090 --> 01:50:51.290]  you're going to be pretty stoked.
[01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:55.290]  Lewis.
[01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:59.350]  I have a feeling Dave's going to take this one.
[01:50:59.430 --> 01:51:04.630]  I can try to ship it to Australia, but it generally does not work out in that favor
[01:51:05.190 --> 01:51:07.670]  with the time. So I would say no, unfortunately.
[01:51:08.710 --> 01:51:14.470]  So, yeah. So do you want to keep it within US and Canada?
[01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:16.630]  Yeah, I would say, unfortunately, US and Canada.
[01:51:16.630 --> 01:51:20.470]  All right. So everybody bidding, if you're in the US and Canada,
[01:51:22.630 --> 01:51:25.750]  Dave is not going to be denied.
[01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:29.270]  Nope. Already have spot checks at 250.
[01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:32.630]  Now, Shredder, you can't do 226.
[01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:37.030]  Ooh, come crushing with the $1 bid.
[01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:40.710]  This was Shredder.
[01:51:42.230 --> 01:51:43.430]  No dollars and no cents.
[01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:51.910]  That's like prices, right? When the last person bid or they were like, the price is $380.
[01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:54.150]  And the next person is like, I'll go $381.
[01:51:55.910 --> 01:52:00.550]  So Melvin's is going to be Z Skittles, the Wonderland cross.
[01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:04.230]  All right. Sorry. The Wonderland cut cross with 1ZF2.
[01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:10.520]  And I just got like a barrage of...
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:13.400]  Landworks coming in with 500.
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:14.760]  He knows what's up.
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:16.840]  Holy shit.
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:18.840]  I'm going to secure this one.
[01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:20.760]  Whoops. Whoops.
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:26.280]  It's like I try to hit on a chat thing and then they scroll by and I hit the wrong one.
[01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:33.480]  Yeah. And if you've had the real Skittles, it's fucking phenomenal.
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:37.880]  You nailed it. It's a bitch to grow.
[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:42.280]  And I went down the same route, the same rabbit hole.
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:45.960]  And that's how I got into the Testarossa Black Vine Reserves and the Testarossa Vine.
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:46.520]  Oh, yeah.
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:47.000]  Yeah.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:47.560]  Yeah.
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:48.120]  I went after that.
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:51.000]  Yep. A little bit of new stuff.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.440]  I know I love Testarossa.
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:55.240]  That's actually something I'm growing out right now that I was...
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:57.960]  I love Testarossa.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:01.480]  I've been trying to hunt the old packs to try and find something else myself from it.
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.040]  Landworks is going to secure this one.
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:17.440]  Will I accept livestock? Unfortunately, no.
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:20.720]  I might though.
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:22.560]  So we can talk about that at any time.
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:23.520]  Send me the DM.
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:27.840]  I got enough.
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:35.280]  My homies got a bunch of chickens and ducks and turkeys and pigs and you name it.
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:36.720]  We can get the birds to you, man.
[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:47.720]  All right. We're still at 500.
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:51.160]  Yep. I'm thinking he's going to take it. Nobody's objecting.
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:57.560]  And actually, I remembered that I had sets in the auctions to make life easier,
[01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:04.120]  which is a Google form for people to fill out with their contact info.
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:08.600]  I have an ask for my one.
[01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:13.800]  Yep. I actually worked with a few of those to make a one-to-one.
[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:20.120]  So I have a string called hula hoops that is a one-to-one, but it's super gassy
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:25.720]  just because I was kind of looking for a fruity gassy one-to-one and it's Honolulu Hayes,
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:28.680]  which is a 20-to-one that I took to an F2.
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:33.720]  And then I used Testa Rosa, Cherry Noir, and Formula One.
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:40.200]  First two went into the third and then I used that as a mail.
[01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:44.620]  Yeah.
[01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:47.020]  Holy shit. And I found it.
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:53.180]  Okay. So I created a form with such critical things as
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:56.860]  what is your YouTube screen name and what is your email address?
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:02.420]  What was the item you won and what did you win it for?
[01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:04.740]  That's perfect.
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:07.620]  If I had that information, like-
[01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:08.660]  What is your address?
[01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:11.300]  ... someone winning something every time, like-
[01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:12.420]  No, what did you win?
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:16.740]  ... Jason Farrington, you can't go backwards.
[01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:20.820]  500. Linework's going to take it.
[01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:22.580]  Yeah. We're already at 500.
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:27.220]  Yeah, Bootsy. I'm fucking high as shit. I've been eating RSO. I threw my
[01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:29.940]  back out. I've been eating RSO and dabbing.
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:30.980]  Oh, man.
[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:39.780]  Yeah. I'm having a hard time sitting. I'm moving my fucking citrus trees into my
[01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:44.500]  greenhouse for the winter. And I kind of just threw them in at the end of the night. And
[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:47.300]  early in the morning, I woke up and I was like, I got to get these down at the end of
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:52.500]  the road. First thing, I just picked up these big, wet 20-gallon pots with huge 12-foot
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:53.460]  tall trees and just-
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:54.580]  Yep. Yep.
[01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:58.740]  Just like, yeah, dude, you're going to be 40 this year.
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:04.100]  All right. So we got the final minute because I got to go. It's Gemma's-
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:04.580]  Yep.
[01:56:04.580 --> 01:56:05.780]  We're doing her birthday dinner tonight-
[01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:06.500]  I think Linework did it.
[01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:07.700]  ... so I got to go pick her up.
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:11.540]  Linework did the-
[01:56:11.540 --> 01:56:12.580]  Should we call it a winner?
[01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:13.140]  ... big bid.
[01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:15.620]  Yeah. I say we call it Linework.
[01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:21.540]  All right. So Linework's, while everyone's paying attention, I'm going to go pick up
[01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:28.580]  Linework's, while everyone's paying attention, if you can slide on over to that
[01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:38.100]  Google spreadsheet and fill it out and get back to me, we can get that cut
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:45.300]  covertly, secretly, and delicately sent to your house.
[01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:57.470]  And I'd like to thank the Superchronic for hanging out with us today.
[01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:59.870]  Well, thank you. I appreciate you having me on, homie.
[01:57:04.130 --> 01:57:10.130]  We should do a seed popping talk one of these days and bring maybe a bunch of people in and
[01:57:10.850 --> 01:57:17.730]  hear how they do it. People are always asking and people are always fucking it up.
[01:57:18.690 --> 01:57:18.930]  Yeah.
[01:57:19.730 --> 01:57:25.010]  I do it real simple in soil trays with the dome, heat mat, and I come up and I-
[01:57:25.810 --> 01:57:28.770]  Yeah, Cody, we know you didn't bid.
[01:57:30.530 --> 01:57:32.210]  Yeah, we got you. Linework's got this.
[01:57:32.850 --> 01:57:36.130]  Yeah. Linework's the winner, if I can find you.
[01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:40.850]  I have his information too. I've dealt with him before in the past.
[01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:45.170]  Oh, cool, cool, cool. All right. Holy shit, that makes my life easier.
[01:57:45.170 --> 01:57:50.130]  That might just like my stress level is just one way down.
[01:57:50.690 --> 01:57:51.970]  Yeah, he's cool. Yeah, he's cool.
[01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:59.650]  How would you pop 20-year-olds of all seeds? I would try two of them. And if they don't pop,
[01:57:59.650 --> 01:58:03.650]  I would hold on to the rest until I can afford to get them done in a lab.
[01:58:04.690 --> 01:58:07.410]  Yep, yep. Somebody who can in vitro.
[01:58:09.490 --> 01:58:13.090]  If you don't have a... Sometimes I'll try a seed cracker or a gilliberic acid,
[01:58:13.090 --> 01:58:18.050]  something like that on a few. But like you said, maybe try one as a test, two more,
[01:58:18.050 --> 01:58:23.250]  maybe another on a seed cracker just to see if the embryo is still alive and if there's
[01:58:23.250 --> 01:58:27.170]  any coloration to it. And then if they all look kind of dead, then most likely you're
[01:58:27.170 --> 01:58:30.610]  going to want a tissue culture specialist or somebody to try and revive them.
[01:58:31.810 --> 01:58:41.680]  Yeah. And on special packs, I might take a look here. They're just putting them in soil,
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:47.120]  you know, maybe. I mean, like with something like that, I'd probably put them in water,
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:52.240]  but I'm the sort of person that I'm going to be looking at them every two hours, like no
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:56.560]  matter what. I might go to sleep and look at them and then sleep for six hours and get up
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:00.240]  because I know those beings and I'm not sleeping well worried about them, you know?
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:07.760]  So I just think that a lot of people get into a lot of over water, you know,
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:15.360]  bacteria shit in the bags and all that stuff, you know, because they're not as, you know,
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.480]  life is life and it's going on for people and they're not always able to pay as much attention.
[01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:24.160]  As much attention? Do you know how to speak?
[01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:25.780]  Whoops.
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:30.160]  Not so much right now. I'm kind of there with you. Everything's kicking my feet as well.
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:36.160]  All right. So why don't we...
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:36.880]  That's where I'm headed.
[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:40.560]  Tissue culture?
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:45.840]  Yep. Yeah. That's kind of where I've been dabbling in things is trying to get into the tissue
[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:49.840]  culture side of things and starting a nursery. So.
[01:59:52.940 --> 01:59:57.100]  All right. So let me... Give me one second.
[01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:00.940]  I'd like to learn more about that because it's just getting to the point where it's like,
[02:00:00.940 --> 02:00:05.900]  fuck, it's too much, you know? And you're holding hundreds of plants just and you're like,
[02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:09.180]  want to do proper work at home, multiple generations. It's just like...
[02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:12.860]  I know the storage on them. It's so crazy to be able to just have
[02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:17.900]  a little container that has all your plants and then to be able to revive it. Oh,
[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:22.060]  let me just grab that calc and go off to work. So I find it fascinating, man.
[02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:28.680]  He says, I look like I need some sleep. Yeah, I fucking need some sleep.
[02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:32.920]  It's October, dude. I've worked like 18 hour days since April.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.920]  Next month. Next month is sleep month.
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:44.040]  Yeah. It's almost like when the daylight sits and everything, the time just slows down and
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:49.080]  in a couple of weeks, once everything's wrapped up, I will just start sleeping in more.
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:50.360]  Yeah.
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:55.960]  For like an hour or two, it's really hard. Yeah. And then Christmas happens and you're,
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:58.440]  fuck, spring's coming, time to plant seeds.
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:02.040]  Yep. Starts all over again, the cycle of life.
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:03.000]  Yeah.
[02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:10.200]  So just quickly, I'm just looking at some of the people who recently picked up some packs. Thank
[02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:15.880]  you, Chris. Thank you, Don. Thank you, Matt. Thank you, Casey. Thank you, Nick. Thank you,
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:22.600]  Robert. Thank you, Dallas. Thank you, James. Thank you, John. Thank you, Don. Thank you,
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:33.080]  Michael. Thank you, Richard. So anyway, with that, we can call it and that's-
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:41.640]  We are lining a bunch of these up, you guys. On Sunday, we have Pacific Northwest Roots
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:48.680]  coming on. That'll be really fun. And I'm talking with just a bunch of cool people that I haven't
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:55.000]  talked to in the past. So this is really fun to me and it's exciting. I think it's a
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:02.840]  real cool platform to buy seeds in this venue and we all really appreciate the conversation and the
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:10.200]  learning. Support good people, small breeders doing interesting stuff, finding, teasing out
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:18.040]  unique genetics and terpenes and cannabinoids. And they all have different things they're focused on
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:24.040]  with their intent. So- It's fun just getting to geek out with you guys, man. I appreciate it.
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:28.200]  Yeah, dude. Big ups to the work you're doing, man. It's cool stuff and
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:33.480]  fucking stoked to hang out sometime, man, when this COVID shit goes away.
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:38.360]  I know. Hopefully, sooner than later, right? That's what we can all say.
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:43.400]  All right. So what time do we want to do on Sunday?
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:49.260]  I think we're going to do in the morning. It'll be like 10 or 11. We haven't nailed it down.
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:57.800]  We'll do a post though. Which is the morning after Halloween.
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:01.000]  So don't eat too much candy so you can wake up.
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:03.800]  You can go right there.
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:12.440]  Yep. My son is so stoked. He's never had a lollipop before in January and he's going to
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:19.080]  have a lollipop for Halloween. He's just like, holy shit.
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:26.760]  My two-year-old had a shot today. So she got a lollipop at 10 in the morning. She was just
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:28.680]  demolishing it.
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:32.200]  Sugar for the day.
[02:03:36.030 --> 02:03:43.950]  All right. So we'll end with James's comment. How about that? All right. Everybody, have a good
[02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:54.110]  night. We appreciate it. There's going to be a fundraiser kicking off in what? 50 minutes, right?
[02:03:55.230 --> 02:03:55.550]  Six?
[02:03:56.350 --> 02:03:57.310]  Yeah, somewhere around there.
[02:03:57.310 --> 02:04:04.830]  So seven. Yeah, because they're in Colorado. So seven o'clock Pacific time, six o'clock.
[02:04:06.910 --> 02:04:08.270]  I think they're already live now.
[02:04:09.230 --> 02:04:16.030]  Fuck. All right. Then let's end this and go support a good cause in this case.
[02:04:16.030 --> 02:04:17.470]  Let's do it. We'll see you over there.
[02:04:19.150 --> 02:04:19.470]  All right.
[02:04:19.470 --> 02:04:21.230]  All right. Thank you, everybody. Appreciate you.
[02:04:22.110 --> 02:04:24.190]  With that, I will kill the live stream.
[02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:26.990]  Peace.
