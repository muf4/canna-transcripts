[00:00.000 --> 00:15.990]  Dr. Wong, I wanted to say it was a pleasure hearing your talk today.
[00:15.990 --> 00:17.990]  It was very informative.
[00:17.990 --> 00:22.990]  I'm Paul Santos, and I work for a private diagnostic lab called Waypoint Analytical,
[00:22.990 --> 00:25.990]  and we're located in Anaheim, California.
[00:25.990 --> 00:29.990]  It was very interesting to hear you list a lot of the diseases that you were talking about
[00:29.990 --> 00:32.990]  because we've been offering this service for quite some time, too,
[00:32.990 --> 00:35.990]  ever since cannabis became legal in California,
[00:35.990 --> 00:40.990]  and we were seeing many of the diseases that you were speaking about in your presentation.
[00:40.990 --> 00:44.990]  So it was kind of nice to kind of get that confirmation that both of us as pathologists
[00:44.990 --> 00:48.990]  were seeing the same issues that are facing many of the growers of this crop.
[00:48.990 --> 00:54.990]  So some of the issues that we see most often were repeated in your presentation,
[00:54.990 --> 01:02.990]  things like fusarium causing both crown rot, root rot, stem rot, pythium root rot.
[01:02.990 --> 01:08.990]  We're not dealing so much with the hemp production side of the industry.
[01:08.990 --> 01:13.990]  Most of ours is medicinal or recreational, so we don't get to see a lot of the field-grown things
[01:13.990 --> 01:17.990]  that you were mentioning, you know, the seed-related issues.
[01:17.990 --> 01:23.990]  Most of the clients that we service, they're obtaining their plant material from propagation houses,
[01:23.990 --> 01:27.990]  or they're doing their own clonal cuttings and rooting their own material.
[01:27.990 --> 01:31.990]  So we do see a lot of that fusarium that you were talking about that can get transmitted,
[01:31.990 --> 01:33.990]  you know, from infected motherstocks.
[01:33.990 --> 01:36.990]  So I thought that was a very important issue that you brought up.
[01:36.990 --> 01:38.990]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:38.990 --> 01:44.990]  So I work for the State of Nevada Department of Agriculture.
[01:44.990 --> 01:51.990]  So as a plant pathologist, I deal with everything, not just industrial hemp and also my water plants.
[01:51.990 --> 01:59.990]  So for some reason, during the last two years, there's a lot of problems associated with industrial hemp
[01:59.990 --> 02:02.990]  and the cannabis production in Nevada.
[02:02.990 --> 02:06.990]  So we have a chance to look at those issues.
[02:06.990 --> 02:12.990]  We take a lot of samples, we accept samples, so we do analysis, we do the diagnostics,
[02:12.990 --> 02:17.990]  and also we do the DNA barcoding to identify what kind of pathogen is in there
[02:17.990 --> 02:20.990]  so we can figure out what's wrong with all those issues.
[02:20.990 --> 02:28.990]  So we do find a lot of diseases, which is why I'm excited to present in the conference.
[02:28.990 --> 02:36.990]  Yeah, I agree totally with you because I think, you know, one of the benefits of legalization of marijuana
[02:36.990 --> 02:44.990]  or the greater extent of growing hemp as an industrial crop is that now we're being able to open that industry up
[02:44.990 --> 02:52.990]  to the much needed science because there's a big gap in the knowledge that we have with respect to the diseases
[02:52.990 --> 02:56.990]  that impact both marijuana and the hemp crops.
[02:56.990 --> 03:01.990]  So it's kind of exciting. We kind of feel like maybe we're on the cutting edge, right, at the frontier,
[03:01.990 --> 03:07.990]  trying to find new things and discovering new things that impact this crop and the growers that try to cultivate it.
[03:08.990 --> 03:15.990]  I feel the same way because every time we look at the cannabis or either industrial hemp or medical marijuana plants,
[03:15.990 --> 03:18.990]  there's nobody that has done very much work on that.
[03:18.990 --> 03:25.990]  So anything funny from that type of crop, it could be new disease or some kind of new conditions.
[03:25.990 --> 03:32.990]  So the growers need the information to resolve the problem, but unfortunately not very many people really work on that.
[03:32.990 --> 03:40.990]  A lot of people I contact say they have research facility, they have technical advantage, but they just don't want to work on that.
[03:40.990 --> 03:48.990]  For example, I talk about virus. There's something infected by some kind of virus, but we cannot figure out what it is.
[03:48.990 --> 03:53.990]  So they need some kind of research to figure out. So hopefully in the future, people can work on more.
[03:53.990 --> 03:58.990]  Yeah, I know. It makes me wish that maybe I was more of a virologist and not so much of a mycologist.
[03:59.990 --> 04:06.990]  I don't know what your expertise was or what you specialized in when you were in graduate school, but I do see a lot of clients ask questions about viruses.
[04:06.990 --> 04:12.990]  And I honestly have to tell them that aside from hearing maybe hemp mosaic, I don't know much else.
[04:12.990 --> 04:20.990]  Right, yeah. But by training myself as a pneumatologist, also plant pathologist, and also molecular biologist,
[04:21.990 --> 04:24.990]  so actually I got three different expertise in there.
[04:24.990 --> 04:35.990]  In the plant pathologist world, I was more focused on the soil borne fungus, or nematodes, and the virus, also plant viruses.
[04:35.990 --> 04:44.990]  So you mentioned nematodes. I did have one question that I didn't get to ask you during your presentation, and maybe I don't know if I heard right or not.
[04:44.990 --> 04:52.990]  But was it mostly the lesion nematode is the one of primary problem on hemp? Or we're not real sure yet?
[04:52.990 --> 05:04.990]  The reason I point out the lesion nematodes, which is called the praetalankes, is because we found this from the potato field, from some fields.
[05:05.990 --> 05:20.990]  Because I talk about the root rot. The reason why root rot is so devastating is just because could be some kind of nematodes take some role to make the plants more susceptible to fungal infection.
[05:20.990 --> 05:21.990]  That's an excellent point.
[05:21.990 --> 05:26.990]  So that's why I address the nematodes in the disease complex.
[05:26.990 --> 05:29.990]  That would be very interesting. It would be interesting to see what you find out.
[05:29.990 --> 05:31.990]  Yeah, but we still work on that.
[05:32.990 --> 05:38.990]  I think there's one grower from New Mexico. He asked about, did you find verticillium?
[05:38.990 --> 05:53.990]  Verticillium wilt, since we found for cereal wilt, some other diseases, he's got some kind of problem with verticillium, which is a big issue for some crops, like peppermint is a huge problem.
[05:53.990 --> 05:59.990]  But so far I haven't found any from the cannabis yet. So I still pay attention to it.
[05:59.990 --> 06:09.990]  Because every time the sample came in, they got wilting or some kind of disease going on, I always check for verticillium to make sure there's anything in there.
[06:09.990 --> 06:14.990]  Sure, sure. Yeah, I'd have to say in the samples that we've received, we've never seen verticillium either.
[06:14.990 --> 06:17.990]  But it's something that's always on your radar, for sure.
[06:18.990 --> 06:25.990]  That's good too. Don't have any verticillium on the cannabis. Nobody wants it. Nobody wishes they have it.
[06:25.990 --> 06:31.990]  There is one disease, though, that I didn't see mentioned on your survey that you've been conducting.
[06:31.990 --> 06:44.990]  And one that we've been seeing of late, and that's a thalabiopsis, causing a root rot, but also invading the crown at the bottom of the plant too.
[06:44.990 --> 06:46.990]  I don't know if maybe you've come across that or not.
[06:46.990 --> 06:48.990]  No, no, I haven't come across that yet.
[06:48.990 --> 06:56.990]  I would be very curious to know what species it is, because it's difficult and it's much slower growing than thalabiopsis bacillus.
[06:56.990 --> 07:03.990]  So maybe that's something, if we had an isolate, that if we sent it to you, would you be interested in maybe determining what species it is?
[07:03.990 --> 07:07.990]  Well, we probably can do a barcoding to figure out what it is.
[07:07.990 --> 07:12.990]  So if you get a chance, you can send me some image or describe what kind of disease it looks like.
[07:13.990 --> 07:16.990]  And send me some sample, or maybe an isolate.
[07:16.990 --> 07:17.990]  Yeah, a culture plate.
[07:17.990 --> 07:21.990]  Yeah, a culture plate. We can figure out what species it is.
[07:21.990 --> 07:22.990]  Yeah, that'd be cool.
[07:22.990 --> 07:23.990]  Yeah, right.
[07:23.990 --> 07:28.990]  And then I don't have time to write stuff up, and I don't have a facility for doing inoculations for Cox's postulates.
[07:28.990 --> 07:32.990]  Maybe that's something on your end, and you could get a publication out of it.
[07:32.990 --> 07:37.990]  Oh yeah, we can cooperate. So we'll kind of figure out what's wrong with the crop.
[07:38.990 --> 07:48.340]  It's not very much information on the cannabis crop diseases.
[07:48.340 --> 07:52.340]  So there's a lot of growers in the U.S.
[07:52.340 --> 07:57.340]  They're going to grow a lot of hemp and also medical marijuana plants in the facility.
[07:57.340 --> 08:01.340]  They need information on how to manage those diseases.
[08:01.340 --> 08:05.340]  So they don't have those information, and they don't know how to manage it.
[08:05.340 --> 08:06.340]  So that's a big issue.
[08:06.340 --> 08:11.340]  And people can do some work to figure out what's wrong with it.
[08:11.340 --> 08:12.340]  That's great.
[08:12.340 --> 08:17.340]  That can help them to produce healthy cannabis crops.
[08:18.340 --> 08:20.340]  Well, I would ask you one question.
[08:20.340 --> 08:26.340]  Because both you and I, we kind of agree that we do cannabis, but it's kind of on the side.
[08:26.340 --> 08:28.340]  Yeah, it's on the side. It's true.
[08:28.340 --> 08:31.340]  There are a lot of other plants and crops that we both deal with.
[08:31.340 --> 08:32.340]  Right.
[08:32.340 --> 08:39.340]  But what do you think is maybe one of the most challenging things that faces the cannabis industry
[08:39.340 --> 08:43.340]  when we start talking about management of diseases?
[08:43.340 --> 08:47.340]  What do you think would be the most challenging thing to growers?
[08:47.340 --> 08:53.340]  I think the most challenge is how the grower can get healthy plants.
[08:53.340 --> 08:57.340]  Because I talked to one of the attendees.
[08:57.340 --> 09:04.340]  She said, is there any program that really can provide healthy stock, healthy plants?
[09:05.340 --> 09:10.340]  They can start from the very beginning that plants, what they have is healthy.
[09:10.340 --> 09:11.340]  So that's a big challenge.
[09:11.340 --> 09:15.340]  So I said, no, nobody really does this kind of thing.
[09:15.340 --> 09:18.340]  So maybe in the future, there's a direction to do that.
[09:24.680 --> 09:33.680]  Tissue culture generates disease-free stock plants or germ plasma, whatever they call that.
[09:33.680 --> 09:42.680]  So you just get a very clean, disease-free, clean stock to start with cannabis growing business.
[09:42.680 --> 09:43.680]  Right.
[09:43.680 --> 09:46.680]  So that's probably the best way. That's called prevention.
[09:46.680 --> 09:54.680]  So and also the challenge is that there's no chemical product like pesticide or fungicide.
[09:54.680 --> 09:59.680]  They're not labeled for cannabis, so they cannot use it for cannabis crop.
[09:59.680 --> 10:04.680]  So they have to use some alternative product and they may not be very effective.
[10:04.680 --> 10:07.680]  Depends on what kind of condition they treat.
[10:07.680 --> 10:10.680]  So that's a lot of challenge for them too.
[10:10.680 --> 10:14.680]  And so they're almost forced to be organic growers by default.
[10:14.680 --> 10:15.680]  Right.
[10:15.680 --> 10:17.680]  Technically it is.
[10:17.680 --> 10:19.680]  So it's not so bad.
[10:19.680 --> 10:23.680]  It's not that it's impossible, but it's much more challenging.
[10:23.680 --> 10:25.680]  Yeah, right. It's a challenge.
[10:29.810 --> 10:34.810]  Well, in order to do virus testing, you need to have specialized equipment.
[10:34.810 --> 10:39.810]  There are some ELISA-based kits that are available on the market.
[10:39.810 --> 10:49.810]  But the biggest problem is that we don't have a firm understanding of what viruses have been described on cannabis in the first place.
[10:49.810 --> 10:50.810]  Right.
[10:50.810 --> 10:51.810]  Would you agree?
[10:51.810 --> 10:52.810]  Yeah, that's true.
[10:52.810 --> 10:58.810]  So even though we can test the virus, but we don't know what kind of virus to test for.
[10:58.810 --> 11:04.810]  So you have to know what species you want to test for that specific virus.
[11:04.810 --> 11:07.810]  So a lot of the time we just don't know what to test for.
[11:07.810 --> 11:09.810]  So that's kind of a big challenge.
[11:09.810 --> 11:11.810]  So there's a way to do that.
[11:11.810 --> 11:13.810]  They call it next generation sequences.
[11:14.810 --> 11:23.810]  So that way you don't need to know the target, but you can detect whatever is inside the plants based on RNA.
[11:23.810 --> 11:28.810]  So you can test this specific virus, even a novel new virus in the plants.
[11:28.810 --> 11:34.810]  So that's technology in there, but it just kind of costs too much money and time to do that.
[11:34.810 --> 11:39.810]  So we don't know what type of virus affects the cannabis crop.
[11:39.810 --> 11:41.810]  And it's still a question mark.
[11:49.710 --> 11:52.710]  I would say that the diseases are regional.
[11:52.710 --> 11:59.710]  I mean, there are some commonalities, but for example, you know, in California, and I would imagine here in Nevada,
[11:59.710 --> 12:02.710]  it's probably the same where it tends to be more arid.
[12:02.710 --> 12:07.710]  You know, we're going to see one subset of diseases are going to be more common to our area.
[12:07.710 --> 12:15.710]  Whereas if you're a grower, say like in Kentucky, maybe there may be foliar diseases that we were never going to see just because we don't have the rainfall that they have.
[12:16.710 --> 12:21.710]  That's right. That's right. Because in a different region, like say in the Midwest or in the back east,
[12:21.710 --> 12:29.710]  they may be good high humidity and they got some other diseases which we don't see very much in the western, like especially in Nevada.
[12:29.710 --> 12:31.710]  It's pretty dry, arid condition.
[12:31.710 --> 12:35.710]  So may not see very often, like say powder mildew.
[12:35.710 --> 12:41.710]  You may see very much in some other part of the United States, but not in Nevada farmland.
[12:41.710 --> 12:46.710]  So that's something that's environment dependent.
[12:52.060 --> 12:57.060]  Well, as I presented this morning, I said prevention is the key.
[12:57.060 --> 13:04.060]  So try to prevent introduction of any type of disease agent into your facility.
[13:04.060 --> 13:08.060]  So that's the best way to prevent disease.
[13:08.060 --> 13:16.060]  And also try to monitor your facility, make sure you keep track on that.
[13:16.060 --> 13:26.060]  Once you see the disease, you have to take action right away as soon as possible before they spread or overwhelming in the facility.
[13:26.060 --> 13:31.060]  So that's my takeaway message for those growers.
[13:31.060 --> 13:33.060]  I think that's an excellent point.
[13:33.060 --> 13:41.060]  That prevention through good sanitation, that has to be the foundation of any program, especially in cannabis,
[13:41.060 --> 13:47.060]  where your options for control once a disease outbreak has occurred are so limited.
[13:47.060 --> 13:50.060]  I agree wholeheartedly with that.
[13:57.550 --> 14:03.550]  Well, me personally, when I think back to my days as a graduate student,
[14:03.550 --> 14:11.550]  I think that the number one risk of growing something that's a monoculture and is genetically uniform,
[14:11.550 --> 14:19.550]  like when you're using clonal stock, the problem is that if you do get a pathogen to this introduction and they're all susceptible,
[14:19.550 --> 14:28.550]  then the risk for spread and for greater loss in yield is significantly higher than if you had a diverse cropping system.
[14:28.550 --> 14:36.550]  Although I'm not sure I would argue that crops that are planted outdoors are any less of a monoculture than those planted indoors,
[14:36.550 --> 14:43.550]  even though there may be other things around that environment where these cannabis crops are being grown outdoors.
[14:43.550 --> 14:47.550]  I mean, they could potentially be sources of pathogen inoculum.
[14:47.550 --> 14:49.550]  We just don't simply know yet.
[14:49.550 --> 14:58.550]  Well, for sure, monocultures really make the disease occur more easily than the multiple species.
[14:58.550 --> 15:07.550]  So the cannabis production indoors is actually really favorable for some type of diseases, for sure.
[15:07.550 --> 15:13.550]  So it's a really big issue for monoculture, especially for disease.
