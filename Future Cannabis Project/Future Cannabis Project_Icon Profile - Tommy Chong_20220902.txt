[00:00.000 --> 00:01.440]  One, two, last four!
[00:01.440 --> 00:04.440]  Can't rest for going to sleep!
[00:04.440 --> 00:07.440]  Can't rest for going to sleep!
[00:22.420 --> 00:25.420]  All right, so we should be recording here.
[00:25.420 --> 00:26.420]  And...
[00:26.420 --> 00:27.420]  Ooh!
[00:27.420 --> 00:28.420]  Yep.
[00:28.420 --> 00:33.420]  All right, welcome everybody to a special episode of the Friendly Cannabis Show.
[00:33.420 --> 00:38.920]  This is part of our Icon Series, and today we have an icon amongst icons.
[00:38.920 --> 00:40.420]  We have Mr. Tommy Chong.
[00:40.860 --> 00:43.360]  Thank you for making time to be with me today.
[00:43.360 --> 00:44.360]  Well, thank you.
[00:44.360 --> 00:48.360]  And being an icon is almost as nice as being a Mexican.
[00:48.360 --> 00:49.360]  How so?
[00:51.360 --> 00:53.360]  Well, you gotta be something, you know?
[00:53.360 --> 00:54.360]  There we go.
[00:54.360 --> 00:55.360]  Okay.
[00:55.360 --> 00:56.360]  Good things to be.
[00:56.360 --> 00:57.360]  Good things to be.
[00:57.360 --> 00:58.360]  Well, yeah.
[00:58.360 --> 01:04.360]  Again, definitely, I know we're gonna talk here for a little bit under an hour.
[01:04.360 --> 01:09.360]  There's a few things I definitely want to touch on regarding cannabis and your role
[01:10.300 --> 01:13.300]  with that, but I want to start off with some light questions.
[01:13.300 --> 01:18.300]  Now, I've been smoking cannabis for decades.
[01:18.300 --> 01:20.300]  I still can't really roll a joint.
[01:20.300 --> 01:22.300]  How's your joint?
[01:22.300 --> 01:23.300]  I need a dollar bill.
[01:23.300 --> 01:25.300]  I need a dollar bill to roll my joint.
[01:25.300 --> 01:26.300]  Well, that's okay.
[01:26.300 --> 01:27.300]  You know, assist.
[01:27.300 --> 01:29.300]  People need canes.
[01:29.300 --> 01:31.300]  People need crutches, you know?
[01:31.300 --> 01:34.300]  You can't knock them for it, you know?
[01:34.300 --> 01:38.300]  My joint rolling, you know, I had to go back to it.
[01:39.240 --> 01:44.240]  I got one complaint is that they got these big ass papers now, you know?
[01:44.240 --> 01:45.240]  Oh, yeah.
[01:45.240 --> 01:47.240]  The big papers.
[01:47.240 --> 01:53.240]  Now, I rolled this joint, and you can see it's, you know, it's okay.
[01:53.240 --> 01:55.240]  It's gonna smoke.
[01:55.240 --> 01:57.240]  Yeah, no, it'll work.
[01:57.240 --> 01:59.240]  You know, get it around here.
[01:59.240 --> 02:07.240]  What I do, though, I smoke out of these little miniature joint.
[02:08.180 --> 02:10.180]  And everything's backwards with these cameras.
[02:10.180 --> 02:11.180]  It's awesome.
[02:11.180 --> 02:12.180]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:12.180 --> 02:15.180]  This is like an NFT joint holder.
[02:15.180 --> 02:23.180]  Now, the idea is to put the joint in the top here, see?
[02:23.180 --> 02:29.180]  And then let me see if I can.
[02:29.180 --> 02:31.180]  Yes.
[02:35.250 --> 02:41.250]  Now, the good thing is that if I want to set it down, everything's backwards.
[02:41.250 --> 02:44.250]  I can set it down like on the table.
[02:44.250 --> 02:45.250]  Nice.
[02:45.250 --> 02:46.250]  It doesn't move.
[02:46.250 --> 02:48.250]  It's gonna stay there.
[02:48.250 --> 02:50.250]  And if I forget about it, it doesn't hurt anything.
[02:50.250 --> 02:54.250]  It'll either go out or, you know, it'll burn.
[02:54.250 --> 02:56.250]  You know, it'll probably go out.
[02:56.250 --> 02:59.250]  Because if you notice, weed is like weed.
[02:59.250 --> 03:00.250]  You know what I mean?
[03:01.190 --> 03:05.190]  If you don't keep puffing on it, the sucker gets lazy and just goes out by itself.
[03:05.190 --> 03:06.190]  Yes.
[03:06.190 --> 03:08.190]  I love this plant, man.
[03:08.190 --> 03:10.190]  It's so magical.
[03:10.190 --> 03:12.190]  Yeah, it's a wonderful plant.
[03:12.190 --> 03:14.190]  I'm about to enjoy some myself.
[03:14.190 --> 03:16.190]  What do you have inside your joint right now?
[03:16.190 --> 03:21.190]  It's, I'm not sure, really.
[03:21.190 --> 03:24.190]  Because I mix up a lot.
[03:24.190 --> 03:28.190]  I'll find the bud, you know, I'll find some other, mix them all up.
[03:28.190 --> 03:30.190]  Call it good stuff.
[03:31.130 --> 03:37.130]  You know, I've never been one to categorize things.
[03:37.130 --> 03:41.130]  I guess it's the schooling that gets people like that, you know?
[03:41.130 --> 03:44.130]  You know that, this is the best or that.
[03:44.130 --> 03:49.130]  Well, high time started with, you know, the Cannabis Cup, you know.
[03:49.130 --> 03:52.130]  And if you grow the best and all the judges will pick your thing.
[03:52.130 --> 03:54.130]  You know how you win the Cannabis Cup?
[03:54.130 --> 03:56.130]  You pay them.
[03:56.130 --> 03:57.130]  I've heard that.
[03:57.130 --> 03:59.130]  I've definitely heard that.
[04:00.070 --> 04:02.070]  You pay them, just like any contest.
[04:02.070 --> 04:06.070]  You know, you can corrupt any contest with money.
[04:06.070 --> 04:08.070]  With, yeah.
[04:08.070 --> 04:12.070]  Oh, God, with absolute power comes, yeah, corruption, absolutely.
[04:12.070 --> 04:15.070]  There's a quote somewhere in there.
[04:15.070 --> 04:16.070]  Yeah.
[04:16.070 --> 04:18.070]  Glossing over it now, right?
[04:18.070 --> 04:22.070]  But, yeah, and that's the cool thing about some of the smaller contests.
[04:22.070 --> 04:26.070]  Unfortunately, it doesn't give you, you know, that social media clout.
[04:27.010 --> 04:30.010]  If you have good integrity, you have longevity,
[04:30.010 --> 04:33.010]  that word of mouth is really your best way to the top
[04:33.010 --> 04:36.010]  because it's built on a solid foundation, I believe.
[04:36.010 --> 04:39.010]  Well, here's the thing, you know, Biblically speaking,
[04:39.010 --> 04:45.010]  when they say, know the truth and the truth shall set you free,
[04:45.010 --> 04:48.010]  that's so powerful.
[04:48.010 --> 04:50.010]  That is so powerful.
[04:50.010 --> 04:55.010]  And that's the great thing about the weed, you know.
[04:55.950 --> 04:58.950]  Just tell the truth about it, you know.
[04:58.950 --> 05:01.950]  And that's all you ever have to do.
[05:01.950 --> 05:04.950]  I found out, you know, being a comedian,
[05:04.950 --> 05:08.950]  we take the truth and we use it.
[05:08.950 --> 05:14.950]  We manipulate everything around a truth, you know.
[05:14.950 --> 05:20.950]  And it's like different views of the same truth.
[05:21.890 --> 05:23.890]  And if you...
[05:23.890 --> 05:28.890]  That's a very powerful statement, like know the truth.
[05:28.890 --> 05:32.890]  Because that's everything in the universe,
[05:32.890 --> 05:36.890]  is life or the spiritual world.
[05:36.890 --> 05:40.890]  All those worlds put together if you know the truth.
[05:40.890 --> 05:44.890]  Just think about an architect, you know,
[05:44.890 --> 05:48.890]  and he's building, say, the pyramids.
[05:49.830 --> 05:53.830]  And if he doesn't know the truth about how long they should be
[05:53.830 --> 05:57.830]  and how high it should be and what the angle should be,
[05:57.830 --> 05:59.830]  those are truths.
[05:59.830 --> 06:03.830]  And if he doesn't know the truth and he builds them
[06:03.830 --> 06:06.830]  without, you know, erroneously,
[06:06.830 --> 06:10.830]  then that structure, whatever it is, will fall apart.
[06:10.830 --> 06:13.830]  The nature will take it out.
[06:13.830 --> 06:17.830]  Because really the truth is being in one with nature.
[06:18.770 --> 06:20.770]  That's the truth.
[06:20.770 --> 06:22.770]  Nature has a lot of things figured out.
[06:22.770 --> 06:27.770]  And I like that, you know, truth is a never-ending quest as well.
[06:27.770 --> 06:29.770]  There are many things that we have thought, you know,
[06:29.770 --> 06:32.770]  from the kid's brain that was truth.
[06:32.770 --> 06:34.770]  And then we've learned a new truth later.
[06:34.770 --> 06:38.770]  And I think cannabis kind of helps us maybe sit and ponder those things
[06:38.770 --> 06:40.770]  or maybe it unlocks different doors.
[06:40.770 --> 06:45.770]  But the quest for truth can also be, you know, obtained through cannabis.
[06:45.770 --> 06:47.770]  Yes, yes.
[06:48.710 --> 06:57.710]  Lying is really a form of laziness, you know, a lack of energy.
[06:57.710 --> 07:00.710]  Because, and then what happens?
[07:00.710 --> 07:05.710]  You create so many problems that all that energy you think you saved,
[07:05.710 --> 07:07.710]  you've blown it.
[07:07.710 --> 07:13.710]  Because now you not only tell a lie, but now you have to defend it.
[07:14.650 --> 07:18.650]  Or you have to pretend, or say you never said it.
[07:18.650 --> 07:20.650]  You have to remember.
[07:20.650 --> 07:22.650]  And compound another lie.
[07:22.650 --> 07:24.650]  And put another lie.
[07:24.650 --> 07:28.650]  So you build these straw houses basically, you know.
[07:28.650 --> 07:31.650]  And huff and puff and they get blown away.
[07:31.650 --> 07:39.650]  So the truth, knowing the truth in everything, everything.
[07:40.590 --> 07:47.590]  Be it music, be it poetry, be it literature, be it art.
[07:47.590 --> 07:50.590]  It's all there.
[07:50.590 --> 07:56.590]  And when you find the truth, it resonates so beautifully.
[07:56.590 --> 07:59.590]  That, you know, like a bell.
[07:59.590 --> 08:04.590]  You know, you hit that, it's a perfect sound that comes out.
[08:05.530 --> 08:11.530]  And to me, that's the only time perfection really has meaning.
[08:11.530 --> 08:15.530]  When it's a sound, you know.
[08:15.530 --> 08:19.530]  It's a never ending quest.
[08:19.530 --> 08:22.530]  And sometimes that truth comes with imperfections.
[08:22.530 --> 08:25.530]  You know, there may be a little ding on your cymbal.
[08:25.530 --> 08:27.530]  But you still hear it ring and resonate, you know.
[08:27.530 --> 08:29.530]  It's spreading its sound wave.
[08:29.530 --> 08:31.530]  No, but it tells you.
[08:31.530 --> 08:33.530]  It's a parameters.
[08:34.470 --> 08:36.470]  You know, you get too far out, oh, that's going to happen.
[08:36.470 --> 08:38.470]  You get too far out this way, oh, that's going to happen.
[08:38.470 --> 08:40.470]  So just staying in the middle.
[08:40.470 --> 08:44.470]  Every once in a while, you've got to hit the edges to find out where you are.
[08:44.470 --> 08:48.470]  You know, are you that close to the edge or are you in the center?
[08:48.470 --> 08:50.470]  Yeah.
[08:50.470 --> 08:52.470]  Are you hearing the reverb and the echo off the wall?
[08:52.470 --> 08:54.470]  Or are you really hearing it, you know, open?
[08:54.470 --> 08:56.470]  Yeah.
[08:56.470 --> 09:02.470]  I'm a, you know, one of the things, well, many things I've loved about your interviews is you're multi-talented.
[09:03.410 --> 09:05.410]  I'm an audio engineer by trade.
[09:05.410 --> 09:07.410]  So that is what I did for 20 years.
[09:07.410 --> 09:09.410]  And cannabis is kind of the space that I'm in these days.
[09:09.410 --> 09:23.410]  But hearing a lot of your experience in the music industry and just playing instruments, being a musician, writing music, that is, you know, another way to almost seek truth.
[09:23.410 --> 09:25.410]  Well, yeah, for sure.
[09:25.410 --> 09:27.410]  For sure.
[09:27.410 --> 09:29.410]  I backed up enough singers to learn something.
[09:29.410 --> 09:31.410]  You know.
[09:32.350 --> 09:34.350]  You can't learn a song without learning something.
[09:34.350 --> 09:36.350]  You know.
[09:36.350 --> 09:42.350]  Even if it's not your song, you know, it's nice to learn the changes and everything.
[09:42.350 --> 09:48.350]  And then I learned that there's no limit to what I can do.
[09:48.350 --> 09:50.350]  No.
[09:50.350 --> 09:52.350]  It's just that, like, I never ever thought I could sing.
[09:52.350 --> 09:54.350]  When I was a kid, I loved to sing.
[09:54.350 --> 09:56.350]  But I never sang in front of people or never sang as a singer.
[09:57.290 --> 09:59.290]  You know, I never took it serious.
[09:59.290 --> 10:01.290]  It was just something that, oh, that's fun.
[10:01.290 --> 10:03.290]  We can do that.
[10:03.290 --> 10:05.290]  You know.
[10:05.290 --> 10:07.290]  Because growing up poor, you really don't have that play time some kids have now or any times.
[10:07.290 --> 10:09.290]  When you grow up poor, you've got survival time.
[10:09.290 --> 10:11.290]  Yeah.
[10:11.290 --> 10:13.290]  Yeah.
[10:13.290 --> 10:15.290]  Yeah.
[10:15.290 --> 10:17.290]  You know, you've got to play hard.
[10:17.290 --> 10:19.290]  You've got to play hard.
[10:19.290 --> 10:21.290]  You've got to play hard.
[10:21.290 --> 10:23.290]  You've got to play hard.
[10:23.290 --> 10:25.290]  You've got to play hard.
[10:26.230 --> 10:28.230]  You've got to play hard.
[10:28.230 --> 10:30.230]  You've got to play hard.
[10:30.230 --> 10:32.230]  You've got to bring in the wood to burn in the wood stove.
[10:32.230 --> 10:34.230]  You've got to bring in the water to put on the, you know, for cooking and dishes and washing.
[10:34.230 --> 10:36.230]  And then fire up the Coleman lamp for the light.
[10:36.230 --> 10:38.230]  You know.
[10:38.230 --> 10:40.230]  There was a lot of things to do.
[10:40.230 --> 10:42.230]  And so when you had time, you could do that while you listened to music.
[10:42.230 --> 10:44.230]  You know.
[10:44.230 --> 10:48.030]  There was a lot of things to do.
[10:48.030 --> 10:53.910]  And so when you had time, you could do that while you listen to music.
[10:53.910 --> 10:56.710]  You know, you can always listen to music when you do that.
[10:56.710 --> 10:59.790]  And in the country, there's always music.
[10:59.790 --> 11:05.190]  It may not be coming from the radio, but it's coming from the earth.
[11:05.190 --> 11:13.790]  You know, the birds, the animals, the wind, the sounds of this planet.
[11:13.790 --> 11:15.430]  It's music.
[11:15.430 --> 11:22.870]  And that was the environment that I grew up in.
[11:22.870 --> 11:29.830]  And so being able to do a little bit of everything, that's country.
[11:29.830 --> 11:37.390]  It's almost like living in the country is like being with a movie crew, you know, shooting
[11:37.390 --> 11:39.510]  a movie.
[11:39.510 --> 11:43.670]  Because a low budget movie crew, everybody does everything.
[11:43.670 --> 11:44.670]  Right.
[11:44.670 --> 11:45.670]  Right.
[11:45.670 --> 11:51.030]  So you might be the cameraman one day, you might be the roadie, you might be the grip,
[11:51.030 --> 11:53.030]  you might, you know, you do everything.
[11:53.030 --> 11:56.470]  The sound engineer, you do it all.
[11:56.470 --> 11:57.470]  Because you have to.
[11:57.470 --> 11:58.470]  Yeah.
[11:58.630 --> 12:07.030]  And so if you're lucky enough to sort of get to the point where you specialize in one thing,
[12:07.030 --> 12:08.710]  that can be fun.
[12:08.710 --> 12:20.150]  But in my life, I was forced to do these things, you know, forced in such, well, it had to
[12:20.150 --> 12:22.150]  get done, you know.
[12:22.150 --> 12:23.150]  Right.
[12:23.150 --> 12:24.150]  Yeah.
[12:24.150 --> 12:25.150]  Yeah.
[12:25.590 --> 12:27.790]  And that, you know, nature's music is there.
[12:27.790 --> 12:30.110]  You have to allow yourself to be able to hear it.
[12:30.110 --> 12:35.470]  You know, I grew up in the city as a kid and in my 20s.
[12:35.470 --> 12:39.350]  And I didn't necessarily appreciate nature until later.
[12:39.350 --> 12:41.350]  And now, you know, that's all I can get.
[12:41.350 --> 12:45.550]  I hear these things, I see these things, it reminds me kind of of the magic that is really
[12:45.550 --> 12:46.590]  out there.
[12:46.590 --> 12:48.510]  If we allow ourselves to see it.
[12:48.510 --> 12:50.190]  Well, that's nice.
[12:50.190 --> 12:51.190]  Yeah.
[12:51.190 --> 12:54.590]  You were allowed yourself to get hungry before you ate.
[12:55.030 --> 12:56.510]  That's really nice.
[12:56.510 --> 12:58.510]  I was the opposite.
[12:58.510 --> 13:04.910]  I lived in the country, but oh my God, the city was so fascinating to me.
[13:04.910 --> 13:11.550]  And when I ended up with a friend that had a friend in the city, and then we started
[13:11.550 --> 13:18.070]  hanging out, you know, that time when you're wandering the back alleys, you know, no one
[13:18.070 --> 13:19.070]  pays attention to you.
[13:19.070 --> 13:20.070]  Hey, kid, get out of here.
[13:20.070 --> 13:23.790]  You know, I was at that age.
[13:23.990 --> 13:29.870]  And we roamed all the alleys of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
[13:29.870 --> 13:33.950]  And that was the city that wow, it's a little cow town.
[13:33.950 --> 13:39.230]  But yeah, I had a great, I had a beautiful, beautiful childhood.
[13:39.230 --> 13:40.230]  Incredible.
[13:40.230 --> 13:43.030]  It's so exciting.
[13:43.030 --> 13:47.510]  And it's, you know, it's definitely developed a lot of character and integrity.
[13:47.510 --> 13:51.110]  And like you said, when things need to get done, you really kind of have to be a jack
[13:51.110 --> 13:52.150]  of all trades.
[13:52.150 --> 13:53.230]  So that probably has helped you.
[13:53.670 --> 13:54.670]  I know that's helped me.
[13:54.670 --> 13:58.550]  You know, when I was doing music, I had to, you know, make flyers.
[13:58.550 --> 14:02.270]  So I had to learn art, you know, and then that kind of had to turn into video production.
[14:02.270 --> 14:06.350]  And it all comes together when you're the only one in the kitchen, you know?
[14:06.350 --> 14:10.350]  Yeah, and you can do it and you can do it and you want it done, you get it done.
[14:10.350 --> 14:13.950]  Yeah, that's why, you know, when people say to me, how can I get a podcast?
[14:13.950 --> 14:19.230]  I go, well, you won't get one by asking me.
[14:20.230 --> 14:29.230]  Yeah, it's, I also managed musicians touring DJs for a while from other countries.
[14:29.230 --> 14:32.230]  Were you a promoter or a manager?
[14:32.230 --> 14:33.230]  Manager.
[14:33.230 --> 14:34.230]  Oh, yeah, just manager.
[14:34.230 --> 14:37.230]  So you got their money, you mean?
[14:37.230 --> 14:42.230]  Yeah, I called people that I never knew or met and said, I know this person and they're
[14:42.230 --> 14:44.230]  coming and I need your flight share.
[14:44.230 --> 14:45.230]  So send me your flight share.
[14:45.230 --> 14:47.230]  And he stays in this kind of a hotel.
[14:47.230 --> 14:48.230]  So make sure you book that.
[14:48.230 --> 14:50.230]  Never met the people, but it works out.
[14:50.230 --> 14:51.230]  It works out.
[14:53.230 --> 14:55.230]  And I kind of forgot where I was going with.
[14:56.230 --> 14:58.230]  No, we're a jack of all trades.
[14:58.230 --> 14:59.230]  Oh, yeah.
[14:59.230 --> 15:01.230]  Having to do what you do.
[15:01.230 --> 15:04.230]  Yeah, you got you got to do it all.
[15:06.230 --> 15:14.230]  You know, real quick on the on the audio portion, I was curious, do you own a record player?
[15:14.230 --> 15:15.230]  Are you a vinyl guy?
[15:19.230 --> 15:21.230]  Not a loyal one.
[15:22.230 --> 15:25.230]  I'm an accidental anything.
[15:26.230 --> 15:31.230]  If it happens to be there and it works, I'll mess with it for a while.
[15:31.230 --> 15:37.230]  I found a record player downstairs and I haven't found a place to put it yet.
[15:38.230 --> 15:42.230]  But no, we were, you know, Cheech and I, we were.
[15:42.230 --> 15:45.230]  That's all we did for seven years.
[15:46.230 --> 15:53.230]  So we did in the studio and just creating all sorts of fun things, you know.
[15:53.230 --> 15:54.230]  God, it was great.
[15:55.230 --> 16:01.230]  I know I just got a publishing company with my son just recently.
[16:01.230 --> 16:14.230]  And we're going to go into the electronic poetry, you know, spoken word.
[16:14.230 --> 16:16.230]  That would be awesome.
[16:16.230 --> 16:22.230]  I've been I've been writing and I'm a writer, so I just write.
[16:22.230 --> 16:23.230]  I'll hear a phrase.
[16:23.230 --> 16:26.230]  I'll write it down in my phone.
[16:26.230 --> 16:27.230]  It's so funny.
[16:27.230 --> 16:29.230]  Oh, by the way, where is my phone?
[16:29.230 --> 16:31.230]  Then I realized I'm talking to it.
[16:32.230 --> 16:33.230]  Where's my glasses?
[16:34.230 --> 16:35.230]  Where's my glasses?
[16:36.230 --> 16:37.230]  Done that.
[16:37.230 --> 16:38.230]  Keys are in the hand.
[16:38.230 --> 16:39.230]  Damn it.
[16:39.230 --> 16:41.230]  They're handy tools.
[16:41.230 --> 16:47.230]  Hopefully, you know, I've learned to always make backups, like make sure you back it up to the cloud or something.
[16:47.230 --> 16:48.230]  Because sometimes.
[16:48.230 --> 16:50.230]  Sometimes that's all you got.
[16:50.230 --> 16:51.230]  Yeah.
[16:51.230 --> 16:52.230]  Yeah.
[16:52.230 --> 16:54.230]  You lose you lose the hard copies.
[16:54.230 --> 16:55.230]  Do you collect everything?
[16:55.230 --> 16:56.230]  I do.
[16:56.230 --> 16:59.230]  I collect vinyl still because I DJ for a long time.
[16:59.230 --> 17:01.230]  So I still have a big vinyl collection as well.
[17:01.230 --> 17:05.230]  And so is it is it like organized collection?
[17:05.230 --> 17:06.230]  Yes.
[17:06.230 --> 17:07.230]  OK.
[17:07.230 --> 17:08.230]  Yeah.
[17:08.230 --> 17:10.230]  You you you you're well, you're audio.
[17:10.230 --> 17:12.230]  So you have to have the numbers.
[17:12.230 --> 17:13.230]  Yeah.
[17:13.230 --> 17:15.230]  And you have to know where everything is.
[17:15.230 --> 17:16.230]  Yeah.
[17:16.230 --> 17:21.230]  I'm I'm more the conceptual artist.
[17:22.230 --> 17:37.230]  You know, I realized I'm more of a conceptual artist than anything, because there's no bounds on on art, you know, and and there's no limit.
[17:37.230 --> 17:41.230]  No, there is no there is no wrong and there are no lines to stay within.
[17:41.230 --> 17:42.230]  Yeah.
[17:42.230 --> 17:43.230]  Yeah.
[17:44.230 --> 17:51.230]  And if you can think it, if you can imagine it and have it built.
[17:52.230 --> 18:19.230]  That's why my thing now is I'm looking to form a movie company and in the movie company, I'm going to create projects that go anywhere from five to 20, 30 years, because reality, any movie.
[18:19.230 --> 18:20.230]  I don't care what it is.
[18:20.230 --> 18:22.230]  It's going to take a couple of years.
[18:22.230 --> 18:23.230]  Yeah.
[18:23.230 --> 18:32.230]  Unless something, you know, something magical happens and you need it done in a month or something.
[18:32.230 --> 18:36.230]  But like up in smoke, we shot up in smoke.
[18:36.230 --> 18:39.230]  Literally less than a month.
[18:39.230 --> 18:43.230]  It was shot that fast.
[18:43.230 --> 18:47.230]  So many great movies have come from schedules like that, though.
[18:47.230 --> 18:48.230]  Yeah.
[18:48.230 --> 18:49.230]  Unintentionally.
[18:49.230 --> 18:51.230]  But I think that's part of the magic.
[18:51.230 --> 18:52.230]  Maybe.
[18:52.230 --> 18:58.230]  No, what it was is that we it's like it's like catching butterflies.
[18:58.230 --> 19:03.230]  You know, we got them in a short period of time because we knew how to do it.
[19:03.230 --> 19:06.230]  We had we were all ready to do it.
[19:06.230 --> 19:10.230]  You know, that movie had been done, worked on seven years on the stage.
[19:11.230 --> 19:20.230]  And so when it came time to shoot it as a movie, it was a no brainer, basically.
[19:20.230 --> 19:22.230]  And that's up in smoke.
[19:22.230 --> 19:29.230]  See now, now the next movie, there's a lot of thought put into that.
[19:30.230 --> 19:32.230]  And then the movies after that.
[19:34.230 --> 19:39.230]  It dwindled until we got to the Corsican Brothers.
[19:39.230 --> 19:47.230]  And then that's when my directorial skill genius came out.
[19:47.230 --> 19:50.230]  You got the tall chair on set.
[19:50.230 --> 19:52.230]  I said you had the tall chair on set.
[19:52.230 --> 19:54.230]  The director's chair.
[19:54.230 --> 19:55.230]  I had the only chair.
[19:55.230 --> 19:57.230]  I had the only chair.
[19:57.230 --> 20:02.230]  And and that that really is what broke Cheech and Chong up.
[20:02.230 --> 20:03.230]  That was it.
[20:03.230 --> 20:04.230]  That was the last thing we did.
[20:04.230 --> 20:07.230]  Yeah, it was the Corsican Brothers.
[20:07.230 --> 20:11.230]  And it really was like end of an era, you know.
[20:11.230 --> 20:13.230]  Of the Cheech and Chong movies.
[20:13.230 --> 20:14.230]  It was the end.
[20:14.230 --> 20:17.230]  I never knew it at the time.
[20:17.230 --> 20:22.230]  But but I never ever thought of us as a series or anything, you know.
[20:22.230 --> 20:24.230]  I don't think that way.
[20:24.230 --> 20:29.230]  I always think of the, I don't know, the immediate.
[20:29.230 --> 20:31.230]  Today, yes.
[20:31.230 --> 20:32.230]  Yeah, yeah.
[20:32.230 --> 20:34.230]  And it turns out, wow, that's great.
[20:34.230 --> 20:38.230]  Like, like we never intended to legalize weed.
[20:38.230 --> 20:43.230]  Although everything we did was pointed in that direction, you know.
[20:43.230 --> 20:50.230]  So, so it's another example of being led around by the higher power, you know.
[20:50.230 --> 20:53.230]  And that's what that's really what happened to me.
[20:53.230 --> 20:55.230]  Still happening to me.
[20:55.230 --> 21:05.230]  I'm so used to taking orders that it kind of fooled my wife.
[21:05.230 --> 21:08.230]  It fooled everybody for a minute there.
[21:08.230 --> 21:13.230]  And then, but the real self popped up at the right time.
[21:13.230 --> 21:14.230]  Good.
[21:14.230 --> 21:15.230]  Yeah.
[21:15.230 --> 21:16.230]  Good.
[21:16.230 --> 21:17.230]  Well, yeah, it is.
[21:17.230 --> 21:20.230]  It's a beautiful and mysterious trip.
[21:20.230 --> 21:21.230]  Yeah.
[21:21.230 --> 21:25.230]  And then flow, you know, there's relationships that go a different direction.
[21:25.230 --> 21:27.230]  And then, you know, sometimes they reunite.
[21:27.230 --> 21:30.230]  That's kind of the beauty of time.
[21:30.230 --> 21:31.230]  Yeah.
[21:31.230 --> 21:32.230]  And the beauty of keeping an open mind.
[21:32.230 --> 21:33.230]  Yeah.
[21:33.230 --> 21:39.230]  Well, we're, yeah, I just realized we're in the aquarium of life.
[21:39.230 --> 21:43.230]  And we're just floating around and we have moments.
[21:43.230 --> 21:47.230]  Sometimes those moments, you know, stay with you for a while.
[21:47.230 --> 21:48.230]  Yeah.
[21:48.230 --> 21:50.230]  There is beautiful moments.
[21:50.230 --> 21:51.230]  Yeah.
[21:51.230 --> 21:57.230]  Well, one moment, you know, that I kind of want to reiterate for people, you know,
[21:57.230 --> 22:00.230]  we're talking about Up and Smoke, we're talking about some of the other movies.
[22:00.230 --> 22:04.230]  Now, there's a lot of people out there who know these movies.
[22:04.230 --> 22:07.230]  You've had such a wonderful and varied career.
[22:07.230 --> 22:08.230]  It's great.
[22:08.230 --> 22:09.230]  I'm almost interested.
[22:09.230 --> 22:10.230]  It's like that question.
[22:10.230 --> 22:13.230]  So at Comic-Con, which character does everybody think you are?
[22:13.230 --> 22:16.230]  And it's probably like a hundred different characters.
[22:17.230 --> 22:19.230]  It depends, you know.
[22:19.230 --> 22:22.230]  The younger ones see me as Leo.
[22:22.230 --> 22:23.230]  Yes.
[22:23.230 --> 22:24.230]  From the 70s show.
[22:24.230 --> 22:25.230]  Yes.
[22:25.230 --> 22:26.230]  Yeah.
[22:26.230 --> 22:27.230]  That's all they see is Leo.
[22:27.230 --> 22:31.230]  Because really, that's what I was, you know, in the past.
[22:31.230 --> 22:32.230]  Yeah.
[22:32.230 --> 22:35.230]  What's his name?
[22:35.230 --> 22:37.230]  Anthony Stoner.
[22:37.230 --> 22:41.230]  You get a job by sundown at Hans Kippenjob.
[22:41.230 --> 22:43.230]  Yeah.
[22:43.230 --> 22:45.230]  I love that character.
[22:45.230 --> 22:51.230]  Because he really was me, you know.
[22:51.230 --> 22:53.230]  Just me playing.
[22:53.230 --> 22:54.230]  That's fun.
[22:54.230 --> 22:56.230]  Playing.
[22:56.230 --> 22:58.230]  So stoned.
[22:58.230 --> 23:01.230]  See, I was an example of what happens if you smoke too much weed.
[23:01.230 --> 23:05.230]  Was there a lot of ad-libbing there?
[23:05.230 --> 23:07.230]  Oh, everything.
[23:07.230 --> 23:08.230]  Everything.
[23:08.230 --> 23:09.230]  Wow.
[23:09.230 --> 23:10.230]  Everything.
[23:10.230 --> 23:12.230]  We never.
[23:12.230 --> 23:14.230]  What's your name?
[23:15.230 --> 23:16.230]  Strother Martin.
[23:16.230 --> 23:19.230]  Wrote every line of that.
[23:19.230 --> 23:21.230]  You get a job by sundown.
[23:21.230 --> 23:22.230]  That's him.
[23:22.230 --> 23:23.230]  That was his line.
[23:23.230 --> 23:25.230]  Stacy Keach.
[23:25.230 --> 23:26.230]  Stodanko.
[23:26.230 --> 23:27.230]  Yeah.
[23:27.230 --> 23:28.230]  Yeah.
[23:28.230 --> 23:32.230]  You know what kind of meat.
[23:32.230 --> 23:33.230]  Pre-seed on Friday.
[23:33.230 --> 23:35.230]  None.
[23:35.230 --> 23:36.230]  None.
[23:36.230 --> 23:38.230]  That was Stacy.
[23:38.230 --> 23:40.230]  Everybody ad-libbed.
[23:41.230 --> 23:43.230]  I would write a little bit.
[23:43.230 --> 23:49.230]  But a lot of them were comical situations that Keach had.
[23:49.230 --> 23:55.230]  Or Jade East, one of the girls in the band, had.
[23:55.230 --> 23:57.230]  She told a story about Alex.
[23:57.230 --> 24:02.230]  And the next thing you know, it becomes a big part of the movie.
[24:02.230 --> 24:03.230]  Yeah.
[24:03.230 --> 24:04.230]  It was.
[24:04.230 --> 24:07.230]  And then I wanted to introduce punk music to the world.
[24:08.230 --> 24:09.230]  Which I did.
[24:09.230 --> 24:11.230]  With the punk bands.
[24:11.230 --> 24:16.230]  And yeah, there was a lot of things that.
[24:16.230 --> 24:21.230]  We were like the first documentarian kind of movie.
[24:21.230 --> 24:24.230]  You know, where it was more of a.
[24:24.230 --> 24:25.230]  Instead of a.
[24:25.230 --> 24:27.230]  A fictional set up.
[24:27.230 --> 24:28.230]  It was.
[24:28.230 --> 24:32.230]  These are real scenes that are happening all over America.
[24:32.230 --> 24:34.230]  You know, especially in Hollywood.
[24:34.230 --> 24:35.230]  Yeah.
[24:36.230 --> 24:38.230]  So we're just going to show you one scene.
[24:38.230 --> 24:39.230]  And it's going to be on screen.
[24:39.230 --> 24:41.230]  And you know.
[24:41.230 --> 24:42.230]  And that.
[24:42.230 --> 24:44.230]  And really, that was.
[24:44.230 --> 24:47.230]  That was the intent of Up In Smoke.
[24:47.230 --> 24:50.230]  And then.
[24:50.230 --> 24:52.230]  Then we couldn't get a movie.
[24:52.230 --> 24:54.230]  After Up In Smoke.
[24:54.230 --> 25:00.230]  Because Lou Adler, the producer or the director at the time of choice.
[25:00.230 --> 25:02.230]  You know.
[25:02.230 --> 25:04.230]  We had differences.
[25:04.230 --> 25:05.230]  Okay.
[25:05.230 --> 25:07.230]  With the ending of the movie.
[25:07.230 --> 25:09.230]  And so we kind of split.
[25:09.230 --> 25:11.230]  I wrote the ending for the movie.
[25:11.230 --> 25:13.230]  But I wouldn't tell Lou what it was.
[25:13.230 --> 25:16.230]  And I had to direct it myself.
[25:16.230 --> 25:18.230]  And so I get a special.
[25:18.230 --> 25:19.230]  On.
[25:19.230 --> 25:23.230]  What's it on.
[25:23.230 --> 25:26.230]  On something.
[25:26.230 --> 25:29.230]  Writing credit.
[25:29.230 --> 25:30.230]  Okay.
[25:30.230 --> 25:31.230]  Right.
[25:32.230 --> 25:34.230]  No directing directors credit.
[25:34.230 --> 25:35.230]  You know.
[25:35.230 --> 25:36.230]  But.
[25:36.230 --> 25:38.230]  But that was that was immaterial.
[25:38.230 --> 25:42.230]  You know, that's that's part of the dance that you do in Hollywood anyway.
[25:42.230 --> 25:43.230]  You know.
[25:43.230 --> 25:45.230]  That's.
[25:45.230 --> 25:46.230]  Habanera.
[25:46.230 --> 25:47.230]  You know.
[25:47.230 --> 25:50.230]  That was great that you were able to get in there and do that.
[25:50.230 --> 25:51.230]  I know.
[25:51.230 --> 25:52.230]  No, I had to.
[25:52.230 --> 25:53.230]  Yeah.
[25:53.230 --> 25:54.230]  I had to.
[25:54.230 --> 25:56.230]  You know, other than that.
[25:56.230 --> 25:58.230]  That would have been a disaster.
[25:59.230 --> 26:00.230]  But when I saw that.
[26:00.230 --> 26:03.230]  Well, like someone doing your act, you know.
[26:03.230 --> 26:06.230]  And then when you get to the finish and say, okay, you leave.
[26:06.230 --> 26:08.230]  I'll finish the eye for you.
[26:08.230 --> 26:09.230]  Can't do that.
[26:09.230 --> 26:10.230]  No, no.
[26:10.230 --> 26:11.230]  We've.
[26:11.230 --> 26:12.230]  Yeah.
[26:12.230 --> 26:13.230]  I'm a huge Twin Peaks fan.
[26:13.230 --> 26:14.230]  David Lynch.
[26:14.230 --> 26:18.230]  Wrote that, you know, back in the nineties and season one was his seasons.
[26:18.230 --> 26:21.230]  Two was the studios and there's a drastic difference.
[26:21.230 --> 26:22.230]  Yeah.
[26:22.230 --> 26:25.230]  I'm glad you were able to finish it in your vision.
[26:25.230 --> 26:28.230]  Well, I turned down TV, you know, before the movie we got,
[26:28.230 --> 26:30.230]  we got the biggest offer in television.
[26:30.230 --> 26:34.230]  Oh, and it turned out to be Chico and the man with Freddie Prince.
[26:34.230 --> 26:35.230]  Huh?
[26:35.230 --> 26:38.230]  But NBC followed teaching Sean around for a year.
[26:38.230 --> 26:40.230]  And he wrote.
[26:40.230 --> 26:43.230]  Chico and the man based on a couple of skits that teach.
[26:43.230 --> 26:44.230]  And I used to do.
[26:44.230 --> 26:45.230]  But.
[26:45.230 --> 26:48.230]  But the television show they wanted us to do, you know,
[26:49.230 --> 26:52.230]  You can put us down to two characters, you know?
[26:52.230 --> 26:56.230]  So, so I turned it down and then we did all the movies and then,
[26:56.230 --> 26:58.230]  and then we got into TV, you know.
[26:58.230 --> 27:00.230]  Which, which is okay.
[27:00.230 --> 27:03.230]  But had we just think of it, had we done that Freddie Prince thing.
[27:03.230 --> 27:05.230]  No one would.
[27:05.230 --> 27:06.230]  Have any idea.
[27:06.230 --> 27:07.230]  Yeah.
[27:07.230 --> 27:08.230]  No one would have.
[27:08.230 --> 27:11.230]  I mean, I think it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,
[27:11.230 --> 27:14.230]  it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,
[27:14.230 --> 27:17.230]  it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,
[27:17.230 --> 27:21.230]  It would be remembered like Freddie Prince.
[27:21.230 --> 27:22.230]  Yeah.
[27:22.230 --> 27:23.230]  It's interesting.
[27:23.230 --> 27:25.230]  And it's all going for the money, by the way.
[27:25.230 --> 27:30.230]  You know, because that TV money is very attractive, you know?
[27:30.230 --> 27:31.230]  Right.
[27:31.230 --> 27:36.230]  But I've never been into, into anything for just for the money.
[27:36.230 --> 27:40.230]  Conceptual artists can't be confined.
[27:40.230 --> 27:43.230]  No, not at all.
[27:43.230 --> 27:44.230]  Not at all.
[27:44.230 --> 27:49.230]  In fact, I'm finding ways now to literally use the system,
[27:53.650 --> 27:58.650]  the movie system, to help the immigration problem,
[28:00.570 --> 28:01.710]  for instance.
[28:01.710 --> 28:02.550]  Good.
[28:02.550 --> 28:06.310]  See, for instance, I'll give you a slight example.
[28:06.310 --> 28:11.110]  I want to do a project where we document the march
[28:11.110 --> 28:16.110]  in South America from Guatemala and those countries
[28:16.630 --> 28:21.630]  into Tijuana, the march that Trump freaked out,
[28:22.430 --> 28:25.070]  everybody freaked out, and we tried to do it.
[28:25.070 --> 28:28.230]  Now, what I want to do with my movie company,
[28:28.230 --> 28:32.550]  I want to hire every marcher that was in that march
[28:32.550 --> 28:35.150]  and bring them into America as actors
[28:36.270 --> 28:39.390]  and bring their families in as actors
[28:39.390 --> 28:42.470]  and have them all employed by the movie company,
[28:42.470 --> 28:47.470]  Peace Fight Pictures, as actors, as children,
[28:48.230 --> 28:52.430]  as spouses, as grandmas, as extras.
[28:52.430 --> 28:56.350]  There's always gonna be work in a movie studio.
[28:56.350 --> 28:59.990]  There's always work besides acting.
[28:59.990 --> 29:00.810]  Yeah.
[29:00.810 --> 29:04.990]  But the main thing is I want the story of their migration
[29:05.030 --> 29:09.910]  because to me, walking 1,500 miles or whatever they walked
[29:09.910 --> 29:13.390]  is the ultimate audition to me.
[29:16.550 --> 29:19.550]  Now, we will bring them into the movie company
[29:19.550 --> 29:22.790]  and ask you about your journey,
[29:22.790 --> 29:25.710]  and if you're a writer or whatever you are,
[29:25.710 --> 29:29.670]  we got a place for you in our movie company,
[29:29.670 --> 29:32.630]  and then they'll all join the guilds,
[29:32.790 --> 29:34.830]  all the proper guilds.
[29:34.830 --> 29:38.130]  The art department will find proper housing for them,
[29:39.790 --> 29:43.790]  and there's gonna be schools, beautiful schools,
[29:43.790 --> 29:46.150]  that everybody will want to go to
[29:46.150 --> 29:51.150]  because we're not only just teaching English or whatever,
[29:51.470 --> 29:53.670]  English, we're teaching acting.
[29:53.670 --> 29:56.190]  You know, it's an acting school, a music school,
[29:56.190 --> 29:59.270]  depending on where, what lies.
[29:59.270 --> 30:01.990]  And by the way, there's a legal school too
[30:02.350 --> 30:04.470]  because we're gonna need those legal minds
[30:04.470 --> 30:09.070]  to keep everything working in harmony.
[30:09.070 --> 30:14.070]  Now, I'm going to start with the story of Cheech and Chong,
[30:14.550 --> 30:17.630]  the prequels of Cheech and Chong
[30:17.630 --> 30:21.790]  before Cheech was ever Cheech and Chong was ever Chong,
[30:21.790 --> 30:23.990]  and then we're going back into the various countries
[30:23.990 --> 30:26.470]  where our ancestors came from
[30:26.470 --> 30:29.830]  and then document their stories of their migration.
[30:29.830 --> 30:32.070]  And it's just gonna keep going,
[30:32.070 --> 30:37.070]  and then we're gonna also document the gains that we made
[30:38.550 --> 30:40.950]  by bringing these people in and being that.
[30:40.950 --> 30:44.710]  We're gonna show that story of success
[30:44.710 --> 30:47.150]  because if you get them young enough,
[30:47.150 --> 30:50.390]  by the time they're 10 years go by,
[30:50.390 --> 30:53.710]  they are such an asset to America,
[30:53.710 --> 30:56.270]  and that's what we're looking for.
[30:56.270 --> 30:57.590]  That's what any country's looking at.
[30:57.590 --> 30:59.990]  That's what every movie company's looking for.
[30:59.990 --> 31:03.030]  They're looking for the stars, the extras,
[31:03.030 --> 31:05.670]  the grips, the carpenters, everything.
[31:05.670 --> 31:09.270]  So if we can turn a movie company
[31:09.270 --> 31:13.750]  into the greatest way of vetting people
[31:13.750 --> 31:15.750]  coming into the country,
[31:15.750 --> 31:18.950]  that model can spread around the world.
[31:19.790 --> 31:24.790]  And so that, because when you document, say,
[31:25.510 --> 31:28.110]  an immigrant with the movie company,
[31:28.110 --> 31:30.350]  now you got a screen test.
[31:30.350 --> 31:31.710]  Now you got a DNA.
[31:31.710 --> 31:33.110]  You got history.
[31:33.110 --> 31:34.670]  You got everything.
[31:34.670 --> 31:38.450]  And so now you know who you got in the country.
[31:39.750 --> 31:42.710]  And then when you come across the badasses too,
[31:42.710 --> 31:43.710]  that works too.
[31:44.910 --> 31:46.310]  Because you need Paul.
[31:47.190 --> 31:48.310]  I want the smuggler.
[31:48.310 --> 31:51.950]  I want the guy, the guy that people pay a lot of money
[31:51.950 --> 31:53.550]  to sneak into.
[31:53.550 --> 31:55.590]  Because they're clever as can be.
[31:55.590 --> 31:59.650]  In fact, I was in jail with one of the smugglers.
[32:01.150 --> 32:03.510]  You know how we smuggled the immigrants in?
[32:03.510 --> 32:05.870]  At five, we put them in the pot.
[32:05.870 --> 32:07.110]  Wow, how?
[32:07.110 --> 32:08.390]  On his motorcycle.
[32:10.090 --> 32:12.230]  Put a motorcycle gear on him.
[32:12.230 --> 32:13.070]  Yeah?
[32:14.590 --> 32:16.310]  Zips through everywhere.
[32:16.310 --> 32:17.790]  Zips through anywhere.
[32:17.790 --> 32:20.270]  Oh yeah, motorcycles don't get caught.
[32:20.270 --> 32:21.110]  Anywhere.
[32:21.630 --> 32:22.470]  Wow.
[32:22.470 --> 32:24.310]  And there's no reason to stop.
[32:25.390 --> 32:26.230]  Right.
[32:26.230 --> 32:28.150]  They're on a motorcycle.
[32:28.150 --> 32:31.710]  And then you take them to wherever they had to go.
[32:31.710 --> 32:32.790]  You get paid.
[32:32.790 --> 32:34.950]  You go back and get another load.
[32:34.950 --> 32:37.190]  And so that's going on now.
[32:37.190 --> 32:38.030]  Yeah.
[32:38.030 --> 32:39.630]  So I wanna show that.
[32:39.630 --> 32:41.230]  I wanna show that.
[32:41.230 --> 32:43.470]  It's just like the war on pot.
[32:45.150 --> 32:47.750]  They had this cockamamie,
[32:47.750 --> 32:50.190]  the judge is thinking that marijuana
[32:50.190 --> 32:54.950]  made those rioters in Michigan.
[32:54.950 --> 32:55.790]  Oh gosh.
[32:55.790 --> 32:56.630]  What?
[32:56.630 --> 32:57.470]  What?
[32:57.470 --> 32:58.910]  Wanna kill the governor.
[32:58.910 --> 33:01.470]  It was because of marijuana use.
[33:01.470 --> 33:02.630]  Oh, 100%.
[33:02.630 --> 33:04.190]  100%, yes.
[33:04.190 --> 33:05.950]  Don't have to convince me.
[33:05.950 --> 33:07.670]  Yeah, but you see,
[33:10.430 --> 33:12.470]  the power of a movie company.
[33:12.470 --> 33:15.430]  And I wanna be the mogul, by the way.
[33:15.430 --> 33:16.510]  Because. Nice.
[33:17.270 --> 33:19.510]  The trouble, it's not a trouble.
[33:20.990 --> 33:25.990]  Like, I got no complaint against our electoral system at all
[33:26.510 --> 33:30.270]  because it really proved so strong.
[33:30.270 --> 33:32.990]  The Constitution, the American way of life
[33:32.990 --> 33:34.870]  was so powerful.
[33:34.870 --> 33:38.470]  No punk like Rudy Giuliani or any of those guys
[33:38.470 --> 33:39.830]  gonna mess with that.
[33:43.030 --> 33:45.550]  I mean, if you don't have military behind you
[33:45.590 --> 33:46.750]  when you do anything,
[33:47.750 --> 33:49.310]  you're not gonna go anywhere.
[33:49.310 --> 33:50.310]  No.
[33:50.310 --> 33:52.030]  Nowhere except to jail.
[33:54.550 --> 33:56.830]  Boy, I had the best time.
[33:56.830 --> 33:58.030]  I had to shut up, though.
[33:58.030 --> 34:01.070]  In fact, my son took me off Twitter.
[34:01.070 --> 34:01.910]  Oh no.
[34:03.790 --> 34:04.670]  It's weird, man.
[34:04.670 --> 34:06.470]  You gotta be careful these days.
[34:06.470 --> 34:11.070]  But being careful is not sometimes in the vocabulary
[34:11.070 --> 34:12.550]  of a passionate person.
[34:12.590 --> 34:15.910]  And I think what you're doing is fabulous.
[34:15.910 --> 34:18.310]  One is creating opportunity.
[34:18.310 --> 34:19.830]  Two, solving a problem.
[34:19.830 --> 34:22.030]  And then three, investing in people.
[34:22.030 --> 34:23.790]  When you invest in people,
[34:23.790 --> 34:26.990]  the Rain Corporation, that was the audio company
[34:26.990 --> 34:28.710]  that I worked for for many years.
[34:28.710 --> 34:31.630]  And I only mentioned their name because they got it.
[34:31.630 --> 34:34.270]  They invested in their people.
[34:34.270 --> 34:38.030]  And it was a phenomenal company.
[34:38.030 --> 34:40.590]  And it's short-sighted, I think,
[34:40.830 --> 34:42.110]  of a lot of companies today
[34:42.110 --> 34:43.510]  that don't invest in their people.
[34:43.510 --> 34:46.350]  Because you'd be amazed at how happy people will be,
[34:46.350 --> 34:48.550]  how much more production there is,
[34:48.550 --> 34:52.070]  and just better quality when people are happy.
[34:52.070 --> 34:55.390]  It's truth seekers.
[34:56.710 --> 35:01.030]  They're a very small minority.
[35:01.030 --> 35:02.270]  Very small.
[35:02.270 --> 35:04.870]  Because it's so easy to lie.
[35:04.870 --> 35:07.310]  And lying is a habit.
[35:07.310 --> 35:10.510]  And if you fool these people enough times,
[35:11.390 --> 35:13.590]  you think that's all there is on the planet
[35:13.590 --> 35:15.150]  is those people.
[35:15.150 --> 35:16.310]  Well, they're not.
[35:16.310 --> 35:18.510]  And they're in a minority.
[35:19.590 --> 35:22.630]  And if Trump, for instance,
[35:23.550 --> 35:25.350]  I had hope for him.
[35:25.350 --> 35:28.390]  Because I thought, okay, look at the bright side.
[35:28.390 --> 35:30.510]  I always look at the bright side of everything.
[35:30.510 --> 35:34.830]  And so when Trump looked like he might win,
[35:34.830 --> 35:36.430]  I started thinking of the positives.
[35:36.430 --> 35:38.710]  Okay, I says, well, he's a builder.
[35:38.710 --> 35:40.910]  And the first thing a builder ever does
[35:40.910 --> 35:43.350]  is to tear down the old building,
[35:43.350 --> 35:45.470]  wherever he has to tear it down.
[35:45.470 --> 35:47.070]  Builders don't wanna fix anything.
[35:47.070 --> 35:49.430]  Builders wanna start from scratch.
[35:49.430 --> 35:50.990]  So the first thing as a builder,
[35:50.990 --> 35:52.230]  you gotta tear down a ship.
[35:52.230 --> 35:54.110]  Because the reason you gotta tear it down
[35:54.110 --> 35:56.270]  is it's on the best property.
[35:56.270 --> 35:57.990]  Because if it wasn't there,
[35:57.990 --> 35:59.910]  then that's not the best property.
[35:59.910 --> 36:02.310]  So the property that's on is valuable.
[36:02.310 --> 36:06.070]  So I thought his ability to tear down buildings,
[36:06.070 --> 36:07.790]  which is pretty extensive.
[36:07.790 --> 36:09.270]  He's torn down a lot.
[36:10.190 --> 36:11.910]  If, just think of this,
[36:11.910 --> 36:14.790]  if Trump just focused on the infrastructure,
[36:15.750 --> 36:17.510]  the infrastructure,
[36:17.510 --> 36:19.430]  he would be going down
[36:19.430 --> 36:22.630]  as the greatest president of all times.
[36:22.630 --> 36:24.830]  That's investing in the people.
[36:24.830 --> 36:26.310]  That's how close he came.
[36:26.310 --> 36:30.310]  Because number one, he knows that industry.
[36:30.310 --> 36:31.550]  You don't do it yourself.
[36:31.550 --> 36:32.910]  You hire the best.
[36:32.910 --> 36:36.470]  And so you hire the best infrastructure people.
[36:36.470 --> 36:39.710]  And you sit back and just take phone calls
[36:39.710 --> 36:44.470]  appearing and breaking ground and cutting ribbons
[36:44.470 --> 36:48.470]  and being congratulated by everybody who you help.
[36:48.470 --> 36:50.870]  Because that's what infrastructure does.
[36:50.870 --> 36:53.150]  It's like bodybuilding.
[36:53.150 --> 36:58.150]  Now you're recreating this beautiful country physically.
[36:58.510 --> 37:03.510]  And the water's hip and the electrical stuff is the best.
[37:03.510 --> 37:06.070]  Everything, the internet, everything.
[37:06.670 --> 37:07.510]  And when you got all that,
[37:07.510 --> 37:09.510]  you got a superpower country
[37:09.510 --> 37:12.510]  that really lives up to its name.
[37:12.510 --> 37:14.950]  Not about what weapons you have.
[37:14.950 --> 37:19.950]  It's how many solar clean living entities
[37:21.430 --> 37:23.510]  you have running the country.
[37:24.390 --> 37:28.270]  And that's how close Trump came to being the best,
[37:28.270 --> 37:29.430]  the best of the best,
[37:29.430 --> 37:31.790]  without knowing shit.
[37:31.790 --> 37:33.350]  Without trying, accidentally.
[37:33.350 --> 37:34.190]  Without knowing nothing.
[37:34.190 --> 37:35.710]  All he had to do is tell,
[37:36.350 --> 37:39.270]  okay, you take care of all the spy shit.
[37:39.270 --> 37:40.550]  Fix the roads, yeah.
[37:40.550 --> 37:43.230]  Yeah, and I'll just take a little bit
[37:43.230 --> 37:47.510]  from every constructor, contractor coming in
[37:47.510 --> 37:50.430]  to pay, just to work on the thing.
[37:50.430 --> 37:51.750]  How rich would he be?
[37:51.750 --> 37:53.630]  Even just shave off half a cent.
[37:53.630 --> 37:55.030]  Just shave off half a cent.
[37:55.030 --> 37:55.870]  Yes.
[37:55.870 --> 37:57.390]  You're still rich.
[37:57.390 --> 37:58.470]  Yes.
[37:58.470 --> 38:01.030]  And, but be loved.
[38:01.030 --> 38:02.510]  Be loved.
[38:02.510 --> 38:03.470]  You see?
[38:03.470 --> 38:06.350]  Now, is Biden gonna do it?
[38:07.430 --> 38:09.390]  Eh, could be.
[38:09.390 --> 38:10.630]  He's doing a lot.
[38:10.630 --> 38:12.430]  He's, with what he's got, you know.
[38:12.430 --> 38:15.270]  The Trumpians are throwing everything his way.
[38:15.270 --> 38:16.790]  I mean, I love the way,
[38:16.790 --> 38:18.590]  you talk about truth, man.
[38:18.590 --> 38:22.950]  I can't, I hardly go on my mails
[38:22.950 --> 38:26.590]  because every Democrat famous,
[38:26.590 --> 38:29.190]  or not famous, is begging for money.
[38:29.190 --> 38:30.030]  Right.
[38:30.030 --> 38:30.870]  Begging for money.
[38:30.870 --> 38:32.910]  Just, oh, we're closed for a minute, you know.
[38:33.270 --> 38:34.870]  Like Biden's behind in the polls.
[38:37.070 --> 38:40.310]  And what kills me is the manipulation is so obvious,
[38:40.310 --> 38:45.310]  you know, because my partner that I was with today,
[38:45.710 --> 38:48.030]  he said, you know, if Trump gets in,
[38:48.030 --> 38:49.630]  I said, gets in what?
[38:49.630 --> 38:50.710]  If he gets reelected?
[38:50.710 --> 38:52.150]  I said.
[38:52.150 --> 38:52.990]  Gets in trouble.
[38:52.990 --> 38:54.430]  No, you can't, no.
[38:54.430 --> 38:56.550]  He's an ex-banker.
[38:56.550 --> 38:58.190]  I said, no.
[38:58.190 --> 39:00.550]  Are you seriously thinking?
[39:00.550 --> 39:02.790]  But that's the way straight people think.
[39:03.710 --> 39:04.550]  You know, they do.
[39:04.550 --> 39:07.310]  He's very straight and they forget.
[39:08.270 --> 39:11.190]  They forget all the shit that Trump's done.
[39:11.190 --> 39:12.430]  And it's irreplaceable.
[39:12.430 --> 39:14.310]  You can't put it back in the bottle.
[39:14.310 --> 39:15.710]  No, no.
[39:15.710 --> 39:17.590]  We tend to, especially politically,
[39:17.590 --> 39:19.790]  have a really short-term memory.
[39:19.790 --> 39:21.630]  It's almost as fast as the news cycle.
[39:21.630 --> 39:24.070]  So people do forget.
[39:24.070 --> 39:25.590]  Like you were saying, though,
[39:25.590 --> 39:26.750]  some of the fundraising,
[39:26.750 --> 39:28.150]  and just even some of the rhetoric.
[39:28.150 --> 39:29.910]  I try to listen to everybody.
[39:29.910 --> 39:32.190]  Some of it is just so damn obvious.
[39:32.550 --> 39:35.710]  They gave up trying to con you 10 years ago.
[39:35.710 --> 39:38.710]  They're just like, boilerplate, here you go.
[39:38.710 --> 39:40.990]  Come on, funnel into this little corral.
[39:40.990 --> 39:41.830]  There you go.
[39:41.830 --> 39:43.030]  Yeah, yeah.
[39:43.030 --> 39:45.830]  Because it's the same old song.
[39:46.830 --> 39:49.310]  Money talks, bullshit walks.
[39:49.310 --> 39:53.590]  And that's why the weapons thing is so crazy.
[39:53.590 --> 39:56.110]  Because the gun manufacturers,
[39:56.110 --> 39:58.310]  they're making a shitload of money.
[39:58.310 --> 40:01.430]  But they're the dark side.
[40:02.550 --> 40:04.710]  And you have to have a dark side.
[40:04.710 --> 40:05.750]  If you don't have a dark side,
[40:05.750 --> 40:07.830]  you don't have a light side.
[40:07.830 --> 40:09.430]  So that's the darkest side.
[40:10.390 --> 40:13.470]  But you're not gonna win any elections with it.
[40:13.470 --> 40:14.310]  No.
[40:16.190 --> 40:18.510]  With what, everything's gone down now.
[40:19.390 --> 40:22.110]  I mean, we think about it,
[40:22.110 --> 40:23.790]  the pandemic took Trump out.
[40:25.190 --> 40:26.350]  It took him out.
[40:26.350 --> 40:27.590]  Yeah.
[40:28.150 --> 40:30.550]  All of a sudden, his lies don't mean shit.
[40:31.470 --> 40:32.510]  No, people-
[40:32.510 --> 40:33.870]  When are we gonna get the vaccine?
[40:33.870 --> 40:35.830]  That's all that anybody worried about.
[40:36.710 --> 40:37.670]  Or the mask.
[40:37.670 --> 40:40.270]  We were the shortage of masks.
[40:40.270 --> 40:41.270]  You know, what were we doing?
[40:41.270 --> 40:42.470]  We were washing our hands.
[40:42.470 --> 40:45.190]  Just, oh my God, maybe that'll help.
[40:47.550 --> 40:48.390]  Yeah.
[40:48.390 --> 40:52.470]  Yeah, that's one of those unmasked truths
[40:52.470 --> 40:55.430]  that we kind of got, just about supply chains
[40:55.430 --> 40:56.870]  and about what we actually make.
[40:57.830 --> 40:59.110]  Not being prepared.
[40:59.110 --> 41:00.870]  I think that would have been a challenge
[41:00.870 --> 41:03.510]  for any sitting president to deal
[41:03.510 --> 41:05.350]  because we've never faced anything like that.
[41:05.350 --> 41:07.030]  But certainly-
[41:07.030 --> 41:08.950]  That's what Trump took on the part.
[41:10.350 --> 41:13.670]  First of all, there is no, well, just use Lysol.
[41:15.070 --> 41:15.910]  Kshhh.
[41:17.910 --> 41:18.750]  Lysol.
[41:19.870 --> 41:21.270]  Oh my God.
[41:21.270 --> 41:22.110]  Oh my God.
[41:22.990 --> 41:23.830]  Oh my God.
[41:23.830 --> 41:25.750]  I love that guy.
[41:25.750 --> 41:26.590]  Yeah.
[41:27.310 --> 41:31.350]  I've written a lot of poems and shit about him.
[41:31.350 --> 41:34.310]  But like I said, my son took me on Twitter.
[41:35.270 --> 41:36.910]  I was gonna say, as a comedian,
[41:36.910 --> 41:39.350]  I'm sure it's just like daily fodder.
[41:39.350 --> 41:40.190]  You love it.
[41:40.190 --> 41:41.910]  You're just like, what's happening today?
[41:41.910 --> 41:43.310]  Oh, you know it.
[41:43.310 --> 41:44.150]  You know it.
[41:44.150 --> 41:46.590]  Well, there's the late night shows.
[41:47.510 --> 41:49.710]  Yeah, the South African kid.
[41:50.750 --> 41:52.070]  Yeah, Trevor Noah.
[41:52.070 --> 41:52.910]  Yeah, Trevor.
[41:52.910 --> 41:55.190]  Oh man, he's incredible.
[41:55.190 --> 41:56.030]  All of them.
[41:57.750 --> 42:01.830]  Oh, Joe Coy, you know, the Filipino comedian?
[42:01.830 --> 42:03.270]  I'm not.
[42:03.270 --> 42:04.310]  I'm not.
[42:04.310 --> 42:05.750]  I don't think so.
[42:05.750 --> 42:08.230]  I probably have, but not ringing the bell right now.
[42:08.230 --> 42:12.230]  Well, I went to his premiere of his movie, Easter.
[42:12.230 --> 42:13.070]  It's worth seeing.
[42:13.070 --> 42:15.670]  It is definitely worth seeing, you know.
[42:15.670 --> 42:19.230]  And it was fun watching him on the late night show
[42:19.230 --> 42:24.230]  with Jimmy Kimball and the other guy.
[42:25.630 --> 42:26.750]  Jimmy Fallon?
[42:26.750 --> 42:27.590]  Yeah, Fallon.
[42:27.590 --> 42:28.430]  Okay.
[42:28.430 --> 42:30.990]  I don't know why I can't remember Fallon's name.
[42:30.990 --> 42:33.150]  We were on, Teach and I were on his show one time,
[42:33.150 --> 42:33.990]  you know.
[42:35.590 --> 42:36.710]  Yeah, it was great.
[42:36.710 --> 42:38.230]  We had a lot of fun.
[42:38.230 --> 42:39.310]  Love New York.
[42:39.310 --> 42:40.430]  Awesome.
[42:40.430 --> 42:41.270]  Awesome.
[42:41.270 --> 42:44.630]  Well, real quick, I know we're kind of coming up
[42:44.630 --> 42:46.510]  to the end and there were,
[42:46.510 --> 42:48.630]  I'm sure we could go indefinitely,
[42:48.630 --> 42:50.390]  have many fascinating conversations,
[42:50.390 --> 42:52.590]  but I'm definitely gonna respect your time here.
[42:52.590 --> 42:53.950]  There were just a couple of things
[42:53.950 --> 42:57.110]  that was really important for me to bring up.
[42:57.110 --> 42:57.950]  Sure.
[42:57.950 --> 43:00.710]  Again, we were talking about the movies earlier
[43:00.710 --> 43:04.270]  and you know, this, okay.
[43:04.270 --> 43:08.390]  So a lot of people may know you from some of the movies
[43:08.390 --> 43:09.350]  and that's your character.
[43:09.350 --> 43:12.950]  And there's people who can walk into a cannabis dispensary
[43:12.950 --> 43:15.990]  now that may not have known
[43:15.990 --> 43:18.870]  that you are actually a prisoner of cannabis.
[43:18.870 --> 43:23.230]  This was almost 20 years ago now, in 2003,
[43:23.550 --> 43:25.230]  you went to prison for cannabis.
[43:25.230 --> 43:28.790]  And that I think is something that should not be forgotten
[43:28.790 --> 43:32.670]  or should ever be forgotten or just not even talked about
[43:32.670 --> 43:36.350]  because you served one of the ultimate prices
[43:36.350 --> 43:40.030]  for something that a lot of people take for granted today.
[43:40.030 --> 43:43.750]  So can you maybe just speak a little bit about that
[43:43.750 --> 43:47.390]  or maybe fill in people briefly who aren't familiar with it?
[43:47.390 --> 43:49.430]  Because again, I think it's so important
[43:49.430 --> 43:52.070]  to honor you as that as well.
[43:52.830 --> 43:55.310]  We were shooting a documentary at the time
[43:56.470 --> 43:59.230]  and it was like serendipity again,
[43:59.230 --> 44:04.230]  you know, like, okay, we need a really good middle here.
[44:04.390 --> 44:07.470]  The next thing you know,
[44:07.470 --> 44:11.950]  because I never had the feeling
[44:11.950 --> 44:13.870]  that they were out to get me.
[44:15.070 --> 44:17.630]  I never had that feeling at all
[44:17.630 --> 44:20.310]  because I'm loved everywhere I go.
[44:20.990 --> 44:23.110]  I never had an enemy.
[44:23.110 --> 44:26.110]  I never confronted an enemy ever.
[44:27.750 --> 44:32.350]  And so when they were trying to bust me on tape,
[44:32.350 --> 44:37.030]  you know, undercover cops come in Arlington, Texas
[44:37.030 --> 44:39.630]  and it was like a bad movie, you know.
[44:40.710 --> 44:43.590]  They were wearing T-shirts and headbands.
[44:43.590 --> 44:44.990]  Oh, wow.
[44:44.990 --> 44:47.110]  You don't know wearing headbands
[44:47.950 --> 44:52.430]  and knapsacks with a camera in the knapsack.
[44:52.430 --> 44:54.670]  And so they took me outside and talked to me
[44:54.670 --> 44:56.750]  and asked me about these bongs,
[44:56.750 --> 44:59.510]  they're not just for smoking tobacco, are they?
[44:59.510 --> 45:01.150]  No, hell no.
[45:01.150 --> 45:02.710]  For pot, you know, marijuana.
[45:02.710 --> 45:06.470]  So I did everything they were looking for it to do.
[45:06.470 --> 45:09.590]  And then, and the owners of the store, you know,
[45:09.590 --> 45:14.590]  they had DEA T-shirts standing next to all the DEA guys.
[45:14.990 --> 45:15.830]  Oh, no.
[45:17.430 --> 45:18.910]  Irony is thick there.
[45:18.910 --> 45:23.910]  Yeah, but so I never took it serious, you know.
[45:24.990 --> 45:27.310]  And then come time, you know,
[45:27.310 --> 45:30.270]  then it came time to close it.
[45:30.270 --> 45:32.350]  Oh, I'm going to court.
[45:32.350 --> 45:33.190]  Yeah.
[45:33.190 --> 45:35.990]  I got to go before a judge, oh shit.
[45:35.990 --> 45:39.310]  So then that night I wrote a whole thing,
[45:39.310 --> 45:40.910]  almost like a confession, you know,
[45:40.910 --> 45:42.710]  and I showed it to my lawyer.
[45:42.710 --> 45:46.670]  My lawyer says, no, no, that ain't gonna help.
[45:47.270 --> 45:50.590]  And so then I addressed the judge,
[45:50.590 --> 45:53.510]  he wanted to hear what I had to say before he sentenced me.
[45:53.510 --> 45:58.510]  And I told him, I said, you know, judge, you know,
[45:58.910 --> 46:02.390]  I'm involved, you know, because of the trial,
[46:02.390 --> 46:05.110]  I'm involved with teaching kids
[46:05.110 --> 46:09.190]  at Chapman University in Orange County.
[46:09.190 --> 46:13.310]  I says, and what I'm teaching them is how to dance salsa,
[46:13.350 --> 46:18.070]  because salsa is such a beautiful cultural dance
[46:18.070 --> 46:22.630]  that is being lost, you know, and it would be nice,
[46:22.630 --> 46:26.430]  you know, so I think that I could do more good
[46:26.430 --> 46:29.070]  on the outside teaching these kids
[46:29.070 --> 46:33.150]  than I would be, you know, in prison.
[46:33.150 --> 46:34.950]  And the judge said, is that it?
[46:35.870 --> 46:36.710]  Oh, shit.
[46:38.150 --> 46:38.990]  Damn.
[46:39.150 --> 46:43.110]  I said, yeah, okay, nine months, boom.
[46:44.230 --> 46:49.230]  And, but, you know, it was,
[46:51.390 --> 46:54.550]  soon as I knew I was going to jail, then I was fine.
[46:54.550 --> 46:56.630]  Then it was exciting.
[46:56.630 --> 47:00.590]  Now I was like, hey, you know, I'm going on an acting gig.
[47:00.590 --> 47:03.710]  I'm gonna be gone for nine months, shooting a movie,
[47:03.710 --> 47:04.590]  because that's what we did.
[47:04.590 --> 47:07.310]  We shot the documentary the whole time.
[47:07.310 --> 47:09.710]  And it's out now, you know, you can get it.
[47:09.710 --> 47:13.910]  It's AKA Tommy Chong, and it's all about my prison state,
[47:13.910 --> 47:16.710]  you know, while I was there and what I did.
[47:16.710 --> 47:20.310]  I, it was one of the nicest times of my life.
[47:20.310 --> 47:23.870]  It was, I turned it into a spiritual retreat.
[47:23.870 --> 47:28.350]  I had the I Ching with me, the Book of Changes.
[47:28.350 --> 47:32.790]  I had my Goldsmiths book.
[47:33.670 --> 47:38.670]  I just really played in the garden the whole time.
[47:40.510 --> 47:45.510]  Not played, I made ceramics out of clay,
[47:45.910 --> 47:49.230]  and I made little Japanese gardens out of the rocks.
[47:49.230 --> 47:50.070]  Nice.
[47:50.070 --> 47:54.030]  And I just really, every day was so special.
[47:54.030 --> 47:58.070]  And I read a lot of books that I would never normally read.
[47:58.070 --> 48:00.430]  Well, Salt was one of the books.
[48:01.270 --> 48:03.950]  I learned how to play bocce ball.
[48:03.950 --> 48:07.950]  I looked at so much fun, so addicting.
[48:07.950 --> 48:10.310]  But I found that only in prison, you know.
[48:10.310 --> 48:11.150]  Right.
[48:11.150 --> 48:15.270]  It's hard to get a bocce ball game out of prison.
[48:15.270 --> 48:18.910]  But I really, and then I made a lot of friends
[48:18.910 --> 48:21.390]  that, you know, lifetime, you know.
[48:21.390 --> 48:25.670]  I was in there with a caddy who was also bum-wrapped
[48:25.670 --> 48:28.470]  in there, Eric Larson.
[48:28.470 --> 48:33.470]  And he got some ridiculous sentence
[48:33.990 --> 48:36.750]  because he wouldn't rat on anybody,
[48:36.750 --> 48:40.830]  and someone ratted on him to save their life.
[48:40.830 --> 48:41.670]  Right.
[48:41.670 --> 48:44.550]  And so he ended up doing 14 years,
[48:44.550 --> 48:47.230]  and then he finally got, he did 10.
[48:47.230 --> 48:50.150]  For something, but he was a user, that's all.
[48:50.150 --> 48:52.470]  And they tried to make him like a kingpin.
[48:52.470 --> 48:54.350]  So, but so we're friends.
[48:54.350 --> 48:55.990]  He got me into playing golf,
[48:56.030 --> 48:58.910]  got me some free clubs from Cleveland.
[48:58.910 --> 49:03.750]  And yeah, so everything's, my life has just blossomed.
[49:03.750 --> 49:04.590]  So beautiful.
[49:05.710 --> 49:08.510]  Well, that's definitely a situation.
[49:08.510 --> 49:09.790]  It is what you make it.
[49:09.790 --> 49:12.270]  And going back to the truth and seeking the truth,
[49:12.270 --> 49:14.350]  it sounds like you were seeking truth while you were there.
[49:14.350 --> 49:17.110]  And that is a positive experience.
[49:17.950 --> 49:18.790]  Yeah.
[49:18.790 --> 49:19.950]  Yeah, I've changed lives.
[49:19.950 --> 49:21.430]  I know that, you know.
[49:21.430 --> 49:23.150]  In fact, even Eric.
[49:23.270 --> 49:26.190]  Eric was kind of down and out, you know.
[49:26.190 --> 49:29.190]  And then I, my best friend in the joint
[49:29.190 --> 49:32.950]  was the drug counselor who was also an audio engineer.
[49:32.950 --> 49:36.550]  He was an old roadie, and he was the drug counselor.
[49:36.550 --> 49:39.310]  And we'd hang out at his office all the time.
[49:39.310 --> 49:41.670]  Even to the point, one time the warden,
[49:41.670 --> 49:43.510]  the assistant warden bust in
[49:43.510 --> 49:46.190]  and tried to catch us doing something.
[49:46.190 --> 49:47.390]  We weren't doing shit.
[49:47.390 --> 49:50.870]  It was just sitting around drinking coffee.
[49:50.870 --> 49:51.710]  Right, right.
[49:52.270 --> 49:53.270]  Yeah, yeah.
[49:53.270 --> 49:57.590]  No, and so Griff put him on the drug program
[49:57.590 --> 49:59.910]  and got him out within a year.
[49:59.910 --> 50:02.790]  You know, he had all this time knocked off his sentence
[50:02.790 --> 50:04.710]  because he did the drug program.
[50:04.710 --> 50:06.830]  And, you know, in those prisons,
[50:06.830 --> 50:09.790]  they're trying to get people out of there anyway,
[50:09.790 --> 50:12.230]  because it's so crowded, you know.
[50:12.230 --> 50:15.430]  And so there's always new people waiting to get in.
[50:15.430 --> 50:20.230]  Because it really is the only federal education system
[50:20.270 --> 50:24.590]  that we really have in America is in the federal pen.
[50:24.590 --> 50:26.910]  Because when you go federal crimes,
[50:26.910 --> 50:30.990]  it's mandated that if you don't have a high school education
[50:30.990 --> 50:35.310]  you have to get a GED or study for one while you're there.
[50:35.310 --> 50:37.190]  I studied for one, but I failed.
[50:38.390 --> 50:40.030]  I couldn't pass algebra.
[50:41.670 --> 50:43.830]  I'll tell you, that's my Achilles heel too.
[50:43.830 --> 50:46.630]  I was good at math until they started using letters.
[50:46.630 --> 50:48.510]  Come on.
[50:48.550 --> 50:49.790]  I know, I know.
[50:51.950 --> 50:53.510]  Oh, shoot.
[50:53.510 --> 50:56.110]  Well, yeah, again, I'm glad that you made
[50:56.110 --> 50:57.830]  the most of that there.
[50:59.030 --> 51:01.230]  And that you made some good, you know,
[51:01.230 --> 51:03.230]  connections and friends as well.
[51:03.230 --> 51:04.070]  That's important.
[51:04.070 --> 51:06.070]  And I imagine that helped too.
[51:06.070 --> 51:10.110]  Yeah, well, like I say, you know, you can't go back.
[51:10.950 --> 51:13.750]  You know, this way the world is,
[51:13.750 --> 51:16.230]  we're whipping through space
[51:16.230 --> 51:20.430]  at an enormous amount and you can never go back.
[51:21.550 --> 51:23.750]  And that's good.
[51:23.750 --> 51:24.590]  That's good.
[51:24.590 --> 51:27.190]  Now you can recreate, you know,
[51:27.190 --> 51:28.870]  and that's what you wanna do
[51:28.870 --> 51:31.470]  when you get something that works.
[51:31.470 --> 51:34.710]  You know, like a band, you know, gets a hit tune,
[51:34.710 --> 51:36.510]  better not get sick of doing it
[51:37.390 --> 51:39.550]  because that's gonna be what you're doing
[51:39.550 --> 51:43.190]  the rest of your life, you know?
[51:43.230 --> 51:47.790]  Yeah, MC Hammer, I'll stop there.
[51:50.950 --> 51:54.190]  Oh, real quick.
[51:54.190 --> 51:55.150]  Let's see here.
[51:55.150 --> 51:55.990]  I wanna try.
[52:00.030 --> 52:02.670]  Oh, I've managed to keep this a surprise
[52:02.670 --> 52:05.750]  from somebody for a few weeks.
[52:05.750 --> 52:07.990]  And I'm just, okay, let's see.
[52:07.990 --> 52:09.870]  Can I have some water, please?
[52:09.870 --> 52:12.150]  Or you can come here for a second.
[52:12.190 --> 52:15.670]  I just wanna have somebody say hello to you if possible.
[52:15.670 --> 52:16.510]  Sure.
[52:16.510 --> 52:19.310]  This is my wife, Genevieve.
[52:19.310 --> 52:20.150]  She wants to say-
[52:20.150 --> 52:22.070]  Genevieve, I love the name.
[52:22.070 --> 52:23.830]  Are you from England?
[52:23.830 --> 52:24.670]  Oh, I wish.
[52:24.670 --> 52:26.630]  Sometimes I am.
[52:26.630 --> 52:28.350]  Sometimes I'm from other places.
[52:29.670 --> 52:31.790]  She loves doing accents.
[52:31.790 --> 52:33.710]  Where are you from originally?
[52:33.710 --> 52:34.550]  Oh, really?
[52:34.550 --> 52:35.950]  Originally, Wisconsin.
[52:36.950 --> 52:39.910]  From the 70s show, actually, from WASA, was it?
[52:39.910 --> 52:41.270]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[52:41.390 --> 52:44.830]  Are you an actress?
[52:44.830 --> 52:47.350]  Some days, at home.
[52:47.350 --> 52:49.110]  Not out in public, though.
[52:50.830 --> 52:51.670]  Well, that's nice.
[52:51.670 --> 52:52.510]  That's fun.
[52:52.510 --> 52:53.350]  It's very nice to meet you.
[52:53.350 --> 52:56.190]  I wanted to thank you for the bright light you shine
[52:56.190 --> 52:58.750]  in this world, and thanks for sharing your gifts with us.
[52:58.750 --> 53:01.550]  And peace, pot, and micro dot, sir.
[53:02.470 --> 53:04.390]  My pleasure, my pleasure.
[53:04.390 --> 53:05.310]  That's awesome.
[53:06.550 --> 53:07.390]  Thank you.
[53:07.390 --> 53:08.910]  Hope you have a magical day.
[53:08.910 --> 53:09.950]  Thank you, dear.
[53:09.950 --> 53:10.790]  Nice seeing you.
[53:11.310 --> 53:12.150]  You're welcome.
[53:12.150 --> 53:14.750]  Okay, yay, I'm gonna get extra kisses.
[53:14.750 --> 53:16.270]  I managed to get that as a prize.
[53:16.270 --> 53:20.350]  You're a huge, she's a huge fan,
[53:20.350 --> 53:23.390]  so I'm proud that she did throw her bra on stage
[53:23.390 --> 53:24.230]  or something. Beautiful, beautiful.
[53:24.230 --> 53:25.110]  I love her hair.
[53:25.110 --> 53:25.950]  Thank you.
[53:25.950 --> 53:29.550]  Pinky, you know, we've known each other for about 20 years,
[53:29.550 --> 53:32.550]  and my original name for her was Pinky Guns,
[53:32.550 --> 53:34.590]  because she's kind of a smaller girl,
[53:34.590 --> 53:36.270]  and she tried flexing one night.
[53:36.270 --> 53:38.870]  I'm like, Pinky Guns, okay, so that's her name.
[53:39.270 --> 53:41.790]  And that's stuck ever since.
[53:41.790 --> 53:44.230]  But, oh, that was, again,
[53:44.230 --> 53:46.670]  you're creating lifelong memories today,
[53:46.670 --> 53:48.830]  so I do appreciate your time,
[53:48.830 --> 53:51.190]  and I thank you so much for that.
[53:51.190 --> 53:54.510]  And I do wanna just, you know, a couple minutes left here.
[53:54.510 --> 53:57.750]  I wanted to touch on one of the other important aspects
[53:57.750 --> 54:00.710]  to me again, is, you know, I want people to remember,
[54:00.710 --> 54:03.430]  you know, the sacrifices that you've made
[54:03.430 --> 54:05.190]  for this plant that we all love.
[54:06.110 --> 54:09.510]  Another topic, though, that is very near and dear to me
[54:09.510 --> 54:11.990]  is cannabis as a medicine.
[54:11.990 --> 54:16.450]  I use cannabis as a medicine and have for many years.
[54:16.450 --> 54:19.350]  You've had your own experience with cannabis as medicine.
[54:19.350 --> 54:22.270]  Can you maybe tell people a little bit about the experience
[54:22.270 --> 54:23.910]  and also what you're doing now
[54:23.910 --> 54:28.470]  for people seeking these types of remedies?
[54:28.470 --> 54:31.350]  Well, again, truth.
[54:31.350 --> 54:35.110]  If you think you have something,
[54:35.110 --> 54:38.710]  and you know, you find out that you do or you don't,
[54:40.830 --> 54:44.150]  I found out, you know, when I was in prison
[54:44.150 --> 54:48.030]  that I contracted prostate cancer.
[54:48.950 --> 54:52.430]  And at first, they give you that old,
[54:52.430 --> 54:54.670]  oh, don't worry, it's a slow-moving cancer.
[54:54.670 --> 54:56.190]  You'll probably die of something else
[54:56.190 --> 54:59.470]  before you die of that bullshit.
[54:59.510 --> 55:03.710]  And it's still cancer, no matter how you have it.
[55:03.710 --> 55:08.710]  And so, anyway, I ended up getting biopsied
[55:08.750 --> 55:13.430]  and all that stuff, and then I turned into rectal cancer.
[55:14.790 --> 55:17.270]  Now, it's a little serious, you know,
[55:17.270 --> 55:22.270]  because now I got to really get an operation.
[55:23.310 --> 55:25.270]  There's no bullshit around.
[55:25.270 --> 55:29.270]  This is what was gonna kill me before anything else.
[55:30.110 --> 55:33.790]  So I got the best medical advice I could get,
[55:33.790 --> 55:38.190]  and I got the best surgeon on the planet, basically.
[55:38.190 --> 55:42.190]  We did the research, and he took out the tumor,
[55:42.190 --> 55:43.550]  and while they were down there,
[55:43.550 --> 55:46.550]  they radiated everything, including the prostate.
[55:46.550 --> 55:49.110]  So I'm basically cancer-free.
[55:49.110 --> 55:50.390]  Now, where the weed came in
[55:50.390 --> 55:53.550]  was when the healing process took over.
[55:53.550 --> 55:54.670]  When they operate on you,
[55:54.670 --> 55:59.030]  they hook you up to all the exotic drugs that they need to.
[55:59.790 --> 56:03.230]  I was on a very nice drug high for a couple of days
[56:03.230 --> 56:05.390]  while I was in the hospital.
[56:05.390 --> 56:09.590]  But getting off those drugs can be pretty tough.
[56:09.590 --> 56:14.350]  So as soon as I got out, I started doing CBD injections.
[56:15.670 --> 56:18.190]  Even though it's a pretty thick oil,
[56:18.190 --> 56:22.350]  I would suffer to get the injections.
[56:22.350 --> 56:27.350]  I think that really helped calm the system,
[56:27.870 --> 56:30.910]  because what happens for drug addicts,
[56:30.910 --> 56:34.870]  it's the nerve endings that cry out
[56:34.870 --> 56:39.030]  for that same numbness that the drug gave them.
[56:39.910 --> 56:43.710]  And what happens when you got pot, cannabis,
[56:43.710 --> 56:46.310]  it soothes those nerve endings.
[56:46.310 --> 56:50.510]  It takes, like it does your mind, it takes your mind away.
[56:50.510 --> 56:52.670]  It takes you to another spot.
[56:52.670 --> 56:55.830]  And so now you're not, you don't even know what you're doing.
[56:55.950 --> 56:59.030]  You don't even know whether you ate or not.
[56:59.030 --> 57:01.910]  You go, did I eat?
[57:03.030 --> 57:03.950]  Why am I hungry?
[57:03.950 --> 57:05.190]  Oh, I just got high.
[57:06.870 --> 57:11.870]  So when that happens, the healing process takes over.
[57:12.030 --> 57:13.630]  And the healing process right away,
[57:13.630 --> 57:17.110]  if your mind is not interfering,
[57:17.110 --> 57:18.710]  and your mind can interfere,
[57:18.710 --> 57:21.070]  that's where fear comes in probably.
[57:21.070 --> 57:24.390]  Because fear will freeze everything in your body.
[57:24.390 --> 57:27.670]  It stops you, fight or flight it's called.
[57:27.670 --> 57:29.470]  So you get rid of the fear,
[57:29.470 --> 57:32.950]  get rid of the anxieties and the worryness.
[57:32.950 --> 57:35.550]  And worrying is always either living in the past
[57:35.550 --> 57:37.830]  or living in the future.
[57:37.830 --> 57:40.590]  But we put you in the present.
[57:40.590 --> 57:42.590]  It makes you right there trying to figure out
[57:42.590 --> 57:44.270]  where the hell you are.
[57:44.270 --> 57:46.470]  You'll be driving home and next thing you know,
[57:46.470 --> 57:48.630]  you go, oh, fuck, where am I?
[57:48.630 --> 57:50.070]  I don't recognize anything,
[57:50.070 --> 57:52.070]  because you're in the moment.
[57:52.070 --> 57:55.550]  This one moment you looked around that you never used.
[57:55.550 --> 57:57.150]  You just got the blinders.
[57:57.150 --> 57:59.390]  Yeah, so you've got the moment.
[57:59.390 --> 58:03.190]  And just like you can never remember what you were doing,
[58:03.190 --> 58:05.870]  that's what the body needs.
[58:05.870 --> 58:10.150]  Because the body needs to be calm,
[58:10.150 --> 58:11.790]  and so it can heal.
[58:12.990 --> 58:15.310]  And that's what happened to me.
[58:15.310 --> 58:18.670]  So I healed, I healed really, really fast.
[58:18.670 --> 58:21.350]  And it's attitude too.
[58:23.070 --> 58:24.830]  Like depression, for instance.
[58:24.830 --> 58:27.510]  Depression is either worrying about the past
[58:27.510 --> 58:31.230]  or living in the past or living in the future.
[58:32.790 --> 58:34.390]  It's not living in the present.
[58:36.230 --> 58:38.790]  And that's what depression is.
[58:38.790 --> 58:42.590]  And so whatever can move you out of that rut,
[58:42.590 --> 58:46.270]  because like a rut, when a car gets stuck in the mud,
[58:46.270 --> 58:47.510]  you get stuck in a rut.
[58:47.510 --> 58:49.590]  You can't rock it back and forth,
[58:49.590 --> 58:51.590]  and you're not going anywhere.
[58:52.110 --> 58:53.510]  But you gotta get out of that rut.
[58:53.510 --> 58:56.990]  And that's where cannabis will take you smoothly.
[58:56.990 --> 58:58.510]  And all of a sudden when you do the cannabis,
[58:58.510 --> 59:01.310]  there's no rough road.
[59:01.310 --> 59:05.430]  They're just that nice and smooth, gentle ride,
[59:05.430 --> 59:06.790]  all the way to where you're going.
[59:06.790 --> 59:08.350]  And where are you going?
[59:08.350 --> 59:10.430]  Really, that's where sleep comes in.
[59:11.310 --> 59:14.470]  See, sleep, I found, personally,
[59:14.470 --> 59:18.670]  that sleep is the most healing activity
[59:18.710 --> 59:22.590]  you can enjoy every night.
[59:22.590 --> 59:24.270]  Every night.
[59:24.270 --> 59:26.630]  You can enjoy that activity.
[59:26.630 --> 59:31.630]  And so if you're smart, you do the tonics.
[59:33.910 --> 59:36.550]  I don't have my sleep on, but it's similar to this.
[59:36.550 --> 59:38.110]  It's called nice dreams.
[59:39.830 --> 59:42.150]  You've got a little touch of melatonin
[59:42.150 --> 59:45.190]  and into a nice dream state.
[59:45.190 --> 59:46.630]  Not a druggy state.
[59:48.790 --> 59:49.630]  Dream state.
[59:49.630 --> 59:54.030]  And I found out that mixing testosterone
[59:55.670 --> 01:00:00.670]  in the cannabis, you can have a nice sleep,
[01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:03.030]  but you can also have a horny sleep, too.
[01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:06.310]  You're pitching a tent.
[01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:08.190]  You can have those sexy dreams.
[01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:15.830]  So that's how you live.
[01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:21.830]  You treat your body to that as nice as you can.
[01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:24.030]  Treat your body nice.
[01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:26.910]  It's been working for you all its life.
[01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:29.270]  And so it needs comfort.
[01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:30.390]  Needs a massage.
[01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:32.430]  It needs the warm bath.
[01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:37.270]  It needs the, don't be in a rush, ever.
[01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:40.270]  That's when you get hurt, when you get old.
[01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.990]  Because you don't have reflexes anymore.
[01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:45.550]  And there's no reason to move fast.
[01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:48.310]  Just like there's no reason to talk.
[01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:50.870]  A lot of old guys, they get grumpy
[01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:52.910]  because no one listens to them.
[01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:55.670]  Well, they've heard everything you have to say, dude.
[01:00:57.550 --> 01:00:59.910]  We know what you have to say.
[01:00:59.910 --> 01:01:01.190]  And you're gonna say it.
[01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:04.870]  And sometimes the family will just wait until you say it.
[01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:08.590]  Get it out there.
[01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:13.590]  I tell people, enjoy your life wherever you're at.
[01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:19.430]  Because that's all you can do consciously.
[01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:23.950]  Now you have a choice.
[01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:28.950]  You can jump into the depression thing.
[01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:30.830]  Your karma, you know?
[01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:34.590]  Might be your sentence to many years of depression.
[01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:36.670]  By your karma.
[01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:39.230]  We don't know.
[01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:40.910]  We don't know.
[01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:42.110]  But all we do know.
[01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:47.750]  If you follow the golden rule, do unto others.
[01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:53.030]  If you follow the golden rule where they say a judge not.
[01:01:54.830 --> 01:01:57.030]  And that's not judging people.
[01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:59.070]  I mean, that's activity.
[01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:04.510]  Judging people by their skin color.
[01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:06.990]  Or by their accent.
[01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:10.350]  Or by their raggedy clothes.
[01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:11.950]  That's judging.
[01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:16.110]  And if you don't judge, you free yourself.
[01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:17.310]  You're free now.
[01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:18.710]  You can see things.
[01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:23.030]  But if you judge right away, oh, that looks scary.
[01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:25.070]  Then you don't look at it anymore.
[01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:26.230]  But if you looked at it closely,
[01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:28.190]  you'd go, wow, that's beautiful.
[01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.990]  Yeah.
[01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:35.990]  It's, we as individuals, we have the power
[01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:39.910]  to be happy or unhappy.
[01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:40.990]  It's up to us.
[01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:46.750]  And with me, I choose to be happy.
[01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:48.150]  Yes.
[01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:49.750]  It's a conscious choice.
[01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:52.590]  And it's a choice that can happen and it can work.
[01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:54.750]  And that's why we're the Friendly Cannabis Show.
[01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:55.670]  Yes.
[01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:56.510]  Yep.
[01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:59.590]  Seeking the truth and the beauty and the happiness out there.
[01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:04.590]  And cannabis, it brings us to a lot of these things.
[01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:07.790]  So excellent words.
[01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:10.750]  I think those are great words to close on.
[01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:13.790]  I do wanna give you though, the opportunity before we go,
[01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.950]  if there was anything that you had upcoming
[01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:20.190]  or anything that you wanted to let people know about
[01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:21.870]  or just where to find you.
[01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:24.230]  Now you said you weren't gonna test me.
[01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:27.470]  No, no.
[01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:28.310]  No testing.
[01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:31.270]  I, you know, I was hoping though,
[01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:34.670]  for maybe if we could get a dad joke out of you.
[01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:37.230]  I don't know if you know any dad jokes, but.
[01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.150]  Dad?
[01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.990]  Yeah.
[01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:41.030]  Okay, so a dad joke is one of those ones
[01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:42.710]  it's just so bad, it's good.
[01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:44.550]  Like here's an example.
[01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:48.070]  Like why do they put fences around cemeteries?
[01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:51.550]  Cause people are dying to get in there.
[01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:00.270]  Why do seagulls fly over the sea?
[01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:03.630]  Because if they flew over the bay, they'd be a bagel.
[01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:05.590]  A bagel?
[01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:06.470]  Pshh.
[01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:11.710]  That's great, that's great dad jokes.
[01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:12.550]  Yep.
[01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:15.830]  Because I can see kids looking at each other going, oh.
[01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:20.550]  Exactly, you're like, yeah, we're not really related.
[01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:26.590]  I don't, you know, that's when I really get stuck
[01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:28.510]  when people say, give me a joke.
[01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:31.350]  They put you on the spot, I know, I know, that's so rude.
[01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:36.830]  But no, that's something again, the test, yeah.
[01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:42.270]  I will go ahead and put your Instagram
[01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:43.470]  as well as the website.
[01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:45.470]  I will put all of these in the show notes.
[01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:48.150]  So anybody who wants to find out.
[01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.990]  Yeah.
[01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.830]  You're very welcome.

[01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:04.190]  You have a wonderful evening.
[01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:05.030]  Peace and love.
[01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:06.590]  We'll see you next time.
[01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:07.630]  We'll do it again.
[01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:09.030]  Awesome, thank you, Tommy.
[01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:10.230]  You have a great night.
