[00:00.000 --> 00:09.200]  font. Cheers. Yeah, I always find fonts that I like and then I have so many fonts that I can
[00:09.200 --> 00:16.160]  never remember like which ones are the ones I liked and like where to find them. Oh for sure.
[00:16.880 --> 00:23.760]  I am. I took a poetry course at Columbia a couple summers in a row when I was a teenager
[00:23.840 --> 00:31.760]  and that is where I developed intense opinions about all fonts and which fonts were worthy
[00:31.760 --> 00:40.080]  and which fonts were. Did you watch the Helvetica documentary? No, there's a Helvetica documentary.
[00:40.080 --> 00:43.360]  Yeah. Is it metal?
[00:46.320 --> 00:52.800]  It's a yeah I'll dig up the link. I don't know if it's like on Netflix or anything but anyway you
[00:52.800 --> 01:00.400]  are live. We're live. Let's see. I'm doing the thing that it usually does where I keep
[01:00.400 --> 01:04.800]  typing in the FTP and it doesn't quite show up yet but it will show up but hi everybody.
[01:06.640 --> 01:12.560]  I know that a lot of you come to a future Catalyst project for a lot of really technical knowledge
[01:12.560 --> 01:19.520]  but Peter and I were talking about what's like a regular chill thing we can do that might like
[01:19.600 --> 01:24.800]  you know be good for the community as well as sharing all this information but also it would
[01:24.800 --> 01:32.560]  be like a chance for us to hear your stories and I kind of thought I was kind of inspired to do this
[01:32.560 --> 01:40.800]  honestly because on my Instagram live one of the friends we had watching had a milestone,
[01:40.800 --> 01:46.400]  a sobriety milestone having quit addiction to alcohol thanks to cannabis and then other people
[01:46.400 --> 01:52.320]  started sharing their stories too and it was so lovely and it just feels like nowadays more than
[01:52.320 --> 02:00.320]  ever it's a good idea to craft a raft of sanity in this ocean of madness and if that involved
[02:00.320 --> 02:07.600]  hanging out on Monday nights at 8 p.m like this so be it but yeah I've just heard so many awesome
[02:07.600 --> 02:13.120]  stories from people and I thought it would be a good idea to take Monday nights to spotlight
[02:13.120 --> 02:18.320]  medical cannabis patient stories and also recommendations and these can be done
[02:18.320 --> 02:26.080]  anonymously too. I have a quote like an example I'd like to share but also it kind of helps to
[02:26.080 --> 02:31.280]  have a little something for everyone on future cannabis projects so we can have something for
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.560]  people who want to know exactly about salinity and soil all the way to Rosman Press and to
[02:38.560 --> 02:44.560]  humanitarian work and also just personal stories which I think really pays homage to the oral
[02:44.560 --> 02:50.880]  tradition and not to mention anecdotal evidence of cannabis as a medicine. I'm gonna refresh my
[02:50.880 --> 02:57.680]  YouTube now and see if it's working. It's working. Okay oh I just I still can't see the video it's
[02:57.680 --> 03:04.400]  still doing the thing but I do have some fat dabs that I'm gonna reward myself with
[03:05.360 --> 03:13.920]  some sour diesel and some sunset sherbert. Now where are you getting that from because that's
[03:13.920 --> 03:21.520]  not like consumer size. Oh no no this is this is just from like white label to be honest.
[03:22.800 --> 03:30.000]  I and then I have oh it's downstairs but I have this like delta 8 distillate too and
[03:30.560 --> 03:36.400]  I don't know one of the things I always appreciate is nerding out over the paperwork after like like
[03:36.400 --> 03:43.680]  when like with the Doc Ray's blue skunk how it had all this lab work that came with it and it was like
[03:44.320 --> 03:51.120]  such a treat. Well yeah no so I want to talk to him about kind of what he finds like when he looks
[03:51.120 --> 03:55.520]  through the test results of cannabinoids and terpenes kind of what jumps out at him
[03:56.320 --> 04:01.680]  um in terms of its uniqueness. Certainly smelled good when I first opened it up.
[04:02.640 --> 04:07.600]  Oh same but then I haven't opened it since because I don't want to I don't want any more
[04:07.600 --> 04:12.960]  terp to evaporate and I also like that this is like a tinted uh container so UV is not
[04:12.960 --> 04:18.320]  going to get in there. Still not working let me go to the channel. Oh here we go.
[04:18.560 --> 04:22.560]  Cool. Hi hey everybody.
[04:25.680 --> 04:31.440]  All right catching up catching up cool cool I'm just seeing your comments um but yeah so I thought
[04:31.440 --> 04:36.640]  it would be nice to hear similar personal milestones from you anyone who's watching
[04:36.640 --> 04:40.400]  and or if you just want to send it to me directly and I can share anonymously
[04:40.400 --> 04:45.280]  and we can celebrate them with you like we can all do a dab to toast uh to toast
[04:46.160 --> 04:54.640]  your achievement. I feel like medical patients just they just get shit on so much. I was hearing
[04:54.640 --> 04:59.680]  about what it's like being a medical patient in Florida today and it's like growing is illegal
[04:59.680 --> 05:06.080]  and the only way to get medicine is through these really um corporate channels with and it's it's
[05:06.080 --> 05:10.880]  really hard if you need uh if you need a high doses and so I thought it'd be good to bring
[05:10.880 --> 05:16.880]  to shed some light on those stories um so yeah and I have an example from from anonymous here
[05:16.880 --> 05:21.760]  today in the United States who said I switched to vaping because I needed an alternative to
[05:21.760 --> 05:26.960]  tobacco cigarettes. If I smoked cigarettes my lungs would be 10 times worse than they are
[05:26.960 --> 05:33.200]  so they switched from um from cigarettes to to nicotine vaping and then now on to just cannabis
[05:33.200 --> 05:38.480]  and they said that they didn't want to end up like a relative of theirs who had had their health
[05:38.480 --> 05:43.840]  really horribly impacted by by continual cigarette use and I thought that was something that
[05:44.400 --> 05:49.200]  I don't know I feel like a lot of us can relate to I don't know and no hate on anyone of course
[05:49.200 --> 05:55.440]  but I'm definitely the type of stoner who will like only use hemp wraps for her blood but maybe
[05:55.440 --> 06:04.400]  that makes me new age. Wow so so Cody Monko home home growing is illegal in Pennsylvania.
[06:04.640 --> 06:07.840]  It is? Yeah that's all right that's the impression I'm getting.
[06:09.520 --> 06:11.520]  We'll get confirmation any second.
[06:13.200 --> 06:19.280]  Uh it's illegal in VA too so so all right can people just say what state they're in if it is
[06:19.280 --> 06:25.440]  illegal to actually have a home grow indoor or outdoor? So Virginia is illegal for home grow
[06:25.440 --> 06:32.560]  pencil that's fucked up um mad men must be in in that state and behind that law.
[06:35.120 --> 06:38.800]  Oh I always look for opportunities to throw them under the bus.
[06:39.440 --> 06:44.960]  Is that really something they advocate? Oh yeah in Massachusetts so it was either
[06:44.960 --> 06:48.880]  mass yeah I think it was Massachusetts or maybe New York or something that uh
[06:49.920 --> 06:55.840]  uh all right so Ninja Ghost can tell yeah Texas I am so sorry Ed.
[06:56.800 --> 07:05.760]  Oh oh yeah but Bingo Lombardi uh can you grow it I see it's medical only but can you have like
[07:05.760 --> 07:15.200]  your six plants? Oh yeah Florida illegal being confirmed by BM Kushmaster. Well Brandon what
[07:15.200 --> 07:21.440]  about I I assume of Oklahoma's the wild west and anything goes that it's also probably you can
[07:21.440 --> 07:27.600]  definitely grow your six plants at home or is it the wild west of home grows too where you can grow
[07:27.600 --> 07:39.960]  unlimited plants at home? I'm just touching the my. Suavito Dadan can you grow six plants at home
[07:39.960 --> 07:53.500]  in St. Martin? Fubar says it's illegal to think about cannabis in Texas. Yeah no. I know how that
[07:53.500 --> 07:58.540]  feels I was uh born and raised in Hong Kong and cannabis is treated on the same level as
[07:58.540 --> 08:05.500]  amphetamines and and party drugs in Hong Kong and it's and it's very very not cool and so I just I
[08:05.500 --> 08:12.060]  think the first time I ever saw nug instead of butt hash it just blew my mind I was like what is this?
[08:15.100 --> 08:21.580]  Oh four plants legal in one state in Australia. Fascinating.
[08:24.860 --> 08:29.900]  I um I just I isn't it I think it's Australia where you're not allowed to grow tobacco which
[08:29.900 --> 08:36.620]  is kind of that blew my mind that uh I mean I I have like eight tobacco plants growing outside
[08:36.620 --> 08:45.500]  right I actually have my I have seeds here. Tobacco plants I mean this and and each pod is
[08:45.500 --> 08:54.720]  probably like a hundred seeds or more so. That's so rough for Florida. I'm gonna let them go wild
[08:54.720 --> 09:03.520]  in uh in LA. Um that's so rough about Florida I didn't know that until today it really it really
[09:03.520 --> 09:11.440]  stops people from like providing for themselves which is seems I just I just brought our Oklahoma
[09:12.000 --> 09:21.280]  there's our Oklahoma correspondent. Yeah. So wait in Oklahoma you can grow you said 12 plants or 10?
[09:22.000 --> 09:31.520]  Uh 12 plants so you can have uh six mature and six immature uh and it's like you know so you could
[09:32.080 --> 09:38.560]  have like six you know 20 foot plants if you want. Yeah no that's what I was saying you could have
[09:38.560 --> 09:43.520]  some big boy plants in your backyard and you can grow outdoors too right I assume your your home
[09:43.520 --> 09:52.000]  grow. Yeah absolutely yeah it's great out here uh as far as um as far as home grow is can is
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.040]  considered um it's you know it's almost kind of like the places that have it are kind of almost
[09:57.040 --> 10:06.720]  standard cost support it's usually the same six flowering uh six immature um it's great here nobody
[10:06.720 --> 10:13.280]  seems to bother anybody it's uh kind of one of those things where like it's weird because
[10:13.920 --> 10:21.280]  cannabis hasn't been here that long uh but nobody cares about it like as far as like you know the
[10:21.280 --> 10:30.480]  laws are so lax there are places where you can consume like in public and eat food and you know
[10:30.480 --> 10:36.640]  that's it's just different from everywhere else. Yeah it's like all the corporate fuckery hasn't
[10:36.640 --> 10:42.880]  caught up yet. Yeah yeah so that's that's a really interesting point right so one of the
[10:42.880 --> 10:52.400]  cool things is that since licensing is so low um it's allowed more and vertical integration too
[10:52.400 --> 11:00.000]  is a huge thing so you could uh create a business model that's totally cohesive and not have to be
[11:00.080 --> 11:06.960]  really wealthy um there's a lot of there's a lot of farms out here that are smaller right that are
[11:06.960 --> 11:14.400]  doing um you know boutique style stuff and so more people can operate and I think what happens
[11:14.960 --> 11:21.680]  when more people are able to participate what happens is the economy as a whole
[11:22.240 --> 11:26.880]  increases because it's not just cannabis business it's all the things that are attached to cannabis
[11:27.440 --> 11:36.560]  heating and air uh electricians uh you know planning development people it's just everything
[11:36.560 --> 11:42.880]  is incorporated property and real estate um what I see out here in Oklahoma is it's super super
[11:42.880 --> 11:51.120]  inexpensive to live out here but property is on the rise and I'm seeing a lot of the old run down
[11:51.120 --> 11:58.640]  parts of the city that are that were just not being used they're all they're all being sold
[11:58.640 --> 12:05.600]  people are taking them over it's it's huge down here so it's like a real estate resurgence too
[12:05.600 --> 12:11.040]  yeah it's like a revitalization but but do you predict kind of a massive collapse at some point
[12:11.040 --> 12:16.960]  I mean it seems like everybody's pouring in and that kind of plays out one way pretty much all
[12:16.960 --> 12:23.760]  the time I think that we're close enough to federal legislation that I think Oklahoma has a
[12:23.760 --> 12:32.240]  real opportunity to become a hub for cannabis uh one because there are a lot of shipping companies
[12:32.240 --> 12:37.840]  that operate out of here because it is a central hub so people like myself I hope to be able to
[12:37.840 --> 12:43.600]  use profits from you know my farm and stuff to be able to acquire like terroir cannabis from
[12:43.600 --> 12:50.800]  northern California and have a supply chain where I can distribute from Oklahoma to the rest of the
[12:50.800 --> 12:57.760]  United States uh surrounding areas particularly because there's like Texas is below us there
[12:58.320 --> 13:04.320]  they have medical but it's not it's like nobody's doing anything it's so restricted
[13:05.200 --> 13:13.040]  and that's 60 million people below Oklahoma and then we have like Arkansas to the east
[13:13.920 --> 13:20.640]  they have a medical program but they're not fully back Oklahoma's not wrecked New Mexico's not wrecked
[13:21.840 --> 13:30.320]  so we have a lot of states around us that it just it just all works kind of cohesively
[13:30.320 --> 13:34.480]  uh I think that once federal legislation we're going to be and it's good to build brands right
[13:34.480 --> 13:40.320]  people are able to build brands here because they're able to operate mama pop shops right and
[13:40.320 --> 13:45.440]  they're able to get their products on the shelves and so that's a you know it's just
[13:46.080 --> 13:49.360]  there's just so much going on here and so many people are participating
[13:50.880 --> 13:56.960]  yeah it's it's kind of like I mean your point before was whatever your specific idea of a
[13:56.960 --> 14:03.600]  business vision is you can just run with it and not like have like bureau like a 100 pound
[14:03.600 --> 14:09.120]  bureaucracy on your shoulders as you're trying to run your like merit your personal business marathon
[14:10.640 --> 14:18.720]  yeah taxes are low here too licensing is cheap um you know it's a it's a red state so there's
[14:18.720 --> 14:23.920]  it seems like there's just less limitations on your freedoms personal business and otherwise
[14:27.180 --> 14:34.540]  yeah I want to get uh so I I sent doc the uh we'll wait for doc so so we I want to smoke that
[14:35.100 --> 14:40.380]  Brandon you don't you can smoke your own stuff but we both have uh this guy doc ray uh
[14:41.340 --> 14:49.580]  who's a an old school dude up in humble um we're patiently waiting for him to to try his weed out
[14:50.140 --> 14:54.860]  I have hardly any flower pieces like literally right before I was like oh he might come on I
[14:54.860 --> 14:58.860]  could have scramble and I could only find one but everything else in my house is a dab rig
[14:59.820 --> 15:07.580]  so Kevin Jojury I want to know if uh what are bull testicles Rocky Mountain oysters I want to know
[15:07.580 --> 15:14.540]  if you have if you have taken your revenge on the bulls and eaten the Rocky Mountain oysters
[15:18.060 --> 15:24.300]  that's not something I've heard yeah Kevin's neighbor's bulls got into his yard and they were
[15:24.300 --> 15:33.660]  like fighting each other uh or into his grow not not his yard Kevin Jojury's yeah yeah oh man yeah
[15:33.660 --> 15:39.180]  you know what we have cows on our farm they're not our cows we're letting them graze to uh keep the
[15:40.620 --> 15:47.500]  keep the the weeds and the foliage to a minimum um but I was warned like you can't have cows near
[15:47.500 --> 15:56.460]  cannabis can't have any animals near cannabis they're gonna get in there yeah I just uh I'm
[15:56.460 --> 16:07.820]  about to upload a not animals but pests so so in Tom's uh massive like 10 plant home grow operation
[16:07.820 --> 16:14.940]  we basically had a caterpillar infestation and uh so I went to Rhode Island to visit my parents
[16:15.900 --> 16:22.460]  and like five days later he was like something's wrong everything's all all the colas are all the
[16:22.460 --> 16:30.380]  buds are turning brown I was like I was like take a knife and like like get or like your fingers and
[16:30.380 --> 16:35.580]  just start like seeing if you can see any caterpillars in there and then uh I got back
[16:35.580 --> 16:42.700]  and I went over there on I guess it was Saturday and uh my daughter loves to go over there and
[16:43.660 --> 16:50.780]  and garden um but uh and we brought this guy Saul who's an IPM expert and we
[16:51.580 --> 16:59.100]  uh discovered that literally every cola had I mean there was like caterpillar poop are you growing
[17:00.140 --> 17:09.660]  outdoor as well yes uh I grow outdoor here uh I actually harvested everything because what I did
[17:09.740 --> 17:16.380]  was as opposed to doing my own medicine this year I did a breeding program with uh mean genes lime
[17:16.380 --> 17:24.140]  one bx because I had the opportunity to um pop like I think I popped man close to like 400 seeds
[17:24.940 --> 17:30.220]  like some of them didn't make it and then I think I like maybe like 120 of those seeds were male
[17:30.220 --> 17:34.700]  and then the rest were female I hunted through all the females and then I only kept one male
[17:34.700 --> 17:40.460]  out of all the males that were in that full hunt and it was that uh lime one bx I just really love
[17:40.460 --> 17:47.020]  the uh morphology of the leaf structures one of the broadest uh leaf sets that I've ever cultivated
[17:47.580 --> 17:53.580]  um and it has a great profile it actually has the uh it has the front end of the lime
[17:53.580 --> 17:59.980]  arilla where it brings on that floral chem lime um and it's just that right there uh the lime
[17:59.980 --> 18:05.980]  arilla has a another layer on top of it where it has like this uh this like earthy
[18:06.620 --> 18:14.060]  pungent like the glue it kind of has the glue entwined with that as well um and so
[18:15.500 --> 18:23.340]  uh I used uh one of the lime arillas I used some exclusive cuts and I just put them in my backyard
[18:23.340 --> 18:27.420]  and I took that male and I just hit everything in my backyard with it
[18:32.060 --> 18:39.100]  interesting I want to say speaking of cannabis um seeds and letting animals
[18:39.900 --> 18:43.900]  rage and roam where they will what's the story behind your parrot that I got to see on your
[18:43.900 --> 18:57.100]  stories today uh I was definitely digging the uh the seeds right so I got lucky uh I want to say
[18:57.100 --> 19:03.180]  probably like maybe four and a half years ago um he was like a rescue bird the guy had him and he
[19:03.180 --> 19:06.780]  the bird wasn't really socialized that much and the guy was going through a bunch of heart surgeries
[19:07.420 --> 19:13.180]  uh I picked him up and it was just like oh man I probably shouldn't have done this because he was
[19:13.180 --> 19:18.060]  just like all over the place he wasn't really social so I had to do a bunch of work with him
[19:18.060 --> 19:21.980]  and like get him in public I used to take him to the farmer's market in Ocean Beach when I lived
[19:21.980 --> 19:30.380]  out in San Diego um and I just had to work with him a lot and so he's a lot better but he's he's
[19:30.380 --> 19:37.820]  like a familiar if you're familiar with what that is so he's kind of like a demon trapped in this like
[19:37.820 --> 19:45.980]  cute little bird thing but he's so mysterious he is beautiful he's great he's a great bird but um
[19:45.980 --> 19:52.780]  you know he he loves he loves weed um and it's not like something that I forced on him or anything
[19:52.780 --> 20:00.700]  um he always wants to be a part of what's going on so whenever I was trimming uh he'd want to be
[20:00.700 --> 20:07.020]  there like right on the trim tray and he'd be going through like you know I would let him tear
[20:07.020 --> 20:12.380]  up some weed a little bit you know because it's just like he that's what he wants to do you know
[20:12.380 --> 20:17.580]  and what it really comes down to though is he likes the big huge stalks and the stems because
[20:17.580 --> 20:22.700]  what he'll do is he'll he'll strip them down into these little fibers and just keeps them occupied
[20:22.700 --> 20:29.020]  it gives them something to do because macaws spend most of their life in the wild foraging for food
[20:29.660 --> 20:36.940]  so they need to be stimulated they need a lot of stimulation that's why he's so that's why
[20:36.940 --> 20:42.460]  he's all over the place exploring the house getting into things because he's naturally inclined
[20:42.460 --> 20:49.020]  to forage for food but since he's already provided food he needs another way to expend that energy
[20:49.020 --> 20:56.140]  wait just quickly why can't I find your uh personal I know I saw that earlier today what
[20:56.140 --> 21:02.460]  what's your it's not the Bokashi what's that no it's because I'm shadow banned I'm shadow banned
[21:02.460 --> 21:09.180]  on IG like super bad they won't let me like I'm on actually restriction I tried to do some stuff
[21:09.180 --> 21:16.140]  and they said hey you're restricted until October 16th you can't do live videos you can't uh post
[21:16.140 --> 21:22.380]  like certain videos it's super weird I'm crazy censored on IG which is really weird because
[21:22.380 --> 21:26.940]  mostly it's just like I'm showing either pictures of weed or I'm like doing some education stuff
[21:27.500 --> 21:32.460]  yeah I know you're really diligent about saying education only no sales on your content
[21:32.460 --> 21:38.540]  but that can happen sometimes if um be careful this is just generally good advice if to avoid
[21:38.540 --> 21:44.220]  getting shadow banned uh don't ever like copy paste captions and stuff because that can that
[21:44.220 --> 21:48.540]  can make it think you're a bot but maybe it's another reason that's that's really annoying to
[21:48.540 --> 21:53.260]  have to deal with but at the same time I'm really glad your macaw has a second chance at life
[21:53.500 --> 22:03.100]  yeah he's a he's a good bird he's you know I think the the guy that I got him from told me that
[22:03.980 --> 22:09.100]  he found him at the bottom of the cage and he was like almost dead he had to nurse him so I think he
[22:09.100 --> 22:18.060]  has some trauma that you know is associated with whoever had him as a as a baby um so it's you
[22:18.060 --> 22:23.100]  know working with trauma just like in any situation whether it's an animal or a person
[22:23.100 --> 22:28.460]  it takes a little bit of time and it takes a little bit of compassion and um you know I'm
[22:28.460 --> 22:34.620]  super busy so I honestly I don't get to spend as uh enough time but he's pretty well taken care of
[22:35.180 --> 22:41.180]  he's free to roam the house and he gets treats all the time that's something that we in the
[22:41.180 --> 22:48.540]  cannabis community know all about we know all about PTSD and how sudden and patience and and
[22:49.180 --> 22:53.580]  and treatments that are necessary for trauma that's awesome and I also it's funny that to
[22:53.580 --> 23:00.620]  me that he likes stems somebody's got you yeah you know that it's it's a really interesting
[23:02.060 --> 23:08.140]  thing because I've often been like you know what a lot of these stems would just go to waste and
[23:08.140 --> 23:13.740]  they could be chopped up and used for bird treats I mean it's it wouldn't be a bad business model
[23:13.740 --> 23:19.260]  because essentially you're just turning trash into something that's usable and they really love it and
[23:19.260 --> 23:23.900]  I you know my only concern was like okay so now I'm gonna I have to test this make sure there's
[23:24.460 --> 23:32.380]  you know it's hemp you know it has less it's stocks and birds love it it's it's not just him
[23:32.380 --> 23:39.980]  I had another bird who unfortunately flew away while I was in prison but he uh he would do the
[23:39.980 --> 23:45.340]  same thing he just loved cannabis stocks and they like to strip all the little fibers out of them
[23:45.340 --> 23:57.420]  like one by one it's like they're teething yeah they need to be occupied I feel like stems get a
[23:57.420 --> 24:02.460]  bad rap for how economic they can be though I remember being a baby stoner on the east coast
[24:02.460 --> 24:07.820]  and all I could get I had a kind of friend who like worked as a trimmer and had all these like
[24:07.820 --> 24:13.180]  leftover stems and we used to just like boil them lightly in butter for ages and like that was the
[24:13.180 --> 24:18.140]  that was all we had for over one winter you gotta do what you gotta do sometimes
[24:19.100 --> 24:24.940]  one of the cool things out here in Oklahoma is there's uh green waste recycling companies so
[24:25.580 --> 24:31.500]  I work I work with a company called stealth recycling and they um they collect cannabis
[24:31.500 --> 24:36.460]  waste things like stems and they actually they they put them through like an industrial size
[24:36.460 --> 24:41.260]  mulching machine and they turn them into like particulates like really really small fine
[24:41.260 --> 24:47.340]  particle material not particles but like really fine material and then they're using my uh micro
[24:47.340 --> 24:54.060]  plus the uh the uh em micro plus fours and they're turning it into a bio fertilizers like uh
[24:54.700 --> 24:59.980]  I like I do at my facility um they're doing it on a much larger scale and they're able to source
[24:59.980 --> 25:04.860]  material from different places throughout the state and they're building a business model
[25:04.860 --> 25:11.340]  off of the green waste recycling using a solid state anaerobic fermentation are are you allowed
[25:11.340 --> 25:16.780]  to use your own green waste and make compost or or do you have to have a third part like get it
[25:16.780 --> 25:23.740]  off site and I mean I know California has I think some weird they so there's actually a license out
[25:23.740 --> 25:30.700]  here for green waste collection um it's written in the laws that well we have a processing license
[25:31.820 --> 25:40.220]  um we're vertically integrated so I can compost my own material I can turn it into green waste
[25:40.220 --> 25:47.260]  and that is what I do with the majority of my material is I I do a solid state fermentation
[25:47.260 --> 25:55.580]  and then I drain the liquid I'm left with you know uh like leaf matter that's all broken down
[25:55.580 --> 26:00.540]  there's not really much in it and that can just go like into the soil outside for you know to
[26:00.540 --> 26:05.740]  add biology and it'll decompose in the soil and help the soil and then I take all the extract
[26:05.740 --> 26:12.060]  liquid and that contains all the nutrient minerals and a bunch of microbiology and it can be reused
[26:12.060 --> 26:16.380]  to go back into the system that it was pulled out of so it's kind of like closing the loop
[26:17.500 --> 26:23.660]  did you mention it's a anaerobic process too yeah it's called solid state fermentation
[26:24.700 --> 26:31.500]  and it's similar to hydrolysis and the fact that uh there's so much lactic acid bacteria or
[26:31.500 --> 26:38.380]  bacillus species that that create the lactic acid and that lactic acid is a you know it's a weak
[26:38.380 --> 26:45.100]  organic acid that breaks things down but it's the consortium of the different microbes in there that
[26:45.100 --> 26:53.020]  really work together to um to actually it's it's it's interesting the way that it works because it
[26:53.020 --> 26:59.180]  can take things that are mineralized that are not in an organically available form and it has the
[26:59.180 --> 27:11.100]  ability to reduce them through a redox like a redox process um so it's I don't know it's it's
[27:11.180 --> 27:16.460]  it's just a really easy way to like you know collect something that would be taken out of an
[27:16.460 --> 27:24.540]  organic system and put it back in that's um that's fascinating that it's also about the group
[27:24.540 --> 27:29.660]  of microbes too it's like kind of like the entourage effect or something once it had some
[27:29.660 --> 27:36.380]  diversity is what ends up being the strength of the of the compound or the effect when it comes
[27:37.100 --> 27:43.260]  to biology so much like over and over again we learn this is true yeah I think that um
[27:44.140 --> 27:52.540]  what happens is you can get benefits from certain biological aspects um but what happens is there
[27:52.540 --> 27:58.620]  are certain consortiums that actually work together really really well and then what happens is they
[27:58.620 --> 28:02.780]  work like an engine like you know you need gas air and spark for an engine to work you know you
[28:02.860 --> 28:07.900]  can't get them to work unless you have all three so some of these microorganisms they actually
[28:07.900 --> 28:13.500]  work like that where um some of the secondary metabolites that they're producing let's say the
[28:13.500 --> 28:20.380]  you know if something produces a polysaccharide right which is just a dual uh sugar complex
[28:20.380 --> 28:26.300]  complicated yeah so there's other things like the yeast that can take that polysaccharide and it can
[28:26.300 --> 28:30.300]  feed off that and then convert that into another chemical compound it might be like an amino acid
[28:30.540 --> 28:37.980]  it might be another secondary metabolite like uh like a something that's a pgr you know like maybe
[28:37.980 --> 28:42.620]  uh you know a hormone that the plant can utilize so there's different things that are happening
[28:42.620 --> 28:49.500]  with the microbes and they release different um secondary metabolites that's fabulous hi doc
[28:51.260 --> 28:54.540]  how are you doing so
[28:55.260 --> 28:57.340]  we've both been patiently waiting
[28:59.820 --> 29:05.100]  a long long day of knocking trees down in Humboldt County but
[29:06.140 --> 29:11.660]  I'm on the couch and being still after a long day and taking a little rip and
[29:12.780 --> 29:17.900]  saying hello to you sister good to see you again hope you're doing good oh it's so good to see you
[29:18.220 --> 29:24.860]  we were just talking about and yeah Brandon is here too we haven't um Peter and I have been
[29:24.860 --> 29:31.260]  very uh disciplined and I don't think either of us have embarked on our blue skunk try we want to
[29:31.260 --> 29:40.940]  do it live are you smoking blue skunk tonight nice uh I I'm I am I am sister I'm I'm that's
[29:41.100 --> 29:46.380]  like what I'm smoking right now as a daily smoker I'm testing a lot of new things that I'm playing
[29:46.380 --> 29:51.340]  with and some old things that I'm you know getting ready to put back out for this one more time in
[29:51.340 --> 29:58.060]  the season that whole thing so but yeah right now it's uh blue skunk and a glass of water on the
[29:58.060 --> 30:03.020]  couch and hanging out with you for a little while lovely Brandon are you smoking anything right now
[30:03.180 --> 30:08.780]  I am I'm smoking some of my lima rolla I'm like getting to the ends though I'm going to have to
[30:08.780 --> 30:13.580]  I'm gonna have to re-up here if you're like getting to the ends but the amount that you
[30:13.580 --> 30:21.580]  just gestured with would have blown my mind like when I was 18 or so yeah I mean the dregs
[30:21.740 --> 30:28.380]  so doc why don't you tell us a little about kind of blue skunk from kind of its origins to
[30:29.020 --> 30:34.620]  how it grows how it can do that and then actually what I really like at some point
[30:34.620 --> 30:40.300]  I want you to kind of talk about what jumped out at you when you were a kid
[30:40.300 --> 30:45.260]  and what you were like when you were a kid and what you were like when you were a kid
[30:46.220 --> 30:54.300]  at some point I want you to kind of talk about what jumped out at you like when you know the
[30:54.300 --> 31:03.420]  sc labs tests like the cannabinoids the terpenes like what from from just an analytic standpoint
[31:03.420 --> 31:10.940]  made it unique yeah because we got that lab testing we were like whoa well you know it's
[31:11.900 --> 31:18.700]  yeah this has been a long a long long long journey for me and and really the the plant
[31:18.700 --> 31:24.940]  this particular plant is like the culmination of a lot of work over the last 14 years of my time in
[31:24.940 --> 31:36.540]  the craft of 48 years in the craft so that being said the what okay I like the blue dream plant
[31:36.620 --> 31:40.860]  really because of the cerebral aspects of the plant you know that part of it that calms your
[31:40.860 --> 31:45.660]  mind it's it's a great you know as we I guess we used to refer to it like a party weed you know
[31:45.660 --> 31:49.420]  where everybody sit and talk and relax and have a good time it decompresses and stuff
[31:49.980 --> 31:57.020]  and just with my own experience in breeding plants you know like my focus like before that
[31:57.020 --> 32:01.180]  time period had all been like for cancer and epilepsy and things like that where I was focusing
[32:01.180 --> 32:07.660]  on things really specifically for what was needed in our medical community to meet those demands
[32:08.700 --> 32:13.820]  this particular plant was like this one is like really close to me because it's like something I
[32:13.820 --> 32:19.260]  worked on very privately for up until just a couple of years ago this was my personal daily smoker
[32:19.900 --> 32:23.980]  that I didn't really let people have access to unless you were in you know really close to me
[32:23.980 --> 32:30.060]  in my circle of friends and you knew me and those kind of things so that being said Peter what you're
[32:30.060 --> 32:35.500]  talking about is what brought me to work on this plant is is you know I'm an old beat up old
[32:35.500 --> 32:41.660]  veteran I've been blown up a couple of times and left for dead a couple of times and you know and
[32:41.660 --> 32:47.340]  I'm a rowdy old boy too you know I'm an old Harley rider and I've you know been in a couple motorcycle
[32:47.340 --> 32:53.420]  wrecks and been you know left on the side of the road dead a couple of times and have head damage so
[32:54.220 --> 33:00.460]  the blue dream aspect of the plant really you know it really helped me you know keep my balance
[33:00.460 --> 33:06.700]  keep myself calm kept me chill you know maybe maybe be a you know a relaxed old man that I am
[33:06.700 --> 33:12.460]  today you know and and I fortunately for me you know the circles that I run I'm friends with a
[33:12.460 --> 33:16.940]  lot of old school breeders and old crap people that nobody does you know they don't do social
[33:16.940 --> 33:21.580]  media and they don't do Instagram and all that kind of jazz you know I'm fortunate enough to know
[33:21.980 --> 33:26.700]  the breeder of the blue dream is a dear sister friend of mine and that's where I got mine from
[33:26.700 --> 33:30.620]  right out of Santa Cruz County blue dream you know doesn't get any closer than the source that
[33:30.620 --> 33:39.500]  Santa Cruz County for getting your blue dream strain from 06 took my you know it didn't even
[33:39.500 --> 33:44.780]  again we've had this conversation Peter you know that my OG my skunk OG you know it was called
[33:44.780 --> 33:50.060]  old Dave you know old Dave's an old breeder that's been dead for a decade that this generation you
[33:50.060 --> 33:55.100]  know but Dave had his hands in many many fine craft cannabis strains that are known throughout
[33:55.100 --> 34:02.460]  the triangle here that are building block strains you know that my old Dave with the blue dream kind
[34:02.460 --> 34:09.580]  of started this project 14 or so years ago after I said I couldn't stand it anymore and I disappeared
[34:09.580 --> 34:16.060]  out of the commercial craft and just got away from the industry and unplugged from it and
[34:16.380 --> 34:21.020]  long story short that particular plant something that I've spent a lot of time and energy and
[34:21.020 --> 34:26.780]  one it's very beautiful to look at it smokes it's divine smoke it's very cerebral in your head
[34:28.140 --> 34:31.980]  I get and I get the same response over and over from now to the point where I'm getting that same
[34:31.980 --> 34:37.260]  response over and over again for not just a few friends but thousands and thousands of people and
[34:37.260 --> 34:43.740]  and Mia and Peter you know you guys are now have it in your hands and I'm assuming and I don't want
[34:44.540 --> 34:48.140]  to be that way but I'm assuming the response to be the same because I've had other people that
[34:48.140 --> 34:54.220]  I've sent it to out this this current season out sent samples out to and literally responses like
[34:54.220 --> 35:00.860]  it's grounding uh best sleep I've ever had and you know best high I've had you know again I don't
[35:00.860 --> 35:06.300]  need people to tell me my freaking fire cannabis is fire I know my cannabis is fire my point is is
[35:06.300 --> 35:13.580]  this helps with people with post-traumatic stress anxiety stress reduction and the beautiful
[35:13.580 --> 35:20.220]  part about this is this cross specifically because of the double indica cross it is uh it
[35:20.220 --> 35:24.940]  has great therapeutic qualities for aches and pains on your shoulders and backs and stuff and
[35:24.940 --> 35:30.620]  I laugh people it's like after an inhalation in about 20-30 minutes or so you go all of a sudden
[35:30.620 --> 35:35.820]  your shoulder doesn't hurt your back doesn't hurt and your head's clear that's the medical
[35:35.820 --> 35:42.780]  application of this plant okay now the sc lab stuff that you're referring to Peter that
[35:43.820 --> 35:49.420]  okay again this is just anybody can google this you can read this the terpene profile on this
[35:49.420 --> 35:55.180]  literally is textbook is great for anxiety it's great for pain control it's great for anti
[35:55.180 --> 36:04.460]  inflammatory the three primary terpenes in are in that profile as you can see there okay again
[36:05.020 --> 36:11.020]  it's middle of the road you know it's just a smidge under 20 percent THCA in it okay it what
[36:11.020 --> 36:17.260]  it doesn't but what you will see on there also is it has CBG and it is THCB and it which are both
[36:17.260 --> 36:23.020]  great for your body and then if you look on there there's a lot of there's just a slew of other
[36:23.020 --> 36:26.940]  things that it doesn't really show up but that there are just trace amounts of just a slew of
[36:26.940 --> 36:31.100]  all the other profiles of terpenes in there so this is what's considered full spectrum
[36:31.820 --> 36:38.860]  case you know just a little bit of THCBD in it not as much as I'm working on building that up
[36:38.860 --> 36:43.340]  right now because I want to get it up to a couple of percent and get it up up where it actually is
[36:43.340 --> 36:47.900]  real viable you know that being said and I have other things that I'm working on but this one
[36:47.900 --> 36:54.700]  specifically is really to me is tailored towards my first responder community my veteran community
[36:54.700 --> 37:01.340]  post-traumatic stress helping people have a vibe I work I'm working with some of the best medical
[37:01.340 --> 37:05.980]  people in their fields civilians in their fields now and we're getting this into a point where
[37:05.980 --> 37:10.140]  we're going to try and get this out where we can have tests on this to see viable treatment
[37:10.140 --> 37:15.900]  cannabis therapy is a viable treatment for post-traumatic stress within our veteran community
[37:15.900 --> 37:21.580]  and that's where it's gotten to at this point now this is all and this is like fast tracking man and
[37:21.580 --> 37:27.820]  so what's happened in 18 months for 40 freaking years and it's happened in 18 months and sister
[37:27.820 --> 37:31.660]  you know our our interaction's been brief but just in the time period that we've been hanging out and
[37:31.660 --> 37:36.620]  talking together for a few weeks now it's like how things are moving so fast as the doors are
[37:37.340 --> 37:43.260]  I believe really that our medical community they want access to what we do in our neighborhood they
[37:43.260 --> 37:48.780]  and again I hold nothing against Mississippi State it's not the Frippin' Emerald Triangle
[37:48.780 --> 37:52.700]  that's the bottom line you know it's our neighborhood they want access to us this is
[37:52.700 --> 37:58.220]  something that our community's done for over close to a century now you know it's like that we you
[37:58.220 --> 38:03.980]  know we paid with blood sweat and tears personal sacrifices were tried and true old school you know
[38:03.980 --> 38:07.580]  we need to have access to that kind of stuff because that's where the real medicine part of
[38:07.580 --> 38:13.900]  it comes in me personally you know I get it I'm an old school craft medical breeder it's what I
[38:13.900 --> 38:20.860]  prefer to keep myself in I do you know I understand the intoxicant part of it I have things you can't
[38:20.860 --> 38:25.420]  get off the couch after 20 minutes I understand that and there is a percentage of that that this
[38:25.420 --> 38:31.500]  will go into that market it's going to be into dispensaries Mia it will be under the VCC you
[38:31.500 --> 38:37.500]  know Veterans Choice Cannabis label sometime coming out in 2021 COVID screwed that up this
[38:37.500 --> 38:42.140]  year and a couple other foo bars that happened anyway Adapt and Overcome and we're moving forward
[38:42.140 --> 38:48.060]  on that if you have access to me what you have you know DocRay Genetics that's just strictly
[38:48.060 --> 38:54.140]  for me to friends to try and get it out there I'm working with high tide distribution to get it move
[38:54.140 --> 39:00.220]  it into where we can get the VCC line blown out a little bit more and get it in California a little
[39:00.220 --> 39:06.380]  bit better my biggest obstacle right now I'm really trying to do is find quality craft growers that can
[39:06.380 --> 39:11.420]  get my you know get my cultivars up to a large enough scale to get it out where we get out there
[39:11.420 --> 39:16.620]  because you know me I'm you know old man doing my three to five pounds in my backyard every season
[39:16.620 --> 39:21.260]  and that's just kind of what it what it has been until the last couple years and it's just really
[39:21.260 --> 39:28.140]  getting it out like in the last 12 months even since the end of last year just in less than a
[39:28.140 --> 39:32.620]  year since since the Emerald Cup of last year all these things have just snowballed right to this
[39:32.620 --> 39:38.860]  point where the research starting to come out is backing up what a lot of us here in this neighborhood
[39:38.860 --> 39:43.020]  which I'm in Humboldt County but I grew up in Mendocino County you know I've got friends in
[39:43.020 --> 39:48.860]  Trinity it's like it's the heart of the true Emerald Triangle it's like we've been doing this for a
[39:48.860 --> 39:54.940]  long time and and I just I hope that we can this this community this technology community can
[39:54.940 --> 40:01.980]  embrace this older community that of us old school growers and breeders to bring them into the fold
[40:01.980 --> 40:06.540]  because there's some really really true one-of-a-kind things out there Peter I'm you know I'm
[40:06.540 --> 40:10.860]  good at what I do but hell everybody in my neighborhood is good at what they do you know we
[40:10.860 --> 40:16.460]  all grow fire in this neighborhood you know there isn't any bad cannabis and by anybody that I know
[40:17.020 --> 40:21.340]  a lot of my friends quite honestly I think they're better at their craft than what I am I just happen
[40:21.340 --> 40:26.140]  to be a really good medical breeder you know I'm finally getting the as you said brother I'm finally
[40:26.140 --> 40:30.540]  having the opportunity to have the science work and back it up and and work I want to work with
[40:30.540 --> 40:36.940]  people working you know type cultivars to chemovars and use the science with it and match pairs up you
[40:36.940 --> 40:42.060]  know one of the my big things Peter is you know is I want to work on Ethan Russo's wish list you
[40:42.060 --> 40:45.980]  know I would really like to have a shot at that and working on with it with Ethan and having that
[40:46.060 --> 40:57.820]  opportunity you know anyway so so just quickly as as we both try the blue skunk I just want to say

[43:33.400 --> 43:38.400]  You know that I think there's just a delay because you're so far away.
[43:38.400 --> 43:43.400]  So you're probably hear me a little bit after I talk and then we're going to hear you a
[43:44.400 --> 43:49.400]  little bit after also we'll just give you a little bit of time to respond.
[43:49.400 --> 43:50.400]  Okay.
[43:50.400 --> 43:51.400]  Perfect.
[43:51.400 --> 44:02.400]  So Haroon, what what's what's going on in Afghanistan right now?
[44:02.400 --> 44:09.400]  With the hash scene and obviously it's harvest season right now, right?
[44:10.400 --> 44:12.400]  Yes, the harvest season is closed.
[44:12.400 --> 44:23.400]  Maybe in two months the harvest seasons arrive but nowadays there is a problem with the hashish
[44:23.400 --> 44:30.400]  cultivation with the Taliban is don't allow in some village to grow hashish and they cut
[44:30.400 --> 44:38.400]  some plants of some farmer plants and some they damaged some cannabis farm the Taliban
[44:38.400 --> 44:42.400]  they allow the opium and the other things but I don't know what they do with the cannabis
[44:42.400 --> 44:46.400]  right now in Afghanistan, especially in northern provinces.
[44:46.400 --> 44:53.400]  Yeah, cannabis culture is very deep in Afghanistan among the farmer.
[44:53.400 --> 44:59.400]  Yeah, they every farmer in Afghanistan they cultivate some plants for their selves.
[45:00.400 --> 45:10.400]  Yeah, but the extraction the extraction method is very here is very deep and very very old
[45:10.400 --> 45:17.400]  and very and also very knowledge knowledge of a lot of knowledge that they do very good
[45:17.400 --> 45:19.400]  things and did for dry sieving.
[45:19.400 --> 45:26.400]  I mean in dry sieving hashish in Afghanistan is very big because I tasted a lot of hashish
[45:26.400 --> 45:32.400]  in a world like India hashish, Pakistani hashish in some other countries and also extracted
[45:32.400 --> 45:37.400]  but it they don't compare with the Afghanistan extract extracted hashish like in the northern
[45:37.400 --> 45:39.400]  provinces like a Balkh provinces.
[45:39.400 --> 45:46.400]  Balkh provinces were very deep in hashish culture and everything you can find every
[45:46.400 --> 45:53.400]  picture every picture of lost every lost picture of from the history of hashish you can find
[45:53.400 --> 46:03.400]  there in a chilem houses and among the former among some damaged like a circle is a damaged
[46:03.400 --> 46:11.400]  chilem circle it is in a Balkh old and ancient city of Balkh it was about it like this in
[46:11.400 --> 46:21.400]  Afghanistan hashish is but it just it is not legal here but we hope to some someday it
[46:21.400 --> 46:27.400]  become legal and all the world access to Afghanistan original hashish because it is like
[46:27.400 --> 46:32.400]  artists working like work like a medicine yeah it's like a good hashish.
[46:32.400 --> 46:40.400]  It's like its own territory, it's its own region it can be a specific place where someone
[46:40.400 --> 46:43.400]  can source say I want to try Afghani hash.
[46:44.400 --> 46:51.400]  Are you guys growing a lot of broad leaf dominant or narrow leaf dominant varieties there?
[46:53.400 --> 47:02.400]  We grow both, there is every kind of variety available here I as you see in my Instagram
[47:02.400 --> 47:09.400]  the pictures and the effect the smell the perfume the everything the structure you can
[47:09.400 --> 47:15.400]  see every kind of plant you see in the world you can you can find in my Instagram the broad
[47:15.400 --> 47:22.400]  leaf the narrow leaf yeah the short the short plant the long plant I posted some six meter
[47:22.400 --> 47:28.400]  plants five more than five meters plants also I posted some plant at 30 some centimeter
[47:28.400 --> 47:38.400]  or less than 30 centimeter like this yeah but and also the one thing is hello yeah we
[47:38.400 --> 47:45.400]  yeah we can hear you yeah one thing is very amazing in Afghanistan you can find different
[47:45.400 --> 47:52.400]  kind of hashish in different region like Baghdashan has a different hashish, Panjshir has different
[47:52.400 --> 47:58.400]  hashish, Northern has different hashish with different smell different high different student
[47:59.400 --> 48:08.400]  yeah with completely different structure and different pattern yeah it is Afghanistan as
[48:08.400 --> 48:12.400]  I see this is that red hashish thing yourself?
[48:13.400 --> 48:20.400]  I think this site of Hindu Kush is a different place of hashish it's like the northern side
[48:20.400 --> 48:29.400]  of like Afghanistan like Badakhshan, Takhar, Kunduz, Baghlan and also Balkh like this Balkh
[48:29.400 --> 48:37.400]  is very old and according some document maybe it belongs to 10,000 years like less than
[48:37.400 --> 48:44.400]  10,000 years because the Zardushtra during the Zardushtra province of Prophet Sari maybe
[48:44.400 --> 48:50.400]  he was using they were they were the Zardushtrian he was using hashish the Balkh is the the
[48:50.400 --> 48:58.400]  place the Zardusht started invitation of their religion yeah it is some document show the
[48:58.400 --> 49:00.400]  Balkh is very old in hashish
[49:03.630 --> 49:09.630]  I'm gonna have to look at your Instagram profile these pictures that Peter is sharing are awesome
[49:10.630 --> 49:12.630]  yeah they're epic
[49:13.630 --> 49:19.630]  It's actually Afghani hash is how I first cut my teeth back in the 70s on Afghani hash when I was overseas
[49:19.630 --> 49:25.630]  and it's fine that red hash what you said Brandon that stuff is freaking awesome man it's just
[49:26.630 --> 49:32.630]  amazing that they they quite honestly think that because we smoke it in flower form that we don't
[49:32.630 --> 49:36.630]  know what we're doing because they do not smoke it in flower form it's all processed down into hash
[49:37.630 --> 49:43.630]  it's part of part of the ritual of it that where we differentiate on where I think flower in its finest
[49:43.630 --> 49:51.630]  form is that they go and turn it into a process like that and it's amazing amazing amazing
[49:52.630 --> 49:58.630]  Haroon can you tell me what varietal that hash comes from what region of the world and can you give
[49:58.630 --> 50:04.630]  us a little bit of information on that red hashish because I'm really intrigued I'd love to know a
[50:04.630 --> 50:09.630]  little bit about the history maybe the village and the people that it comes from where you know where
[50:09.630 --> 50:13.630]  it's been cultivated what are the conditions that it's cultivated in
[50:16.630 --> 50:25.630]  Sorry first short question because I can't hear and my English is not so much good short question
[50:26.630 --> 50:31.630]  like this and I explain you I couldn't understand your question sorry about
[50:32.630 --> 50:42.630]  I was just asking what region does the variety of cannabis grow in that produces the red hashish
[50:45.630 --> 50:53.630]  Yeah the red hashish the red hashish the bulk the bulk hashish is red yeah because people believe to
[50:54.630 --> 51:01.630]  how why it is red and it is oil it's a story I mean because a lot of attack during the story like
[51:01.630 --> 51:09.630]  Mughal Islam attack on the bulk province and a lot of they kill it all the residents of bulk
[51:09.630 --> 51:18.630]  even they don't leave one hand alive yeah yeah masculine yeah in bulk province two three times
[51:19.630 --> 51:26.630]  there was masculine and hashish hashish believe because the ground of bulk is so oily and so blue
[51:30.630 --> 51:40.630]  they killed a lot of people here because yeah just the belief of hashish because that the bulk hashish is red and very oily
[51:41.630 --> 51:48.630]  So does this particular variety grow in somewhere where there's really really intense sun
[51:52.930 --> 51:59.930]  Sorry does this variety grow in very very intense sun like like maybe a high altitude where there's a lot of
[52:01.930 --> 52:05.930]  ultraviolet light like maybe high on the mountains or is this a lower altitude
[52:06.930 --> 52:18.480]  Yeah bulk is in downhill of mountains it is it is it is a land it is complete between mountains and river
[52:18.480 --> 52:35.480]  it is a complete run a little sandy land and also yeah I think bulk but the all Afghanistan believe bulk is the motherland of hashish
[52:35.480 --> 52:44.480]  the all province want the bulk hashish all people is attracted to the in every hashish and attract to bulk hashish
[52:44.480 --> 52:54.480]  and also the bulk is a very agricultural land for everything yeah watermelon, pomegranate, almond
[52:55.480 --> 53:01.480]  you taste everything of hashish everything of agriculture bulk agriculture is unique yeah everything
[53:02.480 --> 53:08.480]  the reason of everything in bulk province yeah you mean the reason yeah the reason is very important in agriculture
[53:09.480 --> 53:17.480]  the reason of everything is different I tasted a lot of almond from everywhere but you can't find the taste of bulk almond in everywhere
[53:17.480 --> 53:26.480]  the watermelons also the melon also the pomegranate the figs yeah we have a lot of ferrute which you didn't taste
[53:27.480 --> 53:35.480]  because look at it is we have a melon very like it's like a honey yeah when you the reason is very strong
[53:36.480 --> 53:44.480]  that color is really typical to other plants and fruits is that what you're saying in the regions that the cannabis grows
[53:45.480 --> 53:57.480]  but I don't know exactly but just I know it is the strongest of seeds because the seed is very old here the seeds are very old
[53:58.480 --> 54:00.480]  he's saying it comes from a region
[54:00.480 --> 54:02.480]  the story is very old in that
[54:02.480 --> 54:03.480]  okay
[54:04.480 --> 54:07.480]  the agriculture is very
[54:08.480 --> 54:10.480]  yeah hello
[54:10.480 --> 54:12.480]  yeah we can hear you
[54:14.750 --> 54:15.750]  yeah
[54:17.750 --> 54:21.750]  I love that that that like my whole like
[54:23.750 --> 54:25.750]  anyway keep going
[54:25.750 --> 54:26.750]  yep
[54:26.750 --> 54:27.750]  hello
[54:29.750 --> 54:31.750]  keep going Haroon
[54:31.750 --> 54:35.750]  the soil must be amazing in the area you were talking about
[54:36.750 --> 54:46.750]  I think I don't know I could understand you or no just my English is not so good but I try to understand you
[54:47.750 --> 54:54.750]  yeah about just I talked about why the bulk ashish is very strong
[54:55.750 --> 55:05.750]  and also the another thing is the bulk ashish the season is very long
[55:06.750 --> 55:15.750]  because the bulk is not cold place when you cultivate and until you always and until you cultivate it take about eight months or seven months
[55:15.750 --> 55:22.750]  but other place it take it takes six months seven months or in some cold place
[55:22.750 --> 55:34.750]  everything I think according to some everything packed in very long temperature it become very I think good
[55:35.750 --> 55:42.750]  because I'm not professional in agriculture but I'm about more than 30 years inside in this business
[55:42.750 --> 55:51.750]  agriculture business because we had a supermarket ferret supermarket and also I was inside the ashish center of ashish in Afghanistan
[55:51.750 --> 55:53.750]  I grew it growing up I'm
[55:56.750 --> 55:57.750]  I would say
[56:02.750 --> 56:08.750]  not professionally I'm going but less professionally I'm continuing I'm writing I'm researching about this some
[56:08.750 --> 56:12.750]  Afghanistan unique product like ashish like some some unique melon like this
[56:13.750 --> 56:19.750]  yeah but Afghanistan Mazar bulk product is very unique in agriculture yeah
[56:23.540 --> 56:25.540]  and it's a long tradition right
[56:26.540 --> 56:33.540]  yeah it's a long because we have about 100 kind of almond variety about 100 kind of melon variety
[56:33.540 --> 56:39.540]  100 kind of cannabis variety 100 kind of everything we don't have one variety
[56:39.540 --> 56:46.540]  everything we have more than 100 variety more than 20-30 variety we have
[56:46.540 --> 56:51.540]  but I don't think in nowhere in the world you can
[56:53.540 --> 57:10.540]  and this yeah the plant structure quite honestly Mia is completely and Brandon both the plant structure is completely different than what we encounter here in the in the in the United States it's just a the whole bud formation and everything is
[57:11.540 --> 57:17.540]  quite honestly if you don't really do land races you don't really understand that part of it if you're if you're
[57:18.540 --> 57:33.540]  you're in the hybrid into the thing and you're dealing you know you're smoking cookies or whatever the lot of the newest they have people don't quite understand honestly what a lot of what the plant looks like and how it is processed is a completely different structured plant as well
[57:34.540 --> 57:54.540]  so I think about the cannabis plant and another thing brother that they don't do that that we would never do here you know that I would never do and you would never do is is that there's open pollination and the whole deal that's it's a part of why the the variety is so strong and it's just amazing so a lot of the land race stuff that comes from those mountain ranges
[57:55.540 --> 58:10.540]  and I get what you're asking I get what the part about what you're asking is what region does the red come from you can probably find the area you're just going to have to do a little bit more research you know could Tom and Morocco the northern mountain ranges where he was talking about up in up in our Ram
[58:11.540 --> 58:17.540]  between Iran and Afghanistan those areas you know if you can source seeds out of there that's the tricky part of the deal.
[58:18.540 --> 58:23.540]  If you can't put boots on the ground, so to speak, and do it yourself, can you find a source where you can get it.
[58:23.540 --> 58:52.540]  Yeah, because it's really interesting because typically those higher altitudes a plant will produce anthio higher anthio cyanin and but that doesn't necessarily translate to the resin head being filled up with with the color that is essentially going to give you that in your hash or your concentrate so to be able to find that consistently is pretty rare and so when people find that especially hashmakers for modern.
[58:53.540 --> 59:03.540]  stuff they're like that's something that they're going to hold on to right because they can distinguish their brand with something that's unique as just simple as a color shift.
[59:05.540 --> 59:16.540]  I believe, and you're right and i'm going to go back to my experience and i'm talking like late 70s i'm over there i've just anyway my military career as part of my break was in that area.
[59:17.540 --> 59:33.540]  that's we this red Afghani hash man, and it was 500 grand plates, you know, and they were stacked with wax and an inch thick and as big as a shoe box, you know and just load that but very, very source from just within a family, it was a family that did it, you know.
[59:34.540 --> 59:47.540]  And quite honestly, he may be able to source you down to that close to where the area came from the translation barriers, a little bit of what you're dealing with right now what you're asking I understand what you're asking you want to know what neighborhood that bad boy came out of.
[59:48.540 --> 01:00:01.540]  In the reason I asked is because I have a friend he guardian of lost herpes on ig Greg his father is a still lives in a in Russia he's Russian and his father from a village in southern Siberia.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:14.540]  And he went over and sourced a bunch of land race seeds from feral varieties right he actually went to fields that weren't cultivated that were just wild on all these different borders.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:30.540]  And so he gave me all the seeds, and they were some of the hardest seeds that I've ever had to they I mean they didn't want anything they didn't like the living soil systems that I run they wanted like they wanted dirt, they didn't want a lot of water, the seeds
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:36.540]  were hard to pop you had the freeze them, you had like there were so much maintenance.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:54.540]  So what I ended up doing is I just took one of the cuts that I knew was just hardy and going to do good the gorilla before, and I cross and I did an open pollination with a bunch of really nice males that I selected out of the varietals, and I hit the
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:01:09.540]  started playing with it and it's completely different. You get different terpene expressions the, the structures different the way that it affects you neurologically is different, it's the whole, the whole experience is completely different.
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:25.540]  So when you can source something like that. It just for me it's like, Oh dude if I could introduce that into something like one of these badass cushies that I have that just puts on that chunks up and puts on weight, and you get that effect.
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:28.540]  Then you have something that goal.
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:42.540]  I think I think it's coming to that point quite honestly I mean you know put me in the same damn room for an evening you know that whole thing it's like, you know what I mean it's like this it's how it happens and I believe that in the next 24 to 36 months we're going to see advances
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:56.540]  I take it to heart the general rule of thumb that I hear is you know the advances in the last 10 years been advanced the previous hundred years you know it's how much we've moved in, you know, now let's take the next 36 months with what's happening now.
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:09.540]  I believe we're coming to a point where we're going to be able to put craft breeders in place with the right kind of medical professionals where we can source, because we have our own Rolodex is of what's, you know, different chemo boards that we've been playing
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:25.540]  with, you know, a database where we can contact each other and you know we could come together and make stuff happen. I see it coming real real quick you know I mean, this is, this is kind of like what I'm like focusing on out here is because you can, because there's
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:41.540]  like so many people operating I'm able to show new people that come in like hey you can do an organic cultivation style biological crop steering, and you can, and you can get numbers you can do and do super good quality as well.
[01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:47.540]  And it's not it's not super difficult and it's super cost effective.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.540]  It's good.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:03:05.540]  Science can be all based off of agronomy. But here's the tricky part about all of it, right, because we're using these modified growing mixes. And we look at the science that are based off of the agronomy and we have to be able to figure out how these things
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:24.540]  work and what actually works in practice. So some of the things that will work in typical field agronomy where you don't have these modified mixes that are super super fertile, you know, and then the things that you're monitoring and these types of systems are different
[01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:52.540]  in, you know, a regular like field agronomy setting and it's like transferring the data from one set to the other is different because a lot of times when people do research, they're, they're missing some of the things they're missing the thing that the soil structure is so much different in a modified growing mix where you're talking about 35
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:04:05.540]  maybe 40% aeration. How does that, you know, that is going to equate to different biological aspects happening to the different nutrient cycling capacities, just different water retention.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:22.540]  And so it's really hard to translate the information. But once you are able to figure that all out, then you can then you can kind of like dial the system in based off still based off of the science, right? You're just being able to figure out how to translate it over.
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:43.540]  Just quickly I Haroon I'm caught. I'm I understand that you're in Afghanistan. So I want to be good with your time I wanted when you next come back on. I wanted to see if you can bring him with you. Is this one of your friends because I love him. I love watching him take the biggest rips.
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:46.540]  I was sorry, right. I can see it.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:48.540]  I want to see this man.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:53.540]  Okay, this dude, this guy right here.
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:57.540]  Can you bring him on with you one time.
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:02.540]  Next time every every time you want I will be here with him. Yeah.
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:03.540]  Yeah.
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:12.540]  And because he likes to smoke.
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:20.540]  Children.
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:21.540]  Yeah.
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:35.540]  Haroon it's so nice for you to hang out for us. Hang out with us for a bit. Can I ask just what your personal favorites recently have been what your favorite way to smoke lately is.
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:46.540]  Can I just ask what your, what your favorite way to smoke lately is like recently what your favorite stylist for smoking.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.540]  Your favorite.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:55.810]  What device do you like to do you like to use a chillum or
[01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:57.810]  chillam I always use chillam. Yeah.
[01:05:57.810 --> 01:05:59.810]  Yeah, not join.
[01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:02.810]  Yes, I always use chillam.
[01:06:02.810 --> 01:06:07.080]  You can taste it properly.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:12.080]  I love the is very good because it's a lot.
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:24.080]  If you if you smoke in chillam, you don't smoke and not like like a bong or like an Indian chillam like a joint yeah you never smoke because chillam is something for a special for cannabis smoking.
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:39.480]  It is the smoke very soft, very enjoyable with a lot of smell, everything you taste in chillam, you can in Afghanistan.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:43.480]  Awesome I feel like I need one now.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:51.480]  We need to come visit after Coronavirus will schedule the Afghan tour.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:07:00.480]  The entire chat will come we'll have like a 300 person plane heading over.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.480]  Oh, when.
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.480]  After Coronavirus.
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:11.480]  Yeah, you will come every time you want. I will host you.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:18.480]  What, yeah I don't know what's going on with the remove spotlight.
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:21.480]  Oh hi.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:33.480]  And now it's on me. I guess I can tell us the way I already smoked all the blue skunk though, or not all of it but just the what the stuff I had packed here hold on I'm having all sorts of.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:36.480]  All right.
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.480]  What's the cross on it.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:42.480]  I might want my video.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:48.480]  Santa Cruz blue dream brother.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:58.480]  Cross with one of my old, old double indica from the 80s that I've been playing with for years and years.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:03.220]  Okay.
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:09.220]  This is just what yeah yeah we have on him.
[01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:14.220]  This is what the American kids are smoking.
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:19.220]  These crazy newfangled contraptions.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:27.220]  Yeah, I like the juxtaposition between like what you're doing and those videos of that guy.
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:44.220]  All right, her and what will let you go but I this is so for everybody watching that this was our test to see if we could connect with him in Afghanistan, we will work to improve it but we appreciate your time, and we'll get you on.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:48.220]  We live from Afghanistan spotlight.
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.220]  Thank you. Okay.
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.220]  Thank you so much.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:58.220]  I'm definitely gonna your ID.
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.220]  What a treat.
[01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:10.220]  The his IG is that correct is add to be a be a 879 Is that right. Yes. Cool.
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:17.220]  I'm going to paste it in the chat.
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:27.220]  BAA BA 879. Yeah, I've been talking to him forever about doing stuff and.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:37.220]  And so I'm psyched that like he actually had a bunch of he had like his like chillin set up ready to go to smoke out with us and obviously the video.
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:44.220]  But if we can nail the video like he was in front of a bunch of plants in the background.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:51.220]  And I want to see that guy from that video.
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:56.220]  You're a, you have an IG Doc Ray or no.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:58.220]  Yeah, I do have an Instagram to.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:01.220]  He does.
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:04.220]  Yeah, can you can you just shoot that to me.
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:05.220]  Peter.
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:07.220]  Yeah.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:23.220]  Yeah, you may have to remind me later tonight or tomorrow but this is for everybody watching. Let me, I don't know why I keep a place but so this is Doc's Instagram.
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:30.220]  Before Mia went back to her dad rig she did try the blue skunk.
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:34.220]  Okay, I got it.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:40.390]  And what it.
[01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:45.390]  And what do you think I am enjoying the blue skunk right now.
[01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:48.390]  Um, I feel like strong.
[01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:57.390]  I just took a big dab after, but that was just to fill out the corners.
[01:10:57.390 --> 01:11:05.390]  I really like it. It is very mellow for me. It's like, and I feel like it.
[01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:10.390]  I'm sorry this is when stoner starts sounding like wine, wine people but.
[01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:23.390]  But basically it felt like it felt very mellow, but it also was a very slow moving effect where it like dawned on me slowly from within rather than hitting me like a train.
[01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:30.390]  So, yeah, quite a treat but I can see what you mean about the grounding, the grounding thing.
[01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:48.390]  That's what I've been told me, you know, it's not necessarily my choice of words but again someone that I have very much a lot of respect her, her partner was what he said to me, you know, in conversation is just like you know that's a great way to put it.
[01:11:48.390 --> 01:12:17.390]  And again I'm just going back for what this is just, it's old man weed you know if I'm going to be that blunt about it it was my, it's my daily smoker you want to call it private reserve that's what it was, or what it is, you know, I get the same response you know for the last two plus years sister I've had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of veteran men and women that branch from me being, you know, a 70s era vet.
[01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:33.390]  To young brothers and sisters that are just gotten out like when I was over in Sacramento right before COVID started you know just got out a couple of days before you know that we were there, they're looking for the same thing I was looking for.
[01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:53.390]  And I love seeing you do this and Peter what Peter does and Brandon I don't know you yet brother but I'll find out about you over the next few days to you know let's hope you're doing well and I'm just going to keep you in the loop.
[01:12:53.390 --> 01:13:13.390]  And I love seeing you do this and Peter what Peter does and Brandon I don't know you yet brother but I'll find out about you over the next few days to you know let's hope you're doing well and I'm just going to keep you in the loop.
[01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:41.390]  I'm just going to keep you in the loop.
[01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:53.390]  And I love seeing you do this and Peter what Peter does and Brandon I don't know you yet brother but I'll find out about you over the next few days to you know let's hope you're doing well and I'm just going to keep you in the loop.
[01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:59.150]  it was called Old Dave man back in the 70s. That's what it was called. You know, I called it the
[01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:07.070]  Mendocino Peace Plant up before 92. You got your buddies over in Tahoe called the Tahoe Kush man,
[01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:11.470]  you got you know, it all it's a name. It's like what they do now. You know, it's a cookie
[01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:18.190]  something what the hell man. You know, again, I where you're at, I want to be able to follow that
[01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:23.070]  part of it where we can follow the lineage and and why I send paperwork with stuff when I send
[01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:26.270]  it out so people can see what the heck they're getting when they have it, you know, with my
[01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:31.390]  samples per se. You know, I'm assuming well, again, the people that I'm aligning with sister
[01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:34.990]  that are doing my distribution, that's how they roll. You know, that's how they function. And
[01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:39.950]  all reason why I'm even letting it go out to hopefully let it go out to the masses and get
[01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:45.150]  it up to scale. We can find committed growers that will grow it at a certain level of quality.
[01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:50.990]  You know, I'm a holistic wildcraft organic, you know, and people call it a lot of different things
[01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:57.630]  just the way I personally function, you know, I, it's just how my practices and how I've lived for
[01:14:57.630 --> 01:15:03.150]  the last my whole, well, my whole life and how I've lived, you know, so and Brandon, and you too,
[01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:06.350]  you know, the way you live sister and the same thing, Brandon, the way you live, brother, you
[01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:13.310]  know, how we practice what we do day in and day out. And that's part of this right now. You know,
[01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:18.510]  that's really part of what this is. My goal. Well, and another part of it, too, you know,
[01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:22.750]  it's like the plants that I'm working with, all my plants are designed to be bred by mom and pops,
[01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:27.950]  you know, that work well in a three to five gallon container on your backyard in a medium of your
[01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:34.030]  choice, be it soil or soilless, living or not. And you can get a nice shield off of this of a
[01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:38.350]  quality flower that you can grow your own. I'm real big proponent of growing your own,
[01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:43.710]  grow your own everything, man, you know, what I practice, you know, what I hope you practice too.
[01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:50.590]  But on the flower specifically, it's great for taking the edge off of a really bad day. If you're
[01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:55.310]  having anxiety, if you're if you're suffering from PTSD, or you have post traumatic stress,
[01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:58.750]  I try to leave the disorder part of it out, because I don't believe that's the correct
[01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:04.350]  phraseology. But if you suffer from post traumatic stress, and have physical damages, this is a really,
[01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:09.230]  really good flower for that. And it addresses those issues, you know, like I'll say to you
[01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:17.550]  guys now, does your back hurt? You know, what's really interesting is, when I first came out here,
[01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:24.110]  I was I was sitting, I was sitting at a bar, I was meeting up with somebody, another business
[01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:32.030]  associate at the time. And somebody that was sitting next to us overheard us talking about
[01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:39.390]  cannabis. And he's like, Hey, you I was like, I don't mean to interrupt. And he was, you know, he,
[01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:48.190]  we started talking. And his whole thing was that a lot of the stuff was too strong. Right? And, and
[01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:54.030]  um, I remember when I first started smoking, we actually was just smoking Mexican weed,
[01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:57.150]  you know, one, because that's all I could afford. And there wasn't a whole lot of like,
[01:16:57.870 --> 01:17:05.630]  you know, there wasn't a large availability of well, that's all there was to the best you could
[01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:11.390]  get for like, was like, sometimes you come up on my pretendies, right? The pretend because we used
[01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:25.070]  to call him it was just better. It was just better. So, you know, um, but I totally lost my train of
[01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:32.990]  thought. I just think that like, some of the stuff too, is is, is too strong. And, and, and,
[01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:41.150]  and I remember there was a time when I first started smoking. And I can imagine, like,
[01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:50.190]  if the first time I smoked weed, I was getting something that was like, you know, 25 or 30% THC,
[01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:56.110]  that would be like crazy to me, because I was like hallucinating off weed that was probably a
[01:17:56.110 --> 01:18:04.030]  best maybe 5%. You know, I mean, it might have just been my own body chemistry. But you know,
[01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:09.070]  part of the good about that I was new at one point. And I think that sometimes people want
[01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:15.390]  to have the effect of the cannabis that that they're going to get from the entourage effect
[01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:21.550]  and all the and all the herpes and all the other things that are aren't classified as medicinal
[01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:28.750]  that are in that plant as well. And then maybe just lower levels of those those really psychoactive
[01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:35.150]  cannabinoids, you know, because it can be too much for for people who are beginning and as I
[01:18:35.150 --> 01:18:40.910]  think sometimes, for a lot of people who have been in cannabis, myself included, I forget about
[01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:46.110]  people that are just coming into this because we're smoking dabs all the time. And so I think
[01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:52.670]  that making making that available at something that's low, but really good quality, with a really
[01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:59.790]  complete profile is something that that the market, I think it has a demand for.
[01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:05.710]  It's a it's a tough switch, though, Brandon, right now, what we're at least what I found in the last
[01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:11.470]  two years coming out of sheer obscurity. And really, I've been doing this for a long time,
[01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:16.910]  Peter knows my backstory, I'm not going to go too far into it. But you know, you young brothers and
[01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:22.510]  sisters have been in the craft for a while, like from 2004, where the old school part of us that
[01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:28.190]  kind of stepped out of his new group moved in, and have moved forward, what we've seen the advances
[01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:34.910]  is basically 2000, you know, that time period where we've seen a shift of commercialism of the
[01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:41.150]  plant, a lack of follow through of the old school craft things that we used to carry tried and true
[01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:46.510]  through that part of what the craft heritage part that's coming back slowly back now. You know,
[01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:51.230]  that's the that's what where the shift needs to be, you know, we need to pass that information
[01:19:51.230 --> 01:19:56.750]  across. And I also believe that we need to be working on the, there's that divide, you know,
[01:19:56.750 --> 01:20:03.710]  I've been told, we have a market is basically driven by dollar per gram, and how high it will
[01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:08.350]  get me when it comes to the recreational market. And that's not the market that I really craft
[01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:13.710]  myself towards, you know, I craft myself towards the medicinal market that unders that wants to
[01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:20.270]  understand full spectrum and what it really means. And, and I get what you're saying. And you are
[01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:24.750]  really it is true. But again, like my razzleberry, man, you know, it's a true one to one, it runs
[01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:31.150]  about 15 to 18%. And I guarantee you, you think 30% THC is where that you'll be asleep in 20 minutes
[01:20:31.150 --> 01:20:38.110]  on a 15% THC plant, man, why because it's got 15% CBD in it as well. And your butt's going to take
[01:20:38.110 --> 01:20:44.750]  a nap. I promise. I don't care if you think you are I've had too many big friends of mine. Let
[01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:50.830]  me smoke that old guy. Jump off in there, big boy, tell to me four hours after you wake back up. And
[01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:55.390]  that's what happens. But that's what it's designed to do. It's designed for people that are in
[01:20:55.390 --> 01:21:00.830]  excruciating pain that want to take a nap. There is a point or you can't sleep and you want to go
[01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:06.110]  to sleep, you know, if you get insomnia, whatever it is, there's a market for that. But it doesn't
[01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:11.310]  really translate well into the commercial market now because of exactly what you said, because it's
[01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:18.910]  a 15% plant. You know, it's not up at that 2520 even my my blue skunk, you know, it's just a smidge
[01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:25.150]  under 20. You know, the full cannabinoid structure is about 23. If you look at the paperwork, you
[01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:29.070]  don't have the paperwork in front of you, but Peter can do it. Just cover up my address, brother.
[01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:39.790]  That's all I ask. Yeah. I actually take a picture of it. But yeah, give me a minute to do some
[01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:48.510]  some graphical wizardry. Brandon, I'm sure we're going to talk about it on Thursday, but I want to
[01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:57.070]  talk about your vision for breeding and pheno hunting next year. Oh, because you want to go big,
[01:21:57.070 --> 01:22:04.830]  right? Dude, I want to go bigger. I want to go record books big. We don't you want to talk
[01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:11.150]  Breeder Steve's program. Look at the only thing the only thing that's going to limit my ability
[01:22:11.150 --> 01:22:19.230]  to do it is. My if I'm going to be able to buy enough dirt and pots, and if that's going to be,
[01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:23.150]  that's going to be it, because I'm going to do I really want to do at least 10000,
[01:22:23.710 --> 01:22:32.590]  but I really, really want to do like 15. I think that would be like the sweetest thing ever.
[01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:40.350]  And I could do I could literally dump like my whole entire seed bank, all the stuff that I've
[01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:47.870]  made, I could dump all the stuff that I've been given by the cannabis community. I can like I
[01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:54.590]  like the potential is. Fifteen thousand plants, it's going to take a lot of money, right, though,
[01:22:54.590 --> 01:23:00.670]  because I'm going to want to use a good quality soil that has good soil structure, which means
[01:23:00.670 --> 01:23:04.830]  I'm going to have to I'm going to have to build it and then I'm going to have to build probably at
[01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:12.510]  least at least a minimum 200 gallon, you know, fabric pots for each one. I'm going to have to
[01:23:12.510 --> 01:23:20.990]  set up lines just for to run my water and my amino acids and, you know, my or, you know,
[01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:26.910]  so I can do all my little top dresses and all that stuff. And and then I'm going to have to
[01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:33.230]  expenses to from the sex testing. Right. Because as soon as I pop seeds, I'm going to have to as
[01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:38.830]  soon as I have an available, you know, tissue sample, I want to get that tested so I don't
[01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:47.150]  have to mess with any of the males. Right. And I can just phenol hunt just 15000 female plants.
[01:23:47.710 --> 01:23:54.990]  I mean, that would be fucking epic. And how much do you think that would cost?
[01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:57.630]  So basically, it's a financing issue right now, right?
[01:23:59.390 --> 01:24:02.670]  Well, I don't know. We'll see how much money I have in the spring, dude. I've been
[01:24:03.630 --> 01:24:10.350]  my fucking ass off, dude. I mean, I'm just doing it where you are, brother.
[01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:16.350]  I'm doing everything I can. He is he's in Oklahoma, Oklahoma.
[01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:23.470]  The wild west, you guys have actually you guys have embraced the plant very well, brother. When
[01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:29.230]  I was when I was your age, man, they tried to throw me under the jail cell in your state. But
[01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:33.390]  you guys have your state's embrace the plant very well. It's great to see how much stride you've made
[01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:40.270]  in a decade. I'm from California. I'm from San Diego. And I fucking did two prison terms in
[01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:45.870]  fucking San Diego for this shit. And I was like, soon as I had an opportunity come into the legal
[01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:50.910]  market in Oklahoma, I hopped on it. I was like, dude, I'm there. Yeah. And then I was like, dude,
[01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:56.670]  am I even allowed to do this? And it turns out that Oklahoma is a right to work state. And I
[01:24:56.670 --> 01:25:02.350]  didn't even know that was like a thing. And it's like, yeah. So if you have a conviction,
[01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:11.310]  it's two years from when you're convicted. So if you do time, that time counts, you know,
[01:25:11.310 --> 01:25:15.390]  so you get out two years later or something like that, you're cleared to go. You can go get like a
[01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:20.750]  job. It doesn't they don't even ask on as far as I know. I don't think they even
[01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:24.190]  ask like if you're a felon or anything like that out here.
[01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:29.070]  But, you know, I haven't applied for regular jobs since I've been out here. So I couldn't
[01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:39.150]  don't quote me on that. So just quickly, I think a lot of people in like the judging a book by its
[01:25:39.150 --> 01:25:46.510]  cover have certain impressions of Oklahoma. And on the cannabis front, it's like the most amazing
[01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:50.510]  place ever. So like what what's it what's the Oklahoma scene like?
[01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:58.910]  Okay, so it's there's been like an underground scene, you know, like in all places. So the
[01:25:58.910 --> 01:26:04.430]  people that got in got in real quick, and they're doing really well. But there's again, it's there's
[01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:12.910]  like, Oklahoma, I can't speak from like a personal experience as far as the past, I can speak from
[01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:18.190]  the last year that I've been here, I see that there's a huge community.
[01:26:20.670 --> 01:26:28.350]  And that's a huge thing, right? Because the way Oklahoma set out, there's like Tulsa and Oklahoma.
[01:26:29.230 --> 01:26:35.470]  And that's pretty much like the major populated areas of the state and states not super huge.
[01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:44.270]  So it's very community oriented. The and it's almost like the people have
[01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:49.950]  said, Hey, this is what we want. And then the lawyers like this is what you guys are gonna get,
[01:26:49.950 --> 01:26:54.190]  because the lawyers are here to like help the people from what from everything that I've seen.
[01:26:54.830 --> 01:27:02.590]  You know, it's obviously there's always hiccups because it's so new. And, you know, they're just
[01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:11.070]  trying to figure things out. But it's a it's a really good place. Because they're not overtaxing
[01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:18.750]  it. And they're not over charging for licensing, and you can vertically integrate. So you can
[01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:25.630]  create a business model, a complete business model from floor to the ceiling, just like you would do
[01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:31.310]  in the traditional market, like I did, before I got, you know, before I got here.
[01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:39.230]  And it's like, dude, you cannot have to look over your back and be like, you know, it's just there.
[01:27:39.230 --> 01:27:45.550]  It's so much. So it's just a relief. I'm so happy to be here. I'm so happy that the people of
[01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:53.630]  Oklahoma have been so welcoming for me to be here. Like I feel really, really privileged. And so
[01:27:53.630 --> 01:27:59.230]  that's why I try to do as much community stuff, even if it's just doing education when I can,
[01:27:59.230 --> 01:28:04.030]  you know, because I'm so busy and I and I want to do better like production videos. But,
[01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:09.390]  you know, Peter, you've had me on the shows and I try to do what I can to help help people out,
[01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:16.750]  you know, and. And I appreciate that. I love it out here, dude. I really do. I mean, I love
[01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:23.790]  California born and raised. But, you know, as far as the laws and legislation goes, it's a shit show,
[01:28:23.790 --> 01:28:29.470]  man. I have a lot of I have a lot of friends that deserve this absolutely fucking deserve
[01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:36.910]  to be in this business. Right. And then not looking over the shoulder, you know, all my homies that
[01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:42.990]  told me, you know, and taught me, took me under their wing and said, this is how you can do this,
[01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:51.230]  kid. You know, a lot of those dudes are still hustling their ass off, you know, and it's like
[01:28:52.190 --> 01:28:59.790]  I and it's it sucks, dude. You know, because I want to see all my homies succeed, I want to
[01:28:59.790 --> 01:29:08.590]  see everybody succeed, but it's like but greed, corporate greed and shit ass legislation just
[01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:15.150]  fucks everything up for everybody because cannabis is big enough that there can be enough consumers
[01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:21.630]  and producers and processors and there's so many different markets and niches that people can be a
[01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:26.670]  part of. There's different consumer levels. There's low markets. There's mid markets. There's
[01:29:26.670 --> 01:29:31.950]  high markets. There's exotics like there's room for everybody. And if everybody could just like
[01:29:32.830 --> 01:29:38.830]  like share, you know, and not be gatekeepers of knowledge and not not and not just, you know,
[01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:44.430]  I don't know, dude, for real. I'm going on, but I get passionate about this shit because I did
[01:29:45.150 --> 01:29:51.630]  I spent time, you know, in fucking prison and I fucking love this shit. You know, this is my shit.
[01:29:52.910 --> 01:30:00.590]  Yeah, absolutely. I think what you say about California is all too true when it comes to
[01:30:01.150 --> 01:30:05.710]  the different the sort of like boom and bust cycle that you get in the mainstream with brands
[01:30:05.710 --> 01:30:12.350]  that come and go and there's all this funding and then none and it's kind of a mess. I feel like
[01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:20.030]  California has two really unique qualities and one is Hollywood, the media marketing engine,
[01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:27.390]  LA, basically. And then the other is Doc, where you are and not the other. And the Emerald Triangle
[01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:35.550]  and the heritage of North. But in terms of like sophisticated infrastructure and legislature and
[01:30:36.190 --> 01:30:42.110]  community building options, I feel like California doesn't have the sophistication or at least the
[01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:47.310]  support system that other states are building, perhaps because they've been observing the
[01:30:47.310 --> 01:30:52.190]  examples of those that have gone before. California is a disaster.
[01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:59.230]  But it's also easy to become complacent, though, and that's a problem. Like if you don't actively
[01:30:59.230 --> 01:31:08.190]  get involved, well, then, you know, you're stuck with what you get. So I I'm super busy out here
[01:31:08.190 --> 01:31:15.150]  and I and it's hard and, you know, I wish I could do more. I want to do more. And I shouldn't even
[01:31:15.150 --> 01:31:22.030]  say that because those are terrible things. I I need to allocate more time to doing this and I
[01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:29.950]  will focus on that in the future. I have some things that are going on right now that I need
[01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:36.670]  to focus more on so that way I can secure the things that I need to do so I can be able to do
[01:31:36.670 --> 01:31:46.910]  that. I guess that's how I should word that. Yeah, so Christian, who is on talking about
[01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:55.870]  all the raids in El Dorado County, is actually in jail right now. And I talked to his girlfriend
[01:31:55.870 --> 01:32:02.830]  earlier today to see what the status of the situation is. But I mean, that gets to your
[01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:10.350]  point of like 2020 California. Someone's in prison in El Dorado County for growing weed.
[01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:17.870]  OK, let me just take a minute right here. I've been to prison twice in California in it. And
[01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:22.830]  the fucking justice system is a fucking shit show. But it's not just the justice system.
[01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:29.310]  It's the whole economic principle that it's built upon. All right. Because we have institutionalized
[01:32:30.030 --> 01:32:35.710]  labor that run these things that produce all types of products that get recirculated into the system
[01:32:35.710 --> 01:32:43.710]  and into the public. OK, I was in I was the head of the commissary. Well, because check this out.
[01:32:43.710 --> 01:32:48.670]  The state of California, first of all, said straight up prison systems are full. We are not
[01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:54.110]  taking nonviolent offenders. We're not taking petty criminals. We're only taking violent offenders
[01:32:54.110 --> 01:33:02.030]  and and sex offenders. That's why most of the prisons in California are all special NYS yards
[01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:07.470]  or special needs yards. Right. Is because they're only housing those types of inmates. But what
[01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:12.590]  happened was the sheriff's department and the state of California passed this bill where you
[01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:20.750]  can go and do a state what's called a state local term. So you have to serve a prison term in in
[01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:27.230]  county jail where you don't get any fucking state amenities at all. And I fucking got fucking
[01:33:27.230 --> 01:33:33.950]  sucker punched with one of these motherfucking deals on a fucking plea bargain that I fucking
[01:33:35.150 --> 01:33:39.310]  did. And they said because I thought I was going to go to prison. I was like, fuck it, dude. At
[01:33:39.310 --> 01:33:43.710]  least, you know, I have contact visits, blah, blah, blah. I can get fucking because, you know,
[01:33:43.710 --> 01:33:47.950]  it was like, whatever. I've done it before. I'll fucking do it again. They stuck me in fucking
[01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:53.630]  county jail for 18 fucking months. Dude, I was in there with dudes that were in there for five
[01:33:53.630 --> 01:34:00.350]  and a half years already. And I did a motherfucking year with that dude before he got out. It was
[01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:06.030]  it's crazy. You can spend up to 10 years in county jail. And that means like if you're in San Diego,
[01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:11.950]  no contact visits. Dude, you're paying like a dollar for a top ramen soup. Like and it's crazy
[01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:20.270]  because they have the they have the ability to logistically incarcerate everybody and figure out
[01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:28.030]  the best way to financially, you know, gain so they can it's a whole economic system is built on
[01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:36.910]  their for profit. It's all right. It's building up the institution of incarceration so they can
[01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:42.430]  just find more officers so they get more people in there for petty crime. Yeah, it's for profit.
[01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:49.230]  That's all it's about. People get stuck in that in that loop, dude, the recidivism rate for these
[01:34:49.230 --> 01:34:55.310]  fucking prison prisons are insane. They're insane because they take away all the fucking programs
[01:34:55.870 --> 01:35:01.470]  because they're fucking the state is the last time I checked when I was locked up, it was like
[01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:06.030]  seventy five thousand five hundred sixty three dollars per inmate per year. The state was
[01:35:06.030 --> 01:35:10.670]  allocating the sheriff's department was doing something like twenty three thousand five hundred
[01:35:10.670 --> 01:35:15.550]  dollars per inmate per year to house them. So they're profiting for every inmate that they have
[01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:21.230]  for every year filling up one of those beds. They're making 50 G's plus all the money that
[01:35:21.230 --> 01:35:28.270]  they're getting off the fucking free labor all to fucking run the jails, run the laundry facilities,
[01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:34.510]  run the the fucking huge food kitchens, run the commissaries, run the laundries and do all the
[01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:40.190]  outside grounds works on on fucking parks and shit, dude. So it's like it's a whole system
[01:35:40.190 --> 01:35:46.830]  that's built into economic gain. Right. And if that shit isn't in place, parks don't get serviced.
[01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:52.110]  Right. Fires don't get put out. Right. Because you got motherfucking dudes that are like, I want to
[01:35:52.110 --> 01:35:56.510]  get the fuck out of here. I'll go to fire camp and volunteer so I can get thirty three percent
[01:35:56.510 --> 01:36:02.510]  instead of spending, you know, fifty five, fifty or fucking whatever, how much percent they agree to
[01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:09.470]  spend. And then motherfuckers die on jobs and you don't fucking hear about that in the in the news
[01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:15.230]  when a dude cuts his leg open with a fucking chainsaw, cuts his artery open or a fucking tree
[01:36:15.230 --> 01:36:25.550]  falls on homeboy. You know what I mean? It's like. The system is messed up. It's no mistake that when
[01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:31.230]  slavery was outlawed, there was a provision saying except for in the case of incarcerated people.
[01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:37.070]  And I think in the I think in California, on the West Coast especially, we have to pay attention
[01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:43.870]  to the way incarcerated firefighters are treated because we owe them our lives and also our
[01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:49.470]  property, which is something that capitalism should care about. I was reading about a case
[01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:56.750]  in the Guardian of a of an incarcerated firefighter in California who served out his
[01:36:56.750 --> 01:37:02.750]  term and then was deported or and his sister was like waiting for him on the day and everything.
[01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:09.390]  I just guess that's one of the best things, too, that they do. Right. So in San Diego, you have a
[01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:15.550]  huge Hispanic population. Right. And a lot of those are what are called Pisces. Right. The Pisces
[01:37:16.190 --> 01:37:22.670]  are Mexican immigrants and they're usually just they're usually just dudes that are,
[01:37:23.310 --> 01:37:28.510]  you know, running your fire like everyone else. Right. They don't. What they do is they'll
[01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:34.910]  house them, they'll get funding and they'll have them work and then they deport them and then they
[01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:40.110]  come back and they just keep that system perpetuated to like most of the work camps.
[01:37:40.590 --> 01:37:47.390]  That's how they're it's fucking racist as fuck, too. I mean, but the racist but it's
[01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:54.110]  it racist on both ends, dude. It's racist from we it's like you have to be racist in there. You
[01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:58.750]  got to stick with your race because if you don't, you can get fucked up, dude. Like if something
[01:37:58.750 --> 01:38:04.990]  pops off in a in in a California prison and you don't roll with your race, you're going to get
[01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:09.790]  fucked up. Bottom fucking line. So it's like you better roll with your fucking people. Right.
[01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:14.910]  And people check their paperwork to make sure you're not like a child molester or you're not
[01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:19.950]  a fucking you know, you didn't beat up somebody's grandma or you didn't do some fucked up shit.
[01:38:19.950 --> 01:38:25.710]  Right. Because those people should not be in general population. Right. That's the mentality
[01:38:25.710 --> 01:38:32.830]  right that you get. So you have this this mentality on both sides. You know, I've been there and I see
[01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:40.670]  I've seen how it works. You know, it's a psychological division that's necessary for
[01:38:40.670 --> 01:38:48.510]  the the system to work and to be able to even begin to break the cycle is you have to break
[01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:52.190]  that psychological chain. And it's not going to happen because you're giving people that are
[01:38:52.190 --> 01:38:56.030]  psychologically broken power over other people that are psychologically broken.
[01:38:56.830 --> 01:39:03.470]  Well, it's also it's crazy what you say about like it being so the antagonism being so based
[01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:10.590]  on ethnicity. That sounds like the kind of toxic environment that those that are profiting from it
[01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:18.670]  would encourage because then you're not focusing on them and focusing on on that's like that sounds
[01:39:18.670 --> 01:39:23.790]  that sounds so toxic and reform is needed. But I did see that the governor of California did
[01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:27.470]  sign some new thing into law to do with incarcerated firefighters. I didn't read
[01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:33.390]  all the details, though, but it looked like progress. And it's so one of the big things,
[01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:42.670]  right. What they realized this year is because of the covid, whatever, whatever that is, I still I
[01:39:42.670 --> 01:39:51.950]  don't know. But what happened was they did a bunch of releases for people that were incarcerated like
[01:39:52.510 --> 01:39:57.870]  they rightly should, because those fucking places are a disease factory to begin with. And people
[01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:04.590]  shouldn't be spending prison terms or any time incarcerated in these types of facilities that
[01:40:04.590 --> 01:40:10.590]  are just they're they're insane. They're absolutely. Yeah, I was reading these back.
[01:40:10.590 --> 01:40:16.030]  Right. What happened is they sent all these firefighters home, all these hot shot crews
[01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:24.830]  that run that are all up and down the whole entire state of California. And then what happened?
[01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:30.110]  Fires broke out and they were short. They didn't have people to man lines. They didn't have those
[01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:37.790]  hot shot inmate fire crews. And then people were like, oh, shit. Like and then and then it was only
[01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:45.710]  then that the subject was even brought up, you know, because they're like, oh, shit, we we don't
[01:40:45.710 --> 01:40:54.430]  have like the the necessary requirements to to like fight these fires, you know, and it's like,
[01:40:54.430 --> 01:41:00.110]  well, OK, well, guess what? It's because you guys have been profiting off of fucking people who,
[01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:06.990]  you know, people you know, the people that go to fire camp, nonviolent, usually just drug offenders,
[01:41:07.950 --> 01:41:13.390]  low level, level one, level two inmates that are just trying to get back to their families as fast
[01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:18.510]  as possible. That might have fucked up, dude, you know, and like said, put their lives on the line.
[01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:23.870]  And then when they get out, they weren't able to get jobs. So hopefully that bill helps these
[01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:34.910]  these men and women, you know, get jobs. And, you know, dude, if you serve your time and you pay
[01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:41.950]  your fucking debt plus some, I mean, it's I think it's fucked up that society would take a shit on
[01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:50.270]  when you get out. I mean, I appreciate your passion and your and your it's obvious that
[01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:55.390]  you're passionate about it and it pisses you off and it pisses me off. But guys, this is something
[01:41:55.390 --> 01:42:01.470]  that's going back since, you know, before you guys were born and I was a little boy and it's like,
[01:42:01.470 --> 01:42:06.590]  this is nothing's changed. We haven't really nothing's really switched. You know, it's the same.
[01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:12.430]  It's FUBAR just a different day, man. You know, that's just sadly what it boils down to. It's
[01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:17.150]  gotten worse. I'm broken hearted. We were supposed to be leaving the car. I thought we were supposed
[01:42:17.150 --> 01:42:22.750]  to leave the world better off for the generations as we went out. Something shifted between me and
[01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:29.550]  you guys. You know, I know the generation that's above me 10 years of screwing shit up right now.
[01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:34.270]  That's part of the problem. They need to go away. I don't know. And I don't know how quite honestly
[01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:39.550]  how you fix it. How do you dismantle something that's been ingrained for 300 years? You know,
[01:42:40.190 --> 01:42:48.110]  well, I I feel like the people I'm feeling are young people today, Gen Z. I feel like part of
[01:42:48.110 --> 01:42:54.590]  how you dismantle it is just empower them. They care about the environment. And I feel like they
[01:42:54.590 --> 01:43:02.990]  don't have a lot of the same baggage that that other generations do. It's really it's sad. You
[01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:06.990]  know, it's like and I and I appreciate it, Brandon. I'm glad to see I'm glad to see your
[01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:12.510]  passion about it. You know, I sat on the top of a mountain for 40 years and screamed, you know,
[01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:16.910]  after I got out, you know, again, over three quarters of an ounce of the sacred plant, man.
[01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:22.190]  It's a misdemeanor or non ticketable offense in 33 states now. It's like it's ridiculous. It was
[01:43:22.190 --> 01:43:27.150]  just timing. You know, it was and as you said, and I understand what you're talking about,
[01:43:27.150 --> 01:43:32.110]  non level first offense, non violent offenders, man. That's what I was. I was also after my
[01:43:32.110 --> 01:43:37.310]  military career, too. You know, it's like it's just how it's nothing again. Nothing has changed
[01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:42.910]  between me and you. You know, nothing switches like that. How do you fix it? I don't know. How
[01:43:42.910 --> 01:43:49.070]  do you change the same thing? You know, there was I've been locked up with with Vietnam vets that
[01:43:49.630 --> 01:43:54.350]  that got hooked on heroin after the war, and they've been going to jail and prison since
[01:43:54.350 --> 01:44:00.910]  I've been locked up with dudes that been in current wars. With the same exact thing happened,
[01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:06.590]  you know what I mean? It's like it's it's inherently how you lock up somebody that's
[01:44:06.590 --> 01:44:10.590]  going to go like risk your life. I mean, we both I mean, we know it. You know, the prison system
[01:44:10.590 --> 01:44:16.110]  inherently is is disproportionately there's a lot of veterans in the prison system or homeless. You
[01:44:16.110 --> 01:44:19.950]  know, that's a lot of the problem with our country right now is we don't take care of our homes.
[01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:27.310]  Yeah, and I hate I don't want to make this a downer conversation. That's not the I don't
[01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:34.510]  think all the conversation. But yeah, there's inherently something wrong and nothing's really
[01:44:34.510 --> 01:44:38.590]  changed. I actually said that the other day. It's like stuff that I was as a young man watching in
[01:44:38.590 --> 01:44:43.630]  the 60s. You know, this, this current civil rights thing that every the Black Lives Matter and all
[01:44:43.630 --> 01:44:47.790]  this other thing is civil unrest that we're seeing in the country. The same thing when I was a young
[01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:53.070]  man in the 60s is what's happening right now. It's again, that's 50 years or however far that is 60
[01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:58.110]  years later, nothing's really nothing's really shifted. You know, it's like, how do we get beyond
[01:44:58.110 --> 01:45:04.270]  this? Where does the change come? And it's sadly what I see is, and I get it. I don't understand
[01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:08.750]  it. But I do get what happens is corruption and the power they get in the position. They've been
[01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:13.470]  there for 30 years. They got money coming in from backdoor access. They've got access.
[01:45:13.470 --> 01:45:20.590]  You don't want to relinquish an inch. Yeah, it's the corruption. Why there should be term limits.
[01:45:20.670 --> 01:45:24.350]  I believe there should be term limits in all political offices. I think that's those positions
[01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:32.110]  like in positions of authority, like heads of police departments. Yeah, it's the same groups,
[01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:36.590]  you know, or you get into small communities, man. It's like one family controls. It's just like
[01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:41.790]  the cannabis community, right? Then the law enforcement community and it's like the, the,
[01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:47.070]  the group over here like, oh, these are the major players. Oh, you know, it's the same thing,
[01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:53.550]  dude. It's like all that. If you're into, if you're into cooking and you're like a top tier
[01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:58.670]  chef and you have your niche of people, it's the same thing wherever it is. It's, it's,
[01:45:59.310 --> 01:46:03.230]  it translates over and it's just like any of those things could possibly be.
[01:46:03.230 --> 01:46:08.830]  This, this plant particularly translates across all of them. You know, that's the coolest thing.
[01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:14.510]  This conversation, the great unifier, man, the great unifier, this, the sacred plan is the great
[01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:18.670]  unifier. You know, it's like, how do we, how do I, maybe that's how we bring everybody together.
[01:46:18.670 --> 01:46:25.310]  Cause I realized the crazy part of that's like my, my capitalist, my rich capitalist,
[01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:31.070]  Republican friends, you know, they're the ones who can afford $5,000 a pound cannabis. You know,
[01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:37.230]  it's not, you're like, I love those guys. They buy my weed for top dollar.
[01:46:38.190 --> 01:46:43.470]  You won't have to remember a lot of these people worked really, really hard to get where they are.
[01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:48.990]  And, you know, and they don't like, so when people become really successful and they come from
[01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:53.630]  nothing, they don't want all their shit taken away from them. You know what I mean? It's just as bad.
[01:46:55.790 --> 01:46:59.710]  Everything they have. They also don't want anyone to take it away from them either.
[01:46:59.710 --> 01:47:07.550]  But I do have good news on the point of, on incarcerated cannabis offenders front.
[01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:12.030]  I, I just thought it was an appropriate shout out given the topic. And also because I
[01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:17.070]  love the idea of doing a charity shout outs, but if anyone in the chat or if any of you guys have
[01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:26.670]  heard of the last prisoner project, they order a big supporter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:31.310]  They're working Colorado. They begun the cannabis competency program, and they've also worked with
[01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:37.470]  the governor's office and the department of corrections to secure and to secure an executive
[01:47:37.470 --> 01:47:43.070]  order, which, which expanded parole eligibility leading to the release of hundreds of people in
[01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:48.110]  categories most at risk to the virus. So it was like a specific program to get people like
[01:47:48.670 --> 01:47:53.070]  who are most likely to get sick out. And I only just found out about that today and I was like, that's sick.
[01:47:54.190 --> 01:48:00.510]  There, I believe there was a lot of, you know, inmates released, I think all over.
[01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:08.830]  I would imagine all over the country because I know that the regular prison systems are really
[01:48:09.710 --> 01:48:17.310]  suffering too. My dad's actually been in prison for like 25 years. And he said, it's,
[01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:27.470]  he said, it's gnarly right now. He said, they're like shut down. I mean, all the, a lot of dudes
[01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:31.870]  who are like higher levels too right now. I mean, they ain't seen the light of day.
[01:48:32.670 --> 01:48:35.710]  They're like on lockdown. They ain't getting out.
[01:48:38.590 --> 01:48:46.030]  It's a, it's sadly, well, we, we all, we all four sitting in this group, we all know you have to vote
[01:48:46.030 --> 01:48:50.750]  in November. You, we have to vote like your life depends on this. You know, we have, there has to
[01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:57.230]  be some changes. I, I am a big proponent. I consider myself an independent libertarian and I,
[01:48:57.230 --> 01:49:02.910]  who I think whoever is the best for the job should be doing the job. And it's proof positive that
[01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:08.190]  this commander in chief does not know what the hell he's doing. That being said, we need to
[01:49:08.190 --> 01:49:11.790]  address what's going on in this country and grasp some of these things that have been brought up
[01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:16.510]  right now. And people, young people need to get out and vote, man. They need to vote with their
[01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:21.230]  conscience and get out and use that right that they have. If you're over 18, you need to get out
[01:49:21.230 --> 01:49:26.350]  and vote. I've been voting for a lot, through a lot of presidents, good and bad, man, over the
[01:49:26.350 --> 01:49:32.430]  course of, and this is a big year, guys. This is going to affect y'all's future, man. I'll be dust.
[01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:36.510]  I'll be dust in a shelf somewhere. You know, people have me in an amulet somewhere on a
[01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:41.070]  necklace, that kind of crazy shit, you know, they're going to leave, leave you guys holding
[01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:45.870]  the bag on a lot of bad stuff. You know, where's it leave your kids? I have grandchildren now. It
[01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:50.510]  breaks my heart for my two little granddaughters to see what they're going to have 30 and 50 and
[01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:56.830]  60 and 80 years or 100 years from now, man. It's like if we don't address some of this stuff now
[01:49:56.830 --> 01:50:03.070]  and immediately and get control of it and get good people in place that understand that this plant,
[01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:08.830]  nobody should be in prison over a freaking plant. That's ridiculous. We need to address climate
[01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:13.310]  change, that it is real and it's happening. It proved positive if you live in California.
[01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:17.550]  I've been in Oklahoma, brother. I know why you're looking for plants that can handle 120 freaking
[01:50:17.550 --> 01:50:22.030]  degrees in the summertime. Yeah, it's kind of like come up to my neighborhood in the time.
[01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:26.990]  My little neck of the woods up here, we get 120 in the summertime here too. You know,
[01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:30.670]  it's just we have ocean influence, which you don't get. We get the Mediterranean
[01:50:30.670 --> 01:50:35.070]  effect here and that's what affects, makes the cannabis so special in this neighborhood.
[01:50:35.630 --> 01:50:44.510]  Yeah, we get bipolar weather so you could get rain at any time throughout this season.
[01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:53.230]  The Gulf of Mexico. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what, I don't really quite honestly, I
[01:50:53.230 --> 01:50:56.270]  hope that people will do that. Don't just talk about it and sit home.
[01:50:57.470 --> 01:51:04.190]  Either early mail, do what needs to be done. Get out and do it and do your thing,
[01:51:04.510 --> 01:51:07.710]  and support this thing and make this thing go forward. Because if we don't,
[01:51:07.710 --> 01:51:10.510]  we're going to repeat it next year, guys. Nothing's going to change.
[01:51:13.710 --> 01:51:23.310]  For the people in the chat, if your state has a big cannabis related vote, can you
[01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:26.270]  just speak up and say what it's specifically about?
[01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:28.510]  What's on the ballot for you guys?
[01:51:30.110 --> 01:51:30.830]  It's like everything.
[01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:32.510]  Doesn't mean it's good though.
[01:51:33.710 --> 01:51:40.590]  Yeah. That's the truth, Brandon. And you're right. Just because it's on the ballot doesn't
[01:51:40.590 --> 01:51:46.590]  necessarily mean it's the right approach. We were talking about how MedMen has affected
[01:51:46.590 --> 01:51:53.790]  legislation before, right? Yeah. And I think it was Massachusetts. I may be wrong, but I feel like
[01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:59.310]  it was Massachusetts or I don't think New York state because I don't think they know. Sorry.
[01:51:59.310 --> 01:52:04.030]  Actually, yeah. No, they now own a New York state license. So it may have been New York state.
[01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:07.150]  Wait, how'd they get a New York state license?
[01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:12.030]  So to me, that's always been the fucked up thing with state.
[01:52:15.070 --> 01:52:23.710]  So New York only, I think, allowed six licenses to be issued. And then to me, it's always like,
[01:52:24.670 --> 01:52:32.750]  you have all these criteria that you award someone on. I know West Hollywood had, it's like
[01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:42.190]  five areas where they would evaluate you. And so someone like that wins because they're like,
[01:52:42.190 --> 01:52:48.270]  this is going to be a good actor in our state or West Hollywood, our very small community.
[01:52:49.230 --> 01:52:54.270]  But then you can immediately flip it to a MedMen, which doesn't have to have any sort of like,
[01:52:57.070 --> 01:53:00.750]  the ones who want it were like, we're going to do right by everyone.
[01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:05.390]  And then they can immediately flip it and somebody else comes in who doesn't have to
[01:53:06.190 --> 01:53:13.950]  adhere to any of that. And so MedMen was one of those companies that in New York state,
[01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:22.350]  immediately after the six oligopoly licenses were issued, they were like, we'll buy number three.
[01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:30.670]  Peter, what state is it that had to shut everything down? Because there was so
[01:53:31.230 --> 01:53:40.030]  much corruption. Was it like Maine or something or Rhode Island? There was something going on.
[01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:50.270]  A bunch of the panel members from the Cheap Home Grow podcast that we do on Sundays,
[01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:56.910]  we were talking about one of the states that somebody was operating in and they had to shut
[01:53:56.910 --> 01:54:05.470]  everything down because basically the Senator, the Mayor, somebody in politics was basically making
[01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:11.470]  it so that their license went to somebody in their family and they were going to be the only
[01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:18.750]  one that was going to be able to operate. Shocking. Nepotism. I'm so shocked that that
[01:54:18.750 --> 01:54:29.390]  would happen. I mean, that happens. I hear stories of in California counties where the Sheriff's
[01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:37.870]  cousin owns a grow operation and the Sheriff will drive by six grows to go raid the biggest
[01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:47.870]  competitor to his cousin who has a grow. It's not far from the truth. Again, here last summer
[01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:54.030]  over in Trinity County, they were raiding areas in Trinity County and kicking in gates where people
[01:54:54.030 --> 01:55:00.110]  had spent 30, 40, $50,000 on permits and fees. Basically, we don't give a fuck what your papers
[01:55:00.110 --> 01:55:05.790]  say. We're here to knock your plants down. That's just, again, there's so much gray area.
[01:55:06.750 --> 01:55:12.590]  And you led to it earlier, Brandon, is there so much gray area that there aren't any rules. I said
[01:55:12.590 --> 01:55:17.070]  this and somebody else was talking to the other day. It's like, there aren't any, throw out the
[01:55:17.070 --> 01:55:21.390]  title of master grower. Brother, I've been growing this plant for almost five decades and I don't call
[01:55:21.390 --> 01:55:26.910]  myself a master grower. Every time I grow it, I learn something new. And that's just, again,
[01:55:26.910 --> 01:55:31.630]  to throw out that title out there, we don't even have to tell you. Well, Mia's currently growing
[01:55:31.630 --> 01:55:38.110]  one plant and she's already starting to color. Yeah, I had a question about this actually. So
[01:55:38.670 --> 01:55:48.030]  I have never, I have a, I don't, she has a plant. Like I have never been able to keep plants alive
[01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:53.390]  in my life before I have managed to kill succulents. So at one time I was working a weed event
[01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:57.870]  in LA where I was a joint roller, like back in the, back in the, back in the day, by which I mean,
[01:55:57.870 --> 01:56:07.230]  2017. And I was tipped with a banana OG plant that I killed within a week. It was bad. So I'm
[01:56:07.230 --> 01:56:13.390]  trying again with one plant. And I've been told by people who watch my stories that I have to keep.
[01:56:13.390 --> 01:56:16.750]  Well, first of all, what, what, what is it? And where'd you get it from?
[01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:24.110]  It was a gift. I have no idea what strain it is or what's in the soil, but I have the most basic
[01:56:24.110 --> 01:56:28.670]  nutrients and I'm doing super simple stuff, but I've been told by people who watch my stories
[01:56:28.670 --> 01:56:35.870]  that I need to defoliate it. I don't know what that means. That means pick off all the yellow
[01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:44.990]  leaves. Okay. Does that include all the yellow leaves? That's what basically what defoliation
[01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:50.590]  is. Yeah. I mean, that's what, what they're telling you to do is pick off all the leaves,
[01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:53.950]  sister. I can show you. It looks pretty good. You want me to show you?
[01:56:53.950 --> 01:56:56.030]  It doesn't have any yellow leaves on it though. It's pretty.
[01:56:56.030 --> 01:57:01.470]  Yeah. Brandon's going to show you. Yeah, I can show you, check this out. I can just go into my,
[01:57:01.470 --> 01:57:06.910]  my little tent that I have at my house. Oh my God. I have some old plants.
[01:57:07.710 --> 01:57:10.750]  There's a picture of what it looks like.
[01:57:10.750 --> 01:57:11.950]  12 plants. I should have cleaned this thing up.
[01:57:11.950 --> 01:57:13.470]  This is what the baby looks like right now.
[01:57:14.350 --> 01:57:16.270]  But I don't see any yellow leaves on there.
[01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:18.110]  No, no, no, no. Yeah.
[01:57:18.110 --> 01:57:24.910]  All right. So I have a bunch of stuff that I'm working on right now. Let me set this thing up
[01:57:24.910 --> 01:57:32.590]  here. This is a little project that I'm working on. It's the old purple cush that came from
[01:57:32.590 --> 01:57:41.950]  Oakster Dam in the mid nineties, crossed into MK Ultra, which TH seeds back in, I think 2003.
[01:57:43.150 --> 01:57:47.710]  Um, so it's a combination of that. Oh no, no, wait, no. This is the blueberry shiny
[01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:52.270]  What am I thinking? This is blueberry trainer MK Ultra. My friend made the blueberry train
[01:57:52.270 --> 01:57:57.230]  right back in San Diego. And, uh, anyway, so, Hey, can you see?
[01:57:59.230 --> 01:58:01.470]  Okay. I don't know what, what it looks like. Cause I can't see him.
[01:58:03.630 --> 01:58:08.750]  You're going to like default, like, so this plant right here is like super bushy, right?
[01:58:08.750 --> 01:58:12.430]  There's not a lot of light going on. There's like leaves. So what you can do is just to like,
[01:58:12.510 --> 01:58:18.830]  get better airflow for your plant. You can just kind of like pick off some of these like bigger
[01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:24.030]  leaves here. You can kind of like clean up some of the bottoms. Cause there's all these little
[01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:33.150]  like nodes right here. These, uh, they're, they're called, um, uh, uh, your bracts, but, um,
[01:58:34.110 --> 01:58:46.020]  you can clean those up. So that way you kind of have like a clean, a clean stem, like almost kind
[01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:50.580]  of like if you were going to take a clone, like if you're about to like clean something up so that
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:55.620]  we're going to cut it for a clone, you can clean up your plants like that. That's kind of what they
[01:58:55.620 --> 01:59:03.860]  mean. I believe. Is there an optimal time of day to do it? The bottom third of the plant is
[01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:09.940]  typically rolled down. I was being a little, being a smart ass earlier, sister, but it is take up,
[01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:13.780]  take off all your debt, pick off all the dead leaves. Different people tell you different
[01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:19.860]  things. It's usually you strip the bottom third to bottom half of the plant off. That is to
[01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:26.340]  increase, to increase the quality of your flower. Okay. That little fluffy stuff that down below,
[01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:30.980]  unless you're going to do like make hash or extracts or a whole plant, that kind of deal.
[01:59:30.980 --> 01:59:36.420]  Most people you strip that off and it gives you a better, more uniform flower and a more uniform
[01:59:36.420 --> 01:59:42.740]  finish is what the intention of defoliation is. Now different people do it different way,
[01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:46.420]  but like what Brandon's doing, he's going to clean all that bottom junk off underneath it.
[01:59:46.420 --> 01:59:50.820]  All the leaves, all the little, little nodes, little inner nodes that he was talking about.
[01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:54.980]  You just run your fingernail off of him and it just pops it right flesh. Then nothing will grow
[01:59:54.980 --> 02:00:00.340]  back in there. If you miss it a couple of weeks later, you'll go back in, you'll see a little
[02:00:00.340 --> 02:00:04.180]  growth coming out of him again. It doesn't mean anything. It's just, it's going to continue to
[02:00:04.180 --> 02:00:08.980]  grow until you flick the whole little part of it out and take it off the branch. Yep.
[02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:17.380]  I wonder if that bears any similarity to the way people prune wine grapes to gently
[02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:27.060]  the vine. So that it's like that concept. Okay, cool. Same principle. Yeah. Same general principle
[02:00:27.060 --> 02:00:32.180]  and rule of thought to send and the same reason why to improve the quality of the flower and
[02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:39.300]  improve the quality of the plant. That's the part of it again, craft and what he and I are both,
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:45.460]  what we, you know, again, we're flower guys. You won't see, maybe they do, I don't know,
[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:48.340]  commercial, you know, they're wanting the whole plant. So they're just, you know, they're not
[02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:54.420]  really doing the best kind of work. No, I do this on a commercial scale too. I clean everything up.
[02:00:55.220 --> 02:01:02.980]  Bravo. Yeah. Bravo, brother. I'm glad to hear you keep carrying heritage on large scale,
[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:08.820]  man. That's cool to see that translating across. It's important. It's really critical that again,
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:14.740]  he's growing to improve flower quality. And that's what defoliation is mostly for,
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:16.740]  is to improve your flower quality overall.
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:22.340]  So basically you're like gently stressing the plant out so that they invest in their output
[02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:29.380]  more and they deploy more. A little bit. It does do that. The hormone stimulation does do that.
[02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:35.140]  Where he's pinching at, it creates, okay, again, rule of thumb. If you pinch on the top and it
[02:01:35.140 --> 02:01:40.180]  makes it go out wide, if you pinch on the bottom, it makes it grow up tall. Okay. That's general
[02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:44.740]  rule of thumb. So where he's pinching down below and it's going to force the flower to grow up
[02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:48.020]  pinching down below and it's going to force the flower buds as they're growing up. It's
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:53.460]  going to encourage all the energy to go up and push the flower up and make it in theory,
[02:01:54.020 --> 02:02:01.300]  bigger, fuller, more mature, overall more weight. What he's trying to do more than anything is
[02:02:01.300 --> 02:02:04.980]  increase the quality of the weight of the flower, the bud, when the finished product's dry.
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:11.300]  And that's the trick to it. I see a lot of your crazy stuff, kids hanging pictures. I have three
[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:20.340]  pounds of wet bud. No, you got about a quarter of a pound, baby. I guarantee you, I bet,
[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:24.740]  Brandon, you ever put wet totals up when you're weighing all the pounds of wet weed?
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:26.280]  No.
[02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:32.740]  Exactly. Again, that's part of it. People don't realize it's like, you know what he's working on
[02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:37.940]  to try and increase this overall quality of the weight of the flower. And that's a lot of where
[02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:42.500]  the science has changed in the last 10 or 15 years with all the microbial stuff that's happening
[02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:49.060]  now. Well, that's a beautiful big fat indica leaf. Yeah, so these are all, they really express the
[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:57.700]  Master Kush and the ones that I already ran, they have that really nice blueberry train wreck mix
[02:02:57.700 --> 02:03:02.340]  in there. So I'm just going to breed for the best morphology. I'm looking, as you can see,
[02:03:02.580 --> 02:03:10.100]  this one has the Christmas tree where it grows out like one of those, what is it, a menorah?
[02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:15.460]  Is that what they're called? I don't know what they're called.
[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:16.580]  Menorah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:19.380]  Right? So like the candle holders type things?
[02:03:19.380 --> 02:03:19.880]  Yeah.
[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:23.860]  Our Jewish friends, help us out.
[02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:29.860]  Yeah. And then I have this one right here where it has closer node spacing,
[02:03:29.860 --> 02:03:35.060]  where the nodes are like, and not only does it have closer node spacing, but this one kind of
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:44.260]  has, almost has like world phylaxi where instead of just having one or two, it has like, you know,
[02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:48.180]  they're so close together where they just kind of stack almost on top of each other.
[02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:56.260]  And you're really, he does seriously the exact same thing I do. I could see the translation
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:04:01.940]  across the same approach I take, you know, node spacing, what kind of branching it is,
[02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:05.700]  every part of it is important when it comes to breeding. And that's part where the pheno
[02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:10.980]  selecting, but you know, people thought that word exotic and freaking pheno hunting. It's like,
[02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:15.940]  there's a lot to it that I just quite honestly don't think that a lot of young growers or people
[02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:21.140]  that call themselves breeders really understand, man. It's like, what he's starting is the beginning
[02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:28.420]  of a project. It's like my blue Scott plant is in now and F14 plant that's been involved over 14
[02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:35.140]  years of select back breeding. And just every portion of it is part of the process that I went
[02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:39.620]  through to get the plant to where what you're, what you and Peter are smoking this evening,
[02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:44.180]  you know, it's like, there's a lot of what Brandon's doing right now. That's the critical
[02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:49.540]  part of making the right decisions and not even making the right decisions. It's a decision that
[02:04:49.540 --> 02:04:52.900]  you feel comfortable with that you think is the right way to take the plant.
[02:04:53.460 --> 02:04:59.460]  Like the candelabra approach that he's referring to, what I refer to it, that's just standard issue
[02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:04.660]  of how I work with my plants is I, once they come up, I lean them over. And that's again,
[02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:10.820]  up here where we're at, you know, you give a guy one plant in a 10 by 10 area, man,
[02:05:10.820 --> 02:05:14.340]  you could fill that puppy up if you know what you're doing correctly. And that's a lot of
[02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:19.860]  the approach why the rules have changed so much over the last 26, 27 years, you know,
[02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:25.860]  you go back to 96. When we started here in California with the first medical laws and
[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:30.980]  where it's shifted from where the you know, how much footprints to how many plants you can have
[02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:37.220]  all that kind of jazz. It's like, to see where he's at doing this right now, live, it's really
[02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:42.500]  kind of cool watching how much we've, you know, how we've evolved in this community over the last
[02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:48.340]  two and a half decades. It's really cool seeing it. You know, it's like, this selection process,
[02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:52.740]  I'm glad to see him doing what he's doing. You know, it's cool seeing that that's happening in
[02:05:52.740 --> 02:05:58.020]  our world right now that he's taking his California knowledge and his California roots and taking it
[02:05:58.020 --> 02:06:04.500]  to a new territory and a new market and using it. You know, and it's obvious, I guarantee you,
[02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:08.660]  the people that taught him are guys that are my age, you know, men and women that we all hang
[02:06:08.660 --> 02:06:12.420]  around each other and stuff. You know, that's what I'm finding out is guys like
[02:06:13.220 --> 02:06:17.220]  people that I'm hanging with down south now that we all move to different portions of the state,
[02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:22.100]  you know, it's like it's just part of what it is, but the craft people, we're still here,
[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:27.620]  and I'm pleased to hear that Brandon's trying to do 15,000 plants craft style.
[02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:36.820]  Oh my goodness, look at that. Those are huge. Yeah, they're pretty big.
[02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:45.540]  I feel like somebody, I can also tell which ones are going to be male, even though they're not
[02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:52.420]  flowering yet, because some of them like want to like show presex where sometimes you'll get the
[02:06:53.380 --> 02:07:05.780]  the stamen. Stamen? Stigma? I can't remember. I think stamen. The stamen is the male part of the
[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:13.060]  plant, is it not? But it's also sticky. Oh, the stigma, sorry. That's the female, that's the
[02:07:13.060 --> 02:07:18.980]  pistil that you would normally see. Sometimes this variety, what I'm seeing is it'll throw pre
[02:07:19.780 --> 02:07:29.300]  pre-flower, so you'll see the stamen. Stigma? Whatever, I can't remember. I'm high.
[02:07:30.900 --> 02:07:36.500]  I'm just, I am so used to seeing stigmas and like fight the stigma, and now I'm like, wait,
[02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:40.980]  stigma is part of the plant? This is too confusing. It has no Google juice.
[02:07:41.780 --> 02:07:49.460]  Oh, I'm being spotlighted. I suppose I should smoke more weed now. This plant right here is
[02:07:49.460 --> 02:07:57.620]  not going to be selected. Why? Because it just, it's too, because it's going to have too much
[02:07:57.620 --> 02:08:02.580]  train wreck in it, and I don't want to, I don't want to breed towards the train wreck, because
[02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:10.260]  there's a reason why they call it train wreck. Oh, but I love train wreck. You're absolutely
[02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:17.140]  correct. Yes, there is. Because it's a train wreck. Once that thing hits flowering, I bet you
[02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:22.980]  that thing just goes out of control. It's just going to stretch. That's what they do, and then
[02:08:22.980 --> 02:08:29.460]  they can't hold their weight, and they flop all over the place. It's a mess. Brandon, you sayo
[02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:32.660]  offered to take it off your hands if you don't want it.
[02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:39.060]  I'm so sorry to hear that. I love train wreck, like how it tastes anyway.
[02:08:40.020 --> 02:08:46.260]  Well, the interesting thing is, it's not, it's the profile that I'm actually looking for.
[02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:53.380]  It's really interesting, because it's kind of like, it's almost like,
[02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:54.580]  it's almost like,
[02:08:57.940 --> 02:09:08.020]  it's this like, sweet, like, kind of musk that's not cheese, but kind of milky, and it has this,
[02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:15.460]  it has this blueberry profile, but it's also blueberry that's mixed in with like a pine lemon,
[02:09:15.460 --> 02:09:21.220]  like the train wreck, but it, it, the way that it layers on top of each other, it creates a like,
[02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:29.700]  really, really unique, like, the scent, and then the, the, the smoke that I'm looking for,
[02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:40.820]  is I'm looking for the, the kind of like, like, like musky fruit back end, like on the, on the
[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:46.980]  smoke. So it's going to take a bunch of work. I'll probably work this for a while. I think this is
[02:09:47.940 --> 02:09:53.380]  my main, my main one, because this was my favorite variety when I started this,
[02:09:55.620 --> 02:10:00.340]  this whole growing thing with the, with the guys that showed me back in 2002. They were doing it
[02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:07.300]  for like 10 years before me. Look at Doug, he's like, he's laughing at our timeline.
[02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:11.300]  I know, I know. Like when I said back in the day, 2017.
[02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:17.700]  I like talking to, I like talking to the OGs because they offer so much like insight on.
[02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:19.620]  So much perspective.
[02:10:20.580 --> 02:10:25.940]  Brandon, just quickly, someone asked a while ago, what lights you're using?
[02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:35.620]  Actually, it was really cool because we're, the facility that I took over as the cultivation
[02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:40.980]  director, they were fully integrated with the horticulture lighting group, which is a full
[02:10:40.980 --> 02:10:49.380]  spectrum LED. And they were running the 550 model, which is a 480 watt. Like I think it runs like 1.7
[02:10:49.380 --> 02:10:56.340]  watts on the phase three power that we have. They're really, really efficient. And I was just,
[02:10:56.340 --> 02:11:01.780]  you know, tagging them and showing them progress. And they came out with this new light, which is
[02:11:01.860 --> 02:11:08.660]  the 650, I think it's a 600 watt light. And they sent me one of these for free.
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:12.420]  So is this one on the market yet?
[02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:18.180]  Yeah, it's on the market. I really like these. I think that there's,
[02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:24.980]  obviously if you want to put the work in, you could build the same thing, right? But you're
[02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:30.820]  going to need to, if you're like a homegrown, you don't know much about it, or if you're just a
[02:11:30.820 --> 02:11:36.100]  beginner or something, you're going to have to do research. You can build these boards, you know,
[02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:42.740]  Samsung diodes, whatever, Meanwell drivers, or I don't know, something like that. But
[02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:51.540]  Brother, you're making it too complicated. You're making it too complicated. Spider makes a plug and
[02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:58.020]  play that's 159 bucks. It's a throwaway thing now. Yeah, I mean, I have one of those too.
[02:11:58.020 --> 02:11:59.380]  Too complicated.
[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:03.300]  Look at this is my throwaway right here, right? I got this for free.
[02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:10.580]  Yeah, no, they offered it and they actually have sent me lights. I have lights and a tent from them
[02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:13.380]  that I need to set up and start using. But, uh,
[02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:18.260]  Well, they were like, Hey, will you sign a contract and do all this stuff? And I was like, no.
[02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:24.180]  They were like, will you do an unboxing on YouTube? And I was like, absolutely not.
[02:12:25.060 --> 02:12:30.100]  No. Well, that's, that's the thing. I was like, nah, I'm not going to do that. And then I was
[02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:35.300]  like, but if you want to send me one anyway, here's my address. And then, uh, like a day later,
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:40.820]  she's like, do you have a phone number for the track so I can get you a tracking? And I was like,
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:44.660]  yeah. So I guess this is my shop, my official shout out.
[02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:51.620]  But that, and that's the funny thing. They actually won. They got you to mention that,
[02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:52.500]  right? Like
[02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:56.260]  They did. They kind of did. They got, they got it, but it's cool, dude. I mean, I've got my, uh,
[02:12:56.980 --> 02:13:01.700]  I've got the clones that, uh, Kevin Jodri sent me the, uh, the Mandelbrot.
[02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:04.580]  Oh, nice. So they came. All right. That makes me happy.
[02:13:05.220 --> 02:13:13.060]  Yeah. So I have the OG that he, he sent me. Um, and that's great because that's, you know, that's,
[02:13:13.700 --> 02:13:16.980]  that's, well, wait, all right. So, so how, how did he, uh,
[02:13:17.540 --> 02:13:21.060]  our clones sense and like a zip line bag?
[02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:22.260]  Well, it's hemp until it's not, right?
[02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:22.740]  What?
[02:13:22.740 --> 02:13:24.100]  It's hemp until it's not.
[02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:28.740]  No, no, I don't care. I'm not talking about that. I'm just saying like, what's the,
[02:13:28.740 --> 02:13:34.820]  what's, what's, how do you safely transport a baby, a baby plant across the country?
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:40.340]  Oh, uh, you just take a bunch of slips and then you wrap them up in a,
[02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:44.900]  like a wet paper towel, put them in a plastic bag.
[02:13:44.980 --> 02:13:47.780]  Hey, you got to make sure that those things are going to make it there quick because sometimes
[02:13:47.780 --> 02:13:52.100]  if they're in a plastic bag, they could mold, but that's probably because your fucking clones were
[02:13:52.100 --> 02:13:52.580]  shit.
[02:13:52.580 --> 02:13:56.740]  And, and, and step up on your shipping service, you know, step up on your
[02:13:56.740 --> 02:13:57.220]  Yeah.
[02:13:57.220 --> 02:13:57.700]  Yeah.
[02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:02.180]  So it's still old school. There's no like innovation and shipping clones.
[02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:04.580]  No. So check this out. You know what I used to do?
[02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:06.180]  Wet paper towel.
[02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:11.780]  I used to, I used to take a, you know how Disney used to make those big ass, uh, big ass V-signs
[02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:17.460]  VCR, uh, VCR tape cassette things.
[02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:18.580]  Oh yeah. Yeah.
[02:14:18.580 --> 02:14:19.940]  So what I used to do is
[02:14:19.940 --> 02:14:22.100]  Yeah, you don't remember that. You're like a baby.
[02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:28.180]  No, I remember way back when way, way, like some of my earliest memories,
[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:32.100]  they were cassette tapes with like Hercules on them. Like Disney, right?
[02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:33.780]  That's what you're talking about.
[02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:35.140]  You could take one of those
[02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:41.060]  You could take one of those and put, and put rooted cuts in those and then just close the lid.
[02:14:41.780 --> 02:14:45.860]  That was like, I did that way back in the day, but Hey, they have clone shippers now, dude.
[02:14:45.860 --> 02:14:51.220]  You just put, you just put your shit in a little cup that has a little secure thing on there and a
[02:14:51.220 --> 02:14:57.700]  little white little led light, and you can just send it. I mean, it's not that difficult.
[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:05.060]  Nice. But now with like, you can't even use a Blu-ray box or anything.
[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:08.180]  If you have to be a little key.
[02:15:08.980 --> 02:15:09.380]  You could.
[02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:13.300]  So, so how, how many clones did Kevin send?
[02:15:14.660 --> 02:15:16.100]  Um, he sent me a couple of them.
[02:15:17.460 --> 02:15:18.180]  Sent me a dozen.
[02:15:18.980 --> 02:15:19.380]  Nice.
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:21.780]  Yeah. Just to make sure.
[02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:28.180]  I'm totally, that reminds me, I have to follow up with the other winner of that.
[02:15:29.060 --> 02:15:35.300]  I'm baby. And I got the little humidifier here just because I don't, I'm not using a dome. I'm
[02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:36.980]  just keeping it real humid in here. So.
[02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:43.940]  Oh, I didn't realize that would help. I'm just leaving my single plant outside
[02:15:43.940 --> 02:15:47.700]  because I figured the sun's natural. It'll probably work.
[02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:53.940]  These have to be really humid. If they're not, the root plugs will dry out.
[02:15:53.940 --> 02:15:56.820]  Then it'll just, this is what the vapor pressure deficit.
[02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:03.860]  I always see, I always see babies in, um, dispensaries. And I wonder, I'm like being
[02:16:03.940 --> 02:16:06.340]  on this shelf can possibly be healthy for you.
[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:13.780]  Yeah. They're probably not super happy going from their initial home to like.
[02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:17.620]  Commercial retail backroom.
[02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:25.460]  Yeah. I always wonder what the shelf life is and if they rotate them or what the general
[02:16:25.460 --> 02:16:27.940]  practice is in dispensaries with clones.
[02:16:27.940 --> 02:16:33.060]  Up here, up here, sister. And I don't know about every place, but up here, it's like the
[02:16:33.060 --> 02:16:38.340]  clones are done in house here. You know, she has their own nursery where they grow
[02:16:38.340 --> 02:16:42.740]  their own cones. They take their own clones. It's very sterile. It's a laboratory. It's
[02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:46.980]  not what most people would consider, you know, but most people don't quite honestly get it.
[02:16:46.980 --> 02:16:51.620]  The average lay person doesn't understand the amount of lab lab work in the background
[02:16:51.620 --> 02:16:55.700]  on these things. Now it's got, it's moved a lot. You know, they're, they're in little
[02:16:56.260 --> 02:17:00.420]  further cubes with a few roots on that come in strips is like rock wool pulls apart.
[02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:05.620]  It's at least in California, at least in Northern California. Now I know it varies from, but
[02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:09.860]  again, I've got friends in Colorado that it's the same basic procedure. I'm sure
[02:17:09.860 --> 02:17:13.380]  Oklahoma does the same basic thing. When you go into a nursery where you're buying a plant,
[02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:18.340]  I don't know how much, how much, how much does the, uh, on babies there.
[02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:22.260]  If someone goes to a nursery, do you take them straight to the dispensary or how are you getting
[02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:24.900]  out of the accessing plants there in Oklahoma?
[02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:29.300]  It's a good question actually. It's a really good question. We, we actually have a nursery
[02:17:29.300 --> 02:17:36.580]  license, which has nothing to do with MMM, uh, OMMA. It's like just a regular business thing
[02:17:36.580 --> 02:17:44.260]  for a nursery. Um, and since we're vertically integrated and we can sell clones, uh, you know,
[02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:48.660]  it's just a thing where we fill out a manifest, say what's going, what, what's, you know, and
[02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:53.380]  where it's going to, and everybody signs the document and then they go to their new home.
[02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:56.100]  Uh, it, it's really easy out here.
[02:17:56.660 --> 02:18:01.380]  It seems to be you. Well, at least what I've read, I've kept up a lot on the Oklahoma scene
[02:18:01.380 --> 02:18:05.700]  because I quite honestly believe they've taken the best approach of all the states and made it,
[02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:10.340]  you know, what works best is streamlined. It's inexpensive. They're encouraging people to come
[02:18:10.340 --> 02:18:18.180]  there to pursue the craft. If you guys pass rec this year, not November, man, it's, is it going to pass?
[02:18:18.180 --> 02:18:19.460]  I don't think so.
[02:18:20.580 --> 02:18:22.260]  Not recreational?
[02:18:22.260 --> 02:18:23.620]  I don't think it will. No.
[02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:32.820]  I mean, there's, from the people that I've spoken to, everybody already kind of knows what's up. I
[02:18:32.820 --> 02:18:40.180]  mean, we weren't, there's been enough cannabis around the United States and enough people that
[02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:47.940]  have come from other places to know that like, Hey, we need to keep this how it is. Uh, so that
[02:18:47.940 --> 02:18:50.340]  it's not all fucked up like everywhere else.
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:51.540]  It is.
[02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:59.780]  I'm just saying there are some places that are, have so much bureaucracy and so much control that
[02:18:59.780 --> 02:19:03.940]  it makes it almost impossible for a normal person to operate.
[02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:11.940]  So when the states have kind of medical programs, some states are like, if your knee hurts,
[02:19:11.940 --> 02:19:15.940]  a doctor will write you a prescription for 25 bucks. And other states are like,
[02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:21.540]  only if you have one of these three conditions, can you get a medical card? So where does
[02:19:22.180 --> 02:19:28.900]  Oklahoma fall on the, like how basically my point is like, I'm going to have a medical
[02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:33.380]  program that's really wrecked. Cause it's so easy. And anybody who just wants weed can get it.
[02:19:34.180 --> 02:19:39.860]  So when I was in California, when I needed a medical card and they were like, Hey, you can
[02:19:39.860 --> 02:19:44.900]  get a medical card. Now I went in there and told them like, Hey, I smoke weed and I don't want to
[02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:50.020]  get in trouble. So can you write me a prescription? And the doctor was like, yep, because I'm not a
[02:19:50.020 --> 02:19:57.540]  fucking asshole. Um, and I think that's pretty much like anywhere. I mean, if, if you tell a
[02:19:57.540 --> 02:20:03.220]  doctor that, look, I use this regularly, regardless if it's recreational, it's still medical,
[02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:08.500]  cause you'd make you feel better or makes you more relaxed or helps you deal with your, your,
[02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:15.780]  your, you know, your daily grind, whatever it is, you know? Um, and people understand that.
[02:20:15.780 --> 02:20:19.620]  And if they don't understand that they probably shouldn't be given prescription in the first
[02:20:19.620 --> 02:20:27.700]  place. Um, but I think that it's a lot of it again, dude, it's all business, a lot of it. And,
[02:20:27.700 --> 02:20:33.460]  uh, you can get a medical card and it's not that expensive, you know? So it's not, you,
[02:20:33.460 --> 02:20:40.500]  you're not going to be excluded and you can find all levels of quality and price,
[02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:49.060]  you know, everywhere. So, yeah, I feel like it's really important to have entry-level products
[02:20:49.060 --> 02:20:55.620]  and then the mid range standard products and then the, and then the top, the top shelf.
[02:20:55.620 --> 02:21:02.740]  There's so many absurd ego loaded terms for, for the high quality cannabis. So we all know what
[02:21:02.740 --> 02:21:07.380]  we're talking about. And I feel like that range is a really important thing to preserve because
[02:21:07.380 --> 02:21:14.420]  homogeneity is extinction in so many ways. It's like the death of innovation, the death of art.
[02:21:16.980 --> 02:21:23.780]  You know, I, I think though that here you can build a really good brand. I think there's a lot
[02:21:23.780 --> 02:21:30.020]  of people that are doing it. Yeah. A lot of good cultivators and there's a lot of good companies.
[02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:38.420]  Um, and you know, for me, like the way that I like to envision what will happen is, you know,
[02:21:38.420 --> 02:21:45.700]  I have some things coming down the pipeline that are, you know, come from legacy growers,
[02:21:46.260 --> 02:21:55.060]  um, that I get to, you know, preserve that I know are like legit medicine, uh, doing, I got just
[02:21:56.020 --> 02:22:02.100]  being able to bring a different aspect and not kind of run what everybody else is doing. And
[02:22:02.820 --> 02:22:10.820]  is kind of my, my aim. Um, because there's a lot of stuff that got missed out here. Uh,
[02:22:10.820 --> 02:22:20.180]  people didn't get all the trouble berries and the bull riders and the, the AFGUs and the old skunks
[02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:26.180]  and the, just, you know, all the, all the stuff that I was like, Oh, I want to, you know, like
[02:22:26.180 --> 02:22:32.420]  that. I got hyped about back in, in the, when they first started naming weed. Right. Because there was
[02:22:32.420 --> 02:22:38.180]  a time when there wasn't, it was just like the fall was Dave, old Dave. It was old day.
[02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:46.580]  Uh, so it's true though. It's your truth. If the truth is Brandon, you're talking after the
[02:22:46.580 --> 02:22:50.740]  nineties, when they started putting names on top of it before that time, it really was. Cause that's
[02:22:50.740 --> 02:22:55.780]  how we ID'd it. Even between you and I, if we were passing seats back and forth, or we were passing
[02:22:55.780 --> 02:23:00.100]  plants back, I'd go, this is Brandon's plan or you, you know, this is Doc's plan. And that's just
[02:23:00.100 --> 02:23:06.180]  how it was. Or it would be like fishes mango. Cause it smells like mango. Exactly. Exactly.
[02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:13.140]  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I, I, I, I totally understand that. And, and I like, again, I, I,
[02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:20.020]  I'm not old enough to go back into like the mid nineties. I started smoking weed, I think in like
[02:23:20.740 --> 02:23:31.940]  in the late nineties, probably like 1998 or 1999. Um, and you know, but they, then for me, I mean,
[02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:38.500]  I didn't see a lot of like, you know, name brand. There wasn't like, you knew if you got something
[02:23:38.500 --> 02:23:43.940]  that had a name that like had a name, that was like a legit source that you were getting something
[02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:48.100]  really special. And it was rare, you know, other than that, it was just like, Oh, you're getting
[02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:53.700]  some of this or, you know, like, Oh, this is like I said, the Mexes or the Mendes or some,
[02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:58.740]  the mango was one of the ones that I always saw. And it was just some, it was commercial alcohol
[02:23:58.740 --> 02:24:04.260]  or commercial indoor, you know, it wasn't anything super special, but it was way, way better
[02:24:04.820 --> 02:24:09.380]  than what I was smoking. So it was like, yeah, we got all excited about it. You know,
[02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:17.380]  I remember on the East coast back when being like, what, what is it? And just being told it's weed
[02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:22.660]  and that's all. And that's all you would hear. Don't don't question.
[02:24:23.460 --> 02:24:30.580]  Just quickly, uh, Brandon, someone asked if your hand at your commercial facility,
[02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:36.420]  are you hand trimming or machine trimming? I wouldn't dude. Okay. Check this out.
[02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:43.060]  I know the answer, but it was, it was ass. Come on, come on. You guys,
[02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:50.740]  we have a really good team. Um, actually I met a really cool, uh, girl out here. She's from
[02:24:50.740 --> 02:24:57.460]  Oklahoma and she's, uh, had a team and she put them together and some other people I've actually
[02:24:57.460 --> 02:25:02.660]  what's been really, really cool is I've been able to give a lot because I'm not like all the people
[02:25:02.660 --> 02:25:08.100]  that own this company aren't from Oklahoma and I'm not from Oklahoma, but I've been able to give
[02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:17.060]  a lot of people from Oklahoma jobs and income. That's what it's all about. And that's such a
[02:25:17.060 --> 02:25:23.940]  better way to have cannabis give back to the community than just enormous taxes. Yeah. So
[02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:29.780]  that's the thing too. It's like those people are going out and they're, you know, they're,
[02:25:29.780 --> 02:25:35.060]  they're involved as well because they're a part of the community now. Right. So these people that
[02:25:35.060 --> 02:25:42.020]  were like, maybe just like smokers that were doing like Instagram stuff where they're doing like,
[02:25:42.020 --> 02:25:46.980]  you know, testing different people's products and stuff. And then, Oh, Hey, all of a sudden
[02:25:46.980 --> 02:25:52.260]  these people are, you know, working, doing trimming and stuff. It involves them more and
[02:25:52.260 --> 02:25:58.660]  it makes them feel more part of it, you know, and look, trimming isn't the, isn't the, isn't the
[02:25:58.660 --> 02:26:08.180]  most glorious thing to do. We all do our part. I don't mind it. I really don't. And I think,
[02:26:08.180 --> 02:26:15.780]  and I think that just having the involvement and doing special drops at, with you know,
[02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:21.380]  dispensaries like where for me, okay. There's a dispensary out here called Tegrity in the,
[02:26:21.540 --> 02:26:27.140]  and he's a, he's a OG. He's a really cool dude. He's an old head, you know, he, you know,
[02:26:27.140 --> 02:26:34.580]  did he name that before the South park episode? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know, but it's great. And
[02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:40.180]  it's hilarious. And it just plays off perfectly, but you know, it's like, there's people that are,
[02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:44.500]  that have really good shops and that are like really about community and they put on little
[02:26:44.500 --> 02:26:50.020]  competitions and they like give, you know, they just kind of give back to the community. So like
[02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:56.100]  doing special drops as like a cultivator who can have like some exclusive stuff, some heritage
[02:26:56.100 --> 02:27:01.860]  stuff from legacy farmers and do drops with these dudes and be like, Hey, we're going to bring this
[02:27:01.860 --> 02:27:07.060]  into your shop and you know, work the marketing angle and not, it's cool because you can hype
[02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:13.300]  things up. And when you bring it in, dude, and people are like, damn, like that's not just hype.
[02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:19.700]  That's, that's, that's the, that's the shit right there. So just quickly doc evergreen valley seeds
[02:27:19.700 --> 02:27:24.500]  asked if you can talk about Santa Cruz skunk or Boulder Creek Felton skunk.
[02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:29.700]  One more time. Santa Cruz skunk
[02:27:31.940 --> 02:27:41.940]  or Boulder Creek Felton skunk. I'm not familiar with either one. Okay. Yeah. I've been to,
[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:47.220]  I'm not familiar with, I'm not familiar with either one Peter, but that doesn't mean anything.
[02:27:47.220 --> 02:27:51.460]  You know what I mean? Again, it's like individual neighborhoods, small little
[02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:56.420]  valleys from independent valleys, you know, everybody has their own thing.
[02:27:56.980 --> 02:28:00.980]  That's the beauty of this craft, man. It's like, again, what I found is like,
[02:28:01.540 --> 02:28:05.460]  and I'm sure Brandon will agree with me on this. You know, it's like someone takes something from
[02:28:05.460 --> 02:28:10.340]  you and they take it and breed it with something else. That's theirs. You know, they created that,
[02:28:10.340 --> 02:28:16.020]  you know, it's like, I want everybody to again, grow your own practice, the craft,
[02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:20.660]  learn from reputable people, you know, spend time around people like him around people like me,
[02:28:20.660 --> 02:28:25.620]  other people that practice the craft, you know, it's like, there's a lot of commercialism out
[02:28:25.620 --> 02:28:32.820]  there. Mia, you know, she made mention of that. You know, you say there's a big line between craft
[02:28:32.820 --> 02:28:41.300]  and commercialism and fortunately like what Mia is a proponent of fine craft and heritage and,
[02:28:41.780 --> 02:28:46.580]  you know, hand trimming and all the things that make it true. You know, it's like,
[02:28:46.580 --> 02:28:51.620]  that's a big definer for me too, brother, you know, is it hand trimmed or is it machine done,
[02:28:51.620 --> 02:28:56.340]  you know, because that's part of it. And you're right. You've got people now coming into your,
[02:28:56.340 --> 02:29:02.100]  in there that are making a decent wage for carrying on a tradition of tried and true.
[02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:08.500]  You can't give it the love that a machine can't do that. You know, there's quite honestly,
[02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:12.660]  I've seen some trim mamas, man. It's amazing what they can do. It's the finished product is
[02:29:12.660 --> 02:29:19.220]  what people get what they see the end consumer gets and some trim teams come in and can handle
[02:29:19.220 --> 02:29:24.660]  that business and do it correctly and efficiently as quick, if not quicker than the machines can.
[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:28.500]  And their love isn't there, man. That's the bottom line is the love isn't there that
[02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:33.700]  commercial doesn't have it. And I got off topic on the plant, Peter. I don't, I'm not familiar with
[02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:38.660]  the strange, you know, but Santa Cruz, you know, again, Santa Cruz is the blue dreams known for
[02:29:38.660 --> 02:29:44.260]  coming from Santa Cruz County. That's where I got mice from a Santa Cruz creator, you know,
[02:29:44.260 --> 02:29:48.820]  sister Lynn, you know, anybody that knows who sister Lynn is back got 10 years on me.
[02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:54.260]  You know, again, people don't know who the whole, the whole folks are. They don't Instagram and they
[02:29:54.260 --> 02:30:00.740]  don't Facebook. Yeah. I would guess most of the people watching do not have 10 years on you.
[02:30:00.900 --> 02:30:08.740]  Do you feel like a lot of the people in your circles and the kind of people that have been
[02:30:08.740 --> 02:30:12.340]  doing this as long as you have have kind of been left out?
[02:30:14.900 --> 02:30:19.540]  Yeah. Well, you know, quite honestly, I have to say yes, Brennan, because again,
[02:30:19.540 --> 02:30:24.100]  I'm kind of in a test. I'm a test model for this area around here. You know, I'm the,
[02:30:24.100 --> 02:30:29.140]  I'm the voice for cannabis and in the, in the triangle up here for humble Mendocino for
[02:30:29.220 --> 02:30:32.980]  veteran cannabis, you know, I've got that base for it here in the voice for it here on a few
[02:30:32.980 --> 02:30:38.100]  of the radio stations. And a lot of them have, they wouldn't embrace the, even the thought
[02:30:38.100 --> 02:30:43.300]  of stepping up and stepping to the light two years ago. You know, I have a plant attorneys.
[02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:47.620]  Now I have a fricking branding team, all kinds of people that are working with me now that I
[02:30:47.620 --> 02:30:53.060]  didn't have before. And I'm kind of like you are brother. You know, I've been there, done that.
[02:30:53.060 --> 02:30:56.980]  It don't really scare me anymore. You know, if they want to do that to me, that's cool.
[02:30:57.060 --> 02:31:01.300]  If they want to do that to me, that's cool. You know, I'll deal with the consequences of it. And
[02:31:01.300 --> 02:31:06.180]  I kind of made a bet with my plant lawyer that we will see, you know, we're going to prove it one
[02:31:06.180 --> 02:31:10.260]  way or the other. I'm either going to go, well, I won't go to a six by nine. That ain't going to
[02:31:10.260 --> 02:31:14.260]  happen. You know, they don't want a hundred percent disabled veteran. You know, who wants
[02:31:14.260 --> 02:31:18.100]  to mess with that? You know, quite honestly. And I hate to say that, but that's the truth of the
[02:31:18.100 --> 02:31:22.980]  matter. You know, I'm in my sixties now, bro. You know, it's just a different.
[02:31:23.700 --> 02:31:31.220]  I would hope that if something like that happened, I think that there'd be a pretty
[02:31:31.220 --> 02:31:37.540]  good rally and support with the cannabis community. I think that whenever kind of one of our own,
[02:31:37.540 --> 02:31:44.340]  you can see, I see it all the time on social media. They're like, people really get behind
[02:31:44.340 --> 02:31:51.540]  others and give what they can to help others out. It wasn't there before, you know, it wasn't there,
[02:31:51.540 --> 02:31:54.740]  you know, it wasn't back there in the eighties. It wasn't there in the nineties. Hell, it's
[02:31:54.740 --> 02:32:00.340]  probably not even there in a lot of places. Look, this is the thing, right? Because like,
[02:32:00.340 --> 02:32:05.780]  like your best friend, wasn't coming over to your spot. Like nobody was you and your partner knew
[02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:09.300]  where that shit was and nobody else. And you couldn't have anybody else, dude.
[02:32:09.940 --> 02:32:15.140]  Well, I didn't, I didn't until two years ago. You know, I didn't hang. I mean, I really didn't. I
[02:32:15.140 --> 02:32:19.620]  don't hang around a lot of people now, quite honestly. You know, it's like the circle is small
[02:32:19.620 --> 02:32:26.020]  here of the people that have access. So when I was younger and I, in, in the, in my, in my older
[02:32:26.020 --> 02:32:33.060]  homies showed me what's up, like my mouth was shut. Like I didn't do I, you know, I never said
[02:32:33.060 --> 02:32:39.140]  anything, but when I started doing my own stuff, I was a little bit more like open about it because I
[02:32:39.140 --> 02:32:43.620]  didn't want to fucking hide, you know, but I wasn't open about it to everybody, but I had like
[02:32:43.620 --> 02:32:48.900]  my friends, like my circle and they knew what was up, dude, you know? And it was like, it was, it,
[02:32:48.900 --> 02:32:55.940]  it just made me feel better because it's, it would, it just, it's, it almost hurts to like,
[02:32:55.940 --> 02:33:04.180]  have to like, not be able to share. Like what I hope, I hope to see that. I would love to see a
[02:33:04.180 --> 02:33:09.380]  point where we can bring the older, the older OGs out into the community. You know, I don't know
[02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:14.340]  where the environment's at. You know, a lot of them, they, they've disconnected from it because
[02:33:14.900 --> 02:33:20.660]  of fear and age and a lot of, you know, environment and all that kind of jazz. It's really,
[02:33:21.220 --> 02:33:27.940]  it's, it's sad. I hope that, I hope that they can, there is an opportunity for that to happen
[02:33:27.940 --> 02:33:33.060]  where we can see some of that come out, you know, and you, and you are the, it is the truth, man.
[02:33:33.060 --> 02:33:37.380]  People are scared of what the law enforcement will do to their, you know, here in this neighborhood
[02:33:37.380 --> 02:33:41.940]  specifically, we're quiet, you know, I have grown children. They're in their mid to late thirties,
[02:33:41.940 --> 02:33:46.580]  almost 40 years old now, you know, and it's like what you said, man, and they raised by your rule,
[02:33:46.580 --> 02:33:50.500]  brother. We don't talk about cannabis, man. We don't talk about, excuse me. We don't talk about
[02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:56.660]  marijuana in this household. And they, they didn't, you know, and they did today is grown
[02:33:56.660 --> 02:34:02.340]  adults in their own lives. You know, they love the plant on their own ways, you know, by law,
[02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:06.500]  by law, unfortunately they can't use it because of their jobs. You know, again,
[02:34:07.060 --> 02:34:11.300]  it's a fricking plant, you know, that's the part that bothers me is like, we, we, the part with the
[02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:16.580]  plant that bothers me is, you know, we've, we've accepted alcohol, we've accepted prescription
[02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:22.260]  painkillers, we've accepted all these other things. We've normalized all these other evil things that
[02:34:22.260 --> 02:34:26.420]  completely destroy the human body, but something that can really quite honestly is going to be the
[02:34:26.420 --> 02:34:32.500]  key to a lot of fixing, fixing a lot of things that are wrong with this world and ailments and human
[02:34:32.660 --> 02:34:38.340]  wrong with this world and ailments and human body ailments and things, you know, the afflictions of
[02:34:38.340 --> 02:34:44.420]  mankind that the sacred plant, the plant of life is going to fix over the next 10 years. You know,
[02:34:44.420 --> 02:34:49.860]  it's like, it's coming along. It's coming, man. You know, I'm hoping that we see it. I'm hoping
[02:34:49.860 --> 02:35:00.940]  that we see it as quickly as we can. You know, absolutely. I'm not sure if Brandon's phone
[02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:06.780]  might've died just now. Nope. I'm still here. I was just putting the dog. I was just trying to
[02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:15.180]  get the dog outside. He's whining at me. So why don't we, as everybody is smoking,
[02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:20.540]  why don't we wrap it for the night? I love, we were actually going to only go an hour.
[02:35:21.420 --> 02:35:26.540]  Yeah. It was like, we're going to do an hour and then mention like prisoner project and then take
[02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:31.340]  some questions. But then it was like the more, the merrier if people want to join in and it just
[02:35:31.340 --> 02:35:36.860]  turned into this beautiful conversation. So thank you so much for hanging out, Brandon and John.
[02:35:38.380 --> 02:35:43.020]  And just quickly, Brandon, someone asked, how can I get the lime-a-rilla?
[02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:54.780]  Look, okay. Everybody is like, just waiting. I'm going to do a drop, but I'm working with
[02:35:55.740 --> 02:36:02.220]  Jackson. Okay. Me and Jean, we're waiting. So you guys just have to be patient and you guys
[02:36:02.220 --> 02:36:06.620]  will be able to get your hands. You'll be able to get your hands on it.
[02:36:09.020 --> 02:36:14.300]  Excellent. And we'll see you again in a mirror two days or three days, Thursday.
[02:36:14.380 --> 02:36:22.940]  All right. Well, thanks everyone. Thanks to Haroon, who I doubt is watching right now, but
[02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:26.380]  But it was amazing to have him on.
[02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:34.300]  Conceptually, I like the idea of Haroon with amazing bandwidth capabilities,
[02:36:36.380 --> 02:36:40.700]  walking us or introducing us to his friend who is
[02:36:40.780 --> 02:36:49.180]  introducing us to his friend who is his model smoker and all the cultivators there.
[02:36:50.220 --> 02:36:52.140]  Yeah. Get him and Frenchie on them.
[02:36:54.140 --> 02:36:56.140]  Some passion. We need some passion.
[02:36:58.860 --> 02:36:59.260]  All right.
[02:37:00.940 --> 02:37:04.300]  All right. So with that, thank you everyone. And
[02:37:06.460 --> 02:37:07.180]  I'm out.
[02:37:07.180 --> 02:37:11.500]  And doc, I like the blue skunk. That's my thumbs up.
[02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:16.300]  Thank you, Peter. Thanks. Thanks, brother. Appreciate that. Appreciate that. Glad. Hope
[02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:21.820]  that it's enjoyable and does what I believe it's good for. It's a great everyday weed.
[02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:26.540]  It's great for smoke during the day. It keeps you calm, keeps you balanced. Beautiful, beautiful.
[02:37:26.540 --> 02:37:29.180]  At least mine, it's old man weed.
[02:37:29.180 --> 02:37:30.860]  So it's relaxing.
[02:37:32.540 --> 02:37:33.180]  I feel good.
[02:37:33.180 --> 02:37:34.540]  Thank you so much.
[02:37:34.540 --> 02:37:35.820]  All right. Thanks everyone.
[02:37:35.900 --> 02:37:37.340]  Bye Mia. Bye.
[02:37:37.340 --> 02:37:37.900]  Bye.
