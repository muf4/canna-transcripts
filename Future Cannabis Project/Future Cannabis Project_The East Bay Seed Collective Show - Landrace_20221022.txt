[00:00.000 --> 00:09.520]  What's up, everybody? We're live. It's showtime. It's go time with the East Bay Seed Collective
[00:09.520 --> 00:27.380]  Show. Yeah, we have some pretty cool, we have a cool guest coming on today. One of our guests
[00:27.380 --> 00:33.940]  has to work, but I think I got some pretty cool information and content for us to talk
[00:33.940 --> 00:42.700]  about today. But I'm just trying to get started, start a little bit slower, just in case when
[00:42.700 --> 00:49.420]  people are coming on, they don't get a chance, they don't miss anything. But yeah, see how
[00:49.420 --> 00:58.300]  everybody's doing in the chat today. Three things I wanted to talk about before we had
[00:58.300 --> 01:01.660]  our guest come on. Okay, we'll meet back up. So the guest that we have coming on today
[01:01.660 --> 01:10.460]  is Al or Aladdin from Khalifa Genetics. Actually, the first show, the first time I was on Future
[01:10.460 --> 01:17.660]  Canvas Project was on the James Loud Show. And Khalifa Genetics was there, Al from Khalifa
[01:17.660 --> 01:25.180]  Genetics was the other guest. And he's a super cool dude. Yeah, super cool dude. He's actually
[01:25.180 --> 01:30.060]  been making videos for a really, really long time. That's something I need to ask him,
[01:30.060 --> 01:40.260]  how long have you been making videos? Because I mean, I recall him making videos.
[01:41.700 --> 01:46.260]  Gosh, it's been, it feels like over 10 years he's been doing it. It could be even longer than that.
[01:46.260 --> 01:54.100]  But he's a pretty cool dude. He has some really interesting YouTube videos on, I think some of
[01:54.100 --> 02:01.220]  them on like nomenclature. So like vocabulary for cannabis breeding. He has all kinds of stuff on
[02:01.220 --> 02:06.340]  Landry's genetics, on his genetics, on how to breed, all kinds of really interesting stuff.
[02:06.580 --> 02:12.340]  So yeah, I mean, he does that, you know, to like, bring traffic over to his
[02:17.060 --> 02:24.180]  page. Yeah, he's coming on today. He's a wealth of information. And he also breeds with a lot of,
[02:25.060 --> 02:31.060]  you know, heirloom and landrace genetics. He works them into modern lines to make
[02:31.700 --> 02:38.260]  new interesting stuff. Honestly, I have not grown any of his stuff. But I would really like to have
[02:38.260 --> 02:44.100]  had an eye on a few of his things. He had some like, Afghani lemon Blanco type stuff I thought
[02:44.100 --> 02:54.340]  looked pretty cool. Gosh, well, it's nine in the morning. So it's a hard time to start to start
[02:54.340 --> 03:01.540]  your startup podcast because my brain is hasn't been going, you know, it's not already warmed up
[03:01.540 --> 03:15.220]  yet. And greetings, Jesse and Viraj. And Danny as well. Yeah, my brain is not fully woken up yet.
[03:15.220 --> 03:21.620]  I don't drink coffee. So I got early. That's not really what helps me. But what does help me
[03:21.620 --> 03:31.940]  is to turn on the volcano. All right, we got like 30 people on right now. So we'll get started.
[03:33.060 --> 03:36.020]  So the first thing I wanted to talk about is Harvest Flow. You know, like,
[03:36.740 --> 03:42.100]  I'm assuming a lot of people are vets, you guys have been doing this for a long time. I don't want
[03:42.100 --> 03:46.820]  to, you know, assume that everybody knows all this information. So a lot of the things I'm kind of
[03:46.820 --> 03:58.100]  going over, you may already know, you may not know, but yeah. So we're gonna start with Harvest Flow.
[03:59.140 --> 04:08.740]  So basically, we've had our whole outdoor season. For me, it was great, really lucky and, you know,
[04:08.740 --> 04:15.060]  blessed to have the weather be very cooperative this year. I think we had maybe two days that
[04:15.060 --> 04:22.420]  were over 100. And that was pretty much it. Maybe five days over 90. It was a really low key,
[04:22.420 --> 04:29.700]  it was really even. Hey, Callie, hi, and Green, Gatlin. You guys are gonna see how
[04:29.700 --> 04:34.340]  well my reading is, which is terrible. But yeah, we're having people come on. Good morning.
[04:35.380 --> 04:39.380]  So yeah, basically, you know, this year for me went really well. I know some people had
[04:39.380 --> 04:47.220]  some heat waves, but people are harvesting. It's, you know, it's very important that when you
[04:47.220 --> 04:59.220]  harvest that you do it in a methodical manner. Why is it? Why is that important? Well, the more
[05:00.260 --> 05:07.620]  chaotic and hectic you are during your harvest, easier it is to one, degrade your trichomes.
[05:08.580 --> 05:15.220]  Two, get your cannabis mixed up, which is a huge bummer when you don't know what the strain is.
[05:16.260 --> 05:25.780]  And three, to just have a bad experience and not even degrade your trichomes, but
[05:25.780 --> 05:32.420]  degrade the material that you're working with. So letting it mold, letting it get too dry,
[05:32.500 --> 05:37.540]  all of these various too wet, too dry, all the different things that come into that.
[05:38.180 --> 05:43.940]  So it's extremely important that you're methodical with your harvesting, that you have your space
[05:43.940 --> 05:52.980]  already set up. And, you know, I had this issue this year, which was not enough space to dry all
[05:52.980 --> 05:59.380]  the cannabis that I had. And if I had to harvest everything at once, I would definitely not have
[05:59.380 --> 06:14.340]  even close to enough space. So one, you want to make sure that you harvest in phases. So, you know,
[06:14.340 --> 06:19.380]  the early stuff goes first, which is the indicas, and then your hybrids go and then your sativa
[06:19.380 --> 06:26.340]  hybrids, and then your pure sativas are mostly sativas. That's very important. That's also very
[06:26.340 --> 06:32.340]  important in case you have a shitty year, not everything is going to go bad. You know, you have
[06:32.340 --> 06:38.660]  things that are at various levels of maturity at different times. That's very, very, very important.
[06:40.660 --> 06:46.340]  So, you know, having things ready at different times is important. So you have enough space in
[06:46.340 --> 06:51.300]  your facility or your garage or whatever to dry all your stuff, making sure that you're in the
[06:51.300 --> 06:57.220]  right mental state and that you have the correct amount of time, which is really important. I'm a
[06:58.260 --> 07:05.060]  stay at home dad, I watch my kid. So I don't have a lot of time to harvest my plants, but I do have
[07:05.060 --> 07:11.060]  time to do it. And when I do it, I really try to be as methodical, slow, intentional as possible.
[07:11.060 --> 07:18.660]  So I'm not stepping on buds, I'm not, you know, damaging trichomes. So I'm not cutting myself,
[07:19.620 --> 07:22.900]  all those various things. I'm not getting trichomes in my eyes.
[07:24.660 --> 07:31.220]  All those things are super important. And a lot of it really comes with experience and time. I've
[07:31.220 --> 07:38.580]  actually had years where we were harvesting in the rain, and I was sleeping in the drying area
[07:38.580 --> 07:44.900]  with wet feet, and I got like super sick and over half the crop molded. So like, there's all different
[07:44.900 --> 07:51.940]  kinds of things that can definitely happen. This person is saying, how long do you drive for and
[07:51.940 --> 07:57.700]  what times? So I'll be honest, you know, I'm an outdoor guy, I have a garage that I dry in,
[07:59.060 --> 08:08.500]  I don't use an AC to keep my dry room dry. So whatever the garage is at is what it dries at.
[08:08.500 --> 08:13.620]  And you know, like, I live in Northern California, it's pretty dry this year. I took stuff down,
[08:13.620 --> 08:21.060]  it dried in about seven to 10 days. So pretty quick. And you know, that goes again to what I'm
[08:21.060 --> 08:26.420]  talking about. Because once your material is dry, you then need to put it into your totes or your
[08:26.420 --> 08:32.100]  bins or whatever, so it doesn't continue to over dry. So yeah, the first stuff that I harvested,
[08:32.740 --> 08:40.340]  like 10 days ago, that stuff is now in bins. And, you know, I'm trying to slow down that drying
[08:40.420 --> 08:46.340]  process. Also, something pretty old school that I still like to do is I'll put orange peels
[08:46.980 --> 08:52.820]  in with the material if it dries out a little too much. I'll put in some orange peels just to let it
[08:52.820 --> 09:00.500]  re-moisten a little bit. The citric, I guess it's like citric acid in there can kind of help.
[09:01.140 --> 09:06.580]  All right, yeah, NorCal, yeah, NorCal was a killer year this year. Citric acid and those orange peels,
[09:06.580 --> 09:12.260]  you know, help to re-moisten the material. You know, I know that people have different
[09:12.260 --> 09:17.700]  thoughts about that, but I'll be honest, I like orange peels better than bovitas.
[09:18.340 --> 09:24.580]  I would much rather have it impart the smell of an orange over the smell of like a synthetic bovita
[09:24.580 --> 09:29.460]  pack. And I feel like it doesn't really get orange smell. I've used orange for years and people don't
[09:29.460 --> 09:34.900]  say that my cannabis smells like oranges. It smells like whatever it, you know, whatever it needs to
[09:34.900 --> 09:43.140]  be. So yeah, you know, make sure you move it once it's dry, you put into your bins and keep those
[09:43.140 --> 09:54.500]  bins moist. You want to check those bins on the daily, regular. Yeah, that's super important.
[09:55.780 --> 10:03.620]  Another thing is there are little digital, I guess it's a humidity meter. Very, very,
[10:03.620 --> 10:10.500]  very useful. I guess, cause I'm the only person on, I'm not going to go grab one, but they're,
[10:10.500 --> 10:15.380]  they're really tiny. They're pretty cheap. You can probably buy them on Amazon or any other
[10:15.380 --> 10:25.140]  thing like that. But it's actually really helpful because you can have an idea of really how dry
[10:25.140 --> 10:29.700]  your environment is. And a lot of places like where I live in the Bay area in California,
[10:29.700 --> 10:35.460]  it's pretty dry. Things dry out really quick. And you want to be able to see that meter and
[10:35.460 --> 10:43.540]  to be able to regulate how humid your material is. I mean, I'm not the curing master, you know,
[10:43.540 --> 10:51.220]  that's not my crazy strong point. So like, I don't know for me, like 50, 60% in between there
[10:51.860 --> 10:58.180]  is fine. I mainly, you know, touch the bud. If it has some, you know, squish to it, that's good.
[10:58.180 --> 11:03.620]  If it's kind of hard, that's good. You don't want it to sponge, you don't want it very spongy. You
[11:03.620 --> 11:09.540]  don't want to keep pressing it in and then it like stays in like that. That's too moist. But I mean,
[11:09.540 --> 11:17.140]  honestly, the best way to tell how well your material is, is the smoking test. Smoking is
[11:17.140 --> 11:22.420]  the most, Hey, good morning, Nick. Smoking is, Oh, we got our, we have ex president on.
[11:22.820 --> 11:28.180]  The smoke test to me is the most important, best way to tell how your material is drying.
[11:28.820 --> 11:35.300]  And this is how you do it. You take your material and you roll a joint. If you try to spark that
[11:35.300 --> 11:42.660]  joint and it doesn't light, then you know, it's too moist. If you try to light it, it burns like
[11:42.660 --> 11:48.420]  once, you know, one or two draws and then it burns out, you know, it's almost there, but it's still
[11:48.500 --> 11:54.180]  too moist. So, you know, the joint test, the smoke test for me is really the best way.
[11:54.180 --> 11:58.500]  Or if you smoke a bowl or a bong or whatever, it's the same thing. You know, you put in the bowl,
[11:58.500 --> 12:02.660]  you light it up and you can kind of taste it. You can kind of tell if it's not that right
[12:04.420 --> 12:09.060]  texture, that right consistency. But at the same time, on the other hand, if it's too dry,
[12:09.620 --> 12:13.380]  you put it in your grinder, you grind it up and it just turns into like dust. Like you don't
[12:13.540 --> 12:19.460]  want it to be so dusty and so dry that when you roll it, it's kind of almost like sand in there.
[12:20.340 --> 12:27.140]  Well, some people like that and honestly it burns killer. So let me back up. When your material is
[12:27.140 --> 12:32.900]  too dry, in my opinion, it often burns really nice. Sometimes it's a little bit harsh, but
[12:32.900 --> 12:40.740]  sometimes it's great, but it doesn't, you know, it doesn't burn as well as you'd like it to burn.
[12:41.540 --> 12:47.300]  It doesn't preserve as well. It doesn't stay as well in the bag. If the bag gets touched or
[12:47.300 --> 12:52.420]  bruised in any way, the trichromes are going to fall off. The material just doesn't get a chance
[12:52.420 --> 12:59.060]  to cure in the proper way when it dries, when it dries that quickly. And when it's that dry,
[12:59.060 --> 13:05.380]  the material just degrades quickly. Yeah. Danny's talking about burping and breathing.
[13:06.100 --> 13:15.540]  I'll back up. When you have your stuff in your bins and yeah, you're going to basically burp
[13:15.540 --> 13:20.260]  them every day. So you're just going to open your bin and close it, open your bin and close it.
[13:20.260 --> 13:25.220]  Kind of look through your buds. You got to literally look through the different jars,
[13:25.220 --> 13:31.380]  look through the buds, look through the biggest ones, crack them open. And you just have to do
[13:31.380 --> 13:37.780]  that for, I don't know, usually a few weeks to maybe a month just to, until all that material is
[13:40.820 --> 13:46.900]  modestly dry. Another really good technique that they do in dispensaries or they used to do,
[13:47.540 --> 13:54.580]  excuse me, medical days is to stem snap. Just go and snap the stem, snap the stem. If the stem is
[13:54.580 --> 13:59.860]  snapped, that means that the material is dry. If you go to snap the stem and the stem bends,
[14:00.580 --> 14:06.900]  then you know, Hey, what's up Dalton? If you bend the stem and if you've got to snap the stem and
[14:06.900 --> 14:11.780]  it bends, you know that that material is still wet. So that's super important to go through all
[14:11.780 --> 14:17.780]  of your material and, you know, continuously make sure that those stems are snapped.
[14:19.540 --> 14:26.020]  Also make sure that you do that or make sure that you do that with your head nugs. That's super,
[14:26.020 --> 14:36.740]  super, super important that your head nugs do not get moldy. I had a head nug, it was beautiful.
[14:36.740 --> 14:42.180]  I was saving it for six months of the most heady stuff. Gosh, this must've been 10, 15 years ago.
[14:42.900 --> 14:48.900]  And you know, I went in finally to open up and smoke that nug. It must've been six months after
[14:48.900 --> 14:55.860]  I had it and it wasn't fully dry and it was moldy on the middle. And it was just like,
[14:57.700 --> 15:00.820]  it was a lesson, you know, that was a lesson that I had to learn. Well,
[15:01.700 --> 15:07.380]  oh yeah, yeah. Digital humidity monitors fits in a jar. Yeah, yeah, they're tight.
[15:09.140 --> 15:13.540]  That was a lesson that I had learned. I was like, all right, well, you know, don't keep your head
[15:13.540 --> 15:21.780]  nugs nice and fat. Like it was a nice long one in a big old jar. Don't do that. You know, just don't.
[15:22.980 --> 15:29.380]  Another little technique that I learned the hard way is when you have your indica dominant stuff
[15:29.380 --> 15:35.220]  or your pure indica, your stuff that's like, you know, nice long colas with no spacing in between
[15:35.220 --> 15:40.900]  the buds, I would highly suggest literally chopping the bud up into as many pieces as you
[15:40.900 --> 15:46.660]  can and trying it on like a rack, trying it not on hangers. And the reason why is if there's any
[15:46.660 --> 15:52.340]  moisture in there, if there's any mold in there, it's so easy for us to travel all along the bud.
[15:52.340 --> 15:56.980]  And that kind of, to me, it reminds me of like how you see a wet napkin and it's like one little
[15:56.980 --> 16:04.420]  spot gets wet and then it just starts spreading to the whole thing. And so how do you fight
[16:04.420 --> 16:12.660]  against that? You literally just hang for six weeks. So my issue is if you hang it before it
[16:12.660 --> 16:17.700]  even gets a chance to dry, the mold can spread. And so what I recommend is when you have those
[16:17.700 --> 16:21.940]  buds that are really big and all connected and touching, you just chop it up and do as many
[16:21.940 --> 16:28.740]  pieces as you can. I did that this year and I got zero mold on that plant. Zero mold. I was really
[16:28.740 --> 16:37.300]  extremely, extremely happy with that. Okay. So people are talking about 62 is a good humidity
[16:37.300 --> 16:42.020]  level. I mean, I'll be honest, like I said, that's just not my strong point. I really just use it
[16:42.020 --> 16:50.900]  from experience, touching, from tactile of my own experience of feeling. And that's the easiest way
[16:50.900 --> 16:59.620]  for me to figure it out. And like I've said before on previous episodes, when you have outdoor,
[16:59.620 --> 17:06.100]  really the first thing is to get it is to over dry it almost. And I mean, some people would be
[17:06.100 --> 17:12.020]  like, oh, like you want to slowly dry it. And yes, you do want to, if you have that ability. But a lot
[17:12.020 --> 17:17.380]  of times when people are growing outdoor, it's just a different thing. It's a different sport.
[17:18.020 --> 17:23.620]  It's just a different beast. And in general, what you do is you want to dry it pretty quickly.
[17:24.340 --> 17:28.740]  And then you can move on to your next steps. You dry it and then you store it away. And then you
[17:28.740 --> 17:35.700]  dry your next batch and store it away and dry it. So it's not as slow and steady as with the indoor.
[17:35.700 --> 17:40.420]  And also there's the volume, the amount is so much more that it's a lot more difficult for people to
[17:40.500 --> 17:47.940]  do that. This person outdoors finding warmer spots. Yeah. Yeah. And that's totally true. I
[17:47.940 --> 17:53.060]  mean, for outdoor, like I had a few plants that did not get as much sun as others. The ones that
[17:53.060 --> 18:01.860]  got less sun were definitely not as chunky. So yeah, I mean, so basically with harvest flow,
[18:01.860 --> 18:07.620]  we're about wrapping that one up and moving to the next section, which I really like, which is
[18:07.620 --> 18:13.460]  scissors. And, you know, I used to work at a hydro store, so I knew a little bit about scissors.
[18:13.460 --> 18:21.940]  I mean, it's not that complex of a topic, but all right. So for years I only use these. I was the
[18:21.940 --> 18:28.420]  bro who only would use Fiskars. This is all I had in my house was Fiskars. I think they're great for
[18:29.060 --> 18:34.900]  indoor. They're awesome scissors for years, but like, honestly, I have some like really
[18:34.900 --> 18:42.340]  interesting like hand issues, getting older. And I used Fiskars last night for the first time,
[18:42.900 --> 18:50.660]  I guess, since last year, and I got crazy blisters all over my hands, which was really surprising.
[18:52.340 --> 18:56.180]  So I'll show you a couple tips that people do with their Fiskars to make them
[18:56.740 --> 19:00.340]  better. And I only learned these from working at a hydro store. So
[19:00.740 --> 19:05.780]  probably the biggest tip is people will take out the Fiskars spring. It's too
[19:07.220 --> 19:13.860]  rigid. A lot of people will replace these Fiskars springs with other company springs
[19:13.860 --> 19:19.460]  that are a little bit softer, a little bit more spongy. Other people will also cut some of the
[19:19.460 --> 19:29.380]  Fiskars spring so that it doesn't spring out as hard every single time. And, you know, I definitely
[19:30.340 --> 19:36.580]  noticed that when we would be selling scissors during harvest time, the people who
[19:37.940 --> 19:41.860]  we were selling scissors during harvest time for trimmers or trimmer grunts or whatever,
[19:41.860 --> 19:50.180]  they were not using these scissors. They were using these. But before we get into Chikomasa,
[19:50.180 --> 19:56.660]  I wanted to get into these little what they call gyros, the like bootleg Fiskars that, you know,
[19:57.220 --> 20:03.460]  you'd give to your second rate trimmers usually, you know, or like your buddies who are trimming,
[20:03.460 --> 20:09.380]  you'd give them these and often they have that like curve to it, which is cool. I mean,
[20:09.380 --> 20:14.020]  I don't know, like the curve is not particularly my thing. Like if I have them, I'll use it.
[20:15.140 --> 20:20.900]  The curve actually is kind of nice if you're trimming for a long time and you're tired of
[20:20.900 --> 20:24.260]  just using one type of scissor, use something with a curve on it.
[20:26.660 --> 20:32.500]  It's kind of a nice way to switch things up. Also, the spring in here is not as robust as
[20:32.500 --> 20:37.460]  the spring for the Fiskars. It's not going to like hurt your hand as much to do that squeezing,
[20:38.180 --> 20:46.020]  that squeezing motion. Hey man, rare, if you don't want this, you can leave. This is what
[20:46.020 --> 20:52.020]  we're talking about. We're talking about scissors. And then the other ones that I really
[20:52.020 --> 20:58.900]  like are the Chikomasas. The reason why Chikomasas are nice is because they don't have a spring in
[20:58.900 --> 21:07.460]  it because you can really feel the material. I like that. Like you can actually feel the
[21:07.460 --> 21:13.380]  butts as you're trimming them. You can feel it in your hands and you don't get that spring back on
[21:13.380 --> 21:31.870]  your hand. And yeah, that's just, I like these. Let me, yeah, if you keep screwing around rare,
[21:31.870 --> 21:38.350]  I'm going to block you. So yeah, I really like these, but I don't know if you guys will know,
[21:38.350 --> 21:46.030]  but that this is actually a scissor for a female's hand. And it doesn't particularly
[21:46.030 --> 21:54.750]  fit my hand that well. They have bigger ones that have, that have a straighter,
[21:55.790 --> 21:58.750]  it's straighter right here. It's not a curve, it's straight. And then it goes down. It's kind
[21:58.750 --> 22:03.710]  of a triangle and those ones are meant for men's hands. And I like those ones better
[22:04.590 --> 22:15.550]  and they work really well. So yeah, I think people should be very aware of various scissors
[22:15.550 --> 22:28.270]  that are around because yeah. And this, is this a infomercial? I mean, I'm not selling anything.
[22:28.270 --> 22:32.350]  I don't work for Chikomasa Fiskars or any of these brands. This is a show about,
[22:32.910 --> 22:36.590]  you know, this one particular is focused on land-raised breeding, but it's a cannabis show.
[22:36.590 --> 22:41.870]  And so we're going into the various aspects of harvesting. So one of those aspects is scissors.
[22:43.230 --> 22:47.310]  And because I used to work at a hydro store, I had the opportunity to try all different types
[22:47.310 --> 22:54.510]  of scissors and, you know, I've used these for 15 plus years. Never, ever once tried anything else,
[22:54.510 --> 22:58.350]  but you know, if you're working at a hydro store, you get a chance to try all the different scissors
[22:58.350 --> 23:06.270]  and, you know, play with them for hours. And, you know, I think for outdoor, these are really
[23:06.270 --> 23:10.670]  a good choice. And, you know, if it's a man that's using them to use the ones that have the
[23:11.310 --> 23:20.030]  little, it's more of like a triangle and less of a circle. So, yeah, I think that,
[23:20.190 --> 23:26.190]  sorry, I lost my train of thought, but let me keep going. Oh,
[23:28.350 --> 23:32.590]  this is the other one. It's important that you have these, you know, when you're cutting branches,
[23:32.590 --> 23:36.350]  when you're cutting thick stuff, you want to have something that has, you know, that sharper,
[23:36.350 --> 23:42.590]  that has, it's able to cut a, like a thicker branch. This is also important because if you
[23:42.590 --> 23:46.510]  use your smaller scissors to cut the thicker branches, it will make them dull and it can
[23:46.510 --> 23:52.830]  break them. So you want to have probably something, maybe even a little bit thicker than this,
[23:52.830 --> 23:57.790]  then you want to have these, and then you want to have probably at least one or two pair of these,
[23:58.750 --> 24:07.710]  at least. And those are really good tools to have to, to have a successful harvest.
[24:08.350 --> 24:12.750]  And, you know, there are people who have been doing, you know, like for me, for example,
[24:12.750 --> 24:23.230]  like I've been doing this since 2001, 2002, so 20 years. So yeah, you know, like my hands don't
[24:23.230 --> 24:28.110]  trim as well as they used to, and I, you know, I need the correct tools to get these things done
[24:28.110 --> 24:31.790]  right. When I was younger, I could have used these for the, I can use these, I could do whatever,
[24:31.790 --> 24:43.690]  but as you get older, you need the correct tools to get the job done. All right, so, oh, and then
[24:43.690 --> 24:47.210]  another thing I would say is the Chikamasu is an excellent scissor. It's just a really good
[24:47.210 --> 24:52.650]  quality scissor. It's Japanese made. You can, I think, even get these re-sharpened.
[24:56.410 --> 24:59.850]  Oh, so Peter's asking how do you clean my blades? You're rid of them from potlait and virus and
[24:59.850 --> 25:04.250]  those kind of things. I mean, honestly, I would buy brand new scissors and use them
[25:04.810 --> 25:14.010]  just for cloning. I would not use these kind of scissors for taking clones. And in reality,
[25:14.010 --> 25:22.010]  what I like to use is my kitchen cooking scissors to take clones. I don't like to use my trimming
[25:22.010 --> 25:26.970]  scissors to take clones anymore because they're just too dirty. I would rather, I feel a lot more
[25:26.970 --> 25:33.450]  comfortable using scissors that I cut paper with, that I cut chicken with or anything like that. I
[25:33.450 --> 25:42.170]  feel more comfortable using those scissors to cut my clones than scissors that have been used to
[25:42.170 --> 25:53.050]  cut countless plants and countless gardens. Yeah, that's how I do it. Do I wash my buds?
[25:53.050 --> 25:59.690]  That's a really good question. It really depends. It depends. So, like years when there's lots of
[25:59.690 --> 26:06.970]  fires, I definitely wash my buds. In general, I don't wash my buds if it's a good year just
[26:06.970 --> 26:13.130]  because it takes a lot of time and I haven't really seen a huge difference between ones that
[26:13.130 --> 26:18.890]  were dipped in water and ones that weren't. When I wash plants, when I do wash them, I definitely
[26:18.890 --> 26:26.090]  see a lot of dirt in the water. So, that is the thing. But I also have noticed I see a layer of
[26:26.090 --> 26:34.250]  some kind of oil on the top as well. So, I don't know if that oil was terpenes or if that happens
[26:34.250 --> 26:42.010]  to be some residue that was left on the plant from some spray. I don't know. But I do notice that
[26:44.650 --> 26:49.930]  when you do wash the plants, there's definitely some sort of oily sheen on top and you also do
[26:50.010 --> 26:56.890]  have a fair amount of dirt. If I do dip my buds, I would usually do at least two different
[26:56.890 --> 27:01.770]  containers. So, I'd have one container that I would dip that would have, let's say, sometimes
[27:01.770 --> 27:06.810]  I would try like citric acid in there. Other people would do like a lemon basically. Other
[27:06.810 --> 27:11.530]  people... That's what I was... Yeah, diggy. That's what I was worried about is that it's terps,
[27:11.530 --> 27:18.410]  that oily layer. So, sometimes I'll dip... I've heard a little bit of baking soda.
[27:19.930 --> 27:24.490]  Mostly I would do just like a water and a water. So, you dip once in water and then you dip another
[27:24.490 --> 27:29.130]  once in water again and then you would hang it and you'd notice that the first one you dip in
[27:29.130 --> 27:34.330]  gets really dirty. The second one gets dirty less quickly and then you can kind of dump the dirty
[27:34.330 --> 27:41.130]  one and kind of keep cycling over. If you're harvesting and it's really hot, that's a time
[27:41.130 --> 27:48.090]  actually when I would dip my buds. And my thinking is that if you were dipping your bud, there's this
[27:48.090 --> 27:52.890]  extra layer of water that's evaporating that's keeping your plants from as many terpenes
[27:52.890 --> 27:58.170]  evaporating. So, yeah, when it's super hot, past years it's been crazy hot.
[27:59.530 --> 28:06.730]  Harvesting in the 80s and 90s and in those situations I would also dip my
[28:06.730 --> 28:12.410]  buds before I would hang them. Another technique if your environment is too dry, which is something
[28:12.410 --> 28:18.170]  I learned from my boss at Berkeley Greener Garden, was to hang wet towels next to your plants.
[28:19.050 --> 28:24.090]  Because in certain places like here in California, Northern Cali, it's been super dry. There's not a
[28:24.090 --> 28:29.450]  lot of water. I'm sure maybe places like Colorado, I'm assuming it's pretty dry as well. And if you
[28:29.450 --> 28:35.690]  don't have the... I don't know if you're not going to add a humidifier to your room, taking towels,
[28:35.690 --> 28:42.650]  dunking them in water, and then hanging those as well in your drying garage is another way to
[28:42.650 --> 28:47.690]  basically add more humidity to your room. So sometimes when the humidity level was really,
[28:47.690 --> 28:56.330]  really, really low, I would have buckets of water sitting in the room with the drying plants. It's
[28:56.330 --> 29:04.530]  because things are drying so quick. Yeah. Yeah. It's because things are drying super, super quick.
[29:05.250 --> 29:09.010]  Hey, Peter, would you like to come on? I'm not sure.
[29:11.730 --> 29:13.410]  Yeah. Let me know if you'd like to come on.
[29:16.770 --> 29:20.770]  What's this person been saying? I've never washed my buds on an indoor grow and never washed
[29:20.770 --> 29:28.450]  anything from an outdoor grow. Yeah. I mean, it's like some people swear by it. Definitely
[29:28.450 --> 29:32.850]  there's dust on your plants and there's dirt. It depends on where you are.
[29:36.920 --> 29:41.880]  Yeah. I'm sorry, Peter. Let me know if I should let you in or not. Yeah. I just don't know.
[29:43.480 --> 29:45.320]  But yeah. Hey.
[29:48.680 --> 29:54.920]  I was just jumping in for backup. Oh. Oh, no, no. I'm good.
[29:56.200 --> 29:59.080]  Yeah. Just to help with the technical production.
[29:59.880 --> 30:01.880]  Okay. Okay. Awesome. Should I put you back on the...
[30:02.840 --> 30:08.520]  I can. Okay. Cool. Cool. Awesome.
[30:13.220 --> 30:17.220]  Okay. Somebody just said, I've never heard of that. Yeah. I mean, basically it's like,
[30:17.220 --> 30:22.580]  for example, if you were growing somewhere where there's a lot of dirt around, like,
[30:22.580 --> 30:28.100]  you know, if you're growing out in Mendo in the country, people are riding like ATVs or trucks
[30:28.100 --> 30:32.820]  back and forth along the path, you know, things like that. A lot of dirt gets kicked up. So,
[30:32.820 --> 30:37.460]  like, you know, in situations like that, it's really good to, you know, to dip buds.
[30:37.460 --> 30:41.540]  And there are also people who makes, you know, like RSO oils and things like that,
[30:41.540 --> 30:46.580]  that it sounds like they are really into dipping nugs. I don't know if that's something that Nick
[30:46.580 --> 30:50.660]  is into. Nick, definitely chime in on the, you know, on the chat if that's something that you're
[30:51.300 --> 30:55.700]  terroir. You're washing off the terroir. That's funny.
[30:59.060 --> 31:03.780]  But yeah, I don't know, like, for obvious, if you're making bubble hash, for sure, maybe people
[31:03.780 --> 31:09.940]  might be, you know, dipping their buds. But yeah, that's, you know, that's kind of my take on that
[31:09.940 --> 31:24.180]  one. All right. So, yeah, we're gonna now move on to, we're gonna make, I'm gonna go on to making
[31:24.260 --> 31:29.060]  an edible today. And I think we missed last week's, I was, you know, I was doing the solo show.
[31:29.700 --> 31:33.380]  But today we're going to make an edible, the edible that we're making. Okay, so,
[31:33.380 --> 31:39.940]  let's back up. So, on each show, I wanted to make one simple edible that you could put together
[31:41.300 --> 31:45.060]  on a whim, that you can put together, you don't have to plan, because that's the one thing about
[31:45.700 --> 31:51.300]  edibles that's kind of a drawback is that you have to make the oil, make the butter,
[31:51.300 --> 31:56.420]  make all these things before and then infuse, you know, infuse the butter and then make that
[31:56.420 --> 32:02.340]  into a product. And, you know, as stoners, a lot of us don't have that much planning
[32:02.340 --> 32:07.780]  to decide to make something like that. So, at least for me, often when I want an edible,
[32:07.780 --> 32:12.900]  I just wanted at that, at that time, I'm like, I want an edible. And I didn't happen to make
[32:12.900 --> 32:21.350]  something. Nick is saying, is this week's edible gonna have cannabis in it? Yeah, actually, this,
[32:21.350 --> 32:25.910]  this week's edible is gonna have cannabis and I'll eat it on screen and all that. So, this week's
[32:25.910 --> 32:34.790]  edible is going to be ganja mole. So, what is ganja mole? Ganja mole is guacamole with ganja
[32:34.790 --> 32:42.070]  added. So, the first time I did this, I used bud and ground up some bud, made some guacamole,
[32:42.070 --> 32:48.870]  it was decent. Then the second time I did, I used keef. And that's where the magic came in.
[32:48.870 --> 32:57.990]  It was super, super, what's the word? It almost tastes like garlic in there. It's really flavorful.
[32:58.710 --> 33:07.190]  And yeah, it's super flavorful. It's really unique. It's very easy, which is, you know,
[33:07.190 --> 33:09.990]  which is the purpose of, you know, which is the point is you want to have something that's super
[33:09.990 --> 33:18.390]  easy that you can just, you know, you can just make whenever you'd like. So, you know, I'm going
[33:18.390 --> 33:23.830]  to tell you guys how we make it and then we're going to make it and then we will all eat it.
[33:23.830 --> 33:27.670]  You can even use this to make, you know, like avocado toast. My wife was like, don't,
[33:28.950 --> 33:35.350]  don't do avocado toast because avocado toast is sliced avocado, not, you know, guacamole mash on
[33:35.350 --> 33:41.670]  toast. But yeah, you know, you could do, you can, whatever you want to do with that, although
[33:41.670 --> 33:46.950]  that's how you, you know, that's what we're going to do. So, yeah, basically you have alba, you have
[33:46.950 --> 33:53.670]  your Keith, you have salt and you have your citrus, a lime or lemon, you mix them up and boom,
[33:53.670 --> 34:01.110]  you have a guacamole. It is not decarbed. And some people will be like, well, if it's not decarbed,
[34:01.910 --> 34:05.910]  do you feel it in the same way? And the answer is no, you don't. You definitely do not feel in the
[34:05.910 --> 34:11.830]  same way. You can eat a lot more. Yeah. And like what Alex is saying, you know, raw THC is medicine.
[34:12.310 --> 34:17.750]  Um, it's really good medicine for your gut. It moves all that THC around your stomach,
[34:17.750 --> 34:27.510]  around your intestines and your colon and all of those things. Um, so yeah, and it doesn't
[34:27.510 --> 34:34.390]  get you as high so you can eat more of it. And he said, you won't feel nothing. Um, you know,
[34:34.390 --> 34:38.150]  I would argue you definitely do feel something. It gives you this really interesting head rush.
[34:38.790 --> 34:44.790]  Um, especially when you're doing it with Keith and, you know, some people claim that it, um,
[34:44.790 --> 34:54.230]  decarbs in your stomach, but it's cool because, um, it's a different way to eat weed. And, you
[34:54.230 --> 35:00.790]  know, I'm all for as many different types of ways to eat the weed as possible. Um, because, you know,
[35:00.790 --> 35:06.070]  I'm a stoner and that's just how we do. So we're going to move over to the kitchen for
[35:08.470 --> 35:13.030]  the show. And then we got Aladdin coming on in about 20 minutes.
[35:15.430 --> 35:27.580]  All right. All right. So yeah. Give me a shout if you guys are not able to,
[35:29.740 --> 35:33.740]  you know, if I'm not explaining anything or if you can't see anything, just give me a nice shout
[35:34.060 --> 35:39.180]  in the chat. So we have our Alva close this.
[35:44.220 --> 35:53.900]  All right. So we got our Alva, got our lime, got some Keith and
[35:54.780 --> 36:01.420]  we've got some brand new salt.
[36:10.040 --> 36:12.840]  Here, I'm curious if you guys want to put out in your chats,
[36:14.360 --> 36:16.440]  um, what your guys' favorite edibles are.
[36:19.160 --> 36:22.200]  Oh, let me wash my hands first. I'm not a sick individual.
[36:22.760 --> 36:36.830]  You know, it's funny because I used to watch some of those other,
[36:39.630 --> 36:43.470]  used to watch some of those other like weed cooking shows. And I was like, that's not a real
[36:43.470 --> 36:49.430]  weed cooking show. Who knows? Maybe you guys are watching this one and you're like, this is not a
[36:49.430 --> 36:57.670]  real weed cooking show either. But yeah, this has got a bomb avocado. Juice about that.
[36:58.310 --> 36:59.350]  Juice about that.
[37:02.310 --> 37:11.230]  Take my Alva. And
[37:14.430 --> 37:16.430]  all right. So as far as dicing,
[37:19.390 --> 37:23.470]  let's see how much Keith I should put on. I think I'm good.
[37:29.690 --> 37:33.130]  And honey, can you please open this salt for me?
[37:35.210 --> 37:40.490]  Thanks. All right. So the magic ingredient, I got some Keith here.
[37:41.610 --> 37:45.530]  Um, so I was like last year's outdoor Keith that was basically just in the trim band.
[37:46.730 --> 37:55.860]  Um, and yeah, I'm just gonna put some Keith in here. I don't know. It looks like maybe
[37:59.820 --> 38:01.500]  half a gram of Keith at least.
[38:01.500 --> 38:13.250]  You don't have any chips to eat today. So I'm just gonna have to eat it with a straight tortilla,
[38:13.250 --> 38:22.100]  but I'm okay with that. Just do flour.
[38:24.500 --> 38:26.100]  Put it into a bigger bowl.
[38:29.220 --> 38:33.540]  I mean, I know you guys kind of get the picture. It's not easy. Most people here know how to make
[38:33.540 --> 38:36.320]  guacamole.
[38:38.400 --> 38:38.960]  Yeah.
[38:38.960 --> 38:57.290]  Make sure I don't mess this up on camera. Well, I don't know how to work this. Oh, here we go.
[38:58.250 --> 39:11.620]  Salt grinder. All right. So the moment of truth. It's it's have to have been at least five years
[39:11.620 --> 39:18.420]  or more since I've had any guacamole. It's got salt, citrus,
[39:20.180 --> 39:22.020]  and it's got a little bit of a kick to it.
[39:22.020 --> 39:24.020]  All right. So let's try this.
[39:26.500 --> 39:30.980]  Mmm. That's delicious. I'm gonna be savage and put in the rest of the Keith.
[39:40.020 --> 39:40.580]  Mmm.
[39:45.510 --> 39:46.010]  Mmm.
[39:48.550 --> 39:49.050]  Mmm.
[39:52.990 --> 39:53.490]  Mmm.
[39:56.510 --> 39:57.010]  Mmm.
[40:00.990 --> 40:05.290]  Hella good. Oh, man.
[40:11.010 --> 40:11.510]  So good.
[40:15.250 --> 40:16.450]  I forgot how good that was.
[40:19.170 --> 40:24.530]  So yeah, that's how you make guacamole. Super easy.
[40:26.770 --> 40:27.490]  Super simple.
[40:27.650 --> 40:31.570]  Honestly, I don't taste the Keith in there that much.
[40:34.850 --> 40:37.330]  Yeah, I don't really taste the Keith in there that much.
[40:38.850 --> 40:41.650]  Let me see if I can get a bigger bite that has more Keith in there. But
[40:43.250 --> 40:49.090]  it's really good. I would highly recommend you guys try it. Yeah. Yeah, Chad. I mean,
[40:49.650 --> 40:55.490]  it's super easy. And I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie.
[40:55.490 --> 41:01.090]  It's super easy. And I mean, it's delicious. I mean, you know, one thing, keep in mind,
[41:01.090 --> 41:04.930]  you want to make sure that you do label things like my child was while I was making that my
[41:04.930 --> 41:11.250]  child was like, ooh, guacamole. No, it's not gritty at all. It kind of is like adding garlic
[41:11.250 --> 41:20.550]  powder to your mix. Yeah. Okay. A little bit of Keith in there. But you don't get the plant
[41:20.550 --> 41:29.900]  material taste. Not the secret. Excuse me. When you make an edible very often.
[41:31.980 --> 41:39.260]  There's plant material taste. There's like the green taste. And I don't like that people don't
[41:39.260 --> 41:45.980]  like that taste. But with this, it's more of like a THC taste on the back end. So like once you eat
[41:45.980 --> 41:50.380]  it, you're like, not only taste it, and then swallow and you're like, hmm, you start getting
[41:50.380 --> 42:02.300]  these like puffs of like THC I guess is what it is. That's good. Now keep in mind, it totally
[42:02.300 --> 42:06.620]  depends on the style of the type of Keith that you use. So like, on this last taste right in
[42:06.620 --> 42:11.180]  the end, I was like, I can taste a little bit of the old Keith taste to it. And I don't like that
[42:11.180 --> 42:20.300]  as much. But if you have something like sour, amazing, fresh sour Keith. Amazing, amazing,
[42:20.300 --> 42:29.340]  amazing. The last time I made I used sour Keith, and it had the best, best, best flavor.
[42:31.660 --> 42:35.260]  Yeah, and the aftertaste you do taste a little bit of, you know, a little bit of something so
[42:35.260 --> 42:40.140]  you know that there is weed in there. And I like that. The reason why I like that is so that you
[42:40.140 --> 42:44.620]  know that there is weed in it. So that people aren't eating things that have weed in them and
[42:44.620 --> 42:51.020]  have no idea. Yeah, I like that. You know, and of course, you know, if you're using different
[42:51.020 --> 42:55.820]  types of Keith, they're going to add different flavors to it. I really like sour. I said that
[42:55.820 --> 43:02.540]  before. Yeah, I mean, sour is probably my favorite. You know, this stuff is pretty good. And this Keith,
[43:02.540 --> 43:07.500]  like I said, has been in my trim bin for months and months and months, probably like five months.
[43:08.380 --> 43:14.300]  So, you know, still, still extremely delicious. Extremely, extremely delicious.
[43:16.700 --> 43:21.420]  So yeah, let's jump into our Landrace type conversations now. I know I've been,
[43:21.420 --> 43:27.100]  you know, kind of stringing you guys along. I told you, you know, today's Landrace show.
[43:28.220 --> 43:33.660]  And I haven't been talking to you in Landrace yet. So let's, you know, let's get into, let's dive
[43:33.660 --> 43:39.420]  into why, you know, I know that people love, you know, people come on to listen to Landrace breeding
[43:39.420 --> 43:50.860]  topics. So enough of the, enough of the other stuff. Let's jump in. So I grew some Congolese
[43:50.860 --> 43:58.060]  by 88G13 from Bodhi seeds this year. And those seeds were gifted to me by Grasshopper, who was
[43:58.060 --> 44:06.060]  supposed to come on, but is working today. So I apologize for that. So I have two buds. So here is
[44:06.060 --> 44:13.660]  the first one. So this is the Congolese by 88G13 from Bodhi seeds. And yeah, I mean, it looks like
[44:13.660 --> 44:29.480]  it's mostly 88G13 is what I would say. And then here is another pheno of it. And, you know,
[44:29.480 --> 44:36.280]  the smell it gives, it has kind of like that acrid smell to it, but it's not over the top.
[44:36.280 --> 44:45.720]  It's very mellow, kind of like, very calming kind of mellow vibe to it. It has what I would say is
[44:45.720 --> 44:50.520]  like flea market smells like people I don't know if any of you guys go to like your local flea market.
[44:51.160 --> 44:57.320]  We have one in Berkeley. And the smells of the flea market is often what I smell from this. So
[44:57.800 --> 45:04.200]  you'll smell like incense, or you'll smell people, smell like the smell of people who wear oils,
[45:04.200 --> 45:11.160]  not cologne. And then it's the oils mixed with like a little bit of must. And then you also smell
[45:11.960 --> 45:18.200]  like a little bit of like wood and kind of like I would describe it as like beads,
[45:18.200 --> 45:27.080]  like wood and beads and like those types of things. And, you know, I mean, shoot for a
[45:27.080 --> 45:33.400]  Congolese hybrid, it's very, very dense. And I'm assuming that most of that has to do with 88G13
[45:33.400 --> 45:41.720]  in there. But still, you know, all the phenos were extremely dense. They finished fairly early,
[45:42.280 --> 45:48.760]  and they were all pretty uniform. One of the things I really like about it, I mean, it's like,
[45:51.560 --> 45:58.840]  it has a nice modern, you know, somewhat type of modern look to it for, you know, for to,
[45:58.840 --> 46:07.480]  for basically a, you know, Congolese landrace by a hash plant. And, you know,
[46:08.040 --> 46:14.600]  you know, this year, this was probably the most, the most wild genetic that I that I grew.
[46:16.360 --> 46:22.360]  I'm almost kind of starting to lean more towards heirloom and a little less towards landrace. I
[46:22.360 --> 46:31.800]  find that the landrace are extremely unworked. And one of my biggest tools and how I,
[46:32.360 --> 46:36.920]  excuse me, how I decide what I'm going to continue to grow the next year is what gets smoked.
[46:37.560 --> 46:43.400]  And often a lot of my landrace things from last year did not get smoked, and I had a lot of them
[46:43.400 --> 46:48.840]  left. And so that's what's kind of having me lean a little less towards those ones that are super
[46:48.840 --> 46:54.120]  unworked, and more towards heirloom, which is based. So basically, a landrace is something
[46:54.120 --> 47:00.600]  that's like very close to wild. So like, let's say like an apple, and I'm like, okay, I'm going to
[47:00.600 --> 47:06.680]  say like an apple, you guys have had like a, they call it like a crab apple, a crab apple tree.
[47:06.680 --> 47:12.520]  It's wild, you take the apple seed, you plant it, it grows, that's kind of what you get. And that,
[47:12.520 --> 47:17.080]  in my opinion, is similar to what a lot of landraces are like. It's like a crab apple. It's
[47:17.080 --> 47:25.640]  very, very resilient, resistant, drought tolerant, it doesn't need to be staked up as much,
[47:25.640 --> 47:33.000]  those types of things. And to get it to go from that crab apple stage to a regular
[47:34.920 --> 47:41.160]  crisp Granny Smith, or whatever, is a fair amount of work. Yeah, like what Chad is saying,
[47:41.160 --> 47:47.000]  people romanticize about landrace genetics. It's just a lot, it's a lot of work. And
[47:48.840 --> 47:53.320]  when you work with something as opposed to something that's an heirloom, where it may
[47:53.320 --> 47:59.240]  already have been worked a little bit, it's still quite different from what we are working with.
[47:59.240 --> 48:07.320]  It still has those different genetics, but it maybe is not a wild cultivar. It's been cultivated,
[48:07.320 --> 48:14.200]  it was once wild, but now it's been cultivated, it's been domesticated. And it's a few more steps
[48:14.200 --> 48:20.200]  closer to what people, to what we're looking for. Because what we're looking for, I would say is not
[48:20.200 --> 48:26.440]  even as much like a Granny Smith apple, but it's more of like, what are those dogs called?
[48:27.160 --> 48:35.240]  Like a bully dog. One of those like little designer dogs that are super cute and have the like
[48:35.240 --> 48:42.440]  smashed face. That's kind of what the cannabis community is looking for in weed. You know,
[48:42.440 --> 48:49.480]  or those designer strains, those designer, the labradoodle of cannabis. That's what people want.
[48:49.480 --> 48:55.320]  And when you have like a straight wolf or a fox, and you want to breed that wolf or fox all the way
[48:55.320 --> 49:03.000]  to the labradoodle, that's a fair amount of work to be done. And you could spend years doing that
[49:03.000 --> 49:09.080]  and not be successful. Because I mean, you're, it's literally just like, you know, you're trying
[49:09.080 --> 49:13.000]  something and then you see what happens. You know, you make a cross and then either it works or it
[49:13.000 --> 49:18.360]  doesn't work. And you just keep going on from there. So for me, I've been leaning a little bit
[49:18.360 --> 49:24.520]  more towards heirloom varieties, which, you know, are still, they still have that different factor
[49:24.520 --> 49:29.560]  to it. You know, there's still not, there aren't any heirlooms here in California, cookies, and
[49:29.560 --> 49:36.200]  none of that stuff is heirloom or sour. None of that is heirloom. So, you know, that's kind of
[49:36.200 --> 49:41.240]  what I've personally been doing, you know, with our, you know, with our seed club, we got a pack
[49:41.240 --> 49:49.000]  or a couple packs of the Beluchistan via Red Scare Seeds, shout out to him. But that's from
[49:49.000 --> 49:56.280]  Indian Land Race Exchange. And, you know, as a group, we chose to work with that because that is a,
[49:56.280 --> 50:03.240]  you know, that's a farmed heirloom. They don't consider that a land race. It's been farmed,
[50:03.240 --> 50:11.080]  but it's been farmed in Pakistan, you know, and that family has been selecting and farming that
[50:11.080 --> 50:19.960]  particular variety for who knows how long. And so, you know, that's kind of the tip, and that's
[50:19.960 --> 50:25.320]  the trend of where I'm going to be looking to work with some of these, you know, heirloom varieties
[50:25.320 --> 50:31.560]  from other places in the world. Also, what I thought was pretty interesting is, shoot, it must
[50:31.560 --> 50:37.560]  have been like a month after we had purchased those genetics, there was a flood in Pakistan. So
[50:38.040 --> 50:43.800]  I think that region was okay. But I mean, that kind of goes into the
[50:46.360 --> 50:50.680]  necessity that it is important to save these seeds. It's not just the thing of like, yeah,
[50:50.680 --> 50:55.880]  we're geeks, we want to save a million seeds for, you know, the Armageddon and all that kind of
[50:55.880 --> 51:00.840]  stuff. Like, no, a lot of these regions, you know, there are all different kinds of things that are
[51:00.840 --> 51:07.400]  happening throughout the world, whether they're manmade or natural, but it is important for us
[51:07.400 --> 51:12.600]  to have these seeds, because perhaps, you know, that area could have flooded, and those varieties
[51:12.600 --> 51:17.880]  could have been lost. And, you know, only the people who had those particular packs purchased
[51:19.000 --> 51:25.000]  would be the only ones with those genetics. So, you know, in those types of situations,
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.640]  it's great to be able to have those genetics to perhaps send them back to those people when their
[51:29.640 --> 51:39.720]  situation improves. But yeah, you know, saving those seeds, and breeding with those seeds,
[51:39.720 --> 51:44.520]  and holding value in that is important. It's not just important for you to have
[51:45.240 --> 51:51.080]  your heady or whatever, but, you know, so that we could perhaps send them back to them in the future,
[51:51.080 --> 51:56.760]  that we could perhaps, you know, make new things, you know, let's say there are certain kinds of
[51:56.760 --> 52:03.160]  diseases, or blights, or droughts that happen where people have bad crops those, you know,
[52:03.160 --> 52:09.560]  particular years. Being able to have those genetics in different places is extremely important.
[52:10.760 --> 52:16.920]  I, you know, I have a seed club, or a seed collective that I'm a founding member of,
[52:16.920 --> 52:22.920]  and one of the biggest reasons why I started this club is because I used to think, man, imagine if
[52:22.920 --> 52:28.440]  I started this club 10 years ago, how cool would it have been to have all the different varieties
[52:28.440 --> 52:33.400]  that I was working with 10 years ago? That would have been awesome. All these things that now are
[52:33.400 --> 52:41.000]  considered, you know, super rare and special that back then it was not really, just wasn't really
[52:41.000 --> 52:46.440]  that special. It wasn't that important. Like, for example, headband. You know, headband 10 plus years
[52:46.440 --> 52:51.640]  ago was just something that you could get wherever. And from my recollection, we stopped growing
[52:51.640 --> 52:58.200]  headband because we would just grow sour instead, just because it yielded more. But now it's like,
[52:58.840 --> 53:07.160]  sour is very common. Headband, not common, you know, kind of difficult to find.
[53:18.780 --> 53:25.260]  But yeah, yeah, yeah, Peter, I would love to have Alex come on. I'm sorry it took me so long to get
[53:25.340 --> 53:34.220]  onto this. But yeah, he's totally welcome to come on and talk Landry's. So yeah, you know,
[53:34.220 --> 53:38.620]  I would encourage people. Yeah, you know, like it's funny because like,
[53:39.420 --> 53:46.300]  when headband was totally around, from my recollection, it was cool. But it wasn't,
[53:49.260 --> 53:53.020]  you know, I guess it's like when you have things around, they're not as special. So like headband,
[53:56.140 --> 54:01.020]  yeah, like when it was around to me, it wasn't like something super, super special, hard to get.
[54:01.020 --> 54:06.540]  It was just a finicky clone. That's to me what I remember. Headband was a finicky clone that
[54:06.540 --> 54:12.940]  didn't yield a lot. And sour was more consistent and yielded a lot. And they both got the same
[54:12.940 --> 54:18.860]  price. So headband kind of just went by the wayside. Another one actually that they replaced
[54:19.660 --> 54:26.940]  headband with was called Casey Jones. And Casey Jones grew in a very similar way, which was,
[54:27.580 --> 54:35.580]  it was Casey Jones, sour diesel, train wreck and tie. And, you know, the Casey Jones grew much
[54:35.580 --> 54:42.860]  better. It was more consistent, it yielded better. It wasn't as good of a product, but
[54:43.660 --> 54:48.380]  it didn't really matter. And so the Casey Jones and the sour diesel kind of pushed away the
[54:48.380 --> 54:55.420]  headband. Now headband is considered awesome. But back then it was just kind of like, you know,
[54:55.420 --> 55:01.580]  one of many. But you know, I'm sure that's the same as like now I bet if cookies disappeared
[55:02.700 --> 55:08.140]  and or gelato disappeared, I bet you a lot of people would really be into cookies and gelato.
[55:08.140 --> 55:15.020]  Cookies and gelato. This person is talking about, you just hit a dozen purebred cashmeres.
[55:15.740 --> 55:21.580]  Oh, with the purebred starfighter. Yeah, I worked with the cashmere. I actually worked with the
[55:22.940 --> 55:34.460]  cashmere Congolese. Yeah, cashmere Congolese ADAG 13. I like the Congolese ADAG 13. This one better
[55:34.460 --> 55:40.780]  than when there was also cashmere mixed into it. But I felt like the high when there was also
[55:40.780 --> 55:47.980]  cashmere mixed into it was very interesting. And I'm trying to think of what the word is,
[55:48.540 --> 55:56.860]  it's like very dreamy and kind of different. And it was very, yeah, it was kind of like
[55:56.860 --> 56:04.060]  dreamy in a cool way and really allowed you to kind of like daydream. That's how I would really
[56:04.060 --> 56:10.060]  describe like for me what the cashmere brought into it is it brought in some like kind of
[56:10.060 --> 56:18.140]  daydreaminess to it. You know, that year was actually a terrible year for growing. That was
[56:18.140 --> 56:23.340]  when I grew that one. That was the year when there were three days of darkness. And so it
[56:23.340 --> 56:30.620]  definitely didn't come out to you know, nearly its potential. But you know, it was definitely
[56:30.620 --> 56:35.420]  interesting. I like this one better. You know, perhaps it was the year was just a better year.
[56:36.620 --> 56:41.260]  But yeah, you can definitely both you can get both of these from Bodhi. This Congolese by
[56:41.260 --> 56:48.700]  ADAG 13. The other one is the Congolese cashmere by ADAG 13. You know, they're both they're both
[56:48.700 --> 56:55.980]  really good plants. You know, another side thing. So here's my volcano trim, or volcano shake if you
[56:55.980 --> 57:00.940]  know if I wanted to get you know, super high I could dip this into my ganja mole. And you know,
[57:00.940 --> 57:05.580]  you can use this kind of stuff, you know, the same way that you would use key for anything else to
[57:05.580 --> 57:13.340]  to infuse your products. So yeah, I'm thinking I want to kind of smoke some of this I can
[57:13.900 --> 57:22.620]  tell you guys how it be. But yeah, okay, what's this person saying pretty fat sad when you finish
[57:22.620 --> 57:30.220]  the headband? It was a true love. Yeah, Kemi. Yeah, I would almost like like my recall of the
[57:30.220 --> 57:40.140]  headband is it was almost like it's almost like a like a sativa. Almost like a sativa OG. In a way
[57:40.140 --> 57:46.540]  it's like the plant like the like I recall it was like kind of like a like very stocky type of plant.
[57:46.540 --> 57:53.580]  And there were definitely a lot of red hairs or brown hairs on the headband that I remember. And
[57:53.580 --> 57:59.980]  it was it grew. Yeah, that's what I recall. It was kind of like a one stock type of thing is
[57:59.980 --> 58:08.380]  what I'm thinking in my mind. I mean, Jesus was so long ago. But yeah, it was, it was really
[58:09.820 --> 58:14.940]  interesting how you know, stuff goes out of style, people kind of people kind of want it more.
[58:17.500 --> 58:20.780]  Yeah, here I'll show you guys this is some bubble gum.
[58:25.060 --> 58:28.260]  Not Landrace, but you know, I guess you consider the old school now.
[58:33.790 --> 58:42.910]  Here's some bubble gum. This is from Adam Dunn. Really interesting as one. This one came out
[58:42.910 --> 58:48.110]  killer. Yeah, bubble gum. This is from Adam Dunn. So I guess the th seeds bubble gum,
[58:48.990 --> 58:58.030]  one plant. And you know, I'm lucky I kept a clone of it super stony. And, you know, really tasty
[58:58.030 --> 59:05.550]  has has that really nice old school chronic taste that a lot of people like. The only thing is that
[59:05.550 --> 59:12.350]  it does not taste like bubble gum. So I'm a little bit torn. Like it's fire. It has a really good,
[59:12.350 --> 59:17.790]  you know, weed tasting flavor, but I'm a hesitant. I'm hesitant to call it bubble gum,
[59:17.790 --> 59:24.750]  because when people smoke bubble gum, they really want that bubbly, bubblicious flavor. And
[59:27.470 --> 59:33.550]  it doesn't have it, but it definitely is good. Definitely has a really good chronic flavor.
[59:34.350 --> 59:38.430]  But you know, I think I should probably not smoke the bubble gum because that'll make me
[59:39.310 --> 59:48.190]  too boring. I should smoke this Congolese ADAG 13. We'll have Aladdin coming on in a few minutes.
[59:48.190 --> 59:57.790]  We'll get into talking about what he's doing. But yeah, you know, this ADAG 13 or Congolese by ADAG
[59:57.790 --> 01:00:02.590]  13, I would definitely recommend, you know, growing this or any, you know, any hybrids,
[01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:10.750]  you know, with these types of things in it. It was a really, it was an enjoyable grow.
[01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:14.910]  You know, that's what I would definitely add. It was a very enjoyable grow. It was an easy grow.
[01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:23.550]  The Congolese ADAG 13 had very, very little powder mildew. It had very, very little bud rot. I was
[01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:29.550]  extremely hesitant to say anything about that while the plant was growing to not jinx myself.
[01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:35.950]  But you know, now that it's done, had very little caterpillar damage as well. So, you know,
[01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:40.510]  I'm curious, people in the chat, how was your guys' caterpillar, excuse me, your caterpillar
[01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:45.870]  damage this year? I know a lot of people got hit really hard this year with caterpillars.
[01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:49.550]  And it seems like every year people are getting hit harder and harder with caterpillars.
[01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:55.710]  You know, initially we would have people spray in like August, you know, when their plants would
[01:00:55.710 --> 01:01:00.430]  transition into flowering, when the hairs would first start coming out. That's when everybody
[01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:06.350]  would start spraying with BT. And we would, you know, we would tell people once the buds started
[01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:11.950]  to fill out, you didn't need to spray any BT because the caterpillars couldn't get into the
[01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:18.590]  buds and any caterpillar that was already inside of the bud, the spray wasn't going to get into them.
[01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:27.550]  But what we've noticed is that the caterpillars are adapting and they're starting to eat the
[01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:34.510]  trichomes and they're starting to come out later and later and later to the point of where I still
[01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:43.390]  have little caterpillars coming onto my plants now. Now there's another interesting, I guess,
[01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:47.870]  phenomenon or whatever. You've been picking caterpillars for the past two days, Peter.
[01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:54.670]  Gosh. Another phenomena, at least at my house, which has really helped me this year, is that I
[01:01:54.670 --> 01:02:01.070]  have a fair amount of wasps and I've noticed that the wasps have really been patrolling my plants.
[01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:07.150]  And I have a theory that they've been eating a lot of the caterpillars because I just haven't
[01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:14.110]  had as bad caterpillar issues as a lot of people that I've talked to. Another thing is, you know,
[01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:20.350]  if you always are having problems with caterpillars is to grow more sativas. And there's
[01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:25.870]  two reasons that the sativas kind of are the foe of the caterpillar. So one is there's an open bud
[01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:31.790]  structure. So like the bud is a little less round. It's more kind of open and there's more
[01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:41.390]  nodules and super nugs. It's open. And so there's not as many places for those caterpillars to hide
[01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:48.030]  inside of the bud. And so what I find is that when they can't hide inside the bud,
[01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:56.190]  one, the wasp can eat them. And two, if you have any damage,
[01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:01.390]  it tends to... Okay, so there's two different things. So one, you want to have an open
[01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:07.870]  bud structure. Two, with your sativas, you also have space, inter-nodal spacing. So you have
[01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:16.830]  space in between those nodes. When you have space in between the nodes, if one bud is compromised,
[01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:23.230]  you know, if one bud rots, it doesn't spread to the bud below it. And if all the buds are touching,
[01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:28.510]  it's very easy. For one, the caterpillar, because it kind of nibbles on the stem and keeps kind of,
[01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:33.230]  you know, walking around in a circle, keeps going down and down in the bud. And you can see the
[01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:41.470]  little poop trail going down. If you have a little bit more stem in between, the caterpillar
[01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:47.230]  only goes to one bud. It might kill that one little bud, but it doesn't... I don't ever see
[01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:53.230]  the caterpillars crawling down the stem then to the next bud set and then trying to damage that.
[01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:58.990]  They usually kind of stick where they have that protection around them. So when you have space
[01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:06.910]  in between the buds, it allows you to keep your plants up more. You don't have to spray as much
[01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:13.950]  BT. And if you have some caterpillar damage, it stays in a specific area. It doesn't spread.
[01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:18.670]  And that's super important. Super, super, super important. So for example,
[01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:23.950]  I have my haunalei selections that I've been working that are, you know, grasshopper's
[01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:29.870]  genetics. He gifted me. I have two different, two phenos that I've been working with. One of the
[01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:36.270]  phenos has nice spacing between... I'll get into what BT is in a second. One of them has really
[01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:42.270]  nice spacing between the nodes. And yeah, you know, I'm getting caterpillar damage. They're kind of
[01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:48.750]  munching on the little bud. And, you know, once they munch on a little bud, you'll find that that
[01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:56.430]  bud will often kind of die. And what you want to happen is hopefully that bud to die and it to dry
[01:04:56.430 --> 01:05:02.430]  out. And if it dies and dries out and that kind of that one little section kind of is dead and it
[01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:07.870]  doesn't stay moist and continue to spread to the whole bud. And that's really what you want to
[01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:12.590]  watch out for. And that's the main issue with those caterpillars is not only does the little section
[01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:21.230]  where they eat die, but it can mold the whole rest of the bud that's really good. So you want
[01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:32.750]  to... so that's why when you have your sativas, you have, you know, bud, stem, bud, stem. If
[01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:38.190]  the bud dries, you still have the bud below it that's still good and the bud below it that's
[01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:46.910]  still good. Also, if the bud is dry, you can harvest it. You don't have to necessarily get
[01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:54.110]  rid of that bud because it's already dead. That's super important. If you have rot that's wet,
[01:05:54.110 --> 01:05:59.950]  you have to remove that before you dry it because it's easy for that to spread to the rest of the
[01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:09.390]  bud. But if it's dry, you can just cut the branch, hang it, that little piece is not going to spread
[01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:16.990]  to the rest of the plant. My homie Dalton on the feed, he was talking about how if he sees
[01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:23.470]  caterpillar damage, he'll let his plant get a little extra dry so that those bud sites will die.
[01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:29.950]  And then he can kind of identify the dead bud sites. He can remove them if he wants and then
[01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:36.910]  he can rehydrate the plant and have the plant keep living. You know, these are
[01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:43.150]  techniques that people learn from, you know, process of elimination from experience of
[01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:49.870]  screwing up harvest. That's kind of, that's just how it goes. And another thing
[01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:55.630]  for indoor people, I know there are people who are in this right now who are like,
[01:06:55.630 --> 01:07:00.030]  well, I'm an indoor guy, none of this information pertains to me.
[01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:08.990]  You can get caterpillars indoors. And people are like, excuse me, Jamal, you can't get caterpillars
[01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:14.030]  indoors. You definitely can get caterpillars indoors and you can get them indoors, especially
[01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:24.350]  during this time of year. And I worked on indoor plants where a few moths somehow managed to find
[01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:32.030]  their room into the room. Once that one moth, you know, found itself into that room, we were
[01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:42.430]  pulling, you know, worms and all that kind of stuff out of indoor buds. So, you know, I forget
[01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:48.350]  who it was, but somebody asked, what is BT? BT is Bacillus thuringiensis. And it's a bacteria that
[01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:54.670]  people will spray on apple trees, people will spray on cannabis, people will spray on edible
[01:07:54.670 --> 01:08:02.270]  crops. And it's a bacteria that kills certain types of caterpillars. And it kills the caterpillars
[01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:09.470]  from a white apple, what they call the cabbage moth or apple moth. And, oh, this person,
[01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:13.710]  Connor is saying, yeah, his buddy got caterpillars indoors for the first time last year.
[01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:18.350]  Yeah, it's super crazy. Because I mean, it's like, they just have a field day and there's no BT in
[01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:27.550]  the indoor grow. But, you know, if you're coming inside, you know, if you're going in and out of
[01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:33.470]  your grown room in certain ways and your room isn't, you know, immaculate, if it's not a,
[01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:38.670]  you know, a sealed environment, it's not a bad idea to maybe spray with, you know, a spray of BT
[01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:48.750]  or two. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Chad's talking about had caterpillars, you notice poop falling a trail.
[01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:55.950]  Yeah, it's a bummer. It's, yeah, it's, you know, you want to, you really want to address that.
[01:08:56.590 --> 01:09:01.390]  And I mean, really, the only way is through, just through BT, you know, the other way. Hey,
[01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:07.070]  Khalif is on. The other way you can do it. What's up, guys? How's it going?
[01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:15.390]  Yeah, pretty well, man. So first of all, thank you very much for the invite. I really appreciate
[01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:21.070]  it. Yeah. And I hope that you know, you guys can all hear my son right now because he's next to me.
[01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:26.830]  I have to look after him. So he's watching TV right now. Can you hear the TV or is it okay?
[01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:32.030]  Yeah, we can hear it a little bit, but it's no, I mean, no worries. I got a two year old daughter.
[01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:40.510]  So, okay. Yeah. I'll try to move away from it a little bit. Yeah. I mean, you know, this is what
[01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:48.270]  it is, you know? Yeah. Sorry about that. Yeah. So yeah, man, I just wanted to say thank you for
[01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:55.150]  coming on the show. Actually, the first time I was on a podcast talking about cannabis was when James
[01:09:55.150 --> 01:10:02.750]  Loud invited me on with you. That was awesome. I remember it. Yeah. And I'll be honest. I was a
[01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:08.430]  little bit intimidated because I was like, dude, these guys are both some OGs. Like, you know,
[01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:16.270]  Jamal, come correct. But dude, you're super friendly and you know, I'm glad we get to have
[01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:22.110]  another conversation. Thank you. And yeah, and James, you know, he's been around for a long time.
[01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:26.510]  So I was a little stressed out as well, you know, cause it's a big thing, you know,
[01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:32.750]  but yeah, he's pretty cool. So he's very friendly as well. So it's easy to talk to him.
[01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:39.470]  Hell yeah. So my first question for you is how long have you been making podcasts? Cause I have
[01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:45.550]  seen your podcast. I mean, my memory's terrible, but I remember watching your podcast for quite a
[01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:51.870]  while. Okay. Are you talking about the YouTube videos that we have on the channel or are you
[01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:57.550]  about being a guest on somebody else's podcast? No, the YouTube videos on your channel. Okay. Yeah.
[01:10:57.550 --> 01:11:03.710]  So we've done it. I think I've been doing it for about three years, maybe three and a half at most.
[01:11:03.710 --> 01:11:10.510]  Okay. Not that much. Interesting. I thought I'd seen you make videos for years.
[01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:15.550]  No, less than four years for sure. Jeez. Okay. Well,
[01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:20.430]  and then my next question for you is what are you smoking on these days?
[01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:28.910]  Wow. Right now. I like the, the more Rocky and lane race. Okay. It's like, it's not very
[01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:35.630]  pointed. I don't know if you've tried it before. Have you? Yeah, I have. Okay. So it's very mild,
[01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:40.590]  but it kicks in very quickly. You know, you feel the effect after just about five seconds,
[01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:47.630]  maybe 10 it's super quick. And I like it cause it makes you focus. It helps you focus more
[01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:55.630]  on whatever you're doing. So it's not very strong, but you feel it and it puts you in a great mood
[01:11:55.630 --> 01:12:02.110]  and it makes you like, it allows you to focus even more. So it's great to like work, to be active,
[01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:08.430]  to work out, even to chill, but it doesn't like, it doesn't knock you out, you know?
[01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:12.910]  Yeah. So I kind of like it. Do you mix it? Are you, are you a split guy?
[01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:20.110]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I, so I was, I was in Amsterdam and, um,
[01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:25.950]  geez, this was a long time ago, but yeah, there's, you know, Moroccan hash, Afghani hash,
[01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:31.310]  all different kinds of hash there. And I noticed, um, when I smoked the Moroccan hash,
[01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:40.430]  I tasted a lot of terroir in there. I tasted like, like, he's almost like pine needles type of thing.
[01:12:40.670 --> 01:12:49.070]  Um, that's kind of what I got from it. You know, like I'm, you know, I was in a different country,
[01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:54.750]  you know, other side of the world, but definitely like, that's, you know, I'm a, I'm not a split
[01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:58.750]  smoker. So we were like taking bong rips of Moroccan hash, but that's really kind of what
[01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:06.670]  I got from it was like, um, there's a lot of pine needles and, um, yeah, it was solid. I mean,
[01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:12.110]  like you said, like it wasn't crazy, wasn't crazy strong, but it was good.
[01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:19.710]  Yeah, definitely. Cause like the hash you make yourself with some like top quality genetics,
[01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:28.590]  I mean, it's easily like 40%, 45, 50% THC, like easily, but the hash you get in like Amsterdam
[01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:37.150]  in the coffee shops is probably around 20%, 25% of most. And there's like a combination of many
[01:13:37.150 --> 01:13:42.910]  other cannabinoids as well, you know, cause it's not just THC. If it's made with like
[01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:48.910]  land-raised strains, if it's like some Afghan hash or Moroccan hash, it's going to have CBD as well.
[01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:55.150]  It's going to have other secondary cannabinoids as well. Right. So it's not as strong, but it's
[01:13:55.150 --> 01:14:01.470]  very medicinal. Would you say that the plants are maybe grown a little like longer? Like, uh,
[01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:09.950]  you know what I mean? Like, sorry. No, go ahead, man. Go ahead. Sorry. I was going to say to me,
[01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:17.710]  it felt like, I mean, this is just my assumption, but I'm assuming that the trichomes are picked
[01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:24.670]  at a later date. Like they're more ripe than what we might, you know, harvest, what we consider like
[01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:29.150]  peak harvest, you know what I mean? And it's a bunch of different plants all mixed together.
[01:14:29.150 --> 01:14:35.710]  Right. So it's not like, that's right. Kind of like the average terpenes of all of these
[01:14:35.710 --> 01:14:43.310]  different plants put together. Yes. So to answer your question, I would say yes, but it depends on
[01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:50.510]  where it comes from. I would say Afghanistan and Pakistan. Definitely. I was doing an interview
[01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:57.550]  of a strain hunter from Pakistan about a month and a half ago. And he told me that the farmers
[01:14:57.550 --> 01:15:04.590]  over there usually wait for the snow or the frost before they harvest their plants. So it's very
[01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:10.190]  late, you know, because allegedly it makes the hash better, you know, it changes the quality
[01:15:10.190 --> 01:15:15.870]  and makes it better. So in Afghanistan and Pakistan, they tend to do that often. Uh,
[01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:22.030]  even in Lebanon, I think they're doing the same thing. So yes, but in Morocco, they typically
[01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:28.350]  harvest a little bit too soon. You know, it's very dry and hot over there. The summer is dry and hot
[01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:35.390]  and they're like, they have to produce huge amounts of hash because they export a lot of it.
[01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:43.310]  So typically they harvest too soon. So it's actually the opposite in Morocco, but Afghanistan,
[01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:49.790]  Pakistan, Lebanon, and probably Northern India. I'm not sure, but probably I would say yes.
[01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:58.510]  Interesting. Um, and so in Morocco, they harvest early. Do they make their hash
[01:15:59.390 --> 01:16:03.230]  in the winter time or do they just basically harvest it once it's dry, just start making it
[01:16:03.230 --> 01:16:10.030]  until all year? So, yeah, it's usually harvested early and then it's dried on the rooftops,
[01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:15.790]  you know, rooftops of their houses because it's very hot in full sun. It dries them up real quick
[01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:20.750]  and then they make the hash, but they can make it gradually. They don't make everything at once.
[01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:28.190]  Okay. The winter might be a little humid then. So it's usually before the winter,
[01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:34.190]  but yeah, in the fall, I would say like it's, it's, they do it for at least a couple of months.
[01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:40.110]  So they start, I think they start right after once it's dry, but it's a slow process because
[01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:46.350]  they have to just sieve everything themselves with like small screens and stuff. So it takes a long
[01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:52.030]  time to do it. They do it gradually, you know, they space it out. And do they, I mean, like I've seen
[01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:59.630]  my, my knowledge on Moroccan hash making is, is basically whatever is on YouTube, right? Like, do
[01:16:59.630 --> 01:17:04.670]  they still use like the, like the drumming with the sticks, like that type of traditional hash
[01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:12.190]  making? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. They still do it, but in some areas they're, they're doing things the,
[01:17:12.190 --> 01:17:18.670]  the modern way now. So they still do it in most areas, but now it varies according to the area
[01:17:18.670 --> 01:17:24.030]  because some have like some very like high end gear and they do it the same way they do it in
[01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:31.470]  California. So it really varies according to how much money they have, the area, the know-how,
[01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:39.950]  you know. For sure. And then like, I recall that there was a difference between with them with
[01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:47.710]  hash and keef and that keef was considered like a lower end product compared to hash.
[01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:54.430]  Yeah. Yeah. So what they call keef in Morocco is not what you call keef in America.
[01:17:55.070 --> 01:18:01.390]  So the keef in Morocco is actually the flowers, you know, the flowers that, but not any flower.
[01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:07.950]  It's just the, the bildia, the local landrace's flowers, you know, that's what they call keef.
[01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:14.910]  And it's usually full of seeds. It's not trimmed or very roughly trimmed. That's what they call
[01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:20.590]  keef. And they smoke it with a long pipe. It's, it's, it's kind of like their tobacco over there.
[01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:26.990]  You know, they like to smoke it very often. It's very, very mild, you know, it's sun dried,
[01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:32.030]  it's roughly trimmed, it's full of seeds. So yeah, it's, it's low quality, but that's what
[01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:38.910]  they've been smoking traditionally for a long, long time. Then before they started making hash
[01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:47.230]  in the 60s or 70s, everyone, everybody in Morocco that would smoke weed, that would consume cannabis
[01:18:47.230 --> 01:18:53.310]  would actually smoke the keef. You know, they only have that local landrace, the bildia,
[01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:59.310]  and they would not make hash with it. They would just harvest and dry the flowers and then smoke
[01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:07.310]  them. Interesting. With seeds in it? Yeah, they just pick them, but there's always going to be a
[01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:12.910]  couple of seeds. The taste is a little rough too. Interesting. And then you said in the 60s,
[01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:18.830]  they started making hash and expanding. Yes, exactly. We're not doing that before.
[01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:25.390]  So Morocco is not a hash country. It's a cannabis country. They've been growing that local landrace
[01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:33.150]  for at least 800 years. Some people say up to 2000, up to 2000 years, but we don't know for sure.
[01:19:33.150 --> 01:19:39.230]  It's hard to tell, but yeah, they've only been making hash since the 60s. So it's very, very new.
[01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:45.150]  Interesting. Where do you know where they got their hash making techniques from? Because I mean,
[01:19:45.150 --> 01:19:51.630]  they seem like fairly old school and traditional. Yeah. So some people say the hippies taught them
[01:19:51.630 --> 01:19:59.790]  how to do it. Hippies, like they brought some gear with them and they taught the locals how to make
[01:19:59.790 --> 01:20:06.350]  hash. So that's what the legend, well, that's what people say. That's what the rumors say.
[01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:11.710]  But I mean, there's no way to know for sure, but it's likely to be the case.
[01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:19.150]  Interesting. And then how about like in Pakistan and Afghanistan? Are you familiar with how people
[01:20:19.150 --> 01:20:24.830]  make hash there? Is it different from in Morocco? Yeah, definitely.
[01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:35.310]  Yeah. So, I mean, it's mostly dry sift as well, but some people in Pakistan hand rub just like
[01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:43.550]  in India and the sieving technique is not the same. So I'm not extremely familiar with it, but
[01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:50.030]  it's much bigger, you know, the screens are bigger and the way it's sift is not the same.
[01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:55.790]  They're using big screens there like they're trying it like properly sometimes, you know,
[01:20:55.790 --> 01:21:00.910]  in the dark or sometimes they just wait for the winter to come and then they harvest.
[01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:09.070]  And so that the trichomes are like easy to detach. They're easy to break off, you know, but yeah,
[01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:15.470]  it varies according to the region because there's many different tribes, many different ethnic
[01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:20.110]  groups and they don't like they don't do it the same way everywhere.
[01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:29.070]  That makes sense. Gosh, I was just gonna. So when I was in Amsterdam, and this could definitely be
[01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:35.790]  an overgeneralization, what I observed was that the Moroccan hash seemed to be like blonde and
[01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:46.510]  drier in that the Afghani was blacker and more like a gooey. Okay, so that's true in some areas,
[01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:54.910]  Afghan hash can be very dark in Pakistan as well, usually in the north. But it also depends,
[01:21:54.910 --> 01:22:02.030]  you can get some blonde Afghan hash and some blonde Paki hash as well. The Moroccan hash is
[01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:08.110]  usually like chocolaty, blonde chocolaty, you know, slightly brown, but not not very dark.
[01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:15.310]  And what you said about the texture, you know, it's not sticky in Morocco, like real Moroccan
[01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:24.110]  hash is not sticky. And that's because the trichomes are very, very small. The trichome
[01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:32.910]  heads that the local landrace produces are much smaller. It's likely to be because
[01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:40.510]  it's a hybrid, the local landrace is a hybrid between some European hemp strains and some
[01:22:41.230 --> 01:22:47.950]  hash, you know, hash landraces, hash strains coming from the Middle East a long time ago.
[01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:54.670]  So hemp strains usually produce smaller trichomes. So that could be the reason.
[01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:59.950]  However, what's for sure is that the local landrace in Morocco, the Badiya,
[01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:06.830]  always produces small trichome heads. And because the trichomes are so small,
[01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:11.390]  the hash is not sticky. It's different, you know, it's very dry, it's chalky.
[01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:19.070]  And that was super interesting. That's a wealth of information right there.
[01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.750]  Thank you.
[01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:30.830]  Um, shoot, okay. Is it possible that the reason why the Moroccan landrace trichome heads are
[01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:35.310]  smaller is because it's harvested earlier? Or do you think they're just, they're smaller in general?
[01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:46.030]  I mean, it's the strain for sure. It's the variety. But the fact that they harvest earlier,
[01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:48.590]  that also plays a part. I think so. Yeah.
[01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:51.630]  Interesting. It's super interesting.
[01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:58.110]  Because it's sun dried, you know, because it's sun dried, also, it might change the texture also,
[01:23:58.110 --> 01:24:03.070]  you know, because it like it degrades a little bit because of the sun, the strong,
[01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:07.230]  you know, sun rays probably do something to the resin also.
[01:24:07.230 --> 01:24:13.150]  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, I mean, it was interesting how you're describing it.
[01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:17.470]  Like that's basically like your go to daily smoke is the...
[01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:24.430]  Oh, cool. Alex Hardy's Badiya. Interesting.
[01:24:25.230 --> 01:24:27.710]  Um, yeah.
[01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:39.640]  My brain is, I'm having a brain fart. I'm sorry. Okay, so...
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.400]  Okay, so yeah, we're talking about trichome heads.
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:50.680]  Okay, yeah.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:54.680]  Tell us what you're growing right now. What are you working on? What kind of strains
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:55.560]  are you working with?
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:59.560]  So I'm working on is a really cool Hawaiian lion.
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:01.000]  Wow.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:07.960]  It was gifted to me by the other person, Grasshopper, who's part of my seed company.
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:17.480]  It's he got it from Hanalei. And what I looked through about 40 seeds. And what I found was
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:25.880]  um, there's Guava phenos and a few outlier train wreck terp ones in there.
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.080]  Nice.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:32.360]  But you know, in California, honestly, train wreck has a really bad name.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.600]  So those are kind of the ones that I'm steering away from. But the Guava phenos
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:45.960]  were good, were really nice. Very open bud structure. I found one that has an indica
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:50.760]  dominant, you know, but still has that same Guava flavor to it, which is really interesting.
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:59.080]  And then there is another one, which I think is more Colombian leading. So it's a really nice,
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:05.560]  like, big sativa, you know, nice open bud structure, really nice colors.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:15.000]  Really, you know, has that Guava flavor to it. And for me, the coolest thing is that it's done
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.400]  now. You know, I was expecting these plants to maybe go in the other month or so, but they're
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:28.520]  done. You know, mid October, which is early, which is super, super early. You know, like, I mean,
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:33.320]  I had to ask the guy that gave me the seeds, you know, if I should even cut them down,
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:39.320]  because I was assuming that they would just go much, much faster. But you know, I have this
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:45.800]  Colombian pheno that's really nice. I have this more hybrid pheno. They're both, you know, have
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:51.960]  that Guava thing to them. And I would kind of describe it as like, I don't know if you ever
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:59.400]  smoked Island Sweet Skunk before. No. The Sweet Skunk? Yeah, but the Island Sweet Skunk. Yes,
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:04.360]  like Sweet Skunk type of thing to it. So it's like Skunky has the sweet thing, but it's like,
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:15.320]  fruit. Yes, fruity. Yeah, definitely. It's like fruity and danky. And it's fruity, it's dank,
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:21.400]  and it's very potent. You know, I would describe the potency similar to like Blue Dream.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:29.560]  Which is something, I mean, honestly, I don't particularly, I prefer smoking things that
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:35.240]  have a different high to it. Because for me, if I smoke Blue Dream, it gets me really high, hungry,
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:41.160]  sleepy type of thing. You know, kind of like it gets you all the types of highs.
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.520]  And I, you know, like you're saying, I like to smoke all day, you know, smoke all day.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:56.360]  But it's a really nice, dreamy high and it has a really dank, you know,
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:03.800]  is it energizing? Does it make you energetic also? Or is it like cerebral? Or is it mostly
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:11.960]  a body high? It's cerebral, cerebral, but it makes me kind of spacey. Okay, okay.
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:19.320]  Because what I would say, it makes me a little spacey. Very potent, very potent and
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:27.640]  and spacey. And I mean, honestly, for me, often the sativas that are potent are harder for me to
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:32.920]  handle than the indicas that are potent. Because the indicas that are potent, it's more straightforward.
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:39.720]  It's like, I'm high in a way and I know it. Like with the sativas, you know what I mean? You're not
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:44.600]  really sure if you're high. You know, you kind of like run into something and you forget something
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:50.360]  and you're like, oh shit, I'm high. Okay. Absolutely. You know, so like for me, it's kind
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:58.040]  of like a lot of times the flavors that I like, the high from those is not the same as the high
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:07.880]  that I like. So often like the high that my body likes is a very bland flavor. That makes sense.
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:14.680]  So like the things that I should smoke to get the most done would be like, probably similar to like
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:22.200]  Moroccan hash. Where it's not as loud of a flavor, but the high is a little bit more consistent.
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:31.400]  Yeah. Other things like it just smashes me and I'm like, I'm high. I just want to like watch TV.
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:38.360]  You know, if I got to watch my kid, you know, I'm like facing out and not focusing on her
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:47.160]  sometimes. You know, so like, you know, it's a great strain, but I'm a little torn. You know,
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:51.560]  I don't want to be like, it has everything. It's the best high. It's the best flavor. It grows
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:57.960]  amazing. It's like, it's awesome. But for me, the high gets me a little too.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:05.880]  Yeah. So, you know, that's, you know, that's what I'm working on, but I mean, it breeds pretty true.
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:10.920]  And you know, what I'm learning from this round, which is really interesting
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:15.480]  is that it's a very consistent breeder, but there's also a little bit of train wreck.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:24.200]  And some of the train wreck is very nutty and almost kind of one of the plants tastes
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:32.120]  smell like peanuts. And for the California market, people don't like that. And I think
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:37.080]  maybe it's going to go so out of style that it'll eventually go back into style. But for now,
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:45.240]  you know the train wreck turps make me a little bit worried. But also what I've noticed is that
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:51.720]  a lot of strains that have train wreck turps, if they have a little bit in it, it's okay. Because
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:57.480]  if there's a little bit of turp, turpidilene kind of works as a accelerator of flavor.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:04.440]  But if there's too much of it, it kind of overpowers almost like salt or bacon type of
[01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:13.880]  Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. I feel like it's not possible, or they're unlikely to find
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:18.440]  something that has everything. There's always going to be a trade off. You know, it's like,
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:24.440]  oh, this strain is freaking awesome for this. You know, it's got that. But I mean, maybe the
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:30.600]  color's not there, or the density is not there. There's like, there's always going to be one
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:37.960]  thing, you know, like when you try to breed and select for something very specific, it's not
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:42.120]  going to have it all, you know, it's going to have that one thing that you like, but you're
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:46.360]  going to have to leave out some of the stuff that's good, you know, because it's extremely
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:53.800]  hard to like, inbreed something, make it like breed true for something, and still maintain
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:58.120]  everything, you know? For sure. And I mean, that leads me to my question with you is,
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:03.880]  I'm very curious about your breeding of the, was it lemon blanco?
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:11.960]  Like we started with the Afghan lemon, which was a pure Afghan landrace, pure Afghan cultivar.
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:18.760]  And what we do is, you know, when we do a reproduction run, we work with a lot of plants
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:26.120]  to preserve the genetic diversity. And when we do that, we find, you know, sometimes we find
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:32.920]  outliers, you know, very special plants that we like a lot. And that was the case with that one,
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:40.440]  you know, we found that lemony, very beautiful, very dense indica like plant that we decided to
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:47.560]  stabilize, you know, to turn into an IBL so we could use it like pure and also use it for
[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:55.640]  breeding, you know, as a tool to create other strains also. That's awesome. Does that lemon
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:33:02.120]  blanco, how's its veg? I'm sorry, I'm going to turn down the volume right now. Sorry.
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:08.920]  Okay. All right. What did you say? Could you say it again?
[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:13.800]  I was going to ask you, how is the vegging, how's the structure and vegging and like vigor
[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:19.400]  of the Afghan lemon blanco? Yeah, it's definitely, it's very bushy, you know,
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:25.960]  it's got big leaves, like not all Afghan strains do that. You know, there's a lot of narrow leaf
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:34.760]  Afghan varieties and phenos. It's a myth that all Afghan strains are like super bushy,
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:41.320]  very dense with like wide leaves. Not all strains do that. You can find some plants that do it,
[01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.880]  that would display these traits, but not all plants would.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:55.080]  Interesting. And does this one, so basically my theory is that there's some linked traits
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:34:02.440]  and that some of the linked traits are the lemon flavor and the like very bushy plants that grow a
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:09.640]  lot of nodes very close to the stem. Which for me also ends up being a lower vigor plant because
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:15.000]  it ends up growing too many nodes and the nodes that it's growing are not on the plant, but kind
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:23.880]  of more on the inside. Yeah, like it's great to use it as a tool to out cross it because,
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:31.240]  you know, it's very leafy as with most hash strains. As with most hash plants, it's very leafy
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:38.600]  and bushy, so it's not easy to trim. It's not very photogenic. It doesn't look too good because it's
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:43.480]  very leafy, so it's hard to get a good picture. You know when it's full of leaves and you get like
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:49.880]  a little bit of flower here, but it's like covered with leaves all around, you know,
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:57.240]  you can't really see the buds. But it's got one trait that's very good. It's the stems. You know,
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:05.000]  the main stems are very hard, very thick, very sturdy. So when you out cross that with a plant
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:13.880]  that's a little lanky, that's a little weak, it'll strengthen it a lot. Interesting, very interesting.
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:19.960]  And it has a lemon flavor to it as well? Yeah, yeah, it's pretty dominant. So that's what we
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:25.400]  noticed, you know. At first, not all plants, you know, when we started stabilizing that strain,
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:31.880]  not all plants would produce lemon turps. But after a couple generations, it became consistent.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:40.120]  And now when you out cross this strain, I would say about 80%, if not more, of the plants,
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:45.720]  you know, among the offspring would produce these lemony turps. So it's very interesting.
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:51.080]  That's killer. And do you guys like delete heavily? Or do you like with those?
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:59.080]  So I'm definitely not a big fan of that. I feel like it's more popular in America.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:09.320]  But with like, you know, very bushy Indica's, I like to do it. Yes. With sativas, I don't even do
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:15.160]  it at all. Like we don't ever do that. With hybrids, maybe a couple of leaves here and there,
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:20.280]  when they're blocking the lights, or when they're growing maybe too close together, or,
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:25.400]  you know, you can do it a little bit slightly. With Indica's, you can do it more definitely.
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:31.320]  So I would say the more Indica like the plant, the more you can deleaf. What do you think? What
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:37.400]  are your thoughts? Oh, no, I completely agree. I mean, I'm actually the same, you know, for years,
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:41.720]  I would see people remove any fan leaves, it would just hurt my heart. I would never,
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:48.600]  never. I mean, that's just not what we did. The more,
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:57.400]  more commercial bud. Yes, we pull off tons and tons of fan leaves. And the more commercial
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:02.840]  facilities, I'll see people pulling off tons and tons and tons of fan leaves.
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:10.280]  Also, when working with those strains that are so Indica dominant, from my experience,
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.440]  the more fan leaves I pull off, really, the bigger the buds actually get.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.440]  That's right. It's very counterintuitive, because when I first learned it was like the fan leaves
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:27.880]  are the solar panels. And that's what powers the plant. It seems like some of these varieties,
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:33.960]  if you don't pull off those fan leaves, you end up getting one really, really huge bud and the
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:41.240]  rest are so tiny. We're also noticing for us that you can't get any, your penetration of your
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:48.680]  foliar spray is very limited with those families. Oh, yeah. You know, like, me, I have a lot of
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:54.200]  issues with spider mites with the plants that have fan leaves, you know, because the spider mites
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:38:05.080]  are hiding in those little crevices that I can't get to. So I do pull a lot of fan leaves from those
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:12.200]  Indica plants. And I would probably never take a picture on Instagram of those plants,
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:18.280]  because I would be embarrassed with how they look. But the buds come out how they need to.
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:24.280]  And I do notice that when you don't do that, I'll get bugs that are too big. And actually,
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:30.280]  with I'm a mainly an outdoor guy, we don't want bugs that are too big. We actually want them to
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:37.880]  all be like medium, smaller size. So I will pull off a lot of fan leaves to keep the buds smaller.
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:47.000]  And yeah, IPM is not as much of an issue outdoors also, because there's so many natural predators.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:54.120]  And the cold nights in the fall, it also kills a lot of pests. So it's not as big of a problem,
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:39:01.080]  usually, as indoors when everything is dialed in. But you don't have that many predators,
[01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:07.160]  the environment is like perfect for pests. So if you get some pests into your indoor garden,
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:12.840]  then it can it can like really get out of hands. So yeah, like you said, do you leave thing indoors,
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:16.520]  it can really help, you know, you can spray the plants more effectively.
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:23.800]  Yeah, and I mean, you know, I also think it's very variety specific, because like what you were
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:30.120]  saying, like the plants that have the thin leaves, you don't pull off any of the leaves. Yeah, like,
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:35.320]  I love that, because that tells me then I know that I'm going to get a deep canopy, right,
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:39.080]  that you're going to get the buds that are really low in there and are still nice and
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.120]  that's really something that I want, especially as an outdoor guy. You know, I want my leaves to
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:48.920]  ideally be as thin as possible, because you get as much light penetration, really deep into that
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:56.200]  canopy. And I mean, spray penetration, whatever, you know, airflow as well, because like, you know,
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:02.200]  in Cali, we get a lot of powder mildew issues. Yeah. Like one of my buddies in the chat, you
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:09.560]  know, he de-leafed super, super hard, pruned off way harder than I ever would, but he did not have
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:16.600]  any PM issues, you know. And so I was like, okay, like you pruned harder than I would, but you don't
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:23.480]  have any PM, I'm fighting PM, you know, point taken, you know, it's a note in my head. I mean,
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:29.080]  it's crazy, like you said, like in Cali and in the States in general, people are pruning harder and
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:36.920]  harder and harder. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like there's a sweet spot, you know, when you do it a little
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:43.880]  bit with most strains, it can bump up your yields a little, you know, that's for sure. If you do it
[01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:49.160]  a little bit, you know, if you know how to do it, you can get more lights, you know, more light that's
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:54.040]  like, that's hitting the buds. And like you said that the leaves are the solar panels of the plan,
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:59.720]  that's true. But if there's like a leaf on top of a leaf on top of a leaf is not needed, you know,
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:05.720]  to have that many. So I can definitely increase yields a bit, but there's a sweet spot. And once
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:11.160]  you like delete too much, then you start losing yields. You know, you start losing on yields.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:16.680]  And also, I mean, like, I definitely tell like some varieties like certain things, you know what
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:22.760]  I mean? Over others. Yeah. You know, because some stuff when you would do that, it just doesn't,
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:29.000]  it just doesn't, it doesn't respond. But I mean, most of the stuff that I've been,
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:35.880]  oh, Alex Hardy, he's a heavy... No, no, no. This is some Thai stuff that's just starting to flower
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:46.610]  down here in SoCal. Very narrow leaf. Just starting? Oh my gosh. Do you do any, any outdoor?
[01:41:47.410 --> 01:41:54.500]  Or you're indoor only? I'm sorry, you're asking, who are you asking? I'm sorry.
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:59.060]  Do you do any outdoor? Or are you indoor? Oh yeah, we do both. Yeah.
[01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:07.220]  Oh cool. Yeah. We like to breed for like mold resistance also. So we would like plant things
[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:13.860]  like too late on purpose to help the plants, you know, finish very late. That way you can really
[01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:20.580]  pick the ones that can withstand the humidity and not mold as much as the other ones. So yeah,
[01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:26.820]  we like to do that too. You know, we like to, to like develop strengths for outdoor growers
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:31.700]  and some other strengths for indoor growers. But like, it's not like all the same, you know,
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:38.180]  we would like maybe say this one has been like developed especially for outdoor growers. And
[01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:44.900]  that one is great for indoors, you know, so yeah. For sure. What's an example of something
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:49.860]  that you're breeding for outdoors? Okay, the Aladdin skunk, for example, the skunk
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:57.060]  is like it's an old school skunk, but it's mostly sativa. Sativas tend to withstand mold better.
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:04.500]  And it's mostly sativa, but it's early flowering. So that's very good for outdoors, you know,
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:11.460]  it'll finish early and it'll withstand like the humidity. So it usually doesn't mold much.
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:16.740]  But then we like we take it, we like to take it to the to the extreme, you know, to plant it late
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:24.500]  to really pick the individuals that will not mold. It's already like mold resistant, but we'd like to
[01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:30.980]  really pick the best ones to work on, you know, outdoor strengths to then have that as breeding
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:36.980]  tool and out cross it with somebody something else that we like. Do you guys have issues with
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:44.740]  caterpillars? In Spain, it's a big problem. Yes. Yes. Interesting. So if you're not careful,
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:49.860]  you can lose your whole crop like very quickly. So BT is very useful. You know,
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:55.780]  you've heard of it, I guess. Oh, I mean, we just had the same conversation before you came on. So
[01:43:56.100 --> 01:44:02.980]  okay. How about powder mildew? Not really, not that much. A lot of botrytis.
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:10.980]  Mildew not that much. PM is not an issue here. And when does the season, like quote unquote,
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:15.860]  start to like wind down or end, like start getting like rain when you would like? Yeah,
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:24.740]  it's usually in September. You know, as the days start getting shorter, I'd say mid September when
[01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:30.180]  the plants start to really bloom, then it starts raining a lot and it gets colder. And even when it
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:36.820]  doesn't rain, there's usually a lot of dew in the morning. So it sounds like it's, it's somewhat
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:44.740]  difficult to grow outdoors in Spain. Yes. Yes. So to grow outdoors here, there's like two things
[01:44:44.740 --> 01:44:52.580]  that you can do. Either have some strains that finish early, some like auto flowers, or some
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:58.420]  semi auto flowering varieties, like the ones you can make with the Moroccan lingerie, because it's
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:04.260]  semi auto flowering. So having something that's that will finish very, very early in like,
[01:45:04.260 --> 01:45:10.980]  in the beginning of September, mid September at most, or, or you can breed for mold resistance,
[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:16.980]  and then it doesn't really matter that much. I mean, if you're breeding something for mold
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:23.300]  resistance, it can make it through September, because it's basically just like an open,
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:30.180]  open structure type plant that can handle getting rained on. Yeah. Open structure is usually good.
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:35.460]  You know, like you said, it's usually more resistant. But I've seen some strains that would be
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:41.380]  that were very mold resistant. They were very mold resistant. And yet they had very tight,
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:48.420]  very dense buds. Like the Baba Kush, I don't know why, we grew it outdoors, the pre-98 Baba,
[01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:55.060]  and it was super mold resistant. Although it was very hard. It was rock hard. Maybe because it was
[01:45:55.060 --> 01:46:02.020]  so hard, the water couldn't even get into it. You know, I don't know. Interesting. But it's usually
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:09.140]  better with sativas and plants with open bud structures. And so, like, I kind of wanted to go
[01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:17.060]  back to like, Bel- Bel-dea is what it's called. Is that correct? Yes. Bel-dea. Yeah, yeah. It means
[01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:24.580]  from the country. It means local from the country, you know, from the area, Bel-dea. So,
[01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:33.540]  Spain is in proximity, somewhat close to Morocco. And
[01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:40.500]  how, as far as, what is that, latitude? How is it, how close is it as far as like,
[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:47.940]  distance from the equator? How close is Morocco compared to Spain? Like, are they both similar?
[01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:53.060]  Are they like parallel? Or? No, it's a little, it's a little closer to the equator. It's closer
[01:46:53.060 --> 01:47:03.060]  to it. It's further south. Spain is usually, yeah, it's usually around 35, 37, 38, 40, 40, 40, 40,
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:14.180]  37, 39 degrees north. Morocco, I think it's 32. So, it's closer to it. Okay, but still fairly.
[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:21.460]  I'm sorry. My son is talking to me. Yeah, no worries. You need to go. I can, or, you know,
[01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:25.700]  cut out for a second. I need to. I'm probably gonna have to go. I'm so sorry. We have to do it again.
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:32.180]  Yeah, yeah. No worries. No worries. It's extremely interesting talking to you.
[01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:37.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll keep riffing. It was great to have you on. Please come on whenever.
[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:44.260]  Thank you so much for the invite, Jamal. And if we do it again, I'll try to. Thanks for jumping on.
[01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:51.780]  No, no. No, you're good, man. Take care of your kid. I'm gonna start talking about the stuff that
[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:55.300]  we, we were talking about. Because, I mean, there's still more we can riff on. I just,
[01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:58.020]  I'm just gonna digest what we, what we had to see, what we were talking about.
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:03.620]  Yeah, let's have you on again, man. Thank you so much. Have a great day, guys.
[01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:12.500]  Take care. We'll answer this one next time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So basically,
[01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:21.140]  that was, I mean, that was pretty cool. It was like a crazy wealth bomb of information,
[01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:27.940]  you know, like had his kid in the background, which I totally dig. And, you know, it makes
[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:34.020]  you have to like, even, you know, fight for that info. But what I found, which was super,
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:43.540]  super interesting is, you know, he's talking about breeding genetics to flower in Spain outdoors.
[01:48:44.180 --> 01:48:53.460]  And, you know, I'm ignorant of Spain. You know, I don't know about Spain that much. I've been there.
[01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:57.700]  But, you know, I'm not familiar with the environment. And I did not realize that it was
[01:48:57.700 --> 01:49:03.940]  that difficult to grow outdoors in Spain. And that, you know, the weather, not the season. I
[01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:08.500]  mean, he said the season ends in mid-September, when things are like just starting to flower. I
[01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:17.060]  mean, that's pretty early. And, you know, I just thought it was super interesting how he was
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:23.380]  talking about working in the local Moroccan, not like how we do it, because it'd be cool,
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:32.420]  but just as a literal utility. And that, you know, he's working with the, you know, the material,
[01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:40.020]  you know, the wild material that is close, you know, that has a similar geographic location
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:47.540]  to, you know, to flower out. I thought that was super, super, super cool. I mean, I don't know
[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:51.860]  how if you guys know, but there is, you know, a fair amount of cannabis culture in Spain. I mean,
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:57.540]  there's big cannabis culture in Spain. They, once again, you know, like I've been there
[01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:03.300]  once. I've been to Spain. So I can just tell you about my experience in Spain. It's very close to
[01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:10.100]  Morocco. When you're in Spain, the local people smoke Moroccan hash. That's what they smoke.
[01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:19.860]  They, you know, like it felt very similar to California. I mean, like you could smoke a
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:25.460]  doobie walking down the street and maybe somebody would look at you, maybe not. I mean, they'd
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:31.540]  probably look at you more if it didn't have tobacco in it than if it did. But I think that's
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:38.660]  really cool that how he's working, you know, that he's working Landrace into, you know,
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:42.820]  their strength, not just to make it different and to be different, but just for strictly
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:50.820]  utilitarian purposes. Super, super, super interesting. A little story. I was in Spain
[01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:57.220]  with my wife and we were on our honeymoon. No, it was before that. We were in Spain. And
[01:50:57.460 --> 01:51:03.460]  so I'll tell you guys a little bit about Spain cannabis culture. So like in Spain,
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:08.660]  they have these social clubs. You know, maybe it could be different, but when I went to Spain,
[01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:15.220]  they have these social clubs and, you know, to buy weed. So basically like a cannabis club to buy
[01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:20.500]  weed, you have to be a member of one of these clubs to be a member. I think it costs like a
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:24.180]  hundred euros, maybe a little bit less or something. So it's like kind of expensive.
[01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:27.940]  So like if you're a tourist, if you're a tourist, it kind of sucks because like,
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:34.420]  it's a lot of money for like a week of being able to have the ability to buy weed. But if you're a
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:39.940]  local, you know, I think you pay your hundred bucks and like, you know, you go in for the year.
[01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:44.820]  But anyways, you pay your hundred bucks, you walk into this spot. It's kind of sketchy. It's like a
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:52.580]  little trap door or whatever you walk in. And it's usually like a bar. They have drinks. They have,
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:56.980]  you know, rigs, they have pipes, whatever. And then you go into a little side room. So it's
[01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:05.780]  basically like a dispensary. Here's the interesting part. In Spain, most of the weed is from California
[01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:14.900]  and most of the weed or a lot of the weed that's there is basically light-dip cookies,
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:22.900]  light-dip gelato, whatever. Of course it costs like 40 or 50 euros a gram for
[01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:32.820]  that, but that's what's there. I don't recall smoking much European weed when I was in Spain.
[01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:40.020]  I think I might've smoked a little bit. They also have vape pens in Spain, which is really
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:47.220]  fucking awesome. So you can buy your vape pens and you can get wax, you can get whatever.
[01:52:53.140 --> 01:53:02.020]  And you can smoke, you can do whatever you please. It's pretty awesome. Also, there's a lot
[01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:08.020]  of people that grow there and there are hydro stores around, which is a really good indicator.
[01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:14.100]  There are hydro stores just around, in the neighborhoods. I think I was, where was I?
[01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:23.620]  I was in Blanas, which is some sleepy beach town off the coast. And there's hydro stores wherever
[01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:30.580]  and you can just, yeah, 40 euros a gram for the light-dip gelato. Yeah, it was pretty crazy.
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:40.980]  But yeah, and me and my wife were at this social club, maybe it wasn't, maybe I was with somebody
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:46.820]  else. We were at this social club and we were smoking and we noticed the dominant language
[01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:54.100]  spoken in the social clubs is English. And 50% of the people in the social clubs are Americans.
[01:53:54.980 --> 01:54:02.180]  And 25% of the people in, or half of the Americans in the social clubs are Californians.
[01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:09.300]  It was really, really interesting. Oh man, that one looks nice. The one that I went to
[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:13.780]  was definitely not that nice, but I'm familiar with that one, HQ Barcelona. That's one of the
[01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:21.940]  bougie ones. They got all the same stuff that we have. They smoke Skittles and all kinds of
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:28.900]  stuff like that. It's pretty neat. It's a nice scene. Also, it was really interesting,
[01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:34.980]  the people selling the weed there were Americans. So I don't know what was up with that,
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:44.020]  but the Americans were selling American weed in Spain at multiple locations. And yeah, I mean,
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:49.940]  people apparently are sending light-dip cookies in those weird plastic cookies bags to Spain.
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:55:02.740]  And that's the scene there. So yeah, it's a really interesting place, Spain. And I think a lot of the
[01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:09.460]  cannabis is grown in Spain and sent over to Amsterdam. Chad, I'm curious if that still is
[01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:17.140]  the case, but my understanding, what are you saying? Call me Mark Smith. Yeah, I would love
[01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:24.740]  to check that out. It's a really interesting scene. It's kind of like California. It's almost
[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:32.020]  like a hybrid of like California and Amsterdam. That's kind of how I would describe the Spanish
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:45.220]  scene. It's pretty cool. Yeah, it's pretty cool. So yeah, hopefully we can get Aladdin back on.
[01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:51.220]  We basically just scratched the surface with all of the information that he had.
[01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:56.500]  I know he has a bunch of other lines that he's been working. I know he also has been working
[01:55:56.500 --> 01:56:02.740]  with the Freak Show, which is a really cool one. I was working with the Freak Show a little bit as
[01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:12.020]  well. I kind of veered away from the Freak Show because one, it took a long, long time to finish.
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:20.980]  Two, the Terps were super, super train wreck-y and not in a good way. I just wasn't that impressed.
[01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:27.700]  Usually people do in three, but actually three, which was the buds were super larfy.
[01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:35.860]  Normally, the buds were super larfy and loose. People would be like, yeah, that's a bad thing.
[01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:42.820]  I kind of liked it because one, it kept the buds from rotting. Two, I thought that the Freak Show
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:46.980]  would be a really good candidate for washing just because of the kind of open structure of the
[01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:50.980]  plants. Was Chad saying Freak Show is fun to grow, everyone should do it at least once? Yeah.
[01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:55.220]  Yeah, I mean, it was. Yeah, exactly. It's like everyone do it at least once. I think,
[01:56:55.220 --> 01:56:59.620]  was that last year? It was like last year and the year before were the years when everybody
[01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:04.740]  was growing Freak Show. I don't see really any of those people growing Freak Show again.
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:10.580]  I could be wrong, but in general, I don't.
[01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:23.860]  There's a reason for that. Actually, I've jumped into the Australian Bastard Cannabis,
[01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:32.020]  which has another distorted leaf. I jumped into a Humboldt CSI pack of
[01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:42.420]  cheese by Australian Bastard Cannabis. My goal was to make a hybrid of that that has some sort
[01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:48.180]  of mutated leaf and has a nice cool cheesy flavor to it. Cheese is a great outdoor strain.
[01:57:49.300 --> 01:57:58.020]  It's just a great strain in general. I mean, it's a skunk. I guess I'll tell you guys my theory of
[01:57:58.020 --> 01:58:08.660]  what I'm trying to do is basically, if I grow, I can select for that mutated leaf very early on.
[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:16.180]  So I don't need to grow these plants to any type of size before I can start selecting for what I'm
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:22.820]  looking for, which is that mutated leaf. So basically, as a little cheat, I will... So I
[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:28.580]  already grew my F1s, so I'm going to grow out F2s. So when I grow out my F2s, I can grow out,
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:35.620]  sprout however many seeds. And once the leaf patterns become evident,
[01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:39.220]  I can just start culling the ones that have that regular leaf pattern.
[01:58:43.140 --> 01:58:48.500]  And then selecting for the ones that have that ABC leaf, which is that really weird
[01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:55.380]  kind of... It's not a mutated leaf. How do I describe that leaf? It's almost like...
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:59:00.180]  It's just a weird leaf that does not look like any other cannabis plant that I've seen.
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:06.500]  Is this person saying... I'm thinking about a cross and ABC coming in from... Here's that. Oh,
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:14.900]  cool. Yeah. I mean, I'm really curious, like from the F1s that I grew. So it was a cheese by ABC
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:24.660]  male. And all of the plants had very regular leaves. Oh, cool. How long have you been growing
[01:59:24.660 --> 01:59:40.510]  that, Peter? Oh, how long have you been growing that one for? These are probably maybe a month old.
[01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:47.630]  Okay. So is it less vigorous than a regular plant? That's my suspicion.
[01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:54.750]  Yeah, they're kind of slow growing. I mean, I grew them last summer and or kind of end of maybe into
[01:59:54.750 --> 02:00:04.750]  the fall season. And they got... I mean, so I probably started them in August maybe. And they
[02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:14.190]  got like, I don't know, like four feet tall. But it seemed like later on, they started growing more.
[02:00:14.190 --> 02:00:18.190]  Okay. But yeah, early on, they were definitely like took their time.
[02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:24.750]  Interesting. I have other seeds I popped last week that are already like that big.
[02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:34.830]  But yeah, I want to do a seed run. So that's kind of the purpose of this round.
[02:00:36.110 --> 02:00:40.350]  Very cool. And last year, I grew them like literally right outside our front door with
[02:00:40.670 --> 02:00:45.710]  the whole neighborhood walking by. No one noticed what it was. No one. Everyone was oblivious.
[02:00:45.710 --> 02:00:50.110]  That was one of my inspirations. I saw that show. I was really inspired by that.
[02:00:50.830 --> 02:00:55.790]  Yeah, I just think it's cool to see something where like, you just wait to see if anybody
[02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:59.630]  notices. And then nobody does. How was the smoke?
[02:01:01.870 --> 02:01:07.630]  It was nice. I mean, I've heard other people be kind of critical of it. I mean, it got me high.
[02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:18.990]  And then I have this is a Thai male that I put back in veg.
[02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:25.470]  Nice. I even have it written on there.
[02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:34.110]  So from the Samoan and excuse my pronunciation region.
[02:01:34.990 --> 02:01:44.190]  And then at Chenzo's house, who's in the chat, we have some other that's where the other Thais are.
[02:01:45.790 --> 02:01:52.270]  And they're just I mean, a couple weeks ago, they kind of just started showing sex.
[02:01:52.990 --> 02:01:54.670]  And now they're obviously flowering out.
[02:01:56.110 --> 02:01:57.310]  Oh, they're outside.
[02:01:57.310 --> 02:02:00.510]  Yeah. But I mean, they have a ways to go.
[02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:05.790]  Yeah, I mean, how long do you think they'll like the weather will allow?
[02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:08.430]  Well, we're in LA. So.
[02:02:10.110 --> 02:02:13.390]  So you're good, right? I mean, yeah. Interesting.
[02:02:13.390 --> 02:02:17.790]  It I mean, I don't think there's any frost coming anytime soon.
[02:02:19.230 --> 02:02:23.390]  Do you worry about like the days getting so short and really cold, they stop moving?
[02:02:23.950 --> 02:02:30.350]  A little bit, but I mean, those are a seed preservation run, too.
[02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:34.670]  So I'm not that's kind of the main focus.
[02:02:35.710 --> 02:02:41.950]  But and then I have some seeds from someone else in the chat
[02:02:43.630 --> 02:02:48.030]  who I've starting to do preservation work for as well.
[02:02:48.030 --> 02:02:52.670]  And then I'm just kind of waiting for the weather to get warmer.
[02:02:53.390 --> 02:02:53.950]  I have.
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:01.800]  And then someone was talking about this earlier.
[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:09.940]  Nice. And then here's another tie.
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:16.440]  And then here's a bulk.
[02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:29.970]  So I'm going to start doing just seed preservation projects of all this stuff.
[02:03:30.690 --> 02:03:32.530]  And are you doing like open pollination?
[02:03:33.410 --> 02:03:39.240]  Yeah, I want to get different people to volunteer to help out,
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:41.880]  because obviously I can't do it all myself.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:51.480]  But a whole bunch of kind of like, you know, creating a library where it's not like limited
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:57.320]  supply. And I think it's especially, you know, who is I was I was talking to Kevin
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:02.120]  Jojari about it the other day, but kind of the gist of what I was bringing.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:08.600]  Sun Grown Mids showed something on Instagram or posted something, which was the
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:13.480]  of the bottlenecking, not just the bottlenecking after that.
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:25.240]  Arjan, like basically bringing like the Dutch genetics into, you know,
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:29.240]  parts of the world where there's all this land race stuff and
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:32.360]  it's like let our male pollen spray everywhere.
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:40.120]  And so I kind of and I understand that on the local side, like if you take Thailand as an
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:49.240]  example, the locals don't want to grow the local stuff if their goal is to put food on the table.
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:55.880]  They want to grow the gelato, you know, that whatever they're hearing is, you know, coming
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:02.680]  from the US genetics wise. And so it's almost like saving
[02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:12.840]  wildlife in the rainforest before it's all, you know, before the cattle, the cattle ranchers
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:14.680]  cut it all down. Yeah.
[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:22.920]  So I think all of us collectively, if we can, you know, it's like people going that that's
[02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:28.200]  why I love what he does with Khalifa and a bunch of other guys are doing similar stuff,
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:33.320]  which is just hunting kind of land race stuff and making it available to people.
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:40.360]  And if you can kind of have these libraries of these preservation libraries,
[02:05:42.760 --> 02:05:48.520]  then the low, you know, obviously it's not great if the local ties no longer have any of their
[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:55.880]  land race to heirloom genetics that they were known for. Like at some point, they'll appreciate
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:06:04.760]  that the rest of the world wants the Thai stick, not, you know, Mac grown in Thailand.
[02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:07.960]  Yeah. Sour diesel grown in Thailand.
[02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:09.480]  Right. Yeah.
[02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:18.440]  But but I get, you know, it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:25.480]  it's like in like Lebanon and places like that, like the 25 year olds who are growing,
[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:34.840]  they're starting to grow more of the kind of hybrid stuff. And you understand, like,
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:40.280]  it's logical why they're doing it, because like the other 25 year olds who are smoking
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:44.840]  weed in Morocco and Lebanon and stuff like that, like they want it.
[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:58.140]  But I think, again, as a as a collective, if if we can all chip away at kind of preservation and
[02:06:58.140 --> 02:07:04.940]  for me personally, it's like I love getting. Kind of land race stuff out to people like
[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:10.860]  that conceptually, that's kind of where my head's at in terms of like if someone buys a breed,
[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:17.260]  a pack from a breeder sticking in other stuff and some of it being land race. And it's like
[02:07:17.260 --> 02:07:22.940]  you may never have any interest in this, but it's a tool to add to your tool kit.
[02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:31.740]  For if and when whatever traits that plant has that you think might be valuable,
[02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:39.900]  that you could work it into your projects, if you're breeding your own or if you're a breeder
[02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:47.420]  yourself or for whatever reason. Yeah, no, most definitely. I mean, that's kind of like the
[02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:53.500]  part of the impetus of like, you know, of our eSpace seed collective, right, is, you know,
[02:07:53.500 --> 02:08:00.540]  seed banking, sharing seeds, you know, preserving things, working things in various directions.
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:05.420]  Yeah, most definitely. And I mean, like what you're saying, kind of like
[02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:12.380]  I think cannabis is legalized in Thailand. So it's, you know, it's about getting those things
[02:08:12.380 --> 02:08:16.300]  from Thailand quickly because, of course, you know, people are going to be growing whatever
[02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:21.820]  they think is going to sell the best. It's like if you think of kind of a lot of the
[02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:29.260]  kind of iconic sampling of like 80s or like 90s hip hop, where it was like some
[02:08:29.980 --> 02:08:42.060]  obscure 60s or 70s vinyl where someone stumbled on it and pulled a sample of it. And but like,
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:48.300]  you know, going into record stores, it's like maybe there's one copy left of something or,
[02:08:48.860 --> 02:09:01.820]  you know, someone just sent me old, old jazz and rock music from the Central Asian area from the
[02:09:01.820 --> 02:09:09.580]  70s that I want to start listening to. And I bet you can't. I mean, maybe like in a crate somewhere
[02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:16.380]  in Uzbekistan or somewhere in Russia, maybe you'd like be flipping through vinyl and come across
[02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:27.980]  like this 70 like my brother and his wife's from Iran. And when they got married, I was the DJ.
[02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:39.740]  And before their wedding, I just started doing a deep dive into like 70s Indian and Iranian
[02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:46.940]  funk and rock and psychedelic music. And the shit I mean, the music was amazing where I just
[02:09:46.940 --> 02:09:54.060]  hear these like, you know, like bass lines or drums or whatever, just had like, you know,
[02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:58.940]  you're like heads bopping. And I was like, I want to start sampling all this stuff.
[02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:09.420]  Go ahead. No, please. Please. I'm just babbling. But conceptually, it's like
[02:10:10.220 --> 02:10:14.860]  before all that stuff gets lost, I think we're all on the same page. It's like,
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:22.140]  let's at least preserve it and make it accessible so that even when someone in the East Bay
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:27.180]  needs something, they're taken care of. Or if someone, you know, wherever
[02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:32.940]  wants to. And I also like the idea of people wanting to explore stuff. It's like, look,
[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:38.940]  it may not look great. It may not yield. It may not have the THC numbers that the
[02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:44.620]  rec market want, but I just want to play with it. It's like someone listening to,
[02:10:46.940 --> 02:10:53.500]  you know. Old records versus current top 40 music.
[02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:59.260]  I mean, I completely agree. Are you familiar with the Ethiopics?
[02:11:00.220 --> 02:11:05.260]  Hmm. Yeah. I mean, like when you're talking about that, that's what I thought of is
[02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:11.420]  Ethiopics, which is like, wait. Yeah. Ethiopics, which is not the band, but the whole it's like
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:17.820]  a type of is it considered a type of music where it's like the Ethiopian jazz of the 70s?
[02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:21.340]  And there was like a bunch of these records that were put out.
[02:11:21.820 --> 02:11:32.620]  It's. I think, yeah, it was kind of like the. Like, you know, like the.
[02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:43.660]  I'm trying to think of compilations that are. Yeah, it was compilations, right, of Ethiopian
[02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:48.220]  music in the same way that like, I don't know, Ministry of Sound did like
[02:11:49.420 --> 02:11:59.020]  house and techno compilations in the 90s and 2000s. But I love digging through shit like that
[02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:05.180]  and just just sitting there and listening to song after song and seeing how something hits me.
[02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:14.700]  Yeah. Like the Afro. I mean, I've gone through like just fun personal. That's actually one of
[02:12:14.700 --> 02:12:20.860]  the things I'd love to do is create like a shared like online drive where everyone can
[02:12:21.420 --> 02:12:26.940]  pull music and just listen. Right. Like while you're working, while you're doing whatever,
[02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:35.340]  just have like that mixed playlist of of like Bob Amal and like, yeah, like
[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:43.420]  go do deep dives into different regions. Right. Yeah. That'd be super interesting. Like a killer
[02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:53.260]  from different decades. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, anyway, that was my ramble on
[02:12:53.420 --> 02:13:01.260]  on land racy stuff and then also just kind of starting in on a bunch of projects.
[02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:06.460]  Nice. To basically just make more seeds like this, you know.
[02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:15.740]  I mean, that's well, this has more than some of the other stuff. But like, yeah, like this.
[02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:33.320]  I only have that many seeds. So, you know, making more from that because the. Yeah. The fear is that,
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:38.680]  you know, sometimes the people who currently have that library may lose it for whatever reason.
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:43.880]  Yeah, no, I mean, I would say definitely East Bay Seed Collective,
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:50.280]  East Bay Seed Collective, which were also those members were ever in Colorado. But we would
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:55.640]  totally be down to, you know, collaborate, I'm assuming with the other members and, you know,
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:00.680]  with you and, you know, those types of things, because that's totally what we're,
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:08.680]  what we've been doing. Yeah. I mean, there are. Let me get this echo. There are some breeders
[02:14:08.680 --> 02:14:13.880]  who have some really cool stuff out there. Yeah. I mean, I think it's cool to to back them up.
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:17.800]  Right. And that's kind of what we're doing is making sure that there's like backups of these
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:30.200]  things. Yeah, it's like like, aren't there vegetable seed banks in like Norway or like,
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:37.960]  you know what I'm talking about? Yeah. Frozen ones. Actually, my local library has a seed bank,
[02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:42.200]  a vegetable seed bank in the front of the library, which is like one of their new,
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:46.760]  their brand new things, which I thought was really cool. It tickled my heart just to like,
[02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:53.880]  see these little like, like little drawers, like little mini drawers and like,
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:56.200]  Yeah, like the Dewey Decimal System drawers.
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:00.200]  Exactly. And it's just like, you know, only take what you need. And, you know,
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:04.920]  it's not very developed, but it was. So if that happens, right?
[02:15:05.640 --> 02:15:10.040]  Yeah, I was just like, shit, that's a really good idea. It's just simple and like,
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:16.120]  straightforward. And I mean, for us, the hardest part is getting started because it's like,
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:20.680]  we want to do seed expansions. And it's like, well, what do we consider the right expansion?
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:24.840]  You know what I mean? And are we selecting or are we just doing open pollination?
[02:15:26.040 --> 02:15:31.400]  You know what I mean? And it's like, for us, that's kind of like the minutia of it is kind
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:36.840]  of what's been getting us stuck. But I mean, I don't know, I think it's just about getting,
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:41.160]  just moving forward and doing it. Yeah.
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:48.840]  Yeah. Like on the psilocybin front, I know a guy down here in SoCal, who's in his 70s,
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:16:02.120]  who has like a spore library of 140 ish kind of different, I guess you call them strains in this
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:09.720]  case, that he's collected from around the world for 40 years. And, you know, that was something
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:14.360]  that previously I hadn't thought of that there, you know, within the psilocybin world, it's like
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:20.760]  cannabis, right? Like different strains will have different effects. And, you know, obviously it's
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:29.320]  fun, but, you know, there's also medicinal value and it's like exploring each one, one by one to
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:34.920]  be like, okay, like what are the nuanced differences between these and then how do we preserve them?
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:38.760]  Because this guy spent eight years in federal prison.
[02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:52.280]  And he, he's, yeah, he, if he got caught with certain stuff, he would go back to
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:17:01.960]  prison. And he's also getting old. So like, if, you know, if he dies or whatever,
[02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:04.440]  you know, does all that stuff get lost?
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:10.440]  Interesting. Does he have it backed up?
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:19.880]  He has it. I haven't talked to him since kind of just right before COVID. So I need to
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:25.960]  get back in touch. I've just been so busy with other stuff, but get back in touch with it.
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:31.240]  Because what I had always wanted to do was to grow each one out one by one. And then basically,
[02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:36.200]  like almost have parties where everybody, if you want to microdose, if you want to macrodose, but
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:48.600]  like give us feedback on how this specific one that's regionally from Thailand made you feel,
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:54.600]  like if it's a medical purpose or just a recreational purpose, you know, what,
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:18:00.040]  what was the experience like for you microdosing, for you macrodosing,
[02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:08.680]  and then grow out the next one and kind of one by one, get them out there in front of a
[02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:14.040]  sample size of people to explore each one.
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:22.680]  That's awesome. You know, my latest thing I've been into is starting to collect cactus.
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:24.760]  I want to do that too. Yeah.
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:32.200]  And what I've found is that it's so much easier to keep your samples.
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:39.880]  And it's amazing because they're cacti. You know, like they don't have to be watered all the time.
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:47.400]  They're just kind of chilling in California. And yeah, I mean, you know, they all have different
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:55.080]  effects and it's just, for me, it's nice because like, you know, as compared to like a cannabis
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:19:03.240]  clone, it's so much easier to keep alive and there's no plant limits and, you know, you can
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:10.600]  just have a million cacti in your yard. So. As all the neighbors walk by.
[02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:14.840]  Yeah. And then they kind of go like, all right, you have a bunch of interesting cacti, but,
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:19.560]  you know, like they're cool. I mean, and I guess we're enthenogenic collectors.
[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:26.680]  Yeah. Now that's good because my wife always freaks out with the, A, she hates the smell of
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:34.760]  weed. And then her super conservative parents live one mile from us. And they're like, her dad was
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:48.430]  here playing with the baby this morning. And Alex, I see that. We'll have to do a cactus show
[02:19:48.430 --> 02:19:53.390]  and tell. Alex can, I'm going to connect you guys. He couldn't come on today, but I'll connect you
[02:19:53.390 --> 02:20:05.790]  guys. I would love to do a cactus show and tell. Yeah, we can go down. I like that rabbit hole.
[02:20:07.790 --> 02:20:13.390]  Awesome. Yeah. I wasn't sure about like, you know, other, other types of things on the show.
[02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:20.510]  I could care. As long as you find something interesting in your, I think that's the only
[02:20:20.510 --> 02:20:26.750]  criteria is like, is it a topic you're passionate about and go for it?
[02:20:27.870 --> 02:20:30.590]  Okay. Or like interested in learning about, right?
[02:20:31.150 --> 02:20:35.550]  Yeah. I mean, it's my, it's, it's a new thing, but like, I guess instead of buying
[02:20:36.110 --> 02:20:44.750]  cannabis seeds, I now buy cactus plants. Yeah. So we're, we're going to, down here in SoCal,
[02:20:44.750 --> 02:20:56.510]  start in on some heavy production of all kinds of mushrooms. Cool. Like everything from lion's mane
[02:20:56.510 --> 02:21:05.850]  to reishi to more funky stuff. Nice. I really like pink chanterelles are delicious.
[02:21:08.250 --> 02:21:13.850]  Yeah. And this guy, I actually have a video I did with this guy that it would take me a while
[02:21:13.850 --> 02:21:19.530]  to dig it up, but he schooled me on like the different substrates that different
[02:21:20.250 --> 02:21:27.130]  types of mushrooms like, and, you know, getting to know a mushroom and like the mix of substrate,
[02:21:28.330 --> 02:21:35.290]  which was really cool. And then like he had built his own tissue, you know, homemade tissue culture
[02:21:35.290 --> 02:21:42.890]  lab. Hold on. My wife's I know that's my four-year-old with my wife's phone. Ah, Alex. Very
[02:21:43.850 --> 02:21:53.130]  nice. Here. Let me see if I can show his cacti more than one cactus.
[02:21:55.850 --> 02:21:58.170]  That's all right. I gotta give me a second.
[02:22:01.050 --> 02:22:09.610]  But yeah, so, so this guy had, you know, he, he built out like a home tissue culture lab and was
[02:22:09.610 --> 02:22:18.410]  like teaching me how to do tissue culture and just a super awesome, smart 70 something year old
[02:22:18.410 --> 02:22:27.050]  guy who unfortunately spent eight years. So he spent eight years in federal prison for making,
[02:22:31.370 --> 02:22:35.130]  basically doing extraction for people with cancer at Cedar Sinai.
[02:22:35.210 --> 02:22:39.450]  Here, down here in LA, like he had cancer and he was making,
[02:22:43.050 --> 02:22:52.570]  you know, essentially concentrate for people in the cancer ward and the, and, and during his,
[02:22:52.570 --> 02:23:00.570]  he got tried once and then the federal government came in and tried him. And even though all the
[02:23:01.530 --> 02:23:06.170]  doctors and nurses and patients like vouch for him, like he wasn't selling it.
[02:23:08.970 --> 02:23:10.970]  Just for manufacture, not for sales.
[02:23:12.650 --> 02:23:18.330]  He was giving it away to the other cancer patients and he himself had cancer and all the doctors and
[02:23:19.050 --> 02:23:24.810]  like everybody in Cedar Sinai testified on his behalf and the federal government was like,
[02:23:24.810 --> 02:23:28.250]  we don't give a shit. You're going down. What year was this?
[02:23:31.050 --> 02:23:40.570]  He was still on, he was in the last year of probation. It was probably, I want to say like
[02:23:42.970 --> 02:23:48.890]  two, I don't remember the, but like after 2000 and before 2010 maybe.
[02:23:49.530 --> 02:23:49.850]  Wow.
[02:23:53.130 --> 02:23:55.130]  Here, hold on. Sorry. I can't remember if I-
[02:23:55.130 --> 02:23:57.290]  So that wasn't protected under 215?
[02:23:58.090 --> 02:24:18.170]  Evidently not. All right, let's find, and then I got to turn these from hike to where are you?
[02:24:19.850 --> 02:24:31.300]  Man, you should see people in the cacti community take their fertilizing
[02:24:31.940 --> 02:24:33.380]  just as serious as we do.
[02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:40.180]  Well that, so in terms of the media, right, it's very different.
[02:24:40.420 --> 02:24:42.420]  Soil? I mean, people use soil?
[02:24:43.940 --> 02:24:47.540]  Just like straight soil or more like sandy and-
[02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:52.180]  I mean, they use ocean forest with perlite.
[02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:54.820]  Oh, so just straight up-
[02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:56.900]  Some, yeah, I mean-
[02:24:56.900 --> 02:24:58.260]  Row, okay.
[02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:04.260]  Yeah, and like people use like insect frass and cow mag and silica and kelp, like,
[02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:06.980]  I mean, it's the same stuff.
[02:25:10.980 --> 02:25:15.540]  Sorry, I'm trying to look through these tiny thumbnail images.
[02:25:16.740 --> 02:25:21.060]  Yeah, I have some dragon fruit growing outside right now.
[02:25:22.180 --> 02:25:24.020]  Where the hell are the cacti?
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:32.440]  Yeah, Alex said he's used the same living soil he grows weed in.
[02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:32.680]  Okay.
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:35.720]  So that's easy.
[02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:38.440]  Oh, here they are.
[02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:39.880]  Oh, sweet, they're already jpegs.
[02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:40.200]  Okay.
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:44.840]  I mean, this person's asking thoughts on vermiculite versus perlite.
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:46.440]  So I feel like, do you know about this?
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:51.960]  Like vermiculite back in the day had some like asbestos in it or like some-
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:54.360]  I think it was asbestos in it, which gave it a bad name.
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:58.760]  And so now vermiculite always says asbestos free on it
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:01.720]  because it no longer has asbestos in it.
[02:26:01.720 --> 02:26:04.520]  And I think that's why back in the day it had a bad name.
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:08.120]  I think it's a pretty popular thing that people grow with mushrooms is vermiculite.
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:12.720]  Sorry, let me just-
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:19.320]  Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:26.210]  Vermiculite is more water-retention.
[02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:34.450]  Perlite I don't like, just because I feel like it's not very environmentally-
[02:26:34.450 --> 02:26:39.450]  It's not very environmentally.
[02:26:39.450 --> 02:26:46.110]  Add image.
[02:26:46.110 --> 02:26:59.380]  Hey, Alex, we'd love to have you on.
[02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:03.380]  Yeah, I'll send the email.
[02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:06.380]  So there's one.
[02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:19.270]  It's also interesting like cactus hybrids, like when you can compare like cactus to cannabis.
[02:27:19.270 --> 02:27:30.270]  There are some differences. There are also like some similarities as far as like the way that hybrids look comparative like pure breeds and various kinds.
[02:27:30.270 --> 02:27:45.270]  Just like the whole movement for land race varieties and people saving the originals and then also people really liking their high, you know, different hybrid varieties that are like you know multi poly hybrid.
[02:27:45.270 --> 02:27:58.270]  And it's cool because like you can have both. It's like seems a little less fractured compared to the cannabis community. Maybe it's just because I'm new to cactus, but it seems a little more open.
[02:27:58.270 --> 02:28:19.270]  Maybe because. Yeah, it's but it's cool. Like, you really get a chance to kind of appreciate the structure and the effect and vigor of these different specimens similar to cannabis, but you can collect in some cases larger amounts or, you know, different types of populations of these plants.
[02:28:19.270 --> 02:28:20.270]  Yeah.
[02:28:20.270 --> 02:28:48.270]  Yeah. And then here someone mentioned pumice. So I use pumice personally and and clay pellets rather than perlite and like perlite is what you find in every kind of store bought soil because it's the light, you know, they're shipping pellets all over the country.
[02:28:48.270 --> 02:29:00.270]  So perlite is the easy cheap. I mean, could you imagine pumice and every pallet palleted bags and pallets of soil shipped all over the country?
[02:29:00.270 --> 02:29:29.270]  Well, like so when I worked at a hydro store, we would ship in perlite and so my boss would get it in a U-Haul truck. And you know, the volume is crazy large, right? So like a U-Haul truck might have like 30 bags of perlite in it. Like not a lot. And, you know, like you have to be very careful when you take it out because if you rub any of the bags, if the bags break, you literally have perlite just like spilling out everywhere.
[02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:58.270]  And it's super dusty and yeah, it's gross. It's like a huge, was always a huge hassle. But I mean, imagine like the pumice stone bags were always like tiny and super heavy. But yeah, I use pumice too. And I mean, pumice is cool because it's like lasts forever. So I have a bag that I bought, I don't know, five years ago and the pumice is still just like kicking around. I'll put it in different things and it's still there.
[02:30:03.780 --> 02:30:06.780]  Well, shoot, I was thinking of maybe wrapping her up for today.
[02:30:06.780 --> 02:30:21.780]  Yeah, I'm thinking half the people in the chat are still waiting for their Kevin Jodry seeds and Mean Gene seeds from the fundraiser. And they're like, I got to go right over there and keep packing.
[02:30:21.780 --> 02:30:38.780]  Awesome. Well, yeah. Thank you, Peter, for the assistance. And thank you, everybody in the chat. And thanks, Khalifa, for coming on. I appreciate that. It was a really interesting conversation. We definitely have to have you come on for part two.
[02:30:38.780 --> 02:30:43.780]  Johnny, yours is being packed up in about 10 minutes.
[02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:49.780]  And yeah, everybody has a great day.
[02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:54.780]  All right. Yeah. And I'll connect you with Alex in the background.
[02:30:54.780 --> 02:30:57.780]  Awesome. Thank you. And I should probably end broadcast, right?
[02:30:57.780 --> 02:30:58.780]  Yes.
[02:30:58.780 --> 02:31:00.780]  Awesome. Thanks, guys. Have a good day.
