[00:00.760 --> 00:06.500]  the one that's the one that's
[00:06.500 --> 00:11.440]  the right the moment everybody's been waiting for we are not I take it away
[00:11.440 --> 00:16.780]  Brian yeah what's up living soil nerds happy Wednesday to you- it's our second show Marco
[00:16.780 --> 00:21.920]  and I come into live from Colorado and Virginia. Shout out always to Mr Westport
[00:21.920 --> 00:30.120]  doing his thing behind the scenes. Helping us be able to. I will try to fix that.
[00:30.120 --> 00:57.120]  The issue that was the reason why you know we're a couple minutes late. Hopefully we can get that to work out. But our guest I feel like his is tenacity is that some of the best ways to describe this gentleman from what I understand. He's had his Instagram deleted multiple times at the height of his kind of hiatus on Instagram. It was over 30,000 followers. I don't know for you guys out there but if you ever build up an Instagram that's a lot of hard work.
[00:57.120 --> 01:14.120]  But he continues to put out there and put out some of the- you know some of the genetics that I feel like this industry is really understanding is tried and true- and- I feel like something so that I was wanting to say before this was going on is. You're known for the- the boom fire. I hope I said that correctly.
[01:14.120 --> 01:43.120]  So I did want to kind of start that show and on a fun note man and just kind of again- you seem like you're always about educating. Love and respect is what you seem to give and give off. On social media platforms and I kind of think so. Right before you fell off there so I was just kind of again kind of going through what you've done some of the stuff that really sticks out I feel like- industry wise. Are some of the genetics that you've had I was talking about how your Instagram is a little bit different.
[01:43.120 --> 02:07.120]  I was talking about how your Instagram tenacity was one of the words I used to just describe you because it's a hell of a hell of a mountain to climb that bitch every time Instagram delete you. But some of the genetics even before we came on this show Marco and I were talking about some of the stuff that's really sticking out is you're running with like the white truffle, Hawaiian punch, dip and sticks, the chimera. I hope I'm saying that correctly.
[02:07.120 --> 02:08.120]  Chimera yeah Rasta.
[02:08.120 --> 02:12.120]  Chimera alright. The truff-a-ola?
[02:12.120 --> 02:14.120]  Truffaloha yeah.
[02:14.120 --> 02:15.120]  Truffaloha.
[02:15.120 --> 02:18.120]  Truffle and Aloha together because it's the Hawaiian punch.
[02:18.120 --> 02:21.120]  And by the way how that one starred. That one looks fantastic.
[02:21.120 --> 02:22.120]  So sexy.
[02:22.120 --> 02:28.120]  And then another one that really stood out it seems like industry wise was something that was called the creature.
[02:28.120 --> 02:29.120]  Yes.
[02:29.120 --> 02:48.120]  So I wanted to kind of also get in and you know kind of build your background. More people kind of understand where you're from so I was going to let you kind of do that but I wanted to also give a shout out to you know we were talking about sometimes there's somebody that needs to say certain things about you or if you're able to collab with certain people and it seems like you're always moving with the right crowd.
[02:49.120 --> 03:12.120]  I know that you just posted up a collab with in-house genetics for the lava girl. So I just wanted to plug that as well man. I think you're out there doing big big things for yourself and continuing to work with you know from what I know of the industry the right people to get the genetics that you want to really pheno hunt and then you know potentially build a brand or build a name around the genetics that you're hunting.
[03:13.120 --> 03:26.120]  So without further ado man I'd love for you to just kind of give your background. You are public but at the same time you do seem kind of private man when I was doing research for this interview. You're still kind of a private dude. So we're excited to be able to pick your brain today.
[03:26.120 --> 03:31.120]  Yeah. I appreciate it. Yeah. It's all love and respect. So yeah.
[03:31.120 --> 03:47.120]  You mentioned some of the strains that we've that we've worked with and so forth. And yeah I'm very proud of the work that we've done. We I've been in the industry for been growing for about 32 years.
[03:48.120 --> 04:05.120]  So I got quite a bit of experience and I just kind of grew you know black market off the radar or whatever for for a very long time and just recently obviously in the last five or 10 years began getting licenses and so forth.
[04:06.120 --> 04:19.120]  So a lot of you know black market getting rated and you know getting the stripes and kind of working in the industry and taking the chances that that you know built the foundation that I stand on now.
[04:20.120 --> 04:29.120]  So it's been it's been a great journey a lot of fun and we found a lot of really cool stuff along the way. So yeah.
[04:30.120 --> 04:38.120]  Started breeding now but basically to take you back a little further. You know I started growing when I was 12 years old.
[04:39.120 --> 04:54.120]  So I had found I had found my mom's bag of Mexican brick weed in the pantry and I kind of wondered what it was all about. And I knew that you know you basically you smoke this or whatever.
[04:55.120 --> 05:08.120]  And so I took a little bit and went and went and smoked some with some couple of buddies of mine. That was you know seventh grade and I just fell in love with the plant.
[05:09.120 --> 05:26.120]  And obviously being a brick weed I I found seeds and I was just amazed because actually before that point I had I had grown a bunch of things like flowers and vegetables and lettuces and fruits and stuff.
[05:27.120 --> 05:36.120]  I started growing when I was very young about 10 or 11 years old. And when I when I broke up the ganja and found the seeds I was just absolutely blown away.
[05:37.120 --> 05:51.120]  I was like wait wait hold on you can actually you can you plant this and grow this. Like what's that about. So like that was a huge epiphany. And ever since then I've just been absolutely in love with cultivating cannabis.
[05:52.120 --> 06:18.120]  So yeah just absolutely in love with it. So I grew you know in closets and spare bedrooms for several decades and just kind of honed the craft you know through experimentation and failure which is the best teacher you can have is failing firsthand and seeing seeing the results of your action or lack of action with the plants.
[06:19.120 --> 06:30.120]  So it was it was about eight years ago when I decided to become very serious with cultivating and move into a larger commercial arena with licensed facilities and so forth.
[06:32.120 --> 06:47.120]  Up until that point I was a real estate agent in Las Vegas and growing on the side. So we were selling a bunch of houses and doing really well in the market out there and decided to kind of invest a little bit and get into the the business.
[06:48.120 --> 06:56.120]  And I started cultivating a little more seriously and a little more full time. So I left the real estate behind and started cultivating completely full time.
[06:57.120 --> 07:11.120]  And you know just room after room and just building up the best cultivation spots and rooms and facilities I could and then acquiring the best genetics possible.
[07:12.120 --> 07:23.120]  So it's about that time that I basically made a plan to to be associated a little closer with some of my friends in the industry and more publicly and more commercially.
[07:24.120 --> 07:42.120]  So I started I made a list of about 25 breeders I wanted to work with and I went at went at them pretty hard or you know in some cases very easy if they were willing to to give up the goods and let me test for them.
[07:42.120 --> 07:54.120]  But I basically offered my facilities and my grow expertise to to test for them and it worked out pretty good.
[07:54.120 --> 08:06.120]  I got most of the breeders kind of on the team and got testers and so forth sent to me so I can run through them and and see what was going on with their genetics.
[08:07.120 --> 08:13.120]  Basically I can describe like I did a pheno hunt of all the top breeders that I saw as the top breeders at that point.
[08:14.120 --> 08:22.120]  And I really wanted to see who had the best of the best. So I didn't you know have at that point a ton of cash.
[08:23.120 --> 08:29.120]  And I figured that offering my facility in my areas my rooms to test would be kind of the best way to get in there.
[08:30.120 --> 08:45.120]  So that's what I did. And I was very fortunate and I'm very grateful that many of the best breeders responded and gave me an opportunity to work with their phenomenal genetics.
[08:46.120 --> 08:56.120]  So you know Gage Green and Inhouse were of course two of the first that I started working with and testing for.
[08:57.120 --> 09:04.120]  And many many many breeders have been added to that repertoire since.
[09:05.120 --> 09:11.120]  So it was awesome because it gave me a great opportunity to see firsthand you know what different breeders brought to the table.
[09:12.120 --> 09:17.120]  And I grew regs and fems and whatever was sent to me.
[09:18.120 --> 09:24.120]  And after that other people started to send me seeds and basically I've never turned down seeds.
[09:25.120 --> 09:33.120]  Anybody wants to send me seeds I take them. I've grown them out. I've got a ton of seeds now and not enough space to grow them all at this time.
[09:34.120 --> 09:43.120]  So I've got a little bit of a backlog but the top 25 breeders that I put on the list really came through for the most part.
[09:44.120 --> 09:48.120]  A couple didn't respond. They're probably very busy and didn't see the messages or whatnot.
[09:49.120 --> 09:55.120]  But the 20 or more that we worked with right away were just amazing.
[09:56.120 --> 09:58.120]  And we started doing pheno hunts.
[09:58.120 --> 10:06.120]  My first pheno hunt was you know I think a couple of packs of seeds and did really well with it from Gage Green.
[10:07.120 --> 10:20.120]  And just started you know lighting up the passion to grow more and more and more seeds and just do larger pheno hunts and just bigger and bigger and bigger every single time.
[10:21.120 --> 10:30.120]  So I mean it was two packs to 10 packs to 50 packs to 100 packs and just kept getting bigger and bigger.
[10:31.120 --> 10:42.120]  So basically I reworked the traditional pheno hunt in the way that we can do it in a smaller space to hunt as many plants as possible.
[10:42.120 --> 10:55.120]  What I decided basically is that instead of growing plants that we don't really know yet from seed and growing them as we normally would in a commercial facility,
[10:56.120 --> 11:06.120]  three, four, five, six foot tall and the same width, instead of investing all the money and the time and the energy on a very large plant and hoping that it works out,
[11:06.120 --> 11:12.120]  we decided to start pheno hunting plants in a very small format.
[11:13.120 --> 11:24.120]  So basically instead of having this huge plant and only being able to fit you know maybe four plants or six or even nine plants a light like you would in a commercial environment in most cases,
[11:25.120 --> 11:36.120]  I decided to put you know 100 plants per light and do six inch by six inch spacing so you can just cram a ton of plants in a small area.
[11:37.120 --> 11:40.120]  So the idea you know with the pheno hunt is that you're trying to find the best of the best.
[11:41.120 --> 11:46.120]  So the more subjects or more potential plants you have in there, the better off you're going to do.
[11:46.120 --> 11:53.120]  So if you're pheno hunting for the best genetics, then you want to plant as many seeds as you possibly can.
[11:54.120 --> 12:08.120]  So that's what we did. We decided that we want to go tighter and tighter and tighter and I worked with it till it got to the point where in our raised beds, which is where we do our pheno hunts for the most part,
[12:09.120 --> 12:22.120]  you know we're able to put up to 120 plants in a 48 by 48 or under one light, 48 inch by 48 inch square or segment of the raised bed.
[12:23.120 --> 12:31.120]  So we were able to tuck a lot of plants in a smaller place and started doing pheno hunts of hundreds and thousands.
[12:31.120 --> 12:39.120]  And you know our last largest pheno hunt was 6,500 seeds planted.
[12:40.120 --> 12:46.120]  We do smaller pheno hunts here and there as well, especially from testing my own genetics and so forth that I've bred.
[12:47.120 --> 12:51.120]  But predominantly we like to do thousands and thousands of seeds at a time.
[12:52.120 --> 12:58.120]  And we just kept getting closer and closer and now I'm at four inch spacing on my pheno hunts.
[12:58.120 --> 13:12.120]  So we have a raised bed. I put a mix of cocoa and peat moss 50-50 and I do organic and veganic bottled nutrients.
[13:13.120 --> 13:16.120]  So I'm kind of getting the best of both worlds in my opinion.
[13:17.120 --> 13:23.120]  I do want to have the cultivation be an expression of who I am and I am vegan and I do eat organic.
[13:23.120 --> 13:34.120]  So having those play into the expression of my cultivation brings a certain congruence to my life and my flowers and products.
[13:35.120 --> 13:40.120]  So we like to have something teeming with microbes and life.
[13:41.120 --> 13:47.120]  At the same time I want the convenience that I would really need in a cultivation facility that's commercial.
[13:48.120 --> 13:52.120]  So we decided to do the bottled organic and veganic nutrients.
[13:53.120 --> 13:55.120]  Which works out really well for me.
[13:56.120 --> 14:00.120]  There are a few things I add in and tickle the girls with every once in a while.
[14:01.120 --> 14:09.120]  But predominantly we're talking about a couple lines worth of products that are mixed together and that I use as the base.
[14:10.120 --> 14:15.120]  So basically we started doing thousands of seeds at a time.
[14:16.120 --> 14:17.120]  The winners were better.
[14:17.120 --> 14:22.120]  When you have 10 plants to choose from you get a little desperate in some cases.
[14:23.120 --> 14:26.120]  Some packs are crazy and you get winner after winner.
[14:27.120 --> 14:31.120]  But we just wanted to be more picky.
[14:32.120 --> 14:33.120]  We wanted winners that were of higher quality.
[14:34.120 --> 14:37.120]  We wanted winners that checked all the boxes or as many of those boxes as possible.
[14:38.120 --> 14:45.120]  So we developed a 27 point grading system that I use.
[14:45.120 --> 14:50.120]  There are 27 different characteristics of the plants that I'm looking for.
[14:51.120 --> 15:08.120]  Things like harvest weight, trichome coverage, terpenes, how loud is it, how does she root, how does she clone, is she aggressive in veg, does she play well with others.
[15:09.120 --> 15:10.120]  These are the attributes that we're considering.
[15:11.120 --> 15:12.120]  There are 27 of them.
[15:12.120 --> 15:21.120]  So basically what we do is I take every one of those attributes and rate the plant in my opinion from 0 to 100.
[15:22.120 --> 15:25.120]  So 100 being the best and 0 being the worst.
[15:26.120 --> 15:31.120]  A plant has a potential to get a score of 2,700 at the best.
[15:32.120 --> 15:33.120]  That's the best score.
[15:34.120 --> 15:36.120]  We haven't found any plants that have met that yet.
[15:37.120 --> 15:38.120]  We're still hunting.
[15:39.120 --> 15:40.120]  We're still looking for that.
[15:40.120 --> 15:45.120]  We rate the plants and we pay attention.
[15:46.120 --> 15:48.120]  We watch them, we smell them, we look at them.
[15:49.120 --> 15:50.120]  We take notes.
[15:51.120 --> 15:52.120]  We're in there every single day.
[15:53.120 --> 15:55.120]  Hand feeding these rooms for the most part.
[15:56.120 --> 16:01.120]  And just all over paying attention to every attribute that it has.
[16:02.120 --> 16:04.120]  I treat them like I do in a commercial environment.
[16:05.120 --> 16:06.120]  So I don't go super easy on newts.
[16:07.120 --> 16:08.120]  I go with our nutrient schedule that we use.
[16:08.120 --> 16:13.120]  Because I'm trying to find plants that are going to work well with that schedule.
[16:14.120 --> 16:24.120]  Really in a commercial environment you don't want to have a bunch of plants that are requiring too much individual specifications in their nutrients or pH or whatnot.
[16:25.120 --> 16:34.120]  So one of the aims is to find plants that fit the script and fit into the mold that we have for our commercial environments.
[16:35.120 --> 16:41.120]  And we think that that is pretty on par with what most commercial environments want.
[16:42.120 --> 16:54.120]  So when we're selecting those for our attributes, personally for our environments, I think it carries over well to other people's cultivations in commercial use.
[16:55.120 --> 17:04.120]  So basically when you have thousands and thousands of seeds, you have much greater opportunity to find the fire.
[17:05.120 --> 17:09.120]  So that's the whole idea is planting as many seeds as we possibly can.
[17:10.120 --> 17:12.120]  You don't need a large plant.
[17:13.120 --> 17:14.120]  You don't need to invest.
[17:15.120 --> 17:20.120]  You should not be investing a large amount of money in an unknown plant in a cultivation area.
[17:20.120 --> 17:28.120]  Because you're going to lose money versus cultivating for a plant that you already know well that's going to produce.
[17:29.120 --> 17:31.120]  This is strictly speaking in a commercial environment.
[17:32.120 --> 17:37.120]  If it's not commercial, obviously different factors would be involved.
[17:38.120 --> 17:49.120]  A lot of our clients, especially with the Oklahoma clone market, which is absolutely on fire out here for us, demand obviously commercial viable strains.
[17:50.120 --> 17:56.120]  Strains that can produce enough weight to make it justifiable to fit their books.
[17:57.120 --> 18:05.120]  And something that pleases the crowd and actually has medicinal effects and is a strong potent cultivar.
[18:06.120 --> 18:13.120]  So basically, we forged a lot of great relationships with most of the great breeders in the industry.
[18:14.120 --> 18:16.120]  And I have a lot of good friends that are breeders.
[18:16.120 --> 18:31.120]  And we're just really excited to come to the point where I work with over 48 breeders and then countless other people that are hobbyists who throw me packs of seeds here and there.
[18:32.120 --> 18:33.120]  I absolutely grow those out.
[18:34.120 --> 18:41.120]  And I don't care if you're the biggest breeder in the world or some guy who it's his first time and he happened to find some seeds.
[18:41.120 --> 18:48.120]  I'll grow those seeds because there is fire to be found in unexpected places.
[18:49.120 --> 18:52.120]  I found that you don't have to have the best seed pack to find the best one.
[18:53.120 --> 19:02.120]  It helps. And the better the reputation of the breeder in most cases, you're going to find the better quality results in those seed packs.
[19:03.120 --> 19:05.120]  But it's not always the case. Most of the time it is.
[19:05.120 --> 19:14.120]  So basically, when we're looking through thousands of seeds, 6,000 seeds, you're going to find a better quality product.
[19:15.120 --> 19:22.120]  If you plant 10 seeds of one strain and hunt it, you're probably going to find a winner. Maybe not. Maybe you find a couple.
[19:23.120 --> 19:27.120]  If you plant 100 of those seeds, you're going to find a much quality winner by the odds.
[19:28.120 --> 19:33.120]  Obviously, there's an exception to every rule. But by the odds, you're going to find a better winner.
[19:33.120 --> 19:41.120]  And if you plant 1,000 of those seeds or 5,000 of the same strain, most likely you're going to find the best pheno that's available in there.
[19:42.120 --> 19:48.120]  And that's what we're looking for. We're looking for the best phenos that are available within certain crosses.
[19:49.120 --> 19:56.120]  And hype stuff is cool, but I don't necessarily lean towards that. I just grow it all out and let the plants talk.
[19:57.120 --> 20:04.120]  Yeah, man, I want to kind of get deeper into that. If you could, B-Leaf, is there any way that you could put the camera on a solid surface?
[20:05.120 --> 20:06.120]  Yeah, I can.
[20:07.120 --> 20:14.120]  Yeah. I know it's close to Halloween. I guess it feels a little like a Blair Witch to some of the audience.
[20:15.120 --> 20:19.120]  And then if you could just turn.
[20:20.120 --> 20:23.420]  Okay, let's see here.
[20:25.420 --> 20:26.420]  Boom.
[20:27.420 --> 20:30.400]  Yeah.
[20:30.400 --> 20:31.400]  All right. Excellent.
[20:31.400 --> 20:32.400]  Sorry about that.
[20:32.400 --> 20:38.400]  Hey, so one of the first things I wanted to kind of chop it up with you is, you know, how did I dropped off?
[20:39.400 --> 20:41.400]  This is fire.
[20:42.400 --> 20:49.400]  Well, you know, some of the stuff that I feel like that he's been putting out, and I want to when he pops back on here, there we go.
[20:49.400 --> 20:50.400]  There we go.
[20:50.400 --> 20:57.400]  Is, you know, when you were first getting started, you're talking about this list that you had. You mentioned Gage Green and in-house genetics.
[20:57.400 --> 21:03.400]  How did you, especially when you were first starting out, know that those were going to be the ones that you really wanted to ride the train with?
[21:03.400 --> 21:12.400]  Because I feel like even some of us that came on after you, sir, and the ones that continue past us, there was just so many genetics to choose from.
[21:12.400 --> 21:14.400]  You really had to grow them out and see for yourself.
[21:14.400 --> 21:18.400]  You know, so many of your peers would say that this certain breeder, it harms out.
[21:18.400 --> 21:19.400]  Fuck that guy.
[21:19.400 --> 21:23.400]  And then the other squad would say, I found some good genetics through that stuff.
[21:23.400 --> 21:35.400]  And so it seemed like unless you had deep pockets or maybe a large facility like you had mentioned, it was really hard for somebody that was trying to get things done, maybe in a basement or a tent grow to really grow the genetics that they were truly after.
[21:35.400 --> 21:41.400]  Especially back then, spending the kind of money we did at some of those expos that were going around town.
[21:41.400 --> 21:50.400]  So how did you, sir, know that Gage Green, in-house genetics, the list that you were making, those were the ones that you wanted to continue and work with and continue to work from?
[21:50.400 --> 21:53.400]  Yeah, it's a great question. Thanks, bro.
[21:53.400 --> 21:59.400]  You know, to start off, to make the list, I think it was kind of a two part question.
[21:59.400 --> 22:02.400]  How I came up with the people to make the list.
[22:02.400 --> 22:05.400]  Basically, reputation.
[22:05.400 --> 22:07.400]  I looked around.
[22:07.400 --> 22:08.400]  I listened.
[22:08.400 --> 22:13.400]  I was already in the industry and some of these people were already my friends.
[22:13.400 --> 22:17.400]  So word of mouth, reputation, pictures.
[22:17.400 --> 22:20.400]  I mean, tell a thousand words when I see some quality genetics.
[22:20.400 --> 22:22.400]  I mean, I can see that from a mile away. Right.
[22:22.400 --> 22:28.400]  When you see something, even if it's just a picture on Instagram, you can tell that that's in fire.
[22:28.400 --> 22:31.400]  You know, I mean, you can see and most of the time she's going to stink.
[22:31.400 --> 22:36.400]  She looks like that. She's going to stink and she's going to be a winner.
[22:36.400 --> 22:39.400]  So basically reputation. Of course, I did my research.
[22:39.400 --> 22:44.400]  Of course, I knew who was big in the industry.
[22:44.400 --> 22:49.400]  So I'd say reputation was the number one factor that and then people that I knew word of mouth.
[22:49.400 --> 22:56.400]  Reputation was was most weighted in that consideration, although I did definitely look people up.
[22:56.400 --> 22:59.400]  I definitely did my research.
[22:59.400 --> 23:04.400]  And then when I started reaching out to people to kind of segue into the second part of your question there,
[23:04.400 --> 23:11.400]  when I started reaching out to certain breeders, you know, you can tell just just the interaction you have with people.
[23:11.400 --> 23:14.400]  If you're going to vibrate with them or not, you know, which is cool.
[23:14.400 --> 23:20.400]  Some people are going to vibe. Some aren't. Some people just aren't, you know, aren't meant to work together.
[23:20.400 --> 23:25.400]  And that's that's cool. So kind of looking for indications of that early on.
[23:25.400 --> 23:31.400]  So we are investing our time with people that we wanted to be in with, you know, long term.
[23:32.400 --> 23:36.400]  So there were a lot of breeders that were very kind and very loving.
[23:36.400 --> 23:40.400]  And that's what we're looking for. We're looking for people who are real.
[23:40.400 --> 23:45.400]  Of course, we're in business. You got to make cash to stay in business.
[23:45.400 --> 23:50.400]  But I want people who are, you know, love centric and who care about the people.
[23:50.400 --> 23:56.400]  You know, it's one of the reasons we made a commitment to answer every DM we get on Instagram.
[23:56.400 --> 24:01.400]  And we have. There's not ever been one DM that we haven't answered.
[24:01.400 --> 24:10.400]  I don't I don't think there's even one. And by the way, the the Instagram account you have up there is the old one.
[24:10.400 --> 24:14.400]  That one we got locked out of like two or three years ago.
[24:14.400 --> 24:17.400]  And I forgot my password and got a new phone at the same time.
[24:17.400 --> 24:24.400]  So that's what I mean by tenacity, sir, is that you got I think you got five or six of them floating out there.
[24:24.400 --> 24:32.400]  Fifty three Instagrams we've had. I've had forty eight of them, forty nine of them deleted over the past year.
[24:32.400 --> 24:38.400]  So, yeah, it's a sign of love, man. You know, if you if you don't get deleted, you're not loved.
[24:38.400 --> 24:44.400]  That's right. You're not doing anything big. So 53, I think I should get the crown or a trophy or something.
[24:44.400 --> 24:49.400]  Definitely most. Yeah. I believe I want to jump in here, brother.
[24:49.400 --> 24:56.400]  First off, start with what you said. Respect. I got a lot of respect for you, man.
[24:56.400 --> 24:59.400]  I could tell like I just recently been following you, man.
[24:59.400 --> 25:06.400]  And right away when I when I saw your page and genetics and I just I just knew something was was jumping there.
[25:06.400 --> 25:13.400]  And so respect. Yeah. Respect to you as the cultivator and the breeder.
[25:13.400 --> 25:19.400]  I'm not a breeder, man. I really with Virginia just getting online here recently.
[25:19.400 --> 25:23.400]  So that's one of the reasons I'm really excited to talk to you, man.
[25:23.400 --> 25:31.400]  You dropped so many gems. I think one of the big ones was for folks that are listening and you're wanting to get to the level that this man is on.
[25:31.400 --> 25:36.400]  If you think back, the first thing he said was he didn't have a lot of money.
[25:36.400 --> 25:41.400]  He wanted to get in the game. So he offered up his facility to do testing.
[25:41.400 --> 25:46.400]  I think that's huge, man. Freaking smart. And and much respect for that.
[25:46.400 --> 25:52.400]  One thing about your 27 point system, man. I think that's awesome.
[25:52.400 --> 25:58.400]  How close have you been? What's your hardest strain? You know where you feel like you've been the closest to your twenty seven hundred.
[25:58.400 --> 26:02.400]  I'm super picky. I'm super picky. But I also am biased.
[26:02.400 --> 26:07.400]  And I love my white truffle. I'm going to smoke her until the day I die.
[26:08.400 --> 26:14.400]  I don't care what anybody says. Twenty, thirty years now, if it's in the blue dream category, I don't care.
[26:14.400 --> 26:18.400]  I'm smoking it. Right. Right. I love white truffle.
[26:18.400 --> 26:23.400]  The highest score is actually the Hawaiian punch.
[26:23.400 --> 26:29.400]  The platinum punch. Number one bread by in-house. That was hunted.
[26:29.400 --> 26:34.400]  And we only hunted. What do we hunt? I think 19, 18 of those seeds.
[26:34.400 --> 26:40.400]  And I found four absolute stunners in there. And they're all a little bit different, too.
[26:40.400 --> 26:46.400]  So it's just amazing. That's an amazing pack. Is that what you feel like you wish you would have grown even more than 19?
[26:46.400 --> 26:50.400]  Are you like that? That that I got out of there is perfect. Bro, I'm good.
[26:50.400 --> 26:56.400]  OK, I don't know. Like, how could it get better than these? Like, honestly, I don't like if you have the time and energy to hunt more of those.
[26:56.400 --> 27:01.400]  Wow. I don't know. I don't even know because it's crazy.
[27:01.400 --> 27:05.400]  I got everything you want. I got the big yielder. I got the super stinky one.
[27:05.400 --> 27:10.400]  I got the super bag of pill. They all have all this attributes. But the highest is the Hawaiian punch.
[27:10.400 --> 27:15.400]  That's platinum punch number one. And she's like twenty four.
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.400]  Sixty eight is her score. So she's it's still pretty far away.
[27:19.400 --> 27:24.400]  She checks off a ton of boxes and she's a stunning, stunning, stunning string.
[27:24.400 --> 27:34.400]  Really beautiful. Smells just like Hawaiian punch. Big fat nugs of aggressive and veg, big, well branched, strong plant.
[27:34.400 --> 27:45.400]  I mean, just just a plant. And if she's easy to grow, you just you know, you put her over there, give her average everything and she'll just astound you like blow you away.
[27:45.400 --> 27:52.400]  Wow. Well, that kind of leads into because I was talking to some folks when I said I was having you on and things.
[27:52.400 --> 27:57.400]  And some folks were, you know, kind of curious about how do you price your cuts?
[27:57.400 --> 28:04.400]  And now really you've kind of already answered that. Twenty seven point inspection as far as grades.
[28:04.400 --> 28:10.400]  And then you're taking, you know, hundreds and thousands of seeds, you know, you're putting in the work.
[28:10.400 --> 28:19.400]  So the work is what is the reason why, folks, if you're wondering, you know, why this man commands high prices, it's because of work he's putting in.
[28:19.400 --> 28:24.400]  And that really shows, brother. I appreciate that. Yeah, definitely.
[28:24.400 --> 28:32.400]  You know, truthfully, a lot of people ask me for like a menu that's not on the menu because they see the top tier and they say, is there something above that?
[28:32.400 --> 28:45.400]  So, you know, my menu starts down at, you know, a price that I think is extremely fair and very competitive and stuff on the bottom of my menu is fire.
[28:45.400 --> 28:53.400]  Absolutely fire. Like, for example, my ice cream cake cut that was gifted to me by heavily connected is absolutely insane.
[28:53.400 --> 28:59.400]  And she's on the lowest me that I have in pricing the gorilla butter.
[28:59.400 --> 29:05.400]  Two number two, which is white truffle sister. She only lost the penal hunt because white truffle was the winner.
[29:05.400 --> 29:12.400]  She's also down there. My divine banana. Number four that I hunted in-house bread.
[29:12.400 --> 29:17.400]  She's down there. My chimera. Number one, which is the white truffle times the creature.
[29:17.400 --> 29:23.400]  She's down. So, you know, I have love for people that don't have like big pockets. That's cool. No problem.
[29:23.400 --> 29:30.400]  That's that's where we all came from. You got to start somewhere. But we also have stuff that is exclusive.
[29:30.400 --> 29:41.400]  And that's one of the reasons it's priced that way. Not only is it worth it, according to my opinion and the twenty seven hundred point grading scale.
[29:41.400 --> 29:56.400]  But there's demand for it. And the people who want to pay that premium for a genetic, you know, part of keeping that valuable is keeping it exclusive for a certain amount of time.
[29:56.400 --> 30:02.400]  I see all my strains. I want to I want everything I select or breed. I want everybody to have it.
[30:03.400 --> 30:11.400]  I think everybody should have white truffle. The way that it works is a new exciting strain comes out. That's hot and hype.
[30:11.400 --> 30:26.400]  The demand is extremely high on that. If it's high on that scale and the demand is high, that's something that would, you know, fit into that to that envelope of being an exotic for the top of the menu pricing.
[30:27.400 --> 30:37.400]  So that stuff there is exciting. It's hype. It's exclusive. There's, you know, one white truffle. When I first released white truffle, I only released sort of three cultivations in the state of Oklahoma.
[30:37.400 --> 30:47.400]  So everybody knew that. And that was part of the the deal. That's part of the prestige of having this cut is for the first year.
[30:48.400 --> 30:53.400]  And that was the agreement that I would only distribute her to three or three other people that they're not going to share with anybody in state.
[30:53.400 --> 31:04.400]  So that in state, they have that exclusivity and having the white truffle on the shelf at that time, you were among the first cultivators in the world to have white truffle commercially available.
[31:04.400 --> 31:13.400]  It's going to sell out. So the benefit is there. The value is there. And if it wasn't, I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to sell clones at that price.
[31:14.400 --> 31:21.400]  But the value is there. The demand is there. And there's people who ask me for higher price stuff. And the only thing that's not on the menu, it's higher prices, the creature.
[31:21.400 --> 31:28.400]  And she's not for everybody. So she's really not she's not something that I really want to sell at all. I like to breed with her.
[31:28.400 --> 31:37.400]  And I think she's really, really funky. And she has hermaphrodite characteristics in some cases. I think growing her commercially is a disaster. You don't want everyone to do that.
[31:38.400 --> 31:49.400]  But breeding with her can be huge, because my whole creature line was fire. Everything I tested was amazing. There were strains that I tested in that line.
[31:49.400 --> 31:55.400]  Every single one I planted as a test plant before I released the seeds was a winner. And they're on my menu.
[31:56.400 --> 32:12.400]  Chimera. I mean, every single seed I planted was a winner on my 2700 point list. So I mean, it's Yeah, I'm very, very happy and proud. The chimera is a beautiful strain.
[32:12.400 --> 32:24.400]  And she sold out the seed sold out in less than an hour. They sold out probably in like 20 minutes. I thought I had a good amount of them. But I guess not. So I'm doing a second round of that.
[32:26.400 --> 32:36.400]  I'm just doing the same exact cross, reversing the creature hitting the white truffle. And we'll have a bunch more seeds this time. So people have another chance to get on her because I again, I want everybody to have this stuff.
[32:37.400 --> 32:50.400]  And that's another reason we started breeding is because I realized that not everybody has that, you know, that big budget to grab those big genetics. So, you know, we want to want to make sure that everybody can get a taste of that belief gear.
[32:51.400 --> 33:05.400]  So the seed packs come out, they're very reasonable in price. If you're cultivating, you can definitely afford a seed pack, hopefully. And you get that going and you're gonna be good, especially a pack of chimera or the data, everything, every one of the testers.
[33:06.400 --> 33:26.400]  Of my data cross, which is my love seed 2291 times the creature. Every single one was a winner. The Kool-Aid man, every seed I planted was a winner. I've got more of them in testing now. So we'll see what happens with the rest of the crosses. But there was 21 crosses in there and there's just winners everywhere. It's really fun.
[33:27.400 --> 33:30.400]  Exciting. I'll be on the stream of seed packs for sure.
[33:30.400 --> 33:31.400]  Thank you, Rasta.
[33:31.400 --> 33:46.400]  There's two of the ones that I wanted to talk about you further that you had just mentioned. So so we don't lose that train of thought. Can we go deeper into the data? Number one, I had that written down. The Kool-Aid man and the Nova gas was really sticking out when I was doing extra research on you.
[33:46.400 --> 34:09.400]  Yeah, so sexy. That's the one I'm gonna get. I'm gonna grab some of this bro. The Nova. I got you. The Nova gas is insane. She. I mean, so just to give a bit of background, all three of those are crosses off the creature, right? That's my creature line. That's the first line I've bred to sell.
[34:10.400 --> 34:32.400]  Before that, I had just a couple of branches. I took a here and there. So this is this is my first line. The creature. So the reason I chose the creature is because she's she's a little different. If you guys haven't seen pictures of her, check out my Instagram pages. It's belief loves Canada and believe Canada love on Instagram.
[34:33.400 --> 34:58.400]  We're on Reddit and Twitter and Facebook is belief cannabis. Check out the pictures of the creature because she's I mean, she's like this. She's got these long genetic fox tails. I make her extremely unique. And the fox tailing does occur when plants are stressed through heat, particularly sativa plants will will foxtail from heat stress.
[34:59.400 --> 35:06.400]  That's not what we're talking about here. This is genetic foxtailing. Perfect. Excellent. Look at that. Oh, so sexy.
[35:07.400 --> 35:08.400]  Oh, I'm in love with her so much.
[35:09.400 --> 35:32.400]  Yeah. So you can see one of the ways you can tell if foxtailing is genetic or heat induced is the number of trichomes, the amount of trichomes given that strain that are on the foxtails, heat induced foxtailing. You're not going to get this type of trichome consistency. You're not going to get trichomes all up and down those long foxtails.
[35:33.400 --> 35:48.400]  So the reason we love her so much, besides the fact that she's a thank you for that video. That was great. Good job. Yes. Part of the reason we select her in addition to her unique blood structure is her profile is just amazing. She smells like tropical.
[35:49.400 --> 35:58.400]  Like if you're walking through a tropical fruit orchard and it's there's just the smells of warm fruit and fruit blossoms and it's very floral and fruity and tropical.
[35:59.400 --> 36:14.400]  And then they're just boom. You get hit with this nail salon, like nail polish remover, just like funky chemical gassy thing going on. It's in the background. It's like 15 percent, 20 percent of the overall experience and the aroma.
[36:14.400 --> 36:25.400]  But it's just it's just lovely, lovely, lovely. And she imparts that that profile very well. And most of her crosses are going to find a lot of these.
[36:26.400 --> 36:39.400]  The first wave that I released because I'm testing this in three different rooms, actually. So we're releasing it in three different waves. Wave one was already released. We're going to be releasing wave two in about 20 days.
[36:39.400 --> 36:53.400]  And then wave three will be in about 40 days. But a lot of them are leaning towards the creature in the turf profile that we're getting like orange tic tacs and smarties and some tropical fruit.
[36:53.400 --> 37:05.400]  But it's mostly like powdery dry candy. It smells a lot like my Dippin' Sticks. That's funny. But it's kind of like a powdery, sweet, fruity thing that is overwhelmingly the predominant turpentine in these crosses.
[37:06.400 --> 37:21.400]  But then you've got each of these other cuts adding their little their little unique signature to that. The creature also, before I move on, is a very aggressive vegetative plant. She's very huge. She's a huge producer.
[37:22.400 --> 37:39.400]  Commercially, again, she has intersex traits. We have grown her with with no herms, but we've also grown her and we've had some herms. So that's one of the reasons I don't sell her and I don't really need or want to sell her.
[37:40.400 --> 37:52.400]  And that's really why I started breeding with her. And I really didn't know how it would turn out. I didn't know if these herms would carry over or not. It's really why I did a lot of testing on these before I released them. I tested them all the way through.
[37:52.400 --> 38:04.400]  And that's why I'm doing them in three waves because I want to make sure I do enough of each strain to really give them a thorough test and give them a run for their money because I'm not going to be releasing my first line and have any kind of herms. I don't want any of that.
[38:05.400 --> 38:10.400]  So, I mean, the reversed plant was a plant that had intersex traits.
[38:12.400 --> 38:17.400]  Bro, there were no, there were, let's see.
[38:18.400 --> 38:33.400]  1.7% was the herm rate on the testing so far. So it's extremely low, well within the range. And being the fact that I've grown 40 plus 50 breeders gear.
[38:34.400 --> 38:43.400]  I would say that my herm rate is very, very low and most lower than most all of the stuff that I've tested.
[38:43.400 --> 38:52.400]  I keep track of all the numbers so I know what breeder I know their herm rates on the stuff that I've tested in my environments.
[38:52.400 --> 38:58.400]  I know the most important number for me is number of seeds planted to the number of winners.
[38:59.400 --> 39:06.400]  So if I planted 10 seeds, how many winners I get? So it was a 10 to 1 ratio. Is it a 10 to 4? Is it a 10 to 0?
[39:06.400 --> 39:12.400]  If I planted 100, is it 100 to 5 winners? Is it 100 to 30 winners? What is it?
[39:12.400 --> 39:22.400]  And that's the ratio I keep track of. And that's really how I grade breeders from my personal experience is I want to know how many seeds I have to plant before I get a winner.
[39:23.400 --> 39:30.400]  I'm not super concerned with other issues because a winner is going to cover all that.
[39:30.400 --> 39:36.400]  With my 2700 point grading scale, it's going to cover all the nuances.
[39:36.400 --> 39:43.400]  So I know that my gear is well, well rated among other breeder stuff.
[39:43.400 --> 39:50.400]  I tested it. I know their numbers. I know my numbers. I can say without a doubt I can give exact numbers on all that stuff.
[39:51.400 --> 40:02.400]  Very proud of that. And I'm very pleasingly excited that the herms aren't showing up in these creature classes.
[40:02.400 --> 40:05.400]  So I'm super excited about that. I'm crossing over more stuff now.
[40:05.400 --> 40:12.400]  I guess I'm redoing the chimera and in that room I'm reversing the creature so I threw some other stuff in there.
[40:12.400 --> 40:23.400]  So you said you'll keep a little bit of that same turf profile, even if the bud structure takes on the other plant, the male, she'll still keep that?
[40:23.400 --> 40:31.400]  80% of the turf profiles on the creature cross testers were leaning creature.
[40:31.400 --> 40:40.400]  They were almost all this tropical fruity thing. And then they developed this kind of powdery candy turf in there as well.
[40:40.400 --> 40:47.400]  So it's really, really interesting. Yeah, I'm just super excited with them.
[40:47.400 --> 40:53.400]  Is there anything that when you were crossing with the creature that a commercial farmer could run with?
[40:53.400 --> 41:01.400]  Because I feel like that unique kind of look to it, you know, if you could maybe put off in a little corner or something like that or special spot in your room.
[41:01.400 --> 41:07.400]  I do feel like there's a lot of growers out there that still want to kind of have that unique feature.
[41:08.400 --> 41:20.400]  Yeah. If somebody wanted to do that and they were like willing to listen to me, tell them how to grow the creature for four hours and then like repeat that back to me to make sure they got it all.
[41:20.400 --> 41:30.400]  That's like really the only way I'd feel super comfortable with anybody doing that, because even if they talked to creature in a corner and they had, you know, even a 20 lighter or something, a hundred light, whatever they had.
[41:30.400 --> 41:35.400]  And that creature heard and put out some pollen that could be, you know, it could represent a major problem for them.
[41:35.400 --> 41:46.400]  So I'm just trying to protect those people. I don't want anybody to have a room full of seeds, although a room full of seeds from the creature might be a good thing.
[41:46.400 --> 41:51.400]  Long term, short term, not trying to do that may not be a benefit.
[41:51.400 --> 41:58.400]  The crazy thing and the super cool thing about it is that the creature doesn't foxtail out until day 60.
[41:59.400 --> 42:13.400]  That's when she starts it. So if somebody grew the creature and didn't want the foxtails and they harvested a day 65, they'd have a magnificent stinky trichome encrusted gal that was amazing.
[42:13.400 --> 42:25.400]  And it'll be fine. No problems at all in terms of the additional work required to trim up the creature, because that nug that you just showed that nug there.
[42:25.400 --> 42:33.400]  Excellent. This took my son 45 minutes to trim that nug. And it was like a three gram nug.
[42:34.400 --> 42:42.400]  So it's just not, you know, in that regard, feasible. That's going to cost the trimmer a lot. That's going to cost a lot of money to trim this.
[42:42.400 --> 42:49.400]  But this is the thing with the creature. I would not recommend doing that at all. I would fresh freeze that girl.
[42:50.400 --> 43:03.400]  That's one of the reasons I select her. That's one of the reasons that we went on the first line of breeding with her is because due to these unique foxtailing structures of the buds, what you have is an increased surface area.
[43:03.400 --> 43:11.400]  So if you have this big, chunky bud like this, you know, you only have trichomes predominantly on the outside and these little holes or whatever, the nooks and crannies.
[43:11.400 --> 43:27.400]  But on the inside here, you don't have any trichomes. That's just vegetable material. And it may weigh, but when somebody is buying a pound, if you're buying a bunch of this vegetable material inside these big, chunky nugs that are just trichome encrusted on the outside, then you're losing money, in my opinion.
[43:27.400 --> 43:32.400]  Because you're buying trichomes. The trichome is what we want. We don't want the vegetable material necessarily.
[43:33.400 --> 43:54.400]  So the creature is perfect for fresh frozen and hash production concentrates because you're losing that significant inside amount of the flower material and in favor of this outside and this increased surface area where you have all this trichome.
[43:55.400 --> 44:07.400]  If you have a foxtail shaped like my finger and it weighs a gram, you have significantly more surface area where the trichomes grow to have more trichomes per gram.
[44:07.400 --> 44:14.400]  So when you're talking about fresh frozen, you're talking about the numbers, if you're talking about commercial or for personal use, you're talking about you want the biggest yield, right?
[44:14.400 --> 44:24.400]  Because that's what people say. Hey, they hit me up all the time. Hey, which of your stuff yields? You know, what is anything 5%? Can I get something 6%? What do you have that yields in hash production?
[44:24.400 --> 44:31.400]  So the creature is an answer there. She yields because she's like that. And that's why we've read it through.
[44:31.400 --> 44:58.400]  So breeding with that in mind is what we were thinking there. We wanted to breed stuff that would be better for hash production.
[44:58.400 --> 45:09.400]  So the creature starts doing this really cool foxtailing at day 60. She won't do it before that. She looks like a normal plant in terms of her bud structure.
[45:09.400 --> 45:11.400]  How long does she go?
[45:11.400 --> 45:12.400]  What's that, bro?
[45:12.400 --> 45:14.400]  How long does she go?
[45:14.400 --> 45:17.400]  The bud in this picture went 105 days.
[45:17.400 --> 45:19.400]  Oh, OK.
[45:20.400 --> 45:36.400]  So this is the super cool thing about this plant. And another reason I'm absolutely in love with her. From day 70 to day 105 and probably even further, because if you look closely at this video, there's white hairs still because she's just a freak.
[45:36.400 --> 45:41.400]  Like she's spitting out new pistols at day 90.
[45:41.400 --> 45:43.400]  That's wild.
[45:43.400 --> 45:50.400]  I've taken her 105 days. That's enough for me. Like someday I'm going to take her longer and I don't know what will happen.
[45:50.400 --> 45:57.400]  But this is the great thing that I found with the crosses is this was a question I had. Like, are all the crosses going to need 105 days?
[45:57.400 --> 46:07.400]  No, absolutely not. We have crosses. Chimera one finishes in 56 days. Right. She's done. Done. Not going to do anything else.
[46:08.400 --> 46:18.400]  She's the exception. There's a lot of other plants that on day 60, they started to do what the creature did and started to kick out little foxtail little nubs at first.
[46:18.400 --> 46:22.400]  It looked like, oh, gee, you know, these big swollen calyxes and then bigger and bigger.
[46:22.400 --> 46:25.400]  And also, you know, yep, there it is. Got you.
[46:25.400 --> 46:34.400]  And like by day 75 or so, it's a foxtail, you know, and that's where I stopped on these testers.
[46:34.400 --> 46:38.400]  But if you keep going, you can get more of that foxtail.
[46:38.400 --> 46:43.400]  And I'm looking at the trichomes and I'm looking at the amber and the percentage and she'll keep going.
[46:43.400 --> 46:51.400]  Most of these crosses, most of these phenos in these packs, you have like this this time for time frame of harvesting.
[46:51.400 --> 46:59.400]  You don't have like, OK, it's day 65. It's done. Right. It's day 65 to 105 plus.
[46:59.400 --> 47:10.400]  As far as I can tell, I haven't taken all these all these crosses past 75 days, but from the indications I got that they were starting to and continuing to foxtail all the way to the chop at day 75.
[47:10.400 --> 47:16.400]  I believe that they would continue going on and on and on and and foxtail just like their mom.
[47:16.400 --> 47:21.400]  So we're going to grow some of those out. But right now, not necessarily.
[47:21.400 --> 47:25.400]  So we got a question here. Is the creature an indoor plant only?
[47:25.400 --> 47:29.400]  I would say no. I would say no, not at all.
[47:29.400 --> 47:36.400]  If you know what you're doing with her and, you know. It's the right time of the year and the weather is right.
[47:36.400 --> 47:44.400]  I think you can do very well to creature. I can say you probably could get through an outdoor, you know, full sun run with with no herms.
[47:44.400 --> 47:48.400]  You would just really know how to have to know how to take care of her.
[47:48.400 --> 47:52.400]  She's she's a very, very picky girl. She's extremely high maintenance.
[47:52.400 --> 47:58.400]  She's yeah, I've grown her many, many times and I still don't really get her, but I kind of get her.
[47:58.400 --> 48:00.400]  But you know, you love her.
[48:00.400 --> 48:06.400]  I knew that on day 68. The first time I grew up, I was like, wow, what is she doing?
[48:06.400 --> 48:09.400]  Like, she's going to keep doing this. And we pushed the whole room for her.
[48:09.400 --> 48:13.400]  There was eighteen hundred fricking plants in that room. We pushed the whole room for her.
[48:13.400 --> 48:17.400]  White truffle. What's what? What happens? White truffle. 105 days.
[48:18.400 --> 48:23.400]  Well, after day 75, she stops maturing. And for me, she held firm.
[48:23.400 --> 48:27.400]  She was fricking fire and didn't change at all. She didn't go downhill at all.
[48:27.400 --> 48:32.400]  She got a little more amber than we would have liked, but the fresh frozen was still white.
[48:32.400 --> 48:36.400]  Like so it wasn't expired. It wasn't overdue.
[48:36.400 --> 48:39.400]  So, yeah, so it's kind of an interesting experience.
[48:39.400 --> 48:42.400]  You know, it's take everybody in that room. One hundred and five days.
[48:42.400 --> 48:47.400]  We cut out maybe 40 or 50 plants that were done, done and dying on the vine and stuff like that.
[48:47.400 --> 48:55.400]  But yeah. So to kind of answer your question, Brian, about the different pheno or the different crosses.
[48:55.400 --> 49:02.400]  Yeah. So Nova gas is gas and aid times the creature gas.
[49:02.400 --> 49:08.400]  She's also known as love seed two point two to one.
[49:08.400 --> 49:14.400]  Her name is gas and a because she she tastes and smells like limeade and gasoline.
[49:14.400 --> 49:19.400]  Nothing else. Very clean. Easy to define. Straight up turps.
[49:19.400 --> 49:23.400]  I've grown many times and she always smells the same. Very, very cool.
[49:23.400 --> 49:26.400]  Other people grow her and they always it's always the same.
[49:26.400 --> 49:29.400]  Sometimes she goes more towards like lime syrup and so forth.
[49:29.400 --> 49:38.400]  But that's typically where she stays. So the the Nova gas is is crazy.
[49:38.400 --> 49:49.400]  You there's a nice little variance of phenos to you got the medium to large producers that are just insanely tricone crusted that kind of are shaped like those old O.G.
[49:49.400 --> 49:54.400]  with again with the big swollen calyxes and not quite foxtails.
[49:54.400 --> 50:02.400]  And then there's other phenos that are just big golf ball, just nice, fat, solid, dense nugs that stink as well.
[50:02.400 --> 50:15.400]  The turps range from, again, from that limeade and lime syrup, especially especially lime syrup into kerosene and a little bit of nail polish remover.
[50:16.400 --> 50:23.400]  Real gassy, real sweet. Some phenos have all the lime and limeade and not much gas.
[50:23.400 --> 50:27.400]  And some of them have a ton of gas and a little bit of lime in the back.
[50:27.400 --> 50:32.400]  And some are just perfect marriages of both. And I love all the phenos.
[50:32.400 --> 50:37.400]  So the Nova gas was fun. Super sexy.
[50:37.400 --> 50:47.400]  And then you also asked about the data, which is love seed to two point two nine one times the creature.
[50:47.400 --> 50:53.400]  So, yeah, there you go. Yeah, that's the chunkier.
[50:53.400 --> 50:57.400]  This girl smelled all like lime, straight lime syrup.
[50:57.400 --> 51:03.400]  She's a big, fat, chunky girl. Now, keep in mind, when you see these buds on my page,
[51:03.400 --> 51:09.400]  these are mostly, you know, once again, four inch spacing or grown in four inch pots to finish flowering.
[51:09.400 --> 51:16.400]  So these are small plants. So all this bud might not be, you know, as big as your forearm.
[51:16.400 --> 51:19.400]  You put in a big pot and it will be. The node spacing is there.
[51:19.400 --> 51:25.400]  The genetic ability to make this a gigantic nug is there.
[51:25.400 --> 51:32.400]  I think it's kind of important to talk a little bit about what the love seeds are, because some people know, but some people don't.
[51:32.400 --> 51:39.400]  And we're talking about data. She's a love seed times the creature, which is also a love seed.
[51:39.400 --> 51:45.400]  And gas and a love seed. So the love seeds are some of them have been named.
[51:45.400 --> 51:51.400]  So it's a.k.a. So gas and aid is a.k.a. love seed to point two to one.
[51:51.400 --> 51:54.400]  So when we grew them out, they got a number.
[51:54.400 --> 52:01.400]  And then if if we really loved them and they had a distinct personality that we can easily name,
[52:01.400 --> 52:06.400]  we named them as well. So the creature was one of these love seeds and we named her that because of the way she grows.
[52:06.400 --> 52:12.400]  And she's just a huge, very aggressive, tall, big, huge yielding plant.
[52:12.400 --> 52:18.400]  So basically what happened is I had a farm that I was consulting some of my buddies in Oregon.
[52:18.400 --> 52:22.400]  It was an eight acre farm several years back.
[52:22.400 --> 52:29.400]  And we were doing a large phenol. It was about four or five hundred seeds that we were phenol at that time.
[52:29.400 --> 52:35.400]  And we were kind of off the grid. We had a large greenhouse that we were hunting in.
[52:35.400 --> 52:42.400]  And then we had an indoor room, I think about thirty five or forty lights that we were hunting in.
[52:42.400 --> 52:49.400]  And the phenol plants were kind of spread out. And this was still when I was doing larger plants, you know, larger plants.
[52:49.400 --> 52:55.400]  So that December of that year was a really, really severe winter.
[52:56.400 --> 53:03.400]  And, you know, being off the grid, our power was unreliable. We had the indoor room.
[53:03.400 --> 53:07.400]  The power went out three times catastrophically. Very bad.
[53:07.400 --> 53:16.400]  One time was for eight hours and our generator couldn't, you know, supply energy for the whole for the whole for the whole farm.
[53:16.400 --> 53:22.400]  Because we had several large greenhouses as well. So quite a few of the tester plants in that room,
[53:22.400 --> 53:30.400]  a large majority of them, harmed out due to the lights, the erratic nature, right at the wrong time and flower,
[53:30.400 --> 53:35.400]  hundreds of plants, and they all just kind of pollinated each other.
[53:35.400 --> 53:40.400]  So it's kind of like an open pollinated pollination thing.
[53:40.400 --> 53:46.400]  And so basically we harvested a lot of the buds and some of them didn't have any seeds.
[53:46.400 --> 53:48.400]  Some of them had a moderate amount of seeds. Some of them had a ton of seeds.
[53:49.400 --> 53:53.400]  So all the buds that had any large amount of seeds, obviously, we were taking the seeds out.
[53:53.400 --> 53:58.400]  We saved them all. We put them in a big bag and we named them love seeds.
[53:58.400 --> 54:04.400]  And there were two moms that were extremely fire that were heavily pregnant.
[54:04.400 --> 54:10.400]  So we separated those and we named those love seeds, jelly gelato and love seed jelly breath.
[54:10.400 --> 54:13.400]  And those are the only two that we knew where the moms were.
[54:13.400 --> 54:17.400]  Other than that, we just kind of put them all in the same bag.
[54:17.400 --> 54:20.400]  We weren't really expecting much from those seeds.
[54:20.400 --> 54:25.400]  We didn't really have a plan for the seed. It was looked at very much as most people do as an accident at that point.
[54:25.400 --> 54:32.400]  And we weren't planning on planting them or expecting to reap anything out of those seeds.
[54:32.400 --> 54:44.400]  I had previously in that hunt, I planted 36 seeds that I had acquired from a previous test room
[54:44.400 --> 54:50.400]  in which several of the plants harmed in that room out of hundreds, two or three of them harmed
[54:50.400 --> 54:54.400]  and impregnated several lower branches on a couple of plants.
[54:54.400 --> 54:58.400]  We took those seeds and there were about a hundred of those.
[54:58.400 --> 55:00.400]  We planted 36 of them up in Oregon.
[55:00.400 --> 55:05.400]  And I didn't assign them much value because it's like bag seed, right?
[55:05.400 --> 55:11.400]  Or an accidental seed or people are saying it's going to harm, like all the seeds are going to be hermey seeds.
[55:11.400 --> 55:14.400]  So we didn't think they were going to be very valuable.
[55:14.400 --> 55:17.400]  And so I named them river seeds.
[55:17.400 --> 55:24.400]  And I was like, well, we'll just throw them down by the river, you know, in springtime and we'll come back.
[55:24.400 --> 55:27.400]  We'll see what happens, you know, because they're just not valuable seeds.
[55:27.400 --> 55:31.400]  Who cares? They're just seeds that came from some herm plant and it was a test or whatever.
[55:31.400 --> 55:39.400]  So we planted 36 of those in Oregon and we labeled them river seed one through 36.
[55:39.400 --> 55:44.400]  And as people would come visit the farm or they would see pictures of it,
[55:44.400 --> 55:52.400]  we'd explain to them that the river seed meant that basically it was some seed that I had not assigned much value to.
[55:52.400 --> 55:57.400]  I didn't really think was going to be that good, but we just figured we'd plant them.
[55:57.400 --> 56:02.400]  Ends up that out of those 36, none of them were winners at all.
[56:02.400 --> 56:07.400]  Not even close. None of them, there were no value from my standpoint.
[56:07.400 --> 56:15.400]  They might have high CBG or something like this, but from my standpoint for bag of pill and stink and medicinal properties and headiness,
[56:15.400 --> 56:21.400]  they weren't winners at all. And there were plenty that are winners in the room, even though the room got pregnant.
[56:21.400 --> 56:29.400]  So when that room herned and we got all those seeds, that bad winter, and we collected all those,
[56:29.400 --> 56:33.400]  we decided to not call them river seeds.
[56:33.400 --> 56:43.400]  I thought that maybe just calling them river seeds and treating them as if they were no value affected them.
[56:43.400 --> 56:48.400]  And I came up with this because kind of at the same time, although I had read it before,
[56:48.400 --> 56:54.400]  I was reading a book called The Hidden Messages of Water. It's written by Matsuro Emoto.
[56:54.400 --> 57:07.400]  He's a Japanese doctor who was trying in experiments to prove or disprove if emotions and human thoughts had an effect on physical reality.
[57:07.400 --> 57:13.400]  So what he did was he took some water. He took 10 samples of water from the same source.
[57:13.400 --> 57:21.400]  They're all the same water. He put them in a beaker and he labeled them and he put a single word on each sample of water.
[57:21.400 --> 57:32.400]  And he put words that were designed to invoke emotions and emotional responses from the individuals that he then had go in and look at these different vessels of water.
[57:32.400 --> 57:39.400]  One of them said love. One of them said hate. One of them said murder. The other one said care. The other one said thank you.
[57:39.400 --> 57:47.400]  So there were a bunch of different words. He had a series of people come through individually and look at those and just look at the water.
[57:48.400 --> 57:54.400]  That's all they were instructed to do, just look at the water. And obviously they read the words which invoked an emotional response.
[57:54.400 --> 58:03.400]  And he wanted to see if that emotional response, the vibration of that emotional response, would have an impact on the physical matter of the water.
[58:03.400 --> 58:08.400]  So he took the water samples after this experiment and froze them.
[58:08.400 --> 58:14.400]  And then he looked at the water crystals that were formed when he froze the samples of water.
[58:14.400 --> 58:26.400]  And what he found was extraordinary. He found that the water that had the word love on it formed beautiful, geometrically perfect snowflake.
[58:26.400 --> 58:34.400]  You guys are awesome. Look at this. Look at wisdom and thank you. Look at this. This is what happened with this water test.
[58:34.400 --> 58:38.400]  And then he wrote yes, he wrote you fool and I will kill you on other water.
[58:38.400 --> 58:44.400]  The one that says I kill you, if you zoom in, I don't know if you can, but if you ever zoom into that one, it looks like a guy with a gun.
[58:44.400 --> 58:52.400]  This is what happened when he froze this water. It's absolutely stunning.
[58:52.400 --> 58:59.400]  So I kind of had an epiphany. I was thinking, you know, maybe just naming them river seeds, compromise.
[58:59.400 --> 59:05.400]  I've never grown 36 plants and never had something that was not even close to a winner. None of them were even close.
[59:05.400 --> 59:09.400]  They were like the most basic ganja, really, really basic.
[59:09.400 --> 59:16.400]  And so we decided to flip the script. We decided to change it up and write love seed on them.
[59:16.400 --> 59:21.400]  Everybody looks at them. Every time you look at them, it's love seed, love seed, love seed, love seed.
[59:21.400 --> 59:28.400]  Everybody's putting love out there. So we named them. We had two different rooms, as I stated, the indoor room and the greenhouse.
[59:29.400 --> 59:33.400]  So we named them love seed two and love seed three. Love seed three was all from the greenhouse.
[59:33.400 --> 59:38.400]  Love seed two was all from the indoor room. And then when we planted them, we planted the first batch.
[59:38.400 --> 59:43.400]  We planted like 130 of them. So we had to name them, so we numbered them.
[59:43.400 --> 59:52.400]  So love seed, like the first seed we planted from the indoor room, which was love seed two, we named 2.001.
[59:52.400 --> 01:00:00.400]  And then it was 2.002, 2.003, et cetera. And then the ones that came from the greenhouse were labeled three point.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:08.400]  So 3.001 or 3.002, et cetera. So that's how those are all named. That's the story of the love seeds.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:17.400]  And then basically when we got to Oklahoma, more than two years, a little more than two years ago, we started planting them.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.400]  And we labeled them and they said love on them and everybody saw them.
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:28.400]  And it was like freaking stunning because they came from different rooms. They came from different genetics.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:38.400]  But the ratio of winners versus plants, the seeds planted in that batch of love seed was off the chart.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.400]  Absolutely off the chart. There were so many freaking winners. It was incredible.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:52.400]  So we decided from that point forward, if we ever have any kind of seeds like this, to name them love seeds or miracle seeds or something like that.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:56.400]  So that's where the love seeds came from. The creature is one of those love seeds.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:05.400]  She's number 2.260. So she was the 260th plant in the ongoing hunt of love seeds.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:12.400]  And I still have some of these. I still have I think about 50 or 75 of the love seed 2 point whatever.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:18.400]  But yeah, the gas and eight is a love seed. The creature is a love seed.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:24.400]  I have red hots is a love seed. The cosmic peanut butter is a love seed.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:30.400]  There's a bunch of the strawberry jelly is a love seed. There were a bunch of them.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.400]  So I really wanted to utilize as many of those in my breeding projects as possible.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:43.400]  And we did. And the lines after the creature have even more and more of these love seeds in them because they're just amazing.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:48.400]  And they came to me in a miraculous fashion. So I definitely honor them.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:56.400]  That's pretty awesome, man. Same bag of seeds, river seeds versus love seeds and make that much difference.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.400]  That's awesome. I believe it, man. I always feel like we are nature.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.400]  And so many things are interconnected that we don't even know or realize.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:09.400]  Yeah, there's a lot we don't understand for sure. Plenty. Yeah, Rasta.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.400]  So so basically that's a that's kind of where the love seeds came from.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:21.400]  The creature line is something that working now. I've got the white truffle line, which we did 26 crosses with white truffle.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:27.400]  We reversed the white truffle. So that'll be a thin line. We hit 26 of my favorite girls.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:33.400]  So that's in testing now. Those plants are going to go into flower real soon.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.400]  Therefore, by four inch spacing in a raised bed, grassroots fabric bed.
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.400]  And they're looking amazing. So we're going to run those.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:48.400]  And we have the dip and sticks line, which is another reversal line, a thin line.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:57.400]  That is at day 56 of flower. So all the girls are well pregnant and busting the seeds all over the place.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:04.400]  I crossed 36 or 38 plants with dip and sticks in that line.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:11.400]  Five or six of them won't be commercially available, but the others, as long as they pass testing, will be.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:17.400]  So there will be, you know, upwards of 25 to 30 dip and sticks crosses coming real soon.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:24.400]  And I've got the truffle loa going as well. I'm doing a reversal on that.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:29.400]  The truffle loa was was just me playing around.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:36.400]  I had some platinum punch one, the Hawaiian punch pollen that my buddy Rock Bud sent me.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:43.400]  I sent him the plant. He reversed it, did the platinum Gucci and a couple other crosses with it, which turned out stunning.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:48.400]  And he sent me some of the pollen. So I've been sprinkling girls here and there with the pollen.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.400]  So, yeah, it was about nine months ago that I sprinkled.
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:55.400]  I sprinkled the white truffle that was in a flower room.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:59.400]  I sprinkled just a couple of little nubs with some of that pollen.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.400]  And that is what now is called truffle loa.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.400]  So it's white truffle and the Hawaiian punch cut. So it's truffle loa.
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:13.400]  And we had 12 of those seeds. I planted 12 and I have four winners. They're stunning.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.400]  I'm trying not to be biased with my own gear. That's the correct one. Thank you, Rasta.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.400]  But it was just stunning.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:36.400]  Phenol number one smells like. It smells like the best version of earthy mushroom cotton candy that you can ever imagine with a little bit of gas in the background.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.400]  Super, super cool. Like very cool turps.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:48.400]  Truffle loa number 10. It smells very similar to truffle without like the peanut butter and the earthy garlic thing.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.400]  It smells like just like the gas, like kerosene that the truffle has.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.400]  Truffle loa number two and three were also winners.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:07.400]  Number two smells like almost like rubber, not quite burnt rubber, but like a more like a rubber tree and earth with a little bit of that cotton candy.
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.400]  And then number three smells bright. It's all bright fruit.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:16.400]  It smells almost exactly like the Hawaiian punch with just a touch of tire.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:22.400]  And all of our all of these finishing out around the 63 day mark.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:27.400]  Yeah. So it's about 63 days to get that. I mean, that's.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:33.400]  That's amazing. He had the next level, man. Yes. Yes. That's why we're here.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:39.400]  This man is next level. So let's let's dive, Marco, if you're cool with it, man.
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.400]  Let's dive a little more deeper into like your growing process.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:52.400]  I know that's something like Marco and I myself have our pen and paper to pick your brain, because I feel like a lot of us would love to kind of know how you started out, how you kind of went through.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:56.400]  And now your process, you know, working with the raised beds and that kind of thing.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:03.400]  Or if I can jump in and tag in on that, I was I've been thinking about that question, too, as you've been speaking.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:08.400]  So or are you just sufficient?
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:19.400]  You know, you're good with just a sufficient soil and grow medium, not putting too much effort there and wanting to plant to just give you all it can give you without a lot of help, if that makes sense.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:27.400]  I like I look at my my raised beds as a blank canvas, the cocoa and the peat moss.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:37.400]  I have that so that the pH is right. If I take my mix and I pour six point zero water through it and I test the runoff of the bottom and come through at six point zero.
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.400]  So as a baseline, it's there's nothing there.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:52.400]  And that's the way I work, because I want to be able to adjust my inputs, my nutrient inputs, according to what the plants are doing.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:58.400]  Now, even though my rooms are dialed for the most part, there are variables still that affect it.
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:06.400]  So if anything changes in a room that's perfectly dialed, if something goes up over here, then it's got to go.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.400]  You know, it's got to go over here. It's got to balance out.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:31.400]  So having the blank slate that I can feed now, if I see any kind of nutrient deficiency or overage coming, I fix it very early, very early, because I have this blank slate and I do runoffs in flower every time before I feed.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:37.400]  There might be a few exceptions. You know, I'm super busy or I know what the plant is on a consistent thing.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:41.400]  But 95 percent of time I'm doing runoffs before I feed.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:47.400]  So having this blank slate and doing the runoffs tells me what to feed them every single time.
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:52.400]  In the future, I'm going to be automating this. The technology is already really there.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:59.400]  But the hands on approach is basically I just take that six point zero water at zero ppm and I just keep pouring it through the top slowly.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:05.400]  I capture it and I measure it. And that's going to tell me what I'm feeding.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:15.400]  Right. So I like to have that blank slate so I can adjust according to any kind of variables that come up so we can keep that balance.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:29.400]  I don't want the plant and flower working. I don't want to putting her energy towards staying cool or or staying warm or protecting herself from wind or from an obtrusive neighbor.
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:33.400]  I want her just to focus on being the best flower she can.
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:44.400]  So I'm going to take all that stress off of her and just do just leave her to be fired.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:49.400]  Yeah. Yeah. Does that answer your question?
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.400]  Yeah, that's dope. That's kind of what I was thinking, man.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:09:02.400]  It makes a lot of sense. And then someone like myself, you know, who is a natural farmer, who's all deep down into the smallest of the microbes and all that.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:09.400]  Then I feel like then we could even take that plant even farther because you've I mean, look what you're doing, you know, just kind of at that baseline.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:12.400]  And I know you're measuring and doing your thing with the nutrients.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:19.400]  But I mean, I respect that a lot, you know, I mean, because it's tough being, you know, kind of natural farming.
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:24.400]  And I mean, you're a breeder, you know what I mean? You have a lot, you know, that you got to really focus on.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.400]  I get it. So, yeah. Much respect, man.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.400]  Thank you. I appreciate that. Yeah, it's become a lot more complex.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:39.400]  You know, we're doing concentrates, we're breeding, we got major clone sales, you know, growing flower.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:45.400]  There's a lot of different avenues that we're attempting to excel at.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.400]  So I'm glad that, you know, you're seeing some value in that.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:54.400]  I love the raised beds because I like the plants to communicate the roots all intertwined.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:01.400]  You know that when a certain cannabis plant is deficient in a nutrient, she's going to ask her neighbors for it.
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:11.400]  And they'll lend nutrients to each other. If there's some kind of reason to be concerned, if there was a pest of any sort on one plant,
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:15.400]  that can be communicated through the roots to the next plant.
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:20.400]  And when we have, for example, in one of the phenol room where the creature came from,
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.400]  we had 25 foot long beds that were four foot wide and three foot deep.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:28.400]  So you could potentially have roots that go that whole 25 feet.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.400]  I don't think they would. I don't think they need to. But they definitely could.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:36.400]  And I think in some cases they did. I would think that the creature's roots got to both ends.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.400]  There were a couple of other plants that I would think got to both ends.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.400]  I just love them being able to communicate and touch roots naturally.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.400]  Like the analogy I use, like when you go into the forest, you don't see any pots.
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:50.400]  There you go.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:55.400]  And like you said before, Marco, is that there's a lot we don't understand.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.400]  So until we get it, like I would just rather emulate nature.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:05.400]  Like until I know everything about roots that I would need to know to make a really informed decision,
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:10.400]  and all the science that we don't have the technology to observe at this point,
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:13.400]  I'm just going to emulate nature and let nature do its thing.
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:16.400]  That's not to say we don't use pots, of course.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.400]  We have a lot of clones that go out, and a lot of them are in four-inch pots.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.400]  I do have flowering rooms that are in pots.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:28.400]  I do have a couple of small phenohunt rooms that we do in four-inch or half-gallon pots.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:32.400]  But my preferred method is in the beds.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:37.400]  The other great thing about the beds with a large phenohunt is when you're doing a phenohunt,
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.400]  inevitably you're going to have that monster plant that's really big,
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:44.400]  and you're going to have that little girl who's way over in the corner, and she's really small.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:52.400]  So if you wanted to automate the feeding on a phenohunt like that, it would be extremely difficult.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:56.400]  You'd have to have all these 1700 in this particular room where the creature came from.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.400]  You'd have to have 1700 nozzles with the drip irrigation that you're adjusting according to each plant.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:08.400]  It would have to be adjusted a little bit ongoing until you at least got them fine-tuned plant by plant each run.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:16.400]  But with the automation of the feeding that we did in this particular room with the beds,
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.400]  I just laid sprinklers on the inside of the beds.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:28.400]  I just laid PVC on the inside of the beds and sprinkler heads offset every three feet with that 180 pattern,
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:33.400]  and we shaved the legs way high so there was no danger of the water getting on the foliage.
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:36.400]  But it was a really simple way to feed that whole room.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:45.400]  It was a 35-light room with 1700 plants, and the feeding is 12 minutes. That's it.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:52.400]  You adjust the dosatrons. Your runoff takes as much time as your feeding in that situation.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.400]  You did a runoff, it takes five or 10, maybe 15 minutes.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.400]  You go adjust the dosatrons, turn on the dab pump, open the valves, and let it flow.
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:06.400]  The great thing about that is that if you have that little plant in the corner and that big monster a couple plants away,
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.400]  the monster is going to be aggressive.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:12.400]  She's going to take more of the nutrients in the water because she has the ability to.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:13.400]  She has roots everywhere.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:17.400]  And that little plant, the only danger you have there is if she's getting overfed,
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:23.400]  which again, if you're doing runoffs and stuff, it's not going to happen because that big plant right next to it as well
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:29.400]  is going to consume a lot of those nutrients because she needs more than her 4x4 patch that she got allotted.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:35.400]  And that little girl who's this big, she can get by a 4-inch pot, a 3-inch pot easily in the flower.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.400]  That's all she needs.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.400]  So it really helps to normalize the feeding.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.400]  Even if you're watering by hand with a hose and you're going through there,
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.400]  you don't really have to be over-concerned with watering any part of the bed more or less.
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.400]  It's pretty much an even dispersal.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:55.400]  It makes it so that you can take a thousand or two thousand or five thousand seed phenohut, put them in the beds,
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:05.400]  4-inch spacing, put irrigation that's automatic and not have to go hand feed 1,700 or 5,000 or 6,000 different girls individually.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:09.400]  That's what we really love to do is have individual feeding.
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:12.400]  But the beds, it lets nature take over.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.400]  The plants feed themselves individually according to what they want or need.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:24.400]  Yeah, given everything they want or need, it's already ready for them and they can just take it when they need it or want it.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.400]  Definitely.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:30.400]  And with the enzyme-rich bottled nutrients that I use, I mean, I'm getting as far as I can tell,
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.400]  a lot of the benefits that the living soil is getting.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.400]  And I don't have necessarily the complexity.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:41.400]  It's a very easy thing to do in a commercial environment.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.400]  And I use the soil over and over.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:50.400]  So it's kind of a hybrid of, you know, living soil and bottled nutrients.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.400]  It's really kind of in the middle.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.400]  It works really, really well for us.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.400]  Okay.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.400]  So you just chop at the base and leave the roots.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.400]  I like that.
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:58.400]  Great.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:05.400]  We chop at the base, come back two days later, pull up what comes out, smooth it out and plant most of the time right back in the same holes.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.400]  I got you.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.400]  Okay.
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.400]  That's sweet, man.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.400]  Well, your results show that what you're doing works.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.400]  Thank you, brother.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.400]  I appreciate that.
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:14.400]  100%.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:18.400]  I can't wait to give it a try myself, see if I can get a little something like you get out of them.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.400]  I'd love that.
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:20.400]  That'd be really cool.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.400]  I appreciate that.
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.400]  It's very kind of you to say.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.400]  I got a question for you about lighting.
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.400]  Well, actually, you know what?
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:28.400]  Let's go back.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.400]  A couple of friends are talking about pheno hunting.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:36.400]  You know, for, you know, on a small scale, someone can get a pack of 10 or 15.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:41.400]  Can you just give them a quick rundown of, you know, your process, what you do?
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:48.400]  And then I guess once you've selected out of there, do you then send off for testing every time?
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:58.400]  Or sometimes, obviously you do, but how important is like the actual paperwork test for like the backyard of the home grower?
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:03.400]  I think the paperwork is important to some people.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:08.400]  There's some people who never talk about paperwork.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.400]  They're fine paying whatever price it is.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:16.400]  Maybe it's the trust or my reputation or whatever it is.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.400]  They won't ask for anything.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:23.400]  And some people won't buy anything in terms of a clone or a genetic unless they see the paperwork.
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.400]  And they want a piece of flour.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:30.400]  You know, they want a piece of flour that I grew, take that, smoke it to be able to judge it, which is fine.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.400]  People are totally welcome to do their diligence.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:42.400]  When you're talking about 1,700 seed phenome or 5,000 seed phenome, it's not feasible financially to do a test on all those.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:47.400]  And you really don't need to because out of those, 95% of those plants are not going to be winners.
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:50.400]  Maybe even more, maybe 98% are not going to be winners.
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.400]  So you're not testing all of them.
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:58.400]  Generally what I do is just kind of touch on that and I'll back up a little bit.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:02.400]  I'll go through the whole phenome process the way I do it.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:09.400]  Generally what I do is I take the ones that I consider winners and I'll test them on my Purple Pro.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:15.400]  The Purple Pro will give me reasonably good results.
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:26.400]  And then after that, I'll take it and get a COI on it, you know, a COA, and get all the numbers and get it correct,
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:31.400]  especially for the higher ticket exclusive stuff like that.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:39.400]  Most people, honestly, I would say it's a very small percentage of people that actually will inquire for the testing and the certificate of analysis,
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:42.400]  whatever it is that they want to see, or a flower.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.400]  It's very, very rare.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:54.400]  Ninety-nine percent of the people grab my stuff because they've seen pictures or they've already kind of accepted that it's going to be fine.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.400]  So I really don't have as much of an, I think, uphill struggle with that on the sales end.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:09.400]  As I think somebody newer to the game, maybe with less of a name in the industry or less notoriety, I think it becomes more and more important.
[01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:19.400]  And if I was coming into the game now and trying to get into clone sales, commercial clone sales, I think I would be more likely,
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:25.400]  because nobody knew my name, I think I would be much more likely to try to beat guys like me by saying, look, I got all of these papers.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.400]  I got all this stuff.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.400]  Here it is, because you don't have your reputation to fall back on necessarily.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.400]  You don't have that.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.400]  That just kind of, there's little objection.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.400]  You know what I mean?
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:39.400]  When people hit me up for clones, they're already decided to buy them.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:43.400]  They just want to pick what it is and pick something in their budget that works with their attributes.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.400]  A lot of people just come to me and say, dealer's choice.
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:47.400]  Just give me whatever you want, bro.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:51.400]  Whatever you got is fire, so just give me whatever looks good right now.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.400]  So I think it's important.
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:57.400]  But I haven't found it to be extremely important.
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:08.400]  I like the numbers for myself, because I want to know that if I'm picking something and she's rating well on my scale, that part of that is that she has those numbers to match that.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:21.400]  I'm not going to rate something over 2,000 unless I have numbers either from my purple pro on several occasions, from me growing it and maybe another person growing it or something like that, or actually a third party testing it.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:29.400]  I don't honestly have a huge amount of faith with some legal testing facilities.
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:34.400]  I've unfortunately seen a lot of discrepancies in the numbers.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:38.400]  I've taken samples to the same sample off the same plant off the same big bud.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.400]  I've taken it to three different facilities.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:45.400]  I got three vastly different numbers as a result.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.400]  The state of Oklahoma requires that.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:49.400]  We get it tested and we supply that.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:56.400]  But I'm telling you right now, unfortunately, those numbers, in my opinion, in my experience, are not very reliable.
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.400]  They're becoming more reliable, but I don't put a ton of weight on those.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:06.400]  At the end of the day, I'm using my senses really to pick my wares.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.400]  I'm using my smell.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.400]  I'm using my taste.
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.400]  I'm using the look of the plant.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:19.400]  And there's just things that you get to know after growing for decades you really can't put in words easily.
[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:24.400]  I've been successfully picking plants early in veg.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.400]  I'll be like, that's the girl right there.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.400]  And sometimes I'm right, more often than not.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.400]  The odds are definitely in my favor that I'm right with those.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.400]  And you have a little bit to go on.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.400]  You have vegetative vigor.
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.400]  How did she pop out of her seed?
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.400]  How does she root?
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.400]  How fast does she grow?
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.400]  What's her branching like?
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:43.400]  What's her node spacing like?
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.400]  Is the stem rub loud?
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:49.400]  These are indicators, but they're not the end of the day.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.400]  I'm not picking winners and putting them on a menu in veg.
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:53.400]  They have to obviously be tested.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:21:03.400]  You start to develop a sixth sense almost to be able to see the winners early on and pick them and have an eye on them.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.400]  And I'll have my eye on those girls.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:11.400]  And again, maybe it goes back to the vibration of me saying, hey, this girl's going to be a winner.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.400]  I think she's going to be a winner.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.400]  Who knows?
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.400]  Because you're giving more energy to that girl.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.400]  I'm looking at her more often.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.400]  I'm admiring her more deeply.
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.400]  I'm gazing in her beauty more.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:25.400]  And those vibrations are most certainly affecting that plant.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:30.400]  Oh, yeah, that Chimera 4 right there is amazing on the top left in the gold in the background.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.400]  She's a stunner.
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:38.400]  This is the one that smells most like white truffle out of the Chimera testers that I had.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:41.400]  I had to turn down the brightness on this one.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.400]  She kept reflecting off funny.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.400]  I did a flash on and a flash off.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:49.400]  And in both of them, she was just extremely bright.
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:54.400]  When you go to flower, how many cuts do you keep, you know, before you even know who's the winner?
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:57.400]  Yeah. But you got your you're hoping.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.400]  Yeah, I want at least one.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:02.400]  OK, at least one rooted cut.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:14.400]  Gotcha. So I'm taking cuts, you know, two strongs before I plan on going in the flower or 14 days before I plan on going to the flower so that I know I have a rooted cut when I flip.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:18.400]  I have a rooted cut. If something happened to that cut and it didn't root, I got another chance.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.400]  That's right. Before flower.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:26.400]  And then because when they go into flower with four inch spacing, I'm only giving them two branches to work with.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.400]  That's all they have.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:34.400]  OK, so you're every time you're going to take that one topping and then you're going to go to flower on those four inch.
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.400]  Definitely. So. So.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.400]  So two songs before flower.
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:40.400]  I'm going to 14 days before flower.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:46.400]  I'm going to I'm going to leave two lowers and two uppers.
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:49.400]  Take the top is my main clone.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:52.400]  Those two lowers are my insurance policy.
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.400]  If they if that top roots, I'm good to go.
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:23:00.400]  I chop those on day one when I'm when I'm doing my heavy default.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:02.400]  If not, then boom. I got my backup plan.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.400]  I got two more.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:12.400]  Now I'll put both of them in there because I'm going to the flower now and in a raised bed, re-vegging really isn't a great option.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.400]  So it's it's now or never kind of thing.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:22.400]  I can take the plant out of the bed at harvest, cut the roots, put it in a pot and re-veg.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:28.400]  But as you know, that's more stress and the likelihood of having a successful re-veg is declining slightly.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:36.400]  Yeah. Have you looked at do you do bottomless pots at all on top of the four inch on the raised beds?
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:42.400]  I have done that both on purpose and by accident. Right. Yeah.
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:46.400]  I know what you mean. I've done it, too. Yeah. So I do that sometimes, too.
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:53.400]  Mostly when I'm going to plant something, a new veg plant in a bed and I put her in her fabric pot on top of there for a few days and I come back.
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.400]  Oh, right. Got to tear it out of there. Sorry to rip you, baby.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:02.400]  But that's root pruning. That is, you know, just as good as foliage pruning. It'll make you tough.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:07.400]  Yeah, definitely. Definitely. So kind of going back to the process of the phenol.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:14.400]  So, yeah, I mean, we plant the seed. We number them all, label them right away.
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.400]  And then we'll go is depending on the timing in our rooms.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:24.400]  We'd like to ideally go into flower when they're, you know, 12 or 18 inches tall on average.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:33.400]  And we can get one good clone rooted. Once a once they go in a flower, we strip them on day one down to basically sticks.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:39.400]  We take all families off. Pretty much pretty much everything comes off.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:46.400]  And they're basically left looking like Charlie Brown trees after after we've done with them.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:53.400]  And then we do that again on day 20. We grow them the same way we grow everything else.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:25:02.400]  And because we don't tiptoe around, you know, Sunday, like, oh, you know, keep it easy on your PPMs when you're testing something new.
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:13.400]  I don't do that because what if you do that and you keep your PPMs at 800 and then you go into your commercial room or somebody goes into a commercial room and they keep theirs at 1500 or 1200, whatever it is.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:23.400]  And she doesn't herm until after a thousand. And you have a plant that has intersex traits that you didn't find when you pheno hunted because you were tiptoeing around.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:29.400]  So I don't tiptoe around genetics. I don't purposely stress them with any kind of key or environmental inputs.
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:36.400]  But I don't tiptoe around. I treat them just like they're going to be treated in our commercial environments.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:47.400]  We put up our trellis, trellis frame, and we just leave them alone. We flush for 15 to 20 days, depending on what the runoff PPM is saying.
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:54.400]  We continue to flush until we get below like 100 or 50 PPM. Ideally, we want to be at zero.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:26:00.400]  That does happen most of the time. Sometimes we chop under 100, like 50, 60, 70 PPM.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:10.400]  Once again, that's benefiting me because I'm reusing that same medium in the next run. So I want that back to zero again anyways for the next run.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:28.400]  So we're flushing the soil, letting the plants uptake all the remaining nutrients, and we're going into the next run with the same reused cocoa and peat moss mix that has zero PPM and is going to be right around 6.0 pH again.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:36.400]  Now you had mentioned that you're using enzymes. Is that part of your secret sauce and how it seems like you're able to really push these genetics?
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:49.400]  Like Mr. Westport behind the scenes popping up your work there. Like you had mentioned, I feel like when someone is doing the feed scroll, there is certain genetics that really pop off from a variety of people that you had mentioned.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:27:12.400]  But I feel like once you see that on Instagram, that trichome production that it seems like all of your genetics have really just stands out. So is that kind of how you're pushing those genetics? Is your method and then is enzymes part of that key? Or can we talk more about using enzymes in the style that you're using?
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:37.400]  Yeah, Rasta, that's a really good question. Thank you. Yes and no. I mean, yes, enzymes are a major key. Though, I mean, to sum it all up, it's attention to detail, bro. That's, I mean, if you want to be a good grower, pay attention to every freaking thing. Everything. Know all your numbers and everything.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:59.400]  I'm doing runoffs constantly. I'm constantly looking at temperatures and humidity. I'm constantly looking at air movement and lights and distance from light. I'm looking at all this stuff, bro. That's people always ask me, you know, how do you grow it so fire? And I mean, I've always loved growing. So there might be something to be said for the green thumb.
[01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:28.400]  There might be something to said that some people maybe are just born better growers or have a better connection to plants. I don't know if that's accurate. I think it might be true. But I'm very conscious in the grow rooms. We're very deliberate with everything we do. We don't do things on accident. We don't do things just because without a reason. Everything we're doing in the grow rooms we're doing for a reason on purpose or we're just not doing it.
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:56.400]  We don't go through and squeeze buds. It destroys trichomes. We don't do that. It's tempting. I'd love to go pinch it and smell it. We do that to lowers, the lower buds, you know, where the little larvae or whatever down there that we'll leave a little bit of that stuff so we can smell it. We don't touch our nose. We, you know, it's like Mission Impossible walking through a grow room. You're dodging and making sure you don't scrape any flower ever. Not at all. More or less touching it.
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:09.400]  We don't touch our plants. Once day 20 and flower is done, we are not touching the plants. Because there's trichomes. I did a post on Instagram, one of my past Instagram accounts, where I took a plant.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:30.400]  And I took really close photos of the trichomes before being damaged. And then I took three separate places on the plant. And on one of them I scraped it with my beard. And I took a picture. And then another one I scraped it with my sleeve with some cotton fabric. I took a picture. And the other one I pinched it and rubbed it like you would smell it. And I took a picture and it was devastating.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:51.400]  The pictures of all three were devastating. It looked like a forest after a forest fire. Just a bunch of cracked off trichomes. And they start going like the trichome bases start turning black and dead. It's disgusting. Like that's what we're farming. We're not farming the vegetable materials. So for you to come and destroy those trichomes.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:30:12.400]  That's just one example. We just don't do that. When we're chopping the plant, we're taking, there's two or three people on a big plant, if it's a big plant in commercial, that are holding separate branches apart. You know, we're cutting the trellis from around the plant very gently as to not disturb trichomes.
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:38.400]  When we take it out and we hang it, it's all very gentle and very careful. You know, we just don't, we don't touch it. And then even when it's dry, if it's going to be cured flower, we're trimming it. You know, we're not holding the flower. We're not touching the flower. When people buy, I believe, cannabis, the flowers in a dispensary, which is very, very limited, very rarely happens. If they grab that, because we just don't drop that much.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:54.400]  That flower has not been touched by a human hand. Ever. It's not touched. You can take that flower, you can look at with your microscope or your lens, whatever, you're going to see all the trichomes to the point where they went in that jar were not damaged.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:31:23.400]  Now, if that jar was shaken around and for some of you to smell it, then that's going to damage those trichomes. That's why it smells more when you shake it around, because you're cracking the trichomes open, the terpenes come out, which is good to smell it. But like, you're going to break it up when you smoke it. So do it then. You know what I mean? Up until that point when you're grinding it or crushing it up to roll it or to put it in your, your, your bong or whatever, it should be untouched. Those trichomes should remain intact as much as possible.
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:39.400]  So this is one example of some details that we focus on. We have shower only entries in our facilities. There's a couple new ones that we don't, but we sold for our vehicle in the garage, shower and get right in the vehicle and go right to the room.
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:32:02.400]  So there's just these details that we don't play. We don't play just any music in our rooms. If, if we're playing music, it's, you know, we're looking for 432 megahertz or reggae music or classical music.
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:18.400]  And they hooked up to the Bluetooth and they're playing. I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. Stop. No, stop. No, stop. Can't play that in here. Cut it. Cut it. Go to the reggae channel.
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.080]  new team members will come in,
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:21.680]  and I'll step out of the room for a second,
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:23.000]  I'll come back, and they hooked up to
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.200]  Bluetooth and they're playing something.
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:27.520]  I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, stop, no, stop, no, stop.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:29.000]  Can't play that in here.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.640]  Cut it, cut it, go to the reggae channel.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:34.280]  Is that Dennis Brown or what?
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:39.840]  Yeah. Well, I named my rooms after reggae artists.
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:42.280]  We actually had a room in Vegas named Dennis.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:43.200]  Nice.
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:47.720]  Yeah. All of our rooms are named after reggae artists that we're keeping separate.
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:52.480]  To answer the question, how is it so trichrome rich and how is it so fire?
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:55.960]  That's it. We pay attention to every single little detail,
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:57.800]  because every single detail matters,
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:00.840]  and that finished product is an expression of the work you've done.
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:03.600]  You can't hide. You can't hide.
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:05.080]  You show that flower,
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.960]  you can't say, look, I'm a bomb grower.
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:09.480]  If that's not bomb, then I'm sorry, bro.
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:12.000]  You're pretty good. Let's do better.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:15.840]  Because I once grew product like that too, and then I got better.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.880]  So you can do it, but you're just not there yet.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.240]  So flower doesn't lie.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.480]  The Rosen Press doesn't lie.
[01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:23.480]  The ice water hash doesn't lie.
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:26.240]  These things, the product speaks for itself.
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:30.160]  So we want to make sure that all the inputs that are going into that
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:34.080]  are going to create the best possible product that you can imagine.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:36.160]  And we're always one-upping ourselves.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:40.440]  So even the stuff we've done today that we feel is innovative,
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:44.320]  we're going to step on that and get higher and higher every time we go.
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:47.200]  Every day we're learning more about this plant
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:50.040]  and how to better treat her in different environments,
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:52.400]  in different rooms and how to do all this fun stuff.
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:54.360]  So what do you think of?
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.720]  What do you think about lighting belief?
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:58.480]  Like, what do you think?
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:01.480]  How important are different types of lighting?
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:02.880]  Have you run side by side?
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:06.320]  The LED versus old school, you know, old school tech and, you know,
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:08.800]  any differences? What are you feeling?
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:10.400]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:13.000]  We've run through a lot of lights, you know, coming from the old school,
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:17.040]  single-ended, you know, single-ended HPS and metal halide,
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:20.640]  whereas, you know, big old air-cooled lights,
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:24.160]  the Raptors, I think they were, yeah, Raptors.
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:27.760]  We used to use those and we did really well with them.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.440]  And we were getting our two pounds of light off those
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:32.160]  with our better strains, you know, 10 years ago.
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:38.080]  Now I pretty much I use four types of light.
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:41.760]  I use lux, double-ended.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.240]  I guess I use five.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:47.240]  I use the lux, double-ended HPS 1000 watts.
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:50.240]  I use the lux 630 CMHs.
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:54.240]  I use the lux clone strips.
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:57.240]  I use the lux 645 LED pros.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.240]  And I use these vivid grow.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:07.040]  They're called clone strips, but they're really too aggressive for clones in domes.
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:11.520]  I use those with a greater distance away from the plant.
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:15.520]  Two or three days after they come out of the dome,
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.360]  because they're pretty intense.
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:19.880]  It's like a mild veg light, but really intense for a young clone.
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:24.880]  And then I did I've got I've got a couple of test rooms.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.080]  We tested several different LEDs.
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:31.080]  The guys from Mars LED sent me a light, which was, you know, something like
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.040]  a lot of people tell me, oh, don't waste your time with Mars and stuff.
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.240]  They're inferior.
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:36.840]  That's really why I tested the light.
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.280]  I wanted to see for myself.
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:43.480]  And while the weight, the harvest weight was lower than other LEDs
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:45.960]  that were similar in wattage,
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:49.400]  the quality was really, really good.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:54.200]  It was probably within five percent of of what I experienced with the lux LEDs.
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:57.920]  I'm currently testing a black dog LED that the guys over there
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:04.560]  gave me to test, which I'm extremely happy with so far.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:07.120]  We'll be going into flower with that real soon.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.440]  But we've used it. It's a very intense flower.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:13.120]  We use it as a veg light and we're very happy that in veg as a ten foot
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:15.800]  by ten foot pattern and the flower has a six foot pattern,
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:18.240]  which is really useful in certain areas.
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:24.960]  So with lighting, I really, really am in love with the Lux LED 645 pros for flowering.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:29.480]  I love the fact that you don't have to have 17 foot high ceilings.
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:32.640]  You can't be really close to the lights.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.960]  You're still getting a lot of weight.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:39.600]  I find a little more color in some of the strains with the Lux.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.720]  I have them side by sides with the Lux HPS 1000
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:47.760]  double ended and the Lux 645
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:52.560]  LED. And I mean,
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:56.600]  as you would imagine with the HPS,
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:59.440]  you're gaining a little bit of bulk,
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.920]  but you're losing a little bit of the trichomes.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.560]  Still insanely gas
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:10.400]  with the LED on the same
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.840]  little bit less weight,
[01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:20.000]  little bit more trichomes and a slightly different profile
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.680]  leaning on the white truffle, at least a little more towards the garlicky
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:29.000]  gassiness and a little bit away from the peanut butter and the earth.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.760]  So I have done side by sides.
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:35.160]  I really like the 645 Lux LED pros right now.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:38.720]  Again, they don't use much power, especially at 240.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.600]  They run on two or three amps,
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:46.160]  which is great if your amps are limited, which is the case of most growers
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.120]  because we're always trying to push it and grow as much as we can in any given space.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:52.160]  That is low. Yeah.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.440]  The heat. I mean, if you're on 80 percent, you can hold the light
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.800]  right up against the diodes and it's going to be a little warm,
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:01.480]  but it's not hot on 100 percent.
[01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:03.200]  You really can't keep your hand there,
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:05.320]  but you can't even think about doing anything like that with that
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:07.880]  with the double ended or even the single.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:10.280]  So the heat is really a big factor.
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.560]  I really I really like those lights.
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:17.920]  And since I grow more for trichomes than for size,
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:22.240]  you know, the adage is, you know, if you want to grow size and flower,
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:26.200]  you keep your growing a little warmer, more or less at 77, 78.
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:29.400]  And then if you want to grow more trichomes and, you know,
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.320]  you want to have a little bit more higher quality,
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:34.120]  but you're willing to sacrifice some of the size,
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:36.480]  you know, keep it a little cooler.
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:39.560]  And that does prove true with my rooms.
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:41.840]  So we keep it pretty cool.
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:45.440]  We like to be around 77, 78 for the first 20 days.
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:51.320]  And then on day 21 is when I cut it down like 75 for about seven to 10 days.
[01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:53.600]  And then I just go right down to 72, 73.
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:57.080]  And I stay there until the end.
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:03.360]  Last few days, we go down to 65 with lights on and 58 lights off.
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:06.520]  If I want more purple, I might go lower.
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:08.440]  I might go 55 for the last couple of days.
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:14.520]  I do dark photo periods for the last two days or three days before I harvest.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:18.560]  I like it because it kills a lot of additional chlorophyll
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:24.480]  that's responsible for a lot of the grassy tones in cannabis once it's dried.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:29.600]  So we eliminate all the potential for that grassy kind of thing going on.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:36.360]  We dry really well at 60 percent at 65 degrees for 16 days,
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:38.960]  which which will prevent a lot of that.
[01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:43.080]  But just as an extra additional insurance policy, we like to go dark for two or three days,
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:46.960]  58 to 62 degrees before we harvest.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:51.240]  I think that definitely tells the plant that it's over with.
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:56.360]  It's time to give every last bit of love you have to these buds,
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:01.120]  you know, and their desire to to procreate.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:02.080]  That's what they do.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:05.360]  That's why the girls keep keep flowering and flowering and flowering
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.600]  is because they want to they want to procreate.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:12.080]  So if you make it in, if you make it very obvious that it's cold
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:16.560]  and it's dark and it's winter in the end, they'll give the last spurt
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:19.360]  of everything they have, all the nutrients and the sap they have in there
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.480]  and their stems and branches will go up into those buds.
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:25.120]  And it kills the chlorophyll at the same time.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.160]  So we really like going dark.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:31.280]  But yeah, that's basically the way we grow, the way we phenol hunt at the end.
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:37.920]  Usually, usually around day 45 to day 55, I'm pre selecting winners.
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:42.400]  So I'm saying like, based on what I've seen, this is a winner.
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:47.920]  Ninety five percent of the time we're right, right.
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:50.400]  There's very few times we're at day 50 or 55.
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.840]  I'm calling that a winner.
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.920]  And she she turns out not being a winner.
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:57.040]  Usually when that happens, it's because the smoke test failed.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.400]  Maybe she didn't taste like she smelled.
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.520]  Maybe she didn't taste at all.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:04.320]  Maybe she was harsh when the other ones weren't.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:07.040]  Maybe she wasn't strong.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:09.840]  These would be reasons that she would be eliminated at the end,
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:12.160]  even though she may look insanely fire.
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:15.520]  She may even smell insanely fire.
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:20.840]  I steer away from selecting plants that don't taste like they smell.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:24.960]  I find it to be a disappointment, even if it still tastes good, but different.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:29.080]  I find that people get disappointed because the expectation when you're smelling it,
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:32.400]  you're smelling something that's like tangy and it smells all tangerine
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:35.160]  and you smoke it and it doesn't taste like tangerines.
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:38.480]  It's kind of a letdown because you are so excited
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:40.880]  and so looking forward to that tangerine in your mouth.
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:44.040]  And all you got is a freaking campfire, you know.
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:47.280]  So we select plants.
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:51.800]  That's one of the things we select for is plants that taste the way they smell.
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:55.680]  We want stuff that is kind of, you know, you're taking home from the dispensary.
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:57.600]  You're not going to be disappointed
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:00.280]  whether we grew it or somebody else grew it.
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:05.120]  And when you say I'm sorry, Brian, just to go back to Tremont and trichomes,
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:07.920]  you say, obviously not touched by human hands.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:08.440]  I get that.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:12.960]  So you guys just for the sake of what you do, definitely hand trim everything
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:16.000]  100%. Absolutely. Yes.
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:19.520]  Yeah. All right. Much respect for that. Thank you, bro.
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:23.640]  It's challenging, but I have a daughter who is amazing at trimming.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:29.560]  And when trim time comes, she hires and tells me this is the standard.
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:32.560]  If I see you touch it, you know, you're not going to get many warnings
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.480]  because we went months not touching it.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:38.440]  You're going to touch it for a couple of minutes.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:40.120]  Yeah, that'd be pretty hot.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:42.560]  They don't don't get belief pissed off in there now.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.640]  Don't it's like, would you go to the Mona Lisa and like put a mustache on?
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:47.760]  Right. Exactly.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:49.920]  Don't do that. One hundred. I feel you.
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:51.520]  Don't do that.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:54.880]  But I at the same time, I'm not a hater of trim machines.
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:57.680]  I'm not going to put my stuff through a trim.
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:00.920]  No. But if I grew out now, not even then.
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:05.920]  And I just say if I grew outdoors and it was windy and stormy and even then,
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:08.840]  like, why? Because you already have limited trichomes.
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:11.200]  Why? Why push it? Exactly.
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:13.800]  I was just trimming mine before we got on, brother.
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:15.760]  I know what you mean. Yeah.
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:18.600]  Well, Mark, I think there is situations where a trim trim
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:21.160]  machine is the right choice.
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:24.160]  But I think it's a very, very small part of the market.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.720]  That's just my personal opinion.
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:32.600]  I want to do a you dropped a basically like I felt like a couple paragraphs
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:36.520]  of bars there where you're really giving details of the way that you finish
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:39.600]  things out, and I just wanted to pay respects for that, man.
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:43.160]  I hope maybe we could even timestamp that, Chad, because I think there's.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:45.480]  And again, everybody's going to do it their way.
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:49.920]  You know, even in for most of my time, commercial farming,
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:53.160]  even if room one and room two is basically in that same area,
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.240]  it always seemed like there were different nuances
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:58.400]  in room one compared to room two or vice versa.
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:00.800]  And it just seemed like things were always changing and evolving.
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.840]  But for you to be able to dial in and at least give people a blueprint
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:07.600]  where they can at least have a, you know, a starting point.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.680]  Some people sometimes people are really vague, man.
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.680]  And you were sitting there giving the real playbook.
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:15.880]  And that's why I just wanted to kind of give you kudos to that,
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:18.720]  because sometimes when we ask questions, people answer them.
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:21.800]  And then there's other times when we ask questions and people really answer them.
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:23.600]  And I felt like you really answered that, man.
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:25.560]  So hopefully we can timestamp that.
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:27.200]  Yeah, I appreciate that.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.400]  Because it takes a long time to get to your level, man.
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:32.200]  You know, I mean, there's a lot of people, especially watching our show
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:35.320]  that are growing intense or growing in their basement that would love to be,
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:38.200]  you know, the showtime grower.
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:40.920]  But it takes a long time to get there.
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:44.480]  And then once you're there, there's so many new like nuances
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:47.360]  that I feel like you might not understand unless you've taken the time
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:52.680]  to prepare yourself for a long time that those nuances were glaring,
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:55.440]  especially when Colorado first really opened up
[01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:58.920]  just of where I felt like a lot of us,
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:02.560]  even a lot of people that we looked up to, their skill sets were there.
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:04.800]  And then when you multiplied it, if they did have
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.400]  weaknesses or something like that, it was amplified.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.360]  And back to what you were saying about the music, I feel that way, too, man.
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:15.680]  When, you know, kudos to you to have the balls to say that,
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:19.480]  because I feel like a lot of people poo poo that stuff like it's just nonsense.
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:24.560]  But I've personally seen as well and not even necessarily music,
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:28.640]  but when like the team is vibing together and there's a bunch of egos going around,
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:30.840]  it seems like the plants just kind of fall over.
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:34.040]  Or if you really are hitting them with,
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:36.920]  you know, sometimes music that I'll admit that I even enjoy.
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:41.080]  But if it is very negative constantly while you're in there and working,
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:46.480]  I feel like that's just something that I don't think a lot of even show
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:50.040]  cannabis shows or even cannabis farmers take the time to to really acknowledge.
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:51.800]  And again, kudos to the water.
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:54.200]  That's something that I've been researching these last few weeks,
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:57.840]  probably even going into months now of just understanding,
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:00.160]  you know, really what that takes.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:04.680]  And as far as I know, in my research, human beings are about 72 percent water.
[01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:07.160]  So as you guys are looking at that stuff, I mean, you know,
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:08.640]  your thoughts and all that stuff.
[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:11.560]  I mean, all that stuff that I feel like a lot of people kind of just dismiss
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:13.560]  and think is bullshit.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:17.400]  You know, here's another example where I feel like you can see
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:22.200]  with real science behind it what happens, especially when you speak.
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:26.080]  I think he was also speaking to the water from when I when I was researching that
[01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:30.440]  and what was you know, he was basically like putting that energy,
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.720]  putting those vibes into that water.
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.800]  And then you guys obviously can see what happens.
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:40.040]  So very interesting to to kind of I almost feel like we like tiptoed over that.
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:44.400]  And that was a huge rabbit hole for me when I was really trying to understand
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:47.120]  what it would take to get to a level that you're at, man.
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:50.440]  And I feel like, yeah, again, you're showing the real playbook.
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.560]  So we appreciate it.
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:55.080]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:59.600]  You know, when I was when I was started, when I started growing, it was high times
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:03.120]  and like Ed Rosenthal and like that was it.
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.520]  And that wasn't available at the library.
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.760]  There was not Internet.
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:10.920]  I couldn't just go on the Internet and say, how do I what's wrong with my plant?
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:13.080]  You know, type in stuff and get answers.
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.400]  So I think that's really a benefit
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:20.400]  because it caused me to learn directly through trial and error.
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:23.440]  I don't have any questions about what I know about the cannabis plant.
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:27.720]  If I learned something from the Internet because another guy said it was true
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:33.120]  and it worked, you still it's not it's not as solid of a foundation
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:36.520]  as when you do it yourself and fail and learn that way.
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:42.600]  So I think that lesson, the latter is preferable because it doesn't go away.
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:46.360]  That pain of killing a plant will stick with you.
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:51.440]  Versus somebody saying, you know, make sure you do this or you might kill a plant
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:52.800]  that doesn't really stick with you.
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.360]  It doesn't mean anything until it happens.
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.400]  But when you come and you see you kill the plant,
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:01.560]  that's a life form that depended on you that probably wouldn't be there
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:02.560]  if it wasn't for you.
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:04.800]  So when you bring it, you take full responsibility.
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:07.760]  That plant can't get up and go drink some water like you can.
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:09.720]  It's completely dependent on you.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:11.760]  And you are now a caregiver.
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:13.800]  So it's your responsibility.
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:16.400]  And when you fail, you fail.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:18.720]  And there's nothing that can put it back together.
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:21.640]  When that plant is dead, you can't do anything about it.
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:22.960]  It's gone.
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:27.080]  So, you know, we want to be proactive instead of reactive.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:30.680]  We want to look ahead and see things that we can avoid as pitfalls,
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:34.240]  as opposed to just going about our day and hoping everything works out
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:37.320]  and then finding those pitfalls and then have to react to them.
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:41.800]  When you're reacting, you know, you're you're you're stressed out.
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:43.960]  You're trying to grab clutch for straw and stuff
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:46.840]  instead of being on that solid foundation and being, well, I got this.
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:48.720]  It's no problem. I know what to do now.
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:51.240]  So, yeah, the trial and error is big, bro.
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:53.640]  And I'm happy to pass on any information.
[01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.120]  The only thing I don't give is my recipe because I've sold my exact nutrient
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:01.520]  recipe to some commercial facilities and I had them sign an NDA,
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:02.840]  which I also, of course, signed.
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:05.240]  So that's the only thing that I can't really give out.
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:09.400]  But anything else, people hit my DM and ask me questions all the time, bro.
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:12.840]  It's, you know, hours a day
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:15.800]  that we spend in that DM, but it's a commitment I made.
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.360]  I'm not going to do it.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:18.560]  I'm not going to not answer those.
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:19.800]  I feel that.
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:23.600]  I have a responsibility to respond to the people that are lifting me up
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:26.080]  on their shoulders because I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:28.600]  I would just be some guy growing a bunch of cannabis
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:31.080]  and trying to show his family that nobody would care.
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:33.520]  But they don't smoke. They don't fucking care.
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:34.440]  You know what I mean?
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.680]  Like, yeah, it's a pretty flower. Cool.
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:40.600]  But, you know, with with these connoisseurs and the people who are efficient,
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:45.280]  all those like yourselves and all the people, you know, on the live right now
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.200]  or listening in the replays, these are people that,
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:50.480]  you know, these people want to buy, but they might people are here.
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:52.760]  So I want to make sure they're taken care of.
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:55.680]  The audience actually is asking where they can get your seats.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:58.480]  Who's repping your seeds? Is that on a seed bank?
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:03.120]  So, yeah, the best place to get my seeds is to email me right now.
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:05.760]  We're kind of acting like as a seed bank and trying to figure out
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:09.680]  if we want to actually move forward and get a website and do a seed bank thing
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  where we sell our stuff and other people's stuff,
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.840]  or if we just want to do the traditional route and send it off to seed banks.
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:18.920]  So right now, with the limited stock we have, the email is the best place.
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:21.680]  So that's belief cannabis at Gmail dot com.
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:25.600]  So just like up here, the belief cannabis and a Gmail dot com.
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:26.560]  Not that shake part.
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.800]  Yeah. Belief cannabis at Gmail dot com.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:34.280]  You can hit us up there and you can get an inventory of what we have.
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:35.720]  We have full menus.
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:37.840]  We post the menus sometimes.
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:39.680]  Thank you, Esther. Perfect.
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:42.720]  We post the menu sometimes on Instagram or other social media outlets,
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:44.160]  but that's kind of tricky sometimes.
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:46.640]  So that's the best place to hit us up.
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:49.160]  We have we do have no gas.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.160]  The chimera was sold out.
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:53.040]  The lava girl was sold out.
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:55.360]  We do have Kool-Aid man.
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:57.880]  Kool-Aid man is the watermelon mimosa.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:01.120]  My my phenom number ten times the creature.
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:04.680]  That's a collab with lit farms.
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:06.560]  God is my divinity.
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:10.080]  Thirty five bred by in-house times the creature.
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:12.400]  That's a collab with in-house genetics,
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:16.280]  which we still have a very limited number of those packs left.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.440]  We do have very, very few Nova gas.
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:23.040]  We have anything else.
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:24.640]  I think that's it.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:27.400]  We have pomplamoose pomplamoose or red seeds.
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:29.480]  This is a collab with Third Coast.
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:33.120]  He did the breeding work on these.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:36.800]  We just tested them and we got a bunch of packs of those.
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:38.520]  Those are available as well.
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:42.920]  We're dropping the second wave of the creature in about 20 days.
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:48.280]  And now be like the creature breath, which is jelly breath
[01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:50.800]  times the creature and their in-house collab
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:54.240]  and a bunch of others.
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:59.360]  We do Bonnie, which is mafia funeral from compound genetics.
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:01.560]  We cross out the creature.
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:05.040]  I did my cut of the ice cream cake times the creature.
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:07.120]  That's called ice cream cake.
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:12.120]  There's a there's a few more, but we can send them to anybody who wants them.
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:14.960]  And then the third wave of the creature will be on about 40 days.
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:19.080]  I'm doing a reversal on the truffle on number one.
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:22.800]  So as ones of those available in about three months,
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:25.640]  doing the second round of chimera,
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:30.520]  which is why truffle times the creature, which is my favorite cross
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:33.800]  of those that I've tested so far from the creature line.
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:35.320]  Absolutely crazy.
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:38.600]  I honestly wasn't even going to give 10 packs because you don't need 10.
[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:42.640]  Like you just don't need 10 fem seeds to find what you want there.
[01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:45.920]  You'll find these people that the limited people that got the packs
[01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:48.360]  that we dropped already of the chimera.
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:49.640]  They have 10 seeds.
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:52.240]  They're going to find five or more winners.
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:54.520]  I'm extremely confident about that.
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:55.960]  Everyone I planted was a winner.
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:53:00.240]  Every single chimera seed I planted was where I planted 17 more just to test that
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:02.680]  because like there's no way everyone is a prick.
[01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:04.800]  They're absolutely insane.
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:06.440]  Absolutely. And they smell like.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.200]  Number two, there's a couple of females that smell like
[01:53:11.480 --> 01:53:16.440]  like butterscotch, like salted caramel and earthy gas.
[01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:19.600]  And there's one that smells a lot like white truffle
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:21.720]  with just a little bit of tropical sweetness.
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:24.200]  And then there's another.
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.440]  Oh, my gosh, bro. Stop.
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:29.360]  Stop. I'm in love with this girl.
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:32.280]  This is the butterscotch salted caramel.
[01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:37.560]  Funky, stinky, loud, big producing.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.520]  Just a monster of a plant.
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:42.680]  How many days?
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:45.120]  These were harvested at 75. OK.
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:49.720]  Yeah, but you can see she started to to foxtail out a little bit.
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:52.800]  This is one of the more foxtail rich buds that we had.
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:54.520]  She's crazy, bro.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:56.080]  I'm so in love with this plant.
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:58.320]  This is exactly what I wanted from this cross.
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:00.600]  This is exactly what I was hoping for.
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:04.600]  Better. The crosses on this one turned out better than I thought they would.
[01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:05.760]  It's amazing.
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:07.400]  It looks like the creature.
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:09.920]  But now it's it tightened up. Right.
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:13.280]  But still has kind of the all the surface area.
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:15.760]  She does. She's got. Yeah, she's.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.040]  And and truffle does that, too.
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:21.160]  White truffle does that like on the top of most like you'll have the first
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:23.600]  two or three buds and there'll be like this little gap
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:26.040]  and then there'll be like two or three more buds.
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:28.480]  She does that as like part of her plantality.
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:31.280]  She she expresses this interesting thing.
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:33.080]  So you're seeing that there, too.
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:34.080]  This is white truffle.
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:38.360]  This was the one I tested under the six forty five LED from Lux.
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:42.840]  Yeah, go try a little less bulk.
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:46.760]  This is it. This was harvested a day 73 and this was right before the harvest.
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:48.920]  This was day 72.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.240]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:52.520]  She was grown in a half gallon pot.
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:56.960]  Wow. Now, which one of these are for people that are going to probably
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:54:59.680]  start getting your genetics that would want to, you know,
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:02.000]  which ones dump in your opinion?
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  White white truffle does 4% creature is is very high.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.480]  I don't have exact numbers, but I know she's over five and a half
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:15.880]  ice cream cake dumps five percent plus the divine banana dumps
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:19.960]  the mafia funeral dumps.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.640]  Let's talk about that one right there.
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:23.040]  It's a mafia funeral.
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:25.560]  I've had a couple of people talking to me about that one.
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:27.160]  That ice cream cake right there.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:29.080]  Yeah, she dumps.
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:31.440]  She smells like lemon cake batter and gasoline.
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:33.560]  She's insane.
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:36.680]  Mm hmm. Oh, she likes it cold.
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:38.400]  She won't do this unless it's cold.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.280]  She won't have these big Alex's unless it's 72 degrees.
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.240]  And she doesn't she wants it straight from day 20.
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:48.440]  If you don't do that, she will not do this blood structure.
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:50.240]  It's freaking crazy.
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:53.520]  If you go warm at all, she'll look like a Christmas tree, but like the same triangle
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:55.640]  thing. Wow.
[01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:59.560]  Yeah, this was the cut that was gifted to me from heavily connected.
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:01.160]  I love her.
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.320]  I was fire. That's the ice cream cake.
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:05.840]  This is on my low. Yeah, this is the ice cream cake.
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:08.680]  She's on the lowest price point of my menu.
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:12.200]  I did that because I did not feel Hunter.
[01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.800]  So the the expenses and all that stuff that go into me, you know,
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:18.960]  and you weren't involved in this cut and it was gifted to me.
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:21.240]  So I wanted to kind of show the love.
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:23.240]  But she she's insane.
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:25.640]  Absolutely insane.
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:27.560]  And she finishes on time.
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:29.520]  She's well branched. She's strong.
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:31.440]  She does everything I want. She's an amazing one.
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:34.000]  Very nice.
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:37.280]  There was one, the mafia.
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:40.560]  That was another one that a bunch of people have been kind of talking about.
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:42.520]  Can you just briefly mention that?
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:44.280]  Can we kind of break that one down?
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:46.160]  Mafia funeral is real funky.
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.840]  She's got this.
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.720]  It's not like gym socks.
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:53.520]  It's like funky, sour, B.O.
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:55.200]  times like.
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:57.840]  Apricot jam.
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:03.040]  Mm. Really interesting, like a sour, funky, jammy.
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:07.120]  She's got something else going on, too.
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.680]  It's really hard to put into words.
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:10.680]  She's very unique.
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:15.000]  She just won second place in the People's Choice Cannabis Cup,
[01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:17.320]  the High Times Cannabis Cup out here in Tulsa.
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:19.560]  It wasn't grown by me.
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:23.480]  It was grown by a brother in a mine who got some clones for his commercial facility.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.560]  But yeah, she won the Cannabis Cup because she's just so unique.
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:32.120]  She's she's a little if any drawback, she's a little leafy.
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:36.040]  So trimming or maybe a little more laborious than some people want.
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:38.040]  But other than that, she's a perfect plant.
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:40.400]  She stays squat. She doesn't go real tall.
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:45.480]  She's a nice shrug with 45 degree angles, you know, on her on her branching.
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:50.680]  But really strong, really kind of airy and kind of opens up herself.
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:55.480]  And she just has these super dense, solid, fat, heavy buds
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:58.760]  that just reek and reek.
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:02.200]  And she finished she finishes like day 63.
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:04.280]  So she doesn't take too long.
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:06.440]  You could probably drop her day 60 if you really wanted to.
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:07.960]  Well, we did a drop.
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:10.480]  A lot of people chose the Mafia Funeral No.
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:13.480]  6, which is a phenotype kept as their favorite.
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:16.920]  And that was against the white truffle, against the Gucci fruit,
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:20.360]  against the Hawaiian punch and smothers. Wow.
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:24.720]  Yeah. You got some big fanboys, if you will, on those genetics, man.
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:26.480]  I think people are really rocking that.
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:28.600]  And I, I personally never even heard of it, man.
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:34.440]  So hats off to you just having and having quite the catalog portfolio.
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:36.520]  You know, there's so much stuff.
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:39.240]  I'm glad that we can learn more about it today.
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:41.160]  Definitely. Yeah, man.
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:43.320]  All love, all love.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:47.600]  So I feel like some of the old heads, when I was kind of getting into this
[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:51.320]  and picking genetics, going if you were lucky enough to go through somebody's
[01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:54.840]  grow, it was the stem rod like you had mentioned.
[01:58:54.840 --> 01:58:56.960]  Do you feel like that is tried and true?
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:01.040]  And then some of the older heads also taught me to take a fan leaf off
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:02.520]  and put that in your mouth.
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:04.920]  And if you had like a sweet taste to it,
[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:08.680]  you knew that that was we're going to be really high end genetics.
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:09.920]  Is there any truth to that?
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:14.920]  Or is that just kind of some of those old lore legend stuff that people would pass on?
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:17.080]  That's a phenomenal question, Rasta.
[01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:19.760]  Yeah, man. I think I think it helps.
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:21.600]  I don't think it's tried and true.
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:25.400]  I think it can help indicate that you're looking at somebody
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:28.760]  who's more likely to be a winner. The stem rod.
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:33.920]  There's a plant, I'm not going to mention her name, she's not really on my menu.
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:35.880]  She's not on my menu anymore, actually.
[01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:38.160]  And the reason she came off
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:43.200]  is because in veg, she is the stinkiest plant you'll smell.
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:45.080]  Like just go near her.
[01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:47.320]  Don't even touch her. And she stinks.
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:51.320]  If you move her, she stinks up like, you know, a four foot,
[01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:53.400]  four cubic foot area.
[01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:55.720]  If you rub her stem, she'll stink up the room.
[01:59:56.520 --> 02:00:00.040]  And when she's done as a flower, she has no turns.
[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:04.520]  None. So there are exceptions to the rule.
[02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:06.720]  And I think they're they're normal.
[02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:09.480]  It does happen on the stem rod that you're going to get somebody
[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:13.640]  who's super stinky in veg or even an early flower.
[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:17.680]  But then it doesn't translate to that super loud flower.
[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:20.000]  I think it's more likely.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.000]  I think if you smell that loud stem, that's going to indicate she's more likely.
[02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.520]  So I'm going to keep a closer eye on that girl for sure.
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:32.520]  But it's not definitive
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:35.000]  in my opinion.
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:37.800]  The fan leaf, I've heard this before.
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:42.800]  I personally haven't tasted enough families to really tell you whether it's true or not.
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:45.480]  I would think that it would be true,
[02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:49.320]  because if you're tasting the family and you're tasting sweetness, that's the bricks.
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:53.160]  And the bricks is the plant producing sugars
[02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:57.000]  from the nutrients in the air and the sunlight and so forth.
[02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:01.600]  So if if it's producing a sweeter level, it has more bricks.
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:06.680]  I would think that that would more more likely lend itself to high quality genetics.
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:09.800]  I know that in wine production and grapes
[02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:14.000]  for wine production, they're measuring the bricks, right?
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:15.680]  They're taking it out before harvest.
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:18.200]  They got this little bricks meter, take a little piece of glass
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:21.520]  that they break open a grape and they rub it on there.
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:24.280]  And it can tell them the bricks level, the sweetness of it
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:26.840]  to indicate when it's ready to harvest.
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:28.840]  So I think that sweeter
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:36.640]  petiole or families would indicate again, but not define a winner.
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:41.800]  Appreciate you on that, man.
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:43.160]  Yeah, I've read.
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:48.360]  Yeah, you got more questions, Margo, because I got a bunch over here, man.
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:49.680]  Yeah. Keep on rolling, Brian.
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:50.960]  I'll jump in there.
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:51.320]  All right.
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:55.440]  So I feel like a lot of people, especially if they want to make the transition
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:01.000]  from a casual farmer, maybe just in hopes to get to a commercial farmer,
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:03.560]  seems like they need to understand certain things.
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:06.360]  One of them for a style needs to be the dosatrons.
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:09.160]  And I know that a lot of people have failed with those.
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:13.560]  So are there any like gold nuggets that you could could offer with understanding
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:14.960]  that on our show?
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:17.200]  We talk a lot about the blue mats, but I don't feel like,
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:20.560]  especially if they're newer farmers, they might not even know what a dosatron is.
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:24.000]  So maybe we could kind of explain that on a deeper level.
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:26.320]  Sure, absolutely, Rasta.
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:27.800]  Yeah, another great question.
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:29.560]  You guys are fucking awesome.
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:33.240]  So the dosatron is a fertigation injector.
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:37.600]  So it basically is meant to be a hands off way of fertilizing your crop
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:43.920]  with liquid or liquid soluble water, soluble nutrients.
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:46.920]  So you could use salt and stuff like that because you mix them with the water.
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:49.040]  You could use bottled liquid nutrients.
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:53.440]  You can use your own fermented teas or whatever else you're going to use.
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:54.360]  That's liquid.
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:59.280]  The dosatron basically you'll have your your feed.
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:02.000]  You'll have a reservoir of RO water
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:04.760]  or whatever water you're using.
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:06.680]  I recommend RO.
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:09.120]  And then basically you have
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:12.800]  some kind of pump water pump that's going to pump the water.
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:17.120]  And the dosatron automatically injects the water
[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:21.200]  going through a series of PVC or pipes
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:22.960]  as shown here.
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:25.160]  The big blue part is the injector.
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:28.240]  The bottom you can see there's a little bit of a reservoir.
[02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:30.640]  It appears to be water in this illustration.
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:32.560]  That would represent your nutrient mix.
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:35.320]  So this injector is sucking up
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:39.240]  through the through the power of water pressure.
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:40.320]  It's not electronic.
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:43.000]  There's no electronics involved on the dosatron injectors.
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:47.000]  It's working through water pressure from the pump.
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:50.600]  The pump is pushing or sucking the water through the dosatron.
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:53.600]  In my case, we're pumping the water through the dosatron.
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:57.240]  And as the water flows through, it just goes.
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:59.760]  There's a little spring inside that goes up and down.
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.840]  And every time it goes down, it sucks up a certain set
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:05.760]  amount of nutrients and it goes up and injects it into the line.
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:08.760]  So you've got this RO water that's going through the line
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.720]  and it's going to run into usually multiple injectors.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.600]  So it's going to run into like one for your.
[02:04:14.600 --> 02:04:18.120]  If you're doing a cow mag, you know, you want to put that in first.
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:20.040]  So that's going to be your first injector.
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:24.120]  Then you might go to your your base, whatever you're putting in your flower,
[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:26.920]  you know, amplifier or whatever booster, whatever you put
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:30.800]  any of your nutrients or any of your, you know, pesticides.
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:33.040]  I mean, you want to be injected into your feed.
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:36.160]  You just basically have your bottle or a bucket.
[02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:39.640]  There's a hose that goes down from the injector into the bucket
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:43.880]  that sucks up those nutrients or that liquid and it slowly injects it.
[02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:46.800]  If you could bring up that picture of the dosatron again
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:50.000]  on the bottom of the injector,
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:52.560]  you'll see that round black thing
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:55.480]  that has the tube going out from it.
[02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:57.120]  That's your adjuster.
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:05:02.400]  And you're basically turn that left or right to increase or decrease the dosage.
[02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:06.320]  And it has like a scale on it that it has a front and back.
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:07.760]  You could flip it to being if you want like
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:12.440]  ratio or milliliters per gallon.
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:16.120]  And you can select the milliliters per gallon or the ratio
[02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:19.080]  like one to one hundred or one to a thousand, whatever you want your mix to be.
[02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:23.240]  The water goes through the injectors.
[02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:24.760]  It could be one injector.
[02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:28.640]  It could be, you know, as many injectors as you want, five, ten injectors.
[02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:32.120]  And usually you'll have one bottle
[02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:35.840]  or one bucket under each injector that stays committed
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:38.960]  to doing that particular nutrient.
[02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:41.960]  Once the water goes out the other end,
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:45.680]  it's coming out of all the dosatron of fertigation injectors.
[02:05:45.960 --> 02:05:47.880]  And there are other brands that do it.
[02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:49.840]  There's electronic solenoids and all kinds of stuff.
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:51.600]  Dosatron is the industry standard.
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:54.960]  And it's great because there's no electronics.
[02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:56.200]  It just works on water pressure.
[02:05:56.200 --> 02:05:56.880]  It goes out.
[02:05:56.880 --> 02:05:59.440]  The water goes out the other end and it has all the nutrients in it.
[02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:02.280]  There's mixing chambers,
[02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:04.960]  which is basically looks a lot like the injection
[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:08.480]  manifold, but it's just basically.
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:13.120]  Can't see on here.
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:14.320]  That's a nice setup, though.
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:17.800]  You can see the nutrients down there and the injectors sucking up the nutrients.
[02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:22.960]  And then after or between these, like we put one after the first injector
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:27.560]  mixing chamber because the cow mag goes in there and then the mixing chamber
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:30.920]  just basically allows the water to kind of spiral around
[02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:33.120]  before going to the next injector.
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:36.040]  So it's mixing your nutrients super well for you.
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:40.680]  And we'll put a mixing chamber like after the first one
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:42.640]  and then two more and we'll do a mixed chamber,
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:44.640]  then two more injectors will do a mixing chamber.
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:48.200]  And then the last thing it goes to is a mixing chamber before getting tested.
[02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:50.640]  And those try themselves to kit.
[02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:55.960]  You got like a blue lab meter that measures your PPM and pH or your EC.
[02:06:57.160 --> 02:07:00.240]  And and then there's a micro doser
[02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:02.920]  that is included, like in your starter kit from Dosatron
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:07.480]  that will also have the pH up and down and you can adjust it
[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:12.760]  to to automatically have a feed that once you turn your pump on
[02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:15.800]  and open your injectors, there's a little open and closed album top.
[02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:19.520]  If your valves are open, your injectors are open, it's going to flow through.
[02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:24.200]  And whatever you have on the other end is going to have perfectly prepared
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:27.560]  nutrients and nutrient solution with your water.
[02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:31.480]  You can then use a hose to feed your plants or a sprinkler system.
[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:36.080]  We we've done it with even with our organic and veganic bottle nutrients.
[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:37.680]  We've done it with a sprinkler system.
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:41.160]  Sometimes you get clogged if you're using drip irrigation or something like that
[02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:44.160]  because the nutrients can get can build up in there
[02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:47.480]  to prevent that, what you can actually do.
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:50.680]  We did.
[02:07:52.080 --> 02:07:55.320]  One of those transjectors, which was you have to have a specially designed
[02:07:55.320 --> 02:07:58.680]  from Dosatron, it has the upgraded gaskets inside.
[02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:05.360]  We did a hydrogen peroxide H2O2 in one of the Dosatron injectors.
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:07.360]  In one of the Dosatron injectors.
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:10.320]  So what we would do is we'd run the feed.
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:17.880]  And at the end of the feed cycle, we would still run the system to flush it out,
[02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:20.680]  shut off all the injectors for the nutrients.
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:24.000]  And we run the water with the H2O2
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:27.240]  through the entire system all the way to the soil.
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:31.720]  And we had it all timed and everything and automated.
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:35.400]  So that basically it would say like 43 or 44 seconds
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:41.480]  at this particular facility and the end sprinkler, the sprinkler furthest from
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:45.320]  the Dosatron would run clear water.
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:49.120]  And in that way, all the nutrients wouldn't just be sitting in the PVC pipes
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:52.360]  for a couple of days and getting all funky and nasty.
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:54.080]  We flush them out.
[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:58.640]  And then what's sitting in those pipes is the hydrogen peroxide water
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:00.920]  or zero tall or whatever else you're using.
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:04.600]  You can have it in there to keep that stuff clean and you won't get clogged up
[02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:07.000]  whether you use drip irrigation or whatever.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.160]  So that's basically how the Dosatron works.
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:15.680]  I think people that have problems with it, I, I, I, I don't trust the Dosatron.
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:19.760]  Although I trust it, like I trust it with all my babies.
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:26.320]  But still, every time before I turn on the main valve and feed everything,
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:29.000]  I'm going to run the Dosatron, have the injectors running,
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:33.320]  the nutrient solution, and I'm going to put that in a pitcher
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:35.840]  and I'm going to test that by hand with a different meter.
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:39.200]  But with a handheld Blue Labs, I'll test that pitcher.
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:42.800]  I just turn off all the valves to the beds or whatever
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:47.160]  and then turn on the valve for it to flow out and you fill up your pitcher.
[02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:50.840]  Take that pitcher, you measure nutrients and you measure it against
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:55.080]  what the Blue Lab in line with the Dosatron is saying.
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:10:01.440]  That is, I feel, the highest potential for error is if you're not double checking it,
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:04.920]  because that meter that's in line could be off.
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.360]  It could need to be calibrated.
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:10.840]  And, you know, the whole thing with the Dosatron is ease of operation.
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:13.640]  It's very easy to be like, OK, I'm turning on, let's go.
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:18.760]  And, you know, not to super double check or be on top of your numbers.
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:21.840]  That's kind of, I think, the highest potential for being
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:24.240]  for making mistakes with the Dosatron system.
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:29.600]  But again, as long as you care, you're cautious, you're slow and thoughtful,
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:32.360]  then you're going to be good. Dosatron is an amazing tool.
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:36.280]  That room we had, I did water it by hand.
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:40.440]  It took me two and a half to three hours with the Dosatron.
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:41.920]  It's like 12 to 15 minutes.
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:46.400]  Appreciate that.
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.160]  I'd have you have any experience, especially with the, you know,
[02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:53.840]  the lines getting clogged and that kind of thing where people are wanting to use
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:56.840]  surfactants, especially the yucca extract.
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:00.360]  Have you ever played around with that or anything to keep the emitters clean?
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:02.280]  I haven't.
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:06.320]  We don't think we've used to keep the the emitters and clean is.
[02:11:08.200 --> 02:11:12.200]  Is the just straight water, which didn't really work well,
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:14.160]  because even though it kind of diluted the nutrients,
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:16.360]  there was still some in there in the lines.
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:20.880]  We tried the zero tall,
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:23.280]  which works really good.
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:27.600]  It's just a little bit more pricey than just straight hydrogen peroxide.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.880]  And the hydrogen peroxide is what we found to be the best one for us.
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:37.640]  You can appreciate that.
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:43.320]  Another thing that people have always felt like is keeping their seeds
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:48.040]  in the fridge, but then some some people you see like they're pulling in,
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:51.360]  you know, they're pulling them in and out almost like every every day,
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:53.000]  every other day.
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:54.640]  Excuse me, guys.
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:57.280]  So I wanted to know, like if if you are putting them away
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:59.080]  and then you're putting them in the fridge, is that something
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:01.960]  that where you're putting them away and hey, I'm not touching those for a few months.
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:06.040]  And then if you are planning on, you know, popping seeds in a month or so,
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:09.400]  are you just kind of keeping those on the counter or is it better to keep them
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:11.760]  as fresh as you can and keep them refrigerated?
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:14.280]  These are awesome questions, man. You guys are cool.
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:19.920]  Yeah. So what I do with seeds in regards to the fridge,
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:24.400]  if I know I'm going to keep a pack of seeds for years,
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:27.560]  I'm going to keep it in the fridge and I'm going to leave it there.
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:30.360]  I'm not going to be pulling in and out because putting in the fridge,
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:32.600]  you know, you got to think what's that telling the seed.
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:34.760]  It's telling the seed that it's wintertime.
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:38.840]  And if you're taking it in and out and in and out, oh, that's weird.
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:40.440]  Like that doesn't happen in nature.
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:43.440]  It doesn't get hot and cold, hot and cold, hot and cold like that in the winter.
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:45.360]  So I would not do that.
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:46.840]  I don't think that would be advisable.
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:50.120]  Once again, defaulting to how nature works and not knowing
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:54.760]  or overstanding everything, I would default to just emulating nature.
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:58.120]  So what I do with seeds in regards to the fridge is I'm
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:01.160]  if it's a long term storage, they're going to go in the fridge,
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:04.480]  not the freezer for long term storage.
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:05.880]  And they're going to be sealed, right?
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:08.440]  Because the fridge can be a low humidity environment.
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:14.760]  What I do with seeds for planting is I'll put the seeds in the freezer
[02:13:15.360 --> 02:13:19.160]  for as much time as I can before planting.
[02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:23.640]  And then I'll take them out and I'll let them warm up for
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:27.120]  to go back to as much time as possible in the freezer.
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:30.040]  It is little as three days.
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:32.960]  You know, I'd like to see a couple, you know, a couple strong's
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:34.800]  worth of time in the freezer.
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:37.400]  So like 14 days or more would be ideal.
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:40.560]  But you can definitely get away with three days or or more.
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:43.880]  And then I'll pull them out of the freezer.
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:48.880]  I'll let them stay warm for seven to 10 days or so before I plant them.
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:54.040]  Again, this is just me defaulting to nature and nature.
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:58.880]  If you have a bunch of plants outside, they pollinate each other
[02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:03.120]  or themselves and they would die in the winter.
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:04.640]  The plants would fall.
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:09.080]  The vegetable matter would decompose the seeds with the decomposing matter
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:12.080]  getting rained on and getting snowed on over the winter.
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:15.440]  And then in the spring, it warms up.
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:18.920]  And when it warms up, that's a natural indicator for that seed
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:20.840]  that it's almost time to pop.
[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:25.480]  So I emulate that and I attribute that in part.
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:29.160]  To the increased germination rate that I get on my seeds.
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:33.800]  And are you planting those with like moon cycles
[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:36.440]  and getting deeper into the more of the metaphysical stuff
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:39.080]  or, you know, what's your process there?
[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:42.960]  Planting in coordinates
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:45.840]  for coordination with the moon cycles is not the top of my list.
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:50.720]  It's definitely something that if if it's convenient,
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:53.160]  it's around those those few days,
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:56.960]  I'll definitely postpone it or speed it up to make that happen.
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:00.160]  But it hasn't been a driving force to me so far.
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:04.800]  I got a question about self plants.
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:08.240]  You know, you get you end up with a self kind of herms
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:10.440]  that get a seed out of that plant.
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:13.200]  Do you have any experience or any of your strains
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:17.880]  based on a S1 seed or anything like that?
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:21.480]  I love S1s.
[02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:24.040]  I think it's a great, great way to lock in your genetic,
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:26.400]  you know, secures the genetic for yourself.
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:31.040]  And it's a way to share genetics with a lot of people.
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:32.600]  You know, you lock in that, you know,
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:37.920]  in regards to the increased rate of herm
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:41.240]  or intersex traits in S1 seeds, I have not seen it.
[02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:45.920]  I think if it was real, I would have seen it.
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:49.320]  Maybe something that I do with my inputs or environment
[02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:51.320]  or don't do has an impact on that.
[02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:55.520]  But I have not seen at all ever.
[02:15:56.480 --> 02:16:00.800]  Any consistent increase in intersex traits in S1s
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:04.200]  versus any other type of seed that's produced.
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:07.600]  OK, I got to agree with that, too, in my experience.
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:13.400]  However, I did recently find my first males
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:17.840]  in a tray of S1 seeds like ever.
[02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:20.760]  Have you ever come across males out of S1s?
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:23.120]  I have. OK. Yeah.
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:26.080]  I there was a pack. Oh, my gosh.
[02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:29.040]  It's chasing the past.
[02:16:29.040 --> 02:16:31.720]  You know, growers often we try to chase the past.
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:33.680]  Sometimes we try to chase that genetic we used to have.
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:36.120]  I had a pack of a certain genetic.
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:39.000]  I'm not going to say because I don't want to out the breeder or anything like that.
[02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:40.760]  But I had a pack of seeds.
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:42.040]  It was amazing.
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:44.520]  And it was like five or six years ago I planted it.
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:49.720]  And I had a tendency to like four or five that I considered to be winners.
[02:16:49.720 --> 02:16:51.560]  I kept them. I was absolutely in love with them.
[02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:58.640]  I lost that that mother, those mothers,
[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:02.720]  all of them on the same day for particular reason.
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:06.920]  And I was chasing that. Right.
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:08.000]  So I went back to the breeder.
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.680]  I said, let me get another few packs of that
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:13.560]  because I lost my phenol and I really love it.
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:18.480]  So he gave me like 25 seeds and I grew them out.
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:21.520]  And I didn't find my winner. Not one of them.
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:24.320]  And there were two that were that were feminized.
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.160]  There were two that were 100 percent male with not any female flowers whatsoever.
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:31.800]  I'm 100 percent male every way.
[02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:35.640]  So, you know, it's just chasing the past.
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.800]  I did. I have seen that
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:42.920]  every time I try to chase the past and find that old genetic.
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:47.360]  I don't say every time, but many times it just doesn't work out.
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:50.480]  It's weird. It's like it's like nature is just telling you
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:52.400]  the universe or God is just telling you move forward.
[02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.400]  Don't look in the rear view. Just move forward.
[02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:56.440]  Like that was great. But there's greater things ahead.
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:00.320]  No doubt. Yeah, the way I found these was recently, like
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:03.480]  like I said, Virginia, we just went legal in July.
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:07.760]  So I had all these S1 seeds from one particular plant.
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:09.840]  It was good genetics.
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:12.600]  So I planted a tray of these things and then kind of, you know,
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:18.640]  when July 1st comes around, all my friends got gifts of these S1 seedlings.
[02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:24.440]  And I gave a buddy four and a first time grower, never grew before.
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:28.400]  Best friend since childhood and got him set up.
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:30.560]  So he's cruising along, you know, in beds.
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:34.200]  Everything's looking awesome and, you know, look great.
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:38.600]  So we flip the flower and I'm like, you know, I flip mine at the same time,
[02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:42.760]  just kind of doing it simultaneously without having to kind of be there together.
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:47.840]  And about two weeks in, I'm like, well, how are you know, how are you looking, man?
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:51.040]  You seeing anything, you know, seeing any hairs, any pistols?
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:55.240]  And so I got two that look like they're farther along than the others.
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:58.240]  And so, all right.
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:01.520]  So I slid by there and I'm like, damn, man, you got two males.
[02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:05.040]  Right. So we kind of take advantage of the situation.
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:06.920]  I said, why don't you put those out back?
[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:08.880]  You know, you don't have anything going on outside.
[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:10.720]  Let's keep some pollen.
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:12.320]  And this leads into my next question.
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:14.200]  What's your best way to keep pollen, man?
[02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:16.840]  Because we ended up keeping some.
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:20.000]  I don't think it was the best method and it kind of got a little wet.
[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:24.360]  So how do you store your pollen or get some tips on that?
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:26.400]  Yeah, Brethren, that's the key right there.
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:31.080]  Moisture, water will kill it, make it unviable right away.
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:37.920]  Even if that water is moisture that is evaporating from,
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:45.400]  you know, the seed inside the package or inside the vessel, whatever you have in,
[02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:50.280]  you know, water is going to kill it.
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:53.760]  You know, water is going to kill that pollen right away.
[02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:57.040]  Matter of fact, I had. Yeah.
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:20:00.520]  It's a useful trick to know that water kills pollen because,
[02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:04.640]  you know, you don't be doing foliar sprays in your in your breeding rooms
[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:08.040]  or your reversal rooms and, you know, stuff like that, vice versa.
[02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:12.240]  If you have a plant that you find that herms and you're concerned
[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:15.800]  that she might pollinate, but, you know, do a foliar spray.
[02:20:15.800 --> 02:20:18.200]  It's going to kill all the existing pollen.
[02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:21.760]  And if you have to, like if you got a male surprise plant or a male
[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:25.160]  or hermy surprise plant in a room and you need to remove it from that room
[02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:29.360]  and you don't want to shake it too much because the pollen do that foliar first.
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:33.360]  That water is going to kill almost all that pollen right in contact.
[02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:36.960]  So that's going to kill right away.
[02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:39.480]  Drying out the pollen is the most important thing.
[02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:42.520]  I over dry it.
[02:20:42.760 --> 02:20:43.760]  We're not smoking it.
[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:46.920]  So I I put it in a room is like eighty five, ninety degrees.
[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:52.440]  I put a dehumidifier constantly running and just dry it out like 25 percent
[02:20:52.440 --> 02:20:55.720]  humidity and just let it sit in there for like seven to ten days.
[02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:58.880]  That's the most important part is getting it all the way dry.
[02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:03.280]  If it has any moisture content left in it, it will become unviable
[02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:05.480]  and it won't work regardless.
[02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:08.280]  So just keeping it dry once it's completely dry.
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:10.360]  I put it in an airtight container.
[02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:12.880]  I vacuum seal it and put it in the freezer
[02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:15.280]  and then it can last for years and years and years.
[02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:18.280]  Very good, man. It makes a lot of sense.
[02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:21.800]  We don't realize that that pollen just came off the plant.
[02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:24.600]  It's still got the same moisture content as the plant.
[02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:29.440]  So I think what what we did or what he did was he wrapped it in foil,
[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:31.360]  put it in the freezer.
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:33.680]  Then when it thawed out, it still had that moisture in it.
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:35.040]  It kind of killed that pollen.
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:36.920]  So, yeah, drying it out is key.
[02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:38.360]  Yeah, drying it's key.
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:40.000]  And it makes it so much easier to work with, too,
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.720]  because you have like powder versus like almost like a paste.
[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:47.040]  You know, you're pulling out a 10 vol almost a little pasty because of that.
[02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:49.000]  OK, so you've been there, done that.
[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:53.400]  So I took the paste and I still wonder, you know, I said, well, shoot,
[02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:54.800]  let me pollinate a couple lower.
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:57.880]  So that explains why I don't have any seeds
[02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:00.200]  in those lower.
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:02.680]  And, you know, speaking of pollinating lower, that's
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.200]  I started doing that in all my testing rooms.
[02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:07.920]  So like right now I'm testing the second wave of the creature.
[02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:12.120]  Those tester plants, even though I don't know they're going to be winners or not,
[02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:15.280]  I go and pollinate a lower bud on every one of those plants.
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:16.000]  I did it with the
[02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:20.680]  I had some Hawaiian punch pollen and I had some white truffle pollen.
[02:22:20.680 --> 02:22:24.280]  So all of the new plants that are coming through that I breed
[02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:27.680]  that are being tested, they're getting a little Q-tip
[02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:30.360]  dab glob mop, actually.
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:32.880]  They're getting a little glob mop of pollen on lowers.
[02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:36.360]  And the ones that are super fired in the end.
[02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:38.560]  Well, I've got seeds. Let's plant those.
[02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:41.400]  The ones that aren't super fired, it's like, well, let's put those away for a while.
[02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:42.280]  See what happens.
[02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:44.880]  So that gives you a jump start on your next round of testing
[02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:46.960]  if you feel like you want to go there.
[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:48.560]  Absolutely.
[02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:52.920]  And then that's all the truffle oil came from that kind of idea.
[02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:55.040]  Just one little branch, a couple of little dogs.
[02:22:55.040 --> 02:22:58.960]  And look, I got four winners of truffle oil to share with the world.
[02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:00.040]  And it's stunning.
[02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:02.800]  It's clone only, but I'm doing a reversal on one.
[02:23:02.800 --> 02:23:04.160]  So it's going to be S1.
[02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:06.160]  So that'll be more and more people that can taste that.
[02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:08.040]  She's an amazing plant. Everybody should have her.
[02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:11.120]  So, yeah, I like it.
[02:23:11.120 --> 02:23:15.240]  And, you know, I was just thinking with the white truffle tester room,
[02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:19.960]  I've got 230 plants in there testing.
[02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:22.480]  I'm going to hit every single one of those, bro.
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:24.480]  I've still got white truffle pollen.
[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:26.600]  I got a grip of white truffle pollen.
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:30.520]  I'm collecting dip and sticks pollen over the next few days.
[02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:33.360]  She's just spewing pollen everywhere in that room.
[02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:36.800]  And then I'm doing that other reversal room with the creature
[02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:38.520]  doing chimera take two.
[02:23:38.520 --> 02:23:40.400]  So I'll have the creature pollen.
[02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:46.160]  So all those truffle testers, all 230 of those white truffle tester plants,
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:50.360]  they're all going to get hit with all three of these on a lower, all three of these.
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:55.560]  So then, you know, 230 plants times, you know, three different pollens.
[02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:56.560]  It's going to be fun.
[02:23:56.560 --> 02:23:58.400]  So I'm just going to have all these little things where it's just,
[02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:02.000]  you know, 10 seeds of this, five seeds, 15 seeds of that.
[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:05.840]  And I'll just run those and I'll just have them for my clone menu.
[02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:11.360]  I can share them that way or I can ask one them or I can breed them in the future.
[02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:17.080]  That's actually the case with the the chimera run number two,
[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:18.680]  where I'm reversing the creature.
[02:24:18.680 --> 02:24:20.760]  So I've got two creatures in there.
[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:23.760]  I've got three white truffles.
[02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:28.800]  I've got one platinum punch, 13 times white truffle in there
[02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:33.360]  and then one chimera three.
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:35.840]  So that'd be like a back cross,
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:41.240]  you know, and that that platinum punch, 13 times white truffle is the only seed
[02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:46.040]  I got. There was only one seed out of that because I hit a branch
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:48.680]  and it just didn't take as much as well.
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:50.680]  I thought I only had one seed grew it out.
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:53.280]  Super fire, super fire.
[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:55.000]  She's exactly what I wanted.
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.440]  And now she's in there. She can play with creature.
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:25:01.560]  So it just creates all these unique little opportunities to have fun and breed
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:04.560]  and and take this and that and just have all these special little girls
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:06.320]  and play with. It's really fun.
[02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:10.760]  Yeah. What's your process for if you if you want to share it for self?
[02:25:10.760 --> 02:25:11.640]  And how do you do that?
[02:25:11.640 --> 02:25:12.560]  You just stress on them.
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:14.080]  So they harm or what?
[02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:15.680]  I'm sure you do a lot more than that.
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:16.600]  What's your process?
[02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:20.600]  I use silver, silver, biosulfate.
[02:25:21.160 --> 02:25:22.960]  Yeah. Yes. Right.
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:24.960]  All right. The traditional way I got.
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:28.480]  Yeah. From 2020 Mendocino.
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:29.960]  I used our spray.
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:32.040]  That's always worked really good for me.
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:33.240]  And I just love it.
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:35.960]  It works perfect every single time.
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:38.360]  All right. So is that just pretty much one application?
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:40.680]  And it just it takes it from there.
[02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:46.800]  So so I'm a new new new to breeding, and I just learned the answer to that question.
[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:50.200]  So it really depends on what your goal is with the room.
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:57.080]  If you want your reversal plant to simply create pollen and pollinate the next
[02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:02.200]  the whole room and you're not looking for S1 seeds, then what you want to do is you want
[02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:09.240]  to start spraying it seven days before going to flower because it takes 14 days to to actually.
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:14.440]  Manifest male flowers at minimum.
[02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:21.480]  So if you spray that on day one, you're going to get female flowers on that plant for the
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:24.840]  first 14 days. They'll be minimal, but they'll be there.
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:30.520]  And then after that, the new flower growth will be male flowers.
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:35.320]  And then you're not going to get pollen until like day 25 or 30.
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:41.720]  Which works great if you want to do an S1.
[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:48.680]  Right. So on an S1, I'll spray like day five because then day 19 I'm starting to get male
[02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:55.640]  flowers and day like 35 I'm starting to get male pollen, which means that I have like 19 days
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:00.040]  to get a large number of female flowers that are ready to get pregnant.
[02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:05.000]  And then the 14 days kicked in and then 10 more days go.
[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:09.960]  So you've got these female flowers are just begging for pollen.
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:12.600]  And then you're going to get a ton of S1 seeds.
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:18.040]  If you want the plant that's reversed to pollinate the whole room and you don't care about S1s from
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:24.120]  that particular plant, you can sprayer starting like day seven before flower.
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:29.080]  And then she probably won't produce any female flowers whatsoever.
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:32.280]  You're only going to get male flowers. You'll get pollen sooner.
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:36.600]  So you get a larger number of seeds from all the crosses that you're doing.
[02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:39.000]  Yeah, that's how that works, basically.
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:46.520]  And then so if I spray if I sprayed on seven days before flower, then I'll sprayer
[02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:54.680]  three days before flower. I'll spray day one, day five, and then that's all she'll need.
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:57.240]  And you're going to get nothing but male flowers.
[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:06.520]  If I'm looking for S1s and I want them on the same plant, then we'll spray day one.
[02:28:07.080 --> 02:28:10.840]  And then what I'll do is I'll once again, I'll spray on day five.
[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:15.800]  And then I'll spray on day eight, ten, fifteen.
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:25.480]  If I don't advise that, because if you're doing an S1 and other girls in the same room,
[02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:30.520]  which is the way I do it, you're going to sacrifice the total number of seeds with the
[02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:33.560]  other girls that are all female that you're crossing and you're hitting with that reverse
[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:42.360]  what I like to do is if you're doing a reversal and you want the crosses plus S1 seeds all at
[02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:49.560]  once, what I advise is putting multiple plants that is the reversal genetic in the room and
[02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:55.640]  reversing one or two of them. So in the dip and sticks room, I put four dip and sticks.
[02:28:56.200 --> 02:29:02.680]  I reverse the whole of two of them. And then the other two, I just got like one or two branches
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:09.560]  that I sprayed. So those two that I barely sprayed a branch or two, they'll only reverse
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:14.280]  on that branch. The rest will be completely female. So those plants, that's where I'm going
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:22.200]  to get all my S1s. The two plants that are sprayed from day seven before flower in that case,
[02:29:22.200 --> 02:29:27.000]  they're just going to give pollen. I just want a ton of pollen to make sure everybody gets
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:31.800]  well pregnant. So there's three different ways to do it, depending on what you want.
[02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:37.880]  Yeah. I like that. That last method for like, kind of like the home grower, you know,
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:42.760]  you can actually isolate that one branch, get some seeds if that's what you want to do, man.
[02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:46.120]  Good, good stuff there. Yeah, bro. Yeah, man. Yeah.
[02:29:47.640 --> 02:29:52.920]  I had a friend that called the Tracy Morgan. He has a scale where he's like,
[02:29:52.920 --> 02:29:55.000]  everybody getting pregnant up in here tonight.
[02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:55.500]  Yeah.
[02:29:56.220 --> 02:29:57.500]  That's what that video is saying.
[02:29:58.380 --> 02:30:00.140]  This is the Tracy Morgan approach.
[02:30:00.140 --> 02:30:05.420]  When you shake that bush and that pollen, it creates a cloud in your room. It's like,
[02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:09.500]  it's so fulfilling. You're creating the future there. You know what I mean?
[02:30:10.140 --> 02:30:11.340]  Yeah. Last time.
[02:30:11.340 --> 02:30:17.260]  I just love it. I just bask in the feeling of like satisfaction for hours after doing that. It's just
[02:30:17.260 --> 02:30:23.260]  so amazing. I absolutely love it. It's so fun. And then when you see the seeds start forming
[02:30:23.260 --> 02:30:28.380]  and there's every process in it, it's so fun. I wish I would have started doing it earlier.
[02:30:29.100 --> 02:30:31.020]  It's just so much fun and enjoyable.
[02:30:31.020 --> 02:30:35.340]  I mean, I'm like, you got me here like day one, man. I'm glad I'm learning and hearing it first
[02:30:35.340 --> 02:30:42.140]  from someone like you because a lot of this stuff, you know, I could look up along the way, but man,
[02:30:42.140 --> 02:30:47.980]  at this stage that I'm at, I want to hear from the man and that's why I asked you on here. So,
[02:30:47.980 --> 02:30:49.820]  man, much respect again.
[02:30:49.820 --> 02:30:51.820]  Yeah, man. Love and honor. Yes, Rasta.
[02:30:52.780 --> 02:30:57.100]  Yeah, it's all love. I love to share it and it's good information. I hope people can take it all
[02:30:57.100 --> 02:31:02.540]  and use it. And, you know, I think the goal is for everybody to have better cannabis. That's my goal.
[02:31:02.540 --> 02:31:07.260]  That's like, I want everybody to be smoking. I want there to be so much fire cannabis that
[02:31:07.260 --> 02:31:11.180]  booze is just not a thing. It's like Mexican brick. We just gone. You know what I mean?
[02:31:11.180 --> 02:31:15.020]  I think Mexican brickweed still exists. I haven't seen it in years, but, you know.
[02:31:15.580 --> 02:31:20.060]  They keep snagging it on the ocean, like the boat, you know, keep bringing in boatloads of this,
[02:31:20.060 --> 02:31:22.620]  you know, they seized, but like, who wants that?
[02:31:23.180 --> 02:31:24.060]  Who's buying this?
[02:31:26.540 --> 02:31:28.060]  You know, who wants that?
[02:31:30.060 --> 02:31:36.460]  I think they always sprinkle the marijuana, cannabis over the real shipments, the real work.
[02:31:37.660 --> 02:31:38.300]  There you go.
[02:31:38.300 --> 02:31:42.700]  They're using those big submarines to move more than just cannabis.
[02:31:42.700 --> 02:31:44.780]  And then that's what they found over there.
[02:31:45.740 --> 02:31:46.220]  That's right.
[02:31:46.220 --> 02:31:50.060]  Keep them busy with this booth while you're bringing the cocaine in or whatever else you're
[02:31:50.060 --> 02:31:50.300]  doing.
[02:31:53.660 --> 02:31:59.020]  Yeah, no booth. I want everybody to be smoking fire, fire, fire, fire. When I moved to Oklahoma,
[02:31:59.020 --> 02:32:03.660]  bro, it was so sad and so much better. Now, a lot of people have come here.
[02:32:04.220 --> 02:32:10.140]  A lot of really reputable people in the industry have come here and are helping change the booth.
[02:32:10.140 --> 02:32:15.740]  You know, it's, it's great to see like pretty much any dispensary I walk into in the state,
[02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:21.660]  you'll see my strains. You'll see not grown by me, but grown by my, all my family that,
[02:32:22.460 --> 02:32:26.780]  that comes and grabs clones for me. And it's great. There's many dispensaries. You'll see
[02:32:26.780 --> 02:32:32.460]  like a third of their menu or my cuts, my selections and stuff. So it's very, it's very
[02:32:32.460 --> 02:32:38.300]  fulfilling. I love thinking that at any time people are like many, many people are smoking
[02:32:38.300 --> 02:32:43.660]  cannabis that resulted from, from my work, either from my selections or from my breeding or from
[02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:49.340]  actually me growing flowers or the rosin is really, really fulfilling. Very pleasurable.
[02:32:50.540 --> 02:32:57.580]  Yes. Gotta be definitely. Well, Virginia is coming up brother. So we'll stay, we'll stay in
[02:32:57.580 --> 02:33:03.340]  touch. Yes, Rasta. Absolutely. Yeah, man. Hit me up for that Dover gas. I got you, bro. Roger.
[02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:05.500]  Yeah. And I got a couple other things for you too.
[02:33:09.660 --> 02:33:12.460]  On YouTube, Brian, you're not left out Rasta. I got something for you. Just let me know.
[02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:18.780]  Yes, sir. This is usually the part where we kind of open it up to the audience. If they want to
[02:33:18.780 --> 02:33:24.540]  kind of pick your brain. So Mr. Westport, if you want to, if you're there, sir, if you want, I'm
[02:33:24.540 --> 02:33:36.100]  kind of man that out. I know that a little Q and a there. Yes. Let's do that. Chad, you there, buddy.
[02:33:39.130 --> 02:33:44.410]  You can hear me now, right? Okay, perfect. I was, I was trying to do the voice in the sky
[02:33:44.490 --> 02:33:48.970]  in the background, but it's not as recognizable as Peter. So people are still like, what?
[02:33:50.810 --> 02:33:55.770]  I'm over here. Yeah, definitely. You guys have been nailing the questions as they've come in,
[02:33:55.770 --> 02:34:00.730]  but I'm going to keep my eye on chat right now. So guys, please do get your questions in and we'll
[02:34:00.730 --> 02:34:06.970]  get them up. You know, again, people were where can we find some of this wonderful stuff?
[02:34:07.930 --> 02:34:13.610]  I got one too chair while you're waiting on somebody to come in with one. Yeah. A lot of
[02:34:13.610 --> 02:34:19.130]  people, you know, I see, you know, they're a breeder now or they're selling seeds or clones
[02:34:19.130 --> 02:34:26.970]  and things like that. Is it, do you think there's a number say like I got a bag seed, awesome.
[02:34:27.930 --> 02:34:33.610]  A winner came out of it. Right. How long do you, would it take to stabilize that to where you feel
[02:34:33.610 --> 02:34:38.570]  comfortable? Like, in other words, you wouldn't, would you just S one that, and now you feel
[02:34:38.570 --> 02:34:46.730]  confident. I'm sure you don't. No, no. And that's kind of the, they're really super cool
[02:34:46.730 --> 02:34:53.370]  thing about dusting a single branch here and there. Like the, the PP, the platinum punch,
[02:34:53.370 --> 02:35:00.570]  13 times white truffle was one seed. But I did that with a couple other plants and, you know,
[02:35:00.570 --> 02:35:05.610]  they like to truffle all others. There's 12 of those seats. I grew them out. There wasn't one
[02:35:05.610 --> 02:35:12.570]  Herm. Like 12 isn't a huge number of plants, but there were no Herms, not one, not one flower,
[02:35:12.570 --> 02:35:19.610]  no problems. So I would feel confident releasing that because platinum punch one doesn't term
[02:35:21.290 --> 02:35:26.810]  truffle. Very, very rare. We have any problem with that. So I'm pretty confident already.
[02:35:26.810 --> 02:35:32.410]  But then when I, myself grow out 12 and they're all perfect with no Herms, I would feel confident
[02:35:32.410 --> 02:35:38.410]  with that as long with just the germination tests. Right? So I'm, I'm reversing that. I'm
[02:35:38.410 --> 02:35:43.610]  doing the truffle on number one, uh, as, as a reversal right now, I'm going to release the S1
[02:35:43.610 --> 02:35:48.330]  seeds in about three months. I'm going to harvest those. I'm going to dry them. I'm going to do a
[02:35:48.330 --> 02:35:54.410]  germination test. If they pop a hundred percent or very close to it, I'm good to go. I'm going to
[02:35:54.890 --> 02:36:02.250]  release those. If it wasn't an S1, I would not release it untested at all. Um, fully,
[02:36:02.250 --> 02:36:08.490]  it had to be fully, fully tested. So there are exceptions, but I just kind of based it on how
[02:36:08.490 --> 02:36:15.050]  I feel and some contributing factors in this case, PP one, solid truffles, pretty solid.
[02:36:15.050 --> 02:36:20.090]  Um, and I grew 12 out, they were all solid and they're fire. Like I'm going to go ahead and
[02:36:20.090 --> 02:36:28.330]  trust those. Um, but if I haven't tested it, if it's a new cross, no way I'm going to release
[02:36:28.330 --> 02:36:33.130]  that without testing it. Somebody asked what the Instagram was on here. It's a belief loves
[02:36:33.130 --> 02:36:41.210]  Canada and belief Canada love. Yep. Those are the two that we're using right now. Um, we've had like
[02:36:41.210 --> 02:36:46.090]  50 of them deleted in the last year. So that's that read it. You can get us on Reddit. You can
[02:36:46.090 --> 02:36:52.970]  get us on Twitter. You can get us on LinkedIn. You can email me at belief cannabis.com as well,
[02:36:53.530 --> 02:36:58.090]  or belief cannabis at gmail.com. Um, there was another question just popped up. I missed it.
[02:36:59.770 --> 02:37:02.490]  The question was seeds or seed stock.
[02:37:03.930 --> 02:37:08.810]  So older seed stock, uh, Thomas, that's a great question, bro. Um, it's interesting
[02:37:08.810 --> 02:37:16.010]  because we just popped some seeds from Vietnam that were from 1969. Um, there were a couple of
[02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:24.330]  guys, it's really a cool story. Um, it's a friend of a friend who served in Vietnam. He had a buddy
[02:37:24.330 --> 02:37:29.770]  who he served with in Vietnam who was, who was his really good friend. And they were hand in hand
[02:37:29.770 --> 02:37:37.290]  marching through, you know, whatever the trying times they had in the war. And they were buying
[02:37:37.290 --> 02:37:44.490]  cannabis or acquiring cannabis from local villages along the way. And they kept, um, I think like 17
[02:37:44.490 --> 02:37:52.090]  seeds, um, is what I got from what they thought was the best cannabis they had found in Vietnam
[02:37:52.730 --> 02:38:00.330]  in there. Like, I guess they're two years in the war or whatnot. They, uh, they kept 17 seeds and
[02:38:00.330 --> 02:38:06.890]  I think they kept more, uh, well actually no, they didn't. They only kept 17 because the one guy
[02:38:06.890 --> 02:38:12.730]  who gave them to me, who gifted them to me, he said, these are all the seeds. My buddy, um,
[02:38:13.610 --> 02:38:19.210]  in Vietnam who we collected these with didn't make it back. Right. So they were like really good
[02:38:19.210 --> 02:38:24.570]  friends in Vietnam. And one of them died. They had collected seeds together and they were going to
[02:38:24.570 --> 02:38:30.650]  come back to America in 1970 or whatever. And they were going to grow those out because they were so
[02:38:30.650 --> 02:38:36.970]  stunned by how fire it was. So I got those seeds, um, gifted to me.
[02:38:39.690 --> 02:38:48.690]  Excuse me, no water break. Those seeds were gifted to me, uh, about a year ago.
[02:38:50.050 --> 02:38:56.530]  And yeah, I mean, come on, 55 year old seeds. I think it was when I got them and he had stored
[02:38:56.530 --> 02:39:00.290]  them pretty well. He said he kept them in a freezer for the most part, kept them in his
[02:39:00.290 --> 02:39:06.370]  refrigerator a couple of years. They were in a closet. Uh, and he gave them to me and we just
[02:39:06.370 --> 02:39:11.010]  are, are, are normal, uh, germination tech. We didn't do anything different. I'm really
[02:39:11.010 --> 02:39:17.170]  confident about my germination tech. So I don't really, um, I didn't really see a need to kind of
[02:39:17.890 --> 02:39:23.650]  score them or, or scrape them or sandpaper them or do any of these other things that people do.
[02:39:23.650 --> 02:39:29.810]  Again, I don't see that happening in nature. I'm not really with it, um, without a lot of tests and
[02:39:29.810 --> 02:39:34.930]  so forth. So yeah, I did the same tech, but I put them in the freezer. They were in the freezer about a
[02:39:34.930 --> 02:39:40.690]  month and then, uh, we took them out, warmed them up and germinated them. And I think we got 16 or
[02:39:40.690 --> 02:39:47.170]  15 out of 17 to pop. They all popped. Wow. All strong. And, uh, yeah, they're looking great.
[02:39:47.170 --> 02:39:52.050]  Everything's going really well. So we'll have, well, they're actually, uh, they're going into
[02:39:52.050 --> 02:39:57.490]  flower like in 15 or 20 days. So we'll know what's up with them real soon. Like the longest veg ever,
[02:39:57.490 --> 02:40:01.170]  but yeah, they're go, they're finally got a room and they're going into flower. So I'm kind of
[02:40:01.170 --> 02:40:08.370]  excited to see what that's like. It's like 55, 56 year old seed. So how are they looking right now?
[02:40:08.370 --> 02:40:13.490]  Are they just like looking really long, thin leafy, you know, sativa ish. What are you seeing?
[02:40:14.370 --> 02:40:24.530]  Yeah. I mean, the phenols are all over the place. Um, 15, 14 or 15 out of, I think out of those
[02:40:24.530 --> 02:40:36.100]  number are the total number germinated. Um, five are very sativa dominant and they're like funky.
[02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:40.100]  They're like, I don't know. They just look like Southeast Asia. They just look like,
[02:40:40.100 --> 02:40:44.660]  I don't know, like chili peppers. It just looked like they'd be, they're just really kinky girls.
[02:40:44.660 --> 02:40:51.700]  Um, there's two that are very short and squat with big fat leaves. And then the rest are kind
[02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:57.380]  of average looking in terms of the structure and the families and so forth. But those five that
[02:40:57.380 --> 02:41:03.380]  are really kinky and kind of sexy with a long, you know, very sativa and like, I don't know,
[02:41:03.380 --> 02:41:07.940]  they just got this thing that was really, really cool. I'm very excited. And even if they're not
[02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:11.700]  super fire, I'm going to breathe with them and just find something in there that I like,
[02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:14.900]  you know what I mean? All right. That was going to be my next question. Or did they get a pass
[02:41:14.900 --> 02:41:20.340]  on the 27 point because of their age? You know, they're not going to, they're not going to get
[02:41:20.340 --> 02:41:26.580]  a pass, but they might get some bonus points for that. They get some bonus points to help.
[02:41:26.580 --> 02:41:29.140]  There was another question that popped up there for you.
[02:41:29.140 --> 02:41:38.580]  Okay, cool. At what strong or day do you pollinate? Um, so the, the whole rooms,
[02:41:38.580 --> 02:41:44.660]  I do the whole room. So I'll put, so for the dip and sticks room, there's 39 plants or 40
[02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:51.220]  plants in there. So like that with the different sticks plants. So, um, they started pollinating
[02:41:52.180 --> 02:41:58.660]  right around day 27. I think it was, I started spraying before it, it took them,
[02:41:59.540 --> 02:42:06.500]  I think day 15, 14 is when the, the first pollen sack started very first started to barely pop.
[02:42:07.300 --> 02:42:13.060]  So, um, I mean, just as soon as they start popping the way I am like a kid in there,
[02:42:13.060 --> 02:42:19.380]  I'm like super excited. So when I see the first male flowers pop, I'm picking them off and I'm
[02:42:19.380 --> 02:42:25.060]  going around to my select girls and I'm dusting them manually. You know what I mean? I just love
[02:42:25.060 --> 02:42:31.540]  doing that. It's just so sexy. It's so fun. So I'll do that. And then, you know, within seven
[02:42:31.540 --> 02:42:38.340]  to 10 days, you got so much male flowers opening up. I just grabbed the main stock and just shake
[02:42:39.060 --> 02:42:44.420]  shaker and shaker and it just dusts everywhere. So I'm pollinating from the moment those flowers
[02:42:44.420 --> 02:42:50.180]  are opening. It's not as if I'm bringing the pollen into the room from a separate source.
[02:42:50.820 --> 02:42:58.180]  If I do that. And when I do that, I like to do that as so I'd like to do it as soon as possible.
[02:42:58.180 --> 02:43:05.380]  Cause that means more mature seeds earlier, but it also means less overall seeds because if you're
[02:43:05.380 --> 02:43:12.180]  pollinating on day 10, when there's only, you know, four or five female flowers at one node,
[02:43:12.180 --> 02:43:16.660]  then you're only going to get a maximum of four or five seeds. Whereas if you let that female
[02:43:16.660 --> 02:43:22.340]  continue to ask for pollen in the form of creating more flowers, you're going to get
[02:43:22.980 --> 02:43:30.820]  a higher quantity of seeds. The only, the only caveat or warning there is that make sure you
[02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:37.220]  go long enough because seeds need 45 to 55 days to fully mature once they're pollinated.
[02:43:38.820 --> 02:43:47.300]  So is that per flower? So if I take one branch pollinate, so that, that will no longer produce
[02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:54.580]  any more calyxes anymore. Right. Am I right? Okay. But the rest of the plant will continue to do
[02:43:54.580 --> 02:44:00.580]  whatever it does. It will slow down depending on how many branches are pollinated. So you
[02:44:00.580 --> 02:44:05.460]  don't really want to do it too much. Like, you know, if you have a really small plant,
[02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:09.540]  like we feel that with just two branches, you know, I'm talking about dusting a couple
[02:44:09.540 --> 02:44:13.300]  little things in the bottom. I'm talking about some very little things because you can distract
[02:44:13.300 --> 02:44:18.500]  that girl. The reason she's continuing to flower is because she's horny, right? She wants pollen.
[02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:24.180]  She hasn't gotten it yet. So that's, that's why we have cannabis in today's idea of what it looks
[02:44:24.180 --> 02:44:28.340]  like. Like the flowers we're harvesting don't exist in nature because they would have been
[02:44:28.340 --> 02:44:32.500]  pollinated by them. And once they're pollinated, they start focusing all their energy on building
[02:44:32.500 --> 02:44:39.140]  good, healthy seeds instead of building bigger flowers for us to smoke. So yeah, it's really
[02:44:39.140 --> 02:44:43.700]  interesting. The first time I reversed the whole room, it was actually a tent. So the first time
[02:44:43.700 --> 02:44:49.620]  I reversed the whole tent, like as soon as you pollinate, they just stop getting bigger and fire
[02:44:49.620 --> 02:44:55.140]  and stinkier and more trickle. They stop all that. And it's like a shock. You're like, Whoa,
[02:44:59.300 --> 02:45:03.540]  but it makes sense. And I, you know, I kind of just patiently waited and I was like, okay,
[02:45:03.540 --> 02:45:08.500]  yeah, it's just, that's, what's going to happen. They're now, you know, it's like a married,
[02:45:08.500 --> 02:45:11.620]  it's like a woman. She doesn't need to go to the bar anymore. She's, she's married. She's
[02:45:11.620 --> 02:45:16.260]  going to stay at home. She's got her ring. Stay home and take care of the kids. That's exactly
[02:45:16.260 --> 02:45:21.140]  what she's doing. She's not out there flaunting it anymore. That's right. Yeah. Okay. So here's
[02:45:21.140 --> 02:45:27.540]  another question from a Berserker. It looks like a belief. What's the average percentage of plants
[02:45:27.540 --> 02:45:33.540]  that you take in a flower when doing large phenol hunts and how many usually cold and veg? I don't
[02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:40.420]  call many in veg. Like I'm an equal opportunity phenol hunter. I'm not trying to kill any plant.
[02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:46.740]  Like I, I probably, if you're talking about strictly commercial reasons, I probably hold
[02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:52.660]  onto way too many plants in the phenol hunt because it would probably make a lot more economic
[02:45:52.660 --> 02:45:58.660]  sense and business sense to just chop the ones that are runts, right? Not runts with a Z,
[02:45:59.300 --> 02:46:08.180]  runts with an S, the small girls. So, but I just love them. I don't want to kill them. So I don't,
[02:46:08.180 --> 02:46:12.820]  I keep them around and I really don't care. I don't care if it costs me a little bit. That's
[02:46:12.820 --> 02:46:17.940]  one of the benefits of only having four by four inch spacing. I'm not losing, you know, a third
[02:46:17.940 --> 02:46:22.580]  of a light. I'm losing one hundredth of a light or one hundred and twentieth of a light. It's not
[02:46:22.580 --> 02:46:33.780]  that big of a deal. So I, I don't really call them even, I've got, I've got a couple of trays of
[02:46:34.500 --> 02:46:40.340]  mutant plants that I'm just growing. I really don't know what I'm gonna do with them, but I
[02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:45.140]  don't want to kill them. There's like 15 of them. And I knew before I planted that strain that
[02:46:45.140 --> 02:46:49.380]  there was going to be a lot of mutants in there. And I, that's why I planted 50 of those seeds,
[02:46:49.380 --> 02:46:52.980]  because I wanted to find a winner. And I knew that I'd have to plant a lot more. There's like
[02:46:53.540 --> 02:47:00.340]  15 of them and they're crazy. One of them looks like, what's that one super crazy plant that
[02:47:00.340 --> 02:47:05.540]  people are growing? The freak. Yeah, the freak show, right? Yeah. One of them looks exactly like
[02:47:05.540 --> 02:47:14.820]  her. Almost all of them grow like snail pace slow, like super slow. One of them's half mutant
[02:47:14.820 --> 02:47:19.380]  and a half regular. I just like them. I think they're really cool. Who am I to judge them? Like,
[02:47:19.380 --> 02:47:24.340]  I don't know enough to judge them really that much. I know that they're not winners for my
[02:47:24.340 --> 02:47:29.860]  clone list or for commercial sales. I know that, but I just love them and I don't want to kill them.
[02:47:29.860 --> 02:47:33.780]  So I give them all a chance. There was another part of that question. He said, what percentage
[02:47:33.780 --> 02:47:37.780]  of plants do you take in? I think it was kind of the same question. I take almost all of them into
[02:47:37.780 --> 02:47:44.100]  flower. It gets kind of complex because the beds, you know, if you're lining up like
[02:47:45.060 --> 02:47:51.140]  Platinum Punch one and two and three and four and five in a row, sometimes you can't necessarily do
[02:47:51.140 --> 02:47:55.220]  that because number three may be a really small girl. So we'll just put her on the edge of the bed
[02:47:55.940 --> 02:48:02.020]  and put the taller plants in the middle. But still they just get taken over most times. And we,
[02:48:02.020 --> 02:48:05.620]  we end up with a very small plant that has like two grams of flower.
[02:48:07.300 --> 02:48:11.700]  I think that's better than killing it. That's just me. Like I think that plants know things
[02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:15.780]  and I think that they know when you do things like that. I don't want to be, I don't want to
[02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:21.220]  be convicted in the court of plant public opinion that I killed plants unnecessarily.
[02:48:22.180 --> 02:48:27.220]  It's all part of the vibe, man. Yeah. Part of that vibe you were talking about earlier,
[02:48:27.220 --> 02:48:33.620]  I think it's being at one with nature, you know, unnecessary killing. It can't be good.
[02:48:33.620 --> 02:48:40.980]  If you got the room, let them ride. I got the room. So how long would you value your Fino
[02:48:42.500 --> 02:48:48.100]  to see its full potential? Sometimes when you grow plants four by four inch spacing,
[02:48:49.300 --> 02:48:53.060]  it's, it's rare, but sometimes they won't give you everything they got.
[02:48:54.020 --> 02:48:59.780]  Right. It's just some plants love to go big, I guess. Not really sure why it is,
[02:49:00.340 --> 02:49:04.900]  but I've observed that enough times to say that definitively some plants won't
[02:49:05.460 --> 02:49:10.500]  show their true colors unless they go big. It's a very, very small percentage.
[02:49:11.860 --> 02:49:18.740]  It's probably one out of a thousand. So it's not enough for me to really act on or change my,
[02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:24.180]  my whole MO of phenol hunting, but it does happen. I'm aware of that. I'm aware of the
[02:49:24.180 --> 02:49:31.220]  fact that doing the four inch spacing, I might not find or select somebody that would have
[02:49:31.220 --> 02:49:36.260]  otherwise been selected. But I think that's far outweighed by the fact that I have thousands of
[02:49:36.260 --> 02:49:43.300]  other plants that I wouldn't have had, you know, if I would have grown like that. So I'm comfortable
[02:49:43.380 --> 02:49:50.740]  with that. Nice. Yep. We got sleepy dog.
[02:49:54.020 --> 02:49:57.060]  It was amazing. This is awesome. I was going to ask you real quick.
[02:49:57.060 --> 02:50:02.420]  Is there ever when you are keeping those little runs around? Is there ever like a Rudy Ruediger
[02:50:02.420 --> 02:50:08.260]  from the, the Notre Dame fame and that kind of stuff where one just was a small little run that
[02:50:08.420 --> 02:50:15.780]  just had her day kind of thing? Oh yeah. Yeah. My little girl, Passionfruit
[02:50:17.940 --> 02:50:25.060]  and Gashenfruit. They're both that. Gashenfruit is love seed 2.288. She was extremely small,
[02:50:25.060 --> 02:50:33.700]  but super dank, like super dank, insanely loud. She just doesn't grow fast. She's just
[02:50:34.100 --> 02:50:38.340]  so freaking slow. I don't have her anymore. That's how slow she was. I just,
[02:50:39.140 --> 02:50:42.660]  I didn't feel comfortable selling her to anybody. I'm not going to have somebody put that in a
[02:50:42.660 --> 02:50:50.100]  commercial grow. I couldn't really justify continuing to grow her. I crossed her with,
[02:50:50.100 --> 02:51:00.180]  I crossed her with the creature and they were all runs and slow and small. So I, I just let
[02:51:00.180 --> 02:51:04.340]  that one go. Yeah. It does happen. Sometimes the small ones are crazy.
[02:51:06.500 --> 02:51:10.340]  Usually it's still not worth it though. Cause they're small and they grow slow vegetatively.
[02:51:10.340 --> 02:51:15.140]  I mean, that's not really a plant that most people can grow. If you have your own commercial
[02:51:15.140 --> 02:51:20.100]  setup and you have your own bedroom and you have the opportunity to grow some out longer,
[02:51:21.220 --> 02:51:26.100]  then, then it can, it can work. If you don't mind it taking nine months to veg when other plants
[02:51:26.100 --> 02:51:30.660]  are taking a month, once you put it in a flower, it's, it's going to act good in most cases.
[02:51:32.580 --> 02:51:38.420]  It may not have the big jump in vegetative growth during the first 10 days of flower or 15 days of
[02:51:38.420 --> 02:51:43.620]  flower. But if you put her in a pot by herself under a light with other girls that are all her
[02:51:43.620 --> 02:51:49.220]  sisters, and then it could work out. But again, this is something that a hobbyist grower would
[02:51:49.220 --> 02:51:53.380]  be doing for, for the love of the plant. This is not something a commercial grower would really
[02:51:53.380 --> 02:52:01.980]  want to do. Okay. Boom, fire, red dirt. This is my family right here. This guy is a great
[02:52:01.980 --> 02:52:09.580]  grower out here in Oklahoma. He does, he does a lot of work with our strains. The Gucci fruit he
[02:52:09.580 --> 02:52:18.620]  grew was absolutely insane. The Gucci fruit is an all out hog. I had that. Yup. Yeah. She's a hog.
[02:52:18.620 --> 02:52:25.580]  Feed her bro. Feed her. Don't be scared. She's never heard about me. She's never even burnt on
[02:52:25.580 --> 02:52:31.020]  me. I've taken her up to 1800 PPM. She loves it. She needs it. She wants it. You got to give it to
[02:52:31.020 --> 02:52:39.420]  her. Yup. Red dirt. I'd give her everything you can bro. Nice. Shout out red. Appreciate you
[02:52:39.500 --> 02:52:51.700]  stopping by. Okay. Green's goddess. What are my views on compost versus compost tea?
[02:52:55.840 --> 02:53:01.280]  For, I mean, this is going to be commercial centric because that's where I'm at. You know,
[02:53:01.280 --> 02:53:08.720]  for me, I'm running a business. So I mean, a compost tea would work well for me,
[02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:14.640]  a compost, you know, top dressing, I guess you're talking about on, on a bed or something for me,
[02:53:14.640 --> 02:53:19.680]  really, or mixing it into the soil that really wouldn't work. Cause I like that bank blank slate.
[02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:25.120]  I really want that blank slate and I'm willing to sacrifice the natural things that I may not
[02:53:25.120 --> 02:53:30.400]  understand about a living soil to, to attain that. And I think I'm taking some parts of that living
[02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:35.520]  soil philosophy with the organic and vegan and follow nutrients. It just wouldn't really work
[02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:41.200]  for me. I like that blank slate. I think it's smart if you're doing a living, living soil and
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:47.040]  you're reusing your bed. So of course I think compost that's properly handled and composted
[02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:52.400]  would be amazing. The tea, you know, obviously the major difference is if you're making a tea,
[02:53:52.400 --> 02:53:56.880]  you're going to get a more immediate reaction. The plants are going to be able to uptake that. Now,
[02:53:57.600 --> 02:54:01.360]  you know, if you're putting compost on the soil or mixing it in and watering it,
[02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:06.800]  it's going to be a slower dispersal. So I think, again, it kind of depends on what your goal is.
[02:54:06.800 --> 02:54:13.520]  If you want to use water all year, I would say load your soil up with some compost.
[02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:19.440]  If you're going to be doing nutrient additions to your soil throughout the growing process,
[02:54:19.440 --> 02:54:21.280]  then I think the compost tea would be a better choice.
[02:54:30.010 --> 02:54:35.130]  All right. Any other questions? We can probably do some house.
[02:54:35.130 --> 02:54:35.770]  This has been fun.
[02:54:35.770 --> 02:54:36.890]  Clean the house.
[02:54:36.890 --> 02:54:39.450]  Yeah, man, we really appreciate your candid answers as well.
[02:54:41.050 --> 02:54:44.250]  Like I mentioned, man, some people answer them and then some people really
[02:54:44.250 --> 02:54:45.450]  take the time to answer them.
[02:54:46.570 --> 02:54:49.290]  Yeah, this man is honest right here. Much respect.
[02:54:49.850 --> 02:54:50.970]  Love, love, love.
[02:54:50.970 --> 02:54:56.090]  Definitely. And I always, I always say I love language and I love the way that people use it.
[02:54:56.090 --> 02:55:02.010]  And it tells you about a person a lot of times, you know, call it what it is. I feel on a higher
[02:55:02.010 --> 02:55:08.010]  vibrational plane after all of this. I know you use the word day. I know you use the word month,
[02:55:08.010 --> 02:55:10.490]  but I love how you've replaced strong for weak.
[02:55:12.010 --> 02:55:13.690]  And I caught that throughout the interview.
[02:55:13.690 --> 02:55:15.290]  So I'm glad you caught that.
[02:55:15.290 --> 02:55:16.810]  Yeah, that's excellent.
[02:55:18.250 --> 02:55:20.490]  Yeah, we speak in strength, Rasta.
[02:55:20.490 --> 02:55:25.290]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. And we do have a little bit of house cleaning real quick.
[02:55:25.290 --> 02:55:28.730]  I will be back here tonight in three hours, seven o'clock.
[02:55:29.210 --> 02:55:34.330]  A special presentation from Steve Reisner, Potent Ponics.
[02:55:34.330 --> 02:55:38.410]  I've asked him to come through and break down aquaponics
[02:55:38.410 --> 02:55:41.530]  for somebody who might be new to that type of system.
[02:55:41.530 --> 02:55:44.570]  So he's going to explain how it works, how it could benefit you.
[02:55:45.210 --> 02:55:47.850]  Seven o'clock tonight on FCP02.
[02:55:47.850 --> 02:55:49.050]  We'll be over there tonight.
[02:55:49.050 --> 02:55:52.730]  And that's seven o'clock on the West Coast, 10 on the East Coast.
[02:55:52.730 --> 02:55:55.370]  But that's it for me.
[02:55:55.450 --> 02:55:58.010]  You guys, please definitely give yourself shout outs
[02:55:58.010 --> 02:55:59.930]  and where people can find you again.
[02:55:59.930 --> 02:56:02.250]  It's been a pleasure hanging out with you guys today.
[02:56:03.130 --> 02:56:05.530]  Awesome, Chad. Love and respect, Reverend.
[02:56:05.530 --> 02:56:06.250]  Yeah, thanks, Chad.
[02:56:06.810 --> 02:56:09.290]  Yeah, behind the scenes, man. We always appreciate you, buddy.
[02:56:10.090 --> 02:56:12.570]  Well, I'll go first. We'll let Brian close it out.
[02:56:13.290 --> 02:56:15.210]  Belief, appreciate you, man.
[02:56:16.010 --> 02:56:19.050]  Once again, as soon as I saw what you were doing,
[02:56:20.090 --> 02:56:23.610]  it didn't take much for me to know that you were doing it very well.
[02:56:23.610 --> 02:56:26.330]  And now after hearing you talk, I love it.
[02:56:26.330 --> 02:56:29.290]  I can tell you're a man of your numbers.
[02:56:29.290 --> 02:56:31.210]  You've got to be very meticulous.
[02:56:32.810 --> 02:56:34.250]  Thank you for sharing all this.
[02:56:34.250 --> 02:56:40.410]  And man, just looking forward to continuing to dialogue with you
[02:56:40.410 --> 02:56:44.490]  and much respect and luck with your growth, brother.
[02:56:44.490 --> 02:56:45.770]  Yeah, man. Love and honor, brother.
[02:56:46.730 --> 02:56:48.010]  Sounds good. Sounds good.
[02:56:48.010 --> 02:56:48.570]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:48.570 --> 02:56:53.290]  So again, if anybody wants to hit me up for anything they need,

[02:57:41.930 --> 02:57:44.250]  We're going to have building after building.
[02:57:44.250 --> 02:57:46.250]  We're going to do all kinds of fun stuff.
[02:57:46.250 --> 02:57:49.370]  Open cullination runs as well,
[02:57:49.370 --> 02:57:52.890]  where I'm just going to put 30 or 40 of my favorite girls in a room
[02:57:52.890 --> 02:57:56.970]  and spray half of every plant with spray and have them reverse.
[02:57:56.970 --> 02:58:00.330]  And I'm just going to drop those seeds for a ridiculously low price
[02:58:00.330 --> 02:58:04.570]  and just give everybody a chance to find absolutely new cool stuff.
[02:58:05.690 --> 02:58:08.170]  So yeah, we got a lot of really exciting stuff coming.
[02:58:10.090 --> 02:58:11.690]  You can't really see the website up here,
[02:58:12.410 --> 02:58:16.490]  but if you go to my email or the Instagrams,
[02:58:16.490 --> 02:58:18.170]  you can link into there.
[02:58:18.170 --> 02:58:22.330]  Shows you more pictures and descriptions about our products and stuff.
[02:58:22.330 --> 02:58:28.410]  We got some fire shirts and different gear and stuff that we produce as well.
[02:58:28.410 --> 02:58:29.530]  So it's all love family.
[02:58:29.530 --> 02:58:31.050]  We appreciate the support.
[02:58:31.050 --> 02:58:33.210]  And if you have any questions whatsoever, just hit us up.
[02:58:33.210 --> 02:58:33.930]  We'll get back to you.
[02:58:35.610 --> 02:58:36.090]  Yeah, man.
[02:58:36.090 --> 02:58:41.050]  And this is, you know, again, this is the platform that we hope we can continue to push out.
[02:58:41.050 --> 02:58:45.450]  So shout out to Peter for allowing us, you know, the second show, if you will,
[02:58:45.450 --> 02:58:49.290]  that we can continue to educate and keep it where, you know,
[02:58:49.290 --> 02:58:51.370]  we're not influenced by anybody.
[02:58:51.370 --> 02:58:55.770]  We're all doing this on our own time and our own dime as I've learned to say.
[02:58:55.770 --> 02:58:59.290]  So shout out to everybody that is rocking with us,
[02:58:59.290 --> 02:59:02.410]  because I feel like this is something that we can continue to walk down.
[02:59:03.130 --> 02:59:06.570]  Like I had mentioned, Marco and I want to dive deeper into this stuff.
[02:59:06.570 --> 02:59:08.810]  It doesn't necessarily always have to be with growing.
[02:59:08.810 --> 02:59:12.410]  So, you know, keep your eye open to a lot of different,
[02:59:12.410 --> 02:59:14.250]  almost like show varieties and stuff.
[02:59:14.250 --> 02:59:17.450]  And if you guys have some ideas of your own, please hit us up with that.
[02:59:18.170 --> 02:59:20.010]  Again, the way that we're doing this is
[02:59:21.050 --> 02:59:24.650]  microbes by Marco and rubberduckyisopods.com.
[02:59:24.650 --> 02:59:28.490]  That is how we are taking care of ourselves, hustling and taking care of our families.
[02:59:28.490 --> 02:59:29.850]  So please support us in that way.
[02:59:30.490 --> 02:59:33.210]  Tomorrow I'm with Peter and Leighton Morrison.
[02:59:33.210 --> 02:59:36.170]  So shout out to those guys continuing to really build the platform,
[02:59:36.170 --> 02:59:38.810]  which is known as the Future Cannabis Project.
[02:59:38.810 --> 02:59:41.530]  I feel like just seeing the fact that it's grown from
[02:59:42.250 --> 02:59:47.130]  last year around COVID time, 30,000 to over 60,000 in one year is just fantastic.
[02:59:47.690 --> 02:59:49.930]  The amount of education that's getting out there.
[02:59:49.930 --> 02:59:54.410]  I see a lot of videos, people giving us shout outs and stuff, little snippets and stuff.
[02:59:54.410 --> 02:59:57.610]  So just shout out to everybody that is continuing to support this.
[02:59:57.610 --> 03:00:01.130]  And all we ask is that if you like it, please smash the like button.
[03:00:01.130 --> 03:00:04.490]  I don't think you realize how important that is to Google,
[03:00:04.490 --> 03:00:07.050]  to Peter's show and to everybody involved.
[03:00:07.050 --> 03:00:10.650]  So if you do appreciate that, and if you don't like it,
[03:00:10.650 --> 03:00:14.170]  then also you can smash the thumbs down button.
[03:00:14.250 --> 03:00:18.730]  We just would like to really continue to improve our shows and show you guys that
[03:00:18.730 --> 03:00:22.410]  education is really what it's going to take to get to the next level.
[03:00:22.410 --> 03:00:26.890]  And Be Leaf has obviously proven today what it's going to take for you guys to get there.
[03:00:26.890 --> 03:00:28.810]  And I hope a lot of you are on that journey.
[03:00:28.810 --> 03:00:30.730]  So I appreciate everybody.
[03:00:30.730 --> 03:00:33.850]  Shout out to Jethouse Gardens tomorrow with Peter and Leighton.
[03:00:37.580 --> 03:00:39.260]  Anything else from you, Chad?
[03:00:42.300 --> 03:00:43.020]  You're muted, buddy.
[03:00:43.100 --> 03:00:45.100]  I do that at times.
[03:00:45.820 --> 03:00:46.300]  Thank you.
[03:00:47.340 --> 03:00:51.420]  If you guys like, you can find me Chad.Westport on Instagram
[03:00:51.420 --> 03:00:53.420]  and find me on the Future Cannabis Project.
[03:00:53.420 --> 03:00:56.460]  So thank you guys for letting me be a part of this today.
[03:00:56.460 --> 03:00:57.500]  I appreciate it.
[03:00:57.500 --> 03:00:58.300]  Yes, sir.
[03:00:58.300 --> 03:00:58.780]  Yeah.
[03:00:58.780 --> 03:00:59.340]  All right.
[03:00:59.340 --> 03:01:01.500]  Now we'll go ahead and end this show.
[03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:03.340]  So peace out, everybody.
