[00:02.040 --> 00:07.400]  Welcome, everyone, episode 11 of the James Loud Show.
[00:07.400 --> 00:10.880]  Here is your host, the Mr. James Loud.
[00:10.880 --> 00:13.080]  Hey, what's going on, everyone?
[00:13.080 --> 00:14.480]  How you doing?
[00:14.480 --> 00:15.480]  Welcome to week 11.
[00:15.480 --> 00:22.120]  I got Master Yoda on the show, who I've been friends with for a really long time.
[00:22.120 --> 00:27.280]  We came up in the Cannabis Cup scene together, and welcome to the show.
[00:27.280 --> 00:28.280]  Welcome.
[00:28.280 --> 00:29.280]  Thanks for having me, brother.
[00:29.280 --> 00:30.280]  We're actually in the same room.
[00:30.280 --> 00:34.400]  This is the first time I've done this since the whole COVID thing with the same room.
[00:34.400 --> 00:35.400]  It's great.
[00:35.400 --> 00:39.840]  He came up here, and we've been discussing some business opportunities and some fun stuff.
[00:39.840 --> 00:40.840]  How you doing today?
[00:40.840 --> 00:41.840]  I'm blessed.
[00:41.840 --> 00:42.840]  Blessed to be here.
[00:42.840 --> 00:45.160]  Blessed to have the opportunity to be here with you again.
[00:45.160 --> 00:47.360]  It's been a long time.
[00:47.360 --> 00:53.440]  Just happy to come and discuss some bigger projects that are beyond us, and hopefully
[00:53.440 --> 00:56.040]  we can get them going and get things going for the people.
[00:56.040 --> 00:57.040]  It'd be great.
[00:57.040 --> 00:58.040]  For sure.
[00:58.080 --> 00:59.080]  Fantastic.
[00:59.080 --> 01:03.080]  Tell me a little bit about your history with cannabis.
[01:03.080 --> 01:05.080]  How long you've been in the industry?
[01:05.080 --> 01:12.280]  I know you went to Oaks University back in the day when we had medical long before this
[01:12.280 --> 01:13.280]  recreational stuff.
[01:13.280 --> 01:16.280]  I've been in the industry before medical.
[01:16.280 --> 01:22.280]  I've always been an activist for cannabis.
[01:22.520 --> 01:29.520]  When the medical thing kicked in, it was just my mission in life.
[01:29.520 --> 01:32.520]  I had to get it done no matter what.
[01:32.520 --> 01:37.520]  I just put my foot on the gas pedal and went full board on it.
[01:37.520 --> 01:40.520]  I was a union carpenter for a while.
[01:40.520 --> 01:44.520]  I let that job go just to pursue my dream with the cannabis industry.
[01:44.760 --> 01:52.760]  I had a shop at 420 West Pico across from the Staples Center back in 2009.
[01:52.760 --> 01:54.760]  I had gotten the location there.
[01:54.760 --> 01:56.760]  It was all operating under medical.
[01:56.760 --> 01:58.760]  We had a grill right there in downtown.
[01:58.760 --> 02:05.760]  It was unbelievable to see that goodness unravel, especially in a major city like that, being
[02:05.760 --> 02:09.760]  accepted and having all the people just walking in the streets.
[02:09.760 --> 02:11.760]  It was great to see that.
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  Winning the cup there in 2012, that was like a big crossroads for me.
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  Just being able to get my cup in the street, holding it up with everybody in the alley
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  streets, seeing the buildings behind me.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  It was just like history taking place.
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  I've just been an advocate for a long time.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  It's just a great thing.
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.000]  I believe in the plant.
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  I'm here to move it forward any means necessary.
[02:35.240 --> 02:38.240]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:38.240 --> 02:42.240]  Tell us a little bit about Oaksterdam in the beginning.
[02:42.240 --> 02:49.240]  I think Oaksterdam was the first school for cannabis anywhere, at least in my knowledge.
[02:49.240 --> 02:51.240]  I guess they had the Cannabis College in Amsterdam.
[02:51.240 --> 02:53.240]  That was probably earlier.
[02:53.240 --> 02:55.240]  As far as the United States, Oaksterdam was it.
[02:55.240 --> 03:01.240]  It was the one place you could go to for college level education as much as there was.
[03:01.480 --> 03:04.480]  OCBC picked up clones right there.
[03:04.480 --> 03:08.480]  The dispensary started right here in San Francisco, Oakland and all that.
[03:08.480 --> 03:11.480]  I was coming up here to get clones from Oaksterdam.
[03:11.480 --> 03:15.480]  They had the dispensary upstairs.
[03:15.480 --> 03:21.480]  We'd just drive out here, get our little bit of plants and work on our little projects.
[03:21.480 --> 03:23.480]  That's how it started.
[03:23.480 --> 03:25.480]  It started moving down south a little bit.
[03:25.720 --> 03:29.720]  I put my ear to the ground, was receptive to things.
[03:29.720 --> 03:32.720]  I just put the work in to get established in downtown.
[03:32.720 --> 03:35.720]  There was a lot of work.
[03:35.720 --> 03:36.720]  I did it for a few years.
[03:36.720 --> 03:39.720]  Then a lot started changing.
[03:39.720 --> 03:41.720]  I tried to do the transition to recreation.
[03:41.720 --> 03:46.720]  I had to walk away from three or four different legitimate businesses.
[03:46.720 --> 03:48.720]  It wasn't in my best interest at the time.
[03:48.720 --> 03:50.720]  I just walked away.
[03:50.720 --> 03:52.720]  I'm just doing a couple of little things right now.
[03:52.960 --> 03:53.960]  Everything's good.
[03:53.960 --> 03:55.960]  Just waiting for the right opportunity to come in.
[03:58.960 --> 03:59.960]  Awesome.
[03:59.960 --> 04:01.960]  Augie is tuned in now.
[04:01.960 --> 04:03.960]  We got Augie Glass from Instagram.
[04:03.960 --> 04:05.960]  How you doing, guys?
[04:05.960 --> 04:06.960]  Can you hear me?
[04:06.960 --> 04:07.960]  We can hear you.
[04:07.960 --> 04:08.960]  You're good.
[04:08.960 --> 04:09.960]  Yeah.
[04:09.960 --> 04:10.960]  Nice, nice.
[04:10.960 --> 04:11.960]  Finally.
[04:11.960 --> 04:12.960]  I've known Augie.
[04:12.960 --> 04:15.960]  He worked with Silica for a long time.
[04:15.960 --> 04:20.960]  We won a cup with Silica Glass that Augie made the glass for in 2013 at the High Times
[04:21.200 --> 04:22.200]  Cup in Amsterdam.
[04:23.200 --> 04:26.200]  He's a glass guy on the LA scene.
[04:26.200 --> 04:29.200]  He's always been creative and innovative with glass doing his thing.
[04:29.200 --> 04:32.200]  How you doing, Augie?
[04:32.200 --> 04:33.200]  I'm doing well.
[04:33.200 --> 04:34.200]  I'm excited.
[04:34.200 --> 04:37.200]  I finally got my little studio going on.
[04:39.200 --> 04:40.200]  I'm just looking forward.
[04:40.200 --> 04:45.200]  I'm just keeping doing what I'm doing with the glass industry and all the cannabis.
[04:48.200 --> 04:50.200]  How has COVID been for you?
[04:50.440 --> 04:52.440]  Everything's going well.
[04:52.440 --> 04:53.440]  Yeah.
[04:53.440 --> 04:54.440]  Excited.
[04:54.440 --> 04:57.440]  I mean, always looking forward.
[04:57.440 --> 04:58.440]  But yeah.
[04:58.440 --> 05:00.440]  Doing good.
[05:00.440 --> 05:02.440]  How about everything else?
[05:02.440 --> 05:05.440]  Sorry, I'm kind of new with this thing.
[05:05.440 --> 05:08.440]  But yeah, nervous too.
[05:08.440 --> 05:09.440]  I see you.
[05:11.440 --> 05:13.440]  You're in a safe space.
[05:13.440 --> 05:14.440]  Right.
[05:14.440 --> 05:15.440]  Yeah.
[05:15.440 --> 05:16.440]  Perfect.
[05:16.440 --> 05:17.440]  So you got a new studio.
[05:17.680 --> 05:20.680]  Where are you guys located now?
[05:20.680 --> 05:21.680]  San Fernando.
[05:21.680 --> 05:24.680]  Oh, so you're back in San Fernando.
[05:24.680 --> 05:25.680]  Yeah.
[05:25.680 --> 05:26.680]  Not too far away.
[05:26.680 --> 05:27.680]  Awesome.
[05:27.680 --> 05:28.680]  Yep.
[05:28.680 --> 05:29.680]  Good stuff.
[05:29.680 --> 05:34.680]  So as far as cup winners, I'm sure you've seen a ton of different cup winners in the
[05:34.680 --> 05:35.680]  piece that you did.
[05:36.680 --> 05:40.680]  What do you think stands out for glass as far as people that are trying to win cups
[05:40.680 --> 05:42.680]  with their glass designs?
[05:42.920 --> 05:49.920]  Well, I mean, it's really tough, you know, because there's a lot of really good glass
[05:49.920 --> 05:57.920]  brewers out there, you know, but I mean, everybody tries to do the best in the industry and try
[05:57.920 --> 06:06.920]  to get it out there so people can actually see the glass industry, you know.
[06:07.920 --> 06:10.920]  But yeah, I mean, yeah, it's pretty much that.
[06:11.160 --> 06:15.160]  Yeah, I think the glass is like a whole subculture.
[06:16.160 --> 06:18.160]  And cannabis is a subculture.
[06:18.160 --> 06:21.160]  And then on that subculture, there's a whole glass subculture.
[06:21.160 --> 06:26.160]  And, you know, even within smaller groups of that subculture, we have like the dab rigs
[06:26.160 --> 06:31.160]  that there's a select group of people, you know, a handful of people that love spending
[06:31.160 --> 06:32.160]  money on glass rigs.
[06:32.160 --> 06:35.160]  You see them going up to like 30, 40,000.
[06:35.160 --> 06:39.160]  I see these kids at cups walking around with their glass.
[06:39.160 --> 06:40.160]  They got $40,000 glass piece.
[06:40.400 --> 06:41.400]  They don't even own a car.
[06:42.400 --> 06:43.400]  Yeah, literally.
[06:43.400 --> 06:44.400]  Yes, yes, yes.
[06:44.400 --> 06:49.400]  This is like a trend, you know, like I think the glass industry changed so fast.
[06:50.400 --> 06:56.400]  And so, I mean, in a good way, I think so fast and so like trendy, you know, like popular,
[06:56.400 --> 07:01.400]  like people really want to get it, you know, from the people like, you know, they really
[07:01.400 --> 07:05.400]  start collecting glass and they don't really care how much money they spend on glass, you
[07:05.400 --> 07:06.400]  know?
[07:06.400 --> 07:07.400]  Yeah.
[07:07.640 --> 07:08.640]  Yeah.
[07:09.640 --> 07:10.640]  Yeah.
[07:10.640 --> 07:11.640]  So, do you have any pieces to show us today?
[07:11.640 --> 07:12.640]  Yeah, I do have a couple of them.
[07:12.640 --> 07:13.640]  Yeah, for sure.
[07:13.640 --> 07:14.640]  Awesome.
[07:15.640 --> 07:17.640]  And can you flip your camera 90 degrees like a TV?
[07:18.640 --> 07:21.640]  Yeah, that's what I was thinking, where I could do that.
[07:22.640 --> 07:23.640]  Hmm.
[07:23.640 --> 07:24.640]  Where I could do that.
[07:24.640 --> 07:25.640]  Just right there?
[07:26.640 --> 07:27.640]  Right there?
[07:27.640 --> 07:28.640]  No, right?
[07:28.640 --> 07:29.640]  No, I could close it.
[07:29.640 --> 07:30.640]  My bad.
[07:30.640 --> 07:34.640]  Well, I mean, just a little bit of prep right here.
[07:34.880 --> 07:41.880]  So, can you flip your camera 90 degrees like you're holding it like this, turn it like
[07:41.880 --> 07:42.880]  that?
[07:42.880 --> 07:43.880]  Oh, okay.
[07:43.880 --> 07:44.880]  Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
[07:44.880 --> 07:45.880]  Like that?
[07:45.880 --> 07:46.880]  Yeah.
[07:46.880 --> 07:47.880]  Yeah.
[07:47.880 --> 07:48.880]  Oh, yeah.
[07:49.880 --> 07:51.880]  I got a little bit of prep right there.
[07:53.880 --> 07:55.880]  I got some more right here.
[07:58.600 --> 07:59.600]  Damn it.
[08:00.600 --> 08:02.600]  I got this is for you.
[08:02.600 --> 08:03.600]  That's the one for you.
[08:03.600 --> 08:04.600]  Thanks.
[08:04.840 --> 08:05.840]  Nice.
[08:06.840 --> 08:08.840]  Yeah, that's for James right there.
[08:08.840 --> 08:09.840]  You ordered it.
[08:10.840 --> 08:11.840]  Oh, shit.
[08:11.840 --> 08:12.840]  A little tricky right there.
[08:13.840 --> 08:15.840]  Yeah, a little flower piece.
[08:18.840 --> 08:19.840]  I got some more right there.
[08:20.840 --> 08:21.840]  You're going to show those?
[08:22.840 --> 08:24.840]  Those are costume piece that I used to make.
[08:24.840 --> 08:25.840]  Oh, yeah.
[08:27.840 --> 08:28.840]  Right there.
[08:31.840 --> 08:32.840]  Man, you're right.
[08:33.080 --> 08:39.080]  And who were some of your influences like when you were learning?
[08:40.080 --> 08:41.080]  Oh, shoot.
[08:43.080 --> 08:51.080]  It was more like known people, you know, like people that really like already know the industry
[08:52.080 --> 08:56.080]  kind of pushed me to do new stuff and get really into it, you know.
[08:58.080 --> 09:01.080]  Start making some costume pieces, I think, you know.
[09:01.320 --> 09:02.320]  But, yeah.
[09:05.320 --> 09:07.320]  Yeah, Silica was a big game changer, I think, for you.
[09:08.320 --> 09:13.320]  Working with Donnie and Donnie and Fish and those guys back in the day.
[09:13.320 --> 09:14.320]  Yeah.
[09:16.320 --> 09:19.320]  Yeah, I mean, I got some pieces to show you guys too that Augie's made me.
[09:20.320 --> 09:21.320]  We got this rig right here.
[09:22.320 --> 09:23.320]  Absolutely amazing.
[09:25.320 --> 09:26.320]  I got it.
[09:26.320 --> 09:27.320]  This isn't the cup that we went with.
[09:27.320 --> 09:29.320]  This is the Amsterdam Cup I won in 2012.
[09:29.560 --> 09:32.560]  But this is another rig he's made.
[09:33.560 --> 09:34.560]  I love these pieces.
[09:34.560 --> 09:35.560]  They hit really well.
[09:36.560 --> 09:37.560]  Thank you.
[09:37.560 --> 09:38.560]  Thank you.
[09:39.560 --> 09:40.560]  Yeah, custom and quality.
[09:40.560 --> 09:41.560]  And here's one with his logo from Silica.
[09:42.560 --> 09:43.560]  This is an old flashback.
[09:44.560 --> 09:45.560]  Oh, shoot.
[09:45.560 --> 09:46.560]  You still have that one.
[09:46.560 --> 09:47.560]  Yeah, I still got this piece, man.
[09:47.560 --> 09:48.560]  Yeah.
[09:49.560 --> 09:50.560]  Yeah, good stuff.
[09:54.560 --> 09:58.560]  And then so Augie and I have been, I commissioned Augie to do some pieces for me.
[09:58.800 --> 10:01.800]  So he's working on those about to knock them out soon, I hope.
[10:01.800 --> 10:02.800]  Yeah, I will.
[10:02.800 --> 10:04.800]  I'll show you the one that I have right there.
[10:04.800 --> 10:05.800]  Your flower piece is ready.
[10:05.800 --> 10:06.800]  Nice.
[10:06.800 --> 10:07.800]  I'm excited.
[10:07.800 --> 10:08.800]  I mean, hopefully I can send it out next week.
[10:09.800 --> 10:10.800]  Awesome.
[10:10.800 --> 10:14.800]  Yeah, but yeah, I will start working as soon as I can with the rest of the stuff.
[10:14.800 --> 10:16.800]  But yeah, looking forward to it.
[10:17.800 --> 10:18.800]  Just pretty busy too.
[10:19.800 --> 10:20.800]  Yeah, I know.
[10:20.800 --> 10:21.800]  I feel you.
[10:21.800 --> 10:23.800]  I'm glad you got your studio and that's getting up and going.
[10:24.800 --> 10:25.800]  Yeah.
[10:25.800 --> 10:26.800]  Yeah.
[10:26.800 --> 10:27.800]  Good things.
[10:28.040 --> 10:29.040]  Yeah, I'm excited to see what's coming here.
[10:30.040 --> 10:32.040]  Yeah, so as far as the glass scene, what do you feel?
[10:32.040 --> 10:34.040]  And Alfred, you probably touched it.
[10:34.040 --> 10:35.040]  Master Yoda can touch in on that.
[10:36.040 --> 10:40.040]  The glass scene from what it was like three or four years ago and then kind of before
[10:41.040 --> 10:42.040]  to where it's going in the future.
[10:44.040 --> 10:45.040]  What do you think, Augie?
[10:46.040 --> 10:47.040]  You think the direction it's going?
[10:48.040 --> 10:49.040]  I think it's changed.
[10:49.040 --> 10:50.040]  The colors have changed.
[10:50.040 --> 10:51.040]  The styles have changed.
[10:52.040 --> 10:53.040]  You know what?
[10:53.280 --> 11:02.280]  Well, just go back to 2013, 2010, you know, compared to what a glass rig was way back
[11:03.280 --> 11:04.280]  then to what it is right now.
[11:05.280 --> 11:12.280]  You can see like way, way many things, way many ways to do color, any styles and anything.
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.280]  You know, like the game is changing really fast in a good way, you know, but I think
[11:19.280 --> 11:20.280]  it's always looking forward.
[11:21.280 --> 11:22.280]  I mean, you know, it's going to get better and better.
[11:22.520 --> 11:24.520]  I don't think it's going to go the other way around, I guess.
[11:25.520 --> 11:26.520]  Yeah.
[11:27.520 --> 11:32.520]  Yeah, I think like even like this piece, for instance, you're using a lot of color in there,
[11:33.520 --> 11:37.520]  a lot of color and then the iridescence and stuff like that going well.
[11:38.520 --> 11:39.520]  Yeah, that's a really nice piece.
[11:40.520 --> 11:41.520]  Yeah, I love that piece.
[11:42.520 --> 11:43.520]  You should try that.
[11:44.520 --> 11:45.520]  Yeah.
[11:45.520 --> 11:46.520]  And then Master Yoda, he's a glass connoisseur.
[11:47.520 --> 11:48.520]  He's one of those guys.
[11:49.520 --> 11:50.520]  The first time I hit a Joel Peters.
[11:50.760 --> 11:53.760]  Yeah, it was 2013 at the High Times Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam.
[11:54.760 --> 11:58.760]  I took Joel's pieces out there and elbows and coils.
[11:59.760 --> 12:02.760]  They were all the collaboration pieces that they did with Joe.
[12:03.760 --> 12:04.760]  Oh, yeah.
[12:05.760 --> 12:06.760]  The honey drip pieces.
[12:07.760 --> 12:10.760]  And I actually won the cup in 2013 in Amsterdam for, I took all their pieces, like Joe won
[12:11.760 --> 12:12.760]  all their stuff, you know, I just was the best to take their stuff.
[12:13.760 --> 12:14.760]  And it was amazing.
[12:15.760 --> 12:16.760]  He was amazing for his time.
[12:17.760 --> 12:18.760]  He's still super amazing.
[12:19.000 --> 12:20.000]  For sure.
[12:21.000 --> 12:22.000]  Yeah.
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.000]  To me, that's my opinion.
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.000]  But a lot of people think that.
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.000]  Yeah, 100 percent.
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  I agree.
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.000]  And he's just so creative with the animals, you know, and just the way the ways they hit
[12:31.000 --> 12:32.000]  to all his pieces hit.
[12:33.000 --> 12:34.000]  They flow.
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  Absolutely.
[12:37.000 --> 12:38.000]  There's just something special about his style.
[12:39.000 --> 12:40.000]  If I would have known ahead of time, I would have brought him, but this is our last minute.
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.000]  I would have brought him and we would have showed him again.
[12:43.000 --> 12:44.000]  I still got him in the case right there.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  So next time, next time we come up, I'll do something like that.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  It's all good.
[12:48.240 --> 12:49.240]  More than I do.
[12:50.240 --> 12:51.240]  You don't even remember.
[12:52.240 --> 12:53.240]  Yeah.
[12:54.240 --> 12:55.240]  Yeah.
[12:56.240 --> 12:57.240]  You know what?
[12:58.240 --> 12:59.240]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[13:00.240 --> 13:01.240]  I kind of I'm not collecting so much glass as I was before.
[13:02.240 --> 13:03.240]  You know what I mean?
[13:04.240 --> 13:05.240]  So I mean.
[13:06.240 --> 13:07.240]  But it seems around the same to be honest with you, give or take, you know what I mean?
[13:08.240 --> 13:09.240]  To be honest with you.
[13:10.240 --> 13:11.240]  Right.
[13:11.240 --> 13:12.240]  That's good.
[13:13.240 --> 13:14.240]  I probably have about I would say about 20 pieces.
[13:15.240 --> 13:16.240]  Yeah.
[13:16.480 --> 13:17.480]  You know, not all the highest end ones.
[13:18.480 --> 13:19.480]  You know what I mean?
[13:20.480 --> 13:21.480]  But, you know, sure.
[13:22.480 --> 13:23.480]  Right.
[13:24.480 --> 13:25.480]  All together, you know.
[13:26.480 --> 13:27.480]  Yeah.
[13:27.480 --> 13:28.480]  If you count pipes, I think I probably have like 75 or 80.
[13:29.480 --> 13:30.480]  Damn.
[13:31.480 --> 13:34.480]  But but yeah, with everything I have, you know, I got a ton of stuff like stuff that
[13:35.480 --> 13:36.480]  I got in the 90s that I don't even touch anymore.
[13:37.480 --> 13:38.480]  That just wow.
[13:39.480 --> 13:40.480]  That's crazy.
[13:41.480 --> 13:42.480]  Yeah.
[13:43.480 --> 13:44.480]  So, Augie, how can how can people get ahold of you if they want to get a hold of you for
[13:44.720 --> 13:45.720]  your glass?
[13:46.720 --> 13:47.720]  Well, I'm doing pretty good.
[13:48.720 --> 13:49.720]  I'm excited.
[13:49.720 --> 13:50.720]  You know, I'm really, really, really good doing right now on Instagram.
[13:51.720 --> 13:56.720]  So most of my customers or my stores or custom pieces go straight out to my
[13:57.720 --> 13:58.720]  Instagram directly more than anything else.
[13:59.720 --> 14:00.720]  Or people that like they're collecting my work.
[14:01.720 --> 14:04.720]  They always come back, you know, but Instagram is the best way to go.
[14:05.720 --> 14:06.720]  Awesome.
[14:07.720 --> 14:08.720]  Yeah.
[14:09.720 --> 14:10.720]  Good stuff, man.
[14:11.720 --> 14:12.720]  Well, thank you for coming on today.
[14:12.960 --> 14:13.960]  Thank you.
[14:14.960 --> 14:15.960]  I'm still kind of nervous.
[14:16.960 --> 14:17.960]  Thanks for inviting me.
[14:18.960 --> 14:19.960]  Thanks.
[14:20.960 --> 14:21.960]  Yeah.
[14:22.960 --> 14:23.960]  Yeah.
[14:23.960 --> 14:24.960]  We'll see you on, you know, get some pieces together and we'll kind of show them off and
[14:25.960 --> 14:26.960]  present them on the show.
[14:27.960 --> 14:28.960]  Yeah.
[14:28.960 --> 14:29.960]  I can be a little more prepared to it, too.
[14:30.960 --> 14:31.960]  Yeah.
[14:31.960 --> 14:32.960]  Excellent.
[14:32.960 --> 14:33.960]  Thank you.
[14:34.960 --> 14:35.960]  You're welcome.
[14:35.960 --> 14:36.960]  We'll talk to you soon.
[14:37.960 --> 14:38.960]  Have a great day.
[14:38.960 --> 14:39.960]  Thank you.
[14:40.960 --> 14:41.960]  So we're back to talking about Augie Kirsch is going to be the next subject.
[14:42.960 --> 14:45.960]  Just quickly, this is super trippy trying to get your audios.
[14:46.960 --> 14:57.960]  Can you both confirm that in your audio settings that the audio is like this, this thing and
[14:58.960 --> 14:59.960]  these?
[15:00.960 --> 15:01.960]  Because I think for both of you.
[15:02.960 --> 15:03.960]  OK.
[15:04.960 --> 15:05.960]  Because we're in the same room.
[15:06.960 --> 15:07.960]  So there's a little bit of a gap.
[15:08.960 --> 15:09.960]  People are like, it's weird.
[15:10.960 --> 15:11.960]  They both have the same Grateful Dead poster.
[15:12.960 --> 15:13.960]  So everybody bear with me.
[15:14.960 --> 15:17.960]  I'm going to try to technically produce the audio as best I can and go.
[15:18.960 --> 15:19.960]  Well, we can kind of help with the mute button as well.
[15:20.960 --> 15:21.960]  So Alfred's on mute.
[15:22.960 --> 15:25.960]  He could unmute it with if you just go right there and then click.
[15:26.960 --> 15:27.960]  OK.
[15:27.960 --> 15:28.960]  Unmute it when you want to talk.
[15:29.960 --> 15:30.960]  And then I'll unmute it when I want to talk.
[15:31.960 --> 15:32.960]  Easy audio.
[15:32.960 --> 15:33.960]  Perfect.
[15:34.960 --> 15:41.960]  So Master Yoda, he he's he's one of the pioneers as far as Augie is concerned.
[15:42.960 --> 15:47.960]  He was one of the first people, if not the first to have a cross that was his, which
[15:48.960 --> 15:55.960]  was the Master Yoda Kush, Master Yoda OG cup winning, you know, OG Kush by itself.
[15:56.960 --> 15:57.960]  There was one OG Kush a long time ago.
[15:58.960 --> 16:03.960]  That was it in L.A. that Josh D. kind of passed around and a handful of people.
[16:04.960 --> 16:05.960]  There was a guy named Mad Dog.
[16:06.960 --> 16:10.960]  We had the Mad Dog cut up in the bay floating around and we bought packs of Mad Dog OG,
[16:11.200 --> 16:12.200]  which was the first OG Kush.
[16:13.200 --> 16:16.200]  So tell us a little bit about OG Kush back in the day.
[16:17.200 --> 16:18.200]  You're you're beginning with OG Kush.
[16:19.200 --> 16:22.200]  What led you to working with it and kind of about the cultivar that you created?
[16:23.200 --> 16:26.200]  Well, back in the day, day one was that.
[16:27.200 --> 16:28.200]  Oh, let's see.
[16:31.200 --> 16:32.200]  When did the Kush come in?
[16:33.200 --> 16:34.200]  My goodness.
[16:35.200 --> 16:36.200]  I've been on the Kush now for about what?
[16:37.200 --> 16:38.200]  Oh, five.
[16:38.440 --> 16:39.440]  Oh, four.
[16:40.440 --> 16:41.440]  And it started with that Master Kush thing, too.
[16:42.440 --> 16:47.440]  Then I had a couple of the Master and the Joe, the OG Kush were out.
[16:48.440 --> 16:49.440]  And so was the Bubba.
[16:50.440 --> 16:51.440]  It was these three Kushes that everybody was on.
[16:52.440 --> 16:55.440]  You know what I went and did was the Master Kush and the OG Kush.
[16:56.440 --> 16:57.440]  Those were the ones that I bred together.
[16:58.440 --> 16:59.440]  You know what I mean?
[17:00.440 --> 17:01.440]  And that's how after Little Fino Hunt.
[17:02.440 --> 17:05.440]  I mean, what was what I was looking for was the sweetness.
[17:05.680 --> 17:08.680]  The legs on after you smoke it, it has to have the legs and the smell.
[17:09.680 --> 17:10.680]  Those were the things that stood out to me.
[17:11.680 --> 17:12.680]  So it wasn't necessarily the biggest yielder.
[17:13.680 --> 17:14.680]  And that even took.
[17:15.680 --> 17:19.680]  Took place on a decision on naming the strain because it had the legs.
[17:20.680 --> 17:21.680]  It had the taste.
[17:22.680 --> 17:23.680]  It had the smell.
[17:24.680 --> 17:27.680]  And like Yoda, it was he's it's not like I said, it didn't produce the biggest
[17:28.680 --> 17:29.680]  flowers, but they were small and powerful.
[17:30.680 --> 17:31.680]  And the little green guy is small and powerful.
[17:31.920 --> 17:34.920]  So it was just it was master dominant with the sweet.
[17:35.920 --> 17:36.920]  And it still had the OG properties.
[17:37.920 --> 17:40.920]  And look, so bringing it together, I gave it the master Yoda Kush name
[17:41.920 --> 17:42.920]  because it's master dominant.
[17:43.920 --> 17:45.920]  It's little nugs that represent the little green guy.
[17:46.920 --> 17:47.920]  And it's a good.
[17:48.920 --> 17:49.920]  So it just it kind of just flowed together.
[17:50.920 --> 17:51.920]  I was like, I didn't sign up for this.
[17:52.920 --> 17:53.920]  Is it the passion of it?
[17:54.920 --> 17:55.920]  Just doing it.
[17:56.920 --> 17:57.920]  It just it came together for me.
[17:58.920 --> 17:59.920]  And I was doing it.
[18:00.160 --> 18:01.160]  And I had that strain before we even opened the shop.
[18:02.160 --> 18:03.160]  You know what I mean?
[18:03.160 --> 18:06.160]  Then I opened the shop and that popularized me in downtown once I had
[18:07.160 --> 18:08.160]  the shot and we were doing it for a while.
[18:09.160 --> 18:12.160]  And I was unaware of the High Times Cup coming in in 2012.
[18:13.160 --> 18:15.160]  Someone had a what was his name?
[18:16.160 --> 18:17.160]  Aaron from Bowmole.
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.160]  He had just came from the Frisco Cup in 2011 and he went into my store
[18:23.160 --> 18:24.160]  and bought some of the Yoda.
[18:25.160 --> 18:26.160]  He left.
[18:27.160 --> 18:28.160]  He was gone for a couple hours and gave me a call.
[18:28.400 --> 18:30.400]  I just came from the Cup in San Francisco.
[18:31.400 --> 18:33.400]  And when you got there would be that.
[18:34.400 --> 18:35.400]  So it's like, why don't you get a booth with me?
[18:36.400 --> 18:39.400]  We'll share a booth and you can have your product there and enter the
[18:40.400 --> 18:41.400]  Cupware.
[18:42.400 --> 18:43.400]  Unknowingly, I mean, I was so passionate about what I was doing.
[18:44.400 --> 18:47.400]  I was very critical about what I wanted, what I was trying to develop.
[18:48.400 --> 18:49.400]  And.
[18:50.400 --> 18:53.400]  I already did those stages before I even opened the shop, so I was already
[18:54.400 --> 18:56.400]  working with the confidence, with the passion for the strain that we had
[18:56.640 --> 18:57.640]  right there.
[18:58.640 --> 18:59.640]  So it was really popular in L.A.
[19:00.640 --> 19:03.640]  I knew with two weeks in advance about the Cup and I entered it and.
[19:05.640 --> 19:09.640]  Just I'm blown away with what happened, you know, just passion driven,
[19:10.640 --> 19:13.640]  doing things with love, create something, you know, and it just you got
[19:14.640 --> 19:15.640]  to flip every stone.
[19:16.640 --> 19:17.640]  I flipped it.
[19:17.640 --> 19:18.640]  I entered the Cup and I won it.
[19:19.640 --> 19:20.640]  And that changed my life forever after that.
[19:21.640 --> 19:22.640]  After after that Cup, when going to San Francisco.
[19:23.640 --> 19:25.640]  For the following couple of those two, three months after that.
[19:26.640 --> 19:28.640]  After I won there, then in Washington, came back the following year.
[19:29.640 --> 19:30.640]  We won for hash and flour.
[19:31.640 --> 19:32.640]  It's like all in all, I got like 30 awards.
[19:33.640 --> 19:34.640]  I would say like.
[19:35.640 --> 19:38.640]  Twenty four of them are for Yoda flowers and different types of
[19:39.640 --> 19:40.640]  concentrates from the Yoda flower.
[19:41.640 --> 19:44.640]  And then I got a couple others from a couple other strains that I grew.
[19:45.640 --> 19:48.640]  I didn't create, but that I grew and entered in competitions and they
[19:49.640 --> 19:50.640]  still placed.
[19:51.640 --> 19:52.640]  But my main one was was the Yoda.
[19:53.640 --> 19:54.640]  And yeah, just.
[19:54.880 --> 19:56.880]  I'm really blessed and I'm excited to just keep pushing forward with
[19:57.880 --> 20:01.880]  everything and, you know, just just keep going to see how far these
[20:02.880 --> 20:03.880]  blessings go.
[20:04.880 --> 20:05.880]  Just put in the work, you know, that's it.
[20:06.880 --> 20:07.880]  Totally.
[20:08.880 --> 20:11.880]  So let's take it a step back further and talk about the master cush,
[20:12.880 --> 20:16.880]  because I feel like there's several phenotypes and several varieties
[20:17.880 --> 20:18.880]  that were out there.
[20:19.880 --> 20:20.880]  Yes.
[20:21.880 --> 20:22.880]  With that.
[20:23.120 --> 20:25.120]  The one that I remember the most was the one that it grew like a
[20:26.120 --> 20:27.120]  Christmas tree.
[20:28.120 --> 20:30.120]  So the calyx actually shot out of the sides and it was it wasn't an
[20:31.120 --> 20:34.120]  open bud structure, but it was more open than like OG cush.
[20:35.120 --> 20:36.120]  And it had like a sweet fuel to it.
[20:37.120 --> 20:38.120]  Right, right.
[20:39.120 --> 20:40.120]  I remember that one.
[20:42.120 --> 20:43.120]  I remember what you're talking about.
[20:44.120 --> 20:45.120]  I know the subtleties in the two.
[20:46.120 --> 20:49.120]  One was more spicy and one had more of a sweetness to it.
[20:49.360 --> 20:52.360]  The master that I had got and it didn't have the calyx like growing
[20:53.360 --> 20:54.360]  off the bud or nothing.
[20:55.360 --> 20:56.360]  It was more they were tighter, nice structure.
[20:57.360 --> 20:58.360]  You know what I mean?
[20:59.360 --> 21:00.360]  I mean, we could give the cut to a couple of different people and
[21:01.360 --> 21:02.360]  they're going to grow it differently a little bit.
[21:03.360 --> 21:04.360]  You know what I mean?
[21:04.360 --> 21:05.360]  So everybody has their little style of it.
[21:06.360 --> 21:07.360]  Some little properties will come out different.
[21:08.360 --> 21:09.360]  Just it's just the way it is.
[21:10.360 --> 21:11.360]  But.
[21:12.360 --> 21:14.360]  That particular master, like I said, it really, really stood out to me.
[21:15.360 --> 21:18.360]  It had the sweet properties high in limonene and not everything had that.
[21:19.360 --> 21:22.360]  I tripped out on that subtlety, but I was an OG connoisseur still.
[21:23.360 --> 21:24.360]  You know what I mean?
[21:25.360 --> 21:29.360]  But having the two, I experimented and this beautiful thing came out.
[21:30.360 --> 21:31.360]  So I just ran with it.
[21:32.360 --> 21:33.360]  You know, just ran with it.
[21:34.360 --> 21:35.360]  It took over the whole.
[21:36.360 --> 21:38.360]  Just everything I was I was humbled by it.
[21:39.360 --> 21:40.360]  You know, it really pleased my palate.
[21:41.360 --> 21:42.360]  I was satisfied with the taste.
[21:43.360 --> 21:46.360]  It was like I was on it on a connoisseur tip, not on mass production
[21:47.360 --> 21:48.360]  and making the money.
[21:48.600 --> 21:50.600]  We didn't have the shot, but I just wanted to smoke some of the best
[21:51.600 --> 21:54.600]  that we could possibly have, you know, and I'm still looking for it.
[21:55.600 --> 21:57.600]  Looking for the next best, you know, so.
[21:58.600 --> 21:59.600]  That's good, though.
[22:01.600 --> 22:06.600]  Yeah, so in 2012, you know, I'd witnessed you winning some cups
[22:07.600 --> 22:08.600]  and we'd been friends before I won.
[22:09.600 --> 22:12.600]  And then when I won in 2012, you were one of the people
[22:13.600 --> 22:15.600]  you're standing with Danny Danko backstage.
[22:15.840 --> 22:16.840]  When I got off the stage, you gave me a hug.
[22:17.840 --> 22:18.840]  You congratulated me.
[22:19.840 --> 22:22.840]  And then we started talking in depth, you know, in the excitement.
[22:23.840 --> 22:26.840]  And we were talking about you use the term any given Sunday
[22:27.840 --> 22:28.840]  about about winning a cup.
[22:29.840 --> 22:31.840]  And that's really resonated with me throughout my whole career
[22:32.840 --> 22:36.840]  in the in the cannabis industry was growing and what it takes to win a cup.
[22:37.840 --> 22:40.840]  I remember that conversation, too.
[22:41.840 --> 22:42.840]  It's who's the best that day.
[22:43.840 --> 22:44.840]  It came out to that right.
[22:45.080 --> 22:46.080]  You got everything you got it.
[22:47.080 --> 22:48.080]  Who's the best that day?
[22:49.080 --> 22:50.080]  Things happen.
[22:50.080 --> 22:51.080]  You know what I mean?
[22:52.080 --> 22:53.080]  So you got to do all the work, be confident in it,
[22:54.080 --> 22:55.080]  and don't leave no stone unturned.
[22:56.080 --> 22:57.080]  And things happen, you know, do with your heart.
[22:58.080 --> 22:59.080]  And that's all you could do, man.
[23:00.080 --> 23:01.080]  Just do your best, but do it.
[23:02.080 --> 23:03.080]  Don't procrastinate.
[23:04.080 --> 23:05.080]  You know, be mindful of the times and be on point.
[23:06.080 --> 23:07.080]  It's all you can do.
[23:08.080 --> 23:09.080]  If you do that and you try your best.
[23:10.080 --> 23:11.080]  I mean, what else can you do?
[23:12.080 --> 23:13.080]  Yeah, so totally.
[23:13.320 --> 23:15.320]  I mean, I think it's a great thing, but there's so many things
[23:16.320 --> 23:18.320]  that can happen in the growing process, especially when it comes to cups.
[23:19.320 --> 23:20.320]  I mean, drying and curing is so huge.
[23:21.320 --> 23:24.320]  You know, it's like that at the end of the day,
[23:25.320 --> 23:27.320]  you have to put all this work in all these steps.
[23:28.320 --> 23:31.320]  And there's so many variables that will affect your entry.
[23:32.320 --> 23:35.320]  What do you think besides having genetics?
[23:36.320 --> 23:37.320]  Because both of us are in agreement that genetics are probably
[23:38.320 --> 23:40.320]  the single most important thing with quality cannabis.
[23:40.560 --> 23:42.560]  If you don't have that foundation, you can't do anything else.
[23:43.560 --> 23:46.560]  Well, what do you think as far as other factors being important
[23:47.560 --> 23:48.560]  for winning cups?
[23:49.560 --> 23:50.560]  Other factors.
[23:51.560 --> 23:55.560]  Well, first I want to say back when we were doing it,
[23:56.560 --> 23:57.560]  it was more grass roots.
[23:58.560 --> 24:01.560]  It was more raw.
[24:02.560 --> 24:04.560]  I'm not saying it's not real right now, but there's other things
[24:05.560 --> 24:06.560]  coming into play now.
[24:07.560 --> 24:08.560]  Before it was like we're after the flavor.
[24:08.800 --> 24:09.800]  We're still after that.
[24:10.800 --> 24:13.800]  But a lot of things this time around, a lot of it is presentation.
[24:14.800 --> 24:18.800]  A lot of it looks good, the packaging, but the legs
[24:19.800 --> 24:21.800]  and certain properties are just not there from my experience.
[24:22.800 --> 24:24.800]  I mean, there's a couple of strains out there that are impressive to me,
[24:25.800 --> 24:27.800]  but I'm not really impressed with what's going on, to be honest with you.
[24:28.800 --> 24:29.800]  I expected it to be further along.
[24:30.800 --> 24:33.800]  I mean, we've got great breeders and all, but the quality of cannabis
[24:34.800 --> 24:37.800]  is just, I don't know, a lot of you got a lot of these companies
[24:38.800 --> 24:41.800]  and they're not attached to it the same way as us.
[24:42.800 --> 24:45.800]  They're in it for profit and mass production and bringing the most bang
[24:46.800 --> 24:49.800]  for your buck, but that's not everything.
[24:50.800 --> 24:53.800]  I was chasing taste and chasing other things.
[24:54.800 --> 24:56.800]  And I believe when you do things with your heart, money will come with that.
[24:57.800 --> 24:58.800]  You just can't.
[24:59.800 --> 25:05.800]  It has to be passion based for you to maximize profit capability, I think.
[25:06.040 --> 25:09.040]  Yeah, it's like the marketing has gone up and the quality has gone down.
[25:10.040 --> 25:11.040]  Absolutely, it's all about that.
[25:12.040 --> 25:14.040]  All the social media stuff, it's all a big play in all the way.
[25:15.040 --> 25:17.040]  They have fake packaging in downtown LA where you can buy runs.
[25:18.040 --> 25:20.040]  You can buy all the packaging already made and put whatever you want in it.
[25:21.040 --> 25:23.040]  It's a big old scam. Everyone's aware of the game now.
[25:24.040 --> 25:25.040]  And they have a lot of tricks going on now.
[25:26.040 --> 25:28.040]  So I just let it play out a little bit.
[25:29.040 --> 25:33.040]  But not only is the packaging generic and fake,
[25:33.280 --> 25:35.280]  but even a lot of these people, these corporate people coming in,
[25:36.280 --> 25:37.280]  their hearts not attached, their passion not attached.
[25:38.280 --> 25:41.280]  All it is is attached to the money and the perspective of the industry
[25:42.280 --> 25:43.280]  is changing the industry.
[25:44.280 --> 25:46.280]  I grew up when it was grassroot, when it wasn't even medical.
[25:47.280 --> 25:50.280]  And I always knew the truth about the plant and I advocated for it.
[25:51.280 --> 25:52.280]  It's not that now.
[25:53.280 --> 25:56.280]  We have some that still advocate for it, but a lot of it is corporate based.
[25:57.280 --> 25:58.280]  And that feeling has gone away.
[25:58.520 --> 26:00.520]  And they're changing the way cannabis is being grown
[26:01.520 --> 26:02.520]  because they don't even understand it.
[26:03.520 --> 26:04.520]  They want production and the most profit.
[26:05.520 --> 26:08.520]  That's how it's been based on for a lot of people.
[26:09.520 --> 26:12.520]  Not everyone, but for a lot of people, newcomers into the industry.
[26:13.520 --> 26:14.520]  So that's from my experience.
[26:15.520 --> 26:17.520]  Yeah. I think back in the nineties,
[26:18.520 --> 26:20.520]  I think a lot of people think of the varieties being better
[26:21.520 --> 26:22.520]  and the weed being better today.
[26:23.520 --> 26:24.520]  The people that don't know.
[26:25.520 --> 26:26.520]  Yeah. But back in the nineties,
[26:26.760 --> 26:27.760]  it's like the cannabis.
[26:28.760 --> 26:29.760]  I feel like there was less people growing,
[26:30.760 --> 26:31.760]  but there was more passionate people growing.
[26:32.760 --> 26:33.760]  There was money to be made.
[26:34.760 --> 26:35.760]  Don't get me wrong.
[26:36.760 --> 26:37.760]  There was definitely money to be made,
[26:38.760 --> 26:39.760]  but it wasn't all about money.
[26:40.760 --> 26:41.760]  And if you didn't have a quality product,
[26:42.760 --> 26:43.760]  it wasn't worth a lot of money.
[26:44.760 --> 26:45.760]  And now you can have stuff that looks,
[26:46.760 --> 26:47.760]  you have stuff that looks amazing and smells amazing.
[26:48.760 --> 26:49.760]  That doesn't taste like anything.
[26:50.760 --> 26:51.760]  But has a lot of followers.
[26:52.760 --> 26:53.760]  They focus on that.
[26:54.760 --> 26:55.760]  So the advertising.
[26:56.760 --> 26:59.760]  Yeah. The whole marketing and advertising has really taken over.
[27:00.760 --> 27:01.760]  Yes, it has.
[27:02.760 --> 27:05.760]  So let's talk about the best ways to win a cup.
[27:06.760 --> 27:08.760]  Do you think timing?
[27:09.760 --> 27:12.760]  You've won a lot of cups and a lot of awards.
[27:13.760 --> 27:14.760]  Do you think timing is essential for it?
[27:15.760 --> 27:17.760]  Absolutely. Timing is everything.
[27:18.760 --> 27:20.760]  And you can't just put all your marbles in one basket.
[27:21.760 --> 27:24.760]  I would project cups a year in advance.
[27:25.000 --> 27:26.000]  I would be preparing for cups a year in advance.
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.000]  You got to grow it.
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  It got to be cut at the same time.
[27:31.000 --> 27:32.000]  You got to factor in dry time.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  You know what I mean?
[27:35.000 --> 27:36.000]  Curing time.
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.000]  All that comes in.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  And if like I told you that day,
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  who's the best that day?
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.000]  Like it goes back to our training, bro.
[27:45.000 --> 27:46.000]  Like jujitsu, whatever.
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  You train hard, you practice hard, you train,
[27:49.000 --> 27:50.000]  you're preparing for a competition.
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.000]  But during that preparation, things happen.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  You could get hurt.
[27:54.240 --> 27:55.240]  Did you cut your plants right?
[27:56.240 --> 27:57.240]  Did you give enough cure time?
[27:58.240 --> 27:59.240]  That little two weeks extra, the two weeks left.
[28:00.240 --> 28:01.240]  Like, do you understand there's breaking points
[28:02.240 --> 28:03.240]  and there's prime time spots, bro.
[28:04.240 --> 28:05.240]  And if you get them and if you create a choice
[28:06.240 --> 28:07.240]  for yourself where you have three samples
[28:08.240 --> 28:09.240]  instead of one, the best of the best goals, bro.
[28:10.240 --> 28:11.240]  That's what I would do.
[28:12.240 --> 28:13.240]  I would plan it a year ahead of time.
[28:14.240 --> 28:15.240]  The dates you had to turn things in.
[28:16.240 --> 28:17.240]  I lined it up.
[28:18.240 --> 28:19.240]  It wasn't just done blindly.
[28:20.240 --> 28:21.240]  I strategized for it.
[28:22.240 --> 28:23.240]  I had to.
[28:23.480 --> 28:24.480]  I'm blessed that I did that.
[28:25.480 --> 28:26.480]  I'm really happy that I did it
[28:27.480 --> 28:28.480]  because the outcome of everything
[28:29.480 --> 28:30.480]  was beyond my imagination
[28:31.480 --> 28:32.480]  and it's changed my life forever.
[28:33.480 --> 28:34.480]  And I'm truly humbled and grateful
[28:35.480 --> 28:36.480]  for that forever.
[28:37.480 --> 28:38.480]  You know, for sure.
[28:39.480 --> 28:40.480]  So let's talk about jujitsu.
[28:41.480 --> 28:42.480]  You know, I think jujitsu has been
[28:43.480 --> 28:44.480]  a part of both of our lives,
[28:45.480 --> 28:46.480]  an important part of both of our lives.
[28:47.480 --> 28:48.480]  So do you want to talk about a little bit
[28:49.480 --> 28:50.480]  about your history with jujitsu
[28:51.480 --> 28:52.480]  and how that's kind of shaped your life
[28:53.480 --> 28:54.480]  and how that has a connection
[28:55.480 --> 28:56.480]  to what I did with the dispensary
[28:57.480 --> 29:01.480]  because back in 96, 97,
[29:02.480 --> 29:03.480]  oh, you know what?
[29:04.480 --> 29:05.480]  I was training out with Fabiano Iha,
[29:06.480 --> 29:07.480]  Rick Lucero.
[29:08.480 --> 29:09.480]  In 2000, I opened a school
[29:10.480 --> 29:11.480]  called Submission Company in Covina.
[29:12.480 --> 29:13.480]  And we had a,
[29:14.480 --> 29:15.480]  we're one of the first jujitsu schools
[29:16.480 --> 29:17.480]  out there and we would,
[29:18.480 --> 29:19.480]  you know, we had a lot of students,
[29:20.480 --> 29:21.480]  but I focused on the business part a lot,
[29:21.720 --> 29:22.720]  which we brought fighters in.
[29:23.720 --> 29:24.720]  We were able to, you know,
[29:25.720 --> 29:26.720]  get them out to King of the Cage
[29:27.720 --> 29:30.060]  and all that.
[29:31.060 --> 29:32.060]  But I guess I'm going into the business part
[29:33.060 --> 29:34.060]  of the jujitsu,
[29:35.060 --> 29:36.060]  how I transitioned with the business
[29:37.060 --> 29:38.060]  because my experience owning a jujitsu school,
[29:39.060 --> 29:40.060]  it helped me prepare
[29:41.060 --> 29:42.060]  for winning the Cubs here.
[29:43.060 --> 29:44.060]  I didn't get a chance to compete
[29:45.060 --> 29:46.060]  in the jujitsu.
[29:46.060 --> 29:47.060]  I competed in it,
[29:48.060 --> 29:49.060]  but not in all the MMA that I wanted
[29:50.060 --> 29:51.060]  and all that.
[29:51.060 --> 29:52.060]  I didn't get a chance to do that
[29:52.300 --> 29:53.300]  because my partner had a,
[29:54.300 --> 29:55.300]  it was a,
[29:56.300 --> 29:57.300]  it was a conflict of interest.
[29:58.300 --> 29:59.300]  I was the money guy.
[29:59.300 --> 30:00.300]  It was just a little tension there
[30:01.300 --> 30:02.300]  because, you know,
[30:03.300 --> 30:04.300]  the money wasn't like he wasn't
[30:05.300 --> 30:06.300]  controlling the money.
[30:07.300 --> 30:08.300]  He didn't like that.
[30:08.300 --> 30:09.300]  So he had the fighters that would come in.
[30:10.300 --> 30:11.300]  He would,
[30:12.300 --> 30:13.300]  he would kind of create a little circle
[30:14.300 --> 30:15.300]  around them and I was separate from that.
[30:16.300 --> 30:17.300]  But
[30:18.300 --> 30:19.300]  what I,
[30:20.300 --> 30:21.300]  what I learned from that is
[30:22.300 --> 30:23.300]  you have to compete
[30:24.300 --> 30:25.300]  and put in the time
[30:26.300 --> 30:27.300]  to make your name.
[30:27.300 --> 30:28.300]  And that's what I didn't do in the jujitsu.
[30:29.300 --> 30:30.300]  I mean, I competed in basic jujitsu tournaments,
[30:31.300 --> 30:32.300]  but not so much the MMA.
[30:33.300 --> 30:34.300]  And my focus was on running the business
[30:35.300 --> 30:36.300]  and doing that and doing all the books
[30:37.300 --> 30:38.300]  and stuff.
[30:38.300 --> 30:39.300]  So I couldn't, you know,
[30:40.300 --> 30:41.300]  and even then my instructor wasn't fully on me.
[30:42.300 --> 30:43.300]  But what I did learn
[30:44.300 --> 30:45.300]  when I,
[30:45.300 --> 30:46.300]  when I got into the,
[30:47.300 --> 30:48.300]  when I had my dispensary
[30:49.300 --> 30:50.300]  to compete,
[30:50.300 --> 30:51.300]  just compete,
[30:51.540 --> 30:52.540]  build your name no matter what.
[30:53.540 --> 30:54.540]  And that's learning from that experience.
[30:55.540 --> 30:56.540]  That's what I did this time.
[30:57.540 --> 30:58.540]  I just competed,
[30:58.540 --> 30:59.540]  competed,
[30:59.540 --> 31:00.540]  built my name.
[31:00.540 --> 31:01.540]  So I was able to develop my own stuff
[31:02.540 --> 31:03.540]  and not really put someone else's name in line.
[31:04.540 --> 31:05.540]  So really,
[31:05.540 --> 31:06.540]  I mean, I did the jujitsu.
[31:06.540 --> 31:07.540]  I was so passionate about it and I had money
[31:08.540 --> 31:09.540]  and I was just like,
[31:09.540 --> 31:10.540]  I wanted to do it forever.
[31:11.540 --> 31:12.540]  But things happen.
[31:13.540 --> 31:14.540]  And,
[31:14.540 --> 31:15.540]  you know,
[31:15.540 --> 31:16.540]  I'm glad that it trained me for this though,
[31:17.540 --> 31:18.540]  because I was able to lock in this
[31:19.540 --> 31:20.540]  for myself.
[31:20.780 --> 31:21.780]  But on a training perspective,
[31:22.780 --> 31:23.780]  I mean,
[31:23.780 --> 31:24.780]  I'm a purple belt in jujitsu.
[31:25.780 --> 31:26.780]  I've trained with a few different instructors,
[31:27.780 --> 31:28.780]  Cleber Luciano, Fabiano Iha,
[31:29.780 --> 31:30.780]  Rick Lucero,
[31:30.780 --> 31:31.780]  Joe Moriera.
[31:31.780 --> 31:32.780]  But,
[31:33.780 --> 31:34.780]  that's way back in the day.
[31:35.780 --> 31:36.780]  I mean,
[31:36.780 --> 31:37.780]  it was my history,
[31:37.780 --> 31:38.780]  but it taught me,
[31:39.780 --> 31:40.780]  it taught me discipline,
[31:40.780 --> 31:41.780]  you know,
[31:41.780 --> 31:42.780]  and it taught me business for this.
[31:43.780 --> 31:44.780]  So I'm grateful.
[31:44.780 --> 31:45.780]  I'm grateful for that.
[31:45.780 --> 31:46.780]  Jujitsu changed my life though,
[31:46.780 --> 31:47.780]  for sure.
[31:47.780 --> 31:48.780]  For sure.
[31:48.780 --> 31:49.780]  Sure.
[31:50.020 --> 31:51.020]  I mean,
[31:51.020 --> 31:52.020]  I think repetition and grinding
[31:53.020 --> 31:54.020]  and showing up every day,
[31:54.020 --> 31:55.020]  I think
[31:56.020 --> 31:57.020]  that's the biggest thing.
[31:57.020 --> 31:58.020]  Yeah.
[31:58.020 --> 31:59.020]  That's the biggest thing is like
[32:00.020 --> 32:01.020]  consistency.
[32:01.020 --> 32:02.020]  Consistency is just so important.
[32:03.020 --> 32:04.020]  And I think,
[32:04.020 --> 32:05.020]  you know,
[32:05.020 --> 32:06.020]  I work as a chef too.
[32:06.020 --> 32:07.020]  I've worked as a chef in the past,
[32:07.020 --> 32:08.020]  over the past 20 years.
[32:09.020 --> 32:10.020]  And it's the same thing.
[32:10.020 --> 32:11.020]  It's like,
[32:11.020 --> 32:12.020]  you know,
[32:12.020 --> 32:13.020]  repetition,
[32:13.020 --> 32:14.020]  repetition builds character,
[32:14.020 --> 32:15.020]  just like jujitsu.
[32:15.020 --> 32:16.020]  And the thing is,
[32:16.020 --> 32:17.020]  is like,
[32:17.020 --> 32:18.020]  no matter how good you think you are
[32:18.020 --> 32:19.020]  or how tough you think you are in the beginning,
[32:19.260 --> 32:20.260]  you're not going to get there right away
[32:21.260 --> 32:22.260]  because you have guys that are like 120 pounds
[32:23.260 --> 32:24.260]  that are working around you
[32:24.260 --> 32:25.260]  and smashing you.
[32:25.260 --> 32:26.260]  I'm a big guy.
[32:26.260 --> 32:27.260]  I'm like over,
[32:27.260 --> 32:28.260]  I'm like 240 right now.
[32:28.260 --> 32:29.260]  But when I started jujitsu,
[32:29.260 --> 32:30.260]  I was like 230.
[32:30.260 --> 32:31.260]  And I would have guys that are 120 pounds
[32:32.260 --> 32:33.260]  just fricking choking me out
[32:34.260 --> 32:35.260]  and making me feel bad about myself
[32:36.260 --> 32:37.260]  in the beginning a little bit.
[32:38.260 --> 32:39.260]  But then,
[32:39.260 --> 32:40.260]  you know,
[32:40.260 --> 32:41.260]  you realize you start progressing.
[32:42.260 --> 32:43.260]  And then once you see yourself progressing,
[32:44.260 --> 32:45.260]  you start really feeling good about who you are.
[32:46.260 --> 32:47.260]  You kind of know your place in the world.
[32:47.500 --> 32:48.500]  And that's a big level of confidence.
[32:49.500 --> 32:50.500]  And Tommy,
[32:50.500 --> 32:51.500]  repetition,
[32:51.500 --> 32:52.500]  put your head down
[32:52.500 --> 32:53.500]  and be consistent with the repetition.
[32:54.500 --> 32:55.500]  And that strategy over,
[32:55.500 --> 32:56.500]  it overspills in a lot of things in life.
[32:57.500 --> 32:58.500]  You know what I mean?
[32:58.500 --> 32:59.500]  Even in cannabis,
[32:59.500 --> 33:00.500]  it's repetition.
[33:00.500 --> 33:01.500]  It's not rocket science.
[33:01.500 --> 33:02.500]  You know,
[33:02.500 --> 33:03.500]  you have to be,
[33:03.500 --> 33:04.500]  you have to be receptive
[33:04.500 --> 33:05.500]  to what's going on with the plan
[33:05.500 --> 33:06.500]  and be able to heal it
[33:06.500 --> 33:07.500]  and,
[33:07.500 --> 33:08.500]  you know,
[33:08.500 --> 33:09.500]  be able to do that.
[33:09.500 --> 33:10.500]  But if you stick to a plan,
[33:10.500 --> 33:11.500]  you could prevent problems,
[33:11.500 --> 33:12.500]  stick to the program
[33:12.500 --> 33:13.500]  and it'll do what it needs to do.
[33:13.500 --> 33:14.500]  You know,
[33:14.500 --> 33:15.500]  just be on time.
[33:15.500 --> 33:16.500]  That's it.
[33:16.740 --> 33:17.740]  And that's the key thing,
[33:17.740 --> 33:18.740]  even for the plants,
[33:18.740 --> 33:19.740]  you know,
[33:19.740 --> 33:20.740]  so.
[33:20.740 --> 33:21.740]  Yeah.
[33:21.740 --> 33:22.740]  And Jiu Jitsu.
[33:22.740 --> 33:23.740]  So there's a one,
[33:23.740 --> 33:24.740]  one big thing with Jiu Jitsu
[33:24.740 --> 33:25.740]  and cannabis,
[33:25.740 --> 33:26.740]  I think go hand in hand to,
[33:26.740 --> 33:27.740]  you know,
[33:27.740 --> 33:28.740]  side by side,
[33:28.740 --> 33:29.740]  uh,
[33:29.740 --> 33:30.740]  the flow where,
[33:30.740 --> 33:31.740]  where like you smoke,
[33:31.740 --> 33:32.740]  you know,
[33:32.740 --> 33:33.740]  I think you just,
[33:33.740 --> 33:34.740]  you can't go wrong with Jiu Jitsu and cannabis.
[33:34.740 --> 33:35.740]  And I'm not a heavy smoker like Nate Diaz or Nick Diaz.
[33:35.740 --> 33:36.740]  Those guys,
[33:36.740 --> 33:37.740]  Joe Rogan,
[33:37.740 --> 33:38.740]  those guys will just blast off.
[33:38.740 --> 33:39.740]  It's super lit.
[33:39.740 --> 33:40.740]  And,
[33:40.740 --> 33:41.740]  you know,
[33:41.740 --> 33:42.740]  a lot of the Brazilians,
[33:42.740 --> 33:43.740]  a lot of the Brazilians,
[33:43.740 --> 33:44.740]  they're like,
[33:44.740 --> 33:45.740]  I'm going to do this.
[33:45.980 --> 33:49.180]  A lot of the Brazilians we know they get really fricking lit.
[33:49.180 --> 33:50.180]  I like,
[33:50.180 --> 33:51.180]  you know,
[33:51.180 --> 33:52.180]  I'm more of the microdose and roll,
[33:52.180 --> 33:54.820]  not the get blasted and roll.
[33:54.820 --> 33:55.820]  So yeah,
[33:55.820 --> 33:56.820]  I did,
[33:56.820 --> 33:59.820]  I actually did one of the seminars with Hickson not too long ago,
[33:59.820 --> 34:00.820]  2017,
[34:00.820 --> 34:01.820]  uh,
[34:01.820 --> 34:02.820]  with Hicks and Gracie.
[34:02.820 --> 34:06.620]  I was blessed to actually do it with Hicks.
[34:06.620 --> 34:07.620]  And yeah,
[34:07.620 --> 34:08.620]  he did,
[34:08.620 --> 34:09.620]  he did a seminar.
[34:09.620 --> 34:10.620]  It was amazing.
[34:10.620 --> 34:11.620]  I got some pictures with them.
[34:11.620 --> 34:12.620]  And so,
[34:12.620 --> 34:13.620]  yeah,
[34:13.620 --> 34:14.620]  so,
[34:14.620 --> 34:15.620]  uh,
[34:16.500 --> 34:17.500]  but,
[34:17.500 --> 34:18.500]  uh,
[34:18.500 --> 34:19.500]  let's talk about real quick,
[34:19.500 --> 34:20.500]  drying and curing,
[34:20.500 --> 34:21.500]  how you feel about drying and curing,
[34:21.500 --> 34:22.500]  uh,
[34:22.500 --> 34:23.500]  and your method for drying and curing cannabis.
[34:23.500 --> 34:24.500]  So I think that's one,
[34:24.500 --> 34:25.500]  we had some questions about it,
[34:25.500 --> 34:26.500]  uh,
[34:26.500 --> 34:27.500]  last week.
[34:27.500 --> 34:28.500]  And I feel like your,
[34:28.500 --> 34:29.500]  your products always come out perfect that I've seen.
[34:29.500 --> 34:30.500]  Even maybe you just tell me the good stuff,
[34:30.500 --> 34:31.500]  but you know that,
[34:31.500 --> 34:32.500]  you know what I mean?
[34:32.500 --> 34:33.500]  But for sure,
[34:33.500 --> 34:34.500]  there's a method to it.
[34:34.500 --> 34:35.500]  You know what I like?
[34:35.500 --> 34:36.500]  It's when you harvest,
[34:36.500 --> 34:37.500]  when you,
[34:37.500 --> 34:38.500]  you harvest,
[34:38.500 --> 34:39.500]  you harvest,
[34:39.500 --> 34:40.500]  you harvest,
[34:40.500 --> 34:41.500]  you harvest,
[34:41.500 --> 34:42.500]  you harvest,
[34:42.500 --> 34:43.500]  you harvest,
[34:43.500 --> 34:44.500]  you harvest,
[34:44.500 --> 34:45.500]  you harvest,
[34:45.580 --> 34:46.580]  and then you're drying.
[34:46.580 --> 34:47.580]  I dry in like 65,
[34:47.580 --> 34:48.580]  68.
[34:48.580 --> 34:49.580]  It's a slow,
[34:49.580 --> 34:50.580]  a slow cure,
[34:50.580 --> 34:51.580]  slow dry.
[34:51.580 --> 34:52.580]  You know what I mean?
[34:52.580 --> 34:53.580]  I think that,
[34:53.580 --> 34:54.580]  that brings it out,
[34:54.580 --> 34:55.580]  you know?
[34:55.580 --> 34:56.580]  So like a two week cure,
[34:56.580 --> 34:57.580]  do you do like a whole two week cure?
[34:57.580 --> 34:58.580]  Absolutely,
[34:58.580 --> 34:59.580]  bro,
[34:59.580 --> 35:00.580]  absolutely.
[35:00.580 --> 35:01.580]  You can,
[35:01.580 --> 35:02.580]  I mean,
[35:02.580 --> 35:03.580]  I've done it in a week.
[35:03.580 --> 35:04.580]  I mean,
[35:04.580 --> 35:05.580]  I see the differences when I do them,
[35:05.580 --> 35:06.580]  you know,
[35:06.580 --> 35:08.300]  and I'll put them in different packagings and stuff like that,
[35:08.300 --> 35:11.700]  just so you could see what the best method is.
[35:11.700 --> 35:13.780]  But I typically,
[35:13.780 --> 35:15.940]  I could do that two week cure and yeah,
[35:15.940 --> 35:16.940]  they're pretty on right there,
[35:16.940 --> 35:17.940]  bro.
[35:17.940 --> 35:18.940]  They're pretty good.
[35:18.940 --> 35:19.940]  Once I put them back in,
[35:19.940 --> 35:20.940]  I'll put them in a bag.
[35:20.940 --> 35:21.940]  They,
[35:21.940 --> 35:22.940]  they,
[35:22.940 --> 35:23.940]  they re-moisten up and then get it all out,
[35:23.940 --> 35:24.940]  dry it,
[35:24.940 --> 35:25.940]  just cure it really good.
[35:25.940 --> 35:26.940]  You know,
[35:26.940 --> 35:27.940]  get all the moisture out.
[35:27.940 --> 35:28.940]  It's good.
[35:28.940 --> 35:29.940]  In like about two weeks,
[35:29.940 --> 35:30.940]  it's,
[35:30.940 --> 35:31.940]  it's,
[35:31.940 --> 35:32.940]  it's good.
[35:32.940 --> 35:33.940]  You leave it a little longer and it gets even a little bit better,
[35:33.940 --> 35:34.940]  but the,
[35:34.940 --> 35:35.940]  the taste and stuff start changing a little bit.
[35:35.940 --> 35:36.940]  I like that fresh,
[35:36.940 --> 35:37.940]  clean,
[35:37.940 --> 35:38.940]  green.
[35:38.940 --> 35:39.940]  Don't get me wrong after a month,
[35:39.940 --> 35:40.940]  it's still,
[35:40.940 --> 35:41.940]  it's still,
[35:41.940 --> 35:42.940]  it's still,
[35:42.940 --> 35:43.940]  but the personalities change a little bit,
[35:43.940 --> 35:44.940]  you know,
[35:44.940 --> 35:45.940]  but it's,
[35:45.940 --> 35:46.940]  you know,
[35:46.940 --> 35:47.940]  I like that.
[35:47.940 --> 35:48.940]  There's little subtle things that I,
[35:48.940 --> 35:49.940]  that I try to focus on.
[35:49.940 --> 35:50.940]  So like for me,
[35:50.940 --> 35:53.580]  I go to humidity at 50 for two days and then I,
[35:53.580 --> 35:54.860]  I go 55,
[35:54.860 --> 35:55.860]  60.
[35:55.860 --> 35:56.860]  And then where,
[35:56.860 --> 35:57.860]  where do you,
[35:57.860 --> 35:58.860]  and I let it sit at,
[35:58.860 --> 35:59.860]  you know,
[35:59.860 --> 36:00.860]  64.
[36:00.860 --> 36:01.860]  Where,
[36:01.860 --> 36:02.860]  where do you let your sit humidity wise?
[36:02.860 --> 36:03.860]  It's like,
[36:03.860 --> 36:04.860]  Oh man,
[36:04.860 --> 36:10.240]  I think it's like 52 degrees bro.
[36:10.240 --> 36:12.280]  50 degrees around there.
[36:12.280 --> 36:13.120]  Yeah.
[36:14.200 --> 36:17.140]  Yeah, and then if you're drying,
[36:17.140 --> 36:20.000]  how long after that would you enter it into a cup?
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.760]  You know, obviously you wouldn't wanna do it right away
[36:22.760 --> 36:24.080]  because you gotta cure it out.
[36:24.080 --> 36:25.200]  And do you cure it in glass?
[36:25.200 --> 36:27.000]  Do you cure it in bags?
[36:27.000 --> 36:27.840]  What's your-
[36:27.840 --> 36:28.660]  Well, I do both.
[36:28.660 --> 36:29.500]  It depends where it's going.
[36:29.500 --> 36:31.220]  Like I'll be exclusive and pick certain ones.
[36:31.220 --> 36:33.360]  And if I could put them in glass, put them in bags,
[36:33.360 --> 36:36.760]  but you know what I'll do?
[36:36.760 --> 36:39.240]  If I'm doing showings, I'll hand pick certain things,
[36:39.240 --> 36:40.880]  put it in glass, cure them differently,
[36:40.880 --> 36:41.960]  put the rest in bags.
[36:41.960 --> 36:44.000]  And I mean, I've done both, you know,
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.280]  and they come out typically good in both, to be honest,
[36:46.280 --> 36:49.480]  which is just less damage in the glass.
[36:49.480 --> 36:51.720]  And it just sits, I don't know, it's a little different,
[36:51.720 --> 36:52.560]  you know what I mean?
[36:52.560 --> 36:56.080]  But yeah, it's not too much, you know.
[36:57.560 --> 36:59.720]  So you pull the fans off and hang whole plant
[36:59.720 --> 37:02.260]  or do you buck and hang branches?
[37:04.480 --> 37:07.840]  Take the leaves off and hang the whole plant.
[37:07.840 --> 37:08.680]  Yeah.
[37:08.680 --> 37:09.520]  Yeah.
[37:09.520 --> 37:10.340]  Just quick pick, yeah.
[37:10.740 --> 37:12.420]  Take the branches off and then just, you know,
[37:12.420 --> 37:13.260]  have a tree.
[37:16.940 --> 37:17.780]  Yeah.
[37:17.780 --> 37:20.380]  So we got a band coming on, Peter, are you back there?
[37:20.380 --> 37:21.500]  You hiding from us?
[37:23.500 --> 37:24.860]  Oh, you muted yourself.
[37:24.860 --> 37:25.700]  Yes.
[37:25.700 --> 37:27.300]  I've been muting everyone.
[37:27.300 --> 37:29.340]  They're imminently coming on.
[37:29.340 --> 37:30.160]  Yeah.
[37:30.160 --> 37:32.020]  Their issue is they have neighbors who complain
[37:32.020 --> 37:33.500]  when they play music late at night.
[37:33.500 --> 37:35.220]  So they got, they're like, we just got to do it now.
[37:35.220 --> 37:37.540]  If we do it, I was like, all right, let's do it.
[37:37.540 --> 37:40.320]  And then, so they'll be on any minute.
[37:41.120 --> 37:43.120]  When they're on, can you check your email?
[37:43.120 --> 37:45.160]  Cause I promised someone that we would look
[37:45.160 --> 37:47.520]  at his breeding question.
[37:47.520 --> 37:50.880]  And it's a very lengthy one that has multiple paragraphs.
[37:50.880 --> 37:52.640]  You can do it.
[37:52.640 --> 37:57.640]  And I was gonna see if my Kenny Florian
[37:59.520 --> 38:01.360]  I grew up with in Massachusetts.
[38:01.360 --> 38:03.480]  And I was gonna, as you guys were talking MMA
[38:03.480 --> 38:04.640]  and the Gracies and stuff,
[38:04.640 --> 38:07.680]  I was gonna see if he wanted to jump on with us.
[38:07.680 --> 38:12.400]  But now we got our, let me see where the,
[38:12.400 --> 38:13.820]  our musicians are.
[38:15.200 --> 38:16.960]  You ready?
[38:21.290 --> 38:22.950]  Everybody give us a minute.
[38:27.150 --> 38:28.510]  You got the email?
[38:28.510 --> 38:29.670]  I do got the email.
[38:29.670 --> 38:32.070]  It's a, you know, there's a lot to this.
[38:32.070 --> 38:32.910]  Right.
[38:33.830 --> 38:36.470]  So I will, I'm gonna respond
[38:36.470 --> 38:38.590]  and we can talk about it on next week's show
[38:38.590 --> 38:40.390]  just cause I want to make sure I have everything right
[38:40.390 --> 38:41.230]  for this guy.
[38:41.350 --> 38:44.190]  He's talking about a lot of stuff here, which is great.
[38:44.190 --> 38:45.510]  I love questions like this.
[38:45.510 --> 38:47.790]  If you have questions, you can email Peter,
[38:47.790 --> 38:49.230]  send messages to Peter on the show.
[38:49.230 --> 38:52.330]  You can email me at jamesloudgenetics at gmail.com.
[38:54.910 --> 38:57.590]  So someone said, one of the Black Friday order
[38:57.590 --> 38:58.430]  is gonna go out.
[38:58.430 --> 39:03.430]  Well, I got a lot of vials
[39:05.550 --> 39:12.290]  and a lot of seeds.
[39:12.290 --> 39:13.590]  That's just some of them.
[39:17.800 --> 39:19.760]  A lot of Mylar bags.
[39:20.680 --> 39:24.040]  I got a whole lot of,
[39:24.040 --> 39:26.600]  I got a whole lot of packaging to do.
[39:26.600 --> 39:28.360]  Oh, do you want to show people the labels?
[39:28.360 --> 39:29.200]  Yeah.
[39:29.200 --> 39:30.200]  For the Ganja Farmer?
[39:41.170 --> 39:42.430]  So yeah, we got labels.
[39:42.430 --> 39:44.670]  We got labels, we got seeds, we got packaging.
[39:44.670 --> 39:46.410]  So I'll just tell you guys a little bit.
[39:46.410 --> 39:48.170]  I'm a bulk seed sales guy
[39:48.170 --> 39:50.770]  and my focus really for the last couple of years
[39:50.770 --> 39:51.850]  has been bulk seed sales.
[39:51.850 --> 39:54.410]  So I got Peter to do the packaging for me.
[39:54.410 --> 39:56.250]  So thank you, Peter.
[39:56.770 --> 39:58.050]  Peter's super psyched.
[39:58.050 --> 39:59.890]  Yeah, Peter's super psyched.
[39:59.890 --> 40:01.730]  Also, James from Seeds Here Now
[40:01.730 --> 40:04.030]  got his staff to do the packaging for me.
[40:04.030 --> 40:05.090]  I'm kind of a jerk.
[40:06.170 --> 40:07.610]  I feel a little bad now.
[40:07.610 --> 40:09.410]  We did sell a lot too.
[40:09.410 --> 40:12.510]  It's like 600 things to package up.
[40:12.510 --> 40:14.830]  But anyway, we'll talk.
[40:15.890 --> 40:18.170]  We got, look who joined the party.
[40:18.170 --> 40:21.490]  It is live from Israel, Benny and the band,
[40:21.490 --> 40:22.890]  Benny and the Jets.
[40:22.890 --> 40:24.610]  Benny and the Jets, exactly.
[40:24.610 --> 40:26.330]  So welcome guys.
[40:26.330 --> 40:28.170]  All right, so I'm gonna mute everybody else.
[40:28.170 --> 40:31.510]  Let's have a quick song and then let you guys go to bed.
[40:31.510 --> 40:32.350]  All right.
[40:33.210 --> 40:35.570]  So we're gonna do Blueberry Hill

[43:32.160 --> 43:36.160]  Yeah, you're my friend
[43:38.160 --> 43:41.160]  On Blueberry Hill
[43:41.160 --> 43:44.160]  On Blueberry Hill
[43:45.160 --> 43:48.160]  Oh yeah
[43:51.160 --> 43:52.160]  There you go.
[43:52.160 --> 43:55.160]  All right. Thank you.
[43:55.160 --> 44:02.160]  And by the way, everybody is dying to know that book on the in front of the piano.
[44:02.160 --> 44:05.160]  It looks like a penis with two big balls on it.
[44:05.160 --> 44:10.160]  It's a creative imagination, but it's a piano book for a
[44:14.160 --> 44:17.160]  human version of like a big, you know,
[44:17.160 --> 44:20.160]  a big penis with two testicles.
[44:20.160 --> 44:23.160]  So, yeah, Disney, you guys, you're my other guy.
[44:23.160 --> 44:25.160]  You might have exactly the same world. That wasn't me.
[44:25.160 --> 44:30.160]  That was everybody in the chat was like, either I'm really high or it looks like a big penis.
[44:30.160 --> 44:32.160]  Yeah, it's kind of both.
[44:33.160 --> 44:36.160]  Got it. All right. Well, we appreciate it.
[44:36.160 --> 44:39.160]  And Benny, let's check in tomorrow.
[44:39.160 --> 44:41.160]  All right. Thanks for the musical interlude.
[44:41.160 --> 44:43.160]  Live from Israel.
[44:43.160 --> 44:47.160]  And now back to our regularly scheduled program.
[44:47.160 --> 44:49.160]  Yeah.
[44:49.160 --> 44:51.160]  So we're back with Master Yoda.
[44:51.160 --> 44:59.160]  And so both both him and I have been, you know, besides cannabis and good food and other other things.
[45:00.160 --> 45:03.160]  We talked about jujitsu, but bodybuilding has been a catalyst.
[45:03.160 --> 45:08.160]  It's something that's been important to both of us as well as jujitsu that, yeah,
[45:08.160 --> 45:11.160]  he's working with Charles Glass right now.
[45:11.160 --> 45:13.160]  You don't know who Charles Glass is.
[45:13.160 --> 45:17.160]  You don't know anything about bodybuilding because Charles Glass is he trained to rock.
[45:17.160 --> 45:24.160]  He's trained flex Wheeler, I believe a bunch of top, top, Jaxter Jackson.
[45:24.160 --> 45:25.160]  Yeah, totally. Dexter Jackson.
[45:25.160 --> 45:28.160]  These guys with amazing physiques, but, you know, the rock.
[45:28.160 --> 45:32.160]  And then even like you talk about some basketball players, he's trained basketball players.
[45:32.160 --> 45:34.160]  I don't even know which ones, but L.A. Lakers.
[45:34.160 --> 45:36.160]  I remember hearing back in the day.
[45:36.160 --> 45:42.160]  And he's the he's the guy who you would want to go to if you want to learn how to do bodybuilding.
[45:42.160 --> 45:52.160]  And so tell us a little bit about your experience with bodybuilding, what you've done with that and kind of how that plays into everything as well.
[45:52.160 --> 45:58.160]  OK, it's kind of there's a time with the jujitsu on the business aspect with bodybuilding.
[45:58.160 --> 46:05.160]  It was like. We're like plants to me, it's like we're like plants, you know,
[46:05.160 --> 46:11.160]  if we keep our pH levels between a six and a seven in a nutrient, we don't get sick, we don't get diseases or nothing.
[46:11.160 --> 46:16.160]  Same with plants, right? If you can maintain that, right.
[46:16.160 --> 46:19.160]  The parts per million are calories, bro.
[46:19.160 --> 46:27.160]  That's how the when you're going to when you're going to cut your plan, we could we could up our we carve them up a little bit to bulk them up in the final stages before show time.
[46:27.160 --> 46:33.160]  Then we cut them for show time. Right. That's what we do in bodybuilding. You want to carve up, fill out for the show.
[46:33.160 --> 46:38.160]  So your part for. So think about that. If there's a it's an energy that we're catering to, bro.
[46:38.160 --> 46:42.160]  We want to maximize the energy in that living thing. What do you got to do to do that?
[46:42.160 --> 46:48.160]  That's all we're doing to the plant to us. How do you do it? Rest, recovery, nutrition.
[46:48.160 --> 46:52.160]  You understand that it's we're the same. We're all energy. Yeah.
[46:52.160 --> 46:57.160]  Maximize the energy and everything else follows from the inside out, not from the outside.
[46:57.160 --> 47:01.160]  What's happening now is people are doing the outside and trying to go inward without no inward.
[47:01.160 --> 47:07.160]  It's all just glitz and glamour, the lipstick and heels. And it's like when you take that off, what's happening?
[47:07.160 --> 47:12.160]  You know, it's all fake. It's not. There's no substance in it. There's no soul. There's no soul.
[47:12.160 --> 47:16.160]  It just looks pretty. It just looks good. You got to do it from the inside out. Focus on the energies.
[47:17.160 --> 47:26.160]  I just. With you talking in my head like the L.A. weed scene, why it looks like it does, it's a lot of soulless weed down there.
[47:26.160 --> 47:30.160]  I'm not saying it's all soulless, but there's a lot of stuff that looks absolutely amazing.
[47:30.160 --> 47:35.160]  Maybe some of the best stuff I've ever seen in my whole life in L.A. looks absolutely stunning.
[47:35.160 --> 47:38.160]  It might even have a good nose on it, but then you got to smoke it and it's let down.
[47:38.160 --> 47:44.160]  We call that soulless weed. And I feel like there's not that there's a lot of soulless people,
[47:44.160 --> 47:50.160]  but there is definitely it's people in L.A. They're very focused on the way they look, the way they present themselves.
[47:50.160 --> 47:55.160]  But what's the substance underneath? And tell me that even more now.
[47:55.160 --> 48:00.160]  Sure. Yeah. Yeah. People really concerned about how they look and how they feel.
[48:00.160 --> 48:03.160]  But it's like, what are you eating? What are you putting in your body? Right.
[48:03.160 --> 48:07.160]  How do you act? What are you know, as far as like your surroundings, your actions?
[48:07.160 --> 48:11.160]  What are you doing to make the world a better place? Your surroundings a better place?
[48:11.160 --> 48:18.160]  How are your intentions? Are they good? Are they bad? All that matters to maximizing that production, that energy.
[48:18.160 --> 48:22.160]  You know what I mean? Right. Yeah. So we got to join.
[48:22.160 --> 48:26.160]  We got to join us. The Red Congolese right here.
[48:26.160 --> 48:29.160]  Alfred, roll this up. We're going to smoke some hits off of this.
[48:29.160 --> 48:33.160]  This Red Congolese, it's a land race strain from Africa.
[48:33.160 --> 48:37.160]  I got it from Red Seal in San Francisco for my guys over there.
[48:37.160 --> 48:41.160]  See, we need to find a lighter. Might not be a lighter.
[48:41.160 --> 48:44.160]  Yeah, we're going to talk about some weed right now.
[48:44.160 --> 48:48.160]  We got some Master Kush, the Master Yoda Kush to smoke as well.
[48:48.160 --> 48:54.160]  But, you know, you want to talk about land race varieties as well. Your experience with any land race?
[48:54.160 --> 49:03.160]  I have not done any of that, bro. Honestly, with all this, with all this new transition coming in, it's like I've had to walk away from a couple of facilities.
[49:04.160 --> 49:09.160]  So being in my comfort zone where I can expand my knowledge, I'm kind of still right there.
[49:09.160 --> 49:13.160]  You know, I still got to get that facility again. But we're just doing a couple of little basic things.
[49:13.160 --> 49:22.160]  But we'll get there again. We're just being patient, waiting for the right chance, not getting impulsive or nothing, you know, making sure it's all right, making sure everybody in the team is right.
[49:22.160 --> 49:26.160]  You know, it's not a one man operation. You have to have the right team.
[49:26.160 --> 49:30.160]  You know, it's bigger than us. For sure.
[49:31.160 --> 49:38.160]  So this is Dono G. This is definitely, you get a different high. I really, I enjoy red congolese.
[49:38.160 --> 49:46.160]  It's not the most racy of sativa equatorial type varieties, but it's another one with that open bud structure.
[49:46.160 --> 49:51.160]  It's not the stuff that you're going to find at most dispensaries.
[49:51.160 --> 49:55.160]  Most people aren't looking specifically for stuff like this, but I really like the effect.
[49:55.160 --> 49:59.160]  And I really I like the taste. I think these guys grew really well.
[49:59.160 --> 50:03.160]  It's clean. Yeah, it's good. Clean cannabis. They know what they're doing.
[50:03.160 --> 50:10.160]  We'll just add some of this right here.
[50:10.160 --> 50:20.160]  But, yeah, it's interesting, you know, and I think a lot of the future is taking the land race or close to land race varieties and breeding them with the stuff you guys like.
[50:20.160 --> 50:29.160]  So finding the gelato is if you can get you know, there's a bunch of places you can get somewhat close to land race variety seeds and taking those and breeding them in,
[50:29.160 --> 50:42.160]  getting a male or reversing one and putting it with whatever you have or vice versa, taking whatever you have, making pollen, putting it on some land race stuff and then selections in inbreeding those to improve the genetics.
[50:42.160 --> 50:45.160]  I think there's a huge market for it.
[50:45.160 --> 50:52.160]  I think that we need to start working on novel stuff because I think there's a lot of just repetition with everything that people are doing.
[50:52.160 --> 50:57.160]  There's not a lot of innovative original varieties coming out right now. We're really stuck on these gelato.
[50:57.160 --> 51:02.160]  Not that there's anything wrong with that. Yeah.
[51:02.160 --> 51:14.560]  So back to L.A. What was L.A. like before OG Kush?
[51:14.560 --> 51:27.980]  Before OG Kush? It wasn't all that, to be honest with you, but there was some good strains around.
[51:28.980 --> 51:37.980]  I had a strain called the Orange Crush before the Kush came. It was the Orange Crush. And that one was, you know about the Orange Crush, the original Orange Crush.
[51:37.980 --> 51:42.980]  I would come up to San Francisco and pick it. It wasn't something that was growing. It was here. Product of the Redwood Empire.
[51:42.980 --> 51:48.980]  I'd get bags labeled product of the Redwood Empire back in 96, bro. Like, yeah, it's crazy.
[51:49.980 --> 51:53.980]  And that was like something very special. But I wasn't growing at the time either.
[51:53.980 --> 52:01.980]  Was it dense or was it more like the bud structure of like this Red Congo? It was super orangey though, right?
[52:01.980 --> 52:11.980]  Like way before tangy. Stinky bomb. That was like my Yoda of the day back then. There was no competition. It was nothing like that.
[52:11.980 --> 52:16.980]  And before there wasn't good wheat out too much back in the day. It was a lot of Mexican wheat too.
[52:16.980 --> 52:21.980]  I helped bring the transition from the Mexican stress to my first one was Humboldt.
[52:21.980 --> 52:27.980]  My boy, he had a friend in his construction company. They grew something called Humboldt.
[52:27.980 --> 52:33.980]  That shit he brought me, bro. Oh, my God. Some hash cookies and little just fluffy, frosty nugs.
[52:33.980 --> 52:39.980]  And it was like we're still transitioning from the Mexican wheat and all that. You know what I mean?
[52:40.980 --> 52:55.980]  But that was one of the first bomb ass herbs that helped me see something way beyond this and stay on track and keep just making it better and better.
[52:55.980 --> 53:03.980]  And it was my gauge to improve off of. And I had I was picky because there wasn't much around and I would turn so much things away and I would show people what I want.
[53:03.980 --> 53:11.980]  So they had an idea of what I wanted and I looked and looked and searched. And, you know, that that orange crush was a really, really good one from the humble.
[53:11.980 --> 53:17.980]  A Northern Lights five. And then I had the orange crush. All of those for back in the day were really good.
[53:17.980 --> 53:26.980]  You know what I mean? I focused on those. I get a lot of weight from those, you know, so you guys have a master push and bubble cush before.
[53:26.980 --> 53:33.980]  Oh, gosh. All right. That was all about. It was funny. The original master Kush was like a push to me.
[53:33.980 --> 53:41.980]  It had that it was the one that had the sweet. Later on, it changed and master Kush became what they call what was above a cushion, like a Hindu influence.
[53:41.980 --> 53:48.980]  But that bubble property, it became that strain. And it was like the master to me was the master.
[53:48.980 --> 53:55.980]  It was the best one around. You know what I mean? But like I said, times change and people started calling the Bubba master.
[53:55.980 --> 54:02.980]  And it's just, yeah, I don't know if that's did you are you aware of that or are you on some of the Bubba cushion?
[54:02.980 --> 54:10.980]  It became the master. And it's like, yeah, they stopped seeing that the original some never even seen it, that the actual master was the sweet.
[54:10.980 --> 54:16.980]  Oh, gee, that was you know, there was a sweeter one. Most people in the world have never seen the true master.
[54:16.980 --> 54:22.980]  Because the one yeah, the master we had was very Christmas tree like it was sweet. It was gassy.
[54:22.980 --> 54:27.980]  It was like that real fuel gas. Oh, more like more.
[54:27.980 --> 54:32.980]  No, it wasn't like it wasn't like Bubba at all. I completely different structure for one thing.
[54:32.980 --> 54:36.980]  And it's smoke completely different. Bubba was more soapy with gas.
[54:36.980 --> 54:40.980]  We had that pre-98 Bubba and it was really, you know, that was the first thing.
[54:40.980 --> 54:44.980]  And it's still that every time I smoke some Bubba or smell some Bubba, it's like soap.
[54:44.980 --> 54:51.980]  Yeah, it's once you get used to the come on, you're used to that sweet undertone vanilla lemon like you strive to find that.
[54:51.980 --> 54:54.980]  And it's like the Bubba that just didn't have it was good. Don't get me wrong.
[54:54.980 --> 54:59.980]  And some people really like it, but they don't know something else. Put them both together and see what they say.
[54:59.980 --> 55:03.980]  They just don't know. So let's talk about OG's for a minute.
[55:04.980 --> 55:11.980]  There's a lot of varieties of G that have come out, you know, and as far as like when your master Yoda Kush came out,
[55:11.980 --> 55:23.980]  there was also like Diablo Skywalker, SFV, Tahoe, you know, and then there was stuff like so that I think the Hollywood and the ghost and the Joss Deer all the same.
[55:23.980 --> 55:32.980]  But there was several other OG cuts, the kosher, you know, the Jews gold cut of the kosher.
[55:32.980 --> 55:38.980]  But but yeah, I mean, so with all these different ones, you know, some of them were sweet.
[55:38.980 --> 55:44.980]  Some of them lean towards pine. Some of them were super fuel heavy and some of them were very similar.
[55:44.980 --> 55:51.980]  I always lean towards the SFV back in the day. I love that SFV cut besides the original OG, which we also had as headband.
[55:51.980 --> 56:00.980]  But that's you know, I've talked about that on my show a little bit, but definitely like that SFV was the one that there was pine in it.
[56:00.980 --> 56:04.980]  There was gas. There was the limonene, that lime lemon taste.
[56:04.980 --> 56:11.980]  But it was the balanced one. And it was the one that like would get you if you weren't used to smoking it, it would get you really fucked up.
[56:11.980 --> 56:14.980]  But if you're used to smoking it, it would get you to where you want to be.
[56:14.980 --> 56:17.980]  If you want to leave the house and you're cool, you could leave now and be good.
[56:17.980 --> 56:21.980]  You know, that taste in your mouth. You know, I get it.
[56:21.980 --> 56:24.980]  So what are you looking for?
[56:24.980 --> 56:29.980]  You want to describe your favorite OG. Is it more on the sweet with the lime?
[56:29.980 --> 56:35.980]  Yes, absolutely. That's been mine. And that's why, honestly, I'm not biased to my strength.
[56:35.980 --> 56:41.980]  I just it has that. And it's like as I tell everyone, find me something better and just bring it to me and you're good.
[56:41.980 --> 56:44.980]  You're golden. Like I'll get it. Don't worry. Just find it.
[56:44.980 --> 56:49.980]  You know, but I'm actually I'm not too impressed often. You know, I'm not too impressed.
[56:49.980 --> 56:55.980]  I'm actually just get humbled more and more every time because it's like I'm super lucky to have that access.
[56:55.980 --> 56:58.980]  It's I'm humbled by that for sure.
[56:58.980 --> 57:02.980]  Yeah, we've been fortunate to be able to be picky.
[57:02.980 --> 57:11.980]  And and also I think how you become picky in an authentic way, it takes lots of years of experience of trying different things.
[57:11.980 --> 57:13.980]  So you need these data points in your head of what's good and what's bad.
[57:14.980 --> 57:16.980]  If you've never tried the bad stuff, you've only tried good stuff.
[57:16.980 --> 57:20.980]  You haven't really experienced it all to really appreciate why the good stuff is so good.
[57:20.980 --> 57:26.980]  You know, and it's like so you need to smoke a lot of good weed to understand what's really good about it.
[57:26.980 --> 57:30.980]  Besides just the effect of the taste, all those things makes you feel better.
[57:30.980 --> 57:35.980]  I mean, I think that's where a lot of people are missing because there's so much mediocre cannabis out there.
[57:35.980 --> 57:39.980]  L.A., San Francisco, everywhere. It's not just it's not.
[57:39.980 --> 57:43.980]  Yeah, it's from our time. I honestly expect like imagine this, James.
[57:43.980 --> 57:49.980]  If people were consistently working from when we started doing it with the passion and heart and I mean, I'm like, don't get it wrong.
[57:49.980 --> 57:52.980]  Some of these guys are passionate and they're driven like that.
[57:52.980 --> 57:56.980]  But it's blurred.
[57:56.980 --> 57:58.980]  There's a lot of corporate infiltration, bro.
[57:58.980 --> 58:03.980]  That isn't like us freaking out on our own without these big people and us having to figure it out.
[58:04.980 --> 58:11.980]  From the bottom up, all the failing, winning, like you get to appreciate the level that we're at.
[58:11.980 --> 58:15.980]  You know what I mean? These guys are like they're not getting that.
[58:15.980 --> 58:18.980]  They're just they're looking at it in a different way. They're looking at it in a different way.
[58:18.980 --> 58:22.980]  Like I feel that right now.
[58:22.980 --> 58:27.980]  Yes, we've only smoked a little bit of this joint.
[58:27.980 --> 58:30.980]  We haven't smoked a lot, but the effect is profound.
[58:30.980 --> 58:34.980]  It's a good, good, strong. Yeah, it gets you there.
[58:34.980 --> 58:37.980]  It's heady. It's heady. It's not super racy, though, right?
[58:37.980 --> 58:39.980]  No, no, no, no. It's just here.
[58:39.980 --> 58:41.980]  It's not like I was in the press too much.
[58:41.980 --> 58:44.980]  Yeah, well, it's land-raised. It's not like we're familiar. It's musky.
[58:44.980 --> 58:47.980]  So to describe the taste, it's got.
[58:47.980 --> 58:52.980]  It's not sweet. It has a little bit of spice in it.
[58:52.980 --> 58:57.980]  Let me smell it and give you guys a little.
[58:57.980 --> 59:01.980]  So when I like really getting in there, when I'm squeezing them and smelling it.
[59:01.980 --> 59:05.980]  But yeah, it has a little bit of.
[59:05.980 --> 59:11.980]  Let's see. So to me, this really smells good once you squeeze it in there.
[59:11.980 --> 59:15.980]  But I smell like a muskiness. I smell a little cedar.
[59:15.980 --> 59:17.980]  You're getting some cedar, like some wood.
[59:17.980 --> 59:20.980]  That's the smell. I couldn't put my feet on the seat.
[59:20.980 --> 59:22.980]  Yeah, it's got cedar like a sauna.
[59:22.980 --> 59:25.980]  If you're used to doing sauna, sauna, sauna, I'm finished.
[59:25.980 --> 59:30.980]  So we say sauna. But yeah, it's cedar and you got musk.
[59:30.980 --> 59:35.980]  It smells earthy. But the effect from it, you know, if you're going for effect,
[59:35.980 --> 59:39.980]  this might be the one you would want to smoke.
[59:39.980 --> 59:44.980]  You know, it's not your typical gas-drained variety or gelato or cookie.
[59:44.980 --> 59:49.980]  It's something a little bit older that, you know, it's a great daytime weed for me, I think.
[59:49.980 --> 59:53.980]  It's subtle. It's subtle. You feel it up in the head.
[59:53.980 --> 59:57.980]  It doesn't make your eyes too tight.
[59:57.980 --> 01:00:00.980]  But yeah, so that's what we just described.
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:02.980]  All those different properties, bro, is exactly it.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:06.980]  It doesn't make your eyes too low. You feel it in the head, not too body.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:08.980]  The taste, it's okay. It's not too bad.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.980]  But, you know, but the eye's not too low, but I feel it in the head.
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:17.980]  That's, yeah, it's good. I like that.
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:18.980]  Interesting.
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:23.980]  Yeah, so let's talk about different – we've been talking about OG.
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.980]  We've been talking about LA.
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:33.980]  Let's talk about cookies and gelato and kind of their progress.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.980]  What's your experience with cookies?
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:40.980]  I know we were smoking – you know, back in 2012, we were definitely smoking cookies together.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:41.980]  Right.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:44.980]  So I was a huge – I grew a lot of cookies back then.
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.980]  I love sharing. We've smoked lots of joints together.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.980]  The cookies, I mean –
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:55.980]  You know what, like I'm going to tell you, I love my OGs, bro.
[01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:58.980]  I love my OGs. I don't smoke too much cookies.
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:03.980]  I mean, yours is – all your strains that you show me, come on, yours are always like superb.
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.980]  You grow it really well, bro. You know what you're doing.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:07.980]  That matters too, you know what I mean?
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:11.980]  But I am after those Fuele Lemon vanilla undertones and stuff.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.980]  I'm after those, man. And it's like –
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:16.980]  So purple really doesn't matter to you?
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:17.980]  Nope.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:20.980]  I love it. I love it. Yeah, we're on such a purple kick.
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:25.980]  To be considered exotic, you've got to have purple right now.
[01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:28.980]  And five years ago, it was like nobody wanted purple.
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.980]  We're back in that purple swing. Gelato has come back.
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.980]  People don't know that.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.980]  People don't know that it was back in the day.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:36.980]  Like they don't know that. They're experiencing it now.
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:40.980]  And I mean it's different from what was back a little bit, but it was good back then too.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:42.980]  It's right there.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:44.980]  Sorry about that.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:50.980]  Yeah, so extract. Let's go into like extract and varieties.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:54.980]  As far as extract, what do you like? You like OGs as well pretty much?
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.980]  He's just an L.A. guy.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:59.980]  I'm just an OG on my OGs.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:00.980]  He's just an OG, seriously.
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.980]  I just love my – I mean I just – I'm sorry.
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:06.980]  Don't get me wrong. There's like – the gelatos are good once in a while.
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.980]  But see, once I smoke these different strains and I go back to that one,
[01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.980]  I really appreciate it even more.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:15.980]  I really – I mean you guys bring me something.
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.980]  I'm looking for the next best thing. Bring it. I'm waiting.
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:20.980]  I know you guys think you got it.
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:24.980]  Give me a holler. You know what I mean?
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:26.980]  See what we can do with it.
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:31.980]  So for breeding projects in the future, you know, we kind of talked about breeding together
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:32.980]  and doing some stuff.
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:37.980]  What do you see as the future of cannabis, at least the breeding directions that you would like to go?
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:41.980]  The breeding directions that I would like to go.
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:45.980]  Because you love OG, but you want to incorporate OG into –
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.980]  Yeah, I mean I would like to incorporate –
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:49.980]  To incorporate my OG with like what I said with you.
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:54.980]  Maybe do something special like exclusive where we do cup winner with cup winners
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:58.980]  and we start venturing off with that and doing – just hybriding them.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.980]  You know, like just bringing in these properties, my favorite properties
[01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.980]  with your favorite properties that won the cups and let's see what happens.
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:06.980]  You know what I mean?
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:07.980]  That would be something to do.
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:11.980]  Just to fall back and do that even with the new strains, but to add to it,
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:14.980]  to add substance to it because of the awards and all that.
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:19.980]  I think it could create a buzz a little bit and just make people want to come out and try it.
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:21.980]  But I'm open-minded to all the new strains.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:25.980]  There's some good ones out there like a Gelato 41 with the Yoda 2 would be great too.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.980]  It's an interesting one too.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.980]  So I'm open-minded.
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:32.980]  As long as it's good and fire, I want to just make the next fire one.
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.980]  That's what we're after, the next best.
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.980]  We're open-minded and it's a process.
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:43.980]  Just flip those stones on, man, and make it happen.
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.980]  Yeah, I think one of the biggest things is patience.
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.980]  I think that's what a lot of people are short on is patience
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:53.980]  and understanding what it means to breed something as opposed to just create F1
[01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.980]  and find some phenos.
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:01.980]  Going through the process, I think being in America, being in the United States,
[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.980]  people are like they want it and it's popular.
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:07.980]  And then three months later, they're on to the next thing.
[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:11.980]  They're like barracudas in the ocean chasing shiny objects.
[01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:15.980]  The breeding process, which a lot of stuff takes,
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:22.980]  I feel like it's a multiple-year process a lot of times to do it right.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:28.980]  We can create F1s and we can create popular stuff, but isolating specific properties.
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.980]  I think one example that I can use is the skittles.
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.980]  We talked about the skittles.
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:37.980]  The first skittles that came out until just recently, I thought it was the best skittles.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:38.980]  I tried some crosses.
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:40.980]  Now people are really putting work in it.
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:44.980]  It took a long time for people to put good work and good stuff that I felt
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:46.980]  captured that terpene correctly.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.980]  We got some guys coming on the show from Canada Organics
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:52.980]  and my partner's in Canada Genics next week.
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:55.980]  We're going to be talking about pheno hunting.
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:05:02.980]  The skittles is a great example of something that came out that wasn't perfected,
[01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:04.980]  but it had that terpene profile.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:06.980]  The structure was terrible.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:07.980]  It doesn't grow very well.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.980]  It's very finicky.
[01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:13.980]  The bag of peel just isn't there, but man, that flavor is amazing.
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:17.980]  Then we smoked some of the stuff.
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.980]  It's a skittles creme rosé cross, then back on the skittles that these guys
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:25.980]  created up north that I'm partners with.
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:31.980]  It's like skittles times 10, if you could imagine that.
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:34.980]  What they did is they improved the structure and also improved the flavor.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:37.980]  By back-crossing it on the skittles and doing proper selections,
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.980]  using a decent size of plants to be able to select from.
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:43.980]  I'm not going to go too much into detail because we're definitely going to be
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:48.980]  talking about it next week, but I think really important stuff is to do actual
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:50.980]  breeding work.
[01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:54.980]  I'd love to see people going on and improving the genetics,
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:57.980]  not just creating F1s and finding phenos, but going,
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:59.980]  I like this terpene profile.
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:03.980]  I like this part about Tropicana cookies, but I want it to taste more like this.
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:04.980]  How are we going to take that?
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:06.980]  What are we going to cross it with?
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.980]  There's a lot of trial and error because I get all these really freaking
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:13.980]  creative ideas, and then I go in and try to execute them.
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.980]  Sometimes they're coming out similar to how you want,
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:18.980]  and other times I was way off the charts.
[01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:23.980]  It was a great idea on paper, but then you put Jack on anything,
[01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.980]  this is a very valuable breeding lesson, you put anything, Jack,
[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:30.980]  terpene, limonene, a lot of times, especially Jack,
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:34.980]  that's going to be dominant in the entire progeny of this stuff.
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:37.980]  If not, then you start back-crossing it, you're going to find it way down the
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:39.980]  line, you'll still find it popping up.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:44.980]  Adam Dunn jokes about you over-breed stuff and you cross too many things
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.980]  into it, it all ends up being Jack, and I think there's definitely truth
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:50.980]  to that.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:55.980]  Let's get back to talking with Master Yoda about,
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:57.980]  what should we talk about?
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:03.980]  Early on, Cannabis Cups, the people, they're like family.
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:08.980]  Master Yoda, we have a handful of our friends that all came up on those
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:12.980]  early cups from the very beginning.
[01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:13.980]  They were special.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:14.980]  It's kind of like disco, though.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.980]  It's like these great things that happened throughout history,
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:17.980]  it's been like that.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:19.980]  But great things happen and then they evolve and change.
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.980]  They still exist, but maybe they're not the same.
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:27.980]  How do you feel about those cups in the beginning?
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:28.980]  Life-changing.
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:36.980]  They really solidified a part of me and myself, and just being able to
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:46.980]  experience and be a part of going out and being able to share a common
[01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:51.980]  ground with the masses and share your passion at your booth or whatever.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:53.980]  We were dabbing, people remember that?
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:54.980]  We have lines of people.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.980]  Lines of people.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:00.980]  Nobody fighting.
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:01.980]  These events were huge.
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:02.980]  No one would fight.
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:04.980]  I think at one there was an argument or something.
[01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.980]  No one threw blows or nothing, but everyone's just happy.
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:10.980]  Just so diverse.
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:15.980]  Everyone just happy to be in a place where there's so many people with that
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.980]  commonality that it just made you happy, dude.
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:20.980]  And it just made you want to go.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:21.980]  We went to all of them, bro.
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:22.980]  It was like family.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:24.980]  Like we said, it became that.
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:26.980]  It was an awesome experience.
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:28.980]  I really, really miss those, to be honest with you.
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:33.980]  And just quickly, that's in stark contrast to our 2 p.m.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:36.980]  show today, which will be heavily trolled.
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:39.980]  Anyway, carry on.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:43.980]  Yeah, I mean, it was definitely life-changing for me as well.
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:45.980]  We had a lot of great experiences.
[01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:48.980]  Some of my good friends that I have today, if it wasn't for High Times
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.980]  Canvas Cups, I wouldn't be friends.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:51.980]  We probably wouldn't know each other.
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:52.980]  We wouldn't know each other.
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:53.980]  Absolutely not.
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:54.980]  Absolutely not.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:59.980]  There was something really authentic about High Times back in the day.
[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:02.980]  I don't care what you say about it now, but back in the day at those cups,
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:04.980]  it was our one opportunity.
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:07.980]  It was like this festival almost we would go to and be able to hang out
[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:09.980]  with like-minded people.
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.980]  And there's not a lot of times in your life once you find something that
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:14.980]  you're attached to and you're really passionate about,
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:17.980]  then it was so illegal too.
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:19.980]  We were taking risks going to this event,
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:23.980]  especially because we all had grows, and talking to other people.
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:25.980]  There was fucking weird-ass things that happened.
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:27.980]  There were snitches that tried to come on.
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:29.980]  The feds were in the stuff.
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:33.980]  But for the most part, I would say they left people be,
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:37.980]  and we got to smoke and hang out and learn about each other and learn about
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:39.980]  good weed and improving those data points.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:42.980]  When we're talking about data points, if you look at it mathematically,
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:46.980]  we're improving those data points by trying other people's good cannabis.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:49.980]  And a lot of people, that's where they smoke really good cannabis for the
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:53.980]  first time or really good extract.
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:10:02.980]  I had a DAB booth back in 2012 where we were the first at the Hemp Fest in
[01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.980]  Sacramento.
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:06.980]  Crazy, crazy times.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.980]  I met a lot of good friends there as well.
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:11.980]  It was that same kind of group that we were hanging out with.
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:18.980]  Like a vet for Mary from the Miss High Times back in the day.
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:25.980]  And Uncle Stoner and Master Bong, he's another great example.
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:27.980]  I miss all of that.
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.980]  It makes me sad right now with the whole COVID thing not all hanging out.
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.980]  It's changing even more with COVID.
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:35.980]  With the COVID, that's changed the world forever, man.
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:37.980]  We were at a cup when all this started unraveling too.
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:40.980]  You were out there too in Spain, right, last year or the beginning of this year.
[01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:43.980]  Yeah, literally I flew back March 13th, man.
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:45.980]  It's changed.
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:48.980]  I've had a fine year.
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:50.980]  The year has been great for me.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.980]  I'm happy.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.980]  I'm so blessed.
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:57.980]  And Marlon, being partners with Marlon and my friends, Marlon, I'm glad we're
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:00.980]  able to evolve into something else because music has been terrible.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.980]  The whole music scene was crushed by COVID.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:05.980]  Cannabis, we're blessed.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:07.980]  Cannabis, I feel like a lot of people in cannabis had a good year.
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:09.980]  Not everybody.
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:11.980]  We had fires.
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:13.980]  There were people that lost their homes, lost everything they had.
[01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.980]  But for the most part, as an industry, the cannabis industry has thrived.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:18.980]  Because what else are you going to do?
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:20.980]  You're locked in.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.980]  You're not locked in your house, but you're stuck at home.
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.980]  You're going to smoke weed, drink alcohol.
[01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.980]  Preferably smoke weed.
[01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:30.980]  Not that I don't like alcohol, but I feel like alcohol is bad for you and
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:32.980]  cannabis does nothing but good things for you.
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:34.980]  For sure.
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:43.830]  A little tripping right now.
[01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:46.830]  Let's be specific here.
[01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:48.830]  That's funny.
[01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:50.830]  Yeah.
[01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:52.830]  Oh, sure.
[01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:54.830]  Right there.
[01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:58.480]  So, yeah.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.480]  I mean, the industry is a really interesting place.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:05.680]  I mean, it's a really interesting place.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.680]  Yeah.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.680]  So, yeah.
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.680]  So, yeah.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.680]  So, yeah.
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:17.680]  So, you know, I mean, the industry is a really interesting thing, and the
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:21.680]  selection process, and, you know, it's like looking at someone like me from
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.680]  the Bay Area.
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.680]  I like a lot of stuff.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.680]  Cookies and gelato and Sunset Sherbert.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.680]  Love those strains.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:37.200]  love those varieties. They really put big beer and cannabis on the map. Man, I'm high.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.440]  Red Condolence.
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:46.560]  No one's noticed. No one in the chat has noticed. You guys haven't skipped a beat.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:47.200]  No, totally.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.200]  I like that it kind of hits you both at the same time.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:54.180]  Totally.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.600]  Good stuff. How about we answer some questions from the viewers? I'm sure they got some
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:00.960]  questions besides how high we are.
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.000]  I need to get more high, I guess. Fuck it. Let's see how far we could take it.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:12.800]  Break through that sound barrier. You guys are in the turbulence before you hit the sound barrier.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:22.320]  So yeah, I was thinking yesterday or tomorrow streaming just an all-day
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.040]  everybody watching me pack seeds up.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:32.080]  Since I have to go through that pain, I thought everybody could go through it.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.600]  Those ones are ugly.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:36.320]  I got me, bro.
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.800]  Let's queue up the questions.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.880]  It's got a creeper effect. There's not a lot of creeper weed these days either.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:46.880]  This stuff creeps.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:53.120]  Like, yeah, bro. It was very subtle. Like I said, heady, but don't bring your eyes like—
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.640]  The energy is closed out. So do we got the question here?
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:04.880]  We got the first one. Any good breeding strains high in eucalyptol and menthol?
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:10.800]  I don't know about strains that are high in eucalyptol and menthol. I can't think of any
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.600]  off the top of my head.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.640]  I'm not versed on that either, to be honest.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:22.720]  So actually, interestingly, we can talk about it here, but Rob, who's Seattle Chronic,
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:28.640]  had posted something about kind of at the end of his breeding process—
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:33.760]  Like, remember when you came down to LA and you gave Adam a whole bunch of bags of—
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:39.360]  It was basically the end of the phenohunting process, which is like, here's actual
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:45.360]  flour in a jar or a bag, and you open each one and you smell it and you're looking at the bud
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:51.840]  structure. So can you talk about that step in the breeding process, which is you flour out a bunch of—
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:57.760]  Yeah. I think we're going to be discussing next week too, but I think the phenohunting
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:04.560]  process is actually what we're discussing all next week. But as far as smelling, I mean,
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:10.480]  I think smelling and tasting— I've done huge phenohunts before where you've got to go through
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:16.480]  lots of jars, but jars this big, however big, the thing is, is like the way the plant looks when
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:24.320]  it's grown may not translate to the way it smells or tastes when you're smoking it. And same thing,
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:28.480]  you don't know the effect until you actually experience it or if it's going to get you high.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:38.320]  So I think smelling, coming in here, this is actually HOC. This is from Seattle. This is the
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:46.320]  Galactic Runtz No. 10. So Jason is going to talk more about this next week. Him and Ken Organics,
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:51.440]  we're going to be talking about phenohunting. But this Galactic Runtz right here, it's unique
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:56.080]  because it's not quite like all the other runts. I love it. But what I'm looking for is outliers
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:01.600]  that are standouts. You're looking for that 1%. So if you have 100 plants, you're looking for that
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:07.280]  1%. If you find 10%, you can narrow it down from there. And then you've got to grow them out again.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:14.000]  So I think what you want to do is, for the selection process, you're going through a room,
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  let's say you have 100 plants. You get some tags and you take about 10 tags in the beginning. You
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.840]  might even do 20 because you want to, in your first experience with it, take 20 tags, plant
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:30.560]  tags. You can take hook tags, whatever you want. And you're going to want to go around, smell all
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:35.600]  your plants. I would say go around first without tagging even, go around smelling every single one
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:39.840]  of the plants. Then the next day or a day later, come back, do it again and say, oh yeah, this is
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:45.840]  one that needs to get tagged. So you go through and you tag all your plants. And so from tagging
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.640]  the plants, then you slowly narrow it down as it finishes. And the stuff sometimes through the
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:56.720]  process at week six or seven may not be what, at week nine or 10 or however long you're taking it,
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:02.400]  may not be the same plant that you thought it was going to be as far as a winner, as far as that one
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:09.040]  outlier that's better than the rest. And if you, sometimes you won't find winners. It's like you
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:14.400]  think they're winners and then you grow them out, you flower them and then you take them and you
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:19.680]  dry them and cure them properly. And I say properly, because if you don't do it properly,
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:24.560]  you're not going to be able to tell the difference between the qualities. So you need to make sure
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.240]  not only are you growing quality, but you're also curing and drying and you're,
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:33.520]  you're smoking them and waiting until the end. So you can actually smell and taste those nuances.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:41.680]  Nuances are important with those outliers and going through that process, you, you can take as
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:46.240]  long as little, but the more time you spend doing it and revisiting those things, once they're cured
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.520]  properly, you'll really know the smell and the taste. Cause sometimes the plant looks incredible,
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.880]  right? Absolutely incredible. You got to dry it. And then it's missing the flavor.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:00.960]  And you end up with a purple punch where it's like, it tastes okay, but there's something missing.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:04.880]  I burn it. I want stuff that smokes good down to the roach. And the only way to do that is to smoke
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:10.400]  a joint, try it, smoke it, burn it, and take it all the way down to that roach and see if it still
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:17.040]  tastes good. You know, I think those are important things with the selection process, but then also
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:23.280]  growing a second time, because there could have been factors within that 70 day flowering cycle
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:28.720]  that you screwed up something, or you also sexual maturity as the plant gets older, it matures more.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:35.440]  And so how you do it from seed, you get structural changes with the way the plant branches
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.880]  with the clone version of the same seed. And then through that next generation of clones,
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.960]  you get more sexual stability. And within that sexual stability, I feel like terpenes can change
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:51.840]  structure's not going to change too much at that point, but definitely terpene profile. And it's
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:57.360]  not just terpenes, it's like flavonoids and certain things, you know, they're, they're
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:02.880]  saying the, the gases, some of that isn't even an actual terpene. It actually has to do with
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.880]  the chemical, there's a chemical exchange that happens that contributes to why the gas smells
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:15.280]  like that. And the gas that we're talking about is that, that burnt rubber and gas, fuel-y smell
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:22.320]  that, you know, I love that. So what else we got Peter? Well, all right. So when you guys were
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:30.160]  talking OG Kush, there was the age old debate of what the OG stands for. So can you guys clarify?
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:39.520]  OG and Snoop Dogg and B-Real, I'm pretty sure, you know, I, and you know what, this isn't,
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:46.080]  this isn't my, I'm not from LA and I'm not like, I would ask Josh D, but yeah, from what I heard,
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:50.640]  it was, it was OG. They just called it OG and it had to do with Snoop Dogg and B-Real.
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:00.080]  I've heard of them, but I've heard original gangsters.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:09.760]  So that's what I've heard. So original gangster from LA.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:16.160]  Yeah. We need to do a, yeah, we need to do an Origin show. You know, the guys from Florida
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:20.640]  and Josh D and everybody. I think you've done that before too, though. Right, Peter?
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:29.600]  Yeah. I think hopefully Josh wants to eventually do some stuff publicly again. He's taking a little
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:34.640]  time out. Yeah. Josh did a great job. The panel that we went to in,
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:42.240]  in where, where was that in LA? Townhouse. Venice Beach. Yeah. In Venice, which is where,
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:46.640]  Alpha, you train over there at Golds in Venice. Well, they actually closed because of COVID. So
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:51.440]  I'm training in Torrance at Powerhouse because that's the only gym open right now. So I drive
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:56.320]  out 40 miles there, 40 miles back three times a week. So you got to do what you got to do.
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:03.840]  Uh, all right. Let me, cause there are a bunch of questions. So,
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.680]  uh, someone at chat asked about tips for growing OGs.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:18.000]  Any, uh, grow tips, things to look out for. Do you like it dry or do you like it more humid?
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:24.240]  You feel like it performs better in a dry environment? More dry. Yeah, for sure. You?
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:29.760]  Yeah, I agree. I think the humidity needs to be lower on your OGs. I think OG Kush just in
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:35.040]  general is the most finicky fucking plant. And it's, it's, it was before cookies was finicky.
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:40.000]  And before some of these other varieties, OG was the first real finicky, you know, and I,
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  I basically used to give friends, friends, clones of OG and blue dream. If you'd never
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.840]  grown before I give you blue dream. And if you had experience and you want to go the connoisseur
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:54.800]  shit that we're smoking right now, I would give you a, some OG cuts and my friends frigging,
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:58.560]  they grew OG. Yeah. Some of them hated themselves, including myself. It's like
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:04.160]  you could overfeed it, underfeed it if it's just not happy. And then the clones didn't always root.
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:11.440]  So, you know, I think 50% success was what I had with our OG cut back in the day for the,
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:15.840]  for the clones rooting. And so I'd have to cut twice as many clones. Whereas blue dream,
[01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:19.920]  you can shit in the gallon or in the reservoir, you can literally shit and you get 2.2 pounds per
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:25.600]  thousand watt. OG Kush. I remember getting as low as like three quarters of a pound per thousand
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:33.040]  watt back in the day. But yeah, I would say low humidity is important. Keeping your, your
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:38.640]  parts per million of your nutrients, I would say somewhere in the middle, you know, it's depending
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.080]  on, you know, that has to do with what you're growing in there. Some of these guys really push
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:53.520]  it now. I've seen them thrive in both, to be honest, I'm being honest about that. You know
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:23:02.800]  what I mean? But you can go lower end. It's good. So you did used to do DWC.
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:09.920]  The LA cup with was the current culture set up the deepwater culture. But I've done everything.
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:15.520]  We're doing soil right now. Just cocoa, you know, you're on everything. Rockwool, whatever.
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:22.960]  Just yeah. It was my first experience with good water culture grown correctly.
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.720]  I remember seeing it from up here and these guys were pushing it from this grow shop and saying how
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:33.200]  great it was. And my friend got this system and it was, it was trash. He grew trash weed
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.160]  and it was the first time he'd grown it. So it's something that probably could have been
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:41.440]  perfected, but I was just like, this water culture stuff sucks. There's no turps. It looks
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:46.400]  good, but it's fucking garbage. And then this guy comes, this guy comes through with this
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.840]  insane weed. That's yeah. You were growing big plants too. And those, huh?
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:57.440]  It was amazing. Just big old root ball, you know, and feeling the whole bucket. It's crazy.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:02.320]  My first system would clog the pipes. So, but they updated stuff and no problems.
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:07.760]  But yeah, we're on that daily for sure. That was a good experience. I don't do that no more.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:12.080]  When I'm on the deep water culture, I was at the shop at the two buildings next door.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:16.160]  It was good. Good experience right there for sure.
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.920]  I settled down and we could get going again. Huh? Yeah.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.040]  So someone asked, are you Yoda from the forums?
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:30.160]  From, I guess, I don't know what forums.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.200]  Online forums back in the day.
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:38.240]  No, I didn't do online stuff really. I'm not too much on social media.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:41.520]  You know? Yeah. You kind of on the DL most of the time.
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:47.120]  I always been, you know, just, I'm not too savvy on that. You know, always working, doing everything.
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.640]  So. Your nose was always down and you were working all the time too.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.240]  More on hand in hand kind of. I don't know. I'm not in the digital world.
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:56.240]  Me and that don't vibe too much.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:06.480]  Al wanted to know why you called the Gelato 41 White Runtz juice box.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.840]  So the phenotypes with those, the juice, one name that I've been wanting to use for a long time, but
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:17.600]  the phenotypes with those, you're going to get some of the runts with that gelato. And
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:20.320]  really, I don't know if you remember juice boxes from when we were kids,
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:27.840]  that almost fake grapey, you know, grapey juice box taste in that smell. There's like
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:32.960]  the smell associated with it. And the first time that I smelled it, it was, that was the one,
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:38.480]  you know, and, and, uh, runs really carries that well. And gelato 41 compliments the runts.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:44.640]  And runs the, you know, I feel like those two are very complimentary to each other.
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:50.080]  Keeps the, as far as you were talking high THC, you're going to get high THC with those varieties.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:55.840]  And you're going to get that candy with the gelato. And, uh, so yeah, that's, you know,
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:01.040]  and you guys save some of these questions for next week. Cause we got, uh, Canagenics, the guys who
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:05.440]  did the work, my friend, Tim and Kyle from up in Seattle. They're going to come in. We're going to
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:11.360]  talk about crushing it with seeds and, you know, doing pheno hunts and selections, all those
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:16.400]  important things. We're going to definitely focus on next week. Are they going to be between two
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:21.280]  dead posters too? No, they're not. They're going to, they're going to be up in this little town
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:28.480]  called Squim, Washington, where it's 28 degrees every night. And, uh, it gets a nice warm 42
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:34.000]  degrees during the day or 45. I guess it was, it was 52 was the high when I was there this,
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.120]  this last week. But I paid them a visit and, uh, we were talking about pheno hunting and,
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:42.560]  you know, the future of breeding and some of our projects that we're going to be doing together.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:48.160]  And I visited a house of cultivar. I made two stops at my two favorite places in Washington,
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:55.680]  our house of cultivar and also Canada, Canada organics. And both guys have a great product.
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:01.920]  They have a very different product. Canada organics has a mixed light greenhouses and
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:07.680]  they have quite an operation going and their stuff is the turpey is to the turpey. Uh,
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.920]  it may not look, it doesn't have the best bag appeal necessarily, but that's not what it's
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:17.920]  about. It's about those turps in effect. And I just, I love smoking their weed. Same thing with
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:22.800]  house of cultivar and my friend Jason and Matt and the guys down there, they do a great job.
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:30.000]  Um, their stuff is grown in cocoa and they use a combination of different spectrums. And Jason is
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.040]  really, you know, with the guys, they've really dialed it in, uh, since I met them, you know,
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:39.440]  three years ago now, I guess. Uh, and they're, they're doing some, they're going to be releasing
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:44.880]  some ruts, phenos, uh, as well. Some interesting stuff that they've been. And Jason has gone
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:48.720]  through the selection process. So that's why I wanted them on the show next week is to go through
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:55.040]  that selection process, how he got to where he's got with the different varieties. Cause Jason is
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:00.080]  not necessarily selecting a lot of stuff he made. Although I think there's some, whereas Tim and
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:05.680]  Kyle, they're doing this selection process from all stuff that they've bred and come up with that
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:11.040]  we're releasing together. Long, long way about answering the juice box, but yeah, the juice boxes,
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:16.000]  it's cause of those juice boxes when we were kids. And then Al has a followup question.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:25.680]  Oh yeah. Sensi star. In fact, so I made, I made some Sensi star crosses a long time ago. And, uh,
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:29.200]  it's funny cause I didn't have a chance. I was going to give them to Luke from paradise.
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:33.840]  He is the one that made the Sensi star. And so I was going to give these crosses,
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.760]  purple Tangy crosses actually that I made with OG Steve's purple Tangy male that he gave me.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:45.120]  Um, I got some of those and some other Sensi star crosses and I didn't have enough to actually
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:49.600]  release, but I really wanted to share them with the guys from Sensi star. And I like Sensi star.
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:54.080]  It's not super relevant today of a strain, but I feel like that's one that could come back.
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:57.920]  Uh, at least, you know, it's nostalgic for a lot of us guys that are older.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.040]  Yeah. Sensi star is good stuff. Uh, you know, that was another, we were talking about power
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:08.320]  plant last night and that's one that I did not like back in the day. And I thought it was just
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:13.920]  some commercial bullshit strain. Um, when we got it, cause we got it, I got it at the third floor
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:19.280]  of the OCBC in Oakland where, where we used to go and I'd buy, I'd buy eighths, you know what I
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:22.720]  mean? And stuff I had like cat piss and I liked all this other stuff that I buy ounces of. But
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:27.120]  then when I go to the shops or I'd be in Oakland and I'd go to the, I'd go to the, I'd go to the
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:32.240]  I'd go to the dispensaries and buy different flower and I remember buying some power plant
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:37.680]  and it was like, this is the same shit as all the other shit that's, that's what I called European
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:44.160]  weed back in the day, which it is. It's definitely a European strain. And so I kind of thought power
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:50.320]  plant was garbage until just recently, maybe a year ago, someone came with a bag of some power
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:53.840]  plant and I'm like, Oh, power plant. I smell. I'm like, Oh, so it was just like back in the day.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:58.000]  And then we smoked some and I'm like, fuck, I actually really like this stuff. So in me,
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.160]  I'm kind of diverse. It's not just about, you know, any one variety. I like trying all kinds
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:08.000]  of different unique chirps. I'm always looking for stuff novel, but yeah, Sensi Star and power plant,
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:13.520]  good stuff. I feel like incorporating those with some of the new varieties or even taking,
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:18.960]  I think a good way to go is maybe get some TGA sub cool seeds, some of their fruit flavors and
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:23.200]  incorporating those. I feel like those are real complimentary with something like Sensi Star or
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:33.620]  power plant. Power plant was really orange and hairy. Oh yeah. It's trippy.
[01:30:36.730 --> 01:30:39.770]  Yeah. Unfortunately I'm reaching out.
[01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:46.010]  So this is that galactic ruts we're smoking on right now. Or is it, which one? Oh, that one.
[01:30:46.570 --> 01:30:47.370]  It's that one in there.
[01:30:48.730 --> 01:30:51.850]  So we have an auto flower question and dual root zone.
[01:30:53.130 --> 01:30:53.850]  Oh no, it's all good.
[01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:54.730]  Aquaponics.
[01:30:56.730 --> 01:30:57.370]  It's galactic.
[01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:06.330]  Yeah. Can auto flowers be grown in dual roots on a system?
[01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:15.850]  Dual roots on a system. I mean, I think auto flowers could be grown in any system. I've never
[01:31:15.850 --> 01:31:21.930]  done it. So I, yeah, I mean, auto flowers, you can pretty much put out of flowers. Anyway,
[01:31:21.930 --> 01:31:26.650]  the thing with auto flowers, you got to remember they have a small root zone. And so the biggest
[01:31:26.650 --> 01:31:34.490]  problem is over watering with auto flowers. I think a lot of photo period guys tend to over water.
[01:31:35.130 --> 01:31:39.610]  And other than that, I mean, if you're using any sort of water culture, anything like that,
[01:31:39.610 --> 01:31:47.450]  auto flowers are just fine. But it's something that you need to experiment with, with new,
[01:31:47.450 --> 01:31:52.570]  new mediums and stuff that definitely on water times, because they don't, they don't take up as
[01:31:52.570 --> 01:31:56.490]  much nutrient. Actually, they're going to ask their nutrient requirements are less, right?
[01:31:57.210 --> 01:32:01.850]  They're a little bit less. But the thing is, is like these auto flowers, you can push the nutrients
[01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:06.250]  to like, there's certain times where you see that they'll take more and then you push them,
[01:32:06.250 --> 01:32:11.610]  you know, a little heavier, especially with nitrogen. I think nitrogen is a really beneficial
[01:32:11.610 --> 01:32:15.930]  for autos. And the thing is, is like with photo period stuff, you wouldn't want to give additional
[01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:21.690]  nitrogen more than a normal amount of nitrogen in a flower cycle. Whereas you can run nitrogen
[01:32:22.410 --> 01:32:26.570]  full throughout flower if you wanted to, to keep your plants nice and healthy with autos.
[01:32:27.370 --> 01:32:31.290]  And then also where that comes into a huge benefit, if you're an outdoor farmer,
[01:32:31.290 --> 01:32:36.650]  you can actually take auto flowers, you can plant them in April and then veg your photo
[01:32:36.650 --> 01:32:41.370]  period out of buckets somewhere and transplant those in and still feed them that additional,
[01:32:41.370 --> 01:32:45.130]  you know, making sure they're, you know, if you're doing soil, if you're doing salt feeding or
[01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:50.810]  whatever you're doing, but nitrogen is okay. So it's one of those interesting things with auto
[01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:54.890]  flowers, they're very versatile and you can use them in a lot of ways that are beneficial. There's
[01:32:54.890 --> 01:33:00.330]  stuff we haven't even figured out about them yet. But I feel like the stuff we do know is pretty
[01:33:00.330 --> 01:33:05.690]  impressive, you know, companion planting with photo period, same thing with if you have a
[01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:09.450]  hundred gallon pot, you could plant them around the outside of that hundred gallon pot. You can
[01:33:09.450 --> 01:33:15.690]  plant like seven or eight autos. And then as those are finishing, you put your photo period in,
[01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:20.810]  and it's still vegging in, in, you know, July, you're still in the beginning of July, it's still
[01:33:20.810 --> 01:33:24.890]  vegging out. So it's not going to block the light from those autos. And then you can harvest the
[01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:29.450]  autos. And once you pull those autos out, your photo period is going to blow up. And then by
[01:33:29.450 --> 01:33:34.650]  September, you have a big ass photo period plant. And so you'll get two harvests out of that same
[01:33:34.650 --> 01:33:39.290]  plot that you normally would only get one without any sort of light deprivation or anything else.
[01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:44.970]  Okay, we have any Bubba Kush sightings?
[01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:50.490]  I'm in the bay, man. There's all kinds of dudes. I feel like there's a whole market of people that
[01:33:50.490 --> 01:33:56.970]  grow, you know, the Asian community definitely grows a lot of Bubba, you know, crushing Bubba.
[01:33:56.970 --> 01:34:01.930]  And they went from, I mean, I still think they're growing Bubba, but I think a lot of ice cream
[01:34:01.930 --> 01:34:07.370]  cake and gelato is not too but, but yeah, that, that Bubba, there's still Bubba around there,
[01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:13.530]  soapy Bubba. I'm not a big fan of Bubba smoke anymore. But I still like that pre 98. If you
[01:34:13.530 --> 01:34:16.970]  were to give me a bag of it, I'd roll a joint and smoke it and enjoy it.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.480]  All right, give me it. How's that hitting you guys?
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:27.920]  The second one is good, man. So this is the galactic runs. I really like the flavor on it.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:31.120]  It's really good. Definitely more flavorful. Yeah.
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:38.320]  Yeah, I got released. This is the this is Oh, we're smoking dessert runs. This is a different
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:45.680]  runs. This is dessert runs. Yeah, number 10. Number 11. I'm so high. I can't even read numbers.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:59.400]  So hypothetically, if if you had to pack up 600 little seed packs,
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:07.320]  would you put a little cotton in here or like rice grains or and rice grains or just the cotton?
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:11.160]  I mean, I have don't worry about rice grains, just put cotton in those for now. And then when
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:14.600]  we do this stuff in the future, I have little desiccant beads that we can use. I like putting
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:19.000]  desiccant beads with the cotton ball, but we'll figure out the packaging this next round to make
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:25.080]  it easier on you. So you don't have to use child labor. Thank you. Yes, Gemma is going to be very
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:30.840]  sad when I put her little fingers to work. It's funny because those little fingers with
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:40.040]  those centrifuge tubes were great. I I've been thinking the same thing. All right, let me.
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:47.880]  Okay, man, if you caught him out, we're getting cotton mouth from the galactic runs,
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:50.520]  whereas the Red Congolese didn't give me any cotton mouth.
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:54.600]  I feel it. Yeah, it's like behind the eyes. Yeah, for sure.
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:03.560]  Someone asked if you've done work with large scale seed companies.
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:09.000]  I have not. No, I have not. No, we were just talking about that. Actually,
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:15.320]  I think that's been a conversation we've had in the last day on, you know, moving forward,
[01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:19.880]  potentially with some breeding projects. So we'll see where that goes. And I think the big things
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:25.960]  for both of us was doing something authentic. We're both into doing a thing, not really talking
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:31.480]  about it before we do it. This is the exception. But I like doing stuff and then talking about it
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:35.320]  and showing I mean, there's been plenty of times in my past. My breeding book is an example. I
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:39.400]  said I'd have this breeding book out and we've had all these delays. It was my first project,
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:45.080]  so I didn't know anything about books and what it takes to take a breeding book, something like
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:51.960]  I've done and actually get it to market. It's all new. And so I should have probably waited
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:57.880]  on telling people so it was done. That's a perfect example of something I not really regret, but it's
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:03.400]  a learning experience that I've gone through. But yeah, as far as I think, definitely.
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:10.200]  Master Yoda's got the skills for pheno hunting and all that stuff. And, you know, having him be a
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:15.400]  part of stuff like that, his growing skills are amazing. And it's also because he's a connoisseur.
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:24.360]  And I feel like the best breeders are also really, really amazing growers. And you can tell by the
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.360]  flower, you know, if you were to go to Cubs and what these guys, if you go, you want to know who
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:34.040]  the best seed guys are, are the guys who have the jars of the best weed. You know, it's like Tommy,
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:40.040]  for example. So Duke Diamond, you know, he's always got jars of his fire. His stuff's always
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:44.120]  good. And his stuff is unique and chirpy. And that's, you know, it's like guys like that.
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:50.600]  But yeah, the best growers make the best breeders. And you can, I feel like someone said the other
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:55.560]  day that we guys can't grow anything but weed. But I feel like if you can grow good weed, you
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:08.450]  can grow anything. And most of us do. So genetic bottlenecking is the question.
[01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:16.130]  Genetic bottlenecking causing the modest yields in some of the constraints. I mean,
[01:38:17.730 --> 01:38:22.850]  I would say that I would... Or just talk genetic bottlenecking in general.
[01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:27.810]  Bottlenecking in general, too many varieties backcrossed upon itself.
[01:38:30.290 --> 01:38:36.130]  You know, I don't think that that's what caused, I think that OG was a bag seed. And it was
[01:38:36.130 --> 01:38:43.650]  something special. It was that one in a million, maybe even one in 10 million. It was the watery
[01:38:43.650 --> 01:38:49.890]  ticket. Whoever found that bag seed of OG, just like the bag seed of chem dog that chem dog found,
[01:38:51.010 --> 01:38:56.450]  just like so many other varieties, sour diesel was a bag seed. We talked about sour diesel.
[01:38:57.010 --> 01:39:02.370]  Those things, you know, you get what you get. And some of these outliers don't have... Skittles.
[01:39:03.330 --> 01:39:07.010]  I mean, whatever you say about how Skittles was bred, I don't know. But Skittles is an example
[01:39:07.010 --> 01:39:14.370]  of the outlier that's just special. It's like a lottery ticket. The odds are against you of
[01:39:14.370 --> 01:39:19.250]  finding those things. And then once you have them, it's not about the structure. Now, that's why
[01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:24.610]  people have bred... I mean, look at King Louie or Superman OG or some of these OGs that are gassy.
[01:39:24.610 --> 01:39:29.890]  These ones are these heavy yielders. People are pulling over three pounds per thousand off these.
[01:39:30.450 --> 01:39:38.050]  So I honestly think that it's not just bottleneck. It's just that it was a bag seed and it was the
[01:39:38.050 --> 01:39:44.450]  one and people kept it around. And timing is of the essence with that one. There's so many factors.
[01:39:45.570 --> 01:39:52.930]  But yeah, that's what I got to say about that. It's all I have to say about that.
[01:39:53.890 --> 01:40:03.050]  All right. I wish I could save comments so I can...
[01:40:06.810 --> 01:40:08.810]  Okay, here we go. Here's from the Discord.
[01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:20.580]  I would run the... Come on next week and ask that question, but I know exactly what they're
[01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:26.660]  going to tell you. So with those, I feel like the size and structure are similar.
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:30.820]  But all these varieties that are being released to the Loud Cannabin Janx brand,
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:37.540]  those all are going to finish around the same time, have similar nutrient requirements that
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:42.580]  are all going to be complementary to each other. Although I will tell you one thing,
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:49.460]  monocropping is the way to go. Unless you're going just for your personal self, but on a commercial
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:54.020]  scale, you always want to monocrop. I feel like one or at least in zones to where that entire
[01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:59.060]  zone is one variety. It's like mixing stuff up. You're going to take away from your yields for
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:03.940]  one thing if you're looking at it from a commercial scale, but you're also going to be optimizing the
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:07.620]  environment and everything for one of the varieties. If you have multiple varieties,
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:12.100]  that may not work together really well. So monocropping is key.
[01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:15.380]  No, I did not.
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:18.340]  He knows all about the NVK.
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:20.740]  I actually have that straight. That's the one I just told you.
[01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:26.420]  I grow that and the Yoda. Those are the OGs I'm growing right now, but no, I didn't create that
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:26.900]  one.
[01:41:26.900 --> 01:41:30.180]  Yeah, and then Jungle Boys did some breeding with that one. They incorporated a lot of their
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:33.940]  varieties. The TK and the NVK.
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:39.860]  Masonic is pre-gaming for the 2PM heckle.
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:48.180]  Yeah, we got to get Masonic on here. I would love to do a Masonic interview.
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:50.660]  Well, Masonic, what say you?
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:53.460]  Maybe two weeks from now.
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:02.100]  Yeah, my head hurts thinking about 2 o'clock. It's going to turn into the Jerry Springer show.
[01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:12.430]  I'm just scrolling, throwing stuff as I scroll past it.
[01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:19.330]  Yeah, Lifter is good. There's nothing wrong with Lifter.
[01:42:19.730 --> 01:42:23.730]  Delta 8. Let's talk about Delta 8 for a little bit. It's my new favorite cannabinoid.
[01:42:25.410 --> 01:42:30.290]  I'm not sure if you're all aware of Delta 8. It's most of the Delta 8 on the market that's
[01:42:30.290 --> 01:42:31.970]  either in isolate or disolate form.
[01:42:35.250 --> 01:42:38.530]  Yes. Sorry, yes.
[01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:43.490]  Can we get a unanimous yes vote on that?
[01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:47.890]  I think both of you should be naked. You could both be naked in your seats.
[01:42:49.570 --> 01:42:55.650]  I don't want to get deleted off Facebook or Instagram or YouTube.
[01:42:59.410 --> 01:43:00.370]  What were we talking about?
[01:43:01.730 --> 01:43:02.690]  Delta 8.
[01:43:02.690 --> 01:43:08.050]  Delta 8. The effect of Delta 8 is probably about a third as psychoactive as Delta 9 THC.
[01:43:09.650 --> 01:43:16.850]  It's like the difference of CBD and THC, but it's definitely more towards the CBD Delta 9 high than
[01:43:16.850 --> 01:43:22.050]  you would. I feel like if you took CBD and Delta 9, it's somewhere in the middle of there, but
[01:43:22.050 --> 01:43:27.970]  Delta 8 is really relaxing. I have this Oura ring. I don't know if you guys are familiar with the
[01:43:27.970 --> 01:43:32.530]  Oura ring, but check this out. If you look it up online, O-U-R-A ring. What that does is that
[01:43:32.530 --> 01:43:40.450]  gives me data points on my phone to compare different things that I try out. If I eat too
[01:43:40.450 --> 01:43:45.090]  late before I go to bed and I look at the next day, I can tell that I probably shouldn't eat
[01:43:45.090 --> 01:43:50.530]  because my heart rate was elevated or I woke up several times during the night. With Delta 9,
[01:43:50.530 --> 01:43:56.210]  what happens is my heart rate races and then it drops out six hours after I eat whatever I've
[01:43:56.210 --> 01:44:01.010]  eaten. If it's Delta 9, it drops six to eight hours later, whereas you want your heart rate
[01:44:01.010 --> 01:44:05.490]  to drop early on in your sleep. Then there's a lot of time where I'm laying in bed and it takes
[01:44:05.490 --> 01:44:08.930]  me a long time to go to sleep. I'm one of those people with edibles. That's how they affect me.
[01:44:09.570 --> 01:44:14.050]  Whereas Delta 8 makes me relax and I fall asleep within 10, 15 minutes.
[01:44:15.170 --> 01:44:23.170]  Super, super relaxing. I feel like Delta 8 is derived typically from ... There's a conversion
[01:44:23.170 --> 01:44:29.970]  process that they figured out how to do using CBD. You can actually make from Delta 9 or CBD
[01:44:29.970 --> 01:44:35.730]  using enzymes. They're producing it. It's getting on the market. If you haven't seen it yet or try,
[01:44:35.730 --> 01:44:43.330]  you can look for it. I think Delta 8 has a huge future. For people that are not comfortable with
[01:44:43.330 --> 01:44:49.810]  edibles, they don't even like five milligrams of a Delta 9, Delta 8 is for you. I start with 25
[01:44:49.810 --> 01:44:54.130]  milligrams for myself. That's all relative to what you're looking for as far as effect.
[01:44:54.690 --> 01:45:02.290]  For the naked Masonic interview, someone said we could start a fans only-
[01:45:02.290 --> 01:45:05.810]  Only fans. Oh, God. We're going this route.
[01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:06.610]  ... pay-per-view.
[01:45:06.610 --> 01:45:07.410]  Pay-per-view.
[01:45:12.210 --> 01:45:13.890]  What's high end?
[01:45:16.210 --> 01:45:20.450]  I think that as far as ... I'm not sure about strains specifically. Most of this comes
[01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:21.650]  through a conversion process.
[01:45:21.650 --> 01:45:22.850]  Conversion process, right. Okay.
[01:45:23.170 --> 01:45:28.610]  The conversion process using CBD, a lot of it ... The reason it's legal is because it's
[01:45:28.610 --> 01:45:33.010]  derived from hemp. I think there's a lawsuit right now going on with the federal government
[01:45:33.010 --> 01:45:41.890]  who ... Or whoever just made a ... FDA or whatever made a statement about Delta 8 not being okay.
[01:45:41.890 --> 01:45:46.930]  Then there's this lawsuit. What happens with Delta 8 is Delta 8 is a conversion process.
[01:45:47.010 --> 01:45:56.610]  It's derived from CBD. It's hemp derived from stuff that had 0.3% Delta 9 THC. I think that
[01:45:56.610 --> 01:46:01.250]  that battle should be won in court hopefully. It's a hemp process. It's also found in hemp
[01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:08.370]  varieties, the Lifter, stuff like that. I think it's a real interesting cannabinoid.
[01:46:08.370 --> 01:46:13.410]  I think medically ... I have ulcerative colitis. That's another thing I've talked about. I think
[01:46:13.410 --> 01:46:16.770]  medically Delta 8 is a great thing for your digestive tract.
[01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:19.810]  I take the THCA and the Delta 8 nightly.
[01:46:23.150 --> 01:46:31.430]  Got it. What are you guys going to roll up next?
[01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:34.150]  I don't know.
[01:46:34.150 --> 01:46:34.230]  I don't know.
[01:46:34.230 --> 01:46:37.750]  I don't think we've got enough. Is it the scale of that or ...
[01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:38.630]  You know what we got right here?
[01:46:38.630 --> 01:46:39.110]  We've got one.
[01:46:39.110 --> 01:46:45.190]  Here, check this out. We got it all tied up. We got these ... I think I got a lot of slack for
[01:46:45.190 --> 01:46:53.110]  these $200 pre-rolls. I was given this $200 pre-roll. These are worth every penny. I feel
[01:46:53.110 --> 01:46:56.950]  like the market demands what the market demands. Whatever people are willing to pay for stuff,
[01:46:56.950 --> 01:47:05.670]  they're willing to pay for stuff. This one, for instance, is two grams of fly with half a gram of
[01:47:06.630 --> 01:47:11.590]  a golden ... What is this? Yeah. Golden mix live resin or live rosin.
[01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:18.070]  Whatever they're worth, they're worth. They're really high quality. I think they're rolled
[01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:24.630]  perfectly. You don't see any of the extract burning the outside. He's using the live resin.
[01:47:24.630 --> 01:47:29.670]  He's basically putting it in the middle, capturing it perfectly in there. We're about to fire one up.
[01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:32.950]  I haven't smoked in four days. We're going to see how it tastes. I guarantee you,
[01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:41.500]  it's still going to taste terpy. I'm smoking it first because I want to make sure before I give
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:49.180]  it to Master Yoda. It doesn't taste like ass. The thing is, I figured this is really going to get
[01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:58.440]  us lit because we're stepping it up with that live resin in there. Oh, yeah. That was the other one.
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:05.000]  This one that we're smoking on right now is the 41 times Gusher with the bleach wedding
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:12.760]  or beach wedding. Sorry. Nick is still unconvinced. How can that be worth every penny?
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:17.400]  Can you walk them through? I'm not saying that it's worth every penny to you,
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:22.520]  but if it's worth every penny to the next guy, it's worth whatever it's worth. That's what things
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:26.120]  are worth. They're worth whatever somebody is willing to pay for them. To be clear, you didn't
[01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:31.640]  have to pay $200 for this. I did not. I have a good friend, my friend Em, hooked me up.
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:41.960]  Yeah, these are all tied up. A-L-L-T-H-A-I-D up on Instagram. He's collaborating with a lot of big
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:49.160]  guys. He just can't keep up with orders, I'm sure. They're super hard to find. As far as flavor,
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:51.800]  what do you think of that flavor? Really good. Good.
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.960]  Yeah. Really good, right?
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:49:00.200]  No, absolutely. That one really consistent. You've been smoking that for two days for it to taste
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:07.720]  like that. That's fire. That's fire, for sure. That's high quality. No question.
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:11.640]  What was that one? What was the strain on that one?
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:20.840]  That was 41 times Gushers with Peach Wedding. It tastes super turpy. It hits on all the levels.
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:25.640]  You get the gas. You're definitely getting some floral to it. It's got some lavender,
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:31.640]  floral character in it. You got that gelato as well. You're getting the creamy gelato
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:34.760]  with some additional gas and some lavender with it.
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:41.720]  Big thumbs up. It's going to get you high as fuck. Those things are just so strong.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:45.560]  That's why I've been smoking it for two days because they're so strong. I'll smoke them.
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:51.000]  Then you put them out just because if I'm by myself, even with a friend, I can smoke one
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.520]  no problem with a friend. I'll smoke half and just be toasted. Extremely medicated.
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:04.600]  Well, speaking of which, I'd like to go out to my garden and get high as fuck myself before
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:13.640]  the two o'clock show. You're going to need it. I know. It's like the whole Masonic crew
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:23.560]  is ready and waiting an hour early. You guys have any last ... Basically, next week is going
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:29.160]  to be Canagenics. Next week is going to be Canagenics and House of Cultivar.
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:36.040]  Basically, two Washington companies. We're doing a spotlight with these guys. We're going to discuss
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:40.120]  pheno hunting. It's going to be all about two hours of pheno hunting. We'll give a little bit
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:45.640]  background on the two companies and how we met and all the stuff with that. I really want to spend
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:49.800]  some time talking about pheno hunting. I think there's been some questions that I've gotten
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:56.200]  emailed. I'd love to just cover the process. I feel like we're going to get two different
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:51:02.840]  perspectives of stuff. The guys that are coming on from House of Cultivar, Jason, he's got a very
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:09.560]  special way of doing stuff. His palate is extremely refined as far as he's able to
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:16.360]  articulate the smells extremely well, smells and things on the palate and smoke. He's one of those
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:21.080]  guys like me where he'll just smell stuff for 20, 30 times and then pick it up a day later,
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:25.000]  keep smelling it. I just sit on my couch sometimes and I'm smelling different jars.
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:30.360]  He's very much the same way. Then we got the guys from Canna Organics,
[01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:38.920]  Tim and Kyle. Tim is a genius. He's just a really, really smart guy. He's got an interesting palate
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:45.640]  as well. He knows how to articulate good stuff. Then we got Kyle. Kyle is excited. He is extremely
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:52.680]  passionate. He's going to talk about different phenotypes of some of the stuff that we're
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:57.560]  releasing in seeds. Also, he's going to go into detail on the smells, the way they grow, the
[01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:02.920]  structure wise. He's really good at shooting off all that stuff. We had some good conversations
[01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:07.480]  over the last couple of days. I decided that we need to do a whole show on it.
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:10.440]  We can feature Washington. It should be a fun show.
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:18.120]  Yeah. I just in the chat told people, since everybody knows who we're going to be talking
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:24.280]  to and what the topic is, you can send questions to questions at dagadotlove. I just realized there
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:29.160]  was another breeding one that I'll forward to you from the Netherlands.
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:35.560]  Anyway, because it's another multi-paragraph question.
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:38.600]  Perfect. Send them away.
[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:47.720]  Okay. All right. Well, with that, let's wrap it up and get the popcorn out for two o'clock.
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:52.600]  Okay. I'll see you guys at two. Have a good one. Thanks for coming on the show, Master.
[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:55.640]  Appreciate it. Thank you guys.
[01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:59.800]  All right. See you guys.
