[00:07.360 --> 00:15.120]  Alright, welcome everyone. Thank you for waiting. Today we are talking with
[00:15.120 --> 00:23.640]  Kaya from Pacific Northwest Roots, that man right there. So with that I will pass
[00:23.640 --> 00:29.120]  it off to Josh to set him up.
[00:29.120 --> 00:39.640]  Let's blaze it up. Thanks everyone for tuning in. I've been waiting to get
[00:39.640 --> 00:43.680]  this guy into beans for a minute. I'm entirely impressed with everything he
[00:43.680 --> 00:49.240]  does. We met at the first Regen conference up in Canada. Drove up
[00:49.240 --> 00:52.600]  at 4 in the morning, came up to my place, hopped in the car and we just we
[00:52.600 --> 00:57.480]  rode out instantaneously and developed a cool friendship. And it's actually
[00:57.480 --> 01:01.360]  turned into a little business partnership. He's been processing my
[01:01.360 --> 01:06.600]  weed and turning it into beautiful hash. And fuck dude, you got skills all over
[01:06.600 --> 01:11.560]  the place. You're a beautiful hash maker, a beautiful seed maker. And yeah dude,
[01:11.560 --> 01:15.760]  we're stoked to have you on here man. Thank you. Thank you. Very nice of you to
[01:15.760 --> 01:22.560]  say so. If I could just shoot back, you know I heard Josh was doing
[01:22.560 --> 01:30.120]  works up in the Bellingham area where I went to college in the 90s. And you know
[01:30.120 --> 01:36.760]  I've always been a student of learning new methodologies. And you know he had
[01:36.760 --> 01:41.920]  been to the Living Soil Symposium and this was a new event, the regenerative
[01:41.920 --> 01:48.040]  regenerative farming stuff. And you know he had all the all the big hitters, you
[01:48.040 --> 01:51.480]  know amassed a whole bunch of really incredible knowledge and wisdom in the
[01:51.480 --> 01:58.240]  rooms. And so it was really really awesome to be a part of that and to be
[01:58.240 --> 02:01.200]  following along with your journey as well. And you know your farm up there is
[02:01.200 --> 02:05.000]  really cool. Josh, if you guys don't know Josh got a really awesome regenerative
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.560]  farm. And he's a one-man show so he's really putting in a lot of work. And you
[02:11.560 --> 02:15.880]  know when you put in that work and you get hands-on experience, you know you get
[02:15.880 --> 02:19.440]  to elevate to the next level. You know you're not just you're not just playing
[02:19.480 --> 02:22.760]  games. You're really actually out there in the field getting that experience and
[02:22.760 --> 02:28.040]  experience is the greatest teacher of all. So salute to you sir for for putting
[02:28.040 --> 02:31.160]  that on and getting that knowledge out into people's hands so that that folks
[02:31.160 --> 02:36.680]  can kind of follow along. Because really that's that's kind of what our what our
[02:36.680 --> 02:42.920]  whole vibes is. You know it's not about cannabis hype. It's about
[02:42.920 --> 02:48.560]  cannabis culture and it's about healing medicine. And when I say cannabis
[02:48.600 --> 02:51.640]  culture you know I think there's there's a lot of different aspects of cannabis
[02:51.640 --> 02:55.920]  culture. But you know for us it's it's really about the roots medicine and
[02:55.920 --> 03:02.040]  understanding that the herbs are sacrament and a great gift. And that
[03:02.040 --> 03:08.160]  we should be good stewards of the plant and advancing good genetics and being
[03:08.160 --> 03:11.600]  good stewards of the land. And you know being good people to one another and
[03:11.600 --> 03:15.480]  building community along the way. So it's it's all it's all an inclusive kind of
[03:15.480 --> 03:21.160]  thing and that's what roots is about. And you know we're honored to kind of be
[03:21.160 --> 03:25.280]  on on the show and to have people listening and tuning in and wanting to
[03:25.280 --> 03:30.280]  hear this message and wanting to connect with like-minded people that
[03:30.280 --> 03:35.680]  are on this kind of you know hortical mission. I want to shout out Dragonfly
[03:35.680 --> 03:39.640]  Earth Medicine, the Dempere family. You know there's a lot of farmers on the
[03:39.640 --> 03:44.840]  West Coast and around the world that are practicing awesome stuff. And you know
[03:44.840 --> 03:49.280]  you don't have to you don't have to have a lot of money you just have to
[03:49.280 --> 03:54.480]  have a sharp mind and a good heart to get on this mission. So anybody that's
[03:54.480 --> 03:59.640]  that's interested to learn more dig in deep. And you know as that relates to our
[03:59.640 --> 04:04.360]  seeds we're doing breeding in the backyard, breeding in greenhouses. We
[04:04.360 --> 04:09.440]  encourage folks that get our seeds to actually breed with them. And we've had
[04:09.440 --> 04:12.520]  some really really great stuff come of that especially with Green Source
[04:12.560 --> 04:17.680]  Gardens. Furthering some coffee lines and doing some great stuff. When you start
[04:17.680 --> 04:23.400]  to breed in your own climate regions your plants become you know acclimatized
[04:23.400 --> 04:27.600]  that you're making selections based off of things that work there. And then you
[04:27.600 --> 04:33.480]  can advance things and you know I get a lot of calls for seeds lately from
[04:33.480 --> 04:37.440]  big operations opening up throughout the country. And when they ask me for
[04:37.440 --> 04:40.840]  something very specific and I let them know right off the bat like that doesn't
[04:40.840 --> 04:46.080]  exist right now because you have to create it. You don't know exactly what's
[04:46.080 --> 04:48.960]  going to work in your environments out there so it's important to have good
[04:48.960 --> 04:53.280]  stock so that you can make breeding selections. And you know we believe that
[04:53.280 --> 04:59.280]  our seed stock is is supreme when it comes to that kind of stuff. You're
[04:59.280 --> 05:03.000]  going to be able to to work these lines if you want on your own or you're going
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.840]  to be able to pick through you know even on a 10 pack and find multiple keepers.
[05:07.840 --> 05:13.960]  You know and I've grown indoor my my you know my whole adult life so all this
[05:13.960 --> 05:19.840]  stuff is great gear indoors as well. But you know we really like to highlight the
[05:19.840 --> 05:26.600]  natural farming aspects of it and and really promote you know that that action
[05:26.600 --> 05:29.960]  from people who are using these seeds as well to get out there and get your seeds
[05:29.960 --> 05:34.240]  back in touch with you know the microbes in your area and and let them pass on
[05:34.360 --> 05:39.200]  that that kind of genetic information that is really vital to to plant health
[05:39.200 --> 05:47.850]  and you know human health same way. So I just went off on that one boy sorry.
[05:47.850 --> 05:53.530]  No that's cool dude. I am yeah I just like like want to highlight the you know
[05:53.530 --> 05:57.090]  the green source Nick. I don't know if he bought the pack or you gave him the pack
[05:57.090 --> 06:01.850]  but you know not a lot I don't know any other breeder out there that is like no
[06:01.850 --> 06:05.730]  no take mine and just go down the F generation do your own thing with it and
[06:05.730 --> 06:10.570]  and fucking do it man like it's your your confidence in what your work and
[06:10.570 --> 06:15.490]  your security and that is is really beautiful that you can just hey man do
[06:15.490 --> 06:19.690]  it your way and like it reminds me of dogs you know like we've talked a lot
[06:19.690 --> 06:24.570]  about dogs with Nick on here in German Shepherds and you know people aren't as
[06:24.570 --> 06:28.090]  hoarding on the you know like that sort of thing and I don't know I think it's
[06:28.090 --> 06:33.410]  cool man speaks to your character. Yeah that's that's the mission is to get it
[06:33.410 --> 06:37.730]  out there in people's hands and you know you know when I when I first started
[06:37.730 --> 06:43.410]  going out to Hawaii I've been with my wife a little over 10 years and you know
[06:43.410 --> 06:48.810]  when I go out there they had good herbs and stuff but I've seen a huge a huge
[06:48.810 --> 06:53.930]  shift out there in their knowledge base and in their genetics and now when I go
[06:53.930 --> 06:57.330]  out to this there's more good herbs and that's that's a win-win for everybody
[06:57.370 --> 07:02.370]  you know those guys are prospering from it so anything that benefits the farmer
[07:02.370 --> 07:07.210]  I'm for you know this world is a very big place and that myth of scarcity is
[07:07.210 --> 07:12.690]  has driven people to a fear-based decision-making process about hoarding
[07:12.690 --> 07:17.170]  things and protecting what's mine and you know give it away give your love
[07:17.170 --> 07:21.970]  away give your give your stuff away and you know actually the the seeds that Nick
[07:21.970 --> 07:27.330]  got those were those were gifted we took those down to to the Living Soil
[07:27.330 --> 07:33.130]  Symposium and you know just gave them out man we were really touched and at
[07:33.130 --> 07:38.690]  that conference Kelly had spoke and I remember you know there wasn't a dry eye
[07:38.690 --> 07:42.210]  in the place there's 300 people in that in that big meeting hall and everybody
[07:42.210 --> 07:46.690]  was crying and you know for me I had actually felt a little bit ashamed that
[07:46.690 --> 07:51.890]  I that I was trying to promote kind of what I was doing in a different you
[07:51.890 --> 07:57.250]  know I don't know and I kind of a hyping things up more you know and this
[07:57.250 --> 08:01.930]  was years ago and so you know we made a real conscious effort to to say hey you
[08:01.930 --> 08:05.130]  know we're not gonna try to take the fast track and be the loudest drum you
[08:05.130 --> 08:08.730]  know we're gonna we're gonna walk our our own path and just make sure that we
[08:08.730 --> 08:12.730]  got a firm foundation and you know we may not be the first ones you know in
[08:12.730 --> 08:17.130]  line or on the highest whatever you know but we're doing our thing and taking our
[08:17.130 --> 08:21.170]  time with it and enjoying the journey and and it's good to see other people
[08:21.970 --> 08:31.230]  you know doing well along the way with us so that's that's good stuff well hell
[08:31.230 --> 08:36.910]  yeah dude I mean I could I want to ask questions about you know other things
[08:36.910 --> 08:39.750]  like cash and stuff but I feel like we need to stay focused on genetics here a
[08:39.750 --> 08:46.590]  little bit yeah so this morning I think I think we're gonna talk about the copy
[08:46.590 --> 08:54.350]  and what you're doing yeah so just to set just to set the table for everyone
[08:54.350 --> 08:59.270]  he has a lot of lines and a lot of gear but we're gonna be short and sweet and
[08:59.270 --> 09:03.110]  concise today and just focus on the coffee and then we can come back in a
[09:03.110 --> 09:08.910]  couple days and hit the Yerba and maybe some other stuff so what we have
[09:08.910 --> 09:17.310]  available today is what I quickly and frantically inputted into the dagger dot
[09:17.310 --> 09:23.270]  love website which is about five different coffee products from the coffee
[09:23.270 --> 09:30.510]  lineup and then the kaya's selection which is a a mystery pack hand selected
[09:30.510 --> 09:37.030]  by kaya so that's what's available right now so I I think yeah talk about kind of
[09:37.030 --> 09:41.950]  what coffee is for you and then we can kind of go down the lineup yeah so uh
[09:41.950 --> 09:46.270]  you know and I also want to say you know we do a lot of testing on our gear we're
[09:46.270 --> 09:50.670]  running our gear in a lot of different scenarios and giving them to friends
[09:50.670 --> 09:54.070]  that are working stuff in different environments before we release them to
[09:54.070 --> 09:58.030]  the public in in most cases there's been times where we've released stuff
[09:58.030 --> 10:03.630]  untested but in most cases we're wanting to test it and and see the results of
[10:03.630 --> 10:06.750]  the work that we're doing and putting in without doing that you know you're
[10:06.750 --> 10:10.150]  really just I don't know you got to take care of it properly you know and
[10:10.150 --> 10:18.550]  learn from it so as it relates to coffee coffee is our flagship strain and the
[10:18.550 --> 10:22.830]  story of coffee I'm gonna give you kind of the the fastest way I can back in the
[10:22.830 --> 10:27.190]  the mid 90s I went to college up at Western Washington University and it's
[10:27.190 --> 10:30.950]  you know less than an hour away from the Canadian border and there was a lot of
[10:30.950 --> 10:34.670]  local weed around and a lot of weed coming down from Canada and we used to
[10:34.670 --> 10:38.350]  get this Afghani hash plant from some biker guys up there and it was it was
[10:38.350 --> 10:43.710]  ripper and had this incredible smell and it was you know top three all-time for
[10:43.710 --> 10:49.390]  me and when I lost that when I lost that connect post 9-11 because they'd shut
[10:49.390 --> 10:56.270]  down the border I just figured it was gone and then I got into breeding and I
[10:56.270 --> 11:03.830]  had some some Afghani plants that I was working with specifically alien og and
[11:03.990 --> 11:12.470]  alien kush alien og is Tahoe og crossed with alien technology and alien kush is
[11:12.470 --> 11:17.470]  Las Vegas purple kush crossed to alien technology and those were done by
[11:17.470 --> 11:22.150]  different breeders so I think Swerve was working the alien og and Rascal was
[11:22.150 --> 11:29.830]  working the the alien kush and my mentor had had passed me this alien kush male
[11:29.870 --> 11:39.070]  lemon hoko shout out lemon hoko and green bean seeds and so I I had set up
[11:39.070 --> 11:45.630]  this breeding room and you know I that alien og mom was beautiful and scored
[11:45.630 --> 11:49.270]  really high test numbers but it wasn't my favorite herbs but I knew it had
[11:49.270 --> 11:52.030]  Afghani lineage in it and I figured you know I'm gonna bang these two together
[11:52.030 --> 11:55.750]  and see if I can you know find some recessive stuff in there that because I
[11:55.750 --> 12:02.870]  really love the Afghani stuff and and so then when I did the test run from
[12:02.870 --> 12:07.350]  those there was I had ten females of that particular cross and they were all
[12:07.350 --> 12:12.190]  super frosty but the one when I cut it down immediately took me back to that
[12:12.190 --> 12:17.670]  Afghani hash plant that I was getting you know two decades earlier and it was
[12:17.670 --> 12:22.150]  just you know amazing stuff so I got it to revege I had a hundred plants in that
[12:22.150 --> 12:26.550]  test room I had 16 that I wanted to keep and there was only one that made it
[12:26.550 --> 12:31.270]  and it was that coffee and I've gotten better reveging since but you know it
[12:31.270 --> 12:35.430]  was a blessing and I prayed over it and it knew I wanted it to come through so
[12:35.430 --> 12:39.990]  that's that's our that's our flagship coffee and then you know as per I was
[12:39.990 --> 12:44.950]  taught from my mentor you know work your line so we were doing bat crossing and
[12:44.950 --> 12:50.110]  also filial generation breeding and in each of those breedings we could do some
[12:50.110 --> 12:53.710]  out crossing as well so we're really working the line and then just kind of
[12:53.710 --> 12:57.870]  throwing in the out crosses along the way to satisfy the market but you know
[12:57.870 --> 13:01.470]  in our mind our goal is really just to work those coffee lines so we've worked
[13:01.470 --> 13:06.470]  it out you know a couple F generations and this one is circled back now to the
[13:06.470 --> 13:11.910]  back cross for which is kind of the pinnacle I guess we might work it a
[13:11.910 --> 13:15.470]  little further but I think I might may stop there depending on on you know what
[13:15.470 --> 13:20.070]  we see in the in the outcomes from the progeny but so that's the menu that we
[13:20.070 --> 13:26.950]  working off the mail in this in this menu is Chia's coffee BX3 and we hit
[13:26.950 --> 13:31.790]  that back again to the original F1 Chia's coffee so that will give you the
[13:31.790 --> 13:38.950]  coffee cube we hit it to Avi's coffee or Avi Deco and that is what makes the
[13:38.950 --> 13:45.950]  Avi's coffee and if you don't know about Avi Deco, Avi Deco is a strain that came
[13:46.030 --> 13:52.750]  out of Israel it's part of their medical program I want to say it's it's a 20 22
[13:52.750 --> 13:58.470]  to 1 something like that it's serious medicine and it smells smells like
[13:58.470 --> 14:03.830]  onions like just rank super rank onions when you walk by it out in the field
[14:03.830 --> 14:09.470]  it's just it was unbelievable extremely crystal laden you know powerful medicine
[14:09.470 --> 14:13.990]  plant and we cross that to coffee and you know so this is this is gonna be if
[14:13.990 --> 14:19.470]  you if you buy a pack today you get this as your freebie and they come to
[14:19.470 --> 14:33.490]  open them up you get the little see a little sticker you'll also get the new
[14:33.490 --> 14:39.210]  big slap this is uh this is kind of the local upgrade that we've done for the
[14:39.210 --> 14:42.170]  hash brand here in Washington State in Washington State you can get our hash at
[14:42.170 --> 14:46.130]  recreational stores we have a we have a tier 3 farm here in Washington where we
[14:46.130 --> 14:55.050]  grow indoor outdoor greenhouse and wash all of our hash all single-source we did
[14:55.050 --> 14:59.330]  a harvested a whole bunch of stuff with Josh here and and wash that and that's
[14:59.330 --> 15:03.770]  been is out on the market currently as well you'll get this sticker here the
[15:03.770 --> 15:08.410]  worldwide roots by the way if you want to see some more of our menus you can go
[15:08.410 --> 15:12.930]  to worldwide roots at worldwide roots on Instagram and we have our menus there
[15:12.930 --> 15:19.050]  you also get this slap so you get all these slaps you get the whatever pack
[15:19.050 --> 15:25.290]  you order you'll get the Avi deco and then and then this is you guys haven't
[15:25.290 --> 15:32.250]  seen this is kind of what the whole there's the coffee cube and and then
[15:32.250 --> 15:37.710]  we're also running a special for you folks so if you so the one order is you
[15:37.710 --> 15:43.230]  pick whatever you want off the menu it's 200 you also get a free pack you're
[15:43.230 --> 15:47.590]  gonna get all the stickers include shipping you'll also get a root shirt
[15:47.590 --> 15:56.510]  and I got I got all sizes right now up to 3x so those will be available and
[15:56.510 --> 16:03.030]  then just to bring a price point down for folks that that maybe can't afford
[16:03.030 --> 16:07.110]  that but but are interested in having some roots gear today we're gonna offer
[16:07.230 --> 16:13.150]  for $100 Kai's pick and I'm just gonna go through my stuff and you know there's
[16:13.150 --> 16:17.430]  all kinds of all kinds of seeds I have in my stash and we'll make you up a seed
[16:17.430 --> 16:23.270]  kit and you'll get one kit and you'll also get all the stickers it'll come in
[16:23.270 --> 16:28.670]  the nice wooden box and everything and then and you'll get a shirt as well so
[16:28.670 --> 16:34.710]  yeah you guys want to talk about specific strains on on the menu there or
[16:34.710 --> 16:42.910]  did you have some questions talk more about yeah why not the flavor that's
[16:42.910 --> 16:49.960]  coming through on that coffee I mean where you know what other cultivars
[16:49.960 --> 16:58.320]  like well so so coffee is is for me coffee is is is a serious you know
[16:58.320 --> 17:04.240]  Afghani and it's got the ogs in it so you know like the f3s that generations
[17:04.240 --> 17:09.400]  were coming out a little more purple as we made our selections down the line but
[17:09.400 --> 17:14.720]  it's always carrying like a real heavy earth tone to it some of the females
[17:14.720 --> 17:20.040]  will have more of a spice I I select towards the the sweeter Afghani kind of
[17:20.040 --> 17:24.640]  chemi side of things that that that smell is what what what attracts me I
[17:24.640 --> 17:30.480]  like the sweet Afghanis in the hash it comes out really tasting like like
[17:30.480 --> 17:37.640]  caramel and there's also some hints of skunk in there from time to time
[17:37.880 --> 17:43.800]  smeller flavor profile it's both it translates very well so if you're into
[17:43.800 --> 17:49.840]  that earthy cushy og you know that's that's that's what the coffee is a very
[17:49.840 --> 17:57.120]  rich regal kind of smoke narcotic in effects so it's it's super heavy you
[17:57.120 --> 17:59.880]  know not and I wouldn't say there's a you know like chem 4 is kind of like a
[17:59.880 --> 18:02.760]  no ceiling weed where you can keep smoking it and get higher and higher and
[18:02.760 --> 18:08.480]  higher coffee is kind of like that but you know it's it's just so narcotic and
[18:08.480 --> 18:12.080]  heavy that you eventually you're just gonna you know cave in and go to sleep
[18:12.080 --> 18:17.200]  so it's a it's a real good heavy medicine and and we've crossed that into
[18:17.200 --> 18:22.080]  some other stuff that you know the freight train is a coffee crossed into
[18:22.080 --> 18:25.360]  the og ghost train Hayes which is a whole nother story we can get into that
[18:25.360 --> 18:33.300]  too but Peter did you have a question now just when you're ready to go down
[18:33.300 --> 18:39.580]  the line I can queue up the I think the first one I put in was coffee cubed
[18:39.580 --> 18:45.260]  yeah yeah let's talk about it a little bit so you were saying in in the F
[18:45.260 --> 18:54.670]  generation you you you kind of move to into the back working the back cross is
[18:54.670 --> 18:57.910]  what I've noticed just are you still continuing to F it or you are you kind
[18:57.910 --> 19:03.310]  of happy with where you're going in the back crosses so the whole the whole idea
[19:03.310 --> 19:07.990]  behind back crossing it really for me was was to get to like like true breeder
[19:07.990 --> 19:12.910]  stuff so that I could have stuff that would breed more true and not that I
[19:12.910 --> 19:16.510]  wasn't happy with the way that the F again stuff was breeding but you know I
[19:16.510 --> 19:23.310]  just really wanted to kind of solidify that that original f1 gene pool I you
[19:23.310 --> 19:28.910]  know I wanted to make it mostly like mom so but I've been really happy with
[19:28.910 --> 19:32.030]  the F generation selections and I think the F generation selections have made
[19:32.030 --> 19:38.230]  really excellent stuff more for flowers even and again you know we're working
[19:38.230 --> 19:42.310]  closely with with green source down there and doing some stuff and we're
[19:42.310 --> 19:47.190]  gonna release some really really cool stuff in the next year here so on that
[19:47.190 --> 19:52.510]  F gen stuff and and I've done things with lemon cocoa where we were passing
[19:52.510 --> 19:57.470]  back selections back and forth to so he selects an F to I select the F3 he
[19:57.470 --> 20:02.310]  selects the F4 and that's kind of fun you know I mean we all have different
[20:02.310 --> 20:06.350]  senses and different things that we're using to make our selections so when you
[20:06.350 --> 20:09.990]  can you know you got another smoker somebody that you really respect their
[20:09.990 --> 20:13.670]  opinion and they can pick good stuff it's kind of fun to pass things back and
[20:13.670 --> 20:19.870]  forth like that but but the BX thing was really about getting to more proper
[20:19.870 --> 20:23.550]  stuff for for breeding so that folks that were picking up the seeds and
[20:23.550 --> 20:29.110]  wanted to do breeding stuff could do that I ran a whole bunch of these coffee
[20:29.110 --> 20:34.590]  cubed in my backyard believe it or not it's it's it's it November 1st it's
[20:34.590 --> 20:39.790]  November 1st right November 1st I have still have a couple coffee plants out in
[20:39.790 --> 20:44.110]  my backyard that have been out no cover full season in Western Washington and
[20:44.110 --> 20:47.790]  and they're still ripping they're ripe I should probably cut them down now cuz I
[20:47.790 --> 20:51.190]  think it's gonna rain on Tuesday but you know they they handled the weather
[20:51.190 --> 20:56.230]  incredibly well so that's that's really exciting and I like to get those kind of
[20:56.230 --> 21:00.350]  tests in because that's just you know everything else was was messed up a
[21:00.350 --> 21:04.750]  month ago you know so that really tells you that there is some some incredibly
[21:04.750 --> 21:10.270]  resilient genes in these plants that really can handle that that that weather
[21:10.270 --> 21:14.670]  and the rain and the cold and you know those ones are not gonna have any
[21:14.670 --> 21:19.310]  problems with powdery mildew or botrytis and a lot of folks need that in
[21:19.310 --> 21:23.630]  their gardens to survive so that's that's the coffee cube it's it's a
[21:23.630 --> 21:31.070]  strong one I've washed variations of the BX and they're all dumping hash we had
[21:31.070 --> 21:36.190]  ran a mixed phenol deal up when I was up in Arlington at that spot and you know
[21:36.190 --> 21:39.710]  the hash came back I came with the scores were but it was it was stupid
[21:39.710 --> 21:52.870]  high so yeah the coffee BX is a great hash you as well yeah let me check out
[21:52.870 --> 21:57.390]  the comments are there any questions Dave's enthusiastic about the coffee
[21:57.390 --> 22:08.470]  cubes yeah yeah he's not here man so we can come back to this later but just
[22:08.550 --> 22:15.150]  keep this on the back burner we can talk about this a little bit later we have
[22:15.150 --> 22:21.430]  time okay okay talk about the freeze
[22:23.510 --> 22:33.670]  okay so I think any questions on the coffee cubes Vincent Thank You Vincent
[22:33.710 --> 22:43.190]  when did you uh when did you make this one um we made this one last year so I
[22:43.190 --> 22:51.350]  released this I released this I think we released it in January so we had made it
[22:51.350 --> 22:55.110]  actually probably last January January before that you know once once we make
[22:55.110 --> 22:59.790]  something it's generally about you know four four months at least before we
[22:59.790 --> 23:04.070]  release it you know because it takes you know once you pop a seed three
[23:04.070 --> 23:08.150]  months before you're able to harvest it and see it see a crop through and get
[23:08.150 --> 23:12.790]  some testing done on it to know if it's you know stable enough to release or not
[23:12.790 --> 23:18.070]  yeah and I'm actually pretty pretty low on those ones we're getting down there
[23:18.070 --> 23:22.350]  on them so but we you know again we're always breeding new stuff so I bred
[23:22.350 --> 23:28.430]  stuff out in the backyard this year with with the with the cube myself and and I
[23:28.430 --> 23:31.910]  don't want to spill the beans on what we have coming up but you know we're
[23:31.910 --> 23:40.380]  still working those lines what I didn't I know this is in the coffee line but
[23:40.380 --> 23:45.980]  what what is this yeah this is this is actually a picture it's one of my
[23:45.980 --> 23:50.100]  favorite pictures of coffee which is why I said it to you and this is from the
[23:50.100 --> 23:57.460]  guys out in in Colorado and and this one here I believe is the coffee f3 and
[23:57.620 --> 24:04.740]  we're gonna have some f6 from from my garden here to release next year and
[24:04.740 --> 24:10.340]  we're also going to have some f7s selections by green source and some
[24:10.340 --> 24:14.420]  other f generations that we're gonna be releasing next year as well but this is
[24:14.420 --> 24:20.060]  yeah this this stuff right here was was not naturally grown it was you know this
[24:20.060 --> 24:23.500]  is the hydroponic setup that they use but they do it they do it proper out
[24:23.500 --> 24:31.180]  there in Colorado and yeah Davis Davis smashing green dot labs I believe is the
[24:31.180 --> 24:37.900]  off-screen here green dot labs is the farm and yeah those guys are using
[24:37.900 --> 24:43.820]  synthetics to grow but man that's a beautiful plant holy cow Natalie has a
[24:43.820 --> 24:52.660]  question do you see that question is coffee anything like peanut butter
[24:52.660 --> 25:00.700]  breath you know we actually did a cross into the peanut butter breath nothing
[25:00.700 --> 25:07.060]  that ever made the menu but we we got it on the side I would say they're a little
[25:07.060 --> 25:12.940]  bit similar you know we've also done some breeding with with coffee and the
[25:12.940 --> 25:23.780]  ogkb and the ogkb is got that real again that carmely scotchy sweet Afghani
[25:23.780 --> 25:29.180]  you know there's hints of gas in there so it's definitely in that same family
[25:29.180 --> 25:34.420]  of you know of cultivars I mean that's that's kind of the if you're into that
[25:34.420 --> 25:39.100]  that smell and that effect then that's yeah definitely coffees on the same
[25:39.100 --> 25:42.900]  lines the peanut butter breath is also you know it's a heavy heavy hitter you
[25:42.900 --> 25:48.820]  know it's it's not a light sativa it's it's it's heavy weed and then you see
[25:48.820 --> 25:55.300]  lemon hokas question what's up now I'm so glad Mel's on here Mel I'm sorry I
[25:55.300 --> 25:59.700]  didn't call you back been crazy over here with getting this next hash drop
[25:59.700 --> 26:05.900]  out and Halloween with the kids so Mel was asking about the Starbucks so I had
[26:05.900 --> 26:13.020]  been gifted a cut of I don't know if I could say it gifted we made a deal and I
[26:13.020 --> 26:24.080]  got a cut of the Death Star from DBG dungeon vault kite what did we just lose
[26:24.080 --> 26:32.380]  you Josh you're still there right yeah I'm still here it looks like he froze
[26:32.380 --> 26:45.460]  oh there he's coming back now it's refreshing yep yeah you're back now so
[26:45.460 --> 26:51.740]  start start with the Starbucks again you were gifted something okay can you hear
[26:51.740 --> 26:58.700]  me I can hear you can you hear me now yep
[26:58.780 --> 27:06.180]  okay so dungeon vault genetics guy gifted me a cut of the Death Star the
[27:06.180 --> 27:16.280]  Ohio Death Star and it's one of my favorite OG's great plan and I crossed
[27:16.280 --> 27:25.800]  that to call and we released I want to say like maybe 140 packs he had taken 70
[27:25.800 --> 27:29.880]  and I taken 70 and somebody swiped my 70 at Emerald Cup and I never even got to
[27:29.880 --> 27:34.000]  release many of them I think I maybe got two packs that I had stashed and then
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.440]  our good friend two-tone Willie had selected a coffee f3 and this kind of it
[27:39.440 --> 27:43.080]  aside from the Starbucks but similar because there's a there's a strain out
[27:43.080 --> 27:46.880]  there called dirty Starbucks and that's actually bread with the coffee f3 which
[27:46.880 --> 27:51.600]  was selected by two-tone Willie and that was crossed into the chem double D from
[27:51.600 --> 27:55.720]  lemon hoco and that was all done by so good seeds and that one's a dirty
[27:55.720 --> 27:58.440]  Starbucks that's it that's another great strain I could send you some pictures of
[27:58.440 --> 28:03.160]  that one but I think that's what Mel wanted to hear about it's some some fire
[28:03.160 --> 28:23.850]  weed so Vincent when we ship out the orders we'll ask you what your shirt
[28:23.850 --> 28:28.650]  sizes are and what what are the shirt sizes and stop yeah yeah they definitely
[28:28.650 --> 28:31.410]  need that's the other thing I need is your shirt size so I've got small
[28:31.410 --> 28:41.130]  medium-large extra-large it's 2xl and 3xl while supplies last is there a way
[28:41.130 --> 28:44.890]  in in the comments you can make a comment when you're making a purchase
[28:44.890 --> 28:51.570]  through the site Peter to add that I will look to see if we can add that and
[28:51.570 --> 29:00.170]  if not we will when we ship them we will email you and get your shirt size before
[29:00.170 --> 29:18.060]  shipping Josh Josh needs his Excel so okay so sorry I'm just looking at the
[29:18.060 --> 29:33.180]  comments okay so next so we did we did the coffee cubed right yeah yes and is
[29:33.180 --> 29:51.580]  the Duck a bush D U C A or D U K a do you see K I've seen it spelled all three
[29:51.580 --> 30:22.620]  ways now good god Andre see the website scrolling at the bottom of the screen I
[30:22.620 --> 30:44.400]  will post it in the chat there he is okay so what is the what's the
[30:44.400 --> 31:02.970]  hammer hammer yeah I saw where that comment go yes any hammer hammer seeds
[31:02.970 --> 31:25.440]  oh wait yeah okay we can see you can you hear me Josh I can hear you guys and I
[31:25.440 --> 31:31.840]  can see you but I just can't okay so but this cool so the hammer hammer can
[31:31.840 --> 31:38.840]  you go yeah all right hammer hammer is nine pound hammer from Jinx proof who's
[31:38.840 --> 31:43.900]  super awesome local guy up here in Seattle does a lot of stuff for autistic
[31:43.900 --> 31:49.160]  awareness he's got an autistic son and nine pound hammers pretty famous strain
[31:49.160 --> 31:55.680]  one some high times cups power weed so we crossed that nine pound hammer to our
[31:55.680 --> 32:04.560]  platinum alien og which was the platinum og cross to our alien cush and she's my
[32:04.560 --> 32:09.480]  favorite plant in our garden right now I mean she just smashes everything in the
[32:09.480 --> 32:16.440]  greenhouse she finishes super fast big huge giant purple buds and and dumps
[32:16.440 --> 32:21.760]  ash like five and a half percent after squishing which is I mean that's that's
[32:21.760 --> 32:28.320]  just huge that's that's so huge so got a really nice og with a little bit of hint
[32:28.320 --> 32:33.600]  a lemon on it yeah it's a hammer hammer is probably my favorite hash right now
[32:33.600 --> 32:38.200]  you know a lot of folks are liking our strawberry yogurt and I know why I get
[32:38.200 --> 32:43.440]  it but I'm a little you know I don't like the sour beers either so I don't
[32:43.440 --> 32:52.280]  know I don't like the sour beer I like the I like the hammer hammer it's a little more
[32:52.280 --> 32:57.240]  powerful for me and yeah that's a good one
[32:57.240 --> 33:05.800]  and we have that available to I can add that all right I'll add that as well
[33:05.800 --> 33:11.840]  when we get off but it's not up right now oh you guys this is this is the
[33:11.840 --> 33:17.760]  hammer hammer no no no so listen the hammer hammer is sold out oh god I got
[33:17.760 --> 33:21.080]  it okay never mind you can find it if you could find it yeah if you could find
[33:21.080 --> 33:26.960]  it at a bank somewhere snatch it up but I'm sold out of him him ignore what I
[33:26.960 --> 33:33.760]  just said right but the duck of bush is the hammer hammer mom our selected
[33:33.760 --> 33:39.800]  hammer hammer keeper crossed with the coffee bx3 that's gonna be delicious man
[33:39.840 --> 33:44.720]  yeah so you got the nine pound hammer crossed with the platinum alien og and
[33:44.720 --> 33:52.230]  then hit with the coffee and that's the duck of bush and for those who are
[33:52.230 --> 33:55.790]  wondering what's what's hammer hammer hammer hammer is a river out here our
[33:55.790 --> 34:03.070]  farm is out on into who ya and these are all a lot of native native names and and
[34:03.070 --> 34:06.710]  out into who ya there's the waddle and then there's a right across the sound
[34:06.710 --> 34:10.230]  there there's a couple rivers that come down and the two rivers that come down
[34:10.230 --> 34:13.830]  over there they got great oysters is the duck of bush and the hammer hammer
[34:13.830 --> 34:18.550]  river so that's where that's what those names got you know the inspiration for
[34:18.550 --> 34:26.540]  those names came from and this is the duck of bush right that's that's
[34:26.540 --> 34:30.780]  actually the the hammer hammer the mom I was I was trying to get pictures of
[34:30.780 --> 34:36.180]  duck of bush this morning and couldn't get to him but yeah that's the mom it's
[34:36.180 --> 34:41.620]  a crazy plant fast finisher so those those duck of bushes are gonna come down
[34:41.980 --> 34:48.140]  indoors probably eight weeks you could maybe push it to nine outdoors you know
[34:48.140 --> 34:52.660]  we're running them in light depths so but they're the they're the fastest
[34:52.660 --> 34:55.860]  finisher that we have in the light depth you know the strawberries are taking a
[34:55.860 --> 34:59.580]  little bit longer coffees definitely want to go longer so if you're running
[34:59.580 --> 35:04.620]  the coffee cubed those guys are like nine ten weekers again I've got some
[35:04.620 --> 35:09.500]  outside here in Washington it's November 1st and they're just now done they can
[35:09.500 --> 35:13.580]  take that weather but they're you know the coffee cubed anything that's the
[35:13.580 --> 35:18.180]  pure coffee is gonna want to take you know nine ten weeks I like to take them
[35:18.180 --> 35:21.100]  to ten weeks I don't like to bring it down at nine honestly I like pushing
[35:21.100 --> 35:25.380]  them out a little further the terpenes develop a little better but the hammer
[35:25.380 --> 35:31.180]  hammer and the duck of bush that that branch of things is significantly faster
[35:31.180 --> 35:37.100]  there's that nine pound hammer by itself that mom that we have is a super fast
[35:37.100 --> 35:42.900]  strain as well it's one of the fastest finishing ones that we have for outdoor
[35:42.900 --> 35:48.540]  cultivation and indoors it's like a you know eight weeker maybe even 50 days so
[35:48.540 --> 35:55.460]  you know if you're if you're looking for that gas and in fuel and fire that's
[35:55.460 --> 35:59.700]  that's a that's a winner right there that's the one you all want it's gonna
[35:59.700 --> 36:05.100]  have a lot of good purple color on it
[36:05.980 --> 36:13.500]  Josh do you concur so is that what what did you guys wash of just on a tangent
[36:13.500 --> 36:21.460]  Josh what did you grow that uh that kaya then that you handed over the fence well
[36:21.460 --> 36:25.820]  it was it was really mixes because I was just my whole year I'm just running
[36:25.820 --> 36:30.700]  through seeds and selections and it was really kind of the year of the mail for
[36:30.700 --> 36:36.260]  me pulling a lot of males and females too but on the back end I did I did all
[36:36.260 --> 36:42.780]  my females by revegging and so I would just give in kaya like there were seeds
[36:42.780 --> 36:45.660]  in it and like I walked out to their field the other day and yet I'd seen
[36:45.660 --> 36:51.380]  that like all their fields are covered in the hash with the seeds in it and I
[36:51.380 --> 37:09.380]  fuck you you're gonna have a fucking party next year yeah we ran so off the
[37:09.380 --> 37:12.660]  top of my head my top of my head we ran some Ethiopian yeah from I thought
[37:12.660 --> 37:18.500]  foundation was that Ethiopian that was a cross it was Ethiopian crop no X cross I
[37:18.500 --> 37:23.420]  made last year is the Ethiopian cross the sky cutter Kush from Jackson mean
[37:23.420 --> 37:44.130]  gene okay and so I found it was some gelato's we can't hear you right now you
[37:44.130 --> 37:55.490]  there it's what happens when you have country boys on the internet so we can
[37:55.490 --> 38:02.890]  we're gonna go out of order cuz somebody just posted a comment so you
[38:02.890 --> 38:07.970]  want to talk about that and then let me queue up the comment sure
[38:07.970 --> 38:14.970]  Matterhorn fat rabbit yeah fat rabbit shout out fat rabbit this guy smashed it
[38:14.970 --> 38:23.450]  I actually sent you the picture from fat rabbit yeah so Matterhorn triangle Kush
[38:56.830 --> 39:01.550]  I got this cut via hopper my friend hopper and he got it from two-tone Willie and
[39:01.550 --> 39:23.070]  and so we cross that to coffee and came up with the Matterhorn and it is it throws big gigantic
[39:23.070 --> 39:26.710]  I sent him a whole bunch of seeds just on on GP cuz
[39:27.230 --> 39:31.750]  Listen man when you're smashing stuff and growing that good and send me some pictures back
[39:32.270 --> 39:36.070]  You know I really appreciate it because that's a that's quality work right there
[39:36.070 --> 39:38.690]  That's somebody who cares about their plants and knows how to grow them, right?
[39:41.460 --> 39:44.300]  So fat rabbit was this satisfying to grow
[39:49.620 --> 39:51.620]  Let's wait for fat rabbits, uh
[39:51.620 --> 40:04.490]  Thanks Mel
[40:05.130 --> 40:08.850]  Taco bird what's up? I?
[40:10.090 --> 40:31.640]  Love that I love how you can pop them. I can hear a baby screaming, and I'm like is that my kid someone else's kid
[40:34.200 --> 40:36.440]  No, no screaming babies at my place right now
[40:39.040 --> 40:46.840]  Natalie do you know Natalie where she is she up in in the northwest to
[40:47.800 --> 40:51.080]  No, I'm not. I'm not sure I've seen that name before but thank you. That's awesome
[40:51.440 --> 40:54.040]  You know we get we get reports from folks, it's really cool
[40:54.040 --> 41:00.040]  You know people are growing our herbs. I think pretty much on every continent. You know that that's out there where you can grow herbs
[41:00.960 --> 41:02.960]  Australia South America
[41:04.640 --> 41:07.840]  You know all over Europe I've sent stuff to Africa
[41:09.880 --> 41:16.360]  Hawaii and and folks growing it in different different climate zones and
[41:17.240 --> 41:19.240]  microclimates
[41:19.240 --> 41:25.160]  And it's it's really cool. I really appreciate it when folks hit me up. You know I try to make myself really available to people
[41:27.200 --> 41:28.640]  And
[41:28.640 --> 41:32.640]  I appreciate feedback so when people tell me hey this did this here, and this did that there
[41:32.640 --> 41:35.120]  You know that's that's all information that I can use
[41:35.920 --> 41:39.920]  To keep furthering my projects, and so you know I appreciate I
[41:41.040 --> 41:43.040]  Appreciate the feedback quite a lot
[41:43.920 --> 41:45.920]  So do you see that question?
[41:46.280 --> 41:52.600]  Outside yeah, Matt horn does fine outside the TK mom didn't have any issues here in Washington outside
[41:54.080 --> 41:56.800]  I wouldn't let it go terribly long like the coffee
[41:57.560 --> 42:00.880]  But I would predict that these Matterhorns will have
[42:02.400 --> 42:06.720]  Some of that built-in resilience, so they'll be able to take it a little bit further
[42:08.280 --> 42:10.280]  But yeah, it does great outside
[42:12.520 --> 42:17.770]  And there it is again
[42:20.170 --> 42:22.170]  She's pretty I
[42:23.250 --> 42:29.090]  Have not had a chance to wash this screen, so I can't really speak to how it hashes
[42:30.490 --> 42:34.810]  But this this next we're getting a whole bunch new we popped a bunch of seeds ourselves
[42:34.810 --> 42:36.690]  So we're running some more stuff in our indoor rooms
[42:36.690 --> 42:40.130]  And we'll try to get some of these washed and give you guys some reports back
[42:40.530 --> 42:42.810]  And if anybody else is out there washing our gear
[42:43.290 --> 42:47.650]  You know let us know it's always fun to hear back on on on what's coming back, and what's not
[42:53.770 --> 42:56.410]  You know and I find a lot of folks that are growing our seeds
[42:56.970 --> 42:59.130]  You know everybody kind of has their little market
[42:59.130 --> 43:05.850]  And they're they're following in I find a lot of people that are growing roots gear are trying to run stuff organically and
[43:07.410 --> 43:13.470]  That's that's really kind of cool. I appreciate that you know not not that you're not running it organic is bad
[43:13.470 --> 43:16.570]  I you know all forms of cultivation are cool with me
[43:17.050 --> 43:23.050]  But you know to see people that are that are not just following the genetics and stuff, but also following the methodology
[43:23.050 --> 43:30.770]  And you know some of the stuff that we're talking about with Korean natural farming or regenerative farming or making hugel beds
[43:32.130 --> 43:33.610]  You know
[43:33.610 --> 43:40.010]  composting avocado tech all these kind of you know components that that you might use as an alternative to
[43:40.530 --> 43:47.290]  Going down to the hydro store and buying some bottles. You know it's really cool to see folks getting the seeds and then also
[43:47.690 --> 43:54.570]  You know picking up some of the methodologies as well, and you know I think that that that lends to a better expression in the plant
[43:54.570 --> 43:56.570]  and a more
[43:56.570 --> 43:57.850]  a
[43:57.850 --> 44:02.490]  More representative expression of the plant you know you you want the turf to be natural you know what I mean
[44:02.490 --> 44:06.970]  You don't you don't want you want to run something like man. Yeah, that tastes like the other stuff
[44:06.970 --> 44:09.850]  I grew because I fed it all the same stuff. You know let the plant
[44:10.730 --> 44:13.050]  Let the plant get in there and get some natural ingredients
[44:13.290 --> 44:18.930]  Ingredients to build its structure and to build its its terpenes and whatnot and I
[44:19.810 --> 44:21.810]  Just think you get a you get a truer
[44:22.490 --> 44:26.370]  Handle on what what that potential of that plant really is
[44:28.170 --> 44:31.010]  So I'm a fan of that yeah, I'm at a horn
[44:31.530 --> 44:36.050]  That one's a good one, and I gave out a bunch of these on the big island
[44:36.610 --> 44:40.610]  Last year folks just smashed them out there shout out
[44:41.170 --> 44:48.090]  Plant strong 808 my homie he grows up at high altitudes, and he just crushes it out there, so
[44:49.410 --> 44:54.530]  What would you how would you describe the difference in flavor between the TK and the coffee?
[44:56.650 --> 44:58.650]  TK is gonna have more gas
[44:58.850 --> 45:00.850]  You know coffee
[45:01.370 --> 45:04.090]  Coffee leans a little more spice earth
[45:04.890 --> 45:10.570]  Kind of tones to it and the TK is just just gassy you know and people like that I like that
[45:11.930 --> 45:17.650]  Sometimes I I want something a little more subtle. You know that that gas stuff. Just it crushes me
[45:18.170 --> 45:22.090]  Which I like I like to I like to go to sleep at night, so that's a good one, but you know daytimes
[45:23.410 --> 45:28.370]  It might be a bit much for people so but both very narcotic in effect very strong
[45:32.680 --> 45:35.040]  That's awesome 8,000 feet elevation
[45:36.040 --> 45:39.080]  That's my friends in Hawaii are like 4,000
[45:42.160 --> 45:47.020]  Yeah, Natalie, I don't know if you answered the question before but where are you
[45:48.960 --> 45:51.600]  Yeah, those high mountain Afghanis are so tasty
[45:52.360 --> 45:57.040]  I'll be Colorado so tasty. It's good. Yeah gotta be Colorado. Yeah, I think
[46:03.410 --> 46:07.490]  All right, so getting back into order while we wait for a little
[46:08.450 --> 46:12.170]  Ah Lake Tahoe, oh cool, that's right
[46:15.850 --> 46:23.860]  Keep that up
[46:26.140 --> 46:31.700]  Get that packaging that now do you hand do you hand stamp each wax?
[46:34.460 --> 46:36.140]  I
[46:36.140 --> 46:38.500]  Do that myself yeah my kids are always like
[46:39.980 --> 46:41.140]  Okay
[46:41.140 --> 46:43.620]  So some of these my kids get to do this part
[46:44.620 --> 46:49.500]  That the stamp right here the black stamp is very you can smudge it and smear it easy
[46:49.500 --> 46:53.500]  So I do those you know it's just a little and then put it on there, but yeah
[46:54.300 --> 46:56.300]  these are all handcrafted and
[46:56.300 --> 47:02.650]  I got some right here
[47:20.320 --> 47:26.840]  We say ten packs or ten seeds per pack, but you know we always throw in an extra seed or two
[47:27.560 --> 47:29.920]  If it makes it in the vial it doesn't come out
[47:30.520 --> 47:32.560]  some people get 15 in the pack just cuz
[47:33.080 --> 47:40.360]  So you want you want to quickly touch on the kaya's pick and then we'll get back to the
[47:42.920 --> 47:48.840]  Yeah, so I've actually got a couple different different things is probably something that's maybe untested
[47:50.320 --> 47:57.040]  I've got some some Washington skunk stuff that I've crossed to some Colorado hemp and made some big
[47:57.600 --> 47:59.600]  dinosaur giant dinosaur beans
[48:00.480 --> 48:06.720]  I've got some crosses that we haven't released that are bred with bubblegum some that are bred with a clementine cush
[48:08.840 --> 48:11.120]  So all kinds of funky stuff that I have
[48:11.900 --> 48:16.560]  You know some sometimes if I if I drop a seed and it lands on the table
[48:16.560 --> 48:18.560]  And I don't know you know I catch it till later
[48:19.040 --> 48:20.400]  I don't just throw those out
[48:20.400 --> 48:24.640]  I scoop them in a little jar and set them to the side I can't put them in a pack if I don't know
[48:24.640 --> 48:28.000]  What it is you know I don't want to do that just too much integrity to do that
[48:28.720 --> 48:31.900]  But I figure you know I keep them and now I've got a good stash of stuff
[48:31.900 --> 48:33.900]  You know that maybe it fell this way or that way
[48:34.400 --> 48:39.520]  And so I throw it in a little a little jar and keep them and sometimes I plant them out in the yard
[48:39.520 --> 48:43.660]  You know I throw out a lot of seed in my backyard. I just get crazy with it
[48:44.680 --> 48:49.160]  But you know I keep some of those too, and so that's something that I could throw in one of these packs
[48:49.840 --> 48:54.720]  And you know you might just have five different seeds or five different
[48:55.720 --> 49:02.320]  Strains in one of these packs that I send so it's a kaya selection. He is selecting
[49:03.560 --> 49:06.680]  He's here reading my choice dealers choice
[49:14.950 --> 49:20.470]  You know I love hash I make hash, but I I'm not I'm not one of these that's all I smoke
[49:21.150 --> 49:23.890]  Kind of people is hash. I enjoy flowers
[49:24.370 --> 49:29.210]  I use flowers a lot if I've got like a you know my stomach hurts or something I
[49:30.330 --> 49:35.050]  Find this this you know more comfort when I'm burning some herbs that way
[49:36.170 --> 49:39.290]  You know sometimes this hash is just too much in the morning. You know they'll
[49:39.970 --> 49:41.410]  Turn me into
[49:41.410 --> 49:46.210]  Have a different kind of day if I got to be productive. I don't want to take a dab first thing in the morning
[49:46.890 --> 49:48.890]  So here's a question
[49:49.530 --> 49:51.130]  Yeah
[49:51.130 --> 49:53.310]  So when we're when we're breeding indoors
[49:54.570 --> 49:57.490]  It's it's real simple. We we only run one
[49:58.370 --> 50:04.770]  Male at a time we've got a couple different places where we do indoor breeding, so that's really easy to keep it
[50:05.770 --> 50:06.810]  segregated
[50:06.810 --> 50:09.410]  And then here on the farm when I'm breeding outside
[50:10.010 --> 50:16.250]  I've got a greenhouse that is is you know self-contained. You know it's not doesn't have any kind of super high-tech filtration, but
[50:17.010 --> 50:19.370]  You know once the males in there and dust this stuff off
[50:19.690 --> 50:25.810]  You know we cut them down and get them out and then outside again. It's you know half an acre away, and
[50:26.810 --> 50:31.690]  you know we just we're kind of picking out the males and then you know picking them up and
[50:31.970 --> 50:37.250]  And dusting them on the females and then getting rid of them, so they're not kind of lingering and spreading pollen around
[50:38.250 --> 50:40.810]  Outside I would say there's a small chance of cross-contamination
[50:41.290 --> 50:46.370]  But for the most part if you've got you know clusters of your females with your male
[50:46.690 --> 50:49.490]  That's that's gonna be what's what's pollinating them
[50:49.490 --> 50:49.970]  you know I mean
[50:49.970 --> 50:54.850]  I don't think any of the pollen from half an acre away is gonna have the chance to get into my greenhouse and
[50:55.770 --> 51:02.610]  And mix up that way so but but you know for the most part a lot of our a lot of our sponsors
[51:02.610 --> 51:05.010]  They're separated by physical distance
[51:05.850 --> 51:07.850]  Indoors I've done it indoors
[51:07.890 --> 51:13.290]  Where I was breeding in tents at one time, and we just put the the can fans inside the little tents
[51:13.930 --> 51:20.610]  And made sure that we had the negative pressure, so it was always sucking so you know if if any air was coming out of
[51:20.610 --> 51:23.610]  That tent it was going through that filter first and not just allowing
[51:24.210 --> 51:26.210]  the pollen to sneak out of the tents
[51:26.610 --> 51:31.130]  and we did that with our with our feminized breeding a couple years back because we were in a
[51:31.650 --> 51:35.050]  In an urban situation where we had a tent set up indoors
[51:36.890 --> 51:39.130]  So I was gonna say speak to the
[51:40.970 --> 51:42.970]  I was just gonna say like
[51:43.610 --> 51:45.610]  separating males and stuff like
[51:45.810 --> 51:50.210]  I've been doing a lot of that. You know the last couple years and
[51:51.210 --> 51:58.690]  You really a half acre. You know or just a barrier. You know is is is all you need you know depending on the situation
[51:58.690 --> 52:04.170]  I mean if you're dry, and it's super windy you might consider that you know, but like we where we live there's
[52:05.210 --> 52:09.330]  Do on the plan every day till 10 o'clock so?
[52:10.290 --> 52:14.690]  You can do you can do a lot like I can even pick up pick up males and move them around when they're all wet
[52:14.690 --> 52:17.230]  Like that you know or maybe I spray them down a little bit
[52:17.230 --> 52:19.370]  you know just kind of using common-sense stuff and and
[52:19.810 --> 52:24.690]  I can I know that that works because I have no seeds on plants
[52:24.690 --> 52:27.970]  You know that are just on the other end of a wall or behind another
[52:28.690 --> 52:30.690]  Stash of trees or whatever I'm doing you know
[52:31.330 --> 52:34.810]  Putting them all over the place, so I just wanted to like say that
[52:37.410 --> 52:41.690]  Yeah, and don't you know don't I've never like walked into a place where there was males
[52:41.690 --> 52:47.770]  And then went into another place where there was a different male don't don't be the vector of moving that pollen yourself
[52:47.770 --> 52:51.690]  That's really smart. I see the question here Peter from rain central I
[52:52.850 --> 52:58.170]  Would definitely say the coffee cube would be you know the most?
[52:58.850 --> 53:00.570]  resilient
[53:00.570 --> 53:05.610]  It's it's just a strong plant it can take weather like like nothing else
[53:05.610 --> 53:10.170]  I've seen and different kinds of weather it can take weather tropical weather it can take cold weather
[53:11.290 --> 53:17.870]  So I would definitely say your coffee is gonna be your best chance, and I know you guys get early inclement weather over there
[53:17.870 --> 53:21.050]  I know it gets cold you're right on the backside of those mountains, so
[53:21.890 --> 53:26.810]  That would be that would definitely be my recommendation. Maybe maybe try that duck a bush just because it's gonna be quicker
[53:29.610 --> 53:33.330]  Anything that's got that that ham a ham in it, that's you know from the nine-pound hammer
[53:33.330 --> 53:37.490]  That was a faster finisher so those those would probably serve you well
[53:42.750 --> 53:49.550]  Natalie that's like our we're not high elevation, but in terms of moisture and heat that's like our climate you know
[53:50.150 --> 53:53.670]  They put on like serious weather alerts if it's gonna be 82
[53:53.670 --> 53:57.030]  You know people are like hunkering down and not going to school shit
[54:02.070 --> 54:04.070]  Yeah
[54:04.070 --> 54:09.070]  You gotta be you got to be a strong plant to survive out here in the weather I mean I
[54:09.830 --> 54:16.350]  Didn't even start growing outside till a couple years ago. I was full-on indoor. You know most of I put it this way
[54:17.310 --> 54:18.990]  pre-legalization
[54:18.990 --> 54:21.350]  Nobody's going outside not in Western, Washington
[54:21.350 --> 54:26.230]  I mean you might have a couple plants on your back deck, but nobody's growing in greenhouses. Nobody was doing it just
[54:27.990 --> 54:29.990]  It just wasn't where it was at you know
[54:30.590 --> 54:32.590]  People were going indoors up here
[54:33.430 --> 54:34.750]  so
[54:34.750 --> 54:38.910]  For me anyways getting outside and and getting the right cultivars
[54:38.910 --> 54:42.230]  it's it's taken a couple years of work and some sifting and
[54:44.110 --> 54:46.110]  You know not everything works outside
[54:49.840 --> 54:51.840]  Okay, so we
[54:53.440 --> 54:55.440]  We jumped a matter
[54:55.440 --> 54:57.000]  Train
[54:57.000 --> 55:01.160]  You want to do freight train at well we had obvious coffee and then freight train
[55:01.160 --> 55:06.840]  We can go freight train first all right. I just gotta keep track of our order, but all right freight train
[55:09.440 --> 55:13.040]  So and again, I wish I was able to pull up a picture for you Peter
[55:13.040 --> 55:17.320]  I'm sorry even some pictures of the moms. I have them. I just got a dig through and grab them
[55:19.160 --> 55:21.160]  This is actually a remake of
[55:21.280 --> 55:23.280]  A
[55:23.320 --> 55:25.320]  Cross we have already done called
[55:25.720 --> 55:32.380]  Espresso espresso where we we cost an earlier version of coffee to this og ghost train Hayes
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.680]  And this one features the og ghost train Hayes with the coffee BX 3 male
[55:38.560 --> 55:45.360]  So the story behind the og ghost train Hayes is in hash competitions in Washington State. It's undefeated
[55:46.880 --> 55:50.380]  Our good friend goat organics at goat organics
[55:51.600 --> 55:53.600]  Shared this cut with us long ago
[55:54.800 --> 55:57.960]  It is an absolutely amazing hasher
[55:58.320 --> 56:02.220]  There's really not many sativa hashers out there
[56:02.800 --> 56:06.680]  As I mean this thing is it's a pure sativa plant it wants 12 weeks
[56:08.320 --> 56:12.240]  It grows big huge it Leo viney big nuggy nugs
[56:13.240 --> 56:17.720]  And the smell on it is lemons and cat piss
[56:18.120 --> 56:24.840]  And there's really nothing quite like it and he gifted us this cut and we've ran it and ran it and
[56:25.600 --> 56:30.640]  Lost it and got it back and somebody always seems to take care of it because it's such a unique
[56:31.200 --> 56:37.440]  terpene profile and high and he won a couple high times cup competitions up here with it and
[56:39.360 --> 56:46.760]  Super fire plant so we again we already released this the expresso a couple years ago, and we've kept this mom around and
[56:47.200 --> 56:48.880]  You know like I said
[56:48.880 --> 56:54.320]  My mission with breeding the coffee forward is getting you know more true breeding males
[56:55.240 --> 56:58.280]  So now I get to go back and remake that cross
[56:59.160 --> 57:01.160]  With a different version of that coffee
[57:03.160 --> 57:07.440]  The plants gonna want to go a little longer than most again coffee goes ten weeks
[57:07.440 --> 57:11.880]  Oh, you're saying Hayes goes 12, so you're looking at 10 to 12 weeks on your flower time
[57:12.240 --> 57:16.080]  But expect some massive hash dumping action on these ones
[57:17.760 --> 57:22.400]  It's the that would you go strain haze is just a cool plant you know super cool plant
[57:22.400 --> 57:27.520]  And I know I think Brian might have even lost that one so I'm gonna try to get him a cut back
[57:27.800 --> 57:29.480]  If you're out there watching
[57:29.480 --> 57:32.880]  appreciate it man he's shared all kinds of hashtag with us and
[57:33.720 --> 57:39.160]  Really really cool. So the guy and that that selection that would you go strain haze I believe came from rare dankness
[57:42.860 --> 57:46.620]  So we got a couple we got questions
[57:47.620 --> 57:49.620]  Recommendations for desert environment
[57:52.580 --> 57:55.900]  There was another someone was in another one
[57:57.180 --> 58:00.780]  Listen, I'm not gonna bullshit. Yeah, I haven't I haven't ran anything in the desert
[58:03.020 --> 58:06.860]  Know anybody I mean I know some folks growing the Sonora Desert
[58:07.260 --> 58:10.300]  Growers is amazing guy out there, but I've never sent him any seed
[58:10.300 --> 58:15.620]  Maybe I should send him some seeds and get him some testing out closer to home closer to home. How about that one?
[58:19.020 --> 58:21.300]  Yes, I can answer that one Garden of Dreams
[58:23.660 --> 58:25.660]  Means that sounds so familiar
[58:26.300 --> 58:28.500]  Do you remember Garden of Dreams guy Dutch blooms?
[58:30.300 --> 58:31.620]  The way
[58:31.620 --> 58:33.620]  He's the alien breeder
[58:33.620 --> 58:38.620]  Anyways, listen, I I really we've grown a lot of our stuff outside this year
[58:38.980 --> 58:43.980]  some of the crosses didn't work a lot of it did work the stuff that anything crossed with the
[58:44.380 --> 58:48.060]  The pinkleberry stuff that we're going forward is we're gonna be working those for
[58:48.740 --> 58:54.020]  For Western Washington like just planting outside and having something done in September
[58:54.660 --> 58:57.300]  Right now we really don't have anything that finishes that quick
[58:57.860 --> 58:59.860]  so
[58:59.900 --> 59:02.580]  Again it's hard with the light to get him to trigger
[59:03.820 --> 59:06.260]  Yeah, I've said it's hard to get him to start
[59:07.460 --> 59:13.100]  There's a sweet spot there, right? Because if they start too soon then when the rain hits they got big buds and they get tore up
[59:14.220 --> 59:17.500]  And we ran some stuff where they started late
[59:18.140 --> 59:21.820]  But then when the rains hit they didn't have the big buds and we were like man
[59:21.820 --> 59:23.460]  These just aren't gonna do anything
[59:23.460 --> 59:27.340]  But once that rain stopped and we got to the last two weeks because here in Western, Washington
[59:27.340 --> 59:30.860]  That's typically what happened there a great summer and then we hit this inclement weather
[59:31.820 --> 59:37.060]  You know late September second week of September. Yep, and everybody goes. Oh shit and
[59:37.820 --> 59:39.620]  It crushes a lot of people's stuff
[59:39.620 --> 59:43.540]  But if you can make it through that if your genetics are good or you know again these buds
[59:43.740 --> 59:46.340]  They didn't look like they were they were underdeveloped at that point
[59:46.340 --> 59:50.700]  So the rain didn't really hurt him and then once that Sun comes back the plant has been triggered
[59:50.700 --> 59:52.180]  It knows times up
[59:52.180 --> 59:55.300]  I got to finish and they really start packing it on at the end
[59:55.620 --> 59:59.620]  And we had a couple cultivars that did that this year and we're like, you know went from going man
[59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.980]  This thing's not gonna do much to holy cow. It just put it on in the last two weeks
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:07.100]  So again, I would recommend like the Duck a bush
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.820]  If you can find the hammer hammer somewhere else
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.020]  But from this menu the Duck a bush is going to be the one
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.540]  Again, it's hard for me to talk guy got so much other stuff that I could recommend
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:23.100]  But for what we're talking about today, the duck a bush is gonna be probably the fastest finisher on that menu
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:29.460]  Outdoor Washington stuff the hammer hammer is one of our favorites. We still run nine pound hammer. It doesn't hash very well
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.980]  But we've bred it to stuff that hashes very well
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:36.740]  So the nine pound hammer itself our keeper cut doesn't hash but the hammer hammer hash is great
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:42.460]  So, you know, we're making good selections along those lines and you know, that's another question. You should ask
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:48.500]  If you're farming out here, like are you farming for flowers or are you are you concentrating on hash?
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:55.660]  You know because that's that's an important question to ask I would say too. So and we do we do have a hash question
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:57.780]  Mm-hmm
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:03.940]  Coffee cut that has a little bit of a waxy trichomes. What is your tech on small batch tests with water and ice?
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:09.860]  I have a decent amount safer fresh frozen. Awesome. So, you know, you can always go out and give them the touch test
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.500]  You know and and if it sticks and create some little
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:21.060]  Spider web things in between your fingers there. That's that's generally a good thing get out there with your scope and scope it
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:25.860]  You know, you don't want the trichomes that are just the little ball sitting on the leaf
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.700]  You want to see the trichomes with a nice long neck on him and a fat head?
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:35.660]  You know BC Bowman is the king of all the terminology with the capitate stock and he knows all the
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:40.220]  Trichome names, but you definitely want to get out there and scope it and look
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:45.620]  Quick test I like to freeze or you know, I get a mason jar
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:52.540]  Throw it in the freezer and just get it cold and then fill it up with ice cubes and water put a lid on it
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:56.500]  Shake it and get that water nice and cold cut down maybe 10 grams of your bud
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:01.980]  Again 10 grams of frozen so it's not 10 grams of dry 10 grams frozen wet
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:06.300]  freeze that real quick and then just drop it in there and give it a shake and
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:10.980]  And then let it sit and on the bottom you'll see or you won't
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:15.180]  We did a test on some CBD stuff because it was just amazing smell
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:21.300]  Absolutely amazing. I know CBD stuff is not but it looked real. Yeah, we looked sculpted and it looked real salty
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.180]  Put it in the jar. You know, it's a little bit of a mess
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:25.540]  Salty
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:29.580]  Put it in the jar gave it the shake smelled crazy water clouded up
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:33.900]  Let it sit and it just never fell out of suspension. There was no hash on the bottom
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.380]  So we knew that's just not gonna work
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.420]  Oil on top from all the turps
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:45.580]  But there was no crystals on the bottom if you get one that will hash there will be crystals visible crystals
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:49.100]  You'll get a little bit of accumulation on the edge here and it doesn't have to be a lot
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:55.260]  But once you see that in there, you know, okay, this one's gonna release its crystals for me and I'll be able to
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:01.980]  Have a good run with that. That's it. That's a nice little test. You can do the quick shake with the ice water
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:09.780]  Stable line of Afghani that's easy. It's a coffee stuff, you know, um
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:17.380]  And again, we'll be releasing more. So basically everything we're talking about today, right? Yeah. Yeah
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:24.220]  Yeah, I've got sativa lines where we're running stuff there's no Afghani at all in it I've got hybridized lines
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:28.540]  The Europe has got some dog walker in it, which is you know, some other stuff
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:34.080]  But yeah for the coffee is is definitely, you know that that niche of stuff
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.860]  That's that's the kind of gear that we're talking about
[01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:45.530]  You smoke the results of the test yeah, so
[01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:49.490]  Generally when I'm processing on scale
[01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:52.170]  I'm gonna pull it out of the bags and
[01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:58.030]  It's either gonna hit the freeze dryer or it's gonna get seeded out and dried on racks in a climate-controlled room
[01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:03.130]  However, when you do this little test, you know, I don't want to I don't want to dump it
[01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:06.730]  I don't I don't not gonna afford to put that little bit in the freeze dryer
[01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:11.030]  So what I do is I it's called old school. It's called basically that's a Gumby tech
[01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:18.030]  The test is a Gumby tech Gumby was a guy who made hash a long time ago and so you do that water shake test
[01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:24.190]  And then once you let it sit and then let it sit and all the stuff falls to the bottom scoop out the material
[01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:25.190]  I
[01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:31.390]  Scoop the material out and then just pour it off until there's a little bit of water left and your hash is still in there
[01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:33.430]  Right the hash will try to chase the water out and then just stop
[01:04:34.030 --> 01:04:38.990]  And then you'll basically have your little bit of hash in less water and then you can pour that out
[01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:41.470]  Onto a screen
[01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:43.390]  or even on to just
[01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:48.110]  You know some parchment paper or even leave it in the jar. I like to pour it out on parchment paper
[01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:50.390]  It's easier to collect and then set it somewhere that's warm
[01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:55.430]  I can put it on top of my hash press you put on top of a light and it will evaporate that water off and
[01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:57.430]  Then you'll have the little sticky
[01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:59.630]  Gumby hash
[01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:04.510]  From your test and you can you know ball that up and put it on your on your herbs and burn it. However you like
[01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:12.790]  What traits do you find most reliably pass from males to the progeny
[01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:17.030]  It depends
[01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:19.150]  Males do different things
[01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:23.590]  Different males will connect and combine in different sequences with different
[01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:28.230]  moms, so there's really not a hard and fast rule I
[01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:33.830]  Know when I was working with my coffee f2 male or sorry the alien Kush f2 male
[01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:36.950]  It would pass on purple color
[01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:41.350]  It would shorten the stature and improve the structure and it would it would add some crystals
[01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:43.750]  But it would never do really anything for smell
[01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:49.990]  it would let the the mom that I was breeding to the smell would pass through it would add a little bit of a
[01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:56.110]  Crystallization maybe some purple to it and that was you know, I knew that he could reliably do that now
[01:05:56.110 --> 01:06:02.630]  We didn't do that with everything some things that it crossed with didn't but it was a pretty reliable male for that trait
[01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:10.030]  When I'm breeding with coffee, I'm seeing it extend, you know big bud size it's passing on its hash making capabilities
[01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:15.270]  Sometimes that happens. Sometimes it doesn't so the you know
[01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:22.390]  Every male is gonna do something different and we can make our best guesses when we're picking males by doing stem rub
[01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:27.310]  or you know checking out structure or leaf shape or any number of
[01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:29.830]  cues that we are receiving
[01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:34.910]  But in actuality until you test that progeny until you put it in the ground and grow it you really don't know
[01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:39.750]  You can't predict how it's going to interact or what it's going. You know what the babies are gonna look like
[01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:46.870]  So that's you know, that's kind of the the cool part of the process and and when you get a male and you can put
[01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:48.870]  it on ten different
[01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:50.190]  females
[01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:53.470]  And you know those females well, and then you can run all those out
[01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:59.070]  And you can really get a grasp on how that male is interacting and what kind of stuff he's putting it on
[01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:01.790]  It's hard to really determine when you only have a small
[01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:09.270]  Pool to look at but as your pools get bigger as Josh can attest then you can really see what's going on there, right?
[01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:11.270]  Josh
[01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:13.270]  Yeah
[01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:21.070]  I was telling you the someone asked earlier if we were gonna do any collabs and it'll probably be
[01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:23.150]  I was gonna give you this cut on the
[01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:25.150]  And I was telling you
[01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:29.230]  When you were here that I selected out of like I don't twelve hundred fourteen hundred
[01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:34.390]  Seeds and I made a number of selections as I was going through it, you know
[01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:37.510]  There's kind of two ways. I'm going with it
[01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:41.310]  One's a fruitier less gas and one is just gas to the fucking max
[01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:46.030]  With with a little bit with the skittles in it and just a little bit
[01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:49.030]  I mean, I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie
[01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:52.590]  With a little bit with the skittles in it and just a little bit and
[01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:56.390]  Anyways, I I was I was stoked
[01:07:56.390 --> 01:08:01.270]  I didn't pull this one till the very end was it was the point of the story is I had all these other ones selected
[01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:05.270]  And tagged and then at the very end as I was chopping it down. I was like, whoa
[01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:07.750]  what the fuck is that don't touch that one, you know like and
[01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:12.470]  and I was able to revenge it and and then uh the kind of the
[01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:15.430]  protest came over
[01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:19.910]  It's I didn't say I told you what was what that's the one you were like
[01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:22.590]  that's the fucking loud one man get after that one, so
[01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:27.350]  Now that's kind of my point and the larger says you get to see that shit, you know
[01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:31.070]  Otherwise, I wouldn't have maybe maybe I definitely you know may have missed it or whatever, you know
[01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:34.470]  No, I I got to walk through
[01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:36.990]  Josh's garden just before harvest and
[01:08:39.150 --> 01:08:42.830]  He did he kind of followed behind me didn't really like lead me and say this is that you know
[01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:48.030]  These are over here and that and you know, I let my nose lead myself and we did
[01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:52.070]  Yeah, he picked out some killer winners in there and was revenge in them and you know
[01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:56.650]  We were in there praying over like come on, babe. We need this one to come back that that f2 is
[01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:59.190]  unbelievable, bro
[01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:00.950]  unbelievable
[01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:01.910]  Whoo?
[01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:06.230]  Dang stink. Yeah stinking Cassie and had huge nugs on it
[01:09:06.230 --> 01:09:10.670]  I can't wait to get my hands on that one when you sent me the picture of it rooted. I was like, yes
[01:09:11.190 --> 01:09:13.190]  Yeah, and that was the first one I was just like
[01:09:15.230 --> 01:09:20.070]  Yeah, you know I mean, you know when you find one that's like holy shit, you know it you know
[01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:24.590]  And that's it. That's exciting. I mean, that's what's really like what what word what we're doing this for
[01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:30.190]  That's what drives herbs is is the dank. It's not the mids. Nobody gets excited over mids. Nobody gives a shit, you know
[01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:35.350]  It's always like yes, so we got me in the weed was like, oh my god. This is crazy
[01:09:35.350 --> 01:09:39.930]  What is that? You know, and that's what we all want. We don't want like yeah, you know or
[01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:43.910]  Cardboard turps or none of that. So we want that like holy shit
[01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:48.790]  because we know it's gonna have a really awesome effect on our bodies and our minds and
[01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:53.790]  You gotta let that nose lead you and that's it. You made a good selection on that one
[01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:55.950]  I'm so glad you saved it, you know
[01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:57.950]  And a lot of times you don't know until you cut them
[01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:03.270]  You can be smelling them or watching them the whole way through and they really you really don't know until the end
[01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:06.430]  What the final expression is gonna be and you got to be patient
[01:10:07.150 --> 01:10:09.150]  You know and even at that point
[01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:13.190]  You don't know what the translations gonna be right burn it
[01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:15.230]  You don't know it's gonna taste like that a lot of times
[01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:20.030]  It'll smell like that look good and then you burn it and I was like, you know, so
[01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:27.350]  You know following up and getting that burn test that effects test or that wash test or whatever it is that you're you know
[01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:28.590]  shooting for
[01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:30.590]  vitally important
[01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:36.510]  You know before you go killing things or making a final selection. I've made that mistake in the past and then you know
[01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:43.030]  Courage people to you know, finish up the process on your selections. You may say oh, I really like this plant
[01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:47.270]  This one grew the best this one, but at the end it might not be the one that speaks to you
[01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:51.470]  So give them all their just do you know, I'd like to run plants a couple times
[01:10:52.230 --> 01:10:54.350]  Before I'm passive a real judgment on them
[01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:58.150]  Give them some different environments even or you know, I
[01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:03.050]  Never screw up a running then go on I was just bad genetics, you know
[01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:06.690]  It's probably my fault that it didn't turn out right if it didn't turn out right, you know
[01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:09.650]  Do you run?
[01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:11.790]  Do you run one male or multiple males?
[01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:19.150]  Kind of for that same reason to not fuck things up. I've kind of chosen at least two males on on everything
[01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:25.610]  I'm dumping on but just curious. Yeah, you know, I think one male is gonna give you a real narrow
[01:11:25.730 --> 01:11:31.930]  Deal and and and you're gonna know exactly what that guy does and if you're narrowing your selections, that's important
[01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:34.690]  But there's also times when you're trying to open up your selections
[01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:39.730]  And open up the gene pool and that's when you may want to use more than one girl more than one boy
[01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:46.210]  It really kind of depends on where you're at in that selection process if you're opening up the pool or you're closing it down
[01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:51.650]  So it really kind of varies, you know
[01:11:51.650 --> 01:11:53.650]  So did we
[01:11:54.450 --> 01:12:01.210]  Did we talk freight train? Isn't that what we just did? Okay, just so we're on the home stretch because we got a
[01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:09.570]  The James Loud show kicks off at 11 and I got to eat some food before then so we are on to the obvious coffee
[01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:13.810]  Yeah, so obvious coffee bread with the Abhi deco
[01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:18.010]  This was a plant that was gifted to us by some some good friends
[01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:22.770]  Abhi deco comes out of Israel. It's been used over there for the medical program
[01:12:23.690 --> 01:12:30.130]  Using all kinds of cool stuff for treating children and high CBD strains. So this one's I believe is like a 22
[01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:32.770]  To one something along those lines
[01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:36.730]  CBD to THC so when we cross these two
[01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:42.290]  THC strains like coffee what we're trying to achieve is more of a one-to-one ratio
[01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:47.530]  We think that that makes the best medicine as opposed, you know, don't get me wrong 22 to ones are good for a certain purpose
[01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:51.250]  They're really good for juicing for treating kids that have seizure disorders and stuff
[01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:58.090]  But I personally like that that more one-to-one ratio and if I could find something like that that washes
[01:12:58.370 --> 01:13:04.290]  Then I'll have made a real breakthrough and this obvious coffee has an incredible onion smell to it
[01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:06.770]  So I think that's a really good thing. I think that's a really good thing
[01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:14.250]  I'll have made a real breakthrough and this obvious coffee has an incredible onion smell to it. I find the CBD
[01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:16.650]  strains
[01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:21.010]  Really are kind of the most turpy stuff out there. You find really crazy cherries and
[01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:26.890]  Just you know smell that call computer smells where it's like that's not even a natural smell. I don't know what that is
[01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:31.810]  I can't even describe it and I found that in a lot of CBD stuff. This one is
[01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:35.410]  an extremely pronounced onion smell
[01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:41.850]  Hippie girl armpit kind of funk to it, which is is great
[01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:46.090]  So yeah, that's the that's the obvious coffee
[01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:47.370]  And if you you know
[01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:52.370]  You can pick up a pack obvious coffee and then I'd throw in a different one if you wanted but the obvious coffee is gonna
[01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:53.970]  Be the freebie
[01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:57.650]  For this offer today. So if you buy a coffee cubed
[01:13:58.330 --> 01:14:03.270]  You'll get the obvious coffee as your freebie if you buy a Matterhorn you're gonna get the obvious coffee as your freebie
[01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:06.390]  I'd like to get these out there in the world. I like to see people
[01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:11.870]  You know pop in these seeds and and getting that medicine into their life
[01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:17.330]  So we try to do one CBD we call it a CBD enhanced cross
[01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:21.230]  So we try to do one of those with with most every breeding that we do
[01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:29.150]  You know just as a reminder that you know, we're doing this for for the right purposes and putting out stuff. That's
[01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:31.750]  Got medicinal properties to it
[01:14:37.290 --> 01:14:39.290]  Alright
[01:14:40.050 --> 01:14:43.690]  Any last questions and then we'll so
[01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:46.530]  basically
[01:14:46.530 --> 01:14:52.450]  Kai is kind of light, you know, like you think of bands like the Rolling Stones. They have a deep library a
[01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:54.970]  catalog so like if they're playing
[01:14:55.890 --> 01:15:00.730]  Madison Square Garden for four straight nights, they don't have to play the same hits over and over
[01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:07.290]  so today is just like some of his lineup and we'll come back again in a couple days with like
[01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:10.770]  The next the next show
[01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:17.170]  So we thought today short and sweet, yep
[01:15:17.970 --> 01:15:22.850]  Thank you so much for this platform and and putting out, you know, you work tirelessly
[01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:26.730]  I see how many videos you put out and you're constantly working
[01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:31.530]  And getting stuff out to the people and in a wide range from you know
[01:15:31.530 --> 01:15:36.650]  the big guys to little guys and everything in between and I just think you know, really awesome for you to get that in
[01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:42.610]  Information out why this particular broadcast goes with making seeds available
[01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:50.050]  Yeah, and making seeds available to people and giving them access to the breeder where we can come and talk is really really clutch so
[01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:56.530]  What's to me that's the important thing is kind of introducing people to people that they should
[01:15:57.290 --> 01:16:03.570]  Know about and then you know hearing not just like a soundbite of someone's story
[01:16:03.570 --> 01:16:05.570]  But kind of you know, we have
[01:16:06.090 --> 01:16:07.770]  Unfortunately today we have a time limit
[01:16:07.770 --> 01:16:12.850]  But normally it's like if you want to talk about what makes you you for an hour like let's do it
[01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:15.690]  a
[01:16:16.210 --> 01:16:18.210]  Super important question
[01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:25.750]  You see that one
[01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:33.090]  I'm not seeing it. It says what do you use for your treatment? That's a mean beard son
[01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:42.070]  Nice
[01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:46.590]  Interesting. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I actually use a
[01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:49.670]  Give me just one second. I'm gonna go grab it
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.760]  There's I know what he's gonna grab there's a I'm pretty sure I
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:00.160]  don't want to spoil it if I'm wrong, but
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:10.520]  Whoa, all right this stuff right here high seas beard. Yeah our friend Leslie from Stella Marie all-natural stuff
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:18.360]  Super good stuff we take care of it, you know and in the labs help I do I ingest
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:24.320]  Korean natural farming inputs if you're if you're ingesting labs lactic acid bacterium
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:31.520]  It's a probiotic and it's gonna help you to grow great nails and and beautiful hair and beards
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.760]  Thanks for asking
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:41.840]  All right, let me see if there's any
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:48.840]  Yeah, you got the kids too we all got kids so don't worry about it you can do you wants to know how we spell Seahawks
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.280]  Good how old
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.640]  My babies are six seven and eleven
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:06.030]  Okay, so I'm trying to
[01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:10.590]  You thought I only bred plants
[01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:13.110]  You thought I only bred plants
[01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:18.070]  And do you have dominant male genes
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.120]  Because both my daughters look exactly like
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:32.280]  I'm breeding into some Hawaiian landers. And yeah, we make a good match. We pair up. Well
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.440]  All right, well, why don't we let's wrap it on that
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:43.800]  You can pick packs up at that website scrolling across the bottom of the screen
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:50.400]  We can even add some of the ones we didn't talk about today and then talk about them in the next couple days
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:59.400]  In the next at 11, so for those of you not on the West Coast, it's currently 1043 in the a.m.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.400]  But at 11
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:06.200]  Boom James loud
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.360]  James loud getting old school. Do you know any of these guys?
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:17.000]  Yeah, yeah dungeon vault genetics that's uh, he's my neighbor out here and
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:23.560]  Mosca seeds big respect Moscow seeds. He'd been around for a long time black flies used to do big work with those guys
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.880]  black market days in the
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.880]  90s
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.560]  Those were good days
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.840]  All right, well let's
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.680]  Let I'm just seeing if there's any
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.560]  Thank You Justin
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.200]  Thank You Brandon
[01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:55.070]  Ki is good shit. Let's end on that one
[01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:04.470]  Thank you back in 15 minutes
[01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:07.910]  So just hit the refresh button in about 15 minutes
