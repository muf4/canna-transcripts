[00:00.510 --> 00:07.710]  All right, and we are live from Los Angeles and the great state of Utah. Why
[00:07.710 --> 00:10.750]  don't you kick us off?
[00:10.750 --> 00:18.750]  Omayy Padmey Admey Omayy Omayy Padmey Admey Omayy
[00:18.750 --> 00:23.670]  I think this is a great entry because we can talk about the we're all mean and
[00:23.670 --> 00:28.590]  the good for everyone here when this discussion comes forth and we're all
[00:28.590 --> 00:33.750]  pretty much on the same harmonic with a little bit of distortion in between so
[00:33.750 --> 00:40.350]  many you and I were talking about this earlier how like so many of us in the
[00:40.350 --> 00:45.030]  canvas industry are moving along the same path we're on this really close
[00:45.030 --> 00:52.410]  frequency but sometimes if you're not quite in harmonic those frequencies get
[00:52.410 --> 00:56.330]  out of whack and you get this
[00:56.330 --> 01:02.730]  not static and not noise but almost like a...
[01:02.730 --> 01:04.730]  It's like discord.
[01:04.730 --> 01:06.730]  Discord, that's exactly it.
[01:06.730 --> 01:11.170]  And so we don't want to have that discord we want to move forward and
[01:11.170 --> 01:20.370]  never forward ever onward and maintain a reasonable discourse, discussion and
[01:20.410 --> 01:25.170]  maintaining the harmonica. We're all looking for sustainability we're all
[01:25.170 --> 01:33.970]  looking for how is this easily done for the best returns. You know so much of my
[01:33.970 --> 01:41.610]  essence is not taking any more than we need to survive. There's a lot of us and
[01:41.610 --> 01:45.050]  there's a lot more of us coming and we got kids that need to survive as well.
[01:45.050 --> 01:51.090]  And so how do we do this maximize the returns from the least amount of energy
[01:51.090 --> 02:00.050]  inputs. And so I guess our main discussion we're hitting on is in soil
[02:00.050 --> 02:07.930]  science and soil horizon concepts and we're looking at mineralization versus
[02:07.970 --> 02:16.570]  weathering and how those two contribute to our plant growth and whether we're
[02:16.570 --> 02:24.450]  growing tomatoes, trees or cannabis plants. I have 18 fruit and nut trees on my
[02:24.450 --> 02:30.050]  property and I did 16 years as an arborist. My background you know I did
[02:30.050 --> 02:34.170]  this two and a half hour ramble telling a whole big story but in short closer to
[02:34.170 --> 02:40.570]  soil. I've 10 years of wildland firefighting. I literally have dug through
[02:40.570 --> 02:45.330]  the organic matter hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles all over the
[02:45.330 --> 02:50.090]  western states where there's very little where there's a lot in trees and shrubs
[02:50.090 --> 02:57.270]  and down by the creeks by hand and literally removing the organic matter so
[02:57.270 --> 03:00.410]  that you can stop a fire from progressing and seeing what's growing
[03:00.410 --> 03:03.730]  there what's happening what's going on with the roots what's growing and what's
[03:03.770 --> 03:09.010]  not what things smell like. Then I literally used to sleep in the dirt 200
[03:09.010 --> 03:15.010]  nights a year for pleasure and work. I got a pretty close bond to the earth and
[03:15.010 --> 03:20.170]  the soil. I have a really good understanding how things work the basis
[03:20.170 --> 03:28.050]  of trees and fire landscape renewals and how ecosystems years work and move
[03:28.050 --> 03:34.930]  forward and which plants are growing where when why how soil builds all this
[03:34.930 --> 03:42.290]  stuff is part of understanding forestry and it really is. Growing trees and
[03:42.290 --> 03:46.530]  carrots are really similar but trees are a hundred years and the root mass is as
[03:46.530 --> 03:52.090]  big as the top and so you've got a whole different scenario going on from a
[03:52.090 --> 04:04.010]  carrot or an annual woody herb. Let's see. Pete, how's that for a start off to
[04:04.010 --> 04:09.770]  where we're going today? No it's good. So what we talked about before we came on
[04:09.770 --> 04:17.650]  was kind of the idea of you know I like the idea of creating a platform where
[04:17.650 --> 04:23.330]  people can share their ideas but ideas are meant to be challenged and improved
[04:23.330 --> 04:31.410]  on and so ideas are put out there and you know the hope is that people who
[04:31.410 --> 04:34.970]  know what they're talking about react and I think with this channel I mean
[04:34.970 --> 04:39.490]  people who have been watching and participating for the I mean it's
[04:39.490 --> 04:47.810]  specifically for the past year. Cheddar Bob, heckling me. You know there are a lot of
[04:47.810 --> 04:53.570]  people with you know PhD behind their name or people who are very smart who
[04:53.570 --> 04:57.650]  who will put ideas out there and then you'll see someone else come on and say
[04:57.650 --> 05:05.930]  something totally different and I hope you've all noticed that by now and you
[05:05.930 --> 05:12.370]  know the goal is to almost have Lincoln-Douglas style debate
[05:12.370 --> 05:18.450]  conversations where you're not calling each other a douche because you disagree
[05:18.450 --> 05:23.450]  on one topic you're actually you know articulating with your logic and from
[05:23.450 --> 05:27.730]  your vantage point and with your experience why you feel how you feel or
[05:27.730 --> 05:35.210]  why you're stating your point and you let someone respond and you know have a
[05:35.210 --> 05:42.770]  good discourse on it versus starting to scream at each other and I view this as
[05:42.770 --> 05:47.650]  one of those examples with Soil Horizons specifically but obviously there are
[05:47.650 --> 05:54.930]  many other topics that we could jump on you know and the other thing I had said
[05:54.930 --> 06:00.930]  I think in one of the last shows was you know when you hear an idea from someone
[06:00.930 --> 06:06.690]  who you think is very smart test it don't just apply it across your entire
[06:06.690 --> 06:15.930]  operation whether your operation is six plants or or six acres you know test and
[06:15.930 --> 06:24.170]  verify and so Alex had posted some Instagram posts based on one of the
[06:24.170 --> 06:28.330]  recent videos on Soil Horizons and I thought it was important to bring him on
[06:28.330 --> 06:35.890]  as someone who knows his shit and has studied this at the at the university
[06:35.890 --> 06:42.650]  level and hands-on life experience level to give his perspective so that's kind
[06:42.650 --> 06:50.850]  of my starting point and and my hope is that you do most of the talking but you
[06:50.850 --> 06:58.090]  know what today's topic is. Right and I'm gonna try and look at the screen here I
[06:58.090 --> 07:03.530]  got a little lag on my computer I don't have a camera on it so I have to go
[07:03.530 --> 07:06.650]  through the phone in the computer but I want to I'm gonna try and watch people's
[07:06.650 --> 07:13.290]  questions and stuff here and I've got since I saw that video I've been really
[07:13.290 --> 07:16.010]  trying to I realize like man I have all this knowledge and I haven't been
[07:16.010 --> 07:23.850]  really teaching it on my Instagram but I'm not teaching in PFA anymore but I
[07:23.850 --> 07:28.370]  probably should be teaching it because there's a lot of like I got this
[07:28.370 --> 07:33.690]  information and why why should I bother I'm not gonna profit directly but my
[07:33.690 --> 07:38.190]  daughter is if you all understand that if we do it wrong we're putting in too
[07:38.190 --> 07:42.410]  much energy we're just wasting time money and energy that could be put
[07:42.410 --> 07:46.970]  towards a bettering of something else so I've been trying to put together kind of
[07:46.970 --> 07:53.090]  a set of thoughts that my Instagram that kind of explains this stuff in a deep
[07:53.130 --> 07:58.650]  scientific and mathematical progression without over doing it and I realized
[07:58.650 --> 08:02.050]  again one of my first premises is we've all got a different perspective we've
[08:02.050 --> 08:05.650]  all got a different set of experiences and so I know when people read through
[08:05.650 --> 08:10.490]  that stuff it's just Greek and I'm not necessarily the best person at
[08:10.490 --> 08:16.290]  translating it then but there's some amazing some of the videos that have
[08:16.290 --> 08:22.730]  been presented in here talking about soil science do talk about a lot of
[08:22.730 --> 08:27.770]  stuff and I'm terrible things I'm not gonna be saying look at this guy what he
[08:27.770 --> 08:33.930]  said I have a lot of stuff to I'm not gonna reference a study I'm not gonna
[08:33.930 --> 08:38.770]  reference a book I'm gonna say it because I know it's it's something I can
[08:38.770 --> 08:46.930]  spend hours looking for a book to find what pages on someplace but so I've also
[08:46.930 --> 08:57.010]  run a dirt farm and clay and 300 organic vegetable varieties corn ancient grains
[08:57.010 --> 09:05.570]  and architects things like that my home farm micro farm is pure sand there's
[09:05.690 --> 09:09.450]  granite is my most favorite thing I spent two summers living in Tuolumne
[09:09.450 --> 09:13.730]  meadows and the bed of granite the magical thing to lay upon there's
[09:13.730 --> 09:21.090]  definitely stuff that goes on with soil and in rocks and things that we can't
[09:21.090 --> 09:26.850]  verify scientifically and I have all sorts of experiences with UFOs that I've
[09:26.850 --> 09:30.730]  photographed and everything but I can't verify this stuff scientifically so I'm
[09:30.730 --> 09:35.290]  not gonna say hey this stuff is real I say this is my experience and this is
[09:35.290 --> 09:42.530]  what I understand this what happened to me but when it comes to the universal
[09:42.530 --> 09:49.450]  laws we can recognize through observation and instruments extensions
[09:49.450 --> 09:54.570]  of our observation the it gets quantified and we've been looking at
[09:54.570 --> 10:00.050]  soils there's 10,000 years people have been farming and one of the first
[10:00.050 --> 10:06.770]  premises is we remove rocks we don't add them to our planting mixes or our
[10:06.770 --> 10:14.450]  fields and the one the one exception is if you've got drainage issues is really
[10:14.450 --> 10:22.410]  where we would want to put rocks in my my home property here being sand over
[10:22.450 --> 10:30.530]  the 20 years I've been here I did 16 years running tree services and 10 of
[10:30.530 --> 10:37.330]  that being here I would layer wood chips in on top of the sand just keep weeds down
[10:37.330 --> 10:45.290]  don't want a lawn in the middle of desert water is expensive and the sand
[10:45.290 --> 10:49.210]  never broke down in those 20 years but I've applied probably two feet of wood
[10:49.250 --> 10:54.690]  chips and there's a couple of scrabbler inches on top at this point and so there
[10:54.690 --> 10:59.370]  we have two different things going on I've built this beautiful black top soil
[10:59.370 --> 11:08.290]  organic matter layer horizon in what was just a pure sand and the yard was dead
[11:08.290 --> 11:17.490]  when I got here most trees were yeah whatever so the soil the sand the sand
[11:17.530 --> 11:23.690]  hasn't broken down in 20 years at all we get maybe 10 inches of rain in the
[11:23.690 --> 11:27.290]  valley here it used to snow we used to get two feet of snow piled up it doesn't
[11:27.290 --> 11:32.610]  anymore it rains it snows it melts things are definitely warming up here
[11:32.610 --> 11:37.690]  but we still we get these deep freeze situations where there's mechanical
[11:37.690 --> 11:41.930]  freeze-thaw happening to that soil and those particles are such a small size
[11:41.930 --> 11:46.610]  already they're really not getting any action on them and and so when the sand
[11:46.610 --> 11:51.770]  gets to a certain small size or any rock particle it's weathered right it
[11:51.770 --> 11:57.330]  comes from this used to be the granite mountains above me and through glaciation
[11:57.330 --> 12:04.690]  rocks in rivers gravity pulling things down off the mountains and stuff and
[12:04.690 --> 12:08.970]  these rocks get banged up and smashed and pulverized into small particles and
[12:08.970 --> 12:14.010]  over time they get flushed out to sea and smaller the smaller the particles
[12:14.170 --> 12:20.570]  get acted on by acid and alkali and that's our what we have redux happening
[12:20.570 --> 12:26.730]  right and yep and so here here we go all of a sudden you got to understand what
[12:26.730 --> 12:33.930]  pH means parts hydrogen and all of a sudden you got to know what oxidation
[12:33.930 --> 12:40.570]  and reduction is and and why we need oxygen in the soil and why we need okay
[12:40.570 --> 12:45.490]  so let's back up again and and so so we've got these mountains have been
[12:45.490 --> 12:49.650]  ground up by glacier by but and actually some of this part of the stand here came
[12:49.650 --> 12:59.050]  from when the ice cap and glaciation broke and the massive floods rushed down
[12:59.050 --> 13:05.050]  and formed the southwest but we're talking about hundreds of thousands of
[13:05.050 --> 13:11.810]  years of actual forces of nature to smash and stuff and pulverizing things
[13:11.810 --> 13:18.130]  and forming smaller particles and and some some of the minerals that make up
[13:18.130 --> 13:23.250]  these particles are harder and less susceptible to acids and alkalis
[13:23.250 --> 13:28.610]  breaking them down and or temperature etc but here here I am in 20 years in my
[13:28.610 --> 13:34.730]  yard I've got I've got this fan that's been deposited here millennia ago and
[13:34.730 --> 13:40.010]  it's still the same sand except for I've added all this organic matter wood chips
[13:40.010 --> 13:46.770]  over 20 years and and so the wood chips have broken down and and they're a nice
[13:46.770 --> 13:53.650]  black layer has worked itself into the soil 10 inches and beneath that if I
[13:53.650 --> 14:02.770]  haven't turned it over it's just pure fine sand there's no nitrogen in the
[14:02.770 --> 14:09.810]  sand nitrogen moves through sand like same speed as water does and so it's
[14:09.810 --> 14:15.650]  what's breaking that down is basically nitrogen out of the air being absorbed
[14:15.650 --> 14:23.410]  by microbes at the surface in the interface where this pores in the sand
[14:23.410 --> 14:27.610]  and there when you get high pressure storms whatever the air gets pressed in
[14:27.610 --> 14:31.970]  and nitrogen is pressed into the soil I got chickens running around but but
[14:31.970 --> 14:35.690]  their contribution of 20 years is negligible for the nitrogen it takes to
[14:35.690 --> 14:41.890]  break down on wood chips turn it into beautiful humus in the soil black black
[14:41.890 --> 14:50.290]  sand is now all over the yard that's mineralization though and so so the
[14:50.290 --> 14:55.970]  org it that takes place in two three years from from if things are broken
[14:55.970 --> 15:00.570]  down small you know log takes a lot longer than a twig right surface to
[15:00.570 --> 15:11.490]  volume ratio in both the organic matter particles and the mineral particles
[15:11.490 --> 15:18.490]  or or rocks right so so these things need to get broken down in the smaller
[15:18.490 --> 15:24.170]  and smaller particles and the stuff that plants use the Brondo the actual
[15:24.170 --> 15:28.170]  broadest I saw that so many times I didn't have no idea till about two months
[15:28.170 --> 15:33.330]  ago I thought these clips what the plants crave and that's that black fine
[15:33.330 --> 15:37.930]  organic matter that breaks that everything breaks down to eventually the
[15:37.930 --> 15:47.450]  superfine black stuff that used to be plants it's now muck right and it
[15:47.450 --> 15:50.610]  doesn't have anything else in the structure in there it doesn't get a lot
[15:50.610 --> 15:56.090]  of air moving through it but that's the stuff the plants are feeding on after
[15:56.090 --> 16:00.490]  all the bacteria and the fungus that's broken down the worms have eaten it and
[16:00.490 --> 16:08.330]  let everything in there get do their job there's ways we can enhance that in
[16:08.330 --> 16:13.370]  our soil but if your soils already got all that adding more it shows the
[16:13.370 --> 16:19.690]  science doesn't make a difference so so the first thing we want to understand
[16:19.690 --> 16:27.010]  about about soil is that hey hey Alex yeah just one no no no yeah that so this
[16:27.010 --> 16:34.170]  is my brother Michael I'm Michael good to meet you and I gotta go meet Tyler
[16:34.170 --> 16:39.050]  from family tree seeds to pick up a bunch of beans to put on the website so
[16:39.050 --> 16:44.010]  I'll be back in 10 minutes so it'll be the two of you and I'll be back oh and
[16:44.010 --> 16:49.730]  spot check news check your email I sent you an invite to and I'll send some
[16:49.730 --> 16:56.090]  others when I get back but uh all right I'll be back nice carry on cool
[16:56.090 --> 17:01.130]  Michael that Michael the topic is soil science one that you're deeply versed in
[17:01.130 --> 17:06.330]  right I'm flying blind here so take it away it's all good I'll just ramble and
[17:06.330 --> 17:12.810]  you can smile all right let's see your ramble for the next 10 minutes sure um
[17:12.810 --> 17:22.850]  all right so so here let's see if we can show nicely here's organic matter
[17:22.850 --> 17:28.370]  let's see where's my I don't have a I don't have a light in there so I just
[17:28.370 --> 17:34.330]  pulled some compost out and you know it's full of worms and this is getting
[17:34.330 --> 17:40.050]  broke down but at this point you know you can top layer stuff like this I
[17:40.050 --> 17:46.290]  prefer to sit it down and get smaller that should be a good portion of what we
[17:46.290 --> 17:55.170]  feed our plant so what I was like to say was uh in the entire world terrestrial
[17:55.170 --> 18:04.550]  land plant earth earth-bearing plant not not the ocean 80% of nutrient uptake by
[18:04.550 --> 18:15.270]  plants is from mineralized not weathered sources okay and so that's
[18:15.270 --> 18:21.270]  including trees that grow a thousand years and grasses that grow for a season
[18:21.270 --> 18:31.310]  and the majority of plants are things that grow for a season or a hundred
[18:31.310 --> 18:40.470]  years or less so truly the majority of what the brondo for plants is that
[18:40.470 --> 18:49.270]  living decomposing plant matter and so when we start adding in worms into our
[18:49.270 --> 18:58.550]  organic matter it breaks down and becomes really fine and over time you
[18:58.550 --> 19:05.070]  end up having a situation where all of your material in a container for
[19:05.070 --> 19:12.510]  instance has become super fine so so we've come we've
[19:12.950 --> 19:17.590]  let me back up a minute here so we know we know the year all the plants are
[19:17.590 --> 19:25.450]  consuming the what was decomposed plant matter and the scientists that shows dr.
[19:25.530 --> 19:32.530]  Lane will tell you that that our basis annuals really love a soil that's
[19:32.530 --> 19:40.050]  extremely similar to an old growth forests soil ecosystems here how far
[19:40.050 --> 19:46.250]  that soil has progressed in its bacterial microbial state and it's a
[19:46.250 --> 19:53.690]  fungal dominant state in that soil for instance if we're talking about the
[19:53.730 --> 19:56.730]  concepts or you might have heard people saying like they didn't know they were
[19:56.730 --> 20:02.010]  digging into this fungal dominant soil putting their cannabis pits in there but
[20:02.010 --> 20:08.330]  they were doing this amazing inoculation process and one thing that we might not
[20:08.330 --> 20:14.090]  pay attention to is that they were digging into clear-cut properties that
[20:14.090 --> 20:20.330]  they had purchased and was going back and brush but it but we changed the
[20:20.330 --> 20:29.770]  ecological seer we had a clear cut and things were very different you get your
[20:29.770 --> 20:33.730]  redwoods are sprouting back up they've got their tap roots down where they've
[20:33.730 --> 20:36.930]  been for 3,000 years because every time that tree burned it just grows again I
[20:36.930 --> 20:40.890]  think the clone it goes back in the morning even if we drill it we know it's
[20:40.890 --> 20:45.090]  a thousand or three thousand years old those things are ancient I think I think
[20:45.090 --> 20:49.250]  there's a bush out in the Mojave Desert they call the king clone it's a grease
[20:49.330 --> 20:55.610]  wood they're finding out to be 14,000 years from the under dry and every time
[20:55.610 --> 21:01.330]  it burns it just clones out from its roots cannabis doesn't do that tomatoes
[21:01.330 --> 21:06.010]  don't do that anything we're growing in our gardens not going to do that so so
[21:06.010 --> 21:10.690]  we're looking at a slightly different rhizosphere for our plants here at this
[21:10.690 --> 21:14.970]  point right so a tree the tree has got its roots down in that bedrock where it's
[21:14.970 --> 21:20.970]  looking for water and we know a tree is gonna be able to actually break rock
[21:20.970 --> 21:25.450]  it'll it'll get in there and it's got the ability to move through to seek
[21:25.450 --> 21:32.850]  after water when it's got time and it's got a root mass spread out the size of
[21:32.850 --> 21:37.290]  its crown so it has all this energy available to it to if it needs to seek
[21:37.290 --> 21:42.610]  out the water in the lowest places in the bedrock and it's going to do that
[21:42.610 --> 21:48.010]  one of one of the films about ten months ago one of the professors was
[21:48.010 --> 21:53.610]  talking about how how heavy a soil various things can move through and
[21:53.610 --> 21:58.410]  using a tensiometer I'm sorry a pinotentrometer
[21:58.410 --> 22:02.450]  enteometer measures water pressure in the soil or plant and the
[22:02.450 --> 22:07.530]  pentatometer is used to determine how much compaction there is in the soil and
[22:07.770 --> 22:15.730]  he's discussing how sand is like a 20 and nothing and clay is the heavy soils
[22:15.730 --> 22:23.850]  or heavier harder get through and and so he was talking about how a weed can push
[22:23.850 --> 22:29.330]  through like 800 psi and a feeder root from a braces plant can move through
[22:29.330 --> 22:37.090]  like 300 and a captain be like 400 and a tree or seeking water but if everything
[22:37.090 --> 22:41.490]  is got straight at the surface you know even the trees in my front yard are the
[22:41.490 --> 22:44.250]  roots are right the surfaces because that's where it gets watered and it
[22:44.250 --> 22:49.330]  doesn't have to go deep so most of us are used to our cannabis plant having
[22:49.330 --> 22:55.930]  roots up the surface not noticing that they actually will dive deep and when
[22:55.930 --> 23:00.730]  I've grown in wild land taproot is the essential element going on there but
[23:00.730 --> 23:07.170]  it's going after water and it's not it's feeding from the upper surface
[23:07.170 --> 23:15.210]  where all the plant matter is breaking down and alright so we know there's a
[23:15.210 --> 23:18.570]  difference here and where these plants are feeding how they're feeding because
[23:18.570 --> 23:24.890]  it's a difference in time and natural structure of these plants and so trying
[23:24.890 --> 23:32.330]  to copy what we're going to grow an herb or tomato or a food plant that
[23:32.330 --> 23:37.530]  grows for three months or six months and bringing that into a controlled
[23:37.530 --> 23:42.770]  intensive environment and assuming it that is we want to build what a tree is
[23:42.770 --> 23:48.250]  growing in is the base misnomer or
[23:49.250 --> 23:58.050]  that's someplace we shouldn't be starting with so there were some other
[23:58.050 --> 24:01.650]  reasons though why the concept of putting rocks at the bottom were there
[24:01.650 --> 24:07.210]  and part of that had to do I was touching on the the fines that start
[24:07.210 --> 24:15.290]  building up and that's that's a part of a process that it can occur if we've
[24:15.290 --> 24:19.650]  overloaded our organic matter
[24:21.130 --> 24:25.090]  especially if we put what they're living worms in the system that are actually
[24:25.090 --> 24:29.770]  actively breaking it down and they're rate faster than our plant is utilizing
[24:29.770 --> 24:38.770]  and we're re-adding more aeration capacity so you know in nature you've
[24:38.770 --> 24:48.090]  got rodents you've got reptiles you've got you got worms you got all sorts of
[24:48.090 --> 24:53.570]  insects and stuff that are burrowing creating holes and in these lower humic
[24:53.570 --> 25:00.970]  layers and such but there's also that that's where that's where the redox
[25:00.970 --> 25:05.370]  happens when when the less air moves and you get these mullet situations and
[25:05.450 --> 25:10.130]  there's different ways of dealing with that starting with more sand right a
[25:10.130 --> 25:16.250]  coarse sand though not not a fine sand never a coarse sand I do use lava rocks
[25:16.250 --> 25:30.530]  I use old I use old not Grodin I'm sorry Oh the little clay pellets right for
[25:30.530 --> 25:40.970]  drainage in my hydro soil hydrant systems let's see drainage though it's
[25:40.970 --> 25:44.090]  ancient it's been known forever my grandmother taught me how to break a
[25:44.090 --> 25:47.330]  clay pot and put it at the bottom of the pot so we can have proper soil
[25:47.330 --> 25:53.930]  drainage still a clay pot has a lifespan even in Southern California it wore out
[25:53.930 --> 25:59.290]  after ten years right and your top dressing and it's plant in there in
[25:59.290 --> 26:03.850]  organic situation and you might get a little bit of fine porn out that face
[26:03.850 --> 26:09.170]  hole but ten years that pops done you got to pop the thing up the plant has it
[26:09.170 --> 26:14.970]  outgrown in that period of time and utilizing intensive agriculture
[26:14.970 --> 26:18.890]  horticulture for growing cannabis even if we want to build what we call a
[26:18.890 --> 26:28.610]  permanent bed those structures all have lifespans as well as we're doing
[26:28.610 --> 26:32.050]  intensive agriculture we're not doing passive agriculture not growing trees
[26:32.050 --> 26:37.170]  out in the forest and so you have to take that into accommodation and in your
[26:37.170 --> 26:43.250]  entire management equation and growing growing something in your backyard and
[26:43.250 --> 26:47.210]  letting it set up and let it go is a different story
[26:48.490 --> 26:52.770]  maximization could possibly be that you don't ever put any more input into it
[26:52.770 --> 27:00.210]  and you might have to change your genetic input at that point something
[27:00.210 --> 27:09.530]  that is more adapt to a native wild soil right land race land race with Drake and
[27:09.530 --> 27:13.890]  a heavier soil with less food in it I think a lot of land races don't like me
[27:13.890 --> 27:23.420]  fed the same way or polyhydrate yeah I keep trying to look at chat but I don't
[27:23.420 --> 27:29.980]  see anything so I'm not paying attention over there yeah don't don't worry about
[27:29.980 --> 27:38.580]  I'm back by the way well freshly stocked with some family tree seeds so nice
[27:38.580 --> 27:45.260]  nice um yeah so I was just touching on the time parameters of artificial
[27:45.260 --> 27:51.340]  structures and intensive agriculture go ahead and show those off though that's a
[27:51.340 --> 27:58.980]  nice bundle of seeds you got that's gonna go I gotta go through it but yeah
[27:58.980 --> 28:04.900]  there's some of the old stuff and then some new stuff but uh anyway that's that
[28:04.900 --> 28:18.700]  was my my quick handoff at outside nice so Michael thank you for did Inga and
[28:18.700 --> 28:24.620]  John make a cameo that's my he's Michael who lives closest to my parents
[28:24.620 --> 28:32.220]  gets to do all the the the tech support he's like their their life manager for
[28:32.220 --> 28:43.790]  my 90 year old dad and my 84 year old mom let me unmute you I know that's
[28:43.790 --> 28:47.350]  weird that you can't unmute all right well Michael is very quiet he can't
[28:47.350 --> 28:56.350]  unmute himself but uh nice anyway thank you and we will carry on everyone's
[28:56.350 --> 29:00.870]  introduction to Michael who hopefully will be producing some of the shows so I
[29:00.870 --> 29:09.910]  don't have to all the time go ahead I was gonna say I've got container for
[29:09.910 --> 29:15.590]  instance like black tote I don't I don't use smart pot myself it's way too dry in
[29:15.590 --> 29:21.030]  the atmosphere I do use at times I've experimented with and if I was doing
[29:21.030 --> 29:27.990]  more production than breeding I would probably use the like cloth shopping
[29:27.990 --> 29:34.270]  bags in my emic system ecosystem imagery energy cycling systems which is a
[29:34.270 --> 29:43.110]  combinations of vermicomposting Bishop I got them and then various hydroponic and
[29:43.110 --> 29:50.070]  soil combinations so I use that in flow and I use NFT systems those are the two
[29:50.070 --> 29:55.190]  main ways I do that and I do have to use drainage I do put a layer in the bottom
[29:55.190 --> 30:00.350]  I've experimented with all sorts of different layering actually trying to
[30:00.350 --> 30:04.790]  figure these things out and something I just clicked though is this stuff was
[30:04.790 --> 30:10.830]  brought up in soil science classes and in college and in and the answer that
[30:10.830 --> 30:16.710]  came from the professors was yes we are doing horizontal soil planting and in
[30:16.710 --> 30:20.910]  containers and we're just using the Oh horizon we were copying nature and
[30:20.910 --> 30:26.350]  that's where everything grows that's where all the life is taking place the
[30:26.350 --> 30:38.150]  horizon is not 100% organic matter it okay let's let's go to my soil science
[30:38.150 --> 30:43.390]  professors they basically you they contracted there two of the guys my
[30:43.390 --> 30:48.030]  three main professors were on the team of five I believe it was that invented
[30:48.030 --> 30:54.430]  the two-part series hydroponic for NASA that's the standard original stuff that
[30:54.430 --> 30:59.750]  everything derived from it's now a three-part we won't even say the name
[30:59.750 --> 31:05.070]  that shall not be mentioned that owns the companies now but anyhow they when
[31:05.070 --> 31:11.150]  we talked about soil and perfect soil and in this whole discussion got me
[31:11.150 --> 31:21.750]  thinking about why why was that and it made so much sense the original besides
[31:21.750 --> 31:28.590]  rock wool was a three-part soilless medium and it's pearlite it's
[31:28.590 --> 31:38.950]  vermiculite and it's it's sphagnum peat moss not peat bog moss okay and so let's
[31:38.950 --> 31:43.710]  see can we see here this is clay this is the Montmore Morillonite clay it's a
[31:43.710 --> 31:50.550]  powder right this is what they use for sealing wells you put a little bit of
[31:50.550 --> 31:54.190]  stuff around it and it holds water and it seals and nothing can come and go you
[31:54.310 --> 32:00.870]  can't get any shit in there's in your well and it expands twice the size or
[32:00.870 --> 32:05.190]  more when you add water to it that's that the water doesn't pass past it once
[32:05.190 --> 32:17.070]  it expands okay that's clay yeah and it's it's a it's a powder right clay is
[32:17.070 --> 32:22.030]  a particle size and it's also a chemical structure this here is vermiculite
[32:22.030 --> 32:30.950]  vermiculite is a clay so if you can all right so so anymore most people only use
[32:30.950 --> 32:39.830]  this for their mushroom substrates but it is I can't show the layers here it's
[32:39.830 --> 32:45.350]  stack layer it's mica that's been heated and expanded and but the vermiculite is
[32:45.350 --> 32:55.510]  a technical name for a particular species of clay it's not a expanding
[32:55.510 --> 32:59.910]  clay the same way the Montmore Morillonites are the stuff that you
[32:59.910 --> 33:05.990]  might get a out of a riverbank may or may not be an expanding clay but they
[33:05.990 --> 33:14.350]  tend to be the color of that clay is going to tell you a lot about its nature
[33:14.950 --> 33:20.750]  yellows reds they've been leached out except the brown the darker the color or
[33:20.750 --> 33:29.350]  something is always mean this it's got more richness to it so vermiculite
[33:29.350 --> 33:34.830]  perlite here's a nice fine perlite there's larger structure perlite and and
[33:34.830 --> 33:40.750]  and I know there's all sorts of debate over all this stuff as far as its
[33:40.790 --> 33:46.230]  ecological viability but what I want to show you is what these things are that
[33:46.230 --> 33:57.390]  we've built from to get to where we are now right and then of course the fine
[33:58.630 --> 34:07.070]  sphagnum peat moss right so those those three were the main things in and so
[34:07.110 --> 34:14.630]  holds water and has the CCC the cation exchange sites that's where all the
[34:14.630 --> 34:18.230]  nutrients get held if you're just putting the salt fertilizer in there
[34:18.230 --> 34:29.310]  right I wonder is that me you can hear that too yeah I turned off my speaker
[34:29.310 --> 34:32.310]  system here that might have been me right next to my phone I had to turn
[34:32.350 --> 34:37.470]  down all right so sphagnum is going to hold
[34:37.470 --> 34:42.990]  both water and it's gonna break down it's gonna be and it'll hold nutrient as
[34:42.990 --> 34:53.030]  well and it holds air and we need air and so perlite is lots and lots of air
[34:53.030 --> 34:56.310]  we can we can listen to some of the professors telling us how much air
[34:56.430 --> 35:04.150]  things need and there you need quite a bit of oxygen the the pressure the
[35:04.150 --> 35:15.750]  density of your soil needs to be below 200 psi for our our micro biota our
[35:15.750 --> 35:21.310]  fungi and our bacteria especially the fungal hyphae for them to penetrate to
[35:21.310 --> 35:24.710]  the soil and get around and to where the food is and where the plant roots are
[35:24.710 --> 35:28.870]  and where these exchanges of acids and things are happening that stimulate
[35:28.870 --> 35:38.110]  through enzymes and so if you have soil denser than that 200 psi your fungus
[35:38.110 --> 35:41.030]  ain't gonna grow there your roots might and you can get direct contact and
[35:41.030 --> 35:46.310]  there's still got to be enough oxygen for the roots to be happy so when we get
[35:46.310 --> 35:51.350]  too much fines in the bottom yes this becomes a problem if we have forethought
[35:51.350 --> 35:55.470]  we can avoid that problem from occurring okay and where it occurs from
[35:55.470 --> 36:01.790]  is is breaking the law of don't be greedy and people said this much is the
[36:01.790 --> 36:05.270]  standard American thing doesn't matter what we're doing if this much is good
[36:05.270 --> 36:09.670]  this much is gonna be better no follow the recipe these guys have been working
[36:09.670 --> 36:14.150]  on this for a long time right now I got some recipes but I don't even put them
[36:14.150 --> 36:22.710]  because there's so many awesome recipes it's um it's I why I do all this stuff
[36:22.710 --> 36:26.990]  in my head I have a hard time doing the math as I'm learning and people do
[36:26.990 --> 36:34.950]  numbers numbers are great I actually like just bought a PPM meter for the
[36:34.950 --> 36:39.990]  first time last year right I've never used one in 35 years growing back there
[36:39.990 --> 36:43.790]  you know we need to see what I'm doing with these FPJs and these in this
[36:44.510 --> 36:49.670]  I do everything by and my mind is so complex I keep track of shit
[36:49.670 --> 36:58.390]  subconsciously and then plant leaf response and stuff like that but so so
[36:58.390 --> 37:03.910]  we've got air we've got we've got the EC we've got moisture holding capacity and
[37:03.910 --> 37:10.150]  those three things are covered in the most basic soilless medium right so we
[37:10.150 --> 37:14.110]  don't want to use hydroponic salts do we we all agree that that's not what we
[37:14.110 --> 37:18.150]  really necessarily want to be but even if that's where you're at you understand
[37:18.150 --> 37:22.830]  now this is why we use such a medium like that you want those three things
[37:22.830 --> 37:28.230]  being in there but if we took those and mix them in equal parts of thirds and
[37:28.230 --> 37:32.990]  and that's kind of like the base of any bag of potting soil that you're gonna
[37:32.990 --> 37:38.070]  buy so you want to save some money and some energy go buy yourself bales of
[37:38.070 --> 37:43.950]  those three things right if you're so inclined to utilize those items for me
[37:43.950 --> 37:50.390]  perlites produced less than 80 miles from my house and locality is massive
[37:50.390 --> 37:56.910]  the old man coots is described and will tell you where to look for the
[37:56.910 --> 38:02.590]  information that it tells us that sphagnum peat moss is not the bog peat
[38:02.590 --> 38:06.710]  moss that the psychological mind trip is used on when they're telling us like oh
[38:06.710 --> 38:13.950]  it's evil to dig our co2 sink and it's these are two totally different
[38:13.950 --> 38:21.530]  biological occurrences on the face of the earth so I'm in and for me in my
[38:21.530 --> 38:28.270]  view my perspective in my place using the sphagnum is the correct thing I do
[38:28.270 --> 38:35.590]  like that Mexican cocoa stuff I've used cocoa I've experimented with cocoa my
[38:35.590 --> 38:43.310]  issues with cocoa are the long-distance transport and you know you hear people
[38:43.310 --> 38:48.750]  talk about child labor I'll also mention orangutans I like a ring of tanks and I
[38:48.750 --> 38:52.990]  might be confused with palm oil but so there's different ways of looking at
[38:52.990 --> 38:57.030]  things and why we might see this or that the other thing is being superior
[38:57.030 --> 39:03.070]  inferior well so we want to we want to build ourselves an organic soil so if
[39:03.070 --> 39:06.950]  you go buy a bag of soil it's gonna be basically these things or possibly
[39:06.950 --> 39:12.150]  pumice possibly rice holes you know like that I hydroton that's what those little
[39:12.150 --> 39:23.230]  clay balls are and lava rock are common in my garden the the entire pot is that
[39:23.230 --> 39:29.270]  overrides we want to mix a soil that is if you look on my Instagram you'll see a
[39:29.430 --> 39:34.790]  not very colorful and thinly lined soil structure chart and it's kind of a
[39:34.790 --> 39:40.630]  triangle and the sweet spot is alone that's that under 200 psi where you're
[39:40.630 --> 39:44.230]  fun you can grow and your plants can reach their roots wherever they want and
[39:44.230 --> 39:51.870]  and everything just fills that entire space just like by see a little map you
[39:51.870 --> 39:56.830]  want you want that entire space being occupied for maximum returns in our in
[39:57.590 --> 40:04.230]  growing season where I live is it is it this one do you see the one that I just
[40:04.230 --> 40:08.110]  put up yeah that's that's it right there yep so loam right in the middle that's
[40:08.110 --> 40:13.230]  our that's our real target right in in my comments there I point out you know
[40:13.230 --> 40:20.790]  reality it's the space between idealism and survival right we got a you don't
[40:20.790 --> 40:25.190]  all have budgets I don't have a budget I quite often I'm working hand-to-mouth
[40:25.310 --> 40:32.590]  and putting inputs in when I can and I'm paying the bills late but but it's it's
[40:32.590 --> 40:38.590]  that loam space right there is really what we want on a soil structure and it
[40:38.590 --> 40:43.030]  really doesn't not a whole lot of things in our garden that don't thrive in that
[40:43.030 --> 40:47.550]  right and that's that's we're tilling you know and yes we're all heading
[40:47.550 --> 40:51.750]  towards no till because we understand that worms and fungi will hold that
[40:51.750 --> 40:58.030]  structure in there tilling can take a heavy clay and turn it into that feeling
[40:58.030 --> 41:04.150]  when you put your hand into that loam and it's this nice soft earth and roots
[41:04.150 --> 41:07.630]  can for three months do their thing in that but what have we done we've
[41:07.630 --> 41:13.350]  compressed below that we've killed off our biota in the zone that we ran our
[41:13.350 --> 41:18.070]  tiller and all those things so we're all moving towards this no till concept which
[41:18.110 --> 41:24.390]  is great and again though in an intensive agricultural system we're not
[41:24.390 --> 41:32.150]  doing passive agriculture so so there's the spectrum of your backyard to a
[41:32.150 --> 41:42.910]  commercial grow and what inputs you have available to you and things like that so
[41:42.910 --> 41:47.910]  you buy that bag of soil it's mixed like this you mix it up yourself and it does
[41:47.910 --> 41:52.390]  not have enough to get you much past your vegetative state growth of whatever
[41:52.390 --> 41:58.230]  it is you're growing so we want to charge it with the goodness and and we
[41:58.230 --> 42:05.550]  know quite emphatically from listening to from your culture lectures and so
[42:05.550 --> 42:10.510]  many other positions that that Burma compost is the bomb that's the stuff we
[42:10.510 --> 42:16.310]  want to add in there and if we if we take that these three if I take these
[42:16.310 --> 42:21.510]  three and mix them perfectly together in thirds and then I think another half
[42:21.510 --> 42:30.070]  take that right sorry hold that up again okay so it's vermiculite perlite and
[42:30.070 --> 42:37.510]  peat moss sphagnum peat moss okay so that is that is the basis of what these
[42:37.510 --> 42:43.710]  soil scientists the they really know their shit that's what they're saying
[42:43.710 --> 42:50.750]  that's like the perfect soilless medium right it has no life in it so that's
[42:50.750 --> 42:56.070]  when we it goes from dirt to life right when we have that life sustaining it's
[42:56.070 --> 43:00.710]  the rise of spirits where the life occurs so we want this to be a living
[43:00.710 --> 43:05.230]  soil we want to add life into it in our
[43:05.230 --> 43:12.310]  our additions is going to be preferably that compost and preferably it's that
[43:12.310 --> 43:20.790]  worm compost and why those microbes that we so desire that it's so similar
[43:20.790 --> 43:27.630]  to what is dominant in an old-growth forest is what's occurring in a
[43:27.630 --> 43:36.790]  well-aged compost and that's both thermal and vermicompost okay and you
[43:36.790 --> 43:40.590]  know if your yard is devoid if your space is devoid of these things it does
[43:40.590 --> 43:47.830]  not take a whole lot to inoculate and bring up microbial populations as long
[43:47.830 --> 43:57.150]  as the conditions are there for them to exist and so mineralization there's very
[43:57.150 --> 44:01.470]  few microbes that do that think about lichen right those are those are a
[44:01.470 --> 44:07.750]  bacterial fungal symbiosis that occurs it occurs in full air it does not help
[44:07.750 --> 44:18.070]  occur in a subterranean existence it utilizes both free spa it utilizes
[44:18.070 --> 44:23.710]  acidic rain it creates a acidic condition for rainwater in its space
[44:23.710 --> 44:29.630]  there's a little little layer between the symbiotic mat that we call a plant
[44:29.630 --> 44:35.790]  that is lichen and the rock itself and in between that zone there those there's
[44:36.030 --> 44:39.510]  they're putting off their exit they're doing their thing the water comes in
[44:39.510 --> 44:45.110]  there rain free stuff all that stuff is breaking down the rock a rate of
[44:45.110 --> 44:51.430]  millimeters for hundreds of years or you know if we look up in Yosemite at the
[44:51.430 --> 44:58.950]  glacial compressed granite the sheen is still there after 30,000 years of being
[44:58.950 --> 45:03.750]  freeze-thaw exposed has lichen all over it and stuff okay the stuff ain't
[45:03.750 --> 45:12.950]  contributing unless you have extremely soft rocks that are just breaking down
[45:12.950 --> 45:30.780]  in an acidic environment like limestone okay so and in the studies I show it
[45:30.780 --> 45:36.300]  tells us that that calcium is the number one thing that breaks down in natural
[45:36.300 --> 45:46.260]  soil in a forest in a high rainfall acidic soil forest that has a
[45:46.260 --> 45:53.460]  metamorphic sedimentary rock that's composed highly of calcium carbonate and
[45:53.460 --> 45:59.020]  so we're gonna have calcium added to a hectare of soil at a rate of about a
[45:59.020 --> 46:04.140]  kilogram per hectare in that soil column if we make an assumption that that soil
[46:04.260 --> 46:08.580]  is only three feet deep like we have one of our pots or planters and we reduce
[46:08.580 --> 46:12.060]  that and Peter already showed them this chicken scratch math it just kind of
[46:12.060 --> 46:16.420]  lays this out that basically comes down to about if we make those assumptions
[46:16.420 --> 46:21.620]  that everything is in perfect conditions the acidity is there reduxes occurring
[46:21.620 --> 46:26.460]  throughout the entire column and we have all the microbes and perfect conditions
[46:26.460 --> 46:33.420]  to the entire column we can expect about 320 milligrams of car calcium to be
[46:33.500 --> 46:40.140]  contributed to that soil column in a full year if it was the same as that
[46:40.140 --> 46:43.820]  perfect forest that you're doing experimentation and observations in
[46:43.820 --> 46:52.180]  about two tablets of chewable so everything else is considerably less
[46:52.180 --> 47:01.220]  than that in that highly mineral I'm sorry weathering zone okay so you need
[47:01.220 --> 47:07.980]  lots of rainfall to create these acidic conditions and then you also need the
[47:07.980 --> 47:13.220]  right kind of rocks that are gonna break down and anything that's not a
[47:13.220 --> 47:16.580]  sedimentary metamorphic isn't gonna break down as fast as something that's
[47:16.580 --> 47:28.660]  a crystalline igneous intrusive so one rock that I do utilize is lava because
[47:28.660 --> 47:35.220]  it has pores and pores are a good thing but let's step back a little bit though
[47:35.220 --> 47:41.820]  with calcium it also like nitrate available the catalytic available
[47:41.820 --> 47:49.660]  nitrogen is nitrate and that's a nitrogen three oxygens attached and that
[47:49.660 --> 47:56.500]  has to get changed by microbes from plants or taken out of the air put into
[47:56.540 --> 48:04.420]  the plant then become mineralized by microbes to become available but as
[48:04.420 --> 48:07.460]  soon as it's available it moves through the soil column at the speed of water
[48:07.460 --> 48:14.460]  and calcium only moves down nitrogen actually it will move with the water if
[48:14.460 --> 48:19.220]  you have a vapor evaporation in the soil it'll move your nitrogen back up but
[48:19.220 --> 48:25.700]  generally it's bleaching your calcium is leaching and that production in that
[48:25.700 --> 48:29.860]  column that I just described is considerably less than what you would
[48:29.860 --> 48:37.460]  put in from your hose watering that water column so the the point of putting
[48:37.460 --> 48:46.100]  rocks in and in larger colloid the larger pieces of material for microbes
[48:46.100 --> 48:53.660]  to mine is a nice idea but it's just completely negligible in our lifetime
[48:53.660 --> 49:00.580]  for intensive agriculture so there was another purpose to putting rocks in the
[49:00.580 --> 49:09.660]  in the bottom would be we drainage and again if your soil is set up properly
[49:09.660 --> 49:15.620]  you're never going to get to a point where drainage is an issue in an earth
[49:15.620 --> 49:23.300]  box where it's bottom fed this is when things really started clicking for me
[49:23.340 --> 49:26.980]  when I was looking at what was going on with the anaerobic fermentation with
[49:26.980 --> 49:31.900]  faculty of anaerobes being taught in probiotic farmers alliance and it was
[49:31.900 --> 49:36.900]  new and I was first introduced it took me it took me several months to really
[49:36.900 --> 49:46.820]  grasp transitioning from fully aerobic conditions to the capacity of dealing
[49:46.820 --> 49:51.260]  with anaerobic and in well we weren't necessarily growing anaerobic conditions
[49:51.260 --> 49:59.940]  in an earth box or in probiotic growing concepts we're fermenting feeds when
[49:59.940 --> 50:03.380]  you're first starting to get everything up to speed or if you're learning or
[50:03.380 --> 50:08.900]  doing some of the more complex stuff that I got into where I'm doing all these
[50:08.900 --> 50:13.900]  ferments bacterial degradation mineralization and liquid anaerobic
[50:13.900 --> 50:20.820]  conditions to run my hydro organic systems this is one of the most complex
[50:20.900 --> 50:25.540]  things I've ever done who is to ferment the plant matter and feed it directly
[50:25.540 --> 50:30.060]  into a hydro system with a little bit of soil and you've got to have this
[50:30.060 --> 50:34.860]  drainage layer in those parts or you're sucking up anaerobic system in the heart
[50:34.860 --> 50:40.580]  of the small pot right I experienced these things I experienced the fines
[50:40.580 --> 50:46.260]  settling out in top feeds and bottom feeds and such and so I'm very much
[50:46.260 --> 50:52.740]  aware of this and I also have I have hard side because they said I don't use
[50:52.740 --> 50:58.020]  so much smart pots because it's so dry here I do have a like a 30 gallon tote
[50:58.020 --> 51:08.500]  that's six years and 20 cycles in the top feeding and it rages no problem it's
[51:08.500 --> 51:12.660]  got a crack in the bottom and that's it for drainage out the bottom and properly
[51:12.660 --> 51:19.340]  mixed soil to start with and it got to a point where it seemed like there was
[51:19.340 --> 51:23.740]  having issues with worms and and what did I do was I took a bag of manure and
[51:23.740 --> 51:27.740]  cracked it open on the top of it and so there was contact between the soil and
[51:27.740 --> 51:34.020]  the manure and all the worms crawled into the bag of manure and I put them
[51:34.020 --> 51:38.260]  somewhere else and so you know they had babies later and stuff but eventually
[51:38.260 --> 51:43.580]  it's it's uh there wasn't more worms I started out with too many worms right
[51:43.580 --> 51:47.220]  and this is the thing that can happen in your beds is you put way too many worms
[51:47.220 --> 51:52.220]  in or you get a live worm casting with tons of cysts in it that are ready to
[51:52.220 --> 51:56.340]  hatch out they end up taking over but the other is you might have way too much
[51:56.340 --> 52:02.780]  organic matter that's food to begin with you might not have enough aeration for
[52:02.780 --> 52:08.180]  all the roots to move throughout and so a lot of stuff I'm talking I don't
[52:08.180 --> 52:12.420]  have anything on my Instagram yet but I'm planning on putting together some
[52:12.420 --> 52:18.460]  short videos in short posts describe this stuff show when I'm breaking up for
[52:18.460 --> 52:23.500]  instance when I'm breeding I do a lot of intensive potting moving things around
[52:23.500 --> 52:29.460]  so I can call or stress test or move them from one system to another I
[52:29.460 --> 52:34.100]  actually have I call myself the king closet checker because I have nine
[52:34.100 --> 52:40.860]  closets but they're not really closets greenhouses and things it so I have to
[52:40.860 --> 52:43.700]  be able to move things around in small pots and I'm able to test for root
[52:43.700 --> 52:50.580]  binding and actively actually inducing issues with with root rot for instance
[52:50.580 --> 52:55.340]  it's something I do to see how my genetics respond for people who run
[52:55.340 --> 53:01.660]  hydroponics or if you want you to plant down by the creek you know in my early
[53:01.740 --> 53:06.220]  days I did used to go plant down by the creek I'd take bare-rooted cannabis
[53:06.220 --> 53:11.380]  plants and stick them in the gravels down by the creek and see how things
[53:11.380 --> 53:17.220]  worked right and I would take potting soil pots and dig holes up on the ridges
[53:17.220 --> 53:25.220]  and see how it worked and am I digging into a parent material am I digging into
[53:25.220 --> 53:33.620]  unconsolidated rock am I digging into organic matter and in nature after it
[53:33.620 --> 53:41.140]  was literally 30 years of trying and probably a good 26 years of Johnny
[53:41.140 --> 53:47.340]  Johnny seeding I finally found the spot that in nature the cannabis seed that is
[53:47.340 --> 53:53.900]  not totally bred to being grown in a paper towel could drop its taproot and
[53:54.060 --> 53:58.740]  find water while still having enough nutrient in the upper surface and what
[53:58.740 --> 54:04.580]  it was was actually a landscape renewal there had been a landslide and
[54:04.580 --> 54:10.220]  effectively hundreds of tons of dynamite was blown up on the side of the mountain
[54:10.220 --> 54:15.940]  mmm a house-sized boulder cut loose and dropped down a cliff a thousand feet and
[54:16.260 --> 54:23.980]  ended up taking another quite a few several garage sized boulders with it
[54:23.980 --> 54:29.620]  and completely churned the soil completely sheared trees and buried them
[54:29.620 --> 54:36.380]  broke rock and everything and that mix of decomposed granite and old growth
[54:36.380 --> 54:42.780]  soil that had just been mixed produced the best plants I have ever grown far
[54:42.780 --> 54:49.340]  hands down none it had the microbes the old the old growth for soil was all
[54:49.340 --> 54:56.300]  mixed up at the aeration and the plant was able to reach down through when the
[54:56.300 --> 55:03.020]  soil was still moist and all they were fed was sunshine decomposed granite and
[55:03.020 --> 55:10.140]  and thunderstorms very little rain actually very little water so it's
[55:10.140 --> 55:16.140]  extremely aerated system there that in nature and so my earliest posts on the
[55:16.140 --> 55:22.460]  Instagram you can see that stuff growing right out of rock cracks and or the ones
[55:22.460 --> 55:25.820]  in the rock cracks were extremely scraggly little things but when they are
[55:25.820 --> 55:28.860]  in that mixed soil in the first and second year after that landslide they
[55:28.860 --> 55:37.340]  were massive trees like the forest around it so they had all the nutrients
[55:37.340 --> 55:41.980]  they had all the microbes they had there was native there was bugs attacking it up there
[55:41.980 --> 55:49.300]  there's also predators attacking the bad bugs it's pretty awesome to watch and
[55:49.300 --> 55:56.540]  observe but you know again that was still besides the fact that it wasn't
[55:56.540 --> 56:01.980]  being watered it had dropped taproot it was all feeding that upper section all
[56:01.980 --> 56:06.420]  that loose unconsolidated that the microbes were able to move through and
[56:06.420 --> 56:12.340]  it had oxygen so things that things that how do we deal with it you don't
[56:12.340 --> 56:18.500]  want to dig up your bed completely some of the early organic growing methods
[56:18.500 --> 56:28.860]  that I was taught was trenching our ground and we would trench like every
[56:28.860 --> 56:32.860]  third row and you'd lay in all your organic matter into there so you can
[56:32.860 --> 56:39.020]  trench into your commercial beds in between planting zones and lay in lava
[56:39.020 --> 56:43.020]  rocks down into the bottom if you would need to deal with some of that you can
[56:43.020 --> 56:49.940]  mine out your humic matter your humus your completely digested verbi compost
[56:49.940 --> 56:55.020]  that settles in that's what plants crave that's the brondo that's the real deal
[56:55.020 --> 57:00.660]  so it's not actually a problem it's managing it and so but how long does it
[57:00.660 --> 57:03.740]  take for that to build up to a point where even if you made the mistake and
[57:03.740 --> 57:09.120]  got greedy at the beginning and put too much organic matter in it's everyone I
[57:09.120 --> 57:13.260]  hear talking about it it's a three to five year process that that you're
[57:13.260 --> 57:17.380]  dealing with before you start going man my soil got really heavy with with
[57:17.380 --> 57:24.180]  organic humus oh by the way if you're building your soil you can buy humates
[57:24.180 --> 57:31.580]  right and this is literally this is shale rock from between coal seams and
[57:31.580 --> 57:35.940]  it's really funny is the amount of inputs that every one of you have in
[57:35.940 --> 57:39.620]  your garden that come from right here in Utah this comes from down near price
[57:39.620 --> 57:50.380]  Utah and then we also have azomite and this is this is pelleted and this does
[57:50.380 --> 57:54.220]  but it's been crushed and then pelletized and that's the stuff that
[57:54.220 --> 58:01.780]  you want in your Oh horizon that we mix in in rock dusts right we have our
[58:01.780 --> 58:09.660]  calcium carbonates we have humates you can get lingonite which is another
[58:09.660 --> 58:23.500]  crust shale that provide okay we've got by Tamesha sir all right very very very
[58:23.500 --> 58:28.820]  very fine right the stuff is but this is what this is what the microbes can eat
[58:28.820 --> 58:35.940]  they can't they can't eat one inch square rocks if you need if you need
[58:35.940 --> 58:40.780]  drainage down I don't have any right here um I got a cactus it doesn't have
[58:40.780 --> 58:44.820]  um if you need drainage at the bottom there again digging in you can dig in
[58:44.820 --> 58:48.700]  wood chips into the bottom and they're not going to be detrimental to your
[58:48.700 --> 58:55.620]  system right again I explained how my wood chips in saying that the wood chips
[58:55.620 --> 59:02.860]  rob nitrogen is a misnomer as well nitrogen is hardly available especially
[59:02.860 --> 59:07.180]  using it on the top like I said it leaches immediately as soon as it's
[59:07.180 --> 59:10.980]  available and it's not next to a root or something that can immobilize it by
[59:10.980 --> 59:17.940]  becoming part of another living structure it leaches as soon as it's
[59:17.940 --> 59:22.860]  available so so your wood chips aren't really Robin those microbes are
[59:22.860 --> 59:26.860]  immobilizing it and it's banking it and and I didn't get this picture up on my
[59:26.860 --> 59:31.220]  Instagram yet but I have a chart in my wonderful science book that it's let me
[59:31.220 --> 59:36.220]  make sure we have this is Raymond Miller and Roy Donahue introduction to
[59:36.220 --> 59:41.420]  soils and plant growth and and there are photos there I posted the cover to make
[59:41.420 --> 59:48.140]  sure I'm giving them credit when I post the pictures but it's it talks about
[59:48.140 --> 59:55.220]  alfalfa and oat straw getting killed in and the nitrogen levels in the soil
[59:55.220 --> 01:00:00.660]  comparatively to baseline and planting times and things like that but basically
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:08.980]  oat straw is like 80 to 1 carbon nitrogen and alfalfa is closer to 20 25
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:13.460]  to 1 I think or 21 so so you're basically you're putting nitrogen in we
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:18.900]  know that the alfalfa takes nitrogen out of the air and mostly mostly legumes are
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:22.700]  putting it actually into the seed the bean itself but it's in the plant
[01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:26.380]  matters where all this goes and so when you till it back in and it mineralizes
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:31.020]  that's when it becomes available for plants but oats don't really do that
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:36.460]  they eat nitrogen primarily and put it into their seed as well and and so but
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:42.060]  it's like a six-week period if you have any sort of living stuff in your farm
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:47.220]  and and a lot of misnomer is that salts kill the farm and all farms are dead and
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:52.260]  that's that's honestly not true most farms even if they're using synthetic
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:59.180]  stuff they're they're actually not completely dead I found and that ranges
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:03.820]  it definitely ranges the bigger the commercial system the probably closer to
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:07.700]  dead it is even in commercial organic programs they're not necessarily a
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:17.300]  living system it's it's there have certified inputs so but the straw is
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:21.460]  just banking for six weeks and again it started then it starts releasing so
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:26.700]  which if it's the same thing it has a smaller surface ratio and it's also
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:31.540]  feeding all these other fungal fungus that are sapotrophs that are breaking it
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:37.980]  down and so it's actually part of the system it's it's I use I like wood chips
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:44.220]  for top dressing and I also believe that they can be used just fine for aeration
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:49.340]  if that's what you've got if you have a major issue it's a long-term thing for
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.780]  them to break down and of course you have some people are gonna say no no no
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:56.420]  no no you can't do that well one of the things I want to show in my when I break
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:01.100]  down a pot of soil is why in the long term when I have everything balanced of
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:07.340]  the fines don't end up being a problem because the entire structure becomes
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:13.620]  organic matter roots right and then those roots break down and but more
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:16.340]  roots able to grow in right next to where those roots were and if you have
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:19.780]  your fungus in place now I'm mixing my soil every time so I have an exact same
[01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:25.100]  mix for every group of specimens every stem and a breeding project needs to
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:31.340]  have the same so I have to if you know I do keep large containers set aside for
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:37.580]  when I want to do what a plant does and as large containers and but but so I'm
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:44.420]  seeing this when my soil is properly aerated it's properly inoculated with
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:51.020]  microbes and it has a good balance of nutrients the entire plant column the
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:57.820]  entire soil column maximizes occupancy with fungus and root and then so when
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:02.020]  that's dead again I'm not having a problem with settling everything is it
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:09.380]  becomes mineralized is again utilized and so we want to have that balance to
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:14.300]  begin with and so where I was I was starting to say yeah we have our three
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:22.740]  part soil is medium structure base that creates a perfect growing space for
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:26.300]  plants so if you understand what those three or feel like and what they're
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:32.860]  doing chemically and structurally you can improvise from that to produce with
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:41.500]  whatever you have locally whether it's leaf or straw or if it's roots if it's
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:46.300]  sticks right you know you go out and look at nature look at the soil what is
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:54.340]  the soil comprised of what's growing through so so taking that three-part
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:04:02.700]  mixture and making it live we are taking one-to-one is what I like to do
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:12.420]  of compost and some people will say keep it one part of thermic and one part of
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:20.660]  vermi so you're going quarters not more than 25% of each of those that's gonna
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:27.900]  you any wider range of microbes because progression seer progression in microbes
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:33.980]  is a thing in the laboratory one of the things I study we would go out to the
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:38.660]  horse range and basically follow horse around until it took a shit and you pick
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:44.340]  up a little horse go pro and stick it in a Dixie cup and cover it immediately
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:48.380]  with a saran wrap and poke a hole in it and we go into the laboratory and we
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:55.420]  examined the serial progression for a six-week period putting a little bit of
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:05:00.540]  clean water in there and we had an electron microscope as well as we had
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:05.300]  we had some pretty cool stuff that we were using but we were identifying what
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.860]  was grown and how it progressed and which which ones required the other ones
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:15.220]  to grow first and in the set that's something that actually happens in in
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:19.300]  nature all over the place it's something that happens in our
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:24.740]  communities as well one thing comes in the next thing comes in you know we
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:30.820]  started out I started out growing with with Miracle-Gro and interestingly this
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:35.740]  past year I'd like you know I wonder and I went back and bought some to do some
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:43.020]  side-by-sides and it's terrible I'm sorry it grew great it tasted terrible
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:49.900]  yeah the next thing was Pete's and you know by it took me six seven years to
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:58.620]  become organic and really see the light and but it took me 20 years 30 years and
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:05.420]  I'm still learning I'm still learning yeah so taking taking that half organic
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:12.820]  matter in there and then balancing up and feeding it with these these things
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:17.620]  that got the foods in it besides besides the organic matter that breaks
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:20.380]  in but that's where everything's gonna come from the feed your plant right
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:26.460]  there is your is your compost so what you feed your compost that's what's
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:29.820]  gonna feed your plant you know you feed your soil and you feed your soil compost
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:36.220]  you feed your soil I use oh here's another one that I put in this is gypsum
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:42.940]  this is soluble gypsum all right so that's it's sulfur and calcium basically
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:57.940]  and sulfur is good stuff microbes pretty basic I can grab that here I can cool
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:09.620]  so actually all this talk got me to thinking so this is not sauerkraut that's
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:14.340]  right here so so EM1 right everyone talks about the EM1 it's got it's got
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:22.380]  the the goods that makes your mineralization occur and it's got
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:31.460]  photosynthetic sandbacteria okay that's my next one I'm gonna look after it's
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:38.380]  got yeasts in it the produced the produced esters and whatnot but the
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:42.660]  yeast are part of the breaking down process and in the soil they're floating
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:45.380]  around everywhere we can all make sourdough right and that's one of my
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:48.020]  next experiments is gonna be playing with the sourdough see what I can do
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:56.140]  with that I do feed my discards into my compost into my worm bins I have
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:03.060]  there's probably a dozen cultures in the cupboard behind me but but the science
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:08.900]  says like if the stuff's already there that EM1 is no different than the way
[01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:15.620]  off your yogurt right or if we're building labs okay so I started realizing
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:19.780]  I need to start teaching about labs again and how we can do our basic
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:25.300]  microbial dominance in our in our soil and faculty of anaerobes but but
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:32.100]  sauerkraut that's amazing right add salt to your cabbage and put it in the water
[01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:37.980]  and it goes through phases and six weeks later you've got this incredibly
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:47.100]  nutritious food that's preserved for 10 years whatever you can dehydrate it you
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:53.580]  can and it's still good for you still have the microbes just like the I have
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:58.220]  dry yeast starter pack sourdough from this amazing yeast capture I did last
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:03.020]  spring I've been making sourdoughs for over 20 years but the best ones I ever
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:11.900]  captured was last spring so what's going on here is when you make cab a sauerkraut
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:19.460]  you want to put in salt enough to make it alkali sufficient to get through the
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:23.140]  yeast fermentation process so there's there's a couple of different microbes
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:29.300]  the present on the plant and the very first thing is it takes place in the
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:38.820]  first 24 hours tends to be a yeast fermentation and when you seal your you
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:42.980]  know you use a weight or whatnot to put it down into the water and then you
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:50.580]  close the lid and that yeast creates co2 and creates an anaerobic situation that
[01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:55.300]  kills the yeast off all right so I've got a coffee filter on here and that
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:10:01.820]  oxygen and co2 flow happening and I'm observing the culturing of just those
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.540]  yeast and I'm going to start utilizing and and I'm doing this an experiment
[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:12.020]  because my mind thinks these things but but that's a one way I'm believing we
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:16.380]  can get that yeast element at home if you aren't so inclined to purchase one
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:20.460]  of these EM1 products which there's a lot of amazing ones and whether you're
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:25.740]  using the cashew is probably the grow cashews amazing stuff I might start
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:31.220]  making a be cash you actually just because why not but yeah so I started
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:34.700]  making my corned beef and cabbage last night and said you know I told that guy
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:37.460]  to leave the outside leaves on there but he peeled them off and handed me the
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:43.900]  cabinet and but I took the outers and lefters put them in here and I'm trying
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:50.440]  to get a little bit of yeast going but so once that yeast produced all these
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:55.580]  esters and their sulfur in there in the co2 and we've changed now the entire
[01:10:55.580 --> 01:11:01.180]  environment to some point we have that salt in there to keep it from going acid
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:06.940]  too soon because if we want the cabbage to stay a little bit crisp and if the
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:11.460]  bacteria the bacillus species of bacteria which there's four or five
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:16.940]  there's a couple of other they start kicking in but there if they kick in too
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:20.900]  early you're gonna you're gonna we don't put salt or soil doing so if we put that
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:25.300]  alcohol in there we can have that bacteria breaking things down right away
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:28.000]  and it don't matter we put this in our compost and we can talk to us with it
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.300]  but that's what we're gonna feed we can feed our soil with these things no one
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:45.940]  I'm gonna go back in time 25 years to some of my professors in forestry fire
[01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:52.540]  and the soils guys went out there there was different departments and these guys
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:59.580]  would work together head of agriculture was a forestry guy actually and
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:06.300]  brilliant man Wally mark with the good some of these other names I'm not
[01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:10.380]  pulling out right now but they we had some fire scar issues where bulldozers
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:16.020]  came through and scraped off all the top soil right so you've got this whether it
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:21.700]  was a gray wacky sandstone which is one that's got more dirt in it which is
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:27.180]  gonna have more nutrient if you've got to go use some native stone to you want
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:34.220]  one that's a great wacky over a white or a red oxicized sandstone but the best
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:37.220]  sandstone stuff is the layers we got in between the Reds and the Greens and the
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:42.340]  yellows the rarest anyhow the fellows were up on there's like a 20 years it
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:46.340]  was just eroding away at behind Cal Poly and they couldn't figure out how to get
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:52.300]  this stuff to grow they plant over they bring in some organic matter they put in
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:57.060]  jute matting they put in the nets and everything and nothing we would just
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:01.780]  when the rain came in March it washed away or the wind blew it away or it
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:06.100]  mineralized and just it was gone and you couldn't get anything to stick to this
[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:10.460]  whether it's decomposed granite or like great wacky there's a couple of those
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:16.100]  different there's a lot of serpentine right there too but the parent material
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:20.340]  without any organic matter it just doesn't grow and they started realizing
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:27.780]  like this stuff's dead soil it sterilizes just like if we were to burn
[01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:34.500]  it and in the same same concept came they started realizing these sterilized
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:40.260]  burn piles you could take and rake literally just take a rake and rake a
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:44.060]  little bit of the soil from right next to it onto the sterilized burn piles and
[01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:49.620]  the soils all black and all red and white because it's been devoid of
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:54.700]  microbes and just spreading blowing some dust over it basically from from the
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:59.020]  live soil next to it inoculated it and the same thing they figured out like if
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:03.020]  we dig up a couple of living plants and base them in there and we spread some
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:07.900]  of this we break over just take some buckets and spread the live understory
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:13.180]  than the the decomposed matter underneath the brush and we're having
[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:18.900]  burn the soil built up mineralized a good you know two three feet it's really
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:23.500]  interesting when the fire comes through there you have a monoculture of brush
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:28.380]  maybe five species but it burns and all of a sudden you've got 200 species of
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:35.220]  wildflowers bloom so they figured that it doesn't take a whole lot to inoculate
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:41.380]  these soils with what it takes for life to occur and you know that exposed
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:47.700]  mineralized soil had some leaching in it too but also these are wild plants
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:54.500]  adapted to growing in those conditions it doesn't take a whole lot but you want
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:58.060]  to maintain dominance and once it's there you're not going to do a whole lot
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:04.500]  to improve it this is a weird thing but that's what the science is saying that's
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:10.340]  what the the there's a study in Switzerland that ran a few years not too
[01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:13.940]  long ago and they found that that over a long period of time they did not show an
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:25.580]  increase in value from applying the EM1 except for if it was applied like as a
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:31.180]  substrate inoculant like a cache and they found that that actually was the
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:36.060]  the benefit was the cache inputs so I gave that some thought though it's like
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:42.260]  well how long that place been growing organically right if they've got
[01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:48.740]  everything going there already it's not going to be a problem or talking and
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:53.540]  improve anything right if they have a if they've got everything dialed in
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:57.740]  everything's in the system and it's operating you they'd have to totally
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:07.580]  sterilize a bed to actually have a test plot if you can follow that so I just
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:10.060]  mentioned something about about see you guys mentioned a couple things about
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:18.900]  Sears and Redwood Forest is a the monoculture old-growth Redwood Forest
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:25.460]  there you might have some some Creek dogwood in the low zones and there might
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:30.060]  be a couple of forbs and herbs in an actual Creek but you walk them through
[01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:33.220]  until you get up to the ridge where there ain't no trees growing it's just
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:38.340]  shrub brush it's a monoculture you can't grow a
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:41.820]  canvas plant down in the bottom of all that there's not a flight like
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:46.820]  intolerance but that's the way if you dig it up and haul it out and you got
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:54.860]  that that organic matter that can be 20 feet deep piled up when in 1907 the
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:58.480]  earthquakes in San Francisco burn and they had to go through and rebuild San
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:03.320]  Francisco and they pretty much clear-cut California from middle of Big Sur
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:11.760]  north all the redwood out of there they had to burn the debris three and four
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:19.040]  times and to get down to where it's just stumps and mineral soil again to where
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:24.320]  and that was branches of course but the branches burned out the first and second
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:31.280]  and all that stuff stumps come washing out of those creeks and stuff it's
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.360]  pretty amazing if you ever get the opportunity to go walk through some of
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:44.260]  those creeks and Big Sur I kind of it's been a while yeah so we got the perfect
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:51.640]  soil structure of them soil is medium and then we're adding these fine mineral
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:18:00.200]  to provide what mineral weathering can provide for us but the majority of
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:05.400]  everything is coming literally from our organic matter so we want the best
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:10.680]  quality compost and if you've got that structure built whether it's the clay or
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:18.560]  not I'm sorry not a clay what you're using pumice or if you're using rice
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:23.720]  holes or whatever and you got that proper balance to start with these
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:30.280]  problems shouldn't arise if you're watering properly your stuff's not going
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:34.960]  to dry out if you're using the right pot for your environment your soil is not
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:41.720]  going to dry out if your water regime is proper you're not gonna drive you can
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:48.700]  mimic nature in that o horizon because that's what we've lifted out we've
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:54.640]  lifted the horizon out of nature and put it into a pot or a bed or a bin by
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:19:01.960]  taking a probe in injecting air you can if you anticipate this kind of thing
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:13.400]  happening you can put the equivalent of a drip line with air hoses buried in and
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:19.840]  oxygenate the base there's and that can be a solar pump right there's ways we
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:27.760]  can do that without but the fact is that volume of container is all you have to
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.280]  work with and so when we're placing things in there that aren't going to
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:41.000]  benefit the process in a three or six month period we're detracting from our
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:48.800]  overall capacities produce so maximum yield comes from solving that equation
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:53.360]  and again that can vary it all you want to do is put a land-raise seed in the
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:20:02.080]  ground and walk away from it the system I saw in the horizontal system
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:08.880]  presentation would be perfect but but there is definitely flaws and even in I
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:12.920]  know Leighton I would get along great we would put together and eat mushrooms and
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:16.680]  go walking on the beach and have amazing conversations and I don't mean to be
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:19.480]  tearing it down but I'm gonna point out some things that I saw as major flaws
[01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:25.000]  and even acknowledge some of it for instance the fine-grained sand do not
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.160]  use any fine-grained sand all right that's that's not gonna do anything for
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:36.600]  you unless it's a shell it's that's that's gonna be a problem as you saw as
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:42.600]  he traveled it that created a actually a water pool right he created a Kalish in
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:48.240]  my mind what I saw happen there was was that sand layer and then topping it with
[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:58.160]  clay the is going to expand and fill all those pores that that just is your
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:01.600]  fungus isn't going to grow through that it's going to create a greater than 200
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:10.680]  psi plate hardpan the next layer above that all mineralized and proper soil
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:17.960]  dogma e horizon is eluviated or leached it's all washed clean of and it's a it
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:26.840]  actually clean of clay it tends to be a sand layer beneath the horizon but all
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:37.120]  that space in there is clay is is an essential thing for CC for a cat on
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:45.560]  exchange sites right that's that's where all of the available ions sit and all
[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:49.200]  the good stuff that plants can eat they're gonna sit right there on that
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:54.040]  clay so you need to play but but it doesn't have to be you want to know
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:56.800]  which clay you're using and we want to optimize and so that's why we have
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:04.660]  vermiculite is a something we use or pay attention and know what your clay is by
[01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:10.040]  color and structure and stuff and I use this dry stuff that we use for sealing
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:15.560]  actually so so I'm so sandy here I'm just started doing this a couple years
[01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:21.800]  ago where we're all taking a flower sifter and winter and spring and I flower
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:28.280]  sift over my yard adding especially where I'm growing food to increase my
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:37.480]  clay content water holding capacity in addition to the organic matter as I'm
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:40.440]  getting older my back just doesn't like me doing the work and I don't have a
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:44.720]  truck anymore it's harder for me to bring loads of manure and etc into the
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:53.800]  yard so there's ways of solving the equation we can trench in we can lay in
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:59.720]  these lava rocks with aeration or just better mix soil into the base there
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:08.560]  right and have that for a while if we're using a living soil properly even
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:15.560]  in a dry earth bag you should have a good cover crop and that's part of the
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:21.180]  situation that's going to stop that hydrophobicity occurring on your upper
[01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:26.520]  layer a mulch of any sort wood chip is like I said I don't mind a wood chip
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:30.840]  no different than straw right actually in the straw is going to would
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:36.880]  technically rob nitrogen faster because it has greater surface area so there's
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:41.160]  straws clean but if that stuff's properly mulched you're not gonna be
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:46.920]  drying out right you literally here it's so obvious my sand it literally sucks air
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:53.120]  out water up into the air as fast as it evaporates it leaches down in it's
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:57.400]  pretty amazing but it seems you cover it over and hold the water for days and
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:01.360]  that's Jeremy Silva said if you ain't if you ain't mulching you're missing the
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:10.840]  boat that's a key a key factor the cover crops tend to be air basis they're not
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:15.520]  necessarily going to be tapping in and driving chemistry equations in the soil
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:25.400]  for mining rock or sand they might interact with the that my charisma knows
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:29.000]  we know we want we want to have that fungi in there but it doesn't the plants
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.640]  aren't around long enough unless you put in an air basis plant in there that's
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:38.480]  going to be annual and coming back and having a long-term relationship with
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:46.800]  that my charisma my charisma does it occur in forest when I was in forestry
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:50.360]  schools like we know it's there we're not a hundred percent sure what's going
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:55.480]  on and they were really just started to figure this out 30 years ago the time
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:25:00.760]  frames required for a canvas plant and my charisma you know we're seeing
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.360]  evidence that it's like okay things are going on in the soil it benefit and when
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:09.240]  it is there but you know if the evidence also shows that if we inoculate
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:13.160]  stuff at seed planting or Germany as soon as there are root wads showing on
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:20.320]  our on our clones that that transfers along for several months and expands out
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:26.040]  with a root wad into the soil right so if you're using those just having them
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:29.080]  in the soil might not necessarily be the right thing because you've actually got
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:36.920]  to have that root tip exit a there for it to activate you know if you did want
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:40.560]  to use that system and you wanted to have something that's going to activate
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:47.000]  in a in that deep zone that's going to work well with those harder heavier
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.760]  soils that are going to exceed that 200 psi or generally a clay is going to be
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:56.440]  pretty hard for fungus to move through there's no air then it's just too heavy
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:01.920]  but but if you were to use for instance um persolane and this is something I
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:05.480]  don't see enough of people talking about persolane is a cover crop it's a low
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:10.720]  it's a low grower it's it's right on the surface and it's an amazing green mulch
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:18.240]  but it also it's it's like ultimate micronutrient absorber all right and
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:22.040]  cycler and grab myself out of the deep so that's something if you if you've got
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:25.720]  one thing to set up you went ahead and built that system and you're hearing me
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:29.160]  talk on scratching your head like well I've got a solution for that actually
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:37.600]  there are ways nature works it does those two things but it's definitely
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:42.040]  there's there's lots of ways of doing it we all again are going to have different
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:51.760]  access to different inputs and these are definitely a big question one thing that
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.960]  was really excited when I saw Layton's presentation was I really wanted to see
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:00.160]  what people come up with and pushing that potato around it's one of my my art
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:04.040]  masters would say that's a great idea let's push the potato around and see
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:07.280]  where it goes it's just people started asking me some questions and the more I
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:11.880]  thought about it I had to start making these posts explaining exactly what is
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:18.320]  going on on what scale time and space so we can have a better understanding of
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:30.640]  building a micro old-growth forest tree growing system is not exactly the same
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:38.760]  thing as growing a building a system of old-growth soil seer progressive you
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:48.040]  know community for our herbs to grow into I don't for the most part putting
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.760]  20% of rocks at the bottom of your containers removing 20% of your growing
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:58.600]  capacity in my mind in my experience until I get into some of like I saying
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:06.640]  like my gimmick systems with I hope to start teaching it's necessary when your
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:13.040]  bottom feeding and absorbing up I end up getting anaerobic pockets for sure if
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:20.560]  I do not have a base layer of drainage stuff those fines do accumulate and the
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:26.960]  wicking system the way the way that all ends up happening in the heart of pots
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:34.840]  regardless of their size or shape the center of it becomes anaerobic so so we
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.560]  actually we want some anaerobic space in our soil don't we we want that redox
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:46.120]  happening we know that that is part of what makes things happen and and I
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.880]  jumped over this earlier I was saying it's like it took me a while to really
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:53.880]  understand what was happening with the probiotic stuff and it was a discussion
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:29:00.560]  with Jeff chaser from soil builders back east he we were getting into discussing
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:05.200]  how the earth box worked and whether we want to let it dry out or not and most
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:08.800]  people say we don't want to let it dry out we want to keep that moist situation
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:15.560]  and and I started talking about point area source water influx in the
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:19.880]  landscape and in you know if you ever walk along a creek bed it's like
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:26.280]  depending on the time of year and how soon it is next to a storm there's
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:31.480]  different amounts of moisture and and so that the variable the variable point
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:38.400]  source area influx of water comes in things are go from mollusk to aerated
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.240]  right things go you get next to the creek where there's lots of water all
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:44.840]  the time you got that stinky soil and and sometimes maybe 20 feet away from
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:49.160]  there you might have stinky soil there's more water because there's more rain but
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:53.320]  when it dries out in the summer that stinky area reduces that's redox
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:30:01.480]  happening in nature okay you have saturation it rains you have the
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:05.640]  absorption until you have saturation and then you have overland flow and once you
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:09.320]  have overland flow you're not getting oxygen you're getting anaerobic
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:14.160]  situations in your soil and you have redox occur you have a swamp you have
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:19.920]  re you have reduction occurring and if that water gets churned you have
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:25.680]  oxidation occurring so we want redox occurring because that's how these
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:29.440]  mineral the weathering occurs and there's also part of the mineralization
[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:38.400]  that certain microbes require that anaerobic state actually
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:45.440]  apiconus residue backer for the big one with the peas of legumes used to absorb
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:51.480]  nitrogen out of the air it requires that nodule creates an anaerobic space but if
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:56.560]  you don't got peas you can manipulate that putting it in your soil and allowing
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:00.880]  an anaerobic space to occur and then but you still need to like put bean water on
[01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:04.600]  it to stimulate with the enzymes to make it think that there's a legume and
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:11.400]  presence but that's a people use biochar and some people you're gonna have a wide
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:15.040]  scale of the same thing is like you know it did wonders for me it didn't do
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.800]  nothing well your soil was already awesome if it didn't do nothing and or
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:22.720]  you might have had the wrong kind of biochar you know biochar has to heat up
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:27.320]  to certain certain temperatures for the lignans in the wood to technically melt
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:33.240]  they pyrolysis they turn to a liquid in a gas but if they're in a closed chamber
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:37.240]  without oxygen feeding them they can't oxidize at high temperature rapid
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:44.320]  oxidation and high temperature is fire right slow oxidation is thermic compost
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:52.920]  and and so when we control pyrolysis in a non oxidizing situation we get biochar
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:57.360]  and depending on what kind of wood you started with you've got a different
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:02.520]  structure at the end that literally plasticizes and creates these poor
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:07.080]  spaces all right so old hydroton does the same thing lava lava rock will do
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:12.400]  the same thing it creates those pore spaces and so when you saturate those
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:19.320]  pore spaces become anaerobic when they dry out they become oxidized and you
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:25.160]  have oxygen you have a redox equations occurring in those micro spaces okay so
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:32.560]  so you know you want to build some larger aggregate yes wood wood has these
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:38.960]  structures in them even before you have created it to biochar okay and
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:43.800]  depending on the type of wood right the hardwoods going to be having having more
[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:52.880]  pore space available than then pine right and finds more acidic and your
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:57.840]  the entire cell structure of the pine tree is different from a hardwood where
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:03.480]  hardwood can pass laterally as well as horizontally pine tree can only move
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:11.880]  horizontally for the most part okay you've got pine tree wood doesn't move
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:15.480]  well neither here nor there I'm just telling you those things are completely
[01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:23.200]  different you know if you've got access to for instance wood chips from a
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:31.080]  leguminous tree sorry I'm spacing on the name of the trees right now but but
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:34.560]  there's a leguminous trees that'll actually you can run through a chipper
[01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:43.520]  and have hot wood chips just in a pile without any greens in it whatsoever and
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:49.520]  locust I'm sorry so you got honey locust you got black locust so the different
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:52.880]  kinds of chips and stuff are going to do that but but we have a whole lot of
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.560]  different situations here but we want to stick towards mineralization over
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:34:04.120]  weathering is our source of inputs for our plants and we want to look to things
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:10.560]  that are actually occurring in the old horizon to maintain air and and so we
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:19.160]  can mimic mice digging holes by ramming a rod through it we can in plunging an
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:23.440]  air compressor rod right and blow some air in there that's a common thing in
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.240]  compost piles they are just a little too big for some of the turn is you pump a
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:31.800]  pump air into it with a rod and there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:38.320]  and in our tents of beds do something similar you know we know increasing in
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:43.940]  our grow room space if we triple our co2 we double our growth rate what happens
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:49.500]  when we triple our oxygen to our roots um right well if we got enough space for
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:58.260]  for the fungus to do its thing what is it needs its oxygen also right and the
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:06.140]  roots need their oxygen and so we could increase the biological capacity
[01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:10.140]  increasing our aeration
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:18.380]  yeah there's a I'd love to help people out I you know again in the long run
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:21.780]  even if I'm not getting paid thousands of dollars to come out and tell you what
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:25.780]  to do or what I think should be done my daughter's gonna have a better place to
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:36.240]  live when it comes time for you have her kids so we we had a cameo for a second
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:40.440]  and I think he'll be back but that was spot check news who was in the chat who
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:47.640]  is gonna give us a quick tour and update on his California garden which the joy
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:53.760]  of living in California is the gardens go year-round oh yeah I'm loving that in
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:36:02.520]  your in your ladybug release party there we're just barely the 12-year not even
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:07.560]  I've got I do the thing we're all flipping door move into the greenhouse
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:11.840]  for the 12s and the penny it's part of my stress testing my understanding my
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:15.600]  genetics at different times of the year different genetics will respond
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:22.000]  differently to doing that and the currently normally my greenhouse is full
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  of stuff that's about the same range as yours and I'm not this year like oh so
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.280]  jealous out in the open like that it's yeah if you're not growing spring 12s do
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:43.000]  it start doing it figure it out even you know wherever you're at it can be done I
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:51.120]  started using a tarp myself little bit about the mid April so I just
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:57.480]  transplanted a bunch of the blue corn you sent me from the little pots into
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:06.710]  the raised beds and then actually hold on one second I gotta get your pictures
[01:37:06.710 --> 01:37:11.110]  of that stuff it I think there's definitely some of my Instagram what's
[01:37:11.110 --> 01:37:15.510]  that there's definitely some of that blue corn shown ripe on my Instagram I'm
[01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:19.710]  pretty sure yeah I'll try to pull it up in a second but can you tell us so this
[01:37:19.710 --> 01:37:26.070]  is a breath of red dragon right breath of red dragon number 13 is when my
[01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:31.990]  breeder cuts that I'm trying to get out to the world and people can you know
[01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:37.190]  there's one of things Kevin Geordi is said to me is man you're an artist but
[01:37:37.190 --> 01:37:42.030]  how do you market yourself well and this was a few months good things things are
[01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:45.870]  changing dramatically for me in the last few months actually on all sorts of
[01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:57.270]  levels and but yeah the the red dragon big sativa with some og back in see if
[01:37:57.270 --> 01:38:03.590]  it compares you know I know it does for me I know it does for my friends one of
[01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:06.630]  the things people ask it like you've never been a dispensary how do you know
[01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:10.030]  because everyone who goes to dispensaries comes back and says man
[01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:15.830]  that's a fact I definitely I got some GMO cookies right now I'm loving it I
[01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:21.590]  grew it and it was growing it I wasn't so stoked but is it is it's curing out
[01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:26.630]  and aging there's definitely it's nice to try other people's stuff and there's
[01:38:26.630 --> 01:38:34.510]  Perry brought me something where to go I had it right here no I don't know what
[01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:41.630]  happened I guess I took it downstairs I got something a fresh antigenics I think
[01:38:41.630 --> 01:38:48.310]  just drop some stuff and it's the whoa and it's a they're they're rainbows
[01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:52.550]  something stud and something mint and it's like you know I'm getting all these
[01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:58.310]  mint varieties coming out I'd be nice to compare that that's spoken on today it's
[01:38:58.310 --> 01:39:04.190]  a chocolate mint and it's like and I'd love for everyone to get this I
[01:39:04.190 --> 01:39:09.670]  don't know if I can transfer this in seed so the same as this number 13
[01:39:09.670 --> 01:39:14.150]  breath of red dragon it's like this thing's fucking awesome let's put it out
[01:39:14.150 --> 01:39:19.390]  there let's let some clones run around and see what happens and you know it
[01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:25.070]  it's questionable for when a breeder is like sends a clone out do I benefit by
[01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:30.390]  doing this no one's gonna grow by my seed if they got the clone but on the
[01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:37.670]  other hand this is just like my f1 breeder so wait wait you see what I do
[01:39:37.670 --> 01:39:45.070]  and I think I'll contend with anything for people who grow sativa there's a
[01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:52.550]  few of those out there I'd like folks to share that out and I'd like I'll be
[01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:57.430]  sending a couple of more people in different places but that is a Nigerian
[01:39:57.430 --> 01:40:09.790]  Yoruba Bantu crossed into my dr. dream all cure and this just showed up so it
[01:40:09.790 --> 01:40:16.390]  was in a it was in a box for three days yeah I haven't gotten one of brother
[01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:20.390]  bones beautiful new clone shippers yeah those are awesome I'm definitely gonna
[01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:24.870]  be picking some of those up here someone just bought four of those and so I
[01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:30.030]  they're packed up in a box right now so after this I'm gonna hit the post office
[01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:36.470]  excellent thanks no one picked up some of your stuff and I oh so just quickly
[01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:44.710]  next week we're coming on with Indian land race exchange and I assume we're
[01:40:44.710 --> 01:40:51.430]  talking land race yeah the general topic yeah you know Syrian used to talk quite
[01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:58.150]  a bit and when I ran the land race traders club on Facebook it was a
[01:40:58.150 --> 01:41:02.590]  pretty small group of about a thousand people the micro influencing but
[01:41:02.590 --> 01:41:07.350]  thousand people who are really interested in land race that luckily I
[01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:14.630]  met him there and we struck it up pretty good it did some interaction and you
[01:41:14.630 --> 01:41:19.990]  know he was doing his thing before we met but holy cow he's really doing it
[01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:26.470]  now and making a difference in the world and preservation and stuff and
[01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:30.990]  yeah I love quoting Kev because he's always got gems but but one of them is
[01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:34.630]  he was talking to some folks across the pond the other day with talking shit with
[01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:39.150]  Eagle and and he said something about like we never know who or where we're
[01:41:39.150 --> 01:41:43.830]  influencing when we do stuff and and you know I know I've taken some of the
[01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:48.670]  communication and I get harsh done for my spelling and stuff I can't spell I'm
[01:41:48.670 --> 01:41:52.910]  so dyslexic and then I'm typing on a teeny little phone usually and I get
[01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:58.270]  ripped on in in Facebook and stuff quite a bit and it would take me down places
[01:41:58.270 --> 01:42:02.470]  and rarely would anybody ever come out and like send me a little note and
[01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:06.030]  saying hey man keep teaching because there's all these people who aren't
[01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:13.870]  ripping on you or learning and it would really really resonate with me I keep on
[01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:19.830]  keep on but one of the things that that when I first found future cannabis
[01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:24.790]  project and hearing people talking about land race and and I'm hearing words I'm
[01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:30.990]  like that sounds familiar and I'm hearing the way they're talking I'm like
[01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:35.990]  and he says I was influenced by his arian and it's like oh well that makes
[01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:41.790]  sense because is there any tells me he used to like translate my writings to
[01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:49.270]  teach his crew and they so it all comes around pretty a full circle and stuff
[01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:53.590]  and while I'm not intensively working with raw land race like I was and I have
[01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:57.110]  a huge cache of it and I'd like to get back to preserving and and breathing
[01:42:57.110 --> 01:43:01.310]  there's only so much we could do he's taking that mantle on a run with it it's
[01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:08.470]  freaking awesome and developing proper terminology to describe you know I talk
[01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:12.070]  about where I'm taking my plants from indoor flip and put them outside at
[01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:16.830]  different times of the year to see how they respond and part of that is trying
[01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:23.310]  to figure out what the dominance is in its base origin genetic were developed
[01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:30.230]  on the earth's plane and elevation and longitude whether it was tropical
[01:43:30.230 --> 01:43:33.630]  whether you know how it responds to the the wavelength of light that it's
[01:43:33.630 --> 01:43:38.550]  getting and the duration of life that it's getting and these things tell me a
[01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:43.670]  lot with how fast something might revert to veg for instance or continue to keep
[01:43:43.670 --> 01:43:49.550]  but but so something he's derived is this amazing way of breaking down land
[01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:54.270]  race because so some people who deal with land race like I do who like I go
[01:43:54.270 --> 01:43:58.950]  out and collect wild seeds of grasses for instance right I've got a bunch of
[01:43:58.950 --> 01:44:08.630]  wild grasses growing in my yard long it works a lot better on my lawn then the
[01:44:08.630 --> 01:44:14.110]  the blue fescue or whatever it is that they've bred for purific lawns with a
[01:44:14.110 --> 01:44:20.750]  clay slot because I have an alkali sand so so there's different I like land
[01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:26.030]  race on a whole different but I collect wild flowers and stuff too and grow wild
[01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:35.150]  wildflowers and but why we do cannabis land race is important but how we talk
[01:44:35.150 --> 01:44:43.030]  about it and preservation and breeding when I say land race to me that
[01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:49.950]  encompasses like three or four different groupings for what is Arians done with
[01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:56.310]  his work working firsthand with these farmers and wild crops from around the
[01:44:56.310 --> 01:45:03.950]  the Middle Eastern and India regions and the Himalayas and such he's categorizing
[01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:13.150]  elevation and latitude and ways that goes beyond narrow leaf and wide leaf
[01:45:13.230 --> 01:45:20.590]  the some of us really care about most people will say a land race is something
[01:45:20.590 --> 01:45:26.750]  that was been just been has been worked by a farmer and everything else is wild
[01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:31.950]  and that doesn't really necessarily fit into describing what the progression
[01:45:31.950 --> 01:45:37.430]  from wild to these super hybrids that we have now that are in commercial
[01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:49.750]  so on your spectrum you'd have wild land race heirloom like what's your kind of
[01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:56.830]  the word land race when it gets used it is it becomes a generic term for me that
[01:45:56.830 --> 01:46:03.550]  goes everything from wild feral to regional heirloom and some people don't
[01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:07.470]  like the term heirlooms for me heirloom is a style of breeding that you just
[01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:11.950]  select the best looking plant every year right it has the traits that you
[01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:20.710]  personally desire okay and so that's how like in in Afghanistan like every
[01:46:20.710 --> 01:46:26.390]  village has got a different variant right so if there's a wild population
[01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:32.190]  near that to me I call that a garden variety okay where it's interacting with
[01:46:32.190 --> 01:46:37.270]  the wild population but if it's a if it's grown as a commercial crop in a
[01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:41.070]  region that becomes a regional heirloom and but you can't you can't have them in
[01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:44.750]  the specific seed production facility that's popping out seed like we do for
[01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:51.190]  our commercial grain crop for instance right you so for me I've got I've got
[01:46:51.190 --> 01:46:58.190]  land race to me land race means truly wild population and it could be a feral
[01:46:58.350 --> 01:47:04.750]  one that's been there for a long time it's adapted like an island endemic okay
[01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:10.670]  the next step is this garden variety which is near a wild population then you
[01:47:10.670 --> 01:47:16.590]  have the regional heirloom and and then from there you we've gotten our heirloom
[01:47:16.590 --> 01:47:21.550]  or we come into some of hey I to me it changes because what he's doing he's
[01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:25.790]  dealing with wild stuff around the world but for me it comes into breeding at
[01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:30.630]  that point and so we've got stuff where for instance I have taken wild plants
[01:47:30.630 --> 01:47:35.750]  that he's collected seed from and bred it out two or three generations and so
[01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:42.430]  you know that's a cultivated land race that becomes something we can offer as a
[01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:49.230]  breeding stock and that's what most people are thinking when they say a land
[01:47:49.230 --> 01:47:55.710]  race is what we have offered here is the New Mexico land or I'm sorry the the PCK
[01:47:55.710 --> 01:48:06.030]  or the Hindu Kush or the the Malawi right those ones have been selected they
[01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:10.310]  came from wild stock there was they were grown as regional heirlooms and garden
[01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:14.550]  varieties but eventually they were selected by a horticulturalist a
[01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:25.310]  preservationist and or a anthropologist and a selection was made and put into a
[01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:32.390]  gene pay a pool of cultivar and so that's where it gets kind of hairy is
[01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:35.790]  like is it still a land race or is it the cultivar and how much open
[01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:40.390]  pollination is done by the preservationist versus in breeding I've
[01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:46.390]  got a PCK a Pakistani Chitil Kush that was collected and I'm not exactly sure
[01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:52.030]  who Canada to be in our origins were but so someone bought a pack from then they
[01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:56.390]  inbred it for seven generations I acquired it I've been bred it now for
[01:48:56.390 --> 01:49:00.110]  four generations I've done it in two lines open pollination I like to keep
[01:49:00.110 --> 01:49:04.030]  calling that Pakistani Chitil Kush is land race but I've inbred one specific
[01:49:04.030 --> 01:49:07.750]  line selecting for a certain trait that's no longer a land race at all I
[01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:16.710]  can't qualify that at all that's now a inbred line of cultivar so but so what
[01:49:17.190 --> 01:49:22.790]  would I my ideal is a breeder is it is going to be a little bit different than
[01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:28.070]  what he's presenting is a preservationist and that type of thing
[01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:34.030]  and I love the way he's broken it down it definitely takes what I was
[01:49:34.030 --> 01:49:41.310]  presenting five six years ago that I got from discussing with my mentor and over
[01:49:41.310 --> 01:49:46.470]  just my passion for since I started growing was with land race originally
[01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:52.110]  and in the early 90s I could tell you what land race was in the weed that was
[01:49:52.110 --> 01:49:55.910]  smoking up until about 93 or 94 I could tell you what everything was poly
[01:49:55.910 --> 01:50:01.630]  hybrid it into it from the base origins because that's all we had in the mid 80
[01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:05.510]  beside besides the chronic in but even the chronic coming out of the triangle
[01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:12.110]  in the mid 80s was it might have been a single f1 hybrid right but by the time
[01:50:12.110 --> 01:50:18.430]  we got into mid 90s we've got poly poly hybrids going and I lost I lost I
[01:50:18.430 --> 01:50:24.430]  couldn't tell you what was in it that way you that on the screen right yeah
[01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:32.470]  let's see so I think my feet is way behind so I can just see it on my on my
[01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:35.910]  little phone so I can't even read it
[01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:40.790]  he's talking about classification of the various cannabis species types subtypes
[01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:44.590]  is perhaps one of the most important yet debated topics amongst various people
[01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:54.910]  and groups so that's kind of what we'll be talking about next week yeah no I
[01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:59.550]  talk about like that that tension that can form and discussing this stuff and
[01:50:59.550 --> 01:51:04.310]  yeah and when you search for for a land-raise definition you find a whole
[01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:07.350]  bunch of definitions by people who have never ever worked with anything that
[01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:10.630]  would actually qualify as a land-raise in their breeding whether they're
[01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:16.270]  they're breeding food plants or ornamental plants or or whatnot but they
[01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:21.230]  have a doctorate degrees so they get that affirmation that okay that's what
[01:51:21.230 --> 01:51:26.310]  it is when you've got folks who are literally collecting them from the wild
[01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:31.110]  and such and you know an interesting one for instance I make the claim that
[01:51:31.110 --> 01:51:35.430]  I have one of the only true North American land races of THC bearing
[01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:41.950]  cannabis it's not an escaped hemp plant and people like oh how the where do you
[01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:47.850]  and at what point does a feral plant that's escaped cultivation and gone
[01:51:47.850 --> 01:51:57.610]  wild adapt to its now endemic position and become an island endemic in a new
[01:51:57.610 --> 01:52:05.370]  native at what point does it become this is stuff I I did my my senior project
[01:52:05.370 --> 01:52:09.850]  science field science in Carrizo Plains in California studying the native
[01:52:09.850 --> 01:52:14.650]  that's considered to be one of the best examples of a native grassland in
[01:52:14.650 --> 01:52:22.370]  California left but it's all it's all old plow land literally and so I'm out
[01:52:22.370 --> 01:52:30.490]  there counting and identifying various plants and desert sands that hardly have
[01:52:30.490 --> 01:52:34.930]  grown and don't actually morphize to what they're supposed to look like it
[01:52:34.930 --> 01:52:38.810]  was an interesting deal but but I was comparing I found like there would been
[01:52:38.930 --> 01:52:44.810]  five fires over a 15-year period and I went through and and did transects biome
[01:52:44.810 --> 01:52:49.650]  transects what was growing inside and outside of those burned areas and
[01:52:49.650 --> 01:52:54.570]  compared that showing fire actually increases native plant species dominance
[01:52:54.570 --> 01:53:02.970]  over the in base new endemics okay so we know that these introduced and wild
[01:53:02.970 --> 01:53:07.170]  species have become endemic they're not going away there there but they're not
[01:53:07.170 --> 01:53:13.050]  they didn't evolve in that spot we know cannabis is highly involved evolving
[01:53:13.050 --> 01:53:19.330]  it's constantly evolving like Kevin Jordan I have both been on this
[01:53:19.330 --> 01:53:26.090]  intensive hunt for skunks and we both seem to find different similar responses
[01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:31.010]  from what used to be called skunk and growing today and finding something
[01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:33.850]  that's actually skunk and that's one of things with that 13 is it's got some
[01:53:33.850 --> 01:53:39.410]  heavy skunk to it and I'm interested to find out if that comes through around
[01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:43.610]  the country in different places but things are changing change the only
[01:53:43.610 --> 01:53:51.330]  constant in the universe but yeah so what point has it evolved from its
[01:53:51.330 --> 01:53:55.970]  origins and whether it was the ancient high plateaus of the Chinese Himalaya
[01:53:55.970 --> 01:54:02.810]  deserts or if it was an Indicus region and all things spread from from somewhere
[01:54:02.810 --> 01:54:08.890]  in those points we think at what point does it become native to that location
[01:54:08.890 --> 01:54:14.330]  you know things were mostly were spread by animals and man and how how did it
[01:54:14.330 --> 01:54:20.330]  adapt how did they change at what point does it become local to there and a land
[01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:27.770]  race that was endemic and yeah like with mine in New Mexico the Spaniards were
[01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:33.250]  there and in the late 1500s right it's not the mid 1500s and they brought their
[01:54:33.250 --> 01:54:38.490]  plants with them for medicine and rope and back then it wasn't necessarily
[01:54:38.490 --> 01:54:43.170]  separated between medicine and rope and quite often you wanted the same thing
[01:54:43.170 --> 01:54:49.290]  that the brown robes of the priests wore was made from hemp and the same people
[01:54:49.290 --> 01:54:53.450]  have owned that piece of property since 1700 it was granted to them by the king
[01:54:53.450 --> 01:54:59.050]  of Spain and the grandfather says hey that's us been there all along then they
[01:54:59.050 --> 01:55:02.930]  is looking at things and conjecturing it's like yeah I could have been there
[01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:07.930]  since 1600 earlier you're on wild at which point is it a native to that
[01:55:07.930 --> 01:55:15.210]  totally evolved there but we definitely call that a land race whether it's still
[01:55:15.210 --> 01:55:22.810]  you know I've got a hand of man on it or not it's he what what what land race
[01:55:22.810 --> 01:55:26.610]  where the word come from you know that's an important thing and how they
[01:55:26.610 --> 01:55:33.530]  get changed over time that's all part of the discussion too well tell me if you
[01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:37.850]  agree with this comment from what he stems cannabis is not constantly
[01:55:37.850 --> 01:55:42.130]  evolving it's adapting the expression of the genes changes not the genes
[01:55:42.130 --> 01:55:54.530]  themselves yeah totally it's the same species I agree with that but it's so
[01:55:54.530 --> 01:55:58.890]  yeah I think I think that's a better term adapting but we also think about
[01:55:58.890 --> 01:56:05.410]  this when we look at one of the genome projects they're able to differentiate
[01:56:05.410 --> 01:56:09.770]  things that have been in a location for a thousand years by the genetic so there
[01:56:09.850 --> 01:56:20.570]  is something more than just a adaptive epigenetic expression it becomes
[01:56:20.570 --> 01:56:27.890]  selected towards that epigenetic expression right the granted is short
[01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:32.730]  study my friend was living st. Thomas and he said every every indica seed he
[01:56:32.730 --> 01:56:38.210]  ever tried to plant there grew out like what we call us a diva right and and you
[01:56:38.210 --> 01:56:40.970]  know I'm using these words genetically because they have a generically they
[01:56:40.970 --> 01:56:49.690]  have a lot of meanings depending on the context the definitely that's it's a
[01:56:49.690 --> 01:56:54.010]  complex question and somebody asked us to bring up whether there's actually
[01:56:54.010 --> 01:56:58.650]  three species or not right and it's like well I'm not a geneticist that's not
[01:56:58.650 --> 01:57:06.930]  actually my scope but yeah how do we define species they're finding that
[01:57:06.930 --> 01:57:14.770]  actually there is a genetic difference from ruder Alice to the Afganica versus
[01:57:14.770 --> 01:57:23.530]  the sativa and sativa technically means cultivated so you know the species name
[01:57:23.530 --> 01:57:32.490]  originally was cannabis cultivated identified by Linnaeus right that was a
[01:57:32.490 --> 01:57:38.010]  long time ago we had a lot less observation tools part of our
[01:57:38.010 --> 01:57:44.570]  understanding is evolving as well and yeah that's a great question and then
[01:57:44.570 --> 01:57:49.330]  how about this one the genes change every time a new seed is made millions
[01:57:49.330 --> 01:57:53.770]  of years ago cannabis diverge from hops as a distinct species due to genes
[01:57:53.850 --> 01:58:01.970]  changing yeah I put on my Carhartt's I put on my Levi's I put up no kidding um
[01:58:01.970 --> 01:58:08.490]  so the genes get rearranged they're not changing that's what when you when you
[01:58:08.490 --> 01:58:15.090]  have sexual reproduction there there's a different combination occurring a
[01:58:15.090 --> 01:58:20.970]  different capacity for adaptation and and then so the ones that are selected
[01:58:21.090 --> 01:58:25.970]  for right instead of those that are selected against after the change in
[01:58:25.970 --> 01:58:32.850]  capacity to to have an epigenetic expression that it's that new
[01:58:32.850 --> 01:58:39.750]  environment that's where we have a change in genes is the next generation
[01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:46.690]  that has success and the ability to reproduce that new set of the
[01:58:46.810 --> 01:58:55.370]  possibilities right you know you even even when we inbreed and hermaphrodite
[01:58:55.370 --> 01:59:01.770]  occurs or we intentionally cut ethylene out and we produce that gamete of a
[01:59:01.770 --> 01:59:06.610]  single plant you're you can have new combinations you're not creating a clone
[01:59:06.610 --> 01:59:12.270]  like when you literally cut and root a plant they can recombine and have new
[01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:15.930]  possibilities and those new possibilities can have a completely
[01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:21.570]  different epigenetic expression in the exact same environment that the parent
[01:59:21.570 --> 01:59:31.130]  that was self came from yeah the like like us in our parents were you know
[01:59:31.130 --> 01:59:34.770]  your parents they reproduced how many times in my family there was five kids
[01:59:34.770 --> 01:59:40.370]  and there are some of us we have similarities and and dissimilarities
[01:59:40.370 --> 01:59:45.770]  amongst us all and even some of us that look the same have things that look very
[01:59:45.770 --> 01:59:51.010]  different and we've all gone off and done very different things in life right
[01:59:51.010 --> 02:00:05.120]  and so do our children yeah another great point in question there so just
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:09.760]  quickly let me I'm gonna bring up your IG I mean we don't have to cover every
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:16.040]  topic in today's conversation I think we can break it up into multiple two hour
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:21.920]  long conversations but is there anything from your here hold on give me
[02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:36.440]  one second in three two okay so just sorry I'm I was looking for your your
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:40.960]  blue corn pictures and I couldn't find oh yeah not there in there they'd be
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:50.040]  back yeah so I think I posted me last year even so can you see the screen
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:54.480]  right now I can see the pictures and such yep yeah so just tell me when you
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:59.840]  want me to stop and if there's any post you want to just make a comment on
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:08.120]  guys here here you have like the chromatographic ion flow and soil more
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:14.240]  yeah that's a neat one let's let's touch on that for a second so then like
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:24.040]  one something like I heard to stay one time was questioning why who would you
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:27.560]  why would you use Epsom salts right and and that man that man's got a wealth of
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:33.960]  information and when he's teaching it's freaking amazing but there's also again
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:37.400]  we all have different perspectives and understandings and I think in that one
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:43.600]  I'm trying to point out that it might be another one I'm showing that this
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:51.440]  stuff actually exists in nature and it's it's a needed part of what's going on
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:57.280]  here but also the picture doesn't show it but it is the the words do that it
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:03.200]  moves through the water pretty darn fast and so does the calcium those do the
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:07.360]  magnesium moves through fast and the calcium is too fast those those of those
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:14.840]  things are things that be mined and there is a the big running joke about
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:19.680]  CalMag and in the industry in the culture right and where's that come from
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:26.200]  and moving from that that amazing three-part soil is soil I showed you and
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:31.960]  then everyone started going in the street like hydroton and rockwool right
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:38.320]  and you're like losing the capacity to hold there's no there's no more clay
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:44.080]  there's the victim of vermiculites gone right and rockwool that fibrous basalt
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:49.120]  isn't gonna hold anything right so things are just flushing right past and
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:53.520]  washing out and if you're going to run to waste and whatnot you had to add
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:03:00.500]  calcium and magnesium for your system to work okay and that was just part of the
[02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:04.060]  progression of how things went forward and like everybody needed especially the
[02:03:04.060 --> 02:03:07.260]  next thing that happened was we went into RO water people stopped using tap
[02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:10.180]  water and so like boom there was actually enough of that stuff in the
[02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:15.940]  tap water to run your two-part and in a completely soilless medium that had
[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:22.060]  nothing there but okay now we move in the soil and all of a sudden people
[02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:27.780]  don't know how the basic mineralization of organic matter works and I know when
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:32.100]  I started growing organic I had no freaking clue this is this is literally
[02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:38.020]  thousands of hours of searching and researching and reading and studying and
[02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:41.180]  seeing listening to people's movies and talking about and then we're all
[02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:49.260]  progressing forward and forward and forward right so it is a naturally that
[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:52.900]  stuff is all part of the naturally occurring ecosystems and depending on
[02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:57.860]  where you are and the landscape and stuff and so when we mine them and use
[02:03:57.860 --> 02:04:07.740]  them as mineral inputs yeah it's a salt not necessarily a bad one though so I'm
[02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:12.180]  trying to show all that stuff there and that one in particular is how and
[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:16.020]  something I don't have in there that I'd like to have that someone is some of the
[02:04:16.020 --> 02:04:21.220]  imagery of what a clay structure is with the crystalline structure of a clay and
[02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:26.140]  how this the cation exchange sites work on the clay when it's in balance and
[02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:32.220]  such and how the different layers set up and everything and and I should have
[02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:35.140]  drawn it in there it doesn't it talks about it the magnesium is not shown in
[02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:42.460]  that waterfall so but as we talk dress stuff right ion and ions and ions are
[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:47.180]  getting pushed through the system there and they become available they get pushed
[02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:51.780]  through the system one man at a charge is going to knock out the other one and
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:54.940]  they're going to bounce each other down through the column and basically that's
[02:04:54.940 --> 02:04:58.820]  what it's talking about is what happens when we top feed and what we when we
[02:04:58.820 --> 02:05:05.660]  water and what you know it's part of intensive agriculture again we're not
[02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:10.620]  growing trees in a forest it's not a 200 hundred years time scale we're
[02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:18.020]  intensively growing things and trying to mimic nature we're not copying nature
[02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:22.220]  perfectly you know as an oil painter if I go out in nature and I look at a
[02:05:22.220 --> 02:05:26.580]  landscape and I say that moves me dramatically I want to copy it to bring
[02:05:26.580 --> 02:05:31.180]  it into the house I'm never going to be able to draw every line there's no way
[02:05:31.180 --> 02:05:34.380]  to make every single connection I have to simplify it and get the bigger
[02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:41.340]  picture in place and you know and that and then we optimize it I might change
[02:05:41.340 --> 02:05:45.540]  the color and the oil painting to make it feel a little bit better to people's
[02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:51.580]  sensibilities in the soil we want to change what we might find in nature to
[02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:56.380]  make it a little more optimal to what our plants are going to perform right
[02:05:56.380 --> 02:06:00.300]  and again going back we're going to constantly have that that that thing
[02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:06.100]  called reality which is the space between idealism and survival what do we
[02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:15.260]  have access to right yeah you know take a look at that those images and I'm
[02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:19.580]  planning on doing more and more expansion on these concepts there on
[02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:26.340]  that IG and eventually here I don't have the tools for making proper videos but
[02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:30.940]  I'd like to start well you you can basically film with your phone and just
[02:06:30.940 --> 02:06:34.580]  send them to me like in our shared folder and then I can piece them together
[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:41.700]  sure sure no we can do that we can do it and I'm there's a I'm looking at doing
[02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:46.340]  like little mini series also for that I could monetize myself and like how-to
[02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:50.060]  classes and stuff like that I'm looking at a bigger picture for my myself as
[02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:53.980]  well as others how do I teach this stuff without one of my hardest things is
[02:06:53.980 --> 02:06:57.860]  people send me a PM asking me a question about something on a post and
[02:06:57.860 --> 02:07:00.740]  it's like well you know in the future just ask me on the post so I don't have
[02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:03.660]  to answer this question once and everyone gets to see the answer right
[02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:08.180]  right and but then you know the other thing is it's like I've been handed out
[02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:11.300]  what people charge thousands and thousands of dollars to consult for free
[02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:14.820]  for years right it'd be nice for me to get a few pennies every time someone
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:19.980]  watches the video and again I'm happy to do these in multiple places so we have
[02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:24.980]  more exposure some more people and whether we're linking them in with you
[02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:29.100]  etc my own you I have a YouTube channel that doesn't really have anything of the
[02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:33.700]  sort nothing's edited just a bunch of nature clips and ski clips and stuff
[02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:39.540]  it'd be nice to be able to start teaching more effectively well just
[02:07:39.540 --> 02:07:46.460]  quickly one way people can support you is well we'll talk about this later
[02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:50.780]  because I wanted to do the soil talk but at some you added a bunch of new
[02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:56.540]  lines to the website and we go through these maybe next week yeah but real
[02:07:56.540 --> 02:07:59.780]  quick I'd like to state that you know people look at it on the surface that
[02:07:59.780 --> 02:08:03.660]  looks like a real expensive price tag on all my gear most of the stuff is
[02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:08.020]  extremely exclusive those top line some of those that's all there is of those
[02:08:08.020 --> 02:08:12.940]  seeds and then there won't be any more ever made literally those were offered
[02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:16.700]  up at an auction a couple of years back the auction for the beard and people
[02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:19.820]  who have heard me talk and understand where I'm at what I'm doing I didn't get
[02:08:19.820 --> 02:08:23.700]  a penny of it but 15 seeds the first time I ever offered to the public went
[02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:28.660]  for $2,000 in an auction right the $200 to access the same stuff and the third
[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:34.500]  13 seeds per pack and we should be getting a pack of the hardcore out with
[02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:39.340]  every purchase is one of my standards so you're actually getting two packs the
[02:08:39.340 --> 02:08:46.300]  hardcore has 20 seeds or more in the pack and yeah so you and then on top of
[02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:51.660]  that you're supporting future cannabis project you're supporting my efforts and
[02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:56.260]  so much of what I'm doing with these seeds actually is supporting compassion
[02:08:56.260 --> 02:09:01.380]  care for like cancer patients who have no access and gratefully here so far
[02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:06.540]  I've actually not a cancer patient but I've since last talk I've got be able to
[02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:10.820]  help somebody out I'm gonna change his life and he's gonna pay it forward and
[02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:14.900]  change other people's lives and that's that's the that's partly how I'm able to
[02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:19.740]  do this where I do this is the fact that this is truly my First Amendment right
[02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:27.460]  to my spiritual reality make the world a better place for all of us
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:34.820]  someone yes those orders are all packed up right over there and as soon as we
[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:42.100]  finish um the Prius is heading to the post office right there's some there's a
[02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:51.820]  box of bone clones going out and lots of seed packs yes my little my little
[02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:59.580]  fingers are getting limber or they've been limber so yeah no what we'll do
[02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:06.620]  yeah a bunch of so next week we're gonna be on with Indian land race exchange I'm
[02:10:06.660 --> 02:10:12.780]  just trying to think of some housekeeping stuff tonight doc rays
[02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:20.100]  coming on but we're gonna do it on Clubhouse and broadcast it to YouTube so
[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:25.660]  anyone who's on Clubhouse come jump in the or I don't know if you can search
[02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:32.700]  for clubs but it's just future cannabis project yes we do ship to Canada there
[02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:39.620]  are some orders going there today but what I like about Clubhouse is people
[02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:43.700]  like for example here people on the chat if I could just pull them up onto the
[02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:48.740]  stage but I can't I'd have to like send someone an email with the link to join
[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:56.620]  the conversation whereas Clubhouse just it's much more nimble so anyway what's
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:10:59.100]  that I need to dial it in I'm enjoying your
[02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:04.540]  conversations you've been bought are you on an Android or an iPhone I'm an
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:09.100]  Android right now okay yeah cuz unfortunately Clubhouse is only iPhone
[02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:15.420]  but my assumption is imminently it'll be Android as well but so part of the
[02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:20.140]  reason I started doing this was because there are so many people who can't be on
[02:11:20.140 --> 02:11:25.700]  Clubhouse it's kind of like a velvet rope so I was like well what if we grab
[02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:29.300]  some of these conversations from Clubhouse just made them available
[02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:35.620]  freely to everybody the shout out to all your fans the other day was at the glass
[02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:41.540]  show that didn't come up oh yeah so that was an example so I was not I was up in
[02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:47.860]  Santa Barbara when we did that one but I recorded it and I just posted that video
[02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:53.460]  last night right so there was a hundred of us sitting there for an hour waiting
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:59.580]  for it to come live that's how awesome your fans are I didn't realize it didn't
[02:11:59.580 --> 02:12:06.980]  cancel the oops it was interesting we all thought it was just the daylight
[02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:10.700]  savings now food by an hour and then it finally disappeared after about an hour
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:18.220]  20 yeah so so yeah no sorry about that it uh the light yeah anyway but uh so
[02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:24.100]  Chad Westport and Huncho Grown who are both in the chat will be dropping some
[02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:30.540]  home grow knowledge with a few others on a Saturday afternoon mr. toad hopefully
[02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:37.060]  we'll have a toad sighting on here shortly that was the bomb he's the wealth
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:42.940]  of information that guy's got it he he is more dialed in than any other grower
[02:12:42.940 --> 02:12:49.140]  breeder as far as the plants actual physiology how breeding works and stuff
[02:12:49.140 --> 02:12:55.140]  I love listening to him talk on that subject and it's amazing hearing all the
[02:12:55.140 --> 02:13:01.860]  science that guy is absorbed in regurgitates yeah so then Thursday we
[02:13:01.860 --> 02:13:08.620]  got Layton and Brian I'm blanking on who the guest is but he is in Pennsylvania
[02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:13.580]  and and and by the way this conversation I appreciate because it was a very you
[02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:22.900]  know I Layton put an idea out there and you absorb the idea and you gave a
[02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:29.820]  logical well-thought-out response slash rebuttal to that idea and I think that
[02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:36.620]  helps everybody and that was kind of my goal for today's conversation and I
[02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:41.660]  thought it was an important conversation to have and people can you
[02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:46.740]  know again you you you take information from a variety of perspectives and you
[02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:52.340]  synthesize them and we're oil painting emissions same thing we do oil painting
[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:57.580]  and when you're studying up past the basics is you go spend a week studying
[02:13:57.580 --> 02:14:01.900]  under a master and you copy exactly what that person is doing and then you go
[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:07.220]  home and you push that potato around and then you back away from it and you
[02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:11.820]  leave it alone you think about it and you let it incorporate you find what
[02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:17.020]  worked in that for you right and and then you develop your own style and one
[02:14:17.020 --> 02:14:20.020]  of my actions is everybody's different everyone's garden is different everyone's
[02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:23.620]  soil everyone's water everyone's air is literally different your genetics are
[02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:27.140]  different we all have a different situation somewhere between what I
[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:31.220]  presented today and what Layton presented in his you know in his
[02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:36.780]  presentation is that sweet spot for you right you know you might not be able to
[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:41.140]  ever buy a bag of vermiculite and that river clay is all you got use its
[02:14:41.140 --> 02:14:45.580]  burial link you know don't don't choke your system out but understand how that
[02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:49.220]  stuff operates and study more up on clay knowing that there's literally six
[02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:52.820]  different chemical structures of clays and each one does a little bit different
[02:14:53.780 --> 02:14:58.900]  yeah right and we had a bunch of questions that maybe we can get to next
[02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:05.180]  week so for example Izzy wants to know your soil recipe so we can we can get to
[02:15:05.180 --> 02:15:11.340]  how you build soil maybe next week yeah I can be the pay-per-view episode yeah
[02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:16.860]  yeah well then all of them you know it's a I'll put I happily put everything I
[02:15:16.860 --> 02:15:20.140]  put on here I'll happily put it everywhere you know if I can put it
[02:15:20.140 --> 02:15:22.780]  someplace I can make a quick penny off it from someone doesn't see us here
[02:15:22.780 --> 02:15:28.260]  I'll do that you know it's a I got I've had too many of my eggs in one basket
[02:15:28.260 --> 02:15:32.460]  and I need to spread that around a little and Chris we are long form
[02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:41.620]  content here none of that hour-long conversation yeah that's when this is
[02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:46.620]  the how-to classes it's a 10-minute session literally it's like you got to
[02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:51.060]  be in 10 minutes and it's done and done for five minutes or whatever and so
[02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:55.940]  there's that's a whole different format where I'd be selling myself to someone
[02:15:55.940 --> 02:16:00.660]  asked about a K bean brains I've reached out I reached out to him a while ago
[02:16:00.660 --> 02:16:13.260]  I'll check back in with him out of Alaska but anyway I think the sooner we
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:17.780]  wrap up the sooner I get these packs to the post off my daughter's out of school
[02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:21.020]  right now and she's gonna be here in a couple minutes and we're heading skiing
[02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:26.700]  for the evening I'm very jealous Virginia herbs will cue you up next week
[02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:34.620]  I think with Toro and hair so by the way I the future cannabis project some a
[02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:40.420]  bunch of t-shirts came in Brent someone asked about Brandon rust he's been super
[02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:49.740]  busy but he'll be back soon but anyway I think I'm sure I'm missing a bunch of
[02:16:49.740 --> 02:16:59.100]  stuff but everybody have a good rest well I'll be back later mr. toad yeah
[02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:06.460]  let's do it just ping me and we'll we'll make it happen
[02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:22.620]  yes Pat up there we go appreciate y'all namaste be kind grow on stay in the
[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:36.260]  proper harmonic and think see you next time
