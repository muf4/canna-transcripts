[00:00.000 --> 00:02.760]  So I'm Sam from the Grow Offs.
[00:02.760 --> 00:05.280]  We run a science-based competition
[00:05.280 --> 00:08.880]  where we're reliant on excellence in breeding
[00:08.880 --> 00:11.220]  because everyone starts with identical genetics
[00:11.220 --> 00:13.280]  and then they're judged by lab results
[00:13.280 --> 00:16.000]  for total care and total cannabinoids.
[00:17.000 --> 00:21.080]  So I reach out to whoever is crumpling
[00:21.080 --> 00:22.960]  their joint here.
[00:22.960 --> 00:23.800]  Oh my God.
[00:23.800 --> 00:25.960]  Right now, remember that is?
[00:28.040 --> 00:29.600]  There, it stopped. Cool, thank you.
[00:29.600 --> 00:31.280]  So yeah, I reached out to Peter
[00:31.280 --> 00:33.800]  because it's our biggest year ever.
[00:33.800 --> 00:36.280]  We're going to eight states.
[00:36.280 --> 00:38.480]  This podcast is actually representing
[00:38.480 --> 00:40.940]  every single time zone in the country
[00:40.940 --> 00:43.960]  and we need quality breeders state by state
[00:43.960 --> 00:46.520]  to give out these cuts to our growers.
[00:46.520 --> 00:47.840]  We put them through the ringer.
[00:47.840 --> 00:49.800]  You know, they have to meet certain metrics,
[00:49.800 --> 00:53.740]  pass certain tests, pest inspections, et cetera.
[00:53.740 --> 00:55.140]  It's an awesome group of guys.
[00:55.140 --> 00:56.320]  I wanted to get them all together,
[00:56.320 --> 00:59.360]  although I had to wear my buy weed from women shirt
[01:00.120 --> 01:01.720]  because I'm looking for a female,
[01:01.720 --> 01:03.840]  like ladies that do some breeding and genetics
[01:03.840 --> 01:04.680]  for next year.
[01:04.680 --> 01:05.560]  So hit us up.
[01:06.560 --> 01:09.560]  Let's, I guess, go through introductions.
[01:09.560 --> 01:10.440]  That makes sense, right?
[01:10.440 --> 01:13.200]  So this weekend we just handed out clones
[01:13.200 --> 01:17.680]  in Michigan and Oklahoma
[01:17.680 --> 01:19.960]  and let's meet them first.
[01:19.960 --> 01:22.720]  So Michigan's on the East Coast,
[01:22.720 --> 01:24.320]  so technically you're first.
[01:24.320 --> 01:28.000]  So I'll introduce Ross from Fresh Seeds.
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.680]  And I don't know if we can hear,
[01:30.680 --> 01:33.280]  if we can get questions from people tuning in,
[01:33.280 --> 01:34.200]  that would be cool.
[01:34.200 --> 01:36.360]  And then they can ask anything they want
[01:36.360 --> 01:39.200]  except what the mystery strain is, flower time.
[01:39.200 --> 01:41.080]  Like we can't talk about what they got,
[01:41.080 --> 01:44.280]  but we can get to know these breeders and genetics partners.
[01:44.280 --> 01:48.520]  So Ross, Fresh Coast Seeds, our Michigan partner.
[01:48.520 --> 01:49.360]  What's up?
[01:51.760 --> 01:53.600]  So Ross, what do you want to tell,
[01:53.600 --> 01:56.760]  what can you tell us about yourself, your process,
[01:56.800 --> 01:58.480]  what you love about Michigan?
[02:00.360 --> 02:02.880]  Well, those are pretty broad, but yeah.
[02:02.880 --> 02:06.680]  So I'm born and raised in Michigan, 39 years old.
[02:08.520 --> 02:12.800]  I guess just how I got even into cannabis,
[02:12.800 --> 02:15.240]  I was younger, you know, and like in high school,
[02:15.240 --> 02:18.160]  hustling bricks of weed and, you know,
[02:18.160 --> 02:19.200]  doing the thing, right?
[02:19.200 --> 02:21.160]  And I always had a passion for it,
[02:21.160 --> 02:23.560]  but then throughout life I did other things.
[02:23.560 --> 02:26.720]  And then I had a major back injury in the Bering Sea.
[02:27.560 --> 02:31.560]  So I came home and just kind of had to rework my whole life.
[02:31.560 --> 02:35.120]  So I got into like Third Coast Garden
[02:35.120 --> 02:37.120]  and I worked with him for a while.
[02:37.120 --> 02:40.280]  And then I started doing my own thing.
[02:40.280 --> 02:44.320]  And I really never had any intention of,
[02:44.320 --> 02:48.400]  necessarily of breeding, but I was like, you know,
[02:48.400 --> 02:49.640]  up at four in the morning,
[02:49.640 --> 02:52.720]  buying thousands of dollars worth of seeds
[02:52.720 --> 02:54.960]  and looking at all the lineages.
[02:57.560 --> 03:02.320]  And one thing led to another,
[03:02.320 --> 03:04.720]  and it took me about six years to lock down
[03:04.720 --> 03:06.800]  like nine females.
[03:06.800 --> 03:09.320]  And I don't know, I'm pretty picky
[03:09.320 --> 03:11.880]  when it comes to plant selection,
[03:11.880 --> 03:14.400]  but I came up with these females.
[03:14.400 --> 03:16.240]  And then like I was telling you,
[03:16.240 --> 03:19.680]  I had an experience just having a conversation
[03:19.680 --> 03:22.320]  with the universe and I just got,
[03:22.320 --> 03:24.320]  I was really sick of doing production stuff.
[03:25.240 --> 03:29.200]  And she gave me the idea of Fresh Coast Seed Company
[03:29.200 --> 03:30.960]  and starting a seed company.
[03:30.960 --> 03:35.960]  So within 24 hours, I had Fresh Coast Seed Company LLC.
[03:36.080 --> 03:38.800]  And I moved out of the lake houses
[03:38.800 --> 03:42.000]  and we went and bought 20 acres in Bel Air.
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.520]  And we started breeding immediately
[03:45.520 --> 03:50.520]  and I had the right females to do it with and everything.
[03:50.520 --> 03:52.720]  And that was seven years ago.
[03:52.760 --> 03:57.280]  So here we are now and the brand has actually gotten
[03:57.280 --> 03:58.800]  way bigger than what I can handle.
[03:58.800 --> 04:01.020]  So I'm working on that part right now.
[04:02.480 --> 04:04.680]  But yeah, so that's just kind of a little rundown
[04:04.680 --> 04:06.640]  of how I got to where I'm at right now.
[04:08.080 --> 04:09.640]  Awesome, thank you.
[04:09.640 --> 04:10.480]  Yeah.
[04:10.480 --> 04:12.280]  Ooh, this is a cool layout, love this.
[04:12.280 --> 04:15.000]  Okay, cool, let's bring up Robbie from Nerds Genetics,
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.640]  our Oklahoma genetic partner.
[04:17.640 --> 04:18.880]  Welcome, Robbie.
[04:18.880 --> 04:20.920]  Hey, trying to find an angle that gets me in the camera.
[04:20.920 --> 04:21.920]  Here we go.
[04:21.920 --> 04:24.440]  All right, hey, welcome everybody.
[04:24.440 --> 04:29.360]  Yeah, so this year I did the Oklahoma drop.
[04:29.360 --> 04:34.360]  We did the Colorado drop last year for the clone selection.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.280]  You know, this year we had a little bit experience
[04:39.280 --> 04:41.160]  with the contest.
[04:41.160 --> 04:46.160]  So we had a little bit of, I would say different parameters
[04:46.480 --> 04:49.760]  when we were selecting for the contest in Oklahoma
[04:49.760 --> 04:53.240]  knowing a lot more about how the contest works,
[04:53.240 --> 04:55.480]  you know, and a lot of the things
[04:55.480 --> 04:58.400]  that we could potentially see in the contest.
[04:59.360 --> 05:02.120]  Because yeah, when we did our Colorado one,
[05:02.120 --> 05:05.360]  we broke a couple records, you know, both good and bad.
[05:05.360 --> 05:06.600]  We broke records.
[05:07.820 --> 05:08.660]  Am I not talking?
[05:11.080 --> 05:12.320]  Sam, can you hear me?
[05:12.320 --> 05:13.160]  No, we can hear you.
[05:13.160 --> 05:14.360]  There's just other people in the background
[05:14.360 --> 05:15.760]  that I'm saying to mute yourself
[05:15.760 --> 05:17.480]  because we hear everything going on back there,
[05:17.480 --> 05:19.440]  but you're fine, I hear you.
[05:20.080 --> 05:21.000]  Sorry about that.
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.560]  I just got confused.
[05:22.560 --> 05:26.520]  Anyway, so yeah, we broke a couple records in Colorado.
[05:26.520 --> 05:28.280]  One bad one for most Hermes
[05:28.280 --> 05:30.520]  and one good one for highest Herps.
[05:30.520 --> 05:33.700]  So, you know, that's just how it works sometimes.
[05:34.920 --> 05:39.920]  But when we went and had seen how the contest works
[05:40.240 --> 05:43.360]  and knew a lot more about it,
[05:43.360 --> 05:45.720]  you know, it changed the way we selected for it.
[05:45.720 --> 05:47.120]  When I selected in Colorado,
[05:47.120 --> 05:48.840]  I was really trying to select for something
[05:49.280 --> 05:51.880]  that had the potential to break some records.
[05:52.880 --> 05:56.020]  And when we did it in Oklahoma,
[05:56.020 --> 05:57.760]  we were really looking for something
[05:57.760 --> 06:00.320]  that was going to be, you know,
[06:00.320 --> 06:02.280]  something that could be a staple strain out here,
[06:02.280 --> 06:04.320]  something that was really different from anything
[06:04.320 --> 06:08.200]  that is being seen on any of the shelves out here
[06:08.200 --> 06:13.200]  or, you know, any of the things that are sort of
[06:13.760 --> 06:15.600]  what is hitting the norm, you know,
[06:15.600 --> 06:17.380]  like Oklahoma is a new market.
[06:17.380 --> 06:20.540]  So we're seeing a lot of the same 10 strains
[06:20.540 --> 06:22.820]  that get recycled out here.
[06:22.820 --> 06:24.580]  So we tried to bring something
[06:24.580 --> 06:27.060]  that was going to be a totally different flavor profile,
[06:27.060 --> 06:29.460]  something that was going to be a totally different high
[06:29.460 --> 06:32.220]  than anything that is really being brought
[06:32.220 --> 06:33.260]  to the table right now.
[06:33.260 --> 06:36.860]  And so that's what we brought for the Oklahoma on the show.
[06:40.650 --> 06:41.770]  Oh, Sam, you're muted.
[06:45.500 --> 06:47.000]  Cool, yeah, so that's a good point, Robbie.
[06:47.000 --> 06:48.500]  Thank you that like I mentioned,
[06:48.500 --> 06:51.260]  we have certain metrics that we ask all of you guys
[06:51.780 --> 06:53.980]  to hit when we look at strains and you know,
[06:54.940 --> 06:56.400]  who is that crunching?
[06:58.860 --> 07:02.620]  Yeah, so in one of those is, it can't be me, is it?
[07:06.670 --> 07:08.190]  Me?
[07:08.190 --> 07:11.270]  Okay, yeah, so in one of those metrics is like
[07:11.270 --> 07:12.910]  that we are looking for something
[07:12.910 --> 07:14.310]  that's not widely on the market
[07:14.310 --> 07:17.510]  because we take these six months of the competition,
[07:17.510 --> 07:21.030]  you know, hyping up all these growers, this mystery strain,
[07:21.030 --> 07:22.390]  everyone that's in a competition
[07:22.390 --> 07:24.510]  is gonna bother every single one of you and say,
[07:24.510 --> 07:25.350]  what is it?
[07:25.350 --> 07:26.590]  Tell me, tell me.
[07:26.590 --> 07:27.790]  They'll be making their guesses
[07:27.790 --> 07:29.270]  and you guys have to keep your mouth shut
[07:29.270 --> 07:30.750]  because it's part of the fun.
[07:30.750 --> 07:33.070]  And we wanna make sure it's something cool.
[07:33.070 --> 07:35.230]  So when it hits the market at the end of the year,
[07:35.230 --> 07:37.030]  it flies off shelves.
[07:37.030 --> 07:38.630]  I mean, hey, Dave.
[07:39.870 --> 07:42.750]  And so yeah, that's one of the metrics.
[07:42.750 --> 07:45.990]  The other is, you know, we do pest and pathogen testing
[07:45.990 --> 07:48.670]  to make sure these are very clean cuts as well.
[07:48.670 --> 07:51.990]  If people watching don't know what hops late in thyroid is,
[07:52.590 --> 07:54.750]  I encourage you to Google it, reach out to any of us here.
[07:54.750 --> 07:57.070]  I'm sure we can talk to you through all that.
[07:57.070 --> 08:00.590]  So just to recap, Michigan, Oklahoma dropped on Sunday,
[08:00.590 --> 08:04.250]  but you can still pick up clones there this week only.
[08:04.250 --> 08:07.590]  You can just DM us or sign up at the growoff.com.
[08:07.590 --> 08:09.070]  And let's move on.
[08:09.070 --> 08:13.550]  Our next clone drop will be in Colorado, our home state,
[08:13.550 --> 08:15.550]  with Dark Horse Genetics.
[08:15.550 --> 08:18.990]  And I'm gonna introduce Cesar now who's doing that one.
[08:18.990 --> 08:21.150]  How's it going, everybody?
[08:22.870 --> 08:23.710]  I'm not gonna mute it.
[08:23.710 --> 08:24.530]  Can you hear me?
[08:24.530 --> 08:25.370]  Let me go.
[08:28.250 --> 08:29.090]  Hello?
[08:30.050 --> 08:33.690]  We can hear you, but your wifi is a little choppy.
[08:33.690 --> 08:35.490]  Yeah, that's nothing around here.
[08:38.250 --> 08:41.330]  Yeah, if anything, we have the genetics ready.
[08:41.330 --> 08:43.810]  I got them in the clone a few days ago.
[08:43.810 --> 08:45.170]  So I'm looking at them.
[08:45.170 --> 08:48.170]  They're behind me, just looking for them.
[08:48.170 --> 08:49.610]  I got way more than I needed,
[08:49.610 --> 08:51.530]  but I'd rather have more than I need
[08:51.530 --> 08:56.790]  and less than I need at this point.
[08:56.790 --> 08:57.630]  I love it.
[08:57.630 --> 08:58.950]  So actually, Cesar, I needed to ask you,
[08:58.950 --> 09:01.110]  because we're getting close to the number
[09:01.110 --> 09:02.670]  that you told me we had to cut it off at.
[09:02.670 --> 09:05.270]  Do we have more entries available
[09:05.270 --> 09:06.990]  or we got to cut it at 100?
[09:06.990 --> 09:10.230]  So there's 206 in the cloner right now,
[09:10.230 --> 09:11.790]  assuming everyone roots.
[09:11.790 --> 09:13.150]  Okay.
[09:13.150 --> 09:14.390]  Should have more than I need.
[09:14.390 --> 09:16.950]  But if anything, once I get a little closer to the data,
[09:16.950 --> 09:18.550]  I could possibly feel more comfortable
[09:18.550 --> 09:21.390]  about opening it up to a little bit more people.
[09:21.390 --> 09:22.230]  Perfect.
[09:22.230 --> 09:23.270]  All right, we'll keep you all posted.
[09:23.270 --> 09:25.590]  I think we have like maybe 10 spots left
[09:25.590 --> 09:27.230]  if we're keeping at 100,
[09:27.230 --> 09:28.710]  but actually this is a good point.
[09:28.710 --> 09:31.150]  So not only do they have to get us cuts
[09:31.150 --> 09:32.910]  for all of the participants,
[09:32.910 --> 09:34.510]  but you have to grow more than you need
[09:34.510 --> 09:38.590]  so that we have an even crop
[09:38.590 --> 09:40.310]  so that everyone's getting the same thing.
[09:40.310 --> 09:43.030]  So a lot of challenges we throw at you guys.
[09:43.030 --> 09:45.870]  I appreciate you so much for doing this.
[09:45.870 --> 09:50.750]  So the one after Colorado is going to be California.
[09:50.790 --> 09:53.190]  And because it's the biggest frigging state,
[09:53.190 --> 09:54.870]  we have to do three clone drops.
[09:54.870 --> 09:59.110]  Those are gonna be in Humboldt, Oakland and San Diego.
[09:59.110 --> 10:03.550]  And I will introduce Daniel and Dave from Hendrix Farm now.
[10:04.590 --> 10:06.030]  How much of us are in the frame?
[10:06.030 --> 10:07.390]  Are we both in the frame?
[10:07.390 --> 10:08.230]  Yep.
[10:08.230 --> 10:09.590]  Nice.
[10:09.590 --> 10:12.150]  Yeah, this is Dave, I'm Daniel.
[10:12.150 --> 10:13.470]  We're with Hendrix Nursery.
[10:13.470 --> 10:15.150]  We're in Humboldt County.
[10:15.150 --> 10:15.990]  We're stoked to do this.
[10:15.990 --> 10:18.510]  This is our fourth year doing the grow off.
[10:19.390 --> 10:22.830]  It's kind of our favorite and like most unique challenge
[10:22.830 --> 10:26.990]  is get everybody perfect, unique clones on a date
[10:26.990 --> 10:29.270]  and keep a mystery strain
[10:30.350 --> 10:32.110]  that you guys haven't seen before.
[10:32.110 --> 10:34.230]  And I think we did a really good job this year.
[10:34.230 --> 10:36.430]  We love working with Sam
[10:36.430 --> 10:38.310]  and it's really fun to be here on this call,
[10:38.310 --> 10:39.990]  get to see all the other breeders.
[10:39.990 --> 10:41.510]  It's like, I wish I...
[10:41.510 --> 10:43.310]  I was a fan of the grow off
[10:43.310 --> 10:45.710]  before we ever were asked to be the nursery.
[10:45.710 --> 10:47.990]  It just seemed like the coolest thing to compete in.
[10:48.950 --> 10:51.150]  And we wish we could grow all your guys' genetics,
[10:51.150 --> 10:53.150]  all the other breeders out there.
[10:53.150 --> 10:54.790]  Be really fun to go from state to state.
[10:54.790 --> 10:56.550]  Yeah, be dope to do a strain swap.
[10:57.630 --> 10:58.910]  Can we make that happen?
[11:01.870 --> 11:03.630]  Let's take this to WhatsApp.
[11:03.630 --> 11:04.470]  Hi.
[11:04.470 --> 11:05.310]  Hi.
[11:05.310 --> 11:06.150]  Hi.
[11:06.150 --> 11:06.990]  Hi.
[11:06.990 --> 11:08.510]  Ping me.
[11:08.510 --> 11:09.350]  Yeah, I mean, Daniel,
[11:09.350 --> 11:12.190]  you've been reaching out to previous year's
[11:12.190 --> 11:14.190]  genetic partners and linking up with them.
[11:14.190 --> 11:15.310]  I thought that was so cool.
[11:15.350 --> 11:18.390]  And like the one person who was not able to be here,
[11:18.390 --> 11:19.230]  I was bummed.
[11:19.230 --> 11:23.350]  We have like an SOP officer now,
[11:23.350 --> 11:26.350]  Wendy Kornberg from Sunabyss wrote up some SOPs.
[11:26.350 --> 11:28.230]  So we're all kind of on the same page.
[11:28.230 --> 11:30.190]  Everyone's state to state is getting,
[11:30.190 --> 11:33.870]  similar clones or just quality.
[11:33.870 --> 11:36.150]  And she could not be here today,
[11:36.150 --> 11:38.430]  but, and I totally lost my train of thought
[11:38.430 --> 11:39.430]  where we were headed,
[11:39.430 --> 11:42.950]  but she's, oh, she's trying to grab one of each of them.
[11:42.950 --> 11:44.670]  Cause she's doing those pest inspections.
[11:45.030 --> 11:47.150]  She's sending folks to do those for her.
[11:47.150 --> 11:50.070]  So she's going to try to grow every single one of them.
[11:50.070 --> 11:51.710]  But if you all want to try to connect,
[11:51.710 --> 11:53.230]  I think that would be very fun too.
[11:53.230 --> 11:55.830]  Maybe do some crosses for future grow off projects.
[11:55.830 --> 11:57.150]  That would be very fun.
[11:57.150 --> 11:58.110]  Yeah.
[11:58.110 --> 11:59.590]  That's my favorite part about this.
[11:59.590 --> 12:02.510]  And it's cool to get the contestants too.
[12:02.510 --> 12:04.630]  It just interlinking with everybody.
[12:04.630 --> 12:06.710]  It's a good way to find genetics is just working
[12:06.710 --> 12:09.310]  with the people that are growing the stuff too.
[12:09.310 --> 12:11.510]  So as well as the people on this call,
[12:11.510 --> 12:13.590]  but you know, contestants as well.
[12:13.630 --> 12:14.550]  It's a lot of fun.
[12:15.990 --> 12:16.830]  For sure.
[12:16.830 --> 12:19.350]  Okay. Well, I will help facilitate that if I can.
[12:20.190 --> 12:23.030]  Okay. So next on the calendar, I know.
[12:23.030 --> 12:25.870]  Okay. So Virginia, we're still looking for a venue,
[12:27.430 --> 12:30.270]  but I'm going to bring you up next actually, Mario.
[12:30.270 --> 12:32.190]  So this is an interesting story.
[12:32.190 --> 12:34.550]  Oh, and if anyone watching has a friendly venue
[12:34.550 --> 12:35.750]  for us to do a clone drop,
[12:35.750 --> 12:37.950]  I'm looking for something near the DC area.
[12:37.950 --> 12:41.390]  Please DM us, email me, sam at the grow off.com.
[12:42.310 --> 12:43.470]  But this is an interesting story.
[12:44.350 --> 12:47.750]  So we met Mario because he won our like beauty pageant,
[12:47.750 --> 12:49.550]  bud battle challenge.
[12:49.550 --> 12:52.190]  And it was with something really interesting.
[12:52.190 --> 12:53.790]  Obviously everyone liked the photo
[12:53.790 --> 12:55.510]  and they knew what the strain was.
[12:55.510 --> 12:57.950]  Cause we advertise that as part of the battles.
[12:57.950 --> 12:59.350]  And I said, Hey, we're interested
[12:59.350 --> 13:00.710]  in doing a Virginia grow off.
[13:00.710 --> 13:04.190]  Do you want to release Lehefa as the mystery strain?
[13:04.190 --> 13:06.830]  It's the first time we've ever told anyone what it was.
[13:06.830 --> 13:11.110]  So the first ever like purposeful release
[13:11.110 --> 13:13.270]  of the mystery strain.
[13:14.070 --> 13:16.710]  So Mario from eating stars on Mars, welcome.
[13:16.710 --> 13:17.870]  Hey, what's up?
[13:19.350 --> 13:20.350]  How are you today?
[13:20.350 --> 13:21.190]  Good, all right.
[13:21.190 --> 13:23.750]  So, yeah, I mean, it's been pretty interesting
[13:23.750 --> 13:25.590]  with this whole thing that went down.
[13:27.110 --> 13:28.910]  You know, I didn't expect to win bud battles
[13:28.910 --> 13:30.470]  going against somebody that had like,
[13:30.470 --> 13:33.870]  I guess they had like 30,000 some followers.
[13:33.870 --> 13:35.950]  You know, I'm here just starting up my IG
[13:35.950 --> 13:39.990]  like a couple of years ago and just having fun with it.
[13:40.870 --> 13:43.470]  I've been growing for a minute.
[13:43.470 --> 13:46.350]  I know in Virginia, we're going on a year soon
[13:48.070 --> 13:49.350]  when it comes to home grow,
[13:49.350 --> 13:52.470]  but I've been growing a little bit longer than that.
[13:52.470 --> 13:53.670]  So it's not a VA.
[13:53.670 --> 13:57.070]  It's, I don't want to say like I've been doing some hot shit
[13:57.070 --> 14:00.350]  you know what I'm saying or something, but yeah,
[14:00.350 --> 14:02.190]  I've been doing a lot of here and there
[14:02.190 --> 14:03.710]  throughout the DMV area.
[14:03.710 --> 14:06.950]  If that's what you want to call it pretty much.
[14:06.990 --> 14:10.510]  Cause it's, you know, like a Maryland, DC, Virginia thing.
[14:10.510 --> 14:12.590]  So we're all connected.
[14:12.590 --> 14:14.550]  It's a lot of good growers out here,
[14:15.870 --> 14:17.310]  a lot of good genetics as well.
[14:17.310 --> 14:20.110]  So it's exciting to just be a part
[14:20.110 --> 14:24.110]  of this little family right here and see how things go.
[14:24.110 --> 14:26.030]  So especially with Lehefa,
[14:26.030 --> 14:29.390]  she's I've been growing her for four years now.
[14:29.390 --> 14:32.190]  So I've got her really dialed in.
[14:32.190 --> 14:36.110]  So that picture was like right at its peak
[14:36.110 --> 14:37.710]  where she's been amazing.
[14:37.710 --> 14:38.550]  You know what I mean?
[14:38.550 --> 14:41.550]  Just getting a lot of clones off of her
[14:41.550 --> 14:43.390]  trying to like branch her out a lot.
[14:43.390 --> 14:46.350]  But yeah, it's just been amazing, man.
[14:46.350 --> 14:48.350]  This whole thing is, I'm excited for it,
[14:48.350 --> 14:49.790]  especially for Virginia.
[14:49.790 --> 14:53.790]  Cause I know here it's a lot of low key folks out here,
[14:53.790 --> 14:55.670]  but they've been growing for a minute.
[14:55.670 --> 14:57.910]  But for me, I think it's time for them to just come out
[14:57.910 --> 15:00.910]  and have some fun with this competition.
[15:02.390 --> 15:03.470]  Perfect. Thank you.
[15:03.470 --> 15:05.830]  So yes, we think we have a venue,
[15:06.430 --> 15:07.590]  again, if anyone's watching,
[15:07.590 --> 15:09.550]  knows some Virginia folks, let us know.
[15:10.830 --> 15:15.830]  Okay. So next on the calendar is May, I believe.
[15:16.270 --> 15:17.350]  Wait, hold up one second.
[15:17.350 --> 15:18.190]  I was muted.
[15:18.190 --> 15:19.270]  I was trying to get your attention.
[15:19.270 --> 15:24.270]  So hit up Lou because he has a venue in Virginia.
[15:24.390 --> 15:27.110]  We, yeah, Lou and I are chatting the venue.
[15:27.110 --> 15:28.990]  Yeah, we're, yes, I'm talking to Lou.
[15:28.990 --> 15:32.110]  We're hoping to collab on a gene traders
[15:32.110 --> 15:34.870]  at the Virginia clone drop for the grow off.
[15:34.910 --> 15:37.270]  So that would be extra special.
[15:37.270 --> 15:39.110]  It would just require a little bit more space
[15:39.110 --> 15:41.670]  and 420 friendly venue where we're just
[15:41.670 --> 15:42.710]  need to hand out clones.
[15:42.710 --> 15:44.430]  So yes, thank you, Ross.
[15:45.510 --> 15:47.470]  And if any, and I'm assuming we have a lot of growers
[15:47.470 --> 15:49.630]  watching, if you don't know what a gene traders event is,
[15:49.630 --> 15:50.470]  they're awesome.
[15:50.470 --> 15:53.390]  It's a pop-up seeding clone event where you can just get
[15:53.390 --> 15:55.310]  the latest and greatest in genetics.
[15:55.310 --> 15:58.310]  They're all over the country and they're awesome.
[15:58.310 --> 16:02.950]  Okay. So next on our calendar is May or sorry, June 25th.
[16:02.990 --> 16:06.430]  We will be in Maine with Bangladesh farms.
[16:06.430 --> 16:09.350]  And I, Peter, hopefully you can put John and Jason
[16:09.350 --> 16:10.910]  on the screen at the same time.
[16:12.110 --> 16:13.310]  I think that's possible.
[16:17.900 --> 16:19.180]  Well, while they work on it.
[16:19.180 --> 16:23.180]  Okay. We got John on screen and then Jason
[16:24.900 --> 16:26.620]  and Jason you're muted by the way.
[16:28.860 --> 16:29.700]  Gotcha.
[16:29.700 --> 16:30.820]  There we go.
[16:30.820 --> 16:31.700]  Nice.
[16:31.700 --> 16:34.260]  So yeah, a little background on us.
[16:34.260 --> 16:37.060]  I guess I've been playing with this plant for about 25
[16:37.060 --> 16:38.500]  years, pretty seriously.
[16:38.500 --> 16:42.140]  Did a couple of breeds for some outdoor folks here in Maine
[16:42.140 --> 16:47.140]  since we have such short seasons and wet finishes.
[16:48.300 --> 16:49.980]  They really have to be some early finishers
[16:49.980 --> 16:51.380]  and very hardy plants.
[16:51.380 --> 16:54.540]  So that was kind of like my first edition on my,
[16:54.540 --> 16:56.900]  what I was trying to breed for this area.
[16:56.900 --> 16:59.780]  Then kind of threw together some really deep OG lines
[16:59.780 --> 17:01.540]  with the Fotea stuff.
[17:01.540 --> 17:04.060]  Came to this farm, kind of started a new awakening
[17:04.860 --> 17:06.780]  and passion for this plant after taking about a good year
[17:06.780 --> 17:10.020]  off from before we got this 7,200 square foot spot up
[17:10.020 --> 17:10.980]  and ready to go.
[17:10.980 --> 17:14.580]  So now we're excited because we just popped about 700
[17:14.580 --> 17:16.300]  plus seeds and just.
[17:16.300 --> 17:17.140]  Yeah.
[17:34.440 --> 17:36.760]  Uh-oh, Wi-Fi has to mix up.
[17:38.600 --> 17:40.760]  Oh, I must've lost it, huh?
[17:40.760 --> 17:42.880]  Yeah, a little bit.
[17:42.880 --> 17:45.480]  We lost you at the 700 seeds.
[17:46.480 --> 17:49.960]  Oh yeah, so now with this 700 seed project,
[17:49.960 --> 17:51.720]  hopefully this will give everybody a good view
[17:51.720 --> 17:54.080]  into what we're working with moving forward.
[17:55.360 --> 17:57.400]  So the selection that we'll be using will be
[17:57.400 --> 17:59.040]  from that 700 plus seed hunt.
[17:59.040 --> 18:02.200]  So we're really excited to see what this results should be
[18:02.200 --> 18:06.400]  because we're really fresh and working with it now as it is.
[18:06.400 --> 18:10.880]  So we'll be, you know, pushing these strains moving forward.
[18:10.880 --> 18:13.360]  So I think it'll be fun to see the test results
[18:13.360 --> 18:14.960]  and see how people do with them.
[18:16.120 --> 18:16.960]  Oh yeah.
[18:19.400 --> 18:20.600]  100%.
[18:20.600 --> 18:22.840]  Yeah, John, you got anything to add?
[18:22.840 --> 18:25.680]  No, I mean, for me, it's kind of like,
[18:25.680 --> 18:27.920]  obviously I started smoking real young,
[18:27.920 --> 18:30.680]  started slinging, originally from Boston,
[18:30.680 --> 18:32.400]  started slinging packs in college.
[18:32.400 --> 18:36.080]  So kind of giving the kids in the area something good.
[18:37.120 --> 18:38.840]  Used to go up to Maine to grab the stuff.
[18:38.840 --> 18:41.000]  I ended up moving up there,
[18:41.000 --> 18:44.440]  kind of passionate about the plant.
[18:44.440 --> 18:47.960]  So ended up hooking up with Jason and we just,
[18:47.960 --> 18:50.280]  you know, this is our passion project
[18:50.280 --> 18:53.320]  and we've taken our time for the last two years,
[18:53.320 --> 18:54.720]  building the place out,
[18:54.720 --> 18:57.080]  making sure everything was done right.
[18:57.080 --> 19:00.200]  And, you know, making the decision to pop the seeds
[19:00.200 --> 19:01.360]  was the best thing we ever did
[19:01.360 --> 19:04.360]  because we didn't have to worry about anything going around.
[19:05.440 --> 19:08.120]  And we don't have to worry about taking anyone's cuts
[19:08.120 --> 19:11.760]  in to get going and then end up with a virus or bugs
[19:11.760 --> 19:12.600]  or anything like that.
[19:12.600 --> 19:14.280]  So it was a good decision.
[19:15.120 --> 19:16.960]  And we're just excited to kind of be part of this thing
[19:16.960 --> 19:19.480]  right in, you know, June 25th
[19:19.480 --> 19:21.160]  at Urban Garden Centers in Maine.
[19:21.160 --> 19:23.440]  We're gonna have an awesome drop.
[19:23.440 --> 19:24.680]  So we're looking forward to it,
[19:24.680 --> 19:27.510]  seeing what everyone grows.
[19:28.990 --> 19:29.830]  Perfect.
[19:29.830 --> 19:30.990]  Thank you guys so much.
[19:30.990 --> 19:33.390]  And then I'm right after Maine,
[19:33.390 --> 19:36.790]  I'm scooting right down to Massachusetts,
[19:36.790 --> 19:38.790]  but I will say our Maine signups,
[19:38.790 --> 19:42.510]  I know there are like thousands of growers in Maine.
[19:42.510 --> 19:43.710]  I don't know where they're at yet.
[19:43.750 --> 19:45.910]  We're gonna have to hustle some Mainers out
[19:45.910 --> 19:47.070]  to pick these cuts up.
[19:47.070 --> 19:47.910]  So-
[19:47.910 --> 19:50.510]  Yeah, maybe some more posts and marketing on our end
[19:50.510 --> 19:53.030]  and we can get them things kicked up.
[19:53.030 --> 19:54.110]  Perfect.
[19:54.110 --> 19:54.950]  So yeah.
[19:54.950 --> 19:56.350]  Absolutely.
[19:56.350 --> 19:58.470]  Maine's been bugging us to come there for years.
[19:58.470 --> 20:00.550]  So this should be a good turnout
[20:00.550 --> 20:03.350]  once they get signed up and everything.
[20:03.350 --> 20:08.350]  So after Maine, I'm scooting right down to Worcester, Mass,
[20:08.830 --> 20:11.990]  where our breeder Fat Cat Select Seeds
[20:11.990 --> 20:13.590]  is providing the cut this year.
[20:14.430 --> 20:15.270]  Welcome Travis.
[20:19.040 --> 20:20.080]  I think you're muted.
[20:22.320 --> 20:23.680]  You're muted, Travis.
[20:28.690 --> 20:29.690]  Oh, there you go.
[20:29.690 --> 20:30.930]  That better?
[20:30.930 --> 20:31.770]  Yeah.
[20:31.770 --> 20:35.050]  So like Sam said, I'm Travis from Fat Cat Select Seeds.
[20:35.050 --> 20:38.210]  My brother Ian and I do all the breeding,
[20:38.210 --> 20:40.810]  the whole everything right from start to finish.
[20:42.530 --> 20:45.690]  We called it Select Seeds because we actually
[20:45.690 --> 20:47.730]  individually look at every single seed
[20:47.730 --> 20:49.370]  before we sell and package them.
[20:50.210 --> 20:53.250]  So they've been all hand selected, every single one.
[20:54.450 --> 20:56.330]  So to get to a brief history,
[20:56.330 --> 20:58.290]  we grew up on Martha's Vineyard,
[20:58.290 --> 21:01.210]  which is an island off the coast.
[21:01.210 --> 21:04.210]  We've been isolated for years and years and years
[21:04.210 --> 21:07.290]  away from the rest of the world, really, for genetics.
[21:08.130 --> 21:11.250]  And we still are really out here.
[21:11.250 --> 21:13.170]  People really don't know what's going on
[21:13.170 --> 21:14.850]  with the new strains,
[21:14.850 --> 21:18.610]  anything that's happening out there with the popularity.
[21:18.610 --> 21:21.570]  So things have kind of evolved
[21:21.570 --> 21:23.450]  a little differently out here.
[21:23.450 --> 21:25.890]  I can say from the beginning of breeding,
[21:25.890 --> 21:28.410]  it's been growing up, wasn't me who started,
[21:28.410 --> 21:31.770]  it was the previous generation who showed me
[21:31.770 --> 21:35.170]  how to make seeds at a young age,
[21:35.170 --> 21:38.690]  how to select the better plants,
[21:38.690 --> 21:43.690]  how to pick the best ones and go forward with them.
[21:44.690 --> 21:48.410]  So we've always been interested in breeding genetics
[21:48.410 --> 21:51.010]  right from the beginning, not only in cannabis.
[21:51.010 --> 21:54.210]  I've done breeding in other fruits, vegetables,
[21:54.210 --> 21:55.330]  and things like that.
[21:56.330 --> 21:59.530]  So cannabis has always been very fun though.
[21:59.530 --> 22:01.130]  And something that out here,
[22:01.930 --> 22:03.890]  genetics were very hard to come by.
[22:05.050 --> 22:08.650]  So you collected them as best you could.
[22:08.650 --> 22:11.090]  When you found something, you saved it.
[22:11.090 --> 22:12.770]  You tried to keep your clones,
[22:12.770 --> 22:15.290]  you tried to keep your seeds as best you can
[22:15.290 --> 22:17.370]  because you do not wanna lose them
[22:17.370 --> 22:21.210]  because sometimes they're almost impossible to replace.
[22:21.210 --> 22:23.970]  Now that things have changed a little bit,
[22:23.970 --> 22:26.930]  we can access strains and clones
[22:26.930 --> 22:30.450]  through these places all over the world.
[22:30.450 --> 22:32.610]  It's a lot easier with legalization
[22:32.610 --> 22:36.130]  and with the way things are going.
[22:36.130 --> 22:38.370]  So right from the beginning of legalization,
[22:38.370 --> 22:40.570]  we were interested in having our strains tested.
[22:40.570 --> 22:41.810]  It's the first thing we did.
[22:41.810 --> 22:43.690]  We wanted to know what we were growing.
[22:43.690 --> 22:46.770]  We wanted to know what our THC percentages were,
[22:46.770 --> 22:48.690]  what our terpenes were.
[22:48.690 --> 22:51.170]  We wanted to know what plants we liked,
[22:51.170 --> 22:53.490]  what we didn't, why we liked them.
[22:53.490 --> 22:54.450]  There were some plants,
[22:54.450 --> 22:56.570]  you just don't know what terpenes are in them
[22:56.570 --> 22:57.970]  until you have them tested.
[22:57.970 --> 22:59.770]  And when you do, then you know,
[23:00.690 --> 23:04.010]  which is why the grow off is really,
[23:04.010 --> 23:06.330]  really a great competition.
[23:06.330 --> 23:11.330]  It's really in reality, the greatest phenotype hunt of all.
[23:12.170 --> 23:13.810]  Considering that the phenotype
[23:13.810 --> 23:17.370]  is just the environmental expressions of the plant.
[23:17.370 --> 23:20.770]  So each individual clone would be the genotype,
[23:20.770 --> 23:23.330]  but the phenotype is up to each individual grower
[23:23.330 --> 23:25.570]  to create on their own through their fertilizer
[23:25.570 --> 23:27.090]  and their grow rooms.
[23:27.090 --> 23:29.850]  So it's the ultimate contest really,
[23:29.850 --> 23:32.970]  the top that you could do to be a grower.
[23:32.970 --> 23:34.410]  People say phenotype hunt,
[23:34.410 --> 23:36.970]  but phenotype hunt is really
[23:38.330 --> 23:40.970]  the same clone grown differently.
[23:40.970 --> 23:42.450]  When you're searching through seeds,
[23:42.450 --> 23:44.050]  it's really a genotype hunt,
[23:44.050 --> 23:47.250]  but it's really just a common word
[23:47.250 --> 23:49.610]  that's kind of misconception.
[23:49.610 --> 23:54.610]  So, you know, creating genotypes is what we do,
[23:55.410 --> 23:56.430]  what we look for.
[23:57.290 --> 24:02.290]  We basically look to create what we call apex strains.
[24:02.890 --> 24:06.090]  An apex strain, I would consider a strain
[24:06.090 --> 24:09.370]  that best represents the characteristics
[24:09.370 --> 24:12.130]  of whatever you're looking to do.
[24:12.130 --> 24:15.370]  Say it's a blueberry or bubblegum.
[24:15.370 --> 24:18.410]  You're looking to make the best, best tasting,
[24:18.410 --> 24:21.530]  best characteristics of blueberry that you can find.
[24:21.530 --> 24:25.310]  And it may not be everybody's favorite.
[24:25.310 --> 24:27.290]  That's where the breeder comes in.
[24:27.290 --> 24:29.310]  The breeder picks his favorite.
[24:29.310 --> 24:33.650]  And when a breeder gets a reputation locally or wherever,
[24:33.650 --> 24:36.730]  people trust in your nose, what you pick,
[24:36.730 --> 24:39.290]  what you like for your plants.
[24:40.090 --> 24:42.730]  So you get a following and that's really how it started
[24:42.730 --> 24:47.730]  with a back cat and breeding was a following of people
[24:48.450 --> 24:51.490]  and wanting to make better strains
[24:52.890 --> 24:56.390]  and ones that were true to how you wanted them to taste.
[24:56.390 --> 24:58.050]  If I bought blueberry seeds,
[24:58.050 --> 25:01.250]  I want them to taste like blueberry and good blueberry.
[25:01.250 --> 25:04.510]  And if I buy bubblegum, it should taste like bubblegum.
[25:04.510 --> 25:07.130]  So I really liked the classic strains,
[25:07.130 --> 25:09.290]  creating them, recreating them
[25:09.290 --> 25:12.690]  and trying to make them as best as we can.
[25:13.930 --> 25:16.170]  So I love that Sam.
[25:16.170 --> 25:18.370]  I love that because blueberry,
[25:18.370 --> 25:21.410]  I started in the industry co-founding a seed company
[25:21.410 --> 25:26.090]  and we reproduced DJ Short's blueberry
[25:26.090 --> 25:27.330]  as one of our first packs.
[25:27.330 --> 25:28.730]  It was, that's a killer strain.
[25:28.730 --> 25:29.570]  I love that one.
[25:30.670 --> 25:31.850]  Awesome. Well, thank you, Travis.
[25:31.850 --> 25:35.570]  And I'm sorry, I think we got mixed up
[25:35.570 --> 25:37.170]  adding questions from the chat.
[25:37.170 --> 25:39.730]  We'll start doing a round table,
[25:39.730 --> 25:42.690]  but we have one more breeder to introduce.
[25:42.690 --> 25:45.290]  Last and certainly not least, I'm so excited for this one
[25:45.290 --> 25:46.510]  because at the end of the season,
[25:46.510 --> 25:48.530]  we're all gonna need a vacation
[25:48.530 --> 25:52.250]  and we're gonna come visit Jason on Oahu
[25:52.250 --> 25:55.250]  for our very first Hawaii grow-off.
[25:55.250 --> 25:57.650]  So welcome Jason. Aloha.
[25:57.650 --> 25:59.390]  Aloha, everybody.
[25:59.390 --> 26:00.230]  I'm honored to be here.
[26:00.230 --> 26:02.730]  Humble, great people are around us
[26:02.730 --> 26:04.290]  and we're just seeing this over and over again
[26:04.290 --> 26:07.290]  in the cannabis industry, this really cool connection,
[26:07.290 --> 26:08.610]  whether it's Instagram or whatever,
[26:08.610 --> 26:09.810]  it's all coming together.
[26:09.810 --> 26:14.810]  That used to be old smugglers, old growers, old breeders,
[26:15.490 --> 26:16.330]  all that good stuff.
[26:16.330 --> 26:17.150]  It's super fun.
[26:18.570 --> 26:20.370]  It's just such a euphoric life nowadays.
[26:20.370 --> 26:21.690]  It's really cool.
[26:21.690 --> 26:22.530]  I'm in Hawaii.
[26:22.530 --> 26:24.070]  We're kind of stuck in time a little bit,
[26:24.070 --> 26:24.930]  but we're getting there.
[26:24.930 --> 26:28.250]  We're still at a stacking license kind of formula.
[26:28.250 --> 26:31.550]  So you can grow 10 plants per person
[26:31.550 --> 26:33.450]  and there's no limit to where you can,
[26:34.310 --> 26:37.710]  how many plants, how many cards you can have at a site.
[26:37.710 --> 26:39.710]  They've tried to control that and try to regulate it
[26:39.710 --> 26:41.350]  and try to enforce it, but it's never worked.
[26:41.350 --> 26:44.830]  So we've officially become the largest patient-based farm
[26:44.830 --> 26:47.790]  in Hawaii with over 2000 patients on our farm.
[26:47.790 --> 26:50.070]  It's happening because we have dispensaries that are open
[26:50.070 --> 26:53.630]  that aren't providing affordable medicine, good medicine
[26:53.630 --> 26:55.870]  and access to medicine for medical patients.
[26:55.870 --> 26:59.670]  So that's where we came along and, you know,
[26:59.670 --> 27:01.990]  started rolling with the affordable ounce,
[27:01.990 --> 27:03.750]  we call it the $150 onion.
[27:03.750 --> 27:05.390]  So kind of exciting.
[27:05.390 --> 27:06.750]  And then we bring, you know,
[27:06.750 --> 27:09.470]  blueberry back into the picture and man,
[27:09.470 --> 27:11.030]  a good blueberry is hard to beat, man.
[27:11.030 --> 27:13.230]  I remember I was in Vancouver about 10 years ago
[27:13.230 --> 27:15.430]  when Mark Emery was kind of doing his thing
[27:15.430 --> 27:18.030]  and there was a lot of short blueberry around, man.
[27:18.030 --> 27:20.230]  And when you hit that thing, man, you better hold on, man.
[27:20.230 --> 27:21.990]  I think it would just kind of get you all like,
[27:21.990 --> 27:22.950]  well, reset.
[27:22.950 --> 27:24.390]  So very excited.
[27:25.290 --> 27:26.750]  We reached out to Sam to grow off
[27:26.750 --> 27:29.790]  because we're just trying to get people connected here,
[27:29.790 --> 27:32.590]  empowered, working with policymakers,
[27:32.590 --> 27:34.710]  getting the growers out of the closet to recognize that,
[27:34.710 --> 27:36.710]  hey, if we don't do something here,
[27:36.710 --> 27:37.950]  we're gonna run into a lot of problems
[27:37.950 --> 27:40.190]  other states are having where their big business
[27:40.190 --> 27:42.110]  is gonna take over and control our growth sites
[27:42.110 --> 27:42.950]  and stuff like that.
[27:42.950 --> 27:44.150]  So we're moving pretty fast here.
[27:44.150 --> 27:46.030]  And I think we're doing a good job.
[27:46.030 --> 27:47.950]  We're lobbying, you know what I mean?
[27:47.950 --> 27:48.790]  That's what we're doing.
[27:48.790 --> 27:50.670]  And we're trying to open up thousands
[27:50.670 --> 27:54.270]  of local based cooperatives,
[27:54.270 --> 27:56.790]  rosin makers, everything around here.
[27:56.790 --> 27:58.350]  And we're just following Maine.
[27:58.350 --> 27:59.550]  That's what we're trying to do right now.
[27:59.550 --> 28:02.110]  So I'm trying to throw Maine on them as hard as we can.
[28:02.110 --> 28:03.950]  We have a medical program here.
[28:03.950 --> 28:05.310]  It's pretty much a failure.
[28:05.310 --> 28:07.590]  It was established in the year 2000.
[28:07.590 --> 28:08.430]  I don't know if you guys do,
[28:08.430 --> 28:11.390]  but Hawaii was the first place to pass medical cannabis
[28:11.390 --> 28:13.990]  and the last place to get dispensary 16 years later.
[28:13.990 --> 28:15.550]  So it's always been a conundrum.
[28:16.430 --> 28:18.630]  But yeah, so we met Sam and we just,
[28:18.630 --> 28:19.590]  I said, hey, well, let's just try
[28:19.590 --> 28:20.890]  and get a little grow off going here
[28:20.890 --> 28:22.990]  and see what we can do in Oahu.
[28:23.870 --> 28:24.910]  I'm not a breeder.
[28:24.910 --> 28:27.470]  I have bred many times before,
[28:27.470 --> 28:29.630]  but I would definitely not call myself a breeder.
[28:29.630 --> 28:31.150]  I'm definitely a grower.
[28:31.150 --> 28:33.590]  We have about a 20,000 square foot site here
[28:33.590 --> 28:35.550]  with like I said, 2000 patients.
[28:37.170 --> 28:40.230]  My grow off kind of plant and what we're going with
[28:40.230 --> 28:45.070]  was a humbling experience by meeting King Lancelot VIII,
[28:45.070 --> 28:48.990]  which was in the eighth generation of King Kamehameha
[28:48.990 --> 28:49.910]  that was still alive.
[28:49.910 --> 28:52.430]  And he passed away a couple of years ago from cancer
[28:52.870 --> 28:54.430]  and handed me some seeds.
[28:54.430 --> 28:55.590]  I can't tell you what they were
[28:55.590 --> 28:57.390]  cause then I'll give it away,
[28:57.390 --> 28:59.590]  but there was some special stuff in it.
[28:59.590 --> 29:01.470]  So we ran about a hundred seeds.
[29:01.470 --> 29:04.110]  We found some really cool old school stuff in it,
[29:04.110 --> 29:06.170]  some blueberry and some cheesy stuff.
[29:06.170 --> 29:07.750]  And so that's kind of what we're going with right now.
[29:07.750 --> 29:11.510]  We're gonna try and run those clones
[29:11.510 --> 29:14.550]  and then kind of like, and in memory of King Lancelot.
[29:14.550 --> 29:16.070]  So that's kind of how we're rolling with it.
[29:16.070 --> 29:17.710]  And we're really excited.
[29:17.710 --> 29:21.310]  It's definitely an old mercy and pining,
[29:21.310 --> 29:22.830]  old school strain for sure.
[29:22.830 --> 29:24.030]  There's something going on with it
[29:24.030 --> 29:26.730]  and I haven't smelt that smell in a long time.
[29:26.730 --> 29:28.270]  So that's kind of what we're up to
[29:28.270 --> 29:32.310]  and what we're excited about in a short story.
[29:33.750 --> 29:34.710]  I'm so excited.
[29:34.710 --> 29:38.550]  Jason's like so good at just driving community
[29:38.550 --> 29:42.030]  around just what he's doing and bringing growers in.
[29:42.030 --> 29:45.470]  And you're throwing a party during our clone drop, right?
[29:45.470 --> 29:46.510]  So that'll be fun.
[29:48.630 --> 29:49.470]  Yeah, we do.
[29:49.470 --> 29:52.110]  We try to run a couple of patient awareness days
[29:52.110 --> 29:53.590]  or patient appreciation days
[29:53.590 --> 29:55.950]  because the patients are what makes our site.
[29:55.950 --> 29:57.310]  It's just been insane, you guys,
[29:57.310 --> 29:59.390]  seeing people come through the gate and just saying,
[29:59.390 --> 30:01.550]  hey, we don't have access to medicine.
[30:01.550 --> 30:03.310]  And we're like, here you go.
[30:03.310 --> 30:06.110]  And now we've got a lot of great things on our side.
[30:06.110 --> 30:09.030]  We don't see crazy narcotics compliance checks.
[30:09.030 --> 30:09.870]  It's all gone now.
[30:09.870 --> 30:12.630]  So we've really found the right people, the right lawyers,
[30:12.630 --> 30:15.250]  the right lobbyists to really take control of this
[30:15.250 --> 30:16.910]  and start driving in the right direction.
[30:16.910 --> 30:18.910]  So people are not suffering.
[30:19.630 --> 30:23.550]  I'm sure a lot of you guys started like I did,
[30:23.550 --> 30:25.430]  just growing weed for our friends and having fun
[30:25.430 --> 30:27.950]  and really not understanding maybe in my opinion,
[30:27.950 --> 30:30.250]  the whole medicinal effect of cannabis.
[30:30.250 --> 30:32.390]  And now that you start seeing people coming through the gate
[30:32.390 --> 30:34.710]  that can't sleep at night and doing this and doing that
[30:34.710 --> 30:36.430]  and trying to find a remedy for them,
[30:36.430 --> 30:38.350]  it's totally transformed me as a person.
[30:38.350 --> 30:41.110]  And it's bad-ass.
[30:41.110 --> 30:42.390]  I mean, it's just exciting.
[30:42.390 --> 30:45.510]  And it gives you a lot of leverage to kind of go back
[30:45.510 --> 30:48.350]  to the people, the lobbyists in our state
[30:48.350 --> 30:50.470]  or the politicians in our state that are still stuck
[30:50.470 --> 30:52.550]  in the reefer madness world and just going,
[30:52.550 --> 30:54.670]  hey, you're looking at it all the wrong way.
[30:54.670 --> 30:55.910]  You got people suffering out here
[30:55.910 --> 30:57.910]  and you need to move quickly.
[30:57.910 --> 31:00.310]  And so, yeah, we do not on tangent, but we do.
[31:00.310 --> 31:04.710]  We did our first medical patient day about a month ago,
[31:04.710 --> 31:09.270]  had about 400 people and had some live local reggae stars
[31:09.270 --> 31:10.930]  and legal Geordie, some fun stuff.
[31:10.930 --> 31:13.870]  And it went, it was, you know how it is you guys,
[31:13.870 --> 31:15.550]  when you get these things together and they're safe
[31:15.550 --> 31:17.030]  and sound and people walking around with joints
[31:17.030 --> 31:20.990]  in their mouth and don't fear persecution.
[31:20.990 --> 31:22.550]  It's just, it's just iry.
[31:22.550 --> 31:24.310]  It's just so empowering.
[31:24.310 --> 31:25.210]  So it was really cool.
[31:25.210 --> 31:27.990]  So we're hoping to have this next one on another party,
[31:27.990 --> 31:31.350]  July 9th and hand out some clones
[31:31.350 --> 31:33.110]  and see what we can going on here.
[31:33.110 --> 31:36.470]  We got a shit load of growers in Hawaii, tons of them.
[31:36.470 --> 31:37.910]  They're all hiding out and starting
[31:37.910 --> 31:39.070]  to make their way forward.
[31:39.070 --> 31:43.110]  And we're actually even starting to kind of hooey up,
[31:43.110 --> 31:45.750]  kind of gang up with them to get their flower to our farm,
[31:45.750 --> 31:50.230]  to kind of showcase them and start branding them
[31:50.230 --> 31:51.150]  for the future.
[31:51.150 --> 31:52.390]  So when things kind of opened up,
[31:52.390 --> 31:54.870]  they already have a great name and they're well-known
[31:54.870 --> 31:58.030]  and they can make their living off this wonderful plant
[31:58.030 --> 31:59.230]  and still help people.
[31:59.230 --> 32:00.070]  So yeah.
[32:00.910 --> 32:03.950]  Well, since you're the last clone drop of the season,
[32:03.950 --> 32:06.750]  I would, I'll invite like everyone on the call.
[32:06.750 --> 32:08.510]  If you're participating in the grow off,
[32:08.510 --> 32:10.570]  like let's go to this party together.
[32:10.570 --> 32:11.410]  I'll be there.
[32:11.410 --> 32:14.070]  We'll hand out some clones and you've all earned it
[32:14.070 --> 32:15.590]  after all the hard work that you're putting
[32:15.590 --> 32:16.750]  into doing this for us.
[32:16.750 --> 32:18.590]  Like, please let's go and.
[32:18.590 --> 32:20.350]  Yeah. And you guys, you guys can pitch a tent.
[32:20.350 --> 32:21.470]  Don't even get a hotel room.
[32:21.470 --> 32:24.550]  Just come up and stay on the farm and kick it and have fun.
[32:24.550 --> 32:26.110]  And you guys are all welcome, man.
[32:26.110 --> 32:28.430]  It's really, you know, I'm very familiar
[32:28.430 --> 32:31.670]  with a lot of the breeders on this podcast right now
[32:31.670 --> 32:33.790]  and a lot of new ones and you guys see what's happening.
[32:33.790 --> 32:36.150]  You gotta have breeders you can trust
[32:36.150 --> 32:38.830]  that you can get clones and seeds from.
[32:38.830 --> 32:41.430]  The seed industry is just out of control.
[32:41.430 --> 32:43.350]  So it's nice that we're all starting to wrap up
[32:43.390 --> 32:44.790]  and kind of gain energy together.
[32:44.790 --> 32:48.230]  So we get legitimacy and saying, Hey, you know
[32:48.230 --> 32:49.470]  this is the real deal.
[32:49.470 --> 32:50.390]  I got it right here.
[32:50.390 --> 32:53.670]  You know, it's just like, whether it's a cut from Mendo
[32:53.670 --> 32:55.230]  or, you know, it's really exciting.
[32:55.230 --> 32:56.070]  You know what I mean?
[32:56.070 --> 32:56.890]  So we're, we're excited.
[32:56.890 --> 32:57.830]  And we love bringing genetics in.
[32:57.830 --> 32:59.710]  And there's definitely a lot of Hawaii genetics
[32:59.710 --> 33:02.310]  but as you guys know, cannabis didn't show up to Hawaii
[33:02.310 --> 33:04.230]  till like the late fifties, early sixties,
[33:04.230 --> 33:06.230]  surfers, Vietnam vets.
[33:06.230 --> 33:09.150]  So, you know, all the strains are from outside of Hawaii
[33:09.150 --> 33:10.670]  although they've been here for a little while.
[33:10.670 --> 33:12.670]  So there's still some hidden stuff around, you know
[33:13.190 --> 33:15.230]  and a lot of it lost as well.
[33:15.230 --> 33:17.310]  And you'll hear every story from someone here
[33:17.310 --> 33:18.310]  who grew as a kid.
[33:18.310 --> 33:22.190]  I mean, this place is just a cannabis kingdom.
[33:22.190 --> 33:24.670]  It's amazing to see like talk to people who are my age
[33:24.670 --> 33:27.590]  or older that were growing Durban hash plant
[33:27.590 --> 33:30.230]  and sugar cane fields in the sixties or seventies, you know
[33:30.230 --> 33:31.710]  and you're like, what was that all about?
[33:31.710 --> 33:33.230]  You know, and those seeds aren't around anymore
[33:33.230 --> 33:35.150]  but you kind of, kind of know probably
[33:35.150 --> 33:36.030]  what they were fooling with
[33:36.030 --> 33:37.590]  with some of the old legends in place
[33:37.590 --> 33:39.590]  and the creators of Durban poison
[33:39.590 --> 33:41.550]  and some of the Ghanis that were being smoked over here
[33:41.550 --> 33:43.830]  and closed for back in the day from some of the legends.
[33:43.830 --> 33:46.070]  So yeah, it's really exciting.
[33:48.630 --> 33:49.590]  Cool. All right.
[33:49.590 --> 33:51.910]  Well, hopefully some of you guys can come out and join us.
[33:51.910 --> 33:55.590]  And if not, we're actually doing for the first time ever
[33:55.590 --> 33:59.310]  all of the awards are going to be in Vegas on November 15th.
[33:59.310 --> 34:00.590]  That's like the first night
[34:00.590 --> 34:04.750]  of the big convention that we don't have to tag.
[34:06.670 --> 34:09.270]  So yeah, November 15th, we'll be announcing winners
[34:09.270 --> 34:12.990]  from all of these States at a private party in Vegas.
[34:12.990 --> 34:15.550]  If you're participating in the grow off, you have free entry
[34:15.550 --> 34:18.270]  all of these guys will hopefully be there.
[34:18.270 --> 34:21.030]  So that's, and then we'll also be live streaming it.
[34:21.030 --> 34:23.630]  Peter, maybe we'll do it on here so that folks can watch
[34:23.630 --> 34:26.350]  and see who won from all these awesome States.
[34:26.350 --> 34:29.270]  And someone had asked who can enter.
[34:29.270 --> 34:33.030]  And I made a point in the last two years
[34:33.030 --> 34:36.790]  to make sure we could open this up to home-grow caregivers
[34:36.790 --> 34:38.710]  not just commercial farms.
[34:39.150 --> 34:40.830]  We originally started, it was just commercial
[34:40.830 --> 34:42.590]  and then realized that, you know
[34:42.590 --> 34:44.870]  the home-grow caregiver market is huge.
[34:44.870 --> 34:47.670]  And a lot of them want employment in the industry.
[34:47.670 --> 34:50.030]  And so by going through a grow off
[34:50.030 --> 34:51.630]  and some of them don't, which is totally fine
[34:51.630 --> 34:53.630]  but they also grow fire weed.
[34:53.630 --> 34:57.670]  So we figured if we can get the home-grow market
[34:57.670 --> 35:00.550]  participating, they have a resume item if they win
[35:00.550 --> 35:03.870]  and then they can kind of move themselves up
[35:03.870 --> 35:05.150]  in the industry if they choose to
[35:05.150 --> 35:07.510]  but they're also their test scores are off the charts.
[35:07.510 --> 35:10.710]  So in, I think every single one of these States
[35:10.710 --> 35:13.270]  home-grow caregiver is open
[35:13.270 --> 35:15.790]  depending on metric transfer stuff
[35:15.790 --> 35:18.510]  commercial might not be available in your state.
[35:19.710 --> 35:21.950]  So yeah, Val, you should definitely enter
[35:21.950 --> 35:25.510]  because home-grow is available in all of the States
[35:25.510 --> 35:26.710]  that we're in this year.
[35:27.710 --> 35:30.470]  So what should we chat about boys?
[35:32.470 --> 35:33.950]  What questions, we had a question
[35:33.950 --> 35:37.470]  about how many males you go through before you choose one
[35:38.310 --> 35:39.150]  to breed with?
[35:39.150 --> 35:41.070]  And I know, there we go.
[35:41.070 --> 35:42.430]  Okay, thank you, Peter.
[35:44.150 --> 35:45.390]  Anyone want to chime in?
[35:46.590 --> 35:49.290]  Go through them till you find what you're looking for.
[35:50.390 --> 35:51.550]  How many do you have?
[35:53.550 --> 35:55.590]  You got a thousand, go through a thousand.
[35:55.590 --> 35:57.910]  All day, got the space and the time.
[35:57.910 --> 36:00.230]  You'll see it when you know, like that structure
[36:00.230 --> 36:04.270]  that stem rub, you know, they'll just the way the leaf
[36:04.270 --> 36:07.150]  complexion of the leaf, the waxiness of the plant.
[36:07.830 --> 36:09.590]  You can see like how, like the plant health overall
[36:09.590 --> 36:12.630]  based on how you're feeding it will really kind of dictate
[36:12.630 --> 36:14.470]  what sort of expressions you might be able to pull
[36:14.470 --> 36:15.310]  out of it too.
[36:15.310 --> 36:18.710]  So, and always, like, I always just try and make sure
[36:18.710 --> 36:20.310]  that people finish those males.
[36:20.310 --> 36:21.830]  Like, don't just wait until they drop
[36:21.830 --> 36:24.190]  but see what they do when they're done, you know
[36:25.430 --> 36:26.830]  but you don't have the space for it.
[36:26.830 --> 36:30.510]  And you can't get it, you know, can't get it segregated
[36:30.510 --> 36:31.350]  from any place.
[36:31.350 --> 36:32.790]  It shouldn't have seeds in it, obviously
[36:32.790 --> 36:34.150]  that's a little tough, but.
[36:34.990 --> 36:37.630]  Well, I think if you have the opportunity being able
[36:37.630 --> 36:40.270]  to see the male plant flower out to completion
[36:40.270 --> 36:44.270]  before you ever hit it to another girl
[36:44.270 --> 36:47.510]  who really is a really beneficial thing.
[36:47.510 --> 36:50.390]  There's a lot of things that you see during that process
[36:50.390 --> 36:51.910]  that you don't see otherwise.
[36:51.910 --> 36:54.950]  You don't see how the plant expresses,
[36:54.950 --> 36:59.750]  you don't see how the plant like really continues
[36:59.750 --> 37:03.670]  to stack flowers unless you really run that male completion.
[37:05.150 --> 37:09.510]  And I'm also a big firm believer of putting them on revege.
[37:09.510 --> 37:11.550]  So let them finish and revege them.
[37:11.550 --> 37:15.190]  And, you know, you'll find out a lot about them too
[37:15.190 --> 37:16.310]  and bring things.
[37:16.310 --> 37:19.110]  And a lot of it comes down to looking at the progeny
[37:19.110 --> 37:21.230]  and like what came out of that, you know,
[37:21.230 --> 37:22.990]  cause like with the Magnum Opus breed.
[37:22.990 --> 37:25.190]  So one of the Magnum really pulled through
[37:25.190 --> 37:26.390]  every one of the crosses.
[37:26.390 --> 37:29.750]  There wasn't one real dominant female out of that group
[37:29.750 --> 37:33.150]  until I selected further for a male
[37:33.150 --> 37:34.790]  that would actually pass those traits.
[37:34.790 --> 37:38.550]  So that really kind of, you know, time, effort
[37:38.550 --> 37:42.110]  and your dedication to what you're really looking for.
[37:42.110 --> 37:44.390]  Well, that's the thing, none of us can read the future.
[37:44.390 --> 37:47.350]  And so like, if you don't watch the progeny
[37:47.350 --> 37:49.470]  and you don't see which traits are dominant,
[37:49.470 --> 37:52.150]  then you have no idea like what you were moving with
[37:52.150 --> 37:53.230]  in the first place.
[37:53.230 --> 37:54.830]  It's a mystery pundit, you know,
[37:54.830 --> 37:57.150]  it's like there's so many different areas you could go,
[37:57.150 --> 37:59.590]  especially with the polys and the hybrids out there,
[37:59.590 --> 38:02.310]  just there's so much variation and recessive dominance,
[38:02.310 --> 38:05.470]  especially once you start talking about female generations
[38:05.470 --> 38:07.190]  and moving further into the line.
[38:08.070 --> 38:09.870]  I would definitely stress test as well
[38:09.870 --> 38:11.990]  for certain strains, like if it's a sneeze,
[38:11.990 --> 38:14.990]  I would want to harm, like the smallest amount of stress
[38:14.990 --> 38:17.430]  will cause it to harm and then you pretty much
[38:17.430 --> 38:19.910]  promote that into the progeny, into the next generation.
[38:19.910 --> 38:22.110]  So that's something that I want to promote
[38:22.110 --> 38:24.230]  into the next generation seed.
[38:24.230 --> 38:26.230]  So definitely stress test them more as well too,
[38:26.230 --> 38:28.430]  like treat them like shit, absolute garbage.
[38:28.550 --> 38:30.390]  Well, to me that is testing, you know,
[38:30.390 --> 38:32.030]  testing is treating them like shit
[38:32.030 --> 38:33.350]  and seeing what they can do with,
[38:33.350 --> 38:35.430]  because at the end of the day, you know,
[38:35.430 --> 38:37.270]  like you can be the best grower in the world
[38:37.270 --> 38:39.430]  and get my seeds or you can be the worst grower in the world
[38:39.430 --> 38:41.750]  and get my seeds and I'm not going to know what you are.
[38:41.750 --> 38:43.470]  I'm just going to sell you the pack of seeds
[38:43.470 --> 38:45.190]  and then we're going to find out afterwards
[38:45.190 --> 38:46.470]  when you do your stress test.
[38:46.470 --> 38:47.470]  Yeah.
[38:48.470 --> 38:50.910]  And not everyone's been styled in either, you know,
[38:50.910 --> 38:52.790]  you got to kind of play to the environment
[38:52.790 --> 38:55.510]  and actually like, you know, look a little bit deeper
[38:55.510 --> 38:56.830]  than you're used to, you know,
[38:57.310 --> 38:59.870]  look a little bit deeper than just how the plant reacted
[38:59.870 --> 39:03.030]  and maybe take a look at what you did to that plant
[39:03.030 --> 39:04.910]  through that situation.
[39:04.910 --> 39:06.710]  Like, I'm not always, look,
[39:06.710 --> 39:08.790]  I feel like a lot of times people come up with excuses
[39:08.790 --> 39:10.710]  for the plant or why it didn't work for them
[39:10.710 --> 39:12.550]  where they might be needing to look at
[39:12.550 --> 39:15.790]  why you didn't work for the plant, you know?
[39:15.790 --> 39:18.990]  And don't be afraid to throw stuff away too, right?
[39:18.990 --> 39:23.150]  Throw stuff away, you know, don't hang on to everything.
[39:23.150 --> 39:25.790]  You know, a lot of it, you know, it isn't special.
[39:25.790 --> 39:28.070]  But they all are special, you hang on to them,
[39:28.070 --> 39:31.470]  but don't get attached to them, you know, if they're not.
[39:31.470 --> 39:35.390]  If it's not no game changing, like terpene profile
[39:35.390 --> 39:37.230]  or like yield or anything else like that,
[39:37.230 --> 39:39.110]  then it's probably not worth keeping around.
[39:39.110 --> 39:41.550]  You only want the stuff that's like, my own.
[39:41.550 --> 39:42.670]  It's got to do all the things.
[39:42.670 --> 39:44.550]  It's got to veg well, it's got to clone well,
[39:44.550 --> 39:45.710]  it's got to flower well,
[39:45.710 --> 39:48.030]  it's got to give bad-ass bag appeal,
[39:48.030 --> 39:50.750]  it's got to smell good, it's got to get you higher than shit.
[39:50.750 --> 39:51.950]  It's got to do it all.
[39:51.950 --> 39:53.630]  Sometimes you're probably that,
[39:53.630 --> 39:55.310]  and that doesn't mean that it's always going to win,
[39:55.350 --> 39:56.390]  but a lot of the terpene strains like Giggles
[39:56.390 --> 39:58.750]  can take three weeks to almost a month to root.
[39:58.750 --> 40:01.830]  It grow like absolute bullshit, and it's hard to grow.
[40:01.830 --> 40:04.630]  But the terpene profile is what makes it stick around.
[40:04.630 --> 40:08.630]  Noah's Terpene has won more awards than Zeal did in one year
[40:08.630 --> 40:10.390]  just based off of the terpene profile.
[40:10.390 --> 40:13.110]  It's a slope, it's pretty much like very hard to grow,
[40:13.110 --> 40:16.470]  but not everything should be a commercially viable strain
[40:16.470 --> 40:17.390]  for it to stick around,
[40:17.390 --> 40:19.030]  because a lot of the other strains
[40:19.030 --> 40:21.230]  that aren't commercially viable, the rest is a liar.
[40:21.230 --> 40:23.150]  You've got to earn those terps.
[40:23.150 --> 40:26.230]  Hey guys, back to males and females.
[40:26.230 --> 40:31.110]  I'm right at the beginning to know what you're looking for.
[40:31.110 --> 40:34.350]  If you don't know what you want, what you want to question,
[40:34.350 --> 40:36.990]  what you're looking for, you're just looking to,
[40:36.990 --> 40:39.550]  well, just choose the one that maybe impresses you,
[40:39.550 --> 40:40.710]  the best one of the bunch.
[40:40.710 --> 40:42.750]  But if you know what you're looking for,
[40:45.150 --> 40:48.470]  you know what to pick.
[40:48.470 --> 40:52.910]  We use a method where we grade every single plant.
[40:53.670 --> 40:55.510]  We give it a one to 10 score.
[40:55.510 --> 40:58.310]  We do it sometimes every two days.
[40:58.310 --> 41:01.470]  We'll give a score on its stock smell, on its leaf smell,
[41:01.470 --> 41:05.670]  its resin production, its load spacing, vigor and size,
[41:05.670 --> 41:09.750]  its resin smell, its flower size, compactness,
[41:09.750 --> 41:12.830]  all of the different characteristics of the plant
[41:12.830 --> 41:14.030]  throughout its flower.
[41:14.030 --> 41:17.110]  Every two days, we'll give it a grade.
[41:17.110 --> 41:19.950]  By the end of the flower,
[41:19.950 --> 41:24.390]  you've got an average of 15 different gradings for each plant.
[41:24.390 --> 41:26.310]  You average out all those grades,
[41:26.310 --> 41:29.750]  and it's a no-brainer that the top one sticks out
[41:29.750 --> 41:32.270]  guaranteed every single time
[41:32.270 --> 41:34.950]  because you rated it maybe a dozen times,
[41:34.950 --> 41:37.750]  and it gets a nine or a 10 every time for smell,
[41:37.750 --> 41:42.030]  and it gets a seven or eight for resin,
[41:42.030 --> 41:43.390]  whatever you're looking for.
[41:43.390 --> 41:47.230]  And it's an easy to put in a graph,
[41:47.230 --> 41:49.670]  mark down what's for,
[41:49.670 --> 41:55.070]  and you can find it, dial it in, and that way we will.
[41:57.870 --> 41:59.950]  I'd like to add to that too,
[41:59.950 --> 42:02.830]  to be careful if you're a grower and want to become a breeder.
[42:02.830 --> 42:05.750]  Here's your people right here giving you a warning, man.
[42:05.750 --> 42:07.750]  Breeding is no joke.
[42:07.750 --> 42:09.230]  And you want to reach out to the breeders.
[42:09.230 --> 42:11.750]  If you're a grower, you want to get your stuff from the breeders.
[42:11.750 --> 42:13.190]  You don't want to be a breeder grower
[42:13.190 --> 42:15.670]  and kind of pull that off because that is a lot of work,
[42:15.670 --> 42:16.830]  and that's what we love.
[42:16.830 --> 42:18.510]  I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.
[42:18.510 --> 42:19.750]  I'm reaching out to the breeders.
[42:19.750 --> 42:21.550]  That's what they specialize in.
[42:21.550 --> 42:23.630]  That's what they're taking all the meticulous notes
[42:23.630 --> 42:25.710]  and trying to find all the great crosses,
[42:25.710 --> 42:29.550]  and you will save yourself a lot of time and frustration
[42:29.550 --> 42:32.390]  just reaching out to your badass breeders for sure.
[42:32.390 --> 42:35.110]  100%.
[42:35.110 --> 42:36.670]  I mean, once you breed it,
[42:36.670 --> 42:39.070]  you're still looking at like a good six months or a year
[42:39.070 --> 42:41.030]  before you even really get a good look at it.
[42:41.030 --> 42:45.270]  So, you know, it's time and dedication right there.
[42:45.550 --> 42:49.590]  It's a long process and a lot of heartache.
[42:49.590 --> 42:52.550]  Throwing a lot of crazy shit late.
[42:52.550 --> 42:53.590]  Yeah.
[42:53.590 --> 42:54.790]  And trying to save a lot of time.
[42:54.790 --> 42:56.950]  If people knew what we got rid of,
[42:56.950 --> 42:59.830]  they'd probably keel over in the chair, you know?
[42:59.830 --> 43:01.430]  Oh, no, man.
[43:01.430 --> 43:04.510]  I just got done doing this 700-seat hunt, man,
[43:04.510 --> 43:06.750]  and I'm still having trouble trying to find
[43:06.750 --> 43:10.270]  which ones I need to trash.
[43:10.270 --> 43:11.550]  You know, it is, you know.
[43:11.550 --> 43:14.350]  We built the Ferrari, so now it's time to drive this thing
[43:14.350 --> 43:17.430]  and start making the hard choices.
[43:17.430 --> 43:20.190]  When you go for that, you can pretty much almost guarantee
[43:20.190 --> 43:22.550]  that whatever you select is going to defy,
[43:22.550 --> 43:23.790]  like almost game change.
[43:23.790 --> 43:27.430]  And so when people are doing female hunts like that large,
[43:27.430 --> 43:29.190]  I tell them, like, keep the number on it
[43:29.190 --> 43:31.870]  because straight up, it's GG for Y503,
[43:31.870 --> 43:34.150]  like just different, like Bruce Banner III.
[43:34.150 --> 43:35.190]  The number definitely does help.
[43:35.190 --> 43:37.870]  If people see it and you say,
[43:37.870 --> 43:40.630]  well, this is Magnum Opus number 456,
[43:40.630 --> 43:42.670]  they're gonna be like, well, that's the best clone
[43:42.710 --> 43:44.630]  out of anyone that anybody could possibly find
[43:44.630 --> 43:46.870]  because they went from that many seats.
[43:46.870 --> 43:49.910]  If you have a hunt, man, you're gonna come up with a PF.
[43:49.910 --> 43:50.750]  I'll bet.
[43:52.190 --> 43:56.390]  Only takes one, but you got a lot to go through to get there.
[43:56.390 --> 44:00.430]  And then the process of running back said
[44:00.430 --> 44:02.190]  once that you want to keep, you know,
[44:02.190 --> 44:05.870]  and that's another year running back two to three times
[44:05.870 --> 44:08.150]  to know what you're really working with, you know?
[44:08.150 --> 44:10.470]  So here's a question that I've always had
[44:10.470 --> 44:11.990]  and wanted to ask some of the readers,
[44:11.990 --> 44:16.310]  but do you guys find that you find your better expressions
[44:16.310 --> 44:18.830]  or truer expressions through your feeds
[44:18.830 --> 44:20.910]  or it's from your clone testing?
[44:23.750 --> 44:24.590]  Anybody?
[44:26.270 --> 44:28.630]  I feel like seed run is always the best run,
[44:28.630 --> 44:30.710]  but I feel like you get the honest expression
[44:30.710 --> 44:32.670]  when you're on your second, third runs.
[44:33.590 --> 44:35.030]  Yeah, see, that's where I've been at.
[44:35.030 --> 44:37.230]  So I've been kind of just trying to stay away
[44:37.230 --> 44:39.270]  from my actual seed hunts
[44:39.270 --> 44:41.750]  and actually do my first clone hunts
[44:42.510 --> 44:44.070]  as like the baseline for acclimation.
[44:44.070 --> 44:46.070]  Well, that's what you're gonna get in the commercial garden.
[44:46.070 --> 44:48.430]  You're never going to run that seed run again.
[44:48.430 --> 44:50.150]  You know, you only get one shot at it.
[44:50.150 --> 44:51.790]  So like, if you don't have something
[44:51.790 --> 44:53.510]  that does good in the clone generation,
[44:53.510 --> 44:55.230]  then you're screwed afterwards.
[44:55.230 --> 44:56.070]  Exactly.
[44:56.070 --> 44:58.750]  And I've actually been taking clones
[44:58.750 --> 45:02.110]  off of said seed plant and running that first.
[45:02.110 --> 45:04.390]  Yeah, that's kind of what I've been finding
[45:04.390 --> 45:06.750]  that's worked really well for me.
[45:06.750 --> 45:07.590]  Yeah, yeah.
[45:08.590 --> 45:11.350]  My nightmare is keeping like 700 clones.
[45:11.350 --> 45:12.750]  I'll make sure that I-
[45:12.750 --> 45:15.310]  Dude, that's what's happening to me.
[45:15.310 --> 45:17.310]  You can't keep 700 clones.
[45:17.310 --> 45:20.590]  If they don't veg, you shouldn't be keeping those.
[45:20.590 --> 45:23.750]  If they're not in the, like if you're phenom on,
[45:23.750 --> 45:26.030]  you got something that isn't vegging worth shit
[45:26.030 --> 45:26.950]  and it needs to go.
[45:26.950 --> 45:28.550]  You need to cull that shit right there.
[45:28.550 --> 45:29.390]  Oh, hell yeah.
[45:29.390 --> 45:31.670]  Because at the end of the day, it's too many.
[45:31.670 --> 45:32.950]  Yeah, I think he was just saying,
[45:32.950 --> 45:35.950]  I'm holding all those clones back as the process goes.
[45:36.390 --> 45:38.550]  So now in this day and age,
[45:38.550 --> 45:40.950]  like we've got our tissue culture lab set up.
[45:40.950 --> 45:42.710]  So I can just tissue culture everything
[45:42.710 --> 45:45.550]  and it takes up zero floor space for me.
[45:45.550 --> 45:46.950]  And then I can just eliminate them
[45:46.950 --> 45:48.790]  out of the refrigerators as we go.
[45:50.270 --> 45:52.750]  I kind of need a little bit of a micro propagation.
[45:52.750 --> 45:55.310]  Like this much space, like 700 for you.
[45:56.710 --> 45:57.870]  That's the average.
[45:57.870 --> 45:58.710]  Yeah.
[45:58.710 --> 46:01.030]  That would be pretty cool.
[46:01.030 --> 46:02.830]  I just gotta fucking say I love you.
[46:02.830 --> 46:04.150]  Oh, hell yeah.
[46:04.270 --> 46:06.870]  We try it when we go to the bar.
[46:06.870 --> 46:08.470]  I love you so much.
[46:08.470 --> 46:09.390]  I love you.
[46:09.390 --> 46:10.230]  I love you.
[46:10.230 --> 46:12.790]  Got a bunch of dental crosses available now.
[46:12.790 --> 46:14.950]  Or we sell 10 seeds in a pack.
[46:14.950 --> 46:17.110]  That's all I ever do a hundred.
[46:17.110 --> 46:20.670]  So like for the grow up, I mean, 10 seed packs,
[46:20.670 --> 46:22.230]  sprout 10 seeds.
[46:22.230 --> 46:24.430]  You gotta invest in the genetics.
[46:24.430 --> 46:26.190]  I said, a lot of people come,
[46:26.190 --> 46:28.630]  they think they're investing in us.
[46:28.630 --> 46:30.950]  I might have to go ahead now in a few.
[46:30.950 --> 46:32.630]  Probably gonna be like 10 minutes.
[46:32.670 --> 46:33.870]  5,000.
[46:33.870 --> 46:36.030]  You know, sometimes you should gotta trust
[46:36.030 --> 46:38.630]  if you're selling someone a six pack of seeds.
[46:43.630 --> 46:44.470]  5,000.
[46:44.470 --> 46:45.310]  Attack.
[46:45.310 --> 46:46.910]  You know, sometimes you gotta trust
[46:46.910 --> 46:49.590]  if you're selling someone a six pack of seeds.
[46:54.470 --> 46:55.310]  Absolutely.
[46:55.310 --> 46:57.310]  A hundred percent trust in the genetics
[46:57.310 --> 46:58.950]  with a six pack of seeds.
[46:58.950 --> 47:02.230]  They're gonna come up with something that's top, top quality.
[47:02.790 --> 47:03.630]  Hands down.
[47:03.630 --> 47:07.390]  When we bought 700 seeds, that was 50 different strains.
[47:08.670 --> 47:09.510]  Yes.
[47:09.510 --> 47:10.790]  You have one strain, you know, I mean,
[47:10.790 --> 47:13.590]  at 10 seeds, you know, if it's a quality cross
[47:13.590 --> 47:15.230]  and quality genetics,
[47:15.230 --> 47:17.830]  you really shouldn't have to go through that many
[47:17.830 --> 47:21.510]  to get a really, really, really top, top notch.
[47:21.510 --> 47:23.470]  No, I say that, but you know,
[47:23.470 --> 47:26.830]  I do like three, four, five packs of some people's gear
[47:26.830 --> 47:28.670]  just to find like that one.
[47:28.670 --> 47:30.230]  And they do exist.
[47:30.390 --> 47:32.710]  You're gonna find, you know, out of every pack,
[47:32.710 --> 47:34.030]  you're gonna find a good expression
[47:34.030 --> 47:36.350]  out of like 50, 50 parents,
[47:36.350 --> 47:39.230]  maybe some of the mother dominants,
[47:39.230 --> 47:41.110]  or maybe some of the males dominants.
[47:41.110 --> 47:43.230]  But it really does, you know,
[47:43.230 --> 47:46.550]  we can sit here and say that you can find fire in 10 pack,
[47:46.550 --> 47:49.990]  but to find one that's gonna hit all expression,
[47:49.990 --> 47:53.470]  whether it's nose, look, bag appeal,
[47:53.470 --> 47:55.750]  smell, taste, growth rates, veg,
[47:55.750 --> 47:57.910]  like that's gonna take a little bit more digging
[47:57.910 --> 47:59.030]  than just one pack.
[47:59.070 --> 48:01.510]  I don't care whose pack of seeds I'm going through.
[48:01.510 --> 48:02.470]  It takes a while.
[48:02.470 --> 48:05.710]  And you know, when they go through 1,700 seeds,
[48:05.710 --> 48:08.230]  you guarantee you found a good one.
[48:08.230 --> 48:09.150]  Oh, hell yeah.
[48:09.150 --> 48:13.030]  Well, when I've done 1,000 seed plants in the past,
[48:13.030 --> 48:17.350]  I found like 10 expressions of 10 things, you know,
[48:17.350 --> 48:19.790]  like, so there would be one phenotype
[48:19.790 --> 48:22.870]  or one expression that I would see, you know,
[48:22.870 --> 48:26.230]  20 times, 100 times, 50 times, whatever.
[48:26.230 --> 48:28.630]  But it would be like six or seven different things
[48:29.270 --> 48:30.830]  that I would see across the whole 1,000.
[48:30.830 --> 48:32.750]  And then it was really just about picking out
[48:32.750 --> 48:34.110]  of those six and seven things,
[48:34.110 --> 48:36.190]  which is the winner of the six and seven.
[48:37.550 --> 48:39.990]  I think the point is that you're gonna find bomb seeds
[48:39.990 --> 48:42.190]  from a great breeder.
[48:42.190 --> 48:44.630]  We can go back as early as Reserva Provada
[48:44.630 --> 48:46.790]  and Skywalker O'Geeves and stuff.
[48:46.790 --> 48:47.630]  That's our-
[48:47.630 --> 48:48.550]  And you get a 10 pack of that, man,
[48:48.550 --> 48:51.190]  it's just like, oh shit, this is crazy.
[48:51.190 --> 48:52.030]  You know what I mean?
[48:52.030 --> 48:52.870]  Just game changers.
[48:52.870 --> 48:54.630]  So it was super fun.
[48:54.630 --> 48:56.430]  Those Reserva packs, you had six seeds
[48:56.430 --> 48:58.350]  and every one of them was the same.
[48:59.030 --> 49:00.470]  There was some homage in those packs,
[49:00.470 --> 49:01.870]  like the early stuff.
[49:01.870 --> 49:04.070]  Like you go by the, you know, I don't know.
[49:04.070 --> 49:05.670]  I don't wanna say nothing, but.
[49:05.670 --> 49:08.630]  It ain't what it used to be.
[49:08.630 --> 49:10.870]  Bob, I just wanna say real quick.
[49:10.870 --> 49:12.750]  What's messed up is that back in the day,
[49:12.750 --> 49:14.590]  people used to actually really breed,
[49:15.590 --> 49:17.830]  really breed specific strains, go into the world,
[49:17.830 --> 49:20.550]  go to like F4, BX5, whatever.
[49:20.550 --> 49:22.550]  Now it just seems because the end user's demand
[49:22.550 --> 49:23.910]  is changing so much.
[49:23.910 --> 49:26.070]  If it doesn't look good on Instagram,
[49:26.070 --> 49:27.310]  if it doesn't look good on Instagram,
[49:27.310 --> 49:28.150]  then they don't want it.
[49:28.990 --> 49:29.830]  And it's like most people,
[49:29.830 --> 49:31.710]  there's almost no one gonna take certain select,
[49:31.710 --> 49:33.230]  BX5 or something like that
[49:33.230 --> 49:34.830]  because people's demand keeps changing.
[49:34.830 --> 49:39.630]  Instagram keeps making everybody's demand change so fast
[49:39.630 --> 49:41.190]  by the time you work with specific strain,
[49:41.190 --> 49:42.390]  it's not even popular anymore.
[49:42.390 --> 49:44.830]  But once it's time to get around to some people,
[49:44.830 --> 49:46.030]  breed specific strains.
[49:46.030 --> 49:47.790]  That's like short term thinking though.
[49:47.790 --> 49:49.590]  That's like short term thinking, right?
[49:49.590 --> 49:50.430]  To follow up.
[49:50.430 --> 49:51.270]  Oh, for sure.
[49:51.270 --> 49:52.990]  And it's really funny.
[49:52.990 --> 49:56.590]  Instagram is only the visual component of ganja
[49:56.630 --> 49:58.870]  and you can smell it and you can smoke it
[49:58.870 --> 49:59.870]  and it changes you.
[49:59.870 --> 50:02.790]  So you gotta have like, I don't know,
[50:02.790 --> 50:04.270]  breeders just have to,
[50:04.270 --> 50:05.990]  you have to be partly crazy
[50:05.990 --> 50:07.790]  because you have to know that you're going on this
[50:07.790 --> 50:11.550]  like 10 year journey to be an old ass man
[50:11.550 --> 50:13.870]  by the time you get to whatever you're creating.
[50:13.870 --> 50:16.110]  And so, yeah, just,
[50:16.110 --> 50:19.110]  it all depends on what you're trying to create.
[50:19.110 --> 50:21.870]  Because then it tells you if you need a million males
[50:21.870 --> 50:25.870]  or a hundred females or you're doing acres
[50:25.910 --> 50:27.510]  or whatever you're looking for.
[50:27.510 --> 50:30.550]  Cause sometimes you're looking for that really rare thing.
[50:30.550 --> 50:33.230]  Sometimes you're trying to prove your consistency.
[50:33.230 --> 50:35.150]  Yeah, I like the 10 pack.
[50:35.150 --> 50:37.590]  That's a pretty fair way to look at it though.
[50:37.590 --> 50:39.310]  I don't see how rare,
[50:39.310 --> 50:41.470]  I don't see how many red trips we're gonna find
[50:41.470 --> 50:44.230]  to keep the cross gelato back to gelato without.
[50:44.230 --> 50:47.630]  I don't know, I don't know where everything is.
[50:47.630 --> 50:49.870]  What, the breeder shortcuts, you know?
[50:49.870 --> 50:52.350]  Cause gelato is smart.
[50:52.350 --> 50:53.910]  Well, I mean, that's the thing though.
[50:53.910 --> 50:56.950]  It's like, as Caesar pointed out, Instagram thing.
[50:58.150 --> 51:01.390]  We look at what the consumer is trying to really get
[51:01.390 --> 51:04.830]  these days, they want that gelato times gelato times gelato
[51:04.830 --> 51:08.230]  times gelato times cookies for whatever reason
[51:08.230 --> 51:09.550]  that's what they want.
[51:09.550 --> 51:10.590]  But at the end of the day,
[51:10.590 --> 51:14.270]  the people that are on this call are generally not interested
[51:14.270 --> 51:16.510]  in gelato times gelato, you know?
[51:17.950 --> 51:20.710]  Don't forget about 50% PhD too.
[51:20.830 --> 51:25.830]  Yeah, when it's 40% turps and 50% PhD.
[51:26.350 --> 51:27.190]  It does happen.
[51:34.350 --> 51:36.510]  I think that's a pretty cool breeder too
[51:36.510 --> 51:38.630]  is when you get that pack and there isn't homogeny,
[51:38.630 --> 51:39.750]  they know it's been done right.
[51:39.750 --> 51:41.750]  Yeah, just know, hey man,
[51:41.750 --> 51:44.110]  if I'm gonna ban or pack and I'm getting this,
[51:44.110 --> 51:45.950]  I know I'm gonna get something right in this joint.
[51:45.950 --> 51:46.790]  You know what I mean?
[51:46.790 --> 51:48.550]  And that's what, you know, people are watching this,
[51:48.550 --> 51:50.270]  be careful who you're working with
[51:50.830 --> 51:53.430]  and I just like to see the markets wide open right now.
[51:53.430 --> 51:54.910]  And I think this is the most important part
[51:54.910 --> 51:56.390]  of bringing the breeders together to go,
[51:56.390 --> 52:00.230]  hey, who's doing what and who's putting the time in
[52:00.230 --> 52:05.230]  so they get paid properly and announced properly.
[52:06.510 --> 52:07.350]  You know what I mean?
[52:07.350 --> 52:08.190]  That's really important.
[52:08.190 --> 52:09.030]  My work for sure.
[52:09.030 --> 52:11.510]  Really is the killer.
[52:11.510 --> 52:13.750]  No more like,
[52:13.750 --> 52:18.470]  I mean, it's a special year.
[52:19.470 --> 52:22.270]  You know, and to get purple to breed in,
[52:22.270 --> 52:26.030]  and the reds, we just came out with a brand new red flower.
[52:32.710 --> 52:36.110]  It's a lot of time and a lot of hard work.
[52:38.070 --> 52:38.910]  100%.
[52:40.590 --> 52:42.550]  Yeah, we are all crazy.
[52:43.070 --> 52:43.910]  Yeah.
[52:46.630 --> 52:50.190]  And we're also holders and protectors of the seeds
[52:50.190 --> 52:51.470]  that we all have to have.
[52:51.470 --> 52:54.150]  I mean, we have like minds here.
[53:02.510 --> 53:03.590]  Thank you guys.
[53:03.590 --> 53:06.470]  I mean, this was a feat to bring you all together.
[53:06.470 --> 53:08.670]  I appreciate you for doing it.
[53:08.670 --> 53:10.670]  I'm here, I don't know,
[53:10.710 --> 53:12.630]  like, are we cutting this at four?
[53:12.630 --> 53:14.030]  Do we want to keep going?
[53:14.030 --> 53:14.870]  Do you guys have a problem?
[53:14.870 --> 53:18.030]  Hey, so I actually got to bounce my AC guys
[53:18.030 --> 53:19.630]  there to put in some new ACs.
[53:19.630 --> 53:23.230]  So I got a debt, but I appreciate this.
[53:23.230 --> 53:24.070]  This is awesome.
[53:24.070 --> 53:27.030]  I'm excited to see what goes on in every state.
[53:27.030 --> 53:29.150]  And we should definitely all think about
[53:31.390 --> 53:32.950]  what we can do together.
[53:32.950 --> 53:34.190]  The swap or, you know,
[53:34.190 --> 53:36.430]  make some shit for next year's grow offs
[53:36.430 --> 53:39.230]  and the next year's grow offs after that.
[53:39.230 --> 53:40.470]  I think that would be really cool.
[53:41.310 --> 53:42.150]  Looking well.
[53:42.150 --> 53:42.990]  Looking well.
[53:42.990 --> 53:45.430]  And tank connect 100%.
[53:45.430 --> 53:47.270]  This is awesome.
[53:47.270 --> 53:50.070]  It's so much more organic and so much better
[53:50.070 --> 53:52.910]  than like a high times or any of that shit, you know,
[53:52.910 --> 53:55.470]  like I can't wait to see where this actually goes
[53:55.470 --> 53:57.270]  in the next five, 10 years, right?
[53:57.270 --> 54:00.070]  And to be clear, I want to work with all of you guys.
[54:00.070 --> 54:02.990]  So, you know, if the possibility is there,
[54:02.990 --> 54:05.230]  hit me up, I want to do this.
[54:05.230 --> 54:07.510]  Let's have some community mentors.
[54:07.510 --> 54:08.550]  Let's see what we can do.
[54:08.910 --> 54:11.190]  I say, we're better.
[54:11.190 --> 54:13.430]  Teamwork makes the dream work, baby.
[54:13.430 --> 54:14.750]  This is amazing.
[54:14.750 --> 54:16.550]  Jack Jones, you're up there.
[54:16.550 --> 54:17.390]  Yeah.
[54:17.390 --> 54:19.910]  Big kickbacks on that call.
[54:19.910 --> 54:22.870]  Make way for some women on this call.
[54:22.870 --> 54:24.350]  Sam, make sure.
[54:24.350 --> 54:26.070]  Yes, please.
[54:26.070 --> 54:26.910]  Reach out.
[54:26.910 --> 54:28.750]  Make room for the women on this call.
[54:28.750 --> 54:30.430]  Reach out to Sam.
[54:30.430 --> 54:31.270]  Me too.
[54:31.270 --> 54:32.750]  We got some big guys, faces up here.
[54:32.750 --> 54:34.150]  We're just being real.
[54:35.150 --> 54:37.230]  And that being said too,
[54:37.230 --> 54:40.510]  like our entry fee this year is 50 bucks.
[54:40.510 --> 54:42.310]  It used to be hundreds of dollars.
[54:42.310 --> 54:44.430]  And we just said, let's get as many growers
[54:44.430 --> 54:45.670]  as we possibly can.
[54:45.670 --> 54:49.310]  And I will see you more frequently.
[54:49.310 --> 54:50.150]  Bye, Ross.
[54:50.150 --> 54:50.990]  Thank you.
[54:50.990 --> 54:52.270]  I appreciate it all y'all.
[54:52.270 --> 54:53.110]  Have a good one.
[54:53.110 --> 54:54.150]  Let's all get in touch.
[54:55.030 --> 54:55.870]  You got it, man.
[54:55.870 --> 54:56.710]  Have a great day.
[54:56.710 --> 54:57.990]  You too.
[54:57.990 --> 54:59.310]  Yeah, I mean, we need to hop up too.
[54:59.310 --> 55:00.790]  That's cool.
[55:00.790 --> 55:02.230]  I just want to let everyone watch.
[55:02.230 --> 55:03.550]  We gotta go, bye.
[55:03.830 --> 55:05.070]  Bye, everybody.
[55:07.070 --> 55:07.910]  All right, cool.
[55:07.910 --> 55:10.110]  Peter, join me for the end of this.
[55:10.110 --> 55:15.110]  There's a baby on the call now, Peter.
[55:15.150 --> 55:16.750]  We get to see your smiling face.
[55:16.750 --> 55:18.710]  What's up, Peter?
[55:18.710 --> 55:20.150]  All right, yeah.
[55:20.150 --> 55:21.750]  I was just trying to say, like you said,
[55:21.750 --> 55:24.550]  we don't have any female genetic partners on the call.
[55:24.550 --> 55:25.550]  I want to see them.
[55:25.550 --> 55:28.150]  I want to see more women wearing our wrestling belts
[55:28.150 --> 55:29.870]  for your championship.
[55:29.870 --> 55:31.470]  We do a social equity grant.
[55:31.510 --> 55:35.190]  We're looking for more BIPOC women-owned veteran,
[55:35.190 --> 55:37.470]  previous incarceration entries,
[55:37.470 --> 55:40.190]  get 50% off a $50 entry fee.
[55:40.190 --> 55:42.430]  Like I just want as many people doing this as possible
[55:42.430 --> 55:45.630]  because you can see just from like the genetic side
[55:45.630 --> 55:46.990]  of things, this is a community.
[55:46.990 --> 55:49.390]  That's what we do is get growers together
[55:49.390 --> 55:50.550]  within their own communities.
[55:50.550 --> 55:54.470]  And then connect state to state until it's federally legal.
[55:54.470 --> 55:56.430]  And then we can do one all together
[55:56.430 --> 55:59.230]  with the conglomerate that you guys all do.
[56:00.030 --> 56:02.310]  The conglomerate that you guys all make together
[56:02.310 --> 56:04.270]  from all the different strains.
[56:04.270 --> 56:06.950]  Everybody knows seeds are federally legal, right?
[56:06.950 --> 56:09.150]  So we can mail.
[56:09.150 --> 56:11.390]  You can send them to the U.S. Postal Service.
[56:11.390 --> 56:14.070]  You can bring them on trains, on boats.
[56:14.070 --> 56:15.910]  I do that every day.
[56:15.910 --> 56:17.710]  I definitely never did that before.
[56:17.710 --> 56:18.550]  So.
[56:18.550 --> 56:19.870]  Never done it.
[56:19.870 --> 56:21.110]  Never done it.
[56:21.110 --> 56:22.470]  I've been in the U.S. Postal Service
[56:22.470 --> 56:23.550]  for 20 years.
[56:23.550 --> 56:25.790]  I still can't believe it.
[56:25.910 --> 56:29.270]  The U.S. Postal Service is the biggest drug dealer.
[56:29.270 --> 56:30.790]  Yeah.
[56:30.790 --> 56:32.590]  Let's remember all of our bad-ass growers
[56:32.590 --> 56:34.110]  are incarcerated right now too.
[56:34.110 --> 56:35.230]  So let's get them out of there.
[56:35.230 --> 56:36.070]  Yeah.
[56:36.070 --> 56:36.910]  Yeah.
[56:41.170 --> 56:43.530]  What, Peter, do we have any other questions
[56:43.530 --> 56:44.370]  that came through?
[56:44.370 --> 56:45.410]  I wasn't quite paying attention.
[56:45.410 --> 56:46.730]  Yeah, let me just mute.
[56:48.010 --> 56:50.170]  I'm gonna mute everyone for a second.
[56:50.170 --> 56:51.290]  And then, all right.
[56:51.290 --> 56:54.610]  So evidently the audio is a little better.
[56:55.610 --> 56:57.690]  And as I was joking,
[56:57.890 --> 56:59.890]  the people on YouTube probably didn't appreciate it,
[56:59.890 --> 57:02.370]  but I was like, it sounds great in the StreamYard.
[57:07.820 --> 57:09.980]  Yeah, I think, well, from me,
[57:09.980 --> 57:14.540]  I mean, the first two people kind of talked about
[57:14.540 --> 57:18.140]  like themselves, like their kind of intent as breeders
[57:18.140 --> 57:20.900]  and kind of if we could just quickly go around everyone else
[57:20.900 --> 57:23.460]  and, you know, I breed for medical.
[57:23.460 --> 57:25.980]  I breed for, you know, I play with land race.
[57:25.980 --> 57:28.700]  I breed for the hype market.
[57:29.380 --> 57:32.540]  I, you know, like specific terpene profiles
[57:32.540 --> 57:34.420]  and I breed for kind of what I like.
[57:34.420 --> 57:36.620]  And this is what I personally like.
[57:37.500 --> 57:39.740]  You guys can just kind of go around the horn.
[57:40.780 --> 57:42.340]  Or Jason, since you don't breed,
[57:42.340 --> 57:44.220]  what do you like to smoke personally?
[57:45.100 --> 57:46.340]  You know, you guys are gonna laugh.
[57:46.340 --> 57:49.180]  I'm like an old hippie green crack guy, man.
[57:49.180 --> 57:50.940]  I don't know, but I'm just a goofy.
[57:50.940 --> 57:54.220]  I like that goofy high, you know?
[57:54.220 --> 57:55.860]  I mean, I can throw them down,
[57:55.860 --> 57:57.900]  but I'm more of a green crack kind of goofy guy.
[57:57.900 --> 57:59.180]  You know what I mean?
[57:59.180 --> 58:01.340]  A lot of stuff's a little strong for me.
[58:01.340 --> 58:03.940]  You know, I'm not quite the smoke dog I used to be,
[58:03.940 --> 58:06.660]  but yeah, I would say the skunks, man.
[58:06.660 --> 58:08.740]  I love the skunks and some of the skunks
[58:08.740 --> 58:10.140]  that really show a little more sativa in them.
[58:10.140 --> 58:11.140]  You know what I mean?
[58:11.140 --> 58:13.620]  And yeah, anybody got any of that green crack hiding around?
[58:13.620 --> 58:14.660]  I'd love to see that again.
[58:14.660 --> 58:15.660]  So the original.
[58:21.360 --> 58:22.360]  You're up.
[58:22.360 --> 58:23.360]  I'm up.
[58:23.360 --> 58:24.560]  Can you guys hear me?
[58:24.560 --> 58:25.400]  All right, cool.
[58:25.400 --> 58:28.680]  So, you know, our project has always been to breed for hash.
[58:28.680 --> 58:33.680]  So we breed mostly for terpenes and secondary cannabinoids.
[58:35.560 --> 58:39.320]  And then how that presents into extracts
[58:39.320 --> 58:42.200]  is really what our interest level has been
[58:42.200 --> 58:44.260]  for the last many years.
[58:45.280 --> 58:49.360]  And so, you know, a lot of our stuff has lots of CBD
[58:49.360 --> 58:52.040]  and CBG and THCBA and things like that,
[58:52.040 --> 58:54.920]  and has minor cannabinoids.
[58:54.920 --> 58:58.240]  And then there's a lot of interesting terpenes
[58:58.800 --> 59:01.240]  and flavonoids that come in our stuff too,
[59:01.240 --> 59:04.040]  so that we can make better tasting hash.
[59:04.040 --> 59:05.880]  And when you do smoke hash,
[59:05.880 --> 59:09.360]  what kind of flavor profiles do you personally like?
[59:09.360 --> 59:11.440]  In hash, I like fruit.
[59:11.440 --> 59:13.160]  In weed, I like gas.
[59:13.160 --> 59:15.240]  So, you know, it kind of depends on what I'm going for,
[59:15.240 --> 59:19.040]  but, you know, especially rosins and things,
[59:19.040 --> 59:21.860]  lemons and berries are where it's at for me.
[59:27.800 --> 59:28.640]  It's my turn.
[59:29.640 --> 59:31.880]  So what are my favorite terps?
[59:31.880 --> 59:33.600]  Is that the question?
[59:33.600 --> 59:36.200]  No, just kind of what, I mean, that's part of it,
[59:36.200 --> 59:39.380]  but kind of what do you breed for?
[59:39.380 --> 59:41.120]  Like, what do you like to explore
[59:41.120 --> 59:43.360]  and focus on in your projects?
[59:43.360 --> 59:46.320]  And then personally, what do you like smoking?
[59:47.880 --> 59:50.320]  So currently right now I have a spritzer.
[59:50.320 --> 59:52.800]  That was the 2020 grow off strain.
[59:52.800 --> 59:55.080]  That is a strain that I'm in the process
[59:55.080 --> 59:56.720]  of making a feminized seeds from.
[59:56.720 --> 59:58.480]  So I reversed the spritzer
[59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.760]  and I'm going to make a bunch of new crosses.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:03.800]  But what I had in mind for this was making a hash line.
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:08.080]  Like spritzers known to wash like around six or 7% return
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.840]  with some crazy high return on the press.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.240]  So I pretty much wanted to make a line
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.120]  that's going to be pretty much hash washers,
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.880]  unique terp profiles,
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:19.640]  breeding strains specifically for connoisseurs,
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.800]  the aficionados, the cannabis cognoscenti's out there.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.780]  I kind of wanted to do some, a little bit of both,
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:26.980]  like the cookies to cookies
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:29.460]  and then the cookies cross and non-cookie stuff,
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:33.540]  like OG's and chems and sours and stuff like that, skittles.
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:37.580]  So try and get some different new terps in the mix.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:40.980]  Right now, the most anticipated one that I got right now
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.900]  at the top two is probably like the hazelnut cream
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.900]  to spritzer and then the African haze 11 to spritzer.
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.540]  That African haze 11, if you've never tried that,
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:50.540]  that's from Bronson Farms.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:53.620]  One of my favorite hazes period, like an 11, 12 week haze.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.900]  But this is like amazing flavor.
[01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:59.380]  Like if you ever heard of PIF or had any kind of PIF terps,
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.020]  definitely you'd like the African haze 11.
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.060]  So that cross to the spritzer should definitely
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.300]  produce some new unique terps into the market,
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.140]  which I'm definitely looking forward to.
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.040]  Hope it wasn't too choppy.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.540]  There you go, good.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:25.540]  So the reason why, what I breed for,
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:29.460]  it started out as just, you know, personal satisfaction,
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:33.660]  a challenge of making something that was just amazing
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:37.380]  or not just amazing, maybe even the best.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.800]  Being from an island, we're very localized.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.340]  And when someone has the best, it spreads really quickly
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:47.460]  through the whole island that they've got the best.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.760]  So it's always been fun.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.420]  And that challenge has always been fun.
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:51.940]  When people have told me of anything
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.820]  that you can't grow that, that doesn't grow here.
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.540]  Oh, well, that sounds like a challenge to me.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.380]  Sounds like I'm gonna grow it.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.340]  And I grow mainly outdoor.
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:04.340]  So growing outdoor, I have to grow a huge variety.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:07.100]  The seasons are crazy out here on the island.
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.140]  The humidity is out of control.
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:11.500]  It's probably one of the most inhospitable
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.500]  growing environments in the whole country.
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:18.180]  So, you know, I have to have up to 18 plus strains
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.420]  outdoors all times.
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:23.260]  And at sometimes you'll lose six strains in full.
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:26.220]  So breeding has to do a lot with the,
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:27.660]  finding the strains that work,
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:28.940]  finding the right ones.
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:31.100]  And the challenge is always great.
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:33.260]  You know, it's always fun to pick something and say,
[01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:36.340]  I'm gonna make this and then go make it.
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.980]  I don't find the strains first.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:40.260]  Sometimes I pick what I wanna make.
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.220]  I wanna make something that smells like bananas.
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:46.060]  Then I have to go find so many strains
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:49.180]  to find the male and the female that actually smell
[01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:50.460]  that way to put them together.
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.500]  So breeding a lot of it is a challenge.
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.460]  It's a lot of the personal satisfaction
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.060]  and it's the fun of it.
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.420]  Finding something new, something spectacular
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:00.940]  when you give it to someone and they go,
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:03.140]  whoa, it blows their mind.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:04.500]  That's why we do it.
[01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:15.050]  Well, for me, it's,
[01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:17.290]  I'm not much of a breeder like everybody here.
[01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:20.170]  So it's a privilege to be even with you guys.
[01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:22.930]  I'm more of like your average consumer.
[01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:26.090]  You know, I have a few packs from a few of you guys here.
[01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:29.290]  So for me, I just love to hunt.
[01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:33.250]  If I do like something that's gonna drop,
[01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:36.290]  I'm gonna get two packs of it, pop it,
[01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:39.890]  see if I can find something out of two or three packs.
[01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:41.330]  Just that type of consumer.
[01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:44.290]  So for me, I'm just having fun,
[01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:46.170]  just looking for those phenos.
[01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:49.570]  And that's my big thing, just trying to have fun with it,
[01:03:49.570 --> 01:03:51.050]  popping everybody's seeds.
[01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:54.290]  Whenever I get an opportunity to see somebody's work,
[01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:55.810]  I'll reach out to ask.
[01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:58.850]  For me, it doesn't hurt to ask.
[01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:03.090]  So whatever's out there, I'm gonna ask
[01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:04.770]  and I'm gonna try and get it.
[01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:07.850]  I've even flown out to California a couple of times
[01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:10.210]  for some clone drops.
[01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:11.770]  For me, it's just having fun, man,
[01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:13.050]  and trying to bring that shit over here
[01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:16.050]  to like the East Coast side and DMV area.
[01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:20.570]  And what do you personally like to smoke?
[01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:23.850]  Right now, I'm honestly stuck on a banana cream cake
[01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:27.050]  crossed with Jealousy from Sea Junkie.
[01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:30.090]  That shit is, shit's fucking crazy.
[01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:31.730]  Is it flour or hash?
[01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:33.690]  It's flour, yeah, flour.
[01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:36.490]  I went out there and grabbed a clone for the drop
[01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:41.490]  and yeah, it's probably one of the biggest positives
[01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:43.970]  I've done since I've been growing.
[01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:45.650]  So that was a big thing.
[01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:48.410]  But yeah, it's really stuck in my library right now.
[01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:50.650]  So it's rotation, it's heavy.
[01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:53.690]  All right, let me do.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.800]  All right, so what's going on guys, you hear me?
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.840]  The main crew.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.720]  Hey, what's going on, Peter?
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:08.800]  Can you guys hear me?
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.840]  Yeah, we can hear you, bud.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.960]  Nice, yeah, I'm primarily a gas head.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.320]  I like those OGs, chems, the sour, that funk.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.120]  But lately I've been really kind of getting
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.440]  into the Skittle Serps.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:27.960]  There's a few cookie runs, crosses that we've been finding
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.800]  lately in the seed hunt that have really started
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.680]  to open my mind to those candy turps once again.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:37.160]  I remember trying that back in 2016 at the Emerald Cup
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.560]  with the turp hogs, kind of threw that out there.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.760]  And that was one of those turps
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.000]  that just always stuck with me.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.800]  So I love the candy turps.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.040]  I'm primarily a gas head.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.400]  I breed for flavor, pretty much solely.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.720]  Effect as well, we're looking for some things
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.640]  that can help people medicinally.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:57.640]  Did a couple CBD projects that really helped
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.920]  a lot of Crohn's patients and IBS patients.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.280]  So we're trying to bring some of that back as well.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:06.240]  But primarily for turps and short flowering times
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.480]  and hardy plants for this main weather.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.080]  Yeah, I'm Jason's apprentice.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:17.560]  So I'm kind of like shadowing him through this whole process
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.800]  which has been unbelievable to watch.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.000]  But I'm a big citrus guy
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.960]  and we have some serious citrus coming down.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.280]  So I'm looking forward to that.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.240]  And I've kind of fallen in love with the Kawaii Candy
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.560]  from 808, that stuff's like gas candy all day long.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:40.560]  So anything with gas or citrus is kind of my game.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.080]  And especially on the exhale.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:52.380]  I had to throw on a hat, everyone in the comments.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:57.380]  Is there anyone with no, without a hat on.
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:58.620]  There you go.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.540]  Do you got a beard you can throw on too?
[01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:01.380]  No.
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:05.500]  Keeps the sun off us.
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:06.540]  That's right.
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:10.860]  Well, I'll answer what I'm smoking.
[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.060]  Obviously don't breed
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.860]  because who would have the time
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:15.260]  after everything else we're doing.
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:19.620]  But I'm preserving some of the Hype Train
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:23.300]  from the last Colorado Cup with some Boveda packs.
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.260]  So smoking on that.
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:27.260]  And then Jake's cousin is this awesome grower
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.340]  down in Crested Butte.
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:31.940]  I have no idea what he brought us, but it's awesome.
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.940]  And he's unfortunately not allowed to compete
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.220]  because we're a fair competition and family,
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.860]  or sorry, family members are allowed
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:42.620]  to join the grow off unfortunately.
[01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:48.620]  We can just do a friends and family one.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:49.460]  There you go.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:52.700]  So, all right.
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:56.820]  So any other chat questions?
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:01.500]  Someone asked about auto seeds I saw at one point
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:04.900]  and we've been asked to do competitions.
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:08.260]  And wrapping my brain around that,
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:09.940]  everyone gets a lottery ticket.
[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:10.940]  Do they pop?
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:11.860]  Do they not?
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:13.700]  That's why we do the clone thing.
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:17.100]  But I am curious if y'all have opinions on autos.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.500]  I have opinions.
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:23.580]  Lots of opinions.
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:25.620]  If I need some bumper crop in my veg
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.740]  or an early July crop maybe.
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:30.220]  But dude, night owl's always been
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.540]  kind of some of my go-to or Mephisto.
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:33.380]  Mephisto.
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:34.220]  Yeah.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:35.820]  Those are the 10 guys.
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:40.580]  But Daz actually just moved back to Maine.
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.540]  So we've been kind of chatting back and forth
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:45.860]  about a few things, but I trust his work a lot.
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:48.220]  But I feel like as far as the competition style,
[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.860]  it might be something where you might give somebody
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:54.180]  six seeds to kind of maybe everybody gets
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:57.140]  to make their selection out of a six seed lot.
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:59.940]  Rather than having to have like one plant
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:02.540]  to kind of move forward with, so to speak.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:03.860]  Yeah, but then how do you judge it?
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.980]  Because it can't be tested.
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:09.220]  Because one pheno is gonna test higher than another pheno.
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.660]  He can't clone an auto flower.
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:12.500]  No.
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.940]  Those sections, you damage the roots just once or twice.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:21.220]  There's really no way to have a baseline on that.
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:26.700]  Auto flower, and they just quote have the,
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:29.460]  they don't have what the regular, the photo.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.220]  That's for sure.
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.260]  They don't really have those capabilities.
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.660]  So it would be tough, but you'd probably just have to do
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:37.300]  like the best selection out of everybody's pack of seeds
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.500]  and kind of hope that you got a good selection.
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.580]  But I mean, that is analytical results.
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.500]  It would be kind of a toss up.
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.060]  Do you guys read much auto flower?
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:51.740]  I've done it several times and I do regular auto flower.
[01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:53.300]  I do, I mean, I've done it a lot
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.300]  and I have some really cool auto flowers.
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:56.220]  You guys wanna try them out.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.100]  I have a mix, which is like, I've got purple, blacks,
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:02.740]  reds, blues, and greens in the mix.
[01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:05.540]  So you'll get, you'll have a great, beautiful garden.
[01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:06.380]  You know, you're welcome.
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.340]  Where are you on the island?
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:10.180]  Where are you on the vineyard?
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:11.140]  West Tewsbury.
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.900]  It's like right in the middle.
[01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:13.900]  I'll come check you out.
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:15.140]  Cause I always go over there.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.580]  Oh, floss.
[01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:17.740]  Cool. Yeah, man.
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.380]  I'm around, I'm on island.
[01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:21.620]  I'm here, you know, we'll tour around.
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:24.300]  We'll check out some cool stuff, you know, and.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.340]  Yeah. Oh yeah.
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.180]  Seeds.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:28.700]  Absolutely, man.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.360]  Oh, oh yes.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.360]  Thank you, Peter.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:41.360]  This is, we just implemented pathogen testing two years ago
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:45.720]  and it caused just so many additional issues
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:46.760]  on top of everything else
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.920]  because people weren't talking as much
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.000]  about hop slatin as they are now.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.240]  And I still don't think that a lot of growers
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.920]  know what it is.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:58.400]  And we are testing for it for the grow off clones.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.640]  So I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on the topic.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.080]  I mean, I saw a hoplatin viroid like years ago
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.760]  on some gelato cuts that ended making their way up here
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.760]  before everybody was talking about it.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.120]  And I was kind of noticing like a dudding,
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.120]  quote unquote, dudding disease.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.320]  And it was very random on the plant.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.240]  Like there could be one branch that was looking funky
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.040]  but the rest of the plant was fine.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.520]  Kind of started noticing it moving to other strains.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.880]  So at that point I had to just kind of
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.360]  mix the garden to move on.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.160]  And honestly, I haven't seen it since
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.960]  but it just seems to be,
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.240]  when you're purchasing clones from trusted places
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.120]  it's hard to know where everybody's getting
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.440]  and sourcing their things.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.200]  And unless there's like some sort of
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.840]  breed or pedigree documentation that comes with it
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.480]  there's really no way to know unless you test everything.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.440]  It's only 25 bucks per plant to get it tested.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.600]  So it's not a very expensive test
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.020]  but when you're taking in new things
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.480]  you just have to take every precaution
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.800]  and hoplatin viroid's gonna be
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:02.200]  one of those things until you do some seed pops
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.480]  and there is some discussion that it can transfer to seed
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:06.840]  into the progeny as well.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:10.120]  So, you know, best thing that you can do for yourself
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.640]  is to start from seed as much as possible.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.640]  I've heard a lot of people say that they've,
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.760]  they can get rid of it through tissue culture
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:20.340]  also through out and new cloning new tips.
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:22.320]  You guys have anyone able to-
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.160]  Who's tested it before?
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.320]  You can get rid of it a lot of ways.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.000]  The problem is it's a virus.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.500]  So it lives within the plant.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.340]  And I'm like-
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.660]  It's a viroid.
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.160]  Okay.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:35.000]  Very true.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.040]  So I've heard there's a company advertising
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.480]  they'll cleanse hoplatin viroid
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.480]  out of a tissue culture plants.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.240]  It's in California actually.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.440]  I don't remember what it was
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:51.240]  but they said you could send them your infected plants
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.560]  and they will cleanse them for you
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.400]  and send you back the uninfected clone.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.560]  You're going to keep that genetic though.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.400]  Absolutely.
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.240]  The phylos.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.080]  The phylos.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:08.080]  I'm just interested in the cleansing of the genetics.
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.060]  They said they can do all types of paths.
[01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:14.240]  Interesting.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.520]  It's possible for sure.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.000]  I mean, the plant is looking human.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.200]  If you get a virus,
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.280]  you can cleanse that virus from your system.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:24.880]  You know, if you're a strong enough immune system
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.520]  to be able to fight off
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.320]  and then not necessarily transfer it
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.760]  into the next clone generation
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.720]  because it doesn't necessarily affect the whole plant
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.920]  at the same time.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.120]  You know, like some part of the plant can be affected
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.100]  while other parts of the plant are not.
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:41.560]  And it doesn't necessarily mean
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.920]  that when you transfer it forward,
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:46.200]  you're going to be transferring it forward with the virus.
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.120]  It's a really weird deal, honestly.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:51.080]  And it's really important we talk more about it
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.360]  because so few people know
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.320]  that it's even existing in their gardens.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.840]  They have no idea why entire cloners are dying off
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.480]  or entire trays of plants are dying off
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.760]  all at once in the middle of a flower.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.000]  It's just the weirdest shit, you know?
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.320]  So, I mean, I think that it's really important
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.120]  to sort of try and understand this
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.440]  and then also not to necessarily be afraid of it
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.000]  because we can kill it.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.840]  We can figure out ways to clean the plants.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.880]  And it doesn't mean that once you get it,
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.800]  then your genetic that you've loved for 20 years
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.720]  is necessarily gone.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.680]  It's not.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.920]  It just means that you got some work to do.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.080]  Yeah, there's products like Bicon S
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.360]  that you can use to clean and sterilize your equipment
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.200]  to make sure that you're not passing it on to other plants
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.720]  and making sure your SOPs are good
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.440]  when you're going from plant to plant
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.360]  based on using new scalpels
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:42.480]  or making sure that you're cleaning your utensils as you go.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.560]  That's a product that you can kind of find
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.720]  at most Walmarts.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.000]  It's in the pet section.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.800]  It's a yellow tub, but it is a virus side
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.720]  that works pretty well
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.720]  for cleaning and sterilizing equipment.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.840]  Well, another thing that I think is interesting
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.000]  about hoplite is that you tend to see it in environments
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.800]  where the plants aren't necessarily as strong.
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:11.800]  So, and I'm not saying that this is 100% of the case
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.320]  for the place where I see hoplite virus.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:17.320]  The worst is in complicated hydro systems.
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:20.200]  So if you have like a super complicated drip system
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:23.360]  or an aeroponic system or something like that,
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:26.200]  then hoplite virus has a real chance
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.720]  of taking over your plants in a way
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.720]  that it doesn't necessarily, if you run,
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.680]  maybe a more organic based system
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:37.680]  where the plants have a stronger immune system.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.400]  Or if you run a system that is just where the plants
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.800]  have a stronger immune system, even in hydro,
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.000]  you don't see it as much.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.360]  It's really where you're having problems
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.040]  in the first place is where you tend to see
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.040]  a lot more hoplite virus.
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.360]  Anything that's susceptible to disease
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.800]  is gonna get it first, no matter what.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.320]  Especially with older plants,
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.560]  like specifically with like plant count laws,
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.440]  like some people are growing six plants under six lights.
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:09.680]  So you're getting like a 10 or 12 week veg on a plant.
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:13.040]  Whereas in our situation, we're running three gallon pots
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.480]  that's running over every three weeks.
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.480]  So it doesn't have a chance to express itself
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.480]  as long as it's in like perfect plant health.
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.320]  Obviously we don't have those issues here at the moment,
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.960]  but so plant health above all.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:28.400]  And if you keep them healthier and you have plants
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.640]  that haven't been mothered out so much
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.240]  and or growing in a small pot for so long.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:38.840]  Replacing your mother plants really often is key.
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:41.560]  I replace them every three weeks.
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:43.040]  I got a bug out guys.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.240]  That's the battle of how long they'll last.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.640]  There you go.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:48.480]  Thanks John.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.320]  And that's it.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.600]  See you guys later.
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:51.680]  Gotta replace them.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.280]  And then go again, keep them healthy,
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:55.680]  keep them growing healthy.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.640]  When you're going on a small scale indoors,
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.080]  I don't do much indoor growing,
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:05.480]  but what I've found is that once the roots fill the pot size
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:07.280]  you're a hundred percent relying
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.800]  on your fertilizer regimen and schedule.
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:12.360]  But if you give that pot some space,
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.840]  those roots a lot of space to grow,
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.280]  that way, especially through flower.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.640]  When I grow indoor,
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.840]  I have run into that problem all the time,
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.720]  vegging too long.
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.800]  So I only veg for 14 to 20 days.
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:25.640]  That's it.
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.000]  Hit them in 14 days, veg, bam, flower.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.480]  So that the roots never actually fill the pot
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:33.680]  and they're healthy the whole flower cycle.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:37.160]  If you can get to the end of the flower with healthy roots,
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:40.060]  the healthier the plant, the healthier and better the bud.
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:44.980]  Which in like, you know, larger rooms
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:47.180]  with larger plant counts and smaller pots,
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:49.740]  you can achieve with more watering intervals
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:51.700]  and watching your dry backs a lot.
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.060]  And that's where, you know,
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.960]  the technical aspect of growing really starts taking hold.
[01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:58.940]  Yeah. You can't just plug it into a computer.
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:02.820]  Like most grow houses who run like a 70 day program
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:04.500]  for every single strain.
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.540]  And they wonder why half of them are, you know,
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:09.260]  two, three weeks too long, have somewhere too early.
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.780]  It's because you're just running by the computer program.
[01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.780]  You're just doing the 70 day boom done
[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:16.700]  on the fertilizer program.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:19.780]  And you're not catering it to the plant.
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:22.300]  You're just catering the grow to the system
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:23.960]  and it does not work.
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:27.500]  Yeah. I always say that a successful grow
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:31.580]  is a culmination of the sacrifices you made for that fire.
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.140]  You know, you started a hundred,
[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:34.140]  it's up to you to keep it.
[01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:37.320]  Like my old history teacher used to say,
[01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:44.250]  but I also need to cruise,
[01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:46.210]  but it was been a pleasure talking with everybody.
[01:18:46.210 --> 01:18:48.010]  I love meeting all you guys.
[01:18:48.010 --> 01:18:51.190]  Well, should we wrap it on that?
[01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:55.490]  It seems like we're dwindling down past the Brady Bunch.
[01:18:57.810 --> 01:19:00.890]  We went from Brady Bunch formation to the...
[01:19:02.890 --> 01:19:04.370]  Call us the Brady Bunch.
[01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:06.730]  Brady Bunch.
[01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:11.450]  I feel like that should be a t-shirt
[01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:13.250]  that Sam has made up for us all.
[01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:17.050]  You have a job now, Sam.
[01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:23.450]  And the big pharma question we can save
[01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:25.530]  for the next conversation.
[01:19:25.530 --> 01:19:26.570]  All right. I love it.
[01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:28.570]  What are you doing to prepare for big pharma
[01:19:28.570 --> 01:19:30.010]  entering this space?
[01:19:30.130 --> 01:19:30.970]  Ooh.
[01:19:33.450 --> 01:19:37.090]  I will say our focus is on finding breeders
[01:19:37.090 --> 01:19:38.130]  doing interesting things.
[01:19:38.130 --> 01:19:39.390]  We touched on this earlier,
[01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:41.810]  people that are using stuff that's not widely available.
[01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:43.970]  So I appreciate all of you for what you do,
[01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:47.010]  what you do for growers and for doing the hardest thing
[01:19:47.010 --> 01:19:49.570]  that I probably you've been asked to do
[01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:52.210]  is create a hundred clones that look identical
[01:19:52.210 --> 01:19:56.050]  and make sure they're clean and on time and all of that.
[01:19:56.050 --> 01:19:56.890]  It's a lot.
[01:19:56.890 --> 01:19:58.770]  And I really, really appreciate all the work you guys do.
[01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:00.770]  It is really, really hard, Sam.
[01:20:04.290 --> 01:20:05.970]  I want you to know that as somebody
[01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:07.170]  who's done this a long time,
[01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:08.890]  that is a really hard challenge.
[01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:15.850]  Cool. I'm excited to meet the three that are left
[01:20:15.850 --> 01:20:18.010]  that we haven't been out to see you yet.
[01:20:18.010 --> 01:20:20.770]  So our website has the schedule on it.
[01:20:20.770 --> 01:20:23.410]  The growoff.com entries, 50 bucks,
[01:20:23.410 --> 01:20:27.050]  unless you apply for the social equity, it's 25 bucks.
[01:20:27.090 --> 01:20:30.690]  So I want to see all types of growers this year.
[01:20:30.690 --> 01:20:34.050]  Can we think a future cannabis project for having us too?
[01:20:34.050 --> 01:20:36.490]  Because Peter always, thank you.
[01:20:36.490 --> 01:20:37.330]  Absolutely.
[01:20:37.330 --> 01:20:38.170]  For sure.
[01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:39.970]  Sam, Peter, thank you.
[01:20:39.970 --> 01:20:40.810]  I appreciate you man.
[01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:41.650]  Thanks for having us.
[01:20:41.650 --> 01:20:43.730]  I'm going to eat my lunch now.
[01:20:43.730 --> 01:20:45.530]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:47.690]  You've been holding off.
[01:20:47.690 --> 01:20:48.610]  Was that that noise?
[01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:51.010]  Was it like a sub sandwich wrapper?
[01:20:53.410 --> 01:20:54.650]  You as the crinkler.
[01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:57.690]  No, the crinklers probably.
[01:20:57.690 --> 01:20:59.490]  We're trying to deal with metric right now
[01:20:59.490 --> 01:21:01.330]  and getting all of the seeds that I've made
[01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:03.690]  into metric is one hell of a challenge.
[01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:04.970]  Oh, no joke.
[01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:05.810]  Yeah.
[01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:07.250]  Yeah, we've got until the 27th
[01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:11.290]  and I'm through like 130 seeds or strains so far.
[01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:12.810]  And we're just on THC.
[01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:15.530]  So like there's a lot more to do.
[01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:17.850]  Well, good luck and God speed.
[01:21:17.850 --> 01:21:18.930]  Appreciate you guys man.
[01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:19.850]  Take care.
[01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:20.690]  Thanks everyone.
[01:21:20.690 --> 01:21:22.370]  Yeah, pleasure to meet all of you.
[01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:23.730]  Peter, Saint, thank you.
[01:21:23.770 --> 01:21:24.610]  This was so fun.
[01:21:24.610 --> 01:21:25.450]  No problem.
[01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:26.290]  Thank you everyone.
[01:21:26.290 --> 01:21:27.130]  Have a wonderful night.
[01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:27.970]  Bye.
[01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:29.050]  We'll end on that.
[01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:31.650]  Just the two.
