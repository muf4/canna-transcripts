[00:32.700 --> 00:34.700]  Well
[00:35.520 --> 00:39.600]  Good morning to this week's show I want everybody to
[00:40.200 --> 00:48.020]  Get ready because we're gonna have an interesting drill down. We're gonna drill down on some hemp with a gentleman from Italy
[00:48.540 --> 00:54.540]  I can't pronounce his name in Italian, but he said Michael will do so
[00:55.320 --> 01:00.240]  Everybody welcome the Italian hemp King Michael welcome
[01:00.240 --> 01:02.240]  Hello, hello everybody
[01:02.240 --> 01:04.240]  It's a pleasure to be here with you
[01:04.240 --> 01:14.240]  Can you tell us a little bit about where you are and what you're breeding?
[01:14.240 --> 01:16.240]  Yeah
[01:16.240 --> 01:23.240]  I'm in the north side of Italy close to France on the coast in a Mediterranean environment and
[01:23.240 --> 01:27.020]  My purpose was to breed
[01:27.840 --> 01:34.900]  Italian variety of this area and the closest area of the flatland in Piedmont
[01:35.600 --> 01:39.700]  Where there were the majority part of our variety pool
[01:41.240 --> 01:43.760]  The first objective was to
[01:44.920 --> 01:49.520]  Make those varieties suited for a dry and hot
[01:50.440 --> 01:52.440]  climate as I am and
[01:53.600 --> 01:56.600]  Was a long journey starting from the beginning
[01:57.640 --> 02:00.520]  five years ago or a little bit more and
[02:02.480 --> 02:04.480]  Was very nice
[02:04.480 --> 02:07.360]  We still have to make some progress
[02:08.440 --> 02:13.460]  but we definitely are happy of the selection and the
[02:13.920 --> 02:18.080]  methodology that we used in these years to make the
[02:18.440 --> 02:20.440]  the best quality materials
[02:20.960 --> 02:22.720]  material as possible
[02:22.720 --> 02:24.720]  for our purpose
[02:26.600 --> 02:29.360]  Yeah dry dry and hot as in
[02:30.160 --> 02:32.160]  30 degrees C
[02:32.200 --> 02:39.320]  Like maybe 90 degrees Fahrenheit and and then your humidity is what below 40
[02:40.680 --> 02:46.080]  My humidity during the summer. It's close to be around 40
[02:47.080 --> 02:50.840]  Especially now in this moment we are at 40
[02:51.200 --> 02:56.360]  40 of humidity during the day and a little bit more during the night
[02:57.120 --> 03:01.080]  to 70 80 percent because there is a
[03:01.680 --> 03:05.840]  good gap of temperature between the day and the night and
[03:06.760 --> 03:08.760]  humidity rise up
[03:08.880 --> 03:09.960]  but
[03:09.960 --> 03:12.640]  the main issue for me was
[03:13.320 --> 03:18.960]  To acclimatize the variety to a very stressful environment
[03:19.960 --> 03:21.960]  with no rain and
[03:23.400 --> 03:25.400]  During the summer no rain at all
[03:26.400 --> 03:31.000]  And the necessity to have a very good taproot system
[03:31.680 --> 03:35.280]  that could prevent the necessity of
[03:36.480 --> 03:39.240]  using too much water for the grow and
[03:39.920 --> 03:41.000]  And
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.840]  Yeah, we could say that the weather is changing so fast already. This environment was a
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  difficult environment to grow
[03:51.440 --> 03:53.640]  For the lack of water during the summer
[03:55.640 --> 03:57.640]  Especially from rain then
[03:57.800 --> 04:01.600]  Obviously we have water from Springs and from from Wales
[04:02.240 --> 04:04.000]  in order to
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  Take care of our crops
[04:06.640 --> 04:10.280]  Unfortunately, the weather is changing so fast
[04:11.400 --> 04:12.720]  that
[04:12.720 --> 04:18.880]  We have to work much more on the variety pool in order
[04:20.560 --> 04:25.320]  To help them to adapt to this changing so fast
[04:26.920 --> 04:28.920]  Do you select
[04:29.200 --> 04:31.200]  You're selecting for
[04:31.320 --> 04:35.080]  Drought resistance is in your hemp I saw on your website
[04:35.080 --> 04:39.240]  You've got six different varieties of hemp on there and they're all
[04:39.680 --> 04:46.840]  less than point three three on the the THC and around eight or ten on the
[04:48.040 --> 04:50.040]  THC with some CBG in there
[04:50.320 --> 04:56.640]  Do you do you select for chemotype or do you select for drought resistance or structure?
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.400]  How do you go about your selection because you have to have a goal a
[05:02.040 --> 05:07.760]  Yellow is just one. Oh, the goal is changed many times during the years
[05:08.320 --> 05:13.920]  in the sense that in the first two or three years our main
[05:14.880 --> 05:21.480]  focus one was on structure and structure of the root in order to
[05:22.240 --> 05:28.440]  Make the variety with that are able to resist to all these eat and
[05:29.520 --> 05:36.400]  To grow well without large amount of water not without water without large amount of water
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.840]  Then we moved on on the chemotype
[05:40.320 --> 05:41.640]  obviously
[05:41.640 --> 05:47.080]  because this was a selection for a pre-base variety and
[05:48.080 --> 05:55.320]  The work goes on in in the direction of having a chemotype with those
[05:56.640 --> 06:01.480]  Characteristic that we have decided to have in structure and taproot system
[06:03.800 --> 06:11.680]  That was the idea now the results are quite good because we have developed
[06:12.360 --> 06:16.120]  Fields of production all around in Italy and also in Europe
[06:17.360 --> 06:19.680]  sometimes also in United States and
[06:20.360 --> 06:24.160]  we have got very good data about the
[06:25.640 --> 06:29.640]  Capability of the variety to adapt to those different weather
[06:30.520 --> 06:35.960]  So one example is in West Virginia where there is a lot of water instead of us
[06:36.000 --> 06:42.400]  But the idea was always to try to test the worst case
[06:43.400 --> 06:50.000]  scenario and then we will have better results and better data in good conditions
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.800]  Of course, the chemotype is very important for me, especially on a population base
[06:57.040 --> 06:59.560]  Maybe my idea was to improve and maintain
[07:01.040 --> 07:03.040]  Once I get through the chemotype
[07:03.080 --> 07:08.880]  I understood that they were two different roads, you know
[07:09.640 --> 07:14.240]  Because maintain an heirloom races. It means maintain the
[07:14.920 --> 07:20.280]  Diversity and the fitness of the variety the capability to adapt
[07:21.120 --> 07:23.120]  instead improve
[07:23.920 --> 07:29.480]  for commercial purposes, it means use bottleneck and
[07:29.840 --> 07:31.840]  Lose these
[07:32.560 --> 07:40.880]  Capability of adapt and also the variability of inside the strain because customer obviously need
[07:42.080 --> 07:45.320]  Something that is stable and reliable, you know
[07:45.840 --> 07:52.080]  So I understood that those two things that I put in the title, you know at the starting
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  They were two different things
[07:55.480 --> 07:57.480]  They were two different things
[07:57.760 --> 08:04.840]  But I'm very happy of that because the thing that moved me every day in my farm and what I do is the passion
[08:05.440 --> 08:07.720]  for the work and for the study I
[08:10.920 --> 08:17.040]  Think that is putting in simple in a simple way is more
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.680]  Interesting the travel, you know, then the place where we are going
[08:24.480 --> 08:26.480]  So right
[08:26.920 --> 08:32.360]  In your name says sativa creations and I know generally I find the thin leaf
[08:33.080 --> 08:40.480]  Cannabis has a specific chemotype that it's tending tend it tends to be less sedative on the medicinal side
[08:40.560 --> 08:42.560]  and more
[08:42.640 --> 08:43.680]  Oh
[08:43.680 --> 08:46.260]  I don't know uplifting and it has a
[08:46.640 --> 08:51.760]  It can tend to make people feel paranoid and stuff when it's the THC varieties
[08:51.760 --> 08:54.960]  But I haven't done a lot of work with hemp varieties. I've done some
[08:55.920 --> 08:59.680]  Testing to see how how well they hold to their point three three
[08:59.680 --> 09:05.400]  And I found that if I take anything and just run it a little bit long. It's up around 1%
[09:06.120 --> 09:12.840]  With the tea. Yeah, that is true. That is absolutely true. That is absolutely true because this is
[09:14.280 --> 09:17.000]  The parameter where the population
[09:17.800 --> 09:19.800]  Stay in the wild
[09:19.840 --> 09:22.640]  Okay, so we could definitely say
[09:23.440 --> 09:29.480]  that mostly of the variety get to 1% naturally in the sense that if the
[09:30.320 --> 09:35.000]  cross-pollination of course the genetics get to that point so
[09:35.960 --> 09:40.520]  Trying to stay under this level. It means making a lot of work
[09:41.480 --> 09:44.480]  Because we have to make a selection
[09:44.920 --> 09:46.920]  Not
[09:49.720 --> 09:51.720]  On the middle results
[09:53.280 --> 10:00.480]  On the on the middle results of the of the curve, but we have to select just a small fraction
[10:01.400 --> 10:04.880]  of the code that not only naturally occur and
[10:06.680 --> 10:08.680]  So could be or
[10:08.680 --> 10:10.680]  a
[10:12.400 --> 10:14.400]  Selection that goes in a direction
[10:15.320 --> 10:16.640]  You know
[10:16.640 --> 10:24.040]  Right. So you're you're trying to basically select out the THC synthase gene and only keep
[10:24.720 --> 10:26.720]  something that would produce
[10:26.760 --> 10:34.240]  CBD a and CBGA and then you watch how it's converting to the CBG or C CBD
[10:34.520 --> 10:40.280]  Close to the end and then you you cut it at a particular time before you your key
[10:40.280 --> 10:43.760]  It's a bum but no absolutely not
[10:44.320 --> 10:45.720]  Absolutely not
[10:45.720 --> 10:50.280]  After many generation is possible to count cut away
[10:50.720 --> 10:59.160]  All the results that are negative in your selection. So our idea was to my idea was to select
[11:00.160 --> 11:02.160]  The
[11:02.480 --> 11:10.120]  BT gene more dysfunctional as possible in order to have something that at full ripen
[11:12.520 --> 11:14.520]  Stay under
[11:14.560 --> 11:18.320]  Those levels, you know in Italy we have 0.6
[11:18.840 --> 11:25.120]  So it's already better. It's better. It's much better because give us the chance
[11:26.000 --> 11:30.520]  To try and try and to make a lot of mistakes, you know, right
[11:31.240 --> 11:34.800]  Yeah, and you get fluctuations one plant to another plant
[11:34.800 --> 11:42.120]  If you're how many seeds a year like if you're producing a million seeds a year and you grow all million of those seeds out
[11:42.120 --> 11:44.640]  They're gonna test some will test a little hotter or lower
[11:45.640 --> 11:51.160]  As you make batches, so each batch probably has a different overall collective chemotype
[11:51.840 --> 11:58.800]  Absolutely, absolutely. Absolutely is like you say but the the point was is to
[12:00.960 --> 12:02.960]  Use this bottleneck
[12:02.960 --> 12:05.080]  That is this founder effect
[12:05.840 --> 12:09.040]  in order to get down to
[12:10.120 --> 12:16.000]  The synthesis of Delta 90 HC and total THC. This is very difficult
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.960]  This is very hard and takes a lot of generation, you know
[12:19.560 --> 12:23.600]  But it's something it could be done and you think
[12:27.360 --> 12:28.560]  What
[12:28.560 --> 12:34.760]  Is that as the market there for you for that many seeds because I don't I my my daughter
[12:35.200 --> 12:41.520]  Works in cannabis and they grew huge amounts of good CBD flower
[12:41.920 --> 12:44.520]  That that tested right it was perfect
[12:44.640 --> 12:49.720]  But there was just there's just zero market in the United States for it right now and
[12:50.560 --> 12:52.560]  CBD is coming from so many directions
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.920]  Do you think that the future for because I work on strains that are balanced? They're like 8%
[13:00.800 --> 13:01.800]  CBD
[13:01.800 --> 13:04.800]  well one to five percent CBG and
[13:05.680 --> 13:11.280]  11 percent THC so I have some balanced ones. I work with that that grow outside
[13:11.280 --> 13:16.640]  I don't ever use trellises or anything on them because I want to take and have their genetics
[13:17.440 --> 13:19.400]  Like you say you're working for structure
[13:19.400 --> 13:25.580]  I want my genetics so that people can machine plant it with a vacuum seeder. They can walk away let the rain hit it
[13:25.580 --> 13:32.000]  it's drought tolerant and then they come back and machine harvest it and it goes for concentrates for pins or something and
[13:32.360 --> 13:35.960]  And at that point they probably can separate the CBD
[13:36.400 --> 13:41.840]  On one side and the THC on another if they want if you can grow huge amounts of field grown
[13:42.040 --> 13:45.260]  Why would they want to grow stuff with no THC?
[13:46.520 --> 13:51.280]  If they could in the exact same spot get eight over eight percent
[13:51.920 --> 13:55.480]  CBD and then 11 percent THC and another 4%
[13:56.360 --> 13:58.360]  CBG
[13:58.360 --> 14:02.640]  You know I don't know that I'm wondering what what if there's a huge market
[14:02.640 --> 14:09.080]  And I don't even know that the markets out there for for CBD hemp. I know that a lot of people are wanting it but
[14:10.400 --> 14:16.600]  What kind of what kind of volumes do you see out there worldwide because I my world's kind of small I?
[14:17.480 --> 14:19.480]  Think that there is a good market
[14:20.160 --> 14:26.880]  Definitely because you have to think about that those variety that don't have any psychoactive effect
[14:29.200 --> 14:32.360]  Will be more commonly used because
[14:32.640 --> 14:37.920]  It's the alternative of tobacco. Okay. We are we are trying these
[14:39.520 --> 14:43.760]  Having locked up the THC possibility and
[14:44.720 --> 14:49.560]  It's a shame because I love the 101 as you are saying
[14:50.160 --> 14:55.160]  Right and this put us on a new road to try to do something different
[14:56.040 --> 15:00.240]  Also with the some reluctance as you are saying before
[15:00.840 --> 15:02.840]  Right was the same for us
[15:03.080 --> 15:09.680]  But was the unique unique thing that we could do so we try and try and try and we understood that
[15:09.760 --> 15:15.320]  There are two different things that we could do to take down THC level. It's very easy
[15:15.360 --> 15:23.240]  We take down the quantitative side of the variety in order to have at the beginning of the chain of reaction
[15:23.560 --> 15:24.560]  a
[15:24.560 --> 15:30.600]  Small amount of CBG in order to let at the end with not so much CBD
[15:30.760 --> 15:34.000]  But with a very low THC level
[15:34.760 --> 15:41.280]  On the other side after years of work, you know, I think perfectly what I mean
[15:43.400 --> 15:49.480]  You find new directions you find new opportunities new possibilities
[15:50.440 --> 15:52.520]  for example this year
[15:53.520 --> 15:58.360]  Many batch from clients around the world show up show up
[15:59.520 --> 16:01.520]  some really interesting ratio
[16:02.800 --> 16:07.240]  That I don't have advertised so much because I need a much more
[16:08.080 --> 16:09.560]  complete
[16:09.560 --> 16:11.080]  distribution of data
[16:11.080 --> 16:13.320]  Where we get to the point to have?
[16:14.880 --> 16:16.000]  1290
[16:16.000 --> 16:22.240]  So a THC level close to zero point two and more than forty percent
[16:22.520 --> 16:28.120]  Of CBD that was something that I thought was impossible to do
[16:28.760 --> 16:30.760]  so now we are
[16:31.080 --> 16:32.240]  4-0
[16:32.240 --> 16:34.000]  40% or
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  14 14 percent. Oh
[16:36.920 --> 16:42.920]  14-1 to 90 that it's something really really good that we never expect I
[16:43.640 --> 16:49.400]  Cannot say that that in all the population you will find these kind of parameters
[16:49.720 --> 16:56.520]  But we have got strong results on this on some of our mother plant
[16:58.200 --> 17:03.840]  And and this is connected to what I was saying before the founder effect
[17:04.520 --> 17:06.520]  It's something that I understood
[17:07.760 --> 17:09.760]  during the work
[17:09.960 --> 17:16.680]  You choose a single individuals to goes on this reduce genetical variability
[17:16.920 --> 17:20.400]  So in somehow you are destroying the variety
[17:20.920 --> 17:22.400]  but
[17:22.400 --> 17:28.800]  Give you the opportunity if you use the proper techniques of maintaining the equilibrium and the homozygosis
[17:28.800 --> 17:35.600]  So in breeding techniques and out crossing inside the same line in order to have the same
[17:36.040 --> 17:42.200]  vigor of the variety and we get to this point after four or five generation of
[17:42.840 --> 17:47.480]  Double up double the ratio and the cannabinoid content
[17:49.520 --> 17:54.240]  As I said before I wake up every morning because I like what I do and
[17:55.160 --> 18:01.480]  I like to study I like to understand what I'm what I'm doing and what I'm trying to do
[18:02.160 --> 18:04.000]  and
[18:04.000 --> 18:07.000]  How do you do your testing like your sift?
[18:07.720 --> 18:14.280]  As we bring you know breeders know that we do we sift we select and if you say you're selecting for chemotype
[18:14.480 --> 18:20.840]  Do you grow a mature plant and you breed that plant and then do you test that plant and keep the seed on that plant?
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.920]  Separate from every other one or yeah
[18:23.920 --> 18:29.040]  yeah, I do a little bit difference in the sense that I run a small population and
[18:30.160 --> 18:33.800]  I cross it separately with an ancestor
[18:34.800 --> 18:38.360]  Then I look on the results having the seeds already
[18:39.960 --> 18:42.840]  Made in order to choose which are
[18:44.040 --> 18:51.360]  The lines that have to go on in the improvement instead all the other lines that are
[18:53.840 --> 18:58.280]  Part of the original population and keep inside all the variability
[18:58.400 --> 19:04.040]  Have to be reproduced in order to don't destroy the original variety
[19:04.760 --> 19:07.600]  So the maintenance of the variety
[19:08.760 --> 19:10.120]  obviously
[19:10.120 --> 19:12.120]  The test is very difficult
[19:13.040 --> 19:15.040]  especially with this time
[19:15.400 --> 19:18.520]  level of THC because we have a lot of
[19:19.560 --> 19:21.560]  also analytic issue and
[19:22.200 --> 19:24.200]  Better understand also the
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.960]  relationship between the growing condition
[19:28.760 --> 19:35.080]  Respect to the data that we have at the end. It's very important to make a curve of
[19:36.320 --> 19:40.480]  the rising up of the cannabinoids and the secondary
[19:41.240 --> 19:42.720]  metabolites
[19:42.720 --> 19:46.600]  during the flowering period to understand in which
[19:47.960 --> 19:49.960]  situation we are and
[19:50.120 --> 19:52.120]  Situation we are as
[19:53.720 --> 19:56.920]  Chemotype genotype, you know because
[19:58.200 --> 20:05.120]  all those genotypes have a frequency that is a frequency that is in equilibrium with
[20:05.680 --> 20:07.680]  genetic the genome
[20:08.080 --> 20:15.320]  Frequency. Yeah, do you do you test then when you say a small population when I say a small population?
[20:15.520 --> 20:17.840]  I'm talking about a hundred. What?
[20:19.960 --> 20:21.160]  Huh?
[20:21.160 --> 20:24.920]  also 200 or 300 of individuals
[20:25.520 --> 20:27.520]  This is a small
[20:28.160 --> 20:34.280]  Pollinate or are you are you doing only feminized in that breeding? No, I use
[20:36.440 --> 20:39.640]  For I used for many generation a
[20:40.400 --> 20:45.680]  unique a unique or a couple of male and Chester that have certain characteristics
[20:46.680 --> 20:48.680]  That I want to carry on
[20:49.960 --> 20:54.000]  I went on for four or five generation
[20:56.600 --> 20:58.600]  Without making feminized
[20:58.880 --> 21:05.800]  then I made the feminization at the last step in order to separate all the chemotypes and
[21:06.280 --> 21:09.360]  Make something more reliable and more
[21:11.320 --> 21:13.320]  Stable
[21:13.760 --> 21:20.920]  So you have a male a male that's your go-to mother and you basically got a male
[21:20.920 --> 21:24.800]  Mother plant that you cut all your pollinate pollen donors from
[21:25.320 --> 21:27.880]  Yeah, yeah, something like that is not easy
[21:28.920 --> 21:33.440]  Mostly of the time when I'm able to carry them for long period
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.840]  The first thing that I do is to make a major
[21:38.040 --> 21:39.680]  pollen
[21:39.680 --> 21:46.480]  Pickup and to freeze it up in the proper condition in order to have it for a long time
[21:47.880 --> 21:54.000]  Mm-hmm, and then I try to keep it alive, but mostly of the time is very difficult year after year
[21:54.600 --> 22:00.480]  It's possible. I can't keep pollen more than six months and have it. Yes. It's not worth it to me
[22:00.480 --> 22:02.480]  I just make new feminized all the time
[22:03.320 --> 22:07.960]  Yeah, this is what I'm doing now, but to stabilize the variety and
[22:08.520 --> 22:14.380]  separate all the chemotype or all the genotype or the chemotype in order
[22:15.920 --> 22:17.920]  To have something more restrained
[22:19.520 --> 22:22.960]  I've got to do this on regular basis
[22:24.480 --> 22:26.480]  So when you do a batch of seeds
[22:27.800 --> 22:30.220]  Let's say you're doing a batch of feminized seeds
[22:30.900 --> 22:35.900]  You use would I would imagine one one mother and and
[22:36.220 --> 22:38.980]  Reverse that one make a bunch of clones from that one
[22:39.460 --> 22:44.340]  Reverse it and put it on another and then make that a big big batch of seeds
[22:44.340 --> 22:50.100]  And then you do like a small population out of that batch so that you can test overall
[22:50.260 --> 22:52.660]  What you're what you'll get right?
[22:53.180 --> 22:55.180]  Absolutely five thousand at least
[22:56.020 --> 22:59.620]  Five thousand that's a pretty that's like one plant at my house
[23:02.100 --> 23:08.740]  One plant in your house yeah, I get I can get like two to four thousand seeds off a big plant
[23:09.660 --> 23:16.760]  If I do a batch of seeds, and I got you know like I did I'll do like four hundred thousand seeds
[23:17.580 --> 23:23.360]  You know at least I we did a whole bunch of sixty one hundred and twenty thousand runs
[23:23.360 --> 23:29.560]  But you know usually not small runs unless I'm just stair-stepping a line breeding program
[23:29.800 --> 23:31.860]  You know but if I go to sell something
[23:32.820 --> 23:37.880]  With it so much work to have to test it all out. You'd think you'd want to have really big batches
[23:38.680 --> 23:44.520]  Yeah, yeah is what I'm trying to do is what I'm trying to do, but in any case
[23:45.120 --> 23:50.680]  To be reliable on a market of zero point three. It's necessary to make a big test
[23:50.680 --> 23:54.520]  I have the opportunity to work with many farmers
[23:55.240 --> 23:57.240]  That join me in this
[23:57.520 --> 23:59.400]  journey of
[23:59.400 --> 24:04.840]  testing so the testing for us is not so heavy in the sense that
[24:05.720 --> 24:09.240]  Me or those farmers that do the test for me
[24:10.200 --> 24:13.600]  It's running a cultivation with 5,000 you know
[24:14.360 --> 24:20.160]  But we could get the enough data to say something that is clear. You know right
[24:21.200 --> 24:25.020]  I would think if I was spending a buck a seed and buying
[24:25.960 --> 24:31.780]  150 or half a million seeds you know I would want them all out of one batch you know and
[24:34.680 --> 24:38.260]  Monster batches and then test those monster batches
[24:38.260 --> 24:41.480]  And then if you run it and you run a little bit long and it tests hot
[24:41.680 --> 24:47.860]  Then you're gonna have to trash that whole batch and just keep working until you can do monster batches that are within your parameters
[24:48.380 --> 24:51.060]  Exactly exactly it's a long work
[24:53.180 --> 24:55.180]  Long work and you
[24:56.140 --> 24:58.620]  Lose 95% of the time
[24:59.740 --> 25:06.740]  Yeah, I know I know I I work 50 lines at any one time. I've got 50 lines working right now and
[25:07.940 --> 25:10.460]  But I work mainly on THC
[25:11.420 --> 25:13.340]  medicinal CBG
[25:13.340 --> 25:15.420]  THC V different lines like that
[25:15.980 --> 25:22.180]  For commercial quality that they grow mass production that they don't get mold and mildew and bud rot
[25:23.020 --> 25:24.340]  water
[25:24.340 --> 25:29.980]  Retention I guess is an issue now that I'm finding so I we have one that's being studied in a Quebec
[25:30.980 --> 25:33.980]  University that is uses 35% water
[25:34.300 --> 25:38.340]  Then than any other one and it does have some hemp in it from way back
[25:38.340 --> 25:43.780]  I think just looking at it, so it makes sense that some helps with and boy does it grow a taproot?
[25:43.780 --> 25:46.660]  I can grow a three inch stump on it outside
[25:46.660 --> 25:51.640]  And and when you you can't get the taproot out without digging two feet down and getting it out
[25:51.640 --> 25:54.780]  and it's just got layer after layer after layer of
[25:56.180 --> 26:00.860]  Like roots it puts a taproot out and then it sends a layer all the way around the surface
[26:00.860 --> 26:02.060]  And then it goes down a little farther
[26:02.060 --> 26:08.460]  Then there's another layer of it and it's just layer after layer after layer and I never use trellis netting
[26:08.460 --> 26:12.180]  I saw a picture on your website where you had trellis netting and
[26:12.380 --> 26:16.780]  When I was doing my outside strains, I've got some really really long autos
[26:16.780 --> 26:20.540]  I remind me to ask you about autos if you only do photo Ramos
[26:20.540 --> 26:25.000]  But I put them outside and I let them live in the wind. I don't water them
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.460]  I can grow a plant from planting a seed in the ground right here in Edmonton, Alberta
[26:29.460 --> 26:36.060]  Which is like the living on the moon, right? It's very very cold right now. We're below zero. We're gonna drop below zero
[26:36.060 --> 26:38.260]  We're gonna stay that way for the next six months
[26:38.260 --> 26:44.700]  So it's a very unforgiving place and I can plant seed outside. I can grow it all the way up to seven or eight feet
[26:44.940 --> 26:47.540]  It'll it'll produce a big crop and it won't blow over
[26:47.820 --> 26:54.660]  It's got strong stems good and it's still test in the 20s of for THC. And so
[26:55.300 --> 26:57.720]  You know, I wouldn't probably it
[26:58.380 --> 27:05.700]  When the plant is under certain stresses it can open up other genes that it has in it sleeping when you pressure
[27:06.180 --> 27:12.780]  Like so if you run it really dry or let's say you have a lot of pest pressures that plant will turn on defenses
[27:14.300 --> 27:21.180]  Human body if we poison our liver will try to try to change the DNA in a way where it can filter that poison out
[27:21.180 --> 27:23.180]  easier what
[27:24.340 --> 27:31.620]  Absolutely, you're right 100% for example, we have this issue of a leak of air pot there if the plant if the crops is
[27:32.540 --> 27:34.540]  attacked by a cover pads a
[27:35.540 --> 27:37.540]  THC level will rise up
[27:38.060 --> 27:43.140]  Absolutely, because it's not the fan system. It's obvious we try always to
[27:44.020 --> 27:51.500]  For doing this job properly to test the worst condition cases, but there are some condition that I don't accept
[27:51.660 --> 27:57.020]  You know in the sense if you have your crop that is full of a leak of air pads
[27:57.020 --> 28:00.540]  Yeah that are eating flowers like a hell, you know
[28:00.780 --> 28:04.460]  Yeah, you cannot rely on me on THC level because
[28:06.100 --> 28:12.460]  It's not possible for me to do something that work in all the possible conditions
[28:12.700 --> 28:15.300]  It's it's possible to do a good
[28:16.820 --> 28:23.480]  Variety that express in herself at the best in a certain type of conditions
[28:23.900 --> 28:25.900]  Condition are very relevant
[28:26.260 --> 28:28.260]  Yeah
[28:28.260 --> 28:32.140]  It's very relevant it's very relevant to understand
[28:33.740 --> 28:38.180]  That is not possible to don't do nothing in your grow, you know and
[28:38.820 --> 28:42.240]  Pretend to have something that goes right, you know
[28:44.180 --> 28:51.980]  It is possible people plant potatoes and people plant tomatoes and people plant a lot of stuff that they plant outside and they get
[28:52.540 --> 28:58.140]  In an area where it can grow and they don't have to do anything to it except for amend the soil
[28:58.740 --> 29:00.220]  Yeah
[29:00.220 --> 29:06.300]  It's true, but it's something very very very difficult to find because I don't know your expertise
[29:06.940 --> 29:11.020]  But I'm an agronomist and they work in many different
[29:11.820 --> 29:13.220]  fields of
[29:13.220 --> 29:15.220]  production here in Europe and in Italy
[29:16.220 --> 29:22.820]  In the last 10 years things have changed so fast think about just a tiny thing
[29:24.220 --> 29:29.680]  In the area where I am 600 meter to the sea level 10 kilometer far to the sea
[29:31.060 --> 29:32.540]  10 years ago
[29:32.540 --> 29:40.540]  There are some disease that are never came here in all the history, you know, but now things are changing so fast, you know
[29:41.260 --> 29:44.060]  That what's your what's the latitude there?
[29:45.060 --> 29:46.940]  43
[29:46.940 --> 29:48.940]  43 Sal
[29:48.940 --> 29:55.060]  Nor no, yeah. Yeah, so we're set. We're similar latitudes. It seems like
[29:56.100 --> 30:02.660]  You've got a lot. You're a lot hotter though. Wow. Yeah, because we have the mountain on the back
[30:02.740 --> 30:06.820]  that are the maritimes Alps that is a part of
[30:07.900 --> 30:10.460]  the chain of mountain that
[30:11.300 --> 30:15.740]  Separate Italy to the rest of the Europe in the north side of Italy
[30:16.740 --> 30:18.740]  those Alps are
[30:19.860 --> 30:22.320]  Big mountain that get to
[30:23.500 --> 30:29.760]  2,000 3,000 meter high and we are in these unique territory because we have
[30:30.900 --> 30:32.700]  those mountain
[30:32.700 --> 30:38.300]  2,000 3,000 meter high on our back on the north side of us and
[30:38.900 --> 30:45.860]  In the south side we have the Mediterranean Sea so we have something that keep the temperature
[30:46.900 --> 30:51.460]  Really stable that is the big Mediterranean Sea and on the north side
[30:51.460 --> 30:58.060]  We have those high mountain that cover us from the north stream of wind
[30:59.580 --> 31:04.180]  So Italy mostly of the time not always but in many cases
[31:05.820 --> 31:07.900]  Is a
[31:07.900 --> 31:13.220]  Climate, you know, it's something unusual in the soil only soil only or do you use?
[31:14.260 --> 31:16.260]  So what's your soil?
[31:16.660 --> 31:22.300]  I hear that here. We do a lot of talk about natural soil and amendments and
[31:23.780 --> 31:27.500]  Stuff I up here I start with a clay base
[31:27.500 --> 31:31.260]  I mainly have a clay soil and I've amended it and I use a lot of
[31:32.100 --> 31:37.020]  Composted alfalfa and compost and I do organic growing I don't use
[31:37.780 --> 31:39.780]  chemicals
[31:40.100 --> 31:46.260]  What starting soil do you have I I was in Italy before and I saw a lot of red dirt like a dirt with iron
[31:47.260 --> 31:50.860]  Silica and the clay and not a lot of clay like we have
[31:51.700 --> 31:57.140]  No, we have we have clay but is just in some specific area
[31:57.500 --> 32:01.900]  We could say that our soil come from the destruction the
[32:03.100 --> 32:10.420]  Disaggregation of mountains that goes down to the sea. So there is under the surface in the deep soil
[32:11.260 --> 32:13.700]  there is clay obviously then
[32:14.460 --> 32:16.540]  the the upper part
[32:17.260 --> 32:20.260]  Is made of more organic?
[32:21.940 --> 32:23.300]  Soil
[32:23.300 --> 32:26.980]  In my specific case I work on terraces
[32:27.740 --> 32:31.940]  built in the Middle Ages so that those mountain that were
[32:33.180 --> 32:40.340]  That are destroyed and goes down to the sea were contained in this wall of made of stones
[32:41.500 --> 32:45.860]  the soil in my case is a medium
[32:47.420 --> 32:50.780]  Quality soil in the sense that have inside
[32:51.420 --> 32:58.060]  Sand also clay in a part. I don't know how it's called in English. We call it Franco
[32:58.060 --> 33:00.700]  I'm quick. It's a kind of soil
[33:02.460 --> 33:06.820]  That is a good mix between sand clay
[33:07.740 --> 33:09.740]  Yeah, sandy loam
[33:10.220 --> 33:12.220]  sound
[33:12.260 --> 33:14.260]  For for cannabis
[33:14.420 --> 33:17.100]  Absolutely. This was the place where the cannabis was
[33:17.740 --> 33:19.300]  grown for
[33:19.300 --> 33:20.780]  100 years
[33:20.780 --> 33:25.740]  In all my valley where we grow mostly vineyard and olive trees
[33:26.460 --> 33:28.460]  all the
[33:28.700 --> 33:31.220]  bottom side of the valley close to the river
[33:32.020 --> 33:34.020]  where the places where they were
[33:34.660 --> 33:37.660]  Originally, they grow and 1%
[33:39.220 --> 33:44.820]  For thousand years because they use it to feed animals to make ropes
[33:45.540 --> 33:48.900]  Because we sail the sea with the ropes made
[33:49.540 --> 33:56.820]  And then for making the paper that was very important for culture development
[33:57.700 --> 33:59.940]  printing making paper writing
[34:00.740 --> 34:02.380]  was the
[34:02.380 --> 34:04.380]  real we could
[34:04.420 --> 34:07.460]  definitely say that if the culture
[34:08.460 --> 34:15.660]  In a part of it is born in this country was thanks to the presence of the hemp
[34:16.140 --> 34:18.140]  Yeah
[34:19.340 --> 34:23.700]  Hemp all you'd hemp is your middle name. You don't do any THC strains
[34:24.540 --> 34:27.780]  yeah, yeah, I'm doing quite a few because
[34:28.940 --> 34:31.820]  after a long struggle I get the permit to
[34:34.020 --> 34:36.180]  Make different strains and
[34:37.540 --> 34:39.860]  it's something that I started in
[34:40.460 --> 34:48.060]  last year or two and I was working on the 101 because of the my favorite one, obviously and
[34:50.220 --> 34:53.120]  There is quite a lot of work to do
[34:54.020 --> 34:58.860]  But I'm really interesting because after this journey in hemp
[35:00.220 --> 35:01.460]  I
[35:01.460 --> 35:04.180]  Want to try to do something else?
[35:05.180 --> 35:12.020]  Because I'm seeing the wave that is coming already Germany have
[35:12.740 --> 35:14.740]  those days
[35:14.940 --> 35:17.220]  legalized the cannabis for
[35:17.980 --> 35:19.340]  recreational use
[35:19.340 --> 35:25.980]  So the wave is coming and in any case I'm connected to the industry
[35:26.260 --> 35:31.060]  to the industry of the extraction to the pharmaceutical company because
[35:31.860 --> 35:33.620]  developing a
[35:33.620 --> 35:38.300]  professional work on the genetics that is my passion
[35:39.820 --> 35:44.860]  I'm getting involved also in something that was different respect
[35:45.780 --> 35:48.300]  What I am and what I did in my life
[35:49.020 --> 35:54.580]  In the sense that I run a farm. I have all the droves. I'm pretty independent and
[35:55.300 --> 35:57.300]  I work for myself
[35:57.740 --> 35:59.740]  nice nice
[36:00.740 --> 36:03.460]  Smoke do you smoke the flower? That's the
[36:04.140 --> 36:10.780]  Yeah, because we started we started for a smokable flower market. Okay, so this was why
[36:11.420 --> 36:14.700]  We try at the beginning to take down the quantitative
[36:15.460 --> 36:20.620]  side of the cannabinoid content because our interest was the
[36:21.260 --> 36:25.700]  Turpenoids profile and to have something compliant for our market
[36:26.220 --> 36:28.220]  Then during this journey
[36:28.300 --> 36:35.580]  we realized that we were able to make double or triple of these cannabinoid profile and we were
[36:36.020 --> 36:38.020]  approached by
[36:39.020 --> 36:42.820]  Pharmaceutical industry and destruction industry that is at the early beginning
[36:44.460 --> 36:50.780]  But where I really think that our aroma races and our variety pool
[36:51.300 --> 36:53.220]  Could be
[36:53.220 --> 36:55.060]  restored
[36:55.060 --> 36:58.260]  For you know, because that's the point
[36:58.260 --> 37:06.140]  There is something that is related to our culture and our history. We have all these variety pool that have to be
[37:06.900 --> 37:12.820]  Restored in order to have a meaning in the modernity in the modern world. Otherwise, we will lose them
[37:12.820 --> 37:18.260]  we cannot talk about maintenance of something that is useless, you know, and
[37:19.220 --> 37:25.540]  I don't have the capability to maintain all the variety that are in this country that are very very a lot
[37:26.180 --> 37:27.540]  very
[37:27.540 --> 37:30.580]  big number if I don't do something that
[37:31.700 --> 37:33.700]  Give me the economical
[37:34.100 --> 37:37.460]  Opportunity to do that also in a small part, you know
[37:38.540 --> 37:44.460]  So I have to be recording. Where did you get your starting genetics? Because we're all building
[37:45.100 --> 37:46.180]  Somebody
[37:46.180 --> 37:50.220]  Yeah, always always I started my genetics on
[37:51.100 --> 37:54.620]  population of variety of Piedmont that is a region
[37:56.060 --> 37:57.940]  that have the
[37:57.940 --> 38:05.900]  majority part of the variety Italian variety pool and then I tried to get some small batches of
[38:06.060 --> 38:09.860]  these teaching as a purple area that is a variety more of
[38:11.620 --> 38:13.620]  Mountain side of
[38:14.260 --> 38:15.740]  Italian Alps
[38:15.740 --> 38:21.820]  That were was maintained by Swiss breeder and those with seed producer
[38:22.220 --> 38:25.180]  but the interesting side is that
[38:26.340 --> 38:27.780]  all
[38:27.780 --> 38:33.260]  Mostly of our variety and our genital was maintained by the government
[38:33.580 --> 38:35.580]  We were so lucky of that
[38:36.140 --> 38:39.740]  because in mostly of the country they lost
[38:40.740 --> 38:44.020]  95% of the genital because no one maintained
[38:45.220 --> 38:50.020]  unfortunately the maintenance of all those variety was done in
[38:51.980 --> 38:53.660]  Different way
[38:53.660 --> 39:01.100]  Respect the modern achievement and the modern necessity that we put inside the variety
[39:01.940 --> 39:04.820]  So we have these raw
[39:05.780 --> 39:07.780]  varieties
[39:07.780 --> 39:09.700]  Where there is inside
[39:09.700 --> 39:13.300]  Mostly of everything, you know from CBD
[39:13.820 --> 39:15.580]  chemotype CBG
[39:15.580 --> 39:20.780]  Chemotype and many many other CBC chemotype and so on
[39:21.980 --> 39:25.220]  but all mixes together and this package of
[39:25.540 --> 39:29.900]  Mixing was done from the government and the places where was maintained
[39:30.300 --> 39:34.140]  Think about that. Italy is a really small country
[39:35.060 --> 39:38.860]  With many different region all divided from
[39:39.700 --> 39:41.700]  mountains piece of sea
[39:42.420 --> 39:44.500]  so unique in their
[39:45.260 --> 39:48.060]  Being closed to the rest of the world
[39:48.740 --> 39:51.140]  so during all those centuries
[39:52.700 --> 39:55.180]  There were so many small variety
[39:55.980 --> 39:58.940]  pure line that were adapted
[39:59.900 --> 40:02.980]  to a certain category of production
[40:03.700 --> 40:07.140]  For ropes for paper for
[40:09.020 --> 40:11.020]  Making food for animals
[40:11.660 --> 40:19.540]  in different climate and in different condition very separate one to the other so we could
[40:20.020 --> 40:22.020]  suppose that at the beginning
[40:23.500 --> 40:25.500]  Of the destruction of the
[40:26.900 --> 40:32.820]  Destruction of our variety pool. We will have very very a lot of variety
[40:32.980 --> 40:35.980]  each single valley, you know as in
[40:36.660 --> 40:38.900]  in a much Alpra dash or those
[40:40.180 --> 40:46.500]  area where the cultivation is historically, you know come from history and from these
[40:47.380 --> 40:50.420]  possibility of a small amount of
[40:51.620 --> 40:55.140]  plant to be grown in a separate environment
[40:55.940 --> 41:01.140]  respect all the rest with no possibility of cross-pollination no possibility of
[41:02.100 --> 41:07.660]  Contamination from other variety from outside. Yeah, so you're saying basically a land race
[41:08.340 --> 41:10.140]  you
[41:10.140 --> 41:17.260]  Gathered land races from from all over then they threw them up in one bag and then they gave you some of that
[41:17.260 --> 41:19.020]  and then
[41:19.020 --> 41:22.100]  you had to go and mine through that bag of
[41:23.540 --> 41:25.540]  scrambled eggs to
[41:25.540 --> 41:32.300]  Yeah, absolutely and is that how you got your different you have various flavors to you have a
[41:33.820 --> 41:38.260]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know I work only on a single population
[41:40.060 --> 41:47.220]  The very oh the single population has various flavors because when I when I read you have like
[41:47.740 --> 41:49.500]  six different names
[41:49.500 --> 41:54.540]  Five of them have the same chemo to kikes the bottom one has a little different chemotype
[41:54.780 --> 41:57.620]  Chemotype but the five ones are identical
[41:57.620 --> 42:02.460]  Are those five different flavors that came from the same line that you went one way with one?
[42:02.580 --> 42:09.500]  Another way with another one in another way because one had the spicy flavor. Another one was more fruity. Another one was more gas
[42:10.180 --> 42:12.180]  We have in our genital
[42:12.820 --> 42:18.020]  all the the Turks related to our fruit and it's I
[42:18.740 --> 42:21.980]  Suppose also related to the environment where they grow
[42:22.700 --> 42:27.620]  Anyway, when we say peach it means that it's smell peach, you know
[42:28.060 --> 42:34.060]  And the orange it smelled orange and all those come from a singular population
[42:34.060 --> 42:37.700]  I work on the same population for five years, you know
[42:38.060 --> 42:44.180]  And then at the end I made those feminized line where I separate
[42:45.540 --> 42:47.780]  the also the terpene profile
[42:48.300 --> 42:51.100]  In order to don't have a mix of lemon
[42:51.660 --> 42:52.740]  orange
[42:52.740 --> 42:55.820]  strawberry and peach all melted together
[42:56.660 --> 43:03.020]  You know and you have to go in the fields and separate them. I did something more
[43:03.780 --> 43:07.300]  respect to the beginning where they were all together and
[43:08.460 --> 43:12.580]  I made those lines that come from the same population
[43:13.380 --> 43:19.820]  So I work to one only variety then after five years of inbreeding of
[43:20.660 --> 43:21.860]  cutting
[43:21.860 --> 43:25.700]  the extreme results of the population or
[43:26.180 --> 43:30.540]  Trying to go to a direction in the selection
[43:31.300 --> 43:34.500]  I'm at the moment. I am
[43:36.100 --> 43:41.940]  In the point where I tasted already all the out crosses that I did
[43:43.220 --> 43:45.220]  with many variety
[43:45.420 --> 43:50.100]  at the beginning with CBG pure variety
[43:51.740 --> 43:53.740]  Because
[43:53.980 --> 43:57.900]  The the the genetical characteristic of those are
[43:58.700 --> 43:59.900]  somehow
[43:59.900 --> 44:02.060]  related to the same genepool, so was
[44:03.140 --> 44:05.140]  Interesting to put them in
[44:06.060 --> 44:13.300]  Inside this genepool and try to do something more balanced between CBD and
[44:13.860 --> 44:15.060]  CBG
[44:15.060 --> 44:18.700]  Mm-hmm, then I decide I don't know that you can ever get those two
[44:18.700 --> 44:22.900]  but I I don't think those two will ever line up you'll always have
[44:23.660 --> 44:25.660]  CBG as about a
[44:26.460 --> 44:30.500]  10% ratio of the other cannabinoids. I've never seen it outside that
[44:32.060 --> 44:34.060]  Like I've never seen
[44:34.220 --> 44:36.220]  We have also
[44:36.220 --> 44:43.140]  We have also pure line of CBD CBG that get only that's all it has it doesn't have CBD in it at all
[44:43.380 --> 44:45.380]  At all at all Wow
[44:45.820 --> 44:51.020]  Is the perugina is a land race from that place that is called the Perugia
[44:52.220 --> 44:55.020]  Was usually grown and selected
[44:56.500 --> 44:58.900]  To make ropes for
[45:00.140 --> 45:02.620]  very tall a lot of girls nothing but
[45:03.620 --> 45:11.100]  Exactly so maybe maybe I'm not sure I wasn't there and I don't have a genetical analysis that prove it
[45:12.780 --> 45:15.820]  Maybe this selection for long fiber
[45:18.980 --> 45:23.660]  Occasionally went in this direction of having pure lines of CBD CBG
[45:24.460 --> 45:28.060]  Then they were mixed up with all the rest all together
[45:28.980 --> 45:30.580]  with the
[45:30.620 --> 45:34.460]  Central Central Italy varieties were a little bit mixed
[45:35.020 --> 45:37.020]  but we have
[45:37.580 --> 45:42.740]  Variety that stain only CBG with no THC no CBD
[45:44.060 --> 45:51.180]  And then if you make seed from that, let's say I bought a thousand seeds. I planted a thousand. I'm not gonna get differentiation
[45:51.180 --> 45:55.380]  They're just gonna stay now 5% What kind of percentage does it do?
[45:56.380 --> 46:04.380]  We could say that the the best one and then the more improved one go around 10 to 12% of
[46:04.780 --> 46:06.780]  CBG and
[46:07.780 --> 46:10.220]  They don't have anything else Wow
[46:12.860 --> 46:15.540]  What does it look like is it a really small bud
[46:16.660 --> 46:18.060]  on it
[46:18.060 --> 46:22.180]  Not so much not so small not so small even big
[46:22.780 --> 46:26.420]  Mostly green it's interesting the tricones
[46:27.260 --> 46:30.500]  Because are very why are really white white?
[46:30.780 --> 46:36.220]  Yeah, yeah, like snow really white like snow and they have these chemical
[46:41.100 --> 46:47.580]  Strange attitude that those tricones fall very easily and could be collected
[46:48.820 --> 46:50.220]  with
[46:50.220 --> 46:51.500]  electromagnetic
[46:51.540 --> 46:53.540]  Nice that's a good plan
[46:53.940 --> 46:58.580]  Yeah, it's a good plan. It's a good plan plan when they figure that out. That'll be a good plan
[46:59.140 --> 47:00.420]  Yeah
[47:00.420 --> 47:07.260]  Every flavor I've noticed that some of the ones that I have CBG if it's like I've grown various
[47:07.620 --> 47:10.740]  Ones out just to see what they are. They have like a certain
[47:11.540 --> 47:14.100]  characteristic peppery flavor that runs
[47:14.620 --> 47:16.220]  in CBG
[47:16.220 --> 47:19.100]  Yeah. Yeah, that's true. They have a
[47:20.100 --> 47:22.100]  Characteristic flavor
[47:22.220 --> 47:25.180]  Then there are some breeders in Europe
[47:25.820 --> 47:29.660]  Very well known that are doing things
[47:30.380 --> 47:32.740]  interesting on those variety
[47:34.340 --> 47:38.300]  Giving them the capability to have like strawberry
[47:38.980 --> 47:40.460]  herbs and
[47:40.460 --> 47:45.140]  Flavor, so I think that also those variety will be improved for sure
[47:45.740 --> 47:47.740]  it's interesting because
[47:47.980 --> 47:54.380]  Those variety have blocked all the process, you know of production of cannabinoids
[47:56.420 --> 48:04.020]  They get to see me the CBG and they stopped, you know, there's nothing over is
[48:05.140 --> 48:11.500]  Very interesting. What happens if you cross that to something else that that has the
[48:12.500 --> 48:17.460]  Gene that then it just it goes away completely then it's recessive
[48:17.740 --> 48:22.380]  It's pretty responsive. So the first generation you see the dominant one
[48:22.380 --> 48:25.300]  So if you cross it with a CBD or a
[48:25.940 --> 48:33.900]  THC you will see only the THC only the CBD if you goes on in the back crossing and selection the crossing and
[48:33.980 --> 48:41.140]  Selection with the proper parental line that carry the CBG you could get to have a percentage
[48:42.380 --> 48:44.460]  of the population coming out
[48:46.140 --> 48:49.060]  That will show higher level of
[48:50.020 --> 48:51.420]  CBG
[48:51.420 --> 48:53.420]  absolutely
[48:54.020 --> 48:59.420]  Yeah, it's very interesting all these minor are very interesting maybe sometimes
[49:00.220 --> 49:06.940]  Seems to be more study cases, you know that a real opportunity for the industry
[49:07.420 --> 49:11.220]  but more that I goes in to
[49:11.860 --> 49:12.860]  these
[49:12.860 --> 49:16.900]  subject and the stand that they have their own
[49:17.980 --> 49:22.260]  Application fields we are just at the beginning of all of that, you know
[49:22.820 --> 49:29.900]  Mm-hmm, and we are inside this river and we will be carried and we don't know where you know
[49:30.300 --> 49:32.220]  Yeah
[49:32.220 --> 49:35.180]  Try to figure out where we're gonna go. But but sometimes
[49:36.020 --> 49:38.660]  right now in Canada the market is
[49:39.460 --> 49:44.620]  It's not the best, you know, it's not like shooting ducks in a barrel like it like
[49:45.180 --> 49:48.340]  We all thought it was gonna be pretty easy, but it's not easy
[49:49.980 --> 49:57.060]  Me a mess also here. It's a mess the market. I think worldwide it's gonna remain a mess for a while, but
[49:58.180 --> 50:01.660]  Eventually, I think genetics is going to make the difference
[50:01.660 --> 50:07.780]  Like you say you're making something that you're hopeful that will replace the CB or the the cigarette
[50:07.780 --> 50:09.780]  Let's say yeah. Yeah
[50:10.300 --> 50:12.740]  a Marlboro green and it's not
[50:13.260 --> 50:15.260]  It's it's flower
[50:16.340 --> 50:18.340]  Yeah
[50:18.420 --> 50:20.420]  It will come and they'll be able to
[50:22.620 --> 50:24.620]  Harvest it and everything and
[50:25.300 --> 50:30.980]  Indoor I I imagine will will be a thing of the past. I got this right here
[50:31.500 --> 50:33.500]  This plant right here. I
[50:33.940 --> 50:35.940]  planted it out in
[50:36.340 --> 50:38.340]  In
[50:38.380 --> 50:45.260]  July 9th outside here in Canada and it completely finished to this and it's got the most beautiful turps
[50:45.260 --> 50:48.200]  I don't know. It's that it doesn't do it justice
[50:48.200 --> 50:53.180]  But if you can grow stuff like that in three months in a week or two
[50:53.940 --> 51:00.680]  I tell you one story. I tell you one story this summer. I was without water because all my
[51:00.680 --> 51:04.960]  The system that give us the water me and all the other farmers that are here
[51:05.840 --> 51:07.840]  This area was failed
[51:07.840 --> 51:14.320]  And so we were really really sad and we don't know if we have the possibility to plant or not
[51:14.680 --> 51:20.800]  My greenhouses to make seeds and to run test their own source of water
[51:20.800 --> 51:23.720]  so they were safe, but for the
[51:24.840 --> 51:26.840]  outdoor fields I
[51:27.760 --> 51:33.720]  Outdoor fields I wasn't sure to have the water until 15 of July
[51:34.720 --> 51:36.720]  15 of July we
[51:36.800 --> 51:44.040]  Replace the pump. We did all the work that we have to do to have the water and I finally planted I
[51:45.160 --> 51:50.960]  Planted a small amount of plant obviously because we were in a very difficult situation
[51:51.720 --> 51:53.720]  no water for
[51:54.040 --> 51:56.040]  From think about that we had
[51:58.320 --> 52:03.120]  170 millimeter of water in one entire here
[52:04.240 --> 52:07.080]  It's something crazy. Anyway, I
[52:07.600 --> 52:13.520]  Planted those planted very very late. They made a production. That was unbelievable
[52:14.880 --> 52:16.160]  unbelievable
[52:16.160 --> 52:18.160]  You seeded directly to the soil
[52:19.640 --> 52:21.640]  Quite short
[52:21.640 --> 52:23.640]  Yeah
[52:24.120 --> 52:31.840]  Did you did you seed your seed right into no I seeded in a small pot for a week or so and
[52:41.430 --> 52:43.590]  Did do we got a microphone off
[52:46.830 --> 52:52.850]  I think he's going closer. I hear it now
[52:55.430 --> 52:57.430]  Like running over
[53:00.150 --> 53:03.670]  Can you hear me now, yeah, I can hear now
[53:04.590 --> 53:07.810]  Yeah, sorry was the computer failing it was failing
[53:08.790 --> 53:10.790]  the battery oh
[53:10.910 --> 53:12.830]  Yeah
[53:12.830 --> 53:21.590]  Yeah, I I plant them so late and I've got harvest of 500 gram a plant and I was really surprised
[53:22.430 --> 53:25.030]  in a short time to have these
[53:25.550 --> 53:31.670]  Huge production I have to say that the soil where I planted is a
[53:32.030 --> 53:35.670]  Not till soil that I work from 12 years
[53:36.430 --> 53:39.150]  with compost with all the right thing
[53:39.830 --> 53:47.110]  Really well done and you could see it when you plant a small plant 15 of July
[53:47.630 --> 53:49.630]  and
[53:49.990 --> 53:52.190]  You make those kind of harvest
[53:53.190 --> 53:59.710]  You are really happy because also in those so difficult condition where we are working
[54:01.070 --> 54:08.750]  That are changing so fast and we are not able to fix all the problems in so tiny space of time
[54:11.470 --> 54:14.990]  We are very happy of our production absolutely
[54:15.590 --> 54:17.590]  right, yeah, what
[54:17.630 --> 54:22.230]  So what what do you see we're getting close to the end so what what do you see is
[54:23.230 --> 54:27.510]  Hot and new coming up from the from the hemp perspective. I
[54:28.430 --> 54:36.150]  Don't know. I I don't think you could sell hemp to Jameson because he's a big dab guy. I don't think but
[54:36.830 --> 54:38.830]  but what what's gonna be the
[54:39.430 --> 54:43.310]  The big thing in hemp coming coming forward to us. I
[54:44.310 --> 54:52.230]  Don't know I think that extraction uses will be much much relevant in the future
[54:53.430 --> 54:55.430]  especially as volume of seeds
[54:56.750 --> 54:57.950]  because
[54:57.950 --> 55:02.350]  For what I see here in Europe the potential market
[55:02.750 --> 55:07.350]  It's quite big and not explored yet
[55:08.350 --> 55:10.350]  so I think that all the
[55:10.830 --> 55:13.510]  Uses of those variety
[55:14.830 --> 55:19.670]  Are very interesting for these for the CBD line
[55:20.510 --> 55:22.510]  for these double aptitude
[55:23.070 --> 55:24.830]  smokable flower
[55:24.830 --> 55:26.830]  to in order to
[55:26.950 --> 55:29.870]  have those analog of tobacco that are
[55:30.950 --> 55:36.590]  Anyway, interesting and on the other side this possibility of the extraction
[55:36.590 --> 55:43.590]  I think that will be much more relevant in the future because mostly of the potential customers or the
[55:44.310 --> 55:51.070]  potential patient that could enjoy this don't even know that exists in mostly of
[55:52.070 --> 55:56.590]  Europe for example or Italy, of course, but
[55:59.230 --> 56:04.830]  It's not just something that we do the genetics for a specific purpose
[56:05.510 --> 56:12.030]  We understand the purpose is lowly slowly in our lifetime if we are lucky
[56:13.590 --> 56:15.590]  I think that
[56:15.790 --> 56:18.150]  It's necessary to goes on
[56:18.990 --> 56:20.990]  many different direction
[56:21.390 --> 56:23.470]  also related to the
[56:24.550 --> 56:27.590]  Capability that you have to make things right in so many
[56:28.670 --> 56:30.590]  genetics line
[56:30.590 --> 56:32.150]  because
[56:32.150 --> 56:34.150]  there were
[56:34.790 --> 56:38.150]  Possibility of use those variety that we don't know yet
[56:39.390 --> 56:41.390]  This is the the nice
[56:42.710 --> 56:46.350]  Possibility that we have being at the beginning of something
[56:46.670 --> 56:51.950]  Much bigger than us and much bigger of respect the perspective
[56:52.310 --> 56:58.030]  That we could see now of the of the possibility of use it, you know
[56:59.150 --> 57:01.150]  so I think that
[57:02.030 --> 57:04.030]  It's necessary
[57:04.230 --> 57:05.510]  to
[57:05.510 --> 57:07.510]  goes on
[57:08.030 --> 57:10.030]  Studying so much
[57:10.070 --> 57:12.070]  especially the genetics of the population
[57:12.990 --> 57:15.230]  Because we could find interesting things
[57:16.430 --> 57:18.430]  Everything is more
[57:21.110 --> 57:26.790]  Complicated on a side but also give you the tools to understand
[57:27.110 --> 57:29.110]  That
[57:29.590 --> 57:31.590]  In reality there is much more
[57:32.430 --> 57:36.430]  Plasticity, you know, we could change things much more than I would think
[57:37.470 --> 57:38.550]  generally
[57:38.550 --> 57:45.430]  Our work is to maintain and preserve or to keep it like it is to don't change it to don't lose it, you know
[57:46.150 --> 57:48.150]  in reality, I
[57:48.830 --> 57:53.270]  guess that there are much more opportunity and possibility to
[57:54.670 --> 57:56.030]  move
[57:56.030 --> 57:59.750]  from a starting point to our ending point and
[58:00.950 --> 58:04.670]  the capability of the genetics to change himself
[58:05.510 --> 58:09.510]  Respect our necessity is already in history
[58:10.070 --> 58:14.550]  You know, he adapt with us and with our necessity the difference between
[58:15.230 --> 58:22.230]  I don't know hundred years ago or 200 years ago respect now that now we have tools to understand
[58:22.670 --> 58:25.030]  The tools to make things right
[58:26.270 --> 58:27.150]  and
[58:27.150 --> 58:33.990]  science have made huge steps in the last century on the genetics of population and
[58:36.270 --> 58:39.390]  I'm studying a lot and I think
[58:40.670 --> 58:44.950]  That mostly of the application are not understood yet
[58:46.110 --> 58:48.190]  right, but we have
[58:48.430 --> 58:57.630]  We need to preserve all those heirloom races because inside of this genepool and there are all the resources
[58:58.510 --> 59:02.430]  For what come next next and we don't see so
[59:03.070 --> 59:05.070]  every breather when apply
[59:05.550 --> 59:08.590]  The founder effect and the bottleneck
[59:09.550 --> 59:14.190]  bottleneck of the selection have to find his way to keep on
[59:14.190 --> 59:20.990]  Rejected from the selection and to maintain them properly because we don't know
[59:22.190 --> 59:24.190]  Why we will use them?
[59:24.510 --> 59:26.510]  But have a sense
[59:26.830 --> 59:28.830]  to don't
[59:28.910 --> 59:30.910]  Make an erosion
[59:30.990 --> 59:32.990]  of the genepool
[59:32.990 --> 59:34.990]  This is important in my opinion
[59:35.550 --> 59:37.550]  Yeah, okay
[59:37.550 --> 59:39.550]  I think that the gene pool
[59:39.950 --> 59:45.070]  Since the opening of the internet and if you think back just 40 years
[59:45.630 --> 59:48.430]  about how we have access to email and
[59:50.430 --> 59:53.150]  Genetics from Dutch genetics
[59:53.950 --> 59:58.990]  Mexican genetics Thai genetics afghanistan genetics, you know india
[59:59.550 --> 01:00:04.190]  They all have access to email and they have access to
[01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:10.990]  Afghanistan genetics, you know india they all come together with the african genetics and then people go
[01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:16.910]  Oh, this is cool. And they just start banging them together and you wind up getting all these scrambled eggs
[01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:23.390]  And it's it's just such a it's all the genes are out there, but they're all in the same omelet, right?
[01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:26.350]  And so it makes it a bit harder for us
[01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:29.070]  I mean personally I probably will
[01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:35.550]  Anything that's hemp that doesn't have the right metrics i'm i'm sifting those out
[01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:41.630]  They're going away because it's not me. I can see how some people might have a reason to go that way
[01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:46.670]  But each each individual person is like a facet on a diamond
[01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:52.930]  It's like each person stays in their own lane and you're over there in italy protecting those hemp varieties
[01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:58.590]  You know and so they'll be around and then there's people that are doing mexican varieties and some thai varieties
[01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:02.910]  Which I have a lot of and a few african and and I got the old hazes
[01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:05.070]  But i'm not working with those because they're so long
[01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:07.630]  Eight the eight week flower
[01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:13.230]  Is is something that's around to stay it's not going to go anywhere because nobody wants to wait
[01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:18.190]  Around for 14 weeks for their flower to be done and have it as big as a thimble
[01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:21.230]  I'd rather have it be as big as a beer can
[01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:24.830]  And and take eight weeks to finish and be tight and great buds
[01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:31.330]  So there's everybody's got different directions different goals and and i'm glad to know somebody over there sativa creations
[01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:35.710]  in italy, uh, keeping track a part of the genetics and and
[01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:42.830]  Thank you for talking with us today. I hope uh, the people out there got a little education on hemp. I don't know
[01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:48.910]  Uh, it is future cannabis project a lot, you know, and so people are thinking about the future
[01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:53.790]  They haven't just they're not going to quit they're going to keep these genetics. So keep doing what you're doing
[01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.510]  Uh, thank you for coming
[01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.910]  yeah, thank you for coming on the show do you want to uh,
[01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:05.950]  Get uh, say any last things before he he's going to give us a little intro extra and then we'll be done for another week
[01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:08.110]  but uh, uh
[01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:10.670]  Say something to encouraging to the crowd
[01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:13.070]  to the crowd
[01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:15.390]  Yeah, I don't I don't know. Uh,
[01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:22.990]  If you are interesting in trying those variety that we selected and breed for a long time
[01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:26.430]  Catch up catch with up catch up with us
[01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:30.430]  in many different way with instagram follow us
[01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:35.170]  And we will be there to reply to all your questions
[01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:38.750]  I hope that all this work with
[01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:41.550]  Will will be shared
[01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:45.470]  Everywhere in the world in order to keep it safe
[01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:47.870]  for the future
[01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:51.230]  For sure. Well, there you go sativa creations everybody
[01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:56.910]  It's been glad to have another have you on for another week. We're going to have another great week coming up. We got uh,
[01:02:57.290 --> 01:03:00.910]  Atlas seeds coming up. We got uh, kevin jodery coming up
[01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:05.950]  We got a bunch of different people coming up for in the show. So i'm i'm looking forward to you guys
[01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:10.610]  Uh london if you're out there, can you give us a little extra intro?
