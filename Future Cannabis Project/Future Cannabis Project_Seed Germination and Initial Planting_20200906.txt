[00:00.760 --> 00:10.360]  Alright, next round of autos heading over to Tom's house. The Humboldt Seed Company
[00:10.360 --> 00:28.040]  Magic Melon Auto Fem. Boom. So I just...actually these things popped quickly.
[00:28.040 --> 00:40.230]  Let's just make life easy. What's up? What's up taproots?
[00:40.230 --> 02:11.530]  These all...these pretty much all popped. I don't see any ones that didn't pop.
[02:11.530 --> 02:17.730]  That's a good germination rate. 100%. That's a good number. I think there were 12 seeds
[02:17.730 --> 02:23.690]  in there, so I need to make some more solo cups. So, it's a 10 pack, there are actually
[02:23.690 --> 03:12.150]  11 seeds in there, and every single one popped. So, we're just gonna...and another one. This
[03:12.150 --> 03:25.640]  is to feed Tom's voracious weed appetite. I'll give some to other people. A little Magic
[03:25.640 --> 03:38.920]  Melon Auto. Alright, that might be the last one. And that's it. Alright, we got a little
[03:38.920 --> 04:27.450]  soak. And we're pretty much done for the day with you. So, I put all 11 seeds in solo
[04:27.450 --> 04:38.530]  cups. Each cup is just in a tupper mix, which pretty much has no nutrients. And I was gonna
[04:38.530 --> 04:46.610]  inoculate it with some mycorrhizae, but what I realized is that in the non-active side
[04:46.610 --> 04:57.330]  of my compost tumbler, which is the side that I'm not adding new food scraps to...I don't
[04:57.330 --> 05:11.520]  know if you can see...yeah, right there, we got some mushrooms growing. So, I'm just gonna
[05:11.520 --> 05:25.050]  harvest some of this stuff and put it in each solo cup. So, I'm just gonna take this and
[05:25.050 --> 05:38.430]  break it apart. And put a little bit in every cup. Kind of hard with one hand, but anyway,
[05:38.430 --> 06:09.800]  you get the gist. And then I'll put some water in. There's some mycorrhizae. There you got some
[06:10.280 --> 06:24.140]  bugs breaking down the compost. And I'll do a better job once I can use two hands. But there's
[06:24.140 --> 06:37.260]  my fungal activity in a mix that doesn't really have any nutrients in it. So, let's get started.
[06:38.260 --> 06:52.150]  This stuff just smells like rich earth. It's a very satisfying smell. Alright,
[06:52.150 --> 07:34.960]  so I'm just finishing kind of crumbling up the mycorrhizae. Now, I'll just give it all...let
[07:35.000 --> 07:46.380]  you hang out in the shade. So, actually, I'm just gonna put the rest in with my winter squash that
[07:46.380 --> 08:03.650]  I just popped. This is like three quarters of the way composted material. Chicken bone. Put
[08:03.690 --> 08:13.760]  that back in the composter. Actually, we'll just put you...we'll see you when we see you.
[08:13.760 --> 08:25.120]  Anyway, so this is now...has some fungal activity. Keep it moist. Moist, moist baby.
