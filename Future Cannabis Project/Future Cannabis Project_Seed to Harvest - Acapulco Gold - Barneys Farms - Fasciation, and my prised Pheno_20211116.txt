[00:32.190 --> 00:38.350]  Hello and welcome to an episode of Grow It where we're gonna go through the
[00:38.350 --> 00:43.030]  entire start to finish of one of our genetics here at UCanitGrow. I'm super
[00:43.030 --> 00:48.910]  excited this aquapopagold is a stunning plant. I have it saved in my library. I
[00:48.910 --> 00:52.470]  have some more started now and even more down the pipeline. I'm excited to have
[00:52.470 --> 00:55.790]  one now. If you haven't already don't forget to like and subscribe because you
[00:55.790 --> 01:00.470]  know I appreciate it and it keeps us moving forward. You can see at day 23
[01:00.470 --> 01:05.190]  from sprout this aquapopagold is forming up nicely. It has a nice tight internode
[01:05.190 --> 01:10.550]  spacing with beautiful broad leaves. This very strong plant is showing no stress
[01:10.550 --> 01:16.550]  whatsoever and is taking off like a mother. Very much so enjoying it. Let's
[01:16.550 --> 01:55.410]  check it out as we get further on down the vegetative state. We can see clearly
[01:55.410 --> 02:02.290]  at day 32 of veg she is performing nicely. Getting a little bit thick so
[02:02.290 --> 02:06.330]  we're gonna clear that out and clean it up a little bit. You can see on the left
[02:06.330 --> 02:09.650]  here we had one of our plants actually stressed during the cloning process and
[02:09.650 --> 02:17.170]  cause a nice, well not nice but very unique fasciation mutation. So it's a
[02:17.170 --> 02:19.850]  lot of fun to grow. So you'll see a little bit of that in this video so
[02:19.850 --> 02:24.410]  don't miss out. And you can see these plants are taking off well three days
[02:24.410 --> 02:28.410]  before they're gonna switch into flower. I've cloned up from that original mother
[02:28.530 --> 02:54.090]  and made some beautiful cuts here and these have taken off really nicely. This
[02:54.090 --> 02:58.730]  plant is an absolute loot powerhouse. I could take whatever I can give it and
[02:58.730 --> 03:02.690]  it's pushing out really really nice. I've swathed the one on the left and left the
[03:02.690 --> 03:07.770]  plant with the fasciation and flat stem mutation a little bit more. But we cleared
[03:07.770 --> 03:16.290]  off a lot of the lowers. It actually we lost this main fasciated plant top
[03:16.330 --> 03:20.930]  unfortunately due to mold during the drying process but it's pretty typical
[03:20.930 --> 03:25.890]  that happens with these type of things. We do have it saved. We'll see if we get
[03:25.890 --> 03:30.170]  more fasciation mutation later on. I'll let you guys know about that. But I haven't seen
[03:30.170 --> 03:34.890]  anything yet and we have a few plants launching into flower at this point. So no
[03:34.890 --> 03:39.410]  nothing so far. These plants produce excellently regardless. There are four
[03:39.410 --> 03:44.610]  total I pull up to do a comparison and you can see that they are doing well
[03:44.650 --> 03:49.770]  after a heavy defoliation. They are hardly any stress and will perform
[03:49.770 --> 04:07.730]  nicely. And at day 21 of flower we are starting some nice floral development.
[04:07.730 --> 04:13.850]  Lots of plistil clusters, lots of nicely highly developed plant structure. It's
[04:13.850 --> 04:17.410]  looking really good and it's gonna shave out really really nicely. It's got a very
[04:17.570 --> 04:25.250]  kind of it's got a classic cannabis smell kind of stonky and rich. It's a
[04:25.250 --> 04:29.730]  great performing plant. I'm very happy with it. That's why I've kept it in the
[04:29.730 --> 04:32.850]  library. That's why I'm showing it to you right now. So why don't we just sit back
[04:32.850 --> 05:06.350]  and enjoy. And you can see these beautiful plants are starting to stack
[05:06.350 --> 05:11.570]  up very very nicely. We're seeing them in full flower production now. It's on the
[05:11.570 --> 05:16.970]  early end. We're gonna take these plants to 65 days and they do phenomenally. But
[05:16.970 --> 06:12.580]  let's just sit back and watch the magic happen. This is a powerhouse of a plant
[06:12.580 --> 06:17.380]  and a beauty to watch develop and grow. It gets frosty and you're gonna see how
[06:17.380 --> 06:23.300]  well that happens. Just look at this beautiful faciated flower top. I mean
[06:23.300 --> 06:28.940]  stunning. It's unfortunate I didn't get to smoke it but you know what it was a
[06:29.060 --> 06:32.380]  pleasure to grow and as you can see these plants are really starting to
[06:32.380 --> 07:30.900]  thicken up and get frosty. I love it and I hope you enjoy it too. Oh you can see
[07:30.900 --> 07:35.580]  this plant is getting so close to harvest. We're 10 days away right now and
[07:35.580 --> 07:40.260]  it is looking beautiful. The fade is on. The flower is blooming and man the
[07:40.260 --> 07:44.860]  smells are amazing. There's not much that can be said. Let's let the flower speak
[07:44.860 --> 09:43.580]  for itself. All I have to say is it's harvest day.
