[00:06.840 --> 00:08.840]  We live?
[00:08.840 --> 00:10.840]  Alright!
[00:10.840 --> 00:12.840]  Are we live?
[00:12.840 --> 00:14.840]  I believe we are.
[00:14.840 --> 00:16.840]  So let's get it.
[00:16.840 --> 00:18.840]  Alright.
[00:18.840 --> 00:20.840]  Mojo Rosen.
[00:20.840 --> 00:22.840]  It's ready to go.
[00:22.840 --> 00:24.840]  Oh wait.
[00:24.840 --> 00:26.840]  Sorry, wait. They said not yet. Hold on.
[00:26.840 --> 00:32.840]  Let me check on YouTube.
[00:32.840 --> 00:36.840]  Shows me that we're live.
[00:36.840 --> 00:38.840]  Yes.
[00:38.840 --> 00:40.840]  Oh yeah, we are live.
[00:40.840 --> 00:42.840]  What are you all talking about?
[00:42.840 --> 00:44.840]  Are we live?
[00:44.840 --> 00:46.840]  We are live.
[00:46.840 --> 00:48.840]  Excellent.
[00:48.840 --> 00:50.840]  Alright, welcome everybody to my shack.
[00:50.840 --> 00:56.840]  This is my little spot where the magic happens.
[00:56.840 --> 00:58.840]  I had a little panic attack earlier.
[00:58.840 --> 01:00.840]  I was freaking out a little bit because I ran out of duct tape.
[01:00.840 --> 01:02.840]  I had to fix some shit that I had to get done in here.
[01:02.840 --> 01:04.840]  But we got it done somehow.
[01:04.840 --> 01:06.840]  A couple pieces are missing, but we'll get it done.
[01:06.840 --> 01:10.840]  Anyways, I think today we're going to be washing.
[01:10.840 --> 01:14.840]  It was a tough choice, but we're going to be washing monkey berries.
[01:14.840 --> 01:18.840]  Why? Because it's just a wonderful plant.
[01:18.840 --> 01:22.840]  Full of trikes.
[01:22.840 --> 01:24.840]  And I just can't wait to dip in there and start doing the washing.
[01:24.840 --> 01:32.840]  We're going to be doing all of our washing with the straight bore and 55 gallon drums.
[01:32.840 --> 01:34.840]  And we're going to be doing two washes.
[01:34.840 --> 01:36.840]  The first and second wash by hand.
[01:36.840 --> 01:40.840]  And the third wash we're going to be doing with this funky motor that I put together.
[01:40.840 --> 01:44.840]  Some people that have been following have seen what this little gadget is.
[01:44.840 --> 01:48.840]  And you're going to get to see it working hopefully today.
[01:48.840 --> 01:50.840]  We started a little late, so I'm going to try to get it done as soon as possible.
[01:50.840 --> 01:52.840]  So let's get started.
[01:52.840 --> 01:54.840]  Can you be clear in the face and give me two packs of ice?
[01:54.840 --> 01:56.840]  The big ones, please.
[01:56.840 --> 01:58.840]  All right, so check it out.
[01:58.840 --> 02:02.840]  My assistant here, my wife Leah and Sunda from Smokeash.dope.
[02:02.840 --> 02:06.840]  Smokeash.dope is my assistant today.
[02:06.840 --> 02:08.840]  He's learning from us.
[02:08.840 --> 02:10.840]  He's like your apprentice, right?
[02:10.840 --> 02:12.840]  Can we call him?
[02:12.840 --> 02:14.840]  He's like your apprentice.
[02:14.840 --> 02:16.840]  He's my friend, but my apprentice as well.
[02:16.840 --> 02:18.840]  Excellent.
[02:18.840 --> 02:20.840]  What's his Instagram?
[02:20.840 --> 02:22.840]  Smokeash.not.dope.
[02:22.840 --> 02:24.840]  Just like it sounds.
[02:24.840 --> 02:26.840]  And I wanted to show you this fresh frozen material.
[02:26.840 --> 02:28.840]  Oh, I'm dropping a couple of buds.
[02:28.840 --> 02:30.840]  That's it.
[02:30.840 --> 02:32.840]  That's it.
[02:32.840 --> 02:34.840]  That's it.
[02:34.840 --> 02:36.840]  That's it.
[02:36.840 --> 02:38.840]  That's it.
[02:38.840 --> 02:40.840]  That's it.
[02:40.840 --> 02:42.840]  That's it.
[02:42.840 --> 02:44.840]  That's it.
[02:44.840 --> 02:46.840]  Smokeash.not.dope.
[02:46.840 --> 02:48.840]  Smokeash.not.dope.
[02:48.840 --> 02:50.840]  Smokeash.not.dope.
[02:50.840 --> 02:52.840]  N-O-T-E-O-T.
[02:52.840 --> 02:54.840]  Oh, got it, got it, got it.
[02:54.840 --> 02:56.840]  I thought you said dot.
[02:56.840 --> 02:58.840]  All right, everybody ignore that one.
[02:58.840 --> 03:00.840]  I got caught now, man.
[03:00.840 --> 03:02.840]  Sorry.
[03:02.840 --> 03:04.840]  We've been smoking bows before this whole thing started.
[03:04.840 --> 03:06.840]  How's that?
[03:06.840 --> 03:08.840]  There it is.
[03:08.840 --> 03:10.840]  That's my wife Leah.
[03:10.840 --> 03:12.840]  I'm supposed to be on social media, but there's just a bunch of bricks out there.
[03:12.840 --> 03:14.840]  You know what I mean?
[03:14.840 --> 03:16.840]  So there you go.
[03:16.840 --> 03:18.840]  This is what we're going to be washing.
[03:18.840 --> 03:20.840]  And we're going to be putting this in the drum.
[03:20.840 --> 03:22.840]  I don't know if you can see the drum from over there, but it's going in there.
[03:22.840 --> 03:24.840]  And here you go.
[03:24.840 --> 03:31.190]  I would say it was like four pounds of material.
[03:31.190 --> 03:33.190]  Probably a curious material.
[03:33.190 --> 03:35.190]  But we did it.
[03:35.190 --> 03:37.190]  We fresh-frozen it.
[03:37.190 --> 03:39.190]  It's a lot of work.
[03:39.190 --> 03:41.190]  It's a lot of work.
[03:41.190 --> 03:43.190]  It's a lot of work.
[03:43.190 --> 03:45.190]  We did it.
[03:45.190 --> 03:47.190]  We fresh-frozen that 70-pound batch.
[03:49.190 --> 03:55.190]  I've always been an open-wash kind of type of guy.
[03:55.190 --> 03:57.190]  I know a lot of people like to use their washing machines.
[03:57.190 --> 03:59.190]  Like I said, I'm not a professional.
[03:59.190 --> 04:05.190]  I'm just an amateur dude that's just making hags to self-medicate.
[04:05.190 --> 04:09.190]  So I'm sure there's 200 billion better ways to do it than me.
[04:09.190 --> 04:11.190]  And I'm learning myself.
[04:11.190 --> 04:17.190]  So if there's any suggestions that I can learn from the pros out there, please bless me.
[04:17.190 --> 04:19.190]  I'm on a budget, though.
[04:19.190 --> 04:21.190]  Keep that in mind, right?
[04:21.190 --> 04:23.190]  So here we go.
[04:29.190 --> 04:31.190]  Basically, we just put a little material in there.
[04:31.190 --> 04:33.190]  Let me get some gloves.
[04:33.190 --> 04:35.190]  And so these are 35 gallons, or what are these?
[04:35.190 --> 04:37.190]  These are 55-gallon drums that they were soy sauce.
[04:37.190 --> 04:42.380]  They were soy sauce 55-gallon drums that bought them on Craigslist for $8.
[04:42.380 --> 04:44.380]  I haggled the guy for five because I bought so many.
[04:44.380 --> 04:49.700]  So he let them go for five.
[04:49.700 --> 04:51.700]  I got a whole bunch of them.
[04:51.700 --> 04:53.700]  I cleaned them up real good, sanitized them, the whole nine yards.
[04:53.700 --> 04:55.700]  I bought them at the store.
[04:55.700 --> 04:57.700]  I got them at the store.
[04:57.700 --> 04:59.700]  I got them at the store.
[04:59.700 --> 05:01.700]  I got them at the store.
[05:01.700 --> 05:03.700]  I got them at the store.
[05:03.700 --> 05:05.700]  I got them at the store.
[05:05.700 --> 05:07.700]  I got them at the store.
[05:07.700 --> 05:09.700]  Let me just clean these guys real quick.
[05:09.700 --> 05:11.700]  These are 45 gallons, letting the water out of these guys.
[05:11.700 --> 05:13.700]  We want to see how clean these are.
[05:13.700 --> 05:15.700]  These guys dry out quick.
[05:15.700 --> 05:17.700]  These guys dry out quick.
[05:17.700 --> 05:19.700]  So we want to put a certain amount of water in the oven,
[05:19.700 --> 05:21.700]  some normale ground water,
[05:21.700 --> 05:23.700]  allow the animals to dry out,
[05:23.700 --> 05:25.700]  the tomatoes to dry out,
[05:25.700 --> 05:27.700]  the ours to dry out,
[05:27.700 --> 05:29.700]  the brothers to dry out,
[05:29.700 --> 05:31.700]  a certain amount of funky stuff,
[05:31.700 --> 05:33.700]  so that they can give you a better early snack.
[05:33.700 --> 05:35.700]  So financially, we're not paying them to dry out,
[05:35.700 --> 05:42.700]  We're going to make a cooler out of this. It's 63 degrees in here. I got two air conditioners.
[05:42.700 --> 05:48.700]  And what we did here, we basically punched two holes, four inches, into this freezer.
[05:48.700 --> 05:59.700]  And we went ahead and put two 5 gallon Home Depot buckets in there, frozen and full of water.
[05:59.700 --> 06:10.700]  We have a straight inline fan. We're going to plug it right in.
[06:10.700 --> 06:18.700]  And this is going to chill the sh** out of this room here in about 20 minutes.
[06:18.700 --> 06:22.700]  You guys want to touch this? Ah, yeah.
[06:22.700 --> 06:31.700]  So this is a little ingenuity. I don't know if this was a free freezer. I'm not saying that you go out there and spend $300 and put a hole in your freezer.
[06:31.700 --> 06:38.700]  If you got an extra one somewhere that you can use, and you got the tools to do it safely, just do it. You know what I mean? Trust me, it'll work.
[06:38.700 --> 06:43.700]  The temperature's going to drop down. Here, watch. It's 63 degrees. We'll see if it works or if it doesn't.
[06:43.700 --> 06:47.700]  If it don't, then I got something.
[06:48.700 --> 06:58.700]  So let's get started. In this drum, I have a bunch of water that I've pre-chilled. It's been sitting in water for a while.
[06:58.700 --> 07:07.440]  I tagged it last time. It was like 40 something degrees.
[07:07.440 --> 07:17.490]  So I'm going to add all this water. Not all of it, but most of it.
[07:17.490 --> 07:26.020]  And this is tap water that you ran through your charcoal filter?
[07:26.020 --> 07:32.020]  I'm glad you brought that up, Pete, because I was just going to say that. Yes, I ran it through my charcoal filter.
[07:32.020 --> 07:41.020]  I ran it through. Although I did clean these jugs, these big 55-gallon drums. I let them sit outside to dry for maybe four hours sitting.
[07:41.020 --> 07:50.020]  And just in that moment that they sat outside and collected dust, I brought the drums back inside, and I rinsed them back up.
[07:50.020 --> 07:57.020]  And I ran that water through a number 73 bubble bag. Just circulated the water in each one of these drums.
[07:57.020 --> 08:06.020]  And it's fairly clear. I don't know where it came from.
[08:06.020 --> 08:13.020]  The drum is basically what happened. I don't know if it's from the air. I don't know exactly where it came from.
[08:14.020 --> 08:25.020]  But there was still in this water. I pumped it through the filter, and I put a 73U at the end of the hose.
[08:25.020 --> 08:34.020]  So maybe it could be something that I missed. I wasn't using a good eye or whatever reason, but here we go.
[08:49.540 --> 08:53.540]  So let's run around a little more.
[08:55.540 --> 09:02.540]  And are you making ice at home in quantity, or are you just buying it from the store?
[09:02.540 --> 09:15.760]  No, sir. I am not, because I just want to get nice purified water. You know what I mean?
[09:15.760 --> 09:20.760]  I want to make sure that my ice is as clean as possible, and I know the ice bag is as clean as possible.
[09:20.760 --> 09:26.760]  So I just don't want to have any contamination when it comes to my hash. I want to try to go as clean as possible.
[09:26.760 --> 09:33.760]  So I'd rather just spend the extra $60-70 on ice to get me some good stuff.
[09:36.760 --> 09:43.760]  And again, this is a do-it-yourself episode, man. I don't have all the big washers, not all the good stuff.
[09:43.760 --> 09:46.760]  Just throw it in the open and I'll throw it in the dishwasher.
[09:48.760 --> 09:52.760]  Sorry, Dirty asked what size bags.
[09:55.220 --> 09:58.220]  These are 20-gallon bags, Craig.
[10:00.220 --> 10:11.220]  These are 20-gallon bags from BC Bubble Map.
[10:11.220 --> 10:16.220]  I wouldn't buy any other bags. Actually, I didn't have the need to buy any other bags.
[10:16.220 --> 10:19.220]  Ever since I bought the first set, they've been great.
[10:20.220 --> 10:29.220]  The first set I got were 5 gallons. I upgraded to the 20 gallons about 6 years ago, and it was great.
[10:30.220 --> 10:40.220]  What I did forget to get, in my closet, in my special place, underneath my shoebox, where I have all my birth certificates and the most valuable stuff in me,
[10:40.220 --> 10:45.220]  right there, right underneath those bags that I make, can you please give me two of those bags?
[10:45.220 --> 10:50.220]  Every Mexican keeps the most valuable stuff in the shoebox. Has anybody noticed that?
[10:50.220 --> 11:02.220]  I have my kids' teeth when I was a kid. It's funny. My mom was like, here we go, here's your teeth. I'm like, all right, mom, cool.
[11:02.220 --> 11:09.220]  I got my teeth, I got my hair, I got my umbilical cord, I got everything in the shoebox, man.
[11:12.220 --> 11:13.220]  Your foreskin.
[11:14.220 --> 11:15.220]  Your foreskin.
[11:17.220 --> 11:18.220]  Right?
[11:19.220 --> 11:30.220]  Anyways, this is the tool of choice. An oar. Straight out, clean. I've only used it for a washing hatch. That's duct tape.
[11:31.220 --> 11:33.220]  I'm just going to go ahead and put the timer.
[11:33.220 --> 11:48.620]  We're going to wash this about five minutes. We're just giving it some time right now to kind of balance out. All this stuff was frozen to keep out of the freezer. You good?
[11:48.620 --> 11:49.620]  All right.
[11:52.620 --> 12:01.540]  Look at that camera work. This guy's a pro.
[12:01.540 --> 12:13.220]  Row, row, row your boat.
[12:13.220 --> 12:16.220]  Gently down the stream.
[12:18.220 --> 12:21.220]  Merrily, merrily, merrily.
[12:22.220 --> 12:24.220]  La, la, la, la, la.
[12:25.220 --> 12:32.090]  So that's probably the hardest thing. I'm going to go on this butt for now.
[12:33.090 --> 12:35.090]  I'm going to take it easy on it now.
[12:42.160 --> 12:46.160]  Now, keep in mind that water is cold as hell.
[12:49.160 --> 12:53.160]  Chilling with water for a long time.
[13:04.050 --> 13:06.050]  I'm getting a little violent there.
[13:13.380 --> 13:14.380]  You still there, Peter?
[13:15.380 --> 13:16.380]  I sure am.
[13:18.380 --> 13:19.380]  All right.
[13:25.480 --> 13:27.480]  People want more singing.
[13:29.480 --> 13:30.480]  What was that?
[13:31.480 --> 13:33.480]  I said people want more singing.
[13:34.480 --> 13:36.480]  Life's about to change.
[13:41.010 --> 13:48.010]  You know, Peter, in my 40-whatever years of age, I kind of forgot after 40, how old I was.
[13:49.010 --> 13:53.010]  I learned that life is too short not to have fun, bro.
[13:54.010 --> 13:55.010]  I try to have fun.
[13:58.010 --> 14:02.010]  You'd be amazed at the stuff that I laugh at sometimes.
[14:03.010 --> 14:09.010]  I agree. Just quickly, Fair Dinkum Australian Weed asked, is that butter or trim?
[14:09.010 --> 14:11.010]  You're throwing everything in there, right?
[14:12.010 --> 14:19.010]  Maybe saving a couple nugs for flour, but most of everything goes in the wash, right?
[14:20.010 --> 14:21.010]  Absolutely.
[14:21.010 --> 14:23.010]  I keep, I've got a little OCD.
[14:23.010 --> 14:24.010]  I keep three of everything.
[14:24.010 --> 14:27.010]  So, I keep three of the three tops, the best ones on top of the plant.
[14:28.010 --> 14:29.010]  You want me to say that three times?
[14:29.010 --> 14:30.010]  Because I will.
[14:31.010 --> 14:37.010]  Anyways, I keep the three biggest tops of the plant and the rest of it goes into the wash.
[14:38.010 --> 14:39.010]  Absolutely.
[14:39.010 --> 14:42.010]  We try to trim most of the leaves, the big fat leaves off.
[14:43.010 --> 14:45.010]  We try to get most of that stuff off.
[14:46.010 --> 14:51.010]  And we try to get as much of the bud off the stem as possible.
[14:51.010 --> 14:54.010]  Try to get all the nodes off the stem as possible.
[14:55.010 --> 14:58.010]  Without trying to disturb most of the tripes, obviously.
[15:00.010 --> 15:01.010]  There is seeds in there.
[15:03.010 --> 15:05.010]  I wasn't able to get all of them, obviously.
[15:07.010 --> 15:09.010]  Bro, bro, bro, you know.
[15:10.010 --> 15:11.010]  Anybody got time?
[15:12.010 --> 15:14.010]  Alright, we got a minute and thirty one.
[15:16.010 --> 15:27.010]  And I like, I mean, honestly, when I was, when I first started doing washes, I was doing the five gallon washes.
[15:28.010 --> 15:32.010]  I don't know if you guys ever seen that little round device.
[15:32.010 --> 15:39.010]  It's just basically like a ball that, it's like a countertop manual washing machine.
[15:39.010 --> 15:40.010]  I forgot what it's called.
[15:41.010 --> 15:46.010]  But I used to wash in those when I used to do five gallon washes.
[15:47.010 --> 15:52.010]  I used to throw all my plant matter in those little circular tumblers that you spin by hand.
[15:53.010 --> 15:54.010]  I forgot the name of them.
[15:54.010 --> 15:56.010]  Jeez, I can't believe I'm having a brain fart.
[15:57.010 --> 16:01.010]  But anyways, I would throw all my plant material in there and just spin it around.
[16:02.010 --> 16:03.010]  And I would wash it.
[16:03.010 --> 16:04.010]  Jeez, I can't believe I'm having a brain fart.
[16:05.010 --> 16:09.010]  But anyways, I would throw all my plant material in there and just spin it around.
[16:12.010 --> 16:16.010]  Just quickly, what was the starting weight of the dry material?
[16:17.010 --> 16:19.010]  I would say maybe about three pounds.
[16:20.010 --> 16:21.010]  Okay.
[16:44.750 --> 16:46.750]  So at this point, I like to look at my butt.
[16:46.750 --> 16:49.750]  Obviously, there's a bunch of stuff that's still clumped up.
[16:50.750 --> 16:51.750]  It hasn't been broken up.
[16:52.750 --> 16:56.750]  We're going to try to work that up with a second beat up on that with ore.
[16:57.750 --> 17:00.750]  But on the third wash, we're going to be using this little paddle machine over here.
[17:01.750 --> 17:02.750]  And that's where the dump is really going to happen.
[17:03.750 --> 17:04.750]  So, excuse me.
[17:05.750 --> 17:06.750]  I had a burp there.
[17:07.750 --> 17:08.750]  That's another one.
[17:09.750 --> 17:10.750]  So I think that's it for this.
[17:15.810 --> 17:16.810]  Yeah.
[17:16.810 --> 17:22.810]  So if you're doing ballpark three pounds, what's kind of your expected yield?
[17:23.810 --> 17:24.810]  Like what are you hoping for?
[17:25.810 --> 17:27.810]  Peter, I'm going to be very honest with you.
[17:28.810 --> 17:32.810]  Luckily, I have no one pushing me or forcing me to report any numbers.
[17:33.810 --> 17:34.810]  I hate numbers.
[17:35.810 --> 17:38.810]  As long as I got a good turn, the stuff is stony, it works for me, bro.
[17:39.810 --> 17:40.810]  I'm not into numbers.
[17:41.810 --> 17:42.810]  I really don't.
[17:43.810 --> 17:44.810]  They fuck me up.
[17:44.810 --> 17:45.810]  But they do.
[17:46.810 --> 17:47.810]  So I really just don't like complicating my life.
[17:48.810 --> 17:55.810]  If it's stony, if I got good enough to share it, and if it's tasty and it's clean,
[17:56.810 --> 18:01.810]  which is the main reason why we're doing this whole thing, clean, then it's good for me, man.
[18:02.810 --> 18:04.810]  And you'll find out.
[18:05.810 --> 18:06.810]  Whoever asked that question, stick around.
[18:07.810 --> 18:08.810]  We'll find out how much we get.
[18:09.810 --> 18:12.810]  That's a dramatic conclusion.
[18:18.390 --> 18:19.390]  Alright, Peter.
[18:20.390 --> 18:21.390]  I'm going to go ahead and take this out.
[18:22.390 --> 18:26.390]  So over here, I'll be doing a battery.
[18:27.390 --> 18:30.390]  I have an old phone, so I might have to be plugging this up here pretty soon.
[18:31.390 --> 18:35.390]  This right here, forget it.
[18:36.390 --> 18:37.390]  What?
[18:38.390 --> 18:41.390]  This right here is a 35-gallon jug.
[18:42.390 --> 18:43.390]  It's got a tap on the bottom.
[18:44.390 --> 18:47.390]  Before, I used to use just a 55-gallon drum.
[18:48.390 --> 18:52.390]  I drilled a 3-8 drill hole on the bottom, and I used to just drip.
[18:53.390 --> 18:59.390]  But we started, I mean, in order to do this inside, I was doing all my washes outside during the rain.
[19:00.390 --> 19:02.390]  So this year, we tried to do a little clean room.
[19:03.390 --> 19:05.390]  So we put a spigot on this thing.
[19:05.390 --> 19:13.390]  And basically, this bag lineup here, it's going from 45 all the way up to 220.
[19:14.390 --> 19:18.390]  But the trick is that I always double my 73.
[19:19.390 --> 19:20.390]  Always.
[19:21.390 --> 19:22.390]  Why is that?
[19:23.390 --> 19:26.390]  Because, you'll find out. Stick around.
[19:27.390 --> 19:28.390]  I ain't going to give it up.
[19:29.390 --> 19:33.390]  Basically, there is some material that passes 73 UV.
[19:34.390 --> 19:37.390]  You will catch it in the second 73 before it hits your food grade.
[19:38.390 --> 19:43.390]  That's stuff that you can still press, and it's not considered food grade.
[19:44.390 --> 19:47.390]  So, you'll find out. Let's find out.
[19:50.390 --> 19:52.390]  Is this even working? Is this working a little bit?
[19:53.390 --> 19:54.390]  Here we go.
[19:56.390 --> 19:58.390]  I'm going to pour this right into the bag.
[20:10.880 --> 20:12.880]  I like to do everything manually, bro.
[20:13.880 --> 20:16.880]  Like I said, this is a labor of love. I don't mind getting dirty.
[20:17.880 --> 20:21.880]  A bucket, trust me. I lift my wife all the time.
[20:26.880 --> 20:30.880]  So with this year's harvest, how many washes do you think you'll do?
[20:30.880 --> 20:35.880]  If this is one, are you going to do three, five, ten?
[20:37.880 --> 20:41.150]  Well, on this one, I might just do three washes.
[20:42.150 --> 20:44.150]  We'll find out.
[20:49.150 --> 20:53.150]  And get down to how many heads are being left behind.
[20:54.150 --> 20:58.150]  And then we'll find out. If we have to stay up all night and keep washing, we'll continue to wash.
[20:59.150 --> 21:06.150]  But this little machine will beat it down enough that I won't have to do that many washes.
[21:11.740 --> 21:14.740]  On this particular one, we're going to run everything through the 220.
[21:20.010 --> 21:22.010]  But on the second one, we're going to run by bag.
[21:26.350 --> 21:28.350]  The reason why is because I'm trying to go from that.
[21:29.350 --> 21:43.580]  And when I use my bag, I'm going to try not to agitate as much as I normally will.
[21:44.580 --> 21:46.580]  Of course, I'm going to try to go from that.
[21:47.580 --> 21:50.580]  So I'm going to run it just right through the bag, starting with the 220.
[21:51.580 --> 21:54.580]  I normally would run my material through this bag first.
[21:55.580 --> 21:57.580]  These are the bags that I make. They're Fruit Fly Mesh.
[21:58.580 --> 22:00.580]  They're a little bit bigger than a 220.
[22:03.580 --> 22:08.580]  I've been making them for a while. Actually, a lady down the street sold them to me. I just bought the material.
[22:15.280 --> 22:16.280]  Look, there's stuff all up in there.
[22:24.670 --> 22:30.670]  And when you chop, everything's going straight into the freezer, right?
[22:30.670 --> 22:33.670]  That is correct, here. Right into the freezer.
[22:34.670 --> 22:40.670]  So what happens is I do the rinse that we were talking about with the sodium bicarbonate.
[22:46.670 --> 22:51.670]  I take all the stuff out of the room, and then I dry it with a window down and put it in the freezer.
[22:58.440 --> 23:00.440]  I'm sorry I'm trying to hurry up here.
[23:00.440 --> 23:02.440]  Get all this water transferred over.
[23:07.440 --> 23:18.600]  This is why we bring Sunda here, because he's a big guy and he's going to help me lift all this stuff up.
[23:19.600 --> 23:20.600]  I like to break my back.
[23:22.600 --> 23:23.600]  I'm sorry, Sunda.
[23:25.600 --> 23:27.600]  Anybody has any questions about the water spill right now?
[23:33.300 --> 23:34.300]  Anybody?
[23:34.300 --> 23:35.300]  Are you there?
[23:44.970 --> 23:45.970]  Peter?
[23:47.970 --> 24:02.640]  Seems like I might have lost you.
[24:03.640 --> 24:07.640]  All right, Peter. I don't know if I lost you now, but we're going to continue.
[24:10.640 --> 24:18.470]  Basically, we open the tap down here, and the water's going right through these bags.
[24:18.470 --> 24:20.470]  Yeah, now it's just a waiting game.
[24:22.470 --> 24:27.470]  By the color of the water, it looks like it didn't get agitated that much.
[24:28.470 --> 24:30.470]  There's not that much chlorophyll in there.
[24:31.470 --> 24:36.470]  So I'm hoping we get some nice clean air, and we'll find out what these plants are actually growing.
[24:37.470 --> 24:39.470]  I'm going to go ahead and turn off the tap.
[24:40.470 --> 24:41.470]  I'm going to turn off the tap.
[24:42.470 --> 24:43.470]  I'm going to turn off the tap.
[24:43.470 --> 24:48.470]  I'm hoping we get some nice clean air, and we'll find out what these plants are actually growing.
[24:49.470 --> 24:51.470]  Or what kinds of plants are growing.
[24:52.470 --> 24:53.470]  I've got a finger in the way.
[24:54.470 --> 24:55.470]  You there? Peter?
[24:56.470 --> 24:57.470]  I think I've lost you.
[24:57.470 --> 24:59.470]  My internet's super choppy tonight. Can you hear me?
[25:03.440 --> 25:06.440]  I can hear you, but you're blocking off a lot.
[25:08.440 --> 25:09.440]  Yes, I can hear you.
[25:10.440 --> 25:12.440]  My internet is super choppy right now.
[25:13.440 --> 25:15.910]  All right.
[25:16.910 --> 25:17.910]  All right, guys.
[25:18.910 --> 25:22.910]  Basically, we poured all the water from the drum through these bags.
[25:24.910 --> 25:26.910]  Why don't you guys want to go rinse this entire insect?
[25:28.910 --> 25:29.910]  Or show some of the work.
[25:30.910 --> 25:31.910]  Can you read that? Can you see that question?
[25:37.200 --> 25:38.200]  Do you find the wax?
[25:39.200 --> 25:40.200]  The wax.
[25:41.200 --> 25:42.200]  Makes the glands oxidize.
[25:43.200 --> 25:46.200]  Okay, so we did not use hydrogen peroxide.
[25:47.200 --> 25:57.200]  We used sodium bicarbonate, two cups, lab-grade sodium bicarbonate, two cups of lemon juice, and a 35-gallon container.
[25:58.200 --> 26:00.200]  I scaled it up because I'm using 55 gallons.
[26:01.200 --> 26:02.200]  But that's the formula.
[26:03.200 --> 26:06.200]  I didn't see any degradation in the glands at all.
[26:07.200 --> 26:12.200]  To be honest, there was a bunch of crap that came off these plants.
[26:13.200 --> 26:19.200]  I personally will never run any kind of outdoor material without doing this rinse at all.
[26:20.200 --> 26:21.200]  Period.
[26:21.200 --> 26:22.200]  I just wouldn't.
[26:24.200 --> 26:25.200]  Just because the sheer amount.
[26:27.800 --> 26:31.800]  Like I said in that previous episode that we had when we were talking about my garden.
[26:32.800 --> 26:44.800]  If you just leave the plant for four months and look at the amount that it ends up on your car.
[26:45.800 --> 26:46.800]  I mean, look at the dots.
[26:48.800 --> 26:50.800]  What's happening to these plants, man?
[26:51.800 --> 26:54.800]  So, no, I highly recommend.
[26:55.800 --> 26:57.800]  Seriously, I highly recommend this method of rinsing.
[26:58.800 --> 26:59.800]  We'll find out right now.
[26:59.800 --> 27:01.800]  Last year, I did it with clean water.
[27:02.800 --> 27:06.800]  It worked for me, but I think it was clean enough.
[27:07.800 --> 27:11.800]  So, this year, we're going to go like that.
[27:17.640 --> 27:23.960]  So, over here, Peter, I have a.
[27:25.960 --> 27:26.960]  Maybe you want to do me a favor?
[27:27.960 --> 27:29.960]  On the totally line, there's a yellow bag.
[27:30.960 --> 27:31.960]  So, right here, Peter.
[27:32.960 --> 27:33.960]  So, right here, Peter.
[27:36.960 --> 27:39.960]  I always like to double check my water.
[27:42.960 --> 27:45.960]  I always don't want to throw away any kind of.
[27:47.960 --> 27:49.960]  So, I'm going to run this particular.
[27:51.960 --> 27:53.960]  Water is coming up the bottom here.
[27:54.960 --> 27:57.960]  Again, this is my own crazy way.
[27:57.960 --> 27:58.960]  I have like.
[27:59.960 --> 28:01.960]  What are you in first grade or first and a half grade?
[28:02.960 --> 28:03.960]  I didn't even go to second grade.
[28:06.960 --> 28:07.960]  Seriously, I don't have.
[28:11.960 --> 28:14.560]  For me, my pictures.
[28:16.560 --> 28:17.560]  I hope you learned something from.
[28:18.560 --> 28:20.560]  Our technique and this is what I do.
[28:21.560 --> 28:22.560]  So, I'm going to just go.
[28:23.560 --> 28:25.560]  To 73 without wedding soon.
[28:26.560 --> 28:27.560]  And, of course, this.
[28:34.860 --> 28:37.860]  Already, I already went over five and I can see.
[28:38.860 --> 28:39.860]  That there's nothing there.
[28:40.860 --> 28:42.860]  So, it's safe for me to go ahead.
[28:46.860 --> 28:47.860]  I'm going to dump it right in my.
[28:48.860 --> 28:49.860]  Drum that I have over here.
[28:50.860 --> 28:51.860]  We just got to continue on.
[28:52.860 --> 28:53.860]  Bring in.
[28:54.860 --> 28:55.860]  The water.
[28:56.860 --> 28:57.860]  I'm going to dump it right in my.
[28:58.860 --> 28:59.860]  Drum that I have over here.
[29:00.860 --> 29:01.860]  We just got to continue on.
[29:02.860 --> 29:03.860]  Bring in.
[29:03.860 --> 29:04.860]  The water.
[29:04.860 --> 29:05.860]  The water off.
[29:06.860 --> 29:07.860]  That drum.
[29:09.860 --> 29:11.860]  And the second one we're going to be using the bags.
[29:12.860 --> 29:13.860]  Why is I'm going to beat it up a little more.
[29:14.860 --> 29:17.260]  And these are just basically.
[29:18.260 --> 29:19.260]  Fruit fly mesh.
[29:21.260 --> 29:22.260]  You know.
[29:25.260 --> 29:26.260]  Amazon, becoming false.
[29:27.260 --> 29:28.260]  Just a regular devil.
[29:29.260 --> 29:30.260]  Stitch sewing machine.
[29:30.260 --> 29:32.260]  Can you see that?
[29:32.260 --> 29:33.260]  Yep.
[29:33.260 --> 29:36.260]  Now you see me, now you don't.
[29:36.260 --> 29:39.260]  You still there, Peter?
[29:39.260 --> 29:40.260]  Yep.
[29:40.260 --> 29:46.710]  So how's your day been?
[29:46.710 --> 29:47.710]  Good.
[29:47.710 --> 29:48.710]  Nice episode.
[29:48.710 --> 29:51.710]  Those guys were doing all the Asian stuff.
[29:51.710 --> 29:52.710]  The Thai stick.
[29:52.710 --> 29:53.710]  My sphinx can show.
[29:53.710 --> 29:54.710]  Yeah.
[29:54.710 --> 29:55.710]  Yeah, everyone's doing it.
[29:55.710 --> 30:11.680]  Everyone's giving me a hard time for the internet connection right now.
[30:11.680 --> 30:18.560]  As I said earlier, my connection is choppy right now.
[30:18.560 --> 30:20.320]  You're fading in and out.
[30:20.320 --> 30:21.320]  I know.
[30:21.320 --> 30:24.320]  Why don't you just keep talking?
[30:24.320 --> 30:47.960]  I'm just waiting for all this water to come down.
[30:47.960 --> 30:53.520]  It was about 30 gallons, so it'll take about maybe 10 more minutes.
[30:53.520 --> 30:54.520]  We're going to rush hash.
[30:54.520 --> 31:00.840]  After we take this 220 out, we're going to put it back into the truck again.
[31:00.840 --> 31:06.960]  And then we're going to start washing up the stuff, the hash down, the rest of the
[31:06.960 --> 31:11.240]  bags, starting with the 190 and all the way down to the 220.
[31:11.240 --> 31:12.240]  And see what we get.
[31:12.240 --> 31:13.240]  Hopefully we get something, man.
[31:13.240 --> 31:27.190]  You know, sometimes you get those things that disappoint, but we'll find out.
[31:27.190 --> 31:30.510]  And again, the goal is to get some milk.
[31:30.510 --> 31:34.710]  You want to get some nice clean medicine.
[31:34.710 --> 31:41.590]  Of course, we are thankful to get whatever we can get to sleep.
[31:41.590 --> 32:00.040]  But you know, you want to get the good stuff.
[32:00.040 --> 32:01.040]  Any questions, anybody?
[32:01.040 --> 32:03.240]  We're just waiting for the stuff to drain out.
[32:03.240 --> 32:05.760]  It's getting kind of chilly in here.
[32:05.760 --> 32:10.480]  I'm actually glad that that 60, 61 degrees.
[32:11.480 --> 32:16.480]  The freeze dryer has been running for about two hours.
[32:16.480 --> 32:22.160]  We're getting the temperature down to wherever it needs to be, so we're ready.
[32:22.160 --> 32:26.400]  As soon as this stuff comes in, or comes out, as you say, you can put it in trays and start
[32:26.400 --> 32:28.320]  putting it in the freeze dryer.
[32:28.320 --> 32:32.600]  And whenever we have all of our hash completely done, we'll go ahead and put the rest of the
[32:32.600 --> 32:36.920]  trays, button it up, and save it, forget it.
[32:37.360 --> 32:42.000]  It's the longest time possible for a hash maker.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.360]  This is my second year that I've had a freeze dryer.
[32:44.360 --> 32:46.200]  I didn't have one before.
[32:46.200 --> 32:50.920]  Previously, I just used the old cold air method.
[32:50.920 --> 32:53.600]  It worked for me.
[32:53.600 --> 32:56.600]  The hash was a little darker, but I don't have the dark hash.
[32:56.600 --> 33:02.280]  I mean, to be honest with you, if it's good medicine and it works for me, I mean, it's
[33:02.280 --> 33:04.120]  been working for me for a long time.
[33:04.120 --> 33:05.680]  But at this point.
[33:05.720 --> 33:08.480]  So, this freeze dryer was a blessing.
[33:08.480 --> 33:10.480]  I did a little hustle.
[33:10.480 --> 33:15.840]  I'm not going to tell you what I did, but I hustled this freeze dryer through.
[33:15.840 --> 33:16.840]  And here it is.
[33:16.840 --> 33:17.840]  It's been great.
[33:17.840 --> 33:24.720]  Although, every year I do keep some hash that I do make, and I dry it traditionally.
[33:24.720 --> 33:25.720]  Why?
[33:25.720 --> 33:31.880]  Because I just like the old traditional cured hash.
[33:32.080 --> 33:36.160]  That's what at Smoke Hash Not Dope is all about.
[33:36.160 --> 33:38.000]  It's smoking good quality medicine.
[33:38.000 --> 33:41.120]  It's not about snob color.
[33:41.120 --> 33:44.680]  It's about maturity at trichromes.
[33:44.680 --> 33:49.440]  It's about real medicine, full spectrums, taking it from all the way from the 40s all
[33:49.440 --> 33:51.320]  the way to the tops.
[33:51.320 --> 33:52.320]  Real medicine.
[33:52.320 --> 33:55.320]  So, that's what we're doing here, man.
[33:55.320 --> 33:57.320]  We're self-medicating, but we're doing it.
[33:57.320 --> 34:01.320]  We're trying to concentrate it so that we don't have to smoke so much, obviously.
[34:01.760 --> 34:05.760]  So, are we done?
[34:05.760 --> 34:09.760]  Have you done any dry sifting just for fun?
[34:10.760 --> 34:12.760]  You know, I have.
[34:12.760 --> 34:15.760]  I have done some.
[34:15.760 --> 34:19.760]  Unfortunately, in Southern California, it's not like...
[34:23.380 --> 34:24.380]  What?
[34:24.820 --> 34:30.820]  ...
[34:37.820 --> 34:39.820]  It just becomes the best.
[34:39.820 --> 34:44.820]  So, it's just easier for me to do it this way, hydrate and dry.
[34:44.820 --> 34:46.820]  So, yes, I have.
[34:46.820 --> 34:49.820]  In Mexico, in Michoacan, want to hear a story, Peter?
[34:49.820 --> 34:53.820]  When I was a kid in Mexico, we would put trash bags.
[34:54.260 --> 34:57.260]  I know everybody talks about this story, too, but we did it for real.
[34:57.260 --> 35:00.260]  We would put trash bags on us, put holes on them.
[35:00.260 --> 35:06.260]  We would run through the fields and we would take whatever hash that would stick on our
[35:06.260 --> 35:08.260]  bags.
[35:08.260 --> 35:10.260]  And I was a fat kid, to be honest with you.
[35:10.260 --> 35:15.260]  So, it was easy for me to collect a whole bunch of hash because, I mean, the bag was
[35:15.260 --> 35:16.260]  like, you know what I mean?
[35:16.260 --> 35:21.260]  I would stretch it out and I would be the one fat kid in the back behind the rest of
[35:21.260 --> 35:22.260]  the kids in front of me.
[35:22.700 --> 35:25.700]  And by that time, we had all that hash stuck in our stuff.
[35:25.700 --> 35:29.700]  We would gather all the bags from the two, three kids that we did it.
[35:29.700 --> 35:32.700]  And there was this one local store, they had one freezer.
[35:32.700 --> 35:36.700]  We would put all the bags into the freezer and as soon as we...
[35:36.700 --> 35:37.700]  I mean, we would let it sit.
[35:37.700 --> 35:40.700]  I mean, we were kids, we were drinking Coronas.
[35:40.700 --> 35:43.700]  Back then, it was Estrellitas in Michoacan.
[35:43.700 --> 35:45.700]  I love me some Estrellitas.
[35:45.700 --> 35:46.700]  Oh, boy.
[35:46.700 --> 35:47.700]  I can't...
[35:47.700 --> 35:48.700]  It's bringing back memories.
[35:49.140 --> 35:54.140]  We would crumble up all those bags and it was just straight hash.
[35:54.140 --> 35:56.140]  It would come down.
[35:56.140 --> 36:02.140]  We would bring it up and make little balls and we were hot knifing, man.
[36:02.140 --> 36:05.140]  It was really the thing to do back then.
[36:05.140 --> 36:08.140]  And that's where my passion for hash came from.
[36:08.140 --> 36:11.140]  So, it looks like this is running out.
[36:11.140 --> 36:16.140]  We're going to close the valve and we're going to start taking these bags and that's where
[36:16.580 --> 36:21.580]  the soda comes in and then we're going to take this material, this 220 bag, and we're
[36:21.580 --> 36:23.580]  going to take it back into the mixer.
[36:38.810 --> 36:39.810]  Oops.
[36:39.810 --> 36:40.810]  All right.
[36:40.810 --> 36:44.810]  So, am I on solo now?
[36:44.810 --> 36:46.810]  I have to tell jokes.
[36:48.810 --> 36:50.810]  Can you all see me or am I...
[36:53.340 --> 36:55.340]  Yeah, oops.
[36:57.340 --> 37:02.340]  I like the fat kid in the field story, though.
[37:02.340 --> 37:04.340]  We're working on it, people.
[37:04.340 --> 37:05.340]  Relax.
[37:05.340 --> 37:10.340]  Yeah, I don't know what happened because last week, his connection was pretty good and I
[37:10.340 --> 37:14.340]  asked him how far from the Wi-Fi he was and he said like 20 feet.
[37:16.340 --> 37:17.340]  Yeah.
[37:17.340 --> 37:18.340]  All right.
[37:18.780 --> 37:21.780]  Just for my own sanity, I look and sound okay.
[37:24.630 --> 37:28.630]  Oh, here he comes.
[37:29.630 --> 37:30.630]  He's back.
[37:31.630 --> 37:35.630]  Dude, I tried to run outside and smoke a bong and come back inside before you...
[37:35.630 --> 37:37.630]  And I'm just playing.
[37:39.630 --> 37:45.630]  Just quickly, do you guys have the door closed to where the Wi-Fi is?
[37:45.630 --> 37:47.630]  Maybe open it a crack?
[37:47.630 --> 37:48.630]  I can't, Peter.
[37:48.630 --> 37:49.630]  I'm sorry.
[37:50.630 --> 37:57.630]  This is my little poke room and if I crack it, I mean, I've sacrificed a freezer trying
[37:57.630 --> 37:58.630]  to get this thing open.
[37:58.630 --> 37:59.630]  So, if I crack this thing open...
[37:59.630 --> 38:00.630]  I know.
[38:00.630 --> 38:01.630]  I know.
[38:01.630 --> 38:02.630]  All right.
[38:02.630 --> 38:03.630]  I'm sorry.
[38:03.630 --> 38:04.630]  No worries.
[38:04.630 --> 38:05.630]  We'll chug along.
[38:05.630 --> 38:06.630]  So, everybody appreciate...
[38:07.630 --> 38:08.630]  Everybody's good?
[38:08.630 --> 38:09.630]  How many viewers we got?
[38:09.630 --> 38:10.630]  We're good?
[38:10.630 --> 38:15.630]  Everybody learning something at least or anything at least?
[38:15.630 --> 38:16.630]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:16.630 --> 38:18.630]  No, they're appreciative.
[38:19.070 --> 38:21.070]  We got a couple hundred people tuned in.
[38:21.070 --> 38:22.070]  All right, perfect.
[38:22.070 --> 38:23.070]  Here we go.
[38:23.070 --> 38:31.070]  So, in here, I have basically a sump pump hooked up to a hose spigot and I went and
[38:31.070 --> 38:34.070]  bought a hose at Home Depot and the plating was coming off.
[38:34.070 --> 38:41.070]  So, I went ahead and bought all food grade hosing or hose material and all the fittings
[38:41.070 --> 38:42.070]  are all brass.
[38:42.070 --> 38:44.070]  So, I made sure that everything was cool.
[38:44.070 --> 38:46.070]  I don't want nothing to end up in my hatch.
[38:46.510 --> 38:48.510]  So, I'm going to go ahead and plug it in.
[38:48.510 --> 38:54.160]  Yeah, you can take one of them out.
[38:57.160 --> 38:58.160]  There it is.
[39:06.760 --> 39:09.760]  So, there's two big, huge blocks of bison here.
[39:09.760 --> 39:12.760]  It's been kept in my cold water tank.
[39:12.760 --> 39:13.760]  Cold.
[39:13.760 --> 39:14.760]  I don't know if you can see it.
[39:14.760 --> 39:15.760]  But that water's...
[39:15.760 --> 39:18.760]  Aim it down a little bit.
[39:18.760 --> 39:21.760]  Angle the phone down.
[39:22.760 --> 39:23.760]  You see it?
[39:23.760 --> 39:24.760]  Yep, yep.
[39:26.760 --> 39:27.760]  A light block ice.
[39:31.030 --> 39:34.030]  So, it looks like the 190 doesn't have much at all.
[39:44.110 --> 39:46.110]  We're going to take this bag up.
[39:50.880 --> 39:53.880]  Now, these bags are like four years old or something.
[39:55.880 --> 39:58.880]  I always like to rinse the outside of these bags.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  You see it goes into the next bag.
[40:12.300 --> 40:15.300]  So, for the do-it-at-home...
[40:16.300 --> 40:18.300]  Guys, what I used to use...
[40:18.300 --> 40:19.300]  Bring it up a little bit.
[40:19.300 --> 40:23.300]  What I used to use in the past, I used to use a sprayer pump.
[40:23.300 --> 40:27.300]  I used to fill up the entire sprayer pump with ice.
[40:27.300 --> 40:29.300]  And I would fill it up with water.
[40:29.300 --> 40:31.300]  And I would use that as a sprayer pump.
[40:31.300 --> 40:33.300]  When I first started doing my first washes.
[40:33.300 --> 40:36.300]  And it worked for me if you don't have a sump pump.
[40:36.300 --> 40:38.300]  Or if you have any kind of pump.
[40:39.300 --> 40:41.300]  It just makes it a lot easier.
[40:41.740 --> 40:43.740]  But you really don't need a sprayer.
[40:43.740 --> 40:48.740]  Any kind of water that you can spray any cold water onto these bags will help out.
[40:48.740 --> 40:49.740]  To be honest with you.
[40:49.740 --> 40:52.740]  But a pump does facilitate the work a little bit.
[40:52.740 --> 40:55.740]  So, let's continue here and see what we've got.
[41:00.650 --> 41:03.650]  Sorry, what size is that one?
[41:05.650 --> 41:07.650]  The one we just took was the 190.
[41:09.650 --> 41:10.650]  This is the 160.
[41:10.650 --> 41:11.650]  Got it.
[41:28.360 --> 41:31.360]  I also have this little, small little...
[41:31.360 --> 41:33.360]  I like to use for collecting ash.
[42:01.850 --> 42:03.850]  And we carry this one.
[42:04.850 --> 42:05.850]  It's 190.
[42:17.660 --> 42:18.660]  You guys can see it?
[42:19.660 --> 42:20.660]  Yup.
[42:28.530 --> 42:32.530]  When I went to your episode at Venice Beach.
[42:32.530 --> 42:35.530]  I remember the history of Roslyn with Nikiti.
[42:35.530 --> 42:37.530]  And the rest of the gang.
[42:37.970 --> 42:38.970]  It was really cool.
[42:38.970 --> 42:39.970]  Thank you for the invite.
[42:39.970 --> 42:42.970]  My buddy Eric at Blaze Brands.
[42:43.970 --> 42:44.970]  Yes, Blaze Brands, right?
[42:44.970 --> 42:45.970]  Yeah, Blaze Brands.
[42:45.970 --> 42:46.970]  My buddy Eric.
[42:46.970 --> 42:47.970]  He's the one that brought me over there.
[42:47.970 --> 42:49.970]  Big shout out to my homie.
[42:49.970 --> 42:50.970]  He's a really good friend.
[42:50.970 --> 42:52.970]  He does a lot of good work.
[42:52.970 --> 42:53.970]  Go ahead and give him a follow.
[42:53.970 --> 42:55.970]  Anyways, let's take this out.
[42:56.970 --> 42:58.970]  I learned that the bigger heads...
[43:03.370 --> 43:07.370]  Normally, those 160s, 190s, those are the plumpy heads.
[43:07.810 --> 43:10.810]  And honestly, I'm not really concerned about pretty, man.
[43:10.810 --> 43:11.810]  I'm ugly as it is.
[43:12.810 --> 43:13.810]  You know what I mean?
[43:13.810 --> 43:17.810]  As long as it's self-tasting and it medicates me, that's what I'm going for.
[43:17.810 --> 43:18.810]  You'd be amazed.
[43:23.360 --> 43:24.360]  In terms of medication.
[43:25.360 --> 43:26.360]  So, don't knock it.
[43:27.360 --> 43:28.360]  And be honest.
[43:28.360 --> 43:32.360]  Everybody likes to get those 90s, those 73s, those 120s.
[43:33.360 --> 43:35.360]  But man, here we go.
[43:35.800 --> 43:37.800]  It's not much, but we're going to collect it.
[43:38.800 --> 43:41.800]  Can you aim the camera down a tiny bit so we can see it?
[43:41.800 --> 43:42.800]  Yep.
[43:45.800 --> 43:47.800]  Yeah, there we go.
[43:48.800 --> 43:50.800]  It's a good over-the-shoulder shot.
[43:52.800 --> 43:54.800]  Look at this creative camera work.
[43:55.800 --> 43:57.800]  So, someone asked...
[43:58.800 --> 43:59.800]  Or no, sorry.
[44:01.800 --> 44:02.800]  Someone asked,
[44:03.240 --> 44:05.240]  Someone asked how long you wash for.
[44:06.240 --> 44:07.240]  You said about five minutes?
[44:09.240 --> 44:12.030]  Correct.
[44:12.030 --> 44:13.030]  About five minutes.
[44:14.030 --> 44:19.030]  I normally would wash a little longer, but this particular instance, we're trying to go for milk.
[44:20.030 --> 44:23.030]  Just because we're trying to get something pretty, you know?
[44:24.030 --> 44:27.030]  That's basically the reason why we're getting down to that low of a wash.
[44:28.030 --> 44:31.030]  But I normally will go a little longer, to be honest with you.
[44:31.470 --> 44:32.470]  Alright.
[44:51.250 --> 44:59.700]  So, I'm going to go ahead and give this back to my lovely wife.
[44:59.700 --> 45:01.700]  And she's going to go ahead and rinse it out for us.
[45:01.700 --> 45:02.700]  Thank you very much.
[45:02.700 --> 45:04.700]  We love you long time, baby.
[45:05.700 --> 45:07.700]  Happy wife, happy life.
[45:07.700 --> 45:08.700]  Take some notes.
[45:08.700 --> 45:09.700]  I got to tell you, man.
[45:09.700 --> 45:13.700]  If you take care of your wife, all your problems will go away.
[45:14.700 --> 45:15.700]  Simple as that.
[45:15.700 --> 45:17.700]  You're making her weep.
[45:18.700 --> 45:19.700]  I'm not making her weep.
[45:19.700 --> 45:20.700]  I'm not making her weep.
[45:21.140 --> 45:23.140]  You're making her weed for the year, right?
[45:23.140 --> 45:27.140]  You're making her hash that's going to last her until next season.
[45:28.140 --> 45:29.140]  Absolutely.
[45:29.140 --> 45:33.140]  Luckily, we haven't had to buy zero medicine the entire year.
[45:33.140 --> 45:39.140]  We went through COVID, and we had her, we had hash, and it was great.
[45:39.140 --> 45:43.140]  As a matter of fact, I haven't bought her in 15 years, Peter.
[45:44.140 --> 45:46.140]  So, that's a good thing.
[45:48.140 --> 45:49.140]  That's really a good thing.
[45:49.140 --> 45:50.140]  So, let's go.
[45:50.580 --> 45:51.580]  Can you take us over?
[45:56.860 --> 45:57.860]  All right.
[46:01.520 --> 46:05.520]  And that drum is literally holding all my exit water.
[46:06.520 --> 46:10.520]  All that water is going to be pumped out with the sun pump right into the garden, bro.
[46:12.520 --> 46:13.520]  Nice.
[46:13.520 --> 46:16.520]  Put that lube in, you know, as much as possible.
[46:20.130 --> 46:21.130]  You still there, Peter?
[46:22.130 --> 46:23.130]  I'm still here.
[46:23.570 --> 46:26.570]  As are 250 other people.
[46:26.570 --> 46:27.570]  We're all here.
[46:28.570 --> 46:29.570]  All right.
[46:29.570 --> 46:30.570]  Hang out every word.
[46:33.570 --> 46:34.570]  I'm so sorry, Suda.
[46:35.570 --> 46:37.570]  You just dropped the phone in the bath.
[46:38.570 --> 46:40.570]  I just got soaked in the water.
[46:40.570 --> 46:41.570]  Oh, shit!
[46:42.570 --> 46:44.570]  That would be a tragic end to the phone.
[46:45.570 --> 46:46.570]  Never mind.
[46:46.570 --> 46:47.570]  I'm still here.
[46:47.570 --> 46:48.570]  I'm sorry, Suda.
[46:48.570 --> 46:49.570]  Are you there?
[46:49.570 --> 46:50.570]  All right.
[46:51.010 --> 46:52.010]  Sorry about that.
[46:52.010 --> 46:53.010]  You all right?
[46:53.010 --> 46:54.010]  All right.
[46:54.010 --> 46:55.010]  Here we go.
[46:56.010 --> 46:57.010]  That's the blooper.
[46:58.010 --> 47:06.060]  Luckily, it was the outgoing water.
[47:07.060 --> 47:08.060]  You all right, brother?
[47:09.060 --> 47:10.060]  No.
[47:11.060 --> 47:12.060]  Oh, look at that, bro.
[47:16.000 --> 47:17.000]  This is the 120.
[47:18.000 --> 47:19.000]  I hope.
[47:19.000 --> 47:20.000]  Yeah.
[47:21.000 --> 47:22.000]  There you go.
[47:33.780 --> 47:34.780]  Yeah.
[47:34.780 --> 47:35.780]  Oh, yeah, baby.
[47:36.220 --> 47:39.220]  The reason why I married myself a white woman is because I like blondes.
[47:40.220 --> 47:41.220]  I like my hair blonde as well.
[47:44.220 --> 47:45.220]  Hey, we got 20% battery.
[47:46.220 --> 47:47.220]  We're the white women!
[47:52.220 --> 47:53.220]  OK.
[47:53.220 --> 47:54.220]  There we go.
[47:54.220 --> 47:55.220]  You're back.
[47:57.220 --> 47:58.220]  You there?
[47:59.220 --> 48:02.200]  Yeah.
[48:03.200 --> 48:04.200]  I'm still here.
[48:10.370 --> 48:11.370]  I'm still here.
[48:11.810 --> 48:12.810]  You there?
[48:12.810 --> 48:13.810]  Yeah.
[48:20.240 --> 48:21.240]  I wish we could get better lighting.
[48:22.240 --> 48:23.240]  Suda was using his phone, but.
[48:26.240 --> 48:27.240]  So this is the 120?
[48:28.240 --> 48:29.240]  This is the 120.
[48:29.240 --> 48:30.240]  That is correct.
[48:31.240 --> 48:32.240]  The 90, the 270 degrees are down here.
[48:33.240 --> 48:34.240]  So let's go ahead and collect this.
[48:37.240 --> 48:40.240]  I'm going to rinse this spoon off over here.
[48:41.240 --> 48:42.240]  This is for the spirits.
[48:43.240 --> 48:46.240]  A little bit of 160 is going to go for the spirits.
[48:50.120 --> 48:51.120]  Here we go.
[48:52.120 --> 48:53.120]  Can you see it?
[49:00.320 --> 49:01.320]  Yeah.
[49:16.260 --> 49:17.260]  I think I'm losing you.
[49:18.260 --> 49:19.260]  No, I'm here.
[49:20.260 --> 49:21.260]  I'm here.
[49:21.260 --> 49:22.260]  We're good.
[49:23.260 --> 49:24.260]  We're good.
[49:25.260 --> 49:29.520]  But it looks like we're good.
[49:30.520 --> 49:32.520]  I wish we had better lighting, but there's not so much plant matter in there.
[49:33.520 --> 49:34.520]  So that's a good thing.
[49:35.520 --> 49:50.170]  There's probably 200 professionals watching me say, look at this guy over there making
[49:50.170 --> 49:51.170]  a fool of himself.
[49:51.610 --> 49:52.610]  It works for me, gentlemen.
[49:53.610 --> 49:56.610]  This is my little cocoon, my little backyard, and we're self-medicating.
[49:57.610 --> 49:58.610]  We're in the groove.
[49:59.610 --> 50:03.610]  And I was lucky enough that Peter invited me to showcase my little backyard, my grow,
[50:04.610 --> 50:05.610]  and now we're making hash.
[50:06.610 --> 50:09.610]  So thank you, Peter, once again for allowing me to do this.
[50:10.610 --> 50:11.610]  We'll be pressing next.
[50:12.610 --> 50:13.610]  We're doing the whole process.
[50:14.610 --> 50:15.610]  Let's do it, man.
[50:16.610 --> 50:17.610]  All right.
[50:18.050 --> 50:31.530]  And my lovely wife is going to go ahead and take care of this bag for me.
[50:32.530 --> 50:38.210]  Now, one of the most important things that I always recommend people that are making
[50:39.210 --> 50:42.210]  hash, never procrastinate in cleaning your bags right away.
[50:43.210 --> 50:44.210]  It's truly important.
[50:45.210 --> 50:46.210]  Trust me.
[50:47.210 --> 50:48.210]  I've messed up so many bags.
[50:49.210 --> 50:52.210]  If you do not rinse your bags right away, you're going to be in a heap of trouble.
[50:53.210 --> 50:54.210]  Simple as that.
[50:55.210 --> 50:56.210]  Especially if you're going to be doing a lot of work.
[50:57.210 --> 50:59.210]  So I'm going to go ahead and clean my bags.
[50:59.650 --> 51:02.650]  Especially if you're going to be doing several washes during the same day.
[51:03.650 --> 51:04.650]  Or doing the same...
[51:05.650 --> 51:06.650]  Or...
[51:07.650 --> 51:10.650]  You end up messing up your bags on the first run.
[51:11.650 --> 51:13.650]  So let's not get sidetracked.
[51:14.650 --> 51:15.650]  The 90s in there.
[51:16.650 --> 51:17.650]  Ooh, yeah, baby.
[51:17.650 --> 51:18.650]  Let's get it.
[51:24.060 --> 51:25.060]  Get the oil.
[51:26.060 --> 51:27.060]  A little bit of jerky.
[51:32.020 --> 51:33.020]  You guys are there?
[51:38.660 --> 51:39.660]  All right.
[51:41.660 --> 51:44.660]  Let me check the temperature of the water to make sure it's going all right.
[51:46.660 --> 51:47.660]  What's that?
[51:53.040 --> 51:54.040]  You there, Peter?
[51:55.040 --> 51:56.040]  I'm here.
[51:56.040 --> 51:57.040]  I just got another beer.
[51:58.040 --> 52:02.040]  Yeah, it's...
[52:03.040 --> 52:05.040]  31 degrees, so this water's pretty good.
[52:06.040 --> 52:07.040]  But I'm just going to make sure.
[52:08.040 --> 52:10.040]  I'm going to give it a little mix around.
[52:11.040 --> 52:14.040]  Make sure all that ice gets mixed around in there.
[52:14.480 --> 52:17.480]  I'm going to go ahead and grab one more block.
[52:18.480 --> 52:22.480]  As soon as I go grab one more block of ice, I'm going to throw it in the water supply.
[52:23.480 --> 52:25.480]  Like, once again, this is a shed.
[52:26.480 --> 52:28.480]  Basically, there's no drain.
[52:29.480 --> 52:30.480]  There's no...
[52:31.480 --> 52:32.480]  All I have is electrical.
[52:33.480 --> 52:34.480]  There's no plumbing.
[52:35.480 --> 52:38.480]  Or a sewer or anything like that.
[52:39.480 --> 52:42.480]  So we are doing everything improvised.
[52:42.920 --> 52:45.920]  We're bringing everything in here, chilling it down.
[52:46.920 --> 52:48.920]  However we can possibly.
[52:49.920 --> 52:51.920]  It's the do-it-yourself icebox.
[52:52.920 --> 53:03.920]  In Southern California, people that are doing hash washes in northern states that have the climate that allows them to do it in their...
[53:04.920 --> 53:06.920]  It's just basically open in the backyard.
[53:07.920 --> 53:08.920]  That's just a dream come true.
[53:09.920 --> 53:16.520]  Oh, there's the nice guy.
[53:17.520 --> 53:18.520]  There's the 90.
[53:19.520 --> 53:21.520]  Anybody's got any questions?
[53:22.520 --> 53:23.520]  Anybody out there?
[53:24.520 --> 53:26.520]  Am I boring you?
[53:27.520 --> 53:29.520]  No, no, no. They're digging it.
[53:32.520 --> 53:34.520]  Alright, so let's see that.
[53:37.520 --> 53:38.520]  This is the 90.
[53:58.650 --> 53:59.650]  Here we go.
[54:00.650 --> 54:01.650]  Alright.
[54:03.650 --> 54:04.650]  Smell that?
[54:05.090 --> 54:06.090]  Smell that?
[54:07.090 --> 54:08.090]  Oh, shit. Smell that, bro.
[54:12.160 --> 54:13.160]  Oh, dude.
[54:14.160 --> 54:15.160]  See this?
[54:16.160 --> 54:18.160]  You guys see that, bro?
[54:19.160 --> 54:22.160]  Sort of. The light's kind of blinding it out, though.
[54:22.160 --> 54:23.160]  Did I lose you?
[54:24.160 --> 54:25.160]  I'm here. Can you hear me?
[54:26.160 --> 54:28.160]  Yeah, now I see it. Yep, yep, yep.
[54:28.160 --> 54:29.160]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[54:31.160 --> 54:32.160]  Yep.
[54:35.320 --> 54:36.320]  Trippy lighting.
[54:36.320 --> 54:37.320]  Nice 90.
[54:37.320 --> 54:39.320]  It's not what I thought.
[54:39.760 --> 54:40.760]  Oh, there we go. Yeah, that was good.
[54:40.760 --> 54:42.760]  You had good lighting for a second.
[54:43.760 --> 54:45.760]  Yep. That looks good right there.
[54:53.800 --> 54:58.800]  Big ups to everybody that has big walking coolers and freezers to do their work.
[54:59.800 --> 55:01.800]  It must be badass.
[55:07.840 --> 55:11.840]  Normally, I'm to the middle of winter here in Sallie, California.
[55:11.840 --> 55:14.840]  Mid-January or February to start my washes.
[55:14.840 --> 55:18.840]  But we're running low on turf, so we gotta rush a couple washes.
[55:19.280 --> 55:21.280]  Get some stuff in the pan.
[55:24.070 --> 55:30.070]  I'm gonna go ahead and put these lower microns in the freeze dryer.
[55:31.070 --> 55:34.070]  I have seven trays. This is a pharmaceutical-grade unit.
[55:35.070 --> 55:37.070]  So I'm gonna put those in there to start freezing.
[55:39.070 --> 55:42.070]  That is correct. This is the harvest rack.
[55:45.040 --> 55:47.040]  Alright, let's check out this 90.
[55:48.040 --> 56:14.100]  You still there, Peter?
[56:14.100 --> 56:16.100]  I'm still here.
[56:19.330 --> 56:20.330]  Alright, brother.
[56:21.330 --> 56:24.330]  I'm running out of ideas to talk to you guys.
[56:24.330 --> 56:28.330]  I'm sorry if I'm boring you, but I'm trying to get this done as soon as possible.
[56:28.330 --> 56:30.330]  What the weather permits.
[56:31.330 --> 56:33.330]  I think people just want to see your step-by-step.
[56:34.330 --> 56:37.330]  So you're doing exactly what people want to be watching.
[56:38.330 --> 56:40.330]  Do you spread this out?
[56:42.330 --> 56:44.330]  No, not really, Peter.
[56:44.330 --> 56:47.330]  I really don't. I just throw it right in the freeze dryer the way it is.
[56:47.770 --> 56:56.770]  And when it comes out, I put it in parchment paper and I put it inside Tupperware
[56:57.770 --> 56:59.770]  with little holes drilled on top of the Tupperware lid.
[57:00.770 --> 57:02.770]  The cheapest Tupperware you can get, the zip-lock kind.
[57:03.770 --> 57:11.770]  And I put the Tupperware inside of vacuum-sealed bags.
[57:12.770 --> 57:13.770]  I'm having a quick buffering.
[57:14.210 --> 57:16.210]  Food saver. Thank you, Peter.
[57:17.210 --> 57:19.210]  What'd she say?
[57:20.210 --> 57:22.210]  She just reminded me of the food saver.
[57:23.210 --> 57:29.210]  Bro, this is awesome. Not boring at all. Right on, brother. Thank you.
[57:30.210 --> 57:33.210]  So here we go. We're going to continue to take this 90 off.
[57:42.900 --> 57:46.900]  And in the harvest, right? Is it like 12 to 24?
[57:46.900 --> 57:47.900]  Alright, guys.
[57:48.340 --> 57:52.340]  How long is it going to go in the harvest, right, for?
[57:54.340 --> 57:59.340]  About 24 hours, depending on the batch. The small batch, we'll take that off.
[58:00.340 --> 58:02.340]  Let me show you the 90.
[58:06.340 --> 58:07.340]  You see it?
[58:08.340 --> 58:09.340]  Yep.
[58:10.340 --> 58:11.340]  Peter?
[58:11.340 --> 58:12.340]  Yep, yep.
[58:13.340 --> 58:14.340]  Yeah, buddy.
[58:16.050 --> 58:20.050]  I think we're going to be having some good milk on this one. What do you think, Sunda?
[58:21.050 --> 58:25.050]  Now, Sunda is a hash connoisseur. If anybody doesn't know, this guy knows his shit.
[58:26.050 --> 58:27.050]  Excuse my language.
[58:28.050 --> 58:29.050]  We need battery, guys.
[58:30.050 --> 58:38.510]  Alright, I'm going to put this one in the freeze dryer.
[58:39.510 --> 58:41.510]  And I'll just stagger on one side and the other side.
[58:42.510 --> 58:46.510]  And I just know by looking at the hash if it was run number one or run number two.
[58:47.510 --> 58:49.510]  It's just it comes from experience, I guess.
[58:49.950 --> 58:51.950]  Let's get this hash out of here.
[59:05.830 --> 59:08.830]  Alright, so I got 273s coming up next.
[59:08.830 --> 59:16.830]  And the reason why, like I said, I like to get all the good, pressable hash out before it gets to the food grade.
[59:17.830 --> 59:21.830]  That's basically the main reason why I put 273s in.
[59:22.830 --> 59:24.830]  You'd be amazed at what we catch.
[59:25.830 --> 59:35.830]  Okay, so Pete, your sodium bicarbonate wash right after you chop, what's the purpose of that?
[59:36.830 --> 59:48.290]  The purpose of that is to remove all the dust particles off the plant itself.
[59:48.730 --> 59:55.730]  So we can get all the microbes and most of this shit basically does ash.
[59:56.730 --> 01:00:00.730]  We had a lot of big issues here in Southern California with ash this year.
[01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:09.730]  So that was one of the main reasons why I followed Heavy Ice RX's lead on this particular rinse.
[01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:15.730]  I don't know where he got that idea from, but all I know is that I got the idea from him.
[01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:20.170]  So big credit to the dude in Michigan. He's doing great stuff over there.
[01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:27.170]  I've been following for a while.
[01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:38.170]  And was powdery mildew an issue at all this year?
[01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:43.170]  No, Peter, I didn't have any issues with powdery mildew. I got lucky this year.
[01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:47.610]  I always like to spray my plants with biology.
[01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:51.610]  And this year we sprayed with what we always spray with, Bicellus subtilis.
[01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:57.610]  From the beginning of veg all the way into two weeks into flower.
[01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:03.610]  I was spraying Bicellus subtilis, Juvenia baciana.
[01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:08.610]  I was spraying a little bit of Bt as well for worms.
[01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:12.050]  Not much though. I don't really like Bt a lot.
[01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:18.050]  But no, luckily, Peter, I did not have any issues.
[01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:24.050]  And soon enough here, be my witness, I did not have any powdery mildew at all.
[01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:29.050]  Look at all my posts that I've been putting on my Instagram.
[01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:34.050]  I show it right down. I mean, I zoom in. I want to show you tricks.
[01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:37.050]  So if there was powdery mildew, you're going to see it.
[01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:42.490]  No, Bicellus subtilis is the golden tip, guys.
[01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:53.400]  Look it up. Bicellus subtilis.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:00.400]  Before you invested in the harvest, right, what was your method?
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.400]  I would just air dry.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:12.240]  So basically what I did is I would have window screen.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.680]  Stainless steel window screen.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.680]  And I would open my hash as much as possible.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.680]  I've been seeing in a cave, bro, for 15 years.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.680]  I've been growing in my backyard for 15 years.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.680]  I didn't get outside of the weed world for 15 years or maybe even longer.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:35.680]  So I didn't know about microplaning hash.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.680]  That was all new to me when Glaze Brands told me about microplaning.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.680]  So I didn't know. I really took my hash down piece by piece.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:48.680]  Put it down in the screen.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.680]  And I literally air dried it cold.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.680]  Cold and dry conditions.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.680]  And it worked for me.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.680]  It was darker material, but it was just holistic medicine.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.680]  It was full spectrum.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.680]  Back then I would do the top water siphon.
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.680]  I don't know if anybody's done the top water siphon.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.120]  I would open wash.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:19.120]  And I would literally let all my hash precipitate down to the bottom of the barrel.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.120]  And I would top water siphon from the top.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:27.120]  Without disturbing all the hash on the bottom of the barrel.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120]  And I would top water siphon.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.120]  And I would leave about this much water with the concentrated hash.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:36.120]  And then I would run all that water through all my bags.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.120]  But that was way primitive stuff.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.560]  I didn't watch the full spectrum.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.560]  Sometimes I would just throw everything in the 73.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.560]  And not really care.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.560]  So, soon as somebody tells me, hurry up, the fucking hash is melting.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.560]  It is, bro.
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.560]  Look at that shit, bro.
[01:04:05.410 --> 01:04:06.410]  Looks good.
[01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:08.410]  Yeah, there's the light.
[01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:12.640]  Yeah, buddy.
[01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:44.500]  But yeah, man.
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.500]  Microplane is also a good way to go.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.500]  I know that a lot of people are into it.
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.500]  Gil Gross does it all the time.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.500]  He branded it strong.
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:54.500]  And I got it.
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.500]  It blew my fucking mind, dude.
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.500]  Big ups.
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.500]  Seriously, he got down on that one.
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:02.500]  It's a really good one.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.500]  Not knocking on air drying.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.500]  Freeze drying just makes it easier for me.
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.500]  I have a very short amount of time for me to process all this material.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.500]  So, it works for me, man.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.500]  I know that a lot of people don't like freeze dryers.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.500]  I do.
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:24.040]  But look at that 73.
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.040]  You got it there, Peter?
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.040]  Yep.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.040]  I might be losing you.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.040]  Nah, I'm here.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.040]  There she is.
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:43.980]  Alright, so we're going to take this first 73 out.
[01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:46.420]  Surprisingly, not much in the second 73.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:49.420]  So, that means that all those heads are uniform.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:51.420]  Not a lot of it is passing through.
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:53.420]  So, that's a good thing.
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:55.420]  I didn't beat the shit out of it.
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.420]  So, here we go.
[01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.420]  Let's get this a little bit more action.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.420]  Let's see.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.420]  Hold on one second.
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.420]  Hold on one second.
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:11.160]  That's why it's important to have water on tap.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160]  So important.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.160]  You can rinse all your filters out.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.600]  You can rinse all your filters down.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.600]  And make a little puddle of where your hash is going to be.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.600]  Sometimes I like to put my finger down in the middle.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.600]  Make a little cone so it all comes down to the middle.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.600]  And then obviously I rinse my finger down.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.600]  Yeah, there's some hash still there.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.600]  You see it?
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.600]  But yeah.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.600]  Get that fucking thing out of that freeze dryer again.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.600]  That's three dabs, man.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.600]  I'm taking them.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.600]  Sheer.
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.600]  Sunda's doing a great job here.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.040]  Sunda's doing a great job here.
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.040]  The tray's cold as fuck already.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040]  Shit.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.040]  For the spirits.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.560]  There we go.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:06.870]  You're back.
[01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:08.870]  We're doing live over here, brother.
[01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:12.330]  All right.
[01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:21.240]  Before this water out.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:23.240]  Your wife just got the second 73.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.240]  Yeah, I was saying you're on the two 73s right now, right?
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:30.240]  That is correct.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.240]  The first 73 is the one that's on the water.
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.680]  That is correct.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.680]  The first 73 just came out, Peter, and the second 73 is about to come out.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:42.680]  It seems as this particular cultivar or this particular strand, I'm not going to need it.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.680]  And for what it looks like, I might just eliminate the bigger bags.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:51.680]  I always like to run all the entire set of eight bags on the first run.
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.680]  Obviously, this particular run is just one plant.
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.680]  I'm not going to be running more material of the same strand.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.680]  But if I would have a lot more material, then I would be running more material.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:06.680]  If I were to run on the same strand, I would go ahead and eliminate those bags that are not producing a lot for me.
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.680]  To be honest with you.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:17.680]  I might take the 190 out, leave the 160 or vice versa, depending on how the heads are actually behaving during that wash.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.680]  But yeah, I was finding out that not a lot of stuff on the bigger microns.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.680]  Check out the 73 over here, the second one.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.680]  Not much.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:38.480]  Not much on the second one.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.920]  Not much at all, to be honest with you.
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:50.020]  These bags, man. I put these bags through fucking feedings and they're champs.
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.020]  To be honest with you, man. I like them.
[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.020]  Maybe BC Bubble Man will send me a new one.
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:00.020]  We'll try to get you hooked up.
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:04.020]  You said these ones are about five years old?
[01:09:06.610 --> 01:09:09.610]  Four or five years old. This particular set, yes.
[01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:14.050]  My older five gallons, I bought those in 2002.
[01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:17.050]  I remember, dude.
[01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:19.050]  I sold...
[01:09:20.050 --> 01:09:22.050]  I don't know if I should be saying this in camera.
[01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:32.050]  I sold two units of brick weed to get some money to send to BC Bubble Man to get our five gallon bags back in 2002.
[01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:36.050]  So, BC Bubble Man, we've made your stop with brick weed, bro.
[01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:38.050]  I'm sorry, bro.
[01:09:38.490 --> 01:09:39.490]  But it is what it is.
[01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:51.400]  Dude, back then, I had a three-year-old daughter.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.400]  I was 21 years old or something like that.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.400]  Dude, it was rough.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.400]  And I really had to sacrifice to get those bags, but I did.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.400]  It was a great thing.
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.400]  I learned so much.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.400]  I went live earlier today and we were talking about how we were making cash with brick weed.
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.400]  We didn't have nothing else. We were using minis and stuff like that.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:23.300]  So, back then, we were not growing so much.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:27.300]  Back then, cash was a byproduct of cannabis.
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:37.300]  When I made the switch to make cash a priority of cannabis, not a byproduct of cannabis, that's when good things started happening to me.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.300]  I started getting good results in cash.
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:44.300]  You start using shitty material, you know, you tram all the leftovers, you're kicking all the bugs.
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.300]  You never get to get good stuff.
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.300]  Basically, what oil is down to.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:57.300]  Good material in, good material out.
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.300]  Not much in the second 73.
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.300]  So, I wouldn't have to run this.
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:08.300]  Obviously, this is just one particular plant that I'm doing.
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:12.300]  I'm not doing any more of this strand, but there is some 73 that went through.
[01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:13.740]  That's 4 or 5 dabs.
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:20.360]  If you ask me, I'll take anything.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.360]  That's a fake nail.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.360]  Soon this camera will shine over here.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.360]  You can't believe it got through, huh?
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:36.360]  So, if anything, this 73 ended up in the 45.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.360]  But when you're doing a lot more volume, it obviously makes sense.
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:46.800]  This particular run is not a lot of volume, but I'm taking it.
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:52.500]  Why? Because we can.
[01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:15.610]  So, based on the weather conditions, guys, I think my second wash, I'm going to be waiting until mid, maybe December, February.
[01:12:16.610 --> 01:12:22.610]  I'm not sure, but I definitely need colder weather in Southern California for me to wash the rest of the cultivar.
[01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:26.610]  It's definitely, it was 81 degrees today.
[01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:35.050]  It's not favorable, really, when you're washing this much of a melty material.
[01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:39.050]  It really becomes a hassle.
[01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:41.050]  So, here you go, baby.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.520]  Anybody's got any questions?
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.520]  This is all the seeds that I've been packing.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.520]  People have been talking about neem in the chat.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:58.960]  Do you put neem cake in your soil, and then do you spray with neem oil at all?
[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:05.060]  No, I do not.
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:10.060]  Actually, I do spray with neem oil early in the age.
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:14.060]  I don't like it because the leaves go into shock a little bit.
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:18.060]  I only spray it if I need it, to be honest with you.
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:23.060]  But I like to use a lot of essential plants around the garden.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:27.500]  I spray it with rosemary, almost like a tea.
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.500]  I spray a lot with that.
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.500]  I spray it with a little bit of garlic during veg.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:38.500]  I try to stay as much as possible away from any kind of chemical.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:44.500]  Luckily, I haven't had the need to use any Azomax in my backyard in the past four or five years.
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.500]  Yeah, at least four or five years.
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:49.500]  Yes.
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:56.940]  I remember one time I got a clone from a guy, and it fucked up my entire cultivar.
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:13:59.940]  Anything from inside, outside, it just went ape-shaped.
[01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:03.940]  So I really had to go and spray some Azomax.
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:05.940]  Sorry, that was because...
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.940]  I didn't have the need to do anything like that.
[01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:12.940]  So, JWA helps a lot, man.
[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:17.940]  Peter, I remember last time we were live in the garden, we were talking about
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:22.380]  We were talking about the use of sulfur.
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:28.380]  And I was telling you how I've been hearing a lot of contradictory.
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:33.380]  So it's really good to use soil drenches at the end of the season.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:39.380]  I have not used Jadam sulfur yet, but I might cook up a batch and see what it does for me.
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:45.380]  I'm not saying that I'm having any pressure, but
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:48.820]  It's good to have it ready just in case.
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:50.820]  Here's the 45.
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:54.990]  The dreaded 45 that nobody likes to pick up.
[01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.990]  Just giving it a spray.
[01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.990]  There's some in there.
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.800]  Food grade.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:07.800]  Now, gentlemen.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.760]  My wife has a problem sleeping.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:18.760]  I have a problem sleeping.
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:20.760]  That's the reason why we do this house.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:22.760]  We decarbonize.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.200]  We decarbonize a lot.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:34.200]  We like to put little pill sized pellets of 45.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.200]  You can parchment paper, decarbonize them of whatever temperature.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.200]  It depends on whatever setting.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.200]  Ideally, I'm going to do 220, 240.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:48.200]  Decarbonize the little pellets on parchment paper on a cookie sheet.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.200]  And we eat the hash.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.640]  We eat the hash like a sleeping pill at night.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:58.640]  And you'd be amazed what it does for you guys.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:05.640]  What the fuck is people taking these sleeping pills when you can be freaking eating hash, man?
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.640]  Seriously.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.640]  Leah, you want to say something about this hash?
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.640]  Or are you camera shy?
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.640]  Camera shy!
[01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:22.830]  Here we go.
[01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:24.830]  You see it?
[01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:27.830]  So this is what micron size?
[01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:30.830]  We there, Peter?
[01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:33.830]  Yeah, what micron size are you at?
[01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:35.830]  Hey, he's standing there talking about himself.
[01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:40.830]  Can you hear me?
[01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:47.610]  Alright, he said 45. It's got some in there.
[01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:07.370]  We still there?
[01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:09.370]  I'm still here. Can you hear me?
[01:17:09.810 --> 01:17:13.810]  I don't know if you can hear me or not, but I'm going to try to collect this hash here.
[01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:15.810]  This is a 45.
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.280]  Food grade medicine.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:26.280]  We're going to be making some tres leches cakes or some shit like that with this stuff.
[01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:41.350]  Lighting is really a problem in this room, man.
[01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:45.350]  Lights make it work?
[01:17:52.130 --> 01:18:04.010]  Now the money shot is going to be when this stuff comes out on the free-stir, man.
[01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:06.010]  I can't wait. Really.
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.080]  It really is a team effort right here. We're in close quarters.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.080]  It's not a fat boy friendly environment here.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:34.080]  Sunda's about 6'3 and he's walking around like this the entire time.
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.080]  So big up to Sunda, man.
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.080]  I'm sorry we ended up losing his phone in the end water over there.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:41.520]  I hope the phone is alright.
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:43.520]  Here we go, man.
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:45.520]  That was our first run.
[01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:54.970]  I always like to check in the bottom of the container to see if there's any pass-through hash.
[01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:57.970]  It looks like nothing passed through that 45.
[01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:00.970]  So I won't be running that 25 at all.
[01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:04.970]  If I were to run some more of this material, I wouldn't be running that at all.
[01:19:05.970 --> 01:19:07.970]  This water would simply go right into the flowerbed.
[01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:12.410]  So, that's basically exactly what's going to happen.
[01:19:17.410 --> 01:19:18.410]  Cheats for Sheets of Giggles.
[01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:20.410]  I'm going to put the 73 here.
[01:19:22.410 --> 01:19:29.440]  Alright guys, anybody's got any questions or anything like that?
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:31.440]  Let's go. A joke or anything like that?
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.440]  Ha! Did I lose you, Peter?
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.440]  Yeah, no. Can you see me?
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:39.880]  Can you hear me?
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:41.880]  I can't hear you.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:43.880]  Oh, really? Can anyone else hear me?
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.880]  Hold on. I'm having problems with audio, guys.
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:48.880]  Oh, my God.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:50.880]  Hold on.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.880]  Check. Can you hear me?
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:55.880]  Hold on, guys.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:58.880]  You there?
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.440]  I'm here. Can you hear me?
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.440]  Hold on, Peter.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:10.440]  I'm having technical difficulties here.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:11.880]  Settings.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:14.880]  You there?
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.320]  Yeah, I'm here. Can you hear me?
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.320]  The speaker's not working.
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:25.320]  It's on.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.320]  Check.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:32.110]  Oh, cool. Okay. Everyone else can hear me.
[01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:35.110]  Hold on, Peter. We're having some technical difficulties here.
[01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:38.110]  I always make fun of...
[01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:40.110]  It's funny.
[01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:43.110]  I always make fun of Jeff Loeb.
[01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:46.550]  I always make fun of Jeff Loeb from Team New Microbes.
[01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:51.550]  Because every time he comes in live, he's having a shit fucking show here.
[01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:53.550]  And here we are.
[01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:55.550]  Harlow's a motherfucker.
[01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:57.550]  It's funny.
[01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:59.550]  Stop it.
[01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:01.550]  Plug it in.
[01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:04.550]  So true.
[01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:06.550]  You there?
[01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:09.550]  Yes. Oh, my God. You actually sound much better right now.
[01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:11.550]  Can you hear me, Peter?
[01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.990]  You sound much better.
[01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.990]  I can't hear you at all, brother. I'm sorry.
[01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.990]  I can hear you.
[01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.990]  I can hear you. Can you hear me?
[01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.990]  Can you hear me?
[01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:23.990]  I can't hear you at all, brother.
[01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.990]  Okay.
[01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.990]  Can you hear me?
[01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.990]  All right. I'll just start typing shit.
[01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.990]  I don't know, brother.
[01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:38.990]  I can...
[01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:41.990]  I disconnected you from Bluetooth, so we shouldn't be having any issues.
[01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:43.430]  It should be coming.
[01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:46.430]  You can hear me, but I can't hear you. Speak. Say something.
[01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:48.430]  Check one, two. Check one.
[01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:50.430]  Fuck it. We're just going to go this way, man.
[01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:52.430]  I'm just going to roll with it.
[01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:54.430]  I can't hear you at all.
[01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:56.430]  So hopefully we fix this.
[01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:58.430]  You want to try to check it again?
[01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:05.430]  All right, guys.
[01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:07.430]  So the first set has been run through.
[01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:10.430]  The water is going to go into the bucket.
[01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:11.870]  And I'm just going to go ahead and skip through.
[01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:14.870]  We didn't get a lot of return on the first wash.
[01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:16.870]  So I'm not going to do it with the ore.
[01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:19.870]  I'm just going to go ahead and skip one more wash
[01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:21.870]  and go right into the beat down with the machine.
[01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:23.870]  So let's do it.
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:30.780]  Yeah, he's not even in the thing right now.
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.780]  What did you say?
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:34.780]  He's not going to actually do that.
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:36.780]  We're still having issues with audio.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:47.660]  And I always like to make sure that this material has plenty of audio.
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.660]  So it's going to be a little bit of a spice while it's sitting here.
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:52.660]  I know we've been lamby-ganging a lot.
[01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:55.660]  I normally don't wait this long to wash this material.
[01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:57.660]  But unfortunately, we did.
[01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:01.660]  So maybe outside the big drum, you want to bring it in?
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:03.660]  The thing right there? That one?
[01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:10.130]  Peter, I still can't hear you, man.
[01:23:11.130 --> 01:23:12.130]  I'm sorry, brother.
[01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:14.130]  We're having technical difficulties over here.
[01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:15.570]  I'm sorry.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:36.720]  So.
[01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:44.510]  All right, guys.
[01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:46.510]  We're going to go with the second wash.
[01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:49.510]  And like we said, we're going to run this material.
[01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:51.510]  Right?
[01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:53.510]  One.
[01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:56.510]  One bag of ice.
[01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:58.510]  Just one of the big ones right there.
[01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:05.230]  Pop the pocket iCloud and make audio.
[01:24:06.230 --> 01:24:07.230]  Hold on.
[01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:09.230]  Sundar's going to take care of this real quick.
[01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:11.230]  OK?
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.280]  Audio.
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:24.280]  Microphone.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.280]  I'm sorry, guys.
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:40.440]  The shit show over here.
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:42.440]  It's OK.
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.440]  If you have to leave and come back in.
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:48.600]  I'm sorry, Peter.
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.600]  I'm going to take it, bro.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.600]  OK.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.040]  We're not going to compromise any.
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:04.480]  She doesn't make it in this video at all.
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:06.480]  So the show is going to continue.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:08.480]  I'm going to continue, guys.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:10.480]  My wife is going to try to figure this out.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.800]  They're back.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:18.800]  Hold on.
[01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:20.800]  Just so there's a document.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:22.800]  Just type out the questions and we'll read them.
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:36.250]  OK.
[01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:38.250]  OK.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.800]  OK.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.800]  OK.
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.060]  OK.
[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:07.500]  Just type out the questions and we'll read them.
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:10.500]  What's going on?
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:12.500]  I just slept.
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:14.500]  I'm sorry, Peter.
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.500]  I'm sorry, Peter.
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:18.500]  I can't hear you, man.
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:20.500]  It's going to continue.
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:22.500]  The show's going to continue.
[01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:32.430]  The most important is again.
[01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:38.850]  My fat ass.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:54.640]  At least we don't need that.
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:00.300]  Big ups to my team for helping out.
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:04.530]  We're going to continue.
[01:27:05.530 --> 01:27:06.530]  Just a minute.
[01:27:07.530 --> 01:27:08.530]  A minute.
[01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:10.530]  A minute.
[01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:13.530]  So there she is.
[01:27:14.530 --> 01:27:20.390]  I think I can hear you.
[01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:22.390]  Oh, yeah.
[01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:24.390]  Yeah.
[01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:26.390]  Can you hear me?
[01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:28.390]  All right.
[01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:30.390]  We got to go.
[01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:32.390]  Holy fucking shit.
[01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:34.390]  Excuse my language.
[01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:36.390]  Yeah.
[01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:37.830]  Whoa.
[01:27:38.830 --> 01:27:39.830]  Here we go.
[01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:41.830]  Your wife's a technical genius.
[01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:44.830]  I can't spell.
[01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:46.830]  For the life of me.
[01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:48.830]  I'm just playing.
[01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:50.830]  Well, I don't know what happened.
[01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:54.830]  What happened is we unplugged the Bluetooth speaker for whatever cable and that's what
[01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:56.830]  happened.
[01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:58.830]  So we're back at it.
[01:27:59.830 --> 01:28:03.060]  Here we go.
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:05.060]  OK, so now instead of the.
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:07.060]  Yeah.
[01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:12.500]  So now instead of the the gentle paddle, you're just going savage.
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:16.500]  That is correct.
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.500]  We didn't get a lot of return on the first wash.
[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:20.500]  We didn't beat it up enough.
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:22.500]  The dogs were too big.
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:24.500]  We get enough melt.
[01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:26.500]  We got some melt, but not a lot.
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:28.500]  So I'm just going to go ahead and finish.
[01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:30.500]  It's getting late anyways.
[01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.500]  I got to work tomorrow.
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.500]  A lot of people got to work tomorrow.
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:35.940]  I'm just going to work it really good.
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:39.940]  Give me some nice material so I can press some good material with this next week.
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:41.940]  I can't wait.
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:42.940]  So let's get it done.
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:44.940]  Basically, it's just a propeller.
[01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:46.940]  One 10 motor.
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:48.940]  It's got like a little outboard bracket.
[01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:50.940]  And basically.
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:54.940]  It goes right in the spot.
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:00.980]  Maybe you want to pass me one more bag of ice.
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:02.980]  Yeah.
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:04.420]  I like the entire MacGyver setup.
[01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:10.420]  Dude, this is so improvised for it.
[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:12.420]  For the time of year, I can't believe I'm washing right now.
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:14.420]  Normally I don't wash until.
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:16.420]  Oh, I love it.
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:18.420]  The telltale sign is Halloween.
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.420]  If I'm walking around.
[01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:22.420]  Trick or treating.
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:24.420]  Those are things that it's time to fucking wash the patch.
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:26.420]  But she's like, I'm going to wash the patch.
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:28.420]  I'm going to wash the patch.
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:30.420]  I'm going to wash the patch.
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:32.420]  I'm going to wash the patch.
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:34.420]  I haven't had any niplets, bro.
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:36.420]  So we can't make any good hash.
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:38.420]  Out in the open.
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:40.420]  So we're really been like struggling.
[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:42.420]  Struggling to get this shit done, man.
[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:44.420]  To be honest with you.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:46.420]  I've been itching.
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:48.420]  I've been smoking a lot of doobies for stupid fruits.
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.080]  Past couple days, man.
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:57.140]  Oh, man, it's really good.
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:29:59.140]  Highly recommend that.
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:01.140]  That's trend.
[01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:03.140]  If someone wants to go to the Humboldt C.E.C.
[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:05.140]  For a couple of days.
[01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:07.140]  I highly recommend that.
[01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:11.760]  I'm going to go to the Humboldt C.E.C.
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:13.760]  For a couple of days.
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:15.760]  And.
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:17.760]  Your.
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:19.760]  Your audio is cutting out.
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:22.760]  Can you hear me?
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:24.760]  Hello.
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:26.760]  Hello.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:28.760]  You.
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.760]  Up.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:32.760]  So the important thing.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:34.760]  Is.
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:36.760]  Is.
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:38.760]  Is.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.200]  Yeah, hold on.
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.200]  I think.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.200]  I need.
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:48.940]  Yeah, that's what I thought was going on.
[01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:50.940]  OK.
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:52.940]  So I wasn't imagining he cut out.
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:55.940]  OK, we'll wait for him to come back.
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:30:57.940]  Yeah.
[01:30:58.940 --> 01:30:59.940]  So.
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:01.940]  So.
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:03.940]  So.
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:05.940]  So.
[01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:07.940]  So.
[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:09.940]  So.
[01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:11.380]  So.
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:13.380]  So.
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:14.380]  Yeah.
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:16.380]  That motor.
[01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:17.380]  That thing is savage.
[01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:21.380]  All right.
[01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:23.380]  We'll wait for him to come back.
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:25.380]  In the meantime I got super high.
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.380]  Up.
[01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:29.380]  Look who's back.
[01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:30.380]  All right.
[01:31:30.380 --> 01:31:31.380]  We're back.
[01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:33.380]  We're going to.
[01:31:35.380 --> 01:31:36.380]  All right.
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:38.380]  Make sure you.
[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:39.380]  You don't want to get yourself
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:46.380]  I got you fuckers!
[01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:51.380]  Life's too short to not have fun!
[01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:56.380]  This fucker thought I got shocked!
[01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:59.380]  Anyways, check it out!
[01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:02.380]  She's rolling!
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:06.380]  Sorry, Cinda, I had to run.
[01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:12.380]  Oh, fuck it!
[01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:16.380]  I'll just turn it over real quick.
[01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:22.680]  Here's the washing machine!
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:27.080]  Put the timer on, it's been about a minute.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:31.080]  And you keep it at kind of the same pace, right?
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:35.080]  Same pace, brother!
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:38.080]  And it's not really beating it up so hard,
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:41.080]  where it's topping it up, you know what I mean?
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:44.080]  It's just moving it up a little bit faster,
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:47.080]  and it's getting it done for myself,
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:51.080]  instead of me beating it up with the oar, you know?
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:54.080]  So, I'm gonna put this back up here,
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:59.080]  I'm gonna assist it a little bit with the oar, just because...
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:05.080]  I can't believe these fuckers fell for it!
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.080]  What'd you say?
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:11.080]  How long are you doing it for?
[01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:13.080]  How many minutes?
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:16.080]  I'm gonna run this about 10 more minutes.
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:18.080]  10 more minutes, and then...
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:21.080]  Yeah, 10 more minutes, you get the camera, right?
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:24.080]  And it's been like 2 minutes so far?
[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:27.080]  I'm gonna run it 10 minutes, and then I'm gonna look through it with my...
[01:33:27.080 --> 01:34:00.660]  That's correct.
[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:04.660]  Quite honest with you, Peter, I like better washing outside in,
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:08.660]  when it's freaking 30-something degrees, 40 degrees outside,
[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:11.660]  than in this close quarters, man, I'm kinda claustrophobic,
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:15.660]  I'm big in nature, and I'm just not that bored of walking around here, man.
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:19.660]  I mean, poor Zunda, he's gotta walk around the whole time like this!
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:24.930]  Ha ha ha, shit!
[01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:31.930]  You're only happy running naked through the cannabis fields.
[01:34:31.930 --> 01:34:34.930]  Yeah, buddy!
[01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:37.930]  So, surfing, Peter, do you surf?
[01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:46.360]  A little bit, not much, I grew up on the water in Rhode Island.
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:50.360]  I grew up south of Port of the Yard, a little town called Milwaukee,
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:54.360]  in the state of Jalisco, right on the beach, my parents moved out there in 83,
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:58.360]  bought a little restaurant right on the beach, and I grew up literally right on the beach surfing,
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:03.360]  and I love surf, I love tanja,
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:08.360]  it was the thing to do, you know, I was the one Peter that didn't like to go to rodeos and play soccer, bro,
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:11.360]  I listened to reggae, instead of that,
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:21.360]  I just never was to my thing, man, you know, so, it was just, plus, girls like surfers in my town.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:31.880]  Ha ha! Sorry, baby!
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:34.880]  So the stand is pretty good, man,
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:40.880]  I kind of, my guy did this on Saturday, I put it together so I could bring it inside,
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:46.880]  normally I have a set up where I do this outside, I have a couple of 4x4s that I kind of do my little jimmy rig,
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:52.880]  and I put the set up outside, but I had to get all this new hardware so we could bring this inside,
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.880]  to do the wash inside.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:01.880]  Wait, but you're saying, so normally, like, in years past, you would do this outside?
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:08.880]  Yes, I like to do my washes outside, I know a lot of people are like,
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:12.880]  yeah, this fucking guy is a dumbass, yeah, I just don't have a walk-in cooler,
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:17.880]  I wish I had a walk-in cooler environment, I wish I had that environment, but I don't,
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:21.880]  so I work with what I have, I don't know if anybody knows,
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:24.880]  but we've been getting hail fucking storms here in Garden Grove,
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:29.880]  past winter, a couple of winters ago, we've been getting hail storming, guess what?
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:35.880]  I'm out here washing, well, you know, everybody's out there playing in the little, I'm out there washing,
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:42.880]  so I get my fishing gear, I have, geez, I forgot what the brand is,
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:47.880]  but anyways, I got fishing gear that I use when I go fishing tuna,
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.880]  and I put boots in, and I wash in the rain.
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:59.810]  So, somewhere right there, guys, is a magnifying glass and a little flat case,
[01:36:59.810 --> 01:37:01.810]  oh, no, it's right here, never mind.
[01:37:01.810 --> 01:37:15.300]  So, check it out, Peter, and viewers, I like to use this little Rower's Edge magnifying glass 30 times,
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:24.170]  I like to look at the stuff that I'm washing to see if it needs a little bit more beat down or not,
[01:37:24.170 --> 01:37:32.170]  Like I said, I only grow once per season, I don't grow indoor, I don't grow night div, I don't grow anything like that,
[01:37:32.170 --> 01:37:41.170]  I have one chance to grow all the medicine that I need for me, my wife, and some close friends that we share medicine.
[01:37:41.170 --> 01:37:45.170]  So, I really like to maximize and get everything I can.
[01:37:45.170 --> 01:37:50.170]  If that means that I'm going to get a little bit of flat matter by beating the shit out of this,
[01:37:51.170 --> 01:37:54.170]  I'm going to, instead of boxing it, obviously.
[01:37:54.170 --> 01:38:00.170]  But, I'm going to try to get some milk, I'm going to try to, and I think we did.
[01:38:00.170 --> 01:38:13.170]  My wife is telling me I've got five minutes, so I better hurry up.
[01:38:14.170 --> 01:38:30.980]  Check it out, Peter, just like if you're looking at trichromes on the tree structure,
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:47.760]  you're going to look in here, and for the look of it, there's still some heads on there.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:39:06.150]  There's still a lot of stalks as well, I see a lot of stalks.
[01:39:06.150 --> 01:39:09.150]  So, does that mean that you go harder or longer?
[01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:16.300]  I'm going to wait a little longer, bro.
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:19.300]  I'm going to try to maximize my yield on the second wash.
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:22.300]  Normally, the second wash is the one that dumps the most.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:27.300]  The first wash is just very, like, a little cha-cha-cha real quick, you know.
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:32.300]  But, the second wash is more of a rough one for me, at least that's what I like to do.
[01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:35.300]  Did you just sneak in a little on-camera dancing?
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:37.300]  Yes, sir.
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:39.300]  Can we get some more?
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:47.300]  Actually, when you and your wife first danced, was she impressed with your dancing skills?
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:53.300]  Brother, when I was dancing, I was dancing like a little girl.
[01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:55.300]  I was dancing like a little girl.
[01:39:55.300 --> 01:39:59.300]  When you and your wife first danced, was she impressed with your dancing skills?
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:07.300]  Brother, it's funny.
[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:12.300]  When me and my wife met, she was like, holy shit, there's this fucking beater that knows how to dance.
[01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:17.300]  Excuse my language, but I make fun of my own race, man.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:19.300]  I hope you don't get offended, anybody out there.
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:21.300]  But, I dance, and she loves it.
[01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:25.300]  I serve. Can you imagine, there's a Mexican dude that serves?
[01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:27.300]  Holy shit, like, I've heard of him.
[01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:29.300]  Like, seriously?
[01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:33.300]  It was just like a gimme-gimme egg, man.
[01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:40.300]  We used to get along a lot, and our kids were a blessing.
[01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:45.300]  It's been a beautiful, beautiful ride.
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:47.300]  Good to know.
[01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:50.300]  So, this thing is going, man.
[01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:55.300]  You know what, Peter? I was listening to that one episode you had, the guy that was playing the blues, bro.
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:57.300]  Do you play guitar?
[01:40:57.300 --> 01:40:59.300]  Oh, yeah, no. Get out.
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:03.300]  Do you have your guitar?
[01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:05.300]  You could play us a song while we're waiting.
[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:09.300]  Dude, I'm not ready for the stage right now, bro.
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:12.300]  I'm really not, but are you going to force me?
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:16.300]  No, let's save that for another episode, man.
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:20.300]  I'm not really set up right now.
[01:41:20.300 --> 01:41:22.300]  I do have two bands. I hooked up that thing.
[01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:26.300]  I don't know if anybody sent me pictures, but it's basically a five-string guitar.
[01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:28.300]  It's tuned to open G.
[01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:30.300]  I think there's a post on my page.
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:33.300]  I love the blues band. I love to play 12-bar blues.
[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:41.300]  Anything Johnson, anything Sunhouse, anything Willie Dixon, anything that's got a lot of power.
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:43.300]  Willie Dixon, anything old.
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:45.300]  Lead Belly.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:49.300]  Yeah, little Robert Johnson.
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:53.300]  Some Love and Vain.
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:55.300]  Robert Johnson, bro.
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:59.300]  Oh, yeah, Love and Vain, bro.
[01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:03.300]  Yeah, everyone now wants you to play.
[01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:09.150]  Go get the guitar. Go get the slide.
[01:42:10.150 --> 01:42:12.150]  We have to do the costumes first.
[01:42:12.150 --> 01:42:14.150]  We have to take it off.
[01:42:14.150 --> 01:42:16.150]  You ain't going to fuck with my ass.
[01:42:23.150 --> 01:42:26.150]  Anyway, the story behind that guitar.
[01:42:26.150 --> 01:42:33.150]  We were driving down to another park, and we saw this guy lift his guitar at the top of the park, and he drove away.
[01:42:34.150 --> 01:42:48.150]  He dropped the guitar in the middle of the street, and I picked up the guitar, and all that was left, it was five tuning pegs.
[01:42:48.150 --> 01:42:53.150]  So I looked up, what can I do with five tuning pegs?
[01:42:54.150 --> 01:43:03.150]  Keith Richards has a guitar that has only five strings, and it's tuned to open G, and he plays blues with it.
[01:43:03.150 --> 01:43:07.150]  He just took the low E string out, and he fucking rocked it.
[01:43:07.150 --> 01:43:12.150]  As a matter of fact, was it Stripes?
[01:43:12.150 --> 01:43:15.150]  What's his name? I'm having a brain fart.
[01:43:15.150 --> 01:43:17.150]  Oh, shit.
[01:43:17.150 --> 01:43:20.150]  The White Stripes?
[01:43:21.150 --> 01:43:24.150]  White Stripes. He inspired me, bro.
[01:43:24.150 --> 01:43:28.150]  When I saw that video, when he fucking hooked up that pickup to that fucking stick.
[01:43:28.150 --> 01:43:33.150]  Guess what, man? I put a pickup on this thing, and we electrified this fucking stick, and it came out.
[01:43:33.150 --> 01:43:41.150]  And you know what's surprising me? I leave that fucking guitar for a whole year, it sits, and it holds tune for a whole year.
[01:43:41.150 --> 01:43:48.550]  Anyways, these heads are mostly out.
[01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:51.550]  Check it out, bro.
[01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:03.550]  See them? See the socks?
[01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:07.550]  So it looks like most of the heads have fallen off the socks.
[01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:11.550]  I'm going to give it two more minutes just for shits and giggles, and this is coming out.
[01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:21.000]  And we got to rethread all of our bags, so maybe you want to bring the bags, start with the white one, please?
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:32.440]  Keep shit.
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:43.280]  The shit we got to do for exposure, right?
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:50.280]  So, as you can notice, water is not really that saturated with so much ice.
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:57.280]  Letting the water flow in there freely, but there's plenty of ice, enough to keep the water cold enough in temperature.
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:04.280]  But it's not completely saturated, so it's giving all those, you know, room in there for the stuff to come off.
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:07.280]  So, here we go.
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:10.280]  1073, yes.
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:13.280]  We only got one, thank you.
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:16.280]  I guess, black.
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:21.120]  Thank you.
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:26.120]  So right now we're threading the bags back into place, Peter, and we're getting ready to dump the second wash.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:30.120]  Hopefully we don't take up so much time. I know a lot of people need to work tomorrow.
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:35.120]  I got to work tomorrow, so, man, I hope we can get it done.
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:39.120]  Now we go with the 120.
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:42.120]  We're all cheering you on.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:45.120]  Vote for Pedro.
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:54.120]  Dude, when that movie came out, bro, during my birthday, like, I got like six presents that were all the same fucking shit that said, vote for Pedro.
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:57.120]  It was fucking hilarious.
[01:45:57.120 --> 01:46:00.120]  He's talking about Napoleon Dynamite.
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:07.530]  Yeah.
[01:46:10.930 --> 01:46:23.930]  Luckily, my assistant knows some hash-making skills here, and he can put his threads on me talking over here, and I don't have to really focus so much on what he's doing, because he knows what he's doing.
[01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:37.930]  Although he is, he's learning from me whatever he can learn from me, but he knows a lot more of hash, kind of, sort of, taste-wise, and all the other stuff more than that.
[01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:45.100]  He has more experience than I do. I'm just here in my cave, so.
[01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:53.100]  So, the thing we're going to do different here, guys, we're going to be using the big bag.
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:57.100]  All right? I'm going to turn this off without getting chocked this time.
[01:46:57.100 --> 01:47:00.100]  Oh, shit.
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:03.100]  Sorry, Sunda.
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:06.100]  All right.
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:09.100]  See this, guys?
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:12.100]  This is a fruit-match bag.
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:35.610]  We're going to pour this.
[01:47:35.610 --> 01:47:40.610]  So, these bags were made to fit around a 55-gallon drum.
[01:47:40.610 --> 01:47:47.610]  Or at least, this particular bag still looks like it's going to fit, but it should.
[01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:51.610]  This is a brand-new bag.
[01:47:51.610 --> 01:47:54.610]  There.
[01:47:55.610 --> 01:47:58.610]  All right.
[01:47:58.610 --> 01:48:00.610]  You guys see that, Peter?
[01:48:00.610 --> 01:48:02.610]  Yeah.
[01:48:02.610 --> 01:48:04.610]  Yeah.
[01:48:04.610 --> 01:48:06.610]  I think we might have.
[01:48:06.610 --> 01:48:07.610]  All right.
[01:48:07.610 --> 01:48:09.610]  Here we go.
[01:48:09.610 --> 01:48:13.610]  So, I'm going to take this plant matter out.
[01:48:13.610 --> 01:48:16.610]  I'm going to run it right through that bag.
[01:48:17.610 --> 01:48:23.890]  All right.
[01:48:23.890 --> 01:48:26.890]  So, I'm going to throw this entire pile out there.
[01:48:26.890 --> 01:48:29.890]  And we'll have some winter plants.
[01:48:29.890 --> 01:48:34.890]  And I will give these to my friends, those friends that are growing.
[01:48:34.890 --> 01:48:37.890]  And they'll do some light dip and stuff like that.
[01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:41.890]  I don't do it myself, but they grow some stuff, so let's do it.
[01:48:41.890 --> 01:48:45.890]  Here we go.
[01:48:46.890 --> 01:48:51.890]  So, I'm just going to add more of everything over in.
[01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:58.320]  Into this drum.
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:15.260]  BC Bubble Man, if you're listening, bro, help me up with a set of bags, bro.
[01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:20.980]  Seriously, I'm always rocking your gear, man.
[01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:29.320]  Dude, if anybody asks me what kind of bags do I use, I always tell them bubble bags.
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:31.320]  Why?
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:36.320]  Because I've only bought this one set or these two sets, this 20-gallon and 5-gallon.
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.320]  And I haven't had the need to buy another set.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:41.320]  So, I'm not knocking on anybody else's stuff.
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:46.320]  I just haven't used anybody else's stuff because I haven't had the need to.
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:49.320]  So, what up, Marcus?
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.320]  What up, Marcus?
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:55.320]  Hook it up, bro.
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:50:02.320]  Marcus is an hour and 50 minutes deep in the replay of this conversation.
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:05.320]  But yeah, I'll reach out to him.
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:08.320]  I'll see if he'll send you some.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:12.320]  Baby needs new shoes.
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:15.320]  Asking you shall receive.
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:18.320]  Seeking you shall find.
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:19.320]  Oh, shit.
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:21.320]  I'm getting up in the fucking philosophical here.
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:46.840]  Did we lose you?
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:50:59.200]  Pedro.
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:03.200]  You're back.
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:05.200]  Yo.
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:06.200]  You're back.
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:07.200]  Talk to me.
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:08.200]  Yep.
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:09.200]  I lost you there.
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:11.200]  You're back.
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.200]  I'm back.
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:13.200]  I'm back.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:17.110]  We've been having connection problems.
[01:51:17.110 --> 01:51:18.110]  Sorry, Peter.
[01:51:18.110 --> 01:51:20.110]  No worries.
[01:51:20.110 --> 01:51:23.110]  Well, for the first, like, half an hour, I thought it was on my end.
[01:51:23.110 --> 01:51:24.110]  So, I was like.
[01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:28.110]  All right.
[01:51:28.110 --> 01:51:29.110]  Check it out, man.
[01:51:29.110 --> 01:51:34.110]  So, this is where I like to gently move my material.
[01:51:34.110 --> 01:51:37.110]  Right in this bag.
[01:51:37.110 --> 01:51:39.110]  Just gently.
[01:51:40.110 --> 01:51:44.110]  You can see by the color of the water that this particular wash is going to be
[01:51:44.110 --> 01:51:47.110]  dumping for sure.
[01:51:47.110 --> 01:52:00.280]  See that?
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:04.280]  I'm going to gently just continue to roll this material back and forth.
[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.280]  Just gently.
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:07.280]  Not so crazy.
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:11.280]  Because, I mean, this is bigger mesh than a 220.
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:15.280]  So, some plant matter is still going to go through, which I'm going to be able
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:20.280]  to, just like, fill up.
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:24.280]  And then that will be enough to fill up on the 220 coming up here in the next
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:26.280]  set of builders.
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:28.280]  So, maybe you want to do me a favor?
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:29.280]  Sorry.
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:31.280]  We need that.
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:33.280]  Actually, no.
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:34.280]  We need that other barrel.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:36.280]  One more barrel.
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.280]  Sorry, guys.
[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:44.800]  We're going to go get one more barrel outside.
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:45.800]  Peter!
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:49.240]  There he goes.
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:52.560]  I may go get another beer while we're waiting.
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:58.960]  Peter, dude, I haven't smoked a dooper in a couple of days, except we started this live.
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:04.160]  Trust me, I'm Jones and I smoke some of the sash.
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:07.480]  I just opened a packet earlier today.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:12.480]  I'm barely moaning that we were smoking last time and, oh man, it's pretty good.
[01:53:28.410 --> 01:53:33.410]  Basically, we want to get the last bit of water out of this drum.
[01:53:35.410 --> 01:53:38.410]  We want to get the last few good ass drops.
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:52.320]  This is what we gotta do.
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:55.320]  Alright, I'm back.
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:57.320]  What did I miss?
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:53:59.320]  Alright.
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:04.320]  It looks like the bag kinda slipped off, but we're good.
[01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:08.240]  Alright.
[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:10.240]  Let's all just...
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:11.240]  Here we go, guys.
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:13.240]  So I'm gonna get one more little...
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:15.240]  Yeah.
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:16.240]  This might matter if we go out.
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:21.080]  I'm gonna step up.
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:22.080]  Guys, I'll be back.
[01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:23.080]  I promise.
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:24.080]  I'm gonna take this material outside.
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:26.080]  I'm gonna throw it in my planter.
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:30.080]  I'm gonna take this particular area where this mat was grown.
[01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:32.080]  I have the areas numbered.
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:35.080]  I know exactly where this plant came from.
[01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:38.080]  I'm gonna put this material back into the same area.
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:42.080]  The reason why is because if some of these seeds germinate, which they will pretty soon,
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.080]  I want to know exactly what plant it is.
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:48.080]  That way I can give it to some of the friends and local people that I know here around the area
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:49.080]  and do something with them.
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:50.080]  So here we go.
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:51.080]  I'll be back.
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:04.440]  Alright.
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:06.440]  It's just you and me.
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:08.440]  It's good.
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:19.440]  So I like the attention to detail that you put each plant back in the bed that it came from.
[01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:26.950]  To me, it's closing the loop, Peter.
[01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:30.950]  In some kind of crazy way, it means a lot to me.
[01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:31.950]  It means a lot to me.
[01:55:31.950 --> 01:55:32.950]  I respect the plant a lot.
[01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:37.950]  My wife calls me sometimes crazy when I'm about to chop a plant down.
[01:55:37.950 --> 01:55:39.950]  And I just have a little conversation with the plant.
[01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:41.950]  Talk to the plant.
[01:55:41.950 --> 01:55:45.950]  Thank the plant for producing what it does.
[01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:47.950]  Being who it is.
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:53.600]  If it's listening, cool.
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:54.600]  If not, it's cool.
[01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:56.600]  It makes me feel better.
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:59.600]  As long as I can make you feel better, that's all that matters.
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:01.600]  So here we go, guys.
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:03.600]  I agree.
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:05.600]  Alright.
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:08.600]  Alright.
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:09.600]  Alright.
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:14.600]  So this one, I'm going to give it a quick little rinse.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:16.600]  My wife is going to run again.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:17.600]  Sorry, baby.
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:19.600]  She's going to run to rinse this bucket.
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:25.600]  And then we're going to pour the rest of this water through these filters again.
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:28.600]  Now we won't have any material.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:32.600]  There might be some material in there, but not much at all.
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:34.600]  There will be little plant matter.
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:39.600]  They will go through the first fruit fly mesh bag that I make.
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:53.600]  But yeah, the reason why that came is because it makes it a lot easier to beat the shit out of that material without harming the filters on these expensive bags.
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:58.600]  I really don't like to beat them up.
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:02.600]  So I beat up the other bag that I make because they're just more disposable.
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:05.600]  I have a shitload of material, and I can just make them on tap.
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:06.600]  So thank you, sweetheart.
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:08.600]  Alright, here we go, guys.
[01:57:47.470 --> 01:57:48.470]  Alright.
[01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:50.470]  Here we go.
[01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:57.470]  So we just filled up this 35-gallon jug, and we're pouring the water out through this bigot.
[01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:59.470]  You don't have to have a spigot.
[01:57:59.470 --> 01:58:09.470]  Like I said previously, when I washed outside, I just had a 55-gallon drum with a 3-eighths hole drilled right at the bottom.
[01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:11.470]  And I just let it flow.
[01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:18.470]  But just to make it nice and more controllable inside of this room, today I went to Home Depot and bought that bulkhead flange.
[01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:22.470]  It's called a bulkhead flange if anybody wants to build something like this.
[01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:25.470]  They're about $10 or something like that.
[01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:32.470]  And just install it, glue your hardware, and you should be good to go.
[01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:38.470]  It definitely makes it a lot controllable, a lot easier to control the water flow coming out of here.
[01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:51.520]  So the goal here, truly, Peter, the reason why I wanted to do this is if—
[01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:58.520]  I mean, when I was young and I would go down the street now and see those dare signs in school and stuff like that,
[01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:04.520]  don't do drugs and stuff like that, to me it was like dare to put a seed in the ground.
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:06.520]  Seriously, that's what I would think.
[01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:10.520]  And I was planting shit everywhere I could, to be honest with you.
[01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:19.520]  So if I can dare anybody to go out there and plant some fucking seeds and grow some herbs and produce your own medication,
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:21.520]  then more power.
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:29.520]  If this two hours time that we spend here talking to this freaking screen and you guys listening,
[01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:33.520]  lucky enough you guys are listening, then it's worth my time.
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:35.520]  Seriously.
[01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:40.520]  I feel like I'm listening to you take a really long piss.
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:52.520]  Like my point of view is like you from the side, just kind of facing a direction like you're standing against a urinal.
[01:59:52.520 --> 02:00:00.520]  Oh my God.
[02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:04.520]  So let me tell you a story, Peter.
[02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:08.520]  A while back, you know, we used to do some growing up in the San Bernardino Mountains.
[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:14.520]  And we would do guerrilla style grows, you know.
[02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:27.520]  And I bought a Boy Scout outfit at a Chinese yard sale for like $4, maybe $3.75.
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:37.520]  And I would fit my fat ass in an Eagle Scout Boy Scout suit and I would go out hiking up in the mountains to irrigate my plants and stuff like that.
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:43.520]  And I would carry a reading the rain notepad that I would write poetry.
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:47.520]  And just in case, you know, and...
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:50.520]  All right. Just to be clear, this wasn't recently.
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:55.520]  This was like when you were of an age where it would be normal for you to be wearing a Boy Scout outfit.
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:59.520]  Because like if you were wearing a Boy Scout outfit now, it'd be very weird.
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:03.520]  I was a big fat tall dude wearing a big fucking...
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:13.520]  Anyways, I was maybe in my 30s, something like that.
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:15.520]  Seriously.
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:19.520]  One time I ran across the Rangers, bro.
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:22.520]  And the Rangers tells me, what are you doing up here?
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:25.520]  And I'm like, oh, I'm out here inspired.
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:28.520]  I'm getting inspiration so I can write some poetry.
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:31.520]  Do you mind if I can read you some?
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:34.520]  And he looked at me, he's like, oh, no, no, no, no, please don't.
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:37.520]  And fucking got his shit and left.
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:40.520]  And that was one of the stories that I always like to tell.
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:43.520]  Boy Scout outfit story.
[02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:50.520]  It got me out of getting busted one time while we were growing some stuff out in the middle of nowhere.
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:56.520]  I was still growing and being greedy, trying to grow a little bit more somewhere in wilderness areas.
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:59.520]  I mean, that worked out for me.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:00.520]  I won't do it again.
[02:02:00.520 --> 02:02:02.520]  I'm just plain stupid.
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:10.520]  But the things that you would do when you're out there, you know, when your imagination is wide open, fungi is involved.
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:13.520]  So, yeah.
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:16.520]  Yeah.
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.520]  So we're just waiting for the stuff to fucking come.
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:26.520]  And are you guys going to harvest your mushroom blocks next?
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:30.520]  What do you mean?
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:34.520]  I'm implying growing mushrooms.
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:36.520]  Yeah.
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:39.520]  I got a little work tomorrow, man.
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:47.810]  It's been a rough one.
[02:02:47.810 --> 02:02:55.400]  By putting the Boy Scout outfit on, you're trying to draw attention.
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:57.400]  Right, right, right.
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:00.400]  Well, I was trying to be that one weirdo that nobody wanted to talk to me.
[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:01.400]  You know what I mean?
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:02.400]  Did it work for work?
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:03.400]  Perfect for me.
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:05.400]  You know what?
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:10.400]  We're a goddamn Eagle Scout suit and what around the wilderness fucking writing poetry, bro.
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:11.400]  It worked for me.
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:16.400]  You know, it's a crazy approach, man, but it works.
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:18.400]  Hey, I got me some good ass fucking man.
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:20.400]  And who's the cover from the whole thing?
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:27.120]  So, hey, backpack it.
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:32.120]  It's coming.
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:34.120]  I think you're the biggest weirdo.
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:35.120]  Right?
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:41.120]  Fucking guy's a weirdo.
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:44.120]  Bro, life is too short to not have fun.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:46.120]  Keep saying it.
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:51.120]  All right, so I'm taking this 220 out, Peter.
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:04:06.220]  Whatever plant matter went through that big bag that we were using should be trapped right here.
[02:04:06.220 --> 02:04:08.220]  You see it?
[02:04:08.220 --> 02:04:11.220]  I'm going to honestly give this up to the freaking spirits.
[02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:16.220]  I'm not doing nothing with it.
[02:04:16.220 --> 02:04:19.220]  Oh, someone is getting the light.
[02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:25.220]  So that's the 220 came out after that big bag.
[02:04:25.220 --> 02:04:28.220]  We're going to dump it in the trash.
[02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:59.720]  So this is second run 220, but you kept the first run 220.
[02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:07.720]  Fred said it looks like.
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:12.720]  Just trying to get this flow to come in a little faster.
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:21.110]  All right, here we go.
[02:05:21.110 --> 02:05:23.110]  I'm going to add some more buckets of water into this.
[02:05:23.110 --> 02:05:36.460]  It really doesn't take a lot to make hash in your backyard, man.
[02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:43.460]  All it takes is a little bit of dedication, a little bit of craziness, and the wanting to do it.
[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:51.680]  Yeah, but it's a once a year thing, right?
[02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:56.680]  For you, you do it for like a week a year.
[02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:59.680]  It helps me out in some certain way.
[02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:01.680]  I'm not the kind of guy that.
[02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:03.680]  Say that again.
[02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:13.680]  I get somehow build something to make something to get it done somehow my way, that that's the route that I'm going to take.
[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:18.680]  Like you keep saying, it works for me, man.
[02:06:25.170 --> 02:06:34.170]  So based on the looks of that material that I was washing or that we just pulled out, it's done.
[02:06:34.170 --> 02:06:35.170]  Do a wash.
[02:06:35.170 --> 02:06:38.170]  Two was good enough.
[02:06:38.170 --> 02:06:43.850]  We'll see what we get out of these bags.
[02:06:43.850 --> 02:06:44.850]  Thanks.
[02:06:44.850 --> 02:07:07.040]  Appreciate it, bro.
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:10.040]  Peter's probably asleep over there.
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:20.040]  I'm answering people on the chat right now because someone has to go into work.
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:22.040]  Boring you.
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:23.040]  Well, guess what?
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:26.040]  Right after this, I got a couple of boobers.
[02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:29.040]  We're going to smoke some hash.
[02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:33.960]  It's going to be a good sesh.
[02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:45.200]  I need to go to sleep anyways.
[02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:59.200]  So we went ahead and lit up the sun pump on the side and we're pushing out all the water that we've been running and rising out of the room.
[02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:00.200]  It's right over there.
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:03.200]  Right next to that ghetto air conditioner.
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:30.870]  So what have you also only poured this water into that same cultivar's bed?
[02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:33.870]  It's taking a lot more time to drip out.
[02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:42.870]  So the reason why this is taking longer for the water to drip out is because there's a lot more trichromes getting trapped through these screens.
[02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:49.870]  So it might take a little longer than the first, obviously, because there's a lot more heads in the second launch.
[02:08:49.870 --> 02:08:51.870]  So we just got to have to be patient.
[02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:52.870]  We cannot rush it.
[02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:55.870]  I hope you can stick around.
[02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:58.870]  If not, this episode is going to be recorded.
[02:08:58.870 --> 02:09:03.780]  You can check it out if you decide to.
[02:09:03.780 --> 02:09:05.780]  Some people may watch it twice.
[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:13.780]  So I'm going to go ahead and give these a shake.
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:15.780]  I don't like to shake them so much.
[02:09:15.780 --> 02:09:20.780]  I'm going to give them a shake to encourage the water to go down quicker.
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:39.760]  I'm trying to grab all the screens at the same time and shaking them all.
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:48.760]  The screens are getting clogged up from the amount of trichromes.
[02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:51.760]  It's going to be a lot more than the first one.
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:59.480]  That's why it's taking so long.
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:01.480]  Are you there, Peter?
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:09.800]  I'm still here.
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:18.800]  So the genetics on this, it's monkey berries from exotic genetic mite.
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:22.800]  I'm having a brain fart, to be honest with you.
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:38.520]  I'm having a brain fart.
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:41.520]  I'm having a brain fart.
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:46.520]  I'm having a brain fart.
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:49.520]  It's been a long day.
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:50.520]  This is monkey berries.
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:54.520]  Got it.
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:59.520]  Someone asked, what?
[02:11:53.460 --> 02:12:05.170]  I'm going to give you a break.
[02:12:05.170 --> 02:12:47.310]  I'm going to give you a break.
[02:12:47.310 --> 02:12:52.310]  That's a good sign, man.
[02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:55.310]  We got some cash flooding these filters.
[02:12:55.310 --> 02:13:02.310]  Is this a high-anticipation moment for you?
[02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:04.310]  It could be a great yield.
[02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:08.310]  I can't hear me.
[02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:10.310]  I can't hear me.
[02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:15.310]  It's cold but you can tell it's going like this.
[02:13:15.310 --> 02:13:18.310]  I'm seeing it skim over the top of the ice.
[02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:29.680]  It's cool though, it doesn't work so good.
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:38.960]  So, I want to see how much the pilots are going to start to learn in this run.
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:40.960]  Yeah, no, I don't think he hears.
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:43.960]  I definitely know he doesn't hear me anymore.
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:47.960]  I'm not sure if I can hear you.
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:50.960]  I have no idea if anyone can hear me.
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:55.960]  What I'm doing with you guys is I'm working with fresh frozen material when you beat it up.
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:13:59.960]  When you're working with dry material, it's a lot more brittle.
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:04.960]  And a lot more material gets broken up into pieces and ends up in your hatch.
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:10.960]  So, I always, I mean, that's why I like to do fresh frozen material.
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:16.960]  And I like to freeze it as soon as possible so that material is still green.
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:24.960]  And it has some flexibility so when you beat it up, it's not really beating up the plant matter into your hatch.
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:59.060]  Thank you, Soonja, I appreciate it.
[02:14:59.060 --> 02:15:07.060]  Go ahead and give him a follow at SmokeCashNotDope.
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:11.060]  He's posting all kinds of good stuff.
[02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:15.060]  Wait, so you can see the chat?
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:20.720]  Oh, you can't hear me.
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:27.720]  I'm wondering if he's watching the video, which is affecting his internet connection.
[02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:33.720]  And I don't know if anyone can even hear me.
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:37.720]  I've got slow motors but no one can tell.
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:40.720]  No, I just wasn't moving.
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:42.720]  Oh, yeah.
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:48.720]  I wish I could just add a Uber in here, man.
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:51.720]  But, I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible.
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:53.720]  Yeah, it does work.
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:16:07.760]  It's just that I'm not set up, you know what I mean?
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:11.760]  Not set up for this particular inside.
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:13.760]  But, we're making it work.
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:16.760]  Trust me, there's going to be some good shit coming out of this for sure.
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:18.760]  Ooh, can't wait.
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:31.980]  We're going to be posting some milk shots as soon as this comes out of the freeze dryer.
[02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:33.980]  So, stay tuned.
[02:16:33.980 --> 02:16:35.980]  Yeah, can't wait, man.
[02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:37.980]  I can't wait.
[02:16:37.980 --> 02:16:48.460]  So, can you hear me at all?
[02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:49.460]  Peter, you're back.
[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:51.460]  Can you hear me?
[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:53.460]  Did we lose sound again?
[02:16:53.460 --> 02:16:55.460]  Yes.
[02:16:55.460 --> 02:16:57.460]  Yeah, we lost sound again, apparently.
[02:16:57.460 --> 02:16:59.460]  Oh, shit.
[02:16:59.460 --> 02:17:01.460]  I guess we did.
[02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:03.460]  I don't know if you guys can figure it out.
[02:17:03.460 --> 02:17:07.460]  I'm not going to compromise this hash log.
[02:17:07.460 --> 02:17:09.460]  I'm going to turn you on.
[02:17:09.460 --> 02:17:10.460]  Yes, you're back.
[02:17:10.460 --> 02:17:13.460]  Can you hear me now?
[02:17:13.460 --> 02:17:15.460]  Can you hear me now?
[02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:17.460]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[02:17:17.460 --> 02:17:21.460]  So, am I on your Bluetooth or is this just the cell phone?
[02:17:21.460 --> 02:17:23.460]  I'm on the cell phone now.
[02:17:23.460 --> 02:17:25.460]  Oh, yeah, this is perfect.
[02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:28.460]  I like this much better than the Bluetooth.
[02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:31.460]  All right, cool, cool.
[02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:32.460]  All right.
[02:17:32.460 --> 02:17:34.460]  Yeah, man.
[02:17:34.460 --> 02:17:40.460]  This particular second run has really taken a long time because there's a bunch of fucking hash in there clogging up the filter.
[02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:42.460]  So, we're just running it, man.
[02:17:42.460 --> 02:17:49.460]  Yeah, I felt like I was on Mars with, like, no ability to communicate with Earth.
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:57.830]  And I could see you.
[02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:59.830]  This is amazing to be able to talk again.
[02:17:59.830 --> 02:18:01.830]  Okay.
[02:18:01.830 --> 02:18:05.830]  Yeah, that would also be amazing.
[02:18:10.830 --> 02:18:12.830]  She can hear me.
[02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:15.830]  You tell him what I say.
[02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:17.830]  You can translate.
[02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:19.830]  Or you can relay the message.
[02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:23.830]  Yeah, brother.
[02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:25.830]  So, someone.
[02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:36.830]  So, someone asked a long time ago, like, how you wash the bags after your run.
[02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:43.000]  Although I guess we'll get there shortly.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  Yeah.
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.000]  Yes.
[02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.000]  We'll get there.
[02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.910]  He's right.
[02:18:50.910 --> 02:18:51.910]  Oh, sorry.
[02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:54.910]  Someone asked a while ago the room temperature.
[02:18:54.910 --> 02:18:56.910]  It's very persistent.
[02:18:57.910 --> 02:19:00.910]  The room temperature right now is 59 degrees.
[02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:01.910]  Got it.
[02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:02.910]  Are your nipples hard?
[02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:05.910]  With no coats or anything like that.
[02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:08.910]  But, yeah, it's 59 degrees.
[02:19:08.910 --> 02:19:10.910]  The wall temperature over there is saying 60 degrees.
[02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:15.910]  So, it's somewhere between 59 and 60 degrees.
[02:19:15.910 --> 02:19:18.910]  On the rock hard nipple scale, where are you?
[02:19:18.910 --> 02:19:22.910]  All the waters and the 35 degrees, we just tagged it with a laser.
[02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:24.910]  So.
[02:19:24.910 --> 02:19:27.910]  What was the question, Peter?
[02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:31.910]  I said on the rock hard nipple scale, where are you?
[02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:34.910]  On the rock hard nipple scale, where are you?
[02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:36.910]  Oh, bro.
[02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:37.910]  He's not there yet.
[02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:39.910]  Okay.
[02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:40.910]  We got nipplage.
[02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:44.910]  Shit.
[02:19:44.910 --> 02:19:47.910]  It feels like Halloween now, bro.
[02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:53.520]  Yeah, just dump that rest of the water.
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:55.520]  Oh, yeah.
[02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:58.520]  Someone asked why you're not running a cool bot.
[02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:02.860]  It's running.
[02:20:02.860 --> 02:20:05.860]  Ah.
[02:20:05.860 --> 02:20:06.860]  It's running.
[02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:08.860]  She's right there.
[02:20:08.860 --> 02:20:10.860]  Cool bot is running.
[02:20:10.860 --> 02:20:11.860]  It's working pretty good.
[02:20:11.860 --> 02:20:18.030]  It hasn't frosted up yet.
[02:20:18.030 --> 02:20:21.030]  58 degrees.
[02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:22.030]  It's running.
[02:20:22.030 --> 02:20:25.030]  So, is that your target temperature?
[02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:26.030]  No, man.
[02:20:26.030 --> 02:20:30.030]  I was hoping to get 40, but obviously we couldn't get to that temperature at all.
[02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:31.030]  Okay.
[02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:34.030]  I mean, seriously, it's been a struggle.
[02:20:34.030 --> 02:20:43.290]  This is coming, man.
[02:20:43.290 --> 02:20:48.010]  It's coming slowly, but surely.
[02:20:48.010 --> 02:20:55.010]  I love only being able to see your upper body and not really knowing what you're doing.
[02:20:55.010 --> 02:21:00.010]  Someone tuning in for the first time could get the wrong impression.
[02:21:00.010 --> 02:21:03.010]  Have you ever seen Selena, the movie, bro?
[02:21:03.010 --> 02:21:06.010]  When the mom does the washing machine, bro?
[02:21:06.010 --> 02:21:10.010]  Yeah, brother.
[02:21:10.010 --> 02:21:40.740]  Oh, weird.
[02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:42.740]  The audio just got weird again.
[02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:44.740]  Just grab all the bags.
[02:21:44.740 --> 02:21:45.740]  Here, Peter.
[02:21:45.740 --> 02:21:48.740]  Let me put this up.
[02:21:48.740 --> 02:21:57.000]  Hopefully we don't drop this phone.
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:03.000]  So, we just basically just continuously mowing these bags.
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:15.000]  The downfall of using these big bags, not the all filter mesh bags, is that you really have to work the material to get the hash through the filters.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:21.000]  But, Marcus! Marcus!
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000]  Where's my bag, bro?
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:29.000]  You're going to be like, buy them, you fucking cheap bastard.
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:30.000]  Oh, shit.
[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:33.000]  That's what people in the chat were guessing.
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000]  That maybe he'd give us a discount.
[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000]  Yeah, we're good.
[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:40.000]  I can't hear you, though, for whatever reason.
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000]  I know.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.000]  I'm aware of that.
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:55.190]  Yeah, Brendan, that's the direction we're going in.
[02:22:55.190 --> 02:23:01.190]  This is our, like, pilot.
[02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:05.190]  I know there's probably 200 billion better ways to do this, but this is my way.
[02:23:05.190 --> 02:23:35.120]  And I'm just a hard-headed fucker, and I'm going to keep doing it this way until I find a better way.
[02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:44.900]  Step off.
[02:23:44.900 --> 02:23:46.900]  Marcus, pull the rest of that shit out of there.
[02:23:46.900 --> 02:24:10.490]  Can you lift it?
[02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:13.020]  There you go.
[02:24:13.020 --> 02:24:15.020]  Yeah.
[02:24:15.020 --> 02:24:17.020]  That's for the spirits, bro.
[02:24:17.020 --> 02:24:24.530]  For the spirits.
[02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:29.530]  So, yeah, man, we just poured the last of the water down the pipe, and we're just waiting.
[02:24:29.530 --> 02:24:31.530]  We just continue to wait, man.
[02:24:31.530 --> 02:24:35.530]  Shit, I can't believe it's been two hours and 24 minutes that we've been live.
[02:24:35.530 --> 02:24:37.530]  If anybody's still hanging around, man, thank you.
[02:24:37.530 --> 02:24:38.530]  I appreciate it.
[02:24:38.530 --> 02:24:42.530]  It can be boring sometimes, but this is what hash is.
[02:24:42.530 --> 02:24:56.050]  I mean, this is what it takes to make hash.
[02:24:56.050 --> 02:25:01.050]  The room is still at 59 degrees.
[02:25:01.050 --> 02:25:02.050]  I can't believe it's 59 degrees.
[02:25:02.050 --> 02:25:03.050]  Can you feel it now?
[02:25:03.050 --> 02:25:06.050]  No, I don't.
[02:25:06.050 --> 02:25:18.680]  Al is getting impatient.
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:21.680]  You can drill the hole through your ice block that you have.
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:23.680]  I'm sorry, someone had a question or something?
[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:26.680]  I'm sorry, I'm not paying attention to the screen, guys.
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:28.680]  I'm just trying to get these filters.
[02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:29.680]  It's okay, you do you.
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:31.680]  And I'm trying to get this hash made, man.
[02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:33.680]  You do you.
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:47.920]  That's why I think we should put it back over there.
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:51.920]  Every time we come over here, we'll do this to our signal.
[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:53.920]  Signal's actually pretty good right now.
[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:55.920]  I'm glad you said you can hear me.
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:25:59.920]  It's like this is the best it's been all night.
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:01.920]  The best it's been all night.
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:02.920]  What was that?
[02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:03.920]  The best it's been all night.
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:05.920]  All right, good.
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:47.320]  Your son must have stopped watching porn and gone to bed.
[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:49.320]  Did you see that?
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:56.850]  You can't hear me.
[02:26:56.850 --> 02:27:02.700]  You'll put the AC.
[02:27:02.700 --> 02:27:03.700]  You'll put two things on.
[02:27:03.700 --> 02:27:17.940]  Something's supposed to be on the bottom window.
[02:27:17.940 --> 02:27:19.940]  Somewhere, a fire marshal.
[02:27:20.940 --> 02:27:22.940]  That's correct.
[02:27:22.940 --> 02:27:36.390]  You want to plug that in?
[02:27:36.390 --> 02:27:40.390]  This could have been our guitar playing interlude.
[02:27:40.390 --> 02:27:41.390]  All right, you still can't hear me.
[02:27:41.390 --> 02:27:45.390]  Just running this.
[02:27:45.390 --> 02:27:48.390]  Just trying to empty all this water out.
[02:27:48.390 --> 02:27:54.710]  It's taken decades.
[02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:56.710]  I'm going to pour a little bit of hash.
[02:27:56.710 --> 02:28:34.780]  Love it.
[02:28:34.780 --> 02:28:38.780]  All right, we're taking out all the drums and everything out of here.
[02:28:38.780 --> 02:28:44.780]  I lined the entire floor with towels just because I don't want nobody to slip, trip, or fall.
[02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:49.820]  So, yeah.
[02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:58.330]  It's heavy.
[02:28:58.330 --> 02:29:03.330]  I'm standing on the tall side of the fucking Sanford High.
[02:29:03.330 --> 02:29:07.330]  Walking around on a sand creek the entire fucking evening.
[02:29:07.330 --> 02:29:10.330]  That's two hours of fucking sideways neck turning.
[02:29:10.330 --> 02:29:31.240]  Oh, shit.
[02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:36.280]  You going to unplug that thing?
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:37.280]  You're good, baby.
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:38.280]  You're good.
[02:29:38.280 --> 02:30:03.690]  You stay right there.
[02:30:03.690 --> 02:30:14.060]  You have one more bag of ice cream out there?
[02:30:14.060 --> 02:30:17.060]  I'm going to pour it back.
[02:30:17.060 --> 02:30:21.060]  You brought the ice in there.
[02:30:21.060 --> 02:30:23.060]  You want to make sure it's as cold as possible.
[02:30:23.060 --> 02:30:34.060]  All right, guys, so we're just making sure that all the water is as cold as possible before we go ahead and rinse these bags out.
[02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:39.060]  It's super important if your water is not cold, you better make it cold.
[02:30:39.060 --> 02:30:40.060]  So, it's 40 degrees.
[02:30:40.060 --> 02:30:49.840]  We're going to run it.
[02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:54.840]  I wish it was a little colder, but it is what it is.
[02:30:54.840 --> 02:31:30.900]  You got a bag?
[02:31:30.900 --> 02:31:49.550]  I'm just going to try to rinse out this 220 as much as possible.
[02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:53.550]  I'm even going to get deep down and dirty with a little bit of hand here.
[02:31:53.550 --> 02:31:54.550]  Move this stuff out.
[02:31:54.550 --> 02:32:00.550]  Try to get as much as strikes through that 220 as much as you can.
[02:32:00.550 --> 02:32:08.960]  Rinse all this material through.
[02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:12.960]  And this entire 220 bag is going for the spirits.
[02:32:12.960 --> 02:32:33.090]  Spirit run.
[02:32:33.090 --> 02:32:36.090]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[02:32:36.090 --> 02:32:39.090]  All right, here we go, guys.
[02:32:39.090 --> 02:32:45.090]  This is the 190.
[02:32:45.090 --> 02:32:47.090]  You smell that, bro?
[02:32:47.090 --> 02:32:48.090]  Yeah.
[02:32:48.090 --> 02:33:43.200]  Woo!
[02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:44.200]  Moving back and forth.
[02:33:44.200 --> 02:33:47.200]  Sorry, guys, trying to accommodate the shot here.
[02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:48.200]  Thanks, dude.
[02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:55.500]  Yeah.
[02:33:55.500 --> 02:34:00.500]  We'll start with the 190 again.
[02:34:01.500 --> 02:34:06.500]  Yeah.
[02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:31.760]  All right, 190 is out.
[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:44.280]  All right.
[02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:46.280]  We're just going to pick it up over here, bro.
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:49.640]  Spirit?
[02:34:49.640 --> 02:34:53.640]  Yeah.
[02:34:53.640 --> 02:34:56.640]  All right, guys.
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:00.800]  Give it a little spray.
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:07.440]  Basically, what we're trying to do here is wash all the sidewalls,
[02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:09.440]  make sure everything gets down to the screen mesh.
[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:11.440]  That's the goal.
[02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:15.440]  We're going to lift it up, and we're going to bring it on your collection tray
[02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:19.440]  or collection tub.
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:25.190]  This is the 160.
[02:35:25.190 --> 02:35:35.350]  Oh, yeah, baby.
[02:35:35.350 --> 02:35:50.150]  Looks like we got a little bit of plant matter in one of them.
[02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:51.150]  I can't hear you, Peter.
[02:35:51.150 --> 02:35:54.150]  I don't know if you're trying to say anything or if anybody's trying to
[02:35:54.150 --> 02:35:56.150]  comment.
[02:36:02.580 --> 02:36:03.580]  We can put it in the freeze dryer.
[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:10.260]  It's getting late.
[02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:24.130]  I'm on the same page.
[02:36:24.130 --> 02:36:28.660]  Let's see if he reads the message.
[02:36:28.660 --> 02:36:32.660]  It's my only current form of communication.
[02:36:32.660 --> 02:36:34.660]  I'm going to give it another rinse.
[02:36:34.660 --> 02:36:43.540]  Put a little oil.
[02:36:43.540 --> 02:36:50.050]  That is true.
[02:36:50.050 --> 02:36:52.050]  There you go.
[02:36:52.050 --> 02:36:54.050]  Again, I'm sorry, guys.
[02:36:54.050 --> 02:36:55.050]  I can't see any comments.
[02:36:55.050 --> 02:36:57.050]  I don't know if the camera is pointing down.
[02:36:57.050 --> 02:36:58.050]  I'm so sorry, guys.
[02:36:58.050 --> 02:37:00.050]  I don't know what you guys are saying.
[02:37:00.050 --> 02:37:01.050]  I'm just trying to concentrate.
[02:37:01.050 --> 02:37:06.050]  I'm getting this hash out of this bag.
[02:37:06.050 --> 02:37:14.570]  All right.
[02:37:14.570 --> 02:37:16.570]  So that's the 160.
[02:37:16.570 --> 02:37:20.120]  Freeze dryer?
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:23.120]  Yeah, freeze dryer.
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:28.120]  Sundar is going to go ahead and put it in the freeze dryer,
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:34.120]  and my wife is going to go ahead and rinse this bucket up,
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:43.000]  or this bag, I should say.
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:38:08.960]  All right, here comes the 120.
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:10.960]  Oh, sorry.
[02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:13.960]  This is where we need the hose fan.
[02:38:13.960 --> 02:38:21.730]  So we're rinsing the outside.
[02:38:21.730 --> 02:38:24.730]  Now this is the one that I'm going to be washing.
[02:38:24.730 --> 02:38:52.620]  Does my face look really good?
[02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:54.620]  Oh, fuck, yeah.
[02:38:54.620 --> 02:38:56.620]  This is the thing we get excited about.
[02:38:56.620 --> 02:38:59.620]  Look at how beautiful that blonde hash is looking.
[02:38:59.620 --> 02:39:03.620]  Oh, yeah, baby.
[02:39:03.620 --> 02:39:11.070]  All right, let's go on a different tray.
[02:39:11.070 --> 02:39:15.070]  We got two trays.
[02:39:15.070 --> 02:39:19.070]  Look at that, dude.
[02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:20.070]  Right on.
[02:39:20.070 --> 02:39:23.070]  It looks like that's going to be some nice melt right there, guys.
[02:39:23.070 --> 02:39:25.070]  Look at that, guys.
[02:39:25.070 --> 02:39:28.070]  Straight out of oil.
[02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:32.170]  Look at that.
[02:39:32.170 --> 02:39:33.170]  I know I am.
[02:39:33.170 --> 02:39:42.560]  Thank you.
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:56.400]  All right, Sundar.
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:40:01.440]  There you go.
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:10.770]  Holy poly going.
[02:40:10.770 --> 02:40:14.770]  Yeah, buddy.
[02:40:14.770 --> 02:40:17.770]  Ciento veinte.
[02:40:17.770 --> 02:40:25.990]  This is the 120.
[02:40:25.990 --> 02:40:30.990]  And, I mean, really, if you look at these bags, it's not really that cold in this room.
[02:40:30.990 --> 02:40:32.990]  It's kind of melting on the bag.
[02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:37.990]  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to bring the temperature down as much as I wanted to, but it's going to work.
[02:40:37.990 --> 02:40:41.990]  So I'm going to have to work at these bags tomorrow to clean them up really good.
[02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:45.990]  We're going to be using isopropyl alcohol tomorrow.
[02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:51.990]  I'm just going to rinse them really good tonight, really, really good in cold, cold water in hopes that all this stuff comes off.
[02:40:51.990 --> 02:40:54.990]  But I'm going to have to work at these bags tomorrow.
[02:40:54.990 --> 02:40:56.990]  I can already see it's kind of caking up on these.
[02:40:56.990 --> 02:41:05.990]  So, guys, look at this 120.
[02:41:06.990 --> 02:41:14.770]  I wish we could have better lighting, but it's blonde, bro.
[02:41:14.770 --> 02:41:17.770]  Stick that sucker in the freezer.
[02:41:17.770 --> 02:41:19.770]  Sundar's over here, poor guy.
[02:41:19.770 --> 02:41:20.770]  Thank you, Sundar.
[02:41:20.770 --> 02:41:28.770]  I appreciate it, man.
[02:41:28.770 --> 02:41:29.770]  Here you go, babe.
[02:41:29.770 --> 02:41:33.240]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:36.240]  All right, so we're looking at this water.
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:40.240]  We see a little sheen on top.
[02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:49.910]  Yeah.
[02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:56.930]  Here comes the 90.
[02:41:56.930 --> 02:42:01.930]  The infamous black bag that everybody wants.
[02:42:01.930 --> 02:42:43.320]  It's coming.
[02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:44.320]  Oh, yeah, dude.
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:45.320]  I'm making faces over here.
[02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:47.320]  This is some good shit, man.
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:51.040]  This is what we get excited about.
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:55.040]  Can you hear me, by the way?
[02:42:55.040 --> 02:43:00.040]  Bro, this looks really good.
[02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:05.440]  Look at the sheen.
[02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:19.010]  I like the Beavis and Butthead shirt.
[02:43:19.010 --> 02:43:21.010]  This is what it's all about, guys.
[02:43:21.010 --> 02:43:30.750]  I am so sorry.
[02:43:30.750 --> 02:43:32.750]  Can you hear me?
[02:43:32.750 --> 02:43:34.750]  That's fucking oil, baby.
[02:43:34.750 --> 02:43:58.560]  Give me some.
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:40.850]  All right, here we go.
[02:44:40.850 --> 02:44:45.850]  You know when someone's eating and the fucking food is good and everybody shuts the fuck up because they're eating?
[02:44:45.850 --> 02:44:47.850]  Well, that's what's happening right here, guys.
[02:44:47.850 --> 02:44:58.250]  This fucking hash is just beautiful.
[02:44:58.250 --> 02:45:02.290]  Truth.
[02:45:02.290 --> 02:45:08.420]  Oh, yeah.
[02:45:08.420 --> 02:45:11.420]  There's a lot of quietness right now.
[02:45:11.420 --> 02:45:14.420]  Yeah.
[02:45:14.420 --> 02:45:26.180]  Let me pick it up like that.
[02:45:26.180 --> 02:45:40.540]  Oh, yeah, dude.
[02:45:41.540 --> 02:45:42.540]  All right.
[02:45:42.540 --> 02:45:45.540]  The 90 is going in the hole.
[02:45:45.540 --> 02:45:53.950]  Look how beautiful that is.
[02:45:53.950 --> 02:46:07.630]  We'll put in one of the other ones.
[02:46:07.630 --> 02:46:09.630]  Yes.
[02:46:09.630 --> 02:46:15.630]  96, 73.
[02:46:15.630 --> 02:46:16.630]  We'll leave it this way?
[02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:24.630]  Yeah.
[02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:29.630]  All right.
[02:46:29.630 --> 02:46:31.630]  Here goes the 73.
[02:46:31.630 --> 02:46:39.060]  You all right, brother?
[02:46:39.060 --> 02:46:41.060]  Stretching out, huh?
[02:46:41.060 --> 02:46:42.060]  Come on.
[02:46:42.060 --> 02:46:43.060]  Let's make hash.
[02:46:43.060 --> 02:46:45.060]  It's going to be fun, they said.
[02:46:45.060 --> 02:46:47.060]  They said, yeah.
[02:46:47.060 --> 02:46:53.060]  Let's go with light bubble hash and make some hash.
[02:46:53.060 --> 02:46:55.060]  They promised me it'd be fun.
[02:46:55.060 --> 02:47:07.940]  All right, what are you doing?
[02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:10.940]  There you go.
[02:47:10.940 --> 02:47:13.940]  I don't want to shake it so much.
[02:47:13.940 --> 02:47:17.940]  So what you do is, brother.
[02:47:17.940 --> 02:47:39.340]  Give it up.
[02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:44.680]  So can anyone in the room hear me?
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:47.680]  No.
[02:47:47.680 --> 02:48:01.990]  Carry on.
[02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:05.990]  No, I know you guys can hear me.
[02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:07.990]  Pedro can't hear me, though.
[02:48:07.990 --> 02:48:20.330]  Yeah, no, I know all of you hear me.
[02:48:20.330 --> 02:48:22.330]  Oh, yeah.
[02:48:22.330 --> 02:48:24.330]  The 90 came out fire, bro.
[02:48:25.330 --> 02:48:32.330]  You're tripping me out right now.
[02:48:32.330 --> 02:48:34.330]  So right on, guys.
[02:48:34.330 --> 02:48:36.330]  We got the 73 coming out here.
[02:48:36.330 --> 02:48:38.330]  Fuck, it's been, what, three hours?
[02:48:38.330 --> 02:48:40.330]  It's been a while.
[02:48:40.330 --> 02:48:42.330]  We only did two washes.
[02:48:42.330 --> 02:48:43.330]  Fuck, yeah, man.
[02:48:43.330 --> 02:48:46.330]  I'm really, really surprised at how beautiful.
[02:48:46.330 --> 02:48:48.330]  I wish you could smell this fucking hash.
[02:48:48.330 --> 02:48:51.330]  It's really pungent.
[02:48:51.330 --> 02:48:53.330]  I mean, it's fresh.
[02:48:54.330 --> 02:48:56.330]  I don't even know what to say.
[02:48:56.330 --> 02:48:58.330]  I can't wait to dry it.
[02:48:58.330 --> 02:49:00.330]  I can't wait to taste it.
[02:49:00.330 --> 02:49:02.330]  I can't wait to just complete the circle.
[02:49:02.330 --> 02:49:05.330]  So let's pick this 73 up.
[02:49:05.330 --> 02:49:07.330]  It's like we have a security camera.
[02:49:07.330 --> 02:49:17.530]  And he's right up against it.
[02:49:17.530 --> 02:49:21.530]  And for some reason, we don't have audio again.
[02:49:21.530 --> 02:49:23.530]  We can hear you.
[02:49:23.530 --> 02:50:11.920]  Yeah, no, you haven't had audio for about half an hour.
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:14.920]  Yeah, definitely not cold enough in this room, bro.
[02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:16.920]  So by the way, where are people watching?
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:19.920]  So guys, you guys notice all this greeting material?
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:22.920]  It's because this room is not cold enough.
[02:50:22.920 --> 02:50:28.390]  The hash is literally melting on our bags.
[02:50:28.390 --> 02:50:33.430]  But that's what we're working with.
[02:50:33.430 --> 02:50:35.430]  It's some good shit.
[02:50:35.430 --> 02:50:41.450]  Look at that.
[02:50:42.450 --> 02:50:47.450]  So if anybody's commenting or anything like that or saying anything,
[02:50:47.450 --> 02:50:48.450]  I can't hear you.
[02:50:48.450 --> 02:50:49.450]  I apologize.
[02:50:49.450 --> 02:50:51.450]  Or I can't see anything.
[02:50:51.450 --> 02:50:53.450]  The phone is pointing down.
[02:50:53.450 --> 02:50:59.450]  And the goal here is to get this hash into this tray as soon as possible.
[02:50:59.450 --> 02:51:00.450]  And I'm going to focus on that.
[02:51:00.450 --> 02:51:02.450]  I'm sorry.
[02:51:02.450 --> 02:51:03.450]  It's okay, dude.
[02:51:03.450 --> 02:51:04.450]  No offense taken.
[02:51:04.450 --> 02:51:06.450]  Yeah.
[02:51:06.450 --> 02:51:10.750]  Exactly.
[02:51:10.750 --> 02:51:11.750]  Exactly.
[02:51:20.040 --> 02:51:22.040]  This freaking tray is cold.
[02:51:22.040 --> 02:51:24.040]  It is.
[02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:38.060]  It is.
[02:51:38.060 --> 02:51:43.290]  No 190 cooties.
[02:51:43.290 --> 02:51:45.290]  All right, here we go.
[02:51:45.290 --> 02:51:47.290]  So this is going in.
[02:51:47.290 --> 02:51:52.400]  I'm going to turn it around.
[02:51:52.400 --> 02:52:02.520]  I'm going to turn the 73 around, and I'm just going to dip it in the 45.
[02:52:02.520 --> 02:52:04.520]  Nah, it's cold enough.
[02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:05.520]  Thank you, Kunda.
[02:52:05.520 --> 02:52:06.520]  I appreciate it.
[02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:12.520]  So whatever residue on the 73 is going to get trapped on this 45,
[02:52:12.520 --> 02:52:13.520]  and we're going to call it quits, man.
[02:52:13.520 --> 02:52:15.520]  That's it for this wash.
[02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:17.520]  There's no more reason to wash that material.
[02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:20.520]  Obviously it's in the planner right now, but that was it.
[02:52:20.520 --> 02:52:27.230]  That's all she wrote.
[02:52:27.230 --> 02:52:29.230]  The 45 is going to take forever to come out.
[02:52:29.230 --> 02:52:32.230]  I can already see it.
[02:52:32.230 --> 02:52:34.230]  Because it always does.
[02:52:34.230 --> 02:52:35.230]  It's so fun.
[02:52:35.230 --> 02:52:37.230]  Wait, can you guys hear me now?
[02:52:37.230 --> 02:52:38.230]  Yes.
[02:52:38.230 --> 02:52:39.230]  I can hear you now.
[02:52:39.230 --> 02:52:40.230]  Oh, shit.
[02:52:40.230 --> 02:52:42.230]  Did you change some setting?
[02:52:42.230 --> 02:52:43.230]  No.
[02:52:43.230 --> 02:52:45.230]  No, no, I didn't change any settings.
[02:52:45.230 --> 02:52:49.230]  I've been trying to talk to you for like 45 minutes.
[02:52:49.230 --> 02:52:50.230]  Yeah, I'm sorry, brother.
[02:52:50.230 --> 02:52:51.230]  I didn't hear nothing.
[02:52:51.230 --> 02:52:54.230]  I'm so sorry, brother.
[02:52:54.230 --> 02:52:57.230]  I'm mostly just glad that we can actually talk now.
[02:52:57.230 --> 02:52:59.230]  Now I forgot all the things I wanted to ask.
[02:52:59.230 --> 02:53:05.230]  But if people can remind me in the chat of the many questions we had
[02:53:05.230 --> 02:53:08.230]  while we could not communicate with you.
[02:53:08.230 --> 02:53:09.230]  Yeah.
[02:53:09.230 --> 02:53:10.230]  So.
[02:53:10.230 --> 02:53:13.230]  I agree.
[02:53:13.230 --> 02:53:14.230]  It's 45.
[02:53:14.230 --> 02:53:17.230]  Man, we got some good hash, Peter.
[02:53:17.230 --> 02:53:18.230]  Oh, sorry.
[02:53:18.230 --> 02:53:19.230]  All right.
[02:53:19.230 --> 02:53:22.230]  So you can hear me, right?
[02:53:22.230 --> 02:53:23.230]  Yeah, we can hear you.
[02:53:23.230 --> 02:53:24.230]  Okay.
[02:53:24.230 --> 02:53:29.230]  So someone was asking a while ago, you personally,
[02:53:29.230 --> 02:53:35.230]  like do you have a certain micron size that's like your jam?
[02:53:35.230 --> 02:53:39.230]  Or do you like to mix them all together and just get like full spectrum?
[02:53:39.230 --> 02:53:42.230]  You know, it all depends.
[02:53:42.230 --> 02:53:45.230]  I like to keep them individually.
[02:53:45.230 --> 02:53:48.230]  But in some sites, like these Sativas,
[02:53:48.230 --> 02:53:51.230]  I'm going to run full spectrum just for myself because I just love them.
[02:53:51.230 --> 02:53:55.230]  But like these strands, I'm going to keep them micro individual.
[02:53:55.230 --> 02:54:01.230]  This particular first run, I'm going to keep all to myself just because I am.
[02:54:01.230 --> 02:54:02.230]  So.
[02:54:02.230 --> 02:54:04.230]  The wife gets none.
[02:54:05.230 --> 02:54:06.230]  All right.
[02:54:06.230 --> 02:54:09.230]  So while we have the ability to talk to you,
[02:54:09.230 --> 02:54:13.230]  everybody reminded me of the questions we had.
[02:54:13.230 --> 02:54:15.230]  The water pump you're using.
[02:54:15.230 --> 02:54:20.230]  Hose attachment.
[02:54:20.230 --> 02:54:22.230]  What he does with the leftover weed.
[02:54:22.230 --> 02:54:24.230]  Does he use it for compost?
[02:54:24.230 --> 02:54:25.230]  Yeah.
[02:54:25.230 --> 02:54:28.230]  You put, you put all that material back in the raised bed.
[02:54:28.230 --> 02:54:29.230]  Right.
[02:54:30.230 --> 02:54:31.230]  That is correct.
[02:54:31.230 --> 02:54:33.230]  All that material goes right back on top of the plant.
[02:54:33.230 --> 02:54:36.230]  Specifically on top of that one plant that we harvested the material from.
[02:54:36.230 --> 02:54:38.230]  So, yeah.
[02:54:38.230 --> 02:54:40.230]  I've been keeping the beds.
[02:54:40.230 --> 02:54:42.230]  Soak and wet.
[02:54:42.230 --> 02:54:44.230]  These past couple of days.
[02:54:44.230 --> 02:54:45.230]  It's been hot.
[02:54:45.230 --> 02:54:48.230]  For that one reason, but this is the 45.
[02:54:48.230 --> 02:54:49.230]  Peter.
[02:54:49.230 --> 02:54:50.230]  It's the last of it.
[02:54:50.230 --> 02:54:52.230]  And for a 45.
[02:54:53.230 --> 02:54:55.230]  The money shot.
[02:54:55.230 --> 02:54:57.230]  And then.
[02:54:57.230 --> 02:55:02.690]  And then people wanted to know what kind of pump you're using.
[02:55:02.690 --> 02:55:04.690]  I'm using.
[02:55:04.690 --> 02:55:06.690]  It's just a regular.
[02:55:06.690 --> 02:55:08.690]  There's some pump from home Depot.
[02:55:08.690 --> 02:55:09.690]  They have two options.
[02:55:09.690 --> 02:55:10.690]  One of them was.
[02:55:10.690 --> 02:55:12.690]  $80, $89.
[02:55:12.690 --> 02:55:14.690]  The other one was 130.
[02:55:14.690 --> 02:55:15.690]  I bought the one 30.
[02:55:15.690 --> 02:55:17.690]  The other one was $100.
[02:55:17.690 --> 02:55:18.690]  I bought the one 30.
[02:55:18.690 --> 02:55:20.690]  I'm using the one 30.
[02:55:20.690 --> 02:55:22.690]  The other one was 130.
[02:55:22.690 --> 02:55:23.690]  I bought the one 30.
[02:55:23.690 --> 02:55:25.690]  The only difference is that one has.
[02:55:25.690 --> 02:55:27.690]  Run dry.
[02:55:27.690 --> 02:55:28.690]  Auto shut off switch.
[02:55:28.690 --> 02:55:30.690]  And the other one doesn't.
[02:55:30.690 --> 02:55:35.690]  But they're basically the same flow rate.
[02:55:35.690 --> 02:55:38.690]  If you look at my story, there's pictures on it.
[02:55:38.690 --> 02:55:39.690]  It's brand new to me.
[02:55:39.690 --> 02:55:40.690]  And I like it so far.
[02:55:40.690 --> 02:55:42.690]  I got this idea from.
[02:55:42.690 --> 02:55:44.690]  At deal grows.
[02:55:44.690 --> 02:55:46.690]  Fred.
[02:55:46.690 --> 02:55:48.690]  The funky fast one.
[02:55:49.690 --> 02:55:50.690]  Yeah.
[02:55:50.690 --> 02:55:52.690]  Yeah.
[02:55:52.690 --> 02:55:53.690]  Yeah.
[02:55:53.690 --> 02:56:00.690]  Says.
[02:56:00.690 --> 02:56:02.690]  Someone watching thought it'd be a good idea.
[02:56:02.690 --> 02:56:04.690]  If you shared this run with everyone watching.
[02:56:04.690 --> 02:56:06.690]  Yeah.
[02:56:06.690 --> 02:56:11.690]  Evenly.
[02:56:11.690 --> 02:56:13.690]  And smoke dabs in front of you all day long, guys.
[02:56:13.690 --> 02:56:15.690]  It would be nice.
[02:56:15.690 --> 02:56:16.690]  I wish I had enough.
[02:56:16.690 --> 02:56:18.690]  I wish I had enough.
[02:56:18.690 --> 02:56:21.690]  I wish I had enough with everybody.
[02:56:21.690 --> 02:56:22.690]  I wish I really did.
[02:56:22.690 --> 02:56:24.690]  I really wish I did.
[02:56:24.690 --> 02:56:32.160]  I wish you could smell this.
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:33.160]  Let's go ahead and put this in the tray guys.
[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:38.080]  Give me one second.
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:42.080]  And we froze.
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:44.080]  And I can never tell if like, I'm also frozen.
[02:56:44.080 --> 02:56:45.080]  All right.
[02:56:45.080 --> 02:56:48.990]  Let's go back to me.
[02:56:48.990 --> 02:56:54.090]  Oh,
[02:56:54.090 --> 02:57:06.930]  I'll be smoking some of that. Yeah, I know you've all heard me the whole time. He couldn't
[02:57:06.930 --> 02:57:21.270]  hear me in the room. All right, let's see if he comes back. Many beers deep into my
[02:57:21.270 --> 02:57:45.960]  night. It's been a long day. There we go. He's back. Actually, so by the way, can you
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:54.160]  hear me now? Yes, I can hear you, Peter. Okay, so the thing I found most surprising tonight
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:58:06.560]  is that your phone did not fall in the bucket. No, only soon does it. Only soon does, I'm
[02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:14.000]  sorry. It was a phone. And did he have an on the job accident working the camera earlier?
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:22.880]  Yeah, we were trying to get that golden shot and basically it came from the slip on. It
[02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:38.810]  just fell. Unexpected casualty of war. Unfortunately, my nephew was originally
[02:58:38.810 --> 02:58:43.610]  supposed to be here. Joey, he was supposed to be here to help me wash, but he got caught up
[02:58:43.610 --> 02:58:48.610]  in some traffic on the way back from Vegas. So he didn't get to learn. So we called my buddy Sunda
[02:58:48.610 --> 02:58:53.810]  and he was, you know, I was lucky enough that he came to help me lift some of this heavier stuff.
[02:58:53.930 --> 02:58:59.450]  Normally my wife helps me, but we've been having some, some check engine lights come
[02:58:59.450 --> 02:59:09.770]  back in our back and I got a check in from the dashboard. So, so let's hear from Sunda.
[02:59:09.770 --> 02:59:17.610]  What's up? How are you? You've been quiet all night. I'm digging the Beavis and Butthead shirt
[02:59:17.650 --> 02:59:22.370]  though. Yeah, it's fun. I like watching this stuff. I like seeing the difference between the,
[02:59:23.810 --> 02:59:28.690]  with the machine. I was, I wanted to see how much plant material would actually agitate,
[02:59:29.250 --> 02:59:32.930]  but I think it not having a work bag, it's actually like a surprising,
[02:59:34.290 --> 02:59:38.370]  surprisingly small amount of like planetary. It looks like it got grinded up.
[02:59:39.890 --> 02:59:47.330]  So that was pretty cool to see. And basically Pedro implied that you've smoked a lot of hash
[02:59:47.370 --> 02:59:53.370]  from a lot of producers. Is that correct? Yeah, I just, you know, I like to try all flavors and
[02:59:53.370 --> 02:59:58.170]  stuff and ground just to even see, like when I see a new turf profile hitting the market,
[02:59:58.170 --> 03:00:01.290]  I see a lot of people running it. I'll usually like to try it and see whether it's,
[03:00:02.410 --> 03:00:06.410]  they're growing it just because it washes well and it's more of like a producer strain,
[03:00:06.410 --> 03:00:11.770]  like, like a wedding cake or a, or a glue or if it's actually something that it tastes nice and
[03:00:11.770 --> 03:00:15.610]  is more of a, you know, something that somebody grew for, for hashing and for actual turps,
[03:00:15.650 --> 03:00:22.210]  you know? And so how would you... Anything that I know from new strands, I learned from Sunda.
[03:00:22.210 --> 03:00:27.090]  Like I keep saying, I keep telling people I'm stuck in this cave. I haven't... Yeah,
[03:00:27.090 --> 03:00:31.410]  no, that's what I like. That's what I'm saying. He's like your hummingbird who goes out there and
[03:00:32.610 --> 03:00:37.970]  brings back information. Exactly. He knows all the cool people, you know what I mean? I'm just a...
[03:00:37.970 --> 03:00:42.930]  And validates what you're doing. He's like, you're doing some seriously good work, dude. Just
[03:00:42.970 --> 03:00:47.210]  stay the course. Apparently I haven't even had the melt here yet. He last run,
[03:00:47.210 --> 03:00:53.640]  or when I met him, he was at the end of the lower microns and second washes and stuff.
[03:00:53.640 --> 03:00:59.400]  That's what he told you. I just finished it. I'm so sorry.
[03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:06.520]  Actually, I really had some really nice melt when we met at the history of Rosin in Venice,
[03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:14.120]  but nowhere near what, you know, Blue Ice Tech was doing, man. Holy shit. I saw his stuff,
[03:01:14.240 --> 03:01:20.240]  it was pure inspiration. Yeah, no, I love that he busted out
[03:01:21.440 --> 03:01:30.720]  like five different... He was researching consistencies and everything. Yeah, absolutely.
[03:01:32.240 --> 03:01:35.520]  That was a cool event that Speakeasy should try and do something like that again.
[03:01:35.520 --> 03:01:37.840]  That's where I met Pedro. Yeah, that's where we met soon after.
[03:01:37.880 --> 03:01:43.800]  Coronavirus happened. Yeah, when this shit ends, we're going to have some
[03:01:45.480 --> 03:01:52.520]  opium style Hashden events. So right on, guys. I think we're going to go ahead and button it up
[03:01:52.520 --> 03:01:58.600]  here. We got to put this hash in the freezer and we're going to button it up. We're going to start
[03:01:58.600 --> 03:02:06.440]  cleaning up in here. It's late. We accomplished everything we wanted to accomplish. It was a
[03:02:06.480 --> 03:02:10.960]  little bit of a shit show. It's part of the learning experience that we do here indoors.
[03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:17.600]  I hope we were a little entertaining, at least a little bit. And I hope that someone learned
[03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:22.560]  at least a little bit. It might not be the right way to do it, but it's like I keep saying,
[03:02:22.560 --> 03:02:28.400]  it's my way. It works for me. There's probably 200 billion ways to do it better. But yeah,
[03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:35.600]  if I can end this with, you know, I dare everybody out there to put some seeds in the ground and grow
[03:02:35.640 --> 03:02:43.640]  some medicine and grow your own vegetables. It's just it's a good thing. So I think we're
[03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:49.720]  good to go here, Pete. I wish that we can go live when this freeze dryer finishes drying.
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:57.880]  Maybe if this COVID thing allows us, one of these days I would like to do meat with you
[03:02:57.880 --> 03:03:01.960]  like you guys used to do on Tuesdays and smoke out of that hookah.
[03:03:01.960 --> 03:03:05.160]  We could do that next week at Tom's house.
[03:03:05.160 --> 03:03:07.960]  Fuck yeah, let's do it. Now that we got all this hash bro, let's smoke it.
[03:03:09.400 --> 03:03:14.760]  I strongly, I don't think anybody would not take you up on that offer right now.
[03:03:15.640 --> 03:03:23.400]  Yeah, right on. So for most, I want to thank you for everything you do. I want to thank Sunda for
[03:03:24.040 --> 03:03:30.440]  helping out. I want to thank my lovely wife, Leah, for being my road dog to thick and thin.
[03:03:30.440 --> 03:03:36.760]  I wouldn't be here without you, baby. So yeah, thank you, Peter. Anything else can I add to this?
[03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:42.760]  I think that's the mic drop. So we're good.
[03:03:42.760 --> 03:03:44.840]  Right on, brother. Thank you very much.
[03:03:44.840 --> 03:03:52.360]  We appreciate it. And yeah, everyone, wherever you are, I have no idea where people are. But
[03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:57.320]  anyway, go to bed and we'll see you probably tomorrow.
[03:03:57.320 --> 03:04:05.800]  Yeah, I'll see you soon, brother. Thank you very much, man. Peace, everybody. Thank you.
