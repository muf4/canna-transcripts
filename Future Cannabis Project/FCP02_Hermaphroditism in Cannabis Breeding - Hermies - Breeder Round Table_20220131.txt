Hello everyone can you hear me? Am I coming through auditorially? Yes I am
coming through the audio and I am entering into the room in a moment we
have Breeder Roundtable happening right now. Don't miss out get started and here
we go let's roll right into it yeah.
You're welcome to join but I figured we'd uh we could bring in your
your your news maybe like 20-30 minutes into it. Sounds good. You can just hang
out you can just hang out on the stage and chill and the concept of Clubhouse
is you can chime in whenever you feel like it so it's a whole bunch of
breeders talking about topics related to breeding and wherever we wander off to
topically so it's a somewhat structured but mostly loose and open-ended. Very
cool glad to be part of it with you guys. And London just let me know when we're
ready on the YouTube side or actually let me see if I can hear myself. Check
not yet so basically we're broadcasting this to YouTube and yep now I can hear
myself. Okay so I think we're live so I guess maybe the one and only Mr. Toad do
you wanna do you want to kick off the topic and set the table? Yeah man how
y'all doing today? Today we're gonna be going over a topic that has plagued
many a grower from day one homophobism in cannabis and the causations of some
of why we're seeing this. Today we have myself we've got Trevor London and Dan
Grace from Dark Heart Nurseries on here today so anybody got any questions any
experience with this happening feel free to jump on in we appreciate it.
Yeah and I actually just had it happen to some plants growing in LA in the
winter so it's a timely topic but do you I guess Tony do you want to kind of talk
about things that you know environmental stressors or what what are some other
what are some of the many things that can lead to hermaphroditism? And Dan you
can jump in here too as a man who probably knows the thing or two about
the topic. Boy I wish we knew more about it it's so complex right probably a lot
of people on here know more than me but you know what what we do seem to know is
there seems to be some kind of interplay between genetics and environment you
know where these environmental stressors will kind of start to trigger
hermaphroditism in plants but it is it is a complex interaction and it's still
a lot for us to get to the bottom of. Yeah in research that's been shown that
it can be triggered from many different things from cold to different hormone
interruptions if you interrupt ethylene in a female during crucial periods of
reproduction she's going to try to throw out stamina flowers or sterile staminones
it can happen from actual mechanical damage to the plant that can trigger
different issues inside the plant from these abiotic stresses there's just so
many different levels of issues that could compound that could create what
you're seeing and you could actually see this show up in a plant in one round and
then never show up again in your own garden so it's something that can is
very variable it's not going to always show up usually when you find these
these weird plants that are showing these hermaphroditic traits in the lines
that aren't minocious. I mean you know traditionally light interruption and
you know screwing with a plant's light schedule is always kind of the first
thing we'd always look at for a possible source of hermaphrodites but yeah
there's just so many so many others as well. Ryan you want to chime in? I'm just
kind of getting caught up in conversation seeing where you guys are
at. We're at the very beginning. Kind of setting the table with like what is it and kind of some of the things that cause it. Okay for me I mean we've been
looking at these plants for a long time obviously and discussing this thing I
was quite you know I'm quite blessed to have Rob Clark and David Watson in my
circle and so I've you know I've been chatting with them about this for 20
plus years at this point in time. They pointed out something really kind of
interesting that well at least that I find interesting. I don't think
intersexuality I mean listen we talked about sex as in you know gender, sex,
biological sex in terms of males and females and those are really two like
binary ends of a continuum in the appearance of sexual traits on a plant.
You gotta remember like also when we compare it to like something like humans
you know humans let's say 99.99% of us have one thing between their legs right
and it's either her vagina or a penis but like most people don't have both. But
in humans it's like that's your one shot at sex right.
Cannabis is a little bit different what's a lot different because rather
than having like one one area where they can express either maleness or femaleness
you know like your average bud might have 20 flowers or 30 flowers in it. So
that's really 30 opportunities for you to have either a male or a female flower.
And so you can kind of confuse maleness and femaleness with what is properly
called intersex. It's not hermaphrodite, hermaphroditism. You know if you think
about what a hermaphrodite is in humans or what we call it a hermaphrodite we
actually don't use that word anymore. The politically correct and and also
more technically accurate term medical term is intersex right and that's really
a combination of both male some variation of both male and female organs
in one spot. And so the corollary of that in a cannabis plant would be one flower
that is partially male and partially female. And that's an incredibly
incredibly incredibly rare occurrence when you're looking at intersex plants.
Typically what we have is buds or colas with intermixed male and female flowers
but any given flower is either male or female. And so I think like you know I
think my eye hurts a little bit here like kind of like how people use the
word strain and it's really incorrect to use that. I think it's also really
incorrect to use the the word hermaphrodite and the the proper word
that we should be using is intersex.
Because it you know it describes a condition where the appearance is
between those two binary all-male all-female conditions right. So that's
like one little point of order. I think the you know the the other thing to
really consider is that the occurrence of intersex plants can happen on either
male or sorry that the occurrence of intersex plants can happen on genetically
female or genetically male plants. And we shouldn't confuse intersex as like a
third you know again biological sex right. Like there really are only two
biological sexes. Maleness which is conferred to in cannabis by X Y you know
that an XY condition on the 10th chromosome set and females being XX
right. And so when I look at when I define male plants and female plants it
really only has to do with is the plant XX or XY. And and that's the that's the
divide that's how you divide the population into males and females. You
can then look at any male or female plants and say is that plant does that
plant have some gene that pushes it into the intersex phenotypical expression.
Okay but really those genders are either still they're still either male or
female. It's just that the modified expression of the appearance of those
traits is influenced by this extra condition which we called intersex. So
I'm gonna leave it there and if there's any questions or points you know at
least I just don't to go too far or too far too far forward. Anyone? I think you
intimidate everyone they all get quiet. Sorry I'm not trying to come off
intimidating I just you know I just want to bring a different perspective. Again I
think it's like again like strain it's hermaphroditism is one of those words
that we've been using incorrectly for so long that it's kind of ingrained
into the population. But again I just I think it's important for people to look
at these and we know we can talk at one of these papers that that Mr. Toad put
up this a couple days ago I think he actually posted in public as well but
it's a paper on hermaphroditism and cannabis by an author named Zamir
Poonja and he's out of the University of Simon Fraser in British Columbia. And
anyway he does a whole treatise on it and they did they they show that when
you when you self fertilize an intersex plant or at least an intersex plant from
their population that all the offspring are genetically female especially if
you're looking at the genetic markers of the plant. That the offspring from an
intersex self cross are all genetically female but a portion of those plants
have the intersex phenotype and the reason is the reason that is is because
intersex is actually a separate trait from maleness versus femaleness. Okay and
I think it's important for people to remember that that's kind of all I was
saying. Yeah and I'm glad you brought up phenotype. This is something people need
to understand about what they're seeing with hermaphroditism or the intersex
trait. It's a it's a phenotype of the male or female that you are growing in
your garden. Like you said either one of these can show the intersex trait and
when we had to show about phenotype people are are confusing phenotype with
the whole entity and not the actual traits that entity expresses. So when we
dig into these things and if you want to take just the sexual trait as being the
one trait that we're trying to deal with like a genocious line that has females
only and that being our only trait in the mono hybrid we're creating that's
genocious that becomes something that can be expressed through different
phenotypical expressions right. There's going to be a different degree of how
many male flowers will show up on a female plant when it shows this
intersex trait. It may show full sterile staminas that come out and look
like they're going to be male flowers but never produce full anthers or or
produce clusters that could pollinate your plants. They're not going to produce
viable pollen. So there's different expressions of this intersex trait that
people are seeing and people are always under the impression that it is one or
it is the other when it could be a variable shade of different colors
coming from this plant and from the traits that's expressing. I think that's
an interesting phenomena that that we've seen as well. One thing we talked about a
lot internally you know I mean expressing or forcing hermaphrodites I
guess as you call them is a part of the breeding program too of course for
feminized seeds. So we talk about this a lot both in the context of how to prevent the
formation of of herms in the wild so to speak and how to also encourage their
promotion in the strains we're trying to breed for with our fema seed
products. And you know it's interesting because there's problems on
both ends right. We have varietals out there that will not produce male flowers
regardless of how we treat them. If we you know try to force them to
reverse or anything else they just won't do it and never do it. And then we have a
whole host of varietals on the other end of the spectrum some of which will sort
of recalcitrantly produce flowers only every now and then and sometimes without
any viable pollen whatsoever even when we're we're trying to force them to
reverse and others that will of course you know do this spontaneously and
sometimes some varietals even quite quite readily. So it's I guess I'm not
the geneticist but I think our geneticists would say it's it's almost
certainly a multi-gene interaction with some environmental overplay but pretty
interesting stuff. I think Ryan should just keep talking for about 15 more
minutes it'd be great. No it's cool I'm just out here layering hay down in the
beds trying to do some winter prep so I'm kind of in and out here. But I did I
was curious specifically on topics of breeding you know when when you have the
reverse reversal process going on I'm interested to know maybe from Dan or
Ryan or somebody about you know the stress that the plants are under a
biotic or biotic stresses I've heard that if the stress if let me say let me
say I phrase this if you're reverse sexing a plant and producing pollen and
you're pollinating that on a female plant and those plants are under a high
degree of stress I've heard that the offspring will have a higher degree of
this intersexing and but I've never actually seen it just like one of those
things that people talk about all the time but I've never seen any study that
shows that. That's what I'd like to I'd like to sort of I'd like to figure out
the answer to that question if it is if we can and then maybe also discuss you
know this like certain certain varietals like GMO or aka the garlic cookies is
you know notorious for throwing off intersexing but most of the time that
I've seen at least that maybe someone can chime in but I've seen just sterile
pollen so it's like what what in the plants gene you know makes it produce
sort of sterilized pollen versus you know it not so anyways all right I'll
see you the floor. That request for me to keep talking really sounded a lot like
dance monkey dance. Anyway I'm just kidding. I think that's a good way to you
know so the way that I kind of approach all these studies is because look there's
all these unknowns right like we talked about like plant stress well what is
plant stress right like are the plants parents getting divorced you know I mean
like it's just it's kind of like this umbrella term that we throw on plants
and say oh they're undergoing a stress stress where it's like oh maybe it's too
low pH or fluctuating light conditions or fluctuating temperature conditions or
whatever there's a whole list of them. I don't think that's really informative
and so I think the best way to look at these is probably to look at the work
that we do know and and and say what are the facts that we know for sure are true
and then kind of build up from there and so some of the work that Trevor came
across which is the only person I've ever seen mention it is by this author
out of I think she was working in England but she's French. Actually it's
Belgian and her the her name is Anne-Michelle Faux F-A-U-X and she did a
whole bunch of work on QTLs or qualitative trait loci that are involved
in the occurrence of intersexuality and so for those of you don't remember or
weren't here we talked about it previously QTLs or qualitative trait
loci it's kind of like the other end of the spectrum from a monogenic trait so a
monogenic trait either you have it or you don't and you know we can do Punnett
squares because it's a simple gene interaction we're only looking at one
gene location on a chromosome any given plant has two versions of that gene and
so it's really an interaction between two alleles. QTLs are what we call
polygenic traits so it's like imagine you have a trait that the total outcome
of whatever trait it is we can measure that total outcome might be you know a
hundred that we can we can measure on the plant and say okay this plant is a
hundred it might be that that is the result of ten different genes that each
add a potential additive value of ten and when you total all those things up
at their maximum the maximum was a hundred okay I don't know if this is a
good way of explaining it or not I'm kind of losing myself here but the point
is is that you have ten little genes that each have an additive effect up to
the maximum of a hundred okay with the opposite of the spectrum being zero okay
and so you can kind of think of intersex along that same
but you know it's like it's like each little gene might tip if there's enough
of if there's enough of a genetic barrier if there's enough of a genetic
contribution at a certain location that might tip the plants from female to
producing one or two male flowers other location of the chromosome that also has
a little effect it might not add another like you know another push over the edge
right or independently if you get those two genes together say 20% of the plant
produces male flowers well if there's ten of these genes and they all add up
together to push us into intersexuality right it's it doesn't really matter what
the little combination of which which genes there are is that we know that
there's all these different genes that add together and they all have a little
bit of effect and so this lady and Michelle will flow did a little bit of
work in this with some crosses and I think she did some molecular work as
well I don't have a paper in front of me but she did show that can't the
intersexuality does seem to behave in a QTL type of type of pattern meaning that
there's all these little genes that have a little bit of effect and taken
together in the right combinations that pushes us into intersexuality okay and
and it might be that one of those things has something to do with the
regulation of like ethylene and how that interacts with jasmonic acid or
something might have to do with pH or something might have to do with a
photoreceptor that is detecting light and that these things are upsetting a
hormonal balance that occurs in the plant and it's really when that hormonal
balance gets upset or pushed outside of a normal range that we see the
occurrence of male flowers on a female plant on a genetically female plant
which we call intersex or hermaphrodite right
because you're making me think about really interesting stuff so just under
because basically you know my whole line trajectory is if plants that are
reproducing or stressed will they produce more intersex traits and you
know so what you're describing is like the potential for a plant undergoing
stress changes its hormones does that hormone change potentially affect it
producing different genes like the plants essentially saying oh shit this
is a area that's high stress whether it's drought or heat or whatever and so
I'm going to try to reap change alter the genes to produce more intersex
traits in case there's you know to try to further the progeny down the road I
mean just am I making sense what I'm trying to describe yeah it's interesting
Russell I there's some I have some curiosities about this and you know I
hate to use this buzzword because 99% of the time people talk about it and I
think they use it incorrectly but this is an area actually in cannabis where I
wonder if there might not be an actual epigenetic effect and one of the reasons
that that might be the kind of thing you're describing where you see kind of
environmental triggers start to lead to longer longer term downstream changes
in how the how the genes are actually expressing in the plant and one about
this is that over the years at dark art we've had a number of strains that you
know performed very well for us for quite a long time and in a lot of
different grow environments and then suddenly we would begin to get
complaints about you know propensities towards hermaphrodism and it seemed like
the kind of thing when it's come up where usually we don't go back the other
direction and that kind of that kind of trait sort of continues to persist
generationally throughout the plants does anyone else have an observation
like that with with strains I don't necessarily have any observations
regarding that specifically but I do have a different maybe perspective and a
different sort of insight than what I've heard discussed so far I would love to
talk about it for a couple minutes if you would allow but I didn't come on
here prepared to talk but I do have some ideas in my own. Go for it.
all right so the the way I look at it and the way I look at most things in
this realm is looking at it from nature's standpoint so what was the
ultimate goal for a cannabis plant in nature you know dating back to the
beginning of time with cannabis and you know it's ultimate goal is to reproduce
and carry on its species just like everything else on the planet so it way
I look at hermaphrodism is a survival tactic so when you have what we call
sensimilia a female flower that hasn't been pollinated it's it's not going to
carry on to its next generation so I think that cannabis has developed this
survival tactic or trait to be able to shift its own hormone response giving a
abiotic stress situation it realizes hey you know things are getting bad it's
either you know it's too cold it's we're reaching the end of the season or light
schedules change I'm not pollinated I'm not gonna be able to continue my line
my species so I gotta do what I gotta do to make sure that I can be fertilized
and carry on to the next generation are you with me so far yeah we are I am this
is a pretty common opinion or thing that we hear said often and I I think
it's important to try to remember to not answer profile and to promote buys these
plants their plants you're right in saying that a hormone but hormonal
balance can lead to you know the production of seed in a situation where
it might not otherwise happen those things aren't intentional and they do
increase the what we call fuck was the word like for conditions that is
essentially the ability of a plant to leave offspring right and so you do
increase the opportunity for the plant to be making more offspring but I think
in my opinion is that I don't think that these plants are really sensing
environment it's just that these things happen in nature and they either do or
they don't have an evolutionary advantage right and in this case the
hormonal balance maybe it does offer an evolutionary advantage in some
conditions I had a thought that popped up but Dan was talking just in just a
thought you know you said in recent years or maybe I don't know the
time frame you're describing that this trait was being observed more and more
in I mean with the prevalence of the HLV you know HLV dehopulated and
thyroid you know I'm just curious if that's you know that any type of like
stressor like that would you know potentially trigger the plants ability
to intersect more yeah I think that anybody's saying correlation there you
know I mean in terms of the viroid being a stressor for sure yeah I don't
know total speculation though Dan because there's no genes on the viroid
right so through what mechanism does that happen like there has to be a basis
for that to be able to be oh for sure no like there's still the genetic
interaction I'm just saying that yeah like look I don't I don't think we've
written a paper about this but you know my road infected plants tend to express
more hermaphrodism for sure but I still don't you know my comment was broader
and not related to the by road I mean the dynamic that I described is
definitely independent of the of the by road something else seems to be
happening there if my observation is correct yeah I mean there's weird things
that go on like out here in Willow Creek a few years back a bunch of the early
season runs people were growing a bunch of different cultivars you know like
garlic cookies or sour diesel or any cushions you know through the range of
cultivars and it was an early it was like March April like really early
season depth and it was a weird thing because they're all reporting they're
like yeah the weather's weird it's like this weird hot cold the earth is like
acting weird and all of my plants are intersecting and it was a really strange
thing and no one could figure it out but it was happening on multiple farms many
many miles away you know and the only thing that was correlated was the
environmental changes of the air temperature and rain and humidity you
know weird little fluxes and that so I don't know you know it's a complex thing
yeah I mean you know this is again like all just conjecture based on what I've
observed but you know Ryan you made the point that there may be a few genetic
aberrations kind of leading up to some changes in the hormonal balance of the
plant I sort of am leaning towards that being the mechanism here there's
there's some hormonal mechanic and there's probably a lot of ways of getting
to that place but at some point kind of the trigger gets flipped and some of the
what I'm sort of suggesting is that I suspect that some of the triggers are
kind of one way you know generationally resolving the stressors that the plants
are experiencing may not get you back to where to where you started. Hey everyone
just been listening catching bits I if this has already been mentioned I kind
of caught the tail end of what Ryan was mentioning about the Anne-Michelle Faux
paper and I think that paper is really interesting because it also it highlights
one of the issues that's kind of been touched on and that is not only is it
not only did she identify a QTL or quantitative trait loci she was also
able to identify that there was linkage between the traits associated with male
floral expression in otherwise female background and that it was connected
specifically to light sensitivity which you know for so many of us like the one
thing we had all kind of figured out is light lakes is a very clear environmental
of influence that can cause intersex trait expression but it's really the whole subject
is fascinating and has been it's one of the better researched areas like we we kind of have
cannabinoid research and intersex research and it goes way way way back in both fields
it was cool having Mark Sheldon on in a previous episode where he talked about how you know how
deep and far back the chemistry science goes and the literature on cannabis there but also
Noam de Foom on Instagram he used to go by Coop on the forums he posted and it's stuff that used
to be passed around I know I've seen Ryan talking about this in some of these old papers on the
forums but there's old stuff that refers back to some of the stuff that Toad was talking about
about how mechanical manipulation basically like cutting or messing up the portions of the
the plant mechanically and fluctuations in light cycles fluctuation in temperature
fluctuation in different nutrient regimes have all been associated with these traits and I assume
kind of how Ryan has said that if you were to have these 10 different genes let's this is purely
for the sake of like demonstration not actually we don't know that there are 10 specific genes
but if there are multiple linkages between those genes and environmental variables such as light
sensitivity or other you know nutrient sensitivity or temperature sensitivity things like this
it would make sense that if it's happening in one place that we've identified and the
literature is identified and just you know stoners observing their grows identifying light leaks as a
cause it serves the reason that there's linkages between some of these other genetic traits and or
these loci between the intersex trait and the environmental sensitivity and I think kind of
like as you were talking about Sheldon there is clearly there's some degree of adaptive
nature to this like reproduction it it makes sense and it's been hypothesized and postulated for
years but I also think that it's really interesting if you go into the literature
that minosy is something minosy where both sex types are appearing on a plant is difficult
you can't maintain it in cannabis so it takes intentional breeding practices that constantly
maintain those sorts of population dynamics otherwise you're going to see the plant revert
back to a diocese state and so I think that it's it's there is clearly some evolutionary adaptation
to having the ability to have some intersexuality in a plant to reproduce in stressful environments
it seems to be tied to plasticity and like particularly a response to environmental
stressors associated with light and temperature which you know the fact that it was able to
find a niche in Siberia and develop sort of an auto flower trait like it clearly the plant had
to be adaptable and have some ability to survive in a whole host of extreme environments so this
seems like it's important and necessary but it's not the species itself won't
it won't operate in a minotia or it's evolved to a point where it can't really survive as a
minotious population it will inevitably revert back to diocese and I think that's pretty interesting
yeah again I just I just wanted to go back and say you know like let's try to
reconstruct this like use logic right we know that there's five major hormones in all plants
with cannabis as well we know that blocking one of those pathways the ethylene pathway leads to
again blockade of ethylene blockade of ethylene leads to the production of male flowers on female
plants we know the opposite is true on male plants that we can spray them with ethafon
which breaks down into ethylene in the plant and then that treatment produces female flowers on
genetically male plants we also know that when we play with the gibberellin pathway which is
one of the other five major plant hormones you know if you spray gibberellic acid on plants
sure they stretched crazy on female plants sure they stretch crazy and they get all tall and
ridiculous habit but they also do have they also will produce intercept or they will produce male
flowers and so right there we know that playing with two of the five plant hormone pathways
leads to some version of intersex we also know that alterations in light temperature
ph insect attacks all these things can also influence hormone levels right and so I think
it's really not a stretch to say that hormone levels are going to be playing a key role in what
is in what's causing this and really to really understand that there needs to be some work done
into how does heat or cold interact with hormone levels how does light interact with hormone levels
how do insect bites interact with hormone levels and that's really going to be able to how we're
going to elucidate and so it's like it's really easy to lump everything under this umbrella air
stress this you know this umbrella of air quote stress but without defining that we're really not
getting anywhere so yeah another thing I wanted to say Russell you had mentioned before you were
talking about hormones and changing genes genes are static genes typically don't change throughout
the life cycle of a plant sure there is some background rate of mutation and we know that but
typically hormones aren't changing plants or hormones are changing genes sorry hormones that's
funny you read you read I was like literally asking the question you like answered the question
so my point my question that that would be let me just let me just but dude let me just finish here
for a second because I just want to make the point that's really brief the hormones don't
hormones don't change the genes hormones can change the regulation of genes okay and so that's
really what we're seeing here and I just I just wanted to make that clear because you asked it
before and it didn't get answered so yeah no I that's what I'm trying to understand is while so
what I guess this to hone in more specifically while the plant is producing a seed as the seed
is developing like I don't know the details on it but the plant's coding the genetic future of
that seed right and so while the plant is undergoing stress while it's producing the seed
is the plant changing if the plant is undergoing a shitload of stress is the plant actively
changing the gene inside the seed to be better equipped to handle the stress and you know I mean
the so it's certainly not or almost certainly I've learned in biology nothing is certain almost
but it's almost certainly not changing the gene of the progeny but I think what's uncertain is if
something might be happening to change the expression of the genes even even in the
progeny you know the kind of circumstances that I were describing are usually we're seeing in
clonal propagation but certainly it has been shown that the environment of the parent can
up or down regulate through methylation or what we call epigenetics the expression of
genes in the progeny so you know it's it's conceivable although to my knowledge not
demonstrated that that that could be at play here yeah thanks for clarifying and I apologize I know
sometimes I layman's terms I don't quite specify you know like I'll say gene but you're right it's
the expression of the genes so just keep me corrected with that so yeah I mean something
and look and look for my money I'll put five on it now and I won't bet I won't bet much on
on epigenetics you know anyone around here will tell you that but I'll put five on it right now
that there's there's an epigenetic in your play here with hermaphrodism and cannabis
yeah which is what we like to do in cannabis which is speculate rather than basing anything
on the other but it's here would be a great study a great study would be if you had two
like but let's breed two sets of plants put one in a constant temperature of 82 degrees
and then take the other set of plants and swing the temperature up and down like 40 degrees
every day and then get the seeds off of those reverse plants and then you know germinate a
thousand seeds in each set and see if there's more of a hermaphroditic tenant or you know
intersex tendency between the two groups that would be a great I would love to see that experiment
yeah I mean unfortunately it's probably going to take even more than that we're really going to
have to understand the I think the genes at play here in this and it's likely many right the many
genes at play here in this phenomena so that we can start seeing you know how our plants
with different of these genes how do they express this differently and in what circumstances
but you know Ryan and I and I hear you on having more evidence about this you know the other thing
I've learned especially with biology is is you know as bad as we are in cannabis leaning in
in the direction of folklore scientists can also be at at risk of ignoring the folklore and when
I say folklore in this instance what I really mean is you know the lived experience of of people
around the plant every day I think you know I incorporating that that feedback and those
those lived learnings in the science that we do we can actually have much more rapid and
and really interesting scientific breakthroughs yeah if it's based on observation and not based
on I heard this and you know again I'm not trying to talk smack about the cannabis industry but I've
been in the cannabis industry and living with the plant and the people of the plant for at least 30
years and I'll tell you most of these things when people say it's not based on any observation it's
based on what Joe the grower said down the road right so you know in in terms of looking at like
is are these heritable characteristics by the parents for sure we are there's a heritability
associated with intersexuality like there we we definitely know that as far as how is that happens
like I wouldn't venture into to making a guess whether it's epigenetic or what it is we do know
though for sure you gotta remember when when we have DNA when when we have DNA and it's just
a gene is you know turned into a protein which goes around the body we have this intermediate
step between DNA and protein called RNA right and so a mother plant might transcribe a gene
under the event of stress right again we use the the blanket term and so so some form some form of
stress tells mom to turn on a gene in her in her system maybe in the seeds you know maybe it's a
defensive gene or whatever but that mRNA can actually hang around in the seed and the seed
might not have inherited that gene from mom or that version of that gene from mom but it still
might contain the mRNA that came from mom right um so like for example when you were born and the
your father's sperm interacted with your mother's egg sure the genetics came together in that one
cell but all the other cellular information out within the cell but outside of the nucleus like
we're talking like the mitochondria and you know all the other little organelles that are floating
around in the cell plus all the mRNA that mom had been transcribing that makes an imprint on the
initial clump of cells that you know of of you what you were when you were just as I go right
and so my point is is that there is genetic information within that cell or the progeny
that it doesn't necessarily come from the genetic information of that cell it can be inherited from
the mom right and so that might be one mechanism through which the mother's genes influence the
offspring now you know we're talking about like the first few cells that are inherited it's a pretty
big leap of faith to say that genetic information that was imprinted on those cells is more important
than all the environmental cues and influences that happen to that plant then once it you know
and its life cycle from growing from a seed seedling flowering plant cuttings taken passed
around in my opinion it's much more likely than any regulatory mechanism the mechanisms that happen
on those genes are from that plant's life experience rather than an inherited signal
from the mother's genetics so I don't know again there's no like we don't know any of this stuff
because again all these issues have really never been looked at properly in cannabis or even they
have begun to be looked at in cannabis so we may get some of that information but I think that it's
probably important to realize that most of the stuff that we're talking about and certainly most
of the stuff that has been talked about over the last 30 plus years is really hearsay and speculation
and it's not based on evidence I'm just killing the conversation sorry guys that's all the
evidence I need to make all the speculation I want I think I think you know I think Ryan certainly no
no argument with you that environment is well maybe a slight difference of opinion I mean
it's clear from certainly from our from our work internally that there is a very important
environmental and genetic interplay here so heritability whether that's coming you know
directly through the interplay of the genes or through another mechanism is I would say at least
as important as the environmental interplay I mean just demonstrably that's the case for us and you
see it in our our feminized breeding program I mean we've got you know families of strains that
just won't even you can't can't make them can't make them produce male flowers male pollen no
matter what you do right but what I'm sort of more interested in here and playing with on the
epigenetic side is this and this to your point is is an observed phenomena that this observed
phenomena in which the susceptibility to hermaphrodism seems to change
you know within one generation you know anyway it's a mystery for us but
lots to lots to untie here yeah no there is and I think there's there's another paper
I posted or London reposted another link the first one was just an initial paper by Anne-Michelle Faux
the second one is their full thesis and it goes into a lot of detail and it's just it's a great
link if people are interested in taking a deep dive but there was another paper that came out
more recently I believe the author the lead author was Joe Pettit I could have the name wrong
I'll I'll go find the actual citation but his team followed up on Faux's work and did further
molecular analysis that really demonstrated and confirmed her initial findings just so you know
to add another resource to to people's libraries so that they can can dive deep into these subjects
you know for us at Dark Heart this kind of herming issue is probably
the top if not you know certainly top five cultivation issues that that people have
I'm sure it's one of the subject of talk here something we spent a lot of time
with the science team looking at and trying to determine how we're going to get to the bottom of
it and resolve and you know as and as we've discussed here you know we're interested in
getting at the underlying underpinnings of this but our suspicion is genetically I mean we're
going to be asking ourselves these questions for quite some time because the interplays are going
to be complex and it's going to take I think probably years to really fully get to the bottom
of it and that's why one of the things that our team really hit on as we explored this is that
yeah kind of an epiphany we had internally was you know it's not really like
herms aren't really like an issue in cannabis the issue in cannabis is pollination right
that's why the approach we've taken to address this most aggressively is
releasing sterile varietals which is something we just announced at our
at our event over the weekend the introduction of what we're calling Pistol Guard our
genetically sterile clone and seed varietals which use triploid technology to kind of ensure that
hermaphrodites or you know rogue males you know neighboring hemp crops whatever
will keep our customers crops seed free and you know high yield and high potency as well
how does that stop normal cultivars from being pollinated in a garden though
wouldn't that mean that we would have to grow your specific cultivars for that to have an
advantage in our gardens or is that something that can be utilized by anybody with any cultivar
it can be applied to you know within reason it can be applied to any cultivar
but you do need to create you know Pistol Guard versions of those varietals
um the varietals so it's a brand new plant then exactly exactly the varietals that do contain
this trait they will if they happen to have hermaphrodism the pollen created by those
varietals would also be sterile so your non-Pistol Guard varietals would be protected from that pollen
as well but yes it wouldn't this isn't a technology that you could use to uh without you know further
breeding to just an existing varietal to convey this trait i was just wondering because there's
also with females you could actually just spray the plant at a known time with the ethylene product
and keep the uh plants that are known to throw these stamina traits from actually doing it if
you can time it correctly just alter the ethylene level in that female plant in the garden and
there's an ability to stop that pistol for the stamina formation that's an interesting thought
um you're certainly your um county agricultural inspector would probably take issue with that
approach although it's interesting to think about uh applying a technology like that as a possible
prophylactic it's been used in cannabis for decades um as a way to alter your females that are known to
show the stamina trait then there's also some of the novel plants that have been found out there
like the mac one and even my space cheese females that do not like to be pollinated and very rarely
produce any seeds when they're actually in a room with any live viable pollen um there would be a
way to actually do selection on a large scale to pull these out of particular lines that would
possibly already contain them yeah i mean that's basically what we're talking about here
um is exactly what you described there are we know that there are um you know triploidy and
other ploiding manipulation is uh um a uh trait if you will um that exists in nature and has been
created spontaneously in cannabis um so we're really talking about taking that and focusing
it more to apply it across more varietals um you know for broader use in the industry
dan i don't know if you want to talk about just basic science and tell people i don't know if you
can talk about it but i'd be interested to hear what you have to say about you know what is what
is this triploid tech breeding technology or versus what try is it triploid versus diploid
i'd like to know more about that okay yeah i'll give the kind of the cliff notes on that
you know basics are most cannabis um like most uh people um are diploid right one set of chromosomes
from each parent um but uh unlike people plants can have you know many different uh levels of
ploidy um uh you know some of the plants that we know and love i mean the big breakthroughs were
made in wheat breeding and production when they turned that into mostly tetraploid but also quite
a few different numbers of ploids or of chromosomes rather um so in cannabis um you know it's been
known for a while that we can duplicate we can cause the duplication of ploidy of chromosomes
in the plant um creating a tetraploid meaning that there are two sets of each chromosome for
chromosomes total and what's interesting is if you take a tetraploid um and cross it with a diploid
a conventional plant the resulting progeny is is a triploid and the problem there is that like
in um meiosis when the cells are splitting um and creating those um reproductive gametes
they can't successfully do that when it's a triploid it just is kind of a mess because
they can't evenly split and as a result of that um the plants are genetically sterile
in both directions both the pollen and the um you know both the male and female flowers are
incapable of of reproducing it's just sort of similar i just learned check my facts on this but
uh i was uh told by replicable sorts that this is the same reason that um
mules cannot reproduce actually um so if you want to kind of think of it that way
that's basically what we're um what we're causing um plants to do in the cannabis space
so are most cannabis plants that we're working with are they diploid is that
that's right that's right one set of chromosomes from each parent
so and you said you're using tetraploids to breed into the diploids exactly exactly so how do you
get to the how do you get to tetraploid so um to create the tetraploid we we do you know there's
i mean there's a few steps in it this is kind of the work that we've had to put in it it's um
conceptually simple but operationally a bit challenging um but conceptually uh you know we
use a chemical treatment that causes um the chromosomes within the plant cells to um replicate
so you know it gives a direct copy of the chromosomes that already exist and the resulting
cells have um instead of two they have then four sets of chromosomes and then when those cells go
through meiosis and split in the reproductive organs the reproductive organ the gamete is
has two identical copies of the chromosome and those carry over to the one copy from the
diploid parent and you get a progeny that then have three sets of chromosomes
thanks for the little science lesson there
yeah it's pretty fascinating stuff it's one of the cool things about plants man biology has uh
all sorts of ways to uh surprise you yeah so we're you know we're pretty excited about it we think
it's going to be uh you know a really um great way to really head off some of these um pollination
i mean you know when you think about it we've been you know in the cannabis industry as producers
going to great lengths for 50 60 years to maintain since a million crops whether that's uh through
roguing males or creating feminized seed or i mean arguably even like a clone operation like ours
is a big part of setting up a sense of area um production operation in cannabis so we think that
um you know by getting these uh pistol guard triploid seeds out there more broadly that
will really be able to take a lot of the work and the uncertainty out of uh out of the cultivation
for for farmers dan can you talk about i mean i i know uh oregon cbd is also working on the
same concept can you kind of talk about how you see the market playing out for uh diploids
yeah um yeah for sure um i mean you know we'll be so we're this year we're introducing these
um to our we've a commercial trial program we work with our um customer base where we introduce new
genetics and technologies um directly into a few of our partners farms for evaluation and
and make sure that uh you know that they're liking it and we like it kind of put out the
best stuff so this year we're launching uh probably about three or four of these pistol
guard varietals into our commercial trials program both as clones and seeds and then
we'll be coming to market with both form factors clone and seed more broadly next spring and we
should by then have uh we've worked out the process pretty well internally so we probably
have a dozen or more varietals on offer for next season you know over time i would say
part of this for us is we're very very bullish on seed as a propagation form factor in cannabis
you know might sound strange hearing it from a company that's uh made their business as a clone
producer over the years but we just really believe the future of the space is is in seed-based
production and um you know although this doesn't have to be provided as a seed form factor we see
it definitely as part of our kind of mission internally to um introduce new technologies
into cannabis seed um to enable farmers to to use seed in many more ways and much more broadly in
cannabis ryan what are your thoughts on uh kind of the emergence of sterile plants
yeah it's interesting i mean it's been people have been chasing this for a long time
um i think this is the first i've heard of them being truly truly stale sterile the
the oregon cbd guys they've been having small degrees of uh of seeding and uh watson and rob
clark when they did this experiment years and years ago they made plants that were
they were triploid but they they may have had some form of mosaicism when you do these tests
or when you do these um manipulations on plants on ploidy you can actually end up with what we
call sectors of a plant so you might have a plant that has in some areas you know you don't have a
full triploid and and anyway they had plants also that were like that were triploids and they were
having some degree of what dave called whiteys i don't know if you ever made seeds when you end up
with a lot of white seeds they're hollow and um they're like they're kind of just like seed house
shells they're they're they're just as much of a pain in the ass it's not really a solution because
that those whiteys get caught up they're about the same weight as the actual plant material so
it's hard to even separate them by weight um but yeah it's an interesting concept i think it has a
lot of potential again you know on a gene interaction level triploid plants have three
sets of chromosomes so you have three genes interacting with each other not two um i think
breeding those types of plants is complicated once you know especially when you get into actually
working with the with the the tetraploids um i i personally believe the cannabis needs a little
bit more work before we really can truly truly take advantage of all the benefits of
say you know tetraploids or even hexaploids um
and that we need to kind of stabilize the genome a little bit more
increase the level of heterozygosity um before we go up to you know we double the number of
chromosomes so um yeah it it has potential are you guys really getting 100% sterility like have
you done really good tests where you're saturating those plants with pollen and and ensuring that
they're they're completely sterile uh we'll be evaluating the sterility level um more in our
trials this year um some of the dynamics that you talked about ryan are are definitely um important
uh parts of what we've learned over the last year and a half um developing the technology
what we call um mixoploidy is a major um factor in the successful production of
triploid plants and cannabis um which has to be overcome um you know most uh methods for creating
tetraploids frankly will result in uh varying levels of mixoploidy and you know for the rest
of the audience what we mean there is like some of the cells are tetraploid some are diploid some
can be even other numbers of ploidy right and as long as you're basically what you've created is
what's called a chimera there's you know the plant itself contains basically different um
cells with different dna in this case the same dna different amount of chromosomes
um but uh if you don't deal with that then then of course the progeny of that plant will have
will also be mixoploid right so if you crossed a mixoploid plant with a diploid you'd have
some diploid children and some triploid children presumably um so yeah that's a hugely important
and of course it can have the type of impact that you're describing uh with greater greater or fewer
seeds in the uh in the cross i mean that said even a crop like uh you know seedless watermelon
which probably everyone's familiar with will often have you know varying degrees of like abortive
seed and stuff like that so um we'll know more about the exact interplays there with the abortive
seed as as we as we kind of complete the trials process um internally we see some but very few
um abortive uh border seed as you're describing
and what are some of the initial cultivars that you're putting through this process
not announced yet peter not announced in fact not even named yet in some cases so
let's uh hold the horses on that till later this year got it
any uh questions from the peanut gallery let's let's put it this way peter what would people
like to be to have uh in uh sterile forms i wouldn't like any of the common cultivars that
i love to be altered into a sterile form i'd prefer that you guys just came up with your
own versions of whatever you guys love with the stuff that i've been smoking for 30 and 40 years
i don't want it to be altered until form where i can't read i want this plant to always be able
to survive in the wild without me you or anyone else involved and if we keep playing god with
this plant when we aren't there to do that what happens to the plant is what i'm worried about so
my answer is i don't want any cannabis that i know or that i've read or that i smoke to be
that i've read or that i smoke to be altered in that form that's just my opinion though
there'll be a divergence there'll be the divergence between large-scale commercial
ag and then our homegrown backyard a group that will feel that way it'll it'll i mean i understand
it for um stuff like fiber and oil and seeds but for cannabis that i'm smoking that i want to ingest
in my body if it if it's not for making walls out of or burning in my engine i don't want it to be
altered in any forest just i feel and i can see in the comments and on youtube that's a majority of
the cannabis community feels the same way they they feel that taking a plant and trying to alter
it genetically to put it out in a protected form isn't farming and we a lot of us come from this
in an organic fashion where we want to return back to the earth more than we take from it and
we a lot of us feel that when we start to alter that plant in that way we're taking more than
we're giving back to it because we're only looking at it in a way that we can profit from that plant
the because what we're actually doing when we do this is to try to change what this plant spent
millions of years evolving to become and it just seems like we could do that with something else
besides this beautiful plant i have a question i'd like to tease out i think you know it's a really
important point and i just want to i definitely want to address um you know because this is kind
of a new technology in this space it's important to get at but you know at first i want to say like
it's important for people to understand there's absolutely nothing inorganic about what we're
doing here in fact it's a totally natural process that incurs occurs spontaneously in nature all
of the time and uh you know and furthermore just like from a cultural and perceptual you know
standpoint we totally agree with where you're coming from as an organization and see it the
same way it's not a technology that we're going to apply to all of our genetics by any stretch of
the imagination we continue to offer um genetics that uh growers you know that will not be sterile
and people can continue to breed with at home or cultivate at home or or on their gardens uh you
know to the extent that they want but you know we do think that this is going to be a great um
innovation one that that you do see in in organic and inorganic farming across many many different
crops and you know we're really excited to give farmers the opportunity to to work with this
because the thing is is it sounds like people are just trying to treat this like it's wheat or it's
corn or it's grapes and that's the thing about cannabis where we come from i know where we're
going in the future it's not just going to be something that we smoke and use as a mind-altering
substance and that's why i say i don't understand why not that you guys have but i'll use as an
example we'll just say blue dream because everybody knows that if we end up with an
altered version of that there's only one reason that you would have a sterile blue dream and it's
not so that you could grow more fiber from it or more seeds because you're actually stopping the
seed production like the seed produces one of the healthiest oils on this earth for the human
body it's got some of the greatest ratios of omega-3s to 6s and 9s that we could take
and get anywhere in nature and that that's one thing that i find odd when we try to alter the
seed production ability of that plant not that you're trying to change all of them but that's
kind of where it ends up heading towards when we try to remove the ability of that plant to
reproduce itself well we already have the ability to offer clean clones to anybody and any in a male
or a female that we know is stable for any of the traits that we're offering it for to produce a
version of these plants that are already out here that other people already created like the blue
dream or anyone is kind of taking what someone put their heart and soul into it can i ask you
commercial product yes sir 100 so i i couldn't see or i didn't see who was talking about how this
naturally occurs um in plants and i'm curious to how far back you've looked in the research
when this naturally occurs or is it something that may have been like a environmental thing
with all the pollution and chemtrails and all the crap that's happened across the world
that may have caused this sterility to happen naturally um yeah i mean you know so the formation
of um i'm gonna speak a little bit outside i hope you'll forgive me ryan i'm speaking a little bit
outside of my wheelhouse here so i hope i don't trend too far towards the uh old wives as you're
sort of warning but yeah the this type of manipulation of ploidy level typically happens
in like the meiosis uh stage when when the cell sort of replicates dna and so typically the way
this would naturally happen is there would be some kind of um some kind of failure of the um
of the meiosis um so you know impartial uh or incomplete rather um separation of the two
chromosomes as the cell would go to divide um could lead to this kind of um changes in play
it could be and that could look like a few different things you know it sounds like a
mutation to me is it not well i mean technically it's distinct from like what you would call like
a genetic mutation it's not a you know it's not a mutation of the dna itself but it's a
it's a mutation in the sense that you know through errors in the replication process you get this
kind of novel um change in the ploidy level and then of course you know just in the same way that
we we create triploids um you know if you have a gamete you know a pollen or a or an ova that um
reproduces from a diploid to a tetraploid you would get a triploid like this now
that said you don't see of course you you're not going to see selection to a triploid crop
because the triploids are sterile so nature is going to select across these or against these
rather right but they definitely absolutely do crop up in nature and it's kind of interesting
actually when sometimes we find novel varietals even within cannabis in fact i'll put a spoiler
out there right now we've got a you guys know the emerald conference coming up next month i think
one of our scientists will be presenting a paper at at that conference revealing some details about
um triploids that we've actually found um uh from spontaneously out in the in the uh
cannabis space varietals that you guys probably already know and love
well i appreciate you answering that for me we're trying to get me to understand that
in a sense thanks for taking your time hey i have something i'd like to tease out that might help the
audience understand it a little better do you want to try to describe what the difference is
between this um you know chemical process of creating the tetraploid and breeding that in
with the diploid right to create the triploid versus something like uh genetic you know assisted
breed or marker assisted breeding or even you know other types of technology that you know like
monsanto's uh terminator genes where you know that's different obviously where it's a direct
i think they're using like a mosaic virus to like sneak in codes into the genetic you know into the
genes of the plant where like i don't know the details but actually that's more with the bt
toxin but anyways i'm kind of tangenting here i hope you understand what i'm saying where where
like what's the difference and what's if there's a safety mechanism in what you're doing because
you're not producing seeds you're not the plants aren't the plants aren't producing any pollen
that can spread and theoretically spread on for you know like seeds that's not occurring
right yeah so there's a couple things that had played there um i mean first you know unlike
fisher and the other genetic techniques that you're talking about there's we're really not
changing any dna here right that's that's the important there's no genes inserted there's no
genes you know uh turned on or off um intentionally you know in any way right all we're doing is we're
taking the you know the chromosomes the genes if you will we're creating an extra copy
in the way that you know the plant would would do itself um under certain circumstances as part of
its normal cellular replication right um and then i think you know the other point um you
may think that was russell right um the other point there is that you know sometimes especially
with like gmos the concern is always like well what happens when these you know transgenic genes
or traits like sort of you know leak out into the wild right leakage is a big problem right um you
know and like anyway there's been a number of problems with transgenic leakage into crops right
um and you know in part you know it's kind of interesting here because of the innovation itself
being sterility you're not going to have um any kind of i mean any kind of leakage you know these
triploid traits inherently are are self-defeating so you shouldn't see um any transference into a
general general population wild population or anything like that
russell the way it works is that usually it's done with a chemical called colchicine there's
a couple other ones that are also used or ryzolin and whatever but colchicine fit what it does is
it inhibits the formation you've probably seen the picture of this before when like
you know when a cell goes to double what happens is the chromosome the the nucleus essentially
kind of unwinds and the chromosomes double they they double right so you end up with
two copies of every chromosome and
it within the cell those chromosomes all light up at what's called the metaphase plate but it's like
you can kind of think of it as they line up along the equator of the cell and then one copy of the
double one of the two of every chromosomes in the in the cell they kind of attach to these little
pulley systems that are that are built in the in the cell called spindle fibers and those chromosomes
travel along the spindle fibers towards the the poles of the cell or to opposite poles of the cell
and what happens is then once those chromosomes have migrated to the poles the cell is able to
pinch together in the middle and essentially form two daughter cells from that um you know that that
state each one of the daughter cells has a perfect duplication of the genome that was in the cell the
cell to begin with okay and so what what colchicine does is it interferes with the formation of those
spindle fibers like that pulley system kind of think of it like that's pulling the chromosomes
to the different ends of the cell and so because that pulley system is broken or kind of is
disappeared you end up with a big cell that has rather than 10 pairs of chromosomes for a total of
20 chromosomes you end up with a cell that has 40 chromosomes right um and when when that plant grows
successfully the cells duplicate and it gets into a male flower when it comes down to do
to package those chromosomes up into pollen grains or gametes you end up with a cell that
has 20 chromosomes rather than 10 chromosomes and so when the 20 chromosome plant um fuses together
you know through sexual recombination with another individual we're sorry with a gamete for another
individual you end up with a cell that has 30 chromosomes or three sets of 10 chromosomes which
is triploid and so you're not you know like dan said you're not changing not doing genetic
modifications you're not changing anything other than the normal set of chromosome the the norm
the normal number of chromosomes within a cell yeah thanks for clarifying that that's very helpful
i appreciate it uh i was curious just like with what you're saying about potential mosaicism i
mean is there like when you're doing that process with the tetraploids i mean are all the genes
replicating exactly the same you know is there potential for a little something to occur
there's there's always potential for a little something to occur if you mean like a mutation
but yeah that that i don't think it would be significantly different from any standard cell
because the process the process of gene duplication is actually quite a natural one like we're not
we're not exploiting exploiting any technology the only thing that we're doing
is adding a chemical that interferes with the way that the cells naturally divide okay um
sorry there was something else that you said and i've kind of blanked on it that's okay thanks for
clarifying though this is like i think really helpful just baseline data for everyone listening
to help understand what this type of technology actually is yeah i mean it's present it's present
listen it's present in bananas every banana you eat is a triploid right and there's other bananas
a triploid and and you know watermelons too the the seedless watermelons too it's the same thing
they're yeah right right of course interesting yeah that's a great yeah and there are and they're
organic right it's like you know dan said they're organic it's kind of a funny marketing word
word to say they're organic because it's definitely you know technologies are created through the
influence the the influence of exogenous chemicals but he's right it is a it is a
classical plant breeding technology and it would not be considered gmo um and and listen we've done
this as well you know wheat is like i think you're saying it's tetraploid but there's also hexaploid
wheat and barley um the hexaploid just means six sets of chromosomes so the more numbers of
chromosomes you add the more complicated the gene interactions become at any given genetic locus i
mean to your point ryan this is why uh no one breeds strawberries which for the audience of
our i believe octoploid primarily right uh you're talking about going up orders of magnitude and
complexity as you add more chromosomes to the uh to the crop yeah and and strawberries is actually
kind of a great comparison for cannabis because it also is one of them partly because of the the
ploidy level but it's one of those crops where they essentially plant fields of you know thousands
of individuals and they walk the fields looking for special plants um big berries whatever whatever
the characteristics are and then rather than select those plants and take them into a breeding
program they select those plants and put them into a tissue culture program and they just ramp up the
production of those clones um and then and that's how they plant strawberry fields i mean they're
planting you know clones and clones and clones of these multiplied specific individuals which is
really what we're doing with cannabis as well like that is the the vast majority of cannabis
is grown from that same way someone selects an individual and then it's propagated from clone
from there yep absolutely yeah the difference is that in strawberry they don't do it because i mean
you're talking about decades of uh to create a strawberry seed new strawberry seedling varietal
would be decades and decades maybe longer of work so it's just uh logistically impractical
i had a question um dan you had mentioned that you guys had identified some stuff that was out
in the stream and and already potentially triploid or triploid um and i mean i remember
old guys back in the early 2000s and i'm almost sure i read an article in maximum yield
about treating seeds with autumn crocus bulbs which i believe is a source of colchicine
so i mean it seems like people have probably been messing around with it
for a while just maybe you know not not in a commercial um or or possibly less articulate
fashion does that make sense yeah no it's it's entirely possible um you know of course um we
don't really have any way to know the ones that we found if they were um totally spontaneous and just
you know no one ever knew that that they were um triploid um or if uh you know that the breeder
had been playing with something or consciously doing something um it's uh i don't think we
know this but yeah it's it's possible that uh yeah it's one of the interesting things about
cannabis you know we have a long legacy and doing things um you know privately for a really long
time it's entirely possible that some of this stuff uh did get introduced um generations ago
by someone that was tinkering it's possible but it's in my opinion i would say that it's highly
unlikely i mean it's kind of one of those things where you you soak a shitload of seeds you know
when you when you're working on the protocol if you haven't already figured out the exact
concentration to use i mean these are pretty harsh mutagens and they can actually kill a lot
of seeds and the few seeds that don't die are the ones that are likely to be
um likely to have this altered ploidy level right um and the only way that you can tell if a plant
has a different way there's a couple of microscopic ways you can do by looking at like the the size of
the stomata for example and the leaves the underside of the leaves like the little pores
that do the gas exchange they they're bigger in tetraploid or in polyploid plants but typically
what you do is you treat a bunch of seeds and then you know the ones that survive you take
dna samples of them and you put them in a machine called a flow cytometer and a flow cytometer it
looks at quantifying the amount of dna in a cell and usually they'll use like root tip squashes so
you take a root tip you cut it off and you squash it then you feed it into this machine and the
machine is able to essentially get a measure on how much dna is in a given cell obviously
a cell with three sets of chromosomes has 50 percent more dna than a cell with two sets of
chromosomes so you're not looking at the the constitution of the dna or the genetic sequence
or any of that stuff you're only looking at the total amount of dna and so by looking at the total
amount of dna if you find plants with cells that have like 50 percent more dna in them it's likely
that they're polyploid right um there's other ways to do it i mean you can do what's called a
karyotype where you essentially you you know you you get a picture of the of the of a given cell
when all the chromosomes are in their um they're like they're bundled up state right so when the
chromosomes like for some period of time in the cell they look like big loose piles of like of
string but when the cells go to divide they kind of form into that x shape that we're you know quite
familiar with if you if you you know just go type into google shape of a chromosome and you'll get a
picture of it it looks essentially it looks like a little x but that's like the coiled up dna state
right and so when when when cells are in that coiled up dna state each chromosome is on like
its own individual little unit and so you can kind of line them up by size and count them
so that's another way to do it but those are pretty advanced techniques for some home breeder doing um
i'd be surprised if this stuff was was really done to a large degree hey dan i'm gonna ask what what
plants did you can you share what plants you found that were triploid naturally
or before they came into your possession i should say you gotta wait until i don't want to spoil our
team's uh release there was a couple more weeks out right is the uh emerald conference down in
san diego they're going to present a paper and they should be talking about it down there so
you're just teasing us all are you i'm teasing y'all yeah i mean i'm sure they'll publish the
paper afterwards but if you're down there go check it out and ryan thank you for asking the question
i intended to ask but didn't quite get out just the question of how likely is it that people are
doing it intentionally i really appreciate that answer my pleasure dude hey i have a question for
ryan you said that polyploids have larger stomata's i did i hear that right or sometimes or maybe
yeah it appears to be one of the traits that seems quite consistently along with that third
third genome that the there there are a couple of different things that happen but one of the
things that seems to happen is the plants grow like a little bit bigger thicker leaves larger
leaves and one of the things that is consistently noticed or at least reported is that the stomata
are a little bit bigger so they might have different rates they might have different rates
of gas exchange and yeah that's interesting yeah it is really interesting and the other thing really
things quite interesting that seth crawford brought up a couple years ago when they were
talking about their work in that area is that he said some of the plants that they found had
um increased terpene output but i would also wonder if you might have like new terpene profiles
even right because essentially you know we say we got the genes to produce a plant that's made
carofaline dominant and then another set of genes so another chromosome set that is like
terminally dominant and another set that is like miming dominant like what happens when all those
three things are combined together rather than just two of them together right it's pretty
interesting ryan you're hitting on something that certainly we're interested in exploring for for
for um you know future research is there's um so many crops where changing the ploy level has had
outside of this type of sterility has had major impacts on how the crop can be cultivated overall
yields and and stuff like that so there's i think a rich future and and exploring this area and i
mean you know it's like what happened with wheat i mean it can't be overstated i mean we're talking
about hundreds of millions of lives being saved based on improved wheat yields um from uh basically
manipulating the ploidy level of the crop you know so it'd be interesting to see if uh anything
teases i mean same thing with strawberries right the reason strawberries are primarily octoploid
or other various numbers of ploidy is that you get much much plumper you know big big juicy berries
the way we want um you know once you manipulate that ploidy level so uh be kind of cool to find
out if if we um unveil in the future some uh effects like that or like you said in cannabinoids
or other things yeah i don't know who's running the um the visuals for the youtube channel but
peter whoever's doing that someone might want to google like google octoploid strawberries versus
diploid strawberries right and you'll probably find a picture where they show the diploid
strawberries and wild strawberries are like these tiny little fruits right they're really small
um compared to the ones that we eat today and that is one of the consequences of of breeding at least
in strawberry that's one of the complicated consequences of increasing the ploidy level
is that the fruits have gotten bigger right um so yeah maybe maybe some of the stuff does happen
with cannabis cannabis again i don't think that most people have gone past you know diploids
triploids and quadruploids or sorry tetraploids really diploids tetraploids and triploids because
you need the four to make the three um but yeah maybe hexaploid or octoploid cannabis is different
again and you know usually obviously you got to make the tetraploids before you can make the
hexaploids um so it takes it takes time before somebody will actually get to the point of
octoploid cannabis but for sure at some point in time someone will get there
and who knows what the consequences may be it may be nothing right um but it may be and again
these things are usually done for sterility or engineering in sterility um but like dan says
sometimes there are other consequences that are beneficial right and we might see that but i think
for again further work needs to be done and i would also argue that this work needs to be done
with stabilized varieties to really see the big benefits right well to your point about stability
which you know is not mutually exclusive for sure from our perspective and yeah an important focus
of ours but um yeah the because we're increasing the order of magnitude of complexity in the
breeding that's that's the real reason why it's so important to start off with
high quality material before um for starting to add complexity
absolutely i mean it's hard enough with two sets of genes when you're shuffling plants that have
you know i mean for octoploids you're essentially dealing with eight sets of chromosomes
segregating into patterns of four and so if you had like you know even four different chromosome
haplotypes that gets really complicated in terms of like punnett squares i mean
mr toad imagine the punnett square that you'd have to do if it was like you know big a little a
medium a you know big a you know it would be insane yeah it's like jaren said i think that's
a really good way to describe it is the love and when i was talking there i know you guys aren't
doing a genetic modification of the plant i fully understand that what i mean is by
producing a plant that in nature would not survive that's part of uh the 5500 rule then
they talk about trying to save plants to keep it from bottlenecking and such and that's why i
brought up the fact that there are uses from increased uh amount of uh material biomass that
plant produces like there's reasons why you would want to have more of the stock and more of the
leaf if you're making a biofuel or why you would want more seeds on a plant that's larger so that
you can produce more oil but when it comes to the consumption side of actually enjoying the cannabis
plant i'm one of those cats that's always against uh more grams i prefer more glands so i'd be more
interested in a bigger way to help farmers figure out how to produce a higher percentage of
cannabinoids and terpenes and esters and thials than just truly trying to produce a plant that now
isn't viable in nature that's my whole point can i make a point i just want to push back on that a
little bit um just in this sense look the cannabis that we have today is not the cannabis that we
found you know 100 000 years ago or 50 000 years ago whenever it was the humanity encountered
cannabis i guarantee you that that plant was a totally different thing back then it was totally
different now um so like the question is is it really even the same species at this point in
time right we really have shaped it for our purposes including possibly like really over
emphasizing thc like that really may have never existed in nature until humans came along and
started interacting with the plant so well i agree 100 i've said that 100 times also so i'm not
excluding any of those points out either i've told people that a thousand times that what we're doing
is just we're doing plant genocide by the way we've been breeding for the last 50 years with
cannabis at least if not 100 years when we're just trying to force our own version of this
plant out of it and we've done that with plant after plant after plant from the strawberry to
the wheat plant some of them become plants like wheat that did save millions of people's lives so
you do have to take that into effect eventually we're going to start finding out that what we're
doing isn't the greatest thing for these plants in nature what happens when we're not there with
the breeding that we have been doing even though we're steering by our selection we're still using
most of the time until we introduced the feminization we were using natural ways of
pollination we were using a male to pollinate a female and the production that came from that was
what we were taking when we started to steer this plant in a whole different direction when man
decided that we were going to play god with it and we're doing that with all the things that's
why we started losing all these novel cannabinoids and terpenes that we're now searching for nobody
can find because we didn't take the time to let the plant be the plant and with cannabis it's
something different there's so many novel things that this plant can produce that i just feel that
many of the techniques that we use are reducing the ability for that plant to do that naturally
well you're right if i can uh if i could chime in on here because i have got i think an intermediate
point here which is you know i totally agree with what ryan's saying i mean there's you know i i think
it would be foolish of us to think that there was like kind of a platonic ideal of a natural
cannabis plant that looked anything like what we think of cannabis today but i i i also think that
we um especially knowing what we know today and what we've seen in other crops i do think it's
incumbent upon us as not even so much as individual breeders but almost as as a society or an industry
to be good stewards of of the plant the i think that kind of the counterpoint to the counterpoint
here might actually be in uh bananas which which you brought up earlier ryan as a triploid right
you know banana is a great example right we're we're looking at like potentially the extinct
extinction of of bananas as we know them the cavendish banana at least because you know the
industry has gone to a huge monoculture production specifically of a sterile varietal and that means
that when you get blights as we're seeing with the cavendish it's very very difficult to
you know breed in new resistant varietals that can be introduced certainly without using genetic
engineering techniques and uh you know it becomes does become a very major issue not not only for the
species the crop itself but but also for um you know for human productivity and cultivation of
that crop i got so that's all just a way to say that i think that um that there are um
there and there ends on the spectrum and we gotta we gotta just kind of stay pretty
conscious of what we're doing and certainly make sure that we preserve biodiversity
yeah i definitely agree with that but i mean you know i gotta i gotta say and i'm listen i'm not
i'm not saying uh mr toad's wrong and i'm not saying that you're wrong either
but i'm just pushing back on the idea and presenting a counter argument right for people
to think about the cavendish banana is the replacement banana that was we've already
gone through a banana extinction for the whole industry the original banana that that the whole
world consumed was called the gros michel or the big mike and that that banana went through
the the cavendish is facing called something called oxy it's a fusarium oxysporum race four
and i think that the one that took out the gros michel banana was called race three
um another point that i'm going to make to kind of switch gears here is like you know british
bulldogs are all delivered through cesarean section right like the way that we have bred the animal
it can't give live birth without the intervention with of humans right um does that mean that the
british bulldog is like not it doesn't have a use for humanity right i think we can make that same
kind of argument with cannabis and and some of the things that we do to breeding technologies
to some of these plants we always could we have not found some other animal another dog that
could have done the same thing that that bulldog has done instead of making our own version of a
deformed mutated animal in nature can't live we we can but my point is is that when we interact
with other species we change them right and and i'm not oh i know that i 100 i'm not passing i'm
not passing a value judgment on whether that's good or bad i'm just saying that this is kind of
one of the consequences that we have we always should be i agree with both what you're saying
like i'm don't get me wrong i'm not disagreeing with you natural stands of of cannabis or the
closest things to natural stands or land races or whatever all of that stuff should be preserved it
should be open pollinated put into freezers and it should be protected in its local environments
what we do with the plant outside of those uses and especially if we're doing it in isolation from
those those natural stands i don't think that like i just personally like coming from an educated
point point of view where i studied this stuff in school like
i i don't like i'm not a religious person okay like i believe in science not religion
and so like i don't believe in playing the hand of god or when people start talking about that
stuff it's kind of i just kind of turn off because it's like this idea that god created
a universe where everything is the same and stays the same is insane that's not evolution
we know that like life has changed over and over and over again throughout
time on the planet right and and i just think that it's okay to experiment with plants in ways that
as long as we're not destroying the whole thing like it's okay to try and manipulate plants in
new ways to benefit humanity right that's true but if they're going to introduce sterile plants
to the actual market then that is kind of contaminating the whole thing they're not
keeping it in an environment that's away from the rest of it no but if it's not yeah yeah yeah but
we know it's so far it's not fully sterile well they haven't proven that that's what you asked
through other reports that it isn't so that it gets it gets reintroduced yeah but the parts that
are the instances where it's not sterile is because the ploidy levels allow it to reproduce i
don't think that it's i understand that like it will revert back to a diploid state in nature
so i believe worst case scenario escape whatever germ plasm ends up let's just say
in the midwest in some ditch weed and it becomes endemic there over time in the overall population
with the gene flow that's going on and the reproduction that's happening
in absent human intervention it is not going to continue to be
tetra whatever multi-ploidy it will revert back to a diploid state and i think that this is one
way that we can kind of frame this or just think of this historically and contextually is
all of these arguments like to a t were made about you know fem seeds it's not natural it's
what happens if you know this becomes the norm or the way that all genetics end up getting
reproduced what are the implications for the overall genome and genetic diversity
what are also the commercial implications when you have the inability to reproduce through
traditional mechanisms particularly when people didn't quite understand how the whole process
worked and femmes were to a certain extent you know they were a way of not letting your germ
plasm out and letting people have your male uh component as well at least early on and
so i feel like that whole debate and that whole discussion you know raged on the forums for
the better part of two decades and still comes up here and there um and like this is just a
new set of applications where very similar things are going on we're using exogenous chemicals
to manipulate the way that the plant is able to reproduce and or you know the the ways in which
that sort of happens at a cellular level um i don't think that it has necessarily the germ uh
the genetic diversity implications i think that you know the market's already fucked up a lot of
that shit there are so many different ways and you're totally right the history of domestication
is a process of moving away from wild types to the crop types and it we've seen it in every other
agricultural commodity it gets much more intense like there are millennia of crop domestication
processes that happen the selection pressure is much lower under traditional agricultural
you know methods in different communities around the world and then it gets incredibly intensified
under modern industrial agricultural applications we've seen it time and time again it's going to
happen in cannabis and it's to a certain extent whether or not like we agree with it this shit's
inevitable because there's an interest from consumers to have like or excuse me consumers
in this instance being farmers like there are a fuck ton of farmers who either fight against hemp
being grown in their areas because they worry about pollen contamination or have had to deal
with pollen contamination and so there's a perception of a very real and significant risk
of pollen contamination destroying your crop and a lot of farmers wanting some form of insurance
from that and they're going to adopt the technology that allows them to do that i think that's why
you know if we are worried about it it's incumbent upon us to make sure that we keep on keeping on
doing what we're doing that way the germ plasm that we work with isn't lost and is preserved over time
well and just like fenn seeds that were produced on large scale for hemp once they got out into
the field and they were started to be grown many of those plants started to show hot when they were
tested because the plant and nature decides i'm not doing what you told me to do so once we let's
say we we do take this up on a large scale for large commercial farming for the reasons that
they actually want it for besides what i'm talking about we get these plants out in the field and
they start to show that they aren't sterile on the level they thought what what what's the next level
of us steering this plan into a direction besides going well maybe we need to learn how to teach the
farmers about the plant before we teach the farmer how to grow a jacked up version of the
plant or a new version and that goes for not even just what they're talking about but even a feminized
seed or a seed that's only supposed to produce a specific cannabinoid or terpene profile
when do we decide to teach the people that are going to be farming how to farm i mean you know
there are consulting jobs in that area and some of my friends have taken some of them and that's a
that's a tough road to have there trying to teach chad how to grow but um it's definitely um it's
one of those things that we're there is an enormous amount of canopy getting grown both for hemp and
for thc flower in california and across the country and our ability to like the skill let
the skill level and the skill set is not really matched with the expansion of the industry
um and there's always that's inevitable there's there's always you know growing pains as it were
but yeah i i don't think there's really an answer to that other than eventually they're going to
you know corporations are going to figure out large-scale commercial production and they're
going to continue to improve particularly on their margins and that's you know that's just what
happens as markets mature so the one thing i might just add to the conversation is just from my
own consideration perspective i just i keep going back to this like larger stomata thing i just find
it really interesting so if the plants have larger stomatas you know is that a is that a
is that a phenotypic alteration in the genome well you hold on you can't have a phenotypic
change in the genome those are different things you can have a change in genotype okay thank you
for clarifying yeah phenotypes and genotypes are separate things okay right so so i all i'm saying
is like here's where i'm getting out with this the stomatas right or i wish matt matthew gates
was here he'd be able to really dive into this but from my understanding plants you know open
and close stomatas for multiple purposes one of them being pathogen defense like if the stomata's
open pathogens can enter so if you have a plant with overall larger stomatas the plant there's
a potential for it to have a higher propensity to be able to have pathogens enter those sites
so i'm just there's i have no proof of this i'm just suggesting that i don't know you mess around
with these things and you end up with genetics that might be more susceptible to pathogens
with side effect i don't know but it's a point to consider you know as you're doing all of this
they might be but they also might be more resistant to pathogens right then that's kind of
the point is that like we don't know these things um listen there's another thing i wanted to say
we were talking about what polyploid look triploids are sterile they're not going to breed with anything
else but if you've got a tetraploid and that goes out in the environment that can breed with other
tetraploids and they'll still be like they're not they're not sterile because four and four come
together again and the chromosomes are like the the gametes are balanced so the cell will probably
survive so with this with the stomata being larger and being able to open more would you see
a faster growing plant like would you see its ability to exasperate allow the plant to grow
bigger and faster because of that as well or am i just thinking crazy yeah i mean a lot of you guys
need to go and just do some basic reading on triploids online like if you go to google and
you type triploids and you read like the first five paragraphs like you're going to learn a lot
of this stuff it's pretty standard one of the things that you know that you that happens is
known to happen is that you get an increase in size and plants right um you get it sometimes
you get an increase of vigor and it changes a little bit from species to species but making
triploids is like a standard that's why we have bananas and watermelons that are triploid right
like these are standard what we call like you know air quote breeding tricks that like plant breeders
scientists that understand biology you'll do this stuff because we know that these things have
benefits right and for sure it becomes more complicated to breed and even in some cases
like you're saying like we've already found a gene that's um we call it the s gene in cannabis
it's a powdery mildew gene associated with susceptibility so if you have this gene
you're you're gonna have cannabis plants that are more susceptible to powdery mildew because it's
easier for the powdery mildew to get into the plant like think of it that way right and so a
mutant version of that gene is protective because you're the the gene doesn't work therefore you're
not susceptible to powdery mildew okay well if you take a powder if you take that variety that
has a functional copy of the s gene and you make that into a triploid now you got three copies
of a gene that essentially confers susceptibility to a pathogen right like you'd be much better to
that's what i'm talking about like breeding how we need to tighten up some of our some of our
cannabis breeding work that we've done before we really move into and truly benefit from things
like triploids and tetraploids is that like we have to like because again you don't want three
copies of a susceptibility gene like that's worse than having two copies right um especially if it's
like a dose dependent gene interaction which is often the way it is right um so anyway i don't
know i don't know where i'm going with that i suppose that's where i was going at when i say
when are we going to teach them to farm but it goes for breeding also we're it's it's great that
people are doing this at a higher level than myself and other people in here but it's just
kind of odd that it's going to be passed down to the to that same community that doesn't even
understand what they have in their hands and what they're going to try to do with it the first thing
most of these cats are going to do is going to try to start to breed with it and try to introduce
these plants back into the population right so can i just make a quick point that i wanted to
mention like five minutes ago when you were when you were chatting you you raised this point and
i kind of want to put that back to you again
it's like dan was saying that they may have found some naturally occurring polyploids or at least
maybe they were polyploids that somebody had intentionally made before they got into his hands
and there's no way to know the difference between those two things because it's not like you know
some kind of permanent marker goes on the cell that shows hey this was done by man or this
happened naturally so you may even have if dan if what dan says is true and i don't have reason
to doubt him but i'm a skeptic so i doubt everything that everybody says especially
when they're talking about cannabis and science like i would need him to justify those claims
and show me that those claims were true if those claims bear to be out to be true it may be that
triploids are like a natural thing that already exists in the population right and we just don't
know because we haven't done tests on cannabis using things like flow cytometers right we actually
haven't been it's kind of like those things like i've said this before it's like an analytical
chemistry you're not going to find something unless you look for it right it's like that thing
with the file that came out that one whatever 321 mbt right that skunk compound the reason that
nobody knew that that compound was in there is because nobody did the test to look deeply enough
at the science and say oh look this thing is here it's not right and so it may just be the case that
triploids exist in cannabis naturally at say two percent right and maybe triploids have come and
gone from your garden and you didn't even know it like the thing is we just we don't know until
we look right so i just wanted to make that point yeah i agree that's why i brought up like the
cultivars like the mac one and my space cheese females that don't want to be pollinated
and make seed and when they do make seeds it's on a very minute level compared to anything else
minute level compared to anything else like i could get 30 000 seeds off of one plant and then
the space cheese plant right next to it gives me 25 seeds right on the whole plant and i've ran
repeated tests on these two females that i've had in my possession for two and a half years now i've
pollinated them with three different males in multiple different environments and the same
thing keeps happening if it's indoor if it's outdoor if it's under hps metal halide or led
no matter what i try to do to those two females i don't get any seed stock so in two years i've
made a total of under 100 seeds i haven't counted them but there's less than 100 seeds that i've
done on five different pollinations on these two different girls that i've selected from those
from that space cheese line and those two plants for me no matter what i do i cannot get them
to make large amounts of seeds and if i do it in open pollination if i do it with a hand selected
pollination no matter what i do those two girls will not accept pollen and it's not from just
their related brothers it's also from plants that they're 100 unrelated to so i believe in nature
that there is something like that happening but hey we just aren't looking for it and we can uh
solve this question for you if you've got strains that that you think might uh already uh be
triplet in this way be happy to take a sample over at our lab and and uh let you know definitively
oh i i understand that i'm just that's i'm it's not my interest really um i just it's just
something i've observed and i know other people have too that's why i brought it up earlier
i know that there are cultivars out there that will not produce seeds i don't know if they're
petrified or what ploy do they are but i believe that if a female isn't able to produce seed from
multiple males that she isn't related to then something is different with that girl i don't
know what it is i'm i don't have the education to find out i know there are other people out there
i just i just know that those plants exist yes mr mr toad if if you've been running that plant
two years right you've only got less than 100 seeds have you grown any of those seeds and
and tried to find females that will pollinate from it that would be close not yet and then removing
that plant because obviously if she doesn't work she doesn't work right i have not tried the
progeny yet to find that out um i i haven't released those seeds either because of the
fact that the mothers do not want to produce seeds i don't ever want to put something out
there and pretend like she's novel and try to take money from someone because that because i
don't understand why she isn't producing seeds i just know that she doesn't and it's not just
one plant it's two sister plants that i selected from my space cheese line that are doing this
and it did it on a third one when i used to grow her back in uh around 2012 when i started uh
into my breeding rooms and productions she's there's a reason why um i only released my angel
bat cross number two on such a small level and that was because that girl didn't she never wanted
to produce pollen but then that period i had only tried her with one male to date now i've tried that
line with five different males and i get the same result and it's always in different environments
because i never breed in one type of environment so i when i breed outside i'll do an early season
and a late season i've bred in a hoop house i've bred in greenhouses i've bred in indoor with like
i said mixed light single light sources um so i've tried to see what's happening with her
as close as i could without sequencing and finding out or running any kind of test lab testing i just
know that she doesn't produce seeds like any other plant that i've had in my possession
in the last 15 years at least um nothing else that i've had besides the mac one and the mac one
actually produced more seeds with the males that i introduced to it than my space cheese did and
that's the only reason i brought the mac one in is because i was told by so many people how it
doesn't like to produce seeds but i was able to produce seeds on that plant on a higher level
than on mine so and then there's a possibility that my females once released to someone else
don't have that issue so that's what i'm about to do next is to put my females into the hands
of people i trust and let them try to do whatever they can to pollinate her can i ask what you
selected that plant for i don't know anything about the genetics of that uh the space cheese
i selected them for the highest amount of that cheese flavor i wanted it to come as close to that
uk cheese mother from the blue cheese side then uh that i could find out of everything so that's
where she was selected through and then i started to use the selections for the back crosses like i
said to make my angel back cross number two was the second back cross i did to my angel male
i've done seven different back crosses to it over the years and multiple uh generations of
back crossing i've done six different back crosses to that original male through the space cheese
line but only because i found one when i did it that was able to produce seeds for me when i
started to go through in the back crossing and the progeny i didn't find it when i got into like the
back cross numbers three number four number five and number six but in that uh f1 generation
they just don't like making any type of seeds for me that's what i'm wondering if the plants
that are tetraploid now if we release them back into the wild do they will they die completely
will they revert will they somehow breathe with another one in the wild and now multiply this uh
allele frequency that's happening in that plant increase the odds of us finding more in a
population that somehow are going to paint what i'm looking at i don't know that that's why i ask
these questions and that's why i'm here to debate with you guys um i'm never right i just know i
don't want to be wrong as i've always been so that's why i asked this question is that what
chevro was talking about that plants the paper as the french woman foe that was saying then plants
naturally revert back to diploid is that what you're saying chubb
chev's not there sorry sorry to get back um so i know that that's something that's been found
by a number of different authors if you look into the literature i'm not sure i'm looking at it
right now i'm looking at this one article on irish potatoes and the the abstract says that
basically observe that triploids can change into diploid genome constitution when exposed to
artificial stress conditions and that fluctuations in ploiding level may be a key factor in the
adaptation process yeah so this is kind of i mean just broadly speaking this is kind of was kind of
my point about naturally occurring changes in the ploidy level and general messiness in biology is
you know i think all sorts of stuff like this is likely to happen at at different frequencies right
and that's really the key is these things all happen at different frequencies
you know in the normal crop especially if the if a change like this doesn't have like
evolutionary advantage it's going to kind of weed itself out over time
or sometimes it's even just biological you know advantage or mechanical advantage i guess
it would be a way to look at it so yeah all sorts of stuff can happen they can split differently
they can double they can you know split partially and uh yeah it's a whole soup going on in there
yeah and the um specifically with the minosi diosi um dynamics that's something that's been
demonstrated in the literature but it's specific to that and obviously this is a different set of
mechanisms and a different set of dynamics that you know as ryan mentioned and as dan just pointed
out like we we don't know the frequency of um polyploidism in natural occurring species or
in the species naturally um so that that remains to be seen but i do just typically
the species is understood as a diploid species and so being polyploid is uh is a unique and
somewhat anomalous um phenomena i have a question hi guys sorry i tried to join earlier but it's
hard mondays are hard um with the work story it's always late days um but nice to hear all your
voices and i just had a couple questions for like dan and ryan i guess unless there's other people
who have perceptions you know i i've um i've grown uh triploids and i am curious uh i saw a
lot of anomalies in the seeds actually was something that i observed and i keep trying to
i know somewhere on my photos i have some very you know there's subtle subtle differences and i've
you know grown kind of an inordinate amount of seeds so i have a pretty good idea of what normal
cannabis seedlings look like um i'm just curious um you know maybe to dan if there's some like you
know i have like a multi-part question because i've been kind of fascinated with this since the
tech came out a couple years ago with organ cbd and you know one of the one of the claims had
previously been like increased yields and then also um that there also can be an increase in
terpene levels and so i'm just curious if uh if you guys are seeing like those things and then
also there was a lot of hype and talk around that these plants were more efficient with uptake of
nutrients and so that you could potentially have to use less nutrients so even beyond just you know
them being seedless and then people being kind of um i mean i have a lot of feelings about it because
it is kind of like been a major issue in the agricultural businesses with people then becoming
dependent on seed breeders and not being able to create their own seeds um you know and i guess with
there's a lot of non-propagation agreements at this point but so i think my main questions would
be are you seeing any other abnormalities in the plants especially the seedlings um are you actually
seeing increased yields in terpene content and uh is there any proof to the claim around um
like the efficiency of the plants being superior great questions um the uh truth is that um we
don't have enough data to say concretely really on any of those issues yet um we are sort of
initial results i think show a pretty modest increase in um cannabinoid and terpene output
but we really need to collect more data points um to really see if that's a real a real thing and
and especially to understand if that's happening why it might be happening um which is uh part of
the reason why we're really focusing this year on commercial field trials of the um you know of what
we call the pistol guard lineup so we'll be able to answer those more completely before we go out
to a broader commercial market next year um and kind of the same with the efficiency stuff you
know there's all sorts of stuff we've seen other crops we we see stuff anecdotally um with the
pistol guard line internally um but we really need to collect more data before we can speak
with authority on on uh on what the differences are um from a phenotypic perspective um you know
obviously the the key advantage that we're highlighting here is is the sterility itself but
we look forward to learning a lot more about the um uh the other differences to the extent they exist
dan i really got to tell you man i really respect that you say that um in the cannabis industry we
don't hear a lot of that we hear a lot of claims and bragging and claims without any evidence to
back up reality and the fact that you say i don't know and we're doing that work really
ups ups your credibility in my mind so we've never interacted before but that's uh i'm really
happy to hear you say that ditto i'm with you ryan um yeah because i just feel like there's like a lot
of like this hyped up talk around triploids being like this super plant that's gonna like do all the
things and you know i'm like okay really so you're gonna have increased yield increased cannabinoids
it's not gonna be seeded it's gonna be more efficient with uptake of nutrients i'm like okay
wow that's quite the quite the like um super plant you got there and i just um when i saw that the
seedlings you know were struggling a little bit behind other um other cultivars then i kind of
got a little bit suspicious right i was like uh okay why don't you look quite as healthy then as
the other ones but i guess yeah go ahead ryan more efficient in nutrients uptake would make me think
that you'd need to fertilize more right like i was just more on the standpoint of like huh curious i
mean like i'm all for it because i've dealt so many times with like crazy like inept neighbors
even in greenhouses and had to like do like you know twenty thousand dollar retrofits of like
pollen screens so palms not they're in oregon so i've seen it all i mean it's just like it's crazy
town i've been seeded out like so many different times and that's why i was like okay well yeah i
kind of get it and then even just now we just did a big trial of all of these um you know hype
wrapper weed genetics and then at the end of the day like you breathe on some of the stuff
and it hermes so then you're like seeding out right it just i don't know i you know i'm a big
believer that we need to really hone in our breeding practices just in general um to get
some more stabilized stuff out there so i'm not opposed at all to triploids i just more am curious
you know like what the you know if this is all heading down kind of like the royalties and ip
channels at the end of the day which i'm not opposed to either but you know it's like it's
going to really change i mean it's all changing the way we do things the next five years it's
going to really change a lot of that anyway so i'm curious you know i think dan i'd be curious
you know i've heard um you know also you know we use like a lo pot machine i've used an elephant
machine for years and just you know i know that darker has kind of done um some stuff from people
i work with within the alapot game so it's just like a it's a scalability thing i think also it's
like if you have something like that you know it's gonna actually work for people it is it's
gonna become highly desirable because people don't want to mess around with um unstable genetics that
don't do what they're supposed to do so i'm very curious to see uh what the potential is you know
with the future here so i'm curious i have more questions i'll try to think about them yeah i'll
try to think about them but you know i guess one of my questions too is like um you know are you
you know are you able to just apply this technology to
how easy it is is it to apply the technology to different cultivars um good question uh
you know so in the last year and a half or so i think that's really we've been focusing on
learning how to do this how to do it better there's been definitely been some stumbling
blocks along the way but we're feeling pretty good um now about our our ability to do it um
we're already pretty rapidly increasing um how quickly and effectively we can do it um so you
know it's it's not a no-brainer but i think you know given given the work that we've done we're
we're now feeling that this is uh you know on a scale of one to ten in breeding difficulty this
is kind of becoming more of a two for us so i think you'll you know we'll be able to um especially
if um the uh interest and demand is is there and in the way that we hope and think it will be um
we'll be able to take this across uh you know a much broader offering in terms of genetics we're
already you know one of the things um kind of that's uh cultural for us almost is uh collaboration
we work with a number of different breeders in the space and stuff like that even though we do
some of our own so we're already talking to some of our breeding partners about um introducing
pistol guard bridles of of uh their you know of their genetics you know stuff that's in their
library so yeah it's something that we hope we'll be able to offer more broadly and ryan by the way
thank you for the compliment on on talking about this um uh you know kind of uh in an upfront way
one thing i think we've learned over the years is this is a long life is long right and um certainly
takes a long time to develop this crop we're much more interested in the long-term trajectory of the
crop and the long-term improvement of the crop than we are about any sort of um
i lost you guys you still there yeah there we go anyway i was just saying um you know we really see
this as just as as interested in it as we are as a technology we really i think more than that even
see it as a kind of a tool for us um in this journey to to just like continue to improve the
crop overall and and especially to improve the quality of seed in cannabis space
yeah well it's you understand that this is a long-term business it's not make a it's just
refreshing because you know in this industry there's so much quick claim make the money get
out or they're gone by the time they have to promise right and so anyway it's anyway i just
wanted to show your respect for that i do also like to hold people's feet to the fire too so
you know like um when when we talk about like even just selfing a crop i mean you're talking
about doing technology are you guys you're doing a treatment either to a clone or you're doing
treatment to seeds from that clone um and then that generates a triploid plant and you can either
disclose that or not but i'm just wondering what what your application is because there's
consequences to the way that the technology is done like you know i i always talk about like
you know why you i don't know you've heard me rant on it but i always rant on this strain thing
and the proper use of cultivar and variety strain is essentially a biological type that when you
reproduce it the type is reproduced in the offspring and that's either done clonally like
in viruses or bacteria but obviously when you have a plant that is mostly heterozygous which
all cannabis is and you try to to self that that plant as an individual the phenotype that describes
that plant doesn't often come back at least it doesn't come back in the vast majority of the
population and so when you talk about having a triploid version of a given cultivar and i use the
word cultivar specifically to mean a plant with known and described traits that those traits are
passed on when the plant is cloned but not when the plant is propagated from seed right because
again you have sexual recombination and you get gene shuffling and essentially the phenotype that
describes the type doesn't come back yeah so when you're talking about having like triploid versions
of a given cultivar i expect that you have plants with three sets of chromosomes that are
phenotypically the same or superior than the correct yes you're you're absolutely i think i
think i understand what you're getting at and i believe we're on the same page right like um
the the technique of of creating triploids um as far as i'm aware invariably um involves
recombination um so to the extent that we're creating triploid varietals of a or you know
triploid uh specimens i guess of a specific varietal um it would be because those varietals
are well enough stabilized that the that you know that the recombined um phenotype is you know
substantially the same or similar to the to the uh to the varietal that we're describing right and
our ability to do that will depend very much on on uh the the underlying varietals themselves
you know i i believe uh certainly the seed varietals that we're introducing to um to um
to our trial partners this year for example are because they are recombined would not be you know
we would not describe them as being uh you know uh pistol guard varietals of a known um of a known
varietal you know we would describe them as we would likely describe them as being you know like
a novel new varietal yeah because then that just comes into kind of like what everybody's been
trying to do with automatics by introducing a photo period and then naming that automatic after
the photo period and then that's where when i mentioned earlier can kind of mess everything up
when if a regular grower and i don't know if this is what's going to happen with what you guys are
producing but a regular home grower gets their hands on one of these clones somehow and then
introduces it to the community as the original this is where we end up having issues with
yeah it's an interesting totally it's it's it's an interesting concept i mean i'm i'm sort of like
i probably would be like considered uh maybe like a little bit outside of the zeitgeist on this but
you know from my perspective i think to ryan's point the the crop most of the crop all of it i
mean people are doing good work now to to stabilize uh lines and start to create a little bit more
uniformity in the seed and stuff like that but you know to a large extent it's still very
heterozygous so um you know we're we would be pretty careful with with how we look at it but
that said you know it's also not true that every that we would see every genotype as it has a
different varietal either right when when we think about varietals internally we think of them as
really being related to phenotypes you know once we even if something has distinct genotypes from
our perspective if phenotype is uh you know is in different indifferentiatable among among the
customer base then from our perspective it it is really the the same varietal and you know in the
future we would likely describe varietals in in that way can i just chip in i don't want to
cataract what you said varietal is varietal is an adjective okay so um when we say varietal it's
like you talk about like the wine from sauvignon blanc grape is a varietal wine but the grape is a
variety i did it earlier i did it earlier i said varietal i made a mistake i'm sorry ryan i'll
remember next time yeah no it's okay i will i will take that as a as a grammatical point and make sure
that change thank you i'm not trying to be a dick about it but it's like no that's fine i'm fine
yeah okay cool there's like a ton of inside jokes at this point around like that you know it's like
i think we're all kind of everybody's just like where i'm like let's just go back to plant you
guys know how i feel like they're all just plants some plants make seeds some plants don't so the
plants that don't make seeds i kind of have a question you know so i mean because i wasn't
very sure if you guys were going to be offering things and you know like a plantlet form or
clonal form or seed form or all of the above um and then also just like i know it was very
interesting what you said earlier and i want to back up what ryan said i feel like um you know
transparency in this industry at this point is like half the game because we've seen what goes
wrong when people are not transparent about what their practices are um and i think that it's very
interesting what you said is like we just don't have enough data yet and i really it's come so
clear to me that data is really what is gonna sell genetics in this next um you know this next
chunk within the next five years i think the more data that you can have to back things up and like
the more proof that what you have is really gonna prove what the market wants um is gonna make a
huge difference so i'd just be curious you know if if there's any variation also when you're um
you know because we just don't know what happens you know when you're are these things going to run
the same as like the more traditional genetics that we have um as far as with if you're like
within cloning i guess or tissue culture is there any variation or any differences that you guys
seen so far you mean just like production differences yeah like production differences
like are they as stable as like other things down the line you know yeah you know i mean like
again we're like pretty optimistic about it because uh especially because of some of the um
kind of like uh i don't know what we're gonna get some of the triplets that we found in the wild so
to speak or you know in the in the industry already um gives us a good sense that they're
going to perform pretty well um but you know we're i mean you know and we see all sorts of anecdotal
stuff but again we got to kind of you know expand those expand those trials out a little bit to make
sure that those are like sometimes these things are hard to pull apart you know what what what do
we see that's really you know more of a genetic interplay you know it just happens to be an
interesting uh variety in terms of how it's uh best cultivated and when does that have to do
specifically with the ploidy level that's you know we do need to do some more testing before we know
for sure cool thanks i'm so curious hey i got a question for you i got a question for you avion
you know we've talked about all these like non-traditional breeding strategies
um you know over the past whatever few months including CRISPR and you know genetic modifications
and a whole bunch of other stuff which are really like unnatural right obviously they're lab-based
as like you know i i feel like you're a pretty from the earth kind of
hippie mama values in terms of doing things like naturally hey brian well no i mean i don't i don't
mean that in a bad way like i mean that in a good way but what what like how do you feel about
something like triploids versus something like CRISPR and why and how do you draw the line
like i'm genuinely curious well i've been accused of having drunk the kool-aid at this point so
like that's kind of i mean yes at one point you know so my background is definitely like
regenerative organic biodynamic agriculture but also like i have had to learn a lot of things
about scale and like what that actually means and then where the crossover is and i think that
honestly it was very opposed for a long time to you know like i used to be opposed to patenting
plants but i'm also now not so it's just i think and same i think i think we've had those
discussions previously on like the difference between genetic modification and perchance like
genetic engineering or you know what we do i mean even like i you know one of my skill sets is like
feminized seed production at scale so you know it's like okay cool you have something you want
to do how do you want to scale that you know how can you make kilos of pollen and not just like a
little bit of pollen so i'm already um you know i've already kind of shifted um you know my
perceptions of what we need to do in order to provide you know the right genetics and um i'm
i'm i'm i think i'm on the science side now to be 100 honest i think that you know as much as i love
also the fact that i want to encourage people to breed with i remember we were discussing that we
need to start classifying the different styles of breeding because we have like these traditional
breeders that are like you know salt of the earth and i don't want to call people pollen checkers i
don't know if it's like derogatory at this point but we have people we have like different classes
like people who really care people who understand basic science and you and trevor have been trying
to bring that knowledge to the table over this past little chunk of time and i think that these
breeders round tables have really been doing that but i think that at this point we really need to
start to like differentiate you know or what exactly are you doing um because it's not all
it's not all created equally um and i'm not opposed at this point honestly my concerns with
CRISPR and things where you know if we're just gonna like knock out and make uh make genetics
that are non-detect THC that we could potentially be doing more damage i just don't want to do damage
to the plant population as a whole with like pests so when i want to look at the data you know i'm on
the board of the ethical data alliance for a reason because i want to see the data of these genetics i
want to see that we're not creating downstream problems by knocking out certain traits and
breeding for certain things that are just arbitrary as far as like you know with the
you know USDA farm bill rules that all of a sudden it's like it can't be above you know
0.3 total THC well what's the what's the what's going to be the issue you know 10 years from now
are we going to have like plants that are just so susceptible to pests so i think it's a fine line
and um i'm definitely not opposed um i am opposed to people uh trying to own a technology or own
part of ag i think we need to learn the lessons from traditional agriculture that have caused
damage and um learn from those lessons and not repeat them so it's a long answer and i don't
know how to answer that like in a short way it's a very it's an interesting answer i mean it's kind
of on the lines of what we were talking about what Trevor was mentioning earlier about you know
that these kind of were the opinions how people felt about STS and the use of STS to create you
know all female seed laws and feminized seeds or whatever you want to call them but um you know
and the community was really really really against that for like the longest period of time i remember
when Hyde brought out the exe started selling it on cannabis world or whatever it was at the time
or at least promoting it on there and this other like very well studied quite intelligent cannabis
breeder by the name of Vic High you know got right upset with Hyde and said you know what happens
when the world becomes addicted to your chemical and everybody's using STS or what they didn't know
it was STS at the time but you know what what happens when everybody can no longer make seeds
without your chemical because the whole world has gone to feminized seeds right and you know Hyde's
answer which was pretty funny but also very obvious it's like you you can keep like a handful
of feminized seeds you can store enough Y chromosomes to save the world if you wanted to
um right because they really aren't even don't have that much use and you can just open pollinate
them once every 20 years and put them in a freezer and you're not losing anything so
um it's interesting to hear you see yourself as a pariah that's already drinking the kool-aid
if your community feels that way veggie that is really fucking funny to me oh yeah i mean i've
been accused of like how can you even be friends with salt growers and i'm like dude i've like
i'm like we're all in this together at this point so you know i mean it just is a different i will
say that something very concerning to me you know with all of these things is when you're and i'm
not sure what dark heart is doing with the specific um you know when you are using products like STS
what's very concerning to me is that the majority of people don't know that it you know has like
very very strict disposal rules and i've spoken to breeders that had no clue you know and i'm like
you you you know especially when you're doing something at scale is like just responsible
um practices i think at this point and when you know it's basically i like to you know it's a
funny way to think about it but it's like you know in the world of like trauma work you know
it's like you don't want to create more trauma in the world and i think of breeding the same way
it's like you don't want to create problems i mean think about all the whack stuff we've seen over the
past few years with auto flower breeding you know and when they were like oh we just crispered out
the gene that was causing all the problems and in my head i was like oh thank god you know like
because yes i don't necessarily agree with it but you know it's like also all these universities and
you know people are using science at this point and we have to start looking at the science and
the data and um and i think the biggest concern is causing more issues than we know um you know
what we're doing we don't want to create plants that are going to be susceptible because we're
monocropping something now cannabis is now like a very fifth most valuable agricultural crop in
america still not federally legal but we are monocropping it and we have to look at the serious
consequences of of when we mess with the population so i'd just be curious you know i'm going to be
very curious i hope that dan you guys will share a lot of your um data open source um with the
community because i think that transparency and how we can all move forward um is half the battle
at this point you know and yes things can be proprietary and still shared i think as far as to
advance the you know just the science at this point you're here you're here just just say i mean
go ahead sorry go ahead so just a quick point um you know uh obviously we are and i know this is a
hard thing but you know it is important to us that we you know are able to um end up uh recovering
our costs for a lot of our research and so you know you will see us um you know finding ways to
monetize it for sure as we move forward um but we've also i think uh you know again we just try
to kind of continue that that spirit of collaboration and communication is one of the
reasons why we're really proud when our when our science team can kind of uh publish work and you
know it's kind of an ongoing uh ongoing part of our science work to continue to to publish
literature out there it's a good way for us to um share with the community what we've done to
you know be able to have others build on it and you know it's also a good way for us to kind of um
you know for you guys to be able to kind of uh trust but verify right yeah so that we're actually
yeah kind of back to ryan's point but uh we're not just blowing smoke right
yeah and i got it i mean i got to say just for the listeners and this isn't
against dan or dark art or anybody like this there are technologies of how to make triploids
published in the scientific literature for cannabis so this like technique is theoretically
doable to anybody and there's other groups that are already doing it as well um so um really the
ip is in how you guys do it differently but i don't think that there any is real real data to
hide i mean if i were developing a technology like that and commercializing it which is totally fair
for for dark heart to do that i wouldn't teach other people the successes that they had figured
out either right because they have the right to profit from from their their work like you said
they have to recoup the investment that's what when you do scientific research to improve something
the expectation is that there will be a reward for doing so like you don't just give away
your hard-earned discoveries to the competition right um but once you produce those plants like
say for example uh dan comes up with or works with someone who comes up with like a sherbert
that is identical to the you know the highest performing sherbert plant and smell taste flavor
and effect but it has three sets of chromosomes and all these other benefits that come along with
being a triploid right like he's not going to hide that information like that data of course he'll
say this is how the plant performs because like i think that that's the level of expectation of
the industry now i know when i go to sell genetics i get question on everything from like
yield per square meter and um or per square foot for the american folks or you know cannabinoid
content or terpene content but also like what's the return on fresh frozen wash yields right like
people that are buying genetics these days are getting pretty savvy in the legal markets
um thank freaking god sorry orion i just gotta say yeah well thank you look 10 years ago we
didn't even know like when i started work down in the states we did that massive market survey
i mean we were collecting data that really nobody had except for a couple of labs and
the labs weren't really organizing it in a way that they could really i think really see the the
full chemical sphere right of what was going on in the plant um so but yeah now we're you know
we're at the point where everybody here is really starting to understand these things and not only
like how important they are to growers but how important they are to smokers and processors and
everybody else in the supply chain that uses those numbers to sell the products so like if you're a
genetic supplier these days you're gonna have all that info um it's not enough to just say yo i got
these ecs they're dank right um it probably is enough to sell into a large part of the market
but i think the legal market is getting to demand like a much higher level of like yo you want to
sell something we want to have the data on what it is right well yeah and i want to see like you
know i think at this point i it's not enough for somebody to just tell me oh yeah it's fire we ran
it four rounds we just came from this breeder you know i'm like okay well am i gonna like breathe
on it and is it gonna hurt me when i do that you know like is it is it stable what does the flower
look like i mean and the funny thing because even today when i saw that where i saw the dark part
announcement in my head the very first thing i thought was like well as long as it's purple and
gassy or whatever as long as they can make it whatever the market wants because at this point
it does nothing matters unless it's what the market wants to be 100 percent honest read all
day long it's a sad story honestly i think it's just it's like every if it's not wrapper weed
nobody wants it right now so it's just it is what it is yeah same in canada there's like there's
very few scent profiles that actually sell and it's kind of like the snake eating his tail like
i feel like the market needs to be told what it wants from someone oh my gosh a huge amount of
diversity that exists in the species like when i go into a well i never go into a shop so what am
i saying but when people show me commercial weed they've purchased i'm most often disappointed by
the scent or the limited sense you know just having seen this massive chemical variety that
can exist in the species to have to be limited to the small selection of what the market tells us
should be grown it's like it fucking mind boggles me it really does well that's kind of why i went
that was my first question to dan also and i'm sure other people maybe have questions as well
but it's like if it's true you know and that's why i'm we're very excited to see the data on this
because if it is true that it potentially there is a potential to increase yield or there is a
potential to with you know increased um cannabinoid or uh terpene content with the triploids then um
awesome you know so that that if you guys can prove the data there and it would be interesting
i i don't know how exactly it's going to be a lot of data collection to show especially if you're
working with um converting lines over um i would just be very interested to see you know kind of
where that heads because that's half the battle right and yes i i want to say i too agree with you
ryan that um i i was joking today that it's just such a narrow tunnel right now with what the
market is wanting um that it's a little it's a little bit sad to me honestly because i think
cannabis has such an incredible diversity to offer but we're kind of just stuck in this little teeny
narrow tunnel of what's hypey and popular and i would love to educate consumers because i feel
like ultimately they're really the ones that are missing out um yeah interesting
well guys it's been really fun uh chatting with you tonight unfortunately i've got to uh
i've got a hungry family i have to head off to but um yeah i've enjoyed it um thanks for
letting me be part of it appreciate the conversation yeah nice meeting you and thank you for sharing
dude yeah thanks dan i appreciate it i'm gonna take off too i gotta go too i posted a little
clip from evian on instagram though i thought it was really poignant about the downstream effect so
all right peace guys not about my not about my drinking the kool-aid thanks russell
all right love you guys bye
danny um oh he's gone i just wanted to congratulate them because it is a cool thing
you know to that they've done and i just want to say that too you know anytime i think innovation
is half the battle too creating a solution to an issue in the industry is how we move forward
and i think not enough breeders are actually trying to create solutions to problems they're
just trying to get stuff out and that's i think how we end up with so many unstable genetics on the market
yeah i mean i think it's cool i you know i don't say this to take away from dark
they've done there is a published method for doing this online so anybody that wants to
you know spend the the the care and energy to do yeah i posted it on youtube can do it
i'll post up the the article trevin as trevor already hasn't posted it in the uh
in the chat but canopy growth corp the company that was tweed that you know martha stuart and
uh snoop dog they all partnered up with that big corporation for those people that
don't know them they put some money into this and they're actually the ones that funded the
study that was published at a carlton university and um so and oregon cbd has also done this you
know some other time so so they're not the first to do it um i you know i i wonder like at a certain
point in time you know a lot of people probably don't remember back this far but when feminized
seeds were first introduced you know bringing up what trevor had mentioned before is how is this
different for feminized seeds when femme seeds were first introduced it was only a couple of
companies that were doing it and then eventually the entire market really shifted over towards
feminized seeds especially in europe it might not be the same degree in in california but i think
it's also happening in the states as well to the vast majority of seeds that are sold globally i
think would be fair to say that they're feminized and 15 years ago that wasn't even the case right
20 years ago it certainly wasn't the case so you know i wonder if does cannabis move into like an
entirely triploid state i think that all these triploid producers have to show the merits right
like that data needs to be disclosed we need to really understand like are these plants better
um dave rob did this work a long time ago i think it was in the in the 90s and they didn't find
benefit to polyploid during their at least in their for the projects that they were undertaking
they didn't find that there was a benefit um that doesn't mean that there isn't one but they just
for the goals that they were going after it didn't happen so you know that might also be the case that
this goes nowhere right so it'll be it'll be interesting to see what happens right you know
how hard was it to get into figuring out how to make them and i see it's like once people switched
over their mindset a lot of people figured it out pretty quickly and i think baud lair was actually
the first person to even post that sts thing online for the mohan ram paper um so you know
it's not very hard to get those chemicals but it's really not that much harder to do um
polyploid breeding especially if you have access to a flow cytometer so i'm sure like even if it
becomes popular maybe some lab in california sets one up and does flow cytometry as a service so
that you can you know make your polyploids at home and then send your samples into the lab to see
which plants are actually polyploid i was wondering about the accessibility ryan so that's uh you know
because a lot of the time it's just um a matter of accessibility to the right equipment and i feel
like even just in the past few years there's still people that were not fully converted over to um
you know or just really hard against feminized but i do see and i mean i feel like there were
moments a few years back where i just didn't fully feel like it was 100 necessary and my biggest
concern with it is that people are really feminizing a lot of seeds and then not properly
dealing with the um toxic waste that comes off of the sts you know i think that needs to be more
widely discussed in the community like proper disposable proper disposal disposal techniques
um and um not just something that is is not discussed and i think it's really on the sts
companies that are like selling um also and just anybody that's selling things that are
feminizing generally it's not a very um organic practice so to speak so um i'm just i'm yeah i'm
very curious i mean how much do those machines cost ryan do you know just off the top of your head
yeah i think they're in the like 40 to 60 000 range there might even be a little bit more than
that um you made a good point on the safety of sts but not not only from like a safety perspective
but also a health perspective you've mentioned before health safety um i feel i should really
say that about colchicine or the chemicals that are used to induce polyploids in in plant cells
are like highly mutagenic you definitely should not be messing around with those chemicals if you
don't know how to use them um and have proper disposal and like you know even like flow hoods
and proper ventilation you you don't want to be breathing that stuff in and you definitely don't
want to be getting it on your skin um so yeah just to say that it's not do it is doable by people but
you really have to know how to handle the chemicals or should inform yourself on how to
handle the chemicals i missed it i'm sorry go ahead todd oh i was just going to say with the
uh sts disposal the folks out there if you need to dispose of it you should be disposing of it
at hazardous waste at your city landfill in a proper type of bottle not just down your drain
it's not something that you need to be letting get into the water system you're correct on that
100 it's definitely not something you want to be heading back into your local watershed too
so it's not the type of thing you can just chuck buckets out of on your land or something along
those lines so just uh probably a maybe a good discussion to have in one of these rooms on like
best practices of you know how and even just responsibility with pollen also because i know
a lot of people that um only breed off season because they want to be good neighbors and i
think that's a really um you know that's a nice thing because you know i have a whole presentation
on pollen actually thought about you anthony just and maybe that we need to have like a kind of tag
team do a little bit more of you know presentation on just what exactly you know how you deal with
pollen and how you work with it and and how we are responsible stewards of pollen and um
you know just it's such a fun science and there's just not it's not like a super widely um shared
on the pollen side of it and proper storage and all those things so it would be fun that's
something i'm about to do
and three weeks here i'll start it that way there will be no live plants or anybody else around me
not that i have any but if anyone was close to me that would be one reason why people would be
doing something just like that you mentioned that i was also wondering if maybe earlier when i missed
the beginning of the room if there was a discussion around you know like where the
triploids are the most useful because it's you know i just unless it unless they can prove the
data on it having um you know increased yield or increased any of the benefits beyond just the fact
that they're seedless which seems to be more what they're focused on um but it's like that's great
for outdoor production especially for areas where there's um where you know there's like
ditch weed or other things but uh for indoor product i mean maybe for greenhouse as well but
for indoor production i just am kind of on the fence about like if it's even i don't know i'd
be just be curious your other you're all of your perceptions on um like application of where this
is actually going to hold value in the industry because and also like the ip piece is kind of
fascinating to me as well like what exists mainly just so people can actually start collecting
royalties and that people that's also part of my why i was asking the cloning question i'm like do
these things properly clone are they gonna you know is this gonna make it so people are gonna
have very strict non-propagation rules in the future um i'm just i mean i know a lot of people
already do so it's kind of interesting i think beyond all of those things are going to become
royalty based or ip based in some form like look if if you spend a year or two say two years
creating a plant and the thousands of dollars in analytical costs like say that whole cost
like is like 100 100 000 150 000 you can't give that plant away without restrictions for like
for one guy to grow for a thousand bucks like it doesn't make sense to do that right
and so if farmers want to benefit from the next generation plants that are truly superior to what
the average of what's on the market today you're gonna have to enter into some time like those
plants aren't just come across like that's what produces the average that we got today like the
next generation plants that are going to be bred using science for optimizing chemical profiles
and resistances and all that kind of shit they're going to be royalty based it has to be there or
there has to be some kind of financial relationship between the guy that made the plant and the guy
that wants to grow it for a profit right like it's that's the way that it works in all other
forms of agriculture from seed supply to flower breeders to everything like it has to be profitable
for those people to stand in in business right like they have to at least break even so i think
that that is going to be the norm in the future buying the idea that you get to buy seeds for 250
bucks and have it like an unlimited cloning rights and everything to do those things those days are
like they kind of exist in the online cannabis community but i don't think that that exists
in the actual licensed business community right because there's all there's all these costs there's
all these added cost of like compliance to regulations and maintaining a facility and all
that kind of shit like it's not as cheap as growing up on the hill right um so i think
everything's going that way that's just my own opinion i feel the same way that that's where
we're headed for sure i mean how do you feel about that anthony and i just be curious like i mean
every we all have these conversations and i just think that um you know i'm i use same thing i used
to kind of be more opposed to you know like well how can anybody own a plant you know and then and
now i've really come around to realize that um it is the future and it also i i see triploid as a way
for people to protect their lines and i definitely feel like there could be
um a dash in that direction because because it's pretty much the only way to um you know especially
with the i don't know it just is a very interesting conversation like royalties ip and the more that
we're starting to spread across the more legalization happens i think that it's the future and so i think
i've come a long way from used to being opposed to plant patents now really understanding and i kind
of see that triploids are definitely it's it's kind of like it's just another it's a fast step
more commercial can i ask the group what they thought about that pilot patent on the propyl
cannabinoid plant um because it's just kind of fun to me it's so funny because of where that
whole started story started with the great pop monopoly and and mildly instigating that whole
fucking thing and then it comes up they're essentially doing the same thing right and
they're trying to that's why we busted their balls right because they were doing exactly
that kind of shit but right in front of our faces and pretending like we were too fucking dumb to
understand it right that's why we jump on some people like we do that come into this community
that we call it and treat them the way we do when they they treat us like we're the bastard stepchild
that's just out here sucking on roaches then that's what they get back we we give right to
them what they were trying to give to us they were lying to our face directly a lot of us saw that
and tried to explain that to our friends but our friends were starting to drink the kool-aid of
they knew what was coming i'm going to prop it off my plan i need to protect it so they were trying
to figure out a way to do that and they only found one option which became phylos and now we end up
with the whole bullshit of them becoming exactly who they said they were just in fine print because
if you read all the fine print everything they said they weren't going to do in public was being
laid out in private to be done and that's why a lot of us don't trust any of these places that
want to do this kind of stuff because we do know even if they don't have bad intentions at all that
it's for profit that's what these things are no one's setting up a lab to give away their work
for free and i don't expect anyone to do that i'm not one of those guys that believes just because
the cannabis plant can do this that you should give me this information for free to prove to
people that it's doing it i should put in that fucking work and i'm one of the guys that tried
to do it through as much hands-on as possible over the years i could have sped that up by just
sequencing and going into a lab that's 100 true it's just not my style of growing and breeding
because of the way i came to this plant so i can't put on me on anyone else what i believe
i can only offer that experience to others and hopefully see they that they'll see that
that point of view so that's what we try to do with phylos and i feel the same way i think you
did with it that is it's a laughable the way they tried to say they weren't one way and in the end
you got the guy that started the whole thing becoming that exact thing he said he was
uh i think it was pretty funny that nishan was on here earlier when we started out
uh it's anymore i did notice that that's why i brought him on that day when i saw who he was i'm
like i'm this cat's coming on he can't just lurk around and see what the fuck we're talking about
you need to come in here and treat us with the same respect that we treat this plant
yeah so that was that was amusing and it was all the more amusing um to see him he he came on
that day when we were all on here a couple months ago and he said he was going to come
back with some answers so i was i was kind of hoping that he may come up and answer some of
the questions we posed to him um but i also thought it was amusing that he he popped in here
a couple days after you posted that uh that patent or patent um
submission whatever however application that's been granted yeah i mean sorry i feel i feel two
ways about it like like part of me doesn't really i did i didn't i didn't post that up but i didn't
mention it to talk about nishan i don't care about the personalities i'm just more interested in the
business side like for the record i know both he and mowgli they offered me a job after i left
napro um and i declined for for a whole series of reasons but um i do know them and i'm i'm really
disappointed in in the way that this whole thing has played out with them because again like
nisha nishan i listened to that appearance on the show and some of the things that he said just
didn't jive like to blame it all on mowgli is like just like he probably was some rogue actor
that's nonsense that's absolutely fucking nonsense um so i you know personalities aside
directly related to the patent like i don't understand why you would file on such an obvious
non-novel plant and expect the u.s patent office to grant that the thing i haven't posted that i
was i intended to post after that post is that patent has actually already been rejected right
so the us pto said no i ain't gonna fuck or fly um and you know if you know anything about the space
about the cannabis space like i don't actually know how their patent lawyer even let them file
that because it's like he must have just been happy to take their money right because it's like
what they tried to patent so clearly wasn't novel it wasn't going to ever get granted and so the
question is why did he spend all that money in the fees preparing the patent application
and taking the time to do that right um so that's really what i was asking i was that was my
question yeah i was gonna totally go there too because i i was very i was like like
i mean if somebody actually has something novel unicorn unique and they've come up with some
magical thing that nobody else has but i think these like broad sweeping patents like that are
just kind of like it's like a it's just it's like an insult to the industry as like in such a i mean
there were some other ones where it's like oh like i remember there was that other patent i can't
remember the name of it but it was like the myrcene dominant type twos or something i'm like
okay well you can't have those those belong to the people so you know i just i feel like
there's a fine line between overstepping and it's it's insulting when you see things like that in
my personal opinion because it's like there are certain things that sure you could put try to
put a patent of it truly is unique and novel wonderful move forward with what you're doing
and try to protect your work and i'm sure you put lots of money into it but
broad sweeping patents like that that's what i've always been highly opposed to like you can't own
you know limonene dominant type two or type you know just it's like it's just insult to injury
to be for my honest opinion and also i will say that you know i think that there is this like
movement to like differentiate phyllos from conception but they really are the same thing
and i i hear people say that pretty frequently like oh well it's like two different things i'm
like i don't think it is two different things i think it is always been one thing and will
continue to be so um you know just uh i would say say no to broad sweeping plant patents
and for context i only um skimmed the post that you made brian but it it looked like the
claims they were making were specific to essentially any percentage of um different barren
chemobars so to speak yeah fractions yeah that's typically a patent strategy i don't know if it's
a patent strategy i don't know why it is like that but like you know like i've seen patents
on like gene sequence or whatever and they'll say like you know we patent this gene sequence
and any gene sequence that is like you know from say nine to ninety five percent or sorry five to
ninety five or ninety nine percent genetically identical including ninety eight percent and
ninety six percent and then they list them all out in the patent like every number between 99 and
five right and and it's just for like absolute clarity that they are claiming every single
possible combination of a patent and that's typically how patents are written is that
you you try to claim as much space as you can um but you have to show a little bit of evidence as
to why that those things are are the case right but the thing that i just found so weird is that
like these plants had existed on the market in the pub like that's what's called the public domain
right so anything that anybody can go out and buy is something we've never really talked about
on this show but you know i see it even in the comments on like you know instagram posts and
stuff like people are saying oh you know how they're going to come in and steal our stuff
and then like the next minute you see them selling those seeds on the market look if you sell seeds
on the market you lose the ip rights to that okay like so one of the one of the things for getting a
patent usually as it says like the you have to file within like if you put something on the market
you still have an opportunity to file but you have to file within a year of that thing being on the
market the safe strategy is you don't put it on the market until you've got the patent right and
so they're those are kind of like different ends of the spectrum of like how conservative you are
in protecting your ip but like if you're serious about protecting your ip you file on plants that
you've never sold the seeds of right because if you have sold the seeds of them what you've done
is put those things into the public domain you've taken an exchange of value for something that
you're giving out into the world right and especially if you don't have you know non-proliferation
contracts or non-propagation contracts like we were talking about before those people can go and
do what they want and it's free game right but if you've implemented all those things and you've
every time you've released the ip to a third party or a licensee they sign a contract that says these
are the conditions under which i will use it i won't take clones you know i assume responsibility
of an employee like takes a cutting and steals it out of the facility like all that kind of stuff
right and that's all about protecting the invention that you've got right like that's just
standard practice for business so anyway if just the bottom line is if you're selling seeds you
don't you can't patent them like you can't to think that you ought to sell something and think
that you still own it is kind of like a crazy idea so it's just and that's the way the law works
for some reason the cannabis community kind of thinks about it differently for some reason again
but you know like we say with like the plant breeder's right system like i think it's more
realistic like that the cannabis community starts to understand that these are the laws of business
and like you can't expect special treatment when you want to operate in a way that's not standard
business right because cannabis is legal now so like it's just part of the real world
i was wondering if i love all of that i mean i've been following a lot of that closely and
i work with people who knows what they do and now we've all been trying for the past couple years to
also like take it another level you know where maybe it's not going to be um you know necessarily
plant patents but that we have some we're utilizing technology because we just all have to agree that
the cts systems that are currently in place are like inept for actually the tracking of genetics
or seeds or other things but i really think that you know we're getting there and i think we talked
a little bit about the pilot that we're doing with the blockchain technology with the ethical data
alliance and canopy right and medicinal genomics and there's like other people and from the nursery
and the breeder like all the way through to the end consumer and i think that they're you know
maybe we can start to see at least how things move through the supply chain in a different way
but i think the people that have been missing out of that this whole time with the cts systems is
the breeders and it's just a different way to start to um you know with royalties and other
things i think there's going to be some very interesting pieces with technology that come
through to help us um help guide the ship a little bit and make it easier for people
and i thought about this um you know because we think about cannabis and it's like you know
obviously we're talking more about um you know type one and type two but it's like really the
breeding is the same with hemp and type three and i thought maybe it would be a good idea to have
some of the people on from like the seed certification from hemp because they've
really been doing a lot of footwork with that to try to get you know this cultural crop how are we
going to how is regulated and type one plants you know going to tie in with that in the next
a couple years and i think they've already been doing the work so maybe there's a way that we
can have like a deeper conversation about where this is all going sometime soon and bring on some
more experts on like the upav and the ayahuasca certifications and those sort of things so we
could have you know just maybe some of the ip lawyers and other things too to have a little
bit more a deeper conversation of how the breeders can protect their work because everything you're
saying ryan is 100 accurate yeah i mean the i i'd have to ask peter if this was true and he
could look because he has access to the youtube analytics i would probably guess that the majority
audience in of the of the clubhouse and the youtube certainly is probably american so i think
the most the best person to have is a good as an easy start would probably be dale hunt
the american system is a little bit different than the system that kind of the rest of the world
uses it's based on it but obviously you know americans do things americans let america way so
um you guys have the actual patenting of plants which we don't have certainly in canada but most
of the world also doesn't do that they use they use like a upav based system so
dale would probably be a good a good person i was thinking of dale i mean i definitely
obviously like that's what i'm thinking of when i'm amy he's like the preeminent plant patent
lawyer in the united states so it would make sense i mean there's a few other people he's the
preeminent he's the preeminent cannabis plant patent lawyer yeah yeah he's definitely not the
preeminent plant yes no totally but he came from the traditional ag world too so with that
patenting other um plant varietals and different things but i i think it's more also about how that
because where i see that it's like something that we have failed to do in the industry is
future-proofing the industry and it is the future cannabis project after all so like i think that
you know how do we bring can totally agree ryan because i also see you know there's a lot of other
canadian and dutch company it's like other places and other countries in the world have a leg up and
they're already been moving genetics all over the globe and so we're kind of at a deficit i think and
it's like how do we future-proof what we're doing and then also make sure it doesn't um
you know because as we can see with hemp you know they just really kind of um i've never used the
term in my life but like screwed the pooch i guess i'm gonna say it's like they screwed it up for us
with with a lot of different things and i think that we have to just be very very careful
the more legalization comes online like how and because it's an agricultural crop like how
we protect ourselves and protect the breeders and protect the cultivators um by future-proofing
our work so that we can say hey you know you can't really do it like this you got to do it like this
or you know so maybe having somebody from america but i would also think somebody from canada and
maybe somebody that's also um maybe we could even bring in some of the more um the european
flavors but having more like a global discussion around where it's all heading and how we can do
the work to future-proof it that would be what i'd like to see happen yeah i'd support that i think
it'd be very cool to bring people on like dale and um there are certainly some experts out there
in the world who know the upav system and cannabis and it'd be super super interesting
to hear them uh come on uh them being david watson or any number of other people there's also
i think was it james calloway or callahan jace jace calloway jace he is that phenol you're talking
about phenola yeah yeah yeah yeah he's only got one registration i i believe but he does have
um an interesting experience with you bob including have a variety having had a variety
deregistered right he had a variety that he that he had registered and then it lost the certification
but i think he got it back um so he is definitely i wouldn't know if he was an expert but he's
definitely an interesting guy um i i've invited david to come on the truth is dude he doesn't
have a cell phone so there's no way that he like he won't be having the app next time i go over
there he may he may decide to come on and he'd be an interesting guy um to talk to you about it
because he has some experience and you know dave's just actually a totally interesting character so
he's got a lot to say about cannabis um and a fair amount of money i'm sorry i said maybe we
can get him on the future canvas yeah i'm sorry again you were breaking up i couldn't understand
what you said i think he said maybe we could get him on a video on one of the youtubes perhaps
yeah he's yeah i mean you're definitely not going to get him on on a camera that's for sure yeah
but like like i said when i go next time i go over there i think that's probably the most likely time
that it would like if it was going to happen that's when it would happen um
i i've had some talks with you paul the the folks involved with you paul directly um with actually
with david but he and i went together i was working for a company out in the states and
they did a bunch of ip work that's been mentioned on the show tonight and anyway after i left that
company i wanted to really get an understanding of what my rights were and what i could and couldn't
do um in terms of registrations or just future work or whatever and so when i was over with david
he and i went and saw one of the lawyers that's associated with you pause and had a big conversation
with him about how the system is inadequate for cannabis because okay to step back like typically
when plants were registered they were registered based on based on physical characteristics that
could be described so you know think dutch tulip praise if you had like a year's worth of cannabis
if you had like a yellow tulip tulip with like a lightning bolt black stripe in in the petal
and that was like reproducible that's like a visual characteristic of the plant that shows
that it's unique that was enough to get a plant variety registration and so when they developed
the plant breeding the plant registration system it was really based on plant morphology how big
is the carrot what does the fruit look like you know so for example like you can actually get a
plant registration on a rose based on its color but not its scent right and so they don't really
consider chemical characteristics for plants you can submit them when you're making your application
process process but it's not like the the person that evaluates your application doesn't actually
have to consider either chemical i.e. scent cannabinoid content flavor or any of that stuff
or genetic data right those are considered supplemental to the application which is kind
of bizarre but that's the way that the system works and so when they enter cannabis into the
you know as they go through like registering plants they're like okay we're going to start
registering cannabis varieties well all the varieties that were being submitted were hemp
right so it was like it was stuff like what's the thickness of the stem what's the width of
the stem what's the inner node ratio how big are the seeds you know and they they give ranges of
how big the seeds are what color are the seeds right what's the habit anyway everything that's
described is a physical characteristic of the plant not a chemical one and that was essentially
what David and I went and said to these people and said look the system you have for classifying
cannabis is insufficient for you know medicinal cannabis or recreational drug cannabis
and so yeah it was an interesting conversation so yeah I've seen that I mean it's a super I mean
it's a whole the whole thing to me is an interesting conversation because like you know I
think that Russell recently posted something with the Cannabis Horticultural Association
you know just talking about wanting to do some sort of germination trial with other breeders
and you know if you think about even you go to the store and you buy a pack of pea seeds that
they're gonna have you know a germination rate and other things and you're gonna have like a proof or
certification and I do know because I'm one of the people I've worked with very closely one of the
business partners the past four years five years six years long time is has a seat on the Oregon
hemp seed certification board and so there's been just a ton of conversation about the ayahuasca
and you know as far as what Oregon looks for for variety ownership declaration and things like that
and you know and there's like experimental stuff and and basically and germination and and all of
those different things and so I think I guess what I was trying to point to before is you know
my concern if we're not careful is that you know as things open up and become more I'd be curious
Ryan actually the perspective in Canada and and how they deal with a lot of the genetic stuff there
because I guess my concern as an agricultural crop is that we just don't want it to get weird
and what their requirements are or how you know because right now it's kind of been like you know
it's been the wild west for so long um within the cannabis industry and within the genetic space and
nobody can tell you you know like I've how many breeders I've talked to I'm like what's the
germ rate like oh it's good I'm like what's good you know like what does that mean exactly like
is it like traditional ag where it's like over you know 80 to 85 percent or is it like just is it
good so um I think it's just it would be interesting to kind of maybe do a little bit
deeper of a dive into um you know just like the basically like what the requirements are looking
like with hemp because I kind of foresee that it would maybe start to go in a similar direction
and yeah I'm just I'm interested in all of it from the royalties perspective all the way down to
you know how Ryan how is it in Canada because you guys can you can sell can you sell
uh genetics internationally from from Canada because I know that people do
so there's in in Canada think about like are you're you know the California law like imagine
imagine 215 and 64 were concurrent okay so you had like a patient system and like a legal
system that's kind of what we have in Canada like so if you're a patient you can get a license from
the government to grow your own weed and you get like you know up to like 200 500 plants in some
cases or even more and people set up warehouses and grow dope and they sell dope and they sell
seeds small world that shit is totally illegal like if you have a patient license it's for the
person on the license to self-produce there's no commercial rights that come along with that at all
okay but if you're not regulating it how do you know right like so obviously people still do all
that stuff and people run very successful businesses to the point that like Canada can't
really stamp out the black market because this other system is going and they can't shut it down
because the courts have said that people have the right to grow their own weed right the other side
of the system is the legal system and those people in the legal system are like a closed loop they
can't interact with the medical system or the the home patient grow system but they have the rights
to do business with people offshore and you can get export licenses and all that sort of shit so
in fact like there's there's companies that are sending clones down to the states even now right
like in the states the DEA is starting to issue license for cannabis production and those companies
can do business with international companies right they can't sell to patients but they can do r&d
and all that kind of stuff it's really to be developed for like it's like a pipeline for the
it's like a pipeline for the pharma industry i think is probably what it's going to be
um so yeah like that's kind of the way it is if you get licensed to be in the legal system
like the commercial system they allow what's called a one-time declaration or a section 10
declaration and essentially you just have to tell the government what you got when you're bringing
it in and and you know i don't know if california was the same way at one point in time
i think it was but also um washington was definitely that way and a couple other
states have been that way too there's like an amnesty period essentially that's given to
companies to bring in genetics and then after that period they're supposed to be closed loop
right so during that time like people do sell into the system but technically you're not supposed to
because the people the patients aren't really licensed to sell right it happens though
did that answer your question i don't know sorry
it's never simple right it's like so yes that answers my question but you know i have heard
some of these larger um you know it's like if you look at europe you know and i don't i don't
want to like i hate naming companies especially if they're companies that i don't um necessarily
want to send people towards you know where i'm like oh don't do the thing that they do because
it's just like a certain you know i think it just kind of if too many people go towards uh one
genetics company or one thing i think it kind of washes out the system so i think but if you look
there's kind of like i don't want to call it monopolies it just kind of seems like there's
like the go-tos in certain areas and it just kind of becomes like a white bread flavor across the
the market and i think that that's kind of what we're experiencing right now um in uh in the
markets on the west coast honestly i i see that um it's like too many of the same kind of thing
um so yeah i mean i i see i think that i think hemp is great training wheels and i've done this
before and i think excuse me ryan but it's like i think it's true i mean we need to look at it
and i think trevor you've pointed to that too is that you know we need to look towards the future
of where it's all going especially if like the breeders really care about protecting their rights
um and if they really have unique things and i think that uh plants that are classified under
hemp or type three plants or you know just even fiber plants and you know all these minor
cannabinoids that kind of can fall under the hemp category if they have the right percentage of um
total cheap seed that those can be actually um international you can work internationally
with those things and so you know it's like i have people call me from austria asking me to
source things and random other countries and so it's like you have to start to learn those global
rules and i think my hope is that in the next you know five-ish years that we'll be having that
conversation with cannabis so i think that's kind of where i was going with the like we do need to
do some work around the future proofing of what we're doing because and we have the ability to
do that right now with um with hemp um and how we you know because seeds have to be cleaned a certain
way feed and if people are very serious about breeding and sharing genetics i think that we
all really need to get very clear on you know best practices and that goes from nursery to
seed it's all you know it's all it's all one way or another propagation and so i think that
i'd like to have that deeper conversation and bring in some of the experts around those topics
because um i am just a novice i don't know
yeah i've done a fair amount of international shipping through like legal channels now
and um had some interesting experiences and i've learned the hard way that there's like a lot you
know you're talking about seed testing there's a totally like you know i had to send some seeds
once to israel and we couldn't do it because the specific seed lot that we were sending
hadn't been tested for specific pests listed on the import document or you get what's called a
phytosanitary certificate and so you have to phytosanitary certify that the the pests that
the seeds are free from you know x y and z and in some cases the only way to do that is to have the
plants tested right like it's not enough to analyze the seeds you actually have to have the mother
plants those seeds came from tested and because we couldn't show that one aspect of the test the
seeds had already been made by that point in time we couldn't sell in this one seed lot to israel
right it was crazy but um yeah it's there are there are rules and uh to be truly mobile and
to sell into any market like you have to tick a lot of boxes that i don't think people even know
exist right yeah and i will say that you know when you're selling seeds or working with seeds
on a larger scale it's like people are starting to want those things over the past few years i've
seen people you know uh i think like somebody said earlier you know that the market is getting smarter
um thank god and i think i think you said that ryan and um i it's a lot you know to make sure
that um you're actually hitting all the boxes and being compliant and doing all the things so i think
that you know the the tide has turned and it it really we are an agricultural crop and i think
that we need to start to you know really view it as such and and recognize that we're going to be
also uh accountable in the same way that other agricultural crops are um and i think that
we're you know still miles to go but we're getting closer so it's very cool um i know trevor trevor do
you have some opinions because i know that you were like really looking deeper into um a bunch
of those things you know for a second there um i i'm yeah like um i'm really burnt out i
i went up to the regen conference this weekend up in humble and i car uh
carpooled with bam so i went down to santa cruz up to humble and back down so i'm all scattered and
you know sleepy but uh drugs are bad drugs are bad
but uh you're making me feel better that i didn't go honestly because i actually played
down on my ticket and felt like really bad but i just couldn't because i had too many things
going on up here and i felt terrible because i kind of had to cancel at the last minute but
you're making me feel better because i'm like i don't know if i could handle this week if i
was feeling like like that feeling um and i knew that would be the feeling it would just be like a
lot yeah no i i made it super extra by um uh try driving over two-thirds of california in 36 hours
twice but um it was great it was a lot of fun um but we can talk about that in another day um
no no talk about it i want to hear what the highlights were what would you please tell me
at least you learned something because i was like if i go there i'm like i really really really
really want to learn some things these are the sacrifices that you have to put in to get the
red butt restaurants are watching over social media johnson so yeah no it um i will say it was
it was really nice because i got to see some people i hadn't seen in a long time um
mr bob hemphill was there that was really one of the highlights if not the highlight for
bam and myself were were close friends with bob and uh we were just standing there kind of off on
the outskirts adam who was on here earlier was there with us and um we didn't even recognize
we didn't even recognize him he was super incognito had some sunglasses on a hat
walked up got up on us and was like hey buddies and he's been doing some incredible work with
these um it's a pacific northwest hash plant and the puck which are all basically in the same
realm and so they're all old 80s neville hash plant releases and it's um or breeding stock
that he worked with initially some of the clones but um the work that he's done with those plants
and the crosses he's made with other old hash plant varieties or cultivars is really really
really incredible in particular the red lab uh bamboo had an old red lebanese that's just a
beautiful nice purple red stems purple plant um it's a great plant on its own and the cross with
the the puck back cross was it it turned so many heads um jackson was there bam eric um lighthouse
or greenhouse light depth um whatever his ig is you guys know eric eric um but yeah we uh
we all puffed on that and immediately just gravitated to the red lab and that jar went
very fast all the seeds went really quick so that was a super highlight hanging out with jackson and
finally getting to talk to him um about like the breeding stuff was incredible um he he talked about
some of these just his breeding work and being able to explore populations and gene pools and
really going through them and identifying recessive traits and going down different
you know paths and avenues and how he's able to you know work away from those deleterious
recessive traits in some of his lines and develop some of the stuff that he's been producing over
the years he gave me some flowers um that all had some some seeds in them which is awesome and uh
so that was great um i learned that he and i have some close old friends and that was really
really cool but um yeah i unfortunately didn't get to see much of the panels or any of the
the discussion on saturday but um oh what i did i bumped into um
to tim blake and we got to talk about the emerald cup and that was a really good conversation
amazing yeah yeah um and it was me and bam so um we got to you know go over what happened and
it was interesting and he got he relayed some of his interactions with the dcc in the aftermath
and the fallout and it really sounds like they um
the dcc got the message to a certain extent and not only that the dcc lawyers it seems told them
that they completely fucked up and probably if anybody who was technically i could file a lawsuit
i don't think i have very good grounds or like the remedy in my case isn't very good it's basically
just saying like tsk tsk you can't do that um everybody who lost actual um
you know possessions they have an incredible like basis for a lawsuit um the dcc from what i've been
told said that they are aware that they had no jurisdiction and authority to interact with any of
the attendees and that going forward in the future at any events emerald cup or otherwise they will
not be they will never be interacting with the attendees again so that i feel like that's the
result of everybody you know i did trolling but like a lot of people actually went directly to
them uh them being the dcc and you know told them what they did and put them on blast for
how they behaved at the emerald cup and they got the message and i believe internally through the
like legal they were informed of just how badly they had fucked up in the liability they created
for themselves and went into their meeting with um tim blake and the emerald cup very apologetic
and giving pretty concrete statements at least about what they were going to do in terms of
reforms um i think that in light of that a lawsuit would be a way of making those statements
concrete in the form of a um a determination by a judge because essentially what happened
is and the position of the dcc is that everybody who handed over their possessions
voluntarily surrendered their possessions and that the dcc did not confiscate
seize or destroy any cannabis at the event and that's just not what happened people were
threatened with an ultimatum give us what you have or else by somebody who presented a badge
and claimed to be a representative of a state enforcement oper uh agency and that if the person
failed to comply that there would be consequences and so that's that's not voluntary um surrender
that's a coercive seizure and i think that you know people actually exercising their rights and
doing some form of class action lawsuit or just individual lawsuits if anyone who was harmed
you know i could theoretically but there are also other individuals and i've reached out to a couple
of them and that was really one of the things that i think you know it's interesting that
the dcc has um from you know higher up top brass uh immediately change their tune but it would be
nice to get that actually in something more than just uh just some some words get some
legal judgment behind it so yeah that was that was the the main thing i i
saw a bunch of other people um there was lots of lots of great flowers lots of great genetics um
really good hash so it's an event that is unique it's kind of you know what the emerald cup
was in a lot of ways in terms of everybody showing up with their best stuff unfortunately
i didn't make it over to the other um sesh that happened on in seed swap that happened on sunday
there was another one um over at hugelville with joey burger and uh humble local and a bunch of
people were there lots of people from the regen conference uh made the trip over there bam and i
would have but we just i had to drive back to sac that night after driving to santa cruz so we didn't
make it over but um overall regen conference was awesome and from everything that i've heard
the um the hugelville uh seed swap was also a huge success so it's great to see that like
everybody got together up in humboldt and was able to have their have their events and their
gatherings and make their exchanges and do the things that we used to do back in the day so that
was awesome yeah trevor i shortly after uh me and gavino left when we were hanging out we went over
to to emerald organics to hugelville and um it was freaking sweet you know i was kind of bummed uh
to be leaving the the conference um but i definitely i had some friends that were showing up
over over at hugelville and yeah it was quite the gathering um once i got there i wasn't as bummed
there was a pretty large turnout it was really nice to see um you know uh a working regenerative
farm there yeah and like you said there was a lot of people from the conference and it was
unfortunate that there's the kind of schedule conflict um you know it really kind of was it
divided a lot of the people who would have been at either event but um yeah super cool to be able
to make it over there it was it's a absolutely beautiful very unique property i've been to a lot
of different properties around humboldt and and that one in particular was um just incredible um
they had two huge massive ponds on the site with a few million gallons of water storage um and that
in humboldt is a rarity in its own and yeah it was just uh really nice to see the work that that joey
did over there um i kind of watched that project from the beginning before there was there was still
smart pots it was 200 smart pots and uh you know they just went at it and and completely transformed
the look of that hillside where they had been doing their their i think 5 000 or 10 000 square
feet of outdoor so yeah i was bummed that uh that you weren't there but i figured it was just it was
crazy you know it was at the same time i wanted to stick around and and hear you talk and i saw
doc ray was up on stage i would have really liked to have seen seen him speak uh and kind of rode
that out until the end but um yeah for that the regen conference and in both the hugelveld thing
were just extremely like great vibes you know it was really like it felt so good to have that sense
of culture and community with everybody gathered trading sharing um trading stories you know
experiences and and yeah it's it's nice to to see that and i'm really glad that you uh got kind of
got the the inside scoop from tim about the dcc and and kind of you know they they admitted it
firsthand that they fucked up and going forward you know hopefully next year um it looks it looks
better because of the dialogue that was had so i'm optimistic that that next year's emerald
cup won't be as nearly as much of a debacle when it comes to kind of uh enforcement
yeah no i think i think that it and really just a couple months from now actually is the
real cup um and that i don't think we're gonna see that again um what we may see in the future
is a stronger law enforcement presence um that's kind of the alternative uh
what they recognized was that they are not law enforcement they have no jurisdiction over
uh you know random civilians that's for law enforcement for the santa rosa police department
sheriff's department whoever it is not the jurisdiction of the dcc to regulate
random people walking around with cannabis they're there to regulate the licensed operators
and the event itself so the event is a licensed operation and all of the different vending booths
are licensed operations all of the attendees are not in the purview of the dcc and so
um i think it could be a win on that level but who knows they may there may be a stronger law
enforcement presence in the future um just as a way of enforcement because that's how they do
yeah i hopefully not but you make a really good point that seems like a very possible scenario
right there and hopefully that the police there use a little bit more discretion when they see
people and in someone a untrimmed branch of weed at least i hope you know yeah no great point i
think we will because a last thing they want to do is fuck around with some dumb shit like that
um so overall i felt good it was really good to talk to tim and to hear about things from
his perspective and about the meetings that they had with the dcc subsequently um yeah and just
overall it was great to see kev um krebs always like he's a ball of energy he's got great stories
and he he's somebody who provides information to people that is incredibly useful um and i just
feel like he's been doing it for so long that and you know kevin and i have had our differences uh
the whole phylos thing i you know i was critical of kev at the time um regarding his position on it
and i just want to give him a lot of credit for being somebody who even though i've been petty
and small and like made dumb memes and been like fuck you kev he um he's somebody who's just super
cool and won't let that get in the way uh he was the reason i was at the regen conference
he invited me there and so kev's just he's an awesome dude yeah that's that's crazy
that's um kevin is a real he's just a real dude you know he really cares about the community
he cares about the plant um he's really as josh said he's got his pulse right on the industry
and um yeah he's a he's a funny guy like with him up on the stage it was just you know and
entertaining he's he's he's a solid guy i'm stoked that i got to talk to him he gave me some of those
the preservation projects i can't remember the specific afghani cultivar that he's working with
but he handed me a pack of those seeds and it's a you know it was an honor and it was cool running
into you and that was like my highlight of that whole event was just yeah the community um i had
got to run into meet and talk to so many different people that i have the this online relationship
with where we talk and we're you know in contact rather regularly and to get to kind of put faces
to names and get to see everybody and just be in each other's presence was was really special
especially after the last few years of just kind of um you know just the lack of that going on
it was really really cool to to get to connect with everybody
yeah yeah um seeing bob was incredible for that reason in particular like
it's been three or four years and not just three or four years you know
very isolated three or a couple years out of that and yeah it was great to see him um
what he brought to the table and the work that he's been done doing over these last couple years
is incredible so um i encourage everybody to go over to crickets and cicadas look at the
the work that he's been doing if you can find you know find the packs i was lucky enough to get
the peshawar um pakistani open pollination that he did it's a reproduction of something that bode
had put out um many years ago and i also got the puck uh backcross two and the um
i think the pacific northwest uh puck backcross number one so those those two were both just
phenomenal in the jar and he's a he's an exceptional grower he's somebody who
yeah it's hard to match what he does also what jackson i got um the cherry pie cross to the
cherry lime f5 and he talked specifically about how he was able to track through that line the
recessive leaf morphology and growth type that you see in the um the og kush breath sort of
sort of purple urkel weird mutant uh recessive that is in that population and how it would pop
up through different um different lines as he took it from the original f1 all the way to the f5
on the uh on the cherry lime side and how he then had to work with that with the cherry pie
and select it correctly to be able to produce the you know an f1 population that didn't express any
of that recessive trait because it's not a true f1 and that was part of the discussion is that
because they're related previously down the line he was doing that breeding work to try and
isolate a breeding pair or breeding male from the cherry five cherry lime f5 that he could cross
with the cherry pie that wouldn't produce that um that recessive trait mostly just because it creates
off types and those off types have very slow growth and aren't necessarily the best for
commercial production particularly if you're trying to produce a uniform crop so it was great to
you know have jackson explain and go through this in great detail how he actually bred away from
a deleterious recessive trait specifically by knowing his what his plant stock was
that the recessive trait was present and how to select specifically within a line uh you know he
the f5 he had line bred that all the way down to the f5 and specifically selected in the population
a line that didn't carry that recessive trait um and i got i believe something i think i got the cola
um yeah and jackson jackson grows the fire so these samples are incredible great smoke and
occasional bag seeds so that's that's lovely and um yeah all of the hash you mentioned
govino i think is his name um incredible hash maker lots of different samples really good nose
unique profiles that i haven't really smelled in hash before i can't remember what the cross was
that he washed but it's got this floral sort of i don't even know how to describe it that's
that's one of the things there's so many profiles and great flower expressions that i was saying
that you know words don't even do them justice or i'm just uh i've been puffing too much and can't
describe it yeah you know i'm i'm so blessed that uh that dude came not came into my life but uh
well yeah kind of he's just been a really good friend right since we uh first met we hit it off
and he is a great hash maker and he really puts his heart and soul into it and he's a really
hard worker and he kind of saved my operations ass this year um he had a large part to do with that
he really helped out and uh yeah he's definitely a solid guy and i'm blessed and now you have some
of his his product and yeah i got a fat jar just like 50 different kinds of hash from him so um
yeah i'd say it was great man and here yeah hearing you know you talking about i can't remember who
who his name is but just people who are working lines and they're really taking it upon themselves
to kind of to do real breeding and not just chucking pollen around willy-nilly um and really
breeding with a purpose and then kind of problem solving through that breeding it's a great um i
just i love hearing those kind of conversations it's uh for me just hearing that passion and the
the enthusiasm and and just yeah it just it really resonates with me and it gets me gets me excited
hearing uh nick from green source talk about him uh working his his pink coffee line i think it is
where he's doing his coffee f8s with his pinkleberry and he's trying to just get uniformity in his uh
you know in that pink stigma expression um to me that's something i'm really looking forward to
once i have the time and space to really be working lines and and there's nothing that's
probably if i was a lottery winner multi-millionaire billionaire what i would be
doing with my time would just be working lines and just uh you know trying to do projects like
that because it's fulfilling you know it's a fulfilling thing to watch that come to fruition
and like i said just here just in general hearing people who are passionate about their realm and
their whatever it is that they're doing it's it's so beautiful to to kind of be a part of that and
to to share um you know what you're passionate about and yeah just really i think most people
left that event uh feeling really good and kind of rejuvenated and um just yeah it's just leaving
that like i feel fresh i'm i'm excited i have a whole bunch of projects that i want to work on
i have a whole bunch of seeds that i want to pop now a whole bunch of weed that i want to smoke
and yeah i was just all around awesome time looking forward to it uh looking forward to it
next year already but at the same time like you trevor today i was burnt out slept in late just
was super lazy took a long time to kind of get my bearings um but yeah it was it was a blast
yeah yeah it definitely was um shout out to josh dutch bloom for for putting it on um i also know
uh fumie um and steve potentonix they were instrumental they helped do a lot of the um
the video recording and stuff and um just dealing with a lot of the logistics um
one of the things that happened or was part of the the overall presentation was um
wade laughter is somebody who's been in the community for a long time and wade's he's got
cancer and he's dying and he he did a video presentation and it was really really moving
um i hope when all the different materials get put up online people are able to watch it um
wade was he's he didn't breed but he found and kept and shared the harlequin with the community
back in the early days of the the bay area medical scene and the the rediscovery of cbd genetics and
chemotypes um at least in the bay area medical sort of world um and so he was
instrumental in getting that cut out to the world and he's been somebody who's been involved in the
cannabis scene for a long time here and yeah he he gave a presentation and did you know he's somebody
who took the opportunity of his where he's at in life to really connect with a group of people
and to communicate with a community with his community in a way that was really beautiful
and to talk to people in a frank and open manner about mortality and you know coming to the end of
your life and coming to terms with what you've done and where you've been and sort of like
the meaning of life to a certain extent and just encouraging people to move in this world from a
place of love and being heartful and it was it was very moving and beautiful and i just i hope
everybody gets to see it and that was another highlight uh there this is you know there were
many many highlights it was one of those things where pretty much every different presentation
there was information that people could get out of it and yeah so i encourage people to attend
there's going to be three more um regen conferences this year oklahoma michigan and maine i believe
and um then yeah next year uh it will be coming back around i believe so be on the lookout for it
and just yeah support support the regen community in all of its different facets that's the thing
i'd say because both of the events that happened over the weekend were really great exemplars of
what the cannabis community's been all about from what i've come from you know over the last 20 30
years of the medical scene like if it still exists in california um it was best exemplified
this weekend in both of these events and i think in equal proportions like props to both groups
that put on events props to joey and to josh yes agreed and for anybody on the fence about this
um you know the the price of admission comes with uh with some seeds that you'll get at some point
um josh is doing he's he's sending out people seeds with uh i think it's a gmo or no it's a
a root beer cross with a chem special reserve which is definitely something that i'm very excited about
and then he has plans some sort of plans to reimburse people for ticket prices down the road
and in a couple years maybe he's got some kind of crypto nft project along with those seeds that he's
he's currently working out the logistics so um would either way i mean you're gonna leave with
a pack of you know incredibly you know awesome seeds and then on top of that you know whether
this project comes to fruition or not um you know i'm i'm personally fine with it not but if it does
you know he's talking about people being reimbursed for the price of their admittance um down the road
so it was yeah it was incredible um i'm actually kind of talking with with josh about getting
something together in in upstate new york next year i have a lot of friends and that's where i'm
from originally and i have a lot of friends and family and community over there and i think that
you know it's really important that we as a community kind of think about this especially
as an emerging industry and talk about regenerative practices because that that's
not going to be the default that we're seeing um you know operations uh being regenerative or trying
to be sustainable um it's really not going to be the standard so i think as a community we should
really be pushing for that and educating people and these events are a perfect place to kind of get
some of that um some of that intel and and knowledge out there to folks what's happening y'all
what's up jb organic christ how you doing brother
organer kissed yeah let's not get into some
no no worries i just don't want to get into religion yet we'll do that later
yeah i've been told it's rude to discuss that yeah so uh yeah my buddy uh hit me up and was
like yeah you need to join this uh breeding group on the clubhouse and i was like i've never been
on this thing and like i don't really know what i'm doing but so i'm just here i appreciate all
y'all having like a forum for this kind of conversation um the reason why i actually said
i want to talk in this uh conversation is because i as soon as i log on y'all are talking about nfts
related to seeds and uh i have a lot of information that i can share with y'all about how that can
actually happen i i did an nftc release um on the cardano blockchain about two years ago and uh
and so there's i have i have some you know i i can add value to this conversation in that way
you know you should definitely um josh uh joshua rutherford or dutch balloons he's the man in
question who's who's trying to get this thing started and i'm sure that um he'd be very very um
excited to have have that kind of that conversation with you because yeah he it's an idea that he has
but he's trying to really um you know make it a reality and um you know seeing you already have
that kind of that kind of experience and you've you've done it that's that's huge and i'm sure
he could benefit greatly and you guys yeah we uh we you know i i love breeding cannabis you know
just you know uh blood diamond seeds.com baby uh you know uh and so uh it was just it just made
sense like we got into cryptocurrency and blockchain and like you know and it was like
what would this you know how can these things come together like jetsons and little house in
the prairie you know i'm saying it was like take what we do uh on both sides of this and uh how do
we bring them together and um what's really cool about the nft with seeds is the metadata that you
can put into the nft into the blockchain forever so you can put in you know all the lineages and
like everything and like you know flowering time potential terpenes and it's locked in the blockchain
forever and can never be deleted and you know that's you know that's it's there's something
valuable about that the first ever nft seed associated drop was actually like someone
so i forget who it was but they like sold a painting like an actual painting that was associated with
nfts and then you got seeds from that but it wasn't each pack of seeds had a unique qr code
that you could access your own digital art and have it tracked to the blockchain back to that
actual pack of seeds and what we did was we sealed every pack with a wax seal so obviously it's like
you get a wax sealed vial of seeds you look on the blockchain it's like this is exactly what it is
you know that's the highest level of validation of genetics and like once i found out about that
technology i was like let's just freaking go man so yeah you know like you can do blockchain
explorer you can go into cardano blockchain explorer and like see beskar on the blockchain
yeah and i can help anyone do it that's no problem you know it's something that kevin jodrey was
talking about was um just even having blockchain associated with like a licensed facility who's
district are in a distributor and going into the retail to make sure that you're kind of
it is an insurance that you get you know paid out if everything is on blockchain
there's no kind of funny business that can happen behind the scenes and how that could be and
there's a lot of funny business happening behind the scenes as far as distributors and uh you know
hash makers and uh the the retail front versus the farms and how much you know it's like an
honor system and there's a lot of lot of um yeah fuckery going on to put it um to put it bluntly
and how this could really reduce um the amount of kind of shady practices that people are doing
and how to start incorporating that and i think right now i mean obviously we're on the very
very beginning edge of that but that's what we're going to be looking at here in the next
in the coming years we're going to be seeing that on roll rolling out um i'm assuming it's going to
be standard um here shortly yeah i totally agree oh pardon me i just wanted to say that you know we
yes this is awesome i'm so glad that the conversation is here but you know it's like we've
also when the open cannabis project devolved a bit over two years ago you know we started the
ethical data alliance and uh that's why we started it because we have uh we have uh like we have
blockchain and crypto experts we have the harvard professor who teaches blockchain on our board
it's all about cannabis we've been running pilots to kind of showcase because i think that it goes
like a step beyond um and i might i think it's tokenization and i think that nft is just um
non-fungible tokens are just one type of token there's so many different types of tokens and i
think it's um you know it's smart contracts there's all these other ways that you can plug and play and
we did like a deep dive where we spent six months like really learning about blockchain technology
and what that means and how because there's so many issues in the cannabis space and where
blockchain can come in and help us because i think we had this conversation a little bit earlier
in the room tonight even is that you know our cts tracking systems that we are required like
franwell has this kind of obscure monopoly with metric but it's not quite good enough um for a
lot of the different functions and so supply chain traceability is like a major issue within the
industry as a whole and i think that the tokenization and how we can do that third-party
certification and it's like a so what we've been doing for the past couple years is like running
uh proof of concept pilots with the blockchain from like even like from the genomics to with the
breeders and genomics and the nursery to the producers um to the cultivation data to like the
um uh you know terroir and all the different things and any sort of third-party certifications
and then all of the post-production certifications and then you know it's literally like it's so deep
how deep you can go and then the missing link is even and there's like there's like grading
certifications and other things that you can also get like you sure your flower is good but like
has it been able to pass like a third-party grading certification or your product also like
and then if the product goes and is made into a flower and then at the very end point like this
and then there's also like the the ip piece with the um how the blockchain can tag in there too
like back with the genetics it's we have different groups working on um different kind of proofs of
concept of you know whether it's genomic companies or candor or canopy right or somebody kind of also
showcasing like this is um you know just more data and you can dig as deep and showcase as much
as it's it's a storytelling capacity and that's where the blockchain for me is like an ability
for the cannabis industry to tell the story of our supply chain traceability and how we are actually
taking ownership over that and that we can and to me it's also the future of shopping because then
at the end of the day it's a way for the end consumer to plug and play back in and be like oh
my god anthony bred this incredible genetic it has you know and then i can actually look back
this is the lineage and these are the plants and then hopefully with you know the future of like
machine learning and other things eventually we'll be able to get to the point where you'll be able
to like plug and play the consumer can put back in their data like oh i loved what you've read here
this is so incredible what other things are kind of in the same category so i think that you know
yes nfts token is they have a function with tokenization and i think there's a lot of jokes
in the industry about nfts but i think that it's like the deeper ability for supply chain traceability
and um and storytelling and because the breeder stories so often get lost also and the seed
stories and we talked about that a couple weeks ago and i think it's a great it's a great function
for people to storytell even cultivators too imagine this you pop you know 100 seeds and you
have all unique phenotypes and you tie each phenotype of that cross to the blockchain so when
somebody goes to buy your you know gorilla poop or whatever it'll be tied to the blockchain what
pheno it is because how many times have we gone to buy weed and it's like it's not the right pheno
or buy cuts so imagine tying clones to the blockchain being like it's tracked with nft technology
from the original genetics all the way through you'll never get cut fished again you know so
that's what i think it could be really cool about it you know accountability in this game nobody
wants it uh because you have to be honest but uh the honest people in this game really enjoy this
technology and it sounds like you're very passionate i'm not sure who was just speaking but
you you sound very passionate about the data and and and it sounds really good to me i'm really
glad i joined this i've spent two years i've spent two years working on i'm a board member of it
sounds like it and that's that's literally what we do and what we've been doing and it's an open
source and i've invited everybody's everybody's welcome um what we observed because also earlier
in this conversation was that that was brought up i mean it was kind of birthed out of the phyloscape
drama of uh some concepts around what the open cannabis project had originally been
help you know the idea that we could help protect breeders and that we could help um
you know that i still believed in that vision of the open cannabis project so i was sad because it
had the ties to phylos and i still cared about deeply about the genetics and so there's a group
of us some of the former board members from there and we were like well if we're gonna do something
we need it to be like foolproof full transparency for the industry and also that it is it's like a
gift back to the industry and how you can plug and play with it and it literally like i mean
it's like we've all been working on this project for two years with um you know volunteer and i
mean that's how much i care about cannabis genetics is like i've spent you know i've been
on calls three times a week for two years plus plus and fundraising for this and and we're and
you know like we finally got a grant from file coin because they believed in our vision um but i
will say that you know that was kind of my goal is like okay let's let's give it back because we
know that the breeders in the community if we're doing something unethical then they're gonna
poke holes in this so we've got a like really and then all of a sudden over the past year like the
nft craze became like a thing but we've already been working very diligently on this project and
the pilots and trying to show a proof of concept that there is a way um and we've gotten a lot of
different directions you know with different people coming in but for me it's beyond the data
it's about my personal passion with it is like it's about the genetics it's about how we can um
do what you just said you know like prove the um we can prove that it is the thing and there's other
companies that have come out just recently actually maybe think that ryan i'd love to um
get your perspective there's some new companies trying to kind of come on board in the genomic
space and saying that they have like a it's like i don't know what they're calling it fingerprint
something it's an interesting concept but it's like you still in order to prove that what you
have is actually what you have you're like oh i have the sunday driver's breeders cut well it's
like well you and everybody even just i'm i had to jump off a little bit ago and i ended up on a
whole call about genetics and you know it's just like the it's the emergency call of like okay it's
gotta be what the market wants otherwise it's like we're wasting our time essentially and it's an
unfortunate conversation but it's just like and there's that conversation well is it ice cream
cake runs or is it ice cream cake or what is it and like why do people want just everything to be
you know this blingy thing that everybody calls runs but like is it even runs and doesn't even
yield and like just stupid conversations but and what's pinot type exactly yeah like what is it is
it this one or that one and and nobody can really prove that but this new genomics company is saying
that they can essentially um it but it requires um and it's affordable and basically it would be
like the you get a tissue sample from the actual breeders cut and then you show that you have that
breeders cut and you compare the two and then you have like a third-party certification that it
actually is what it says it is so and it doesn't have pop light and virus well that's a different
test but i mean these things all caught they they cost money right so it's like remember remember to
claim your star on the galaxy galaxy how much that costs like it's going to be a similar kind of thing
right and so what are we really trying to do are we trying to genetically identify single plants we
can do that with other technologies other than sequencing and be highly accurate like for example
when the fbi wants to figure out like compare somebody to a crime scene they don't sequence
the genome of the person right they do a test called a vtr a variable nucleotide tandem repeat
it's just like a little stutter in the dna mechanism and these things happen in in lines
in you know in chromosomes and then they get passed on to different lines and you can probably
think you know if you got one chromosome from mom and one from dad those different chromosomes
each have like different stutters you might think between genes okay and those little stutters you
can like pick up using a genetic test that cost maybe in the 30 range rather than like the 350
dollar range so in my opinion like something like that would be sufficient
is you know to do what we call genetic individualization right but again you have to ask
yourself like how many times does that get done through the supply chain and what cost does that
end up adding on to the product that's my problem with these things because there are a few companies
that are going around now and there's not there's a few of them and they're all saying use our tech
to do dna certification supply chain like confirmations of you know this clone whatever
it's useful but at what cost you know and and how seriously do you want to do it and
how many samples you know we're really trying to show that something is you know it's like you were
talking about the seed and the seed certification right like you know in c certifications that
somebody pulls up with like a train load of grain like a train car load of grain and they go in with
a big dipper stick and they pull out you know random samples according to a sampling procedure
well it's going to be need to be the same thing right and that needs to be done at the at the
nursery that needs to be done at the growers place post-harvest needs to be done it needs to
be done again in the supply chain right like later on the supply chain maybe right and so what's the
cost what does that add up to right and especially if you're doing it through sequencing and that's
just to get the genetic data then you have to put it onto the blockchain like it's not just like
walking up with a cell phone and scanning it boom you're on the blockchain right like there's a whole
bunch of costs that have to get there so all i'm saying is are we really prepared to and do we
really need to put all these things into the you know into there i personally think that like
you know we're already doing analytical chemistry and analytical chemistry is essentially
a mirror image of the genome right like in the genome you can go in and look and say hey this
plant if you know what to look for you can say this plant's gonna be like a beta-caryopylene
dominant plant you know with limonene and myrcene and probably high cannabinoid content
do you need to do that with a genetic test we're already doing a cannabinoid test and
terpene test right which is a chemical fingerprint it's not a genetic fingerprint
but chemical fingerprints at least for special plants are usually like
somewhat you know desirable and unique right and so i think that you can use a test that we already
does that we already do to kind of verify the same thing without having to do this expensive genetic
test every time and you know the people that i've seen mostly telling us how important it is that we
do this are the guys that are selling the tests right like of course they want us to use the test
i i'm not sure i see how crucial it is for some like high-end pharma products that are
demanding you know i mean if you got like a specific say you're gonna brand like
like a a pharmaceutically approved formulation right that has to be rigid and like it has to be
what they say it is every time like they're probably going to want to verify that the crop
they're buying is from like a specific cbdb plant or whatever right but like is it really necessary
for us to put that on to every aspect of the cannabis supply supply chain i don't know i think
no i think only for like a nursery i think for like a nursery standpoint so it's like what you're
getting is actually what you're getting and i think that part of yes i told i mean i think it's really
like i totally agree with you ryan because i think that the um i think maybe from a nursery
and breeding standpoint it becomes important but at the end of the day you know we were having all
of these issues with the renaming issue a lot too because i think for patients when you have to think
like we're advocating for people that need consistent medicine still because we are in
this weird space with the you know the regulated market and the non-regulated market or just the
medical days of your you know like and it's just a i don't know maybe you guys have a different
system in canada that makes it more efficient for people but i do know that people need reliable
trustworthy medicine and when they find something that works for them i really i really still want
people to have access to that you know like i mean i'll just use white widow as an example white
widow historically has been really good for people's pain and i think that if somebody knows
that that's good medicine and good pain for them i mean i just had this conversation other times
today where you know it's like you know you go in you can go into a dispensary and a lot of times
you could be like oh let in oregon we're allowed to like see and smell it's more like deli style
where in cali you guys don't have that um which is maybe also part of the problem because here it's
like if you're like hey let me see that and you know i can tell you when i know something's not
what it is you're like oh let me see the you know fatso or whatever and they're like oh okay they're
trying to pawn something off that is not by any means what it actually is i think that that's
where maybe it becomes more of an issue and maybe that we don't need complex genomic testing for
that but i think that you know and i've had that in the past where things have randomly gotten
mixed up and i'm looking i'm like looking at the terapine profile and i'm like well that sure isn't
what it's supposed to be you know and like something got mixed up like a cut got mixed up
along the line that sucks i mean i wonder if it's like trust me you gotta figure out what it is
trust me it's like a battle yeah but it's not only that it's like you'd think that like look
everybody lives in a in a you've got that kind of farmer's market model or deli style model where
it's like they give it to you in bulk and then you can break down the packaging is that the deal
is that what you're saying so in oregon we're allowed or can we have some like really cool
rules that i think and this is kind of where i get frustrated with the regulated legal market
because they see something that works in one state and it's not like you're seeing other states
being like oh well that worked really well for those states and that failed miserably for those
states so let's make our rules based on what's working for everybody and what's creating a
thriving market so in oregon farm like i as a recreational farmer i'm allowed to sell directly
to dispensaries and it's awesome and then the dispensaries are allowed to have like jars of
product on the shelf and then you know people can say like i want that nug in the corner over there
you know like that's the one and it's i hear funny things too from people but in cali it's not like
that at all like farms aren't allowed to sell directly to dispensaries they have to work with
distribution and so there's like this weird middle area and then the distribution's like oh well you
know rents is what's selling this week so let's just slap that name on it and you know put it in
some package and send it off so it's like you don't it just that's where the supply chain
traceability issue kind of comes up is that people rename things and i think we've talked about this
in the past too not to bring up um i kind of want a different name for it but like formerly the
galaxy had that you know it's like when people send in their genomic samples that has like 28
different names but it's all actually blue dream and um you know that's it that actually happened
you know all these different people are like it's still happening to do some consulting with
some companies in canada and one of them is doing you know this kind of genomic analysis for nursery
for a nursery company and therefore you see that happen like if they get opportunities to do intake
from different companies and those companies have sourced genetics off the you know illicit market
like for sure we're seeing doubles show up named all these different things right and even on the
marketplace just even from analyzing flowers in the marketplace like we're also finding the same
thing these guys have one plant that they're they're getting eight bucks a gram these guys are
only getting four bucks a gram it's the same plant right and mark is under a different name um that's
that's all gonna go away eventually i don't know i i think honestly like this i it's funny that it's
been so come down the way and i've chased clones too and found and got cloned half the time like
at least half the time what you get with the clone is not the plant that there or even if it is the
plant it's not worth the chase right it's like the reputation that a lot of these plants have
is just not merited and you can find plants that are way better than those things
and so for people that are like chasing down like whatever given name or you have to have the clone
only like it's kind of like chasing fiction right it really is chasing a fiction um that time would
be spent better off i think people going through seeds and you know when you're look this whole
disaster of chasing clones everybody's sharing clones to have the one that so and so says is
popular you know first of all who the fuck is so and so and why do we care what they want so bad
that we all have to shape our weed around that like that's just a dumb practice anyway but two
like hlvd broad bites russet bites just straight spider bites thrips like think of every bug
problem you've ever had it's probably come from a fucking clone trade right so like is this really
worth the practice that everybody's doing i don't personally think so i think that we should all go
back to seeds and start finding new stuff and then if shit truly is that good get you know
registered get it registered and licensed to a company that knows how to propagate it like
with genetic id and sterility right well i don't know we're not allowed to call it phenol hunting
right right now ryan i feel like in a perfect world where we're not like like it's just not
like a sustainable business model to do that in today's day and age it takes a lot of time to hunt
seeds but i completely agree and by the time you know everybody something super hype it's almost
too late i mean look what happened with ice cream cake in the last few years it became this kind of
meme of a of a strain and it became you know everybody was ranting and raving about it
and now it's like you can barely give them away um so but you know i don't know if that if the
whole misrepresenting things is ever gonna go away um just because looking at other industries
in particular there's a lot of parallels between the wine industry and the cannabis industry
in knockoff wines that is like a huge thing where people are are selling you know cheap uh what do
they call it like bottle wine uh just bulk wine and bottling it up and selling it as a vintage
that it's not and making you know something that's a three dollar bottle of wine into a
three hundred dollar bottle of wine um that happens all the time so so i don't know if we're gonna in
the wine industry is is very mature in comparison to the cannabis industry and they still haven't
really come up with a way to eliminate that from happening in their industry so i i think it's uh
you know it is a major issue because you know who i've seen people selling clones online for
three thousand bucks a cut um that could be anything these people like i mean they have like
a large enough following where it seems like they're not gonna be um really ripping people
off and doing any you know malicious shady business tactics but at the same time who's to
stop them from just you know finding a volunteer that they found and just chopping a clone from it
and they have no idea what it is and then there it is there's the three thousand dollar clone
so i'm you know i it's it's gonna be interesting to see how things unfold but like i was saying
dude i'm 100 with you on the the seed thing and i really think that the industry could benefit
greatly from that and talking about bugs i went to the emerald cup guess what i came home with
some cuts and some teens and guess what who else i brought home with me root aphids um
you know i i did a sulfur spray to combat any rust it might scoped everything just in case
dunked everything in soap and the one thing i didn't do was um you know pop the roots off and
see and you know well i did eventually but i didn't see any signs of of root aphids a couple
weeks later i popped my the pot off and boom there they are fucking root aphids and they just
contaminated you know my whole my home home grow so um it's a major issue and you know i'm all about
popping seeds and hunting but as far as the economical feasibility of that happening right
now with such tight margins and um it's it's really hard to put that into into reality at
this point in time i i love everything you just said except for the bug part at the end
but i totally i think that's all like super um yeah that's so accurate in such a it's just like
all true stories you know all that happens all the time and i think that that's why there are
so many jokes about all of those things in the industry unfortunately because i mean there's a
reason why we quarantine stuff but it's just amusing to me i just i do have to ask like if
those cuts were from like uh you know like a vendor or were they just from like somebody who
had cuts no it was a uh you know i can't remember who the vendor was in particular but it was a
vendor yeah yeah going forward cool that's really no going it's it's fucked up and going forward i'm
gonna really take note of like okay i got this from this vendor i wasn't i wasn't really thinking
about that but you know there should be some accountability and i'm sure there's other people
who bought teens from this vendor who have rudolphins um and it's really not cool and
it's really easy to happen and it's something that you know these conventions and stuff
you know it's it's it's super common and you know we're our own worst enemy honestly with
an industry i think that's true no it's true bad mother rooms or like but it's the west coast
with bugs i don't really care i'll get rid i've dealt with every bug and i'll you know they're a
nuisance and it's a pain in the ass but i'll get rid of them i'm mostly concerned about hoplite
and viroid because i am hunting a bunch of different seeds i do plan on having like my own
personal um selections of seeds that i hunt for my you know home grow and i really like bringing in
outside genetics it's like yeah bugs i'll get rid of them you know i've done it every bug i'll kill
but hoplite and viroid it's like what do you do you just go around and you you infect all of your
other plants that you've been hunting for you know don't use the same shares johnny no i know
i see jason down there in the audience and i can't remember the date off the top of my head
um but there's gonna be a deep dive on the hot slate and byroading so we can have
kind of more conversations about best practices but i definitely feel like making sure that you're
not um just remembering that alcohol doesn't kill it and that you're i mean that's the thing this is
where like bro bro that bounced out of here kind of bringing up the um uh i've recently the past
couple weeks i just want to call them nifties if nobody cares i'm just going to call them nifties
uh because nft just it's like the non-fungible token and then it's an nft and then somebody
recently was like really cute like thought that that's what it was called they were like
the nifties and i'm like no this is an nft but i'm like but i would think i like nifties better
um but that's where stuff like that comes in third-party certifications and so i think that
we really need to start demanding like at this point i won't take cuts from people unless um
unless i am certain and it's funny and i think that i don't know if it was ryan if it was you
um or if it was maybe it was a different conversation but there's definitely some
people in this space that are starting to say like oh it doesn't matter about hobslate and
viroid and i'm like okay i really don't really want to have that conversation but i don't agree
and i think it's a perfectly um i think we should make it common practice that we're asking like oh
have you um you know like have the i can see now i'm like i'm now i'm gonna get
flack from people who are saying it's not a big deal um so it's like i get i get it from both
sides hey you have to be willing to be offended to offend someone right oh i'm gonna offend
somebody generally all the time every day so it's kind of like at that point um uh but i think if we
gotta ask we have to really start asking and i always ask and johnny this is probably a good
practice and i know you know when you're at a cup and it's hard to have the conversation but i
feel like um i always ask people when i am taking plants or giving plants what uh you know what sort
of ipm schedule are they on because generally when plants are in immature or vegetative they are
in some sort of ipm um routine and i want to know especially if somebody has sprayed something on
those plants in the past 24 hours and um you know or just recently and if it would because some
things don't work well together and i think it's very fair questions to ask um have you had any
issues blah blah blah so you know just some of those things are hard to get rid of and they can
screw up your whole thing no i mean you make a good point too because for instance if somebody
they happen to bring plants that they they sulfur before they they go to an event you know you cut
you take it home and you want to do a preventative spray and then you spray some kind of horticultural
oil on it you know your your clones are going to be fried so no you make a really good point
the way i saw it is like i'm like okay like i'm gonna scope them i'm gonna look at them i'm just
gonna check and it's not like a super major deal like i said and of course i asked about their
practices and hopley and but it's so hard to get a straight answer from some of those people too
because they are they're they're just there they're working um a lot of times they're not necessarily
those operations are really big it's not even close to their department and they're just there
and they're like that but yeah like i you assume the risk and that's something that people should
realize if anything i knew the risk that i was that i you know was taking bringing in clones
and i do every single time and i've you know i i'll make it because for this it's not i'm i'm
bringing these plants into a facility and gonna gonna put them in into rotation just going to my
own i'm just little r and d and just for shits and giggles but um you know if people are you know
going to these events and they're trying to bring these these genetics into their facility um you
know obviously quarantining them asking these types of questions and really being cautious it's
it's you know like the people who say they don't care or hop latent is not a big deal i don't
i'm dealing with it firsthand it's it's really it is a big deal and it can really mess up a lot of
a lot of um you know plants money time um and it's it's hard to go back from there so that's like the
biggest deal i think and it can really it could put people out of business um and just you know
for me personally just i used to work at a nursery and when i would i would have plants and i would
i would run some of them and if a couple plants had hoplate and viroid the you know even with
living soil even with uh you know just biology and all these things that people claim that are
going to take care of and they're going to reduce symptoms i i could tell i could pick up the plant
after i harvested it and i can tell it's like okay this one has hoplate and it weighs a quarter or
half of the weight of the other plants the terpene profile isn't there it was really obvious and it
cuts in for people who are doing little small small time grows not a lot of plants if you have
a quarter of your plants that have hoplate and viroid that's it can be devastating so yeah it's
just educating people on these type of things it's important because it's going to be happening more
and more as these events are happening as there's more kind of purchasing of clones for strangers
and all these things this is going to be something that people are going to be dealing with in a
massive scale and it's already been people in the industry have been dealing with it for
for years and years but the the newcomer into the scene they don't know they're just going to assume
everything is good these people are there they're with a company that it's going to be clean
and that they would never have something that's going to compromise their their grow or their
facility and uh you know it's it's better to educate them now than for for people to learn
the hard way thanks johnny i think that's a really good point and i would be curious also
um you know ryan's perspectives because uh i totally agree with all of those things i think
that you know i and i've said this earlier as well tonight like that monocropping like we are
actually monocropping something so we need to be used caution because um you know i've seen all
sorts of weird things in other crops and in cannabis but i never thought and especially
when you start to push into different environments as my observation you know it's like people
trying to grow outdoors in like nevada and uh arizona you know you or even in greenhouses
it's like you end up with a whole different set of pest pressures and problems and diseases and
and so i think that you know we're still kind of in our infancy as far as like an actual
growing at scale and i think we need to use caution and i think that best practices
we're going to discuss next week i invited jason up to share with us but i believe it's next
tuesday um next tuesday at
6 p.m and it will be on um on clubhouse in his room uh
is it i'm not sure if it's grown tell jason thursday thursday thursday thursday it's always
thursdays like a gushy mushy pile at the end of the day so i was like you should come up and pitch
i was hoping london or peter would chime in yeah yeah no worries no worries i'm about to 8 a.m
8 a.m this morning literally like the whole entire day has been like we're out of my okay we're toast
at this point i hear you i i am toast myself it's getting late here uh on the east coast and i am
getting ready for bed myself i've been up since six so i feel you completely uh but yes we will
be talking uh this thursday so uh this week on thursday we're going to be talking about sugar
uh and then next week we're talking about hoplatin virus so february 10th thursday night
6 p.m pacific 9 p.m eastern we will be talking about the hoplatin viroid
um and uh the week after that actually since i'm going to go ahead and plug i might as well
the week after we're going to talk about uh spectrum uh i have the guys my friends from
science led will be joining us and we're going to talk about spectrum tuning and plant steering and
a whole bunch of the cool research that uh they've been uh working on uh recently so awesome stuff
but yes hoplatin viroid a week from thursday with evian and i think johnny you said you were
going to join us as well right we'll take that as a yes yeah you know i think johnny went and
disappeared into the black hole of the nature i love thursdays and listen to the grow and tell
it's you guys are dropping some serious knowledge bombs and people um it's just it's great for the
community dude what you're doing you're really um adding so much value and this is this is the type
of stuff that people pay pay good money to learn this type of stuff um so i highly recommend
everybody pop into those rooms and check it out really appreciate it yeah we uh we definitely have
a lot of fun and uh i i i get a mental workout every week trying to keep up with nick uh but
it's amazing how much that stuff is uh translating and sticking in my head i was actually listening to
a a medic a room on saturday that had a bunch of medical doctors talking and dr mark was in there
and they were talking about some chemical some chemistry processes that were going on and i was
like yeah that's exactly we were just talking about that or yeah no that's right you know it
was funny uh so it's great i uh i really appreciate uh the education and uh i was actually
just chatting with dick earlier because he was on jinx uh doing a live with jinx on instagram
talking about carbon and and carbon is one of nick's favorite topic everything is about carbon
exchange uh and everything is because these are carbon-based uh plants and you know everything
that we're trying to produce terpenes and all of the cannabinoids are like 90 95 carbon
uh so yeah carbon is a really really important topic and it's good to talk about i think i love
talking about different topics every week and parts of science that most people don't we don't
really usually cover in a lot of these basic cannabis rooms please tell me you talked about
carbon credits oh absolutely yay okay cool i missed it so i'm well well not not carbon credits
from uh not carbon credit from a uh like from a uh trading standpoint in the environment but
the carbon credits that are exchanged uh through every operation of the plant we did get into that
i really um think that it's uh needs to become like a lobbying move for especially as things
continue to scale up i think that um especially like hemp farmers at scale and i think that uh
you know even cannabis if there can if i mean obviously there's a lot of ifs in there but i do
see that there is potential especially with the um uh the united nations uh i don't know if you
guys are familiar with the sustainable development goals but with agriculture there's a lot of you
know markers that they're trying to push for coming up over the next i think it's like they
pushed the they pushed it back maybe to 2030 but i think that carbon credits and cannabis uh needs
to be a huge part of the conversation um coming up i've heard all this terpene credits as well
oh terpene credits would be fantastic that's got to be a paul von hartman
concept terpene credits yeah we just don't have the hard science to like back to that uh
carbon credits are a real thing like even right now you can actually um with agriculture you can
actually um you know there are things they already exist by state yep it yep it varies state by
state i think it's also um one of the things that we really have to do is we have to stop tilling
right uh tilling is one of the larger contributors to co2 pollution in the atmosphere and they you
know they have maps nasa nasa has maps and you can see the carbon uh explosion uh that gets released
the co2 uh explosion that happens during the tilling of the fields in the early spring
when those fields are getting prepared in most of the u.s and you can see it move in different parts
of the u.s as as the growing season uh changes so it's crazy how much carbon gets released not to
mention all the other things that it does to the soil but uh just to stop carbon release we need
to stop tilling the fields uh and it's great to grow hemp but we need to make sure that they're
doing things that keep the carbon that's being grown and uses the carbon um you know burning
the carbon burning those plants doesn't necessarily keep the carbon and um you know stripping them out
of the ground after we grow them and stripping the minerals and the soil from the soil and
everything else doesn't help so we need to make sure that it's being done in a sustainable fashion
uh to to help uh return some of the natural balances to the soil around the around the globe
yeah it's definitely a more complicated conversation that's why like it's like
just touching on the maybe it's part of it but it definitely is deeper um
yeah that's that's that's definitely a topic we can get into actually on a future grow and tell
instead of necessarily a breeder panel but
definitely slightly off topic unless i guess we're going to talk about breeding cultivars that are
fast growing hemp strains that help with carbon sequestration and capture
well that actually is a thing and and ryan um that's actually a good to bring it back to the
breeding point um i mean i know that that was one of the places when you were asked earlier like we
that little bit of a conversation because i would be curious now your perspective i i remember
i'm trying to remember who exactly was speaking to this and if it was specifically crisper but
there is a lot of conversations about um breeding fiber varieties for um
gosh what was it for in i don't know if it was for increased carbon specifically but things along
those lines is like that they were really looking into um you know just kind of messing
with the genetics on that level i'm sure so many people are doing that at this point
do you have thoughts ryan johnny did you have thoughts
hey i'm really i'm okay if you can repeat what you were saying i i got a call from a buddy and i was
i was out and i missed uh the last like minute or two of conversation
we were just so if you want to kind of dive in and let me know what and what you guys were talking
about i'd love to yeah let me jump in and maybe that will fill you in um so yeah no i i think it
is important um it's a different aspect of cultivation and breeding that we don't often
talk about i think it is important that we look at ways uh you know at possibly growing some of
these faster growing uh much more uh foliar dense foliage dense or carbon sequestering dense type of
plants there's going to need to be a lot of different types of plants that get developed
because you need different parts of the plant for different industries uh you know hempcrete
needs the herd needs that core so you need plants that are very fat but have very thin outer skins
you know if you're doing textiles or fabrics you need really really good fiber on the outside on
the stocks if you're using the the floss uh you know for for doing for doing stuff that's a
different piece of you growing the seed for food or oil there's just all these different production
mechanisms uh and and you can't grow one plant that satisfies each of those industrial needs
let alone each of our own uh you know our own biochemical needs i guess is the best way to put
it so uh we do need lots and lots of different cultivars so i think that's just one more uh
exciting or interesting way of breeding for intent uh would be to breed plants that were
going to be super fast growing and maybe sequester as much carbon as possible and i think now that i
think about it it was a hemp variety and i believe it was there were some universities working on the
perfect hemp variety for um for hempcrete now that i'm like listening to you go over those and and
also it's like having the correct machinery to work with the different things because i know for a
while i kind of got obsessed with the idea that we were going to breed the perfect trifecta crop
and i that was i other people are doing way more like way doing work it's like that's not an easy
to um to do also so ryan what are your perspectives um i missed part of what you're saying sorry i
didn't i i didn't hear that um what you're saying so i was well i missed out but you were talking
about sequestration of carbon yeah we were just talking about like because you had earlier brought
up like again they're like you know ethically with the crisper piece like how there is feelings
about that and then it reminded me um jason we were talking about carbon and then i kind of
was like oh yeah there's people were working to breed different hemp varieties specifically
targeted for like breeding the perfect thing for hempcrete and uh breeding plants that are you
know producing using crisper technology basically because people are already there's a lot of
universities and actually uh ties back to some interesting other like uh ip conversations but um
you know just what you think about that you know people are working to
use that technology far more targeted specifics um beyond just like high thc content or whatever
yeah well i mean look cannabis is a really incredible plant with a lot of really incredible
traits that we can modify slightly for our own benefit right so everything that we do with the
plant can be optimized through breeding probably in some way like even do you know what graphene is
right like they're making graphene out of hemp fiber so i'm sure that you could breed
a specific hemp fiber that would make a better graphene or they would be more suitable for
batteries
what was it's canaff right you used to do graphene came from canaff previously and that they were
trying to shift it over from canaff production to hemp production i think if i remember correctly
it's like a few years ago if you guys are familiar with that canaff is like a really weird weird
plant but it's very similar to the people grew it before when there was the prohibition on hemp
production for growing cana for the similar purposes like what they use graphene um graphing
and um they have a couple other products they make and they actually use it in the oil drilling
world so it's like you know cultivar that specifically does that you know that's kind of
crazy but as far as um like the carbon sequestration thing that's typically done i think it was jason
i'm sorry i wasn't again without the phone i was talking about um you know the the tilling the
issues with tilling it what we're doing is we're creating we're creating access for all the
bacteria to get in and release all that carbon that's stored underneath the ground in the root
system right um because when the bacteria breaks that stuff down it releases a whole bunch of
carbon dioxide back to the environment which is the issue so the idea is that you breed plants
that are really hardy for like they have extra large root systems for example that penetrate
nice down and deep and really wide they're just larger root systems right you breed for
mass of the root system and then if you're not killing that then that carbon stays in the ground
um so the idea is that you could and also like loosens up the soil all the way down like it's
actually good for like the farmhouse the the soil health and everything builds aggregates helps
retain water stops runoff and flooding absolutely yeah all those wonderful things are also benefits
yeah so anything that you do to like you increase that process works um i was talking with a with a
i don't know if you know what phenomics is but it's like it's essentially like you can
think of genomics as the study of genes phenomics is kind of like or the genome
phenomics is like the study the study of the phenome so you look at like all the different
phenotypes that a plant can have and you can actually like you know by using cameras either
visual light cameras or infrared cameras or even uv or x-ray you can actually like look at the
plant in all these different ways and then have computer software that analyzes the photos
and measure like things like you know the distance between like internodes for example or the angle
of the stem but essentially you can use computers to analyze the plants right um and they do it in
a very standardized way that removes human error and it's automated so that's really nice
um but anyway the point is is that like i was talking to this guy and he told me that you could
use x-rays to like you know they showed me a structure in front of the plant that they're doing
and you can essentially x-ray a plant in a pot and the x-ray we will pick up like a diagram of what
the root system is and do all these calculations based on root system mass and branching and
whatever other traits that are interesting in the roots right so um you can like it's hard to look
at the root systems and plants otherwise that's exciting that's exciting it gives us a way of
like looking at plants that we can then you know take and use it for breeding decisions right so
it's pretty cool that that's that's that's very cool um is definitely one of the things that's
absolutely hard to look at you gotta dig right you gotta dig to see it when you do that you kill
the plants and you also kill some of the microbiology that's in that soil and you know
another part of it is that as you till and turn that soil the carbon itself leeches onto the oxygen
in the in the atmosphere and forms co2 uh so that process itself uh like i said plus it kills your
biology especially your fungal bodies which are the most delicate those are the first to go
which increases the bacterial load in your soil which causes imbalances and
additional uh weed pressures and pest pressures and other problems come after
i think there might have been a question in the audience uh wesley um nope and he's gone
but that's okay i just wanted to make sure we didn't miss somebody if anybody else has
questions or wants to come up also i think i think the room is going are we done almost trevor ryan
london peter i know i'm done so you all have a fantastic night i'm heading for bed
have a great one i'll talk to hopefully everybody will stop into the room on third
on this thursday as we talk about sugars and next thursday to talk about uh hot plate and
thyroid um have a great night take it easy jason good night jason
yeah unless anybody has any comments or questions on intersex plants maybe we should wrap it here
yeah wasn't this about uh intersex not not hermaphrodite but intersex we've been on a long
tangent the last like a couple hours i feel
the intersex conversation is like just in that it's like it goes on and on and on with the
plants too but i actually think it's really interesting tied back to hemp rooting because
it's such like a issue because it was intentionally bred into um genetics because of the harvest time
so it's just like to me i think it's really pretty fascinating um it kind of ties back around
in that way i feel like you gotta give one little tidbit for those that stayed to the end if anybody
makes it through trevor was mentioning there is these old studies done on one of the things that
the horticulturalist noticed was this weird sexual habit of the plant so they were interested in
intersex like you know late 1800s early 1900s you can find publications on it
and this just came to me i don't know i thought about it before but one of those studies they did
they looked at crops grown in you know the regular season say they planted in the spring harvested in
um you know the fall or whatever and then they planted another crop and grew it over the winter
and that crop had all these intersex problems and in their study they just i don't remember what
they attributed it to i think they were doing some other kind of treatment condition at the
way at the same time the whole point was this like they essentially grew this crop over the winter
in in glass houses and i don't even think they were using proper light supplement light
supplementation so of course you're going to have some degree of like intersex in the plants right
um anyway they they essentially made some conclusion that was totally baseless because
you couldn't compare the two treatment conditions right the environment was so different in each
test that it was kind of like yeah well maybe it was the environment that was different right but
anyway old research low light i think that's one of those things that i know and i've had people
historically try to say that like you know oh these certain genetics like if you have like
low light conditions and trying to say like oh it's just rotalization and it's not actually um
like it's a different form of intersex uh and i don't know i just kind of think sometimes people
like like to throw around like plant taught plant subjects and think that they know what they're
talking about but i don't um like certain genetics don't do well in low light and will
produce hermaphrodites and in that i don't know what your perception there is ryan
why i got so distracted by you saying ritalization i mean i got excited because
there's like there's another word that we use in the cannabis world that is completely meaningless
exactly that's what i'm saying right like just like oh i'm like i'm like really so that's why
it's doing that and i'm like no that's not that's not the right word like we're just throwing that
around for it's not only the right word it's not even a word right like it was somebody and then
no totally so i don't know that's kind of what i mean is like to me i'm like okay so you're just
making something up to make an excuse for the plant that your genetics aren't stable you know
like that's that's kind of to me it's one way of discovering something right like just conjuring it
out of thin air and using it as a way to explain yourself cannabis industry is really good at that
that's that's like our pro i mean i'm so tired of the hermaphrodite intersex conversation honestly
like i feel like it's just been like it's uh i mean i'm tired of it being an issue in our space
and and i hear and i missed that earlier part of the conversation and maybe you guys covered this
but i don't know ryan i would be very curious your perceptions because my understanding it was like in
the 50s and 60s that it was intentionally bred into like that because that with fiber crops
and hemp that uh the females and the males come ripe at different times so it's like your harvest
is going to be off because the males are going to be ready for harvest sooner than the females
and so they decided to breed them together to create this more amnesious crop that like would
all come um ready for harvest at the same time and so i think especially when you're breeding with
hemp genetics it's definitely like way more of an issue because it's like super it's in tons of
lines um and just becomes more of an issue and so my theory i have some like weird theories that
maybe it's like part of this because it was intentionally bred back in the 50s and 60s and
because of you know i don't know whatever sort of natural crossovers happened i don't know what
your thoughts are there well i mean i could give you some background reading to go and read it'll
blow your mind there's a guy named ivan boshka or is it b-o-c-s-a ivan i-v-a-n and um he was a
hemp researcher in hungary and he essentially ran the hemp research association in hungary or the
hemp research program and he's really an interesting guy he was like the the police would you know if
there was ever like a cannabis bust the police would bring him over to the field to tell them
that it was drug cannabis or hemp cannabis but um he did a whole bunch of work on on this stuff and
and you know creating he created what he called unisex cannabis but he did a bunch of work on
breeding different types and yeah they believed that i think it was better for the grain yield
i think part of the rationale was also that like you said the female plant in the male plant died
in the field at different times and there was concern that would be contributing to disease
to have the dead male plants in there because the way they grow you know when you're scatter
seeding hemp good luck going through it rogan the fucking males or anything like that right
or harvesting them early i mean it's just not possible like it's it's they're grown so tightly
together you can't even walk through it so they're just interspersed with males and they and the
males die after they've you know spent their spent their pollen you might say and um yeah they're
they're left in the fields while the females still have to mature and so maybe they're promoting mold
i don't know how what the natural degree is i don't know if anybody knows what the natural
degree is i mean there might be some been some populations that were
intersex or more than others um you know tie for one right
so who really knows what it was at the time or at least i don't know maybe i should say that
but anyway check out the most check out bosh's work i want to start calling it unisex cannabis
better that's like okay that feels way more like uh like inclusive i feel inclusive
i mean i've seen it's funny because i feel like maybe i did like we got off on some tangents but
it's like i have tons of photos that i've collected over the years because i'm like
field what like people could call me and they're like what is going on can you come over to my farm
and like see what's up with these genetics and so i've been called into like weird situations where
people are freaking out and don't know what to do and um you know just being in southern oregon
we've had so many issues with um uh like as it's been also called interspecies breeding which is
not accurate but people are like you know it's like this um we have a very large um you know
for a few years there there was a lot of very unstable genetics in the hemp world in southern
oregon especially and it was just wreaking havoc honestly i feel like we like bred our own varieties
of ditchweed and even now i'm like curious because there's so many if people who don't know what
happened here it's like there was you know there was a mad rush with the hemp you know kind of it
was like the gold rush or the green rush essentially and tons of people came from all over
and started growing um hemp in southern oregon and just in oregon in general and they were just
buying genetics from anybody that said they had the right genetics and i mean i've seen all sorts
of horror stories and seen plants uh show intersex in like so many different ways because it doesn't
just like present in one way or two ways um you know it's like all sorts of weird things can happen
i don't know ryan if you guys spoke about that earlier but i definitely have collected a lot of
photos over the years and i think that um you know we just had massive pollination issues we had um
i mean i've seen some awful awful things but also seen it um present differently you know it's like
there's a plants will look very different when they start to show intersex in the end of flower
versus in like uh pre flower or you know early flower i don't know did you speak to that ryan
no we didn't but there's an old um one of my old og posts i put up this picture of all these
abnormal flowers and i probably we probably should have brought that up today it's an old
book by i think his name was michael crane p-r-a-i-n-e but he um yeah he was essentially
someone that worked i think for the british military in india
you know what maybe not even it might have been done by someone and someone in india
and they made a report um they did a whole report for the government and published this report on
like the abnormal flower morphology that they found like walking through the fields in india
and so and it was all picture i mean you know it's 1800s right it's like late 1800s
so there's obviously no digital photographs it's all hand-drawn pictures right there's a
lithograph but there's a whole bunch of really abnormal versions of intersex like you're saying
and all sorts of bizarre stuff going on right so maybe go through my old ig and check out some
posts they're not even that oh my god i'm like i'm excited i'm like yeah i don't want to see it
because i'm already my experience is why i've documented it like i think for me i have my own
little weird and i i could have like i think maybe that would have been more fun to do earlier i
think we've done that in like the um oaksterdam plant talk on friday we've had you know we're
really i call it like clubhouse um clubhouse bingo so i can show like there if we all could
like show our photos and our ptr then you can kind of start to see like different people
how the plant morphology can look weird and for different people um but yeah
if you're also yeah go ahead sorry i just want to say if you're looking on my ig it's like a white
paper with like some hand-drawn um they're not really cartoons but they're hand-drawn
diagrams of different canvas flower morphologies and it's really quite uh quite interesting
did you guys speak to like oh go ahead anthony
either
your mic your mic's messy buddy i'm barely hearing you
uh-oh come back mr t yeah mr toad you were you were you were uh going in the black hole
that's all right i'm having issues with my microphone guys it's okay
we can hear you we hear you loud and cloud yeah yeah you sound great
you sounded good anthony if you want to come back um but brian i'm just curious too did you
guys speak i mean i'm sure i probably missed like you guys going into your deep dive at the beginning
earlier but um did you speak to the you know the because i feel like sometimes people call um
and maybe you'll school me probably because you know it's like there's so many different names i've
heard for the pollen donors like when you are doing feminization um and i've heard people refer
to those as hermaphrodite plants or intersex plants and it's kind of like they're their own
unique um and that's why i like to call them pollen donors because they just i mean people
call them oh my god there's a lot of funny names for them actually but i'm just curious like what
what is the correct name because to me like i don't i mean i guess that maybe like and also
genetically like what is actually happening there yeah it's interesting
a couple of funny things there i think one is that i call them pollen donors like you do i
think that's the best way to describe them i mean to me it's intersex
like intersex is a phenotype right and
i can understand why they call them intersex but like i kind of think of the intersex as both
a phenotype and a genotype right to me if the plant is female and i can force it to produce
male flowers by spraying it with an exogenous chemical that it's never going to come into
contact with a nature that's not an intersex plant right it's still a female plant it's
genetically female and so when i take a genetically female plant and i reverse it i call it a donor
like you do um the other little weird thing i wanted to say is i find the word feminized so
dumb like it's like even like what you said like oh in the feminization process if anything it's a
masculinization process right like we're do something doing something to the plant that
makes it produce male flowers that's masculinization by definition right so you
masculinize something produce seeds that are feminized again like feminized is an english word
that was coined by a non-native english speaker for marketing purposes so
i don't really like the term feminized i've actually never thought about it like that
me either that's what i was thinking because we we actually have some funny nicknames i mean it's
just like and some of them are kind of like it may be inappropriate but like for the like for the
like the the she males and stuff like we would call them like i mean and if it maybe it's gender
inclusive but like we would call those plants like very interesting things but it's true like
the pollen donors you are you're like you're masculine you're you're transitioning it you know
yeah that's the first time i've ever thought about that and it's a super good point that
you're making feminized seeds by masculinizing a plant and yeah calling it a hermaphrodite or
intersex it's like when you're forcing it to do that and uh i'm pretty sure every single plant
will respond to an sts treatment i'm not certain but vast vast majority are going to respond to it
then everything would be technically inner or have that intersex trait to it so yeah it's
definitely on a league of its own and it makes sense to have a term specifically for that process
yeah i don't know i just i just think that i hate to be the word nazi that's like regulating
no you are the word nazi i know i know you're the authority on it we need you okay wait
but here's a couple of things is i actually like because i'm obviously i'm a woman so like
i like the term feminized and i have it appeals to me but now i have to really like rethink
because it's true it's like you're not i'm not feminizing like i'm taking it's true i'm taking
a female plant and you're masculine i think it which is just really funny to think about it like
but also i think i guess point being it really pisses me off when people call them hermene
because i'm like well actually no it's not a hermene plant like and then they're like oh
you're just you're making them hermes and i'm like no actually it's not only that it's also
a bird totally different but it's also clearly you've never seen it right you also clearly
they've never seen it it looks totally so i just ptr'd for i just want to showcase like
there are so it's so different and i'm curious what like trevor or anthony or ryan like
those different phases so like some but also like what causes a plant to um go intersects at a
different time and i've heard all these interesting theories that like when plants are in full flower
because we do have these you know we when we are doing production we're doing female production
and that there's this pressure on the plants to self replicate and that some people really have
this theory that um you know it's that one female that's like well you know you're like the end of
a run and all of a sudden there's like one female that's like actually i think i'm gonna spread some
pollen and it's you know that there's this collective frequency of it's just like the
survival impulse in the plant and so it's a very interesting and i've heard people say oh well if
there there's all these misnomers in the cannabis space about like oh well a lot of the times
hermaphrodite pollen is sterile so you don't have to worry about i've heard this with nonsense auto
breeders for years where they're like oh it does produce male flowers but those are sterile and
it's like well how do you know did you look at that pollen under like my did you try to use it
you know i'm like there's gonna be seeds how so how can you say that and i think that maybe it's
like clarifying some of like the urban myths in the cannabis industry um maybe is a important
because like the itis ptrd that's like a close-up of a um like bananas at the very end you know and
why did they do it you know it's like that genetic had never done that before it's like all of a
sudden just decided yeah well again you know i we did say i did say this a little bit earlier but
like you know look we we know that altering ethylene in the plant causes doing ethylene
blockade with sbs right with silver blocks the ethylene receptor when we do ethylene blockade
we get intersex issues they're not intersex issues we get transitioning of sex of sex right i mean
the the phenotypic expression of sex we also know that like when plants ripen and fruits ripen
they're usually being ripened by ethylene or changes in ethylene right so to me knowing those
two facts it's not a stretch to say like oh yeah maybe at the end of a life cycle of a plant
that there's ethylene changes and those ethylene changes are actually one of the things that's
responsible for why things are ripening up in the plant as they do right that's why we wait to
you know week eight nine ten or whatever the given cultivar is and wait for that those pistols to
start dying back um yeah i tend not to again i think and we hear it all the time that this is
like the plant making a last-ditch effort to fertilize itself like really when most plants
are fertilized or throwing pollen their male flowers are or their female flowers are usually
like spent right like think about it it takes usually what four weeks for a seed to be made so
the plant pops a pollen like when the rest of the a male answer when the rest of the pistols are
already withered it's not really trying to make get like one last ditch effort to make seed maybe
it's like just an extra evolutionary advantage thing that like hey the one that did that it had
an opportunity to pollinate like a a plant elsewhere that did still have viable pistols
right i don't know i i don't know i don't know i again all right right i make a good point dude
i just feel like what if they're going to pollinate it's i just i just feel like it's
i feel like it's anthropomorphizing the plant again right and it's like well we love to do
that you know how the cannabis industry loves to do that i mean it's kind of the game i i really
think that's a great point because honestly i think that i think it's it's all i think that
maybe we need to do like a myth busters series with maybe peter can we do like a future canvas
project like myth busters in the cannabis industry because they're all like these urban legends and
myths and bro science and things and i think that we've gotten far enough down the rabbit
hole that we really can call out a bunch of things that are just bullshit and um i think that ryan is
you know you actually just really helped me because it's like people talk about how you can
bring a certain cultivar or like you know especially with a lot of these hype genetics
is like you can grow it in one way and it won't harm me but then you put it in another environment
and it does and i had never thought about it from the ethylene because you know how many people
don't even know that the reason why you need to cure burp cannabis properly like well you're like
that it produces ethylene so many people don't even understand if the plant actually produces
ethylene in post-production and that's what causes um degradation i'm like if you got bananas
on the counter they're turning brown because they produce ethylene you know like it's it's literally
so simple this is one thing that i did say earlier you might have missed but i don't know if you were
there or not but you know and i'll just reiterate the point again there's only five hormones in
plants five major hormones and plants call it that really regulate the whole dance of life
right um we know that blockading one of those pathways the ethylene pathway results in
intercept we know we can we can flip female plants male male plants female just by either putting
ethylene on or blocking ethylene right but we can also if you take gibberellic acid and you spray it
on plants that like essentially mimics gibberellins right your plants stretch out like crazy but
they'll also go intersex right and so it's like two out of the five hormones two two out of the
five hormone pathways that are responsible for the entire dance of life if we play with either of them
independently they both make intersex i mean that we that leaves a lot of room for environmental
interplay on a whole bunch of different factors right because obviously like you know these plant
these hormones they they are like they do fluctuate in response to the environment right
and certain things have happened in the environment so i really don't think that it's so far off
and you know you think about it from the cannabis plant's point of view again now i'm
avidly glorifying the plant but from the from the cannabis plant's point of view
why does it care if it produces a male flower right like it's all it is doing is like that's
a potential strategy that might add what we what darwin called fitness meaning fecundity right like
fitness meaning the ability to leave offspring so like if if you're if if also sprouting a male
flower at the end of flowering makes that plant more fit then it's selected for positively
positively usually right so i don't know okay does that work now
london london's mic work does decker christ's mic work
oh my god i've been trying to chime in for like an hour now i've been like what the
fuck is going on i can't chime in and i finally got it fucking working again
hey so yes mistbusters thing big time i want to do that please shoot me a message on the back and we
will we will organize that because we should if we can involve jettisoning a plant with a small
catapult to prove something at some point in some way and we can do it on video i think that
would be pretty entertaining as well but we don't have to do that but i think that would be fun i'm
gonna make a list i'm gonna make a list i'm gonna start making a list of things we need to like
myth bust and bro science like i just ptr again for a different really quick i just ptr it again
for a different because i'm like trying to go through and find all these different representations
of like i've because i've seen literally so many it just do it so many different ways and so many
different types of genetics and i wish i had more photos of like the weird auto flower things because
holy cow they've done some weird ass stuff but like that's a different one right yeah i've i've
did a ptr as well um of something that was just starting starting to go into the flowering stage
that's pretty interesting yeah i have another one i was trying to find where it's like a
very weird thing there's like there's either it's like a cluster of flowers on the stem and i have
a few where it's like directly on the other side there's and it's a lot of the time in cree flower
you'll see like a cluster of flowers on the one side and then a cluster a cluster of male flowers
and a cluster of female flowers and then other times it's just one single male flower
which i just don't really understand why the rhyme or reason with how the plants
yeah the auto flower ones they're ugly when they do it i will just say that much
yeah it's interesting i just had a few uh kind of a new intersex look that i got to see
um a couple weeks ago where it looked like um it looked like a bunch of stamina flowers but there
was like you know five or like a cluster of them but they all had stigmas popping out of them and
then on the opposite side the opposite node just had like a stamina looking flower which i'd never
seen anything like that before you know i gotta make one more point uh i'm just on the whole
terminology thing i know i am the word nazi but really i'm just trying to point out stupid stuff
that we do in the cannabis industry right and and explain like why it really in those cases like
even using the word strain like really stops people from being able to understand like the
plant variety registration system right because it's like they can't wrap their head around the
differences between the different types of registrations because everything's just the type
so anyway i made a uh you know what maybe i'll send it to you by instagram but i made like a flow
chart essentially trying to explain the difference between strain cultivar and variety uh so maybe
i'll shoot it over to you before i make it public because i kind of want to get someone's feedback on
it right to see how digestible it is i'm trying to really like simplify this whole thing down
as much as possible so that you don't have to have these big long conversations
right about why strain is wrong i thought it was strand of our i got a great clip of
of evia that ends with evian calling you a nazi just got that so you guys have that to look forward
to in the morning it's a great clip i don't actually like that word i don't use that word
i actually think it's like somebody has to be like the you know i think that we're i think we
what's the right the nice way to put it is like we just stickler we all need to speak the same
language so that we can have more impact um because if we're like united in the way that
we speak especially when you start to look like you know you're trying to impact legislation and
things it's like we and you know we're really talking about the future of how we're actually
going to help to guide how these rules i think it's so important that we're all using the same
like nomenclature or there's all different terms for it but i just think that somebody really has
to and i remember when we used to get teased for saying cultivar like three years ago and now i'm
so happy that more people are saying it you talk about mushrooms you can call them strange all day
right i mean so yeah operational definitions are pretty important when you're trying to
communicate a complex idea um just to start everyone off with the same definition it's
something that most fields of science and studies will will make sure that everyone
knows the objective operational definition of the terms and we actually talked about making a lexicon
a couple years ago like i think maybe it was like last year we were like okay we need to like
all circle the wagons and be like what's our actual lexicon because if we're all going to try
to like lobby for federal legalization or whatever it is we want to do and everybody's saying
something different we're gonna sound like a bunch of idiots so honestly i think that you know i'm
stoked um but i'm going back to plants also london run you know what i like to do when someone says
strange to me and it's just a couple of like a couple of us so i actually really want them to
think about it they'll use the word strain and i'll say define strain right it's like tell me
what a strain is and nobody can do it right because they don't know what it is they don't
they just know that like blue dream is a strain og is a strain cookies is a strain but they can't
define what a strain is right and and technically like really what a strain is what the
biological definition of the strain is is like um a biological type that can be described
and when that type reproduces like goes from generation to generation either usually through
cloning it's always through cloning because it's for bacteria and viruses that type reappears okay
and that's why cannabis doesn't have strains because if you take a plant and you reproduce it
like sexually right which is how cannabis reproduces it that type doesn't come back
right and therefore it's not a strain like none of the stuff that we have are strains they don't
qualify as strains they're not like that's not the right word to use so cultivars is the word
for that type of organism right it's i i don't it's i you know yeah maybe it's just because i i
that's what that's my little area of the world that i think about like way too much but it's like
you know it's i just find it funny when people don't even they use a word that they can't even
define right and it's a word that they obviously think that they really understand and especially
in the cannabis community i mean look at how many people just love cannabis right like everybody
that's really into the into the the industry and into the community i mean they do it because it's
something that they're passionate about so i just kind of find it funny that like
amongst most of those people they don't even really understand the words to describe it or
even that like you know when you breed cannabis to itself this type that we describe it just it
does it disappears right it doesn't come back through breeding unless you really you know take
all the work to make sure that it does and unfortunately that doesn't really happen in
this industry so i don't know maybe i'm way over way up taking it way too seriously but you know
it's like johnny said operational definitions and everybody gets on board and then we can all
communicate very easily and i think that we'd honestly move a lot faster forward if we're all
speaking the same language but instead everybody's just running around talking about terps right
so i've also expanded my definition of terps terps is a new word for me that doesn't mean terpenes
it means terpenes and all non-terpene volatile molecules that's my new definition for the word
air quotes can you write it out and put it in the operational
it's again it's like another word that the community uses and it's like
when you you know when you open a jar you know when you open a jar what some cool guy opens a
jar of weed he smells i smell those terms it's like well you're not only smelling your terp the
terps you're also smelling the tiles like you know what i mean esters and alcohols and all these
other things that are in the plant right aldehydes so i was like if we're going to use the word terps
which isn't really a word right we're going to define it and let's define it as what you're
actually smelling so maybe again that's stupid but it's amusing to me well until we get the
test to like actually showcase those things i think it's going to be harder for people to understand
because it's like we're still i don't know just that whole post prohibition era vibe like we're
still kind of stuck in there and i'm just excited that people are actually testing terpenes on
things at this point so remember you know a few years ago it was just like oh my god you guys
like actually test for terpenes um and i i'm super curious i still like so want to know what um what
else is going on in the plant but it's just having access to testing at this point so i think that's
a really good point um yeah i'd like to see yeah can i just respond to that for a quick second like
a quick interjection they i always go into a lab and if they say yeah we test for terpenes i say
is that all you test for right like it's disappointing when they only test for terps
it used to be exciting but i'm kind of past that it's like what other volatiles do you test for
right it's like oh why don't you test for all these other things oh we don't know what those are
it's like damn we're getting there i i asked a couple of labs i've worked with for years i was
like hey i want to i want to be able to test for like the fritillin and efritillin i want i want to
see what's happening you know i want to know and no but no lab could do it when i was asking and
now it's like a thing so it's you know i've asked same thing with hop slate and violet i'm like well
there's nowhere to test locally we have to like send our samples out so i talked to my friend
to own the lab that's like local to our community and next thing you know like it's available so
that was like because i pushed for what i wanted and i happen to know the owner so i think we have
to ask for what we want and um and eventually we'll get it yeah i just have a hard time going
to these labs and having them you know i know what it costs to run a lab test right so when i see like
someone says oh yeah it's a test it's 300 or 250 or whatever and i know the actual margins involved
it's like and i have to teach you how to fucking you to find all these chemicals that you don't
that i need you to find for me that you don't even know how to look for right it's like it's really
it's like you know it's like you should be giving me tests for free for like being a consultant for
you and showing you how to actually set up a fucking lab business that's looking for the right
stuff thanks for the reminder ryan i'm gonna actually be like hey by the way do you remember
when i'm the one who told you that you needed to get that yeah yeah actually good point um
really quick just on the flower i would just be curious um if anybody i want to see the i might
have to look up the um anomalies there but like is there let's just say is there like a standard
definition as far as that goes for like intersex flowers like is there like a way that intersex
flowers are supposed to show up is there like a traditional like this is actually what intersex
is supposed to look like in the cannabis plant because i'd be curious um no it's not like that
like intersex is a condition right so it's a phenotype and then the next step would be to put
like a scale to that phenotype right so you'd measure it in prevalence and this is kind of one
of the things that i believe and michelle foe did in one of her papers is how like okay this is one
of the other things we talked about earlier like you can have monogenic traits traits in a plant
that are controlled by one gene or one spot on a chromosome or you can have polygenic traits
which are like so monogenic traits is just two genes interacting together okay polygenic traits
are more than one gene i.e like if you had two genes interacting together there's four possible
alleles in that individual okay and those types of interactions are way more complicated it's like
essentially it appears like um what's it called like a like a dihybrid cross i don't know if you
know what a dihybrid cross is and it's like a two trait bonnet square okay so traits that are
polygenic they're much more complicated and they and that's typically how you have variation in a
population so when you have like a trait that varies like for example height height is a good
one to look at so let's consider humans height versus a trait like eye color eye color is there's
discrete categories okay there's green there's brown there's blue and maybe there's like some
very small low percentage like yellow you know what i mean or red or some kind of really bizarre
weird color those are categories of types but there can only be four types but if you look at
the human population as a whole globally we've got people that are like two feet tall i'm talking
about fully matured people so we've got people that are like two feet tall like in the case of
like progeria for example or you got like your crazy tall basketball player guy right at like
seven almost eight feet tall but within that range in between those two extreme ends of the spectrum
there is every single possibility right we're probably millimeter by millimeter like if you
were to go through the human population as a whole i'm sure you could find millimeter by
millimeter the entire gradient of two feet to eight feet right with most of us falling between
say four and six okay so that's called that type that type of range is not controlled by one gene
that type of trait i.e height is really like many different genes that all have a small effect
but additive up together they make what we call a polygenic trait or a qualitative trait
sorry quantitative quantitative trait right so blue eyes brown eye blue eyes brown eyes green eyes
those traits vary in quality right they they change in a quality of a type
quantitative traits like potency or height in humans or heightened plants those are also like
quantitative traits and quantitative traits that show like variation and not discrete categories
they're typically polygenic traits that are results of like many many genes acting together
in an additive manner was that like out of nowhere anyway the point maybe i didn't tie
that back to intersex intersex plants occur on that spectrum right so you can have like one male
totally female plant with one male flower technically that's intersex it's between sexes
right way at the other end of the spectrum you've got the entire male plant that's got one pistol on
it also intersex right but you'll find an entire gradient of different types of individuals from
like half and half to a bunch of females on either male females on male flowers vice versa
like that kind of thing so i hope that was relevant and not rambling no that's great that
actually helps a lot to like visualize it you know it's like the sometimes i wish when you're speaking
we could have like a you know have like the the chart so you could actually really like look at
it in comparison to that because it is helpful it's helpful to help visualize um the differences
and i think that we're all learning more and more about like the genetic piece and like what
that actually looks like i'd be curious if you guys tied it back to breeding earlier um as well
you know and just as as far as like what are it because it's it's i think also it's very important
i want to say i say i joke that i'm so tired of this conversation because it really it's just it's
it's but it's also part of a conversation you know it's something that we deal with in a very regular
like i dealt with this earlier today you know and it's like when you're you know when you're
doing selection um then you're going to end up dealing with this at the end of the day it's just
one of those things and i would be very curious um you know how we refine that um within the
breeding world without having to use tons of really expensive tests and i think it's the major issue
of people just feeding things through their breeding process and not doing a lot of trials
or really like working the lines for quite long enough and testing it in a more wide variety of
ways and the ethylene point that you made makes a ton of sense actually because i'm thinking about
like there's always like certain areas of like a greenhouse or a certain maybe where the airflow
is not quite as good like i'm like oh yeah there's like spots and same with like certain
facilities i'm like why did this one facility have issues in this one room you know i went to a
friend's facility today and there's just always issues it doesn't matter what the genetics are
in this one room and then i'm like okay well is it something with the environmental that there's a
you know perhaps the buildup of ethylene in an area and maybe that is causing the plants
so ryan you made my i'd never thought about it like that and it actually because i'm always
thinking it's got to be something environmental sometimes that triggers the plants because how
come you can grow something multiple times and it doesn't show intersex trait but then
something's off and it does or there's some things that just no matter what you do they just
show that and you know really temperamental and you look at it wrong and it's going to show
some sort of intersex so i'm just curious you know how to give back those tools to breeders so
it's less of a major issue within the um within this space because it really is a major issue
yeah on the room thing i mean one thing that really does it is red light so a lot of times
you get like an electrician come in and hang a piece of equipment that has red light on it
right and that can be enough to trigger it but it could be anything like you said and i think that
there there are there are all of these different environmental triggers that are triggering each
of those independent genetic factors that all together you know essentially set that a threshold
for how like likely a plant is to throw usually a male flower and i think that's the one that we
also see most of the time um rather than males with female flowers mostly because most people
aren't looking at male plants right so you know i always hear people say oh i've got a plant it's a
male plant these resins like yeah well you know you probably haven't seen very very many male
plants if you think that a resinous plant is interesting because there's a lot of resonance
metals right um but yeah intersex i think is one of those ways and this i got to give this back
credit to i don't know if trevor's still on but um a grower breeder named hyde he bred an auto
flowering weird leaf shaped line called the subterfuge and he also sells one of these
reversal sprays but he actually pointed that out to me like maybe 20 years ago
breeding with females might actually be the best way to remove intersex from female plants
right and the reasoning is that when you're choosing when you're evaluating a characteristic
that is so important i.e being as unlikely as possible
a plant like for a female plant to produce male flowers
under natural conditions every female plant i can take and make it produce male flowers
well i'm convinced that i can maybe you have somebody has a plant that i can't do it on but
like i'd be surprised if that were the case the reason is the genes for male flower the male
flowers are not on the y chromosome they're either on the x chromosome or the autosomes
and i'm not sure which but that's probably going to be elucidated relatively soon um
and we know this because you can take female plants that don't have y chromosomes and make
them produce male flowers when you spray ethylene on it so the ethylene is only turning a gene on or
off but that gene has to can't be on the y chromosome because females don't have it so
we can rule out the y chromosome as that place for that gene right what we can't real what we
when we're using male plants though the male plant doesn't express the phenotype that we're
looking for which is how often do male flowers occur on female plants right it's a male plant
it's making male stamina clusters not pistolette clusters so it's actually a different trait right
and so when you're using a male and and trying to trying to identify whether you have a plant that
has genes for call it resistance to intersexuality right or a lack of susceptibility genes whichever
it ends up being that's where i kind of lost my place here if you if you've got those
no we haven't won those moments
i've lost it i'm sorry i gotta take a moment
oh i have i've been doing dabs when i turn off my mic and i'm um not with it what was i saying anyone
you were talking about turning off the uh oh right yeah so anyway
by using males you're not actually able to evaluate that trait right again the only plants
that really produce this condition that we can look at and observe is females right and so if
you're breeding two females together you can actually evaluate whether those you can actually
evaluate whether those plants are resistant to becoming intersex if you're looking at male plants
you you have no idea right and so this tenant like you know the idea was always oh don't use
feminized breeding they're going to make everything intersex right they're going to
make everything into hermaphrodite but truly by only using only females and then selecting the
plants that are the most resistant to ever you know they never produce a female or a male flower
under natural grow room conditions those are the plants that you want to use as breeding candidates
right and if you if you breed only with those breeding candidates i think that that's going to
be the way to really be able to push out intersex from from plants or you know it it's probably
going to be a better strategy than using males put it that way sorry for the brain fart that was
awesome ryan actually even with your your really subway pause and i think that you i mean you the
fact that you could just rattle that stuff off while you're doing a ton of jobs needs to be
really commended because it's great it's great information and i think it's also like it's
important that uh you know i think people need to realize too it's like you either have to go to like
a lot of school to understand some of these things and like really deepen your education
and a lot of this stuff isn't necessarily stuff that you can't um it takes a lot of effort to
really figure that out and the community needs that information so important because it really
is a major issue i mean i'm hoping that people can take some of that information and start to
make moves to help uh help to stabilize the the general population of what we're dealing with
here and maybe it's just part of what maybe we're always gonna have that intersex trait
as just something that happens within these plants i don't know i personally love male flowers and
and i actually miss having um more males like actual male plants um at times because there
just is something uh i don't know i feel like they're highly underrated and that there's something
really special um and i think there's some special thing with them um like a certain thing is there
like a compound or something within the male flowers i'm trying to remember it's actually
gonna bug me i'm just like i can't remember what it is about the male flowers and the pollen that
is is it kempro might be it's something unique to the male flowers but obviously the feminized
flowers you don't want to like you know it's not something that you could imbibe um there's like a
tea or something it's actually maybe water i don't know i'm not to really remember that it was a few
years ago i kind of went down like a male flower but they're really they're really magical they're
super beautiful it's a little bit depressing that they're um not as honored as they are
i've done some work on making all male lines as well so yeah it's uh i mean they're difficult to
make all male but it's it's there's definitely a use for them right like for example way way back
in time i thought if i could develop an all male line then i could sell it to the police as like
plant this all over your city right and tell them that it's gonna you know it's gonna essentially
ruin all the cannabis growers and then you sell the cannabis growers or just give it away for free
a sterile line right and so essentially you're draining the police budget by having them buy this
you know the seed that's supposed to pollinate all the cannabis growers but they're all growing
sterile hemp varieties so it doesn't work um anyway that was like a dream of that at one time
i thought would have been funny um but there's also uses for it like just in straight agriculture
like you know like we were talking about earlier you've got male flowers taking up half the field
in a hemp crop if you're trying to produce hemp for seed right it would be a lot more efficient
if you could plant a whole block of of you know all female seed and then run strips of male plants
in between those blocks right and be able to plant it from seed so like say eight rows of
females and then one row of males eight rows of females one row of males eight rows of females
one row of males right and then when the when the males had done their thing you come all in and
tractor out the males and then you're left with only females
and you'd probably have i i figured that you'd have a higher seed set
right than those intermix fields so
maybe there's utility who knows i would just like to speak to the natural cultivation of
cannabis and the possible reasonings for the hermaphroditization and the late stages of some
of the earlier flowering girls i'm standing in a field here with 200 cannabis plants and
sometimes we have volunteers speaking to what jason was saying about the no-till method obviously in
nature the no-till method would say that seasonally with the moon the volunteer cannabis seeds from
last season pop up so they might be the young juveniles that get pregnant by the elders
the seasonal elders so if you had some early season mid season and late season plants or some
60 day 90 day 120 day plants and then the elders could possibly be pregnanting the youngens
and that way keeping their family collective or their field of variants cultivars chemo bars
whatever the gender specific names are and if anybody can um from canadary if anybody from
canadary can uh call in jordan peterson maybe he'll be able to help us out with the uh
hermaphroditism and cannabis and the correct nameage of male female bothies he she's shims
um i sent through to london a picture of one of our females that has a nasty little cluster
of um boy i forget the terminology that ryan said for the uh plant the male cluster of flowers but
yeah one little she's a gorgeous looking plant other than the little cluster um so yeah speaking
to that thank you ryan thank you london thank you evian thank you peter thank everybody else from the
future uh yeah and jason's still here it's um actually seven o'clock in the evening on the
first of february so if you guys want to think that it's late it's actually like your future future
always good good to get a report from the other side of the world seriously i'm like ah new zealand
um brian you made me think of a couple things too and now i'm like i'm trying to gather my
question i appreciate the um the global check-in and and shims is a is a good one also i will say
i think that might be that scientific ryan can we use that um i don't know but um i had like a
question about um i'm gonna have to ponder for a second but i had a good one um tying back to like
the breeding piece give me a moment and ponder you know again i'm not trying to be a word to
but i remember i was having a conversation about gender at someone at some point in time when i
thought to myself you know what i really need to go and look up the definition of the word gender
because maybe i'm just assuming that i know what the definition is and i think that like you know
i i didn't have it right put it that way um so you know again i'm not trying to be a dick about
terminology but it's like i think just in order to understand some of these concepts or more deeper
concepts it is good to have like an understanding of what the words that we're using mean right
because words do have meaning that are quite specific and oftentimes you have multiple words
that like to layman they all mean the same thing but if you really know what you're talking about
they're you know they're very different words that each have specific meaning right um so if
you're trying to communicate with someone at like a an intricate level and exchange a lot of knowledge
like it's better to use the proper terms well as an educate as educators and like this is like a
public facing uh forum so i think that using uh the correct nomenclature looks con whatever and
they like sweat johnny said earlier but i don't remember operational wingo i don't think that's
what you said but uh i i just want to say i actually thought because i'm i'm trying to figure
out like because it's not just the intersex thing is not just like oh it's something that happens
with plants of course this is like a this is something that is happening with plants but i
feel like it's a problem that gets perpetuated within the industry and even today i had a convert
i mean it just is so funny to me how conversations come around because somebody's like oh yeah
i've got like you know i smoke a lot of weed so i got a lot of seeds i'm like well do you
so you know it's just funny to me because i realize like i'm thinking about the ethylene
thing now and then i'm also thinking about like this culture of like popping bag seeds and that
people you know generally when you have i mean not i'm not to say that magical things have not
come out of people's bag seed okay so i don't want to like get in trouble for saying that but
because of course there are unicorns everywhere sure i've popped bag seed i'm guilty of it you
know i'm sure we all have but at the end of the day is like is that that's probably coming from
either an intersex plant or something went wrong at some point you know generally i doubt it's
coming from like you know occasionally i'm sure come from rogue male or whatever but chances are
that it actually came i mean because it's also true that like randomly you will have um
this is very rare anymore that people are actually like running selection with male female in along
with production lines so i just i don't know orion i'd be curious if you kind of think that
that is also like perpetuating this intersex thing um throughout the space or just it's another
way nine times out of ten if somebody's gonna pop seeds that they just found in bag of weed
that those are there because that something in that production
when intersects is my concept and that's just gonna keep going so i don't know thoughts
i still see people yeah like i mean randomly
you know randomly accepting seeds from some dude that may that or some lady or whatever that made
seeds and it's like her first time growing weed and it's like she's passing them out like blue
dream you know i got these seeds blue dream and i made seeds from them and so it's blue dream right
and listen not only it's it's bad enough like the whole users do do that kind of stuff there's
professional seed companies that do that kind of stuff right so like the the cannabis seed
industry is a fucking joke it's an absolute fucking joke um sorry to the participants i'm a
participant but i mean fuck if we can't admit that then jesus christ where the hell are we
like and i'm sorry to cut so much about it but it really this is like something that's pissed me off
for the longest time i put a lot of energy and education and like time and research dollars and
like effort into producing our seeds and your average um you're at your average home consumer
can't even recognize that they that that that has a value right they're more interested in
buying seeds with fancy color coding on them or whatever the stupid selling thing is for the day
most people are when i see people buying seeds online that are like in the cannabis community
i know that they're in the cannabis community and the choices that they make it's like i'm shocked
at what people are buying right and what decision processes they use to make decisions or even
trying to producing that they're you know they're they're seeds for their grow and like they're
willing to risk it all on some amateur seeds from across the country like it's it blows me away
you know i i maybe i take such a genetic thing too seriously but like you know you can
you can grow b seeds and at the best you're gonna even if you do everything right you're
gonna get like b quality crop right i don't know i just don't and and given the intersex thing
as well i just i don't i don't understand why people don't really invest in proper cannabis
seeds but that's just me i think it's maybe because people don't understand i think that's
kind of the stance like that's what i think i was going with that it's like it's like generally
people don't understand like they just think like oh cool there's some seeds in the bag but they
don't really understand how they got there yeah well it's a strain right if i buy something
that are named blue dream maybe they must be blue dream right it's the assumant you know like
if you're buying like black russian tomato seeds or like beefsteak tomato seeds or
whatever plant variety like you can be pretty damn confident that what you're buying is actually what
it is in the cannabis industry that ain't even close to reality well i know that what i have
seen in the cannabis industry is that nobody and when i say nobody i mean absolutely nobody
really gives you that much information on the pedigree of the stuff that they're working you
know um just like you were saying i i think that i would actually like to see seeds marketed with
the the same genetic line that you would get for to buy like a a plant-based product and
you know the parental units going back a certain amount of generations and i think that you know
for me i would almost like to see stuff like that before someone could actually go to the market and
say hey you know this is whatever so that way it actually gives a little bit of credit but at the
same time obviously we don't have a methodology to be able to do that effectively um you know i
know that for me i think that you know there are entities out there like seed finder i guess like
leafly as much as i don't really care for it but you know that they try to give information but
not to the extent that what i'm looking for as a consumer um and also someone that that makes
seeds myself yeah see i mean i've touched on this with trevor a little bit before i don't
personally value pedigree breeding i think pedigree breeding is the wrong way to breed cannabis
um it makes a little more sense with dogs and horses because a given horse is not going to
have a thousand individuals to choose from okay so you know what what you're doing when you're
doing when you're using pedigree breeding which is really what they use in order versus you're saying
the father of this horse or the mother of this horse was a champion therefore the child will be
a champion okay and that's a really big bad assumption to make with cannabis because
cannabis does have thousands of offspring okay and we know that those thousands of offspring are
all very different from the parent plants because cannabis breeds more like humans than it does like
tomatoes for example okay so you can out of a thousand plants 500 of those plants call it 499
are going to be below average 500 the other 499 like you know so individuals 0 to 499 are below
the average right individuals 501 to a thousand or above average right just kind of think of it
that way you got a 50 50 shot shot at hitting the wrong one or a plant that's for an animal that is
or a plant that is below average right whereas like with horses you might only have like three
or four or maybe you know maybe if you're set up there if the champion are selling sperm maybe
there's 10 or 15 offspring of this individual right so it's it's like it's better to in that
strategy it's probably better to you know roll the dice when it's when the odds are one in seven
but it's like when you're looking for the top 10 percent of a plant or even top five percent of
a plant out of a thousand like that's 50 individuals out of a thousand right like you're really only
selecting the cream of the crop so you know like planning on an individual just become from because
they came from a good parent i don't think that that's a good strategy right and and so when i
look at seeds maybe maybe i'm the one that's out of touch you know maybe i am out of touch with i
think i clearly am out of touch with the seed market but like for me i wouldn't really care
what the parents were i want to know what the what the generation i'm buying is right like i'd rather
have descriptors on these plants are going to be these terpene profiles these growing metrics these
characteristics this can have my profile those are the statistics to me that matter right so well i
definitely see what you're saying but i also look at it from the standpoint that just because you have
a good pedigree does not mean that just like you were saying you don't have a winner just because
and you see this all the time and you know we'll use people then you know i'm just i know that you
were using you know horse breeding and dog breeding but even if you look at people you know
how many times have you seen completely beautiful mothers and fathers have a you know and i apologize
please don't even take offense to this but a really ugly ass kid um you know and then you see
absolutely you know homely looking that have a supermodel uh child i mean you know but at the
same time it's just the potential and the possibility of what the genetic makeup is
potentially in that person obviously you have to go through the selection process obviously you
still have to do the work with it that nothing is given in cannabis that's 100 so but at the same
time it goes back to the same conversation that i know that i've had before that if you look at
u.s cannabis it's still made up of 25 to 30 cultivars so there's still those building block
cultivars that everybody is ultimately trying to in my mind kind of go back to be able to bring
things that they're either romanticizing about or to make things that are brand new and unique by
things that were essentially really good um you know most of the time i don't hear very often
of you know the next best thing being from two absolute garbage um parental stocks i mean that
usually something was good that was looked upon to even make that selection to begin with
so i definitely see where you're coming from but i also you know i'm gonna have to say that you know
i personally respectfully disagree from that standpoint but at the same time you know i'm
not anywhere close to where you are as a breeder um i like being on this because it puts things in
different perspectives for me but the only thing that i can actually speak to is what i have
personally witnessed and what my results are whenever i will apply so well and i listen i
hear you dude and like i said like i'm clearly out of touch with the marketplace because i think the
market agrees with you so um yeah like that's definitely the way we're doing thing and everybody
seems to want those seeds right like those seeds are the seeds that are selling so um yeah
yeah i mean and listen i also think that those you know when i was working down cali i'd actually
had access to all those plants as well um and you know there's there's some interesting stuff in them
but to a certain point like we're just kind of like moving around the chairs on the deck of the
titanic you know what i mean like we're really just taking the same things and reshuffling it
and reshuffling it in a different way um we're not really going to find too too much new stuff
just doing it that way it's very unfortunate that there's not you know that u.s breeding you know
for me is great and extremely terrible at the same time and it's the reason why you know at a very
early age in my life i understood the importance of being able to source genetics that were you
know more indigenous to remote areas of the world than you know what was going on in humboldt or
you know kentucky tennessee area or just you know the west coast and then the middle of the states
that was growing the largest amount of illegal cannabis but at the same time you know i have
genetics from when cannabis was still very much based on an export level where you know different
times of the year you would get different kinds of cannabis based upon when people were harvesting
but you know it's still very unique that the fact of the matter is that we're still you know looking
at things from a standpoint that almost everything you know has those still those very few
cultivars in it and you know i want more diversity myself but at the same time
you know it's getting harder and harder to be able to find true f1s and i know that you know i
just kind of have my head in the sand with my own stuff and it's the reason why i very seldomly take
on other years because i don't have you know really for me enough time to be able to work through all
the stuff that i have but yet you know i i don't know about the rest of the people on the panel
here but i'm still very much an addict when it comes to trying to obtain seeds and you know my
my wife has finally cut me off and said hey you have a budget to what you can spend on genetics
because you know if i had my way if i was on the internet for an hour every single day you know i'd
find 10 different things that i would be interested in playing with even though i'm so backed up that
you know it's going to be you know 15 20 years after i retire before i would realistically
even be able to pop those as a seed addict myself i i can't help but empathize with you
and understand your problems very well i mean it's like i've got a list of seeds to crack
that are you know it's way longer than reasonable and it's certainly longer than i'll ever get
through in my lifetime and i know that every time i pop those seeds and find interesting plants
that i make new seeds that also have to be inserted in some like level of priority in that list of
you know never growable populations so i need to find more space that's the only thing that i can
get from this is i need to find more space well also think of long problem though i will just say
never what did you say last time you said right like never growable because it's true i mean it's
like i don't know i mean i i gotta say too it really is um it's a lot especially when you're
not doing it for production um and even if it just it's hard it's hard i have the same i'm like okay
you get her and then you make more and then you get her like what do you do you know it's kind
of like you're back into a corner and then things are always changing and um and then there's new
things to explore so i think it's a lifelong journey i guess well something to to look at
is depending on you know and everyone can kind of do this on their own but if you put down what age
you know you want to you know if you're a commercial operator or if you're even a home cultivator
um if you wanted to put a timetable and say hey you know i want to grow until i'm 80 years old
and then you can do the math and it will actually tell you you know how many turns based upon just
to throw out you know say for a commercial grower if you were to throw out 11 week runs because
you know 10 weeks of growing a week to to reset or eight weeks with a you know a week to reset
but you can do the math and see how many turns you could potentially do within the rest of your
career and you know doing that and obviously i don't want to reveal my uh my age but at the same
time you know that number is getting fewer and fewer um and you know i'd like to be able to say
that i'd like to be able to retire at you know 55 or 60 but you know that's definitely not looking
like it's gonna be happening anytime soon just based upon what uh i'm able to do currently
but i don't know if anyone ever else thought about stuff like that i i love that actually i've never
calculated it into the future you make me a little bit nervous because i'm like i gotta do something
else at some point here um but i've i've i've joked for a while that i think that like different
spaces should have like a grow um like a log with a historical you know like oh even if it's like
notches in the side of a greenhouse or whatever if you have like a space inside because i think that
the spaces that we do this stuff never really get honored and then also you know there are
specific ones that are immaculate and amazing you're like oh remember the like vintage you know
and same with outdoor protection spaces like all of them and so it's interesting because i feel
like we don't do that but i've done like the backwards walk and i'm like oh my god we've done
that many and that you know greenhouse and all these different evolutions of you know uh projects
and hunts and things and just production rounds so i think that uh i think it's kind of a i like
the storytelling aspects of it and i think that's a great great perception i think that it's maybe
something that doesn't get appreciated as much um because it is a finite thing i guess maybe
never thought about it like that everybody's on their calculators all of a sudden everybody's like
how many rounds can i get in and how many more well no the you know it's just the simple fact
that you know now that we can actually you know take data and we can process data that
you know spreadsheets are you know something that you know most people that are working in
the commercial level and then obviously i would say you know um the vast majority of breeders are
also using spread tables to be able to determine the formulas on how you know to be able to make
their projections and stuff moving forward and it's just something that um my my wife actually
brought to my attention by just you know how many turns is this facility able to do a year and then
just kind of making generic formulas to be able to cover you know um this business and its entire
lifetime or you know say in the the next 50 years of operation and actually being able to break down
everything so it's it's definitely almost humbling but at the same time it just goes to show the
importance of putting as much you know heart and soul into these things and also documenting as
much as possible so you know just the the next person that picks up after you is able to utilize
some of the data sets that you were making through your progression to be able to have a business that
continues on that has some type of provenance or respect in the industry because you know what i
hate to see is someone that has put their heart and soul into building a you know a business just
to see it all collapse because either their children don't want to get into that particular
industry or you know they don't have anyone to take over the reins so you know that's why i think
it's important to be able to keep all that information moving forward and to be able to
pass it on but at the same time we all know that you know that's the uh the golden ticket when it
when it comes to uh the operation is those spreadsheets anyways i apologize for jumping
in on a tangent i know i came in completely late um it's been tied up with work here the
the last couple weeks and uh i'll be honest one episode i actually fell asleep through the whole
thing i don't think i commented the whole time so what's up everybody it's nice seeing everyone i
know that this is a really late episode so uh either it started late did it start at the normal time
it's just late i think that's why you're not we're not
hearing from us you didn't disrupt anything we're just i think faded
yeah i i just we are at it is like six hours oh hey peter i thought uh you're there
i am here yeah no i woke up and i was like we're still going i was like
am i hearing chase's voice i was like what where am i
well i was just ranting just because i haven't talked to anybody except for uh mr toad here
lately so uh anyways i guess i i could be the one to help close it out if you guys are all done
because i have no idea what the conversation was and i don't want to even start to be that guy that's
bringing up stuff that's been talked about three hours ago and uh and keep this thing going
no i think we could use that as a good wrapping point what do you what do you all
think i think we're at a total of six hours and 20 minutes
we could probably talk about uh intersex plans for like like super long time
so i mean that was one of those conversations like a never-ending infinite conversation so
we'll just say it's nothing solved right it's like but also i like the idea that people are
like taking naps taking a little nap like oh yeah i just woke up peter we're still going on and on
and on i feel like people are like dreaming about like intersex plans for permacrodite
then i don't know i feel like i you know have some new concepts so i really appreciate um the
conversation always with the deep dive thing and i think we came up with some good other concepts
of um you know i like the mythbusters idea um i think that sounds really fun so we can contemplate
on that and no i already have the great idea for the first episode we have to get that you know
that who did it ryan you would know exactly who did it there's the root thing where they put a
plant in a like a oh fuck i'm all burnt out right now i'm sorry uh essentially something to prove
that the root has a way of judging where the gravity is so i forget who it was but they put
it on like a swinging thing for a long period of time to kind of change the direction to be able
to show that roots could find gravity that they have a point like kind of like our inner inner
earlobe i totally forget exactly what it is but maybe you remember but maybe you don't want to go
on about it i'm quite tired there's something called geotropism i'm not sure the mechanism
this plant definitely can um sense that's why like when you plant a seed the root grows down
right it's like those tomato bucket things that like grow the plant upside down you know
you know those ones like the that's the kind of just like visualize it i'm like
the way maybe this is a thing i don't know but we can make a list of things we could for sure like
it's a centrifuge you like put it in a centrifuge and you plant a seed in a centrifuge and you get
it to the root will grow sideways instead of up and down because of the force of the centrifuge
and i forget who it was that did it to prove this point that you know because people are like you
put this seed in upside down and the root will go up instead of down and then you're gonna fuck
your i just i think that's the funniest thing i've ever fucking heard so i'd love to just
just do and plus we get to make a thing with a with a plant that spins that just sounds fun
i love how it started off as a way to like disprove bro science and now we're building
fucking centrifuges for but that's mist busters right like they they they they built stuff to
bust myths london are you gonna be funding all of these projects
i found the paper that you're talking about here i can certainly imagine
london just feed-based method for identifying novel genetic traits that affect substrate
adhesion in the plant canada sativa i think i think london just wants clearance because as
soon as he gets the go-ahead then he moves on to like from launching plants to dynamite like real
right we'll be blowing i want to plant the centrifuge
if peter gave me permission to be here
just to uh let everybody know i know that i have had this conversation i've just been tied up with
work um i'm finally going to get all the the mail out so peter um tony um
i just things we've talked about in the past i'm going to finally get that all taken care of so i
apologize for the extra weight but anyways um just be on the lookout right on brother appreciate
that well with that should we should we call it oh yeah go dream now does anybody else dream about
cannabis because i might be not the only one right i think we should call it and then go back and edit
part about the felonies
anyways nice seeing y'all guys
what are you talking about i'm talking about birthday card
happy monday have a good night take care all bye
bye
and there we are show is done i hope you all enjoyed the conversation can you hear me
we have the dank hour tomorrow and i hope you're ready to dive deep again because we have
nick from rooted leaf aka nick from um
man i'm tired jason's grow and tell is coming on the dank hour tomorrow as a crossover guest
and we're going to be talking about plant nutrition uptake and essentially we're going to ask what the
fuck planet cannabis plants eat and see how long he can talk for um we'll make sure he's well
hydrated but we're going to see how hard nick can go on this subject i'm very excited for it
and hopefully you enjoyed today's show i look forward to another one
