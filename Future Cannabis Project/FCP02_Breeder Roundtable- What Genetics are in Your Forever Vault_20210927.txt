paired up really nicely so we're gonna try to remake some of that
all right tony tony you gotta unmute yourself
tyler are you there
oh yeah i'm here man i'm figuring this thing out man i found the music
there we go yeah this is like the bad news sorry everyone it's gonna be the
bad news bears a clubhouse i've i've like done clubhouse probably like 20
times in my life these guys probably less
and i'm trying to stream it to youtube
that's great no it's all good man i'm gonna and i see
cheddar cheddar bobs in the youtube cheddar bob can mosey right on over to
the clubhouse room if you wanted to if you help running clubhouse let me
know i can help you mod a little bit what's up
tony
just chilling let's see
that's some good my wife just asked me why i'm talking so loud
that's great i got a few more minutes before mine get home so
i'm doing all right i can yell and scream if i want to
but she's normally the loud one i'm usually the one saying hey
why are you yelling so loud oh i see
hold on
mr dutch bloom step on in the state
yes sir please do
so annoyingly i uh i can't be near my computer
because that's why you guys are getting the feedback because i have two phones
and i'm not getting texts from my wife no i'm good you sound crystal clear to
me man we're doing good you sound great to me man
so hey hey everybody what's up what's up dudes welcome to the conversation
i'm sitting here packing seeds just listening to youtube and i saw this
pop up i'm like yes i'm wearing that i'm wearing the old dutch
blooms hoodie right now man i was like hell yeah dude
so that's funny it's the same way
so we're waiting for uh chase and uh kevin
let me just uh and then we'll get started
hold on let me text chase and kevin dude i just pulled out these pumpkins
uh these little babies yesterday and baked them down made friggin out of four
friggin pumpkins i made i made two badass pumpkin pies
and two giant friggin pumpkin bread loaves
and i'm pumping out you know i got seeds i'm all i'm all fired up dude so
you know we're gonna run the spring well what was the variety that you were
growing it was it's just an old heirloom um sugar pumpkin that's just a
little a little mini sugar pumpkin some sort
like that i don't know what exact one but it's an heirloom sugar i
think is what it's called uh but they were small they're real tiny
man they weren't like super tiny like like baseball but they were like
grapefruit size and uh meaty as hell man out of out of these
four little pumpkins i got all i got all that stuff man it was nuts man
yeah bro i was stoked yesterday was a pumpkin day
talk about shucking seeds you know you gotta get them out of that fucking goop
and all that fun stuff it's never fun there's
no there's no seeds that i like shucking you know kale is pretty cool you know
and stuff like that because it just falls out but
you know goddamn seeds are a pain in the ass bro
so that that purslane uh that is a prolific cedar
awesome awesome yeah man that's uh one of the i mean you can look up
purslane that's that's one of them you know
one of the most nutritious plants around and everybody treats it like a weed it
grows like a weed i can't kill it around here it grows
everywhere man um but you can find it in every like
holistic book and like nutrition chart and stuff like
that but yeah man i like it i used to i used to
grow it um in my microgreens when i was when i was
growing microgreens i would that was one of the ones i would offer
oh yeah like in the wild they always come up
they always grow with uh the false purslane i don't know like
i don't know why i don't know how but somehow there's always this false
purslane that grows with the real purslane
um the real purslane is really succulent type you know really robust and then
this false purslane kind of looks like it and grows like it but has this little
purple dot and it's like really thin and not not succulent type uh that one's
nasty but for some reason it's really trippy how
you know those two always travel together you know what i mean no matter
what in like a natural setting it's it's
very uh it's very cool very cool and very much
pan the ass
sup kev he needs to use the uh i think the
uh is it porta luca is that what grows
kevin can you hear us yeah i can hear you fine
amazing what's going on not much well why don't we uh let's just
get things going and uh tyler you want to kick it off and just
talk about kind of what you kind of keep in the
in the vault for long term and kind of why like and
where you got it from and why you keep it well uh that goes like for me it goes
pretty it goes way deeper than you know like the the cannabis like i
was just i was just talking about like you know
the pumpkins or the the corn or um you know the the purslane
all those different types of things i'm always saving seeds the
of the best ones and every year i find myself planting the same ones over and
over again um but cannabis wise
i mean there's you know my i love my library um and there but
there's a couple of them that like if i lost it would be it would be terrible
uh you know the pam obviously isn't you know super important
um not because it's the greatest weed in the world but because it's you know
it's been with me forever i love i love every bit about it
and uh you know she's she's something special
something a little different something a little uh you know
a little special um the dog walker i almost lost one time
and uh i was almost okay with it and i ended up pulling it out of the
last mother i had it was in full flower like five six
weeks in the flower stacking hard and i ended up cutting off
a bunch of those lowers and rooting them and pulling it all the way back out
and i almost lost it most of them didn't take and
god i'm thankful um that i didn't lose that thing
um because you know without the dog man i don't know
i've had a lot of things i've you know i've popped a shitload of
fucking seeds i've i've i've smoked the best weed
but something about that goddamn dog walker you know like i still
just to the day i was i was out there man got
got a couple of nasty stacked up and i walked right over to her and i
you know put my fingers right up underneath there and
holy shit every single time it makes you just go fucking
woo or ooh wee it demands some sort of a response out of you that
that you don't normally a sound that you don't normally make on the regular you
know it pulls it out of you you know it's like there's just
something about it man um but yeah those are those are two they're
real special to me there's a couple that kev's given me
that i'll never lose you know um just out of like it being old cutlery
um things that you know change the game i'll
keep that stuff as as a you know as a historical piece and
an enjoyable piece but that dog and uh the pam because it's
my namesake you know those those two man those two are good ones
those are good ones
Tony how about you?
Oh man uh i i've had a few lines for a few years uh
ones that were not my own um the bubble cush
and the fire og those are plants i've held for 16 years
um i like to keep them in the garden specifically for breeding purposes
um a lot of people don't actually uh enjoy growing either one of them
especially when you put them in the same room together they don't produce
and most people are growing weeds just to produce uh and those for me i always
used for uh medicinal purposes they they always
worked killer for me that the blue dream i also held for 16
years i use that for uh medicinal purposes with my mother's
conditions that she had uh in the early 2000s helped get her off
of uh um depression medication using the blue
dream and some of the crosses i made with it early on
um i've got uh let's see what do we got messing around here i know this stuff
that i i gotta cut that kevin knows about
there the congo that robert tree congo that's that's some herb that
can kick you in the butt real easily um it's something that uh old timers that
don't enjoy some of these new new crosses can
that's it'll just wrap right around your mind and send you to
places that you haven't been in a long time for me that's some of that time
tribal type herb that and that pure kush uh kevin
passed me that thing there that's a killer plant right there man if
any of y'all have tried that thing that girl uh she's she's nice man i'm
telling you she's a very good i'm trying to reverse that right now man
that's a good one oh nice nice i just dropped some afghani
on that hell yeah i haven't reversed nothing on her i have
hit her with regular pollen and she makes some killer crosses man
uh killer medicinal plant also good for
neurological issues um that stuff's killer the first piece that kev gave me
i brought back and gave to my mom because
it's some old school herb that she remembers and the first thing she was
all about was man that stuff takes my pain away i'm like that's a boy i brought
home you got to check this shit out right
here so that thing i've had in my garden for a little while
i'm actually uh packing up conga leafs across the mean mugs right now that are
going out that conga is nice man that plant's a
greasy old school type girl she um she flowers a little bit longer but
she put packs on weight the whole way through so
she doesn't just end up with the areas bud she gives you some
powerful herb that for me is killer for concentrate
she makes a killer uh bubble hash that you can turn into
raws and high grade press that stuff extremely low
and enjoy those terpene profiles that are waking up out of her from heat and
pressure um it's insane she's fucking nice she's
nice
i bet i haven't had it as a concentrate yeah she's killer that with the haze
mixed together to concentrate i was seeing white i took two hits of
the uh rosin from that stuff and i haven't gotten that high in a long
time it was a the haze the congo and uh
the um the topanga you know the topanga also those three i crossed
together but enough you helped me make the bubble hash so we just mixed
everything together after i washed it we dried it and then
i've been pressing it at 10 to 15 grams at a time
and stuff coming off of there will kick your ass like you're back in high school
it just messes you up it's it's it's mean stuff um i'm gonna
do some fresher this year off of the congo this stuff's all stored in my
drying room i had a lot of health issues so i wasn't
able to get to everything so when i finally was able to here i had
my nephew come over here and run a bunch of hash for me
so i got a bunch of hash i've been pressing
but that girl's greasy you just touch her and she leaves trails of grease all
over you trichomes are extremely oily um
extremely terpene and i mean the smells that come off that plant are crazy
my brother was out there like he can't handle the smell it's too strong for it
too too intense he's like what the hell just
spray on that plant i'm like water that's it man that congo is old school
weed that's the kind of weed you'd go you would walk through an old patch of
that shit and they're gonna smell you for two or
three days for sure man that stuff just embeds itself in your skin
and you need an alcohol bath to get the grease from that plant off you
you know what i love too is it has a really manageable body on it for
something that has such a tip the top of your head off high it can
it can hold itself up outdoors beautifully in the in the rain and the
weather really resistant i mean it's it's
quality i can't wait to do josh what'd you what'd you uh you laid you laid
pollen into that yeah i've done a few actually i just sent
out a pack to uh vision um who's kind of been the guy who's
holding it up in bc him and i have been doing some messaging
back and forth so i sent him the mean mug which is uh jeans root beer
uh gmo root beer cross um i selected a couple killer males out
of there and i put one of them onto the congo and i'm really excited
about that because uh i actually think i'm hoping that it'll be
able to bring up the yields on that um congo for the hash because i it
is so greasy i just did a run of a bunch of stuff a bunch of tests like
2030 varietals it was a ton of fucking work um and the
congo was only like under a per under a percent it was so
disappointing you know the yield i mean it's it's literally gold you know in
your hands and holding it and i'm like realizing you know it's kind of actually
set me on a whole thought pattern realizing the value of
different hash you know like you know because right now
hash is valued it's valued in what it what it dumps
you know but but something like the congo that gives has such a different
effect and flavor you know it may not dump so we're gonna
have to turn the turn the price up on it but
our market really isn't quite there yet you know so
different grades and classes uh different stuff like
not all hash is the same kind of shit there's people out there that'll smoke
anything you call hash and then there's cats that will smoke that like
i said it's an old school herb that takes you back to a different place
it has a completely different effect on you it's it does not dump massively like
uh like a lot of people are looking for but
what comes off of her is just top grade stuff man the hash off of
that plant is so tasty it's oh man it's
it's it's beautiful man last year i made a full run of just that
congo this year i had to uh wash it in a bunch in a big batch i didn't have
enough plus i was too jacked up from being
injured
i don't know uh if if it's like necessarily that
like i think we need to like find better ways to extract the greasy resin you
know what i mean because that that shit will clog up your bags and do all kinds
of crazy shit but if you have like like uh charis cattle's on your hands or
something and you could like go rub the rub that
greasy hash off of fresh plants you know what i mean and harvest it that way
i wonder if the the yields would change with a
with a different method you know on those on those types of heads
i'm thinking steam extraction would be the best effort on that because of that
fact that as soon as it hits water or any
kind of turbulence those heads pop and a lot of it gets lost
straight in the water if you could figure out a way to collect
those uh those trichome heads much earlier in the process you would get a
much much uh higher uh higher um dump off that
plant for real she she would do it um it's just
different processing i would i would want to do steam distillation myself
i'm fresh frozen probably it's odd that it's so oily for being so
so mold resistant do you know what i mean like it it has
it has like high desert traits it doesn't have the trite density but
it's got that wax that usually stuffed equatorial doesn't
you know what i mean it's weird it's got that open structure that breathes but
it's a grease monster she is as she is
i'm sorry for uh jumping in late guys uh howdy to everybody
uh was at work a little bit later um i did want to uh throw in um what do you
guys believe that we've actually done by breeding for numerics on the thc
side obviously a plant could only hold so much information
and i found that cannabis being so homogenized now which
in my forever stable i try to have representations
of cultivars from every continent on the earth so that way i have a little bit
of variety that that sets me apart from everybody else
but i think that because of poor breeding practice is that
we've been put into a position where what have we potentially lost or what
have we potentially gone towards in a way that's kind of
disruptive to the turf profiles that we're all chasing
in our current state of cannabis
well you know i mean the base paints if if we if we look at
you know what was the original populations globally it gives us kind of
an idea of where we all started i try to kind of go back into where
something made an inception and then made its mark and if i can get
into that time frame with the plant's entry into the
system then everything that's downstream of
that i could potentially recreate you know and so i think that you know
with with the homogenization of product today
it's just because that's what the market wants when the market wants it
different we can take it different just because you jam a pile up doesn't mean
you can't unjam it it's it's unfortunate that we log jammed
it so heavily but the bottom line is when you open up
a population you can go back and steer it throughout wires and start to shift
and and explore the stuff that we're not
seeing you know i mean the the bottom line is what i think what has to happen
for you know collection is that you have to
get people enthused about collecting you have to get the population around us
enthused about collecting cannabis and participating in preservation and
just appreciation and that the growing of cannabis is
celebratory and that there's an ability to you know share and move
genetics in a in a really easy manner because what ends up happening is you
have a living library so for me i've had multiple collections
that got jacked and it taught me some really valuable
lessons about you know when we define like what's our library and what do i
hold the part that was really i think
essential is who's holding it and so for me you know i i put an
unbelievable amount of material into the system so that
people that were about herb could hold things that had real quality
and i think that that's you know what what our job really is to degree is if
you're somebody who is known for collecting because we
know what genetics are in your forever stable
every fucking one of them i got that's what that's which ones are in my
forever stable all of them
you know what i'm saying like that's just how it is because they're all
important and every single thing i put in the box
is important every seed i get to collect is important and every plan i share is
important because i wouldn't have collected it if it
wasn't it must have had some resonance to me to make it worth my time and i try
to identify the why but i try to make sure that you know you
move the material into the hands of people around you
to the degree that you can so that what you have is this unbelievable
increase in quality of what everybody gets to grow
everybody deserves to grow good grass and so when you can pass some seed on and
pass some clone on you're not just preserving the line you're
preserving the culture you know it's it's it's that's the part
about you know the gene pool is that it's it's best shared
what are your guys's thoughts in regards to
um auto flowers and feminized as far as working a line because for me i don't
have anything that's feminized in my stable nor do i work
feminized lines but i understand the importance of it for home growers and
lower skill set operators but in a commercial setting um
outside of trying to get two harvests in an outdoor season i can't justify
um running autos um and and feminized for me i think that you know it was a
way to be able to protect ip initially um is why people meant and what they
were bred for not necessarily trying to uh
um you know go the the best way of being able to do stuff because you didn't have
a male to be able to cultivate so just because you can do something doesn't
mean you should well i mean with with with auto flowers
you know the the technology gets better and better and what it lets you do it
lets you work in some strange environments because the plants have a
higher resistance in general so they're they're a tool they you
know they fit a purpose but for feminization if we're talking
about like self in a plant and going into it
it's how you really start to identify the traits and so like once we get into
like large scale breeding everything is
feminized so that you can take a look and concentrate genes
and so it just comes down to you know what are we trying to do
so for me when i when i get a hold of a population that's that hasn't been what
we call stabilized but it's been utilized so something maybe you know
afghanistan pakistan but from a specific
group i don't feminize those what i do is i lay the male and the female into it
because i don't have enough genes to preserve
and so if i can create a big population now i can take a look at a big
big snapshot now i can take the outlier out of that and then i can feminize that
and i can open that population up big so that i can start to identify in that
population of what i'm seeing what's my outliers
and so like for breeding purposes we want to have some heavy fixed traits
and for production purposes you want things that have you know combined
so i just think it's it's really about what's the need of the individual
and i don't think there's really a right or wrong with it anymore
at one point you know i was like god fuck them nice seeds because i was i was
afraid we were shrinking gene pools but i realized that in order to create a
plant that you can actually use at scale that's that has the abilities you want
you almost have to yep yep it's uh it's definitely it's a
tool like uh just like you know you got a different
different plants you know put out different different
needs if it's like a land-raised population you got you got to do things
a little different if you're trying to do something for
long term you can you know you can do it multiple different
ways but sometimes there is no male and there is there is this plant and
you know there's a lot of ways you can attack it uh but
like kev said it's like once you get into like the real the big
you know the cucumbers and you know all the all the
the mass the mass seeds they're all feminized you know for the most part
so it's a good way to shortcut through you know if you find stuff you open
you know you get things traditionally where you want it you find this special
plant you want to make things you know a lot like that special
plant it's a good way to shortcut and leapfrog things
um it's good for you know a lot of different applications
um the the reason why everybody got scared off in the beginning it was just
a bunch of you know a bunch of pioneers you know in
the closets trying to do something that they read about you know what i mean
and it didn't turn out all that great you know or they made a mistake and that
mistake cost you something and then that that that leads to perception you know
but in reality done right it's there's some
there's some radical things you can do um but you got to have it all because
just like the plants just like the genetics you know you can't you can't
say this is the way or that's the way you got to have them all you know you
got to have them all yeah no it's it's and all techniques and
tools well you know what fucks us is we don't have a common gene bank
that you know that you that you have an ability to be able to bank material in
and then put it into a shareable source where others can access it you could act
like pollen banks gene banks and you know you you can you can
blockchain the shit so this way you can always see the movement of it
but for so many of us we have so much stock we're never going to get to fuck
with it you know what i mean like there's a point where you really
can't it's kind of hard to dig through the pile when the pile's over this over
the top of your head that's that's for sure man i hear that
you know you are prolific breedable you laid out a lot of fucking pollen
you know what i mean you made a lot of seed brother yeah but
here we're talking about with the femini seeds feminine
can be a specific cannabinoid you're after or a horc
chemovor status of that plant maybe it produces more on
specific cannabinoids than its brothers or sisters out of it and from that
population you want to open it up through s1s
and s2s and then doing back crosses to the reoccurring female that you kept or
male if you choose a male reversing plants as nature's been using
it for so long it just didn't use the selection that
process that the humans have it just said this plant's dropping pollen that
females are ready to take it and some of the population ended up
making seeds that came from uh stamina nodes that came from females
that had stamina flowers on them some of them came from true males and
some of them just came through happenstance maybe somebody went
through there or an animal from another patch and ended up pollinating
something so we the way the plants bred uh if we're
really going to dive into the population you want to try to open up
any way you can and feminization is a way to do it
accidental pollination is a way to do it i mean we can do all kinds of crazy
stuff i used to do all kind anything i could
think of with pollen to try to figure out what was happening with it
since i i couldn't afford any of these uh tests
for doing genetic uh code on the plant i can't figure out which one of the plants
in that stable is doing what specific thing what traits is
it passing down to the population next from it which filial generation is
it uh getting a higher allele frequency and did i pick wrong
i just had to do it through breeding so i just started dumping pollen on plants
whenever i had the chance uh segregating them i just had large uh
amount of people that i could select through to do this
through so many people in 215 days wanted to learn how to make seeds so
you could go over to their spot and set up a system for them to make seeds and
you could do different experiments in everybody's garden
people got shit inside hidden in the most cracks of their walls
it was crazy what people were setting up for collecting pollen
you could try almost anything well i just compare everything to like
what you would do from like a a horse breeding standpoint or a dog
breeding standpoint that like you guys all said it yourself that you're
cutting corners by being able to do that so yes
you are looking at it from a a large population standpoint but at the
same time whenever you're looking at large populations of shit you're still
looking at large populations of shit which you know that one outlier you know
for me i look at it as if you're trying to
breed a fairly bred horse that you wouldn't try to
do anything weird besides standard breeding unless you actually start
getting into the dna of the horse and actually trying to
chase can you uh your audio is a little muffled
oh let me get my headset well no no that's much better
i was gonna say chase you know maybe i may misunderstood but um
like one of the ways i'm using feminization right now i have a room
behind me that's got about 30 males in it and i'm just they're kind
of rebadging to be to be honest because i was pulling them from outside
in about a week they're going to be all set and i'm going to flip them
again and then and then reverse them so that i can look at the expression they
have in the female form and then take in
them and then use those back on themselves i'll take the cuts
and put those back on them and then when i look through the progeny i'm going to
have a pretty fucking clear picture of what those males look smell taste
like and what they put on the progeny and it saves me like a couple
generations so it's not necessarily that you're cutting corners and and doing a
less quality project it's just you can get to get to an end result a little bit
faster
that's the way i'm looking at it you know a potential anyways
and they are they are they are sorry kev they but they are they are plants they're
not they're not like they're not animals and the plant in in its original form
and its land-raised form has high in general has high hermaphrodite
you know hermaphroditic tendencies like they've been making themselves for
generations and there really is no no no pure form that's just how they
survive that's how they replicate so it's not not not better or worse any
other way and it's not it's not like short cutting or cutting a
corner it's it's just using something that the plant does
naturally because technically they're all herms we've
just kind of pushed them towards one side or the other
by by the way we you know selected them so
yeah go sorry kev oh no it's all good dude we're all excited and shit
you know what it's i understand what chase is saying though because it's
really about like inbreeding depression so you you you it's it's in what you're
selecting that you're selfing you start to have too much of a
concentration of traits and you lose a bigger component
but the thing is is that you don't use that work
as your production plant you use that as a plant that you're going to lay those
traits on top of another plant and so in in in i'm not
familiar with horse breeding but i am familiar with dog breeding
and with dog breeding it's the same thing too where we're trying to put
together some inbred lines that allow us to get a really solid base
of traits we want to desire and then the the breeding is complementary because
the traits enhance each other and then the progeny
should have the vigor we want capturing the traits of the two p1s
and that's the issue i think with when we go into feminization is that
what takes place over time is that you keep concentrating genes
but you're also reducing vigor of the plant on a commercial perspective and
that's really what cultivar is is plants for commercial usage
it's things that were selected for commercial usage that you know that you
know scientifically it would be the result of two inbred lines but
really in practice it's plants that we use for production
and so in order to have a production cultivar it's you know you could sift
out two inbred lines and then combine them and that
resulting hybrid would have the vigor you wanted
and then through a selection the traits and that plant now is valuable
that's something that has a value to anybody downstream from it because
you've stacked so much material into it that when someone got a hold of it
and they opened up that population they would open up a quality population
that's the shit that should be released to home breeders home breeders should
get a hold of a network and because i used to do this for people like
i'd find a male that laid something heavy out and i'd say hey look this is a
gas mail this thing throws gas on anything we touch it to
you need a copy so you can go and have some fun with all the plants that are in
the system right now and what it did is it got a bunch of
young young people older people excited about
breeding cannabis just because it was such a neat thing
and and for me it's it's bringing that um
you know getting the involvement of the public into it to where you know for us
for like all of us that are older now you know genes are priceless
but when i realized that we kept losing them in raid and all kinds of bullshit i
realized you have to get them into the people around you you got to get them
into the periphery because once the plants are gone they'll
some of these things are priceless and they've been taken away because of the
war on drugs so you know now it's trying to really
drive some of this new stuff forward and you know create a you know better
information that's why i love the the cannabis project because it's no
matter where i go people always talk about what an
awesome platform it is
what's up guys what's up guys what's up rebel
hey kevin how's it going
what's up thanks for letting me join the conversation yeah great conversation
you know to go back to what kevin was talking about about
you know the fem seeds for production and you know if one of the
the minor factors is that you lose a small amount of vigor
you know for large-scale production losing a small amount of vigor in a fem
seed line is nothing compared to the vigor that you lose
and the risk and the associated cost labor
work everything with cutting clones commercially so really fem seed has got
to be the future of you know commercial production on scale
you know for small craft farmers i think there's always going to be
something special about growing out f1s and worked lines and selecting you know
unique standout plants that you know different
farmers can identify with as as their unique exclusive cut i spent a
bunch of time this summer going through lines
um and i don't really have a lot of experience with fem lines
finally i'm able to kind of test a bunch out with different partners
different areas at scale and it's it's really cool to see the difference in how
you know s1s and hybrids are breeding compared to the regular
male female combinations that i've been making for years and even in my lines
and so what i found is you know when you
make a good combination and something is dominant towards what
you want if it's a vigorous plant you know you're you're not losing
anything you know it's it's nothing noticeable
and just like anything else when you make a combination which is
dominant the wrong way that you want you know then you you go back a step
but it's it's been cool to kind of do both side by side and see the results of
that for the first time it's kind of nice to have a taproot too
versus the clone you know that's um i've just noticed that when i put out
clone stuff right next it's like that taproot they really suck up the water
and they get down there um you know during those dry summer months
and just just quickly dan uh what what's been in your library long term and why
you know i don't think i'm like organized you know enough to keep a
consistent library but i have classics that i always want
to get back um for working into bat crosses and stuff
like that um i've just tried to stay away from stuff
that ultimately becomes really like popular
and kind of like uh you know modern because i just like the feeling of
having something that's unique you know just like as a hobby smoker i want to
smoke something that's different or that that i created um but you know i
always go back to the old old sour and the old diesel cuts those are
kind of my favorite flavors you know if you can get them right in seed form
which is difficult you know to to breed them in in dominance
you know old sour cuts old og cuts and then just you know random classics but
you know my farm is off grid and now we can run
you know year-round moms in our greenhouse um in humble but generally
what i do is i just pass genetics to other people and hope they don't
fuck them up and um and try to get stuff back when it's
needed
but in my stable you know the only stuff that i really have is
is stuff that i've selected from seed over the last five years with a few
exceptions of a few older ones but just finding new standout plants
from my lines and keeping those clones for production and
getting as many people to grow them out and find the next best thing and send it
back to me to try
you've always been hella fair with your genes though like you know what i mean
you you've you've never-endingly woven genetics
into the system like both as a business but just as a as a as a genetic brother
yeah you've been you you've moved a lot of a lot of genes into the system dan
yep you too my friend
but that's what it's about i mean that's that's what i like about
you know cannabis you know would i rather like smoke a joint and sit in a
room and fucking do nothing or would i like i i you know i just
i like to hang out with like-minded people who are into the unique traits
and characteristics and colors and flavors and textures and people
who are cool who are gonna nerd out just as much as me about it
and i love i love seeing growers um experience something that i created
it's not like a ego-based thing but it's just
a very rewarding feeling for someone to come and say oh my god i grew those out
and wow man that was so special you know that's just a cool feeling
i know i know people who built entire their entire business model was based
off of your ogcd work and i mean for like 10 years they did
unbelievable production stunning work with one with one plant
yep yep and man i mean we have so much cool stuff that i'm working on with that
same mom and i didn't breed that mom you know i
found that in a pack of somebody else um but you know it to me it was historic
because it was my first year in humboldt and the guy that i worked for you know
let me have this one greenhouse for the seeds that i brought from my collection
and i was growing all these seeds from the neighborhood and all this cool stuff
and he had a guy that was his his partner who
wasn't very good at growing probably still isn't and i gave these guys a
bunch of seeds and i'd been nerding out and collecting seeds i gave him like
fifteen hundred dollars worth of seeds which was a lot of money to me
back then and he fucked them all up and over watered them and you know didn't
pay attention and so i i asked if i could start some i went
to town and uh went to sylvan dales and i got some
like t5s and a couple domes and i just set some
shit up in the closet you know off-grid in this house run off solar and popped a
bunch of my seeds i was like see i told you they grow
and so he gave me this one little greenhouse and cut clones off
everything on the farm that year so 131 130 something females from that farm
over like 400 females i had like 70 or 80 males cloned and the only thing that i
took with me when i left there were the clones from
that one greenhouse and one of them was that
that og chem and uh so i can't take credit for
but it's a cool story for me that you were able to spread it to so many people
and it was one of the first kind of gassy cuts around that had serious
potency you know i used to sell it to clubs and
do really well with it and they'd always say you know they'd
be like this is outdoor i'd be like yeah they'd be like
how much sun you have where you live but what's cool is
i've done a lot of work to stretch it out more and
you know have longer and sturdier branches and alleviate some of that kind
of susceptibility to the to the powder mildew and really
anything beef it up and dense it up you know more at the same time and
improve the cannabinoids another question about the cannabinoid
fat strain you know variety brings up a conversation with is i was talking to
a buddy you know who's working on on some you know scale breeding projects
you know with my genetics and he's telling me that he thinks that
there's something about the lab testing that changed around that
time you know like 2016 2017
where the same varieties that were hitting the early 30s 31 33 percent
cannabinoids and thc was a really big deal those same
exact cuts all of a sudden started hitting 37
38 you know 39 and so he i agree yep and we had this debate where i'm
like well it's global it's got to be global warming
you know for the outdoor crops a combination of like a changing climate
and people getting better at growing and
learning more about intelligent inputs and building more microbial diversity
and soils like people are just stepping their game up
and he's like yeah but we're seeing the same results indoor so
that was the debate he and i were having about
that cut and others from that time is did people get better at growing them
you know or did the lab standards change and everybody's getting an extra
four or five points yeah no i can't i can understand about optimization but
the bottom line is the the herb that was you know we have a
you i would as i'm looking at an athena feed schedule sitting here that i picked
up at the grow store i was just curious um you have companies that are putting
together some pretty good mixes that allow the plant to really
push out and they have killer lighting systems and they have the ability to
keep the plant breathing the whole time indoor
outdoor you have an unbelievable amount of knowledge and biological delivery and
there's people growing in some unbelievable climates
but that's been going on for a pretty long time in the in the in the in the
fringe and it's in the fringe that i noticed
that the numbers have just increased dramatically
but i don't think the quality of the flower has the flower these people were
growing 20 years ago was supernatural too different morphological
traits different profiles but don't tell me that
fucking weed was bunk so what i know is that
since i looked at 10 000 lab analysis i'm like i'm telling you that the
the they when they they jump from 20 to 30
and then they go from 30 to fucking 40 and so in a minute i'm telling you
they're going to be putting 50 on the fucking label
and that would mean that half the fucking weight of that product
is thc and that's i think it's physically impossible
unless we're in the category of rosin yeah i mean led technology is doing
some crazy stuff you know imagine what it's going to look like in five years
you know in all the development but yeah it's definitely a trip
i don't think it can go that far i mean i got turned on led through heliospectra
so when heliospectra came to the us i got chosen as their
their test operator and it was just uh it was probably one of the best
educations i ever received because i got to work with a bunch of brilliant light
engineers from europe and so they would fly over
and we would run the experiments on the plants in the shop and then i would run
the controls on the hps and then i got to play around with all
the different controllers on the pad once once they had their information
they said now let's go play and see what's up
and the bottom line is you know you can tweak a plant you can do a lot with it
i just have a hard time
seeing the numbers make sense to me in in a rhythm they they i've watched them
rise over time and i just realized that they're jumping
in huge amounts i don't think we're necessarily stimulating it that much i
think the testing standards are a little off
i mean what you need to have is a government lab test it
right and then that would be the standard so that would become the
standard and then anything then from that point forward we would
all use the same test standards and the same calibrations
because otherwise what i don't really worry about the numbers being high or
low what i worry about is consistency in
numbers so if i'm if i'm having a lab test something i'm playing with and i'm
hitting 28 and i'm running it again and i think
i've optimized my shit and i get 29 3 i say good i'm dialing it in i go down to
24 i have to ask why did i lose those numbers and
that is how i use numbers because to me i'm just trying to get an idea of
numerically what's going on in the plant but i know that
they there's they're so varying depending on what lab you use still
that it's not really a proof of anything but it's to me it kind of helps me
navigate sure yeah i mean one example of my experience with that is
you know we had a really good year a couple years ago and got some really
high test results the next year with the fires you know
we were evacuated due to you know sneaking up through the
fucking police barricades we missed a few waterings we
underwatered a little bit we missed a few feed and t applications
you know we usually you know spray some different bacillus stuff you know make
sure we don't have any powder mildew you know up to a certain point so we
missed some of that and i noticed on the lab tests
you know 37 percent cannabinoids went down to you know 33 and a half percent
cannabinoids 39 cannabinoids went down to 35 36 you know stuff that
was 28 29 was down to 23 and so i was able to see our missteps you know
just just in comparing those and uh and now we'll have this year you
know to see if we went back to doing everything right
well fuck the fires when the fact that you got a crop in at all
that was doing it right fires they're real
that'll change the way you grow dope yep yes sir
yes sir man they've been popping up all over around here man there's always a
helicopter dropping water on something around here it's crazy
it's i don't remember that ever in my life
but yeah they're real do you think that'll really mess
affect the california market kev or anybody
well i mean california the the thing is that you know when we talk about the
california market the places where they're growing the
most weed you know the central valley you know coastal and then santa
barbara southern california coastal um these fucking guys are drilling holes
into the ground like exxon so they're pulling as much water as they
want um that's that's there's enough canopy
just in those two locations to fill the whole state
so the the thing is that most of the smaller operators in the in the places
that have historically grown what we would call good california dope
um they're the ones that are struggling most with the water issue because you're
at higher altitudes and you're you don't have that big
infrastructure for industrial greenhouse ranges which is what those regions were
built for so you got industrial ag regions built
that that had um no business no no no market for cut
flowers no market for the product that made these houses valuable so they're
sitting fallow they get turned into cannabis
production facilities so they have the ability to pull water as deep as you can
go but for the the craft farmers though man
california fucked them this year good because
you're just having a drier situation in general and
and and i can't prove this to be true but i had this discussion with someone
the other day and i talked about how i thought the urban humboldt was better
20 years ago in terms of tactile feel across the board
and we started theorizing that it was because it had this moisture environment
and you had more microbial life living within this
realm and everywhere there was herb growing it was mixed in within these
forests and it imparted something different to the
the texture the feel of it and so you know to me i don't think that our
our impact on urban in so hum is as good as it once was
because of this drought and so i think that it's pretty moist and we'll get
back to what we're known for which is a far greasier product
yeah i'll second that kev you know i i don't i've been there for 20 years but
you know i remember every season you know 2009 to the current
and it was a darker color to the flower i always thought it was
was global warming you know i was i was uh on a conference a while back and
and hezekiah uh was there and he was talking about this variety
that his family's had for like you know decades and decades and grown
in this region versus that region and he's like it's just the texture of the
same variety it's just different and it's got to be the climate
and you know i come from the east coast and i always kind of told people like
i still like that kind of northern new england
you know you know french canadian outdoor because it was so
terpy you know it's just it's so sticky delicious and i think that
you know the moisture um and humidity definitely
you know has a lot to do with the the flavors and the terpenes that are being
produced and i you know just look at the humboldt
slurs we have they're fucking drier and they're hotter i remember the smell
like the first time i ever came to humble and the first farm i was ever at
it was august august 10 2009 i'll never forget the smell in the air
you know though and so every year i can just think of the different time of
year in august what it smells like and now august doesn't smell the same
anymore
now we've had a radical change in what's taking place because of the drought
and it was funny but i was i was thinking about one of my buddies
um years ago got sent out to france to investigate
why this historic grape field was was struggling
and so he went out to to the investigation and he
he asked him he said hey i see all these surrounding forests it looks like you
had some logging that's happened over the last couple years and he said yeah
we cut back some of these oaks and so he said i wonder if that you know has any
relationship to what's taking place and he went he took a look and he couldn't
figure it out and he he said i wonder if it's up in the leaves and he took a leaf
sample and he took a soil sample and he found that the that on the leaf is where
these uh bacterial colonies were forming and
rain would wash them into the soil and then they would migrate into the
roots of the grape but when you cut them back
far enough the the bacteria couldn't migrate
to the roots and it didn't give them the ability to handle
the the the issues they faced in that location
and so it was this interrelationship between the oaks and the bacteria on the
oaks and how it worked with the grape and so it was it was just a revelation
to me because it's just the complexity of a
of a situation that you know we talk about what we're doing on our farm
but you have the whole earth impacting what's taking place period
and it's it's uh it's almost like you know do we have the ability to recreate
what we used to do in the past do we have to change our expectations to where
cannabis now is not greasy from here it's more crunchy
shit from the desert's bone dry you know are the regions recreating
you gotta move to bellingham where it's cold
and wet
yeah but you know what though the the the beauty of what you do is the stuff
that you work with if it can survive your situation that
shit is an absolute insurance policy in bad weather
no it is i was actually just talking with a guy today he's he's from
my neighborhood but he's out in colorado and he
his long-term goal is he wants to move back here and uh so we've been talking
for a few months and he was today he called me he's like man you know i
think i'm gonna go to eastern washington you know where it's it's dry over there
you know on the other side of the mountains it's like a desert
it's drastically different than what people think of washington
um and i was like you know what man yeah it's you know it is drier because i was
giving them the humidity woes and i was like but to be honest
i'm just about here you know to get my greenhouse dialed and have the right
proper equipment and once i do i prefer to have the ease
of the humidity that's here because it really stacks
the flavor it stacks the trichomes um i mean i totally agree with you like i've
been the work i've been able to do has been finding stuff that's going to work
in this gnarly environment so it's going to work really well for other people
and that's the feedback i'm getting but i'm also just really you know
kind of what you guys are saying i'm enjoying the humidity to a degree you
know oh hell yeah no no it's every climate
brings out specific attributes you know like for
me my fixation with my farm was the ability for the plant to become almost
like encrusted it was it was it was crunchy with this
slick viscous material on it man i was just
transfixed by that the amount of bioprotectants the plant
had to produce just to survive in the location
and so to me when i'm burning it and it the smoke is coming out of the paper
sideways like if you hold the joint and the smoke is moving through the
paper up through like a sheet of smoke not an end of a
ash smoke i like that you know as a smoker i want something that's
absolutely you know full and so the farm turned me on in that way
and it but it you know i'm limited to things that really shine in that
environment so you know for people that have a rough
situation it's a good sifting spot and your spot to me is it you can you
can pull out some really really nuanced turf profiles you don't see in
the heat i mean that's that's that's going to be a
lot of what you know the concept of that like
finding what is is unique about your area and f*****g exploiting the s**t out
of it you know and making that that that thing really well you know
yeah using the heat man down here um the the turps that don't flare off or
burn off quick uh all that stuff that that that lends well when you're
searching through things this this lasts and
you get things to last in the joint you can uh you can do other things if you
kind of you know using the environment that's
that's that's cool you know gotta have your strength you can do
stuff that you know i can't do i i have i can put a different impact on a plant
here because what we have but being in your
area you know you got the ability to work with stuff that's on like the 20
latitude because you're you're in the you're in
the 30 you know and so you can work in that 20
latitude stock and get it to finish and so you know by the time it finishes in
in you know december the temperatures have cooled to where it's going to hold
that quality you know like i i mean i i wish there
was i wish there was a like a an equatorial group down there that
was doing some really awful s**t in that climate i know man i know i wish that i
wish that you know we were able as like a just a culture to
take advantage of the climate you know because
you can pull out some crazy stuff with a little help yeah you can get you can
be finishing some stuff in in december and january you know that's
just it's just now starting to get cold you know it's just a couple you know
you're a couple storms in but like i said with a little help s**t man
uh you're wide open for a lot of stuff which is really cool
um but you know it is what it is yeah i know it's trick man i was i was i
gave a lecture in mexico i was supposed to go fly to mexico to
give a lecture and uh i couldn't i couldn't get the the
dates to line up so the the the group had me shoot a video you
know what i mean so i did a video lecture and sent it down
and it was really it was it was really focused on the fact that you know
mexico's in a position where it has an ability to work you know
everything from pakistan down to cambodia so if we look at around
the world what you know what populations could be worked in that area
they have they have an ability to to really
kill those different climates and then we take the the range up above that
and so it was really about if you could utilize you know all of mexico and as
central america however they you know embrace cannabis or what they do they
don't mexico has enough of a length of it to where between mexico
and the u.s and then up in canada you know to where
even past josh you have a strip of some of the best dope growing in human
history and it's it's where i think at some
point we'll get to actually see what belongs where and we'll be able to once
again grow it where it belongs to grow where it shines
so we don't have to work so much heavily hybridized stock to get the qualities
of both in one package you'll be able to actually grow the package
where it belongs and get the qualities best expressed
from that relationship in that environment
yeah man but the uh it's like the you know all the mangoes all the all the
funky stuff is grown right there anyway all you know
avocados mangoes all the magical fruits grown right through that
that little belt and onward you know so yeah as soon as it as soon as it's like
embraced man that's gonna be a killer like
just a just just a hot spot to grow all the time
every time you know what i mean that's just it just
it's just the way you know for sure building greenhouses and like you know
deep north like tundra you know what i mean it's gonna be hard but
eventually those little places open up for that commercial you know what i mean
it'll be crazy you know just like the mangoes and stuff so
yeah yeah no it's it's every region has something interesting that
some some weed freak went big on you know what i mean like
and i love it man somebody somebody in their closet spent you know 20 years
dialing in something that worked in a wild environment
and when you get to look at it and appreciate it man you dig it
hell yeah just as long as it gets done you know
yeah you know who should be on this conversation too is uh hardy
alex hardy and uh hardy hardy is uh uh good he's he's like you tyler he works
you know multiple uh breeding directions in terms of uh
he's interested he's in the in the breeding period yeah and he does lots
of those land race types and stuff too he's got yeah he does a hell of
survivability work where he's you know he's doing a lot of dry farming and he's
up in the mountains and like at 8 000 foot altitude and
stuff and it's just it's always interesting talking to him because his
approach to it is so survivability based and then
the the quality is sifted in the selection but the the criteria is you
fucking need to live so sadly uh his phone does not have room
to add any more apps on it
he either likes apps or he need an old phone
he has an old phone he has an app addiction
yep i'm addicted to app so i see i i tried to get mojave to come up on stage
but he's shy and tony usually have lots to say
oh man i'm just listening to everybody i don't want to keep jumping in and
having my internet jack everything up so uh
you know it's good hearing your voice tone
it's good and i miss your ass man i miss you too kev brother it's good
to hear from you man for sure 100 man 100 man um i got much love for
you brother you too baby we got to get together just
um christ it's uh we don't live that far no it's not that far really um it's just
fucking my health is what keeps me from going
anywhere that's the whole fucking problem no no we just got kids and so
you know that you're you do the kid thing but i just gotta come over and
just check you out i hear you man you're always welcome
around here for sure you know that thank you 100 100 i just did a cross on
that pure cushy passed me this year with my space cheese i'm gonna be doing some
testing on um she's gonna be a that those buds are
gonna be dense as hell short fast finishing plant um i'm hoping
to get uh a little bit actually bigger plants by
crossing it to my space cheese she's a bigger plant than that's the
pure cush remember that bum bud you had that was rock bud too
yeah man i'm about to pop some of the i did a back cross to the angel using bum
but i call it homophobic because it uh it's it's all a fucking shout out
to my uncle who lived on the street for like 27 years so
um i'm gonna be starting some of those here pretty soon along with uh
some i just started so many l5s and some old i'm
trying to get some old ass fucking afghanis to pop but these things they're
fighting me for everything they got i'm trying every trick in the book
um they had a lot of my own old stuff that i got popping going here
bubble crosses some uh an old uh grape wreck that we used to have back in uh
88 um back in the 215 days we used to move a shitload of that at the uh
berkeley's patient center down there that we used to move all
kinds of that herb down there bomb ass weed it's across to my um
that the grape bread cross to uh avalon magic plant
and uh fire og that stuff's killer so i'm trying to get some of the crosses
from that popped out nice small some older stuff of my own
a lot of a lot of shit most people haven't heard of except for through
some old crosses that i made
what uh what i guess in genetics we guys uh always hold on to
because of a specific um profile like dan i heard you
mention uh the sour diesel lines from my understanding or my
history with you know the plant is sour diesel has always been like
the main line to um um like bisball so i've always like known
that that's like great to like give to people for their stomach for
that reason what i guess like genetics do you guys
like keep close for a very specific reason to never like
lose that one you know profile i mean i i you know to be honest
even though i did so much developmental work with cbd plants
i looked at cbd plants more as like a shotgun approach to health because it
just seemed to blast a bunch of shit when you aimed it at it but the only
plant that that really had a specific effect that worked on a
tremendous number of people was that la pure kush for
spasms and it it was it it was the one plant that i can say
that no matter how many times we put it into a trial
it always had a positive effect on reducing spasticity and so right now i
have it entered into a into a test program so that they can
look at it through one of the new dea accredited labs
because we we know we know now no essay is going to give you enough
information you need to have it on it like
what we're using to look at this shit is like we're looking at with a fucking
loop and you need an electron microscope and
and so i know that what i have is observation
so i know that this plant by accident i saw in in action and the
the conversation i had with the person that i had assisted
led me to see something different and so there i started using that in all these
applications of people who had similar issues but from a variety of different
ailments and it worked and so that particular plant's like the
only one that i have like a it has a purpose
greater than just being an incredible plant that has many purposes
that's the only one that i can say that without question did something specific
can you remember this works real quick what's that can you remember the profile
on that well i'm always like interested in
oh it's profile it's in it's in it's in the pre-98 bubble group so it's in an
afghani cluster such an amazing group it has yep it's
good genes and it it has a stunning chocolate earth
coffee
nose that translates exactly into the mouth
and it holds that flavor all the way till the consumption's done and instead
of having like the narcotic that you'd think with that profile it's
gonna searing sizzling shake you in the ass kind of high
and so the quality the fact to me as a consumer was supernatural but when i
started do what it did in medical applications it changed
it changed my view on on on all medical candidates because i realized that of
all the things i've seen that was the only one that i could say i saw did a
thing and it made me realize the specificity
because all the people that we started bringing into the trials
we would replace it with similar cannabinoid profiles similar
profiles we would try to do whatever we could to find something similar that
would work to see is there is it a family is it a ratio is it
a profile and it was it wasn't it's something
complex within that plant that we couldn't look at through the essay level
we had at that time so i moved it to a higher level essay
and so now we can get looked at you know correctly
and those those those bubble lines are are beautiful i i mean i i think one of
my favorites is uh salmon river from from uh
the dynasty or you know professor p uh it really like keeps that like
chocolatey kind of like coffee note but then also
i mean even i think recently more more recently uh
i think it was archive uh you know uh slammed um i think it was a
do-si-do with bubba and that's just like a resin monster right there just pure
you know like perfume and like chocolate
you know fletcher does good work
i i would i would absolutely agree i mean if you follow
him just for a little bit i mean you see him
tub after tub after tub just tearing and testing i mean he
he does thorough work in my opinion oh no he's good i know him so i mean you
hang out with them you you he's an intense motherfucker boy he's about his
weed and you can't fake that shit and you
know everybody on the pan pretty about that
fucking weed you know what i mean none of us can kind of fake it
fletch knows what he's talking about for sure man that dude will spit
yep yep he's bright and he's he's he's got good market calibration
and i think that the crew that i've met through him you know is the archive
staff and the different spots they've always been nothing but pros but like i
i like to go to this spot in portland and check them out
it's a nice spot you know what i mean like the kid's sharp
yeah yeah i've i've oddly kind of seen him as like it's kind of funny as like
the musk of like the cannabis industry he's very
very very intelligent and just like like kind of listening him uh
you know to him like talk like um you know on podcasts like you can see
that he's very like analytical on like what he's doing and what he's like
saying that's him being about the weed man he's
always about the plant and what it can do and not
what it can do for him but what it actually has in it to do for
for everybody man when you when you really get down into the plant
get deep and dirty with the breeding that plant
it becomes uh something that you can't step away from it becomes one of them
hobbies that anybody can get into that you can't never walk away from once you
really really dive deep into it well he goes pretty you know the thing
about it is the shit he releases his selection is excellent and it's so
strong that i mean that that doci male everybody i mean there was a minute
where it was probably the most heavily used stock by others
to create their stock
that thing was being being pimped out all over town
so his work his work is strong enough for others to base work off of
yeah i mean i mean there's there's even people that have
uh taken it and uh and one you know
one other strain and done a one-off and just ran it
and they everybody forgot what came before but that thing was just glorious
but uh yeah it's kind of
where it came from there's no shame in that i mean i put you know if i put
something into the system and someone does something supernatural
that's that's up to them it's just what you want to make sure is
you track the trace of where the plant came from so that what we have is we
have some form of accurate documentation on what we're really touching and working
with and the custodial history because really the
plants are they're priceless you're you're you're
holding not just the plant history but a history of humans
touching and working with it and sometimes i think these are the only
things left from some of those cultures
like we're touching the trails of time you mentioned it earlier kev but i've
been diving down the blockchain nft world
and just trying to really trying to understand it because it's confusing
but um i really see the blockchain being helpful to our community in terms of
provenance you know and in holding that that lockdown throughout time and
um i don't know people understand it that well but the basic way i understand
it it's sort of like the bank you know like a banking system you know if i want
to pay kev ten dollars i can get on venmo it's ten dollars for for beer here
you go kev and then it you know the bank the banks just talk to
each other and they say well we take ten dollars out of joshua's account we get
ten dollars to kev's account and it's just a plus and
minus and so the blockchain what's that plus a fee yeah plus a fee
and they validate the transaction so if they don't validate that's the key
element difference though they if the bank validates the transaction without
them you can't make the transaction the bank
is the arbiter of the transaction right and the blockchain
and where the blockchain yeah go ahead it's safer
right and so but it's a public ledger across many platforms it's it's all the
information is held in many servers and it's
it's secure and it's public so you know in terms of how we do this with seeds if
i if i want to sell kev a bag of seeds and
then he wants to to sell that bag of seeds to someone
else he can sell it through the chain and you can follow that you can trace it
all the way through to say yeah you know what the guy that ended up
getting those seeds from kev he actually got those all the actually came from
joshua you know type deal it you it does it's
what it does it allows you to follow a chronology a sequence of time
and what it allows you to do is within the
the the transaction within these blocks we can create just like a cell
on a spreadsheet where there's there's an equation that says
when this thing happens this occurs before the next transaction can occur so
that's how people don't get fucked with blockchain is that the money gets
diverted before the transaction gets completed to you and so
someone said well how do i get paid if you're running through digital
currency it's been baked into the the the block and what it's doing is
it's allowing you to make sure that your intent
is being handled because it does it before the next transaction can occur
so you you you use this tool as a digital ledger but because of the way
it's a digital ledger it allows you to put
information in that can say hey we know 0.01 of our transactional rate
or total take goes into you know a community fund
for a genetic development or or what point whatever of that rate goes
back to joshua so when you sell that i get a little kickback
exactly you get paid on your deal but what we need too is everybody's focused
on you know the the i want to get paid but
bottom line is people are trying to put plants on the system to get paid that
they got from someone else and they're trying to say hey i want to
get paid on this plant that i just sent it into the system
what what we need is we need to understand
at best what is the genetic track of the plant
who got it where'd you get it from like it's it's the information's priceless
because it really lets you start to look at the populations in the u.s or
wherever we're gathering genes from and so people are trying to protect
stock and i know people who would just run into stick stock on there like
they're going to suddenly own the fucking og kush
where i have og kush on the blockchain and
and they don't even know what the fuck that means like that's the funny part
but using the tool right allows you to be able to have like a
truly stamped history of what you knew at that
moment and so from the moment of inception we
have what we had but from that point forward for the next 50 years
you would know exactly who touched the plant so if you licensed it to a nursery
they would have to access through the chain to make the order
and when they made the order it would clock how many orders were coming
through and then where the diversions would occur
before they're ever allowed to finish the transaction
so like you can you'd be able to know every bit of the plant's history for the
rest of its life and all the individuals that touched it
almost you know like a living history of everything
you know i think it's really important to be
you know up to date with with all this stuff and it'll blow your mind if you if
you go there and you think about it you know but i really miss being able to
just interact with people and sell them seeds you know selling
seeds online it sucks you know selling seeds at dispensaries the best times
were coming to your place kev you know in
these little weekend events and just meeting the actual people you know just
making friends with people and hooking up seeds like that i just
miss miss that so much and you know i'm always
figuring out oh how do i get seeds to market do i do this or that
and i've been talking with friends the last couple days i'm like fuck i wish i
could just rent a storefront just start selling seeds
you know because that's the best part is the interactional
you know part just kicking it right and um
you know and the other thing is like a lot of a lot of wheat growers it's like
are trying to be homesteaders you know it's like if the internet ever goes away
and all your shit's tied up and all those banks and blockchains
you know like the one thing that i want to have is a lot of seeds
you know of all types but uh you know back to
the genetics i had a question for all you guys you know i generally
you know grow almost you know all my genetics
and i rarely have space or time um to be a collector the way that i used to be
but recently i've started collecting seeds again just realizing
i'm not the only one with good stuff there's some really fucking cool stuff
on the market does anybody want to name any breeders
or varieties that that you've bought from other breeders that you're excited
about i know there's there's a few things
recently you know that it got me excited to you know collect seeds again and stuff
that i'm into you know what i you know what i'm gonna
fucking plug old dutch here because i got that blackwop gold outside
and she she's got so much she got so much shine on her
that it's jumping out on down down the pedio
out onto fan leaves like that thing's encrusted and it's just just
stunning and so that's something that i got to work with recently
that it's my first time running it outside and i'm just
i'm loving it and so um i got i gotta give you a salute on that one i mean my
kid will laugh because that's that's shining in southern humboldt right now
and then that's yeah that's the freshest shit that i'm working with that i think
i'm most impressed with because it really merged the profiles the selection
on it was superior it has just a really really good nuanced
profile and it's stacking right and it's got all the right traits for a
marketable variety but just i haven't smoked it but up to this point
man it's it's pulling numbers since it's got the right rating
um could i ask you this in terms of what you're smelling on the nose
because it translates into the mouth um i'm getting a
orange tootsie roll with the with the lime spritzer
how does that compare to the to the to the black lime reserve that you
have been pushing around well the that black lime reserve that would have added
that lime to it but it didn't have any of that orange tootsie roll
the orange tootsie roll nice man like it's and it's
it's it's a subtle it's a subtle orange but a thick
rich tootsie roll and then that lime sharpens it up so it gives it a
you almost like it's intoxicant it's almost like you smell it hash
where it has a a thickness to it and then the orange cuts in and then the
lime sears across the back of it and cuts it
off oh it's it's it's nice here it's nice man it's all i'm smoking right
now i mean i just was you know give credit
back to gene because it's it's gene's work that that shines through and i
did a good selection um the guy the guy actually made the cross was urban
terp farmer or terp factory he changed it to um down in
um just to south of the bay area san jose
um and uh anyways i did a good run on it and i may in
and this one of this one came out of a 1200 seed on the f2
you know so it's his work i f2d it and pulled this one
actually at the last minute um but going back
forward to this year i ran a ton of gene's lime stuff
um a bunch of the stuff that i had made off of this and off off of his lime
vine stuff and then i got to look at uh lime vine
f2s from another guy that made that made some um
prairie grass selections and um by the end of it i feel like i got a
really good vision i've been talking with gene on the phone about a really
good you know selection on what that lime is
and um the range of the lime you know so to
say and to me to me this was this one just
really grabbed me by the balls and it still does like i kept walking around
the greenhouse i had a couple guys working for me and i'm like
isn't that the best fucking lime still like am i shitting my pants am i just
fooling myself and they're like no no dude you know
that kind of i kind of asked that to everyone and so to me it just represents
a good selection out of out of good breeding from other folks you know
because it used it used that chem dog it used that chem dog special from leo's
end of it that came out of ellie that come out of
um shiloh that come out of uh that operation in willets and it was it
was that chem that that it dominates most of the crosses but
the if you can go through the f2 on the black lime you can kind of push it to
the side a little bit and get more of the lime out
but it's such a heavy full chem that it it was it's laid into that tootsie
roll bottom end so like it's nice man i i'm
going to send it to the lab and get them look at it so i can get a
a terp report on it nice it pulled around 4.2 4.3 uh in the hash and
that's a rosin actually hash rosin yield so that's pretty pretty decent it's
the base of decency i would say the only the other plan i'm digging that
um i got to play with this year that i've never run
like i have like a 25 year old northern lights 5 cut that i'm running this year
for the first time and man it's beautiful but um i've i i'm
familiar with it like i've touched it before in my life you know
but i i'm fucking around with uh the the oh four willie nelson cup winning cut
and that's him and that's an impressive plant outside man she is a good looking
what an interesting profile that's a sexy one in southern half volt man she
likes it here is that a hawaiian variety from um uh man
what's his name steven no it's um it's a cambodian
it's like a black cambodian black vietnamese
into a napolese right on what's the flavors you're getting off of that i
have it i have it here in flower you know big
thanks but i haven't i haven't got the flower yet it's just just about to go to
flower i've got it in the greenhouse oh man she's good right she's got she's
got that classic like you know you know all vietnamese
uh cambodian they all that they have they all have a similar haze like
profile they they it must be uh the terps are designed to protect against
rot and so everything that has equatorial body always has a similar
profile in the base right but this one has like this fermented
fruit that's crisp and warm
laid into that mix and it's when people say exotic you know like
that's that's an exotic it's not screaming loud
it's just screaming fucking good nice and i've never so it's the first time
i've ever grown up and i got her in one of my you know my
gill cali six operation here and um oh i love her i'm like oh you got a
place in the stable forever you are nice and i know that the quality
high is supposed to be devastating that was the whole point the person was like
dude this stuff's gonna tear the top of your fucking head off
there's nobody on it it's just sizzling and so i wanted something to complement
the congo that was similar to that where it had those uptight
high but are workable in a outdoor situation here in southern humboldt
because the stuff that i like you have to put in a greenhouse and take it way
too long and it just doesn't it just doesn't work in real life for
the house
yep no but that mine aren't home yet yep
no that's cool man yeah i wonder uh you know
how it holds up probably holds up on the mountain and stuff like that that's
pretty cool man that's
there's a killing in your area kill it
i'll have to get your car man i'm telling you it
it's a really nice you'll you'll be like oh
got you this is a nice plant she's just got a really good body on her
the flower formation stunning it it's got all the right shit with the
right high in a reasonable time frame
i'm actually popping those um those congo root beers tomorrow is my
plan i'm gonna get it packed up and shipped out to everybody but i'm gonna
pop mine tomorrow and i'm a i'm inspired now i'm gonna
probably gonna throw some something on one of those males onto uh
onto that willie nelson and i'm telling you man and and and
just keep it by itself too because it's something that has like a frightening
high yeah yeah i'll just do i'll just paint it
on so i can have so i can smoke some for sure
yeah no that's the kind of shit you want you want you
you you need the weed that scares you again you don't you don't like walk into
the store and like look around and then turn around and walk out
and you're all afraid yeah yeah you're all nervous
hey i gotta get out of here guys man thanks for the conversation today
hey good good talking to you kev later later
cheers kev take it easy kev speaking of like those scary
kind of like the old school like genetics mountain organics that guy
has some incredible genetics i ran his first lines a couple years ago and
i keep kind of like feeding like through him over time and
there is some beautiful notes and then he's using like uh
um he's using some like ties and afghans and um
oh my god i can't think of the uh yeah using
some good lines anyway yeah i just want to say
you know kev is a class act nice to get to chat with him
kevin actually was the one i don't know if he left the room or not but
he's the one who gave me my start you know selling seeds
and it's a pretty cool story the way that he kind of you know came through
and opened up an opportunity for me to prove myself that way
and he just continues to kind of pay it forward and give it back
the good people what year was that that you you started
you kind of came from that point when you came out to humble but then when did
you kind of what year was it that you turned it
around where we're selling seed uh 2011 because i you know i'd been in
humboldt but i had never been to a dispensary before
you know and uh you know eventually i got my script and
took some time to go to humble patient resource center which at the time had
been operating for 16 years and was one of the longest um operational
you know and you know actually permitted 15
dispensaries and i walk in i'm like i heard you can just walk right in and you
know ask someone about clones and genetics so like oh yeah
just go right there just walk in go talk to kev
and uh you know i had i've been sending some of my
on um on one of the forums when i was on the east coast
and when i when i ended up in humble the guy that i was working with
you know was on the forums as well and basically told me just like go nuts
show everything you know document everything that we're doing our soil
mixes like all the work and uh so i go into kev and uh
introduce myself and chatted with him for a bit and i said hey you know i've
been working reading programs and and so hum and you
know i'd love to kind of show you my seeds and and see
what you think um and i go you know i've been
documenting them online he goes oh yeah i know who you are
and i'm like oh he's like oh yeah you can't you d he's like i seen on there i
know what you're up to you know and uh i was like oh you know
cool that's good dude that's a good that's great
that cranston warwick accent is on point oh yeah baby i'll tell you about it you
know i do a great you know he's actually never heard me do that impression but
so anyway um you know we just kind of hung out
he was super welcoming and in the fall i came back and i brought in a bunch of
baggies and i said this is some flower from the seeds from my 5g's red
and this is from my my og cam you know crosses
and hybrids and he goes you know what he goes i've been
approached by every breeder there is dj short
shanty baba you know the cali connection you know everybody
he goes you're the first one that's ever come in here giving me
some flowers and said the seeds grow this this is what the seeds grow
and he's like those other guys you know they have these these legendary
reputations but he goes i'm selling clones and to people in
humboldt county if i give somebody in humboldt who's
supporting their family and their livelihood is is what they grow and i
give them some shit they're gonna come and they're gonna be
pissed and i don't want to do that to people he goes you're the first one
that said this is what the seeds grow so he's like yeah no problem
so i started you know just getting little plastic dime bags and i'd hand
write on a little scrap piece of paper with my
messy handwriting and just put it in the bag and just bring
in these packs of seeds and had a handwritten menu you can google
on orange rebel seeds it pulls up in the
images you can see my handwritten seed menu and the pricing
and it was great because people bought them nobody in humboldt could buy seeds
you know csi he was selling seeds on the internet
you know there was there was no actual seed company in humboldt that was selling
the dispensaries and what was what was great is that the
results started coming back from southern humble farmers northern humble
farmers these guys were really skeptical to buy
seeds at a dispensary you know most of the growers that i knew
at that time did not have a 215 license you know they get their genetics from
their friends who say my buyers will pay you the most money for this stuff
and so you know that's that's how i got my start is people being really stoked
with what they found and coming back and saying let me get
let me get more of those and when he opened up in wonderland it was perfect
because then he was in southern humble and i could just come down the hill and
kick it and i would go and sell other people's
seeds you know i knew all the breeders on the menu
and i would just like kind of act like i worked there and you know give people
weed and you know be like oh what are you looking to grow and i'd be like oh
well you want this from this company he's got a really great thing for that
you know but yeah great guy
that's cool man um it's i've actually you're in pushing my my thinking forward
a little bit um i've been recently just kind of like
going in my head like where where's this landing for me
you know is the in the years to come and do i
actually want to have an on-site nursery that people can just like drop
by and come to and buy seeds and buy clones
and um i think that's what i what i want to
do it's not we're not quite there yet uh with legally in washington for me to do
that but um i can sell seeds legally but but
going forward it just it does sound very appealing to be able to
connect directly to people um as well as online but you know through that but
but to face to face and and have that interaction have that that
conversations because often people could just get caught up in names you know i
used to be really into the snowboard industry
and um you know i'd work at a shop you know the biggest shops in the
country they'd we'd have hundreds of snowboards and people would come in and
be i want this one you're like no dude well tell me about what you what you're
doing you know and actually you might get yeah i might get the
results you're looking for with this one over here and it's a little bit cheaper
you know and um anyways i've been just saying you're
inspiring me is what i'm trying to say well i miss that same part of uh the
like 215 days man we used to run clones through there but
being able to interact with each person on a personal level and
offer them something based on what they were literally looking for
not just some name they had heard about and shit
i miss that so much man we used to run 10 hours a day doing that stuff every
seven days a week
yep and yo that's what i want to do now you know it's like
i wish i could travel around going to all these fucking seed expos
and just being behind the booth like after a while i got burnt out and i
would like not even be behind my own booth the whole
day but i miss those days of on your feet
10 hours straight you meet so many cool people and then you see the same cool
people every year i wish i could just track
sell seeds all over the country yep yeah i miss that stuff yeah if we
could just do farmers markets and seeds then just be normal like that man the
dream man with our children's children bro but like
that's i think that would make everybody happy or most people happy if we could
just you know just do that everywhere man you
know just showcase what you got you know is anybody using micro propagation to be
able to have genetic backup for your gear
not me man i wish i had access to that where i'm at
and in my condition i can't even get close to anything doing that
some of the other guys are in bigger cities you guys can do that stuff though
some of you should be trying it or getting around to it
yeah i haven't figured it out um or put the time in so shame on me for that
i i um it's very expensive to hire it out
um but um i i've leaned towards just having a big greenhouse to hold
everything in so unfortunately i don't i think it's
the future of cannabis to be able to keep genetic stock because when it comes
to propagation you can just blow it out the
water and you're able to once you get your numbers up in a tissue
culture setting you're just able to have that clean
genetic stock being able to move forward and you know that's the gold
standard with all of ag it's only you know cannabis that that micro
propagation is this new technology but you know i i think that for me it's a
way to be able to have that genetic backup because you can
give your gear out to as many people as possible but what happens if
you have a fire what happens if you have a tornado you have an earthquake that
everybody gets wiped out just like that um versus having like a bank like we
were talking about earlier where that way you can
have your gear you know stocked or have that Noah's Ark so that way you can bank
you know everything for a timeless event i believe it's the future too um
and i'm the proof what you're talking about of losing genetics it's happened
to me two times where i've lost everything in my garden
from some particular reason and the next thing you know i don't have any way to
back it up because i was one of the old cats that didn't want to share everything
in my garden because uh there was a value on the plant of one form or
another be it a medical or um a value of dollar wise so i
didn't want to pass specific cuts to certain people because of what they were
doing and i didn't want to pass my breeding
stock to people because the amount of time i had put into it but
what it comes down to is when they're gone and you can't get them back
and they had specific abilities to pass traits
having to dig through a large population of plants to once again do
that unless you can start with the parental stock
you pretty much shit out of luck and that's we
we as a guard as a group should try to get over that we should
figure out a way to have micro propagation where you can get tissue
cultures we need cats like what dutch is saying
and what i used to do run and clone facilities that have verifiable cuttings
that you can grow every time you come in there they're going to be the same
they're not going to throw some weird wacky shit at you
they're just going to tell you they're in stock or they're not in stock when you
try to come get them in if we don't start doing that stuff and
acting more like other companies out there and
other agricultural divisions of plants like dudes with
tomatoes aren't fucking around like we do in the cannabis community
same thing with people growing pineapples or any other vegetable only
us have decided that it's more important to pass along some
story with that's in the past same plant repeatedly over and over
verifiable to people so they can grow what they need to grow
yeah i'm definitely looking at the systems
yo man i i feel you on everything you just said tony especially that
heartbreak of losing real special plants you know over and over and over and over
again and you know hoping that you can find
them in a large plant population of previous generation or whatever but yeah
the micro propagation man is is you know going to be evolving quickly
and you know as growers we have constant you know threats
every single you know couple years a new thing um
you know plant viruses that are you know going to be
very um just unstoppable without early you know
protection of genetics through through that unless everything is in-house
and right now a lot of technology is expensive and
a lot of the people who have dialed those things in other industries
you know having quite transitioned into the proper amount of r and d that needs
to be done with cannabis to figure out uh the most suitable approaches you know
specifically for cannabis but it's important man because we can't
lose our most prized and special you know individual plants
yep well hey everybody i gotta um peace out but um thanks for uh having
me on peter and thanks for the good conversation everybody
it was nice hanging out for sure later joshua josh
thanks josh and we got a man who's normally
not lacking for words doc ray up on the stage doc
uh you want to go back to the beginning of the conversation and talk about kind
of what you've kept around for a long long time
hey peter good to see everybody this evening
man you know i'm breaking out a bunch of old stuff that i hadn't played with for
a long time this last year because of that everybody
you know land race and uh old school breeding genetics and a little
building block stuff so as you know brother i've been a fan of
the blueberry for decades and the whites forever in a day but i just
pulled out something i haven't played with in a long time which is a
74 hippie trail afghani kamirah pass that people haven't probably ever seen
for at least 30 years i dug that genetics out of the ice box
and dusted it off and brought it back this year and it's
phenomenal you know it's that old school uh
afghani and if you haven't smelled it before ladies and gentlemen because it
hasn't been around forever it used to be called cat piss you know and it
smells straight on afghani freaking cat piss so that's really a cool
plant that i'd like to play with right now peter and
you know i'm being a fan of the razzleberry kush forever in a day it's
kind of our old legacy one of our old genetics and i like playing with that
still and you know and then people don't get to see that very often that true
double purple double indica that was built right here in humboldt county 30
years ago and that plant you know is in a lot of the cool stuff that's out on
the market now everything from the blueberry muffin to a lot of other the
cool genetics that are here in the triangle right now they are their
chops to that fucking plant that the guy that created that plant's been a dead
for 11 years that nobody's ever going to get to spend any time with you know so
those are the things that i like playing with right now brother you know i've got
a couple of new things i'm
doing some full thc high thc high cbd's or cbs genetics right now i've been
playing with a lot of with a buddy of mine here for the last three or four
years we're playing with some really really cool stuff that's taking some of
the old school like the afghani 74 and crossing it with the harlequin for
example in the suzy q a couple two different crosses that we're playing
right now with our full hopefully going to have some real cool medical value
down the road but kind of like what kevin was talking to and you know dutch
and anthony and you know matt and every and even mojave left but everybody's up
here you know a lot of us we've been doing this for a really long time and
you know before it was ever hip or cool we were still doing this thing breeding
stock and to think some of these old breeders or old growers are on around
anymore to tell call them geneticists or breeders they would just laugh at us you
know because they were just farmers reproducing seeds like i think it might
have been anthony said you know we just want to have seeds man so you're
reproducing seed stock so you had fresh seed for the next year they didn't even
consider themselves to be what we would consider prioner craft breeders in this
industry now and most of them are old men and women and they're either a lot
of them are dead and gone now so to try and protect that legacy and to teach out
and share out the information even as kevin was talking about you know take the
from one generation and telling the stories of where it came from so we can try and put you
know credit where credit is due and also help to establish some legacy of where
things come from here in the triangle because i'm not sure i think maybe it was dan and he's
gone but you know he's talking about you know when you're talking earlier about you know where
you just went sit down with somebody you know and we smoked for an afternoon or you know we'd
sit down and broke bread and you know okay man you like hey man here's some seeds of what i'm
doing you know and it you know and when i went to see dan you know it wasn't it didn't it wasn't
some fancy ass name it i literally wrote on the back dan siege you know and then like i say that
because like old dave you know nobody knew who the fuck old dave was you know other than
the reputation in the triangle and then those genetics were part of what's all in the corners
of all this stuff that everybody's playing with now and i'm hoping that this new technology
because i'm in the i'm part of that group that's in the beta test for the freaking blockchain thing
here if anybody in the triangle wants to find out about the canopy rights deal contact me
outside of this and i can dial you in on that but that's basically uh being hosted by
humble grace it's a collaboration between hendrix farms and myself and the sohum seed collective and
a bunch of other breeders and growers in the triangle here that do this to start this program
and it's it's pretty simple too ladies and gentlemen because i've done ip work and i've
patented stuff over the last few years and before you jump on me as open seed source you're born
after 1980s before you were fucking born so don't get on my case about patent and genetics right now
but what i'm saying is is this allows us to be able to create a a sequence of documented chains
where somebody can literally because in a nutshell as you the breeder puts a leaf into a
evidence bag that's time sealed and dated and photographed and that information is filed
on the blockchain with canopy rights and now you literally have a time stamp it's time
sample when this all started brothers and sisters and i literally asked the guy that's the lawyer
writing this stuff yesterday because i've done patent work and said i just want to know one thing
does your blockchain time stamp beat my genetics patents in a court of law if and this was a
scenario that i put to him was if someone comes you know i give you something and someone comes
and after the fact that i've got this filed and they go hey man we we got patent on your stuff we
own your your gear does my time stamp trump you in a court of law and he assures me that it will
this is free ladies and gentlemen you know all you got to do is put a leaf in a
evidence bag and take a photograph of it and file the paperwork it's just time energy and
effort there isn't tens of thousands of dollars or more that has to be invested plus your time
to be able to protect your gear i'm hoping this is a viable path
that technology coming into play and again i'm part of the beta test here in the triangle if
you're a breeder and you want to be a part of it you cannot be out of the state of california
we're really trying to work within the triangle because it's just the logistic nightmare of
dealing with people outside the immediate area this becomes even more complicated but we're looking for
you know i'm saying this to anthony and dan and matt and chase and tyler and we're looking for
another you know 10 or so more breeders to get involved in this program so if you gentlemen are
interested please reach out to me i can try and dial you in on that i'm gonna shut up here i
didn't get enough pollen off of me i've been breeding all day is that why i wasn't talking
earlier is actually in the greenhouse doing a little back breeding listening to this conversation
so i'm actively in it today big boy doc ray humboldt county outlaw shutting the fuck up
right on doc ray it's been a minute since i've been up in humboldt myself
hey doc i don't live in california but i definitely would like to learn more about
the block changes because i agree that that's definitely going to be the the future
um of cannabis and i definitely want to be on the the cutting edge of being able to learn about that
because where i'm operating i i'm almost in a state where we have no barriers to entry so i'm
seeing what happens firsthand in a new state where you have a low skill set overall um jumping in
and every tom dick and harry that has a warehouse of you know a shed a basement can be commercial
operators but we all know that you know there's a difference between growing for medical purposes
versus actually doing it at scale and the challenges that come with that but at the same
time we're also seeing a race to the bottom and you literally see everybody working the same gear
here in this state and i would say that oklahoma is probably about three years behind what's kind
of cool on the the west coast as far as what's vogue what's hip what people are breeding with
um which is really funny to me because you know we're starting to see a lot of uh you know runts
crosses here now we're starting to see people messing with mac and stuff of that nature which
goes back to still putting us into a certain category with some of these genetics and i prefer
to have the diversity where you know not everything is deserted um you know i like being
able to have something that's that has almost all of my terpene profiles covered so that way i can
kind of dive in and play around with things that are are unique and not like putting me into one
category or box you know i think a lot of what you said it's just such a shame that everybody is
growing so much of their genetics all based off of very similar very related gene pools and it's
great you know that the people are able to do well but i think the sad thing about today is that a
lot of people who are newer to smoking weed didn't have a proper education on what good weed is
because all they had is what is currently in the market and i mean there's amazing weed ever for
sure but everywhere but just seeing the gelato and the sherb and we mentioned the do-si crosses
like there's so much stuff with the cookies heritage in it which makes some beautiful you
know plants but man there's some really amazing spectrums of cannabis that a lot of people don't
know about and i think that because there's so much scale of production especially in california
you know it's it's hard to grow incredible like not just normal but special memorable weed when
you have to grow so much of it and so it's you have to search out you know when i was younger
that was the goal in life i'm gonna have the best weed i gotta find who's got the best weed how am i
gonna meet that person oh shit i'm gonna grow weed well i want to grow the best weed how am i gonna
grow the best weed i gotta learn how to do that i gotta find the best genetics a lot of that is
lost and instead of people finding that way on their own they're just gravitating towards what
they're told to like which is not necessarily always the best or that good um you know anyway
that's me being stone and ranting a bit you're not off of it brother honestly i just had a buddy of
mine come back from hall of flowers and he's rolling with my flower you know and he literally
said i just got a bag full of bland weed big boy except for you man and his old lady won't smoke
anything else but me you know and my friends up here and we're just small you know little
cultivators doing our thing we're not big corporate cannabis we're independents you know i'm licensed
and permitted but i'm just a little fucking guy in a big-ass pond you know and it's like
i just am hopeful that we stay this course you know this thing i was down in soham out in white
thorn on monday at the collective and you know it's lawrence ringo's group brothers and sisters
and if y'all don't know who that is that's ringo's gift or the guy that gave us charlotte's web which
is one of the most prominent cb rich genetics on the planet and you know lawrence has been gone for
six seven years now and it's just what do we do guys you know and i mean that ladies and gentlemen
what do we do collectively are we just going to continue to settle for mediocre bland flower and
what dan alluded to there's so many unique profiles out there that are so complex and so beautiful and
flavorful and have such a tremendous effects that the average consumer doesn't even get to try and
like i'm encouraging all my brothers and sisters here in the triangle man is to you know especially
the medical ones i've never really i haven't thrown down in a competition in 23 years man you
know and take one of my medical flowers and went over to nevada in july and gotten all kinds of
shit for it but come back with a first place trophy man you know and again to meet my medical
brothers and sisters here it's like look we can compete in this in this commercial market with
our flowers we have a really unique one-of-a-kind things we can compete you know so that's kind of
been my driving force for the last two or three four years now of trying to how do we get how do
we come from being really good at what we do but you can't get any kind of footing into the game
because you're just bombarded with so many brands that have so much capital and scratch that they
can do shit you just can't do by promoting their flower and the truth of it is it doesn't hold a
candle to what i do or what anthony or dan you know bro i've seen your work man i know what you
do you know it's like they don't hold the candle to us 90 percent of the time it's just not even
in the same realm and get my guys you know my buddy's a big influencer in the cannabis game
he's down there at this big event it's a very expensive event that most of my friends aren't
even in there at because they can't afford the 750 admission price to go to the damn thing and
booze brothers and sisters are as cheap booth as 6500 fucking dollars well how does a small
cultivator compete in that they can't so they get completely looped out of these big events hence
they miss exposure to the market it's a real tough time for a lot of small cultivators that are real
true craft heirloom people to compete you know and we're all this group up here man we're actually up
there we're out there fighting it and doing it you know we're the we're the fringe that's actually
trying to do it where the most of them are just standing there watching us and not having much
success so the only reason i'm saying it guys i've been dealing with it for two solid weeks
it's just this threat of genetics and how do we bring all this old stuff forward and how do we
preserve it and this is just real relevant peter for what the conversation was otherwise my butt
would be sitting on the couch getting high right now so doc shut now well you know man you know i'm
just gonna do what i always did which was do whatever i want you know i'm just gonna start
selling people seeds and hooking people feeds up because you know the the legal cannabis it is what
it is you know there's there's a lot you got to do there and i don't know man depressing
seeing the pricing go down and it's like people work so fucking hard to grow amazing weed and
you know it's it's going to be an interesting year it's going to be an interesting couple years
for for small farmers for sure you know who don't have a lot of savings you know this is kind of
that time where you know a lot of people their their operating costs and overhead is going to be
you know more than their fucking you know gross revenue let alone net revenue for people who are
not super efficient so this is a time where growers need to look at every detail of what
they're doing and see where they can become more efficient on their production style and you know
it's it's cost it's labor while not cutting the corners with quality inputs and you know things
that are going to grow a good product because it's it's going to get real tough for a while
and uh you know i suppose you know it used to be if you had incredible genetics you know that would
get recognized pretty quickly um but now if people haven't heard of it you have to build your own
demand for that and this is a very challenging time to do that because you know the cost of
you know or barrier of entry and having a brand is a fucking a lot you know and the established
brands don't care if you have something amazing if their buyers at the trendy you know retails
don't want it so shit is gonna be fucking you know tough times but um yeah i just i'm gonna go back
and sell people seeds and hook up seeds bro literally just laughing my ass on dad i literally
just went through that i'm gonna got a bunch of big negotiations right now and i have a guy literally
said what you said man as much as i love it old old man my market is telling me they will not
touch it and we have to go with what they'll touch and i just kind of shook my head it's like you
guys are just literally we've spent weeks talking about this you guys have been talking about this
plant for fucking two months of trying to move forward with it and that's just how brutal it is
ladies and gentlemen it's a really really tough time right now in this game to try and move forward
with genetics that as dan is alluding to but i'm gonna even tell you one even more so i'm literally
with one of the legends here in soham and he's showing me some og fires bros that has got the
coa on it and a little under 33 total sum okay this is some serious serious first grade so cow
so i'm fire right first off he can't get an offer of more than 250 a pound on it and what is it
missing brothers and sisters it doesn't have any freaking purple in it now the buyers aren't even
opening the bags ladies and gentlemen they're not even open the bag and i said good god they're not
even opening the bag to my buddy and he said dude they didn't even look at it they looked at it and
didn't see purple in it they just bypassed the whole bin i said well open one up man and he opened
i smelled freaking hindu og before man i mean it's full on freaking fuel man that literally
makes your eyes water when you open the back and i was like good god bro man are you kidding me man
i can take it now where in the world did california red-haired sensimillion fall out of
favor i just you know that's the part that blows me away this plant had no got no red in it anthony
but it's california red hair sensimillion bro and it's fucking gorgeous and nobody's even looking
at it and they're literally offering what dan said ladies and gentlemen the taxes is 150 fucking
dollars where's their money at 250 man so anyway it's coming down to uh the packaging it's it's
all in a small little glass jar now that's inside a cardboard box that's sold across to you from the
shelf you can't smell it you can't touch it you can only visually see it now and so the only thing
you got is the color that's shining through the little clear spot on the package and the numbers
they stamp on the back and that's what people are going off these days and they're too young
to understand what real good cannabis is it ain't isn't it's not just about what it looks like in
the bag sometimes the most swaggy looking weed is the best stuff you're gonna smoke the whole
weekend man for sure like you talked about cat pissy afghanis some of the least dense uh some
of the worst bag of pill but best smoking weed ever had was some afghani cat pissy herb that just
drop you to your knees right but most people ain't gonna buy it because it doesn't look good
in the jar on the package on the shelf straight up bro i mean seriously straight up that is and
that's how silly it is i mean honestly you know and i'm an old school guy so when you came to the
farm you know back in the day you came up you rolled up to our turf man you know we sat down
at the table with you and it wasn't you weren't looking at bags we had you know jars of everything
of what we had produced that year out and as you were the buyer you got to sit sit and sample and
look at all of it touch it squeeze it feel it smell it eat it whatever the fuck you wanted to
do you know while you were making your decisions and what anthony's talking about because i don't
really run this realm and a lot of the guys on this panel we don't run that realm you know we're
on the other end we're producing the stuff so i hadn't been in a dispenser in a couple years
gentlemen i walked in and i was stunned you couldn't even find a flower that was what anthony
said it wasn't that wasn't sealed in a bubble plaque or in a pack or in a fucking jar or in a
box or a bag or something there was no fresh bud for the consumer to get a visual on the thing or
much less open a jar of old school you know old school medical 215 days you guys know i'm talking
about you walk into the dispensary and there were literally gallon jars on the shelf behind the bud
tender and they'd pull the jars down and let you smell and look you know feel touch taste drive the
whole nine yards before you made your decision that's all gone away in the last 15 years and i
think it's a true disservice to the industry i think it's a real disservice to the end consumer
because they don't get to experience like well what i'm dealing with my orange cream frost man
it smokes like a citrus bowl with gasoline and it's just gorgeous but it's a sativa forward but
you know what i mean bro it's a light bud man when you smoke it you sit down smoke a joint of it
and shut up you know give it 20 minutes and see what the fuck you think now that's where this
flower just it destroyed people i literally had people going dude it don't look like anything
compared to all this and indoor indica this is big i took big virginia full bud sun bud you know
what i mean it was big ass fucking fluffy bud you know so i took that with me and it took first man
but why because the profile was so unique compared to everything else they were out that i was
competing against what anthony said man you know big fluffy bud does it have bag of bill not really
you know yes it does but it doesn't in comparison to these rock hard little indoor indica flowers
that everybody's so accustomed to seeing so anyway doc shot
i ran a club sorry go ahead chase no i was going to say that i i would like to see cannabis uh
sold by how many weeks it takes to flower something out versus you know everything
being geared towards production i mean just think about how many cultivars that we're leaving
you know on the on the table still just because we have to put you know a eight week or under
life span on that plant or most people don't want to be growing it in a commercial setting
you know that's why a lot of people went with a lot of afghani just to be able to cut down some
of that equatorial time that it took to be able to you know flower out some of those cultivars that
were 12 plus weeks for me i would love to see you know some of the 16 18 week flowers but
nobody grows them unless it's at really really small craft batch levels and then it turns into
you know who do you know at that point that's growing it for head stash because it's just like
fine wine or cigars that doesn't leave that circle you know that it's in it's who you're
connected to and and who has accessibility to you within that harvest time because you know
it comes and it goes and that's the reason why i like to run a lot of the same gear which i've
i've crossed everything that i have into itself and i make more seeds but at the same time you
know i can't even work all of my own shit let alone trying to acquire anyone's genetics which
you know i look at everybody's you know sites and i'm like man that looks really interesting i want
to go that way but then at the same time it's like fuck you know i have you know 200 different
cultivars that i'm waiting to work myself that i'm never going to be able to select through
so i feel sometimes you know the hunt is almost more important than the actual catch
well that's where we can all come together from grower to patient to breeder to even the guys
that are housing the cuttings in the micro propagation status so you end up with guys
that have provenance in the community that are holding specific cultivars that that can be now
added to the the blockchain and used in the gene stock and micro propagation so this is added with
provenance with a story it gives the history of the plant as far as we know it the names that can
be mentioned are the ones that can't are just not mentioned they're not as important as the actual
proof that the plant is what the plant is it can be entered by multiple folks that have no
connection to the mother plant that offered them like say i'm the guy that's passing clone a and
everybody here sends in a copy of it but they didn't get it from me somehow they got their clone
through some other person that may or may not have got it from me but it's supposedly the cut
that i carry around right we send that in to chase chases runs the dna sequencing on it
takes micro propagations of each one of the cuttings that way we have a copy of them
the plants that come back as duplicates of each other now are marked in the system in case uh
we want to pass those along to folks right we can now copy each one of those repeatedly and be passed
to people they're going to have a specific chemovar status for particular breeding projects
particular commercial grows whatever the purpose be that those plants will now have um the provenance
to do what we say they're going to do and now by doing that we run that through patients that are
trained smokers right not that we train them but they've trained themselves through uh medicinal
purposes of using particular uh cultivars that they were told was this or that over a certain
amount of time they've trained their own palate to uh recognize what's happening with their own
system like kevin says with pure kush cut that he has that plant has a great uh ability to handle uh
like he said spasms and such i use it myself with my um uh my ghost pains with my leg here that
plant's been in my garden since i've had the plant here since i lost my leg i use it specifically for
that and then breed it into other lines to see if i can keep retaining that into a progeny so i
can do back crosses to it when i find what i'm looking for so if we teach the breeders what to
look for and the people that are smoking what to look for instead of just showing them pretty
pictures and stuff and we can go back to 2 15 day styles where a person can touch and smell it
and they can automatically tell what the terpene profile the plant is they don't have to read it
in a book they they don't understand what terpene is that they don't know what my siren is but they
know what they like orange smelling plants with the sharp lemon back note to it that have a real
musky scent and they can pick that up by touching the plant that's why the old jars that we used to
have in our club they were uh herb that we didn't sell to you but you were allowed to touch it and
smell it and see it and then we go in the back and get you fresh weed right you weren't getting
anything that everyone else was touching their hands on so you'd get some chopsticks you'd be
able to smell it you'd be able to see what happens when it's a disturbed terpene profile that comes
off the plant and that's gone away from what's happened with commercial cannabis now now it's
just about the package the cartoon that's on the front of it the funny name and like how much you
spent on it that's that's where that's where it went and the numbers how high of a number can the
plants specifically say it has for and like nobody's nobody's decided yet that they're
going to agree that the higher the number does not i mean jack shit for the pump yeah man i
sorry i didn't know if i was at my service but yeah man i feel you on everything you said and
you know i was i was thinking you know i i wish i had more positive things that i was saying about
the current state of things that i'm sometimes i'm like damn i i sound like some grumpy person
complaining about you know the cannabis industry and it's it's not that you know it's like there
are a lot of really amazing things and positive things that you know are are coming and emerging
every single day but the reason i got into weed was to have a balanced lifestyle right it was
about me finding my balance about what's going to make me the happiest and the healthiest
and pursue my you know my dreams and you know small batch organic growing is what i got into
it for and right when i started getting real real good at that and i was able to get into breeding
all of a sudden i had to grow so much weed you know when you're growing so so much weed okay
it's it's fun and it's rewarding and the experience that you get in the intuition that it builds is
incredible but it takes away from this balance of your life and what what they did in california
with the way that they did you know all the the 64 licensing is you know obviously as we all know
the the you know the production is just so out of control and it's just you know i guess i sound
grumpy complaining about it but imagine if they had just limited people to small cultivators that
you know had an acre each and people from the 215 era if they met the qualifications could grow
their fucking acre of weed or you know whatever it is there wouldn't be this massive overproduction
and everybody would have had to be focused on making quality but you know it's it's just hard
to have balance when you have to go so hard and that's what i've seen happen every year in
california you know since i got there everybody's just going harder and harder it's like what
happened to like going fishing on a sunday you know or like what happened to finding time to
hang out with your buddies you know what i've seen is that in order to make it you just got
to give everything and you can you never turn off the gas you just got to keep going you know no
matter what and i'm i'm a small producer you know i've got just over 30 000 square feet that's
nothing and it's not even flat so then i picture people running these huge businesses the giant
fucking companies and you know multiple 10 acre sites and 30 acre sites it's like that's just not
fun for me you know like i can't i could never picture balancing my life in any way that's
meaningful or fun if i had to go that hard to be good at business and work you know so i'm i'm
hoping to find a way to be an organic farmer and not worry about how much i produce just make sure
that it's really fucking special and find time to breeding and it's not easy you know i got fucking
i owe humboldt county a bunch of money in the state of california a bunch of money and all this
shit they make it almost fucking impossible you know so trying to keep my confidence high and keep
bobbing and weaving throwing a good left hook you know keep it going yeah i'll never understand
how lacing the stacking kind of slid through and became the it's mind-blowing peter i'm stuck and
honest to god brothers and sisters yo it's shit if y'all know what kind of bills dan and i pay
for fees and fucking taxes or anybody else in this state that does it above board man bro you know
and i'm where you're at we've got 10 000 feet and it's complicated as fuck all man i can't imagine
trying to run you know a half a million or a million feet it just takes all the fun out of it
completely it becomes you know it becomes corporate agriculture and i think that's where we
hopefully in the triangle we where we can excel as we kind of get that because i saw mendo thank
god they're kind of embracing that now they looped all the small mom and pops out of menecino county
over the last seven eight ten years and now they're you know coming back and realize this is
a fucking mistake they're opening changing those rules it's happening here they pushed everybody
out here with abatements over the previous decade of all these small 215 cultivators with 64 that
couldn't meet compliance and ladies and gentlemen it was stupid stuff like your road isn't wide
enough but you're three miles back into the mountain the county wants you to widen your road
two feet for three fucking miles that's how stupid some of these abatements were you know or
a lot of it was water and access was the bulk of how they pinned people down and pushed them out
that was a mistake this county has realized they've come back in the last 24 months there's
literally millions and millions and millions of dollars of grant money here now to help small
cultivators if they're still here to fix some of these stupid problems like widening your road for
three fucking miles or you know bringing in 25 000 gallons of water tanks up the side of a mountain
all this other stuff that was really prohibitive cost wise and manpower wise for a lot of small mom
and pops this county and humbled is at least trying to make an effort to change some of that with
grants and low interest loans and all kinds of stuff to try and help them get it to be able to
get back in the game i just truly believe and i'm damn it you know you know you're here where i'm at
too man you know i think our neighborhood we control like 80 of the finest genetics in the
world here and i think that is our our golden ticket for a lot of small cultivators that they
can't compete growing pounds or growing flour but they can compete by producing seeds and branding
out and things like that so doc ray shutting up i'm gonna step out uh my dinner is ready so i'm
taking an exit stage right thank you brothers and sisters have a good evening thanks doc
to the top thanks yeah man the county shit is crazy i i was hearing you know to actually get
my annual county permit like two weeks ago and it's so funny because you know in 2016
the county passed their commercial ordinance which was crazy i mean humboldt county all of a sudden
has a commercial cannabis cultivation ordinance i mean who would have thought that would ever even
happen and uh the first step was to send in a letter of intent hi my name is this guy i live
here here's my parcel number here's how much square footage i want to grow or have currently
growing pre-existing 2016 boom boom boom here's here's me and then you got to send that in so i
was one of the first people to submit it in 2016 it didn't feel good life has never really felt
that great since to be honest but uh you know 2016 and here we are in 2021 two weeks ago i just
got the permit and what was so funny it's you know because of covid it's on on zoom so there's
this like public zoom hearing and i'm listening to these people review my whole application
and truthfully it was a lot easier than i thought the whole time i'm like shit and i paid so many
people so much money i could have done this i could have communicated these things but
yeah man there's there's a lot of a lot of hurdles that's why it's important to
definitely read the language and to understand the governing body for your area um you know
being in oklahoma just seeing the complete opposite day and night what you guys have to face
in california versus here where you know there's some counties that have no building codes so as
long as you don't blow yourself up you're able to do whatever the hell you want to and that's
even at the extraction level as well um so it's definitely almost scary to to know what's going on
in some of these operations that i've been in but where do you guys feel is is necessary to be able
to stay relevant once this federal bail opens up and allows interstate commerce to happen and for
states to uh you know have the ability to move products from one to another i know i've been
talking a lot so i'll just say something quick and then i actually got to bounce but yeah i mean
that's a really good question you know eventually it is going to open up and if you have something
special to offer and people do know about it and are going to want it you may have access to direct
consumer and a lot of people are really hoping that i would say you know like i'm no no real
expert these are my opinions but my opinion is just think about when you were younger you first
started getting weed you know if you were not one of the best in those circles and when you finally
started growing and you met people if you were not one of the best in those circles and if you
haven't always made one of your life goals to improve and be the best at what you're doing
it's going to be really hard to have any value it's about how good you really are and then about
who you know and what's behind you and so it's it's really hard for people who are not already
active or brands that are currently not on shelves there's always room for new things to enter if they
can be better than other people more unique have something to offer but i always tell people that
who are looking to get into canvas but people who are already in cannabis if we can stand out now
and we can show people something special provide not just value in a product in community but also
entertainment all the things that we can do to enrich with cannabis boom i think that's what
it's going to take to have people in different states be like yeah i want that delivered to
my house and i'll pay a little bit more for it this shit is fire but anyway i'm i'm gonna run
uh peter thanks for letting me come up and speak it's you guys and everybody has a great night
peace thanks dan take it easy dan marcus you uh have anything to to add
it's my first time on clubhouse man so can you hear me we can all right cool cool it was
it was just i'm glad i took i'm glad i took your virginity right right hey they've been they've been
telling me to get on i just didn't have a good enough reason yet i try to stay away from you
know as much phone as i possibly can so i you know what i mean like even instagram like i try to not
engage as you know as least as possible here to live life you know i mean in reality at any rate
uh no i just i you know i cut in probably like mid mid time it was just good to hear you know i
don't know a lot of the people on there but it was just good to hear people you know preaching
the same stuff and just just saying a bunch of good and i mean like good information you know
um i mean i mean other than yeah i mean yeah that you know i kind of live in both worlds i work for
a large distributor you know in the prop 64 market but my roots come from you know the
traditional market um so i you know i understand both perspectives especially just being like a
small-time guy just doing my thing at you know at home um and then you know now now doing breeding
and just just having fun with it and uh i don't know if anything just just encourage people just
to keep doing what you love you know uh luckily my you know my financial situation doesn't hinge
on anything you know weed related so it's just pure passion like that that's you know i'm not
doing it because i need the money i do it uh because i just love doing it and just just
encourage people just keep doing it uh for that reason alone you know at minimum so the initial
conversation where we're having was kind of what genetics have you kept long term in your library
and why can you talk about that yeah you know it's it's funny um i i think i even sort of have
a different perspective which is i try i try not to like hold on to things or like keep things
you know close to the vest per se um i try to share is yeah i feel like a lot of times
like what i'm giving out is like the stuff that i love you know i'm just not like kind of throwing
stuff together and releasing it like i'm doing these projects because this is what i like and
i've just given out to the world like i don't i don't really try to hold on to any clones or seeds
like you know and not give it to anybody i think the whole point is giving it out to people because
i think what i'm breeding is a reflection of myself and you know my 20 plus years of being
trying to be a connoisseur and knowledge and everything like that like i want to give out
like i want the seeds and the end product uh be be a reflection of my passion and just again the
there's the time and energy i've spent you know uh i put into weed and just just just all that
stuff so yeah i don't know i don't i i mean i don't like have stuff in the stable that i'll
never release or like anything like that like man it's like everything's for sale it doesn't
it doesn't matter i don't i try not to look at it let let let me rephrase the question it's not
about keeping it close to the best of guarding just kind of what what do you find important to
keep so that you and by keep i don't mean like not from other people i just mean like you have
it on hand and available so that if you want to work with it it's always there to work with
uh probably like right now i think like the kind of uh like probably on the top of my
list there's probably a couple but on top of it probably like the kc36 um like i want to keep
some variation of that around for sure and always like work with it and see what kind of new twist
i can come up with uh so you know that that originally stems from higher ground um so i
originally messed with like their bat cross three and then now i just did a project with their sour
candy which is sour diesel times kc36 but something kc36 related um because there's a lot of like
fruity goodness in that line you know anything from like guava to like tropical blueberries to
stuff like that i like the effect of the smoke it's a very like kind of calming um you know i
think it helps with like anxiety and things of that nature um so you know i i think from a medicinal
aspect too like i really like it jace any uh any last questions or comments as i'm cooking chicken
on the barbecue nope uh i actually was just getting the uh the look from the the wife she
actually is uh cooking dinner for us this evening so i'm about to bounce off of here as well um this
has been a a super interesting uh topic and i feel the unfortunate thing with cannabis is that the
the most educated people about cannabis are usually the ones that never talk to the end
consumer um and the bud tenders are the ones that that need the most education but you know it turns
into a you know what's hip what's vogue you know and what's what's cool um so i i just always like
to hear people trying to educate others and uh doing their part to be able to uh push the industry
towards a uh a more diverse industry that's going to uh reflect you know the the good attributes of
cannabis and not just numerics um that's what concentrates are for um but that's my little rant
and i'm out all right well thank you everyone i gotta finish cooking dinner for the kids but it
was an awesome conversation and uh tomorrow night we have some hash conversations nice
and then the next night we have some knf conversations and anyway this is
