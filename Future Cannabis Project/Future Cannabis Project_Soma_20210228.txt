[00:00.440 --> 00:05.640]  And we are live good morning everyone I can smell the excitement
[00:17.260 --> 00:19.880]  Hey, how's it going everybody welcome to week 21
[00:20.660 --> 00:24.800]  We have one of my favorite people in the whole world on today
[00:24.800 --> 00:29.460]  His name is Soma if you haven't heard of him, you should probably look him up
[00:29.460 --> 00:32.900]  But we're gonna learn a lot about him today. Thank you for coming on Soma
[00:35.640 --> 00:37.640]  Did he freeze up
[00:38.960 --> 00:40.960]  Did I freeze up
[00:42.200 --> 00:49.840]  Yep, how's it going Soma? It's going good. You know, it's these are exciting times we're in
[00:50.920 --> 00:54.680]  Just as far as survival goes just as far as survival goes man
[00:54.680 --> 01:00.640]  I mean like I've been here over 25 years and I'm in a lockdown here curfew
[01:01.120 --> 01:03.120]  You have a curfew there
[01:03.280 --> 01:08.120]  No, we don't have a curfew for say like they do in Europe, but you know, we had restaurants closed
[01:08.120 --> 01:11.680]  They just started opening for outdoor dining about a week ago here in the Bay Area
[01:12.320 --> 01:16.760]  Like I know you're a cook. So, you know restaurant stuff and cooks and I
[01:17.280 --> 01:23.320]  Know a lot of restaurants here. They're freaking out. They're about to close. They can't they can't
[01:24.080 --> 01:30.480]  They can't do it with only takeout and it just doesn't make pay the rent man pay the pay the workers
[01:31.800 --> 01:33.440]  Yeah, it's really difficult
[01:33.440 --> 01:38.640]  But I think once we make it past this it's gonna be on an uptick for restaurants and the ones that are around are gonna
[01:38.640 --> 01:40.240]  Be really successful
[01:40.240 --> 01:42.480]  Yes, the ones that managed to stay around
[01:44.160 --> 01:45.840]  It's not
[01:45.840 --> 01:52.560]  yeah, so Soma and I met a long time ago and you know, I was going to Amsterdam for the Cannabis Cup and
[01:53.680 --> 01:56.640]  Mutual friend Todd McCormick said go to Soma's house
[01:56.680 --> 02:02.800]  Yeah, I needed help finding stuff to put my entries in for the concentrates and you know, I went to Soma's house
[02:02.800 --> 02:04.800]  It was a you know a grand experience
[02:05.440 --> 02:12.000]  Him and I were showing our stuff off like like some kids have baseball cards or comic books
[02:12.000 --> 02:15.200]  We had different types of concentrates or pokey man cards
[02:17.440 --> 02:21.880]  Yeah, and we ended up trading a bunch of urban a bunch of the concentrates it was it was great
[02:22.440 --> 02:30.240]  So, yeah, so so yeah, then that was a while back at high times and you know, every time I go to Amsterdam
[02:30.240 --> 02:33.280]  He's one of my first and last stops. It's a you know, he has a
[02:33.920 --> 02:40.720]  Beautiful beautiful place and he has an amazing collection of crystals and he breeds cats as well
[02:42.960 --> 02:46.960]  How are your cats doing actually had 61 cats born here
[02:47.600 --> 02:51.760]  In the 20 years I live here. I had 61 cats born here
[02:51.760 --> 02:54.800]  And nine of them and nine of them still live with me now
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.640]  That's amazing. All nine that all nine that live with me were born here Wow
[03:02.800 --> 03:06.000]  Yeah, pretty pretty cool, you know and you're raising all those cats
[03:06.000 --> 03:13.200]  I'm sure you see a lot of interesting traits coming through, you know breeding over the years and yes personalities
[03:13.840 --> 03:16.640]  One of the things I notice is that the grandparents
[03:17.600 --> 03:20.400]  Show up and they're like, oh, I'm gonna have a cat
[03:21.360 --> 03:23.360]  Show up in the grandchildren
[03:24.320 --> 03:28.160]  As far as like looks and manners and
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.120]  You know shape and so many different ways
[03:34.560 --> 03:36.560]  They they imitate their grandparents
[03:37.440 --> 03:42.640]  More than their parents more than their parents you see it like as the grandchildren come
[03:43.200 --> 03:45.860]  Then you see the grandparents in the grandchildren
[03:46.340 --> 03:50.340]  Yeah, and I think cannabis has a lot it's very similar in humans, you know, I feel like
[03:51.140 --> 03:55.780]  When they talk about stuff skipping generations, you know, you see it all the time with grandchildren
[03:56.340 --> 04:02.740]  That resemble their parents. I think that's sure show the way the genetics work in all the different things
[04:03.780 --> 04:04.820]  Yeah
[04:04.820 --> 04:11.300]  At once you start to study genetics whether it's in plants humans cats snakes
[04:11.620 --> 04:15.060]  Whatever rats I have a pet rat now, too. They're really nice
[04:15.620 --> 04:20.100]  But but when you start to study the genetics of these different creatures
[04:20.660 --> 04:23.480]  And their offspring and their grandchildren
[04:24.260 --> 04:27.940]  Then you start to see this connection between all genetics
[04:28.500 --> 04:30.740]  the similarity that all genetics share
[04:31.540 --> 04:32.820]  of
[04:32.820 --> 04:34.820]  these traits how they
[04:35.460 --> 04:37.940]  Where they show the genetic traits in the?
[04:38.020 --> 04:40.020]  Progeny yeah
[04:41.620 --> 04:44.020]  So, how's your snake doing you still have a snake you had the
[04:44.980 --> 04:50.660]  Cool snake here for 20 years. I live with this snake. She is really healthy
[04:51.860 --> 04:53.380]  and
[04:53.380 --> 04:55.700]  She's she's quite a nice pet
[04:57.060 --> 04:59.060]  Quite a nice pet. Yeah
[04:59.860 --> 05:01.860]  And how's your crystal collection?
[05:01.860 --> 05:03.460]  Oh like
[05:03.620 --> 05:09.940]  I'm not going to one more crystal shop. I'm not going to any gem shows nada
[05:10.660 --> 05:13.380]  But constantly people come here
[05:14.980 --> 05:16.980]  And they show me a crystal
[05:18.020 --> 05:20.020]  And I look at the crystal
[05:20.660 --> 05:26.500]  And you know crystals talk to me. So so let's say I'm a crystal collector
[05:27.380 --> 05:29.380]  I'm a crystal collector
[05:30.020 --> 05:32.580]  And you know crystals talk to me so
[05:33.140 --> 05:37.060]  So it's trouble. I look at the crystal crystal says hey, can I live here?
[05:37.540 --> 05:42.580]  And I go. Oh my god, man. This place is crowded. I don't know where you're gonna sleep
[05:43.300 --> 05:45.220]  I don't care. Just let me stay here
[05:45.300 --> 05:51.800]  I want to stay here because when when a crystal comes here for the first time it's like coming into a rainbow gathering
[05:52.340 --> 05:57.460]  There's so many different crystals from everywhere in the world that like they don't want to leave
[05:58.420 --> 06:02.660]  Like they're alive man, they start talking to each other in the crystal talk
[06:03.860 --> 06:08.900]  Behind my back and the next thing I know I got another crystal in my place, man
[06:09.620 --> 06:14.980]  Yeah, so just so you guys know soma has the largest collection of crystals i've ever seen in someone's home
[06:15.060 --> 06:19.220]  He has more crystals in his house than a lot of shops that i've been to in the world
[06:21.060 --> 06:22.820]  It's true it's true
[06:22.820 --> 06:24.820]  Yeah, you got me started on crystals
[06:25.220 --> 06:27.060]  When did I get started?
[06:27.060 --> 06:30.660]  Okay, I got you started. Oh, I got you started. Yeah
[06:31.700 --> 06:33.860]  Yeah, I get a lot of people started. Yeah, but then when did you?
[06:35.220 --> 06:37.220]  I got started in 1985
[06:39.220 --> 06:44.520]  Um, I I ended up going to prison in florida in 1983
[06:46.260 --> 06:48.840]  For trafficking in heroin and cocaine
[06:50.740 --> 06:56.920]  And I got my first set of dreadlocks cut off because I should never have been doing hard drugs with dreadlocks
[06:57.540 --> 06:59.540]  It's against the rules
[07:00.260 --> 07:02.260]  But anyway when I was in prison
[07:02.740 --> 07:04.820]  I totally got off of the hard drugs
[07:05.540 --> 07:11.860]  And when I got out after 25 and a half months, you know what that shit's like when I got out after 25 and a half
[07:11.860 --> 07:13.060]  months
[07:13.060 --> 07:15.060]  I didn't want to get back into hard drugs
[07:15.540 --> 07:17.540]  So I got into crystals
[07:17.700 --> 07:20.680]  And slowly the crystals started replacing
[07:21.540 --> 07:25.140]  All of my hard drug energy right up until now. It didn't stop
[07:25.700 --> 07:32.340]  It didn't stop every time a new crystal comes here it's kind of saying to me this is replacing your old hard drug energy
[07:35.820 --> 07:36.860]  Wow
[07:36.860 --> 07:40.300]  Really cool. So let's go back even further. Let's go back to the name soma
[07:40.460 --> 07:45.180]  You want to tell us about the name soma how that came about and yes, um origin
[07:45.980 --> 07:51.260]  I I I read soma divine mushroom of immortality by r. Gordon watson
[07:52.060 --> 07:53.560]  that he wrote in
[07:53.560 --> 07:54.780]  1957
[07:54.780 --> 07:58.700]  And that was the first place where I saw the the name soma
[07:59.740 --> 08:01.740]  And then I started researching it
[08:02.300 --> 08:04.300]  Hindi the hindi meaning
[08:04.780 --> 08:06.780]  you know the the the
[08:07.340 --> 08:09.260]  the um
[08:09.260 --> 08:11.260]  the sanskrit meaning the
[08:12.460 --> 08:17.740]  The fact that it meant a divine mushroom, you know, it's like it has many different meanings around
[08:18.380 --> 08:23.980]  Brave new world meaning of you know, the soma vacation, but but I started looking at all the different
[08:24.540 --> 08:26.620]  Ways that the word soma was used
[08:27.500 --> 08:29.500]  and in 1991
[08:31.260 --> 08:34.880]  I had a court case in Gainesville, Florida
[08:36.780 --> 08:37.820]  For
[08:37.820 --> 08:45.520]  Cannabis for selling a half ounce of cannabis to an undercover to a to a um confidential informant
[08:46.940 --> 08:50.540]  I totally like messed up because I got faked out. He gave me a
[08:51.420 --> 08:53.420]  a sad story and I
[08:53.660 --> 08:58.220]  I helped him. I gave him a half ounce of weed and the next thing I know I ended up getting busted for it
[08:58.860 --> 09:00.860]  So I had a court case going
[09:01.260 --> 09:04.620]  I had a really good lawyer who was one of my best friends
[09:05.660 --> 09:07.180]  and um
[09:07.180 --> 09:12.300]  As the court case I kept postponing it postponing it postponing it every way I could
[09:12.780 --> 09:16.300]  And then it was getting down to the wire where I couldn't postpone it anymore
[09:16.860 --> 09:18.380]  So I decided
[09:18.380 --> 09:20.480]  To become a fugitive from florida
[09:20.800 --> 09:22.800]  Get a fake id
[09:23.600 --> 09:30.080]  And leave in my motor home packing up all my crystals and some of my favorite things and going from
[09:30.640 --> 09:32.080]  Gainesville, Florida
[09:32.080 --> 09:36.640]  all the way to Eugene, Oregon across the country with a new name
[09:37.360 --> 09:41.200]  And trying to find a new life as a cannabis fugitive
[09:42.400 --> 09:46.000]  And it's I succeeded for a while. Once I got to Eugene
[09:46.720 --> 09:48.480]  I grew a great crop
[09:49.440 --> 09:52.880]  I started on my second crop and I got busted
[09:54.640 --> 09:57.520]  And eventually they found out my real name
[09:58.720 --> 10:00.880]  And florida was going to extradite me
[10:02.000 --> 10:03.760]  back to florida
[10:03.760 --> 10:08.400]  But they dropped I had my lawyers in florida working on it and they dropped the case
[10:08.800 --> 10:12.320]  So I had no more extradition to florida. I did six months
[10:13.360 --> 10:15.360]  prison in Eugene, Oregon
[10:16.320 --> 10:18.800]  Then I got three years probation and I got out
[10:20.720 --> 10:22.720]  And
[10:22.880 --> 10:28.080]  That was where the name soma came from because I took the name soma when I left florida
[10:28.560 --> 10:31.440]  So from 1991 for 30 years
[10:32.080 --> 10:38.880]  Some has been my not only my pen name, but my real name. Everybody calls me soma. Never nobody calls me mark
[10:43.040 --> 10:45.040]  Yes
[10:45.200 --> 10:48.400]  So, how did that evolve into going to amsterdam that was around the same time that
[10:48.960 --> 10:52.160]  Okay, I went to amsterdam in 94 the first time
[10:52.800 --> 10:54.800]  for a week for the cannabis cup
[10:55.280 --> 10:57.280]  and I got
[10:58.060 --> 10:59.280]  Hypnotized
[10:59.280 --> 11:02.480]  I got like mesmerized. I I saw this freedom
[11:03.440 --> 11:08.880]  It doesn't really exist here the same now as it did then but I saw this cannabis freedom back then
[11:09.680 --> 11:11.680]  That I would never see
[11:12.240 --> 11:18.000]  It was it wasn't like that in california then or anyplace else it was only like that in amsterdam right then
[11:18.480 --> 11:20.240]  and that freedom
[11:20.240 --> 11:22.240]  that freedom
[11:23.520 --> 11:28.080]  Yep, there it is that that that that freedom that I felt
[11:30.960 --> 11:32.720]  Made me move back here
[11:32.720 --> 11:36.240]  I went back and for a whole year. I thought how can I move back? How can I move there?
[11:36.240 --> 11:39.520]  How can I and then I got back here in 95 and I never left
[11:40.240 --> 11:42.240]  Wow
[11:43.200 --> 11:44.640]  Pretty amazing
[11:44.640 --> 11:47.360]  Yeah, and I guess you and todd were on the same flight over
[11:48.400 --> 11:51.700]  Yeah, yeah, because we were both good friends with jack harrier
[11:52.640 --> 11:57.600]  And I was sitting next to jack. I think todd was on the other side of jack in the plane
[11:58.240 --> 12:01.280]  And and we flew over here and at four o'clock in the morning
[12:02.400 --> 12:05.440]  I like I took out a joint about this this
[12:05.760 --> 12:12.240]  Long a short one that I had in my sock and I said to I showed it to jack
[12:12.960 --> 12:16.640]  And he goes yeah, I lied it so I lit it on the airplane
[12:17.760 --> 12:20.640]  Me and jack passed it. Everybody else was sleeping
[12:20.640 --> 12:25.840]  It was four in the morning me and jack passed it between each other and as soon as it was out
[12:26.160 --> 12:28.400]  I like crushed it up and threw it
[12:29.200 --> 12:33.760]  Away from me so it wasn't near me and the smell of the cannabis went through the cabin
[12:34.720 --> 12:39.520]  And all these cannabis cup people like 30 40 cannabis cup people were on the plane
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  everybody started waking up to the
[12:42.220 --> 12:45.520]  Fragrance of the cannabis trying to figure out where it was. Where?
[12:47.040 --> 12:49.040]  And we never got caught
[12:49.520 --> 12:54.000]  Yeah
[12:54.720 --> 12:56.720]  Pretty amazing
[12:58.720 --> 13:00.320]  Pretty amazing and uh
[13:00.320 --> 13:04.880]  Yeah, and then so let's let's take a step back even before amsterdam and
[13:05.440 --> 13:08.480]  Go back to talking about the grateful dead. I think a lot of people want to hear
[13:08.960 --> 13:09.920]  about the grateful dead
[13:09.920 --> 13:15.440]  We got a lot of dead heads that watch the show and and your experience with music and the grateful dead in florida
[13:15.520 --> 13:17.280]  As well and eugene
[13:17.280 --> 13:19.520]  Yeah, I went to 36 dead shows
[13:20.480 --> 13:22.640]  And I had a school bus
[13:24.480 --> 13:26.480]  That I turned into a motor home
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.280]  With shower a shower a king-sized bed a kitchen an oven
[13:31.920 --> 13:35.040]  Like it was really nice and I took that on tour
[13:35.760 --> 13:38.400]  and whenever there was a dead parking lot to
[13:38.880 --> 13:44.240]  To to set up I drive my bus in there set up my crystals on a few tables
[13:44.800 --> 13:46.800]  I'd sell crystals on the dead lot
[13:47.920 --> 13:49.360]  and
[13:49.360 --> 13:51.920]  I I had a great time in those times
[13:53.360 --> 13:55.360]  I love those those dead tours
[13:57.280 --> 14:04.240]  Yeah, me too I think there's a huge impact that the the dead played um culturally and on on our industry
[14:04.880 --> 14:09.360]  You know, I feel like we're kind of all just an evolution of the grateful dead in one form or another
[14:10.240 --> 14:11.920]  Yeah, it's a beautiful thing
[14:11.920 --> 14:13.920]  Yeah, yeah
[14:15.920 --> 14:18.800]  So, yeah, so, uh, yeah and then as far as
[14:19.600 --> 14:25.600]  Uh, let's see talking about tea ceremonies. We can we can jump into tea ceremonies, too. Yeah, sure
[14:26.560 --> 14:29.060]  It's like i've been a psychonaut
[14:30.400 --> 14:32.400]  since
[14:32.780 --> 14:34.780]  1968
[14:35.760 --> 14:39.600]  So I got 52 years of psychonautics and
[14:41.520 --> 14:45.280]  The thing i've done most is the psilocybin mushrooms
[14:47.120 --> 14:52.580]  I did a lot of lsd too in the early days and i've done a bunch of peyote i've done san pedro
[14:52.960 --> 14:55.200]  I've done ayahuasca 56 times
[14:56.160 --> 14:58.160]  And my latest
[14:59.600 --> 15:01.600]  Interest is the bufo toad
[15:02.640 --> 15:04.640]  the bufo alvarius
[15:04.960 --> 15:10.000]  And that to me is one of the most amazing psychedelics i've ever seen
[15:10.720 --> 15:14.320]  But I did do 122 mushroom teas here in europe
[15:16.400 --> 15:19.120]  And each one had about 20 people at them
[15:20.560 --> 15:22.560]  So it was a group tea
[15:22.560 --> 15:23.520]  and
[15:23.520 --> 15:28.640]  I still have people coming to me telling me that it changed their lives the tea they came to
[15:31.360 --> 15:33.360]  Yeah
[15:33.600 --> 15:38.420]  Yeah, everyone I know that's ever had your mushrooms have had profound experiences
[15:40.080 --> 15:42.480]  And and you see now in the
[15:43.440 --> 15:44.960]  Time we're in now
[15:44.960 --> 15:48.020]  Mushrooms are starting to get used as a therapeutic
[15:48.800 --> 15:50.800]  they're getting recommended by
[15:51.180 --> 15:55.620]  Psychologists and psychiatrists and all kinds of doctors are recommending
[15:56.720 --> 16:00.320]  doing at least micro dosing with mushrooms to help your
[16:01.680 --> 16:03.040]  psyche
[16:03.040 --> 16:07.040]  Yeah, and they're starting to become decriminalized all over the united states oakland
[16:10.080 --> 16:15.700]  Because these things should never have been criminal ever they're a blessing a blessing to humankind
[16:16.960 --> 16:18.960]  Yeah agreed
[16:19.600 --> 16:21.860]  And then you look at how corrupt
[16:23.360 --> 16:24.560]  These
[16:24.560 --> 16:26.960]  systems that aren't psychedelic are
[16:27.760 --> 16:30.720]  Almost all they do is lie. They have no value for truth
[16:31.600 --> 16:37.920]  They just spread one lie after another lie after another lie, and they're the most unpsychedelic people you ever saw
[16:40.320 --> 16:42.320]  Agreed
[16:42.480 --> 16:48.480]  Yeah, so tell us more about the bufo, uh your experiences with the bufo, how do you get the bufos from a toad, right?
[16:49.200 --> 16:51.200]  The bufo is from a toad
[16:51.280 --> 16:54.580]  That is found in the sonoran mountains in mexico
[16:57.040 --> 17:03.040]  It hibernates for nine months out of the year
[17:06.000 --> 17:11.040]  No, excuse me it hibernates for three months out of the year during the rainy season
[17:11.920 --> 17:13.200]  it
[17:13.200 --> 17:18.800]  No during the dry season it hibernates it stays in the mud doesn't hardly you can hardly find them
[17:19.280 --> 17:26.160]  And then when the rainy season happens, they start to come out because they need a lot of moisture to be able to move around
[17:27.360 --> 17:29.940]  And so they come out of out of their hibernation
[17:30.960 --> 17:38.240]  And they and they and they start moving around the the mountains and people gently catch them
[17:40.240 --> 17:44.800]  And there's glands on their back shoulders and on the back of their hips
[17:45.280 --> 17:52.400]  That can gently be squeezed and this fluid comes out of these glands and you squeeze it onto like a mirror
[17:53.200 --> 17:55.520]  And you let it dry it dries pretty quick
[17:56.080 --> 18:00.240]  And it dries into these yellow crystals that you scrape off with a razor blade
[18:01.760 --> 18:03.760]  Then you take those crystals
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.720]  And you put about a tenth of a gram in a glass pipe
[18:08.000 --> 18:09.520]  a special
[18:09.520 --> 18:11.520]  closed in glass pipe
[18:11.840 --> 18:13.840]  And you heat it with a torch
[18:13.840 --> 18:15.360]  and
[18:15.360 --> 18:17.460]  As soon as it starts to vaporize
[18:18.400 --> 18:19.760]  you
[18:19.760 --> 18:23.840]  You blow all your air out and you take the the smoke in
[18:24.400 --> 18:30.480]  As steady and slow as you can and then when you've taken it to the full capacity of your lungs
[18:31.440 --> 18:33.440]  you kind of swallow it and just
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.560]  don't even think about exhaling it you just
[18:37.920 --> 18:39.520]  Let it go
[18:39.520 --> 18:41.680]  and within 15 or 20 seconds
[18:42.160 --> 18:44.160]  You're gone
[18:45.200 --> 18:46.080]  You
[18:46.080 --> 18:48.480]  You you are gone your body
[18:49.040 --> 18:51.920]  You're you're not in the room anymore
[18:52.720 --> 18:54.000]  you're
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.120]  Commuting with your ancestors you're going to the source
[18:57.680 --> 18:59.920]  You're like going through all your fears
[19:00.480 --> 19:06.000]  You're going through I've many times i've gone through my death and i've seen myself die
[19:07.680 --> 19:09.760]  And i'm gone i'm not there no more
[19:09.840 --> 19:14.560]  And just when I think god man, I can't believe I died i'm
[19:15.520 --> 19:17.520]  I find that I
[19:18.080 --> 19:19.280]  Death
[19:19.280 --> 19:21.520]  It is in the end. I'm in this place. That's
[19:22.320 --> 19:25.920]  Beyond death and before birth like the same spot
[19:26.960 --> 19:32.800]  This eternal spot that is like the real permanent spot and this place is like the temporary spot
[19:33.920 --> 19:35.360]  and
[19:35.360 --> 19:37.840]  Once you and it only lasts for a few minutes
[19:38.160 --> 19:42.880]  Once you and it only lasts 20 minutes and you come out of it 20 minutes later
[19:45.280 --> 19:52.800]  And you feel so thankful for every breath every glimpse every situation every
[19:53.760 --> 19:55.280]  every
[19:55.280 --> 19:58.320]  Everything in life that you can think of you feel grateful for like
[19:58.960 --> 20:00.960]  You never felt that grateful before
[20:01.280 --> 20:03.300]  And that gratefulness that thankfulness
[20:04.800 --> 20:06.800]  It changes you
[20:07.200 --> 20:09.700]  And in between each bufo experience
[20:10.400 --> 20:13.040]  I haven't done it for two months now soon. I'm going to do it again
[20:14.720 --> 20:16.720]  But in between that bufo experience
[20:18.080 --> 20:24.800]  You start working on yourself you start working on your lifestyle on your consciousness on your pathways on your
[20:25.680 --> 20:27.200]  on
[20:27.200 --> 20:33.520]  On on who you are you dive deep inside of your core and you really start to realize
[20:34.160 --> 20:35.840]  Who you really are?
[20:35.840 --> 20:39.600]  And just like this this beautiful organic cannabis
[20:44.270 --> 20:46.270]  Helps you go inside yourself
[20:46.830 --> 20:48.830]  the bufo is like
[20:49.450 --> 20:55.230]  Amplifying going inside your smoke and even if you only do it once you're never the same
[20:57.390 --> 21:03.950]  How do you compare the bufo to to uh dmt I mean it is dmt but like dmt the synthesized dmt
[21:04.590 --> 21:10.850]  You know i've experienced dmt but never bufo and i've had definitely full melt experiences with dmt in barcelona
[21:11.470 --> 21:14.930]  Actually, well, well the bufo is five emmy o dmt
[21:15.550 --> 21:22.830]  But it's different than the other dmt the other dmt I get super colorful like rainbow visions like like
[21:23.530 --> 21:25.230]  vibrating colors
[21:25.230 --> 21:27.230]  and with the bufo
[21:27.470 --> 21:29.470]  I mostly see white
[21:29.710 --> 21:30.750]  and
[21:30.750 --> 21:32.510]  I mostly
[21:32.510 --> 21:34.110]  feel
[21:34.110 --> 21:39.230]  My core and my ancestors, but i'm not really seeing a bunch of colors like the other one
[21:40.030 --> 21:46.430]  Right. Yeah. I had a similar experience on nitrous oxide actually believe it or not when I was like 15 years old 16 years old
[21:46.430 --> 21:47.710]  at a rave
[21:47.710 --> 21:51.070]  In a in a private room in a rave and you know that changed my life forever
[21:51.310 --> 21:54.430]  I'd already done lsd but that full melt experience where you're
[21:55.450 --> 21:57.870]  communicating with the ancestors and
[21:58.430 --> 22:02.750]  Angels and angels. Yeah, that's a great way to put it. I mean it's funny
[22:03.310 --> 22:07.550]  Uh, the the things that you experience and then coming back into reality
[22:07.550 --> 22:14.350]  You can't really articulate everything that you experience. It's so much greater than what we can comprehend in this realm
[22:15.390 --> 22:19.230]  true true and and you start to realize that
[22:20.270 --> 22:22.270]  There is this eternal spot
[22:25.460 --> 22:27.620]  That is pure heaven
[22:30.990 --> 22:32.990]  Pure heaven, right
[22:33.390 --> 22:36.350]  And once you realize that that spot exists
[22:37.310 --> 22:39.310]  And that you can reach it
[22:39.470 --> 22:41.630]  Just with your consciousness without anything
[22:43.310 --> 22:47.550]  It it gives you this inspiration that takes you through every day
[22:49.470 --> 22:51.470]  Yeah
[22:52.750 --> 22:59.550]  Yeah, it's amazing it's amazing how psychedelics can open your mind and allow you to see things beautiful
[23:00.430 --> 23:06.270]  Passing the joint to all the people watching. Hope you guys are all smoking and enjoying weed with us
[23:08.430 --> 23:10.430]  But yeah, it's amazing how uh
[23:10.890 --> 23:15.070]  Psychedelics can change you they can change the way you think and make you see the world how it really is
[23:15.310 --> 23:18.610]  I feel like a lot of it for me with psychedelics with mushrooms, especially
[23:19.310 --> 23:22.030]  There's these filters that experience as we live
[23:22.510 --> 23:27.870]  Puts these filters over our eyes and we get these these filters and as we take different psychedelics
[23:27.870 --> 23:32.350]  We can lift those filters and actually see the world how it really is and and it actually
[23:32.990 --> 23:34.510]  teaches us
[23:34.510 --> 23:37.070]  to filter everything through our hearts
[23:38.510 --> 23:44.270]  Because we're taught in this world to filter everything through our heads our egos our minds
[23:45.070 --> 23:48.910]  But when you start to filter what you're experiencing through your heart
[23:49.950 --> 23:52.910]  That's when you start to see truth in a whole other light
[23:54.750 --> 23:56.750]  Yeah
[23:57.070 --> 23:58.590]  Yeah
[23:58.590 --> 24:03.790]  So yeah, let's talk about the spa the house spa. Have you been to the well, I guess the spa is closed
[24:04.270 --> 24:09.390]  Yes, like every single thing that's good here. Oh, man, it's close
[24:10.110 --> 24:13.710]  The only thing that's open is the grocery store the health food store
[24:14.350 --> 24:15.710]  the bank
[24:15.710 --> 24:17.150]  um
[24:17.150 --> 24:19.150]  um the printer
[24:19.310 --> 24:22.850]  And every and everything is like you got to wait online outside
[24:23.570 --> 24:28.530]  You have to wear a mask I never wear a mask I have a card I carry
[24:33.130 --> 24:35.770]  Yeah, and here's the dutch
[24:38.330 --> 24:40.090]  Oh nice
[24:40.090 --> 24:42.090]  But i've never worn a mask
[24:42.330 --> 24:47.690]  I had two heart operations. There's no way i'm wearing a mask. But the last time I went to the sauna
[24:48.090 --> 24:50.330]  They wanted me to wear a mask
[24:50.570 --> 24:56.170]  Not in the sauna, but all the other places before you walk into the sauna and I said
[24:56.730 --> 24:58.730]  I've been coming here 11 years
[24:59.370 --> 25:01.850]  If you think I came here
[25:02.890 --> 25:04.890]  To wear a mask in the sauna
[25:06.490 --> 25:11.770]  You guys are crazy, there's no way i'm wearing a mask here I came here to get healthy I came here to breathe
[25:12.250 --> 25:16.490]  I don't want to like stop my breathing with a mask that mask don't protect us
[25:16.490 --> 25:22.010]  That mask don't protect us from nothing. Don't you read the package? It says it doesn't protect you from anything
[25:23.210 --> 25:24.490]  Yeah
[25:24.490 --> 25:30.670]  And me i'm an activist everywhere. I go here. I like talk about the mass I go anti-vaccine
[25:31.370 --> 25:33.610]  Man, are you kidding that vaccine's killing everybody?
[25:34.250 --> 25:39.210]  There's no way i'm gonna take that vaccine or let anybody I know take it
[25:41.450 --> 25:43.130]  Yeah
[25:43.130 --> 25:47.290]  Uh, so spa zuvia, which is where soma took me for the first time in
[25:49.830 --> 25:53.370]  Yeah, it's spelled zuvia z u v i e r
[25:54.170 --> 25:55.450]  yeah, and
[25:55.450 --> 25:57.930]  It's one of the most amazing places in the world the sound of there is
[25:58.730 --> 26:04.670]  And hopefully you didn't go bankrupt because it's been closed for so long now. They have so many employees
[26:05.370 --> 26:09.290]  So much rent. I don't know what's happening with it. I wait to hear
[26:09.690 --> 26:13.690]  But like they must be suffering they must be getting a lot of money from the
[26:14.410 --> 26:17.450]  From the government to be able to just keep the lights on
[26:18.970 --> 26:21.770]  Like many places here right now many places are
[26:23.050 --> 26:28.250]  Yeah, how's the golden temple golden temple is a restaurant that soma's taken me to since i've met him. Yeah, I mean
[26:28.970 --> 26:32.890]  Yeah, i've been eating there for for um, 26
[26:33.930 --> 26:36.490]  27 years i've been eating there and
[26:37.130 --> 26:41.610]  They are suffering I get takeout from there at least once or twice a week
[26:42.170 --> 26:45.690]  So that I I support them a little bit because it's only takeout
[26:46.250 --> 26:49.530]  Every restaurant I know here that's good is only takeout
[26:51.370 --> 26:52.330]  Yeah
[26:52.330 --> 26:58.910]  It's unfortunate. All right, so you guys don't do any sort of uh indoor dining or or outdoor dining?
[26:58.910 --> 27:01.070]  There's not allowed. I would love to do some
[27:01.790 --> 27:05.470]  Like i'm, you know, you know the saturday organic market that's here
[27:06.190 --> 27:09.630]  Did I ever take you there yes, and I used to go there with mila as well
[27:10.190 --> 27:12.830]  Yeah, okay. Well, I was there yesterday
[27:13.870 --> 27:15.870]  yesterday, there's these
[27:16.190 --> 27:18.190]  this these
[27:18.430 --> 27:22.110]  Law enforcement people called handhobbing. That's the dutch
[27:22.670 --> 27:25.710]  And what they do is they make sure you social distance
[27:26.270 --> 27:28.270]  They make sure you um
[27:29.070 --> 27:31.070]  Don't hug don't
[27:31.610 --> 27:34.350]  Handshake don't don't hug
[27:34.830 --> 27:36.430]  Don't
[27:36.430 --> 27:39.070]  Don't bring your heart chakra next to somebody else's
[27:39.550 --> 27:44.990]  Heart chakra within six feet because that's when heart chakras connect so they try and separate all that shit
[27:45.390 --> 27:47.470]  But yesterday they were actually telling people
[27:48.110 --> 27:51.870]  That you couldn't sit down on a bench and eat something
[27:53.230 --> 27:55.230]  Wow at the market at the market
[27:57.950 --> 27:59.790]  It's totally absurd
[27:59.790 --> 28:00.670]  Yeah
[28:00.670 --> 28:03.470]  It's it's it's getting so absurd these days that
[28:04.350 --> 28:09.630]  I just wrote this article. It's in dutch for the dutch cannabis magazine. I write for
[28:10.350 --> 28:13.390]  But it's the name of it is lockdowns and cannabis
[28:14.830 --> 28:18.110]  And it's all about how cannabis helps during the lockdown
[28:20.910 --> 28:21.790]  Right
[28:21.790 --> 28:23.790]  Yes, it's very beneficial. I mean, I think
[28:24.350 --> 28:31.870]  You cannabis as far as they even are doing studies in israel that have found that there's significant benefits for it for preventing
[28:31.870 --> 28:33.870]  Covid so yes
[28:34.910 --> 28:40.770]  Cannabis makes you grow brain cells. So how can growing brain cells be a bad thing during lockdowns?
[28:41.550 --> 28:44.350]  Well, yeah, and your your proof that cannabis doesn't make you sterile
[28:44.350 --> 28:49.230]  You you've been smoking your whole life and had a child not too long ago, which is very impressive
[28:49.870 --> 28:52.350]  My son is is about to be eight
[28:52.910 --> 28:55.010]  So that means when I was 63
[28:56.750 --> 28:58.750]  I was still making babies
[28:58.990 --> 29:02.750]  Yeah, so that argument is put to put to rest nobody can argue
[29:03.630 --> 29:06.990]  Here I am almost 72. I'll be 72 this year
[29:07.790 --> 29:09.790]  I ain't wearing a mask
[29:12.030 --> 29:14.510]  Yeah, i'm in the older range they say
[29:15.070 --> 29:21.710]  I don't believe in this covid shit. I think it's nothing but the flu and a common cold and the pcr tests are a fraud
[29:22.350 --> 29:26.430]  Total fraud they can be adjusted any which way to show
[29:27.390 --> 29:31.310]  Total pandemic or total planned emic
[29:36.890 --> 29:41.770]  You cut out right there what was the last thing you said soma total planned emic yes
[29:42.730 --> 29:44.250]  That's what it is
[29:44.250 --> 29:48.250]  Because i've been watching for one year here. We've been locked down here for a whole year
[29:49.850 --> 29:51.850]  And I don't see nobody dying
[29:53.290 --> 29:55.050]  It's bullshit
[29:55.050 --> 29:57.050]  It's only the flu or a cold
[29:58.170 --> 30:00.170]  It's only a media
[30:00.550 --> 30:02.070]  paranoia
[30:02.070 --> 30:03.850]  avalanche
[30:03.850 --> 30:05.850]  Yeah
[30:06.250 --> 30:10.650]  Well, let's start talking about some cannabis because I feel like guys in the chat are really interested in uh,
[30:11.130 --> 30:13.290]  Oh, someone's talking about rock bud. I think we
[30:14.170 --> 30:20.970]  That'd be a great place to start if you if you let me tell everybody about my experience soma a plus aka rock bud
[30:21.450 --> 30:23.930]  Is one of the most amazing plants that i've ever grown in my life
[30:24.090 --> 30:29.370]  And I have yet to get it back in the last 20 years, but over 20 years ago. I
[30:30.170 --> 30:35.770]  grew but aka soma a plus and it's so many plus because it's a plus grade quality
[30:36.010 --> 30:39.050]  It's a little on the leafy side. It's a very short indica plant
[30:39.610 --> 30:43.930]  That's just absolutely amazing on the nose and it burns down to the roach
[30:43.930 --> 30:47.770]  It's another one of those varieties that has like real strong pungent
[30:48.390 --> 30:52.410]  Skunkiness to it and uh, you know, you write like the roach up the next day
[30:52.410 --> 30:57.850]  It's another one tastes just as amazing you like right light that roach up two days three days a week later
[30:57.930 --> 31:01.370]  And it still tastes the same, you know, and it's like it's very rare to have
[31:02.070 --> 31:07.130]  Cultivars like that. It made my favorite water hash. It made my favorite water hash that one. Yeah
[31:07.770 --> 31:09.770]  the most full melt
[31:09.770 --> 31:14.570]  Delicious water hash kind of reddish reddish orange. Yeah, that's what I was gonna say
[31:14.650 --> 31:19.530]  It makes reddish orange water hash that is just amazing, you know, you can yeah
[31:20.390 --> 31:22.390]  Absolutely. So what are the genetics behind it?
[31:23.450 --> 31:26.250]  That was um a big skunk korean
[31:26.650 --> 31:31.610]  A super skunk and afghani hawaiian
[31:34.170 --> 31:40.650]  Yeah, and it really had those afghan traits that that afghanica really expresses with it I just yeah
[31:42.330 --> 31:47.850]  Yeah, it's one of those ones that's out of a handful of strains I would rate it in my top 10 for sure
[31:48.410 --> 31:50.670]  I have a new one now called labnesia
[31:51.850 --> 31:54.750]  It's 50 lavender 50 amnesia
[31:56.250 --> 31:58.430]  And it is so turpy
[32:00.810 --> 32:02.810]  Wow, it's like
[32:03.510 --> 32:05.510]  27 thc
[32:06.810 --> 32:08.810]  And
[32:08.810 --> 32:11.130]  Really good yield really good yield like
[32:12.250 --> 32:14.810]  It's such a good mix of the two of those two strains
[32:15.690 --> 32:22.170]  Yeah, so somewhere in the middle you get a little floral character with the amnesia. That's like that lemon lime
[32:23.130 --> 32:25.130]  the a little bit haze
[32:25.430 --> 32:29.530]  Characteristics. Yeah. Yeah, and it's so nice really so nice
[32:29.770 --> 32:32.410]  So I have seeds of that one now that i'm spreading around
[32:33.050 --> 32:35.530]  And soon it'll show up in some coffee shops here
[32:36.170 --> 32:40.330]  That's amazing. So does it take the flowering time down on the amnesia as well a little bit?
[32:40.650 --> 32:46.570]  Yeah, i'd say a week to a week and a half less amazing. Yeah, and amnesia is just you know
[32:46.650 --> 32:52.730]  So let's talk about amnesia for a little bit amnesia and super silver haze are very similar and related but not the same
[32:53.610 --> 32:58.410]  Yeah, because my my my amnesia has south
[32:59.430 --> 33:01.430]  southeast asian in it
[33:01.610 --> 33:03.610]  and some of the other ones
[33:03.850 --> 33:05.610]  They don't have that
[33:05.610 --> 33:08.750]  Yeah, they have they have like jamaican sativa
[33:09.450 --> 33:11.530]  south american sativa, but not the
[33:12.230 --> 33:14.230]  southeast asian sativa
[33:14.810 --> 33:19.370]  Yeah, and the amnesia is sweet you get a sweetness to it. It's it gives it this sweetness
[33:19.450 --> 33:21.530]  It makes it take a little bit longer to flower
[33:22.730 --> 33:25.530]  But it's so much nicer than the other
[33:26.330 --> 33:31.450]  Strains around here that are called amnesia or called another kind of haze. Yeah
[33:33.530 --> 33:37.050]  Yeah, so new york new york city diesel well, I guess we could still talk about amnesia
[33:37.130 --> 33:39.130]  It looks like there was some questions about it
[33:39.770 --> 33:41.770]  uh, but yeah, so
[33:41.770 --> 33:46.330]  Let's move on to the sour diesel though real quick and the your new york city diesel
[33:46.330 --> 33:50.410]  So there's a big confusion. They are not the same strain not at all. Not at all
[33:50.890 --> 33:54.330]  No, no, they both have the same last name. Yeah
[33:55.130 --> 33:56.010]  but
[33:56.010 --> 33:58.250]  They're not the same. No, I mean
[33:58.890 --> 34:04.410]  And they're both great. They're both great in their own ways like sour diesel is very indica
[34:05.290 --> 34:12.570]  A really great strain to make water hash from to make rosin from sour diesel. I grow it here myself
[34:13.450 --> 34:15.690]  I grow the strawberry sour diesel here
[34:16.570 --> 34:23.370]  And I love it, it's a great strain but it's nothing like the new york city diesel the new york city diesel
[34:24.250 --> 34:30.270]  First of all, it smells when you smell it like red ripe grapefruits
[34:31.370 --> 34:38.110]  Like strong like the super grapefruit smell and when you smoke it, it tastes like grapefruits
[34:38.730 --> 34:40.410]  Yeah
[34:40.410 --> 34:43.050]  It is not very good for making water hash
[34:44.010 --> 34:49.690]  It's not the right try you know how some strains aren't the right trichomes for making water hash and some are
[34:50.250 --> 34:52.250]  Do you find that? Oh, yeah
[34:53.610 --> 34:57.610]  Yeah, yeah, so new york city diesel no good for water hash
[34:59.930 --> 35:04.170]  Great for like weed though and great for for crossing
[35:04.890 --> 35:11.050]  With other genetics to make a new uh strain so many people have used the new york city diesel
[35:11.610 --> 35:13.610]  To make a new hybrid
[35:13.610 --> 35:15.610]  And it's it works great for that
[35:16.330 --> 35:18.970]  Like it mixes with other strains really well
[35:19.530 --> 35:20.790]  and actually
[35:20.790 --> 35:26.970]  Sometimes becomes something that I like better than the new york city diesel like somari for example
[35:27.350 --> 35:32.730]  Somari is new york city diesel buddha's sister and kusha delic. It's a three-way cross
[35:33.850 --> 35:38.010]  And that that is in many coffee shops here. That's very popular
[35:38.970 --> 35:42.650]  Yeah, that's a cannabis cup award-winning variety I remember the cup you won in
[35:43.270 --> 35:49.130]  2013. Yeah, and and that one is a faster finisher than the new york city diesel
[35:49.610 --> 35:55.530]  One of the things that people didn't like about the nycd is that it took 12 weeks to flower
[35:56.250 --> 35:58.170]  Whereas like the somari takes 10 weeks
[35:58.170 --> 36:03.290]  So you save two weeks and you still get that diesel taste not as strong, but it's there
[36:04.090 --> 36:05.130]  and
[36:05.130 --> 36:09.050]  But I love the diesel the diesel has such a great
[36:10.090 --> 36:12.090]  Calyx to leaf ratio
[36:12.410 --> 36:17.450]  I mean, it's hardly you can manicure it so easy because it's hardly any leaves at the end. It's all calyx
[36:18.330 --> 36:21.600]  Yeah
[36:21.680 --> 36:28.160]  Yeah, amazing turf profile though, I mean absolutely those turfs those turfs like you can
[36:28.880 --> 36:31.680]  It's like signature turfs the minute you smell it
[36:32.320 --> 36:35.040]  You you can't help but say this is new york city, you know
[36:35.920 --> 36:38.000]  Nobody has to tell you what it is. Oh, it's been
[36:39.760 --> 36:46.080]  100 it's been bred into stuff that i've smoked and those profiles have come across and I know exactly where it came from
[36:46.400 --> 36:49.280]  Yet you weren't credited for it. You know, it's like right and that's the
[36:50.080 --> 36:52.080]  Like you're talking about tangy
[36:53.440 --> 37:00.080]  Well, there are some varieties for sure well speaking of tangy, you know, I think don and aaron years ago came to amsterdam
[37:00.240 --> 37:03.920]  And you worked with don and aaron from the beginning. I think my first experience
[37:05.280 --> 37:08.800]  In the beginning I gave them their first clones when they got here
[37:09.600 --> 37:11.600]  wow
[37:11.600 --> 37:15.360]  Yeah, good guys, and I also introduced them to a few helpful people
[37:16.240 --> 37:18.240]  right
[37:18.320 --> 37:20.640]  Yeah, I love those guys I love those guys
[37:21.360 --> 37:24.000]  And I love seeing how successful they became
[37:24.720 --> 37:28.080]  Oh, wow, man, what a what a great example for everybody
[37:28.960 --> 37:30.140]  You know
[37:30.140 --> 37:31.440]  quality
[37:31.440 --> 37:32.880]  quality matter
[37:32.880 --> 37:34.880]  quality matter and
[37:35.440 --> 37:40.800]  Quality matters and doing it right. I feel like those guys have done a lot of great things and you know, they're
[37:41.580 --> 37:43.520]  award-winning recipe
[37:43.520 --> 37:49.040]  For winning all those cups and then on top of that, you know, I think really priding themselves in quality over the years and
[37:49.920 --> 37:55.840]  You know, I think they've they've kind of set an example of what you can do as a large corporation now, you know
[37:56.480 --> 37:57.840]  Yes
[37:57.840 --> 37:59.600]  going white
[37:59.600 --> 38:04.400]  Yeah international. I mean these guys are internet, you know, I just read the other day. They're they're in columbia now
[38:04.480 --> 38:10.080]  You know i've been working on in columbia as well, but those guys are going to be in columbia. They're doing licensing agreements all over and
[38:11.040 --> 38:14.580]  You know, I think they have a wide variety of interesting and really good genetics
[38:15.900 --> 38:17.840]  absolutely
[38:17.840 --> 38:19.840]  absolutely
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.680]  So, yeah, let's talk about lavender for a little bit I think that's been on people's mind people love the lavender, you know
[38:26.240 --> 38:28.880]  I love the lavender too and it's still going strong
[38:29.440 --> 38:33.280]  Still going strong here. It's a you know what the lavender is great for
[38:34.640 --> 38:36.640]  if you spray it with
[38:37.440 --> 38:39.440]  um
[38:39.760 --> 38:45.040]  Silver thiosulfate to turn it to turn a female into a male
[38:47.040 --> 38:49.280]  It's one of the best plants you could ever do that with
[38:50.240 --> 38:53.620]  Full reversal it makes such a great reversal
[38:54.480 --> 38:57.920]  And and when and then whatever you mix it to
[38:58.720 --> 39:00.720]  Seems to improve
[39:03.110 --> 39:10.230]  Doesn't matter what it is, whatever you cross like it was it was lavender feminized pollen
[39:12.710 --> 39:14.710]  That like
[39:14.790 --> 39:18.710]  Got the amnesia to make the the labnesia seed
[39:20.470 --> 39:25.030]  Because lavender if you did it the other way around with the amnesia it wouldn't work as good
[39:25.830 --> 39:28.330]  Right. The lavender works so good in that reversal
[39:28.950 --> 39:30.870]  that we use it to
[39:30.870 --> 39:32.870]  to hybrid a lot of stuff
[39:33.750 --> 39:37.350]  Even even autos we have lavender auto
[39:38.310 --> 39:39.830]  awesome, you know
[39:39.830 --> 39:42.390]  Yeah, yeah autos are making their their their
[39:43.030 --> 39:44.550]  Yeah
[39:44.550 --> 39:48.790]  I just remembered because me I was never into the autos
[39:48.950 --> 39:53.110]  I I just I like the concept of it and everything but this past summer
[39:53.830 --> 39:58.230]  I grew some on my I have another balcony and I grew some on this other balcony
[39:59.190 --> 40:02.310]  Right in my window box because they didn't get very big
[40:03.750 --> 40:08.150]  Right facing the grok. You could see him from across the street like in full view
[40:09.350 --> 40:15.110]  And nobody could really tell what they were nobody that didn't know could really tell what they were unless they had
[40:15.730 --> 40:17.730]  Binoculars maybe and then maybe they could
[40:18.390 --> 40:20.390]  And I harvested on august 6th
[40:20.950 --> 40:22.950]  outdoors here
[40:23.350 --> 40:25.350]  Which was so handy
[40:25.910 --> 40:32.150]  Oh my god, what a handy thing I was with my japanese friends and they're all going oh
[40:33.270 --> 40:36.310]  We need for japan. We need this for japan
[40:36.950 --> 40:38.710]  and like that like
[40:38.710 --> 40:41.590]  You know because they they're kind of like easy to hide
[40:42.390 --> 40:48.470]  They're pretty easy to hide autos. Yeah, and they're so damn fast and I couldn't believe how many
[40:48.950 --> 40:51.670]  The ones I was growing I couldn't believe how many crystals
[40:52.310 --> 40:54.550]  Tricones it had it was loaded man
[40:55.110 --> 40:57.110]  It was low. The only thing I didn't like
[40:57.990 --> 41:03.430]  Was the yield? Oh my god, you can smoke a plan an hour with that stuff like
[41:04.470 --> 41:10.230]  Your plan here a minute ago. Yeah, I smoked it the whole plan. Yeah, man. It wasn't even an animal, you know
[41:14.310 --> 41:18.150]  Yeah, and that's getting we're improving that I think uh, you know i'm kind of working on
[41:19.030 --> 41:24.550]  There's there's much room for improvement the better thing that you cross into the auto
[41:25.510 --> 41:31.430]  the better cross you're going to get that's going to come up in thc and and and and
[41:31.890 --> 41:34.550]  Terpenes and everything is you're going to like it more
[41:35.910 --> 41:42.630]  Because I like what I find so far is with the autos against the normals the normals have much more turps
[41:43.190 --> 41:46.570]  You were getting there though i'll tell you that some of the that you look at true percentages
[41:47.110 --> 41:49.110]  On some of the tests, we're definitely
[41:49.190 --> 41:55.750]  Going in the right direction. See see I I need the turps for me the most healing part of cannabis
[41:56.310 --> 41:58.310]  These days is terpenes
[41:58.310 --> 42:00.070]  You can show me
[42:00.070 --> 42:04.390]  Thc percentages cbd percentages cbg percentages
[42:04.950 --> 42:06.230]  whatever
[42:06.230 --> 42:08.070]  but for me
[42:08.070 --> 42:10.630]  Whatever when when I get the turps that
[42:10.790 --> 42:12.790]  It's like they they go in my brain they go
[42:14.310 --> 42:16.310]  When I get the turps that do that
[42:17.030 --> 42:21.030]  Lately, it's skittles that does it to me that that z-turb, you know the z-turb
[42:21.750 --> 42:27.350]  Put this in your autos and then you you know, i'm I got it going here. I got the the
[42:27.970 --> 42:29.350]  authentic
[42:29.350 --> 42:33.750]  Skittles mothers going right now and i'm starting to work with it
[42:33.750 --> 42:38.150]  I'm gonna make some crosses with some of my strains too because I love that z-turb
[42:38.710 --> 42:40.710]  I just love what it does to my taste
[42:41.750 --> 42:45.350]  Every time I smoke it. It's like it's like grapefruit in the diesel
[42:45.910 --> 42:51.430]  The skittles I know it's even if it's only in part of the joint blend
[42:51.590 --> 42:55.350]  I know the skittles is there because it's excellent excellent turps
[42:56.230 --> 42:58.230]  Yeah
[42:58.230 --> 43:03.430]  Yeah agreed. I love skittles. I you know people that know me really well know I love skittles and love
[43:03.670 --> 43:06.070]  Some of these skittle crosses that are coming down. I think
[43:06.150 --> 43:08.150]  Great they're great some of them
[43:08.710 --> 43:10.390]  Yeah, it took a while for people to get it down
[43:10.390 --> 43:15.350]  I think it's a hard plant to work with the structure's terrible of the plant, but the turps are just amazing
[43:18.150 --> 43:22.230]  So, so there's a there's actually nine o'clock curfew here
[43:23.510 --> 43:26.070]  My my granddaughter has to leave now
[43:27.030 --> 43:29.350]  And you know just for example, man
[43:31.830 --> 43:33.830]  It's wow
[43:34.390 --> 43:39.030]  It's wow or else you get a 95 euro ticket
[43:40.950 --> 43:43.990]  Oh man, can you tell lexus
[43:45.990 --> 43:52.470]  Yeah, that's wild it really is wild that you can ticket people for curfew with this whole covet thing I just uh, it's wild

[45:27.550 --> 45:29.550]  The lockdown is really good for gardening
[45:30.110 --> 45:35.230]  Really good. Yeah, people are real focused so much gardening. I did so much gardening like every time I go
[45:35.790 --> 45:40.670]  I'm going stir crazy here. No, I go to the garden and I start moving soil and
[45:40.830 --> 45:43.710]  No, I go to the garden and I start moving soil and

[45:51.070 --> 45:52.430]  Do you ever grow it?
[45:52.430 --> 45:56.270]  I've only grown the microgreens the celery microgreens i've done those and you know
[45:56.270 --> 46:00.030]  Those are amazing as well and they have the real celery flavor. Oh, man
[46:00.670 --> 46:05.630]  Like every part of the celery gives you that that celery's uh, you know, I mean
[46:06.030 --> 46:07.310]  Everything
[46:07.310 --> 46:12.990]  Everything man. I mean what a cool plant really I never grew one before last summer
[46:14.190 --> 46:15.790]  Me and my son
[46:15.790 --> 46:17.790]  I made some black bean soup
[46:18.910 --> 46:21.790]  I cut the bottom of the celery off about that much
[46:22.830 --> 46:24.830]  And I put it in water
[46:25.070 --> 46:26.670]  Did you ever do that?
[46:26.670 --> 46:28.830]  Where you regrow it from the root? Yeah. Yeah
[46:29.790 --> 46:33.790]  Fuck man, it does it so good and we took it we planted it on the roof
[46:34.590 --> 46:39.630]  And we got this gigantic celery plant like a celery seed plant
[46:40.430 --> 46:45.550]  And we have thousands of seeds from last summer. I'm gonna plant some this spring
[46:46.190 --> 46:48.270]  From the celery seeds that we grew together
[46:48.990 --> 46:52.910]  Awesome. What a cool it needs a lot of water. Holy shit
[46:53.470 --> 46:56.110]  Yes needs a lot of water. Wow
[46:57.230 --> 46:59.230]  Yeah, it's an amazing plant, you know
[47:00.190 --> 47:03.630]  Cannabis has taught me to grow all the other plants man. Yeah
[47:04.490 --> 47:07.550]  Cannabis was was what like inspired me
[47:08.430 --> 47:12.190]  To grow all the I grow so many different plants these days
[47:12.590 --> 47:17.710]  Well, and you've really experimented over the years on your rooftop with everything you can possibly grow. I've got
[47:18.590 --> 47:23.790]  And you know, it's like you've really learned what does well and what doesn't well and I feel like every time I see stuff. That's
[47:24.590 --> 47:26.590]  That can make it through the winter
[47:27.550 --> 47:33.870]  I wish cannabis could do that. Oh my god. I wish cannabis could do that. I wish I could like
[47:34.430 --> 47:38.750]  share find a way to share that from the other plants with the cannabis so they
[47:39.470 --> 47:46.430]  They could like adapt to that getting through the winter and the root system survives somehow like the other plants
[47:46.830 --> 47:50.270]  How how does that root system on the other plants survive?
[47:51.390 --> 47:52.990]  Yeah
[47:52.990 --> 47:56.990]  It's amazing adaptation over years, you know, that's part of it for sure
[48:00.010 --> 48:06.010]  I have lemon trees on my roof that are hanging in there. How come cannabis? How come cannabis can't do that?
[48:07.130 --> 48:10.490]  Give it some time. That's what I figured with cannabis. It will adapt
[48:14.090 --> 48:16.090]  And and um
[48:16.250 --> 48:18.250]  Well, we have a special guest

[50:40.750 --> 50:42.750]  So, how do you guys meet the cannabis cup
[50:43.630 --> 50:44.750]  Yes
[50:44.750 --> 50:47.390]  Yeah, like I was reading his books
[50:48.030 --> 50:49.870]  reading his methods
[50:49.870 --> 50:52.750]  um looking at his picture, um
[50:54.430 --> 50:59.630]  Way before I met him and then finally I was at the cannabis cup he was at the
[51:00.830 --> 51:05.630]  Cannabis cup we met i'm just going to get some even though I worry about it
[51:10.030 --> 51:12.030]  Even though I was older than him
[51:12.750 --> 51:14.750]  We we we
[51:16.030 --> 51:18.030]  We got a really good friendship going
[51:19.790 --> 51:22.110]  Yeah, you guys are both characters for sure
[51:22.910 --> 51:30.910]  Yeah, yes. Yes, and we're and i'm almost as sarcastic as he is. I'm but he's more sarcastic than I am
[51:32.030 --> 51:37.810]  I would agree. I would agree, you know, and I think we're you guys are both very very very opinionated
[51:38.190 --> 51:40.990]  You guys might be the two most opinionated people i've ever met
[51:41.790 --> 51:43.790]  I have no opinions about anything
[51:47.070 --> 51:50.270]  He's like my younger brother
[51:53.470 --> 51:55.630]  I know nothing, but
[51:59.230 --> 52:06.430]  I'll never forget when it came into my girl ed came into my oh, no. That was robert clark. That was robert
[52:07.470 --> 52:09.470]  Yeah
[52:10.990 --> 52:12.990]  Very upset
[52:24.190 --> 52:26.190]  You say something and i'll roll a joint
[52:27.950 --> 52:28.910]  Uh
[52:28.910 --> 52:33.550]  So let's talk about what should I say? You mean you can't talk and roll a joint at the same time?
[52:33.710 --> 52:37.710]  Yeah, I can I but i'm looking at which look at this. You see i'm doing it
[52:38.350 --> 52:45.390]  Yeah, i'm doing it too i'm doing it, you know, you know, and this is you know for uh a number of years
[52:46.270 --> 52:48.270]  My assistant who was an mba
[52:48.990 --> 52:50.990]  Uh used to roll my joints
[52:51.790 --> 52:53.790]  And and she left
[52:54.110 --> 52:54.910]  she
[52:54.910 --> 52:58.590]  She she left so I had to roll my start rolling my own
[52:59.550 --> 53:05.230]  Because my new assistant is 300 miles away and she refuses to roll a joint and deliver
[53:05.790 --> 53:08.190]  It I bet your joints have gotten better though
[53:08.910 --> 53:09.870]  Yeah
[53:09.870 --> 53:11.870]  Practice makes perfect. Yeah
[53:12.430 --> 53:15.390]  Yep. Well not in this case, but uh
[53:18.350 --> 53:22.590]  So, yeah, and you've spent a lot of time over there in amsterdam even beyond the cups ed, uh, you know
[53:22.590 --> 53:25.390]  We both hung out. I used to work there. Yeah
[53:26.830 --> 53:29.790]  You know, I had a job for four years where I worked
[53:30.350 --> 53:37.390]  In holland for 12 days and then there were two days traveling and then 28 days in
[53:38.170 --> 53:40.910]  California or not in holland. Yeah
[53:42.270 --> 53:47.230]  Ed hold on james ed just quickly. Can you move your mic down a tiny bit? It's a little hot
[53:52.550 --> 53:54.550]  Is this better?
[53:54.550 --> 53:56.550]  Move the mic away. What?
[53:57.110 --> 54:02.440]  Yeah, move the mic away now. Let's hear you. Okay
[54:03.080 --> 54:05.080]  Yeah much better. Okay, perfect
[54:06.040 --> 54:11.640]  Yeah, you sounded like you were ready to take off in a in a jet pilot style it was a little yeah i'm ready
[54:13.560 --> 54:15.820]  Well, it's a trump effect
[54:26.360 --> 54:28.360]  Okay now do the biden effect
[54:31.880 --> 54:33.880]  That's that's there's no one to sniff
[54:34.520 --> 54:35.880]  There you go
[54:35.880 --> 54:38.680]  You couldn't get that word out. That was a good biden effect
[54:39.320 --> 54:44.360]  But how about a president that can't get the word out? Oh my god. Holy fuck
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.180]  Like as bad as it is here with the lockdown
[54:48.120 --> 54:51.480]  I'm, kind of glad I am here because i'm not that close to biden
[54:53.800 --> 54:55.800]  Well, you're about 3 000 miles away
[54:57.560 --> 55:03.640]  Yeah, that's that's a good that's further than anybody in the u.s can get away I don't know, uh
[55:03.880 --> 55:05.880]  I'm pretty far away from him
[55:06.440 --> 55:08.440]  Yeah
[55:08.600 --> 55:13.640]  But he may land there if he can so I got my two shots
[55:15.800 --> 55:19.480]  No, I wasn't shot twice I got two shots, okay, well
[55:21.240 --> 55:25.320]  Okay, let's skip all this and talk about cannabis, how's that
[55:26.040 --> 55:29.480]  You know, I wanted to I want to mention to all trump people
[55:30.120 --> 55:31.720]  that uh
[55:31.720 --> 55:34.460]  That they should not get a vaccination
[55:35.400 --> 55:38.760]  Because you know, it could be very harmful and instead
[55:39.400 --> 55:41.400]  They should just use opium
[55:42.200 --> 55:44.200]  That protects against coven
[55:44.840 --> 55:46.440]  Oh, man
[55:46.440 --> 55:48.040]  Oh, man. Well
[55:48.040 --> 55:50.040]  Yeah, so originally
[55:50.360 --> 55:54.280]  You know you guys just lost me that just lost me three book sales
[55:54.920 --> 55:56.920]  Yeah
[55:59.640 --> 56:01.480]  But yeah, so
[56:01.480 --> 56:05.660]  When you guys met in the 90s politics were way different even over in amsterdam
[56:06.200 --> 56:09.560]  Uh, but they were much better in amsterdam than they are now
[56:10.040 --> 56:14.440]  Yeah, yeah, definitely better because the the minister of health
[56:15.560 --> 56:22.920]  uh was very pro pot and her son was involved in cannabis and even had a program on
[56:23.240 --> 56:25.240]  radio radio program
[56:25.560 --> 56:27.560]  on cannabis
[56:27.560 --> 56:29.240]  and so
[56:29.240 --> 56:32.140]  They didn't change the laws. They just changed the regulations
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  but major mistake
[56:35.400 --> 56:36.680]  because
[56:36.680 --> 56:39.480]  You don't need legislation to rechange the
[56:40.180 --> 56:43.740]  Rechange it and that's what they did and basically
[56:44.520 --> 56:45.880]  my theory
[56:45.880 --> 56:52.040]  My theory of why a lot of this is going on. Well, first of all, the conservatives are in control
[56:52.920 --> 56:57.160]  And they feel that marijuana is a sin against god
[56:57.960 --> 57:01.000]  So that's the start of it and then
[57:02.200 --> 57:09.080]  As far as amsterdam is concerned amsterdam used to thrive on the hippies and people coming in for pot
[57:09.720 --> 57:11.160]  but now
[57:11.160 --> 57:17.880]  They've up scaled their city and they say we don't want people staying in one and two star hotels anymore
[57:18.200 --> 57:21.020]  We're going to upgrade those to three star hotels
[57:21.420 --> 57:27.340]  We're going to make them into both boutique hotels and stuff and we want a higher grade of tourists
[57:27.660 --> 57:33.040]  We don't want the hippies from the us. We want european tourists who want to see the museums
[57:33.820 --> 57:39.260]  Go to the shows, you know things like go to fine restaurants things like that
[57:39.900 --> 57:41.900]  uh buy diamonds
[57:42.620 --> 57:48.460]  And other jewelry and so that the that's saying to the hippies get out
[57:49.420 --> 57:52.780]  What's your opinion is that that all the hotels
[57:53.820 --> 58:01.100]  Are empty the okara hotel. Everything is empty. Everything's empty. Everything's empty everywhere in the world
[58:03.180 --> 58:05.180]  Empty there too what
[58:05.400 --> 58:13.420]  Everywhere everywhere the whole fucking world the whole world is empty. Lots of hotels are closed. Unfortunately, you know, it's like there's some
[58:15.100 --> 58:17.100]  Not everywhere not in mexico
[58:18.620 --> 58:22.960]  This is where the hotels are the maldi the maldives the maldives
[58:23.820 --> 58:25.820]  They're open but i'm telling you
[58:27.500 --> 58:32.940]  There are hotels that aren't closed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know what they're called, you know what those hotels are called
[58:34.520 --> 58:36.520]  Superspreaders
[58:36.540 --> 58:42.380]  So, you know like the republicans are holding the conservative convention in florida
[58:42.700 --> 58:45.580]  Because it's the only place they could hold it without masks
[58:46.220 --> 58:48.220]  I
[58:48.380 --> 58:52.140]  Ed really I've never been a mask do some research on them
[58:55.100 --> 58:59.820]  How can you acquiesce to that stuff you have to learn to not acquiesce to that stuff
[59:00.940 --> 59:02.540]  You know what?
[59:02.540 --> 59:04.780]  Um, the science is on my side
[59:07.420 --> 59:09.420]  It's as simple as that on my side
[59:09.820 --> 59:11.820]  I know it's not on my side
[59:11.820 --> 59:14.780]  There's no way i'm gonna do that. But anyway, no way i'm gonna

[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.500]  Why?
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.620]  because
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:13.040]  Uh, because they finally got their license
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:18.140]  They they had to uh merge with another company to get it
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:24.940]  but rory finally got his license they didn't want to give him his license because they said he was uh,
[01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:27.260]  morally something or other
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:29.980]  So so let's get back to cannabis, but you know
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.660]  For like 20 years in
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.980]  in sure in ann arbor
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.700]  and they wouldn't
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:43.740]  Give him his license so he had to merge to get his license, but he has his license now
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.060]  so in celebration arbor site
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:53.660]  Okay, well let's talk about cannabis in the 90s again, we will go back to the 90s soma you want to tell us
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.740]  you know
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:01.420]  In amsterdam in the 90s. It was it was somewhat it's decriminalized right and they had coffee shops open
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.380]  And hash was coming on the scene. Hash was okay
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.400]  1997
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:13.500]  I got busted in my old place where I had a big grow room that
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:21.020]  And I had I had about
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:27.420]  30 motherhoods big clone room
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:33.420]  Two different flowering rooms and a small flowering room that had like in
[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:35.420]  In a spiral
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:40.860]  It was like every time I took a plant out. I put another plan in so I had a cycle
[01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.500]  It was endless. It was always going
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:48.060]  Every time I took a plan out. I put a new plan in that was that had been vegging
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:51.500]  So that I could continually harvest something like every week
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.180]  And
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:57.580]  I forgot I forgot why I brought that up then
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:03.020]  Yeah, you were talking about getting busted and when you got busted is that the time you went to
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:09.340]  So there was a there was a hardware store underneath me
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.700]  It was getting it was trying to get broken into
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:17.100]  The police got called and they ended up coming up on my roof
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:20.860]  And coming near to where I had my ventilators taking the air out
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:24.620]  And they went close to it. They heard the fans. They pushed it in
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:28.220]  And the next thing I know I saw a grow light shining on my roof
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:34.540]  So that they and they and they came in through that hole which was on the lower level
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.740]  I locked it
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:40.420]  Oh
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:42.420]  You got a little too
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:47.220]  You got a little too excited there lost soma for a second. So ed, how are you doing good?
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:52.740]  You know, I was busted in holland too for the museum
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:56.180]  So it was a big trial it was a big trial. Yeah
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.260]  and uh
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.260]  And that was in the 90s as well
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:08.660]  Am I they said that by displaying marijuana and things about marijuana? It's endorsing its use. So I said well
[01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:11.940]  What about the torture museum?
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.940]  That you have right on the main street there on the main drag
[01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:20.100]  So if they're displaying torture, is that advocating its use?
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:27.300]  And they bought my argument and then I said that it was against the treaty of rome which guaranteed freedom of speech
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:31.940]  And they didn't know how to deal with that because that's usually not brought up at a trial
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.060]  and
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:38.100]  And I won except they
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:41.380]  They uh found me guilty of
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.440]  possession of under an ounce of marijuana
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.340]  And that's so that they wouldn't have to pay court costs
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.260]  Right
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:57.300]  So someone we got you back. You want to talk about how when you got busted they they let you drink tea in in jail?
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:03.940]  No, no, wait, that's another time but in 97 this time I was talking about before I cut out
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.420]  um
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.860]  I I was talking to the sergeant in the police station
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.380]  And I was telling them that I grew up from my medicine
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:18.580]  And I was two the police station was two blocks away from where my girl room was
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:23.220]  So he said I want I want to walk there with you
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:27.220]  I want to see it
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:32.900]  So he walked over there no handcuffs. No nothing. He walked over there with me from the police station
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:37.060]  Where we were going to run to they can I have a coffee? He said yes
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.140]  Wow
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.380]  Wow
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:46.420]  Where were you going anyway, you know
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:49.380]  Into the canal or what?
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.220]  It's not like that now
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:55.140]  It's not yeah, not like that now here. It was like that in 97, but not now
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:05:00.660]  So I take him into the room. He sees these plants drying on the line
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:04.100]  He asked me for a garbage bag
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:08.580]  I give him a garbage bag. He takes a plant off the line puts it in the garbage
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.540]  Lets me drink my coffee
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:15.700]  Takes the garbage bag walks me back to the police station
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.180]  We walk in he puts the bag in his locker
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.700]  And then we go to his desk
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.940]  And he says i'm gonna i'm gonna write down
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:31.140]  You got permission to grow 50 plants, but don't grow as many as you're growing now
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:33.300]  Make it only 50
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.300]  So I said, okay
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:36.740]  so
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.580]  Then he let me out
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:39.940]  I went back
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:42.580]  I took some plants away so that I had 50
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:46.660]  And from 1997 to 2001, I had no problem
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.700]  Yeah
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:55.860]  Well, and then you were the first person allowed to smoke marijuana in or not smoke but consume cannabis in jail
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:02.660]  Well, it wasn't no government thing it was this sergeant that wrote it for my
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:04.740]  for me
[01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:07.060]  And I saw him write it I had a copy of it
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:14.500]  How official it would have been in court, I don't know but all I know is they never bothered me again
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:17.460]  Wow
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:20.100]  And then in 2001 my landlord
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:24.580]  He ratted on me and that's why and that's why I had to leave the place
[01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:31.370]  Yeah, it excelled that way
[01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:34.490]  But yeah, so
[01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:38.570]  Variety, you know, you guys want to tell tell us a story about uh,
[01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:43.770]  Something that you guys did together back a long time ago. I know you got some good stories ed
[01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:47.660]  about soma
[01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:50.140]  Well, um
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.780]  Okay
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.100]  When he was staying
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.820]  When when he was staying at my house
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:02.460]  He would have this little ritual of making a smoothie in the morning
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.980]  And so the first thing he would consume would be a
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.660]  smoothie
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:12.940]  Not bacon and eggs, but a smoothie, you know, and not even coffee but a smoothie and so
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:16.780]  I kind of watched him do that and I thought hey i'm going to try that
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:19.580]  I'm going to see what it feels like if I start the day with a smoothie. So
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:23.920]  I still do that a lot and for a while. I did it continually
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.500]  And that's one thing I picked up from him

[01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:23.630]  Jimmy
[01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:29.550]  How do you make your butter do you do a traditional do you still boil it down? Yep. Can you hear us now?
[01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:40.270]  Um, yeah, I made some today and I use organic coconut oil and organic ralted butter
[01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:43.710]  I do it about 50 50
[01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:48.030]  Yeah, and I do it in a pressure cook I do it in a pressure cooker
[01:09:50.190 --> 01:09:53.550]  I I put first I first I toast the cannabis
[01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:59.790]  Then I put the butter in the coconut oil in then I put two liters of vas water in
[01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:04.190]  And put it in the pressure cooker and I pressure cook it for an hour
[01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:07.870]  The water cleans all the dirt out of the weed
[01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:11.630]  And all the thc goes into the butter and the coconut oil
[01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:17.470]  Right now it's sitting on my roof getting cold in the morning i'll open it up
[01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:24.350]  Take the leaf and the oil it'll be on top floating on top i'll put that in another pot
[01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:27.150]  Eat it again
[01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.870]  Let a little bit of water that's in it boil off
[01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:32.750]  And then i'll strain it through a strainer
[01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:37.630]  To get all the material out and then i'll just have the
[01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:40.510]  the coconut oil and the butter
[01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:42.910]  Mixed with the thc
[01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:50.190]  No, and what I do one of my favorite things what I do is that I take this organic chocolate spread
[01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:56.030]  That's like it comes like in a peanut butter jar kind of and i'll open up
[01:10:57.150 --> 01:10:58.910]  Take some of it out
[01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:00.910]  Put my butter in
[01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:02.910]  Mix it up with the chocolate
[01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:08.350]  and you can just eat it right out of the jar like that and share it and
[01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:13.150]  It's I I usually take it to to the zalver sauna

[01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:46.430]  So going to the spa after eating that's great, too, you know and ed, how do you make your butter?
[01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:48.670]  I know you got your own butter recipe as well
[01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:52.190]  I don't do that. I just use stardust
[01:11:53.070 --> 01:12:00.030]  Oh, yeah, you've got your own product right the yeah that blends in the water. It's a maltose dextrose married to a
[01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:02.990]  Thc molecule. Yeah
[01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:06.110]  Yep, it's but it's not full spectrum
[01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:09.470]  No
[01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:14.190]  Nice no, it isn't but it but you know
[01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:20.110]  Like it's really easy to use though. Sure you open it up
[01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:24.590]  Pour it into a hot drink and drink so
[01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:32.350]  Yeah, you know, I guess it could be there's no reason why I couldn't why uh, the recipe couldn't be a
[01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:35.630]  Full spectrum recipe as long as it was oils
[01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:39.470]  Yeah, yeah
[01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:41.470]  That would be cool. Yeah
[01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:46.670]  And then someone's got a video on his hash candy, I believe somewhere someone just pointed it out on our chat
[01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:50.030]  But there's a video on how you make your hash candy. So if anybody's interested
[01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:53.950]  Yeah, I do look at this water hash
[01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:59.070]  Wait, let me see. Where am I? Oh, yeah here
[01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:02.670]  Um
[01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:04.670]  Um, yeah
[01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:09.070]  I'm gonna hit it with the lighter
[01:13:20.290 --> 01:13:22.290]  Oh, yeah
[01:13:22.290 --> 01:13:25.010]  Some serious melt action going on here
[01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:32.930]  And it's full melt it's just full melt if I put it in the pipe it just melts right away
[01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:39.650]  And it's just it's it's still one of my favorite favorite things
[01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:47.410]  To smoke it's like full melt water hash that's made from a good organic weed. I love it
[01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:53.720]  Yeah
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.640]  So, yeah, what are you smoking on right now? What what variety is that again?
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:07.320]  Um this this one this water hash is um amnesia nice amnesia makes really nice water
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.520]  Really nice. Yeah
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:15.480]  And then ed what are you smoking on there in california ed actually looks close
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.560]  Right now, um
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.680]  um smoking a
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.800]  gg4 female
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.040]  uh, it was uh times a
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.400]  um
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:39.880]  Uh, uh plant that was called fire stick. I forget the name of the uh seed company
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.760]  and I cross those two and that's
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.640]  i'm smoking the cross
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:54.920]  and the fire stick is uh is uh, it has some uh sativa characteristics, but it's uh faster, so
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.520]  So someone said fresh frozen or cured selma
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:08.280]  What's your opinion and you selma also makes his own hash as well his water hash i've experienced that as well
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.360]  So
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:17.880]  Really good bubble. Yeah, i'm gonna i'm gonna fire some up for in a second here. Let's see
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:26.760]  Oh, yeah, soma used to use the washing machine washing machine tech back in the day with the bubble bags
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:31.640]  And I don't know how long you've been making hash. Selma. How long have you been making it?
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.840]  Well, I started making it in
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:39.400]  1997 I think I was always making finger hash
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:46.040]  before that when I was manicuring I'd always get finger hash and that's the first kind of hash I made but
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:50.200]  97 is when I started making water hash with mila's bags
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.280]  Yummy smells great
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:25.360]  So you guys and where do you guys see cannabis in the next 10 years, you know if uh, you could look into the crystal miraculous
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:30.740]  The most miraculous medicine that ever hit humankind
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.880]  Recognized everywhere in every way
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.500]  how about uh
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:42.160]  Legalization you guys you see it some on a world view as something that's going to be more accepted
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.560]  Across the board we would assume so correct
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.760]  Well, I believe that the rule of law has to come
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.400]  back into play on the planet
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.480]  I believe that the whole financial system has to have an over
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.360]  uh
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.200]  What do you call it?
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.640]  like
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:10.000]  An overhaul the whole like we need a quantum financial system to come in and replace this one. That doesn't work
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:17.840]  We can't keep going trillions and trillions and trillions dollars in debt and expect to make anything good happen
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.080]  so a lot
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.240]  a lot of things have to get corrected first
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.320]  and then
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:27.280]  Cannabis can really skyrocket in every which way
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.200]  Yep ed, how do you feel about that?
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.360]  Well
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:41.360]  Next 10 years. What do you what do you say? Well, it's going to be legal in
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.440]  uh
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:44.640]  the major
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.240]  in countries
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:49.200]  In of the world where the majority of people live
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.600]  I think it will be legalized in india again
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.760]  and also, uh throughout europe
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.120]  and south america and
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.920]  north and south america
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.560]  and parts of asia, it's about
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:12.880]  Parts of asia, so that's what and it's about to get legal in londonburg soon
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.600]  I heard that
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.440]  That's amazing
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.440]  as far as uh medically
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:24.160]  That's a different story there I I agree with soma
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:30.080]  That it will be recognized worldwide for its many uses as medicine
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:35.920]  And different components of it, but that doesn't mean that the plants will be grown for it
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.400]  for instance if they
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.400]  know a particular
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.000]  cannabinoid
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.320]  is useful for something they might
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.040]  transfer the genes to
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.680]  A yeast and just produce that
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:51.760]  and
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.760]  It's a lot easier to produce a
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.160]  product
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:02.480]  To produce it as a product of fermentation than having to grow the plant and then refine it
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.120]  So I think that's what will happen is it?
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:12.880]  And they're already, you know, that's already happening. We're not talking about future science. They're already playing with
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.560]  producing thc and yeast
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.520]  Yeah
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.200]  So so
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.660]  But those that but there will be a lot of specialized medicines
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:33.280]  Uh that come from that as well as you being used holistically and as an herb rather than a drug
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:40.960]  I think when we're talking about those medicines those specific medicines that are being that are manufactured like from
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:45.200]  yeast or something we're talking about a drug and when we're
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:50.640]  Talking about a refine the herb or
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:59.280]  A concentration of the herb or sometimes an extraction we're talking about herbs not
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.840]  Drugs, so there's a difference. I think there'll be uses for both
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:08.800]  I think some of the specialized things will approach different
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.200]  ailments that
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.200]  affect a lot of humans
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:15.600]  Weight regulation
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.600]  for one thing because
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:20.500]  worldwide, you know, obey obesity
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:25.300]  Is a it's it's a worldwide. Um pandemic
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.160]  and uh, I think that
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:29.680]  uh
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:35.520]  Cannabis is intimately related with satiation and uh, how much people eat
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:41.140]  They had you know, they had a they had a drug that was an anti-thc
[01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:48.580]  And what it did was it was a diet drug and what it did it made people
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.580]  um
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.500]  not hungry
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:58.660]  And when I was at the science conference before the drug came on the market the scientists
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:02.420]  Not from that company, but other scientists at this
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:07.060]  At the icrs at that time said, you know, this drug is going to kill people
[01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:12.740]  People are going to commit suicide from it and sure enough the drug came on the market and
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:15.620]  People reduce their weight a little bit
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:22.020]  but there was such a significant number of suicides for the small number of people using it that they
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:24.580]  that everything that the uh
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:30.580]  Scientist said was true that that if you put a reverse thc into people
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.680]  It will make them
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.680]  unregulated and messed up
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.140]  And and suicidal
[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:45.780]  Yeah, i'm looking forward to the next five years in cannabis and seeing where we go with stuff
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:51.220]  I mean, I think there's just so many directions and as it becomes less regulated and easier to study
[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:54.980]  You know places like israel are really kind of pushing and paving the way
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:59.460]  For uh drugs and clinical clinical research studies. I mean, I think
[01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:02.260]  Dr. Daddy, miri is just really pushing
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.460]  Imagine if japan says
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:07.460]  Yeah
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:09.620]  I I honestly think that'll happen. I feel like I know
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:17.860]  I think I think it would be more likely in china because they're really into pharmaceuticals more than japan is yeah
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:23.220]  Oh china china will definitely happen, but I know a lot of japanese people these days
[01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:28.500]  And I believe soon it's going to happen in japan right now. They're working on the cbd part
[01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:32.180]  What part what when you say it's going to happen? What do you mean?
[01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:36.260]  I mean, I mean what when you say it's going to happen are you talking about?
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.120]  agriculturally or
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:46.580]  Scientifically or well the way it's happening right now the way it's happening right now is I I have friends
[01:22:47.060 --> 01:22:50.660]  That have their multi-millionaire japanese people and they have a company
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:53.320]  That's starting to put tbd
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:59.380]  In many different ingredients in different foods and starting to market it in japan
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:06.360]  So it's like it's like it's like the it's like the phrase come for the cbd stay for the thc
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:12.100]  so right now in japan the cbd market starts to open up and
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:20.260]  Not only japanese citizenry, but japanese government starts to get open to the cbd medical aspect of it
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:24.100]  As an ingredient in different foods, that's how it's starting
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:26.580]  but I believe that eventually
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:33.060]  It will open up to a point where they actually grow it there make their own cbd right there in japan
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:34.900]  and
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:39.620]  Also start working with this thc, you know, you know, they already grow hemp there
[01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:41.780]  Hmm
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:44.500]  They grow yeah, and they did hundreds of years ago
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:50.100]  Was a big hemp producer they grow they grow hemp. Um
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:54.260]  For uh for fiber, it's a very fine
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:24:01.300]  Fiber uh, and it's for clothing and um, I don't know if they still do but they used to
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:05.220]  Uh the day when people died they were wrapped in hemp
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:07.780]  And or it was used
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:18.100]  And I have a hemp I have a japanese hemp road that uh, I picked up yeah
[01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:27.140]  And uh, so I mean they have a history of using hemp I think the it was grown maybe in the prefecture of uh,
[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:29.860]  this the island of
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:33.380]  Hikado I think it was
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:42.280]  Anyway, but uh, but in china, uh, you know, I was there a few years ago and they have a thriving
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:44.160]  um
[01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:46.160]  Scrappy pharmaceutical
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:50.480]  Big pharmaceutical companies little ones. I went to an herb company
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.600]  You know and on their they were growing the herbs that they were
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.840]  making
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.400]  Into medicines they were growing them on the campus
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.420]  You know like like right at the factory
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.640]  Yeah, yeah
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.400]  Yeah, I know in china two years ago
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:18.960]  I was approached by someone from the ministry of agriculture after one of my lectures and they were interested in uh purchasing hemp seed
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.760]  And so, you know, I think they're definitely
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.320]  on their way to becoming a super
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.320]  power with
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:30.320]  Sea ducks. Oh, yeah, it's gonna go fast. It's gonna it's trying to go fast
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.480]  Every japanese person that I meet here
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:37.600]  They love cannabis with a passion
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:42.480]  Everyone, uh, well almost everyone you meet
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:48.160]  Yeah, think about it some almost everyone
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:51.680]  Yeah
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:56.800]  But but look if you run a cannabis gym if you run a cannabis gym like I do
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:03.840]  Like, you know people people come in and they see somebody working out with the weights and
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:09.120]  And and then they they try it and they usually can't lift the same weights I can
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:10.880]  and
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:14.560]  but eventually they do they work out with me a few times and
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:20.060]  every
[01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:30.910]  You're cutting out so
[01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:33.550]  Can we you back
[01:26:35.230 --> 01:26:37.230]  Yeah, can you hear me
[01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:41.710]  We can hear you now we lost you for a hot second there when you're talking about lifting weights
[01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:48.830]  Oh, yeah, because I got a cannabis gym, so i'm always i'm always working out here and when
[01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:54.910]  Whenever anybody comes to visit me they see me working out and they go i'll try it
[01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:59.870]  And before you know it two hours goes by and they can finally leave but you know
[01:27:00.510 --> 01:27:02.510]  People start loving can
[01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:06.750]  Yeah
[01:27:07.150 --> 01:27:08.190]  Yeah
[01:27:08.190 --> 01:27:09.310]  each other
[01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:14.430]  We smoke like for like a half hour at least a half hour straight. You must do the same thing with them
[01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:20.430]  He's smoking right now, but I know what i'm with him. We're smoking for at least half hour trying this
[01:27:22.590 --> 01:27:24.590]  Oh, yeah
[01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:34.510]  You know, I only smoke once a day ed's lying only once a day
[01:27:37.710 --> 01:27:39.710]  Starting in the morning
[01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:49.870]  Yeah, I think that's when we get along
[01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:52.350]  we all smoke a lot
[01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:55.150]  you know, there's people that are all about the money and there's people that are
[01:27:56.030 --> 01:28:02.350]  About cannabis and then there's you know, there's some mix of it, but it's like you guys I know a lot of coffee shop people
[01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:04.670]  Yep
[01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:07.150]  I know coffee shop people that don't smoke
[01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:10.030]  Sure, it's their business
[01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:17.470]  And you know what and when I show them I have a corollary to that. I know people who don't own coffee shops
[01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:19.710]  Who do smoke?
[01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:22.350]  This is true. Yeah
[01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:26.670]  Well me too me too like
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.160]  Yeah
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:37.240]  So yeah, I got some so soma when are you going to revise your book?
[01:28:40.130 --> 01:28:42.130]  Yeah, I saw that
[01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:45.090]  Got some auto flower pollen
[01:28:45.650 --> 01:28:47.650]  Yeah, so so
[01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:53.010]  When are you going to revise your book auto flower pollen, but yeah
[01:28:53.730 --> 01:28:57.970]  Yeah, so let's talk about soma's book. So just you guys don't have to talk about
[01:28:59.010 --> 01:29:02.690]  And and ed is soma's book. Soma's book is available on amazon, correct?
[01:29:03.730 --> 01:29:06.770]  I don't know how available it is because uh
[01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:12.530]  It's um, it's not out of print, but there's not nothing available right right now
[01:29:12.850 --> 01:29:15.650]  We're going to read we're going to do a reprint
[01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:17.410]  soon
[01:29:17.410 --> 01:29:19.410]  Nice. Yeah
[01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:21.490]  Yeah
[01:29:21.490 --> 01:29:23.490]  so
[01:29:23.490 --> 01:29:25.490]  Anyway, that's what's gonna happen
[01:29:27.010 --> 01:29:33.570]  So, yeah for those you don't know you know what you see but it's it's embarrassing to sell it because it's too old
[01:29:33.650 --> 01:29:35.650]  That's the whole thing
[01:29:35.650 --> 01:29:41.330]  You know what? I mean? I don't know a lot of people like it even even though it's old. I I know like I
[01:29:41.890 --> 01:29:46.850]  I understand it. I'm just telling you how I feel about it. I'm telling talking. Um, yeah
[01:29:47.490 --> 01:29:49.490]  I'm revealing my inner soul
[01:29:50.050 --> 01:29:51.570]  here
[01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:58.850]  So, okay, you you can't deny what my feelings about it and I feel I feel embarrassed to sell it
[01:29:59.410 --> 01:30:01.090]  because it's
[01:30:01.090 --> 01:30:05.250]  Embarrassed to sell it because it's too old and it's out of date
[01:30:06.130 --> 01:30:08.130]  That's that's why
[01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:10.130]  I'm, not selling any 19
[01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:12.350]  2019 calendars either
[01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:19.050]  And what about your your older books you still sell them right no
[01:30:20.410 --> 01:30:25.370]  No, no, they're always revised. Yes. James. I'm always revising them
[01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:30.010]  Yeah, I feel like I I
[01:30:30.090 --> 01:30:35.050]  Understand what you're saying I value to an older book in some regard like with some of stuff but yeah
[01:30:35.050 --> 01:30:38.410]  there's new updated constantly new information coming out and I feel like
[01:30:39.130 --> 01:30:43.370]  It would be great to get an updated version of your book so much. You have so much to contribute as well
[01:30:46.090 --> 01:30:51.930]  Just on grow lights there could be like a whole section on on grow lights that didn't even exist when I wrote that book
[01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:56.890]  Right exactly. So, you know, you wouldn't use a 20 year old computer book
[01:30:57.290 --> 01:31:02.810]  And now and now I make my own soil mix that I start to market here
[01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:06.490]  Awesome. I sure wasn't doing that when I wrote this. Oh
[01:31:07.130 --> 01:31:09.530]  Yeah, do you want to talk about your soil mixture a little bit?
[01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:15.250]  Me yeah, so, um, let me see if I have it
[01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:23.130]  What you got some really good products to talk about as well well I have the pesticide
[01:31:23.690 --> 01:31:29.690]  Made from cinnamon clove rosemary and thyme oil and it's more approved and then I have
[01:31:31.530 --> 01:31:36.410]  Fungicide just like sort of like that slightly different ingredients and
[01:31:38.730 --> 01:31:46.490]  The fungicide is also a preventative and then I'm coming out with the soil so
[01:31:48.170 --> 01:31:51.130]  Vital it's coming. I'm doing it with vital
[01:31:52.130 --> 01:31:54.130]  Yeah, I know Brian
[01:31:55.050 --> 01:32:02.850]  Yep, we can see it super soil awesome. So what is in the super the Soma super soil blend?
[01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:10.470]  Well, if you if you took this what's in this box and
[01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:14.390]  You mixed it with Pete Pete Moss
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:21.580]  You would have a perfect soil to flowering
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:30.820]  Nice and it organic too. So you got some living organ in there as well and
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:35.500]  What's that
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:40.900]  So the soil is alive. I said the soil is alive, correct? Yes
[01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:46.230]  Knowing you it's a really good organic product
[01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:55.230]  This um this this soil that I use
[01:32:56.790 --> 01:33:00.830]  The only thing I do is put a little bit of guano on guano tea on at the end
[01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:03.350]  I don't have to do it. I don't have to give it anything
[01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:08.110]  It just and it's rich stays loose. It stays airy the whole time
[01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:11.670]  Nice I
[01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:17.990]  Mean yeah, yeah, there's perlite in the mix too. You know, there's a lot of perlite in the mix besides the Pete
[01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:20.830]  hmm
[01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:25.430]  Excellent. So Ed's got a soil too. He's working on that's gonna be released later this year Ed
[01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:31.430]  Yeah, I think this spring I think it's coming it's I
[01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:39.630]  Don't know if it's a just yet, but really soon so and it has its base is coir
[01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:47.390]  Yeah, and it doesn't have any perlite or anything that you can't put back put into the soil
[01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:50.030]  And you know have it become part of the soil
[01:33:50.670 --> 01:33:56.950]  So and I don't use I don't use peat moss because it has no
[01:33:56.950 --> 01:34:03.590]  Oh, those are beautiful roots really? Yeah, I like to grow these nice root balls
[01:34:04.110 --> 01:34:05.390]  Yeah
[01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:10.910]  And and then I dry and then I dry them out and this one is from a year ago. It's really nice
[01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:15.070]  so so I don't use any
[01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:21.390]  Peat moss because it's a wetland product and coir is you know, we saw
[01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:26.110]  It's
[01:34:26.110 --> 01:34:33.670]  Renewable and it's recyclable. So I like that and it has all these other ingredients in it that I
[01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:35.670]  made
[01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:38.110]  to make the soil sort of like a
[01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:43.030]  That it's it is a living soil it has all
[01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:48.790]  All organic ingredients alfalfa and different
[01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:53.710]  Different ground minerals such as
[01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:59.790]  ground granite things like that as well as other nutrients in it, so I
[01:35:00.630 --> 01:35:06.670]  Don't want to go through it. Everything's on the label. So yeah, I don't want to waste our time with that
[01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:11.430]  but yeah, it grows really nice plants and it's all organic and
[01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:16.590]  It supports, you know the micro
[01:35:17.950 --> 01:35:19.950]  microflora, so
[01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:22.790]  So Selma you showed us some really cool roots
[01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:27.950]  You got to talk tell us about the roots you just used to do exposed roots when you grew as well
[01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:32.630]  I always do it. I always do it like I find you get a better plant and
[01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:36.190]  Then you also get this at the end
[01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:40.630]  Which I have quite a few of these and I find that
[01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:43.510]  They make nice room pieces
[01:35:43.670 --> 01:35:50.030]  They look like electric wires and you think about the root system how it's like so electrical actually
[01:35:51.310 --> 01:35:58.470]  You know, it's it's a lot like our nervous system or something. You know, it's like I really like looking at it and
[01:35:59.150 --> 01:36:01.470]  Once it dries it's pretty durable
[01:36:03.150 --> 01:36:07.950]  Yeah, it's really cool it's it's it's art and it's it's most natural form
[01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:13.990]  So someone had a question about you do you use roots you make tea with your roots
[01:36:15.190 --> 01:36:17.990]  No, you know, but I want to learn
[01:36:18.990 --> 01:36:21.310]  More ways that I can use the roots
[01:36:22.150 --> 01:36:29.030]  You know, I use them like this as an art piece, but I haven't used them as a medicine or
[01:36:29.790 --> 01:36:32.510]  You know, I know you can make a little whisk room with them
[01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:37.430]  If you if you train them when they're wet, you can make a little whisk room
[01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:39.430]  but I
[01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:41.430]  Want to learn more about the roots?
[01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:46.110]  Well, yeah, they I mean they have cannabinoids and they definitely have strong terpenes
[01:36:46.110 --> 01:36:50.510]  I don't you guys have probably both smelled root balls that smell amazing after harvesting
[01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:55.790]  Even this one has a smell still
[01:36:56.390 --> 01:37:02.420]  the roots
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:04.420]  Awesome
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:07.300]  So Ed, why don't you tell us a little story about soma?
[01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:14.460]  Going back. I mean there's there's a ton of them. I know but pick one of your favorite stories about soma
[01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:29.830]  Well, I I mean it's um, you know
[01:37:31.870 --> 01:37:38.950]  Just watching somas life for a day is just fascinating the number of people that he sees
[01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:44.150]  And you know, this isn't any particular story it's just
[01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:51.870]  It's just the portrait of his life and how he lives his life is
[01:37:54.710 --> 01:37:56.030]  It's
[01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:57.710]  just a
[01:37:57.710 --> 01:37:59.710]  fascinating tapestry of
[01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:01.950]  between the people
[01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:07.190]  That he meets the work that he's doing the way he lives his personal life
[01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:10.510]  This beautiful woven tapestry
[01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:13.150]  Thank you
[01:38:13.150 --> 01:38:15.510]  And you know ed you're one of my
[01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:20.530]  You were one of my role models
[01:38:21.130 --> 01:38:27.210]  Because you're an elder for me and I've been watching you age for 25 years or so
[01:38:27.570 --> 01:38:29.570]  you know as a friend not just
[01:38:30.130 --> 01:38:32.130]  okay, your books and
[01:38:33.330 --> 01:38:38.210]  Yeah, you inspire me in many different ways the whole time I know you right up till now
[01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:42.770]  Well, I don't think of myself as aging right now
[01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:48.730]  No, you look at me that beard looks good. I like that beard a lot. I'm gonna die it
[01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:53.290]  Keep it keep it
[01:38:55.090 --> 01:39:01.650]  You know, I'm getting prepared with my new publication I'm getting prepared
[01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:03.650]  Very
[01:39:07.730 --> 01:39:14.730]  With my new publication I'm going to have the million seed giveaway
[01:39:15.770 --> 01:39:17.250]  and
[01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:24.050]  James is going to help with that as a matter of fact, and so but I'm going to go to different parts of
[01:39:24.490 --> 01:39:29.850]  California and then to Colorado, but I'll have a different seed stock there
[01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:35.970]  I'm not traveling with the seeds. Oh across state lines. So but
[01:39:37.090 --> 01:39:42.330]  I'm going to in different localities. I'm going to give people six seeds
[01:39:43.090 --> 01:39:44.530]  that they
[01:39:44.530 --> 01:39:45.650]  can
[01:39:45.650 --> 01:39:50.930]  Start and you know, some of them will be males. I mean some of them will be
[01:39:51.930 --> 01:39:55.810]  You know, they'll and there'll be different varieties mixed. It will be
[01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:59.210]  Sort of random for each area
[01:39:59.410 --> 01:40:04.690]  But the idea is to get people on their first six. How many seeds did you say?
[01:40:05.090 --> 01:40:08.490]  Six, no, no all together a million
[01:40:09.210 --> 01:40:12.490]  Okay, so that's like that's like 20 kilos
[01:40:13.330 --> 01:40:15.330]  Yeah
[01:40:15.370 --> 01:40:19.130]  Yeah, well I committed I committed at least a pound of seeds for Ed. Yeah
[01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:24.610]  So we'll we did he's gonna homogenize everything. So his plan is to take all the seeds
[01:40:25.050 --> 01:40:31.170]  Mix them together and then give them out six to a person all across the state. I think it's a great idea
[01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:34.530]  Well, you have to you have to say that you're not gonna get any enemies
[01:40:37.530 --> 01:40:43.990]  You're gonna mix them all like like maybe like okay, you gotta make sure they're all good to start with then I guess
[01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:47.450]  Well, look, let's say you were growing tomatoes, right?
[01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:51.450]  Yeah, growing a few plants. I love growing tomato
[01:40:51.970 --> 01:40:55.250]  Would you grow the same variety or would you grow different varieties
[01:40:55.770 --> 01:41:00.170]  Me I like growing cherry tomatoes because they're so damn easy and so easy to eat
[01:41:00.730 --> 01:41:06.050]  But there are different kinds of cherry tomatoes. Do you know the same? Yeah, I know that's what I'm saying
[01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:08.050]  Would you grow this?
[01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:10.730]  Way wait, wouldn't you grow different varieties?
[01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:16.250]  You know if you're growing for yourself you'd rather grow different varieties, right
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:33.420]  I'm going to have a green green hair and a green beard and I'm going to wear a
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:42.660]  Some sort of a green costume maybe my wizard costume my green with translucent
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:47.980]  This is a this is the kind I like to grow the best
[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:52.900]  Yeah, but there are all kinds of cherry tomatoes. Yeah. Yeah, but this particular
[01:41:53.740 --> 01:42:00.700]  Strain I really like yeah. Well, you should try this strain called Juliet. He can buy the seed
[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:03.860]  I love tomatoes. I love yeah, so
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:09.100]  Anyway first I thought that that
[01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:13.660]  the first place that I would do it is down south, but
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:16.940]  You know like Southern California, but now I
[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:19.980]  Figure well, why not?
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:26.300]  Go for low-hanging fruit and there's this city right next to where I live. It's called
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:28.940]  I don't know if you've heard of it James. It's called
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:31.900]  Oakland
[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:33.900]  Oakland
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:43.700]  Yeah, so I thought right I I thought I thought I'd
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:47.100]  How about Oakland first, right? I
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:49.860]  Mean it's easiest, right
[01:42:50.380 --> 01:42:52.380]  Yeah, you don't have to
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:55.620]  So Oakland is kind of like a war zone right now
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:43:00.260]  There's a lot of crime and all kinds of stuff. They could probably use it not even probably
[01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:07.300]  Well, I think doing okay, you know as long as long as you're well to do it's okay to be in Oakland
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:09.980]  Yeah, as long as you're not in the wrong place
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:15.420]  I mean I see every day and I see people getting robbed and my friend was held up a gunpoint two weeks ago
[01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:16.580]  you know, it's
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:21.580]  It's kind of well, well, you know when people have no money that that happens
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:22.660]  I mean
[01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:24.260]  I mean like
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:30.420]  You know one way or another through no fault of their own a lot of people are desperate right now
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:36.620]  And you know the way I see it in the United States. There are two groups of people right now
[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:39.220]  those who have
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:41.580]  three groups
[01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:49.380]  Those who have been hurt by by the pandemic and the resulting, you know closures and things
[01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:51.420]  then
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:55.460]  those who it hasn't affected one way or another and
[01:43:56.100 --> 01:44:01.020]  The third group is a group that's benefited from it. And so
[01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:08.500]  You know if you're in the first group the group that has been hurt by it
[01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:13.580]  You're pretty desperate because there isn't any income coming in and there's
[01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:21.420]  You know and the debating over a $1,500 check how much of your rent would that cover James?
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:24.500]  Not a lot
[01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:26.580]  Okay, so a big
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:32.500]  Big $1,500 check. I mean here are these people with kids and everything
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:35.780]  Desperate and the landlord saying knock knock
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:39.580]  Here's the eviction notice and they don't have money for you to feed the kids
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:42.180]  Yeah, I
[01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:48.860]  Don't know if you're experiencing the Netherlands yet. Oh, it's terrible here. It's terrible here the
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:51.900]  homelessness in Oakland is
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:55.980]  Incredible. No, it's not it's not like that with the homeless here
[01:44:55.980 --> 01:44:59.540]  But there's more homeless now than I ever used to see well
[01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:01.980]  Homeless encampments in Oakland
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:09.580]  A hundred and you know, I believe you know, you ever play musical chairs when you're a kid
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:14.140]  I used to love it. Okay. Okay. He laughed well
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:20.100]  Well except for one thing if there isn't enough housing to go around. Oh
[01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:22.980]  I don't know
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:26.500]  But but if there isn't enough housing to go around
[01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:31.260]  Somebody is in tows, right? Yeah, you have people who are making
[01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:36.780]  $200,000 a year who are living in RV camps in
[01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:39.780]  in
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:46.820]  Down the peninsula like where Google and Apple and all those companies are I mean that I mean
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:52.900]  There's no housing when that when they built their campuses. They know they didn't build housing
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:57.060]  People are living in what would in other places be
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:05.180]  substandard housing and paying enormous rents is just not enough and then the people who are living in that
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:09.300]  Housing they were kicked out for these higher paying
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:14.420]  Unbelievable Google and Apple have shuttle buses going
[01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:19.380]  Picking people up from the camps and they're just not enough
[01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:21.380]  Shuttle buses going
[01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:25.300]  Picking people up from their residence in San Francisco
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:31.220]  Taking him down the peninsula to imagine what that does to housing. It's just not enough housing
[01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:36.580]  See Holland didn't you used to have that they housed everybody
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:41.420]  They still pretty much house everybody. There's not so many homeless still
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:47.920]  Yeah, and the conditions are a lot harsher there too, you know as far as weather so
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:51.920]  Well, wait a second wait hold it
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:53.880]  Mm-hmm
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:59.240]  Did you see what happened to the all of the United States this past two weeks?
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:03.320]  Yeah, no freezing weather. Oh, yeah
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:11.920]  We're we're in La La Land sort of you know, we're in a buffer zone here. Yeah James, you don't you know
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:21.040]  Yeah, and here to read like we did have some ice two weeks ago, but it was only a week and it was gone
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:23.360]  No
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:26.600]  Yeah, aren't they doing the that?
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:33.400]  Canal thing in another now. It only lasted for about a day. So it didn't last long
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:36.120]  No, but don't they do it in another country now?
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:41.680]  Don't the skaters actually skate in Poland or something I didn't hear that I didn't hear that
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:49.880]  yeah, I think they they have a substitute for you know, I mean it's not canal to canal but
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:54.840]  Maybe they should do maybe they should do with water skis
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:01.040]  Okay
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:03.040]  Yes
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:07.160]  You keep on creeping up it wants to kiss me so
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:12.800]  So, yeah, so guys we've all been to Barcelona together let's talk about Spanabus
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:18.280]  I left Spanabus in a hurry and I don't believe either you guys went last year some good move on your part
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:20.480]  But uh, I warned you
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:24.920]  Everybody warned me. Yep, and I warned you I said don't go and
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:31.800]  So me you've been to Spanabus so many times, but you didn't go last year. Yes. I started going
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:34.320]  2004
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:36.320]  first year
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:39.980]  I only go once in a while. I went every year up until
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.160]  2015
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:45.480]  yeah, I go once in a while and I
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:52.480]  I watched it grow. I watched it get really good. I won first prize there in
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:56.000]  2007 I still have a real silver cup
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:02.920]  Like of all the prizes I the actual prizes not the titles but the prizes that I ever won
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:05.480]  the cup that I won in
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:07.720]  2007 at Spanabus is
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.960]  Sterling silver and it's big. It's like a racing car cup
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:14.280]  amazing
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:19.480]  Good times, you know, so that's where you know, I've had some really amazing experiences in Barcelona
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:24.760]  The my favorite hotel you introduced me to my favorite hotel, which is my favorite hotel to
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:27.240]  La Florida
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:30.180]  That's written. I can tell that's the way up in the hills
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:38.760]  Ed's been there too. Tibidabo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't particularly like it for this reason
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:45.320]  Convention I want to be more centered. Oh, yes far away you go
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.560]  It's GU, you know, you know GU right
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:54.840]  No, you know, it's you do you
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:58.960]  Geographically undesirable I
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:07.120]  Understand what you're saying. I feel like it's a retreat. I feel when I go there when I'm not going for this I go there
[01:50:08.080 --> 01:50:13.640]  Okay, but I know you're saying if you're talking about going to Spanabus, it's you know, that's your it's an hour plus trek
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:19.240]  To get over to Spanabus. Oh, I forgot my phone. I have to go back and get it
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:22.200]  That's four hours, okay
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:29.640]  Yeah, and the best Thai restaurant in the world is in Barcelona they've changed the name though, right it used to be
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:36.160]  Yeah, Thai Gardens that that was it yeah, and they tried I would last time I was there last year
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:42.360]  They had changed the name of it, but still the same food floor or had the seats are in the floor
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:45.320]  Yeah, the same seats
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:47.560]  Yeah, I was there on mushrooms with you one year it was
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:52.120]  Everyone was talking like all these different languages to me. I think they're all talking
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:01.320]  Real wild experience. So yeah, our buddy ABBA is still over there. He's doing well
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:06.040]  Considering the you know the issues with the
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:09.960]  Oh, yeah, it made me really sad
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:14.480]  Oh, yeah, I made me really sad
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:17.920]  Maybe I'm really sad. I had I kind of like
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:20.640]  He was only 50 years old
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:23.200]  I know I know
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:28.480]  And it's like I had to do a double take because I didn't really know his last name very good
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:33.840]  And so I had a like looking and then I got really sad, you know
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.320]  I
[01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:39.240]  Spoke with him just a month ago
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:44.520]  He was a good guy, you know, it was really
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:50.180]  A lot of work around Temp Creek for the last 10 years or so
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:54.880]  He was I mean a real
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:59.680]  You know like my proponent of it, you know, yeah
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:01.920]  so
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:03.920]  Yeah
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:09.320]  That was so it was shocking because you know who you wouldn't expect that but he died
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:12.520]  Yeah
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:20.960]  Yeah, we've lost we've lost quite a few people in the last year in the industry, you know sub passed away it's oh

[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:08.440]  Yeah, you know he he had some sort of
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:13.560]  Chronic progressive
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:24.720]  Disorder that this disrupted his metabolism. Yeah and cause seizures and things like that
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:27.400]  Yeah
[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:29.400]  We saw he was a nice guy
[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:36.240]  What people don't know about him is both he and Shara his wife were
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:38.800]  were also
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:40.800]  professional gamblers

[01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:54.840]  Yeah, you know, it's like
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:54:00.960]  You know, I first met him after the movie came out I said it is yeah
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:04.400]  I asked him that you give a name and it was it's
[01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:07.160]  He they were
[01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:08.960]  there he
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:14.520]  As a couple they were extraordinary people and he was an extraordinary person
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:17.080]  Yeah
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:18.640]  Yeah
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:20.640]  And a great breeder
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:24.240]  Let's let us let us not forget that
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:32.520]  Yeah, yeah, and then some have you seen great breeders? Have you seen bear by any chance? I haven't seen him
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:35.400]  I saw him yesterday. I was smoking a joint with him yesterday
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:39.920]  In fact, I got a little to tell him I said hello
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:42.720]  Yeah, I will
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:45.360]  Yeah, I see him a minimum once a week. I
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:50.920]  Actually helped him hook up with his girlfriend that he's with these days because he met her here
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.480]  Awesome
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:55:00.880]  Yeah, a lot of people meet there a lot of couples have been at your place. I was telling you about the extraordinary
[01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:03.760]  number of people that go
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:09.720]  Salma's place and this is another just another example
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:15.560]  Extraordinary number of relationships have come out of going to Selma's house for people. Yeah, there is
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:20.480]  No, not just really not just relationships and friendships
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:26.920]  but just even sometimes you meet a person just once never see them again and like
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:31.360]  They give you a piece of the jigsaw puzzle, you know
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.320]  Right that's happened there, right?
[01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:38.160]  Yeah happens all the time
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:42.200]  Yeah
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:46.400]  Yeah, I think that one of the last times I saw Barry it's been probably six or seven years as well
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:53.840]  He had gotten in a motorcycle accident. That was a long time ago. Yeah. Yeah motor scooter motor scooter. Yeah. Yeah
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:58.520]  Yeah
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:05.440]  Well, yeah, hopefully we can all go to Barcelona eventually I think this once this stuff is kind of resolved
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:09.760]  We'll do I'm assuming we'll be traveling in the next six months to a year
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:16.240]  And hopefully spina bistro happen next year again, you know, we'll skip two years and do one. I still got a booth
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:18.920]  I paid for a giant booth at spina bis to
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:25.440]  Exotic genetics was gonna be there. I was gonna be there dungeon vault and dark horse and Adam Adam done
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:30.320]  You guys both know Adam really? Well, yeah, so we had this super exotic. Yeah
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:38.400]  Yeah, yeah Mike he's doing really well his varieties his especially his breeding and his seeds he just did a release on
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:45.000]  Some rents crosses and I think you know, they're just crushed quality wise you think you think
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:49.660]  Jeff should call them, you know the advertised or advertising guy
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:52.280]  Sure
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:54.000]  Probably yeah
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  I'll have to get some names from you. Yeah, Ed's got a new book coming out and he's getting trying to get advertisements
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:03.160]  advertisement placement in the
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:10.800]  Specifically in the breeder section. Okay, so he's looking for breeders. We got a lot of breeders tuning into the show
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:14.240]  So, how do they contact you Ed if they're interested in that?
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:17.560]  Well
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:21.840]  Let me give you Jeff's number. They should call they called fast
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:28.080]  Second here also Ed on Instagram you can find Ed on Instagram it
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:30.680]  Ed Rosenthal 420
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:32.120]  Yeah, and
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:37.940]  Soma is Soma mission, which we really got to talk to we can end on some omission
[01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:44.220]  There's a lot I wanted to cover with Soma and the Soma mission like it's more than just so a mission being your house
[01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:46.120]  But your mission in life
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:49.280]  And your in your legacy, okay, and what's the number ready?
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:51.720]  three two three
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:56.800]  four two zero eight five zero nine and
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:00.040]  Jeff will be will answer and
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:04.280]  Just speak directly with him and he'll tell you all about it
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:09.480]  But it but I'll tell you about the book. It's a brand brand new
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:14.400]  edition of marijuana growers handbook, but it's
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:18.080]  now titled cannabis growers handbook and
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:20.640]  it is
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:23.360]  much expanded we've worked with
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:26.200]  Scientists researchers
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:33.040]  And also people in the industry people
[01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:36.640]  in lighting industry all kinds of
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:39.520]  Things we've done
[01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:41.520]  specific
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:44.040]  research for this book for instance
[01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:50.640]  We have a
[01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:52.760]  We have a
[01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:58.200]  Section on the evolution of a bud in other words we tested
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:04.040]  We tested flowers as they grew over a nine-week period
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:10.040]  As to what was happening chemically chemically and then we did some other
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:17.880]  We did a specific number of tests on how to get rid of smoke from your belt from your blood
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:19.960]  Hey, Ed. Yes, so
[01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:26.600]  Let's save this for a whole episode and we'll get you on in a couple weeks. Anyway, it's gonna be a fantastic book
[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:29.080]  It's just so different than anything. That's
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:31.880]  That that is out now
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:35.000]  Awesome. Yeah, let me leave it at that
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:39.260]  So so my mission and I want to talk about the Soma mission. Okay?
[01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:44.960]  well, well, you know don't mission you can find me on Instagram there under that name and
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:47.320]  and
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:50.120]  my website so ma seeds that you
[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:56.960]  can check out all my different genetics and stuff there and a lot of different information about
[01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:00.160]  cannabis and
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:10.360]  Some emission this like I'm registered here in this place as this Soma mission of sacred plants
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:13.600]  it's like a foundation and
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:16.240]  that foundation is
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:18.240]  to
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:20.000]  preserve
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.680]  sacred plants from being lost
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:26.560]  Sacred genetics from being lost and
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:29.440]  even in my
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:33.920]  Lifetime of 71 years. I've seen a lot of genetics get lost
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:40.360]  Like Southeast Asian strains I used to have access to I don't have those now and
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:45.520]  My friends that go to those places they can't find those strains there now
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:49.660]  I'm sure they're still there, but they can't find them
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:58.600]  Yeah, I had Cambodia I had Cambodia and late in Laotian weed back in in the 80s
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  That was phenomenal
[02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:05.120]  And I used to get some female seeds out of those buds, too
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:09.820]  I still have seeds that you gave me from Cambodia as they're still in my collection
[02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:14.740]  It was one of my favorite strains was Cambodian. It was so strong
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:17.680]  And so tasty
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:22.760]  Yeah, so let's talk about different different regions of the world too, you know
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:30.080]  I think cannabis from around the world that they all have different expressions and what what favorite Cambodia you think Soma?
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:39.280]  If I had to say what we I smoke that had the most psychedelic effect on me would be Southeast Asian weed
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:43.200]  Yeah, I like you many times
[02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:46.320]  since the 70s
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:53.120]  Yeah, yeah first time I got it was 72 and everything like from Thai to
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:56.760]  Cambodian
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:02.920]  Like Thai was mostly in a stick it was tied to a stick but sometime I get loose Thai
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:09.280]  But when I get Cambodian Laotian, it was just loose buzz. It was was not a stick or anything and it was just
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:13.960]  It has such a good shelf life to the way they cured it. They were so good at it
[02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:21.240]  It was so good every part of it and in the perfect climate to grow that kind of cannabis
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:27.360]  Yeah, and this is before we use technology with all the stuff that you know, they had perfected their growing
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:32.360]  Yeah, but even with technology now those strains take so long to flower
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:38.880]  That they would have to be really expensive to make it worth doing in a big grow place
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:41.640]  Yeah, it could be worth it. But
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:46.000]  You could grow like at least two other crops in the same period of time
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:53.280]  Well, and I think one thing, you know with science we can actually breed for certain straights traits that we like
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:57.560]  We can take those certain traits breed breed them into shorter flowering varieties
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:02.360]  Yeah, that's what I've been doing the whole time ever since I I grew some of those in Florida
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:09.920]  Like pure Southeast Asian strains and they would like I swear it was 22 feet tall the one I grew
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:15.480]  This one time 22 feet tall I couldn't how tall it was, you know
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:17.960]  Yeah
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:19.960]  Pretty amazing. It's a big plant
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:22.480]  Six. Okay. It was like a tree
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:28.920]  Well, they just keep getting bigger and flower to a lot of people don't understand those sativa varieties. Don't stop getting taller in flower
[02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:30.440]  They just keep getting bigger
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:37.300]  Sometimes tripling or quadrupling their size from when you flip the lights and I had these pure Afghanis growing next to it
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:39.080]  that were like
[02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:43.600]  two and a half three feet high as high as they would get and
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:49.240]  The Southeast Asian plants her Mac for diet a little bit and they got the Afghanis
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:54.800]  Fertilized and they made these Afghanis Southeast Asian seeds
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:02.800]  And that was some of the best weed I ever crew those seeds. It was so good that hybrid vigor. It was amazing
[02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:09.790]  So with your legacy and I'll ask you this at after we talked to some about it
[02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:13.230]  But let's talk about legacy for a minute and what you guys are leaving behind
[02:04:15.150 --> 02:04:21.390]  You know with family I know some of you have family you have a granddaughter who will hopefully be I got three grandchildren
[02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:23.870]  Three great. Yeah, totally
[02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:25.870]  Yep, so Lexus
[02:04:26.670 --> 02:04:28.390]  Sativa and
[02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:31.590]  Zion yeah, they're all getting really big
[02:04:32.190 --> 02:04:34.190]  Yeah, it's amazing
[02:04:34.630 --> 02:04:39.750]  Even my son. He's about to be eight next month in April April 70s eight. I
[02:04:40.670 --> 02:04:42.310]  Can't believe it
[02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:46.030]  You know it goes fast man. Yeah time just flies
[02:04:46.670 --> 02:04:51.410]  So legacy, you know, I think seeds and genetics is a big part of your legacy
[02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:54.110]  So
[02:04:54.110 --> 02:04:57.870]  Yes for sure. I mean like there's nothing like seeds
[02:04:58.550 --> 02:05:00.470]  seeds
[02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:04.030]  Seeds are real treasure. Yeah, they're real
[02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:08.430]  Useful treasure because even if you can't sell them
[02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:11.350]  Or give them away you can always grow
[02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:19.950]  Right. It's a commodity in one regard and then you know something they can be harvested into food and
[02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:22.230]  No medicine
[02:05:22.230 --> 02:05:26.150]  And when you and when you keep them in good condition, they have a pretty good shelf life
[02:05:26.350 --> 02:05:31.750]  Yeah, yeah, they sure do I think a lot of people don't don't store them correctly and they have issues with it
[02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:34.310]  But the better you store them the longer they will survive
[02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:39.310]  You know we were talking about I was reading the other day about 1200 year old seeds that have been germinated
[02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:43.590]  So possible it all depends on moisture I think
[02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:51.030]  Yeah moisture and dryness that you know that those levels and like also like insects and all that stuff
[02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:53.030]  but I I mean, I think that
[02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:55.270]  Nice
[02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:58.150]  Yep, so
[02:05:58.150 --> 02:06:05.550]  Ed yes about legacy with you. I mean your legacy is your books your children you have you have children as well
[02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:09.270]  Well
[02:06:09.270 --> 02:06:11.270]  I
[02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:12.790]  think that
[02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:14.790]  primarily
[02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:17.910]  My goal
[02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:19.910]  is not to
[02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:21.550]  My goal
[02:06:21.550 --> 02:06:25.430]  Has not yet been accomplished and that is
[02:06:26.110 --> 02:06:29.230]  To use marijuana as an agent of change
[02:06:29.870 --> 02:06:31.870]  to open up
[02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:39.630]  people sets and set perceptions and maybe for the first time in human history stop war and
[02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:42.550]  That's my ultimate goal
[02:06:43.470 --> 02:06:51.150]  Great I don't I don't think that that has been achieved and that's part of my million seed giveaway
[02:06:53.350 --> 02:06:58.590]  Yeah, it's get more people get more people see it, you know
[02:07:00.190 --> 02:07:03.470]  When we're perhaps even before we're born
[02:07:04.110 --> 02:07:06.110]  We are programmed
[02:07:06.590 --> 02:07:08.590]  by society
[02:07:09.110 --> 02:07:14.910]  Through parents and then by society as a whole with certain sets and set perceptions
[02:07:14.910 --> 02:07:19.190]  and we view life through those sets and set perceptions and
[02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:27.230]  And so it's like being in a little box and like I think that
[02:07:28.830 --> 02:07:35.710]  Cannabis and other psychedelics change people's what they do is a they
[02:07:36.710 --> 02:07:39.950]  Make the brain less efficient at
[02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:43.030]  filtering out
[02:07:43.030 --> 02:07:45.030]  random thoughts, so
[02:07:45.670 --> 02:07:51.910]  When you're if those random thoughts aren't filtered out you can look at life
[02:07:52.710 --> 02:07:54.070]  or
[02:07:54.070 --> 02:07:56.070]  anything from
[02:07:56.070 --> 02:07:58.070]  different perspectives than the
[02:07:59.270 --> 02:08:03.830]  If you were just in the box and I want to help people I
[02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:09.790]  Want to help open up that box so that people can have a fuller
[02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:16.390]  That they that they can that they can use
[02:08:18.150 --> 02:08:23.550]  Use their brain to a fuller extent open it up to more ideas
[02:08:26.030 --> 02:08:27.550]  Awesome
[02:08:27.550 --> 02:08:29.550]  That's my goal
