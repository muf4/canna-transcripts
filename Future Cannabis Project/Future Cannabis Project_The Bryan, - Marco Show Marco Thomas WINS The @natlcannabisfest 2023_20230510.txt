[00:26.360 --> 00:32.360]  What is up guys happy Wednesday to you. Obviously we have a very very special
[00:32.360 --> 00:36.720]  show today. So special in fact that it actually took two weeks to kind of
[00:36.720 --> 00:40.440]  behind the scenes get all the planning down. Hopefully everything comes through.
[00:40.440 --> 00:45.120]  We have a few people that we're going to interview but our very own Marco is
[00:45.120 --> 00:50.900]  honestly man making a name for himself which I think the community realizes
[00:50.900 --> 00:55.440]  that eventually that was going to happen for him. Grinding putting in the work. I
[00:55.440 --> 00:59.220]  was talking to him right before we came on here in my opinion. He's also one of
[00:59.220 --> 01:03.260]  those individuals that is constantly giving. I think there's something to life
[01:03.260 --> 01:07.140]  being a human being when you're constantly giving that things happen for
[01:07.140 --> 01:11.160]  you for whatever reason. You put in the work you know there's no there's no
[01:11.160 --> 01:15.120]  substitute for putting in the work but I think sometimes extra things happen to
[01:15.120 --> 01:19.180]  you when you're when you're constantly giving out. And you know a lot of
[01:19.180 --> 01:23.060]  individuals now are charging to try to understand how to grow cannabis or
[01:23.080 --> 01:26.520]  claiming that they're this elite grower farmer they've done these things.
[01:26.520 --> 01:29.960]  Unfortunately there's no fact-checking with a lot of that stuff so people get
[01:29.960 --> 01:35.000]  away with those kind of things. Marco's constantly giving this education for
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.580]  free because I think he realizes that a lot of individuals feel slided in a way
[01:40.580 --> 01:45.680]  jaded in a way. There's so many different ways to farm cannabis if you don't
[01:45.680 --> 01:49.920]  understand A to Z for certain things or maybe you've been misled with certain
[01:49.980 --> 01:54.940]  things. It's hard to farm cannabis at the elite level so today I want to bring
[01:54.940 --> 02:01.260]  Marco on. He's behind the scenes right there with somebody that is obviously
[02:01.260 --> 02:08.460]  just kind of taking it to the next level man. Are you able to? I'm here brother.
[02:08.460 --> 02:13.300]  I don't know if we can see. We're gonna bring me on here in a second. I'm gonna
[02:13.300 --> 02:17.220]  just right now I want everybody look at this divine pine. Okay all right yeah
[02:17.220 --> 02:22.160]  let's talk about that. Yeah man like you know like we talk about it every show
[02:22.160 --> 02:27.000]  man we're always talking about that microbial diversity that live in soil.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.760]  I'm preaching it every week and basically when I'm growing a plant man I
[02:31.760 --> 02:35.440]  just want to grow that plant to its maximum potential. You know a picture is
[02:35.440 --> 02:38.720]  one thing you know what I mean a picture doesn't really tell the whole story you
[02:38.720 --> 02:43.880]  know what I mean. So you know growing it out doing the things we say man and
[02:44.220 --> 02:49.380]  really focusing on that microbial diversity in our soil you know those are
[02:49.380 --> 02:55.020]  the things that you know that when you put those things together and you
[02:55.020 --> 02:59.500]  get a good plant with good genetics you know you could be blessed and
[02:59.500 --> 03:04.100]  take home a first-place trophy. You know what I mean belts you know what I mean. I'm
[03:04.100 --> 03:08.720]  blessed I'm humbled I'm thankful that you know people were able to you know to
[03:08.720 --> 03:13.460]  smoke my cannabis and love it to the point where they you know at this
[03:13.520 --> 03:18.160]  competition you know they label me as grand champion you know they love this
[03:18.160 --> 03:21.880]  this plant that we're looking at the most you know what I mean. And you know
[03:21.880 --> 03:27.800]  listen all the stuff we talk about you know what I mean that's what I do. Natural
[03:27.800 --> 03:32.560]  farming y'all know what I do I do Jadam I do natural farming I put my own mix on
[03:32.560 --> 03:39.840]  it I look at K&F every every discipline. Matt Powers new book is key love that
[03:39.940 --> 03:46.940]  book by the way. But just and welcome I see Kat popped up so just like nothing
[03:46.940 --> 03:52.980]  has changed you know what these belts do though for me is they validate that what
[03:52.980 --> 03:58.020]  we're saying does work that natural farming is the key to get the most out
[03:58.020 --> 04:03.300]  of your plant and to get you know kind of the most plant expression. So I want
[04:03.300 --> 04:09.340]  to thank NCC thank you Kat and it was a it was a it was a wild process you know
[04:09.340 --> 04:15.400]  with we have weather delays and all kinds of stuff but ultimately they were
[04:15.400 --> 04:18.560]  able to give out the awards and I'm just you know I'm really thankful and blessed
[04:18.560 --> 04:21.940]  and this one is like for like I said man for the natural farmers you know what I
[04:21.940 --> 04:27.560]  mean this is for it's for us man like bottle guys do your thing you know but
[04:27.560 --> 04:32.320]  I'm here to show you you can spend very little money very little cost focus on a
[04:32.320 --> 04:38.640]  good quality light focus on your soil and you know good genetics man and and
[04:38.900 --> 04:43.860]  thankfully I was able to take home that W so with that said I see Kat has joined
[04:43.860 --> 04:47.780]  us and she's with the NCC National Cannabis Championships I want to welcome
[04:47.780 --> 04:52.680]  your board Kat and maybe you can say hey and just kind of tell tell the folks a
[04:52.680 --> 04:57.100]  little bit about yourself you know what you do and everything like that. I
[04:57.100 --> 05:02.940]  appreciate it I apologize I don't have any headphones so if there's an echo I
[05:02.940 --> 05:08.340]  let me know I apologize about that guys but appreciate the opportunity to
[05:08.340 --> 05:14.160]  hop on the show and congratulations Marco you know it was a really awesome
[05:14.160 --> 05:19.200]  competition you know being able to see everything from the back end and stuff
[05:19.200 --> 05:25.480]  and seeing all the test results all the scorecards you know there were some
[05:25.480 --> 05:31.720]  obvious standouts yourself and then one of the other competitors so you know to
[05:31.720 --> 05:35.840]  your point I'm actually both you guys use very similar methods it's also a
[05:35.840 --> 05:43.020]  living soil kind of guy so you know it's it's really great speaking to you
[05:43.020 --> 05:49.100]  what you're just talking about for natural farmers and industry you know
[05:49.100 --> 05:54.020]  being able to do that in different environments different places you know
[05:54.020 --> 05:56.940]  the education that you guys are able to provide and support that community I
[05:56.940 --> 06:03.200]  think is valuable and to your point you know it shows up in the winner circle so
[06:03.220 --> 06:11.060]  yeah thank you very much for you know competing this year and you know like
[06:11.060 --> 06:16.940]  you said we wish we could have you know had you guys on stage but we're stoked
[06:16.940 --> 06:21.920]  to hopefully still have that moment for you all definitely deserve it and we
[06:21.920 --> 06:24.540]  definitely didn't want to wait any further to give you guys here
[06:24.540 --> 06:32.180]  yeah so thank you well I just why we have you here I know I know your time is
[06:32.280 --> 06:36.000]  short I just wanted to from to hear from you guys like how did you judge
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.320]  everything because obviously we feel a certain way about how to form cannabis
[06:40.320 --> 06:43.760]  but you just mentioned obviously the other individual that did the monkey
[06:43.760 --> 06:48.680]  berries shout out to tricode preservation society that individual is
[06:48.680 --> 06:54.040]  also up there with Marco with the belts so I wanted to know how your judges you
[06:54.040 --> 06:58.240]  know kind of went through those things because obviously we love to see when
[06:58.240 --> 07:02.040]  living soil is shining through and this is a for those that don't know this is a
[07:02.060 --> 07:06.620]  major event I was able to go last year hang out with Marco you know there's
[07:06.620 --> 07:13.300]  what was it to change this year juicy J I mean some some bigger name artists and
[07:13.300 --> 07:17.420]  stuff at this so it's a festival not just like a cannabis thing so it's
[07:17.420 --> 07:22.900]  humbling to see and I am so proud of Marco to be able to bring home a W like
[07:22.900 --> 07:28.140]  that for the small-time individual the small-time farmer the individuals like
[07:28.140 --> 07:33.240]  Marco man I mean this is proof that you don't necessarily have to have suit type
[07:33.240 --> 07:37.760]  stuff to farm high-end cannabis and Marco's been preaching this for almost
[07:37.760 --> 07:42.600]  two years now so again buddy like today's your your day man I love seeing
[07:42.600 --> 07:46.360]  you I hope that you don't change that posture all I'll show because the double
[07:46.360 --> 07:53.680]  champ is something cool to see but yeah definitely yeah you know it's it's the
[07:53.680 --> 07:58.080]  festival itself so the National Cannabis Festival so they located here in DC
[07:58.500 --> 08:03.500]  but we really we bring people from all over there all over the world and United
[08:03.500 --> 08:08.380]  States who come to the actual festival that's our seven it was our seventh year
[08:08.380 --> 08:13.380]  holding the actual festival and yeah each year to your point it gets bigger
[08:13.380 --> 08:19.260]  and bigger this year is our second year holding the competition so that's called
[08:19.260 --> 08:26.540]  the National Cannabis Championship and what we did last year is we contacted we
[08:26.540 --> 08:31.160]  have some folks you know with other cups and we'll cup and things like that
[08:31.160 --> 08:36.080]  trying to just kind of look at all the different things that people are judging
[08:36.080 --> 08:39.480]  how they're judging there's also competitions out there that are
[08:39.480 --> 08:46.080]  strictly you know no judging is involved right as well so you know we have
[08:46.080 --> 08:51.740]  thankfully at our fingertips now in the area and DMV great labs to be able to
[08:51.740 --> 08:57.800]  lean on that have great standardized analysis it can provide cannabinoid
[08:57.800 --> 09:03.960]  profiles as well as terpenoid profiles so we kind of looked at also you know
[09:03.960 --> 09:09.160]  what's our history and culture about you know also genetics names you know like
[09:09.160 --> 09:13.120]  you've mentioned Marco great breeding things like that so we try to kind of
[09:13.120 --> 09:20.660]  pick all those things for and also make the process as blind as possible so most
[09:20.660 --> 09:27.080]  people as you know or most competitions have a judging process and the criteria
[09:27.080 --> 09:33.080]  similar to you know whenever you're first consuming anything aroma flavor
[09:33.080 --> 09:39.640]  just overall aesthetics those things obviously also the consumption as well
[09:39.640 --> 09:44.720]  and so we've broken that into the judging process itself is three
[09:44.720 --> 09:50.480]  different stages so we have and there's an then there's two different rounds
[09:50.500 --> 09:57.460]  so each round is exactly the same but the actual judging process the judges
[09:57.460 --> 10:03.820]  get their kits they first have the actual physical samples themselves and
[10:03.820 --> 10:11.020]  that scorecard includes the judging like I just mentioned aroma taste the
[10:11.020 --> 10:16.160]  experience aesthetics things like that there's a point specific for each of
[10:16.160 --> 10:20.600]  those categories and so we asked the judges to go through all of the samples
[10:20.600 --> 10:25.240]  that we provide them you know depending on what round they're judging there have
[10:25.240 --> 10:33.160]  different samples and then we have them try to do that completely you know all
[10:33.160 --> 10:38.680]  the samples up together in that stage basically you know spread out amongst
[10:38.680 --> 10:43.120]  however much time they'd like to consume them but that first stage is really just
[10:43.120 --> 10:47.560]  about the old-school you know effects and what you know does it taste good to
[10:47.560 --> 10:54.480]  you what's going on there the second stage so we kind of call the you know
[10:54.480 --> 11:01.080]  the lab analysis part and this is strictly just it's another blind so
[11:01.080 --> 11:04.800]  samples in the first have random associated numbers with them there's
[11:04.800 --> 11:08.360]  nothing else that's associated with them they just get random numbers so they
[11:08.360 --> 11:13.080]  don't get any genetics they don't get any profiles or anything like that just
[11:13.080 --> 11:18.040]  the physical samples so the second part they just get very similarly just the
[11:18.040 --> 11:23.760]  cannabinoid profiles and just the terpenoid profiles these are also
[11:23.760 --> 11:30.560]  completely blind so I'm literally you know a number generator picking these
[11:30.560 --> 11:35.480]  numbers blind and then they're associated with that so as a judge you
[11:35.480 --> 11:41.560]  get a packet with you know however many of these profiles we have a scorecard
[11:41.560 --> 11:46.160]  it's just about what you know you know and what what you are as an individual
[11:46.160 --> 11:49.160]  and what's unique to you what do you think stands out for you that you look
[11:49.160 --> 11:54.680]  at when you go and are consuming something and that's all you have you
[11:54.680 --> 11:59.560]  know a lot of states now you can as a consumer both in recreational markets
[11:59.560 --> 12:04.960]  and medical markets have that information available to you so a lot of
[12:04.960 --> 12:09.760]  times most people you know know what those terpene profiles really work well
[12:09.760 --> 12:13.800]  for them or what they're you know kind of seeking as far as a cannabinoid
[12:13.800 --> 12:18.560]  profile as well so that's another stage we ask the same thing go through all
[12:18.560 --> 12:22.680]  those profiles together they're all blind no one knows what they which they
[12:22.680 --> 12:28.640]  go to and set that aside after that the last one is what I think is pretty fun
[12:28.640 --> 12:34.320]  as well it's kind of the the you know you know what is what was I consuming
[12:34.320 --> 12:40.000]  possibly and so this is just a straight list of the names and the genetics they
[12:40.000 --> 12:46.280]  don't actually get to you know any cross-referencing of what they were
[12:46.280 --> 12:51.920]  consuming with the previous two stages but most judges can usually line up for
[12:51.920 --> 12:57.240]  most of the samples if they have a well you know background in genetics and
[12:57.240 --> 13:02.000]  things like that so that last stage is really cool personally because we kind
[13:02.000 --> 13:08.520]  of give homage to the culture you know I can't this names are unique they come
[13:08.520 --> 13:13.080]  in all different shapes and sizes just like the flower itself as well as
[13:13.080 --> 13:17.880]  genetics behind them so the judges go through that last stage that's the third
[13:17.880 --> 13:21.920]  stage they give points in the scorecard specifically that and then all three of
[13:21.920 --> 13:27.080]  those scorecards are given back to us and then that's where we do our work in
[13:27.080 --> 13:31.960]  the back end of calculating the entire score from all three stages for each
[13:31.960 --> 13:37.520]  competitor so we try to make the process as blind as possible and also
[13:37.520 --> 13:42.640]  incorporate everything that we can think of that you know from the very beginning
[13:42.640 --> 13:47.480]  we've been judging cannabis with right like I remember used to going into the
[13:47.480 --> 13:51.440]  dispensary and you know what's blue dream well you know super silver haze and
[13:51.440 --> 13:59.160]  blueberry you know and that's all you had so you might be able to smell it but
[13:59.160 --> 14:04.400]  you know having those kind of understandings and those backgrounds and
[14:04.400 --> 14:07.960]  all the United States it's just completely different some people some
[14:07.960 --> 14:12.680]  people that's all they have still so yeah we're just trying to do the best we
[14:12.680 --> 14:18.600]  can to kind of touch all the bases and create a judging process that is also
[14:18.600 --> 14:24.480]  blind yeah that was articulated very well usually people are like oh we just
[14:24.480 --> 14:29.280]  put some weed in some jars we gave it to some people we said you know used one
[14:29.280 --> 14:32.800]  through ten people were doing one through five there's just a lot of
[14:32.800 --> 14:37.720]  behind-the-scenes kind of bullshit so it's interesting to me that two
[14:37.720 --> 14:42.360]  individuals that sounds like they're heavily focused on the microbial world
[14:42.360 --> 14:46.600]  were able to to rise and shine through that and that's what we'd like to see
[14:46.600 --> 14:50.320]  with a few other things before we came on here there's another gentleman
[14:50.320 --> 14:53.960]  genome alchemy which is another gentleman I think that now Marco kind of
[14:53.960 --> 15:00.760]  has that same kind of I hope homegrown clout or you know somebody that is is
[15:00.760 --> 15:05.880]  self-funded self promoted I mean he has an Instagram account that's on fire here
[15:05.880 --> 15:09.680]  at Kat I mean he's just he understands branding he understands a lot of the
[15:09.680 --> 15:13.120]  stuff that I think a lot of more more individuals that want to get deeper into
[15:13.360 --> 15:16.800]  farming cannabis especially I'm more maybe more of on a commercial scale
[15:16.800 --> 15:21.480]  don't realize that you need all of that kind of octopus type style where not
[15:21.480 --> 15:24.760]  only do you need that good flower but people need to know about it it's kind
[15:24.760 --> 15:29.840]  of the point of these competitions this was a major major competition as far as
[15:29.840 --> 15:34.520]  people that I've you know going around seeing a bunch of different of these
[15:34.520 --> 15:39.680]  around the country that one was fun man and last year Marco and I sat in I don't
[15:39.680 --> 15:42.400]  know if you're also in charge of some of the educational things but we sat down
[15:42.560 --> 15:49.200]  and we're listening to a lot of people talk especially even the the lady her
[15:49.200 --> 15:52.880]  name escapes me but she was from Emerald Cup she's kind of under explaining a lot
[15:52.880 --> 15:55.600]  of different things Marco and I right there in like the
[15:55.600 --> 16:00.400]  second or third row taking notes so Marco lives and breathes this stuff and
[16:00.400 --> 16:05.560]  it was great to see that you know one of the good guys in our world finally
[16:05.560 --> 16:09.480]  brought it brought it home for we call them receipts I guess where I'm from
[16:09.480 --> 16:13.040]  where it's actually like it's it's something great to see and it's proof
[16:13.040 --> 16:17.400]  that Marco's out there living and breathing what he's talking about each
[16:17.400 --> 16:22.600]  week yeah it was um and overall you know it was it was a great event the
[16:22.600 --> 16:25.640]  experience was great the only problem we had and I'll just kind of talk you out
[16:25.640 --> 16:30.600]  through how it went it was just the weather like the day of the event it was
[16:30.600 --> 16:34.760]  like I hit just heading there it was all good then all sudden the bottom just
[16:34.760 --> 16:40.240]  fell out and I think obviously that delayed it and then we pushed it later
[16:40.240 --> 16:44.120]  the concert started later and then it was just it was just a mess with the
[16:44.120 --> 16:48.680]  weather and it was the no one's fault like it was just that's how it happened
[16:48.680 --> 16:52.600]  and so I and they had the dilemma you know be announced it how do you announce
[16:52.600 --> 16:57.200]  it and then and then it was like well we'll wait until another concert and
[16:57.200 --> 17:00.400]  kind of announce it and then as a grower you're like damn I gotta wait even
[17:00.400 --> 17:06.000]  longer now you know so and then luckily like a week after that y'all came back
[17:06.000 --> 17:10.400]  and said hey come on up here you know we got something for you and I'm still I
[17:10.400 --> 17:13.680]  didn't know you know what I want you know I knew that you know there's a lot
[17:13.680 --> 17:17.440]  of prizes and I know so you know I'm sure a lot of people have to come up to
[17:17.440 --> 17:21.640]  the office and pick up stuff so I still didn't know until you know like really
[17:21.640 --> 17:27.680]  the very end when I saw you bring in the bag of belts I was like okay hopefully
[17:27.680 --> 17:33.200]  this is one for me and in this bag and you know so the rest is history so other
[17:33.200 --> 17:38.200]  than the weather man you know you guys I think the it worked out fine you know
[17:38.200 --> 17:43.280]  like we said we've been over cups and things that didn't go well and I think
[17:43.280 --> 17:48.760]  all that starts kind of with the rules you guys even did better with the rules
[17:48.760 --> 17:52.520]  this year you added to them you kind of added some new categories and I'm sure
[17:52.520 --> 17:56.160]  that was a direct feedback from other growers like wanting to know well what
[17:56.160 --> 18:00.760]  about THC what about turps which are two of the things that we you know are
[18:00.760 --> 18:05.760]  very you know most important so just you know a much respect to you all for a
[18:05.760 --> 18:11.520]  proper event and like Brian said we were there last year and um you know I
[18:11.520 --> 18:17.560]  entered and got the top ten and that was cool and I just said you know what I
[18:17.560 --> 18:23.600]  like this event I'm coming back so we came back I went to the lab kind of got
[18:23.600 --> 18:28.000]  my pop some seeds you know I mean last year I went with a clone cut I never I
[18:28.000 --> 18:33.080]  would never recommend that doing that I did that only because at the time you
[18:33.080 --> 18:36.200]  know how it is when you're growing out certain plants going doing certain
[18:36.200 --> 18:41.160]  things trying certain things out and I got the free entry so my timing was hey
[18:41.160 --> 18:45.920]  this is what I'm entering and it was what it was but that's just the way it
[18:45.920 --> 18:49.720]  went I said you know what this is I like this competition so I want to get get in
[18:49.720 --> 18:55.480]  it and uh and when he had that big red belt last year the kushory shout out to
[18:55.480 --> 19:02.160]  them for being the first grand champ I just saw I said man I would like to have
[19:02.160 --> 19:06.900]  one as well if I could get one and thankfully you know with some proper
[19:06.900 --> 19:13.720]  genetics like I said I mean the things went my way so very very grateful and I
[19:13.720 --> 19:17.320]  recommend anybody joining this countless you know cup you know looking forward
[19:17.320 --> 19:23.200]  because just the way it was done I felt like it was the right way yeah thank you
[19:23.200 --> 19:27.760]  so much we're looking at for you know Maryland coming online next year so
[19:27.760 --> 19:34.720]  we'll finally have you know DMV so you know we just like when you know
[19:34.720 --> 19:40.440]  Virginia kind of came online everyone knows that it's not like Maryland is or
[19:40.440 --> 19:46.680]  Virginians or DC anyone has really been waiting for the law to change so you
[19:46.680 --> 19:50.600]  know and we know there's a lot of great growers in Maryland that have been you
[19:50.600 --> 19:55.800]  know waiting on edge of their seats to be able to compete I'm very stoked to be
[19:55.800 --> 20:01.560]  able to have Maryland be a part of it next year and you know yeah I think both
[20:01.560 --> 20:05.280]  years you know it's Virginians have really stepped it up it's really been
[20:05.280 --> 20:11.200]  awesome to see just the diversity and how people are growing you know and
[20:11.200 --> 20:17.200]  what's been you know to your point like genetics people are kind of popping and
[20:17.200 --> 20:23.640]  in the area and how that's really plays a really big part I think from what I've
[20:23.640 --> 20:29.440]  seen to your point I think the genetics kind of you know is that usually the
[20:29.440 --> 20:34.200]  missing piece of the puzzle if you can get dialed into wherever you're at you
[20:34.200 --> 20:38.760]  know that that f1 is definitely has a lot of vigor so that's pretty cool I
[20:38.760 --> 20:43.520]  didn't realize that you popped seeds for this one so that's pretty sweet but
[20:43.520 --> 20:51.440]  yeah we also really wish you know as far as the festival it was really
[20:51.440 --> 20:56.040]  unfortunate we definitely you know crushed that it's a go out the way we
[20:56.040 --> 21:00.800]  planned but and you know we have had years past with weather but this year
[21:00.800 --> 21:05.320]  was we just happen to be under that pocket that was pretty severe so we
[21:05.320 --> 21:09.080]  appreciate your understanding you know like you said we definitely did as much
[21:09.080 --> 21:16.560]  as we could under the city's watch and after you know they allowed us to reopen
[21:16.560 --> 21:20.480]  and things like that you know we definitely wanted to make sure that
[21:20.480 --> 21:27.120]  things that were missed like the awards also can a tank and education and things
[21:27.120 --> 21:31.720]  like that we are planning on doing another event and making sure that you
[21:31.720 --> 21:37.000]  know education is huge for us as well so having you guys come out I think it'll
[21:37.000 --> 21:40.120]  be great because everyone will know the winners and be able to pick your brains
[21:40.120 --> 21:45.360]  even more that day and in general as a grower you know we don't want to hold
[21:45.360 --> 21:49.280]  back those prizes you know there's going to be great additions to the garden so
[21:49.280 --> 21:55.080]  that's only gonna be able to help you compete next year of course oh yeah
[21:55.080 --> 22:01.120]  definitely so just a little story on how I got to you know the the by pine the
[22:01.120 --> 22:07.240]  one that I grew so I grew the one I entered last year was white truffle by
[22:07.240 --> 22:12.080]  it was from belief one of my friends with good breeder excellent breeder
[22:12.080 --> 22:18.360]  belief so I love the white truffle look it was wonderful but I said damn I need
[22:18.360 --> 22:23.320]  more turps you know what I mean so I ended up getting a gift pack from him
[22:23.320 --> 22:29.080]  which was where he took white truffle and crossed it with divinity 35 in-house
[22:29.080 --> 22:36.120]  genetics strain and then he he had divine truffle seed so I thought those
[22:36.120 --> 22:39.960]  are the ones I pop and then I started looking through those and you know
[22:39.960 --> 22:43.840]  wanting that I want something more turpentine that one divine pine head I
[22:43.840 --> 22:50.120]  was like man just that pine was so so strong in her you know I mean and still
[22:50.120 --> 22:53.640]  kept the look I was like I feel like this is the one it was so strong too it
[22:53.640 --> 22:57.480]  was like just testing through him it was like you'd have to put it down after
[22:57.640 --> 23:01.240]  like half of J you know I mean or whatever like it's like half of whatever
[23:01.240 --> 23:05.200]  you normally do is like you're not going farther than that so it's very strong so
[23:05.200 --> 23:09.920]  I was like all right sounds good you know and ultimately just just gave it a
[23:09.920 --> 23:15.000]  shot but um I love it like and so I'm glad other people did too
[23:15.000 --> 23:19.720]  turps is key man like you gotta you know you gotta be able to like Brian says
[23:19.720 --> 23:23.800]  crap when you crack open a jar you know you kind of smell it across the room and
[23:23.800 --> 23:27.000]  those are the things that obviously the judges look for we got some very
[23:27.560 --> 23:31.840]  you know seasoned judges which is also key I think when you want to have a good
[23:31.840 --> 23:38.680]  cup so yeah yeah with this thing only being two years in it'd be cool cat if
[23:38.680 --> 23:42.200]  you'd like always had whoever the grant however you guys want to do it I'm not
[23:42.200 --> 23:45.280]  but it'd be cool to always have like judges come back and that kind of thing
[23:45.280 --> 23:50.080]  continue that because it kind of like a lineage in my opinion that's the that's
[23:50.080 --> 23:54.240]  the part that's missing from these cups is that there's something that people
[23:54.240 --> 23:58.320]  care about you know it used to matter about certain cups and now people could
[23:58.320 --> 24:03.520]  care less than they care more about how their peers feel Marco was saying that
[24:03.520 --> 24:07.640]  even the belts are well thought out quality that kind of stuff those little
[24:07.640 --> 24:11.760]  details matter I think especially to individuals that are putting their time
[24:11.760 --> 24:15.680]  and effort into a competition and I think people forget that so I just
[24:15.680 --> 24:19.080]  wanted to give credit where credit was due cat it seems like you you and I
[24:19.080 --> 24:22.680]  would imagine your team have thought through a lot of the smaller details
[24:22.680 --> 24:27.720]  and maybe the nuances that people have been probably vocal about and
[24:27.720 --> 24:32.560]  disappointed on it's it's cool to see where time and effort is put into
[24:32.560 --> 24:36.680]  something especially on this grand scale it seems like people from all over you
[24:36.680 --> 24:40.440]  had mentioned the world I didn't know that definitely around the country I saw
[24:40.440 --> 24:45.000]  we're making this as a destinational event and I hope that continues for you
[24:45.000 --> 24:51.040]  guys because it's well-deserved yeah thank you it's been it's been a you know
[24:51.040 --> 24:56.120]  we're always open to suggestions we got we had the new belts this year so just
[24:56.120 --> 25:00.200]  like you know with anything else in industry we're you know constantly
[25:00.200 --> 25:05.000]  looking to see what's new around the corner and other states that we could
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.960]  possibly add that are in the area that logistically could work and things like
[25:07.960 --> 25:15.200]  that too so and yeah we also we have a some community judges that we use or
[25:15.200 --> 25:17.680]  that we have a contest for and we're gonna I think we're gonna continue to do
[25:17.680 --> 25:21.080]  that year over year I think that's really important you know to have a
[25:21.080 --> 25:27.680]  diverse kind of crowd of folks but also you know some consistency as well so we
[25:27.680 --> 25:31.800]  do have some judges that we brought back this year as well and appreciate that
[25:31.800 --> 25:36.040]  feedback because you know it's yeah year over year being able to kind of have
[25:36.040 --> 25:43.960]  folks that are consistent enough have seen you know various years and the
[25:43.960 --> 25:49.200]  samples and things like that as well as you know fresh new new folks who want to
[25:49.200 --> 25:54.160]  want a chance to be able to be a part of the process and use their expertise you
[25:54.160 --> 25:58.480]  know we're always trying to kind of balance balance all those things and you
[25:58.480 --> 26:03.520]  know we're excited to you know have the same belts next year we're also looking
[26:03.520 --> 26:07.900]  at probably maybe some additions or working with some other competitions as
[26:07.900 --> 26:14.780]  well I know there's another competition where you're given the genetics and I
[26:14.780 --> 26:20.540]  know they finished up in MJ business biz con this past year gave out their
[26:20.540 --> 26:25.020]  awards during MJ biz con just leaving my head what the name of the competition is
[26:25.020 --> 26:30.260]  but that one's really cool because you're actually given I believe it's cut
[26:30.260 --> 26:35.460]  or clone I'm pretty sure it's rooted but are you talking about the grow off yes
[26:35.460 --> 26:39.140]  yeah there you go yeah so you're given no I think that was awesome right like
[26:39.140 --> 26:43.820]  you're given a genetic you don't even know what it is and so it's kind of like
[26:43.820 --> 26:50.860]  a blind you know race for race for the money so I think again you know we're
[26:50.860 --> 26:55.700]  always looking for suggestions and to improve the process as well as lean on
[26:55.700 --> 27:04.120]  some of the stuff that's worked before are you guys gonna um I know that one
[27:04.120 --> 27:09.880]  next year with Maryland is it something that you guys will expand or is it gonna
[27:09.880 --> 27:16.080]  be more regional as other states kind of come online to us in the DMV area yeah
[27:16.080 --> 27:21.400]  well I think you know it's funny because most of us all goes down in March so we
[27:21.400 --> 27:25.880]  I think of it as though my own March Madness you know that's happening most
[27:25.880 --> 27:30.360]  suggesting and the scrambling around stuff so and it is kind of like a
[27:30.360 --> 27:35.360]  tournament you know we do have the state rounds so basically you know the
[27:35.360 --> 27:39.240]  last two years everyone from the DMV or to me the district and then everyone
[27:39.240 --> 27:44.880]  from Virginia they had competed amongst themselves in that state round and then
[27:44.880 --> 27:50.400]  the top five from that rounds then went on to compete in the finals round so it
[27:50.400 --> 27:56.320]  is kind of like a tournament so I think which which are some other there's some
[27:56.320 --> 27:59.960]  other cups that have done that I know high times does that for their World Cup
[27:59.960 --> 28:04.760]  and things like that so or similar you have to qualify basically to get to get
[28:04.760 --> 28:08.920]  into the final championship so I think we're gonna you know do something like
[28:08.920 --> 28:14.880]  that obviously you know year over year we'd love to you know expand out we've
[28:14.880 --> 28:19.320]  decided to really focus for right now on home growers and you know individual
[28:19.320 --> 28:26.480]  growers in states that allow home growth so that's our kind of our thing right
[28:26.480 --> 28:30.040]  now that we're really trying to elevate folks like you who have been doing it
[28:30.040 --> 28:36.760]  really well and you know should have a competition to be able to compete and
[28:36.760 --> 28:42.560]  get their information out there how you guys are doing it and so yeah it's it's
[28:42.560 --> 28:48.680]  been great you know we're kind of looking at obviously the the there's
[28:48.680 --> 28:53.600]  some states up in Northeast that you know do you have more home grow but for
[28:53.600 --> 28:58.040]  right now the logistics we haven't figured those out yet so ideally it
[28:58.040 --> 29:01.760]  would be sweet to you know definitely add as many as we can and then have
[29:01.760 --> 29:09.600]  either regions and then like a third you know third tier or whatnot so yeah I
[29:09.600 --> 29:14.520]  like it cuz I mean we talked about this like someone we always say it Brian you
[29:14.520 --> 29:19.280]  know who's gonna step up and kind of spit you know you know be the be the
[29:19.280 --> 29:23.840]  national be the whatever it is kind of competition for us you know the home
[29:23.840 --> 29:28.960]  growers and where it's fair and you know everybody can kind of have a shot at it
[29:28.960 --> 29:35.640]  and so yeah I mean it was fun I was like you know it's like I told Brian it's
[29:35.640 --> 29:39.720]  like a year-long chess game you know I mean cuz once you start if you start if
[29:39.720 --> 29:43.880]  you're thinking about doing this now you should already be on it like popping
[29:43.880 --> 29:48.840]  seeds looking for things and so when you do it that way it makes it just like a
[29:48.920 --> 29:52.840]  year-long thing like I got a guy's chat that you know from my college buddies
[29:52.840 --> 29:57.120]  you know kind of chatting I just every now and I'll keep hitting them up with
[29:57.120 --> 30:02.880]  what I'm doing how the strains are doing not even it's like they do care but not
[30:02.880 --> 30:08.040]  to the extent that we do but I mean that's just how it is it became it was
[30:08.040 --> 30:11.960]  like my life like if you knew me you knew you know I'm working on something
[30:11.960 --> 30:15.440]  I'm doing something here trying to trying to you know create things and
[30:15.440 --> 30:18.840]  trying to find strain so most people that know me really well know that and
[30:18.840 --> 30:23.400]  so yeah it's nice to have a place to just go out there and see you know
[30:23.400 --> 30:28.080]  amongst your peers you know how you do win lose win or lose you know I mean you
[30:28.080 --> 30:32.600]  meet people you get better you learn things you say I'm go at it again next
[30:32.600 --> 30:37.560]  year you know what I mean and so yeah I mean I'm happy to know that um yeah that
[30:37.560 --> 30:41.720]  that other strain is also you know growing with natural methods and stuff
[30:41.720 --> 30:46.280]  man that makes me feel even better cuz now it's like yeah double time you know
[30:46.280 --> 30:51.720]  as far as natural farming and stuff so doubling up on them like so if you're
[30:51.720 --> 30:56.000]  still buying you know to me you know salts and things like that at this stage
[30:56.000 --> 31:03.400]  you know well keep on you know I mean your stuff won't be as good if you keep
[31:03.400 --> 31:08.440]  going you know doing it like that not saying it can't be but it's gonna cost
[31:08.440 --> 31:11.720]  you more I'll tell you that much you know you're gonna pay more than I'm
[31:11.720 --> 31:15.760]  paying you know it's gonna take you a long time to get that skill set you know
[31:15.760 --> 31:21.400]  when you're using the microbial world you have that buffer and now we have it
[31:21.400 --> 31:25.120]  man you're you've won the you won the trophy without any other outside
[31:25.120 --> 31:30.440]  influence I think that's something that's really fun to see you know when I
[31:30.440 --> 31:34.360]  was playing poker more for a living there's this dude his name comically was
[31:34.360 --> 31:38.000]  called Chris moneymaker and he went from this little small-time dude he got a
[31:38.040 --> 31:43.320]  free entry into it and he won the main event and I feel like in a kind of
[31:43.320 --> 31:46.480]  hopefully in a small way you see that this this is what I think is gonna
[31:46.480 --> 31:52.680]  happen for you buddy is that you kind of are carrying the torch for this style of
[31:52.680 --> 31:56.160]  farming and there's other individuals out there that are also doing that but
[31:56.160 --> 32:02.120]  now I feel like you're at that you got you got the credentials now so it's just
[32:02.120 --> 32:06.200]  great to see somebody that like you know when we first got out you know I reached
[32:06.320 --> 32:09.960]  out to you because there's something special about you man and it went in
[32:09.960 --> 32:14.520]  something like this I think is just I hope that it gives the community more
[32:14.520 --> 32:18.520]  confidence in themselves to be like all right I got a small-time grow I'm a tent
[32:18.520 --> 32:23.320]  farmer all I got is a basement okay but you're in control of that and complete I
[32:23.320 --> 32:27.440]  hope you stay in complete control of that partnerships and all that stuff
[32:27.440 --> 32:31.680]  that's it's hard it fades you know Marco's in control of his own destiny
[32:31.680 --> 32:35.160]  because he he doesn't partner up with anybody you know so I think there's
[32:35.160 --> 32:41.000]  something to that he's making his own IMOs there's a dramatic difference to
[32:41.000 --> 32:44.040]  that and I hope that the newer people that are gonna watch this because he's
[32:44.040 --> 32:47.560]  sitting here with his belts I hope that you guys go down the rabbit hole and see
[32:47.560 --> 32:52.280]  the farming with the microbial world using mother nature is a game-changer
[32:52.280 --> 32:55.680]  and if you're first starting to get into this the end goal is to create the high
[32:55.680 --> 32:59.320]  end turps for the concentrates that's what a majority of people want these
[32:59.320 --> 33:03.520]  days so if you're able to do that you know relatively soon within a year or
[33:03.520 --> 33:07.040]  two of you farming in this manner you're gonna be so far ahead of the game
[33:07.040 --> 33:11.800]  that you'll find success for yourself and hopefully you know you start entered
[33:11.800 --> 33:15.960]  cups and this becomes a you know such a national thing that people will be like
[33:15.960 --> 33:21.960]  remember back in the day when Marco won that shit pretty cool yeah you know and
[33:21.960 --> 33:26.920]  I hope you like inspire you know I'm always trying to inspire but shit man if
[33:26.920 --> 33:33.140]  you're a big whoever you are grow man grow and get get down in there with the
[33:33.140 --> 33:38.180]  growers and get dirty and show people that you grow you know what I mean
[33:38.180 --> 33:42.780]  that's how I look at it like I you know I can't just sit here and talk about
[33:42.780 --> 33:48.420]  this for you know week on week and year and year on year on end I gotta get out
[33:48.420 --> 33:52.420]  there and show this stuff works you know I mean and so I want to be the torch for
[33:52.420 --> 33:57.340]  that like man I'm man does natural farming and you know he won a belt you
[33:57.340 --> 34:03.460]  know it's and it's not about the belt it's about just the the kind of
[34:03.460 --> 34:08.740]  validating this what we're saying works you know I mean like I'm not behind the
[34:08.740 --> 34:13.460]  scenes buying bottles I'm not I'm doing exactly all the shit I showed on my IG
[34:13.460 --> 34:18.020]  like everything we talked about here is what I do you know I mean it's so it's
[34:18.020 --> 34:24.340]  not difficult once you kind of dial in what you're doing understand it for him
[34:24.340 --> 34:27.580]  gotta understand things that's why I always recommend the books and I told
[34:27.580 --> 34:33.100]  you about the new one a month understand that soil understand those microbes
[34:33.100 --> 34:37.300]  because to me that's that diversity is where you get that diversity in turps
[34:37.300 --> 34:42.460]  and we're gonna reach out to the other winners well I'd like to get his point
[34:42.460 --> 34:47.060]  of view I'm I bet you he's gonna say similar things because it's not we're
[34:47.060 --> 34:51.620]  not making it up I'm not trying to just like do this new cool natural farming
[34:51.620 --> 34:55.540]  thing cuz it's cool and just ride that wave I'm letting you know that hey I
[34:55.540 --> 35:00.780]  dropped everything else got on this and this stuff works you know that's all
[35:00.780 --> 35:05.540]  that's awesome you know I mean for me it's just like it feels good man because
[35:05.540 --> 35:10.500]  it feels good to know that like damn like this was a fair one you know
[35:10.500 --> 35:17.620]  everybody's shot a fair one and and you know I was able to be on top and but
[35:17.620 --> 35:21.820]  that doesn't mean that if you didn't win only one guy can win the top belt
[35:21.820 --> 35:25.540]  but there's everybody's winning if you're out there getting into it you're
[35:25.540 --> 35:29.580]  winning because you're learning you grow you're getting better you understand all
[35:29.580 --> 35:32.900]  what I brought to the table might not have been that great as I thought you
[35:32.900 --> 35:39.220]  know I mean that's that's learning too we all can learn that you know they all
[35:39.220 --> 35:43.860]  just cuz it has a big name you got to grow it out you got a dry right you got
[35:43.860 --> 35:48.460]  a cure right you gotta take your time with it you got a handle it neat you
[35:48.460 --> 35:53.100]  gotta I remember the funny thing is cat when I dropped off my sample to you and
[35:53.100 --> 35:57.420]  I don't even know who the gentleman is but when I was leaving out of the cafe a
[35:57.420 --> 36:02.140]  guy was rushing in to hand his sample off I could tell he was in a hurry is
[36:02.140 --> 36:06.420]  running bumped in dinner bumped into me coming in I was like okay he's in a
[36:06.420 --> 36:11.660]  hurry I was like damn he's either like got some fire in there or he's late with
[36:11.660 --> 36:17.460]  his stuff you know I mean last minute so you know I mean it's just like things
[36:17.460 --> 36:20.780]  like that you just remember and it's all just kind of part of the overall
[36:20.780 --> 36:26.140]  competition but it's pretty cool man dropping off of your hard-earned flower
[36:26.140 --> 36:31.220]  that you worked for to almost a stranger you know in public and just seeing what
[36:31.220 --> 36:36.740]  happens so it's pretty cool process hey Marco real quick our interview that we

[37:26.060 --> 37:30.140]  speak to Mackie shout out Mackie they're like where we were you know what I mean
[37:30.140 --> 37:34.620]  in London like it's scary over there kicking the doors and things like that

[37:57.540 --> 38:01.300]  where you guys just focusing on that kind of that one event you know in the
[38:01.300 --> 38:11.180]  DMV area yeah yeah we we are production staff so we do have other conferences
[38:11.180 --> 38:15.780]  and things that we've we've helped out with that come here to DC we also have
[38:15.780 --> 38:23.900]  you are part of our VIP program we have actually year-round parties as well so
[38:23.900 --> 38:29.940]  if you're in the area for those and then like I mentioned we're gonna be doing a
[38:29.940 --> 38:35.540]  event for some of the bands that weren't able to play the education some
[38:35.540 --> 38:41.900]  of the other things that we were able to showcase on the the Saturday on the 22nd
[38:41.900 --> 38:46.500]  so we'll be having that you know definitely stay tuned for that but yeah
[38:46.500 --> 38:51.000]  you know we day before something the Thursday before the festival we had the
[38:51.000 --> 38:58.160]  first cannabis National Cannabis Summit a form to me at the Capitol this year so
[38:58.160 --> 39:04.800]  that was pretty sweet you know it's amazing to have you know anything of
[39:04.800 --> 39:11.520]  that nature be held you know at the state's National Capital Capitol so you
[39:11.520 --> 39:15.520]  know shout out to Caroline you know she's been creating a really really
[39:15.520 --> 39:22.680]  amazing full week actually we call it 420 week of events when it is where you
[39:22.680 --> 39:28.600]  know the week before we have everything from 420 food week that week to a whole
[39:28.600 --> 39:32.640]  bunch of different parties and things that are going on as well so yeah we're
[39:32.640 --> 39:37.160]  really looking forward to next year and if you happen to be planning your 420
[39:37.160 --> 39:41.640]  for next year we definitely have you covered leading up to that you can come
[39:41.640 --> 39:47.200]  into the DMV stay here for at least a week and figure out how to get on that
[39:47.200 --> 39:53.440]  airplane ride home after you can you can rest assured that there's always
[39:53.440 --> 39:57.920]  something to do and then we also take advantage of being you know so close to
[39:57.920 --> 40:04.320]  the Capitol and and you know to you know get in front of representatives and you
[40:04.320 --> 40:09.240]  know still still fight the fight just like what you're talking about man you
[40:09.240 --> 40:14.160]  know we're really thankful here in DC and Virginia and hopefully Maryland you
[40:14.160 --> 40:18.920]  know as they come online but there's a lot of states a lot of places that you
[40:18.920 --> 40:24.680]  know people have some access people have no access you know it's it's crazy out
[40:24.680 --> 40:32.120]  there so we are pretty blessed here to be able to have that and yeah I remember
[40:32.120 --> 40:35.240]  those days I'm originally from California so I've been working industry
[40:35.240 --> 40:44.880]  since 2004 so yeah definitely it's I'm also not used to like you know sit in
[40:44.880 --> 40:49.000]  front of the camera and coming out of the closet kind of a thing for sure so
[40:49.000 --> 40:55.320]  I still kind of get a little you know it's a little weird driving down to
[40:55.320 --> 41:02.640]  Virginia but it is an amazing thing to be able to see and you guys are just
[41:02.640 --> 41:07.080]  doing great stuff down there I know sometimes one step forward two steps
[41:07.080 --> 41:13.000]  back with some of the legislation stuff but you know that's that's I think we
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.080]  all are used to that by now and as long as we step you know in the right
[41:18.080 --> 41:22.600]  direction and keep moving that that ball forward I think it's gonna be you know
[41:22.600 --> 41:28.800]  great for everyone exactly yeah yeah man I agree and so everything y'all are
[41:28.800 --> 41:32.360]  doing is all you know it's all part of that part of the battle man you know
[41:32.360 --> 41:36.440]  just to kind of keep things keep things moving in the right direction that's
[41:36.440 --> 41:40.400]  good that you know the legislation side of it is important to you know what I
[41:40.400 --> 41:44.480]  mean so yeah are you familiar with Keith Stroop
[41:44.480 --> 41:54.400]  yeah yeah where's he out of I think he's in DC I could I could be wrong but he's
[41:54.400 --> 42:01.640]  he created the normal he's yes yeah yeah yeah yes yeah so he's so connected
[42:01.640 --> 42:05.640]  like if you have questions or something like that he was able to guide us in the
[42:05.640 --> 42:12.280]  Denver normal program or not program whatever that's called legislative body
[42:12.280 --> 42:16.280]  but we were really trying to make a difference and I remember being
[42:16.280 --> 42:19.320]  fortunate enough to like kind of spoke with him on the sidewalk and people were
[42:19.320 --> 42:22.720]  giving his dirty looks and he's like ah fuck them this is our freedom or something
[42:22.960 --> 42:28.520]  of that manner so I like his tenacity and I think that he's happy to share his
[42:28.520 --> 42:31.160]  knowledge for individuals like yourself that are really trying to make a
[42:31.160 --> 42:36.960]  difference because not cannabis wasn't always seen especially growing up in the
[42:36.960 --> 42:42.200]  South as a beneficial thing it's almost like you know you're a loser you you've
[42:42.200 --> 42:47.680]  decided not to do anything with your life and as I was used to hustling that
[42:47.680 --> 42:50.120]  kind of thing like a lot of the customers that we had I started to
[42:50.120 --> 42:54.080]  notice these these individuals had a lot of stuff going for them so I started
[42:54.080 --> 42:57.960]  to realize that there's a whole nother side of cannabis is just nobody ever
[42:57.960 --> 43:02.560]  talked about it was just I needed new friends basically because we would sit
[43:02.560 --> 43:06.080]  around and play video games all day at that point in my life and obviously
[43:06.080 --> 43:10.400]  that's that has nothing to do with cannabis so I think just kind of
[43:10.400 --> 43:15.640]  learning about that moving forward and now it's so mainstream I think that's
[43:15.640 --> 43:19.400]  why we're all starting to show our faces you're saying you're out media and stuff
[43:19.400 --> 43:22.840]  just a few years ago like Marco had mentioned nobody wanted to do that so
[43:22.840 --> 43:28.560]  that we're taking giant leaps forward as a community and I'm so thankful that
[43:28.560 --> 43:33.400]  more people are finding out that they can farm using mother nature that she's
[43:33.400 --> 43:37.640]  figured it out a long long time ago and we don't need to kind of reinvent things
[43:37.640 --> 43:42.240]  if you just trust the process believe in that you're gonna find success for
[43:42.240 --> 43:45.960]  yourself and I hope more people then realize that now you get to focus on the
[43:45.960 --> 43:49.520]  genetics like obviously Marco's got his stuff down right so that's another
[43:49.520 --> 43:53.920]  reason why maybe he's getting all these little extra you know attributes because
[43:53.920 --> 43:57.720]  he has more time to sit down and be like all right what do I want to do and one
[43:57.720 --> 44:01.520]  of my fondest memories Marco when we were out there even though you had lost
[44:01.520 --> 44:04.800]  we decided to go to a really nice restaurant you're sitting out there Sun
[44:04.800 --> 44:08.360]  is shining and I could see that your wheels were already spinning you were
[44:08.360 --> 44:12.760]  talking to us but your mind was fucking you know thousand miles elsewhere man
[44:12.760 --> 44:17.040]  while we were out there and I I just it's fun to see when your friends you
[44:17.040 --> 44:20.040]  know it's great to have success man but when your friends are finding success
[44:20.040 --> 44:24.040]  and you realize that this is something that they wanted and you know I I saw
[44:24.040 --> 44:27.800]  you wanting that and contemplating this when we were on that little picnic table
[44:27.800 --> 44:34.360]  so it's cool to see but yeah man I was like thinking damn man these guys was
[44:34.360 --> 44:38.440]  like my child you know to a couple of my childhood friends and Brian you know a
[44:38.440 --> 44:42.440]  good friend from now but it's like man these guys flew all out here you know
[44:42.440 --> 44:47.000]  it was for the festival and all too but you know deep down inside man when your
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.280]  buddies come out you want to have a great showing and so on it was pretty
[44:51.280 --> 44:56.800]  ironic because like with the weather and everything I was like all alone on this
[44:56.800 --> 45:00.520]  one like the one you win is just like it's just you you know my wife came up
[45:00.520 --> 45:06.880]  with me and stuff but yeah it's you know it's all good man it's all love so
[45:06.880 --> 45:11.640]  whatever happened was supposed to happen for a reason and it did and so
[45:11.640 --> 45:15.480]  you know it's all good it's all good.
[45:15.480 --> 45:36.840]  Hey Kat I kind of wanted to you know ask you from behind the scenes like what are you seeing are you you know you said it's two years in that you've been doing this you've been in the industry since 2004 I mean a lot of things have changed we like to call these things kind of like gold bars if you will like industry insights that you could potentially give our audience that you that they
[45:36.840 --> 45:43.160]  might not necessarily have seen since you are behind the scenes of such a large production.
[45:43.360 --> 45:49.200]  Yeah I mean you know it's it's this is my second year actually working with
[45:49.200 --> 45:54.200]  festival so I think I got brought in to work you know work with them specifically
[45:54.200 --> 46:00.760]  for the competition you know I have been you know growing and working in the
[46:00.760 --> 46:06.880]  industry since 2004 originally in San Diego and Southern California and then
[46:06.880 --> 46:16.640]  came out here in 2013 working for the medical dispensaries and cultivation
[46:16.640 --> 46:23.200]  centers out here so been out here for the most part ever since and you know
[46:23.200 --> 46:28.360]  it's it's been a pretty gnarly ride but pretty sweet here watching everything
[46:28.360 --> 46:34.360]  kind of slowly expand and allowing people have more access especially home
[46:34.360 --> 46:38.920]  growing I think that's been you know the biggest impact and as a grower myself
[46:38.920 --> 46:45.120]  knowing the therapeutic value of just getting your hands on a plant as well as
[46:45.120 --> 46:50.480]  just being able to have access to fresh cannabis I think is you know invaluable
[46:50.480 --> 46:56.920]  and should be you know allowed for everyone that given that chance you know
[46:56.960 --> 47:01.160]  but as far as you know I would just honestly tell people to keep going you
[47:01.160 --> 47:08.240]  know keep you know watching and asking questions watching shows like you guys
[47:08.240 --> 47:14.720]  podcast you know just you know there's always new things and you know I always
[47:14.720 --> 47:20.360]  tell people there's you know a hundred ways in skin a cat right so everyone you
[47:20.360 --> 47:25.920]  know meeting everyone where they're at to you know we our industry comes with a
[47:25.920 --> 47:31.920]  lot of egos I also say everyone's smoking their own shit so once you kind
[47:31.920 --> 47:36.880]  of understand that and you can kind of humble yourself I think that's you know
[47:36.880 --> 47:41.160]  actually we're gonna succeed the most you know just like what you're talking
[47:41.160 --> 47:46.320]  about Marco you know your losses are also your victories you got to shoot the
[47:46.320 --> 47:50.800]  ball to be able to make it as well as miss it so you know just getting it out
[47:50.800 --> 47:56.560]  there and trying new things but also you know you don't have to break you
[47:56.560 --> 48:01.640]  don't have to reinvent the wheel just like what Brian was talking about
[48:01.640 --> 48:05.800]  mother nature is really you know handed it off to us we just kind of really have
[48:05.800 --> 48:13.160]  to hone in on what she's telling us so you know constantly refining being open
[48:13.160 --> 48:19.400]  to new skills but also sticking to what you know is you know I think the balance
[48:19.400 --> 48:25.160]  for success yeah damn that was those were gold bars you know one of the ones
[48:25.160 --> 48:28.880]  you said it then sticking to what you know is key you know what I mean and
[48:28.880 --> 48:33.400]  sometimes you don't know what you don't know you know that's where that open
[48:33.400 --> 48:40.000]  mind you don't know what you don't know and man I'm always trying to learn
[48:40.000 --> 48:45.960]  myself you know shit so I'm the same way you just just keep that open mind you
[48:45.960 --> 48:51.400]  know I mean I would love to grow grow another strain have another good strength
[48:51.400 --> 48:55.560]  like it's just keep it going whether you're gonna go in a competition or not
[48:55.560 --> 49:00.440]  you want to keep your quality I was thinking to myself kind of like if
[49:00.440 --> 49:04.560]  there's like an average right there's a line where you're average or above it or
[49:04.560 --> 49:10.200]  below it always at least at the very minimum be above that line you know I
[49:10.200 --> 49:15.600]  mean always be above on the on that side working towards getting as high above
[49:15.720 --> 49:20.560]  averages you can be you know I mean and some people probably don't even think
[49:20.560 --> 49:26.880]  about that but and they settled you know kind of be below average but being above
[49:26.880 --> 49:30.920]  our just it's not that hard to be above average you know what I mean you just
[49:30.920 --> 49:36.560]  have to get into stuff do it and try to figure out some principles behind it
[49:36.560 --> 49:40.400]  while you're doing it and you could really you know you know it's not that
[49:40.400 --> 49:46.160]  difficult for I'm sorry Marco go ahead now I just rambling on I wanted to say
[49:46.160 --> 49:50.120]  for people that are into data for what you're talking about one of the books
[49:50.120 --> 49:54.360]  that gave me one of the aha moments for what Marco is saying is this book by
[49:54.360 --> 49:58.840]  Malcolm Gladwell outliers he talks about 10,000 hours I think there's a lot of
[49:58.840 --> 50:04.240]  truth to that I think there's a lot of data in that book that could suffice I
[50:04.240 --> 50:07.960]  think a lot of maybe skeptic minds of if you really put the time and effort into
[50:08.080 --> 50:11.040]  something and you realize that this doesn't happen in just a few months
[50:11.040 --> 50:15.480]  you're not going to be some elite cannabis farmer in just a few months but
[50:15.480 --> 50:19.600]  the reality is that within just a few years you can start to achieve that and
[50:19.600 --> 50:23.560]  that was extremely hard to do back in the day nobody wanted to share any of
[50:23.560 --> 50:27.280]  their secrets everybody had whatever their little secret recipe was it was
[50:27.280 --> 50:31.680]  usually in bloom so sometimes maybe they'd help a little bit veg but nobody
[50:31.680 --> 50:35.520]  was sharing anything except them maybe on the forums so for individuals that
[50:35.520 --> 50:39.800]  are first getting into this to me you're on an elevator scale like we had
[50:39.800 --> 50:43.960]  to take the stairs you guys are on an elevator straight up and now that you
[50:43.960 --> 50:47.760]  see that Marco's being able to have his his ideas and all that kind of stuff
[50:47.760 --> 50:51.680]  which all a lot of us that's the reason why you know this show is so popular is
[50:51.680 --> 50:56.640]  because there's so many other ways like Kat had mentioned to cook and find a way
[50:56.640 --> 51:03.200]  to finish out the the cannabis but the easiest route in our opinion from the
[51:03.200 --> 51:07.720]  educational side of things and just finding success is focused on trusting
[51:07.720 --> 51:10.760]  in mother nature and then when you trust in that it's going to give you more time
[51:10.760 --> 51:15.240]  to focus on IPM because most individuals are going to get cocky and they're going
[51:15.240 --> 51:20.080]  to eventually have some kind of huge pest issue so going through all those
[51:20.080 --> 51:25.120]  motions you're gonna come back to I need to keep it simple and I need to find
[51:25.120 --> 51:29.160]  genetics that are worth hunting and pheno hunting out things that actually
[51:29.160 --> 51:33.280]  matter and make a difference and then growing those out and Marco has talked
[51:33.280 --> 51:37.400]  about that he's given you guys the playbook for basically two years now so
[51:37.400 --> 51:41.120]  I hope that more of you will go back and spend the time and go down the rabbit
[51:41.120 --> 51:46.640]  hole and see that there is something to growing with the microbial world natural
[51:46.640 --> 51:52.720]  farming all the regenerative farming all those umbrella terms the reality is it's
[51:52.720 --> 51:58.040]  just mother nature and I think that is being shown hopefully all over the
[51:58.040 --> 52:03.120]  country you know Marco and I are able to interview a lot of people cat from
[52:03.120 --> 52:08.040]  Michigan which I don't think outside of maybe the the core cannabis community
[52:08.040 --> 52:11.600]  people know that there's a lot of bright minds out there changing things and
[52:11.600 --> 52:16.040]  finding the genetics and Oklahoma's in another space beliefs even out there
[52:16.040 --> 52:21.080]  where we've interviewed him a few times I mean there's some again elevators from
[52:21.080 --> 52:24.000]  not only learning how to do this but going straight to the source with some
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.440]  of these breeders I mean you guys can DM them a lot of them actually they
[52:27.440 --> 52:32.280]  themselves will respond to you on that so I hope that you remember this and run
[52:32.280 --> 52:36.720]  with it that you can find success for yourself in just a few years and yes
[52:36.720 --> 52:40.080]  it's gonna take that long but theoretically man that's really not that
[52:40.080 --> 52:46.640]  long to find a higher higher success rate for yourself then maybe even going
[52:46.640 --> 52:50.680]  to like a four-year college or putting in time and effort so there's there's
[52:50.680 --> 52:58.080]  a lot of ways to get there and this is one of them well I definitely want to
[52:58.080 --> 53:02.360]  respect your time to cat I know I wasn't sure how long you had so I want to jump
[53:02.360 --> 53:08.280]  in and just see how you're looking I appreciate it guys yeah I do have to hop
[53:08.280 --> 53:13.640]  but I really appreciate the time you know I could definitely you know hang
[53:13.640 --> 53:20.520]  out and talk forever of course about growing and cannabis and all things
[53:20.840 --> 53:28.160]  but you know you guys you know get it I gotta get going but man just thank you

[55:05.280 --> 55:10.040]  thinking about and so I'm already excited as I can tell you ours too so
[55:10.040 --> 55:17.360]  thank you guys thank you I appreciate you coming back thanks again thanks yeah
[55:17.560 --> 55:23.640]  yeah Marco I wanted to I wanted to dive more into like your your thoughts on
[55:23.640 --> 55:27.640]  breeding because obviously you're making decisions I was there when you made the
[55:27.640 --> 55:32.080]  top ten your pictures were up there but you know you didn't bring it home so
[55:32.080 --> 55:36.520]  then you're sitting at the picnic table that next that was on Saturday we're
[55:36.520 --> 55:40.240]  sitting there on like Sunday afternoon you're already thinking about what am I
[55:40.240 --> 55:44.640]  gonna do differently you know the wheels were spinning I think most people that
[55:44.640 --> 55:49.520]  know you could could easily tell that about you so what was it from that
[55:49.520 --> 55:54.240]  moment in time to now this moment in time where you knew okay I need to run
[55:54.240 --> 55:58.280]  with this I'm still sticking with belief like what what was that thought
[55:58.280 --> 56:07.640]  process yeah man it was um what it was is it just went back to I just needed to
[56:07.640 --> 56:11.560]  find someone more turps like it I just knew you know obviously I already know
[56:11.560 --> 56:16.360]  that ain't about the looks looks as part of if you're gonna jump into a
[56:16.360 --> 56:21.000]  competition but from that point I was just like all right you know how am I
[56:21.000 --> 56:26.720]  gonna keep what's my quickest way to get what I wanted and what I wanted was a
[56:26.720 --> 56:33.240]  good-looker with a lot of turps and one that's so the work has already been done
[56:33.240 --> 56:37.680]  so I was like let me just pop believe shit cuz I was like already on I liked
[56:37.680 --> 56:45.160]  what he was doing so he gifted me some his divine truffle I'll tell you that
[56:45.160 --> 56:49.840]  collab he did gifted me those seeds and I started when I started working through
[56:49.840 --> 56:55.080]  on them and I immediately like if it didn't have any kind of like if the
[56:55.080 --> 56:59.120]  turps weren't there early I just was like I was done like I was already just
[56:59.120 --> 57:02.800]  being aggressive about it you know what I mean where I was just like cutting you
[57:02.800 --> 57:08.240]  know cutting down just to kind of weed out and get to the best quick because I
[57:08.240 --> 57:13.320]  had what I did was I was I was like all right I'm gonna go I'm gonna win this
[57:13.320 --> 57:19.800]  competition right so the timing for me was like around it ended up being like
[57:19.800 --> 57:24.000]  September when I really found and dialed in on the on this plant right
[57:24.000 --> 57:30.160]  here but I still wasn't a hundred so I grew it with five other plants in the
[57:30.160 --> 57:38.280]  same same three by three so I grew Farmer John's peach maraschino max
[57:38.280 --> 57:48.040]  yields Oreos cut both of these are cuts I had a cush that I had found from
[57:48.040 --> 57:53.240]  another from B Leafs cush cut I had got some seeds like five or six seeds
[57:53.240 --> 57:57.600]  brewed him out and found me a new cush so I replaced his cush with my cush and
[57:57.600 --> 58:05.480]  then I had this one called pump gas shout out 710 genetics right there in DC
[58:05.480 --> 58:10.920]  pump gas he is a guy my man he told me he said he said here man I'm gonna give
[58:10.920 --> 58:14.760]  you some seeds he said grow these next to all your big growers he's like he's
[58:14.760 --> 58:18.040]  cocky what he was confident right he's like grow these were next to believe
[58:18.040 --> 58:25.400]  from anybody so I did and at first and you can't judge a book about his first
[58:25.400 --> 58:29.880]  cover at first he was lagging when his shit was lagging behind like yeah I
[58:29.880 --> 58:34.080]  shouldn't agree you with these hard hitters in here you know you ain't ready
[58:34.080 --> 58:40.200]  but then man that plant turned on bro so like oh like seven weeks in that thing
[58:40.200 --> 58:44.160]  started shining and stinking like as good as almost anything in amongst those
[58:44.760 --> 58:49.600]  so it was that one and it was this there was this truffle that I had already
[58:49.600 --> 58:55.600]  selected so those were six plants and I said well I want to go on a run to you
[58:55.600 --> 58:59.840]  know I want to run to because I ain't sure if people want fruity or people on
[58:59.840 --> 59:04.400]  gas you know and I figured DC though they're close enough to us it's the hood
[59:04.400 --> 59:08.200]  as I call it DC they want that cush they like cuz
[59:08.200 --> 59:15.280]  Kush had won the year before it's like a Sunday Sunday driver Kush he won it's
[59:15.280 --> 59:19.000]  all like damn they you know they like that Kush that the Terps so then I just
[59:19.000 --> 59:23.480]  was dialing in and saying alright who's got the best Terps as on the six that I
[59:23.480 --> 59:28.880]  was kind of working with and I really just dialed it down man I was like you
[59:28.880 --> 59:32.240]  know the Oreos cut was just kind of in there because it was famous you know
[59:32.240 --> 59:36.520]  like famous car I'm gonna keep that in there just in case but it didn't have
[59:36.520 --> 59:41.440]  the other Terps like what I was looking for and then the peach maraschino is the
[59:41.440 --> 59:47.360]  other one I entered so I did enter farmer John's peach and so out of
[59:47.360 --> 59:52.880]  Virginia my those two my what I call my divine pine and the peach came out of
[59:52.880 --> 59:59.280]  there in the top ten in Virginia and then and it's both of them and then so
[59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.200]  she you know then it was like okay cool so they went to the next round of
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:07.640]  judging and then you know what you know peach dropped off and divine pine ended
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:11.040]  up being you know topless whatever but you know that's kind of my thought
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.480]  process man I wanted to get I knew I had a year I wanted a year to have something
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:22.920]  really unique in there and I grew genome kind of in that window too but genomes
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:28.600]  he was finishing too late I started on too late so the Fantasia's were
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:32.840]  finishing just too close to the window for when I because I wanted at least two
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:38.160]  months you know month and a half two months in the jar pretty much and so
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.040]  before I submitted so he was too close so I didn't run the Fantasia's although
[01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:47.960]  I did pick one of those that I'm keeping to run again so and then on breeding
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:55.080]  man so I got a Fantasia that I really love and then I had King J's
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:00.720]  Mendolicious which is off the Mendo breath like you know man and that
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:07.680]  Mendolicious man all those plants are just ridiculous so I hit my Fantasia's
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:13.440]  with a Mendolicious male and then now that's what I'm that's the thing I'm
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:18.800]  about to start working on is King J genome Fantasia and Mendolicious I'm
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:24.000]  gonna find something out of there that's my next stuff that's awesome dude
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.320]  yeah and I'm not like you know and I know it's like here's my thing guys like
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:35.880]  I'm just dabbling and breeding for me for me to find these strains but you
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.960]  notice what I'm doing I'm taking stuff that's been worked really nicely and
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.360]  combining it you know I mean I want to hedge my bets I want to get two things
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:48.040]  without see like because the Mendo Mendolicious is very consistent like all
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:54.280]  it should a super frosty pretty hues reminds me that outcast song how high
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:59.200]  yellows and blues and greens and grays and hues you know all of that so all
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:04.840]  them different colors in there on top of it now with the Fantasia I found a girl
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:11.480]  that seemed like she was super fast and loud you know said she he never seen one
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.640]  that fast so I'm gonna I'm running her again to see if she's super fast so I'm
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:21.840]  just on stuff like that man I just want loud stuff unique stuff different turf
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.320]  man your belts are clanking together you sound like soldier boy on the breakfast
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.600]  club I'm not about to take this sit down all them hey so real quick I want you to
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.920]  explain that the grand champion because that's more of what we have always joked
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.840]  around as the people's choice so I wanted you to kind of talk on that
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:43.200]  because it's great to win when the judges and that that you know it's
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.440]  validation really I mean that's that's kind of what that is when you feel like
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:51.520]  peers or people that have been legacy farmers and stuff out there it seemed
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.200]  like when we were out there last year I mean they had kind of the who's who and
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:00.360]  that educational panel yeah so if those individuals are are the judges then I
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:05.200]  think that's why this is a cool little event man or not a little event a major
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:10.200]  yeah I like how they're good man I like how they brought in good heads like good
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.880]  minds for everything but like so you got you see these are two different size
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:19.920]  belts so this one the smaller one is um what it was this year was like she said
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:27.120]  it was Maryland Virginia versus DC and so the smaller belt is the was the
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:33.600]  Virginia State you know champ and what they did was they did DC champ versus
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:39.200]  Virginia champ rejudged and then the judges picked you know the grand champ
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:44.600]  now there's other two also other two other big belts which were the terpenes
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:51.000]  and the connect and a THC and those are won by the other gentleman with the
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:59.240]  monkey monkey berries and they said it was really close though they said I was
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:03.880]  trying to pull up my report you know for divine pine but I got it right here but
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.000]  um they say the numbers are really close she said it was down to the points on
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.760]  the terpenes because divine pine was like 4.1% terpenes which is high you
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.320]  know I was like I was like oh shit I'm hopefully I can at least win at one of
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.400]  the lab awards I didn't think I would win like the grand champion were
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:28.760]  selected by all the judges and stuff and the THC was 27 you know what I'm
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:35.780]  saying so it was she's a heavy hitter um now that means that my man stuff was
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:38.820]  hitting just that much harder apparently on the number side you know
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:43.020]  what I mean and I used to say man I don't care about the judges you know
[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:46.900]  just give me the numbers you know number side but you know after Kat kind of
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:51.860]  explained it her opinion of it and I and I should ask her to get into it on the
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:57.980]  show she said that you know terpenes were really close and that what it what
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:05.460]  her breaker was was that the terpenes in divine pine were just had more levels to
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:09.660]  them where it just had a little more depth up and down between different
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:15.180]  turps where his was very terpy and strong and more probably concentrated to
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:20.460]  one turp you know if that makes sense but you know hey man it is what it is
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:25.420]  it's nice to be you know take a W especially for me uh you know like I'll
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:29.860]  take grand champ you know I mean that's like top of the top and that's the big
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:35.380]  dog but um yes you mainly and not in pining wasn't even the main turf you
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:41.020]  know surprisingly it was limonene but it had a lot of cara carafe lane in
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:46.820]  there too was this number two so I guess sometimes when these turps combine you
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:51.420]  get those different kind of you know have pining in there was the fourth
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:57.300]  highest herb I I think it was Duke it might have been somebody else but one of
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:00.980]  the older heads was talking about one day that terpene percentages like that
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:06.780]  should be looked upon like swimming and seconds right like a second in swimming
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:13.020]  is a huge difference so when it comes to terpenes like to go from even 3% to 4%
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:17.140]  you're talking a major difference so for you to already be hitting those numbers
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.940]  you know you're gonna go back to the lab you're gonna think about some things I'm
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:28.140]  sure and you come back and figure that out man so the blueprint I think for
[01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:32.540]  most people that hopefully get excited sitting here watching you with your
[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:38.620]  validation belts is that anybody can do this and they don't necessarily need
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:44.420]  really anything other than time and maybe a little space downstairs or you
[01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:48.620]  know this can even be achieved for the most part with with tent farming I mean
[01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:53.060]  this is this is just uh just what quality can you can you bring to the
[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:56.900]  table and that was was cool about this event is you didn't have to have like a
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:07:04.020]  storefront to even be able to enter so the small-time individual I don't I
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:08.420]  don't mean that in a disrespect Marco but it's like you're carrying it for the
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:12.460]  torch for the small-time the homegrowers like look you just whooped up on all
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:17.060]  those big brands they were sponsored by all the big names we don't need to talk
[01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:21.500]  about them but they were there right and so I would imagine that they wish that
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:26.260]  they would have been able to bring that home but unfortunately this seemed like
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:31.260]  it was actually fairly done and the microbial world was shining through and
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:35.780]  you guys are the chefs you guys were cooking you you know your entrees and
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:40.500]  the way that you guys did and you came out on top man and it's hopefully
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:45.700]  invigorating for people that want to jump into this now or finally actually
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:50.460]  start growing this summer because I feel like every year man people talk about
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:54.580]  oh this is the year this is my year to do this right you check up on and they
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:08:00.180]  got a whole story on why they haven't started yeah and you know what man I
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:03.860]  was doing so I was doing some more some research because when I you know my when
[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:08.540]  I was at okay 4.1 I'm like that sounds pretty good cuz you know I don't do a
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:13.060]  lot of lab testing cuz I'm I don't know I'm tight I don't give a fuck I can tell
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:17.340]  I know when the shit is fire and I'm like it's fire so but I don't do a lot
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:21.020]  of lab testing so I was really excited like I got to get my shit tested for
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:26.740]  free and when I was doing the um the Terps man I was like oh shit I'm 4.1 I
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:31.460]  was like that's high like even so like some of your famous strains may only be
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:37.700]  like two ones and twos but they may be a big strain because they got a hell of a
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:42.780]  high and it is what it is you know it ain't all about just the numbers but to
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:47.620]  be high in Terps like that I was very um I was very very happy man I want and
[01:08:47.620 --> 01:08:53.100]  now I can't wait to go ahead and dry sift some and then see what though how
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:56.500]  that's popping off then you know and that like you said taking it to that
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:02.420]  next you know on to the next level with the note non solventless you know I mean
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:07.660]  absolutely and you know at least here in Denver man the heady individuals or so
[01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:11.500]  called heady individuals when they walk into a dispensary they love still see
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:17.100]  Terp THC percentages some of them over Terpene percentages so if you have one
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:22.620]  that's hitting 27 plus 4% and I think more in the community are starting to
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:26.740]  at least know what those numbers mean that would be flying off the shelves man
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:31.660]  so I hope that more people see that the good stuff is being done by the hoodies
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:36.260]  the small-time folk the people that are working with the breeders and going to
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:40.500]  the Expos and finding that kind of stuff and we've been talking about that for
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.140]  years now so I hope that you guys see that you can you can find success for
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:47.740]  yourself putting in the work and realizing that it doesn't happen in
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:54.460]  months and if you talk to other farmers when they are not necessarily farmers
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:58.820]  but others in the industry sometimes those suits they kind of make it sound
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:02.780]  like if you use certain products that you're gonna just find the ultimate
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:07.260]  success and that doesn't happen that way experience is how you're able to manage
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:11.300]  this kind of stuff so you need to realize that yes you obviously need to
[01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:15.940]  get that experience going so start today start going out getting getting
[01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:20.180]  the stuff that you need start your worm farm at least you know there's there's
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.460]  so many different ways to kind of start that process while you're still learning
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:28.580]  but I hope that this is inspires man and I would imagine that more people are
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.460]  gonna listen to what you're saying Marco because you're giving this shit out for
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:36.180]  free man there's no patreon there's no paywall you know the homies just
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:40.500]  literally giving it back in the day like an OG hey this is how I'm riding around
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:44.780]  on these Cadillacs this is how I do it but it's different now you know this is
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:49.460]  a whole new era for individuals that kind of like the gray world but realize
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:53.660]  that that that world is over with so you can kind of come out and realize that
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:58.540]  this is something if it's near and dear to your heart you can you can find a way
[01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:02.100]  and you find your own little niche and sell your own products and enter in the
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:08.180]  cups and especially to you know KJ that's the we've said I think a couple
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:12.260]  times Marco those are the guys that we would love to see more of guys that are
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:18.860]  young putting in the work that also seem to have an eye for genetics yeah man hey
[01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:24.500]  and I ain't gonna lie man I'm playing I did a bunch of those King J's like 20
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:28.940]  you know a bunch you know I'm homegrown guy you know me I got I run five I got
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:36.460]  five um five lighter you know I mean I run five different living soils you know
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:45.580]  I mean all of them are rising on now and um but uh King J man like every plant
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:49.900]  was just so frosty and sweet they're different now they're all of them one
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:53.820]  like I didn't want to grow them all because some of them were very small but
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:58.060]  every one of them had that quality about it you know I mean it's like wow like
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:01.500]  it's like damn I like that when you don't you know 20 and they're all like
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:06.740]  everyone's fiery in its own little way you know and that's to me that's key man
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:11.580]  is you know popping seeds you know you got up you got to you know I mean I got
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:16.440]  you know got this plant out of a seed man you know what I mean and it ain't
[01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:21.060]  like you know super plan like but it's a hell of a man I'm telling you it would
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:25.660]  fly off the shelves and like the way I worked it is because you know starting
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:30.620]  at that first original plan I was I had to give up an ounce because the
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:36.220]  competition was announced so that left me with about that much left just to
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:42.940]  kind of see it through like as I always recommend that keep you ajar too so as
[01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:46.780]  the judges are getting it you can kind of open it and see oh what would the
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:52.700]  judges be feeling how would they be you know how do they like it and so um off
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:56.820]  that original plant you know what I mean I still have you know one original nug
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:04.420]  like you know but I love I love this this plant is so nice man is like no one
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:11.180]  else has even tried it now Kaylee I see you out there you have seeds the seeds I
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:15.460]  blessed you with are out of this winning plant right here you know the one the one
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:20.820]  you know I grew it again from corn for the cup but Kaylee you the only one so
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:25.220]  take cherish those seeds I know you're gonna get some fire out of them and um
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:29.060]  and then I'm just gonna start sharing it too with people man because I think
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:32.340]  it's a wonderful plant it's called divine pine I didn't just name it that
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:37.140]  because like trying to find something catchy like it's very divine like the
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:43.580]  high is very so very nice it's a very nice I'm not great at describing a lot
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:47.620]  of like the turps all the different you know smells like you know Doritos with
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:51.900]  strawberry jelly like you know I'm not into I don't I'm not that good that kind
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:58.460]  of stuff but I'm gonna tell you you'll love this plant it's very nice very you
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:03.620]  know uplifting hi hi we just had a question come in that I actually was
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.940]  gonna talk to you about so I think we might as well kind of bring that up
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:11.220]  people want to know more about your dry and cure and I think obviously now this
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:18.420]  is the perfect time to talk about that because you just want so what what is
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:23.380]  that playbook look like and remember this is in your area you got to remember
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:27.420]  that part too so when I talk in numbers you gotta gotta think about where you're
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:33.460]  what you're doing this is in my area and and I'm gonna go deeper than everyone
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:39.580]  just says okay 60 60 right all right if you can achieve that if you can build a
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:45.580]  room and achieve that sure rock with that but I will say this I do have a dry
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:53.460]  room but my dry room is a little bit dependent upon the ambient humidity and
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:58.660]  mostly humidity temperature I'm good on but the ambient humidity can affect my
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:08.980]  dry room right so what I do is when I first chopped the plant the first about
[01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:13.940]  four days two to four days I don't care what it what the temperature and
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:18.220]  humidity I really don't care I'm gonna chop it and let it just kind of get off
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:24.180]  some of that initial really wetty you know really wet right and then from
[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:29.660]  there about right around that fourth day or whatever now I'm gonna start caring
[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:36.220]  about the humidity that's around it I'm gonna put it in my in my dry room but
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:42.100]  here's the thing you may have to if you can't dial in your dry room and this is
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:47.980]  what I used to do I would just use you have to use bags you can use big trash
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:55.700]  bags to be your dry room now and to me it's so I thought about it because I'm
[01:15:55.700 --> 01:15:59.660]  like I know people want to know and then but I thought about the way I do it is
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:05.460]  so like different each time just depending on how it goes but in general
[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:12.620]  I want to keep it evenly keep the buds evenly moist through the whole process
[01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:20.340]  so even if I get out of that humidity zone I still want to focus on not
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:26.780]  letting that outside get over crispy and the way I do that is by using you can
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:30.900]  use big trash bags kind of use that or buckets now you can buck down and go
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:37.820]  buckets airtight buckets put them in the bucket pop off the top the next day
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:42.620]  how is it is it moist leave it all you know and it's hard to it's it's really
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:46.060]  guys everyone says this stuff but you have to just get in there and do it it's
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:50.140]  you got to do it by feel like I literally don't squeeze like a lower
[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:55.220]  buds and I touch the buds a lot the lowers I'll pick certain buds I'm always
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:59.340]  gonna check on this one I want you never want to touch any of your top colors or
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:02.500]  any anything like that you're ruining your quality but pick some lowers which
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:09.420]  are fairly dense and use those to kind of gauge and it's that feeling between
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:15.580]  you know crispy which you don't really want to down to like you know marshmallow
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:23.060]  as a feeling in there but keep your temperature cool is what I like to do
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:28.060]  and stay close to 60s as I can if I can go cooler sometimes in the winter I go a
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:32.260]  little even cooler than 60s and then but do keep that humidity from going
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:37.900]  super low on yourself like if you get a day like one day of humidity if you get
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:42.820]  like 35 can ruin you you can kind of be out of the game you can lose a lot of
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:49.020]  turps that way but if you slowly just keep that plant some semi moist and
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:53.940]  slowly dry the slower you can dry it a better you'll keep those turps and like
[01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:58.900]  what I do is because I have that growing with that on drying room I leave whole
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:04.060]  plants in there just hanging like for weeks weeks weeks whole plants and I'm
[01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:07.500]  just checking them and then I get to a certain point I'm like alright it's
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:12.700]  kind of dry enough stems just about snapping and I'll go to bucket you know
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:17.580]  what I mean I like buckets for me they're better than jars buckets are big
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:22.180]  even if you only have a couple ounces but if you want to put whole plants you
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:26.620]  know you can put your whole stems you can buck them down and fit the entire
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:30.740]  stem in the bucket and so that way you're not you know cutting down the
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:36.140]  buds too early I don't like to cut the buds too early you know I like to leave
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:39.620]  them on the branches as long as possible and then I'll cut buck them down the
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:44.260]  buds like when they're like jar ready and by jar ready meaning I can go into a
[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:49.820]  jar now and they won't mold you know what I mean they won't wet back up on me
[01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:54.420]  you know that's key you got to go back and once you go jar still check the next
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:58.180]  day and in two days later because you can get a little bit of residual
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:05.740]  moisture but that's it man it's like a back and forth it's just a tendon to it
[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:10.740]  every you know checking it feeling Oh a little crispy oh I don't like that go in
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:16.380]  the bucket lid on next day up low wet pop it off it's this it's just like that
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:20.780]  and you have to just tend to it every day I think Rod's skateboard said that
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:25.260]  well like what you're saying is the situal awareness kind of just adjusting
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:29.060]  that mindset on a daily walking in there and be like oh no never mind I'm
[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:34.100]  changing to this this idea or that's the game that is the game that's how you do
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:39.980]  it man and for me like that's just how it's evolved and that is it's actually
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:44.420]  literally good because I've done it before like back in a day read the forms
[01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:51.740]  Oh XYZ 6060 let it go don't look you know like it's not like that to really
[01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:57.980]  maximize is to me it's just such a slow back and forth little game like it is
[01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:02.260]  it's like pulling you know and it is like that and I like to keep my fan
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:07.740]  leaves around my colos some of us and it protects them like a crown because I'm
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:11.660]  pulling sometimes I'll pull out of a bucket you know and I want to see what
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:15.860]  I'm working with put back in that way I'm not knocking all the track homes on
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:21.060]  I'm very particular like not tough enough not messing up my trike homes not
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:25.140]  handling rough you know those things that you hear everybody saying those are
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:31.940]  true things definitely handling has a lot to do with it yeah a lot of people
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:36.140]  don't even take the time for a whole plant so do you mind maybe just briefly
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:39.860]  kind of talking on that and why you you know why you feel like that's important
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:48.420]  yeah I like to go whole plant if I can whole plant to me like to here's like
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:53.260]  when I harvest when I'm ready and I'm like all right she's ready and I cut
[01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:59.020]  that whole plant for me I got two or three days of chill I don't have shit
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.740]  that way I don't have to worry about that plant because I put it I got it in
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:06.820]  environment it's not super dry it's not super moist I'm good right but then
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:12.180]  after about that fourth day fifth day six seven going and now I'm on it I got
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:15.340]  to go in there and fuck with it I gotta go down there and look at it I gotta
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:19.740]  mess with it every day see where I'm at you can't like skip a day and be like
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:24.220]  leave it in there you got it just tend to it and I like the whole plant because
[01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:30.460]  to me you get that slower dry I feel like there's something to it you know
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:35.500]  and you hear this a lot like when you first pick a fruit or cut a plant you
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:40.140]  know it doesn't die that second you know what I mean there's enzymes there's
[01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:45.460]  action going on and especially with a cannabis or tobacco or anything like
[01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:50.140]  that where you're slow drying you've got all kinds of processes going on that you
[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:54.220]  want to preserve tobacco is the same way you can't drive tobacco fast and think
[01:21:54.220 --> 01:22:01.940]  it's gonna taste good or you know or burn well same principle slow and low
[01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:08.900]  don't disturb the trichomes don't touch that top Cola I don't touch my colas
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:15.700]  man if I do if I do want to smell that plant because I do that a lot I go a
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:21.900]  little bit lower and if this is the bud I go up under I just reach under and
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:26.140]  massage kind of catch some of that lower I don't touch the top you know where
[01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:30.740]  where we got all our goodness so I just reach under there get my fingers sticky
[01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:35.180]  on the bottom smell what I got you know see what see what she's smelling like
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:40.500]  the nose is key man you gotta trust your own nose you know what I mean but you
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:44.620]  know one of the biggest things Ryan is that I feel like that people can learn
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:49.860]  from is just because you pop this pack you pay for this pack right you pay for
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:55.380]  good money just because you pop this pack and it's a name-brand it doesn't
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:23:00.140]  mean that any of those C's are acceptable to you don't accept you don't
[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:05.220]  have to accept not one seed meaning I'll throw all the plants away if they
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:09.420]  ain't shit I'm sure I paid the guy for his stuff but I won't go back you know
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:14.500]  what I mean but don't settle don't be like well this is just you know whatever
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:18.580]  the brand whatever the name is you know you don't have to pick any of those to
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:24.180]  run like be choosy I'm very picky I'm very choosy you know it'll be some
[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:29.020]  somebody's really good you know famous stuff and if it's if that individual
[01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:33.100]  plant or seed ain't ain't worth it then I'm just gonna cut it I'm not gonna have
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:39.660]  no ties to it I let the plants tell me who's the winner like divine pine she
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:46.060]  said I'm the winner by her actions you know the plants talk to you peach said I
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:50.780]  want to play because peach said my shit is unique this is a very different smell
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:56.300]  you know that farmer John Pete so I said well this is what we're doing you know
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:24:01.500]  I mean like don't fight it don't go against the flow just see what you get
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:06.700]  like you might get nothing you might get shit out of a pack and if that's the
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:12.140]  case it's all you if you want to reach out to the breeder but you know I look
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:16.700]  at it like I'm assuming the breeder did the best he can do every seed ain't
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:22.980]  always a winner you know sometimes they are you know but just be choosy man like
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:27.940]  I'm picking through peach right now farmer John I was blessed I got a few I
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:32.900]  call them love seeds or gift seeds I took that from be leaf like when a bug
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:37.540]  gives me a seed you know and it's a good smoke and then I so I got about six of
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:42.420]  those from the peach and I went through them and I found one I like better than
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:47.580]  farmer John's peach so now I threw that out and now my peach 1.2 is the peach so
[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:52.180]  it's always trying to do a little better you know don't get hooked on that guy
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:57.180]  like oh I gotta keep max yields Oreos forever because that's it is I don't
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:25:04.100]  give a fuck if it's not it was not that thing then don't waste your time yeah we
[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:09.220]  used to call those pearls because they would pop up you know and a lot of
[01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.660]  people obviously get upset about that but if it's water too that could
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:17.620]  potentially be that that thing that you you've been looking for so I think
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:23.220]  understanding the plant on a better scale a faster scale it's going to allow
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:29.100]  you to hunt and maybe not potentially throw away stuff that that is keepers I
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:32.180]  remember this dude gave me something called Frank's gift his name was Frank
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:36.380]  he just I don't to this day I don't know what it was but I wish I would have been
[01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:40.120]  able to keep that kind of stuff because I thought it wasn't didn't have a cool
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:44.900]  name you know all this kind of stuff and you know there's a lot probably a lot of
[01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:48.620]  those things that people wish they could get back and so starting your
[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:52.540]  playbook from day one and realizing that maybe this isn't something that I'm
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:56.420]  going to keep but I'm still gonna or something that I'm too excited about but
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:26:01.620]  at the same time running through people's gear you know running through a
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:04.700]  pack disappointed I've run through another pack of someone's gear and then
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:10.020]  I found something so if it's somebody that you wanna you kind of admire and
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:13.300]  that's why you're running the gear then yeah maybe run a couple if you've spent
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:18.580]  a couple hundred dollars on maybe a kind of like a hype pack if you will and it
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:23.260]  doesn't live up to the hype then that's actually kind of why a lot of us are
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:27.220]  raising a red flag in the industry is because sometimes that's just how that
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:33.180]  is so why not support some of the like smaller time individuals or mom-and-pop
[01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:36.860]  shops that you know you've done the research on and you know they're doing
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:40.940]  the work Marco obviously loves to give credit where credits do you don't
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:44.220]  normally always see that so he's kind of telling you where he's getting his
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:48.140]  beats if you will and then he's writing these lyrics on top of this stuff and
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:52.300]  bringing home the grant so that's what what really matters is that he's giving
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:56.540]  it away in my opinion is that he's giving it away for free and there's just
[01:26:56.540 --> 01:27:00.620]  something to that in life and that's one of the best things that I think traits
[01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:05.860]  about you buddy is that it's always been more like to the community and now it's
[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:10.660]  today is your day to kind of just you know soak in that man and realize that
[01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:16.780]  this community loves you obviously now hopefully next level respects you for
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:20.620]  what you're saying and giving to the community and always giving it for free
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:26.260]  yeah man thanks man I just you know it don't make sense to just you know sit
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:32.460]  here and be a talking head like I can grow to like I said man grow with the
[01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:36.340]  grow with the fellas grow with the people you know I love growing us so it's
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:42.220]  fun you know you know that's why I like this competition because I don't you
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:46.540]  know I don't know none of them folks like it NCC yeah like I don't know no
[01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:50.220]  you know it's not like I know them and you know I don't know anybody so I just
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:54.660]  jumped into this thing and it seemed like it was fair and I know it was fair
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:58.340]  because I lost the first year so you know I mean I'm like yeah man it's
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:06.580]  fucking real shit here like it's real and so um yeah I mean and I just learned
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:11.540]  Brian like there's enough for everybody you know what I mean it used to be like
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:14.820]  back in the day like oh there's a deal on something don't tell nobody though
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:20.700]  you know go get the deal and do it like now man you get more it seems like you
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:26.300]  get more love when you do shit you know spread that love first cuz you know
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:31.420]  that's what me man like I just um I just show what I do that's it like it
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:35.660]  ain't nothing there's nothing real fancy and tricky but now I will say this like
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:40.220]  just talking it through because I gotta do I'm gonna do a talk on this in a few
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:46.580]  weeks but like the for me the keys to really growing the great cannabis the
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:52.300]  where I've come to to this point horizontal soil crafting your own input
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:57.020]  you know harvesting your own ingredients to that building your own
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:03.420]  soil you know getting a good soil recipe dialing in that soil recipe amending it
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:08.180]  you know amended that amended soil you know and once you put that in that
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:13.260]  horizontal man and to me when you add those like river stones and things like
[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:17.740]  that you know that's where you get those big roots you know what I mean roots
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:22.780]  follow water you know river stones to me and Matt power said this to like
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:28.060]  river stones equal big roots because water travels down and roots you know
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:33.320]  follow it you know what I mean so horizontal you know like I've had people
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:38.460]  even say a rise on it doesn't work you know I mean like you're wasting your
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:46.140]  time don't do that indoors you know what I mean and it does work you know building
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:49.860]  that soil is key man but then the genetics just doing a little bit of
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:54.460]  research and finding out finding some good good folks and people we say on
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:58.860]  here you're gonna be you're gonna have good success with but you can't do
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:03.180]  anything with the genetics if you're not kind of you got to have your shit
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:06.500]  together what's growing you know you got to be able to grow or see and through
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:10.700]  see it all the way through and the biggest thing like we said when to chop
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:17.460]  is key so many people rush so many people go early and then the drying
[01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:21.180]  there's nothing more key than that because I've done it in the past I've
[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:27.100]  ruined fucking bud for fast drying caught me off guard dried out troop troop
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:32.660]  troop trying to rehydrate you know I mean is your done deal as far as flower
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:36.820]  now I don't know how that translates to if you want to go to concentrates with
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:41.020]  it but still to me is also a lot of your turps so if you go concentrates
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:45.060]  you're just trying to kind of bring it back to get a little bit you know read
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:51.620]  you know read constituted or whatever in my opinion but yeah roots oh yeah roots
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:55.500]  travel sideways no doubt and in the feeder roots that a lot of people call
[01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:59.100]  them a lot of the feeding happens right at the surface that's why it's key to
[01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:03.340]  have that mulch you know what I mean I'm telling you I have four inches of mulch
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:08.260]  so this gets shredded down and I grow every cycle you know and to me that's
[01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:14.500]  that readily available nitrogen in there to me that's that's part of that secret
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:17.900]  sauce man you have all that life in there you have that biofilm that you
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:22.220]  can't get unless there's life and I think that's part of that secret sauce
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:28.060]  is that you have all of those extra secret sauces to create one champion
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:33.980]  genetic I think moving forward man if you're able to get like four and five
[01:31:33.980 --> 01:31:39.140]  percent twenty seven percent you're not not only you can get the attention of
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:43.860]  like your peers in this world but I would imagine the dispensary owners and
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:47.500]  people the suits kind of paying attention to that kind of stuff those
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:52.580]  numbers would hopefully intrigue them on how you're achieving that especially at
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:59.900]  a smaller scale okay then if you if you added up all of the cost of these inputs
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:04.740]  I bet it's comical compared to some of the other entrants that were competing
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:11.300]  against you this year yeah not like man bro if I was an owner like and this
[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:15.020]  ain't about like I'm not trying to say anything but what I'm saying if I was an
[01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:19.340]  owner I'd be looking for a guy like me a guy that's fucking doing shit cheap
[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:24.740]  finding genetics like I'm not saying don't look for me I'm right here but
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:30.260]  find that like to me be that be this kind of guy like that's if you want to
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:37.740]  be in this industry as a young guy push to find the strongest Terps fine create
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:44.020]  your own kind of growing system with different disciplines
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:49.620]  natural farming permaculture you name it you name it find your own kind of way
[01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:57.140]  your own lane cat said that too and to me that's kind of where you know you can
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:33:01.420]  create a lane if you want to you know be valuable you know create yourself a
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:07.060]  little resume and things like that you know what I mean now it's all open you
[01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:10.500]  know what I mean I don't you know been fun to do you know went about you know
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:16.340]  20 years ago you know I mean when I was 29 you know I'm saying but um you know
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:22.100]  here we are and you know it's it's fun to I mean it's cool man just I mean it's
[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:26.460]  just nice to you know people smoke your shit and said damn you won like that's
[01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:32.420]  pretty cool you know so I know I love it I'm like it's a wonderful wonderful
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:37.020]  plan I can't wait to really share it with some more people soon but after you
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:43.340]  know talking to um the guests we had a couple weeks ago is like man shit
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:50.420]  everybody's out there patenting stuff and protecting brands and stuff I mean
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:56.300]  it's just the world's getting crazy man so you know I don't I want to find a
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:34:01.140]  clever way to kind of just kind of allow people to you know have the plan and
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:08.140]  stuff and I'll do that kind of soon but yeah Kaylee I can't wait to see what
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:12.260]  you find in those seeds I got I got a nice amount of seeds that I kept only
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:19.500]  out of this plant I pollinated all the divine truffles that I got a pollinator
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:23.900]  in the mall so I literally got like thousands of seeds but they're not
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:27.900]  they're not from this winning plant so I literally took all those seeds and just
[01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:33.900]  throw them out I mean I only kept the seeds I just planted the only way that
[01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:37.940]  I was able to do that was I call it putting in the work like you if you want
[01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:41.180]  to do that then you got to go through every piece like if you look like if you
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:45.860]  grow a nice plant and you want you know every once in a while you do find a seed
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:51.060]  in a sack well that whole plant might have five or six seeds well you only got
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:56.740]  a sack you got one of the five so to me I call putting in the work is when I
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:35:00.060]  got to go through that whole plant and make sure that if there is a seed in
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:05.100]  there I found it you know I mean and call it what you want but that's a lot
[01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:08.980]  of work sometimes when you're doing this over and over on plants and you know I
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:15.140]  mean you got all you know a lot of smoking going on you know sometimes so
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:20.340]  sharing with people that you can trust like that hey man if you find a seed but
[01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:23.620]  make sure it's not another seed you know like that's that's difficult like I'll
[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:27.180]  give some of my dad well make sure it's from that yeah I'm pretty sure it came
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:31.980]  out of that now you know I got throw it over there my pile of love seeds just
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:36.660]  random stuff but yeah working through and then finding that it the seeds that
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:39.660]  you you know so because you'll be surprised some of these strains will
[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:42.900]  give you a little bit more seeds than others because I think it's just
[01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:48.740]  genetics like I felt like the King J stuff I feel like I know I'll never find
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:52.460]  a seed in it I feel like it's really tight like that you know what I mean
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:57.620]  where some stuff is not as tight that's cool that's experience to kind of what
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:02.860]  I was saying there like some strains you're just gonna be more apt to have
[01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:07.340]  seeds you know I mean they're not worked as hard or I don't know if that I need a
[01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:10.260]  breeder to tell me if that means they're not worked as hard but what that tells
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:17.660]  me is they're maybe not as dialed in as others you know what you think bro yeah
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:21.660]  well I was gonna say I think there's talent you know so just just because
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:26.140]  people are using IMO that doesn't mean that they're gonna get anywhere it's
[01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:30.580]  that you're creating your IMO and on your level and you said you know winning
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:34.140]  a belt when you were younger well maybe that wouldn't have happened for you
[01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:39.820]  because it took you know basically a lifetime for you to put all this stuff
[01:36:39.820 --> 01:36:46.780]  together and that and now you're literally reaping the the fruits of your
[01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:54.340]  labor and having other people that don't know you for from Adam finding
[01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:58.420]  your stuff to be enjoyable enough where it's like all right this guy wins not
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:02.380]  only a state but wins the national championship and now that this is
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:07.380]  hopefully gonna become something man to be the second year this is just fun for
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:11.740]  me man I mean it's just fun to see your friends find success and I hope more
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:16.420]  people live their life that way there's enough for everybody and you can find
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:20.740]  success in your own little ways and if you can't grow you know you could start
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:24.540]  building like I said that there's nothing illegal about starting your own
[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:28.740]  worm farm so that you know hey in two years when I got enough money to get my
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:32.180]  own spot or however you're thinking about that these are chess moves and
[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:36.340]  that's why I brought up Marco on the on the picnic table that Sunday like he's
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:40.940]  already in you know he had he had his moment I sucks that I didn't win
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:47.180]  whatever and now I'm back on to grind mode and maybe that's not something
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:50.660]  necessarily that everybody's got so I mean there's a lot of attributes I think
[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:55.860]  that you just have ingrained in you and just being maybe just who you are as a
[01:37:55.860 --> 01:38:02.860]  human being so that more people can find success putting mother nature first and
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:07.260]  then putting in the work ethic and I think that's that's part of where you're
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:10.700]  just shining is that you're putting in the work each and every day you're
[01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:15.300]  Instagram is proof of that because you're just showing what you do I think
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:18.620]  more people are gonna be going back to probably the early parts of your
[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:23.740]  Instagram days and checking out like some of that others other videos and
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:28.060]  some of those early fire kind of like viral things for cannabis I remember
[01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:31.580]  some of your videos were like couple thousand views which is huge for when
[01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:35.140]  you're getting what they call that shadow band and all that kind of stuff
[01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:39.340]  so I know they shut that down I know they've been slowing down Peters
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:47.700]  channel yeah damn shame yeah that's part of it man dealing with that stuff
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:56.340]  but um yeah so man it was um definitely a fun experience definitely and that's
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:59.780]  all I wanted to say like on a stage I'd be like this one's for the natural
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:07.780]  farmer this was for this was for us like so so now like you know like don't I
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:11.420]  don't want to hear about your bottles for sure now I already don't want to
[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:16.700]  hear about them but now how can you tell me about some bottles I got I'm not here
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:21.820]  using rabbit poop growing winning cannabis like look at its little shit
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:28.460]  it's just the small stuff black soldier flies the roly-poly's I supply soil
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:33.060]  shredders you know I mean all that that's all this growing this cannabis
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:37.940]  you know and this soil I was a little bit nervous because this was all wasn't
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:43.300]  it was only like on the fifth it was cycle five when I grew it and I was like
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:47.180]  yeah so I was young but she's a she was she was pumping you know the soil was
[01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:53.540]  very I did well with the soil I like what the soil did to help me you know
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:59.100]  what I mean just in a three by three I love seeing that people are now seeing
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:03.740]  soil as valuable you know when we were doing commercial grows and we were
[01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:07.740]  buying the Fox farm stuff trying to tell the you know the suits why are we doing
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:12.540]  this I mean it felt like a mild on this main hallway right and we would just see
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:15.820]  rows and rows of this stuff and there would be we would have to pay money to
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:20.540]  throw it away at the end of it so Colorado was was backwards on a lot of
[01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:26.700]  this thinking even it's so-called some of these organic farms it's just a
[01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:32.100]  night-day difference man when you're reusing things and improving on that and
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:36.580]  then taking it to the next level with using the life and you'd mentioned like
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:43.460]  that four-inch sweet spot if you will I think that is where a lot of the
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:48.020]  skeptics find that aha moment is when you peel that back for the first time
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:51.140]  and you see that life running through there where you might not even
[01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:54.700]  understand everything that's that you're looking at but you realize hey I don't
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:57.820]  have fungus that's all of a sudden I got those real beetles running through
[01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:03.220]  there I have the skid amiss hyperelse smiles what you know the beneficial
[01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:09.580]  mites in there you're running a lot of the the proactive stuff and I'm proud to
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:13.060]  say that I think you're gonna be carrying that torch man and more
[01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:18.100]  individuals will hopefully jump into the pool now that they see that you can find
[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:23.740]  success doing this and it's as simple as that easy money man low low cost like
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:30.820]  right now there's people like scram like and listen I grow easy like it's I
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:35.980]  don't I'm not in there like hustling and bustling like my grows pretty much run
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:42.180]  you know what I mean you know other I've heard other people say that as well like
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:45.580]  and it's true like once things start rolling you know you can kind of just
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:50.500]  check check on it every day or every other day once the grow gets going you
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:56.340]  got pests under control soils good water and deep because soil can now hold
[01:41:56.340 --> 01:42:02.500]  several days of water you know I mean few things I did do with this I did um
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:10.340]  two days of dark and 48 hours of dark on this when I did this and I did um I just
[01:42:10.340 --> 01:42:16.900]  saw a drought stress at the end so I didn't water for I think it went to 12
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:24.100]  days I didn't water the 3x3 bed at the end and let it kind of just go right on
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:26.420]  out you know I mean just drive right on out
[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:30.500]  soil still was good though plant didn't like wilt or anything when it was time
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:35.300]  to chop she was still ready but I could feel I just felt like turps and all was
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:40.980]  increased another thing um and we say this a lot you know again organic
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:47.300]  fertilizers late in flower will diminish your THC and your turps and and
[01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:51.940]  so don't go heavy with your feed you know like I pretty much went water only
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:56.260]  you know I mean I wasn't even going aggressive like I sometimes I feed real
[01:42:56.260 --> 01:43:01.740]  hard and heavy and run my light super hot you know I just was kind of just let
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:07.060]  this kind of go that just kind of be a net grow go as natural as possible and
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:14.660]  and um and then she did her thing bro like I was surprised to me like I knew
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:20.300]  she was strong but you know 27 on the on the THC's and it's high you know I mean
[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:25.420]  that's good and then the turps numbers was fucking was what I really love and
[01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:28.980]  then for that for my man to even be higher you know I'm saying so shit
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:34.460]  respect to him too you know I mean they did say it was really close on the lab
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:40.820]  results so you know hey man I love that too yeah man maybe this is like a little
[01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:46.460]  friendly rivalry now you know I'd be interesting to know if he entered last
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:51.020]  year as well yeah that's a good question I have to try to get up get in touch
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:54.620]  with him up especially knowing that he's you know running that thing natural I
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:58.500]  was like that's the only way she ain't gonna tell me salt came up there and
[01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:04.500]  jumped on me on chirps and THC so I'm glad that I'm glad that is the case
[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:11.340]  because that'll been hard to believe see more yeah more people up to the
[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:16.140]  challenge and stuff you know like people kind of like dismiss things like you'd
[01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:20.020]  even mention the horizontal soil somebody who's even like look up to was
[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:25.340]  was poopoo and that so we tried to have them come on and debate latent about it
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:27.940]  and then all of a sudden you know that person doesn't want to do that kind of
[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:32.260]  stuff so I think sometimes when you're getting your information even from
[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:36.740]  people that supposedly are in the industry maybe they feel a certain way
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:40.380]  you know if you're using that setup you're not going to be buying their soil
[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:46.300]  anymore so that might be a hidden little agenda so you got to focus on yourself
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:51.760]  your grow and realize that the people that are out here giving stuff away for
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:56.620]  free sometimes are given the real gems and Marco was one of them and there are
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:45:00.180]  other people out there with podcasts that I like to listen to man but from my
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:05.180]  cannabis standpoint I'm proud to do this with you each and every week and I hope
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:08.800]  that others see that soil systems don't even believe you missed the boat on
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:13.700]  cannabis you know there's other ways to monetize things for yourself and become
[01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:19.220]  an entrepreneur and I just well probably for the rest of my life shout that out
[01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:26.180]  and hope that more people realize that we can make we can make a lifetime
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:31.020]  decision with finding high-end soil systems and finding ways to monetize
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:36.060]  that for yourself exactly we're just having fun man rocking the belts all day
[01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:40.700]  like this I mean you know I'm proud of the belts we're just letting y'all know
[01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:45.060]  that um you know how we do man I feel like like I said like you said receipts
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:50.740]  you know what I mean this is just kind of receipts that um but you know this
[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:55.500]  this I don't know no it just feels good man because it's like numb now no matter
[01:45:55.500 --> 01:46:00.260]  what you know you know you can't really hate on it all what we doing here you
[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:05.980]  know you can't hate on it because we're coming in and um and winning man you
[01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:09.420]  know what I mean with the natural way like doing this all the stuff we talked
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:17.020]  about cheap stuff low cost it works you know so and give it away for free baby
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:22.900]  yeah and don't mind giving it away for free because like it's crazy like how
[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:28.220]  life is it's like wow damn that's like yeah I'm giving this shit away for free
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:35.940]  then also go in there and get a little W you know I'm saying so like it's kind
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:42.820]  of like all right free works and I always say that I always say like um you
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:47.660]  know first you do good and then and then you do well and they're doing good is
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:50.820]  when you're helping people and they're doing well is when you start getting it
[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:57.860]  and I've heard I watched um I forgot or I think I read it was um all you know
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:03.140]  like black billionaires like different wealthy you know they all said that they
[01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:07.820]  were all like a lot of more like first I just focused on doing good and doing
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:13.020]  good was for whatever industry were doing good teaching somebody something
[01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:18.980]  growing something feeding somebody the doing well comes it's gonna come it has
[01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:23.660]  to come because we say it in the soil good and bad are the same when things
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:28.260]  are in balance so if you have lived a life and your life was and I got kicked
[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:32.420]  in the ass kicked in the ass kicked in there you gotta stick with it because
[01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:37.220]  eventually that goods gonna come right but if you keep getting kicked in the
[01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:42.220]  ass and you just let and you say I'll fuck it I might as well just say fuck it
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:47.500]  well you could easily go to a side where you can't come back where your goods
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:51.260]  never gonna come back you know I look at shit like that like your goods gonna
[01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:57.700]  come to you it don't have to though like life don't you could die tomorrow like
[01:47:57.700 --> 01:48:02.540]  you don't have to get the good but when things are in balance you live in a good
[01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:07.300]  life things you're healthy eventually that goods gonna come man and it just
[01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:12.460]  takes time you know but like I said earlier I thought about my own life and
[01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:17.860]  I always was trying to be obviously I was trying to be well above average but
[01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:21.620]  I always was trying to be on that other side of the line trying to be better
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:26.620]  than better than worse you know I'm saying and if I took L's man I took very
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:33.420]  few L's well when we take L's man you gotta come back with that W you know I
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:38.100]  feel like I took a L when I had my friends fly out there last year and so
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:42.100]  in my mind I said I'm gonna do whatever I gotta do to win this thing you know I
[01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:47.140]  mean and I did so there's a lot of pressure on me too because I push it out
[01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:51.380]  there you know I let people know I'm in this competition I am in there I do I
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:55.300]  grew this you know I put into me when you put your shit out there and hold
[01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:59.620]  yourself accountable it's easy to just sit in the room I'm not doing this show
[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:05.500]  I don't know nobody on Instagram I could just be mediocre grow me some mediocre
[01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:10.900]  weed you know I mean gross and bullshit nobody knows right put yourself out
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:14.580]  there hold yourself accountable a little bit more you know you have that
[01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:18.020]  pride where I'm like hey man I'm showing everybody I'm doing this I'm entering
[01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:24.860]  this I don't know I'm a win but I hope I do you know and then when you when you
[01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:30.620]  get that W man it just it just feels good yeah it makes you think of that
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:34.740]  Kanye when he was up there and they're like everybody's asking me what they
[01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:38.420]  were what I was gonna say if I didn't win and then he's like pause and he said
[01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:44.820]  I guess we'll never know you know exactly exactly I think you know there's
[01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:49.300]  nothing wrong with the setting a goal achieving it I think that's why even
[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:52.660]  there's parades with sports and shit I mean there's there's something to
[01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:56.060]  achieving it as well and then kind of just getting back to work you know you
[01:49:56.060 --> 01:50:00.500]  don't three months from now I know you're cutting your character man you're
[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:04.220]  not gonna be like those bills would probably just somewhere in the house
[01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:08.500]  right but moving forward and that kind of thing and always kind of like having
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:12.900]  a perpetual harvest having a perpetual life where you've got these chess moves
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:17.660]  in the works and you're finding you know you're bobbing and weaving and then when
[01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:23.860]  it pays off man there's nothing wrong with enjoying that yeah yeah I love um
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:27.980]  yeah hope so you hope some good I know some good things will come from I haven't
[01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:32.580]  like sat in there and try to be strategic like okay now I'm you know I
[01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:37.980]  do such-and-such award-winning this or that you know like I'm not on that kind
[01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:42.700]  of shit but I just want good to come from it in the sense of hopefully
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:47.340]  somebody I can touch somebody or see somebody or somebody will see me or and
[01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:52.900]  and it may be maybe lead to a little bit more you know opportunity or or just
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:56.620]  being able to get out there more because I just would love to help more you know
[01:50:56.620 --> 01:51:02.220]  help people more you know to me like and Instagram's cool but I really like
[01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:06.060]  that you know interact and trying to interact with people on a in-person
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:11.860]  level you know it's cool so we got a homegirl RVA asked me to come out on
[01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:19.780]  June 3rd Saturday June 3rd just talk and I'm just gonna go through this is before
[01:51:19.780 --> 01:51:25.900]  I actually won and I was just gonna go through and um talk about my process for
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:30.420]  how I grow cannabis from building my soil collecting the ingredients and all
[01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:35.420]  the way up to the end and then now I can add on to the end of it like fuck you
[01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:42.180]  know it works and by the way it works like you know we can we can get a W here
[01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:46.900]  using these methods that are very low cost and I think respect to them because
[01:51:46.900 --> 01:51:51.820]  he knows me and he knows he owns a hydro shop and yeah and I've spoken there
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:55.820]  before but the main I'll tell you right there at this um when I'm doing my
[01:51:55.820 --> 01:52:00.420]  presentation I'm here to keep you out of this store like this like I told him
[01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:05.300]  that last time and everybody laughed and in this sense I am but when you're
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:08.780]  building your soils when you're starting out when you're getting going getting
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:13.160]  your equipment the store is a valuable place you know what I mean and you got
[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:18.340]  to get in there and possibly um you know buy some things buy some amendments and
[01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:23.280]  that's cool but but but the key is you don't want to be going there every every
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:29.920]  month you know every every few weeks to buy stuff right now my biggest expense
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:35.040]  is just IPM you know for some reason every month I've noticed like every
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:39.200]  month I'm starting to get spider mites I feel like I'm not quite getting them all
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:44.400]  the way out for some weird reason I've been a little lacking on some of my IPM
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:51.720]  you know it is what it is but so yeah I really just want to um I got to get that
[01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:54.840]  dialed in they haven't been like where they're you know getting out of control
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:58.520]  but what it is like right at the end the flower right before I'm buried in
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:01.520]  harvest I'll start seeing the white little speckling on some of the leaves
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:09.920]  telling me they're still around and to grow just a low but you know something
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:14.080]  to just deal with so I mean just some I deal with you know I've been buying a
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:18.600]  fucking hundred dollars worth of you know predatory mites every month but
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:23.360]  because I'm so low cost on everything else I'm not tripping on that I'm like
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:27.920]  okay man it's costing me you know 100 bucks right now till I really get this
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:33.200]  dialed in it's not the end of the world
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:38.000]  now that's that's super low cost man I remember when we were running like
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:45.200]  advanced nutrients and house and garden you're talking like 2500 3k and the money
[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:51.040]  was there because the pounds were still priced at a certain point but that's
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:54.640]  like there anymore and obviously the future is that the prices aren't gonna
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:59.720]  go up unless it's high high quality so how do you get there if this is you
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:03.960]  know you're peering over the Niagara Falls if you will of wanting to do this
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:07.880]  and you're leaning down thinking if this is something that you can do I hope that
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:12.560]  you realize after today that the microbial world's got your back and so
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:16.280]  even managing like pest issues just knowing that it's gonna be there being
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:21.240]  proactive you're going to find a lot more success than a lot of individuals
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:25.360]  the first started out yeah no I'm still here
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:31.080]  divine I saw some people were asking Marco talked pretty in-depth about the
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:36.120]  the genetics so just kind of rewind and watch the show from the beginning I saw
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:40.560]  some people wanted to know more about it it's a belief strain that he grew from
[01:54:40.560 --> 01:54:45.160]  seed yeah any other little things you want to maybe a tidbit you didn't add on
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:51.200]  that I saw a couple people asking and this is just popped up um let's get back
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:55:01.720]  over here hang on a second um yeah um it's um belief collab with in-house I
[01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:06.840]  feel like some of his in-house collabs are like super super strong you know
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:14.200]  good good collabs so um yeah white truffle combined combined with divinity
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:21.680]  35 and it came out of b-leafs divine truffle yeah I got a gift pack of seeds
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:29.080]  from so he's always showing love man and his stuff is like it's really great all
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:34.120]  looks wonderful and then then then in between that you find some really heavy
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:42.960]  in there you know so I my cut was or my strains you know it was very piney and I
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:47.120]  wanted to kind of give it my own little name in the sake of this competition and
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:51.480]  you know time I put into finding it and stuff so I ended up calling it divine
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:58.080]  pine due to kind of the smell and kind of thrown back to the original name but
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:07.120]  um yeah you know very very um very strong man you know very strong plant
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:17.480]  very nice medicinal uplifting you know high and yeah just wonderful super
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:21.600]  strong super loud I'm not wonderful talking about you know kind of
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:26.360]  describing the flavors but you get that pine in there it finishes off for like a
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:30.760]  little light grape at the end kind of just like a like a minty grape like I
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:37.200]  kind of pops a little bit and definitely flavorful even for flower
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:41.320]  like because you know I've been on my dry sift deal lately working at working
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:47.880]  that out which is so tasty but um yeah even for a flower man very tasty like
[01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:55.360]  you know in a burn she checks all the boxes I ended up plant size about two
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:57:00.600]  ounces not badging long you know I'm saying badging within that six plant in
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:09.520]  the three by three bed but the rooms five by four canopy space and so yeah
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:20.000]  like um you know sweet plant man I mean just special I got the cut I still have
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:27.560]  the cut and I have probably about 200 seeds that came out of the winning plant
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:32.540]  so I'm gonna work through those seeds to here eventually while I'm working so I'm
[01:57:32.540 --> 01:57:37.200]  kind of thinking about doing the King J Fantasia on one side and then just keep
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:43.000]  hitting these divine pines and see if I can find some more heat out of there but
[01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:48.520]  she's so solid on her own man I may just leave let the seeds ride going back to
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:53.000]  them later and just you know keep work this just keep growing her because she's
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.820]  a beautiful plant and I really haven't I want to grow a whole room of it so I got
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:02.680]  you know plenty to share with you know friends and family and all that stuff
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:08.560]  where man there's no need to make this a really long episode I think a lot of
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:13.120]  people are gonna enjoy probably that it's a little bit shorter is there
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:19.080]  anything you kind of wanted to add or you know if I let's roleplay a little
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:23.560]  bit like about if I'm 23 years old and I'm thinking about this is my future you
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:28.960]  know what would you kind of say to an individual that's thinking in that way
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:36.320]  that's a great question man the biggest thing man I would tell people is like I
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:42.360]  was saying earlier get picky young at an early age you know get picky and that
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:47.200]  and it might be kind of hard to visualize what I'm saying but like I say
[01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:52.560]  tough love get rid of that stuff that ain't quite what you want and move on
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:55.880]  and find something that is what you want you know and that goes for everything
[01:58:55.880 --> 01:59:00.960]  man like even relationships man I see a lot of young folks you get but you get
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:07.720]  bogged down in relationships and wasting time there my thing is time like as I
[01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:12.120]  get older you know time is what you need more of because to find good
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:17.040]  strains it takes time so start young get focused on something young find it
[01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:22.400]  you know qualities you like in cannabis now you can get seeds and genetics
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:27.600]  there's so well worked out if you can just jump right in and start you know
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:32.840]  like you know finding things you know finding good quality but look for exotic
[01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:36.920]  turps different things if you find something really different try to keep
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:40.440]  it as long as you can I used to always be terrible about keeping stuff real
[01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:45.800]  long because you kind of get bored with it but if you get something really nice
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:49.920]  man keep it as long as you can share it with people so try to let them keep it
[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:54.400]  you know what I mean and just far as growing just keep doing what we talk
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:57.440]  about all the time on the show you know I mean that natural farm and that
[01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:03.440]  microbial diversity that IMO you know you got to have all that stuff in there
[02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:08.480]  but see the key that you get you can't forget is got a top dress that mulch
[02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:13.040]  every cycle because that's where all your nutrient cycling happens you know
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:16.680]  when you start getting a soil that gets old if you dig down in it it's pretty
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:23.800]  much it was just kind of like look looks almost like kind of PD like kind of how
[02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:27.680]  Pete looks you know it kind of gets to kind of that texture to it and all
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:33.440]  spongy and so you don't see is the amount of life you do in the soil as you
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:40.110]  do right on the top in my opinion that's key but yeah man I don't want to
[02:00:40.110 --> 02:00:43.430]  stretch it out either I appreciate it man I thank everybody for showing a love
[02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:48.830]  man I'm glad we got to do a little belt show and stuff and now you know like
[02:00:48.830 --> 02:00:54.390]  you're right the belts I'll put them up and and and and figure out what I was
[02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:59.150]  telling Nikki I'm figure out my next little mission I want to be on and then
[02:00:59.150 --> 02:01:03.150]  we'll put the belts up and then just keep doing what we're doing man and
[02:01:03.150 --> 02:01:07.830]  that's just growing you know growing this good quality cannabis for the low
[02:01:07.830 --> 02:01:12.230]  cost and I would like to see other people jump out there and and you know
[02:01:12.230 --> 02:01:16.590]  enter some competitions and things like that it's all good it's all fun man you
[02:01:16.590 --> 02:01:21.030]  know what I mean you get to meet people and shit you might surprise yourself and
[02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:26.630]  win like you know after losing last year hey man you never know you get a little
[02:01:26.630 --> 02:01:32.510]  bit of self-doubt in there you're like fire but then you break it down you
[02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:36.390]  realize you know hey man that wasn't a terpid very terpy strain you entered you
[02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:41.550]  entered what you had and then once you put focus to it and then now you put
[02:01:41.550 --> 02:01:47.550]  intent we always talk about that intent when I put intentions for years worth of
[02:01:47.550 --> 02:01:53.270]  my intentions to win in this thing you know that that was effort and that
[02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:59.950]  effort you know didn't go unnoticed so thankfully we had some seasoned smokers
[02:01:59.950 --> 02:02:04.390]  and they were able to appreciate it man thanks to be leaf and those guys for
[02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:09.550]  putting up putting a nice package of genetics together that a grower like me
[02:02:09.550 --> 02:02:13.230]  could go in there and just you know pick something out and find something good I
[02:02:13.230 --> 02:02:18.550]  didn't I didn't pick a thousand plants think about it I he gave me I think I
[02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:23.790]  got 20 seeds I think I popped about 10 and actually found the winning strain
[02:02:23.790 --> 02:02:30.110]  for this you know this cup and a 10-pack you know I mean so sometimes
[02:02:30.110 --> 02:02:36.150]  you get lucky like that right you know I'm not saying it's a Willie Wonka
[02:02:36.150 --> 02:02:40.470]  chocolate you know go in and bar but you know what I'm saying going in ticket but
[02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:45.950]  man that's a hell of a way to come out of a 10-pack and using the growing
[02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:51.630]  techniques of shit that I've been using forever well in a way man it kind of
[02:02:51.630 --> 02:02:55.430]  validates belief because he's been doing this for a minute now we've had
[02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:58.990]  him on the show a couple times he's talking about his I believe it's like a
[02:02:58.990 --> 02:03:03.230]  hundred point inspection thing and he kind of you know he's not gonna tell us
[02:03:03.230 --> 02:03:07.790]  all but if you guys check out that episode he he briefly kind of goes over
[02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:13.670]  what's his thought process is on that and then behind the scenes individuals
[02:03:13.670 --> 02:03:17.710]  in Oklahoma have kind of made a name for themselves or started to make a name for
[02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:23.030]  themselves with with his genetics and now that you've kind of put that up on
[02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:28.310]  the national stage there's something to man when you're able to find to me man
[02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:31.710]  he's kind of like maybe like a Pharrell or something it seems like he's got a
[02:03:31.710 --> 02:03:36.550]  lot of hits so if you partner up with that collab you might be able to find
[02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:40.470]  something special and that's I think what more people want to see man is that
[02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:46.950]  if I'm spending money on genetics do I have the potential to find that lottery
[02:03:46.990 --> 02:03:51.430]  ticket and once more beginners realize that that's kind of the way you got to
[02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:56.190]  look at it like a ten pack is a lottery ticket a hundred packing for some is a
[02:03:56.190 --> 02:04:02.190]  lottery ticket a thousand pack is a lottery ticket but hopefully with with
[02:04:02.190 --> 02:04:06.790]  like belief or maybe some of the other seems now especially tried and true
[02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:12.310]  breeders maybe you only need 25 C's to find something for your little local
[02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:18.030]  area now you got something special you know nobody else has it most people
[02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:20.870]  probably aren't watching this show in your little local area so you got
[02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:26.030]  something super special that nobody can rip off you get to probably call it
[02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:31.390]  whatever you want and run with it mm-hmm that's right yeah you know name it what
[02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:37.110]  you want you paid for but I like to give a little bit of homage back like to the
[02:04:37.110 --> 02:04:40.830]  original it didn't have a truffle smell so I didn't want to be throwing the
[02:04:40.830 --> 02:04:45.870]  truffle in there so that's how we ended up there but yeah man that's um fun
[02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:51.510]  stuff and look I say the same thing I said if I I didn't grow as differently
[02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:55.030]  because it was for like I didn't say all right this is for a cup I'm doing this
[02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:57.830]  differently the only thing that was different was my intentions my
[02:04:57.830 --> 02:05:02.470]  intentions were now to grow to win you know it wasn't like now I did something
[02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:08.790]  different to win but my mindset and intention was who's gonna win which one
[02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:12.070]  of you girls is gonna win when I'm talking to my garden I'm looking in
[02:05:12.070 --> 02:05:18.510]  there and I'm working on it who's gonna get this W who wants it and and I got a
[02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:24.270]  little bit of a chill bump just saying that just now but the plants talk to you
[02:05:24.270 --> 02:05:31.190]  they told me who to put in the contest and then they told the judges who they
[02:05:31.190 --> 02:05:34.670]  wanted to win you know like that's all communication you know what I mean it's
[02:05:34.670 --> 02:05:39.030]  the plant telling somebody do something and so when you get a wonderful plant
[02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:46.590]  like that you know you get that love so no I think I think we pretty much said
[02:05:46.590 --> 02:05:51.790]  it all I think everybody kind of kind of feels where we're coming from natural
[02:05:51.790 --> 02:05:57.870]  farming we can get rid of turps get them W's man yeah I mean you know
[02:05:57.870 --> 02:06:01.910]  unfortunately a lot of people lie about the turps there's some fishtail type
[02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:06.710]  stories all the time but here you have somebody in a competition THC
[02:06:06.710 --> 02:06:10.990]  percentages that's that's through the roof man to be honest I mean most people
[02:06:10.990 --> 02:06:15.910]  lie about that shit but then also to have the turps there as well and to have
[02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:19.390]  a third party I think that more people will realize that what we've been saying
[02:06:19.390 --> 02:06:25.070]  is it's it really is kind of basic stuff Marco and then you try to find how you
[02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:30.630]  can be elite and creating all of these different self-made amendments because
[02:06:30.630 --> 02:06:37.910]  that's for me man that's probably what would really define your divine pine is
[02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:41.830]  that you've made all this shit yourself so how would somebody be able like if
[02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:47.470]  I'm running whatever products or salts and you're running these salts it's like
[02:06:47.470 --> 02:06:51.670]  man if I a little bit of a better grower than you basically you know and for the
[02:06:51.670 --> 02:06:55.790]  most part it probably smells a certain way and that's just hard to get out of
[02:06:55.790 --> 02:07:00.550]  even if you're if you're a skilled salt grower I mean there's people out there
[02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:06.550]  that crush it absolutely but the average individual doesn't and that's you know
[02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:09.990]  that's the truth of this part yeah I think that more people are starting to
[02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:18.310]  realize that and see that yeah well yeah we appreciate you guys you know it took
[02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:22.590]  two weeks to get this show on the road especially to have all the hardware we
[02:07:22.590 --> 02:07:28.110]  wanted to make sure we were showing that off again man Marco it's just a blessing
[02:07:28.110 --> 02:07:32.830]  man to see you shine and I'm glad that hard work pays off and more people will
[02:07:32.830 --> 02:07:37.150]  see that behind the scenes I know that you're constantly working on your grind
[02:07:37.150 --> 02:07:42.470]  and I don't think most people understand what it actually takes the real work
[02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:47.550]  ethic it takes to be successful in life and so those belts represent that man
[02:07:47.550 --> 02:07:53.430]  and you know cool to see you win boy yeah thank you bro appreciate you all
[02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:57.310]  right everybody appreciate y'all for joining us again
