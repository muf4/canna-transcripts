[00:30.590 --> 00:36.710]  Okay, here we go again for another week on the SIFT.
[00:36.710 --> 00:42.170]  We're gonna go deep today, so everybody's got to have their thinking cap on.
[00:42.170 --> 00:47.610]  And I hope we don't lose anybody, but we're gonna take questions at the end.
[00:47.610 --> 00:54.690]  I want you to meet my Swiss friend, Philippe, who everybody knows the good stuff comes from
[00:54.690 --> 00:55.690]  Switzerland, right?
[00:55.690 --> 00:56.690]  How are you, Philippe?
[00:56.690 --> 00:57.690]  Hey, Ron.
[00:57.690 --> 00:58.690]  Yeah, right here.
[00:58.690 --> 00:59.690]  Hey, Ron.
[00:59.690 --> 01:01.730]  Yeah, right on, man.
[01:01.730 --> 01:02.730]  Doing really well.
[01:02.730 --> 01:03.730]  Thank you.
[01:03.730 --> 01:05.050]  Yeah, what a wonderful time of year.
[01:05.050 --> 01:06.050]  Yeah.
[01:06.050 --> 01:13.350]  Well, hey, tell us a little bit about yourself and maybe about the pikas or pikas, whatever
[01:13.350 --> 01:18.130]  you want to call them, and tell us a little bit about yourself.
[01:18.130 --> 01:19.130]  Absolutely.
[01:19.130 --> 01:22.490]  Where do I begin?
[01:22.490 --> 01:24.810]  In one month, I'm turning 40 years old.
[01:24.810 --> 01:33.530]  So just to kind of place my journey in terms of timelines, I was born in Switzerland.
[01:33.530 --> 01:36.810]  And very early on, I moved to Africa with my parents.
[01:36.810 --> 01:41.170]  I lived in Mali as a baby and child.
[01:41.170 --> 01:45.290]  Happened to be the only white guy within a thousand kilometer radius in the middle of
[01:45.290 --> 01:49.650]  kind of the Sahel, just the south side of the Sahara Desert.
[01:49.650 --> 01:54.290]  So this is where I essentially grew up, even though I'm born in Switzerland and Swiss by
[01:54.290 --> 01:56.530]  nationality.
[01:56.530 --> 01:59.490]  My parents are actually visiting, and they mentioned to me a story of when I was four
[01:59.490 --> 02:04.410]  years old, when we returned to Switzerland for the first time, how I just wasn't taking
[02:04.410 --> 02:05.410]  it.
[02:05.410 --> 02:07.010]  I just was not happy with all this greenery.
[02:07.010 --> 02:11.330]  I was used to sand dunes, you know.
[02:11.330 --> 02:14.930]  And yeah, I just did not, I was not pleased in any case.
[02:14.930 --> 02:20.610]  But I definitely grew to love, you know, the coniferous forests and the smells.
[02:20.610 --> 02:26.010]  And later on in my life, when I lived in southern Africa, one of the great things I missed was
[02:26.010 --> 02:31.250]  always the smell of the pine forests and kind of a temperate, after having lived in tropical
[02:31.250 --> 02:35.490]  regions where it was one or two seasons, always missing that kind of temperate.
[02:35.490 --> 02:41.170]  And, you know, I ended up finding out later on that that was mainly mediated by terpenes,
[02:41.170 --> 02:44.290]  alpha and beta pinene in particular.
[02:44.290 --> 02:48.570]  So really interesting how, you know, these smells kind of bring you back to what you
[02:48.570 --> 02:53.890]  think is home or what you found out when you're four years old was home.
[02:53.890 --> 02:57.970]  You'd assume there was a totally alien landscape, much more mineral.
[02:57.970 --> 03:04.330]  But in any case, that, I guess, sprung my passion for life and biology.
[03:04.330 --> 03:08.810]  And I went to high school.
[03:08.810 --> 03:13.090]  We lived in southern Africa at that time, went to high school in the kingdom of Swaziland,
[03:13.090 --> 03:17.490]  which has a different name now, but back then it was Swazi.
[03:17.490 --> 03:22.770]  And obviously, there's a few interesting things going on down there, including the Swazi gold
[03:22.770 --> 03:28.090]  and the culture of growing cannabis outdoors in the mountains and realizing that the wheat
[03:28.090 --> 03:32.570]  from the mountains versus the wheat from the sea was, you know, a much more potent and
[03:32.570 --> 03:37.310]  also different, very different way.
[03:37.310 --> 03:41.970]  When you don't have the hot temperatures of the equator and the beaches, you're actually
[03:41.970 --> 03:47.210]  able to cure cannabis or any plant for that matter in a different fashion.
[03:47.210 --> 03:49.570]  So again, retaining the terpenes.
[03:49.570 --> 03:57.490]  So all along, you know, from a pretty young age, about 12 years old, I discovered cannabis
[03:57.490 --> 04:04.530]  in Africa and in very earnest fashion, hashish, some kind of, you know, dried up banana type.
[04:04.530 --> 04:05.530]  Malawi.
[04:05.530 --> 04:07.530]  Yeah, the Malawi cured, yeah.
[04:07.530 --> 04:08.530]  Exactly.
[04:08.530 --> 04:11.090]  So that's the, you know, southern African style.
[04:11.210 --> 04:15.170]  And then, you know, discovering the Swazi and then eventually going back to Switzerland,
[04:15.170 --> 04:20.610]  discovering like, OK, there's indoor, there's proper curing where you actually have a green
[04:20.610 --> 04:27.410]  bud that, you know, essentially retains all the flavors and the structure as well of the
[04:27.410 --> 04:32.330]  plant and obviously creates a different feel and different culture of smoking it.
[04:32.330 --> 04:37.730]  And, you know, in Switzerland, it's mixed with tobacco too.
[04:37.730 --> 04:43.050]  So it's yet another level of, OK, how can you incorporate, you know, alkaloids and terpenes
[04:43.050 --> 04:47.850]  and cannabinoids and all these things together to create a very different experience.
[04:47.850 --> 04:51.370]  But back then, obviously, studying cannabis wasn't really an option.
[04:51.370 --> 04:57.170]  So I went to grad school in my hometown or I went to university and then grad school
[04:57.170 --> 05:02.890]  in my hometown of Lausanne in Switzerland and ended up studying genetics.
[05:02.930 --> 05:07.810]  Where I got into genetics, population genetics in particular.
[05:07.810 --> 05:11.210]  And I was studying because I couldn't study weed.
[05:11.210 --> 05:15.330]  I studied invasive plants, which are also called weeds.
[05:15.330 --> 05:20.610]  So kind of inside of my humoristic self, I decided this was the next best thing.
[05:20.610 --> 05:28.010]  So I kind of leveraged that possibility to experience, you know, how to track plants
[05:28.050 --> 05:32.570]  across the world, how to study their genomes to find out, you know, why is this plant giant
[05:32.570 --> 05:36.250]  versus a congener being much smaller?
[05:36.250 --> 05:42.650]  You know, how do genes influence the way that things grow and become or develop certain
[05:42.650 --> 05:45.330]  traits of interest, regardless of what it was?
[05:45.330 --> 05:47.330]  Back then, it was, you know, where did it come from?
[05:47.330 --> 05:49.130]  How can we best eradicate them?
[05:49.130 --> 05:54.850]  So it came from a very negative and looking at the alien species as a problem, as opposed
[05:54.850 --> 05:58.850]  to, you know, once you kind of are able to integrate that, you can see a bigger picture
[05:58.850 --> 06:05.970]  that I believe I over the years I've come to understand.
[06:05.970 --> 06:11.290]  But after grad school in Switzerland, there was really very little opportunity, I guess.
[06:11.290 --> 06:16.250]  I did a master's degree in Europe in 2007.
[06:16.250 --> 06:19.730]  You know, the only options was just unpaid internships and things like that.
[06:19.730 --> 06:20.730]  I just wasn't interested.
[06:20.730 --> 06:25.930]  And I said, you know what, I would love to travel across, you know, and go to another
[06:25.930 --> 06:28.450]  place that has these beautiful forests.
[06:28.450 --> 06:32.490]  And British Columbia was always a place that had come up.
[06:32.490 --> 06:41.330]  So I moved here in 2007 to Colonna, BC to do a PhD on the picas that Ron just mentioned.
[06:41.330 --> 06:46.890]  Picas are a small animal, a small rabbit, a rabbit family that live in the Alpines.
[06:46.890 --> 06:49.570]  I've always also enjoyed the Alpines.
[06:49.570 --> 06:55.210]  And that was kind of my thing was come here and study how these little animals are affected
[06:55.210 --> 06:59.210]  by climate change by looking by using these genetic techniques.
[06:59.210 --> 07:03.330]  So it was moving more from genetics to now genomics.
[07:03.330 --> 07:10.650]  And so I moved to Colonna, did a thesis, spent a lot of time in the Bella Coola region, because
[07:10.650 --> 07:14.690]  there's a natural gradient of elevation where these animals actually inhabit all the way
[07:14.730 --> 07:18.650]  from sea level to the mountaintops, all the ecosystems.
[07:18.650 --> 07:23.530]  And so it's a great place to see, you know, the environment changes a lot along that gradient.
[07:23.530 --> 07:30.570]  We could use that as a model, call it, to study and understand how species can respond
[07:30.570 --> 07:35.430]  to changes in environmental conditions, be them human caused or not.
[07:35.430 --> 07:41.810]  So that introduced me to genomics, especially looking at selection.
[07:41.810 --> 07:46.250]  And then the genetic tools to do that.
[07:46.250 --> 07:54.570]  I then finished my thesis in 2011, became a Canadian permanent resident at that point
[07:54.570 --> 07:56.170]  in time.
[07:56.170 --> 08:03.690]  And also because I had started a family here with my partner, Alison.
[08:03.690 --> 08:06.890]  And we, yeah, we ended up moving around.
[08:06.890 --> 08:07.890]  We went to Calgary.
[08:08.570 --> 08:12.730]  We actually worked in Jasper a lot of the time.
[08:12.730 --> 08:18.610]  We lived in Cochrane, which is a nice little city outside, closer to the mountains.
[08:18.610 --> 08:19.850]  So yeah, great time there.
[08:19.850 --> 08:21.930]  Postdoc was the main focus of the work.
[08:21.930 --> 08:27.290]  So still leveraging, you know, genomic, genetic tools to study white-tailed deer, grizzly
[08:27.290 --> 08:32.890]  bears, and, you know, essentially a lot of projects with Parks Canada.
[08:32.890 --> 08:35.650]  So then I moved to UNBC in Prince George.
[08:35.810 --> 08:39.850]  And I was getting a little lengthy here, but I'm almost at the end.
[08:39.850 --> 08:43.890]  And in Prince George, I was a professor of wildlife genetics.
[08:43.890 --> 08:49.570]  And when I was doing this work, I worked for about two years as a professor and taught
[08:49.570 --> 08:55.130]  there and, you know, learned to discover the insane amount of snow that northern BC or
[08:55.130 --> 08:59.810]  even central BC get compared to the southern parts and down south in the US.
[08:59.810 --> 09:04.250]  So just tremendous experience of the elements.
[09:04.450 --> 09:10.650]  After a couple of years in 2014, something happened in Canada, which was moving to the
[09:10.650 --> 09:17.890]  MNPR, which opened up kind of the more commercial side of cannabis.
[09:17.890 --> 09:23.890]  And so when that happened, we packed up and decided to move down to Vancouver to essentially
[09:23.890 --> 09:29.090]  try our luck or even just focus on my true passion in life, which was always to study
[09:29.090 --> 09:29.610]  cannabis.
[09:30.330 --> 09:38.250]  So I started a couple of small cannabis technology companies in the genetic side and did some
[09:38.250 --> 09:42.610]  consulting for three or four years.
[09:43.330 --> 09:49.250]  Then in 2018, I went to work for the Flower Corporation in Kelowna, Lake Country, where
[09:49.250 --> 09:51.250]  I was the VP of R&D.
[09:51.370 --> 09:56.050]  So I set up a bunch of genetics programs for cannabis, especially on the characterization
[09:56.050 --> 09:56.770]  to discovery.
[09:57.530 --> 10:05.210]  I published my thoughts anyways on the origins of cannabis and how we can use genetics to
[10:06.130 --> 10:08.010]  authenticate particular varieties.
[10:08.010 --> 10:13.250]  So that was done with a group called Lighthouse Genomics that's based in Vancouver.
[10:14.250 --> 10:18.650]  I also started a couple of different labs or was involved in a couple of different testing
[10:18.650 --> 10:23.370]  labs, one in Las Vegas and one in Kelowna more recently.
[10:24.370 --> 10:36.290]  And yeah, my focus now is essentially on leveraging my research license to do tremendously
[10:36.290 --> 10:40.970]  interesting things around all this technology and nature.
[10:41.250 --> 10:49.090]  So things that go from importing, quote unquote, US hemp, which is not hemp.
[10:49.650 --> 10:58.690]  So high CBD expressing resin varieties bred in the US since 2018 and try to understand
[10:58.930 --> 11:06.330]  the true origin and what is hemp, what is CBD medical and how does that integrate into
[11:06.330 --> 11:09.970]  different parts of the supply chain for different types of products?
[11:09.970 --> 11:12.530]  Because there's a place for everything.
[11:12.530 --> 11:18.010]  There's a place for isolates and there's a place for live resin, vape cards and all kinds
[11:18.010 --> 11:24.370]  of things. And I'm really focused on the quality and the authentication of that and
[11:24.370 --> 11:28.410]  also the use of things like new breeding techniques.
[11:28.490 --> 11:37.370]  So, you know, using things like CRISPR or Talons or MAD7 enzymes to essentially edit
[11:37.370 --> 11:47.290]  and accelerate some of the transfer of traits to key commercial cultivars that for some
[11:47.290 --> 11:49.330]  reason makes sense to to have that happen.
[11:50.290 --> 11:54.370]  So hopefully that wasn't too long of an intro, but I think I've covered most of the things
[11:54.370 --> 11:57.170]  that I don't have it written down, so I'm sure I missed a few.
[11:57.650 --> 11:59.410]  It took us to a good spot.
[11:59.410 --> 12:00.530]  It's interesting.
[12:00.530 --> 12:04.170]  We were talking about hemp before the show started.
[12:04.490 --> 12:11.130]  I just think hemp is bad weed, but, you know, there's weed that is bred for rope.
[12:11.370 --> 12:13.290]  It's like for fiber, right?
[12:13.290 --> 12:17.890]  And so when I'm growing stuff that seems like it, it goes all the way back to the hemp
[12:17.890 --> 12:21.010]  stuff. It grows, you know, 14 feet tall and really skinny.
[12:21.010 --> 12:24.330]  And if you don't prune it, it's only got flower in the top 10 inches.
[12:24.330 --> 12:27.090]  And that's for me, that's kind of hemp.
[12:27.290 --> 12:34.210]  And then generally in the space, a lot of people say, OK, if it's point, you know, just a
[12:34.210 --> 12:38.730]  third of a percent THC, anything that is that they call hemp.
[12:39.050 --> 12:44.090]  But then you look at like you've got a little short Afghan looking one to ones and stuff
[12:44.090 --> 12:49.290]  like that. So talk a little bit about hemp and the distinction between one the other,
[12:49.290 --> 12:50.650]  because I see a distinction.
[12:50.650 --> 12:53.370]  You've got the three leaf fans, three to five.
[12:53.650 --> 12:55.090]  You've got the five to seven.
[12:55.090 --> 12:59.850]  And then you've got the ones that have like 11 family fingers on the fan.
[12:59.850 --> 13:03.850]  Yeah, well, you see, you see there is a definite differentiation.
[13:03.850 --> 13:08.290]  You know, when you get to the cookies lines, you got those fans with nine or 11 fingers on
[13:08.330 --> 13:13.050]  it. But then when you go to the Mendel blue dream or something, you're lucky to get five
[13:13.050 --> 13:15.330]  fingers. Absolutely.
[13:15.530 --> 13:20.090]  You know, this is this is a fascinating topic, and I'm glad you bring it up right off the
[13:20.090 --> 13:23.850]  bat because that's I got excited when you mentioned hemp and how you know what?
[13:25.130 --> 13:27.410]  Like you're saying, there's a gradient, right?
[13:27.450 --> 13:29.410]  There's a gradient of traits of different things.
[13:29.410 --> 13:36.370]  And clearly from the get go, there's a separation, first of all, on the origin, but then
[13:36.730 --> 13:39.210]  on the traits and on the select lines that people have.
[13:39.210 --> 13:40.410]  And unfortunately.
[13:45.850 --> 13:49.930]  Oh, boy, it froze up a little bit, please come back.
[13:52.130 --> 13:53.650]  I hope it's not me that's frozen.
[13:54.450 --> 13:55.930]  Yeah, it froze up pretty good.
[13:56.730 --> 13:58.250]  Yeah, yeah, it's not me.
[13:58.490 --> 14:00.810]  You're back. You just left for a minute.
[14:01.330 --> 14:03.010]  OK, I figured I saw it was.
[14:03.490 --> 14:04.690]  So essentially what I was saying is.
[14:07.490 --> 14:13.370]  I guess I want to talk about the concept of hitchhiking, genetic hitchhiking in what you
[14:13.370 --> 14:17.690]  talked about there, so I talked about the origin and saying, OK, you know, we do clearly
[14:17.690 --> 14:24.010]  have European hemp that is not a resin accumulator type variety.
[14:24.010 --> 14:28.410]  It's like you say, it's not only bred for rope, but it was probably initially always
[14:28.410 --> 14:34.650]  for rope. I've traveled through Eastern Europe and found rhodorhizal plants that, you know,
[14:34.650 --> 14:42.090]  we smell nice and we harvested, we try to smoke it, cure it in a tent or wherever we
[14:42.090 --> 14:43.130]  were doing fieldwork.
[14:43.490 --> 14:48.170]  And, you know, there's no there's no there's no expression, the trichomes aren't there.
[14:48.330 --> 14:53.330]  So clearly there's a separation, even though we see these gradients right now of, like
[14:53.370 --> 14:58.530]  I said, fan leaves and then all these straight CBD accumulation, CBD, THC, even trichome
[14:58.530 --> 15:06.210]  density, all the criteria that will make this plant valuable to you as a resin person,
[15:07.210 --> 15:08.650]  like I am as well, obviously.
[15:10.810 --> 15:15.530]  I agree with you that whatever is available right now is kind of sucks because because of
[15:15.530 --> 15:20.570]  the hitchhiking, because we've taken, you know, the nine fingered leaflets with the
[15:20.570 --> 15:25.770]  three fingered to try to get to an intermediate phenotype for the or even an extreme
[15:25.770 --> 15:29.770]  phenotype for the cannabinoid accumulation, which would be really, really high cannabinoid
[15:29.930 --> 15:32.690]  and only CBD, which is not going to be possible.
[15:33.210 --> 15:38.690]  It's always going to be 5% of in a wild type CBD synthase, always 5% is going to be
[15:38.690 --> 15:39.810]  something that's going to be THC.
[15:40.290 --> 15:45.770]  So 5% of that, it means, you know, you have to be at 1% cannabinoid if it's a 20% plus
[15:45.770 --> 15:48.730]  accumulator. So if you have 30%, forget it.
[15:48.730 --> 15:52.890]  You're over 1% with a wild type enzyme and CBD synthase.
[15:53.250 --> 15:55.010]  And that's not even the problem.
[15:55.010 --> 15:57.690]  The problem is, OK, you've got that CBD synthase.
[15:57.690 --> 16:00.650]  That's 5% infidelity towards THC.
[16:01.210 --> 16:06.010]  But now you also hitchhike a whole bunch of the shitty traits that you don't want.
[16:06.490 --> 16:10.450]  You don't want something that takes 14 weeks to flower or to finish.
[16:11.250 --> 16:17.090]  You don't want nasty cariophiline overload from the hemp line, whatever it is, right, or
[16:17.290 --> 16:18.650]  flavonoids or color traits.
[16:18.650 --> 16:21.330]  And that's not just present in hemp.
[16:21.330 --> 16:23.730]  Like I'm growing some St.
[16:23.730 --> 16:26.650]  Vincent red, red stock or something like that.
[16:27.290 --> 16:32.450]  And it's 14 feet tall and it's, you know, but it's zero CBD.
[16:33.010 --> 16:36.770]  So that's not just in hemp that we get these traits that we don't want.
[16:37.170 --> 16:40.370]  And if you're just breeding and doing a cross and selecting, you're always going to have
[16:40.370 --> 16:41.370]  some hitchhiking going on.
[16:41.890 --> 16:45.810]  And that's where it's like, well, if you have, you know, if we're open to leveraging
[16:45.810 --> 16:52.450]  genomic technologies and gene editing or new breeding techniques or whatever we were
[16:52.450 --> 16:58.170]  saying, you can actually take that one elite variety that is what works for your for your
[16:58.170 --> 17:02.050]  growth system, whether it's living soil or rock wool or anything in between.
[17:02.450 --> 17:03.450]  You're growing lights.
[17:03.450 --> 17:05.810]  If it's outdoors, lights, HPS, blah, blah, blah.
[17:05.850 --> 17:08.450]  All the things that go beyond my understanding.
[17:08.450 --> 17:12.050]  I can list the keywords, but I'm not definitely a cultivation expert at all.
[17:13.050 --> 17:14.130]  And I'd love to learn more.
[17:14.370 --> 17:18.650]  See if you can shed light on how the environmental can coax the expression of some
[17:18.650 --> 17:21.050]  genetics. That's something that is tremendously interesting.
[17:21.770 --> 17:28.370]  Is it is it coax or do they is it actually there for a reason and just waiting for you to
[17:28.370 --> 17:31.370]  put it together with the other side of the key?
[17:31.410 --> 17:33.330]  Like there are two pieces that fit together.
[17:33.330 --> 17:38.530]  And I find that certain strains actually play good with others to switch them.
[17:38.570 --> 17:42.570]  And and other strains, if you cross it to it, they'll steal the show.
[17:42.970 --> 17:47.450]  You know, so I've learned the old fashioned way by crossing stuff together and seeing what
[17:47.450 --> 17:49.330]  works, what works horribly.
[17:49.610 --> 17:56.250]  And then I I breed them and then see what I get, you know, and I've had a knack to picking
[17:56.250 --> 17:58.370]  the proper selection.
[17:58.730 --> 18:03.570]  What what do you do for for for like when you're saying.
[18:04.490 --> 18:11.290]  I stress my plants here immensely to to to see if they got the right hitchhikers.
[18:11.410 --> 18:16.490]  Right. So so I am looking for the hitchhikers and I've got a plan.
[18:16.490 --> 18:22.290]  And so what I do is I try to find which ones have the hitchhikers to to bring them in.
[18:22.650 --> 18:27.730]  And then I'll do back crosses to make sure I get rid of any of the other hitchhikers that came
[18:27.730 --> 18:31.890]  along with that. Or sometimes I'll have one that doesn't have what I need.
[18:31.890 --> 18:37.610]  I got to put the hitchhiker on it and then play with it to bring it back out into my
[18:37.650 --> 18:43.010]  cultivar. And a lot of people don't quite understand marker assisted breeding because
[18:43.730 --> 18:52.290]  where you have a a marker that's attached to a trait and that marker always marks the
[18:52.290 --> 18:55.490]  trait. And then when you cross it with other stuff, you don't have to grow it all the way
[18:55.490 --> 18:56.770]  out like I do.
[18:56.930 --> 19:01.450]  You can just grow it up, test it genetically and you know it's either it's got it or it
[19:02.330 --> 19:04.690]  was a little bit about marker assisted breeding.
[19:04.690 --> 19:08.290]  Because and why is all of this so important?
[19:08.890 --> 19:14.130]  The the genetics and we know this, but there's people that are watching that don't know
[19:14.130 --> 19:18.650]  why it is so important just not to to cross everything.
[19:18.650 --> 19:23.410]  You know, if you're a cook and you're a good chef, you know what spices play well with
[19:23.410 --> 19:29.450]  others, but you're not going to put, you know, stuff that doesn't fit cumin and vanilla
[19:29.450 --> 19:30.970]  together. It's just there's something.
[19:32.450 --> 19:37.090]  Well, Ron, you nailed it on the head there right from the beginning when you're talking
[19:37.090 --> 19:38.530]  about your process of selection.
[19:39.290 --> 19:44.170]  That's that's exactly what we're talking about here is having the insight and the
[19:44.170 --> 19:48.530]  understanding so that you can make the most rapid decision and have the least amount of
[19:48.530 --> 19:52.090]  effort in the phenol hunt, even beyond phenol hunt.
[19:52.090 --> 19:55.570]  When now you're doing like you're saying the back crossing, because that's there's no
[19:55.570 --> 19:56.970]  magic. There's no going around this.
[19:56.970 --> 19:58.850]  Doesn't matter what trait you have, what tools you have.
[19:59.210 --> 20:05.690]  You're going to have that same mindset of selection and understanding and detection,
[20:05.770 --> 20:06.810]  early detection.
[20:06.890 --> 20:11.290]  The expert that can detect a smell, the look, you know, something that you know came.
[20:11.770 --> 20:17.650]  And as you say, you identify the hitchhikers that are desirable and undesirable to speed
[20:17.650 --> 20:22.250]  that up. So essentially, marker assisted breeding is just leveraging these genomic genetic
[20:22.290 --> 20:26.890]  tools that aren't perfect, because I can tell you that, oh, yeah, this is the gene that
[20:26.890 --> 20:31.210]  does you know, this is the gene that does what's cool.
[20:33.130 --> 20:37.810]  THC, turpinellin, let's call it turpinellin instead of all the other ones, it's just
[20:37.810 --> 20:41.370]  turpinellin because it's a secondary trait, but it's super important.
[20:41.970 --> 20:44.810]  And then it's somehow associated with the ghost train haze line.
[20:45.690 --> 20:48.050]  Right, historically, I go get turpinellin, ghost train haze.
[20:48.330 --> 20:50.450]  Now you can be like, OK, now I know what I'm looking at.
[20:50.450 --> 20:56.450]  I want to bring this turpinellin and I want to put it inside of that, that cookies or
[20:56.450 --> 20:59.250]  whatever. Turpinellin, cookie, daytime cookie.
[21:02.010 --> 21:03.050]  Turpinellin is amazing.
[21:03.450 --> 21:07.250]  And I think when I was down in in Southern Africa, that's what I was also.
[21:08.130 --> 21:11.490]  There was some carry out, there was definitely turpinellin, and I think you can confuse it
[21:11.490 --> 21:13.490]  with limonene, obviously.
[21:13.530 --> 21:17.610]  But I think the combination of the two is that, you know, ghost train haze type, which
[21:17.610 --> 21:22.530]  would be more of a daytime, which would be more of something that, yeah, fruit.
[21:23.450 --> 21:29.610]  In any case, you would know with your nose how to determine and select that turpinellin
[21:29.610 --> 21:32.370]  out from from a bunch of plants that are growing and you go and you smell.
[21:32.930 --> 21:37.490]  Now, the marker assisted breeding will tell you that, oh, well, we have this, you know,
[21:37.490 --> 21:43.010]  either this region or multiple different spots in the genome that are in our data set, as
[21:43.610 --> 21:48.530]  deep as the data set or the universe of cannabis, cannabis genomes that we have available,
[21:49.490 --> 21:50.770]  which isn't universal.
[21:50.770 --> 21:53.410]  There's a lot of data out there, a lot of open projects.
[21:53.410 --> 21:57.410]  It's very patchy. But there are some groups that have some really high quality, long read
[21:57.890 --> 22:02.850]  assemblies that they can look at, put together and then essentially now leverage machine
[22:02.850 --> 22:08.050]  learning to start doing everything that we're talking about, doing the selection in silico
[22:08.410 --> 22:11.930]  and spits out and tells you out of the collection of whatever is there.
[22:12.330 --> 22:16.690]  Now, this is what you can do, but it doesn't involve it involves only.
[22:17.530 --> 22:23.210]  Models on the computer with obviously a human mind and and a team of people that can
[22:23.450 --> 22:27.890]  assemble this information from the genomics, the chemistry, the like you say, the
[22:28.290 --> 22:33.010]  the insight you get from just pushing your plants to the extreme to see if finally they're
[22:33.010 --> 22:38.090]  going to express either even susceptibility to a particular disease.
[22:38.610 --> 22:44.330]  Interestingly enough, one of the big interests is hop latent and also how maybe
[22:44.330 --> 22:50.250]  hop latent in itself is not necessarily going to be a problem for a
[22:50.250 --> 22:53.690]  grow unless there's a particular stress that's there.
[22:53.690 --> 22:56.650]  And that's where I was like, there's the epigenetic component.
[22:56.650 --> 23:00.850]  And that's why all these genetic markers aren't perfect, because somehow.
[23:01.970 --> 23:06.770]  You're able to either coax the environment or you can select and push for the expression
[23:06.770 --> 23:09.770]  of particular things. And then it's not always linear.
[23:09.890 --> 23:14.170]  If you have the marker and you put it on in this environment, you may get a different
[23:14.170 --> 23:20.610]  response. And that's the part that is also is also a tool that you use.
[23:20.770 --> 23:24.570]  But it's a tool that comes back and that we can use in a different fashion now to
[23:24.890 --> 23:30.890]  understand the process and also have people develop on the cultivation side, their
[23:31.490 --> 23:37.130]  own IP and stuff around, you know, using living soil versus rockwool as an example.
[23:37.570 --> 23:40.890]  We'll have a different end product.
[23:40.890 --> 23:45.810]  And the reason why that is, is because that environmental input influences the way that
[23:45.810 --> 23:49.130]  the genes are being expressed, whether the gene is there or the variant of the gene is
[23:49.130 --> 23:50.810]  there inside that particular plant.
[23:51.370 --> 23:54.410]  It doesn't always express like the purple color is the most simple one.
[23:54.410 --> 23:58.370]  If it's called purple, if it's not called green.
[23:58.890 --> 24:02.090]  Yeah. And then essentially that's not always the case.
[24:02.130 --> 24:05.610]  It doesn't apply to all the plants, but there is some of them that stop giving it
[24:05.610 --> 24:10.530]  potassium and it'll turn purple, too, or some other there's other things you can do.
[24:10.930 --> 24:14.770]  Interesting. But so that's just in the human body.
[24:14.970 --> 24:20.250]  We have in our genetics and like, let's say in our liver, I've studied the human
[24:20.250 --> 24:25.170]  genetics as well. And inside our liver, we've got our DNA all set up in our liver.
[24:25.210 --> 24:31.730]  But if our liver encounters toxins like what's the one that's in potatoes and
[24:31.730 --> 24:34.610]  bell peppers? There's a toxin in there.
[24:35.130 --> 24:37.290]  I think it starts with an L, but I've forgotten the name.
[24:38.050 --> 24:42.530]  But let's say there's a toxin you're eating and your body is not used to it.
[24:42.530 --> 24:49.370]  Right. Your liver, your liver will change its DNA the way, not not change the line,
[24:49.370 --> 24:52.130]  but it'll change the way it's rolled up on each other.
[24:52.130 --> 24:57.890]  So that different ones of those genes touch to make you immune to the lectin that's in
[24:57.890 --> 24:59.130]  that's in those things.
[24:59.130 --> 25:04.690]  So like some people are lactose intolerant, some people aren't.
[25:04.690 --> 25:07.370]  And and I believe that it's genetics.
[25:07.370 --> 25:09.330]  And so you're talking about cannabis.
[25:10.410 --> 25:17.890]  When when I test for powdery mildew resistance, what I do is I get a plant that I that
[25:18.010 --> 25:20.410]  has I find powdery mildew somehow.
[25:20.410 --> 25:25.250]  I make the perfect case to something that I know that gets it, get it covered with powdery
[25:25.250 --> 25:29.050]  mildew and then put it all over my plants and spray them with water in week five or six a
[25:29.050 --> 25:34.890]  flower. And if they don't get powdery mildew, I've just got my marker assisted breeding.
[25:34.890 --> 25:41.370]  You know, I I put the stuff on it, but it takes so long for me to do what I do that like
[25:41.370 --> 25:45.650]  in a lifetime, I've only been able to to work through 80, 80 plants.
[25:45.650 --> 25:50.170]  I've only been able to to work through 80, about 80, a little over 80 strains that I want
[25:50.170 --> 25:52.410]  to mess with and about 20 are done.
[25:53.170 --> 26:01.930]  And and I know with the marker assisted, if I got it, I could I could go through 100000
[26:01.930 --> 26:07.330]  plants in a year where I only go through three 300.
[26:07.930 --> 26:10.490]  Yeah, well, Ron, essentially.
[26:12.490 --> 26:18.530]  It takes whatever you did there to be able to now have a reliable marker assisted breeding
[26:18.530 --> 26:22.330]  program in the lines that you've worked with, right?
[26:22.690 --> 26:24.290]  Oh, they have to be already worked.
[26:24.890 --> 26:26.850]  Well, essentially, we have to dig somewhere.
[26:26.850 --> 26:31.970]  And so the work that you've done, if you know, if we could take that and now use that as a
[26:31.970 --> 26:35.890]  basis to that model that I was describing, that machine learning comes in and does its
[26:35.890 --> 26:40.610]  thing with with large amounts of data, large amounts of genomic data, large amounts of
[26:40.930 --> 26:44.330]  phenotypic data to essentially now be able to predict it.
[26:44.330 --> 26:47.090]  And that's so that's I'm saying it's feasible now.
[26:47.090 --> 26:48.650]  It wasn't feasible five, 10 years ago.
[26:49.970 --> 26:51.210]  So, yes.
[26:51.210 --> 26:54.530]  And then what you said there about the liver and how you've got DNA packaged.
[26:54.890 --> 26:59.770]  So if you look at DNA and say it's like one linear thing, like one straight line that is
[26:59.770 --> 27:04.410]  accessible to the expression machinery, because inside of the cells, it'd be waste.
[27:04.410 --> 27:05.570]  The cell would be wasting energy.
[27:05.570 --> 27:09.690]  Any cell, any organism would be wasting energy if it's constantly expressing every single
[27:09.690 --> 27:11.210]  gene inside the genome.
[27:11.690 --> 27:15.770]  Right. You know, 20,000 genes in the human genome or more, obviously, because we've
[27:15.770 --> 27:20.090]  discovered more. But if that's constantly pumping and going like we would never have the
[27:20.090 --> 27:24.370]  energy to develop into a full organism that's doing this, it has to be efficient and
[27:24.370 --> 27:30.010]  packaged away the stuff that's not currently needed in call it a root cell, not
[27:30.010 --> 27:33.410]  currently needed in the in the trichome cell.
[27:34.530 --> 27:38.050]  So in the root, you're not expressing terpenoids and cannabinoids because you'd be
[27:38.050 --> 27:41.290]  wasting that energy, even though you can probably detect some trace quantities.
[27:41.530 --> 27:42.690]  But that's essentially what it is.
[27:42.690 --> 27:47.850]  It's not a linear straight line of DNA accessible to the ribosomes to now take the DNA,
[27:47.850 --> 27:52.570]  create mRNA, then create the protein, which is then essentially what we see.
[27:52.970 --> 27:54.610]  You know, and it could be the human eye.
[27:54.610 --> 27:58.570]  It could be whatever. Like that's the epigenetics.
[27:59.210 --> 28:02.130]  Essentially, DNA isn't linear and always accessible.
[28:02.170 --> 28:06.010]  It gets packed away in proteins called histones and then it gets packed away in a
[28:06.010 --> 28:10.090]  different level. And there's multiple levels of taking that linear accessible code,
[28:10.290 --> 28:11.850]  packaging it so that you don't see it.
[28:12.370 --> 28:17.090]  So it's a really smart kind of if you look at computer code, smart way to just hide the
[28:17.090 --> 28:18.290]  code. The code is there.
[28:18.490 --> 28:20.570]  If anything, it's a compression.
[28:20.570 --> 28:24.250]  It's not a question. You stick it away somewhere where it's not used because it's not
[28:24.250 --> 28:29.650]  needed. And then that's when someone like you or the environment or the hand of God or
[28:29.650 --> 28:35.810]  anything can come in and coax it or make it all the sudden express that trait.
[28:36.730 --> 28:40.770]  And that's where, you know, essentially when you do genetic modification or it can come
[28:40.770 --> 28:43.810]  in and take the CBD synthase and say zero THC.
[28:43.810 --> 28:49.090]  This is a new engineered enzyme that's 100 percent fidelity or I've got the CBG, CBG,
[28:49.770 --> 28:52.690]  whichever one THC, anything super 100 percent fidelity.
[28:53.210 --> 28:57.890]  But then you also need to be able to make sure that that's being expressed, because if
[28:57.930 --> 28:59.810]  it's just sitting there in the genome, it's like, oh, great.
[29:00.170 --> 29:03.650]  But I'm never able to recreate a full plant from it that actually has a flower that
[29:03.650 --> 29:06.650]  actually has a tricone that actually can accumulate the cannabinoid.
[29:07.250 --> 29:11.850]  You know, so that's where I guess this is the place where I'm looking to work right now
[29:11.850 --> 29:16.210]  is to validate this, to say, you know, Ron, you've discovered the PM resistant marker or
[29:16.210 --> 29:18.770]  one for those 20 of the 80 lines that you have.
[29:19.330 --> 29:22.770]  Let's see if it's the same as the ones that the guys in Washington state discovered and
[29:22.770 --> 29:26.410]  published. Let's look at that region deep, much more deeper.
[29:26.410 --> 29:29.490]  So we have to look at the whole genome and look at this one region you identified.
[29:29.730 --> 29:33.330]  And this will be the marker assisted market that came out of your initial breeding
[29:33.330 --> 29:37.650]  program that then who knows could be licensed to everybody around the world to say you
[29:37.650 --> 29:38.890]  need PM resistance in your line.
[29:39.450 --> 29:44.690]  This is the marker. And or say I have pollen of this plant that is 100 percent homozygous
[29:44.690 --> 29:47.090]  for it. And I ship it to you.
[29:47.290 --> 29:51.330]  I walk you through the back crossing process using our markers.
[29:51.330 --> 29:54.970]  And what took me 20 years, 28 years to achieve.
[29:55.090 --> 30:01.090]  Now we can do it in maybe even 28 months or 24 months or less, maybe even.
[30:01.410 --> 30:04.170]  But just a way that that has to work.
[30:04.170 --> 30:08.690]  But it doesn't just fall out of the sky that somebody's got this terpeneline marker PM
[30:08.850 --> 30:10.370]  hoplite and viral resistant.
[30:10.970 --> 30:12.970]  But it does people call up and say, hey, I've got this.
[30:13.530 --> 30:15.130]  Everybody gets HLVD.
[30:15.130 --> 30:17.410]  My facility is HLVD, 100 percent everything.
[30:17.970 --> 30:22.690]  This one variety gets the finish and it's a 28 percent THC and it's everything is good
[30:23.130 --> 30:27.010]  under the sun. And that's the things that are interesting because you go and you look at
[30:27.010 --> 30:28.770]  that and say, what's going on with that genome?
[30:29.050 --> 30:30.770]  What's going on with their program?
[30:30.770 --> 30:34.610]  Do they have a bacteria in their soil that somehow is only with that plant?
[30:35.650 --> 30:37.170]  I don't know. And we don't know.
[30:37.170 --> 30:42.930]  And we need to essentially find out and eliminate, as you say, the hitchhiker or even the
[30:42.930 --> 30:47.810]  noise that's lurking around these massive amount of information, whether it's the DNA in
[30:47.810 --> 30:53.170]  the plants or the actual breeding programs and spreadsheets that we've been able to make
[30:53.730 --> 30:55.290]  to help us understand that.
[30:55.970 --> 31:01.090]  It's exciting. I'm looking forward to I can't imagine what we're going to have in 20 years
[31:02.210 --> 31:09.050]  available. I mean, it's going to change dramatically, maybe for the worse in some cases,
[31:10.050 --> 31:16.690]  because I'm not one that's that would be on board for protecting intellectual property.
[31:16.690 --> 31:20.090]  I mean, I would if you know, because I want everybody's money, just send it to me.
[31:20.330 --> 31:26.570]  But but as a human, when I think down, you know, if I find something that's powdery mildew
[31:26.570 --> 31:30.850]  resistant, I don't I don't have a strain that I made that I really made.
[31:30.850 --> 31:36.850]  I got some from somewhere and everybody handed me stuff here and there over 50 years.
[31:36.930 --> 31:41.610]  You know, and I've taken that stuff and messed around with it more lately than than back
[31:41.610 --> 31:43.330]  when. But I've had access.
[31:43.850 --> 31:48.210]  I've been blessed enough to have access to some really old genetics.
[31:48.210 --> 31:54.410]  And so I've been able to find hitchhikers in that really old genetics that are ridiculous.
[31:54.410 --> 31:59.090]  Oh, did did did Philippe lose his battery?
[31:59.530 --> 32:00.530]  I'm wondering.
[32:01.730 --> 32:02.730]  No, sorry, guys.
[32:02.730 --> 32:05.690]  Sorry, I had to look up something.
[32:06.050 --> 32:11.690]  Oh, so I had to confirm something that I wanted to, you know, what you alluded to there with
[32:11.690 --> 32:17.450]  the IP and corporate kind of style where things could be going.
[32:17.450 --> 32:19.290]  We're talking about these types of technologies.
[32:19.730 --> 32:25.290]  I wanted to bring up the fact that, I mean, in my career as an academic, I've always
[32:25.290 --> 32:28.250]  focused on open science, open research.
[32:28.250 --> 32:32.970]  I've always shared all my data on open so people can go download the data, do whatever
[32:32.970 --> 32:36.410]  they want with it, challenge my conclusions.
[32:37.850 --> 32:43.410]  And so this open access, open type licensing is what I've always been to, even with
[32:43.410 --> 32:48.650]  photography. Early on when I took photos, it was always under kind of a copy left type
[32:48.650 --> 32:52.250]  concept. And that's the word I was looking for when I disappeared slightly there to go on
[32:52.250 --> 32:57.210]  it on the discord that I'm a part of that's called Copy Left Cultivars.
[32:57.450 --> 33:02.290]  And that's just one initiative that essentially looks to, you know, to make this
[33:02.290 --> 33:05.690]  information accessible, because essentially, you know, the way the patent system works is
[33:05.690 --> 33:09.730]  that if something is actually out there in the public domain, it's it's unaccessible.
[33:09.730 --> 33:15.250]  It's a prior art and becomes makes the entire process of, you know, hiring lawyers and
[33:15.250 --> 33:18.810]  doing this IP game, even if it's protective.
[33:19.210 --> 33:24.330]  So this is for me is what I've always gravitated towards from a scientific perspective.
[33:24.450 --> 33:27.410]  As a human, I think that's what is the right thing to do.
[33:27.930 --> 33:34.570]  As a corollary in my personal life, I have an interest in my own health and whatever and
[33:34.930 --> 33:36.090]  and origins and that.
[33:36.090 --> 33:41.170]  So I did I was one of the people that did my 23andMe early on and spit in the cup and got
[33:41.170 --> 33:47.210]  my data and posted it on Open Human Projects and a whole bunch of other systems.
[33:47.210 --> 33:51.290]  And essentially for cannabis, we have the same that we have multiple companies that have
[33:51.730 --> 33:56.610]  the same technology as 23andMe, except 23andMe is like hundreds of thousands of marketers on
[33:56.610 --> 33:59.250]  their chip. But it's a it's a snip chip.
[34:00.170 --> 34:03.570]  You know, there's there's a 40 and a 90 thousand available for cannabis.
[34:03.810 --> 34:07.050]  And these are the type of tools that, you know, I've been using humans.
[34:07.050 --> 34:11.730]  And and and if we can actually gather that type of information and have it accessible in an
[34:11.730 --> 34:16.890]  open format, even if some of it is proprietary, it doesn't matter because the bulk of the
[34:16.890 --> 34:20.570]  data is accessible and they are initiatives to make that open.
[34:20.570 --> 34:25.650]  And for, you know, breeders and scientists and geneticists and just passionate people about
[34:25.650 --> 34:30.810]  cannabis can share that openly and and see, you know, how we can help each other.
[34:31.970 --> 34:36.250]  Battle some of these issues, like the hop latent, if you have a hop latent, you know,
[34:37.250 --> 34:39.890]  resistant cultivar, you know, sort of resistant.
[34:40.770 --> 34:45.170]  I think that's a great thing to put out there because someone out there probably already
[34:45.170 --> 34:51.130]  has a patent application in already for maybe two, three years on on exactly that.
[34:51.130 --> 34:57.050]  So if we can actually put it out in the open before that gets published and protected,
[34:57.050 --> 34:58.810]  then, you know, I think everybody wins.
[34:59.490 --> 35:00.730]  Except they have proof.
[35:00.770 --> 35:03.970]  Won't they have to prove it like that's what I find.
[35:03.970 --> 35:11.010]  It's so hard to get my head around is how somebody can intellectually lock down something.
[35:11.130 --> 35:14.610]  If I make a seed and my seed is really good and I've made a lot of them.
[35:14.810 --> 35:17.570]  If I give you a seed, you can ask one my seed.
[35:18.050 --> 35:22.770]  You can you can strip my my genetics and it's all yours.
[35:22.890 --> 35:24.530]  That's all you need is a seed.
[35:24.930 --> 35:25.810]  Yeah. And you know what?
[35:25.810 --> 35:31.930]  And that's why I mean, I'm you know, I guess some people say or I guess it is a fact that
[35:32.090 --> 35:33.530]  cannabis can cause paranoia.
[35:33.970 --> 35:38.370]  It doesn't do that to me, even though sometimes I get really cold and it's more of a
[35:38.370 --> 35:43.210]  de-element thing. But you could be paranoid and you want to and you want to protect and
[35:43.210 --> 35:45.690]  you can. But at the end of the day, it doesn't even matter.
[35:45.810 --> 35:47.050]  The systems are in place.
[35:47.490 --> 35:50.330]  The small guy is never going to win that battle.
[35:50.730 --> 35:53.730]  So if you're a small guy, then why are you playing this game?
[35:54.010 --> 35:58.250]  Why don't we just have an open system where we can actually be in an alternate to that
[35:58.250 --> 36:08.050]  and maybe even be at a place where we can even collectively make a deal with a
[36:08.050 --> 36:11.610]  corporation that would want to acquire the rights to something that we could say, sure,
[36:11.610 --> 36:13.210]  we could. I don't know.
[36:14.010 --> 36:15.410]  I think there's value.
[36:15.450 --> 36:22.530]  There's value. No, but as a small player and as a collective of people, I think there's
[36:22.530 --> 36:26.570]  other ways to play the game than to just chase where the bull is going.
[36:27.330 --> 36:32.050]  Right. We could go hang out with the bear and kind of focus on inwardly going into our
[36:32.050 --> 36:37.890]  caves in the winter and pondering these things and also taking our time because the
[36:38.010 --> 36:39.530]  promise of rapid.
[36:41.130 --> 36:46.170]  Rapid developments and whatever, it's the same thing as fast food, like it's great and
[36:46.170 --> 36:50.570]  all, it's very efficient, but don't you enjoy a nice slow cooked meal at home?
[36:51.010 --> 36:55.090]  You know, is that better than just a quick bite on the run?
[36:55.490 --> 37:00.210]  I think I mean, there's a place for everything, but I like I like that.
[37:00.210 --> 37:03.650]  And I think we can we don't have to get too excited about the technology and how we can
[37:03.650 --> 37:08.770]  speed things up because we have some pretty good, amazing cannabis out there at 30 plus
[37:08.770 --> 37:12.050]  percent with a variety of of other chemicals they accumulate.
[37:12.050 --> 37:15.690]  And we just need to understand how what's the what's the right product for that?
[37:15.730 --> 37:16.810]  What's the right place for it?
[37:17.450 --> 37:22.810]  If you're going to, you know, and that's, I think, to me, the most exciting part of the
[37:22.810 --> 37:29.570]  conversation here is how can we take the next step to actually integrate that these
[37:29.570 --> 37:30.610]  different areas together?
[37:31.210 --> 37:36.570]  Yeah, yeah. And if they want to do make a brand and copyright that or something, I'm all
[37:36.570 --> 37:38.650]  for that. That's why I do the gold hat thing.
[37:38.770 --> 37:41.570]  Right. You try to make a little something to get noticed.
[37:42.010 --> 37:48.850]  And but but if someone wants to take my seeds and make straight whatever they want to do
[37:48.850 --> 37:50.770]  out of them, I didn't invent them.
[37:50.810 --> 37:53.490]  So so for me, I'm going to let it go.
[37:53.850 --> 37:59.450]  But let's say let's say somebody did some frankenweed, which which let's dispel the
[37:59.450 --> 38:04.930]  myth that that someone's going to go into the genetic code and they're going to say,
[38:04.930 --> 38:06.890]  OK, I'm going to take this and put it in there.
[38:07.530 --> 38:09.690]  And what's the chance of that working out?
[38:11.890 --> 38:16.010]  To something good, because usually, like if I do computer code and I write a big code
[38:16.010 --> 38:21.090]  and then the page of the code, I just think, well, I'm just going to reverse six or seven
[38:21.090 --> 38:24.890]  of the pieces of code, you know, it's never going to work.
[38:24.930 --> 38:27.250]  You know, how are they going to do that with cannabis?
[38:30.350 --> 38:36.590]  Well, I think there's no question that we can take that linear code, you know, and
[38:36.590 --> 38:39.150]  change something. It's the tools are there.
[38:39.910 --> 38:42.550]  That's feasible. There's multiple tools.
[38:42.590 --> 38:47.470]  Again, this brings in, you know, CRISPR and then that brings in all the patents and the
[38:47.470 --> 38:53.550]  patent fights between MIT and Broad Institute and who invented it and was it the postdoc
[38:53.550 --> 38:57.470]  or so, you know, a really interesting topic.
[38:57.470 --> 39:01.350]  So that's feasible. And then there's also open alternatives to that, such as mad seven,
[39:01.350 --> 39:07.190]  which is another enzyme that does the same thing that doesn't have all the policy and
[39:07.190 --> 39:09.990]  or I don't even know what you call it.
[39:10.790 --> 39:14.230]  Bullshit associated with with it.
[39:14.230 --> 39:20.030]  So there's an open alternative to doing genetic editing on that.
[39:20.030 --> 39:24.830]  You know, it's like it's like to me in my mind, I can change the letter.
[39:24.830 --> 39:26.630]  I will change the letter. You can change the code.
[39:26.630 --> 39:30.430]  I can change the letter. You can change it if it's like whether it's THC versus CBD,
[39:30.430 --> 39:35.270]  whether it's PM susceptible versus PM resistant on those ones that we identify.
[39:36.270 --> 39:37.390]  That's that can be done.
[39:37.390 --> 39:40.630]  That can be done in an open fashion in a research setting.
[39:41.470 --> 39:47.550]  And my research license happens to also include that as one of the activities that is
[39:47.670 --> 39:48.670]  under my health care.
[39:48.670 --> 39:51.630]  And will it will it result in a benefit?
[39:51.630 --> 39:57.870]  I think because doesn't the DNA do similar stuff to human DNA where it doesn't just
[39:57.870 --> 40:00.190]  operate on one level?
[40:00.190 --> 40:01.910]  It's almost like three levels.
[40:01.910 --> 40:06.430]  It's like where it's got a twist up and and yeah.
[40:07.190 --> 40:10.510]  Well, I mean, it's maybe it's the butterfly effect, right?
[40:10.510 --> 40:15.870]  Like we there's the butterfly effect probably does apply to the genetic code.
[40:15.870 --> 40:20.270]  And when you have three billion base pairs and you go in to try to change one and you
[40:20.270 --> 40:23.270]  end up changing maybe three or three hundred or three thousand without knowing it.
[40:24.470 --> 40:30.030]  Yeah, yeah, you can definitely unknowns in the question and it could be it could create
[40:30.030 --> 40:31.110]  a hurricane on the other side.
[40:31.110 --> 40:33.430]  Absolutely. And it could do nothing at all as well.
[40:33.710 --> 40:41.750]  So the point is we can edit the linear code, but now putting it back into a living cell
[40:41.990 --> 40:45.030]  has been done for cannabis as well as for other plants.
[40:45.190 --> 40:47.110]  But then, you know, growing it.
[40:48.710 --> 40:54.070]  Then creating seed from it and all the next steps are still things that are in process
[40:54.070 --> 40:59.310]  or have been partially achieved and now need to be validated in the sense that, you know,
[40:59.310 --> 41:01.750]  much like you're saying you're looking at the plants which runs PM resistant.
[41:01.990 --> 41:04.630]  In this case, we would know we've edited this.
[41:04.630 --> 41:05.990]  This is the exact sequence.
[41:05.990 --> 41:09.430]  And it's very there's no it's very high fidelity.
[41:09.430 --> 41:13.310]  It's always going to amplify this region of the genome and nowhere else.
[41:13.310 --> 41:16.670]  So the chances of it editing anywhere else is very, very low.
[41:17.110 --> 41:23.790]  So we would go back and check and then essentially grow those plants out to validate, to
[41:23.790 --> 41:25.990]  actually do a phenol hunt, to be like, yeah, it's true.
[41:25.990 --> 41:30.830]  You know, it does have you know, it is a purple plant that has now the trait from the other
[41:30.830 --> 41:34.470]  line. I wanted it to be crossed, but it only has this one base pair difference.
[41:34.750 --> 41:36.510]  It doesn't have any of the hitchhikers.
[41:37.030 --> 41:41.390]  So that's the promise is to say no hitchhiker, same plant, one tiny difference.
[41:41.470 --> 41:42.910]  It's one tiny difference only.
[41:42.910 --> 41:46.430]  And we grew it back and it's homozygous and that trait.
[41:46.430 --> 41:50.470]  So if you if you back cross it, you just always have that trait there.
[41:50.470 --> 41:55.190]  And, you know, essentially that is there's promise that that's feasible.
[41:55.190 --> 41:56.510]  It just needs to be validated.
[41:56.750 --> 42:07.510]  And the actual seeds that allegedly contain an improved enzyme or a resistant allele still
[42:07.510 --> 42:09.830]  needs to be validated and grown out.
[42:09.830 --> 42:16.670]  And we can use these markers as the techniques in that case, just to screen in the very
[42:16.670 --> 42:21.870]  beginning. The first level of screening is if what you're saying, Ron, there is if we have
[42:21.870 --> 42:25.630]  some off target mutations created by the editing step.
[42:26.790 --> 42:33.390]  The the cell, which is a protoplast, it's a it's a cell without a cell wall, kind of a
[42:33.390 --> 42:39.110]  cell. It wouldn't even wouldn't be able to duplicate and grow and recreate a plant from
[42:39.110 --> 42:41.110]  it because it's too damaging of an effect.
[42:41.110 --> 42:43.390]  So that's the first level of selection.
[42:43.710 --> 42:45.870]  Just itself. You wouldn't make it pop the seed.
[42:46.110 --> 42:50.630]  The seed wouldn't pop or even just the cell that you've edited would not regenerate to
[42:50.630 --> 42:55.510]  two cells, three cells, a thousand cells, then a plant, let alone a rooted clone.
[42:55.590 --> 42:59.590]  Right. So everything operates in harmony the way it should.
[42:59.590 --> 43:01.750]  And then it turns out to be a net positive.
[43:02.470 --> 43:06.150]  It let me let me propose a question in a different angle.
[43:06.710 --> 43:10.870]  Let's say all things considered, they get this done.
[43:11.590 --> 43:18.750]  Monsanto, let's say one of the well-loved company Monsanto comes up with it somehow and
[43:18.750 --> 43:22.270]  they've got the genetic thing figured out and they modify a plant.
[43:22.270 --> 43:24.550]  They can make the seeds and you plant it.
[43:24.550 --> 43:26.310]  It's gold and it's the best thing ever.
[43:26.750 --> 43:33.310]  Now, now when when Monsanto's cannabis plant gets crossed with my cannabis plant, they've
[43:33.310 --> 43:39.150]  just poisoned all my genetics for the rest of time unless I can select their stuff out
[43:39.630 --> 43:42.150]  because I didn't ask.
[43:42.150 --> 43:43.510]  You know, I don't want it in there.
[43:43.510 --> 43:49.590]  But yet if they're able to slide that in, let's say somebody slides in a Trojan horse.
[43:49.590 --> 43:51.110]  Right. It's like a Trojan horse.
[43:51.110 --> 43:52.990]  They slide in this this thing.
[43:53.270 --> 43:54.270]  They patent it.
[43:54.550 --> 43:59.070]  And then by the time everybody finds out, oh, crud, we all have it.
[43:59.590 --> 44:02.150]  Then what? Then you owe them all.
[44:02.150 --> 44:05.390]  You've got you've got the trolls on you then at that point.
[44:06.430 --> 44:10.710]  I mean, I think, yeah, I think you're describing what's happened for corn and for other
[44:10.710 --> 44:11.950]  crops. Yeah.
[44:12.590 --> 44:18.590]  And that's, you know, if a company like that were to to do this to cannabis, 100 percent
[44:19.310 --> 44:20.870]  that could be played.
[44:20.910 --> 44:23.470]  That could be that could play out in a way like that.
[44:25.670 --> 44:30.390]  But again, that's where the, you know, the defensive IP and the organization around that
[44:30.390 --> 44:33.790]  is is key and the open access to it.
[44:33.790 --> 44:40.230]  So not allowing particular things to be either patented or even protecting what your
[44:40.230 --> 44:45.470]  very own 20, 80 lines and doing something about saying, OK, I'm putting it on the open.
[44:46.470 --> 44:50.630]  But I also have a certificate that says that this is, you know, whatever it is.
[44:51.950 --> 44:53.110]  It's kind of in between.
[44:53.110 --> 44:56.390]  It's like I don't know what the right thing is to exactly do.
[44:56.390 --> 44:58.870]  But at the end of the day, like you said, if you.
[45:00.950 --> 45:06.670]  There's ways for you not to take on the pollen that would be brought by that, there's no
[45:06.670 --> 45:11.230]  other ways that all of a sudden this new trait or this thing is going to propagate through
[45:11.390 --> 45:16.790]  the cannabis population because you're not even taking any pollen into your or I would
[45:16.790 --> 45:18.030]  assume people are very careful.
[45:18.710 --> 45:22.510]  And again, you know, it may be to a certain point that there's some areas we just can't
[45:22.510 --> 45:25.430]  grow because there is the potential for contamination.
[45:25.750 --> 45:29.710]  And it's not, you know, and that's where there's other technologies that are interesting,
[45:30.270 --> 45:34.430]  taking your plants, making them triploid, for example, now you're pollen proof.
[45:34.830 --> 45:36.510]  Right. So they've done that in the US.
[45:36.550 --> 45:38.510]  There's a couple of groups that also.
[45:39.070 --> 45:42.590]  I've had some that were close, but they still would put the odd seed on.
[45:44.750 --> 45:48.350]  They're very hard, you can just cover them with pollen and it would just set a couple of
[45:48.350 --> 45:49.910]  seeds, the rest of it would finish out.
[45:51.310 --> 45:56.830]  It's like, yes, that's not probably a good thing for me because I'm generally reversing
[45:56.830 --> 46:00.790]  plants and breeding, you know, so it's something I would select for the garbage.
[46:01.270 --> 46:05.830]  There's a time and place and there's people that don't do the same thing that would
[46:05.830 --> 46:09.870]  require. And that's the same thing is if you're worried about, if you're worried about
[46:09.910 --> 46:16.110]  cross contamination by a pollen, by either, even hemp, just call it just hemp, whatever's
[46:16.110 --> 46:17.630]  here. Somebody's got a hemp field.
[46:18.190 --> 46:21.670]  That's a major problem for you if you want to do outdoor cannabis in a valley, for
[46:21.670 --> 46:25.150]  example, there's wind. So, yeah, that sucks.
[46:25.430 --> 46:28.750]  But what if, you know, if that's what you're worried about, then then look at the
[46:28.750 --> 46:31.070]  technologies that can help you mitigate that.
[46:31.110 --> 46:35.190]  So the triploid, you know, hexaploid, whatever it is, and that's your line.
[46:35.190 --> 46:36.110]  It's still your line.
[46:36.390 --> 46:38.710]  Improve to fit the situation.
[46:38.710 --> 46:39.670]  Not going to move your farm.
[46:40.030 --> 46:40.990]  This is your family farm.
[46:40.990 --> 46:42.510]  You've been there for generations.
[46:42.950 --> 46:44.390]  Yeah. And you have a hemp farm down the road.
[46:44.430 --> 46:46.270]  I mean, why don't you just.
[46:47.550 --> 46:52.590]  I don't know, maybe I'm thinking too much, this is maybe 10 years, not the three, five
[46:52.590 --> 46:57.510]  year idea, but that's how it could happen because it makes sense to someone to all of
[46:57.510 --> 47:00.150]  a sudden say, I need this to be PM resistant.
[47:00.190 --> 47:01.670]  I need this to be pollen proof.
[47:01.990 --> 47:06.390]  I need, you know, I need the photo period to be better because I want to go in Yukon.
[47:07.910 --> 47:11.990]  You know, I think that's where there's the promise to be able to accelerate that.
[47:11.990 --> 47:15.950]  But in isolation from each other, if there isn't unity and the ability to kind of
[47:15.950 --> 47:20.110]  crosstalk, it's going to take a lot longer and it won't be as fun.
[47:20.830 --> 47:22.430]  Yeah, it's fun.
[47:22.430 --> 47:27.430]  But the big companies, if they see money in it, they'll come in and want to do that.
[47:27.590 --> 47:35.790]  What do you see is like, there's a lot of home growers that watch and some pros that I
[47:35.790 --> 47:38.190]  get letters all the time from people.
[47:38.190 --> 47:44.230]  What do you see the next five years being from the scientific level?
[47:44.270 --> 47:47.670]  How soon is some of this stuff going to get rolled into the mainstream?
[47:50.900 --> 47:56.220]  Well, I mean, probably the naive thing for me to say, based on what's going on in the
[47:56.220 --> 48:01.780]  news, which I don't really watch very much, but, you know, they are releasing and the
[48:01.780 --> 48:11.020]  USDA has approved some purple tomatoes, anthocyanin rich tomatoes, GM, but approved.
[48:11.020 --> 48:12.540]  And so they're on the shelf.
[48:12.540 --> 48:17.940]  You can buy them. So I would say, if anything, that is definitely or definitely that might
[48:17.940 --> 48:19.260]  definitely happen in cannabis.
[48:20.620 --> 48:22.180]  The next five years or do you think?
[48:22.180 --> 48:28.940]  No, I'd say five years is because that's the number you pick, but that goes back to.
[48:31.820 --> 48:37.740]  The regulatory bodies and also how it's so different from place to place, because if
[48:38.020 --> 48:41.780]  somebody was able to create a GM seed.
[48:44.340 --> 48:49.620]  The regulatory approval around that is still not clear and isn't still not vetted, that is
[48:49.620 --> 48:57.100]  the case that you can send, call it a purple tomato seed to Canada from the US and
[48:57.100 --> 49:01.460]  that's a farmer could grow that seed and owe royalty to the person that created that
[49:01.460 --> 49:02.420]  whatever down there.
[49:02.860 --> 49:04.260]  However, they want to do their business.
[49:05.260 --> 49:06.500]  That's not happening today.
[49:06.500 --> 49:10.340]  That might happen in the next five years and maybe cannabis will will be pretty close
[49:10.340 --> 49:11.940]  behind because you can do it for tomatoes.
[49:12.860 --> 49:16.540]  You know, you could do it for you can do it for mangoes and now you can grow mangoes in
[49:16.540 --> 49:18.060]  the Yukon or bananas or whatever.
[49:18.220 --> 49:23.060]  So just by selecting the traits of that purple tomato is something to look at, which is
[49:23.060 --> 49:26.540]  quite just as foreshadowing what could happen.
[49:27.340 --> 49:30.540]  But that's not what I would want to happen.
[49:30.540 --> 49:36.020]  I think what I would want to happen is to even do first the first steps, which is, you
[49:36.020 --> 49:39.940]  know, instead of thinking we can apply these technologies right off the bat, we still have
[49:39.940 --> 49:44.060]  to understand cannabis a little bit better because we haven't had the chance to study it
[49:44.060 --> 49:49.820]  quite as much as we have tomatoes and corn and all these other crops that have, you know,
[49:49.820 --> 49:55.900]  I would say probably 50, 70 years of agricultural research done on them in a, you know,
[49:55.900 --> 50:00.420]  I would say semi-organized fashion through the institutions in place throughout the world.
[50:00.860 --> 50:02.420]  Well, that's what I did in the past.
[50:02.420 --> 50:07.620]  I did a lot of floral breeding, so I bred vegetable seeds and flower seeds and I worked
[50:07.620 --> 50:11.140]  in the tomato industry, actually working on tomato seeds.
[50:11.140 --> 50:21.380]  And we found ways to protect it by doing crosses with polyhybrids that you have two
[50:21.380 --> 50:26.940]  cultivars that are different from each other, but when you have kind of a messed up, it
[50:26.940 --> 50:31.500]  was important to have a messed up background, but just messed up in a certain way.
[50:31.500 --> 50:36.620]  So the hitchhikers are all aligned in such a way where you take and you make seed from
[50:36.620 --> 50:41.900]  both of these plants from a cutting, tomato from a cutting, put them together, the seed
[50:41.900 --> 50:45.620]  that was made from that pairing will make a seed that's perfect.
[50:45.620 --> 50:49.980]  But all the hitchhikers come out the next generation, so you really can't do a lot of
[50:49.980 --> 50:51.740]  making your own seed from that.
[50:52.900 --> 50:53.900]  So I think that's something.
[50:53.900 --> 50:55.220]  Nice, that's a nice trick.
[50:55.220 --> 50:55.900]  That's really fun.
[50:55.900 --> 50:56.420]  And you know what?
[50:56.420 --> 51:00.140]  It applies very well to our favorite plant here.
[51:00.140 --> 51:01.660]  Yeah, well, it would.
[51:01.660 --> 51:04.980]  And that's why it's a hard time getting a strain.
[51:04.980 --> 51:10.100]  I've got certain strains that play so nice with others that I just put them together
[51:10.100 --> 51:15.620]  and these ones don't take over the show, but I have some of the high THC cultivars.
[51:16.460 --> 51:21.620]  When you cross them together, you don't get a lot of trichome production, but yet it's
[51:21.620 --> 51:22.860]  really strong weed.
[51:22.860 --> 51:24.660]  And so I've been crossing it with others.
[51:25.980 --> 51:27.780]  And it just steals the show.
[51:27.980 --> 51:33.740]  If I can cross it with something that you could have washed, it will be unwashable and
[51:33.740 --> 51:39.100]  then it will take it over and then you won't have as high of a THC anyway.
[51:39.740 --> 51:41.420]  It'll be higher, but not great.
[51:42.300 --> 51:42.820]  Wow.
[51:44.140 --> 51:48.500]  Well, that's fascinating and very exciting to think that that's feasible because, you
[51:48.500 --> 51:49.460]  know, actually that's.
[51:51.740 --> 51:53.660]  I'd like to talk offline a bit more.
[51:53.660 --> 51:57.100]  I have a strain that's growing right now at a university in Ontario.
[51:57.820 --> 51:58.660]  No, it's Quebec.
[51:59.820 --> 52:04.980]  A university there that is 35 percent more water efficient than any strain that they've
[52:04.980 --> 52:05.740]  ever tested.
[52:06.420 --> 52:07.220]  And I knew it.
[52:07.220 --> 52:09.180]  I knew it was really drought resistant.
[52:09.180 --> 52:13.020]  But the funny thing is I bred that for the most part in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[52:14.420 --> 52:23.660]  And I wonder if getting to be 120 degrees Fahrenheit in August and being so hot and
[52:23.660 --> 52:27.940]  no humidity and stuff, if that contributed to turn on those genes, I don't know.
[52:27.940 --> 52:28.820]  But I have it here.
[52:29.500 --> 52:30.340]  I've crossed it.
[52:30.340 --> 52:30.860]  I made it.
[52:30.860 --> 52:32.260]  It's there at the university.
[52:32.780 --> 52:36.780]  They can go three weeks with no water in a pot, three weeks.
[52:36.780 --> 52:38.500]  And he says none of them will take that.
[52:38.500 --> 52:42.420]  And this will just kind of go into a stasis.
[52:42.700 --> 52:46.900]  And then and then as soon as you water it, it just comes right out and it does not mess
[52:46.940 --> 52:47.580]  miss a beat.
[52:48.580 --> 52:49.100]  Damn.
[52:50.060 --> 52:58.020]  Well, I don't think that I I don't know that it has a trait that's easily passed on,
[52:58.020 --> 53:03.740]  but I would be willing to get it to anybody who could do this kind of digging down to
[53:03.740 --> 53:07.780]  find out why it is doing what it's doing, because it's a really great strain.
[53:07.820 --> 53:14.020]  Huge yielder, big trichomes, nice fruity flavor.
[53:14.300 --> 53:14.820]  Wow.
[53:15.660 --> 53:18.140]  Yeah, let's let's definitely start.
[53:18.180 --> 53:23.580]  I'd love to help characterize the genetic background, even at a kind of a higher level.
[53:24.700 --> 53:29.780]  You know, with one of those chips, like I mentioned, the 23andMe style level.
[53:29.780 --> 53:31.860]  So you get, you know, tens of thousands.
[53:31.860 --> 53:34.220]  A lot of genetics that I don't know anything about.
[53:34.220 --> 53:38.740]  It's got cherry pie that goes all the way back 20 years ago or whatever the original.
[53:39.140 --> 53:42.940]  And I've been resetting it and selecting it just just to keep the seed reset.
[53:42.940 --> 53:45.580]  So it's fresh and it's got that in it.
[53:45.620 --> 53:49.220]  And then I crossed it to wedding cake, just wedding cake.
[53:49.220 --> 53:51.620]  Right. And wedding cake we're all accustomed to.
[53:51.940 --> 53:53.460]  And bang, there it was.
[53:53.500 --> 53:55.580]  It just grew like it was on steroids.
[53:57.460 --> 53:58.060]  Splendid.
[53:58.700 --> 53:59.220]  Yeah.
[53:59.940 --> 54:02.780]  Well, what else can we talk about?
[54:03.060 --> 54:06.900]  We're just getting close to the end, and I know that we have some questions lined up,
[54:06.900 --> 54:07.420]  I think.
[54:08.860 --> 54:10.780]  Is there any questions on the list there?
[54:10.780 --> 54:11.780]  Yeah, a couple.
[54:11.900 --> 54:16.860]  So if you guys, if anybody has any more questions, throw them down.
[54:16.860 --> 54:21.740]  But for now, we'll get started with some questions from CIDI that I've saved.
[54:22.820 --> 54:27.660]  So using genomic analysis to select for your preferred traits question.
[54:28.500 --> 54:34.540]  How close are we as scientific community to being able to consistently associate non-cannabinoid
[54:34.540 --> 54:36.220]  traits with specific genes?
[54:36.340 --> 54:37.340]  Ron, you want to tackle it?
[54:37.340 --> 54:37.860]  I'm just kidding.
[54:38.380 --> 54:39.380]  Non-cannabinoid.
[54:39.380 --> 54:40.380]  No, I'm joking.
[54:40.380 --> 54:43.500]  I'm going, that would go to structure or something.
[54:43.500 --> 54:46.460]  I'm sure that you would know.
[54:46.460 --> 54:47.460]  I have no idea.
[54:47.460 --> 54:49.500]  Well, I mean, it could be any trait.
[54:49.500 --> 54:52.140]  And I think we discussed the resistance.
[54:52.460 --> 54:52.960]  Yeah.
[54:53.860 --> 54:55.900]  Anthocyanin, you know, purple.
[54:57.540 --> 54:59.820]  The photo period, the photo period.
[54:59.860 --> 55:03.300]  I mean, all of these things, you know, to answer the question, I think it's a good
[55:03.300 --> 55:04.300]  quickest way possible.
[55:04.300 --> 55:05.300]  It's already been done.
[55:05.300 --> 55:09.300]  There's published papers, there's patents on PM resistance.
[55:09.300 --> 55:14.300]  So that's where, you know, there's patents and then there's published papers with prior
[55:14.300 --> 55:16.300]  art that is essentially available.
[55:16.300 --> 55:21.300]  And when I mentioned Lighthouse Genomics, they have, when you run the 40,000 markers,
[55:21.300 --> 55:25.300]  they have, they've got the PM resistance, which was discovered using that chip that
[55:25.300 --> 55:26.300]  was used to make the gene.
[55:26.300 --> 55:27.300]  And so that's where we're at.
[55:27.300 --> 55:28.300]  And I think that's where we're at.
[55:28.300 --> 55:31.300]  And when you run the 40,000 markers, they have, they've got the PM resistance, which
[55:31.300 --> 55:36.300]  was discovered using that chip, the technology by a group called Dewey Scientific down in
[55:36.300 --> 55:37.300]  the US.
[55:37.300 --> 55:43.300]  And I believe some other, some of the, some other groups involved in kind of funding and
[55:43.300 --> 55:50.300]  protecting the IP around some of the PM resistance traits discovered in those populations, which
[55:50.300 --> 55:53.300]  are not THC populations.
[55:53.300 --> 55:54.300]  So that's interesting.
[55:54.300 --> 55:59.300]  Side point, when we're saying we don't like hemp, because in the US, the hemp that they're
[55:59.300 --> 56:06.300]  growing isn't the European, you know, nut and or fiber and or oil seed.
[56:06.300 --> 56:12.300]  You know, it's, it's a, there's some hitchhiking going on, but it's, you know, mostly an Afghani
[56:12.300 --> 56:20.300]  descendant plant with a lot of, you know, in any case, it's been done for a lot of non-cannabinoid
[56:20.300 --> 56:21.300]  traits.
[56:21.300 --> 56:22.300]  And those are clearly healed.
[56:22.300 --> 56:26.300]  People have also looked at even just doing hexaploids.
[56:26.300 --> 56:32.300]  So companies like Canopy Growth really early on already had IP and patents on, or I think
[56:32.300 --> 56:38.300]  they were granted patents on hexaploid, cannabis and or improved enzymes.
[56:38.300 --> 56:47.300]  So I think we're really looking now at the next generation of these more coming out as
[56:47.300 --> 56:52.300]  a genetically edited enzyme that's being used to produce cannabinoids and with really high
[56:52.300 --> 56:59.300]  fidelity in a microbial system, in microalgae and bacteria and yeast, and then bringing
[56:59.300 --> 57:05.300]  it back into the plant as well, because the plant is such an efficient, such an efficient
[57:05.300 --> 57:06.300]  biological factory.
[57:06.300 --> 57:11.300]  Like, why would you want to consume something made from yeast?
[57:11.300 --> 57:16.300]  You know, for example, like that would be my personal choice as a consumer.
[57:16.300 --> 57:19.300]  So, you know, bringing it back to the plant, I think makes sense.
[57:19.300 --> 57:20.300]  And that's now the next challenge.
[57:20.300 --> 57:25.300]  I think that's where we're headed when we're talking purple tomato is an enhanced trait
[57:25.300 --> 57:29.300]  that is, you know, could be, there's a reason the purpose of that tomato is anthocyanin,
[57:29.300 --> 57:30.300]  it's a health reason.
[57:30.300 --> 57:32.300]  Oh, it's a health reason.
[57:32.300 --> 57:42.300]  But again, it's all somehow orchestrated, I guess, by higher powers or just big machines,
[57:43.300 --> 57:49.300]  I guess, that have lost the human emotion and touch and beyond my understanding, you
[57:49.300 --> 57:50.300]  know, for that.
[57:50.300 --> 57:55.300]  But I think it's going to happen.
[57:55.300 --> 57:58.300]  You know, it's happening.
[57:58.300 --> 58:02.300]  And, you know, there's a chance that we can really leverage the grassroots efforts of
[58:02.300 --> 58:07.300]  just the overwhelming diversity, which brought me to cannabis in the first place, is, you
[58:08.300 --> 58:13.300]  know, everybody's not everybody, people have been breeding for a long time and have unique
[58:13.300 --> 58:14.300]  insights.
[58:14.300 --> 58:19.300]  That is, you know, if it's not recorded, it then becomes like some of the way that the
[58:19.300 --> 58:25.300]  traditional societies have been run where it's just oral history and it eventually gets
[58:25.300 --> 58:30.300]  lost because it doesn't get propagated or passed on fast enough.
[58:30.300 --> 58:34.300]  And I think that's one point that, you know, Ron, when you said, and this is sorry about
[58:34.300 --> 58:39.300]  the question, I'm diverting, but I wanted to bring it back to the, you know, indigenous
[58:39.300 --> 58:43.300]  knowledge and how we have to acknowledge that.
[58:43.300 --> 58:45.300]  Ron, you say the seed, I didn't create the seed.
[58:45.300 --> 58:47.300]  I don't, you know, where did it come from?
[58:47.300 --> 58:53.300]  If we can use genetics to say, hell, it's got some Congo origin, it had some, you know,
[58:53.300 --> 58:57.300]  Jamaican or it went through the Caribbean and, you know, this part of the genome came
[58:57.300 --> 58:58.300]  from there.
[58:58.300 --> 59:02.300]  Even if it's just a model, it helps us acknowledge that and kind of bring it back to, say,
[59:03.300 --> 59:06.300]  terpenoline originated from Southern African traits.
[59:06.300 --> 59:13.300]  And we give thanks and praises to Malawi and Swaziland and Mozambique, South Africa for
[59:13.300 --> 59:23.300]  that particular heritage and unique trait and the daytime cannabis and, you know, dichotomy
[59:23.300 --> 59:26.300]  between Indica and Sativa, even though there's a lot of debate around it.
[59:26.300 --> 59:30.300]  I think there's still a place for that language that has common understanding to be like
[59:30.300 --> 59:37.300]  daytime, daytime, nighttime, limonene, terpenoline versus myrcene, pionine, blah, blah, blah.
[59:37.300 --> 59:42.300]  You know, these major categories that then help us just understand it and then make it,
[59:42.300 --> 59:47.300]  you know, add the non-cannabinoid component that would be then, oh, the esters, you know,
[59:47.300 --> 59:54.300]  when we're looking at the more fruity ones, the thiols, when we get more skunky, gassy.
[59:54.300 --> 59:59.300]  So, yeah, part of improving the overall experience, whether it's the efficiency of
[59:59.300 --> 01:00:02.300]  production or the end user.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:06.300]  I think that's where we're headed over the next five, 10 years.
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.300]  There you go.
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.300]  Another question.
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:17.300]  Can you talk about how useful it can be to have a large public open source databases
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:24.300]  of genetic and phenotypic for the development of these types of marker-assisted tools?
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:28.300]  You mentioned this a little bit, but I thought maybe you'd want to go in a little bit more
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.300]  about this.
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:30.300]  Yeah, sure.
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.300]  Here, I'm going to do something.
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:37.340]  So, I made a cloud.
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:44.340]  I don't know if anybody saw it, but just for, so there's a cloud of information, and that's
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:51.340]  all of these bits and pieces that, you know, genetic, you know, chemotypic, phenotypic,
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:56.340]  breeder insights, healed, blah, blah, blah, you name it.
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:01.340]  These are all these data points in this big cloud in a three-dimensional, four-dimensional
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:06.340]  space, you know, or multi-dimensional, as many as you wish.
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:12.340]  But what you're trying to do, and this is essentially multivariate statistics, is you're
[01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:18.340]  trying to draw straight lines across this cloud of data that will explain the most variance
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:20.340]  in whatever it is you're looking at.
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:26.340]  So, if it's monoterpene versus sesquiterpene content, then you're going to have a line
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:29.340]  that goes, you know, this way.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:32.340]  And then if it's, you know, THC versus CBD, it's going to go this way.
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:39.340]  If it's, you know, healed, all of those is obviously a model across this cloud or this
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.340]  universe.
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:44.340]  It could be a universe, because the universe also has, you know, a whole bunch of little
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:46.340]  particles, planets and things all over it.
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:50.340]  So, we can create this cannabis universe, and it already exists.
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:55.340]  And the concept is to now actually unify some of that information so that it makes a lot
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:02:00.340]  of sense, that you can look through that universe, draw these parallel lines or these lines at
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:05.340]  tangents of 90 degrees, because the first dimension explains the most, the second, the
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:10.340]  second most, the third, fourth, as many as you'd like to select for your given model
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:13.340]  that makes sense, given the amount of information in there.
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.340]  So, that's multivariate.
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:23.340]  And then explaining that is now, you know, essentially how you're able to find one area
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:31.340]  of the genome that somehow explains the variation in the phenotypic traits or in the
[01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:32.340]  chemotypic trait.
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:36.340]  So, it's multidimensional, and you can blend them together.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:45.340]  And to use, you know, the scrambled egg concept, you are able to find the dimensions that
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:51.340]  explain what led to you taking these two parts of that egg, scrambling it together, and
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:55.340]  now, you know, with air and everything around it, creating something that you think you
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:59.340]  couldn't tease apart anymore, but we can remodel it to go back.
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:05.340]  And then that becomes, you know, essentially your targets that now you can assay and
[01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:10.340]  use using technologies such as qPCR.
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:13.340]  So, how we've tested for COVID is qPCR.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:16.340]  So, you detect a tiny piece of DNA or RNA in that case.
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:19.340]  So, that's RT-qPCR reverse transcriptase.
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:22.340]  Also, the same technology used to test for hoplite and vireate.
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:28.340]  When you get a test at the lab, it's RT-qPCR reverse transcriptase, takes the RNA of the
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:31.340]  virus and, you know, creates a cDNA strain.
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:36.340]  And then you run the PCR, which is cycling through and accumulating fluorescence if the
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.340]  trait is there or if the marker is there.
[01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.340]  So, that's the actual way you would do it.
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:45.340]  Or there's, you know, if you need to do a larger scale, not just one or two targets
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:48.340]  like larger, there's other sequencing technologies you can leverage.
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:54.340]  But I think we can take that for the next technical discussion.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:04:00.340]  Yeah, basically, what we're doing right now is unscrambling the egg.
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.340]  And like, but it had to start at some point.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:10.340]  But it's everything, every strain that's out there, everything is just scramble somebody
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.340]  else's omelet in my omelet.
[01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.340]  Right?
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.340]  It's like you're, you've got scrambled eggs from them.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:19.340]  And that may be really stable scrambled eggs, right?
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.340]  It's the same omelet all the time.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.340]  But it is an omelet, right?
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:25.340]  Then you have another one.
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:28.340]  And so, it's always scrambling the eggs.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:32.340]  And we're unscrambling the eggs a little at a time.
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:40.340]  But I think there's, my money is on old time breeders who are able to look at it and go,
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:42.340]  okay, that's no good.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:43.340]  Or that's good.
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:47.340]  You know, eventually, the science will catch up to it.
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:52.340]  But I don't know that they're going to be able to pass it, pass up human beings.
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:53.340]  Well, there's no doubt.
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:05:03.340]  And honestly, what you described about the polyhybrid strategy to protect, if you were
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:06.340]  to want to protect it, I mean, I think that's absolutely perfect.
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:11.340]  Because you want to maintain, if you're a producer, you want to maintain clones or tissue
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.340]  cultures of your plants anyways.
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:15.340]  And that has to be with high fidelity.
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:21.340]  And if anybody wants to take it, and I guess they'd have to, they could just clone it as
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.340]  well, if they wanted to.
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.340]  But they would have to know the math.
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:31.340]  Yeah, if somebody got my seeds and they ran it out, it would have so much ancillary BS
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:36.340]  that they're going to have a hard time selecting it down to the two that I put together to
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.340]  make that water-resistant strain.
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:42.340]  You know, you might be able to pick it up as a hitchhiker somewhere and knock your head
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:46.340]  out against a wall for a couple of years to try to get it.
[01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.340]  You could get it.
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:53.340]  But to me, that's my best way of protecting stuff is to cross it with stuff and then make
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:58.340]  other stuff that I know that's enough different that would mess it up a little bit to make
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.340]  it harder for people to steal it.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.340]  But people, they take your stuff.
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:06.340]  If I'm sending it, like if you were a breeder and I was sending you seeds, I'd send my best
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:10.340]  stuff, the stuff that's stable that you could use.
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:16.340]  And it would make better and better and better product as long as you made the right shift.
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.340]  Absolutely.
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:26.340]  And you know, and the beautiful part of it too, what you're saying there is the fact
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:33.340]  that whatever the big corporation may be protecting around powdery mildew resistance, there's
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:39.340]  a very strong chance that what you've done in your own programs is different.
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:45.340]  You know, there's multiple roads or all roads lead to Rome.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.340]  Multiple, anyways.
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:51.340]  It's not just a magical thing that's going to be throughout cannabis.
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:55.340]  And if you look at the diversity of the genus, chances are that it's definitely not the same.
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:07:00.340]  So it doesn't even matter who's doing what and patenting what because your lines that
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:03.340]  you've actually created, that's the best protection is that you actually did it.
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.340]  And you actually know which one it is.
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.340]  Not all of them.
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.340]  I've only got about eight that I can do that with.
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:14.340]  Well, if we can understand it now, then you can be like, okay, do I want to now leverage
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:19.340]  the technology to be able to have all my 80 or this particular one that I've got a customer
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:23.340]  that wants that one with that trade and I need to now create this, I have an incentive
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.340]  and I need to do it.
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:30.340]  Why would I repeat the whole experiment if I can just try another route that may help
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:31.340]  fast track?
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.340]  Yeah.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:33.340]  Right.
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:34.340]  It's fun.
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:35.340]  It's fun.
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:38.340]  It's why I love doing it because there's some magic involved.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:43.340]  There's a lot of skill involved, but there is a point where it's magic.
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:51.340]  Like I've got this one white runs crossed with an old, old string that I have.
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:56.340]  It came out phenomenal and I don't know what happened, but I'm going to make it some more
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:58.340]  of them this next year.
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:04.340]  Man, just the biggest bomber stems, big bomb buds, and it's like the wonderful chemotype.
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:09.340]  So it's interesting how you can get some magic out of just one cross.
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:12.340]  You don't have to do any back crosses or anything.
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:18.340]  And other times I've got stuff that I've back crossed or, or line bred for forever.
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:21.340]  And it seems like it, it'll never get stable.
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:26.340]  I don't know whether it's a hitchhikers or whether it's me starting to grow it in a different
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:29.340]  climate and then moving to this climate.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:32.340]  I don't know, but it's, it's certainly, it's fun to do.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:36.340]  And I'm sure everybody watching today does that.
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.340]  They cross their seats.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:39.340]  London does it.
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.340]  We all do it.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:45.340]  What advice could you give my main advice to anybody who's going to breed is have a plan.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:50.340]  Know where you want to go and where you're starting from and everything.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:51.340]  It's it.
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:54.340]  That's the most important part because you've got a goal and you know what you have.
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:09:00.340]  What would be your word of wisdom from a scientific perspective that, that someone could take
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:02.340]  home and use in their own breeding?
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.340]  Wow.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:13.340]  Well as you were talking about magic there, I realize how, if I was to have to pass on any word of wisdom,
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:22.340]  it'd be that, you know, science has a, has a place and is definitely a thing and a way of looking at,
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:30.340]  at life and these things, but we should never get so raised or focused on the tools and the technologies and how
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:37.340]  they can help us because, you know, we forget that there's that magic component, that there's the love that we
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:40.340]  put into something that will make it different.
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:50.340]  And again, back to the, to the food, the slow food or the craft product versus something that's more refined and
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:54.340]  or more, not refined, but processed.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:55.340]  Right.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:10:00.340]  I think that's, that's where I go to is like, yes, let's use the technologies.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:05.340]  Let's live a comfortable life with, you know, what's accessible.
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:12.340]  But at the same time, not get lost in numbers and models and science and clouds of data because that,
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:13.340]  that is not reality.
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:14.340]  That's a model.
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:22.340]  Reality is the farmer that's in earnest or in righteousness, doing what they love.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:32.340]  And you can, you can tell the difference in the product and it doesn't matter whether you're a honeymaker or a hashmaker.
[01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:33.340]  That speaks for itself.
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:34.340]  Yeah.
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:37.340]  They focus on what they're doing and take pride in it.
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:41.340]  You're never going to get an algorithm to take pride in what they do.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:46.340]  But, but someone creates it to, to do the sift for them or something like that, I guess.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:50.340]  Well, that's, that's cool to understand.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:54.340]  Any more questions that we got London or we're right about it.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:11:01.340]  Yeah, we're right about at the end time and my kids are getting start needing to get fed or I'm going to start having a screaming in the background pretty quick here.
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.340]  I'm losing, I'm losing my voice too.
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:06.340]  I got that, that Alberta cold that's going around.
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:09.340]  So it's kind of, kind of crackling.
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:10.340]  You mean winter?
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:11.340]  Is that winter?
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:18.810]  Yeah, it's, it's a white, it's white everywhere outside.
[01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:19.810]  All right.
[01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:23.810]  Well, Philippe, thank you for coming on here and talking with us.
[01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:27.810]  We will get together and we'll do some research in the, in the future for sure.
[01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:32.810]  Again, I'll talk, I'll have you out here to the rancher soon.
[01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:37.810]  London's going to play a little bit of an, an exit thing.
[01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:47.810]  Before we go, if you want to let us know a way we can, people can get in touch with you or be, how can we help you?
[01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:58.810]  Yeah, I mean, I, you know, I alluded a few times to, you know, the insight that can be gained from, from open and collaborative initiatives.
[01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:15.810]  And maybe that's, you know, what I'd like to, you know, turn it back or turn the spotlight back on you and you, Ron and London for creating a platform, I guess, where we can, you know, we can please get to know each other or know of each other.
[01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:29.810]  And I would love to hear from, from everybody who has any insight on, on cannabis and their plants and their particular program and how they want to, you know, establish themselves or their skill.
[01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:32.810]  Because that's, you know, I think that's, that's what I want to do.
[01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:44.810]  I want to, I want to support copy left cultivars on a leverage, the technology that's there to just help us create a very, very efficient and fun industry.
[01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:56.810]  So I don't know where we get ahold of each other, but you can probably find me on Twitter, Instagram, probably on the YouTube channel for this, if there is one or whatever, but you can see my name there.
[01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:57.810]  You can Google me.
[01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:11.810]  I think that and cannabis, you should, you should find me pretty easily, but yeah, otherwise happy for you guys to share my email address that you've been using on the platform for anyone to reach out for sure.
[01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:12.810]  Okay.
[01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:14.810]  Well, it's been great having everybody.
[01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:19.810]  London's going to do a little intro extra and we will see everybody next week.
[01:13:19.810 --> 01:13:21.810]  Who we have on next week.
[01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:22.810]  Next week is.
[01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:24.810]  I'm not, I'm not a hundred percent.
[01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:25.810]  Sure.
[01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:26.810]  I got it up to check.
[01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:27.810]  See, we have confirmed for that one.
[01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:28.810]  And it's still a little bit.
[01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:29.810]  As far as I can tell.
[01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:30.810]  I'll see.
[01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:31.810]  Is that something like that?
[01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:33.810]  Maybe it's Atlas.
[01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:34.810]  And then, then we're going for Joe Dria.
[01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:37.810]  I think he's the one after that one that we're going to go for, but yeah.
[01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:40.810]  I would like to just do a nice lineup.
[01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:42.810]  Beans check out dagger.
[01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:45.810]  Garden, of course, future cannabis project gives us a place to post.
[01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:48.810]  So make sure to, if you're going to buy some beans, go check that out.
[01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:50.810]  But yeah, I'll play us out.
[01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:52.810]  There's a little outro and we'll have a good day.
