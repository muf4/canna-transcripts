Hello everybody, this is Chad Westport and I just wanted to pop in here and show you
a really quick grow hack.
When you don't have trellis to kind of spread out your plant or the branches, the grow hack
I'm showing you today is binder clips.
So this plant is getting ready for flower and as you can see, I've done a pretty good
job of spreading out my main terminals to produce more colas than if I just let this
grow in the traditional Christmas tree shape.
And kind of how I help spread that out is through the use of these twist ties and my
grow hack of binder clips.
Generally speaking, after about a week or two of being held in the new position by the
twist ties and the binder clips, the branches will take that form or keep that shape when
you remove them.
So this skunk number one plant is going to have the twist ties removed before I put it
into flower.
On this temple runts plant, I've already removed the twist ties and as you can see here and
here, it held its shape from when it was bound and tied down, which allowed these to
grow up around it and these to fill out in the middle.
So more colas here.
Because of the way I use my binder clips and spread this temple runts out, as you can see,
there's now plenty of tops on the plant and it's all because of this training.
So real quick, let me recreate the binder clips on this plant.
Whatever size of pot you're using, they have a binder clip for you.
They've got large, they've got medium, and they've got small.
I'm using the plastic pots.
This also works on fabric pots.
It cinches, it grips.
So let me just show you real quick what I did here to train this plant out.
I just took my medium clip, put it right there on the edge of my planter, nice and sturdy.
Grab my twist tie, put it in, twist it out, bring it up, grab my branch, and hold it down.
And if you want, you can progressively kind of tighten this and bring your branch lower.
Maybe you don't want to do it all at once.
You're not trying to snap the branch off.
So you can kind of slowly, progressively just keep bringing it down and laying your plant
out.
And the end result of that training is a lot more terminal shoots.
And I'm in a tight space, so the more I have, the better.
And I've achieved this through my binder clip grow hack.
So fellas, ladies, please let us know in the comment section what you're doing to help
spread and train your plants when you don't have a trellis.
Be interested to hear what you're doing.
