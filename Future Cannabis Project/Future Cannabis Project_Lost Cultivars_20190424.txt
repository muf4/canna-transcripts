[00:05.120 --> 00:18.580]  Strawberry cough, yeah. That's a deep question for me. It would be something
[00:18.580 --> 00:22.340]  that no one in the cannabis community knows. It's just the rapture. It's an old
[00:22.340 --> 00:28.620]  NL G13 hash plant across from North Carolina. The question was what do you
[00:28.620 --> 00:33.860]  regret losing the most? I lost a plant that would have come out of like the
[00:33.860 --> 00:40.980]  late 80s out of Bryslin and when you lit it, it looked like a burning tire. And I
[00:40.980 --> 00:44.980]  got so high when I smoked it that I'd lay down on the couch and my girl would
[00:44.980 --> 00:48.340]  come in and I'd wake up and she'd be wiping my face with the rag asking me if
[00:48.340 --> 00:53.620]  I was sick because I was feverish. And I would mumble, no I'm just really high. And
[00:53.620 --> 00:59.900]  it had the most complete effect I've ever experienced. And it was stunning
[01:00.060 --> 01:07.820]  cannabis in every aspect. It had a visual quality. It had a growth quality. It had a
[01:07.820 --> 01:15.700]  quality, a high that was unreal. And it got killed by mistake. And I said, oh
[01:15.700 --> 01:19.460]  we'll go find more like that. But I realized quickly that that was a memory.
[01:19.460 --> 01:25.420]  And that was the one I wish I had back more than anyone. It was so green it was
[01:25.420 --> 01:30.140]  almost like blue. And I used to call it like you know like a blue varietal. But it
[01:30.140 --> 01:35.980]  literally would make regular people ill. It would fold you over and
[01:35.980 --> 01:40.420]  kick you in the ass and send you home and say come back when you're grown up.
[01:40.420 --> 01:45.420]  The beauty of cannabis is that all of us have that special thing. And that's why
[01:45.420 --> 01:48.580]  I've always been trying to explain to people you don't have to be a big banker
[01:48.580 --> 01:52.060]  but you got to bank a little bit. You got to make sure you keep some stock. You got
[01:52.060 --> 01:55.860]  to make sure you're involved in some breeding. Don't let anybody talk shit to
[01:55.860 --> 01:59.740]  you because you're a pollen chucker. You're somebody who has historically
[01:59.740 --> 02:03.260]  done what we've done since the dawn of time. You've chosen things to put
[02:03.260 --> 02:08.540]  together for your desire. And when people ask me you know what should I smoke? I'm
[02:08.540 --> 02:12.300]  like I'm not qualified to tell you because I'm not you. I can put you into
[02:12.300 --> 02:16.660]  things and I can help you understand why you like it. But fundamentally I'm not
[02:16.660 --> 02:19.660]  you. I'm not qualified to tell you what you should like. It's like telling
[02:19.740 --> 02:26.620]  someone who they should love. You're not qualified. I know you lost
[02:26.620 --> 02:29.340]  something good man. You've had a lot of stuff in your hand boy.
[02:29.340 --> 02:35.740]  Oh yeah. Don't cry. Oh my god I lost the one. And that's where you come in
[02:35.740 --> 02:40.540]  with the sharing and it's like I being breeding seeds and taking these
[02:40.540 --> 02:44.180]  times it's like they're your children and it's like that's like the one
[02:44.180 --> 02:48.420]  thing it's like spreading that right now and it was like back in the you know the
[02:48.420 --> 02:54.900]  early 90s and running into walls and getting losing these certain genetics
[02:54.900 --> 02:59.300]  and that's like what was drove me back to go to like Southeast Asia. It's like
[02:59.300 --> 03:02.100]  finding this you know that was happy pizzas. I don't know if you've been to
[03:02.100 --> 03:05.980]  Cambodia but you eat this fucking pizza and you're tripping. You know you're in
[03:05.980 --> 03:11.100]  Cambodia on the and there's this different level to that. And this was
[03:11.100 --> 03:15.020]  something when you could grow this and it was a nice producer it would grow
[03:15.020 --> 03:18.300]  under the man's need as well here and you could put it in a mixed bag of
[03:18.300 --> 03:22.940]  tricks and get 5600 a pound for it. It had different colors. It wasn't that
[03:22.940 --> 03:27.780]  name but that's like these are the some old Southeast Asian you know these these
[03:27.780 --> 03:34.220]  long flowering times but just the soaring psychedelic highs and that
[03:34.220 --> 03:40.380]  different feeling and that's part of that backtracking and finding what
[03:40.380 --> 03:44.820]  exactly like one of them with CBD it was reaching out to you know with Ringo
[03:44.820 --> 03:49.180]  and like Jaime when this was when people were first introducing that you know the
[03:49.180 --> 03:53.900]  Juanita La Gramosa and that you know that can of tonic of those old genetics
[03:53.900 --> 03:58.660]  and it's like okay well this was Oaxaca this region Colombia you know where were
[03:58.660 --> 04:03.420]  these things coming from and then trying to search those out and that's like when
[04:03.420 --> 04:07.820]  you mentioned that with Africa what's is getting is we're losing this you know
[04:07.820 --> 04:11.420]  these unique ones that are out there and it's being able to find these
[04:11.420 --> 04:15.900]  special ones but at what point we want to share these but you don't want them
[04:15.900 --> 04:19.700]  to go under the wrong hands and that's something we're gonna be facing right
[04:19.700 --> 04:25.500]  now being breeders I think coming more and more as we've got the bigger players
[04:25.500 --> 04:30.540]  that are coming in and are just they don't realize the time and the energy
[04:30.540 --> 04:35.100]  that's put into these certain cultivars and how rare and special they are and
[04:35.140 --> 04:37.900]  that's something that we have to protect.
[04:37.900 --> 04:39.900]  Drew, Drew.
[04:39.900 --> 04:41.900]  Anything you lose that you wish you had?
[04:41.900 --> 04:51.900]  The strawberry cough I lost that I had right away and I thought about it a lot like I've popped some beans and I haven't found anything that was that.
[04:51.900 --> 04:56.740]  I'm pretty sure it was the strawberry cough because I've seen the cough and it
[04:56.740 --> 05:00.380]  had that you know that's very distinguished like real thick smoke you
[05:00.380 --> 05:06.060]  know but it was the first plant that we ever I remember we had two plants under
[05:06.060 --> 05:11.500]  two lights and we got six pounds and we were like it was like blown away the
[05:11.500 --> 05:14.980]  first time that ever happened and it was very easy to trim just these little
[05:14.980 --> 05:18.900]  golf ball nugs which most the cough is not in the strawberry cough it's is
[05:18.900 --> 05:23.140]  bigger you know denser fluffier but it was was really anyways and it was it was
[05:23.140 --> 05:28.540]  really because I was medicine for me I came into cannabis from a bicycle
[05:28.580 --> 05:32.660]  accident and so I was fucked up I got hit by a car I was fucked up really hard
[05:32.660 --> 05:36.660]  for a couple years and just like learning to grow weed walking around the
[05:36.660 --> 05:39.980]  house smoking as much weed as I could and there was that strawberry cough that
[05:39.980 --> 05:45.900]  like really was able to help me manage so I did was a damn shark's breath that I
[05:45.900 --> 05:49.900]  lost it too I got stuck with the shark's breath cutting and I hated that thing
[05:49.900 --> 05:53.500]  and as I took a cut I thought it was a strawberry and I messed it up and it was
[05:53.500 --> 05:58.140]  the shark's breath and I could never get rid of that fucking plant
